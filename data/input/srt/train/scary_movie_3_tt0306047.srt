It gives me headaches.

There are so many magnetic waves
traveling in the airspace

5
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:27,275
because of TV and television,
we're losing

00:00:27,276 --> 00:00:29,362
10 times as many brain cells
as we're supposed to.

I don't know.
Magnetic waves, brain cells.

13
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,941
I don't understand the
connection between that stuff.

You know what else I heard?

- What?

Have you heard about
this videotape?

26
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,696
Where they do it on the boat?
And then in the car?

27
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:12,737
And then in the bathtub?

28

He's like, "Baby, I love you."
And she's like, "Where are we?"

- Not that tape.
- Oh.

The one with
all the scary images.

32
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,583
After you watch the tape,
the phone rings.

And this scary voice comes on
and says you're gonna die in...

Seven days. I saw that one
with Josh last weekend.

Thank you, Ross.

There's a developing story
in Middleburg at this hour.

00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,119
A mysterious
crop circle appeared

100
00:06:10,223 --> 00:06:13,038
in local farmer Tom Logan's
cornfield.

101

Elaborate prank
or extraterrestrial phenomenon?

102

We'll update you as soon as we
have any further information.

103

But either way,
it's clear something strange

is happening in that small town.

- Cindy, you got a second?
- Sure.

I want you to take a look at
this for that strip club exposé.

But I'd rather stick with
the crop circle story.

Oh, come on. You know
those things are just a hoax.

something about that cornfield.

for all this so-called

00:55:18,198 --> 00:55:20,361
Stop it! Just tell me
what I need to know.

1128
00:55:20,362 --> 00:55:21,717
Who is that little girl?

1129
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:23,698
Okay, okay.

1130
00:55:25,366 --> 00:55:28,911
My wife and I wanted a child,
but she couldn't get pregnant.

1131
00:55:28,912 --> 00:55:30,788
Neither could I.

1132
00:55:30,892 --> 00:55:32,038
So you adopted.

1133
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:34,542
We loved our daughter,
but she was evil.

1134
00:55:34,543 --> 00:55:37,044
Made the horses crazy,
killed our puppies,

1135
00:55:37,045 --> 00:55:38,191
hid the remote.

1136
00:55:38,192 --> 00:55:39,337
Really sick shit.

1137
00:55:39,338 --> 00:55:41,319
My wife took her
to the old family farm

1138
00:55:41,321 --> 00:55:43,300
and drowned her in the well.

1139
00:55:43,301 --> 00:55:46,846
I felt a simple time-out
would have been sufficient.

1140
00:55:46,847 --> 00:55:50,391
But Tabitha imprinted her evil
on a videotape.

1141
00:55:50,392 --> 00:55:52,581
I never meant for it
to get out, but...

1142
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:54,144
But what?

1143
00:55:54,145 --> 00:55:56,856
I put it in the wrong box
and returned it to Blockbuster,

1144
00:55:56,857 --> 00:55:58,732
instead of my copy
of "Pootie Tang."

1145
00:55:58,733 --> 00:56:01,757
It's been circulating
and killing ever since.

1146
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:03,738
Just like "Pootie Tang."

1147
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:06,657
But what does this
have to do with aliens?

1148
00:56:06,658 --> 00:56:07,699
I don't know.

1149
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:10,515
Perhaps Tabitha's summoning them
to kill us all.

1150
00:56:10,516 --> 00:56:13,121
An alien invasion?

1151
00:56:13,122 --> 00:56:14,581
I have to warn the world.

1152
00:56:14,582 --> 00:56:17,606
It's already begun.
You're too late.

1153
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:19,273
Oh, my God.

1154
00:56:19,274 --> 00:56:22,715
But not too late
to make an old man happy.

1155
00:56:23,445 --> 00:56:25,634
What?

1156
00:56:25,635 --> 00:56:28,450
And now reports of lights
in the sky.

1157
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:30,639
Glimpses of spacecraft.

1158
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:35,019
Possible alien sightings being
reported all over the world.

1159
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:36,062
Are they aliens?

1160
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:38,773
The first video images
are coming in.

1161
00:56:38,774 --> 00:56:40,648
Disturbing home video tonight

1162
00:56:40,649 --> 00:56:43,152
from a ranch
outside Sydney, Australia.

1163
00:56:43,153 --> 00:56:45,551
Watch very carefully now.

1164
00:56:45,552 --> 00:56:46,696
There it is.

1165
00:56:46,697 --> 00:56:48,053
Let's see that again.

1166
00:56:49,408 --> 00:56:51,388
Very, very disturbing.

1167
00:56:51,389 --> 00:56:54,830
And this just in
from Sao Paulo, Brazil.

1168
00:56:57,229 --> 00:56:59,001
Let's see that again.

1169
00:57:03,902 --> 00:57:07,343
Very, very disturbing.

1170
00:57:07,447 --> 00:57:10,158
And this just in
from South Texas.

1171
00:57:14,329 --> 00:57:16,101
Do they pose a threat?

1172
00:57:16,102 --> 00:57:18,500
Only one thing's for certain.

1173
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:20,637
We are all going to be killed.

1174
00:57:20,638 --> 00:57:22,774
We have to board up the house.

1175
00:57:22,775 --> 00:57:24,965
HARRIS: Are you sure
this is necessary, Wilson?

1176
00:57:24,966 --> 00:57:27,153
Having an awards ceremony
at a time like this?

1177
00:57:27,155 --> 00:57:30,490
Yes, sir. Everything must
appear business as usual.

1178
00:57:30,491 --> 00:57:33,515
The nation, while not yet
panicked, is deeply disturbed.

1179
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:35,340
Right.
We can steer that course,

1180
00:57:35,341 --> 00:57:37,165
keeping everybody
deeply disturbed.

1181
00:57:37,166 --> 00:57:38,415
We don't want a panic.

1182
00:57:38,416 --> 00:57:40,918
Very few presidents have faced
a crisis like this.

1183
00:57:40,919 --> 00:57:43,942
I wonder what President Ford
would've done.

1184
00:57:43,943 --> 00:57:45,923
Well, if the buck stops here...

1185
00:57:45,924 --> 00:57:47,800
the buck stops here.

1186
00:57:50,094 --> 00:57:53,118
Thank you all,
and welcome to the White House.

1187
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:55,724
The Mother Teresa Awards

1188
00:57:55,725 --> 00:57:57,809
recognize those
who have overcome

1189
00:57:57,810 --> 00:58:00,104
the severest handicaps
and disadvantages

1190
00:58:00,105 --> 00:58:02,398
to help others
in their communities.

1191
00:58:02,502 --> 00:58:05,734
The young, the old.
Black and white.

1192
00:58:05,735 --> 00:58:08,446
Our Native American friends.
Hey, how are you?

1193
00:58:08,447 --> 00:58:11,157
[Chanting] Hey, how are you?
Hey, how are you?

1194
00:58:11,158 --> 00:58:12,408
Hey, how are you?

1195
00:58:12,512 --> 00:58:15,952
Ah.
Well, it is therefore my honor

1196
00:58:15,953 --> 00:58:20,958
to present each and every one of
you with this symbol of merit.

1197
00:58:25,963 --> 00:58:28,049
The room is secure,
Mr. President.

1198
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:30,237
- Or is it?
- Sir?

1199
00:58:30,238 --> 00:58:31,593
I've been thinking, Thompson.

1200
00:58:31,594 --> 00:58:34,096
What if the aliens could
take over human bodies?

1201
00:58:34,097 --> 00:58:35,660
They'd look just like us.

1202
00:58:35,765 --> 00:58:37,016
Or almost.

1203
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,579
I never thought of that, sir.

1204
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:40,978
We should be on alert
for anything suspicious.

1205
00:58:40,979 --> 00:58:42,334
They could be anywhere.

1206
00:58:42,335 --> 00:58:43,585
Even...

1207
00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:44,784
Right here.

1208
00:58:44,785 --> 00:58:45,983
My God.

1209
00:58:46,087 --> 00:58:47,859
We'd never see
the attack coming.

1210
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:51,405
- It's frightening, sir!
- Don't panic.

1211
00:58:51,406 --> 00:58:54,950
We'll just move slowly
toward the exit.

1212
00:58:55,993 --> 00:58:58,704
[Mechanized voice]
At last we meet, Mr. President.

1213
00:58:58,809 --> 00:59:00,216
It's happening.
I knew it.

1214
00:59:00,217 --> 00:59:01,624
You'll never take me alive!

1215
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:02,874
Aaaah!

1216
00:59:02,875 --> 00:59:05,273
Ah!
She's scrambling my brain!

1217
00:59:05,274 --> 00:59:06,629
I'll get her!

1218
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,756
Aaah!

1219
00:59:09,757 --> 00:59:12,468
Oh, no, you don't!
Not on my watch!

1220
00:59:12,469 --> 00:59:14,136
Good work, sir!

1221
00:59:15,805 --> 00:59:18,203
Good God!
The small ones have metal teeth!

1222
00:59:18,204 --> 00:59:20,705
Jerry's kids, my ass!

1223
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:23,311
WILSON:
Mr. President!

1224
00:59:23,312 --> 00:59:26,440
Mr. President, have you gone
completely insane?

1225
00:59:26,441 --> 00:59:27,899
Like a fox.

1226
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,194
We got to talk to the person
who saw this coming,

1227
00:59:30,195 --> 00:59:31,237
Cindy Campbell.

1228
00:59:31,445 --> 00:59:33,114
She knows how
to defeat the aliens.

1229
00:59:33,115 --> 00:59:35,303
- Filthy, rotten scum!
- Aah!

1230
00:59:35,304 --> 00:59:36,815
Aah!
You're hideous!

1231
00:59:36,816 --> 00:59:38,326
Get off my planet!

1232
00:59:38,327 --> 00:59:41,247
- No!
- Is everything all right?

1233
00:59:41,248 --> 00:59:42,498
The exits are all blocked.

1234
00:59:42,499 --> 00:59:44,479
I'll find one, sir.

1235
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,460
Everybody, clear!

1236
00:59:48,546 --> 00:59:51,464
This way, sir!
God, this is exciting!

1237
00:59:51,465 --> 00:59:54,489
You're excited?
You should feel my nipples.

1238
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,261
Cody?

1239
00:59:56,262 --> 00:59:59,494
Cody?
Cody, where are you?

1240
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:00,640
Honey?

1241
01:00:00,641 --> 01:00:02,935
GIGGINS: After today's incident
in the East Room,

1242
01:00:02,936 --> 01:00:05,645
the White House
is now advising all citizens

1243
01:00:05,646 --> 01:00:09,504
to board up their homes and
prepare for an alien invasion.

1244
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:11,277
Oh, no.

1245
01:00:11,486 --> 01:00:13,987
And now a News 8 exclusive.

1246
01:00:13,988 --> 01:00:16,282
The killer videotape
you've been hearing about.

1247
01:00:16,283 --> 01:00:17,950
We're the only station
that has it,

1248
01:00:18,054 --> 01:00:19,617
and we're showing it all night.

1249
01:00:19,618 --> 01:00:21,704
Very exciting.
Let's roll it again.

1250
01:00:26,083 --> 01:00:28,377
There. Nobody's getting
through that sucker.

1251
01:00:28,378 --> 01:00:30,880
But we have to get down
to the cellar.

1252
01:00:32,131 --> 01:00:33,956
- George.
- Cindy.

1253
01:00:33,957 --> 01:00:35,781
There's no time.

1254
01:00:35,885 --> 01:00:37,135
Cody.

1255
01:00:37,136 --> 01:00:39,220
Thank God.
I've been worried sick.

1256
01:00:39,221 --> 01:00:41,933
He showed up about an hour ago.
I tried to call.

1257
01:00:41,934 --> 01:00:43,600
No, he didn't.

1258
01:00:43,601 --> 01:00:45,686
Okay, but I was gonna.

1259
01:00:45,791 --> 01:00:47,562
No, he wasn't.

1260
01:00:47,563 --> 01:00:51,213
Cody, the point is you can't
just run away like that.

1261
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:52,985
I wanted to be with George.

1262
01:00:53,194 --> 01:00:55,905
Oh, honey, I know
you want a dad, but...

1263
01:00:56,009 --> 01:00:59,033
Oh, trust me, Cody,
I'm not good at anything.

1264
01:00:59,034 --> 01:01:00,493
Why would I be good at that?

1265
01:01:00,494 --> 01:01:02,891
SUE:
Uncle George!

1266
01:01:15,091 --> 01:01:17,593
It's gonna be okay, Cody.

1267
01:01:17,594 --> 01:01:20,094
I'm going to die, aren't I?

1268
01:01:20,096 --> 01:01:23,015
Cody, did I ever tell you
what your mom said

1269
01:01:23,016 --> 01:01:25,101
about you
the day you were born?

1270
01:01:25,102 --> 01:01:26,248
No.

1271
01:01:26,352 --> 01:01:28,854
I was in the delivery room
with her.

1272
01:01:28,855 --> 01:01:30,730
She was having a hard time.

1273
01:01:30,731 --> 01:01:32,400
Then you began
to come out of her.

1274
01:01:33,338 --> 01:01:35,528
And your mom screamed
and screamed in pain.

1275
01:01:35,529 --> 01:01:37,300
She yelled, "Just kill me.

1276
01:01:37,301 --> 01:01:39,073
Bludgeon me with a bedpan.

1277
01:01:39,177 --> 01:01:41,992
Whatever you do,
put me out of this pain."

1278
01:01:41,993 --> 01:01:44,181
She was gushing
torrents of blood.

1279
01:01:44,182 --> 01:01:46,998
I have this all on tape
if you want to see it someday.

1280
01:01:46,999 --> 01:01:48,874
Well, finally you came out.

1281
01:01:48,875 --> 01:01:51,794
Your mom cut
your umbilical cord herself.

1282
01:01:51,898 --> 01:01:54,921
Well, on the second try.

1283
01:01:54,922 --> 01:01:57,633
The first time she snipped
your penis in half.

1284
01:01:57,634 --> 01:01:59,197
After all, she was drunk.

1285
01:01:59,198 --> 01:02:00,553
Actually, drugged.

1286
01:02:00,761 --> 01:02:03,889
We'd been out the night before
celebrating St. Patrick's Day.

1287
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:06,184
She thought, "Hey,
I never tasted crystal meth."

1288
01:02:06,185 --> 01:02:08,060
So she did just a little.

1289
01:02:08,165 --> 01:02:09,312
My penis?

1290
01:02:09,313 --> 01:02:10,145
Yes.

1291
01:02:10,146 --> 01:02:12,857
They sewed it on upside down.

1292
01:02:12,858 --> 01:02:14,733
So that's why I pee up?

1293
01:02:14,734 --> 01:02:16,192
Yes.
We'll get it fixed, honey.

1294
01:02:16,193 --> 01:02:19,218
It's on my list of things.
Right after we get TiVo.

1295
01:02:19,218 --> 01:02:20,989
Anyway, there you were.

1296
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:23,440
Your mom turned to me and said,

1297
01:02:23,441 --> 01:02:25,891
"Hey, you want him?
Take him."

1298
01:02:25,892 --> 01:02:27,507
Then she died.

1299
01:02:27,508 --> 01:02:29,462
And I took you.

1300
01:02:29,463 --> 01:02:31,416
Do you know why?

1301
01:02:31,417 --> 01:02:33,084
I had just lost my cat
in a fire,

1302
01:02:33,085 --> 01:02:35,067
and I needed something
to pet and feed.

1303
01:02:35,068 --> 01:02:37,986
And I miss that cat, Cody.

1304
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:39,549
But I love you.

1305
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:41,739
And nothing's
ever gonna change that,

1306
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:44,347
not even the very painful death
we're about to experience.

It was Uncle George.

Good work, Sue.

I don't know what stupid,
idiotic thing

made these lights go off.

1319
01:03:18,026 --> 01:03:20,633
All right, there's spare fuses
in the crawl space.

1320

I can get these lights back on.

Please, no.
We mean you no harm.

01:08:10,923 --> 01:08:13,843
We traveled to your planet
to find an evil little girl.

There's something
about this place.

Oh, my God.
