We'll get to that in a minute.

Because what it represents is
as important as what it is.

It's a tool for the heart.

163
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:09,874
But you're an asshole.

164
00:13:12,418 --> 00:13:13,461
Well, that...

165
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:14,545
Hey. Let me finish.

166
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,340
I want you here.
I really do.

167
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:21,552
Something's gotta change.

168
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,307
Give me my own project.
What?

169
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,892
Give me my own project.

170
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:30,352
I'll do it on my own.

171
00:13:30,436 --> 00:13:33,606
And I'll make the best damn
game you have ever seen.

172
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,566
You're serious.

173
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:39,236
Okay, Steve.

174
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,947
I need someone to reprogram
a troublesome game.

175
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:43,199
But I'm on a tight deadline.

176
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:45,743
So if you can deliver,

177
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,745
we'll pay you up to $5,000.

178
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,624
$5,000?
Mmm-hmm.

179
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:53,834
Okay.

180
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:58,422
And as for your personal issues,
I think I may have a solution.

181
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:06,722
So many circuits.

182
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:09,600
(SIGHING)

183
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:30,079
Woz? Hey, it's Steve.

184
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,470
Thanks for saving my ass.

185
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:53,769
Of course. We're friends.
That's, that's what friends do.

186
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:03,320
I just can't work
for other people.

187
00:15:06,991 --> 00:15:11,745
I guess I need my independence.
If that makes any sense.

188
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:13,831
Uh-huh.

189
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:16,542
That makes perfect sense.

190
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,632
I'm sorry for ruining
your Friday night.

191
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:27,595
Are you kidding me?
This is great.

192
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,639
I'd do this for free.
I really would.

193
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:34,518
But just out of curiosity,
how much are we getting paid?

194
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,022
$700.
(WHISTLES)

195
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:42,276
Some big bucks there.

196
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:54,747
ALCORN: Shit.

197
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:57,916
This is good. Really good.

198
00:15:58,584 --> 00:15:59,710
I know.

199
00:16:01,337 --> 00:16:04,298
ALCORN: Wow. Four days.
You aren't kidding around.

200
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:08,469
I'll have to show it to Nolan,
but this is, this is good.

201
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:24,985
Woz?

202
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:26,487
WOZNIAK: Hi. Hi.

203
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:30,157
Woz!

204
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,618
Hi! Yeah, I'm
in the living room.

205
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:34,495
Hey. Good news.

206
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:36,997
Huh? Let me guess, your
bosses liked the video game.

207
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:38,499
They loved it!
Ooh.

208
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,293
$350. Whew! That's not bad.

209
00:16:41,377 --> 00:16:43,253
Not bad? It's great.

210
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:45,839
What are you working on?

211
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:48,509
I'm writing jokes for
my dial-a-joke machine.

212
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:51,929
I've got some really good funny Polish
jokes, which work because I'm Polish.

213
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:53,847
Hang out and tell me what
you think of this one.

214
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:55,015
Ready? Ready?

215
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:58,852
What is long, and hard, that a Polish
bride gets on her wedding night?

216
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,688
A new last name.

217
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,231
(LAUGHS)

218
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:05,859
That's hilarious.

219
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:07,778
Pretty good, isn't it?

220
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,239
What do you call a beautiful
Polish girl? Lucky.

221
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:15,869
What's that?

222
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:17,287
Hmm?

223
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:21,208
Oh.

224
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:25,546
That. Now that
is gonna be cool.

225
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,632
It's a computer terminal board
I'm working on.

226
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:32,302
Hooks up to the TV
for the display.

227
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:36,265
What is it like, a kit?
What do you mean?

228
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:37,725
Well, well...

229
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:38,976
The code is still buggy,

230
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:42,271
but in theory it'll display
whatever you're working on. Like...

231
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:43,605
Show me.

232
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,691
Show you. Okay.

233
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:07,963
Wow.

234
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,681
(GASPS)

235
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:26,732
JOBS: I don't care if HP
didn't like it. It matters.

236
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,025
WOZNIAK: Yeah.
It's got potential.

237
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:31,570
JOBS: No, the Sex Pistols have potential.
This is the wheel.

238
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:32,893
It's the Industrial Revolution.

239
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,157
No more decks,
no more mainframes.

240
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,408
That changes everything.

241
00:18:36,492 --> 00:18:37,576
It's pretty cool, I guess.

242
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:38,786
Hi, Charlene. Hello.
Hey.

243
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:42,748
Cool. It's profound. How could you
not tell me about this before?

244
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:45,209
I don't know. I was just working on it for my own.
It, it was a hobby.

245
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:48,170
Exactly. Exactly.
For your own. For you.

246
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:52,299
It's what you wanted. It's what
your gut, your instinct wanted.

247
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:55,344
Your big evolved brain wanted
something that didn't exist,

248
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:58,222
so you just willed it
into existence.

249
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:00,669
It's, what do you
call the system?

250
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:01,725
The operating system?

251
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,894
The operating, and it just shows you...
That's what I call it.

252
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,355
Yeah, it's just a real time
display of current operations.

253
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:09,483
You can see what you're working
on while you're working on it.

254
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:10,818
Okay. Look...

255
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:12,027
Don't you get this?
This is freedom.

256
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,656
This is freedom to create,
and to do, and to build,

257
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:17,616
as artists, as individuals.
Look, look, look.

258
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,535
But look, you're overreacting.

259
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:23,413
Even if you were developing this for
freaks like us, and I doubt you are,

260
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:26,333
nobody wants to buy
a computer. Nobody.

261
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:30,003
How does somebody know what they
want if they've never even seen it?

262
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:31,088
Huh?

263
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,092
We're going to Homebrew.

264
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:38,095
No...

265
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:41,306
lam not presenting
anything at Homebrew.

266
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,183
I'm... No.

267
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,105
Why do people drive so slow?
Get out! Move!

268
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,108
I'm telling you right now,
I've been to Homebrew.

269
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:52,693
I understand the caliber
of people who speak there.

270
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:54,236
I'm not one of those people.

271
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:56,697
I'm telling you this thing is amazing.
I'm not...

272
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,365
You're gonna be great, Woz.

273
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,951
Steve, could you do me a
favor, could you just please

274
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,536
slow down a little bit
so that I feel like

275
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:05,581
there's a chance we might
actually get there alive.

276
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:08,125
I want to get there first
so we present first.

277
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:11,044
You know if we're
gonna do this thing,

278
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:12,368
we need to come up with a name.

279
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,099
Yeah, I know. Something catchy.
Something...

280
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:15,257
I've been thinking about it.

281
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,466
Electric.

282
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:19,011
It needs to feel like...
I don't know.

283
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:21,179
What about
Enterprise Computers?

284
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:22,264
No.

285
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:23,849
No Star Trek names.
I swear.

286
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,142
What about Kirk Enterprises?

287
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,393
I will drive this car
right off this road.

288
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:27,477
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine!

289
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:28,729
I will run the car
right off the road.

290
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:30,731
Jesus! Calm down! Seriously.

291
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:32,983
Okay. Nothing Trekkie. Jesus.

292
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:36,945
It just needs to be, like, something
that people will relate to, you know?

293
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:38,749
Like, it needs to be
something that you see,

294
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:41,575
and you're just, like,
"Man, I just gotta have it."

295
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:46,413
Apple.

296
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:48,624
Excuse me?

297
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,169
Apple.
Apple, like the fruit?

298
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:55,923
The fruit of creation. Apple.
It's simple but sophisticated.

299
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:58,675
It comes before Atari
in the phone book, too.

300
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:04,014
That is so much better
than Phaser Beam Computers.

301
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,767
It's naming it after a fruit.

302
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,477
Apple. Apple Computer.

303
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:11,063
But, what about Apple Records?

304
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:13,273
Apple Records?
The Beatles' label, stu...

305
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:14,775
What, they own
the word "apple"?

306
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:16,026
Why do you always
hate The Beatles?

307
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,152
Well, I do not
hate The Beatles.

308
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:18,987
Yes, you do. You always...
I do not hate The Beatles.

309
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:21,071
They're just, they're not
Dylan, and you know that.

310
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:23,073
Okay, and that's a comparison
that you always make.

311
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,316
Well, I...
'Cause it's obvious.

312
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:25,535
And I don't think it's fair.

313
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:28,413
Apple. Really? Apple?

314
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:31,667
Right, listen. If we come up with
something better, we'll change it.

315
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,544
Let's just go with it
and see if it sticks.

316
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:47,057
WOZNIAK: It will display
up to 192 memory locations

317
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,476
on the monitor simultaneously.

318
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:54,606
Allow me to explain because it's
quite fascinating, actually.

319
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:59,403
The logic board is rather complex,
especially compared to some of

320
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:02,739
the other boards here,
including of course,

321
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:05,492
the Altair.

322
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:07,411
(AUDIENCE MURMURING)

323
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:09,037
And as you can see...

324
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:13,208
it's much smaller, and cheaper
to manufacture and build...

325
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:17,379
which, by using
dynamic RAM, I was able...

326
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:23,260
We were able to shrink the size
of the board substantially.

327
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,262
So, it works with
your television?

328
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:27,097
Yes, YES, yes, yes!

329
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:31,351
It will work on any
television, or video monitor.

330
00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:35,022
All you need is
a radio frequency converter

331
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:38,900
to display the images
from your microprocessor

332
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:40,986
to your set output device.

333
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:44,448
And it'll run BASIC.

334
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:52,289
It will also run BASIC, which
I think could be a great...

335
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:57,377
So I guess that wraps it up. Thank
you very much for your time.

336
00:22:57,627 --> 00:23:00,839
This was terrific. Fuck.

337
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:03,133
(WHISPERING) Tough crowd.

338
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:06,887
Good evening, gentlemen.
I'm Frank.

339
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,013
I'm Lutz.

340
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:12,142
And we're here with reduced
instruction set computing CPU.

341
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:22,903
Excuse me.
Name is Paul Terrell.

342
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:26,490
Saw your presentation.

343
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:27,991
And?

344
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:29,701
And I'd like to talk business.

345
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:33,246
What can I do for you?
Well...

346
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,583
I own a local computer parts
store, in Mountainview.

347
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:37,793
The Byte Shop?

348
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:39,086
You buy computer parts.

349
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:42,631
Yeah. We sell transistors, boards,
soldering equipment, monitors.

350
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:44,174
You know, hobbyist types.

351
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:45,383
Like Radio Shack?

352
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:47,177
No.

353
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:51,139
Listen, why don't you stop
by and talk to me some time.

354
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:53,433
There's my card.
Give me a call.

355
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,102
Great.

356
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:56,478
It was nice meeting you.

357
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:58,063
Steve Jobs.

358
00:23:58,188 --> 00:23:59,648
Steve Jobs. All right.

359
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,362
Who was that?

360
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:08,365
It's Paul Terrell.
Oh.

361
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:11,118
Who?

362
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:49,656
So what kind of investment
are we talking about here?

363
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:53,535
Jesus, Steve. I said I was
interested, not buying.

364
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:57,080
I know. But you're also not
the only interested party.

365
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:58,874
Oh, really? I'm not?
No.

366
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:00,000
You're not.
Hmm.

367
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,168
That's interesting.

368
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:03,378
Because it sure seemed that way
the other night at Homebrew.

369
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:06,089
You think that's the
first stop that we made?

370
00:25:06,882 --> 00:25:08,300
We've been all over The Valley.

371
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:11,595
Oh, well, then you
already have a retailer.

372
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:12,929
I got offers.

373
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:17,350
Look, Paul My middle name's Paul.
My dad's name is Paul.

374
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:19,227
Bunch of Pauls. I'm...

375
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:20,812
I think we're
kindred spirits here.

376
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:24,482
We're both businessmen
that operate from our gut.

377
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:28,069
And my gut tells me to
give you this opportunity.

378
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:36,703
I'm thinking $400 per machine, for 50
units, paid at the time of delivery.

379
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:40,790
$400 for a hundred units,
a third up front.

380
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:42,000
We're not negotiating.

381
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:43,126
Yes, we are.

382
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:51,426
Okay. I'll pay $450
per machine. $450.

383
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:56,223
On delivery, nothing up front. I
know it's asking a lot, Steve.

384
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:58,892
But it's a big payoff
if you deliver.

385
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:00,977
When I deliver.

386
00:26:04,648 --> 00:26:07,359
$500 per unit and
you've got a deal.

387
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:13,740
All right.
You got 90 days.

388
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:16,534
I'll have it in 60.

389
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:24,876
Daniel and I just didn't have
room at our place, so...

390
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,920
PAUL: No, no.
I'm glad you asked.

391
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:32,425
We could move some things around,
give it a good cleaning.

392
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:35,262
I could move most of
my tools to the shed.

393
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:37,639
Maybe get you boys
a fan when it gets hot.

394
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:38,807
Ooh.

395
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:41,977
What do you think?

396
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:43,853
It's great, Dad.

397
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:46,481
Yes. It is.
This is perfect.

398
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:50,235
Good. Well, it'll be good to
see you building something.

399
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:56,157
Good. Hey, keep it neat.

00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:00,996

Mmm.

402
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:08,253

00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:10,922

It's gotta be straighter. These
have to be more symmetrical.

409

We have 60 days to
complete 50 of these,

410
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,600
and you're worried
about the symmetry?

411
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:46,041
Steve, nobody cares
about the look of the board.

412
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:48,084
I care.
Well, that's just great.

413
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:50,855
But we were out of time the minute
you made that stupid promise.

00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:54,924
You're right.

three people right now.

We can't afford to pay
ourselves, unless we deliver.

437

And don't worry about Chris. He's just a kid.
So he just wants to help.

for 50 computers.

That's keyboards, cases,
monitors, and power included.

00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:57,899
Not just boards.

450
00:30:58,316 --> 00:31:02,612
Just boards? Excuse me? Just boards?
These are state-of-the-art.

451
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:06,991
The logic boards alone are...
Nobody's making anything like this.

452

They're, what, how dare you!
How dare you!

453
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:13,623
I think what my colleague
is saying is that...

454
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:16,834
You're not seeing
the possibilities here.

455

That is indeed one unbelievably
kick ass computer.

456
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:22,090
Not to the consumer.

457
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:23,466
Well, then maybe your consumer

458
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,093
should start to learn how to...

459
00:31:25,176 --> 00:31:26,302
How to even work that,
don't you think?

460
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:28,012
Listen, boys.

461
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:33,059
You sold me on a home computer.
That's a keyboard and monitor.

462
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:34,686
This is a board.

463
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:37,063
Now, I'm sure this makes
a very capable starter kit,

464
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:38,565
but the everyday person,

465

that's not an engineer,

They want to take it out
of the box, plug it in,

471
00:31:52,537 --> 00:31:54,372
and have it work.

You know what it's capable of
with the right components,

479
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:17,061
which, by the way,
all of which you sell.

480
00:32:19,397 --> 00:32:21,524
So, demo it to the consumer.

481
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:23,735
And market
the components separately.

482
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,029
You show them your keyboards,
and your monitors.

483
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,739
You'll move more
inventory that way,

484
00:32:27,822 --> 00:32:29,657
and you'll make a hell
of a lot more cash.

485
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:33,286
You got me.

486
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:39,626
All right, Steve.

487
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:41,502
I'll try to sell them.

488
00:32:42,545 --> 00:32:46,299
But if I don't, I'm not
making another order.

489
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:48,468
Okay. That's fine.

490
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:52,055
But I think that you might be really
interested in our second model.

491
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:53,848
What's the second model?

492
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:57,143
WOZNIAK: What are
you talking about?

493
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:00,063
All-in-one.

494
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:34,681
Can I help you?

495
00:33:34,764 --> 00:33:36,265
Yeah, I'm Rod Holt.

496
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:40,311
The technician.
We talked on the phone.

497
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:42,980
Of course. It's Rod.

498
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:48,861
Glad you could stop by.

499
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:52,115
Welcome to Apple Computer.

500
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:56,160
All right.

501
00:33:58,413 --> 00:34:01,332
Show me this
revolutionary piece of shit.

502
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:03,376
The Apple ll.

503
00:34:04,836 --> 00:34:08,464
It's the first ever all-in-one
personal home computer.

504
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:10,299
And you called me because?

505
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:16,097
We need a heat efficient power supply.
In the case.

506
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:18,641
(SCOFFING) That's impossible,
but don't mind me.

507
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:20,685
I'm just, you know,
an engineer.

508
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:22,395
What's the wattage?

509
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:24,772
40 watts. And quiet.

510
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,650
What the hell do you mean, quiet?
I mean silent.

511
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:29,610
There's no such thing.

512
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:32,405
These things run hot.
They need fans in them.

513
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:33,823
Those bitches ain't quiet.

514
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,158
(SIGHS)

515
00:34:36,075 --> 00:34:38,077
JOBS: That's exactly
why we need you.

516
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:40,455
To redesign it.

517
00:34:40,997 --> 00:34:42,206
Redesign what?

518
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,584
The power supply.
From scratch.

519
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:48,796
It can't have a fan,
it can't overheat.

520
00:34:49,005 --> 00:34:52,675
And it needs to fit
inside a box this size.

521
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:06,105
Don't do that.
Please, don't do...

522
00:35:06,189 --> 00:35:08,524
Whatever.
Do whatever you want.

523
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:17,492
(CHUCKLES)

524
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:21,037
My rate is $200 a day.

525
00:35:21,454 --> 00:35:23,956
And if I ever think things
aren't working out, I walk.

526
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,041
Mmm-hmm.

527
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:26,667
Are we clear?

528
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,170
We're clear.

529
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:34,342
We're talking about the future.

530
00:35:34,425 --> 00:35:37,220
We're working in a market
that doesn't even exist yet.

531
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,806
What Intel has done
for the microprocessor,

532
00:35:40,056 --> 00:35:42,600
we are gonna do for
the home computer.

533
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:44,560
(LAUGHS)

534
00:35:46,604 --> 00:35:49,190
How can you not know
what I'm talking about?

535
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,780
No, ma'am. But it
runs on a TV monitor.

536
00:35:57,073 --> 00:35:59,742
Yes, like a television set.
Exactly.

537
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:04,747
I don't think you understand. It's not a TV.
It's a personal computer.

538
00:36:05,373 --> 00:36:07,667
Okay, do you own a typewriter?

539
00:36:08,251 --> 00:36:11,963
Great. Okay, now do you use it?
Perfect.

540
00:36:12,088 --> 00:36:16,509
So imagine combining your typewriter
with your television set.

541
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,180
No. Don't... Wait. Wait!

542
00:36:21,264 --> 00:36:24,100
Wait. Please, sir,
don't, don't hang up.

543
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:29,939
Yes. We are small
right now, but we...

544
00:36:31,274 --> 00:36:34,235
How do you know we're
working out of our garage?

545
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:36,404
Who told you that?

546
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:40,074
Ahhh!

547
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:41,284
(GROANS)

548
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:43,953
Yes. Yes.

549
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,539
Well, thank you
for taking the time.

550
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:52,545
Yes, sir. Apple Computer.

551
00:36:53,796 --> 00:36:56,883
Apple? Yes, like the fruit.

552
00:36:59,302 --> 00:37:00,636
Who's that?

553
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:06,142
No. No. All I'm asking is
that you come visit us.

554
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:09,770
One meeting and I promise
you'll be on board.

555
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:13,774
Around $50,000
would be my guess.

556
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,944
Hello?

557
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:26,162
What did they say?

558
00:37:48,476 --> 00:37:50,853
What the hell is
the matter with people?

559
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:52,521
Take it the call went well.

560
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:58,194
I would say I hope you choke, but that
burrito is gonna kill you either way.

561
00:37:58,361 --> 00:37:59,820
KOTTKE: Oh, come on, Steve.

562
00:37:59,904 --> 00:38:01,739
Cool your jets, man.

563
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:03,324
Excuse you?

564
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:05,993
Just, you know, you're
so stressed, you know?

565
00:38:06,077 --> 00:38:08,037
It's, like, relax for a change.

566
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:11,540
For a change... Why? Why? So I can
be more like you two assholes?

567
00:38:11,624 --> 00:38:15,127
Hey. I'm studying integrated
circuit design here, man.

568
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:16,379
Are you?

569
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:19,006
We each do our part.

570
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:22,718
Really? Then why do I suddenly
feel like your part is expendable?

571
00:38:24,053 --> 00:38:27,682
Out here smokin' up like we're in India.
Well, wake up! We're not.

572
00:38:30,685 --> 00:38:31,769
What happened to you?

573
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:33,521
You used to be...
What? I used to be what?

574
00:38:33,604 --> 00:38:35,189
Motivated.
I am motivated.

575
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:36,565
Really? Then show me.

576
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:38,943
This is a business, Daniel.

577
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:41,862
And I can't help you
if you don't help yourself.

578
00:38:43,614 --> 00:38:46,242
I'm in there making
a hundred phone calls.

579
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:48,869
Rod is slaving away.

580
00:38:49,245 --> 00:38:51,080
The kid always finds
something to do,

581
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:52,415
and God knows Woz
pulls his weight.

582
00:38:52,498 --> 00:38:53,541
Thank you.

583
00:38:53,624 --> 00:38:55,084
And that's
a whole lot of weight.

584
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,586
That really... That kind
of hurts my feelings.

585
00:39:04,927 --> 00:39:06,012
Whoa.

586
00:39:11,142 --> 00:39:14,270
Is this the right...

587
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:16,856
Apple Computer?

588
00:39:17,815 --> 00:39:19,400
Yeah, this is us.
Yeah.

589
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:20,643
You expecting something else?

590
00:39:22,737 --> 00:39:26,907
Uh, no. Well, yeah, maybe something
a little less Manson Family.

591
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:29,702
It's a startup.
Yeah.

592
00:39:30,036 --> 00:39:31,495
I'm Mike Markkula.

593
00:39:32,496 --> 00:39:33,998
Steve. Jobs.

594
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:36,208
Steve. I heard
a lot about you.

595
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:38,836
You spoke to Don Valentine
on the phone.

596
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:40,588
He and I are old
colleagues of sorts.

597
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:42,882
The VC from Atari.

598
00:39:43,007 --> 00:39:45,801
Yeah, Valentine. He said
you called him 150 times.

599
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:47,219
Jesus.

600
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:50,222
He practically begged me to come
and look at your outfit here.

601
00:39:50,306 --> 00:39:51,724
Called in a personal favor.

602
00:39:52,558 --> 00:39:53,642
Well, Mark.

603
00:39:53,726 --> 00:39:54,810
Mike.

604
00:39:54,894 --> 00:39:56,353
Mike.

605
00:39:58,189 --> 00:39:59,648
Welcome to Apple Computer.

606
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:02,651
MARKKULA: Thank you.
Yeah, is this...

607
00:40:03,486 --> 00:40:04,487
This is everything?

608
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,821
Yes.
No.

609
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:08,282
No. We're, we're in six stores
in the greater area.

610
00:40:08,783 --> 00:40:11,327
We'll be launching the
Apple ll in about a month.

611
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:13,412
In a few months.
It's close.

612
00:40:13,496 --> 00:40:16,665
Gentlemen, is there
some place we can talk?

613
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:18,918
(CLOCK CHIMES)

614
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,089
CLARA: Here you are, fellas.

615
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:24,757
For you.

616
00:40:25,925 --> 00:40:29,303
(WHISPERING) Steve's a fruitarian.
He will only eat fruit.

617
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:33,432
Okay, boys. I'll leave
you to your business.

618
00:40:33,516 --> 00:40:34,558
Thank you.

619
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:36,310
Thanks, Mom.
Thanks, Mrs. J.

620
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:37,645
You're the best.

621
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:41,065
Yeah. So where were we?

622
00:40:41,148 --> 00:40:45,027
I'm sorry, don't take this the
wrong way, but what's your angle?

623
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:46,153
Uh...

624
00:40:46,237 --> 00:40:47,798
What my colleague is
trying to say is...

625
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:49,198
Where was your last employment?

626
00:40:54,036 --> 00:40:55,079
Intel.

627
00:40:58,207 --> 00:40:59,687
So how much are we
talking about here?

628
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:01,627
What, the investment? That's
what you came here for.

629
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,838
Foreplay is not
Steve's strong suit.

630
00:41:03,921 --> 00:41:05,131
Isn't it?

631
00:41:06,215 --> 00:41:07,633
Yeah, well,

632
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:13,556
I've been looking for something
to really sink my teeth into.

633
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:24,066
Look, Steve. I'm willing
to take the risk.

634
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:27,069
And, this certainly qualifies.

635
00:41:27,361 --> 00:41:29,238
But risk disguised as promise.

636
00:41:29,405 --> 00:41:31,615
And you've shown promise.
I've seen it in your eye,

637
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,909

because I've had it myself.

Yeah. Okay. To the point.

with around 90 grand,

gonna get it done.

in your garage with a checkbook.

Oh, no, no.

648

gets it done for us.

649

I just don't think it
gets it done for you.

650

We'll do the
$90,000 investment.

At a $300,000 valuation.

But I also want you to kick
in a $250,000 credit line

00:42:18,537 --> 00:42:20,873
with 10% interest to
be paid back in full

654

Now, the first thing
you need to do

is incorporate, so that you two as

When I founded this company,

710
00:47:29,431 --> 00:47:31,225
I had one goal in mind.

711
00:47:31,808 --> 00:47:35,187
And that was to do what nobody
else considered possible.

712
00:47:35,896 --> 00:47:38,232
To put the power and the beauty

in the hands and homes of

that after today,

Do you know why
people buy an Apple?

Why do they buy an Apple,
not the competitor?

Because it's got bravado.

735
00:50:03,752 --> 00:50:05,504
It's social status.

736

No, you know what?
It's even more than that.

737
00:50:07,089 --> 00:50:08,423
It's social currency.

we've gotta risk it, too.

gamble on our vision

than make a me-too product.

753
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:58,473
What happens if I click
on one of these tabs?

754
00:50:58,557 --> 00:51:01,143
You get a drop-down menu,
and then there's preferences,

and page options.

00:51:02,519 --> 00:51:04,062
Okay. Exactly.

757
00:51:04,896 --> 00:51:09,609
Now, which tab do I click on
to get different font styles?

758
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:19,161
How many custom typefaces
are there on LisaWrite?

759

That's actually something that I wanted
to talk to you about, Steve, is...

760

the fonts for months.

about is conceptual.

exactly a pressing issue right now.

If we want to make the
vision for Lisa a reality,

765

we gotta put in the hours
and make something great.

Yeah, but we have a hard
date on this software,

00:53:27,998 --> 00:53:29,958
Daniel. Hey.

795
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:32,335
Do you have a second to talk?

796
00:53:35,046 --> 00:53:37,048
I thought we rescheduled.

797
00:53:37,465 --> 00:53:39,342
It'll only take a second.

798
00:53:40,176 --> 00:53:41,595
That's what everyone says.

799
00:53:41,678 --> 00:53:42,762
Steve.

800
00:53:48,602 --> 00:53:49,811
Fine.

801
00:53:50,979 --> 00:53:54,608
I don't have a lunch, so, meet
me at Good Earth at noon.

802
00:53:55,317 --> 00:53:56,902
Okay. Cool.
Okay.

803
00:53:57,611 --> 00:53:58,972
What are you
working on these days?

804
00:53:59,279 --> 00:54:00,488
Oh, um...

805
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,949
Apple ll Plus repairs, mainly.

806
00:54:04,367 --> 00:54:05,535
Right.

807
00:54:13,627 --> 00:54:14,948
ATTORNEY:
I need you to sign this.

808
00:54:15,003 --> 00:54:16,504
It legally preserves
your visitation rights.

809
00:54:16,588 --> 00:54:20,967
JOBS: I don't want them.
Lisa Brennan is not my child.

810
00:54:21,551 --> 00:54:23,136
ATTORNEY: The courts disagree.

811
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:27,432
Chris-Ann is a lunatic. It's impossible.
At the very least, improbable.

812
00:54:27,515 --> 00:54:28,767
You knew going into this

813
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:31,853
the paternity test could prove
that you were the father.

814
00:54:32,562 --> 00:54:34,314
There are 24 million
people in California.

815
00:54:34,397 --> 00:54:36,157
That test has a five
percent margin of error.

816
00:54:36,191 --> 00:54:39,527
That's 1.2 million people that
could be the father of that child.

817
00:54:39,611 --> 00:54:41,488
It's not me.

818
00:54:43,198 --> 00:54:47,243
You don't need to convince me.
But you do need to sign this.

819
00:54:47,827 --> 00:54:50,622
Miss Brennan is entitled
to your child support

820
00:54:50,705 --> 00:54:53,500
regardless of whether
you sign it or not.

821
00:54:53,792 --> 00:54:57,045
Do you really want to give
up the rights to see your...

822
00:54:57,128 --> 00:54:59,839
To see her child in the future?

823
00:54:59,923 --> 00:55:01,800
I don't have time.

824
00:55:02,384 --> 00:55:03,426
Not now.

825
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:06,972
Steven, as a father, I
implore you to sign this.

826
00:55:07,597 --> 00:55:10,809
Regardless of whether you think
Lisa is your daughter or not.

827
00:55:11,476 --> 00:55:13,561
There's no risk in signing.

828
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:16,564
Only the regret if you don't.

829
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:29,661
Frederick Rodney Holt,
he recently made

830
00:55:29,953 --> 00:55:32,080
an additional
preferred purchase

831
00:55:32,163 --> 00:55:36,918
of 106,656 shares
at 19 cents a share.

832
00:55:37,419 --> 00:55:39,129
Right, and to be clear,
this new purchase,

833
00:55:39,212 --> 00:55:41,089
it does not affect
Mr. Holt's entitlement to

834
00:55:41,506 --> 00:55:42,924
founder stock.

835
00:55:43,008 --> 00:55:44,843
No, not at all. Steve?

836
00:55:44,926 --> 00:55:47,053
No, no, no.
Rod gets his due.

837
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:48,972
Daniel Kottke,

838
00:55:49,055 --> 00:55:53,184
engineering technician, founding employee.
Now, at our last meeting I,

839
00:55:53,852 --> 00:55:55,770
I don't believe that
we met a consensus

840
00:55:55,854 --> 00:55:59,649
as to Mr. Kottke's entitlement
to founder stock.

841
00:56:00,692 --> 00:56:02,902
Well, in all honesty,
to be rewarding Daniel

842
00:56:02,986 --> 00:56:05,155
with the same amount
of stock as Rod seems

843
00:56:05,238 --> 00:56:07,407
a bit unfair.
Doesn't it?

844
00:56:08,908 --> 00:56:11,494
Yes. Daniel gets nothing.

845
00:56:11,995 --> 00:56:13,079
Nothing?

846
00:56:13,621 --> 00:56:14,706
Don't you think you should

847
00:56:14,789 --> 00:56:16,833
think about what you're
doing, for a second?

848
00:56:17,125 --> 00:56:20,295
I have thought about it.
Daniel gets nothing.

849
00:56:21,254 --> 00:56:22,338
Yes, sir.

850
00:56:22,422 --> 00:56:23,882
It's noted.

851
00:56:24,966 --> 00:56:26,342
What?

852
00:56:26,718 --> 00:56:29,387
Any low grade technician
could do his job.

853
00:56:29,471 --> 00:56:32,432
I've been feeding him for years.
It's not personal.

854
00:56:32,515 --> 00:56:34,893
Don't give me that bullshit, Steve.
Of course it's personal.

855
00:56:34,976 --> 00:56:36,186
He can barely do his job.

856
00:56:36,269 --> 00:56:37,479
If we give Daniel
preferred stock,

857
00:56:37,562 --> 00:56:40,398
some engineer with 10 times
his talent gets nothing.

858
00:56:40,482 --> 00:56:41,566
Then what happens?

859
00:56:41,649 --> 00:56:43,693
Then we just draw this line
right here, right now, okay?

860
00:56:43,777 --> 00:56:45,862
So you, what are you talking about?
Management, or...

861
00:56:45,945 --> 00:56:47,238
Management and engineers.

862
00:56:47,322 --> 00:56:48,323
Yeah, this means...

863
00:56:48,406 --> 00:56:50,492
I know what it means, Mike.

864
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:52,160
Thanks.

865
00:56:53,536 --> 00:56:55,789
No, he's...
You know what, I don't...

866
00:56:57,207 --> 00:56:59,084
Okay then.
Shall we continue?

867
00:57:00,126 --> 00:57:01,711
We can assume
that Bill Fernandez,

868
00:57:01,795 --> 00:57:03,088
Randy Wiggington

869
00:57:03,171 --> 00:57:04,964
and Chris Espinosa will not

870
00:57:05,048 --> 00:57:06,424
be receiving

871
00:57:06,508 --> 00:57:08,051
any Options?

872
00:57:16,351 --> 00:57:18,144
(PLAYING HARMONICA)

873
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:32,200
Drinking a beer, huh?

874
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:36,788
Tomorrow's a big day for you.

875
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:39,415
For us.

876
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:41,709
For us.

877
00:57:43,711 --> 00:57:48,258
Mike told me about what
happened with Bill and Dan

878
00:57:49,634 --> 00:57:54,430
and Chris. And, Steve...

879
00:57:56,474 --> 00:57:57,684
Why'd you do it?

880
00:57:57,934 --> 00:58:00,186
The company outgrew them.

881
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:03,106
They're not management.
They're not project leads.

882
00:58:03,815 --> 00:58:05,400
It's not my job to
be nice to people.

883
00:58:05,483 --> 00:58:07,068
It's my job to
make them better.

884
00:58:07,485 --> 00:58:08,862
They don't deserve it.

885
00:58:08,945 --> 00:58:10,822
Then who the hell does?

886
00:58:10,905 --> 00:58:12,266
Do you know how
this company works?

887
00:58:12,949 --> 00:58:14,159
Do you want to know?

888
00:58:14,284 --> 00:58:16,911
I'd be happy to teach you,
if you want to know.

889
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:22,250
Do you know why I started
this company with you?

890
00:58:23,418 --> 00:58:27,505
Why I left the safety
of HP for this?

891
00:58:27,589 --> 00:58:30,300
I doubt you do.
You never asked.

892
00:58:32,427 --> 00:58:34,637
I left because
this was my thing.

893
00:58:35,096 --> 00:58:37,599
And you guys thought
it was cool.

894
00:58:38,266 --> 00:58:40,852
I just wanted to be
one of the guys.

895
00:58:43,605 --> 00:58:48,776
And of all the guys I knew,
you were the coolest.

896
00:58:49,986 --> 00:58:52,447
You were smart,
quick-witted.

897
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:56,451
And this was my chance
to do what I loved.

898
00:58:57,952 --> 00:59:00,288
And to do it for fun.

899
00:59:02,207 --> 00:59:04,626
That's all, that's
all I ever wanted.

900
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:08,004
I thought that's what
you wanted, too.

901
00:59:12,133 --> 00:59:14,636
Something's happened
to you, Steve.

902
00:59:16,054 --> 00:59:17,722
I'm grown up, Woz.

903
00:59:19,891 --> 00:59:23,144
No. No, you're not.

904
00:59:50,797 --> 00:59:52,882
And now, turning to
big news in business,

905
00:59:52,966 --> 00:59:55,802
Apple Incorporated is making
headlines once again.

906
00:59:55,885 --> 00:59:57,512
On Wall Street
the tech titan Apple

907
00:59:57,595 --> 01:00:00,098
went public this morning,
to incredible market interest,

908
01:00:00,181 --> 01:00:03,268
as four point six million
shares of its IPO

909
01:00:03,351 --> 01:00:05,395
were sold within an hour
of the opening bell.

910
01:00:05,728 --> 01:00:07,855
Wall Street executives
had forecast the big day

911
01:00:07,939 --> 01:00:09,440
for the growing
technology company,

912
01:00:09,524 --> 01:00:11,442
but experts now say Apple's day

913
01:00:11,526 --> 01:00:13,361
exceeded the market's
wildest expectations.

914
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,029
It was the most over...

915
01:00:24,455 --> 01:00:25,873
(INDISTINCT)

916
01:00:33,715 --> 01:00:35,466
Hey, hey. Here he is!

917
01:00:36,342 --> 01:00:38,720
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, terrific.

918
01:00:47,395 --> 01:00:49,022
Yeah, you did it.

919
01:00:49,397 --> 01:00:50,877
JOBS: Let's help
them move that stock.

920
01:00:51,065 --> 01:00:52,275
Hey, pal.

921
01:00:52,692 --> 01:00:54,235
Oh, hey, thank you.

922
01:00:56,738 --> 01:00:57,947
Business as usual, guys.

923
01:01:08,374 --> 01:01:09,876
There's work to
be done, people.

924
01:01:10,293 --> 01:01:13,796
Thank you.
I had some fun ideas.

925
01:01:14,756 --> 01:01:16,799
KOTTKE: This is it for me, Bill.
I'll see you when I see you.

926
01:01:16,883 --> 01:01:18,301
I'm gonna get out of here.

927
01:01:18,384 --> 01:01:19,594
I'll call you later.

928
01:01:19,677 --> 01:01:20,887
All right.

929
01:01:40,406 --> 01:01:43,826
Hi. Could you please tell
Mr. Markkula we're here. Thank you.

930
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:45,745
RECEPTIONIST:
Yes, sir, Mr. Rock.

931
01:01:51,959 --> 01:01:53,044
Gentlemen.

932
01:01:53,127 --> 01:01:54,796
Mike. Please.

933
01:01:56,964 --> 01:01:58,216
Have a seat.

934
01:02:00,343 --> 01:02:01,677
There's something we
need to talk about,

935
01:02:01,761 --> 01:02:04,639
and I don't think
you're gonna like it.

936
01:02:05,348 --> 01:02:06,891
It's Steve.

937
01:02:06,974 --> 01:02:09,185
He's hemorrhaging
the company's dollar

938
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:12,605
on fantasies that simply are not
possible with the Lisa computer.

939
01:02:13,773 --> 01:02:15,733
Yeah, but Steve's been
doing the impossible

940
01:02:15,817 --> 01:02:17,777
ever since this company
was in a garage.

941
01:02:18,194 --> 01:02:21,614
<i>ROCK: Mike, I love everything
Steve represents. You know that.</i>

942
01:02:21,864 --> 01:02:25,284
But he's like a kid in a candy
store, and we've given him the keys.

943
01:02:25,368 --> 01:02:28,830
(CHUCKLING) Yeah.
But, it's his candy store.

944
01:02:29,163 --> 01:02:31,541
You're never gonna see
a personal computer

945
01:02:31,874 --> 01:02:34,085
where the keyboard is attached
to the machine again.

946
01:02:34,168 --> 01:02:35,795
ROCK: Mike, it's a problem.

947
01:02:35,878 --> 01:02:39,549
The bigger problem is that
he is ridiculing IBM.

948
01:02:39,674 --> 01:02:43,636
Jobs took out a full page ad
in The Wall Street Journal

949
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:46,973
taunting the biggest computer
company on the planet.

950
01:02:47,515 --> 01:02:50,393
"Congratulations on your
first personal computer."

951
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:53,479
He's trying to start
a war with IB fucking M!

952
01:02:53,771 --> 01:02:55,231
I'm fully aware of the ad.

953
01:02:55,314 --> 01:02:56,649
Then do something about it!

954
01:02:56,732 --> 01:02:59,026
Listen, Arthur,
you know he's right.

955
01:02:59,152 --> 01:03:02,238
Three years ago IBM had no
interest in the personal computer

956
01:03:02,321 --> 01:03:03,614
and now look at 'em!

957
01:03:03,698 --> 01:03:05,992
They followed us.
Think about it.

958
01:03:06,159 --> 01:03:07,368
We have, Mike.

959
01:03:07,743 --> 01:03:09,996
And I'm sorry, but the
Board is unanimous.

960
01:03:10,538 --> 01:03:13,207
Steve will no longer be involved
in Lisa's development. Period.

961
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:17,712
MARKKULA: What is this, Arthur?
Some sort of power play?

962
01:03:18,212 --> 01:03:20,292
For 18 months now you've
offered nothing but support.

963
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,759
And now you want to try and
take Jobs off of his own team?

964
01:03:26,554 --> 01:03:29,015
I don't want any of this, Mike.

965
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:30,879
But you have to
try to look at it

966
01:03:30,892 --> 01:03:32,810
from the shareholder's
perspective.

967
01:03:32,894 --> 01:03:34,228
Steve is great.

968
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:36,856
He's great.
Yeah, he's great.

969
01:03:36,939 --> 01:03:38,399
But he's a time bomb.

970
01:03:39,233 --> 01:03:41,360
And it's our job
to diffuse him.

971
01:03:42,737 --> 01:03:44,030
So take care of it.

972
01:03:47,241 --> 01:03:49,452
I don't give a shit
what the Board thinks.

973
01:03:49,577 --> 01:03:52,955
It's the time you're taking. Your perfectionism.
It's, it's, it...

974
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,681
They're looking at
losses in the millions

975
01:03:54,749 --> 01:03:56,429
before this thing
even gets off the ground.

976
01:03:58,544 --> 01:04:01,464
They're not seeing
the big picture.

977
01:04:01,547 --> 01:04:04,091
That's right. The shareholders
don't see past their own shadows.

978
01:04:04,175 --> 01:04:05,968
They're only concerned
about the here and the now.

979
01:04:06,052 --> 01:04:07,803
And the Board has
got blinders on.

980
01:04:07,929 --> 01:04:08,971
If they could see you
they'd take them off,

981
01:04:09,096 --> 01:04:10,376
they'd see you
the way I see you.

982
01:04:10,389 --> 01:04:11,589
The way your employees see you.

983
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:13,601
Lisa is my project.

984
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,561
It's mine.

985
01:04:16,145 --> 01:04:18,814
And they're taking
it away from me?

986
01:04:22,401 --> 01:04:24,195
You're letting them
take it away from me.

987
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:26,697
(SCOFFS) Bullshit, Steve.
You know that's not true.

988
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:31,285
Shit.

989
01:04:40,419 --> 01:04:43,297
COMMERCIAL NARRATOR: There are more
Apple /ls teaching more subjects

990
01:04:43,381 --> 01:04:45,174
in more schools than
any other computer...

991
01:04:47,093 --> 01:04:50,304
Everything from alphabet
lessons for preschool,

992
01:04:50,388 --> 01:04:53,140
to science programs
for graduate school.

993
01:04:53,808 --> 01:04:55,810
So whatever Brian wants to be,

994
01:04:56,269 --> 01:04:57,562
an Apple personal computer

995
01:04:58,604 --> 01:05:00,398
can help him be it.

996
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:03,901
<i>The Apple II. There's no telling
how far it can take you.</i>

997
01:05:21,752 --> 01:05:23,170
Now that doesn't
make any sense.

998
01:05:23,254 --> 01:05:26,757
MAN 2: Well, you haven't seen as
much of murder as I have, Mr. Cross.

999
01:05:26,841 --> 01:05:30,303
I'd rather have a judge give me the
works than have to do it myself.

1000
01:05:30,678 --> 01:05:31,929
Right here in solitary.

1001
01:05:32,013 --> 01:05:33,097
MAN: So what?

1002
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:36,767
MAN 2: So you go right on punishing yourself.
You can't get away with it.

1003
01:05:41,314 --> 01:05:42,607
Hi, I'm Gabe Kaplan.

1004
01:05:42,815 --> 01:05:45,335
Take the Pepsi Challenge. Let your
taste decide. (PHONE RINGING)

1005
01:05:45,443 --> 01:05:47,945
Right, guys? Okay, now
why don't you tell me

1006
01:05:48,029 --> 01:05:50,531
which one you chose.
Pepsi Cola.

1007
01:05:51,282 --> 01:05:53,034
Yeah?
Hey, Steve. It's Mike.

1008
01:05:53,367 --> 01:05:54,452
Hey.

1009
01:05:54,535 --> 01:05:57,538
Hey. Um, I think I may have
found a project for you.

1010
01:05:57,705 --> 01:05:59,624
It's more of an R&D
outcast than anything,

1011
01:05:59,707 --> 01:06:02,001
but it's actually a project
you approved some time back.

1012
01:06:02,084 --> 01:06:03,878
Why don't you look into it?

1013
01:06:10,217 --> 01:06:12,011
So this is the Macintosh team.

1014
01:06:12,094 --> 01:06:13,220
Mmm-hmm.

1015
01:06:13,554 --> 01:06:15,097
Oh, Jesus.

1016
01:06:15,181 --> 01:06:17,058
Nope. It's just Steve.

1017
01:06:17,558 --> 01:06:19,435
It's really good
to see you, Steve.

1018
01:06:20,227 --> 01:06:23,648
Bill Atkinson. It's good to see
they got A players over here.

1019
01:06:23,731 --> 01:06:25,566
Mmm-hmm. Hey. Get up.

1020
01:06:30,613 --> 01:06:32,198
Hi, Steve Jobs.

1021
01:06:32,281 --> 01:06:33,324
What's your name?

1022
01:06:33,407 --> 01:06:34,992
Burr... (CLEARS THROAT)
Burrell Smith.

1023
01:06:35,076 --> 01:06:36,327
Burrell Smith.

1024
01:06:36,994 --> 01:06:38,037
Oh, sorry for the mess.

1025
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,665
We're just a bunch
of degenerates. So...

1026
01:06:40,831 --> 01:06:42,249
It's okay.
I like degenerates.

1027
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:43,376
Yeah.

1028
01:06:44,293 --> 01:06:45,336
Who's your project lead?

1029
01:06:45,628 --> 01:06:47,046
Uh, Jef Raskin...

1030
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:50,549
I don't know where he is.

1031
01:06:50,633 --> 01:06:52,134
JOBS: Jef Raskin.

1032
01:06:53,469 --> 01:06:57,431
Okay. I'll deal with that one.
I'll be taking over now.

1033
01:06:58,516 --> 01:07:03,479
Um... Sorry, taking over, like,
the entire Macintosh project?

1034
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:05,981
Yeah.
Awesome.

1035
01:07:07,858 --> 01:07:09,819
Where's your design team?

1036
01:07:12,613 --> 01:07:14,031
Team? I don't...

1037
01:07:15,408 --> 01:07:16,826
Show me your current build.

1038
01:07:19,787 --> 01:07:22,373
ATKINSON: Well, obviously ease
of use is a big feature here.

1039
01:07:22,456 --> 01:07:24,136
We're trying to develop
a simpler interface

1040
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:27,044
that's geared towards
the real layman end user.

1041
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:31,590
But, we're kind of struggling with
the interface, and, to be frank...

1042
01:07:31,674 --> 01:07:33,259
The results have been...

1043
01:07:33,676 --> 01:07:35,052
Shit.
Yeah.

1044
01:07:35,136 --> 01:07:36,497
JOBS: What's it got
under the hood?

1045
01:07:37,346 --> 01:07:38,597
Standard kick ass stuff.

1046
01:07:38,681 --> 01:07:39,890
Sixty-four K RAM...

1047
01:07:39,974 --> 01:07:42,852
Two fifty-six bitmap
display, Motorola 6809.

1048
01:07:43,602 --> 01:07:45,396
We're gonna run the 68000.

1049
01:07:45,479 --> 01:07:47,898
But dude,
that's Lisa's processor.

1050
01:07:47,982 --> 01:07:50,317
That's correct. Dude.

1051
01:07:51,235 --> 01:07:53,487
I don't care what the budget is.
Give me their processor.

1052
01:07:54,822 --> 01:07:56,115
Done.

1053
01:07:56,323 --> 01:07:57,908
ESPINOSA: Hey, Steve.

1054
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,368
How are you, man?

1055
01:08:02,121 --> 01:08:03,205
Chris, it has been a...

1056
01:08:03,289 --> 01:08:04,290
Yep.

1057
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:06,667
You're working on the Macintosh?
Yeah.

1058
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:08,961
Good.

1059
01:08:09,754 --> 01:08:11,505
Good, this is gonna be fun.

1060
01:08:18,554 --> 01:08:21,098
Okay. Let's go back to what
you were saying before.

1061
01:08:21,182 --> 01:08:24,101
This thing is for
the everyman. Right?

1062
01:08:24,435 --> 01:08:25,853
That's our end user.

1063
01:08:27,313 --> 01:08:29,106
It's the school teacher.

1064
01:08:29,190 --> 01:08:30,566
It's the garbage man.

1065
01:08:30,649 --> 01:08:35,070
It's the kid. It's some grandma
out in Nebraska. Right?

1066
01:08:35,571 --> 01:08:38,991
So we need to make
this thing simple.

1067
01:08:39,784 --> 01:08:42,369
It's gotta work like...

1068
01:08:43,871 --> 01:08:45,539
like an appliance.

1069
01:08:48,167 --> 01:08:49,460
SMITH: Hey, Jef.

1070
01:08:49,543 --> 01:08:50,795
Steve Jobs is here.

1071
01:08:51,796 --> 01:08:54,089
Since you weren't around...

1072
01:08:55,007 --> 01:08:58,969
Some of the project leads were
having a meeting with Motorola.

1073
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:01,263
Why exactly are you here?

1074
01:09:02,348 --> 01:09:05,392
I'm here to help
build the Macintosh.

1075
01:09:05,518 --> 01:09:09,063
Ah. I'm not sure that
that's practical for us.

1076
01:09:09,146 --> 01:09:12,066
We're actually trying
to avoid this project

1077
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:14,902
becoming another
over bloated disaster.

1078
01:09:20,115 --> 01:09:21,742
Okay, Jef.

1079
01:09:25,412 --> 01:09:26,956
You got my attention.

1080
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:30,918
Look, Steve.

1081
01:09:32,253 --> 01:09:34,755
You didn't want to be involved
back when we started this thing,

1082
01:09:34,839 --> 01:09:37,049
and that was fine by me.

1083
01:09:37,341 --> 01:09:39,677
I just wanted you
to cut the checks.

1084
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:42,346
Be involved,
just don't turn Macintosh

1085
01:09:42,429 --> 01:09:44,932
into a measure of
revenge for you.

1086
01:09:45,558 --> 01:09:48,727
Everyone knows about your
fallout with Team Lisa.

1087
01:09:48,811 --> 01:09:53,148
So trust me when I say,
we're doing fine.

1088
01:09:55,359 --> 01:09:57,152
Okay, Jef.

1089
01:09:59,947 --> 01:10:01,365
Let's get
a couple things straight.

1090
01:10:04,034 --> 01:10:06,662
We don't do fine.

1091
01:10:07,538 --> 01:10:09,999
And we don't accept things
the way that they are,

1092
01:10:10,082 --> 01:10:13,377
and we don't stop innovating.

1093
01:10:14,712 --> 01:10:17,047
Now, your machine lacks power.

1094
01:10:17,298 --> 01:10:19,800
And your little interface,
it needs work.

1095
01:10:19,884 --> 01:10:21,260
And I'm here to help with that.

1096
01:10:21,844 --> 01:10:25,514
Now, I'm not trying to take
Macintosh away from you.

1097
01:10:25,806 --> 01:10:28,684
I want you on this team.

1098
01:10:28,976 --> 01:10:32,980
But you can either get on board,
or you can get the fuck out.

1099
01:10:41,155 --> 01:10:44,450
Okay. Now, we've got a lot of work to do.
So, let's get to it.

1100
01:10:44,533 --> 01:10:45,993
Bill, you come with me.

1101
01:10:46,076 --> 01:10:47,745
Okay. Where are we going?

1102
01:10:47,828 --> 01:10:48,871
Recruiting.

1103
01:10:49,955 --> 01:10:51,123
Shit.

1104
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:55,628
Hey, Steve.
Hold these for a second.

1105
01:10:55,711 --> 01:10:57,171
Yeah.
Thanks.

1106
01:10:57,254 --> 01:10:59,548
What, what's going on?
What are you doing?

1107
01:11:00,591 --> 01:11:02,301
Steve? You're on the
Macintosh Team now.

1108
01:11:02,384 --> 01:11:06,263
What, Ste...
What's a Macintosh?

1109
01:11:09,058 --> 01:11:10,476
Andy Hertzfeld.

1110
01:11:10,559 --> 01:11:11,936
Are you good?

1111
01:11:12,019 --> 01:11:14,688
I only want good people
working on Macintosh,

1112
01:11:15,147 --> 01:11:16,899
and I'm not sure
if you're good enough.

1113
01:11:18,108 --> 01:11:19,109
Excuse me?

1114
01:11:19,193 --> 01:11:21,570
Bill Atkinson says
that you're good.

1115
01:11:22,029 --> 01:11:24,531
I... Yes.
I think I'm pretty good.

1116
01:11:24,657 --> 01:11:25,658
Are you creative?

1117
01:11:25,741 --> 01:11:26,867
I... I... I think so.

1118
01:11:26,951 --> 01:11:29,411
Welcome to the Macintosh Team.

1119
01:11:37,169 --> 01:11:38,629
I'm tired of saving
your ass, kid.

1120
01:11:38,712 --> 01:11:40,047
You love saving my ass.

1121
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:41,840
I want my own engineering team.

1122
01:11:41,924 --> 01:11:43,634
You can pick them yourself.

1123
01:11:44,093 --> 01:11:47,304
And I am done
working under the gun

1124
01:11:47,388 --> 01:11:50,557
of your ridiculous
deadline bullshit.

1125
01:11:50,724 --> 01:11:53,227
You might as well be asking
for a date with her.

1126
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,437
I want that, too. (LAUGHS)

1127
01:11:55,521 --> 01:11:56,814
Done.

1128
01:11:56,897 --> 01:11:58,399
Serious, Steve.

1129
01:12:00,651 --> 01:12:03,237
So what is this, Steve? Some
sort of performance review?

1130
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:04,560
How are things
going on the IIE?

1131
01:12:04,905 --> 01:12:07,324
Things are great.
Really great.

1132
01:12:07,408 --> 01:12:08,729
You're bored to death,
aren't you?

1133
01:12:08,742 --> 01:12:10,160
Yes. Yes I am.

1134
01:12:13,247 --> 01:12:14,581
You want to come work
with me on the Mac Team?

1135
01:12:14,665 --> 01:12:17,418
You're trying to recruit me
for the Mac Team, aren't you?

1136
01:12:17,501 --> 01:12:19,003
Okay, I'm in.

1137
01:12:24,633 --> 01:12:27,511
You've gotta have a problem
that you want to solve.

1138
01:12:27,594 --> 01:12:29,263
A wrong that you want to right.

1139
01:12:29,388 --> 01:12:31,629
And it's gotta be something
that you're passionate about,

1140
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:34,601
because otherwise you won't have the
perseverance to see it through.

1141
01:12:34,768 --> 01:12:38,022
I don't ever want to hear you tell
me that you can't make it faster.

1142
01:12:38,105 --> 01:12:40,733
I mean, millions of people
are gonna buy this machine.

1143
01:12:40,816 --> 01:12:42,943
And we can't look
at the competition

1144
01:12:43,027 --> 01:12:45,029
and say we're
gonna do it better.

1145
01:12:45,112 --> 01:12:48,741
We have to look at the competition and
say we're gonna do it differently.

1146
01:12:49,116 --> 01:12:53,620
We have an opportunity to build
a revolutionary machine.

1147
01:12:53,912 --> 01:12:56,623
And in your life you only
get to do so many things.

1148
01:12:56,790 --> 01:13:00,252
Right now we've
chosen to do this.

1149
01:13:00,461 --> 01:13:02,504
So let's make it great.

1150
01:13:30,324 --> 01:13:31,492
It's great.

1151
01:13:34,703 --> 01:13:36,622
No. It's not.

1152
01:13:37,873 --> 01:13:39,666
It's insanely great.

1153
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:40,959
(LAUGHS)

1154
01:13:47,508 --> 01:13:49,551
We should try to get more
memory into it if we can.

1155
01:13:51,053 --> 01:13:52,429
We can still hit the timeline.

1156
01:13:53,972 --> 01:13:55,224
Take a look at it.

1157
01:13:56,350 --> 01:13:59,144
This little Macintosh side project
has gotten out of hand, Steve.

1158
01:13:59,228 --> 01:14:00,729
Way beyond the pale.

1159
01:14:01,438 --> 01:14:04,900
First you created a $10,000
monstrosity with Lisa,

1160
01:14:04,983 --> 01:14:06,819
and now you've poured millions

1161
01:14:06,902 --> 01:14:08,743
into what was supposed
to be a minor diversion.

1162
01:14:09,446 --> 01:14:11,281
You've missed
multiple ship dates,

1163
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:14,576
and meanwhile, IBM is
just purring along.

1164
01:14:15,077 --> 01:14:16,328
Steve...

1165
01:14:16,411 --> 01:14:19,081
People don't use computers
the way you think they do.

1166
01:14:19,498 --> 01:14:22,167
How are we even supposed
to market the Macintosh?

1167
01:14:22,543 --> 01:14:23,794
We don't.

1168
01:14:25,295 --> 01:14:28,382
You give me five candidates for CEO.
You're gonna let me choose.

1169
01:14:28,465 --> 01:14:30,342
I say we choose someone
with a marketing background

1170
01:14:30,425 --> 01:14:32,136
to help us sell
what's never been sold.

1171
01:14:32,511 --> 01:14:35,848
Now, while I would like
to run my own company,

1172
01:14:35,931 --> 01:14:40,394
Mike has helped me understand
that you don't think I'm ready.

1173
01:14:41,103 --> 01:14:42,646
Yes, because you're not.

1174
01:14:42,729 --> 01:14:43,772
Okay.

1175
01:14:44,273 --> 01:14:45,649
I want John Sculley.

1176
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:47,568
John Sculley?

1177
01:14:47,651 --> 01:14:49,194
President of Pepsi Cola.

1178
01:14:49,278 --> 01:14:50,404
The Pepsi Challenge guy.

1179
01:14:50,612 --> 01:14:53,407
He's smart,
he's a marketing genius

1180
01:14:53,907 --> 01:14:55,576
and he'll do whatever
it takes to succeed.

1181
01:14:55,909 --> 01:14:57,369
Steve, Sculley is a tough get.

1182
01:14:57,828 --> 01:14:59,204
Maybe the toughest on our list.

1183
01:14:59,746 --> 01:15:02,124
What the hell makes you
think you can get him?

1184
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:05,419
Why would he ever leave Pepsi?

1185
01:15:08,297 --> 01:15:11,592
Nobody remembers the world's
best soda salesman.

(INDISTINCT)

01:15:28,609 --> 01:15:30,277
I need somebody I can trust.

1188
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:35,782
SCULLEY: You can
make a great product.

1189
01:15:37,075 --> 01:15:38,493
But you have to convince people

1190
01:15:38,577 --> 01:15:41,205
that what you're
selling is greater.

1191
01:15:41,663 --> 01:15:45,334
We're not selling computers.
We're selling what they can do

1192
01:15:46,001 --> 01:15:47,628
with a computer.

1193
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:50,005
A tool for the mind.

1194
01:15:51,632 --> 01:15:54,301
And that, ladies and gentlemen,

1195
01:15:55,010 --> 01:15:56,762
is limitless.

1196
01:15:57,429 --> 01:15:59,389
Because people will
never stop believing

1197
01:15:59,473 --> 01:16:01,433
that they could get
more out of something,

1198
01:16:02,142 --> 01:16:05,979
whether it be their jobs,
their marriage, their money,

1199
01:16:06,146 --> 01:16:07,940
their lives.

1200
01:16:08,023 --> 01:16:10,275
That's what you have
to do with the Mac.

1201
01:16:10,817 --> 01:16:12,986
It's the belief
in the limitless.

1202
01:16:13,946 --> 01:16:15,656
The impossible.

1203
01:16:15,864 --> 01:16:19,493
That no matter what you
dream, you can do it.

1204
01:16:20,369 --> 01:16:22,204
And Mac will
help you get there.

1205
01:16:23,413 --> 01:16:26,375
A few months ago, when Steve
was visiting me in Manhattan,

1206
01:16:26,458 --> 01:16:29,544
he asked me a very important question.
He said,

1207
01:16:31,004 --> 01:16:33,324
"Do you want to sell sugar water
for the rest of your life,

1208
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:37,427
"or come with me,
and change the world?"

It appears IBM wants it all.

1214
01:17:18,010 --> 01:17:20,595
Apple is perceived
to be the only hope

1215
01:17:20,679 --> 01:17:23,223
to offer IBM
a run for its money.

1265
01:20:16,897 --> 01:20:18,356
We can't have it both ways.

1266
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,984
I mean, you insisted on the
most expensive hardware.

1267
01:20:21,067 --> 01:20:22,652
The Mac was originally
much cheaper.

1268
01:20:22,736 --> 01:20:25,655
Jef Raskin
designed a $1,000 box.

1269
01:20:25,739 --> 01:20:27,032
I made it great.

1270
01:20:27,115 --> 01:20:28,992
If you want the company
to remain profitable...

1271
01:20:29,075 --> 01:20:30,577
Whose idea was this?

1272
01:20:35,916 --> 01:20:37,292
It's a group decision.

1273
01:20:38,585 --> 01:20:40,462
Whose idea was this?

1274
01:20:43,131 --> 01:20:47,511
It was mine. Not Michael's,
not the Board. It was me.

1275
01:20:50,305 --> 01:20:54,392
We don't do this, John.
IBM does this shit.

1276
01:20:54,476 --> 01:20:56,394
SCULLEY: Steve...
Not Apple. Not me.

1277
01:20:56,478 --> 01:20:58,146
Look, don't make me
the villain because

1278
01:20:58,230 --> 01:21:00,565
I'm looking out for our
company's best interests.

1279
01:21:00,649 --> 01:21:01,900
Steve.

1280
01:21:04,277 --> 01:21:06,196
Some things have to change.

1281
01:21:09,533 --> 01:21:12,077
If you keep heading
down this path,

1282
01:21:12,744 --> 01:21:14,621
I will not be able
to protect you.

1283
01:21:16,915 --> 01:21:18,625
They got to you.

1284
01:21:25,298 --> 01:21:26,424
They?

1285
01:21:52,867 --> 01:21:54,244
How'd you get this?

1286
01:21:54,828 --> 01:21:59,416
Arrived yesterday. It's pre-beta,
obviously, but it's all...

1287
01:21:59,499 --> 01:22:01,376
It's a blatant rip-off.

1288
01:22:11,052 --> 01:22:13,471
Get me Bill Gates on the phone.

1289
01:22:13,930 --> 01:22:17,934
Let me make this
perfectly clear, Bill.

1290
01:22:18,476 --> 01:22:23,440
So that when I'm finished, you
can still see through those

1291
01:22:23,523 --> 01:22:28,194
thick pretentious glasses, you
psychopathic, unimaginative criminal.

1292
01:22:31,281 --> 01:22:37,787
You stole my software,
and I can prove it in court.

1293
01:22:38,705 --> 01:22:43,543
And I'm gonna sue you for every
cent that you have ever made.

1294
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:48,131
And I will make it my life's mission
to see to it that you never,

1295
01:22:48,590 --> 01:22:49,674
never,

1296
01:22:49,758 --> 01:22:53,720
ever make another dollar that
I don't first take 90 cents.

1297
01:22:56,931 --> 01:23:00,352
I can only assume that you
are all as irate as I am,

1298
01:23:00,435 --> 01:23:03,605
and you're simply
too dumbfounded to speak.

1299
01:23:03,897 --> 01:23:06,399
Mr. Jobs promised
us a million units.

1300
01:23:06,566 --> 01:23:08,234
We have yet to reach
a quarter of that.

1301
01:23:08,485 --> 01:23:10,111
Something has to change.

1302
01:23:10,403 --> 01:23:13,531
With two failed projects,
overextended R&Ds,

1303
01:23:13,615 --> 01:23:14,991
and that Microsoft fiasco,

1304
01:23:15,283 --> 01:23:18,453
we're about to experience the first
quarterly loss in company history.

1305
01:23:18,787 --> 01:23:20,747
IBM beat us to market
by two years

1306
01:23:20,830 --> 01:23:23,124
with a better product
and better sales.

1307
01:23:23,249 --> 01:23:26,252
The Macintosh is not even a toy.
It's a joke.

1308
01:23:26,753 --> 01:23:29,255
IBM has now moved
on to mini decks.

1309
01:23:29,964 --> 01:23:31,424
And so should we.

1310
01:23:33,259 --> 01:23:35,470
What are you
getting at, Arthur?

1311
01:23:36,304 --> 01:23:39,057
Gentlemen, I believe
it's time to reconsider

1312
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:41,851
the viability of
the personal computer.

1313
01:23:45,814 --> 01:23:47,774
Steve, anything to say?

1314
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:53,530
What would you
have me say, Arthur?

1315
01:23:55,115 --> 01:23:56,449
You raised our price.

1316
01:23:57,575 --> 01:23:58,952
Don't put that on me.

1317
01:23:59,035 --> 01:24:02,747
The problem is not the price, Steve.
It's your product.

1318
01:24:03,123 --> 01:24:04,541
You over-hyped the Mac.

1319
01:24:04,708 --> 01:24:08,670
You told people to wait. You sold
the future of the Macintosh.

1320
01:24:09,337 --> 01:24:11,506
And as a result we lost
two years of sales.

1321
01:24:11,589 --> 01:24:12,924
It's not my fault.

1322
01:24:13,007 --> 01:24:14,968
Well, it sure as shit
is somebody's fault.

1323
01:24:15,135 --> 01:24:16,803
Well, I'm not
receiving any support.

1324
01:24:17,846 --> 01:24:19,723
You're stripping
me of my resources,

1325
01:24:19,806 --> 01:24:21,474
and dumping millions
into the Apple ll.

1326
01:24:21,558 --> 01:24:24,269
Do you know why we keep dumping
millions into the Apple ll?

1327
01:24:24,352 --> 01:24:29,315
Because it sells. It's 70% of our revenue.
How's the Mac doing?

1328
01:24:29,399 --> 01:24:32,110
I made my opinion
perfectly clear.

1329
01:24:32,193 --> 01:24:35,822
If you want to keep sucking on the
tailpipe of IBM, then I can't stop you.

1330
01:24:36,030 --> 01:24:39,784
But I will not take the blame for
the failures of some court jester.

1331
01:24:40,535 --> 01:24:41,745
All right,
this is crazy, Steve...

1332
01:24:41,828 --> 01:24:44,664
No. No, no. To whom are
you referring, Steve?

1333
01:24:45,331 --> 01:24:46,916
JOBS: I don't know, Arthur.

1334
01:24:47,041 --> 01:24:48,585
You tell me.

1335
01:24:53,673 --> 01:24:55,842
John, you're awfully quiet.

1336
01:24:58,928 --> 01:25:00,472
Yeah. I'm sorry.

1337
01:25:02,599 --> 01:25:04,517
I guess I'm just
at a loss for words.

1338
01:25:05,727 --> 01:25:08,897
Head of marketing.
Pepsi genius.

1339
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:10,857
Loss for words.

1340
01:25:11,608 --> 01:25:14,861
It's him. Not the Mac.

1341
01:25:18,031 --> 01:25:19,657
JOBS: But the cost
of that process...

1342
01:25:24,704 --> 01:25:25,872
(MUMBLING)

1343
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:30,418
$10,000 price tag.
That price tag...

1344
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:40,220
Goes against him,
and not against Mac.

1345
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:42,764
WOZNIAK:
It's ironic, isn't it?

1346
01:25:44,974 --> 01:25:48,561
You chose Dylan, I chose,
I chose The Beatles.

1347
01:25:48,645 --> 01:25:50,522
Seems so backward now.

1348
01:25:50,605 --> 01:25:51,731
Woz.

1349
01:25:52,482 --> 01:25:54,150
What are you doing here?

1350
01:25:55,777 --> 01:25:57,487
Good to see you, too, Steve.

1351
01:25:57,570 --> 01:26:00,073
I'm... I'm a little bit busy.

1352
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:02,826
Just, do you mind
if we talk later?

1353
01:26:02,909 --> 01:26:05,954
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. This'll
only take a minute.

1354
01:26:07,705 --> 01:26:08,915
I, uh...

1355
01:26:09,624 --> 01:26:11,459
I'm leaving, Steve.

1356
01:26:12,752 --> 01:26:13,962
Okay.

1357
01:26:15,088 --> 01:26:16,923
No. No, Steve.

1358
01:26:18,758 --> 01:26:20,218
I'm leaving Apple.

1359
01:26:22,053 --> 01:26:25,056
For good. Actually,
I already did. I just...

1360
01:26:25,765 --> 01:26:28,685
I thought I should come
back and tell you first.

1361
01:26:29,561 --> 01:26:30,854
Why?

1362
01:26:33,481 --> 01:26:34,774
(SIGHS)

1363
01:26:34,858 --> 01:26:38,611
We both knew this was coming
for some time. I don't even...

1364
01:26:38,695 --> 01:26:41,197
I don't even remember
the last time we talked.

1365
01:26:43,533 --> 01:26:45,034
What do you want from me, then?

1366
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:49,289
Not everyone has
an agenda, Steve.

1367
01:26:51,291 --> 01:26:52,584
Right.

1368
01:26:56,004 --> 01:26:59,465
You know, I can still remember
when we were just kids,

1369
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:02,093
back in your dad's garage.

1370
01:27:04,304 --> 01:27:05,555
And we just wanted to

1371
01:27:05,638 --> 01:27:09,267
create cool toys for people like us.
You remember that?

1372
01:27:10,643 --> 01:27:11,853
Yeah.

1373
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:15,315
Now it's not about
people anymore for you.

1374
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:17,692
No, it's about the product.

1375
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:20,987
Worst of all, it's...

1376
01:27:22,739 --> 01:27:23,990
It's about yourself.

1377
01:27:25,617 --> 01:27:29,245
You're the beginning and end
of your own world, Steve.

1378
01:27:31,164 --> 01:27:35,585
And it's so small. So sad.

1379
01:27:37,962 --> 01:27:41,382
And it's... it's
gotta be lonely.

1380
01:27:43,176 --> 01:27:45,511
And I know you're gonna say

1381
01:27:46,179 --> 01:27:48,514
that the product and the person

1382
01:27:48,598 --> 01:27:50,850
need to be connected
and all that,

1383
01:27:50,934 --> 01:27:54,812
but it will never be
what you think it will.

1384
01:27:56,230 --> 01:27:58,024
It just won't.

1385
01:27:59,025 --> 01:28:01,819
No, not, not for
a long time at least.

1386
01:28:03,321 --> 01:28:07,075
I don't know what you think
is going on, Steve, but I do.

1387
01:28:07,575 --> 01:28:09,994
And it doesn't
end well for you.

1388
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:14,582
And I'm not...

1389
01:28:15,917 --> 01:28:18,503
I'm not sticking
around to watch.

1390
01:28:22,298 --> 01:28:24,300
It's been a journey.

1391
01:28:28,471 --> 01:28:30,723
And for the record,

1392
01:28:34,769 --> 01:28:36,521
I love what we did.

Hi. You've reached John Sculley.
Please leave a message.

Hey, John. It's Steve.

We're still partners,

01:29:58,478 --> 01:30:01,397
You just give me a call back?
That'd be great. Um...

1403
01:30:13,284 --> 01:30:15,286
Hey, Mike. It's Steve.

1404
01:30:17,997 --> 01:30:20,374
Would you give me a call back?

1405
01:30:22,168 --> 01:30:23,503
Please?

ROCK: John, you have
to take control now.

1407
01:30:34,180 --> 01:30:36,974
Do you have any idea how close
our shareholders are to a panic?

1408
01:30:37,058 --> 01:30:39,519
The implications
of your inaction?

1409
01:30:40,561 --> 01:30:43,856
Forget your job, the entire
company is at stake here.

1410
01:30:43,981 --> 01:30:45,399
This could ruin everyone.

1411
01:30:45,650 --> 01:30:47,985
SCULLEY: I know, Arthur, but I still
think that we can salvage this.

1412
01:30:48,069 --> 01:30:50,196

01:31:03,334 --> 01:31:05,586
I could ask you
the same question.

01:31:07,004 --> 01:31:08,673
ROCK: This is good.

Steve, why don't you join us this time?
Have a seat.

1423

This time?

01:31:13,678 --> 01:31:15,888
Steve, have a seat.

01:31:27,608 --> 01:31:29,110
Arthur, I don't want to. Yes.

1427

You do. Say it.

1428

Tell him what you've told me.

1429
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:54,927
I find it increasingly
difficult to do my job

1430
01:31:56,929 --> 01:31:59,932
when the greatest
obstacle in my path

casts a looming shadow over
everything I try to do.

1434

You are your own worst enemy.

I'm CEO of Apple Computer.

Hiring you

1440
01:32:54,904 --> 01:32:59,492
was the worst mistake
I have ever made.

1441

have to be this way.

1446

He has the nerve to tell me
we should have used the 512.

1447
01:33:21,514 --> 01:33:22,835
We told them that
it needed a 512.

1448
01:33:22,848 --> 01:33:24,767
We said not to use the 128.

And then what happens,
you know?

1455
01:33:38,197 --> 01:33:39,615
He's the CEO of
the company now.

Well, for now.

So I didn't come to join your revolution.
I came to warn you.

He wants to make
absolutely sure

1465
01:34:16,235 --> 01:34:18,070
you're nothing more
than a figurehead.

No team.

1468
01:34:29,749 --> 01:34:34,962
I remember thinking when we first
met, um, that you were remarkable.

1469
01:34:36,422 --> 01:34:38,841
You wanted to do
something truly great.

1470
01:34:40,176 --> 01:34:41,802
And I did, too.

1471

I still do.

1472
01:34:45,598 --> 01:34:49,810
Raise the white flag. Concede to Sculley.
I'm begging you.

No.

You can't win this one.

Whose side are you on, Mike?

1476
01:34:56,734 --> 01:34:58,444
Because there are sides now.

or you're against me.

Yes, Steve. I'm with you.

Okay.

1481

Sculley.

1578
01:45:45,090 --> 01:45:46,842
It's 11:00 a.m.
on a Monday.

1579
01:45:47,092 --> 01:45:48,135
JOBS: No.

1580
01:45:48,677 --> 01:45:52,931
Why are you
still here at Apple?

1581
01:45:53,807 --> 01:45:56,143
This isn't the company I built.

1582
01:45:56,226 --> 01:45:59,062
There's no taste, no style.

1583
01:46:00,022 --> 01:46:01,732
No design.

1584
01:46:01,940 --> 01:46:06,111
So unless they're shackling
you here, why do you stay?

1585
01:46:09,865 --> 01:46:14,202
Well, sir, I guess I would
say there are still

1586
01:46:14,286 --> 01:46:16,329
those of us that believe
in what Apple stood for.

1587
01:46:18,248 --> 01:46:19,624
What you stood for.

1588
01:46:20,625 --> 01:46:22,502
What do you think I stood for?

1589
01:46:24,296 --> 01:46:25,756
I think...

1590
01:46:28,425 --> 01:46:31,720
I think you believe
that the computer,

1591
01:46:31,803 --> 01:46:35,098
or the Walkman,
or whatever it may be,

1592
01:46:35,766 --> 01:46:38,518
should be a natural extension
of the individual.

1593
01:46:39,478 --> 01:46:41,480
And it's that mission,

1594
01:46:41,730 --> 01:46:47,110
that devotion to quality,
and ideals, and heart...

1595
01:46:49,321 --> 01:46:53,658
That's what keeps us here.
That we might do it once more.

1596
01:46:58,497 --> 01:46:59,623
(MUMBLES)

1597
01:47:24,481 --> 01:47:26,858
Okay. Whatever
you're working on,

1598
01:47:27,526 --> 01:47:29,277
the rest of the day
I want you to forget it.

1599
01:47:31,321 --> 01:47:34,282
I want everyone to
design something new.

1600
01:47:34,908 --> 01:47:36,993
I don't care what it is, I
don't care if it's technology,

1601
01:47:37,077 --> 01:47:39,621
just create something.

1602
01:47:41,706 --> 01:47:43,291
Something useful.

1603
01:47:44,292 --> 01:47:45,710
Something you care about.

1604
01:47:54,636 --> 01:47:55,720
Steve.

1605
01:47:58,348 --> 01:48:00,225
We're glad you're back.

1606
01:48:01,893 --> 01:48:03,395
I'm not back.

1607
01:48:07,774 --> 01:48:08,984
Yet.

1608
01:48:14,156 --> 01:48:15,657

Junk.

1614
01:48:32,883 --> 01:48:34,968
Steve, you met
our Chairman, Ed Woolard.

1615
01:48:35,302 --> 01:48:37,012
Steve.
Hi.

1616
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:41,808
WOOLARD: Look, um...

1617
01:48:41,975 --> 01:48:44,895
I know all about the bad
blood you must taste.

1618
01:48:44,978 --> 01:48:50,317
And I understand your hesitation to trust me.
But I just want you to know

1619
01:48:51,109 --> 01:48:54,529
lam not Arthur Rock.
I'm your friend.

1620
01:48:56,573 --> 01:48:57,657
Okay.

1621
01:48:59,201 --> 01:49:01,786
So, can we take
a minute to talk?

1622
01:49:02,495 --> 01:49:03,496
Apparently.

1623
01:49:03,705 --> 01:49:04,748
Today's paper.

1624
01:49:05,415 --> 01:49:07,542
I'm sure you've seen the news.

1625
01:49:08,376 --> 01:49:10,629
I'm sorry, Ed, you're gonna
have to be more specific.

1626
01:49:11,046 --> 01:49:15,383
Our shares dropped
7.5% overnight.

1627
01:49:16,009 --> 01:49:17,969
It's the lowest
it's been in 10 years.

1628
01:49:18,220 --> 01:49:20,805
Last week
an unidentified investor

1629
01:49:21,389 --> 01:49:23,642
dropped one point five
million shares.

1630
01:49:25,018 --> 01:49:27,938
Put a real scare into
the marketplace, Steve.

1631
01:49:28,688 --> 01:49:31,733
One point five
million shares? Wow.

1632
01:49:33,902 --> 01:49:36,821
I guess the stockholders
must be getting restless.

1633
01:49:38,782 --> 01:49:40,367
MARKKULA: We want
you here, Steve.

1634
01:49:40,825 --> 01:49:43,286
I'm here.
As a consultant.

1635
01:49:43,787 --> 01:49:45,288
As CEO.

1636
01:49:47,457 --> 01:49:48,708
CEO?
Yeah.

1637
01:49:48,792 --> 01:49:50,126
At least in the interim.

1638
01:49:51,294 --> 01:49:52,462
And Gil?

1639
01:49:52,545 --> 01:49:54,506
MARKKULA: Yeah, well,
Gil's halfway out the door.

1640
01:49:54,881 --> 01:49:57,133
He has to see
the writing on the wall.

1641
01:49:57,217 --> 01:49:59,427
At least if he's not
too proud to admit it.

1642
01:49:59,511 --> 01:50:03,598
Oh, he's going to try to force you
out, and make a case against you.

1643
01:50:03,682 --> 01:50:05,725
Where have I seen this before?

1644
01:50:06,393 --> 01:50:08,478
Gil's on the ledge. He
doesn't have a play here.

1645
01:50:08,561 --> 01:50:11,064
All we need is
a little push from you.

1646
01:50:11,398 --> 01:50:14,025
If you want to get back what
you lost, this is the time.

1647
01:50:16,403 --> 01:50:20,156
I never lost it.
It was stolen from me.

1648
01:50:27,414 --> 01:50:31,209
There's no sex left in computers.
No curves.

1649
01:50:32,335 --> 01:50:35,463
Now, if computers are
for art, and beauty,

1650
01:50:35,547 --> 01:50:38,758
and global interconnectivity,
why are they so ugly?

1651
01:50:39,801 --> 01:50:43,138
You know, it should be artful.
But no one cares.

1652
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:48,643
The world may mistakenly see
computers only in black and white,

1653
01:50:49,644 --> 01:50:53,565
but we live, and we dream
and we paint in color.

1654
01:50:55,233 --> 01:50:57,694
And we think
the computer should, too.

1655
01:51:04,284 --> 01:51:05,535
What do you think?

1656
01:51:10,999 --> 01:51:15,086
Jony, I always want you
to be honest with me.

1657
01:51:17,922 --> 01:51:19,382
No matter what.

1658
01:51:20,258 --> 01:51:22,469
Just be brutally honest.

1659
01:51:24,971 --> 01:51:26,264
Understand?

1660
01:51:26,681 --> 01:51:28,224
Understand.

1661
01:51:30,769 --> 01:51:32,562
What do you think?

1662
01:51:34,439 --> 01:51:36,816
I think, I think the blue,

1663
01:51:39,527 --> 01:51:40,695
it's not quite right.

1664
01:51:43,114 --> 01:51:46,826
Here's a dopey idea. What if
we put the speakers inside?

1665
01:51:49,704 --> 01:51:51,915
Yeah, Steve,
Gil Amelio and the board

1666
01:51:51,998 --> 01:51:54,167
are not gonna allow that.
No way.

1667
01:51:54,793 --> 01:51:56,169
(CHUCKING)

1668
01:51:57,295 --> 01:51:59,923
We're not gonna
ask for permission.

1669
01:52:01,341 --> 01:52:03,301
Steve's done an admirable
job assisting me

1670
01:52:03,385 --> 01:52:06,054
as an advisor during
this, this period.

1671
01:52:06,304 --> 01:52:11,101
And while I commend his
actions, and his initiatives,

1672
01:52:11,601 --> 01:52:14,896
I believe it's now in our
best interest to move on,

1673
01:52:15,063 --> 01:52:18,817
and relieve Steve of his
advisory role in this company.

1674
01:52:20,402 --> 01:52:21,403
I agree, Gil.

1675
01:52:22,987 --> 01:52:24,072
You do?

1676
01:52:24,155 --> 01:52:27,992
I do think it's time Steve step
out of his current role, yes.

1677
01:52:29,119 --> 01:52:30,120
Steve?

1678
01:52:30,787 --> 01:52:31,788
Thank you, Ed.

1679
01:52:33,456 --> 01:52:37,585
I'd like to present the Board my
vision for the future of Apple.

1680
01:52:38,837 --> 01:52:41,131
We're not Microsoft or Dell.

1681
01:52:41,673 --> 01:52:44,342
So we need to stop
trying to be that.

1682
01:52:46,177 --> 01:52:51,391
We need to go back to who we
are, and what we do best,

1683
01:52:51,474 --> 01:52:53,935
and throw away everything else.

1684
01:52:54,394 --> 01:52:55,515
Here's how we're gonna do it.

1685
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:57,313
We're gonna build
a new line of computers

1686
01:52:57,397 --> 01:52:59,190
for the home,
and for the office.

1687
01:53:00,024 --> 01:53:03,027
We're gonna build a new operating
system on the backbone of NEXT.

1688
01:53:04,446 --> 01:53:06,739
The next generation
of Macintosh.

1689
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:10,034
And we're gonna kill
every other project.

1690
01:53:10,994 --> 01:53:12,120
Everything.

1691
01:53:12,203 --> 01:53:15,790
This company will not
make shit anymore.

1692
01:53:16,708 --> 01:53:19,085
We're also gonna double down
on the advertising budget.

1693
01:53:19,169 --> 01:53:22,672
Chiat Day will be the only
advertising agency we use.

1694
01:53:22,839 --> 01:53:24,799
Just like back in the old days.

1695
01:53:25,550 --> 01:53:26,759
In short,

1696
01:53:28,052 --> 01:53:29,929
we're gonna make
Apple cool again.

1697
01:53:31,306 --> 01:53:33,433
But I will not be
able to move forward

1698
01:53:34,559 --> 01:53:39,022
without the Board's permission to
operate under complete autonomy.

1699
01:53:39,856 --> 01:53:43,693
I'll be made a full voting member
of the Board. And lastly...

1700
01:53:46,488 --> 01:53:48,072
Interim CEO.

1701
01:53:51,075 --> 01:53:52,452
Now, hold on.

1702
01:53:53,828 --> 01:53:56,831
I'm the CEO, and this is...

1703
01:53:58,875 --> 01:54:01,169
Look, you put me
in this position.

1704
01:54:01,628 --> 01:54:06,007
Apple is like a ship with a hole in
the bottom, and it's leaking water.

1705
01:54:06,090 --> 01:54:08,051
And it's my job
to make sure that

1706
01:54:08,134 --> 01:54:10,220
we point the ship
in the right direction.

1707
01:54:10,303 --> 01:54:12,972
So why don't you
let me do my job?

1708
01:54:13,431 --> 01:54:15,683
All right, let's
put this to a vote.

1709
01:54:17,060 --> 01:54:18,561
Those in favor?

1710
01:54:26,569 --> 01:54:28,196
What the hell?

1711
01:54:29,364 --> 01:54:30,365
Ed?

1712
01:54:32,575 --> 01:54:33,576
Mike?

1713
01:54:34,202 --> 01:54:37,163
Sorry, Gil.
Nothing personal.

1714
01:54:46,923 --> 01:54:49,717
JOBS: When you grow up,
you tend to get told

1715
01:54:49,801 --> 01:54:52,595
the world is
the way that it is,

1716
01:54:52,971 --> 01:54:55,848
your life is just to live
your life inside the world

1717
01:54:56,432 --> 01:54:59,477
and try not to bash
into the walls too much.

1718
01:54:59,686 --> 01:55:01,896
But that's a very limited life.

1719
01:55:02,272 --> 01:55:04,190
Life can be much broader,

1720
01:55:04,274 --> 01:55:07,235
once you discover one simple fact.
(INAUDIBLE)

1721
01:55:08,111 --> 01:55:10,572
And that is that
everything around you

1722
01:55:10,863 --> 01:55:12,365
that you call life

1723
01:55:12,699 --> 01:55:15,868
was made up by people that
are no smarter than you.

1724
01:55:16,452 --> 01:55:19,414
And you can change it.
You can influence it.

1725
01:55:19,497 --> 01:55:23,084
You can build your own things,
that other people can use.

1726
01:55:23,167 --> 01:55:26,462
It's to shake off
this erroneous notion

1727
01:55:26,546 --> 01:55:27,964
that life is just there,

1728
01:55:28,047 --> 01:55:30,717
and you're just gonna live
in it, versus embrace it.

1729
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:34,470
Change it. Improve it.
Make your mark upon it.

1730
01:55:34,554 --> 01:55:38,891
And once you learn that, you'll
never be the same again.

1731
01:55:40,727 --> 01:55:42,604
But in our cash position...

1732
01:55:42,687 --> 01:55:44,022
MARKKULA: Mr. CEO.

1733
01:55:44,772 --> 01:55:45,857
JOBS: Mike.

1734
01:55:45,940 --> 01:55:48,026
You wanted to talk to me?

1735
01:55:48,151 --> 01:55:50,445
Welcome. Please.
Have a seat.

1736
01:55:50,987 --> 01:55:52,780
Ed. Hey, Gareth.

1737
01:55:53,239 --> 01:55:54,240
Mike.

1738
01:55:58,786 --> 01:55:59,912
What's this?

1739
01:56:00,538 --> 01:56:01,664
It's an opportunity.

1740
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,461
I haven't seen Bernard
around for a few days.

1741
01:56:06,544 --> 01:56:08,755
Where's Katherine, Delano?

1742
01:56:08,921 --> 01:56:12,300
Mr. Lewis and Mrs. Hudson made
a difficult decision easier

1743
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:15,219
by agreeing to step
down from the Board.

1744
01:56:15,511 --> 01:56:16,512
Really?

1745
01:56:16,596 --> 01:56:20,767
They both agreed to accept incredibly
generous golden parachutes.

1746
01:56:21,392 --> 01:56:24,646
The same opportunity is
detailed inside that envelope.

1747
01:56:25,521 --> 01:56:27,398
So you're forcing us out?

1748
01:56:27,815 --> 01:56:28,900
With good reason.

1749
01:56:28,983 --> 01:56:30,109
And what's that?

1750
01:56:30,193 --> 01:56:31,819
The current arrangement is

1751
01:56:33,279 --> 01:56:34,322
inhibiting.

1752
01:56:35,406 --> 01:56:37,992
I can't hold everyone's hand
while we cross the street, Mike.

1753
01:56:38,076 --> 01:56:40,870
And so your next big move
is to eradicate your Board?

1754
01:56:40,953 --> 01:56:42,455
And you think you
can just do that?

1755
01:56:42,538 --> 01:56:46,334
I'm sorry, Mike.
But it's time.

1756
01:56:47,251 --> 01:56:49,962
Take the parachute.
It's more than fair.

1757
01:56:57,970 --> 01:56:59,722
Twenty years.

1758
01:57:03,434 --> 01:57:05,561
You know, I told myself
I'd be out of here

1759
01:57:05,645 --> 01:57:07,730
while I was still
in my thirties.

1760
01:57:08,898 --> 01:57:13,111
And now look at me.
I'm practically an old man.

1761
01:57:22,120 --> 01:57:23,246
Gentlemen.

1762
01:57:23,996 --> 01:57:25,206
Thanks, Mike.

1763
01:57:38,511 --> 01:57:39,595
CHANG: So...

1764
01:57:40,847 --> 01:57:43,182
What are we gonna do now?

1765
01:57:50,898 --> 01:57:53,568
We're gonna put
a dent in the universe.

1766
01:58:03,327 --> 01:58:04,579
Here's to the crazy ones.

1767
01:58:06,706 --> 01:58:08,708
The misfits,

1768
01:58:09,125 --> 01:58:10,710
the rebels,

1769
01:58:11,627 --> 01:58:13,337
the troublemakers,

1770
01:58:13,838 --> 01:58:16,382
the round pegs
in the square holes,

1771
01:58:17,425 --> 01:58:20,011
the ones who see
things differently.

1772
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:22,513
They're not fond of rules,

1773
01:58:23,055 --> 01:58:26,184
and they have no respect
for the status quo.

1774
01:58:27,810 --> 01:58:29,896
You can quote them,

1775
01:58:29,979 --> 01:58:31,773
disagree with them,

1776
01:58:31,856 --> 01:58:33,900
glorify or vilify them.

1777
01:58:34,942 --> 01:58:36,569
About the only thing
you can't do

1778
01:58:37,236 --> 01:58:39,197
is ignore them.

1779
01:58:39,530 --> 01:58:41,240
Because they change things.

1780
01:58:41,908 --> 01:58:44,285
They push
the human race forward.

1781
01:58:45,745 --> 01:58:47,955
And while some may see
them as the crazy ones,

1782
01:58:51,042 --> 01:58:52,710
we see genius.

1783
01:58:53,878 --> 01:58:56,255
Because the people
who are crazy enough

1784
01:58:56,339 --> 01:58:58,674
to think they can
change the world

1785
01:59:00,384 --> 01:59:02,178
are the ones who do.

1786
01:59:02,762 --> 01:59:05,139
(INAUDIBLE)

1787
01:59:10,186 --> 01:59:11,771
How was that?
