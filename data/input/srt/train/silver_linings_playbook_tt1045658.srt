from the local high school, which...

...wasn't true. It was a delusion.

222

Nance. It's my lucky day.
Look at you working on a Sunday.

280
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:33,595
- How are you? Hey.
- What are you doing here?

281
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:36,181
I just came by to say hi,
I'm ready to work.

282
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:38,976
- You shouldn't be here.
- Full-time, half-time.

283
00:17:39,143 --> 00:17:41,854
I'll work, I'll sub,
I'll work history, whatever.

284
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,689
Let me give you a hand. Sorry.

285
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:46,525
- I got it. I got it.
- Let me ask you something.

286
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:49,236
- Does Nikki still work here?
- Can't tell you.

287
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:52,322
- But Doug Culpepper is.
- Why would you tell me that?

288
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:55,492
He broke up my marriage.
Are you being a troublemaker?

289
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:58,412
You look good.
Did you lose a lot of weight?

290
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:02,249
- I did. Yeah, I did. Thank you.
- Aah! Get away from me. Get away.

291
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:05,836
OK, all right. I'm better.
I'm better now. OK, I'm better.

292
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:09,465
I feel so good. Look at my eyes.
Look how clear they are.

293
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:12,384
- Don't hug me.
- Not a complainer, I'm positive.

294
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:14,928
You have to give it time.
A lot went down.

295
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:19,933
- People will get over it. It'll work out.
- I'll take that as a silver development.

296
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,144
- That's a silver lining.
- Good luck.

297
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:30,068
Ronnie. Pat.

298
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:36,617
- There he is. He's back.
- Hey.

299
00:18:36,784 --> 00:18:38,285
- Welcome home.
- Thank you.

300
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:40,120
- Welcome back, man.
- I'm out.

301
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:43,457
Yeah, you're "out" out? Cool.
You lost a lot of weight.

302
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:46,710
I didn't recognise you.
I'm sorry I didn't visit you.

303
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:49,588
Work's out of control.
You know, she had the baby.

304
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:51,465
I'm really glad you're back.

305
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:54,384
I miss you.
I really need someone to talk to.

306
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:59,264
Come see the baby. She's beautiful.
Veronica wants to make dinner for you.

307
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:03,602
Congratulations on the baby
but I'm not buying the invitation.

308
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:06,313
Because you think Veronica
still hates you?

309
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:10,734
- I know Veronica still hates me.
- That's not true.

310
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:14,947
Yes, it is. Nikki always said that
Ronnie's wife keeps his social calendar

311
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:18,283
- where she keeps his balls, her purse.
- That's not true.

312
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,036
<font color="#808080">VERONICA:</font> - What are you doing?
- OK, it's a little true.

If you think she still hates you,
you're wrong

314
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:26,208
because why would she
invite you to dinner, hm?

315
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,377
- Did you invite him?<font color="#808080">
RONNIE:</font> - Yes!

316
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:29,962
Well, can he make it?

317
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,548
I don't know yet!

318
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:35,843
- Can you make it next Sunday?
- Sure.

319
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:39,888
- I'll see you next Sunday.
- You are still in touch with Nikki, right?

320
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:42,766
- Does Veronica still talk to Nikki?
- Yeah.

321
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:48,689
- Get in here, please. I need you.<font color="#808080">
RONNIE:</font> - OK.

322

As soon as you left, Redskins threw
a trick play, a pitchout to Randal El.

323

loses the challenge, the game.

324

You're in this house,
show some respect for what I do.

325
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:04,162
And we should spend time together.
I'm keeping you out of trouble.

I know.

330

Pat Solatano? Yeah?
Mrs Solatano, Mr Solatano,

342
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:50,417
I'm Officer Keogh.
I heard about the restraining order.

343
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:53,420
You went to your old house, school.
It's not OK.

344
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:56,632
I've been assigned to your case,
you'll see a lot of me.

345
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:00,719
Do yourself a favour. Respect the
restraining order. Five hundred feet.

346
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:04,014
You hear what he just said?
You have a restraining order.

347
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:05,724
- Yeah, I know.
- Thank you.

348
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:07,726
If you need anything, my card.

349
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:11,647
- Thank you. Sorry. We understand.
- Since when do cops have cards?

350
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,236
Tell me, would you like to be a guy

351
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:21,073
who goes back to jail
or to the hospital? Hm?

352
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:22,908
So take your medication.

353
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:27,537
- If you do fine, we'll reduce them.
- Nikki's waiting for me to get in shape,

354
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:30,415
get my life in order,
then she's gonna be with me.

355
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:33,168
And that's better
than any medication.

356
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:35,003
Pat, there's a possibility,

357
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,048
I want you to be prepared for it,
she may not return.

358
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:41,468
True love is about letting her go
and see if she returns.

359
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,514
Meantime, if you listen to that song,
I don't want you to fall apart.

360
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:48,100
So get a strategy, OK?
You need one.

361
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:51,269
- Let me say... Gonna say something.
- OK.

362
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:56,108
This is what I believe,
this is what I learned in the hospital.

363
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:59,069
You do everything you can,
work your hardest.

364
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:03,949
And if you do, if you stay positive,
you have a shot at a silver lining.

365
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,536
- Work on a strategy, OK?
- All right.

Why did you have this urgency
to see your wedding video?

Because I'm married,
I haven't seen my wife.

- After the dinner, she said, quote,

"We can go to the back house
and you can fuck me

00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:15,521
"as long as we turn the lights out,"
unquote.

669
00:39:15,688 --> 00:39:17,815
And she still wears
her wedding ring.

670
00:39:17,982 --> 00:39:20,609
So she's a loyal,
married-to-a-dead-guy slut.

671
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:24,530
Maybe she needs a friend
and she thought if she offers you sex,

672
00:39:24,697 --> 00:39:27,742
it will be easier for you
to become friends with her.

673
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:30,077
She said she's not a whore anymore,

674
00:39:30,244 --> 00:39:32,913
but she likes that part of herself

675
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,667
along with all the other parts of herself,
and can I say the same?

00:39:56,812 --> 00:40:00,900

of going outdoors, working out

684
00:40:01,067 --> 00:40:04,361
- and reading books.
- No. No, not the books.

685
00:40:04,528 --> 00:40:07,698
You said Nikki is friends
with Ronnie, Veronica, Tiffany.

686
00:40:07,865 --> 00:40:09,784
If you become friends with Tiffany,

687
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:13,329
Nikki will think you're a kind, generous,
large-hearted person

688
00:40:13,496 --> 00:40:17,124
who helps people in need,
who is basically thriving.

689
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:21,796
So if you help Tiffany,
it will be good for you.

- What did you do for me?
- Took care of that jerkoff at your house.

986
00:57:35,453 --> 00:57:37,288
- What? Jordie?
- Let me ask you,

987
00:57:37,455 --> 00:57:39,457
you call him when you're lonely?

988
00:57:40,625 --> 00:57:44,420
- That encourages him. Shouldn't do it.
- Say the same about Nikki?

989
00:57:44,587 --> 00:57:48,716
Not at all like me and Nikki.
We're in love and married. It's different.

990
00:57:48,883 --> 00:57:51,970
How are you in love?
Tell me about that.

991
00:57:52,262 --> 00:57:56,349
The big Nikki love. Tell me about it.
I wanna understand it.

992
00:57:56,516 --> 00:58:00,645
We have an unconventional chemistry.
Makes people feel awkward, but not me.

993
00:58:00,812 --> 00:58:03,064
She's the most beautiful woman
I've ever been with.

994
00:58:03,231 --> 00:58:05,775
- Wow.
- It's electric between us.

995
00:58:05,942 --> 00:58:09,821
Yeah, we wanna change each other, but
that's normal. Couples wanna do that.

996
00:58:09,988 --> 00:58:14,492
I want her to stop dressing like she
dresses, stop acting so superior to me.

997
00:58:14,659 --> 00:58:18,329
She wanted me to lose weight,
stop my mood swings, which I've done.

998
00:58:18,496 --> 00:58:20,290
People fight. Couples fight.

999
00:58:20,456 --> 00:58:23,376
We would fight,
we wouldn't talk for a couple weeks.

1000
00:58:23,543 --> 00:58:27,380
She wanted the best. She wanted me
to be passionate and compassionate.

1001
00:58:27,547 --> 00:58:31,843
That's a good thing. I'm my best self
today and she's her best self today.

1002
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:33,553
Our love's gonna be amazing.

1003
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,598
You're gonna be amazing
and she's gonna be amazing.

1004
00:58:36,764 --> 00:58:39,267
You're not gonna take advantage
of a situation

1005
00:58:39,434 --> 00:58:43,688
without offering to do something back.
So think about the dance thing.

we could get into things.

Randy, tell him what I'm doing.

1270
01:15:39,661 --> 01:15:42,623
He's betting everything
on the Giant game. Everything.

1271
01:15:42,789 --> 01:15:44,875
The money he needs
for the restaurant,

1272

So I'm gonna bet heavy
on this game.

1278

- You understand?<font color="#808080">

1279
01:16:02,643 --> 01:16:05,604
Heavy. I want you to go
to the game with your brother.

1280
01:16:05,938 --> 01:16:08,857

- I do.

1281
01:16:09,024 --> 01:16:11,276

- Of course.

1282
01:16:11,443 --> 01:16:13,904
- He told you that?
- He told me, yes.

1283
01:16:14,196 --> 01:16:17,115
- With his friends?
- With his friends. He trusts you.

1284
01:16:17,282 --> 01:16:18,825
- He's not embarrassed?
- No.

1285

I'd love to go to the game too,
but I'm banned from the stadium.

1289

- Randy.

1290

Patrizio, stop it.
Randy, don't you take the bet!
