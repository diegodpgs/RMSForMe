1
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,235
Charles, you have
finally lost your senses.

2
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,112
This venture is impossible.

3
00:01:19,154 --> 00:01:22,324
For some. Gentlemen, the only way
to achieve the impossible

4
00:01:22,407 --> 00:01:24,284
is to believe it is possible.

5
00:01:24,326 --> 00:01:26,161
That kind of thinking could ruin you.

6
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,330
I'm willing to take that chance.

7
00:01:28,413 --> 00:01:32,918
Imagine trading posts
in Rangoon, Bangkok, Jakarta...

8
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,300
The nightmare again?

9
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:47,015
I won't be long.

10
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,020
I'm falling down a dark hole,

11
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:56,525
then I see strange creatures.

12
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:59,027
What kind of creatures?

13
00:01:59,111 --> 00:02:05,659
Well, there's a dodo bird,
a rabbit in a waistcoat, a smiling cat.

14
00:02:05,742 --> 00:02:07,828
I didn't know cats could smile.

15
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,122
(SIGHING) Neither did I.

16
00:02:10,622 --> 00:02:13,458
And there's a blue caterpillar.

17
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,169
Blue caterpillar.

18
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:17,963
Hmm.

19
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:21,758
Do you think I've gone round the bend?

20
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:31,852
I'm afraid so.
You're mad, bonkers, off your head.

21
00:02:32,728 --> 00:02:36,898
But I'll tell you a secret.
All the best people are.

22
00:02:36,982 --> 00:02:38,024
(LAUGHING)

23
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:41,570
It's only a dream, Alice.
Nothing can harm you there.

24
00:02:41,653 --> 00:02:45,532
But if you get too frightened,
you can always wake up. Like this.

25
00:02:45,615 --> 00:02:46,867
(LAUGHING) Ow!

26
00:02:49,286 --> 00:02:50,412
(SIGHING)

27
00:03:06,261 --> 00:03:07,763
Must we go?

28
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,808
Doubt they'll notice if we never arrive.

29
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:13,560
They will notice.

30
00:03:16,188 --> 00:03:18,065
Where's your corset?

31
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:25,238
And no stockings.

32
00:03:25,322 --> 00:03:26,615
I'm against them.

33
00:03:26,698 --> 00:03:28,367
But you're not properly dressed.

34
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,952
Who's to say what is proper?

35
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:34,289
What if it was agreed that "proper"
was wearing a codfish on your head?

36
00:03:34,373 --> 00:03:36,458
- Would you wear it?
- Alice.

37
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:39,252
To me, a corset is like a codfish.

38
00:03:39,294 --> 00:03:41,630
Please, not today.

39
00:03:41,713 --> 00:03:43,715
Father would have laughed.

40
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:50,764
I'm sorry. I'm tired.
I didn't sleep well last night.

41
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,308
Did you have bad dreams again?

42
00:03:53,392 --> 00:03:54,768
Only one.

43
00:03:55,894 --> 00:03:58,939
It's always the same,
ever since I can remember.

44
00:03:59,022 --> 00:04:01,566
Do you think that's normal?

45
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:04,319
Don't most people
have different dreams?

46
00:04:04,986 --> 00:04:06,655
I don't know.

47
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,999
There. You're beautiful.

48
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,627
Now, can you manage a smile?

(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

At last. We thought you'd never arrive.

51
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:43,984
Alice, Hamish is waiting
to dance with you. Go.

52
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,990
You do realize it's well past 4:00.

53
00:04:50,032 --> 00:04:51,700
Now everything will have
to be rushed through.

54
00:04:51,783 --> 00:04:54,453
- I am sorry.
- Oh, never mind!

55
00:04:58,623 --> 00:05:02,794
Forgive my wife. She's been planning
this affair for over 20 years.

56
00:05:03,754 --> 00:05:05,964
If only Charles were here...

57
00:05:06,631 --> 00:05:08,175
My condolences.

58
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:13,013
I think of your husband often.
He was truly a man of vision.

59
00:05:14,556 --> 00:05:18,185
I hope you don't think I've taken
advantage of your misfortunes.

60
00:05:18,226 --> 00:05:21,730
Of course not. I'm pleased
that you purchased the company.

61
00:05:23,148 --> 00:05:27,527
I was a fool for not investing in
his mad venture when I had the chance.

62
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,030
Charles thought so, too.

(CLASSICAL MUSIC

Hamish, do you ever tire of quadrille?

65
00:05:51,927 --> 00:05:54,971
On the contrary. I find it invigorating.

No.

69
00:06:03,688 --> 00:06:06,691
I had a sudden vision
of all the ladies in trousers

70
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,860
and the men wearing dresses.

71
00:06:09,027 --> 00:06:11,863
I think you'll do best
to keep your visions to yourself.

72

Pardon us, sir.

Where's your head?

77
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:30,549
I was wondering
what it would be like to fly.

78
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,675
Why would you spend your time

79
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,927
thinking about
such an impossible thing?

80
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:35,303
Why wouldn't I?

81
00:06:35,387 --> 00:06:38,640
My father said he sometimes believed
in six impossible things

82
00:06:38,724 --> 00:06:39,808

We have a secret to tell you.

If you're telling me,
then it's not much of a secret.

88
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:58,827
- Perhaps we shouldn't.
- We decided we should.

89
00:06:58,869 --> 00:06:59,995
If we tell her, she won't be surprised.

90
00:07:00,037 --> 00:07:02,998
- Will you be surprised?
- Not if you tell me.

91

But now you've brought it up,
you have to.

- No, we don't.
- In fact, we won't.

I wonder if your mother knows

that you two swim naked
in the Havershims' pond.

95

- You wouldn't.
- Oh, but I would.

There's your mother right now.

You've ruined the surprise!

00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,521
I could strangle them!

It's why they've all come.
This is your engagement party.

Hamish will ask you under the gazebo.
When you say yes...

But I don't know
if I want to marry Hamish.

105

Who, then?
You won't do better than a lord.

106

You'll soon be 20, Alice.
That pretty face won't last forever.

107

You don't want to end up
like Aunt Imogene.

And you don't want to be a burden

No.

00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:02,682
So you'll marry Hamish.

111

You will be as happy
as I am with Lowell,

I'll leave you to it.

Shall we take a leisurely stroll
through the garden, just you and me?
