your mother went to.

in a time capsule. It's a list of dates,

mother's predictions

609
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:50,453
and I watched 81 people burn to death
in that plane crash yesterday,

611
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:55,295
and there was nothing
I could do about it.

612
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:58,266
