1
00:01:12,817 --> 00:01:15,370
- Morning.
- Morning, priest.

2
00:01:19,985 --> 00:01:24,393
It was about 3 years ago. I was
the only kid in church that day.

3
00:01:25,361 --> 00:01:27,630
The others were with Isaac
out at the cornfield.

4
00:01:27,953 --> 00:01:30,342
I didn't get to go
'cause dad didn't like Isaac.

5
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,942
He was pretty smart, my dad.

6
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:37,095
After church we've been
to Hansen's, just like always.

7
00:01:37,425 --> 00:01:41,320
Sarah was homesick with mom.
She'd turned down with a fever.

8
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:46,605
- Morning, Dave.
- Morning.

9
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:49,101
- How are your wife and Sarah?
- Dad was worried...

10
00:01:49,361 --> 00:01:51,215
so he went to call mom
first thing.

11
00:01:51,793 --> 00:01:54,313
- I'm gonna call your mom, ok?
- Okay!

12
00:01:59,217 --> 00:02:02,250
- You want the usual?
- Yeah, strawberty shake.

13
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:05,004
That's when I saw Malachai
and the others.

14
00:02:05,777 --> 00:02:08,046
I guess the meeting with Isaac
was over.

15
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:13,673
They were acting real creepy.

16
00:02:16,145 --> 00:02:18,316
- There you go, Jobie.
- Thanks.

17
00:02:30,225 --> 00:02:33,706
- How is she?
- I'm worried, Dave.

18
00:02:34,609 --> 00:02:37,609
The fever's gone
from 101 to 104.

19
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:43,723
Sure.

20
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:13,103
Okay.

21
00:03:18,481 --> 00:03:19,888
Good coffee.

22
00:03:41,617 --> 00:03:42,959
Oh, my God!

23
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:09,961
No!

24
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:38,506
It happened everywhere
in Gatlin that day.

25
00:04:39,505 --> 00:04:42,472
That's when Sarah started
drawing these pictures.

26
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:53,164
Happy birthday!

27
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:57,575
What are you doing?

28
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:03,787
C'mon!
Make a wish.

29
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,144
What did you wish for?

30
00:07:20,464 --> 00:07:22,319
To live happily ever after.

31
00:07:23,537 --> 00:07:29,004
- Is that a proposal?
- No, it's not.

32
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:34,923
Well, I guess I'll
give you this anyway.

33
00:07:41,936 --> 00:07:43,343
What is it?

34
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:52,485
- That's nice!
- Turn it over.

35
00:08:03,408 --> 00:08:06,757
In honor of this special occasion
we'll have a birthday serenade.

36
00:08:09,297 --> 00:08:12,493
1, 2.
1, 2, 3, 4.

37
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:15,369
No more books and studies

38
00:08:15,632 --> 00:08:18,632
Now I can stay all day
With my buddies

39
00:08:18,897 --> 00:08:23,752
I can do the things I wanna do
'Cause all my exams are through

40
00:08:24,592 --> 00:08:27,626
I can root for the Yankees
From the beaches

41
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:30,703
And don't have to worry
About teachers

42
00:08:30,992 --> 00:08:33,862
And I'm so glad
That school is out

43
00:08:34,128 --> 00:08:36,397
I could sing and shout

44
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:40,142
School is out
Everybody's gonna have some fun

45
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,117
Everybody's gonna jump and run

46
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,223
C'mon, people
Don't you be late

47
00:08:46,545 --> 00:08:49,327
I just got time
To take my girl out today

48
00:08:49,713 --> 00:08:52,974
You're whacko.

49
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,142
Holy cow!

50
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,175
We better get going now.
I got a lot of driving to do today.

51
00:09:08,113 --> 00:09:10,022
Couldn't wejust say
the hell with it...

52
00:09:10,385 --> 00:09:12,970
- and stay for a couple of hours?
- I wish.

53
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:17,197
Starting Monday I've got
fifty patients a day to look at

54
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:21,518
- I've some things you could look at.
- Is that right?

55
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,917
Hello?

56
00:09:28,592 --> 00:09:30,414
Hello?
Maid service.

57
00:09:30,705 --> 00:09:32,843
We'll be out in a minute.

58
00:09:34,256 --> 00:09:35,849
We gotta get going.

59
00:09:36,657 --> 00:09:38,926
I'm gonna grab a quick shower
before we go, okay?

60
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,997
C'mon, honey! You're making
something out of nothing.

61
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,906
To me is something,
to you is nothing.

62
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,816
I'm just worried about this
internship, okay?

63
00:10:04,272 --> 00:10:06,094
I've been working forthis
forfouryears.

64
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:07,978
I know.

65
00:10:09,617 --> 00:10:11,559
I do understand.

66
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:16,421
Why do you have to be
such ajerk about it?

67
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:25,360
Welcome to Nebraska.

68
00:10:52,817 --> 00:10:55,370
We weren't the only ones
who thought Isaac was weird.

69
00:10:56,304 --> 00:10:58,508
One day Joseph told us
he was running away.

70
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,935
He said he couldn't
take it anymore.

71
00:11:01,264 --> 00:11:03,631
He was pretty scared.
I wasn't.

72
00:11:03,888 --> 00:11:06,092
- I'm scared.
- Me too.

73
00:11:06,384 --> 00:11:07,911
There's nothing to be afraid of.

74
00:11:08,177 --> 00:11:10,348
I said I'd come back foryou.
I promise.

75
00:11:10,576 --> 00:11:12,813
- Can we go with you? Please!
- No.

76
00:11:13,104 --> 00:11:14,697
I'd never make it with you two.

77
00:11:14,993 --> 00:11:17,840
- But we don't like it here.
- I said you'll be alright!

78
00:11:18,192 --> 00:11:20,363
As long as nobody finds
that pictures you've been drawing.

79
00:11:20,624 --> 00:11:22,053
She can't help it.

80
00:11:22,288 --> 00:11:24,557
That won't matter
to Isaac and Malachai

81
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:26,312
They'll take it as a sign.

82
00:11:26,544 --> 00:11:28,649
Anyway, you now crayons
and drawings are forbidden.

83
00:11:28,881 --> 00:11:31,598
- Just like that record player.
- But we like it.

84
00:11:31,856 --> 00:11:33,799
Isaac doesn't let us do anything.

85
00:11:34,064 --> 00:11:36,366
Youjust better mind
until I get back.

86
00:11:36,656 --> 00:11:39,242
Or else, you know what happens.

87
00:11:42,737 --> 00:11:46,185
- Are you going through the corn?
- I can't go no other way.

88
00:11:46,577 --> 00:11:48,682
- What if...
- I said it'll be alright.

89
00:11:49,488 --> 00:11:52,554
- Unless you tell anybody I'm gone.
- We won't.

90
00:11:52,752 --> 00:11:57,225
Cross your heat? Hope to die,
stick a needle in your eye.

91
00:11:57,712 --> 00:11:59,468
You know what that means now?

92
00:11:59,696 --> 00:12:02,795
If you tell, you're gonna burn in
a lake of fire for all eternity.

93
00:12:03,345 --> 00:12:05,003
Make sure nobody's looking.

94
00:12:09,744 --> 00:12:14,796
- Okay. Go!
- Nobody's looking.

95
00:12:59,056 --> 00:13:00,812
I spy...

96
00:13:02,096 --> 00:13:04,071
something that begins
with the letter "C".

97
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:06,634
- Corn.
- Right.

98
00:13:07,088 --> 00:13:08,976
So now we know...

99
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:12,271
back roads are even less
interesting than the highways.

100
00:13:14,448 --> 00:13:16,204
Maybe they've discovered music...

101
00:13:16,592 --> 00:13:19,975
Hallelujah!
There are many Lord's mansions...

102
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:24,747
but there's no room
for the fornicator!

103
00:13:25,008 --> 00:13:27,496
- No room!
- No room...

104
00:13:27,729 --> 00:13:30,478
- for the homosexual!
- No room!

105
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:34,410
No room
for the drugs user!

106
00:13:34,608 --> 00:13:36,069
No room!

107
00:13:36,944 --> 00:13:39,278
Amen.
Peanut butter and white bread!

108
00:13:39,504 --> 00:13:41,511
There's no room
forthe college graduated!

109
00:13:41,808 --> 00:13:44,361
No room for people
who watch public television.

110
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,048
- No room for commitments!
- Amen!

111
00:13:49,905 --> 00:13:51,530
C'mon!

112
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,074
Here it is.

113
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:02,922
- I wonder how it got here.
- Not me.

114
00:15:09,489 --> 00:15:12,358
It looks like this one
goes to Grand Island...

115
00:15:13,072 --> 00:15:14,534
and this one
cuts up to the highway.

116
00:15:18,832 --> 00:15:21,134
Where's this Gatlin that we've
been seeing the signs for?

117
00:15:21,808 --> 00:15:26,086
- It's not on here.
- How come? It's gotta be.

118
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:28,197
Look out!

119
00:15:39,344 --> 00:15:41,800
Hang on.
Let me check.

120
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,244
Let me check.

121
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:46,823
- Where? Right there?
- Yeah.

122
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,437
It was just a bump.
Just tty to relax.

123
00:15:53,776 --> 00:15:56,231
That was an animal, right?

124
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,587
I gotta go back there, okay
Just stay here and tty to rest.

125
00:16:14,736 --> 00:16:16,329
C'mon, buddy.

126
00:16:18,192 --> 00:16:19,654
Oh God!

127
00:16:24,688 --> 00:16:27,721
- Is he...
- Oh yeah.

128
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,877
- Oh God!
- Easy, easy. C'mon.

129
00:16:40,688 --> 00:16:42,412
Easy.
Don't look at him.

130
00:16:48,624 --> 00:16:52,039
Now listen to me.
There's something vety wrong here.

131
00:16:52,624 --> 00:16:55,177
So I want you to go back to the car
and wait for me there. Understand?

132
00:16:55,408 --> 00:16:58,026
- And keep the doors locked.
- Why? Where are you going?

133
00:16:58,256 --> 00:17:00,645
I'll tell you when I get back.
Just do what I say.

134
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,000
Burt.

135
00:19:20,016 --> 00:19:21,423
Burt.

136
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,215
Burt.

137
00:19:37,104 --> 00:19:38,446
Burt.

138
00:19:58,096 --> 00:19:59,471
I'm so sorty.

139
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,718
- Vicky, c'mon.
- Burt!

140
00:20:05,232 --> 00:20:08,166
- Easy. Calm down.
- I kneeled down next to him.

141
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,808
It's ok. Take it easy.
Take it easy and relax.

142
00:20:15,472 --> 00:20:19,433
It's okay, understand?
You're okay.

143
00:21:05,936 --> 00:21:09,548
Me and Sarah were playing in our
old house. We play there lots.

144
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,978
Malachai said it was forbidden.

145
00:21:12,656 --> 00:21:15,503
But I think that's because nobody
ever asked him to play.

146
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,161
When I grow up, I'm gonna have
all the money in the world.

147
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,757
- Me too.
- You can't.

148
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,666
- Why not?
- 'Cause I'm gonna have it.

149
00:21:26,992 --> 00:21:28,999
- I'll get it first.
- Will not.

150
00:21:29,296 --> 00:21:30,638
- Will too.
- Will not.

151
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:33,581
- Will too.
- Oh yeah? How?

152
00:21:44,207 --> 00:21:45,549
Seven.

153
00:21:46,192 --> 00:21:52,520
One, two, three, four,
five, six...

154
00:21:53,296 --> 00:21:55,401
seven.

155
00:21:55,631 --> 00:21:57,901
Alright! See?
Two hundred dollars.

156
00:21:58,128 --> 00:22:00,015
No, Jobie!

157
00:22:06,128 --> 00:22:07,590
How much?

158
00:22:08,015 --> 00:22:12,805
- Thirteen thousand hundred dollars.
- Thirteen thousand hundred dollars?

159
00:22:13,711 --> 00:22:16,078
Okay, two thousand.

160
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,054
I thought so.

161
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,142
One hundred, two hundred, three...
I gotta a great idea.

162
00:22:24,527 --> 00:22:29,383
Let's pretend this guy is Isaac
and we'll put him injail.

163
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:32,906
What if he gets to get out
ofjail with a free card?

164
00:22:35,247 --> 00:22:37,190
What card?

165
00:22:56,144 --> 00:22:59,527
You think it might've been some
accident with farm equipment?

166
00:22:59,824 --> 00:23:01,799
Not like that.

167
00:23:03,312 --> 00:23:05,581
His throat was cut deliberately.

168
00:23:07,184 --> 00:23:10,151
He was already dead
when he stumbled down the road.

169
00:23:10,767 --> 00:23:13,353
Whoever killed him,
do you think he saw us?

170
00:23:14,191 --> 00:23:17,606
- I felt like we're being watched.
- Possible.

171
00:23:19,055 --> 00:23:21,511
Blood starts to coagulate
in four minutes.

172
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,618
When I went to get the suitcase
it was still fresh.

173
00:23:25,808 --> 00:23:28,710
- He could have been out there!
- I couldn'tjust leave it there.

174
00:23:29,072 --> 00:23:31,243
What if it holds
some sort of clue?

175
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,458
- Let's open it.
- No.

176
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:39,695
Let's just get to a phone
or a house or some place.

177
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:45,479
Malachai took us
right to Isaac.

178
00:23:45,775 --> 00:23:49,321
He'd finally convinced him
punishing us for being unbelievers.

179
00:23:49,648 --> 00:23:52,266
Up to them, we've been forgiven
'cause we were in the corn...

180
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,309
the day that "He Who Walks Behind
the Rows" made himself known.

181
00:23:55,696 --> 00:23:59,340
That bothered Malachai.
He had a lot of problems.

182
00:24:07,728 --> 00:24:09,800
I found these two
in one of the old homes...

183
00:24:10,287 --> 00:24:12,491
they had a game, music...

184
00:24:15,343 --> 00:24:16,838
and this.

185
00:24:19,696 --> 00:24:22,062
They come already.

186
00:24:29,008 --> 00:24:31,048
You have the gift of sight.

187
00:24:32,015 --> 00:24:35,660
- This is a blessing, my child.
- I've seen this car up on the road.

188
00:24:36,336 --> 00:24:40,133
Go to the old man.
Make sure he tells them nothing.

189
00:24:40,463 --> 00:24:42,438
What about these two?

190
00:24:47,663 --> 00:24:49,518
Take them back
where they were.

191
00:24:49,743 --> 00:24:52,460
But they had a game and music.
They're forbidden.

192
00:24:52,687 --> 00:24:56,811
Question me not, Malachai.
I act according to His will.

193
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,160
It seems we are in the Moon.
We haven't even seen a truck.

194
00:25:17,327 --> 00:25:19,149
We'll be in Gatlin soon.

195
00:25:21,935 --> 00:25:23,528
Do you think he lived there?

196
00:25:24,592 --> 00:25:26,828
We may never knowthat.

197
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,603
I really thing we should open it.

198
00:25:32,335 --> 00:25:33,829
Okay.

199
00:25:42,672 --> 00:25:44,232
Let's see if we can get
some news.

200
00:25:49,711 --> 00:25:51,304
I'm getting tired of that crap.

201
00:25:58,063 --> 00:25:59,492
What is it?

202
00:26:03,856 --> 00:26:06,638
- Jesus Christ!
- Not in my Book.

203
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,069
- It looks like primitive folk art.
- I think it's repulsive.

204
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,909
Sarge, bring the number six.

205
00:26:27,856 --> 00:26:29,645
Damn it!
You better give me the eight.

206
00:26:32,815 --> 00:26:35,498
C'mon.
We haven't got all day.

207
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:44,334
Good boy.

208
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,149
We'll have that transmission fixed
in no time...

209
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:49,897
then, we'll get on the radiator.

210
00:26:51,215 --> 00:26:54,532
Damn. This road is becoming
a bloody highway.

211
00:26:54,991 --> 00:26:57,609
I think it's the third car
in a month.

212
00:26:58,351 --> 00:27:00,457
We know what to do, don't we?

213
00:27:09,871 --> 00:27:11,464
We better put that suitcase away.

214
00:27:15,471 --> 00:27:16,878
I'll be right back.

215
00:27:21,327 --> 00:27:24,458
- Hi, we got a...
- I ain't got no gas.

216
00:27:24,815 --> 00:27:27,303
- I don't need gas.
- I ain't got no diesel.

217
00:27:27,983 --> 00:27:30,317
- You don't understand. I need...
- lf you don't buy gas...

218
00:27:30,575 --> 00:27:32,463
you can't use the rest room.

219
00:27:34,415 --> 00:27:36,455
- I need to use your phone.
- Telephone?

220
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:38,728
I ain't got no telephone.
Sarge.

221
00:27:42,639 --> 00:27:44,744
Sarge, you be still.

222
00:27:50,512 --> 00:27:57,320
You have to go to Hemingford.
It's about 19 miles down there.

223
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:00,486
- What about Gatlin?
- There ain't nothing in Gatlin.

224
00:28:04,431 --> 00:28:06,319
What do you mean:
"There ain't nothing in Gatlin."?

225
00:28:06,639 --> 00:28:09,421
Folks in Gatlin got religious.
They don't like outsiders...

226
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:11,982
and they probably won't have
a phone there either.

227
00:28:12,592 --> 00:28:17,098
I'd like to stay here and talk,
but I got a transmission to fix.

228
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:21,289
If you get on that road
you'll be in Hemingford in no time.

229
00:28:21,584 --> 00:28:25,991
- Right.
- Sarge, sit! At ease!

230
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:28,869
Thanks a lot.

231
00:28:31,823 --> 00:28:33,962
Sarge!

232
00:28:34,703 --> 00:28:38,151
Eitherthat man is senile, or he's
being out in the Sun fortoo long.

233
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,046
Sarge!
Come back here.

234
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,747
Sarge!
Come back here!

235
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:52,200
Under the awning!

236
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,068
You hear me?
Come back here.

237
00:28:56,496 --> 00:28:57,837
That's an order.

238
00:29:06,831 --> 00:29:09,068
Who is it?
Is that you?

239
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:12,104
What do you want?

240
00:29:29,007 --> 00:29:30,949
What are you doing there?

241
00:29:47,855 --> 00:29:51,019
Well, there really isn't that much
stuff in here. Just kids' stuff.

242
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:54,792
Clothes, matches,
compass, pocket knife.

243
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:57,770
- I don't get it. Camping stuff?
- Yeah.

244
00:29:59,439 --> 00:30:02,505
Oh, great!
This must be our day.

245
00:30:03,407 --> 00:30:05,862
In the last sign we saw
Gatlin was 3 miles...

246
00:30:06,128 --> 00:30:08,299
- and pointed that way?
- That's what I thought.

247
00:30:08,943 --> 00:30:12,653
- Did I miss a turn?
- No, we've been going straight.

248
00:30:13,615 --> 00:30:16,036
Somebody's been
messing with the signs.

249
00:30:16,688 --> 00:30:19,077
Hemingford is gotta be
straight ahead.

250
00:30:27,663 --> 00:30:29,190
Must have been the wind.

251
00:30:57,104 --> 00:31:01,359
These latches ain't worth a damn.
Blow all for nothing.

252
00:31:13,807 --> 00:31:17,004
I nevertold them nothing.
I swear it.

253
00:31:17,327 --> 00:31:19,465
I kept our bargain
just like always.

254
00:31:23,984 --> 00:31:27,845
Jesus Christ! Gatlin! What do they
have? Amonopoly on road signs?

255
00:31:28,623 --> 00:31:30,728
What about Hemingford?

256
00:31:30,927 --> 00:31:33,610
For people who don't like visitors
they sure do advertise enough.

257
00:31:37,455 --> 00:31:39,789
Overthere.

258
00:31:43,727 --> 00:31:45,637
Of course, it's the wind.

259
00:32:15,215 --> 00:32:17,671
Why did you have to go
afterthem, Sarge?

260
00:32:29,071 --> 00:32:32,616
You bastards!
You can't do this to me.

261
00:33:00,175 --> 00:33:01,517
I know you're in here.

262
00:33:10,895 --> 00:33:11,943
C'mon! C'mon!

263
00:33:23,215 --> 00:33:25,833
I can smell you, you stinky
little skunks.

264
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:27,879
C'mon!

265
00:33:35,855 --> 00:33:37,830
Murderers little devils!

266
00:33:40,015 --> 00:33:41,160
C'mon!

267
00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:08,075
- What was that?
- Probably my golf bag.

268
00:34:08,975 --> 00:34:11,015
- Are you sure?
- What do you mean: "Am I sure."?

269
00:34:34,927 --> 00:34:37,000
This isn't even a road.

270
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:39,694
- We'll never gotta get out of here.
- We'll too. Stop it.

271
00:34:43,695 --> 00:34:44,589
Sorty.

272
00:34:47,183 --> 00:34:49,322
- Just tell me where we are.
- I don't know.

273
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,523
We're back where we started from.

274
00:35:04,751 --> 00:35:07,303
We never should have listen
to that old fool.

275
00:35:08,879 --> 00:35:11,781
Hemingford is 19 miles,
Gatlin is only 3.

276
00:35:11,983 --> 00:35:14,536
I don't care how much religious
they've got. We're going there.

277
00:35:15,695 --> 00:35:18,062
Don't ever show up
in my emergency room, buddy.

278
00:35:36,015 --> 00:35:37,771
Behold.

279
00:35:38,831 --> 00:35:44,166
Adream did come to me in the
night. And the Lord show all to me.

280
00:35:44,495 --> 00:35:47,343
Praise God!
Praise the Lord.

281
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,184
Atime of tribulation has come.

282
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:53,191
Atest is at hand.

283
00:35:54,351 --> 00:35:57,799
- The final test.
- What has the Lord commanded?

284
00:35:58,415 --> 00:35:59,429
In the dream...

285
00:36:00,047 --> 00:36:03,243
the Lord did come to me
and he was a shape.

286
00:36:03,823 --> 00:36:06,572
It was He Who Walks
Behind The Rows.

287
00:36:07,183 --> 00:36:09,933
And I did fall on my knees
in terror and hide my eyes...

288
00:36:10,191 --> 00:36:13,573
unless the fierceness of His face
struck me dead.

289
00:36:14,223 --> 00:36:16,841
He told me all
that it since happened.

290
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:22,345
He said:"Joseph has taken his
things and fled this happy place...

291
00:36:22,671 --> 00:36:26,533
because the worship of me
is no more upon him...

292
00:36:26,991 --> 00:36:31,269
so take you his life
and spill his blood".

293
00:36:31,598 --> 00:36:33,867
- He did?
- Yes.

294
00:36:34,222 --> 00:36:37,070
"But let not the flesh
pollute the corn.

295
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:40,206
- Cast him instead upon the road."
- And so was done.

296
00:36:40,463 --> 00:36:42,732
Joseph, the betrayer,
was cast out.

297
00:36:43,215 --> 00:36:45,965
And He Who Walks
Behind the Rows did say...

298
00:36:46,735 --> 00:36:49,485
"I will send outlanders
amongst you.

299
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:53,635
Aman and a woman.
And these outlanders...

300
00:36:53,871 --> 00:36:56,905
will be unbelievers
and profaners of the holy".

301
00:36:57,231 --> 00:37:00,526
- I thought Isaac never came here.
- But he's always been here.

302
00:37:00,815 --> 00:37:03,116
Just like He Who Walks
Behind The Rows.

303
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:05,644
"And the man shall
sorely test you...

304
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:10,506
for He has great power. Even
greaterthan that of the blue man.

305
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:13,992
The blue man!
Yes, the blue man!

306
00:37:14,895 --> 00:37:17,797
And just as the blue man
was offered upon to Him...

307
00:37:18,095 --> 00:37:22,764
- so shall be the unbelievers!
- Make sacrifice unto Him.

308
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,708
Bring the blood
of the outlanders.

309
00:37:25,903 --> 00:37:27,976
Praise God!
Praise The Lord!

310
00:37:28,207 --> 00:37:30,825
Praise God!
Praise The Lord!

311
00:37:31,087 --> 00:37:33,356
Praise God!
Praise The Lord!

312
00:37:33,646 --> 00:37:36,035
Praise God!
Praise The Lord!

313
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:39,085
Praise God!
Praise The Lord!

314
00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:40,837
Let's get out of here!

315
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:43,595
Praise God!
Praise The Lord!

316
00:37:43,823 --> 00:37:46,311
Praise God!
Praise The Lord!

317
00:38:21,423 --> 00:38:23,114
It looks like a swinging place.

318
00:38:37,614 --> 00:38:39,753
I guess nobody told them
we were coming.

319
00:38:40,207 --> 00:38:41,800
I hope not.

320
00:38:43,791 --> 00:38:45,514
I don't see anybody.

321
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:55,500
Town Hall.

322
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:59,085
Grocety store. Hansen's Cafe.
It seems they got a phone.

323
00:39:00,142 --> 00:39:02,444
Unless a ghost is using it.

324
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,636
- What is it with this corn?
- You got me.

325
00:39:54,799 --> 00:39:57,995
Is dead.
Just like evetything else here.

326
00:40:01,134 --> 00:40:05,477
- A rat.
- Yeah. Just an ordinaty rat.

327
00:40:06,286 --> 00:40:08,839
Now can we
get out of here, please?

328
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,021
Wait a minute!
Come back here!

329
00:40:14,607 --> 00:40:16,746
C'mon, Vicky. Hurty up.
I don't wanna lose them.

330
00:40:30,286 --> 00:40:31,912
What are you gonna do
if you catch them?

331
00:40:32,206 --> 00:40:34,213
Ask where we can get help.
What else?

332
00:40:34,607 --> 00:40:36,679
They just got off that way.

333
00:40:40,558 --> 00:40:42,152
Damn!
Where did they go?

334
00:40:43,663 --> 00:40:47,721
We're already in the car. Why
wouldn't wejust go to Hemingford?

335
00:40:48,015 --> 00:40:50,404
- That would take us 20 minutes.
- We'd just found people.

336
00:40:50,606 --> 00:40:53,127
Yeah, three kids
that tried to steal our car.

337
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:57,095
There's something
vety strange about this town.

338
00:41:03,278 --> 00:41:05,547
We'd be better off
in a biggertown anyway.

339
00:41:06,222 --> 00:41:08,775
- The size of Seattle.
- Yeah.

340
00:41:18,415 --> 00:41:20,782
- Overthere!
- What?

341
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:24,812
- I just saw a door open and close.
- I didn't see anything.

342
00:41:26,382 --> 00:41:29,579
- Let's check it out.
- Why? I thought we were going.

343
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:33,572
- Settle down.
- Don't patronize me.

344
00:41:33,775 --> 00:41:35,814
I'm not patronizing you. I just
wanna see if there's someone there.

345
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,764
Hello?

346
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:53,513
Hello?

347
00:41:56,942 --> 00:41:58,568
Anybody home?

348
00:42:01,455 --> 00:42:03,910
We've had an accident.
We need to use your phone.

349
00:42:05,775 --> 00:42:08,295
Okay.
Now can we go?

350
00:42:14,447 --> 00:42:17,643
- Burt, this is somebody's house.
- I know. I just want a phone.

351
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:19,911
Hello?

352
00:42:46,991 --> 00:42:48,779
Gross.

353
00:42:51,183 --> 00:42:52,557
I'll check out the back.

354
00:43:05,647 --> 00:43:07,534
I found the phone.

355
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:13,412
Matches the decor.
This is three years old.

356
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:20,423
I don't understand
what's going on here.

357
00:43:21,582 --> 00:43:23,851
Well, can we go?

358
00:43:31,215 --> 00:43:32,230
Burt!

359
00:43:50,511 --> 00:43:51,820
Hello?

360
00:44:00,622 --> 00:44:02,116
Anybody here?

361
00:45:20,495 --> 00:45:23,910
Don't be afraid.
We didn't mean to scare you.

362
00:45:24,943 --> 00:45:26,601
Hi!

363
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:32,013
- What's your name?
- Sarah.

364
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:35,020
Sarah!
That's a beautiful name.

365
00:45:36,015 --> 00:45:39,593
- This is Burt and I'm Vicky.
- Are you here alone, Sarah?

366
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:43,780
Do you live here?

367
00:45:45,455 --> 00:45:47,910
Youjust come here to play?

368
00:45:50,382 --> 00:45:54,026
- Are your mommy and daddy around?
- They're in the corn field.

369
00:45:55,759 --> 00:45:59,239
- What are they doing there?
- All the grown ups are there.

370
00:45:59,662 --> 00:46:02,957
Are they working there
or having a meeting?

371
00:46:03,695 --> 00:46:06,826
No. Isaac put them there.

372
00:46:07,502 --> 00:46:08,996
Who's Isaac?

373
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:15,266
- Sweetheart, tell us who Isaac is.
- Our leader.

374
00:46:15,854 --> 00:46:17,098
Leader of what?

375
00:46:18,574 --> 00:46:20,330
Evetybody.

376
00:46:22,286 --> 00:46:23,235
Of course.

377
00:46:27,438 --> 00:46:30,057
Listen,
could you take us to Isaac?

378
00:46:31,598 --> 00:46:34,347
- Why not?
- He's scaty.

379
00:46:34,638 --> 00:46:38,980
It's vety important we speak to
some grown ups as soon as possible.

380
00:46:39,342 --> 00:46:42,310
- We're wasting ourtime, Vicky.
- Give her a chance.

381
00:46:43,215 --> 00:46:44,938
I'm gonna go look
at the Town Hall.

382
00:46:45,327 --> 00:46:47,115
Why?

383
00:46:48,334 --> 00:46:49,959
Because we have a murder
to report...

384
00:46:50,222 --> 00:46:52,775
and we're walking in circles,
wasting ourtime.

385
00:46:53,294 --> 00:46:56,426
- Maybe she can help.
- Fine. You stay here with her.

386
00:46:59,342 --> 00:47:01,763
Things aren't happening fast.

387
00:47:03,182 --> 00:47:04,611
I'm gonna leave you the car.

388
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:08,074
I won't be gone vety long.
If anybody comes, honk. Okay?

389
00:47:12,878 --> 00:47:14,601
Are we safe?

390
00:47:15,822 --> 00:47:18,572
Yes. It's weird here,
but it's safe.

391
00:47:19,598 --> 00:47:21,005
I'll be back.

392
00:47:38,574 --> 00:47:41,193
So, it looks like it's just
you and me.

393
00:47:43,054 --> 00:47:45,803
What were you doing here
by yourself? Just playing records?

394
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:50,765
Come on, you can tell me.

395
00:47:52,974 --> 00:47:54,535
Drawing.

396
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,619
Drawing...

397
00:47:56,879 --> 00:48:00,174
- what's so secret about drawing?
- I'm not supposed to.

398
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,757
You're not supposed to draw?

399
00:48:03,854 --> 00:48:08,011
- Who says? Isaac?
- Malachai.

400
00:48:08,622 --> 00:48:10,345
Malachai?

401
00:48:11,758 --> 00:48:14,791
Why don't you draw me a picture
we won't tell Isaac...

402
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:16,845
or Malachai
or anybody?

403
00:48:17,006 --> 00:48:18,893
- How's that sound?
- Okay.

404
00:51:29,709 --> 00:51:32,524
- How's it coming?
- Fine.

405
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:36,651
- What did you draw?
- You.

406
00:51:37,134 --> 00:51:39,687
You did?
Can I see?

407
00:51:49,262 --> 00:51:51,367
What is this?

408
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:54,604
Burt?

409
00:52:01,837 --> 00:52:03,561
Burt, is that you?

410
00:52:23,086 --> 00:52:24,231
Burt, is that you?

411
00:52:26,734 --> 00:52:28,295
Somebody here?

412
00:52:33,198 --> 00:52:34,791
Who are you?

413
00:52:36,046 --> 00:52:37,256
What do you want?

414
00:52:40,526 --> 00:52:43,014
We want to give you peace.

415
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:46,308
Seize her.

416
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,480
Come on! Get her!
Let's finish it!

417
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:01,572
No!
No!

418
00:53:27,342 --> 00:53:30,375
Burt!
Burt!

419
00:53:31,438 --> 00:53:34,918
Burt!
Burt!

420
00:53:37,389 --> 00:53:42,823
- Are we safe?
- Yes, it's weird here, but it's safe.

421
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,237
Help me!

422
00:53:56,206 --> 00:53:57,799
Where are you taking me?

423
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:02,179
Help!

424
00:54:03,246 --> 00:54:04,970
Help!

425
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:19,724
Vicky!

426
00:54:26,862 --> 00:54:28,967
Sarah, what happened here?

427
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:31,108
What happened?
Where's Vicky?

428
00:54:31,438 --> 00:54:33,031
You've gotta think.
Think.

429
00:54:33,421 --> 00:54:34,916
What happened to her?
Please!

430
00:54:39,374 --> 00:54:40,868
Does He speak to you, Isaac?

431
00:54:41,966 --> 00:54:45,894
He speaks to me always.
But today he's displeased.

432
00:54:46,413 --> 00:54:48,323
He's displeased with you,
Malachai.

433
00:54:48,621 --> 00:54:50,890
What have I done?

434
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:53,612
Question Him not in vain.

435
00:54:53,806 --> 00:54:56,708
Do you not know you sacrificed
Joseph without an offering?

436
00:54:57,069 --> 00:54:59,241
And did you not spill the blood
of the old man...

437
00:54:59,534 --> 00:55:02,022
when his oil and gasoline
were still useful to us?

438
00:55:02,254 --> 00:55:04,294
We have our own fuel now
from the corn.

439
00:55:04,589 --> 00:55:07,851
Sow not your pride, Malachai.
We have not enough.

440
00:55:10,286 --> 00:55:12,522
Maybe He's displeased
that we have not offered Him...

441
00:55:12,781 --> 00:55:16,043
- Sarah and Jobe.
- Sarah has the gift of sight.

442
00:55:16,461 --> 00:55:19,211
She warned us of the coming
of the interlopers.

443
00:55:19,726 --> 00:55:22,376
Question not my judgment,
Malachai.

444
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:25,037
I am the giver of His word.

445
00:55:28,141 --> 00:55:29,897
Go you and bring me the husband.

446
00:55:30,254 --> 00:55:32,905
We must offerthem tonight
when Amos leaves.

447
00:55:36,142 --> 00:55:38,509
Sarah, come on.
Tell me what happened to her.

448
00:55:39,886 --> 00:55:42,821
Look at me!
Think!

449
00:55:42,958 --> 00:55:45,543
- What?
- Malachai.

450
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:48,035
Who's Malachai?
What do you mean?

451
00:56:04,365 --> 00:56:05,642
Vicky?

452
00:56:11,693 --> 00:56:12,970
Vicky?

453
00:56:19,437 --> 00:56:20,747
Vicky?

454
00:57:12,877 --> 00:57:15,659
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

455
00:57:15,886 --> 00:57:18,984
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

456
00:57:19,214 --> 00:57:22,247
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

457
00:57:22,477 --> 00:57:24,517
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

458
00:57:24,718 --> 00:57:27,106
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

459
00:57:27,341 --> 00:57:30,276
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

460
00:57:30,509 --> 00:57:36,936
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

461
00:58:16,206 --> 00:58:18,856
Nowthe blood of Amos
will be shared.

462
00:58:20,077 --> 00:58:21,703
Stop it!
Stop that!

463
00:58:22,413 --> 00:58:23,842
Hold the outlander!

464
00:58:30,126 --> 00:58:31,686
What the hell is going on here?

465
00:58:33,229 --> 00:58:34,888
Are you crazy?
What do you think you're doing?

466
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:37,252
My passage.
It's my birthday.

467
00:58:37,486 --> 00:58:39,624
You've got a pretty sick way
of celebrating it, pal.

468
00:58:41,005 --> 00:58:43,144
Silence, interloper!

469
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:47,016
Your presence profanes
this holy place.

470
00:58:47,874 --> 00:58:50,688
- He will wreck with you.
- Great. I don't know who He is.

471
00:58:50,714 --> 00:58:53,081
Maybe He'd like to discuss
what's going on here with me.

472
00:58:53,402 --> 00:58:54,896
- It says it should be...
- Amos!

473
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:57,334
- It says it is written.
- Speak no more to him!

474
00:58:57,594 --> 00:59:00,823
He is an unbeliever.
Hurty, get Isaac!

475
00:59:01,113 --> 00:59:05,816
No! Wait!
Bring Malachai.

476
00:59:10,586 --> 00:59:13,488
What do you mean: "As it's
written? "Written where?

477
00:59:18,841 --> 00:59:20,532
What? In this?

478
00:59:21,402 --> 00:59:24,119
Are you rewriting the whole thing
orthe parts that suit your needs?

479
00:59:31,929 --> 00:59:34,231
- Back off!
- Sit down!

480
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:38,294
What do we have here?

481
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:41,881
Nineteen, eighteen...
What is this?

482
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:44,434
- These people died so young!
- Not died.

483
00:59:44,825 --> 00:59:47,859
We go to Him the first night
of our nineteenth year.

484
00:59:48,153 --> 00:59:49,233
Who the hell is Him?

485
00:59:49,465 --> 00:59:51,221
He Who Walks
Behind The Rows.

486
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:52,879
Malachai comes!

487
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:56,919
Seize him!

488
00:59:59,161 --> 01:00:00,722
Back off!

489
01:00:19,769 --> 01:00:22,387
Seize him.
Do not let him escape.

490
01:00:31,641 --> 01:00:35,351
Where is he?
Come on!

491
01:00:36,153 --> 01:00:39,699
There he is. Go get him!
You! Go that way!

492
01:00:59,417 --> 01:01:02,287
I need your help!
Come on!

493
01:01:02,489 --> 01:01:04,529
Come on, help me
Help me!

494
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:07,412
Outlander!
He's here.

495
01:01:20,505 --> 01:01:22,676
- Got you.
- This isn't a game.

496
01:01:22,937 --> 01:01:24,759
Back off!

497
01:01:30,521 --> 01:01:32,943
Outlander!

498
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:35,987
Go get him!

499
01:01:53,305 --> 01:01:54,483
Check the doors!
Check the doors!

500
01:02:00,921 --> 01:02:04,303
You guys go back to the alley.
You, overthere. You two follow me.

501
01:02:18,906 --> 01:02:20,215
Shit!

502
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:13,522
Damn it!

503
01:03:33,913 --> 01:03:35,288
Hey, mister!

504
01:03:36,473 --> 01:03:39,342
I know a place to hide.
But we gotta hurty.

505
01:03:39,673 --> 01:03:43,470
- Who are you?
- Jobe. Stop asking questions.

506
01:03:49,721 --> 01:03:50,768
Come on!

507
01:03:53,977 --> 01:03:55,733
Will you come on?

508
01:04:10,169 --> 01:04:11,445
Careful.

509
01:04:12,505 --> 01:04:14,327
Don't be a scared cat.

510
01:04:15,321 --> 01:04:18,703
- Come on. It's only me and Sarah.
- Sarah?

511
01:04:18,937 --> 01:04:20,792
Yes, my sister.

512
01:04:24,537 --> 01:04:25,944
Isn't that nice?

513
01:04:26,201 --> 01:04:27,216
My dad built it...

514
01:04:27,481 --> 01:04:29,586
when the communists launched
theirfirst strike.

515
01:04:31,673 --> 01:04:34,095
I don't think it's the communists
we have to worty about.

516
01:04:34,553 --> 01:04:37,270
Don't worty.
Nobody knows about this place.

517
01:04:38,777 --> 01:04:40,053
It's secret.

518
01:04:40,537 --> 01:04:42,479
- Those guys are friends of yours?
- No way!

519
01:04:43,258 --> 01:04:45,013
They listen to Isaac
and Malachai.

520
01:04:45,369 --> 01:04:49,112
- Who are Isaac and Malachai?
- Isaac started the whole thing.

521
01:04:49,625 --> 01:04:52,047
If he hadn't come,
this would never have happened.

522
01:04:52,313 --> 01:04:54,101
When he was young,
he was a preacher...

523
01:04:54,297 --> 01:04:55,759
so evetybody believed him.

524
01:04:55,993 --> 01:04:57,848
They thought he had
a great spirit.

525
01:04:58,489 --> 01:05:00,212
I thought he was weird.

526
01:05:11,033 --> 01:05:13,073
We must sacrifice
them both tonight.

527
01:05:13,497 --> 01:05:16,082
Amos will satisfy Him.
We need the woman.

528
01:05:16,281 --> 01:05:18,354
- She'll bring the man to us.
- No.

529
01:05:18,585 --> 01:05:20,276
He must be taken
without her.

530
01:05:20,505 --> 01:05:22,839
We cannot remove her
from this place. It is holy.

531
01:05:23,129 --> 01:05:25,846
We'll bring the Lord two
by using one.

532
01:05:26,073 --> 01:05:27,502
Do not blaspheme, Malachai.

533
01:05:27,769 --> 01:05:30,551
You know not the laws.
He speaks them only to me.

534
01:05:30,777 --> 01:05:31,955
I think not, Isaac.

535
01:05:32,185 --> 01:05:33,941
You are the one who's lost
favor with Him.

536
01:05:34,169 --> 01:05:36,951
He's a God of blood
and sacrifice, not ceremonies.

537
01:05:37,145 --> 01:05:39,894
Sacrilege!
Down on your knees, heretic!

538
01:05:40,089 --> 01:05:43,188
Shut your mouth, Isaac!
You've grown proud farfrom us.

539
01:05:45,625 --> 01:05:48,560
He Who Walks Behind The Rows
will decide yourfate.

540
01:05:49,177 --> 01:05:52,210
Don't you sit there, seize him!
Punish him, cut him down.

541
01:05:52,409 --> 01:05:53,936
I command you!

542
01:05:54,169 --> 01:05:56,340
I am the word and the giver
of His laws.

543
01:05:56,537 --> 01:05:58,741
Disobedience to me
is disobedience to Him.

544
01:05:59,097 --> 01:06:01,170
Do it now oryour punishment
will be a thousand times...

545
01:06:01,433 --> 01:06:04,367
a thousand deaths, each more
horrible than the last.

546
01:06:04,569 --> 01:06:07,438
They're tired of yourtalk.
I've showed them what I can do.

547
01:06:07,737 --> 01:06:11,447
Cut the woman down.
Put Isaac in her place.

548
01:06:11,705 --> 01:06:14,225
We'll see howthe Lord
favors you.

549
01:06:14,489 --> 01:06:16,147
Dare not to blaspheme.

550
01:06:16,377 --> 01:06:18,417
He will punish you.
The God of hell will devouryou.

551
01:06:18,713 --> 01:06:20,022
All of you!

552
01:06:20,313 --> 01:06:24,721
No! No!
No! No!

553
01:06:25,241 --> 01:06:29,518
When my dad wouldn't get up
I ran from Hansen...

554
01:06:29,881 --> 01:06:32,117
to get Officer Hodgekiss.
But it was too late.

555
01:06:32,377 --> 01:06:33,719
Why?
What happened to him?

556
01:06:33,945 --> 01:06:35,920
He got away at that time.

557
01:06:36,121 --> 01:06:38,674
He went to the barn
after he talked to the minister.

558
01:06:38,937 --> 01:06:40,311
Minister?

559
01:06:40,537 --> 01:06:43,438
- What happened to the minister?
- Malachai.

560
01:06:45,913 --> 01:06:48,499
Outlander!

561
01:06:50,265 --> 01:06:51,759
Outlander!

562
01:06:53,561 --> 01:06:55,383
You, overthere.
He's coming.

563
01:06:55,801 --> 01:06:57,492
You, overthere.

564
01:06:57,753 --> 01:06:59,412
Outlander!

565
01:07:02,553 --> 01:07:04,463
Outlander!

566
01:07:04,761 --> 01:07:08,143
We have your woman.
She still lives.

567
01:07:09,881 --> 01:07:12,947
Outlander!
Maybe you don't hear so well.

568
01:07:16,377 --> 01:07:20,119
Her blood will spill
unless you give yourself up.

569
01:07:20,346 --> 01:07:23,095
We won't wait much longer.

570
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:26,772
The night is coming.
Night is His time.

571
01:07:27,225 --> 01:07:29,843
Outlander!
Come on!

572
01:07:30,105 --> 01:07:32,788
Come on, outlander!

573
01:07:42,393 --> 01:07:44,400
Are you looking forthat lady?

574
01:07:44,729 --> 01:07:47,314
- Yes, you know where she is?
- They took her out to the clearing.

575
01:07:47,545 --> 01:07:49,846
- What clearing? Where?
- In the corn field.

576
01:07:50,393 --> 01:07:53,328
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

577
01:07:53,561 --> 01:07:55,317
I followed them,
just like I followed you.

578
01:07:55,545 --> 01:07:56,527
Show me.

579
01:07:57,944 --> 01:08:00,562
- Okay.
- Come on, let's go.

580
01:08:00,793 --> 01:08:02,167
Okay.

581
01:08:06,136 --> 01:08:07,446
Quiet.

582
01:08:11,225 --> 01:08:12,153
Come on.

583
01:08:14,233 --> 01:08:15,826
Follow me to the barn.

584
01:08:17,209 --> 01:08:18,419
Careful.

585
01:08:30,937 --> 01:08:33,457
I'm ready to celebrate
my birthday.

586
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:35,663
Malachai!
He will not forgive you.

587
01:08:35,961 --> 01:08:39,539
None of you will be forgiven.
All of you shall feel His wrath!

588
01:08:39,833 --> 01:08:42,134
We have a surprise foryou,
Amos.

589
01:08:42,649 --> 01:08:46,195
Isaac is gonna keep you company.

590
01:08:46,649 --> 01:08:50,445
I am the word
and the giver of His laws.

591
01:08:50,809 --> 01:08:52,402
This is the end!

592
01:09:19,385 --> 01:09:20,400
Come on.

593
01:09:25,785 --> 01:09:26,832
Over here.

594
01:09:29,401 --> 01:09:31,256
You can see evetything from here.

595
01:09:39,769 --> 01:09:40,979
Okay, you two...

596
01:09:41,265 --> 01:09:43,120
you stay here and wait for me.
All right?

597
01:09:43,313 --> 01:09:45,200
But if anything happens to me...

598
01:09:45,457 --> 01:09:48,108
you get to Hemingford
as fast as you can.

599
01:09:48,401 --> 01:09:51,367
You get on that road
and don't get off it. Understand?

600
01:09:59,953 --> 01:10:02,124
Go past the irrigation pump.

601
01:10:39,121 --> 01:10:40,495
It's Him.

602
01:10:42,928 --> 01:10:44,652
He's come for me.

603
01:10:46,768 --> 01:10:47,946
He's come for me.

604
01:10:50,928 --> 01:10:52,717
He's come to welcome me.

605
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,855
I'm here, Lord.

606
01:11:04,689 --> 01:11:07,504
I'm here, Lord.

607
01:11:08,592 --> 01:11:10,415
I'm ready.

608
01:11:11,313 --> 01:11:13,135
Take me now, Lord.

609
01:11:15,408 --> 01:11:18,791
Your will, Lord.
My passage.

610
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:38,991
I did it right.
I swear it.

611
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,571
I swear it.

612
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:47,016
I did evetything You wanted!

613
01:11:51,536 --> 01:11:54,122
No! No!

614
01:11:59,057 --> 01:12:02,188
Stop!

615
01:12:13,328 --> 01:12:14,987
Vicky, come on,
run to the barn!

616
01:12:18,865 --> 01:12:21,167
He hit Malachai!

617
01:12:22,993 --> 01:12:25,862
- Seize him.
- Take that.

618
01:12:26,609 --> 01:12:28,332
Vicky, get out of here!

619
01:12:28,784 --> 01:12:30,607
Was it like that with your
parents? Was it?

620
01:12:33,424 --> 01:12:35,912
Just because some suck
proclaims himself a holy man...

621
01:12:36,177 --> 01:12:38,064
and says God commands?

622
01:12:39,089 --> 01:12:42,885
What kind of God tells children
to kill their parents?

623
01:12:43,153 --> 01:12:44,560
Answer me that, buddy.

624
01:12:45,233 --> 01:12:47,950
Did you hearthat
before Isaac? Did you?

625
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,658
I can't believe
you're this blind.

626
01:12:54,544 --> 01:12:56,748
Maybe you've been listening
to this holy roller so long...

627
01:12:58,193 --> 01:13:01,324
that all starts to sound the same.
But it's not!

628
01:13:01,936 --> 01:13:07,087
Any religion without love
and compassion is false.

629
01:13:08,049 --> 01:13:09,423
It's a lie!

630
01:13:47,537 --> 01:13:49,031
Is he dead?

631
01:13:53,073 --> 01:13:54,633
Is this what you want?

632
01:13:56,304 --> 01:13:57,734
Is it what He commands?

633
01:14:07,729 --> 01:14:09,256
I don't think so.

634
01:14:09,969 --> 01:14:11,343
Get him!

635
01:14:12,497 --> 01:14:13,839
Stop him!

636
01:14:14,673 --> 01:14:16,102
Kill him!

637
01:14:17,169 --> 01:14:19,470
Malachai!

638
01:14:25,361 --> 01:14:29,070
He wants you too, Malachai.

639
01:14:33,361 --> 01:14:35,946
He wants you too.

640
01:15:12,528 --> 01:15:15,627
- Vicky?
- Burt? Over here!

641
01:15:16,592 --> 01:15:18,349
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

642
01:15:22,545 --> 01:15:24,487
Get down.

643
01:15:24,945 --> 01:15:26,887
Get some help and get
those doors closed. Quick.

644
01:15:27,952 --> 01:15:29,359
Rudolf, Robert, come on!

645
01:15:29,585 --> 01:15:31,624
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

646
01:15:32,113 --> 01:15:33,803
If I knew what it was,
I could tell you.

647
01:15:34,064 --> 01:15:36,399
It's He Who Walks
Behind The Rows.

648
01:15:36,721 --> 01:15:39,176
What if we tried to make it
to the road?

649
01:15:39,696 --> 01:15:41,606
I think we're safer here,
for now.

650
01:15:46,512 --> 01:15:49,382
Has anybody evertried
to hurt the monster?

651
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:51,753
Any of the adults, your parents
before they were killed?

652
01:15:51,985 --> 01:15:53,195
The Blue Man!

653
01:15:53,393 --> 01:15:55,083
Who is the Blue Man?
What did he do?

654
01:15:55,313 --> 01:15:57,168
Officer Hodgekiss.
I told you.

655
01:15:57,393 --> 01:16:00,011
He came down here
after he talked to the minister.

656
01:16:00,305 --> 01:16:02,476
He was reading a page
torn out from the Bible...

657
01:16:02,833 --> 01:16:05,200
and it was working
with distil.

658
01:16:08,497 --> 01:16:09,390
What was he reading
at the Bible?

659
01:16:09,552 --> 01:16:10,982
What was it?
Do you know?

660
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,553
You have it?
Hurty up. Where is it?

661
01:16:17,936 --> 01:16:19,365
"And the devil
that deceived them...

662
01:16:19,569 --> 01:16:21,936
was cast into the lake of fire
and sulphur.

663
01:16:22,384 --> 01:16:25,483
Where the beast and the false
prophet shall be tormented...

664
01:16:25,712 --> 01:16:28,298
day and night,
for ever and ever."

665
01:16:28,497 --> 01:16:29,925
What's that supposed to mean?

666
01:16:35,344 --> 01:16:38,540
What was the Blue Man
doing at the distil?

667
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,703
He hooked the hose
and he was ttying to roll it out.

668
01:16:42,064 --> 01:16:44,715
- What stopped him?
- Malachai.

669
01:16:45,072 --> 01:16:48,301
Lake of fire. Fire!
He was gonna burn the field.

670
01:16:49,585 --> 01:16:52,170
Oh, yes.
The alcohol from the distil.

671
01:16:52,368 --> 01:16:54,473
- How?
- Never mind, never mind.

672
01:16:55,024 --> 01:16:57,261
Kids, you bring me as many hoses
as you can find. Quick!

673
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:01,007
Jobie and Sarah. Find me a bottle.
Aglass bottle.

674
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:02,826
Quick!
Move!

675
01:17:04,144 --> 01:17:05,421
Vicky, come here!

676
01:17:11,696 --> 01:17:13,191
Over here!

677
01:17:14,576 --> 01:17:16,038
It doesn't fit.

678
01:17:16,432 --> 01:17:18,221
There's gotta be a connector
here somewhere.

679
01:17:19,408 --> 01:17:21,350
Tty this.

680
01:17:33,616 --> 01:17:35,471
Get somebody
to hold this on tight.

681
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:39,816
- Okay.
- Hang on to it. You got one. Good!

682
01:17:42,576 --> 01:17:45,708
Vicky, see if you can find me
a thick rag.

683
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:47,819
Jobie, come here.

684
01:17:49,457 --> 01:17:50,918
Hey, this is not a rag.

685
01:17:56,688 --> 01:17:59,950
Get them to hold on that tight.

686
01:18:01,233 --> 01:18:02,607
Open it up when I get there.
All right?

687
01:18:02,737 --> 01:18:03,947
All right.

688
01:18:05,232 --> 01:18:06,508
Be careful.

689
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,385
I love you, Vicky.

690
01:19:06,352 --> 01:19:07,759
What are you doing here?

691
01:19:08,017 --> 01:19:09,991
Get back to the barn.
Hurty up!

692
01:19:10,416 --> 01:19:11,364
Go on!

693
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,135
Move! Now!

694
01:19:18,704 --> 01:19:20,078
Excuse me!

695
01:19:39,536 --> 01:19:42,253
Get that valve. Quick.

696
01:19:52,976 --> 01:19:55,431
Do you know howto run
this thing?

697
01:19:55,696 --> 01:19:57,354
- Crank it!
- What?

698
01:19:57,552 --> 01:19:59,275
Crank it.

699
01:20:07,824 --> 01:20:09,864
Push the button at the top.

700
01:20:10,864 --> 01:20:12,075
Now!

701
01:20:52,432 --> 01:20:55,247
- Get the bottle!
- Okay!

702
01:21:09,551 --> 01:21:10,894
Jobie!

703
01:21:11,568 --> 01:21:13,226
Come back here!

704
01:21:23,216 --> 01:21:24,710
Jobie!

705
01:21:32,144 --> 01:21:34,795
Run, come on, run!

706
01:21:34,992 --> 01:21:38,091
- Jobie!
- Here's the bottle!

707
01:21:41,008 --> 01:21:43,975
Throw it!
It's the right time!

708
01:21:44,272 --> 01:21:45,865
Throw it!
Throw it!

709
01:22:05,232 --> 01:22:06,344
Burt!

710
01:22:12,016 --> 01:22:12,747
Jobie!

711
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,666
Burt!

712
01:22:15,184 --> 01:22:16,940
Jobie!

713
01:22:18,288 --> 01:22:19,717
- Vicky!
- Sarah!

714
01:22:21,745 --> 01:22:24,046
Jobie!
Jobie!

715
01:22:30,416 --> 01:22:31,594
Look!

716
01:22:45,424 --> 01:22:46,951
Come on! Come on!
Let's go!

717
01:22:59,633 --> 01:23:02,599
- Is he dead?
- I think so.

718
01:23:03,695 --> 01:23:05,354
Then why are we still running?

719
01:23:05,552 --> 01:23:08,454
- Just keep going!
- Where did you get this guy?

720
01:23:36,592 --> 01:23:39,341
Hemingford is 19 miles
right?

721
01:23:39,759 --> 01:23:43,720
- We'll walk?
- Sure.

722
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,763
Are you sure
you're strong enough?

723
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:51,880
I'm okay. And you?
Are you okay?

724
01:23:52,048 --> 01:23:54,666
I'll make it.
I got a great doctor.

725
01:24:05,008 --> 01:24:06,318
Jealous?

726
01:24:07,407 --> 01:24:09,677
So what do we do with these
two little kids?

727
01:24:10,383 --> 01:24:11,660
I don't know.

728
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,862
You guys wanna stay with us
for a couple of days?

729
01:24:15,792 --> 01:24:17,253
How about a week?

730
01:24:18,928 --> 01:24:20,684
Okay.

731
01:24:21,136 --> 01:24:22,827
- How about a month?
- No.

732
01:24:24,016 --> 01:24:27,693
All right. All right.
I'll grab the map.

733
01:24:28,431 --> 01:24:31,727
- Interloper! No!
- God!

734
01:24:37,552 --> 01:24:38,829
You must die!

735
01:24:43,312 --> 01:24:44,294
Oh, boy!

736
01:24:52,976 --> 01:24:54,437
She's out cold.

737
01:24:55,407 --> 01:24:57,098
What are we gonna do now?

738
01:24:57,456 --> 01:25:00,773
Send her a card from Seattle.
Let's get out of here.
