1
00:00:42,938 --> 00:00:45,530
That may just be baby talk,
but, Stan...

2
00:00:45,696 --> 00:00:48,670
...look at them and tell me
they're not communicating.

3
00:00:48,839 --> 00:00:50,949
Honey, this is a big day.

4
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:55,020
When you're in business with Biscane
Broadcasting, you've hit the big time.

5
00:00:55,191 --> 00:00:58,165
- Hello?
- Honey, did you hear anything I said?

6
00:00:58,334 --> 00:01:01,123
- Yes, of course I heard you.
- What did I say?

7
00:01:01,285 --> 00:01:02,783
What'd you say?

8
00:01:02,953 --> 00:01:06,310
I said, don't you think
the babies are communicating?

9
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:09,237
Honey, where's my jacket?

10
00:01:09,399 --> 00:01:13,118
Hello. Yeah.
Hi, is this Biscane Broadcasting?

11
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:15,195
Hi, this is Stan Bobbins.

12
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,289
No, not Dan. Stan.

13
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:28,641
Oh, and those World War II
rescue missions?

14
00:01:30,955 --> 00:01:32,781
What kind of milk you drinking?

15
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,076
- What?
- A baby...

16
00:01:36,246 --> 00:01:38,291
...who can perform
superhuman feats...

17
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,019
...communicate to both
babies and adults...

18
00:01:41,186 --> 00:01:43,264
...and defend the children
of the world.

19
00:01:43,431 --> 00:01:47,532
That creates a paradox
which defies rational elucidation.

20
00:01:47,697 --> 00:01:49,294
In English, Finkleman.

21
00:01:52,573 --> 00:01:54,487
I think he's saying
you're full of...

22
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,602
- Sorry.
- What kind of milk you drinking, Alex?

23
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,612
And you're trying to tell us...

24
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:07,573
...that this Kahuna is related to both
you and your cousins Sly and Whit?

25
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:11,331
Oh, whoa. Wait a minute.
What don't you understand?

26
00:02:11,497 --> 00:02:14,351
Look, sit back and let me
tell you another story...

27
00:02:14,513 --> 00:02:18,712
...about the legendary Kahuna
and his archenemy, Captain Kane.

28
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:23,326
This one happened
a long, long time ago...

29
00:02:23,493 --> 00:02:25,352
...in East Berlin in 1962.

30
00:02:25,893 --> 00:02:28,233
You know, the Berlin Wall
and all that stuff?

31
00:02:45,074 --> 00:02:47,983
Now, we've heard
about all kinds of superheroes.

32
00:02:48,154 --> 00:02:52,156
Superman, Superwoman,
Superthis, Superthat.

33
00:02:52,323 --> 00:02:55,811
And they always do super things
and save everybody.

34
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,440
But this is the story
of a real superhero...

35
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,781
...a little boy who looks
after the children of the world.

36
00:03:02,298 --> 00:03:04,125
All the children.

37
00:03:05,763 --> 00:03:06,976
Showtime.

38
00:03:18,336 --> 00:03:21,639
Locking in four-wheel drive.

39
00:03:43,226 --> 00:03:46,912
Kahuna's archenemy, Captain Kane,
had dreams of controlling the world.

40
00:03:48,903 --> 00:03:50,696
And he did all kinds
of bad things.

41
00:03:51,662 --> 00:03:53,674
- My dear Petrov.
- Captain Kane.

42
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:57,621
Always a pleasure to see you.

43
00:03:58,526 --> 00:04:02,244
- To our work.
- To our work.

44
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,421
It's wonderful what you do here,
saving orphaned children.

45
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:16,294
I have a soft spot
for the gentle laughter of babies.

46
00:04:23,127 --> 00:04:26,748
Kane knew if he could control
children, he could control the world.

47
00:04:26,913 --> 00:04:30,237
He captured children trying
to escape through the Berlin Wall...

48
00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:33,613
...and sent them to his secret
camps all over East Germany.

49
00:04:44,522 --> 00:04:46,632
Capturing orphaned children?

50
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:50,670
If you think the Kahuna was
about to let Kane get away with that...

51
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,371
...think again.

52
00:04:54,786 --> 00:04:58,406
If there were ever children who
needed his help, these were them.

53
00:04:58,571 --> 00:05:00,911
I'm scared, Peter.

54
00:05:01,072 --> 00:05:04,856
It's okay, Greta.
We'll find a way out of this.

55
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:18,521
That could've hurt someone.

56
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,881
- It's a boy.
- It's a boy?

57
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,293
- It's what?
- Who're you?

58
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:32,663
Name's Kahuna,
and I'm busting you kids out of here.

59
00:05:32,827 --> 00:05:36,184
He's saving us. He's saving us.

60
00:05:36,355 --> 00:05:37,765
All right, let's go.

61
00:05:46,812 --> 00:05:50,136
This tunnel leads to the courtyard
of the U.S. Embassy.

62
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:53,381
Go straight to Ambassador Clark.
Tell him Kahuna sent you.

63
00:05:54,285 --> 00:05:57,161
- Thank you, Mr. Kahuna.
- Just doing my job, miss.

64
00:05:57,332 --> 00:06:00,820
- Greta, hurry.
- You did good, kid.

65
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,523
Good luck.

66
00:06:02,913 --> 00:06:05,855
Mobilize every soldier
in the compound...

67
00:06:06,025 --> 00:06:06,088
...and secure the perimeter.
Kahuna must not escape.

68
00:06:06,088 --> 00:06:09,512
...and secure the perimeter.
Kahuna must not escape.

69
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:13,235
Search this building.
All sectors.

70
00:06:13,402 --> 00:06:17,120
Sergeant, send four units
ahead to the Wall.

71
00:06:18,053 --> 00:06:21,836
Seal off the compound.
Find those brats. I want Kahuna.

72
00:06:21,998 --> 00:06:26,383
Hey, prissy pants, don't wet
yourself. I'm right here.

73
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,557
So we meet again...

74
00:06:30,338 --> 00:06:33,575
...my little archenemy.
- You better watch it, Kane.

75
00:06:33,737 --> 00:06:37,127
- Those things'll kill you.
- And those things...

76
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,345
...will give you cavities.

77
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,492
That's okay,
I've still got my baby teeth.

78
00:06:42,654 --> 00:06:45,180
It's the end of the road for you.

79
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:51,242
- Don't I get one last word?
- That's a little cliché, don't you think?

80
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,324
But I'm intrigued.

81
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,222
What is your last word?

82
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:57,792
Duck.

83
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:02,088
"Duck" is your last word?
"Duck."

84
00:07:06,486 --> 00:07:07,984
Duck!

85
00:07:10,688 --> 00:07:14,527
My leg. His machine
has damaged my leg.

86
00:07:15,082 --> 00:07:16,492
Get him!

87
00:07:16,654 --> 00:07:18,513
- What are you waiting for?
- Bottle!

88
00:07:19,476 --> 00:07:21,106
Get him before he...

89
00:07:23,294 --> 00:07:26,650
No! Too late.

90
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:34,610
You see? You see?

91
00:07:34,905 --> 00:07:37,497
I told you. It's too late.

92
00:07:37,663 --> 00:07:40,452
Now it's over. No.

93
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:44,681
Look at that. I warned you.

94
00:07:44,848 --> 00:07:46,958
It's playtime.

95
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:52,510
One potato, two potato,
three potato, four.

96
00:07:52,674 --> 00:07:55,135
Five potato, six potato,
seven potato, more.

97
00:07:55,465 --> 00:07:58,221
Didn't your mothers tell you
not to play with guns?

98
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:22,115
I'll do it.

99
00:08:23,081 --> 00:08:24,513
I'll finish you off.

100
00:08:28,631 --> 00:08:34,755
One day I will be... I will destroy
you if it takes me forever.

101
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:38,341
And then Kahuna utilized
his turbojet propulsion...

102
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:41,616
...and jumped that Mustang
right over the Berlin Wall.

103
00:08:41,781 --> 00:08:44,657
A Mustang G T at the Berlin Wall...

104
00:08:44,828 --> 00:08:48,732
...back in the '60s?
- Man, you tripping, Archie.

105
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,937
That's how the Kahuna saved
the orphans of East Berlin.

106
00:08:53,104 --> 00:08:55,378
Any questions? Rosita?

107
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,203
Still not convinced, Finkleman?

108
00:08:57,369 --> 00:09:00,956
Cool it, Archie. It's your mom
and dad. Act like babies.

109
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:08,526
- Somebody pick up the phone.
- Are you having a good day?

110
00:09:08,692 --> 00:09:10,672
- Is that Daniel and Jasmine?
- Jean, l...

111
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,400
- Hi, guys.
- I don't know why you're opposed.

112
00:09:13,568 --> 00:09:15,613
This will put Bobbins' World
on the map.

113
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:19,401
Allowing a huge satellite
network access to this facility...

114
00:09:19,566 --> 00:09:21,840
...and using kids
as marketing subjects...

115
00:09:22,003 --> 00:09:25,175
...it's everything we stand against.
- It's about marketing.

116
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:27,931
Bobbins' World will be
the McDonald's of daycare.

117
00:09:28,098 --> 00:09:30,788
Great. We'll be known as McBaby.

118
00:09:30,952 --> 00:09:33,959
Honey, this is new territory for you...

119
00:09:34,128 --> 00:09:36,107
...maybe you should talk
to Dan first.

120
00:09:36,277 --> 00:09:39,897
He's out of the country working
for UNICEF.

121
00:09:40,061 --> 00:09:43,068
Besides, I'm running
Bobbins' World now. Okay?

122
00:09:43,237 --> 00:09:46,726
I don't need to run to big brother Dan,
the baby guru, for help.

123
00:09:46,894 --> 00:09:50,218
Archie's father could give him
a bit more attention sometimes.

124
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:55,551
Who needs that junk? Better he learn
up-front that it's a cold, cruel world...

125
00:09:55,714 --> 00:09:59,520
...and you gotta tough it out on your
own. Heck, I don't need nobody.

126
00:09:59,788 --> 00:10:02,314
Ever consider sensitivity training?

127
00:10:03,701 --> 00:10:06,457
I am gonna... Okay, I am
gonna turn Bobbins' World...

128
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,889
...into the biggest chain
of daycare centers in the world.

129
00:10:11,335 --> 00:10:16,235
Man, I'm hungry. Yo, Mrs. B,
girl needs a snack!

130
00:10:16,756 --> 00:10:21,469
For the last time, Rosita, the adults
don't understand our language.

131
00:10:21,631 --> 00:10:23,938
To attract their attention,
one must speak...

132
00:10:24,101 --> 00:10:26,922
...in the only baby language
they seem to comprehend.

133
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,680
Which is?

134
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,131
Oh, yeah. Crying.

135
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,892
Here we go.

136
00:10:39,176 --> 00:10:42,183
I need to ask you a question
about the big-screen monitor.

137
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:45,840
Honey the kids are hungry.
Michelle, bring some bottles.

138
00:10:46,008 --> 00:10:48,982
Sharon, can you get some bottles
here? Thank goodness.

139
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:49,529
Works every time.

140
00:11:08,358 --> 00:11:11,365
My leg. This leg
is always killing me.

141
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:15,286
- Tell them to get away.
- Not now.

142
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,276
Mr. Biscane, Mr. Bobbins.

143
00:11:21,445 --> 00:11:23,753
- Pleasure.
- Dan?

144
00:11:23,915 --> 00:11:26,091
It's Stan.

145
00:11:29,849 --> 00:11:31,676
He likes you.

146
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:37,478
I like him.

147
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:41,323
Okay, sweeties,
today is Wednesday...

148
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:45,725
...which means we have
a very special guest for storytime.

149
00:11:45,886 --> 00:11:49,408
That's right, kiddies.
My name's Kylie, sweetheart. Hey.

150
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:53,960
I don't like to brag about her, even
though she is an honor student...

151
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:58,777
...the most beautiful girl in school and
the president of the literature club.

152
00:11:58,941 --> 00:12:02,527
Oh, Archie. Come on.
Come on, Finkie. Come and sit down.

153
00:12:02,694 --> 00:12:05,187
We are gonna read
about Cinderella.

154
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:09,386
Once upon a time, a lovely
young girl named Cinderella...

155
00:12:09,686 --> 00:12:13,590
...lived in a grand mansion with
her stepmother and two stepsisters.

156
00:12:14,273 --> 00:12:19,370
Kylie reads with passion. The words
literally dance right off the page.

157
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:25,109
- Looks like someone's in love.
- Peasant.

158
00:12:25,531 --> 00:12:29,151
Finkleman and Kylie
Sitting in a tree

159
00:12:29,317 --> 00:12:32,805
K-l-S-S-l-N-G

160
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:35,661
Knock it off, you mugs.
The lady's trying to work.

161
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,159
What are you guys
blabbering about?

162
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,534
Oh, they're not babbling.
They're talking.

163
00:12:41,697 --> 00:12:45,054
I just wish we could understand
what they're talking about.

164
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:50,580
Mr. Bill Biscane.

165
00:12:50,806 --> 00:12:53,977
The chairman of Biscane
Satellite Systems.

166
00:12:54,142 --> 00:12:57,762
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

167
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:02,126
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

168
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:06,391
We are here to celebrate the future.

169
00:13:07,555 --> 00:13:11,076
Not a future of flying cars
and spaceships.

170
00:13:11,244 --> 00:13:16,111
The real future is in the hands
of one group. Our children.

171
00:13:16,274 --> 00:13:20,112
I have a soft spot for
the gentle laughter of babies.

172
00:13:21,374 --> 00:13:24,349
- What did he say?
- And so it is my greatest pleasure...

173
00:13:24,646 --> 00:13:27,850
...to announce the launch
of the largest children's network...

174
00:13:28,238 --> 00:13:31,245
...in television history.
It will be delivered...

175
00:13:31,414 --> 00:13:35,198
...via the new Biscane Telespace
3000 Satellite.

176
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,876
And we call this network
Kidz Everywhere.

177
00:13:40,715 --> 00:13:45,134
We will take input from the children
themselves, making this the first...

178
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:49,019
...true interactive network
by kids for kids.

179
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,523
- It's him. It's Biscane.
- Sadly...

180
00:13:51,685 --> 00:13:54,408
...Dan Bobbins
cannot be here with us.

181
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:56,846
We have, on behalf
of Bobbins' World...

182
00:13:57,009 --> 00:14:00,366
...Dan Bobbins' half brother,
Stanley.

183
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:02,584
Mr. Bobbins?

184
00:14:06,215 --> 00:14:09,484
- I'm his real brother.
- Doesn't matter.

185
00:14:13,656 --> 00:14:15,570
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

186
00:14:16,703 --> 00:14:19,907
This has been a dream of mine
for quite a while now and...

187
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:24,944
It's coming together now. I can finally
see your plan in all its magnificence...

188
00:14:25,107 --> 00:14:27,381
As I've told you
many times before...

189
00:14:27,545 --> 00:14:31,296
...I will win,
even if it takes forever.

190
00:14:31,619 --> 00:14:33,860
That's Captain Kane,
from Berlin.

191
00:14:34,024 --> 00:14:38,190
Sweetie, what're you doing in here?
Looking out at all the exciting things?

192
00:14:38,355 --> 00:14:40,662
You should get
with the other kids. Yeah.

193
00:14:40,824 --> 00:14:43,798
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I may have your attention...

194
00:14:49,163 --> 00:14:53,231
Oh, my gosh, guys.
Biscane. I think he's Kane!

195
00:14:53,398 --> 00:14:57,051
Sometimes, Archie, I think all you
do is blurt out the first thing...

196
00:14:57,214 --> 00:14:59,970
...that pops into your mind.
- I'm not a brain baby.

197
00:15:00,134 --> 00:15:03,687
I'm a baby of action.
All right, maybe it's not him.

198
00:15:03,854 --> 00:15:06,763
Anyway, Biscane, I don't like him.

199
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:09,809
What are we gonna do
about this Biscane?

200
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,086
- No fear, Finkie's here.
- Quentin Finkleman...

201
00:15:13,252 --> 00:15:17,900
...you're just the guy I'm looking for.
- Okay then, what's our plan this time?

202
00:15:19,122 --> 00:15:21,364
We're not supposed to be here.

203
00:15:22,137 --> 00:15:24,597
I'm getting sick to my stomach.

204
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:31,494
Okay, Finkleman, you're
the computer geek. Now what?

205
00:15:31,663 --> 00:15:36,048
- I prefer the term "computer artisan."
- Whatever.

206
00:15:36,218 --> 00:15:39,870
All right, all right.
Type in "Bill Biscane."

207
00:15:40,548 --> 00:15:43,490
Ignore the official sites
for Biscane Broadcasting...

208
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:47,180
...or anything like that.
There's usually some rogue ones.

209
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:49,042
You know, anti-corporate sites.

210
00:15:51,004 --> 00:15:53,563
- What's wrong with you, Finkleman?
- I feel faint.

211
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,005
- You're always scared.
- Look!

212
00:15:56,168 --> 00:15:58,760
See what it says up there?
Criminal!

213
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,233
Biscane. It says he's
a corporate criminal.

214
00:16:01,397 --> 00:16:04,753
Are you crazy?
That's just website spam.

215
00:16:10,891 --> 00:16:13,286
Red alert!
It's Biscane's flunkies!

216
00:16:13,457 --> 00:16:15,436
- What do we do?
- Run!

217
00:16:15,606 --> 00:16:18,515
- Come on, Fink.
- Wait, don't leave me!

218
00:16:21,668 --> 00:16:23,232
Oh, no!

219
00:16:30,713 --> 00:16:31,926
Come on.

220
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,497
This building wasn't up to code.

221
00:16:34,658 --> 00:16:36,703
- Meaning?
- I couldn't possibly do it...

222
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:39,299
You have until tomorrow
to do what's necessary.

223
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,099
- That's impossible.
- People.

224
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,858
We won't have a problem
with building inspectors.

225
00:16:44,024 --> 00:16:47,065
Mr. Biscane has paid
off thousands of petty bureaucrats...

226
00:16:47,232 --> 00:16:49,604
...from here to New York.

227
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:51,493
What have I done?

228
00:16:54,193 --> 00:16:56,205
- What was that?
- It's a baby.

229
00:16:56,502 --> 00:16:59,509
And he overheard
everything we said.

230
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:03,228
What's he gonna do,
call the FBI?

231
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:06,056
Get him. He knows something.

232
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,313
- Tell us what you know.
- Oh, no.

233
00:17:11,481 --> 00:17:12,913
Hey, pock face.

234
00:17:16,805 --> 00:17:20,228
It's him! It's the Kahuna!
I knew he'd come!

235
00:17:20,397 --> 00:17:23,252
- Pick on somebody half your size.
- I knew it.

236
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:29,214
Who the heck are you?

237
00:17:30,084 --> 00:17:34,055
Your worst nightmare.
A small fry with a big attitude.

238
00:17:36,285 --> 00:17:37,914
Have a seat.

239
00:17:43,052 --> 00:17:44,812
You a gambling man?

240
00:17:45,202 --> 00:17:48,625
Heads, I win. Tails, you lose.

241
00:17:48,794 --> 00:17:51,583
Heads, I win. Tails, you lose.

242
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,273
That was fun. But we gotta run.
See you.

243
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,743
- Find that brat.
- That was Kahuna.

244
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,987
I knew he'd come.

245
00:18:20,901 --> 00:18:23,143
That was Kahuna.

246
00:18:27,765 --> 00:18:31,668
- I'm sorry that we panicked.
- I thought for sure you'd be a goner.

247
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:34,015
Yeah, I was until
the Kahuna saved me.

248
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,610
Archie, this is getting serious.

249
00:18:38,028 --> 00:18:41,003
You believe me,
don't you, Rosita?

250
00:18:41,172 --> 00:18:44,408
I believe Kahuna
was with you, in spirit.

251
00:18:44,572 --> 00:18:47,448
You'd best have a talk
with your inner adult.

252
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:49,631
Inner adult.

253
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:53,548
- What about my computer?
- A new one will be here.

254
00:18:53,714 --> 00:18:56,054
- We'll take care of everything.
- A wig.

255
00:18:56,215 --> 00:18:58,938
That's gotta be Kahuna's disguise.

256
00:18:59,648 --> 00:19:03,169
The kids will be out of the way when
your men are working tomorrow.

257
00:19:03,336 --> 00:19:05,446
- Don't worry about that.
- Poor Archie.

258
00:19:05,774 --> 00:19:08,595
Yeah. He's got serious
abandonment issues.

259
00:19:08,757 --> 00:19:13,503
- We all have issues.
- Speak for yourself, brain boy.

260
00:19:13,664 --> 00:19:18,345
I just mean that you quite
possibly have aggression issues...

261
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:21,066
...which may be tied
to a theme of mistrust...

262
00:19:21,234 --> 00:19:24,854
...and, ultimately, fear of love.
- I don't have aggression issues.

263
00:19:26,013 --> 00:19:28,572
Don't make me pound
on you to prove it.

264
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,712
Okay, Mrs. Tyson,
don't bite my ear off.

265
00:19:32,974 --> 00:19:34,384
Brandon.

266
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:39,128
Brandon, thanks so much for
coming by. This is so cool of you.

267
00:19:39,292 --> 00:19:41,337
I was pretty sure
I know why you called.

268
00:19:41,505 --> 00:19:44,447
- So I got here right away.
- Okay, here it goes.

269
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,214
I know the guy usually asks...

270
00:19:47,504 --> 00:19:49,680
It's cool. I was gonna
ask you anyway.

271
00:19:49,844 --> 00:19:52,338
I mean, everyone knows
what a brainiac you are.

272
00:19:52,507 --> 00:19:55,066
- Even the coach said so.
- Brainiac?

273
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:59,144
You know, I've gotta, like, make
a C-average to play football.

274
00:19:59,307 --> 00:20:02,184
And I felt kind of weird asking
you to tutor me so...

275
00:20:02,354 --> 00:20:05,940
...I'm glad you're asking me first.
- Tutor you. Right.

276
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,303
- You don't have any plans, right?
- No. No plans.

277
00:20:11,367 --> 00:20:12,646
Cool.

278
00:20:16,371 --> 00:20:19,127
Jerk. I hate jocks.

279
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,516
Three thousand dollars for books.

280
00:20:26,314 --> 00:20:29,704
Uncle Stan, can I walk the kids
over to the children's museum?

281
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:33,396
No. Go ahead, Kylie.
They'll probably love it.

282
00:20:33,563 --> 00:20:35,061
Kylie?

283
00:20:35,295 --> 00:20:39,615
- Hey, you okay?
- I just need to get out for a while.

284
00:20:40,363 --> 00:20:43,633
- Nothing short of a miracle.
- That's what Biscane's paying for.

285
00:20:43,795 --> 00:20:46,168
Quit the jabbering,
give me the blooming disk.

286
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:48,669
- Thirty million dollars' worth.
- Try 60.

287
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,428
Look out.

288
00:20:52,455 --> 00:20:55,725
You got them?
God, that was close.

289
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,680
Stupid girl!

290
00:20:59,287 --> 00:21:00,720
Hope it's all right.

291
00:21:01,725 --> 00:21:04,251
- What?
- Nothing. Nothing.

292
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:08,291
Oh, my God, it's gone.
Without that disk, we're sunk.

293
00:21:08,717 --> 00:21:11,724
I could feel Kylie's heart shatter
into a million pieces.

294
00:21:11,893 --> 00:21:14,036
- Poor Kylie.
- Man, if that were me...

295
00:21:14,203 --> 00:21:16,346
...I would've popped him
in the kisser.

296
00:21:17,474 --> 00:21:19,366
We have a problem.

297
00:21:21,483 --> 00:21:23,758
Oh, no, I'm getting nauseous again.

298
00:21:34,218 --> 00:21:36,077
- Go on, mister.
- Go on.

299
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:42,995
Go on. What do you want?

300
00:21:50,025 --> 00:21:54,028
I don't know what's going on. We
gotta get out of here. Hold on, kids.

301
00:22:04,394 --> 00:22:07,303
Fasten your seatbelts.
This might be a bumpy ride.

302
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,152
What do you want?

303
00:22:26,718 --> 00:22:28,763
Leave us alone!

304
00:22:36,629 --> 00:22:37,580
- What...
- The...

305
00:22:37,752 --> 00:22:39,961
Heck?

306
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,590
It's the Kahuna.

307
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:56,513
Let's even the odds,
shall we, boys? Bottle up.

308
00:23:00,718 --> 00:23:02,730
It's the Kahuna!

309
00:23:03,572 --> 00:23:05,399
I told you he's real.

310
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:27,427
Oh, my God.

311
00:23:38,086 --> 00:23:39,616
I love him!

312
00:24:09,103 --> 00:24:11,082
It truly is the Kahuna.

313
00:24:16,672 --> 00:24:19,613
- Who are you? What are you?
- No time for small talk.

314
00:24:19,784 --> 00:24:24,584
- We gotta boogie, little lady.
- Boogie? Okay, but this is nuts.

315
00:24:38,194 --> 00:24:41,300
Scan engine specs.
Mold ignition key.

316
00:24:41,466 --> 00:24:45,217
- Okay, what is going on?
- Key ready.

317
00:24:45,379 --> 00:24:47,106
All right. Let's go.

318
00:24:47,272 --> 00:24:50,410
Warning: Objects in mirror
are stupider than they appear.

319
00:24:50,576 --> 00:24:52,336
Metal to the pedal.

320
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,376
Oops, forgot something.

321
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:57,176
No, I didn't.

322
00:24:57,439 --> 00:24:59,484
See you.
Wouldn't wanna be you.

323
00:25:05,394 --> 00:25:08,084
I will control the minds
of the children...

324
00:25:08,249 --> 00:25:10,710
...through their own television sets.

325
00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:15,396
A mind-control pulse will come
through Muggles the Frog.

326
00:25:15,561 --> 00:25:17,421
Muggles doesn't look like a frog.

327
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:20,623
He looks like a zucchini.
This is irritating.

328
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,517
As irritating as a...

329
00:25:24,864 --> 00:25:29,064
What is it, Crowe?
Good news, I hope?

330
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:33,996
The attempt to recover the disk...

331
00:25:36,443 --> 00:25:38,969
It was unsuccessful.

332
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:41,663
This is not good news.

333
00:25:43,018 --> 00:25:45,774
Where is the girl now?

334
00:25:45,937 --> 00:25:48,015
- She escaped.
- Escaped?

335
00:25:49,497 --> 00:25:53,084
- You're not going to believe this.
- Try me.

336
00:25:53,507 --> 00:25:57,410
My men report that
she was spirited away...

337
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:01,069
...by some sort of mini...
- Kahuna.

338
00:26:03,578 --> 00:26:05,557
Kahuna is here.

339
00:26:07,331 --> 00:26:10,787
- Suddenly I'm feeling weak.
- Let's sit down.

340
00:26:11,661 --> 00:26:14,001
- Sir.
- Get me something.

341
00:26:14,163 --> 00:26:17,072
- What can I get you, sir?
- Soda pop.

342
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,385
- Diet or regular?
- What's the difference?

343
00:26:19,552 --> 00:26:22,756
Feel my head. Is it hot?
Is it cold? Tell me the truth.

344
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:25,194
- You're perfectly normal.
- Normal?

345
00:26:25,357 --> 00:26:27,916
You're not a real doctor.
Where's my soda pop?

346
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:29,975
Get me my globe.

347
00:26:30,137 --> 00:26:34,139
I don't want this umbrella.
I'm a sick man.

348
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:44,313
Then you did a bunch of back flips,
then you waded in garbage cans...

349
00:26:44,474 --> 00:26:48,225
...and you kicked them. Then you put
that garbage can on the guy's head.

350
00:26:48,387 --> 00:26:52,652
And then you did karate moves.
And then you got them all tied up...

351
00:26:52,813 --> 00:26:54,990
...and then you spun them
around a bunch.

352
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:59,988
Then that guy tried to hit you, and
he hit the other goon by accident.

353
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,483
Then you knocked them down
and ran up that wall like Spider-Man.

354
00:27:03,912 --> 00:27:07,662
That was cool. You saved us.
And they were afraid of you.

355
00:27:07,825 --> 00:27:11,991
Those goons were afraid of you.
You saved us.

356
00:27:12,187 --> 00:27:16,223
We're related, you know. Part of the
Bobbins' World, along with my dad...

357
00:27:16,389 --> 00:27:21,135
...and my cousins Sly and Whit. I bet
I know why you're here. It's Biscane.

358
00:27:21,296 --> 00:27:23,604
- He's Kane.
- This has to be a dream.

359
00:27:23,766 --> 00:27:26,325
Your archenemy, right? I knew it.

360
00:27:26,492 --> 00:27:29,598
What's it like to have super
strengths and super gadgets...?

361
00:27:29,764 --> 00:27:32,453
Easy on the gummy bears.
The sugar's getting to you.

362
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:35,112
It was Biscane's men
who tried to nab you.

363
00:27:35,281 --> 00:27:38,070
My guess is, he's up to something
with Bobbins' World.

364
00:27:38,232 --> 00:27:42,584
All right, everybody, you can
relax now. You're safe here.

365
00:27:51,286 --> 00:27:55,419
Wow, this is totally off the hook.

366
00:27:58,182 --> 00:27:59,910
All aboard.

367
00:28:04,598 --> 00:28:08,021
- This is your ride?
- Welcome to my playground.

368
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,367
Wow.

369
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,819
Amazing.

370
00:28:18,967 --> 00:28:24,162
- My God.
- This is one bad Batcave.

371
00:28:26,377 --> 00:28:31,824
- Magnificent. A baby utopia.
- This place is the bomb.

372
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:35,511
It's my world of holograms. We can
create any dream you can dream.

373
00:28:35,678 --> 00:28:37,089
Send in the clowns.

374
00:28:45,461 --> 00:28:49,749
- Wow.
- What is this place?

375
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:53,635
- Wanna see my pets?
- Yeah. Cool.

376
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:06,237
- Oh, my God.
- Holograms make great watchdogs...

377
00:29:06,406 --> 00:29:08,801
...and you don't have to feed them.

378
00:29:10,223 --> 00:29:13,876
- Oh no, a bear. A bear.
- It's a bear.

379
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,636
A bear!

380
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:25,868
And now the king.

381
00:29:26,037 --> 00:29:29,043
Now, is he on a chain?
Tell me he's on a chain.

382
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,691
Come on, Fink, sing with me.

383
00:29:46,917 --> 00:29:50,438
- We're here.
- Wow.

384
00:29:53,011 --> 00:29:57,692
We're here. I have
to see this. Okay, Finkie.

385
00:29:57,854 --> 00:30:00,993
All ashore who's going ashore.

386
00:30:01,158 --> 00:30:03,236
Watch your step, Alex.

387
00:30:03,404 --> 00:30:05,613
- Off we go, Rosita.
- Kylie, me too.

388
00:30:05,777 --> 00:30:08,150
- Come on, Arch.
- Hey, Archie, come over here.

389
00:30:08,311 --> 00:30:10,870
- Wait for me.
- This is cool.

390
00:30:11,326 --> 00:30:14,180
Go take a look around.
You won't believe what you see.

391
00:30:14,341 --> 00:30:16,736
How come you still understand
baby talk?

392
00:30:16,907 --> 00:30:18,088
I never forgot it.

393
00:30:19,473 --> 00:30:21,583
You guys go have fun.
I have work to do.

394
00:30:21,751 --> 00:30:24,441
I imagine you do.

395
00:30:44,685 --> 00:30:49,005
Hello, miss. Care to give the old
Imagination Station a go?

396
00:30:49,624 --> 00:30:52,828
Inside of every child is the ability
to be anything you want.

397
00:30:52,992 --> 00:30:55,748
Believe in yourself,
and the Imagination Station...

398
00:30:55,911 --> 00:30:57,540
...will take care of the rest.

399
00:30:57,707 --> 00:30:59,686
Maybe another time.

400
00:30:59,969 --> 00:31:01,379
But nice accent, Ringo.

401
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:04,964
- We wanna try it.
- Yeah, can we do it? Can we go?

402
00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:09,716
- We all wanna go, furry-hat man.
- This is a motley little group, isn't it?

403
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,019
Hey, he's cool.
He talks baby.

404
00:31:13,184 --> 00:31:16,738
The four of you, eh? Right.
Hop on in then.

405
00:31:16,905 --> 00:31:19,628
And let your inner dreams soar.

406
00:31:19,792 --> 00:31:22,219
Find the circles.
Stand on the circles.

407
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:24,117
In you go.

408
00:31:25,244 --> 00:31:27,934
- Let's get this party going.
- Let's go, Ringo.

409
00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:30,308
- Let's do it!
- Okay, boss.

410
00:31:32,429 --> 00:31:33,927
Where's my car seat?

411
00:31:34,097 --> 00:31:36,754
Wait a minute, we ain't strapped in.

412
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:38,931
We're gonna be launched into space!

413
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:43,004
Kahuna, are you sure this is safe?

414
00:31:45,099 --> 00:31:49,714
Archie, your hidden strength
is the power of your mind.

415
00:31:50,263 --> 00:31:52,340
You are Brain Boy.

416
00:31:54,753 --> 00:31:58,373
Quentin Finkleman, you have
more strength than you realize.

417
00:32:00,527 --> 00:32:03,468
You are Baby Courageous.

418
00:32:04,408 --> 00:32:08,673
Rosita, as tough as you are,
you have a vast depth of love.

419
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:11,229
You are Cupid Girl.

420
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:16,306
Alex, you are brimming
with energy and joy.

421
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:18,994
You are Bouncing Boy.

422
00:32:19,162 --> 00:32:22,716
Yo, Kahuna, this thing's busted.

423
00:32:22,883 --> 00:32:24,797
What are you talking about?

424
00:32:24,968 --> 00:32:26,795
What do you mean, it's busted?

425
00:32:26,956 --> 00:32:29,296
I'm not smart enough
to be Brain Boy.

426
00:32:29,459 --> 00:32:32,947
And Finkleman sure isn't tough
enough to be Baby Courageous.

427
00:32:33,115 --> 00:32:35,259
And hello, me, Cupid Girl?

428
00:32:35,424 --> 00:32:37,371
That's okay.
I like bouncing.

429
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:42,955
The only thing I love better than being
left alone is a good right hook.

430
00:32:44,181 --> 00:32:48,118
Maybe it is busted then. Or maybe
the machine's just seeing the real you.

431
00:32:48,735 --> 00:32:50,047
Think about it.

432
00:32:50,211 --> 00:32:53,699
- All right, I'll change it back. Hang on.
- Okay.

433
00:32:56,723 --> 00:32:59,927
Strawberries and cream, madam?

434
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:03,131
- Coffee and pie?
- Oh, my God.

435
00:33:09,145 --> 00:33:13,662
This place definitely rates a 10
on the weirdness scale.

436
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,446
Milk shake? Banana split?
Anything to suit your fancy, ma'am.

437
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:26,562
- Beat it!
- I say, tea and biscuits, madam?

438
00:33:26,562 --> 00:33:29,383
- Beat it!
- I say, tea and biscuits, madam?

439
00:33:30,635 --> 00:33:32,297
Shut up.
Don't open your mouth.

440
00:33:32,463 --> 00:33:36,116
I don't wanna hear one word
out of that plastic face.

441
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:43,234
I was wrong. This makes 1000
on the weirdness scale.

442
00:33:45,294 --> 00:33:48,848
- It does seem like that sometimes.
- Great, another ghost boy.

443
00:33:49,014 --> 00:33:51,354
I told you guys to beat it.

444
00:33:53,921 --> 00:33:56,995
- Oops, you're real.
- Yeah.

445
00:33:58,091 --> 00:33:59,655
I'm Zack.

446
00:33:59,824 --> 00:34:02,131
I'm confused.

447
00:34:02,903 --> 00:34:04,597
Maybe I can help you here.

448
00:34:05,821 --> 00:34:08,128
You mean he designed
all this himself?

449
00:34:08,292 --> 00:34:13,060
You bet. And he's got places like this
in Switzerland, China and Argentina.

450
00:34:13,231 --> 00:34:15,341
- He really is a superbaby.
- Super Kahuna.

451
00:34:15,508 --> 00:34:18,931
Have a little respect.
The man is over 7 years old.

452
00:34:21,474 --> 00:34:24,962
And this is what we like to call
the Com Center.

453
00:34:25,131 --> 00:34:27,887
It's our global
communications system.

454
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:30,992
We can talk to anyone
in the world at any time.

455
00:34:31,161 --> 00:34:33,884
Kylie, I see you've met Zack.

456
00:34:34,047 --> 00:34:37,536
- What's that?
- 5:00. Time to check in. Watch this.

457
00:34:37,704 --> 00:34:40,231
- Hey, Whoops, it's me.
- Mr. K.

458
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,406
- Oh, finally.
- Sorry to be so long getting back...

459
00:34:43,574 --> 00:34:45,138
- Is that...?
- Yeah.

460
00:34:45,306 --> 00:34:48,663
I went to the graduation. Remember
the kids we got from Thailand?

461
00:34:48,834 --> 00:34:50,179
- Yeah.
- My goodness.

462
00:34:50,341 --> 00:34:52,069
If you had seen their faces.

463
00:34:52,234 --> 00:34:55,110
They're at Yale. They asked for you.
They love you.

464
00:34:55,281 --> 00:34:57,971
So we'll talk again soon.
You'll call me this time?

465
00:34:58,136 --> 00:34:59,765
- I promise.
- Thank you.

466
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:03,355
- No problem. Hey, guys, what's up?
- Hey, guys, I got him. K.

467
00:35:03,525 --> 00:35:05,602
- K!
- What's up, buddy?

468
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,161
We wanna let you know,
we checked out that situation for you.

469
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:13,715
Yes, everything you said was right.
But the kids are 110 percent safe.

470
00:35:13,884 --> 00:35:17,023
- Great, guys.
- Scratches on the tricycle are minor.

471
00:35:17,188 --> 00:35:18,336
We'll fix those.

472
00:35:18,503 --> 00:35:21,927
Tell him about the superhero theme
song we've been writing for you.

473
00:35:22,096 --> 00:35:24,468
- Yeah!
- It's really good!

474
00:35:27,132 --> 00:35:28,991
Cool.

475
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,503
- That was great.
- Mr. K, that's all we have right now.

476
00:35:35,663 --> 00:35:38,320
Next time you call it'll be done,
I promise you.

477
00:35:38,487 --> 00:35:41,943
- But for now, you're the greatest...
- We have the president on line.

478
00:35:42,111 --> 00:35:43,291
- Later, K.
- Bye!

479
00:35:43,459 --> 00:35:46,761
- Oh, my gosh!
- Can you hold for a moment?

480
00:35:46,922 --> 00:35:48,486
- What is it?
- The time.

481
00:35:48,654 --> 00:35:51,148
- My Uncle Stan's gonna freak out.
- Don't worry.

482
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,258
I'm sure he's handling it just fine.

483
00:35:54,428 --> 00:35:54,492
- I'm freaking out.
- Honey, I'm sure they'll be okay.

484
00:35:54,492 --> 00:35:57,182
- I'm freaking out.
- Honey, I'm sure they'll be okay.

485
00:35:56,946 --> 00:36:00,085
What is Kylie thinking
taking the children out for so long?

486
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,459
Kylie's very responsible.

487
00:36:07,531 --> 00:36:09,324
Honey, hold this.

488
00:36:10,161 --> 00:36:11,342
Yes?

489
00:36:11,509 --> 00:36:14,418
- Are you Stan Bobbins?
- Yes.

490
00:36:14,588 --> 00:36:17,278
I'm Capt. Baker
of the San Diego Police Department.

491
00:36:17,443 --> 00:36:21,993
We have your niece, your son,
and three other babies here.

492
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,879
Oh, my gosh.
Are they okay?

493
00:36:25,045 --> 00:36:26,805
They're fine. Everything's great.

494
00:36:29,856 --> 00:36:33,345
- Well, what happened?
- Well, apparently they walked too far.

495
00:36:33,512 --> 00:36:37,350
Your niece attempted to get a bus,
but it was a one-way Greyhound...

496
00:36:37,521 --> 00:36:40,945
...and it couldn't stop
until they got to San Diego.

497
00:36:42,109 --> 00:36:45,466
- Hi, Uncle Stan, Aunt Jean.
- Hi, sweetie.

498
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:47,014
I'll pick them up.

499
00:36:47,882 --> 00:36:50,343
Negative, sir.
You'll never make it in time.

500
00:36:50,512 --> 00:36:53,454
There's a two-tanker pileup
on the 405 Freeway.

501
00:36:53,623 --> 00:36:55,668
We'll put them up
in a hotel tonight.

502
00:36:55,837 --> 00:36:57,696
Under police protection, of course.

503
00:36:57,858 --> 00:37:00,285
And we'll get nannies
to look after the kids.

504
00:37:00,776 --> 00:37:04,133
- Well, I don't know.
- No, no, no.

505
00:37:04,304 --> 00:37:05,868
We'll watch them like a hawk.

506
00:37:06,036 --> 00:37:07,829
I'll drive up in the morning.

507
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:10,901
It'll be great. It'll be fun,
like a slumber party.

508
00:37:11,682 --> 00:37:13,508
What do you think?

509
00:37:16,172 --> 00:37:18,249
At least we know they're safe.

510
00:37:18,418 --> 00:37:20,594
With traffic shut down,
we won't get there...

511
00:37:20,758 --> 00:37:23,252
...till the middle of the night.
- See you tomorrow.

512
00:37:23,421 --> 00:37:25,915
Good luck on the big premiere,
Uncle Stan.

513
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:29,440
Thanks, Kylie. Hey, and Kylie...

514
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:32,038
...I'm glad you're okay.

515
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:34,101
Bye, Archie. Bye, kids.

516
00:37:34,263 --> 00:37:35,509
- Big kisses.
- Bye, bye.

517
00:37:35,674 --> 00:37:36,887
Good night.

518
00:37:38,561 --> 00:37:39,741
Hi, Mommy. Hi, Daddy.

519
00:37:40,036 --> 00:37:41,348
Night-night.

520
00:37:41,512 --> 00:37:43,556
Okay, we bought some time.
Now what?

521
00:37:43,725 --> 00:37:47,028
I have to find out what Biscane
is up to with Bobbins' World.

522
00:37:47,189 --> 00:37:49,584
And stop him before it's too late.

523
00:37:49,979 --> 00:37:53,664
I spent 30 million dollars
and 10 years of my life.

524
00:37:53,828 --> 00:37:57,546
So why is my most elaborate
and important operation...

525
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:59,536
...in danger of being brought down?

526
00:37:59,698 --> 00:38:02,159
Because your men couldn't catch
a teenage girl?

527
00:38:02,328 --> 00:38:04,220
- Yes.
- No!

528
00:38:04,381 --> 00:38:07,235
- No.
- I know who is lurking behind this.

529
00:38:07,396 --> 00:38:08,993
- Who?
- Kahuna.

530
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,402
That makes sense.

531
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,769
I hate this bit.

532
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,312
It's unbelievable.

533
00:38:26,481 --> 00:38:29,969
Here I am on the threshold
of my ultimate dream...

534
00:38:30,138 --> 00:38:32,445
...and as always,
Kahuna seeks to destroy it.

535
00:38:32,607 --> 00:38:33,985
What shall we do?

536
00:38:39,696 --> 00:38:42,123
Hey, Archie. Up here.

537
00:38:42,326 --> 00:38:46,591
- Whoa, what are you doing up there?
- Relaxation, Arch.

538
00:38:46,752 --> 00:38:50,372
It's all about synchronizing the mind
and the body.

539
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:54,441
Kahuna, where did you get
your powers?

540
00:38:56,215 --> 00:38:59,638
Sorry, kid, it's just a story
I don't like to tell.

541
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:04,233
Listen, I like you, Archie.
You got guts.

542
00:39:04,393 --> 00:39:07,117
In fact, you remind me of me
when I was a baby.

543
00:39:07,633 --> 00:39:10,159
- Really?
- Really.

544
00:39:10,392 --> 00:39:14,362
Well, I'm gonna prove myself to you.
I'm gonna join your team.

545
00:39:14,529 --> 00:39:16,706
And we can be real superheroes.

546
00:39:16,871 --> 00:39:20,589
Before you take that path,
look at what you'd be leaving behind.

547
00:39:20,752 --> 00:39:23,825
- What, diaper rash?
- The love of your parents.

548
00:39:23,991 --> 00:39:26,452
I didn't have a choice, Arch.
You do.

549
00:39:29,508 --> 00:39:33,161
Come on, now. Time for you and your
baby buddies to get some shuteye.

550
00:39:33,325 --> 00:39:35,720
Good night, Kahuna.

551
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:39,738
- Good night, Archie.
- Sweet dreams.

552
00:39:40,702 --> 00:39:44,836
- We shall go forward as planned.
- As planned.

553
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,045
But, sir...

554
00:39:47,214 --> 00:39:50,188
...what about Kahuna and the disk?

555
00:39:50,357 --> 00:39:53,266
What about Kahuna and the disk?

556
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,772
We get it back.

557
00:39:55,938 --> 00:39:57,982
I have in my mind...

558
00:39:58,152 --> 00:40:01,225
...developing a little surprise
for Mr. Kahuna.

559
00:40:01,391 --> 00:40:03,950
How do we find him?
We don't know his location.

560
00:40:04,117 --> 00:40:05,910
We don't need to.

561
00:40:06,074 --> 00:40:10,874
- I make it so that he finds me.
- Bravo!

562
00:40:11,912 --> 00:40:13,989
So do you know baby language too?

563
00:40:14,157 --> 00:40:17,099
I can't speak it well,
but I can understand a little bit.

564
00:40:17,268 --> 00:40:19,477
How did you meet Kahuna?

565
00:40:19,641 --> 00:40:22,747
He found me in a Russian orphanage.
I was alone and scared.

566
00:40:22,913 --> 00:40:25,472
My father died, and no one knew
where my mom was.

567
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,269
Why was he there?

568
00:40:27,435 --> 00:40:30,289
He was helping match up parents
with their lost kids.

569
00:40:30,451 --> 00:40:32,912
He tried but could never find
my mom.

570
00:40:33,209 --> 00:40:34,871
That's when he took me in.

571
00:40:35,037 --> 00:40:37,214
Hey, Zack.

572
00:40:37,379 --> 00:40:40,321
How does Kahuna...?
You know.

573
00:40:39,891 --> 00:40:43,642
Help save the world, disarm bad guys,
drive turbo-powered baby buggies?

574
00:40:43,803 --> 00:40:46,942
- Yeah.
- It's quite a story.

575
00:40:47,107 --> 00:40:50,311
Parts I learned from Kahuna.
Some I found out on my own.

576
00:40:50,475 --> 00:40:53,549
Where the facts end
and the legend begins...

577
00:40:53,972 --> 00:40:56,148
...no one really knows for sure.

578
00:40:56,569 --> 00:40:58,778
You see, Kahuna's father
was a scientist.

579
00:40:58,943 --> 00:41:02,563
One of the best. He lived and worked
in a secret American Army base...

580
00:41:02,728 --> 00:41:04,970
...in Germany
after the First World War.

581
00:41:05,133 --> 00:41:09,103
After he saw the horrible conditions
the soldiers suffered during the war...

582
00:41:09,272 --> 00:41:13,405
...he dedicated his time to developing
a kind of super vitamin formula.

583
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,844
A formula to unlock the area
in the brain...

584
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:18,347
...that gives children
their amazing energy.

585
00:41:18,797 --> 00:41:22,417
The soldiers who lived in harsh
environments, with low food rations...

586
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:24,824
...would have a better chance
of survival.

587
00:41:24,988 --> 00:41:27,711
But he created something
even more powerful.

588
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:29,854
A sort of fountain of youth formula...

589
00:41:30,024 --> 00:41:32,364
...which actually stopped
the aging process.

590
00:41:32,525 --> 00:41:34,439
Because Kahuna's father
was widowed...

591
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:38,231
...he took his sons everywhere.
The babies competed for attention.

592
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:41,468
Shut up.
Stop crying, you little brat.

593
00:41:41,634 --> 00:41:43,045
Kenny...

594
00:41:43,206 --> 00:41:45,481
...would you be nice
to your little brother?

595
00:41:45,644 --> 00:41:48,236
I've told you this before.

596
00:42:01,682 --> 00:42:04,504
Kahuna's father worried
that the enemy would realize...

597
00:42:04,729 --> 00:42:07,900
...the potential of his formula
and use it for evil purposes.

598
00:42:07,529 --> 00:42:09,223
And he was right.

599
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:37,869
Ten years later,
Kahuna was stronger...

600
00:42:38,032 --> 00:42:40,339
...smarter and faster
than anyone else.

601
00:42:40,727 --> 00:42:43,548
But he was stuck in the same
little body.

602
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:45,948
He was like the Peter Pan of babies.

603
00:43:01,608 --> 00:43:06,190
Hey, man, your brother gives
everybody the creeps. He's a freak.

604
00:43:18,511 --> 00:43:21,585
Your brother is a regular
teenage boy. Just like you.

605
00:43:21,751 --> 00:43:25,075
- You always stick up for him.
- His life is hard.

606
00:43:25,312 --> 00:43:28,668
What happened wasn't
your brother's fault, it was mine.

607
00:43:30,219 --> 00:43:33,095
You think he's so smart.
Well, face it.

608
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:36,695
He's a freak! I can't even relate
to this family.

609
00:43:36,859 --> 00:43:39,068
I feel more German
than I am American.

610
00:43:39,456 --> 00:43:43,656
I should be with people
who appreciate a normal kid!

611
00:43:49,143 --> 00:43:53,758
His father worked so hard to develop
an antidote for Kahuna's condition.

612
00:43:54,595 --> 00:43:58,051
But unfortunately,
he couldn't complete his work.

613
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,163
Take what you were given,
and make something good out of it.

614
00:44:18,332 --> 00:44:19,961
All right?

615
00:44:22,533 --> 00:44:25,574
You may forever have the body
of a child, you know.

616
00:44:25,933 --> 00:44:29,007
But you'll always have the heart
of a hero.

617
00:44:44,184 --> 00:44:46,523
I love you, Daddy.

618
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:10,255
Although he was now 18 years old...

619
00:45:10,421 --> 00:45:12,400
...nobody believed it.

620
00:45:20,044 --> 00:45:23,762
After six months in the orphanage,
Kahuna realized his true destiny.

621
00:45:24,694 --> 00:45:28,565
He would find a way to help all
the orphans and children of the world.

622
00:45:28,736 --> 00:45:31,940
So in the dark of the night,
Kahuna slipped away.

623
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,280
And a legend was born.

624
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:37,839
- Wow.
- I'll say.

625
00:45:38,005 --> 00:45:40,466
What about the serum
he drinks from his bottle?

626
00:45:40,635 --> 00:45:43,905
The stuff that turns him
into a superbaby?

627
00:45:44,068 --> 00:45:47,786
It's a natural formula which interacts
with Kahuna's unique physiology.

628
00:45:47,949 --> 00:45:50,376
- Kahuna invented it himself.
- Why?

629
00:45:51,157 --> 00:45:54,547
He realized, long ago, that if
a 2 foot tall superhero...

630
00:45:54,716 --> 00:45:58,883
...were to become the defender of the
weak, he was gonna need an edge.

631
00:46:08,797 --> 00:46:13,150
Now, the whole trick here
is just focus and visualize.

632
00:46:13,385 --> 00:46:17,617
The only thing I can visualize
is me falling on my butt.

633
00:46:21,435 --> 00:46:24,377
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

634
00:46:30,352 --> 00:46:33,393
- What's this?
- Don't know. Does it have a label?

635
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:35,506
I'm not sure.

636
00:46:35,677 --> 00:46:38,498
It's got a microdot.
Where'd you get this?

637
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:42,597
Wait a second. When I bumped into
that Crowe guy, Biscane's flunky...

638
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:45,292
...maybe it fell into the stroller.
- Maybe.

639
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:48,183
It could be something.
I'm gonna show it to Kahuna.

640
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,173
Good idea.

641
00:46:51,105 --> 00:46:54,462
Oh, by the way,
what are you doing later?

642
00:46:54,697 --> 00:46:56,807
I'm going home.

643
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:01,368
Well, I just thought maybe, since
you're leaving after lunch...

644
00:47:01,529 --> 00:47:04,985
...that you and me, we could,
you know...

645
00:47:05,154 --> 00:47:07,877
...go have lunch up outside.
- Like a picnic.

646
00:47:08,041 --> 00:47:10,982
Totally. Yes, like a picnic.

647
00:47:11,729 --> 00:47:15,448
So 11:30 behind the H?

648
00:47:15,835 --> 00:47:19,586
- Yeah, definitely.
- Cool.

649
00:47:24,944 --> 00:47:27,121
I've got a date!

650
00:47:29,306 --> 00:47:32,095
Great. Got a date.

651
00:47:32,257 --> 00:47:34,116
My hair.

652
00:47:35,304 --> 00:47:38,213
At least I got a cool pair of shoes.

653
00:47:40,405 --> 00:47:44,123
I may not be much at this girlie stuff,
but I think I can help her out.

654
00:47:44,285 --> 00:47:47,489
I can help too. I'm very connected
to my feminine side.

655
00:47:47,653 --> 00:47:49,282
- Hi.
- Hey.

656
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:50,630
What?

657
00:47:50,796 --> 00:47:53,486
- What do you guys want?
- Come, Kylie.

658
00:47:53,651 --> 00:47:56,560
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm coming.

659
00:48:08,951 --> 00:48:11,160
Well, you wouldn't believe
the help I had.

660
00:48:11,773 --> 00:48:12,954
Total wow.

661
00:48:13,258 --> 00:48:16,682
- You come up here a lot?
- Yeah, I do.

662
00:48:17,076 --> 00:48:19,799
Try to imagine what's going on
in each of the homes.

663
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:23,714
Do they have kids, are they being
tucked into bed for the night?

664
00:48:24,228 --> 00:48:26,984
You miss her?
Your mom, I mean.

665
00:48:27,147 --> 00:48:30,767
Well, don't get me wrong,
living with Kahuna's been great.

666
00:48:30,932 --> 00:48:33,655
I wouldn't give it up for anything
in the world.

667
00:48:33,819 --> 00:48:37,472
But, you know, I just wonder,
you know.

668
00:48:42,511 --> 00:48:44,173
What's that?

669
00:48:44,885 --> 00:48:48,308
If you don't know what a kiss is,
I must be doing this wrong.

670
00:48:48,541 --> 00:48:51,865
- No, that.
- Oh, Kahuna.

671
00:48:52,807 --> 00:48:55,268
Zack, the disk you and Kylie found?

672
00:48:55,437 --> 00:48:57,099
- The disk?
- Yeah.

673
00:48:57,265 --> 00:49:00,339
- Get down here right away.
- The disk. Let's go.

674
00:49:06,086 --> 00:49:09,837
- See anything strange?
- Besides a frog in a top hat?

675
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,689
I was talking about this.
Looks like scrambled data.

676
00:49:12,854 --> 00:49:16,090
- What is that?
- I think it's part of the puzzle.

677
00:49:16,254 --> 00:49:19,611
Technically, this activates
a descrambler program.

678
00:49:19,783 --> 00:49:22,123
Similar to the ones used
on TV cable boxes...

679
00:49:22,284 --> 00:49:25,160
...to receive premium channels.
- He is up to something.

680
00:49:25,331 --> 00:49:28,437
Whatever he's planning,
it's going down at Bobbins' World...

681
00:49:28,603 --> 00:49:31,959
...in 30 minutes. I wanna be there.
- What about us?

682
00:49:32,324 --> 00:49:35,714
Oh, no. I'm feeling
nauseous again.

683
00:49:35,884 --> 00:49:37,164
One day, Finkleman...

684
00:49:37,327 --> 00:49:39,984
...you'll find courage
where you least expect it.

685
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:44,087
Yeah. I was kind of hoping
I'd finally get to smack somebody.

686
00:49:44,288 --> 00:49:46,180
Suit up, Zack. We're going in.

687
00:49:53,044 --> 00:49:54,608
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey, Finkie.

688
00:49:54,777 --> 00:49:57,018
- Hey, Maria. How you doing?
- You okay?

689
00:49:57,182 --> 00:49:58,429
- You all right?
- Miss me?

690
00:49:58,593 --> 00:50:00,737
- Auntie Jean.
- Hi.

691
00:50:01,448 --> 00:50:03,493
Hey, Kahuna, you forgot this.

692
00:50:03,661 --> 00:50:06,001
I didn't forget.
I want you to hold on to it.

693
00:50:06,163 --> 00:50:08,590
You'll understand why later.

694
00:50:08,761 --> 00:50:11,002
- Take care, Arch.
- Wow.

695
00:50:11,872 --> 00:50:14,879
- I missed you.
- Hey, Archie.

696
00:50:15,047 --> 00:50:16,907
- Uncle Stan.
- Yeah.

697
00:50:17,068 --> 00:50:19,047
Come on. The show's gonna start.

698
00:50:19,217 --> 00:50:21,590
Ladies and gentlemen,
the time has arrived.

699
00:50:21,751 --> 00:50:24,955
The master is here, the champion
of children everywhere.

700
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:26,945
You know him, you love him.

701
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:29,634
Mr. Bill Biscane.

702
00:50:29,802 --> 00:50:33,673
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
The spectacle is at hand.

703
00:50:33,844 --> 00:50:37,496
I'll let you all know when there is
just 60 seconds left.

704
00:50:37,661 --> 00:50:39,607
Kahuna is here.

705
00:50:39,778 --> 00:50:43,878
And I guarantee, this will change
the way you think...

706
00:50:44,044 --> 00:50:46,471
...about television, that is.

707
00:50:51,197 --> 00:50:55,363
Zack, direct your helmet camera
towards the satellite dish.

708
00:50:55,526 --> 00:50:56,707
Towards the dish.

709
00:50:58,478 --> 00:50:59,910
Hold it there, Zack.

710
00:51:00,081 --> 00:51:03,985
That box is giving enough
power to light up Times Square.

711
00:51:04,315 --> 00:51:05,692
Find anything?

712
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:08,194
- Yeah, I think so.
- Okay, cool.

713
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:10,850
Are we ready?
Let's count it down.

714
00:51:11,019 --> 00:51:12,910
Fifty-six now.

715
00:51:13,072 --> 00:51:16,112
Fifty-five. Fifty-four.

716
00:51:16,279 --> 00:51:20,762
If this man wants to conquer the world,
what better way than television?

717
00:51:23,175 --> 00:51:24,935
That's it.

718
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,210
Zack, I think I figured it out.

719
00:51:27,377 --> 00:51:29,487
There's code hidden
in his transmissions.

720
00:51:29,654 --> 00:51:33,788
I think it'll be used to broadcast
the mind-altering signal to the kids.

721
00:51:33,985 --> 00:51:36,095
If anything happens, look inside.

722
00:51:36,262 --> 00:51:38,154
- Forty-one.
- Okay, kid.

723
00:51:41,201 --> 00:51:44,175
Thirty-four. Thirty-three.

724
00:51:44,345 --> 00:51:48,248
Thirty-two. Thirty-one.

725
00:52:01,185 --> 00:52:03,908
Engage. Lift off.

726
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:07,853
Twenty-six. Twenty-five.

727
00:52:08,016 --> 00:52:10,575
Twenty-four. Twenty-three.

728
00:52:12,837 --> 00:52:15,910
Eighteen. Seventeen.

729
00:52:16,173 --> 00:52:18,349
Sixteen. Fifteen.

730
00:52:25,731 --> 00:52:29,602
Three. Two. One.

731
00:52:34,616 --> 00:52:38,170
Look! There's Muggles!

732
00:52:56,331 --> 00:53:00,114
Hello, Kahuna.
I'm so happy to see you again.

733
00:53:08,776 --> 00:53:10,788
I can't see. I can't see.

734
00:53:15,736 --> 00:53:19,487
- Where's Kahuna?
- He's vanished.

735
00:53:19,874 --> 00:53:21,820
It's all right, ladies and gentlemen.

736
00:53:22,472 --> 00:53:23,882
After the spots clear...

737
00:53:24,044 --> 00:53:27,467
...you'll realize it's just a special effect.
A hologram.

738
00:53:27,636 --> 00:53:31,125
There was no real child.
There was no helicopter.

739
00:53:31,293 --> 00:53:34,749
It was all just for your entertainment.
You having fun?

740
00:53:37,612 --> 00:53:39,438
Get out of the way, kids!

741
00:53:47,715 --> 00:53:48,928
I'm all right.

742
00:53:49,094 --> 00:53:50,986
Vandals! Security!

743
00:53:51,147 --> 00:53:54,023
Vandals! Security!

744
00:53:54,194 --> 00:53:56,370
Just in time. Arrest that man.

745
00:53:56,536 --> 00:53:58,066
Whoa, hey.
What are you doing?

746
00:53:58,236 --> 00:54:02,469
Arresting you, officer. We'll start with
destruction of private property.

747
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:04,040
- We can explain.
- I hope so.

748
00:54:04,202 --> 00:54:05,897
- What's going on?
- It's Biscane.

749
00:54:06,062 --> 00:54:08,434
There's some mind-control thing
on the show.

750
00:54:08,596 --> 00:54:12,883
Next thing you know, she'll be saying
that babies have a secret language.

751
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,546
But they do speak
a secret language.

752
00:54:16,454 --> 00:54:17,405
Get my coat.

753
00:54:17,705 --> 00:54:21,292
The babies stumbled on to something.
So Kane destroyed Kahuna.

754
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:25,778
We will clean all this up and resume
the premiere at 6:00 sharp.

755
00:54:25,948 --> 00:54:29,984
In the meantime,
enjoy the refreshments.

756
00:54:31,177 --> 00:54:33,638
- Wanna press charges?
- No need to press charges.

757
00:54:33,807 --> 00:54:37,295
You see, I am a generous
and loving person.

758
00:54:37,463 --> 00:54:43,140
You're a real bad, bad, bad, bad man.

759
00:54:44,167 --> 00:54:48,433
I may not understand your language,
but I know what you're thinking.

760
00:54:48,593 --> 00:54:52,377
Stay out of my way runt,
or else.

761
00:54:57,799 --> 00:55:01,287
Will someone retrieve
this unfortunate child?

762
00:55:03,123 --> 00:55:04,883
Coat.

763
00:55:09,988 --> 00:55:12,864
He wouldn't just leave us.
He's out there somewhere.

764
00:55:13,035 --> 00:55:14,982
He'll come back
when we need him.

765
00:55:15,152 --> 00:55:17,459
What are we going to do without him?

766
00:55:17,621 --> 00:55:19,633
Don't worry. He'll be back.

767
00:55:19,803 --> 00:55:22,012
I'll worry if I wanna worry.

768
00:55:22,176 --> 00:55:26,179
There's never gonna be anyone
like him. So brave, so powerful.

769
00:55:26,378 --> 00:55:27,657
- So tough.
- Oh, man.

770
00:55:27,822 --> 00:55:30,446
He was indeed one in a million.

771
00:55:30,612 --> 00:55:34,068
- To the 14th power.
- I miss Kahuna.

772
00:55:34,236 --> 00:55:36,893
And who's gonna save the children
from Biscane now?

773
00:55:37,059 --> 00:55:40,000
- Yeah.
- Well, it's your world now, Archie.

774
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,211
You know what?
I'm just a baby.

775
00:55:43,377 --> 00:55:47,730
A whiny, drooling diaper jockey.

776
00:55:48,092 --> 00:55:51,548
I don't have the brains to come up
with some super plan...

777
00:55:51,878 --> 00:55:53,125
...like Kahuna.

778
00:55:53,289 --> 00:55:56,745
I can kick some diaper,
but I'm no Kahuna.

779
00:55:59,063 --> 00:56:00,855
Kahuna.

780
00:56:06,702 --> 00:56:10,355
Hey, kids, if you're watching
this right now, things can't be good.

781
00:56:10,519 --> 00:56:12,564
It means something has happened
to me...

782
00:56:12,732 --> 00:56:16,866
...and the children of the world
are quite possibly in grave danger.

783
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:20,354
I can't tell you what to do next,
but I can say this:

784
00:56:20,526 --> 00:56:24,332
Archie, you believed there was
a Kahuna when nobody else would.

785
00:56:24,504 --> 00:56:28,408
Now I'm asking all of you
to take a leap of faith...

786
00:56:28,577 --> 00:56:32,613
...and believe in something even
more powerful than a superbaby.

787
00:56:32,779 --> 00:56:36,300
- What's more powerful than that?
- Yourselves.

788
00:56:36,467 --> 00:56:41,082
Every child has power.
All you have to do is believe.

789
00:56:41,311 --> 00:56:44,931
All right, guys, I guess
that's all there is to say.

790
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:47,782
Whatever you decide...

791
00:56:47,951 --> 00:56:49,744
...good luck.

792
00:56:50,485 --> 00:56:53,558
Playtime is over.
Kahuna's right.

793
00:56:53,724 --> 00:56:55,868
We've gotta start believing
in ourselves.

794
00:56:56,033 --> 00:56:58,045
We're not just babies anymore.

795
00:56:58,311 --> 00:57:00,203
We can be heroes.

796
00:57:00,364 --> 00:57:02,638
- I'm down.
- Come on, Rosita.

797
00:57:02,801 --> 00:57:05,590
You have more power than 10 boys
put together.

798
00:57:05,752 --> 00:57:08,475
You got that right. I'm in.

799
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:12,160
Finkleman, we can't do it without you.

800
00:57:12,327 --> 00:57:14,788
Put your hand on the rattle
or deal with Rosita.

801
00:57:15,022 --> 00:57:16,881
We've gotta work together
as a team.

802
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:18,640
What do you say?

803
00:57:18,806 --> 00:57:22,940
K for Kahuna!

804
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:29,768
Kahuna, Kahuna, Kahuna.

805
00:57:47,482 --> 00:57:50,423
So how does it feel to be in chains?

806
00:57:50,593 --> 00:57:52,540
I designed them myself, by the way.

807
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:54,470
From a titanium alloy.

808
00:57:54,635 --> 00:57:57,358
You've got way too much time
on your hands, Kane.

809
00:57:57,521 --> 00:58:00,824
I bet you don't know how
we did our disappearing act.

810
00:58:00,986 --> 00:58:02,583
You altered the decoder box...

811
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:05,604
...to reflect my laser beam
right back at me.

812
00:58:06,246 --> 00:58:09,253
You snatched me while everybody
was seeing stars.

813
00:58:09,421 --> 00:58:11,598
And you played right into it.

814
00:58:11,859 --> 00:58:14,648
Anyway, I foiled your plot
to brainwash those babies.

815
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:18,080
You think that was my plot?
That's always been your problem.

816
00:58:18,242 --> 00:58:21,348
You are small, so you think small.

817
00:58:21,674 --> 00:58:24,528
Why should I waste my time
with bedwetting babies...

818
00:58:24,689 --> 00:58:27,925
...when I can control the minds
of the entire world?

819
00:58:28,089 --> 00:58:29,948
In just a few hours...

820
00:58:30,109 --> 00:58:33,696
...all worldwide TV networks...

821
00:58:33,862 --> 00:58:37,383
...will be switching from their satellites
to my state-of-the-art...

822
00:58:37,552 --> 00:58:40,460
...Telespace 3000.
- So it's a mind-control pulse.

823
00:58:40,631 --> 00:58:44,283
Millions of couch potatoes
will fill their minds...

824
00:58:44,447 --> 00:58:48,165
...with nothing but the needs
of Bill Biscane.

825
00:58:48,329 --> 00:58:51,653
Buying Biscane products, watching
the Biscane satellite network.

826
00:58:51,825 --> 00:58:54,646
Investing their life savings
in Biscane stocks.

827
00:58:54,808 --> 00:58:56,951
All Biscane, all the time.

828
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:58,681
So it's true what they say.

829
00:58:58,849 --> 00:59:01,189
There is nothing but junk
on television.

830
00:59:01,479 --> 00:59:05,350
You're just jealous because
I'm winning this time. Me, me, me.

831
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,823
- He's always pulling me down!
- I know. He's a bully, sir.

832
00:59:09,402 --> 00:59:11,316
This isn't over.

833
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:14,556
It will be at 6:00.

834
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:18,213
Enjoy your stay
at my little child-care center.

835
00:59:18,382 --> 00:59:21,236
I created it especially for you.
Take him away.

836
00:59:27,492 --> 00:59:28,771
Is he gone?

837
00:59:51,003 --> 00:59:53,245
Who's your decorator, Spider-Man?

838
00:59:53,601 --> 00:59:55,361
Search him.

839
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:23,515
What can I tell you?
Little boys like their toys.

840
01:00:35,395 --> 01:00:37,734
I'll take a 10 a.m. wake-up call.

841
01:00:50,791 --> 01:00:53,415
Good night, sweet prince.

842
01:01:01,183 --> 01:01:03,556
Is that your secret with children, Dan?

843
01:01:03,717 --> 01:01:07,370
Did you actually communicate
with the babies just like you said?

844
01:01:07,535 --> 01:01:09,995
The babies are missing again.

845
01:01:11,159 --> 01:01:14,712
- What is going on around here?
- I don't know.

846
01:01:17,767 --> 01:01:20,293
- Did you see that?
- See what?

847
01:01:21,294 --> 01:01:23,471
You're not gonna believe this.

848
01:01:27,004 --> 01:01:31,772
- Hey, Archie, I got the keys.
- Nice work, Alex.

849
01:01:31,944 --> 01:01:34,951
Okay, team, here we go.

850
01:01:35,985 --> 01:01:37,395
- Archie!
- What on earth...

851
01:01:37,557 --> 01:01:39,700
...do you kids think you're doing?

852
01:01:39,866 --> 01:01:42,742
I have the Finklemans and Haley's
mom ready to sue me...

853
01:01:42,913 --> 01:01:46,182
...over your first disappearing act.
Now it's Grand Theft Auto?

854
01:01:46,345 --> 01:01:47,909
It's not that simple.

855
01:01:48,879 --> 01:01:50,956
Before you say anything, just listen.

856
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:53,913
I tried to tell you before,
but you didn't believe me.

857
01:01:54,075 --> 01:01:57,629
Bill Biscane is not the man
you think he is.

858
01:01:57,796 --> 01:02:02,214
He does have a mind-control pulse
that he tried to use on the babies.

859
01:02:02,671 --> 01:02:05,777
Sometimes you need to trust
your heart instead of your head.

860
01:02:05,943 --> 01:02:07,987
- Kylie's cool.
- I really need your help.

861
01:02:08,156 --> 01:02:10,715
The babies need your help.
Kahuna needs your help.

862
01:02:10,883 --> 01:02:14,186
- We can't do it without you.
- What's a Kahuna?

863
01:02:14,347 --> 01:02:17,671
Hey, Garbot, over here.
Over here. Over here.

864
01:02:23,242 --> 01:02:24,522
Activate laser scan.

865
01:02:25,296 --> 01:02:27,210
I am active.

866
01:02:59,296 --> 01:02:59,359
Lots of people talked
about world domination.

867
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:02,333
Lots of people talked
about world domination.

868
01:03:02,503 --> 01:03:04,580
Caesar. Napoleon.

869
01:03:04,748 --> 01:03:06,246
Darth Vader.

870
01:03:06,416 --> 01:03:10,200
Darth Vader. But nobody's
really pulled it off.

871
01:03:10,939 --> 01:03:12,436
Until now.

872
01:03:12,607 --> 01:03:15,614
You truly are a great visionary.

873
01:03:16,007 --> 01:03:18,948
Sir, we're ready to initiate
the universal uplink switch.

874
01:03:19,117 --> 01:03:20,681
I'll take that off your hands.

875
01:03:24,955 --> 01:03:26,748
Don't bother.
I'll show myself out.

876
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:29,476
Hasta la vista, baby.

877
01:03:30,184 --> 01:03:32,458
Get him!
Get him!

878
01:03:41,955 --> 01:03:43,234
- Where?
- There.

879
01:03:45,772 --> 01:03:49,326
All right, wise guy, how you
gonna get off this roof now?

880
01:04:29,554 --> 01:04:31,052
Keep your eye on the radar.

881
01:04:39,819 --> 01:04:43,373
How many people are in this car?
We couldn't get another vehicle?

882
01:04:58,198 --> 01:05:01,304
Zack? Zack?

883
01:05:03,842 --> 01:05:07,495
- Holy...
- My thoughts exactly.

884
01:05:08,044 --> 01:05:09,674
Zack.

885
01:05:09,873 --> 01:05:13,394
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- The question is, what are you doing?

886
01:05:13,561 --> 01:05:15,638
- What's wrong?
- The satellite receiver...

887
01:05:15,807 --> 01:05:18,496
...is detecting a vehicle
moving this way.

888
01:05:18,662 --> 01:05:21,735
That's me, Zack. I'm coming in.
We got visitors.

889
01:05:21,901 --> 01:05:25,357
This Kahuna guy must be super.
Would you look at this place?

890
01:05:25,525 --> 01:05:27,702
You guys spent the night here?

891
01:05:27,867 --> 01:05:29,694
Mr. And Mrs. Bobbins?

892
01:05:29,856 --> 01:05:33,607
Hi. You guys might wanna get ready.
We're about to have company.

893
01:05:33,768 --> 01:05:36,141
Followed by a small army
of Biscane's men...

894
01:05:36,302 --> 01:05:38,829
I think I've got a way
to even the odds.

895
01:05:38,997 --> 01:05:40,757
Come on, guys. Come with me.

896
01:05:40,921 --> 01:05:43,448
Let's get into the Imagination Station.

897
01:05:43,616 --> 01:05:46,043
We can become our superselves
and help Kahuna.

898
01:05:46,214 --> 01:05:48,839
- Hello? We're outnumbered.
- And we're outsized.

899
01:05:49,005 --> 01:05:50,634
Remember, you have to believe.

900
01:05:50,801 --> 01:05:53,880
Believe you can do anything you set
your minds and hearts out to do.

901
01:05:54,615 --> 01:05:56,058
Oh, no. I'm getting nauseous again.

902
01:06:21,161 --> 01:06:23,173
Right this way.

903
01:06:27,352 --> 01:06:29,911
Right this way.
Is anyone listening to me?

904
01:06:30,398 --> 01:06:31,928
He's here.

905
01:06:32,547 --> 01:06:35,424
He's right here.
Right in this doorway.

906
01:06:37,423 --> 01:06:41,776
He's here. He's here. We found it.
Prepare all units for a beach landing.

907
01:06:41,945 --> 01:06:44,318
- Prepare units for a landing.
- Single file.

908
01:06:44,479 --> 01:06:45,791
Single file.

909
01:06:46,051 --> 01:06:48,358
So, Kahuna...

910
01:06:49,996 --> 01:06:53,167
This is déjà vu all over again.

911
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:59,164
- I can't let you win.
- You have no choice. You see?

912
01:06:59,330 --> 01:07:03,464
I have my crack troops with me.
Look. And reinforcements.

913
01:07:03,628 --> 01:07:08,079
You haven't got a snowball's chance.
This is it for you. It's over.

914
01:07:08,472 --> 01:07:10,134
Nice spot.

915
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:14,784
A little candy cane for my taste,
but then, I am an adult.

916
01:07:15,913 --> 01:07:19,237
l... I am even a little sad
that this must end.

917
01:07:19,409 --> 01:07:22,515
You have been a formidable opponent.

918
01:07:22,873 --> 01:07:25,082
Congratulations.

919
01:07:25,824 --> 01:07:29,094
But this time, I am too many
and too powerful.

920
01:07:29,256 --> 01:07:30,918
And as always...

921
01:07:31,084 --> 01:07:32,517
...you are all alone.

922
01:07:32,688 --> 01:07:35,957
- Kahuna is not alone.
- Kahuna is not alone.

923
01:07:36,121 --> 01:07:38,100
- One of your little tricks?
- Not alone.

924
01:07:38,269 --> 01:07:39,833
- Not alone.
- Not alone.

925
01:07:40,001 --> 01:07:41,828
- Not alone.
- Who is this...

926
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:44,549
...that stands with Kahuna
against Bill Biscane?

927
01:07:48,918 --> 01:07:52,122
- It's me.
- And me.

928
01:07:53,408 --> 01:07:56,930
And me.
A History of the Diaper Wars.

929
01:07:58,092 --> 01:07:59,305
Hey.

930
01:07:59,791 --> 01:08:01,038
Me too.

931
01:08:02,774 --> 01:08:04,688
- And me.
- And me.

932
01:08:05,598 --> 01:08:06,615
And us.

933
01:08:07,938 --> 01:08:09,469
All right, team!

934
01:08:10,762 --> 01:08:13,835
Well, as Genghis Khan once said:

935
01:08:14,001 --> 01:08:16,658
"The more the merrier."
I want the disk!

936
01:08:16,824 --> 01:08:19,196
You want it? Come and get it.

937
01:08:20,384 --> 01:08:22,845
- I got it!
- Charge! Take no prisoners!

938
01:08:23,014 --> 01:08:24,261
Now I'm excited.

939
01:08:24,425 --> 01:08:27,017
All right, superbabies,
let's see what you can do.

940
01:08:31,257 --> 01:08:32,985
It's my turn!

941
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:37,763
Why not freshen up a little?

942
01:08:39,212 --> 01:08:41,639
All right, Fink!
Major power move!

943
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:45,463
Come on, get them!
You are big soldiers. Do something!

944
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:48,827
There it is. Get the disk!

945
01:08:48,995 --> 01:08:50,657
- Open your eyes.
- It's mine!

946
01:08:52,715 --> 01:08:53,666
It's mine!

947
01:08:57,912 --> 01:09:00,088
There it is! That's it! Get it, get it!

948
01:09:00,253 --> 01:09:02,429
Boost me up! Boost me up!

949
01:09:03,653 --> 01:09:06,824
You know, the old me would have
knocked you boys senseless...

950
01:09:06,989 --> 01:09:10,609
...with a right hook. But Cupid Girl
would rather spread the love.

951
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:14,291
Got you.

952
01:09:14,463 --> 01:09:17,819
You can run, but you can't
hide from Cupid Girl.

953
01:09:19,434 --> 01:09:20,779
I love you, man.

954
01:09:20,942 --> 01:09:23,730
- Give me a hug, you big lug.
- Oh, no.

955
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:27,162
This is the worst news yet. Come on.

956
01:09:27,325 --> 01:09:30,179
- Okay, Rosita!
- Come on, they are babies!

957
01:09:30,339 --> 01:09:31,454
Get them, get them!

958
01:09:31,623 --> 01:09:33,897
Come on, they're babies.
Get them, get them!

959
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:36,105
You don't have
to say everything I say.

960
01:09:36,273 --> 01:09:38,898
You don't have
to say everything I say.

961
01:09:40,218 --> 01:09:41,596
Yes!

962
01:09:42,689 --> 01:09:46,243
- I got it!
- I got it! I got it!

963
01:09:52,568 --> 01:09:54,460
Nobody messes with my son.

964
01:09:56,063 --> 01:09:57,856
- That's it! This is the idea!
- Hey!

965
01:09:58,021 --> 01:09:59,518
- That's my husband.
- So?

966
01:10:04,468 --> 01:10:07,509
- Right in the forbidden zone.
- Oh, honey.

967
01:10:07,675 --> 01:10:10,912
- Honey, are you okay?
- That hurt a lot.

968
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:17,867
- That disk belongs to me, girlie.
- Who you calling girlie, sister?

969
01:10:24,066 --> 01:10:27,335
- Alex!
- What's happening?

970
01:10:27,498 --> 01:10:32,878
Get that one. And that one.
And that one. And that one.

971
01:10:33,046 --> 01:10:34,839
- Do it!
- You bet.

972
01:10:52,067 --> 01:10:55,458
- Can a brother get some water?
- Alex, you're sweating.

973
01:10:55,691 --> 01:10:57,321
Here.

974
01:10:58,578 --> 01:11:02,778
Must find the communication center.
We're losing time, precious time.

975
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:05,150
That looks like
the communication center.

976
01:11:05,314 --> 01:11:07,206
Thanks, Kahuna.

977
01:11:10,446 --> 01:11:11,944
Get back to work.

978
01:11:21,448 --> 01:11:24,302
That should keep them
sleeping for a while.

979
01:11:28,793 --> 01:11:29,843
Got you.

980
01:11:30,172 --> 01:11:33,825
All right, Brain Boy.
You figured it out, huh, Brain Boy?

981
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:36,679
- Yeah.
- Give me five, Arch.

982
01:11:38,144 --> 01:11:40,320
You stay here. No one must pass.

983
01:11:40,486 --> 01:11:41,535
- Right.
- No one.

984
01:11:41,801 --> 01:11:43,878
Alex, you were great.

985
01:11:44,206 --> 01:11:46,699
All right, honey.
Archie, come over here!

986
01:11:48,664 --> 01:11:49,402
We did it!

987
01:11:49,402 --> 01:11:49,905
We did it!

988
01:11:50,075 --> 01:11:51,256
Tascha. Tascha.

989
01:11:51,423 --> 01:11:53,370
Wake up. Wake up.

990
01:11:54,598 --> 01:11:56,938
It's me. Up here.
Billy. Bill Biscane.

991
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:59,594
The disk. Throw it up here.

992
01:11:59,794 --> 01:12:02,101
Come to papa. Come.

993
01:12:13,266 --> 01:12:14,381
The disk!

994
01:12:24,332 --> 01:12:26,409
I did it! I did it! I did it!

995
01:12:27,315 --> 01:12:29,808
It's too late. It's too late.

996
01:12:30,458 --> 01:12:32,952
Thanks to the power
of your own uplink...

997
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,197
...I can bounce
the mind-control pulse...

998
01:12:35,366 --> 01:12:38,504
...off the satellite right from here.
It's so convenient.

999
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:41,131
If I didn't hate you so much,
I would thank you.

1000
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:43,344
What happened back then
wasn't my fault.

1001
01:12:41,913 --> 01:12:46,746
- You don't have to keep hating me.
- Don't flatter yourself.

1002
01:12:46,781 --> 01:12:48,515
You think I went to all this trouble
because Dad liked you best?

1003
01:12:50,381 --> 01:12:52,525
- "Dad"?
- What are you talking about?

1004
01:12:52,690 --> 01:12:57,010
Gee whiz, your little band of merry
diaper men haven't figured it out yet?

1005
01:12:57,180 --> 01:13:00,221
Biscane here is Ken, my brother.

1006
01:13:26,144 --> 01:13:30,792
I should have been the one
to get the superhero powers.

1007
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:36,401
I should have stayed young forever.
You took all that from me.

1008
01:13:36,569 --> 01:13:38,844
- It's over.
- You're wrong.

1009
01:13:39,006 --> 01:13:41,083
There's no fail-safe.

1010
01:13:41,444 --> 01:13:45,228
And this program will transmit
a mind-control pulse no matter what.

1011
01:13:45,389 --> 01:13:49,840
The satellite can't be shut down,
blown up or knocked off course.

1012
01:13:50,008 --> 01:13:53,365
Ken, one. Kahuna, zip.

1013
01:13:53,537 --> 01:13:57,802
How does it feel, after all these years,
to be the one that is defeated?

1014
01:13:57,963 --> 01:14:01,101
- How does it feel? Tell me.
- It feels bad.

1015
01:14:01,267 --> 01:14:04,241
Yeah, it feels bad. Feels really lousy,
doesn't it? Good.

1016
01:14:05,010 --> 01:14:07,602
There. Now, was that so hard?

1017
01:14:07,768 --> 01:14:09,372
There's still one trick
you haven't learned yet.

1018
01:14:09,634 --> 01:14:10,489
Really?

1019
01:14:10,524 --> 01:14:12,438
I'm about to become the most
powerful man in the world.

1020
01:14:12,601 --> 01:14:15,258
Enlighten me.
What is it I have to learn?

1021
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,768
How to make friends.

1022
01:14:16,931 --> 01:14:18,975
- Kids, now!
- Go, go!

1023
01:14:19,143 --> 01:14:20,740
- Okay, kids.
- Come on, kids!

1024
01:14:20,907 --> 01:14:23,335
Go, go! Come on, let's go get him.

1025
01:14:24,051 --> 01:14:25,264
No bodily harm.

1026
01:14:25,430 --> 01:14:27,705
Move, move! Move, move!

1027
01:14:30,723 --> 01:14:34,627
- That's it! No bodily...
- One, two, three, four, five.

1028
01:14:34,796 --> 01:14:36,874
Bye-bye, Biscane. You're walking.

1029
01:14:37,042 --> 01:14:41,143
- Good Biscane ball bashing, Alex.
- Options. I need them quick.

1030
01:14:41,308 --> 01:14:43,320
We can't abort the satellite feed.

1031
01:14:43,489 --> 01:14:45,698
- There's no way to stop him?
- Hey, Kahuna.

1032
01:14:45,863 --> 01:14:47,557
- I've got the answer.
- Well?

1033
01:14:47,723 --> 01:14:51,309
- Every day we get storytime.
- Now's not a good time for baby talk.

1034
01:14:51,476 --> 01:14:54,417
I think I know what he's getting at.
Go on, Archie.

1035
01:14:54,586 --> 01:14:56,696
Every day we have storytime.

1036
01:14:56,865 --> 01:15:00,615
It can be either a bad book
or a good book.

1037
01:15:00,777 --> 01:15:02,691
And we can't stop storytime.

1038
01:15:02,862 --> 01:15:06,766
But we can change the story
from a bad one to a good one.

1039
01:15:06,936 --> 01:15:08,850
I can alter the mind-control message.

1040
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:12,509
Instead of being robbed of their
free will, we just turn it around.

1041
01:15:12,677 --> 01:15:14,951
And crank up the free will.

1042
01:15:15,115 --> 01:15:16,580
No. No, no!

1043
01:15:16,751 --> 01:15:18,795
No, you'll ruin everything.

1044
01:15:19,092 --> 01:15:21,816
Switch the mind-control message
to freedom control.

1045
01:15:21,979 --> 01:15:24,286
They don't have to sit
and watch TV all day.

1046
01:15:24,449 --> 01:15:26,821
- Will it work?
- There's one way to find out.

1047
01:15:26,983 --> 01:15:29,837
All right, Archie, hit the switch.
Now.

1048
01:15:32,852 --> 01:15:34,996
What're we watching
this lame frog for?

1049
01:15:35,161 --> 01:15:36,211
He's boring.

1050
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:39,803
- Let's go outside and play.
- Okay. Let's play tag. You're it.

1051
01:15:43,175 --> 01:15:44,355
We got it!

1052
01:15:46,446 --> 01:15:48,940
Way to go, kids!

1053
01:15:49,141 --> 01:15:52,695
I may have lost the battle,
but I will win the war.

1054
01:15:52,862 --> 01:15:54,360
I'll get this one!

1055
01:15:54,530 --> 01:15:55,579
Not so fast, Billy.

1056
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:01,421
- That was pretty good.
- Thank you.

1057
01:16:03,318 --> 01:16:04,915
That's my bad leg.

1058
01:16:09,348 --> 01:16:10,496
Oh, my God.

1059
01:16:15,186 --> 01:16:18,357
"To realize the power
of your true self, press this button."

1060
01:16:18,971 --> 01:16:21,847
This is how they became
their superselves. It's time...

1061
01:16:22,018 --> 01:16:24,959
...for the real me to emerge.

1062
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:26,924
Here I come!

1063
01:16:36,895 --> 01:16:38,655
Oh, no.

1064
01:16:38,819 --> 01:16:42,176
I hate babies.

1065
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:45,585
- I hated being a baby.
- Don't you worry, little Billy.

1066
01:16:45,748 --> 01:16:47,695
I'll feed you.
I'll take care of you.

1067
01:16:47,865 --> 01:16:49,429
I'll even change your diaper.

1068
01:16:49,597 --> 01:16:51,292
I'm warning you, Crowe.

1069
01:16:51,457 --> 01:16:54,530
I'm Bill Biscane. If you touch
my diapers, you're fired.

1070
01:16:54,697 --> 01:16:58,535
- Oh, you dear boy.
- Put me down. I can drool by myself.

1071
01:16:58,706 --> 01:16:59,953
Put me down.

1072
01:17:00,117 --> 01:17:03,671
This has gotta be the most
amazing day in history.

1073
01:17:04,351 --> 01:17:07,008
And you have a lot
of explaining to do.

1074
01:17:07,174 --> 01:17:09,701
- Well, where do I start?
- From the beginning.

1075
01:17:09,868 --> 01:17:11,180
You wanna hear the story?

1076
01:17:11,343 --> 01:17:14,613
Okay, guys. It's time for me
to pack up and move on.

1077
01:17:14,775 --> 01:17:17,717
Maybe someday we could beat
some bad guys up together...

1078
01:17:17,887 --> 01:17:20,380
...and then we'd get
a chocolate shake after.

1079
01:17:20,549 --> 01:17:24,037
Deep down we both know, kids,
if that stroller leaves from here...

1080
01:17:24,205 --> 01:17:27,858
...and you're not on it, you'll regret it.
Maybe not today...

1081
01:17:28,023 --> 01:17:31,676
...maybe not tomorrow, but soon,
and for the rest of your lives.

1082
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:34,274
You don't have to leave.

1083
01:17:35,689 --> 01:17:39,527
You don't have to go away.
You can come live with us.

1084
01:17:39,698 --> 01:17:41,524
You know I can't do that.

1085
01:17:41,687 --> 01:17:44,026
- Why not?
- Kid...

1086
01:17:44,189 --> 01:17:48,541
I wanna work side by side
with my best friend, Kahuna.

1087
01:17:48,711 --> 01:17:51,050
We'll always be friends.

1088
01:17:51,213 --> 01:17:53,520
Wait a second.
None of this is making sense.

1089
01:17:53,682 --> 01:17:54,962
- Go back...
- Wait a minute.

1090
01:17:55,126 --> 01:17:57,040
Is Kahuna leaving?

1091
01:17:57,211 --> 01:18:00,635
I'll tell you something, Arch,
something I think you already know.

1092
01:18:00,804 --> 01:18:03,395
- What's that?
- You got a couple of real heroes...

1093
01:18:03,562 --> 01:18:04,611
...at home.

1094
01:18:09,047 --> 01:18:10,577
Yeah.

1095
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:12,921
Yeah, I really do.

1096
01:18:14,435 --> 01:18:16,775
- Who's the big hero?
- Daddy! I love you.

1097
01:18:16,937 --> 01:18:18,369
Who's Daddy's little hero?

1098
01:18:18,541 --> 01:18:19,787
Take care, my friends.

1099
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,420
- Say, "Bye, Kahuna."
- Bye.

1100
01:18:22,583 --> 01:18:25,010
- Bye, Kahuna.
- Bye, Kahuna.

1101
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:26,908
I'm gonna miss you.

1102
01:18:30,024 --> 01:18:31,916
Bye, Kahuna.

1103
01:18:32,398 --> 01:18:34,891
The consumer report
also stated that sales...

1104
01:18:35,059 --> 01:18:38,898
...of children's books, music and toys
have tripled since last month.

1105
01:18:39,069 --> 01:18:41,245
And the phenomenon continues.

1106
01:18:41,411 --> 01:18:45,129
For the second straight month,
television ratings have plummeted.

1107
01:18:45,291 --> 01:18:49,906
Children are spending more time
outdoors, in sports, and reading.

1108
01:18:50,071 --> 01:18:53,756
Elsewhere in the news, a busload
of children in Mexico were saved...

1109
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:57,189
...when their runaway school bus
nearly plunged over a cliff.

1110
01:18:57,352 --> 01:19:00,621
While the trauma of the incident
caused young witnesses...

1111
01:19:00,783 --> 01:19:05,202
...to claim some sort of superbaby
saved the bus, experts believe...

1112
01:19:05,371 --> 01:19:08,477
...that atmospheric conditions...
- Hey, buddy.

1113
01:19:11,112 --> 01:19:12,904
You miss him, don't you?

1114
01:19:14,223 --> 01:19:17,099
I'm the bogeyman. I'm the bogeyman.
Bogeyman. Bogeyman.

1115
01:19:17,271 --> 01:19:19,480
You're the booger-man, you are.

1116
01:19:19,644 --> 01:19:22,071
Oh, that's not cool, Rosita.

1117
01:19:23,814 --> 01:19:25,094
Zack?

1118
01:19:28,432 --> 01:19:30,772
There's somebody here to see you.

1119
01:19:45,336 --> 01:19:47,928
Are you my... My mother?

1120
01:19:49,313 --> 01:19:52,387
- Mom, this is my friend, Kylie.
- Hi.

1121
01:19:52,553 --> 01:19:54,630
Kylie, this is my...

1122
01:19:55,696 --> 01:19:57,227
My mother.

1123
01:20:05,415 --> 01:20:07,624
Yay, Zack!

1124
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:26,262
Kahuna.

1125
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:29,145
Hey, Archie.

1126
01:20:31,845 --> 01:20:34,502
You're a full-fledged
Junior Kahuna now.

1127
01:20:34,668 --> 01:20:36,297
That's official.

1128
01:20:36,817 --> 01:20:39,310
- See you.
- Look after everybody.

1129
01:20:39,928 --> 01:20:41,842
I'll be seeing you.

1130
01:20:42,269 --> 01:20:44,696
I got an emergency
over in Europe.

1131
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:47,809
But I'll be back!
