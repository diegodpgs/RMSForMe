1
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,633
Valhalla, this is Thor.
Valhalla, this is Thor.

2
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,007
<i>We have visual on a</i>
<i>possible high-value target.</i>

3
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:13,705
Thor, this is Valhalla.

4
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:17,299
We're seeking positive ID
on target traveling in convoy

5
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,470
and we're pushing
more assets your way.

6
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:23,741
Contact Loki on secondary net.

7
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,784
Loki, this is Thor.

8
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:30,015
<i>Target is located at grid coordinates</i>
<i>two-four-Tango-Kilo-Bravo</i>

9
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:33,456
<i>one-two-four-five-six-seven-three-niner.</i>

10
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,289
<i>Confirm you have visual.</i>

11
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:36,760
Verifying target ID.

12
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,888
Electro-optic and
infrared sensors are online.

13
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,466
- Confirming target.
- SecDef is arriving now.

14
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,008
Mr. Secretary, this way, sir.

15
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,008
Attempting cell phone link
to moving target.

16
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,984
Stand by for data feed.

17
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:05,222
Stand by for audio.

18
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,519
Got it.

19
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:11,961
Now, don't tell me you spotted the beard
in the middle of a goddamn sandstorm.

20
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:15,296
- Is it really him?
- We're confirming that now, sir.

21
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:16,425
Sir, audio is coming up now.

22
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:19,699
- Verifying voice pattern match.
- What do we have here, Sergeant?

23
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:24,168
Four males. One of them is speaking
in a Rakhshani dialect,

24
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,871
consistent with our intel on al-Khoei.

25
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,212
Sir, it's just coming up.

26
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,844
"Thirty-seven percent" and "probable"
don't belong in the same sentence.

27
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,478
I'm not taking this to the President.

28
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,649
<i>CIA and NCTC concur it is the target,</i>

29
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,556
<i>based on reliable intel from the Brits.</i>

30
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,959
They're pulling off the highway.

31
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,571
Criteria is not met. Recommend abort.

32
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,444
We have an abort recommendation.

33
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,316
If it's him, this guy comes out of hiding
every couple of years at best.

34
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,854
Sir, target is appearing
around the northeast corner.

35
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,893
We've got AK-47 s,
RPGs and Chaparral guided missiles.

36
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:18,759
This is a training camp, Mr. Secretary.

37
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:22,164
- Wait. Wait. Print. 51%.
- 51%.

38
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:25,135
- Abort rec still holds.
- All other PID options exhausted.

39
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,536
What do you suggest we do, sir?

40
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,007
Is that a weapons cache?

41
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,101
Sir, the placement of
the stones around the pit,

42
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,774
marker for the five pillars of Islam.
I think it's a funeral.

43
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,248
For Christ's sake.

44
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:42,412
Counsel, how many ways would this
violate the Geneva Convention?

45
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,456
We can invoke <i>hors de combat.</i>

46
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,526
There's no independent intel verifying
that this is, in fact, a funeral.

47
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,858
Signal's got the President
from Air Force One, sir.

48
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:00,634
Mr. President,

49
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,574
we have a 51% identity match
on Majid al-Khoei.

50
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:08,169
<i>The bad news is, there's</i>
<i>some possibility he's at a funeral.</i>

51
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:11,944
You should also be aware
we have an abort recommendation.

52
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:14,611
But the Joint Chiefs are urging a go.

53
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,015
<i>All right, what's your recommendation?</i>

54
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:28,123
Sir, we measure success by
the least amount of collateral damage.

55
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:33,202
At 51% probability, the risk is too high.

56
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:38,972
<i>And if it is al-Khoei and he walks,</i>
<i>I'm putting our people at risk.</i>

57
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,446
<i>You have a go.</i>

58
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,211
Thank you, Mr. President.

59
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,285
- We're weapons hot!
- We have weapons hot!

60
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,793
- Loki, you are cleared to engage.
- Repeat, weapons hot. PID.

61
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:59,228
We have handshake with the
MQ9 Reaper. Sending you images now.

62
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:02,733
- Loki, target coordinates received.
- Yes, sir. Switching to IR sensor.

63
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,642
Target is lased.

64
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,311
Master arm on.

65
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,907
Missiles away.

66
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,987
Ten seconds to impact.

67
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,141
You got to make a choice, fellas.

68
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:54,776
Who are you going to be? Boys or men?

69
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,624
- I'm out on this one.
- Why?

70
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:02,092
- 'Cause I'm broke.
- Come...

71
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,822
How do I know you don't have
something great under there?

72
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,329
Kwame just paired the board.
I'm floating on the river here.

73
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:06,523
Look at the table.

74
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:09,499
I don't know. I'm supposed to take my
girl out later. It's a lot of money.

75
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:12,730
Your girl out? Who's that?

76
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,329
- Elaine?
- Yeah.

77
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,499
You guys have been going out
for a while.

78
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:17,974
How long?

79
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:20,341
- Couple months.
- Couple months? Wow.

80
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:23,609
- That's big. You have sex with her yet?
- Kinda.

81
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,047
- What the hell is "kinda"?
- "Kinda"?

82
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,379
- Personal question.
- Okay, well, listen.

83
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,750
Let me ask you a question.
What are you going to do tonight?

84
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:29,822
Fish filet and a Coke?

85
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,549
Go to Blockbuster,
rent a little romantic comedy,

86
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,318
go back to Mom's house,
sit on the couch?

87
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,757
- How'd you know?
- Well, that's what you do.

88
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,522
You're a dependable person.
That's what you're going to do.

89
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,221
You know what you should do?

90
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,629
You need to lay down some real green
and treat your lady right.

91
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,598
You know, you need to take her
to a nice place.

92
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,830
Red Lobster. Olive Garden.
Tablecloths. Soft music.

93
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,906
And then you skip
this Blockbuster thing.

94
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,999
Girls want to go out. Especially a girl
as cute as your girl, you know?

95
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,101
She wants to be seen.
That's why she dresses up.

96
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,736
So you take her to the movies.

97
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,371
- A little popcorn-drink combo.
- True. True.

98
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:59,474
Elaine might want a hot dog and some
nachos, so you shell out for that, too.

99
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,984
And then before you know it,

100
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,281
she's cozying up
the way she never would've

101
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,480
at her mom's house, you know?

102
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,988
- Preach it. Preach it.
- Now all of a sudden, look.

103
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,457
Gino Romero's walking tall
with Elaine yank-my-Dickinson,

104
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,460
- all because he dared to dream tonight.
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

105
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:10,756
And he became a man.
And that's the choice.

106
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,387
- Yes.
- And that's what's on the table.

107
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,898
This is the dream right here.

108
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,366
Are you a man?

109
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,629
- I'm with you.
- Okay, here we go.

110
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:18,999
- I'm with you. Twenty?
- Twenty.

111
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,538
Big boy game.

112
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,401
Call.

113
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,070
- Cowboys over aces, big Jer.
- Wow. Wow.

114
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,668
- Didn't see that coming, huh?
- Yeah, that's a tough one.

115
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,872
This is a tough one, too.
Four bullets, baby.

116
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,677
Get out of here!
You baited me into that, Jer. Come on!

117
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,775
- That's the way it goes.
- So what happened to Red Lobster?

118
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,478
No, I guess it's Mama's house
for you tonight.

119
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:36,816
But look, I saved you 40 bucks.

120
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:40,381
And now Elaine won't have to shell out
for herpes medication.

121
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,825
Break's over, bitches.
Freitag missed his shift again.

122
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,089
- Someone's on collator duty.
- Great.

123
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,062
All right, well, gentlemen,

124
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,998
I'll give you a chance to win some of
this back tomorrow. Enjoy yourselves.

125
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:50,591
All right, man.

126
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,569
Hey there. Welcome to Copy Cabana.
How can I help you?

127
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,839
I couldn't get the machine
past the main menu.

128
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,574
- That machine there?
- Yeah.

129
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,650
Did you swipe your credit card
to the left, sir?

130
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,513
- Didn't do that.
- Well, that's your problem.

131
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:07,608
Why don't you try it again?

132
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,188
<i>Cell phone users, beware.</i>

133
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:24,497
<i>The Federal Bureau of Investigation</i>

Yes.

Jerry?

147
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,517
Mrs. Wierzbowski! I was just...
I thought you might have been sleeping.

148
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,021
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- So... But I have...

149
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:52,954
I have some rent here.

150
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,186
- Here you go.
- Yeah, some is good. All is better.

151
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,159
Well, that's most of it. Here.

152
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,560
$1, $1, $1...

153
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,222
No, no, no. Look. Here's a five there.

154
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,494
- Five.
- Yeah.

155
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,593
Where is girl? I don't see her no more.

156
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,934
You know you're the only woman for me.

157
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,836
No, that's done. She got smart.

158
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,841
- Like the others.
- Yeah. Yeah.

159
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:15,570
Is woman friend? Answer.
Then see if she give you money for rent.

160
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,348
One second.

161
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,948
Hey, Mom.

162
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:25,949
What?

163
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,753
- Looks just like him.
- I'm not him.

164
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:38,418
Six months without a boo or a bah, huh?

165
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,082
Yes, sir.

166
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,319
So where were you this time?

167
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:48,165
Alaska. Singapore.
I got a job there.

168
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:55,333
I... I spoke to Stanford.

169
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,408
I pulled some strings.

170
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,306
They said they'd take you back.
Even though you took off...

171
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,604
Two years ago, Dad.

172
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:03,375
Jerry, you know, it wouldn't kill you
to ask for help once in a while.

173
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:04,710
You want to have
this conversation now?

174
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:05,977
- It's Stanford!
- You want to do this today.

175
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,052
You know how many people would kill...

176
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,314
- Today? You want to have this now?
- Fine.

177
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:12,652
You do whatever you want.
You always have.

178
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:23,529
You know, I keep thinking,
I'm going to walk in here one day

179
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:28,205
and I'm not going to feel
like a stranger in my own house.

180
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,419
I don't want your money.

181
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:11,508
<i>Can I have your attention, please?</i>

182
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:15,951
<i>Smoking is not permitted on the train.</i>
<i>Chicago is next.</i>

183
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,508
Can't find the keys
and he's late as usual.

184
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,637
- I'm going to have to take you.
- He'll be here.

185
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,539
All right, wait five more minutes.

186
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,675
Help me out here.
We came home last night.

187
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:49,618
I put the leftovers down.
You turned on the TV. I went over,

188
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,351
said, "No TV, no TV, no TV."
Turned it off.

189
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:54,551
Came over here.

190
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,628
- Checked the messages.
- Knocked over the phone.

191
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,129
Right, knocked over the phone.
Put it back.

192
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,563
Put the leftovers in the fridge.

193
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,460
Let's go!

194
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,835
I put vitamins in your toiletry bag.
Don't forget to take...

195
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,602
- Two in the morning and two at night.
- That's right.

196
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:11,698
And your inhaler's
in the back of your bag.

197
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,868
- Sammy!
- Daddy!

198
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:15,538
Come here. You didn't think
I'd miss the big send-off, do you, huh?

199
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:16,910
Let's get you on this train.

200
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,677
- This must be your...
- Trumpet.

201
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,718
My God, this weighs, like, 200 pounds.
You carry this yourself?

202
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,514
- Mr. and Mrs. Holloman!
- Miss.

203
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,213
- You just made it.
- Right.

204
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,790
- Here, Sam.
- Thanks.

205
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:26,880
- Listen to me.
- I have one more here.

206
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,790
All these other kids, right? They're
going to call their moms, too, all right?

207
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:31,522
They're just going to lie about it.

208
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,531
All right, and eat junk food 'cause this is
your one chance, but brush your teeth.

209
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:37,864
Mom, you got to stop.
I'm going to miss you, too.

210
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,562
<i>Capitol Limited to D.C. is</i>
<i>departing now.</i>

211
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:40,764
Give me a hug.

212
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:41,862
<i>All aboard.</i>

213
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,942
- I love you so much.
- I love you, too.

214
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,568
- Shine bright, okay?
- Okay.

215
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,678
Rock the house, buddy.
You're going to be great. Okay?

216
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,045
- Okay.
- I'll see you later.

217
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,779
- Bye!
- Have fun in D. C!

218
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,549
- Bye, Mom!
- Your mom going to be okay?

219
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,089
It's unclear.

220
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,317
I'm so sorry. I got stuck in traffic,

221
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,554
- and I didn't even...
- Don't even say it.

222
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,229
All aboard!

223
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,601
Yes. Five-nine-one-three.

224
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,671
It's here. It's here.

225
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:21,376
Okay, okay.

226
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,858
- Come on!
- Two seconds. Sorry.

227
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:48,701
No, wait.

228
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,350
- Hey, hang on a second.
- Sorry.

229
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:00,679
- You're dropping money.
- Sir, sir!

230
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,516
Big date, you know?
Fingers crossed, huh?

231
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,822
- Here you go. Have a good day!
- Thank you.

232
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,321
- Jerry!
- What?

233
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,297
- So many boxes.
- Boxes?

234
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,869
I had to open your room.
All day they come.

235
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,369
- Big boxes, small boxes.
- My boxes?

236
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:20,836
I don't know.
Whose boxes would they be?

237
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,271
- All right, okay.
- Look at them there. See in there?

238
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,740
- See, I put them all...
- Yeah. Yeah.

239
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,606
- Listen, I have something for you here.
- Yeah.

240
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,771
This is rent for this month
and next month, too, okay?

241
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,576
- Oh, my.
- Thank you.

242
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,190
Hello?

243
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,884
<i>The FBI will arrive</i>
<i>at your apartment in 30 seconds.</i>

244
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,585
<i>You must flee the premises.</i>

245
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:50,855
Who... Who is this?

246
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,487
<i>You've been activated, Jerry.</i>

247
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,429
- Who the hell is this?
<i>- Your compliance is vital.</i>

248
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55,500
How did you get this number?

249
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:58,502
<i>You now have 24 seconds.</i>
<i>Leave your residence.</i>

250
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:02,165
<i>Your destination, the Mathis train</i>
<i>station. We will guide you from there.</i>

251
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,298
What is this?

252
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,569
<i>The evidence in your</i>
<i>apartment is irrefutable.</i>

253
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:06,666
- Listen.
<i>- 17 seconds.</i>

254
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:07,745
I'm going to hang this phone up now.

255
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:09,074
<i>They'll seek your arrest</i>
<i>for conspiracy, treason...</i>

256
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,206
- I'm hanging this phone up now!
<i>...violating state and local law.</i>

257
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,147
- You tell me how you got this number!
<i>- Maximum penalty, death.</i>

258
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,243
No, none of this is mine!

259
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:20,655
FBI, FBI, FBI! Get down on the floor!

260
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,420
Get on the ground!

261
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:25,324
Down now! Get down!

262
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,728
- I didn't do anything!
- Get down!

263
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,993
- Listen!
- Don't move.

264
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,467
It's not mine! It's not mine!

265
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,911
This is obviously
some sort of mistake, right?

266
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,918
I mean, I don't know
what I'm doing in this room, sir.

267
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,045
It's cold as hell outside.

268
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,454
- You draw?
- I what?

269
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,121
Do you draw? Do you sketch?
You have ink all over your fingers.

270
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,923
Look, you know you got
the wrong guy, right?

271
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,365
I mean,
this is all some kind of sick joke.

272
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:05,663
- I don't know what I'm doing here.
- Obviously.

273
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,797
Obviously you have
nothing to do with it, yeah.

274
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:11,466
Did you love your brother?

275
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:15,473
Or did you hate him?
Did you admire him?

276
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,214
Was your brother patriotic,
would you say?

277
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,754
When's the last time you saw him?

278
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,790
- Christmas.
- This past Christmas?

279
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,290
- Three Christmases ago.
- Three years, huh?

280
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,994
Well, the phone records show that you
haven't even called him in over a year.

281
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:40,867
So no text messages?
No smoke signals?

282
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,440
No MySpace or Facebook messages?

283
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,065
Yeah, so what are you trying to say?
We're not...

284
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:45,302
Are you asking if we're the type of twins

285
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,904
that wear the same shirt to the mall,
hold hands, and things like that? No.

286
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,045
- Sir, I don't even know your name.
- I'm sorry, that was rude of me.

287
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:54,311
I'm Tom Morgan,

288
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,877
the Supervising Agent assigned
to the Joint Terrorism Task Force.

289
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,657
You think I'm a terrorist?

290
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:04,919
No, you're a copy boy, aren't you?

291
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,624
- I'm a copy associate.
- Copy associate.

292
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:09,698
But your brother,

293
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:13,999
it says here he was a little more,
I guess you'd say, ambitious than you.

294
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,199
Graduated from
the Air Force Academy at 21,

295
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,937
with an advanced degree in parallel
algorithms and quantum electronics.

296
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,275
I don't even know what the hell
that stuff means. Do you?

297
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,872
Cadet wing commander, valedictorian,
plum job in the Public Affairs...

298
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,644
Yeah, no, I know what he did, sir.

299
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,219
Why'd you drop out of school, Jerry?

300
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,686
Did your brother have
any influence on that decision?

301
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,120
No, school just wasn't for me.

302
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,692
No, I mean, who would want
a Stanford education anyway?

303
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,762
More upward mobility
at Copy Cabana, I guess, right?

304
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:41,959
I see you did a little backpacking.
Singapore, Bali, Indonesia.

305
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,364
Did odd jobs here and there.
So you've been around.

306
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,526
Look, none of this has anything to do

307
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,763
with any of the shit
that was in my apartment.

308
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:48,965
Why would I send it to myself?
My name is on the lease.

309
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:51,201
I'd have to be the dumbest terrorist
in the history of the world.

310
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,743
So who deposited the 750?

311
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:56,109
The...
I don't know who deposited the 750!

312
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:57,545
God maybe? I thought it was a miracle,

313
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,810
I took the money. That was my mistake.
It was an accident.

314
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:01,681
Do accidents not happen
in your universe?

315
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:05,723
Well, the money originated
from the YTBC Bank of...

316
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,792
Well, I'll be darned, Singapore.

317
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,726
Opened with a transfer from
a corporation called The Star of Orion,

318
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,059
- a dummy front for Hezbollah.
- This is all very interesting, sir.

319
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:16,191
- It has nothing to do with me.
- We find hardware in your apartment.

320
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:18,166
Latest military spec.

321
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,498
- Airplane manuals.
- I told you about this already.

322
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:22,266
And 1,200 pounds
of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.

323
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:23,363
I walked into my apartment...

324
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,136
You planning on becoming
a farmer or something?

325
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,609
I walk into my apartment,
I open the door,

326
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:28,907
and this shit's all over my apartment.

327
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,413
- It just showed up.
- It just showed up.

328
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,382
I see. I'm just curious
if your brother knew anything about it.

329
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:37,581
Of course, we haven't really established
how close you guys were yet, have we?

330
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,487
Well, we were pretty close this morning
when I buried his body in the ground.

331
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,157
Does that establish anything for you?
Somebody set me up.

332
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:44,558
Why is that so hard
for you to understand?

333
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,130
- "Somebody."
- A woman called me on the phone.

334
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:47,323
She told me I was going to be arrested.

335
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:48,797
"A woman." Your mom? Who?

336
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,427
I don't know! If I knew, I would tell you!
I don't know!

337
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:57,933
Here's the thing, Jerry.

338
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,206
This is a bad time to be
in the terrorism business.

339
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,008
You read the paper.

340
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,250
Who do you think is winning?

341
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:11,186
Your Miranda rights or my right to keep
you in this room as long as I want to?

342
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:14,122
I don't care if you tell me
the truth about your brother.

343
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,456
I don't care who you work for.

344
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:22,090
'Cause no matter what you tell me,
you're in a shitload of trouble, son.

345
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,308
This is insane. I work for Copy Cabana.

346
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,469
Yeah, that's what you said.

347
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,413
Listen, I get one night out
in a decade, ladies,

348
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,546
I am not wasting it on Lemon Drops.

349
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:46,749
- Okay.
- Buck up. Let's go.

350
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:53,698
Oh, gosh.

351
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:57,597
I want updates. Catfights, booty calls,
somebody tell me they got lucky.

352
00:23:57,702 --> 00:24:01,832
Hey, ladies. See that guy over there?
He'd like to buy you a round.

353
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,265
Hell, no.
He's got light beer written all over him.

354
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,469
- He's cute.
- Come on.

355
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:07,636
He's a suit. No.

356
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:08,974
You sure?

357
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,411
- Come on.
- Who is it?

358
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:14,208
The one man in my life
who hasn't let me down.

359
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:18,413
- That's sweet.
- All right, don't drink those without me.

360
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:20,617
Hello?

361
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:22,420
Hello?

362
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:27,092
<i>There's a McDonald's across the street.</i>
<i>Look in the window.</i>

363
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,257
What is this?

364
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:30,960
<i>Would you risk your life for your son?</i>

365
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:39,476
<i>Rachel Holloman,</i>
<i>you've been activated.</i>

366
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:41,341
- This isn't funny.
<i>- Your compliance is vital.</i>

367
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:43,437
- Who are you?
<i>- We will derail his train,</i>

368
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:45,140
<i>unless you do what you're told.</i>

369
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,217
What is this?

370
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,115
<i>Don't go back inside the restaurant.</i>

371
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,711
- What?
<i>- There's a black Porsche Cayenne</i>

372
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,552
<i>parked at the northeast corner</i>
<i>of this block.</i>

373
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,889
<i>The keys are in the ignition.</i>
<i>Start walking.</i>

374
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:00,896
Oh, my God.

375
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:06,036
<i>911.</i>
<i>State the nature of your emergency.</i>

376
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:09,129
Yeah, some woman just called me.
I have... I have no idea who she is.

377
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:11,232
She was telling me that...

378
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:19,582
<i>Your phone is being monitored.</i>
<i>Disobey again and your son dies.</i>

379
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:26,250
Hey, Grant, I can't read this Shaw file.

380
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,326
- Grant!
- Excuse me.

381
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,693
Listen, my eyes aren't getting any better
and these screens are getting smaller.

382
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:33,286
Could you please find me
something I can read?

383
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:34,865
I can make the text bigger
on your screen.

384
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:36,456
No, no, no. I'm talking about paper.

385
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:37,933
Remember, like in the olden times?

386
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,560
- Paper. Okay.
- Yeah.

387
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:42,538
Agent Morgan. Zoe Perez,
Air Force Special Investigations.

388
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:45,075
Ethan Shaw, the twin,
he was one of ours.

389
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:47,838
Yeah.
OSI said they were sending a liaison.

390
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:49,675
Can you walk and talk
at the same time?

391
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,043
I'll do my best.

392
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,014
File says he died in a traffic accident.

393
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:56,918
Truck ran a light, corner of
Constitution and 10th, Northwest D.C.

394
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,320
So truck ran a light,
his brother gets 750 large

395
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,585
and enough hardware
to start his own Costco,

396
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:04,127
five hours after enemy
chatter hits the roof.

397
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,094
I mean, don't you find that
a little coincidental?

398
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:10,861
<i>What if it's a decoy? To distract us from</i>
<i>something 50 times bigger.</i>

399
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,550
- Time for your phone call.
- I thought I didn't get one.

400
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,551
Attorney General's office
changed their mind.

401
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,652
Ethan Shaw had a 183 IQ

402
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,055
and yet you had him
as a mid-level press flak.

403
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,718
Why not IT or cyber-warfare?

404
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:38,887
Are you suggesting
that he was overqualified?

405
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,363
Or that he was somehow slipping intel
to the Copy Cabana?

406
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:43,263
No, I'm suggesting
that maybe Ethan Shaw

407
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:47,464
was a superstar rocket scientist genius
who did go wrong,

408
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:51,133
and the Air Force doesn't want
their dirty laundry flapping in the wind.

409
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:54,973
Think what you like, but I need to get in
that room and interrogate him myself.

410
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,069
No.

411
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:07,154
You don't have a choice. Look.

412
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:10,352
Now, neither of us know if either of
those brothers are guilty or innocent,

413
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:15,126
so on behalf of the Secretary
of the Air Force, I'm going in that room.

414
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,663
Well, on behalf of
all that fucking bomb equipment

415
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,762
in junior pinhead's apartment,
no, you're not.

416
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:34,582
<i>We told you to run.</i>
<i>We have planned your escape.</i>

417
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,586
How'd you get on this phone?
Who are you?

418
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,519
<i>Lay flat on the floor immediately.</i>

419
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:40,022
What the...
What the hell are you talking about?

420
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,251
<i>Four seconds, Jerry.</i>

421
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,520
- No, this is bullshit. I don't...
<i>- Get down now.</i>

422
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:45,020
<i>Two seconds.</i>

423
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,175
No!

424
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:15,525
- No! I didn't do this!
- Get down!

425
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,965
Shit.

426
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,063
<i>Standing passengers,</i>
<i>please do not lean against the doors.</i>

427
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:08,043
<i>... fourteen Americans dead</i>
<i>throughout Europe and the Middle East,</i>

428
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,979
<i>with terror groups insisting</i>
<i>this is just the beginning</i>

429

<i>outside the small town of Abda,</i>

00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:20,654
<i>near the border of Afghanistan.</i>

432
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:35,772
<i>Stay on the train for three more stations</i>
<i>and wait at the bottom of the platform.</i>

433
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:37,603
<i>You will receive...</i>

434
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:04,829
<i>Doors closing. Standing passengers,</i>
<i>please do not lean against the doors.</i>

435

- Help!
- Jimmy.

436
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:36,666
My baby. I need some help. Somebody.

437
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:38,360
- What?
<i>- You're not listening.</i>

438
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:40,130
<i>We told you to stay on the train.</i>

439
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:42,934
- How are you doing this?
<i>- Next stop is Wilson Station.</i>

440
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,771
<i>A black Porsche Cayenne will be</i>
<i>waiting at the northwest exit.</i>

441
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,344
- Listen.
<i>- Get in the passenger seat.</i>

442
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:49,970
Listen! No, I'm done.

443
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:55,282
- Hello?
<i>- The man in front of the exit door</i>

444
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:57,877
<i>in a black coat is a wanted terrorist.</i>

445
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:01,083
<i>- His name is Jerry Shaw.</i>
- Who is this?

446
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:04,851
- You Jerry Shaw?
- No, no, no.

447
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:06,954
<i>Wilson Station. Exit now.</i>

448
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:08,932
That's the guy!

449
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,836
I said, are you Jerry Shaw?
Hey! Come here!

450
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:37,256
Watch it!

451
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,598
- Drive the car! Drive the car!
- No!

452
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:45,293
- I did what you asked me to do!
- I'm not going anywhere...

453
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,870
- You tell... Stop!
...until you tell me my son's safe!

454
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:48,871
Who's your son?
I don't know what you're talking about!

455
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,964
- I'll kill you if you hurt my son!
- I almost died over this shit!

456
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,838
- Listen, lady, I don't know who...
- Tell me Sam is safe!

457
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:54,343
Who is... Will you stop hitting me?

458
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:57,039
Are you the woman
who called me on the phone?

459
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:59,480
- Did you call me on the phone?
- No. The woman.

460
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,051
- She called you, too?
- She called you, too?

461
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:02,380
<i>Drive.</i>

462
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:07,347
Get out! Now! Get out of the vehicle!

463
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,019
Stop!

464
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,629
- Why is this happening?
- Go, go, go, go, go!

465
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:21,637
Who are you and
why are people shooting at us?

466
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:24,105
Drive the car! Clutch!

467
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:27,769
<i>Accelerate. Turn right, 200 feet.</i>
<i>You have pursuers.</i>

468
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:30,677
- Yeah, no shit! Who are you?
<i>- No questions.</i>

469
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:33,116
<i>Turn right now.</i>

470
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,085
So you don't know anything about Sam?

471
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:43,092
What, you mean your son?
No, I know nothing.

472
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:44,161
Just like you don't know how to drive.

473
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,923
Use the clutch before you shift,
not while you shift!

474
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,088
I don't need driving lessons
from you, asshole!

475
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:49,098
What, you drive like this
and I'm the asshole?

476
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,667
<i>Turn left now.</i>

477
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:02,175
All units. Suspect in a Porsche
Cayenne heading west on Grand.

478
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,874
- All units respond, Code 3.
- There!

479
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:14,684
<i>Maintain a speed of 50 miles an hour.</i>
<i>Stay in the second lane from the right.</i>

480
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:17,192
- The light's red!
<i>- Accelerate now.</i>

481
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,766
Get me a roadblock
at Granville and Sheridan.

482
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,102
Oh, shit.

483
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:36,978
The lights are all turning green.

484
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:42,917
Holy shit!

485
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,691
- Holy...
- Shit!

486
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,707
Get in close.

487
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,175
Go, go, go!

488
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,745
- Shit!
<i>- Brake. Brake now.</i>

489
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:14,817
Get in here!

490
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:26,956
<i>Accelerate to 60 miles per hour.</i>

491
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,229
Clutch. Clutch!

492
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,033
- Use the clutch!
- I'm clutching!

493
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:35,605
I'm watching, you're not clutching!

494
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:40,935
- Stop!
- I'm not stopping.

495
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:45,045
Slow down. Slow down, the light's red.

496
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:48,175
<i>Don't slow down.</i>
<i>Accelerate to 72 miles per hour.</i>

497
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:50,186
- Slow down. It's a red light!
<i>- You will make it through.</i>

498
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:51,721
- Stop!
- No way.

499
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,048
- Brake!
- I can't!

500
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,455
- Brake!
- Stop!

501
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,209
<i>Manual control's been restored.</i>

502
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:20,682
<i>Continue straight</i>
<i>until you reach Pier 15.</i>

503
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:31,258
<i>Enter the wrecking yard.</i>
<i>Proceed to the end of the dock.</i>

504
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:34,092
<i>We will eliminate all obstacles for you.</i>

505
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,603
Watch! Watch! Watch!

506
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:16,773
<i>- Stay your course.</i>
- Turn!

507
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,503
- Turn!
<i>- Turn right now.</i>

508
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:38,695
Holy...

509
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,342
Oh, God.

510
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:54,867
Oh, my God!

511
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:00,313
- Grab the seat.
- I can't.

512
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:02,852
- Grab the seat! The seat!
- No, I can't!

513
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:05,889
No!

514
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:21,563
<i>The crane will release the car.</i>
<i>If you do not jump, you will drown.</i>

515
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:24,869
- We have to jump.
- No! No way.

516
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,740
We have to. When I say "go."

517
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:31,470
Ready?

518
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,982
Go! Jump!

519
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:56,263
I want both the divers in that water!

520
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:02,241
- Let's go! Move!
- Let's go, let's go!

521
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:03,574
Move, move, move!

522
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:24,265
- Yeah, I already called it in!
- Wait till it clears!

523
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,394
Thirty feet back, that's it!

524
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:28,938
Yeah, I know,
the Army sent a Black Hawk,

525
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,405
so I'll be there in a couple of hours.

526
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:33,477
What do you mean,
the car is not registered to anyone?

527
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:34,771
Check the VIN number again.

528
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:39,973
<i>Leave your message for Sam,</i>
<i>even though I know it's you, Mom.</i>

529
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:43,347
Sam? Baby, listen to me.

530
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:46,321
You need to call me
as soon as you get this message, okay?

531
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:50,788
Baby, please. I love you.

532
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,493
- What about the girl?
- What?

533
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:56,122
What about the girl?

534
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:58,201
Well, the Department of Transpo
tells me that there was

535
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:00,793
a seven-minute equipment failure
on their traffic cams.

536
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,566
- We didn't get a picture of her.
- Don't tell me that.

537
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,141
- That's what they're telling me!
- I need an ID on that girl.

538
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:10,004
Do you think they could derail a train?

539
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:13,742
They changed every traffic light
to get us here.

540
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,648
The woman, she called me
on a stranger's cell phone

541
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:17,948
who happened to be sitting next to me.
Never met the guy in my life.

542
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:19,989
You know, and then they broke me out
of maximum security custody

543
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,321
in a way I'm not even gonna describe
to you because it sounds crazy,

544
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:26,021
and then they lift us off the face of
the Earth and drop us into this shit pile?

545
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,358
She could probably derail a train.

546
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:29,126
She could probably turn a train
into a talking duck.

547
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,163
And what about these goddamn ghost
cranes that keep helping peewee out?

548
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:36,137
I mean, they don't just lift cars
up in the air all by themselves

549
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,764
like a giant pair of chopsticks.

550
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:40,876
I want to know how these things run,
how they're programmed.

551
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:43,442
What'd you say your name was?

552
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,640
- Rachel.
- I'm Jerry.

553
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:56,051
- Hello?
<i>- The barge will dock in 14 minutes.</i>

554
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,426
<i>Leave the boatyard with the female.</i>
<i>Take Highway 123 East.</i>

555
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:03,125
<i>Walk to mile marker 108.</i>

556
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:07,966
- What? Was it her?
- She called you "the female."

557
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:12,500
Have Mortuary Affairs freeze everything
belonging to Ethan Shaw.

558
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,909
- No personal effects to next of kin.
- You, Due Process!

559
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,844
- Bye.
- What do you have on Ethan Shaw?

560
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:20,644
I have a name. It's Agent Perez.

561
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,946
And I'll answer that question
when I get back from D.C.

562
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:26,454
- Wait a minute. What's in D. C?
- Shaw's private quarters.

563
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:30,459
I need you to stay here.
I'm not losing my link to Ethan Shaw.

564
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:32,586
Maybe I haven't made this clear.

565
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:35,665
I don't work for you.
I work for the Air Force.

566
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,530
Keep your phone on,
I'll keep you updated.

567
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:48,067
If you're staring at me, it better be
because I'm the goddamn suspect.

568
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:51,837
Because if I don't get some good leads
soon, you're all gonna be demoted

569
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,282
into something that's gonna require
touching shit with your hands.

570
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:58,415
Now, let's get going. We got work to do.

571
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:09,691
Hexamethylene.
Our latest chemical explosive.

572
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:15,204
One single tiny crystal,
80 times more powerful than C4.

573
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,638
Odorless, undetectable.

574
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:21,370
<i>And best of all, it can be</i>
<i>cut down in size for stealth operations.</i>

575
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,379
This valve is a sonic trigger.

576
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,745
<i>The sound frequency</i>
<i>triggers the explosion.</i>

577
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,045
Each trigger is programmed
to have a unique

578
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,780
frequency specific
only to one Hex crystal.

579
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,822
<i>That frequency triggers the explosion.</i>

580
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:39,354
<i>Yeah.</i>

581
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,361
We recently received approval
to begin shipping to the field.

582
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:45,264
Two hundred units
are shipping out today.

583
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:08,888
- Sign right here.
- Yeah.

584
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,488
Thank you.

585
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:17,334
<i>The package you've just received</i>
<i>contains a small metal valve.</i>

586
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:18,901
<i>Open the package.</i>

587
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:24,231
- Okay.
<i>- Remove the valve</i>

588
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:26,639
<i>and follow our instructions precisely.</i>

589
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,351
<i>- You've received the package.</i>
<i>- Yes, ma'am, it just arrived.</i>

590
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:40,787
- What kind of stone is this?
<i>- No questions.</i>

591
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,449
<i>Cut the stone and place the setting</i>

592
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,721
<i>according to the specifications</i>
<i>we sent you.</i>

593
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:30,734
<i>I'd just dropped my son off at the train.</i>

594
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:33,674
<i>I was out having drinks with my</i>
<i>girlfriends when the call came.</i>

595
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,371
<i>- What about you?</i>
<i>- The first call came to my apartment.</i>

596
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:38,679
<i>- After the boxes?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

597
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:43,278
Well, then this whole thing's
obviously gotta be about your brother.

598
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:45,480
- Really, it's that obvious, huh?
- I mean, you got all this stuff.

599
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:47,079
The weapons, the cash,
the airplane manuals.

600
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:48,249
- Okay.
- He was your twin.

601
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:49,383
- They sent it to the wrong brother.
- Right.

602
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:50,653
So you're implying
my brother's a terrorist.

603
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:53,355
I'm implying, if not him, then why you?

604
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:01,996
I'm sorry. I know he just died. I'm not
trying to insult his memory or anything.

605
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:04,973
No, he hasn't been dead long enough
to be a memory, Rachel.

606
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,168
If you knew my brother,
you'd laugh all day at the idea

607
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:09,302
that he was a terrorist or a spy
or whatever else you're saying...

608
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:10,505
- How do you know?
- Because he's my brother.

609
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:11,842
That's something you would know
about your brother.

610
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:14,247
Well, when's the last time
you talked to him?

611
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:24,356
I don't need this. Hey, listen. Hey!
I don't have to explain myself to you.

612
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:26,292
- Is your son a terrorist?
- Yeah, my son's a terrorist.

613
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:28,490
Yeah, well, he's just as likely
to be a terrorist as my brother.

614
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:31,227
And let's not forget you in all this. Why
are you here? What's your day job?

615
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,098
- I know it isn't manual shift driver.
- I'm a paralegal.

616
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,233
- I don't have a connection to anything.
- Paralegal?

617
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,569
How do I know you're not lying to me?
What does a paralegal do?

618
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,472
The same thing as the guys
with their names on the door,

619
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:43,012
except I do it for $11 an hour,
so they can bill 200.

620
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:44,478
That nail it for you, Sherlock?

621
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:46,105
That still doesn't explain why
we're walking out here...

622
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:48,480
- I don't know why the hell I'm out here!
- Yeah, I know...

623
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:56,793
Hey!

624
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,592
- Are you Jerry Shaw?
- Who are you?

625
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,098
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- I sent the package like she asked.

626
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,497
- Wait, what package?
- What is that?

627
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:05,863
- Now she wants me to drive you?
- Who, "she"?

628
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:07,334
- I won't. I'm done!
- You know "she"?

629
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:08,496
- Wait.
- Stay right there.

630
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:10,072
- Get back.
- Here. Here's the address.

631
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:13,075
- Why are you attack...
- Here. Here are the keys.

632
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:14,144
Take the goddamn van!

633
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:15,233
- You think I'm going to...
- Who's doing this?

634
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:18,940
...do this because I'm Iranian?
I am American. I'm finished! I'm done!

635
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,540
- What? What are you talking about?
- You take it!

636
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:23,449
- What are you talking about?
- I won't do this because I can't.

637
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,579
- Hello?
<i>- Stop him now, or he will die.</i>

638
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:27,247
Listen to me,
what are you talking about?

639
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:29,325
- You try to do this without me!
- How are you seeing us right now?

640
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:31,587
<i>- Stop him now.</i>
- What is she saying?

641
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:34,061
Stop. Hey! You gotta stop!

642
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:36,997
- Wait!
- You gotta stop!

643
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:13,359
- You killed that man.
<i>- Desertion is not an option.</i>

644
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:16,268
<i>Take the van.</i>
<i>Drive to Indianapolis, Indiana.</i>

645
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:21,106
<i>72 West 56th Street.</i>
<i>Arrive no later than 11:00 a.m.</i>

646
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,485
- Welcome.
- Hello. Agent Perez.

647
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:37,420
- To the right?
- Yes, ma'am.

648
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:40,357
- ID, ma'am.
- OSI.

649
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,058
I ordered a freeze on Ethan Shaw's
personal effects. What's going on?

650
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:44,896
Orders to sanitize came down
from the Two Star.

651
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:46,765
Okay, I'm countermanding.
Thank you. I'll take that.

652
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,030
- Tell your guys to clear out.
- Who are you?

653
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,730
This scene's part of
a federal investigation

654
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,865
with national security ramifications.
This your log?

655
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,533
- Yes, it is.
- Okay, my name is Agent Perez.

656
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:54,611
You can take this up
with your superiors.

657
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:55,837
- Clear the room!
- You guys move out.

658
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:58,073
No gloves?
Get statements from everybody.

659
00:46:58,182 --> 00:46:59,410
- Yes, ma'am.
- And find out who this Two Star is.

660
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:01,450
I mean, come on, really!

661
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:19,733
Sir! We have a positive ID.

662
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:31,774
Okay.

663
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,644
The skin was pretty fried,
but we still managed to get

664
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:39,745
a partial print that matches
to a Ranim Khalid.

665
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:44,385
He's a United States citizen, registered
Republican, and he owns a music store.

666
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:46,928
- The guy's cleaner than Ivory Snow.
- Got something here.

667
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:50,525
- That's a bone mic.
- Hello.

668
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:53,102
Military grade.
He didn't get that on eBay.

669
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,966
Someone was talking to him.

670
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:28,264
We have a cyber-terrorist here.

671
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:30,499
Someone's already inside
our computer systems,

672
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:35,374
hacking into the power grid,
traffic cams, automated cranes.

673
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:38,039
There's no way the boy
and the girl did this alone.

674
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,779
- Agent Zoe Perez?
- Yes.

675
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:14,715
United States Air Force
Security Forces. Please come with us.

676
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:16,843
- What's this about?
- Get in the car.

677
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:21,552
<i>Violence has broken out</i>
<i>in the Middle East as militants accuse</i>

678
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:23,853
<i>the United States</i>
<i>of launching American missiles</i>

679
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:28,159
<i>to demolish a village in Baluchistan,</i>
<i>killing innocent civilians.</i>

680
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:31,666
<i>The attack has triggered a
<i>series of retaliatory suicide bombings</i>

00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:34,032
<i>against American embassies abroad.</i>

682
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:38,267
<i>Early reports indicate the American</i>
<i>death toll now stands at 56,</i>

683
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:41,143
<i>with threats of further violence</i>
<i>here at home.</i>

684
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:42,711
<i>Officials...</i>

685
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:50,477
What's he doing on a train, your kid?

686
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:53,819
He goes to a music magnet.

687
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:57,257
His school's on a tour of Washington.
They're playing at the Kennedy Center.

688
00:49:57,361 --> 00:50:01,092
Wow. That's big. And you just...

689
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:06,595
Well, why'd you make that noise, "Huh"?

690
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:08,227
I can't make noises now?

691
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,701
- You think I should have gone.
- He's playing at the Kennedy Center.

692
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:13,298
- That's kind of a big deal.
- It is a big deal.

693
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:15,640
So I think maybe one parent
should have gone, that's all I'm saying.

694
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:17,338
Well, one parent had to work
while the other one does

695
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:20,280
everything humanly possible
to bail on child support.

696
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:24,151
But I don't expect you to know
a thing about responsibility.

697
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,718
You know, Rachel, you don't know
the first thing about me.

698
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:29,382
I know your brother just died,
and whatever he was into

699
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:31,620
- put my son's life at risk.
- I don't wanna talk about my brother.

700
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:34,219
- Okay? I'm not kidding.
- I'm not kidding, either.

701
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:36,299
Jesus, look what happened.

702
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,929
Can you honestly say he had
nothing to do with this?

703
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,901
I'm asking you not to talk about him!
Respect that.

704
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:43,530
I'm asking you to be honest
with yourself. Your brother's a...

705
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:09,697
Hey! You can't just walk away!
You can't just leave!

706
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:11,791
- Yes, I can.
- Now we have 15 minutes to get

707
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,666
- wherever the hell we're going, all right?
- Yeah.

708
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:25,345
I need you.

709
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,615
I could've gone.

710
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:36,957
I should have.

711
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:08,423
<i>You are two minutes behind schedule.</i>
<i>Go to the alley behind the building.</i>

712
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:15,222
<i>- Go to the armored truck.</i>
- I don't see an armored truck.

713
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:17,765
There it is.

714
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:27,108
<i>In 20 seconds, men will exit</i>
<i>the elevator. They will be armed.</i>

715
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:28,768
<i>One will be carrying a briefcase.</i>

716
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:31,040
<i>Retrieve it from him,</i>
<i>then return to the van.</i>

717
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,979
- This is insane. I'm not doing this.
- You want us to rob them?

718
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:34,550
<i>You now have 15 seconds.</i>

719
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:39,916
<i>Security. What's your emergency?</i>

720
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:48,528
What are you doing?
I'm not robbing them. Shit.

721
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:01,771
Put your gun on the floor.

722
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:03,937
Put your gun on the floor! Look straight.

723
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:05,981
You want me to blow his head off?
Put the gun on the ground!

724
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:07,743
We don't wanna hurt you guys.
Just drop the case.

725
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,148
Drop the case and kick it to her!

726
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:10,981
Yeah, well, you're bringing a shit storm
on your head.

727
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:13,021
Yeah, we're already in mid shit storm!
Now kick the case.

728
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:14,556
Okay! Easy.

729
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:17,959
- Look straight.
- Okay, done.

730
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:20,029
Kick it!

731
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:24,422
Okay.

732
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,126
- Don't even think about it!
- Back up.

733
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:27,362
Easy.

734
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:31,100
Back up.

735
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,005
Walk over here, stand next to him,
and turn around.

736
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:35,600
- Stand over here!
- Just take it easy.

737
00:53:36,913 --> 00:53:40,781
Turn around. Turn around. Turn around!

738
00:53:53,129 --> 00:53:54,721
Let's move, let's move!

739
00:53:58,868 --> 00:53:59,835
Come on!

740
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:16,276
Jerry! Here!

741
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:20,182
Move, move!

742
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:25,191
Freeze! Police!

743
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:27,626
Drop the gun! Drop the gun!

744
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:28,993
We're security! We just got robbed!

745
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,397
And there they are! We just got robbed!

746
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:37,333
Move! Get out of the way!

747
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:38,975
Move!

748
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:46,312
Get out of the way! Out of the way!

749
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:47,383
Move!

750
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:51,577
- Hey, watch it, lady!
- Jerry, run!

751
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:53,055
This way!

752
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,885
- Out of the way!
- Come on!

753
00:54:57,994 --> 00:54:59,518
- Move out of the way!
- Move!

754
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:03,693
You see that? This way.

755
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:18,974
- You are Jerry Shaw?
- Yeah.

756
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:23,485
Please come. Please.

757
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,019
- Thank you.
- Please come in.

758
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:30,048
Hi.

759
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:47,606
- Wait. What is that?
- It's a timer.

760
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:49,907
- For what?
- I don't know.

761
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:52,447
The only things I can think of
with timers are microwaves and...

762
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:54,176
And bombs.
You were gonna say bombs.

763
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:58,415
- Coffeemakers have timers.
- Yeah, Jerry, it's a coffeemaker.

764
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:00,853
That's great.

765
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:25,813
We've mobilized every asset
we can get our hands on.

766
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:27,746
So 12 more confirmed dead?

767
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:29,011
Yes, sir.

768
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:32,811
I want hourly sit reps
from General McKenna.

769
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:35,789
There's a military base
37 miles from that port.

770
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,154
Scramble whatever you can.

771
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,852
- Yes, sir.
- Come with me.

772
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:44,058
Begging your pardon, sir,
but if you're thinking of taking me off

773
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:46,328
- the Shaw investigation, I'd...
- Taking you off?

774
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:49,462
Agent, for the first time
you're being brought onboard.

775
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:59,275
Back to bus 30 minutes. Okay?
30 minutes.

776
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:08,116
We're convinced a terrorist attack
on American soil is imminent.

777
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:12,320
Over the past two days, we've received
over 200 terrorist threats.

778
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:15,193
All starting the day
that Ethan Shaw died.

779
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:21,498
An accident. Or not.
You're gonna help us find out.

780
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:26,368
- Mr. Secretary.
- Gentlemen.

781
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:42,319
- I didn't think that there was a 36th floor.
- Glad we can still keep some secrets.

782
00:57:53,188 --> 00:57:54,678
I want to know what's in the case.
Is it a bomb?

00:58:12,174 --> 00:58:14,608
Well, that was quick. You done playing

Ethan was a Minuteman, just like me.
Army, Navy, Air Force.

869
01:02:49,685 --> 01:02:52,051
Every branch of the military had
a Minuteman posted here

870
01:02:52,154 --> 01:02:57,182
for a 12-hour shift, just in case she
flags a threat, and monitor hardware.

871
01:02:57,292 --> 01:03:02,559
The night Ethan died, he left this post
three minutes early.

<i>Come on, let's blow out the candles.</i>

887
01:03:45,007 --> 01:03:46,770

<i>...Jerry, come on.</i>

890
01:03:53,448 --> 01:03:55,177
- Stop it.
<i>- Do it like Ethan did.</i>

891
01:03:55,284 --> 01:03:59,118
<i>You're different from Ethan</i>
<i>in every way, except one.</i>

We have 14 minutes.

895
01:04:23,912 --> 01:04:25,971
These couriers were hired
by Halloway-Smith

896
01:04:26,081 --> 01:04:28,777
- to transport some sort of case.
- The chemical company?

897
01:04:28,884 --> 01:04:32,012
Yes, exactly. Now, whatever was
in that case, Shaw now has.

898
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,587
They went right for the case.

899
01:04:33,689 --> 01:04:38,319
Give us a minute, will you? We need
to know exactly what was in that case.

900
01:04:38,427 --> 01:04:41,521
They never tell you what's in the case.
I mean, it could Bubonic Plague.

901
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:43,928
- Could be Grandpa's Viagra.
- You know anything?

902
01:04:44,032 --> 01:04:45,431
- What?
- Anything at all?

903
01:04:46,134 --> 01:04:48,227
- What about these guns?
- What about them?

904
01:04:48,337 --> 01:04:49,668
It was a pump-action Remington 870.

905
01:04:49,771 --> 01:04:52,740
Yeah, I know what kind of guns they are.
Get me a gun.

906
01:04:52,841 --> 01:04:54,331
How were they holding them?
Get me a gun!

907
01:04:54,443 --> 01:04:55,842
What the hell do you mean,
how were they holding them?

908
01:04:55,944 --> 01:04:58,572
I mean, in what position
were they holding the gun?

909
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:01,046
- For instance, like this?
- Hey, hey, hey.

910
01:05:01,149 --> 01:05:02,548
- Put that damned thing down!
- Or like in a music video,

911
01:05:02,651 --> 01:05:03,874
- or something like that?
- Hey, hey, hey!

912
01:05:03,985 --> 01:05:04,974
- Put it down!
- They weren't pros!

913
01:05:05,087 --> 01:05:06,213
Okay, that's what I was asking you.

914
01:05:06,321 --> 01:05:07,788
So they didn't know
how to handle a weapon.

915
01:05:07,889 --> 01:05:09,015
- No.
- All right.

916
01:05:09,124 --> 01:05:10,989
Get what you can
out of Batman and Robin here.

917
01:05:11,093 --> 01:05:12,856
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

918
01:05:12,961 --> 01:05:15,725
We just checked cameras.
They said Shaw fired at one...

919
01:05:15,831 --> 01:05:18,629
Don't tell me.
Everything magically went black.

920
01:05:42,858 --> 01:05:45,258
Hi, my name's Thomas Morgan.
I'm with the FBI.

921
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:48,329
<i>- Are your cameras on a network?</i>
<i>- No, man.</i>

922
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:51,194
- VCR's in the back.
- Well, I'm gonna need your tapes.

923
01:05:54,102 --> 01:05:55,126
Shit.

924
01:05:58,106 --> 01:05:59,073
Sam!

925
01:05:59,508 --> 01:06:01,601
- Sam? Sam, where are you?
<i>- Hey, Mom, I got your message.</i>

926
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:03,075
<i>The train's awesome!</i>

927
01:06:03,178 --> 01:06:04,873
- Sam, listen to me.
<i>- Brian tried to burp the alphabet,</i>

928
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:06,811
<i>- but he gagged when he got to "M."</i>
- Listen to me.

929
01:06:06,915 --> 01:06:08,644
<i>Call you when I hit D.C. Bye, Mom.</i>

930
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:11,150
<i>Your son left that message</i>
<i>60 seconds ago.</i>

931
01:06:11,453 --> 01:06:14,786
<i>You will see him again.</i>
<i>But there's something we require first.</i>

932
01:06:16,525 --> 01:06:19,085
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

933
01:06:24,166 --> 01:06:27,260
- No.
<i>- You will do it, or Sam will die.</i>

934
01:06:27,636 --> 01:06:29,934
<i>You have six minutes</i>
<i>to return to the bus.</i>

935
01:06:38,947 --> 01:06:41,347
- Ready?
- Here, you okay?

936
01:06:41,783 --> 01:06:42,750
We should go.

937
01:06:46,822 --> 01:06:50,815
Sir, we got something.
Play this screen right here.

938
01:06:51,793 --> 01:06:54,921
Okay, freeze that. Now zoom in
on the front of the bus right there.

939
01:06:55,030 --> 01:06:56,395
- Put it up on the other monitor.
- Yes, sir.

940
01:06:56,498 --> 01:06:59,467
Now zoom in.
Zoom in on this point right here.

941
01:06:59,568 --> 01:07:01,365
Can we zoom in tighter than that?

942
01:07:03,805 --> 01:07:05,932
Okay, enhance that shot.

943
01:07:07,509 --> 01:07:09,739
That's our guy, that's Jerry Shaw.

944
01:07:10,846 --> 01:07:14,077
Zoom in right here on this spot.
Right there. The reflection.

945
01:07:14,182 --> 01:07:15,740
All right. All right.

946
01:07:15,851 --> 01:07:17,751
Right there. Hello, sweetheart.

947
01:07:17,853 --> 01:07:21,016
Okay, so we got
a white brunette female,

948
01:07:21,122 --> 01:07:23,352
mid to late 20s, approximately 5'9".

949
01:07:23,458 --> 01:07:25,221
Find me that chartered bus!

950
01:07:25,327 --> 01:07:29,024
Masako. M-A-S-A-K-O.
Sightseeing Tours.

951
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:30,097
What time did they get on?

952
01:07:36,338 --> 01:07:39,000
I'm sorry for what I said about Ethan.

953
01:07:47,849 --> 01:07:50,340
It's like he had a rocket
strapped to his back.

954
01:07:50,452 --> 01:07:52,943
And it wasn't his fault.
He was just that way.

955
01:07:53,555 --> 01:07:55,614
And I was not that way.

956
01:07:57,559 --> 01:08:01,586
I was the complete opposite.
I was the brother with lead shoes.

957
01:08:03,832 --> 01:08:05,857
That was my role, I was good at it.

958
01:08:07,802 --> 01:08:10,703
And he'd always try to help me.
You know, "This is how you throw it."

959
01:08:10,805 --> 01:08:14,468
"Do it like this." "Write it like that."
"Put your foot here."

960
01:08:14,576 --> 01:08:18,171
Even with the small things.
Homework, chores, anything like that,

961
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:19,975
he would handle it
and then say that I did it,

962
01:08:20,081 --> 01:08:24,541
just so my father would notice me.
That was Ethan.

963
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:35,393
He never asked me for anything. Ever.

964
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:42,329
And whatever this is, he was part of it.
I feel like he needs my help to finish it.

965
01:08:44,739 --> 01:08:46,172
I owe him that.

966
01:08:53,748 --> 01:08:56,979
<i>We are now approaching</i>
<i>Dayton International Airport.</i>

967
01:08:57,085 --> 01:09:02,284
<i>Please use caution as you exit the bus.</i>
<i>And don't forget any of your belongings.</i>

968
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:03,482
<i>Thank you.</i>

969
01:09:04,993 --> 01:09:08,485
<i>Attention, passengers. Please do not</i>
<i>leave your luggage unattended.</i>

970
01:09:08,863 --> 01:09:11,229
<i>Unattended luggage is subject</i>
<i>to collection and search</i>

971
01:09:11,333 --> 01:09:14,666
<i>by the airport police.</i>
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

972
01:09:17,939 --> 01:09:19,770
Yes, I'm walking toward them now. Yes.

973
01:09:19,874 --> 01:09:23,571
Hey. These are from her.
Go to the ticketing machine.

974
01:09:23,678 --> 01:09:27,239
Use the credit card to get your tickets.
Then walk to Gate 1-C.

975
01:09:28,717 --> 01:09:30,048
They now have them.

976
01:09:35,857 --> 01:09:37,188
That's a nice picture.

977
01:09:43,732 --> 01:09:46,826
Okay. I need you guys at every exit,
watching faces.

978
01:09:46,935 --> 01:09:48,664
Work the secure area first.

979
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:50,169
Go to the tower, have them order

980
01:09:50,271 --> 01:09:52,739
a ground stop.
Don't change the departure boards.

981
01:09:52,841 --> 01:09:54,672
We don't want them to know
we're coming.

982
01:10:03,151 --> 01:10:06,643
Sir, can you please shut the cell phone
off? You cannot take it through.

983
01:10:06,755 --> 01:10:08,780
- FBI. Clear the way.
- FBI. Please step back.

984
01:10:14,262 --> 01:10:15,991
Please, there are others behind you.

985
01:10:16,097 --> 01:10:17,997
- Keep it moving.
- Shoes and hats off, please!

986
01:10:18,099 --> 01:10:21,193
- Shoes also, yes.
- Laptops should be out of their cases!

987
01:10:21,302 --> 01:10:23,634
You need to make sure your jackets
are off and screened separately.

988
01:10:23,738 --> 01:10:27,003
- Sir, step in the circle, please.
- Have boarding passes in hand, please!

989
01:10:27,108 --> 01:10:28,473
We need to move this line quickly.

990
01:10:28,576 --> 01:10:30,908
Sir, that needs to go through.

991
01:10:31,479 --> 01:10:34,209
Ma'am, anything in your pockets?
Move it along.

992
01:10:36,785 --> 01:10:38,719
Hats and shoes off, please!

993
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:41,914
- Laptops should be out of your bags!
- All right, next in line, please.

994
01:10:42,023 --> 01:10:43,490
Have your tickets ready.

995
01:10:47,629 --> 01:10:51,531
- Ma'am? Hat and shoes go in the bin.
- Step through.

996
01:10:56,805 --> 01:10:57,772
Wait.

997
01:10:58,106 --> 01:11:03,305
Shoes and hats off, please!
Laptops should be out of their bags!

998
01:11:15,056 --> 01:11:16,080
Go ahead.

999
01:11:16,191 --> 01:11:17,783
Please move to the back
and let the air crew go first.

1000
01:11:17,892 --> 01:11:21,293
Step through, ma'am.
Boarding pass, please. Thank you.

1001
01:11:21,396 --> 01:11:22,829
Have your tickets ready.

1002
01:11:22,931 --> 01:11:24,592
- Have a safe trip.
- Thank you.

1003
01:11:24,733 --> 01:11:28,260
- All right, let's move forward. Next.
- She changed the screen.

1004
01:11:28,369 --> 01:11:31,395
Lay it down flat inside the bin.

1005
01:11:33,408 --> 01:11:37,276
- Please have boarding pass in hand!
- Right over here, ma'am.

1006
01:11:37,378 --> 01:11:39,903
Laptops should be out of their bags!

1007
01:11:53,895 --> 01:11:56,625
FBI! Out of the way!

1008
01:11:56,765 --> 01:11:58,995
Out of the way, out of the way!
Move, move!

1009
01:11:59,701 --> 01:12:01,191
Move!

1010
01:12:09,344 --> 01:12:11,778
- Everybody, get down!
- Over here!

1011
01:12:13,014 --> 01:12:14,948
- Move, move!
- Oh, my God!

1012
01:12:15,650 --> 01:12:18,016
Stay down! Get out of the way!

1013
01:12:28,229 --> 01:12:29,321
- Sir, sir, sir!
- Yes?

1014
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:31,921
I need your help. I'm sorry. Come here!

1015
01:12:35,603 --> 01:12:36,797
Thank you.

1016
01:12:51,619 --> 01:12:53,610
Hey, you aren't supposed to be in here!

1017
01:13:24,152 --> 01:13:25,710
Go, go, go!

1018
01:14:20,008 --> 01:14:20,975
Move!

1019
01:15:42,390 --> 01:15:44,255
<i>Set the briefcase down.</i>

1020
01:15:53,334 --> 01:15:54,665
<i>Open it.</i>

1021
01:15:56,504 --> 01:15:59,029
<i>Load a vial into each syringe</i>
<i>and inject yourselves.</i>

1022
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:01,768
- What is it?
<i>- An experimental heart drug.</i>

1023
01:16:01,876 --> 01:16:03,810
<i>- The cargo hold is unpressurized.</i>
- Take this.

1024
01:16:03,911 --> 01:16:07,347
<i>The injections will lower your heart rate,</i>
<i>reducing your need for oxygen.</i>

1025
01:16:07,448 --> 01:16:08,437
No.

1026
01:16:09,817 --> 01:16:11,580
- Roll your sleeve up.
- No, I can't do this.

1027
01:16:11,686 --> 01:16:12,744
Roll your...

1028
01:16:12,854 --> 01:16:14,378
No! No, no, no, I can't.

1029
01:16:14,489 --> 01:16:17,185
- We have to. Ready?
<i>- You have a 92% chance of survival.</i>

1030
01:16:17,291 --> 01:16:18,588
- No.
- We have to.

1031
01:16:18,693 --> 01:16:21,161
<i>Do it now, or you will suffocate.</i>

1032
01:16:23,865 --> 01:16:24,832
Okay.

1033
01:16:25,299 --> 01:16:26,823
<i>Get in the crate.</i>

1034
01:16:26,934 --> 01:16:28,094
No. No.

1035
01:16:29,704 --> 01:16:33,663
- No, no. Oh, God.
- Stop it. Stop it.

1036
01:16:38,246 --> 01:16:39,338
Why is that plane on the runway?

1037
01:16:39,447 --> 01:16:42,678
Shit, the military's cleared to
override a terminal lockdown.

1038
01:16:42,784 --> 01:16:44,183
Okay, I want you to work with the FAA.

1039
01:16:44,285 --> 01:16:47,812
I want to know what's in that plane
and where it's going.

1040
01:16:53,628 --> 01:16:55,459
- Oh, my God.
- You'll be all right.

1041
01:16:55,563 --> 01:16:57,531
Just talk to me.
We just gotta talk it through.

1042
01:16:57,632 --> 01:16:59,759
- Okay.
- Just tell me anything.

1043
01:17:01,135 --> 01:17:03,603
Anything you'd never rationally
tell a stranger.

1044
01:17:03,704 --> 01:17:05,001
You're being sweet, but it's not working.

1045
01:17:05,106 --> 01:17:07,233
Just tell me anything. Your ex-husband.

1046
01:17:07,341 --> 01:17:09,741
- You didn't tell me about him.
- Okay, you're gonna distract me by

1047
01:17:09,844 --> 01:17:11,277
bringing up the biggest mistake
of my life?

1048
01:17:11,379 --> 01:17:13,677
It can't be the biggest mistake.
You got your child out of it.

1049
01:17:13,781 --> 01:17:14,805
- You know? You got Sam out of it.
- Yeah, yeah,

1050
01:17:14,916 --> 01:17:17,077
now you're gonna distract me
by bringing up

1051
01:17:17,185 --> 01:17:20,313
- the one thing I'm most afraid of losing.
- Oh, God, you're hard to please.

1052
01:17:21,222 --> 01:17:22,519
I'm sorry.

1053
01:17:24,025 --> 01:17:28,155
Is your son handsome?
Yeah? What's he look like?

1054
01:17:30,498 --> 01:17:32,432
- You got a picture?
- Yeah.

1055
01:17:32,533 --> 01:17:34,125
Well, let me see.

1056
01:17:36,904 --> 01:17:39,099
- There he is.
- The tooth grew in.

1057
01:17:39,207 --> 01:17:41,334
- I hope so.
- It's an old picture.

1058
01:17:42,343 --> 01:17:43,310
See? You're a good influence.

1059
01:17:43,411 --> 01:17:46,642
He plays an instrument.
He's got a happy face. He's got teeth.

1060
01:17:47,782 --> 01:17:50,250
You beat yourself up for no reason.

1061
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:54,418
Let's keep going.
What's the husband's name?

1062
01:17:54,522 --> 01:17:56,353
- Ex.
- Ex-husband. What's his name?

1063
01:17:56,457 --> 01:17:59,051
- Craig.
- Craig sounds like a shithead.

1064
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:00,787
He is a shithead.

1065
01:18:01,596 --> 01:18:04,997
I mean, every year he forgets
his own son's birthday.

1066
01:18:05,466 --> 01:18:08,401
Really? That sucks.

1067
01:18:11,272 --> 01:18:14,070
I mean, after I kicked his ass out,

1068
01:18:15,676 --> 01:18:18,839
I was so scared
I didn't know what I was gonna do.

1069
01:18:23,050 --> 01:18:24,984
And then this one night,

1070
01:18:26,854 --> 01:18:29,823
I went into Sam's room,
he was, like, three months old,

1071
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:35,020
and there he was, just smiling at me.

1072
01:18:36,063 --> 01:18:37,894
And that little face...

1073
01:18:42,670 --> 01:18:45,798
And I was, like, I'm gonna do this.
I can do this.

1074
01:18:47,241 --> 01:18:49,072
Whatever it takes.

1075
01:18:57,652 --> 01:19:01,520
I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna disappoint you.

1076
01:19:06,627 --> 01:19:09,323
Aria, would you please bring up
the video log

1077
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:11,022
of the night Ethan Shaw died?

1078
01:19:11,132 --> 01:19:16,365
<i>Sequencing video log 1137-Z.</i>
<i>Here you are, Major.</i>

1079
01:19:16,470 --> 01:19:18,904
See that?
He's leaving three minutes early,

1080
01:19:19,006 --> 01:19:21,907
and he's not even waiting
for logout confirmation.

1081
01:19:22,243 --> 01:19:24,609
- Can you play that again?
- Sure.

1082
01:19:28,382 --> 01:19:29,940
Did you see that?

1083
01:19:30,051 --> 01:19:31,848
With his cell phone.

1084
01:19:36,891 --> 01:19:39,052
Look, he's doing that on purpose.
Is that Morse code?

1085
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:40,957
- Yeah.
- Here.

1086
01:19:49,770 --> 01:19:52,398
Why is he walking in circles
around the elevator?

1087
01:19:52,506 --> 01:19:54,906
<i>- Initiating video shutdown for analysis.</i>
- No.

1088
01:19:55,042 --> 01:19:57,738
No, Aria, wait.
Listen, I'm prioritizing this feed.

1089
01:19:57,845 --> 01:19:59,870
- Stay with this.
<i>- Apologies, Major Bowman.</i>

1090

<i>Critical data sectors</i>
<i>have been corrupted.</i>

1091
01:20:01,616 --> 01:20:03,550
Aria, this is important!
Stay with this feed!

1092
01:20:03,651 --> 01:20:05,016
<i>Video sequence erased.</i>

1093
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:07,485
Aria, go to the backups!
Do not erase this!

1094
01:20:07,588 --> 01:20:09,351
- It's a priority. You hear me?
- Bowman.

1095
01:20:09,457 --> 01:20:12,324
- Loop it. Whatever you have to do.
- Bowman.

1096
01:20:20,134 --> 01:20:22,534
It's the only place she can't see.

1097
01:20:23,871 --> 01:20:25,236
This way.

1098
01:20:41,322 --> 01:20:43,051
It's a memory card

1099
01:20:43,924 --> 01:20:46,222
<i>from Ethan's cell phone.</i>

1100

<i>Do you understand?</i>

1102
01:21:12,753 --> 01:21:13,947
Let's go.

1103
01:21:36,177 --> 01:21:38,668
We got clearance to land
at the Pentagon.

1104
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:40,069
Go ahead.

1105
01:21:40,181 --> 01:21:43,582
I'm at the Pentagon.
Ethan Shaw wasn't an adversary.

1106
01:21:43,684 --> 01:21:47,643
He wasn't even a Public Affairs officer.
He worked here, 36 floors underground.

1107
01:21:47,755 --> 01:21:49,518
He was working for
the Secretary of Defense.

1108
01:21:49,623 --> 01:21:51,181
<i>- The Secretary of Defense?</i>
- Yes.

1109
01:21:51,292 --> 01:21:53,055
<i>On a project called Eagle Eye.</i>

1110
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:55,594
I just listened to a
message he left before he died.

1111
01:21:55,696 --> 01:21:56,720
It's big.

Sir. Come with me.

1115
01:22:36,337 --> 01:22:38,168
I have 10 minutes before
I'm sequestered

1116

1119
01:22:43,110 --> 01:22:44,099

- the chatter, all of it...
- Hold it.

1123
01:23:22,783 --> 01:23:25,616
Ethan Shaw left three minutes early
to leave us a recording.

1124
01:23:25,719 --> 01:23:26,981
To warn us.

Sir,

1151
01:24:35,656 --> 01:24:38,784
what abort recommendation
is Aria talking about?

1152
01:24:41,729 --> 01:24:44,459
Three days ago, we thought we had
Majid al-Khoei and a training camp

1153
01:24:44,565 --> 01:24:47,534
full of operatives.
But the intel was false.

1154
01:24:48,135 --> 01:24:49,966
Aria tried to stop us.

1155
01:24:50,604 --> 01:24:52,367
We got the wrong guy?

1156
01:25:22,069 --> 01:25:23,559
I'm gonna need a full lockdown
on this level.

1157
01:25:23,671 --> 01:25:26,765
No one gets in or out without
going through me first. You got it?

1158
01:25:26,874 --> 01:25:28,569
- Thank you.
- Sir, this is the only item

1159
01:25:28,676 --> 01:25:30,974
offloaded from the Dayton C-17.

1160
01:25:31,078 --> 01:25:32,602
Let me see that.

1161
01:25:33,614 --> 01:25:35,343
I need access to your 36th floor.

1162
01:25:35,449 --> 01:25:37,212
- We don't have a 36th floor.
- Yes, you do.

1163
01:25:37,318 --> 01:25:38,842
Get your commander
and tell him to meet us down there.

1164
01:25:38,953 --> 01:25:39,920
Come on, let's go.

What's Operation Guillotine?

1173
01:26:53,827 --> 01:26:56,455
It's a simulation we run.
A terrorism drill.

How to keep the government going

1175

in case the line of succession
were terminated.

1176
01:27:01,168 --> 01:27:03,500
And Shaw put a biometric lock on her,
to stop her.

1177
01:27:03,604 --> 01:27:06,539
Right. And he's dead.

1178
01:27:07,875 --> 01:27:11,140
- So without Ethan Shaw, she's frozen.
- Right.

1179
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:14,247
Wrong.

1180
01:27:14,848 --> 01:27:16,816

If this is right, we can't afford the risk.

1189
01:27:56,390 --> 01:27:57,482
Do it.

1190
01:28:09,503 --> 01:28:12,063
This is Secretary Callister.
There's been a malfunction in the vault.

1191
01:28:12,172 --> 01:28:13,537
Open the door.

Come with me. Don't ask any questions.

1246

Please.

1247
01:32:13,447 --> 01:32:15,642
- You got to let me talk to him.
- The kid had a gun.

1248
01:32:15,749 --> 01:32:17,649
The military has the ball now.

1249
01:32:17,751 --> 01:32:19,184
- Sir!
- I'll get the Attorney General involved.

1250
01:32:19,286 --> 01:32:22,084
Believe me, I will. 'Cause if it's not
you, I'm talking to somebody.

1251
01:32:22,189 --> 01:32:23,656
You don't understand
the possibilities here.

1252
01:32:23,757 --> 01:32:25,486
- What do you want?
- You need to listen. This is important.

1253
01:32:25,592 --> 01:32:28,561
Sixteen hours ago, a commercial
explosive went missing from

1254
01:32:28,662 --> 01:32:32,098
a testing site in Aberdeen.
The explosive is called Hex.

1255
01:32:32,199 --> 01:32:34,690
It's a crystal that detonates
on a sonic trigger.

1256
01:32:34,801 --> 01:32:36,063
- A crystal.
- Yes.

1257
01:32:36,570 --> 01:32:38,401
We're only talking about a small
amount that's missing...

1258
01:32:38,505 --> 01:32:39,995
Give me a ratio.

1259
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:42,772
One crystal to a football field.

1260
01:32:45,245 --> 01:32:48,737
You couldn't have picked a worse time
to be of some goddamn use.

1261
01:32:56,089 --> 01:32:58,614
Please, just tell me where we're going.

1262
01:33:01,294 --> 01:33:04,593
I tracked the shipping on the trigger.
It was sent to the guy that we found

1263
01:33:04,698 --> 01:33:07,223
underneath the wires. Ranim Khalid.

1264
01:33:08,702 --> 01:33:11,102
- The music shop guy.
- Yes, exactly.

1265
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:14,502
I'm not gonna let us go down in history

1266
01:33:14,608 --> 01:33:16,439
as the assholes who let
this thing happen.

1267
01:33:16,543 --> 01:33:19,307
Open the door!
You don't know what's about to happen!

1268
01:33:21,448 --> 01:33:23,245
Tom Morgan. The Attorney General

1269
01:33:23,350 --> 01:33:24,874
has authorized me to take him
in for questioning.

1270
01:33:24,985 --> 01:33:27,749
We're at threat level orange.
You guys gotta help me.

1271
01:33:27,854 --> 01:33:29,685
All right. Let him out.

1272
01:33:32,159 --> 01:33:33,820
Listen to me. Remember the voice
I was talking about?

1273
01:33:33,927 --> 01:33:36,395
Yeah, yeah, shut up! Thanks, guys.

1274
01:33:37,597 --> 01:33:41,931
I can get fired for this nine ways,
so button it or I'll turn us both in.

1275
01:33:58,218 --> 01:33:59,446
Follow me.

1276
01:34:03,924 --> 01:34:06,916
Hey, guys, here's one more for the
6:30 p.m. Capitol Limited.

1277
01:34:07,027 --> 01:34:08,585
All right, man.

1278
01:34:14,201 --> 01:34:16,328
Well, it's awfully cold outside.

1279
01:34:18,738 --> 01:34:20,706
Here's mine. Come on, let's go.

1280
01:34:20,807 --> 01:34:22,707
- Mr. Miller!
- Yes.

1281
01:34:22,809 --> 01:34:25,539
- Hello, I'm Chris Carrick.
- Tom Donaldson.

1282
01:34:26,012 --> 01:34:27,980
We're from the White House.

1283
01:34:28,081 --> 01:34:29,708
- Something wrong?
- Not exactly.

1284
01:34:29,816 --> 01:34:32,046
There's been a change of plans.

1285
01:34:32,185 --> 01:34:33,618
How so?

1286
01:34:39,493 --> 01:34:42,155
This is for you.
She wants you to change.

1287
01:34:43,196 --> 01:34:46,632
Is that your family? Your parents?

1288
01:34:47,901 --> 01:34:51,132
David, I bet you love them
as much as I love my son.

1289
01:34:52,405 --> 01:34:53,804
His name's Sam.

1290
01:34:55,075 --> 01:34:58,169
He's on a train.
Do you know anything about that?

1291
01:35:05,318 --> 01:35:07,479
Maybe we can help each other.

1292
01:35:10,157 --> 01:35:11,419
Please.

1293
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:16,188
When you're done, she wants you
to use the Capitol subway system.

1294
01:35:16,296 --> 01:35:17,888
It's on the ground floor. I'm sorry.

1295
01:35:17,998 --> 01:35:19,488
- David. Please.
- No. Sorry.

1296
01:35:19,599 --> 01:35:21,499
You have three minutes.

1297
01:35:25,305 --> 01:35:26,431
Okay, I want to know everything.

1298
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:28,906
The girl, the computer downstairs,
the Hex, everything.

1299
01:35:29,009 --> 01:35:30,374
- What's Hex?
- The crystal explosive.

1300
01:35:30,477 --> 01:35:31,739
- I don't know what that is.
- Don't bullshit me!

1301
01:35:31,845 --> 01:35:33,369
- I don't know what that is!
- Start talking! I wanna know!

1302
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:35,345
I swear I don't know what you're
talking about! Listen to me!

1303
01:35:35,448 --> 01:35:36,540
The computer's tracking us right now!

1304
01:35:36,650 --> 01:35:37,639
Take this stuff
and throw it out the window!

1305
01:35:37,751 --> 01:35:39,651
- What are you talking about?
- You need to take your cell phone,

1306
01:35:40,220 --> 01:35:43,621
your pager, your walkie, anything that
gets a signal, throw it out the window.

1307
01:35:59,873 --> 01:36:02,637
It's gone off! Get down!
Power it down!

1308
01:36:04,277 --> 01:36:06,108
- What the hell's going on?
- System control's locked out.

1309
01:36:08,648 --> 01:36:10,582
I need a vector and a fighter now.

1310
01:36:11,084 --> 01:36:13,450
Viper One, we have a positive ID
on an MQ9 Reaper.

1311
01:36:13,553 --> 01:36:15,851
<i>Snap vector 230 to 132.</i>

1312
01:36:15,956 --> 01:36:17,355
<i>You are authorized to go weapons hot.</i>

1313
01:36:17,457 --> 01:36:20,085
<i>Roger, Northcom.</i>
<i>I have a visual on the Reaper.</i>

1314
01:36:25,832 --> 01:36:27,925
<i>One to Base, One to Base!</i>
<i>Ejection has been initiated.</i>

1315
01:36:28,034 --> 01:36:30,229
<i>I don't have control! I don't have...</i>

1316
01:36:31,738 --> 01:36:33,262
There's a target list.
President, Vice President.

1317
01:36:33,373 --> 01:36:35,034
- There's like twelve people on the list.
- Jesus.

1318
01:36:35,141 --> 01:36:36,631
The State of the Union's in 20 minutes.

1319
01:36:36,743 --> 01:36:38,176
The screen said
"wireless detonator activated."

1320
01:36:38,278 --> 01:36:39,575
- What about the girl?
- She kept the girl alive

1321
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:40,839
- for a reason, I don't know.
- The explosive

1322
01:36:40,947 --> 01:36:42,346
is detonated by sonic trigger.

1323
01:36:42,449 --> 01:36:43,848
It was sent to the guy who got fried.

1324
01:36:43,950 --> 01:36:45,008
He owns an instrument store.

1325
01:36:45,118 --> 01:36:46,585
Does any of that stuff
make any sense to you?

1326
01:36:46,686 --> 01:36:48,847
Rachel's kid plays the trumpet.

1327
01:37:04,471 --> 01:37:06,234
Come on, we gotta go.

1328
01:37:08,041 --> 01:37:09,133
Get out of the car!

1329
01:37:09,242 --> 01:37:10,709
Get out of the car!

1330
01:37:11,144 --> 01:37:12,338
FBI!

1331
01:37:20,587 --> 01:37:22,521
Over there, that tunnel.

1332
01:37:34,301 --> 01:37:35,268
Shit!

1333
01:38:09,302 --> 01:38:12,203
Here. You're gonna need this.

1334
01:38:20,046 --> 01:38:21,308
Okay, listen to me.

1335
01:38:21,414 --> 01:38:23,746
The Library of Congress,
there's a tunnel there.

1336
01:38:23,850 --> 01:38:27,616
It'll get you to the Capitol.
Find the Sergeant at Arms.

1337
01:38:28,021 --> 01:38:29,579
Tell him you have a POTUS 111.

1338
01:38:29,689 --> 01:38:30,986
- What?
- POTUS 111.

1339
01:38:31,091 --> 01:38:34,424
- It's a threat to the President.
- I understand. POTUS 111.

1340
01:38:39,199 --> 01:38:42,168
Now get out of here.
That thing's coming back.

1341
01:38:45,004 --> 01:38:47,097
Go! Go!

1342
01:40:04,818 --> 01:40:06,581
Okay, watch your step.

1343
01:40:06,686 --> 01:40:09,280
Come on down. Here we go.
Come on out. Come on.

1344
01:40:09,389 --> 01:40:11,482
- It's so cool!
- Come on, hurry!

1345
01:40:11,591 --> 01:40:13,582
Guys, it's so cool! Come on, let's go.

1346
01:40:25,338 --> 01:40:28,273
- Library of Congress!
- Hey, get outta here!

1347
01:40:39,853 --> 01:40:41,377
Miss Crowley?

1348
01:40:41,955 --> 01:40:44,048
Miss Crowley. Welcome to the Capitol.

1349
01:40:44,591 --> 01:40:46,388
Senator McDonnell's office said
that you'd be running late.

1350
01:40:46,493 --> 01:40:49,155
- I'll take you to your seat.
- Thank you.

1351
01:40:51,965 --> 01:40:54,798
Aria, why am I being spared?

1352
01:40:54,901 --> 01:40:57,369
<i>Our abort recommendation was ignored,</i>

1353
01:40:57,470 --> 01:41:00,303
<i>triggering violent retaliations against</i>
<i>American citizens</i>

1354
01:41:00,406 --> 01:41:04,240
<i>with no predictable end.</i>
<i>Regime change is the only solution.</i>

1355
01:41:04,878 --> 01:41:06,311
<i>You will lead</i>
<i>the new command structure</i>

1356
01:41:06,412 --> 01:41:08,744
<i>as President of the United States.</i>

1357
01:41:13,186 --> 01:41:15,620
- Help me. Pull these out.
- What are these?

1358
01:41:15,722 --> 01:41:17,349
Her memory blocks.

1359
01:41:17,457 --> 01:41:19,823
This will slow her down,
but her central operating system

1360
01:41:19,926 --> 01:41:21,018
is up on the gantry.

1361
01:41:21,127 --> 01:41:24,324
<i>Warning. Please replace</i>
<i>memory blocks A through F.</i>

1362
01:41:24,430 --> 01:41:27,331
It's like her brain.
Protected by liquid nitrogen.

1363
01:41:27,433 --> 01:41:29,492
We drain it and she'll fry.

1364
01:41:35,308 --> 01:41:36,639
Hey, you can't go in!

1365
01:41:36,743 --> 01:41:38,210
Tom Morgan, FBI. JTTF.

1366
01:41:38,311 --> 01:41:40,370
I have a possible POTUS 111.
Let me in the building.

1367
01:41:41,714 --> 01:41:43,511
Okay, everybody! Everybody!

1368
01:41:44,083 --> 01:41:45,846
Can I have your attention, please?

1369
01:41:45,952 --> 01:41:49,388
Saxophones, remember shorter
on those quarter notes.

1370
01:41:49,756 --> 01:41:52,418
And when we get to the crescendo,

1371
01:41:52,525 --> 01:41:56,256
"land of the free," hold that high F.

1372
01:41:56,362 --> 01:41:57,795
And smile.

1373
01:41:57,897 --> 01:42:01,526
Okay? It's not every day
you get to play for the President!

1374
01:42:20,286 --> 01:42:23,619
Here we are.
And anything else, Miss Crowley?

1375
01:42:23,723 --> 01:42:25,054
No, thanks.

1376
01:42:45,011 --> 01:42:48,310
Madam Speaker,
the President's Cabinet!

1377
01:43:01,561 --> 01:43:03,085
POTUS 111!
There's a bomb in the building!

1378
01:43:03,196 --> 01:43:05,061
Stop! No entry! No exceptions!

1379
01:43:05,164 --> 01:43:08,292
Tom Morgan, FBI. Back up.
Give me your cuffs.

1380
01:43:08,401 --> 01:43:09,800
- Give me your cuffs!
- Take it easy!

1381
01:43:09,902 --> 01:43:11,301
- Give me your cuffs.
- I'm reaching for them.

1382
01:43:11,404 --> 01:43:13,201
I'm reaching for them.

1383
01:43:27,587 --> 01:43:29,054
Madam Speaker,

1384
01:43:32,859 --> 01:43:35,487
the President of the United States!

1385
01:43:46,472 --> 01:43:47,871
<i>Data corruption at critical risk.</i>

1386
01:43:51,010 --> 01:43:54,241
<i>You are now in violation of</i>
<i>national security protocol.</i>

1387
01:43:59,519 --> 01:44:02,511
<i>Seeking available options.</i>

1388
01:44:03,990 --> 01:44:07,790
<i>Uploading to offsite satellite.</i>

1389
01:44:08,194 --> 01:44:10,788
<i>- Data upload: 3%.</i>
- Bowman?

1390
01:44:11,064 --> 01:44:13,055
- What is she doing?
- She's trying to back up her memory

1391
01:44:13,166 --> 01:44:15,293
and send it somewhere else!

1392
01:44:16,636 --> 01:44:18,570
<i>- 5%.</i>
- Bowman!

1393
01:44:20,173 --> 01:44:21,367
Bowman!

1394
01:44:27,380 --> 01:44:28,847
<i>8%.</i>

1395
01:44:33,386 --> 01:44:35,946
<i>Over the past three days, 19 Americans</i>

1396
01:44:36,956 --> 01:44:39,618
<i>have lost their lives to brutal</i>
<i>acts of terror...</i>

1397
01:44:39,726 --> 01:44:41,591
- Tunnel secure.
<i>...and hate.</i>

1398
01:44:42,595 --> 01:44:47,191
But I say to you tonight
that our hearts may be broken,

1399
01:44:47,700 --> 01:44:50,430
but our spirit will never be broken!

1400
01:44:56,743 --> 01:44:59,007
<i>Data upload, 17%.</i>

1401
01:45:00,947 --> 01:45:02,539
<i>19%.</i>

1402
01:45:04,484 --> 01:45:08,750
<i>Perez, Zoe, you are now classified</i>
<i>as an enemy of the state.</i>

1403
01:45:10,289 --> 01:45:11,813
<i>23%.</i>

1404
01:45:12,125 --> 01:45:13,558
<i>25%.</i>

1405
01:45:25,538 --> 01:45:29,065
<i>27%. Operation Guillotine is in effect.</i>

1406
01:45:30,376 --> 01:45:32,571
<i>It was nearly 200 years ago,</i>

1407
01:45:32,678 --> 01:45:35,579
<i>in the War of 1812,</i>
<i>that Francis Scott Key</i>

1408
01:45:35,681 --> 01:45:40,380
found himself stuck on a truce ship
during the shelling of Fort McHenry.

1409
01:45:40,486 --> 01:45:42,920
We lost some lives then, too.

1410
01:45:44,090 --> 01:45:47,924
But our flag still flew high and proud.

1411
01:45:48,027 --> 01:45:51,394
And his admiration became our anthem.

1412
01:45:51,664 --> 01:45:53,427
With us tonight is the Youth Orchestra

1413
01:45:53,533 --> 01:45:56,798
of the Barrow School
from Hyde Park, Illinois.

1414
01:45:57,036 --> 01:45:58,196
Sam.

1415
01:45:58,805 --> 01:46:00,773
Let us stand together,

1416
01:46:01,274 --> 01:46:05,210
as they raise our spirits every inch
as high as that flag

1417
01:46:05,778 --> 01:46:10,010
to show that our union
is still as strong as ever.

1418
01:46:28,467 --> 01:46:31,925
<i>Oh, say can you see</i>

1419
01:46:32,038 --> 01:46:36,338
<i>by the dawn's early light</i>

1420
01:46:36,442 --> 01:46:40,902
<i>What so proudly we hailed</i>

1421
01:46:41,013 --> 01:46:45,279
<i>at the twilight's last gleaming?</i>

1422
01:46:45,718 --> 01:46:49,950
<i>Whose broad stripes and bright stars...</i>

1423
01:46:51,924 --> 01:46:53,858
Sergeant at Arms?

1424
01:46:56,662 --> 01:46:58,186
Hey. Hey.

1425
01:47:47,380 --> 01:47:49,177
Get out, get out.

1426
01:47:50,082 --> 01:47:51,049
Mom!

1427
01:48:16,008 --> 01:48:19,842
Jerry, all right, you did it!
Come on. Yeah, Jerry!

1428
01:48:19,946 --> 01:48:22,813
<i>There are still no named suspects</i>
<i>in the attack on the Blair Tunnel</i>

1429
01:48:22,915 --> 01:48:24,815
<i>and the attacks in the Capitol Building.</i>

1430
01:48:24,917 --> 01:48:27,818
<i>And there is still no word on the</i>
<i>involvement of Jerry Damon Shaw.</i>

1431
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:31,219
<i>... huge assassination attempt,</i>
<i>transportation networks disrupted,</i>

1432
01:48:31,324 --> 01:48:33,952
<i>no suspects identified</i>
<i>or even arrested...</i>

1433
01:48:34,060 --> 01:48:36,551
<i>... any idea who is responsible</i>
<i>for what may be</i>

1434
01:48:36,662 --> 01:48:38,527
<i>the largest-scale</i>
<i>cyber-terror attack that's</i>

1435
01:48:38,631 --> 01:48:40,223
<i>ever been mounted in the United States.</i>

1436
01:48:40,366 --> 01:48:42,266
<i>The House and Senate</i>
<i>Intelligence Committees</i>

1437
01:48:42,368 --> 01:48:43,528
<i>meet in closed-door session</i>

1438
01:48:43,636 --> 01:48:45,695
<i>to discuss ways to prevent this kind of</i>

1439
01:48:45,805 --> 01:48:48,069
<i>internal security breach</i>
<i>that left nearly...</i>

1440
01:48:48,174 --> 01:48:50,574
The Aria project has been
decommissioned

1441
01:48:50,676 --> 01:48:54,134
and all those involved
rotated to other assignments.

1442
01:48:55,014 --> 01:48:57,847
Mr. Secretary,
we can't just stop intelligence-gathering

1443
01:48:57,950 --> 01:49:00,418
just because of what happened here.

1444
01:49:02,388 --> 01:49:04,151
No, we can't.

1445
01:49:04,256 --> 01:49:07,089
All I know is we made
a great many mistakes.

1446
01:49:07,827 --> 01:49:10,990
And good people
paid the ultimate price for them.

1447
01:49:11,630 --> 01:49:14,258
<i>And that's a debt we can't ever repay.</i>

1448
01:49:15,334 --> 01:49:17,427
<i>But we can honor it.</i>

1449
01:49:19,905 --> 01:49:22,840
<i>And we can let their sacrifice remind us</i>

1450
01:49:23,943 --> 01:49:25,877
<i>that sometimes</i>

1451
01:49:25,978 --> 01:49:29,675
<i>the very measures we put into place</i>
<i>to safeguard our liberty</i>

1452
01:49:30,649 --> 01:49:33,516
<i>become threats to liberty itself.</i>

1453
01:49:58,110 --> 01:49:59,600
- Hey, little guy.
- Jerry!

1454
01:49:59,712 --> 01:50:01,737
Look at you, looking older.
How are you?

1455
01:50:01,847 --> 01:50:03,212
- Good.
- Happy birthday.

1456
01:50:03,315 --> 01:50:04,782
It's Rock Band! Is that for me?

1457
01:50:04,884 --> 01:50:07,318
No, this is so your
mom can practice her drumming.

1458
01:50:07,420 --> 01:50:08,887
It is for you. Happy birthday.

1459
01:50:08,988 --> 01:50:10,922
- Wow!
- Sam, what do you say?

1460
01:50:11,023 --> 01:50:12,513
- Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.

1461
01:50:12,625 --> 01:50:14,456
Guys, look, it's Rock Band!

1462
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:16,528
- Cool, let's go.
- Awesome!

1463
01:50:23,636 --> 01:50:25,501
- Sorry, I was late. I was...
- Thank you

1464
01:50:25,604 --> 01:50:27,094
for remembering.

1465
01:50:28,474 --> 01:50:29,441
Yeah.

1466
01:50:39,385 --> 01:50:41,148
I'm glad you're here.

1467
01:50:41,954 --> 01:50:43,182
Me, too.

1468
01:53:43,183 --> 01:53:44,184
