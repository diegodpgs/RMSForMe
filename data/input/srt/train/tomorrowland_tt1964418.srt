1
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,424
Are they on?

2
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,002
Yep. So, introduce yourself.

3
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:02,163
Okay. Hey, I'm Frank. How you doing?

4
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:04,672
Don't answer that. That's rhetorical.

5
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:09,169
Okay. Let's get you up to speed.

6
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:14,051
This is a story about the future.

7
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:15,948
And the future

8
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,014
<i>can be scary.</i>

9
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,253
<i>What?</i>

10
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,589
<i>Are you sure
you wanna go with "scary"?</i>

11
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,128
<i>Yes, I wanna go with scary.</i>

12
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,959
- Okay.
- Okay.

13
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:32,260
<i>The future can be scary.</i>

14
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:36,400
<i>Unstable governments,
overpopulation,</i>

15
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,743
<i>wars on every comment,</i>

16
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:43,143
<i>famine, water shortages,
environmental collapse...</i>

17
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:46,410
<i>And scientific breakthroughs,
wonder and beauty...</i>

18
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,546
Could you please just stop interrupting?

19
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,555
I will. Just try to be
a little more upbeat.

20
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,988
- "Upbeat"?
- Yeah, tell them what you like...

21
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,559
I can't tell them anything
if you keep interrupting me.

22
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:55,821
You're right. Sorry.

23
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,327
As I was saying...

24
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:02,297
<i>With every second
that ticks by, we get closer and closer...</i>

25
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:03,993
<i>I know. Tell them about when...</i>

26
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:06,435
<i>I can't tell them anything
until I tell them about this.</i>

27
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,803
<i>Then, can we please
just start somewhere else?</i>

28
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,239
Fine. Where would you like me to start?

29
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:14,507
Well, you keep saying the future
wasn't always this way, right?

30
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,672
It wasn't.
When I was a kid, the future was...

31
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,681
- Different, right?
- Yeah.

32
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,016
Okay, cool. Then, start there.

33
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:27,952
All right. Well, when I was a kid,
the future was different.

34
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,623
Flushing Meadows Corona Park,
World's Fair.

35
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:38,932
Don't forget your valuables
and enjoy the future.

36
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,034
Watch your step, kiddo.

37
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:28,079
- Hello, sir.
- May I help you?

38
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:31,884
My name is John Francis Walker.
I'm here to win the $50.

39
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,013
Is that so?

40
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,553
I took it apart because of
the nitrogen compartment.

41
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,256
Seeing as how the bus ride
was kind of bumpy

42
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,195
and you know nitro.

43
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,263
I could've used
a hydrogen peroxide-powered engine.

44
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,565
Bell Labs tested that
with their Rocket Belt

45
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:48,867
and I guess there were some issues

46
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:52,103
with maneuverability,
flight duration, and stuff.

47
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,403
It's a jet pack.

48
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,003
Obviously.

49
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:58,509
You made this yourself?

50
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,347
Athena, what are you doing here?

51
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,188
Did you or didn't you?

52
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,961
- What?
- Did you make this yourself?

53
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,093
Yeah.

54
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:19,627
Why?

55
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:25,601
I guess I got tired of waiting around
for someone else to do it for me.

56
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,575
Does it work?

57
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,084
Sure. Yeah.

58
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:42,384
Mostly.

59
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,790
Just doesn't really,
you know, technically...

60
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,139
...ﬂy.

61
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,681
<i>But if it did, "You know,</i>

62
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:12,256
"technically fly,"
what would its purpose be?

63
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,451
How would your jet pack
make the world a better place?

64
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:16,187
Can't it just be fun?

65
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:19,492
Mr. Walker, please tell me
you can do better than "fun."

66
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:21,855
Anything's possible.

67
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,262
I don't know what that means.

68
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,645
If I was walking down the street,

69
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,468
and I saw some kid with
a jet pack ﬂy over me,

70
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,371
I'd believe anything's possible.

71
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,806
I'd be inspired.

72
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:34,468
Doesn't that make
the world a better place?

73
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,138
Well, I suppose it would.

74
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,113
If it worked.

75
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:43,982
Unfortunately, it does not.

76
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,682
And if it doesn't work,
it has no purpose at all.

77
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:50,785
- Thank you for your time, Mr. Walker.
- But I can make it work!

78
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,156
That's the spirit.

79
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,861
Until then, young man, have fun.

80
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,846
Absolutely not.

81
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:15,247
- I like him.
- Athena, no.

82
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:31,902
What makes you
think you're gonna make this thing fly?

83
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,266
I'm optimistic.

84
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,101
- You're wasting your time.
- I'm not!

85
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,835
- Damn contraption.
- It's not a contraption!

86
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,174
- It doesn't work.
- I can make it work.

87
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,610
No, you can't!

88
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,513
I'm not giving up.

89
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,410
Don't turn around. Be cool.

90
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,121
What did I just tell you?

91
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,192
- Sorry.
- Stop talking.

92
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,692
Look over there. Five o'clock.

93
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,892
You know, on a clock?

94
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:02,867
Where the five is.

95
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:08,034
That way.

96
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:11,567
I'm going with them.

97
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:15,304
You count to 20, then follow us.
Don't get spotted.

98
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,814
Who are you?

99
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,584
I'm the future, Frank Walker.

100
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,113
Nice. Do you like it?

101
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:57,783
<i>Travel the globe
in Walt Disney's "it's a small world."</i>

102

<i>A salute to UNICEF
and children everywhere.</i>

103
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,250
Excuse me.

Sorry. Excuse me.

106
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,863
Sorry, folks, you're gonna have
to wait for the next boat.

107
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,596
There'll be another boat
in just a minute.

108
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:18,698
Hello?

109
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,896
Hello?

110
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,706
Hello?

<i>Good afternoon.
Please step aboard the transport.</i>

<i>The site is active.</i>

<i>Please put on your head protection

Wait!

117
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,281
Wait!

No, phases one and two took a...

Hey! That's mine!

125
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,369
Did you just fix it?

126
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,205
Hey!

127
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,649
Hey! There he is.

Hey!

00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,060
Hey!

130
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,086
It works now.

131
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,207
So, what is this place?

132
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,719
<i>And then everything went to hell.</i>

133
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,947
<i>- Oh, boy.
- Well, it did.</i>

134
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,966
<i>So you gave them, iike, one second
of blue skies and jet packs and hope...</i>

135
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,256
<i>It's important.
They need to know the stakes.</i>

136
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:55,128
<i>I think they can figure out
clocks counting down are bad.</i>

137
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:56,564
- Do you wanna tell the story?
- No, you're doing fine.

138
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,124
Because if you think
you can tell the story better,

139
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:00,431
I would absolutely love to hear you try.

140
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:02,404
- Really?
- Really.

141
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,772
I guess, technically,
I am more qualified.

142
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:07,735
Are you? How so?

143
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:11,474
Because, unlike you, I'm an optimist.

144
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,082
- Babe, you filming?
- It's video.

145
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,450
- I knew it!
- Are you videoing?

146
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:17,988
Okay. Go ahead, sweetie.

147
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,488
Do your thing, Casey.

148
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,488
That's Sirius.

149
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,583
That's Canopus.

150
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,492
That's Arcturus.

151
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:27,155
Rigil Kentaurus.

152
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:32,430
Vega, Procyon, Capella, Betelgeuse.

153
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:35,095
And why do you love
the stars so much, Casey?

154
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:39,834
Because I wanna go there.

155
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,605
But it's so far away.

156
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,840
It'll take a long time. A real long time.

157
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:47,213
What if you get all the way up there,
and there's nothing?

158
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:52,622
What if there's everything?

159
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,055
<i>- Oh, boy.
- What?</i>

160
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,716
<i>Are you gonna go through
your entire childhood?</i>

161
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:58,125
<i>You started when you were a kid.
I'm just giving them context.</i>

162
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,027
<i>Just move it along. Okay?
They don't have all day.</i>

163
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,154
<i>Cool. You got it.</i>

164
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,837
Identify yourself!

165
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:06,178
Nate!

166
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,646
If you wake up Dad, I will crush you.

167
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,987
You shouldn't sneak out.

168
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:13,489
Well, you shouldn't still need a wubby.

169
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,884
Dad says it's okay to sleep with.

170
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,257
That's because
he doesn't want you to grow up.

171
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,858
Were you at the platform again?

172
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:23,931
What do you do out there?

173
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:27,099
Are you trying to stop them
from taking it down?

174
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:31,373
That would make me a criminal.

175
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,671
And a pretty terrible role model

176
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,838
to impressionable youth
such as yourself.

177
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,616
But if someone else did it,

178
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:44,583
I'd have to assume they believed

179
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:50,389
even the teeniest of actions
could change the future.

180
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:53,425
How can you be sure?

181
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,199
Because I know how things work.

182
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:00,030
Why are they taking the platform down?

183
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:05,733
Because it's hard to have ideas
and easy to give up.

184
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,773
But you won't. Right?

185
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:14,709
Never.

186
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:59,685
Hey, Dad. Heading to school.

187
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,588
- I made you lunch.
- Hey!

188
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,098
Wrap it up.

189
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,335
- How did you do...
- You would have gotten it.

190
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:20,276
Yeah, Eddie Newton.

191
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,383
What?

192
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,549
All three cranes?

193
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:28,522
All right, Douglas.
Thanks for the call. Bye.

194
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:29,684
Everything okay?

195
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:31,853
Yeah, the equipment over
at Canaveral is down again.

196
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,123
- Weird.
- Really weird.

197
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,024
Well, at least you get the day off.

198
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,330
Actually, they're bringing in
replacement cranes from Orlando,

199
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,633
so I will be back to work by noon.

200
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:44,835
That's fantastic.

201
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:46,968
- Case.
- Yeah?

202
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,476
Nothing's gonna stop them
from taking down that platform.

203
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:53,143
Nothing. And when we're done,
I'm out of a job.

204
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:56,752
There's nothing anyone can do about it.
It's inevitable.

205
00:22:56,842 --> 00:23:00,153
Well, then you'll find something else.
You're a NASA engineer.

206
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:03,657
With nothing to launch.

207
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,925
- There are two wolves.
- Case.

208
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:13,002
You told me this story my entire life,
and now I'm telling you.

209
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:17,170
There are two wolves,
and they're always fighting.

210
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:20,833
One is darkness and despair.

211
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:24,013
The other is light and hope.

212
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,613
Which wolf wins?

213
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,942
Come on, Case.

214
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:32,453
Okay. Fine, don't answer.

215
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,189
Whichever one you feed.

216
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:39,223
Good.

217
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,021
Eat.

218
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:43,625
Come on.

219
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:48,431
Mutually assured destruction.

220
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:53,441
Today, any nuclear country or terrorist
is capable of inﬂicting damage

221
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:56,706
on a massive scale with weapons of...

222
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,778
Environmental entropy.

223
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:01,784
The polar ice caps
aren't waiting for us to decide

224
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:03,911
if climate change is real.

225
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:07,219
Rising coastal waters,
intensifying weather patterns.

226
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,226
They're all punching
our one-way ticket to...

227
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:14,057
Dystopia. By definition, "not perfect."

228
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,221
Huxley's <i>Brave New World,</i>

229
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,564
Bradbury's <i>Fahrenheit 451,</i>

230
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:21,264
Orwell's <i>1984.</i>

231
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:23,739
Once considered fiction,
these futuristic novels

232
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,640
are actually happening right now
and they seem to be getting worse.

233
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:27,904
Yes, Miss Newton?

234
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,476
Can we fix it?

235
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:31,437
Sorry?

236
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:35,848
I get things are bad.
But what are we doing to fix it?

237
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:41,251
Have a good weekend, everybody.

238
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:23,323
- Newton?
- Yeah.

239
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:25,528
You made bail.
Motorcycle is in impound.

240
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:28,036
You can pick up
your personal effects over there.

241
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:35,874
- Newton?
- Yeah.

242
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,410
All right.

243
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:49,590
All right.

244
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:53,652
Okay, one money clip, $47.32,

245
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:56,528
one Florida state driver's license,
one baseball cap.

246
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,599
You got one pin,

247
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,692
one pack of Beemans gum,
and I don't know what this is.

248
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,432
Sign here.

249
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,779
- That's not mine.
- What's not yours?

250
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:15,215
The pin. I've never...

251
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,862
No way.

252
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:09,996
Have I been here the whole time?

253
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:12,498
I know.

254
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,572
No!

255
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,071
I got it.

256
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,341
You have no idea
of the strings I had to pull

257
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,828
to keep Homeland Security
from pressing charges, Casey.

258
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,160
This is not just vandalism. All right?

259
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:39,759
- It's NASA. It's government property.
- Have you ever seen this before?

260
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:43,340
You're not getting it, are you?
I am very upset with you!

261
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:44,908
I get it, you're angry. I understand.

262
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,050
But I just need you to look at it.
Does it look weird?

263
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:50,212
- Don't touch it!
- Why are you yelling at me?

264
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:52,781
Not while you're driving, Dad.
It's dangerous.

265
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,374
Just pull over.

266
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,110
Pull over.

267
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:00,514
I swear to God, Case,
if you're on drugs...

268
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:03,218
I'm not on drugs. Just look.

269
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,359
I need you to be NASA Dad now.

270
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:09,364
New Frontier Dad. Okay?

271
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:17,134
All will be explained
as soon as you touch this pin.

272
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,245
What is...

273
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,481
It's networking?

274
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,730
You're not seeing this?

275
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:44,993
Stop it.

276
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:50,429
Honestly, Casey,
I don't know what's gotten into you.

277
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,354
Middle of the night...

278
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:49,516
- A little help, guys?
- Zen move, Dexter.

279
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,882
Totally swift.

280
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,852
Come on, idiots.
We're gonna be late for R and D.

281
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:54,345
<i>The HoverRail will be
arriving in one minute.</i>

282
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:20,032
- Are you coming?
- You can see me?

283
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,007
We don't have all day.

284
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:24,542
Wait for us!

285
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:27,445
<i>Northbound line now departing.</i>

286
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:32,285
<i>Next stop, Spaceport.</i>

287
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,995
Wow! Look at the rings!

288
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,174
Wow! Cool!

289
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,574
Be sure to follow the procedures strictly.

290
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,373
You know how you need your sleep.

291
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,004
Dad, you're embarrassing me.

292
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,175
- Do you promise to transmit every day?
- Even when you're out of range.

293
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,618
Come on, what's the big deal?
We're only going 20 light-years out.

294
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,751
<i>Now arriving, Spaceport.</i>

295
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:22,395
Come on, please.

296
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,061
I'll be okay.

297
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:27,464
Hey, guys. Over here.

298
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:28,663
- Hey!
- Hey!

299
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,574
Come on, please! I love you guys.

300
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:35,803
You're going to make me cry in
front of my friends, okay?

301
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,742
Bye! Bye!

302
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:03,198
Come on. We saved a seat just for you.

303
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:15,178
Now you run out of power?

304
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:20,182
- Nate, wake up!
- I didn't do it!

305
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:21,518
Dad changed
the password to his computer.

306
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:22,956
Do you know it?

307
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:25,155
You smell like swamp.

308
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,176
Tell me the password
and you can go back to sleep.

309
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,687
Your phone has Internet.

310
00:36:29,154 --> 00:36:33,125
- My phone got soaked in a lagoon.
- Fine.

311
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,298
What are we looking for?

312
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:40,236
Here we go.

313
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:41,700
Stop! That's it.

00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:13,541
- Can you do that for me?
- Only if you tell me what's going on.

325
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:20,880
I think that I saw...

326
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:26,951
That I went to the future.

327
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:31,554
Can I come, too?

328
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:35,220
Not yet.

329
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:02,087
Hello! Is Casey Newton home?

330
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:04,155
No.

331
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,454
She ordered some cookies
and I'm delivering them.

332
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:10,228
- You're a Girl Scout?
- Of course I am.

333
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:13,301
- Why aren't you wearing a uniform?
- It's at the cleaners.

334
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,462
Those are Oreos.

335
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:19,902
Could you please tell me
when Casey will be back?

336
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:21,767
She went camping with some friends.

337
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:23,904
She's gonna be gone
for a couple of days.

338
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:26,309
Is that what you've told your parents?

339
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:30,482
- Yeah.
- But it's not true.

340
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:33,920
- Yeah, it is.
- No, Nathan. It's not.

341
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:36,456
Don't ask me how I know your name.

342
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:40,018
I know it the same way
I know that you are lying to me.

343
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,029
Are you from the future?

344
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,994
You clearly understand.

345
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:48,263
So why aren't you
telling me what I need to know?

346
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:52,771
That pin thing, it stopped working.

347
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,708
She went to find another one.

348
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:57,279
Nathan, where is she looking?

349
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:10,157
<i>That's one small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind.</i>

350
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:27,135
Hello?

351
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:31,745
Sale this week.
Front three shelves. 70% off.

352
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:34,043
No, thanks.
I'm not hereto buy anything.

353
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:38,353
I was hoping that
you could tell me about this.

354
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:43,916
Hugo!

355
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:46,689
Hugo!

356
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:48,155
One second.

357
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:53,060
Welcome to Blast From The...

358
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:57,601
Thank you for the help, dear.

359
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:59,368
Well, if you just kept it open,
you wouldn't need my help.

360
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,432
If I kept it open, it would ruin
the effect, which is everything.

361
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,409
Pardon my wife.
She has no respect for showmanship.

362
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:06,004
- Hugo Gernsback. How may I help you?
- She has a pin.

363
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,179
She has a pin.

364
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,110
I saw that you were
looking for one online...

365
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:13,917
- Where did you get it?
- What can you tell me about it?

366
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:16,549
I can't tell you anything about it
unless you tell me who gave it to you.

367
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:17,957
I'm not going first.

368
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,027
Well, it seems
our business here is done.

369
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:24,089
It seems it is.

370
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:32,268
Saw something, didn't you?

371
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:36,541
When you touched it.

372
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:40,374
Something incredible.

373
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,786
- It's real?
- Of course it is.

374
00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:47,220
Don't ask me how.

375
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,839
These people have
developed technologies

376
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,587
we haven't even dreamed of yet.

377
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:53,160
Wait. What people?

378
00:40:58,256 --> 00:41:00,896
Have you ever wondered
what would happen

379
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:04,771
if all the geniuses,
the artists, the scientists,

380
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:08,641
the smartest,
most creative people in the world,

381
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:11,577
decided to actually change it?

382
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:14,414
But where?

383
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,850
Where could they
even do such a thing?

384
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:20,354
They'd need a place
free from politics and bureaucracy,

385
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:22,823
distractions, greed.

386
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:26,191
A secret place where they could build

387
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:29,026
whatever they were
crazy enough to imagine.

388
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:32,164
"Plus Ultra" they call themselves.

389
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:36,432
The only way to see it, however,
is through contact with one of these.

390
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,269
Why did they make them?
What are they for?

391
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:40,966
Rumor has it

392
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:43,137
- they were about to go public.
- Yeah.

393
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:45,679
Share what they had built
with the whole world.

394
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,944
Unfortunately, that never happened.

395
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,312
Why not?

396
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,986
I think we've shared enough,
young lady.

397
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:01,023
So, as we've decided to trust you,

398
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:05,659
please trust us
and tell me where'd you get it?

399
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:08,726
I don't know.

400
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,835
What do you mean, honey?

401
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:15,740
I kind of got arrested
and it was in with my stuff.

402
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,704
- In with your stuff?
- Yeah, I don't know how it got there.

403
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:23,512
What was that?

404
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:27,386
- Tell us who gave it to you. Please.
- No one gave it to me!

405
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:31,224
That's very unlikely, sweetheart.

406
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,359
You know what?

407
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:38,262
I think I'm gonna go now.
Thanks for your help.

408
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:41,263
$1,000 if you tell me
where you acquired the pin.

409
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:42,394
I don't know!

410
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,495
- $10,000.
- Was it a girl? A little girl?

411
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,371
I don't know
what you guys are talking about.

412
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:48,411
Have a nice day. Enjoy your freak out.

413
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,910
Tell us where she is
and you will be spared.

414
00:42:54,005 --> 00:42:55,450
This is a joke, right?

415
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:02,955
Where's the girl?

416
00:43:06,117 --> 00:43:08,461
I don't... I don't know about...

417
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:42,153
You will tell us about the girl.

418
00:43:42,253 --> 00:43:44,995
I don't know any girl. I told you...

419
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:48,933
- Where is the girl?
- I don't know any girl!

420
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:03,074
We have to go!

421
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:06,645
Come on. Now!

422
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:10,686
This is a time bomb.
It stops time, but not for long!

423
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:13,022
- What?
- Listen to me.

424
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:16,655
The sphere is collapsing
and you're in the line of fire.

425
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:19,826
We need to go or you will die.

426
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,639
I'm stuck!

427
00:44:24,195 --> 00:44:26,869
- I'm stuck!
- But only temporarily.

428
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:30,342
Take my hand. The moment you're free,
I'll pull you clear.

429
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:31,845
Then stay behind me.

430
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,205
Ready?

431
00:44:50,288 --> 00:44:51,289
The girl.

432
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:31,865
Look out!

433
00:45:42,273 --> 00:45:43,377
We have to go.

434
00:45:44,175 --> 00:45:46,849
They're about to self-destruct.
We have to go now!

435
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:51,291
Crazy enough to imagine.
Crazy enough to imagine.

436
00:46:03,561 --> 00:46:04,767
Casey, get up.

437
00:46:05,463 --> 00:46:07,033
They'll be coming.

438
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:08,907
What? Who?

439
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:14,114
- I don't know what... I can't get into...
- I know, I know.

440
00:46:14,205 --> 00:46:15,878
Get in the car, Casey!

441
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:18,979
How do you know my name?

442
00:46:19,377 --> 00:46:21,050
Just get in the car.

443
00:46:35,593 --> 00:46:36,765
What just happened?

444
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:39,330
Two AA units targeted you
for extermination.

445
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,808
I saved your life. They self-destructed.

446
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:42,900
Wait. “AAs"?

447
00:46:43,434 --> 00:46:44,674
Audio-Animatronics.

448
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:48,908
- They were robots?
- No. Advanced anthropomo...

449
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:54,283
Sure. Okay. Robots.

450
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:56,955
Wait, wait. Who are you?

451
00:46:57,782 --> 00:47:01,195
My name is Athena.
I'm the one who gave you the pin.

452
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:03,658
The pin? The pin!

453
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,199
Yes. And I do wish you hadn't run off

454
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:09,294
before I had a chance to give you
some rather necessary context.

455
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,704
Context? What are you
even talking about?

456
00:47:11,796 --> 00:47:14,504
How are you driving a car?
Who are you?

457
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,778
I'm a <i> cruder >.</i>

458
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:21,182
<i>Re... I'm a recruton.</i>

459
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:30,186
<i>60 seconds to self-destruct.</i>

460
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:38,030
So sorry about that.

461
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:42,535
- You're one of them?
Obviously.

462
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:53,876
Where are you going?
Stop! I'm trying to help you!

463
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:01,715
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

464
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:16,227
Hey!

465
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:18,696
Hey!

466
00:48:28,506 --> 00:48:31,578
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

467
00:48:34,512 --> 00:48:35,957
No way!

468
00:48:47,792 --> 00:48:50,568
- Let me out of this car!
- Stop yelling!

469
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:53,231
- Let me out now!
- No! I will not!

470
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:55,709
I gave you my very last pin, young lady,

471
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,871
and I am not about to let it go to waste.

472
00:48:58,035 --> 00:49:00,379
What do you mean your last pin?

473
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:06,551
Wait, that place I saw...

474
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:11,958
- It exists?
- Of course it does.

475
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:16,391
But if you don't come with me,
it won't for much longer.

476
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,059
Why not?

477
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:21,043
Because they built something
they shouldn't have.

478
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:23,936
Built what?

479
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:25,934
Do you want to keep
asking me questions

480
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:28,738
- until someone arrives to murder us?
- No.

481
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,610
Then which way do you want to go?

482
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:36,179
Backwards or forwards?

483
00:49:37,675 --> 00:49:40,246
- And you can take me there?
- I can.

484
00:49:43,948 --> 00:49:44,983
I'm driving.

485
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:49,861
Okie-dokie.
You fellas are released. Thanks.

486
00:49:51,522 --> 00:49:52,967
Alrighty, boys.

487
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:57,830
Fire chief says
we're clear to go in and poke around.

488
00:49:57,928 --> 00:49:59,339
Hopefully, they were out for lunch

489
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:01,501
and nobody was in
there when she went boom.

490
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:02,700
Captain.

491
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:11,047
Afternoon, sir.
Dave Clark, Secret Service.

492
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:16,514
Looks like you got
yourself a doozy here.

493
00:50:16,614 --> 00:50:19,322
Secret Service?
Hey, where are they going?

494
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:20,583
They're securing the premises.

495
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:23,962
Thanks so much for your help,
but we're going to take it from here.

496
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:28,563
Hey, Dale.
I found this just outside the window.

497
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,867
You ever seen anything like it?

498
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:34,866
What the hell?

499
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:36,807
God almighty!

500
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:39,643
<i>Sale. This week. 70 perce...</i>

501
00:50:39,904 --> 00:50:43,477
<i>Was it a girl? A little girl?
Was it a girl? A little girl?</i>

502
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:47,652
You wanna tell me
what's going on here, son?

503
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,987
No, sir. I do not.

504
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:56,655
<i>Was it a girl? A little girl?</i>

505
00:50:57,187 --> 00:50:58,928
Contact Governor Nix.

506
00:51:00,324 --> 00:51:01,997
Tell him we found the girl.

507
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:03,661
Veer left!

508
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:07,108
Little more of a heads up next time.

509
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:09,864
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't you
just tell me where we're going?

510
00:51:09,867 --> 00:51:12,848
- Pittsfield, New York.
- What's in Pittsfield, New York?

511
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:14,948
Someone who can get us back in.

512
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:18,443
Hold on.
You said that you gave me your last pin.

513
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:20,351
How many other people
did you give them to?

514
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:21,412
Not important.

515
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:23,623
I'm not even your first choice.

516
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:26,519
I only found you
a month ago when you started

517
00:51:26,617 --> 00:51:28,858
wantonly destroying
government property.

518
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,023
Which happens to go

519
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,862
on my search parameters
for recruitment.

520
00:51:32,523 --> 00:51:36,972
Not to mention you scored a 73
on the Feynman/Drumrnnelberg scale.

521
00:51:37,061 --> 00:51:39,735
73? Is that good?

522
00:51:39,897 --> 00:51:42,275
Wait. Hold on. Recruitment for what?

523
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:43,810
I'm not allowed to answer that.

524
00:51:43,901 --> 00:51:45,141
Who's not allowing you?

525
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:47,613
I'm not allowed to answer that.
And I should warn you,

526
00:51:47,705 --> 00:51:51,243
you keep asking me questions, and my
Countermeasure Protocol will initiate.

527
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:55,085
- Okay. And what does that mean?
- I will shut down.

528
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:58,560
- You will not.
- Try me.

529
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:05,823
You said that they built
something they shouldn't have.

530
00:52:05,923 --> 00:52:08,767
Did something happen over there?
Something bad?

531
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:11,295
Son of a...

532
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:29,417
Please don't answer.
Please don't answer.

533
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:33,484
<i>Hey, you've reached
Eddie Newton's cell phone.</i>

534
00:52:33,584 --> 00:52:36,087
<i>Leave me a message
and I will call you back.</i>

535
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:38,930
Hey, Dad. It's Casey.

536
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:43,932
I told Nate to tell you that I was
camping, but I'm not camping.

537
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,031
And I just don't like lying to you.

538
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:50,040
But I didn't know
how to tell you the truth because...

539
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:56,315
Something highly unusual
is happening, and...

540
00:52:57,374 --> 00:52:58,876
Okay. My point is...

541
00:52:59,777 --> 00:53:02,724
<i>I'm fine. I will continue to be fine.</i>

542
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:06,290
<i>I'm not on drugs. I haven't joined a cult.</i>

543
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:07,724
<i>I won't be gone long.</i>

544
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:12,498
<i>And I will call again soon.
I love you, Dad.</i>

545
00:53:18,162 --> 00:53:20,733
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

546
00:53:20,898 --> 00:53:22,969
Yes. Fine, thank you.

547
00:53:23,734 --> 00:53:26,305
I thought I broke you or something.

548
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:32,142
I should drive.

549
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:36,813
Casey, I know you have
no reason to trust me.

550
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,487
But I've been looking for someone
like you for a very long time.

551
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:42,419
Now, please,

552
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:45,424
pull over.

553
00:53:56,033 --> 00:53:58,912
Of all the people
you could give one of those pins to,

554
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:02,710
Why me?

555
00:54:03,507 --> 00:54:04,850
Because you're special.

556
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:09,217
- Yeah. I'm special.
- You are.

557
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,923
So, this guy we're gonna go see,

558
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:23,128
what's his name?

559
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:27,041
His name is Frank.

560
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:30,408
<i>Frank Walker.</i>

561
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:33,206
He's special, too.

562
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:37,412
Frank Walker.

563
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:06,311
Hey! Wait, what are you doing?

564
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:13,911
Just great.

565
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,719
Where are your paw prints?

566
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:40,171
That is cool.

567
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:12,767
I can hear you, you know.

568
00:57:12,863 --> 00:57:15,366
Go away. Didn't you see the dog?

569
00:57:15,866 --> 00:57:18,210
Yeah. It's a hologram.

570
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,270
How did you do that in daylight?

571
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:22,781
- It's pretty impressive.
- Who are you?

572
00:57:22,873 --> 00:57:24,216
What do you want?

573
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:26,217
You're Frank Walker, right?

574
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:31,090
My name's Casey,
and I want you to take me there.

575
00:57:31,915 --> 00:57:33,895
Take you where?

576
00:57:35,052 --> 00:57:37,555
To the place I saw when I touched this.

577
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:54,844
Where'd you get this?

578
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:58,249
A little girl. Athena.

579
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:00,080
Where is she?

580
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:01,920
She ditched me here.

581
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:05,316
Of course she did.

582
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:08,760
Look, wherever you came from, kid,
go back.

583
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:11,860
No, I want you to take me there.
What I saw...

584
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:14,265
What you saw is gone.

585
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:18,306
This, what you're looking for,
it doesn't exist anymore.

586
00:58:18,362 --> 00:58:22,367
No. I feel like I have to go.
Like I'm supposed to go.

587
00:58:22,466 --> 00:58:23,672
Why?

588
00:58:23,767 --> 00:58:27,010
Because they're saving
a seat on the rocket ship just for you?

589
00:58:29,106 --> 00:58:32,679
What you saw was a commercial
that was recorded decades ago.

590
00:58:32,943 --> 00:58:36,686
It was an invitation that never went out
because the damn party got canceled.

591
00:58:37,481 --> 00:58:39,859
You are not supposed to do anything.

592
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:44,364
You've been manipulated to feel
like you're part of something incredible.

593
00:58:45,122 --> 00:58:46,533
Like you were special.

594
00:58:47,324 --> 00:58:48,462
But you weren't.

595
00:58:50,327 --> 00:58:51,328
You're not.

596
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:55,469
So that's a no?

597
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:13,077
Son of a...

598
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,317
You little...

599
01:00:48,512 --> 01:00:50,924
<i>You know, I can call the cops anytime.</i>

600
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:52,255
Anytime!

601
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:55,793
You have...
I'm giving you five seconds...

602
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:08,935
lam not leaving!

603
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:11,377
Either tell me how to
get there or kill me!

604
01:01:11,468 --> 01:01:15,848
If you touch anything in there,
that's exactly what I'll do!

605
01:01:18,475 --> 01:01:19,613
What are you doing?

606
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,713
I'm touching things!

607
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:26,886
Open this door now!

608
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:31,291
I mean it. I'll knock you out.

609
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:40,468
Hey, what's this doohickey
with the trombone slidey thing?

610
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,373
Leave that alone. I'm serious!

611
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:45,209
- Will you take me there?
- No!

612
01:01:45,302 --> 01:01:47,009
Then you're not serious!

613
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:52,313
Come on.

614
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:55,151
You didn't think that was funny?

615
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:57,021
You're recording this?

616
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:00,653
If I get you to laugh, I wanna, you know,
have it for posterity.

617
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:02,724
I laughed.

618
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:05,163
You smiled. A smile's not a laugh.

619
01:02:05,589 --> 01:02:08,399
Everyone laughs. It's a biological need.

620
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:11,734
Actually, it isn't.
Sleep is a biological need.

621
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:13,830
I've never seen you sleep, either.

622
01:02:16,166 --> 01:02:18,772
Well, sooner or later,
I'm gonna make you laugh.

623
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,882
Until you do, I'm not gonna stop trying.

624
01:02:22,339 --> 01:02:24,012
Maybe you should.

625
01:02:25,175 --> 01:02:26,347
What?

626
01:02:27,177 --> 01:02:28,747
Stop trying.

627
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:32,754
Why?

628
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:36,624
Must we record this?

629
01:03:36,246 --> 01:03:37,919
- Get out!
- Wait a second.

630
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:39,824
What is that? Is that a countdown?

631
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:42,260
I am not leaving. I deserve to
know what's going on around here.

632
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,199
- You deserve...
- Yeah, I deserve some answers.

633
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:46,028
- Answers to what?
- I know that you were there.

634
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:47,260
You don't know anything.

635
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:48,962
How do you ever
leave a place like that?

636
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:50,368
Because they threw me oui!

637
01:03:56,466 --> 01:03:59,936
They threw me out
and they locked every door back in.

638
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:06,280
Was it because you built
that something that you shouldn't have?

639
01:04:06,476 --> 01:04:07,614
Who told you that?

640
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:09,348
And is that it?

641
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:12,286
The "something"?

642
01:04:15,452 --> 01:04:17,295
If I could tell you the date,

643
01:04:17,821 --> 01:04:20,995
the exact date that you're gonna die,
would you wanna know?

644
01:04:21,124 --> 01:04:23,730
- How would you know?
- Let's just say I did.

645
01:04:23,827 --> 01:04:25,568
- What are you, a psychic?
- No, that's not the point.

646
01:04:25,662 --> 01:04:26,868
Then what is your basis for knowing?

647
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:28,408
- It's a hypothetical.
- It's a stupid hypothetical.

648
01:04:28,498 --> 01:04:31,001
Just use your imagination. All right?

649
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:33,208
- All right.
- Okay.

650
01:04:33,803 --> 01:04:35,373
Let's accept that there is a world

651
01:04:35,472 --> 01:04:40,683
where I know, with absolute certainty,
the exact time of your death.

652
01:04:41,644 --> 01:04:43,988
Now, you want me to tell you or not?

653
01:04:44,814 --> 01:04:46,657
Yeah, of course I would. Who wouldn't?

654
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:54,269
But what if accepting my death
is what causes it?

655
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:57,997
So the answer is yes.
I would want you to tell me.

656
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:00,774
- But I wouldn't believe you.
- You have to believe me.

657
01:05:00,864 --> 01:05:03,674
Why? Don't we, like,
make our own destiny and stuff?

658
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:12,679
What?

659
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:21,359
Who are you, kid?

660
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:27,300
Is that bad?

661
01:05:30,527 --> 01:05:31,562
Hell.

662
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:33,867
Hell!

663
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:47,955
- They followed you here?
- What? Who?

664
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:49,717
Robots.

665
01:05:50,914 --> 01:05:52,450
I've never seen them before.

666
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:55,229
<i>John Francis Walker.</i>

667
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:56,389
<i>You have been permitted to live</i>

668
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:58,433
<i>based upon your
agreed non-intervention.</i>

669
01:05:58,488 --> 01:06:00,798
<i>You are now harboring
a fugitive element.</i>

670
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:03,234
<i>Release her to our custody
or be extinguished.</i>

671
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:05,797
<i>You have one minute to comply.</i>

672
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:23,246
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me yet.

673
01:06:42,265 --> 01:06:43,300
Wait.

674
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:51,837
Come on!

675
01:08:14,724 --> 01:08:15,759
Let's go!

676
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:24,939
John Francis Walker,
by authority of Governor Nix,

677
01:08:25,034 --> 01:08:26,445
this unit has been authorized

678
01:08:26,536 --> 01:08:27,776
<i>To extinguish your life.</i>

679
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,314
Okay.

680
01:08:37,747 --> 01:08:38,953
Okay

681
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:43,457
All right, that's enough. That's enough!

682
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:48,933
Come on. Close the door.

683
01:08:49,993 --> 01:08:51,768
Who the hell is Governor Nix?

684
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:54,775
Let's go. Come on.

685
01:08:55,732 --> 01:08:57,075
Get in.

686
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:02,105
How is this a good idea?

687
01:09:35,438 --> 01:09:36,781
Move or sink, kid.

688
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,978
You were actually prepared for that?

689
01:09:48,651 --> 01:09:50,460
- My hat.
- Leave it.

690
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:52,123
No, no, no. I can't go without it.

691
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,132
It's my dads.

692
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,502
Now I get it.

693
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:05,805
Too smart for your own good.

694
01:10:06,836 --> 01:10:10,374
Father never understood you,
never supported you.

695
01:10:10,473 --> 01:10:15,320
And now you wear
his hat as a badge of rebellion, right?

696
01:10:16,646 --> 01:10:18,990
No. My dad is amazing.

697
01:10:22,552 --> 01:10:24,691
Wait a second.

698
01:10:25,822 --> 01:10:27,665
We're not talking about me, are we?

699
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:33,334
Why don't we just get you
to your amazing dad

700
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:34,841
and pretend this never happened?

701
01:10:35,832 --> 01:10:36,833
Hop on.

702
01:10:39,836 --> 01:10:41,406
- The battery's dead.
- No, it's not.

703
01:10:41,504 --> 01:10:43,916
- Then maybe it's the points.
- No, it's not.

704
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:47,385
- When's the last time you checked...
- You know, you're not helping. <i>You...</i>

705
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:50,688
Get down. Now.

706
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:06,600
Wait.

707
01:11:09,866 --> 01:11:10,936
Hello, Frank.

708
01:11:18,708 --> 01:11:20,278
Are you going to shoot me?

709
01:11:22,311 --> 01:11:25,292
- I'm deciding.
- Could you decide in the truck?

710
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:27,224
Because we really should get going.

711
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:32,555
- Wait.
- Why? So more robots can show up?

712
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:36,429
She's one of them.

713
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:38,333
Yeah, I know. Are you coming or not?

714
01:11:44,834 --> 01:11:46,404
Move over.

715
01:12:06,522 --> 01:12:08,297
- Frank...
- Not yet.

716
01:12:09,859 --> 01:12:12,465
What are you thinking?
Why would you drag her into this?

717
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:16,169
I didn't drag her into anything.
I gave her a pin.

718
01:12:16,265 --> 01:12:17,539
She did the rest.

719
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:19,502
Just like you.

720
01:12:19,602 --> 01:12:23,140
Don't even.
Where did you even find the pin?

721
01:12:23,206 --> 01:12:24,685
I was there. They destroyed 'em.

722
01:12:24,774 --> 01:12:27,846
Not all of them.
I made it out with nearly a dozen.

723
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:29,355
So you give one to a teenager.

724
01:12:29,445 --> 01:12:32,858
Hey, I got a 73 on the
Feinberg/Dusseldorf scale or whatever.

725
01:12:32,949 --> 01:12:35,190
You got a 73? That's not possible.

726
01:12:35,284 --> 01:12:37,525
He's jealous because he scored a 41.

727
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:40,692
You know what? I was 11. I was 11!

728
01:12:41,123 --> 01:12:43,125
Hey, don't touch that!

729
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:47,698
This is a one-kiloton detonation.
It is not a toy.

730
01:12:47,797 --> 01:12:50,004
Do not mess with my stuff.

731
01:12:50,066 --> 01:12:51,204
- You got it?
- Sorry!

732
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,837
I didn't begin with her, you know.

733
01:12:53,903 --> 01:12:56,713
I wasted years
on other potential candidates.

734
01:12:56,806 --> 01:12:58,479
Potential candidates? For what?

735
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:02,151
That's beautiful.

736
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:04,487
You still think
you're recruiting, don't you?

737
01:13:04,547 --> 01:13:06,185
Do not ask her any more questions.

738
01:13:06,249 --> 01:13:08,058
She's gonna do her
countermeasure shutdown thing.

739
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:09,550
What countermeasure shutdown thing?

740
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:11,361
Did you tell her you had
a countermeasure shutdown thing?

741
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:15,061
- She was annoying me.
- You lied?

742
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:16,500
Get used to that, kid.

743
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:18,559
One minute,
she's promising you a beautiful future,

744
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:21,370
the next thing you know,
she's leading it to your house to kill you.

745
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:24,411
I'm sorry, but time is running out
and you needed motivation.

746
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,535
Motivation for what?

747
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:29,011
- We need to go back over, Frank.
- Back over there?

748
01:13:29,672 --> 01:13:31,273
Yes, yes, Frank,
we need to go back over.

749
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:32,842
Good. Great. That's just great.

750
01:13:32,942 --> 01:13:36,583
You know, hey, I got stung by a bee.
Let's jump on the hive.

751
01:13:36,679 --> 01:13:38,352
That's a terrible analogy.

752
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:41,088
That's a fantastic analogy.
What do you know about analogies?

753
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:43,424
You know, you're impossible to talk
to when you're like this.

754
01:13:43,519 --> 01:13:46,932
I am like this because
you derailed my life.

755
01:13:47,023 --> 01:13:48,093
Again.

756
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:50,636
Frank, it's not personal.

757
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:52,630
It's just programming.

758
01:13:54,964 --> 01:13:56,034
We're here!

759
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:04,609
Where are you going?

760
01:14:04,707 --> 01:14:07,711
This is where
your wire station's located, isn't it?

761
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:09,450
We need to get to The Spectacle.

762
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:11,889
Spectacle?
- Hey. Are you insane?

763
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:14,451
They know that you sent her to me.
They're gonna be waiting for us.

764
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:17,394
Fine. Give me the Edison tube
and we'll go without you.

765
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:20,491
- I don't have the Edison tube.
- It's in your bag.

766
01:14:21,324 --> 01:14:23,065
I have x-ray vision.

767
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:26,004
- When did you get x-ray vision?
- She's full of surprises.

768
01:14:26,095 --> 01:14:27,438
I know all about her surprises.

769
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:30,773
Chief among them is this.
She doesn't care about you.

770
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:35,244
All that charm and the sense
of purpose, and the cute little smile,

771
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:36,974
it's all just software.

772
01:14:37,073 --> 01:14:39,417
It's ones and zeroes. That's it.

773
01:14:40,676 --> 01:14:43,589
Trust me, when you get there,
you're on your own.

774
01:14:44,747 --> 01:14:47,990
- What happened to you two?
- He thinks I hurt him.

775
01:14:48,084 --> 01:14:51,588
No, you hurt a dumb kid
that was stupid enough to fall...

776
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:58,669
You were many things, Frank Walker.

777
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:03,506
But you were never dumb.

778
01:15:09,005 --> 01:15:10,712
Why don't you just give me
the Edison tube, and...

779
01:15:10,806 --> 01:15:12,877
I'm not giving you anything. I'm...

780
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:20,460
All right.

781
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:23,326
You want in? I'll bring you in.

782
01:15:23,386 --> 01:15:24,865
Why not?

783
01:15:24,954 --> 01:15:26,834
It's better than waiting
around here and getting

784
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:28,869
hunted and killed, etcetera, etcetera.

785
01:15:28,958 --> 01:15:32,496
- That's the spirit.
- "Etcetera"? What's the "etcetera"?

786
01:15:56,685 --> 01:15:59,723
- What kind of cables are these?
- The kind that transmit people.

787
01:16:00,156 --> 01:16:01,396
People? Like us?

788
01:16:01,824 --> 01:16:04,737
- What, like a miniature teleport...
- Do I have to explain everything?

789
01:16:05,161 --> 01:16:08,574
Can't you just be amazed and move on?

790
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:11,338
This is all wired to the dish up there.

791
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:16,683
Are you... Are you using satellite?

792
01:16:19,075 --> 01:16:20,418
I know how things work.

793
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,048
Well, zippity-doo for you.

794
01:16:24,847 --> 01:16:28,351
- Wrap this around your eyes, tight.
- Why?

795
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:30,419
Because justice is blind.

796
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,522
Just do it, kid.

797
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:37,360
You want me to put this over my head?

798
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,096
If this takes off my eyebrows...

799
01:16:40,196 --> 01:16:42,233
Shut up, open your mouth,
tilt your head back.

800
01:16:43,532 --> 01:16:44,875
What is that?

801
01:16:45,868 --> 01:16:47,575
It's powder. Are we at van 't Hoff?

802
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:49,583
Good to go!

803
01:16:49,638 --> 01:16:53,552
Good. You set it for the Tower?
There is still a receiver there?

804
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:55,748
- Last I checked.
- How long ago was that?

805
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:00,889
25 years ago.

806
01:17:03,152 --> 01:17:04,426
Roughly.

807
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:10,827
They threw you out, too?

808
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,907
Okay, guys. Killer robots.

809
01:17:15,931 --> 01:17:17,001
All right.

810
01:17:17,099 --> 01:17:19,773
It's gonna be
bright, cold, and really loud.

811
01:17:19,835 --> 01:17:22,406
You're gonna lose
90% of your blood sugar

812
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:23,745
in 1/100th of a second

813
01:17:23,806 --> 01:17:26,753
and you're gonna wish you were dead.
But then it'll be over.

814
01:17:28,244 --> 01:17:29,780
Don't pee on us.

815
01:17:29,845 --> 01:17:32,086
This sounds spectacular.

816
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:36,296
Why now? Why her?

817
01:17:37,186 --> 01:17:39,097
Because she hasn't given up.

818
01:17:39,255 --> 01:17:40,791
You think she can fix it.

819
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:43,800
What makes you say that?

820
01:17:46,695 --> 01:17:47,935
Can she, Athena?

821
01:17:48,764 --> 01:17:50,038
I have no idea.

822
01:17:51,767 --> 01:17:53,542
Let's go find out.

823
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:09,351
Is it... Is this normal?

824
01:18:29,972 --> 01:18:31,383
Thirsty.

825
01:18:31,473 --> 01:18:33,714
Dying. I think I'm dying.

826
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:35,880
- You're not dying!
- I'm dying.

827
01:18:35,978 --> 01:18:37,719
There's Coke in the fridge.

828
01:18:55,998 --> 01:18:57,341
Help yourself.

829
01:18:57,866 --> 01:19:00,403
We have no idea how many are here

830
01:19:00,502 --> 01:19:01,913
but we're damn sure
they know we're coming.

831
01:19:02,004 --> 01:19:04,041
So, we move quickly. You follow me.

832
01:19:04,106 --> 01:19:06,017
No questions. Got it?

833
01:19:07,176 --> 01:19:08,348
Got it.

834
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:17,920
Excuse me.

835
01:19:40,209 --> 01:19:43,281
- We're in Paris?
- Would you stop being so amazed?

836
01:19:43,379 --> 01:19:46,588
- I thought you wanted me to be amazed.
- I want you to stop yammer...

837
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:55,167
- Towel“s closing.
- Hell.

838
01:20:00,763 --> 01:20:01,935
Come on.

839
01:20:02,431 --> 01:20:04,604
Now, you and I are gonna be
on a watch list,

840
01:20:04,667 --> 01:20:07,773
but they may not have your facial
recognition profile uploaded yet.

841
01:20:07,836 --> 01:20:08,974
- "May not"?
- May not.

842
01:20:09,071 --> 01:20:12,450
So, you walk over there,
you take this, you tap him on the neck.

843
01:20:12,508 --> 01:20:15,580
- If he's human, it knocks him right out.
- And if it's a robot?

844
01:20:16,745 --> 01:20:18,747
- Hey!
- You'll just piss it off.

845
01:20:19,248 --> 01:20:20,454
Fantastic.

846
01:20:23,852 --> 01:20:25,957
She's got guts. You gotta give her that.

847
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:30,602
Yes, but I was just, you know...

848
01:20:33,095 --> 01:20:34,438
Human!

849
01:20:51,213 --> 01:20:53,454
The French hated
this thing when Eiffel first unveiled it

850
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:54,858
at the Paris World's Fair.

851
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:56,452
They thought it was an eyesore.

852
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:59,362
Eiffel didn't care, though.
It wasn't meant to be a monument.

853
01:20:59,455 --> 01:21:00,855
It was meant to find another world.

854
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:05,704
<i>Les Quatre Premiers.</i>
Plus Ultra's First Four.

855
01:21:05,794 --> 01:21:07,205
They were a part of all this?

856
01:21:07,296 --> 01:21:12,075
Eiffel, Jules Verne, Tesla,
and Mr. Edison.

857
01:21:14,036 --> 01:21:15,344
They designed this antenna
that we're inside.

858
01:21:15,404 --> 01:21:17,315
Wait, what?
The Eiffel Tower is an antenna?

859
01:21:17,373 --> 01:21:19,216
Now I finally answer your question,
you're gonna interrupt me?

860
01:21:19,641 --> 01:21:20,711
Yes.

861
01:21:20,809 --> 01:21:24,154
Tesla designed the antenna to observe
every kind of frequency out there.

862
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:26,659
Subspace, trans-dimensional,
you name it.

863
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:29,389
And they found exactly
what they were looking for.

864
01:21:29,485 --> 01:21:31,328
And then Edison tried
to take credit for it,

865
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:32,661
because these two hate each other.

866
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:34,121
- Frank...
Because of alternating...

867
01:21:34,156 --> 01:21:35,499
Stay on topic.

868
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:37,336
Yeah. All right, well...

869
01:21:38,827 --> 01:21:42,866
There were always rumors
of a secret entrance

870
01:21:42,931 --> 01:21:45,502
the Four kept just for themselves.

871
01:21:46,769 --> 01:21:51,013
A one-way ticket
in case of emergencies.

872
01:21:55,611 --> 01:21:56,681
The Spectacle.

873
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:31,384
You ain't seen nothing yet, kid.

874
01:23:37,179 --> 01:23:38,624
It's a rocket.

875
01:23:43,318 --> 01:23:44,456
They're coming.

876
01:23:45,554 --> 01:23:46,624
All right.

877
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:06,213
Buckle up!

878
01:24:23,659 --> 01:24:26,230
- What'd he say?
- Pretty much what you'd expect.

879
01:24:26,328 --> 01:24:27,602
Tell him to hang on.

880
01:25:39,234 --> 01:25:40,474
Why are we going back?

881
01:25:40,569 --> 01:25:44,142
We're not. We're going through
to another dimension.

882
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:47,152
So we blasted into outer space
just to get a running start?

883
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:49,589
This part may get a little weird.

884
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:48,140
<i>Casey. Wake up.</i>

885
01:26:50,472 --> 01:26:52,247
Casey.

886
01:26:53,308 --> 01:26:57,154
- Casey. Wake up.
- We're here.

887
01:27:44,025 --> 01:27:45,197
Now what?

888
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:47,736
You tell me.

889
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:51,873
- I tell you? This was your idea.
- I don't have ideas.

890
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:54,144
I just find the people who do.

891
01:27:54,236 --> 01:27:55,943
- So there's no plan?
- There's a plan.

892
01:27:56,037 --> 01:27:57,710
You just haven't come up with it yet.

893
01:27:58,774 --> 01:28:00,879
But you should do that soon.

894
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:06,787
That's just terrific.

895
01:28:07,649 --> 01:28:08,719
Here, hide this.

896
01:28:10,318 --> 01:28:11,763
Absolutely.

897
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:13,993
Wait. Is that
the one-kiloton detonation thingy

898
01:28:14,089 --> 01:28:15,397
you told me not to play with?

899
01:28:15,457 --> 01:28:16,765
Right now, it's our insurance policy.

900
01:28:16,825 --> 01:28:19,271
There's a good chance they're gonna
try to kill us right out of the gate.

901
01:28:19,327 --> 01:28:21,466
So we're just gonna stand here?

902
01:28:21,563 --> 01:28:24,305
Well, you wanted to see Tomorrowland.

903
01:28:25,233 --> 01:28:26,644
Here it comes.

904
01:28:52,961 --> 01:28:54,201
Take the bag.

905
01:29:00,302 --> 01:29:02,680
- Frank.
- David.

906
01:29:03,371 --> 01:29:04,543
You look well.

907
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:06,278
Age becomes you.

908
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:08,120
Thanks. You should try it.

909
01:29:08,944 --> 01:29:11,686
I don't know. I think I'll just keep
drinking my shake every morning.

910
01:29:12,113 --> 01:29:14,457
- Comes in chocolate now.
- Yum.

911
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:19,559
Hello, Athena.

912
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:21,822
I started to think
you were never coming home.

913
01:29:23,058 --> 01:29:24,662
Where, oh, where have you been?

914
01:29:25,227 --> 01:29:27,673
- Doing my jolt
- Your job?

915
01:29:28,296 --> 01:29:29,673
I'm sorry. Were we not clear

916
01:29:29,731 --> 01:29:31,870
when we suspended
your recruitment protocols?

917
01:29:31,967 --> 01:29:34,573
I got that sense when you
called me "bloody obsolete"

918
01:29:34,669 --> 01:29:36,148
and tried to disassemble me.

919
01:29:37,639 --> 01:29:40,313
Well, you've certainly
caused quite a commotion

920
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:43,913
by launching an antique rocket ship
out of the Eiffel Tower.

921
01:29:45,547 --> 01:29:47,185
Under normal circumstances,

922
01:29:47,249 --> 01:29:50,662
we'd be working overtime to convince
everyone it was just an elaborate hoax.

923
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:54,929
Fortunately, for all of us,
doesn't really matter now, does it?

924
01:29:55,357 --> 01:29:56,665
Why doesn't it matter?

925
01:29:58,593 --> 01:29:59,936
And who might you be?

926
01:30:01,663 --> 01:30:04,109
I'm Casey. Newton.

927
01:30:05,834 --> 01:30:07,711
And who might you be?

928
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:10,013
David Nix.

929
01:30:11,006 --> 01:30:12,041
Pleasure.

930
01:30:12,707 --> 01:30:15,051
Well, Frank, it's been
wonderful catching up,

931
01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:18,387
but as we were fairly clear
about the terms of your exile

932
01:30:18,446 --> 01:30:20,517
and the consequences of violating it,

933
01:30:20,582 --> 01:30:23,620
I have to ask
what the hell are you doing here?

934
01:30:23,718 --> 01:30:25,254
I think she can fix it.

935
01:30:29,057 --> 01:30:31,094
- I'm sorry.
- Her.

936
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:34,135
- I think she can fix it, David.
- Wait. What?

937
01:30:34,229 --> 01:30:35,469
I've been pirating your signal.

938
01:30:35,530 --> 01:30:38,409
Every time you turn it on here,
I can see it there.

939
01:30:38,466 --> 01:30:40,139
And it ﬂickered.

940
01:30:40,235 --> 01:30:42,237
The percentage dropped, David.

941
01:30:43,071 --> 01:30:44,243
Impossible.

942
01:30:44,706 --> 01:30:46,666
You don't believe me?
Let's go find out right now.

943
01:30:46,875 --> 01:30:50,618
- I'm sorry, what can I fix?
- The world, Miss Newton.

944
01:30:52,047 --> 01:30:54,550
He thinks you can fix the world.

945
01:31:18,006 --> 01:31:20,577
Is that like a portal to Earth?

946
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:23,952
No. It is a bridgeway to Earth.

947
01:31:29,918 --> 01:31:32,421
Welcome back to The Monitor, Frank.

948
01:31:33,621 --> 01:31:35,362
It's something, isn't it?

949
01:31:36,358 --> 01:31:37,632
Yeah, it's something.

950
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:56,288
Don't worry about the light show.

951
01:31:56,611 --> 01:31:58,147
It's perfectly safe.

952
01:32:01,182 --> 01:32:03,458
Am I supposed to do something?

953
01:32:04,185 --> 01:32:05,823
Okay, could you be a bit more specific?

954
01:32:05,887 --> 01:32:07,567
Because fixing
the world sounds a little...

955
01:32:07,622 --> 01:32:09,226
Just be yourself.

956
01:32:10,291 --> 01:32:11,634
Gotcha.

957
01:32:14,496 --> 01:32:16,066
Flashes of the future.

958
01:32:16,398 --> 01:32:19,675
- What are those?
- Flashes of future.

959
01:32:20,335 --> 01:32:22,212
This is us a few seconds from now.

960
01:32:22,871 --> 01:32:26,751
This whole tower
funnels energy via tachyon,

961
01:32:26,841 --> 01:32:29,219
a particle that
moves significantly faster than light.

962
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:31,916
We discovered them
almost 40 years ago.

963
01:32:32,013 --> 01:32:35,085
Your physicists
are still arguing over whether they exist.

964
01:32:35,183 --> 01:32:36,253
Oh, dear.

965
01:32:37,252 --> 01:32:38,322
Too late.

966
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:39,922
Oh, dear.

967
01:32:40,488 --> 01:32:41,489
Too late.

968
01:32:58,006 --> 01:32:59,713
So, on with the show.

969
01:33:01,176 --> 01:33:03,122
We've enhanced
the interface significantly

970
01:33:03,211 --> 01:33:06,021
but it still functions
on your original algorithm.

971
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:09,687
You have something
to show me, Frank?

972
01:33:10,452 --> 01:33:11,556
Show me.

973
01:33:23,531 --> 01:33:24,737
Pick a place.

974
01:33:26,067 --> 01:33:28,138
- What?
- A location anywhere in the world.

975
01:33:28,236 --> 01:33:29,374
Pick one.

976
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:32,273
Canaveral.

977
01:33:33,541 --> 01:33:34,884
Cape Canaveral.

978
01:33:48,923 --> 01:33:50,061
Easy, easy.

979
01:33:50,792 --> 01:33:54,968
The interface is oriented from
your hands to the center of the Earth.

980
01:33:55,396 --> 01:33:57,467
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.

981
01:34:02,737 --> 01:34:04,239
You trained her obviously.

982
01:34:04,939 --> 01:34:06,577
I just met her yesterday.

983
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:08,977
She knows how things work.

984
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:16,925
<i>You told me this story my entire life,
and now I'm telling you.</i>

985
01:34:16,985 --> 01:34:18,487
How is this possible?

986
01:34:18,586 --> 01:34:21,328
We are millions
of exponential deviances

987
01:34:21,422 --> 01:34:23,834
away from the dimension you call home.

988
01:34:23,925 --> 01:34:26,337
Frank had the novel idea
of building this machine

989
01:34:26,427 --> 01:34:28,703
so that we could keep in touch.

990
01:34:30,198 --> 01:34:31,643
This is three days ago.

991
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:33,511
Relatively.

992
01:34:34,936 --> 01:34:37,280
That's space/time humor.

993
01:34:39,974 --> 01:34:43,217
Because tachyons
travel faster than light,

994
01:34:43,311 --> 01:34:44,688
once we harness them...

995
01:34:44,779 --> 01:34:46,656
You can see backwards in time.

996
01:34:47,782 --> 01:34:48,988
Not just backwards.

997
01:34:51,386 --> 01:34:52,387
You're kidding.

998
01:34:53,621 --> 01:34:54,622
No.

999
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:20,925
What happened?

1000
01:35:21,182 --> 01:35:22,388
Keep going.

1001
01:35:23,251 --> 01:35:24,924
Just a little further.

1002
01:36:11,599 --> 01:36:12,634
That's enough.

1003
01:36:14,869 --> 01:36:16,246
That's enough, kid.

1004
01:36:22,043 --> 01:36:23,317
That's my house.

1005
01:36:24,545 --> 01:36:27,890
It would have been nice if Frank
had prepared you for this,

1006
01:36:28,483 --> 01:36:30,929
but I'm afraid the world is ending.

1007
01:36:31,386 --> 01:36:36,165
It is certain, it is unavoidable,
and it is coming.

1008
01:36:36,791 --> 01:36:37,895
When?

1009
01:36:39,594 --> 01:36:41,232
This is 58 days from now.

1010
01:36:42,063 --> 01:36:43,940
58 days?

1011
01:36:44,499 --> 01:36:48,072
But whatever caused this could happen
any time after the static starts.

1012
01:36:48,136 --> 01:36:49,809
It could be a month.

1013
01:36:49,904 --> 01:36:51,349
It could be sooner.

1014
01:37:00,515 --> 01:37:02,586
Still looking for your flicker, Frank?

1015
01:37:03,418 --> 01:37:04,590
I know what I saw.

1016
01:37:06,587 --> 01:37:08,999
So why aren't you telling anyone?

1017
01:37:09,090 --> 01:37:13,596
The whole planet is gonna die
and you're just sitting here?

1018
01:37:14,295 --> 01:37:15,603
We're not gonna die.

1019
01:37:16,331 --> 01:37:18,004
This is your world, not ours.

1020
01:37:18,433 --> 01:37:20,106
We'll be perfectly fine here.

1021
01:37:20,168 --> 01:37:22,512
Then why don't you let people in?

1022
01:37:23,771 --> 01:37:26,615
- Tell her, David.
- Frank.

1023
01:37:27,942 --> 01:37:31,219
All those years in exile,
and you still don't understand.

1024
01:37:31,312 --> 01:37:33,952
These people are driven by savagery.

1025
01:37:34,449 --> 01:37:36,895
If we told them about this place,

1026
01:37:38,052 --> 01:37:41,363
then that would happen here to us.

1027
01:37:41,456 --> 01:37:42,799
Then nothing would survive.

1028
01:37:43,024 --> 01:37:45,300
But it hasn't happened yet!

1029
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:47,863
Actually, it has happened.
You just haven't accepted it.

1030
01:37:47,962 --> 01:37:49,305
Well, I don't accept it!

1031
01:37:56,671 --> 01:37:58,981
Did you see that? Did you see that?

1032
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,678
David, I know that you saw that.

1033
01:38:00,742 --> 01:38:03,348
That means that there is a chance.
There's at least a chance...

1034
01:38:11,185 --> 01:38:13,062
That went quite well, don't you think?

1035
01:38:13,154 --> 01:38:15,862
- What happened?
- You're being deported.

1036
01:38:17,225 --> 01:38:18,568
Again.

1037
01:38:18,826 --> 01:38:21,397
Well, that's Nix for you.

1038
01:38:21,496 --> 01:38:23,737
No new ideas.

1039
01:38:23,831 --> 01:38:27,210
Apparently, your
1,110,000 variable in the inevitability

1040
01:38:27,268 --> 01:38:29,839
wasn't convincing enough
to change his mind.

1041
01:38:35,543 --> 01:38:36,954
Be gentle.

1042
01:38:47,889 --> 01:38:49,266
You okay?

1043
01:38:50,958 --> 01:38:53,029
You know, you'd think
somewhere in the zillions

1044
01:38:53,094 --> 01:38:56,598
of questions that I was asking you,
you could have said,

1045
01:38:56,697 --> 01:38:58,768
"Casey, that stuffs not really the issue

1046
01:38:58,866 --> 01:39:02,313
"because our future-predicting
machine says we're all gonna die."

1047
01:39:03,037 --> 01:39:04,812
We did sort of hint at it.

1048
01:39:04,906 --> 01:39:07,216
This place has nothing to do with hope.

1049
01:39:08,142 --> 01:39:09,644
It's the opposite of hope.

1050
01:39:09,877 --> 01:39:11,879
- Come on. Don't say that.
- Why not?

1051
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:13,984
You said it.

1052
01:39:14,882 --> 01:39:16,259
No wonder you gave up.

1053
01:39:16,784 --> 01:39:18,559
That's before I knew about you.

1054
01:39:18,953 --> 01:39:22,127
I mean, you really...
You really are special.

1055
01:39:22,223 --> 01:39:24,294
Why do you people
keep saying that to me?

1056
01:39:26,994 --> 01:39:28,405
I'm not!

1057
01:39:33,134 --> 01:39:34,738
Why'd you even give me this?

1058
01:39:35,570 --> 01:39:38,517
You showed me a place
that was amazing and incredible

1059
01:39:38,606 --> 01:39:40,415
and it was a lie.

1060
01:39:41,943 --> 01:39:43,854
If you're gonna zap an idea
into people's heads,

1061
01:39:43,945 --> 01:39:45,481
you should really make sure
that ifs the truth.

1062
01:39:45,580 --> 01:39:48,424
Because you can't do that.
You can't just zap...

1063
01:39:58,426 --> 01:39:59,496
What?

1064
01:40:00,461 --> 01:40:02,202
Zap an idea into people's heads.

1065
01:40:05,933 --> 01:40:07,776
You were pirating the signal.

1066
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:09,337
- How?
- What?

1067
01:40:09,437 --> 01:40:11,678
At your house.
All your TVs, your doomsday room.

1068
01:40:11,772 --> 01:40:13,809
You were boosting
the feed from that Monitor thing.

1069
01:40:13,875 --> 01:40:15,354
- How did you do that?
- No big deal.

1070
01:40:15,443 --> 01:40:19,186
They're running so much power through
it now, a ham radio could pick it up.

1071
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:21,487
It's just a matter of finding
the right frequency...

1072
01:40:23,284 --> 01:40:25,127
You grabbed a signal
from another dimension.

1073
01:40:25,653 --> 01:40:29,396
From a machine here.
That means it's transmitting there.

1074
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:32,164
What if it's not just
predicting the future?

1075
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:34,203
It's broadcasting it.

1076
01:40:34,662 --> 01:40:36,198
When I touched this thing

1077
01:40:36,297 --> 01:40:38,800
for a few minutes,
it felt like anything was possible.

1078
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:41,403
So then why can't the opposite happen?

1079
01:40:41,502 --> 01:40:44,039
What if The Monitor is just a giant pin?

1080
01:40:44,138 --> 01:40:45,879
But instead of making
you think positive,

1081
01:40:45,973 --> 01:40:48,317
it makes you think negative and it...

1082
01:40:49,477 --> 01:40:54,324
And it's convincing
the whole world to feed the wrong wolf.

1083
01:40:55,483 --> 01:40:57,156
We need to turn that thing off.

1084
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:04,164
It's time to go home.

1085
01:41:10,731 --> 01:41:12,540
David. David.

1086
01:41:13,935 --> 01:41:16,245
- It's uninhabited and uncharted.
- Listen to me.

1087
01:41:16,337 --> 01:41:19,079
But it looks like a lovely place
to spend your last days.

1088
01:41:19,173 --> 01:41:21,414
David... The Monitor is
acting as an antenna.

1089
01:41:21,509 --> 01:41:23,420
It isn't just receiving tachyons.

1090
01:41:23,511 --> 01:41:25,548
It is taking a possible future and...

1091
01:41:25,613 --> 01:41:28,594
And amplifying it,
transmitting it, like a feedback loop.

1092
01:41:28,683 --> 01:41:31,755
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy
that's coming from right there.

1093
01:41:31,852 --> 01:41:33,798
But it's not just
showing people the end of the world,

1094
01:41:33,888 --> 01:41:36,528
it's giving them the idea over and over
again until they just accept it!

1095
01:41:36,591 --> 01:41:39,094
It's a ticking time bomb,
and we're the ones that lit the fuse.

1096
01:41:39,193 --> 01:41:42,037
We still have 58 days
to try and change things.

1097
01:41:42,096 --> 01:41:44,599
But nothing will work
as long as that thing is still on.

1098
01:41:44,699 --> 01:41:45,939
Young lady, I'm gonna assume

1099
01:41:46,033 --> 01:41:48,639
that your knowledge
of tachyonic fusion is a little sketchy.

1100
01:41:48,736 --> 01:41:53,549
Shutting it down is impossible.
There is no off.

1101
01:41:54,542 --> 01:41:56,783
I'm telling you what it's doing.

1102
01:41:56,877 --> 01:41:58,618
Why don't you care?

1103
01:41:59,447 --> 01:42:00,983
Because he's the one that's doing it.

1104
01:42:07,622 --> 01:42:08,896
Right?

1105
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:14,000
Let's imagine.

1106
01:42:15,730 --> 01:42:19,974
If you glimpsed the future
and were frightened by what you <i>saw,</i>

1107
01:42:20,067 --> 01:42:23,241
what would you do
with that information? You would go to...

1108
01:42:23,904 --> 01:42:26,510
Who? Politicians?
Captains of industry?

1109
01:42:26,741 --> 01:42:29,915
And how would you convince them?
With data? Facts?

1110
01:42:30,778 --> 01:42:31,916
Good luck.

1111
01:42:32,013 --> 01:42:33,788
The only facts they won't challenge

1112
01:42:33,848 --> 01:42:37,489
are the ones that keep the wheels
greased and the dollars rolling in.

1113
01:42:37,585 --> 01:42:39,189
But what if...

1114
01:42:39,286 --> 01:42:42,267
What if there was a way
of skipping the middleman

1115
01:42:42,323 --> 01:42:45,702
and putting the critical news
directly into everyone's head?

1116
01:42:47,194 --> 01:42:51,006
The probability of
widespread annihilation kept going up.

1117
01:42:51,098 --> 01:42:54,272
The only way to stop it was to show it.

1118
01:42:54,669 --> 01:42:56,171
To scare people straight.

1119
01:42:56,270 --> 01:42:59,774
Because what reasonable
human being wouldn't be galvanized

1120
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,080
by the potential destruction of

1121
01:43:01,108 --> 01:43:02,849
everything they have
ever known or loved?

1122
01:43:04,845 --> 01:43:09,453
To save civilization,
I would show its collapse.

1123
01:43:11,052 --> 01:43:13,532
But how do you think
this vision was received?

1124
01:43:14,121 --> 01:43:17,967
How do you think people responded
to the prospect of imminent doom?

1125
01:43:18,059 --> 01:43:21,233
They gobbled it up,
like a chocolate éclair.

1126
01:43:22,163 --> 01:43:24,803
They didn't fear their demise,
they repackaged it.

1127
01:43:25,833 --> 01:43:29,872
It can be enjoyed as video games,
as TV shows, books, movies.

1128
01:43:29,970 --> 01:43:33,543
The entire world wholeheartedly
embraced the apocalypse

1129
01:43:33,641 --> 01:43:36,019
and sprinted towards it
with gleeful abandon.

1130
01:43:36,577 --> 01:43:40,218
Meanwhile, your Earth
was crumbling all around you.

1131
01:43:40,314 --> 01:43:43,989
You've got simultaneous
epidemics of obesity and starvation.

1132
01:43:44,051 --> 01:43:45,086
Explain that one.

1133
01:43:46,353 --> 01:43:49,334
Bees and butterflies start to disappear.

1134
01:43:49,390 --> 01:43:50,994
The glaciers melt.

1135
01:43:51,058 --> 01:43:54,062
Algae blooms all around you.

1136
01:43:54,161 --> 01:43:56,107
The coal mine canaries
are dropping dead.

1137
01:43:56,197 --> 01:43:58,905
And you won't take the hint!

1138
01:43:59,767 --> 01:44:03,613
In every moment, there is the
possibility of a better future.

1139
01:44:03,704 --> 01:44:05,445
But you people won't believe it.

1140
01:44:05,539 --> 01:44:06,677
And because you won't believe it,

1141
01:44:06,741 --> 01:44:09,745
you won't do what is necessary
to make it a reality.

1142
01:44:09,844 --> 01:44:13,883
So you dwell on this terrible future,
and you resign yourselves lo it.

1143
01:44:13,948 --> 01:44:14,926
<i>For one reason,</i>

1144
01:44:15,015 --> 01:44:19,259
because that future doesn't
ask anything of you today.

1145
01:44:21,689 --> 01:44:25,933
So, yes, we saw the iceberg,
we warned the Titanic.

1146
01:44:27,428 --> 01:44:30,807
But you all just steered for it anyway,
full steam ahead.

1147
01:44:30,898 --> 01:44:31,968
Why?

1148
01:44:33,367 --> 01:44:35,369
Because you want to sink.

1149
01:44:37,037 --> 01:44:38,539
You gave up.

1150
01:44:40,541 --> 01:44:43,750
That's not The Monitor's fault.
That's yours.

1151
01:44:47,915 --> 01:44:49,053
Put them through.

1152
01:44:53,287 --> 01:44:55,062
Thanks for visiting, Frank.

1153
01:44:56,290 --> 01:44:58,668
It was genuinely nice to see you again.

1154
01:45:08,736 --> 01:45:10,511
- What are you doing?
- Not giving up.

1155
01:45:27,755 --> 01:45:28,790
Look out!

1156
01:45:34,428 --> 01:45:36,374
- Get the thing!
- What thing?

1157
01:45:36,463 --> 01:45:39,205
The thing I gave you
when we first got here!

1158
01:45:41,202 --> 01:45:43,307
Arm it! Get on the platform!

1159
01:45:50,311 --> 01:45:52,655
Casey! The bomb!

1160
01:45:52,980 --> 01:45:54,823
Get on the platform!

1161
01:46:13,901 --> 01:46:15,505
- Now what?
- Arm it!

1162
01:46:15,569 --> 01:46:16,809
How?

1163
01:47:43,791 --> 01:47:45,065
Casey!

1164
01:47:49,430 --> 01:47:52,070
The bomb! Where is the bomb?

1165
01:48:13,253 --> 01:48:15,597
<i>One minute to detonation.</i>

1166
01:48:19,693 --> 01:48:21,001
<i>45 seconds.</i>

1167
01:48:21,095 --> 01:48:24,133
Athena! The bomb.
What do I do? How do I turn it off?

1168
01:48:24,198 --> 01:48:25,506
<i>30 seconds.</i>

1169
01:48:25,599 --> 01:48:26,942
You can't.

1170
01:48:30,604 --> 01:48:32,550
This is not funny!

1171
01:48:35,943 --> 01:48:38,514
Frank, get out of there! It's gonna blow!

1172
01:48:38,612 --> 01:48:40,956
Frank, get out!

1173
01:48:43,851 --> 01:48:45,023
Get out of there!

1174
01:48:45,119 --> 01:48:47,827
<i>- Four. Three.</i>
- Close the portal!

1175
01:48:47,888 --> 01:48:49,561
- Two. One.
- Close the portal!

1176
01:49:19,420 --> 01:49:21,866
- Are you all right?
- The bomb's gone.

1177
01:49:21,922 --> 01:49:23,060
- Can you stand?
- Yeah.

1178
01:49:23,157 --> 01:49:24,329
Frank!

1179
01:49:28,562 --> 01:49:29,563
No.

1180
01:49:31,398 --> 01:49:33,207
The bomb's gone.

1181
01:49:33,267 --> 01:49:35,008
- Can you stand?
- Yeah.

1182
01:49:35,102 --> 01:49:36,172
Frank!

1183
01:49:50,684 --> 01:49:53,130
- What happened? Is she okay?
- I need to get her to a repair module.

1184
01:49:53,220 --> 01:49:56,292
Frank! No one's going to repair me.

1185
01:49:57,191 --> 01:49:58,465
Not in time.

1186
01:49:59,193 --> 01:50:01,298
I need to tell you something now.

1187
01:50:08,802 --> 01:50:09,940
Darn.

1188
01:50:11,071 --> 01:50:12,641
I'm shutting down.

1189
01:50:12,739 --> 01:50:15,219
<i>I'm shutting down.</i>

1190
01:50:17,478 --> 01:50:18,957
I'm going to lose sync.

1191
01:50:20,414 --> 01:50:22,087
Don't look at me like that.

1192
01:50:22,249 --> 01:50:27,494
- If I lose sync, it's not failure.
- I know.

1193
01:50:29,490 --> 01:50:32,266
There are things
I need to tell you before the final...

1194
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:36,166
Before the automated program kicks in.

1195
01:50:37,064 --> 01:50:38,634
I'm a machine.

1196
01:50:39,233 --> 01:50:41,509
I never thought that was bad

1197
01:50:41,602 --> 01:50:43,809
until I saw your face
when you found out I was.

1198
01:50:43,904 --> 01:50:45,144
I always knew.

1199
01:50:46,607 --> 01:50:47,847
No, you didn't.

1200
01:50:48,408 --> 01:50:49,751

a manner that is difficult to recognize.</i>

1204
01:51:05,092 --> 01:51:08,266
<i>It seems imperative to explain to him
that I am an Audio-Animatronic...</i>

1205

Athena...

1206
01:51:10,030 --> 01:51:13,534
<i>But I am concerned
that he may be adversely affected</i>

1207
01:51:13,634 --> 01:51:15,875
<i>when he finds out that I am not human.</i>

1208
01:51:17,037 --> 01:51:18,607
<i>He has potential.</i>

1209
01:51:18,772 --> 01:51:20,376
<i>I don't want to damage it.</i>

1210
01:51:20,974 --> 01:51:23,511
<i>He needs someone to believe in him.</i>

1211
01:51:23,610 --> 01:51:25,783
<i>And I am fulfilling that need.</i>

1212

<i>I'm having unusual thoughts
towards Frank Walker.</i>

1215
01:51:39,126 --> 01:51:42,232
<i>I suspect a ﬂaw
in my empathy interface.</i>

1216
01:51:42,329 --> 01:51:44,673
<i>I am thinking I should report it.</i>

1217

1218

<i>Frank Walker has been banished

1221
01:51:59,646 --> 01:52:01,319
<i>He says he has lost hope</i>

1222
01:52:01,415 --> 01:52:05,158
<i>and he holds me responsible for
having given it to him in the first place.</i>

1223
01:52:05,652 --> 01:52:07,359
<i>I do not understand this.</i>

1224

<i>He says I never wilt</i>

1225

<i>because I do not feel

I was designed to find dreamers.

1229
01:52:28,508 --> 01:52:29,885
I found you.

1230
01:52:33,447 --> 01:52:34,926
And lost you.

1231
01:52:36,850 --> 01:52:38,193
Till I found her.

1232
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:40,926
Casey.

1233
01:52:43,890 --> 01:52:47,030
Dreamers need to stick together.

1234
01:52:50,230 --> 01:52:51,732
It's not programming.

1235
01:52:52,866 --> 01:52:54,209
It's personal.

1236
01:53:01,875 --> 01:53:03,115
The Monitor.

1237
01:53:03,210 --> 01:53:06,885
The bomb is gone. But I'm not, yet.

1238

1240
01:53:12,219 --> 01:53:14,631
You know what to do, Frank.

1241
01:53:15,255 --> 01:53:17,895
Help get it right this time.

1242
01:53:21,228 --> 01:53:22,969
I thought you can't have ideas.

1243
01:53:23,730 --> 01:53:26,301
Well, what do you know?

1244
01:53:29,303 --> 01:53:30,782
What do you know?

1245
01:53:33,907 --> 01:53:35,580
Systems failing.

1246
01:54:17,551 --> 01:54:19,462
- Frank?
- Yeah?

1247
01:54:20,887 --> 01:54:23,800
Do you want to know
why you could never make me laugh?

1248
01:54:26,126 --> 01:54:27,298
Why?

1249
01:54:28,829 --> 01:54:30,570
Because you're not funny.

1250
01:54:43,076 --> 01:54:44,919
You can let me go now.

1251
01:54:52,152 --> 01:54:53,495
Goodbye, Frank.

1252
01:55:02,396 --> 01:55:03,841
Goodbye, Athena.

1253
01:55:34,127 --> 01:55:35,367
Bollocks.

1254
01:56:26,746 --> 01:56:27,747
Now what?

1255
01:56:29,850 --> 01:56:31,488
You're asking me?

1256
01:56:32,085 --> 01:56:33,860
This was your idea, kid.

1257
01:56:36,089 --> 01:56:37,159
Yeah.

1258
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:41,696
You think it will work?

1259
01:56:43,930 --> 01:56:46,274
I guess we have to make it work.

1260
01:57:01,781 --> 01:57:03,624
<i>So, we're making it work.</i>

1261
01:57:04,651 --> 01:57:06,392
<i>First order of business,</i>

1262
01:57:07,387 --> 01:57:08,866
<i>get the door back open.</i>

1263
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:17,703
<i>Couldn't hurt to get a few
experienced engineers over here.</i>

1264
01:57:21,968 --> 01:57:23,072
Next...

1265
01:57:23,403 --> 01:57:25,815
<i>Put the party back on.</i>

1266
01:57:28,008 --> 01:57:30,579
<i>And print out some new invitations.</i>

1267
01:57:32,812 --> 01:57:35,554
<i>Which brings us to
why we're here today.</i>

1268
01:57:36,316 --> 01:57:39,229
A year ago, it was
all supposed to be over.

1269
01:57:39,319 --> 01:57:40,730
We shouldn't even be here.

1270
01:57:41,488 --> 01:57:42,831
But we are.

1271
01:57:44,190 --> 01:57:47,728
It isn't hard to knock down
a big, evil building

1272
01:57:47,827 --> 01:57:50,501
that's telling everybody
that the world's gonna end.

1273
01:57:51,665 --> 01:57:53,201
What is hard

1274
01:57:54,501 --> 01:57:57,107
is figuring out what to build in its place.

1275
01:57:58,171 --> 01:58:01,778
And if we're gonna do that,
we can't do it alone.

1276
01:58:03,009 --> 01:58:04,682
We're gonna need all of you.

1277

- Frank Walker, may I ask a question?
- Sure.

1278
01:58:10,350 --> 01:58:14,196
The search parameters you've given us,
while mathematically sound,

1279
01:58:14,254 --> 01:58:17,531
are a bit undefined.

1280
01:58:18,558 --> 01:58:20,435
Could you be more specific, please?

1281
01:58:21,194 --> 01:58:22,696
Well, Miss Newton,

1282
01:58:23,630 --> 01:58:26,736
you wanna tell our new recruiters
what they're looking for?

1283
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:28,211
Dreamers.

1284
01:58:28,702 --> 01:58:31,979
We are looking for dreamers.

1285
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:35,951
Anyone who will feed the right wolf.

1286
01:58:46,753 --> 01:58:50,428
So, I once told your predecessor

1287
01:58:51,057 --> 01:58:54,903
that she was nothing
but a combination of ones and zeroes.

1288
01:58:58,665 --> 01:58:59,735
I was wrong.

1289
01:59:00,433 --> 01:59:02,071
She was much more than that.

1290
01:59:02,802 --> 01:59:05,078
You are much more than that, too.

1291
01:59:05,605 --> 01:59:08,745
So, go out there
and do what she would have done.

1292
01:59:09,943 --> 01:59:12,014
Find the ones who haven't given up.

1293
01:59:13,079 --> 01:59:14,285
They're the future.

1293
02:09:38,689 --> 02:09:41,995
