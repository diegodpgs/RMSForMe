1
00:00:21,292 --> 00:00:23,852
Friends, let me introduce myself.

2
00:00:24,172 --> 00:00:26,322
Peltzer's the name.
Rand Peltzer.

3
00:00:26,892 --> 00:00:28,644
That's me there on the corner.

4
00:00:29,252 --> 00:00:30,571
I'm an inventor.

5
00:00:30,852 --> 00:00:32,808
And I have a story to tell.

6
00:00:33,172 --> 00:00:35,527
I know.
Who hasn't got a story?

7
00:00:35,772 --> 00:00:38,491
Well, nobody's got a story
like this one.

8
00:00:38,692 --> 00:00:40,284
Nobody.

9
00:00:40,572 --> 00:00:42,927
It all started here in Chinatown.

10
00:00:43,332 --> 00:00:45,800
I was trying
to move a little merchandise...

11
00:00:46,052 --> 00:00:48,282
...maybe find a present
for my kid.

12
00:00:48,572 --> 00:00:50,563
I tried this one place.

13
00:00:55,052 --> 00:00:55,848
Wait a minute.

14
00:00:57,572 --> 00:00:58,687
What's down here?

15
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,041
This is it.

16
00:01:00,332 --> 00:01:02,562
This is your grandfather's store?

17
00:01:03,572 --> 00:01:04,766
Come on.

18
00:01:06,292 --> 00:01:09,090
No wonder you gotta drag
people in off the street.

19
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,648
Go ahead, mister.
Look around.

20
00:01:16,852 --> 00:01:18,888
See if there's something you like.

21
00:01:37,892 --> 00:01:38,961
Are these things real?

22
00:01:39,172 --> 00:01:41,686
I told you. Everything's real.

23
00:01:44,052 --> 00:01:46,282
You do have
interesting artifacts here...

24
00:01:46,532 --> 00:01:48,284
...but there's one thing
you don't have.

25
00:01:48,532 --> 00:01:49,601
And what's that?

26
00:01:50,012 --> 00:01:53,129
Let me show you.
I'm an inventor. I made this.

27
00:01:53,732 --> 00:01:56,769
The Bathroom Buddy.
The invention of the century.

28
00:01:57,012 --> 00:02:01,130
It eliminates the need to carry
heavy luggage when you travel.

29
00:02:01,452 --> 00:02:04,205
You got yourself
your shaving mirror...

30
00:02:04,412 --> 00:02:08,325
...your toothbrush, a toothpick.
You got toenail clippers...

31
00:02:09,292 --> 00:02:10,361
...a nail file...

32
00:02:10,692 --> 00:02:13,081
...and you got yourself
a dental mirror.

33
00:02:13,292 --> 00:02:15,362
This is gonna revolutionize traveling.

34
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:18,320
Let's just say,
for the sake of argument...

35
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:20,802
...that you're on a bus,
a plane or a train.

36
00:02:21,492 --> 00:02:24,052
You forgot to brush your teeth.

37
00:02:24,692 --> 00:02:28,002
You got yourself a bad case
of dragon breath.

38
00:02:29,572 --> 00:02:30,971
Bad breath.

39
00:02:31,172 --> 00:02:32,002
What do you do?

40
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,166
No problem, friend.
All you do is...

41
00:02:35,412 --> 00:02:37,004
...you take your toothbrush out...

42
00:02:37,372 --> 00:02:38,885
...and you push this button.

43
00:02:40,332 --> 00:02:42,084
That's absolutely no problem.

44
00:02:42,772 --> 00:02:44,728
Cleans up easily.

45
00:02:44,972 --> 00:02:47,691
What I'd like to do, sir,
is give you my card.

46
00:02:47,972 --> 00:02:51,089
Rand Peltzer. "Fantastic Ideas
for a Fantastic World."

47
00:02:51,292 --> 00:02:52,725
I make the illogical logical.

48
00:02:53,572 --> 00:02:55,210
I can get you these.

49
00:02:55,492 --> 00:02:57,687
I can get them by the dozen
if you'd like.

50
00:03:01,532 --> 00:03:02,885
What do you think?

51
00:03:04,732 --> 00:03:05,926
What do you think?

52
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:10,730
Where's that coming from?

53
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,088
What is that?

54
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:31,441
Mogwai.

55
00:03:34,652 --> 00:03:35,687
What's he doing?

56
00:03:35,972 --> 00:03:37,087
Singing.

57
00:03:37,772 --> 00:03:39,888
He does that sometimes.

58
00:03:45,612 --> 00:03:48,046
I gotta have him.
He's incredible.

59
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:50,240
Tell you what I'll do.

60
00:03:50,492 --> 00:03:52,369
I'll give you $100 for him.

61
00:03:53,652 --> 00:03:56,644
I've gotta have him. It's a present
for my son for Christmas.

62
00:03:56,852 --> 00:03:58,524
It's what I've been looking for.

63
00:03:58,732 --> 00:04:01,121
I've been everywhere.
I'll give you $200.

64
00:04:01,452 --> 00:04:02,805
That's $200!

65
00:04:03,172 --> 00:04:04,366
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:04,732 --> 00:04:07,485
Mogwai not for sale.

67
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:10,922
You said everything here was for sale.

68
00:04:11,132 --> 00:04:12,087
Grandfather!

69
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:15,887
With mogwai comes much responsibility.

70
00:04:16,092 --> 00:04:19,289
I cannot sell him at any price.

71
00:04:24,892 --> 00:04:27,565
Wait outside. I'll be right out.

72
00:04:27,772 --> 00:04:29,091
Just go.

73
00:04:38,572 --> 00:04:41,086
Okay, mister. Here it is.

74
00:04:42,172 --> 00:04:43,366
What about your grandfather?

75
00:04:43,572 --> 00:04:46,245
Forget what he said. He's crazy.
We need the money.

76
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,885
Do you want it or not?

77
00:04:48,092 --> 00:04:49,286
I want it.

78
00:04:50,972 --> 00:04:53,532
There's three rules
you've gotta follow.

79
00:04:53,772 --> 00:04:55,091
What kind of rules?

80
00:04:55,372 --> 00:04:56,691
Keep him out of the light.

81
00:04:56,892 --> 00:04:59,690
He hates bright light,
especially sunlight.

82
00:04:59,892 --> 00:05:01,041
It'll kill him.

83
00:05:01,252 --> 00:05:04,688
And keep him away from water.
Don 't get him wet.

84
00:05:04,892 --> 00:05:08,521
But the most important rule,
the rule you can never forget...

85
00:05:08,732 --> 00:05:11,849
...no matter how much he cries
or how much he begs...

86
00:05:12,092 --> 00:05:15,767
...never, never feed him
after midnight. Got it?

87
00:05:15,972 --> 00:05:17,291
Sure. Whatever you say.

88
00:05:17,492 --> 00:05:20,165
Thanks.
And have a Merry Christmas.

89
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:30,331
You're rolling with
Rockin' Ricky Rialto...

90
00:05:30,572 --> 00:05:33,245
...the voice of Kingston Falls, U.S.A.!

91
00:06:05,372 --> 00:06:06,691
Alex...

92
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:08,730
Getting close to Christmas.

93
00:06:08,972 --> 00:06:11,167
You'll get stuck
with a lot of trees again.

94
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,324
I thought I'd be seeing you
about this time.

95
00:06:14,532 --> 00:06:15,851
What the hell is this?

96
00:06:16,772 --> 00:06:18,410
What are you doing in there?

97
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:20,125
Don't ask.

98
00:06:20,372 --> 00:06:22,522
Alex, I came to get my tree.

99
00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:25,451
Pete, take that tree
to Mr. Anderson's truck.

100
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:28,526
What do you say, Alex?

101
00:06:28,772 --> 00:06:30,763
You can spare one
for the sheriff's station.

102
00:06:30,972 --> 00:06:33,406
I paid for mine, Frank.

103
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,130
Billy, you need a jump?

104
00:07:21,532 --> 00:07:24,490
No, thanks, Mr. Futterman.
I'm late for work as it is.

105
00:07:24,732 --> 00:07:27,451
These goddamn foreign cars
always freeze up on you.

106
00:07:27,772 --> 00:07:30,730
You don't find American
machinery doing that.

107
00:07:31,012 --> 00:07:32,081
See that plow?

108
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,761
Hasn't given me a day's trouble
in 15 years.

109
00:07:34,972 --> 00:07:36,610
You know why?
Kentucky Harvester.

110
00:07:36,892 --> 00:07:40,805
It ain't some foreign piece of crap.
That's a Kentucky Harvester.

111
00:07:41,292 --> 00:07:44,170
If I wanna keep my job,
I should be going now.

112
00:07:44,372 --> 00:07:46,044
How's your comic strip coming?

113
00:07:46,492 --> 00:07:50,167
I expect to see you in the funnies
with "Smilin' Jack," "Li'I Abner."

114
00:07:50,372 --> 00:07:52,567
They don't run those comics anymore.

115
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:53,966
They don't?

116
00:07:54,372 --> 00:07:55,885
Come on, Barn.

117
00:07:56,372 --> 00:07:58,488
Say hello to your wife, okay?

118
00:07:58,692 --> 00:08:00,091
So long, Billy.

119
00:08:04,052 --> 00:08:06,282
Goddamn foreign cars.

120
00:08:29,932 --> 00:08:30,728
Hey, doctor.

121
00:08:30,932 --> 00:08:32,285
Morning, Billy.

122
00:09:05,492 --> 00:09:07,881
Get in there and be quiet.

123
00:09:25,372 --> 00:09:27,886
- You just made it.
- Again.

124
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:29,965
Will you sign this petition?

125
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:31,969
Sure. What's it for?

126
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:34,128
To declare Dorry's pub a landmark.

127
00:09:34,372 --> 00:09:36,681
Mrs. Deagle's trying to take
his lease away.

128
00:09:36,972 --> 00:09:37,882
His too?

129
00:09:38,092 --> 00:09:41,243
Yeah, she says it's a dive,
a public nuisance.

130
00:09:41,452 --> 00:09:43,363
That's where my dad
proposed to my mom.

131
00:09:43,572 --> 00:09:47,087
That's where everybody's dad
proposed to their mom. Cross your "T."

132
00:09:51,212 --> 00:09:52,201
Thanks.

133
00:09:59,492 --> 00:10:00,925
Good morning, Mrs. Deagle.

134
00:10:01,132 --> 00:10:02,690
What's good about it?

135
00:10:05,932 --> 00:10:07,126
Klutz!

136
00:10:09,772 --> 00:10:11,364
Watch it, watch it!

137
00:10:11,852 --> 00:10:14,571
40, 60, 80...

138
00:10:21,252 --> 00:10:23,607
200. Thank you.

139
00:10:24,052 --> 00:10:25,280
- Mrs. Deagle?
- What?

140
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:28,325
I just wanted you to know
that Joe got another job.

141
00:10:28,572 --> 00:10:29,800
My husband, Joe Harris.

142
00:10:30,012 --> 00:10:31,684
And I've taken up some sewing.

143
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:33,604
What are you trying to tell me?

144
00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:36,692
Neither of us will be paid
for two weeks.

145
00:10:36,892 --> 00:10:38,769
Couldn't you get Mr. Corben...

146
00:10:39,252 --> 00:10:41,049
...to give us a little more time?

147
00:10:41,252 --> 00:10:42,128
Mrs. Harris...

148
00:10:42,532 --> 00:10:44,727
...the bank and I have
the same purpose in life:

149
00:10:44,972 --> 00:10:46,769
To make money.

150
00:10:46,972 --> 00:10:48,564
Not to support a lot of...

151
00:10:48,772 --> 00:10:49,887
...deadbeats.

152
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:53,681
Mrs. Deagle, it's Christmas!

153
00:10:57,292 --> 00:11:00,489
Now you know what to ask Santa for,
don't you?

154
00:11:02,652 --> 00:11:04,210
Mommy, I'm hungry.

155
00:11:04,572 --> 00:11:06,722
Yes, honey. So am I.

156
00:11:12,252 --> 00:11:15,005
This is what's left
of my imported Bavarian snowman.

157
00:11:15,252 --> 00:11:17,891
Your dog broke it this morning!

158
00:11:19,452 --> 00:11:20,680
I'm terribly sorry.

159
00:11:20,892 --> 00:11:22,371
Tell me how much I owe you--

160
00:11:22,572 --> 00:11:24,085
I don't want money.

161
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,968
I want your dog.

162
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:33,086
Barney?

163
00:11:33,772 --> 00:11:35,763
Give him to me.

164
00:11:35,972 --> 00:11:38,964
I'll take him to the kennel.
They'll put him to sleep.

165
00:11:39,172 --> 00:11:42,323
It'll be quick and painless,
compared to what I could do to him.

166
00:11:43,092 --> 00:11:44,411
What could you do?

167
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:49,932
I'll catch the beast myself.

168
00:11:50,932 --> 00:11:52,923
Then he'll get what he deserves.

169
00:11:53,132 --> 00:11:55,566
A slow, painful death.

170
00:11:56,652 --> 00:12:00,122
Maybe I'll put him in my spin dryer
on high heat.

171
00:12:01,292 --> 00:12:02,407
That'd do it.

172
00:12:09,972 --> 00:12:11,849
Barney, will you get off of her?

173
00:12:12,052 --> 00:12:14,520
My dear lady, are you all right?

174
00:12:14,732 --> 00:12:17,849
I have a very weak heart.
I can't stand a shock like that!

175
00:12:18,052 --> 00:12:19,929
What is that dog doing in here?

176
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,764
This is a bank, not a pet store.

177
00:12:21,972 --> 00:12:22,927
Very good, Gerald.

178
00:12:23,132 --> 00:12:24,360
He wouldn't hurt you.

179
00:12:24,572 --> 00:12:27,370
Excuses, excuses.
You're just like your father.

180
00:12:27,652 --> 00:12:31,691
I've listened to his excuses
for 10 years, the loser!

181
00:12:31,892 --> 00:12:34,690
As for you, you mangy cur...

182
00:12:35,052 --> 00:12:36,644
...I'll get you...

183
00:12:37,492 --> 00:12:39,289
...when you least expect it!

184
00:12:39,732 --> 00:12:41,085
Oh, my heart!

185
00:12:41,332 --> 00:12:44,085
I must apologize
for this most unusual...

186
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:45,884
You putz.

187
00:12:49,932 --> 00:12:51,729
The old bat never looked better.

188
00:12:52,132 --> 00:12:53,770
It's great. You're doing fine.

189
00:12:54,372 --> 00:12:55,521
Thanks.

190
00:12:55,852 --> 00:12:57,331
Hello, Gerald.

191
00:12:57,572 --> 00:13:00,484
If it isn't Captain Clip-on.

192
00:13:00,732 --> 00:13:03,963
Guess who almost applied
for unemployment today?

193
00:13:04,172 --> 00:13:06,367
- I give up.
- You.

194
00:13:06,572 --> 00:13:09,291
But Mr. Corben had second thoughts.

195
00:13:09,732 --> 00:13:12,041
He gets so sentimental
about the holidays.

196
00:13:12,252 --> 00:13:13,890
Imagine that.

197
00:13:14,572 --> 00:13:16,483
I would've fired you in a second.

198
00:13:17,132 --> 00:13:18,884
Merry Christmas to you too.

199
00:13:19,092 --> 00:13:20,889
Excuse me, Mr. Jones.

200
00:13:22,492 --> 00:13:24,084
Hey, Peltzer.

201
00:13:24,292 --> 00:13:27,284
Look, I'm a junior
vice president at 23.

202
00:13:27,492 --> 00:13:30,723
By the time I'm 25,
I'm gonna have Mr. Corben's job.

203
00:13:31,172 --> 00:13:33,208
By the time I'm 30,
I'll be a millionaire.

204
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:34,208
Look at you.

205
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:37,971
You're practically supporting
your whole family.

206
00:13:38,532 --> 00:13:40,124
The world's changing.

207
00:13:40,332 --> 00:13:42,687
You gotta change with it.
You gotta be tough.

208
00:13:43,092 --> 00:13:45,970
Tough? And no one's
tougher than you, Ger?

209
00:13:47,372 --> 00:13:49,488
Don't call me that.
My name's Gerald.

210
00:13:49,692 --> 00:13:50,920
Can I get you a drink?

211
00:13:51,132 --> 00:13:53,441
Give me a vodka martini.
Shake, don't stir.

212
00:13:53,652 --> 00:13:54,641
You work here?

213
00:13:54,852 --> 00:13:57,320
Weeknights, so Dorry doesn't
have to pay an extra waitress.

214
00:13:57,532 --> 00:13:58,362
That's great.

215
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:01,769
Yeah, that's swell, if you
like working for nothing.

216
00:14:01,972 --> 00:14:05,089
Two more rounds for the pool table,
on the house.

217
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,970
You haven't seen my new apartment.

218
00:14:08,172 --> 00:14:09,924
I haven't seen your old apartment.

219
00:14:10,692 --> 00:14:14,287
We're talking cable.
Can we have dinner tomorrow night?

220
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,091
I'm working.

221
00:14:18,052 --> 00:14:21,328
Why don't you tell Dorry you're sick?
He can't dock your pay.

222
00:14:30,132 --> 00:14:31,565
Billy, is that you?

223
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:33,251
Yeah, Mom. It's me.

224
00:14:33,452 --> 00:14:35,329
I'm in the kitchen.

225
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:38,924
Merry Christmas!

226
00:14:42,372 --> 00:14:44,806
Merry Christmas, movie house!

227
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:47,402
Merry Christmas, emporium!

228
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:50,087
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie.

229
00:14:50,452 --> 00:14:51,885
Do you need any help?

230
00:14:52,372 --> 00:14:54,169
Yeah, you could do the eggs.

231
00:14:54,652 --> 00:14:55,880
Thanks.

232
00:15:20,572 --> 00:15:24,451
Dad's machines work so well
the first couple of weeks, then...

233
00:15:24,652 --> 00:15:26,085
Use the sink.

234
00:15:31,492 --> 00:15:33,084
Is something wrong?

235
00:15:33,972 --> 00:15:36,088
No, it's a sad movie.

236
00:15:39,532 --> 00:15:40,851
How was your day?

237
00:15:41,052 --> 00:15:42,280
It was fine.

238
00:15:44,932 --> 00:15:47,048
Come on, what is it?
What's wrong?

239
00:15:47,852 --> 00:15:50,889
Mrs. Deagle called again
this afternoon.

240
00:15:55,132 --> 00:15:58,124
Let's not talk about it now.
Don't say anything to Dad.

241
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,526
Fine with me.

242
00:16:00,172 --> 00:16:03,209
Don we now our gay apparel

243
00:16:06,372 --> 00:16:07,964
Hi, sweetheart!

244
00:16:10,332 --> 00:16:12,607
- Welcome home.
- Hey, Dad.

245
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:16,281
I'm glad you're back.
How was the trip?

246
00:16:16,492 --> 00:16:17,322
It was great.

247
00:16:17,572 --> 00:16:20,166
The Miracle Company, who has
the Kitchen Companion...

248
00:16:20,372 --> 00:16:23,125
...might be interested
in the Bathroom Buddy.

249
00:16:23,332 --> 00:16:24,685
Great!

250
00:16:27,572 --> 00:16:29,051
- Thanks!
- You'll like this.

251
00:16:29,892 --> 00:16:31,484
What is it? A birdcage?

252
00:16:32,052 --> 00:16:35,362
No, don't shake it. Open it now.
It won't wait till Christmas.

253
00:16:38,492 --> 00:16:39,720
It's a puppy, isn't it?

254
00:16:40,372 --> 00:16:41,487
Yeah, I can tell.

255
00:16:41,692 --> 00:16:43,091
It's a new car.

256
00:16:48,972 --> 00:16:51,532
- Honey, would you dim the lights?
- Sure.

257
00:16:51,772 --> 00:16:54,047
Dim the lights?
Does it glow in the dark?

258
00:16:54,252 --> 00:16:56,641
It's important. Trust me.

259
00:16:57,932 --> 00:16:59,490
Go ahead, open it.

260
00:17:20,892 --> 00:17:22,120
What is it?

261
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,845
It's your new pet.

262
00:17:24,052 --> 00:17:25,883
Come on, Barney.
Be a good dog.

263
00:17:35,372 --> 00:17:37,090
You're kidding.

264
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,689
Dad, it's really neat.

265
00:17:44,612 --> 00:17:45,647
Where'd you get this?

266
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:48,241
Some little junk store in Chinatown.

267
00:17:48,452 --> 00:17:49,328
Can I pick him up?

268
00:17:49,532 --> 00:17:51,363
Sure, go ahead. Just be careful.

269
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:53,051
- You gotta be gentle.
- I will.

270
00:17:54,172 --> 00:17:55,810
I hope he's housebroken.

271
00:17:57,972 --> 00:17:59,485
Isn't he cute?

272
00:18:00,932 --> 00:18:01,967
Has it got a name?

273
00:18:02,172 --> 00:18:03,366
Mogwai.

274
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:08,606
Some Chinese word.
I just call him...

275
00:18:08,812 --> 00:18:11,280
...Gizmo.
He seems to like it.

276
00:18:15,652 --> 00:18:17,085
Look up here a minute.

277
00:18:18,172 --> 00:18:20,128
We're getting our picture taken.

278
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:21,287
Smile.

279
00:18:21,532 --> 00:18:22,647
Ready?

280
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:25,412
One, two, three...

281
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:27,926
Bright light!

282
00:18:28,132 --> 00:18:29,201
What happened?

283
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:31,084
He hates bright lights.

284
00:18:31,852 --> 00:18:34,571
There's some important things
I forgot to tell you.

285
00:18:34,772 --> 00:18:39,687
Number one, he hates bright lights.
You gotta keep him out of the sunlight.

286
00:18:40,372 --> 00:18:41,885
Sunlight will kill him.

287
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:44,647
Number two, keep him
away from water.

288
00:18:44,892 --> 00:18:49,727
Don't give him any water to drink.
Whatever you do, don't give him a bath.

289
00:18:49,972 --> 00:18:52,167
And the most important thing...

290
00:18:52,372 --> 00:18:56,081
...don't ever feed him
after midnight.

291
00:20:09,172 --> 00:20:10,525
Looks like you hurt yourself.

292
00:20:12,692 --> 00:20:14,489
Light bright! Light bright!

293
00:20:17,772 --> 00:20:21,685
Just sit down there
and don't fall off, okay?

294
00:20:21,892 --> 00:20:24,087
I'll get you fixed up in no time.

295
00:20:26,732 --> 00:20:28,290
All right.

296
00:20:29,252 --> 00:20:30,480
Hold still.

297
00:20:31,452 --> 00:20:33,682
Sorry. Sorry.

298
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,881
Try not to move so much, okay?

299
00:21:00,172 --> 00:21:02,481
Good night, Giz.
I'll see you in the morning.

300
00:21:58,572 --> 00:22:00,005
I got a tree!

301
00:22:00,972 --> 00:22:02,690
Oh, Christ!

302
00:22:04,332 --> 00:22:06,004
Billy!

303
00:22:10,772 --> 00:22:13,286
I just brought in
your Christmas tree.

304
00:22:13,492 --> 00:22:14,971
What happened?

305
00:22:15,172 --> 00:22:18,130
Slight problem
with the Peltzer Peeler-Juicer.

306
00:22:18,332 --> 00:22:20,687
I thought your dad fixed it.

307
00:22:20,892 --> 00:22:22,484
I thought so too.

308
00:22:24,332 --> 00:22:27,881
You should just buy orange juice
in cartons. It's a lot easier.

309
00:22:29,052 --> 00:22:30,883
See, it works.

310
00:22:35,572 --> 00:22:37,961
- I had to come.
- So I see.

311
00:22:38,172 --> 00:22:40,049
Now I can see. It takes...

312
00:22:40,252 --> 00:22:41,731
...a certain kind of guy.

313
00:22:41,932 --> 00:22:44,685
And that guy needs
a certain kind of dame.

314
00:23:04,732 --> 00:23:06,802
It's no problem, Pete.
Leave it up here.

315
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,121
What'll you tell him?

316
00:23:08,372 --> 00:23:12,160
I'll just tell him a bunch of bikers
stole it from me on my way home.

317
00:23:15,372 --> 00:23:18,091
Wow! The Hooded Menace.
Issue number one!

318
00:23:18,292 --> 00:23:19,520
Pretty neat, huh?

319
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,085
Where'd you get it?

320
00:23:21,772 --> 00:23:23,683
Dr. Fantasy's, I think.

321
00:23:25,132 --> 00:23:25,928
What's that?

322
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:27,685
Come here. I'll show you.

323
00:23:28,252 --> 00:23:30,243
This is my new pet.
My dad gave him to me.

324
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:31,680
Neat! What's his name?

325
00:23:31,892 --> 00:23:34,042
His name's Gizmo. Hi, Giz.

326
00:23:34,252 --> 00:23:35,890
He's a mogwai.

327
00:23:42,252 --> 00:23:43,480
Cute!

328
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:48,885
Blink your eyes.

329
00:23:49,292 --> 00:23:52,284
Go like that.
Can you do that?

330
00:23:58,532 --> 00:24:00,090
Watch. Maybe he'll sing.

331
00:24:00,852 --> 00:24:04,527
Come on, Giz.
Let's go over to the table.

332
00:24:04,772 --> 00:24:06,091
I'll be careful.

333
00:24:07,492 --> 00:24:09,289
There we go.

334
00:24:11,932 --> 00:24:14,765
Gee, Billy, where
can I get one of those?

335
00:24:14,972 --> 00:24:17,691
I don't know.
This is the only one I've ever seen.

336
00:24:18,732 --> 00:24:19,687
Can I hold him?

337
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:23,487
Sure. I don't see why not.
He seems to like you.

338
00:24:24,572 --> 00:24:26,688
Great! Thanks a lot.

339
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,081
Sorry.

340
00:24:28,692 --> 00:24:30,091
What was in that jar?

341
00:24:30,292 --> 00:24:31,725
Nothing! Just water!

342
00:24:32,852 --> 00:24:34,205
Why is he making that noise?

343
00:24:41,692 --> 00:24:42,522
What is it?

344
00:24:43,372 --> 00:24:44,487
I don't know.

345
00:24:48,932 --> 00:24:50,684
Is it alive?

346
00:24:51,252 --> 00:24:52,605
I don't know.

347
00:25:50,172 --> 00:25:52,481
One, two, three,
four, five new ones.

348
00:25:53,532 --> 00:25:55,124
Now can I have one?

349
00:25:55,372 --> 00:25:56,361
I don't know.

350
00:25:56,612 --> 00:25:59,001
Look, that one's got
a cute stripe on its head.

351
00:26:03,692 --> 00:26:05,125
Isn't that incredible, Pete?

352
00:26:05,372 --> 00:26:07,090
Yeah, great.

353
00:26:07,772 --> 00:26:10,366
Don't you think this--?
This is incredible!

354
00:26:11,372 --> 00:26:13,010
Oh, it is neat.

355
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:16,290
I'm serious. It's neat.

356
00:26:20,172 --> 00:26:22,402
Gizmo, what's the matter?

357
00:26:40,172 --> 00:26:42,527
- There's something I should tell you.
- Look.

358
00:26:42,732 --> 00:26:44,643
You're familiar
with the Bathroom Buddy?

359
00:26:44,852 --> 00:26:47,127
I have made an improvement.

360
00:26:47,332 --> 00:26:48,321
Watch this.

361
00:26:48,572 --> 00:26:52,281
Now, let's say you're
late for the big meeting.

362
00:26:52,492 --> 00:26:53,811
It's really important.

363
00:26:54,052 --> 00:26:57,840
You're on your way. You reach up.
You forgot to shave.

364
00:26:58,132 --> 00:27:00,930
What're you gonna do?
Under normal circumstances...

365
00:27:01,172 --> 00:27:02,844
...you are in trouble.

366
00:27:03,052 --> 00:27:05,691
But not if you have
the Bathroom Buddy.

367
00:27:06,372 --> 00:27:07,691
Watch this.

368
00:27:09,772 --> 00:27:11,091
What do you think?

369
00:27:11,772 --> 00:27:13,251
That's pretty neat.

370
00:27:14,892 --> 00:27:15,881
What's this button?

371
00:27:19,932 --> 00:27:21,490
- Sorry, Dad.
- It's okay.

372
00:27:21,692 --> 00:27:22,488
I'm sorry.

373
00:27:22,692 --> 00:27:26,128
It's not your fault. I'm working
on that. I haven't finished that.

374
00:27:26,332 --> 00:27:29,688
I came up here because
there's a problem with the mogwai.

375
00:27:29,892 --> 00:27:31,371
Yeah, what's that?

376
00:27:32,452 --> 00:27:34,522
It multiplies with water.

377
00:27:40,772 --> 00:27:42,285
Do you see what I mean?

378
00:27:43,052 --> 00:27:44,963
I don't believe that.

379
00:27:45,172 --> 00:27:46,969
All that from water?
They got wet?

380
00:27:47,172 --> 00:27:48,491
Plain water.

381
00:27:52,652 --> 00:27:54,688
It's funny.
The new ones aren't like Gizmo.

382
00:27:54,892 --> 00:27:56,928
The striped one
seems to be the leader.

383
00:27:57,132 --> 00:27:58,121
You know what?

384
00:27:58,572 --> 00:28:01,484
I'll bet every kid in America
would like one of these.

385
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:04,122
They might replace
the dog as the family pet.

386
00:28:15,572 --> 00:28:16,368
Think about it.

387
00:28:16,732 --> 00:28:18,484
The Peltzer Pet.

388
00:28:20,372 --> 00:28:23,682
This could really be the big one.

389
00:29:15,052 --> 00:29:17,088
Barney, who did this to you?

390
00:29:17,372 --> 00:29:18,964
Hold on, I'll get you down.

391
00:29:19,172 --> 00:29:20,491
Stay still.

392
00:29:21,732 --> 00:29:25,088
Poor dog. Another minute
and he would've been a dog-sicle.

393
00:29:26,692 --> 00:29:30,480
All I know is that I'm positive
that I closed and locked the door.

394
00:29:31,772 --> 00:29:33,490
How else did she get to him?

395
00:29:33,692 --> 00:29:37,685
We can't point any fingers,
not even at Mrs. Deagle.

396
00:29:38,532 --> 00:29:41,683
She's been threatening him.
She'd love to get her hands on him.

397
00:29:41,892 --> 00:29:46,807
We don't have proof. We can't even
find footprints leading up to the house.

398
00:29:48,252 --> 00:29:51,369
I'm gonna take Barney
to your grandmother's.

399
00:29:51,612 --> 00:29:54,968
Take him there on the way to the
convention, pick him up on the way home.

400
00:29:55,172 --> 00:29:58,687
He'll be here for Christmas.
It'll be all right.

401
00:30:04,132 --> 00:30:06,088
I don't think we can drink this.

402
00:30:10,652 --> 00:30:12,085
Why not?

403
00:30:12,532 --> 00:30:14,090
What's wrong with this?

404
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:25,090
Is that a mogwai?

405
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:28,125
Yeah, I'm gonna have
Mr. Hanson check it out.

406
00:30:28,332 --> 00:30:31,881
And all of a sudden, there were
five new ones like this one.

407
00:30:33,492 --> 00:30:35,084
Now watch this.

408
00:31:10,812 --> 00:31:14,122
Can I keep one of these here,
run some tests on him?

409
00:31:15,372 --> 00:31:17,169
I think I can spare one.

410
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,765
This is some Christmas, Katie,
I'll tell you.

411
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:33,807
First the old bat closes the factory,
and now it's my goddamn plow.

412
00:31:34,012 --> 00:31:36,924
Mr. Futterman, guess what?
It's time to go home now.

413
00:31:37,132 --> 00:31:39,282
- How about one more beer?
- No, it's late.

414
00:31:39,492 --> 00:31:41,323
One more beer,
I'll help you clean up.

415
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:44,126
No, thanks, though.
It'll be okay.

416
00:31:46,932 --> 00:31:49,366
- It'll be okay.
- It will not be okay.

417
00:31:49,572 --> 00:31:53,565
I brought my plow in for a tune-up
and found it loaded with foreign parts.

418
00:31:53,932 --> 00:31:56,969
I mean, everything.
Gaskets, pistons, spark plugs.

419
00:31:57,212 --> 00:31:58,930
All of it's foreign.

420
00:32:03,132 --> 00:32:04,531
Going home?

421
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:11,240
Gremlins!

422
00:32:12,532 --> 00:32:14,523
You gotta watch out for foreigners.

423
00:32:14,772 --> 00:32:16,967
They plant gremlins
in their machinery.

424
00:32:17,172 --> 00:32:20,847
The same gremlins brought down
our planes in the big one.

425
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:22,971
That's right.

426
00:32:23,212 --> 00:32:24,645
World War II.

427
00:32:24,852 --> 00:32:25,807
Good old...

428
00:32:26,012 --> 00:32:28,321
...W-W-I-I.

429
00:32:32,092 --> 00:32:34,526
They're still shipping them over here.

430
00:32:34,732 --> 00:32:36,529
They put them in the cars, the TV.

431
00:32:36,732 --> 00:32:39,371
They put them in the radios
you stick in your ears.

432
00:32:39,612 --> 00:32:42,331
They put them in the watches.
Little teeny gremlins.

433
00:32:42,572 --> 00:32:45,882
It's not a good idea that you drive.
Why don't you walk home?

434
00:32:46,492 --> 00:32:49,165
You know, Katie, I think
maybe I'll walk home.

435
00:32:49,412 --> 00:32:50,208
Good.

436
00:32:50,412 --> 00:32:52,323
It's a nice night.

437
00:32:56,292 --> 00:32:57,725
Good night, kids.

438
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,325
Gremlins.

439
00:33:27,812 --> 00:33:31,202
That was really good,
the way you handled Mr. Futterman.

440
00:33:31,572 --> 00:33:33,130
I'm used to it.

441
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:36,331
He's been like that
ever since he lost his job.

442
00:33:37,172 --> 00:33:41,484
He's like a lot of people around here.
He just wants somebody to listen.

443
00:33:41,692 --> 00:33:43,523
Especially around the holidays.

444
00:33:44,612 --> 00:33:46,011
Why is that?

445
00:33:46,212 --> 00:33:48,931
It's when a lot of people
get really depressed.

446
00:33:50,212 --> 00:33:54,683
I always thought everyone was happy
during the holidays, no matter what.

447
00:33:54,892 --> 00:33:57,406
Most people are, but some aren't.

448
00:33:57,612 --> 00:34:01,571
While everybody else opens up presents,
they're opening up their wrists.

449
00:34:02,892 --> 00:34:03,768
Cheery thought.

450
00:34:03,972 --> 00:34:07,521
It's true. The suicide rate's
always the highest around the holidays.

451
00:34:08,972 --> 00:34:10,724
Now I'm depressed.

452
00:34:11,012 --> 00:34:13,003
Do you ever get depressed on Christmas?

453
00:34:14,332 --> 00:34:16,163
I don't celebrate Christmas.

454
00:34:16,372 --> 00:34:17,691
Are you Hindu or something?

455
00:34:17,892 --> 00:34:19,723
No, I just don't like to.

456
00:34:20,932 --> 00:34:23,526
What's not to like?
I mean, it's a lot of fun.

457
00:34:23,772 --> 00:34:24,807
God!

458
00:34:25,012 --> 00:34:27,401
Say you hate Thanksgiving,
and nobody cares.

459
00:34:27,612 --> 00:34:31,924
But say you hate Christmas, everybody
makes you feel like you're a leper.

460
00:34:34,332 --> 00:34:36,209
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

461
00:34:36,412 --> 00:34:40,530
I'm sorry. I'm just
a little tired and cranky.

462
00:34:45,572 --> 00:34:47,164
Thanks for walking me home.

463
00:34:47,412 --> 00:34:49,323
No problem.

464
00:34:50,012 --> 00:34:51,127
Good night.

465
00:34:56,012 --> 00:34:59,766
I was just wondering. Do you
get any free nights off from Dorry's?

466
00:35:00,892 --> 00:35:02,291
Thursdays.

467
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,689
Thursdays, yeah.

468
00:35:04,892 --> 00:35:07,360
Because I was just wondering...

469
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:11,884
...if you're free this Thursday night,
maybe you'd like to go out on a date...

470
00:35:13,012 --> 00:35:13,888
...with me?

471
00:35:14,092 --> 00:35:15,207
I'd love to.

472
00:35:18,412 --> 00:35:19,925
Well, that's great!

473
00:35:21,332 --> 00:35:25,484
We can talk about it
on the phone and kind of...

474
00:35:25,692 --> 00:35:27,523
...square everything away.

475
00:35:29,572 --> 00:35:30,925
Good night, Billy.

476
00:35:57,212 --> 00:35:58,531
Hey, there.

477
00:36:01,412 --> 00:36:03,972
Give me your arm, boy.
Come here, come on.

478
00:36:04,212 --> 00:36:06,931
Give me your arm.
No, this is not gonna hurt.

479
00:36:07,812 --> 00:36:09,564
This isn't gonna hurt.

480
00:36:09,812 --> 00:36:13,122
Not a big guy like you. Come on.

481
00:36:13,412 --> 00:36:17,121
There you go.
See, that's not so bad. Come on.

482
00:36:17,412 --> 00:36:20,131
Good, good.
Oh, that's good.

483
00:36:20,892 --> 00:36:24,089
Just a little blood test, pal.
You'll never miss it.

484
00:36:28,012 --> 00:36:30,321
They're like huge seed pods!

485
00:36:36,812 --> 00:36:39,007
- Having fun?
- Fun!

486
00:36:39,212 --> 00:36:40,361
Pretty neat, huh?

487
00:36:40,612 --> 00:36:41,727
Neat!

488
00:36:49,172 --> 00:36:51,561
How about shutting up
for a change, okay?

489
00:36:51,812 --> 00:36:53,325
I already fed you.

490
00:36:59,812 --> 00:37:02,167
Well, it's not 12:00 yet.

491
00:37:02,772 --> 00:37:06,685
All right. Keep an eye on them, Giz.
I'll be back in a second.

492
00:37:27,012 --> 00:37:28,411
Here we go.

493
00:37:28,612 --> 00:37:31,410
Now maybe you guys will be quiet.

494
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:43,450
You guys are really hungry.

495
00:37:46,332 --> 00:37:47,924
Giz, you want some?

496
00:37:51,732 --> 00:37:53,131
Do you want some chicken?

497
00:38:15,732 --> 00:38:18,326
That's it, good buddy.
Call it a night.

498
00:38:55,572 --> 00:38:57,802
Can 't you see?
They're after you!

499
00:38:58,012 --> 00:39:01,482
They're after all of us!
Our wives, our children, everyone!

500
00:39:01,692 --> 00:39:05,207
They're here already!
You're next!

501
00:39:05,732 --> 00:39:09,930
You're next!
You're next! You're next!

502
00:39:22,932 --> 00:39:25,127
Mom, could you come up here, please?

503
00:39:30,612 --> 00:39:34,127
Then I want you to bring
the vacuum cleaner upstairs for me.

504
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:42,168
What are they?

505
00:39:43,412 --> 00:39:46,006
Well, they're the mogwai, I guess.

506
00:39:46,212 --> 00:39:47,531
Except for Gizmo.

507
00:39:49,092 --> 00:39:50,923
Did you get them wet?

508
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,803
Did you feed them
after midnight?

509
00:39:57,012 --> 00:39:59,003
Well, I gave them
some chicken.

510
00:39:59,212 --> 00:40:00,725
But I made sure that it--

511
00:40:02,492 --> 00:40:04,210
No, no, no. Wait a minute.

512
00:40:04,412 --> 00:40:06,130
I made sure...

513
00:40:14,132 --> 00:40:15,929
What's going on here?

514
00:40:20,892 --> 00:40:22,883
What'd you say this was called?

515
00:40:23,092 --> 00:40:24,889
A putrid stage?

516
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:27,692
Pupal. Pupal stage.

517
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:29,405
Like a butterfly.

518
00:40:29,612 --> 00:40:30,488
Yeah, right.

519
00:40:30,692 --> 00:40:35,368
This is a cocoon, and inside
he's going through changes.

520
00:40:36,172 --> 00:40:37,730
Lots of changes.

521
00:40:37,972 --> 00:40:39,530
Like my mother.

522
00:40:41,012 --> 00:40:42,127
No, that's different.

523
00:40:42,372 --> 00:40:45,728
This is called a metamorphosis.

524
00:40:46,012 --> 00:40:48,003
It's a change in form...

525
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:50,123
...and in appearance.

526
00:41:16,372 --> 00:41:17,771
Hi, honey!

527
00:41:18,172 --> 00:41:19,321
No, I'm sure it works fine.

528
00:41:19,532 --> 00:41:21,648
I was just out on the back porch
for a second.

529
00:41:22,212 --> 00:41:24,123
The convention's great.

530
00:41:27,292 --> 00:41:28,771
I said it's great!

531
00:41:28,972 --> 00:41:30,564
Actually, the competition's...

532
00:41:30,772 --> 00:41:31,602
Sorry, miss.

533
00:41:31,812 --> 00:41:34,565
The competition's a little more
advanced than I expected.

534
00:41:34,772 --> 00:41:38,526
- I was giving myself an oil change.
- Some really neat things.

535
00:41:42,092 --> 00:41:43,650
Oh, Rand.

536
00:41:43,892 --> 00:41:47,407
You've never been so far
away on Christmas Eve before.

537
00:41:48,212 --> 00:41:50,282
I know it's Christmas Eve.

538
00:41:51,692 --> 00:41:53,205
I'll do the best I can.

539
00:41:53,732 --> 00:41:55,085
All right. Bye-bye.

540
00:41:57,132 --> 00:41:59,327
All I could get for it was $36!

541
00:41:59,532 --> 00:42:03,127
If there's anything I can do...
But it's completely out of my hands.

542
00:42:03,332 --> 00:42:04,811
I'll be delighted--

543
00:42:05,012 --> 00:42:07,924
Hello, Gerald.
I'm under such terrible pressure.

544
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,806
Why don't you just
speak to Mrs. Deagle about it?

545
00:42:11,012 --> 00:42:13,162
Speak to Mrs. Deagle?

546
00:42:16,132 --> 00:42:16,928
Mrs. Deagle!

547
00:42:17,892 --> 00:42:19,530
Deposit this to my account.

548
00:42:27,332 --> 00:42:29,129
Where's that psychotic canine?

549
00:42:29,332 --> 00:42:31,209
Still hiding under the counter?

550
00:42:31,412 --> 00:42:33,801
No, I'm afraid he's on vacation.

551
00:42:34,012 --> 00:42:36,890
Better keep him behind locked doors,
because if I catch him...

552
00:42:37,092 --> 00:42:39,242
...he's in for a slow death.

553
00:42:46,412 --> 00:42:48,368
Here's Mr. Bird's heart.

554
00:42:50,412 --> 00:42:52,926
Small animals lose heat
faster than large ones.

555
00:42:53,132 --> 00:42:56,204
Their blood must circulate
faster to keep their bodies warm.

556
00:42:56,412 --> 00:42:57,606
Now, in small birds...

557
00:42:57,812 --> 00:43:00,565
...their hearts beat
about 600 times per minute.

558
00:43:00,772 --> 00:43:02,728
Cats, 130.

559
00:43:02,972 --> 00:43:04,451
Man, about 75...

560
00:43:04,692 --> 00:43:08,207
...and a big old elephant's heart,
only 25 a minute.

561
00:43:08,612 --> 00:43:11,410
Hey, doc, you
got a human heart?

562
00:43:11,612 --> 00:43:16,128
Has he got a human heart?
Wait till you see this! Roll 10.

563
00:44:19,572 --> 00:44:22,962
Okay, class.
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas.

564
00:44:23,212 --> 00:44:25,168
If any of you wanna bring me
a present...

565
00:44:25,372 --> 00:44:27,522
...a cassette deck wouldn't be bad.

566
00:44:27,732 --> 00:44:30,724
Of course, tickets to the Super Bowl
would be very nice.

567
00:44:31,732 --> 00:44:34,724
Mr. Hanson, wait.
Let me just talk to you for a second.

568
00:44:36,732 --> 00:44:37,721
Bye.

569
00:45:09,412 --> 00:45:10,891
It just hatched.

570
00:45:11,412 --> 00:45:12,765
I'll be right there.

571
00:45:33,012 --> 00:45:34,491
Hey, there.

572
00:45:36,772 --> 00:45:39,809
You remember me?

573
00:45:46,812 --> 00:45:48,530
Remember me, don't you?

574
00:45:49,332 --> 00:45:50,924
I went and got you...

575
00:45:52,092 --> 00:45:53,730
...a candy bar.

576
00:45:54,012 --> 00:45:56,128
I thought you might be hungry.

577
00:45:57,292 --> 00:45:58,725
You hungry?

578
00:46:03,812 --> 00:46:06,042
You should try one of these.

579
00:46:20,692 --> 00:46:21,920
Hey, there.

580
00:46:22,692 --> 00:46:26,207
Come here. Don't be afraid.
There's no reason to be afraid.

581
00:46:27,412 --> 00:46:28,731
Where'd you go?

582
00:46:30,012 --> 00:46:32,572
Where are you?
I know you're in there.

583
00:46:32,772 --> 00:46:34,524
I know you're under there.

584
00:46:36,012 --> 00:46:37,730
Come on, now.

585
00:46:38,172 --> 00:46:41,608
You're not still angry
about that little blood test, are you?

586
00:46:42,492 --> 00:46:44,926
Come on out.
Take a bite. Let me see you.

587
00:46:45,132 --> 00:46:47,646
I just wanna see you.

588
00:46:50,492 --> 00:46:53,529
You try some of this now.
I know you gotta be hungry.

589
00:46:58,812 --> 00:47:01,406
There now. Don't you feel better?

590
00:49:35,127 --> 00:49:37,197
Gizmo ca-ca!

591
00:50:21,767 --> 00:50:23,598
Billy, are you okay?
Where are you?

592
00:50:24,007 --> 00:50:26,316
Mom, they hatched.
Get out of the house.

593
00:50:26,527 --> 00:50:28,757
Phone home. Ca-ca!

594
00:52:52,527 --> 00:52:54,483
Get out of my kitchen!

595
00:54:44,647 --> 00:54:46,285
Neat!

596
00:55:11,687 --> 00:55:13,803
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

597
00:55:23,087 --> 00:55:24,600
Mom, it's Stripe!

598
00:55:35,327 --> 00:55:36,203
Should I get it?

599
00:55:36,407 --> 00:55:38,204
Yeah, go ahead and get it.

600
00:55:38,607 --> 00:55:40,199
Oh, I didn't mean that.

601
00:55:41,167 --> 00:55:44,000
Hello, Dr. Molinaro. Can we come in?

602
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:46,198
My mom's had a bit of an accident.

603
00:55:48,287 --> 00:55:50,005
Be careful!

604
00:55:50,407 --> 00:55:51,601
What happened?

605
00:56:00,847 --> 00:56:02,041
Giz?

606
00:56:15,647 --> 00:56:17,444
Bright light! Bright light!

607
00:56:17,687 --> 00:56:19,006
Come here.

608
00:56:19,567 --> 00:56:21,000
They almost got you, huh?

609
00:56:21,767 --> 00:56:23,200
Climb in here.

610
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:28,999
The question is
totally without meaning.

611
00:56:30,247 --> 00:56:32,397
Pardon me, sir. Stuff.

612
00:56:33,887 --> 00:56:35,400
Thick and heavy.

613
00:56:35,647 --> 00:56:38,207
Would 60 gallons be sufficient?

614
00:56:38,807 --> 00:56:42,322
I rarely use it myself, sir.
It promotes rust.

615
00:56:52,407 --> 00:56:54,398
Don't worry, Giz. We'll find him.

616
00:59:06,647 --> 00:59:08,239
Gremlins, huh?

617
00:59:08,487 --> 00:59:10,364
- Little monsters.
- Right.

618
00:59:10,567 --> 00:59:11,363
Hundreds of them?

619
00:59:11,567 --> 00:59:14,604
I'm not sure.
Maybe thousands.

620
00:59:15,767 --> 00:59:18,645
Look, I know it sounds crazy.
I know it does.

621
00:59:18,847 --> 00:59:22,283
But in a matter of hours,
this town's gonna be a disaster area.

622
00:59:22,487 --> 00:59:23,886
You've got to warn people!

623
00:59:24,087 --> 00:59:26,999
- You think this kid is drunk?
- No, but you are.

624
00:59:27,567 --> 00:59:28,363
I am not drunk!

625
00:59:28,567 --> 00:59:32,606
Tell me something. Where do
these little gremlins come from?

626
00:59:32,967 --> 00:59:33,922
All right.

627
00:59:34,167 --> 00:59:37,398
My father gave me one as a present.

628
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:41,004
Does your father always
give you vicious little monsters?

629
00:59:41,207 --> 00:59:43,880
No, they don't
start out vicious at first!

630
00:59:44,087 --> 00:59:45,281
Of course not.

631
00:59:45,487 --> 00:59:48,604
They don't!
They look like this.

632
00:59:49,807 --> 00:59:51,399
Could you dim the lights?

633
00:59:51,847 --> 00:59:53,041
Sure.

634
00:59:53,647 --> 00:59:55,763
Go ahead, Brent.
Dim the lights.

635
01:00:05,367 --> 01:00:06,595
Gusto!

636
01:00:21,287 --> 01:00:24,120
'Tis the season to be jolly

637
01:00:29,007 --> 01:00:30,599
Right, Murray?

638
01:00:39,567 --> 01:00:41,797
Sheila, will you quit messing
with the TV?

639
01:00:42,687 --> 01:00:44,598
You have the thingy.

640
01:00:48,847 --> 01:00:50,599
Goddamn foreign TV.

641
01:00:53,047 --> 01:00:54,765
We should've got a Zenith!

642
01:01:05,687 --> 01:01:06,881
Foreigners.

643
01:01:11,007 --> 01:01:12,998
I can't get a damn thing on this!

644
01:01:14,047 --> 01:01:15,002
Where are you going?

645
01:01:15,207 --> 01:01:18,279
I'm gonna check the antenna.
Maybe the damn thing blew down.

646
01:01:18,487 --> 01:01:20,125
Be careful, dear.

647
01:01:37,487 --> 01:01:39,205
What the hell is that?

648
01:02:23,727 --> 01:02:26,161
- It's them!
- You're crazy!

649
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:29,006
There's a real gremlin in my cab!

650
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:02,035
Hello, Anderson.
Wanna mail something, do you?

651
01:03:02,247 --> 01:03:04,158
Just a last-minute package, Father.

652
01:03:04,367 --> 01:03:05,641
Be my guest.

653
01:03:07,567 --> 01:03:09,000
That's strange.

654
01:03:37,207 --> 01:03:38,879
Patriotic little fellow, ain't he?

655
01:03:39,087 --> 01:03:40,998
Waving the flag and everything.

656
01:03:42,887 --> 01:03:45,560
Be careful, Frank!
He might tear your arm off.

657
01:03:45,767 --> 01:03:47,837
You want me to put the cuffs on him?

658
01:03:48,047 --> 01:03:50,481
Tell me. How come
a cute guy like this...

659
01:03:50,687 --> 01:03:53,076
...can turn into
a thousand ugly monsters?

660
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:56,245
You see, this is before
it enters the pupal stage.

661
01:03:56,447 --> 01:03:58,802
Plus, it multiplies with water.

662
01:03:59,167 --> 01:04:01,761
- Get the kid some water.
- I wouldn't do that.

663
01:04:01,967 --> 01:04:03,400
Sheriff's office.

664
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:05,401
Yeah, speaking.

665
01:04:07,567 --> 01:04:08,761
What?

666
01:04:13,007 --> 01:04:15,396
Yeah, sure, we'll be right over.

667
01:04:16,167 --> 01:04:17,395
What happened?

668
01:04:17,967 --> 01:04:19,161
The Futtermans.

669
01:04:19,687 --> 01:04:23,282
Something about a snowplow.
A freak accident.

670
01:04:23,487 --> 01:04:24,761
It's the creatures!

671
01:04:24,967 --> 01:04:28,198
The creatures are making it
look like an accident!

672
01:04:29,687 --> 01:04:30,915
Will you listen to me?

673
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:32,805
You listen to me, kid!

674
01:04:33,167 --> 01:04:35,078
Go on home, take little Gizmo...

675
01:04:35,287 --> 01:04:38,438
...sit by the fireplace
and open your Christmas presents.

676
01:04:38,647 --> 01:04:40,000
Attaboy.

677
01:04:40,767 --> 01:04:42,564
- Let me drive.
- No, you're drunk.

678
01:04:42,767 --> 01:04:43,802
You always drive!

679
01:04:44,007 --> 01:04:46,123
Because I'm the sheriff, asshole.

680
01:05:01,407 --> 01:05:04,797
Kopeck, you stop that, you bad kitty!

681
01:05:05,367 --> 01:05:07,437
Kopeck's a bad kitty.

682
01:05:07,687 --> 01:05:09,803
Ruble's a good little kitty.

683
01:05:10,047 --> 01:05:14,962
We'll find you something to eat.
She's a good kitty.

684
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:20,001
Here we go. Here we go. Come on.

685
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:21,686
All right, you stop that!

686
01:05:21,887 --> 01:05:23,400
Stop it!

687
01:05:26,807 --> 01:05:30,038
Mean kitty, you start eating
before everybody gets here.

688
01:05:30,247 --> 01:05:31,839
Come on, Dollar Bill.

689
01:05:32,047 --> 01:05:34,641
Yes, here we go, Dollar Bill.

690
01:05:34,887 --> 01:05:37,959
Mommy'll fix you
something good to eat.

691
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:39,520
Everybody here?

692
01:05:39,767 --> 01:05:42,520
All right, let go of Mommy's coat.

693
01:05:42,727 --> 01:05:43,682
Here.

694
01:05:48,687 --> 01:05:50,598
Christmas carolers.

695
01:05:51,287 --> 01:05:53,847
I hate Christmas carolers.

696
01:05:54,087 --> 01:05:57,796
Screechy-voiced little glue-sniffers.

697
01:05:58,927 --> 01:06:01,395
I warned you brats!

698
01:06:15,927 --> 01:06:17,485
What are they?

699
01:06:17,687 --> 01:06:19,598
What are they?!

700
01:06:25,207 --> 01:06:26,560
They're here!

701
01:06:26,767 --> 01:06:29,804
They've come for me!
They've come!

702
01:06:32,567 --> 01:06:33,886
I'm not ready.

703
01:06:34,087 --> 01:06:36,965
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not ready!

704
01:07:01,487 --> 01:07:03,205
My God, Frye!

705
01:07:03,567 --> 01:07:04,920
That was Mrs. Deagle.

706
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:15,361
Get them off! Get them off! Help me!

707
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:19,326
That's Dave Myers.
He does Santa every year.

708
01:07:24,247 --> 01:07:26,203
What the hell is he doing now?

709
01:07:27,007 --> 01:07:28,998
What's that stuff he's
got all over him?

710
01:07:31,487 --> 01:07:33,603
Frank, I really think
we should go now.

711
01:07:33,807 --> 01:07:36,844
Start the car. I'd really like
to go back to the station.

712
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,561
Please!

713
01:08:06,887 --> 01:08:08,366
Jesus, Frank!

714
01:08:08,567 --> 01:08:10,125
What the hell are those things?

715
01:08:12,087 --> 01:08:14,555
It's Christmas.
What the hell's going on?

716
01:08:14,767 --> 01:08:15,836
Shut up, will you?!

717
01:08:43,007 --> 01:08:44,599
I don't believe it.

718
01:08:48,927 --> 01:08:50,679
You're on with Rockin' Ricky! Go!

719
01:08:50,887 --> 01:08:52,559
Hi, my name's Pete.

720
01:08:52,767 --> 01:08:55,679
These green guys are
running around wrecking things.

721
01:08:55,887 --> 01:08:58,196
This is Christmas, not Halloween!

722
01:08:58,447 --> 01:08:59,436
Listen, gang.

723
01:08:59,647 --> 01:09:02,764
Rockin' Ricky's getting fed up
with this Orson Welles crap!

724
01:09:02,967 --> 01:09:03,763
What's that?

725
01:09:03,967 --> 01:09:06,481
Kitty, what's that?
Some of Rockin' Ricky fans?

726
01:09:06,847 --> 01:09:09,202
You're not a Rockin' Ricky fan!

727
01:09:32,447 --> 01:09:35,803
Sir, I notice that you're a smoker.

728
01:09:36,567 --> 01:09:40,196
I notice that you're a smoker.
I see the cigarettes.

729
01:09:41,087 --> 01:09:43,601
I noticed, here, this broken ashtray.

730
01:09:44,567 --> 01:09:47,035
It's very fortunate
that I happened to come by.

731
01:09:47,247 --> 01:09:50,842
Let me introduce myself. My name's
Randall Peltzer. I'm an inventor.

732
01:09:51,087 --> 01:09:54,238
"Fantastic Ideas for a Fantastic World."
I make the illogical logical.

733
01:09:54,447 --> 01:09:57,883
I have something here that I think
you might be interested in.

734
01:09:58,487 --> 01:10:00,000
Yes, sir, I do.

735
01:10:00,367 --> 01:10:01,800
This is...

736
01:10:02,207 --> 01:10:04,482
...the Peltzer Smokeless Ashtray.

737
01:10:04,687 --> 01:10:07,520
I think this can solve
your problem here, sir.

738
01:10:57,967 --> 01:11:00,003
Please don't bite me!

739
01:11:01,167 --> 01:11:02,395
Wait a minute.

740
01:14:20,087 --> 01:14:20,963
You all right?

741
01:14:21,167 --> 01:14:22,600
Let's get out of here!

742
01:14:25,887 --> 01:14:27,036
What's that?

743
01:14:27,247 --> 01:14:30,000
Don't worry. He's with me.
He's not one of them.

744
01:14:35,767 --> 01:14:38,201
What's wrong?
Why isn't the car starting?

745
01:14:39,007 --> 01:14:41,396
We're gonna have to
make a run for it, okay?

746
01:14:41,647 --> 01:14:43,842
One, two, three!

747
01:15:16,807 --> 01:15:18,399
They've been here too.

748
01:15:19,247 --> 01:15:22,000
What are these things?
Where do they come from?

749
01:15:23,407 --> 01:15:25,204
They're gremlins, Kate.

750
01:15:26,447 --> 01:15:28,597
Just like Mr. Futterman said.

751
01:15:34,967 --> 01:15:37,401
Now I have another reason
to hate Christmas.

752
01:15:38,247 --> 01:15:39,726
What are you talking about?

753
01:15:40,607 --> 01:15:44,998
The worst thing that ever
happened to me was on Christmas.

754
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:47,837
Oh, God. It was so horrible.

755
01:15:51,207 --> 01:15:53,004
It was Christmas Eve.

756
01:15:53,607 --> 01:15:55,199
I was 9 years old.

757
01:15:56,647 --> 01:15:59,320
Me and Mom were decorating the tree...

758
01:16:00,007 --> 01:16:01,998
...waiting for Dad
to come home from work.

759
01:16:03,687 --> 01:16:05,405
A couple hours went by.

760
01:16:05,647 --> 01:16:07,205
Dad wasn't home.

761
01:16:07,607 --> 01:16:10,121
So Mom called the office.
No answer.

762
01:16:11,487 --> 01:16:16,003
Christmas Day came and went,
and still nothing.

763
01:16:17,687 --> 01:16:19,803
So the police began a search.

764
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:22,483
Four or five days went by.

765
01:16:22,767 --> 01:16:25,406
Neither one of us
could eat or sleep.

766
01:16:26,247 --> 01:16:28,124
Everything was falling apart.

767
01:16:29,767 --> 01:16:31,405
It was snowing outside.

768
01:16:32,287 --> 01:16:36,485
The house was freezing, so I went
to try to light up the fire.

769
01:16:36,687 --> 01:16:38,803
That's when I noticed the smell.

770
01:16:43,007 --> 01:16:45,760
The firemen came and
broke through the chimney top.

771
01:16:45,967 --> 01:16:49,960
And me and Mom were expecting
them to pull out a dead cat or a bird.

772
01:16:50,167 --> 01:16:52,806
And instead they pulled out my father.

773
01:16:57,007 --> 01:17:00,204
He was dressed
in a Santa Claus suit.

774
01:17:01,047 --> 01:17:03,436
He'd been climbing down the chimney...

775
01:17:03,647 --> 01:17:05,842
...his arms loaded with presents.

776
01:17:06,407 --> 01:17:08,204
He was gonna surprise us.

777
01:17:10,807 --> 01:17:14,197
He slipped and broke his neck.
He died instantly.

778
01:17:18,247 --> 01:17:21,000
And that's how I found out
there was no Santa Claus.

779
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:27,997
Don't worry about that smoke.
It'll stop. It's guaranteed.

780
01:17:38,047 --> 01:17:39,480
Barney, shut up!

781
01:17:39,687 --> 01:17:41,996
Don't start with me.
I got a long way to go.

782
01:17:42,687 --> 01:17:43,756
Shut up!

783
01:18:37,287 --> 01:18:38,606
Where did they all go?

784
01:18:38,807 --> 01:18:40,479
It'll be light soon.

785
01:18:40,687 --> 01:18:42,803
I bet they're all
together someplace dark.

786
01:18:51,007 --> 01:18:52,406
Mogwai!

787
01:19:21,287 --> 01:19:22,686
They're inside.

788
01:19:22,887 --> 01:19:24,240
All of them?

789
01:19:30,247 --> 01:19:31,646
Milk Duds.

790
01:20:49,887 --> 01:20:51,286
What are they doing?

791
01:20:52,687 --> 01:20:54,598
They're watching Snow White.

792
01:20:55,487 --> 01:20:57,079
And they love it.

793
01:21:04,607 --> 01:21:06,006
Where's the boiler room?

794
01:21:06,207 --> 01:21:07,879
It's in the back of the theater.

795
01:21:21,087 --> 01:21:22,406
Down there.

796
01:21:32,087 --> 01:21:32,917
Milk Duds.

797
01:22:08,167 --> 01:22:10,601
Cover your mouth.
Don't breathe any gas.

798
01:22:26,167 --> 01:22:27,361
Go.

799
01:23:10,767 --> 01:23:11,563
Hurry up!

800
01:23:11,767 --> 01:23:14,406
Go, Katie! Watch out!

801
01:23:16,807 --> 01:23:18,206
Come on!

802
01:23:57,047 --> 01:23:59,003
In the department store.

803
01:23:59,967 --> 01:24:01,241
Stripe!

804
01:24:29,087 --> 01:24:31,647
That's Stripe.
He's the leader.

805
01:24:34,087 --> 01:24:36,806
If he gets to water,
it'll start all over again.

806
01:24:53,047 --> 01:24:57,598
Take Giz. Go back and try
and find some kind of light switch.

807
01:25:08,847 --> 01:25:10,599
Careful, Billy.

808
01:26:18,447 --> 01:26:20,597
Ward is your snowplow headquarters.

809
01:26:44,087 --> 01:26:45,759
Attention, Christmas shoppers.

810
01:26:45,967 --> 01:26:50,597
Saturday morning at 8:30, we'll have
Santa Claus for all the kiddies.

811
01:27:04,847 --> 01:27:07,077
We have the Kingston Falls...

812
01:27:08,447 --> 01:27:10,005
Attention, shoppers.

813
01:28:29,487 --> 01:28:31,079
Light bright!

814
01:28:38,207 --> 01:28:40,277
Bye-bye.

815
01:29:36,047 --> 01:29:37,878
It takes a certain kind of guy.

816
01:29:38,087 --> 01:29:40,806
And that guy needs
a certain kind of dame.

817
01:30:33,287 --> 01:30:36,085
Water!

818
01:30:38,887 --> 01:30:39,922
Gun!

819
01:30:40,487 --> 01:30:43,160
It's been a rough night
for Rockin' Ricky...

820
01:30:43,847 --> 01:30:46,600
...but he's still on the air!

821
01:30:46,967 --> 01:30:49,800
The Marines are standing by
with fire hoses.

822
01:32:28,647 --> 01:32:31,036
Gizmo ca-ca!

823
01:32:31,247 --> 01:32:33,203
Light bright! Light bright!

824
01:33:10,607 --> 01:33:12,837
What the hell is that?

825
01:33:24,527 --> 01:33:25,323
Your scarf.

826
01:34:26,047 --> 01:34:27,446
We switch to a report...

827
01:34:27,647 --> 01:34:30,559
...from the scene of
the Christmas Eve riots.

828
01:34:32,047 --> 01:34:35,835
This is Lew Landers,
WDHB's Action Central News...

829
01:34:36,047 --> 01:34:38,003
...at the site of Dorry's Tavern...

830
01:34:38,367 --> 01:34:41,643
...or what used to be Dorry's Tavern,
in Kingston Falls...

831
01:34:41,847 --> 01:34:43,200
...where officials blame...

832
01:34:43,407 --> 01:34:47,116
...mass hysteria for the escalating
series of unexplained...

833
01:34:47,327 --> 01:34:51,525
...accidents, fires and explosions
that rocked this once-peaceful town...

834
01:34:52,047 --> 01:34:53,446
...on Christmas Eve.

835
01:34:53,647 --> 01:34:56,605
The bizarre demise
of Mrs. Ruby Deagle, widow...

836
01:34:56,807 --> 01:35:00,004
...of convicted stock-swindler
Donald Deagle...

837
01:35:00,447 --> 01:35:02,278
Don't chew that.

838
01:35:02,527 --> 01:35:03,755
Don't chew.

839
01:35:06,247 --> 01:35:08,442
I bet he'd like
some chicken soup.

840
01:35:13,847 --> 01:35:17,965
Honey, this is the gentleman
who sold me the mogwai.

841
01:35:18,447 --> 01:35:22,156
"Sold." An interesting choice of words.

842
01:35:26,367 --> 01:35:29,643
Conflicting eyewitness reports
concerning "little green men"...

843
01:35:32,047 --> 01:35:35,960
You teach him to watch television?

844
01:35:41,647 --> 01:35:44,161
There was, I believe, a box.

845
01:35:53,367 --> 01:35:54,482
Dad...

846
01:36:04,527 --> 01:36:06,165
Rand, your scarf.

847
01:36:08,127 --> 01:36:09,242
I warned you.

848
01:36:09,847 --> 01:36:12,998
With mogwai comes much responsibility.

849
01:36:13,247 --> 01:36:14,600
But you didn't listen.

850
01:36:14,847 --> 01:36:17,077
And you see what happens.

851
01:36:17,287 --> 01:36:19,039
I didn't mean it.

852
01:36:19,247 --> 01:36:22,523
You do with mogwai what your society...

853
01:36:22,767 --> 01:36:26,726
...has done with all of nature's gifts.

854
01:36:26,927 --> 01:36:28,963
You do not understand.

855
01:36:31,327 --> 01:36:32,646
You are not ready.

856
01:36:47,927 --> 01:36:50,043
He has something to say to you.

857
01:36:56,327 --> 01:36:59,000
You understand what
he says when he speaks to you?

858
01:36:59,207 --> 01:37:02,358
To hear, one has only to listen.

859
01:37:06,047 --> 01:37:07,560
Bye, Billy.

860
01:37:13,327 --> 01:37:16,239
Perhaps someday you may be ready.

861
01:37:16,447 --> 01:37:18,278
Until then, mogwai...

862
01:37:18,687 --> 01:37:20,166
...will be waiting.

863
01:37:23,247 --> 01:37:24,566
Excuse me, sir.

864
01:37:25,407 --> 01:37:27,398
Before you go, I wanted to tell you...

865
01:37:27,647 --> 01:37:30,320
...that I am truly sorry
for what's happened.

866
01:37:30,807 --> 01:37:33,605
And if you would accept it,
I'd like to...

867
01:37:33,807 --> 01:37:35,718
...give you this small token.

868
01:37:36,007 --> 01:37:39,158
There's one other one.
This is an invention of mine.

869
01:37:39,367 --> 01:37:41,323
Smokeless Ashtray.

870
01:37:41,527 --> 01:37:42,516
How did you know?

871
01:37:42,727 --> 01:37:45,525
Man at gas station tried to sell me.

872
01:37:45,767 --> 01:37:48,361
Latest word in technology.

873
01:37:48,927 --> 01:37:50,997
Very generous of you.

874
01:37:51,207 --> 01:37:53,960
I'm sure it will come in handy.

875
01:38:19,047 --> 01:38:21,242
Well, that's the story.

876
01:38:21,807 --> 01:38:26,164
So if your air conditioner goes on the
fritz, your washing machine blows up...

877
01:38:26,367 --> 01:38:28,722
...or your video recorder conks out...

878
01:38:28,927 --> 01:38:30,883
...before you call the repairman...

879
01:38:31,207 --> 01:38:34,358
...turn on the lights,
check the closets and cupboards...

880
01:38:34,847 --> 01:38:36,838
...look under all the beds.

881
01:38:37,047 --> 01:38:39,003
Because you never can tell.

882
01:38:39,807 --> 01:38:43,356
There just might be
a gremlin in your house.
