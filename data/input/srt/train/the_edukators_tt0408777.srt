1
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,391
- Fluffy, why are you there?
- Put your cat away.

2
00:01:33,534 --> 00:01:35,034
The alarm is off.

3
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:36,388
Heat the sauna, dear.

4
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:37,888
Right away.

5
00:01:38,337 --> 00:01:40,040
I'm incredibly thirsty.

6
00:01:54,296 --> 00:01:55,797
Mom, look!

7
00:01:57,078 --> 00:01:58,577
What's that?

8
00:02:01,648 --> 00:02:03,148
The stereo is gone.

9
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:07,188
My porcelain soldiers!

10
00:02:10,526 --> 00:02:12,026
Mom, your soldiers!

11
00:02:20,904 --> 00:02:22,374
Don't touch anything!

12
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,397
- Call the police.
- At once.

13
00:02:25,631 --> 00:02:27,131
Laura, don't touch!

14
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,680
There is a letter.

15
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,974
The stereo is in the fridge.

16
00:02:32,447 --> 00:02:33,948
Readme!

17
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,025
Your Days of Plenty are Numbered.

18
00:04:04,528 --> 00:04:06,985
They work 14-hours days for peanuts!

19
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,760
7 days a week!

20
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,256
We buy the shoes for 100 Euros.

21
00:04:13,464 --> 00:04:15,799
But they only cost 5 Euros to make!

22
00:04:19,157 --> 00:04:21,954
Do you know who really makes those shoes?

23
00:04:22,293 --> 00:04:23,314
No

24
00:04:23,315 --> 00:04:24,814
Children in Indonesia, the Philippines...

25
00:04:24,855 --> 00:04:26,734
Please leave the store.

26
00:04:27,057 --> 00:04:28,851
In Indonesia, Philippines...

27
00:04:29,163 --> 00:04:30,663
This isn't allowed.

28
00:04:30,898 --> 00:04:33,178
That's enough. Get out!

29
00:04:33,503 --> 00:04:35,597
I'm just handing out flyers.
Don't touch me!

30
00:04:38,163 --> 00:04:42,646
They’re made by children
between the ages of 12 and 16!

31
00:04:44,902 --> 00:04:46,630
Capitalist pigs!

32
00:04:48,928 --> 00:04:50,428
Pigs!

33
00:04:51,383 --> 00:04:53,504
The state supports capitalism!

34
00:05:00,726 --> 00:05:02,226
Let go of him!

35
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:04,536
The demonstration is legal!
,

36
00:05:50,215 --> 00:05:51,715
There's Miss Lindner!

37
00:05:51,858 --> 00:05:53,801
Eviction papers for you.

38
00:05:54,214 --> 00:05:56,039
Two weeks to vacate.

39
00:05:56,309 --> 00:05:59,015
Leave it in tip-top shape
or loose deposit.

40
00:06:01,008 --> 00:06:02,508
But I paid the rent back.

41
00:06:02,755 --> 00:06:04,309
Yes, but 6 months too late.

42
00:06:05,368 --> 00:06:06,867
Have a nice day!

43
00:06:41,922 --> 00:06:43,807
Ticket control!
Tickets please.

44
00:06:45,508 --> 00:06:47,022
Young man, did you hear me?

45
00:06:47,536 --> 00:06:49,374
You, there. Ticket please!

46
00:06:50,472 --> 00:06:52,265
What a stench!

47
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:54,249
He stinks up the entire car

48
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:56,133
Let's see you ticket.

49
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,635
- Stop drinking.
- ¡Leave me alone!

50
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:02,395
Take it easy or else!

51
00:07:03,276 --> 00:07:05,020
Show me your ticket.

52
00:07:05,888 --> 00:07:07,390
Ticket, please.

53
00:07:07,975 --> 00:07:09,441
Do you have a ticket?

54
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:11,466
Take your hands off!

55
00:07:13,171 --> 00:07:14,692
No drinking in here!

56
00:07:15,047 --> 00:07:16,547
That's enough!

57
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:19,629
What's going on?

58
00:07:19,668 --> 00:07:21,168
Mind your own business.

59
00:07:21,434 --> 00:07:22,978
He is a total wreck.
Leave him alone.

60
00:07:23,594 --> 00:07:25,094
What's it to you?

61
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,195
End of the line for you.

62
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:31,282
Here, you dropped this.

63
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:37,873
Hold on.

64
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,977
Jule, what's wrong?

65
00:08:01,755 --> 00:08:03,255
Everything, nothing...

66
00:08:03,776 --> 00:08:05,568
Move in with us for now.

67
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:09,113
A cosy little commune.

68
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:11,691
Sure.

69
00:08:16,182 --> 00:08:17,836
Taste this. It's raspberry.

70
00:08:20,723 --> 00:08:23,785
Choose the bright colors,
not always the depressing ones.

71
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:40,634
Shit!

72
00:08:51,134 --> 00:08:52,634
Jan!

73
00:08:52,716 --> 00:08:54,216
What a pain!

74
00:09:13,616 --> 00:09:14,700
Bastard!

75
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:16,843
Do you think it was a good
idea to move in with Jan?

76
00:09:17,582 --> 00:09:19,083
Jan is totally alright.

77
00:09:19,787 --> 00:09:21,287
You just have to know him better.

78
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,690
I dunno.

79
00:09:25,758 --> 00:09:27,997
Sometimes he gives me
this really aggressive look.

80
00:09:29,718 --> 00:09:31,253
Really scary.

81
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:35,856
Jule, I've known Jan for 15 years.

82
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,304
He's a little unpredictable.

83
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:41,308
But he's a loyal soul.

84
00:09:42,003 --> 00:09:43,926
And he's got a backbone.
Not many people do.

85
00:09:44,664 --> 00:09:46,969
I dunno. He's kind of weird.

86
00:09:51,063 --> 00:09:52,627
What's that?

87
00:09:54,852 --> 00:09:57,653
Oxygen concentrator...
He bought it "used" the other day.

88
00:09:57,949 --> 00:09:59,449
Really?

89
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,685
Are you excited
about going to Barcelona?

90
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:07,549
Sure!

91
00:10:09,147 --> 00:10:10,647
Are you excited?

92
00:10:13,284 --> 00:10:15,449
It's just that my debts
are out of control.

93
00:10:17,057 --> 00:10:19,920
Baby, it's my treat. Completely.

94
00:10:20,481 --> 00:10:22,067
We'll have a great time.

95
00:10:22,851 --> 00:10:24,613
You just don't get it.

96
00:10:26,729 --> 00:10:28,635
I have to straighten this out.

97
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:32,443
Beating yourself up
wont make things better.

98
00:10:33,893 --> 00:10:35,393
Try to relax!

99
00:10:36,352 --> 00:10:37,943
Just forget it.

100
00:10:47,002 --> 00:10:48,502
Hello.

101
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,004
Man, we have to find
a new approach.

102
00:11:30,746 --> 00:11:32,247
Take it to another level.

103
00:11:32,497 --> 00:11:33,997
Everything is fine.

104
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:36,106
Bullshit!

105
00:11:37,472 --> 00:11:39,140
We need to see things...

106
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,947
in a larger context.

107
00:11:42,164 --> 00:11:43,664
What are you talking about?

108
00:11:44,701 --> 00:11:46,201
Forget it!

109
00:11:47,393 --> 00:11:49,623
- Got a light?
- Check in my bag.

110
00:11:53,554 --> 00:11:55,054
No.

111
00:11:55,336 --> 00:11:57,168
Look in the small one.
Open your eyes!

112
00:12:05,188 --> 00:12:06,687
What is this?

113
00:12:07,613 --> 00:12:09,113
Looks like a watch to me.

114
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:13,120
Won it at poker?

115
00:12:13,443 --> 00:12:14,943
I think so, yeah.

116
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:19,135
- Peter, are you nuts?
- No, I won it.

117
00:12:19,445 --> 00:12:21,525
Put it back where you found it.

118
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:24,136
- Yeah, I'll do that.
- OK. Thanks.

119
00:12:27,668 --> 00:12:29,867
- Man, are you crazy?
- What?

120
00:12:30,535 --> 00:12:32,959
You just threw 5000 Euros
out of the window!

121
00:12:33,577 --> 00:12:34,654
So what?

122
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:36,116
Yeah, so what?

123
00:12:36,117 --> 00:12:37,618
It's a principle!

124
00:12:37,832 --> 00:12:39,816
You and your damn morals!

125
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:41,527
What morals?

126
00:12:41,785 --> 00:12:44,500
What's it worth if we
are seen as common burglars?

127
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,285
If we can't agree,
then let's just drop it.

128
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,352
OK, man. I got it.

129
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:54,792
But in Kreuzberg,
I know this Turk...

130
00:12:54,993 --> 00:12:58,754
He would have given me 2500 for it.
We could have split 50/50.

131
00:13:00,463 --> 00:13:03,100
You don't get it
and you don't want to!

132
00:13:03,377 --> 00:13:05,753
But it was just sitting there...

133
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,899
So shiny, calling out to me.

134
00:13:17,211 --> 00:13:18,711
It's green.

135
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,756
Change the station.

136
00:13:29,571 --> 00:13:32,585
So far, so far away from home...

137
00:13:34,673 --> 00:13:36,666
Shit it won't get any louder.

138
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,517
No hellos, no hearts, no kisses

139
00:13:41,706 --> 00:13:43,251
No sorrow.

140
00:13:43,502 --> 00:13:47,547
Everything so far, so far away.

141
00:13:47,862 --> 00:13:49,998
The best of times

142
00:13:50,218 --> 00:13:51,718
You asshole!

143
00:13:51,847 --> 00:13:54,200
...where flowers bloom,

144
00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:58,063
where my sweetheart lives...

145
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,596
One more time!

146
00:13:59,597 --> 00:14:01,097
Fucking awesome!

147
00:14:14,105 --> 00:14:15,605
Miss!

148
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:18,983
We ordered Williams pear brandy.

149
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:21,692
That's William pear brandy.

150
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,984
But never in these glasses!

151
00:14:24,227 --> 00:14:25,933
These are liqueur glasses.

152
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:27,981
So?

153
00:14:27,981 --> 00:14:31,029
Can't beverages be served
in their proper glasses?

154
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:33,972
I simply cannot drink
from this glass.

155
00:14:36,316 --> 00:14:37,815
Thank you.

156
00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:39,976
- Just a moment, please.
- By the way...

157
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:45,020
Don't use the same brandy.
It's lost its flavor, understand?

158
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:47,411
Yes, by all means.

159
00:14:51,418 --> 00:14:54,461
Table 47 prefers brandy glasses.

160
00:14:55,465 --> 00:14:57,492
You have more customers.
At table 22.

161
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,169
Dream on your own time!

162
00:16:23,351 --> 00:16:24,852
Be careful getting home!

163
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,909
- Sweet dreams.
- You too.

164
00:16:36,093 --> 00:16:37,862
Can't you do something else?

165
00:16:39,057 --> 00:16:42,204
Putting up those posters
doesn't pay much.

166
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,700
Plus, you're out all night.

167
00:16:45,136 --> 00:16:48,701
Yeah, I'm sick of it too.
But there's nothing else

168
00:16:49,418 --> 00:16:50,918
Good night.

169
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:37,956
What?

170
00:17:38,716 --> 00:17:40,071
You can't go?

171
00:17:40,073 --> 00:17:41,697
I have to turn over the apartment.

172
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,149
That asshole! I can't believe it.

173
00:17:45,433 --> 00:17:47,625
It's only 3 days.
I don't get it.

174
00:17:48,962 --> 00:17:50,462
Shit!

175
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:55,334
Then I'm staying too.

176
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:58,629
No, this is your big break.

177
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:02,946
You have to go alone.

178
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,642
I'll find someone to help you, OK?

179
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:08,839
Sorry, I overslept.

180
00:19:15,194 --> 00:19:16,860
You can use this one.

181
00:19:18,051 --> 00:19:19,692
- Here?
- Maybe over there.

182
00:19:38,568 --> 00:19:40,068
How about some music?

183
00:19:56,439 --> 00:19:57,939
Is that Jeff Cole?

184
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:06,566
I saw him in concert.

185
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,639
At the Columbia?

186
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,580
I was there.

187
00:20:20,942 --> 00:20:22,725
Funny, I didn't see you!

188
00:20:28,913 --> 00:20:31,330
This is a great place.
Why move?

189
00:20:33,171 --> 00:20:34,740
I can't afford it.

190
00:20:35,938 --> 00:20:37,431
Your debts?

191
00:20:37,432 --> 00:20:38,932
Peter told you?

192
00:20:39,021 --> 00:20:40,521
He mentioned it.

193
00:20:40,986 --> 00:20:42,486
That idiot.

194
00:20:42,552 --> 00:20:44,052
It's not a big deal.

195
00:20:44,442 --> 00:20:45,942
We all have debts.

196
00:20:46,552 --> 00:20:48,052
But not like me.

197
00:20:49,487 --> 00:20:51,702
I probably can't compeed but...

198
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:54,142
How much?

199
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,794
1000 Euros? 10000 Euros?

200
00:20:58,042 --> 00:20:59,839
More? 20000?

201
00:21:02,045 --> 00:21:03,545
- 30000?
- Jan, please...

202
00:21:03,969 --> 00:21:05,469
Don't ruin my day.

203
00:21:24,612 --> 00:21:26,350
94500.

204
00:21:28,766 --> 00:21:30,266
Euros?

205
00:21:33,618 --> 00:21:35,867
What did you do? Burn down a factory?

206
00:21:37,143 --> 00:21:38,643
If only.

207
00:21:39,614 --> 00:21:41,861
A year ago, on the highway...

208
00:21:42,616 --> 00:21:44,116
I was in my old Golf.

209
00:21:44,446 --> 00:21:47,761
Ahead of me, this executive
driving his Mercedes S-Class.

210
00:21:48,715 --> 00:21:50,628
He brakes. I don't.

211
00:21:50,864 --> 00:21:52,479
His car is totaled.

212
00:21:52,888 --> 00:21:55,753
My registration had expired.
I hadn't paid my insurance.

213
00:21:56,988 --> 00:21:59,250
That fucking Mercedes
cost 100000 Euros.

214
00:22:01,005 --> 00:22:03,169
But I'm now down to 94500.

215
00:22:06,013 --> 00:22:08,031
You work your butt off

216
00:22:08,456 --> 00:22:11,092
so that some big shot
can drive a Mercedes?

217
00:22:13,656 --> 00:22:17,286
For executives like him...
That car is petty cash.

218
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,581
But it was my fault.
He was in the right

219
00:22:20,953 --> 00:22:22,955
In the right? Is that justice?

220
00:22:25,272 --> 00:22:27,672
You are paying for
some jerk's lifestyle.

221
00:22:28,474 --> 00:22:29,973
A 100000-Euro car?

222
00:22:31,061 --> 00:22:32,885
Why not gold-plated pipes?

223
00:22:33,112 --> 00:22:34,612
It makes me sick too!

224
00:22:36,504 --> 00:22:38,464
I should never have reached
for the glove compartment.

225
00:22:39,714 --> 00:22:41,720
I screwed up.
Now I pay the price.

226
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,527
Who says that?

227
00:22:44,517 --> 00:22:46,017
The cops?

228
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,695
The prosecutors, the news rags?

229
00:22:48,622 --> 00:22:50,192
Fucking petty bourgeois ethic!

230
00:22:53,389 --> 00:22:55,468
Decency, honesty, family values...

231
00:22:55,864 --> 00:22:57,364
Get to work on time,
pay your taxes...

232
00:22:57,787 --> 00:22:59,331
All hammered into us.

233
00:22:59,616 --> 00:23:02,137
First in school, then on TV.
For what?

234
00:23:02,338 --> 00:23:04,685
So guys like that can
buy expensive cars?

235
00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:06,675
To hell with those morals!

236
00:23:07,015 --> 00:23:08,818
Ruining a young woman's
life is immoral.

237
00:23:09,371 --> 00:23:12,354
Think that guy ever thought
he was wrong?

238
00:23:15,037 --> 00:23:16,537
You are right.

239
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:19,656
But I missed a payment once...

240
00:23:19,996 --> 00:23:21,813
They were knocking on my door.

241
00:23:22,939 --> 00:23:26,188
Step 1: Recognizing injustice.
Step 2: Action.

242
00:23:27,015 --> 00:23:28,515
But how?

243
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,071
Take the first step alone.
Find allies for the second.

244
00:23:33,035 --> 00:23:34,535
From where?

245
00:23:35,964 --> 00:23:38,500
Take the first step, then call me.

246
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,259
I calculated how much of my life...

247
00:23:48,536 --> 00:23:50,638
I'm giving to that asshole...
Just for fun.

248
00:23:53,021 --> 00:23:54,338
And?

249
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:56,812
About 8 years.
But only once I'm a teacher.

250
00:23:58,107 --> 00:23:59,935
That's what you want to do?

251
00:24:00,337 --> 00:24:01,837
Better than waitressing.

252
00:24:14,714 --> 00:24:16,214
Concretely...

253
00:24:19,176 --> 00:24:20,677
I guess I wanted...

254
00:24:27,121 --> 00:24:29,328
This might sound stupid.

255
00:24:31,912 --> 00:24:33,414
I guess I just wanted

256
00:24:34,878 --> 00:24:37,033
to live wild an free.

257
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,640
That's not stupid.

258
00:24:40,301 --> 00:24:41,801
It's OK.

259
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,172
That's what half of us want.

260
00:24:46,561 --> 00:24:47,946
Then come the compromises.

261
00:24:47,947 --> 00:24:49,534
That's how it goes.

262
00:24:50,457 --> 00:24:51,957
Not necessarily.

263
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:56,000
Sometimes not.
Some people make it.

264
00:25:00,353 --> 00:25:01,854
Anyhow...

265
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:05,745
If you keep working
for that asshole,

266
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:09,117
you'll loose faith
in everything.

267
00:25:14,898 --> 00:25:16,398
I go this way.

268
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:18,799
I go that way.

269
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,940
Thanks again.

270
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,441
If you still need help,

271
00:25:26,114 --> 00:25:27,614
I can come again.

272
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,207
Great!

273
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:31,708
Sure.

274
00:25:33,642 --> 00:25:36,001
- So where are you headed?
- Sleeping at a girlfriend's.

275
00:25:38,215 --> 00:25:39,715
How about you?

276
00:25:42,569 --> 00:25:44,069
I think I'll cook something.

277
00:25:46,956 --> 00:25:48,458
Want to join me?

278
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:54,001
Gladly.

279
00:26:24,621 --> 00:26:26,350
DAYS OF PLENTY.

280
00:26:33,476 --> 00:26:34,976
All washed up?

281
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:37,762
Shall we cook?

282
00:26:44,088 --> 00:26:45,588
Jan, it was great.

283
00:26:49,806 --> 00:26:52,350
Guys who can cook
must get all the girls.

284
00:26:53,201 --> 00:26:54,700
Not really.

285
00:26:56,178 --> 00:26:58,162
Other things count more.

286
00:26:58,861 --> 00:27:00,364
You join me for a smoke?

287
00:27:03,377 --> 00:27:04,878
I don't know.

288
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,240
It's dessert.

289
00:27:07,546 --> 00:27:10,232
Dope chokes young people's
revolutionary energy.

290
00:27:14,593 --> 00:27:16,093
Grass too?

291
00:27:17,234 --> 00:27:18,748
No, grass is OK.

292
00:27:22,184 --> 00:27:24,937
The drugs the body produces
aren't bad either.

293
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,681
Actually, they're greats.

294
00:27:27,369 --> 00:27:28,732
Like adrenalin?

295
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:30,207
For example.

296
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:32,012
There are thousands. Endorphins...

297
00:27:32,655 --> 00:27:36,038
Happiness hormones
when you are in love...

298
00:27:36,723 --> 00:27:39,872
Now you're talking hard drugs.
Watch out for those.

299
00:27:40,707 --> 00:27:42,485
Don't fall into a life of crime!

300
00:27:47,973 --> 00:27:50,044
Fear is an awesome drug.

301
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,598
Don't let fear take control.

302
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,571
Use it as a motor.

303
00:27:57,669 --> 00:27:59,170
It takes practice.

304
00:27:59,235 --> 00:28:01,643
Put yourself into a situation
where you're scared stiff.

305
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:04,582
First there's panic.

306
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:06,359
But after a while,

307
00:28:06,749 --> 00:28:10,450
the body's self-protection
system kicks in.

308
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,280
You do things you never dared.

309
00:28:13,963 --> 00:28:18,975
You overcome you limitations.
You believe you can do anything.

310
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,666
Really!

311
00:28:22,882 --> 00:28:24,382
Do you know it or think it?

312
00:28:24,797 --> 00:28:27,797
I know it.
Done it a thousand times.

313
00:28:28,378 --> 00:28:29,878
¨A thousand times gone bad...¨

314
00:29:36,925 --> 00:29:38,425
Run a check on-that plate.

315
00:29:53,365 --> 00:29:54,865
It's OK.

316
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,806
It works if you smear it.

317
00:30:17,061 --> 00:30:18,627
It's not good wallpaper.

318
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:21,073
- How come?
- The glue isn't right.

319
00:30:23,296 --> 00:30:25,081
But i followed the instructions.

320
00:30:27,007 --> 00:30:28,507
Shit!

321
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,300
You know what?

322
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,810
Fuck the deposit!

323
00:31:06,815 --> 00:31:08,959
We should have done this before.
It works.

324
00:31:10,318 --> 00:31:11,818
Hope they'll like it.

325
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,290
Look.

326
00:31:25,078 --> 00:31:27,531
Every heart is a revolutionary cell.

327
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:30,800
Smile!

328
00:31:40,355 --> 00:31:43,341
Excuse me...

329
00:31:50,685 --> 00:31:52,107
Your hair!

330
00:31:52,107 --> 00:31:53,608
Yes, I'll fix it.

331
00:32:03,619 --> 00:32:05,806
Roast beef with potatoes
and summer vegetables.

332
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:44,927
We should smoke downstairs
in the storeroom.

333
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,528
Why not tell him too?

334
00:32:47,813 --> 00:32:50,629
That way he can say
all we do is smoke.

335
00:32:51,296 --> 00:32:52,796
You're right.

336
00:32:55,271 --> 00:32:57,578
There you are!
The place is packed.

337
00:32:57,993 --> 00:32:59,303
Just fixing my hair.

338
00:32:59,304 --> 00:33:00,804
I can tell.

339
00:33:04,189 --> 00:33:06,024
Are you crazy?
In the kitchen?

340
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:08,496
- I'm truly sorry, .
- What were you thinking?

341
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,741
Know what?

342
00:33:11,052 --> 00:33:14,253
I've had it with you.
That's enough. You're fired.

343
00:33:14,464 --> 00:33:16,157
No, boss. I need this job.

344
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,935
It's my fault. I smoked first.

345
00:33:19,192 --> 00:33:20,692
I said it was OK.

346
00:33:20,845 --> 00:33:22,460
Then you are fired too.

347
00:33:23,446 --> 00:33:24,946
- What?
- Pack it up!

348
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,630
Wait, Jule. Let me.

349
00:33:26,681 --> 00:33:28,181
Boss, wait!

350
00:33:30,956 --> 00:33:32,756
Why can't I shut up?

351
00:33:34,702 --> 00:33:36,202
What for?

352
00:33:36,394 --> 00:33:38,963
It's great that you defended him.

353
00:33:42,633 --> 00:33:43,914
Yeah sure.

354
00:33:43,915 --> 00:33:45,632
But I need that job, you see.

355
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:48,309
No, I don't see.

356
00:33:49,675 --> 00:33:51,397
You go to all those protests...

357
00:33:53,055 --> 00:33:55,096
against exploitation and oppression...

358
00:33:56,447 --> 00:33:59,040
but you're still
some bastard's slave.

359
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:07,074
Those protests are totally useless.

360
00:34:11,692 --> 00:34:13,286
The rebellion is difficult now.

361
00:34:14,722 --> 00:34:17,577
Before, all it took was
dope and long hair.

362
00:34:18,654 --> 00:34:21,203
And the establishment
was automatically against you.

363
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:25,172
What was considered subversive then

364
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:26,899
you can buy in shops today.

365
00:34:27,602 --> 00:34:31,104
Che Guevara t-shirts
or anarchy stickers.

366
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:36,252
That's why there aren't any more
youth movements.

367
00:34:37,939 --> 00:34:40,612
Everyone has the feeling
it's all be done before.

368
00:34:41,843 --> 00:34:45,415
Others tried and failed.
Why should it work for us?

369
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,943
For all revolutions,
one thing is clear...

370
00:34:57,398 --> 00:35:01,296
Even if some didn’t work,
the most important thing is...

371
00:35:01,636 --> 00:35:03,986
that the best ideas survived.

372
00:35:04,317 --> 00:35:06,932
The same goes for personal revolts.

373
00:35:08,021 --> 00:35:09,576
What turns out good...

374
00:35:10,304 --> 00:35:12,606
what survives in you...

375
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,421
that makes you stronger.

376
00:35:29,033 --> 00:35:30,532
What do you think?

377
00:35:30,604 --> 00:35:33,545
How many people down there
are thinking about revolution?

378
00:35:36,007 --> 00:35:37,522
In this moment, not many.

379
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,258
At 10:45, they are watching TV.

380
00:35:41,946 --> 00:35:43,446
Probably.

381
00:35:44,318 --> 00:35:47,730
Europeans spend 4 hours a day
in front of the boob tube.

382
00:35:48,214 --> 00:35:49,714
4 hours!

383
00:35:50,122 --> 00:35:51,622
Terrible!

384
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:54,495
Doesn't leave much time
for revolutionary thoughts.

385
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,580
You know...

386
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,797
Not being part of all that...

387
00:36:02,768 --> 00:36:04,268
that's not the problem.

388
00:36:04,476 --> 00:36:05,976
The problem is...

389
00:36:06,649 --> 00:36:09,438
I can't find anything
I really want to believe in.

390
00:36:16,262 --> 00:36:18,507
Got any ideas for me?

391
00:36:24,156 --> 00:36:25,656
Follow me.

392
00:36:47,716 --> 00:36:49,217
Now what?

393
00:36:49,728 --> 00:36:51,227
Who lives here?

394
00:36:53,193 --> 00:36:54,802
You never wondered why

395
00:36:55,669 --> 00:36:57,492
Peter and I stay out all night?

396
00:36:58,112 --> 00:37:00,460
To put up posters. What else?

397
00:37:02,214 --> 00:37:03,714
Then...

398
00:37:04,235 --> 00:37:05,735
What do you do?

399
00:37:07,595 --> 00:37:09,721
We are driving around looking for villas.

400
00:37:11,444 --> 00:37:14,792
When we find one we like...

401
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:16,152
we take a closer look.

402
00:37:16,153 --> 00:37:20,264
Then what? You take pretty photos
and put them in an album?

403
00:37:22,877 --> 00:37:24,377
Is this a joke?

404
00:37:25,484 --> 00:37:27,062
We break into them.

405
00:37:31,011 --> 00:37:32,510
Just one catch.

406
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:34,793
We don't steal anything.

407
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,806
We re-arrange the furniture.

408
00:37:39,207 --> 00:37:40,708
And we leave a message.

409
00:37:41,061 --> 00:37:44,035
"Your Days of Plenty are Numbered"

410
00:37:44,636 --> 00:37:46,501
or "You Have Too Much Money"...

411
00:37:46,881 --> 00:37:48,381
signed "The Edukators"

412
00:37:49,771 --> 00:37:51,491
You and Peter are the Edukators?

413
00:37:56,654 --> 00:37:58,154
Why?

414
00:37:59,531 --> 00:38:01,527
So they feel less safe...

415
00:38:02,228 --> 00:38:03,728
in their high security neighborhoods.

416
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,776
It's a creepy feeling...
Someone has been in your home.

417
00:38:09,032 --> 00:38:10,532
They have been watching you.

418
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:13,269
And they will keep watching you.

419
00:38:15,904 --> 00:38:18,878
Why not empty the villas
and give everything to the poor?

420
00:38:20,062 --> 00:38:21,605
They expect burglars.

421
00:38:23,065 --> 00:38:25,097
We want to really scare them.

422
00:38:25,628 --> 00:38:27,421
Standing in the bank,

423
00:38:27,802 --> 00:38:29,402
they'll hear faint whispers:

424
00:38:30,314 --> 00:38:31,814
"You have too much money..."

425
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,068
"You have too much money..."

426
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,939
They'll feel completely alone.

427
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:40,710
Nothing can help them.

428
00:38:41,211 --> 00:38:43,816
Not money, not a spouse,
not any damn cop.

429
00:38:47,607 --> 00:38:49,107
Are you serious?

430
00:38:52,178 --> 00:38:53,678
I'll show you.

431
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,804
Guess where the camera is?

432
00:39:08,766 --> 00:39:10,266
Behind the grill.

433
00:39:20,331 --> 00:39:21,830
Skeleton key...

434
00:39:23,588 --> 00:39:25,089
Look at this.

435
00:39:26,816 --> 00:39:28,804
Peter found this list.

436
00:39:29,728 --> 00:39:31,980
The x's mark our hits.

437
00:39:34,744 --> 00:39:36,244
This is real.

438
00:39:39,929 --> 00:39:42,552
No way... This is insane.

439
00:39:43,195 --> 00:39:44,695
How did it start?

440
00:39:45,447 --> 00:39:46,946
Not a clue.

441
00:39:48,505 --> 00:39:50,251
Peter installed alarm systems.

442
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:53,329
I once asked him...

443
00:39:54,248 --> 00:39:57,038
if he knew how
to disable an alarm system.

444
00:39:58,758 --> 00:40:00,258
He said no problem.

445
00:40:02,145 --> 00:40:03,645
So we did it

446
00:40:05,355 --> 00:40:07,042
You two...

447
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:12,276
Isn't this Zehelendorf?

448
00:40:15,475 --> 00:40:16,975
Which street?

449
00:40:17,729 --> 00:40:19,229
Finkenbachstrasse.

450
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,070
No way! Wait...

451
00:40:25,462 --> 00:40:26,960
Shit!

452
00:40:27,074 --> 00:40:28,574
Jan, shit!

453
00:40:29,142 --> 00:40:31,452
Take a left down there, OK?
Now I'll show you!

454
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:51,812
That must be it, there!

455
00:40:52,013 --> 00:40:54,491
Stop, pull over there.
I think that asshole...

456
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:56,553
I owe money to lives there.

457
00:40:59,103 --> 00:41:00,603
What are you doing?

458
00:41:05,862 --> 00:41:07,362
He really lives here.

459
00:41:08,358 --> 00:41:10,303
The mailbox is full.
They must be away.

460
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:13,199
Let's take a look.

461
00:41:23,145 --> 00:41:25,040
Down at the lake we can get in.

462
00:41:28,106 --> 00:41:30,134
Don't be a drag!
Let's just take a peek.

463
00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:36,849
Wait up!

464
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:39,699
See?

465
00:41:52,005 --> 00:41:53,505
Check out this place!

466
00:41:56,077 --> 00:41:57,847
With boat and private dock...

467
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:15,769
The blinds are down.
They must be on vacation.

468
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,575
Don't be so sure.

469
00:42:17,999 --> 00:42:19,872
How would you break in?

470
00:42:23,629 --> 00:42:25,165
Maybe through a cellar window.

471
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:27,857
Let's go closer!

472
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,379
Doesn't that look like
the ideal point of entry?

473
00:42:39,945 --> 00:42:41,445
Totally hidden.

474
00:42:44,567 --> 00:42:46,067
It could work.

475
00:42:46,761 --> 00:42:48,261
Let's break.

476
00:42:48,828 --> 00:42:50,390
You're insane. No way!

477
00:42:51,242 --> 00:42:53,538
I have to see how
that asshole lives. Please!

478
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:56,745
This is too spontaneous.
It's too risky

479
00:42:58,611 --> 00:43:01,289
But you're a pro.
I just want a peek!

480
00:43:03,262 --> 00:43:04,839
Jule, I'm not a pro.

481
00:43:06,095 --> 00:43:07,748
We have to monitor the house first.

482
00:43:09,284 --> 00:43:11,090
You can see no one's home.

483
00:43:11,981 --> 00:43:13,482
Please!

484
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:16,580
We can come back a few times.
Then do it with Peter.

485
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:18,558
They'll be back then.

486
00:43:24,412 --> 00:43:27,537
But only if the house
is on file, which I really doubt.

487
00:43:29,449 --> 00:43:30,949
Agreed.

488
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:39,937
Shit!

489
00:43:39,939 --> 00:43:41,439
What?

490
00:43:41,735 --> 00:43:43,463
- Bingo!
- What?

491
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:46,058
- We've got his alarm system.
- We are going in?

492
00:43:51,844 --> 00:43:54,441
I'll only have 30 seconds
to find the main console.

493
00:43:55,348 --> 00:43:57,596
- We do it Edukators style.
- Agreed.

494
00:45:02,445 --> 00:45:04,897
Once I open the window,
I'll have only 30 seconds.

495
00:45:05,352 --> 00:45:07,106
When the alarm is off,
I'll come for you.

496
00:45:07,861 --> 00:45:09,531
- So I wait here?
- Yes.

497
00:46:12,191 --> 00:46:14,064
Jan, check out the pool.

498
00:46:15,399 --> 00:46:16,871
Come on!

499
00:46:16,872 --> 00:46:18,372
Let's make sure no one's home.

500
00:46:35,235 --> 00:46:36,735
It's OK.

501
00:46:49,654 --> 00:46:51,155
I told you...

502
00:46:51,549 --> 00:46:53,051
petty cash.

503
00:47:00,332 --> 00:47:02,474
- What are you doing?
- Don't panic.

504
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,510
Less conspicuous than a flashlight.

505
00:47:07,963 --> 00:47:09,463
You can take off you mask.

506
00:47:10,367 --> 00:47:11,867
No one's home.

507
00:47:26,925 --> 00:47:28,426
This is him.

508
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:34,879
He needs cooling off.

509
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,280
And vertically?

510
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:07,683
Got it?

511
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:14,354
Awesome!

512
00:48:14,355 --> 00:48:15,855
Looks much better now!

513
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,325
You have too much money.
The Edukators.

514
00:48:30,109 --> 00:48:31,611
OK, let's go.

515
00:48:34,548 --> 00:48:36,877
Come on, Jan.
Let's do something extreme.

516
00:48:38,804 --> 00:48:41,271
I need to work off some aggression.
Please!

517
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:46,545
You're crazy.
We have been here to long.

518
00:48:46,789 --> 00:48:48,359
Let's throw the couch in the pool.

519
00:48:49,616 --> 00:48:51,464
It's a great idea. Come on!

520
00:48:52,759 --> 00:48:54,259
Let's do it!

521
00:48:57,126 --> 00:48:58,626
Then we'll go.

522
00:49:05,073 --> 00:49:06,644
- Will it pass?
- It's hot here.

523
00:49:11,268 --> 00:49:12,768
First things first!

524
00:49:17,027 --> 00:49:18,170
One...

525
00:49:18,171 --> 00:49:19,671
two...

526
00:49:19,715 --> 00:49:21,215
Three!

527
00:49:26,603 --> 00:49:28,104
Come on

528
00:49:32,991 --> 00:49:34,491
Help me.

529
00:49:41,605 --> 00:49:43,105
¡Idiot!

530
00:49:45,172 --> 00:49:46,672
¿What's that?

531
00:49:47,909 --> 00:49:49,643
It's me!
Where from?

532
00:49:50,776 --> 00:49:52,276
Jule, give it back.

533
00:49:53,671 --> 00:49:55,171
Come and get it..

534
00:51:08,052 --> 00:51:10,179
Wait here. I'll be right back.

535
00:51:41,286 --> 00:51:42,788
Don't do this, man.

536
00:52:27,959 --> 00:52:29,459
Jan, let's go now!

537
00:52:29,861 --> 00:52:31,361
Pack our things.

538
00:52:31,683 --> 00:52:33,183
I'll be right back.

539
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:51,086
Got everything?

540
00:52:51,756 --> 00:52:53,256
- Shit!
- What's wrong?

541
00:53:37,316 --> 00:53:38,816
Cops!

542
00:54:11,591 --> 00:54:13,092
That was so awesome!

543
00:54:15,129 --> 00:54:17,584
I'd love to see Hardenberg's face!

544
00:54:17,956 --> 00:54:21,000
when he comes home
and finds his couch in the pool.

545
00:54:51,084 --> 00:54:53,714
It was the best, I tell you.
38 degrees...

546
00:54:55,075 --> 00:54:57,419
the whole city is one big party.

547
00:54:57,878 --> 00:54:59,689
But what was really the best...

548
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:03,630
I found this in Barcelona.

549
00:55:03,955 --> 00:55:05,300
Look.

550
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:06,819
"Strange Edukators...

551
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,200
Nasty surprise for Berlin family,

552
00:55:09,454 --> 00:55:11,130
upon return from vacation,

553
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:14,145
Perpetrators
had broken into their villa.

554
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,201
But nothing was stolen.

555
00:55:16,453 --> 00:55:18,833
Only furniture
and valuables were moved.

556
00:55:19,337 --> 00:55:22,586
Responsibility claimed
in a note signed: The Edukators.

557
00:55:24,055 --> 00:55:27,436
Police still have no solid leads
to their identities".

558
00:55:28,503 --> 00:55:30,003
Which paper?

559
00:55:30,266 --> 00:55:31,766
The Tagesanzeiger.

560
00:55:31,823 --> 00:55:32,734
Super.

561
00:55:32,735 --> 00:55:35,156
I got this for Jule.
Think she'll like it?

562
00:55:37,476 --> 00:55:38,975
It's perfect for her.

563
00:55:40,886 --> 00:55:42,386
Wake up, man.

564
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,824
You seem out of it.

565
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,509
That must be Jule.

566
00:55:58,346 --> 00:55:59,683
How are you?

567
00:55:59,684 --> 00:56:01,184
And you? Everything OK?

568
00:56:01,523 --> 00:56:03,259
I have to tell you something.

569
00:56:05,339 --> 00:56:06,839
Wait... I brought you something.

570
00:56:10,496 --> 00:56:11,996
We have to talk.

571
00:56:14,391 --> 00:56:15,891
I left my phone at the villa.

572
00:56:16,451 --> 00:56:17,951
What? Really?

573
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:22,145
I'm pretty sure.
I know I had it in the car before.

574
00:56:22,394 --> 00:56:24,624
- It's not in my bag anymore.
- Don't tell Peter.

575
00:56:25,818 --> 00:56:27,318
Why not?

576
00:56:28,132 --> 00:56:29,632
Just don't tell him anything.

577
00:56:30,696 --> 00:56:32,198
Look.

578
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:33,804
Isn't it nice?

579
00:56:33,805 --> 00:56:35,306
Try it on.

580
00:57:11,992 --> 00:57:13,492
He really needs a chick.

581
00:57:14,224 --> 00:57:15,724
I'm sure that would help.

582
00:57:18,874 --> 00:57:20,374
Really.

583
00:57:22,102 --> 00:57:25,107
Jan, see her?
She's been checking you out.

584
00:57:25,908 --> 00:57:27,408
Isn't she sweet?

585
00:57:28,622 --> 00:57:30,122
Is she sweet or what?

586
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:33,099
So ask her to dance.

587
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:35,098
Leave him alone.

588
00:57:35,501 --> 00:57:37,002
Want me to ask for you?

589
00:57:38,129 --> 00:57:39,629
I'll ask her.

590
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:51,990
Sleep well.

591
00:57:53,574 --> 00:57:55,074
- You, too.
- Bye.

592
00:58:07,095 --> 00:58:09,702
I'm going for a walk.
I need some air.

593
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,096
Come in, man. Let's have a drink.

594
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:14,035
Put your oxygen on.

595
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,860
Not today.

596
00:58:16,189 --> 00:58:17,767
I'll stay out for a while.

597
00:58:19,426 --> 00:58:20,928
I'm off to bed.

598
00:58:43,861 --> 00:58:45,361
Let's get out here.

599
00:58:46,086 --> 00:58:47,586
I have a bad feeling.

600
00:58:47,797 --> 00:58:49,297
We need to find your phone.

601
00:58:50,816 --> 00:58:54,080
But maybe they already saw
the hole in the window.

602
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:55,952
What would you tell the cops?

603
00:58:56,912 --> 00:58:58,411
Hardenberg know you.

604
00:58:58,579 --> 00:58:59,746
Jan, please.

605
00:58:59,747 --> 00:59:01,332
No. We have to go back in.

606
00:59:02,501 --> 00:59:04,001
Want to go to jail?

607
00:59:19,092 --> 00:59:20,592
It’s not here.

608
00:59:21,431 --> 00:59:22,985
Where was the jacket?

609
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:27,028
- And?
- No.

610
00:59:39,416 --> 00:59:41,240
Let's try calling it.

611
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:50,858
It's on voice mail.
I should've known.

612
01:00:05,032 --> 01:00:08,766
I'll go upstairs.
I have to get rid of fingerprints.

613
01:00:09,156 --> 01:00:10,804
- Hurry!
- I'll be right back.

614
01:00:33,951 --> 01:00:35,451
I just arrived.

615
01:00:37,536 --> 01:00:39,380
Where? Home, of course!

616
01:00:44,001 --> 01:00:46,898
Rita, I didn't drive 700 km
at night to...

617
01:00:51,362 --> 01:00:53,156
I already told you.

618
01:00:53,488 --> 01:00:55,957
Gerling says he needs me.
What could I do?

619
01:00:57,702 --> 01:01:00,629
Like I told you,
in 3 days if all goes well.

620
01:01:02,011 --> 01:01:03,510
Shit!

621
01:01:04,376 --> 01:01:06,807
Theresa left the bathroom light
on again.

622
01:01:15,343 --> 01:01:16,843
Me too.

623
01:01:17,677 --> 01:01:19,177
Say hi to the kids.

624
01:01:19,957 --> 01:01:21,459
Take care, bye.

625
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:38,985
Found it!

626
01:01:40,501 --> 01:01:42,001
What are you doing here?

627
01:01:50,677 --> 01:01:52,177
I know you...

628
01:01:53,977 --> 01:01:55,477
Hold on!

629
01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:25,910
Fucking shit!

630
01:02:32,316 --> 01:02:33,818
Is he alive?

631
01:02:43,812 --> 01:02:45,312
Should we call the medics?

632
01:02:46,274 --> 01:02:47,774
- No.
- Let's just go.

633
01:02:51,375 --> 01:02:52,874
Did he see you?

634
01:02:54,025 --> 01:02:55,525
Yes.

635
01:02:56,546 --> 01:02:57,866
Did he recognize you?

636
01:02:57,868 --> 01:02:59,369
Of course.

637
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,620
Then we can't go.

638
01:03:03,607 --> 01:03:05,589
- Come on.
- We can't just go!

639
01:03:07,251 --> 01:03:08,753
Think hard!

640
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:19,670
- What are we going to do?
- Fucking shit!

641
01:03:22,621 --> 01:03:24,122
Not a clue!

642
01:03:25,061 --> 01:03:26,561
Not a clue, man!

643
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,435
I don't know what to do!

644
01:03:39,678 --> 01:03:41,178
I don't either!

645
01:03:44,949 --> 01:03:46,449
Call Peter.

646
01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:49,930
No.

647
01:03:50,176 --> 01:03:51,676
Why not?

648
01:03:53,643 --> 01:03:55,143
Because, no.

649
01:03:55,855 --> 01:03:57,355
But why not?

650
01:04:06,471 --> 01:04:07,971
You call him. I can't.

651
01:04:09,247 --> 01:04:10,794
- What?
- Just call him!

652
01:04:15,045 --> 01:04:16,545
It can't be...

653
01:04:25,137 --> 01:04:26,637
This is Jule.

654
01:04:27,174 --> 01:04:29,069
Jan and I are in big shit.

655
01:04:29,914 --> 01:04:31,414
We need your help.

656
01:04:31,893 --> 01:04:33,393
Please come right away.

657
01:04:49,629 --> 01:04:51,123
Is this necessary?

658
01:04:51,124 --> 01:04:54,105
Just run away.
The police don't have to know.

659
01:04:55,609 --> 01:04:57,109
I won't say anything.

660
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:06,063
Maybe he won't talk.
Let's just go.

661
01:05:06,418 --> 01:05:07,918
Are you crazy?

662
01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:10,663
That guy lies all day long!

663
01:05:15,517 --> 01:05:17,947
Shit! He dialed the cops.

664
01:05:18,318 --> 01:05:19,818
Did the call go through?

665
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:21,780
We have to go.

666
01:05:22,149 --> 01:05:24,439
- But we...
- We're out of time, OK?

667
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,075
He is coming with us.

668
01:05:27,398 --> 01:05:29,598
Can't we come to a solution?

669
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,381
Shut up!

670
01:05:32,223 --> 01:05:34,151
I won't be a kidnapper!

671
01:05:34,425 --> 01:05:35,925
You can't pull out now!

672
01:05:36,071 --> 01:05:39,766
The cops are coming.
We'll take him and decide later.

673
01:05:39,985 --> 01:05:41,485
End of discussion.

674
01:05:47,197 --> 01:05:48,697
This is crazy!

675
01:05:51,851 --> 01:05:53,352
Open the door.

676
01:06:23,041 --> 01:06:24,541
Come here!

677
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:33,563
Man, what were you thinking?

678
01:06:34,952 --> 01:06:37,943
This was our thing.
You dragged Jule into it.

679
01:06:39,385 --> 01:06:41,773
Why didn’t you tell me sooner?

680
01:06:43,156 --> 01:06:44,656
I don't know.

681
01:06:48,288 --> 01:06:49,787
I just wanted to help.

682
01:07:02,142 --> 01:07:04,006
We won't hurt you, OK?

683
01:07:07,294 --> 01:07:08,793
You can trust me.

684
01:07:33,888 --> 01:07:35,387
OK, drive.

685
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:55,859
Got the flashlight?

686
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:15,682
- Go on!
- Be careful.

687
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,671
It's a 100-meter drop.
Two people were killed last year.

688
01:09:59,573 --> 01:10:01,181
Put the groceries there.

689
01:10:13,893 --> 01:10:15,392
We can sleep in here.

690
01:10:20,751 --> 01:10:22,250
Good.

691
01:10:23,341 --> 01:10:25,274
- A fire?
- Yeah, super.

692
01:10:25,675 --> 01:10:27,349
The matches are up here.

693
01:10:52,891 --> 01:10:54,391
Your uncle comes here often?

694
01:10:54,990 --> 01:10:56,489
Hardly ever.

695
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,579
Does he rent it out?

696
01:11:01,489 --> 01:11:02,989
No.

697
01:11:07,842 --> 01:11:09,628
We say we are on vacation.

698
01:11:10,796 --> 01:11:12,708
In case the forest ranger comes by.

699
01:11:13,754 --> 01:11:15,551
Don't let Hardenberg out.

700
01:12:33,477 --> 01:12:34,976
Good morning.

701
01:12:38,129 --> 01:12:39,629
We'll make it.

702
01:12:40,491 --> 01:12:43,247
I don't know how,
but we'll get out of this.

703
01:12:54,477 --> 01:12:57,339
How about a 70s style
political kidnapping?

704
01:12:58,294 --> 01:13:00,484
We hang a sign around his neck:

705
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,419
"Prisoner of the Edukators"

706
01:13:02,739 --> 01:13:04,239
We tape it for the TV stations.

707
01:13:06,252 --> 01:13:07,852
This is our chance, guys.

708
01:13:08,238 --> 01:13:10,486
Finally a living example
to test our methods.

709
01:13:21,826 --> 01:13:23,455
We need bread, milk and toilet paper.

710
01:13:24,142 --> 01:13:25,642
And a newspaper.

711
01:13:26,502 --> 01:13:28,002
A radio wouldn't be bad.

712
01:13:29,130 --> 01:13:31,497
I'll go down
and check the village.

713
01:13:32,402 --> 01:13:33,931
I'll shop. You guys cook.

714
01:13:35,669 --> 01:13:37,949
- Someone have money?
- Not really.

715
01:13:40,968 --> 01:13:42,738
Hardenberg's buying first round.

716
01:14:06,417 --> 01:14:07,917
How's the People's Prison?

717
01:14:19,453 --> 01:14:20,953
Careful!

718
01:14:38,946 --> 01:14:40,445
What are you expecting?

719
01:14:41,734 --> 01:14:43,233
By reaching so few?

720
01:14:43,833 --> 01:14:45,333
Never heard of:

721
01:14:45,551 --> 01:14:47,050
"Reach one, Educate 100"?

722
01:14:47,203 --> 01:14:48,703
Words get around.

723
01:14:48,733 --> 01:14:50,232
We might get some copycats.

724
01:14:51,621 --> 01:14:53,120
We are just the fuse.

725
01:14:53,593 --> 01:14:55,093
You think you're so much better?

726
01:14:56,195 --> 01:14:59,559
You're not better than terrorists.
You use the same methods...

727
01:14:59,685 --> 01:15:01,396
Spreading fear and panic.

728
01:15:01,744 --> 01:15:03,852
Our goal isn't to be better
at any price.

729
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:07,301
We think it's more original
to have a cause...

730
01:15:08,327 --> 01:15:09,871
To make a difference

731
01:15:11,182 --> 01:15:12,682
Isn't that crazy?

732
01:15:12,789 --> 01:15:15,784
We struggle like crazy
to minimize your damage.

733
01:15:16,292 --> 01:15:17,791
How ungrateful!

734
01:15:18,862 --> 01:15:21,292
Our little break-ins are nothing.

735
01:15:21,525 --> 01:15:23,485
Compared to the violence
used by people like you.

736
01:15:24,448 --> 01:15:26,150
The state legitimizes you.

737
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:28,938
Us...

738
01:15:29,377 --> 01:15:31,249
We get it from ourselves.

739
01:15:31,772 --> 01:15:33,372
So you're Germany's savior?

740
01:15:34,878 --> 01:15:36,781
The new millennium's RAF?

741
01:15:37,096 --> 01:15:38,753
We're not hanging out in pubs

742
01:15:39,218 --> 01:15:41,049
talking about the great revolution.

743
01:15:43,147 --> 01:15:44,646
But it's true...

744
01:15:45,239 --> 01:15:46,981
Serious action makes you vulnerable.

745
01:15:49,354 --> 01:15:50,853
How truly terrible!

746
01:15:53,033 --> 01:15:56,335
Peter, we never discussed it...
How do you endure it all?

747
01:15:57,429 --> 01:15:59,477
Maybe because I'm not
particularly cultivated.

748
01:16:01,732 --> 01:16:04,496
Or maybe because...
I'm just a really cool guy.

749
01:16:08,435 --> 01:16:09,934
What will you do with me?

750
01:16:13,230 --> 01:16:14,752
You'll see soon.

751
01:16:22,154 --> 01:16:23,682
We have 3 possibilities.

752
01:16:23,945 --> 01:16:27,105
Plan A, we make this a kidnapping
and demand ransom money.

753
01:16:27,356 --> 01:16:30,504
At least this shit
will give us money for a new life.

754
01:16:31,569 --> 01:16:35,157
We surely can't go back
to the old one.

755
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:40,672
All in the past, Jule.

756
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:45,667
Plan B...
We put him in the morgue.

757
01:16:48,215 --> 01:16:49,714
Are you crazy?

758
01:16:51,448 --> 01:16:52,947
You've really lost it!

759
01:16:54,297 --> 01:16:56,140
Jule, I'm joking. Calm down.

760
01:16:56,414 --> 01:16:58,643
I've had it with your dumb jokes.

761
01:16:58,938 --> 01:17:00,537
- This is about a human being!
- OK!

762
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:02,916
Bad joke.
I'll be serious.

763
01:17:10,718 --> 01:17:13,715
Plan B, we leave him here
with food for a week.

764
01:17:13,975 --> 01:17:15,584
Then we inform the rangers.

765
01:17:15,972 --> 01:17:18,154
But not before we're far away.

766
01:17:34,902 --> 01:17:36,401
Tea?

767
01:17:46,181 --> 01:17:47,734
What do you earn per year?

768
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:52,793
More or less 200 000.

769
01:17:53,134 --> 01:17:56,058
3.4 million.
That's what I read in Tagesspiegel.

770
01:17:58,361 --> 01:18:01,225
Sounds like more, not less.

771
01:18:03,055 --> 01:18:04,585
Don't you feel guilty?

772
01:18:07,105 --> 01:18:10,845
Ruining a girl's life for a car
worth petty cash to you.

773
01:18:12,706 --> 01:18:14,168
Why?

774
01:18:14,169 --> 01:18:17,661
Alright.
I should have paid more attention

775
01:18:18,589 --> 01:18:20,479
to  who was involved.

776
01:18:21,187 --> 01:18:22,687
I was stressed out.

777
01:18:23,204 --> 01:18:24,703
I'm sorry.

778
01:18:27,143 --> 01:18:28,988
How many hours a day
do you work?

779
01:18:31,507 --> 01:18:33,356
13, 14 hours, easily.

780
01:18:34,532 --> 01:18:36,422
What do you do with all that money?

781
01:18:39,386 --> 01:18:40,885
You amass things.

782
01:18:41,072 --> 01:18:42,572
Big, expensive things.

783
01:18:42,684 --> 01:18:44,809
Fat cars, enormous villa, a yacht...

784
01:18:45,637 --> 01:18:48,515
A lot of stuff to indicate:
"I'm an Alpha Male".

785
01:18:51,408 --> 01:18:53,042
I can't see any other reason.

786
01:18:53,469 --> 01:18:55,293
You don't even have time
to cruise on your yacht.

787
01:18:57,173 --> 01:18:58,877
So why do you always want more?

788
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:02,359
We live in a democracy.

789
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:05,679
I don't have to justify why
I own certain things.

790
01:19:06,032 --> 01:19:07,531
I paid for them.

791
01:19:07,635 --> 01:19:08,892
Wrong!

792
01:19:08,893 --> 01:19:10,599
We live in a capitalist dictatorship.

793
01:19:11,070 --> 01:19:13,008
You stole everything you possess.

794
01:19:13,843 --> 01:19:16,369
I can afford more
because I work more.

795
01:19:17,490 --> 01:19:19,944
I had the right ideas
at the right time.

796
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:21,840
Besides...

797
01:19:24,684 --> 01:19:26,636
I'm not the only one.

798
01:19:28,252 --> 01:19:30,369
Everyone get the same chances.

799
01:19:30,692 --> 01:19:33,126
A real contender, aren't you?

800
01:19:35,486 --> 01:19:38,090
In Southeast Asia, many people work
13, 14 hours per day.

801
01:19:38,933 --> 01:19:41,896
But they don't have villas.
They earn 30 Euros per month.

802
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:45,164
They might have good ideas, too.

803
01:19:45,548 --> 01:19:48,227
But they can't even pay
for a bus ticket to the next town.

804
01:19:49,774 --> 01:19:52,076
Sorry I wasn't born
in Southeast Asia.

805
01:19:53,066 --> 01:19:55,764
But you can still help
make life bearable there.

806
01:19:56,863 --> 01:19:59,716
The First World could cancel
the Third World's debts.

807
01:19:59,957 --> 01:20:02,853
That's only 0.01% of the GNP!

808
01:20:03,249 --> 01:20:06,422
That would collapse
the world's financial system.

809
01:20:06,713 --> 01:20:08,213
You want them poor!

810
01:20:08,671 --> 01:20:10,517
It's the way to control them.

811
01:20:11,255 --> 01:20:13,301
Make them sell their raw goods.

812
01:20:13,729 --> 01:20:15,253
at dirt cheap prices...

813
01:20:15,795 --> 01:20:17,295
What do you know?

814
01:20:17,417 --> 01:20:19,938
Like you didn't cancel Jule's debt.

815
01:20:20,298 --> 01:20:21,775
- That's absurd!
- No.

816
01:20:21,776 --> 01:20:23,337
It's the basic rule of the system.

817
01:20:24,186 --> 01:20:25,686
Suck others dry...

818
01:20:26,950 --> 01:20:29,245
It stops them from reacting.

819
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,059
That's not true.

820
01:20:31,429 --> 01:20:34,089
Sure, things need improvement...

821
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:38,855
Environmental protection,
raising producer prices...

822
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:40,960
But the system won't change.

823
01:20:41,245 --> 01:20:42,744
Why not?

824
01:20:44,269 --> 01:20:45,387
Yes, why not?

825
01:20:45,388 --> 01:20:50,290
The nature of man is
to want to be better than others.

826
01:20:51,205 --> 01:20:54,801
In every group,
a leader emerges quickly.

827
01:20:57,544 --> 01:21:00,802
Plus, most people are happy

828
01:21:01,052 --> 01:21:02,512
only when buying something new.

829
01:21:02,513 --> 01:21:04,013
Happy?

830
01:21:05,259 --> 01:21:06,811
Think they are happy, Hardenberg?

831
01:21:09,970 --> 01:21:12,358
Look around.
Get out of that company car...

832
01:21:12,641 --> 01:21:14,152
Walk on the street!

833
01:21:14,429 --> 01:21:17,033
Anyone look happy?
Or more like scared animals?

834
01:21:19,536 --> 01:21:21,587
Look into their living rooms.

835
01:21:22,009 --> 01:21:23,610
All glued to the TV...

836
01:21:24,701 --> 01:21:26,482
Listening to chick zombies...

837
01:21:26,761 --> 01:21:28,261
speaking of a happiness long gone.

838
01:21:30,204 --> 01:21:31,704
Drive around town.

839
01:21:32,607 --> 01:21:34,944
You'll see all the filth,
the overcrowding...

840
01:21:36,303 --> 01:21:38,072
The masses in department stores...

841
01:21:38,339 --> 01:21:39,995
Up and down,
like robots on escalators.

842
01:21:40,837 --> 01:21:42,379
Nobody knows anybody.

843
01:21:43,504 --> 01:21:45,638
They think
Happiness is an inch away.

844
01:21:45,937 --> 01:21:48,093
But it's unreachable,
because you stole it.

845
01:21:50,189 --> 01:21:51,688
That's how it is.

846
01:21:51,937 --> 01:21:53,436
You know perfectly well.

847
01:21:59,439 --> 01:22:00,944
But I have news for you,
executive...

848
01:22:02,328 --> 01:22:03,827
The system is overheated.

849
01:22:04,609 --> 01:22:07,520
We're just forerunners.
Your time is almost over.

850
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:10,910
Swim in you shit technology,
but others are full of rage.

851
01:22:11,877 --> 01:22:14,198
The rage of children living in slums,

852
01:22:14,451 --> 01:22:16,189
watching American action films.

853
01:22:16,564 --> 01:22:18,458
That's one part. Let's see...

854
01:22:18,808 --> 01:22:20,512
Mental illness is rising.

855
01:22:20,867 --> 01:22:23,799
Serial killers, shattered souls,
senseless violence...

856
01:22:24,361 --> 01:22:26,600
You can't sedate them
with game shows and shopping.

857
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:30,190
The antidepressants
won't work forever either.

858
01:22:32,199 --> 01:22:34,506
The people have had enough
of you shit system.

859
01:22:39,341 --> 01:22:43,192
I admit some of what you say is true.

860
01:22:45,262 --> 01:22:47,434
But I'm the wrong scapegoat.

861
01:22:47,743 --> 01:22:50,164
I play the game,
but I didn’t make up the rules.

862
01:22:50,967 --> 01:22:54,091
It’s not who invented the gun,
but who pulls the trigger.

863
01:23:01,709 --> 01:23:05,016
I'll be in the kitchen...
Washing dishes.

864
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,380
You know, it's not that simple.

865
01:23:26,552 --> 01:23:28,277
You don't get off that easily.

866
01:24:56,785 --> 01:25:00,470
It's an island in the Mediterranean.
Practically no guards.

867
01:25:04,921 --> 01:25:08,364
It's the control center
for Europe’s 13 main satellites.

868
01:25:09,734 --> 01:25:12,146
If the transmitter is sabotaged,

869
01:25:12,461 --> 01:25:15,329
every TV screen in Europe
will go black.

870
01:25:16,952 --> 01:25:19,244
There's a fairly simple way.

871
01:25:21,355 --> 01:25:23,277
I came up with it myself.

872
01:25:25,262 --> 01:25:27,084
It's easier than you think.

873
01:25:43,954 --> 01:25:45,453
Can I have a toke?

874
01:26:05,070 --> 01:26:07,356
I thought people like you
hated dope heads.

875
01:26:08,263 --> 01:26:09,618
People like me?

876
01:26:09,619 --> 01:26:11,668
Yeah, people like you.

877
01:26:14,399 --> 01:26:16,128
You think I was born this way?

878
01:26:19,494 --> 01:26:22,500
You probably weren't loved enough
as a child.

879
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:35,646
I don't agree with you what you’re doing,
but your arguments...

880
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:40,269
They remind me of another time.

881
01:26:45,047 --> 01:26:46,546
Give us a history lesson!

882
01:26:49,788 --> 01:26:51,814
Well, we did make history.

883
01:26:53,988 --> 01:26:55,956
68 was a wild time.

884
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:58,630
I looked different then.

885
01:27:00,637 --> 01:27:02,828
Long curly hair...

886
01:27:03,384 --> 01:27:06,388
old leather jacket,
bell bottom pants...

887
01:27:06,642 --> 01:27:08,141
Always a cap...

888
01:27:08,609 --> 01:27:10,109
A true rebel.

889
01:27:10,288 --> 01:27:12,194
Must have been long ago!

890
01:27:17,064 --> 01:27:20,133
Turbulent times...
I was one of the leaders of the SDS.

891
01:27:21,041 --> 01:27:23,046
Rudi Dutschke
was a good friend of mine.

892
01:27:27,539 --> 01:27:29,050
Who was chairman?

893
01:27:29,327 --> 01:27:31,435
K.D. Wolf, Karl Dietrich Wolf.

894
01:27:31,643 --> 01:27:32,536
Number 2?

895
01:27:32,537 --> 01:27:34,137
His brother, Frank Wolf.

896
01:27:35,890 --> 01:27:38,383
This morning
was a far cry for revolt.

897
01:27:39,363 --> 01:27:43,078
Yeah...It's been a while...

898
01:27:46,599 --> 01:27:48,098
30 years ago.

899
01:27:49,723 --> 01:27:52,756
We would have liked to get hold
of a big shot like me.

900
01:27:53,091 --> 01:27:54,590
And today, here I am!

901
01:27:59,088 --> 01:28:00,823
Pretty funny.

902
01:28:05,249 --> 01:28:07,083
I don't want to kiss up to you.

903
01:28:07,731 --> 01:28:09,644
And I don't think it's right
what you're doing to me.

904
01:28:11,426 --> 01:28:12,953
But your idealism...

905
01:28:15,344 --> 01:28:16,844
I can respect that.

906
01:28:55,159 --> 01:28:56,659
Morning.

907
01:29:00,847 --> 01:29:02,347
Everything OK?

908
01:29:02,484 --> 01:29:03,983
Yes, fine.

909
01:29:06,856 --> 01:29:08,355
Pass me the jam, please.

910
01:29:09,945 --> 01:29:11,444
This one.

911
01:29:11,926 --> 01:29:13,468
Can I have some bread?

912
01:29:17,277 --> 01:29:20,672
It's in my interest
that things go problem-free.

913
01:29:20,991 --> 01:29:23,110
So i have a suggestion.

914
01:29:25,066 --> 01:29:27,411
I must make a call before 16:00

915
01:29:27,858 --> 01:29:29,586
Our cleaning woman
mustn't go in the house.

916
01:29:30,802 --> 01:29:32,937
Or she'll see the window.

917
01:29:33,346 --> 01:29:36,153
There's no network.
And cell phones can be traced.

918
01:29:36,729 --> 01:29:39,886
I'll drive him down to the village.
There's a phone booth.

919
01:29:42,468 --> 01:29:43,967
He'll run away.

920
01:29:46,899 --> 01:29:50,572
If he tries,
I'll shoot him in the leg.

921
01:29:53,398 --> 01:29:55,431
That won't be necessary.
I won't run away.

922
01:29:56,130 --> 01:29:57,629
I won't scream for help.

923
01:29:58,587 --> 01:30:02,429
I don't have a secret code
with the maid, in case of kidnapping.

924
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:08,120
And I have to call my wife.
If not, she'll make a fuss.

925
01:30:09,401 --> 01:30:11,242
Peter, can we talk?

926
01:30:17,238 --> 01:30:18,737
What's that about?

927
01:30:20,714 --> 01:30:22,550
Just a gas pistol I bought.

928
01:30:23,072 --> 01:30:24,688
It's not loaded and it's broken.

929
01:30:25,224 --> 01:30:26,786
It looks like real to a cop.

930
01:30:27,165 --> 01:30:28,934
Jule called
in the middle of the night.

931
01:30:29,902 --> 01:30:32,094
So I brought it with me.
It sounded like an emergency.

932
01:30:34,732 --> 01:30:39,808
We could forget all that business
about the accident.

933
01:30:42,216 --> 01:30:44,793
I could draw up a document
to end it.

934
01:30:48,491 --> 01:30:51,139
I don't think this phone thing
is going to work.

935
01:30:52,252 --> 01:30:54,642
- Us three with a 50-year-old...
- Forget it.

936
01:30:56,044 --> 01:30:58,619
The streets are dead at noon.
OK?

937
01:30:59,133 --> 01:31:00,633
And if he screams?

938
01:31:01,303 --> 01:31:03,128
He won't.
not with my gun in his side.

939
01:31:05,783 --> 01:31:08,646
We have no choice...
The maid can't go inside.

940
01:31:09,305 --> 01:31:10,804
There's not just the whole in the window.

941
01:31:12,602 --> 01:31:13,757
Come on.

942
01:31:13,758 --> 01:31:15,258
But give me the gun.

943
01:31:17,701 --> 01:31:19,201
I'll do it.

944
01:31:27,849 --> 01:31:31,585
I didn't bother with it
because I'm always on the move.

945
01:31:31,999 --> 01:31:33,499
I gave it to my lawyer.

946
01:31:33,945 --> 01:31:35,953
It was business as usual for him.

947
01:31:36,373 --> 01:31:40,129
Nobody knew to what extent
it would affect someone.

948
01:31:40,381 --> 01:31:43,459
You think I'm the weakest link here?

949
01:31:43,781 --> 01:31:45,970
Think I'll buy all your bullshit?

950
01:31:46,790 --> 01:31:49,151
But this is about
more than the damn accident!

951
01:32:12,447 --> 01:32:13,947
Where are the keys?

952
01:32:15,230 --> 01:32:16,730
Check in my jacket.

953
01:33:00,972 --> 01:33:02,472
Don't do anything stupid.

954
01:33:35,266 --> 01:33:37,671
It's Mr. Hardenberg...
Hello Mrs. Rose.

955
01:33:38,707 --> 01:33:40,207
Yes, thank you.

956
01:33:40,427 --> 01:33:42,336
No need to come today.

957
01:33:42,569 --> 01:33:45,465
I came home earlier
to work in peace.

958
01:33:46,284 --> 01:33:48,721
I have some business to finish.

959
01:33:49,484 --> 01:33:51,363
Please come next Wednesday.

960
01:33:51,769 --> 01:33:53,799
I'll call you on Tuesday.

961
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:59,156
Good, same to you. Thank you.

962
01:33:59,910 --> 01:34:01,410
Bye.

963
01:34:03,447 --> 01:34:04,947
- Now my wife?
- Yes.

964
01:34:14,596 --> 01:34:15,745
It's me.

965
01:34:15,746 --> 01:34:17,246
I had...

966
01:34:17,377 --> 01:34:19,769
Hold on...
A water pipe burst last night.

967
01:34:20,745 --> 01:34:23,080
It was a big mess.
I had to call a plumber.

968
01:34:24,526 --> 01:34:27,692
No... everything is fine now.

969
01:34:27,953 --> 01:34:29,453
But I couldn't call before.

970
01:34:29,877 --> 01:34:31,376
Yes, on Monday.

971
01:34:31,443 --> 01:34:33,471
At least, I hope on Monday...

972
01:34:34,713 --> 01:34:36,212
I'll call you.

973
01:34:38,994 --> 01:34:40,493
Kisses from me.

974
01:34:41,414 --> 01:34:42,913
Bye.

975
01:34:44,038 --> 01:34:46,109
Good...
You're a good liar.

976
01:34:49,658 --> 01:34:51,158
It's a sauna in there.

977
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:52,891
Bad cell phone reception.

978
01:34:52,901 --> 01:34:54,401
Yeah, my son is in withdrawal.

979
01:35:00,387 --> 01:35:01,886
Alright, let's go.

980
01:35:04,547 --> 01:35:06,083
You heard... Drive.

981
01:35:42,754 --> 01:35:44,481
I guess it’s been a while...

982
01:35:45,053 --> 01:35:46,606
Since you did your own wash.

983
01:35:52,660 --> 01:35:55,218
How can someone with your past
live the way you do?

984
01:35:57,689 --> 01:35:59,409
You must have had ideals.

985
01:36:01,521 --> 01:36:04,895
My father told me:
"Under 30 and not liberal, no heart.

986
01:36:05,178 --> 01:36:07,208
"Over 30 and still liberal,
no brain.

987
01:36:07,602 --> 01:36:09,101
Yeah, right.

988
01:36:09,327 --> 01:36:10,959
But I don't believe that crap.

989
01:36:14,569 --> 01:36:16,808
It's the standard excuse
of guys like you.

990
01:36:20,980 --> 01:36:23,866
It happened slowly, gradually.
you hardly notice it.

991
01:36:24,166 --> 01:36:26,247
One day, you abandon your old car.

992
01:36:26,536 --> 01:36:29,231
You want a dependable car,
with air conditioning, a warranty.

993
01:36:30,632 --> 01:36:33,312
You get married,
raise a family, buy a house...

994
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:38,355
The kids need a good education.
That costs money... Security!

995
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:42,028
You create endless debts,
so you need a career to pay them.

996
01:36:42,589 --> 01:36:44,678
So you do like they do.

997
01:36:45,027 --> 01:36:47,295
Then one day,
to your surprise at the polls...

998
01:36:49,352 --> 01:36:50,852
You vote conservative.

999
01:37:46,847 --> 01:37:48,401
Who made this great pasta?

1000
01:37:48,933 --> 01:37:50,432
Me..

1001
01:37:51,482 --> 01:37:52,981
Respect.

1002
01:37:53,306 --> 01:37:54,806
Thanks.

1003
01:37:55,606 --> 01:37:57,105
Who cooks at your house?

1004
01:37:57,394 --> 01:37:58,894
Your wife?

1005
01:37:59,829 --> 01:38:01,329
Mrs. Schwarz.

1006
01:38:02,325 --> 01:38:03,825
Our cook.

1007
01:38:07,010 --> 01:38:09,110
Before, I used to love to cook.

1008
01:38:09,613 --> 01:38:12,177
For my wife and I,
the others in the commune.

1009
01:38:14,302 --> 01:38:15,801
Like big parties.

1010
01:38:16,369 --> 01:38:17,868
How many where you?

1011
01:38:18,764 --> 01:38:20,264
We were 6.

1012
01:38:22,178 --> 01:38:23,677
Rolf, Bernard, I,

1013
01:38:23,934 --> 01:38:26,239
Lizzy, Gabi, my wife.

1014
01:38:27,521 --> 01:38:29,311
First, Rolf and Gabi were together.

1015
01:38:30,231 --> 01:38:32,480
Then, Bernd and Gabi,
then Lizzy and me.

1016
01:38:33,135 --> 01:38:36,174
Then Bernd and Lizzy...

1017
01:38:38,588 --> 01:38:41,545
Then Lizzy and my wife
for a while...

1018
01:38:43,110 --> 01:38:47,289
It wasn't just a political movement.

1019
01:38:47,638 --> 01:38:49,137
We had fun.

1020
01:38:51,177 --> 01:38:54,953
Free love...
But I don't have to tell you three.

1021
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:06,100
You skip.

1022
01:39:07,832 --> 01:39:09,332
Skip again.

1023
01:39:10,577 --> 01:39:12,077
I'll draw 2.

1024
01:39:14,056 --> 01:39:15,556
Funny.

1025
01:39:19,978 --> 01:39:21,180
I pass.

1026
01:39:23,704 --> 01:39:25,203
I don't care.

1027
01:39:25,614 --> 01:39:27,523
- You make the rules.
- Yes, I do.

1028
01:39:36,699 --> 01:39:38,198
When I was little...

1029
01:39:39,891 --> 01:39:41,390
with my friends...

1030
01:39:43,096 --> 01:39:45,418
we played house with dolls...

1031
01:39:48,557 --> 01:39:52,482
It was so real for them.
They were so into it.

1032
01:39:54,751 --> 01:39:57,893
I was never able to forget
they were only dolls.

1033
01:40:00,818 --> 01:40:02,317
I always felt like...

1034
01:40:03,288 --> 01:40:06,429
More of a watcher than a player.

1035
01:40:06,833 --> 01:40:08,332
You know?

1036
01:40:11,486 --> 01:40:12,986
I still feel like that.

1037
01:40:14,955 --> 01:40:16,455
In real life.

1038
01:40:19,074 --> 01:40:20,573
It's the Matrix.

1039
01:40:22,546 --> 01:40:24,719
If you see it,
you can't be living in it.

1040
01:40:29,082 --> 01:40:30,581
Neither can I.

1041
01:41:01,812 --> 01:41:03,312
Good morning.

1042
01:41:04,824 --> 01:41:06,324
Someone has to grocery shop.

1043
01:41:06,494 --> 01:41:08,146
We're out of coffee, wine...

1044
01:41:08,511 --> 01:41:10,696
No more food,
no more toilet paper...

1045
01:41:12,567 --> 01:41:15,189
I can't anymore.
It's your turn.

1046
01:41:17,038 --> 01:41:18,538
I'll go.

1047
01:41:18,554 --> 01:41:20,053
I'll go with you.

1048
01:41:34,396 --> 01:41:35,896
There's no more dope!

1049
01:41:38,521 --> 01:41:40,021
Ask in the store!

1050
01:41:48,149 --> 01:41:50,653
Hardi, how about a game of cards?

1051
01:42:33,031 --> 01:42:34,531
Awesome.

1052
01:42:49,089 --> 01:42:50,589
Let's go in.

1053
01:42:56,205 --> 01:42:57,704
It's cold.

1054
01:43:31,135 --> 01:43:32,862
I thought...

1055
01:43:34,676 --> 01:43:37,802
money would bring freedom.

1056
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:41,364
On the contrary.

1057
01:43:42,213 --> 01:43:44,155
You're burdened with responsibility.

1058
01:43:45,127 --> 01:43:47,398
Sometimes I feel like I'm in jail.

1059
01:43:47,874 --> 01:43:49,359
Stop moaning.

1060
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:51,852
Isn't 3 million a year
enough compensation?

1061
01:43:54,636 --> 01:43:57,178
I don't know what to do
with the money.

1062
01:43:57,493 --> 01:43:59,166
Give it to those who need it.

1063
01:44:00,369 --> 01:44:04,156
With your annual salary
you could save 1000 persons

1064
01:44:04,415 --> 01:44:05,914
from starvation.

1065
01:44:06,185 --> 01:44:07,993
Sounds corny, but it's true.

1066
01:44:08,334 --> 01:44:09,834
I could do that.

1067
01:44:10,026 --> 01:44:11,525
But only once.

1068
01:44:12,072 --> 01:44:13,572
So do it!

1069
01:44:15,641 --> 01:44:17,883
To be honest, Peter...

1070
01:44:18,671 --> 01:44:21,055
I've thought of giving it all up.

1071
01:44:21,316 --> 01:44:24,855
Just sell everything,
move to the countryside...

1072
01:44:26,023 --> 01:44:30,483
Live modestly with my wife,
both of us work as teachers..

1073
01:44:32,026 --> 01:44:34,576
Like when we were students.

1074
01:44:35,315 --> 01:44:36,891
Poor but happy.

1075
01:44:37,741 --> 01:44:39,240
We were in love.

1076
01:44:41,397 --> 01:44:43,716
When you talked about free love,

1077
01:44:44,096 --> 01:44:46,512
why mention the three of us?

1078
01:44:49,955 --> 01:44:51,454
Don't know it?

1079
01:45:29,564 --> 01:45:31,108
You bought them anyway!

1080
01:45:32,852 --> 01:45:34,478
They are disgusting.

1081
01:45:34,762 --> 01:45:36,262
They are for Hardenberg.

1082
01:45:56,168 --> 01:45:57,668
You two got something going?

1083
01:46:05,957 --> 01:46:07,457
Have you lost it?

1084
01:46:08,886 --> 01:46:11,709
Kiss my ass! This is your shit.
I'm out of here.

1085
01:46:16,285 --> 01:46:17,784
¡Peter, I’m sorry!

1086
01:46:17,818 --> 01:46:19,318
Sorry for what?

1087
01:46:20,669 --> 01:46:22,169
It just happened.

1088
01:46:26,552 --> 01:46:28,052
I fell in love.

1089
01:46:35,135 --> 01:46:36,634
Good, then I can go.

1090
01:46:47,251 --> 01:46:48,750
You don't love me anymore.

1091
01:47:37,812 --> 01:47:39,312
You bastard!

1092
01:47:39,371 --> 01:47:40,870
What were you thinking, man?

1093
01:47:44,102 --> 01:47:45,493
We hit it off, sorry.

1094
01:47:45,494 --> 01:47:47,228
Hit it off? Just like that?

1095
01:47:48,023 --> 01:47:50,024
Not "just like that".
We got to know each other.

1096
01:47:50,786 --> 01:47:52,271
I thought we were friends.

1097
01:47:52,272 --> 01:47:53,920
- We are friends.
- I trusted you!

1098
01:47:55,591 --> 01:47:57,184
You told me to help her!

1099
01:47:57,417 --> 01:47:58,916
Help her, not fuck her.

1100
01:48:02,832 --> 01:48:04,332
Asshole!

1101
01:48:14,128 --> 01:48:15,628
Coffee?

1102
01:48:16,499 --> 01:48:17,998
No, thanks.

1103
01:48:24,076 --> 01:48:25,607
Can I help you?

1104
01:48:29,122 --> 01:48:30,621
No, forget it.

1105
01:48:36,882 --> 01:48:40,118
I'm going to lie down.
I'm a little tired.

1106
01:49:27,569 --> 01:49:29,068
The keys!

1107
01:53:38,021 --> 01:53:39,521
We screwed up.

1108
01:53:45,118 --> 01:53:47,400
Kidnapping Hardenberg was wrong.

1109
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:54,160
We did it to save our own asses,
not the world.

1110
01:56:04,826 --> 01:56:06,326
I guess this is it.

1111
01:56:10,592 --> 01:56:12,091
Thanks for driving me home.

1112
01:56:16,490 --> 01:56:18,337
Don't worry about the cops.

1113
01:56:25,161 --> 01:56:26,660
Wait!

1114
01:56:28,108 --> 01:56:29,607
Your sweater.

1115
01:56:37,272 --> 01:56:38,771
Here.

1116
01:56:39,521 --> 01:56:41,021
This is for you.

1117
01:56:47,961 --> 01:56:49,461
Waiver of Debt.

1118
01:56:50,515 --> 01:56:52,014
I won't ruin your life.

1119
01:58:12,739 --> 01:58:14,238
What's wrong?

1120
01:58:14,347 --> 01:58:15,847
Nothing.

1121
01:58:22,470 --> 01:58:24,532
After what I did,
I can't make demands.

1122
01:58:25,687 --> 01:58:27,186
It’s over.

1123
01:58:30,341 --> 01:58:32,349
Talk like that,
and you're one of them.

1124
01:58:37,974 --> 01:58:42,024
It's not the Jule thing that hurt.
It’s that you take me for an idiot.

1125
01:58:43,739 --> 01:58:47,369
If I pocket a Rolex,
that's not an insult to our case.

1126
01:58:49,026 --> 01:58:50,526
I believe in it, man.

1127
01:59:01,723 --> 01:59:05,364
Us three... That's more important
than stuffy bourgeois ethics.

1128
01:59:08,927 --> 01:59:10,489
The best ideas survive.

1129
01:59:18,587 --> 01:59:21,073
Come on.

1130
02:01:34,676 --> 02:01:43,937
Some People Never Change.
