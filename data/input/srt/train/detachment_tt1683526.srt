1
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,147
Let's, uhm... Let's not have
people come in.

2
00:00:16,157 --> 00:00:19,004
I'd like to do this without
anybody in here.

3
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:21,059
Could everybody split, that
doesn't have to be here. Thanks.

4
00:00:21,069 --> 00:00:23,125
- Maybe we can keep...
- And close the door.

5
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:25,802
- Keep people away from the door.
- Is that good?

6
00:00:25,822 --> 00:00:27,366
Yep. Thank you

7
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:45,954
"And never have I felt so
deeply at one and the same time

8
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:53,945
so detached from myself
and so present in the world"

(Albert Camus)
French philosopher and writer

10
00:01:13,494 --> 00:01:15,524
"For Henry"

11
00:01:25,197 --> 00:01:28,418
I wasn't good in school.
I didn't care for school.

12
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:32,558
Uhm ... It was nice socially,
my own experience, but

13
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:33,888
I kinda just went along...

14
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:36,959
I started off as a music major.

15
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:39,399
I was gonna be
a Rock 'n' Roll star.

16
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,000
But that didn't quite
work out.

17
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,980
In 1985,

18
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,191
during a hurricane,
hurricane Gloria,

19
00:01:46,851 --> 00:01:49,931
I was walk... I was taking
a train into the city to work.

20
00:01:49,971 --> 00:01:53,982
I'd gotten to work and I was on
the phone with my brother-in-law,

21
00:01:54,182 --> 00:01:57,182
who had just
started teaching,

22
00:01:57,453 --> 00:01:59,263
and he said that he was
off from school.

23
00:01:59,483 --> 00:02:00,683
Now, now,
wait a second,

24
00:02:00,683 --> 00:02:02,483
You're off from school
for hurricane

25
00:02:02,493 --> 00:02:05,494
and I'm goin' into the city
to work in an Office building?

26
00:02:05,534 --> 00:02:08,584
I said: "Woa, that's a
pretty good kick, right."

27
00:02:09,805 --> 00:02:14,055
My mom was a teacher and I knew
without a shadow of a doubt

28
00:02:14,115 --> 00:02:17,086
from early childhood that
the one job I would never do

29
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:20,066
was become a teacher.

30
00:02:19,136 --> 00:02:22,767
Never ever I would take
toll cards on a turnpike.

31
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:26,698
I'd be a shepard, anything,
rather than become a teacher.

32
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,398
I decided to become a teacher
because I wanted to do

33
00:02:30,408 --> 00:02:32,338
something with my life besides
what I was doing

34
00:02:32,348 --> 00:02:35,089
which was driving a truck,
for a company and,

35
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,889
I decided I wanted to do
a little bit better for myself

36
00:02:37,899 --> 00:02:39,340
so I got into teaching
a little bit.

37
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,990
I went back to school
at the age of 37.

38
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,061
A friend of mine from college...

39
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:47,011
His aunt was the...

40
00:02:47,021 --> 00:02:49,311
Principle of an all-girls
inner city school

41
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:52,842
in Newark, New Jersey, and
they were desperate for teachers

42
00:02:52,992 --> 00:02:55,842
So, I thought "Great,
I can do this for a year,

43
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,193
it'll keep my father from making
me get a job at Prudential,

44
00:02:59,243 --> 00:03:03,334
and then I'll figure out
what I wanna do."

45
00:03:05,994 --> 00:03:08,495
Well, they called me up
asking me to go to an interview,

46
00:03:08,835 --> 00:03:10,835
and I happened to get an job

47
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:12,955
in a Junior High school,
in Queens,

48
00:03:13,245 --> 00:03:15,436
and I ended up...

49
00:03:15,676 --> 00:03:19,707
starting it at my...
What's now?... my 30th year.

50
00:03:23,197 --> 00:03:26,798
Most of the teachers here,
at one point...

51
00:03:28,148 --> 00:03:30,508
...they believed...,

52
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,949
that they could
make a difference

53
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,750
You know, I know
how important it is to

54
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:42,000
have guidance and to have

55
00:03:45,261 --> 00:03:49,042
someone help understand
the complexities

56
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:50,782
of the world
that we live in.

57
00:03:50,802 --> 00:03:55,673
I didn't really have that
growing up.

58
00:04:00,013 --> 00:04:16,856
Producers:

59
00:04:18,707 --> 00:04:24,208
Written by:

60
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:29,048
Directed by:

61
00:04:29,809 --> 00:04:32,219
I am money.

62
00:04:32,859 --> 00:04:35,820
I change hands
like a dollar bill

63
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:40,850
that's been robbed
by a lamp

64
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,941
when a genie appeared
and cried loudly, with volume.

65
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:46,501
But the tears were
all for myself.

66
00:04:46,761 --> 00:04:49,512
And that's where it
all went wrong.

67
00:05:21,957 --> 00:05:24,148
Hi, Lupe, Dean Vargas here.

68
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:28,699
I'm sick and I won't be
coming in today, allright?

69
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:35,940
Get to the point, Dr. Heart.
I've got a school to run.

70
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,580
The State's score have gone
down in the last three years.

71
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,511
- You're not delivering... - Don't pretend
like you don't know the game.

72
00:05:40,521 --> 00:05:42,721
You earmarked my school
as the transfer dome

73
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:45,231
for the worst kids in
the district.

74
00:05:44,821 --> 00:05:46,522
Well, kids deserve an education,
don't you agree?

75
00:05:46,532 --> 00:05:48,862
I agree you're jerking of
and wasting my time.

76
00:05:48,872 --> 00:05:51,743
- Get to the point, Dr. Heart...
- We need consensus builders.

77
00:05:51,873 --> 00:05:54,973
- New methodology.
- You're corportizing the system.

78
00:05:55,003 --> 00:05:57,774
No, we're cleaning house.

79
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:01,024
Our superintendent feels that
it's time your stepped down.

80
00:06:01,124 --> 00:06:04,425
Babe, you got some fuckin'
nerve coming into my yard

81
00:06:04,435 --> 00:06:06,025
with the heart fuckin' self.

82
00:06:06,035 --> 00:06:09,526
Carol, there was a time
when you were an educator.

83
00:06:09,906 --> 00:06:12,826
You were very well respected.

84
00:06:13,026 --> 00:06:16,727
Why don't you go
out on top?

85
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:29,209
Oi!

86
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:31,629
Everybody sit down
and shut up,

87
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:34,690
or I'll start pulling out
the referrals.

88
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:35,790
Sit!

89
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,320
Sit down!

90
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,051
I am starting the DVD.

91
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,861
I am starting the DVD.

92
00:07:07,906 --> 00:07:10,196
- Barth or Barthes
- Barth. Mr. Barth.

93
00:07:10,651 --> 00:07:12,110
Mr. Barth Henry

94
00:07:12,986 --> 00:07:15,527
So you've taken long term
assignments at the

95
00:07:15,527 --> 00:07:17,807
"Lock and McArthur"?

96
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,157
The Fringe.

97
00:07:19,568 --> 00:07:21,588
Well, that's... That's...

98
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:26,289
This a month-long assignment,
until I can fill it permanently.

99
00:07:26,549 --> 00:07:28,439
I asked to meet with you
because you come

100
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:32,640
highly recommended as the
best sub on the call sheet.

101
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,240
That's a somewhat
dubious endorsement.

102
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,441
I agree, Mr. Barth.

103
00:07:38,441 --> 00:07:40,931
You'll find many of your
students functioning

104
00:07:40,941 --> 00:07:45,942
well below grade level.

105
00:07:42,431 --> 00:07:45,092
That's your task to try
and get them caught up.

106
00:07:45,112 --> 00:07:47,992
Teach the Curriculum,
most importantly.

107
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:49,693
Understood?

108
00:08:03,628 --> 00:08:06,449
- Good morning
- Good morning

109
00:08:06,847 --> 00:08:07,926
I'm Mr. Barth

110
00:08:08,296 --> 00:08:11,166
Those of you who haven't
heard, this is English 11 A.

111
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:12,221
- Yes
- Yeah

112
00:08:12,217 --> 00:08:14,047
Listen up, I have one rule.

113
00:08:14,951 --> 00:08:15,760
Just one.

114
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:18,848
If you don't wish to be here

115
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,498
don't come.

116
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:22,348
Dude, what does that mean?

117
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:24,939
It's not dude, it's Mr. Barth.

118
00:08:25,049 --> 00:08:26,559
The S is silent.

119
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,759
- You're fuckin' gay.
- Marcus, shut up!

120
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:30,600
No, you shut up!

121
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,780
You diet Bitch!

122
00:08:36,441 --> 00:08:37,531
Hey, Marcus.

123
00:08:38,511 --> 00:08:39,431
Guess what.

124
00:08:39,551 --> 00:08:40,651
What?

125
00:08:40,651 --> 00:08:41,802
You're free to leave.

126
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,902
- Like right now?
- Like right now.

127
00:08:43,912 --> 00:08:46,852
- Hiya...
- See you later, man.

128
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:49,863
- What's the fuck? You want me
to go to the Dean's Office?

129
00:08:49,683 --> 00:08:52,103
- I don't care where you go.

130
00:08:52,163 --> 00:08:53,814
Everyone pull out
a sheet of paper.

131
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:56,074
I'd like to assess what your
individual writing skills are.

132
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:57,854
What if we got no paper?

133
00:08:57,874 --> 00:09:00,555
Okay here is the situation.
You're dead.

134
00:09:00,575 --> 00:09:03,505
- Alright, write an brief
but detailed essay about...

135
00:09:03,515 --> 00:09:05,956
- Hey jackass! I asked you
a fucking question!

136
00:09:05,926 --> 00:09:09,006
...about what a friend
or a parent

137
00:09:09,056 --> 00:09:12,067
might say about you
during your funeral. OK?

138
00:09:12,857 --> 00:09:15,237
- You have 30 minutes.
- Oh, shit...

139
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:20,688
I asked you a motherfuckin'
question, didn't I?

140
00:09:28,925 --> 00:09:29,996
Anything else?

141
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,241
You'd better back the fuck up
before I fuckin' wreck your shit.

142
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:38,571
That bag,

143
00:09:38,841 --> 00:09:43,492
It doesn't have any feelings.
It's empty.

144
00:09:43,122 --> 00:09:46,563
I don't have any feelings
you can hurt either. OK?

145
00:09:46,963 --> 00:09:49,553
I understand you're angry.

146
00:09:49,863 --> 00:09:53,314
I used to be very
angry too, OK. I get it.

147
00:09:53,324 --> 00:09:55,814
You have no reason to be
angry with me, because

148
00:09:55,824 --> 00:09:59,215
I am one of the few people that's
here trying to give you an opportunity.

149
00:09:59,245 --> 00:10:00,835
Now I am going to ask you,

150
00:10:00,835 --> 00:10:04,566
you just sit down,
and do your best,

151
00:10:04,576 --> 00:10:08,566
and I'll give you a piece
of paper. How's that?

152
00:10:13,387 --> 00:10:16,658
Can I get a fuckin' pen too?

153
00:10:17,588 --> 00:10:21,159
Kids don't have any
attention span. They're bored.

154
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:25,069
So how are you supposed to
reel them in with classic literature

155
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:32,411
if they don't believe
that you

156
00:10:33,021 --> 00:10:36,091
have something meaningful
to share.

157
00:10:40,322 --> 00:10:43,392
Thank you.

158
00:10:46,053 --> 00:10:49,473
Why did you throw Marcus
out of class but not Jerry?

159
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:52,074
Well I had to make an
example out of somebody.

160
00:10:52,474 --> 00:10:54,424
You know, Marcus verbally
assaulted you,

161
00:10:54,424 --> 00:10:56,275
and that's not allowed
in my classroom.

162
00:10:56,285 --> 00:10:59,235
And, what they say to me
isn't material.

163
00:11:00,075 --> 00:11:02,096
What's your name?

164
00:11:02,146 --> 00:11:03,216
Meredith.

165
00:11:03,926 --> 00:11:06,206
Nice to meet you, Meredith.

166
00:11:06,696 --> 00:11:10,077
So you really don't care
what the kids say to you?

167
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,307
Perhaps I've gotten
used to it.

168
00:11:12,427 --> 00:11:13,978
I wish I could be
that strong.

169
00:11:13,988 --> 00:11:17,278
It doesn't take strength,
Meredith. You gotta...

170
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:22,079
understand that unfortunately
most people lack self-awareness.

171
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:23,879
You should really keep that
in mind as you had

172
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:25,850
another transient of
second period.

173
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,930
You'll meet them again
at every age.

174
00:11:32,351 --> 00:11:35,301
- I want to see the Principle!
- That's her, mom.

175
00:11:35,371 --> 00:11:38,382
You're the bitch that expelled
my baby? And for what?

176
00:11:38,202 --> 00:11:40,982
- Excuse me, maybe you'd like...
- Because you can't handle it?

177
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,512
Bitch why are you here?

178
00:11:42,522 --> 00:11:47,513
You wanna be at home everyday.
I don't have time for this bullshit!

179
00:11:45,323 --> 00:11:47,643
- Keep your voice down!
- Why are you here?

180
00:11:47,843 --> 00:11:50,084
Hey mam, clam down.
We'll go talk about this

181
00:11:50,094 --> 00:11:52,934
in the Dean's Office.
- I ain't goin' nowhere with you.

182
00:11:52,634 --> 00:11:54,585
Look, miss, I know
you're angry

183
00:11:54,595 --> 00:11:57,185
but they won't listen to you,
you need to talk to me.

184
00:11:57,475 --> 00:12:00,276
- Racist bitch, I'ma sue
your ass. - Come on, ladies.

185
00:12:00,378 --> 00:12:01,429
This way

186
00:12:02,266 --> 00:12:04,086
- Ladies
- What happened?

187
00:12:04,226 --> 00:12:06,337
Bitch, if you gimme
any mo' shit in the class

188
00:12:06,347 --> 00:12:10,587
and I'ma getta my niggas
fuckin' gang rape your ass!

189
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,930
- Excuse me. Are you
new here? - It's, first day.

190
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,341
Welcome. That was quite
a scene back there.

191
00:12:32,341 --> 00:12:36,572
I was a little stunned.
But it's actually safe here.

192
00:12:36,852 --> 00:12:40,142
- Sorry, I'm Miss Madison.
- I am Henry, Henry Barth.

193
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:05,677
Whatever is on my mind,
I say there's a feeling.

194
00:13:05,817 --> 00:13:07,317
I'm truthful to myself.

195
00:13:07,817 --> 00:13:10,788
I am young,
and I'm old.

196
00:13:10,798 --> 00:13:13,358
I've been bought
and I've been sold,

197
00:13:13,478 --> 00:13:15,798
so many times.

198
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:22,130
I am hard to face.
I am gone.

199
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,480
I am just like you.

200
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,790
Patricia!

201
00:13:31,271 --> 00:13:34,272
Patricia!

202
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,685
- Hello? - Henry, it's Rita,
from the hospital.

203
00:13:53,985 --> 00:13:56,495
He's done it again, you
need to get down here.

204
00:13:56,805 --> 00:13:59,686
Bastards, leave me alone!

205
00:13:59,696 --> 00:14:00,906
Why aren't you
handling this?

206
00:14:00,903 --> 00:14:02,187
I can't get him out!

207
00:14:02,186 --> 00:14:05,757
- You come and get him.
- Patricia.

208
00:14:09,258 --> 00:14:11,098
Thanks.

209
00:14:12,488 --> 00:14:14,959
Grandpa, come on.
It's Henry, open the door.

210
00:14:15,609 --> 00:14:16,589
Patricia!

211
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:18,589
No, it's Henry. It's Henry.

212
00:14:18,909 --> 00:14:20,690
- Who?
- It's Henry.

213
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:25,210
Grandpa, please, open...
Open the door.

214
00:14:27,961 --> 00:14:30,211
Hi, sweetheart.

215
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:33,282
I thought you were
your mom.

216
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,912
You're dressed okay, there...

217
00:14:35,912 --> 00:14:37,712
Were you going somewhere?

218
00:14:37,742 --> 00:14:39,713
Now I'm goin' to work.

219
00:14:39,673 --> 00:14:42,983
You are tired, OK?

220
00:14:43,203 --> 00:14:47,374
It's very, very late so I need
you to go to sleep, OK?

221
00:14:47,724 --> 00:14:50,015
Lets come to bed.

222
00:14:53,505 --> 00:14:55,025
How're you doin', huh?

223
00:15:00,046 --> 00:15:03,717
Some old people sleep
a lot before they die.

224
00:15:05,057 --> 00:15:08,568
Isn't that silly?

225
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:27,679
Fuck.

226
00:15:30,922 --> 00:15:33,022
- Everything okay?
- You shut up!

227
00:15:33,196 --> 00:15:34,091
You listen

228
00:15:34,742 --> 00:15:37,123
I know you're just some
under-educated drone

229
00:15:37,073 --> 00:15:39,923
passing the time with
these old dying people

230
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:43,624
But I'm paying for his assisted
living, and you're not assisting him.

231
00:15:43,664 --> 00:15:47,324
I told you, take the lock
off of his bathroom door!

232
00:15:47,824 --> 00:15:49,745
You know how he gets
at night and forgets?

233
00:15:49,745 --> 00:15:53,325
So you need to be there for
him, to make him feel safe.

234
00:15:53,525 --> 00:15:54,926
Let me be very clear here!

235
00:15:54,976 --> 00:16:00,527
You stop neglecting his needs
or I'll start fucking with yours!

236
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:02,427
I will have you fired!

237
00:16:02,497 --> 00:16:05,177
Then it's gonna
 be your family!

238
00:16:05,207 --> 00:16:06,728
Your children,

239
00:16:06,728 --> 00:16:09,128
are gonna be at risk!

240
00:16:09,376 --> 00:16:10,680
You got it?!

241
00:16:10,977 --> 00:16:12,073
I got it.

242
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:16,629
Don't you ever make me come
down here again at this hour, OK?

243
00:17:07,048 --> 00:17:08,788
Gimme the fuckin' money!

244
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:11,039
You heard me!
Gimmme the fuckin' money!

245
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,759
Give me the fucking
money now!

246
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:15,939
You think I like you?
Give me the fucking money!

247
00:17:15,989 --> 00:17:17,990
- You want money?
- Now!

248
00:18:01,157 --> 00:18:03,548
Why are you following me?

249
00:18:02,647 --> 00:18:05,908
I am not. It's late, you should
be home, not to screw men.

250
00:18:05,912 --> 00:18:08,139
What? Are you crazy now?

251
00:18:08,518 --> 00:18:10,209
- What the fuck is your deal, huh?
- Get away from me.

252
00:18:10,209 --> 00:18:13,149
Why did you let that guy
beat the shit out of me?

253
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:16,450
- Huh? You just sat there, like you
were a fuckin lemon or something.

254
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,550
Excuse me, I don't wanna
talk to you.

255
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,520
You think there's something
wrong with that?

256
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,450
Listen, little kid.

257
00:18:20,471 --> 00:18:22,621
I don't know how old you
were when it all went wrong,

258
00:18:22,621 --> 00:18:24,291
but this isn't
the fucking answer, OK?

259
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,401
You'll figure it out,

260
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:28,152
'cause you're gonne get
really old really quick.

261
00:18:27,162 --> 00:18:28,652
Know that! - Why are you
so mean to me, huh?

262
00:18:28,662 --> 00:18:30,172
You don't think I have feelings?

263
00:18:30,452 --> 00:18:32,753
Do you?
Do you have feelings?

264
00:18:32,803 --> 00:18:33,773
Listen, pal!

265
00:18:33,773 --> 00:18:35,363
I mean, between you and me

266
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:38,254
you look like you've got
more problems than me.

267
00:18:38,374 --> 00:18:40,154
- Oh really?
- Yeah, really!

268
00:18:40,304 --> 00:18:42,654
- So come on, I'll make you better.
- What are you doing? Get off, please.

269
00:18:42,674 --> 00:18:43,754
- Are you flerting with me?
- Nothing,

270
00:18:43,764 --> 00:18:45,575
I'm just offering to hang out,
if you know what I mean.

271
00:18:45,585 --> 00:18:47,505
- I don't wanna hang out with you.
- I don't know. You seem kinda lonely.

272
00:18:47,505 --> 00:18:50,646
Maybe we go back
to your place just relax.

273
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:54,156
Afraid you'll like it?

274
00:18:54,306 --> 00:18:56,457
I'm afraid you've been
fucked and thrown away

275
00:18:56,507 --> 00:18:58,347
so many times
you've gotten used to it.

276
00:18:58,357 --> 00:18:59,917
Fuck you, man!

277
00:19:01,688 --> 00:19:02,908
Fuck off, queer.

278
00:19:03,468 --> 00:19:05,698
Have a good night, yeah.

279
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:07,649
Yeah, yeah!
Just walk away? Hey?

280
00:19:08,149 --> 00:19:10,689
Where are you going?

281
00:19:26,342 --> 00:19:29,142
"He just fucks
their shit up, and..."

282
00:19:29,432 --> 00:19:31,753
"The ladies cry for me ..."

283
00:19:32,062 --> 00:19:33,681
"At the funeral"

284
00:19:33,783 --> 00:19:36,263
"'cause I aint around no more,"

285
00:19:36,544 --> 00:19:38,804
"to dicks that split up ..."

286
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,086
"Raw and shit ..."

287
00:19:41,654 --> 00:19:44,145
"And ma boys all gets faded ..."

288
00:19:44,145 --> 00:19:48,175
"pleasin' that skunk shit and fuck."

289
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:50,266
Toni V.

290
00:19:54,247 --> 00:19:56,387
You know it's funny
I spend a lot of time

291
00:19:56,967 --> 00:20:01,468
trying to not have to deal,
to not really commit.

292
00:20:01,888 --> 00:20:03,548
I am a substitute teacher.

293
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:06,189
There's no real
responsibility to teach.

294
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:09,069
The responsibility is
to maintain order,

295
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:12,070
make sure nobody kills
anybody in your classroom,

296
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,530
and then they get
to the next period.

297
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,530
"She used to be a sweet girl"

298
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,621
"She never seemed
disatisfied with her life."

299
00:20:18,621 --> 00:20:20,181
"And why should she have been?"

300
00:20:20,441 --> 00:20:22,981
"Her mother and I gave her
everything she needed ... "

301
00:20:23,732 --> 00:20:25,672
"So why did she
become so angry?"

302
00:20:26,022 --> 00:20:28,902
"So miserable and mean
all of a sudden"

303
00:20:28,906 --> 00:20:30,125
"We don't know."

304
00:20:30,123 --> 00:20:32,383
"Frankly, it doesn't reflect on us."

305
00:20:32,973 --> 00:20:34,663
"We were good parents"

306
00:20:35,524 --> 00:20:38,224
"But still, she repaid us
for all we've done"

307
00:20:38,454 --> 00:20:40,274
"by killing herself"

308
00:20:41,255 --> 00:20:43,275
"Stupid selfish Child"

309
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:47,526
"Now she'll never
get into Princeton"

310
00:20:47,764 --> 00:20:49,606
No name.

311
00:20:54,477 --> 00:20:56,357
"Hi Lupe, Dean Vargas again"

312
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,739
"I can't do it anymore"

313
00:20:59,144 --> 00:21:01,769
" I ...um I quit! "

314
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:11,450
Oh, if it isn't
the lovely Dr. Parker.

315
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,680
Would you like a happy
help you through the day?

316
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,670
They're yummy.

317
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:20,731
I need you to fill in for Dean
Vargas in the second period.

318
00:21:20,151 --> 00:21:22,382
I'm worried about you, Charlie.

319
00:21:26,682 --> 00:21:30,683
I just, er... maybe love
watchin' you leave the room.

320
00:21:32,933 --> 00:21:36,744
Mr. Seaboldt. He maintained
a sense of humor.

321
00:21:38,754 --> 00:21:43,145
I think the sense of humor
is key. I don't posses it.

322
00:21:43,411 --> 00:21:44,929
I mean, I do ...

323
00:21:45,426 --> 00:21:47,836
in a tragic sort of way.

324
00:21:47,836 --> 00:21:49,686
Whatcha doin' here, Mr. Sea?

325
00:21:49,566 --> 00:21:51,737
Uhm, filling in for
Dean Vargas.

326
00:21:51,807 --> 00:21:53,637
Vargas is a bitch.

327
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:56,687
Talk shit, you get
slaped like a bitch.

328
00:21:56,787 --> 00:21:58,738
You're not gonna get me
no detention neither.

329
00:21:58,748 --> 00:22:01,738
I'm gonna un-fuck your shit
uptight, you motherfucker!

330
00:22:01,928 --> 00:22:06,189
Un-shit... No, un-fuck
your shit uptight, motherfucker.

331
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:09,890
Wow! That is,
I mean, really poetic.

332
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,290
I mean, that's truly...
What, lyrical.

333
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,950
You should take that
on the stage.

334
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,511
I mean that shit sells itself.

335
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:21,139
Umm, hey who could talk
some of my thought says

336
00:22:21,582 --> 00:22:25,262
I am going to un-fuck your
shit uptight, motherfucker.

337
00:22:26,172 --> 00:22:27,933
I'll tell you what I will do, laddy.

338
00:22:27,933 --> 00:22:29,653
I'll un-fuck your shit uptight.

339
00:22:30,103 --> 00:22:34,194
And un-fuck it right uptight
up your ass, you motherfucker.

340
00:22:34,334 --> 00:22:42,845
I'm going to un-fuck your shit
uptight, you motherfucker!

341
00:22:42,915 --> 00:22:44,461
I'll tell what, um...

342
00:22:44,466 --> 00:22:47,196
Why don't you have a seat,
OK? And then I'll...

343
00:22:47,336 --> 00:22:49,897
I'll back shortly and we'll
discuss your bright future.

344
00:22:49,898 --> 00:22:51,474
Okay, my man?

345
00:22:51,477 --> 00:22:53,367
I mean, my motherfucker.

346
00:22:55,397 --> 00:22:56,708
Okay, Mae West?

347
00:23:01,744 --> 00:23:04,035
Ellen, can I see your nipples?

348
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,912
What? No!

349
00:23:06,749 --> 00:23:07,820
Wrong.

350
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,480
See I... Actually I can.

351
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:12,370
See, that's the whole point,
you have to wear bra to school.

352
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,351
Look Mr. Seaboldt,
I'm just being me.

353
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:17,351
I don't tell you how to dress,
so you don't tell me.

354
00:23:17,441 --> 00:23:18,511
Capiche?

355
00:23:25,423 --> 00:23:27,203
Ellen, do you know
what that is?

356
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:31,324
It's a beautiful picture
of a sunset in Hawaii.

357
00:23:31,684 --> 00:23:33,414
It's rather pretty, isn't it?

358
00:23:33,854 --> 00:23:35,114
Now, Ellen.

359
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:37,935
Do you know what that is?

360
00:23:37,935 --> 00:23:40,405
That's a vagina
infected with gonorrhea.

361
00:23:40,465 --> 00:23:41,915
That's fucking grose.

362
00:23:41,915 --> 00:23:44,146
Yes very. So, you see,

363
00:23:44,146 --> 00:23:46,906
when you come to school
dressed like that, you give

364
00:23:46,906 --> 00:23:48,707
you give out the wrong signal.

365
00:23:48,707 --> 00:23:50,407
Don't you want people
treat you with respect?

366
00:23:50,447 --> 00:23:51,607
Yo! I get respect.

367
00:23:51,617 --> 00:23:53,507
I don't give it up to
every dick in my face.

368
00:23:53,597 --> 00:23:56,838
Every "dick" in your face.

369
00:23:57,968 --> 00:24:00,189
That's respectful.

370
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:05,609
Put this on.
Wear that for the rest...

371
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:08,660
Hey I said wear that
for the rest of the day.

372
00:24:09,035 --> 00:24:10,302
Okay?

373
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:11,820
Can I go now?

374
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:14,671
I supposed you can, I mean.

375
00:24:15,931 --> 00:24:17,692
If we're done.
Are we done?

376
00:24:18,532 --> 00:24:20,872
- We're done.
- We're done.

377
00:24:20,912 --> 00:24:23,283
Another student saved.

378
00:24:26,403 --> 00:24:27,733
Come out of
the bathroom, grandma!

379
00:24:29,113 --> 00:24:30,484
Come on granma,
open the door.

380
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,525
Hi, grandpa.

381
00:24:37,455 --> 00:24:38,255
Grandpa.

382
00:24:40,405 --> 00:24:41,216
Grandpa.

383
00:24:42,468 --> 00:24:43,458
You okay?

384
00:24:43,656 --> 00:24:45,296
What is it, grandpa?

385
00:24:45,596 --> 00:24:47,227
It's Henry, grandpa.

386
00:24:48,077 --> 00:24:49,567
Grandpa, it's Henry.

387
00:24:49,627 --> 00:24:52,127
- Who?
- Are you in pain?

388
00:24:52,127 --> 00:24:55,428
No, no. I ...
I pissed myself.

389
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:02,739
Come on, grandma,
open the door!

390
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:03,959
Excuse me

391
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,221
Excuse me

392
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:08,430
- Can you come in here please?
- We have a little accident?

393
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,611
- Yes
-  You should ... haa..

394
00:25:14,301 --> 00:25:18,722
- Do you wanna? - No, no.
- See, we're taking care of it.

395
00:25:18,732 --> 00:25:20,012
See? You're okay.

396
00:25:20,012 --> 00:25:24,233
- You right? - Are you doin'
any writing, grandpa?

397
00:25:24,433 --> 00:25:26,123
In journals?

398
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:27,761
No, my life ...

399
00:25:28,664 --> 00:25:32,304
My life isn't worth memoires.

400
00:25:33,154 --> 00:25:34,955
It's ok, it's okay.

401
00:25:36,115 --> 00:25:39,065
I didn't wanna to go
out like this.

402
00:25:39,796 --> 00:25:42,236
I hate being a burden.

403
00:25:42,606 --> 00:25:43,986
You're not a burden.

404
00:25:43,986 --> 00:25:45,314
Okay?

405
00:25:45,707 --> 00:25:47,407
You're not a burden.

406
00:25:47,407 --> 00:25:52,718
Sure. You...
You like coming here, eh?

407
00:25:54,018 --> 00:25:57,319
Your mother came by today.

408
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:00,039
Have you spoken to her lately?

409
00:26:01,419 --> 00:26:02,629
No.

410
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,320
Now, you tell her
I'm fine?

411
00:26:10,021 --> 00:26:14,732
You always say you're fine, but
I know you hide things from me.

412
00:26:14,922 --> 00:26:17,122
You've always been closed off.

413
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:19,952
Ever since you were a kid.

414
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:21,799
Why is that?

415
00:26:24,867 --> 00:26:26,397
Why?

416
00:26:28,274 --> 00:26:32,235
Ah, you're upset. I shouldn't
say these things to you...

417
00:26:32,285 --> 00:26:35,735
- I don't mean to make you...
- You haven't upset me, grandpa.

418
00:26:35,755 --> 00:26:38,826
It's that I don't wanna
talk about the past.

419
00:26:39,076 --> 00:26:42,786
You and I remember it
very differently.

420
00:26:44,217 --> 00:26:47,217
Get rest, O.K?
Close your eyes. I'm here.

421
00:26:47,837 --> 00:26:52,738
- I am in here with you
- When you stop coming, Henry

422
00:26:52,758 --> 00:26:54,658
I'll die.

423
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:00,159
Fuck.

424
00:27:39,606 --> 00:27:40,646
You got a smoke?

425
00:27:41,836 --> 00:27:44,117
No, I don't have a smoke.

426
00:27:44,547 --> 00:27:46,737
Where did you go, eh?

427
00:27:48,538 --> 00:27:51,078
- What are you gonna do now?
- What are you gonna do, little kid?

428
00:27:51,318 --> 00:27:52,568
I don't know.

429
00:27:53,828 --> 00:27:57,129
Can you lend me ten bucks?

430
00:27:57,289 --> 00:28:00,550
Come on, man I'm hungry.

431
00:28:11,592 --> 00:28:15,622
I may have something
to eat at my place.

432
00:28:26,649 --> 00:28:29,280
Come in, wash your hands.

433
00:28:31,935 --> 00:28:34,815
There's soap over there.

434
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:50,808
Sit down.

435
00:28:53,639 --> 00:28:56,909
Really nice place you got.

436
00:29:06,501 --> 00:29:08,361
Thanks.

437
00:29:12,312 --> 00:29:15,832
- You got anything stronger?
- Eat your sandwich.

438
00:29:37,106 --> 00:29:39,347
Hey, hold on man!

439
00:29:39,367 --> 00:29:42,347
- It's a 100 bucks.
- Relax...

440
00:30:11,292 --> 00:30:13,202
What?

441
00:30:14,603 --> 00:30:18,763
- Have you been raped recently?
- What do you care?

442
00:30:19,023 --> 00:30:23,024
I'm not sure
that I do particulary.

443
00:30:23,124 --> 00:30:27,155
Find and put something on it.

444
00:30:37,776 --> 00:30:40,647
Look, I gotta get back.

445
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:41,929
Back?

446
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,367
Back where?

447
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:45,398
Listen, buddy,

448
00:30:45,398 --> 00:30:48,078
If you don't got the
money it's cool. I mean,

449
00:30:48,128 --> 00:30:49,388
I like you.

450
00:30:49,689 --> 00:30:51,129
I'll blow you for 50?

451
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:52,179
Listen to me,

452
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:55,039
knock off the bullsit, okay?

453
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,610
Come in the bathroom.

454
00:31:14,983 --> 00:31:18,203
It's gonna sting a little bit.

455
00:31:20,184 --> 00:31:21,894
Why are you doing this?

456
00:31:22,175 --> 00:31:25,591
Take a shower

457
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:28,755
- This is fresh towel.
- Thanks.

458
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,641
Go to sleep.

459
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:58,752
Hello, this is Dr. Parker

460
00:32:58,751 --> 00:33:02,151
My son's ADHD and I looked it up
online, and that's what hes' got.

461
00:33:02,161 --> 00:33:03,631
Now you gotta
get im a free laptop.

462
00:33:03,931 --> 00:33:05,232
Mr. Kevin, your son Oliver
injured a student.

463
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,152
His problems are behavioral.

464
00:33:09,162 --> 00:33:12,153
Hey, my kid's got a disability
and he's not learning anything,

465
00:33:12,153 --> 00:33:13,333
and this is your fault!

466
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:15,103
Hey, hey...
What are you doing?

467
00:33:15,203 --> 00:33:17,504
What is the matter with you?

468
00:33:17,504 --> 00:33:19,804
As it is, our resources emaciated.

469
00:33:19,824 --> 00:33:22,825
Now, I heave real LD kids
that need my attention.

470
00:33:23,105 --> 00:33:26,905
He's always mad all the time because
he's not getting the services he needs.

471
00:33:26,935 --> 00:33:30,486
No Child Left Behind
promises me my rights.

472
00:33:29,256 --> 00:33:34,257
You'll be hearing from
my lawyer. - Mr...

473
00:34:12,943 --> 00:34:17,354
Hey, what are you doing?
What is this?

474
00:34:21,335 --> 00:34:25,365
What is this? Funny? Get to
class. Get to class right now.

475
00:34:26,776 --> 00:34:29,116
What's the joke?
I don't get the joke. Huh?

476
00:34:29,226 --> 00:34:31,616
Is this funny? Does that
look good to you?

477
00:34:31,656 --> 00:34:35,517
You like hurting animals? Huh?!
Is that what you like to do?

478
00:34:35,567 --> 00:34:38,658
Answer me! You like hurting
animals? You like this?!

479
00:34:38,658 --> 00:34:42,228
Come here. Go.
Lets go. Come on.

480
00:34:42,338 --> 00:34:44,409
Walk

481
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,120
Mr. Raymond, the studies
have shown that kids

482
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:55,671
who are prone to hurting
animals at an early age

483
00:34:55,681 --> 00:34:58,811
eventually fall into a
high percentage of adults

484
00:34:58,821 --> 00:35:03,322
who may fail to develop even
the most basic feeling for people.

485
00:35:03,772 --> 00:35:05,072
Raven.

486
00:35:07,701 --> 00:35:09,766
How do you feel about this?

487
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:11,536
I feel ...

488
00:35:12,289 --> 00:35:13,812
Trapped.

489
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,174
Like the cat.

490
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,472
Fuck.

491
00:35:55,674 --> 00:35:57,177
Who are you? Why?

492
00:35:57,931 --> 00:35:59,782
Did you pay?
Did you pay her?

493
00:35:59,822 --> 00:36:02,872
- Yeah alright, here...
-  Pay her!

494
00:36:03,212 --> 00:36:07,023
- Alright, here, take...
- What are you paying me for, huh?!

495
00:36:07,273 --> 00:36:08,483
It wasn't in my mouth!

496
00:36:09,573 --> 00:36:12,424
Get fuck out of here.
Get out of here! Fuck!

497
00:36:14,664 --> 00:36:16,764
Don't hurt me!

498
00:36:24,371 --> 00:36:25,171
Here ...

499
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:30,117
Change your sheets!

500
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:43,259
How do you do it kid?

501
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,450
Please don't be mad at me.

502
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:51,790
I am not mad at you.

503
00:36:52,471 --> 00:36:54,691
Don't think about
leaving me.

504
00:36:55,621 --> 00:36:58,372
I won't do it anymore,
I promise.

505
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,452
You don't need to promise me.

506
00:37:02,842 --> 00:37:04,703
Okay don't promise to me.

507
00:37:05,012 --> 00:37:09,375
Whatever it is, you feel
you need to do, you do it.

508
00:37:09,653 --> 00:37:11,224
But you don't do it here!

509
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:12,834
Okay?

510
00:37:14,201 --> 00:37:15,894
What are you doing there?

511
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:17,845
Don't you knock?

512
00:37:19,915 --> 00:37:23,456
What is all this supposed to be?
Your tortured soul?

513
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:27,196
Why don't you paint
something cheerful?

514
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:29,458
Like happy with colors.

515
00:37:29,457 --> 00:37:32,307
Whadya want from me dad, besides
for me to have been born with a penis.

516
00:37:32,303 --> 00:37:33,481
I don't work all day

517
00:37:33,478 --> 00:37:36,648
to have my night ruined
by your teen angst.

518
00:37:36,878 --> 00:37:40,549
???

519
00:37:40,569 --> 00:37:44,929
I am not goin' to support you
and your little creative habits!

520
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,980
Okay? I've had it with all
of all your little art projects

521
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,880
that are going nowhere!

522
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,411
You always know
what to say, dad.

523
00:37:52,481 --> 00:37:57,482
Now, if you cleared...

524
00:37:55,411 --> 00:37:57,702
and lost some weight

525
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,373
you could attract
a nice boys, who knows.

526
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:06,971
There should be

527
00:38:08,394 --> 00:38:09,994
a prerequisite,

528
00:38:11,574 --> 00:38:16,135
curriculum for being an parent,
before the people attempt to.

529
00:38:20,226 --> 00:38:21,736
Don't try this at home.

530
00:38:25,696 --> 00:38:27,257
Take these.

531
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:34,038
What are those?

532
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:36,478
You're supposed to ask me
before you take them.

533
00:38:37,278 --> 00:38:38,939
They're vitamins,

534
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:40,199
and Aspirin.

535
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,932
At some point

536
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,450
you should get an HIV test.

537
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:50,141
At some point.

538
00:39:03,973 --> 00:39:06,543
Why are you crying on the bus?

539
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:18,395
Go to sleep.

540
00:39:37,846 --> 00:39:38,935
A friend of yours?

541
00:39:39,249 --> 00:39:40,629
A friend.

542
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:42,690
Oh...No, no...

543
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,400
He was ....

544
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,240
Total asshole.

545
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:50,391
What was his problem?

546
00:39:51,171 --> 00:39:54,182
He chose a vocation that
did not choose him.

547
00:39:54,512 --> 00:39:56,132
And then he spent his
whole career

548
00:39:56,232 --> 00:39:59,402
"casting pearls before swine",
He talked like that...

549
00:40:01,013 --> 00:40:02,613
The child-hater, basically.

550
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:07,924
He tried to purge Steinbeck and
Faulkner from required reading list.

551
00:40:08,004 --> 00:40:11,645
Well, let it be said from
the safety of his sabbatical,

552
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:15,285
You can do no more harm.

553
00:40:15,895 --> 00:40:16,985
How did he die?

554
00:40:17,524 --> 00:40:19,856
Who knows, and who cares.

555
00:40:31,209 --> 00:40:32,289
"Hello"

556
00:40:32,288 --> 00:40:34,308
"It's drudgery, this life"

557
00:40:34,798 --> 00:40:36,406
"and retention"

558
00:40:36,509 --> 00:40:38,679
"suspension, expulsion"

559
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:40,239
"staff meetings"

560
00:40:40,668 --> 00:40:42,169
"The Papers cuts"

561
00:40:42,169 --> 00:40:43,497
"The vacant parents"

562
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,010
"Their vicious kids"

563
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,981
"Theye're the dreads
of the pain"

564
00:40:46,981 --> 00:40:48,891
"They spat on my soul"

565
00:40:49,331 --> 00:40:51,521
"This humiliation will stop"

566
00:40:51,521 --> 00:40:55,672
"Discipline must be restored,
these kids have us on the run."

567
00:40:55,672 --> 00:40:57,802
" We're the ones on trial!"

568
00:40:57,802 --> 00:41:00,213
" It's fucking madness! "

569
00:41:00,543 --> 00:41:02,433
"Like every child has value? "

570
00:41:02,433 --> 00:41:05,274
"Is aware and worthy of
a private education"

571
00:41:05,274 --> 00:41:08,404
"Fucking kids who have
no desires,"

572
00:41:08,614 --> 00:41:09,714
"no fire..."

573
00:41:09,714 --> 00:41:11,285
"No minds to be..."

574
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,269
" Assimilate "

575
00:41:38,369 --> 00:41:39,730
What does that mean?

576
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:43,280
To take something in.

577
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,961
OK, excellent. To absorb.

578
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:48,217
" Ubiquitous "

579
00:41:49,078 --> 00:41:50,755
Anyone?

580
00:41:53,492 --> 00:41:55,182
Everywhere, all the time.

581
00:41:55,592 --> 00:41:57,843
So what...

582
00:41:58,023 --> 00:42:01,873
"ubiquitous assimilation"

583
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:06,854
Always absorbing everything
everywhere all the time.

584
00:42:07,271 --> 00:42:08,803
Well done, George.

585
00:42:09,285 --> 00:42:11,675
How are you
to imagine anything,

586
00:42:12,065 --> 00:42:14,556
if the images are always
provided for you?

587
00:42:15,656 --> 00:42:18,736
Who here had read
"1984" last year?

588
00:42:19,156 --> 00:42:20,207
Good.

589
00:42:25,435 --> 00:42:26,717
Anyone?

590
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:28,608
Meredith.

591
00:42:28,758 --> 00:42:32,109
Having two opposing
beliefs at once.

592
00:42:32,109 --> 00:42:33,789
Believing that both are true.

593
00:42:33,989 --> 00:42:35,259
Excellent.

594
00:42:35,669 --> 00:42:38,280
Why do you always suck
his dick, you fuckin' kiss-ass?

595
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,990
To deliberately believe in lies

596
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,951
while knowning they're false.

597
00:42:47,411 --> 00:42:49,532
Examples of this
in everyday life:

598
00:42:49,972 --> 00:42:51,282
Oh, I,

599
00:42:52,472 --> 00:42:55,133
need to be pretty
to be happy.

600
00:42:56,613 --> 00:42:59,163
I need surgery
to be pretty.

601
00:43:00,061 --> 00:43:02,274
I need to be thin

602
00:43:02,274 --> 00:43:03,650
Famous

603
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,116
Fashionable

604
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:08,045
Our young men,

605
00:43:09,265 --> 00:43:10,865
today,

606
00:43:11,385 --> 00:43:13,466
are being told that women

607
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:14,946
are whores;

608
00:43:14,946 --> 00:43:17,266
bitches, things to be screwed,

609
00:43:19,307 --> 00:43:20,707
beaten,

610
00:43:21,477 --> 00:43:22,997
shit on,

611
00:43:23,747 --> 00:43:25,338
ashamed.

612
00:43:26,348 --> 00:43:29,238
This is a marketing holocaust.

613
00:43:29,858 --> 00:43:31,149
24 hours a day,

614
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,109
for the rest of our lives,

615
00:43:33,849 --> 00:43:35,529
the powers that be

616
00:43:35,629 --> 00:43:36,610
are hard at work

617
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,350
dumbing us

618
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,720
to death.

619
00:43:41,561 --> 00:43:44,196
So, to defend ourselves

620
00:43:44,921 --> 00:43:50,432
and fight against assimilating this
dullness into our thought processes,

621
00:43:50,792 --> 00:43:52,462
we must learn to read

622
00:43:52,762 --> 00:43:55,003
to stimulate our own imagination;

623
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,463
to cultivate

624
00:43:56,783 --> 00:43:59,463
our own consciousness,

625
00:43:59,664 --> 00:44:02,294
our own belief system.

626
00:44:03,055 --> 00:44:04,744
We all need these skills

627
00:44:04,744 --> 00:44:06,585
to defend

628
00:44:07,465 --> 00:44:09,065
to preserve

629
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:14,266
our own minds.

630
00:44:26,468 --> 00:44:29,009
Very carefully, it's perfect.

631
00:44:29,949 --> 00:44:31,079
Great.

632
00:44:31,989 --> 00:44:33,269
Let me have a look.

633
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,130
You just made your own...

634
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:41,421
- Wow. I don't care what
they say, you're doing great.

635
00:44:42,421 --> 00:44:44,461
I had hard time with
math too. It takes time.

636
00:44:45,351 --> 00:44:47,392
Wow, that is damn cool.

637
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:50,932
Hi guys.

638
00:44:51,242 --> 00:44:52,863
Thank you for staying late,

639
00:44:53,413 --> 00:44:55,483
all 15 or 20 of you.

640
00:44:56,783 --> 00:45:03,514
Today we'll be presented
with a new course work

641
00:44:59,604 --> 00:45:04,605
engineered to boost
State exam performance,

642
00:45:03,624 --> 00:45:06,685
as mandated by
"No child had left behind".

643
00:45:12,746 --> 00:45:16,567
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,
it is my pleasure to be here.

644
00:45:16,517 --> 00:45:24,058
I've come today with some
edifying materials

645
00:45:19,997 --> 00:45:24,998
to help your matriculating and
non matric students

646
00:45:24,258 --> 00:45:27,499
to better prepare for the
upcoming State Exams this May.

647
00:45:27,783 --> 00:45:29,184
Let me start by stating

648
00:45:29,189 --> 00:45:31,849
I love teachers.

649
00:45:32,449 --> 00:45:34,080
I love what you do,

650
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,920
what you stand for.

651
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,981
You guys are the real heroes.

652
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:42,971
Now, the  one thing I've learned
in all my years in the private sector,

653
00:45:43,781 --> 00:45:44,872
is that

654
00:45:45,072 --> 00:45:48,282
real estate generates revenue

655
00:45:48,382 --> 00:45:51,313
And merchanting property values
will be this school's saving grades.

656
00:45:52,023 --> 00:45:54,993
But your school's
low test scores

657
00:45:55,813 --> 00:45:59,034
are bringing down the whole re-sale
value in this neighborhood

658
00:45:59,034 --> 00:46:01,544
during the market already in decline.

659
00:46:02,334 --> 00:46:04,175
We gotta get the scores up -

660
00:46:04,195 --> 00:46:06,215
new families in our district

661
00:46:07,935 --> 00:46:09,956
and more motivated
kids in the school.

662
00:46:10,736 --> 00:46:12,396
And I am not placing any blame

663
00:46:12,396 --> 00:46:15,297
Excuse me, are you here
to sell some tests material

664
00:46:15,297 --> 00:46:18,637
or to air your concerns
as a property owner?

665
00:46:18,647 --> 00:46:21,688
Listen, umm ... I am curious

666
00:46:21,698 --> 00:46:24,698
Are you givin' away pop-corn with
this crap that you're pushing?

667
00:46:24,798 --> 00:46:28,159
This faculty has spent their lives
on the boards, and now you tell us

668
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:31,650
that our careers are
about re-sale value.

669
00:46:31,654 --> 00:46:33,117
- Bullshit !
- Give him hell lady ...

670
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:35,030
- Storm the game.
- Don't oversimplify it, mam.

671
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,600
That's a hazard you
can't afford.

672
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,891
This sounds like a threat.

673
00:46:37,891 --> 00:46:39,441
- Could you please sit down?

674
00:46:39,441 --> 00:46:40,761
That's enough.
Could you please sit down?

675
00:46:40,761 --> 00:46:43,432
Can we have some
order here, please.

676
00:46:45,322 --> 00:46:46,992
Dr. Heart was right.

677
00:46:47,452 --> 00:46:49,983
- This school's the pride of
the district. - Can you get back, pal?

678
00:46:49,983 --> 00:46:51,803
Could you finish your pitch,
we'd like to go home?

679
00:46:51,923 --> 00:46:53,433
What's you hurry, hon?

680
00:46:53,743 --> 00:46:56,224
You gotta...

681
00:46:56,504 --> 00:46:59,474
So enjoy running this relic
for a few more months.

682
00:46:59,474 --> 00:47:03,035
You're a fossil when
you're fucking done.

683
00:47:13,447 --> 00:47:15,847
You're dread going home?

684
00:47:17,047 --> 00:47:21,198
Frankly, I don't know what to do
with myself when I'm not in my classroom.

685
00:47:21,168 --> 00:47:24,819
So, Friday afternoons
 I am afraid to go home.

686
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,639
Afraid of all that time alone.

687
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:30,940
Yeah.

688
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:39,231
- My mother hates
my father passionately...

689
00:47:39,571 --> 00:47:41,011
...watches a lot of TV

690
00:47:41,241 --> 00:47:43,862
...the only time that I don't feel

691
00:47:44,142 --> 00:47:46,792
- I teach for selfish reasons...
- My mother was in Mac Madisson

692
00:47:46,882 --> 00:47:48,463
...I need a control

693
00:47:48,463 --> 00:47:51,153
- I need those kids more than...

694
00:47:51,153 --> 00:47:53,393
- Its the moments in school...

695
00:47:53,393 --> 00:47:55,924
It must be like

696
00:47:55,924 --> 00:47:57,164
...best teacher I ever had...

697
00:48:02,465 --> 00:48:05,115
So what's your story?

698
00:48:05,618 --> 00:48:07,437
My story?

699
00:48:11,117 --> 00:48:17,448
I'm just ... I'm just taking
one thing at a time.

700
00:48:18,048 --> 00:48:21,218
Why are you wasting your life?
You know...

701
00:48:21,218 --> 00:48:23,589
I teach every day, I mean...

702
00:48:25,589 --> 00:48:27,599
You don't really know me.

703
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:30,110
So what happened to you?

704
00:48:38,691 --> 00:48:41,302
You don't want something
more permanent?

705
00:48:59,174 --> 00:49:00,577
- Hi
- Where have you been?

706
00:49:01,165 --> 00:49:02,505
What? I was out.

707
00:49:03,545 --> 00:49:07,606
- With a colleague.
- The boy or girl?

708
00:49:08,516 --> 00:49:10,587
A woman.

709
00:49:11,107 --> 00:49:15,468
You make me feel so stupid.
Why are you treating me like a kid?

710
00:49:17,178 --> 00:49:19,028
- Because you're a kid.

711
00:49:19,868 --> 00:49:23,569
I am sorry.
I wasn't expecting this.

712
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:27,079
All you had to do was tell me
you were gonna be home later.

713
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,910
Back up, alright?

714
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:35,641
I'm not beholden to you, okay?

715
00:49:35,631 --> 00:49:38,631
I mean, you're welcome
to stay here, but

716
00:49:38,761 --> 00:49:41,422
you know, you don't get to
have expectations of me, alright?

717
00:49:41,552 --> 00:49:45,563
This is a temporary thing, you ...
you're able to stay here, but ...

718
00:49:45,763 --> 00:49:47,773
eventually you're gonna
have to go, you understand?

719
00:49:48,123 --> 00:49:49,993
- I think it is important...
- It's clear.

720
00:49:50,744 --> 00:49:52,404
I get it, you want
me to go now?

721
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:56,094
I got better to do
than clean up the stuff.

722
00:49:59,495 --> 00:50:01,545
I can't believe you made dinner.

723
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:03,646
With what?

724
00:50:04,146 --> 00:50:08,106
Goceries, from the goceries store.

725
00:50:11,167 --> 00:50:15,488
Wow, it's really nice kid.

726
00:50:16,588 --> 00:50:20,169
It's been long time since
somebody cooked me.

727
00:50:20,899 --> 00:50:22,529
Thank you Erica.

728
00:50:22,609 --> 00:50:27,610
We all have problems, we all
have things that we're dealing with.

729
00:50:25,379 --> 00:50:30,416
And we all ...

730
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:35,481
Take them home with us at night,

731
00:50:36,181 --> 00:50:39,282
take them to work
with us in the morning.

732
00:50:45,313 --> 00:50:53,604
I think that helplesness, that
realization, that foreboding of

733
00:50:54,704 --> 00:51:00,075
being a drift in the sea,
with no

734
00:51:01,116 --> 00:51:06,126
no bowie, no saftey, when you
thought you'd be the one.

735
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:09,487
throwing the bowie.

736
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,480
Hi...

737
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:32,630
- Anything for dinner?
- Tell me all about it from the beginning -

738
00:51:33,021 --> 00:51:36,542
- You don't care.
- Oh no ...

739
00:51:36,642 --> 00:51:38,452
so much, and well.

740
00:51:39,622 --> 00:51:42,183
You are so condescending.

741
00:51:46,193 --> 00:51:47,403
Give me a kiss.

742
00:51:50,164 --> 00:51:54,715
Come on.
We'll solve everything.

743
00:51:55,085 --> 00:51:56,655
- Come on
- Stop it.

744
00:52:04,546 --> 00:52:10,567
Do you remember when
I bought you this?

745
00:52:14,238 --> 00:52:16,498
The beautiful summer in Venice

746
00:52:16,568 --> 00:52:22,569
before our travells were
resigned to reviving old passions.

747
00:52:45,973 --> 00:52:47,794
" You suck! "

748
00:53:47,783 --> 00:53:49,790
- Bloody?
- Yeah

749
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:29,481
- Grandpa, you doing any writing
of your journal? - No...

750
00:54:30,691 --> 00:54:33,282
I don't remember much.

751
00:54:34,882 --> 00:54:40,053
I lost the habbit. You
can't think in this place.

752
00:54:40,053 --> 00:54:42,553
You can't make new memories.

753
00:55:01,807 --> 00:55:03,037
Thank you.

754
00:56:59,267 --> 00:57:01,086
- You alright?
- What?

755
00:57:01,962 --> 00:57:04,764
- You see me?
- You see me standing here?

756
00:57:05,064 --> 00:57:06,940
Yes, I see you.

757
00:57:08,108 --> 00:57:14,109
Oh God, its so relentless.
Thank you.

758
00:57:34,843 --> 00:57:37,203
" Carol, there is no nice way
for me to do this."

759
00:57:37,243 --> 00:57:40,024
"I spoke with the Superintendent"

760
00:57:40,034 --> 00:57:45,035
"He's agreed to let you
out the rest of the year "

761
00:57:42,934 --> 00:57:45,055
" It is where it is."

762
00:57:45,155 --> 00:57:50,295
"Take your pension..."

763
00:57:56,337 --> 00:58:01,557
Haven't you ever had enough.

764
00:58:00,637 --> 00:58:05,688
Havent' you ever just wanted
to tell someone to fuck off.

765
00:58:03,748 --> 00:58:06,028
I think I am sick.

766
00:58:06,978 --> 00:58:08,989
- Why?
-  I crossed the line today.

767
00:58:08,989 --> 00:58:13,219
I mean the whole...
the whole thing is fucked.

768
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,150
Whole thing is fuck,
is it not?

769
00:58:17,184 --> 00:58:19,399
What's up, Dr.Parker?

770
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,041
Can we get over it?
I got shit to do.

771
00:58:24,921 --> 00:58:28,302
What are your plans after High School
since you're not going to college?

772
00:58:28,572 --> 00:58:30,032
I don't know.

773
00:58:30,242 --> 00:58:35,033
Hanging out with my boyfriend.
Do some modelling shit...

774
00:58:36,453 --> 00:58:39,354
- Be in my friend's band.
- I have your 10-week grade report

775
00:58:39,354 --> 00:58:40,284
Do you know what it says?

776
00:58:40,288 --> 00:58:42,243
Fail, Fail, Fail

777
00:58:42,474 --> 00:58:44,375
- F, F, F
- F, F, F yah.

778
00:58:45,145 --> 00:58:47,025
You know what that means?
It mean you don't care.

779
00:58:47,029 --> 00:58:48,597
You're brilliant.

780
00:58:52,397 --> 00:58:54,582
Can I go now?

781
00:58:55,617 --> 00:58:58,217
Oh god, you are a shallow
disgusting creature.

782
00:58:59,877 --> 00:59:05,558
You want to know the truth?
One, you're not gonna be in a band

783
00:59:05,558 --> 00:59:09,029
or an Model Missy,
because you have no ambition.

784
00:59:09,729 --> 00:59:11,339
With no skills, you'll be competing

785
00:59:11,349 --> 00:59:16,350
with the 80% of the U.S. workforce
for a minimum wage job

786
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,880
which you'll work at
for the rest of your life

787
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,850
til you're replaced by a computer.

788
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:19,661
- I don't care
- Two...

789
00:59:19,661 --> 00:59:23,041
The only talent you'll ever have
is getting men to fuck you.

790
00:59:23,241 --> 00:59:25,622
Your life will basically
become a carnivall of pain.

791
00:59:25,622 --> 00:59:27,092
Now, when you can't stand it

792
00:59:27,092 --> 00:59:30,583
not one more day,
not one more hour,

793
00:59:31,813 --> 00:59:34,873
it will get worse,
much worse!

794
00:59:36,444 --> 00:59:41,735
Every day I come into this office and
listen to you kids shit all over yourselves!

795
00:59:43,035 --> 00:59:48,046
It's so easy to be careless. It takes
courage to take care.

796
00:59:48,456 --> 00:59:51,286
Not that you have any
of those qualities.

797
00:59:53,246 --> 00:59:57,367
- Get out! Just get out!
Get out! - Fuck You!!!

798
01:00:02,528 --> 01:00:05,049
- I am a total burn out.
- You are not.

799
01:00:05,409 --> 01:00:09,109
- I am. - I mean I don't know how
you make it through the day.

800
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:14,070
Listen, seriously why do you
think I take these pills for?

801
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:16,050
I mean, that's a

802
01:00:16,711 --> 01:00:21,361
If I didn't take these things I'd be
committing mass murder.

803
01:00:21,841 --> 01:00:24,382
and I'll be helping throwing their
fucking kids out of the window.

804
01:00:24,381 --> 01:00:26,416
Come on, you're the best.

805
01:00:27,536 --> 01:00:30,171
I'll tell you my opinion, the worst
thing about this job

806
01:00:31,113 --> 01:00:33,213
is that nobody says thank you.

807
01:00:34,884 --> 01:00:35,854
- No.
- No.

808
01:00:36,864 --> 01:00:39,264
I'm here to say thank you.

809
01:00:39,684 --> 01:00:41,425
You're doing the job,
that none of us can do.

810
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:43,043
None of us.

811
01:00:44,155 --> 01:00:49,646
- Grace? - Have I ever I told you
that you're the only person

812
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:52,027
I have to talk to.

813
01:01:00,676 --> 01:01:02,735
- Hi Henry
- What happened?

814
01:01:03,128 --> 01:01:04,869
They called to your house.

815
01:01:06,169 --> 01:01:08,899
- Your grandfather felt
some chest pains. - Yeah?

816
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:11,700
The Doctor says he's stable.

817
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:14,250
He doesn't have a lot of time.

818
01:01:17,043 --> 01:01:19,289
- I am so sorry Henry
- How long ...

819
01:01:19,291 --> 01:01:20,461
...have you been here?

820
01:01:20,831 --> 01:01:23,452
Since this morning, I didn't know
how to get a hold of you?

821
01:01:23,872 --> 01:01:26,392
I don't know where you work.

822
01:01:26,922 --> 01:01:29,603
You've been here
all day with him?

823
01:01:38,004 --> 01:01:40,235
Hi, Grandpa.

824
01:01:40,665 --> 01:01:42,965
You're still hanging
in there, I see.

825
01:01:44,035 --> 01:01:49,746
Oh, hi sweetheart. Your mother
was with me today.

826
01:01:50,499 --> 01:01:53,216
Did you see her?

827
01:01:55,987 --> 01:02:00,818
- No. - I told her I was
afraid to leave you.

828
01:02:01,798 --> 01:02:04,519
...but she promised

829
01:02:04,519 --> 01:02:09,070
that she'd look after you.
- Well, I'm sure she meant that.

830
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:14,321
- Patricia, darling...

831
01:02:15,488 --> 01:02:18,405
You've forgiven me, haven't you?

832
01:02:27,733 --> 01:02:32,274
- What do you need to be
forgiven for, daddy?

833
01:02:34,554 --> 01:02:38,565
 - Well, those things.
You know, the things I did.

834
01:02:39,015 --> 01:02:42,615
- All you ever did
was take care of me.

835
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:47,636
- Always looked after me.
- Weren't you afraid of me?

836
01:02:48,406 --> 01:02:52,437
No, daddy, not.

837
01:02:52,441 --> 01:02:56,617
I know how you get sometimes
you get little mixed up.

838
01:02:57,038 --> 01:03:02,669
You feel responsible for the
things that you didn't do.

839
01:03:02,969 --> 01:03:05,949
So I wasn't the one
that hurt you?

840
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:10,680
No sir, that wasn't you.

841
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:14,251
I hope it wasn't true.

842
01:03:14,651 --> 01:03:20,672
Patricia, darling.
I've always loved you.

843
01:03:23,732 --> 01:03:34,214
Daddy, you can feel free to leave,
whenever you're ready.

844
01:03:36,095 --> 01:03:40,655
Do you know that?
That's okay.

845
01:03:41,265 --> 01:03:44,216
There is nothing to fear.

846
01:03:58,628 --> 01:03:59,669
Come on.

847
01:04:00,129 --> 01:04:03,139
Let's get outa here.

848
01:04:04,819 --> 01:04:11,861
Is Patricia your mom?
What happened to her?

849
01:04:12,511 --> 01:04:14,041
She left a while ago.

850
01:04:14,999 --> 01:04:16,592
You mean she died?

851
01:04:21,362 --> 01:04:24,823
How did she die?

852
01:04:27,543 --> 01:04:31,784
My father left when I was a kid.
I don't really remember him.

853
01:04:33,604 --> 01:04:37,815
It was always the three of us,
mother and grandpa and I together

854
01:04:37,815 --> 01:04:40,406
in his house.

855
01:04:43,516 --> 01:04:46,737
I found her... on the floor.

856
01:04:51,407 --> 01:04:53,708
She'd taken enough pills...

857
01:04:57,829 --> 01:05:02,439
and grandpa at that moment,
kinda of lost it...

858
01:05:02,809 --> 01:05:04,210
* For Henry *

859
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,130
I sat with grandpa
on the porch, and

860
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:12,181
and we watched as they
came and took her away.

861
01:05:12,756 --> 01:05:14,399
How old were you?

862
01:05:18,472 --> 01:05:21,803
Seven.

863
01:05:23,413 --> 01:05:25,933
I don't know for sure,
but I...

864
01:05:27,134 --> 01:05:31,454
think my mother was young
when something happened.

865
01:05:31,654 --> 01:05:36,135
with her and grandpa.
- Were you afraid of it?

866
01:05:36,455 --> 01:05:37,675
No.

867
01:05:39,176 --> 01:05:42,686
Did she ever say
anything to you?

868
01:05:45,857 --> 01:05:47,457
No.

869
01:05:48,457 --> 01:05:53,858
But looking back on it, I think she
protected me in her own way.

870
01:05:54,642 --> 01:05:55,897
How?

871
01:05:59,729 --> 01:06:02,950
She made me lock
my door at night.

872
01:06:29,874 --> 01:06:33,545
The park is now empty and bare,
with an abandoned chain

873
01:06:35,335 --> 01:06:39,386
The jungle Jim, the slide and
swing  have rusted together.

874
01:06:40,656 --> 01:06:43,227
They're all so terribly alone now.

875
01:06:43,927 --> 01:06:45,547
Where did all the children go?

876
01:06:46,417 --> 01:06:48,647
Didn't they know that
the park needed them?

877
01:06:49,908 --> 01:06:54,588
The child's intelligent heart can find 'em
in the depth of many dark places.

878
01:06:56,749 --> 01:06:59,989
I cannot find 'em, the delicate
moment of its own detachment.

879
01:07:15,802 --> 01:07:18,513
- Hi Mr. Barthes.
- Hello Meredith.

880
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:22,624
- How's going?
- Fine, I am alright ...

881
01:07:23,583 --> 01:07:26,444
- I made a picture for you.

882
01:07:27,024 --> 01:07:28,314
Come here.

883
01:07:29,354 --> 01:07:31,425
- You did?
- Yeah

884
01:07:38,536 --> 01:07:43,967
Wow, it's beautiful, and it's a...
You're really talented.

885
01:07:44,797 --> 01:07:46,507
- Thanks. Have you been
doing this for a long time?

886
01:07:46,507 --> 01:07:49,518
Yeah, I've been doing it
since I was a kid.

887
01:07:51,138 --> 01:07:53,689
Faceless man in an empty room.

888
01:07:53,899 --> 01:07:55,519
Is that how you see me, Meredith?

889
01:07:56,049 --> 01:08:00,090
I don't know how I see you.

890
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:03,660
It's just how thought
of you in a situation.

891
01:08:04,070 --> 01:08:07,271
Do you ever think about who
your teachers are outside?

892
01:08:08,171 --> 01:08:10,261
- In real life?
- I guess so.

893
01:08:11,402 --> 01:08:14,982
- Does this place seem ureal to you?
- I watched you around the school,

894
01:08:16,472 --> 01:08:18,570
You always seem so sad

895
01:08:20,433 --> 01:08:27,934
Maybe you have a hard time with things
and you need someone to talk to

896
01:08:31,410 --> 01:08:33,825
- Meredith
- Yes Sir

897
01:08:38,661 --> 01:08:42,867
- Do you need someone to talk to?
- Yes, will you talk to me?

898
01:08:45,357 --> 01:08:49,648
When you talk to me, when you look
at me, it's like you really see me.

899
01:08:50,698 --> 01:08:53,059
I do see you Meredith

900
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:56,319
- Do you wanna go
see Dr. Parker?

901
01:08:56,329 --> 01:08:59,170
- Oh come on, don't pull me off

902
01:08:59,069 --> 01:09:01,098
I am not, I am not ...

903
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:04,311
What can I do?

904
01:09:05,781 --> 01:09:08,771
It's like you said, we're...

905
01:09:08,471 --> 01:09:13,882
There is nothing left. Nothing but
to realize how fucked up things are...

906
01:09:12,592 --> 01:09:16,293
It's not enough. I won't last.

907
01:09:17,023 --> 01:09:19,723
Listen to me. Just listen.

908
01:09:22,144 --> 01:09:24,724
We're all the same.

909
01:09:24,734 --> 01:09:27,275
We all feel pain.

910
01:09:27,295 --> 01:09:32,986
We all have chaos
in our lives.

911
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,396
Life is very, very
confusing, I know.

912
01:09:36,796 --> 01:09:40,617
I don't have the answers,
but I know if you write it out

913
01:09:41,707 --> 01:09:44,157
It'll all be okay.

914
01:09:45,048 --> 01:09:49,328
- Mr. Barthes, do you like me?
- Of course I do.

915
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:01,070
- Meredith, please don't.
You know I'd like to help you.

916
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:03,721
- Please, please.
- No, no.

917
01:10:03,821 --> 01:10:07,161
- You don't ...
- You said you liked me, please...

918
01:10:08,172 --> 01:10:09,292
Please, please...

919
01:10:09,352 --> 01:10:11,912
Oh please,
don't push me away.

920
01:10:11,912 --> 01:10:16,913
Please, just hold on to me, and tell
me that everything's gonna be O.K.

921
01:10:16,113 --> 01:10:18,753
Everything is...
It is okay, please.

922
01:10:24,654 --> 01:10:29,095
- Please... no, no...
- Meredith, wait a second.

923
01:10:29,865 --> 01:10:31,916
- What's going on?
- What?

924
01:10:32,296 --> 01:10:33,836
- Meredith, Meredith
- What were you just doing?

925
01:10:34,376 --> 01:10:35,879
Meredith, I am sorry.

926
01:10:37,058 --> 01:10:38,509
- What were you doing?
- What?

927
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,027
What are you doing?

928
01:10:41,227 --> 01:10:43,438
- Excuse me?!
- You were just touching her.

929
01:10:43,708 --> 01:10:45,448
What do you ... what are
you insinuating?

930
01:10:45,448 --> 01:10:48,338
It is inappropriate to be in here
alone with that young girl.

931
01:10:48,338 --> 01:10:50,729
It is inappropriate?!
She needed someone to talk to.

932
01:10:50,729 --> 01:10:54,159
- What do you think I'm doing, lady?
- I don't know what you're doing.

933
01:10:54,610 --> 01:10:55,800
"Just make me close."

934
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:58,350
What do you think I am fucking pervert?
Is that what you're insinuating?

935
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:00,380
She needed someone
to talk to her.

936
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:03,721
- Than why were you touching her?
- I wasn't touching her.

937
01:11:03,871 --> 01:11:05,541
"It's alright my dear."

938
01:11:08,262 --> 01:11:09,792
"Patricia?"

939
01:11:10,131 --> 01:11:12,676
I'm not ... not a sick old man!

940
01:11:14,093 --> 01:11:16,123
Is that what you
think of me?

941
01:11:17,904 --> 01:11:19,804
Is that what you think?

942
01:11:20,994 --> 01:11:23,674
I just wanted to help her!

943
01:11:30,747 --> 01:11:32,964
- Get out! Excuse me! Excuse me!
- What am I supposed to think?

944
01:11:33,096 --> 01:11:35,186
You're supposed to...
Fuck into a fucking judgement!

945
01:11:52,139 --> 01:11:55,526
Hello, no he's not home.

946
01:12:19,654 --> 01:12:21,704
Hello Mr. Barthes.

947
01:12:23,935 --> 01:12:29,946
Whenever you feel like you are ready
we do have some paperwork downstairs

948
01:12:30,186 --> 01:12:32,006
that we need you to
take care of.

949
01:12:37,755 --> 01:12:39,353
I am sorry.

950
01:13:24,715 --> 01:13:27,716
I wish things were different.

951
01:13:28,886 --> 01:13:36,277
I tried, you know... Fuck...
The things is... We all...

952
01:13:41,128 --> 01:13:43,878
We all have problems. We all
have things that we're dealing with.

953
01:13:44,819 --> 01:13:47,919
Some days were better than others.
Somedays were not so great.

954
01:13:47,919 --> 01:13:52,720
Some days we have
limited space

955
01:13:52,830 --> 01:13:54,680
for others.

956
01:14:10,413 --> 01:14:13,243
Hey. I made breakfast.

957
01:14:14,353 --> 01:14:16,202
Want some milk?

958
01:14:18,594 --> 01:14:22,655
These kids need something else.

959
01:14:24,994 --> 01:14:27,091
They don't need me.

960
01:14:33,277 --> 01:14:35,947
- Are you O.K?
- Yeah, I'm not hungry.

961
01:14:46,119 --> 01:14:50,350
- You know, you can't
keep living on the street.

962
01:14:50,370 --> 01:14:53,330
I am not. I mean, I'm staying
here with you.

963
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:56,151
You can't continue
to stay here with me.

964
01:14:56,521 --> 01:14:59,241
- I'm not good for you.
- That's not true.

965
01:14:59,981 --> 01:15:03,232
You're the only family
I've ever had.

966
01:15:03,822 --> 01:15:06,042
Well, I can't be your family.

967
01:15:13,114 --> 01:15:16,164
I can't give you what you need.

968
01:15:25,226 --> 01:15:28,286
- You have to understand,
you should be... - You are good...

969
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:31,124
And gentle ...

970
01:15:32,557 --> 01:15:34,637
You're the most kind.

971
01:15:39,718 --> 01:15:42,719
I love you Henry.

972
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:52,190
- Come in. -Hi.
- Hi.

973
01:15:53,361 --> 01:15:54,601
Hello there.

974
01:15:56,161 --> 01:16:00,132
- Erica ...
- Don't let them take me...

975
01:16:00,232 --> 01:16:01,672
Please...

976
01:16:03,062 --> 01:16:05,153
- Noo...
- Listen, you should...

977
01:16:05,253 --> 01:16:09,063
You are all
that I have, please...

978
01:16:09,873 --> 01:16:13,084
- Don't let me go.
- You should go, sorry.

979
01:16:13,084 --> 01:16:15,919
- No, no ...
- No, don't do this ...

980
01:16:16,599 --> 01:16:17,631
- Henry! Henry!
- You should go

981
01:16:17,815 --> 01:16:19,325
- Henry!
- You have to let go.

982
01:16:19,328 --> 01:16:21,401
- Henry!
- You have to ...

983
01:16:22,336 --> 01:16:24,976
- Henry!
- You have to leg go now.

984
01:16:24,973 --> 01:16:27,062
Henry!

985
01:16:27,366 --> 01:16:29,577
- Her things?
- Yeah.

986
01:16:29,631 --> 01:16:32,504
- Henry! Henry!
- Come on.

987
01:16:34,278 --> 01:16:36,988
- No! No! ...
- Things will be okay.

988
01:16:37,768 --> 01:16:39,598
Don't do this.

989
01:16:39,598 --> 01:16:43,319
- You gonna be okay.
- No! No! No!

990
01:16:43,715 --> 01:16:46,369
No! ...

991
01:17:35,248 --> 01:17:37,478
Well ... I feel
just awful for her.

992
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:40,919
- For who?
- For our school.

993
01:17:41,769 --> 01:17:47,620
It may sound strange but I've always
felt that the school had a spirit.

994
01:17:48,398 --> 01:17:52,002
It's not just an budgetful buildings,
but they're alive.

995
01:17:56,882 --> 01:18:00,482
I just can't understand it.
Where are all the parents?

996
01:18:04,672 --> 01:18:06,208
I don't know.

997
01:18:11,864 --> 01:18:15,385
I was in my room for two
hours and saw one parent.

998
01:18:15,395 --> 01:18:17,395
Where are they?
Where is everybody?

999
01:18:17,695 --> 01:18:20,396
- We don't know.
- It's uncanny.

1000
01:18:20,866 --> 01:18:24,266
No air raid sirensl
No bombs.

1001
01:18:24,496 --> 01:18:25,967
It doesn't happen that way.

1002
01:18:26,497 --> 01:18:30,117
It starts in whisper,
then nothing.

1003
01:18:30,357 --> 01:18:32,388
We had our music once,
didn't we?

1004
01:18:33,205 --> 01:18:34,497
Yes, we did.

1005
01:18:37,539 --> 01:18:40,509
Do you remember those nights
we only had two parents at a time?

1006
01:18:40,809 --> 01:18:43,170
And then there were more,
there were many more

1007
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:48,180
waiting in the waiting rooms.

1008
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:50,061
And halls were full of joy and
celebration. Now, it's nothing.

1009
01:18:50,211 --> 01:18:53,901
Rememberance. The things passed.

1010
01:18:54,111 --> 01:18:56,402
I actually felt quite at home.

1011
01:18:56,702 --> 01:18:58,272
There were no parents.

1012
01:18:59,012 --> 01:19:04,093
I thought how appropriate.
It was like, a moment of insight

1013
01:19:05,253 --> 01:19:09,504
the reality of the fucking
problem in the first place.

1014
01:19:14,535 --> 01:19:19,586
Some of us believe that
we can make a difference.

1015
01:19:20,656 --> 01:19:23,296
And sometimes we wake up

1016
01:19:26,227 --> 01:19:28,057
and we realize we've failed.

1017
01:19:40,019 --> 01:19:42,520
Hi it's Gretchen
calling from the Clinic,

1018
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,090
Erica Loius has her
test results back.

1019
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:48,171
Please give us a call
at your earliest convenience.

1020
01:19:48,168 --> 01:19:48,984
Thank you.

1021
01:20:14,533 --> 01:20:17,234
" - You have good parents "
" - Bitch you shut up. "

1022
01:20:17,234 --> 01:20:19,521
"A Mother of mine gave her ... "

1023
01:20:20,021 --> 01:20:23,577
" A Diet Bitch! "
" ha ha...ha ha ... ha ha"

1024
01:20:25,177 --> 01:20:27,397
" What is all this supposed to be?
Your tortured soul?"

1025
01:20:32,068 --> 01:20:34,715
" - I won't stand that, Dad! "
" - Paint something more cheerful ..."

1026
01:20:34,875 --> 01:20:39,668
" We have to pay us our lives ..."
" Grow like your hair, lost some weight"

1027
01:20:39,669 --> 01:20:41,010
" It'll all be okay "

1028
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:45,380
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

1029
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:47,601
Before we take roll,

1030
01:20:47,601 --> 01:20:52,642
I want to tell you that today
will be my last day with you.

1031
01:20:53,692 --> 01:20:55,752
You're gonna have
a permanent teacher on Monday.

1032
01:20:55,852 --> 01:20:58,503
- Where are you going, Mr. Barthes?
- I'll go to another school.

1033
01:20:59,933 --> 01:21:04,294
- We will miss you, man.
- Yeah?

1034
01:21:04,294 --> 01:21:07,054
All those teachers in
this place... They're dickheads.

1035
01:21:07,832 --> 01:21:10,577
Don't you get tired of
moving around all the time?

1036
01:21:10,775 --> 01:21:16,486
It's how my job works. I come
in here for a period of time,

1037
01:21:16,486 --> 01:21:18,516
so you don't have twnenty
subs in and I'm outa here,

1038
01:21:18,526 --> 01:21:23,527
and then, you have a
permanent teacher come in

1039
01:21:23,547 --> 01:21:25,817
and I leave.

1040
01:21:27,588 --> 01:21:32,549
Attention to all teachers, this is an special
announcement from the Principle's Office.

1041
01:21:33,779 --> 01:21:36,769
There will an all faculty meeting
today, during nutrition"

1042
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:40,200
Student nutrition will be extended

1043
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:43,450
a ten minutes, thank you.

1044
01:22:28,248 --> 01:22:33,779
I invited you here today
to discuss the status things.

1045
01:22:34,299 --> 01:22:38,330
I know that there wasn't ...
I know that there isn't ...

1046
01:22:46,151 --> 01:22:49,842
- I am sorry ...
- We all need something,

1047
01:22:50,442 --> 01:22:57,213
to destract us from the
complexity and reality.

1048
01:22:58,113 --> 01:23:01,014
More or less to think about
where that came from?

1049
01:23:01,904 --> 01:23:08,415
No one wants to think about
the struggle that it takes

1050
01:23:08,445 --> 01:23:11,445
to become somebody
to get out of

1051
01:23:15,555 --> 01:23:17,390
... to get out of the ...

1052
01:23:18,057 --> 01:23:20,757
the sea of pain that,
we all have to get out of.

1053
01:23:30,769 --> 01:23:32,359
- Hi Meredith.
- Hi.

1054
01:23:34,479 --> 01:23:36,510
Haven't seen you
in class lately?

1055
01:23:37,293 --> 01:23:38,818
Where have you been?

1056
01:23:39,310 --> 01:23:41,751
- Baking.
- I see.

1057
01:23:42,921 --> 01:23:45,461
- I am happy I get to see you.
Today is my last day.

1058
01:23:46,571 --> 01:23:49,232
How ironic!

1059
01:23:49,902 --> 01:23:53,733
Listen, I was thinking,
I bought this for myself, but

1060
01:23:54,713 --> 01:23:58,994
maybe you could make
better use of it.

1061
01:24:10,916 --> 01:24:13,706
- I like that one the best.
- You can't have that one.

1062
01:24:14,206 --> 01:24:15,916
It's mine.

1063
01:24:17,447 --> 01:24:20,747
But, can you have this one?

1064
01:24:21,137 --> 01:24:23,638
- It's better for you anyway.
- Thanks.

1065
01:24:24,988 --> 01:24:26,628
I am sorry.

1066
01:24:28,249 --> 01:24:31,809
If I hurt you
in any way, I um ...

1067
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:40,431
I know that its tough
right now, for you,

1068
01:24:40,391 --> 01:24:45,391
but it's not always gonna be this...
- Goodbye Mr. Barthes.

1069
01:24:50,012 --> 01:24:52,043
Goodbye Meredith.

1070
01:25:35,570 --> 01:25:39,841
They say that suicide is a permanent
solution to the temporary problem.

1071
01:25:40,801 --> 01:25:42,671
I'll let you know?

1072
01:25:45,092 --> 01:25:48,612
My name is Meredith and
I wanted to kill myself.

1073
01:26:20,558 --> 01:26:22,178
Meredith!

1074
01:26:23,268 --> 01:26:24,128
No!

1075
01:26:26,479 --> 01:26:28,329
Henry!

1076
01:26:30,679 --> 01:26:34,100
It's gonna be O.K.
It's gonna be O.K.

1077
01:26:36,841 --> 01:26:40,441
It's gonna be O.K.

1078
01:26:44,332 --> 01:26:52,633
We have such a responsibility to guide
our young so that they don't end up

1079
01:26:53,593 --> 01:26:56,254
falling apart.

1080
01:26:57,625 --> 01:26:59,514
Falling by the way side.

1081
01:27:02,821 --> 01:27:05,401
Becoming insignificant.

1082
01:28:26,957 --> 01:28:29,589
I realized something today.

1083
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:37,111
I'm a non-person, Sarah.

1084
01:28:39,962 --> 01:28:46,023
You shouldn't be here.
I am not here.

1085
01:28:48,333 --> 01:28:51,023
You may see me,

1086
01:28:52,814 --> 01:28:57,815
but I'm hollow.

1087
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:35,551
Failing. We're failing.

1088
01:29:38,452 --> 01:29:45,263
Failed in a sense that we
have let everyone down.

1089
01:29:45,958 --> 01:29:47,807
Including ourselves.

1090
01:30:57,445 --> 01:31:00,996
When you're walking down
the hallway, or in your classroom,

1091
01:31:01,496 --> 01:31:04,896
how many of you

1092
01:31:05,696 --> 01:31:11,968
have ever felt the weight
pressing down on you?

1093
01:31:13,578 --> 01:31:15,838
I have.

1094
01:31:19,269 --> 01:31:21,399
Everyone?

1095
01:31:22,479 --> 01:31:23,530
Wow!

1096
01:31:23,650 --> 01:31:27,800
Poe wrote about these
things over a 100 years ago.

1097
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:31,661
So, as we read

1098
01:31:31,911 --> 01:31:35,101
we can see that

1099
01:31:35,122 --> 01:31:38,502
"The House of Usher"
is not merely an old

1100
01:31:39,022 --> 01:31:41,933
decrapped castle...

1101
01:31:43,263 --> 01:31:46,964
It is also a state of being.

1102
01:31:53,114 --> 01:31:57,234
" During the whole of dull, dark and soundless day "

1103
01:31:57,469 --> 01:32:02,878
" In the autumn of that year, when the clouds
hung oppressively low in heavens, "

1104
01:32:04,479 --> 01:32:07,763
" I had been passing alone, on the horseback, "
