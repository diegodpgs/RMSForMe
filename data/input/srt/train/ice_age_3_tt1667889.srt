1
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,300 

2
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,500

3
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,300
It's happening!

4
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,800
Wait up guys!

5
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,100
- It's coming! it's coming! I'm having a baby.
- code blue, code blue, 

6
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:34,600
- or a pig if it's a girl
- Having a baby! having a baby! I'm coming, Ellie!

7
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,800
- Ellie? Ellie, Where are you, Where am I.
- Manny!

8
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,700
I told you! It was just a kick.

9
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,500
Ohh right! Right, oh wow.

10
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,200
Ohh you really gave daddy a scare!
Daddy got silly.

11
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:14,300
daddy fall down cliff and go, 
boom, boom, boom. Silly daddy.

12
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,200
Sorry, folks. False alarm.
It was just a kick.

13
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:29,600
- Do you know who I want to kick?
- That's the third false alarm this week.

14
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:36,100
- Oh I see someone else who has a bun in the oven?
- I'm not pregnant!

15
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,400
Too bad, you'd make 
a wonderful mother.

16
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,400
Manny I know your excited, I am too, 
but your getting a little carried away.

17
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,700
Okay. Okay. boy, your
starting to sound like Diego.

18
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,400
Wait a second... Where is Diego?

19
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,400
My hooves are burning 
baby, they are burning!

20
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,900
Look at this, I can tip-toe!
Eat my dust, Diego!

21
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,100
- Now, can I look now?
- Easy don't freak out the baby.

22
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,000
The baby is fine. It's the freaked 
out daddy I'm worried about.

23
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,100
Ah-uh-uh, No peeking.

24
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,900
- A playground for junior.
- Ohh wow!

25
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,100
It's amazing.

26
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:40,500
- Ohh Manny...
- I made it myself, our family.

27
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,600
Hey why aren't I up there?

28
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,900
- You can be on ours.
- you'd fit right in.

29
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:57,100
Ofcourse it's still work in progress.
few rough edges, here and there.

30
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:03,200
- I don't believe it, your trying to baby proof nature.
- baby proof nature? get outta here.

31
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,000
That's ridiculous.

32
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,700
Manny, this is the world our baby's 
gonna grow up in. You can't change that.

33
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:16,400
Of course I can, I'm the 
biggest thing on earth.

34
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Okay big daddy, I can't wait to see, 
how you handle the teen years.

35
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,000
Come on, Sid. I don't want you
touching anything. This place is for kids.

36
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:33,300
Are you a kid?
Don't answer that.

37
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,700
Diego, there you are.
You missed the big surprise.

38
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,700
- I'l check it out later.
- Okay, See ya.

39
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,700
- You know, I think there's something bothering, Diego.
- No, I'm sure everything's fine.

40
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,000
- You should talk to him.
- Guys don't talk to guys, about guys problems.

41
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,700
- We just punch each other on the shoulders.
- That's stupid!

42
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:09,100
To a girl, but for a guy, that's
like six months of therapy.

43
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,800
Okay, Okay I'm going.

44
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,400
- Hey.
- Oww!

45
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,600
- Why'd you do that?
- I don't know.

46
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:30,600
So listen, Ellie thinks theres 
something bothering you...

47
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:36,400
Actually, I've been thinking, that soon, 
it might be time for me to head out.

48
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,400
Okay, so I'l just tell her that 
your fine. It was nothing.

49
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:48,100
Look who we kidding, Manny? I'm losing my edge.
I'm not really built to chaperoning play dates.

50
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,900
Having a family, that's huge.
And I'm happy for you, but...

51
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,600
- ...It's your adventure, not mine.
- So you don't want to be around my kid?

52
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,600
No, no, no. your taking 
this the wrong way.

53
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,200
No go, go find some adventure.
Mr adventure guy!

54
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,600
Don't let my boring domestic life 
hit you on the bottom, on your way out.

55
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Isn't Ellie supposed to be the 
one with the hormonal imbalance?

56
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,500
Manny, wait! Nobody has to leave.

57
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,400
- So?
- That's why guys don't talk to guys.

58
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:23,700
- Why what happened.
- Diego's leaving.

59
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,300
Whoa, whoa, this should be the best 
time of our lives. we're having a baby.

60
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:35,400
- No, Sid. They're havin a baby
- Yeah but, we're a herd. We're a family

61
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,600
Look things have changed.
Manny has other priority's now.

62
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,700
Face  it, Sid. We had a great run,
but... now it's time to move on.

63
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,400
- So it's just the two of us.
- No, Sid. It's not the two of us.

64
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,000
Crash and Eddie, are coming with us?

65
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,600
Just, Crash?
Just, Eddie?

66
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,800
Goodbye, Sid.

67
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Okay, calm down. Calm down.
I'm good at making friends.

68
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll make my own herd.
That's what I'll do!

69
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:29,200
Hey! Me amigo's. Que pasa?

70
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,100
Well, atleast you still got your looks.

71
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,300
Ohh great!!

72
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,800
Anybody here?

73
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,900
Hello?

74
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,200
Oh poor guys. I know what
it feels like, to be abandoned.

75
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:43,100
Don't worry,
you're not alone anymore.

76
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,400
There you go.

77
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,200
Stay here! You take care of your brother
now, momma's coming right back.

78
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,600
Momma's coming, baby!

79
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,200
I got you.

80
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,700
What did I just tell you kids?

81
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,900
Ohh, thank you, thank you, 
thank you!

82
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Bad eggs, rotten eggs. A heart 
attack you almost gave me.

83
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:04,100
Ohh I'm sorry darling, it's 
just that I love you so much.

84
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,300
Hello!

85
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,800
I'd like to present, Eggbert,
Chelly and Joko.

86
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,700
Sid, whatever you're doing.
it's a bad idea!

87
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,600
- My kids'll, hear you.
- They're not your kids, Sid. Take them back.

88
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,300
- Your not meant to be a parent.
- Why not? - First sign, stealing someone else's egg.

89
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,900
Second sign, one of them 
almost became an omelet.

90
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:33,700
- Someone must be worried sick looking for them.
- No, they were underground, in ice.

91
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:38,900
If it wasn't for me they'd be... 
Egg sickles.

92
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:44,200
Sid, I know what your going through.
Your going to have a family to someday.

93
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:50,400
Your gonna meet a nice girl, with low 
standards, no real options, or sense of smell.

94
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:55,100
- What Manny means to say is...
- I get it. I'll take them back.

95
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:00,200
You have your family and I'm 
better off alone. By myself.

96
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,900
a fortress of solitude.

97
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,500
In the ice, for ever!

98
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,500
Alone, lonely loner..

99
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,200
- That's alot of aloners.
- Precisely!

100
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:21,900
- Sid, wait.
- No, no, it's ok. He'll bounce back, it's one of the advantages of being, Sid.

101
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,100
Why sould I take you back.
I love kids.

102
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:41,400
I'm responsible, loving, nurturing. 
What do you think?

103
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,900
I knew you would agree.

104
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:54,200
Oh oh, don't cry!
I'll find a dry place.

105
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,300
Let me just dry you off.

106
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,900
I don't know, being 
a parents, alot of work.

107
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,200
Maybe I'm not ready.

108
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:49,100
Mamma, mamma, mamma!

109
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,300
I'm a mommy.

110
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,500
Where's mommy?

111
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,600
Here I am!

112
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,800
There you go, nice clean faces.

113
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,000
I got it! I got it!

114
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,900
Stop it, no.

115
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,000
Hey, no biting!

116
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:44,100
I'm sorry, no, it's okay, it's okay.
Don't cry! Why you still crying?

117
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:50,000
Are you hungry? Maybe your 
hungry. I know just the thing.

118
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,300
<i> I am an animal </ i>

119
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:00,600
<i> I am your child
This is my milk </ i>

120
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,700
I thought you were a female!

121
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm sorry, but you can't go in. 
Manny says, It's just for kids.

122
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,100
Wait a minute...
You are kids!

123
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,200
Just don't break anything!

124
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:47,500
- The Sloth says the playground's open!
- No, wait. Not for everyone!!

125
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,500
No, no. don't touch that!

126
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,000
- What are they?
- Who cares? Their fun!

127
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,200
- Mommy, his not sharing.
- Aren't you gonna do something. - Why my kid had it first.

128
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,800
- Did not!
- Did to!

129
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:20,500
- What is the matter with you?
- I'm a single mother with three kids.

130
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,200
- No don't!
- No, don't! Stop.

131
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:33,400
- Ronald!
- Whoa! that's insane.

132
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,700
Stop! Stop! Stop!

133
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:47,000
- Hold on,  Little Johnny!
- I'm trying!

134
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,300
You know, experts say that you should
let the kids eat whatever they want.

135
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:58,800
- Do you think my ankles look fat?
- Ankles. What ankles?

136
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,500
Ronald, Where did you come from?

137
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,300
Oh No!!

138
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,900
Okay come on spit him out!
If you don't spit out, Little Johnny,

139
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,800
- we're leaving the playground 
this instant. One...

140
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,500
...two .. Don't make me say three.

141
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,700
- There we are, a picture of health.
- That's not little Johnny.

142
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,700
- Well better than nothing.
- Madison!

143
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,300
- Come on, barf him up!
- Sid!

144
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:38,700
- Hello, Manny.
- Little Johnny!

145
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,500
Oh wait... No! no! 

146
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,800
Oh I'm really sorry.

147
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:58,800
- This place is totalled.
- And we didn't reck it. - we're losing our touch bro!

148
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,100
The important thing is that no 
one got hurt. Except for that guy.

149
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:08,100
And, and those three... and her.

150
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,400
I told you to take them back, and
you kept them! Now look what they've done.

151
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,200
- Okay granted, we do have some discipline issues.
- Eating kids is not a discipline issue.

152
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,900
- But he spit them out!
- Well that's super, lets give him a gold star!

153
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:31,000
They don't belong here, Sid. Whatever they are
wherever you found them, take them back.

154
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,900
Manny, I'm not getting rid of my kids!

155
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,000
Earthquake!

156
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,300
It's Okay, It's okay, mamma's here!

157
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,200
Do earthquakes, shriek?

158
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:18,800
- I thought those guys were extinct.
- Well that is one angry fossil. Sid!

159
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,800
Come on, inside, inside, inside.

160
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,300
Nobody move a muscle!

161
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,800
No, no, no, don't cry.

162
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,500
We are poor little lambs
who have lost our way.

163
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,600
Baah, baaah!
Ahhhh!!!

164
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:37,300
- Sid! give them to her. She's their mother.
- How do I know, she's their mother?

165
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:44,300
- What do you want a birth certificate? She's a dinosaur!
- Well I've put in the, blood, sweat! I've raised them.

166
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:50,100
- For a day! Give them back, you Lunatic!
- Look these are my kids!

167
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:55,600
And your gonna have to go 
through me to get them!

168
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,400
- Sid!
- Help!

169
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:14,400
- Run!
- Don't you have anything better to do?

170
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,700
- Help!
- Sid?

171
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,700
- Sid must be down there.
- Well, his dead!

172
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:43,500
- He will be missed.
- Oh no, no, no. Not so fast.

173
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,300
Hey Ellie, this is where I draw the line.
You, Crash and Eddie back to the village.

174
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:53,800
- Yeah that's gonna happen.
- Ellie! You saw that thing? This is gonna be dangerous.

175
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:59,700
- Talk to the trunk.
- Oh great, after we save Sid! I'm gonna kill him.

176
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:06,200
- Ladies first.
- Age before beauty? - No pain no gain!

177
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,900
- Sid?
- Sid?

178
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:33,700
Oh no, no, no! Not good. Not good.

179
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,700
 Ellie! Ellie! Wait up!

180
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:46,400
Okay look, if you feel anything, 
even if it's nothing. You gotta tell me. And we're outta here.

181
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:51,400
We need a code word:
"yeah, something that says, the babies coming."

182
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,200
How bout, Ahh, 
the babies coming. How's that?

183
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:01,700
Too long. We need something 
short and punchy. Like a... Peaches.

184
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:06,800
- Peaches?
- I love peaches, they sweet and round and fuzzy.

185
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,700
- Just like you.
- You think I'm round?

186
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:15,700
Round is good.
Round is, foxy!

187
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,300
Stay close.

188
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,800
- Are you guys havin the same dream I am?
- We've been living above an entire world.

189
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:56,100
And we didn't even know it.

190
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,600
Run for it! Hurry.

191
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:30,500
- Diego, what are you doing here?
- Sight seeing. Looking for Sid, same as you!

192
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:36,100
- Well aren't you noble.
- This is not the time guys. We need all the help we can get!

193
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,900
Never mind!

194
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:02,000
Here, boy. Here, come on!

195
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,800
- Are you nuts! we're not getting on that thing!
- It's either this dinosaur, or that one!

196
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,900
Pregnant lady, wants a lift.
Yabba, dabba, Do!

197
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,200
Don't ever, yabba, dabba, do that again!

198
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:38,700
- I feel so... puny.
- How do you think I feel?

199
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,200
Ouch!

200
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,700
Take cover!

201
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:53,600
Dude, your awesome!
Your like the brother I never had. Me too.

202
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,000
Can we keep him?

203
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,700
Buck. The name's Buck.
Short for, Buck-meister.

204
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,300
Long for, buh!

205
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,900
A little dull.

206
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:25,100
- What are you doing here?
- A friend was taken by a dinosaur.

207
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:30,800
Well his dead. Welcome
to my world. Now, uh, go home.

208
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,300
- Off you pop!
- Not without, Sid. - Ellie wait, maybe the deranged hermit has a point

209
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:42,000
- Manny! We came this far, we're gonna find him.
- I got tracks.

210
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,600
Let's go.

211
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:51,700
If you go in there, you'll find 
your friend... in the after-life!

212
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:56,200
How do you know? Oh 
great and wisely, weasely one.

213
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:09,400
Mummy dinosaur carrying three babies, 
and some sloppy green thing?

214
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,300
- Yeah, we're friends with the floppy green thing.
- You got all that from the tracks?

215
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,900
No, not really. I saw them come through 
here earlier. She's headed for Lava Falls.

216
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,700
That's where they care, for the newborns.

217
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,700
To get there! you got to go 
through the jungle of misery.

218
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,500
Across the chasm of death.

219
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:34,600
- To the plates of wow.
- Whoa!!!

220
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:41,300
Okay! Good luck with the slow decadence 
to madness, we're gonna go now.

221
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:50,000
Do you think this is some tropical get-away?
You can't protect your mate! mate!.

222
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:56,400
What are you gonna do with those 
flimsy tusks..? when you run into the beast.

223
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,800
I call him "Rudy".

224
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:07,300
Oh good. Good. I was worried it was
something intimidating, like, Sheldon or Tim.

225
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,400
- Wait! You mean there's something bigger than mummy dinosaur..?
- Aye!

226
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,000
- Aye?
- Aye! Aye!

227
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,100
- His the one that gave me this?
- Wow, he gave you that patch.

228
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:24,400
- For free? That's so cool.
- Yeah, maybe he'll give us one too.

229
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,900
Welcome to my world.

230
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:41,500
- Abandon all hope, he who enters there!
- Alright we get it. Doom and despair. Yadda, yadda, yadda.

231
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:56,300
Sounds like a jungle of misery to me.

232
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,300
- Hold on.
- Why, what's wrong? Peaches?

233
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:16,600
- No, it's just I got a funny feeling.
- You're hungry. Low blood sugar!

234
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,200
- There's some fruit. - No, Manny!
- I wouldn't do that, if I were you.

235
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:27,900
- This isn't exactly your playground.
- Like I'm going to be afraid of a pretty flower.

236
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:34,200
- Bet you didn't see that coming?
- Manny?

237
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,300
Fot the record, I blame you for this.

238
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,600
Stop eating our friends, plant!

239
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:52,200
- That's it, I'm tearing it up, from the roots.
- Do that and it'll clamp-shut forever.

240
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:58,400
Alright, preggers. Don't get your trunk in a knot. 
I'll have them out of there before they're digested.

241
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,900
They'll be nothing but bones in 3 minutes. 
Well maybe 5 for the fat one! - I'm not fat!

242
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,100
- I feel tingly.
- Don't say that, when your pressed up against me. 

243
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:13,900
- Not that kind of tingly.
- I can feel it too.

244
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,300
- Help, someone help us! 
- Hurry!

245
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:21,300
It's time to get... Buck wild.

246
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,800
Who's fat now?

247
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,400
No!

248
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,500
- Tourists.
- Puked on by a plant. Awesome!

249
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:44,700
- Say something.
- Thank's for saving us.

250
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,500
- Will you help us find the floppy green thing?
- That's not necessary. - Yes it is.

251
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:57,500
Alright I'l help ya. But I got
rules. Rule number one:

252
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,300
Always listen to Buck.
Rule number two:

253
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:06,800
Stay in the middle of the trail.
Rule number three:

254
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,400
He who has gas, travels 
at the back of the pack.

255
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,500
- Come on then, chop, chop!
- We should all have our heads examined.

256
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:26,600
That's rule number four.
Now, let's go find your friend.

257
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,300
Oh it's okay, it's okay. Don't 
worry, we're gonna be fine.

258
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:52,800
Please swing a little more to...?

259
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:01,000
See, she's putting us down...

260
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:05,300
No! I'm too young to be eaten.

261
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Wow! Nice mucus. And I 
don't care for, everyone.

262
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,000
Listen these things get complicated. 
Maybe we can work something out.

263
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,100
I can have them on Sundays to Tuesdays?
Wednesdays to Fridays? Weekends!

264
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,800
It's Okay, mommas okay!

265
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,200
If you eat me, it will send a bad message.

266
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,900
Ha! Score one for the sloth!

267
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,200
And the scores all tied up.

268
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:12,000
- Do you think the beast will find, Sid?
- Or more importantly, us?

269
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:19,400
Rudy? Are you joking? He's relentless.
He knows all, sees all eats all.

270
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,900
So that's a, yes.

271
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,800
Hey, get off my lawn! Go on shoo!!

272
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,600
I knew that guy when he was a, 
caterpillar. You know, before he came out.

273
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:44,400
So your just living down here by your wits! 
All on your own, no responsibilities?

274
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:50,700
Not one! It's incredible. No dependence, 
no limits, the greatest life a single guy can have.

275
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,600
Did you hear that? This is my kind'a place.

276
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:59,500
Hello? No, I can't talk right now.
I'm trying to recover a dead sloth.

277
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:06,200
They following me.
I know! They think I'm crazy.

278
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:11,200
We're going into the chasm of death.
I'm gonna lose you. I love you too.

279
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:15,500
- Alright, goddbye. Bye, bye.
- Okay, follow me!

280
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,900
That's you in three weeks.

281
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:40,700
- So, why do they call it the chasm of death?
- Well we tried, 'big smelly crack',

282
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:45,200
- but uh, it just made everybody giggle.
- Well now what?

283
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,900
- Madam.
- She is not doing that.

284
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,500
Rule number one.

285
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,300
Come on, mammoth. Your supposed 
to have a good memory.

286
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,000
Always listen to, Buck.

287
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:12,200
Now! Eyes forward. Back straight... and uh, yes,

288
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,500
- Breathe in the toxic fumes and you'll probably die.
- Toxic fumes.

289
00:43:14,999 --> 00:43:19,700
- Just another day in paradise.
- Wait!

290
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,800
Geronimo!

291
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:38,100
- Ellie! you okay? - You have to try this. 
- Alright now pile on everyone, couldn't be easier.

292
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:49,700
Don't panic! Just some, technical 
difficulties. Keep holding it in boys.

293
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:59,300
- I can't take it anymore.
- He breathe it. And now I'm breathing it.

294
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:05,300
- Hey we're not dead.
- You sound ridiculous.

295
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,900
Me? You should hear you.

296
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,600
Alright. And, One, and two...

297
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:18,400
<i> - Christmas, Christmas time is here...</ i>
- Are you crazy?

298
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,500
It's not poison.

299
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,200
It's so disturbing.

300
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:37,500
- Stop laughing, all of you!
- "Stop laughing, all of you!"

301
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,800
What's rule number one?

302
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:50,000
- They're just laughing, what's so bad about that?
- They died laughing.

303
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,000
- Stop laughing!
- Do you know what's funny though?

304
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,700
We're trying to save, Sid and 
now we're all gonna die!

305
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,100
- And I don't even like, Sid.
- Who does? He's an idiot.

306
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Thank's for getting me into this mess.
It's the most fun I've had in years.

307
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,800
Thank you, for deserting the 
herd. That was totally super.

308
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,500
Stop that! don't you see?
We're all gonna die.

309
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,800
We gotta do everything, huh?

310
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:48,300
- Sometimes I wet my bed.
- That's alright. Sometimes I wet your bed.

311
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:04,200
- I'm not sure how much of that you could hear?
- Oh I heard all of it.

312
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,700
- You wet my bed?
- That was, gas talk dude!.

313
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:13,800
- Well, we better get moving.
- Aren't we forgetting something?

314
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,300
I'm so lonely.

315
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,100
Okay. Here you go guys...
Muncher, muncher.

316
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:52,100
What! your not gonna eat your vegetables?
How you going to become big and strong, dinosaurs?

317
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:03,300
No... I raised them vegetarian.
It's a healthier lifestyle I mean look at me.

318
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:08,800
Excuse me. I'm trying to 
have a conversation here.

319
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,200
No, no, no! That's not for us kids. 
Way to feathery and fleshy and.

320
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:22,300
...and alive!

321
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:33,600
No, no, no, we do not 
eat live animals, period.

322
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:37,600
Now go, fly. Be free.

323
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,000
Little, flightless bird.

324
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
- My bad.
- Hey, where you going?

325
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,600
This is how you resolve a conflict?
No wonder your single.

326
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,200
Oh come on. Am I talking to myself here?
I say they're vegetarian, you say, 'Grrrr' .

327
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:06,700
I say can we talk about this? you say, 
Grrrr. I don't call that communication.

328
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,400
See, that's your answer to everything.

329
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,700
What are you afraid of?
You're the biggest thing on, Earth.

330
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,900
Aren't you?

331
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:46,400
- They'll never survive, it's dangerous by day!
- But it's even worse at night.

332
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,100
- Plus the guide is a lunatic! What 
you mean, Buck? Oh his whack-o.

333
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:55,900
I am not. Totally bonkers! and his 
feet smell. Shut up! You shut up!

334
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,100
Oh you little...

335
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:03,500
- He's strangling his own foot.
- Shouldn't we get moving?

336
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:08,200
- And give, Rudy a midnight snack? Not likely.
- The skulls right, take a load of mammals.

337
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:15,000
We'll camp here. Now, who's hungry? 
I am. You don't need the calories!

338
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:24,400
There I was... My back 
against the wall. No way out.

339
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:32,700
Perched on a razor's edge of oblivion.
Staring into the eye, of the great white beast.

340
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:36,600
- Were you killed?
- Sadly, yes. But I lived.

341
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:43,200
Never had I felt so alive, than 
when I was so close... To death.

342
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:50,400
Just before, Rudy could suck me down his gullet. I grabbed 
hold of that, roast pink fleshy thing that dangles at the back of the throat.

343
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:58,100
I hung on to that sucker, and I 
swung back and forth, back and forth.

344
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:06,400
Back... and forth and back. And finally
I let go and shot right out of his mouth. 

345
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:11,200
I may have lost an eye that day.
But I got this.

346
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,100
Rudy's tooth...

347
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:20,600
It's like the old saying: "An eye for 
a tooth". A nose for a chin. A butt for a"...

348
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:25,000
- It's an old saying. But uh, it's not a very good one.
- You are super weasel.

349
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:29,000
- Ultra weasel.
- Diesel weasel.

350
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,700
What? He is.

351
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:38,500
Now let me tell you about the time I used 
to sharpen, clam-shell to turn a T-Rex,

352
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,800
- Into a T-Rex'ual.
- Yes master.

353
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:49,200
- That's enough fairy-tales for one night.
- Come on, Ellie. You should rest now...

354
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:54,000
- Alright, you guys get some shut-eye, I'll keep watch.
- Don't worry, Buck, we got this. 

355
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:59,700
- Night time is possum time. 
- Yeah, we own the night baby.

356
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:14,800
Good night, Rudy.

357
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,500
Wait, wait. What about me?

358
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:49,600
Sleep well, kids. We have a busy 
day tomorrow. Forging, Hunting...

359
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:55,100
Missing my friends. 
Probably are not missing me.

360
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,500
What..?

361
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,400
Your a real softie.
You know that?

362
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:35,000
Manny?

363
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:42,200
Crash? Eddie?

364
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,300
Manny?

365
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,500
What's going on? Are you okay?

366
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,700
I'm sorry. I just wanted 
to keep you safe, and

367
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:15,000
now you're in the most 
dangerous place in the world.

368
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,000
This isn't your fault. It's bigger than 
both of us. We have to get, Sid.

369
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:26,300
Yeah, but If I had been a better friend
to him... we wouldn't be here.

370
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:33,600
Better friend? are you plucking my whiskers? You risked 
your life, your mate and your baby to save your buddy!

371
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:38,200
Not the best husband or father,
but... a damn good friend.

372
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,300
Everybody stop!

373
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:58,600
I smell something.

374
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:05,400
It smells like a buzzard's 
butt fell off. And then 

375
00:56:05,999 --> 00:56:08,300
- got sprayed on by a bunch of, skunks.
- That's, Sid.

376
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,200
Mammal's, we have ourselves a crime scene.

377
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:19,100
Half eaten carcass! hunk of...oh, no! 

378
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,500
Broccoli!

379
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:27,100
Here's what I think happened: Dinosaur attacked Sid,
Sid, fights back with piece of broccoli.

380
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:34,800
- Leaving dinosaur, a vegetable.
- Are you nuts? Sid's not violent. Or co-ordinated.

381
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:38,500
- Yeah and where's the dinosaur?
- Alright, alright. Good point.

382
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,500
Theory two:

383
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:45,000
Sid's eating broccoli. Dinosaur eats
Sid. Dinosaur steps on broccoli. 

384
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,600
- Leaving broccoli, a vegetable.
- Look, when exactly did you lose your mind?

385
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:54,200
Three months ago. I woke up
one morning married to a pineapple.

386
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,200
An ugly pineapple.

387
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:03,000
- But I loved her.
- Uh, Buck! I think you missed a little clue over here.

388
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:11,600
Your friend might be alive.
But not for long. Rudy's closing in.

389
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:18,100
You got it. The plates of, wow.
Or whatever's left of them.

390
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:29,000
Single file everyone. 
Head for, Lava Falls.

391
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:45,000
- What's that sound?
- It's the wind. It's speaking to us.

392
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,600
- What's it saying?
- I don't know. I don't speak wind.

393
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:02,600
- Ellie?
- I'm fine, don't worry about me. I'm just taking my...

394
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,200
Ellie! Whoa!

395
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:13,100
- Manny!
- Get to the ledge!

396
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:31,700
- Ellie!
- Ellie, where are you?

397
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:38,700
- It's okay, I'm up here. 
- Hang on, Ellie. We'll be right there.

398
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:01,400
Wait! Sloth down!

399
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:10,900
Wait... Time out. Hold up.
Jeez, you guys are getting fast.

400
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:18,500
It's not so bad down here.
Nice weather, friendly neighbours.

401
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,100
Hi, neighbour.

402
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:32,200
- Rudy...
- Rudy!

403
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:36,300
- Never heard that kind of dino, before.
- That's, Sid. - We'll have to move fast.

404
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:41,700
- Manny. Pineapples. 
- Pineapples. - She gets cravings.

405
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:46,200
- Pomegranates, grapefruits, nectarines.
- She's ordering a fruit cocktail.

406
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:54,200
- Come on, think. Peaches!
- Peaches...? Peaches!

407
01:00:54,200 --> 01:01:01,200
- The baby! What, what, what now...!
- This not good. - The babies coming.

408
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:06,900
- Can you try to hold it in!
- Can somebody slap him for me? 

409
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:10,200
- Just sit tight, we're coming!
- There's only one thing to do.

410
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:14,100
Possums, your with me. Manny you 
take care of, Ellie until we get back.

411
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:17,800
What? No you can't leave now. 
She's off the trail. What about rule number 2?

412
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:21,200
Rule number 5 says, you can ignore 
rule number 2, if there's a female involved.

413
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:27,200
- Or possibly a cute dog. I just make up these rules as I go along.
- Yeah, but, but, but... she's... you have to.

414
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:35,200
- Manny, it's alright. I got your back.
- Now your talking. Come on, lads.

415
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:42,500
- Take care of our sister. Mr.
- No pressure.

416
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:45,100
What does that mean, "I've got your back?".
I'd rather they cover the front. 

417
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:49,300
- That's where al the good stuff is. 
- We gotta move.

418
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,900
Okay! Alright. It's okay. 
Daddy's, daddy's coming.

419
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,700
I gotta say sweet heart, 
you really got timing...

420
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:26,400
Go away! Go away! Shoo!
Afraid of danger! Afraid of danger!

421
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:41,500
Don't worry, it's just lava. Deadly,

422
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:44,600
violent lava!

423
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,000
- Boys! Are you ready for adventure?
- Yes, sir!

424
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:08,900
- For danger? - Yes, sir! - For death!
- Er, can you repeat the question?

425
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,500
That's right, come on!

426
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:28,700
- Have you ever flown one of these before?
- No, first time actually.

427
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:39,300
- There she is.
- Ellie! - Manny!

428
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:48,100
- I need to get to her.
- Listen, I'l protect, Ellie. You stop those guys.

429
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:53,300
Manny, if they reach her, it'll 
be to late. You have to trust me.

430
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,400
Alright, let's do it.

431
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:37,000
My paws are burning baby. They 
burning, I gotta, tip-toe. Tip-toe, Tip-toe.

432
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:43,800
- Excuse me, twinkle toes. Giving birth here.
- Oh right, sorry. You okay.

433
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:50,200
- Am I okay? Do you know anything about, child birth?
- No, not really, but Manny's coming..

434
01:04:56,500 --> 01:05:02,400
- Deigo, I'm scared? Can I hold your paw.
- Yeah, of course...

435
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:07,400
Just go with the pain.
It's just a contraction.

436
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:24,700
- Look! He's right there. - Roger.
- No, Sid. - I know, Roger!

437
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:30,700
How bout we get, Sid first. And then 
go back for, Roger. - Oh, never mind.

438
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:43,000
Oh, Buck.

439
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:03,100
- Wait! Wait, Sid's that way!
- Tell that to them.

440
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:06,700
Bring it on, you chicken headed freaks!

441
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,300
Don't worry about a thing.
You're doing fine.

442
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:32,900
It's going great.
Ah, excuse me.

443
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:38,000
- Just keep breathing.
- Diego!

444
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,200
Just breathe, that's the important thing.

445
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,800
Grab that ammo.

446
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:56,600
- Bogey at 3'o clock.
- Fire!

447
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:08,100
This is awesome!

448
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,300
Light it up!

449
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:15,100
- Yeah!
- Hasta la vista, birdie.

450
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:29,000
Let's get our...

451
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:36,000
Mayday! Mayday! We're 
losing altitude! Hold these.

452
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:43,200
- That tastes like fish.
- Okay. That's just weird.

453
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:46,000
- I love you, bro!
- I know!

454
01:07:46,500 --> 01:08:03,200
- Snap out of it, come on! Pull!
- This is the end of, Sid the sloth.

455
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:14,100
- Help!
- No, Sid. It's me. - And me!

456
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:18,100
I don't want to panic anybody, 
but who's flying this thing?

457
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:33,000
No, no, wait, my kids!

458
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:39,000
I never even got to say goodbye.

459
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:47,500
- You can do it. Push! Push! - I can't do it.
- Just one more big push.

460
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:53,900
You have no idea what I'm going through.
Okay forget I said that. Let's do this together.

461
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:12,200
- I liked you guys better, when you were extinct.
- Oh, I'm getting dizzy.

462
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:18,300
Manny. Come on buddy.
I think we're getting close.

463
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:58,500
She's perfect.
I think we should call her, Ellie.

464
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:04,600
- Little, Ellie...
- I've got a better name... Peaches. - Peaches?

465
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:11,400
Why not? She's sweet, and round,
and covered with furs.

466
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:14,500
I love it.

467
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:20,000
- I saw that, tuff guy.
- No, no, that last dino caught my eye with a claw and...

468
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:27,100
- Alright, so I'm not made of stone.
- Incoming!

469
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:29,100
It's Sid!

470
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:37,500
- Oh, It's a boy!
- That's it's tail. - It's a girl.

471
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:45,100
Hi, sweetheart. It's uncle, Sid.
Oh you're so beautiful.

472
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:48,900
She looks just like her mother.
Thank goodness.

473
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:54,200
Oh, no offence, Manny. You're beautiful on 
the inside. - It's good to have you back, Sid.

474
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:59,200
I never thought I would say
this, but... I missed you buddy.

475
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:07,700
Now I wish my kids were here.
You could have been friends.

476
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:09,800
Ellie!

477
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:17,900
- I promised myself I wouldn't cry.
- I didn't.

478
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:27,500
I forgot what it was like to be part of a family.
What about you? ever thought about having kids?

479
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:34,500
Alright, mammal's. Let's get you home.

480
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:01,700
This is it, mammal's. Right where 
you started. This was fun.

481
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:04,900
- We could make it a regular thing.
- I don't know about that.

482
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:11,000
Right, Right. Yes cos' of all 
the uh, mortal peril. Of-course.

483
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:15,500
- Oh, well, the Buck stops here.
- We couldn't have done it without you.

484
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,300
Well obviously. But, good times just the same...

485
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:23,900
We're not alone, are we?

486
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:29,200
Hello, Rudy.

487
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:39,300
Run!

488
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:49,700
Over here you colossal, fossil!
Looking for something?

489
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:56,500
Why don't you come and 
get it? To the cave! Go!

490
01:13:57,700 --> 01:14:02,000
- Stay with the baby.
- We'll be fine. Go!

491
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:09,900
Wuss!

492
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:23,200
Pop, Goes the weasel!

493
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:37,200
Shoo, shoo! Come on! Move!

494
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:41,400
Diego... Catch!

495
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:56,100
Through the hole, over the 
valley. One more loop. - Come on lads, heev!

496
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:14,500
Better luck next time, snowflake. This isn't
Gonna hold him long. Let's go.

497
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:17,100
Hold up, guys!

498
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:40,400
Way to go, mom-zilla!

499
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:15,000
Come here, kids. well let me tell you something. 
You're where you belong now.

500
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:20,200
And I'm sure you're gonna grow 
up to be giant, horrifying dinosaurs.

501
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,600
Just like your mother.

502
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,600
Momma...

503
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:30,100
...take good care of our kids.

504
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:59,600
- You were a good parent, Sid.
- Thank's.

505
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,100
- Can I baby-sit for you.
- Not a chance.

506
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:05,200
- Oh come on, I work cheap.
- Alright, I'll think about it. 

507
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:09,500
- Yes! 
- Never happened. 

508
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:17,000
- He's gone. What am I supposed to do now?
- That's easy.

509
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:22,600
- Come with us.
- You mean... up there?

510
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:28,700
I never thought of going back. I've 
been down here so long, it feels like up to me.

511
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:36,500
- I'm not sure I can fit-in up there anymore.
- So look at us. We look like a normal herd to you?

512
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:38,600
Ouch!

513
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:05,100
So long, big guy.

514
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,800
That's our queue. Come on peaches.

515
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,300
He's alive.

516
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,400
Buck...?

517
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:28,500
- I... I gotta...
- Yeah...

518
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:33,800
Besides this world should 
really stay down here.

519
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:39,100
- Take care of 'em, tiger.
- "Always listen to, Buck."

520
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:41,500
We're almost out.

521
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:14,400
- Is everybody, okay?
- Where's Buck?

522
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:20,000
Don't worry.
He's where he wants to be.

523
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,300
- Is he going to be okay?
- Are you kidding? Nothing can kill that weasel.

524
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:27,500
It's, Rudy I'm worried about.

525
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:43,800
I know this baby thing isn't for you.
But whatever you decide to do...

526
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:48,300
I'm not leaving, buddy.
Life of adventure... It's right here.

527
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:54,100
Well, I got a whole speech here. I've been 
working on it. how can I show you that I'm strong and...

528
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:57,900
sensitive? Noble, yet caring?

529
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:00,800
Thank's.

530
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,900
Ah, they grow so fast, huh? 
Look at my kids.

531
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:25,100
- Seems they were born one day and then gone the next.
- They were, Sid. - Yeah, it was alot of work.

532
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,400
It's right, sweetheart.
Welcome to the Ice Age.

533
