1
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:22,673
Now, children,
are you sitting comfortably?

2
00:00:23,549 --> 00:00:24,633
Then I'll begin.

3
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,763
This story started many
thousands of years ago,

4
00:00:30,139 --> 00:00:32,683
but it was all over
in just seven days.

5
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,061
All that long, long time ago,
none of the things we can see now...

6
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:42,233
the sun, the moon, the stars,
the earth, the animals and plants...

7
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,402
not a single one existed.

8
00:00:44,652 --> 00:00:48,823
Only God existed, and so
only He could have created them.

9
00:00:49,323 --> 00:00:50,491
And He did.

10
00:03:00,451 --> 00:03:04,871
Mr. Simpson. What a character!
I wonder whatever became of him?

11
00:03:05,872 --> 00:03:08,207
Oh, I imagine he's dead,
like all the rest.

12
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,668
Ah, those were the days.

13
00:03:20,344 --> 00:03:22,388
Mr. Tuttle, your hair!

14
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:31,230
Yes?

15
00:03:31,731 --> 00:03:34,524
Good morning, ma'am.
We've come about the...

16
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:36,651
Oh yes, of course.

17
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:39,446
Come in.

18
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,117
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

19
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:52,375
You are?

20
00:03:52,918 --> 00:03:56,713
I'm Bertha Mills, ma'am.
And this is Edmund Tuttle.

21
00:03:56,922 --> 00:03:58,381
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

22
00:03:58,632 --> 00:03:59,925
You must be the gardener.

23
00:04:00,717 --> 00:04:02,301
Ay, that's right, the gardener.

24
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:05,930
And this young lady's called Lydia.

25
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:09,100
Have you had
much experience in service?

26
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,146
Oh, don't let that angel face fool
you. She's older than she looks.

27
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:15,898
Can you iron?

28
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,569
What's the matter?
Has the cat got your tongue?

29
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:24,448
Ah, she can't talk, ma'am.

30
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,617
The poor little mite's a mute.

31
00:04:28,327 --> 00:04:29,245
Oh, but she's a good little

32
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:30,955
worker, I can promise you that.

33
00:04:32,247 --> 00:04:34,541
All right. All right.

34
00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:37,335
The other girl I had spoke
too much anyway. Follow me.

35
00:04:37,794 --> 00:04:41,381
You and the girl will sleep in the
attic room at the top of the stairs.

36
00:04:42,257 --> 00:04:45,176
- And you, Mr...
- Tuttle, ma'am.

37
00:04:45,427 --> 00:04:48,930
Ah, Tuttle. Ah, you can sleep
in the shed, around the back.

38
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:52,350
As you can see,
the housework has been rather

39
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,645
neglected since the servants
disappeared, almost a week ago.

40
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:57,897
You mean they just vanished?

41
00:04:58,356 --> 00:05:00,608
Into thin air.
No notice, nothing.

42
00:05:01,443 --> 00:05:05,446
They didn't even collect their
wages. They... they just left us.

43
00:05:05,988 --> 00:05:07,823
What a strange thing to do!

44
00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:12,745
There are times when this house
is not exactly an ideal home.

45
00:05:13,996 --> 00:05:18,751
Hence my advertisement in the paper
for honest, hardworking people.

46
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:23,213
There's nobody more honest or
hardworking that us, eh, Mr. Tuttle?

47
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:24,631
Oh, ay, we're very honest.

48
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:28,469
And uhm... very hardworking.

49
00:05:31,804 --> 00:05:32,889
The kitchen.

50
00:05:34,015 --> 00:05:37,810
I have breakfast at eight,
the children at nine,

51
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:40,897
lunch will be served at one
and dinner at half past seven.

52
00:05:41,105 --> 00:05:41,981
And the master, ma'am?

53
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:50,031
The master went off to war
a year and a half ago.

54
00:05:51,157 --> 00:05:53,743
I've had no news
since the war ended.

55
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,828
Which of you does the cooking?

56
00:05:56,454 --> 00:05:57,789
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

57
00:05:58,623 --> 00:05:59,916
Which of you does the cooking?

58
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,250
You all notice what I'm doing?

59
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,211
In this house,

60
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,173
no door must be opened without
the previous one being closed first.

61
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,467
It is vital
that you remember this.

62
00:06:11,218 --> 00:06:14,346
It is not as easy as it may seem.
There are fifteen different keys

63
00:06:14,554 --> 00:06:18,558
for all of the fifty doors,
depending on the area of the house.

64
00:06:19,893 --> 00:06:24,314
Mrs. Mills, from tomorrow I'll
be leaving a set in your charge.

65
00:06:25,273 --> 00:06:26,108
Yes, ma'am.

66
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:28,151
The music room.

67
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,529
That old piano was already here
when we moved in. Please do not

68
00:06:31,737 --> 00:06:33,781
let the children
thump away on it.

69
00:06:34,907 --> 00:06:36,450
It sets off my migraine.

70
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:40,496
Silence is something that
we prize very highly in this house.

71
00:06:41,414 --> 00:06:43,082
That is why
you will not find a telephone,

72
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,960
a radio or anything else
that makes a racket.

73
00:06:47,086 --> 00:06:48,421
Ah... we don't have
electricity either.

74
00:06:49,004 --> 00:06:52,716
The Germans kept cutting it off, so
we just learned to live without it.

75
00:06:52,883 --> 00:06:54,009
- Let's continue.
- Ma'am,

76
00:06:54,218 --> 00:06:56,220
there's really no need to show us
around the whole house, we...

77
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:57,346
Yes!

78
00:06:58,264 --> 00:06:59,432
Yes, there is.

79
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:03,143
Because here, most of the time,
you can hardly see your way.

80
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:05,103
It's often difficult
to make out if there is a table,

81
00:07:05,311 --> 00:07:07,772
a chair, a door, a sideboard...

82
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,943
or one of my children
playing hide-and-seek.

83
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:14,279
What do you mean, ma'am?

84
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:18,575
Perhaps I should introduce
you to the children.

85
00:07:24,873 --> 00:07:28,084
Mr. Tuttle, see to the garden now.
You'll find tools in the shed.

86
00:07:28,293 --> 00:07:29,294
Yes, ma'am.

87
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,795
You two can start
closing the curtains.

88
00:07:32,796 --> 00:07:33,756
All of them.

89
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,119
Come.

90
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:18,633
I'll wake them.
You wait here.

91
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:22,136
Whatever you do,
don't open the curtains.

92
00:08:25,807 --> 00:08:27,016
Wakey-wakey.

93
00:08:30,602 --> 00:08:34,815
Now, come on,
eyes closed, hands together.

94
00:08:36,358 --> 00:08:40,278
Blessed be, at light of day,
Jesus, to whom now I pray.

95
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:45,200
Blessed be the Virgin pure
whom I greet with faith so sure.

96
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:50,330
Jesus, Mary, Spotless Rose,
keep us till this day doth close.

97
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,506
- They're still half-asleep.
- What sweet little

98
00:08:59,714 --> 00:09:00,881
children!

99
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:04,969
Well? What do you say?

100
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,012
How do you do?

101
00:09:08,222 --> 00:09:09,014
How do you do?

102
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,226
How do you, children?

103
00:09:12,893 --> 00:09:16,397
My name's Mrs. Mills,
but you can call me Bertha

104
00:09:16,605 --> 00:09:19,233
if you like.
What are your names?

105
00:09:19,942 --> 00:09:20,818
Anne.

106
00:09:20,985 --> 00:09:22,153
Nicholas.

107
00:09:22,403 --> 00:09:25,573
Anne and Nicholas.
What pretty names!

108
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:28,909
Are you going
to be our new nanny?

109
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:35,999
Yes, my dears,
I'm your new nanny.

110
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,501
It's time for their breakfast.
Lydia, go

111
00:09:38,793 --> 00:09:40,587
to the kitchen
and close every shutter.

112
00:09:47,635 --> 00:09:50,138
The doctors were never
able to find a cure.

113
00:09:50,305 --> 00:09:51,264
For what?

114
00:09:52,348 --> 00:09:53,433
Their condition.

115
00:09:55,101 --> 00:09:57,937
The children have
a very serious allergy to light.

116
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,899
They are photosensitive and they
must never be exposed to any light

117
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:03,400
much stronger than this.

118
00:10:04,401 --> 00:10:08,322
Otherwise in minutes they would
break out in sores and blisters

119
00:10:09,364 --> 00:10:12,618
and begin to suffocate.
It would eventually be fatal.

120
00:10:12,826 --> 00:10:13,911
Good heavens!

121
00:10:16,455 --> 00:10:19,500
- I don't like this toast.
- Oh, why not?

122
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:23,379
It tastes funny.
I liked it better before.

123
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:27,424
Well, that's because,
before, somebody else made it.

124
00:10:28,675 --> 00:10:30,259
When are they coming back?

125
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:33,846
They're not coming back, child.

126
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:36,307
Just like daddy.

127
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:39,352
Daddy is coming back, though.

128
00:10:40,228 --> 00:10:43,564
Mrs. Mills, our father is fighting
in a war in France, you know.

129
00:10:43,773 --> 00:10:44,982
It's the World War.

130
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:46,859
I know, but he's in France.

131
00:10:47,068 --> 00:10:50,154
That's enough, chatterboxes.
Finish up your breakfasts.

132
00:10:51,823 --> 00:10:53,324
Are you going to leave us too?

133
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,036
Of course not.

134
00:10:58,454 --> 00:10:59,913
Why should I leave you?

135
00:11:00,414 --> 00:11:04,167
The others said they wouldn't
but they did. And then it happened.

136
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:06,169
Be quiet!

137
00:11:08,463 --> 00:11:10,716
What do you mean, Anne?
What happened?

138
00:11:13,969 --> 00:11:15,429
Mummy went...

139
00:11:16,221 --> 00:11:17,139
mad.

140
00:11:17,347 --> 00:11:19,766
- Nothing happened.
- Yes, it did.

141
00:11:19,975 --> 00:11:20,684
No, it didn't!

142
00:11:20,892 --> 00:11:21,727
Yes, it did!

143
00:11:21,935 --> 00:11:22,894
Be quiet!

144
00:11:25,939 --> 00:11:27,441
What's going on?

145
00:11:28,024 --> 00:11:28,816
I want to see those plates

146
00:11:29,024 --> 00:11:31,318
empty in less than a minute.
Is that clear?

147
00:11:34,947 --> 00:11:36,741
Mrs. Mills, would you
come outside a moment?

148
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:38,743
I'd like a word with you.

149
00:11:40,995 --> 00:11:42,079
Yes, ma'am.

150
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:48,836
The postman usually
comes every Wednesday,

151
00:11:50,296 --> 00:11:53,049
but I've just checked the letter box
and this week he hasn't.

152
00:11:54,675 --> 00:11:55,760
I'm afraid I don't follow, ma'am.

153
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,386
This letter should have been
collected and delivered

154
00:11:58,595 --> 00:12:00,388
to the newspaper five days ago.

155
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:02,682
It's an advertisement for servants.
Since it was never

156
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:04,893
published, would you mind
explaining to me what you're

157
00:12:05,101 --> 00:12:06,603
doing here?

158
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,146
Now I understand.

159
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:12,067
Well, ma'am, that's exactly what
I was going to say to you when you

160
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:13,526
opened the door to us.

161
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,278
The truth is that

162
00:12:15,528 --> 00:12:17,822
we just come by
on the off-chance.

163
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:22,160
A big house like this is always in
need of someone who knows the ropes.

164
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:25,413
You mean you've served
in a house like this one before?

165
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:28,332
This may come as a surprise
to you, ma'am, but...

166
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:32,044
We, in fact,
used to work here.

167
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,463
Here?

168
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,758
Oh, now, it was a few years ago.

169
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,720
And if you don't mind
my saying so, ma'am,

170
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:44,890
they were the best years
of my life.

171
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:48,477
That's why we come by,
because this house

172
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,938
means a lot to us.

173
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,483
Perhaps I'd best show you
our references, ma'am.

174
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,944
No, no, no.
Don't bother, there's no need.

175
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:59,195
Ah, so you say
you know the house well?

176
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,864
Like the back of my hand.

177
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:05,284
Well, that is always assuming that
the walls haven't sprouted legs

178
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,328
and moved in the meantime.

179
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,622
The only thing that
moves here is the light.

180
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,961
But it changes everything.

181
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,218
It's rather difficult,
to say the least.

182
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,138
One might almost say...

183
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,514
unbearable.

184
00:13:30,225 --> 00:13:33,145
The only way of enduring it
is by keeping a cool head.

185
00:13:34,354 --> 00:13:35,772
Oh, yes, ma'am.

186
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,066
I don't like fantasies.

187
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,569
Strange ideas,
do you know what I mean?

188
00:13:41,945 --> 00:13:44,114
I think so, ma'am.

189
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,533
My children sometimes
have strange ideas.

190
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,871
But you mustn't pay
any attention to them.

191
00:13:51,955 --> 00:13:53,540
Children will be children.

192
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,334
Yes, of course, ma'am.

193
00:13:57,168 --> 00:13:58,377
All right,

194
00:14:00,463 --> 00:14:01,672
you can stay.

195
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,051
Thank you very much, ma'am.

196
00:14:17,313 --> 00:14:19,065
It did happen.

197
00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:33,078
"The Roman governor tried to make
them change their minds afterwards."

198
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,747
"To make them change
their minds," full stop.

199
00:14:36,664 --> 00:14:37,999
- "Afterwards...
- "Afterwards."

200
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,126
"...he ordered them to be beaten.

201
00:14:40,335 --> 00:14:42,379
But Justus and Pastor,

202
00:14:42,587 --> 00:14:44,214
far from being afraid,

203
00:14:44,381 --> 00:14:45,632
rejoiced and showed
themselves willing

204
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,592
to die for Christ.
When he

205
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:50,387
saw this, the Roman governor
was filled with rage

206
00:14:50,595 --> 00:14:52,055
and ordered their heads
to be cut off."

207
00:14:57,643 --> 00:14:59,103
What do you find so amusing?

208
00:15:01,688 --> 00:15:02,648
Well...

209
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,317
- Well, what?
- Those children

210
00:15:05,526 --> 00:15:07,069
were really stupid.

211
00:15:08,153 --> 00:15:09,279
- Why?
- Because

212
00:15:09,488 --> 00:15:13,033
they said they only believed in
Jesus and then got killed for it.

213
00:15:13,492 --> 00:15:14,576
And what would you

214
00:15:14,827 --> 00:15:17,287
- have done, deny Christ?
- Well, yes.

215
00:15:18,038 --> 00:15:19,873
Inside, I would have
believed in him.

216
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:22,251
But I wouldn't have told
the Romans that.

217
00:15:25,337 --> 00:15:27,130
Is that what
you think too, Nicholas?

218
00:15:31,217 --> 00:15:32,510
I see.

219
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:37,014
So you both would have lied
to the point of denying Christ.

220
00:15:37,265 --> 00:15:40,476
Oh, you'd have saved your heads
being chopped off by the Romans...

221
00:15:41,561 --> 00:15:44,397
- But what would have happened after?
- When?

222
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:46,607
In the next life,

223
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,901
the one that's waiting
for us after

224
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,737
we die?
Where would you have gone?

225
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,614
Where, Nicholas?

226
00:15:53,823 --> 00:15:56,199
- To the children's Limbo.
- What is

227
00:15:56,366 --> 00:15:58,744
- the children's Limbo, Anne?
- One of the four Hells.

228
00:15:59,453 --> 00:16:00,245
Which are?

229
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:05,042
Me, me, me, me,

230
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:05,917
me, me!

231
00:16:06,126 --> 00:16:08,295
No, no, no,
let him answer. Which are?

232
00:16:09,046 --> 00:16:11,381
There's the hell
where the damned go,

233
00:16:12,174 --> 00:16:13,341
then there's Purgatory...

234
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:15,927
- Yes?
- And the Bosom of Abraham,

235
00:16:16,178 --> 00:16:18,263
where the Just go,
and Limbo, where children go.

236
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,723
At the centre of the Earth.

237
00:16:20,057 --> 00:16:21,641
Where it's very, very hot.

238
00:16:22,893 --> 00:16:26,270
That's where children go who tell
lies, but not just for a few days.

239
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:29,899
Oh, no.
No, they're damned.

240
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:31,650
Forever.

241
00:16:32,443 --> 00:16:33,903
Think about it.

242
00:16:35,571 --> 00:16:36,864
Try to imagine

243
00:16:38,157 --> 00:16:39,825
the end of eternity.

244
00:16:40,368 --> 00:16:41,369
Close your eyes.

245
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:44,372
Close your eyes
and try to imagine it.

246
00:16:46,207 --> 00:16:47,041
Forever.

247
00:16:49,543 --> 00:16:50,503
Pain.

248
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:52,630
Forever.

249
00:16:54,256 --> 00:16:55,673
I'm getting dizzy.

250
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:00,178
Now do you understand
why Justus and Pastor

251
00:17:00,345 --> 00:17:01,513
told the truth?

252
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,018
Right.

253
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:10,939
Ah, open your readers
at Lesson 6.

254
00:17:11,147 --> 00:17:13,483
- Can we go and play?
- You most certainly cannot.

255
00:17:13,691 --> 00:17:17,153
First, you're going to read the
lesson and then learn it by heart.

256
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:18,738
All of it?

257
00:17:18,988 --> 00:17:22,117
Anne, any more protests and there'll
be no playing for you at all today.

258
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:23,493
In fact...

259
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:26,453
I think you can study
in separate rooms.

260
00:17:26,662 --> 00:17:29,081
- No, no, no!
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

261
00:17:29,331 --> 00:17:32,126
- We get scared if we're separated.
- You get scared?

262
00:17:32,376 --> 00:17:34,086
As if you weren't used
to this house by now.

263
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:35,963
What if we see a ghost?

264
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:39,174
Has your sister been
telling you one of her stories?

265
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,884
I haven't told him anything.

266
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,970
Well, if you see a ghost,
you say hello and you continue

267
00:17:43,178 --> 00:17:44,930
on studying. Anne, come
with me to the music room.

268
00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:46,140
Why me?

269
00:17:46,348 --> 00:17:48,058
Because I say so!
Now come on,

270
00:17:48,726 --> 00:17:49,810
take your book.

271
00:17:50,394 --> 00:17:53,397
Nicholas, I want to see that lesson
learned in less than an hour.

272
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,773
- Mummy...
- What?

273
00:17:56,983 --> 00:17:58,067
Give me a kiss.

274
00:17:58,276 --> 00:18:01,029
"Give me a kiss,
give me a kiss..."

275
00:18:01,237 --> 00:18:02,989
Anne, wait for me outside.

276
00:18:03,489 --> 00:18:04,615
You know I can't.

277
00:18:07,368 --> 00:18:08,327
Over there.

278
00:18:11,247 --> 00:18:12,081
Mrs. Mills,

279
00:18:12,248 --> 00:18:17,045
close all the curtains. My daughter
is going to cross the living room.

280
00:18:17,628 --> 00:18:18,671
Yes, ma'am.

281
00:18:26,511 --> 00:18:27,512
All right, Anne.

282
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:31,767
Darling...

283
00:18:33,977 --> 00:18:36,229
mummy can't be
with you all the time.

284
00:18:39,024 --> 00:18:41,109
You must learn
to be on your own.

285
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,155
Where's your rosary?

286
00:18:49,493 --> 00:18:51,328
Whenever you feel afraid,

287
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:56,207
I want you to squeeze it with all
your might and say an Our Father,

288
00:18:56,415 --> 00:18:58,459
and then your fear will go away.

289
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:01,837
- It won't.
- Yes, yes, it will. Honestly.

290
00:19:03,756 --> 00:19:06,258
Don't you see that when
you do this, the Lord is with you?

291
00:19:08,177 --> 00:19:10,137
There's no reason to be afraid.

292
00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:51,720
"The house and the family.

293
00:19:52,637 --> 00:19:55,180
We all live in
a house with our family.

294
00:19:55,848 --> 00:19:58,684
The family is usually
made up of parents,

295
00:19:58,934 --> 00:20:01,395
children and their grandparents.

296
00:20:01,562 --> 00:20:03,230
We must be obedient..."

297
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:06,650
"...and kind towards
the other members of our family

298
00:20:07,026 --> 00:20:11,071
and we must never argue or fight
with our brothers and sisters..."

299
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,991
Do you have any children?

300
00:20:14,158 --> 00:20:14,783
No.

301
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:16,285
Mr. Tuttle

302
00:20:16,493 --> 00:20:19,246
and the girl, Lydia,
are all I've got.

303
00:20:19,455 --> 00:20:22,916
- And I'm all they've got.
- Was she born like that?

304
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,751
Beg your pardon, ma'am?

305
00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:26,836
The girl.

306
00:20:27,587 --> 00:20:28,755
Was she born a mute?

307
00:20:29,881 --> 00:20:30,757
No.

308
00:20:32,842 --> 00:20:36,387
You know, I think I've finished
here, ma'am. If you'll excuse me,

309
00:20:36,596 --> 00:20:39,515
I think I'll go and see
if Mr. Tuttle needs a hand.

310
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:10,921
Nicholas!

311
00:21:16,385 --> 00:21:17,636
Nicholas, I'm coming!

312
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:27,144
- Nicholas?
- What's the matter?

313
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:30,356
- Why were you crying?
- I wasn't crying. I was reading.

314
00:21:31,315 --> 00:21:32,858
But I just heard you...

315
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:35,277
Anne!

316
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,202
Anne!

317
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:46,622
Anne?

318
00:21:47,331 --> 00:21:49,458
I haven't learned it yet, mummy.

319
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,585
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

320
00:21:53,086 --> 00:21:55,463
- Why were you crying?
- I wasn't crying.

321
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,133
But I just heard you
a moment ago.

322
00:22:00,093 --> 00:22:01,761
There's no need
to feel ashamed, darling.

323
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:05,557
I don't.
If I'd been crying, I'd tell you.

324
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:06,891
Oh, really?
So I imagined it, did I?

325
00:22:07,976 --> 00:22:09,686
No. It was that boy.

326
00:22:10,812 --> 00:22:11,688
What boy?

327
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:13,565
Victor.

328
00:22:15,025 --> 00:22:15,900
Who's Victor?

329
00:22:17,152 --> 00:22:18,570
The boy who was
here a moment ago.

330
00:22:19,612 --> 00:22:22,698
I told him to let me study,
but he wouldn't stop crying.

331
00:22:23,657 --> 00:22:25,451
I think he's a spoilt brat.

332
00:22:25,784 --> 00:22:27,911
He said we had
to leave the house.

333
00:22:28,662 --> 00:22:29,496
Did he now?

334
00:22:30,414 --> 00:22:31,665
Why was he crying?

335
00:22:31,874 --> 00:22:34,960
Because he doesn't like
this house but he has to live here.

336
00:22:35,169 --> 00:22:36,336
His father's a pianist and...

337
00:22:36,545 --> 00:22:38,881
- Oh, his father's a pianist, is he?
- Yes.

338
00:22:39,381 --> 00:22:42,843
And I've told him he's not allowed
to touch the piano. He isn't, is he?

339
00:22:45,054 --> 00:22:47,014
So, you've spoken
to his father as well?

340
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:50,976
No, only with Victor. His father
is with the others in the hall.

341
00:22:51,185 --> 00:22:53,227
But I've just come from the hall,
and there's no one there.

342
00:22:55,146 --> 00:22:57,982
They must have gone upstairs.
They're viewing the house.

343
00:22:58,232 --> 00:23:00,151
That'll do, Anne.
That's enough.

344
00:23:02,236 --> 00:23:03,154
Now, why were you crying?

345
00:23:03,363 --> 00:23:05,490
- It was Victor!
- So where is he now?

346
00:23:05,698 --> 00:23:07,116
- He went out through there.
- Would you

347
00:23:07,367 --> 00:23:11,079
mind telling me how a boy can get in
and out of this room if it's locked?

348
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:18,127
I thought I made
myself quite clear!

349
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:22,714
No door is to be opened without the
previous one being closed first.

350
00:23:22,881 --> 00:23:24,674
Is that so hard to understand?

351
00:23:25,467 --> 00:23:26,802
This house is like a ship.

352
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,012
The light must be contained
as if it were water,

353
00:23:29,262 --> 00:23:31,348
by opening and closing the doors.

354
00:23:32,516 --> 00:23:34,768
- My children's lives are at stake!
- But, ma'am, I...

355
00:23:35,185 --> 00:23:36,895
Do not argue with me!
Be quiet!

356
00:23:38,146 --> 00:23:40,107
Now which was the last
of you to enter that room?

357
00:23:41,358 --> 00:23:42,275
Lydia?

358
00:23:45,153 --> 00:23:47,155
She hasn't got a key,
I already told you that.

359
00:23:47,781 --> 00:23:49,783
- Well, that leaves you, then.
- But I was

360
00:23:50,033 --> 00:23:52,493
in the hall the whole time.
And then I went out into the garden.

361
00:23:52,743 --> 00:23:53,744
You saw me with your own eyes.

362
00:23:54,036 --> 00:23:56,205
I hope you are not
suggesting that it was me!

363
00:23:57,832 --> 00:23:59,500
Do you think that I would
overlook such a thing

364
00:23:59,709 --> 00:24:01,585
and endanger the life
of my own daughter?

365
00:24:09,385 --> 00:24:11,637
You're not supposed
to read at the table.

366
00:24:12,722 --> 00:24:15,391
Oh, really?
Well, who is going to tell mummy?

367
00:24:15,808 --> 00:24:16,684
You?

368
00:24:19,729 --> 00:24:21,313
Or perhaps... you?

369
00:24:27,318 --> 00:24:28,278
Did you really see

370
00:24:28,486 --> 00:24:29,571
a boy?

371
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,073
Yes, he's called Victor.

372
00:24:34,826 --> 00:24:37,287
- Is he a ghost?
- Don't be stupid.

373
00:24:37,495 --> 00:24:38,747
Ghosts aren't like that.

374
00:24:39,205 --> 00:24:40,749
What are they like?

375
00:24:41,249 --> 00:24:45,253
I've told you a thousand times.
They go about in white sheets

376
00:24:45,462 --> 00:24:47,297
- and carry chains.
- How do you know?

377
00:24:47,505 --> 00:24:50,425
Because I've seen them.
They come out at night.

378
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,385
Fibber! Where?

379
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,853
- You're stupid.
- Not half as much as you.

380
00:25:03,395 --> 00:25:05,105
Well, I don't believe
you saw that boy.

381
00:25:05,689 --> 00:25:08,650
Believe what you like. You'll soon
be begging us to play with you.

382
00:25:22,205 --> 00:25:23,998
Nicholas. Nicholas.

383
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:27,085
What?

384
00:25:27,418 --> 00:25:29,128
Look.

385
00:25:30,213 --> 00:25:32,090
Why have you
opened the curtains?

386
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:34,050
- It wasn't me.
- Who was it then?

387
00:25:34,509 --> 00:25:37,887
It was Victor.
He's been doing it all night.

388
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:42,392
- Liar. I'm going to tell mummy.
- So I'm a liar, am I?

389
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,559
Yes.

390
00:25:44,644 --> 00:25:48,481
Victor, come out behind that curtain
so my stupid brother can see you.

391
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:01,952
- Leave me alone!
- You don't want to see him now, eh?

392
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,372
You're a cowardly custard,
cowardly custard.

393
00:26:05,622 --> 00:26:07,207
Cowardly, cowardly custard.

394
00:26:09,626 --> 00:26:11,795
Well, I'll just have
to do it myself, then.

395
00:26:29,562 --> 00:26:31,022
That's enough, Victor!

396
00:26:34,275 --> 00:26:38,154
Nicholas, tell him to leave
the curtains alone. He won't listen

397
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,948
- to me.
- Get off my bed, both of you!

398
00:26:41,198 --> 00:26:44,452
- This is our bed.
- No, it's mine.

399
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:47,705
Anne, please stop
putting on that voice.

400
00:26:47,913 --> 00:26:49,707
You be quiet,
cowardly custard.

401
00:26:50,915 --> 00:26:55,045
Listen, if you don't stop, I'll call
my mother and she'll kick you out.

402
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,215
- You don't know my mother!
- And you don't know my parents.

403
00:26:59,466 --> 00:27:01,301
Anne, I'm going
to tell mummy about you.

404
00:27:02,635 --> 00:27:04,429
Don't be stupid!
Can't you see it's not me?

405
00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:08,475
Victor, touch his cheek
so he knows you're real.

406
00:27:20,277 --> 00:27:22,237
Help! Mummy! Help!

407
00:27:22,488 --> 00:27:24,281
Help! Mummy!

408
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:25,115
What is it?

409
00:27:25,324 --> 00:27:26,575
- Help!
- What is it?

410
00:27:28,285 --> 00:27:29,870
What? What is it?

411
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,789
She was frightening me

412
00:27:31,997 --> 00:27:33,540
and I told her
to be quiet and...

413
00:27:33,749 --> 00:27:37,002
I'm fed up! Do you hear me?
I am fed up with you!

414
00:27:37,252 --> 00:27:39,421
I didn't do anything!

415
00:27:43,258 --> 00:27:47,763
"Therefore the Lord God sent him
forth from the garden of Eden,

416
00:27:48,263 --> 00:27:50,723
to till the ground
from whence he was taken.

417
00:27:50,932 --> 00:27:55,978
So he drove out the man and placed
at the east of the garden Cherubims

418
00:27:56,187 --> 00:27:58,606
and a flaming sword
which turned every way,

419
00:27:58,856 --> 00:28:00,733
to keep the way
of the tree of life."

420
00:28:01,526 --> 00:28:03,194
There! I've finished.

421
00:28:04,487 --> 00:28:06,114
Very good.

422
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:11,285
Now you can ask
the Virgin for forgiveness.

423
00:28:11,953 --> 00:28:14,664
What!
That's not what we agreed.

424
00:28:14,914 --> 00:28:16,874
We didn't agree
anything, young lady.

425
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:19,710
Today you're being punished
and you'll do as I say.

426
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,795
You can't make me ask
the Virgin for forgiveness.

427
00:28:22,045 --> 00:28:23,213
How dare you?

428
00:28:23,422 --> 00:28:26,466
Mummy, I won't ask for forgiveness
for something I didn't do.

429
00:28:26,675 --> 00:28:28,635
You told your brother that there
was someone else in the room!

430
00:28:28,844 --> 00:28:30,137
- There was!
- You're lying!

431
00:28:30,345 --> 00:28:30,929
I am not!

432
00:28:33,473 --> 00:28:34,391
Anne.

433
00:28:35,517 --> 00:28:38,520
Anne, do you remember
the story about Justus and Pastor?

434
00:28:39,146 --> 00:28:40,605
Children who don't tell the truth

435
00:28:40,814 --> 00:28:41,982
end up in Limbo.

436
00:28:42,649 --> 00:28:43,692
That's what you say.

437
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,696
But I read that Limbo is only for
children who haven't been baptised.

438
00:28:48,655 --> 00:28:50,781
And I have.

439
00:28:52,241 --> 00:28:55,411
"And Abraham took the wood
of the burnt offering

440
00:28:55,661 --> 00:29:00,374
and laid it upon Isaac, his son.
And he took the fire in his hand

441
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:04,462
and the knife, and they went,
both of them together,

442
00:29:04,712 --> 00:29:08,007
and Isaac spake unto Abraham,
his father, and said,

443
00:29:08,215 --> 00:29:12,887
'My father.'And he said,
'Here I am, my son.'And he..."

444
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:30,111
Did you look in on Nicholas?

445
00:29:30,445 --> 00:29:33,990
Yes, ma'am.
The little angel is fast asleep.

446
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:37,369
What about Anne?
Is she still on the stairs?

447
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:39,871
Oh yes, ma'am.

448
00:29:41,748 --> 00:29:42,791
I'd prefer to have her
where I can see her,

449
00:29:42,999 --> 00:29:45,669
but I can't embroider
in such poor light.

450
00:29:49,672 --> 00:29:51,715
How long is this punishment
going to go on? It's been

451
00:29:51,882 --> 00:29:52,883
three days now.

452
00:29:53,634 --> 00:29:54,718
It's up to her.

453
00:29:57,096 --> 00:30:00,099
She's got to learn to swallow
her pride and ask for forgiveness.

454
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:03,811
Anyway, it's about time
she started to read the Bible.

455
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,482
Well, the priest will be
very pleased to hear that, ma'am.

456
00:30:08,691 --> 00:30:10,401
If he ever deigns
to pay us another visit.

457
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:12,945
He knows perfectly well
that the children can't go out.

458
00:30:13,153 --> 00:30:14,446
Oh, he told me
yesterday he'd be by,

459
00:30:14,655 --> 00:30:16,407
as soon as possible.

460
00:30:17,408 --> 00:30:20,201
I'm beginning to feel
totally cut off from the world.

461
00:30:22,245 --> 00:30:23,663
And this fog
doesn't exactly help.

462
00:30:23,871 --> 00:30:25,581
It's never lasted
this long before.

463
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,417
Well, that's true, ma'am.

464
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:28,918
Even the seagulls

465
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:30,420
have gone quiet.

466
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,673
Anne!

467
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,801
Anne, I can't hear you!

468
00:30:37,677 --> 00:30:42,056
"And Isaac spake unto Abraham,
his father, and said, 'My father."'

469
00:30:42,223 --> 00:30:45,977
Incidentally, Mrs. Mills, I've had
to put up with Lydia running around

470
00:30:46,185 --> 00:30:48,146
above my head. She's been
hurtling backwards and forwards

471
00:30:48,353 --> 00:30:49,646
as if there were three of her.

472
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:52,024
Would you kindly tell her
it's not necessary

473
00:30:52,232 --> 00:30:54,818
to kick up quite such a rumpus
just to do a little cleaning?

474
00:30:55,861 --> 00:30:59,156
- I couldn't bear another migraine.
- I'll tell her, ma'am.

475
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:01,450
Thank you.

476
00:31:48,578 --> 00:31:51,665
Now she's really
gone too far. Lydia!

477
00:31:52,457 --> 00:31:53,333
Lydia!

478
00:32:13,144 --> 00:32:17,731
"...on the mount of the Lord
shall be seen. And the angel..."

479
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,441
What's going on up there?

480
00:32:19,942 --> 00:32:21,694
Nothing, mummy, I'm just
reading like you told me.

481
00:32:22,736 --> 00:32:25,447
- Did you hear it as well?
- Hear what?

482
00:32:30,828 --> 00:32:31,954
"And the angel of the Lord

483
00:32:32,162 --> 00:32:36,542
called unto Abraham out of heaven
the second time, and said,

484
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,253
'By myself have
I sworn, saith the Lord..."'

485
00:32:50,221 --> 00:32:51,180
What was that?

486
00:32:51,764 --> 00:32:52,682
I don't know.

487
00:32:53,725 --> 00:32:55,351
Anne, tell me
who's making that noise.

488
00:32:56,477 --> 00:32:57,979
I can't tell you, mummy.

489
00:32:58,938 --> 00:32:59,814
You tell me!

490
00:33:00,523 --> 00:33:03,693
I told you there was someone
in the room and you punished me.

491
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:05,361
Now I don't know what to say!

492
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:07,071
Anne, I want the truth!

493
00:33:09,282 --> 00:33:11,284
Tell me if there is
someone upstairs.

494
00:33:14,078 --> 00:33:15,830
There. In that junk room.

495
00:34:05,586 --> 00:34:07,505
Mummy, you're letting
the light in!

496
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,306
She's here.

497
00:35:04,184 --> 00:35:06,687
Mummy, she says she's here.

498
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,858
She's watching us.
She's watching us!

499
00:35:34,213 --> 00:35:35,423
Where did they go?

500
00:35:35,673 --> 00:35:37,759
They just came past here.
Didn't you see them?

501
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:38,968
Which way did they go?

502
00:35:39,677 --> 00:35:41,763
Over there, over there,
oh, and down there, as well.

503
00:35:49,061 --> 00:35:51,188
They're everywhere.
They say this house is theirs.

504
00:35:52,939 --> 00:35:55,817
And they say they're going
to take the curtains down as well.

505
00:35:58,153 --> 00:36:00,781
- Ma'am, stay calm, please.
- I will not stay clam!

506
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:02,574
For 5 whole years
during the occupation,

507
00:36:02,783 --> 00:36:05,285
I managed to avoid a single Nazi
ever stepping foot in this house!

508
00:36:05,494 --> 00:36:08,163
And now there is someone here,
under my nose, opening and closing

509
00:36:08,413 --> 00:36:11,375
- the doors.
- Ma'am, this is a very old house.

510
00:36:11,917 --> 00:36:14,169
Why, the floorboards squeak,
and the plumbing clanks, and...

511
00:36:14,419 --> 00:36:18,255
There were voices, I'm telling you.
A boy and 2 women talking together.

512
00:36:18,506 --> 00:36:19,715
Mummy, look!

513
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,969
I did it yesterday.

514
00:36:24,845 --> 00:36:26,430
This is the father,
this is the mother,

515
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:29,642
this is Victor
and this is the old woman.

516
00:36:29,892 --> 00:36:31,936
What do these numbers stand for?

517
00:36:32,144 --> 00:36:33,980
That's the number
of times I've seen them.

518
00:36:34,188 --> 00:36:36,482
I see the old woman the most.

519
00:36:41,153 --> 00:36:42,196
Oh, God in Heaven!

520
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:43,406
Mrs. Mills,

521
00:36:43,614 --> 00:36:45,490
go and call Mr. Tuttle. Tell him
we have to search the whole house,

522
00:36:45,699 --> 00:36:47,117
immediately,
before it gets dark.

523
00:36:47,617 --> 00:36:48,952
Yes, ma'am.
There now.

524
00:36:49,202 --> 00:36:51,204
- Mummy...
- Yes, darling. It's all right,

525
00:36:51,746 --> 00:36:54,290
nothing's going to happen
to you while mummy's here.

526
00:36:54,874 --> 00:36:55,667
Look, mummy,

527
00:36:56,334 --> 00:36:57,585
she really scares me.

528
00:36:57,961 --> 00:36:59,087
It's as if she's
not looking at you,

529
00:36:59,337 --> 00:37:00,630
but she can see you.

530
00:37:00,922 --> 00:37:03,591
And she's always around,
saying, "Come with meee..."

531
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,261
- Oh, Anne, don't lie to me.
- Honestly, mummy.

532
00:37:06,553 --> 00:37:08,179
And she asks me things.

533
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,306
Victor told me she's a witch.

534
00:37:10,724 --> 00:37:11,850
What does she ask you?

535
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,560
Things.

536
00:37:15,728 --> 00:37:17,771
Her breath smells.

537
00:37:21,692 --> 00:37:23,736
We have to open
all the curtains.

538
00:37:23,902 --> 00:37:25,446
I don't want any dark corners

539
00:37:25,612 --> 00:37:26,739
- where someone could hide.
- Yes, ma'am.

540
00:37:26,947 --> 00:37:29,450
You both search the right side
and I'll take the left.

541
00:37:29,658 --> 00:37:31,243
Then we'll search upstairs.

542
00:38:42,646 --> 00:38:46,315
Perhaps they are ghosts who lived
in this house before and who...

543
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:49,276
Don't be stupid.
I've already told you

544
00:38:49,443 --> 00:38:51,862
ghosts go about in white sheets
and carry chains and go...

545
00:38:53,948 --> 00:38:54,740
Anne...

546
00:38:55,449 --> 00:38:57,410
why do you
make up such stories?

547
00:38:57,618 --> 00:38:59,704
I don't.
I read them in books.

548
00:38:59,912 --> 00:39:02,707
Well, you shouldn't believe
everything you read in books.

549
00:39:02,915 --> 00:39:04,542
That's what our mother says.

550
00:39:04,917 --> 00:39:07,753
She says that all this stuff
about ghosts is rubbish.

551
00:39:07,962 --> 00:39:11,132
And then she expects us
to believe everything written

552
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,676
- in the Bible.
- And you don't believe it?

553
00:39:13,843 --> 00:39:14,926
I believe some things.

554
00:39:15,135 --> 00:39:19,764
But, for example, I don't believe
God made the world in seven days.

555
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,935
And I don't believe that Noah got
all those animals into one boat.

556
00:39:24,311 --> 00:39:25,603
Or the Holy Spirit

557
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:28,940
- is a dove.
- No, I don't believe that either.

558
00:39:29,149 --> 00:39:32,277
- Doves are anything but holy.
- They pooh on our windows.

559
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:41,661
Have you mentioned
any of this to your mother?

560
00:40:47,516 --> 00:40:48,558
Ma'am?

561
00:40:49,518 --> 00:40:50,143
Yes?

562
00:40:51,979 --> 00:40:54,940
They've searched everywhere, ma'am.
There's no one.

563
00:40:55,649 --> 00:40:56,566
I see.

564
00:40:58,902 --> 00:41:00,237
Mrs. Mills?

565
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:02,864
Yes, ma'am?

566
00:41:04,157 --> 00:41:06,326
Do you have any idea
what this might be?

567
00:41:08,328 --> 00:41:11,665
- Oh, it's a photograph album, ma'am.
- No, but look, they're all asleep.

568
00:41:12,457 --> 00:41:13,249
Look.

569
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,084
They're not asleep, ma'am.

570
00:41:15,292 --> 00:41:16,293
They're dead.

571
00:41:18,796 --> 00:41:20,089
It's a book of the dead.

572
00:41:20,297 --> 00:41:23,926
In the last century, I believe they
used to take photographs of the dead

573
00:41:24,176 --> 00:41:25,761
in the hope that their souls

574
00:41:25,928 --> 00:41:28,639
would go on living
through the portraits.

575
00:41:31,684 --> 00:41:33,519
There are even group portraits.

576
00:41:35,563 --> 00:41:36,647
And children!

577
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,025
It's macabre.

578
00:41:41,444 --> 00:41:43,820
How could these people
be so superstitious?

579
00:41:44,988 --> 00:41:46,573
Grief over the death
of a loved one

580
00:41:46,823 --> 00:41:50,201
can lead people
to do the strangest things.

581
00:41:53,913 --> 00:41:56,791
Get rid of it.
I don't want it in the house.

582
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,043
Yes, ma'am.

583
00:42:11,348 --> 00:42:13,807
Mrs. Mills, it's cold. Why don't you
come and sit by the fire?

584
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,405
Thank you very much, ma'am.

585
00:42:29,865 --> 00:42:32,618
So, tell me about
when you worked here before.

586
00:42:33,452 --> 00:42:35,120
Did you have to look
after children then as well?

587
00:42:35,788 --> 00:42:39,124
No, I was in charge
of organising the housework.

588
00:42:41,001 --> 00:42:42,251
Were there many servants?

589
00:42:43,211 --> 00:42:45,296
Oh, about fifteen.

590
00:42:46,673 --> 00:42:47,590
Though in the end

591
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:49,634
there were just
the three of us left.

592
00:42:49,884 --> 00:42:50,677
Why?

593
00:42:51,386 --> 00:42:53,763
My employers moved to London.

594
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:56,474
They came here less

595
00:42:56,724 --> 00:42:59,102
and less, it being so
out of the way like...

596
00:42:59,978 --> 00:43:04,023
And so gradually
the house just became empty.

597
00:43:05,608 --> 00:43:07,944
Everybody ends up
leaving this damned island.

598
00:43:10,071 --> 00:43:14,199
My family left in the summer
of 1940, just before the invasion.

599
00:43:16,118 --> 00:43:18,078
That was the last
I ever heard of them.

600
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:24,668
I don't blame them.

601
00:43:26,128 --> 00:43:28,130
Actually, we left too.

602
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:32,926
Although, you know sometimes
when you leave a place,

603
00:43:33,802 --> 00:43:36,096
it's like it's there with you

604
00:43:36,305 --> 00:43:37,848
all the time.

605
00:43:38,223 --> 00:43:40,767
I always felt like
I never left this house.

606
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:42,393
Why did you leave?

607
00:43:43,811 --> 00:43:47,315
Oh, on account of the tuberculosis.
The whole area was evacuated.

608
00:43:51,986 --> 00:43:53,821
Was that when Lydia went dumb?

609
00:43:54,905 --> 00:43:56,699
Yes, I think so.

610
00:43:57,325 --> 00:44:00,244
Though you know,
my memory is a bit rusty

611
00:44:00,453 --> 00:44:02,621
- these days, ma'am.
- What happened to her?

612
00:44:08,586 --> 00:44:11,880
Well, suddenly,
one day, she just

613
00:44:13,673 --> 00:44:14,924
stopped talking.

614
00:44:15,383 --> 00:44:17,052
Well, there must
have been a reason.

615
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:20,472
People don't just stop talking.

616
00:44:21,014 --> 00:44:24,309
These things are always
the result of some sort of trauma.

617
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,395
Something must
have happened to her.

618
00:44:31,858 --> 00:44:34,569
- Did your employers treat her well?
- Oh, they were always

619
00:44:34,778 --> 00:44:38,073
very kind to us.
They treated us just like family.

620
00:44:41,034 --> 00:44:43,869
You know, ma'am,
I think I will go to bed.

621
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:46,747
I'll never be able
to get up in the morning.

622
00:44:47,081 --> 00:44:48,123
Off you go.

623
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:50,459
I'm going to stay
here a while longer.

624
00:44:51,335 --> 00:44:52,252
Yes, ma'am.

625
00:45:26,577 --> 00:45:28,871
I'm sorry I was
so hard on you.

626
00:45:36,838 --> 00:45:38,298
Can you forgive me?

627
00:45:44,636 --> 00:45:45,429
Anne.

628
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,242
- Mummy.
- What?

629
00:46:08,243 --> 00:46:09,786
When's daddy coming home?

630
00:46:11,245 --> 00:46:12,788
When the war's over.

631
00:46:13,956 --> 00:46:16,542
Why did he go to war?
I mean,

632
00:46:16,751 --> 00:46:19,003
nobody's done
anything bad to us.

633
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:21,756
Daddy went...

634
00:46:25,468 --> 00:46:27,595
Daddy went because
he's very brave,

635
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:33,601
and because he wasn't prepared to
let the Germans tell him what to do.

636
00:46:34,769 --> 00:46:36,062
Why?

637
00:46:44,402 --> 00:46:45,612
Charles...

638
00:46:48,281 --> 00:46:49,449
Where are you?

639
00:49:37,696 --> 00:49:39,113
Mrs. Mills!

640
00:49:40,948 --> 00:49:42,324
Mrs. Mills!

641
00:49:43,617 --> 00:49:45,035
What's the matter, ma'am?

642
00:49:45,536 --> 00:49:48,664
The key to the music room!
Give it to me! Quickly!

643
00:49:48,914 --> 00:49:50,582
- What's happening?
- Come on!

644
00:50:00,509 --> 00:50:01,593
Oh, my God!

645
00:50:05,597 --> 00:50:07,391
I checked that room myself.

646
00:50:10,018 --> 00:50:11,185
It was empty.

647
00:50:12,103 --> 00:50:13,813
Now take these tablets, ma'am.

648
00:50:14,689 --> 00:50:16,065
They'll do you good.

649
00:50:16,232 --> 00:50:18,359
And yet I felt as if
there was someone else there.

650
00:50:21,154 --> 00:50:22,697
And it wasn't human.

651
00:50:23,656 --> 00:50:26,200
There is something in this house.

652
00:50:27,201 --> 00:50:28,911
Something diabolic.

653
00:50:29,162 --> 00:50:30,079
Ma'am...

654
00:50:30,455 --> 00:50:32,290
Something which is not...

655
00:50:35,251 --> 00:50:36,628
not at rest.

656
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:42,716
I know you don't believe it.

657
00:50:44,092 --> 00:50:45,552
You don't believe it, do you?

658
00:50:46,386 --> 00:50:47,596
No, I don't blame you.

659
00:50:48,347 --> 00:50:50,891
I... I used to not
believe those things.

660
00:50:53,477 --> 00:50:55,187
I do believe it, ma'am.

661
00:50:58,607 --> 00:51:00,817
I've always believed
in those things.

662
00:51:01,526 --> 00:51:04,696
Oh, they're not easy
to explain, but they do happen.

663
00:51:05,906 --> 00:51:09,909
We've all heard
stories of the beyond,

664
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,328
now and then.

665
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:15,539
And I think that, sometimes,

666
00:51:16,791 --> 00:51:17,833
the world...

667
00:51:19,835 --> 00:51:23,381
of the dead gets
mixed up with the world

668
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:24,590
of the living.

669
00:51:26,133 --> 00:51:29,762
But it's impossible! The Lord would
never allow such an aberration!

670
00:51:30,012 --> 00:51:33,599
The living and the dead, they will
only meet at the end of eternity.

671
00:51:36,519 --> 00:51:38,687
- It says so in the Bible.
- Ma'am,

672
00:51:40,939 --> 00:51:43,984
there isn't always
an answer for everything.

673
00:51:56,705 --> 00:51:58,290
Where are you off to, ma'am?

674
00:51:58,832 --> 00:52:01,167
I'm going to the village
to pay Father Legrand a visit.

675
00:52:01,793 --> 00:52:04,546
If he won't come here, then I shall
go to him. And I'll bring him back.

676
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:07,756
- Wait till the weather improves.
- I've waited long enough.

677
00:52:09,466 --> 00:52:11,260
Ma'am, the priest told me...

678
00:52:11,468 --> 00:52:15,306
I don't care what he told you!
I want him to tell me personally.

679
00:52:15,764 --> 00:52:17,016
He must come today.

680
00:52:17,224 --> 00:52:21,437
- What are you going to tell him?
- We've searched every room in there.

681
00:52:22,271 --> 00:52:24,064
And now I need them
to be blessed.

682
00:52:26,317 --> 00:52:29,111
Ma'am, please wait.
It's still very early.

683
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,822
- Mr. Tuttle.
- Good morning, ma'am.

684
00:52:32,072 --> 00:52:34,908
I need you to search
the whole garden for gravestones.

685
00:52:35,159 --> 00:52:36,952
- Gravestones?
- When my husband bought this house,

686
00:52:37,201 --> 00:52:38,953
we were told there was
a little cemetery.

687
00:52:39,203 --> 00:52:41,581
I think it was somewhere
over there, amongst the trees.

688
00:52:41,748 --> 00:52:44,000
- I've not seen anything.
- Check carefully.

689
00:52:44,751 --> 00:52:46,836
- They could be overgrown.
- Yes, ma'am.

690
00:52:47,045 --> 00:52:49,422
I need to know if there was
a family buried here.

691
00:52:49,631 --> 00:52:51,883
And if they had
a little boy, Victor.

692
00:53:08,106 --> 00:53:10,275
Now she thinks
the house is haunted.

693
00:53:11,193 --> 00:53:13,362
Do you think it's safe
to let her go?

694
00:53:14,154 --> 00:53:16,865
Oh, don't worry.
The fog won't let her get very far.

695
00:53:17,074 --> 00:53:20,327
Oh, yes, the fog.
The fog... of course.

696
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:25,540
And when do you think we should
bring all this out into the open?

697
00:53:26,541 --> 00:53:30,253
All in good time,
Mr. Tuttle, all in good time.

698
00:53:31,296 --> 00:53:32,881
Speaking of which...

699
00:55:27,659 --> 00:55:28,326
Charles!

700
00:55:30,286 --> 00:55:30,954
Grace.

701
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,636
You're here!
You're here!

702
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:50,722
They... they said
there was no hope.

703
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,684
They said I should
give you up for dead.

704
00:55:54,643 --> 00:55:56,103
They say a lot of things.

705
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,903
Thank you, thank you, God.

706
00:56:05,486 --> 00:56:06,696
Thank you.

707
00:56:07,571 --> 00:56:09,323
Every night
I've prayed for this.

708
00:56:10,574 --> 00:56:12,451
Begging God to bring you back.

709
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:17,748
To bring the children
their father back. You're here.

710
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:23,337
But where have you been
all this time?

711
00:56:24,755 --> 00:56:27,925
Out there,
looking for my home.

712
00:56:35,849 --> 00:56:37,684
You're so different.

713
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:40,437
So different.

714
00:56:41,271 --> 00:56:43,106
Sometimes I bleed.

715
00:57:20,976 --> 00:57:21,810
Ma'am.

716
00:57:24,647 --> 00:57:25,648
Mrs. Mills,

717
00:57:28,567 --> 00:57:29,818
this is my husband.

718
00:57:33,697 --> 00:57:36,240
I'm very pleased
to meet you, sir.

719
00:57:36,658 --> 00:57:37,951
He's very weak.

720
00:57:42,372 --> 00:57:44,958
I want you to prepare
a hot bath and some clean clothes.

721
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,168
And something to eat.

722
00:57:47,877 --> 00:57:48,962
Right away, ma'am.

723
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,023
How are my little ones?

724
00:58:12,776 --> 00:58:13,568
Daddy!

725
00:58:16,989 --> 00:58:19,116
Why did you take so long?

726
00:58:26,415 --> 00:58:27,499
Hello, Nicholas.

727
00:58:28,083 --> 00:58:28,834
I told you, you see!

728
00:58:29,001 --> 00:58:30,544
I told you he'd come back.

729
00:58:38,217 --> 00:58:41,345
- Have you both been well behaved?
- We've been very good.

730
00:58:41,554 --> 00:58:44,181
- Have you been good to your mother?
- Very good.

731
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:46,851
We study every day
for our First Communion.

732
00:58:48,227 --> 00:58:49,645
Daddy, did you kill anyone?

733
00:58:57,236 --> 00:58:58,195
Here he comes.

734
00:59:02,408 --> 00:59:04,951
Darling, we've prepared
lunch for you.

735
00:59:06,036 --> 00:59:07,912
Are you coming down
or would you prefer that?

736
00:59:20,342 --> 00:59:21,927
When's daddy coming down?

737
00:59:22,135 --> 00:59:24,554
Be patient, Anne.
Daddy is...

738
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:26,181
not well.

739
00:59:26,723 --> 00:59:28,767
He said he'd seen
lots of dead men.

740
00:59:33,646 --> 00:59:37,066
Mummy, when people die
in the war, where do they go?

741
00:59:37,816 --> 00:59:38,817
Ah, what a question.

742
00:59:39,735 --> 00:59:40,819
It depends.

743
00:59:41,779 --> 00:59:42,821
On what?

744
00:59:42,988 --> 00:59:43,656
Well...

745
00:59:43,906 --> 00:59:46,659
on whether they fought on the side
of the "goodies" or the "baddies."

746
00:59:47,326 --> 00:59:50,496
Your father, for example, fought for
England, on the "goodies"' side.

747
00:59:53,832 --> 00:59:55,709
How do you know who
the "goodies" and the "baddies" are?

748
00:59:57,127 --> 01:00:00,130
That's enough questions. Eat
your food. You'll never go to war.

749
01:00:00,631 --> 01:00:02,258
We'll never go anywhere.

750
01:00:05,551 --> 01:00:07,512
You're not missing out on anything.

751
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:12,183
You're much better at home with
mummy and daddy, who love you.

752
01:00:14,686 --> 01:00:15,603
And the intruders.

753
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:19,190
There are no intruders here.

754
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,026
But you said that there were.

755
01:00:22,235 --> 01:00:23,569
No, I said that
there are no intruders here.

756
01:00:23,778 --> 01:00:25,655
And I don't want to hear
another word on the subject.

757
01:00:25,863 --> 01:00:27,573
- But you said...
- No, that is enough!

758
01:00:29,117 --> 01:00:31,035
- Can I say something?
- No!

759
01:00:31,244 --> 01:00:33,954
- Why not?
- Because... because you can't!

760
01:00:41,169 --> 01:00:42,671
Anne, stop breathing like that.

761
01:00:45,424 --> 01:00:46,592
You heard me. Stop it!

762
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:51,930
Stop breathing!

763
01:00:54,683 --> 01:00:55,976
Right, you go to your room!

764
01:00:56,351 --> 01:00:58,562
Go to your room!
There's no dessert for you today.

765
01:01:05,318 --> 01:01:07,945
Oh, no crying now.
No crying.

766
01:01:08,946 --> 01:01:10,448
Oh, stop that... Here.

767
01:01:10,948 --> 01:01:13,451
Oh, look what an awful face
you've got when you cry.

768
01:01:13,659 --> 01:01:17,121
- I don't care!
- There, there.

769
01:01:17,663 --> 01:01:19,165
You listen to me.

770
01:01:21,417 --> 01:01:23,127
I've seen them too.

771
01:01:24,337 --> 01:01:25,338
You have?

772
01:01:26,339 --> 01:01:27,256
Yes.

773
01:01:28,132 --> 01:01:30,843
Then why don't you tell my mother?
Then maybe she'll believe me.

774
01:01:31,052 --> 01:01:33,970
There are things
your mother doesn't want to hear.

775
01:01:34,638 --> 01:01:36,014
She only believes in what

776
01:01:36,181 --> 01:01:38,266
she was taught.
But don't worry.

777
01:01:39,434 --> 01:01:40,810
Sooner or later,

778
01:01:42,145 --> 01:01:45,190
she'll see them.
And then everything

779
01:01:45,398 --> 01:01:47,901
- will be different.
- How?

780
01:01:49,361 --> 01:01:51,112
Oh, you'll see.

781
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:53,198
There are going to be some

782
01:01:53,406 --> 01:01:54,574
big surprises.

783
01:01:55,825 --> 01:01:56,785
There are going to be...

784
01:01:58,411 --> 01:01:59,621
changes.

785
01:02:00,497 --> 01:02:01,706
Changes?

786
01:02:13,717 --> 01:02:15,344
Now she is behaving as if

787
01:02:15,594 --> 01:02:16,971
nothing had happened.

788
01:02:18,597 --> 01:02:20,057
What about her daughter?

789
01:02:20,724 --> 01:02:24,603
She's not so stubborn. The children
will be easier to convince.

790
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:29,191
No, it's the mother who is going
to cause us problems.

791
01:02:31,318 --> 01:02:33,945
Do you think her husband
suspects anything?

792
01:02:35,655 --> 01:02:39,284
No, I don't think
he even knows where he is.

793
01:02:55,758 --> 01:02:58,011
Look what a pretty daughter
I've got.

794
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:03,682
Mummy made this veil
especially for you.

795
01:03:05,517 --> 01:03:07,060
I look like a bride.

796
01:03:08,937 --> 01:03:11,315
Yes, you do.

797
01:03:16,194 --> 01:03:18,488
Now I need to shorten
the sleeves a little.

798
01:03:19,489 --> 01:03:20,991
- You can take it off now.
- No.

799
01:03:21,158 --> 01:03:23,577
Anne, this dress has to be
spotless for your First Communion.

800
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:25,287
I promise I won't dirty it.

801
01:03:25,495 --> 01:03:28,206
Just let me wear it for
a little longer. Just a little.

802
01:03:28,373 --> 01:03:29,917
Oh, just a little.

803
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:32,251
All right.

804
01:03:33,711 --> 01:03:35,171
I'll be back shortly.

805
01:03:35,588 --> 01:03:38,341
No sitting on the floor.
No leaning against the walls.

806
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:58,152
Monsieur, would you like to dance?

807
01:04:01,529 --> 01:04:02,906
I'd love to.

808
01:04:26,471 --> 01:04:29,724
Charles, you can't go on like this.
You must eat something.

809
01:04:52,037 --> 01:04:53,372
...in the sky.

810
01:04:55,916 --> 01:05:00,087
I don't know
if it's cloudy or bright,

811
01:05:02,297 --> 01:05:05,091
because I only have eyes

812
01:05:06,593 --> 01:05:07,969
for you...

813
01:05:09,178 --> 01:05:10,179
dear...

814
01:05:11,347 --> 01:05:14,559
The moon may be high...

815
01:05:47,633 --> 01:05:49,676
Anne, you need to take
the dress off now.

816
01:05:53,931 --> 01:05:55,682
Anne, are you listening?

817
01:05:58,268 --> 01:05:59,061
Anne?

818
01:06:04,065 --> 01:06:06,442
What did I tell you
about sitting on the floor?

819
01:06:06,692 --> 01:06:07,735
But it's clean.

820
01:06:07,944 --> 01:06:11,113
It makes no difference. Why
can't you ever do as you're told?

821
01:06:35,845 --> 01:06:36,805
What's the matter?

822
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:39,015
Where is my daughter?

823
01:06:42,811 --> 01:06:44,562
What have you done
with my daughter?

824
01:06:44,938 --> 01:06:47,983
Are you mad?
I am your daughter.

825
01:06:49,651 --> 01:06:50,819
You're not!
You're not

826
01:06:51,027 --> 01:06:51,945
my daughter!

827
01:06:56,741 --> 01:06:58,702
You're not my daughter!

828
01:07:14,008 --> 01:07:16,719
- Ma'am, I heard shouts.
- She wants to kill me!

829
01:07:16,969 --> 01:07:19,346
She won't stop
until she kills us!

830
01:07:19,513 --> 01:07:22,266
She won't stop!
She won't stop until she kills us!

831
01:07:22,433 --> 01:07:25,436
- Hush. Hush, child. Come with me.
- You're wicked! You're wicked!

832
01:07:26,562 --> 01:07:28,022
Wicked!

833
01:07:38,907 --> 01:07:39,866
How is she?

834
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:44,287
There's no calming her
so I've left her with her father.

835
01:07:45,455 --> 01:07:47,624
She insisted
on speaking with him.

836
01:07:51,336 --> 01:07:52,253
What happened?

837
01:07:53,463 --> 01:07:54,422
Why did you fight?

838
01:07:54,923 --> 01:07:56,007
It wasn't her.

839
01:07:57,467 --> 01:08:00,302
It was the old woman
with the strange eyes.

840
01:08:00,469 --> 01:08:02,971
She was imitating
my daughter's voice.

841
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:05,682
I'd swear to God that
it wasn't my daughter.

842
01:08:08,644 --> 01:08:11,063
Oh, God.
God help me.

843
01:08:13,023 --> 01:08:15,025
God help me.
What's the matter with me?

844
01:08:16,109 --> 01:08:17,819
I don't know what's
the matter with me.

845
01:08:19,196 --> 01:08:21,114
You must get some rest.

846
01:08:23,492 --> 01:08:27,287
You can't take on all
the responsibility of this house.

847
01:08:28,330 --> 01:08:29,372
Leave it to us.

848
01:08:29,830 --> 01:08:31,707
We know what has to be done.

849
01:08:35,461 --> 01:08:36,754
What do you mean by that?

850
01:08:38,631 --> 01:08:40,549
What do you mean you know
what has to be done?

851
01:08:40,841 --> 01:08:42,468
Nothing, ma'am.
I was just suggesting...

852
01:08:42,635 --> 01:08:44,011
There's nothing to suggest!

853
01:08:46,013 --> 01:08:48,766
Who do you think you are? You
have no idea what has to be done!

854
01:08:54,146 --> 01:08:55,231
Or do you?

855
01:08:59,025 --> 01:09:00,360
What are these?

856
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:05,949
The tablets
for the migraine, ma'am.

857
01:09:07,492 --> 01:09:08,785
The ones you always take.

858
01:09:10,495 --> 01:09:12,122
Please, I need to be on my own.

859
01:09:14,124 --> 01:09:15,208
Yes, ma'am.

860
01:09:38,856 --> 01:09:40,024
Come on, child.

861
01:10:03,504 --> 01:10:05,048
Anne told me everything.

862
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:14,515
I wish I had
an explanation, but I haven't.

863
01:10:15,558 --> 01:10:17,435
At first I thought there was
someone else in the house.

864
01:10:17,644 --> 01:10:18,978
I even thought that
there were ghosts.

865
01:10:19,312 --> 01:10:20,897
I'm not talking about the ghosts.

866
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:24,901
I'm talking about
what happened that day.

867
01:10:32,532 --> 01:10:35,619
I don't know what
you're talking about.

868
01:10:36,119 --> 01:10:37,746
Tell me what happened.

869
01:10:39,456 --> 01:10:40,415
Happened?

870
01:10:46,421 --> 01:10:47,297
I don't know what

871
01:10:47,506 --> 01:10:49,299
happened to me.

872
01:10:51,093 --> 01:10:53,345
The servants had left
during the night.

873
01:10:53,595 --> 01:10:56,640
They hadn't the courage
to tell me to my face.

874
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:00,559
And they knew

875
01:11:01,811 --> 01:11:04,063
that I couldn't leave the house.

876
01:11:05,481 --> 01:11:06,774
They knew.

877
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:11,112
Anne.

878
01:11:13,072 --> 01:11:15,408
Anne, what happened?

879
01:11:17,868 --> 01:11:19,537
She hit me.

880
01:11:20,371 --> 01:11:23,165
She went mad...
like she did that day.

881
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,543
Do you remember?

882
01:11:27,544 --> 01:11:28,336
No.

883
01:11:31,006 --> 01:11:32,757
You must forgive me, Charles.

884
01:11:34,843 --> 01:11:35,719
Not me.

885
01:11:37,137 --> 01:11:37,929
The children.

886
01:11:39,055 --> 01:11:40,765
They know that I love them.

887
01:11:42,225 --> 01:11:46,021
They know I'd never hurt them.
I... I'd die first.

888
01:11:50,066 --> 01:11:51,359
What are you going to do?

889
01:11:53,153 --> 01:11:54,863
Are you angry with me?

890
01:11:59,116 --> 01:12:03,329
I came back to say goodbye to my
wife and children. Now I must go.

891
01:12:05,247 --> 01:12:06,206
Go where?

892
01:12:08,083 --> 01:12:09,084
To the front.

893
01:12:09,627 --> 01:12:10,669
The war's over.

894
01:12:11,962 --> 01:12:13,631
The war is not over.

895
01:12:13,797 --> 01:12:15,341
What are you talking about?

896
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,555
You're not going, do you hear me?
You left us once already. You can't!

897
01:12:23,557 --> 01:12:24,350
Why?

898
01:12:24,850 --> 01:12:26,644
Why did you have
to go to that stupid

899
01:12:26,851 --> 01:12:29,229
war that had nothing
to do with us?

900
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:32,106
Why couldn't you have stayed here

901
01:12:32,273 --> 01:12:34,192
- like the others did?
- The others surrendered.

902
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:35,860
We all surrendered!

903
01:12:36,945 --> 01:12:38,947
The whole island was occupied!

904
01:12:39,948 --> 01:12:41,950
What did you expect?

905
01:12:47,288 --> 01:12:52,168
What were you trying to prove by
going to war? Your place was here,

906
01:12:54,295 --> 01:12:55,713
with us, your family.

907
01:13:02,135 --> 01:13:03,512
I loved you...

908
01:13:05,555 --> 01:13:07,349
and that was enough for me...

909
01:13:08,475 --> 01:13:11,228
living in this darkness...

910
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:14,731
in this prison.

911
01:13:17,859 --> 01:13:19,570
But not for you...

912
01:13:21,154 --> 01:13:23,323
I wasn't enough for you.

913
01:13:24,283 --> 01:13:26,200
That's why you left.

914
01:13:29,412 --> 01:13:30,997
It wasn't just the war.

915
01:13:34,333 --> 01:13:36,752
You want to leave me, don't you?

916
01:14:27,092 --> 01:14:29,303
Forgive me, Grace.

917
01:15:43,542 --> 01:15:44,751
Anne!

918
01:15:46,211 --> 01:15:47,421
Nicholas!

919
01:15:57,930 --> 01:15:58,848
Oh, my God!

920
01:16:05,396 --> 01:16:06,188
Oh, my God!

921
01:16:07,773 --> 01:16:09,650
Wait! Oh, my God!

922
01:16:30,462 --> 01:16:31,838
Where are the curtains?

923
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:38,720
Mrs. Mills!

924
01:16:54,069 --> 01:16:54,902
Let me see.

925
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:56,528
Let me see.

926
01:16:57,404 --> 01:16:58,405
Are you alright?

927
01:16:59,156 --> 01:16:59,949
You're alright!

928
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:01,283
I want my daddy!

929
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:08,958
Daddy's gone.

930
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:10,668
It's not true.

931
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:12,878
Yes, it is!

932
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:15,714
It is true.

933
01:17:18,425 --> 01:17:20,094
I love you, mummy.

934
01:17:28,393 --> 01:17:30,103
Find the curtains.

935
01:17:33,189 --> 01:17:34,190
Who was it?

936
01:17:34,774 --> 01:17:35,692
Who did this?

937
01:17:36,901 --> 01:17:37,986
Tell me!

938
01:17:38,903 --> 01:17:39,737
Tell me!

939
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:44,325
You know what's happening here.
You know because it happened

940
01:17:44,534 --> 01:17:46,786
to you too!
Now tell me!

941
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:50,290
Write it down.
Write it down!

942
01:17:51,124 --> 01:17:51,833
Please.

943
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:54,876
That attitude
won't solve anything, ma'am.

944
01:17:56,795 --> 01:17:58,338
And anyway she can't write.

945
01:17:58,589 --> 01:18:00,007
- Where are they?
- What?

946
01:18:00,382 --> 01:18:01,550
The curtains!

947
01:18:02,259 --> 01:18:05,888
The curtains my children's lives
depend on! Someone has taken them!

948
01:18:06,096 --> 01:18:09,683
I have noticed, ma'am. There's
no need for you to raise your voice.

949
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,770
Oh, Mr. Tuttle, I was just
on the point of calling you.

950
01:18:14,938 --> 01:18:17,774
Did you know someone's
taken all the curtains?

951
01:18:19,484 --> 01:18:20,444
The curtains?

952
01:18:22,029 --> 01:18:23,196
Oh, dear.

953
01:18:24,447 --> 01:18:25,656
Why should anyone

954
01:18:25,865 --> 01:18:27,283
want to take
all the curtains?

955
01:18:28,618 --> 01:18:31,203
Oh, to let some daylight
into this house, I imagine.

956
01:18:32,371 --> 01:18:34,457
Daylight... of course.

957
01:18:35,374 --> 01:18:37,084
Someone wants
to kill my children!

958
01:18:37,585 --> 01:18:39,795
Now why do you think
the daylight would kill them?

959
01:18:41,631 --> 01:18:42,632
Are you mad?

960
01:18:44,091 --> 01:18:45,343
I told you.

961
01:18:46,594 --> 01:18:49,013
I already told you,
the children are photosensitive!

962
01:18:49,222 --> 01:18:52,225
- The light will kill them!
- Yes, but that was

963
01:18:52,475 --> 01:18:53,600
before.

964
01:18:54,267 --> 01:18:56,519
The condition could have
cleared up by itself.

965
01:18:56,895 --> 01:18:59,105
I mean, if you never
expose them to daylight,

966
01:18:59,314 --> 01:19:00,899
how do you know
they're not cured?

967
01:19:01,566 --> 01:19:05,570
My sister-in-law used to get
terrible attacks of rheumatism

968
01:19:06,112 --> 01:19:07,572
in her legs and back.

969
01:19:09,074 --> 01:19:10,325
Then one fine day,

970
01:19:12,661 --> 01:19:13,954
they disappeared.

971
01:19:16,206 --> 01:19:19,084
I'm going to find those curtains,
and when you have finished helping

972
01:19:19,292 --> 01:19:21,086
me hang them,
you will leave this house.

973
01:19:35,307 --> 01:19:36,892
What about the master, ma'am?

974
01:19:37,643 --> 01:19:38,811
What does he have
to say about all this?

975
01:19:40,854 --> 01:19:41,981
Give me your keys.

976
01:19:43,649 --> 01:19:45,150
I want your keys now.

977
01:19:49,446 --> 01:19:50,614
I know what you want.

978
01:19:51,824 --> 01:19:52,907
You want to frighten us.

979
01:19:53,241 --> 01:19:54,534
You want to get us out,
me and my children.

980
01:19:54,784 --> 01:19:57,537
You've wanted to take over
this house ever since you arrived.

981
01:19:58,955 --> 01:20:02,125
Now, you give me those keys.
I will not ask again.

982
01:20:02,333 --> 01:20:03,918
You should try
and calm down, ma'am.

983
01:20:04,419 --> 01:20:06,713
Give me the keys!

984
01:20:08,673 --> 01:20:09,799
Give them to me!

985
01:20:16,514 --> 01:20:17,765
And now, get out of here.

986
01:20:36,199 --> 01:20:37,868
You know something, Mr. Tuttle?

987
01:20:39,244 --> 01:20:43,207
I think I've reached the end
of my tether. What about you?

988
01:20:44,625 --> 01:20:45,584
Oh, yes.

989
01:20:46,835 --> 01:20:47,961
Definitely.

990
01:20:49,630 --> 01:20:52,049
We'd better go
and uncover the gravestones.

991
01:21:31,711 --> 01:21:33,004
What's mummy doing?

992
01:21:33,463 --> 01:21:35,590
I've already told you.
She's gone mad.

993
01:21:35,924 --> 01:21:37,384
- Liar.
- She's gone mad.

994
01:21:37,634 --> 01:21:38,635
Liar, liar...

995
01:21:38,843 --> 01:21:40,512
She's gone mad.
She's gone mad! She's gone mad!

996
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:41,638
Liar! Liar! Liar!

997
01:21:47,352 --> 01:21:48,520
Night time.

998
01:21:50,689 --> 01:21:51,690
Where are you going?

999
01:21:51,981 --> 01:21:52,940
I've had enough.

1000
01:21:55,526 --> 01:21:57,027
I'm going to the woods
to look for daddy.

1001
01:21:57,236 --> 01:21:58,612
Are you going to run away?

1002
01:22:02,199 --> 01:22:04,618
If I hang on to the pipe,
I can climb down to the ground.

1003
01:22:05,411 --> 01:22:06,620
It's very easy.

1004
01:22:20,885 --> 01:22:23,344
If mummy finds out,
you're in for it.

1005
01:22:24,178 --> 01:22:25,388
Yes, yes, yes.

1006
01:22:35,481 --> 01:22:36,649
Anne, wait!

1007
01:22:37,859 --> 01:22:39,402
I want to come
and look for daddy too.

1008
01:22:39,819 --> 01:22:42,780
Liar, you just don't want
to be left on your own.

1009
01:22:43,031 --> 01:22:44,365
Scaredypants, scaredypants!

1010
01:22:44,616 --> 01:22:45,491
Be quiet!

1011
01:23:39,919 --> 01:23:41,879
Anne, I think we've got lost.

1012
01:23:42,129 --> 01:23:44,173
We still haven't left
the garden yet, silly.

1013
01:23:45,466 --> 01:23:48,052
- I'm scared.
- You shouldn't have come then.

1014
01:23:52,597 --> 01:23:55,183
- Say something.
- What shall I say?

1015
01:23:55,934 --> 01:23:57,727
I don't know. Anything.

1016
01:23:58,228 --> 01:24:00,689
Let's see.
My name's Anne and I'm walking.

1017
01:24:00,897 --> 01:24:02,857
I'm walking
and my name is Anne.

1018
01:24:30,384 --> 01:24:31,802
What's that over there?

1019
01:24:34,805 --> 01:24:35,806
I think they're graves.

1020
01:24:37,808 --> 01:24:38,893
Don't go near!

1021
01:24:39,268 --> 01:24:40,019
Why not?

1022
01:24:41,103 --> 01:24:42,813
What if a ghost jumps out?

1023
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:43,981
Graves don't have ghosts.

1024
01:24:44,189 --> 01:24:45,608
Only skeletons.

1025
01:25:03,208 --> 01:25:04,709
There's something written here.

1026
01:25:04,918 --> 01:25:05,919
Let's go.

1027
01:25:06,127 --> 01:25:07,003
Wait.

1028
01:25:30,984 --> 01:25:31,777
Anne.

1029
01:25:31,985 --> 01:25:33,362
What does it say?

1030
01:25:41,703 --> 01:25:43,789
You must be strong
now, children.

1031
01:25:44,039 --> 01:25:45,249
Nicholas, come here!

1032
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:49,378
Mrs. Mills, please don't
tell mummy we've run away.

1033
01:25:49,586 --> 01:25:50,628
Don't speak to them!

1034
01:25:52,088 --> 01:25:52,797
Why?

1035
01:25:53,047 --> 01:25:54,131
They're dead!

1036
01:25:54,632 --> 01:25:57,051
- What?
- They're ghosts. Please come here.

1037
01:25:57,927 --> 01:25:58,886
Children!

1038
01:25:59,929 --> 01:26:01,013
Nicholas!

1039
01:26:02,223 --> 01:26:07,061
Then why aren't they wearing sheets
and clanking chains? You said...

1040
01:26:07,311 --> 01:26:09,522
I don't care what I said!
Get away from them!

1041
01:26:10,147 --> 01:26:14,026
You're always teasing me and
telling lies, and I'm sick of it.

1042
01:26:14,235 --> 01:26:17,321
I'm not teasing you!
I'm telling the truth! Come here!

1043
01:26:20,699 --> 01:26:21,616
Quick!

1044
01:26:26,872 --> 01:26:27,789
Children!

1045
01:26:34,170 --> 01:26:34,963
Run!

1046
01:26:35,714 --> 01:26:36,381
Run!

1047
01:26:37,465 --> 01:26:39,467
Into the house.

1048
01:26:42,596 --> 01:26:43,972
Don't come any closer!

1049
01:26:44,973 --> 01:26:46,057
Don't move!

1050
01:26:52,354 --> 01:26:53,981
Don't trouble yourself, ma'am.

1051
01:26:54,398 --> 01:26:56,192
Tuberculosis finished us off

1052
01:26:56,942 --> 01:26:58,777
more than half a century ago.

1053
01:27:19,422 --> 01:27:20,340
Go away!

1054
01:27:27,096 --> 01:27:29,515
- Open the door, ma'am, please.
- What do you want?

1055
01:27:30,016 --> 01:27:31,142
Mummy, don't open

1056
01:27:31,392 --> 01:27:33,978
- the door, don't...
- We've seen their graves.

1057
01:27:35,104 --> 01:27:36,189
Go upstairs and hide.

1058
01:27:37,232 --> 01:27:39,067
- Go on!
- I'm scared.

1059
01:27:45,406 --> 01:27:46,491
Don't separate.

1060
01:27:51,662 --> 01:27:52,538
Anne.

1061
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:56,583
Whatever you do, don't separate.

1062
01:27:58,126 --> 01:28:00,754
Go hide. Go! Go!

1063
01:28:02,089 --> 01:28:04,383
We've been trying
to make you understand.

1064
01:28:07,678 --> 01:28:08,762
Understand what?

1065
01:28:08,971 --> 01:28:09,930
About the house.

1066
01:28:11,098 --> 01:28:12,975
About the new situation.

1067
01:28:13,934 --> 01:28:15,143
What situation?

1068
01:28:16,311 --> 01:28:20,815
We must all learn to live
together. The living and

1069
01:28:21,023 --> 01:28:21,941
the dead.

1070
01:28:23,067 --> 01:28:25,945
If you're dead,
leave us in peace.

1071
01:28:27,697 --> 01:28:29,115
Leave us in peace!

1072
01:28:30,241 --> 01:28:32,159
Leave us in peace!

1073
01:28:37,373 --> 01:28:39,333
In here. Get inside.

1074
01:28:45,965 --> 01:28:49,301
And suppose we do leave you,
do you think they will?

1075
01:28:50,385 --> 01:28:51,136
Who?

1076
01:28:51,636 --> 01:28:52,846
The intruders.

1077
01:28:54,431 --> 01:28:55,932
There are no intruders.

1078
01:28:56,141 --> 01:29:00,145
They took the curtains down,
oh yes, I assure you it was them.

1079
01:29:01,229 --> 01:29:03,690
And now they're
in there, with you

1080
01:29:04,274 --> 01:29:05,358
and the children.

1081
01:29:05,609 --> 01:29:06,526
Waiting for you!

1082
01:29:06,860 --> 01:29:08,153
- No!
- Yes!

1083
01:29:09,154 --> 01:29:11,990
And believe me,
sooner or later

1084
01:29:12,741 --> 01:29:13,950
they'll find you.

1085
01:29:15,118 --> 01:29:17,537
Listen, wait here
and I'll be back in a minute...

1086
01:29:17,621 --> 01:29:19,455
Mummy said
we shouldn't separate.

1087
01:29:19,663 --> 01:29:21,457
I can't leave her on her own.

1088
01:29:26,545 --> 01:29:28,005
Stop breathing like that.

1089
01:29:36,347 --> 01:29:38,390
Nicholas, stop
breathing like that.

1090
01:29:41,602 --> 01:29:42,603
Stop breathing!

1091
01:29:45,523 --> 01:29:46,690
Can't you hear it?

1092
01:29:47,441 --> 01:29:48,650
There's someone there.

1093
01:29:52,695 --> 01:29:54,822
Come with us, children.

1094
01:29:55,782 --> 01:29:57,909
Come with us.

1095
01:30:05,208 --> 01:30:06,167
Nicholas?

1096
01:30:08,962 --> 01:30:09,754
Anne?

1097
01:30:12,966 --> 01:30:13,925
Where are you?

1098
01:30:17,594 --> 01:30:18,845
Answer me!

1099
01:30:19,221 --> 01:30:22,766
- The intruders have found them.
- There's nothing we can do now.

1100
01:30:23,976 --> 01:30:25,686
You'll have to go upstairs

1101
01:30:26,311 --> 01:30:27,813
and talk to them.

1102
01:30:45,789 --> 01:30:48,457
Our Father, who art in heaven,

1103
01:30:49,041 --> 01:30:50,710
hallowed be Thy name,

1104
01:30:51,252 --> 01:30:54,714
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done on earth

1105
01:30:55,590 --> 01:30:56,757
as it is in heaven.

1106
01:30:58,301 --> 01:30:59,844
Give us this day our daily bread

1107
01:31:00,595 --> 01:31:02,054
and forgive us our trespasses.

1108
01:31:05,266 --> 01:31:07,852
Why are you crying, children?

1109
01:31:08,436 --> 01:31:11,772
Why don't you want
to be our friends?

1110
01:31:14,025 --> 01:31:16,736
Come on, speak to me.

1111
01:31:24,034 --> 01:31:26,703
Tell me what happened.

1112
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:31,291
Don't tell her!
Don't tell her!

1113
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:34,544
"Don't tell her."

1114
01:31:35,337 --> 01:31:36,421
If I tell her,

1115
01:31:37,297 --> 01:31:38,757
they'll leave us in peace.

1116
01:31:41,384 --> 01:31:42,344
Mummy!

1117
01:31:44,387 --> 01:31:45,305
"Mummy!"

1118
01:31:46,389 --> 01:31:48,349
Why are you crying, children?

1119
01:31:49,850 --> 01:31:51,977
What happened in this room?

1120
01:31:53,312 --> 01:31:55,648
What did your mother do to you?

1121
01:32:08,702 --> 01:32:09,995
Something about a pillow...

1122
01:32:11,038 --> 01:32:12,331
Is that how

1123
01:32:12,498 --> 01:32:13,499
she killed you?

1124
01:32:15,251 --> 01:32:16,417
With a pillow?

1125
01:32:16,918 --> 01:32:18,002
She didn't kill us.

1126
01:32:18,294 --> 01:32:19,629
Children, if you're dead,

1127
01:32:20,213 --> 01:32:22,632
why do you remain in this house?

1128
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:24,259
We're not dead!

1129
01:32:25,552 --> 01:32:28,054
Why do you remain in this house?

1130
01:32:28,304 --> 01:32:30,014
We're not dead!

1131
01:32:30,265 --> 01:32:31,599
We're not dead!

1132
01:32:31,808 --> 01:32:33,017
We're not dead!

1133
01:32:33,268 --> 01:32:35,937
Why do you remain in this house?

1134
01:32:37,272 --> 01:32:38,898
"We're not dead, we're not

1135
01:32:39,107 --> 01:32:39,941
dead."

1136
01:32:40,149 --> 01:32:41,067
We're not dead!

1137
01:32:41,276 --> 01:32:42,360
We're not dead!

1138
01:32:43,319 --> 01:32:44,112
We're not dead!

1139
01:32:45,697 --> 01:32:46,530
We're not dead!

1140
01:32:46,738 --> 01:32:47,364
We're not...

1141
01:32:48,824 --> 01:32:49,825
dead!

1142
01:33:04,131 --> 01:33:05,215
Are you all right?

1143
01:33:05,716 --> 01:33:06,508
Yes.

1144
01:33:07,676 --> 01:33:09,386
Just a bit dizzy, that's all.

1145
01:33:11,430 --> 01:33:12,347
What happened?

1146
01:33:13,724 --> 01:33:16,058
They made contact.

1147
01:33:16,767 --> 01:33:17,894
All three?

1148
01:33:18,477 --> 01:33:20,396
Apparently, yes.

1149
01:33:21,439 --> 01:33:23,274
The mother and
the two children.

1150
01:33:25,193 --> 01:33:26,944
Quite interesting,
don't you think?

1151
01:33:27,153 --> 01:33:28,154
Interesting?

1152
01:33:28,529 --> 01:33:29,697
I was scared out of my wits!

1153
01:33:30,615 --> 01:33:32,450
- Darling, calm down.
- No.

1154
01:33:32,825 --> 01:33:36,537
So far we have handled this matter
your way. But now you listen to me.

1155
01:33:36,913 --> 01:33:41,083
We can't possibly stay in this house
any longer. It's clear these beings

1156
01:33:41,292 --> 01:33:42,585
do not want us to live here.

1157
01:33:42,793 --> 01:33:44,921
- We don't know anything about them.
- Yes, we do.

1158
01:33:46,379 --> 01:33:50,425
The woman went mad, smothered
her children and then shot herself.

1159
01:33:51,259 --> 01:33:52,427
That's quite enough.

1160
01:33:52,928 --> 01:33:55,555
- Think of our son.
- There's nothing wrong with Victor.

1161
01:33:55,805 --> 01:33:56,681
Yes, there is!

1162
01:33:57,516 --> 01:34:01,102
He has nightmares, he says
he has seen that girl. And even

1163
01:34:01,311 --> 01:34:03,438
this lady has been possessed
by her. Please,

1164
01:34:03,647 --> 01:34:06,733
- let us leave this house.
- All right.

1165
01:34:08,193 --> 01:34:10,278
We will leave tomorrow morning.

1166
01:34:11,196 --> 01:34:12,447
Thank God for that.

1167
01:34:14,950 --> 01:34:16,700
I'll just go
and check on Victor.

1168
01:34:20,371 --> 01:34:23,332
- Once again, thank you so much.
- A pleasure.

1169
01:34:23,791 --> 01:34:26,502
- I hope we've been of some help.
- Oh, yes, of course.

1170
01:34:26,669 --> 01:34:29,839
But I admit that was not the most
pleasant evening of my life.

1171
01:34:31,757 --> 01:34:34,301
At first
I couldn't understand

1172
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:38,848
what the pillow
was doing in my hands.

1173
01:34:42,101 --> 01:34:43,853
And why you didn't move.

1174
01:34:48,982 --> 01:34:50,233
But then I knew.

1175
01:34:53,945 --> 01:34:55,113
It had happened.

1176
01:34:59,701 --> 01:35:01,619
I'd killed my children.

1177
01:35:08,543 --> 01:35:09,878
I got the rifle,

1178
01:35:12,547 --> 01:35:14,215
I put it to my forehead...

1179
01:35:19,052 --> 01:35:20,554
and I pulled the trigger.

1180
01:35:25,684 --> 01:35:26,643
Nothing...

1181
01:35:34,359 --> 01:35:37,237
And then I heard
your laughter in the bedroom.

1182
01:35:41,909 --> 01:35:45,328
You were playing with the pillows,
as if nothing had happened.

1183
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:49,165
And I thought...

1184
01:35:51,334 --> 01:35:54,003
the Lord,
in His great mercy,

1185
01:35:54,921 --> 01:35:56,130
was giving me

1186
01:35:57,757 --> 01:35:58,966
another chance,

1187
01:36:00,635 --> 01:36:01,594
telling me,

1188
01:36:03,554 --> 01:36:04,555
"Don't give up,

1189
01:36:08,267 --> 01:36:09,435
be strong.

1190
01:36:11,896 --> 01:36:13,189
Be a good mother

1191
01:36:15,815 --> 01:36:16,816
for them."

1192
01:36:21,404 --> 01:36:22,364
But now...

1193
01:36:26,576 --> 01:36:27,494
Now...

1194
01:36:31,414 --> 01:36:33,208
What does all this mean?

1195
01:36:37,921 --> 01:36:38,964
Where are we?

1196
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:43,552
Young Lydia asked
the very same thing

1197
01:36:44,301 --> 01:36:47,221
when she realised
the three of us were dead.

1198
01:36:48,305 --> 01:36:51,517
And that was the last time
she ever spoke.

1199
01:36:54,228 --> 01:36:56,522
But I couldn't
tell you that before now.

1200
01:37:01,235 --> 01:37:03,696
Shall I make
a nice cup of tea, ma'am?

1201
01:37:08,993 --> 01:37:12,454
The intruders are leaving,
but others will come.

1202
01:37:13,414 --> 01:37:17,709
Now, sometimes we'll sense them
and other times we won't.

1203
01:37:19,544 --> 01:37:21,629
But that's the way
it's always been...

1204
01:37:24,340 --> 01:37:25,550
Ma'am.

1205
01:37:29,846 --> 01:37:30,930
Mummy...

1206
01:37:32,473 --> 01:37:34,809
daddy died
in the war, didn't he?

1207
01:37:35,226 --> 01:37:38,146
- Yes.
- Will we ever see him again?

1208
01:37:39,189 --> 01:37:40,273
I don't know.

1209
01:37:42,317 --> 01:37:43,401
If we're dead,

1210
01:37:44,401 --> 01:37:45,819
where's Limbo?

1211
01:37:50,115 --> 01:37:52,743
I don't know
if there is a Limbo.

1212
01:37:55,787 --> 01:37:57,539
I'm no wiser than you are.

1213
01:38:00,959 --> 01:38:02,920
But I do know
that I love you.

1214
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,840
I've always loved you.

1215
01:38:10,928 --> 01:38:12,804
And the house is ours.

1216
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:16,307
You say with me.

1217
01:38:18,059 --> 01:38:20,436
- This house is ours...
- This house is ours...

1218
01:38:20,686 --> 01:38:23,022
- This house is ours.
- This house is ours.

1219
01:38:23,231 --> 01:38:26,025
- This house is ours.
- This house is ours.

1220
01:38:43,583 --> 01:38:46,962
Mummy, look.
It doesn't hurt any more.

1221
01:38:58,390 --> 01:39:00,851
No one can make us
leave this house.

1222
01:39:27,668 --> 01:39:28,836
Come along, Victor.
