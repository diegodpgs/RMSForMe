1
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,881
This is Agent Leland Turbo.

2
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,966
I have a flash transmission
for Agent Finn McMissile.

3
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,971
Finn, my cover's been compromised.
Everything's gone pear-shaped.

4
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,017
You won't believe what I found out here.

5
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:04,396
This is bigger than anything we've ever
seen, and no one even knows it exists.

6
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:08,442
Finn, I need backup, but don't call
the cavalry, it could blow the operation.

7
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,028
- And be careful. It's not safe out here.
- Let's go.

8
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,614
Transmitting my grids now. Good luck.

9
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,316
All right, buddy, we're here.

10
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,401
Right where you paid me to bring you.

11
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,529
Question is, why?

12
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,073
I'm looking for a car.

13
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,825
A car? Ha!

14
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:01,328
Hey, pal, you can't get any further away
from land than out here.

15
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:03,080
Exactly where I want to be.

16
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:07,042
I got news for you, buddy.
There's nobody out here but us.

17
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,629
What are you doing out here?

18
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,340
What does it look like, genius?
I'm crabbing.

19
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:17,344
Well, turn around
and go back where you came from.

20
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,388
Yeah, and who's gonna make me?

21
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:23,517
All right. All right.
Don't get your prop in a twist.

22
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:28,438
What a jerk. Sorry, buddy.
Looks like it's the end of the line.

23
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,357
Buddy?

24
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,256
- Incoming.
- All workers report to the loading dock.

25
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,719
Leland Turbo, this is Finn McMissile.
I'm at the rally point. Over.

26
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,473
All right, fellas, you know the drill.

27
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,184
Leland, it's Finn. Please respond. Over.

28
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,357
Come on, guys. These crates
aren't gonna unload themselves.

29
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:57,402
Too many cars here. Out of my way.

30
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,738
Professor Zundapp?

31
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,532
Here it is, Professor. You wanted to
see this before we load it?

32
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,743
Ah, yes. Very carefully.

33
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,120
Oh, a TV camera.

34
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,666
- What does it actually do?
- This camera is extremely dangerous.

35
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,668
What are you up to now, Professor?

36
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:29,351
This is valuable equipment. Make sure
it is properly secured for the voyage.

37
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,353
- You got it.
- Hey, Professor Z!

38
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,981
This is one of those
British spies we told you about.

39
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:38,110
Yeah! This one we caught sticking
his bumper where it didn't belong.

40
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,487
Agent Leland Turbo.

41
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,162
It's Finn McMissile!

42
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,207
He's seen the camera! Kill him!

43
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,460
- All hands on deck!
- All hands on deck!

44
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,150
Whoa!

45
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,073
Waargh!

46
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,375
What?

47
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,724
Get to the boats!

48
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,210
- He's getting away!
- Not for long!

49
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,789
He's dead, Professor.

50
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,541
Wunderbar!

51
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,378
With Finn McMissile gone,
who can stop us now?

52
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:48,633
Mater -Tow Mater, that's who -
is here to help you.

53
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,180
- Hey, Otis!
- Hey, Mater.

54
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,058
I... Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry.

55
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,394
I thought I could make it this time, but...

56
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,858
Smooth like pudding, huh?

57
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:08,403
- Who am I kidding?
- I'll always be a lemon.

58
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:12,073
Well, dad-gum, you're leaking oil again.
Must be your gaskets.

59
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,617
Hey, but look on the bright side.

60
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:17,037
This is your tenth tow this month,
so it's on the house.

61
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:20,582
You're the only one
that's nice to lemons like me, Mater.

62
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:24,002
Don't sweat it. Shoot,
these things happen to everybody.

63
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:27,422
- But you never leak oil.
- Yeah, but I ain't perfect.

64
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:30,884
Don't tell nobody, but I think my rust
is starting to show through.

65
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,678
Hey. Is Lightning McQueen back yet?

66
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,971
Not yet.

67
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:38,642
He must be crazy excited
about winning his fourth Piston Cup.

68
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,060
Four! Wow!

69
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,813
Yeah, we're so dad-gum proud of him,
but I wish he'd hurry up and get back,

70
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,192
'cause we got a whole summer's worth
of best friend fun to make up for.

71
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,526
Just me and...

72
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,112
McQueen!

73
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,490
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- McQueen!

74
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:57,160
- Mater! I'm in no hurry!
- Hey, everybody. McQueen's back!

75
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,120
- Aaah!
- McQueen's back!

76
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:03,166
- McQueen's back! McQueen's back!
- Aaah! Oooh-hoo! Oooh-hah!

77
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,876
McQueen's back!

78
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,629
Oh, Lightning! Welcome home!

79
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:11,257
- Good to have you back, honey!
- Congratulations, man.

80
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,634
Welcome home, soldier.

81
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,053
The place wasn't the same without you,
son.

82
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,722
What? Did he go somewhere?

83
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:21,309
It's good to be home, everybody.

84
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,312
- Mater!
- McQueen!

85
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,022
Oooh!

86
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,818
Whoooa!

87
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,821
Hey,
how far did you make it this time, Otis?

88
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:36,825
- Halfway to the county line.
- Ooh, not bad, man!

89
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,535
I know! I can't believe it either!

90
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:42,497
- McQueen! Welcome back!
- Mater, it's so good to see you.

91
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:43,832
You too, buddy.

92
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,460
Oh, man, you ain't going to believe
the things I got planned for us!

93
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,380
These best friend greetings
get longer every year!

94
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:55,343
- You ready to have some serious fun?
- I've got something to show you first.

95
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,721
Wow.

96
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,223
I can't believe
they renamed the Piston Cup

97
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:03,476
after our very own Doc Hudson.

98
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,937
I know Doc said these things
were just old cups,

99
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:10,233
but to have someone else win it
just didn't feel right, you know?

100
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:17,240
Doc would've been real proud of you.
That's for sure.

101
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:23,496
All right, pal.
I've been waiting all summer for this.

102
00:10:23,622 --> 00:10:26,791
- What you got planned?
- Ho-ho-ho! You sure you can handle it?

103
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,336
Do you know who you're talking to?
This is Lightning McQueen!

104
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,422
I can handle anything.

105
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,257
Er... Mater?

106
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,594
Just remember, your brakes
ain't going to work on these!

107
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,596
- Mater?
- Relax.

108
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,265
These train tracks
ain't been used in years!

109
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,434
Aaaah!

110
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,603
- Aaaah!
- Faster, faster. Come on. Here we go!

111
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,146
Faster!

112
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,610
Ooh. Wow.

113
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:57,155
Yeah, I don't know. Do you think?

114
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,282
This is going to be good!

115
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,668
Did you see that?

116
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,923
Uh-oh.
- This ain't going to be good.

117
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,720
Ha-ha! Boy, this was the best day ever!

118
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:24,140
And my favorite souvenir,
this new dent.

119
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:27,852
- Boy, Mater, today was ah...
- Shoot, that was nothing.

120
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,146
Wait till you see
what I got planned for tonight!

121
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:34,609
Mater, Mater, whoa!
I was thinking of just a quiet dinner.

122
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:38,029
That's exactly what I was thinkin'.

123
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,533
- No, I meant with Sally, Mater.
- Even better!

124
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:45,036
You, me and Miss Sally
goin' out for supper.

125
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,330
Mater, I meant it would be
just me and Sally.

126
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,626
- Oh.
- You know, just for tonight.

127
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,712
- Oh...
- We'll do whatever you want tomorrow.

128
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,756
OK.

129
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,300
- Thanks for understanding.
- Yeah, sure.

130
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:03,346
- Y'all go on and have fun now.
- All right, then.

131
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,598
See you soon, amigo.

132
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,648
Ah, this is so nice.

133
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,693
I can't tell you how good it is
to be here alone,

134
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,611
just the two of us, finally.

135
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,114
- You and me.
- Ahem! Good evening.

136
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,074
- Oh!
- My name is Mater,

137
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,701
and I'll be your waiter.

138
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,453
Mater the waiter.
That's funny right there.

139
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,581
Mater? You work here?

140
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,541
Yeah, I work here. What'd you think?

141
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,376
I snuck in here
when nobody was lookin'

142
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,087
and pretended to be your waiter
so I could hang out with you?

143
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:40,008
Oh, yeah.
How ridiculous would that be?

144
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,261
Can I start you two lovebirds off
with a couple of drinks?

145
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:47,515
- Yes. I'll have my usual.
- You know what? I'll have that, too.

146
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,477
Uh... Right. Your usual.

147
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,696
- Thanks, man.
- Grazie, Guido.

148
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,323
Guido, what's McQueen's usual?

149
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,657
How should I know?

150
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,785
- Perfect. Give me two of them.
- Quiet! My program's on.

151
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,121
Tonight on the Mel Dorado Show...

152
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,040
His story gripped the world.

153
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,459
Oil billionaire Miles Axlerod,

154
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:18,421
in an attempt to become the first car to
circumnavigate the globe without GPS,

155
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,841
ironically ran out of gas,
and found himself trapped in the wild.

156
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,761
Feared dead,
he emerged 36 days later,

157
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:28,514
running on a fuel he distilled himself
from the natural elements!

158
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,600
Since then, he's sold his oil fortune,

159
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,645
converted himself from a gas-guzzler
into an electric car

160
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,898
and has devoted his life to finding
a renewable, clean-burning fuel.

161
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,442
Now he claims to have done it
with his allinol.

162
00:13:39,526 --> 00:13:42,070
And to show the world
what his new super fuel can do

163
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,447
he's created a racing competition
like no other,

164
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,449
inviting the greatest champions

165
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,576
to battle in the first ever
World Grand Prix.

166
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,745
Welcome, Sir Miles Axlerod.

167
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,915
Thank you, Mel. It is good to be here.
Listen to me.

168
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,210
Big oil. It costs a fortune.
Pollution is getting worse.

169
00:13:57,294 --> 00:14:01,673
I mean, it's a fossil fuel.
"Fossil," as in dead dinosaurs.

170
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,633
And we all know
what happened to them.

171
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:06,469
Alternative energy is the future.
Trust me, Mel.

172
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:09,514
After seeing allinol in action
at the World Grand Prix,

173
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:13,643
nobody will ever go back
to gasoline again.

174
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,436
What happened to the dinosaurs, now?

175
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,355
And on satellite,
a World Grand Prix competitor

176
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,650
and one of the fastest cars in the world,
Francesco Bernoulli.

177
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:24,195
It is an honor, Signore Dorado,
for you.

178
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:26,030
Why not invite Lightning McQueen?

179
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,657
Of course we invited him,

180
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,159
but apparently after his very long
racing season

181
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,245
he is taking time off to rest.

182
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,790
The Lightning McQueen would not
have a chance against Francesco.

183
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:39,043
I can go over 300 kilometers an hour.

184
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:44,007
In miles, that is like...
way faster than McQueen.

185
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,051
Let's go to the phones.
Baltimore, Maryland, you're on the air.

186
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,387
- Am I on? Hello?
- You're on. Go ahead.

187
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,805
- Hello?
- Go ahead.

188
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,475
Let's go to Radiator Springs.
You're on, caller.

189
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,311
That Italian feller
you got on there

190
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,938
can't talk that way about
Lightning McQueen.

191
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:02,525
He's the bestest race car
in the whole wide world.

192
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,403
- Uh-oh.
- If he is, how you say,

193
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,406
"the bestest race car,"
then why must he rest? Huh?

194
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,074
'Cause he knows
what's important.

195
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,745
Every now and then he prefers
just to slow down, enjoy life.

196
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,956
Oh! You heard it!
Lightning McQueen prefers to be slow!

197
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,791
This is not news to Francesco.

198
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,169
When I want to go to sleep,
I watch one of his races.

199
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,879
After two laps, I am out cold.

200
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,173
That ain't what I meant.

201
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,509
What's going on
over there?

202
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,220
He is afraid of Francesco.

203
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,598
That's that
Italian formula car.

204
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:37,018
- His name is...
- Francesco Bernoulli.

205
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,479
- No wonder there's a crowd.
- Why do you know his name?

206
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:42,398
And don't say it like that.
It's three syllables, not ten.

207
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,943
What? He's nice to look at.
You know, open-wheeled and all.

208
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,613
What's wrong with fenders?
I thought you liked my fenders.

209
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:51,491
- Let me tell you something else.
- Mater?

210
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,452
McQueen could drive circles
around you.

211
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,537
Driving in circles is all he can-a do,
no?

212
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,622
No.

213
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:01,375
I mean, yes.
I mean, he could beat you anywhere.

214
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,627
Any time, any track.

215
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,629
Mel, can we move on?

216
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,589
Francesco needs a caller
who can provide

217
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:09,884
a little more intellectual stimulation,
like a dump truck.

218
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:13,304
Ha-ha! That shows what you know.
Dump trucks is dumb.

219
00:16:13,388 --> 00:16:15,598
Hey! Whoa!

220
00:16:16,099 --> 00:16:17,767
Yeah, hi. This is Lightning McQueen.

221
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,811
The Lightning McQueen, huh?

222
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:23,314
I don't appreciate my best friend
being insulted like that.

223
00:16:23,398 --> 00:16:25,942
McQueen, that was your best friend?
Oh!

224
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,319
This is the difference
between you and Francesco.

225
00:16:28,403 --> 00:16:30,655
Francesco knows how good he is.

226
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:34,075
He does not need to surround himself
with tow trucks to prove it.

227
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,954
Those are strong words
from a car that is so fragile.

228
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:42,083
Fragile! He calls Francesco fragile!

229
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,543
Not-a so fast, McQueen!

230
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,837
"Not so fast. "
Is that your new motto?

231
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:49,924
Motto?

232
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:53,886
This sounds like something that needs
to be settled on the race course.

233
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:58,099
What do you say, Lightning McQueen?
We've got room for one more racer.

234
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:01,435
I would love to,
but my crew is off for the season, so...

235
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,522
Pit stop.

236
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,941
You know what? They just got back.

237
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:08,568
Deal me in, baby.

238
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:11,654
Ka-chow! Yeah.

239
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,701
I know, I know.
I just got back, but we won't be long.

240
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,495
No, don't worry about me.
I've got enough to do here.

241
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,455
Mater's going to have a blast, though.

242
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,291
You're bringing Mater, right?

243
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,793
You never bring him
to any of your races.

244
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,466
Ah.

245
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,927
Just let him sit in the pits.
Give him a headset.

246
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,305
Come on, it will be
the thrill of a lifetime for him.

247
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,390
- Your drink, sir.
- Mater.

248
00:17:39,474 --> 00:17:40,850
I didn't taste it!

249
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,686
How'd you like to come
and see the world with me?

250
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,647
- You mean it?
- Yeah. You got me into this thing.

251
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,608
- You're coming along.
- All right!

252
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,119
Ka-chow!

253
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,121
Ha-ha!

254
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,904
Hey!

255
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,123
Hey, excuse me!

256
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,208
Domo arigato!

257
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,090
Yeah!

258
00:20:01,616 --> 00:20:05,119
Guido, look. Ferraris and tires.

259
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:08,205
- Let's go!
- Ho-ho! Look at this.

260
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,500
OK, now, Mater, remember,
best behavior.

261
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:14,128
- You got it, buddy. Hey, what's that?
- Mater!

262
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:15,379
Hey, McQueen! Over here.

263
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,465
- Lewis!
- Hey, man.

264
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,216
- Jeff!
- Hey, Lightning.

265
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,968
Can you believe this party?

266
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,391
Hey.

267
00:20:28,643 --> 00:20:30,853
You done good. You got all the leaves.

268
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:34,482
- Check out that tow truck.
- Man, I wonder who that guy's with.

269
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,818
Ah... Will you guys excuse me
just for one little second?

270
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,237
Ho-ho! Good job!

271
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,908
Mater!
Listen, this isn't Radiator Springs.

272
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,409
You're just realizing that?

273
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,746
Oh-ho! That jet lag really done
a number on you.

274
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,499
Mater, things are different over here.

275
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,628
Which means maybe you should,
you know, act a little different, too.

276
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:58,506
- Different than what?
- Well, just help me out here.

277
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:01,217
You need help? Shoot!
Why didn't you say so?

278
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,177
That's what a tow truck does.

279
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:04,887
- Yeah, I mean...
- Looky there.

280
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,681
It's Mr. San Francisco.
I'll introduce you.

281
00:21:07,807 --> 00:21:10,434
- Mater, no!
- Look at me. I'm helping you already.

282
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,229
Hey, Mr. San Francisco,
I'd like you to meet...

283
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,439
Ah, Lightning McQueen! Buona sera.

284
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:18,359
- Nice to meet you, Francesco.
- Nice to meet you, too.

285
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:21,278
You are very good-looking.
Not as good as I thought, but good.

286
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,239
Excuse me.
Can I get a picture with you?

287
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,074
Anything for McQueen's friend.

288
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:28,494
Miss Sally is going to flip
when she sees this.

289
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,622
She's Lightning McQueen's girlfriend.

290
00:21:31,706 --> 00:21:33,832
- Oooh!
- She's a big fan of yours.

291
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,793
Hey, she has-a good taste.

292
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:39,296
Mater's prone to exaggeration.
I wouldn't say she's a "big fan".

293
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,715
You're right. She's a huge fan!

294
00:21:41,841 --> 00:21:44,635
She goes on and on
about your open wheels.

295
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:48,013
Mentioning it once doesn't qualify
as going on and on.

296
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:51,684
Francesco is familiar
with this reaction to Francesco.

297
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,852
Women respect a car
that has-a nothing to hide.

298
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,479
Yeah, er...

299
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,147
- Let us have a toast.
- Let's.

300
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:00,192
I dedicate my win tomorrow
to Miss Sally.

301
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,318
Oh. Sorry.

302
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,572
I already dedicated
my win tomorrow to her.

303
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,074
So, if we both do it,
it's really not so special.

304
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:10,578
- Besides, I don't have a drink.
- I'll go get you one.

305
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,122
Do you mind if I borrow a few bucks
for one of them drinks?

306
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:16,584
- They're free.
- Free? Shoot, what am I doing here?

307
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,713
I should probably go keep an eye
on him. See you at the race.

308
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:24,717
Yes, you will see Francesco,
but not like this.

309
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:28,470
You will see him like-a this
as he drives away from you.

310
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,097
Ha! That's cute.

311
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:32,474
You had one of those made up
for all the racers?

312
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:33,726
No.

313
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,144
Okay.

314
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:38,731
- Ciao, McQueen!
- He is so getting beat tomorrow!

315
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:43,444
Ladies and gentlecars,
Sir Miles Axlerod.

316
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:47,239
It is my absolute honor
to introduce to you

317
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:51,327
the competitors in the first ever
World Grand Prix.

318
00:22:51,786 --> 00:22:54,204
From Brazil, Number 8...

319
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,977
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

320
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,646
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia
has no radiator.

321
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,440
That's because it's air-cooled.

322
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:25,277
Great. I'm Agent Shiftwell.
Holley Shiftwell from the Tokyo station.

323
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,404
- I have a message from London.
- Not here.

324
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,406
Try the canapes on the mezzanine.

325
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:37,081
The lab boys analyzed the photo I sent?
What did they learn about the camera?

326
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:39,333
It appears to be
a standard television camera.

327
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:42,586
They said if you could get closer
photos next time that would be great.

328
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,962
This was London's message?

329
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,298
Oh, no. No, sir.

330
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,050
The oil platforms you were on,

331
00:23:48,134 --> 00:23:51,095
turns out they're sitting on
the biggest oil reserve in the world.

332
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,429
How did we miss that?

333
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,515
They've scrambled
everyone's satellites.

334
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,767
The Americans discovered it
just before you did.

335
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,770
They placed an agent on that platform
under deep cover.

336
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:03,065
He was able to get a photo of the car
who's running the entire operation.

337
00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:04,149
Great.

338
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,610
Who is it?
Has anyone seen the photo yet?

339
00:24:06,694 --> 00:24:08,112
Nope, not yet.

340
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,906
The American is here tonight
to pass it to you.

341
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,533
He'll signal you when he's ready.

342
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,201
Good, good.

343
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,370
Oh, no.

344
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,124
- What is it?
- Change of plan.

345
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,126
- You're meeting the American.
- What? Me?

346
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,461
Those thugs down there
were on the oil platform.

347
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,547
If they see me,
the mission is compromised.

348
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:31,718
No, I'm technical. I'm in diagnostics.
I'm... I'm not a field agent.

349
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:32,845
You are now.

350
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,851
I'll take one of them. Thank you.

351
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,520
Never know which one McQueen
will have a hankering for.

352
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:48,485
Hey. What you got here that's free?
How about that pistachio ice cream?

353
00:24:49,737 --> 00:24:52,156
- No, no, wasabi.
- Same old same old.

354
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,950
What's up with you?
That looks delicious!

355
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,040
Er... little more, please.
It is free, right?

356
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,251
Keep it coming. A little more.

357
00:25:04,335 --> 00:25:06,003
Come on, let's go. It's free.

358
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,921
You're gettin' there. Scoop, scoop.

359
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,632
There ya go!
Now that's a scoop of ice cream!

360
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,760
My condolences.

361
00:25:13,928 --> 00:25:16,805
And now our last competitor.

362
00:25:16,931 --> 00:25:20,517
Number 95, Lightning McQueen!

363
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,852
Ka-chow!

364
00:25:21,936 --> 00:25:24,605
Thank you so much for having us,
Sir Axlerod.

365
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:28,150
I really look forward to racing.
This is a great opportunity.

366
00:25:28,234 --> 00:25:30,611
Oh, the pleasure is all ours, Lightning.

367
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:33,822
You and your team bring
excellence and professionalism

368
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,032
to this competition.

369
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,205
Somebody get me water! Aah!

370
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,624
Oh, sweet relief. Sweet relief.

371
00:25:51,257 --> 00:25:57,137
Whatever you do,
do not eat the free pistachio ice cream.

372
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,556
It has turned.

373
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,892
Sir Axlerod, I can explain.

374
00:26:01,976 --> 00:26:04,728
- This is Mater. He's...
- I know him.

375
00:26:04,812 --> 00:26:07,397
This is the bloke that called in
to the television show.

376
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:10,192
- You're the one I have to thank.
- No, thank you.

377
00:26:10,276 --> 00:26:11,902
This trip's been amazin'.

378
00:26:11,986 --> 00:26:14,404
Ah. He's a little excited, isn't he?

379
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:17,866
- Mater!
- But wait, I... Oh, shoot.

380
00:26:17,992 --> 00:26:20,202
- Mater.
- Has anyone got a towel?

381
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,829
Mater, get a hold of yourself.
You're making a scene!

382
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:27,376
- But I never leak oil. Never.
- Go take care of yourself right now!

383
00:26:31,005 --> 00:26:34,341
Comin' through! Leakin' oil.
Where's the bathroom? Thank you.

384
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,427
I gotta go. Oh, er...

385
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,223
Er...

386
00:26:41,307 --> 00:26:43,308
Sorry, ladies.

387
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:46,270
I'm leakin'. I never leak. I never leak.

388
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:49,106
I never leak, I never leak, I never leak.

389
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,025
Oh, oh, I never leak. Oooh!

390
00:26:52,151 --> 00:26:54,152
I never leak, I never leak, never...

391
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:56,196
Wow-wee!

392
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,912
What in the...?

393
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,424
Hey, that tickles!

394
00:27:19,762 --> 00:27:21,346
Waaargh!

395
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:32,774
Okay, McMissile. I'm here.
It's time for the drop.

396
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:39,906
OK, so, the American has activated
his tracking beacon.

397
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,575
Roger that. Move in.

398
00:27:56,215 --> 00:27:57,299
Stop! Hey!

399
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,236
- Oh, you've got to be joking.
- What's the problem?

400
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,113
- He's in the loo.
- So, go in!

401
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:22,908
- I can't go into the men's loo!
- Time is of the essence.

402
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,993
All right.

403
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:36,421
Oh! Whatever you do,
I would not go in there!

404
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:40,592
Hey! A Gremlin and a Pacer!

405
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,260
No offense to your makes and models,

406
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:45,055
but you break down harder
than my cousin Betsy

407
00:28:45,139 --> 00:28:47,015
after she got left at the altar!

408
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,351
What the...? Whoa. Are you OK?

409
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,520
- I'm fine.
- Hey! Tow truck!

410
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:55,065
We'd like to get to our private business
here, if you don't mind.

411
00:28:55,149 --> 00:28:56,650
Oh, yeah, sorry.

412
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:59,236
Don't let me get in the way
of your private business.

413
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,073
Oh, a little advice. When you hear
a giggle and see that waterfall,

414
00:29:03,157 --> 00:29:05,075
you best press that green button.

415
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:07,285
- Thank you.
- It's to adjust the temperature.

416
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,996
- Got it.
- And it's in Celsius, not Fahrenheit.

417
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,498
Get out of here!

418
00:29:11,582 --> 00:29:15,669
All right, then. And when she starts
gigglin', prepare to be squirted.

419
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,422
'Scuse me, ma'am.

420
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,424
Dad-gum pistachio ice cream.

421
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:24,177
- This cannot be him.
- Is he American?

422
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,596
Look out, ladies.
Mater's fittin' to get funky.

423
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:29,057
- Extremely.
- Then it's him.

424
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,184
- Hello.
- Well, hello.

425
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,937
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia
has no radiator.

426
00:29:34,021 --> 00:29:36,606
Well, of course it doesn't.
That's 'cause it's air-cooled.

427
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,443
Perfect.
Erm... I'm from the Tokyo Station.

428
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:42,237
'Course, Karmann Ghias
weren't the only ones.

429
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:46,116
Besides the Beetles, you had Type 3
Squarebacks with the Pancake motors.

430
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,535
- Yeah, OK. I get it.
- And before both of them

431
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:50,328
there's the Type 2 buses.

432
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,581
- My buddy Fillmore's one of them.
- Listen!

433
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,416
Erm... We should find somewhere
more private.

434
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,294
Gee, don't you think that's a little...?

435
00:29:57,378 --> 00:30:00,422
You're right. Impossible to know
which areas here are compromised.

436
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,716
- So, when can I see you again?
- Well, let's see.

437
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,594
- Tomorrow I'll be out there at the races.
- Got it.

438
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,137
We'll rendezvous then.

439
00:30:08,222 --> 00:30:11,057
- There you are. Where have you been?
- What's a "rendezvous"?

440
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,934
- Er... It's like a date.
- A date?

441
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,436
Mater, what's going on?

442
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:17,314
What's going on is
I got me a date tomorrow.

443
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,316
Guido don't believe you.

444
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,444
Believe it.
My new girlfriend just said so.

445
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,530
Hey, there she is. Hey! Hey, lady!

446
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,491
See you tomorrow!

447
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,910
Guido still don't believe you.

448
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:36,041
- I got to admit, you tricked us real good.
- And we don't like being tricked.

449
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,001
What's so funny?

450
00:30:38,085 --> 00:30:42,214
Well, I was just wearing a disguise.
You guys are stuck looking like that.

451
00:30:44,675 --> 00:30:48,261
Allinol? Thanks, fellas.
I hear this stuff is good for you.

452
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,138
So you think.

453
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,766
Allinol by itself is good for you.

454
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,189
But after microscopic examination

455
00:30:59,273 --> 00:31:01,942
I have found
that it has one small weakness.

456
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,861
When hit with
an electromagnetic pulse,

457
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,948
it becomes extremely dangerous.

458
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,866
Smile for the camera.

459
00:31:09,992 --> 00:31:11,993
Is that all you want? I got a whole act.

460
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:15,622
You were very interested in this camera
on the oil platform.

461
00:31:15,706 --> 00:31:19,668
Now, you will witness
what it really does.

462
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:23,380
- Whatever you say, Professor.
- You talked up a lot of cars last night.

463
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,715
- Which one's your associate?
- Your mother.

464
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,386
Oh, no, I'm sorry, it was your sister.
I can't tell them apart these days.

465
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,221
Could I start it now, Professor Z?

466
00:31:31,305 --> 00:31:33,390
Go 50% power.

467
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,312
This camera is actually
an electromagnetic pulse emitter.

468
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,314
What about her? Did you give it to her?

469
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,693
The allinol is now heating to a boil,

470
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:49,698
dramatically expanding, causing the
engine block to crack under the stress,

471
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:52,242
forcing oil
into the combustion chamber.

472
00:31:52,326 --> 00:31:54,244
How about him? Did you talk to him?

473
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,914
What do I care?
I can replace an engine block.

474
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,334
You may be able to,
but after full impact of the pulse...

475
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,921
unfortunately...
there will be nothing to replace.

476
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:08,049
- How about him?
- Does he have it?

477
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,097
That's him. He's the one.

478
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,433
- Roger that, Professor Z.
- No!

479
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,559
Yes, sir.

480
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:21,563
We believe the infiltrator has passed
along sensitive information.

481
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,858
I will take care of it
before any damage can be done.

482
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,861
The project is still on schedule.

483
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:31,531
You will find the second agent
and kill him.

484
00:32:42,209 --> 00:32:45,253
Japan, land of the rising sun,

485
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,881
where ancient tradition
meets modern technology.

486
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:51,551
Welcome to the inaugural running
of the World Grand Prix.

487
00:32:51,677 --> 00:32:53,929
I'm Brent Mustangburger
with racing legends

488
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,139
Darrell Cartrip and David Hobbscap.

489
00:32:56,223 --> 00:32:58,516
There's never been a competition
like this before.

490
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:01,144
First, allinol, making its debut tonight

491
00:33:01,228 --> 00:33:04,272
as the required fuel
for all these great champions.

492
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,274
Second, the course itself.

493
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,401
And it's like nothing
we've ever seen before.

494
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,237
David, how exactly
does this competition work?

495
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:15,575
All three of these street courses are
classic round-the-house racetracks.

496
00:33:15,701 --> 00:33:17,577
This means that the IMP
and formula cars

497
00:33:17,703 --> 00:33:20,121
should break out of the gate
in spectacular fashion.

498
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,999
Look for Francesco Bernoulli,
in particular, to lead early.

499
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:26,086
And with technical turns throughout,
GT and touring cars,

500
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,588
like Spain's Miguel Camino,
should make up ground

501
00:33:28,714 --> 00:33:30,674
but I doubt it'll be enough
to stop Francesco

502
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:33,593
from absolutely running away with it.

503
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:35,261
Whoa now. Hold your horsepower.

504
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,180
You forget the most important factor...

505
00:33:37,264 --> 00:33:39,182
that early dirt track section
of the course.

506
00:33:39,266 --> 00:33:42,227
The dirt is supposed to be
the equalizer in this race.

507
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:44,521
French rally car
Raoul CaRoule

508
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,690
is counting on a big boost
through there.

509
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,733
And don't forget
Lightning McQueen.

510
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,443
His mentor, the Hudson Hornet,

511
00:33:50,569 --> 00:33:53,196
was one of the greatest
dirt track racers of all time.

512
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,992
In my opinion, McQueen is the best
all-around racer in this competition.

513
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,452
Really, Darrell, you need
to clean your windshield.

514
00:33:59,578 --> 00:34:03,206
You're clearly not seeing this
Francesco's race to lose.

515
00:34:03,457 --> 00:34:06,584
- It's time to find out.
- The racers are locking into the grid.

516
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:17,470
Speed. I am speed.

517
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:20,348
Really? You are speed?

518
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:23,393
Then Francesco is triple speed.

519
00:34:23,477 --> 00:34:27,188
Francesco is triple speed.

520
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,941
Ho-ho! Francesco likes-a this McQueen.

521
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,944
It's-a really getting him into the zone.

522
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,989
He is so getting beat today.

523
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,605
- Your suspension sets look good.
- Tire pressure is excellent!

524
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:11,524
- He's got plenty of fuel.
- And he's awesome.

525
00:35:20,117 --> 00:35:23,620
- Why is he in the pits? He's so exposed.
- It's his cover.

526
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,748
One of the best I've seen, too.
Look at the detail on that rust.

527
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,249
It must have cost him a fortune.

528
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:31,461
- But why hasn't he contacted us yet?
- There's probably heat on him.

529
00:35:31,545 --> 00:35:33,463
- Be patient.
- Right, of course.

530
00:35:33,547 --> 00:35:36,716
- He'll signal us when he can.
- Then we find out who's behind all this.

531
00:35:36,842 --> 00:35:41,304
As they head into the palace
hairpin, Francesco builds an early lead.

532
00:35:41,388 --> 00:35:43,890
- Hang on, boys.
- Here comes the dirt.

533
00:35:43,974 --> 00:35:45,558
Slipping and sliding, baby.

534
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,894
McQueen,
it's time to make your move!

535
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,772
Get on the outside
and show 'im what Doc taught you.

536
00:35:52,149 --> 00:35:53,358
10-4, Mater.

537
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:57,403
Oh, boy! Francesco's brought
to a screeching halt!

538
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,740
Lightning McQueen
is the first to take advantage.

539
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:04,452
And just like that, folks,
Francesco's lead is left in the dust.

540
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,331
- Nice call, Mater.
- Keep it up.

541
00:36:08,874 --> 00:36:10,708
Whoo-hoo!

542
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,920
McQueen looks happier than a roll bar
at a demolition derby!

543
00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:18,716
Everyone's jostling for position
as we hit the asphalt again.

544
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:21,386
Francesco lost a lot of momentum
in the dirt.

545
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:30,687
He's got serious work ahead of
him if he wants to get back in this race.

546
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:34,774
The racers hit the Rainbow
Bridge, with its 360-degree loop.

547
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,747
- It is time.
- Roger that.

548
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,716
- Oh!
- Miguel Camino has blown an engine!

549
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,136
- Very unusual, Darrell.
- He's been so consistent all year.

550
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,556
- You gotta be kidding me.
- What is it?

551
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,892
- The tow truck from the bathroom.
- The bathroom?

552
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:11,185
The one the American agent
passed the device to.

553
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,646
- What about him?
- He's in the pits!

554
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,315
Not for long.

555
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,819
- Hold on. I think I've got something.
- What is it?

556
00:37:19,945 --> 00:37:21,154
The Pacer from the party last night.

557
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:25,074
I'm cross-referencing with the photos
from the oil derricks.

558
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,826
Yep. His VIN numbers match.

559
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,828
- Anyone with him?
- He won't be alone.

560
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,749
Conducting analysis on the target.
He's not the only one here.

561
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:36,669
Three, five... They're everywhere.
And they're all closing in on...

562
00:37:37,087 --> 00:37:39,047
Oh, no! Finn? Finn, where are you?

563
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,757
Get him out of the pits. Now!

564
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:43,676
Wow! Some of them fellers
is really loud!

565
00:37:43,802 --> 00:37:46,179
- Can you hear me? Over.
- What?

566
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:48,931
Get out of the pit now! Do you hear me?

567
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:52,518
Hey. I know you! You're that girl
from the party last night.

568
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,354
You wanna do our date now?

569
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:57,398
Guys, too much chatter.
Let's keep this line clear.

570
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,442
Smoke from number 10,
Clutchgoneski!

571
00:37:59,526 --> 00:38:00,693
Ha-ha-ha!

572
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,863
There's no time for
messing about! Get out of the pits!

573
00:38:03,989 --> 00:38:07,408
Is there going to be cable where you is
so I can watch the rest of the race?

574
00:38:07,534 --> 00:38:10,703
- You're running out of time!
- They're coming. Get him out of there!

575
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,081
I'm trying. Get out now.

576
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:17,293
I usually like to have a proper detailin'
done before I meet a lady friend.

577
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,215
Huh?

578
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,679
- Finn McMissile! But you're dead!
- Then this shouldn't hurt.

579
00:38:40,275 --> 00:38:41,734
Miss Shiftwell?

580
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,112
I've got him in the back alleys
east of the garages.

581
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,572
Multiple assailants
are closing in quickly.

582
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,658
Keep him moving. I'm on my way.

583
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:52,995
Hey, new lady friend,
you like flowers?

584
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,080
What?

585
00:38:54,164 --> 00:38:56,666
- No! Don't go in anywhere.
- Just keep moving.

586
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,751
- Stay outside. Got you.
- Outside?

587
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,046
Whoa! McQueen
suddenly moves to the outside.

588
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,217
I cannot believe what I saw.

589
00:39:06,301 --> 00:39:09,137
That was a bonehead move
to open up the inside like that!

590
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,180
That might have cost McQueen
the victory!

591
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:32,952
This time, I'm going to make sure
you stay dead!

592
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:36,539
- You're doing brilliantly.
- Now just stay focused.

593
00:39:36,623 --> 00:39:39,083
What's that? You want me
to head toward that ruckus?

594
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,169
No! Don't go down that street.

595
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:47,467
Ohh!

596
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,014
Hi-yah!

597
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,516
Wow! A live karate demonstration!

598
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,935
Stop it, Mater. Just sign off.

599
00:40:00,647 --> 00:40:02,023
Aaargh!

600
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,903
And here they come,
the two leaders.

601
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,322
Bumper to bumper
as they approach the finish line!

602
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:17,538
- It's close!
- Francesco's the winner!

603
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,248
McQueen's number two.

604
00:40:21,543 --> 00:40:24,670
That was cool!
Can I get your autograph?

605
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,428
Where'd he go?

606
00:40:32,554 --> 00:40:35,515
Our rendezvous has been
jeopardized. Keep the device safe.

607
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,018
- We'll be in touch.
- Dad-gum, did I miss our date?

608
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,025
- Francesco!
- Francesco, over here.

609
00:40:46,151 --> 00:40:47,652
What was your strategy today?

610
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:50,530
Strategia?
Francesco needs-a no strategy.

611
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:51,739
It's-a very simple.

612
00:40:51,865 --> 00:40:55,868
You start the race, wait for Lightning
McQueen to choke, pass him, then win.

613
00:40:55,994 --> 00:40:58,287
Francesco always-a wins. It's-a boring.

614
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:00,665
You were in trouble
for a while.

615
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,708
That dirt track section
had you crawling.

616
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:08,005
To truly crush one's dream, you must
first raise their hopes very high.

617
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:12,218
- Mater!
- Hey, McQueen! What happened?

618
00:41:12,302 --> 00:41:14,345
Is the race over? You won, right?

619
00:41:14,429 --> 00:41:16,806
Why were you yelling at me
while I was racing?

620
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:20,810
Yelling? Oh, you thought...
That's funny right there.

621
00:41:20,894 --> 00:41:23,187
No, that's 'cause I seen
these two fellers doing

622
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,356
some karate street performance.

623
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,900
It was nutso.
One of 'em even had a flame-thrower.

624
00:41:28,026 --> 00:41:30,444
A flame-thrower?
What are you talking about?

625
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:33,322
- I don't understand. Where were you?
- Going to meet my date.

626
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,991
Your date?

627
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:38,119
She started talkin' to me as a voice
in my head, tellin' me where to go.

628
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,329
- What?
- Wait a minute.

629
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:44,041
- I didn't screw ya up, did I?
- I lost the race because of you!

630
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:46,627
Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

631
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:49,755
An imaginary girlfriend?
Flame-throwers?

632
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,092
This is exactly why I don't bring you
along to these things.

633
00:41:53,218 --> 00:41:55,303
Maybe if I, I don't know,

634
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:58,639
talk to somebody and explained
what happened, I could help.

635
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:02,226
I don't need your help!
I don't want your help!

636
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,104
Hey, there he is!

637
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:09,650
- McQueen, you had it in the bag!
- Yeah! What happened?

638
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,694
I made a mistake.

639
00:42:11,778 --> 00:42:14,822
But I can assure you,
it won't happen again.

640
00:42:17,659 --> 00:42:21,245
Look, we know what the problem is
and we've taken care of it.

641
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:26,417
Lightning McQueen loses
in the last lap to Francesco Bernoulli

642
00:42:26,501 --> 00:42:28,961
in the first race of the World Grand Prix.

643
00:42:29,087 --> 00:42:31,839
And three - count 'em -
three cars flamed out

644
00:42:31,965 --> 00:42:35,468
leaving some to suggest that their fuel,
allinol, might be to blame.

645
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:39,096
Allinol is safe. Alternative fuel is safe.

646
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:42,642
There is no way my fuel
caused these cars to flame out.

647
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:46,145
The jury may still be out on whether
allinol caused these accidents,

648
00:42:46,271 --> 00:42:47,563
but one thing's for sure,

649
00:42:47,689 --> 00:42:50,149
Lightning McQueen blew this race.

650
00:42:50,275 --> 00:42:52,860
Team McQueen
can't be happy right now.

651
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:05,373
Welcome to
Tokyo International Airport.

652
00:43:23,975 --> 00:43:26,852
- Come with me, please, sir.
- But I'm 'onna miss my plane.

653
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,730
- Right this way.
- Ah, doggone it.

654
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,691
This is about my hook, ain't it?

655
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,694
I know I should have checked it,
but I can't, really.

656
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,238
Look. It's attached to me.

657
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:40,700
Hey, I know you. You're that feller
from the karate demonstration.

658
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:43,035
I never properly introduced myself.

659
00:43:43,161 --> 00:43:45,538
Finn McMissile. British Intelligence.

660
00:43:45,622 --> 00:43:48,499
Tow Mater. Average intelligence.

661
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:51,210
Who are you with? FBI? CIA?

662
00:43:51,336 --> 00:43:54,338
Let's just say I'm AAA affiliated.

663
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,632
I know some karate.

664
00:43:56,758 --> 00:44:00,261
I don't want to brag or nuttin',
but I got me a black fan belt.

665
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:03,305
- Wanna see some moves I made up?
- You're being followed.

666
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:06,267
This first one,
I can reach into a car's hood

667
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:09,145
pull out his battery,
and show it to him before he stalls.

668
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:13,357
I call it, "What I accidentally did
to my friend Luigi once. "

669
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,151
Hey! Hi-yah-pah!

670
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,236
- Hi-yah!
- There he is!

671
00:44:18,071 --> 00:44:20,072
Hi-hi-tah! Huh!

672
00:44:21,032 --> 00:44:23,784
Look, I probably ought to go.
I'm about to miss my flight.

673
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:26,078
- Don't worry. I've taken care of that.
- Whoa!

674
00:44:26,204 --> 00:44:27,872
Hang on!

675
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,208
Whoa-hah-hah!

676
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:33,502
This is first-class service.

677
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:36,213
You don't even have to go
through the terminal!

678
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,842
Your karate partners is back there.

679
00:44:39,926 --> 00:44:42,136
They look like
they tryin' to catch up!

680
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,722
Drive forward.
Whatever you do, don't stop!

681
00:44:47,392 --> 00:44:49,643
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

682
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:01,447
Whoa...

683
00:45:07,954 --> 00:45:09,413
Is everything okay back there?

684
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,582
Finn, it's Sid. I'm on approach.

685
00:45:11,666 --> 00:45:13,417
Roger that.

686
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:18,464
'Member that whole thing about me
not stoppin' no matter what?

687
00:45:23,678 --> 00:45:25,137
I knew I shoulda done carry-on!

688
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,223
Thanks, old boy.

689
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,558
- You got it, mate.
- Hey, doggonit!

690
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:31,560
Look, it's my imaginary girlfriend!

691
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,229
Come on! Get in here!

692
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:37,024
I tell you what, you really do
want this first date, don't ya?

693
00:45:37,108 --> 00:45:39,151
That's a no-quit attitude right there.

694
00:45:39,277 --> 00:45:40,653
What the...?

695
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,658
- Aargh!
- Hold on, Sid.

696
00:45:55,293 --> 00:45:56,293
Aargh!

697
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:05,469
Come on, Finn! It's now or never!

698
00:46:09,891 --> 00:46:11,892
Hold on!

699
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:18,232
By the time you read this, I will
be safely on an airplane flying home.

700
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,442
I'm so sorry for what I did.

701
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:23,654
"I don't want to be
the cause of you losing any more races. "

702
00:46:23,738 --> 00:46:27,283
"I want you to go prove to the world
what I already know. "

703
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:30,744
"That you are the greatest race car
in the whole wide world. "

704
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:33,289
"Your best friend, Mater. "

705
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:35,374
I didn't really want him to leave.

706
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,793
Wait, there's more here.

707
00:46:37,919 --> 00:46:40,629
"PS. Please tell the hotel"

708
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,923
"I didn't mean to order that movie. "

709
00:46:43,049 --> 00:46:47,678
"I thought it was just a preview
and I didn't realize I was paying for it. "

710
00:46:47,762 --> 00:46:50,931
"PPS. That's funny right there. PP."

711
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:53,726
There are a few more pages
of PS's here.

712
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:57,396
Well, at least I know
if he's at home, he'll be safe.

713
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,483
That's how I like to start the day.

714
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:04,236
You never feel more alive
than when you're almost dead.

715
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,322
Yeah.
I hope that device didn't fall off.

716
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:07,656
Whoa!

717
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:10,409
That's the closest I ever been
to missin' my flight.

718
00:47:10,535 --> 00:47:12,119
That was... Oh!

719
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:15,998
- Still in one piece? Great.
- I've got to go to a doctor.

720
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:18,500
I get these sharp pains
in my undercarriage.

721
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:21,754
- Downloading the photo now.
- Let me introduce you two.

722
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:23,839
This here is Finn McSomethin'
or other.

723
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,800
He's a first-class VIP
airport whatchamacallit.

724
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:30,179
And, Finn, this here is my date.

725
00:47:30,263 --> 00:47:31,931
I never did get your name.

726
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,767
Oh, yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell.
Holley Shiftwell.

727
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:36,518
It's Shiftwell. Holley...

728
00:47:38,104 --> 00:47:40,940
Finally.
Time to see who's behind all this.

729
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,442
What is this?

730
00:47:43,526 --> 00:47:46,195
That's one of the worst engines
ever made.

731
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:50,991
It's an old aluminum V8 with a Lucas
electrical system and Whitworth bolts.

732
00:47:51,117 --> 00:47:54,328
Shoot, them Whitworth bolts is a pain,
tell you what.

733
00:47:54,412 --> 00:47:56,205
Them ain't metric, they ain't inches.

734
00:47:56,289 --> 00:47:58,958
Yes, OK, but whose engine is this?

735
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,585
It's kinda hard to tell from this picture,
ain't it?

736
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,253
- But you took it.
- Holley.

737
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:05,339
Oh. Right! Yes, of course.

738
00:48:05,423 --> 00:48:08,550
A good agent gets what he can,
then gets out before he's killed.

739
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:11,720
Agent? You mean, like,
insurance agent? Like...

740
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:16,183
Like a good neighbor,
Mater is there!

741
00:48:16,434 --> 00:48:19,478
Wait! You mean secret agents!
You guys is spies!

742
00:48:19,562 --> 00:48:22,648
In how many makes and models
did this type of engine appear?

743
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:26,318
It was standard in seven models
over a 12-year period.

744
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:29,780
At least 35,000 cars were made
with this engine.

745
00:48:29,864 --> 00:48:32,074
- You're purty.
- Yes, thank you.

746
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,369
- And so nice.
- Just pay attention.

747
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:37,871
This seems like a dead end.

748
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:42,584
If there was something in the photo that
could narrow this down, I'd be happier.

749
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:45,421
You might not be happy,
but I bet this feller is.

750
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:47,840
See how he's had most of his parts
replaced?

751
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:49,800
And see all them boxes over there?

752
00:48:49,884 --> 00:48:52,928
Them's all original parts.
They ain't easy to come by.

753
00:48:54,013 --> 00:48:55,889
- Rare parts?
- That's something we can track.

754
00:48:56,015 --> 00:48:57,599
Exactly.

755
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:00,519
Well done, Mater.
I would never have seen that.

756
00:49:00,603 --> 00:49:04,314
I know of a black-market parts dealer
in Paris, a treacherous lowlife,

757
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:07,985
but he's the only car in the world
who can tell us whose engine this is.

758
00:49:08,069 --> 00:49:11,739
What would you say to setting up
an informal task force on this one?

759
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:12,906
Wait. What?

760
00:49:13,032 --> 00:49:15,200
You obviously have experience
in the field.

761
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,536
Yeah, I live right next to one.

762
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,663
I don't know.

763
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:22,624
I ain't exactly been much help
to anybody recently.

764
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:24,835
You're helping me.
Please, Mater.

765
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,045
Well... Okay.

766
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,298
But you know
I'm just a tow truck, right?

767
00:49:29,382 --> 00:49:32,676
Right. And I'm just
in the import-export business.

768
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,470
- Siddeley?
- Yes, Finn?

769
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:36,013
Paris. Tout de suite.

770
00:49:36,097 --> 00:49:38,682
Yeah, two of them sweets for me,
too, Sid.

771
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,726
I always wanted to be a spy.

772
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:42,478
Really? Me, too.

773
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:45,564
- Afterburners, sir?
- Is there any other way?

774
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,503
Ha ha ha!

775
00:50:16,262 --> 00:50:18,180
Once we're inside, stay close.

776
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:21,600
Don't bother checking VIN numbers.
They're all dodgy here.

777
00:50:21,726 --> 00:50:22,976
Got it.

778
00:50:23,102 --> 00:50:25,020
Don't talk to anyone,
don't look at anyone,

779
00:50:25,104 --> 00:50:27,981
and absolutely, positively no idling.
Are we clear?

780
00:50:28,107 --> 00:50:29,942
Yes. No idling. Yes, sir.

781
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:32,694
- Mater?
- Yeah, Finn?

782
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:35,948
- We're not here to go shopping.
- Shoppin'? What do you mean?

783
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:37,908
Why would I...

784
00:50:37,992 --> 00:50:39,535
Dad-gum.

785
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:42,621
- Part for sales, monsieur.
- Monsieur, part for sale.

786
00:50:42,705 --> 00:50:44,623
They got everything here. No!

787
00:50:44,749 --> 00:50:47,084
Look at them hoods!
I could use a hood.

788
00:50:47,168 --> 00:50:48,877
Sorry, fellers. I gotta go!

789
00:50:51,005 --> 00:50:53,799
Wow. Whoa. He-he!

790
00:50:54,425 --> 00:50:56,426
Do what?

791
00:50:57,428 --> 00:51:00,138
Excuse me. What are you selling?

792
00:51:00,306 --> 00:51:02,015
Headlights, monsieur, headlights?

793
00:51:02,141 --> 00:51:03,892
- What in the...?
- Two for one.

794
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:05,602
- I give you good price!
- I'm good!

795
00:51:10,483 --> 00:51:13,735
- There you are.
- There is some great bargains here.

796
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,821
- Mater, get back!
- Imbecile!

797
00:51:23,037 --> 00:51:24,413
Hey, wait for me!

798
00:51:41,514 --> 00:51:42,598
Ahhhhhh!

799
00:51:47,645 --> 00:51:49,146
Ag-g-g-h!

800
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:51,481
- Have you lost your mind?
- But I thought...

801
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,609
This chap needs a tow.
Hook him up.

802
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:55,694
Sure thing.

803
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:59,197
You rusty piece of junk!
Get your dirty hook off me!

804
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:09,625
Electroshock! Are you kidding me?

805
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:13,587
This is her first field assignment. She
didn't know you were my informant.

806
00:52:13,671 --> 00:52:15,672
- Informant?
- A rookie, huh?

807
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:17,591
I never liked new car smell.

808
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:21,470
Tomber was doing 20-to-life
in a Moroccan impound

809
00:52:21,554 --> 00:52:24,431
the first time I saved him,
if I recall correctly.

810
00:52:24,557 --> 00:52:28,185
Speaking of recalls, you're getting up
there in mileage, aren't you?

811
00:52:28,269 --> 00:52:31,271
All right, we get it. You both know
each other, you're both old.

812
00:52:31,397 --> 00:52:34,274
So, here you go, informant.
Inform us.

813
00:52:35,234 --> 00:52:37,569
Beuck!
That is the worst motor ever made.

814
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:41,949
Wait. That oil filter.
Those wheel bearings.

815
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:44,117
Do those parts look familiar, Tomber?

816
00:52:44,243 --> 00:52:46,203
They should. I sold them.

817
00:52:46,287 --> 00:52:47,788
- To whom?
- No idea.

818
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:51,333
He's my best customer, but he always
does his business over the phone.

819
00:52:51,709 --> 00:52:54,836
I was always wondering
why he needs so many parts.

820
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:56,171
Now I know.

821
00:52:56,422 --> 00:52:58,840
A lemon needs parts.
Ain't nothin' truer than that.

822
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:02,010
- Lemon?
- Yeah. Cars that don't ever work right.

823
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:04,179
Lemons is a tow truck's
bread and butter.

824
00:53:04,263 --> 00:53:07,099
Like 'em Gremlins and Pacers
we run into at the party

825
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:08,767
and the race and the airport.

826
00:53:08,851 --> 00:53:10,852
Pull up the pictures
from the oil platform.

827
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:13,355
I want to know what other type of cars
were out there.

828
00:53:13,439 --> 00:53:17,150
Right. Let's see.
There were Hugos and Trunkovs.

829
00:53:17,276 --> 00:53:18,944
Are these cars considered lemons?

830
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:20,988
Is the Popemobile Catholic?

831
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:25,033
Everyone involved in this plot
is one of history's biggest loser cars.

832
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:28,203
And they're all taking their orders
from the car behind this engine.

833
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:31,206
- Ah. This explains it.
- What, Tomber?

834
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:34,876
Gremlin, Pacer, Hugo
and Trunkov never get together,

835
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:37,546
but they are having a secret meeting
in two days.

836
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:40,799
- Where's this meeting taking place?
- Porto Corsa, Italy.

837
00:53:40,883 --> 00:53:42,509
That's where the next race is!

838
00:53:42,635 --> 00:53:45,387
There's a good chance
our mystery engine will be there, too.

839
00:53:45,471 --> 00:53:47,431
Your chances are more than good.

840
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:51,143
I just sent him a new clutch assembly
yesterday. To Porto Corsa.

841
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:54,771
Contact Stevenson
and have him meet us at Gare de Lyon.

842
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:56,189
Good work.

843
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:05,073
That three-wheeled feller
had to be right about a big meetin'.

844
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:08,618
You never see this many lemons
in one town.

845
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:11,079
'Less there's a swap meet.

846
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:12,914
How'd you get all them pictures?

847
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:16,710
I reprogrammed Porto Corsa's red light
cameras to do recognition scans.

848
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:21,840
Wow. Not only is you the purtiest car
I ever met, but you're the smartest, too.

849
00:54:21,924 --> 00:54:23,842
Thank you... I think.

850
00:54:23,926 --> 00:54:27,471
- That's a familiar sight.
- A Hugo being towed.

851
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:29,347
But he looks absolutely perfect!

852
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:32,476
Of course! They must be the heads
of the lemon families.

853
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,479
Makes sense. If I was rich
and broke down every day,

854
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:37,898
I'd hire me to tow me
around all the time, too!

855
00:54:37,982 --> 00:54:41,902
We've got to infiltrate that meeting
to find out who's behind all this.

856
00:54:41,986 --> 00:54:44,488
- Hang on a minute. Hold still.
- Ow!

857
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:52,746
Ah-ha. Good job, Miss Shiftwell.

858
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:54,164
Thank you, Finn.

859
00:54:54,248 --> 00:54:56,083
Boy, I sure wish my friends
could see me now.

860
00:55:02,548 --> 00:55:04,966
Guido,
your eyes do not deceive you.

861
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:08,095
We are in Italy. We are home.

862
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:11,389
Hey, Luigi.
Which way to the hotel, man?

863
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:15,685
What? No friend of mine
will stay in a hotel in-a my village.

864
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:19,564
You will stay with my...
Uncle Topolino-o-o-o!

865
00:55:19,732 --> 00:55:22,484
Luigi! Guido!

866
00:55:32,745 --> 00:55:34,621
How do they do it?

867
00:55:34,747 --> 00:55:38,041
These are the same ingredients
as back home, but it tastes so good.

868
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:40,961
- It's organic, man.
- Treehugger.

869
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:45,841
Hey, race car.

870
00:55:45,925 --> 00:55:47,884
You look so down, so low.

871
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,886
Is like you have flat tires.

872
00:55:54,433 --> 00:55:56,143
She said you look like you are starving,

873
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:58,770
that she's gonna make you a big meal
and fatten you up.

874
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,021
Oh, no.

875
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:03,108
Mama Topolino, please,
you don't need to make a fuss.

876
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:05,360
Capisco. I understand.

877
00:56:05,444 --> 00:56:08,280
Is a problem, yes,
between you and a friend?

878
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:09,823
How did you know that?

879
00:56:09,907 --> 00:56:13,118
A wise car hears one word
and understands two.

880
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:15,704
That, and Luigi told me.

881
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:19,958
While Mama cooks,
come and take a stroll with me.

882
00:56:20,042 --> 00:56:22,377
I brought my friend Mater along
on the trip

883
00:56:22,461 --> 00:56:24,713
and I told him he needed
to act different,

884
00:56:24,797 --> 00:56:26,381
that we weren't in Radiator Springs.

885
00:56:26,465 --> 00:56:28,466
This Mater is a close friend?

886
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,635
He's my best friend.

887
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,180
Then why would you ask him to be
someone else?

888
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:39,561
What did I do?

889
00:56:39,645 --> 00:56:41,605
I said some things during our fight.

890
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:44,733
You know, back when Guido and Luigi
used to work for me,

891
00:56:44,817 --> 00:56:47,694
they would fight over everything.

892
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:51,531
They fight over what Ferrari
was the best Ferrari,

893
00:56:51,782 --> 00:56:54,492
which one of them looked
more like a Ferrari.

894
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:56,995
There were even
some non-Ferrari fights.

895
00:56:57,955 --> 00:57:00,582
So I tell them, "Va bene,
it's OK to fight. "

896
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:04,920
"Everybody fights now and then,
especially best friends. "

897
00:57:05,796 --> 00:57:07,547
"But you got to make up fast. "

898
00:57:07,673 --> 00:57:10,217
"No fight more important
than friendship. "

899
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:23,605
- What does that mean?
- Whoever find a friend, find a treasure.

900
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:25,690
Now, mangia. Eat!

901
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,454
Finn, one hour to Porto Corsa.

902
00:57:39,538 --> 00:57:41,289
Thank you, Stevenson.

903
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:43,708
- That should just about do it.
- Perfect.

904
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:46,461
So, Mater, it's voice-activated.

905
00:57:46,545 --> 00:57:49,339
But everything's voice-activated
these days.

906
00:57:49,423 --> 00:57:52,759
What? I thought you was supposed
to be makin' me a disguise.

907
00:57:52,843 --> 00:57:55,595
- Voice recognized.
- Disguise program initiated.

908
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:57,305
Cool!

909
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,391
Computer, make me a German truck.

910
00:57:59,558 --> 00:58:02,602
- Request acknowledged.
- Check it out! I'm wearing Materhosen.

911
00:58:02,728 --> 00:58:03,853
Make me a monster truck!

912
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:05,855
- Request acknowledged.
- What the...?

913
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,233
I vant to siphon your gas!

914
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:11,319
- Now make me a taco truck!
- Request acknowledged.

915
00:58:13,447 --> 00:58:15,907
- A funny car!
- Request acknowledged.

916
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,204
The idea is to keep a low profile, Mater.

917
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,581
So I just go in, pretend to be this truck.

918
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:26,459
- And leave the rest to us.
- Now, hold still.

919
00:58:26,585 --> 00:58:28,420
I have to do the final fitting
on your disguise.

920
00:58:32,591 --> 00:58:34,592
That's no good. Hm.

921
00:58:37,596 --> 00:58:39,097
Hey. What are you doin'?

922
00:58:39,223 --> 00:58:43,101
The disguise won't calibrate effectively
without a smooth surface to graft onto.

923
00:58:43,185 --> 00:58:46,104
For a second there, I thought
you was tryin' to fix my dents.

924
00:58:46,188 --> 00:58:48,565
- Yes, I was.
- Then, no, thank you.

925
00:58:48,649 --> 00:58:52,527
I don't get them dents buffed,
pulled, filled or painted by nobody.

926
00:58:53,654 --> 00:58:56,031
- They way too valuable.
- Your dents are valuable? Really?

927
00:58:56,115 --> 00:59:00,201
I come by each one of 'em with
my best friend, Lightning McQueen.

928
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:03,830
I don't fix these.
I wanna remember these dents forever.

929
00:59:03,956 --> 00:59:09,294
So, you were being serious in Paris?
McQueen isn't just part of your cover.

930
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:12,380
Friendships can be dangerous
in our line of work, Mater.

931
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:14,507
But my line of work
is towin' and salvage.

932
00:59:14,633 --> 00:59:17,677
Right. And Miss Shiftwell's
is designing iPhone apps.

933
00:59:17,803 --> 00:59:21,139
- No, I meant for real.
- It's OK. I'll work around the dent.

934
00:59:21,265 --> 00:59:23,683
- Oh...
- In the meantime...

935
00:59:25,561 --> 00:59:27,520
.. you look a little light on weapons.

936
00:59:36,113 --> 00:59:38,865
You are looking live
at beautiful

937
00:59:38,949 --> 00:59:41,284
Porto Corsa, Italy,
on the Italian Riviera.

938
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:46,414
What a magnificent setting for the
second race of the World Grand Prix!

939
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:49,376
Brent, they call this place
the "Gem of the Riviera,"

940
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,086
and it's easy to see why.

941
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:53,922
With its secluded beaches
and opulent casinos,

942
00:59:54,006 --> 00:59:56,841
Porto Corsa truly is a playground
for the wealthy.

943
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,177
And everyone who's anyone
is here today,

944
01:00:00,012 --> 01:00:02,055
from the ultra-rich and super-famous

945
01:00:02,139 --> 01:00:04,516
to world leaders
and important dignitaries.

946
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,351
You aren't kidding, David.

947
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:09,729
You can't do a three-point turn
without bumping into some celebrity.

948
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:12,315
Welcome, everyone, to the second race
of the World Grand Prix,

949
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,860
where the big news
continues to be allinol.

950
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:18,780
Sir Miles Axlerod spoke to the press
earlier today

951
01:00:18,864 --> 01:00:21,116
to answer questions about its safety.

952
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,910
An independent panel of scientists
has determined

953
01:00:23,994 --> 01:00:26,037
that allinol is completely safe, okay?

954
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:27,622
Safe. There it is.

955
01:00:27,748 --> 01:00:29,374
So the race will go on, folks.

956
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,209
But the question everyone is asking:

957
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:34,003
Will the real
Lightning McQueen show up today?

958
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:37,132
- He'd better.
- Talk about a home track advantage.

959
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:40,093
Francesco Bernoulli
grew up racing on this course.

960
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:45,098
Signore e signori, in the
pole position, Numero Uno, Francesco!

961
01:00:45,182 --> 01:00:48,309
Bellissima!
Thank you for your support!

962
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:50,353
And your big mistake, McQueen!

963
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:52,939
In secondo position,

964
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:57,652
numero 95, Lightning-a McQueen-a!

965
01:00:58,237 --> 01:01:00,196
McQueen-a, is-a everything OK?

966
01:01:00,322 --> 01:01:04,159
If you're worried about your fuel, man,
don't. It's perfectly safe.

967
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:07,745
No, guys,
I just really wish Mater were here.

968
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,789
Francesco understands, McQueen.

969
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:11,833
Oh, great, here it comes.

970
01:01:11,917 --> 01:01:13,877
What do you got, Francesco?

971
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:17,255
For famous race cars like Francesco
and, well, you,

972
01:01:17,381 --> 01:01:20,341
to be far away from home is not easy.

973
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:23,553
I think you forgot
the insulting part of that insult.

974
01:01:23,637 --> 01:01:25,180
Is-a no insult.

975
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:28,266
When-a Francesco is away from home,
he misses his mama,

976
01:01:28,350 --> 01:01:31,186
just like-a you miss
your tow truck amico.

977
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:34,272
Gee, I maybe misjudged you,
because that's exactly...

978
01:01:34,398 --> 01:01:38,568
Of course, I am at home,
and my mama is right here.

979
01:01:38,652 --> 01:01:40,528
Mama!

980
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:44,699
Don't worry, Mama,
McQueen is very sad.

981
01:01:44,825 --> 01:01:47,202
I will beat his cry-baby bottom today!

982
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:51,372
And there's the insult we were missing.

983
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:09,974
Darrell, the racers
are settling in as they head

984
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:11,392
to the Italian countryside.

985
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,394
Whoo, boy!

986
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:16,064
This is gonna be a great race.

987
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:31,246
Gremlins.
Man, those are some ugly cars.

988
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,414
Look like someone stole their trunks.

989
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:40,630
My grand-a father has-a broken down.

990
01:02:40,714 --> 01:02:44,551
If-a one of-a you would help,
I would be so thankful.

991
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:47,679
Sounds like you need
some roadside assistance.

992
01:02:47,763 --> 01:02:50,014
- She was talking to me.
- Really? Prove it.

993
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:52,058
Don't-a fight over me.

994
01:02:52,142 --> 01:02:55,019
SignoreTow Truck, per favore.

995
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:58,022
Get ready, Mater.
You're on any moment now.

996
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:02,277
I don't know about this.
What if I screw things up?

997
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:03,903
Impossible.

998
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:05,989
Just apply the same level of dedication

999
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:09,576
you've been using to play
the idiot tow truck, and you'll be fine.

1000
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:13,955
It's just that them guys look purty tough
and... Wait, did you say "idiot"?

1001
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:17,125
- Is that how you see me?
- That's how everyone sees you.

1002
01:03:17,209 --> 01:03:18,626
Isn't that the idea?

1003
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:20,670
I tell you, that's the genius of it.

1004
01:03:20,754 --> 01:03:22,797
No one realizes they're being fooled

1005
01:03:22,923 --> 01:03:25,508
because they're too busy laughing
at the fool.

1006
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:27,135
Brilliant!

1007
01:03:30,222 --> 01:03:32,307
- Why aren't you in disguise?
- I er...

1008
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:35,268
- Come on! There's no time! Go!
- OK. OK.

1009
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:38,396
- Computer, disguise!
- Request acknowledged.

1010
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:46,487
It's the boss. He's coming.

1011
01:03:52,369 --> 01:03:53,411
Ivan.

1012
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:56,039
Oh, er...

1013
01:03:56,123 --> 01:04:00,585
Ivan, why do you insult me so
by making me wait here?

1014
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:10,428
He's in.

1015
01:04:12,931 --> 01:04:15,600
The racers are now
making their way around the hairpin

1016
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:18,436
and headed downhill
toward the casino bridge.

1017
01:04:34,828 --> 01:04:36,454
No more bets, please.

1018
01:04:36,538 --> 01:04:38,081
Come on, fuzzy dice!

1019
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:40,124
- Number four. Easy four.
- Yeah!

1020
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:42,168
Air freshener. Antenna balls.

1021
01:04:42,252 --> 01:04:44,045
Spark-a plugs.

1022
01:04:44,129 --> 01:04:46,547
This place looks like
it's made outta gold!

1023
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:49,884
- That's because it is.
- Now, be careful what you say.

1024
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:51,969
Why is that?

1025
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:54,013
What do you mean, "Don't talk to ya"?

1026
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:56,474
You want me to stop talkin' to ya
right now?

1027
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,559
You are acting strange today, Ivan.

1028
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:02,230
I have no idea
what you're talking about,

1029
01:05:02,314 --> 01:05:05,566
"Alexander Hugo, aka Chop Shop Alex. "

1030
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:07,568
You got a lot of aka's, Alex.

1031
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:11,697
But that makes sense, seein's how
you's wanted in France, Germany...

1032
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:13,157
Mater, stop it!

1033
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:15,201
OK, OK, keep your voice down!

1034
01:05:15,285 --> 01:05:17,245
You gonna make me arrested!

1035
01:05:17,329 --> 01:05:19,831
Don't mess with Ivan today.
He's in a bad mood.

1036
01:05:19,915 --> 01:05:21,666
He's so good!

1037
01:05:23,168 --> 01:05:24,669
Victor!

1038
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:27,380
Hey, Victor!

1039
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:29,424
- There you are!
- Come in!

1040
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:33,636
Victor Hugo, I'm J Curby Gremlin.
From Detroit.

1041
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,513
It's good to see you.

1042
01:05:35,597 --> 01:05:37,390
Is the big boss here yet?

1043
01:05:37,516 --> 01:05:40,643
- No, not yet.
- He's supposed to be here any minute.

1044
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:46,524
Here we go.

1045
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:50,236
Guten Tag.

1046
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,321
It's just the professor.

1047
01:05:52,406 --> 01:05:54,031
Zundapp! When is he coming?

1048
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,033
He's already here.

1049
01:05:58,203 --> 01:06:00,455
Welcome, everyone.

1050
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:03,749
I wish I could be with you
on this very special day,

1051
01:06:03,876 --> 01:06:05,877
but my clutch assembly broke.

1052
01:06:05,961 --> 01:06:08,087
- You know how it is.
- Forget about it.

1053
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:09,797
We know how you feel.

1054
01:06:09,882 --> 01:06:12,091
- Descramble that voice.
- I'm trying.

1055
01:06:12,176 --> 01:06:14,302
Oh, it's too sophisticated.

1056
01:06:14,386 --> 01:06:16,387
We are here to celebrate.

1057
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:18,890
Today, all your hard work pays off.

1058
01:06:19,975 --> 01:06:22,685
The world turned their backs
on cars like us.

1059
01:06:22,769 --> 01:06:26,230
They stopped manufacturing us,
stopped making our parts.

1060
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:30,776
The only thing they haven't stopped
doing is laughing at us.

1061
01:06:31,528 --> 01:06:35,865
Jalopy, rust bucket, heap,

1062
01:06:36,408 --> 01:06:40,119
clunker, junker, beater,
wreck, rattletrap,

1063
01:06:41,455 --> 01:06:42,747
lemon.

1064
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:46,209
But their insults just give us strength.

1065
01:06:46,293 --> 01:06:51,506
Because today, my friends,
that all ends!

1066
01:06:52,674 --> 01:06:54,759
There's smoke
on the casino bridge!

1067
01:06:54,885 --> 01:06:55,885
Oh, no!

1068
01:06:55,969 --> 01:06:57,595
It's Carla Veloso, the Brazilian race car!

1069
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:04,477
- What just happened?
- I'm working on it.

1070
01:07:06,438 --> 01:07:10,274
They laughed at us,
but now it's our turn to laugh back.

1071
01:07:12,611 --> 01:07:15,613
- Another crash!
- It's number 9, Nigel Gearsley.

1072
01:07:16,281 --> 01:07:17,990
Embrace your inner lemon.

1073
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:19,700
Let it drive you.

1074
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:23,246
I'm detecting an extremely strong
electromagnetic pulse.

1075
01:07:27,167 --> 01:07:29,043
- Finn, it's the camera.
- Where?

1076
01:07:29,169 --> 01:07:30,962
On the tower!

1077
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:37,343
This was meant to
be alternative fuel's greatest moment.

1078
01:07:37,427 --> 01:07:41,264
But after today,
everyone will race back to gasoline.

1079
01:07:41,348 --> 01:07:44,809
And we, the owners of the world's
largest untapped oil reserve

1080
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:48,604
will become the most powerful cars
in the world!

1081
01:07:49,189 --> 01:07:50,731
Get out of the way!

1082
01:08:25,934 --> 01:08:30,021
They will come to us, and they will have
no choice, because they will need us.

1083
01:08:37,321 --> 01:08:38,696
Huh? Whoa!

1084
01:08:39,531 --> 01:08:41,532
We figured you might stop by!

1085
01:08:44,244 --> 01:08:46,871
And they will finally respect us!

1086
01:08:46,997 --> 01:08:48,998
So hold your hoods high!

1087
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:52,335
After today, you will never again
be ashamed of who you are!

1088
01:08:53,712 --> 01:08:55,087
No!

1089
01:08:55,213 --> 01:08:57,381
Long live lemons!

1090
01:08:58,508 --> 01:09:00,885
- Number 7 is loose!
- Shu Todoroki!

1091
01:09:24,826 --> 01:09:26,077
Finn?

1092
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:29,538
Bumper to bumper
as they approach the finish line!

1093
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:31,665
McQueen's the winner!
Francesco's second!

1094
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:33,709
They have no idea
what happened behind them.

1095
01:09:34,002 --> 01:09:35,669
This is impossible!

1096
01:09:35,754 --> 01:09:37,671
That's what I'm talking about! Ka-chow!

1097
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:39,548
What happened?

1098
01:09:39,716 --> 01:09:42,426
- Where are all the other cars?
- What is going on?

1099
01:09:43,261 --> 01:09:44,428
Oh, no!

1100
01:09:50,310 --> 01:09:53,938
Sir Axlerod, is the final race in London
still going to take place?

1101
01:09:54,064 --> 01:09:55,981
I suppose that...

1102
01:09:56,108 --> 01:09:59,360
The show must go on,
as they say.

1103
01:09:59,444 --> 01:10:01,529
I can't believe this is really happening!

1104
01:10:01,613 --> 01:10:02,696
Quiet!

1105
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:05,825
Will you require all the racers
to still run on allinol?

1106
01:10:05,951 --> 01:10:10,788
I cannot, in good conscience, continue
to risk the lives of any more race cars.

1107
01:10:11,415 --> 01:10:14,708
The final race will not be run on allinol.

1108
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,962
There you have it, a clearly devastated
Sir Miles Axlerod

1109
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:22,216
announcing that he will not require
the cars to use allinol for the final race.

1110
01:10:22,342 --> 01:10:23,676
A toast!

1111
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:27,430
To the death of allinol
and alternative fuel forever!

1112
01:10:27,514 --> 01:10:30,391
Mater, abort the mission.

1113
01:10:30,475 --> 01:10:33,894
They've got Finn. Get out of there.
Get out of there right now.

1114
01:10:34,646 --> 01:10:36,355
How is your grandfather?

1115
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,399
Long live lemons!

1116
01:10:38,483 --> 01:10:40,818
Isn't this a great party, Ivan, huh?

1117
01:10:40,944 --> 01:10:42,736
Oh, yeah, it's unbelievable.

1118
01:10:42,821 --> 01:10:44,905
You are not leaving, are you?

1119
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:46,907
Uh... of course I ain't leaving.

1120
01:10:46,992 --> 01:10:48,742
- I'm just in shock...
- McQueen?

1121
01:10:49,619 --> 01:10:51,579
Crashes are a part of racing, I know,

1122
01:10:51,663 --> 01:10:54,331
but something like that
should never happen.

1123
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:58,461
You can choose your fuel
for the final race. What it'll be?

1124
01:10:58,545 --> 01:11:00,045
Allinol.

1125
01:11:00,172 --> 01:11:01,422
After today?

1126
01:11:01,506 --> 01:11:04,467
My friend Fillmore says it's safe.
That's good enough for me.

1127
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:06,927
I didn't stand by a friend of mine
recently.

1128
01:11:07,012 --> 01:11:09,221
I'm not gonna make
the same mistake twice.

1129
01:11:09,556 --> 01:11:12,266
So a surprising revelation
from Lightning McQueen.

1130
01:11:12,392 --> 01:11:16,020
He will use allinol in the final race,
despite what occurred today.

1131
01:11:16,146 --> 01:11:18,856
- .. Till Lightning McQueen is dead.
- Of course.

1132
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:23,027
Allinol must be finished for good.

1133
01:11:23,695 --> 01:11:26,071
McQueen cannot win the last race.

1134
01:11:26,823 --> 01:11:29,074
Lightning McQueen must be killed!

1135
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:30,451
No!

1136
01:11:37,542 --> 01:11:39,460
It's the American spy!

1137
01:11:40,879 --> 01:11:42,004
Dad-gum!

1138
01:11:42,088 --> 01:11:44,173
- Gatlinggun.
- Request acknowledged.

1139
01:11:44,257 --> 01:11:46,175
Down! Everybody, down!

1140
01:11:46,301 --> 01:11:49,220
- Shoot! I didn't mean...
- Request acknowledged.

1141
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:03,609
Wait! Wait!
I didn't mean that kind of shoot!

1142
01:12:03,693 --> 01:12:05,819
Correction
acknowledged. Deploying chute.

1143
01:12:05,904 --> 01:12:07,446
Whoa!

1144
01:12:12,452 --> 01:12:13,494
McQueen!

1145
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:19,166
Whoa! What's this?

1146
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:20,584
Whoa!

1147
01:12:24,798 --> 01:12:26,549
McQueen! McQueen!

1148
01:12:29,594 --> 01:12:30,594
Waagh!

1149
01:12:33,139 --> 01:12:34,974
Let me through! Let me through!

1150
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:37,518
Let me in!
I got to get through to warn McQueen!

1151
01:12:37,602 --> 01:12:39,562
You cannot-a come through here!
Back up.

1152
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:41,105
We have a lunatic at gate 9.

1153
01:12:41,189 --> 01:12:44,984
I was disguised as a tow truck
to infiltrate this lemonhead meeting

1154
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:48,112
and my weapons system's done
misinterperated what I'm saying!

1155
01:12:48,196 --> 01:12:50,864
- Lunatic at gate 9.
- McQueen! McQueen!

1156
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:53,158
- You are the champion!
Thisway, signore.

1157
01:12:53,243 --> 01:12:55,202
- McQueen!
- Mater?

1158
01:12:55,287 --> 01:12:57,705
- McQueen.
- Give us a pose!

1159
01:12:57,789 --> 01:13:00,124
- McQueen!
- Stop moving. Stop!

1160
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:01,959
Where you going?

1161
01:13:02,043 --> 01:13:03,252
Stop!

1162
01:13:03,837 --> 01:13:06,255
- McQueen!
- That really sounded like...

1163
01:13:06,339 --> 01:13:07,548
Mater!

1164
01:13:07,632 --> 01:13:09,174
- Mater?
- Signore?

1165
01:13:09,259 --> 01:13:11,343
- McQueen!
- They're gonna kill you!

1166
01:13:11,428 --> 01:13:12,803
Mater!

1167
01:13:12,929 --> 01:13:14,221
Excuse me.

1168
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:16,098
No, where are you going?

1169
01:13:16,182 --> 01:13:17,933
Scusi. Mater!

1170
01:13:18,018 --> 01:13:19,602
- McQueen!
- Scusi.

1171
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:22,146
Mater! Mater!

1172
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:24,189
Mater, I'm so glad to see you.

1173
01:13:24,274 --> 01:13:27,359
Lightning McQueen!
I am a huge fan.

1174
01:13:27,444 --> 01:13:29,069
I'm sorry, I thought I heard...

1175
01:13:29,154 --> 01:13:33,157
That was me. I said, "You killed
out there today. You're the best. "

1176
01:13:33,241 --> 01:13:35,993
- What? I mean, thanks.
- Right this way, signore.

1177
01:13:36,077 --> 01:13:38,078
I really thought I heard my friend.

1178
01:13:39,873 --> 01:13:43,250
In England, you'll be finished!
At the finish line.

1179
01:13:44,294 --> 01:13:46,587
- Wait, what?
- The press is waiting.

1180
01:13:46,671 --> 01:13:48,172
Come-a with me, please.

1181
01:13:52,385 --> 01:13:53,761
Let me go!

1182
01:13:53,845 --> 01:13:55,971
You actually care about that race car.

1183
01:13:56,431 --> 01:13:58,432
A pity you didn't warn him in time.

1184
01:14:06,232 --> 01:14:08,108
- "Idiot"?
- Is that how you see me?

1185
01:14:08,234 --> 01:14:11,320
- That's how everyone sees you.
- I tell you, that's the genius of it.

1186
01:14:11,404 --> 01:14:13,447
No one realizes they're being fooled

1187
01:14:13,531 --> 01:14:16,283
because they're too busy laughing
at the fool.

1188
01:14:16,368 --> 01:14:18,369
At the fool...

1189
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:20,663
Excuse me!

1190
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:22,706
Domo arigato!

1191
01:14:22,832 --> 01:14:24,083
Yeah!

1192
01:14:26,461 --> 01:14:28,295
You done good. You got all the leaves.

1193
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:30,881
- Check out that tow truck.
- I wonder who that guy's with.

1194
01:14:31,007 --> 01:14:33,884
Will you guys excuse me
just for one little second?

1195
01:14:34,386 --> 01:14:36,678
Now that's a scoop of ice cream!

1196
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:41,475
Aargh!

1197
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:46,522
Somebody get me water!
Oh, sweet relief.

1198
01:14:46,606 --> 01:14:47,940
Mater!

1199
01:14:52,862 --> 01:14:54,822
But I never leak oil. Never.

1200
01:14:54,906 --> 01:14:56,907
Get a hold of yourself.
You're making a scene!

1201
01:14:57,492 --> 01:14:59,701
Wait a minute.
I didn't screw you up, did I?

1202
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:02,830
- I lost the race because of you!
- Maybe if I talked to somebody...

1203
01:15:02,914 --> 01:15:04,832
I don't need your help!

1204
01:15:04,916 --> 01:15:06,875
I don't want your help.

1205
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,961
Your help...

1206
01:15:09,587 --> 01:15:11,547
Bang the gong. Get it on!

1207
01:15:11,631 --> 01:15:13,715
Listen,
this isn't Radiator Springs.

1208
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:17,136
This is exactly why I don't bring
you along to these things!

1209
01:15:28,106 --> 01:15:30,732
Holley! Finn! Where are we?

1210
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:34,111
We're in London, Mater,
inside Big Bentley.

1211
01:15:39,742 --> 01:15:42,911
Whoa!

1212
01:15:50,128 --> 01:15:52,087
Oh, this... This is all my fault.

1213
01:15:52,172 --> 01:15:54,131
Don't be a fool, Mater.

1214
01:15:54,215 --> 01:15:56,175
But I am, remember? You said so.

1215
01:15:56,301 --> 01:15:58,218
When did I... Oh.

1216
01:15:58,303 --> 01:16:02,306
Mater, I was complimenting you
on what a good spy you are.

1217
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:04,224
I'm not a spy!

1218
01:16:07,312 --> 01:16:09,771
I've been trying to tell you that
the whole time.

1219
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:11,982
I really am just a tow truck.

1220
01:16:12,108 --> 01:16:13,942
Finn, he's not joking.

1221
01:16:14,027 --> 01:16:17,905
- I know.
- You were right, Finn. I'm a fool.

1222
01:16:17,989 --> 01:16:21,366
And what's happened to McQueen
is 'cause I'm such a big one.

1223
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,161
This is all my fault.

1224
01:16:27,248 --> 01:16:30,000
- Good. You're up.
- And just in time.

1225
01:16:30,126 --> 01:16:32,794
Professor Z wanted you
to have a front-row seat,

1226
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:34,838
for the death of Lightning McQueen.

1227
01:16:34,964 --> 01:16:38,008
- He's still alive?
- Not for much longer.

1228
01:16:42,514 --> 01:16:43,514
Whoa!

1229
01:16:43,973 --> 01:16:45,057
Huh?

1230
01:16:51,147 --> 01:16:53,857
- We came as soon as you called.
- I called to talk to Mater.

1231
01:16:53,983 --> 01:16:56,193
It never occurred to me
he wouldn't be there.

1232
01:16:56,277 --> 01:16:58,362
Sheriff is talking to Scotland Yard now.

1233
01:16:58,488 --> 01:17:01,490
And Sarge is in touch with his friends
in the British military.

1234
01:17:01,574 --> 01:17:03,242
You just need
to focus on the race.

1235
01:17:03,368 --> 01:17:05,953
I know but, Sally with everything
going on, I'm not sure...

1236
01:17:07,163 --> 01:17:09,456
- Sir Axlerod.
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

1237
01:17:09,582 --> 01:17:12,751
- It's all right.
- I just wanted to personally thank you.

1238
01:17:12,835 --> 01:17:17,798
Because after Italy, I was finished,
and then you gave me one last shot.

1239
01:17:17,882 --> 01:17:18,882
Listen...

1240
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:22,302
I probably shouldn't be saying this,
but I hope you win today.

1241
01:17:22,428 --> 01:17:25,722
You show the world
that they've been wrong about allinol.

1242
01:17:26,432 --> 01:17:28,433
Mater would want you to race.

1243
01:17:29,602 --> 01:17:31,561
All right. For Mater.

1244
01:18:05,888 --> 01:18:07,347
Here he comes.

1245
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:27,659
- What happened?
- I don't know, Professor.

1246
01:18:27,744 --> 01:18:29,911
- What did you do?
- I didn't do nothing.

1247
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:33,165
Ssh, I'm talking to the Professor.
What's that, Professor?

1248
01:18:33,291 --> 01:18:34,791
- You broke it!
- Quiet!

1249
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:37,252
- I understand, sir. Yes.
- What did he say?

1250
01:18:37,337 --> 01:18:40,255
- We go to the back-up plan.
- Back-up plan?

1251
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:42,341
We snuck a bomb in McQueen's pit.

1252
01:18:42,675 --> 01:18:46,053
The next time he makes a stop,
instead of saying "ka-chow"...

1253
01:18:46,137 --> 01:18:48,138
he's going to go "ka-boom"!

1254
01:18:50,058 --> 01:18:52,559
Don't feel bad, tow truck.
You couldn't have saved him.

1255
01:18:52,643 --> 01:18:54,811
Oh, wait, you could have!

1256
01:18:54,937 --> 01:18:57,356
- Dad-gum lemons!
- Request acknowledged.

1257
01:18:58,066 --> 01:19:00,609
What?
You didn't think we'd take your bullets?

1258
01:19:03,821 --> 01:19:05,947
That's right! You got nothing!

1259
01:19:06,991 --> 01:19:08,950
Who's the lemon now, huh?

1260
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:13,497
Nice try, Mater.

1261
01:19:14,290 --> 01:19:17,709
- Dad-gum... Dad-gum... Dad-gum.
- Request... Request... Request...

1262
01:19:18,503 --> 01:19:19,961
Mater!

1263
01:19:25,176 --> 01:19:26,927
I got to get y'all out of there.

1264
01:19:27,011 --> 01:19:29,388
There's no time.
McQueen needs your help.

1265
01:19:29,514 --> 01:19:31,807
But I can't. I'm just a tow truck.

1266
01:19:31,891 --> 01:19:34,309
It's up to you.
Go to the pits and get everyone out.

1267
01:19:34,394 --> 01:19:36,895
- You can do that.
- What about you guys?

1268
01:19:37,021 --> 01:19:40,440
- We'll be OK.
- Go and get some more dents, Mater.

1269
01:19:49,158 --> 01:19:51,118
So, we'll be OK? Really?

1270
01:19:51,202 --> 01:19:53,787
He wouldn't have left
if I'd told him the truth.

1271
01:19:53,871 --> 01:19:55,205
Argh!

1272
01:19:55,331 --> 01:19:56,915
Being killed by a clock.

1273
01:19:56,999 --> 01:19:59,751
Gives a whole new meaning to
"Your time has come. "

1274
01:19:59,836 --> 01:20:01,837
Time? That's it!

1275
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:12,681
- What are you doing?
- Trying to turn back time.

1276
01:20:16,185 --> 01:20:19,229
If I can just reverse the polarity.

1277
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:24,860
Good job. Quick thinking, Holley.

1278
01:20:31,909 --> 01:20:34,786
What's everybody
on the wrong side of the road for?

1279
01:20:36,789 --> 01:20:38,540
Oh, no!

1280
01:20:38,624 --> 01:20:40,625
Drive! Burn rubber!

1281
01:20:47,383 --> 01:20:49,384
We've got to get to the course.

1282
01:20:50,094 --> 01:20:52,220
Calculate the fastest way to...

1283
01:20:53,723 --> 01:20:54,764
Done.

1284
01:20:54,849 --> 01:20:56,558
Oh. Miss Shiftwell.

1285
01:20:56,642 --> 01:21:00,437
- They're standard issue now.
- You kids get all the good hardware.

1286
01:21:02,315 --> 01:21:03,899
Oh, no, that's Mater's.

1287
01:21:04,275 --> 01:21:05,817
I knew his escape was too easy.

1288
01:21:16,996 --> 01:21:18,455
Come back here! Stop!

1289
01:21:21,792 --> 01:21:23,585
- Mater?
- Everybody, get out now!

1290
01:21:24,670 --> 01:21:27,505
Y'all get out of the pits.
What are you guys doing here?

1291
01:21:27,632 --> 01:21:30,217
- We're here because of you, Mater.
- Is everything OK?

1292
01:21:30,301 --> 01:21:32,928
No, everything's not OK.
There's a bomb in here.

1293
01:21:33,012 --> 01:21:34,971
- Y'all got to get out. Now.
- A bomb?

1294
01:21:36,599 --> 01:21:38,141
- Mater.
- Finn! You're OK.

1295
01:21:38,267 --> 01:21:41,978
Listen to me. The bomb is on you!
They knew you'd try to help McQueen.

1296
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:46,149
When we were knocked out,
they planted it in your air filter.

1297
01:21:48,527 --> 01:21:51,154
- Uh-oh.
- Mater! There you are!

1298
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:54,074
- Stop right there!
- I've been so worried about you.

1299
01:21:54,158 --> 01:21:55,867
- Don't come any closer!
- Are you OK?

1300
01:21:55,952 --> 01:21:57,953
No, I'm not OK! Stay away from me!

1301
01:21:58,704 --> 01:22:00,163
No, wait! Wait!

1302
01:22:00,289 --> 01:22:04,125
A tow truck has just raced
onto the track, driving backwards!

1303
01:22:04,794 --> 01:22:06,670
Mater, wait!

1304
01:22:07,004 --> 01:22:10,090
Normally an emergency vehicle on the
track means there's been an accident.

1305
01:22:10,174 --> 01:22:12,884
- Lightning McQueen is chasing him!
- Mater, wait!

1306
01:22:12,969 --> 01:22:16,763
Stay back! If you get close to me,
you're going to get hurt real bad!

1307
01:22:16,889 --> 01:22:20,767
I know I made you feel that
way before, but none of that matters!

1308
01:22:20,851 --> 01:22:22,352
We're best friends!

1309
01:22:24,355 --> 01:22:26,022
And McQueen
seems to be having

1310
01:22:26,107 --> 01:22:27,899
a conversation with the tow truck.

1311
01:22:28,025 --> 01:22:30,735
I don't know who
that truck is, Brent, but tell you what,

1312
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:33,196
he's got to be the world's best
backwards driver.

1313
01:22:34,115 --> 01:22:37,117
McQueen, you don't get it!
I'm the bomb!

1314
01:22:37,201 --> 01:22:40,745
Yes, Mater! You are the bomb!
That's what I'm trying to say here!

1315
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:44,291
You've always been the bomb
and you'll always be the bomb.

1316
01:22:44,375 --> 01:22:46,876
- Stay away!
- No! Never!

1317
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:50,714
Almost there.

1318
01:22:50,798 --> 01:22:54,592
I'm not letting you get away again!

1319
01:22:55,386 --> 01:22:58,596
- Got to keep away from McQueen!
- Request acknowledged.

1320
01:22:58,681 --> 01:23:00,557
Oh, my gosh.

1321
01:23:13,571 --> 01:23:15,572
What is happening? It's a bad dream!

1322
01:23:17,074 --> 01:23:19,576
And Lightning McQueen
just blasted away,

1323
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:22,037
hooked to the now rocket-propelled
tow truck.

1324
01:23:24,248 --> 01:23:25,623
Gargh!

1325
01:23:30,463 --> 01:23:31,463
Aagh!

1326
01:23:35,801 --> 01:23:37,344
The Professor's on the run!

1327
01:23:37,428 --> 01:23:40,013
- Someone's got to get McQueen.
- Get McQueen!

1328
01:23:41,432 --> 01:23:44,142
- Holley, I'll get Zundapp. Help Mater.
- Got it!

1329
01:23:47,938 --> 01:23:49,939
What is happening?

1330
01:24:03,996 --> 01:24:05,455
Hurry, Professor.

1331
01:24:17,218 --> 01:24:20,053
You really think I'm going to let you
float away, Professor?

1332
01:24:47,581 --> 01:24:49,541
- McQueen, let go!
- Never!

1333
01:24:52,002 --> 01:24:54,129
- They're coming your way.
- Let's go!

1334
01:25:02,263 --> 01:25:03,680
Give it up, McMissile.

1335
01:25:19,989 --> 01:25:23,491
- Mater, stop!
- No way! You could get hurt.

1336
01:25:29,373 --> 01:25:30,748
Oh, no.

1337
01:25:52,021 --> 01:25:53,646
Mater, we've got to get
that bomb off you.

1338
01:25:53,731 --> 01:25:54,731
Bomb?

1339
01:25:55,024 --> 01:25:57,942
Yeah, they strapped it to me
to kill you as a back-up plan.

1340
01:25:58,027 --> 01:26:00,528
Back-up plan?
Mater, who put a bomb on you?

1341
01:26:01,864 --> 01:26:04,324
You! Why didn't my death ray kill you?

1342
01:26:04,408 --> 01:26:05,742
Death ray?

1343
01:26:05,826 --> 01:26:07,160
Turn off the bomb, Zundapp!

1344
01:26:07,244 --> 01:26:09,746
Are you all so dense?
It's voice-activated.

1345
01:26:09,830 --> 01:26:11,956
Everything is voice-activated
these days.

1346
01:26:12,041 --> 01:26:13,917
Deactivate! Deactivate!

1347
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:16,127
Voice denied.

1348
01:26:17,838 --> 01:26:19,380
- Huh!
- Oops.

1349
01:26:19,506 --> 01:26:21,966
Did I forget to mention
that it can only be disarmed

1350
01:26:22,051 --> 01:26:23,760
by the one who activated it?

1351
01:26:24,094 --> 01:26:26,012
- Say it.
- Deactivate.

1352
01:26:26,972 --> 01:26:28,431
Voice denied.

1353
01:26:31,393 --> 01:26:34,938
I'm not the one who activated it.
Would anyone else like to try?

1354
01:26:35,856 --> 01:26:38,191
- You read my mind.
- He was getting on my nerves.

1355
01:26:38,275 --> 01:26:41,819
- What do we do?
- It's very simple. You blow up.

1356
01:26:42,238 --> 01:26:45,990
I'm going out on a limb here. These are
the guys that want me dead, correct?

1357
01:26:46,075 --> 01:26:48,493
- It's nothing personal.
- Fellers, listen.

1358
01:26:48,619 --> 01:26:52,622
I know what you're going through.
Everybody's been laughing at me too.

1359
01:26:53,832 --> 01:26:57,001
But becoming powerful and rich
beyond your wildest dreams

1360
01:26:57,086 --> 01:26:59,545
ain't gonna make you feel better.

1361
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:02,382
Yeah, but it's worth a shot.

1362
01:27:11,725 --> 01:27:12,892
Pit stop.

1363
01:27:17,147 --> 01:27:19,148
Not today, boys.

1364
01:27:28,742 --> 01:27:29,742
Retreat!

1365
01:27:32,663 --> 01:27:34,414
Thanks for the help, Corporal.

1366
01:27:34,498 --> 01:27:36,833
Anything for one of Pop's mates.

1367
01:27:42,965 --> 01:27:44,924
What's he saying? What's wrong?

1368
01:27:45,009 --> 01:27:47,010
None of his wrenches fit the bolts.

1369
01:27:49,346 --> 01:27:51,264
I get it. I get it!

1370
01:27:51,348 --> 01:27:53,683
- I know what needs to be done.
- Then do it!

1371
01:27:53,767 --> 01:27:55,935
What? No. I can't do it.

1372
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:57,979
Nobody takes me seriously.

1373
01:27:58,063 --> 01:28:01,190
I know that now.
This ain't Radiator Springs.

1374
01:28:01,275 --> 01:28:02,984
Yes, it is.

1375
01:28:03,235 --> 01:28:05,862
Look, you're yourself
in Radiator Springs.

1376
01:28:05,946 --> 01:28:07,905
Be yourself here.

1377
01:28:07,990 --> 01:28:09,949
And if people aren't taking you
seriously,

1378
01:28:10,034 --> 01:28:12,660
then they need to change, not you.

1379
01:28:12,745 --> 01:28:14,871
I know that
because I was wrong before.

1380
01:28:15,539 --> 01:28:17,540
Now, you can do this. You're the bomb.

1381
01:28:17,708 --> 01:28:19,292
Thanks, buddy.

1382
01:28:19,376 --> 01:28:21,878
No, you're the actual bomb.
Now, let's go!

1383
01:28:21,962 --> 01:28:23,963
Oh, right. Hang on!

1384
01:28:25,674 --> 01:28:27,675
Where's he going?

1385
01:28:29,303 --> 01:28:31,262
- Computer!
- Yes, Agent Mater?

1386
01:28:31,347 --> 01:28:34,223
I need that thing you done before
to get me away from McQueen!

1387
01:28:34,308 --> 01:28:35,558
Request acknowledged.

1388
01:28:39,063 --> 01:28:41,272
- Mater?
- Now I need you to do the chute!

1389
01:28:41,357 --> 01:28:43,316
The second kind, not the first!

1390
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:45,234
Deploying chute.

1391
01:29:08,967 --> 01:29:10,593
Who's winning the race?

1392
01:29:14,932 --> 01:29:17,350
- Back off! Back away!
- It's Lightning McQueen!

1393
01:29:17,434 --> 01:29:19,602
No, it's OK! Tell 'em, Mater. Explain.

1394
01:29:19,770 --> 01:29:21,270
Okay.

1395
01:29:21,355 --> 01:29:22,855
Somebody's been sabotaging

1396
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:25,233
the racers and hurtin' the cars,
and I know who.

1397
01:29:25,317 --> 01:29:27,068
Oh, wait. Your Majesty.

1398
01:29:27,152 --> 01:29:29,195
Bomb! It's a bomb!

1399
01:29:29,905 --> 01:29:32,407
- Everybody, down!
- Back up! Move it!

1400
01:29:34,618 --> 01:29:36,536
Get off the stage! Move it!

1401
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:39,580
Hold your fire! He can't disarm it!

1402
01:29:39,706 --> 01:29:43,042
Mater, I don't know what you're doing,
but stand down now.

1403
01:29:43,127 --> 01:29:45,878
This ain't nothing at all
like Radiator Springs.

1404
01:29:45,963 --> 01:29:47,922
Mater, just cut to the chase.

1405
01:29:48,006 --> 01:29:49,966
Okay. It's him.

1406
01:29:50,050 --> 01:29:53,094
What? Me? You've got to be crazy.

1407
01:29:53,178 --> 01:29:55,179
I figured it out when I realized

1408
01:29:55,264 --> 01:29:58,683
y'all attached this ticking time bomb
with Whitworth bolts...

1409
01:29:58,809 --> 01:30:02,770
the same bolts that hold together that
old British engine from the photograph.

1410
01:30:03,814 --> 01:30:04,814
- Holley! Show that picture.
- OK.

1411
01:30:05,274 --> 01:30:07,900
I remembered what they say
about old British engines:

1412
01:30:07,985 --> 01:30:10,653
If there ain't no oil under 'em,
there ain't no oil in 'em.

1413
01:30:10,779 --> 01:30:12,655
What is he talking about?

1414
01:30:12,823 --> 01:30:15,366
It was you leaking oil
at the party in Japan.

1415
01:30:15,451 --> 01:30:17,118
You just blamed it on me.

1416
01:30:17,202 --> 01:30:19,745
Electric cars don't use oil, you twit.

1417
01:30:19,830 --> 01:30:23,124
Then you're fakin' it.
You didn't convert to no electric.

1418
01:30:24,251 --> 01:30:27,128
If we pop that hood,
we'll see that engine from that picture.

1419
01:30:27,421 --> 01:30:30,214
This lorry's crazy!
He's going to kill us all!

1420
01:30:31,675 --> 01:30:32,842
Stay away!

1421
01:30:32,926 --> 01:30:36,804
But Sir Axlerod created the race.
Why would he want to hurt anyone?

1422
01:30:36,889 --> 01:30:40,433
To make allinol look bad so
everybody'd go back to using oil.

1423
01:30:40,517 --> 01:30:43,060
He said it himself
with that disguised voice.

1424
01:30:43,145 --> 01:30:47,190
Disguised voice? What are you
talking about? You're nuts, you are!

1425
01:30:47,274 --> 01:30:50,151
This is going nowhere fast.
We really should go, Grandmother.

1426
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:52,737
One moment, I'd like to see
where this is going.

1427
01:30:53,864 --> 01:30:55,698
Mater, he created allinol.

1428
01:30:55,824 --> 01:30:57,533
But what if he found that huge oil field

1429
01:30:57,618 --> 01:31:00,077
just as the world was trying to find
something else?

1430
01:31:00,204 --> 01:31:04,040
What if he came up with allinol
just to make alternative fuel look bad?

1431
01:31:04,124 --> 01:31:06,959
"What if?"
You're basing this on a "what if"?

1432
01:31:07,044 --> 01:31:09,170
- Okay, that's it.
- Lads, clear out.

1433
01:31:09,254 --> 01:31:12,381
Wait! Somebody save me!
The lorry's crazy!

1434
01:31:12,466 --> 01:31:14,300
- Keep away, you idiot!
- Mater!

1435
01:31:15,135 --> 01:31:17,678
- Mater!
- Someone do something!

1436
01:31:20,516 --> 01:31:22,350
You're insane, you are! Deactivate!

1437
01:31:24,436 --> 01:31:28,523
- Bomb deactivated.
- Have a nice day, Sir Axlerod.

1438
01:31:36,281 --> 01:31:39,158
- The engine from the photo.
- It's a perfect match.

1439
01:31:39,243 --> 01:31:41,410
How did the tow truck figure it out?

1440
01:31:41,787 --> 01:31:45,164
It's official. You're coming to
all my races from now on.

1441
01:31:45,249 --> 01:31:47,250
Now you're talkin'!

1442
01:31:50,587 --> 01:31:52,505
Hyeeugh!

1443
01:31:55,634 --> 01:31:57,927
Mater, let's go. You're on.

1444
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:04,684
Your Majesty, may I present

1445
01:32:04,768 --> 01:32:08,771
for the investiture of honorary
knighthood of the British Realm...

1446
01:32:08,939 --> 01:32:12,358
Tow Mater of Radiator Springs.

1447
01:32:12,442 --> 01:32:14,443
Go get 'em, buddy.

1448
01:32:21,994 --> 01:32:26,789
I hereby dub thee Sir Tow Mater.

1449
01:32:28,375 --> 01:32:31,669
Sir? Shoot, you can just call me Mater,
Your Majesty.

1450
01:32:31,753 --> 01:32:34,005
I don't wanna hear none of this "sir"
business.

1451
01:32:34,131 --> 01:32:36,132
By the way, have y'all met each other?

1452
01:32:36,216 --> 01:32:37,967
Queen, McQueen. McQueen, Queen.

1453
01:32:38,093 --> 01:32:40,928
McQueen, McMissile. McMissile,
McQueen. Queen, McMissile.

1454
01:32:45,976 --> 01:32:49,020
So there we was,
my rocket jets going full blast,

1455
01:32:49,104 --> 01:32:51,022
McQueen hanging on for dear life

1456
01:32:51,148 --> 01:32:55,109
when suddenly them two nasty lemons
come out of nowheres, guns drawed.

1457
01:32:55,193 --> 01:32:56,902
We was goners.

1458
01:32:56,987 --> 01:33:00,197
But then, out of nowhere
this beautiful spy car

1459
01:33:00,282 --> 01:33:02,283
swoops in from the sky to save us!

1460
01:33:02,534 --> 01:33:05,328
That's a very entertaining story,
young man.

1461
01:33:05,412 --> 01:33:07,371
Oh, Minny, please. Come on!

1462
01:33:07,497 --> 01:33:11,334
None of this happened.
Rocket jets, flying spy cars.

1463
01:33:11,418 --> 01:33:14,920
No, you're quite right.
It does sound a bit far-fetched.

1464
01:33:15,005 --> 01:33:16,839
Holley! What are you doin' here?

1465
01:33:16,923 --> 01:33:19,842
Hello, Mater!
It's so good to see you again.

1466
01:33:19,926 --> 01:33:20,926
Finn!

1467
01:33:21,011 --> 01:33:23,137
Our satellites picked up
an urgent communique.

1468
01:33:23,263 --> 01:33:24,972
So you got-a my email.

1469
01:33:25,057 --> 01:33:27,475
Y'all is going to have a great time!

1470
01:33:27,601 --> 01:33:31,437
Everybody, this here's Finn McMissile.
He's a secret agent.

1471
01:33:31,521 --> 01:33:32,688
Don't tell nobody.

1472
01:33:32,814 --> 01:33:34,774
And this is Holley Shiftwell.

1473
01:33:34,858 --> 01:33:36,859
- She's...
- I'm Mater's girlfriend.

1474
01:33:36,943 --> 01:33:38,903
It's so nice to meet you all.

1475
01:33:39,029 --> 01:33:41,197
Guido believe you now.

1476
01:33:41,323 --> 01:33:43,908
Whoa, honey.
You got a nasty dent there.

1477
01:33:44,034 --> 01:33:45,826
- Yeah.
- Was that from when you swooped in

1478
01:33:45,911 --> 01:33:47,745
and you saved them in London?

1479
01:33:47,871 --> 01:33:49,789
- Van!
- What? I'm just asking!

1480
01:33:49,915 --> 01:33:54,585
Don't you worry. My baby Ramone
can get that fixed up for you in no time.

1481
01:33:54,711 --> 01:33:57,755
Yeah, sure thing.
No problemo. Let me go get my tools.

1482
01:33:57,881 --> 01:34:00,674
Oh, no. I'm keeping that dent.
It's way too valuable.

1483
01:34:01,885 --> 01:34:06,097
A valuable dent?
She's as crazy as Mater.

1484
01:34:06,181 --> 01:34:07,973
Those two are perfect for each other.

1485
01:34:08,058 --> 01:34:10,559
There's one thing I still don't get.

1486
01:34:10,685 --> 01:34:13,479
The bad guys hit me with the beam
from the camera, right?

1487
01:34:13,563 --> 01:34:17,233
- So, why didn't I...
- Explode in a fiery inferno?

1488
01:34:17,359 --> 01:34:19,485
- Yeah.
- We couldn't figure that out, either.

1489
01:34:19,569 --> 01:34:22,571
Our investigation proved
that allinol was actually gasoline

1490
01:34:22,697 --> 01:34:25,991
and Axlerod engineered it so when it
got hit by the beam, it would explode.

1491
01:34:26,076 --> 01:34:30,162
Wait a second, Fillmore.
You said my fuel was safe!

1492
01:34:32,666 --> 01:34:37,753
If you're implying that I switched
that rot-gut excuse for alternative fuel

1493
01:34:37,879 --> 01:34:41,715
with my all-natural, sustainable,
organic biofuel

1494
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:47,179
just because I never trusted Axlerod,
you're dead wrong, man!

1495
01:34:47,264 --> 01:34:49,348
It was him!

1496
01:34:49,433 --> 01:34:53,477
Once big oil, always big oil, man.

1497
01:34:53,562 --> 01:34:54,979
Tree-hugger.

1498
01:34:55,897 --> 01:34:59,442
The Radiator Springs Grand Prix
is about to begin.

1499
01:34:59,526 --> 01:35:01,819
All spectators, clear the starting line.

1500
01:35:04,698 --> 01:35:07,199
I can't wait to get rockin'.
This is gonna be wicked!

1501
01:35:07,284 --> 01:35:08,909
We should do this every year.

1502
01:35:08,994 --> 01:35:12,121
Yeah, I just figured we never found out
who the world's fastest car is.

1503
01:35:12,205 --> 01:35:14,748
Plus, no press, no trophy, just racing.

1504
01:35:14,833 --> 01:35:18,461
- The way I like it.
- Francesco likes it like this, too.

1505
01:35:18,545 --> 01:35:22,131
- Francesco, I'd like you to meet...
- SignorinaSally.

1506
01:35:22,215 --> 01:35:23,549
It is official.

1507
01:35:23,633 --> 01:35:26,218
Lightning McQueen
is the luckiest car in the world.

1508
01:35:26,303 --> 01:35:28,429
Why, thank you.

1509
01:35:28,513 --> 01:35:31,599
Which he will have to be to have
a chance against Francesco today!

1510
01:35:31,683 --> 01:35:34,768
See you at the finish line, Mc...
What is that?

1511
01:35:34,978 --> 01:35:37,313
Just something I had made up
for the occasion.

1512
01:35:37,689 --> 01:35:39,690
Is-a good, McQueen. Very funny.

1513
01:35:39,774 --> 01:35:42,568
Was-a funnier when I did it,
but it's-a very funny.

1514
01:35:42,694 --> 01:35:45,905
What are you going to do next?
Are you going to take off your fenders?

1515
01:35:45,989 --> 01:35:47,740
Try it. You'll like it.

1516
01:35:47,824 --> 01:35:49,992
So, he's not so good-looking.

1517
01:35:50,118 --> 01:35:52,453
- Yeah. Nice try.
- I'm serious!

1518
01:35:52,537 --> 01:35:54,747
That's why I love you, Sally.

1519
01:35:54,831 --> 01:35:57,666
- Wish me luck!
- You don't need it!

1520
01:35:57,751 --> 01:36:01,587
Ooh-hm!
That Francesco is fine-looking!

1521
01:36:01,671 --> 01:36:03,214
And those open wheels.

1522
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:06,342
Ooh, I'm gonna have to go get myself
some coolant.

1523
01:36:17,729 --> 01:36:18,938
Go, Lightning!

1524
01:36:37,457 --> 01:36:39,124
- Go, Stickers!
- Right on, man!

1525
01:36:39,209 --> 01:36:41,168
- Go get 'em, tiger!
- Bravo, bravo!

1526
01:36:41,253 --> 01:36:44,630
- Go, Lightning, go!
- Go, McQueen! Whoo-hoo!

1527
01:36:44,714 --> 01:36:47,132
Finn? Time to go.

1528
01:36:47,217 --> 01:36:49,510
Siddeley's gassed, geared
and ready to fly.

1529
01:36:50,345 --> 01:36:53,514
- You're leavin' already?
- We've got another mission.

1530
01:36:53,598 --> 01:36:55,933
Just stopped by here
to pick something up.

1531
01:36:57,060 --> 01:37:00,729
Somethin' tells me you're not
talkin' about souvenir bumper stickers.

1532
01:37:00,855 --> 01:37:03,190
Her Majesty asked for you personally,
Mater.

1533
01:37:03,275 --> 01:37:06,652
- But I told y'all before, I'm not a spy.
- We know.

1534
01:37:06,736 --> 01:37:10,406
Spy or not, you're still the smartest,
most honest chap we've ever met.

1535
01:37:10,532 --> 01:37:13,867
- Don't forget massively charming.
- Well, thanks.

1536
01:37:13,952 --> 01:37:17,079
But as much fun as it was
hangin' with y'all, this...

1537
01:37:17,163 --> 01:37:19,832
This is home.

1538
01:37:19,916 --> 01:37:22,835
That's all right. We understand.
But I'll be back.

1539
01:37:22,919 --> 01:37:24,753
You still owe me that first date.

1540
01:37:24,879 --> 01:37:27,840
If there's ever anything I can do for you,
just let me know.

1541
01:37:27,924 --> 01:37:30,175
Well, I sure appreciate that. Thank you.

1542
01:37:31,511 --> 01:37:34,263
Actually, there is one thing.

1543
01:37:34,764 --> 01:37:37,099
Whoo-hoo!

1544
01:37:37,183 --> 01:37:39,143
Whoo! I'll be doggone!

1545
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:45,357
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1546
01:37:48,403 --> 01:37:49,945
Thanks, Mater!

1547
01:37:57,412 --> 01:37:59,413
Ha-ha-ha! Whoo!

1548
01:38:01,124 --> 01:38:03,000
Impossible!

1549
01:38:03,543 --> 01:38:05,002
- Ha-ha!
- Mater!

1550
01:38:05,128 --> 01:38:07,713
Check it out.
They let me keep the rockets.

1551
01:38:07,797 --> 01:38:09,882
I'll see you at the finish line, buddy!

1552
01:38:09,966 --> 01:38:11,925
Not if I see you first!

1553
01:38:12,010 --> 01:45:50,801
Yippee!
