1
00:01:06,056 --> 00:01:07,599
-Is he here yet?
-No.

2
00:01:07,807 --> 00:01:11,895
-You scared him.
-I gotta take a massive piss.

3
00:01:12,103 --> 00:01:15,648
Dude, any excuse for you
to pull that thing out.

4
00:01:31,247 --> 00:01:32,916
Anyone got any beer?

5
00:01:33,124 --> 00:01:38,129
We finished them all back at school.
Besides, you've had enough.

6
00:01:38,338 --> 00:01:42,217
I've got one. It's not cold,
but it's yours if you want it.

7
00:01:42,425 --> 00:01:46,846
All you gotta do is sit up, beg,
roll over and shake that booty.

8
00:01:47,055 --> 00:01:49,724
-Thanks a lot, Eric.
-Anytime, anywhere.

9
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:53,853
-This is gonna be sweet.
-I'm glad I thought of it.

10
00:01:54,062 --> 00:01:56,606
You're animals.
Just because he's new.

11
00:01:56,815 --> 00:02:00,652
You've talked shit the whole time.
Why don't you be quiet?

12
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:05,073
You know how it is.
Nobody's forcing him to show up.

13
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:09,786
What if he doesn't?
I want to go back to the dance.

14
00:02:09,994 --> 00:02:14,165
Belinda, why don't you go back
to the dance by yourself?

15
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,585
I wasn't talking to you, Dean.

16
00:02:17,794 --> 00:02:19,671
You know I don't dance.

17
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:23,550
It's true. I've seen him bust a move.
It ain't pretty.

18
00:02:23,758 --> 00:02:28,054
But a brother like me is ready
to get his freak on. What you say?

19
00:02:28,263 --> 00:02:30,640
Put it away before you hurt somebody.

20
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:33,226
Like yourself.

21
00:02:33,435 --> 00:02:34,686
He's here!

22
00:02:34,894 --> 00:02:37,480
All right, here he comes.

23
00:02:38,648 --> 00:02:41,651
Hey, check out the Safari Joe truck.

24
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,238
I can't wait to see you fly!

25
00:02:51,244 --> 00:02:53,788
Hey, nice shirt, Opie.

26
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,085
You're late.

27
00:02:59,294 --> 00:03:02,964
I thought I said be here at 10,
but you know....

28
00:03:03,173 --> 00:03:08,053
When I say be here at 10, be here.
Can you remember that next time?

29
00:03:10,138 --> 00:03:13,016
If there is a next time!

30
00:03:15,727 --> 00:03:18,688
Dean! Is he always like that?

31
00:03:18,897 --> 00:03:22,859
Always, man. So how about it?
You ready to fly?

32
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:25,570
Wait up, baby!

33
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:32,911
Let me get on your back.
Giddyap! Giddyap!

34
00:03:55,517 --> 00:03:57,435
Okay, here's the deal.

35
00:03:57,602 --> 00:04:01,231
You're gonna jump
from up there into here.

36
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,025
That's it, and you're one of us. Okay?

37
00:04:04,234 --> 00:04:06,444
-You ready?
-Yeah.

38
00:04:06,653 --> 00:04:09,406
All right. All right.

39
00:04:10,115 --> 00:04:12,200
Let's do this, okay?

40
00:04:18,248 --> 00:04:21,668
It's cake, man.
Hell, I'm jumping with you.

41
00:04:22,836 --> 00:04:25,839
-How deep is this?
-I don't really know.

42
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:27,590
Let's go find out.

43
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:32,512
Let's do it.

44
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,126
Yeah! Shit, yeah!

45
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,756
Come on, let's go!

46
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:09,424
Jump!

47
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:14,971
-You done this?
-We've all done it.

48
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:20,310
-I hope you had your Wheaties!
-You guys gonna do this tonight?

49
00:05:20,518 --> 00:05:22,395
On three.

50
00:05:23,146 --> 00:05:24,647
One.

51
00:05:24,856 --> 00:05:26,524
Two.

52
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:27,984
Three!

53
00:05:45,627 --> 00:05:46,961
Oh, shit.

54
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,506
Landon, he's hurt!

55
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:52,008
-Is he okay?
-Landon, get down here!

56
00:05:52,217 --> 00:05:54,511
-What the hell?
-Dean, what the hell?

57
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:57,055
-You guys, he's hurt!
-Come on, man!

58
00:05:57,263 --> 00:06:01,726
-I told you it was a bad idea!
-Get him out of the water!

59
00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:07,065
-Hurry up!
-Is he dead? What are we gonna do?

60
00:06:07,732 --> 00:06:09,692
Help me!

61
00:06:11,403 --> 00:06:16,116
-Get him over here!
-There's a pipe. He must have hit it!

62
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,411
Get him out of the water!

63
00:06:19,577 --> 00:06:22,330
Watch his head! Watch his head!

64
00:06:24,082 --> 00:06:25,917
Hey, who's down there?

65
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:28,378
Tracie, come on!

66
00:06:29,921 --> 00:06:33,258
Central, we've got trespassers.
Send a squad car.

67
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:35,468
Come on, Landon.

68
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:38,221
Come on!

69
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,473
You guys, just take him!

70
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:42,684
Give me his arms!

71
00:06:43,268 --> 00:06:44,769
I got him.

72
00:06:48,148 --> 00:06:50,567
We gotta get out of here.

73
00:06:52,152 --> 00:06:55,488
-Go! Get out of here!
-Landon, come on!

74
00:06:57,657 --> 00:07:00,368
I told you not to do this!

75
00:07:00,577 --> 00:07:02,078
Calm down.

76
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,376
Belinda, let's go!

77
00:07:10,712 --> 00:07:12,964
Come on, get in! I'm driving.

78
00:07:35,111 --> 00:07:36,488
Damn it!

79
00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:00,845
Shit!

80
00:08:27,872 --> 00:08:30,375
Put your hands on the wheel.

81
00:09:01,448 --> 00:09:03,992
You know, Mama,
my leg really hurts today.

82
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,870
I don't think I can go anyplace.

83
00:09:08,163 --> 00:09:12,125
-Maybe I should call your father.
-No.

84
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:14,586
I'm not talking to him.

85
00:09:14,794 --> 00:09:20,508
This has gotta stop between you two.
You can't do that. You need a father.

86
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:27,098
Let us be thankful today
that a life was saved by our Lord.

87
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:31,644
And let us pray for the lives
of the others involved...

88
00:09:31,853 --> 00:09:35,690
...who are clearly not
on the path of righteousness.

89
00:11:15,206 --> 00:11:18,209
-So how's the leg, man?
-It's good.

90
00:11:18,418 --> 00:11:20,628
I can't believe you were in jail.

91
00:11:20,837 --> 00:11:24,382
-What'd you tell them?
-It was a nice night for a drive.

92
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:28,011
Ended up at the cement factory,
found Gephardt.

93
00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:30,346
Tried to help him, got spooked.

94
00:11:30,555 --> 00:11:34,017
Figured I'd leave before
they thought I was involved.

95
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:38,563
Gotta hand it to you.
You're a Jedi Master of bullshit.

96
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,025
Damn, that Jamie Sullivan
sure has style.

97
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:44,527
Wore that dress in the fourth grade.

98
00:11:44,736 --> 00:11:47,322
It's the quiet ones you gotta watch.

99
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,533
She might put it on a brother
like a Pop-Tart.

100
00:11:50,742 --> 00:11:54,245
A little maintenance,
she might not look bad.

101
00:11:54,454 --> 00:11:56,206
Nice sweater.

102
00:11:56,414 --> 00:11:58,291
Thank you.

103
00:12:05,673 --> 00:12:07,425
Thank you.

104
00:12:21,106 --> 00:12:24,359
A student claims you were drinking
on school property.

105
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:27,237
Lucky for you,
Clay Gephardt isn't talking.

106
00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:32,409
The factory owners aren't pressing
charges. At least not today.

107
00:12:32,617 --> 00:12:35,453
I said I'd arrange
appropriate punishment.

108
00:12:35,662 --> 00:12:37,664
What, are you gonna expel me?

109
00:12:38,164 --> 00:12:39,624
Not yet.

110
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:46,089
Besides attending class, you will help
our janitorial staff after school.

111
00:12:46,297 --> 00:12:49,759
-For pay?
-For the inner satisfaction it brings.

112
00:12:50,802 --> 00:12:54,431
Saturdays, you'll tutor students
at our sister school.

113
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,892
You'll take part
in the drama club's final event.

114
00:12:58,101 --> 00:13:00,395
The spring play?

115
00:13:02,063 --> 00:13:04,482
It's time you experienced
other things.

116
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:08,570
Started spending time
with other kinds of people.

117
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,905
Don't blow it, Landon.

118
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:22,125
This is a device made of plastic wrap,
a coat hanger and Wite-Out.

119
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:26,129
-Does anyone know what it is?
-It's a star frame.

120
00:13:29,466 --> 00:13:31,134
This is a star frame.

121
00:13:31,342 --> 00:13:34,637
It will help you locate stars
with your naked eye.

122
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:40,769
Mercury and Jupiter can be seen just
over the west horizon after sunset.

123
00:13:40,977 --> 00:13:44,481
Bet you can see angels up there,
flying around.

124
00:13:44,689 --> 00:13:47,525
There are things that
could be called miraculous.

125
00:13:47,734 --> 00:13:52,405
The more Einstein studied the universe,
the more he believed in a higher power.

126
00:13:52,864 --> 00:13:55,909
Well, if there is a higher power...

127
00:13:56,076 --> 00:13:58,703
...why can't he get you a new sweater?

128
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:01,581
He's too busy looking for your brain.

129
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:05,919
Laugh, it's a joke.

130
00:14:06,127 --> 00:14:08,838
-Let's get out of here.
-I gotta stay.

131
00:14:09,047 --> 00:14:12,300
Principal's gone.
Let's make some moves.

132
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:14,594
Come on. Come on.

133
00:14:14,803 --> 00:14:18,431
I don't know.
The custodian thing kind of suits you.

134
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,684
Thanks, buddy. Thank you.

135
00:14:26,272 --> 00:14:29,234
Look at the chart,
you'll see Halley's comet.

136
00:14:32,821 --> 00:14:35,615
Okay, so I'll see you at school.

137
00:14:35,824 --> 00:14:39,035
My parents aren't home,
if you want to come inside.

138
00:14:40,704 --> 00:14:43,581
Come on, Belinda. Nothing's changed.

139
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:46,876
I know. I just thought....

140
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:48,628
It's over.

141
00:14:49,587 --> 00:14:52,716
Yeah. Whatever.

142
00:15:03,101 --> 00:15:04,936
Okay.

143
00:15:10,108 --> 00:15:12,068
Good morning, Landon.

144
00:15:12,277 --> 00:15:14,821
Landon, wake up!

145
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,866
Come on. Up, up, up, up!

146
00:15:19,284 --> 00:15:20,577
Up!

147
00:15:20,785 --> 00:15:22,704
It's Saturday, no school.

148
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,749
Tutoring.

149
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:46,478
Let's try this again.

150
00:15:46,853 --> 00:15:50,982
Which of these are similar triangles?
This one or that one?

151
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:53,193
What do you think?

152
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:56,279
Man, I think this is bullshit!

153
00:15:59,532 --> 00:16:01,785
Makes two of us.

154
00:16:25,308 --> 00:16:27,811
Do you wanna buy some raffle tickets?

155
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:32,065
I'm trying to raise money
to buy Jefferson new computers.

156
00:16:32,273 --> 00:16:34,025
No.

157
00:16:36,611 --> 00:16:39,781
So I saw you in there with Luis.

158
00:16:40,073 --> 00:16:42,575
And I know it can be difficult...

159
00:16:42,784 --> 00:16:46,371
...but maybe you should back
into it from somewhere else.

160
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,129
Are you gonna go visit Clay Gephardt?

161
00:16:57,382 --> 00:16:59,592
That would be a no.

162
00:17:00,969 --> 00:17:04,389
They moved him from the hospital
to a rehab place.

163
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,475
Is this your idea of small talk?

164
00:17:07,684 --> 00:17:11,438
If so, your social skills need work.
No one made him jump.

165
00:17:11,688 --> 00:17:14,441
-It's called peer pressure.
-How do you know?

166
00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:16,901
You read it in your precious book?

167
00:17:21,489 --> 00:17:24,993
Please don't pretend
like you know me, okay?

168
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:28,121
But I do. I do.

169
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:31,624
We have all the same classes
since kindergarten.

170
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:35,670
Why, you're Jamie Sullivan.
You sit at lunch table seven.

171
00:17:35,879 --> 00:17:40,633
It's not the reject table, but it's
definitely self-exile territory.

172
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:45,430
You have exactly one sweater.
You look at your feet when you walk.

173
00:17:45,638 --> 00:17:48,183
And for fun, you tutor on weekends...

174
00:17:48,391 --> 00:17:51,061
...and hang out
with the Stars and Planets kids.

175
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:52,854
How's that sound?

176
00:17:53,938 --> 00:17:58,818
Fairly predictable.
Nothing I haven't heard before.

177
00:17:59,027 --> 00:18:03,239
-You don't care what people think?
-No.

178
00:18:31,768 --> 00:18:35,980
I don't know what your problem is.
Miss Garber has nice hooters.

179
00:18:36,189 --> 00:18:39,818
This is bullshit. Thanks.

180
00:18:40,026 --> 00:18:44,239
I can't wait to see you in stage
makeup. That's gonna be cool.

181
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:48,201
-Be back in an hour.
-Tell them to do West Side Story.

182
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:54,541
Get that nice big-booty girl
from Selena. Maria! Maria!

183
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:59,879
This year's spring musical is about
fiery passion and blazing Tommy guns.

184
00:19:00,088 --> 00:19:05,385
Written by our own Eddie Zimmerhoff.
Words and music by Jamie Sullivan.

185
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:11,182
It tells the story of Tommy "The Gun"
Thornton in Prohibition-era New York.

186
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:12,851
Eddie, perhaps--

187
00:19:13,017 --> 00:19:16,604
Mr. Carter, better late than never.
Please join us.

188
00:19:16,813 --> 00:19:18,565
Sure.

189
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,944
Now then, let's see....

190
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:28,867
Jamie will be our Alicia,
a mysterious club singer.

191
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:33,121
-Sally will be playing Caroline.
-Congratulations.

192
00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:36,499
And Landon will read Tommy Thornton.

193
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:42,464
No. No. See, I didn't plan
on acting or anything.

194
00:19:42,672 --> 00:19:45,175
When did you know, Tommy?

195
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:47,802
lKnow what?

196
00:19:48,011 --> 00:19:50,388
That we were in love.

197
00:19:51,931 --> 00:19:53,892
Love?

198
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:00,106
Baby, you don't want to fall
in love with a guy like me.

199
00:20:00,315 --> 00:20:02,984
It's too late. I'm crazy about you.

200
00:20:03,193 --> 00:20:07,781
I'm breathing it, drinking it all in.
Aren't you?

201
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:15,246
I don't know what I'm drinking,
dollface, but if this is love...

202
00:20:15,455 --> 00:20:17,624
...pour me another glass.

203
00:20:17,832 --> 00:20:20,585
Are you trying to be bad at this?

204
00:20:20,794 --> 00:20:23,963
No, just comes naturally.

205
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:29,219
All right, everybody,
let's go to the end.

206
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,476
Don't even pretend you won't be great.

207
00:20:36,684 --> 00:20:40,605
-Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
-All right. See you.

208
00:20:43,817 --> 00:20:45,402
Bye.

209
00:20:52,242 --> 00:20:57,414
-So would it kill you to try?
-Yep, and I'm too young to die.

210
00:20:57,622 --> 00:21:00,792
You don't care about classes,
but you like school...

211
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,754
...because you're popular
and you'll never be on top again.

212
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:10,301
-That's thoroughly predictable.
-Your act only works on an audience.

213
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,002
Feeling Christian?

214
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,880
Seat belt?

215
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,362
-I forfeit.
-Thank you.

216
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,822
Forty-two.

217
00:22:13,323 --> 00:22:15,158
What do you mean, forty-two?

218
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:18,536
Forty-two is befriend somebody
I don't like.

219
00:22:20,705 --> 00:22:23,792
It's a to-do list I have for my life.

220
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,002
Like getting a new personality?

221
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:29,214
Join the Peace Corps,
make a medical discovery.

222
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:30,382
Ambitious.

223
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:34,302
Be in two places at once,
get a tattoo.

224
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:38,056
What's number one?

225
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:43,853
I'd tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

226
00:22:59,035 --> 00:22:59,869
I've come...

227
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,413
...to see if you're ready.

228
00:23:01,621 --> 00:23:05,583
Take a good look. The only thing
I'm ready for is a dirt nap.

229
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,586
Ready to look into your heart,
Tom Thornton.

230
00:23:08,795 --> 00:23:12,924
Your words have been heard,
and not just by me.

231
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:15,927
When you walked into....

232
00:23:17,721 --> 00:23:22,892
Shit. When you walked into my club,
that wasn't just a coincidence.

233
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,186
Nothing's coincidence, baby.

234
00:23:25,395 --> 00:23:29,024
You know you're the only one
who can make me sing.

235
00:23:29,232 --> 00:23:32,569
Yeah, Miss Garber!
You'll put Eric in all your plays!

236
00:23:32,777 --> 00:23:35,447
Eric, I'll put you in all my plays!

237
00:23:35,739 --> 00:23:39,617
Come on. Do you know I got
three weeks to memorize all this?

238
00:23:39,826 --> 00:23:44,330
You couldn't pull this off
in three months! De Niro couldn't!

239
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:46,124
I didn't write it, okay?

240
00:23:46,332 --> 00:23:50,920
But you're gonna make a jackass
of yourself in front of everyone.

241
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:55,550
Look, I don't have a choice,
so would you help me out, please?

242
00:23:57,677 --> 00:23:59,763
I'm just busting on you.

243
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:05,101
I'll be there opening night,
front row. And you can count on it.

244
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,645
With tomatoes.

245
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:09,856
Thanks, man.

246
00:24:10,065 --> 00:24:13,777
Landon? Boys, can you help
with these groceries?

247
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:15,987
-Yeah.
-No problem.

248
00:24:24,621 --> 00:24:26,331
Jamie.

249
00:24:27,832 --> 00:24:29,417
What do you want?

250
00:24:29,626 --> 00:24:34,339
I've known you for years. You've
never been the first to say hello.

251
00:24:35,423 --> 00:24:38,051
I need help with my lines.

252
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:43,765
-Landon Carter's asking me for help?
-Yeah.

253
00:24:43,973 --> 00:24:46,768
Okay, I'll pray for you.

254
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,978
Jamie, look--

255
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:53,483
You've obviously never asked anybody
for help before, right?

256
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:58,655
A request like yours requires
flattery and groveling.

257
00:24:58,863 --> 00:25:02,325
It can't be about you.
It has to be for the common good.

258
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:07,330
It is for the common good.
Eddie Zimmerhoff deserves the best.

259
00:25:08,623 --> 00:25:12,293
-Please?
-Okay. One condition, though.

260
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,170
What's that?

261
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:17,757
You have to promise
you won't fall in love with me.

262
00:25:21,302 --> 00:25:26,474
-That's not a problem.
-Okay. I'll see you today after school.

263
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:32,772
Landon Carter is coming here?

264
00:25:32,981 --> 00:25:36,192
He's dangerous, careless,
the worst kind of bully.

265
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:39,362
Daddy, what about forgiveness?

266
00:25:39,612 --> 00:25:43,074
I thought we had discussed
that I would decide...

267
00:25:43,283 --> 00:25:46,327
...how I wanted to spend
my time and my life.

268
00:25:46,536 --> 00:25:49,748
It's him I don't trust, not you.

269
00:26:02,218 --> 00:26:05,013
You gonna keep me out here
all afternoon?

270
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,182
Come on in.

271
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:16,566
My script is in my room. I'll be
right down. Make yourself at home.

272
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,777
Oh, yeah.

273
00:26:18,985 --> 00:26:21,196
It's not likely.

274
00:26:39,923 --> 00:26:42,050
That is one scary-looking--

275
00:26:42,675 --> 00:26:45,053
-Jesus!
-No, Jamie's father.

276
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:50,058
Hello, Mr. Carter. I understand
you're the lead in the play.

277
00:26:50,266 --> 00:26:51,976
Congratulations.

278
00:26:52,185 --> 00:26:55,146
Thanks for letting me
come over and run lines.

279
00:26:55,355 --> 00:26:57,440
I didn't let you.

280
00:26:58,274 --> 00:27:03,446
It's a school night. Let's get
one thing straight, Mr. Carter.

281
00:27:03,697 --> 00:27:09,327
You think that, on Sundays,
I don't see you from where I stand.

282
00:27:10,412 --> 00:27:12,539
But I see you.

283
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:18,461
I'll be in my office, just here.

284
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,629
Ready?

285
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:23,591
Yeah, let's go.

286
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:32,642
-Landon! Where have you been?
-Nowhere.

287
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:35,645
-Hey, come here.
-What's up?

288
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:39,149
-Are we cool?
-Yeah, sure.

289
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,211
What the hell?

290
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,605
-What are you doing here?
-I should ask you the same.

291
00:28:18,813 --> 00:28:22,525
Do you normally walk alone
in a cemetery at night?

292
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,152
Maybe.

293
00:28:24,861 --> 00:28:26,863
Where you going?

294
00:28:27,947 --> 00:28:29,908
Come and see.

295
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,875
Okay. What is that?

296
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:43,797
This is my telescope.
I built it when I was 12.

297
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:46,883
Take a look.

298
00:28:51,221 --> 00:28:54,641
Saturn. Very cool.

299
00:28:54,849 --> 00:29:00,105
I'm planning on building a larger one
so I can see the comet Hyakutake.

300
00:29:00,313 --> 00:29:04,192
It comes this spring.
Nobody knows when it'll be back.

301
00:29:04,401 --> 00:29:08,154
Nature's miracles. I get it.

302
00:29:08,363 --> 00:29:12,200
-Get what?
-That you're into all this stuff.

303
00:29:12,909 --> 00:29:14,911
This stuff?

304
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,499
I have my beliefs.
I have faith, but don't you?

305
00:29:19,666 --> 00:29:23,253
No. There's too much bad shit
in this world.

306
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,922
Without suffering,
there's no compassion.

307
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:28,800
Tell that to those who suffer.

308
00:29:30,885 --> 00:29:35,807
This is what I love about early
spring. Where those legs been hiding?

309
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:39,519
-She's trashy.
-Well, if it isn't the Virgin Mary.

310
00:29:40,186 --> 00:29:42,564
Here comes your leading lady.

311
00:29:42,772 --> 00:29:46,776
Hey, Carter.
So I'll see you after school?

312
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:49,821
ln your dreams.

313
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:03,835
Hi. Where's your sweater?

314
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:12,969
Let's get out of here.

315
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:16,014
What's up, dude?

316
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:47,712
Come on, Jamie.
Open the door, please!

317
00:30:49,589 --> 00:30:51,674
What do you want?

318
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:55,637
-You're not in a good mood.
-You don't miss a thing.

319
00:30:56,137 --> 00:30:59,849
Listen, I was hoping
we could run lines together.

320
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:03,186
Okay, but just not
so anybody knows, right?

321
00:31:03,686 --> 00:31:08,066
I just figured we could surprise
everyone with how good I get.

322
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:10,026
We could be secret friends.

323
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:14,030
Exactly! It's like
you're reading my mind.

324
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:17,659
Great. Maybe you could read mine?

325
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:25,041
Jamie, I can't just be your friend.

326
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:30,463
Landon, I thought I saw something
in you. Something good.

327
00:31:30,714 --> 00:31:33,174
But I was very wrong.

328
00:31:39,472 --> 00:31:41,391
Damn it!

329
00:31:45,854 --> 00:31:48,815
Sorry. Sorry.

330
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:27,645
You know the answer?

331
00:32:29,064 --> 00:32:31,483
Come on, man, I know you know.

332
00:32:38,907 --> 00:32:42,452
Okay. It's you, me and the basket.

333
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,246
We form the three corners
of a triangle.

334
00:32:45,455 --> 00:32:48,041
Take a step towards the basket.

335
00:32:50,585 --> 00:32:54,172
Am I at the same angle to you
and the basket as before?

336
00:32:54,381 --> 00:32:56,174
-Yeah.
-Are you?

337
00:32:56,383 --> 00:33:00,011
-Yeah.
-So, what did we just make?

338
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:07,560
-A similar triangle?
-Yes. Okay, make me an isosceles.

339
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:12,816
You got it, two sides the same.

340
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:15,777
Okay, enough of this. Let's play.

341
00:35:26,366 --> 00:35:29,119
I came to say I'm sorry.

342
00:35:31,621 --> 00:35:35,625
Well, you did. Feel better?

343
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:38,044
No. I feel like shit.

344
00:35:38,253 --> 00:35:43,216
You know what? I actually thought
I wanted to be your friend.

345
00:35:46,052 --> 00:35:50,432
And now I have no idea why. No idea.

346
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,270
I made that jump once.

347
00:35:55,812 --> 00:35:58,314
I thought I was a badass.

348
00:35:59,607 --> 00:36:04,738
I remember actually saying
that I meant to belly flop.

349
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:08,908
Did it hurt?

350
00:36:11,578 --> 00:36:13,538
Like hell.

351
00:36:14,581 --> 00:36:16,291
Good.

352
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:27,302
So I guess I'll see
you at school then.

353
00:36:32,182 --> 00:36:35,143
-Pour me a drink, Joey.
-You promised me, Tommy.

354
00:36:35,352 --> 00:36:38,521
No more of your no-goodnik schemes.

355
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,107
You promised me we'd go to Paris.

356
00:36:41,316 --> 00:36:45,070
I won't sit on my keister
and watch the fat cats get rich.

357
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:48,239
Trust me. This is a sure thing.

358
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:51,284
That's it! We are through!

359
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:54,454
Go ahead and run your booze,
you big dope!

360
00:36:54,662 --> 00:36:57,374
And I hope you drown in it!

361
00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:01,211
So you must be the new girl
he's hired.

362
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:04,172
The singer?

363
00:37:04,381 --> 00:37:09,177
You want some free advice
about this one? Stay far away.

364
00:37:09,386 --> 00:37:12,806
He's nothing but trouble
in cheap spats.

365
00:37:15,475 --> 00:37:18,561
Look, I ain't blaming you.

366
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,523
I ain't asking for forgiveness,
either.

367
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,859
I just did what I had to.

368
00:37:30,198 --> 00:37:35,120
When you walked out of the rain
and into my club...

369
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,957
...that wasn't just coincidence,
was it?

370
00:37:39,165 --> 00:37:41,334
Nothing's coincidence.

371
00:37:41,543 --> 00:37:46,047
Your face.... You look so familiar.

372
00:37:46,381 --> 00:37:50,927
Like this dame I knew once,
only it wasn't real, it was a dream.

373
00:37:51,177 --> 00:37:53,680
Tell me about this dream girl.

374
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,522
Well, I don't remember.

375
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:08,653
All I know...

376
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,035
...is you're beautiful.

377
00:38:24,377 --> 00:38:25,920
The song, the song.

378
00:38:26,421 --> 00:38:28,339
The dream.

379
00:38:30,091 --> 00:38:32,385
Help me to remember.

380
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,722
Will you sing for me?

381
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:42,719
That was great.

382
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:49,517
Hi, kids.

383
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:54,064
Honey, I couldn't believe it.
What a transformation.

384
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:55,899
Thanks, but please stop.

385
00:42:56,066 --> 00:42:58,568
-Don't be home too late.
-Okay. Thanks.

386
00:42:58,777 --> 00:43:01,029
Okay, okay.

387
00:43:01,905 --> 00:43:05,575
-lnteresting rewrite you did there.
-I did my best.

388
00:43:05,784 --> 00:43:08,161
Your acting didn't suck either.

389
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:11,956
-Gotta go. Take it easy, man.
-Okay.

390
00:43:12,165 --> 00:43:15,418
-Landon, you were marvelous!
-Thank you.

391
00:43:19,798 --> 00:43:22,300
Landon? Fine performance, son.

392
00:43:22,509 --> 00:43:26,388
-What are you doing here?
-I thought we'd get a bite.

393
00:43:26,596 --> 00:43:28,765
-I'm not hungry.
-Don't walk away.

394
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,767
You taught me how.

395
00:43:39,651 --> 00:43:41,736
Oh, my God.

396
00:43:42,028 --> 00:43:44,239
Look who's here.

397
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:50,662
Don't look at him.

398
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:53,456
You don't want to stare too much.

399
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:58,545
I guess he doesn't want
to sit with us.

400
00:44:12,308 --> 00:44:15,854
-People can see.
-That would ruin your reputation how?

401
00:44:16,021 --> 00:44:17,564
What's that?

402
00:44:19,524 --> 00:44:24,029
I'm reading books on Rothman's list
of contemporary American authors.

403
00:44:24,195 --> 00:44:28,742
-And how many books are there?
-A hundred.

404
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:33,788
But then there's his British list
and his European list.

405
00:44:33,997 --> 00:44:38,293
So is this on your list,
to read all these books?

406
00:44:44,758 --> 00:44:49,012
Jamie, I'm trying here, okay?

407
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,889
Maybe....

408
00:44:52,515 --> 00:44:56,186
Maybe I miss spending time with you.

409
00:44:56,394 --> 00:45:01,191
-Maybe you inspire me.
-Sounds like bull.

410
00:45:01,399 --> 00:45:03,109
-Which part?
-All of it.

411
00:45:03,318 --> 00:45:06,196
-It's not.
-Prove it.

412
00:45:14,245 --> 00:45:15,997
Jamie!

413
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,919
-You've no idea how to be a friend.
-I don't just want that.

414
00:45:21,086 --> 00:45:25,256
-You don't know what you want.
-You're scared someone wants you.

415
00:45:25,465 --> 00:45:29,761
-Why would that scare me?
-You couldn't hide behind books...

416
00:45:29,969 --> 00:45:33,765
...or your fricking telescope,
or your faith.

417
00:45:33,932 --> 00:45:37,227
No. You know the real reason
why you're scared?

418
00:45:37,394 --> 00:45:40,230
It's because you want
to be with me too.

419
00:46:00,792 --> 00:46:03,837
We gonna get this party jumping!

420
00:46:04,129 --> 00:46:08,007
Can you turn down Soul Train?
Some of us are trying to work.

421
00:46:08,216 --> 00:46:11,594
You really know how
to bust a robot's groove.

422
00:46:11,803 --> 00:46:16,433
It's all good because we'll get Club
Landon and Club Eric jumping now.

423
00:46:16,641 --> 00:46:19,310
What we got here?

424
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:24,733
Okay, okay, you're not feeling my
hip-hop, but what the hell is this?

425
00:46:25,108 --> 00:46:27,569
Jamie lent it to me.

426
00:46:27,777 --> 00:46:30,363
You're listening
to her people's music.

427
00:46:30,572 --> 00:46:32,157
-Her people?
-Yeah...

428
00:46:32,365 --> 00:46:36,828
...her Bible-hugging,
crucifix-wearing...

429
00:46:36,995 --> 00:46:39,831
...honk-if-you-love-Jesus people.

430
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,958
-She's not like that.
-Well...

431
00:46:42,125 --> 00:46:45,920
...you got Belinda thinking
that little lip action...

432
00:46:46,129 --> 00:46:48,965
...between you and Jamie
was kind of real.

433
00:46:55,847 --> 00:47:00,310
What's with you? You don't have time
for your real friends anymore.

434
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:04,647
I don't know, buddy. I'm just over it.

435
00:47:04,856 --> 00:47:08,485
I'm sick and tired of doing
the same shit all the time.

436
00:47:08,693 --> 00:47:12,906
This girl's changed you,
and you don't even know it, man.

437
00:47:13,114 --> 00:47:16,826
-Let me guess, Belinda say that too?
-No.

438
00:47:17,118 --> 00:47:18,787
I did.

439
00:47:30,548 --> 00:47:32,050
You.

440
00:47:32,217 --> 00:47:34,552
Me.

441
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:40,767
What is it?

442
00:47:40,975 --> 00:47:43,186
I got you something.

443
00:47:46,898 --> 00:47:48,817
Thank you.

444
00:47:52,112 --> 00:47:55,031
Well, I'll see you at school.

445
00:47:55,657 --> 00:47:57,325
Okay.

446
00:48:06,543 --> 00:48:09,963
-Mr. Carter.
-Later, Reverend.

447
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:34,362
Boys like that...

448
00:48:36,406 --> 00:48:38,324
...they have....

449
00:48:43,038 --> 00:48:45,749
They have expectations.

450
00:48:45,957 --> 00:48:49,544
The rules around here
aren't going to change.

451
00:48:49,753 --> 00:48:51,713
Fine.

452
00:48:55,759 --> 00:48:58,678
You might not care
what I say or think...

453
00:48:58,887 --> 00:49:01,848
...but you should care
about God's opinion.

454
00:49:02,724 --> 00:49:05,643
I think he wants me to be happy.

455
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:12,317
Dad, it's just a sweater.

456
00:49:12,525 --> 00:49:15,403
I'm going to make us
some dinner, okay?

457
00:49:26,873 --> 00:49:29,334
I talked to your dad today.

458
00:49:29,542 --> 00:49:34,381
Said he saw you at the play
for about 10 seconds.

459
00:49:34,589 --> 00:49:38,927
Sending a check once a month doesn't
exactly make him a father.

460
00:49:41,096 --> 00:49:45,767
-Landon, there are a lot of reasons--
-He left us.

461
00:49:46,935 --> 00:49:49,562
You need to forgive him too.

462
00:49:54,734 --> 00:49:59,322
Jamie Sullivan! Oh, me, oh, my,
look at Jamie Sullivan.

463
00:49:59,531 --> 00:50:03,243
She was looking all right
in that play.

464
00:50:03,451 --> 00:50:04,786
She doesn't look hot.

465
00:50:04,994 --> 00:50:10,250
Yeah, I would have to say during
the play, she looked hot.

466
00:50:10,458 --> 00:50:12,335
I have the best idea.

467
00:50:13,461 --> 00:50:16,756
Can you do something, like, move it?

468
00:50:17,132 --> 00:50:20,093
Maybe move it around
a little something here.

469
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,303
Take one.

470
00:50:25,807 --> 00:50:28,810
Let me stop it for a second.
Check it out.

471
00:50:31,187 --> 00:50:33,815
Hey, look at this.

472
00:50:34,024 --> 00:50:35,900
Here.

473
00:50:36,901 --> 00:50:39,237
Take one. Look.

474
00:50:43,867 --> 00:50:47,287
-Jamie. Hi.
-Hi.

475
00:50:47,495 --> 00:50:51,833
Listen, I just want you to know,
no hard feelings.

476
00:50:52,042 --> 00:50:55,211
Landon and I are way over.

477
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:58,715
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

478
00:51:02,677 --> 00:51:04,637
You'd be so beautiful...

479
00:51:04,846 --> 00:51:07,682
...if you knew how to do your makeup.

480
00:51:10,185 --> 00:51:12,645
-Come on, eat lunch with me.
-Okay.

481
00:51:12,854 --> 00:51:14,814
-Want a Tic Tac?
-No, thanks.

482
00:51:15,023 --> 00:51:16,524
Okay.

483
00:51:28,244 --> 00:51:29,913
Wow.

484
00:51:30,622 --> 00:51:32,582
Is that you?

485
00:51:38,213 --> 00:51:40,382
Nice bod.

486
00:52:08,576 --> 00:52:13,206
Look, this is about me, okay?
This is not you.

487
00:52:13,415 --> 00:52:15,417
Stay here.

488
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:22,507
Hey, man, no wonder you been
keeping her locked up.

489
00:52:22,716 --> 00:52:25,969
I had no idea this was
underneath all that.

490
00:52:28,263 --> 00:52:30,724
-Dean, stop!
-You stay out of this!

491
00:52:39,232 --> 00:52:42,652
-We're through. We're through.
-That's great.

492
00:52:42,819 --> 00:52:44,988
-We're through forever!
-You okay?

493
00:52:45,238 --> 00:52:47,741
-You made a mistake, Landon!
-You sure?

494
00:52:47,949 --> 00:52:49,743
Let's get out of here.

495
00:52:49,951 --> 00:52:52,412
Hey! You're a little chickenshit!

496
00:52:54,497 --> 00:52:57,709
Baby, I'm sorry. Okay?

497
00:52:57,917 --> 00:53:01,129
They're animals, all right?

498
00:53:01,337 --> 00:53:03,715
You want me to take you home?

499
00:53:05,967 --> 00:53:07,594
Let's get out of here.

500
00:53:08,803 --> 00:53:13,516
-Are you sure you're okay?
-I'm fine.

501
00:53:14,517 --> 00:53:18,772
-Thank you for everything.
-You're welcome.

502
00:53:24,694 --> 00:53:28,948
-I want to ask you something.
-Okay.

503
00:53:33,411 --> 00:53:37,707
Will you go out with me
on Saturday night?

504
00:53:40,835 --> 00:53:43,588
I'm sorry. I can't go.

505
00:53:47,342 --> 00:53:50,762
-You have something else going on?
-No.

506
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:55,225
-It's not that.
-Then what is it?

507
00:54:01,356 --> 00:54:03,608
I'm not allowed to date.

508
00:54:08,405 --> 00:54:12,909
"Do not be deceived.
God is not mocked.

509
00:54:14,911 --> 00:54:19,791
Whatever a man sows,
that he will also reap.

510
00:54:19,999 --> 00:54:24,754
For he who sows to his flesh,
will of the flesh reap--"

511
00:54:24,963 --> 00:54:27,799
-Can I help you?
-Yes, sir.

512
00:54:27,966 --> 00:54:31,720
I'd like to ask your daughter
to dinner on Saturday night.

513
00:54:32,012 --> 00:54:34,139
That's not possible.

514
00:54:36,307 --> 00:54:42,022
With all due respect, sir,
I ask you to reconsider.

515
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:46,651
With all due respect, Mr. Carter,
I made my decision.

516
00:54:48,653 --> 00:54:52,449
You can exit the way you entered.

517
00:54:56,995 --> 00:55:00,749
I'm sorry I haven't treated
Jamie the way I should have.

518
00:55:00,957 --> 00:55:03,626
She deserves more than that.

519
00:55:04,461 --> 00:55:07,172
I'm asking you for the same thing...

520
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:10,592
...you teach us every day in church.

521
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,262
And that's faith.

522
00:55:21,061 --> 00:55:23,480
I can't believe you asked permission.

523
00:55:23,646 --> 00:55:26,691
It's no big deal.
He was cool about it, anyway.

524
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,735
-Thank you.
-This is for you.

525
00:55:28,943 --> 00:55:32,697
-Thank you very much.
-Would you like something to drink?

526
00:55:32,906 --> 00:55:35,158
-Sweet tea, please.
-Make that two.

527
00:55:35,367 --> 00:55:37,077
Right away.

528
00:55:39,579 --> 00:55:42,749
This place is really nice.
Is this okay?

529
00:55:42,999 --> 00:55:45,752
-Don't even worry about it, okay?
-Okay.

530
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:48,254
Choose whatever you want.

531
00:55:48,963 --> 00:55:51,591
So, what'll it be?

532
00:55:52,592 --> 00:55:54,803
Is everything okay?

533
00:55:55,428 --> 00:55:59,099
-Thank you very much.
-Yeah, me too. Thanks.

534
00:56:05,897 --> 00:56:08,191
Would you like to dance?

535
00:56:09,818 --> 00:56:13,113
Sorry, I don't dance.

536
00:56:13,321 --> 00:56:17,117
Me neither. I mean, not usually
in front of anybody.

537
00:56:17,826 --> 00:56:23,123
Well, no. I mean, I don't at all.
As in, I can't.

538
00:56:23,331 --> 00:56:26,084
Everybody can dance.

539
00:56:26,292 --> 00:56:29,087
Come on, you can't be that bad.

540
00:56:30,255 --> 00:56:32,132
Please?

541
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:34,467
For me?

542
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,470
Come on.

543
00:56:51,985 --> 00:56:56,531
Sorry, I told you I was bad at this.

544
00:56:56,740 --> 00:57:00,994
-ln all fairness, you warned me, right?
-That's right.

545
00:57:05,373 --> 00:57:08,668
So, what's number one on your list?

546
00:57:10,837 --> 00:57:13,256
Okay.

547
00:57:13,465 --> 00:57:17,969
Number one on my list
is getting out of Beaufort.

548
00:57:19,596 --> 00:57:22,140
Getting out won't be your problem.

549
00:57:22,349 --> 00:57:26,895
It's more like figuring out what to do
when you get somewhere.

550
00:57:27,103 --> 00:57:29,022
What do you mean?

551
00:57:31,066 --> 00:57:33,860
I mean, you can do anything.

552
00:57:51,086 --> 00:57:55,048
-Where are we going?
-Just hold on, you'll see.

553
00:57:58,885 --> 00:58:01,846
Come on, come on. Let's go!

554
00:58:02,097 --> 00:58:04,849
-What are we doing?
-Run!

555
00:58:05,058 --> 00:58:08,311
-Okay, okay. Stand there.
-All right.

556
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:12,440
-One foot there, and one foot here.
-Okay.

557
00:58:14,567 --> 00:58:17,529
You're acting crazy. What's going on?

558
00:58:17,737 --> 00:58:20,990
Right now, you're straddling
the state line.

559
00:58:22,659 --> 00:58:24,411
Okay.

560
00:58:27,038 --> 00:58:29,749
You're in two places at once.

561
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:46,307
Okay, butterfly, rosebud or star?

562
00:58:46,516 --> 00:58:48,518
You choose.

563
00:58:50,603 --> 00:58:53,231
-Butterfly.
-Okay.

564
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:00,363
Where do you want it?

565
00:59:03,742 --> 00:59:05,618
Right here.

566
00:59:13,209 --> 00:59:15,128
Okay.

567
01:00:21,945 --> 01:00:25,782
How can you see places like this...

568
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:30,829
...and have moments like this,
and not believe?

569
01:00:32,747 --> 01:00:35,333
You're lucky to be so sure.

570
01:00:39,796 --> 01:00:42,090
It's like the wind.

571
01:00:42,465 --> 01:00:47,387
I can't see it, but I feel it.

572
01:00:47,595 --> 01:00:49,681
What do you feel?

573
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:57,063
I feel wonder and beauty...

574
01:00:57,272 --> 01:01:01,067
...joy, love.

575
01:01:02,527 --> 01:01:06,239
I mean, it's the center of everything.

576
01:01:09,784 --> 01:01:12,078
I might kiss you.

577
01:01:14,414 --> 01:01:16,708
I might be bad at it.

578
01:01:20,128 --> 01:01:22,589
That's not possible.

579
01:01:46,988 --> 01:01:49,074
I love you.

580
01:02:02,045 --> 01:02:06,466
Now would be the time
to say something.

581
01:02:09,052 --> 01:02:12,555
I told you not to fall in love with me.

582
01:03:19,789 --> 01:03:24,044
Jamie. Say good night to Mr. Carter.

583
01:03:25,712 --> 01:03:28,798
Landon, go home. The night's over.

584
01:03:29,007 --> 01:03:30,717
-Good night.
-Good night.

585
01:03:30,884 --> 01:03:32,802
Good night, sir.

586
01:03:36,264 --> 01:03:39,726
Jamie, your behavior's sinful.

587
01:03:41,102 --> 01:03:45,607
-You act with that boy like you're--
-ln love?

588
01:03:45,815 --> 01:03:50,111
-Jamie, you are a child.
-Dad, look at me...

589
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:53,907
-...I'm not a child.
-Then stop acting childish.

590
01:03:57,619 --> 01:03:59,496
I love him.

591
01:04:02,290 --> 01:04:06,669
Then be fair to him, Jamie,
before things get worse.

592
01:04:28,108 --> 01:04:30,568
-Hey.
-Hey.

593
01:04:32,821 --> 01:04:35,740
-Will you help me?
-Yeah.

594
01:04:35,949 --> 01:04:38,868
So, what did you tell your father?

595
01:04:39,077 --> 01:04:43,039
The truth. I just left you out of it.

596
01:04:44,124 --> 01:04:46,292
So, what do you want to see?

597
01:04:47,127 --> 01:04:48,753
Pluto.

598
01:04:49,003 --> 01:04:52,465
Pluto only rises a few minutes
before the sun.

599
01:04:52,674 --> 01:04:54,509
Right...

600
01:04:55,593 --> 01:04:59,764
...and I have brought us
a thermos of hot coffee...

601
01:05:02,350 --> 01:05:04,644
...and a blanket.

602
01:05:04,853 --> 01:05:08,690
-You planned this.
-Oh, I hoped for it.

603
01:05:11,026 --> 01:05:13,069
Are you trying to seduce me?

604
01:05:13,278 --> 01:05:16,489
Why? Are you seducible?

605
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:21,661
That's what I thought...

606
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:24,497
...ergo, a second blanket.

607
01:05:24,706 --> 01:05:28,710
-One for me, and one for you.
-Thank you.

608
01:05:40,555 --> 01:05:45,769
-Can you find this star right here?
-Sure.

609
01:05:55,695 --> 01:05:59,240
So why am I looking for this star?

610
01:06:00,241 --> 01:06:02,952
Because I had it named for you.

611
01:06:05,121 --> 01:06:06,790
See?

612
01:06:07,582 --> 01:06:09,459
It's official.

613
01:06:10,043 --> 01:06:14,506
It's from the lnternational
Star Registry.

614
01:06:18,051 --> 01:06:20,303
This is wonderful!

615
01:06:25,225 --> 01:06:27,268
I love you.

616
01:06:40,198 --> 01:06:44,160
Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm stopping.

617
01:06:52,919 --> 01:06:56,756
So, what's your number one?

618
01:07:00,885 --> 01:07:04,556
To marry in the church
where my mother grew up.

619
01:07:04,764 --> 01:07:07,600
That's where my parents were married.

620
01:07:37,005 --> 01:07:40,633
-Did you just get in?
-Yeah.

621
01:07:41,009 --> 01:07:44,262
Thank heavens I didn't know.
I'd have been panicked.

622
01:07:44,471 --> 01:07:46,139
Sorry.

623
01:07:46,931 --> 01:07:51,311
Landon, were you with Jamie?

624
01:07:51,478 --> 01:07:54,856
Landon, be careful.
She's the reverend's daughter.

625
01:07:55,065 --> 01:07:57,525
-Mom--
-Please!

626
01:07:57,901 --> 01:07:59,819
It's different with her.

627
01:08:00,111 --> 01:08:03,490
-It's different with her.
-Yes.

628
01:08:05,867 --> 01:08:08,536
It better be different with her.

629
01:08:10,872 --> 01:08:15,668
I was doing laundry the other day,
and I found this.

630
01:08:23,468 --> 01:08:26,388
"Examine a moon rock.

631
01:08:27,722 --> 01:08:29,933
Go to college.

632
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,853
Get into medical school."

633
01:08:37,565 --> 01:08:43,863
Honey, these are really
beautiful ambitions.

634
01:08:44,072 --> 01:08:50,578
-But you'll have to work really hard.
-I can do that.

635
01:08:53,665 --> 01:08:55,417
Yeah, you can.

636
01:08:59,921 --> 01:09:02,132
Mama...

637
01:09:02,841 --> 01:09:05,969
...Jamie has faith in me.

638
01:09:07,554 --> 01:09:09,097
You know?

639
01:09:09,806 --> 01:09:14,019
She makes me want to be different.

640
01:09:14,936 --> 01:09:16,896
Better.

641
01:09:18,106 --> 01:09:21,985
I was so drunk,
I don't remember anything.

642
01:09:26,906 --> 01:09:30,994
That's great.
Citizen high to citizen low.

643
01:09:32,996 --> 01:09:37,042
Are you worried
about your college applications?

644
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:38,710
No.

645
01:09:39,753 --> 01:09:41,421
I'm not applying.

646
01:09:41,629 --> 01:09:45,425
-I thought you said--
-No, you assumed.

647
01:09:45,633 --> 01:09:50,055
-Take a year off, try the Peace Corps?
-No.

648
01:09:51,973 --> 01:09:54,267
What are you gonna do?

649
01:09:57,729 --> 01:09:59,606
I'm sick.

650
01:09:59,814 --> 01:10:03,526
-I'll take you home, you'll be--
-No, Landon!

651
01:10:04,361 --> 01:10:05,820
I'm sick.

652
01:10:09,783 --> 01:10:12,285
I have leukemia.

653
01:10:17,791 --> 01:10:19,292
No.

654
01:10:20,168 --> 01:10:22,962
-You're 18, you're perfect.
-No.

655
01:10:23,171 --> 01:10:27,801
I found out two years ago.
I've stopped responding to treatments.

656
01:10:32,597 --> 01:10:34,974
So why didn't you tell me?

657
01:10:35,183 --> 01:10:39,479
The doctor said I should live life
normally, as best I could.

658
01:10:39,688 --> 01:10:43,066
I didn't want anybody
to be weird around me.

659
01:10:43,233 --> 01:10:46,528
-lncluding me?
-Especially you!

660
01:10:49,489 --> 01:10:54,536
I was getting along fine.
I accepted it, and then you happened!

661
01:10:58,873 --> 01:11:03,211
I do not need a reason
to be angry with God.

662
01:12:11,696 --> 01:12:14,282
Dad, open the door!

663
01:12:24,626 --> 01:12:26,127
Landon?

664
01:12:27,671 --> 01:12:30,590
-I need your help.
-What's wrong? You okay?

665
01:12:30,799 --> 01:12:34,260
It's my girlfriend, Jamie. She's....

666
01:12:36,096 --> 01:12:41,351
She's got cancer. And I need you
to come and see her right now.

667
01:12:41,518 --> 01:12:43,269
Okay, calm down.

668
01:12:43,436 --> 01:12:47,023
-Can you help me or not?
-I don't know her case.

669
01:12:47,232 --> 01:12:51,319
I don't know her history.
I'm a cardiologist. I can't--

670
01:12:51,528 --> 01:12:56,074
You know, just forget it. I knew it.

671
01:12:56,282 --> 01:12:59,619
Would you wait? Landon, wait!

672
01:14:37,592 --> 01:14:40,178
Your mom called me.

673
01:14:41,262 --> 01:14:43,598
Talk to me, man.

674
01:14:43,848 --> 01:14:46,017
About what?

675
01:14:48,311 --> 01:14:50,188
About you...

676
01:14:50,397 --> 01:14:52,482
...about Jamie.

677
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:58,363
What's there to talk about?

678
01:15:00,198 --> 01:15:03,326
She's the best person I've ever known.

679
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:10,250
I didn't understand.

680
01:15:15,505 --> 01:15:17,757
It's okay, man.

681
01:15:19,175 --> 01:15:21,136
It's okay.

682
01:15:42,991 --> 01:15:48,163
It's so nice to see you again.
You're welcome. Watch yourself now.

683
01:15:51,082 --> 01:15:53,460
I'm not going anywhere.

684
01:15:53,793 --> 01:15:56,296
Please tell Jamie that.

685
01:16:25,617 --> 01:16:30,830
I'm so sorry.
I really should have told you sooner.

686
01:16:31,039 --> 01:16:33,124
I made you do too many things--

687
01:16:33,333 --> 01:16:36,544
If anything,
you kept me healthy longer.

688
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:48,098
Are you scared?

689
01:16:49,182 --> 01:16:50,642
To death.

690
01:16:54,104 --> 01:16:55,980
Lighten up.

691
01:16:56,189 --> 01:16:58,441
It's not funny.

692
01:17:19,546 --> 01:17:22,716
I'm scared of not being with you.

693
01:17:26,469 --> 01:17:29,472
Oh, baby, that will never happen.

694
01:17:39,107 --> 01:17:40,442
I'll be here.

695
01:17:43,570 --> 01:17:44,904
Mom.

696
01:17:47,407 --> 01:17:49,534
Can you do me a favor?

697
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,295
So I talked to Eric.

698
01:19:30,969 --> 01:19:33,596
Need some help with this stuff?

699
01:19:34,139 --> 01:19:35,640
Sure.

700
01:20:13,261 --> 01:20:15,930
What's that boy doing in the yard?

701
01:20:18,975 --> 01:20:21,978
What's the matter? Jamie, honey?

702
01:21:28,044 --> 01:21:32,465
Landon. Run along, son.

703
01:21:32,674 --> 01:21:34,968
I'm not tired.

704
01:21:36,428 --> 01:21:39,389
I need just a minute with her.

705
01:21:47,397 --> 01:21:51,192
-I'll be back, okay?
-Okay.

706
01:22:15,008 --> 01:22:17,010
Daddy...

707
01:22:18,345 --> 01:22:20,555
...so serious.

708
01:22:30,607 --> 01:22:36,613
Do you remember
when you were about 5 or 6...

709
01:22:36,863 --> 01:22:40,075
...and you said you hated gravity...

710
01:22:40,283 --> 01:22:43,703
...and you wanted
to jump off the roof and fly?

711
01:22:45,997 --> 01:22:50,627
I was so angry at you
for making me come down.

712
01:22:50,835 --> 01:22:56,216
Honey, if I kept you too close, it's
because I wanted to keep you longer.

713
01:22:57,384 --> 01:22:59,052
Dad....

714
01:23:03,473 --> 01:23:07,644
You know, when I lost your mother...

715
01:23:12,649 --> 01:23:16,945
...I was afraid that my heart
would never open again.

716
01:23:24,911 --> 01:23:28,456
Jamie, I couldn't look
at you for days.

717
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,880
But then....

718
01:23:40,301 --> 01:23:43,638
I love you so much.

719
01:24:11,166 --> 01:24:13,752
I wanted to give you these.

720
01:24:14,127 --> 01:24:16,921
The pictures from the play.

721
01:24:23,178 --> 01:24:26,556
-I'm sorry about the flyers.
-It doesn't matter.

722
01:24:30,352 --> 01:24:33,521
I guess you're with who you should be.

723
01:24:34,856 --> 01:24:37,067
It's like she chose you.

724
01:24:38,401 --> 01:24:41,696
Yeah, I don't even know why.

725
01:24:44,449 --> 01:24:46,409
I do.

726
01:25:26,449 --> 01:25:28,201
How you feeling?

727
01:25:28,368 --> 01:25:31,996
-I'm okay. How are you?
-Pretty good.

728
01:25:32,205 --> 01:25:35,208
-I have something for you.
-You do?

729
01:25:40,505 --> 01:25:43,758
Don't worry, it's not a Bible.

730
01:25:44,134 --> 01:25:49,556
It was my mother's. It's got quotes
from her favorite books...

731
01:25:50,849 --> 01:25:54,436
...and quotes by famous people.
Her thoughts.

732
01:25:56,354 --> 01:26:00,650
-Come on.
-Okay, let's check it out.

733
01:26:08,324 --> 01:26:10,410
"What is a friend?

734
01:26:10,618 --> 01:26:16,124
It's a single soul dwelling
in two bodies. Aristotle."

735
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,919
-Right here.
-Okay.

736
01:26:20,545 --> 01:26:23,048
"Find out who you are...

737
01:26:23,256 --> 01:26:26,134
...and do it on purpose."

738
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:29,095
That's Dolly Parton.

739
01:26:30,597 --> 01:26:33,266
I always thought she was smart.

740
01:26:43,276 --> 01:26:49,157
"Love is always patient and kind.
It is never jealous.

741
01:26:49,783 --> 01:26:53,620
Love is never boastful or conceited.

742
01:26:53,995 --> 01:26:57,582
It is never rude or selfish.

743
01:26:57,791 --> 01:27:02,921
It does not take offense
and is not resentful."

744
01:27:11,763 --> 01:27:15,058
-You know what I figured out today?
-What?

745
01:27:18,978 --> 01:27:21,648
Maybe God...

746
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:27,195
...has a bigger plan for me
than I had for myself.

747
01:27:28,571 --> 01:27:33,243
Like, this journey never ends.

748
01:27:35,161 --> 01:27:39,374
Like, you were sent to me
because I'm sick.

749
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:45,380
To help me through all this.

750
01:27:56,599 --> 01:27:59,019
You're my angel.

751
01:28:16,786 --> 01:28:18,079
What's going on?

752
01:28:18,288 --> 01:28:23,168
I get to go home.
Please thank your father for me.

753
01:28:23,376 --> 01:28:27,255
-What does she mean?
-He's been trying to reach you.

754
01:28:27,464 --> 01:28:31,092
He's going to pay
for private home care.

755
01:29:00,664 --> 01:29:02,540
Thank you.

756
01:29:22,519 --> 01:29:24,521
Sorry.

757
01:29:26,606 --> 01:29:29,484
It's all right, son.

758
01:30:05,687 --> 01:30:11,067
-I gotta finish this tonight.
-Here, something hot.

759
01:30:13,445 --> 01:30:16,448
Almost finished.
Did you order the mirrors?

760
01:30:16,656 --> 01:30:19,284
-Yeah, they're in here.
-Good.

761
01:30:19,492 --> 01:30:23,455
-What about side bearings?
-An old phonographic turntable.

762
01:30:23,663 --> 01:30:27,375
So you think you can get
all this done by tomorrow?

763
01:30:29,502 --> 01:30:32,672
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

764
01:30:33,006 --> 01:30:35,050
It's beautiful.

765
01:30:35,258 --> 01:30:38,136
Okay, it's time. Go check it out.

766
01:31:18,551 --> 01:31:19,928
There it is.

767
01:31:22,806 --> 01:31:26,226
Come here. Come look.

768
01:31:28,311 --> 01:31:31,231
Come here. Come look, quick.

769
01:31:40,532 --> 01:31:42,742
That is cool.

770
01:31:52,585 --> 01:31:54,087
Do you love me?

771
01:32:01,553 --> 01:32:06,307
-Will you do something for me then?
-Anything.

772
01:32:09,352 --> 01:32:11,855
Will you marry me?

773
01:33:36,022 --> 01:33:42,404
"Love is always patient and kind.
It is never jealous."

774
01:33:42,612 --> 01:33:47,867
-I love you.
-"Love is never boastful nor conceited.

775
01:33:48,034 --> 01:33:50,578
It is never rude or selfish.

776
01:33:50,787 --> 01:33:55,625
It does not take offense
and is not resentful.

777
01:33:55,834 --> 01:34:00,213
Love takes no pleasure
in other people's sins...

778
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:04,342
...but delights in the truth.

779
01:34:04,551 --> 01:34:09,889
It is always ready to excuse,
to trust, to hope...

780
01:34:10,098 --> 01:34:12,684
...and to endure...

781
01:34:14,060 --> 01:34:16,146
...whatever comes."

782
01:34:16,938 --> 01:34:21,317
-I, Landon Rollins Carter...
-I, Jamie Elizabeth Sullivan...

783
01:34:21,526 --> 01:34:23,903
...do solemnly swear...

784
01:34:24,070 --> 01:34:28,199
-...to take Jamie Sullivan...
-...to take Landon Rollins Carter...

785
01:34:28,408 --> 01:34:30,577
-...as my wife.
-...as my husband.

786
01:34:30,785 --> 01:34:36,750
To honor and to cherish her,
all the days of my life.

787
01:34:56,519 --> 01:35:00,231
Jamie and I had a perfect
summer together...

788
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:05,195
...with more love than lots of people
know in a lifetime.

789
01:35:05,403 --> 01:35:09,908
And then she went,
with her unfailing faith.

790
01:35:32,472 --> 01:35:35,058
It's been four years...

791
01:35:36,142 --> 01:35:39,854
...but the vision of Jamie
walking towards me...

792
01:35:41,147 --> 01:35:44,109
...will stay with me forever.

Hello, Mr. Carter. Come in.

794
01:35:55,370 --> 01:35:58,665
-Have a seat, please.
-Thank you.

795
01:36:05,755 --> 01:36:07,298
Landon.

796
01:36:11,302 --> 01:36:14,014
-You look good.
-Thank you. You too.

797
01:36:14,222 --> 01:36:16,391
I'm getting by.

798
01:36:27,777 --> 01:36:32,490
-What's new, Landon?
-Well, I got into medical school.

799
01:36:32,699 --> 01:36:34,826
Your mother told me that.

800
01:36:35,660 --> 01:36:40,665
We're so proud of you. Jamie would
have been proud of you too.

801
01:36:43,376 --> 01:36:45,378
Listen.

802
01:36:50,967 --> 01:36:55,680
I want you to have this.

803
01:36:56,139 --> 01:36:58,433
Oh, Landon.

804
01:37:04,481 --> 01:37:06,483
Oh, my.

805
01:37:09,402 --> 01:37:10,445
Thank you.

806
01:37:15,075 --> 01:37:18,328
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.

807
01:37:23,416 --> 01:37:24,918
She did.

808
01:37:27,128 --> 01:37:29,130
It was you.

809
01:37:38,056 --> 01:37:41,101
Jamie saved my life.

810
01:37:41,768 --> 01:37:44,604
She taught me everything.

811
01:37:44,979 --> 01:37:48,358
About life, hope...

812
01:37:48,566 --> 01:37:51,277
...and the long journey ahead.

813
01:37:52,696 --> 01:37:55,115
I'll always miss her.

814
01:37:56,449 --> 01:38:00,662
But our love is like the wind.

815
01:38:02,455 --> 01:38:04,874
I can't see it...

816
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:07,544
...but I can feel it.
