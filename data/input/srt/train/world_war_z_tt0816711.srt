1
00:01:43,355 --> 00:01:45,403
This is J.T.L. Morning News.

2
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:47,443
This is Holly Chadwick.

3
00:01:47,515 --> 00:01:48,641
Thanks for joining us.

4
00:01:48,715 --> 00:01:51,400
We have a great show
in store for you this morning.

5
00:01:51,475 --> 00:01:54,126
Well, it's a great morning
to be in the studio.

6
00:01:54,195 --> 00:01:56,402
Authorities have confirmed
an avian flu outbreak.

7
00:01:56,475 --> 00:01:57,840
Forecast, cloudy skies...

8
00:01:57,915 --> 00:01:59,917
Good morning. Reporting from Brighton.

9
00:02:01,315 --> 00:02:03,044
This will be a different scenario

10
00:02:03,115 --> 00:02:06,483
if the virus changes in a way that allows
transmission between humans.

11
00:02:06,555 --> 00:02:07,636
So, let's get started.

12
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:10,921
Yet again today,

13
00:02:10,995 --> 00:02:14,044
another group of dolphins
became stranded.

14
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:17,045
CO2 emissions have
dramatically increased in...

15
00:02:17,235 --> 00:02:19,124
Are there any
real threats that you know of?

16
00:02:19,235 --> 00:02:20,441
Not at all.

17
00:02:20,995 --> 00:02:22,201
Environmentalists are trying

18
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,686
to determine the cause of death.

19
00:02:23,795 --> 00:02:25,479
At alert level six,

20
00:02:25,555 --> 00:02:27,637
W.H.O. guidelines for governments...

21
00:02:27,715 --> 00:02:30,036
Your socks are so cute! I like them.

22
00:02:30,115 --> 00:02:31,560
Police say they've seen
similar cases recently

23
00:02:32,115 --> 00:02:33,685
of people behaving strangely.

24
00:02:33,755 --> 00:02:36,156
The U.N. health agency is not likely

25
00:02:36,235 --> 00:02:38,636
to recommend official travel restrictions.

26
00:02:38,755 --> 00:02:40,439
It's a little bit unsettling.

27
00:02:40,515 --> 00:02:42,995
They're not physicists.
They're not engineers.

28
00:02:43,075 --> 00:02:44,361
They think it's just gonna go away.

29
00:02:44,435 --> 00:02:45,925
They live in a fantasy parallel universe.

30
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:49,596
Right on top of the man, beating him.

31
00:02:49,675 --> 00:02:50,836
The man is bleeding.

32
00:02:50,915 --> 00:02:52,246
Twenty-one confirmed cases.

33
00:02:52,315 --> 00:02:55,637
All the talk
about a doomsday is a big hoax.

34
00:02:55,795 --> 00:02:57,126
The subject growled at him

35
00:02:57,195 --> 00:02:59,243
and continued to maul the victim.

36
00:02:59,315 --> 00:03:02,637
The best estimate
is about 15,000 in the U.K.

37
00:03:02,755 --> 00:03:03,995
We don't know if this is spreading.

38
00:03:04,115 --> 00:03:05,446
Rhythms of change...

39
00:03:05,515 --> 00:03:07,517
So far there's no manifestation.

40
00:03:10,595 --> 00:03:13,565
Monitors have arrived,
even carrying them...

41
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:14,876
With that much
public at risk, we cannot...

42
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:17,959
They're trying to move us on,
trying to tell the journalists to get out.

43
00:03:34,115 --> 00:03:35,276
Wake up!

44
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,925
Oh, creatures in our bed...

45
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:41,681
No sleeping!

46
00:03:42,995 --> 00:03:44,565
Oh, you're getting very big.

47
00:03:44,635 --> 00:03:47,559
- What do you want to eat?
- Pancakes!

48
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,006
We got a lot more sunshine today.

49
00:03:50,155 --> 00:03:52,476
You have to only say one word.

50
00:03:52,995 --> 00:03:55,157
Hey, by the way,
what do you want for your birthday?

51
00:03:55,355 --> 00:03:56,402
Say a PUPPY-

52
00:03:56,515 --> 00:03:57,562
A PUPPY-

53
00:03:57,635 --> 00:03:59,399
You mean a stuffed animal puppy?

54
00:03:59,475 --> 00:04:01,000
Because that we can do.

55
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:06,157
Good morning. That looks yummy.

56
00:04:07,035 --> 00:04:08,719
She gets the bigger one?

57
00:04:08,835 --> 00:04:10,405
- Yeah, sorry.
- She's tiny.

58
00:04:10,515 --> 00:04:12,358
Did you pack your inhaler?

59
00:04:13,555 --> 00:04:14,681
Bathroom sink.

60
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,076
- In a minute?
- Scootch! Go.

61
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,763
The government
has declared martial law.

62
00:04:19,835 --> 00:04:21,599
Daddy, what's martial law?

63
00:04:23,715 --> 00:04:27,197
Martial law is like house rules,
but for everybody.

64
00:04:27,995 --> 00:04:31,556
Were you ever
in places like that with your old job?

65
00:04:33,395 --> 00:04:35,636
But I quit my old job
so I could be with you.

66
00:04:35,915 --> 00:04:36,962
Do you miss it?

67
00:04:41,195 --> 00:04:42,401
No, I like my new job.

68
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:45,200
All you do is make pancakes
in the morning!

69
00:04:45,315 --> 00:04:46,521
Yeah, but I'm really good at it.

70
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,400
Look who I found!

71
00:04:48,995 --> 00:04:50,326
Here comes the number 12 train!

72
00:04:50,395 --> 00:04:51,760
It's not Subway Sam, is it?

73
00:04:52,315 --> 00:04:54,556
You want more pancakes?

74
00:04:55,155 --> 00:04:56,520
Good.

75
00:04:56,675 --> 00:04:58,962
Go, go, go. Come on, scootch!

76
00:04:59,035 --> 00:05:00,799
- At least. ..
- Move it on out.

77
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,764
Hey! Plates in the sink!

78
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:03,996
- Later!
- Do that when we get back!

79
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,363
Does it live in the jungle?

80
00:05:16,435 --> 00:05:17,436
No.

81
00:05:17,515 --> 00:05:18,801
Do you eat it on Sundays?

82
00:05:18,915 --> 00:05:19,962
No.

83
00:05:20,075 --> 00:05:22,919
Does it live
on the Great Plains of Africa?

84
00:05:23,395 --> 00:05:25,523
- Yeah.
- Oh, well, I guess, yeah.

85
00:05:25,595 --> 00:05:28,917
Do people keep it in pens all its
life and harvest it for meat?

86
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,599
- That's really gross!
- Gross!

87
00:05:30,675 --> 00:05:31,722
Dad!

88
00:05:31,795 --> 00:05:33,957
Is it an animal you'd have for a pet?

89
00:05:34,075 --> 00:05:35,600
- Yes.
- Is it a cat?

90
00:05:35,715 --> 00:05:36,955
Yes.

91
00:05:37,235 --> 00:05:38,885
- Okay, now we have another one.
- Do another one.

92
00:05:39,235 --> 00:05:41,078
You totally got one!

93
00:05:41,195 --> 00:05:42,356
Why are there so many?

94
00:05:42,435 --> 00:05:44,085
It's like, three in the last five minutes.

95
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,835
What is going on?

96
00:05:51,755 --> 00:05:53,280
The World Health Organization has been

97
00:05:53,355 --> 00:05:55,164
tracking the recent outbreak of rabies

98
00:05:55,235 --> 00:05:59,001
that began in Taiwan and has now been
reported in over 12 countries.

99
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:02,124
Responding to allegations he hasn't
done enough to prevent the spread...

100
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:03,606
Can we try BBC?

101
00:06:04,475 --> 00:06:06,318
You're not British anymore, baby.

102
00:06:06,395 --> 00:06:07,965
You lost your accent a long time ago.

103
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:10,403
Except after two bottles of wine.

104
00:06:10,515 --> 00:06:11,721
Am I British?

105
00:06:11,795 --> 00:06:13,001
Yeah, your grandma is.

106
00:06:14,795 --> 00:06:15,956
Hey!

107
00:06:17,955 --> 00:06:19,445
He's just gonna keep going, Daddy?

108
00:06:19,515 --> 00:06:20,516
Hold on, guys.

109
00:06:20,635 --> 00:06:21,682
Daddy, be careful on the road.

110
00:06:21,795 --> 00:06:23,445
It's okay, baby.

111
00:06:27,795 --> 00:06:29,445
Can be transmitted between species

112
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:31,836
commonly from a bite
from an infected animal.

113
00:06:37,195 --> 00:06:40,165
Our best recommendation is to stay
away from densely populated areas.

114
00:06:40,435 --> 00:06:42,005
Hey, yo! You all right?

115
00:06:42,075 --> 00:06:43,281
Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks.

116
00:06:43,355 --> 00:06:45,596
- You need anything?
- No. You know what's going on?

117
00:06:45,675 --> 00:06:47,165
No, man, I don't know anything.

118
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:48,640
It's crazy.

119
00:06:52,795 --> 00:06:53,956
Gerry?

120
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:02,156
Get back in your car right now!

121
00:07:03,515 --> 00:07:05,165
Remain with your ve...

122
00:07:12,155 --> 00:07:13,156
What are we doing?

123
00:07:13,235 --> 00:07:14,396
That's our way out of here.

124
00:07:36,035 --> 00:07:37,719
I want my blanket!

125
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:38,876
Baby, it's packed right now.

126
00:07:38,955 --> 00:07:40,320
Snuggle with Subway Sam, okay?

127
00:07:44,995 --> 00:07:46,440
My blanket!

128
00:07:53,915 --> 00:07:54,916
Rach?

129
00:07:54,995 --> 00:07:57,077
Rachel, baby, you've got
to get back in your seat.

130
00:07:57,995 --> 00:07:59,599
- Baby, we need you in your seat.
- Put your belt on!

131
00:07:59,675 --> 00:08:00,915
Rachel, right now!

132
00:08:01,075 --> 00:08:02,804
- Gerry?
- Rach, get your belt back on!

133
00:08:14,755 --> 00:08:16,086
- You Okay?
- You Okay?

134
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,004
- Rachel, sweetheart?
- Rachel, you hurt?

135
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,003
- Connie?
- Are you okay? It's okay.

136
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:26,556
We should get out.

137
00:08:26,635 --> 00:08:27,966
Everybody out of the car.

138
00:08:37,235 --> 00:08:39,317
We've got to get out of the city.

139
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,563
Her door won't open!
Rachel, go out that side.

140
00:08:45,755 --> 00:08:48,201
Okay, you have to climb over, honey.

141
00:08:48,275 --> 00:08:49,720
Out of the way!

142
00:08:51,555 --> 00:08:52,795
Move it!

143
00:08:57,675 --> 00:08:59,120
Come on, honey. Come on.

144
00:09:01,435 --> 00:09:03,278
Sweetheart, are you okay?

145
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:36,757
Let's go. Let's get off the street.

146
00:09:46,715 --> 00:09:48,240
What is that, Gerry? What is that?

147
00:09:48,315 --> 00:09:49,521
I don't know!

148
00:09:50,075 --> 00:09:51,440
Get to the RV.

149
00:09:51,515 --> 00:09:52,562
Subway Sam!

150
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:55,479
Here comes the number 12 train! One.

151
00:09:57,355 --> 00:09:58,402
Two.

152
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:01,037
- What's happening?
- Three.

153
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:02,922
Four.

154
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:05,595
Five.

155
00:10:06,595 --> 00:10:07,960
Six.

156
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,401
Seven.

157
00:10:10,475 --> 00:10:11,476
Eight.

158
00:10:12,595 --> 00:10:13,881
Nine.

159
00:10:14,595 --> 00:10:16,006
Ten.

160
00:10:16,715 --> 00:10:18,205
Eleven.

161
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,241
Twelve.

162
00:10:22,515 --> 00:10:24,199
Train's in the station!

163
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,115
Gerry!

164
00:10:49,555 --> 00:10:51,205
Watch out!

165
00:11:30,715 --> 00:11:33,446
We're pulling back on Fifth Street!

166
00:11:33,515 --> 00:11:35,165
Containment is a fail.

167
00:11:48,195 --> 00:11:49,924
Try to relax.

168
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:51,800
Give yourself air.

169
00:11:52,235 --> 00:11:53,646
In and out.

170
00:11:54,275 --> 00:11:56,801
Come on, baby, try to relax.

171
00:11:57,355 --> 00:11:59,881
Gerry? We left my purse in the car.

172
00:11:59,955 --> 00:12:01,161
Where's her spare?

173
00:12:01,915 --> 00:12:04,805
I'm gonna go check
your backpack, all right?

174
00:12:05,155 --> 00:12:07,203
Do you want to be with her?

175
00:12:15,155 --> 00:12:17,635
Rach, you'll be all right.
You're gonna be all right.

176
00:12:17,835 --> 00:12:20,076
Hey, hey, you breathe
through your nose.

177
00:12:20,635 --> 00:12:22,842
Rach, Rach, look at me. Look at me.

178
00:12:23,675 --> 00:12:25,165
You're gonna be all right.

179
00:12:25,835 --> 00:12:27,997
You've done this a hundred times.
Look at me. Look at me.

180
00:12:28,435 --> 00:12:31,120
Breathe in through your nose,
out through your mouth.

181
00:12:33,115 --> 00:12:34,276
Okay, we're gonna go to a pharmacy.

182
00:12:34,355 --> 00:12:36,005
We gotta move.

183
00:12:37,915 --> 00:12:39,121
Okay.

184
00:12:39,995 --> 00:12:41,520
Good. Good. Look.

185
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:44,475
Look at me, look at me.
Rach, breathe through your nose.

186
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,920
No, no, no, no...

187
00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:47,565
You're gonna be all right.

188
00:12:47,635 --> 00:12:48,921
- Look at me.
- Daddy, what are those things?

189
00:12:49,475 --> 00:12:51,557
Honey, find us some water.
Okay? Something to drink.

190
00:12:57,115 --> 00:12:58,162
It's Thierry.

191
00:12:58,355 --> 00:12:59,402
Where are you?

192
00:13:00,075 --> 00:13:02,362
Airborne. Lower East Side to Turtle Bay.

193
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,157
It's all gone. We barely made it out.

194
00:13:06,235 --> 00:13:08,522
- Tell him to go south.
- No, no, we need visual confirmation.

195
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,166
No,no,no,no,no,no,no.

196
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:12,436
What is this?

197
00:13:12,555 --> 00:13:14,045
We don't know. How close were you?

198
00:13:14,515 --> 00:13:15,562
Face to face.

199
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:17,040
Good, honey, good.

200
00:13:18,955 --> 00:13:20,116
Daddy.

201
00:13:20,755 --> 00:13:22,484
Connie, give me that.

202
00:13:22,555 --> 00:13:24,045
Give me that. Oh, thank you, honey.

203
00:13:24,355 --> 00:13:25,436
Where are you?

204
00:13:25,515 --> 00:13:26,801
95, heading north.

205
00:13:27,995 --> 00:13:29,884
Okay. Okay.

206
00:13:30,115 --> 00:13:33,198
All right.
We'll try to get a helicopter to you.

207
00:13:33,275 --> 00:13:35,277
I'll call you back with an extraction point.

208
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,483
Can you hold out for another hour?

209
00:13:37,555 --> 00:13:39,080
Do we have a choice?

210
00:13:39,155 --> 00:13:40,839
This is not
for old time's sake, my friend.

211
00:13:41,075 --> 00:13:42,281
I'll need you.

212
00:13:42,635 --> 00:13:44,239
I need you back.

213
00:13:44,395 --> 00:13:45,442
Don't forget about us.

214
00:13:45,515 --> 00:13:47,005
What do you mean, we've lost Boston?

215
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:48,565
All right. Good luck, Gerry.

216
00:13:49,675 --> 00:13:50,722
Okay.

217
00:13:50,795 --> 00:13:53,799
Good, honey. Keep it going.
It's gonna be all right.

218
00:14:06,755 --> 00:14:08,962
- Come here. Stay close.
- Super close.

219
00:14:09,035 --> 00:14:10,605
Take my hand.

220
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,563
Get her medicine,
I'll get us something to eat.

221
00:14:15,635 --> 00:14:17,558
I'll meet you back here.

222
00:14:34,355 --> 00:14:36,039
Stay close, honey.

223
00:14:50,795 --> 00:14:52,365
What do you need?

224
00:14:53,955 --> 00:14:55,002
Albuterol.

225
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,516
They outgrow the asthma supposedly.

226
00:15:14,115 --> 00:15:16,277
And this shit, too. It's magic for my kid.

227
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:19,519
Thank you.

228
00:15:24,035 --> 00:15:26,163
- Daddy!
- Connie?

229
00:15:27,155 --> 00:15:28,441
Daddy!

230
00:15:28,515 --> 00:15:30,483
- Connie?
- Daddy!

231
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:31,961
- Where's Mommy?
- Gerry!

232
00:15:32,555 --> 00:15:33,886
Gerry!

233
00:15:34,115 --> 00:15:35,276
Kaﬂn?

234
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:37,883
- Karin?
- Gerry! Gerry!

235
00:15:38,035 --> 00:15:40,561
Get off of me!
Get off of me! That's all I have.

236
00:15:40,675 --> 00:15:42,200
- Gerry!
- Hey!

237
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:45,518
- Hey!
- Gerry.

238
00:16:03,475 --> 00:16:05,796
Multiple 11-99s at Washington Park.

239
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,640
Please, send units.
We're falling back on Reed Street.

240
00:16:08,795 --> 00:16:10,638
Two Robert 12, units need backup.

241
00:16:10,715 --> 00:16:12,638
Mobile ops is down. Please respond.

242
00:16:12,715 --> 00:16:14,285
Two Robert 12, are you there? Copy.

243
00:16:14,395 --> 00:16:15,840
- Girls!
- Responders, Code 3, Code 3.

244
00:16:15,915 --> 00:16:18,077
Rachel, quick, come on.

245
00:16:24,675 --> 00:16:25,881
No.

246
00:16:26,755 --> 00:16:27,881
No!

247
00:16:28,395 --> 00:16:30,921
We got to get out of here.
We got to get off the street.

248
00:16:30,995 --> 00:16:32,076
Gerry.

249
00:16:32,595 --> 00:16:33,960
Apartments?

250
00:16:35,915 --> 00:16:37,246
Hey. Yeah.

251
00:16:45,075 --> 00:16:46,759
- Gerry?
- We're in Newark.

252
00:16:46,835 --> 00:16:48,166
We're stranded.

253
00:16:48,235 --> 00:16:49,839
Apartment buildings, 23rd.

254
00:16:49,915 --> 00:16:52,156
If we can get to the roof,
can you get someone to us?

255
00:16:52,275 --> 00:16:53,606
- Not tonight.
- When?

256
00:16:53,755 --> 00:16:54,802
The earliest would be sunrise.

257
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:55,882
Sunrise.

258
00:16:55,955 --> 00:16:57,400
Tell him I got flares.

259
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,603
We'll be on the roof with flares.

260
00:16:59,675 --> 00:17:02,121
Listen, Gerry, I will move
mountains to get you out here.

261
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:12,526
Come here, baby.

262
00:17:19,315 --> 00:17:20,999
Go! Go! Go!

263
00:17:23,195 --> 00:17:24,959
- Baby, in here!
- Come on. Quick!

264
00:17:25,595 --> 00:17:26,676
Gerry!

265
00:17:36,075 --> 00:17:37,361
Inside, girls!

266
00:17:37,435 --> 00:17:39,324
By the stairs. Inside, inside!

267
00:17:40,955 --> 00:17:42,798
Wait!

268
00:17:44,755 --> 00:17:45,756
Wait.

269
00:17:48,355 --> 00:17:49,686
Up, up. It's okay, baby.

270
00:17:53,075 --> 00:17:54,964
Run! Run! Go, Rachel!

271
00:17:55,035 --> 00:17:57,515
Go!

272
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,360
Keep running, baby.

273
00:18:00,835 --> 00:18:02,803
-It's all right.
- To the top.

274
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,161
Go! Go!

275
00:18:13,555 --> 00:18:14,556
Go!

276
00:18:29,035 --> 00:18:30,036
Run!

277
00:18:37,555 --> 00:18:39,205
Go! Go! Go! Go!

278
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,275
I need a new flare!

279
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:44,003
This asshole's about to get through!

280
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,877
Where's Connie? Connie?

281
00:18:56,195 --> 00:18:57,720
- Connie?
- Connie!

282
00:18:57,995 --> 00:18:59,963
- Let me in!
- Connie!

283
00:19:12,155 --> 00:19:14,203
- Baby?
-It's not her. It's not her.

284
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,604
- Let me in!
- Connie!

285
00:19:16,675 --> 00:19:18,006
Let me in!

286
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:24,884
In, in, in! In!

287
00:19:33,235 --> 00:19:34,521
Thank you so much.

288
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,518
- I'm Tomas.
- Hey, Tomas.

289
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,723
My mom's cooking everything
before it starts to stink.

290
00:19:42,035 --> 00:19:43,196
That's smart.

291
00:19:43,275 --> 00:19:44,401
You guys all right?

292
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:45,601
It's all right.

293
00:19:46,195 --> 00:19:47,526
It's okay.

294
00:19:48,795 --> 00:19:50,160
Are you guys hungry?

295
00:19:50,235 --> 00:19:51,600
Yes, thank you.

296
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:17,241
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

297
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,001
Thank you.

298
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,240
You want some juice?

299
00:20:22,315 --> 00:20:23,316
The following message

300
00:20:23,395 --> 00:20:26,956
is transmitted at the request of the
New Jersey State Police Department.

301
00:20:27,715 --> 00:20:30,241
Authorities recommend
that the following actions

302
00:20:30,315 --> 00:20:32,158
should be taken by
all the members of the public.

303
00:20:33,075 --> 00:20:34,918
Stay indoors if at all possible.

304
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,003
Have enough food
and water supplies for sheltering

305
00:20:39,075 --> 00:20:40,884
for one to two weeks.

306
00:20:41,235 --> 00:20:43,602
The following message
is transmitted at the request

307
00:20:43,715 --> 00:20:45,843
of the New Jersey State
Police Department.

308
00:20:46,435 --> 00:20:48,802
An unidentified virus strain is rapidly

309
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,923
spreading across
the state of New Jersey.

310
00:21:35,195 --> 00:21:36,356
She was crying.

311
00:21:42,955 --> 00:21:44,480
Thanks, Tommy.

312
00:21:45,995 --> 00:21:48,680
I used to work in dangerous places

313
00:21:48,755 --> 00:21:51,838
and people who moved survived,
and those who didn't...

314
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:57,321
Movement is life.

315
00:21:59,795 --> 00:22:02,560
You have a better chance
if you come with us.

316
00:22:12,275 --> 00:22:14,277
You need anything else
before you leave?

317
00:22:57,995 --> 00:23:00,316
Okay. Come on. Come on.

318
00:23:25,235 --> 00:23:26,725
We should have left with them.

319
00:23:26,835 --> 00:23:28,121
There is nowhere to go.

320
00:23:28,195 --> 00:23:30,163
What's going to happen
when the food is gone?

321
00:23:38,155 --> 00:23:39,919
Okay, come on.

322
00:23:43,475 --> 00:23:44,840
I'm scared.

323
00:23:45,155 --> 00:23:48,204
Connie, there's a helicopter
waiting for us on the roof.

324
00:23:48,315 --> 00:23:50,921
Keep your eyes
on Mommy and Daddy, okay?

325
00:23:51,115 --> 00:23:52,355
Be ninja quiet.

326
00:23:52,915 --> 00:23:54,838
Just a walk in the park.

327
00:23:55,675 --> 00:23:57,518
How do we know they're coming?

328
00:23:57,955 --> 00:23:59,445
They're coming.

329
00:23:59,515 --> 00:24:00,516
Ready?

330
00:24:16,715 --> 00:24:18,365
Okay, come on, guys.

331
00:24:23,115 --> 00:24:24,640
Come on! Come on!

332
00:24:26,635 --> 00:24:27,716
Up, up, Up.

333
00:24:28,115 --> 00:24:29,321
Come on, baby.

334
00:24:29,515 --> 00:24:31,005
Go, go, go!

335
00:24:32,115 --> 00:24:34,277
- Come on, baby!
- Go, go!

336
00:24:34,475 --> 00:24:36,557
Go, girls! Gerry!

337
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,115
Come on. Gerry!

338
00:24:39,195 --> 00:24:40,606
Girls, get back!

339
00:24:42,115 --> 00:24:43,799
Watch out!

340
00:24:54,435 --> 00:24:56,324
- Go!
- GO! Go!

341
00:24:56,515 --> 00:24:58,165
Come on, faster, girls!

342
00:25:01,275 --> 00:25:03,277
Lieutenant, I've got no contact.

343
00:25:03,355 --> 00:25:05,119
I say again, no contact.

344
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:07,240
Let's go, let's go!

345
00:25:09,435 --> 00:25:10,596
Karin!

346
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,040
- Karin!
- Yeah.

347
00:25:13,315 --> 00:25:14,601
Go through the door!

348
00:25:17,435 --> 00:25:18,596
Gerry?

349
00:25:56,115 --> 00:25:58,038
There they are!
Ace, we have positive contact.

350
00:25:58,155 --> 00:25:59,805
That's our target! Get us down!

351
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:00,956
Daddy!

352
00:26:01,115 --> 00:26:02,924
- Daddy!
- Baby, get back.

353
00:26:03,155 --> 00:26:04,486
Daddy!

354
00:26:04,555 --> 00:26:05,556
Gerry?

355
00:26:05,635 --> 00:26:07,239
- Gerry, what?
- Stay back!

356
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:08,726
Baby! No!

357
00:26:08,795 --> 00:26:10,160
One thousand seven.

358
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,725
One thousand eight.

359
00:26:11,835 --> 00:26:13,485
Daddy, get off the edge!

360
00:26:13,555 --> 00:26:16,001
- Gerry, please?
- One thousand ten.

361
00:26:17,915 --> 00:26:19,679
One thousand eleven.

362
00:26:25,435 --> 00:26:27,119
I got it in my mouth.

363
00:26:27,395 --> 00:26:29,636
You're okay. You're okay.

364
00:26:32,235 --> 00:26:33,361
Go! Go!

365
00:26:36,315 --> 00:26:37,726
Come on. Come on.

366
00:26:46,195 --> 00:26:47,356
Let's go! Let's go!

367
00:26:47,635 --> 00:26:49,478
Come on, let's go! We got to go!

368
00:26:53,915 --> 00:26:55,076
You got her?

369
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:09,684
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

370
00:27:32,475 --> 00:27:35,319
Traffic en route, altitude 5-7 thousand.

371
00:27:35,395 --> 00:27:39,002
Heading 250. Turn right,
heading 075, once clear.

372
00:27:39,915 --> 00:27:41,679
Remain below 4, 000.

373
00:27:56,155 --> 00:28:00,479
Clear to land,
heading 040, wind 060 at five.

374
00:28:03,235 --> 00:28:05,681
Follow L.S.O. directions.
Prep for immediate dust off.

375
00:28:28,195 --> 00:28:29,401
Gerry.

376
00:28:29,595 --> 00:28:30,960
Thank you.

377
00:28:31,035 --> 00:28:33,037
Good to see you, my friend.

378
00:28:33,115 --> 00:28:34,879
Tango five, this is Argus command.

379
00:28:34,955 --> 00:28:36,116
Cleared for take-off.

380
00:28:36,395 --> 00:28:38,318
Tango five. Wilco.

381
00:28:57,275 --> 00:28:58,515
Karin, to the right.

382
00:28:58,755 --> 00:29:00,325
This is good, right?

383
00:29:00,395 --> 00:29:02,079
Bunk beds!

384
00:29:02,155 --> 00:29:05,125
Your bunk beds
are number two, three and six.

385
00:29:05,435 --> 00:29:06,675
Please make yourself at home.

386
00:29:06,755 --> 00:29:08,166
You want to get up here?

387
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:11,759
- There you go, sweetheart.
- That's good.

388
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:13,644
We're not dropping anchor again.

389
00:29:14,115 --> 00:29:15,241
You're safe.

390
00:29:15,315 --> 00:29:16,441
It's not me I'm worried about.

391
00:29:16,515 --> 00:29:17,960
They're safe.

392
00:29:18,635 --> 00:29:20,000
Baby-

393
00:29:21,355 --> 00:29:23,881
It's bigger than
our old apartment on 72nd.

394
00:29:25,115 --> 00:29:26,321
Need anything, Karin?

395
00:29:26,835 --> 00:29:27,882
Water.

396
00:29:28,555 --> 00:29:29,602
I'll organize.

397
00:29:31,355 --> 00:29:33,756
Is this worldwide?
Is anyone doing better than we are?

398
00:29:34,795 --> 00:29:37,036
Baby. Go talk somewhere else.

399
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:38,801
Okay.

400
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:49,201
The President is dead.

401
00:29:50,515 --> 00:29:53,200
Four of six Joint Chiefs. V.P. missing.

402
00:29:53,795 --> 00:29:56,639
Reports of gun battles
in the streets of the capital.

403
00:29:56,715 --> 00:29:57,876
Your parties are panicking.

404
00:29:58,835 --> 00:30:00,360
The bigger cities are the worst off.

405
00:30:00,435 --> 00:30:03,405
The airlines
were the perfect delivery system.

406
00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:07,923
Carnival cruise vessel Dream
has been given permission to join.

407
00:30:08,195 --> 00:30:10,721
Twenty seven knots south and closing.

408
00:30:11,035 --> 00:30:13,083
How soon are they showing
symptoms after contact?

409
00:30:13,235 --> 00:30:14,999
The provisional
government currently considers

410
00:30:15,075 --> 00:30:16,520
northern Minnesota
to be a potential safe zone.

411
00:30:16,595 --> 00:30:20,042
Have you recorded any instance where
a person was bitten but not infected?

412
00:30:25,595 --> 00:30:27,438
How the hell do I know
if Russia's fallen?

413
00:30:32,075 --> 00:30:34,043
Sir, I cannot action that order.

414
00:30:34,115 --> 00:30:35,844
Colonel, I'm sorry,
but we cannot facilitate

415
00:30:35,915 --> 00:30:37,758
an evacuation for you or your men.

416
00:30:38,035 --> 00:30:41,039
Sir, there is nowhere to evacuate you to.

417
00:30:41,795 --> 00:30:43,877
Malnutrition. Dirty water.

418
00:30:44,515 --> 00:30:46,438
No gas for the winter or transportation.

419
00:30:46,915 --> 00:30:48,679
No bullets to fight.

420
00:30:48,755 --> 00:30:50,439
And it has spread
to all corners of the globe.

421
00:30:50,595 --> 00:30:51,960
The question
that we have got to address

422
00:30:52,115 --> 00:30:53,355
is what the hell is it?

423
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,676
About 5% of the population
aren't affected immediately.

424
00:30:55,755 --> 00:30:59,601
It is viral. it has to be viral.
There is no plausible alternative.

425
00:30:59,955 --> 00:31:03,880
And like any virus, once we find its
origin, we can develop a vaccine.

426
00:31:03,955 --> 00:31:06,606
- We find it, contain it...
- That's Dr. Fassbach.

427
00:31:07,235 --> 00:31:08,521
Virologist from Harvard.

428
00:31:08,595 --> 00:31:11,075
The analogy I keep coming back to

429
00:31:11,315 --> 00:31:12,646
is Spanish Flu.

430
00:31:12,795 --> 00:31:13,842
Spanish Flu?

431
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,003
It didn't exist in 1918, but by 1920,

432
00:31:16,075 --> 00:31:18,043
it killed 3% Of the world.

433
00:31:18,235 --> 00:31:21,523
He's our best bet
at figuring out what this thing is.

434
00:31:21,955 --> 00:31:23,480
You all read the same email I did,

435
00:31:23,795 --> 00:31:25,320
and it said "zombies."

436
00:31:26,595 --> 00:31:28,882
Are you completely out of your mind?

437
00:31:28,955 --> 00:31:31,526
So, the earliest mention
of the word "zombie"

438
00:31:31,595 --> 00:31:34,405
was in a memo
from Camp Humphreys in South Korea.

439
00:31:34,635 --> 00:31:36,239
We haven't had contact with them since.

440
00:31:36,315 --> 00:31:37,680
But this could lead us to the origin.

441
00:31:37,755 --> 00:31:39,519
If we knew where this thing started,

442
00:31:39,595 --> 00:31:42,678
then we'd have a chance
of developing a vaccine to stop it.

443
00:31:42,755 --> 00:31:45,599
So we send in Dr. Fassbach
there to look for the source.

444
00:31:45,675 --> 00:31:47,200
He's just a kid.

445
00:31:48,155 --> 00:31:49,236
You're right.

446
00:31:50,155 --> 00:31:51,680
Attention on deck!

447
00:31:56,195 --> 00:31:57,321
At ease!

448
00:32:00,315 --> 00:32:02,158
Mr. Under-Secretary.

449
00:32:04,315 --> 00:32:05,680
The Under-Secretary
here says you were

450
00:32:05,755 --> 00:32:08,440
his best investigator
when you were at the U.N.

451
00:32:08,515 --> 00:32:10,916
I want to send you in. With a team.

452
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:13,999
Help Dr. Fassbach
find whatever it is he needs.

453
00:32:14,755 --> 00:32:15,756
You brought...

454
00:32:15,835 --> 00:32:17,837
I wanted for the circumstances
to speak for themselves.

455
00:32:17,915 --> 00:32:19,041
No.

456
00:32:20,515 --> 00:32:22,677
Captain, I'm not your guy.

457
00:32:23,715 --> 00:32:26,844
You were on the ground
during the Liberian Civil War.

458
00:32:27,035 --> 00:32:30,596
Investigated Chechen war crimes.
Sri Lanka in '07.

459
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:33,685
Places you and I both know
Dr. Fassbach wouldn't last a night in.

460
00:32:33,755 --> 00:32:36,201
Gerry, a handful of SEALs
will go with you as security force.

461
00:32:36,275 --> 00:32:37,322
No.

462
00:32:37,395 --> 00:32:39,477
My guys will get you in,
you assist the doctor,

463
00:32:39,595 --> 00:32:41,643
pursue any leads,
my guys will get you out.

464
00:32:42,075 --> 00:32:43,565
We do the heavy lifting.

465
00:32:44,435 --> 00:32:47,723
I can't help you. I can't leave my family.

466
00:32:49,915 --> 00:32:51,883
Take a look around here, Mr. Lane.

467
00:32:52,395 --> 00:32:56,798
Each and every one of these people are
here because they serve a purpose.

468
00:32:58,235 --> 00:33:01,398
There's no room here
for non-essential personnel.

469
00:33:01,755 --> 00:33:03,120
There's a long line of people

470
00:33:03,235 --> 00:33:04,999
waiting for one of those bunks.

471
00:33:07,555 --> 00:33:09,444
You want to help your family,

472
00:33:09,555 --> 00:33:12,206
let's figure out how we stop this.

473
00:33:12,915 --> 00:33:14,917
It's your choice, Mr. Lane.

474
00:33:15,235 --> 00:33:16,396
Simple.

475
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,366
You don't work for them anymore.

476
00:33:20,435 --> 00:33:21,880
- Karin...
- You might not remember

477
00:33:21,955 --> 00:33:24,037
What this job did to you, but I do.

478
00:33:24,115 --> 00:33:26,083
So do not ask me to say yes to this.

479
00:33:26,155 --> 00:33:27,202
I have to go.

480
00:33:28,275 --> 00:33:30,039
They're going to kick us off the ship.

481
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:32,922
What?

482
00:33:33,515 --> 00:33:36,598
If I go, you, the girls, Tommy,
have a place to stay.

483
00:33:36,675 --> 00:33:39,519
If I don't, we're back in Philly tonight.

484
00:33:40,595 --> 00:33:43,041
What about Thierry?
Can't he do anything?

485
00:33:43,515 --> 00:33:46,598
Men like Thierry
aren't in charge of anything anymore.

486
00:33:47,355 --> 00:33:49,198
You keep this with you.

487
00:33:49,275 --> 00:33:50,276
I'll call in once a day.

488
00:33:50,355 --> 00:33:52,722
As long as I make that call,
everything's gonna be okay.

489
00:33:54,435 --> 00:33:56,085
I'm coming back.

490
00:33:56,435 --> 00:33:58,563
Okay?
We're going to make the best of it.

491
00:34:00,115 --> 00:34:01,446
As we do.

492
00:34:01,715 --> 00:34:03,126
Like we do.

493
00:34:13,795 --> 00:34:16,799
Okay, baby doll,
Daddy's got to go to work.

494
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,005
I'm not a baby.

495
00:34:19,955 --> 00:34:21,161
Okay.

496
00:34:21,475 --> 00:34:23,637
Tall, beautiful, tiny adult.

497
00:34:24,995 --> 00:34:27,077
I'll be back soon.

498
00:34:27,235 --> 00:34:28,361
Yeah?

499
00:34:29,795 --> 00:34:31,684
All right, tough guy..-

500
00:34:32,275 --> 00:34:33,356
Take care of the ladies for me?

501
00:34:33,435 --> 00:34:34,482
Yeah.

502
00:34:34,595 --> 00:34:35,756
Deal.

503
00:34:37,435 --> 00:34:39,005
You're awesome.

504
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,003
Daddy's coming back.

505
00:35:15,515 --> 00:35:17,040
This way, sir.

506
00:36:00,235 --> 00:36:01,316
Look.

507
00:36:01,395 --> 00:36:02,601
We don't know what we're walking into.

508
00:36:02,755 --> 00:36:04,723
So we do what they say. Okay.

509
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:07,355
If they move, we move.
If they stop, we stop.

510
00:36:07,435 --> 00:36:09,119
If things were to get crazy,

511
00:36:09,395 --> 00:36:10,726
just focus on their boots,

512
00:36:10,795 --> 00:36:12,320
focus on their voices,
and we'll be all right.

513
00:36:13,235 --> 00:36:14,839
These guys are hammers.

514
00:36:14,915 --> 00:36:16,679
And to hammers,
everything looks like nails.

515
00:36:16,755 --> 00:36:17,836
I heard that.

516
00:36:17,915 --> 00:36:19,440
You were meant to.

517
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:21,563
So, you see something that's important,

518
00:36:21,635 --> 00:36:23,842
you call it out and we'll make it happen.

519
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:25,521
Okay.

520
00:36:27,235 --> 00:36:29,397
You think we're gonna find anything?

521
00:36:30,075 --> 00:36:31,156
Yeah.

522
00:36:31,715 --> 00:36:33,399
Yeah, we're gonna find something.

523
00:36:34,755 --> 00:36:37,759
Mother Nature is a serial killer.

524
00:36:38,915 --> 00:36:40,405
No one's better.

525
00:36:40,755 --> 00:36:42,245
More creative.

526
00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:44,721
But like all serial killers,

527
00:36:44,795 --> 00:36:47,605
she can't help the urge
to want to get caught.

528
00:36:48,235 --> 00:36:49,839
What good are all those brilliant crimes

529
00:36:49,915 --> 00:36:51,997
if no one takes the credit?

530
00:36:52,115 --> 00:36:54,083
So she leaves crumbs.

531
00:36:55,115 --> 00:36:57,163
Now, the hard part,
why you spend a decade in school,

532
00:36:57,275 --> 00:37:00,199
is seeing the crumbs
for the clues they are.

533
00:37:00,835 --> 00:37:02,917
Sometimes the thing you thought

534
00:37:03,115 --> 00:37:06,483
was the most brutal aspect of the virus,

535
00:37:07,315 --> 00:37:09,636
turns out to be the chink in its armor.

536
00:37:11,995 --> 00:37:15,636
And she loves disguising
her weaknesses as strengths.

537
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:19,680
She's a bitch.

538
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:33,276
<i>Attention! D.C. has gone dark. I repeat,</i>

539
00:37:33,355 --> 00:37:34,720
D.C. has gone dark.

540
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,803
The Capitol evacuation
has been suspended.

541
00:37:37,195 --> 00:37:41,405
All available resources should be
directed to Naval Station Norfolk.

542
00:37:42,675 --> 00:37:44,803
All non-essential personnel

543
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:47,606
given F-6 status
and in groups A through E

544
00:37:47,675 --> 00:37:50,519
need to report
to the flight deck for relocation.

545
00:37:51,835 --> 00:37:54,964
Groups A and B relocating to Orlando

546
00:37:55,035 --> 00:37:57,436
should be on the stern
clear of the landing zone.

547
00:37:59,515 --> 00:38:03,645
I say again, all non-essential
personnel given F-6 status

548
00:38:03,755 --> 00:38:05,757
need to report to the flight deck.

549
00:38:05,915 --> 00:38:08,805
Choppers are inbound
for immediate relocation.

550
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:19,718
Mommy, is this dinner?

551
00:38:20,035 --> 00:38:21,161
Yes, sweetheart.

552
00:38:21,235 --> 00:38:23,203
Water here tastes funny.

553
00:38:23,715 --> 00:38:25,365
It's jet fuel, young lady.

554
00:38:25,715 --> 00:38:27,126
He's joking.

555
00:38:28,235 --> 00:38:32,081
I wish. Desal has trouble filtering it out.

556
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:36,277
Probably because
there's too many people on this ship.

557
00:38:46,555 --> 00:38:48,557
Everybody wake up.

558
00:38:49,275 --> 00:38:51,721
We're on approach
to Camp Humphreys.

559
00:38:51,795 --> 00:38:55,163
Most of the base is dark,
and no one is manning the tower.

560
00:38:55,235 --> 00:38:57,237
We're running on fumes,
so there's really no choice,

561
00:38:57,315 --> 00:38:58,726
I've got to put us down.

562
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:00,126
So buckle up.

563
00:39:26,635 --> 00:39:27,796
Hold up.

564
00:39:28,475 --> 00:39:30,557
Keep your finger off the trigger.

565
00:39:37,435 --> 00:39:38,641
Okay.

566
00:40:04,995 --> 00:40:06,440
Fassbach!Wait!

567
00:40:08,995 --> 00:40:10,281
Damn it.

568
00:40:18,155 --> 00:40:19,156
Move back!

569
00:40:20,315 --> 00:40:23,125
Friendly! Friendly!
Keep it down. Keep it down.

570
00:40:23,195 --> 00:40:25,004
What is this? What happened to him?

571
00:40:25,355 --> 00:40:26,561
He slipped. He's dead.

572
00:40:26,635 --> 00:40:28,603
Come on! Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

573
00:40:46,515 --> 00:40:47,676
Okay, I'm good!

574
00:40:47,995 --> 00:40:50,043
- Who was it? Who fell?
- Skilken.

575
00:40:50,195 --> 00:40:52,197
- Hold! Clear.
- Hold.

576
00:40:53,995 --> 00:40:55,679
I want an ammo count,
then you reload your mags!

577
00:40:55,755 --> 00:40:56,802
Yes, sir!

578
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:58,798
My boy who just died out there was 23.

579
00:40:59,595 --> 00:41:00,926
He was 23.

580
00:41:01,515 --> 00:41:03,244
You want to tell me why?

581
00:41:03,315 --> 00:41:07,081
Because the guy who just shot
himself, he's a doctor, a virologist.

582
00:41:07,755 --> 00:41:08,881
What are you talking about?

583
00:41:08,955 --> 00:41:10,764
He was supposed to be our best hope.

584
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,485
Well, he's not our best hope anymore.

585
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:14,683
Hey.
That guy volunteered to come here.

586
00:41:14,755 --> 00:41:16,200
He didn't have to, you know.

587
00:41:16,275 --> 00:41:17,515
None of them did.

588
00:41:17,715 --> 00:41:19,843
We're still trying to figure out
what the hell this thing is.

589
00:41:20,275 --> 00:41:22,676
Well, shit happens.

590
00:41:24,235 --> 00:41:26,397
The doctor would have
strongly agreed with you.

591
00:41:26,475 --> 00:41:27,965
How do we go about refueling?

592
00:41:28,035 --> 00:41:31,198
When I say so. And very carefully.

593
00:41:32,155 --> 00:41:34,476
The noise, are they drawn to it?

594
00:41:34,835 --> 00:41:37,281
Yeah. Sound draws them.

595
00:41:37,635 --> 00:41:40,036
Body shots only seem
to slow them down.

596
00:41:40,115 --> 00:41:42,595
Head shots do the trick,
but just to be safe

597
00:41:42,675 --> 00:41:44,757
we tend to burn them when we can.

598
00:41:45,075 --> 00:41:47,043
- You fought any Zeke yet?
- Yeah.

599
00:41:47,235 --> 00:41:49,602
- Where?
- Philly. Newark.

600
00:41:49,955 --> 00:41:51,002
Bad?

601
00:41:54,035 --> 00:41:55,275
- What about Houston?
- St. Louis?

602
00:41:55,435 --> 00:41:56,482
- Baltimore?
- Atlanta?

603
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:57,716
Detroit?

604
00:41:57,875 --> 00:41:59,001
Guys, I'll be honest with you,

605
00:41:59,115 --> 00:42:02,119
I don't know of any place back
home that's doing very well.

606
00:42:02,195 --> 00:42:03,606
All right...

607
00:42:05,275 --> 00:42:08,199
If the other guy was a virologist,
what do you do?

608
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:11,757
There was a memo
sent from this installation 11 days ago.

609
00:42:12,075 --> 00:42:13,315
It had the word "zombie" in it.

610
00:42:13,395 --> 00:42:15,363
Do you know anything about it?

611
00:42:15,435 --> 00:42:16,516
Yeah.

612
00:42:16,915 --> 00:42:19,316
It was an email, not a memo.

613
00:42:19,835 --> 00:42:22,281
Pretty obvious
nobody back home bothered to read it.

614
00:42:27,235 --> 00:42:30,444
Now, there's 15, 16 guys in this room.

615
00:42:30,755 --> 00:42:33,759
Most of them guards.
But all of them were bitten

616
00:42:33,835 --> 00:42:36,042
trying to get this man
handcuffed to the cot.

617
00:42:36,435 --> 00:42:39,484
Now, our colonel
said he was the first one.

618
00:42:39,875 --> 00:42:41,559
This colonel, is he around?

619
00:42:41,635 --> 00:42:42,841
Oh, yeah. He's right here.

620
00:42:50,315 --> 00:42:53,080
The guy who's shackled, do you know

621
00:42:53,315 --> 00:42:54,999
who bit him, what bit him?

622
00:42:55,315 --> 00:42:57,124
He was the base doctor.

623
00:42:59,115 --> 00:43:01,117
He'd just returned from the field.

624
00:43:01,435 --> 00:43:04,359
He'd been sent out
to verify the death of a soldier

625
00:43:04,435 --> 00:43:06,722
who had just gone AWOL
the week before.

626
00:43:07,115 --> 00:43:09,163
Some villagers had found this guy

627
00:43:09,235 --> 00:43:11,886
foaming at the mouth,
oozing some kind of black tar.

628
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,797
Then he tried to bite one of them.

629
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:17,162
They shot him, tied him up,
threw him in a barn.

630
00:43:31,315 --> 00:43:32,965
That's all we know, except the doctor

631
00:43:33,035 --> 00:43:36,118
comes back here
and begins attacking his patients.

632
00:43:36,195 --> 00:43:38,801
This soldier,
do you know where he came from?

633
00:43:39,035 --> 00:43:40,036
No.

634
00:43:40,115 --> 00:43:43,119
Anyone he might
have come in contact with?

635
00:43:43,195 --> 00:43:44,196
No.

636
00:43:44,275 --> 00:43:45,800
There's got to be records.

637
00:43:47,675 --> 00:43:49,564
You are welcome
to take a look if you want.

638
00:43:52,955 --> 00:43:55,561
Then the origin could
have come from anywhere.

639
00:43:55,875 --> 00:43:56,956
It's a shame you had to fly

640
00:43:57,035 --> 00:43:59,037
all the way out here to figure that out.

641
00:44:03,035 --> 00:44:04,719
How did you all escape this?

642
00:44:04,955 --> 00:44:07,322
The expenditure of ammunition.

643
00:44:08,795 --> 00:44:10,638
Is that how you tweaked your leg?

644
00:44:12,475 --> 00:44:14,364
No, shit's been bugging me a while.

645
00:44:15,395 --> 00:44:18,205
This prick stands right in the mix,

646
00:44:18,275 --> 00:44:19,640
while seven or eight of them

647
00:44:19,755 --> 00:44:21,564
turn Zeke all at the same time.

648
00:44:21,635 --> 00:44:23,717
But they got no time
for OI' Dirty Bastard here.

649
00:44:23,795 --> 00:44:26,162
Biting everything like fat kids love Twix.

650
00:44:27,755 --> 00:44:29,325
Got no time for his lucky ass.

651
00:44:29,395 --> 00:44:31,079
Ain't it obvious I'm charmed?

652
00:44:31,395 --> 00:44:34,444
The ones I saw bitten
turned in 12 seconds. Same here?

653
00:44:34,595 --> 00:44:35,926
Five or 10 minutes.

654
00:44:36,075 --> 00:44:39,363
Yeah, Davidson went
and he turned in 10 minutes.

655
00:44:39,675 --> 00:44:40,836
"Stevie?

656
00:44:40,915 --> 00:44:44,283
"Captain Spekes! Oh, my God!
My God! My God! Are they eating me?"

657
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:45,916
Who's that?

658
00:44:46,035 --> 00:44:47,719
Waste no time on that freak.

659
00:44:48,115 --> 00:44:49,196
He's C.l.A.

660
00:44:49,275 --> 00:44:51,198
Got caught selling guns to North Korea.

661
00:44:51,275 --> 00:44:52,606
Davidson,

662
00:44:53,115 --> 00:44:55,277
he turned in 10 minutes.

663
00:44:55,595 --> 00:44:58,963
That doesn't sound viral
to me at all, sports fans!

664
00:45:01,915 --> 00:45:03,724
You're with the C.I.A.?

665
00:45:07,355 --> 00:45:08,720
But they're not with me.

666
00:45:12,955 --> 00:45:14,525
And who are you?

667
00:45:14,595 --> 00:45:16,006
U.N.

668
00:45:16,075 --> 00:45:17,759
Oh, my God!

669
00:45:20,395 --> 00:45:22,443
Captain, put on the World Music!

670
00:45:22,755 --> 00:45:24,439
The day

671
00:45:25,235 --> 00:45:26,885
is saved!

672
00:45:27,635 --> 00:45:28,796
Why'd you sell guns to the North?

673
00:45:28,875 --> 00:45:29,956
Why not?

674
00:45:30,155 --> 00:45:31,395
Are they surviving this?

675
00:45:31,475 --> 00:45:32,681
Indeed they are.

676
00:45:32,755 --> 00:45:34,245
Using your guns.

677
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:37,319
Guns are half-measures.

678
00:45:37,595 --> 00:45:38,642
How then?

679
00:45:42,075 --> 00:45:43,201
All right.

680
00:46:08,755 --> 00:46:10,280
They took away

681
00:46:11,555 --> 00:46:15,276
the Zekes' exponential power.

682
00:46:16,955 --> 00:46:20,437
They pulled the teeth of all 23 million

683
00:46:20,875 --> 00:46:24,118
in less than 24 hours.

684
00:46:28,515 --> 00:46:31,598
The greatest feat
of social engineering in history.

685
00:46:32,035 --> 00:46:33,560
It's brilliant.

686
00:46:33,915 --> 00:46:35,201
No teeth,

687
00:46:36,235 --> 00:46:37,566
no bite.

688
00:46:38,155 --> 00:46:39,759
No great spread.

689
00:46:43,795 --> 00:46:44,876
Bullshit.

690
00:46:45,075 --> 00:46:48,522
More books,
fewer receptions, Boutros Boutros.

691
00:46:48,915 --> 00:46:50,883
Now, why do you have to burn them

692
00:46:50,955 --> 00:46:52,719
to ashes to get them to finally stop?

693
00:46:52,795 --> 00:46:54,399
Why do they move like a plague?

694
00:46:54,475 --> 00:46:56,204
Why is Israel winning?

695
00:46:57,275 --> 00:46:58,845
How is Israel winning?

696
00:46:59,635 --> 00:47:01,922
They sealed off their entire country

697
00:47:02,595 --> 00:47:05,565
days before the undead attacked man.

698
00:47:06,035 --> 00:47:07,366
First to know,

699
00:47:07,915 --> 00:47:09,360
first to act.

700
00:47:09,675 --> 00:47:11,803
People have been
building walls there for two millennia.

701
00:47:12,995 --> 00:47:14,599
Right. Yeah, but,

702
00:47:14,675 --> 00:47:16,359
finish all those

703
00:47:16,435 --> 00:47:19,086
thousands of years of work a week ago?

704
00:47:19,995 --> 00:47:21,485
Impeccable timing is all.

705
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:26,759
You want answers?

706
00:47:28,715 --> 00:47:30,444
Jurgen Warmbrunn.

707
00:47:31,475 --> 00:47:35,480
That's the man
in Jerusalem you want to see.

708
00:47:36,795 --> 00:47:38,001
You ever seen anything like that?

709
00:47:38,115 --> 00:47:39,276
Hell, no.

710
00:47:39,355 --> 00:47:42,677
We're going to Jerusalem.
I'm your co-pilot.

711
00:47:49,315 --> 00:47:50,441
Oh, hang on.

712
00:47:50,675 --> 00:47:52,279
Hang on. Hang on a minute.

713
00:47:53,315 --> 00:47:54,601
Hello?

714
00:47:56,155 --> 00:47:57,361
Gerry?

715
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:00,198
- Honey?
- Geny, can you hear me?

716
00:48:00,275 --> 00:48:01,322
Kaﬂn?

717
00:48:02,075 --> 00:48:03,315
Hello?

718
00:48:06,475 --> 00:48:08,125
God damn it!

719
00:48:17,835 --> 00:48:19,519
Give me your hand.

720
00:48:22,515 --> 00:48:23,562
No way. No.

721
00:48:23,635 --> 00:48:24,921
My mother. Dallas.

722
00:48:24,995 --> 00:48:27,566
Probably pacing a hole
in the floor right now if she's still there.

723
00:48:27,635 --> 00:48:30,206
Better chance of you seeing
her before me, that's all.

724
00:48:30,275 --> 00:48:32,755
It's a big plane. We got a lot of room.

725
00:48:32,835 --> 00:48:35,839
Better the devil you know
than the one you don't.

726
00:48:36,275 --> 00:48:38,960
You'll be all right.
Just pedal your ass off.

727
00:48:39,155 --> 00:48:41,237
Make sure Maverick here keeps
the nose of that plane

728
00:48:41,315 --> 00:48:42,441
pointed towards the sun.

729
00:48:42,515 --> 00:48:45,758
Just remember, don't lock
the bowser's fuel line to the inlet.

730
00:48:45,835 --> 00:48:47,360
Tell me 10 more times.

731
00:48:47,435 --> 00:48:48,880
- You good?
- Right here.

732
00:48:48,955 --> 00:48:51,003
All right. Don't rush.

733
00:48:51,715 --> 00:48:54,400
We've got one chance
to fuel their plane, so let's do it right.

734
00:48:54,635 --> 00:48:56,637
If you ain't a crack shot,
don't aim for the head,

735
00:48:56,715 --> 00:48:57,762
just get Zeke on the ground.

736
00:48:57,835 --> 00:49:00,998
Remember, "Spine's divine,
those knees they work just fine!"

737
00:49:01,075 --> 00:49:02,839
Let's go, lights out!

738
00:49:23,235 --> 00:49:25,522
Alpha in position.

739
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:27,643
Bravo moving out.

740
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:30,116
Remember, these things
are drawn to sound.

741
00:49:30,195 --> 00:49:33,324
So I need you close to target
before I bring you the truck.

742
00:49:33,395 --> 00:49:36,080
Now there's only one way
we're getting you on that plane,

743
00:49:36,195 --> 00:49:38,243
and that's quietly.

744
00:50:07,835 --> 00:50:08,882
Shit!

745
00:50:08,955 --> 00:50:10,923
God damn it! Shut that thing off!

746
00:50:15,355 --> 00:50:16,766
Looks like we just woke the dead.

747
00:50:17,915 --> 00:50:18,996
Out of respect for others,

748
00:50:19,115 --> 00:50:20,799
please turn off all pagers
and cell phones.

749
00:50:23,915 --> 00:50:25,485
We got to move.

750
00:50:26,195 --> 00:50:28,118
We've got to get out of here, let's move!

751
00:50:34,635 --> 00:50:35,875
Go, go, go!

752
00:50:45,835 --> 00:50:47,075
I'm gonna clear a path through Zeke!

753
00:50:47,155 --> 00:50:48,645
You pedal like hell!

754
00:50:51,155 --> 00:50:53,635
Come on, boys,
I need head shots! Tap 'em out!

755
00:50:53,715 --> 00:50:55,479
I want to see some Zeke on the ground!

756
00:51:33,395 --> 00:51:36,046
You're kidding me.
I'm a God damn Zeke.

757
00:51:37,395 --> 00:51:39,841
I got you, Captain. Just say the word.

758
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:43,365
It's all right, boys. I got this one.

759
00:51:45,715 --> 00:51:47,365
- God damn it.
- We got enough!

760
00:51:47,915 --> 00:51:49,838
We need to detach the fuel line!

761
00:51:51,555 --> 00:51:53,557
Israel better pay off.

762
00:52:03,515 --> 00:52:05,324
All right, I have instrument,
but only on single prop.

763
00:52:05,395 --> 00:52:06,556
You'll have to talk me through it.

764
00:52:09,715 --> 00:52:10,955
Okay, we're clear.

765
00:52:11,035 --> 00:52:12,525
Okay. Give me all the lights.

766
00:52:15,195 --> 00:52:16,845
Switch on the anti-icing.

767
00:52:16,915 --> 00:52:17,916
- Where?
- The red knob.

768
00:52:18,035 --> 00:52:20,436
- Got it, got it.
- Set up our heading 020 for departure.

769
00:52:20,915 --> 00:52:23,236
- We got to move!
- Set flaps 15 degrees.

770
00:52:23,395 --> 00:52:24,726
Flaps 15.

771
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:27,242
All right, we are all set.
Let's get out of here!

772
00:52:29,755 --> 00:52:31,120
Make it steep.

773
00:52:51,235 --> 00:52:52,600
- Gerry?
- Hi, baby.

774
00:52:52,675 --> 00:52:53,756
Hi. Hi.

775
00:52:55,635 --> 00:52:57,478
I tried to call you.

776
00:52:58,315 --> 00:53:00,124
I know, I was...

777
00:53:00,675 --> 00:53:02,882
It was bad timing, I was running around.

778
00:53:03,435 --> 00:53:04,925
Are you okay?

779
00:53:09,395 --> 00:53:11,875
Yeah, every/thing's okay. I'm okay.

780
00:53:13,555 --> 00:53:15,080
That's the spirit.

781
00:53:15,595 --> 00:53:16,721
Yeah.

782
00:53:17,355 --> 00:53:18,641
Listen,

783
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:20,645
Korea didn't work out.

784
00:53:23,795 --> 00:53:26,321
Now it looks like
we're gonna have to go to Israel.

785
00:53:26,395 --> 00:53:28,523
Try to get some rest on the flight.

786
00:53:29,355 --> 00:53:30,959
How are the kids?

787
00:53:34,475 --> 00:53:35,806
I think...

788
00:53:37,475 --> 00:53:39,955
They're really... They're good.

789
00:53:41,115 --> 00:53:42,958
I got Connie right here.

790
00:53:53,995 --> 00:53:55,156
Baby?

791
00:54:12,155 --> 00:54:14,761
Attention, unidentified aircraft.

792
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:18,078
You are in a restricted airspace
and not clear for landing.

793
00:54:18,515 --> 00:54:20,677
Jerusalem tower, Reach 394.

794
00:54:20,915 --> 00:54:22,883
Pan, pan, pan.
Request immediate landing.

795
00:54:22,955 --> 00:54:25,435
Contact Mossad,
office of Jurgen Warmbrunn.

796
00:54:25,515 --> 00:54:27,244
Special Envoy, United Nations.

797
00:54:37,355 --> 00:54:41,076
Stay with the plane. Be ready to bug out.
I'll be back before dark.

798
00:55:36,715 --> 00:55:38,046
The problem with most people is that

799
00:55:38,115 --> 00:55:39,799
they don't believe
something can happen

800
00:55:40,075 --> 00:55:41,918
until it already has.

801
00:55:42,155 --> 00:55:44,078
It's not stupidity or weakness.

802
00:55:45,315 --> 00:55:46,999
It's just human nature.

803
00:55:49,995 --> 00:55:51,360
How did you know?

804
00:55:51,595 --> 00:55:53,120
Gerald Lane.

805
00:55:53,675 --> 00:55:56,155
Wrote a self-defeating Jeremiad

806
00:55:56,235 --> 00:55:59,398
about his employer,
the U.N. back in 2010.

807
00:56:00,275 --> 00:56:03,245
Caused a few ripples.
Sidelined your career.

808
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:07,045
Thought you'd have parlayed
those ripples into a self-righteous book.

809
00:56:07,115 --> 00:56:08,799
No nose for profit.

810
00:56:09,195 --> 00:56:11,038
How did Israel know?

811
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:14,964
We intercepted a communique
from an Indian general

812
00:56:15,355 --> 00:56:17,881
saying they were
fighting the Rakshasha.

813
00:56:17,955 --> 00:56:20,561
Translation, zombies.

814
00:56:20,955 --> 00:56:23,196
Technically undead.

815
00:56:25,955 --> 00:56:27,400
Jurgen Warmbrunn.

816
00:56:27,475 --> 00:56:29,876
High-ranking official in the Mossad.

817
00:56:30,235 --> 00:56:34,957
Described as sober, efficient,
not terribly imaginative.

818
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:38,604
And yet you build a wall
because you read a communique

819
00:56:38,675 --> 00:56:40,837
that mentions the word "zombie"?

820
00:56:42,035 --> 00:56:45,676
Well, when put like that,
I'd be skeptical as well.

821
00:56:46,515 --> 00:56:48,563
In the '30s, Jews refused to believe

822
00:56:48,635 --> 00:56:51,161
they could be sent
to concentration camps.

823
00:56:51,435 --> 00:56:55,679
In '72, we refused to fathom
we'd be massacred in the Olympics.

824
00:56:56,155 --> 00:57:00,285
In the month before October 1973,
we saw Arab troop movements,

825
00:57:00,355 --> 00:57:03,120
and we unanimously agreed
they didn't pose a threat.

826
00:57:03,915 --> 00:57:08,318
Well, a month later, the Arab attack
almost drove us into the sea.

827
00:57:08,955 --> 00:57:11,356
So we decided to make a change.

828
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:13,635
A change?

829
00:57:14,115 --> 00:57:15,480
The Tenth Man.

830
00:57:16,835 --> 00:57:18,803
If nine of us
look at the same information

831
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:21,446
and arrive at the exact same conclusion,

832
00:57:21,515 --> 00:57:24,200
it's the duty of the tenth man
to disagree.

833
00:57:24,635 --> 00:57:27,081
No matter how improbable it may seem,

834
00:57:27,155 --> 00:57:29,203
the tenth man has to start digging

835
00:57:29,275 --> 00:57:31,562
on the assumption
that the other nine are wrong.

836
00:57:33,715 --> 00:57:35,205
And you were that tenth man.

837
00:57:36,115 --> 00:57:37,162
Precisely.

838
00:57:43,555 --> 00:57:47,924
Since everyone assumed that this talk of
zombies was cover for something else,

839
00:57:47,995 --> 00:57:51,078
I began my investigation
on the assumption

840
00:57:51,155 --> 00:57:55,399
that when they said "zombies,"
they meant zombies.

841
00:57:56,555 --> 00:57:58,125
Was patient zero from India?

842
00:57:58,395 --> 00:57:59,681
That's the problem.

843
00:57:59,755 --> 00:58:01,325
There's so many
potential sources in play

844
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:03,204
that no one knows where it began.

845
00:58:04,155 --> 00:58:06,078
The organ trade in Germany.

846
00:58:06,555 --> 00:58:10,276
Strange examples of violent behavior
across the Asian peninsulas.

847
00:58:11,235 --> 00:58:14,921
Meanwhile, the zombie plague keeps
spreading, and we do what we can.

848
00:58:16,835 --> 00:58:19,076
These are
the Jerusalem Salvation Gates.

849
00:58:20,155 --> 00:58:21,680
Two of 10 portals

850
00:58:21,755 --> 00:58:24,565
through the security perimeter
into fortified Israel.

851
00:58:29,115 --> 00:58:30,924
You're letting people in.

852
00:58:31,355 --> 00:58:34,438
Every human being we save
is one less zombie to fight.

853
00:59:16,635 --> 00:59:17,966
It's okay.

854
00:59:44,835 --> 00:59:48,521
If I could get into India, where
would I start? Who would I speak with?

855
00:59:48,595 --> 00:59:50,518
India's a black hole.

856
00:59:50,595 --> 00:59:52,597
Forget about patient zero.

857
00:59:52,675 --> 00:59:55,201
I can't do that.
It's too late for me to build a wall.

858
00:59:59,795 --> 01:00:01,923
I'm running out of time. I need specifics.

859
01:00:01,995 --> 01:00:04,157
- I need answers...
- I don't have answers.

860
01:00:04,235 --> 01:00:06,363
All you can do is find a way to hide.

861
01:00:12,635 --> 01:00:14,205
Get troops down there.

862
01:00:27,235 --> 01:00:28,760
It's too loud! It's too loud!

863
01:00:33,195 --> 01:00:34,685
They're coming over the top!

864
01:00:45,835 --> 01:00:46,916
Shit!

865
01:00:48,155 --> 01:00:49,998
Command, we have a breach
at Salvation Gate.

866
01:00:50,075 --> 01:00:51,645
They're coming over the wall!

867
01:01:33,515 --> 01:01:36,280
Get him to Jaffa Gate.

868
01:01:54,635 --> 01:01:56,956
She'll get you out of here,
she'll get you to your plane!

869
01:02:21,955 --> 01:02:23,605
Stay low!

870
01:02:23,675 --> 01:02:25,245
Wrong way! Wrong way!

871
01:02:26,515 --> 01:02:29,678
Go to landing point B.

872
01:02:30,355 --> 01:02:32,881
Roger, we are inbound
to landing point B.

873
01:03:38,555 --> 01:03:40,717
Hawk 5, almost there.
E.T.A. one minute.

874
01:03:42,035 --> 01:03:44,641
Hawk 5. Hawk 5,
you're patched in. Over.

875
01:03:44,715 --> 01:03:46,797
This is Hawk 5. Listen carefully.

876
01:03:47,315 --> 01:03:50,603
The city is breached,
and they're heading towards the airport.

877
01:06:03,915 --> 01:06:05,155
One thousand one.

878
01:06:05,235 --> 01:06:06,566
One thousand two.

879
01:06:06,635 --> 01:06:08,922
One thousand three. One thousand four.

880
01:06:10,595 --> 01:06:12,006
One thousand five.

881
01:06:12,875 --> 01:06:14,161
One thousand six.

882
01:06:14,795 --> 01:06:16,240
One thousand seven.

883
01:06:17,595 --> 01:06:18,926
One thousand eight.

884
01:06:23,035 --> 01:06:24,161
We got to move.

885
01:06:35,235 --> 01:06:36,441
You'll be all right.

886
01:06:37,115 --> 01:06:39,402
You're not gonna turn.
You're not gonna turn!

887
01:06:41,955 --> 01:06:43,286
We got to move.

888
01:06:44,195 --> 01:06:45,242
We got to move!

889
01:07:10,755 --> 01:07:12,280
5 going down.

890
01:07:19,555 --> 01:07:20,716
Chopper 5 is down.

891
01:07:20,795 --> 01:07:22,365
I say again, chopper 5 is down.

892
01:07:22,435 --> 01:07:24,244
L.Z. is overrun.

893
01:07:24,955 --> 01:07:28,846
Tower, Reach 394.
Requesting immediate departure.

894
01:07:29,115 --> 01:07:31,197
Tower to 394. Proceed to runway four.

895
01:07:31,275 --> 01:07:32,561
Good luck out there.

896
01:07:49,715 --> 01:07:50,921
No!

897
01:07:54,275 --> 01:07:56,164
There! That one!

898
01:08:03,315 --> 01:08:04,760
Stop. Stop.

899
01:08:24,395 --> 01:08:25,556
Go! Go!

900
01:08:38,675 --> 01:08:40,040
Get them out of here!

901
01:08:44,915 --> 01:08:47,759
Stay calm, please. Stay calm.

902
01:08:57,835 --> 01:08:59,803
Come on. Go, go, go.

903
01:09:06,715 --> 01:09:07,796
What's your destination?

904
01:09:07,875 --> 01:09:09,923
I don't know. We were headed here,
but I don't know.

905
01:11:17,475 --> 01:11:19,204
I'm Gerry, by the way.

906
01:11:20,475 --> 01:11:21,556
Segen.

907
01:11:22,555 --> 01:11:23,681
Segen.

908
01:11:24,675 --> 01:11:25,915
First or last?

909
01:11:27,075 --> 01:11:28,406
Just Segen.

910
01:11:28,795 --> 01:11:29,796
So, what we're doing,

911
01:11:29,875 --> 01:11:31,639
we've got to change this bandage
and we're gonna clean it.

912
01:11:31,715 --> 01:11:32,841
Okay?

913
01:11:37,035 --> 01:11:38,958
You okay? Okay?

914
01:11:43,195 --> 01:11:44,356
Okay.

915
01:11:47,515 --> 01:11:49,324
Come on, gut up. Gut up.

916
01:11:50,795 --> 01:11:52,126
Here we go.

917
01:11:54,075 --> 01:11:55,236
We're almost there.

918
01:11:56,395 --> 01:11:58,397
Okay. Big breaths.

919
01:11:58,875 --> 01:12:01,481
Let's get this over fast. Big breaths.

920
01:12:02,395 --> 01:12:03,556
Here we go.

921
01:12:07,955 --> 01:12:10,083
Come on. Good.

922
01:12:11,155 --> 01:12:13,078
Last step. Last step.

923
01:12:13,755 --> 01:12:14,802
Big breath.

924
01:12:16,675 --> 01:12:19,406
Good job. There it is. Okay.

925
01:12:22,995 --> 01:12:25,726
Okay. Okay, I think you've earned this.

926
01:12:29,355 --> 01:12:30,845
Very good. Okay.

927
01:12:31,995 --> 01:12:33,360
You a doctor?

928
01:12:33,835 --> 01:12:34,916
No.

929
01:12:35,355 --> 01:12:36,959
I've had some training in the field.

930
01:12:38,035 --> 01:12:40,037
How did you know?

931
01:12:41,035 --> 01:12:43,276
Cutting it off...
How did you know it would work?

932
01:12:43,635 --> 01:12:45,000
I didn't.

933
01:12:48,915 --> 01:12:51,441
Now I'm just a liability.

934
01:12:54,195 --> 01:12:55,640
This prick

935
01:12:55,715 --> 01:12:58,082
stands right in the mix,

936
01:12:58,155 --> 01:12:59,361
while seven or eight of them

937
01:12:59,435 --> 01:13:01,642
turn Zeke all at the same time.

938
01:13:01,715 --> 01:13:03,604
Is that how you tweaked your leg?

939
01:13:04,675 --> 01:13:06,677
No, shit's been bugging me a while.

940
01:13:07,515 --> 01:13:09,677
Got no time for his lucky ass.

941
01:13:10,875 --> 01:13:13,526
Now, the hard part is seeing the crumbs

942
01:13:13,595 --> 01:13:15,245
for the clues they are.

943
01:13:17,435 --> 01:13:19,358
And sometimes the thing you thought

944
01:13:19,555 --> 01:13:22,843
was the most brutal aspect of the virus

945
01:13:24,115 --> 01:13:26,595
turns out to be the chink in its armor.

946
01:13:26,915 --> 01:13:28,201
I don't have answers.

947
01:13:30,995 --> 01:13:33,999
All you can do is find a way to hide.

948
01:13:51,435 --> 01:13:52,516
Gerry?

949
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:53,960
Are you okay? Where are you, baby?
What's happening?

950
01:13:54,035 --> 01:13:55,116
I love you. I'm sorry.

951
01:13:55,235 --> 01:13:56,396
But you've got to get Thierry now.

952
01:13:56,475 --> 01:13:57,522
I'll find him.

953
01:14:00,635 --> 01:14:02,603
- Thierry! Thierry.
- Excuse me. Karin.

954
01:14:02,675 --> 01:14:04,040
Gerry needs you. I love you.

955
01:14:05,355 --> 01:14:06,686
Gerry? Where are you?

956
01:14:07,115 --> 01:14:08,276
On the last flight out.

957
01:14:08,355 --> 01:14:10,403
Listen, my phone is dying
and I need some quick intel.

958
01:14:10,475 --> 01:14:12,557
You gotta locate the closest
medical research facility.

959
01:14:12,635 --> 01:14:15,445
A C.D.C., a W.H.O.,
something that makes vaccines.

960
01:14:15,515 --> 01:14:17,563
- And the closest airport to it.
- I don't understand.

961
01:14:18,155 --> 01:14:19,441
No time to explain.

962
01:14:19,515 --> 01:14:20,596
Just make it happen, man.

963
01:14:20,675 --> 01:14:21,836
Okay, Okay-

964
01:14:22,075 --> 01:14:24,885
But, Gerry,
I still don't know where you are.

965
01:14:31,035 --> 01:14:32,275
Well, go and find out what he needs.

966
01:14:34,115 --> 01:14:35,640
You're gonna want to take this.

967
01:14:37,435 --> 01:14:38,561
Take it.

968
01:14:50,515 --> 01:14:51,926
Your battery is dead.

969
01:14:53,435 --> 01:14:56,120
We made contact
with Cardiff Airport, Wales.

970
01:14:56,195 --> 01:14:58,357
Your people directed us.

971
01:14:58,435 --> 01:15:01,166
There is W.H.O.
research facility nearby,

972
01:15:01,235 --> 01:15:03,841
but they are not sure
it's still operational.

973
01:15:03,915 --> 01:15:05,121
This is location.

974
01:15:05,595 --> 01:15:06,926
Can we make it?

975
01:15:15,955 --> 01:15:18,083
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your Captain.

976
01:15:18,195 --> 01:15:20,596
I'm glad to report that
we are on our final approach

977
01:15:20,675 --> 01:15:22,325
to Cardiff Airport in Wales.

978
01:15:22,395 --> 01:15:25,126
All European airports
are under lockdown.

979
01:15:25,195 --> 01:15:29,280
But we have been given
priority status and cleared for landing.

980
01:15:29,355 --> 01:15:32,040
We will be allowed to disembark.

981
01:15:32,955 --> 01:15:35,322
We are very, very lucky.

982
01:16:00,235 --> 01:16:02,237
Hey. Who do you belong to?

983
01:17:06,315 --> 01:17:07,396
What's there?

984
01:17:07,475 --> 01:17:08,556
What is it?

985
01:17:12,595 --> 01:17:14,802
You... Bags.

986
01:17:16,155 --> 01:17:17,884
We need trolley and bags.

987
01:19:22,795 --> 01:19:25,116
Mayday, mayday, mayday!
Bravo 160 heavy.

988
01:19:25,195 --> 01:19:26,720
Emergency descent!

989
01:20:18,515 --> 01:20:19,721
Prepare for impact.

990
01:22:35,875 --> 01:22:37,206
Got to move.

991
01:23:44,275 --> 01:23:45,606
Come on, come on.

992
01:24:06,915 --> 01:24:08,246
Give me something good.

993
01:24:08,315 --> 01:24:10,716
Sir, Cardiff Airport
lost contact with the plane.

994
01:24:10,795 --> 01:24:13,082
Lane is M.I.A. I'm sorry, sir.

995
01:24:28,115 --> 01:24:30,595
Chopper inbound for
immediate relocation.

996
01:24:30,675 --> 01:24:31,915
I say again.

997
01:24:31,995 --> 01:24:34,566
All non-essential personnel
given F-6 status

998
01:24:34,635 --> 01:24:37,206
need to report for immediate relocation.

999
01:24:39,315 --> 01:24:40,555
Ma'am?

1000
01:24:40,955 --> 01:24:42,844
Thierry would like a word with you.

1001
01:24:49,315 --> 01:24:51,238
Captain, it's only been 48 hours.

1002
01:24:51,315 --> 01:24:54,842
He's a resourceful man. There's every
chance he could have survived.

1003
01:24:54,915 --> 01:24:57,998
Sir, I gave him my word
we would look after his family.

1004
01:24:58,555 --> 01:25:00,045
Yes, sir. I understand.

1005
01:25:04,275 --> 01:25:07,563
Okay. Let's go. We're good.

1006
01:25:54,195 --> 01:25:55,435
Daddy!

1007
01:26:06,675 --> 01:26:08,245
Daddy!

1008
01:26:08,675 --> 01:26:09,676
Daddy!

1009
01:27:15,995 --> 01:27:18,077
You're a tough bastard.

1010
01:27:18,155 --> 01:27:19,486
And a lucky one.

1011
01:27:20,155 --> 01:27:21,645
Who are you?

1012
01:27:23,515 --> 01:27:26,598
I came here with a... With a woman.

1013
01:27:26,715 --> 01:27:29,002
Is she still...

1014
01:27:29,795 --> 01:27:33,163
Who are you?
Why have you come here?

1015
01:27:37,915 --> 01:27:39,280
Why do you keep looking at him?

1016
01:27:40,675 --> 01:27:42,757
'Cause he's the one in charge.

1017
01:27:46,995 --> 01:27:48,440
You know what this place is?

1018
01:27:48,955 --> 01:27:50,764
Of course I do. That's why I'm here.

1019
01:27:50,835 --> 01:27:53,361
Then you understand
how this must look to us.

1020
01:27:54,915 --> 01:27:56,041
This

1021
01:27:56,595 --> 01:27:58,438
is important to you?

1022
01:27:59,475 --> 01:28:01,716
- How long have I been out?
- Three days.

1023
01:28:01,995 --> 01:28:03,201
Give me the phone.

1024
01:28:03,395 --> 01:28:04,726
Just give me the phone.

1025
01:28:04,995 --> 01:28:07,123
Give me the God damn phone!
Give me the phone!

1026
01:28:07,195 --> 01:28:09,038
As soon as you answer my question.

1027
01:28:10,875 --> 01:28:12,036
Call it.

1028
01:28:13,035 --> 01:28:15,356
Call the number,
they'll tell you who I am. Call it.

1029
01:28:26,555 --> 01:28:27,602
Gerry?

1030
01:28:28,035 --> 01:28:30,242
- Yeah, I'm here. I'm here.
- My God.

1031
01:28:30,835 --> 01:28:32,360
We thought you were dead.

1032
01:28:32,515 --> 01:28:33,846
Gerry, where are you?

1033
01:28:34,195 --> 01:28:36,243
Thierry, I'm with
a couple of nervous gentlemen.

1034
01:28:36,315 --> 01:28:37,885
They need some bona fides
before I can speak with you.

1035
01:28:37,995 --> 01:28:39,042
Of course.

1036
01:28:39,635 --> 01:28:41,285
This is Thieny Umutoni.

1037
01:28:42,035 --> 01:28:44,197
Deputy Secretary-General.
United Nations.

1038
01:28:44,555 --> 01:28:46,239
To whom am I speaking?

1039
01:28:46,555 --> 01:28:47,636
Where's Karin?

1040
01:28:48,835 --> 01:28:50,837
Thierry, why didn't Karin answer?

1041
01:28:56,075 --> 01:28:57,236
I'm sorry, Gerry.

1042
01:28:57,675 --> 01:28:59,006
I did what I could.

1043
01:29:01,475 --> 01:29:02,761
What does that mean?

1044
01:29:02,835 --> 01:29:04,564
You've got to calm down.
No, stop! Stop.

1045
01:29:04,635 --> 01:29:06,285
You're going to hurt yourself.

1046
01:29:25,115 --> 01:29:26,116
You're okay.

1047
01:29:28,555 --> 01:29:31,559
His family has been sent
to a refugee camp in Nova Scotia.

1048
01:29:32,515 --> 01:29:34,279
I'm sure they'll be safe.

1049
01:29:34,555 --> 01:29:38,480
Are you? Thierry told you
who I am and what I used to do, right?

1050
01:29:38,635 --> 01:29:39,636
Yeah.

1051
01:29:39,715 --> 01:29:41,956
Then trust me when
I tell you they're not safe.

1052
01:29:44,755 --> 01:29:46,086
I understand how you feel.

1053
01:29:46,435 --> 01:29:47,880
- Do you? Yes?
- Yes.

1054
01:29:48,315 --> 01:29:49,805
Do you have a family?

1055
01:29:50,875 --> 01:29:52,240
- No.
- No.

1056
01:29:52,595 --> 01:29:55,326
Then you couldn't possibly understand,
could you?

1057
01:29:56,075 --> 01:29:58,442
I lost my son and wife in Rome.

1058
01:30:00,435 --> 01:30:02,915
Rather, I lost my son to

1059
01:30:04,635 --> 01:30:07,479
something that had once been my wife.

1060
01:30:10,835 --> 01:30:13,156
We have all lost someone, Mr. Lane.

1061
01:30:14,275 --> 01:30:16,403
In your case, there is hope at least.

1062
01:30:16,475 --> 01:30:17,806
I'm sorry.

1063
01:30:19,675 --> 01:30:20,801
I'm sorry.

1064
01:30:20,875 --> 01:30:22,206
Now,

1065
01:30:23,275 --> 01:30:25,004
why did you come here?

1066
01:30:25,995 --> 01:30:28,077
What do you need from us?

1067
01:30:28,875 --> 01:30:30,479
Your worst disease.

1068
01:30:34,755 --> 01:30:36,086
He wants a what?

1069
01:30:36,195 --> 01:30:37,685
Deadly pathogen.

1070
01:30:38,195 --> 01:30:39,959
With a high mortality rate.

1071
01:30:40,675 --> 01:30:43,121
- But curable.
- Okay, well...

1072
01:30:43,195 --> 01:30:45,562
You'd want a bacteria
rather than a virus,

1073
01:30:45,635 --> 01:30:46,921
I would think. Typhus?

1074
01:30:47,675 --> 01:30:49,200
Meningitis. Scarlet Fever.

1075
01:30:49,275 --> 01:30:50,436
Rocky Mountain Fever.

1076
01:30:51,035 --> 01:30:53,356
Anyway, excuse me, what's this for?

1077
01:30:53,635 --> 01:30:57,481
Mr. Lane believes we can use
such a disease against the undead.

1078
01:30:58,955 --> 01:31:01,196
I would give you points
for originality, Mr. Lane,

1079
01:31:01,275 --> 01:31:03,198
if we hadn't already tried that, first thing.

1080
01:31:03,315 --> 01:31:09,038
One of the many things a virus or
bacteria needs to thrive is a live host.

1081
01:31:09,155 --> 01:31:10,600
A functioning circulatory system.

1082
01:31:10,715 --> 01:31:12,843
I'm afraid it boils down
to one simple fact...

1083
01:31:12,915 --> 01:31:14,599
You can't make a dead person sick.

1084
01:31:16,075 --> 01:31:17,600
It's not for them.

1085
01:31:18,355 --> 01:31:19,845
It's for us.

1086
01:31:21,555 --> 01:31:23,956
I believe these things have a weakness.

1087
01:31:24,675 --> 01:31:26,598
And that weakness is weakness.

1088
01:31:27,115 --> 01:31:28,446
Our weakness.

1089
01:31:28,835 --> 01:31:31,236
I have witnessed them
literally bypass people.

1090
01:31:31,395 --> 01:31:34,080
Walk right around them like
a river around a rock. Why?

1091
01:31:34,915 --> 01:31:37,202
I think, because those people were sick.

1092
01:31:37,755 --> 01:31:39,086
I think they were terminal.

1093
01:31:39,155 --> 01:31:40,566
And these things could sense it.

1094
01:31:40,915 --> 01:31:42,997
I think they're spreading a pathogen,

1095
01:31:43,075 --> 01:31:44,804
and they need a healthy host.

1096
01:31:45,035 --> 01:31:47,163
But even if you're right, I mean,
infecting the populace

1097
01:31:47,235 --> 01:31:49,442
with a lethal illness is not exactly a cure.

1098
01:31:49,915 --> 01:31:52,395
It's not a cure. It's camouflage.

1099
01:31:55,995 --> 01:31:57,360
It's camouflage.

1100
01:32:01,875 --> 01:32:03,764
There's a natural precedent.

1101
01:32:03,955 --> 01:32:07,482
Hungry predators
will avoid diseased bodies.

1102
01:32:07,915 --> 01:32:10,521
Equipped with the right pathogen,
our troops

1103
01:32:10,595 --> 01:32:12,882
would be essentially
invisible to the enemy.

1104
01:32:13,955 --> 01:32:16,959
You understand the only way
to prove this theory of yours is

1105
01:32:17,475 --> 01:32:18,886
for some idiot to infect themselves

1106
01:32:18,955 --> 01:32:20,923
with a lethal pathogen and then...

1107
01:32:22,075 --> 01:32:24,965
...meet with her, face to face.

1108
01:32:28,275 --> 01:32:29,401
Yes.

1109
01:32:30,075 --> 01:32:32,157
Do we have what we need to try it?

1110
01:32:32,235 --> 01:32:33,475
We have all he could want.

1111
01:32:34,195 --> 01:32:36,801
Typhus, I-II N1, SARS.

1112
01:32:37,435 --> 01:32:39,085
The problem is,

1113
01:32:39,155 --> 01:32:41,203
they're all stored in B-Wing.

1114
01:32:42,155 --> 01:32:43,884
What's the matter with B-Wing?

1115
01:32:45,395 --> 01:32:48,478
Dr. Spellman. Our chief vaccinologist.

1116
01:32:49,835 --> 01:32:52,600
Within hours of the outbreak,
he'd been sent blood samples

1117
01:32:52,675 --> 01:32:54,882
to try and isolate the pathogenic cause.

1118
01:32:58,755 --> 01:33:00,245
Unfortunately...

1119
01:33:04,795 --> 01:33:06,126
This is B-Wing now.

1120
01:33:13,075 --> 01:33:14,884
God damn it.

1121
01:33:19,115 --> 01:33:20,401
How many?

1122
01:33:21,275 --> 01:33:22,436
How many are there?

1123
01:33:22,515 --> 01:33:24,358
There were 80 people working there.

1124
01:33:29,035 --> 01:33:30,844
I've never seen them move like that.

1125
01:33:30,915 --> 01:33:32,201
They're dormant.

1126
01:33:32,675 --> 01:33:34,677
They're awaiting stimulus.

1127
01:33:35,795 --> 01:33:36,876
NOW, this

1128
01:33:37,915 --> 01:33:39,360
is vault 139.

1129
01:33:39,915 --> 01:33:41,724
That's where your samples would be.

1130
01:33:42,955 --> 01:33:45,322
This is the skybridge.

1131
01:33:46,555 --> 01:33:48,922
That connects B-Wing
to the main building here.

1132
01:33:49,875 --> 01:33:54,164
And this, is the only thing
standing between us and the skybridge.

1133
01:33:54,315 --> 01:33:55,396
So,

1134
01:33:57,195 --> 01:33:59,038
what do you propose, Mr. Lane?

1135
01:34:13,995 --> 01:34:15,645
You are not serious.

1136
01:34:15,715 --> 01:34:19,083
B-Wing's a maze.
They'll never make it back alone.

1137
01:34:19,595 --> 01:34:21,438
We don't even know
if his theory is correct.

1138
01:34:21,515 --> 01:34:24,439
Well, I know I'm not asking
one of you to take him there.

1139
01:34:26,915 --> 01:34:28,599
Each has its merits.

1140
01:34:33,355 --> 01:34:35,881
- Last resort.
- It's too loud.

1141
01:34:38,075 --> 01:34:39,236
Let's go.

1142
01:34:41,595 --> 01:34:42,960
Try not to kill one.

1143
01:34:44,755 --> 01:34:48,077
It only makes
the rest of them more aggressive.

1144
01:34:49,155 --> 01:34:50,316
Yeah.

1145
01:35:07,435 --> 01:35:08,880
You sure you want to do this?

1146
01:35:09,635 --> 01:35:11,763
Of course I'm not. Let's go.

1147
01:35:12,475 --> 01:35:13,636
Good luck.

1148
01:35:14,995 --> 01:35:16,645
See you all shortly.

1149
01:35:21,675 --> 01:35:22,961
Good luck.

1150
01:35:26,435 --> 01:35:30,326
If anything comes down this hall before
we do, you seal these doors for good.

1151
01:35:30,555 --> 01:35:32,523
- Understood?
- Okay.

1152
01:37:59,195 --> 01:38:00,560
There they are.

1153
01:38:40,475 --> 01:38:41,476
Go, go.

1154
01:38:57,195 --> 01:38:58,401
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

1155
01:38:58,835 --> 01:38:59,996
Come on!

1156
01:39:22,955 --> 01:39:24,878
They're fine. They're fine.

1157
01:39:59,155 --> 01:40:00,486
Shit.

1158
01:40:23,875 --> 01:40:26,082
The vault we need is in 139.

1159
01:41:02,755 --> 01:41:03,916
Go!

1160
01:41:08,435 --> 01:41:09,766
Oh, my God.

1161
01:41:16,115 --> 01:41:17,605
Left, left, left!

1162
01:41:19,315 --> 01:41:20,646
What are you doing?

1163
01:41:20,995 --> 01:41:22,485
She'll get you to the vault.

1164
01:42:39,595 --> 01:42:40,881
That's the vault.

1165
01:42:40,955 --> 01:42:42,286
- We can make it.
- No, we can't.

1166
01:42:44,555 --> 01:42:46,205
We can't make it. Let's go!

1167
01:43:11,795 --> 01:43:12,842
They're not gonna make it.

1168
01:43:12,915 --> 01:43:14,519
You heard what Javi said,
we cannot open it.

1169
01:43:14,595 --> 01:43:15,960
They're not alone, we can't open it!

1170
01:43:16,035 --> 01:43:17,400
They are coming back!

1171
01:43:19,435 --> 01:43:21,278
We can't leave them there.

1172
01:43:21,715 --> 01:43:22,841
Come on!

1173
01:43:25,595 --> 01:43:27,085
Open the door!

1174
01:43:29,555 --> 01:43:30,966
- Run!
- Run!

1175
01:43:31,115 --> 01:43:33,641
Run! Faster, come on!

1176
01:43:33,835 --> 01:43:34,916
Run!

1177
01:43:35,955 --> 01:43:37,605
In, in, in!

1178
01:43:43,955 --> 01:43:45,320
Come on!

1179
01:43:46,115 --> 01:43:47,958
Now where is Gerry?

1180
01:43:50,075 --> 01:43:52,442
Where is he, where is he, where is he?

1181
01:43:53,875 --> 01:43:56,082
Come on, come on, where are you?

1182
01:45:09,715 --> 01:45:11,479
5-6-9-6-4.

1183
01:45:12,835 --> 01:45:15,122
5-6-9-6-4.

1184
01:45:44,075 --> 01:45:45,600
What happened to Gerry?

1185
01:45:59,595 --> 01:46:02,075
Not that one. Not that one.

1186
01:46:31,435 --> 01:46:32,561
Oh, shit!

1187
01:46:32,635 --> 01:46:33,716
Shit!

1188
01:46:56,195 --> 01:46:57,356
Jesus.

1189
01:46:58,115 --> 01:46:59,799
He's going to inject himself.

1190
01:47:06,035 --> 01:47:08,037
We have no idea
which one's going to work.

1191
01:47:08,115 --> 01:47:10,482
We don't know if any of them will work.

1192
01:47:11,075 --> 01:47:13,521
If he uses anything
he took from that left case,

1193
01:47:14,355 --> 01:47:15,845
he's dead anyway.

1194
01:47:41,515 --> 01:47:43,040
What's he doing?

1195
01:48:34,035 --> 01:48:35,878
How long does he have to wait?

1196
01:48:36,355 --> 01:48:38,881
Before he's infected? Not long, but,

1197
01:48:38,955 --> 01:48:41,606
that's not the question
we're really asking, is it?

1198
01:50:32,595 --> 01:50:33,926
Look at them.

1199
01:50:55,075 --> 01:50:56,679
He just walked right past him!

1200
01:51:02,595 --> 01:51:03,926
He walked right past him!

1201
01:51:04,715 --> 01:51:06,080
Like it was nobody!

1202
01:52:16,635 --> 01:52:17,796
Okay.

1203
01:53:05,915 --> 01:53:07,565
This isn't the end.

1204
01:53:17,355 --> 01:53:18,641
Not even close.

1205
01:53:18,715 --> 01:53:20,922
Hi, there. This is...

1206
01:53:20,995 --> 01:53:22,599
This is Amy. Is anyone out there?

1207
01:53:22,675 --> 01:53:24,518
Hello. I'm trying
to get in contact with anyone.

1208
01:53:24,595 --> 01:53:26,677
We've had some luck
finding people with this transmission.

1209
01:53:26,755 --> 01:53:28,359
We've lost entire cities.

1210
01:53:28,435 --> 01:53:30,756
When there's
no more people left to infect,

1211
01:53:30,835 --> 01:53:32,997
they go dormant. Whole cities are lost.

1212
01:53:33,075 --> 01:53:34,565
The World Health Organization

1213
01:53:34,635 --> 01:53:36,524
reports today that help may soon...

1214
01:53:36,595 --> 01:53:38,597
...a hybridized meningitis strain

1215
01:53:38,675 --> 01:53:40,996
with components of smallpox and H 1N 1.

1216
01:53:41,075 --> 01:53:42,759
We still don't know how it started.

1217
01:53:42,995 --> 01:53:44,485
The World Health Organization
has created

1218
01:53:44,555 --> 01:53:47,445
a vaccine that works
as a kind of camouflage,

1219
01:53:47,515 --> 01:53:50,997
making people who receive it
invisible to the infected.

1220
01:53:51,315 --> 01:53:52,521
We bought ourselves some time.

1221
01:53:52,595 --> 01:53:55,041
Volunteer forces
are delivering the vaccine

1222
01:53:55,115 --> 01:53:57,117
to areas that have been cordoned off.

1223
01:53:57,195 --> 01:53:59,960
Distribution efforts
began in earnest on April 10th...

1224
01:54:00,035 --> 01:54:01,400
The importance
of getting the information

1225
01:54:01,515 --> 01:54:03,643
out to those still alive
within the quarantine...

1226
01:54:04,595 --> 01:54:06,279
But it's given us a chance.

1227
01:54:22,715 --> 01:54:24,558
If you can get to a colder area,

1228
01:54:24,635 --> 01:54:26,603
to higher ground,
they move slower on the ground.

1229
01:54:26,755 --> 01:54:29,645
The Battle of Moscow is still raging.

1230
01:54:29,955 --> 01:54:34,597
Initial tests on the so-called camouflage
have been largely successful.

1231
01:54:39,475 --> 01:54:41,796
Others have found a way to push back.

1232
01:54:42,635 --> 01:54:46,082
Move, move! All right, juice 'em up!

1233
01:54:54,755 --> 01:54:57,076
Approaching target.
Permission to engage.

1234
01:54:57,435 --> 01:54:58,766
Permission granted.

1235
01:54:58,835 --> 01:55:01,361
All clear. Light'em up. Light'em up.

1236
01:55:03,035 --> 01:55:04,321
It's permanent!

1237
01:55:04,395 --> 01:55:07,604
It's settled, it's settled! It's over with!

1238
01:55:07,675 --> 01:55:09,677
There's no forgiveness in hell!

1239
01:55:09,835 --> 01:55:13,396
Whatever goes to hell, stays in hell!

1240
01:55:13,755 --> 01:55:16,884
This is Station 7 in Nebraska,
broadcasting on the shortwave band.

1241
01:55:16,955 --> 01:55:19,606
If you can fight, fight.

1242
01:55:19,675 --> 01:55:20,836
Head north if you can.

1243
01:55:20,915 --> 01:55:23,885
Hello?
Is there anyone out there hearing this?

1244
01:55:23,955 --> 01:55:25,241
Help each other.

1245
01:55:25,315 --> 01:55:28,285
Mexico City has been
declared a complete loss.

1246
01:55:37,555 --> 01:55:39,364
Be prepared for anything.

1247
01:55:44,715 --> 01:55:46,717
Our war has just begun.
