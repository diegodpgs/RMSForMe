he leaves clues,

with him and the car thief, and...

1093
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,881
I think most people
would say that he was

Most people would be wrong.

If I wanted the car thief off the street,
he'd already be off the street.

It's a six-month-long sting.

1318
01:21:08,227 --> 01:21:09,297
How would a predator

track a reptile?

1320
01:21:10,896 --> 01:21:13,740
Oh, they don't.
Most reptiles are at the top

of their food chain.

1322

1323
01:21:17,002 --> 01:21:18,504
They gotta have vulnerabilities.

1324
01:21:18,671 --> 01:21:21,242
Why the sudden interest
in the cold-blooded?

1325

1328
01:21:31,417 --> 01:21:33,897
Mm.
So because of the cold blood,

1329
01:21:34,053 --> 01:21:35,999
would they react to changes
in temperatures?

1330

You'd have to catch one first.
