1
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,239
This business

2
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,575
is a living organism

3
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:37,287
Multiplying constantly
 surrounded by predators

4
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:41,750
There's no rule for
 idle time or second guessing,

5
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,212
New discovery are made hourly.

6
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,798
New ideas
 are ready to be devored and redefined.

7
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:51,009
This business is binary

8
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,011
you are a one or a zero,

9
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:56,557
alive or dead

10
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,059
AntiTrust

11
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:06,066
There is no second place.

12
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,405
It has been suggested
 by the median congress..

13
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:15,409
that you're violating antitrust laws and
 threatening competition

14
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:20,205
Mr. Winston, Can you reasonably deny that
 you have a monopoly in this area ?

15
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,582
Well, the only monopoly...

16
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:25,294
we have at N.U.R.V, 
 is monopoly on excellence.

17
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:26,795
It is still a free market.

18
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:30,674
But a free market encourages competition
 You prevent it

19
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:36,346
You don't need to remind you the essence
 of competition is always been quite simple,

20
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:43,604
Any kid working in a garage anywhere
 in the world with a good idea can put us out of business

21
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:49,902
Let's try a communication scheme 
 if you have a good driver..

22
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,155
Move, move

23
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:57,492
Teddy, I think I have found
 our bottle neck

24
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:05,000
You did it !
 Yee-Haw!!

25
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,005
God! That feels good

26
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,006
Gorgeous!

27
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,509
We're geeks

28
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:23,477
Three months from today,
 N.U.R.V will launch Synapes

29
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:26,980
transforming the way
 humans communicate,

30
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,481
With Synaps,

31
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,150
the entire world will be able
 to send or receive

32
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,153
any message be in audio, video
 or text on any medium

33
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:37,991
any medium, any medium, ...

34
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:43,789
SYNAPSE will fully unite
 the global village.

35
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,463
You set yourself real ticking clock here, Gary

36
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:55,717
All of your competitor are desperate to get
 to the market place with this technology before you.

37
00:02:55,717 --> 00:03:00,097
It has even been suggested that you won't hit
 this very ambitious launch date

38
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,057
We're going to hit that date,
 you can bet on it

39
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,225
How can you be sure?

40
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:07,479
We'll do whatever it takes
 to get there

41
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:23,579
Pace yourself, Brian

42
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:27,207
It can go here

43
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,917
Milo, what do you think of this?

44
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,587
I know I promise my mom
 we're gonna make this garage famous

45
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:34,381
but I really don't think
 we're gonna be here that long

46
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:38,719
'Cause I’ve got us 3 appointment
 with the venture capitalists

47
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,220
Oh, that is fantastic

48
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,100
I can stop taking calls from
 those corporate recruitment, losers

49
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,020
I'll do the talking, Brian

50
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,563
Guys, what are these?

51
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,774
Don't you know the worse you look,
 the smarter they think you are

52
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,776
They are going to think
 you're a genius, Brian

53
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,738
I just have Milo and Ted,
 and the wallets flew open,

54
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,740
They were dying to give me their money.

55
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,619
You guys are the greatest duo,
 since Hewlett and Packard

56
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:04,661
Lenon and McCartney

57
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,746
Ben and Jerry

58
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,081
Ha Ha Ha

59
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,875
I'm Lennon, okay Teddy

60
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,794
Does that make me Yoko?

61
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:17,341
Look Alice, you got to make him
 do the start up with Teddy and me

62
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:23,263
Larry, if he wants to go and take a few interviews
 check out his options as his friend

63
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,766
I think you should support him in that

64
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:30,270
What to know the best way
 to manipulate somebody

65
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,813
Yeah

66
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,232
Don't try

67
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:34,358
As graduating students

68
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:40,572
 of the Standford University, Science department,
 you have a magnificent foundation in theory

69
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:43,575
what you need is a creative innovative...

70
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:46,578
A monopolist 
 Exactly

71
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:49,581
the guy knows how to get peoples attention

72
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,876
Shut up, shut up, shut up

73
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,211
I'm trying to listen !

74
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,088
who will fill your questions?

75
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,548
Thanks for taking the time to check us out

76
00:04:57,548 --> 00:05:00,717
I look forward to seeing some of you up here
 at the NURV campus, in the near future

77
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:01,218
Questions, cool

78
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:05,222
I got a question for him, alright?

79
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:13,313
Why not make SYNAPSE open source?

80
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,731
Don't you have enough money?

81
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,066
Huh, nice

82
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,359
Here is an interesting question

83
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,987
What kind of beverage do you
 offer your programmer?

84
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,531
Oh come on

85
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,074
He is avoiding the issue, man !

86
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:27,369
He should run for president or something

87
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:32,040
I'm just going to throw these at you, you know,
 like they do at the zoo

88
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:36,003
Hello?

89
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,380
It's for you

90
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,717
Hello
 Milo, this is Gary Winston,

91
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:43,635
I've heard great things about your work,

92
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,929
I'm hoping you and your friend Teddy
 can come up here.

93
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,806
Hey, Larry, you still have got
 my Union Jack CD

94
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:48,807
No, I gave it back..

95
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,101
Ok, I don't know who this is but
 your timing really blows

96
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,228
'cause I just saw him in a live chat

97
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:56,231
Right, well, a pair of airline tickets are
 on there way to you,

98
00:05:56,231 --> 00:06:00,986
I would love to show you
 some of the things we are doing here

99
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,116
Who was it ?

100
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,535
Garry Winston

101
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,579
Ha, that would be funny

102
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:14,708
I just spoke to Garry Winston?

103
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,128
I can't believe you are not going to take that ticket

104
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:18,712
Give it to me!

105
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,339
You don't want to work there, Brian

106
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:23,634
They squeeze everybody out of business,
 they get bigger and fatter

107
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,344
That's why I want to work there

108
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:28,805
You sure he didn't ask for my number?

109
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,682
Milo, we can't go up there

110
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,726
They don't even know
 the meaning of open source

111
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,645
You know this,
 we have talked about this

112
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:36,313
They just want to own everything

113
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,482
They clone stuff, they reverse engineering it

114
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:43,111
I, I know. / Everybody is stuck
 with their inferior proprietary version

115
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,239
They are being investigated
 by the justice department for christs’ sake

116
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,241
Tell him, Harry

117
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:52,079
I think that he should go up there and
 check it out if he is curious

118
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,831
You do?

119
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:57,042
Sure, I mean it's your life

120
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:00,003
I need another beer

121
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:16,144
So, you couldn't convince
 your friend Teddy to come home

122
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:20,232
No, he is pretty tight with his folks

123
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,401
You know we can move them up here
 same goes for yours

124
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:24,570
My parents are dead

125
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,530
I'm sorry man

126
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,407
So how far is the campus?

127
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:31,076
We're not going to campus.

128
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,616
All I can say is it's unfortunate,

129
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:14,286
we offered a lot of money.
 A substantial amount of money, Gary, no sell

130
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:18,081
Can we buy into their stock? 
 Or is that a justice department problem too?

131
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:23,086
There is no stock, Randy
 I mean there's no company

132
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,297
Garry Winston's office
 May I help you?

133
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,594
Thanks for holding. Yes, he is in a conference
 right now. Can I take a message?

134
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:41,188
The cold, hard facts are
 that anything is possible.

135
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:44,858
Anything, anything you're just not
 thinking creatively.

136
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,402
I have every confidence that you can do that, Phil.

137
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:51,698
- This is difficult one but we're gonna prevail
 - Alright, alright

138
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,076
Garry Winston's office

139
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:57,287
Let me check that for you

140
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,497
I'm sorry, I don't see anything here

141
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:01,083
Milo

142
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:06,797
Hi.. not every day
 we have genius in the house

143
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:09,591
- Want a soda pop or something?
 - No, thanks

144
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,134
Come on in

145
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:20,227
Digital canvas

146
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:23,021
The house knows the paintings I like,
 knows my favorite music,

147
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,523
same for anybody else
 that's in the system

148
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:28,110
There's a little sensor
 that defects who's in the room

149
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,071
Doesn't Bill Gates have
 something like that?

150
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:36,618
Bill who? ha, ha. ah,
 no, no. his is primitive.

151
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:40,080
So I understand you are thinking of
 doing a start up

152
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,082
Yeah.

153
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:48,755
My friends and I have been planning on 
 doing a media delivery system for a long time

154
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:53,552
It would be open source, we offer it free
 to everybody, just charge for tech support.

155
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,053
Wow, free.

156
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:58,056
It's a cut-throat business we're in Milo

157
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:05,647
It's just a matter of time before someone borrows
 your technology, improves it and makes a billion dollars on it.

158
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:09,860
What would you do with a billion dollars Milo?

159
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,069
Mmm, I don't know

160
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,571
I'll tell you what you could do

161
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:17,868
You could take that money and put it back into
 technology, education, the arts

162
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:19,786
You can transform culture

163
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:23,499
I founded opera companies, symphony orchestras,
 museums, theatres, ..

164
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:27,461
I have donated thousands of computers
 to schools through out the country

165
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,713
The question
 really is,

166
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:35,010
How many of the people you share discoveries with
 will be outulistic?

167
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:40,265
and how many will make fortunes of
 your generosity?

168
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:44,645
Come on in here

169
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:54,029
Check this out.

170
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,365
huh

171
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:59,034
- This is the SYNAPSE satellite.
 - You bet.

172
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:03,038
I have 240 of these up there

173
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:06,250
12 different orbital patterns,
 20 satellites,

174
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,252
mother satellite of each ring

175
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:10,045
passes over us
 every night at 10 o'clock

176
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:14,049
to allow for station keeping,
 re-programming, etc.

177
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,885
They in turn pass the data along
 to the sister satellites in their realm

178
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,095
That's the coolest I ever seen.

179
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:19,555
I'm total wrapped up in this

180
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:22,766
It's like I’ve got my mission control 
 right here on my PC

181
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:26,270
Activation codes,
 IP address, flight pass..

182
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,565
- It's the best train set ever, hum?
 - You bet

183
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,072
We've loaded a back door
 to receive SYNAPSE transmissions

184
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:40,367
and all of our OS software
 for the past 6 years,

185
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:48,333
We've developed compression schemes and 
 file formats that achieve connectivity, but..

186
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,960
We have a problem

187
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,463
You know what that problem is?

188
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:58,594
Ah, your adaptors can't overcome
 the band width limitation of wireless hand helds

189
00:11:58,594 --> 00:11:59,970
That's right

190
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:04,016
Data takes too long to download
 so your image get's..

191
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:06,185
Image, ah, goes fuzzy

192
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:07,769
- Fussy, yeah,
 - Ha ha

193
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:15,277
Can you get this done in time
 to meet your date?

194
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,904
With you, I can

195
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:25,496
So I understand your friend Teddy is
 kind of attached to his parents.

196
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:27,331
It's very commendable

197
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:29,333
Ah, the truth is he's ah..

198
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,585
Milo, I know, he thinks

199
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,212
we're cloned
 too many programs

200
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:36,632
an forced people to buy our inferior versions
 and blah, blah, blah..

201
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:38,050
add infinite item and nauseousm

202
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,301
I've heard it all before.

203
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:40,385
I even understand it,

204
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,346
it's the nature of competitive business.

205
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:43,805
When you're on top

206
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,141
people attack the quality
 of your product.

207
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:48,185
It comes with the territory

208
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:52,689
So when the attacks get personal 
 that Gary Winston is satan web sites,

209
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:57,903
digitising my wife's face on porn star bodies

210
00:12:57,903 --> 00:13:00,239
I don't like that

211
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,617
You're one of maybe
 twenty programmers in the world

212
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:06,620
with the mastery it going to
 take to finish this thing

213
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,250
We'd love for you to join us

214
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:15,295
The future holds limitless possibilities, Milo

215
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,131
You decide what the future holds for you.

216
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,758
Let me know

217
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:25,722
You know I look at you and
 see something I haven't seen in 20 years

218
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,976
- What?
 - I see me!

219
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:45,742
- Alice
 - Umm,

220
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:59,089
So when is Brian coming from the T.V?

221
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:00,591
I don't know

222
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,847
I'm going to leave you two alone, o.k?

223
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,276
Why are you doing this?

224
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:20,444
Teddy, come on

225
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:22,613
He can't hit his date without you, can he?

226
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:27,242
Remember that lecture Ginnings gave?
 about open source

227
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:28,160
Yeah

228
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,871
He said human knowledge
 belongs to the world

229
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:33,040
Like Shakespeare or Asprin

230
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,709
Teddy, I know you are disappointed,

231
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,920
I just feel like this is the right thing
 to do for now,

232
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,797
They were interested in you too,
 Gary even mentioned you

233
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,091
Yeah, well.. I'm not interested in them

234
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:44,426
That's fine.

235
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,845
I get what's important to you

236
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:49,640
This is important to me.

237
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:53,852
And I know your are going to
 get your venture capital

238
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,229
We did, We had to settle for 850,

239
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:57,231
because we lost you

240
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,982
So, it will be enough.

241
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:01,860
It'll be enough because they got you

242
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:05,906
We're both going to do something great

243
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:07,741
Sure

244
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:10,285
I just thought we were
 going to do it together

245
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,682
Milo, this is Mr. Barton
 from the...

246
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:33,600
Department of Justice

247
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,477
- Sorry about the glass
 - No problem

248
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:38,605
How are you, Milo. I am here as a friend

249
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:42,359
I understand you signed up
 with Gary Winston

250
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:46,446
You know Milo, we're at
 a great disadvantage with NURV

251
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:50,367
I mean our experts are not
 as smart as theirs

252
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:56,665
The truth is we could do with a real smart guy
 on our team to help pick our fights

253
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,753
Ha, I’m going to take a real shot
 in the dark here, O.K?

254
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:05,048
I can offer you $42,000
 a year and a Buick

255
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,801
if you change your mind and join us.

256
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:12,931
I'm hoping you have a feeling
 that is the right thing to do

257
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,477
Well, I’m sure what you're doing
 is important, Mr. Barton

258
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:21,440
I just fell like this is a...
 kind of my time to make my mark

259
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,735
Well, like I said,
 it is a shot in the dark

260
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:28,030
No, no, no,
 please, please, keep it.

261
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:32,075
If you see something up there
 that rubs you the wrong way

262
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:35,078
do the right thing

263
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:12,658
What are they building?

264
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:15,536
Oh, That's a...
 Building number 21

265
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:18,205
it's way behind schedule.
 It's still off limits.

266
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:19,998
It's our digital broadcast base.

267
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:24,002
Taking forever to get the fiber optics
 linked in there

268
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,800
This is the day care center

269
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,553
Gary has put a lot of money in there.

270
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:37,391
And the people with kids are not hot shot geeks
 or anything. They just payroll clerk or whatever

271
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,852
That's cool
 I know, that's really cool

272
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:47,067
The card is encoded.

273
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,945
It tells who came through the door
 and when

274
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:53,782
If you see a tailgater
 that someone coming on your swipe, report him

275
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:58,495
If you see someone wandering around without ID,
 it is your duty to challenge him

276
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:01,707
I don't give a shit
 if you are a stock option billionaire

277
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:05,002
If you don't challenge,
 I'll have your butt

278
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:06,461
He seems a little tense

279
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:07,796
Oh, ??? , yeah, yeah

280
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:09,798
He gets his chain pulled a lot
 by the geeks around here

281
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:12,885
because he is non-tech
 Because he is a ex-cop or whatever

282
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:23,353
Whoa..a, Lisa actually looked at you

283
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:27,524
She has a heavy graphics background

284
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:31,111
She's programming scalable user interfaces
 for the SYNAPSE modules

285
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,572
She's a smart girl

286
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:35,532
Every geek has a thing for Lisa, but

287
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:37,159
she won't let anyone get near her

288
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,619
I have a girl friend

289
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:39,953
What ?

290
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:42,956
you got like, you got like a girl friend
 A 3 dimensional girl friend

291
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,709
That's really rare around here

292
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:50,589
So, welcome to the egg

293
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:53,759
Ah.., everybody listen up

294
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:55,177
Can I have your attention, please

295
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:58,805
This is Milo. Milo, This is everybody
 Hello, Milo

296
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:05,395
This is Lori, Dorren..
 You'll get to know everybody, I’m sure

297
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:09,650
And this is your world

298
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,402
Your are now officially an egg man
 Whew...

299
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:13,987
Wheeww

300
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:17,491
Ah, oh, O.K,

301
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:22,287
so we got a, electronic copy of
 Gary's book with complementary player, as well as

302
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:26,124
an audio version narrated
 by Gary of course.

303
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:28,168
A.. hand held digy, cell phone, and

304
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,420
the keys to your brand new car

305
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,797
Guess that's it man

306
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:35,175
A, your counselor will be by to fill you
 in on the rest of the details

307
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,260
You're going to love it here

308
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,179
- Thank you and thanks for...
 - My pleasure,

309
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,597
Good luck

310
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,898
Hey, Milo,

311
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:51,275
Just a little advice,

312
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:53,610
don't get to close to Stinky

313
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,237
You're hysterical Dessy

314
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:57,823
What do they do for a village idiot
 when you're here?

315
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:02,744
Dude, What do they do with all the air fresheners
 when you're here / I don't know

316
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,394
Busy?

317
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:28,979
No,

318
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:34,318
umm, I just actually waiting for my counselor
 to come by and introduce himself

319
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:37,863
Oh, hello Milo, I’m Gary

320
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,240
Okay

321
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,701
Come on let me introduce you
 to the rest of the team

322
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:44,828
Hey, Stinky
 Oh, Hi, Gary,

323
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:46,705
how's it going?

324
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:48,081
Hi Gary, how's it going

325
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,792
Dessy and Stinky are
 working on compression

326
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:54,421
Josh and Vancat are
 writing protocol handlers

327
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:55,589
This is Milo

328
00:20:55,589 --> 00:21:00,469
- Milo is working on the all important adaptor
 - Alright, Milo

329
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:06,099
When I announce the launch date
 for SYNAPSE

330
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,977
it wasn't arbitrary,

331
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:12,814
but it wasn't based on
 our progress either, as you know

332
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:20,030
If we do not have a workable version of
 SYNAPSE by then, it's over folks

333
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:24,535
And this is the glib of little headline
 you will be seeing through out the world

334
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:25,994
-

335
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:28,205
- Not gonna happen, is it?
 - No

336
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:29,706
- Is it?
 - No

337
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:34,461
Not going.. to happen

338
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:37,965
There are no constraints, no boundaries

339
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:39,800
Surprise me,

340
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,760
challenge me,

341
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,596
Defy me,

342
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:46,723
Defy yourselves

343
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:49,017
You have a choice.

344
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:52,855
You can be forgotten,
 or you can be remembered

345
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:56,859
as one of the noble few
 who made it

346
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:02,489
Now's the time,
 to go way beyond your potential

347
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:05,576
Now's the time,
 to dig down deep folks.

348
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:09,580
Now's the time,
 to show why you are the elite

349
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,456
The chosen few.

350
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,209
The rare lights that give
 this company

351
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:15,627
its uniqueness

352
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:18,964
its lumineses.

353
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:24,303
Now's the time to shine

354
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:42,070
Corporate condo's are almost
 as romantic as they sound associate

355
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:45,282
She brought me here.

356
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:48,577
Well, I think it's...

357
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:51,622
I...

358
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:53,415
What do you think?

359
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:56,627
Did I tell you he has never been
 anyone's counselor before?

360
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:05,260
I did.

361
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,221
I'm sorry the house is great 


362
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:11,934
It's great and so are you 
 Yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah

363
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:13,727
- Really?
 - Really.

364
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:17,439
- Come on, I love you
 - You do?

365
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:24,154
Show me the bedroom

366
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:28,158
most of us who write software achieve
 our greatest work before 8:30

367
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:31,161
As I grow older I know how important..

368
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:34,122
Are you going to keep working?

369
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,429
Oh, hi, Gary

370
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:54,059
In the middle of something?

371
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,311
- No.
 - Check this out.

372
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:06,697
Huh,
 huh!

373
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:10,117
Wow!

374
00:24:10,117 --> 00:24:12,786
Who did this? 
 A Josh or a vangetta or what..

375
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:15,831
Somebody, yeah.
 Think you can use it?

376
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:20,085
- Yeah,
 - the compression is awesome

377
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:22,045
Struction is perfect

378
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:23,964
Ha,ha,ha

379
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:25,549
Oh, god,
 oh

380
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:28,427
So much fun,
 love doing this

381
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:33,348
the governor of Missouri has called
 upon the president to declare a state of emergency.

382
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:39,605
In local news,
 a tragic car accident took the life of Portland area
 computer software entrepreneur, William Sud..

383
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:44,818
computer scientist of Messachusets Institute of technology 
 and a genius in his field

384
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:49,031
Sud was found to have both
 protract and alcohol in his car

385
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:52,910
- Milo
 - Hi

386
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,540
You're pretty famous around here / Yeah,

387
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:01,335
but getting a bit of a teachers pet rep.

388
00:25:01,335 --> 00:25:02,961
I wouldn't worry about it

389
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:06,548
I mean you have to figure that most people
 around here were their teachers pets

390
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:08,550
- Were you?
 - We moved around a lot

391
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,470
- Barely knew my teachers
 - Me too, I..

392
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:14,848
- What were you?.. An army brat or something?
 - Yes, something like that

393
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:18,352
What do you got there?

394
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:21,730
I wanted to show you
 the interface systems... for SYNAPSE

395
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,398
OK, here

396
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:27,110
I'm Lisa by the way
 Yeah, I know

397
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:29,947
Hi, you have reached the office of Skullbox

398
00:25:29,947 --> 00:25:31,281
Teddy and Larry are out right now,

399
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:34,952
Leave a message and we will call you back
 when you are out and leave you one

400
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:37,663
Hey Teddy, it's Milo

401
00:25:37,663 --> 00:25:41,625
Uh, just calling
 because it has been a while and

402
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:44,253
uh, guess I’m kinda hoping
 you're not still pissed at me

403
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:45,295
- Hi

404
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:50,175
- Hey, how's it going?
 - OK, I guess

405
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:54,721
- And Larry?
 - Good, yeah

406
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:58,684
- So, you guys making progress?
 - Sorry, that's classified information,

407
00:25:58,684 --> 00:26:00,561
we had to sign all those non-disclourser forms.
 You know how it is

408
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:03,355
Oh yeah, yeah,
 me too, me too, yeah

409
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:05,899
Still, work is not the only thing
 to talk about is it?

410
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:07,734
Oh, of course not

411
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:11,780
So, what's you been up too?

412
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,157
Working

413
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:19,413
It's good to hear from you

414
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:22,291
Even though you are the enemy now

415
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:27,087
Gary Winston's office, can you hold please, thank you

416
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:29,423
Thank you so much for holding,

417
00:26:29,423 --> 00:26:32,551
How may I help you?
 Let me just check that for you

418
00:26:33,594 --> 00:26:38,223
The Department of Justice says that if we acquire
 net mail they will view it as anti-competitive

419
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:42,311
Well, why didn't you tell me this
 before we decided to forego R and D..

420
00:26:42,311 --> 00:26:45,230
Well, at the time, they indicated
 that it wouldn't be a problem

421
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,982
But they have a bureaucratic 
 mind set, Gary they..

422
00:26:47,024 --> 00:26:48,400
They do?

423
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,736
I count on you
 to solve problems, whatever it takes

424
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:52,321
show me some creativity

425
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:53,655
Gary, we're talking about the law

426
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:55,199
It's not like making software,

427
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:56,325
There are limits

428
00:26:56,325 --> 00:26:58,785
--;

429
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:00,078
No limits!

430
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,456
Stop thinking like a lawyer for a second

431
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:06,627
and show me some kind of creativity

432
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:08,587
Yes, Sir.

433
00:27:16,887 --> 00:27:18,222
He'll have to get back to you

434
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:20,432
Gary Winston's office

435
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:22,684
You can go on in, Milo

436
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:27,147
Gary Winston's office.
 Yes, he is in a conference right now,

437
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:28,023
May I take a message?

438
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:29,441
Gary

439
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:34,071
- You wanted to see me?
 - Yeah,

440
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:43,455
Take a look

441
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:51,421
This is amazing.
 Who's doing all this?

442
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:53,340
What does that mean?

443
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:56,802
- What does that mean, huh?
 - Nothing, I, I...

444
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:06,186
I'm sorry

445
00:28:06,186 --> 00:28:08,230
that wasn't meant for you

446
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:12,860
Justice Department is driving me nuts

447
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,904
They make everything strategic I do,
 look sorted

448
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:20,325
Every good chess player knows his
 opponents moves before he makes them

449
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:22,202
Everyone in business tries to get ahead

450
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:24,621
I get there first,
 I’m a bad guy

451
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:26,415
What are we doing here?

452
00:28:26,415 --> 00:28:28,208
Are we making chemical weapons?

453
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:29,710
Kiddy porn?

454
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,171
Are we strip mining?
 No!

455
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:36,341
Why are they after me?

456
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:42,514
The software business
 is binary

457
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:47,144
you're a one or a zero,
 alive or dead

458
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:56,445
- It scares, don't you think? 
 - Definitely, yeah

459
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:04,495
It’s your copy

460
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:18,800
I don't want to speak too soon,

461
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,803
but I think I cracked it, Larry

462
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:28,727
I really think I cracked it

463
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:30,896
Huh

464
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,871
Are you going to tell me
 what's bothering you are not?

465
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:49,456
- Ok
 - Ok.

466
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:53,335
Gary gave me a
 new compression scheme today

467
00:29:53,335 --> 00:29:55,671
I said " Who's doing all this ",

468
00:29:55,671 --> 00:29:57,673
cause I was impressed
 I wanted to know where

469
00:29:57,673 --> 00:29:59,466
it was coming from
 Right ?

470
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:03,470
He just lost it, like...
 he was, he shouted at me,

471
00:30:03,554 --> 00:30:07,683
he had this look in his eyes, like..

472
00:30:07,683 --> 00:30:10,227
How horrible!
 Yeah

473
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:13,564
- But where did it come from? 
- I don't know

474
00:30:13,564 --> 00:30:15,983
That's what I’ve been asking myself

475
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:19,903
I asked around. Nobody knows
 anything about it, uh.

476
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:23,407
You know, so does he have
 some genius stored away somewhere?

477
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:26,785
And if does, why not
 let him write SYNAPSE?

478
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:30,497
- I not saying if makes any sense...
 - Hey! Honey

479
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:34,293
Sesame Seeds.
 Jesus.

480
00:30:34,293 --> 00:30:38,380
Excuse me...
 Could you take that away, thank you

481
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,341
- I'm so stupid
 - Hey!

482
00:30:43,302 --> 00:30:45,596
He is a genius. Don't forget.

483
00:30:45,596 --> 00:30:50,309
If anybody other than you could 
 write this thing as quickly as you're saying

484
00:30:50,392 --> 00:30:53,770
wouldn't it maybe be him?
- Yes, yes, you are right,

485
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,773
The guy's a genius,
 SYNAPSE is all he cares about

486
00:30:56,773 --> 00:31:00,819
and I’m being over sensitive for a change

487
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:02,988
To geniuses

488
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:18,921
You know what?

489
00:31:18,921 --> 00:31:23,133
Sometimes it helps to get out of here.
 Just for an hour or so.

490
00:31:26,637 --> 00:31:28,347
Hey, Milo

491
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:30,224
Brain

492
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,228
Just dropped off my resume,
 Nearly got in the door.

493
00:31:34,228 --> 00:31:35,771
You're living up here now?

494
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:39,024
I'm systems administrator
 at the load public access station,

495
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:42,653
Where any whack Job
 with 100 bucks gets his own show.

496
00:31:43,195 --> 00:31:45,656
God is it suck.

497
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:49,284
Can you help me?

498
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:52,746
- Put it the word
- I'll see what I can do. Yeah

499
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,586
- Well, I’m parked illegally
 - Ok.

500
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:06,426
They pushed up all the schedules
 on the SYNAPSE's applications

501
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:08,136
How fast you go?

502
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:10,097
There is no second place.

503
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:14,351
Plus every time I get jammed up.
 Gary comes up with something.

504
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:18,188
Did uh... Gary give you a new design
 or something? - Yeah

505
00:32:18,188 --> 00:32:21,108
I must have offended him,
 'cause he a...

506
00:32:21,108 --> 00:32:24,111
he yelled at me.

507
00:32:24,111 --> 00:32:28,365
People don't ever just,
 like, hand you stuff

508
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:32,703
Maybe once.
 I reconfigured it anyway.

509
00:32:32,703 --> 00:32:34,621
You're compulsive.

510
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:15,746
Moments,

511
00:33:15,787 --> 00:33:17,414
precious moments
 that you want to hold

512
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:18,957
that you want to share,

513
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:21,210
at home, at school, at work.

514
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:25,047
You'll keep in touch with the one's
 you love through SYNAPSE

515
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:28,258
the first satellite delivered 
 global communications system

516
00:33:28,258 --> 00:33:34,264
Share live voices, music, pictures
 or video, data or text,

517
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:36,934
with anyone, anywhere, instantly...

518
00:33:36,934 --> 00:33:39,186
Look, Daddy

519
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:43,565
SYNAPSE links every
 communication device on the planet.

520
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:46,276
Because every moment matters.

521
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:56,078
I think you do

522
00:33:56,078 --> 00:34:00,958
- Hi, honey
 - Hi

523
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:02,876
I didn't expect ..ah..

524
00:34:06,004 --> 00:34:09,091
Uh.. Lisa this is my...
 this is Alice..

525
00:34:09,091 --> 00:34:14,137
Lisa is doing the user interfaces
 for SYNAPSE. - Oh

526
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:16,682
Hi

527
00:34:16,682 --> 00:34:20,102
Milo tells me
 you are a really great artist

528
00:34:20,102 --> 00:34:24,773
Oh, yeah he always exaggerates.

529
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:32,322
Well um, I got a lot to do..
 it was nice to meet you.

530
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,871
How are you?
 I'm so surprised

531
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:41,999
- Are you ok? Is everything alright?
 - Yeah yeah.

532
00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:46,128
No. I just wanted to come out
 and you know. ..see what these faces like.

533
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:48,630
- It's really good to see you.
 - Yeah.

534
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,053
What did the girl say?

535
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:58,098
There maybe a little less trust
 after you snapped at him

536
00:34:58,098 --> 00:35:02,769
- It hasn't effected his work though.
 - Nothing does.

537
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:04,646
It's pretty amazing.

538
00:35:18,535 --> 00:35:19,661
What's wrong?

539
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:22,122
Teddy's been killed.

540
00:36:13,549 --> 00:36:14,800
They've done this before.

541
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,970
Just never killed anybody until now.

542
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:20,430
But it's their writing
 on the wall

543
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:24,226
Their hate literature
 was scattered everywhere

544
00:36:24,226 --> 00:36:28,689
They hold MO, it's like they were
 asking to be caught.

545
00:36:28,689 --> 00:36:31,191
And they've been arrested twice
 for beating up Asians.

546
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:33,110
How come they weren't in jail?

547
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:36,446
People told us to be careful
 in this neighborhood.

548
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:38,782
I guess he didn't take them
 too seriously.

549
00:36:38,782 --> 00:36:41,869
Yeah. well.
 that's our problem.

550
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:45,372
We don't take anything seriously, do we?

551
00:36:45,372 --> 00:36:47,541
It's not on the hard drive.

552
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:11,607
Hey, I didn't know you guys
 were working with fiber optics.

553
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:32,878
We're just a bounch of crazy assholes.

554
00:37:34,296 --> 00:37:39,218
And he was on the verge of something.
 He was right there.

555
00:37:39,218 --> 00:37:41,678
He was going to show us the next day.

556
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,265
He told me, I should get the VC to line up
 appointment with a bunch of companies.

557
00:37:45,265 --> 00:37:47,017
You know.

558
00:37:47,017 --> 00:37:52,773
He said, the answer is not in the box.
 It's in the band.

559
00:37:54,316 --> 00:37:59,947
- You know I called him last week to uh...
 'cause... - I know.

560
00:37:59,947 --> 00:38:03,617
He was happy you did.

561
00:38:07,412 --> 00:38:08,705
Be strong, Larry

562
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:13,836
Milo.

563
00:38:15,504 --> 00:38:18,674
- May I join you?
 - Yeah

564
00:38:23,387 --> 00:38:25,806
Heard about what happened.

565
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:29,434
- I'm very sorry.
 - Thanks

566
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:32,855
Had you talked to him... much, lately?

567
00:38:32,855 --> 00:38:34,773
Just once.

568
00:38:34,773 --> 00:38:38,902
Things weren't that great between us
 and we couldn't talk about work

569
00:38:38,944 --> 00:38:40,821
because it was off limits.

570
00:38:43,115 --> 00:38:45,200
Did you have something
 you wanted to show me?

571
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:48,495
- Look. we can save it for another day.
 - No, it's okay. I..

572
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:50,706
it will help take my mind off things.

573
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:51,123
Really

574
00:38:51,123 --> 00:38:53,500
- Yeah. yeah
 - Okay.

575
00:38:55,961 --> 00:38:58,589
Well, I haven't been able to sleep all week.

576
00:38:58,589 --> 00:39:03,886
Thinking about the push mechanism in the handler.
 And then it just came to me.

577
00:39:03,886 --> 00:39:05,637
It's in the wrong place.

578
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:09,099
- The wrong place.
 - Yeah

579
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:15,063
The answer is not in the box.
 It's in the band.

580
00:39:15,063 --> 00:39:18,108
It's in the band.
 It's in the band.

581
00:39:49,932 --> 00:39:52,184
Hey, are you sure you're alright?

582
00:39:52,184 --> 00:39:54,728
I think I ate something,
 I gotta go.

583
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:16,083
Alice!

584
00:40:31,682 --> 00:40:33,600
Teddy was on to something
 very specific,

585
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,186
now he is dead. There's got to be
 a connection, Alice, I can feel it.

586
00:40:36,228 --> 00:40:37,145
So what are you saying?

587
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:39,189
You think they have something
 to do with Teddy's death

588
00:40:39,231 --> 00:40:39,940
I don't know what I am saying,

589
00:40:39,982 --> 00:40:41,775
all I know is
 all these ideas keep flying in.

590
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,986
He says that any kid working in his garage
 could put him out of business,

591
00:40:43,986 --> 00:40:46,196
It's almost like they know
 what every kid is doing.

592
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:47,990
They're hacking into people's computers.

593
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:50,951
I guess they can get into some people's 
 machines, but, not ..not Teddys.

594
00:40:50,993 --> 00:40:54,163
He always had the most paranoid
 firewalls to protect his data.

595
00:40:54,204 --> 00:40:57,875
They'd have to been like
 watching him physically

596
00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:00,460
Watching him physically.

597
00:41:01,003 --> 00:41:02,337
Oh shit

598
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:15,642
I think it is part of a camera

599
00:41:15,934 --> 00:41:18,228
Number 21 isn't just a broadcast studio.

600
00:41:18,228 --> 00:41:21,023
It's a surveillance post or something.
 That's why they have those disks on the roof.

601
00:41:21,023 --> 00:41:22,816
Milo, think about that you're saying,

602
00:41:22,816 --> 00:41:24,610
You honestly think that
 he would murder somebody?

603
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:25,986
I don't know,
 I gotta get in there

604
00:41:25,986 --> 00:41:28,071
There's over 20 buildings over there,
 and they all filled with computers

605
00:41:28,071 --> 00:41:29,781
No no no, this is the only one
 with disks on the roof

606
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:30,991
The studios a front,

607
00:41:30,991 --> 00:41:32,326
That's why they keep 
 postponing the opening.

608
00:41:32,326 --> 00:41:34,453
Ok, now you're scaring me.

609
00:41:34,453 --> 00:41:35,662
Do you wanna just go?

610
00:41:35,662 --> 00:41:38,123
'Cause we can go,
 you wanna just... leave

611
00:41:38,123 --> 00:41:40,542
Go where, go where Alice?
 You can't get away from people like this!

612
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:42,419
People like this.
 This is Gary you are talking about

613
00:41:42,461 --> 00:41:44,379
You don't think I know that?

614
00:41:45,923 --> 00:41:48,050
They're under investigation
 by the Justice Department

615
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:50,802
I mean, you said yourself that
 there are guys showing up all the time.

616
00:41:50,802 --> 00:41:54,056
Then how could they possibly hope
 on hiding a surveillance force,

617
00:41:54,056 --> 00:41:57,059
How could they hope on hiding anything,
 You can't get in there anyway,

618
00:41:57,059 --> 00:42:00,187
they have swipe cards, they have cameras,
 I mean it's like Fort Knox for christ sakes

619
00:42:00,187 --> 00:42:02,105
I'm implicated, I’m implicated Alice
 No, you're not - Yes, I am.

620
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:03,815
- No, you're not
 - No

621
00:42:03,815 --> 00:42:05,400
Yes, who's been using this code, huh?

622
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,361
Teddy's code.
 Whoever code this is. I have,

623
00:42:07,361 --> 00:42:09,488
how do you think that makes me feel?
 This is my best friend,

624
00:42:09,488 --> 00:42:10,614
You need to calm down, now

625
00:42:10,614 --> 00:42:13,575
- I can't just walk away from this
 - Yeah, but you can't just walk in either.

626
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:21,583
- You're right
 - Yeah

627
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:24,211
You're right

628
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:26,672
Uh.. the construction is 
 finished by 6 or 7,

629
00:42:26,672 --> 00:42:29,049
the parking lot is cleared
 by 2 or 3 in the morning.

630
00:42:29,049 --> 00:42:30,884
Even the earliest geeks don't get is till 5.

631
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:32,052
Honey, what are you talking about?

632
00:42:32,052 --> 00:42:33,387
What, what are you saying right now?

633
00:42:33,387 --> 00:42:34,638
Listen to me, I thinking about

634
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:36,640
how I gotta get in there
 and find out what the hell is going on.

635
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,016
Okay but was it true or was it true,

636
00:42:38,016 --> 00:42:41,228
did you ever really notice,
 you're just sounding like a mad man.

637
00:42:41,228 --> 00:42:42,688
I won't pretend like
 everything is okay, Alice

638
00:42:42,688 --> 00:42:44,982
that's how I got into this mess

639
00:42:47,234 --> 00:42:48,986
I, just tell like..

640
00:42:48,986 --> 00:42:50,195
Alice listen, listen,

641
00:42:50,195 --> 00:42:53,782
I'm not, I don't mean to, 
 I’m not mad at you, listen to me,

642
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:56,326
I think I can figure out
 a way to get in there.

643
00:42:56,326 --> 00:42:59,538
But I can't do it on my own,
 so I need you to help me.

644
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:05,085
What am I to do ?

645
00:43:05,794 --> 00:43:07,921
So you believe me?

646
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:10,591
Just tell me what to do.

647
00:43:51,298 --> 00:43:55,677
Whoa, whoa , whoa, Whoa, Sir,
 you got to use your own. Where's your ID?

648
00:43:59,056 --> 00:44:02,017
I caught him tailgating. Building 20.

649
00:44:13,403 --> 00:44:16,448
These cards are your own responsibility

650
00:44:29,419 --> 00:44:33,549
- There was an explosion in the closet
 in buiding 12
 - What?

651
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:40,013
Hey, you can't wander around without ID,
 just park your ass in that chair

652
00:46:35,587 --> 00:46:38,173
Well, what can I tell ya ?
 It's pretty basic operation guide

653
00:46:38,173 --> 00:46:42,177
You got your time clock, fuse goes in here
 you just hook it in the switch over here

654
00:46:42,177 --> 00:46:43,303
So, what we got here Bob?

655
00:46:43,303 --> 00:46:46,306
Some glorified cherry bomb,
 some geeks' idea of fun.

656
00:46:46,306 --> 00:46:48,225
I've been saying
 we need a camera in this hall

657
00:46:48,225 --> 00:46:50,727
To protect what,
 the mops?

658
00:46:50,727 --> 00:46:52,312
somebody is pulling the chain again Bob.

659
00:46:52,312 --> 00:46:55,107
Unless it's a diversion,
 Milo Hoffman is in my office.

660
00:46:55,107 --> 00:46:58,861
- He was tailgating
 - Bob. Milo is not just another geek

661
00:46:58,861 --> 00:47:02,781
He is very important to Gary,
 So let's not go there, all right?

662
00:47:03,949 --> 00:47:06,034
Okay, we'll see you later

663
00:47:52,748 --> 00:47:55,292
Is everything okay, Bob?

664
00:48:11,016 --> 00:48:13,310
- Hey!

665
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:15,103
- Hi Gary

666
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:18,857
- Working kinda late, huh?
 - Yeah , uh..

667
00:48:18,857 --> 00:48:22,945
- Can I take a look ?
 - Yeah

668
00:48:25,447 --> 00:48:29,868
- Oh, that’s nice. That's excellent.
 - Thanks.

669
00:48:29,868 --> 00:48:32,287
You seem kinda jumpy, Milo.

670
00:48:32,287 --> 00:48:37,543
No. I'm just a.... I'm a little surprised 
 to see you out here, now.

671
00:48:37,543 --> 00:48:43,048
Well, I like to sneak in late at night sometimes
 to see who the obsessive ones are

672
00:48:46,593 --> 00:48:49,012
Don't work too late.

673
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,140
I got my eye on you

674
00:49:44,985 --> 00:49:47,488
- How's it going?
 - Big night

675
00:49:47,488 --> 00:49:50,324
switched from tea to coffee.

676
00:49:50,324 --> 00:49:52,534
Brought new meaning to my work.

677
00:51:25,919 --> 00:51:30,007
Well, now he knows.
 Nothing in there.

678
00:51:30,007 --> 00:51:33,677
- Maybe he'll get back to work now.
 - Yeah, copy that.

679
00:51:33,677 --> 00:51:36,930
- Speaking of which.
 - Okay. I'm on my way back.

680
00:54:48,121 --> 00:54:52,084
- Did you download code San Jose.
 - Oh shit.

681
00:54:52,084 --> 00:54:53,335
I'll do it.

682
00:54:54,878 --> 00:54:58,382
- Shame we can't just walk in the front door.
 - Yeah, wouldn't Bob love that.

683
00:59:20,477 --> 00:59:21,478
Ooh!

684
00:59:25,482 --> 00:59:26,984
Jesus

685
01:01:53,672 --> 01:01:55,674
Yes, I gonna need a thorough background check.

686
01:01:55,674 --> 01:01:57,467
I want to know every organization

687
01:01:57,467 --> 01:02:00,179
he's been involved with, church groups, all..

688
01:02:00,179 --> 01:02:01,847
- Ahh, Mr. Barton?
 - Yes

689
01:02:01,847 --> 01:02:04,057
Excuse me, uh..

690
01:02:04,057 --> 01:02:05,893
do you remember me?

691
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:06,894
Meelo, isn't it?

692
01:02:06,894 --> 01:02:08,312
- Milo
 - Milo

693
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,522
I really need to talk to you Sir, like..

694
01:02:10,522 --> 01:02:13,275
Right, uh.. give me a few seconds
 with Lasy here

695
01:02:13,275 --> 01:02:14,276
you can go into my office

696
01:02:14,276 --> 01:02:16,945
I won't be late but a moment

697
01:02:43,388 --> 01:02:44,389
- Milo

698
01:02:44,389 --> 01:02:47,518
Hey! uh.. Yeah!

699
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:49,186
Thank you for seeing me, Sir

700
01:02:49,269 --> 01:02:53,774
- No problem, have a seat
 - I’m ok.

701
01:02:54,608 --> 01:02:56,276
You look a little upset

702
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,779
I am Sir, I am

703
01:02:59,279 --> 01:03:02,324
What's the problem, son

704
01:03:02,533 --> 01:03:04,618
Ah..well,

705
01:03:04,618 --> 01:03:08,664
my friend, my best friend Teddy

706
01:03:08,664 --> 01:03:12,292
He was killed in Silicon Valley and I..I thought

707
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:14,962
maybe there is some way
 l could help find the suspects

708
01:03:14,962 --> 01:03:17,297
- You mean Teddy Chan
 - Yes, Sir

709
01:03:17,297 --> 01:03:21,677
Well, I guess you didn't see
 the 11 o’clock news last night

710
01:03:21,677 --> 01:03:25,514
San Jose police picked up a suspect
 and they're holding them without bail

711
01:03:25,514 --> 01:03:28,475
That's great.

712
01:03:28,475 --> 01:03:34,982
 That's um.. I hope I'll sleep better tonight

713
01:03:34,982 --> 01:03:41,947
Well um, I’m a little disappointed
 I thought that you decided to join our side.

714
01:03:41,947 --> 01:03:49,580
No Sir, no, I’m a real happy there at NURV.
 but um..

715
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:52,541
Thank you 
 and thank you for your time.

716
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:57,921
- So he didn't mention he was going to
 the Justice Department? - No

717
01:03:57,921 --> 01:03:59,715
You're not losing your hold on him,
 are you, Rebecca?

718
01:03:59,715 --> 01:04:01,341
Don't forget your part of the deal.

719
01:04:01,341 --> 01:04:02,968
You got a very good thing going here.

720
01:04:02,968 --> 01:04:05,053
Phill, he'll tell me
 when he gets back.

721
01:04:05,053 --> 01:04:07,598
Well, that will be the test,
 won't it?

722
01:04:09,057 --> 01:04:10,100
 Prick

723
01:04:24,531 --> 01:04:29,244
It's l0 o’clock,
 I’ve been so worried about you

724
01:04:29,244 --> 01:04:30,704
What did you see in there?

725
01:04:30,704 --> 01:04:34,291
- Nothing. 
 - Nothing?

726
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:36,627
It's exactly what they said it is,

727
01:04:36,627 --> 01:04:38,629
an unfinished broadcast studio

728
01:04:42,591 --> 01:04:45,552
You know, I think I’ve been
 putting my own guilt on Gary

729
01:04:45,552 --> 01:04:47,262
Guilt?

730
01:04:47,262 --> 01:04:51,266
Yeah. If I’ve done the start up, 
 Maybe Teddy would still be alive.

731
01:04:51,266 --> 01:04:54,478
Or maybe you would be dead, too.

732
01:04:54,478 --> 01:04:58,023
Anyway, I figure instead of evolving 
 all these paranoid delusions

733
01:04:58,023 --> 01:05:02,194
and scaring you
 I should do something useful with my grief.

734
01:05:02,444 --> 01:05:07,908
So I went to see that guy Barton at the DOJ.
 Do you remember him?

735
01:05:07,908 --> 01:05:09,201
Yeah

736
01:05:09,201 --> 01:05:11,537
I wanted to see if I could help him
 find Teddy's killers

737
01:05:11,537 --> 01:05:15,374
and it turns out they got 
 the guys last night so..

738
01:05:16,583 --> 01:05:19,920
I have been so worried about you

739
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,172
You were right
 to let him break into 21

740
01:05:22,172 --> 01:05:24,633
He felt pretty foolish afterwards

741
01:05:24,633 --> 01:05:28,011
He said it was all to do
 with his own guilt you know.

742
01:05:28,011 --> 01:05:30,973
Not being there.
 No doing the start up

743
01:05:30,973 --> 01:05:32,933
I mean his best friend was just killed.

744
01:05:32,933 --> 01:05:36,937
You're convinced he is completely focused
 on SYNAPSE again.

745
01:05:36,937 --> 01:05:39,314
- He's not acting? 
 - No

746
01:05:39,314 --> 01:05:42,025
he is pretty honest with his feelings

747
01:05:42,025 --> 01:05:47,072
I don't think he knows how to act. 
 Alright?

748
01:05:47,072 --> 01:05:48,991
Good.
 That's all for now.

749
01:05:48,991 --> 01:05:50,826
Lisa, I had to tell someone.

750
01:05:50,868 --> 01:05:52,619
They know everything
 about everybody.

751
01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:54,830
There're stealing code
 from all over the place.

752
01:05:54,830 --> 01:05:57,624
And sometimes, if someone gets ahead
 of them, like Teddy

753
01:05:57,624 --> 01:05:59,251
- It's all undetectable.
 - What?

754
01:05:59,251 --> 01:06:02,337
The crimes are hand tailored.
 These guys are in the information business.

755
01:06:02,337 --> 01:06:04,798
It's a Chinese guy, frame a local racist.

756
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:07,593
Plus, I’m sure
 Gary has maximum deniability.

757
01:06:07,593 --> 01:06:08,969
He tells his people,

758
01:06:08,969 --> 01:06:10,721
surprise me, solve the problem,
 defy me,

759
01:06:10,721 --> 01:06:12,431
they turn around and tell the next 
 person the same things.

760
01:06:12,431 --> 01:06:15,309
That sounds crazy why would he 
 put himself on the line like that?

761
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:15,893
SYNAPSE
 SYNAPSE

762
01:06:15,893 --> 01:06:16,560
SYNAPSE
 SYNAPSE

763
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,103
the guy has invested billions
 on getting there first.

764
01:06:18,103 --> 01:06:20,731
He will do anything to get his date
 He has to....

765
01:06:20,731 --> 01:06:25,944
Lisa, they killed my best friend

766
01:06:25,944 --> 01:06:27,112
Maybe others

767
01:06:27,112 --> 01:06:29,406
I'm living with someone
 they pay to sleep with me

768
01:06:29,406 --> 01:06:32,701
- we have to do something 
- Like what, what could we possibly do

769
01:06:32,701 --> 01:06:34,828
I don't know yet. But we 
 are one step ahead of them

770
01:06:34,828 --> 01:06:37,206
they don't know I’ve been in the 
 Daycare center, Just 21.

771
01:06:37,206 --> 01:06:41,084
They let me do that. 
 That's all they know though.

772
01:06:44,588 --> 01:06:45,631
Lisa

773
01:06:49,384 --> 01:06:50,302
Lisa!

774
01:06:50,302 --> 01:06:52,679
I'm sorry, Milo

775
01:06:52,679 --> 01:06:54,932
Alright? I'm sorry

776
01:07:05,067 --> 01:07:08,237
Lisa, I know why
 you won't let anyone near you.

777
01:07:17,913 --> 01:07:19,915
I know what he did to you

778
01:07:26,171 --> 01:07:28,966
If you leave now,
 you could be in danger

779
01:07:29,883 --> 01:07:31,802
They would use my step father

780
01:07:31,802 --> 01:07:34,388
They could frame him
 if they had too, yeah.

781
01:07:45,983 --> 01:07:47,234
What about the FBI?

782
01:07:47,234 --> 01:07:48,777
Too risky

783
01:07:48,777 --> 01:07:52,948
I went to the DOJ, but they got a guy
 on payroll over there, maybe others.

784
01:07:52,948 --> 01:07:56,160
Who knows who there're paying?

785
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,786
Well, who can we trust?

786
01:07:57,786 --> 01:08:00,956
I mean how do you let go of a secret
 without telling the wrong person?

787
01:08:00,956 --> 01:08:02,291
I don't know

788
01:08:06,712 --> 01:08:08,797
We tell everybody at once

789
01:08:08,797 --> 01:08:10,883
See, that way there is no secret
 left to protect.

790
01:08:10,883 --> 01:08:13,427
If everybody knows,
 they can't touch us.

791
01:08:13,427 --> 01:08:14,720
Right

792
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:20,767
What about 60 minutes?

793
01:08:25,898 --> 01:08:28,066
CBS news is partnered
 with NURV information system

794
01:08:28,066 --> 01:08:32,946
in a cable news network
 due to launch Fall of June,2001

795
01:08:33,489 --> 01:08:39,786
AOL-Time Warner has a 40% stake in
 Gary's setup device and it also takes out CNN..

796
01:08:39,786 --> 01:08:43,207
Disney Join NURV's adventure
 ABC is out

797
01:08:43,207 --> 01:08:46,919
Look, any of these places
 could a more or all of them

798
01:08:49,546 --> 01:08:51,215
- Wait
  - What?

799
01:08:51,215 --> 01:08:53,967
How close are you to finishing SYNAPSE?

800
01:08:53,967 --> 01:08:55,761
He's got all the satellites up.

801
01:08:55,761 --> 01:09:01,391
There's dishes on top of 21.
 He's building this mega network just for SYNAPSE.

802
01:09:01,391 --> 01:09:04,520
We can connect to everybody
 on every device simultaneously.

803
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:07,147
That's what SYNAPSE is

804
01:09:08,023 --> 01:09:11,068
That's what we'll use ...

805
01:09:11,068 --> 01:09:11,985
Got him.

806
01:09:17,282 --> 01:09:21,203
So what's in the Daycare Center is
 a top of raw material that's all over the place

807
01:09:21,203 --> 01:09:23,914
What I need you to do is
 design some kind of a graphic format

808
01:09:23,914 --> 01:09:26,458
so people could follow
 what there're seeing

809
01:09:26,458 --> 01:09:27,167
No problem

810
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:30,128
- Shit 
 - What?

811
01:09:30,128 --> 01:09:32,798
I would have to get into Gary's house
 to get the satellite address.

812
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:35,592
He's running the whole thing
 from his work phone.

813
01:09:35,592 --> 01:09:36,844
You mean break in?

814
01:09:36,844 --> 01:09:38,595
I don't know,
 I don't know...

815
01:09:38,595 --> 01:09:41,098
And what if the dishes
 on top of 21 aren't hot yet

816
01:09:41,098 --> 01:09:43,392
the place isn't even finished.

817
01:09:44,017 --> 01:09:46,645
I'll go up

818
01:09:46,645 --> 01:09:48,021
You're not afraid?

819
01:09:58,073 --> 01:10:00,534
testing.. UPLINK ACTIVE..

820
01:10:00,534 --> 01:10:02,369
Welcome back to Good morning Portland

821
01:10:02,369 --> 01:10:06,248
This Thursday, 50 of Portland's 
 elite couples will attend

822
01:10:06,248 --> 01:10:09,168
a gala party at the home of
 Gary Clarisa Winston

823
01:10:09,168 --> 01:10:11,587
to raise money
 for the Portland Art museum.

824
01:10:11,587 --> 01:10:13,422
Julie is at the museum.

825
01:10:13,422 --> 01:10:17,050
Last year party's goers pledged over
 2 million dollars for this museum.

826
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:18,969
- Look at this
 - What?

827
01:10:18,969 --> 01:10:22,639
Why doesn’t he invite us to his party 
 He's never even met you.

828
01:10:22,639 --> 01:10:24,725
Milo, he has thousands of employees

829
01:10:24,725 --> 01:10:25,767
I know Alice

830
01:10:25,767 --> 01:10:28,312
But this is for the art 
 museum and you're an artist.

831
01:10:28,312 --> 01:10:30,898
- If anybody should be invited, you should
- Ah, hum

832
01:10:34,151 --> 01:10:36,528
This is not at line feed.

833
01:10:36,528 --> 01:10:40,115
This is play back from some other day 
 It's been messed with

834
01:10:40,115 --> 01:10:43,118
- We call Randy and Phil? 
 - Not yet.

835
01:10:43,118 --> 01:10:47,331
I'll have to bust my ass
 because I’m not a frementra

836
01:10:47,331 --> 01:10:51,084
I swear to god it's that kid Milo

837
01:10:51,084 --> 01:10:54,588
Let's run a check on card entries.
 Go back two weeks.

838
01:10:58,217 --> 01:11:00,093
Skull Box, Larry speaking

839
01:11:00,093 --> 01:11:02,012
Hey Larry, it's Milo

840
01:11:02,012 --> 01:11:02,971
Hey buddy

841
01:11:02,971 --> 01:11:07,184
- How's it going 
 - a... I'm good.

842
01:11:07,184 --> 01:11:08,936
I'm ah.., back in the garage

843
01:11:08,936 --> 01:11:12,022
Didn't want to stay at that other place

844
01:11:12,022 --> 01:11:13,565
what's up?

845
01:11:15,776 --> 01:11:17,861
Milo?

846
01:11:17,861 --> 01:11:20,614
you there?

847
01:11:20,614 --> 01:11:22,533
Larry, you got a second.

848
01:11:22,533 --> 01:11:24,868
I might your help with something

849
01:11:24,868 --> 01:11:27,079
You bet man, name it.

850
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:35,587
Milo

851
01:11:35,170 --> 01:11:37,714
Giving a benefit for the 
 art museum Thursday night and

852
01:11:37,714 --> 01:11:39,716
I thought you might like to bring Alice.

853
01:11:39,716 --> 01:11:41,802
That's great. Thank you.

854
01:11:41,802 --> 01:11:43,846
Sorry about the late notice.

855
01:12:08,704 --> 01:12:11,331
You went into 21 twice
 without coming out.

856
01:12:11,331 --> 01:12:13,375
You came out twice
 without going back in

857
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:16,003
who are you, Harry Hudinny?

858
01:12:16,003 --> 01:12:18,380
No, No, No, this things is screwed up.
 Look

859
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:20,465
it also got me going
 into daycare that night.

860
01:12:20,465 --> 01:12:22,301
Daycare center is not in your tour

861
01:12:22,301 --> 01:12:24,344
Exactly, I’ve never been in there

862
01:12:28,015 --> 01:12:31,310
Milo, we're late.
 I'm coming I ah.., just gotta ah..

863
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:33,562
find some scissors for this um...

864
01:14:08,407 --> 01:14:13,036
They call the house. They ask if you..

865
01:14:23,547 --> 01:14:25,924
- Alice, I’m Gary
- Hi

866
01:14:25,924 --> 01:14:26,884
This is my wife Clarisa.

867
01:14:26,884 --> 01:14:29,094
Alice, hello

868
01:14:29,094 --> 01:14:31,263
- Gary tells me you are an artist.
- Yes I am.

869
01:14:31,263 --> 01:14:34,558
Milo, this is Barry Linden.
 He's visiting us from Hollywood.

870
01:14:34,558 --> 01:14:38,896
- Barry's studio is going to help us fill the SYNAPE pipeline
 - Oh, good

871
01:14:38,896 --> 01:14:41,398
Marketing implication epic.

872
01:14:41,398 --> 01:14:43,150
Kids are watching a movie

873
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:45,569
points and clicks
 at the laser blaster

874
01:14:45,569 --> 01:14:48,906
and before the real is even over,

875
01:14:48,906 --> 01:14:53,869
he's bought the toy... to hell with story,
 how many toys can you sell

876
01:14:53,869 --> 01:14:56,580
what about the arts?

877
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:59,208
The only art left in America
 is business.

878
01:14:59,208 --> 01:15:01,919
And you are standing
 in the venchee's house

879
01:15:01,919 --> 01:15:03,670
Excuse me, where is the bathroom?

880
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:05,547
It's just around the corner
 - Thank you

881
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:42,830
You left the party to work?

882
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:46,250
I got inspired

883
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:50,712
I, I didn't want to forget it, 
 so I came here to write it down

884
01:17:50,712 --> 01:17:53,006
I'm sorry if I was rude.

885
01:18:01,348 --> 01:18:06,103
I know what you're doing

886
01:18:06,103 --> 01:18:10,107
I just want to know that it 
 is not affecting your work

887
01:18:10,107 --> 01:18:12,401
I don't know what you men

888
01:18:12,401 --> 01:18:15,154
Milo, I’m not blind

889
01:18:15,154 --> 01:18:17,948
Lisa is very attractive young woman.

890
01:18:17,948 --> 01:18:19,658
God knows and

891
01:18:19,658 --> 01:18:22,202
your private life is your own.

892
01:18:22,202 --> 01:18:24,830
But we are very close
 to our launch date.

893
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:28,333
and I need you to keep
 your eye on the ball.

894
01:18:28,333 --> 01:18:32,004
- I understand Gary
- Good

895
01:18:32,004 --> 01:18:34,715
Let's go have a drink

896
01:18:44,641 --> 01:18:46,894
Hit the back slash, hit the colon.

897
01:18:46,894 --> 01:18:49,897
Keys kids don't use but geeks do.

898
01:18:49,897 --> 01:18:51,523
What would Milo want in here anyway?

899
01:18:51,523 --> 01:18:53,984
They know.
 Just don't trust me with it,

900
01:18:53,984 --> 01:18:56,236
so we will get
 the evidence first,

901
01:18:56,236 --> 01:18:59,698
ask questions later, here,
 get started on that one

902
01:19:12,211 --> 01:19:13,921
What if he knows what we are doing.

903
01:19:13,921 --> 01:19:15,547
Do you think he is toying with us??

904
01:19:15,547 --> 01:19:17,925
- How much time do you need?
- Two days

905
01:19:17,925 --> 01:19:19,718
Now did you write the code
 to sequence the video files?

906
01:19:19,718 --> 01:19:21,804
Yes and the audio is done.

907
01:19:21,804 --> 01:19:25,265
The text file feeds
 your voice synchronizer

908
01:19:29,478 --> 01:19:31,939
Hey, you're back

909
01:19:31,939 --> 01:19:33,774
I bought a hu-din cook book.

910
01:19:33,774 --> 01:19:37,236
'Cause we're always afraid for you eating
 in Chinese restaurants

911
01:19:37,236 --> 01:19:43,951
I've been mincing and chopping things
 into tinny weenie pieces all afternoon

912
01:19:43,951 --> 01:19:45,369
But you never cook

913
01:19:45,369 --> 01:19:46,578
I know

914
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:52,125
I'm gonna go change

915
01:21:12,456 --> 01:21:14,291
no escaping

916
01:21:17,461 --> 01:21:20,422
- You look beautiful
- Thank you

917
01:21:31,934 --> 01:21:33,227
Milo

918
01:21:35,687 --> 01:21:38,273
Ah, I'm gonna go upstairs and get changed

919
01:21:38,273 --> 01:21:40,484
I love the way you look

920
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:42,903
Thanks

921
01:21:48,534 --> 01:21:51,036
Hey, do we have any chopsticks?

922
01:21:51,036 --> 01:21:52,079
Yeah

923
01:22:30,033 --> 01:22:31,076
Great

924
01:22:33,912 --> 01:22:36,081
Wait, um....

925
01:22:36,081 --> 01:22:39,459
right, a toast.

926
01:22:50,971 --> 01:22:52,764
To a long life

927
01:23:44,107 --> 01:23:47,986
- Is it good?
- It's delicious

928
01:23:47,986 --> 01:23:50,739
Yeah

929
01:23:50,739 --> 01:23:53,200
There's something 
 that I need to tell you

930
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:54,159
What?

931
01:23:59,998 --> 01:24:01,792
I love you

932
01:24:11,969 --> 01:24:14,429
- Rebecca
 - Yeah

933
01:24:34,324 --> 01:24:40,205
Come on, Come on, Come on,
 see.

934
01:24:40,205 --> 01:24:41,915
Who needs computers

935
01:24:49,131 --> 01:24:54,636
Gary believe me,
 I am looking at his prints right now.

936
01:24:54,636 --> 01:24:57,681
You want Phil to handle it.

937
01:24:57,681 --> 01:24:59,683
Whatever you say.

938
01:24:59,933 --> 01:25:01,185
Bastards!

939
01:26:05,791 --> 01:26:06,959
Oh no,

940
01:26:06,959 --> 01:26:09,586
you don't get by me twice kid !

941
01:26:12,214 --> 01:26:15,050
- You gonna call Gary? 
- Screw Gray?

942
01:26:38,907 --> 01:26:41,118
Bob, these guys are criminals.

943
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:45,581
Now, I am gonna go out on a limb here

944
01:26:45,581 --> 01:26:49,585
because there's very good chance that you're
 not gonna believe a word of what I’m about to tell you.

945
01:26:53,589 --> 01:26:57,092
You'd be surprised what I believe
 about these people

946
01:26:58,635 --> 01:27:00,637
Show me what you got there

947
01:27:27,623 --> 01:27:29,416
- Milo
 - Get your laptop. We're going tonight.

948
01:27:29,416 --> 01:27:31,001
You said two days

949
01:27:31,001 --> 01:27:32,961
So, I’m a genius

950
01:27:40,219 --> 01:27:41,929
- We're not ready.
 - Yes, we are - You said two days

951
01:27:41,929 --> 01:27:44,598
Lisa, you gotta trust me, okay?

952
01:27:44,598 --> 01:27:46,934
I need you to trust me

953
01:27:47,935 --> 01:27:48,852
Okay

954
01:27:51,730 --> 01:27:53,649
All right

955
01:27:53,649 --> 01:27:59,154
He left campus,
 he taken some surveillance data with him

956
01:27:59,154 --> 01:28:00,364
Don't worry,

957
01:28:00,364 --> 01:28:01,490
we know where he is

958
01:28:35,023 --> 01:28:37,234
Is Brain here?
 Brain Vissel ?

959
01:28:37,234 --> 01:28:38,694
Who wants to see him?

960
01:28:45,242 --> 01:28:47,536
What's going on here?
 You sounded insane on the phone.

961
01:28:47,536 --> 01:28:49,621
We need to do a live broadcast, right now.

962
01:28:49,621 --> 01:28:51,748
You can't, preempt yoga
 that's our biggest show

963
01:28:51,748 --> 01:28:54,293
Brain, you want to be
 a big deal in life, right?

964
01:28:54,293 --> 01:28:55,752
That's your dream, isn't it?

965
01:28:56,086 --> 01:28:57,462
Will it mean
 I will get to work for NURV?

966
01:28:57,462 --> 01:28:58,630
After this,
 there won't be a NURV.

967
01:28:58,630 --> 01:29:00,215
We're ganna bring him down
 and you're going to help us

968
01:29:00,215 --> 01:29:04,303
- That's the most insane thing I ever..
- Come on, man, what have they ever done for you?

969
01:29:06,555 --> 01:29:08,307
- Okay
- Great

970
01:29:09,099 --> 01:29:10,684
You wanna be a part of history?

971
01:29:10,684 --> 01:29:13,437
- Not really
- All right,

972
01:29:15,981 --> 01:29:18,025
how about, not sure.. 132 bucks.

973
01:29:27,534 --> 01:29:30,329
Forward your hands behind your back.

974
01:29:30,329 --> 01:29:38,253
Lift the stardom bone, lift the arms,
 through the hip... slowly

975
01:29:53,393 --> 01:29:56,396
- You're interfaced with the dish
 - ok

976
01:29:56,396 --> 01:29:58,690
Read me these IP addresses
 starting with number one.

977
01:29:58,899 --> 01:29:59,942
Wait..

978
01:30:01,193 --> 01:30:03,445
Phil, come over here,
 it's almost 10 o’clock,

979
01:30:03,445 --> 01:30:05,531
- we're going to shutdown
 the mother satellites. 
 - What?

980
01:30:05,531 --> 01:30:08,283
Read me the IP addresses
 starting with one - Gary

981
01:30:08,283 --> 01:30:10,619
Just do it, Phil

982
01:30:10,619 --> 01:30:12,955
It's gone way too far already.

983
01:30:22,131 --> 01:30:23,465
Go!
 Go!

984
01:30:23,465 --> 01:30:24,925
10.
10.

985
01:30:24,925 --> 01:30:26,009
24.

986
01:30:26,009 --> 01:30:27,511
53.

987
01:30:27,511 --> 01:30:29,054
192.
192.

988
01:30:38,188 --> 01:30:40,399
Come on, come on..
 Come on, come on..

989
01:30:52,161 --> 01:30:54,496
It's your software?
 Is it your dish?

990
01:30:54,496 --> 01:30:56,582
Alright, number 2
 Go

991
01:30:56,582 --> 01:30:58,584
Give me number 2

992
01:30:58,584 --> 01:31:00,502
Milo, you got some weird
 looking guys just pulled in !

993
01:31:00,502 --> 01:31:03,714
Brain, don't worry about it.
 Just give me number 2

994
01:31:03,714 --> 01:31:04,840
10.

995
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:05,549
43.

996
01:31:05,549 --> 01:31:06,049
84.

997
01:31:06,049 --> 01:31:07,426
143.

998
01:31:15,434 --> 01:31:16,643
Come on, come on..

999
01:31:20,898 --> 01:31:22,608
Damn it

1000
01:31:30,073 --> 01:31:31,283
Okay, get out of the hell!!

1001
01:31:32,618 --> 01:31:34,703
- Checked your connection?
 - Yes

1002
01:31:34,703 --> 01:31:36,497
- He knows
 - What?

1003
01:31:36,497 --> 01:31:38,123
He's shutting down
 the satellites one step ahead

1004
01:31:38,123 --> 01:31:40,918
Go to the end.
 Give me number 12

1005
01:31:40,918 --> 01:31:44,797
- 42.
 - Wait,

1006
01:31:44,797 --> 01:31:46,340
he knows I am shutting them down

1007
01:31:46,423 --> 01:31:49,301
 -What? 
 - I know how his mind works

1008
01:31:49,301 --> 01:31:50,969
Give me the last one, Number 12

1009
01:31:50,969 --> 01:31:53,180
- Gary
 - Just do it!

1010
01:31:55,849 --> 01:31:57,184
Ah, give me number 5

1011
01:31:59,853 --> 01:32:01,855
48., 29.

1012
01:32:01,855 --> 01:32:02,731
Hurry up, hurry up
 230.

1013
01:32:02,731 --> 01:32:04,566
Open the door Milo!

1014
01:32:04,566 --> 01:32:06,985
One more second

1015
01:32:15,202 --> 01:32:19,706
Guys, we're okay.
 Got it under control

1016
01:32:22,709 --> 01:32:24,920
Give us the disks Milo,
 come on!

1017
01:32:27,256 --> 01:32:30,259
The disks, Milo, now.
 come on, it's over

1018
01:32:57,828 --> 01:32:59,955
Hey, hey, asshole!

1019
01:33:40,829 --> 01:33:44,583
What's with the mission impossible 3,
 bull shit, Milo ?

1020
01:33:44,583 --> 01:33:46,210
You're a geek

1021
01:33:49,713 --> 01:33:52,049
Excellent!

1022
01:33:52,049 --> 01:33:54,968
They'll be back here in five minutes
 with Milo and the disk.

1023
01:33:54,968 --> 01:33:56,261
Good

1024
01:33:57,012 --> 01:33:58,764
What do you want to do with him?

1025
01:34:01,683 --> 01:34:03,769
Surprise me.

1026
01:34:07,815 --> 01:34:10,984
Ok, Mr. Schride,
 I need the disk that Milo gave you

1027
01:34:14,571 --> 01:34:17,282
You got something 
 non-geeky I can do?

1028
01:34:17,282 --> 01:34:20,786
- Yeah, we're gonna need a TV set in here
 - You got it

1029
01:34:42,224 --> 01:34:44,852
So what are you typing
 in there, Larry?

1030
01:34:44,852 --> 01:34:48,230
IP address, it's like calling 
 up a satellites on the phone

1031
01:34:48,230 --> 01:34:51,525
The first two haven't picked up.
 Come on pick up man.

1032
01:35:04,663 --> 01:35:06,623
Thank you

1033
01:35:06,623 --> 01:35:08,375
And thank you.

1034
01:35:08,375 --> 01:35:11,920
You have achieved a miraculous thing

1035
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:13,797
I'm so proud of you

1036
01:35:13,797 --> 01:35:15,257
Forgive me of my method's but

1037
01:35:15,257 --> 01:35:19,803
when you got off courses, we had to
 motivate you to keep working on SYNAPSE

1038
01:35:19,803 --> 01:35:21,847
Without Lisa here urgings you on,

1039
01:35:21,847 --> 01:35:23,307
We might not have made it

1040
01:35:23,307 --> 01:35:24,433
It's true, Milo,

1041
01:35:24,433 --> 01:35:26,810
what we have done is so important.

1042
01:35:30,481 --> 01:35:33,317
Oh my god.
 What?

1043
01:35:33,650 --> 01:35:35,319
Oh my god.

1044
01:35:41,992 --> 01:35:43,494
Gary

1045
01:36:16,652 --> 01:36:19,905
Who's got SYNAPSE, Milo?

1046
01:36:19,905 --> 01:36:23,367
Does that mean we did it?
 Does this mean we did it?

1047
01:36:25,869 --> 01:36:27,454
Wow, yeah man

1048
01:36:27,454 --> 01:36:30,082
That's what I’m talking about, 
 - That's fantastic!!

1049
01:36:30,082 --> 01:36:31,834
Yeah, you're Jim brooklin
 a never seen us coming and

1050
01:36:31,834 --> 01:36:33,377
were coming

1051
01:36:33,377 --> 01:36:38,382
Consumers don't care where new ideas come from
 just so long as they're offered at a competitive price,

1052
01:36:38,382 --> 01:36:40,259
the Software business violent.

1053
01:36:40,259 --> 01:36:43,011
There're a one or a zero,
 alive or dead

1054
01:36:43,011 --> 01:36:46,807
You're a one or a zero.
 Alive or dead, or dead

1055
01:36:46,807 --> 01:36:49,935
We do have a monopoly,
 we do have a monopoly here.

1056
01:36:49,935 --> 01:36:52,855
Those who don't innovate are doomed

1057
01:36:52,855 --> 01:36:54,189
to die doomed to die.

1058
01:36:54,189 --> 01:36:56,608
to die. to die.
 doomed to die.

1059
01:36:56,608 --> 01:36:59,695
There is no second place

1060
01:36:59,695 --> 01:37:03,157
SYNAPSE will fully unite
 the global village

1061
01:37:03,157 --> 01:37:06,577
New ideas are ready to be
 devoured, devoured, re-defined

1062
01:37:06,577 --> 01:37:07,911
This business is binary,

1063
01:37:07,911 --> 01:37:11,165
either a one or a zero,
 a zero, a zero,

1064
01:37:11,165 --> 01:37:16,545
alive or dead, alive or dead,
 alive or dead, alive, dead, alive.

1065
01:37:16,545 --> 01:37:18,547
Surrounded by predators.
 Those who don't innovate

1066
01:37:18,547 --> 01:37:21,508
Those who don't innovate

1067
01:37:21,508 --> 01:37:25,304
are doomed to die
 There is no second place

1068
01:37:25,304 --> 01:37:29,433
Consumers don't care where new ideas come from

1069
01:37:29,433 --> 01:37:31,894
just so long as they are offered at a competitive price

1070
01:37:31,894 --> 01:37:34,021
 anywhere in the World
 anywhere in the World

1071
01:37:34,021 --> 01:37:36,690
with a good idea can put us out of business

1072
01:37:36,690 --> 01:37:38,150
Alive or dead

1073
01:37:38,150 --> 01:37:40,444
We do have a monopoly here at NURV.

1074
01:37:40,444 --> 01:37:42,529
There's no second place

1075
01:37:42,529 --> 01:37:45,157
You're a one or a zero, alive or dead

1076
01:37:47,451 --> 01:37:49,453
Are you insane? What do you think you're doing?

1077
01:37:49,453 --> 01:37:51,079
I'm letting people know
 what you've been doing

1078
01:37:51,079 --> 01:37:52,289
Phil, where is this signal coming from?

1079
01:37:52,289 --> 01:37:53,874
I'm working on it, I am working on it.

1080
01:37:53,874 --> 01:37:55,125
Work faster!!

1081
01:37:55,125 --> 01:37:58,128
A good chess player always knows
 his opponents moves before he makes them.

1082
01:37:58,128 --> 01:38:02,341
Isn't that right Gray?
 - You think you know all my moves?
 You arrogant little bastard

1083
01:38:02,341 --> 01:38:04,510
You think they gonna come after me,

1084
01:38:04,510 --> 01:38:05,844
now that SYNAPSE is here !

1085
01:38:05,844 --> 01:38:08,972
This is the technology that'll 
 fuel business for the next 30 years

1086
01:38:08,972 --> 01:38:12,351
You think they gonna allow foreign
 competitors an opening like that?

1087
01:38:12,351 --> 01:38:14,353
Undermined the entire economy

1088
01:38:14,353 --> 01:38:16,772
Over what? A cyber prank?

1089
01:38:16,772 --> 01:38:19,233
Then you don't have anything
 to worry about. Do you?

1090
01:38:23,153 --> 01:38:25,614
The Lawyers at the gate Gary.
 They say the Feds are on their way.

1091
01:38:25,614 --> 01:38:27,366
Oh Jesus.

1092
01:38:27,366 --> 01:38:29,117
It's coming from NURV, it's building 21

1093
01:38:29,117 --> 01:38:30,744
Call security, get someone over there now.

1094
01:38:30,744 --> 01:38:32,162
Break down the door, if yo have to

1095
01:38:32,162 --> 01:38:34,206
but get me that disk. Get it here

1096
01:38:34,206 --> 01:38:36,792
- How did this happen Phil?
- I don't know,

1097
01:38:36,875 --> 01:38:41,338
she called, she said Milo
 had SYNAPSE, he'd left the campus and..

1098
01:38:43,465 --> 01:38:48,262
You lied, for him...
 You're playing with fire

1099
01:38:48,262 --> 01:38:50,848
If you think for second I won't 
 send you back where you came from.

1100
01:38:50,848 --> 01:38:53,225
Hey Gary
 I want you to see this

1101
01:38:59,773 --> 01:39:01,859
Are you still proud of me?

1102
01:39:16,665 --> 01:39:20,627
You guys know where you need to be..
 Go, go, go!!

1103
01:39:20,627 --> 01:39:23,255
Rany, Danny come on lets get out of here
 Come on, Let's go, let's go.

1104
01:39:27,509 --> 01:39:30,012
Rebecca, Rebecca come on, let's go.

1105
01:39:32,556 --> 01:39:36,351
I'm not going with you

1106
01:39:36,351 --> 01:39:40,314
I would rather stay here and
 face the consequences of my own actions,

1107
01:39:40,314 --> 01:39:42,983
than be associate with yours

1108
01:39:47,279 --> 01:39:48,614
This was mine, Milo

1109
01:39:48,614 --> 01:39:51,742
You tell that to the people 
 you stole it from, tell it to Teddy

1110
01:39:51,742 --> 01:39:56,079
Come on, it's only a matter of time
 before someone owns the information

1111
01:39:56,079 --> 01:39:58,207
You can't stop it, you slowed it down

1112
01:39:58,207 --> 01:40:01,210
I slowed you down Gary.
 That's what matter to me

1113
01:40:01,210 --> 01:40:03,003
This isn't a game.

1114
01:40:03,003 --> 01:40:07,424
In the real world, when you kill people,
 they die. For real!

1115
01:40:07,424 --> 01:40:10,052
And in the real world,
 you're Fucked!

1116
01:40:15,432 --> 01:40:17,684
Are you coming?

1117
01:40:26,193 --> 01:40:27,653
Let them go

1118
01:40:28,654 --> 01:40:32,032
Tomorrow, he is
 the most famous geek in the world

1119
01:40:37,412 --> 01:40:39,665
Gary, we need information
 I’ve been betrayed

1120
01:40:39,665 --> 01:40:41,792
Randy and Phil are missing?

1121
01:40:41,792 --> 01:40:45,003
Something's going on! Take this down

1122
01:40:46,922 --> 01:40:49,466
Come to my attention,

1123
01:40:49,466 --> 01:40:53,762
Certain rouge elements of my company
 have been involved in illegal activities

1124
01:40:53,762 --> 01:40:58,058
in an attempt to discredit me and
 risk control of my company.

1125
01:40:58,058 --> 01:41:01,520
I'm most shocked and upset by this betrayal.

1126
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:06,984
I will do everything in my power
 to co-operate with the authorities 
 and  bring these criminals to Justice.

1127
01:41:06,984 --> 01:41:10,988
News that the FBI agent have arrested
 NURV CEO Gray Winston,

1128
01:41:10,988 --> 01:41:14,783
TV's, cell phones and PC's were
 interrupted world wide last night

1129
01:41:14,783 --> 01:41:19,079
by a huge broadcast
 initiated by programmer Milo Hoffmann.

1130
01:41:19,079 --> 01:41:25,335
Police have also arrested these other members of
 Winston’s team at a Portland airfield
 as they attempted to board a private jet.

1131
01:41:25,335 --> 01:41:28,338
Justice officials reacted swiftly..

1132
01:41:28,338 --> 01:41:31,592
Man, Clinton testimony didn't get this many hits

1133
01:41:31,592 --> 01:41:34,052
This is, this is awesome

1134
01:41:34,052 --> 01:41:36,555
I mean there is 400 requests a second, Brain.

1135
01:41:36,555 --> 01:41:41,059
We did this! I'm surprised 
 this isn't blowing the server

1136
01:41:41,059 --> 01:41:43,228
Wow, Whoa get over here

1137
01:41:43,228 --> 01:41:45,022
Come here, Come here

1138
01:41:45,022 --> 01:41:51,236
Already over 18 million people have 
 downloaded the source code for
 SYNAPSE from the Skullbox website.

1139
01:41:51,236 --> 01:41:55,741
Now Skullbox is thought to have originated
 right here in this Palo Alto garage

1140
01:42:07,878 --> 01:42:11,298
- Hi there, I just have a couple of questions for you
 - Is Milo Hoffmann going to testify

1141
01:42:11,298 --> 01:42:12,800
Do you know where he is now?

1142
01:42:13,550 --> 01:42:15,969
How many hits have you guy's registered?

1143
01:42:16,804 --> 01:42:19,473
What's your relationship to Milo Hoffmann?

1144
01:42:21,975 --> 01:42:24,436
- Good luck
- Okay

1145
01:42:27,815 --> 01:42:30,108
Milo

1146
01:42:30,108 --> 01:42:31,735
It wasn't all false

1147
01:42:34,613 --> 01:42:36,698
I Know

1148
01:42:36,698 --> 01:42:37,825
Bye

1149
01:42:42,329 --> 01:42:45,499
Do you consider this an 
 ultraman victory for open source

1150
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:52,840
Excuse me

1151
01:42:58,679 --> 01:42:59,930
We did it partner

1152
01:43:00,347 --> 01:43:01,598
Are you going to testify?

1153
01:43:02,307 --> 01:43:04,309
Winston always said
 that any kid in a garage

1154
01:43:04,309 --> 01:43:07,271
could put him out of business,
 is that what you've done Milo?

1155
01:43:07,271 --> 01:43:08,856
This is a garage

1156
01:43:08,856 --> 01:43:10,357
Hey, there he is.

1157
01:43:10,774 --> 01:43:12,985
Just now getting word that,

1158
01:43:12,985 --> 01:43:16,488
yes, yes here he is,
 here is Gary Winston

1159
01:43:16,488 --> 01:43:20,367
being led by US marshals
 to the federal court in Portland....

1160
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:29,042
Milo, when did you first realize
 Gary Winston's stealing code

1161
01:43:29,042 --> 01:43:31,837
What is it exactly that you think
 you have done Milo?

1162
01:43:31,837 --> 01:43:33,005
And what does it all mean?

1163
01:43:33,005 --> 01:43:36,675
It means we've given SYNAPSE back 
 to the people it was stolen from.

1164
01:43:36,675 --> 01:43:38,719
Human knowledge belongs to the world

1165
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:41,472
Can we get a picture of the Skullbox team?
