00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,640
Welcome to New Tokyo
International Airport. Welcome.

2
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,560
- Welcome to Tokyo.
- Thank you very much.

3
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,920
My name is Kawasaki. Nice to meet you.
I've heard of you. Thank you.

4
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,200
For you.
Thank you.

5
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,120
- And Mr. Mori from Suntory.
- Hi.

6
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,640
And Miss Shibata.
Hey, I need that.

7
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,600
And Mr. Awinami.
Nice to meet you.

8
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,040
All right.
Thank you.

9
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,400
And Mr. Tanaka.
Thank you.
Thank you.

10
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,720
And we will pick you up
in the morning?

11
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,640
Okay.
See you tomorrow.

12
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,480
Great. Short and sweet.
Very Japanese. I like that.

13
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,200
- My pleasure.
- Yeah, get some sleep, will ya?

14
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,240
We're all... You're all really tired,
I'm sure. See you tomorrow.

15
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,120
Good night. Thank you.

16
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,040
Thank you...
What's this?

17
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,240
Something good?

18
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,120
Thank you.

19
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,160
Mr. Harris, welcome to Park Hyatt Tokyo.
Yeah.

20
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,120
This way, please.

21
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,200
Mr. Harris,
pleased to welcome.

22
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,120
Thank you.
Have a nice stay with us.

23
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,120
This way.

24
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,960
Mr. Harris,
welcome to Park Hyatt Tokyo.

25
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,880
Thank you.
Enjoy your stay with us.

26
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,880
Thank you very much.

27
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,280
I'm in your arms

28
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,800
And you are kissing me

29
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,400
But there seems to be

30
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,840
Finish this drink, then
we'll go to a jazz club. Yeah.

31
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,160
You see that guy?
Yeah.

32
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,560
You know who that is?
It's not him.

33
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,960
It looks like him,
but it's not him.

34
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,840
Can you believe it?
Okay, maybe it is.

35
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,720
He's here with us. I'm gonna go talk to him.
Shut up. Shut up.

36
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,600
Bob? Bob Harris?
You're awesome, man!

37
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,520
Sunset Odds.
Loved it.

38
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,920
Man, that car chase...
I couldn't believe it.

39
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,800
Four buses... And he took that thing
and everything exploded.

40
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,560
I heard he did his own driving.
Did you do your own driving?

41
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,480
I did.
Cool.

42
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,360
So, what are you doing here?
Yeah.

43
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,280
Um, seeing friends.
Seeing friends.

44
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,200
Yeah? Great.

45
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,120
We're here on business.

46
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,040
I can see it in your eyes
Later.

47
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,040
See you, Bob.
Keep it up.

48
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,400
Are you awake?

49
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,840
John.

50
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,080
Go to sleep.

51
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,160
Aah.

52
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,000
Moshi moshi.

53
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,880
All ri...
Yeah, I'm coming down.

54
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,800
Okay.

55
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,080
I gotta go to work.
Okay.

56
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,960
I love you. I'll see you later.
Okay. Bye.

57
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,240
Mr. Bob-san.

58
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,440
Suntory whiskey.

59
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,960
Casablanca. Bogie.

60
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,920
Suntory time.

61
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,560
Um, he want you to turn,
look in camera.

62
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,120
Okay?

63
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,440
That's all he said?
Yes.

64
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,400
Turn to camera.

65
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,840
All right, does he want me
to... to... turn from the right,

66
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,160
or... turn from the left?

67
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,760
Passionate. Camera. Passion.

68
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,800
Right side,
and, uh, with intensity.

69
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,760
Okay?

70
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,720
Is that everything? I mean, it seemed
like he said quite a bit more than that.

71
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,560
Whiskey.

72
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,560
Gently.

73
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,560
Tension.

74
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,200
Like an old friend,
and into the camera.

75
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,200
Okay.

76
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,520
Whiskey.

77
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,360
It's Suntory time! Okay?

78
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,720
- Okay.
- Okay?

79
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,360
- Hey, come on!
Come on, come on, come on.

80
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,480
For relaxing times,

81
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,400
make it Suntory time.

82
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,040
Cut-o!
Cut-o, cut-o, cut-o, cut-o, cut-o!

83
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,560
Uh, could you do it slower...

84
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,200
and with more... intensity?

85
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,080
Suntory time.

86
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,720
For relaxing times,

87
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,600
make it Suntory time.

88
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,800
Cut-o, cut-o, cut-o, cut-o!

89
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,360
Hello?

90
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,280
Lauren?

91
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,200
Charlotte! Hey!

92
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,120
Hey.
Oh, my God. How's Tokyo?

93
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,600
It's great here.
It's really great.

94
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,200
Um, I don't know...
I went to this shrine today.

95
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,440
And, um,

96
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,320
there were these monks
and they were chanting.

97
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,200
And I didn't feel anything.
You know?

98
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,720
And, um, I don't know...

99
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,240
I even tried ikebana,
and John is using these hair products.

100
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,720
I just... I don't know who I married.
Look, can you wait a second?

101
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,200
Just hold on. I'll be right back.
Okay, sure.

102
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,000
Sorry.
What were you saying?

103
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,400
Nothing. It's okay.
I'll call you later. Okay?

104
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,280
Okay. Have the best time.
Just call me when you get back.

105
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,280
Bye.
Love you. bBye.

106
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,880
God!

107
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,880
At the fitting today,
they had all these...

108
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,800
rock and roll clothes,

109
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,200
but the band
wasn't tough at all.

110
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,080
The label guy just kept saying,
"More lock and loll,"

111
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,440
but it's just so much better if they're just
skinny and nerdy like they came in, you know.

112
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,880
They're making them wear all these
Keith Richards clothes, and it's just ridiculous.

113
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,760
They should let them be who they are.
Don't you think?

114
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,680
Yeah.

115
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,600
Yeah, that's exactly
what I was saying.

116
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,120
But then you try to...
I mean, you know...

117
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,080
That's what I think.

118
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,040
Do you think this is done?

119
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,000
I don't know. I don't know.

120
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,640
Would you... Would you
please stop smoking?

121
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,960
I like to.
I don't really smoke that much.

122
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,240
It's just so bad for you,
though.

123
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,240
Well, I'll stop later.

124
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,040
Welcome back, Mr. Harris.
Yes, Mr. Harris.

125
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,400
Please. Thank you.

126
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,360
Mr. Harris?
Yes?

127
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,280
Mr. Kazu sent me.
Oh?

128
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,280
May I enter?

129
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,480
Thank you.

130
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,720
Do you like massage?

131
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,480
I don't think
I... I like massage anymore.

132
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,280
Mr. Kazu sends
premium fantasy.

133
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,880
My stockings... "lip" them.

134
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,120
"Lip" my stockings.

135
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,120
Yes, please.

136
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,160
"Lip" them.

137
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,080
What?

138
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,080
"Lip" them.

139
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,480
Hey! "Lip" my stocking!

140
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,520
Hey! "Lip" them?
"Lip" them? What?

141
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,200
"Lip" them. Like this.
"Lip" them.

142
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,120
Rip them?
"Lip," yes.

143
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,000
You want me
to rip your stockings?
Yes, "lip" my stockings, please.

144
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,360
Rip your stockings. You want me to rip
your stockings. Yes. Please? Please? Please?

145
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,240
All right, I'm gonna rip your stockings,
and you tell Mr. Kazu we had a blast.

146
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,760
Oh, no! Mr. Harris!
Oh, my God!

147
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,680
Don't touch me!

148
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,880
Mr. Bob Harris,
don't touch me!

149
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,800
Just "lip" my stocking!

150
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,560
Oh, no, Mr. Harris!

151
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,120
Oh, no! Help! Help!
Yeah... Yeah.

152
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,040
Help, please! Help, please!
Okay.

153
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,440
Mr. Harris, help, please.
Careful with those.

154
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,120
Oh! Help, please! Help, please!
Come on. Come on.

155
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,800
Let me go, Mr. Harris!

156
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,040
Oh, no! Let me go!
Come on. Come on.

157
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,640
Ohh! Let me go! Let me go.
Oh, crap.

158
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,280
Please let me go.
With pleasure.

159
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,080
Oh, no, Mr. Bob Harris,
don't let me go! No!

160
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,920
No! Oh, no,
Mr. Bob Harris!

161
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,360
Ohh! Oh, please.

162
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,320
Let me go, please!

163
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,120
Mr. Harris! Good morning.

164
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,680
Hi.

165
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,520
We just got a request from Tanabe Mori.
He is the Johnny Carson of Japan.

166
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,200
It is a big honor
to be invited to his show.

167
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,000
Can you stay here
until Friday?

168
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,760
Uh, I'm surprised and honored, but I think
I need to check with my agent.

169
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,640
Okay, I believe I may have
a previous commitment.

170
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,560
Sure.
I understand.

171
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,520
Shall we go?
Yes.

172
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,240
I think you should do it.
No, hear this, Fred.

173
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,960
I gotta be on a plane
Thursday night.

174
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,880
We're looking into it, Bob.

175
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,760
They really want you to stay
and do that talk show.

176
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,680
Apparently,
he's a really big deal...

177
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,360
Johnny Carson of Japan.
Yeah.

178
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,720
Bob, these people
are paying you a lot.
Would you please consider it?

179
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,600
I already have.
I-I gotta get out of here.

180
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,520
As soon as I can.

181
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,360
All right, you're scheduled to leave Friday,
but we'll hold it for you Saturday.

182
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,880
You're breaking up, Fred.
There's no reception in this studio.

183
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,880
Forget it.
Call me back.

184
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,480
So, can you put your hand
close your face, please?

185
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,160
I'm sorry, Naka. What?

186
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,680
Can you put your hand
close your face?

187
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,240
I don't get that close to the glass
until I'm on the floor.

188
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,160
How's this?

189
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,560
Yes.
You want a whiskey?

190
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,520
This is not whiskey. This is iced tea.
If you gave me real whiskey...

191
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,480
I need mysterious face.

192
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,720
Can you show mysterious?
Mysterious.

193
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,440
I think I know what you want.
You want this, right?

194
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,680
I need more mysterious and, uh...

195
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,080
More mysterious. Yeah. I'll just try to think,
"Where the hell's the whiskey?"

196
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,520
You are a movie star, yes?

197
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,360
Yes, I should be doing movies, yes, but...
And "Lat Pack. "

198
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,920
"Lat Pack. "
You know "Lat Pack"?

199
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,840
Rat P... Rat Pack?

200
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,160
Rat Pack. Yes, please.
Oh, right, right.

201
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,000
I need more tension, please.

202
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,000
More t...

203
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,280
You so gentleman, yes?

204
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,280
A-ring-a-ding-ding.
Yeah.

205
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,480
"Sinatora. "
You know "Sinatora"?

206
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,760
Old Blue Eyes.
Yeah.

207
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,640
That's good.
Yeah.

208
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,160
That's more of Dino. That's Dino.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

209
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,080
Great.

210
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,680
Joey Bishop would you like?
Yes. Just change film.

211
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,800
Are you drinking?
No?

212
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,720
Am I drinking?
As soon as I'm done.

213
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,960
Okay, close your hand,
please.

214
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,880
Close your hand.
Yeah... Close it?

215
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,800
Yes.
Close your face, please.

216
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,960
Close my...
Yes. Sorry.

217
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,960
And, uh, 007?

218
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,120
He drinks martinis, but okay, I got it.
007, yeah.

219
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,680
"Loger" Moore?

220
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,480
"Loger"Moore?
"Loger" Moore.

221
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,840
You know "Loger" Moore?
Roger Moore?

222
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,280
Yeah.
Okay. I... I...

223
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,560
- I always think of Sean Connery. Seriously.
- No, no.

224
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,000
Didn't you get the Sean Connery one over here?
No. "Loger" Moore.

225
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,960
Yes.

226
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,000
"Loger" Moore?
No...

227
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,280
Yeah. Okay.

228
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,920
Yeah, okay. Good.

229
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,920
More. Please.

230
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,640
You mean "more," or "Roger Moore"again?
Yeah. Yeah.

231
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,520
Good.

232
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,520
And sexy!

233
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,640
Are you going

234
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,960
To Scarborough Fair

235
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,080
Parsley, sage

236
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,960
Rosemary

237
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,240
And thyme

238
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,280
He's really sad.

239
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,280
Thank you.
We're glad to be here.

240
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,280
We're Sausalito.

241
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,920
They're beautiful. They're beautiful, yeah.
You know?

242
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,360
Send these over
to that table over there.

243
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,280
Old temple?
An old temple?

244
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,200
Yeah.
Oh, beautiful, man.

245
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,560
Excuse me, sir.
From the woman over there.

246
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,840
Oh! Oh, th-they are?
Really?

247
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,760
Yeah, yeah.
Wh-What's... What's...

248
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,120
Is Japan...
Is it mainly Buddhism here?

249
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,240
Yeah, it's Buddhism.

250
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,160
CD or...

251
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,080
Yeah, CD.
Playing her...

252
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,120
Oh, she plays... guitar?
Guitar. Guitar.

253
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,480
That's a beautiful job.

254
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,200
Help!

255
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,440
Good morning.
Good morning.

256
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,360
Good morning.
Good morning.

257
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,360
Are you okay?
Yeah. Fine.

258
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,600
Car is outside.
Shall we go?

259
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,200
That's what I told him.

260
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,520
He never listens.
Yeah.

261
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,240
John?

262
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,520
Oh, my God! John!
What are you doing here?

263
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,480
Uh, oh, w-well, you know, uh, w...
I'm just here, uh, shooting a band.

264
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,040
What about you?
I'm here promoting that action movie I did.

265
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,680
Hyah! You know!
I'm doing 20 million interviews a day.

266
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,600
It's crazy.

267
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,840
God, it is so good to see you!
Yeah. Yeah.

268
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,280
So, how long are you gonna be here?
We're here for a week.

269
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,200
I'm gonna go shoot
in Fukawaka.

270
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,120
Oh, it's amazing!

271
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,040
Yeah. Oh. Oh, yeah.
It's amazing.

272
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,120
You know... Oh, this is...
this is my wife, Charlotte.

273
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,960
Hi! It's really nice to meet you!
Hi. Nice to meet you.

274
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,040
Hello!
Yeah!

275
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
Wife?
Yeah. Yeah.

276
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,440
John. John.

277
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,360
You are
my favorite photographer.

278
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,360
Oh, come on!
No, you are. I only want you to shoot me.

279
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,200
It's true!

280
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,680
I have the worst B.O. Right now.
I'm so sorry.

281
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,280
No, no, no.
But, listen, um...

282
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,040
- Let's all go out for a drink sometime.
- Yeah.

283
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,920
You know? Call me. Okay?
Yeah. Okay.

284
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,840
Listen,
I'm under Evelyn Waugh.

285
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,760
Shh. Okay?

286
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,360
Okay. Yeah.

287
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,280
Okay, arigato, arigato.

288
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,760
Moshi moshi!

289
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,680
Evelyn Waugh?

290
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,920
What?
Evelyn Waugh was a man.

291
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,920
Oh, come on.
She's nice.

292
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,240
What? You know...
You know, not everybody went to Yale.

293
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,720
It was just a pseudonym,
for Christ's sake.

294
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,680
Why do you
have to defend her?

295
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,040
Well, why do you have to point out
how stupid everybody is all the time?

296
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,200
I thought it was funny.
Forget it.

297
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,120
Well...

298
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,480
Hey, John, we gotta go.
Oh. Yeah.

299
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,480
Bye.

300
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,800
Did you ever wonder
what your purpose in life is?

301
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,320
This book is about finding
your soul's purpose or destiny.

302
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,040
Every soul has its path,
but sometimes that path is not clear.

303
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,640
The Inner Map Theory is an example
of how each soul begins with an imprint,

304
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,040
all compacted into a pattern
that has been selected by your soul...

305
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,360
before you've even gotten here.

306
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,200
You know, I guess the reason
why I like Japan the best...

307
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,120
out of all Asian countries...

308
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,760
is because I really feel
close to, um, Buddhism.

309
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,000
I really feel...
I really believe in reincarnation.

310
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,880
That's part of what drew me
to Midnight Velocity as well,

311
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,360
because although Keanu dies,

312
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,280
he eventually
gets reincarnated.

313
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,800
So there's hope...
There's hope in reincarnation, I think.

314
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,720
What was it like working
with Keanu Reeves?

315
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,080
He was always so...
He was always, you know, giving me ideas...

316
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,000
and, you know, really helpful.

317
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,920
He made me feel
really comfortable, so...

318
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,600
And we both have two dogs,
and we both live in L.A.,

319
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,720
so we have all these
different things in common.

320
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,600
So, you know, we both
really like Mexican food...

321
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,800
and yoga and...

322
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,720
karate!

323
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,600
Mexican food. Yoga.

324
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,840
Konnichi wa.
Hello. Hi.

325
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,560
okay.

326
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,840
Okay.

327
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,960
Okay.

328
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,360
Hai. Okay. Hai. Hai.
Okay.

329
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,040
He got married
a couple of times...

330
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,960
To some nice women.

331
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,320
Beautiful women too. I mean, you and I
would be crazy for these women.

332
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,720
But there were
always rumors.

333
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,640
I never liked his acting,

334
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,520
so I never gave a damn
whether he was straight or not.

335
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,400
Thank you... Hi.
Thanks.

336
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,320
What can I get you?

337
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,920
Um, I'm not sure.

338
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,760
For relaxing times,
make it...

339
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,760
Suntory time.

340
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,040
Um, I'll have a vodka tonic.

341
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,000
Thanks.

342
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,040
So, what are you
doing here?

343
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,440
Uh, a couple of things.

344
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,040
Taking a break from my wife,
forgetting my son's birthday,

345
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,360
and, uh, getting paid
$2 million...

346
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,880
to endorse a whiskey...

347
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,840
when I could be doing
a play somewhere.

348
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,200
Oh.

349
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,600
But the good news is,
the whiskey works.

350
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,080
What are you doing?

351
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,600
Um, my husband's
a photographer,

352
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,520
so he's here working and, uh,

353
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,920
I wasn't doing anything,
so I came along.

354
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,760
And we have some friends that live here.
How long have you been married?

355
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,680
Oh, thank you.

356
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,480
Two years.

357
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,400
Twenty-five long ones.

358
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,600
You're probably just
having a midlife crisis.

359
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,560
Did you buy a Porsche yet?

360
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,520
You know, I was thinking
about buying a Porsche.

361
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,040
Twenty-five years.

362
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,920
That's a...
Well, it's impressive.

363
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,560
Well, you figure you sleep
one-third of your life.

364
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,280
That knocks off eight years
of marriage right there.

365
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,200
So you're down
to 16 and change.

366
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,120
You're just a teenager
at marriage.

367
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,400
You can drive it, but there's
still the occasional accident.

368
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,960
Yeah.

369
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,960
What do you do?

370
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,800
I'm not sure yet,
actually.

371
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,520
I just graduated
last spring.

372
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,360
What did you study?

373
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,280
Philosophy.

374
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,720
Yeah, there's a good buck in that racket.
Yeah.

375
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,200
Well, so far
it's pro bono.

376
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,240
Well, I'm sure you'll figure out the angles.
Yeah.

377
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,520
I hope your Porsche works out.

378
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,280
Cheers to that, huh?
Cheers to that.

379
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,280
Kanpai.

380
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,320
Wish I could sleep.

381
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,320
Me too.

382
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,840
One, two, three,
and okay.

383
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,720
All right.

384
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,280
One, two, three, four.

385
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,760
And one, two, three, four.

386
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,680
And one, two...

387
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,080
Wait! Take me with you!

388
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,400
How'd it go, huh?

389
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,600
Oh, it was good, you know.
I'm tired.

390
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,480
Yeah, I-I-I gotta go downstairs
and meet Kelly for some drinks.

391
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,800
She wants to talk about some photo thing.
Maybe I'll go downstairs with you.

392
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,720
Oh, you wanna come?

393
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,600
Yeah, sure.

394
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,720
Okay. Yeah.

395
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,840
You

396
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,760
Stepped out
of a dream

397
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,280
Everybody is always, like,
"Kelly, you are anorexic. "

398
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,120
And I'm, like, "No, I'm not. "I eat
so much junk food, you wouldn't believe it.

399
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,040
Just because I have
a high metabolism.

400
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,960
Because I thought
you were anorexic too.

401
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,520
Everybody does. Everybody thinks that.
Yeah, 'cause you look so...

402
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,440
Thank you!
I know, but it's...

403
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,760
I mean, I eat whatever.
I have a really high metabolism.

404
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,680
Yeah.
But, um...

405
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,440
My dad
was an anorexic.

406
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,960
Really?
Oh, really?

407
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,920
Yeah.

408
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,760
He, um, fought on the American side
of the Bay of Pigs in Cuba.

409
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,920
He was taken prisoner, and the whole time
he was there they tortured him about food.

410
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,960
Every day they told him
they put poison in the food.

411
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,640
So they would always make themselves
throw up after every meal.

412
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,520
That's horrible.
That's terrible.

413
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,560
That's some crazy shit.

414
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,600
You don't think he sounds kinda goofy?
No!

415
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,200
You know that break beat, right?
Well, I been takin' it to some next level shit.

416
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,080
Like, I'll take that and put
a delay on it, so it's like...

417
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,000
So it's, like, evolving,
the beat.

418
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,800
So it, like, sounds hella large
on the track. You know what I'm sayin'?

419
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,720
No.
No?

420
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,600
You don't listen to hip-hop?

421
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,000
Oh, my God!
You guys gotta listen.

422
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,840
I tried this power cleanse.
It's so amazing.

423
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,640
Okay, promise me you'll try it.
Will you try this power cleanse?

424
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,040
I did it last week, and it's amazing.
I'll be right back.

425
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,360
It's so good to get
the toxins out of your body.

426
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,720
With all, like, the pollution,
all, like, the...

427
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,920
Hello.
Hello.

428
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,920
You ever switch seats?

429
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,200
Uh, I like this one.
If I fall, someone will notice.

430
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,120
Yeah.

431
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,280
So, you having a nice time?

432
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,240
Can you keep a secret?

433
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,840
I'm trying to organize
a prison break.

434
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,760
I'm looking for, like,
an accomplice.

435
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,080
We'd have to, first,
get out of this bar.

436
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,920
Then the hotel, then the city,
and then the country.

437
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,800
Are you in, or are you out?
I'm in.

438
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,720
Good.
I'll go pack my stuff.

439
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,480
Get your coat.
See ya.

440
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,680
I hope you've had enough to drink.
It's gonna take courage.

441
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,400
Oh, look.
The label got me these.

442
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,480
Mmm, I love Cristal.
You wanna have some?

443
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:10,240
Well, I'm...
I gotta go. I mean, I...

444
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,400
Y-You know,
you don't have to stay.

445
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,040
I mean...
You don't have to go, do you?

446
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,000
Well, I...

447
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,400
I know. You're gonna be
working the whole time.

448
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,680
I'll have a much better time here. I'll call
Charlie and those guys. - Yeah! Call those guys.

449
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,040
And I'm gonna be back
on Sunday, and I...

450
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,000
I love you, you know.

451
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,640
Okay?
I love you.

452
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,680
I'll see you. Okay? Yeah, it's just gonna be
a couple of... a couple of days.

453
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,600
Bye.

454
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,600
I love you.

455
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,760
Hello.

456
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,320
Hello.
How are you?

457
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,560
Good. How are you?

458
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,840
It's a cool pool, isn't it?
Yeah, it's nice.

459
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,840
Get any sleep?

460
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,440
Not yet.
How about you?

461
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,360
No. Not yet.

462
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,840
How long you staying for?

463
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,920
I'll be in the bar
for the rest of the week.

464
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,800
Well, that's good.

465
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,560
Um, I'm going out with some friends later,
if you wanna come.

466
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,160
Sure.
Okay. I'll see you later.

467
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,120
Okay.
See ya.

468
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,520
Oop...

469
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,600
"Bob, which one do you want
for your study?

470
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,560
I like the burgundy,
but whatever you want. "

471
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,000
Which one is burgundy?

472
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,160
Hold on!

473
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,120
Hold on.

474
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:10,840
You really are
having a midlife crisis, huh?

475
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,720
Really?
Yeah, I was afraid of that.

476
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:18,480
I kept telling myself that I just wanted
to be ready in case we go to war tonight.

477
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,280
My bathroom
is messier than yours.

478
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,840
And it's not like
you're not tryin'.

479
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,760
Here, will you cut the tag out for me?
Sure.

480
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,640
You're too tall.

481
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,040
Uh, anybody ever tell you
you may be too small?

482
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,920
Whose is this? "A Soul's Search:
Finding Your True Calling. "

483
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,440
I don't know.

484
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,920
I have that.
Did it work out
for you, then?

485
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,400
Obviously.

486
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,320
Okay.
Okay.

487
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,400
Where's your shoes?
They're over here.

488
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,760
- Where's your room key?
- It's in my bag.

489
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,640
- And where's your bag?
- It's right here.

490
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,560
Let's go.
Wait!

491
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,760
There's the elevator.
I gotta go.

492
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,800
Hi! How are you?
Hi, Charlie!

493
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,680
Um, Bob,
this is Charlie Brown.

494
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,880
Hi. Nice to meet you.
How are you? Nice to meet you.

495
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,520
- This is Bambi.
- How are you, Bambi?

496
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,840
His real name's Hayashi, but...
Why do they call you Charlie Brown?

497
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,320
Everybody say, "He looks like Charlie Brown."
You know, Snoopy, man.

498
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,600
Oh, I'll be right back.

499
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,920
Bob, over here. These are my friends.
Very beautiful.

500
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,760
She's "B," and she's Rico,
and she's Myumi.

501
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,040
- Myumi. How are you? I'm Bob.
- Oh! Bob.

502
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,000
Bob from
United States, man.

503
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,840
Ahh!
Hi, Bob.

504
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,240
Maybe you'd like to
sing backup for me.

505
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,480
This is my surfing teacher.
- He's your surfing teacher?

506
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,640
Sometime, sometime.
You're a surfer?

507
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,680
Oh, oui, oui.
The emperor's house? Cool.

508
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,800
Yeah?
Yeah.

509
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,720
Oui.

510
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:47,040
Cool!
Right.

511
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,440
You don't have anything...
Do you have anything b...

512
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,160
Hey.
Hey. How you doin'?

513
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,560
- Good. How are you?
- My Japanese is getting better.

514
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,480
We started speaking English.

515
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,360
Charlie.

516
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,880
Ooh! Get out, guys!

517
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,240
- I'm leaving!
They'll sting!

518
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,520
Whoo!

519
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,440
Who are these guys, anyway?

520
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,800
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey!

521
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,760
Oh, no.

522
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,880
Hi.

523
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,960
Come on!

524
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,880
Hey, guys! Over here!

525
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,800
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Hurry up!

526
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,320
Wait!
Our tour guide!

527
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,280
Hurry up!

528
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,920
Yeah?
Gorgeous.

529
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,760
Gorgeous?
Blonde and black.

530
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,400
Well, it's a feelin'I get

531
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,280
- Cheese. Cheese-o!
- Cheese!

532
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,720
Yeah, yeah... Hi.
It's a feelin'I get

533
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,160
Hi, I'm Hans.
Nice to meet you.

534
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,640
I'm Charlotte.
Nice to meet you.

535
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,560
Hi.
Hi.

536
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,000
Last weekend, I went surfing.
Right.

537
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:46,480
About seven people, you know.
Some friends.

538
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,480
And we camp over there
on the beach.

539
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,600
In fact, we made a kind of...

540
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,320
Wait. What kind of weed is it?
I don't know.

541
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,800
Baby, when I saw you turnin'
at the end of the street

542
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,040
I knew our time was gone

543
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,920
Into blank pages

544
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,920
Just understand I was afraid
to be a simple guy

545
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,400
I tried my best to smile

546
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,160
But deep inside my heart

547
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,360
I felt like the shell
that a crab comes in

548
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,080
I guess I couldn't
live without things

549
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,840
A fascist regime

550
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,720
It made you a moron

551
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,960
A potential H-bomb

552
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,720
God save the queen

553
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,840
She ain't no human being

554
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,080
There's no future

555
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,640
In England's dreaming

556
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:55,200
As I walk through

557
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,880
This wicked world

558
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,240
Searchin' for light
in the darkness

559
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,240
Of insanity

560
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,280
I ask myself

561
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,640
Is all hope lost

562
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,200
Is there only pain

563
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,640
And hatred

564
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,680
And misery

565
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,720
And each time
I feel like this inside

566
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,200
There's one thing
I want to know

567
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:30,960
What's so funny 'bout
peace, love and understanding

568
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:39,240
What's so funny 'bout
peace, love and understanding

569
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,800
I'm winkin' at ya

570
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:47,040
Gonna make you, make you
make you notice

571
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,720
Gonna use my arms

572
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,240
Gonna use my legs

573
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,600
Gonna use my style

574
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,880
Gonna use my sidestep

575
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,080
Gonna use my fingers

576
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,840
Gonna use my, my, my
My, my, my

577
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,360
Imagination

578
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,320
'Cause I'm

579
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,480
Gonna make you see

580
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:13,000
Nobody else here
No one like me

581
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,200
— I'm special
- Special

582
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,360
So special
Special?

583
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,920
I gotta have some of your

584
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,800
Attention
Give it to me

585
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,480
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Bob Harris.

586
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,920
Thanks. This is hard.

587
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,920
Oh, Jesus.

588
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:42,640
I could feel at the time

589
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,080
There was no way of knowing

590
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,800
Fallen leaves in the night

591
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,680
Who can say
where they're blowin'

592
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,440
As free as the wind

593
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,400
Hopefully learnin'

594
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:04,600
Why the sea on the tide

595
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,920
Has no way of turnin'

596
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,320
More than this

597
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:18,720
You know there's nothing

598
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,680
More than this

599
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:25,360
Tell me one thing

600
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:29,080
More than this

601
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:33,640
Ooh, there's nothing

602
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,360
Close my eyes

603
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:34,880
Feel me now

604
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,960
I don't know

605
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,600
How you could
not love me now

606
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,400
You will know

607
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,840
With her feet down to the ground

608
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,160
Over there

609
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,240
And I want you, love, to know

610
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:59,200
You can't hide

611
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,600
Oh, no

612
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,720
From the way I feel

613
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:08,080
Hello.
Hey.

614
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,040
Hello, Bob.

615
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,960
Hey, you know, those carpet samples...
you were right about the burgundy.

616
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,000
It wasn't even close.

617
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:19,000
Blows the others away.
I'm glad you like it.

618
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:25,040
I saw a great house tonight
that you would've loved, and...

619
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,400
that burgundy would've been good
in this house, really. - Really?

620
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,640
A guy designed his own house
and built it.

621
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,560
Oh, yeah? I wish I'd seen it.

622
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:39,520
He's a fashion guy.
All these fashion people were there.

623
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:42,360
And, uh, there were
Japanese surfers there,

624
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:47,160
and the guy was playing
really, really, really great music.

625
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,320
I should've found out what it was
and brought some...

626
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,240
I'll bring some back.
I'll try to find out.

627
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,000
That sounds great.
Can you hold on?

628
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,760
You have to have something
for breakfast.

629
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,040
Do you want some cereal?
Tell her I said she's gotta eat something.

630
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,120
I'm just trying to get her
to eat something.

631
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,760
Yeah. Tell her I said
she has to eat something.

632
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,360
Your dad says eat something.
No.

633
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:14,400
Eat. Tell her I said so.
She won't eat anything. Forget it.

634
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,320
Look, I'm glad you're having fun.

635
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,520
It's not fun. It's just...
It's just very, very different.

636
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,640
Maybe that's good.

637
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,240
Um, I have to get
the kids off for school, okay?

638
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,160
So, can I call you in a while?

639
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,600
I might not be up.
It's-It's, like, 4:00.

640
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,800
Well, you better get some sleep.
You have work in the morning.

641
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,760
No, actually,
they gave me tomorrow off.

642
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,480
That must be nice.

643
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,640
All right. Well, thanks
for checking in. I gotta go.

644
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,160
All right. Have a great, great night.
All right.

645
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,240
I mean, I guess have a great morning, huh?

646
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,240
Good night, Bob.
Good night.

647
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,280
I love you.

648
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,120
That was a stupid idea.

649
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,120
I was feeling tight,
you know?

650
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,080
Shoulders and neck.

651
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,720
So I called down
and, and had a, uh,

652
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,440
shiatsu massage in my room.
Mmm, that's nice.

653
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:26,040
And the tightness has
completely, uh, disappeared...

654
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,440
And been replaced by...

655
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,360
unbelievable pain.

656
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,560
Just staggering, unbearable pain.
Ooh, that's too bad.

657
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,480
Yeah.
I'm in pain.

658
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:40,840
I got my foot banged up, and...
Wanna see it?

659
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,320
How do you say no?

660
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,640
Oh, my gosh.
I know.

661
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,120
That's... How...
When did you do this?

662
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,440
I did it the other day.
It hurts, you know?

663
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,560
Didn't you feel any pain? Your...
Yeah, it really hurt.

664
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,840
It was...
Yeah. That toe is almost dead.

665
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:00,360
I gotta take you to a doctor. You can't
just put that back in the shoe.

666
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,280
No. I don't think so.

667
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,520
Well, you either go to a doctor,
or you leave it here.

668
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:09,400
He's smiling.
You like that idea?

669
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,320
See, they love black toe
over in this country.

670
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,720
You got a sharp knife?

671
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:17,560
Gotta be, you know, in this country...
somebody's gotta prefer a black toe.

672
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,160
Uh, "brack" toe.

673
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:23,040
Or we should probably hang around
until someone orders it.

674
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,120
Hey, what's with the straight face?

675
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,280
Hospital regulations.
Get in there.

676
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,200
All right. Thank you.
All right.

677
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:35,240
Careful, okay?
No, don't!

678
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:38,200
No!
Hey, use the horn, fella.

679
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,080
Let's try "mixed internal. "

680
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,480
Yeah. Switched to beer, huh?
Go.

681
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,440
Go. Go.
You might want to switch to sake.

682
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,360
Stop.

683
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,640
Hi.

684
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,560
Hi.
Hi.

685
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,960
Yeah. We need a doctor.
Hai.

686
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,160
For, uh, her...
emergency room.

687
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,320
It's not an emergency.
I just hurt my foot.

688
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,520
Okay, do we fill this out?
We go over there?

689
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,440
Which number?

690
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:24,200
We're not going to another hospital,
so whatever you say is okay.

691
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,120
Okay.

692
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,480
Could you put that back
in the garage for us?

693
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:00,760
Irun desuka.

694
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:05,560
"In desuka"?
Irun desuka.

695
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,520
Nihon ni.

696
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,480
Japan.

697
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:18,160
Japan.
"Appuh. "

698
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,120
Japan "appuh. "
Japan...

699
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,720
"Appuh. " "Appuh. "
After?

700
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:25,080
Japan...
"Appuh. " Nannen.

701
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,440
"Nannen. "

702
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:38,400
Ahh-ah, so.

703
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,040
How's that song go?

704
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,680
Is that for me?

705
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,600
Yeah, it can be for you.

706
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,120
Hey, Bob, it's Charlotte.

707
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:44,120
Um, I'm going to meet Charlie and those guys
at this place called Orange around 10:00,

708
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,800
so I'll fax you a map
on how to get there.

709
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:50,040
I hope you can come
and meet us. Bye.

710
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,480
Suckin'on my titties
like you wanted me

711
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,000
Callin'me all the time
like Blondie

712
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:05,760
Check out my Chrissie be-Hynde
It's fine all of the time

713
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,680
Like sex on the beach is

714
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,280
What else is in the Teaches of Peaches

715
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,360
Huh, what

716
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:21,520
Suckin'on my titties
like you wanted me

717
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:24,200
Callin'me all the time like Blondie

718
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:28,400
How long have you been here?
I couldn't say.

719
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,520
Where's Charlie and those guys?

720
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:34,360
Um, they're takin' a dance class.

721
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,800
Why, what

722
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,360
What, right

723
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,560
Can I get you a couple drinks?
Let's go.

724
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,600
Okay.
Okay.

725
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,720
Like you wanted me
Callin'me all the time like Blondie
Thank you.

726
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:03,080
He's got blockers.

727
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,200
They've got room to run.

728
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,800
He's cutting back.
He cut back.

729
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,720
He's dancin'. He's dancin'.
Where'd he go?

730
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,800
There you are.

731
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,040
Say "Hi. "

732
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,880
Hi. You ready?

733
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,440
Come on.

734
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:32,200
Thank you, Tokyo!

735
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:36,920
Nobody does it better

736
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:43,440
Makes me feel sad for the rest

737
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,920
Nobody does it

738
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:51,680
Half as good as you

739
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:55,360
Baby, you're

740
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,000
The best
You two.

741
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,320
Both of you.

742
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,680
I wasn't lookin'

743
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:07,120
But somehow you found me

744
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:12,560
I tried to hide
from your love, yeah

745
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,080
No, no. Not here.

746
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,920
It must be over there.

747
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:03,520
You know, the first time I saw you,
you were wearing a tuxedo at the bar.

748
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,840
You were very dashing.

749
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,840
I liked the mascara.

750
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:15,840
But the first time I saw you
was in the elevator.

751
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:18,480
Really?
You don't remember?

752
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:25,360
I guess you do kind of blend in, huh?

753
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,560
Did I scowl at you?

754
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:30,920
No, you smiled.
I did?

755
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:34,200
Yes, it was a complete accident.
A freak. I haven't seen it since.

756
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,960
Just that one time.
Like that, but bigger.

757
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:41,240
Bigger. Yeah, big... big...

758
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:43,960
Well, not that big.

759
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,440
My goodness.

760
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:55,760
Marcello, come here.
Hurry up.

761
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:02,960
Why do they switch
the "R"s and the "L"s here?

762
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:06,840
Oh, for yuks.
You know, just to mix it up.

763
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,720
They have to amuse themselves.
'Cause we're not makin' 'em laugh.

764
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:17,200
Let's never come here again,
'cause it would never be as much fun.

765
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:22,200
Whatever you say.
You're the boss.

766
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,560
I'm stuck.

767
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,360
Does it get easier?

768
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,440
No.

769
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,560
Yes.

770
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,680
It gets easier.

771
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,640
Oh, yeah?

772
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,640
Look at you.

773
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,560
Thanks.

774
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:52,000
The more you know
who you are,

775
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,160
and what you want,

776
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:56,920
the less you let...

777
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,120
things upset you.

778
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,920
Yeah.

779
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:05,320
I just don't know
what I'm supposed to be.

780
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,200
You know?

781
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,120
I tried being a writer, but...

782
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,040
I hate what I write.

783
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:15,800
And I tried taking pictures,

784
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:19,040
but they're so mediocre,
you know.

785
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:22,840
Every girl goes through
a photography phase.

786
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,440
You know, like horses?

787
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:29,320
You know?
Take, uh, dumb pictures of your feet.

788
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:34,960
You'll figure that out.

789
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,520
I'm not worried about you.

790
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,840
Keep writing.

791
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,600
But I'm so mean.

792
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,680
Mean's okay.
Yeah?

793
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,840
What about marriage?
Does that get easier?

794
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,880
That's hard.

795
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,920
We used to have
a lot of fun.

796
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:20,840
Lydia would come with me
when I made the movies,

797
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,840
and we would laugh
about it all.

798
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:28,200
Now she doesn't want
to leave the kids, and...

799
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:31,000
she doesn't...

800
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:34,080
need me to be there.

801
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:37,320
The kids miss me,
but they're fine.

802
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:43,800
It gets a whole lot more complicated
when you have kids.

803
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:45,840
Yeah. It's scary.

804
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:52,440
It's the most terrifying day of your life
the day the first one is born.

805
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,120
Yeah. Nobody ever tells you that.

806
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:59,480
Your life,

807
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:01,400
as you know it,

808
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,960
is gone.

809
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:05,880
Never to return.

810
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:10,560
But they learn how to walk,
and they learn how to talk, and...

811
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:15,000
and you want to be with them.

812
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:18,320
And they turn out to be the most...

813
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,480
delightful people...

814
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,400
you will ever meet in your life.

815
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:24,680
Hmm, that's nice.

816
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,160
Where'd you grow up?

817
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:43,160
Um, I grew up in New York,

818
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:46,160
and I moved to Los Angeles
when John and I got married.

819
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:50,000
But it's so different there.

820
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,480
Yeah, I know.

821
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:56,040
John thinks I'm so snotty.

822
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:02,520
Hmm.

823
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:17,360
You're not hopeless.

824
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,880
Hello?

825
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,240
Mr. Harris? A fax for you.
Yes.

826
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:40,560
Okay.
Can you send it up?

827
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:44,000
Do you think you can kick it under
the door, slide it under the door, please?

828
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:47,160
Do you want I send it to your room?
Just slide it under the door, please.

829
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:50,560
Thank you. Okay. All right, bye.
Thank you, Mr. Harris.

830
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:27,640
Hey, Ms. Kawasaki.
It's Bob Harris.

831
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:31,360
Yes, I would love
to do his talk show.

832
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:33,280
I would.

833
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:36,040
I would love
to change my plans and stay.

834
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,880
American movie star.

835
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,360
Ladies and gentlemen,

836
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:06,480
Mr. Bob Harris!

837
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,440
Come on!
Da de da de, da de da dah.

838
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:13,520
Da de da dah!
Whoo!

839
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:15,480
Come on, Bob.
Come on, Bob.

840
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,680
Bobby, come on!
Bobby, come on!

841
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:20,320
Whoo! Nice to meet you.

842
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:26,040
He said you guys are
e-mailing together.

843
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,120
Ah. He wants to
show you his dance.

844
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,440
Japanese dance step.
Uh... Uh... Japanese dance.

845
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:39,360
Do I... Do I have to
dance with him?

846
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:41,600
To-tung a-tung. To-tung a-tung.

847
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:44,200
To-tung a-tung. To-tung a-tung

848
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:47,040
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby...

849
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:51,400
Welcome, Bob. He was saying, "Welcome, Bob."
What?

850
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,200
Hello?
Bob?

851
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:36,320
Hi, Lydia.
Is this a bad time?

852
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,640
No, it's always a good time.

853
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:42,640
Look, um, your burgundy carpet
isn't in stock.

854
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:46,040
It's gonna take 12 weeks.
Did you like any of the other colors?

855
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:53,200
Whatever you like.
I-I'm completely lost.

856
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:55,160
It's just carpet.

857
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:59,600
That's not what I'm talking about.
What are you talking about?

858
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:04,880
I don't know.
I just want to get healthy.

859
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,600
You know, I want to take
better care of myself.

860
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:10,560
I would like to start
eating healthier.

861
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:12,720
I don't want all that pasta.

862
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,680
What?

863
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,560
I would like to start eating,
like, Japanese food.

864
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:21,720
Well, why don't you just stay there,
and you can have it every day?

865
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,480
How are the kids doin'?

866
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,080
They're fine.
They miss their father.

867
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:35,120
But they're getting used to
you not being here.

868
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,200
Do I need to worry
about you, Bob?

869
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:40,960
Only if you want to.

870
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,040
Bob, I got things to do.

871
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:47,360
I gotta go.
Okay.

872
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,160
I'll see you...
I mean, I'll talk to you later.

873
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:54,800
Okay.
Okay, bye.

874
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,760
Bye.

875
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:37,680
Matthew Smellick!

876
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:41,560
Matthew "Snellick. "

877
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,400
Thank you. Thank you so much.

878
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,040
We'll take a really short break,
and we'll see you in a minute.

879
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,480
Hi. Uh, champagne.
Thanks.

880
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,800
Hi.

881
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:27,880
Midnight at the oasis

882
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,360
Send your camel to bed

883
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:33,880
Shadows paintin'our faces

884
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:38,960
Traces of romance in our heads

885
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:42,400
Heaven's holding a half moon

886
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,320
I got it.

887
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:52,760
Have a rough night?

888
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:58,120
Um, I'm going to that place,
that sushi place in Daikanyama.

889
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:00,760
You wanna come?
Yeah, but I can't right now.

890
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:05,560
Midnight at the oasis

891
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:08,160
Send your camel to bed
Yeah, I guess you're busy, huh?

892
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:11,840
Shadows paintin'our faces

893
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:15,000
Traces of romance in our heads

894
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:23,920
Hello?
Hello? Bob, it's me.

895
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:27,240
Hello?
It's Lydia, your wife.

896
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,560
Oh, I'm...
I couldn't hear ya.

897
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:32,880
Hey, you want to talk to Zoe?
Yeah.

898
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,840
Zoe, come say hello
to your father.

899
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,240
No. Uh, she just ran into
the other room.

900
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,640
It's okay. It's okay.

901
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:43,000
Okay, um, her ballet recital
is Sunday. Don't forget.

902
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:44,920
I didn't forget.

903
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:47,600
Well, travel safely.
I'll see you soon.

904
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:50,120
Mommy!
Okay.

905
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:52,480
Okay. Bye.

906
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:54,520
Bye.

907
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:07,360
Well, she is closer
to your age.

908
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,920
You could talk about things
you have in common,

909
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,840
like, um,

910
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,760
growing up in the '50s.

911
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:18,000
Maybe she liked the movies
you were making in the '70s,

912
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:20,600
when you still were making movies.

913
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:23,960
Wasn't there anyone else there
to lavish you with attention?

914
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,640
I'm switchin' to beer.
Okay?

915
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:36,560
Biru?

916
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,840
I can't tell the difference.

917
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,440
We'll have
two of these, okay?

918
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:42,200
To your nearest exit...

919
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:45,320
and leave the building.

920
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:48,760
Await instructions
from the authorities.

921
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:11,680
That was the worst lunch.

922
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:14,000
So bad.

923
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:16,720
What kind of restaurant
makes you cook your own food?

924
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:25,160
When are you leaving?

925
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:29,600
Tomorrow.

926
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,320
I'll miss you.

927
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:51,160
I'm so into you

928
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:04,160
When you walked into the room

929
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:08,040
There was voodoo in the vibes

930
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:14,800
I was captured by your style

931
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:18,960
But I could not
catch your eyes

932
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:27,120
I don't want to leave.

933
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,480
So don't.
Stay here with me.

934
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,320
We'll start a jazz band.

935
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:41,240
I am so into you, baby

936
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:03,840
Good night.
Good night. Okay.

937
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:06,080
Good night.

938
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:16,080
Okay.

939
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:18,040
Okay. Good night.
Good night.

940
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:53,280
Good morning, Mr. Harris. Have a nice flight.
Thank you.

941
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:55,200
Thank you.
Good-bye

942
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:58,240
I'll be one minute.

943
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:11,760
Charlotte, I'm down in the lobby,
and I'm leaving now.

944
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:14,240
Um, I was calling...

945
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:16,160
to see if you still
have my jacket.

946
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:18,520
If you could you bring it down,
but you're not there,

947
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:22,560
so this is good-bye,
and, uh...

948
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:26,720
So,

949
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:30,280
I guess, good-bye and enjoy
my jacket which you stole...

950
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,200
from me.

951
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:40,680
Hello.
Hello.

952
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,320
How are you?
I'm good. How are you?

953
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:45,240
Mr. Harris...

954
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:48,920
Thank you for coming. Enjoy your, your trip?
I had a great time.

955
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:50,840
I had a very good time.

956
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:54,960
Excuse me. Ar-Aren't you Bob Harris?
Yes, I am.

958
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,840
What are you doing here in Japan?

You're welcome.
Thought I'd missed you.

962
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:18,000
Are you going right now?
Yeah. And my bodyguards are in here.

963
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:29,520
All right. Aren't you gonna wish me
"Have a good 'fright,"' or something?

964
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:32,120
Yeah, right.

965
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:38,920
Okay. Well, bye.
All right.

967
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:47,320

Listen to the girl

975
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:23,080
As she takes on half the world

976
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:26,960
Moving up and so alive

977
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:30,680
In her honey dripping

978
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:32,640
Beehive

979
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:38,160
Beehive
It's good, so good

980
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:41,880
All right.

981
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:44,360
So good

982
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:49,200
Walking back to you

983
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:52,280
Is the hardest thing that

984
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:56,920

I'll be your plastic toy

989

For you

990
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:19,600
Eating up the scum

991
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:22,280
Is the hardest thing for
