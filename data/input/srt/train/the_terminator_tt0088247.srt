1
00:04:05,317 --> 00:04:09,274
What the hell? Goddamn
son of a bitch...

2
00:04:10,741 --> 00:04:12,342
Goddamn son of a...

3
00:04:24,452 --> 00:04:26,287
What the hell?

4
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,008
Hey, my turn!

5
00:05:24,412 --> 00:05:25,979
Me.

6
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,051
Come on.

7
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,190
Hey, what's wrong
with this picture?

8
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,298
Nice night for a walk, eh?

9
00:05:48,937 --> 00:05:51,071
Nice night for a walk.

10
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:55,626
Washday tomorrow.
Nothing clean, right?

11
00:05:55,694 --> 00:05:57,495
Nothing clean. Right.

12
00:05:57,563 --> 00:06:00,615
I think this guy's a couple
cans short of a six-pack.

13
00:06:00,783 --> 00:06:02,092
Your clothes.

14
00:06:03,018 --> 00:06:04,911
Give them to me. Now.

15
00:06:05,653 --> 00:06:07,372
Fuck you, asshole!

16
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,354
Hey, sugar, how about it?

17
00:06:40,922 --> 00:06:45,559
I don't have to put up
with that bullshit, man.

18
00:06:45,627 --> 00:06:48,028
She's always after me.

19
00:06:48,596 --> 00:06:50,230
I don't... I don't...

20
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:54,895
Hey, buddy. Did you just
see a real bright light?

21
00:07:57,247 --> 00:07:58,614
See that guy?

22
00:07:58,682 --> 00:08:00,900
- Hold it right there!
- He's rabbiting.

23
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:03,937
- Hey! I said hold it!
- Go!

24
00:08:04,805 --> 00:08:07,974
That son of a bitch took my pants!

25
00:08:51,551 --> 00:08:55,787
- What day is it? The date!
- 12th... May. Thursday.

26
00:08:55,855 --> 00:08:58,190
- What year?!
- What?

27
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,039
He's got my gun! Let's go!

28
00:10:38,124 --> 00:10:41,575
<i>3831, they lost the suspect.</i>

29
00:12:07,577 --> 00:12:09,830
Guard it for me, big buns.

30
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:15,402
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm late.

31
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,688
So am I.

32
00:13:01,464 --> 00:13:03,549
- I'm in it.
- So am I.

33
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,973
Honey, could I have
that coffee now, please?

34
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,114
Yes, sir.

35
00:13:13,141 --> 00:13:15,843
- OK, who gets the burly beef?
- Uh, I ordered barbecued beef.

36
00:13:15,846 --> 00:13:17,261
I think that's mine, but
I didn't order fries.

37
00:13:17,273 --> 00:13:18,146
He gets the barbecued beef.

38
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,932
- Mine's the chili beef deluxe.
- OK, who gets the burly beef?

39
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,586
- Miss, we're ready to order now.
- Yes, ma'am.

40
00:13:23,754 --> 00:13:24,754
Aah!

41
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,993
Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh, lord.

42
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:33,112
This isn't real leather, is it?

43
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,463
This special sucks.

44
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:39,002
Nice going, kid. Ought
to give you the tip.

45
00:13:41,604 --> 00:13:44,941
Look at it this way... in a hundred
years, who's going to care?

46
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,883
The twelve-gauge auto-loader.

47
00:13:57,286 --> 00:14:01,057
That's Italian. You
can go pump or auto.

48
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,777
The .45 long slide,
with laser sighting.

49
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:08,330
These are brand-new. We just
got them in. That's a good gun.

50
00:14:08,898 --> 00:14:11,567
Just touch the trigger, the beam
comes on, and you put the red dot

51
00:14:11,568 --> 00:14:14,386
where you want the bullet
to go. You can't miss.

52
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:17,739
Anything else?

53
00:14:17,807 --> 00:14:20,242
A phased plasma rifle
in the 40-watt range.

54
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,344
Just what you see, pal.

55
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,363
The Uzi 9mm.

56
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:31,002
You know your weapons, buddy. Any one
of these is ideal for home defense.

57
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:35,056
So, uh... which will it be?

58
00:14:35,224 --> 00:14:36,274
All.

59
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:38,842
I may close early today.

60
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:43,447
There's a 15-day wait on the handguns,
but the rifles you can take right now.

61
00:14:44,015 --> 00:14:45,534
You can't do that.

62
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:47,219
Wrong.

63
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:16,397
Hi, baby. Yeah, yeah, it's me.

64
00:15:16,465 --> 00:15:20,135
Listen, I need you to come pick
me up. My bike just broke down.

65
00:15:20,702 --> 00:15:23,604
I don't care what you're doing.
Come and get me. What the...

66
00:15:24,572 --> 00:15:28,826
Hey, man, you got a
serious attitude problem.

67
00:16:21,763 --> 00:16:24,631
- Sarah Connor?
- Yes?

68
00:16:36,978 --> 00:16:39,446
I'm on my break, Chuck.
Carla's got my station.

69
00:16:39,447 --> 00:16:42,816
Sarah, come here!
It's about you. I mean, sort of.

70
00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:47,696
It's so incredible. You're
not gonna believe this.

71
00:16:47,722 --> 00:16:49,780
Sit down. You are
going to love this.

72
00:16:49,823 --> 00:16:51,624
- Shh!
- What?

73
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,191
<i>Has been compiled
from several witnesses.</i>

74
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:57,397
<i>Once again, Sarah Connor,
thirty-five, mother of two,</i>

<i>brutally shot to death

First, I'm gonna rip the buttons
off your blouse, one by one...

104
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,465
You fuckin' pigs! Wait till
I get my hands on you!

105
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:05,868
- Get off of me!
- Sit down, fella.

106
00:22:06,636 --> 00:22:07,869
Ed.

107
00:22:10,106 --> 00:22:12,208
- What do you got?
- Dead girl.

108
00:22:12,275 --> 00:22:15,978
- I can see that.
- Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35,

109
00:22:16,046 --> 00:22:19,982
shot six times at less than ten
feet. Large caliber weapon.

110
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,616
You know, these work.

111
00:22:23,186 --> 00:22:24,719
What's this?

112
00:22:24,787 --> 00:22:28,323
Dead girl 2, sent over from
Valley Division this afternoon.

113
00:22:30,459 --> 00:22:34,913
- I'm sure there's a point to all of this.
- Look at the name, Ed.

114
00:22:35,682 --> 00:22:39,835
Sarah Louise... Connor.
Is this right?

115
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:42,571
You're kidding me.

116
00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:45,341
The press is going to be
short-stroking it all over the place.

117
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:47,231
A one-day pattern killer.

118
00:22:48,457 --> 00:22:49,620
I hate the weird ones.

119
00:22:54,316 --> 00:22:55,783
So...

120
00:22:57,619 --> 00:22:59,587
Better than mortal man deserves.

121
00:23:07,163 --> 00:23:11,333
- Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?
- No, not lately. Did you check messages?

122
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,167
Uh-uh. I thought you did.

123
00:23:17,573 --> 00:23:19,541
<i>Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...</i>

124
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:22,031
There you are, young man.

125
00:23:22,057 --> 00:23:26,589
- You mind your mother.
<i>- So call me back, will you, dear? Uh, bye.</i>

126
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:31,637
<i>Hi, Sarah. Dan Moorski.
Uh, something's come up,</i>

127
00:23:31,638 --> 00:23:34,138
<i>and it looks like I won't
be able to make it tonight.</i>

128
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:37,675
<i>Just can't get out of it. Look, I'm
really sorry. I'll make it up to you.</i>

129
00:23:37,743 --> 00:23:40,678
<i>Call you in a day or so,
OK? Sorry. Bye.</i>

130
00:23:42,146 --> 00:23:45,549
That bum. So what if
he has a Porsche?

131
00:23:45,617 --> 00:23:49,021
He can't treat you like this. It's
Friday night, for Christ's sake!

132
00:23:50,489 --> 00:23:52,156
I'll live.

133
00:23:52,524 --> 00:23:54,724
I'll break his kneecaps.

134
00:23:55,493 --> 00:23:59,463
Well... Pugsley still loves
me, don't you, baby?

135
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:03,267
God. It's disgusting.

136
00:24:05,034 --> 00:24:06,887
- I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.
- OK.

137
00:24:06,955 --> 00:24:10,090
- You and Matt have a good time.
- We will. You, too.

138
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:11,176
OK.

139
00:24:15,264 --> 00:24:17,063
Damn it, Matt!

140
00:25:13,703 --> 00:25:15,237
Oh, shit.

141
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:18,105
Lieutenant, are you aware
that these two killings

142
00:25:18,107 --> 00:25:20,409
occurred in the same order as
their listings in the phone book?

143
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,711
Now, what can I tell you
guys? No comment.

144
00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:24,580
But, lieutenant, we've
got two murders...

145
00:25:35,725 --> 00:25:39,094
- That coffee's two hours cold.
- Mm-hmm.

146
00:25:39,161 --> 00:25:41,030
I put a cigarette out in it.

147
00:25:42,297 --> 00:25:45,633
- Did you reach the next girl yet?
- No. I keep getting an answering machine.

148
00:25:45,701 --> 00:25:47,075
- Send a unit.
- I sent a unit.

149
00:25:47,101 --> 00:25:49,605
There's no answer at the door, and
the apartment manager's not home.

150
00:25:49,672 --> 00:25:50,481
Call her.

151
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,690
- I just called her.
- Call her again.

152
00:25:53,316 --> 00:25:54,802
Give me a cigarette.

153
00:26:05,704 --> 00:26:07,071
<i>Hi there.</i>

154
00:26:07,739 --> 00:26:12,543
<i>Ha ha ha. Fooled you. You're talking to

00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:27,541
I can hear it now. He's gonna be called
the goddamn "Phone Book killer."

157
00:26:27,609 --> 00:26:32,779
I hate these press cases,
especially the weird press cases.

158
00:26:34,216 --> 00:26:36,901
- Where you going?
- To make a statement.

159
00:26:37,068 --> 00:26:39,436
Maybe make these jackals
work for us for a change.

160

- Like shit, boss.

Connor was pronounced dead at the scene</i>

<i>- in her Santa Monica apartment...</i>
- Can we change this?

Ford, headed westbound on 7th.

267
00:40:08,552 --> 00:40:11,832
This is a mistake.
I didn't do anything.

268
00:40:11,858 --> 00:40:15,511
No, but you will. It's very
important that you live.

269
00:40:15,837 --> 00:40:19,581
This isn't true. How could that
man just get up after you...

270
00:40:19,582 --> 00:40:22,052
He's not a man. A machine.

271
00:40:22,302 --> 00:40:26,502
A Terminator. A Cyberdine
systems model 101.

272
00:40:34,427 --> 00:40:35,799
A machine?

273
00:40:36,925 --> 00:40:41,350
- Like a robot?
- Not a robot. A cyborg.

274
00:40:41,618 --> 00:40:43,197
A cybernetic organism.

275
00:40:43,223 --> 00:40:46,155
- No. He was bleeding.
- Just a second.

276
00:40:49,325 --> 00:40:50,675
Get your head down!

277
00:41:35,387 --> 00:41:38,856
All right, listen. The Terminator's
an infiltration unit...

278
00:41:38,924 --> 00:41:43,527
part man, part machine. Underneath,
it's a hyperalloy combat chassis...

279
00:41:43,595 --> 00:41:47,348
microprocessor controlled,
fully armored, very tough.

280
00:41:47,349 --> 00:41:49,782
But outside, it's
living human tissue.

281
00:41:50,118 --> 00:41:54,271
Flesh, skin, hair, blood...
grown for the cyborgs.

282
00:41:54,339 --> 00:41:55,839
Look, Reese, I don't know
what you want from...

283
00:41:55,907 --> 00:41:59,077
Pay attention! I got
to ditch this car.

284
00:42:04,351 --> 00:42:08,303
The 600 series had rubber
skin. We spotted them easy.

285
00:42:08,371 --> 00:42:10,938
But these are new.
They look human...

286
00:42:11,006 --> 00:42:15,025
Sweat, bad breath, everything.
Very hard to spot.

287
00:42:15,193 --> 00:42:17,995
I had to wait till he moved on
you before I could zero him.

288
00:42:18,563 --> 00:42:24,660
Look... I am not stupid, you know.
They cannot make things like that yet.

289
00:42:24,686 --> 00:42:28,748
Not yet. Not for about forty years.

290
00:42:31,026 --> 00:42:35,595
- Are you saying it's from the future?
- One possible future.

291
00:42:36,063 --> 00:42:39,183
From your point of view...
I don't know tech stuff.

292
00:42:40,518 --> 00:42:43,320
Then you're from the future,
too, is that right?

293
00:42:43,388 --> 00:42:45,573
- Right.
- Right.

294
00:42:53,447 --> 00:42:57,000
Cyborgs don't feel pain. I do.

295
00:42:57,268 --> 00:42:58,752
Don't do that again.

296
00:42:58,819 --> 00:43:01,255
- Just let me go.
- Listen!

297
00:43:01,423 --> 00:43:05,910
And understand. That
Terminator is out there.

298
00:43:06,812 --> 00:43:11,182
It can't be bargained with.
It can't be reasoned with.

299
00:43:11,249 --> 00:43:15,485
It doesn't feel pity
or remorse or fear.

300
00:43:15,553 --> 00:43:19,222
And it absolutely
will not stop. Ever!

301
00:43:19,589 --> 00:43:22,075
Until you are dead.

302
00:43:31,503 --> 00:43:33,404
Can you stop it?

303
00:43:37,491 --> 00:43:39,091
I don't know.

304
00:43:40,794 --> 00:43:43,679
With these weapons, I don't know.

305
00:43:59,813 --> 00:44:02,733
<i>All units. All units. Gray Ford
suspect vehicle's been found</i>

306
00:44:02,734 --> 00:44:05,401
<i>in a parking structure
at 4th and Beaudry.</i>

307
00:44:47,493 --> 00:44:48,727
Reese.

308
00:44:49,813 --> 00:44:51,781
Why me?

309
00:44:53,817 --> 00:44:55,835
Why does it want me?

310
00:45:02,308 --> 00:45:04,409
There was a nuclear war...

311
00:45:06,212 --> 00:45:08,413
A few years from now.

312
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:12,484
All this...

313
00:45:12,853 --> 00:45:16,056
This whole place. Everything.

314
00:45:16,724 --> 00:45:18,290
It's gone.

315
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,628
Just gone.

316
00:45:21,995 --> 00:45:23,896
There were survivors.

317
00:45:24,064 --> 00:45:26,515
Here. There.

318
00:45:28,918 --> 00:45:31,120
Nobody even knew who started it.

319
00:45:33,923 --> 00:45:36,190
It was the machines, Sarah.

320
00:45:37,459 --> 00:45:41,597
- I don't understand.
- Defense network computers.

321
00:45:42,432 --> 00:45:46,001
New... powerful...

322
00:45:46,568 --> 00:45:51,006
Hooked into everything.
Trusted to run it all.

323
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:56,627
They say it got smart...
a new order of intelligence.

324
00:45:57,395 --> 00:46:01,851
Then it saw <i>all</i> people as a threat,
not just the ones on the other side.

325
00:46:02,918 --> 00:46:05,820
Decided our fate in
a microsecond...

326
00:46:07,388 --> 00:46:09,157
extermination.

327
00:46:23,437 --> 00:46:25,672
Did you see this war?

328
00:46:37,418 --> 00:46:40,837
No. I grew up after it...

329
00:46:40,905 --> 00:46:44,141
In the ruins. Starving...

330
00:46:44,208 --> 00:46:46,560
- Hiding from HKs.
- HKs?

331
00:46:46,628 --> 00:46:51,680
Hunter-killers. Patrol machines
built in automated factories.

332
00:46:52,348 --> 00:46:57,171
Most of us were rounded up, put
in camps for orderly disposal.

333
00:46:58,839 --> 00:47:01,690
This was burned in
by laser scanner.

334
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:09,901
Some of us were
kept alive... to work...

335
00:47:10,767 --> 00:47:16,221
Loading bodies. The disposal
units ran night and day.

336
00:47:16,289 --> 00:47:19,659
We were that close
to going out forever.

337
00:47:22,127 --> 00:47:25,998
But there was one man
who taught us to fight,

338
00:47:26,066 --> 00:47:31,871
to storm the wire of the camps, to smash
those metal motherfuckers into junk.

339
00:47:32,839 --> 00:47:36,042
He turned it around. He brought
us back from the brink.

340
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:40,253
His name was Connor. John Connor.

341
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,381
Your son, Sarah.

342
00:47:43,417 --> 00:47:45,451
Your unborn son.

343
00:49:35,094 --> 00:49:36,511
Drive!

344
00:49:43,335 --> 00:49:46,402
Reese!

345
00:50:04,189 --> 00:50:07,690
No, Reese! No! No!
No! They'll kill you.

346
00:50:07,758 --> 00:50:11,111
You in the Cadillac!
Let me see your hands now!

347
00:50:13,648 --> 00:50:15,215
Get out of the car!

348
00:50:18,887 --> 00:50:20,756
Drop to your knees!

349
00:50:21,123 --> 00:50:23,890
- Out of the car.
- Drop to the ground.

350
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,220
Sarah...

351
00:50:54,488 --> 00:50:56,891
Sarah, try to drink some of this.

352
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:04,581
Listen, are you sure it's them? Maybe...
maybe I should look at the bodies.

353
00:51:04,749 --> 00:51:07,483
No. They've been identified,
and there's no doubt.

354
00:51:07,551 --> 00:51:09,718
Oh, God.

355
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,387
God!

356
00:51:11,454 --> 00:51:13,557
Ginger!

357
00:51:16,794 --> 00:51:18,228
Sarah.

358
00:51:19,063 --> 00:51:21,899
- Sarah, this is Dr. Silberman.
- Hi, Sarah.

359
00:51:21,967 --> 00:51:24,952
I want you to tell him
everything that Reese told you.

360
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:28,588
- Do you feel up to that?
- Yeah. I guess so.

361
00:51:30,223 --> 00:51:31,891
You're a doctor?

362
00:51:32,359 --> 00:51:36,012
- Criminal psychologist.
- Is Reese crazy?

363
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,509
Well, that's what
we're gonna find out.

364
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:07,402
So, you're a soldier,
fighting for whom?

365
00:53:08,838 --> 00:53:14,276
With the 132nd, under
Perry. From '21 to '27.

366
00:53:14,443 --> 00:53:19,196
- That's the year 2027?
- That's right. And I was assigned...

367
00:53:19,264 --> 00:53:20,865
This is fucking great.

368
00:53:20,932 --> 00:53:23,253
The last two years
under John Connor.

369
00:53:23,279 --> 00:53:26,587
- Who was the enemy again?
- A computer defense system built for...

370
00:53:26,588 --> 00:53:29,106
Oh, damn. Sorry.

371
00:53:29,141 --> 00:53:32,477
Built for SAC-NORAD
by Cyberdine systems.

372
00:53:32,545 --> 00:53:33,979
I see.

373
00:53:34,547 --> 00:53:40,518
And this, uh, computer thinks it can win
by killing the mother of its enemy,

374
00:53:40,686 --> 00:53:44,238
killing him, in effect,
before he's even conceived,

375
00:53:44,305 --> 00:53:46,607
a sort of retroactive abortion?

376
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:49,409
That guy Silberman cracks me up.

377
00:53:49,477 --> 00:53:52,236
Last week, he had this guy in here that
burned his Afghan. He screwed it first,

378
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:54,215
- then he set it on fire.
- Hey, shut up.

379
00:53:54,283 --> 00:53:56,400
Why didn't the computer
just kill Connor then?

380
00:53:56,468 --> 00:53:59,370
Why this elaborate scheme
with the Terminator?

381
00:53:59,437 --> 00:54:03,691
It had no choice. Their
defense grid was smashed.

382
00:54:03,758 --> 00:54:07,912
We'd won. Taking out Connor
then would make no difference.

383
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:11,265
Skynet had to wipe out
his entire existence.

384
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:15,219
Is that when you captured the lab complex
and found that... uh, what is it called?

385
00:54:15,287 --> 00:54:18,389
Uh... the time
displacement equipment?

386
00:54:18,657 --> 00:54:22,759
That's right. The Terminator
had already gone through.

387
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:26,229
Connor sent me to intercept,
and they blew the whole place.

388
00:54:26,397 --> 00:54:28,415
How are you supposed get back?

389
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:30,109
I can't.

390
00:54:31,787 --> 00:54:33,788
Nobody goes home.

391
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:41,328
Nobody else comes through.
It's just him and me.

392
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:28,933
It's just him and me.

393
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:36,457
Why didn't you bring any weapons,
something more advanced?

394
00:56:36,525 --> 00:56:39,461
Don't you have ray guns?

395
00:56:40,229 --> 00:56:41,295
Ray guns.

396
00:56:41,363 --> 00:56:43,898
Show me a piece of
future technology.

397
00:56:43,966 --> 00:56:48,209
You go naked. Something about the
field generated by a living organism.

398
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:50,438
- Nothing dead will go.
- Why?

399
00:56:50,506 --> 00:56:54,776
- I didn't build the fucking thing!
- OK, OK. But this...

400
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:58,380
- Cyborg, if it's metal...
- Surrounded by living tissue!

401
00:56:58,448 --> 00:56:59,631
Oh. Right, right...

402
00:57:00,499 --> 00:57:03,434
This is great stuff. I could
make a career out of this guy.

403
00:57:03,501 --> 00:57:06,369
You see how clever this part is? How
it doesn't require a shred of proof?

404
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:10,441
And most paranoid delusions are
intricate, but this is brilliant.

405
00:57:11,742 --> 00:57:14,127
Why were the other
two women killed?

406
00:57:14,153 --> 00:57:16,322
Most of the records
were lost in the war.

407
00:57:16,365 --> 00:57:21,230
Skynet knew almost nothing about Connor's
mother. Her full name, where she lived.

408
00:57:21,256 --> 00:57:24,897
They just knew the city. The
Terminator was just being systematic.

409
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:28,736
- Uh-huh. Well, let's go back to...
- Look, you have heard enough!

410
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:32,296
I have answered your questions!
Now I have to see Sarah Connor!

411
00:57:32,298 --> 00:57:35,749
- I'm afraid that's not up to me.
- Then why am I talking to you?

412
00:57:35,817 --> 00:57:37,818
- Because I can help you.
- Who is in authority here?

413
00:57:37,844 --> 00:57:39,653
- Reese...
- Shut up!

414
00:57:40,222 --> 00:57:42,790
You still don't get it, do you?

415
00:57:42,958 --> 00:57:46,393
He'll find her.
That's what he does!

416
00:57:46,461 --> 00:57:50,198
That's all he does!
You can't stop him!

417
00:57:50,201 --> 00:57:54,436
He'll wade through you, reach down her
throat, and pull her fucking heart out!

418
00:57:54,468 --> 00:57:57,220
- Doc.
- Let... let go of me!

419
00:58:00,874 --> 00:58:02,242
Sorry.

420
00:58:07,147 --> 00:58:10,801
- So, Reese is crazy?
- In technical terminology...

421
00:58:10,969 --> 00:58:12,536
He's a loon.

422
00:58:12,904 --> 00:58:16,307
Sarah, this is what
they call body armor.

423
00:58:16,674 --> 00:58:20,777
Our TAC guys wear these. It'll
stop a twelve-gauge round.

424
00:58:20,845 --> 00:58:23,281
This other individual
must have been wearing

425
00:58:23,293 --> 00:58:25,523
one under his coat. Feel that.
Go ahead.

426
00:58:27,184 --> 00:58:29,218
What about when he punched
through the windshield?

427
00:58:29,286 --> 00:58:31,905
He was probably on PCP.
Broke every bone in his hand

428
00:58:31,973 --> 00:58:34,803
and wouldn't feel it for hours.
There was this guy once...

429
00:58:34,829 --> 00:58:36,344
- You see this scar?
- Here.

430
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:37,878
Thank you.

431
00:58:38,246 --> 00:58:40,363
There's a couch in this other room.
Why don't

432
00:58:40,375 --> 00:58:42,366
you stretch out and try
to get some sleep?

433
00:58:42,433 --> 00:58:44,914
It'll be at least an hour before your
mother gets here from Big Bear.

434
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:47,905
- I can't sleep.
- Try.

435
00:58:48,073 --> 00:58:52,225
Well, it may not look it, but
that couch is very comfortable.

436
00:58:53,594 --> 00:58:58,399
You'll be perfectly safe. We got
thirty cops in this building.

437
00:58:59,266 --> 00:59:00,632
Thank you.

438
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,641
- Good night.
- Good night.

439
00:59:22,955 --> 00:59:24,964
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.

440
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:27,149
I was told that she's here.
Could I see her, please?

441
00:59:27,175 --> 00:59:29,829
No. You can't see her.
She's making a statement.

442
00:59:29,855 --> 00:59:32,614
- Where is she?
- Look, it may take a while...

443
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,944
if you want to wait, there's
a bench over there.

444
00:59:45,845 --> 00:59:47,797
I'll be back.

445
01:00:14,624 --> 01:00:16,626
What the hell was that?

446
01:00:25,951 --> 01:00:27,236
Gunshot!

447
01:00:36,013 --> 01:00:38,916
- What is it, terrorists?
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

448
01:00:43,169 --> 01:00:45,071
Stay here.

449
01:00:58,735 --> 01:00:59,791
Let's get out of here!

450
01:00:59,817 --> 01:01:02,798
- Come on! Come on!
- He's got an automatic weapon!

451
01:01:05,341 --> 01:01:07,426
Move it, move it, move it, move it!

452
01:01:18,054 --> 01:01:20,104
What the hell happened
to the lights?

453
01:01:24,711 --> 01:01:26,178
Watch him.

454
01:01:46,649 --> 01:01:49,535
Automatic weapons!
Lock and load! Let's go!

455
01:02:17,595 --> 01:02:19,095
Fire! Fire!

456
01:02:33,443 --> 01:02:35,111
Ed.

457
01:02:35,913 --> 01:02:37,347
Hey!

458
01:03:03,924 --> 01:03:05,258
Sarah!

459
01:03:06,844 --> 01:03:08,211
Reese!

460
01:03:12,183 --> 01:03:13,568
This way.

461
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:56,550
<i>KFLB news time 4:36.</i>

462
01:03:56,576 --> 01:03:59,833
<i>In the top story of the hour, the
largest single law enforcement</i>

463
01:03:59,859 --> 01:04:03,348
<i>mobilization in California
history is currently underway.</i>

464
01:04:03,349 --> 01:04:04,994
<i>Police in five Southern counties...</i>

465
01:04:04,995 --> 01:04:07,685
<i>are engaged in a massive
manhunt for an unident...</i>

466
01:04:10,724 --> 01:04:12,291
Take this.

467
01:04:15,128 --> 01:04:17,430
All right, let's get
this off the road.

468
01:04:48,878 --> 01:04:52,030
- You cold?
- Freezing.

469
01:05:05,811 --> 01:05:07,329
Reese...

470
01:05:08,464 --> 01:05:10,532
You got a first name?

471
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:12,016
Kyle.

472
01:05:12,284 --> 01:05:16,755
Kyle... what's it like
when you go through time?

473
01:05:19,758 --> 01:05:21,426
White light.

474
01:05:24,063 --> 01:05:25,630
Pain.

475
01:05:28,666 --> 01:05:32,587
- It's like being born maybe.
- Oh, my God.

476
01:05:33,655 --> 01:05:35,691
I caught one back there.

477
01:05:37,259 --> 01:05:40,395
- You mean you got shot?
- It's not bad.

478
01:05:40,963 --> 01:05:44,366
- We got to get you to a doctor.
- It's OK. Forget it.

479
01:05:44,534 --> 01:05:47,368
What do you mean,
forget it? Are you crazy?

480
01:05:48,136 --> 01:05:49,854
Take this off.

481
01:06:01,601 --> 01:06:03,083
Jesus.

482
01:06:03,551 --> 01:06:05,686
See, it passed right
through the meat.

483
01:06:06,154 --> 01:06:10,941
Oh, this is going to make me puke.
Would you just talk about something?

484
01:06:11,009 --> 01:06:12,096
What?

485
01:06:12,122 --> 01:06:16,146
I don't know. Anything.
Just talk. Tell me about my son.

486
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:18,999
He's about my height.

487
01:06:22,653 --> 01:06:24,755
He has your eyes.

488
01:06:27,994 --> 01:06:29,994
What's he like?

489
01:06:30,261 --> 01:06:34,399
You trust him. He's got a strength.

490
01:06:35,567 --> 01:06:38,085
I'd die for John Connor.

491
01:06:40,488 --> 01:06:44,491
Well... at least now I know
what to name him.

492
01:06:44,859 --> 01:06:47,250
I don't suppose you
know who the father is,

493
01:06:47,276 --> 01:06:50,172
so I won't tell him to get
lost when I meet him.

494
01:06:50,215 --> 01:06:52,648
John never said much about him.

495
01:06:53,116 --> 01:06:55,786
- I know he dies before the war...
- Wait!

496
01:06:57,622 --> 01:06:59,490
I don't want to know.

497
01:07:00,458 --> 01:07:03,660
So, was it John that sent you here?

498
01:07:04,028 --> 01:07:05,696
I volunteered.

499
01:07:06,931 --> 01:07:08,064
Why?

500
01:07:08,332 --> 01:07:13,603
It was a chance to meet the
legend... Sarah Connor.

501
01:07:14,271 --> 01:07:18,658
Taught her son to fight, organize,

502
01:07:18,726 --> 01:07:21,044
prepare from when he was a kid.

503
01:07:21,112 --> 01:07:23,564
When you were in hiding
before the war...

504
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:30,637
You're talking about things I
haven't done yet in the past tense.

505
01:07:30,705 --> 01:07:33,340
- It's driving me crazy.
- Aah!

506
01:07:36,577 --> 01:07:38,912
Are you sure you have
the right person?

507
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,947
I'm sure.

508
01:07:41,615 --> 01:07:45,053
Come on. Do I look like
the mother of the future?

509
01:07:47,121 --> 01:07:52,026
I mean, am I tough? Organized?
I can't even balance my checkbook.

510
01:07:55,063 --> 01:08:00,417
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this
honor, and I don't want it! Any of it!

511
01:08:04,022 --> 01:08:08,374
Your son gave me a message to
give to you. Made me memorize it.

512
01:08:09,342 --> 01:08:12,429
"Thank you, Sarah, for your
courage through the dark years.

513
01:08:12,497 --> 01:08:14,926
I can't help you with
what you must soon face

514
01:08:14,938 --> 01:08:17,167
except to say that the
future is not set.

515
01:08:17,168 --> 01:08:19,820
You must be stronger than
you imagine you can be.

516
01:08:19,854 --> 01:08:24,759
You must survive, or I will
never exist". That's all.

517
01:08:27,961 --> 01:08:30,146
It's a good field dressing.

518
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:35,102
You like it? It's my first.

519
01:08:38,871 --> 01:08:41,906
Get some sleep.
It will be light soon.

520
01:08:45,612 --> 01:08:47,079
OK.

521
01:08:57,607 --> 01:08:59,708
Talk to me some more.

522
01:09:02,711 --> 01:09:04,347
About what?

523
01:09:05,514 --> 01:09:08,115
Tell me about where you're from.

524
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:11,886
All right.

525
01:09:13,423 --> 01:09:18,093
You stay down by day, but at
night you can move around.

526
01:09:18,161 --> 01:09:22,332
You still have to be careful
because the HKs use infrared.

527
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:29,887
But they're not too bright. John
taught us ways to dust them.

528
01:09:30,555 --> 01:09:33,290
That's when the infiltrators
started to appear.

529
01:09:33,358 --> 01:09:36,894
The Terminators were the
newest... The worst.

530
01:09:46,555 --> 01:09:48,589
<i>Traversing your sector
in search mode.</i>

531
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:51,825
<i>750 meters north of your position.</i>

532
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:55,029
<i>Understood. 750 meters north.</i>

533
01:09:56,597 --> 01:09:58,165
Let's go.

534
01:09:58,332 --> 01:10:00,149
<i>Intercept. Over.</i>

535
01:10:02,219 --> 01:10:04,753
<i>There are scavenger teams
in that quadrant.</i>

536
01:10:04,821 --> 01:10:09,160
<i>Avoid contact. Repeat, avoid
contact. We'll get them later.</i>

537
01:10:09,827 --> 01:10:11,512
<i>Roger, echo leader.</i>

538
01:10:16,667 --> 01:10:21,238
<i>- Sector niner, what's your status?
- Situation normal.</i>

539
01:10:36,753 --> 01:10:40,557
Firebase, what's your status? Over.

540
01:10:43,194 --> 01:10:46,980
- Reese. DN384...
- Right. Let him in.

541
01:10:50,584 --> 01:10:53,536
<i>Any infiltrators at
the shopping mall?</i>

542
01:10:53,604 --> 01:10:59,442
<i>No problem. They were clean. We're
cutting short the patrol. Over.</i>

543
01:10:59,810 --> 01:11:03,797
<i>Roger, Yankee-1-7.
You are clear to return.</i>

544
01:12:18,404 --> 01:12:20,355
Terminator! Terminator!

545
01:13:37,499 --> 01:13:39,933
I was dreaming about dogs.

546
01:13:41,069 --> 01:13:43,471
We use them to spot Terminators.

547
01:13:44,738 --> 01:13:47,407
Your world is pretty terrifying.

548
01:14:25,863 --> 01:14:29,850
Hey, buddy, you got a dead
cat in there, or what?

549
01:14:37,459 --> 01:14:39,777
Fuck you, asshole.

550
01:14:58,396 --> 01:15:00,297
Goddamn!

551
01:15:01,065 --> 01:15:02,833
Thank you.

552
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:09,405
Uh, is this enough?

553
01:15:10,073 --> 01:15:13,378
Yeah, it's enough. I don't
want to ask where you got it.

554
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:21,285
- I'm coming.
- We need a room.

555
01:15:21,286 --> 01:15:23,221
- All right.
- With a kitchen.

556
01:15:23,754 --> 01:15:25,555
Do you have one with a kitchen?

557
01:15:37,617 --> 01:15:39,353
Mmm.

558
01:15:41,021 --> 01:15:43,557
I am dying for a shower.

559
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:47,578
We should check your bandage, too.

560
01:15:48,244 --> 01:15:50,980
Later. I'm going out for supplies.

561
01:15:55,568 --> 01:15:57,253
Keep this.

562
01:16:22,830 --> 01:16:26,366
No, I can't tell you where I am,
mom. I was told not to say.

563
01:16:26,367 --> 01:16:28,566
<i>Oh, but, honey, I need to
know where I can reach you.</i>

564
01:16:28,592 --> 01:16:32,012
<i>You tell me to hide out up here at
the cabin like some fugitive and...</i>

565
01:16:32,013 --> 01:16:36,317
<i>and you won't tell me what's
going on? I am worried sick, dear.</i>

566
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:38,745
OK.

567
01:16:39,913 --> 01:16:42,848
- OK, here's the number. Ready?
- Yes. Go ahead.

568
01:16:43,016 --> 01:16:46,559
<i>It's 408-555...</i>

569
01:16:46,585 --> 01:16:48,777
<i>- 1439.</i>
- Uh-huh.

570
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:51,103
<i>- Room 9. Got it?</i>
- Uh-huh.

571
01:16:51,229 --> 01:16:53,056
- I've got it.
<i>- I've got to go.</i>

572
01:16:53,224 --> 01:16:57,795
<i>I'm sorry I can't tell you more
right now. I love you, mom.</i>

573
01:17:01,533 --> 01:17:04,135
I love you, too, sweetheart.

574
01:17:16,363 --> 01:17:19,566
<i>- Tiki motel.</i>
- Give me your address there.

575
01:17:22,353 --> 01:17:23,920
What have we got?

576
01:17:27,358 --> 01:17:29,075
Mothballs.

577
01:17:30,101 --> 01:17:31,821
Corn syrup.

578
01:17:31,964 --> 01:17:35,199
Ammonia. What's for dinner?

579
01:17:35,967 --> 01:17:39,002
- Plastique.
- Mmm, that sounds good.

580
01:17:39,170 --> 01:17:40,604
What is it?

581
01:17:41,372 --> 01:17:45,041
Nitroglycerin, basically.
It's a bit more stable.

582
01:17:45,109 --> 01:17:47,278
I learned to make it
when I was a kid.

583
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:01,259
Make sure there's
none on the threads.

584
01:18:03,127 --> 01:18:04,795
Like this.

585
01:18:06,631 --> 01:18:08,666
Screw the end cap on.

586
01:18:10,334 --> 01:18:12,435
Very gently.

587
01:18:14,605 --> 01:18:17,641
You must've had a fun childhood.

588
01:18:20,610 --> 01:18:22,311
That's good.

589
01:18:22,578 --> 01:18:27,117
All right. Six more like that, and
I'll get started on the fuses.

590
01:18:37,661 --> 01:18:39,861
He'll find us, won't he?

591
01:18:42,499 --> 01:18:44,166
Probably.

592
01:19:01,883 --> 01:19:04,236
It'll never be over, will it?

593
01:19:12,546 --> 01:19:14,982
Look at me. I'm shaking.

594
01:19:15,749 --> 01:19:21,171
Some legend, huh? You must
be pretty disappointed.

595
01:19:21,940 --> 01:19:25,741
No. I'm not.

596
01:19:34,751 --> 01:19:36,318
Kyle...

597
01:19:37,254 --> 01:19:41,890
The women in your time...
what are they like?

598
01:19:44,093 --> 01:19:46,028
Good fighters.

599
01:19:46,395 --> 01:19:48,496
That's not what I meant.

600
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:52,801
Was there someone special?

601
01:19:54,303 --> 01:19:59,407
- Someone?
- A girl. You know.

602
01:20:00,510 --> 01:20:02,077
No.

603
01:20:04,731 --> 01:20:06,297
Never.

604
01:20:07,933 --> 01:20:09,500
Never?

605
01:20:14,439 --> 01:20:17,910
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

606
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:22,998
So much pain.

607
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:28,804
Pain can be controlled.
You just disconnect it.

608
01:20:28,871 --> 01:20:31,022
So you feel nothing?

609
01:20:36,112 --> 01:20:39,180
John Connor gave me a
picture of you once.

610
01:20:40,917 --> 01:20:45,954
I didn't know why at the
time. It was very old...

611
01:20:46,857 --> 01:20:50,391
Torn... faded.

612
01:20:53,728 --> 01:20:59,935
You were young like you are now.
You seemed just... a little sad.

613
01:21:01,337 --> 01:21:05,091
I used to always wonder what you
were thinking at that moment.

614
01:21:05,558 --> 01:21:08,052
I memorized every line,

615
01:21:09,378 --> 01:21:11,502
every curve.

616
01:21:14,749 --> 01:21:17,602
I came across time for you, Sarah.

617
01:21:18,637 --> 01:21:23,158
I love you. I always have.

618
01:21:40,876 --> 01:21:42,677
I shouldn't have said that.

619
01:23:13,618 --> 01:23:15,785
Think fast!

620
01:24:44,889 --> 01:24:46,590
Trade places!

621
01:24:57,319 --> 01:25:00,772
Faster! Drive faster!

622
01:25:50,321 --> 01:25:51,855
Kyle!

623
01:25:52,522 --> 01:25:54,157
Oh, my God!

624
01:26:27,876 --> 01:26:29,510
Kyle.

625
01:26:43,807 --> 01:26:45,759
- Whoa!
- Son of a bitch!

626
01:27:01,191 --> 01:27:02,959
You stay here.

627
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,334
Let's get out of here.

628
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:33,105
Get out.

629
01:27:49,657 --> 01:27:52,909
Kyle. Come on, get up.

630
01:27:59,048 --> 01:28:00,961
He's coming.

631
01:28:00,987 --> 01:28:03,852
Kyle? Come on!

632
01:28:04,953 --> 01:28:08,410
Help me! Get out! Get out!

633
01:28:08,736 --> 01:28:10,308
Get out!

634
01:28:19,568 --> 01:28:21,152
Come on!

635
01:28:27,209 --> 01:28:29,060
Faster!

636
01:28:32,464 --> 01:28:34,949
Don't stop! Run!

637
01:30:46,614 --> 01:30:48,548
Sarah!

638
01:30:49,016 --> 01:30:50,666
Kyle!

639
01:30:55,623 --> 01:30:59,092
Oh, Kyle. Kyle.

640
01:31:00,328 --> 01:31:03,513
We did it, Kyle. We got it.

641
01:31:23,117 --> 01:31:24,668
No!

642
01:31:24,736 --> 01:31:26,670
No!

643
01:32:21,858 --> 01:32:23,659
Wait!

644
01:32:28,031 --> 01:32:33,435
- What are you doing?
- Cover, so he can't track us.

645
01:32:43,362 --> 01:32:48,200
Come on! Come on. No, Kyle!

646
01:32:49,336 --> 01:32:53,289
- Come on! Come on!
- Leave me here.

647
01:32:53,290 --> 01:32:54,891
Get up!

648
01:33:04,099 --> 01:33:09,070
Move it, Reese!
On your feet, soldier!

649
01:33:09,137 --> 01:33:12,691
On your feet! Move it!

650
01:34:24,246 --> 01:34:26,346
Back. Go back.

651
01:35:00,432 --> 01:35:02,700
- Run, Sarah.
- No.

652
01:35:02,768 --> 01:35:04,302
Run!

653
01:35:07,772 --> 01:35:09,340
Run!

654
01:35:09,607 --> 01:35:11,692
Come on, motherfucker.

655
01:37:04,604 --> 01:37:06,888
No, no.

656
01:39:04,921 --> 01:39:07,189
You're terminated, fucker.

657
01:40:04,780 --> 01:40:06,349
Kyle.

658
01:40:08,453 --> 01:40:14,406
<i>6450 Bellingham Avenue, Super
Trader. 6450 Bellingham Avenue.</i>

659
01:40:27,287 --> 01:40:31,122
Tape 7, November 10. Where was I?

660
01:40:32,090 --> 01:40:36,395
What's most difficult for me is trying to
decide what to tell you and what not to.

661
01:40:36,663 --> 01:40:38,877
But I guess I have a
while yet before you're

662
01:40:38,889 --> 01:40:41,017
old enough to even
understand these tapes.

663
01:40:41,085 --> 01:40:45,222
They're more for me at this point,
just so that I can get it straight.

664
01:41:15,668 --> 01:41:19,104
<i>- Gasolina, por favor.
- ¿Cuánto?</i>

665
01:41:19,572 --> 01:41:23,675
<i>- Llena El tanque.</i>
- Fill her up, <i>sí.</i>

666
01:41:27,312 --> 01:41:32,485
Should I tell you about your
father? Boy, that's a tough one.

667
01:41:33,786 --> 01:41:38,624
Will it affect your decision to send him
here, knowing that he is your father?

668
01:41:40,392 --> 01:41:43,091
If you don't send Kyle,
you can never be.

669
01:41:43,095 --> 01:41:46,964
God, a person could go
crazy thinking about this.

670
01:41:50,236 --> 01:41:55,806
I suppose I will tell you.
I owe him that.

671
01:41:58,109 --> 01:42:00,646
Maybe it'll help if...

672
01:42:00,713 --> 01:42:05,651
You know that in the few
hours that we had together...

673
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:10,289
We loved a lifetime's worth.

674
01:42:13,926 --> 01:42:17,245
<i>Usted es muy hermosa, señora,
y tengo Pena decirle</i>

675
01:42:17,246 --> 01:42:22,616
<i>Que me de cinco dolares americanos,
pero Si no, mi padre me Va a pegar.</i>

676
01:42:23,150 --> 01:42:27,087
- What did he just say?
- He says you're very beautiful, señora...

677
01:42:27,155 --> 01:42:30,525
and he's ashamed to ask you for five
American dollars for his picture,

678
01:42:30,526 --> 01:42:33,395
but if he doesn't, his
father will beat him.

679
01:42:33,563 --> 01:42:35,597
Pretty good hustle, kid.

680
01:42:36,565 --> 01:42:39,333
<i>- Cuatro.
- Sí, sí.</i>

681
01:42:40,301 --> 01:42:41,702
<i>Gracias.</i>

682
01:42:43,204 --> 01:42:45,205
<i>¡Miren, miren!</i>

683
01:42:47,158 --> 01:42:50,344
<i>¡Allá! ¡Viene una tormenta!</i>

684
01:42:52,579 --> 01:42:54,549
What did he just say?

685
01:42:55,017 --> 01:42:57,669
He said there's a storm coming in.

686
01:43:01,606 --> 01:43:03,273
I know.
