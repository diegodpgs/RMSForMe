2
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,700
- You think he sees us?
- No, he can't see us.

3
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,500
But trust me, he can feel us watching.

4
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,600
Pop? Oh, that's a big one, Pop.
That's a big one here.

5
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,300
Okay.

6
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,000
He showed up.

7
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,700
Ten-two. Come on, kid, you can do it.

8
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,100
He's circling that little alcove
right there.

9
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,200
This is all you, Kale. That's it.

10
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,300
Try to put it right in front of him.
Right in front of him.

11
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,100
See, you're talking to me,
and you're messing me up, Dad.

12
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,900
Okay. Don't spook him.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,200
- Come on. There.
- There we go.

14
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,300
Oh, that was perfect.

15
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,200
Oh, he's taking it.
Look, he's following it.

16
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,100
Easy. Easy.

17
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,100
Dead drift. Dead drift.

18
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,200
- Oh, you gotta be kidding.
- Easy. Easy. Come on, baby, take it.

19
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,900
- Take it, baby.
- Bite, bite, bite!

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,700
- He bit, he bit!
- Okay, easy.

21
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,100
- That's it. Tip up. Tip up.
- Okay, okay.

22
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,300
Do I let go? Do I let the line go?

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,200
No, don't panic. Just let him take it.
If he wants to take it, let him take it.

24
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,800
- Tip up. That's it.
- He got it. He's biting.

25
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,500
I know. No, he's got it, baby. Come on.

26
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,800
Okay, reel him in slow. Nice and slow.
Hold him.

27
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,100
All right. All right.

28
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,100
- You gotta be kidding me.
- That's all right.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,200
It's okay. You did everything you could.

30
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,700
- This is ridiculous.
- Yeah, no, it's fine.

31
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,500
You did everything you could.
Sometimes they just get away.

32
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,300
Come on, let's take a break.
Come on, it's all right.

33
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,300
If I can't catch a fish,
I don't know what I'm doing out here.

34
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,300
- Beats working, right?
- What?

35
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,200
Hold that. I said, it beats working.

36
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,900
You're a writer. You work from home.
You ain't got it that tough, come on.

37
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,500
- Here you go. You got it?
- Yeah.

38
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,800
You know what?

39
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,400
I really appreciate you bailing
on your friends

40
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,100
to spend some time with your old man.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,200
It's not like you forced me
to be here, Pop.

42
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,900
- No, I know, but I appreciate it.
- I appreciate it.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,600
Anything you want to talk about?
Anything...

44
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,300
- What? What?
- No, it's just...

45
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,700
- Is this that moment? This is that...
- Never mind.

46
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
- No, no, this is that father-son...
- No, never...

47
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,300
- No, I'm in.
- Forget I said it.

48
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,400
I got something. Here's something.
You got a keen eye for this.

49
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,400
- You're not gonna tell Mom?
- No, I won't say anything.

50
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,400
No? All right. I'm having a kid.

51
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,100
Yeah. You know,
your little boy's growing up.

52
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,000
I got a girl pregnant,
and now I gotta go visit her.

53
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,800
She lives in Reno.
I don't know how I'm gonna get there.

54
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,500
I'll probably have to take Mom's car.

55
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,100
But we're gonna live together.
We're gonna move into a trailer park.

56
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,600
Yeah, her name's Shirley.
She's real great.

57
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,100
- Yeah? She cute?
- Of course.

58
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,300
Yeah. Good. That's all that counts.
Smart-ass. Let's fish.

59
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,800
I'm gonna catch one before you.

60
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,800
Yeah, but I don't mess with you
while you're fishing. That's the deal.

61
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,700
No, Ma, we drained the entire...

62
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Literally every fish that was swimming
in the river is now in the trunk right now.

63
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,700
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm not kidding.

64
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,000
Yeah, are you sure you two aren't
stopping off and buying a fish,

65
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,400
like you did last time?

66
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,500
What?

67
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Are we gonna stop off and buy fish,
like the last time?

68
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,000
No, no. Ma, come on.
We know you're too savvy for that.

69
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,700
Oh, come on, look at this guy.

70
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,400
Oh, come on! Jackass!

71
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,000
- Hey.
- No, no, no. No, not you, Mom.

72
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,400
- I'm sorry.
- Give me the phone.

73
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,100
Hey, babe,
you should have seen him today.

74
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,400
We got enough fish for a week.

75
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,400
- How long do you think you'll be?
- I don't know. About an hour?

76
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,500
Forty-five...

77
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Kale!

78
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,300
Kale!

79
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,300
Oh, God.

80
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,300
Oh, God.

81
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,400
Kale, are you okay?

82
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,400
Dad.

83
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,200
Kale!

84
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,200
Dad?

85
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,300
Move it!

86
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,900
Yeah, keep dreaming, perv.

87
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,700
Ronnie!

88
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,200
Señor Brecht?

89
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,900
Kale.

90
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,600
So, Kale,

91
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,000
think you can stay conscious
long enough to tell us

92
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,900
your plans for the three wondrous

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,700
summer months ahead?

94
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,800
Do you want me to stand up?

95
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,700
Summer months.

96
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,500
I don't know what you just said.
I didn't read that far in the book.

97
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,900
Did you do the homework or not?

98
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,700
I guess not.

99
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,300
You guess not?

100
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,800
I don't know who you think you are,

101
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,000
or who you think you're dealing with.

102
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,900
You can't give me
a straight answer, fine.

103
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,000
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't fail you

104
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,800
right now.

105
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,800
What would your father think?

106
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,600
No, Kale! No, no, no!

107
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,400
Okay, Mr. Brecht.

108
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,200
You're six months shy of 18.

109
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,300
That means the Assault Two charge
you've pled guilty to carries a maximum

110
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,200
of one year in juvie.

111
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,500
With these priors, you're up to three.

112
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,000
Losing a parent isn't easy,

113
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,800
which is why I'm sentencing you
to three months house arrest.

114
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,200
Mr. Brecht, I just cut you a break.

115
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,200
Don't test me.

116
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,000
Okay, you're all set to go nowhere.

117
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,600
Now, green means you're good,
you're in the safe zone,

118
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,900
which covers about
a 100-foot radius from this guy.

119
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,100
You unplug it,
the police come immediately.

120
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
He's like a modem.

121
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,000
He gets a constant GPS signal
from Mr. Bracelet

122
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,600
that goes through your phone line
to the monitoring systems downtown.

123
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,200
So they know where you are,
where you've been

124
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,800
and what you're thinking, 25/7.

125
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,900
- What if he accidentally goes beyond...
- Red light flashes.

126
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,900
You got 10 seconds
to get your butt back to green, or else.

127
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,800
Or else what?
The execution squad shows up?

128
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,000
And they don't bring blindfolds.

129
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,500
It's tamper-proof and waterproof.

130
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,300
So don't try to stick your foot in a bucket
of water and hop across the line.

131
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,400
It won't work, and you'll look stupid.

132
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,800
Now, here's the instructions.
Here's my card.

133
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,900
Thank you.

134
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,800
Are you all set up to pay
the incarceration fee, Mrs. Brecht?

135
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,500
- No.
- $12. Every day.

136
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,900
I accept all major credit cards.

137
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,200
Great.

138
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,000
My wallet's right over here.

139
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,000
Officer.

140
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,200
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Brecht.
- Thank you, really.

141
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,900
Gutierrez?

142
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,000
Your Spanish teacher,

143
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,100
he's my cousin.

144
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,800
Oh, one more thing. Listen up.

145
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,900
House arrest might sound like a breeze,

146
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,800
but I've seen many a folk get a bit loopy
after too long.

147
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,700
Some after just a day or two.

148
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,400
So find constructive things to do
to keep yourself busy.

149
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Boom! Nice shot.

150
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,900
Okay, get my left flank.
There's two more at the entrance.

151
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,500
Let me jump on the M60.
Cobra's at 3 o'clock.

152
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
- Just get your position and hold it.
- Do it now, man!

153
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,700
Just get your position and hold it.
Go down to the bottom entrance.

154
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,500
Okay, here we go.
Here it comes, here it comes.

155
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,000
- Just watch. Here it goes.
- Shoot, now!

156
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,800
- Fired.
- Come on!

157
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,700
Boom! Boom! Got it.
Okay, we got that. We got that.

158
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,400
Now, follow me. Off the ledge.
There's a secret entrance at the bottom.

159
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,100
Hello?

160
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,900
You gotta be kidding me. Hello?

161
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,900
Alan stops by Cheaters to discuss
what's been eating at his conscience.

162
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,300
Well, your camera busted in
on the situation that I guess I was in.

163
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,600
Uh-oh.

164
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Here she comes.

165
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,700
Hey! Where you going?

166
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,900
Caught you, bro.

167
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,900
Here. Come around here.

168
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,100
What the... is going on?

169
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,700
- Alan?
- Come on.

170
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,000
Man up, Alan.

171
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,100
- Open the... door.
- Alan?

172
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,400
- What the...
- What the hell you doing?

173
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,500
What the...

174
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,000
Explain what you're doing
with Valerie's cousin?

175
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,600
How the hell... How the...

176
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,800
... Saint Tropez all the way to Cannes.

177
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,300
It was so beautiful. There's nothing
like it, especially from the air.

178
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,300
Parasail with us through the skies
over endless blue water.

179
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,600
Then shop Cabo's maze of streets,
alleyway stores and curios.

180
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,700
Then we'll get adventurous
with the best in water sports.

181
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,500
And, of course, the good stuff,
chicas calientes.

182
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,400
On Bikini Destinations,
Cabo San Lucas.

183
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,200
Police in Madison...

184
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,100
- More trash TV?
- No, it's news.

185
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,900
... 15 miles west of Springdale
have released the first photo

186
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,700
of 33-year-old Patricia Williams,

187
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,300
who may be the victim of a kidnapping.

188
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,700
Family members reported Williams
missing yesterday

189
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,100
after repeated calls to her cell phone
went unanswered for three days.

190
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,800
You canceled my Xbox.

191
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,400
iTunes, too.

192
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,300
You know what else I'm canceling?

193
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,000
Maid service.

194
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,800
Look, Kale, I'm sorry you're a felon,
but this is not a vacation.

195
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,400
I have two open houses today.

196
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,500
I want you to clean up this room
and clean up the kitchen.

197
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,500
I'll do that.
Let me just check my schedule.

198
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,100
If you have any information
on the whereabouts

199
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,400
of Patricia Williams,
a special hotline number

200
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,000
has been set up at 1-800...

201
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,500
Isn't that a little overdramatic?

202
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,700
You don't think
I'm just gonna plug it back in?

203
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,100
Dramatic?

204
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,800
What are you gonna do now?

205
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,800
Are you crazy?

206
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,800
- Ma...
- That's dramatic.

207
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,800
Clean up your room.

208
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,200
Ronnie, you have no idea
how much this thing itches.

209
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,600
Plus, my mother transformed.
She's a dictator now,

210
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,200
like the warden from Shawshank.
And she took my Xbox.

211
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,000
And my iTunes are gone, right?
And I can't go anywhere.

212
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,700
I'm losing it. I'm losing my mind.
Just give me any information,

213
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,200
anything at all.
What's going on out there?

214
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,900
You gotta see these Oahu chicks.
The natives are ferocious.

215
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,100
This girl down by the pool,

216
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,800
she just taught me how
to say "Lauhala-lana."

217
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,600
- What does that mean?
- I have no idea.

218
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,400
- I think it's a Hawaiian mating call.
- You're lying.

219
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,500
Who's that with you? Is that...

220
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,700
Do you work here?
I'm gonna have to call you back, okay?

221
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,100
No, no, don't do it. Ronnie. Ronnie.

222
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,300
- Ronnie! Ronnie!
- I've gotta go, bye.

223
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:47,000
Oh, yeah. Here we go.

224
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,600
Oh, yeah, there we go. Yeah.

225
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,100
Mary asked if I'd cover the hostess
stand a couple nights this week.

226
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,300
So, I could be kind of late.

227
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,300
Do you want to talk about anything?

228
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,300
I got nothing.

229
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,700
- I'm dropping this off in the garage.
- Oh, careful. Careful.

230
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,400
It's a priceless family heirloom.
I don't have time to explain it.

231
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,200
Put it downstairs.

232
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,600
Get the boxes out first.

233
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Ashley, sweetie,
could you please come upstairs?

234
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,100
- Be nice to your mom today, okay?
- I am being very nice.

235
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,300
And we've got more stuff in the car,
so, you know, join in.

236
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,400
Yeah, I'm coming!

237
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,500
God.

238
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,000
Yeah?

239
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,200
Oh! Oh, shit.

240
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
No!

241
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,600
It's dog shit.

242
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,600
What a retard!

243
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,400
You little bastards.

244
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,400
Bet you think that's real funny, huh?

245
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,400
What are you gonna do?
Kill us, like you killed your teacher?

246
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,800
Not before I shove this shit and my foot
back up your asses.

247
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,300
Oh, crap!

248
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,500
Dude, you said
he couldn't leave his house.

249
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,000
He can't!

250
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,300
Oh, shit.

251
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,600
Oh, shit. Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit!

252
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,000
Turn green! Turn green!

253
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,400
Okay, here we are, back at home.
I'm good.

254
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,900
Turn green. Come on.

255
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,100
Come on! Turn green, I'm in!

256
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,400
Turn green. Come on.

257
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,900
Yes!

258
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,300
Yes! Yes!

259
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,700
Hey, are you okay?

260
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,800
No, it's fine.

261
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,100
I'm fine. It just... It turned. I'm green.

262
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,200
No, no, no. Sir? Listen.
Officer, listen to me.

263
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,400
I wasn't trying to go anywhere.
I wasn't trying to leave.

264
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,000
There's a bag of shit on my stairs.
Two kids just...

265
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,800
Honestly, they put a bag of shit
on my stairs and they lit it on fire.

266
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,600
- Get down on the ground.
- There's a bag of shit on my...

267
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,600
Get down on the ground!

268
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,700
Get your hands behind your head.

269
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,600
Somebody comes
and shits on my house?

270
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,700
- Face down, face down.
- This is bullshit.

271
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,100
Now give me your other hand.

272
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,800
Kale, calm down. The officers were
probably in the neighborhood already.

273
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,000
Yeah, but the cop that came,
that cop is my teacher's cousin.

274
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,000
They're related.
Isn't that a conflict of interest?

275
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,300
- Is there no other cops that can...
- He didn't haul you away, right?

276
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,000
- No. No, he didn't. He...
- Because first times happen.

277
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,600
- Right.
- The officers knew that.

278
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,900
Even your teacher's cousin.

279
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,200
But next time you will be back
in front of a judge, all right?

280
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,800
Thank you.

281
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,300
Little harder, Chad.

282
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,000
Hi, pup.

283
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,900
Come here.

284
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,400
- You and me, both.
- Frankie! Frankie!

285
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,600
- Where is he? Where is he?
- No, no, no.

286
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,900
Frankie! Where are you?

287
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,900
Frankie!

288
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,600
- Mom?
- What'd you get?

289
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,500
Just a couple things.

290
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,900
You want to try them on for me?

291
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,900
- Maybe later.
- Well, the pool's almost ready.

292
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,400
Aloha, Señor Kale.

293
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:02,000
Ronald! What's going on, bro?

294
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,900
- Nothing.
- How you doing?

295
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,700
- Oh, great. Have you been showering?
- Of course. Come on.

296
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,000
- What is that?
- Macadamia nuts.

297
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,900
That's all you got me?
Some stupid nuts?

298
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,800
Hey, I got something to show you
that is most definitely...

299
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,100
No, no. I got something to show you.
I got something to show you.

300
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,700
This is reality without the TV.

301
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
There's a world
right outside my window.

302
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,900
- Look, look. Here we go.
- I have Maui chicks, man.

303
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,100
There it is. Mrs. Pilch.

304
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,800
And the Pilch dog.

305
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,900
- Exciting.
- No, no, no, wait, it's not done.

306
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,400
Look, and then she...
Look what she does.

307
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,000
She says bye to Linda,
the maid they have at the house,

308
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,600
who has a titty tat, you know.

309
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,500
And then every Thursday at 4:00,
she goes to the country club

310
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,600
and plays tennis
with Betty Big-Bangs over there.

311
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,500
Okay, and then the ladies leave.

312
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,300
Here we go. Cue Mr. Pilch,
coming back from work.

313
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,800
- Fascinating.
- Here we go, here we go.

314
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,900
Get up. Get up and look at this.
What do you think that's about, huh?

315
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,700
He comes in. Here, take this.
Take this. Take it.

316
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,700
Put that down. Look.
Look at the top, second story.

317
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,400
- Who's there?
- Damn!

318
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,500
Right? You see what I'm saying?
Here, come on.

319
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,600
- Ronnie, let's go.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.

320
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,700
Oh, my God, you've made
the Tower of Twinkie.

321
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,700
Is that in the Stalker's Handbook
somewhere?

322
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,300
No, listen. That's not what I am, okay?
I'm not a stalker.

323
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,800
These are just simple observations.
Natural side effects of chronic boredom.

324
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,400
Find your passion, Kale.

325
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,900
This is Robert Turner.

326
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,100
And...

327
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,600
He does that about twice a day.
Other than that, I don't really see him.

328
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,300
Here's the little shitbagger sleeper cell
I was telling you about, remember?

329
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,200
- Oh, the ding-dong ditch?
- Yeah, that's them.

330
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,500
So what's the plan
for the counterattack?

331
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,100
I don't know.
I'm keeping my options open.

332
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,500
- The runt is mine.
- Here, come on.

333
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,700
- What was that?
- Here, come on.

334
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,600
Last stop on the tour.

335
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,600
Here, come here. Come here.

336
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,400
Oh, my God.

337
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,700
There is a God.

338
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,800
Yeah.

339
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,300
Who is she?

340
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,200
I don't know.

341
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,100
What's stopping you?

342
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,600
Come on.

343
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,100
Shit. Oh, God.

344
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,900
Can I help you?

345
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,500
No, no, no. I'm fine, I got it. I got it.

346
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,100
I'm real close.
It's just the bush has grown a little bit.

347
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,100
Don't worry about it.
I do this all the time.

348
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,800
Yeah, I can tell.

349
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,800
I got these two.

350
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,900
A little embarrassing,
I can't get my own mail.

351
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,900
I think any pride you had left
was gone a while ago.

352
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,100
Oh, you mean when the cops came.

353
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,200
No, no, no.
That was a screw-up on their end.

354
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,700
That wasn't me.
Wrong guy, wrong house, wrong...

355
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,700
Wrong. Just wrong.
I'm Kale, by the way.

356
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,400
So, how's your move going?

357
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,300
- Still going.
- Yeah?

358
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,100
I'd help. I'm just a little
spatially challenged at the moment.

359
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,700
Yeah, you kinda got that whole
Martha Stewart thing going on.

360
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,200
Yeah, kinda. Except I don't get, like,

361
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,500
a 48-hour allowance for office visits.

362
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,600
I'm not very good
at decorating pastries, either.

363
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,200
It's not one of my strong suits.

364
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,900
So, where'd you say you moved from?

365
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,100
- I'm from the city.
- The city?

366
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,400
And now, forcefully relocated.

367
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,000
Ashley?

368
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,300
Can you come in here, please?

369
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,900
My mom.

370
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,200
Yeah, I've been washing dishes
by hand.

371
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,100
She's really polite
and always says "please,"

372
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,900
but she has that tone, did you notice?

373
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,800
Yeah, I know the tone.

374
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,100
I'm Ashley, by the way.

375
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,800
Noticed that, too.

376
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,000
Japan's earning season will
go into full swing this week, so...

377
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,200
... weeks ago.

378
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,800
A valet parking attendant says
an unidentified person

379
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,700
picked up Williams sometime
between 10:00 and 10:30 p.m.

380
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,100
That individual was driving
a blue 1960s Ford Mustang,

381
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,900
which may have been dented
on the left side.

382
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,400
Police have released
a surveillance tape

383
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,500
confirming the eyewitness account.

384
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,200
But now, in the newest development,

385
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:48,600
sources close to the investigation say
a review of the entire tape...

386
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,800
Started without me, huh?

387
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,200
Nice.

388
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,500
What are you stopping for?

389
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,100
No.

390
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,300
You can't see me. It's too dark in here.

391
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,700
All right, you've done it.
You've pushed me right over the edge.

392
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,300
Just look at me when I talk to you!
Now, listen...

393
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,800
You've let me down, Ashley!

394
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,900
A Mustang.

395
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,700
- Oh, Jesus.
- Jesus.

396
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,700
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I thought you heard me. I'm sorry.

397
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,000
That's fine. It's fine.
I didn't hear you. You're like a ninja.

398
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,600
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

399
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,500
What are you doing?

400
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,300
Just staring out the window.
Staring at the wind. You know,

401
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,800
getting creative.

402
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,700
Well, I just wanted to say good night.

403
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,100
- Well, good night. I love you.
- Okay.

404
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,400
- I love you.
- Okay. Sleep good.

405
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,500
Jesus, Ma.

406
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,100
Hey.

407
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,100
What are you doing?

408
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,300
What are you doing?

409
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,000
Looking at my garden? Is that it?

410
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,400
You looking at my beautiful garden?

411
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,400
Well, I caught you now.

412
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,600
I got you.

413
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,600
Yeah, you're not gonna
dig in my garden anymore.

414
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,900
Nothing about missing bunnies,
but listen to this.

415
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,500
Now the cops are saying
that the circumstances surrounding

416
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,200
the girl's disappearance are similar

417
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,800
to several murder-kidnappings
in Austin three years ago.

418
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,800
All redheads.

419
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,700
They didn't catch the guy,

420
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,600
but they found seven chicks' bodies
in a house

421
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,300
a year after the alleged killer
abandoned the property.

422
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,900
No leads, no way of IDing
whoever lived there,

423
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,500
'cause he used a fake name,
and probably a PO box,

424
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,100
'cause no mail was ever delivered
to the house.

425
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,300
Hello.

426
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,700
Oh, here, check this. They got pictures.

427
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,800
- Wow, that is sick.
- Hello.

428
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,200
- Yo, you gotta see this. Check this...
- Movement.

429
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,500
- We're going swimming.
- Okay.

430
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,000
What do we have?

431
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,800
Well, better late than never, right?

432
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,800
Here we go. Here we go.

433
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,200
I really, really like your neighborhood.

434
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,500
- Well, that's new.
- We like new.

435
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,500
It's so warm, baby.

436
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,900
Okay, that's it. Cleansing breath. Can I?

437
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,000
- Yeah.
- Okay.

438
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,100
There we go.

439
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,100
Okay, girl, you concentrate now.
This is for the gold.

440
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,900
Oh, God!

441
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,400
You're a jackass.
You are a genuine jackass.

442
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,700
Seriously,
there's no way she heard that.

443
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,100
I promise you, she heard it.
My deaf aunt in Omaha heard.

444
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
Oh, no!

445
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,200
- What?
- She just saw me. She saw me.

446
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,300
- What?
- Yeah, she saw me.

447
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,500
- She was looking up at me when...
- No.

448
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,600
- No, no.
- Yeah, she saw me.

449
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,100
There's no way she... See? She's...

450
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,600
Okay, maybe she did.

451
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,900
Really?

452
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,600
Well, are her swims always that short?

453
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:16,900
No, she usually takes her time with it.
That's what I'm telling you.

454
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,300
Oh, God. And now she's gone.

455
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,200
- No!
- No!

456
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,600
It's nothing. It's not her.

457
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,100
Well, listen, it could be her.

458
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,300
- It's not, so...
- Okay, we'll check. We'll check.

459
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,600
Well, no, no, I'm saying, if it's not her,
then you can let them go away.

460
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,600
It's her at the door. It's her at the door.

461
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,800
- No! No, no, no.
- Just look, look.

462
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:47,600
- Shit! Don't, don't...
- Okay, okay, okay. Stop it. Okay.

463
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,900
- Wait, wait, I got it.
- Oh, my God, we are so busted.

464
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,400
- No, no, no! Wait! Don't answer it!
- I have to.

465
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,500
She knows I'm here.
I got the thing on my foot.

466
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,700
Hi.

467
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,600
What took you so long?

468
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,600
What... We were...
We were upstairs playing.

469
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,200
- Video games!
- Yeah. Video games.

470
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,000
This is my friend, Ronnie. Ronald.

471
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,400
- Say hi, Ronald.
- Hi, Ronald.

472
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,300
You're so stupid.

473
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,900
So, what brings you here?
To my house?

474
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,400
- I got locked out.
- Oh, that sucks.

475
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,000
It's a tragedy.

476
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,700
So, you gotta call someone?

477
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,300
No, I'd rather stay stranded,
if you don't mind.

478
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,500
Video games, huh? I like to play.

479
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,300
Is this your room?

480
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,400
Just so you know,
it's a little messy, okay?

481
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,900
- A little?
- Yeah.

482
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,000
Anything interesting out here?

483
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,300
The...

484
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,900
Okay.

485
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,100
I'm sorry, what did you say?
I didn't hear you. I didn't hear you.

486
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,900
Are you spying on the neighbors, Kale?

487
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,000
Actually, he is.

488
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,200
You see, he's got this neighbor,

489
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,700
who I guess, by definition,
would also be your neighbor.

490
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,900
Who may, in point of fact,

491
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,300
- be a cold-blooded killer...
- Right.

492
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,500
...from Texas.
- Right. Well, he's from Austin.

493
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,400
- Yeah.
- Is that so?

494
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,700
- Yeah. Yeah, that's...
- Exhibit A. Robert Turner.

495
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,200
Yeah.

496
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,300
Yeah, I've seen him. So?

497
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,800
- So?
- So...

498
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,300
Well, so, the missing girl's
from Madison?

499
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,500
On the news.

500
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,400
You think he has something
to do with that?

501
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,000
He drives a car
just like the one she was

502
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,300
- last seen in.
- Which is a '60s-era Mustang.

503
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,400
A '60s-era Mustang.

504
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,500
- Same color. Yeah.
- And it's the same color.

505
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,400
Gee, that really narrows it down.

506
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,700
Well, you know,
the news said that car was dented.

507
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,300
- Yeah, and his front fender's dented.
- Yeah.

508
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,800
- Right?
- It's cohesive.

509
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,400
- It matches. The whole story.
- Yeah.

510
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,700
It fits.

511
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,400
Okay.

512
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,900
I am seeing the Mustang.

513
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
But no bashed-in fender.

514
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,400
What? Yeah, no, it's there. It's there.

515
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:16,000
If I could just... It should be there.

516
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,800
That's weird.
How'd he get it fixed so fast?

517
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,200
Maybe 'cause it was never there
in the first place.

518
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
However, he is clearly a pack rat.

519
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,800
He plays volleyball.

520
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,300
- He collects skulls!
- What? Here, let me see.

521
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,500
That's a longhorn skull.

522
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,900
You know what state's famous
for longhorns.

523
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,500
- Texas.
- And what state's the killer from?

524
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,900
Texas.

525
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,700
Fine. Where's the coffee and donuts?

526
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,800
You can't have a stakeout
without coffee and donuts.

527
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,600
That's everything I could find.

528
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:07,200
Got most of it off of my uncle.
He's a type-A sociopath.

529
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,700
How long has Turner lived there?

530
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,800
I don't know. A few years.

531
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,900
Hey, check this out.

532
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,100
The victims they found in Texas
were preserved,

533
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,300
delaying their decomposition.

534
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,200
This guy was so sick.

535
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,700
They say their bodies were twisted
and jammed into the basement walls.

536
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,400
This girl died from blunt trauma,
most likely blows to the head and face.

537
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,200
Gnarly. I'm hungry.

538
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,900
Let's order pizza.

539
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,000
He's been gone a while.

540
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,200
Here.

541
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,100
How'd you get my phone?

542
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,000
That's a big violation of privacy,
you know.

543
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,800
This is... I could turn you in for this.

544
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,400
What did you do?
I know you did something.

545
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,900
Every time he calls you,

546
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,800
that's what you'll hear.

547
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,000
Okay. That's a nice choice.

548
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,100
Cute.

549
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,300
It's a little scary, though, right?

550
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,100
It could use a little color. Do you mind?

551
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,200
No. Go for it, Picasso.

552
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:20,200
So, why'd your parents drag you
to the 'burbs, anyway?

553
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,500
Well, I guess my mom wanted
to keep my dad on a shorter leash.

554
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,300
City life had its temptations.

555
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,300
But my mom pretty much cries
just as much as she always did,

556
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,000
and my dad doesn't care
more than ever.

557
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,100
What'd they think,
the extra bathroom would help?

558
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,400
Maybe a two-car garage.

559
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,500
"You know what, honey?
Infidelity, forget about it.

560
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,200
"Look at the storage space!"

561
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,100
Something like that.

562
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,500
So, what are your issues, Kale?

563
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,200
What makes you think I have issues?

564
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,900
Gee, I don't know.

565
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,400
Look, there he is.

566
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,000
It's another car.

567
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,900
Who said chivalry's dead?

568
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,600
I didn't.

569
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,900
- There's a club girl for you.
- How can you tell?

570
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,500
The bright green bracelet
is from The Place.

571
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,300
The red one is from The Komodo Club,
and yellow is from Razors.

572
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,100
Jesus. You must have a great ID, huh?

573
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,000
I don't need one.

574
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,100
I love her shoes.

575
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,900
You gotta be joking.

576
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,200
Is that what you're looking at? Shoes.

577
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,600
Of course.

578
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,000
He's going in.

579
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,100
He's gonna get her all liquored up.

580
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,100
This feels wrong.

581
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,700
Oh, he's going for it.

582
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,400
Okay.

583
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,900
Here he goes. Here he goes.

584
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,400
Denied.

585
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,600
Look at the look on his face.

586
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,900
A little music to set the mood.

587
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,100
- What do you think they're listening to?
- I don't know.

588
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,100
You know what? I got an idea.
Here, take this.

589
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,500
- No.
- No?

590
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:44,100
No. Stop, stop.

591
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,000
- No.
- Yeah.

592
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,000
- You're kidding me.
- I think we got a match.

593
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,400
Oh, God.

594
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,400
It does match.

595
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,400
Only in Disturbia.

596
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,700
Where else are you gonna get
this kind of entertainment?

597
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:03,100
- Thank God you moved here, right?
- Yeah.

598
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,300
Wait a minute.

599
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,800
Wait, did you see that?
Wait, zoom in a little.

600
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,900
Oh, my God.

601
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,500
Did you see that? The price tag.

602
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,000
She won't be returning that dress.

603
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:00,000
Oh, there you go.
Now you should bust your move.

604
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,200
Who's the redhead?

605
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,300
- She's cute.
- Don't you have something to do?

606
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,800
Don't you have something to do?

607
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,300
- No.
- Your...

608
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:18,200
Yeah. My dad likes this song,
by the way.

609
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,600
Hi, Mom.

610
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,700
- Here we go.
- No, I'm fine.

611
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,600
I'm at Barnes & Noble.

612
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,300
No, that's okay, I'll walk.

613
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,700
Shift's over. Gotta go.

614
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,700
Walk me?

615
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,100
Sure.

616
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,100
Give this to your mom.

617
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,800
Thank you for an interesting night
and day.

618
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,700
I guess this is as far as you go.

619
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,600
I guess so.

620
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,200
So, same shift tomorrow?

621
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,400
I'll get back to you.

622
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,100
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

623
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,400
Somebody, anybody.

624
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,300
Somebody, anybody.

625
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,900
Come on, baby.

626
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,800
Hello, boys.

627
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,000
Family fun night.

628
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,200
Okay. I see what's going on.

629
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,600
Oh, Jesus. You guys are screwed now.

630
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,100
"We're just watching cartoons."

631
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:38,600
"Oh, okay, sweetie. I understand.
You guys are growing boys."

632
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,300
Come on, Mom.

633
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,400
Bastards. Wow, they are horny as shit.

634
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:54,200
Help! Help!

635
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,700
Shit, come on.

636
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,400
Oh, shit.

637
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,700
Okay. Oh, God.

638
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,700
- Ronnie.
- How far did you get?

639
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,200
Ronnie, listen to me. Okay.
Turner just saw me.

640
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,400
- What?
- Yeah.

641
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,700
And the redhead
who was at his house, okay?

642
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,900
- Are you sure?
- He chased her around the house,

643
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,200
and it got dark, he turned the lights out.

644
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:47,700
I mean, I don't know what I saw. I saw...
Well, what if he killed her? I mean...

645
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,100
Slow down, slow down. Talk to me.
What is happening?

646
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,700
- Just stay on the phone.
- Kale?

647
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,900
Okay, just stay on the phone.

648
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,400
Are you seeing something?

649
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,100
Kale, what is happening?

650
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,100
Talk to me, man.

651
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:17,000
It's the redhead.
She's leaving the house.

652
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,600
You are seriously losing it,
you know that?

653
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,400
You gotta stop this, all right, Kale?

654
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,800
Kale?

655
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,600
- No!
- No, no, no! Whoa.

656
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,700
Whoa. Just take it easy.

657
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,300
Easy. Slow down.

658
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,500
I'm Robert Turner. I'm your neighbor.
I just live behind you...

659
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,900
Yeah, I know who you are!
What are you doing in my house?

660
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
- Well, I...
- Morning, honey!

661
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,500
I think I startled him.

662
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:29,300
I ran into Robert at the grocery store.
I had a flat tire when I came out.

663
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,200
We tried to change it,
but that adaptor thingamajiggy...

664
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,700
Yeah, my dad put those bolts on.

665
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,000
Well, it did not work.
Instead it stripped it.

666
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,700
- My fault.
- No.

667
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,900
You saved my life.

668
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,800
We had it towed to Frank's.

669
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,900
Oh, yeah?
Thank God you were there, huh?

670
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,100
- To tow it to Frank's.
- Just glad I could help.

671
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,000
Kale, would it kill you
to use a bread knife?

672
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:51,500
It's a knife. What's the difference?

673
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,800
Well, the difference?
About 60 bucks at Bed Bath.

674
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:59,800
Hey, you know, those things...

675
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,100
I've always been curious
about those things.

676
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,400
- Do you mind if I just take a look?
- Yeah, I mind.

677
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,000
- So what'd you do?
- How do you like your coffee?

678
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,200
I popped my Spanish teacher.

679
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:20,400
Shoot, I think I left the milk in the car.
I'll be right back.

680
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,200
So, when you say that you

681
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:40,100
- popped your teacher...
- Yeah, I punched him in the face.

682
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,600
Listen,

683
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,200
I get it.

684
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,700
I went to school.

685
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:54,300
There are plenty of teachers
I wanted to just kill.

686
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,500
Kale, would you grab the sugar, please?

687
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,400
Here it is.

688
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,000
Can I pour you some milk?

689
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,300
On the way back here, your mom was
saying how much she likes eating out.

690
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,600
Was she?

691
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,000
I thought maybe we could do dinner
and a movie sometime...

692
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,600
- That's not gonna happen.
- I would like that. It'd be good.

693
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,700
For me. For me it's not gonna happen.

694
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,800
But I'm sure my mother would love
to go, huh, Ma?

695
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,700
- You'd love that.
- Why don't we sit down?

696
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,700
Nice meeting you, Kale.

697
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:38,100
- He is something.
- Yes, he really is something.

698
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:40,700
And so is your place.

699
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,200
That's creepy.

700
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,500
I said it, I told you.
The guy's a freak show, right?

701
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,500
Did he genuinely mean
it was nice meeting you,

702
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,900
or was he sending you
some kind of sinister message?

703
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:54,200
- Are you playing with me?
- A little.

704
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,500
- Did you even notice my hair?
- Yeah, no, it's nice.

705
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,500
It's real nice. Okay, there's the Mustang.

706
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,600
Then there's the longhorn skull
in his garage.

707
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,000
And then there was the club girl.

708
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,000
Who looked freaked out, okay?
She looked freaked out.

709
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,100
She was running around half-naked
in his living room.

710
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,900
Then he challenges me.
He stares at me.

711
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,300
He shows up in my kitchen,
hits on my mother.

712
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,000
- I mean...
- Can you blame him?

713
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,600
Your mom's hot.

714
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,200
My mom's hot. Can you be serious?

715
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,900
Did you consider whatever look
that girl had

716
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,100
might have been something else?

717
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,100
Maybe she likes being
chased around half-naked.

718
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,300
And that's it?
That's what you're leaving me with?

719
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,900
I'm going to a party.

720
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,600
- Whose?
- Mine.

721
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,800
Yours?

722
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,600
You're having a...
I didn't mean to say it like that.

723
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:41,900
I just didn't know you knew anyone.

724
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,500
I met this girl today, Minnie Tyco.

725
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,000
Minnie... Yes, "Skinny Psycho."
Yeah, I had Spanish with her.

726
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,100
She's a lot of fun.

727
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,500
I told her my parents were going out
of town, and one thing led to another.

728
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,400
She called somebody,
and then they called somebody,

729
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,000
- and now, everybody's coming.
- Yeah, no, I got it, I got it.

730
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,900
So now you got the whole jock
and bimbo population showing up?

731
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,800
Well, that'll be fun.

732
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,700
So you're really going through with this?

733
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:07,900
Yes.

734
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,500
All right, well, that'll be fun.

735
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,900
I just didn't think
you would conform so fast but...

736
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:19,900
Try to keep those
in your drawers tonight, will you?

737
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Wait, what was that?
Oh, you think I'm watching you.

738
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:49,100
Well, I'm not. I'm not watching.
I'm minding my own business.

739
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,900
Hey, how are you?

740
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,900
All right, that's it. That's it!

741
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,300
Oh, my God.

742
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:12,400
- You don't like Minnie Riperton?
- Fire!

743
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:15,500
I hit him, you guys! Go, you guys!
Go, go, go, go!

744
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,600
I got you now, Greenwood!

745
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:21,400
- Oh, my God! Go!
- You better not be listed!

746
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,500
Big tactical error, my friend. Huge!

747
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:34,800
What the...

748
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,300
What are you doing here? Huh?

749
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,600
Oh! No! Wait.

750
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,500
What's wrong?
You don't like my music?

751
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,700
- Oh, my God.
- What?

752
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,800
Oh, shit. Hold on.

753
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,000
Back off, or I will throw this
where you can't follow.

754
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,300
Okay, just relax, okay?
That's 60 gigs of my life.

755
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,800
Even better.

756
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:06,200
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

757
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:07,600
I'm trying to enjoy my party.

758
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,600
- Oh, really? Okay.
- Oh, no, wait.

759
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:12,200
That's wrong.
According to you, I'm trying to conform.

760
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:14,700
- Well, you could have fooled me.
- What does that mean?

761
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,100
I'm saying, if you're trying
to enjoy your party, enjoy your party.

762
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,300
Don't keep looking up at me, trying
to get a rise out of me. It's unnecessary.

763
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,300
So, you were watching me.

764
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,100
But for how long? Just tonight?

765
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:28,700
A week? Two weeks? Since I moved in?

766
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:32,600
What have you been
keeping tabs on, Kale?

767
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,900
What else have you seen?

768
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,300
- What else have I seen?
- Yeah. What else?

769
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,900
I've seen a lot.

770
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,100
I mean, not like that. Not... I mean...

771
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:51,800
For instance, I've seen that you're

772
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:55,700
maybe one of, I don't know,
three people in the world

773
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,200
that likes pizza-flavored chips.

774
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:01,000
You're also the only person
I've ever seen that spends more time

775
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:04,300
on the roof of her house
than in her actual house.

776
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:07,100
And what are you doing?
You're reading.

777
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:11,300
Books. You know, not US Weekly,
or Seventeen or, you know...

778
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:14,100
But you're reading substantial books.

779
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,400
You also do this...

780
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:21,800
You do this thing where,
it's like an OCD thing, but it's not. It's...

781
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,900
Whenever you're leaving your room,
you grab the doorknob, and you turn,

782
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,300
you're getting ready to leave,
but you don't, you stop,

783
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:31,700
and you back up, and you turn
to the mirror, and you stare at yourself.

784
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:35,400
But it's not like a, you know,
"I'm so hot," type of stare.

785
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,900
You know, it's more like,

786
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,400
"Who am I, really?"

787
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:45,600
And to ask yourself that, I mean, that's...

788
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,200
That's so cool.

789
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,500
Also, you look out the window
all the time, like I do,

790
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,600
only you're looking at the world,
you know.

791
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:03,400
Trying to figure it out.
Trying to understand the world.

792
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:07,300
Trying to figure out why it's not in order,
like your books.

793
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:19,500
I'm only looking at you.

794
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,800
That's either the creepiest

795
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:34,200
or the sweetest thing I've ever heard.

796
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:58,900
Remember the other night?
When we talked about my issues?

797
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:03,700
- You said you didn't have issues.
- Did I?

798
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:08,200
That was bullshit. I got a million issues.

799
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,300
For a guy who killed his teacher?

800
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:18,100
I didn't kill my teacher.

801
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:30,600
What?

802
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,400
- Holy shit.
- What?

803
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,000
What's in the bag?

804
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,000
- Oh, my God.
- What?

805
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:56,400
- What'd you see?
- Red smears.

806
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:02,200
- Blood?
- What should we do?

807
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:07,100
I can't believe you want me
to break into this guy's car.

808
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,400
We need to see what's in the blue bag.

809
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,400
So, get in the car and get
the garage door opener, all right?

810
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,900
Are you sure I'm still in the clear?

811
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,300
Ashley, where's Turner now?

812
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,400
He's shovel shopping.

813
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,400
Visual coming your way.

814
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,800
Are you sure I'm clear?

815
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,700
Yeah, you're golden, man.
He's still in the store.

816
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,700
Okay, here we go.

817
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:48,800
- Well, that's pretty cool.
- What are you talking about?

818
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:50,800
Ashley's got, like, a live feed going here.

819
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:03,100
This is a lot harder than it looks
on the Internet.

820
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,100
You're doing great, man.
You're doing great.

821
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,000
Ashley!

822
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:30,500
- Hi!
- Hi, Skinny Minnie.

823
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:36,500
Where did you hear that name?

824
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:40,000
- Hello? Ashley? Hello. Ashley.
- Son of a bitch. I'm in.

825
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:42,000
There you go!
Nice. All right, start looking around.

826
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:43,300
- Okay.
- Look under the seat, too.

827
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,300
In side compartments, glove box,
the whole nine.

828
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:48,700
- It's not here, dawg.
- Nothing? All right.

829
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,200
All right, keep looking. Hold on.

830
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:53,500
- Yes.
- Kale, I lost Turner.

831
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,600
I ran into Skinny Psycho.

832
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:58,100
You lost...
When is the last time you saw him?

833
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,200
I don't know. About five minutes ago.
His car's gone.

834
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:01,600
All right, hold on.

835
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:03,500
- Okay. Ronnie.
- Yo, yo, here, I found his opener!

836
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,100
Okay, listen to me. Pop it open
and give me the code, okay?

837
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,100
Pop it open
and give me the code right now.

838
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,200
No, no, but it looks like

839
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:09,400
I can just open the garage right now.

840
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,200
No, Ronnie, don't do that.
Don't do that, Ronnie.

841
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:13,600
Just give me the code, okay?

842
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,400
- Why do you sound so agitated?
- Okay, listen.

843
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,300
Ashley just lost Turner,
who's coming home right now.

844
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,000
That's why I'm agitated.
I need you to read me the code. Okay?

845
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,000
- So, pop it open and give it to me.
- What? Oh, no, no, no.

846
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:23,600
Operation Stupid is officially over.

847
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,500
No! Ronald, no! Listen to me.

848
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,700
Stop right there, turn around
and give me the code.

849
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,300
Pop it open and give me the code!
You're right there!

850
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,300
Pop it open and go.
Pop it open and give it to me, Ronald.

851
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:36,400
I can't get this... I can't...
It's not opening, okay?

852
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:38,500
Okay, keep trying. Hold on. Hello?

853
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,000
Kale, you've gotta get Ronnie
out of there. Now!

854
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:41,100
Yeah, I know, I know. He's got the code.

855
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,200
He's giving it to me right now.

856
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:44,600
Well, tell him to hurry. Shit!

857
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,300
Okay, okay, okay.

858
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,500
Hello? Ronald, go.

859
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,500
Are you ready? It's one down.

860
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,600
Miss Carlson.

861
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:54,700
Kale.

862
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,200
Three up, four up. No, no, no.
Sorry, I screwed that.

863
01:04:58,300 --> 01:04:59,400
Okay. Up?

864
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:00,800
Four down.

865
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:01,900
Kale?

866
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:05,900
Hi.

867
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,400
I'm Robert Turner.

868
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,100
I live behind you.

869
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,900
Oh, yeah.

870
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:24,600
Would you mind?

871
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,500
It's just a little rude.

872
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:32,700
What are you doing?

873
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:37,500
Well, I'm officially welcoming you
to the neighborhood.

874
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:43,300
I know that you've been following me.

875
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,300
Don't. No, don't.

876
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:47,600
Don't deny it.

877
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:54,800
I'm not upset. And, quite frankly,
I don't even want to know why.

878
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:00,500
I just would like you to know that

879
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,700
I'm a little on the shy side.

880
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:09,300
So, short of all this sneaking around

881
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:13,700
in some kind of hip, new-aged way

882
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:17,500
of coming on to a somewhat older man,

883
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:23,200
I really feel obliged to tell you

884
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:26,600
that I rather enjoy my privacy.

885
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:35,300
You see, the world is...
It's in a heightened state of paranoia.

886
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:40,400
And I tend to think that someone
as intelligent

887
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:44,300
and attractive as you

888
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:49,600
doesn't need to be wasting her time
stoking the fire.

889
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,400
I...

890
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:59,200
So, now you know.

891
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,700
You're not the only one who's watching.

892
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:15,200
So, feel free to pass that along
if you'd like.

893
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,200
Cool?

894
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Are we cool?

895
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,800
Cool. Cool.

896
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:26,600
Cool.

897
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,000
All right. That's it. Give me the phone.
I'm calling the cops.

898
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:40,400
Wait. He didn't do anything.

899
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:42,200
All he said was that he liked his privacy.

900
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:44,700
But think about that.
Why does he want his privacy?

901
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,100
I mean, he's hiding something.
We know that.

902
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,300
- Yeah, definitely.
- Right?

903
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,400
And he knows that we know that.
He knows that.

904
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:53,400
And regardless of if he had a bad day
or a good... It doesn't matter.

905
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:55,100
He scared the hell out of you.
That's a grown man.

906
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:58,400
Look, Kale, he freaked me out,
but he's right.

907
01:07:58,500 --> 01:07:59,800
We're the ones spying.

908
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:02,300
Oh, man,
she's got that Stockholm thing.

909
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,600
You know, where the hostage
falls for the hostage taker.

910
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:08,100
- Where do you get this stuff?
- I read a lot.

911
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:11,300
Okay. I got a...
How is that a nice or charming guy?

912
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,700
- I didn't say that.
- No, okay, Ash, what you said was...

913
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:16,600
You said, "He broke into my car,
but he did it in a nice way."

914
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:19,700
- Maybe I'm not understanding.
- Okay, you know what?

915
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,900
- Can we just...
- Drop this?

916
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:25,100
This is obviously not
a cute little game anymore.

917
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,200
This has gone way too far.

918
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,800
Hi. No, I'm not over here.

919
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:38,300
Okay, I'm coming.

920
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,300
Parents' anniversary,
amazingly enough.

921
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:48,200
Just drop this, okay?

922
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:50,000
I'll call you later.

923
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:13,400
This is Ronnie. Make it good.

924
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,700
Ronnie, I did some research
on Turner's house, okay?

925
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:18,700
I'm looking at the blueprints, and it says
that when this house was first built,

926
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,200
this main house and the garage
weren't connected.

927
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:22,500
And now there's
this whole middle piece.

928
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,100
That middle piece wasn't there.
I mean, what would he need that for?

929
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:28,000
I'm just thinking out loud. Call me back.

930
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:09,800
- Who is it?
- It's Ronnie, man! Come on!

931
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:11,400
- Did you get my message?
- What? No, listen.

932
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:14,000
- I dropped my phone in his car!
- Wait, wait, wait.

933
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:15,400
- Wait.
- I went home, it wasn't in my pockets.

934
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,400
I must have put it down
when I was putting the thing back on.

935
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:18,500
- Okay, okay, stop.
- I don't want to...

936
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:19,500
Are you understanding what I'm saying?

937
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,500
Okay, look!
We're gonna get your phone, okay?

938
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,500
Here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna get your phone.

939
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,800
But I need you to do
one more thing for me.

940
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,900
- Yeah. Okay. Okay.
- You there?

941
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
How am I looking? Can you see this?

942
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:36,500
Yeah, you're good. I see you.

943
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:40,400
Okay, how does it look over there?
Am I... Is anything moving?

944
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:43,200
How am I looking?

945
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:45,600
- Yeah, you're good to go.
- Okay.

946
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,200
There you go. There you go.

947
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:04,300
Wait, is this... You still got a signal?

948
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:08,200
Yeah, no, I see you, I see you.
Do it from around the corner.

949
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,700
There you go.

950
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:16,400
Are you sure I'm still clear?

951
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,700
No movement. You're fine.

952
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:27,000
Oh, God. I made a lot of noise.
Did you see anything?

953
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:28,500
You're good.

954
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,200
Oh, man, it reeks in here.

955
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:36,100
- What's it smell like?
- Like the corpse of a rotting hottie.

956
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,500
Okay, yes, the door's unlocked.

957
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:44,300
I'm not seeing it, man. It's not in here.

958
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,700
Just keep looking. It's there.
Just calm down.

959
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:47,300
Just be patient, you'll find it.

960
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:50,000
Oh, God, yes. Okay, I got it. I got it.

961
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,700
- Oh, thank you, thank you.
- There you go.

962
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,400
Okay. Okay. Now listen.

963
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:58,000
- You gotta find the bag.
- Okay. All right. Okay.

964
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:01,400
I don't see it.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

965
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:05,000
I see it, I see it. Do you see this?

966
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:07,500
There it is. Good job. Good job.

967
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:10,300
- Okay.
- All right, okay, okay.

968
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:13,400
I just gotta put the camera down
for a second.

969
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:19,000
Oh, yeah.
This is definitely the source of the stink.

970
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:22,000
Bro, I don't want to do this anymore.
I want to come home.

971
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:25,200
Just stay calm. Stay calm.
I need you to look in the bag.

972
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:28,400
God, there's a lot of blood.

973
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:33,500
- Wait a minute, I think that's hair.
- Okay.

974
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,000
Oh, Jesus, this is nasty.

975
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:40,800
Oh, God. This is sticky.

976
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,900
Ronnie, the camera's sliding.
Ronnie. Shit.

977
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:50,900
Well, that was close.

978
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,300
Good save.

979
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:56,300
Okay, I got it. Jesus. How am I looking?

980
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:00,100
Oh, no.

981
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,000
What the...

982
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:07,200
Ronnie? Did you just close the door?

983
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:11,500
I think there's someone in the garage.

984
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:12,900
Help me.

985
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,500
Ronnie.

986
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,800
Oh, shit, he's in the house.

987
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:33,500
Oh, shit!

988
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:35,300
Ronnie?

989
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:45,600
Oh, shit.

990
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,000
Ronnie!

991
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:10,800
Ronnie!

992
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:14,800
Open the door!

993
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:45,200
Officer! Officer!

994
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:47,100
- Listen, my friend, has been kidnapped!
- Drop the bat now!

995
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,700
- Down on the ground!
- Okay. Okay.

996
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,900
Drop it. Now! Clear the bat.

997
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:53,200
The only reason I came here
is my friend is in the house.

998
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:56,700
He's kidnapped by the owner
of the house who's trying to kill him.

999
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,800
- No, come on, man!
- He's claiming a possible 10-31.

1000
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:00,600
- It's open.
- It was open when I got here!

1001
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:02,700
- Breaking and entering.
- Bullshit!

1002
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:06,000
- Mr. Turner?
- Yes, I am. Can I help you?

1003
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:07,700
Sorry to wake you, sir,

1004
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:10,800
but the kid here is claiming
that his friend is in your house.

1005
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:13,400
Do you know anything about that?

1006
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:15,300
No, I certainly don't.

1007
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:16,700
You lying son of a bitch, he's in your...

1008
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,100
- That's it, come on.
- He's in the house.

1009
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,500
- Come on, here we go.
- Okay, look.

1010
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,800
He didn't just wake up five minutes ago.

1011
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:22,700
The man has been kidnapping
and killing people.

1012
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:26,300
Okay? There's a body in a blue bag
in his garage!

1013
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:28,300
Please.

1014
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:32,100
Sir, when we got here,
the door was open.

1015
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:34,600
Well, how would he get the door open?

1016
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,800
I'm not sure, sir. I don't see any signs
of breaking and entering.

1017
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:39,000
Just keep him here for a second.

1018
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:42,500
Yeah, he lives with his mother.
They live back here.

1019
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,900
Just give me a second, sir.

1020
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Something doesn't feel right. Let's just
check it out. Just take a second.

1021
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:50,600
Come on, let's go.

1022
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:56,700
Sir, do you mind
if we take a look inside?

1023
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,500
Not at all. You be my guest.

1024
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,200
- He was stealing?
- Yeah, I think so.

1025
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:02,400
I'm not quite sure, but he did something.

1026
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:47,900
Okay.

1027
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
I hit it the other night.

1028
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:08,000
I thought I could save a few steps
and get it off the road myself.

1029
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,800
I was hoping to bury it sooner,
but it's been a hell of a week.

1030
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:13,900
But you found time to fix your fender,
though, right?

1031
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,900
Well, that car is a classic.

1032
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,600
I had to get it out of storage
for the auto show.

1033
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:19,800
I needed it in pristine condition.

1034
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,300
- The auto show?
- That's right.

1035
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,400
The auto show. Big car fan, huh?

1036
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,200
- All right, that's it.
- The auto show.

1037
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:26,600
Let's go.

1038
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:28,500
- What about my friend then, huh?
- All right, all right.

1039
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,000
- Where's my friend then, huh?
- Let's go. Come on.

1040
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:32,400
Auto show!

1041
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:38,400
It was his second violation, Mrs. Brecht.
He's due in court at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

1042
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:39,800
Can he press charges?

1043
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:41,900
Well, your son was in his house,
Mrs. Brecht,

1044
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,600
and so, yes, Mr. Turner
can file charges if he chooses.

1045
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:48,000
- Thank you.
- Good night.

1046
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:49,500
Good night.

1047
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:58,400
I can't believe this.

1048
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,700
I can't believe you're actually buying
this guy's bullshit.

1049
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,700
- What? After what you just pulled?
- It's bullshit, Mom.

1050
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,200
And everything that's happened
this past year,

1051
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:07,300
it's a miracle
they didn't just take you away.

1052
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:11,100
- I have to go talk to him.
- What are you talking about? Now?

1053
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:12,600
- He could press charges, Kale.
- Now?

1054
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:15,800
- I don't care if he's gonna press...
- Sit down!

1055
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,000
I care.

1056
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:24,000
You are breaking my heart, Kale.

1057
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,500
Oh, shit.
What the hell are you doing, Ma?

1058
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:53,800
Oh, shit.

1059
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,000
Ronnie? Ronnie.

1060
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:08,600
Oh, no.

1061
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:18,700
Piece of shit.

1062
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,100
Ronnie.

1063
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:58,000
- Yo, don't kill me.
- You motherfuck.

1064
01:19:58,100 --> 01:19:59,900
- Don't kill me. Hey...
- Are you serious?

1065
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Do you have any idea
what I've just been through?

1066
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:03,600
Hey! Come on!

1067
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,100
I thought you were dead.

1068
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:08,200
Dude, did you want me to go up
to the cops and be like,

1069
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:11,300
"Oh, hey, you know what, Officer?
He's right. I was in his house.

1070
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,100
"I went in there to get the phone
out of the car

1071
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,000
"that I broke into earlier today."

1072
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:16,900
Look, all I could think of was,
"I don't want to go to jail.

1073
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,200
"Hide. Hide."
And I went into the closet, and...

1074
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:21,900
Okay. All right, okay, okay,
that was a bad joke.

1075
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,700
- I just wasn't thinking straight, okay?
- I get it. I get it.

1076
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:25,800
- Please, please. I'm so...
- Yeah.

1077
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:28,200
- Yeah?
- Oh, God. You bastard.

1078
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:32,100
God. You bastard.

1079
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:35,600
- Hey, so what was in the bag?
- It was a dead deer.

1080
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,800
- Naturally.
- Yeah.

1081
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:42,700
Yo, what is your mom doing over there?

1082
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,000
She's keeping me out of jail.

1083
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,500
Oh, wait. You know what? Then before
they confiscate this evidence,

1084
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,400
you should come over here
and peep this.

1085
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:53,700
I'm serious, man.
I got my whole great escape on video.

1086
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:57,200
I hope this works. I dropped it.
Here we are.

1087
01:20:57,900 --> 01:20:59,700
You know what?
I was in your closet for, like, two weeks.

1088
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,300
I gotta take a piss. Check this out.

1089
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:03,100
- Oh, no.
- Yo, it's genius.

1090
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,400
Ronnie? Did you just close the door?

1091
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,500
I think there's someone in the garage.

1092
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,700
Help me.

1093
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:21,800
What was that?

1094
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:37,700
Yeah, but it's just been
really hard on him.

1095
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:40,100
He still blames himself.

1096
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:43,100
I understand.

1097
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:48,400
I know feelings like that, they don't...
You know, they don't just go away.

1098
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:11,800
Thank you so much.
You've just been so great about all this.

1099
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,600
Well, it's been my pleasure.

1100
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:16,800
Thanks.

1101
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,900
- Good night.
- Okay.

1102
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,400
Ronnie!

1103
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:39,300
Ronnie, get up here! Ronnie!
She's on the tape!

1104
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:42,100
Ronnie!

1105
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,100
The club girl, she's dead!

1106
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:47,600
Ronnie!

1107
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,800
So, he got her on tape?

1108
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:28,600
I really didn't want this.

1109
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:31,800
All I wanted

1110
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:34,900
was to live in peace,

1111
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:40,700
which is why we gotta keep
the spotlight on you.

1112
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,600
You've done most of the work already.

1113
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:47,300
You are the troubled neighborhood boy
who cried wolf.

1114
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:51,800
But now,

1115
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,200
you are really going to snap.

1116
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:07,100
First, you killed your buddy,

1117
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:11,100
because he was calling your girlfriend
behind your back.

1118
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:16,400
And now we gotta
bring your mom over here

1119
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,800
so you can slit her throat,

1120
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:25,300
because she just wouldn't stop
blaming you

1121
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:27,700
for killing your dad.

1122
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,300
So, it sounds good?

1123
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:38,900
Good.

1124
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,600
Pen and paper.

1125
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:51,400
Write this down.

1126
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,700
"Dear Ashley,

1127
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,100
- "I killed Ronnie..."
- Kale?

1128
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:04,100
Kale!

1129
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:06,700
My God. Kale!

1130
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,100
Kale!

1131
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,500
Shut the door. Shut the door. Oh, God.

1132
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:31,000
Grab the phone.

1133
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,800
The scissors! Here, scissors.

1134
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:49,400
- Come on, 911.
- Phone is dead.

1135
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,000
Where is your mom?

1136
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:55,200
Turner's house. Here, take that.

1137
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:01,800
All right, we've gotta get across the line.

1138
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,900
Get ready to run, okay?

1139
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,300
Come on! Go! Jump!

1140
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:38,500
- Kale!
- Go!

1141
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,100
Come on!

1142
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:56,100
I've gotta get my mom.
Make sure the cops are coming, okay?

1143
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,300
- Yeah.
- Okay?

1144
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:58,600
- Go!
- Okay.

1145
01:27:58,700 --> 01:27:59,700
Go!

1146
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:26,100
Mom!

1147
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:33,200
13-Adam? 13-Adam-74, come in.

1148
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:35,100
13-Adam-74. Go ahead.

1149
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:39,700
Yeah, I realize your shift's over,
but that kid just hopped the fence again.

1150
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:41,800
You still want first dibs?

1151
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:47,700
13-Adam-74.
Yeah. Yeah, I'll take care of it.

1152
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:49,600
Roger that. Over.

1153
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,800
Yeah, when I take care of it.

1154
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,600
Mom?

1155
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:18,400
Mom?

1156
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:55,700
Mom?

1157
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:08,300
Mom?

1158
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:21,300
Shit.

1159
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:24,000
Oh, God.

1160
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:25,600
Oh, shit!

1161
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:39,500
Mom?

1162
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:07,200
It's the club girl.

1163
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:11,300
She never left.

1164
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:28,600
Mr. Turner?

1165
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:32,200
Sir, are you here? Police!

1166
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:40,800
Mom?

1167
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:08,900
Mom?

1168
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:27,300
Mom?

1169
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Dispatch, 13-Adam...

1170
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:36,300
Mom?

1171
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:41,400
Hello?

1172
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:49,600
Mom? Mom?

1173
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:09,200
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1174
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:10,400
Oh, God.

1175
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:13,800
You're okay, you're okay.

1176
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:19,800
Here, I got you.

1177
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,700
You made me do this.

1178
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:49,400
You know,

1179
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:51,900
I think you're the first one to ever get

1180
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:55,400
one of these things taken off early
for good behavior.

1181
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:58,000
- Good behavior?
- That's what I'm calling it.

1182
01:36:58,100 --> 01:37:00,800
You got a problem with it,
call somebody who cares.

1183
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:02,300
Good behavior.

1184
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:06,600
You all set to pay the incarceration fee,
Mrs. Brecht?

1185
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:09,300
You're kidding.

1186
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:11,200
No, she's not kidding.

1187
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:12,700
Today counts.

1188
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:14,500
She's not kidding.

1189
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:15,900
No. Look.

1190
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:17,500
Follow me.

1191
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:37,300
So much for being spatially challenged.

1192
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:39,000
Does it scare you?

1193
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:41,100
Oh, yes. It terrifies me.

1194
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:54,900
So, what happens now?

1195
01:37:57,100 --> 01:37:58,100
- Did you see that?
- Hello?

1196
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:01,000
Mrs. Greenwood, hi. This is Joe Smith
from the satellite company.

1197
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:04,400
Well, we're just calling to check up
on our adult programming subscribers.

1198
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:06,800
- What are you talking about?
- Skin flicks, ma'am.

1199
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:09,200
- That's what the kids are calling 'em.
- Excuse me? What?

1200
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:13,100
Well, we see that you're currently
accessing it, ma'am, as we speak.

1201
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:15,400
From receiver 3,
second floor of your house.

1202
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:17,300
- But that's not possible.
- I'm just doing my job.

1203
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:18,400
- Okay.
- Thanks for your call.

1204
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:20,000
Yes, ma'am.

1205
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:24,800
What are you watching?
What do you think you're doing?

1206
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Nice.

1207
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,900
And I am calling your mother!

1208
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:31,600
- You feel better now?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1209
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:33,700
- But that's just the first strike, though.
- Really?

1210
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:36,700
Well, yeah, it's an ongoing offensive
against neighborhood evil.

1211
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:38,100
I'm very dedicated.

1212
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:39,700
You're my hero.

1213
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:01,100
Soon to be the most popular video
on YouTube.
