1
00:05:08,232 --> 00:05:10,893
Take a sample of her blood...

2
00:05:11,335 --> 00:05:14,203
...and then get rid of that.
- Yes, sir.

3
00:07:02,313 --> 00:07:05,544
<i>The Umbrella Corporation thought</i>
<i>they'd contained the infection.</i>

4
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,012
<i>Well, they were wrong.</i>

5
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,186
<i>Raccoon City was just the beginning.</i>

6
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:13,118
<i>Within weeks, the T-virus</i>
<i>had consumed the United States.</i>

7
00:07:13,324 --> 00:07:15,292
<i>Within months, the world.</i>

8
00:07:15,493 --> 00:07:17,757
<i>The virus didn't just</i>
<i>wipe out human life.</i>

9
00:07:17,962 --> 00:07:20,931
<i>Lakes and rivers dried up,</i>
<i>forests became deserts...</i>

10
00:07:21,132 --> 00:07:23,032
<i>... and whole continents</i>
<i>were reduced to...</i>

11
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,566
<i>... nothing more than</i>
<i>barren wastelands.</i>

12
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:30,833
<i>Slowly but surely, the Earth</i>
<i>began to wither and die.</i>

13
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,882
<i>What few survivors there were</i>
<i>learned to keep on the move.</i>

14
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,752
<i>We avoided major cities.</i>

15
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,657
<i>If we stopped anyplace too long,</i>
<i>they would be drawn to us.</i>

16
00:07:52,864 --> 00:07:56,356
<i>Only a few at first,</i>
<i>but then more and more.</i>

17
00:07:56,567 --> 00:08:00,264
<i>A never-ending army of undead.</i>

18
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:02,462
<i>For those of us left...</i>

19
00:08:02,673 --> 00:08:04,504
<i>... staying on the road...</i>

20
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:06,870
<i>... seemed the only way to stay alive.</i>

21
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,720
<i>This is KLKB.</i>
<i>We have seven people here...</i>

22
00:08:21,926 --> 00:08:23,894
<i>... in need of urgent medical attention.</i>

23
00:08:24,095 --> 00:08:27,553
<i>We need help. This is KLKB.</i>
<i>Can anyone hear us?</i>

24
00:08:27,765 --> 00:08:30,325
<i>Can anyone help us? Please?</i>

25
00:09:38,936 --> 00:09:40,096
My baby.

26
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,129
Please.

27
00:09:43,341 --> 00:09:44,774
Please help my baby.

28
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,449
You bitch.

29
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,628
You dropped my baby.

30
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:10,465
"We're surrounded. We need help.
Can anyone hear us?

31
00:10:10,668 --> 00:10:14,661
- Can anyone help us? Please."
- Works every time, Mama.

32
00:10:14,872 --> 00:10:16,863
Let's see...

33
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,941
...what else she's packing.
- Yeah.

34
00:10:23,381 --> 00:10:24,973
What you got down there, fishy?

35
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,942
I wouldn't do that.

36
00:10:30,821 --> 00:10:31,947
Shut your mouth!

37
00:10:32,356 --> 00:10:34,551
- Relax!
- Just show the bitch.

38
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,896
Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!

39
00:10:43,701 --> 00:10:45,396
Jesus Christ! He's dead!

40
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,491
Think you're pretty smart, huh?

41
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:12,185
Well, you'll see.

42
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,731
There you go, bitch.
I wouldn't want it to be over too fast!

43
00:11:28,512 --> 00:11:30,537
Open the cage!

44
00:11:57,141 --> 00:11:58,199
Let them loose.

45
00:13:04,441 --> 00:13:05,840
Get up now!

46
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,185
That was a juicy one, huh?

47
00:14:51,282 --> 00:14:52,943
Hey, Carlos, this is Claire.

48
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,448
- You got any smokes?
- <i>No.</i>

49
00:14:55,653 --> 00:14:57,450
Like I'm supposed to believe that.

50
00:14:58,756 --> 00:15:00,656
Claire, would I lie to you?

51
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,896
- <i>L.J.</i>
- Claire Redfield, how can I help you?

52
00:15:12,469 --> 00:15:14,960
- Got any smokes?
- <i>No can do.</i>

53
00:15:16,073 --> 00:15:17,267
How about alternate?

54
00:15:17,474 --> 00:15:20,375
Sorry to say we're out of that too.

55
00:15:20,577 --> 00:15:22,670
You gotta be shitting me. Otto?

56
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,777
Sorry, campers. Smoked the last of it
back in Salt Lake.

57
00:15:26,984 --> 00:15:28,076
Damn.

58
00:15:28,285 --> 00:15:29,912
- <i>Yeah, people...</i>
- Damn it.

59
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,917
<i>... it really is the end of the world.</i>

60
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,549
- Anyone else?
- Paris facility.

61
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,249
Food supplies down to 50 percent.

62
00:16:10,461 --> 00:16:14,329
Six casualties.
Biohazard numbers increasing.

63
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,630
London facility.

64
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:20,270
Food supplies down to 28 percent.
Seventeen casualties.

65
00:16:20,471 --> 00:16:22,837
Biohazard numbers increasing.

66
00:16:23,474 --> 00:16:24,498
Gentlemen.

67
00:16:25,342 --> 00:16:26,400
Dr. Isaacs.

68
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,935
How good of the science division
to join us.

69
00:16:29,146 --> 00:16:31,979
Chairman Wesker. I've been busy.

70
00:16:32,182 --> 00:16:35,879
On the subject of the biohazard,
what is the science division's report?

71
00:16:36,854 --> 00:16:40,915
Well, we now know conclusively that
they have no real need for sustenance.

72
00:16:41,592 --> 00:16:45,323
They hunger for flesh
but do not require it.

73
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:49,090
My research indicates
they could remain active for decades.

74
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,760
We're to be trapped underground
for decades?

75
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,302
What news of Project Alice?

76
00:16:55,506 --> 00:16:57,940
Using antibodies from her blood...

77
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:02,943
...I will develop a serum that will not
just combat the effects of the T-virus...

78
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,638
...but potentially reverse it...

79
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:09,080
...giving back these creatures
a measure of their intelligence...

80
00:17:09,286 --> 00:17:14,383
...their memories,
thus curbing their hunger for flesh.

81
00:17:14,591 --> 00:17:17,025
You're confident you can
domesticate them?

82
00:17:18,262 --> 00:17:21,060
They're animals, essentially.

83
00:17:21,265 --> 00:17:26,168
We can train them, if we can
take away their baser instincts.

84
00:17:26,904 --> 00:17:28,132
They'll never be human...

85
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:32,069
...but would provide the basis
for a docile workforce.

86
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:33,806
We can return to the surface.

87
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,479
After months of experiments,
you have nothing to show.

88
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,945
- We are left to rot underground.
- Without the original Project Alice...

89
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,674
...progress has been difficult.

90
00:17:41,885 --> 00:17:44,877
I've been forced to replicate her
using cloned genetic models.

91
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:48,252
It's laborious.
The results, unpredictable.

92
00:17:48,459 --> 00:17:53,158
Project Alice and the subject of
domestication is of the highest priority.

93
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:57,489
You will concentrate on this to
the exclusion of all other research.

94
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,464
We expect an updated report
in a week.

95
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,969
Simply demanding results
will not guarantee them.

96
00:18:03,173 --> 00:18:05,641
Then perhaps we should place
someone else in charge.

97
00:18:05,843 --> 00:18:09,176
Someone who can give us
the reassurances we require.

98
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,177
Continue with your research, doctor...

99
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,545
...while it still is your research.

100
00:18:15,752 --> 00:18:17,777
This meeting is adjourned.

101
00:18:32,169 --> 00:18:34,694
Sorry about this, Stevie.

102
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,632
<i>This is Claire Redfield's convoy,</i>
<i>broadcasting for any survivors.</i>

103
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,572
<i>Is anybody out there?</i>

104
00:20:23,213 --> 00:20:26,512
<i>Broadcasting for any survivors.</i>
<i>Is anybody out there?</i>

105
00:20:30,821 --> 00:20:33,984
<i>This is Claire Redfield's convoy,</i>
<i>broadcasting for any survivors.</i>

106
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,715
<i>Is anybody out there?</i>

107
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:45,121
This is Claire Redfield's convoy.
Location, the Desert Trail Motel.

108
00:21:45,362 --> 00:21:48,422
Broadcasting for any survivors.
Is there anybody in there?

109
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,726
Broadcasting for any survivors.
Is there anybody in there?

110
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,563
Keep trying, Mikey.

111
00:21:55,706 --> 00:21:57,298
Is there anyone alive in there?

112
00:21:58,141 --> 00:21:59,836
<i>Please respond.</i>

113
00:22:00,043 --> 00:22:02,637
- Seems quiet.
- Yeah, don't they always?

114
00:22:02,913 --> 00:22:05,507
<i>Is there anyone alive in there?</i>
<i>Please respond.</i>

115
00:22:05,716 --> 00:22:08,776
Claire. Looks clear. Shall we go in?

116
00:22:08,985 --> 00:22:11,044
It's your call, boys.

117
00:22:12,222 --> 00:22:15,419
- Come on. Let's go.
- Let's do it.

118
00:22:51,862 --> 00:22:53,625
I'm gonna get me a room.

119
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:57,357
I'll take a waterbed, a Jacuzzi...

120
00:22:57,567 --> 00:22:59,694
...and I'm gonna rent me a porno.

121
00:25:08,899 --> 00:25:10,594
<i>What happened? You two okay?</i>

122
00:25:11,768 --> 00:25:13,258
Yeah. It's all clear.

123
00:25:25,181 --> 00:25:26,773
Somebody need my help?

124
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:30,681
It's nothing. But if you insist...

125
00:25:30,887 --> 00:25:33,447
That's right. So sit back and relax.

126
00:25:36,293 --> 00:25:40,787
Spread out. Look for anything of use.
Gas, food, ammo. You know the drill.

127
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:43,295
You like playing rough, huh?

128
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,230
- Oh, I've had worse.
- I'm sure.

129
00:25:46,937 --> 00:25:49,462
But you've always been gentle
with me, Betty.

130
00:25:49,906 --> 00:25:53,342
Oh, God. I'm leaving.

131
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,606
So, what do we say,
dinner at my place tonight?

132
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,245
Oh, I'm there.

133
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,577
Hey, Betty! Over here!

134
00:26:50,767 --> 00:26:53,361
This is amazing.
He knows what it is.

135
00:26:58,642 --> 00:27:00,234
Camera.

136
00:27:01,811 --> 00:27:03,005
You try.

137
00:27:10,687 --> 00:27:12,587
Stand your ground.

138
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,720
- My God.
- Unbelievable.

139
00:27:35,545 --> 00:27:37,206
He has memory
and reasoning skills.

140
00:27:37,414 --> 00:27:41,475
This is incredible. The serum works.
You've domesticated them.

141
00:27:41,685 --> 00:27:44,210
You've done it. Congratulations.

142
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,060
No, doctor! Please. No!

143
00:27:55,732 --> 00:27:57,859
No, no, doctor. Please, no!

144
00:28:12,716 --> 00:28:15,685
Pork and beans. I'll get some
peaches for the little one there.

145
00:28:15,885 --> 00:28:17,147
There you go.

146
00:28:17,353 --> 00:28:19,947
- It's asparagus.
- Thanks.

147
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,453
For you...

148
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,091
...cat food.

149
00:28:25,295 --> 00:28:27,525
Just kidding. It's pork and beans.

150
00:28:28,531 --> 00:28:30,897
- Hey.
- What's this, huh?

151
00:28:31,101 --> 00:28:33,296
- Soup. Cream of mushroom.
- Bullshit.

152
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:36,165
- I think that's pork and beans too.
- Thanks, man.

153
00:28:36,706 --> 00:28:38,139
- I'll be damned.
- Asparagus.

154
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,400
- How do you do that?
- Just one of my skills.

155
00:28:40,643 --> 00:28:43,510
It's a dying art, unfortunately.

156
00:28:43,713 --> 00:28:45,613
This is the last of it.

157
00:28:45,815 --> 00:28:48,613
- I think it's some kind of fruit.
- Thanks, Otto.

158
00:28:49,085 --> 00:28:50,950
Sorry, that's all we have.

159
00:28:51,154 --> 00:28:53,418
Fruit. You want some fruit?

160
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,586
Fruit. You want some fruit?

161
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,167
- Did you check out the gas station?
- Yep, it's bone-dry.

162
00:29:09,005 --> 00:29:10,597
Well, how we looking here?

163
00:29:11,307 --> 00:29:14,504
Well, Claire, if we can run
these trucks on rust...

164
00:29:14,944 --> 00:29:16,502
...we're looking pretty good.

165
00:29:17,247 --> 00:29:18,236
All right.

166
00:29:23,153 --> 00:29:24,711
Hey, sweetheart.

167
00:29:24,921 --> 00:29:26,252
Perimeter up yet?

168
00:29:26,456 --> 00:29:28,424
It's almost done.

169
00:29:29,526 --> 00:29:31,289
- Who's out there?
- Olivera.

170
00:29:34,364 --> 00:29:36,628
- <i>Hey, Carlos.</i>
- Claire.

171
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:40,030
<i>All that smoking is slowing you down.</i>
<i>Get your ass in gear, old man.</i>

172
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:42,528
I want my perimeter up.

173
00:29:58,054 --> 00:30:00,420
Last sentinel in place.

174
00:30:00,623 --> 00:30:05,151
Perimeter's up and running.
All motion sensors online.

175
00:30:06,162 --> 00:30:07,686
Cameras 100 percent.

176
00:30:12,569 --> 00:30:14,799
Refried beans. Fruit salad.

177
00:30:15,004 --> 00:30:16,733
Oh, my favorite.

178
00:30:17,874 --> 00:30:19,239
Storm's coming!

179
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:22,502
Let's start packing it up
and move it inside.

180
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,342
- Come on, kids, let's go!
- Hurry up!

181
00:30:25,548 --> 00:30:28,483
Get back in the bus.
Put this fire out.

182
00:31:04,754 --> 00:31:08,212
This is Claire Redfield's convoy.
Location, the Desert Trail Motel.

183
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:12,693
<i>Lat. 35, long. 114.</i>
<i>Calling any survivors.</i>

184
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:18,699
<i>This is Claire Redfield's convoy.</i>
<i>Location, the Desert Trail Motel.</i>

185
00:31:18,935 --> 00:31:22,701
<i>Lat. 35, long. 114.</i>
<i>Calling any survivors.</i>

186
00:32:28,871 --> 00:32:30,839
Activate Number 87.

187
00:33:53,589 --> 00:33:54,886
Shit.

188
00:33:55,091 --> 00:33:57,025
- Dr. Isaacs.
- What is it?

189
00:33:57,226 --> 00:33:59,990
My sensors have detected a peak
in psionic activity.

190
00:34:00,229 --> 00:34:02,220
Both alpha and beta wave.

191
00:34:02,432 --> 00:34:03,797
From Number 87?

192
00:34:04,033 --> 00:34:06,365
No, the activity's not from
one of the clones.

193
00:34:06,569 --> 00:34:09,094
It occurred outside the complex.

194
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,136
- That's not possible.
- My sensors were quite clear.

195
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:17,938
Massive psionic activity was detected
15 minutes ago...

196
00:34:18,147 --> 00:34:20,809
...centered on a desert location.

197
00:36:05,388 --> 00:36:07,720
- Claire!
- What?

198
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,047
What the hell?

199
00:36:33,182 --> 00:36:34,774
Oh, God.

200
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:46,589
- Carlos.
- I see them.

201
00:36:48,564 --> 00:36:50,759
Everybody stay in your trucks.

202
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,897
What's going on?

203
00:36:54,403 --> 00:36:56,530
<i>Everyone just stay in your trucks.</i>

204
00:36:56,739 --> 00:36:59,105
Roll up the windows and keep quiet.

205
00:36:59,609 --> 00:37:01,236
Okay, close the windows up.

206
00:37:20,496 --> 00:37:22,464
What's wrong with their eyes?

207
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:26,426
They've been feeding
on infected flesh.

208
00:37:44,954 --> 00:37:47,821
- Fire it up. Let's get out of here.
- That's a hell of an idea.

209
00:37:48,024 --> 00:37:49,514
Lock and load.

210
00:37:55,031 --> 00:37:58,091
- We're stuck!
- Hell, no, let's get out of here.

211
00:38:02,538 --> 00:38:04,802
Let's head for the bus, come on.

212
00:38:10,379 --> 00:38:13,143
Come on! Go! Go!

213
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:15,544
Come on, get in!
Come on, come on, come on.

214
00:38:27,897 --> 00:38:29,330
Claire!

215
00:38:31,233 --> 00:38:32,666
Damn it.

216
00:38:32,902 --> 00:38:34,961
Mikey, Carlos,
we have to evac the bus.

217
00:38:36,172 --> 00:38:37,730
You got it.

218
00:38:40,376 --> 00:38:41,741
Hold it!

219
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:05,096
- Come on, move!
- Keep moving!

220
00:39:18,214 --> 00:39:21,615
Come on! Go! Go! Go! Come on!

221
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,944
- Betty!
- Go! Just go!

222
00:39:36,031 --> 00:39:38,397
Get out of here, Betty! Go!

223
00:39:38,634 --> 00:39:41,398
- Move! Move! Move!
- Go!

224
00:39:45,241 --> 00:39:47,835
- Betty! Betty!
- L.J., hurry up!

225
00:39:49,945 --> 00:39:51,242
Come with me!

226
00:40:06,796 --> 00:40:09,458
Come on! Come on! Betty! Betty!

227
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,733
No!

228
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,169
Betty!

229
00:40:29,318 --> 00:40:31,013
Go! Go! Go!

230
00:41:28,811 --> 00:41:30,369
Dr. Isaacs.

231
00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:32,911
Another spike in alpha
and beta waves detected.

232
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:37,313
Forty-five percent probability
that this is Project Alice.

233
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,250
Triangulate. Find her location.

234
00:41:44,426 --> 00:41:46,326
Impressive.

235
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,195
If it is her, her development
is extraordinary.

236
00:41:49,398 --> 00:41:52,128
Her powers would appear to have
grown at a geometric rate...

237
00:41:52,334 --> 00:41:55,428
...since her escape from
the Detroit facility.

238
00:41:58,007 --> 00:42:02,171
You've made 10 trips to the surface
in the past 24 hours. All unauthorized.

239
00:42:02,411 --> 00:42:06,677
Any trip to the surface, especially to
gather specimens, puts my men at risk.

240
00:42:06,882 --> 00:42:08,873
Why do you need so many
all of a sudden?

241
00:42:09,084 --> 00:42:10,881
Isaacs!

242
00:42:11,086 --> 00:42:13,418
My research has intensified.

243
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,920
Don't worry.
They're perfectly secure.

244
00:42:25,467 --> 00:42:27,560
You're supposed to be
domesticating them.

245
00:42:27,803 --> 00:42:29,794
Sometimes aggression has its uses.

246
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:32,371
What could you possibly need
these things for?

247
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,872
Dr. Isaacs.

248
00:42:34,076 --> 00:42:37,705
Specimen 87 has reached
the final stage of the test grid.

249
00:42:37,913 --> 00:42:40,404
Perfect. Put her on the screen.

250
00:42:45,421 --> 00:42:47,013
Good girl.

251
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,294
Is Chairman Wesker
even aware of this?

252
00:42:57,499 --> 00:42:59,933
He knows what he needs to know.

253
00:43:00,302 --> 00:43:02,463
You've overstepped your mark.

254
00:43:03,072 --> 00:43:06,405
My research will change
the face of everything.

255
00:43:08,143 --> 00:43:10,111
If you pick a side...

256
00:43:11,614 --> 00:43:13,582
...be sure it's the right one.

257
00:43:35,604 --> 00:43:36,866
Hi.

258
00:43:37,373 --> 00:43:38,863
Hey.

259
00:43:43,345 --> 00:43:44,937
This belong to you?

260
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,814
I gave it to you last night.

261
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,350
For luck.

262
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,580
Thank you.

263
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:54,882
What's your name?

264
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:57,019
K-Mart.

265
00:43:58,127 --> 00:43:59,719
It's where they found me.

266
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:01,987
Claire and the other...

267
00:44:02,331 --> 00:44:03,662
A few years back.

268
00:44:04,667 --> 00:44:07,568
Do you have another name?

269
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,733
Never liked it.

270
00:44:12,341 --> 00:44:14,901
Everyone I knew was dead...

271
00:44:16,345 --> 00:44:18,404
...so seemed like time for a change.

272
00:44:27,523 --> 00:44:29,821
Anyone want to say something?

273
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:57,178
Alice, this is Claire Redfield.

274
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:00,454
She's the one who put this
convoy together.

275
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,283
Thank you so much for your help.

276
00:45:03,058 --> 00:45:04,116
Claire!

277
00:45:06,361 --> 00:45:09,330
Excuse me. I have things
I have to attend to.

278
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:18,071
In the last six months,
she lost half of the convoy.

279
00:45:19,041 --> 00:45:22,135
Pretty soon there'll be
more of us dead than alive.

280
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:25,877
Alice, what happened to you?

281
00:45:26,415 --> 00:45:28,440
Why did you leave after Detroit?

282
00:45:29,418 --> 00:45:32,649
I didn't have a choice.
They were using me.

283
00:45:33,655 --> 00:45:35,555
What do you mean?

284
00:45:35,758 --> 00:45:37,453
They were tracking me.

285
00:45:37,659 --> 00:45:39,718
I couldn't be around you.
Any of you.

286
00:45:40,329 --> 00:45:44,095
- I would've gotten you all killed.
- That's why you disappeared?

287
00:45:44,299 --> 00:45:48,292
Broke into an Umbrella facility
and hacked into their computers...

288
00:45:48,504 --> 00:45:51,234
...downloaded the satellite
trajectories...

289
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,465
...and stayed off the grid.

290
00:45:53,675 --> 00:45:55,700
And after the world ended?

291
00:45:55,911 --> 00:45:58,379
Why stay out there alone?

292
00:46:00,249 --> 00:46:04,117
It's just safer
if I'm not around people.

293
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,747
Why'd you come back?

294
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:33,271
Damn!

295
00:46:34,883 --> 00:46:36,282
What time is it?

296
00:46:36,485 --> 00:46:38,544
Chase, what time is it?

297
00:46:40,489 --> 00:46:45,358
Well, Carlos, it is 12:14. Why?
You got somewhere you gotta be?

298
00:46:46,995 --> 00:46:48,656
Guess I'm just being paranoid.

299
00:46:56,705 --> 00:46:58,605
Welcome home.

300
00:47:07,716 --> 00:47:09,308
Got a minute?

301
00:47:09,985 --> 00:47:11,009
Yeah.

302
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,745
Everyone is grateful
for you helping us out.

303
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:16,390
But how long am I gonna stay?

304
00:47:16,592 --> 00:47:18,617
Don't get me wrong.

305
00:47:19,161 --> 00:47:21,425
We really are grateful.

306
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:27,761
They're all talking about what you did.
And they're scared.

307
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,870
I don't blame them.

308
00:47:31,707 --> 00:47:34,801
People have a habit
of dying around me.

309
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:37,406
Not just you.

310
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,054
<i>You're positive it's her?</i>

311
00:47:48,257 --> 00:47:52,717
Sixty-two percent.
Too great a chance to pass up.

312
00:47:53,562 --> 00:47:57,396
If it is Project Alice, she's been
evading the satellite grid for years.

313
00:47:57,633 --> 00:47:59,601
I've re-routed
the remaining satellites.

314
00:47:59,801 --> 00:48:02,736
We can reacquire the subject.
She'll be unaware of surveillance.

315
00:48:02,971 --> 00:48:05,166
I can have a strike team ready
within the hour.

316
00:48:05,374 --> 00:48:09,572
No. We'll establish
a positive identification first.

317
00:48:09,778 --> 00:48:11,439
One hundred percent.

318
00:48:11,647 --> 00:48:14,810
The group she's with
include known associates.

319
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:18,544
The original Project Alice
is vital to my research...

320
00:48:18,754 --> 00:48:21,348
...to the whole process
of domestication. Her blood...

321
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:23,785
...her genetic structure, is the key.

322
00:48:23,992 --> 00:48:26,825
The longer she's out there,
the greater chance we lose her.

323
00:48:27,062 --> 00:48:29,929
- I can't risk that.
- That decision isn't yours to make.

324
00:48:31,066 --> 00:48:33,933
Take no action until this matter has
been discussed by the committee...

325
00:48:34,136 --> 00:48:37,435
...at the next scheduled meeting.
And, doctor...

326
00:48:37,639 --> 00:48:38,731
...that's an order.

327
00:48:43,345 --> 00:48:47,008
These transmissions are the best
indication of life we've seen in months.

328
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:49,115
- Alaska?
- We have to check it out.

329
00:48:49,318 --> 00:48:50,717
We can't just ignore it.

330
00:48:50,919 --> 00:48:52,910
Any idea what kind
of journey that would be?

331
00:48:53,121 --> 00:48:56,147
- Yeah. A long one.
- And at the end of it, what?

332
00:48:56,358 --> 00:48:59,054
You have no guarantee there's even
anyone alive up there.

333
00:48:59,261 --> 00:49:02,753
- These transmissions say that...
- They're dated six months ago.

334
00:49:02,965 --> 00:49:05,331
How many radio broadcasts
have we responded to?

335
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:08,794
How many times
have we got there too late?

336
00:49:09,004 --> 00:49:12,804
The transmissions say that
there's no infection up there.

337
00:49:13,008 --> 00:49:14,498
It's isolated.

338
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:16,041
Safe.

339
00:49:17,045 --> 00:49:19,775
This convoy trusts me
with their lives.

340
00:49:19,982 --> 00:49:21,973
These people don't need
pipe dreams.

341
00:49:22,451 --> 00:49:24,544
Maybe that's exactly what they need.

342
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:26,713
Look at them, Claire.

343
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:32,056
Six months ago, there were 50 of us,
then 40, now there's less than 30.

344
00:49:33,462 --> 00:49:35,521
They're starting to give up.

345
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,456
They need some kind of hope.

346
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:48,435
We have a decision to make.

347
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:52,804
And it's too big, it's too important
for me to make for you.

348
00:49:54,349 --> 00:49:56,374
There's a chance
there are survivors.

349
00:49:56,585 --> 00:49:57,950
Where?

350
00:49:58,153 --> 00:50:00,053
In Alaska.

351
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:03,450
There is a chance...

352
00:50:03,658 --> 00:50:06,752
...that the infection
hasn't reached that far.

353
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:09,192
But we don't know for sure.

354
00:50:09,398 --> 00:50:11,229
So we have a choice.

355
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,396
We stay as we are...

356
00:50:14,169 --> 00:50:16,262
...or we try for Alaska.

357
00:50:18,707 --> 00:50:20,504
For Alaska.

358
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:28,176
Alaska.

359
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,087
I hope you're right.

360
00:50:54,543 --> 00:50:55,942
God.

361
00:51:09,758 --> 00:51:12,921
The food's virtually gone
and the truck's running on empty.

362
00:51:13,161 --> 00:51:15,391
I've got half a tank of gas. That's it.

363
00:51:15,597 --> 00:51:18,327
- Chase?
- Shit, I don't even have empty.

364
00:51:18,967 --> 00:51:21,834
I got enough for
a hundred miles, tops.

365
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:24,733
If we're gonna make this trip,
we'll need to resupply.

366
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,407
Yep.

367
00:51:27,576 --> 00:51:29,237
These are our options.

368
00:51:29,444 --> 00:51:33,141
The nearest, safest bet
is right there.

369
00:51:33,648 --> 00:51:36,082
No, it's empty. I tried that.

370
00:51:37,185 --> 00:51:39,085
Then, well, maybe...

371
00:51:39,287 --> 00:51:41,949
- We could try this...
- Vegas.

372
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:45,618
It's the only place we're sure to find
gas and supplies.

373
00:51:45,827 --> 00:51:48,318
There's a reason for that.
Vegas is too dangerous.

374
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:50,191
It's crawling with them
sons of bitches.

375
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:53,367
We've drained every small town dry
over the last six months.

376
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:55,934
We have to hit a big city.

377
00:51:56,204 --> 00:51:57,831
She's right.

378
00:51:58,206 --> 00:52:00,504
Vegas, it's our only bet.

379
00:52:08,683 --> 00:52:11,311
<i>We'll establish</i>
<i>a positive identification.</i>

380
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,885
<i>One hundred percent.</i>

381
00:52:13,822 --> 00:52:18,156
<i>Take no action until this matter has</i>
<i>been discussed by the committee.</i>

382
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,218
<i>Doctor...</i>

383
00:52:20,829 --> 00:52:22,524
<i>... that's an order.</i>

384
00:52:32,541 --> 00:52:36,068
<i>The committee authorizes</i>
<i>immediate action.</i>

385
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:39,213
<i>Release of vehicles</i>
<i>and personnel...</i>

386
00:52:39,414 --> 00:52:42,747
<i>... under command of Dr. Isaacs.</i>

387
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,086
<i>That's an order.</i>

388
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,575
Hey. You all right?

389
00:54:16,778 --> 00:54:18,609
Yeah, I'm fine.

390
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:22,911
Them pork and beans, they lethal.
I don't see how you cowboys do it.

391
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:26,187
Years of practice.

392
00:54:37,966 --> 00:54:39,763
Oh, my God.

393
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:14,826
What happened to it?

394
00:55:15,503 --> 00:55:17,664
The desert must have taken it back.

395
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:19,766
Five years.

396
00:55:19,974 --> 00:55:22,238
No one to keep the sand back.

397
00:55:30,085 --> 00:55:31,746
It's empty.

398
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:33,346
No undead.

399
00:55:34,255 --> 00:55:35,847
Nothing.

400
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:39,786
Those birds must have moved
through the city block by block.

401
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:42,089
Picked it clean.

402
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:52,569
I don't see any truck stops.

403
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,165
Where are they?

404
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:56,871
There.

405
00:55:57,078 --> 00:55:59,740
Valet parking at the casino
up ahead.

406
00:55:59,948 --> 00:56:01,779
There's gas pumps in there.

407
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:03,678
Now, how do you know that?

408
00:56:03,885 --> 00:56:05,785
I dropped two G's
back in the day here.

409
00:56:06,254 --> 00:56:08,085
You lost $2000?

410
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:26,033
Damn it.

411
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:40,048
Spread them out!

412
00:56:43,091 --> 00:56:44,490
We're gonna have to move it.

413
00:56:58,573 --> 00:57:00,803
All right, Chase, I need a lookout!

414
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:02,971
Up there.

415
00:57:11,853 --> 00:57:13,548
Great.

416
00:57:23,998 --> 00:57:28,128
Climb the Eiffel Tower
with a high-powered rifle.

417
00:57:28,703 --> 00:57:31,365
A few years ago,
that would've caused a stir.

418
00:57:33,641 --> 00:57:37,372
Well, let the good times roll.

419
00:57:57,165 --> 00:57:58,223
Let's get this done.

420
00:57:58,833 --> 00:58:01,165
Get the hell out of here.
Mikey, get the winch.

421
00:58:01,369 --> 00:58:02,802
- Yeah.
- Carlos.

422
00:58:32,267 --> 00:58:33,825
Wait.

423
00:58:41,209 --> 00:58:42,574
Get back!

424
00:59:11,639 --> 00:59:13,106
- Carlos, cover me!
- Go!

425
01:00:04,525 --> 01:00:05,890
Move!

426
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:37,653
Just get to the back and stay quiet.
Go! Now! Go!

427
01:00:40,194 --> 01:00:41,456
Get down!

428
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:58,404
She really is magnificent.

429
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:03,041
When she's dead,
make sure you move in fast.

430
01:02:03,244 --> 01:02:05,974
I need a sample of her blood
while it's still warm.

431
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,239
That won't be a problem.

432
01:02:10,184 --> 01:02:13,051
- Satellite in position?
- Yes, sir.

433
01:02:14,155 --> 01:02:16,146
Then shut her down.

434
01:02:55,029 --> 01:02:56,758
Mikey!

435
01:03:02,336 --> 01:03:03,428
Hey!

436
01:03:21,823 --> 01:03:23,347
Mikey!

437
01:03:26,894 --> 01:03:27,952
No!

438
01:03:28,830 --> 01:03:30,695
No!

439
01:03:59,026 --> 01:04:01,358
She's fighting the conditioning.

440
01:04:01,562 --> 01:04:02,927
Boost the control signal.

441
01:04:10,605 --> 01:04:11,697
Shit!

442
01:04:11,906 --> 01:04:14,534
Climb! Give me your hand!

443
01:04:21,949 --> 01:04:24,144
Run! Go!

444
01:04:24,352 --> 01:04:26,411
Go! Run!

445
01:04:26,621 --> 01:04:28,384
Let's go!

446
01:04:41,769 --> 01:04:42,793
L.J.!

447
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:48,198
L.J.

448
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:17,830
What is it?

449
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:20,303
Satellite. Some kind of malfunction.

450
01:05:48,703 --> 01:05:49,863
How long?

451
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:53,700
New feed coming online
in 15 seconds.

452
01:05:58,479 --> 01:06:00,970
Online in three, two...

453
01:06:01,849 --> 01:06:03,282
Now.

454
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:08,079
Where the hell is she going?

455
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:12,619
Shut her down!

456
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:19,490
She's still coming!

457
01:06:20,701 --> 01:06:23,135
- Now!
- Oh, shit.

458
01:06:28,609 --> 01:06:29,803
You son of a...

459
01:06:31,612 --> 01:06:33,443
Back to base!

460
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:42,389
The anti-virus!
Get me the anti-virus!

461
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:00,868
Why didn't you shoot?

462
01:07:01,075 --> 01:07:04,841
Because we're not driving to Alaska.
I want that helicopter intact.

463
01:07:05,446 --> 01:07:08,381
Let's go look at the computer,
see where that chopper's headed.

464
01:07:22,763 --> 01:07:24,321
- How is he?
- Under house arrest...

465
01:07:24,532 --> 01:07:27,023
...as you instructed.
He's been quiet.

466
01:07:42,049 --> 01:07:43,812
How much of this have you used?

467
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:46,213
Her blood increased
the creatures' power.

468
01:07:46,987 --> 01:07:49,854
It also increased the strength
of the infection.

469
01:07:53,427 --> 01:07:54,917
I needed it.

470
01:07:55,429 --> 01:07:58,057
You have no idea
what this will do to you.

471
01:08:01,535 --> 01:08:04,993
Oh, I have an idea.

472
01:08:05,773 --> 01:08:07,798
You're out of control.

473
01:08:08,542 --> 01:08:09,975
Well, this ends here.

474
01:08:10,177 --> 01:08:12,941
Under executive order 1345,
issued by Chairman Wesker...

475
01:08:13,147 --> 01:08:15,308
...for gross misconduct in the field...

476
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:17,911
...I sentence you to
summary liquidation.

477
01:08:18,786 --> 01:08:20,014
Liquidation?

478
01:08:21,422 --> 01:08:23,083
Just die.

479
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:34,959
Take the body to the surface.
Bring me the stats on Program Alice...

480
01:08:35,169 --> 01:08:36,602
Sir!

481
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:02,995
Good thing we like a challenge.

482
01:09:21,549 --> 01:09:23,073
Hold on.

483
01:09:23,751 --> 01:09:25,309
Hold on.

484
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:28,780
They have the anti-virus in there.

485
01:09:28,989 --> 01:09:30,684
Just hold on.

486
01:09:31,825 --> 01:09:33,520
It's too late, and you know it.

487
01:09:35,963 --> 01:09:39,262
Besides, you need a way
to get in there.

488
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,490
And I have an idea.

489
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:58,211
- You keep them safe, huh?
- You got it.

490
01:10:05,059 --> 01:10:06,424
Come here.

491
01:10:24,044 --> 01:10:25,477
Carlos, I...

492
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:27,541
Save it.

493
01:10:32,686 --> 01:10:35,280
You just promise me one thing.

494
01:10:36,056 --> 01:10:38,286
When you get down there...

495
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,385
Consider it done.

496
01:11:41,655 --> 01:11:43,680
Wish I had a smoke.

497
01:12:08,716 --> 01:12:10,081
Fuck!

498
01:12:24,365 --> 01:12:26,299
I'll be damned.

499
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:29,298
L.J., you sneaky son of a bitch.

500
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:38,068
Oh, hell.

501
01:12:41,548 --> 01:12:43,140
Come on.

502
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:34,795
Get the kids out quickly!

503
01:13:35,002 --> 01:13:36,435
Go!

504
01:13:40,874 --> 01:13:42,603
- Run! Run! Hurry up!
- Okay.

505
01:13:42,810 --> 01:13:44,004
Go! Go! Go!

506
01:13:46,113 --> 01:13:47,705
Take him!

507
01:13:53,187 --> 01:13:54,677
You're not coming?

508
01:13:56,056 --> 01:13:57,489
Take care of the others.

509
01:17:22,195 --> 01:17:24,720
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.

510
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:28,894
- I am the artificial intelligence...
- I know what you are.

511
01:17:29,102 --> 01:17:30,694
I knew your sister.

512
01:17:30,904 --> 01:17:32,895
She was a homicidal bitch.

513
01:17:33,273 --> 01:17:36,208
My sister computer was merely
following the most logical path...

514
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:38,207
...for the preservation of human life.

515
01:17:38,412 --> 01:17:40,539
Yeah. Kill a few, save a lot.

516
01:17:41,515 --> 01:17:42,846
So, what happened here?

517
01:17:43,050 --> 01:17:46,816
Dr. Isaacs returned in an infected
state. He was bitten by a creature...

518
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:49,648
...that had been treated
with a newly developed serum.

519
01:17:49,856 --> 01:17:52,051
A serum derived from your blood.

520
01:17:52,993 --> 01:17:55,826
The resulting infection
has caused massive mutation.

521
01:17:58,932 --> 01:17:59,921
My blood?

522
01:18:00,133 --> 01:18:01,998
Your blood has bonded
with the T-virus.

523
01:18:02,202 --> 01:18:03,726
Dr. Isaacs correctly deduced...

524
01:18:03,937 --> 01:18:07,839
...that it could be used
to destroy the biohazard for good.

525
01:18:08,241 --> 01:18:11,438
You mean my blood
is the cure for all this?

526
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:13,112
Correct.

527
01:18:13,747 --> 01:18:15,442
So why are you helping me?

528
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:18,584
Your blood is pure,
and this facility contains...

529
01:18:18,785 --> 01:18:22,050
...all of the equipment you will require
to synthesize a cure.

530
01:18:24,591 --> 01:18:27,788
- You mean this could all end?
- Correct.

531
01:18:28,161 --> 01:18:29,389
There is, however...

532
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:32,298
...a small problem.

533
01:18:38,739 --> 01:18:40,900
<i>I have him contained</i>
<i>in the lower levels...</i>

534
01:18:41,108 --> 01:18:43,838
<i>... but I cannot hold him there</i>
<i>for much longer.</i>

535
01:18:46,913 --> 01:18:47,971
All right, let's go.

536
01:18:59,726 --> 01:19:01,057
<i>Alice?</i>

537
01:19:01,962 --> 01:19:03,293
<i>Good luck.</i>

538
01:23:10,243 --> 01:23:12,473
You can't kill me.

539
01:24:01,094 --> 01:24:02,254
I've told you...

540
01:24:02,695 --> 01:24:04,890
...I can't die.

541
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:28,282
No.

542
01:24:52,979 --> 01:24:55,812
For so long, I thought
you were the future.

543
01:24:56,616 --> 01:24:58,140
I was wrong.

544
01:24:58,618 --> 01:25:01,348
I am the future.

545
01:25:07,861 --> 01:25:09,294
No.

546
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:11,891
You're just...

547
01:25:12,098 --> 01:25:14,066
...another asshole.

548
01:25:16,936 --> 01:25:19,370
And we're both gonna die
down here.

549
01:25:41,594 --> 01:25:43,892
Yeah, you're the future, all right.

550
01:26:18,798 --> 01:26:23,030
All attempts to contact the North
American facility continue to fail.

551
01:26:23,403 --> 01:26:25,337
How long have they been off the air?

552
01:26:25,538 --> 01:26:27,472
Seventeen hours.

553
01:26:27,674 --> 01:26:31,041
We must consider them lost.
But our plans remain unchanged.

554
01:26:31,244 --> 01:26:33,439
All data will be transferred
to this facility...

555
01:26:33,646 --> 01:26:37,047
...and the research will continue
under my personal supervision.

556
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:39,718
I expect results within one month.

557
01:26:39,919 --> 01:26:41,887
You won't have to wait that long, boys.

558
01:26:42,522 --> 01:26:44,285
Because I'm coming for you.

559
01:26:44,624 --> 01:26:45,682
And...

560
01:26:46,292 --> 01:26:48,954
...l'm gonna be bringing
a few of my friends.

561
01:33:51,584 --> 01:33:53,211
<i>You're just...</i>

562
01:33:53,419 --> 01:33:55,717
<i>... another asshole.</i>
