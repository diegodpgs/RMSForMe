1
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,397
- Mr. Mills, how are you?
- I'm fine.

2
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:46,611
- How are you?
- Fine.

3
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,367
- I suppose you wanna see it again?
- If you don't mind.

4
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,079
- You know where it is.
- Oh, yeah.

5
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:55,662
If I charged you a dollar every time
you came to examine the machine...

6
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,828
...you'd probably own it.
It's the one all the pros use.

7
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,543
Mariah Carey. Beyoncé. Gwen Stefani.

8
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:03,878
Really? Who's Beyoncé?

9
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,589
Just kidding. I'll take it.

10
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,200
Excuse me, sir. The adult
party's in the front.

11
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,916
- I'm Kim's father. Excuse
me, I work for her father.

12
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:44,173
- Her real father.
- It's okay, Cyril. I got it.

13
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,425
- Hello, Bryan.
- Lenore.

14
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,341
I just wanted to give Kim her present.

15
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,381
We're letting the kids have their space.

16
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:55,517
- Put it with the others.
- I wanna give it to her myself.

17
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:58,850
- Still having trouble following the rules.
- Oh, come on, Lennie.

18
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,061
- I've asked you not to call me that.
- Excuse me. Lenore.

19
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:03,726
Dad! Oh, my darling.

20
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,519
- Hi.
- Hello, my sweet.

21
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,147
- Happy birthday.
- I was telling your father...

22
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,907
- ... how we arranged the presents.
- Here.

23
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,864
It's bad manners to open the one...

24
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,903
...and not the others. Go on. Open it.

25
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,537
- Cool.
- A karaoke machine?

26
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,000
- Well, I figured she wants to be a singer.
- When she was 12, Bryan.

27
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,630
- We've moved on.
- Thank you, Daddy.

28
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,462
Oh. My pleasure.

29
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,673
- I still wanna be a singer. Don't tell Mom. 
- You got it.

30
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,634
Here. One for the book.

31
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,595
- We have a professional photographer.
- Big smile, sweetie.

32
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,176
That's my girl.

33
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,187
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

34
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,151
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

35
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,565
Oh, my... Stuart!

36
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,322
Stuart, I love you! I
love you! I love you!

37
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,327
Happy birthday, sweetie.

38
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,926
- Oh, Stuart, you're impossible.
- I know.

39
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,711
- Hey, Bryan.
- Stuart.

40
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,430
She's not a little girl anymore, huh?

41
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,717
- I guess not.
- Will you join us for lunch?

42
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,977
No, thanks.

43
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:23,105
I just wanted to be here to
wish her a happy birthday.

44
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,308
- Good to see you, Bryan.
- You too.

45
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,207
Thanks.

46
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,036
- Hey.
- Hey.

47
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,868
You forgot.

48
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:24,829
Come on in.

49
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,291
It's not like I didn't call to
remind you. Third Saturday in May?

50
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,957
- Red meat, red wine? Sound familiar?
- He probably had a lot on his mind.

51
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:35,252
Yeah, the busy life of a retiree.
Every day a new adventure.

52
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,843
What does a retiree do, anyway? 
Take naps? Play golf?

53
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,508
- Hit on rich widows?
- That takes care of the morning.

54
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,178
Yeah, well, come on, guys.
You know why I'm here.

55
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,937
Yeah, how's that going?

56
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,939
Okay. We had her birthday today.

57
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,600
Can you believe my Kimmy's 17?

58
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,565
- Whoa.
- Seventeen?

59
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,280
- To Kim.
- Lennie still got a hard-on for you?

60
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,451
She's not Lennie anymore. She's Lenore.

61
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,202
Oh, she's still got a hard-on.

62
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,784
- And the husband?
- The same. Perfect.

63
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:07,542
- Dig deep enough, there's always
shit. We can dig if you want us to dig.

64
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,454
What, you think he hasn't done it
already? Mr. Attention-to-Detail.

65
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,463
- Thank you, Bernie.
- How's Kimmy?

66
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,465
Good. She's good.

67
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,752
Yeah? She sleep over yet?

68
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,463
Well, let's say we're working on it.

69
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:23,183
She appreciate the fact that
you've given up your life...

70
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,764
...in order to be closer to her?

71
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,975
Heh. What a life, huh?

72
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,062
Hey, remember Beirut after
the chief disappeared?

73
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,818
Bry was in deep with that
crazy sheik from Hezbollah?

74
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,321
The guy said he'd get us
inside then disappeared.

75
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,356
We're scrambling to get the hell out...

76
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,742
...before we get taken
down and where are you?

77
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,778
I promised never to miss her birthday.

78
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,038
Yeah, that went down well at Langley...

79
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,324
...when they found out
you flew the coop...

80
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,289
...to attend your child's
birthday 9000 miles away.

81
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,587
Where did you say your
next posting was after that?

82
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,295
The Arctic Circle spying on
penguins, I believe it was.

83
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,130
No, penguins live in Antarctica.

84
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,761
Actually, it was Alaska.
What's your point, Sam?

85
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,346
My point is we have an open
space. Say the word, it's yours.

86
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,061
Who likes theirs rare?

87
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:09,929
- Guys.
- See you, Bryan.

88
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,349
- Good night, guys.
- See you, Bry.

89
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,609
Hey, look, look, look.
All kidding aside...

90
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,897
...it's a great thing trying to
make up for lost time with Kimmy.

91
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,940
But tomorrow's job? Right here.

92
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,733
Four hours' work, 2500 bucks...

93
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,904
...just for taking some pop
diva to and from her concert.

94
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,572
- We're one short.
- A singer?

95
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,787
I don't know if you'd call her
a singer. More like a cash cow.

96
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,874
Twenty million records sold
already and she's not even 25.

97
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,288
Job's a piece of cake.

98
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,628
We get her there and back. Inside,
they've got their own people.

99
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,919
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay?

100
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,177
- Yeah.
- Like that's it?

101
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:42,553
Yeah.

102
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:46,467
- It'll be perfect. Just like old times.
- Better. No one gets killed.

103
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:50,096
Tomorrow. Good night, guys. See you.

104
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,606
Get in the back, Wendy.
I always get in the back.

105
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,550
Ma'am, if you don't mind,
I suggest you keep moving.

106
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,806
My mother is ma'am, if you don't mind.

107
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:32,137
- Come on, it's time now. Let's go.
- Okay.

108
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:36,399
Bernie, Casey, you're out
here. Bry, you're in the room.

109
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,151
Okay.

110
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,989
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

111
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,024
Thank you for coming.

112
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,040
Wow, it was beautiful.

113
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,217
Thanks. What did you
say your name was again?

114
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,969
Mills. Bryan Mills.

115
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,802
- Nice to meet you, Bryan Mills.
- You too.

116
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:11,886
- You're on. Come on, let's go now.
- Okay, guys.

117
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,350
Excuse me, miss. I know
this isn't the right time.

118
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,355
I have a daughter who
wants to be a singer...

119
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,767
...and was wondering
if you had any tips.

120
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,526
Yeah, I do.

121
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,858
Tell her to pick another career.

122
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,860
I got one. We're waiting
on an air strike...

123
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,778
...and we're waiting and
then my satellite phone rings.

124
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,284
- Who is it?
- Hello?

125
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,245
- The guy we're to terminate.
- Honey.

126
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,250
He'd like to know if we want some tea.

127
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,456
Sorry, guys, it's Kim.

128
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,002
The noise?

129
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,258
I'm at a concert.

130
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,469
You know this song? Yeah?

131
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:49,802
Yep, that's her. No, no,
no, I'm not attending.

132
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,432
I'm... I'm not attending.

133
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,219
I'm helping some friends
out with security.

134
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,433
Well, of course I met her.

135
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,269
Who do you think's guarding her?

136
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,604
I'm glad you're impressed.

137
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,020
Hey, I'm happy you called.

138
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:06,440
I'm happy you called. What?

139
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,950
Lunch? Tomorrow?

140
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,742
Sure, sure. I know the place.

141
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,157
Twelve-thirty it is.

142
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,287
I'll see you then.

143
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,669
Here he is. And...? What happened?

144
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,671
She wants to have lunch. Okay.

145
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,049
- Just the two of us.
All right. Fantastic.

146
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,959
See? There's progress. That's great.

147
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:42,901
Who left that gate open? Bry, get
her out of here. Take the lead.

148
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,151
Move! Go, go!

149
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,906
More security here now!

150
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,691
That's it. Move.

151
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,199
Casey!

152
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,995
Bernie, stand by, stand by.

153
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,256
- Go, go, go.
- Watch your head.

154
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,801
Here, take this. The sugar will
take the edge off the shock.

155
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,261
Come on, come on, drink some more.

156
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,276
It's okay. It's okay. You're safe.

157
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,742
You're safe now.

158
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,405
Bernie.

159
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,539
Casey. Rambo.

160
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,084
Seriously, Bry, you should
think about coming with us.

161
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,837
You've got the edge. There's
more of this to be had.

162
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,919
- She's going to college next year?
- Yep.

163
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:50,176
- You're gonna lose her.
- That gives me a year to find her.

164
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,763
Mr. Mills, she'd like to see you.

165
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,851
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

166
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,500
So your daughter wants to be a singer?

167
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:010,300
Yep, since she was 5.

168
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,600
You know, it's not what everyone thinks it is.

169
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:17,500
Once the glam wears off, it's just a
lot of hotel rooms, lots of airports.

170
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,500
That's what she wants.

171
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,400
The first number is Gio, my vocal coach.

172
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,600
If he says she can sing, she can sing.

173
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,300
He'll give her coaching
she needs, the fee is on me.

174
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,700
The second number is my manager.

175
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,762
If Gio clears her, he'll
make sure she gets a shot.

176
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:41,060
- Thank you.
- No, Mr. Mills, thank you.

177
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,575
- There she is.
- Dad.

178
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,800
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hey.

179
00:13:06,576 --> 00:13:07,500
- Hi.
- Hi.

180
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,300
Don't look so excited.

181
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,900
I was just surprised. I thought
it was just gonna be Kim and I.

182
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,600
I asked Mom to come.

183
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:20,500
One raspberry-banana milkshake, extra
cherries, just the way you like it.

184
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,500
- Thanks.
- Lennie... Lenore.

185
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,200
- Would you like something?
- I'm fine, thanks.

186
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,226
So?

187
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,800
So, Dad, guess what.

188
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,000
- You know my friend Amanda?
- Yep.

189
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,800
Her cousins asked us to spend
vacation with them in Paris.

190
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,600
How cool is that?

191
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,500
- Why do you want to go to Paris?
- Dad. Hello?

192
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,284
The Louvre, the Impressionist
museum, the Picasso Museum.

193
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,800
I didn't know you were so into art.

194
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,538
Are you kidding? I've been to
the MOMA, like, a hundred times.

195
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:51,457
Amanda went to France last summer and when she
came back she could practically speak French.

196
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,343
And because you're under 18...

197
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,345
...you need my permission
to leave the country?

198
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:02,346
Dad, please. I really, really wanna go.

199
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,352
They've got this like sick
apartment overlooking the river.

200
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,980
- Just you and Amanda?
- And her cousins.

201
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,393
Don't make a big deal out of
this, Bryan. Just sign the paper.

202
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,499
- What?
- I'm not comfortable with this.

203
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,900
- Dad.
- I know the world, sweetie.

204
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,199
- Dad, please. 
- I don't think a 17-year-old should be travelling alone.

205
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,499
- I'm not gonna be alone.
- Two 17-year-olds.

206
00:14:27,657 --> 00:14:28,659
Amanda's 19.

207
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:37,399
How about this? How about if I go along?

208
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,503
You won't know I'm there. I'm
very good at being invisible.

209
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,262
As you so amply demonstrated
for most of her life.

210
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,017
Just sign the paper, Bryan.

211
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,930
I'll think about it.

212
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,500
Everyone at this table
knows what that means.

213
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,736
Hey, Kimmy, there's something else.

214
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,523
- I don't want anything else.
- Kim.

215
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,100
- I don't get you.
- What?

216
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,955
You sacrificed our marriage
in the service of the country.

217
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,871
You made a mess of your life
in service of your country.

218
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,299
Can't you sacrifice a little
this one time for your own daughter?

219
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,919
- I would sacrifice anything for her.
- Then what's your problem?

220
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,385
I'm not comfortable
putting my daughter at risk.

221
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:26,555
Putting our daughter at
risk by going to Paris?

222
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,012
You're pathetic.

223
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:47,201
- She's coming.
- Thanks.

224
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,497
Three conditions.

225
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:54,500
The address and phone number
of where you're staying.

226
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,632
You move, I wanna know where
and with whom you'll be staying.

227
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,385
Call me when you land. Call me
every night before you go to sleep.

228
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,296
It's international. My number is in.

229
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,591
- Okay, awesome.
- Kimmy, you're not focused.

230
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,053
- I am.
- What did I say?

231
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:10,561
You said call you when I land,
every night before I go to sleep...

232
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,564
...your phone's international,
the number's programmed in.

233
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:16,897
Okay, one last thing. I get
to take you to the airport.

234
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,561
Okay.

235
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,322
- There you go.
- Yes.

236
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,826
Thank you, Daddy. Thank
you, thank you, thank you.

237
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,702
Mom!

238
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:29,785
I love you, Dad.

239
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,994
Morn, he signed it, he signed
it. I'm gonna go call Amanda!

240
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,507
Wouldn't it have been easier
to sign the first time?

241
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,296
Wouldn't it have been easier if
you and I had talked about it first?

242
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:51,477
Certain areas in Paris you should
avoid. I've written them down.

243
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:52,888
- Dad.
- Come on, take it.

244
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:56,854
We're gonna be spending 90 percent
of our time in museums. Don't worry.

245
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,735
That's like telling water
not to be wet, sweetie.

246
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,938
Mom says your job made you paranoid.

247
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,822
Well, my job made me aware.

248
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:09,036
I used to ask Mom what your job
was that you were away all the time.

249
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,539
And she would tell me to ask you.

250
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:15,327
Whenever I did see you,
I was afraid to ask.

251
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,245
Yeah? Why?

252
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,919
I don't know. Maybe because...

253
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,752
...I was afraid to find out.

254
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,759
Like, maybe it was
something I wouldn't like.

255
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,263
I worked for the
government. You knew that.

256
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:36,014
So you were like a spy, right?

257
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,650
- What happens if I push this button?
- Don't touch that button.

258
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:45,699
Well, no, I was a... I
was a preventer, actually.

259
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,699
- A preventer?
- Yeah.

260
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,035
What did you prevent?

261
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,196
Bad things from happening.

262
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:56,785
So it was a good job?

263
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,750
Yes. Yep, it was.

264
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,716
Do you miss it?

265
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:05,544
I missed you more.

266
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,939
- Kim!
- Dad, there's Amanda.

267
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,945
Go ahead. I'll get the bags.

268
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,383
- Jimmy'll give you a hand with those.
- I can manage.

269
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,967
Lenore.

270
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,974
Do you know about this?
She's not just going to Paris.

271
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,306
- I know.
- She lied to me.

272
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,642
Yes, because she can't
be honest with you.

273
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,898
Why? What are you talking about?

274
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,730
Your rules and conditions.

275
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,189
What is this?

276
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:07,105
It's U2's European tour dates.

277
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,273
She's following a rock
band around Europe?

278
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,161
All kids do. Stuart got her tickets,
arranged her to stay in the best hotels.

279
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,493
Best hotels. You know, you live
in your little bubble here...

280
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:20,035
...behind your wall, with your
maids and chauffeurs and servants.

281
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:21,703
No idea what the world is like.

282
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:25,669
Yes, and neither will she unless
she goes out and experiences it.

283
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,794
Don't tell me I don't know the world.

284
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,931
For five years I waited for a phone call
that didn't come for weeks at a time.

285
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,139
For a knock on the door telling
me there'd be no calls anymore.

286
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:45,352
Listen, I know you moved here to build
some sort of relationship with Kimmy.

287
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,362
But you're not gonna do
that by smothering her.

288
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:52,071
Let her live, or I promise,
I promise you'll lose her.

289
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:00,120
Girls.

290
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:06,918
Kim!

291
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,925
I love you.

292
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,096
Let's go. Come on.

293
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,064
I'll teach you the French words I know.

294
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,825
- Which may not be that much, but...
- Okay. Yeah, right.

295
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,828
Three. Okay, now take one...

296
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,959
Need some help? One with the two of you?

297
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,461
Yes, please.

298
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,668
- Okay.
- He's really cute.

299
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,584
Okay. Yeah, great. Very nice.

300
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:52,798
Where are you from?

301
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:55,012
California.

302
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:01,977
No. I'm Peter.

303
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,651
- This is Kim.
- Hi.

304
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,982
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

305
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,613
Hey.

306
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:13,898
You're going into Paris?

307
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,369
You know, taxis here
are so damned expensive.

308
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,699
Want to share?

309
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,660
Yeah. Sure. Okay, perfect.

310
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,665
Thanks.

311
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:28,796
<i>To check arrivals, please press one.</i>

312
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,457
<i>Please enter the flight number.</i>

313
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:37,005
<i>Flight 288 arrived in
Paris Charles de Gaulle...</i>

314
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:40,721
<i>...at 8 a. m. local time.</i>

315
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,348
Yeah.

316
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:46,014
Oh, are you serious?

317
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,478
Oh, my God. Nice address.

318
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,018
Oh, yeah, thanks.

319
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:54,314
It's my cousins', but they're in Madrid,
so we have the whole place to ourselves.

320
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,073
- How cool is that?
- Wow.

321
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,860
- I didn't know that.
- It's no biggie.

322
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,074
Well, I have to be going.

323
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,955
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, okay.

324
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,205
- You too.
- Bye.

325
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,367
Hey.

326
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,958
There is a party tonight
at school. Want to come?

327
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,872
- Sure. Yeah.
- We don't even know him.

328
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,258
What is there to know? He's hot.

329
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,544
I come pick you up around 9?
- Okay, yeah.

330
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,758
Okay, great. Your apartment?

331
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:22,516
- It's the whole fifth floor. Hoffmann.
- Okay. See you tonight. Bye.

332
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,302
Bye.

333
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:33,818
Yeah.

334
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:38,650
Fifth floor. Two girls around 18.

335
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,029
Oh, my God.

336
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:46,324
- How sick is this?
- Are you kidding me? It's great.

337
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,369
I just wish you would've told
me they weren't gonna be here.

338
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,209
- What's the difference?
- I told my dad they'd be here.

339
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,669
You told your dad you
were going to museums too.

340
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,675
Oh, come on. He's not gonna know.

341
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,670
- I'm gonna sleep with him.
- Who?

342
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,339
- Peter.
- You just met him.

343
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,885
I hear French guys are amazing in bed.

344
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,428
- Maybe he has a friend, huh?
- No.

345
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:08,812
- No.
- Oh, come on.

346
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:12,851
You gotta lose it sometime.
Might as well be in Paris.

347
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,239
Hey!

348
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,427
- Amanda, where's the bathroom?
- What?

349
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:41,678
I have to pee!

350
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,915
- Hello?
- It's me. Has Kim called you?

351
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:14,913
Bryan, she's 17. She's in
Paris. Give her some space.

352
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,377
<i>She'll call. Take a sleeping pill.</i>

353
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,667
Have a drink or something. Good night.

354
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,461
Good night.

355
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,652
Hi, Daddy.

356
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,402
Kim.

357
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:46,490
What did I say? You
were supposed to call me.

358
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:47,699
I'm sorry.

359
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:50,114
<i>I thought something was
wrong with the phone.</i>

360
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,999
- No. It was such a rush at the airport.
- All right.

361
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,832
Well, if I'd had the number
where you were staying...

362
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,668
<i>...I would've just called there.</i>

363
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,922
<i>What's the number?</i>

364
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,675
<i>- I don't have it.
- Kimmy, come on.</i>

365
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,633
<i>This is one of the conditions.
Let me talk to the cousins.</i>

366
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,468
<i>I'll get it from them.</i>

367
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:10,305
Dad, they're in Spain.
I didn't know. I swear.

368
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,553
To Spain?

369
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:17,266
Kim, is there anything
else you want to tell me?

370
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,567
Kimmy.

371
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,529
- There's someone here.
- The cousins are back?

372
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,447
No.

373
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,662
- Oh, my God. They got Amanda.
- What?

374
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,415
<i>What are you talking about? Kimmy?</i>

375
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:38,830
- Dad.
- Kim.

376
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,754
- Kim.
- Dad. They took her.

377
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,214
<i>- They took her.
- All right, listen to me.</i>

378
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,845
Oh, God.

379
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,632
- Did you meet anyone on the plane?
- No.

380
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,847
- In the airport?
- No. Yes, Peter.

381
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,683
<i>- Peter? Peter who?
- I don't know.</i>

382
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:56,017
- An American?
- No.

383
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,228
Did he know where you were staying?

384
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,892
He took a cab with us.

385
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:05,573
Dad, they're coming.

386
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,780
- Please, I'm scared.
- I know you are.

387
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,320
Stay focused, Kimmy. You
have to hold it together.

388
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,034
How many people are there?

389
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,700
- Three, four. I don't know.
- Where are you?

390
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:19,795
- I'm in the bathroom.
- Go to the next bedroom.

391
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,672
Get under the bed. Tell
me when you're there.

392
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:34,510
- I'm here.
- Now, the next part is very important.

393
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:41,685
They are going to take you. Kim,
stay focused, baby. This is key.

394
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,320
You will have five, maybe ten
seconds. Very important seconds.

395
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:48,024
<i>Leave the phone on the floor. Concentrate.</i>

396
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:52,240
Shout out everything you see about them.
Hair color, eye color, tall, short, scars.

397
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,780
Anything you see. You understand?

398
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,207
They're there. I can hear them.

399
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,212
<i>Remember, concentrate.</i>

400
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:17,102
Put the phone closer so I can hear.

401
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:45,381
They're leaving. I think they're...

402
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:54,223
<i>Beard. Six feet. Tattoo
right hand, moon and star.</i>

403
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,321
I don't know who you are.

404
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,791
I don't know what you want.

405
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:24,874
If you are looking for a ransom,
I can tell you, I don't have money.

406
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:29,463
But what I do have are a
very particular set of skills.

407
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,469
Skills I've acquired
over a very long career.

408
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:36,474
Skills that make me a
nightmare for people like you.

409
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:40,394
If you let my daughter go
now, that'll be the end of it.

410
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:44,432
I will not look for you.
I will not pursue you.

411
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:48,398
But if you don't, I will look for you.

412
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,313
I will find you...

413
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,824
...and I Will kill you.

414
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,621
<i>Good luck.</i>

415
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,005
Sam, it's me. I need a favor.

416
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:17,264
I'm gonna download something.
I need it analyzed. Right now.

417
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,633
- She's been taken.
- What?

418
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,144
- Any enemies overseas?
- Why would I have enemies?

419
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:25,226
You do business overseas through
multiple shell corporations.

420
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:29,019
You were involved in an oil deal with
a bunch of Russians that went south.

421
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,983
How do you know that?
- I was not gonna let my daughter...

422
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,989
...live with someone without
knowing everything about them.

423
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:38,322
- I have a few resources...
- Now is not the time for dick measuring.

424
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,658
- Anyone looking to hurt you?
- Not that I know.

425
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:42,789
Which room's Kim's? What happened?

426
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:46,452
I got a call from her. There were
people in the apartment. She was taken.

427
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,995
- Oh, God.
- Which one?

428
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,788
That one.

429
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:55,799
Is there something I should be doing?

430
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,885
You have a lease agreement with
NetJet through your company.

431
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,594
I do.

432
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:02,968
- Get me a plane to Paris.
- For when?

433
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,261
An hour ago.

434
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:06,021
I'm gonna make the call. You all right?

435
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,852
Yeah, yeah. I'm okay.

436
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:19,990
Would you please get
her back to me, Bryan?

437
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:21,911
First I have to find her.

438
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,793
Sam, what have you got?

439
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,204
<i>SAM". They're speaking Albanian.</i>

440
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,795
Based on their accents and
dialects, they must be from Tropoja.

441
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,800
<i>The place is ground zero for scummers.</i>

442
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,212
<i>Even the Russians give
these guys a wide berth.</i>

443
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,181
The one you spoke to, his name is Marko.

444
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,342
We have information
that a mobster boss...

445
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,728
...by the name of Marko Hoxha
moved to Paris about six months ago.

446
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:52,644
<i>If he's the one, he's a big fish.
The tattoo, by the way, is a group ID.</i>

447
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:55,733
<i>- Am I on speaker or are you by yourself?
- Lenore is here.</i>

448
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:59,153
- Hey, Lennie.
- Hello, Sam.

449
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:00,735
She needs to hear it, Sam.

450
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:05,701
The specialty of the groups coming out
of this area is trafficking in women.

451
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:11,499
- Keep going.
- Okay.

452
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:16,462
Their previous m. o. was to offer women
from emerging East European countries...

453
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:20,675
<i>...like Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria,
jobs in the West as maids and nannies.</i>

454
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:25,308
Once smuggled in, they'd addict them
to drugs and turn them into prostitutes.

455
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,684
Lately, however, they've decided
that it's more economical...

456
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:34,727
...just to kidnap traveling young
women. Saves on transportation costs.

457
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,316
Oh, my little baby.

458
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,026
What else?

459
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:42,326
Based on the way these groups
operate, our analyst says...

460
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:45,328
...you have a 96-hour window
from the time she was grabbed.

461
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,956
- To what?
- To never finding her.

462
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:51,210
No,no,no.

463
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:53,041
Daddy!

464
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:57,500
<i>Mustache. Six feet. Tattoo
on right hand, moon and star.</i>

465
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,339
Da...

466
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:08,135
<i>Good luck.</i>

467
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,730
<i>Good luck.</i>

468
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:15,935
<i>Good luck.</i>

469
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:18,813
<i>Good luck.</i>

470
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,496
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

471
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,466
<i>Dad, they got Amanda.</i>

472
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,180
Oh, God.

473
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:19,646
<i>Dad, they got her.</i>

474
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,607
<i>They took her.</i>

475
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,444
<i>Go to the next bedroom.
Get under the bed.</i>

476
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:29,610
<i>Tell me when you're there. I'm here.</i>

477
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:38,536
<i>Stay focused, baby. Leave
the phone on the ï¬‚oor.</i>

478
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:41,205
<i>Concentrate. Shout out
everything you see about them.</i>

479
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:45,251
<i>Hair color, eye color, tall, short,
scars. Anything you see. You understand?</i>

480
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,387
<i>They're there. I can hear
them. Remember, concentrate.</i>

481
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:04,520
<i>They're leaving. Daddy!</i>

482
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:08,694
<i>Dad!</i>

483
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:13,074
Beard. Six feet. Tattoo
right hand, moon and star.

484
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:14,871
Dad!

485
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:39,122
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

486
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,910
<i>Flight DU 720 from Stockholm...</i>

487
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:46,668
<i>...arrives at Gate 16.</i>

488
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:57,799
- Hi.
- Hi.

489
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:59,593
- I'm Peter.
- I'm Ingrid.

490
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,056
- On holidays?
- Yes.

491
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,937
- Me too.
- Cool.

492
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:05,565
Cabs here are so damned
expensive. Want to share?

493
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:08,068
- Sure. Why not?
- Great.

494
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,280
- Excuse me.
- Hey.

495
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,158
- Hey.
- Drive.

496
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:21,411
- The two American girls from yesterday?
- I don't know.

497
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:26,245
The next rib drives into your lungs.
The two American girls, where are they?

498
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,002
- Just like the old days.
- Would you have it any other way?

499
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,628
Between you and me? No.

500
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:36,132
But now that I sit behind a
desk, the world looks different.

501
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,589
- You mean, looks boring.
- I mean different.

502
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:43,132
Okay, a little boring. But is
being retired any more interesting?

503
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:46,677
It wasn't. Until my daughter
disappeared in Paris yesterday.

504
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:50,814
She and her friend were marked by a
spotter at the airport. Albanians took her.

505
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:53,270
- How do you know this?
- I'm retired, not dead.

506
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,186
And I assume you don't
want to go to the police.

507
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:59,151
I was told I have 96 hours.
That was 16 hours ago.

508
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:03,239
- Okay, first, we should find the spotter.
- I found him, he's dead.

509
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:08,038
You found him that way?

510
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:14,083
Bryan, you cannot just run
around tearing down Paris...

511
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,418
I'll tear down the
Eiffel Tower if I have to.

512
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,255
- Don't forget who you talk to.
- Thought I was talking to a friend.

513
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:24,514
You are. But please remember,
your friend has a desk now.

514
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:28,176
"Deputy director, Internal
Security. " Very impressive.

515
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:30,311
The Albanians?

516
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,397
They showed up from the
East, six, seven years ago.

517
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,934
Fifteen, twenty of them.
Now there are hundreds.

518
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,819
We don't even know how
many. And dangerous.

519
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,697
So I heard. Where do I find them?

520
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:48,156
The best place to start is Porte de
Clichy. Bryan, try not to make a mess.

521
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,535
I need you to tail someone.

522
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:13,017
So Little Red Riding
Hood says to the Wolf:

523
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,477
Grandma! What strong arms you have!

524
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,983
And the Wolf replies...

525
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,393
Your assistant.

526
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:21,066
- Here.
- Thanks.

527
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:24,945
Yes?

528
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:27,702
<i>He visited a temp
agency and hired a car.</i>

529
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:30,242
<i>- That's all?
- Yeah, it's quiet.</i>

530
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,116
Not for long. Don't let him kid you.

531
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,103
- Gregor Milocivic?
- Yes. Yes, I am Gregor.

532
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:56,606
I'm Mr. Smith. Get in.

533
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:02,691
Here is my resume.

534
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:05,653
The employment agency said we
would be doing translations.

535
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:08,785
Yes. Albanian to English.
You do speak Albanian?

536
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:12,072
Albanian, Serbian, Croatian. I
was a teacher in primary school...

537
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,991
- ... before the war began in Pristina...
- What's your rate?

538
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:16,455
My rate?

539
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:19,791
It is 25 per hour for the first
three hours and then it goes up...

540
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:23,754
Okay. Now, here's for
10 hours. Wait here.

541
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:28,380
Mr. Smith, I do not understand.
What is the job exactly?

542
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,890
Right now the job is to wait here.

543
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,353
Good evening.

544
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:44,566
- Hi. Looking for a date?
- I love your dress. Is that silk?

545
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,981
I don't know. You want
to know the prices?

546
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:49,025
Just the way it falls, it must be silk.

547
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:52,537
How it compliments the
natural curves of your body.

548
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,789
The rate is 40 euros for the standard.

549
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,745
Standard? Could you be more specific?

550
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:59,582
Back home, the standard covers
a range of possibilities.

551
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:02,122
Like kissing, you know,
closed lips, open lips.

552
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:05,292
- If you're not buying, piss off.
- I didn't say I wasn't buying.

553
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:07,586
I like to get comfortable
before I purchase.

554
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:09,629
Like this karaoke machine I bought.

555
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:13,471
I must have read that manual
from cover to cover so many times.

556
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:17,103
I don't give a shit. You're gonna
get me in trouble if you don't buy.

557
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,480
- Trouble? Really? With who?
- Piss off.

558
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:22,313
Okay, okay. Listen, I'm sorry.

559
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:25,729
If I want a package
deal, do I get a discount?

560
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,615
- You cost me two now.
- My name's Bryan.

561
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,535
- Oh, God. You better leave.
- I thought we were negotiating.

562
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:36,247
Anton, I swear, it's not my fault.

563
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:39,249
- I told him...
- Why are you bothering the girl?

564
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,752
- None of your business.
- She is my business.

565
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:44,539
And if you're not spending
money, you're costing money.

566
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:47,504
- I was negotiating.
- No negotiating. Price is the price.

567
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:49,590
Now you owe me for two that got away.

568
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,971
I don't owe you nothing.

569
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:56,680
- Fifty euros or I kick your ass.
- Sure, sure, okay.

570
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:58,595
Chill.

571
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:04,521
Okay. Here's your 50.

572
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:09,318
And another 50 for being an asshole.
Now get the hell out of here.

573
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,199
If I see you again, I'll kill you.

574
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:21,956
Mr. Smith, I do not know what kind of
job I'm supposed to do for you, but...

575
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:25,088
- You are to translate.
- Yes. But translate what?

576
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:27,123
This.

577
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,848
Translate.

578
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:39,470
- They're talking about you.
- What about me?

579
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:42,309
- They're not saying nice things.
- Be specific.

580
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:45,941
They're saying... Excuse me, Mr.
Smith... what an asshole you are.

581
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,188
Please, if you can explain
to me why we're doing this...

582
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,027
Just translate.

583
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:55,030
One of them says, the
sausage gave him heartburn.

584
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:56,410
Keep going.

585
00:44:56,569 --> 00:45:01,040
The other one is suggesting something
his grandmother used to give him.

586
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:04,669
- Do you really want to hear all this?
- Every word.

587
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:09,878
Now they're talking about football.
The game between Lazio and Marseille.

588
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:11,964
And they lost money on the betting.

589
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:16,677
- Perhaps if I knew the purpose...
- You're better off not knowing.

590
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,137
Is it still football?

591
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,268
One is on the phone.

592
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,725
He has to do a job at
the construction site.

593
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:26,937
Something about fresh
merchandise giving problems.

594
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,477
Mr. Smith, I do not
understand any of this.

595
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:32,568
You're not supposed to. Goodbye.

596
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:37,619
I asked for an English-Albanian
dictionary, did you bring one?

597
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:41,076
Thank you.

598
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,345
I love you.

599
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,114
Where did you get this?

600
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:40,362
Where did you get this?

601
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:43,532
- I'm good.
- Who gave this to you?

602
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,949
- Who...? Who gave this to you?
- I'm good.

603
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:52,169
Hey.

604
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,603
Hey.

605
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:33,745
Come on.

606
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:18,705
I said he wouldn't stay quiet long.

607
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:21,336
<i>- What do we do now?
- Now, he's in action...</i>

608
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,042
...my guess is he'll lose you.

609
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:41,606
Shit!

610
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:16,183
Monsieur Allen, how are you?

611
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:18,219
Hello, Gilles. How's the wife?

612
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:19,932
Well, still in charge.

613
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,848
- Been a long time since I've seen you.
- Way too long.

614
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:25,526
- The usual accommodation?
- Plus one.

615
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:13,338
Yes?

616
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,049
<i>We need to talk.
- I'm listening.</i>

617
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:20,220
Well, can't you come and meet me first?

618
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,009
I can't see you. Where are you?

619
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:24,975
I can see you and hear you very well.

620
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:28,182
You can tell them to stop jogging now.

621
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:32,819
<i>OK. We've got the signal.</i>

622
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,446
Localizing.

623
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,232
Cross-checking transmitters.

624
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:38,617
Didn't think I was
gonna come down, did you?

625
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:41,074
I didn't think you were
gonna make such a mess.

626
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:43,284
I didn't have time to
worry about neatness.

627
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:45,449
<i>I know. You have 70 hours.</i>

628
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:46,993
Now I have 56.

629
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:47,955
Got him.

630
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,961
No, now you have none.

631
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,374
My chief wanted to arrest you,
I convinced him to send you home.

632
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:59,013
<i>Air France 001 leaves
today at 2. First class.</i>

633
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:02,175
Courtesy of the French government
for past services rendered.

634
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:08,939
- And what about my daughter?
- I told you, I sit behind a desk now.

635
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:12,476
<i>I take my orders from someone
who sits behind a bigger desk.</i>

636
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:16,318
Come on, seven dead bodies, three
in hospital, a building destroyed.

637
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,823
<i>Total chaos at the airport.</i>

638
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:21,326
He wanted your ass in chains. It's
the best I could do, I'm sorry.

639
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:24,113
Sorry doesn't cut it,
Jean-Claude. Not this time.

640
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:30,252
You can't beat the state,
Bryan. You know that.

641
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,833
I'm not trying to. I'm
trying to save my daughter.

642
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:34,711
It was a trailer, not a building.

643
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:44,350
- Locate him?
- Negative.

644
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,582
No, no, no. Leave it.

645
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:19,168
It's all right, it's fluids.

646
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,378
And medication to counteract the drugs.

647
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,467
It's all right.

648
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:27,597
Where'd you get this?

649
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,513
Where did you get this jacket?

650
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:32,935
Did you get it from her?

651
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,559
Was it from this girl?

652
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:39,526
I didn't Steal it.

653
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:43,363
- I was cold, she gave it to me.
- Where? Where did she give it to you?

654
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:47,576
- In the house.
- What house?

655
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:50,370
The house with the red door.

656
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:54,711
Sorry.

657
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:03,004
He said it was a party.

658
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:06,469
The girl who gave you
this, was she in the house?

659
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:13,264
She was nice.

660
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:14,977
I know.

661
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:17,435
She's my daughter.

662
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:25,317
I need to find this house.
Do you know where it is?

663
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:33,166
Paradise.

664
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:50,930
- Good morning.
- May I help you?

665
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:53,221
- I'm here to see your boss.
- No boss.

666
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:00,895
We're doing nothing wrong here.

667
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,238
One button, and 30
agents will be here...

668
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:06,696
...before you have time
to scratch your balls.

669
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:10,112
Stop jerking around before I
close you down for wasting my time.

670
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,369
Wait here.

671
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:31,179
You have weapon?

672
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:32,764
You're holding it.

673
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:02,831
Black, one sugar, please.

674
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:11,173
What is it you want?

675
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:14,343
I'm here to negotiate the rates.

676
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:17,763
We already negotiated
the rate with Mr. Macon.

677
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:21,103
Mr. Macon has moved to another division.

678
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,109
I'm here for the renegotiation.

679
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:30,533
Unless you think I'm being
unreasonable, let me explain ourselves.

680
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:35,614
Nice coffee. We have you under
satellite surveillance, 24 hours a day.

681
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:39,411
We hear everything you say,
we know everything you do.

682
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:42,921
Do you have any idea what it
costs just to change the angle...

683
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,584
...of the lens on a satellite orbiting
200 miles above the Earth? Huh?

684
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:48,339
And those costs have gone up.

685
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:51,722
Our costs go up, your costs
go up. It's only logical.

686
00:59:52,631 --> 00:59:55,009
By the way, which one of you is Marko?

687
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:56,973
Why do you want to know?

688
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,682
I was told Marko is in charge.

689
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,597
We are all Marko.

690
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,225
Marko from Tropoja.

691
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:04,688
We are all from Tropoja.

692
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:10,782
If that's the game you want to play,
the rate just went up 10 percent.

693
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:15,196
If you are trying to extort us because
we are immigrants, we know the law.

694
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:18,073
I'm extorting you because
you are breaking the law.

695
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,743
Which charge would you
like to be arrested for?

696
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:23,913
Drugs, kidnapping,
prostitution? Take your pick.

697
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:26,715
You come to this country,
take advantage of it...

698
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:29,968
...and think because we are
tolerant, we are weak and helpless.

699
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,008
Your arrogance offends me.

700
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,138
<i>For that, the rate went up 10 percent.</i>

701
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:38,435
Now, do you want to get down
to business or to keep playing?

702
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:42,230
- How much?
- Twenty percent.

703
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:45,188
And you have my word
it'll not go up for a year.

704
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:49,230
Give me the tin.

705
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:57,280
How do you say "sugar" in your language?

706
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:12,878
You've made a very good
investment, gentlemen.

707
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:14,178
See you in a month.

708
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:18,008
Oh.

709
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:22,308
A friend gave this to me. It's
Albanian. You mind translating it?

710
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:36,322
Good luck.

711
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:38,494
<i>Good luck. Good luck.</i>

712
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:40,451
<i>- Good luck. Good luck.
- Good luck.</i>

713
01:01:50,332 --> 01:01:52,050
You don't remember me.

714
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:54,836
We spoke on the phone two days ago.

715
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,849
I told you I would find you.

716
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:05,911
Kim.

717
01:03:20,255 --> 01:03:21,882
Amanda.

718
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:58,884
Wake up!

719
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:01,137
I need you to be focused.

720
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:06,176
Are you focused yet?

721
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:17,191
Where is this girl?

722
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,564
Where is she?

723
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:51,939
You know, we used to
outsource this kind of thing.

724
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:54,725
But what we found was the
countries we outsourced to...

725
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:58,316
...had unreliable power
grids. Very Third World.

726
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:00,822
You'd turn on a switch,
power wouldn't come on...

727
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:04,985
...and then tempers would get short.
People would resort to pulling fingernails.

728
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:07,495
Acid drips on bare skin.

729
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:10,077
The whole exercise would
become counterproductive.

730
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,913
But here, the power's stable.

731
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:14,419
Here, there's a nice, even flow.

732
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:17,877
Here, you can flip a switch
and the power stays on all day.

733
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:23,344
Where is she?

734
01:05:44,232 --> 01:05:48,203
Now, I don't have any more time
to waste, Marko from Tropoja.

735
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:50,951
Give me what I need or
this switch'll stay on...

736
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:54,118
...till they turn power off
for lack of payment on the bill.

737
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:56,620
Where is my daughter?

738
01:05:57,162 --> 01:06:00,632
We don't keep virgins, we sell them.

739
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:03,005
She was virgin, lot of money.

740
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:05,341
You sold my daughter? You sold her?

741
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:08,965
To who?

742
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:11,301
I don't know.

743
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:15,638
- What? -
Saint-Clair.

744
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:17,186
Saint-Clair.

745
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:20,193
Saint-Clair? Saint-Clair.
Is that a person, a place?

746
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:24,818
Person. Patrice Saint-Clair.

747
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,028
Patrice Saint-Clair.

748
01:06:27,192 --> 01:06:28,535
Where can I find him?

749
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:31,329
I don't know, I don't know.

750
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:34,832
I don't know. I don't
know. I don't know.

751
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:37,286
Please! I don't know!

752
01:06:37,452 --> 01:06:41,457
I don't know! No! Please! Please.

753
01:06:41,623 --> 01:06:43,466
Please.

754
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:45,753
Not that. Please.

755
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:47,296
I believe you.

756
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:52,475
But it's not gonna save you.

757
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:09,279
- I'm home.
- Daddy!

758
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:11,740
- Hello, darlings.
- Hi, Dad.

759
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:15,415
The chicken smells great.

760
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:17,450
Look who dropped by.

761
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:20,837
Bryan, what a pleasant surprise.

762
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:22,084
Jean-Claude.

763
01:07:22,247 --> 01:07:24,716
The children waited up for you.

764
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:28,219
If you tuck them in, maybe we can
eat before everything gets cold.

765
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:29,925
Bryan, will you do the honors?

766
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:32,006
<i>- Sure.
- I'll be just a minute.</i>

767
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:33,675
Children, bedtime.

768
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:34,888
Yes, it is.

769
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:37,099
It's late. Get to bed now.

770
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:44,193
Sleep well.

771
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:04,710
I was just telling Bryan
how nice it's been...

772
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:07,045
...since you left the
old job for the new one.

773
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:10,052
Home every night for dinner,
get to see the kids more.

774
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:13,306
Yeah, must be nice coming home
every night, seeing your kids.

775
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:15,600
Bryan has been thinking
about relocating.

776
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:17,477
Really? Yes.

777
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:19,433
To Paris, he's been visiting houses.

778
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:22,270
- White or dark meat?
- Dark, please.

779
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:23,775
Find anything interesting?

780
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:27,733
As a matter of fact, I did, in the
10th arrondissement on Rue Paradis.

781
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:31,149
People there know someone
that works in your office.

782
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:33,359
A Mr. Macon. Do you know him?

783
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:35,779
Oh, Henry. I call him Mr. Nervous.

784
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:39,666
Always seems like he's about
to have a problem. Carrots?

785
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:41,667
I got to the bottom of it, Jean-Claude.

786
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:43,165
I know everything.

787
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:46,168
I hope you're not involved in this shit.

788
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:50,377
- What shit?
- This is not the time or place, Bryan.

789
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:52,637
Are you involved? Involved in what?

790
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:54,756
What are you two talking about?

791
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:58,552
- Are you?
- My salary is X, my expenses are Y.

792
01:08:58,718 --> 01:09:00,766
As long as my family is provided for...

793
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:03,556
...I do not care where
the difference comes from.

794
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:05,600
That is my entire involvement.

795
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:07,769
- What about my family?
- I told you...

796
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:10,404
...I would help as long
as it didn't cause trouble.

797
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:11,906
Who is Patrice Saint-Clair?

798
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:15,569
I don't know, I don't care. I
am driving you to the airport.

799
01:09:15,777 --> 01:09:17,029
Jean-Claude.

800
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:18,321
Shut up, Isabelle. Shut up!

801
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:20,161
Let's get going. Dinner is over.

802
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:22,121
- I'm not finished yet.
- Yes, you are.

803
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:25,246
- No!
- No, I'm not.

804
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:33,211
That's what happens when you sit
behind a desk. You forget things.

805
01:09:33,378 --> 01:09:35,847
Like the weight in the
hand of a gun that's loaded.

806
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:38,971
Isabelle!

807
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:40,305
You asshole!

808
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:41,682
It's a flesh wound.

809
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:45,565
But if you don't get me what I
need, the last thing you'll see...

810
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:47,725
...is the bullet I put between her eyes.

811
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:50,941
Now, Patrice Saint-Clair.

812
01:10:02,407 --> 01:10:04,375
You could've made this less painful...

813
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:08,664
...if you had been more concerned about
my daughter and less about your desk.

814
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:11,174
Please apologize to your wife for me.

815
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:19,318
- Can I help you? - Yes, I'm
here to see Mr. Saint-Clair.

816
01:11:19,484 --> 01:11:21,031
Your name, please.

817
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:26,954
I'm sorry, your name is not on the list.

818
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,709
Oh, please check again.

819
01:11:31,746 --> 01:11:33,464
Inside.

820
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:22,339
May I help you, sir?

821
01:12:27,969 --> 01:12:30,472
- Your champagne.
- Yeah, I will take it.

822
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:43,527
<i>I have 50,000. Fifty thousand.</i>

823
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:47,367
<i>Fifty thousand.</i>

824
01:12:48,906 --> 01:12:52,160
<i>One hundred, 100,000.</i>

825
01:12:53,995 --> 01:12:57,169
<i>One hundred, 150.</i>

826
01:12:58,291 --> 01:12:59,463
<i>I have 150.</i>

827
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:02,257
Your champagne, sir.

828
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:05,723
<i>Two, I have two, 250.</i>

829
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:06,929
May I serve?

830
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:08,468
- Please.
- I have 250.

831
01:13:10,303 --> 01:13:12,021
<i>Two-fifty.</i>

832
01:13:12,597 --> 01:13:15,646
<i>Sold for 250,000.</i>

833
01:13:33,701 --> 01:13:35,874
<i>The last item.</i>

834
01:13:36,203 --> 01:13:38,706
<i>As usual, we save the best for last.</i>

835
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,213
<i>Speaks English, some French.</i>

836
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,843
<i>Certified pure.</i>

837
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:53,809
- Sorry.
- Get out.

838
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:58,142
<i>The bidding will begin at 100,000.</i>

839
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:03,732
<i>One hundred.</i>

840
01:14:13,658 --> 01:14:15,456
<i>One hundred thousand.</i>

841
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:17,833
- I said...
- I heard what you said.

842
01:14:17,995 --> 01:14:19,338
Buy her.

843
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:20,630
<i>I have 100.</i>

844
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:25,128
<i>- Buy her.
- One-fifty.</i>

845
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:26,883
<i>Two hundred.</i>

846
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:30,262
<i>Two-fifty, three, 350.</i>

847
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:33,720
<i>Three hundred and fifty thousand.</i>

848
01:14:34,345 --> 01:14:36,564
<i>Four. Four.</i>

849
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:39,525
<i>Four-fifty, 450.</i>

850
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:41,602
<i>Four hundred and fifty thousand.</i>

851
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:43,403
<i>Four-fifty.</i>

852
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:46,531
<i>Five hundred. Five hundred thousand.</i>

853
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:50,696
<i>Five hundred thousand. Sold.</i>

854
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:54,874
<i>That concludes the sales for
tonight. Thank you all for coming.</i>

855
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:58,294
<i>- You can collect your purchases directly.
- Move.</i>

856
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:02,502
- You will never get away with this.
- If you wanna live, you'll make sure I do.

857
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:14,768
Now, Mr...?

858
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:24,445
Well, we know you're not this
man. So, what do we call you?

859
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:29,655
It doesn't matter what we call you...

860
01:15:29,817 --> 01:15:32,286
...what does matter is
what you're doing here.

861
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:35,622
The last girl, I'm her father.

862
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:41,288
- Oh, my.
- Give her to me.

863
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:44,874
I wish I could, honestly.

864
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:46,759
See, I'm a father myself.

865
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:48,965
I have two sons and a daughter...

866
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:52,132
...but let me tell you
something, Mr. Whoever-You-Are.

867
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:53,641
This is a business.

868
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:55,551
This is a very unique business...

869
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:58,471
<i>...with a very unique clientele.
- I'll pay.</i>

870
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:01,148
In this business, you
have no refunds, returns...

871
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:03,401
...discounts, buybacks.
All sales are final.

872
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:08,440
Besides discretion, it's
about the only rule we have.

873
01:16:10,357 --> 01:16:12,860
Kill him. Quietly. I have guests.

874
01:17:11,085 --> 01:17:13,463
Would you please go see
which part of "quietly"...

875
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:16,303
- ... they did not understand?
- Yes, sir.

876
01:17:35,568 --> 01:17:39,289
Okay, we can resolve
this. I know how you feel.

877
01:17:39,446 --> 01:17:42,120
We should talk, okay?
We can work this out.

878
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:46,128
You have no idea...

879
01:17:47,246 --> 01:17:48,463
- Where is she?
- Please.

880
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:49,916
Understand. Please try...

881
01:17:54,628 --> 01:17:57,723
There's a boat by the quay.

882
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:00,426
Please understand.

883
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:04,939
It was all business, it wasn't personal.

884
01:18:05,139 --> 01:18:06,891
It was all personal to me.

885
01:20:53,057 --> 01:20:54,855
They are being prepared, sir.

886
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:58,498
You! Take the girls to the Sheik.

887
01:21:59,248 --> 01:22:00,374
You! Come with me.

888
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:02,630
We have an intruder.

889
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:04,052
<i>Search the boat.</i>

890
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:07,347
<i>Kill him if necessary.</i>

891
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:14,410
It's safer in your room, Excellence.

892
01:23:14,865 --> 01:23:16,663
What's going on? Who is it?

893
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:18,919
The girl's father. He wants her back.

894
01:23:19,203 --> 01:23:20,876
I'll get rid of the dog.

895
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:05,024
We can ne...

896
01:25:16,987 --> 01:25:20,708
- Daddy.
- Kim.

897
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:23,623
You came for me.

898
01:25:28,165 --> 01:25:29,633
You came for me.

899
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:34,471
I told you I would.

900
01:26:02,366 --> 01:26:04,744
<i>May I have your attention.</i>

901
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:06,583
<i>If you're waiting for oversized bags...</i>

902
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,957
Mom.

903
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:13,676
Oh, my God.

904
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:16,339
Oh, sweetie.

905
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:19,349
Oh, here, let me get that for you.

906
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:21,431
Bryan, if there's anything you need...

907
01:26:22,803 --> 01:26:24,976
I've got everything I need.

908
01:26:25,138 --> 01:26:27,766
I love you so much.

909
01:26:29,893 --> 01:26:31,987
Stuart.

910
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:34,898
Thank you.

911
01:26:42,155 --> 01:26:45,125
<i>Attention, travelers.
You are not required to...</i>

912
01:26:45,283 --> 01:26:47,206
Shall we go?

913
01:26:52,249 --> 01:26:54,718
Sure you don't wanna ride with us?

914
01:26:55,335 --> 01:26:57,713
I'll be fine. I'll take a cab. Thanks.

915
01:26:57,879 --> 01:26:59,973
All right.

916
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:10,479
- I love you, Dad.
- Love you too.

917
01:27:33,623 --> 01:27:36,593
- Where are we?
- I told you. It's a surprise.

918
01:27:38,545 --> 01:27:40,513
Hi. Hi.

919
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:46,929
When someone says "hi," it's
usually polite to say "hi" back.

920
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:48,771
Hi.

921
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:50,398
I heard you wanna be a singer.

922
01:27:50,557 --> 01:27:52,355
- I do.
- She does.

923
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:57,280
Well, come on in.
Let's see what you got.
