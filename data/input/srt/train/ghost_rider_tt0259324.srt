1
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:58,287
<i>It's said that the West</i>
<i>was built on legends.</i>

2
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:02,257
<i>Tall tales that help us</i>
<i>make sense of things too great...</i>

3
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:05,295
<i>...or too terrifying to believe.</i>

4
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,894
<i>This is the legend of the Ghost Rider.</i>

5
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:23,872
<i>Story goes</i>
<i>that every generation has one.</i>

6
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:28,350
<i>Some damned soul,</i>
<i>cursed to ride the earth...</i>

7
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:31,854
<i>...collecting on the devil's deals.</i>

8
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:39,992
<i>Many years ago, a Ghost Rider was</i>
<i>sent to the village of San Venganza...</i>

9
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:45,828
<i>...to fetch a contract</i>
<i>worth 1000 evil souls.</i>

10
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,708
<i>But that contract was so powerful...</i>

11
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:57,977
<i>...he knew he could never let</i>
<i>the devil get his hands on it.</i>

12
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:03,183
<i>So he did what no Rider</i>
<i>has ever done before:</i>

13
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,862
<i>He outran the devil himself.</i>

14
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:19,327
<i>The thing about legends is...</i>

15
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,836
<i>...sometimes they're true.</i>

16
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,587
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

17
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:17,425
<i>...the amazing, blazing...</i>

18
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,997
<i>...stunt cycle spectacular!</i>

19
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:47,149
<i>How about a big round of applause</i>
<i>for Barton and Johnny Blaze?</i>

20
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:55,557
<i>Let's hear it for them, folks!</i>

21
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,907
<i>You're a hotshot, ain't you, boy?</i>

22
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,478
Young, think you know everything
there is to know.

23
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:16,883
Think you're gonna live forever.
Is that about right?

24
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,582
- Come on, Dad. It was a patch of dirt.
- That's not the point.

25
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,223
Point is, we've been doing
this act less than a week.

26
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,762
You're already screwing around.

27
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:29,867
- I was just doing it for the crowd.
- We both know why you done it.

28
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:36,703
You think she's gonna stand by you
when you're in a wheelchair?

29
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,809
Huh, hotshot?

30
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:55,356
Son, everything you do in life, every
choice you make has a consequence.

31
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,054
When you do things
without thinking...

32
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,989
...you ain't making the choice,
the choice is making you.

33
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,999
- You understand that?
- Yeah, sure.

34
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,297
What?

35
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,702
I said, "Yes, sir."

36
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:47,012
Hey, Dad, you think maybe I could take
Grace for a ride sometime?

37
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:48,874
Think you're man enough
for Grace?

38
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,811
Hell, yeah.

39
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,818
Well, I don't.

40
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,755
Hey, Johnny.

41
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,688
Hey, Roxie.

42
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,359
Go on.

43
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,559
Hey.

44
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,924
What's wrong, Roxie?

45
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,262
I'm leaving.

46
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,204
What?

47
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,600
My dad's sending me
to live with my mom.

48
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,279
- When?
- Soon.

49
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,211
What about us?

50
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,978
He says
you're not good enough for me.

51
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,018
That you're just a phase.

52
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,322
So what are we gonna do, Johnny?

53
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,996
We'll leave. We'll jump on the bike
and just keep going.

54
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,961
But what about your dad?
What about the show?

55
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:21,140
He doesn't need me.
He doesn't need anybody.

56
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,736
Tomorrow, noon. We'll meet here.

57
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,790
What time is it?

58
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,361
It's late.

59
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,746
Where you going?

60
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,417
Nowhere, Dad.

61
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,586
I'm going nowhere.

62
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,724
Far out.

63
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,834
- Johnny Blaze.
- Yeah.

64
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,567
Caught your show today.

65
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,972
Just wanted to tell you how much
I enjoyed watching you ride.

66
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,304
Oh, thanks.

67
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,373
Perhaps you'd ride for me one day.

68
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,406
You run a show?

69
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:21,319
Greatest show on earth.

70
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,421
Thanks, but no thanks.

71
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,163
What's wrong, Johnny?

72
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:38,733
Worried about your father?

73
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,807
What do you know about that?

74
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,773
Even a blind man
could see he's sick.

75
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:50,745
Thing about cancer
is the time it takes...

76
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:53,508
...the toll on the loved ones.

77
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,316
Lives that are altered.

78
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:01,051
Plans that have to be changed.

79
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,223
Johnny...

80
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,526
...what if I could help your dad?

81
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,730
Yeah? How?

82
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,428
How is not important.

83
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:17,740
What if I could make him better?

84
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,411
Give him back his health?

85
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:24,943
Would you be willing
to make a deal?

86
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:29,948
Name your price.

87
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,556
I'll take...

88
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,259
...your soul.

89
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:48,440
Okay.

90
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:53,908
By sunrise tomorrow, your father
will be healthy as a horse.

91
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:58,850
And you will have your whole life
ahead of you.

92
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,719
It's your choice, Johnny.

93
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,915
All you have to do is sign.

94
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,381
Oh, that'll do just fine.

95
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,162
Damn.

96
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,567
Morning, sleeping beauty.

97
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:51,369
Dad?

98
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,098
- You look--
- Great, right?

99
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:58,571
Least that's what the doc said when
he looked at my x-rays this morning.

100
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,043
- What are you talking about?
- I've been sick, son.

101
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,648
When I finally get up
the nerve to tell you about it...

102
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,374
...I'm not anymore.

103
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:10,488
I can't explain it.
But I feel healthy as a horse.

104
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,782
Now, come on, hotshot.
I got a show to do.

105
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:27,432
Biggest crowd of the week. Hey,
you know what I was thinking about?

106
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,905
A new stunt.
Put us over the top!

107
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,943
Be a jump: me on one side,
you on the other.

108
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:39,607
Instead of the cars or the ring of fire,
a helicopter.

109
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,612
Yeah. That'd be pretty cool,
don't you think?

110
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,954
Hey, you got two minutes to get
in your suit, son, or you're...

111
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,996
Roxanne's dad
is sending her away.

112
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,633
If we don't leave now,
it will be too late.

113
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:01,603
Well, that's great, boy. That's great.
Two kids on the run with nothing.

114
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:05,009
If your goal is to end up together,
that'll make sure it doesn't happen!

115
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,805
I'd rather take my chances
with her than to waste my whole life...

116
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,913
...jumping bikes
at some stupid carnival.

117
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,979
Dad, I want something better
than that.

118
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:23,256
Her old man will have the cops on you
before you get to county line.

119
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,687
I guess I'd better get going then.

120
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,706
Hey, hotshot.

121
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:48,149
You take Grace.

122
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:57,358
At least you'll have
a good head start.

123
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:12,076
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Barton Blaze!</i>

124
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:45,534
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>head for the exits.</i>

125
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,234
<i>Please stay calm.</i>

126
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:51,809
Dad? Dad, it's all right, I'm here.
I'm here, it's gonna be okay.

127
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:52,984
Dad?

128
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:59,050
Dad? Dad?

129
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:58,014
You're no good to me dead.

130
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:14,627
You. You killed him.

131
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,393
I cured his cancer.

132
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,297
That was the deal.

133
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,637
But I couldn't let him
come between us.

134
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,606
You son of a bitch.

135
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:31,643
One day, when I need you...

136
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,452
...I will come.

137
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,916
Until then, I'll be...

138
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,149
I'll be watching.

139
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:45,062
Forget about friends.

140
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,597
Forget about family.

141
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,761
Forget about love.

142
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,674
You're mine, Johnny Blaze.

143
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,987
<i>You can't live in fear.</i>

144
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,889
<i>You can't live in fear.</i>

145
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:03,435
<i>Johnny, Johnny!</i>
<i>Johnny, Johnny!</i>

146
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,610
<i>Johnny, Johnny!</i>

147
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:29,157
Johnny Blaze!

148
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,263
Yeah, Johnny! Yeah!

149
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,214
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

150
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:29,519
<i>...please stay off the field</i>
<i>to allow paramedics through.</i>

151
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:32,188
Oh, God. Oh, God. JB!

152
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:41,904
JB, talk to me, man!

153
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,846
Heck, is the bike okay?

154
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:54,845
Yeah. Yeah.

155
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:58,284
Bike's fine. Oh, God.

156
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,058
Thank you.

157
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,653
Let's go home.

158
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,192
<i>Let's hear it for him, folks.</i>

159
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,961
<i>The amazing Johnny Blaze!</i>

160
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:17,164
Johnny, you gave us all a big scare.
What happened out there tonight?

161
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:20,539
Hey, JB don't do interviews,
all right? I'm sorry. Excuse me.

162
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:40,592
Yeah, come on, come on.

163
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:43,992
Get the front end down. Damn it.

164
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,362
<i>Blaze is down.</i>

165
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,368
- Have you tried not crashing?
- Have you?

166
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:53,469
Why don't you have a beer
and relax like everybody else, huh?

167
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,772
You know alcohol
gives me nightmares.

168
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,410
To each his own.

169
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:09,621
Oh, wait, could you go back?

170
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:13,320
There's a howler monkey special
on Discovery Channel tonight.

171
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:16,023
- Guys, hey.
- <i>We've seen big moves and crashes.</i>

172
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,969
<i>But ask these riders</i>
<i>who it is they look up to...</i>

173
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,800
<i>...and the answer's a man who's not</i>
<i>even competing here, Johnny Blaze.</i>

174
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:25,439
Yeah, that's because he's right here!

175
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,271
<i>--greatest stunt rider of all time...</i>

176
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:30,744
<i>...but what we don't know is how</i>
<i>much longer can Blaze cheat death.</i>

177
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,747
- <i>Critics call it pay-per-view suicide--</i>
- Put the monkey show on.

178
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:36,045
Mack, the monkey show?

179
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:37,983
<i>--with no regard for his own life.</i>

180
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,523
<i>They call him Mr. Invincible,</i>
<i>and he'll have to be at his next jump...</i>

181
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,695
<i>...when Johnny Blaze</i>
<i>will attempt to clear...</i>

182
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:46,887
<i>...the length of a football field</i>
<i>from field goal to field goal.</i>

183
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,238
What?

184
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:02,612
"What." You should be taking
a dirt nap after that ragdoll today.

185
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:04,508
I got lucky.

186
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:08,709
No, I got a hunting dog named Lucky.
He's got one eye and no nuts.

187
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:13,286
Luck don't cover it, JB. Man, you got
an angel looking after you.

188
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,023
- Yeah, maybe.
- Mack, you in?

189
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,690
Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.

190
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,731
Scoot over, ladies.
What's the ante?

191
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,162
Five card draw.

192
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:26,633
Maybe it's something else.

193
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:14,211
There you go.

194
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,851
Took you long enough.

195
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,872
I think you might be lost, boy.

196
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,810
You deaf or something?

197
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:48,512
Angels only in there.

198
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,314
Angels. Really?

199
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,524
Yeah, really.
You got a problem with that?

200
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:58,893
As a matter of fact...

201
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:17,406
...I do.

202
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,256
Yep.
Love your neighborhood, Johnny.

203
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,820
Real friendly around here.

204
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:42,399
Oh, I see you still haven't gotten
a lock for your lift. That's great, great.

205
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:46,441
You've got a lot of expensive bikes
in here, I told you. How many times?

206
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,541
Well, JB, I said it before,
I'll say it again:

207
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:52,683
This place could use a woman's touch.

208
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:56,413
- So could you.
- Heard that.

209
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:02,593
All right, four out of five. Wreck
one more and you get the whole set.

210
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:09,297
Well, I'm glad to see
you found use for your books.

211
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:10,930
You want some jellies?

212
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:14,037
No. I don't want
none of your stupid candy.

213
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:21,276
I wanna talk to you about
something kind of serious.

214
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:22,639
I'm trying to relax, Mack.

215
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:26,044
Yeah, I understand. All right?
It's just gonna take a second.

216
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:35,092
It's about you jumping on the
anniversary of your dad's accident.

217
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,156
Can I just turn this music off
for a minute?

218
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:44,134
<i>I want you to kick higher for me.</i>
<i>Can you get higher?</i>

219
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:46,133
This jump, man, we--

220
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:47,771
<i>Come on! Hit it!</i>

221
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:52,004
Mack, you touch the Carpenters
or that chimp video again...

222
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:56,271
- ...and we got a scrap on our hands.
- This jump is nuts. All right, man?

223
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:59,416
I mean, field goal to field goal,
and now you're adding cars?

224
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:02,582
I mean, what are you
trying to prove?

225
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:04,917
That it's me.

226
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,652
That it's you?

227
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,490
Riding the bike.

228
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:11,790
Of course it's you, man.
Who the hell else is it gonna be?

229
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:13,862
You know what,
you're freaking me out.

230
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:16,158
You're freaking me out
because you're reading...

231
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:19,235
...this comparative exponential
religiosity crap.

232
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:21,334
It's getting in your brain.

233
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,176
I mean, what's going on, man?

234
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,802
Do you believe
people get second chances?

235
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,508
I-- I don't know.

236
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:34,674
If somebody makes a mistake,
a big mistake...

237
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:37,320
...do you think that person
should have to pay for it...

238
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:39,649
...every day
for the rest of their lives?

239
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,625
Are you talking about
your daddy's accident?

240
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,622
Well...

241
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:49,490
I'm just looking for a sign.

242
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:51,866
What kind of sign?

243
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:56,670
That I can take a negative
and turn it into a positive.

244
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,866
That I can have a second chance too.

245
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:05,673
JB, what happened way back when
to your daddy was not your fault.

246
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:08,213
You know that, right?

247
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:16,656
Look, at least promise me
you'll think about taking the cars out.

248
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:18,986
I'll think about it.

249
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:13,139
I knew you were here.
I could smell your fear.

250
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,359
Hello, Gressil.

251
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,433
Why are you here?

252
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:42,012
Wallow.

253
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:48,812
And what do you want from us?

254
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,454
I've come for the contract
of San Venganza.

255
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:55,548
Legend has it that the contract
was stolen and hidden...

256
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,660
...in a graveyard not far from here.

257
00:29:57,862 --> 00:29:59,693
And now you're gonna help me find it.

258
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,100
Abigor.

259
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:08,734
And when we find it, then what?

260
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,567
Then we'll take this world...

261
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:13,433
...one city...

262
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:16,343
...at a time.

263
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:17,776
Blackheart!

264
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:41,638
- What the hell are you doing here?
- It's my time now, old man.

265
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:46,376
Your time will come.
But not now.

266
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,546
We both know
you can't harm me here.

267
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:53,843
I'm not like you. I've never fallen.
I never will.

268
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:59,752
I may not have power over you
in this world, but my rider does.

269
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,524
The Ghost Rider?

270
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:07,427
Your favorite creation?

271
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:11,993
The power of hellfire
wasted on a pathetic human?

272
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,135
If you had trusted me...

273
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,966
...if you had given me
what was rightfully mine--

274
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:21,544
It's all mine.
Until the end of days.

275
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:25,540
Go ahead.

276
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,249
Send the rider.

277
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,412
I'll bury him.

278
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:32,880
And then I'll bury you.

279
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:34,887
Father.

280
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:53,343
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to</i>
<i>the Johnny Blaze Leap of Death!</i>

281
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:58,849
Yeah!

282
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:05,890
Johnny B!

283
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:15,898
Hey, JB.

284
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,531
You're stepping on Karen.

285
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,935
What was it
you were gonna say, Mack?

286
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,546
I just ran a second check
on the ramps. They look good.

287
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,384
Crowd's kind of out of control.

288
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:37,486
Johnny, you know
you don't have to do this, don't you?

289
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:42,887
Does this suit fit all right?
Feels a little loose.

290
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:45,526
Suit's fine.

291
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,063
Would you bring me my hat, Mack?
Thank you.

292
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,941
You can't live in fear.

293
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,575
All right, we're up here on the right.

294
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,645
Mr. Blaze. Amy Page, event publicity.

295
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:07,409
- Have time for a quick interview?
- I don't know how long...

296
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:10,485
...you been doing your job,
but Johnny Blaze don't do interviews.

297
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:12,519
Not even for an old friend?

298
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,262
<i>Hey, Johnny.</i>

299
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,902
Hi.

300
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,170
I'll do it.

301
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,410
Makeup.

302
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:40,780
He's good.

303
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,482
Oh, you're looking at the suit.

304
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,820
I know it's silly, but the fans
like it, so I keep on wearing it.

305
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:54,161
- What about the cane?
- I need support.

306
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:56,797
No. It's part of the costume.

307
00:33:57,635 --> 00:34:02,971
Okay, and ready
in five, four, three, two...

308
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:04,607
How's your dad?

309
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:09,110
Johnny Blaze, thank you for talking
to us before your big jump.

310
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:12,305
No one has ever attempted
such a distance before:

311
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:15,384
Three hundred feet
from field goal to field goal.

312
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:17,816
What's going through your mind
right now?

313
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:21,355
You look really good.
I've seen you on TV.

314
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:25,120
You know, I watch a lot of TV
and you do a really good job.

315
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:30,958
Johnny, what drives somebody
to risk their life for entertainment?

316
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:32,534
I heard you got married.

317
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:36,903
Oh, no. No, it didn't happen.

318
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:38,933
No?

319
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:44,680
Most of the time the press focuses on
the crashes, the broken bones...

320
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:46,179
...the costs of what you do.

321
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,251
Are there any other costs?

322
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:50,114
<i>--commemorating this</i>
<i>epic milestone...</i>

323
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:52,812
<i>...in the life of</i>
<i>the world's greatest stuntman.</i>

324
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:56,726
<i>And remember, 40 percent</i>
<i>of all proceeds tonight...</i>

325
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,793
- Yeah.
- <i>...go to the Barton Blaze Foundation...</i>

326
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:02,124
<i>...dedicated to helping those in need</i>
<i>here in our home state...</i>

327
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:03,698
Okay, well...

328
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:06,927
Thank you for this revealing peek
into the life of Johnny Blaze.

329
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,165
I'm Roxanne Simpson, on scene.

330
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:11,733
And we're out.

331
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:16,313
- You're gonna stay for the jump, right?
- You know, we gotta get back.

332
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:18,812
Plus, I never liked watching you jump.

333
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:26,754
- Please.
- Let's go, guys.

334
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,357
Roxanne?

335
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:39,431
- Come on, just one signature.
- You need to get back to your seat.

336
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,039
- You don't have to push.
- All right.

337
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:46,699
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say
you two had some kind of history.

338
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:48,636
That was it, Mack.

339
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:50,510
The sign.

340
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:52,008
The sign?

341
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:56,979
- Sure you don't wanna stick around?
- No.

342
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:58,849
It hasn't started yet.

343
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,848
I'll buy you a doughnut.

344
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:03,517
Come on, Roxie, it's Johnny Blaze.

345
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:05,320
Let's go.

346
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:07,889
Thank God you listened to me,
took the cars out.

347
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,192
It would've been suicide otherwise.

348
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:12,665
This way if you come up short, see...

349
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:16,567
...you'll come down
on some nice, soft, green...

350
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,202
...grass.

351
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:24,211
<i>Johnny Blaze will not be jumping</i>
<i>50 cars today as scheduled...</i>

352
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:28,943
<i>...but instead will be leaping</i>
<i>six UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters.</i>

353
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:33,249
<i>Never before has any man attempted</i>
<i>such a death-defying stunt.</i>

354
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:35,955
I took the cars out.

355
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,597
Why? Why, JB?
Why wouldn't you tell me?

356
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:46,565
- Because you would have thrown a fit.
- Call me old-fashioned...

357
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:49,706
...I'm funny that way. Human sacrifice
makes me uncomfortable.

358
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,339
Why, JB? Why helicopters, man?

359
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:57,313
<i>You know what I've been</i>
<i>thinking about? A new stunt.</i>

360
00:36:57,515 --> 00:37:00,416
But instead of the cars
or the ring of fire...

361
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:02,819
...a helicopter.

362
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:07,281
My dad thought it'd be cool.

363
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:12,724
- He was right.
- Yeah.

364
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:15,427
Okay. Okay. This is the deal, man.

365
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:18,363
Halfway down the ramp I want you
to hit the NOS, okay?

366
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,831
Do not hit the NOS too early.

367
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:22,528
If you hit it too early, you are screwed.
You got that?

368
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:25,402
Hey, JB, where's your head at, man?

369
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:29,908
She's probably on the interstate
by now, huh?

370
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,784
How much NOS
did you put in the tanks?

371
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,959
Enough to shame the space shuttle.
Chief, go ahead.

372
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:53,594
Oh, God. He ain't gonna make it.

373
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,323
He made it!

374
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,819
I told you he'd make it! Yeah, JB!

375
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,931
<i>Let's hear it for him,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

376
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,591
<i>Three hundred feet! A world record,</i>
<i>as only Johnny Blaze can do!</i>

377
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:39,412
Yeah! Yeah!

378
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,249
Where's he going?

379
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:50,325
I'll say one thing about the guy,
he's got guts.

380
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:53,463
I mean, the other day I was watching
this, like, sports show--

381
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,599
Stuart, can you please stop talking
about Johnny Blaze already?

382
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,503
Yeah, that might be a little hard.

383
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:07,001
I made it!

384
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:12,311
- Pull over!
- Do you want me to pull over?

385
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,541
- Drive.
- Driving.

386
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,154
Come on, Roxie,
I need to talk to you.

387
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,633
What's your name?

388
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:39,099
- What?
- What's your name?

389
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,902
Oh, Stuart!

390
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,270
- Johnny.
- Hi.

391
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,608
Well, Stuart,
can you help me out here?

392
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,652
Sorry, dude. She's the boss.

393
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,690
Johnny, look out!

394
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:06,603
All right, I guess I see
how it's gonna be. Hang on!

395
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,588
Howdy. Howdy, howdy, howdy.

396
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:29,760
Are you trying to kill yourself?

397
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,293
I wanna talk to you.
I haven't seen you in 56,000 years.

398
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:35,089
This is crazy. You are crazy.

399
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:37,597
I don't have time for this,
I have a story to edit.

400
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:39,167
You could have said no.

401
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:44,133
When they asked you to interview me,
you could have said no.

402
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:48,572
- Move your van out of the way!
- What are you trying to say?

403
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,873
Well, I'm not trying to say anything.
I'm saying that means something.

404
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:56,012
- Sorry!
- Don't mind them, they're fine.

405
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,245
We are on the side of the freeway.

406
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,948
Let's get some dinner.
You still like Italian?

407
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,692
What's this about, Johnny?
You want some closure?

408
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:11,429
Look, you were 17 and you witnessed
a tragedy and you ran.

409
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,603
I understand now
like I understood then...

410
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,669
...and I have no hard feelings, none.

411
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:19,741
That's why they call it the past, because
it's passed. It's done, it's over with.

412
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:28,211
Too much?

413
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:36,759
There's a restaurant in my hotel,
the Plaza. Eight o'clock.

414
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:38,287
Yes!

415
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,060
Don't be late.

416
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:45,258
This is a sign, Roxanne.

417
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,403
There are no accidents.

418
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:49,573
Destiny and all that.

419
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,433
Johnny! Johnny! Johnny!

420
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:54,008
- Can you please sign my sister's book?
- Oh, sure.

421
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:55,200
- 300 feet.
- We love you.

422
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:56,811
Well, thank you.

423
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,141
Three hundred feet.
Pretty neat, pretty neat.

424
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,544
Right on, Johnny.

425
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,217
Thank you.

426
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:32,782
You can't live in fear.

427
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,811
You can't live in fear.

428
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:39,455
You made that jump.
No one else made that jump.

429
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:41,488
You're the best rider.

430
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:47,153
You deserve a second chance.

431
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:49,598
She's a sign.

432
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:10,413
<i>Johnny.</i>

433
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:39,509
Okay.

434
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:13,908
<i>Johnny.</i>

435
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:56,685
You.

436
00:44:57,995 --> 00:44:59,587
Hello, Johnny.

437
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:02,296
Stay away from me.

438
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,493
Little late for that.

439
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:07,603
Nice bike.

440
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,598
Why are you here?

441
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:15,370
Oh, I've always been here, Johnny.

442
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:16,813
All along.

443
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:18,948
Phoenix...

444
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:20,309
...Denver...

445
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:21,711
...Houston.

446
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:25,319
It was you. Keeping me alive.

447
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:27,547
No. No, Johnny.

448
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:29,225
It's all you.

449
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:31,721
You're the best.

450
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:35,094
And I'm your greatest fan.

451
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:39,133
The posters, the video games...

452
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:43,864
...the crowds screaming, chanting:

453
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,268
"Johnny.

454
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:47,740
Johnny.

455
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:50,737
Johnny."

456
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:54,675
It makes me so proud.

457
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:59,820
It's like watching an investment...

458
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:03,083
...that keeps growing and growing...

459
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:07,320
...until the day you cash it in.

460
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:10,933
That day is today, Johnny.

461
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:14,796
Find the one known as Blackheart...

462
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:17,197
...and destroy him.

463
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:19,136
Find him yourself.

464
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,706
Doesn't work like that.

465
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:25,242
You're under contract, remember?

466
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:28,775
If you succeed...

467
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,412
...I'll return your soul.

468
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:35,120
Yeah, I'm not doing it.

469
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:37,653
You don't have any choice.

470
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:52,068
Hey.

471
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,464
You can't come in here.
This is private...

472
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:00,200
...property.

473
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,378
There was a cemetery here.

474
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:04,940
Yeah, a long time ago.

475
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:08,014
What happened to the graves?

476
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:11,486
They moved them.

477
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:13,223
Where?

478
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:18,994
- I don't know.
- Who would?

479
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:23,932
Saint Michael's church.

480
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:26,599
They're in charge of the whole thing.

481
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:29,498
Look, you really shouldn't be here.

482
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,043
That's what they keep telling me.

483
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:55,692
God!

484
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,157
Looking for someone?

485
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:04,694
Back to hell.

486
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:09,135
We're not gonna have a meaningful
conversation now, are we?

487
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,531
You're going down.

488
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:14,304
I don't think so.

489
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:03,917
He ain't so tough.

490
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,560
Hey. Dirtbag.

491
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:28,377
Have mercy.

492
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:31,748
Sorry. All out of mercy.

493
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:48,666
Help me!

494
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:52,667
Wait.

495
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:54,803
You think I'm pretty, right?

496
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:01,739
Oh, God.

497
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:07,941
Give me the damn bag!

498
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,579
Help!

499
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:12,949
Help!

500
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:25,894
Thanks.

501
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:31,403
You.

502
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,901
Guilty.

503
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:40,742
Look into my eyes.

504
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:51,482
Your soul is stained
by the blood of the innocent.

505
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,361
Feel their pain.

506
00:53:55,565 --> 00:54:00,161
No!

507
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:07,634
Give me your wallet!

508
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:13,212
Let me go!

509
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:51,943
Morning, bonehead.

510
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:05,820
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

511
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:08,957
I feel like my skull's on fire,
but I'm good. Thanks for the water.

512
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:10,148
Did you see my bike?

513
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:13,526
Did I say something funny?

514
00:57:13,897 --> 00:57:15,023
Ironic.

515
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:17,992
We're big on irony around here.

516
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,900
- It's out by the shed.
- Thanks.

517
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,572
It does.

518
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:25,775
What?

519
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:29,536
You're wondering if your bike
looks normal? It does.

520
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,972
And to answer your other questions:

521
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:34,013
Last night did happen...

522
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:35,912
...it wasn't a dream...

523
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,546
...and it will happen again.

524
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:40,753
Who are you?

525
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:45,156
Question is, who are you?

526
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:49,894
You are the Rider.
The Ghost Rider.

527
00:57:51,267 --> 00:57:54,134
Get used to it, kid.
It'll be a lot easier.

528
00:57:54,337 --> 00:57:57,306
If you don't, I got a nice cozy spot
picked out for you.

529
00:58:11,024 --> 00:58:14,585
They've seen you now.
They'll be waiting for you.

530
00:58:15,362 --> 00:58:18,422
You'll need my help,
you expect to last the night.

531
00:58:18,732 --> 00:58:22,065
Last time I let a stranger help me
it didn't pan out so good.

532
00:58:22,402 --> 00:58:25,030
This ain't something
you can run from, kid.

533
00:58:25,472 --> 00:58:27,872
This day has been coming
since you made that deal.

534
00:58:37,651 --> 00:58:39,516
Congratulations.

535
00:58:39,719 --> 00:58:42,688
Your chances
just went from none to slim.

536
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:46,684
Sources close to the investigation
say that there may be a link...

537
00:58:46,893 --> 00:58:48,918
...between what happened
here in downtown...

538
00:58:49,129 --> 00:58:51,393
...and the Broken Spoke massacre
in the desert.

539
00:58:51,598 --> 00:58:53,463
I'm Roxanne Simpson on scene.

540
00:58:54,301 --> 00:58:55,598
And we're out.

541
00:58:57,537 --> 00:58:58,731
- Captain Dolan.
- No comment.

542
00:58:58,939 --> 00:59:01,635
Is it true they found a connection
between the massacre...

543
00:59:01,842 --> 00:59:04,470
...and last night's victim
here at the city train yards?

544
00:59:08,815 --> 00:59:10,112
No comment.

545
00:59:12,586 --> 00:59:13,712
Off the record, captain.

546
00:59:17,424 --> 00:59:19,085
Off the record?

547
00:59:19,392 --> 00:59:20,359
Piss off.

548
00:59:25,832 --> 00:59:28,266
The Rider is the devil's bounty hunter.

549
00:59:30,136 --> 00:59:33,537
Sent to hunt down anyone
that escapes from hell.

550
00:59:34,374 --> 00:59:36,569
Sterilize that for me.

551
00:59:37,043 --> 00:59:38,601
Sterilize.

552
00:59:44,217 --> 00:59:45,980
In the boiling water.

553
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,187
Right. Okay.

554
00:59:49,556 --> 00:59:51,524
Little confused.

555
00:59:52,359 --> 00:59:54,691
During the day you'll be normal.

556
00:59:55,395 --> 00:59:56,828
But at night...

557
00:59:58,331 --> 01:00:00,196
...in the presence of evil...

558
01:00:01,034 --> 01:00:02,797
...the Rider takes over.

559
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:05,697
I remember now.

560
01:00:06,306 --> 01:00:07,500
Last night.

561
01:00:11,011 --> 01:00:14,469
There was some punk...

562
01:00:14,681 --> 01:00:18,048
...and I could see all the wrong
he'd ever done...

563
01:00:18,585 --> 01:00:20,883
...and I turned it all against him.

564
01:00:21,555 --> 01:00:23,386
The Penance Stare.

565
01:00:24,925 --> 01:00:27,359
It sears the souls of the wicked.

566
01:00:28,595 --> 01:00:31,393
It's the Ghost Rider's greatest weapon.

567
01:00:31,598 --> 01:00:33,532
All the Riders have it.

568
01:00:35,435 --> 01:00:40,566
Have there been others
with my "Ghost Rider" problem?

569
01:00:40,941 --> 01:00:42,408
Been a few.

570
01:00:42,609 --> 01:00:45,237
Last one was 150 years ago...

571
01:00:46,279 --> 01:00:49,146
...in a little town
called San Venganza.

572
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:51,815
Nice town.

573
01:00:52,886 --> 01:00:54,410
Nice people.

574
01:00:54,621 --> 01:00:57,715
Till a stranger came along
making promises...

575
01:00:58,458 --> 01:01:00,255
...one deal at a time.

576
01:01:01,094 --> 01:01:04,928
Consumed by greed,
they turned on one another...

577
01:01:05,332 --> 01:01:09,894
...until the village of San Venganza
drowned in its own blood...

578
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:14,864
...their souls trapped forever
in that godforsaken place.

579
01:01:15,508 --> 01:01:17,476
What's this have to do
with Blackheart?

580
01:01:19,846 --> 01:01:21,177
Blackheart?

581
01:01:23,383 --> 01:01:25,351
He sent you after Blackheart?

582
01:01:26,152 --> 01:01:27,449
And others.

583
01:01:27,887 --> 01:01:29,184
The Hidden.

584
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:36,092
Fallen angels cast out of heaven
by Saint Michael himself.

585
01:01:36,796 --> 01:01:41,995
They hide within the elements
waiting for the end of days.

586
01:01:45,305 --> 01:01:47,603
You better hang around here, kid.

587
01:01:49,809 --> 01:01:52,403
They can't come
onto hallowed ground.

588
01:01:54,381 --> 01:01:55,348
Thanks.

589
01:01:56,016 --> 01:01:57,278
And thanks for the info.

590
01:01:57,484 --> 01:02:00,510
I feel much better now that I know
I'm the devil's bounty hunter.

591
01:02:04,324 --> 01:02:07,316
- Where you going?
- Somebody I gotta see.

592
01:02:07,527 --> 01:02:09,324
That's a bad idea.

593
01:02:11,064 --> 01:02:12,895
Wouldn't be my first.

594
01:02:17,037 --> 01:02:18,595
Why'd you do it?

595
01:02:21,574 --> 01:02:23,371
Why'd you make the deal?

596
01:02:24,077 --> 01:02:25,442
I was a kid.

597
01:02:26,212 --> 01:02:28,009
What'd you get in return?

598
01:02:33,253 --> 01:02:34,811
Heartache.

599
01:02:45,732 --> 01:02:48,394
Captain. Captain!

600
01:02:49,436 --> 01:02:51,666
Forensics on the bikers
and the station manager...

601
01:02:51,871 --> 01:02:54,066
...suggest the same cause of death.

602
01:02:55,575 --> 01:02:57,008
Sulfur poison?

603
01:02:57,210 --> 01:03:00,236
- I didn't think sulfur was toxic.
- It is, in massive doses.

604
01:03:00,447 --> 01:03:02,745
And these guys were swimming in it.

605
01:03:02,949 --> 01:03:04,917
Could be the work
of a chemical attack.

606
01:03:05,118 --> 01:03:06,983
Or a religious nut.

607
01:03:07,187 --> 01:03:10,020
Hey. I know you. I've seen--

608
01:03:11,691 --> 01:03:15,593
Okay? There's nothing here
to suggest any kind of religious m.o.

609
01:03:15,795 --> 01:03:17,763
- Sulfur?
- What about it?

610
01:03:17,964 --> 01:03:19,693
Ever read the Old Testament?

611
01:03:22,535 --> 01:03:23,797
Brimstone.

612
01:03:24,504 --> 01:03:26,096
There you go.

613
01:03:32,746 --> 01:03:33,872
Oh, my God.

614
01:03:42,155 --> 01:03:45,283
It's hard to describe the destruction
here this morning.

615
01:03:45,492 --> 01:03:47,722
Can I get you people
to stand back, please?

616
01:03:47,927 --> 01:03:51,419
I don't know. It seems like
something supernatural.

617
01:03:51,631 --> 01:03:53,826
Could you tell us about
the Good Samaritan?

618
01:03:54,033 --> 01:03:56,331
Well, I'll never forget him,
that's for sure.

619
01:03:56,870 --> 01:04:01,307
He was tall, broad shoulders,
and thin, really thin, like bony.

620
01:04:01,508 --> 01:04:05,274
And he had this rad chopper,
it was all flames and stuff.

621
01:04:05,478 --> 01:04:10,677
Oh, and his face was a skull
and it was on fire.

622
01:04:14,354 --> 01:04:15,753
"On fire."

623
01:04:16,222 --> 01:04:17,519
Yeah, like:

624
01:04:20,126 --> 01:04:21,684
Like that much fire.

625
01:04:21,895 --> 01:04:25,160
And I know it sounds weird,
but it looked okay on him.

626
01:04:25,365 --> 01:04:29,324
I mean, it was an edge look
but he totally pulled it off.

627
01:04:31,304 --> 01:04:32,896
Not sure what to add to that.

628
01:04:34,274 --> 01:04:37,004
I'm Roxanne Simpson on scene.

629
01:04:38,645 --> 01:04:39,612
Thanks.

630
01:04:47,487 --> 01:04:49,182
- Roxie--
- Don't.

631
01:04:49,923 --> 01:04:52,414
Now, hold on a second.
Let me apologize.

632
01:04:52,625 --> 01:04:55,594
- Last night was inexcusable.
- No apologies.

633
01:04:55,795 --> 01:04:58,628
See, you did me a favor last night...

634
01:04:58,832 --> 01:05:01,300
...because you made me think
of then and now.

635
01:05:01,501 --> 01:05:03,969
And when you left,
yeah, it hurt like hell.

636
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:06,434
But you know what? I got over it...

637
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,809
...and I went to college,
I got a great job.

638
01:05:10,476 --> 01:05:12,034
But you, Johnny...

639
01:05:12,745 --> 01:05:14,303
...you're just the same.

640
01:05:15,215 --> 01:05:17,877
Oh, better paid, more fans...

641
01:05:18,084 --> 01:05:20,052
...but you're still just a carny.

642
01:05:25,692 --> 01:05:26,716
Yeah.

643
01:05:27,794 --> 01:05:29,091
Oh, man.

644
01:05:29,929 --> 01:05:31,590
My dad was right.

645
01:05:31,798 --> 01:05:33,322
You were just a phase.

646
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,964
That went well.

647
01:05:47,046 --> 01:05:49,344
Hey, captain! I got something.

648
01:06:48,241 --> 01:06:49,902
"End of days.

649
01:06:54,714 --> 01:06:58,480
The host can gain control
of the possessing spirit...

650
01:06:58,685 --> 01:07:03,019
...through concentration on
and manipulation of...

651
01:07:03,222 --> 01:07:06,919
...the fire element
that exists within man."

652
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:20,767
I am speaking to the fire element
within me.

653
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:26,505
Give me control
over the possessing spirit.

654
01:07:48,835 --> 01:07:49,995
- Hi.
- Hi.

655
01:07:50,203 --> 01:07:53,138
Hey, I hope you don't mind.
Your lift was open.

656
01:07:56,676 --> 01:07:58,610
I came to apologize.

657
01:07:59,012 --> 01:08:01,344
I'm leaving town tonight...

658
01:08:02,515 --> 01:08:06,315
...and I didn't want what I said today
to be the last words between us.

659
01:08:06,686 --> 01:08:09,678
- That's okay.
- No, it's not.

660
01:08:10,857 --> 01:08:14,384
It was cruel and totally untrue.

661
01:08:14,594 --> 01:08:16,255
And I feel really terrible about it.

662
01:08:16,462 --> 01:08:18,794
Please, don't. It's okay.

663
01:08:21,634 --> 01:08:22,601
Is something burning?

664
01:08:24,037 --> 01:08:27,996
Oh, that must be coming from outside.
Neighbor's hibachi.

665
01:08:28,207 --> 01:08:29,299
Bill, he just got it.

666
01:08:29,876 --> 01:08:31,207
I still have that one.

667
01:08:32,011 --> 01:08:32,978
You what?

668
01:08:35,615 --> 01:08:37,674
I have that one, too.

669
01:08:46,526 --> 01:08:48,517
I remember that day.

670
01:08:49,962 --> 01:08:51,862
There were a dozen people
waiting in line...

671
01:08:52,065 --> 01:08:54,295
...and you went through
a whole roll of quarters.

672
01:08:55,001 --> 01:08:57,902
Look at my face.
You can tell I was just terrified...

673
01:08:58,104 --> 01:09:00,937
...that my dad was gonna
come in any second.

674
01:09:15,888 --> 01:09:17,355
Okay, I just--

675
01:09:19,525 --> 01:09:22,824
It's just-- I think I should
walk you to your car.

676
01:09:26,199 --> 01:09:28,190
See, it's not great timing.

677
01:09:32,438 --> 01:09:34,497
You almost kill yourself
on the highway...

678
01:09:34,707 --> 01:09:37,005
...so you can ask me out
and then you don't show.

679
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:38,871
Then you keep my picture...

680
01:09:39,078 --> 01:09:42,206
...but when I kiss you, you try to
shove me out the door. What's--?

681
01:09:42,415 --> 01:09:43,814
What's going on?

682
01:09:45,718 --> 01:09:48,209
Don't you care about me at all,
Johnny?

683
01:09:48,421 --> 01:09:52,482
You know you can talk to me.
You can tell me anything.

684
01:09:54,293 --> 01:09:55,590
Please.

685
01:09:58,531 --> 01:10:00,055
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

686
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:05,030
Try me.

687
01:10:05,238 --> 01:10:06,762
You'll think I'm crazy.

688
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:08,573
Maybe I am crazy.

689
01:10:08,774 --> 01:10:09,968
I hope I'm crazy.

690
01:10:10,176 --> 01:10:13,441
In my job, I've seen and heard
just about everything.

691
01:10:13,813 --> 01:10:17,180
So there is nothing you can tell me
that's gonna surprise me.

692
01:10:18,151 --> 01:10:19,277
Off the record?

693
01:10:20,586 --> 01:10:21,746
Yeah.

694
01:10:34,333 --> 01:10:36,301
I sold my soul to the devil.

695
01:10:43,676 --> 01:10:45,769
And now I have to spare you.

696
01:10:47,813 --> 01:10:48,905
Spare me from what?

697
01:10:49,115 --> 01:10:51,379
The devil,
on account of I work for him.

698
01:10:51,584 --> 01:10:53,779
That's why I couldn't make it to dinner.

699
01:10:55,588 --> 01:10:57,988
Because you were
working for the devil?

700
01:10:58,191 --> 01:11:00,216
Well, yeah. I'm his bounty hunter.

701
01:11:00,426 --> 01:11:03,953
But it only happens at night,
like it is right now.

702
01:11:04,163 --> 01:11:05,425
Whenever I'm around evil.

703
01:11:05,631 --> 01:11:10,796
Evil people, evil spirits.
I change into...

704
01:11:12,438 --> 01:11:13,496
What?

705
01:11:14,707 --> 01:11:19,667
Just a great big monster,
but I am learning to--

706
01:11:19,879 --> 01:11:22,074
I'm getting control of it.

707
01:11:22,281 --> 01:11:23,714
I'm trying to.

708
01:11:25,751 --> 01:11:28,151
So tonight, you'll...

709
01:11:30,656 --> 01:11:31,816
I believe so.

710
01:11:32,024 --> 01:11:35,482
Which is why it's probably
a very good idea...

711
01:11:36,562 --> 01:11:39,030
...that you run on home now, Roxie.

712
01:11:43,236 --> 01:11:44,533
You're serious.

713
01:11:49,342 --> 01:11:52,539
So this is your excuse?

714
01:11:52,845 --> 01:11:56,941
For the past? For last night?
For everything?

715
01:12:07,627 --> 01:12:10,391
The way I see it is
I've got a couple of choices:

716
01:12:11,664 --> 01:12:15,794
I could either accept that you really
believe what you're telling me is true...

717
01:12:16,002 --> 01:12:18,470
...and take you to
the nearest psychiatric hospital.

718
01:12:18,671 --> 01:12:19,660
You see, now that--

719
01:12:19,872 --> 01:12:24,070
Or I realize that you'd rather
make up ridiculous stories...

720
01:12:24,277 --> 01:12:26,177
...than be honest with me...

721
01:12:26,979 --> 01:12:29,379
...and I walk out of that door...

722
01:12:29,682 --> 01:12:30,910
...forever.

723
01:12:57,576 --> 01:12:58,702
- Don't move!
- Hands up!

724
01:12:58,911 --> 01:13:02,005
Hands where we can see them!
Right over your head.

725
01:13:02,581 --> 01:13:03,946
Johnny Blaze.

726
01:13:05,318 --> 01:13:06,512
Yeah.

727
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:11,349
Captain Jack Dolan.
This is Officer Edwards.

728
01:13:12,525 --> 01:13:13,753
You're coming with us.

729
01:13:15,828 --> 01:13:17,090
Okay.

730
01:13:22,401 --> 01:13:24,130
<i>Let's try this again.</i>

731
01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:28,262
We have your plate and the tread
from your tires at the crime scene.

732
01:13:28,474 --> 01:13:30,738
We have a witness who will testify...

733
01:13:30,943 --> 01:13:33,411
...that the suspect
used some kind of fire effect.

734
01:13:33,612 --> 01:13:36,638
An effect just like the ones
that you use in your stunt shows!

735
01:13:36,849 --> 01:13:41,047
Yeah. But I told you,
I didn't kill anybody.

736
01:13:49,161 --> 01:13:52,255
- What about him, you remember him?
- No.

737
01:13:52,531 --> 01:13:54,362
This guy was three years
from retirement...

738
01:13:54,567 --> 01:13:55,898
...never harmed a fly.

739
01:13:56,102 --> 01:13:58,468
In fact, neither did
most of the corpses turning up...

740
01:13:58,671 --> 01:14:00,935
...since you came home,
you son of a bitch.

741
01:14:02,108 --> 01:14:04,406
- I didn't kill anybody.
- Bullshit!

742
01:14:04,610 --> 01:14:06,168
Okay, let's take a breather.

743
01:14:09,081 --> 01:14:10,878
- It's warm in here.
- Warm?

744
01:14:11,083 --> 01:14:12,880
Yeah, I'm burning up. Aren't you?

745
01:14:13,085 --> 01:14:14,279
A little.

746
01:14:17,022 --> 01:14:18,387
You want a cigarette?

747
01:14:18,924 --> 01:14:20,016
Okay.

748
01:14:20,826 --> 01:14:22,384
Mind if I do?

749
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:29,093
Okay, that was weird.

750
01:14:32,338 --> 01:14:35,569
Look, Johnny,
I'm not asking for your help.

751
01:14:35,908 --> 01:14:38,809
I'm asking you to help yourself.

752
01:14:39,979 --> 01:14:42,573
I watch a lot of TV
and I know what you're doing.

753
01:14:43,082 --> 01:14:46,745
Good cop, bad cop.
But you're both good cops.

754
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:51,422
And you provide
a very, very important civil service.

755
01:14:51,624 --> 01:14:53,489
In fact, when I finish my stunt career...

756
01:14:53,692 --> 01:14:57,128
...I intend to apply my skills
to being a motorcycle policeman.

757
01:14:57,329 --> 01:15:00,821
So I'd love to help you.
But I didn't kill anybody.

758
01:15:01,534 --> 01:15:03,661
Jesus Christ.

759
01:15:03,869 --> 01:15:06,997
Who you trying to convince, Johnny?
Us or yourself?

760
01:15:07,206 --> 01:15:08,969
We're trying to help you here.

761
01:15:09,175 --> 01:15:12,201
We're trying to keep this thing quiet.

762
01:15:12,411 --> 01:15:15,812
Yeah, because I imagine that
your fans wouldn't be too keen...

763
01:15:16,015 --> 01:15:19,416
...on you being wrapped up
in a homicide investigation.

764
01:15:19,618 --> 01:15:24,146
Not to mention all those
corporate sponsors, event promoters...

765
01:15:27,426 --> 01:15:30,623
You ready to talk now, Johnny?

766
01:15:32,565 --> 01:15:34,590
Or do you want to spend
the night in the tank?

767
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,961
Oh, I don't wanna do that.

768
01:15:37,436 --> 01:15:40,803
No, sir. I sure don't wanna do that.

769
01:15:43,943 --> 01:15:46,002
But I didn't kill anybody.

770
01:15:47,379 --> 01:15:48,471
Damn it!

771
01:15:50,516 --> 01:15:53,485
You gotta let me go.
The real killer's out there.

772
01:15:54,487 --> 01:15:56,978
- Lookie here.
- But you're making a mistake.

773
01:15:57,189 --> 01:15:58,486
What've we got?

774
01:15:59,225 --> 01:16:01,216
Come on, move your ass!

775
01:16:06,432 --> 01:16:07,763
Blaze, riding up to meet us.

776
01:16:07,967 --> 01:16:11,300
Oh, God. Oh, please. Please,
you don't wanna put me in there.

777
01:16:11,504 --> 01:16:13,096
Sorry, the Ritz was booked.

778
01:16:19,044 --> 01:16:21,740
Oh, God.
Please, get me out of here!

779
01:16:24,617 --> 01:16:26,414
You look like that Johnny Blaze.

780
01:16:27,052 --> 01:16:30,852
Yeah, yeah, I hear that a lot.

781
01:16:31,423 --> 01:16:32,856
Nah, that is you.

782
01:16:33,058 --> 01:16:34,958
- That's him!
- Yeah, it is.

783
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:38,357
I saw you jump in the state fair
a few years ago.

784
01:16:38,564 --> 01:16:41,260
I paid 10 bucks to watch you splatter.

785
01:16:43,802 --> 01:16:45,167
But you didn't.

786
01:16:45,371 --> 01:16:47,168
Looks like somebody's tripping out.

787
01:16:47,506 --> 01:16:49,474
You might be a big shot
out there, Blaze...

788
01:16:49,675 --> 01:16:52,405
...but in here you're nothing
but a monkey in a cage!

789
01:16:52,611 --> 01:16:54,602
Now, I don't want any trouble.

790
01:16:54,813 --> 01:16:56,678
I don't want any trouble.

791
01:16:56,882 --> 01:16:59,146
Looks like trouble just found you.

792
01:17:00,786 --> 01:17:02,617
Nice jacket.

793
01:17:03,422 --> 01:17:04,855
Come on, man, leave him alone.

794
01:17:05,057 --> 01:17:06,024
Get lost!

795
01:17:06,225 --> 01:17:08,386
- The jacket's mine.
- Stop it!

796
01:17:43,228 --> 01:17:45,059
Nice jacket.

797
01:17:47,399 --> 01:17:49,128
Very nice.

798
01:18:08,988 --> 01:18:10,080
You.

799
01:18:12,458 --> 01:18:13,618
Innocent.

800
01:18:45,324 --> 01:18:48,953
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

801
01:18:51,764 --> 01:18:53,391
I've sinned a lot.

802
01:19:16,822 --> 01:19:17,914
Hold it!

803
01:19:54,993 --> 01:19:57,086
Where's the contract
of San Venganza?

804
01:19:57,296 --> 01:19:59,230
I don't know
what you are talking about.

805
01:19:59,431 --> 01:20:04,698
Don't lie to me! You've been protecting
it all these years, sworn to secrecy.

806
01:20:04,903 --> 01:20:07,064
Sworn to keep it
from the likes of you!

807
01:20:10,676 --> 01:20:12,439
There's an old saying:

808
01:20:12,878 --> 01:20:15,745
"Raise no more devils
than you can lay down."

809
01:20:15,948 --> 01:20:18,280
My father raised one too many.

810
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:28,683
<i>Calling all units. Reported 10-50</i>
<i>in the downtown area.</i>

811
01:20:28,894 --> 01:20:29,883
<i>Proceed with caution.</i>

812
01:21:30,923 --> 01:21:32,356
He's coming for us.

813
01:21:32,758 --> 01:21:34,055
Abigor.

814
01:21:34,927 --> 01:21:36,189
You know what to do.

815
01:21:45,704 --> 01:21:48,298
<i>Rider.</i>

816
01:22:12,965 --> 01:22:16,833
I have a suspect fleeing west
on Cherry. Repeat, west on Cherry.

817
01:22:18,503 --> 01:22:20,994
- <i>That's a dead end. You got him.</i>
- 10-4 on that.

818
01:22:27,446 --> 01:22:28,936
<i>What's the suspect's location?</i>

819
01:22:29,147 --> 01:22:30,375
- Up.
- <i>What?</i>

820
01:22:30,582 --> 01:22:33,449
The suspect is going up.

821
01:22:53,138 --> 01:22:54,537
Oh, my God.

822
01:23:08,654 --> 01:23:09,951
People, help me.

823
01:23:10,188 --> 01:23:11,553
Go, go, go!

824
01:23:11,757 --> 01:23:14,658
Surround him!
Make a perimeter! Let's go!

825
01:23:26,038 --> 01:23:27,528
<i>Come in, please.</i>

826
01:23:41,153 --> 01:23:43,348
- Come here!
- No!

827
01:23:44,056 --> 01:23:45,921
You're pissing me off.

828
01:23:46,458 --> 01:23:47,857
Okay, okay.

829
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:49,254
Sorry.

830
01:24:00,806 --> 01:24:02,103
Take a right.

831
01:24:10,916 --> 01:24:12,850
You should've joined us, Rider.

832
01:24:13,051 --> 01:24:14,575
Soon we will have the contract...

833
01:24:14,786 --> 01:24:18,745
...and then you'll only be a footnote
in the history of the new hell.

834
01:24:22,728 --> 01:24:24,753
Time to clear the air.

835
01:24:37,709 --> 01:24:39,836
You're a slow learner,
aren't you, Rider?

836
01:24:41,446 --> 01:24:43,414
You cannot catch the wind!

837
01:24:54,826 --> 01:24:58,125
No!

838
01:25:32,831 --> 01:25:34,128
Oh, my God.

839
01:26:09,668 --> 01:26:11,033
Johnny.

840
01:26:17,542 --> 01:26:18,975
Prepare to fire!

841
01:26:22,481 --> 01:26:23,709
- Fire!
- Don't!

842
01:27:30,081 --> 01:27:31,309
They know who I am.

843
01:27:31,950 --> 01:27:34,612
- Who's that?
- What? Everybody.

844
01:27:34,986 --> 01:27:37,045
You don't watch TV?
What's the matter with you?

845
01:27:41,092 --> 01:27:42,821
Is this thing ever gonna end?

846
01:27:43,028 --> 01:27:45,087
It'll end if you can catch him.

847
01:27:45,497 --> 01:27:46,896
What's really going on?

848
01:28:08,119 --> 01:28:10,747
- Anything good on?
- How can I help you, captain?

849
01:28:10,956 --> 01:28:12,389
Get out.

850
01:28:13,858 --> 01:28:16,520
We brought a friend of yours
in for questioning last night...

851
01:28:16,728 --> 01:28:19,492
...and now he seems
to have disappeared.

852
01:28:19,698 --> 01:28:22,633
Has Johnny Blaze tried
to contact you in any way, ma'am?

853
01:28:22,834 --> 01:28:24,927
Sorry. Can't help, guys.

854
01:28:29,307 --> 01:28:33,437
Look, I don't pretend to know
what the hell that thing is...

855
01:28:33,645 --> 01:28:36,079
...but I do know that Blaze
is wrapped up in it.

856
01:28:36,281 --> 01:28:40,911
And the only way you can save him
now is if you help us find him.

857
01:28:42,687 --> 01:28:47,215
You got six hours. After that we go
public with everything we got.

858
01:28:48,426 --> 01:28:49,791
Six hours.

859
01:29:04,676 --> 01:29:06,303
"Carter Slade."

860
01:29:07,345 --> 01:29:11,805
Legend has it he was
a Texas Ranger. Man of honor.

861
01:29:13,351 --> 01:29:14,978
But he got greedy.

862
01:29:15,387 --> 01:29:19,949
Found himself locked up,
waiting on the gallows.

863
01:29:20,659 --> 01:29:22,524
Stranger came to see him.

864
01:29:23,061 --> 01:29:24,756
Offering freedom.

865
01:29:25,797 --> 01:29:27,594
Slade made a deal.

866
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,231
Ended up a Ghost Rider.

867
01:29:30,835 --> 01:29:32,530
What's he gotta do with this?

868
01:29:32,871 --> 01:29:34,805
Remember that contract
the stranger made...

869
01:29:35,006 --> 01:29:37,167
...with the people of San Venganza?

870
01:29:37,742 --> 01:29:42,042
The story goes that Slade
was sent there to collect all the souls.

871
01:29:43,148 --> 01:29:45,878
But what he found there was so evil...

872
01:29:46,084 --> 01:29:49,485
...that he took the contract
and rode off.

873
01:29:49,988 --> 01:29:51,649
He stole it.

874
01:29:52,023 --> 01:29:54,890
Keep Mephistopheles
from getting his hands on it.

875
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:58,490
Some people say
he was buried with it.

876
01:29:58,697 --> 01:30:00,892
- Was he?
- I don't know.

877
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:06,969
What I do know is that Blackheart is
coming, and he'll do anything to get it.

878
01:30:07,505 --> 01:30:11,441
That's why it's important for you to
stay away from friends and family...

879
01:30:11,643 --> 01:30:14,441
...anybody he can use against you,
because he will.

880
01:30:14,946 --> 01:30:15,913
Roxanne.

881
01:30:27,125 --> 01:30:28,319
Johnny?

882
01:30:34,532 --> 01:30:35,726
Johnny?

883
01:30:35,967 --> 01:30:37,127
God!

884
01:30:38,937 --> 01:30:40,268
Sorry! Sorry!

885
01:30:40,705 --> 01:30:42,036
Ma'am, you gave me a start.

886
01:30:42,774 --> 01:30:46,141
- I'm looking for Johnny.
- Yeah. You and me both.

887
01:30:46,945 --> 01:30:48,742
- Have you heard from him?
- No.

888
01:30:48,947 --> 01:30:50,881
But I heard he got in trouble.

889
01:30:52,217 --> 01:30:55,015
He got arrested, yeah? What for?

890
01:30:55,620 --> 01:30:59,147
Yeah, well, if this gets out in
the press, his career is over.

891
01:30:59,357 --> 01:31:02,121
Yeah, trust me, his career's
the least of it.

892
01:31:02,527 --> 01:31:05,394
You know, you seem like a nice lady,
and you're pretty and all...

893
01:31:05,597 --> 01:31:08,122
...but we were riding the gravy train
on biscuit wheels...

894
01:31:08,333 --> 01:31:10,358
...then you showed up,
everything went to hell.

895
01:31:10,568 --> 01:31:13,162
So why don't you go back
to wherever it is you came from?

896
01:31:14,172 --> 01:31:16,640
I can't go back. Not now.

897
01:31:17,575 --> 01:31:19,475
Then tell me what the hell's going on!

898
01:31:20,245 --> 01:31:22,713
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

899
01:31:23,348 --> 01:31:25,976
Look, you don't know me...

900
01:31:26,184 --> 01:31:27,310
...but I love him.

901
01:31:27,519 --> 01:31:31,819
So if there's anything you know
that can help, anything...

902
01:31:34,793 --> 01:31:37,387
Lately, he's been reading
these really weird books...

903
01:31:37,595 --> 01:31:39,290
...and they're messing with his mind.

904
01:31:39,497 --> 01:31:43,297
He's writing stuff down and staying up
late. And he does it over here.

905
01:31:43,501 --> 01:31:46,595
You can go through this stuff,
and I don't know if it means anything.

906
01:32:38,756 --> 01:32:40,849
This is hallowed ground.

907
01:32:50,001 --> 01:32:52,128
Did you think I was like
the others?

908
01:32:53,037 --> 01:32:57,303
I have all of my father's strengths
and none of his weaknesses.

909
01:32:59,077 --> 01:33:01,671
The new hell is in San Venganza.

910
01:33:02,947 --> 01:33:04,881
I need the contract.

911
01:33:05,416 --> 01:33:07,316
I know it's here.

912
01:33:13,224 --> 01:33:15,089
Now give it to me.

913
01:33:25,203 --> 01:33:27,228
Give it to me.

914
01:33:28,706 --> 01:33:30,571
Give it to me.

915
01:33:30,775 --> 01:33:33,539
Give it to me. Give it to me.
Give it to me.

916
01:33:48,893 --> 01:33:50,861
You're gonna fall.

917
01:33:51,462 --> 01:33:53,521
Just like your father.

918
01:34:20,058 --> 01:34:23,255
The Rider, where is he?

919
01:34:23,728 --> 01:34:25,161
Gone!

920
01:34:30,535 --> 01:34:31,627
The girl.

921
01:34:32,003 --> 01:34:35,632
You hurt her, he'll be there
like lightning before the storm.

922
01:34:38,876 --> 01:34:40,434
I'm counting on it.

923
01:34:48,186 --> 01:34:49,278
Where's Roxanne?

924
01:34:49,487 --> 01:34:51,648
Dude. Where've you been?
Everybody's out looking--

925
01:34:51,856 --> 01:34:54,916
- Where is she?
- She's out looking for you.

926
01:35:14,012 --> 01:35:15,138
Jesus.

927
01:35:15,346 --> 01:35:16,745
Not even close.

928
01:35:24,989 --> 01:35:26,547
You have his heart.

929
01:35:31,929 --> 01:35:33,760
Now I'm gonna break it.

930
01:35:36,367 --> 01:35:37,334
Roxanne?

931
01:35:42,974 --> 01:35:44,100
Mack.

932
01:35:47,011 --> 01:35:47,978
Roxanne.

933
01:35:57,121 --> 01:35:59,180
Look into my eyes.

934
01:36:06,464 --> 01:36:08,898
Your Penance Stare
doesn't work on me.

935
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:11,500
I have no soul to burn.

936
01:36:12,904 --> 01:36:15,873
I guess the Caretaker
forgot to mention that, huh?

937
01:36:16,307 --> 01:36:17,535
Surprise!

938
01:36:18,276 --> 01:36:19,971
He sent you to bring me back.

939
01:36:20,645 --> 01:36:22,476
I'm not going back.

940
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:24,511
I like it here.

941
01:36:27,952 --> 01:36:29,715
He thinks you're better than me?

942
01:36:29,921 --> 01:36:33,118
I don't know who's more pathetic,
you or him.

943
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:40,156
Now, listen to me. And try to get it
through that thick skull of yours.

944
01:36:40,364 --> 01:36:43,822
You don't work for my father anymore.
You work for me.

945
01:36:44,202 --> 01:36:46,397
Get the contract from the Caretaker.

946
01:36:46,604 --> 01:36:51,564
Bring it to me in San Venganza
and maybe I'll spare your girl's life.

947
01:36:52,210 --> 01:36:53,609
And, Johnny...

948
01:36:58,516 --> 01:37:00,040
...don't make me wait.

949
01:37:18,936 --> 01:37:20,528
What happened?

950
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:24,538
- Blackheart.
- They got her.

951
01:37:24,809 --> 01:37:27,277
Where's the contract?
I can't end this without it.

952
01:37:30,515 --> 01:37:33,484
Just gonna have to dig
this whole damn place up myself.

953
01:37:36,454 --> 01:37:37,785
It's not there, kid.

954
01:37:49,934 --> 01:37:51,959
Contract of San Venganza.

955
01:37:52,336 --> 01:37:53,803
Hell on earth.

956
01:37:56,274 --> 01:37:58,139
Now, you're gonna have to trust me.

957
01:37:59,010 --> 01:38:00,375
And why is that?

958
01:38:01,612 --> 01:38:03,580
He may have my soul...

959
01:38:04,982 --> 01:38:06,745
...but he doesn't have my spirit.

960
01:38:12,957 --> 01:38:16,723
Any man who's got the guts
to sell his soul for love...

961
01:38:17,028 --> 01:38:19,360
...got the power to change the world.

962
01:38:20,264 --> 01:38:22,061
You didn't do it for greed.

963
01:38:22,834 --> 01:38:24,825
You did it for the right reason.

964
01:38:25,703 --> 01:38:27,671
Maybe that puts God on your side.

965
01:38:28,506 --> 01:38:30,667
To him, that makes you dangerous.

966
01:38:30,875 --> 01:38:32,809
Makes you unpredictable.

967
01:38:33,511 --> 01:38:35,911
That's the best thing
you can be right now.

968
01:38:38,816 --> 01:38:41,910
San Venganza's 500 miles from here.

969
01:38:43,287 --> 01:38:44,914
We better get moving.

970
01:38:47,358 --> 01:38:48,552
"We"?

971
01:39:10,681 --> 01:39:13,206
I got one last ride left in me.

972
01:39:25,029 --> 01:39:26,553
Carter Slade.

973
01:39:30,768 --> 01:39:32,235
Can you keep up?

974
01:39:41,045 --> 01:39:42,535
Let's ride.

975
01:40:27,158 --> 01:40:29,285
Stick to the shadows.

976
01:40:47,278 --> 01:40:49,746
This is the end of the trail for me.

977
01:40:50,348 --> 01:40:52,111
I got nothing left.

978
01:40:52,850 --> 01:40:56,616
I could only change one more time,
and I was saving it for this.

979
01:41:01,325 --> 01:41:04,294
God knows I've made
my share of mistakes.

980
01:41:05,496 --> 01:41:08,226
Been trying to make things right
ever since.

981
01:41:09,633 --> 01:41:14,127
Guess all I can do now is hope he
sees fit to give me a second chance.

982
01:41:14,905 --> 01:41:16,065
Thank you.

983
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:17,964
No.

984
01:41:18,242 --> 01:41:19,766
Thank you, kid.

985
01:41:35,559 --> 01:41:37,527
The Rider is coming.

986
01:41:38,529 --> 01:41:41,157
Coming to save you.

987
01:41:42,133 --> 01:41:45,193
You think you can stop him?
Nothing can stop him.

988
01:41:45,770 --> 01:41:47,829
He's running out of time.

989
01:41:48,639 --> 01:41:49,867
I'll make sure of it.

990
01:41:54,211 --> 01:41:57,339
It's almost dawn. Slow him down.

991
01:41:59,350 --> 01:42:05,084
- What?
- Slow him down.

992
01:43:21,866 --> 01:43:23,026
Surprise.

993
01:44:37,675 --> 01:44:38,801
Stop.

994
01:44:39,009 --> 01:44:41,307
You change, she dies.

995
01:44:42,780 --> 01:44:43,747
Do it, Johnny.

996
01:44:52,089 --> 01:44:53,454
Let her go first.

997
01:45:50,748 --> 01:45:52,375
Looks like you're out of time.

998
01:46:24,214 --> 01:46:27,206
"This is the contract of San Venganza.

999
01:46:30,821 --> 01:46:32,254
All of you...

1000
01:46:32,923 --> 01:46:35,551
...come to me!"

1001
01:47:31,482 --> 01:47:32,608
Johnny!

1002
01:47:46,997 --> 01:47:50,626
My name is Legion...

1003
01:47:52,236 --> 01:47:54,067
...for we are...

1004
01:47:55,439 --> 01:47:59,466
...many.

1005
01:48:00,844 --> 01:48:03,472
Let's go. He got what he wanted.

1006
01:48:05,883 --> 01:48:10,343
You go. I gotta get him to
the shadows. I gotta end this.

1007
01:48:11,155 --> 01:48:12,918
Why? Why you?

1008
01:48:13,123 --> 01:48:15,956
It's been me since the day
I made the deal.

1009
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:19,061
I'm the only one
who can walk in both worlds.

1010
01:48:19,596 --> 01:48:21,063
I'm Ghost Rider.

1011
01:48:25,569 --> 01:48:26,536
Run!

1012
01:48:37,214 --> 01:48:38,442
Come on, you son of a bitch.

1013
01:49:01,271 --> 01:49:02,533
All of your world...

1014
01:49:02,739 --> 01:49:04,570
...all of your souls...

1015
01:49:04,775 --> 01:49:07,403
...will be mine now.

1016
01:49:21,825 --> 01:49:23,520
- Throw me the gun!
- It's out!

1017
01:49:25,128 --> 01:49:26,254
Throw it!

1018
01:50:24,688 --> 01:50:28,055
How does it feel to have
all that evil inside of you?

1019
01:50:28,258 --> 01:50:29,657
All their power.

1020
01:50:30,827 --> 01:50:32,795
All their souls.

1021
01:50:33,697 --> 01:50:36,131
A thousand souls to burn.

1022
01:50:36,333 --> 01:50:38,893
Look into my eyes.

1023
01:50:39,102 --> 01:50:42,629
Your souls are stained
by the blood of the innocent.

1024
01:50:42,839 --> 01:50:44,670
No.

1025
01:50:44,875 --> 01:50:46,467
Feel their pain.

1026
01:50:57,754 --> 01:51:00,086
--Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

1027
01:51:00,290 --> 01:51:01,450
Kill you!

1028
01:51:05,095 --> 01:51:06,289
Stop it!

1029
01:51:08,832 --> 01:51:10,060
Oh, God!

1030
01:51:50,574 --> 01:51:51,973
Monster.

1031
01:51:53,410 --> 01:51:54,934
I'm not afraid.

1032
01:52:20,037 --> 01:52:22,164
Congratulations, Johnny.

1033
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:26,108
You upheld your end of the bargain.

1034
01:52:27,544 --> 01:52:30,707
It's time I take back
the power of the Ghost Rider.

1035
01:52:31,848 --> 01:52:33,645
You get your life back.

1036
01:52:34,584 --> 01:52:36,449
The love you've always wanted.

1037
01:52:36,887 --> 01:52:39,321
You can start a family of your own.

1038
01:52:40,357 --> 01:52:42,518
There are more deals to be made.

1039
01:52:43,026 --> 01:52:47,554
More people willing to give their souls
for what they desire.

1040
01:52:48,031 --> 01:52:51,831
Let someone else carry this curse.
You're free now.

1041
01:52:53,136 --> 01:52:54,603
After all...

1042
01:52:55,372 --> 01:52:57,237
...a deal's a deal.

1043
01:53:10,253 --> 01:53:11,220
No.

1044
01:53:13,123 --> 01:53:15,591
I'm gonna own this curse...

1045
01:53:16,893 --> 01:53:19,361
...and I'm gonna use it against you.

1046
01:53:20,263 --> 01:53:22,857
Whenever innocent blood is spilt...

1047
01:53:23,400 --> 01:53:25,766
...it'll be my father's blood...

1048
01:53:27,504 --> 01:53:29,699
...and you'll find me there.

1049
01:53:30,240 --> 01:53:32,401
A spirit of vengeance...

1050
01:53:33,243 --> 01:53:36,178
...fighting fire with fire.

1051
01:53:37,614 --> 01:53:40,310
I will make you pay for this.

1052
01:53:41,284 --> 01:53:43,252
You can't live in fear.

1053
01:53:45,322 --> 01:53:47,415
No!

1054
01:54:10,680 --> 01:54:13,080
So where will you go now?

1055
01:54:14,384 --> 01:54:16,852
Wherever the road takes me, I guess.

1056
01:54:20,824 --> 01:54:24,760
My daddy once said, "If you don't
make a choice, the choice makes you."

1057
01:54:25,195 --> 01:54:29,359
Yeah. But why do your choices
always keep us apart?

1058
01:54:43,346 --> 01:54:45,473
Sure wish things could have
turned out different.

1059
01:54:47,083 --> 01:54:50,052
No. This is what you are.

1060
01:54:50,253 --> 01:54:52,881
This is what
you always were meant to be.

1061
01:54:53,657 --> 01:54:55,124
You got your second chance.

1062
01:54:55,926 --> 01:54:57,985
Go out there and make the best of it.

1063
01:55:26,523 --> 01:55:30,084
<i>It's said that the West</i>
<i>was built on legends...</i>

1064
01:55:31,394 --> 01:55:33,919
<i>...and that legends are</i>
<i>a way of understanding...</i>

1065
01:55:34,130 --> 01:55:36,690
<i>...things greater than ourselves.</i>

1066
01:55:37,067 --> 01:55:39,331
<i>Forces that shape our lives.</i>

1067
01:55:39,536 --> 01:55:42,903
<i>Events that defy explanation.</i>

1068
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:47,703
<i>Individuals whose lives</i>
<i>soar to the heavens...</i>

1069
01:55:47,911 --> 01:55:49,879
<i>...or fall to the earth.</i>

1070
01:55:50,347 --> 01:55:53,839
<i>This is how legends are born.</i>
