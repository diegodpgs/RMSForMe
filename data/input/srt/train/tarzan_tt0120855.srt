[Jane ] Well, he didn't stand upright,
he sort of crouched, like that.

- Really ?
- Supported his weight on his knuckles.

Ah, it was amazing !

And he bends his elbows out like this,
and then he walks like this.

Oh, Janey, Jane !

- He was this close, Daddy !
Staring at me.

He seemed confused

as if he's never seen
another human before.

His eyes were intense,
