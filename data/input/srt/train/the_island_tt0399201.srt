1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:25,199
Greetz From DownTYU

2
00:01:57,085 --> 00:01:58,677
You're special.

3
00:01:59,955 --> 00:02:03,584
You have a very special purpose in life.

4
00:02:05,894 --> 00:02:07,361
You've been chosen.

5
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:21,275
The Island awaits you.

6
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:14,260
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

7
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:44,291
Good morning, Tower One.

8
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:47,954
Exterior contamination index is 85 percent.

9
00:03:48,029 --> 00:03:49,519
Sunny and mild.

10
00:04:00,642 --> 00:04:02,633
Hey, I'm missing a left shoe.

11
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:09,082
And when you get a chance,
I'd like another color.

12
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:22,429
- Morning.
- Good morning.

13
00:04:30,405 --> 00:04:33,636
- Hey, Lincoln. How you doing?
- I'm missing a shoe.

14
00:04:44,052 --> 00:04:46,850
- Hey, you're cutting.
- Yeah.

15
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:49,681
Thank you.

16
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:52,656
We're full.

17
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,493
Good morning.
July 19th, 2019.

18
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:01,831
Another day in paradise.

19
00:05:15,717 --> 00:05:17,947
Starkweather Two Delta,

20
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:19,384
your time has come.

21
00:05:19,454 --> 00:05:22,423
You're moving out to the Island.

22
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,458
Starkweather Two Delta here.

23
00:05:24,526 --> 00:05:27,927
And, as you know, the biggest dream
of my life just came true.

24
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:30,726
I've only been with you guys
for, like, six months,

25
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:32,562
but I won the lottery.

26
00:05:32,634 --> 00:05:35,262
- That's right, me, Starkweather, OK?
- Six months.

27
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:39,830
To go out and breathe fresh air, swim in the ocean...

28
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:44,071
I can't believe I won. You call me Mr. Popular, I know.

29
00:05:44,179 --> 00:05:46,841
It's me. It's me.

30
00:05:46,915 --> 00:05:51,545
You guys know I'm not like this, but this is just amazing.

31
00:05:52,387 --> 00:05:55,083
I'm going to the Island!
We're gonna have so much fun!

32
00:05:55,156 --> 00:05:59,092
But I need to see you guys out there.
You can do it! I won!

33
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,457
That was this week's...

34
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:03,088
We got a disturbance
on elevator 12, plaza level.

35
00:06:03,164 --> 00:06:06,895
...just moments before his final departure to the Island,

36
00:06:06,968 --> 00:06:10,028
nature's last remaining
pathogen-free zone.

37
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:12,334
- Lucky guy, huh?
- You can be a winner too.

38
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,500
The next lottery is tonight.

39
00:06:16,845 --> 00:06:20,508
The next lottery is tonight.

40
00:06:22,784 --> 00:06:25,651
- How long have you been here?
- Two years.

41
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:29,288
- What about you?
- Three.

42
00:06:29,357 --> 00:06:31,348
Three. I've been here seven.

43
00:06:31,426 --> 00:06:35,692
If  I do the math, that makes me the biggest lottery loser in the room.

44
00:06:37,232 --> 00:06:39,962
I'm such a loser.

45
00:07:09,731 --> 00:07:12,063
Sir.

46
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:14,124
Yeah, you.

47
00:07:16,137 --> 00:07:17,695
Swipe.

48
00:07:19,207 --> 00:07:22,734
Gandu Three Echo, you've been flagged for public disturbance before.

49
00:07:22,844 --> 00:07:25,813
Yes, I had a very small emotional outburst, sir.

50
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,474
- Safe to say it's over?
- Yes, very safe.

51
00:07:29,384 --> 00:07:32,581
- I'm feeling much better.
- Well, then, have a pleasant day.

52
00:07:32,654 --> 00:07:35,521
Thank you, you too. You both have a pleasant day too.

53
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,946
Feel the stretch.

54
00:08:01,616 --> 00:08:02,913
One more breath in.

55
00:08:19,467 --> 00:08:21,230
But I was in that section.

56
00:08:21,302 --> 00:08:22,894
No, I don't understand!

57
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:25,599
- I tried! I tried to do the best l...
- Listen to me!

58
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:31,578
Remember, be polite,
pleasant and peaceful.

59
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:35,479
A healthy person is a happy person.

60
00:08:42,223 --> 00:08:46,125
Lincoln Six Echo, choices are fruit,
oatmeal and any type of bran.

61
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:47,684
No bacon today?

62
00:08:47,762 --> 00:08:49,957
You got a nutrition flag,
means no bacon.

63
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:52,556
In that case, two eggs,
over easy, not too runny,

64
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,066
and a side of sausages.

65
00:08:54,135 --> 00:08:56,968
Maybe some French toast
and a little powdered sugar.

66
00:08:57,739 --> 00:09:01,470
You ain't cute and I got no time
for your lip, Six Echo.

67
00:09:01,576 --> 00:09:03,476
Now, what's it gonna be?

68
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:04,602
Move it.

69
00:09:07,482 --> 00:09:08,779
Surprise me.

70
00:09:14,489 --> 00:09:15,547
Surprise.

71
00:09:17,158 --> 00:09:19,820
Yummy. Next.

72
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:34,403
Watch and learn.

73
00:09:35,343 --> 00:09:37,004
Next.

74
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:39,545
Jordan Two Delta.

75
00:09:39,614 --> 00:09:41,172
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

76
00:09:41,282 --> 00:09:44,774
Choices are powdered eggs,
dried fruit and yogurt.

77
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:47,719
- Eggs, please.
- OK.

78
00:09:49,424 --> 00:09:52,188
So, where were you the other day?
We missed you.

79
00:09:52,894 --> 00:09:55,954
That's nice of you to say, sweetheart.

80
00:09:56,631 --> 00:09:58,258
Get you anything else?

81
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:00,529
Maybe a little bacon.

82
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:03,194
No, it says I shouldn't.

83
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:07,002
- Go ahead.
- Four, five pieces, please.

84
00:10:08,743 --> 00:10:10,040
Thank you.

85
00:10:11,813 --> 00:10:13,804
Well, good luck.
Gotta run along now.

86
00:10:13,915 --> 00:10:17,146
You're not going.
You gotta stay for dinner.

87
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:19,880
- I softened her up for you.
- No doubt.

88
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:22,650
- Back on your diet?
- You kidding? I love this stuff.

89
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:25,487
Better eat up. You'll need all your strength tonight.

90
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,754
Is  that a challenge?

91
00:10:26,828 --> 00:10:29,456
I promise I'll go easy on you.

92
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:35,266
Please separate.
Find your seats now.

93
00:10:35,336 --> 00:10:37,270
Yeah.

94
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:42,974
"'Who wants Sally?' said Dick.
'I do,' said Jane.

95
00:10:43,044 --> 00:10:45,842
'I cannot find Sally.

96
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:50,612
Get up, Dick.
Get up and help me find Sally.

97
00:10:50,685 --> 00:10:53,279
Is  Sally here?"'

98
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:08,263
Dr. Merrick will see you now.

99
00:11:12,707 --> 00:11:15,540
What'd you do wrong this time,
tough guy?

100
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:21,210
Sir?

101
00:11:21,282 --> 00:11:26,083
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes. Please.

102
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:36,696
Please, sit down.

103
00:11:37,498 --> 00:11:40,160
So, how is Lincoln Six Echo today?

104
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:42,794
Not so good, I guess.

105
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,861
Why do you say that?

106
00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:47,737
Well, if I'm here,
it means I'm not so good.

107
00:11:47,842 --> 00:11:50,834
That's a rather negative association.

108
00:11:50,945 --> 00:11:55,348
My only job is to see that you're happy,
things are OK with you.

109
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,008
Right.

110
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:03,281
Your file shows that you've
been interacting regularly

111
00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:04,654
with Jordan Two Delta.

112
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:08,661
- There's no law against friendship.
- No. No, we encourage it,

113
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:13,132
but, obviously,
proximity could become a concern.

114
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:15,169
I know the rules of proximity.

115
00:12:17,505 --> 00:12:20,167
You've been doing quite well
in most other areas.

116
00:12:20,274 --> 00:12:23,266
Proficient at work,
exercising rigorously.

117
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:26,904
But screening has picked up
some trace levels,

118
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:31,110
changes in your metabolism,
and you've been having nightmares.

119
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:33,983
Are you saying there's
something wrong with me?

120
00:12:34,055 --> 00:12:36,649
Why don't you tell me
about your dream?

121
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:41,761
Well, it's the same dream every time.
I'm on a boat, headed to the Island.

122
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:45,094
A boat? What kind of boat?

123
00:12:46,634 --> 00:12:47,965
A nice boat.

124
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:49,593
Draw it for me, would you?

125
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:58,545
So, you are heading
toward the Island.

126
00:12:58,613 --> 00:13:00,604
What happens then?

127
00:13:00,715 --> 00:13:03,548
- I drown.
- Really?

128
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:07,578
- Why do you think that is?
- I don't know. You tell me.

129
00:13:07,655 --> 00:13:10,681
- Maybe you're afraid of winning.
- Why would I be afraid?

130
00:13:10,758 --> 00:13:12,623
You tell me.

131
00:13:17,365 --> 00:13:19,731
What's troubling you, Lincoln?

132
00:13:21,936 --> 00:13:23,801
Well, it's...

133
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:26,032
It's just...

134
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:29,105
All right.
Tuesday night is tofu night.

135
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,509
And I'm asking myself, who decided
that everyone here likes tofu

136
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,174
in the first place?
And what is tofu, anyway?

137
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:38,446
And why can't I have bacon?
I line up every morning,

138
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,454
and I'm not allowed any bacon
for my breakfast.

139
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:43,683
And...
Let's talk about all the white.

140
00:13:43,758 --> 00:13:45,953
Why is everyone
wearing white all the time?

141
00:13:46,027 --> 00:13:49,690
It's impossible to keep clean.
I always get the gray stripe.

142
00:13:49,764 --> 00:13:52,460
I never get any color.
And I hand it in to be cleaned,

143
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:56,594
and someone cleans it, and folds it
neatly back in my drawer, but who?

144
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:59,538
Who is that person? I don't know.

145
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,335
I just... I wanna know answers.

146
00:14:01,442 --> 00:14:04,172
And I wish that there was more.

147
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:07,244
- More?
- Yeah.

148
00:14:07,315 --> 00:14:11,615
More than just waiting
to go to the Island.

149
00:14:14,422 --> 00:14:16,754
Lincoln,

150
00:14:16,824 --> 00:14:19,657
it's your nature
to question things.

151
00:14:19,727 --> 00:14:24,596
But don't you realize how lucky you are?
That you survived the contamination.

152
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:28,863
That nature has left you
a Garden of Eden to repopulate.

153
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:32,167
That, Lincoln, is your purpose.

154
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:40,002
Right. And you?
Aren't you going to the Island too?

155
00:14:40,114 --> 00:14:42,514
No.

156
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,814
My responsibility is to make sure

157
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:48,184
this facility continues to operate.

158
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:53,887
That's why people like me,
my staff and supervisors, we...

159
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:56,623
...we can't win the lottery.

160
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:01,498
Let me see that.

161
00:15:03,604 --> 00:15:05,435
You draw well.

162
00:15:05,506 --> 00:15:08,475
"Renovatio."
What does that mean?

163
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:10,806
I don't know.
It's always in my dream.

164
00:15:13,147 --> 00:15:15,615
I'd like to run some tests
on you, Lincoln.

165
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:17,850
What sort of tests?

166
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:21,279
Nice tests.

167
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:22,686
Come with me.

168
00:15:29,797 --> 00:15:31,560
Take a seat.

169
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,663
OK, let's get you comfortable.

170
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:40,229
Swing back.

171
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:48,415
- I thought these were nice tests.
- It's a synaptic brain scan.

172
00:15:48,482 --> 00:15:50,677
Totally harmless.

173
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:53,720
Don't worry, it's painless.

174
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:16,199
- It hurts.
- Not really.

175
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,005
- Yeah, it does!
- No, it doesn't.

176
00:16:18,112 --> 00:16:20,410
Yeah, it really, really does!

177
00:16:25,553 --> 00:16:28,750
The micro-sensors
will move along your optic nerve.

178
00:16:28,823 --> 00:16:32,156
They'll be uploading readings
to us over the next 24 hours,

179
00:16:32,226 --> 00:16:34,922
after which,
you'll pass them through your urine.

180
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:37,122
Now, that might hurt.

181
00:16:48,476 --> 00:16:50,137
Six Echo, you're late.

182
00:17:04,992 --> 00:17:06,983
Jones, you ever get bored doing this?

183
00:17:07,061 --> 00:17:08,289
- Doing what?
- This.

184
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:11,354
- I never really thought about it.
- I think about it a lot.

185
00:17:11,432 --> 00:17:13,400
- About what?
- This boring job.

186
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:16,630
- What are we doing here?
- We're feeding the nutrient lines.

187
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:20,333
We eat food, food's gotta have
vitamins, right? It's good for us.

188
00:17:20,441 --> 00:17:23,069
You don't ever wonder about anything?

189
00:17:23,177 --> 00:17:25,645
Where do these tubes go?

190
00:17:26,881 --> 00:17:28,314
They start there.

191
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:31,317
And they go... right there.

192
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:35,454
Hey. Did you get a look
at the new guy?

193
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:37,582
Seven Foxtrot.

194
00:17:37,658 --> 00:17:41,424
They found another survivor.
They keep finding them.

195
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:43,156
He'll probably win the lottery.

196
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,495
Straight down, in the hole.
There you go, you try it.

197
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:49,866
Straight down in the hole.

198
00:17:49,937 --> 00:17:53,771
In the hole.
No, no, no. Put it down.

199
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:57,275
Did we all look that stupid
when we went through decontamination?

200
00:17:57,344 --> 00:18:01,872
Hey, Mr. Man-With-All-The-Questions,
let me ask you this:

201
00:18:02,683 --> 00:18:04,878
Lottery's supposed
to be random, right?

202
00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:06,044
Right.

203
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,452
What if it's not?
What if it's rigged?

204
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:10,349
Rigged?

205
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:13,918
I've been working on this. Here.

206
00:18:13,994 --> 00:18:15,985
Take a look at that.

207
00:18:16,664 --> 00:18:19,690
It charts the last 20 people
that won a spot on the Island.

208
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:23,066
Excluding, of course, the women,
picked to be breeders.

209
00:18:23,137 --> 00:18:26,072
- What is this?
- I took the first letter in each name.

210
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:29,267
I assigned it a point value system,
based on the alphabet,

211
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:31,810
like the last guy,
Starkweather, S equals 15.

212
00:18:31,879 --> 00:18:33,540
Q equals 15, S equals 19.

213
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:35,707
- Do you see what I'm saying?
- No.

214
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:39,275
Well, maybe if you would listen to me,
I'm trying to tell you.

215
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:42,754
You string the numbers together.
You divide it by the amount...

216
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:46,224
You multiply... You divide it by
the amount of... You divide it...

217
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:50,787
You divide it by the amount of people,
which is 25, a thousand plus five, 2500.

218
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:54,630
You know what that spells?
J-O-N-E-S.

219
00:18:55,603 --> 00:18:58,333
- I'm winning the lottery tonight.
- Did you pack?

220
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:01,240
- No.
- Gentlemen,

221
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:04,736
I'm gonna go mess with Foxtrot.

222
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:06,938
There you go. Straight.

223
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:09,311
Straight down in the hole.

224
00:19:09,383 --> 00:19:11,248
- There you go.
- Straight...

225
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,415
- What? He had something on his... OK.
- Go.

226
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:22,524
Lima! Are you OK?
What's wrong?

227
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:26,225
Code 15, we need med-techs stat!
Lima One Alpha.

228
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,029
Let's give her some air, OK?

229
00:19:28,102 --> 00:19:30,730
You're gonna be OK, all right?
Relax and breathe.

230
00:19:30,804 --> 00:19:33,432
Can I get a wheelchair?
It's for Lima One Alpha.

231
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,998
- You OK?
- I think it's time.

232
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:42,537
Lima, you're going to the Island.

233
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:45,619
- We're going.
- Oh, you're so lucky.

234
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:47,586
I hope I see you soon.

235
00:19:50,257 --> 00:19:55,126
Everyone, please follow her out.
Quickly and carefully. Watch the glass.

236
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,322
- Good luck, Lima.
- Thank you.

237
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:04,136
That's fair. That's real fair.

238
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:07,662
Ladies, ladies, push back, please.
Gentlemen. Thank you.

239
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:13,810
Everyone, back to work.

240
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:15,849
That is so not fair.

241
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:20,747
Oh, man, I hate this jealousy thing.
It's giving me heart palpitations.

242
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:22,880
Tech Services.

243
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:24,753
Computer's down again.

244
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:27,684
I'm down.
Computer guy's in Sector Six.

245
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:31,162
I have to deal with this mess.
Take my Tri-Key. Contamination kit.

246
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,324
- Hurry back.
- Absolutely.

247
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:04,921
- Hey! What are you doing?
- I'm gonna see this guy.

248
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:09,967
Hey, chief. We got live wires
all over the place here.

249
00:21:10,037 --> 00:21:13,268
Hey, I've been looking all over for you.

250
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:15,533
- What?
- I've been looking...

251
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:18,543
- Can't hear you.
- I've been looking all over for you.

252
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:23,015
If  you go and get yourself contaminated,
don't come pointing the finger at me.

253
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,345
How you doing, Mac?

254
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:27,646
- What are you doing here?
- My chip fried again.

255
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:30,656
Yeah. How much longer
do you think that one's gonna work?

256
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,054
- What are you two clowns looking at?
- Hey,

257
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,189
you got any of that stuff
on you today?

258
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:41,629
Oh, look, it's break time.
Come on.

259
00:21:43,237 --> 00:21:46,206
You're a bad influence on me.

260
00:21:46,273 --> 00:21:49,208
Must be why I like you so much.

261
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:56,272
What's it like where you live?
In Sector Five?

262
00:21:57,351 --> 00:22:00,980
It's fine. You know,
it's like any other sector, I guess.

263
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:07,316
I like coming out here, talking.

264
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:10,056
Most supervisors don't like to talk.

265
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,256
Yeah.

266
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,891
Step into my office.

267
00:22:21,308 --> 00:22:24,277
- Are these your friends?
- Yeah, sometimes.

268
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:26,278
Where are their clothes?

269
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:27,643
What's with Dr. Merrick?

270
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:32,378
You mean why does he act like he's
got a filing cabinet shoved up his ass?

271
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:33,544
Yeah.

272
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,918
It's called a God complex.

273
00:22:35,989 --> 00:22:39,049
All doctors are like that.
They think they know everything.

274
00:22:39,126 --> 00:22:41,253
What's God?

275
00:22:41,328 --> 00:22:43,888
Well, you know when you
want something really bad

276
00:22:43,964 --> 00:22:46,159
and you close your eyes
and you wish for it?

277
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:50,465
- God's the guy that ignores you.
- Oh. Right.

278
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:53,199
Tech Service requested
in Product Extraction.

279
00:22:53,307 --> 00:22:55,468
Yeah, I'll be right there.

280
00:22:58,946 --> 00:23:01,813
Oh, hey. Let me get that.

281
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:04,783
Where do you get that stuff, anyway?

282
00:23:04,852 --> 00:23:07,650
It's an old stash.
You know, from before.

283
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:09,814
You mean from
before the contamination?

284
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,121
Yeah. Come on, you're killing me
with questions here.

285
00:23:13,193 --> 00:23:15,024
You got a sweet deal here, you know?

286
00:23:15,095 --> 00:23:18,462
Because you're,
you know, like, special.

287
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:20,329
Why? Why am I special?

288
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,027
There's another question.

289
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,001
You remember what we talked about?

290
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:27,632
You don't tell anybody
about our conversations?

291
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:30,972
- 'Cause that can get me in big trouble.
- No, I don't.

292
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:32,545
Good.

293
00:24:10,017 --> 00:24:11,814
How's it going?

294
00:24:14,321 --> 00:24:17,484
Hey, how are you?
How's your world?

295
00:24:18,191 --> 00:24:20,318
OK, I'll catch you later.

296
00:24:24,364 --> 00:24:26,389
Chinese junk locked up again, huh?

297
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:27,865
Yep.

298
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:29,869
What a surprise.

299
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:33,705
Go hot.

300
00:24:38,011 --> 00:24:40,980
- You better fix that thing.
- Yeah.

301
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:44,015
You'd think with the money
this place rakes in

302
00:24:44,084 --> 00:24:46,552
- they could afford decent equipment.
- Yeah.

303
00:24:47,955 --> 00:24:49,217
Ready?

304
00:24:51,258 --> 00:24:52,782
Cut the O2.

305
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:58,797
Seriously, unless you want to see me
blow chunks, can you wait till I'm gone?

306
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:00,958
- Sever the umbilical.
- Cutting.

307
00:25:23,824 --> 00:25:25,587
Breathe.

308
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:29,185
Come on, yeah. That's it.

309
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:35,160
Come on, breathe. Breathe.

310
00:25:35,235 --> 00:25:36,463
Come on.

311
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:40,435
Come on, come on!
Breathe, breathe!

312
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,906
There we go.
Now we're working.

313
00:25:42,976 --> 00:25:44,807
He's healthy.

314
00:25:46,813 --> 00:25:48,508
Welcome to the world.

315
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,312
So, how's Three Helo?

316
00:25:54,388 --> 00:25:55,855
Good.

317
00:25:57,991 --> 00:25:59,822
He's feisty. Light.

318
00:26:01,628 --> 00:26:04,392
Vitals seem fine.

319
00:26:05,265 --> 00:26:08,200
- Smooth extraction?
- Yep.

320
00:26:10,637 --> 00:26:13,333
Looks like we have a fine product.

321
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,670
Tag him and ship him to Foundation.

322
00:27:32,853 --> 00:27:34,582
Little bug.

323
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:24,964
Maybe next time I won't embarrass you
in front of your friends.

324
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:34,571
It was very sad.

325
00:28:35,182 --> 00:28:36,444
- Hey.
- Hello.

326
00:28:36,516 --> 00:28:38,313
Hi.

327
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:42,688
So you just let
a little girl beat you, huh?

328
00:28:44,324 --> 00:28:46,053
Stim units restricted.

329
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:48,151
Yeah, yeah.
I'll have the veggie stuff.

330
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:51,061
Papassian petal juice, please.

331
00:28:51,131 --> 00:28:52,826
It's good for the skin.

332
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:06,578
Jordan, are you sick?

333
00:29:08,048 --> 00:29:12,508
When I was in Dr. Merrick's office,
I thought I saw your name on a file.

334
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:14,281
No, I'm fine.

335
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:16,613
OK.

336
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:19,157
How are you?

337
00:29:19,226 --> 00:29:21,319
I'm fine.

338
00:29:21,394 --> 00:29:23,294
Lincoln, I can tell when you're lying

339
00:29:23,363 --> 00:29:26,628
'cause your mouth smiles
but your eyes don't.

340
00:29:29,135 --> 00:29:30,193
I found something.

341
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,532
- What?
- A bug.

342
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:33,867
- A bug?
- A flying bug.

343
00:29:33,974 --> 00:29:34,941
Can I see it?

344
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:37,168
I think it came
in the ventilation shaft.

345
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:39,973
I thought they went extinct
with the contamination.

346
00:29:40,046 --> 00:29:42,606
I know. And how did it get by
the pathogen sensors?

347
00:29:42,682 --> 00:29:45,276
- It must be too small.
- No, it's not too small.

348
00:29:45,352 --> 00:29:48,617
How did it survive out there, anyway?
How does anyone survive?

349
00:29:48,688 --> 00:29:51,555
They keep finding people,
but where do they come from?

350
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:54,753
It's good that they find survivors.

351
00:29:54,828 --> 00:29:58,662
Why do you always question the good?
You only think about the bad.

352
00:29:58,732 --> 00:30:01,360
I just have a feeling
that something is wrong.

353
00:30:02,335 --> 00:30:04,701
Good things do happen.

354
00:30:04,771 --> 00:30:07,035
I want to see that bug.

355
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:11,533
Hey. Gandu learned a new word
from the censor.

356
00:30:11,645 --> 00:30:13,772
- What?
- "Dude."

357
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,279
"Dude"?

358
00:30:15,348 --> 00:30:17,612
- What does it mean?
- He just called me dude.

359
00:30:17,684 --> 00:30:19,777
- Hey, dude.
- He said "Hey, dude"?

360
00:30:19,853 --> 00:30:21,753
- D-O-O-D. "Dude."
- Hey, dude.

361
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:23,550
- Dude.
- Dude.

362
00:30:23,623 --> 00:30:26,183
- Lottery's gonna start.
- Like you stand a chance.

363
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:27,248
Dude.

364
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:31,092
Light up all etherscreens.

365
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:34,429
And... start the lottery.

366
00:30:42,242 --> 00:30:43,470
Good evening.

367
00:30:43,576 --> 00:30:47,740
Live from Ether-Oon,
welcome to the lottery spin.

368
00:30:48,748 --> 00:30:50,682
It's been a busy week.

369
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:53,810
We've had a record two winners so far.

370
00:30:53,887 --> 00:30:57,152
Tonight's winner will be selected
at random for relocation

371
00:30:57,223 --> 00:31:01,557
to the Island, transported
to the world's last paradise.

372
00:31:01,628 --> 00:31:04,927
- And start the spin.
- And now, let the spin begin.

373
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:13,401
Jordan Two Delta, step up.

374
00:31:13,506 --> 00:31:18,409
Your time has come.
You're moving out to the Island.

375
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:27,842
For everyone else, never lose hope.

376
00:31:30,523 --> 00:31:32,423
Thank you. Thank you.

377
00:31:32,492 --> 00:31:35,256
I can't believe it.

378
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:45,503
I have to go in the morning.

379
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:47,563
You were right.

380
00:31:49,142 --> 00:31:51,770
Good things do happen.

381
00:31:55,715 --> 00:31:58,548
I wish I'd known you better.

382
00:31:59,786 --> 00:32:01,447
You two.

383
00:32:01,521 --> 00:32:02,954
Watch your proximity.

384
00:32:11,698 --> 00:32:13,962
I'll see you on the Island.

385
00:32:31,918 --> 00:32:35,410
You want to go to the Island.

386
00:32:40,427 --> 00:32:41,758
Breathe!

387
00:32:43,229 --> 00:32:44,787
You've been chosen.

388
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,994
The Island awaits you.

389
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:12,174
Check into the nurses' station
up the corridor, take your first left.

390
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,148
Dr. Lemon, call 915.

391
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:18,452
Dr. Lemon, call 915.

392
00:35:21,321 --> 00:35:23,551
She's so beautiful.

393
00:35:24,924 --> 00:35:26,949
I've never seen a baby.

394
00:35:27,026 --> 00:35:28,391
Can I hold her?

395
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:29,985
Notjust yet.

396
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:38,837
Are we going to the Island?

397
00:36:56,516 --> 00:36:58,507
Oh, my God.

398
00:36:59,085 --> 00:37:01,487
Congratulations, it's a beautiful girl.

399
00:37:01,487 --> 00:37:03,352
- Oh, my gosh.
- Thank you.

400
00:37:03,423 --> 00:37:05,391
It's my baby. Oh, my gosh.

401
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:06,720
Whenever you're ready,

402
00:37:06,793 --> 00:37:10,524
we have copies of your
policy termination for your records.

403
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:13,326
Look at her. She's beautiful.

404
00:37:15,668 --> 00:37:19,468
Starkweather? That big, cute football
player on the Reebok commercials?

405
00:37:19,539 --> 00:37:22,303
I love him! ls he in there?
I thought that was him, girl!

406
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:24,035
I just love him!

407
00:37:24,744 --> 00:37:27,235
That's great.
Listen, you're a real hoot.

408
00:37:27,346 --> 00:37:29,280
Any chance I can make this pickup?

409
00:37:29,348 --> 00:37:31,646
Well, he's still in surgery. Sorry.

410
00:37:31,718 --> 00:37:36,018
Lady, I've got a bird on the pad
and a storm's coming in.

411
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:39,388
We don't fly in bad weather.

412
00:37:42,962 --> 00:37:45,658
They look real busy.
So I'd have a seat.

413
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:49,190
Grim Reaper coming in here
with an attitude.

414
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:54,399
Heart rate 102.
BP 126 over 82.

415
00:37:54,507 --> 00:37:56,498
- Laser cutter ready?
- It's ready.

416
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:59,578
- Make sure suction's functioning.
- Ventilating easily.

417
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:01,579
- Very good.
- Grid in place.

418
00:38:01,647 --> 00:38:02,841
Prepare that bone saw.

419
00:38:04,851 --> 00:38:07,445
I think we're about ready to open.

420
00:38:25,938 --> 00:38:27,200
Let's clean that drip.

421
00:38:31,944 --> 00:38:33,878
Doctor, heart rate's rising.

422
00:38:35,782 --> 00:38:40,185
Heart rate's still rising, doctor.

423
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:46,524
- What's his blood pressure?
- BP 138 over 92.

424
00:38:48,895 --> 00:38:50,863
Heart rate's still rising.

425
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:54,127
- Boost the anesthetic level!
- He's fighting the ventilator.

426
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,725
I don't wanna euthanize this guy
to get his liver!

427
00:39:05,278 --> 00:39:06,438
Guards!

428
00:39:07,947 --> 00:39:09,847
Oh, my God!

429
00:39:17,089 --> 00:39:19,956
Stop that man! Get him!

430
00:39:26,499 --> 00:39:28,558
Stop!

431
00:39:45,151 --> 00:39:47,244
All right, relax, relax, big guy.
Relax.

432
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,413
Easy, easy, easy!
Don't damage him!

433
00:39:52,992 --> 00:39:54,516
- Relax!
- No!

434
00:39:54,594 --> 00:39:57,119
I don't want to die, no! No!

435
00:39:57,196 --> 00:40:01,064
I want to go to the Island!
You promised!

436
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:04,569
I wanna live!
I don't wanna die!

437
00:40:04,637 --> 00:40:06,229
No!

438
00:40:08,541 --> 00:40:10,008
Hey.

439
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:14,337
You OK, buddy? It's not the first time
this has happened, you know.

440
00:40:14,447 --> 00:40:17,541
Ether-Oon. Product is secure.

441
00:40:28,895 --> 00:40:30,624
Check this part out.

442
00:40:30,696 --> 00:40:32,721
Wait, OK, watch.
Wait, wait.

443
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:36,529
Boom! Did you see that? Man.

444
00:40:36,602 --> 00:40:39,162
That is so cruel, man.

445
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:42,669
Oh, man. Down for the count.

446
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:47,109
Gentlemen, I understand
there's been an incident.

447
00:40:47,179 --> 00:40:50,171
Sir, Starkweather ran
from the operating theater.

448
00:40:50,283 --> 00:40:52,843
- And do you find that funny?
- No, sir.

449
00:40:52,919 --> 00:40:56,013
- Do you?
- Definitely not, sir.

450
00:40:56,088 --> 00:40:58,283
Play it back, please.

451
00:41:03,296 --> 00:41:05,161
Stop.

452
00:41:05,231 --> 00:41:06,926
- Who is that?
- That's just an RN.

453
00:41:06,999 --> 00:41:09,297
He was scared, I helped him up.

454
00:41:10,269 --> 00:41:11,759
Play it back at half-speed.

455
00:41:18,577 --> 00:41:20,238
Freeze.

456
00:41:21,447 --> 00:41:22,812
Magnify his wrist.

457
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,585
We have a product on the loose.

458
00:41:30,823 --> 00:41:33,257
- Get me a facial match.
- We're on it.

459
00:41:33,326 --> 00:41:35,851
- Let's go.
- OK, down to Level 2.

460
00:41:48,574 --> 00:41:50,838
You can't come in here!

461
00:41:56,148 --> 00:41:59,140
- Wait.
- Oh, my God.

462
00:42:16,602 --> 00:42:18,593
- How sweet.
- You gotta come with me.

463
00:42:18,671 --> 00:42:19,660
What?

464
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:21,934
Move! Move!

465
00:42:30,483 --> 00:42:33,452
We got a match!
Lincoln Six Echo.

466
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:35,885
I want a full contamination lockdown.

467
00:42:35,955 --> 00:42:37,354
Find Six Echo.

468
00:42:39,892 --> 00:42:41,792
- Masks down.
- What the hell?!

469
00:42:41,861 --> 00:42:45,058
- I need to see all your faces.
- I don't care what he says, nurse,

470
00:42:45,131 --> 00:42:48,032
that's live human tissue.
Seal that liver now.

471
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,795
Check the back corners!

472
00:42:53,973 --> 00:42:58,273
How did that agnate get upstairs
into the Medical Sector?

473
00:42:58,878 --> 00:43:00,470
Find out.

474
00:43:02,915 --> 00:43:05,543
- Men aren't supposed to be...
- You gotta trust me.

475
00:43:05,618 --> 00:43:06,607
- What?
- I saw them.

476
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:08,983
- Who?
- Lima and Starkweather. They're dead.

477
00:43:09,055 --> 00:43:11,615
- What?
- They killed her and cut him open...

478
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:13,658
Stop it!
I want to go back to my room.

479
00:43:13,726 --> 00:43:16,627
- They're gonna kill you.
- I'm going to the Island.

480
00:43:16,695 --> 00:43:18,856
Jordan, there is no Island!
Come on!

481
00:43:20,399 --> 00:43:23,129
I got Six Echo in Female Tower,
floor 32.

482
00:43:23,202 --> 00:43:25,932
- He's got a female product in tow.
- Track that.

483
00:43:26,005 --> 00:43:28,439
Get out of the way!

484
00:43:28,541 --> 00:43:30,304
Move! Move!

485
00:43:30,409 --> 00:43:32,502
Cut of the way!
Get out. Now.

486
00:43:33,245 --> 00:43:34,439
Just trust me.

487
00:43:38,717 --> 00:43:41,185
This is a community bulletin.

488
00:43:41,253 --> 00:43:42,982
Attention, residents,

489
00:43:43,055 --> 00:43:47,151
a contamination alert
has been issued for Lincoln Six Echo.

490
00:43:47,226 --> 00:43:51,663
Anyone coming in contact with him
will be quarantined.

491
00:43:53,766 --> 00:43:56,291
Move! Move!

492
00:44:00,206 --> 00:44:01,867
Freeze! Stop right there!

493
00:44:22,728 --> 00:44:24,059
Go! Go! Go!

494
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:25,222
Get out of the way!

495
00:44:34,306 --> 00:44:38,037
I've got two agnates on the move
on the second floor.

496
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:53,849
There they are!

497
00:44:53,926 --> 00:44:58,488
I've got them in Sector Six basement!
Get them!

498
00:45:09,442 --> 00:45:11,342
- No!
- Stop!

499
00:45:21,988 --> 00:45:23,751
- Lincoln!
- Get up!

500
00:45:23,823 --> 00:45:24,847
No!

501
00:45:25,725 --> 00:45:27,352
Stop it!

502
00:45:29,128 --> 00:45:30,459
No!

503
00:46:08,201 --> 00:46:12,968
You've been chosen.
You have a very special purpose.

504
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:16,668
You're part of a new beginning.
You're special.

505
00:46:16,776 --> 00:46:19,870
You have a very special purpose.

506
00:46:24,383 --> 00:46:27,352
You want to go to the Island.
Your purpose in life

507
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,389
is to populate the Island.
You're part of a new beginning.

508
00:46:30,456 --> 00:46:34,256
You're special. Very special.
You've been chosen.

509
00:46:34,327 --> 00:46:37,319
You've been chosen.
Chosen to survive, to carry on.

510
00:46:37,396 --> 00:46:40,832
You want to go to the Island.

511
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:48,336
- Go, go!
- You have a very special purpose.

512
00:46:52,111 --> 00:46:54,341
Very special.

513
00:46:55,481 --> 00:46:57,449
- He's gotta be in here.
- I'm looking!

514
00:46:57,516 --> 00:46:59,507
Check over here!

515
00:46:59,585 --> 00:47:00,950
Watch your left!

516
00:47:02,388 --> 00:47:03,582
Run!

517
00:47:06,525 --> 00:47:08,857
Go! Run!

518
00:47:08,928 --> 00:47:10,418
He's over here!

519
00:47:17,336 --> 00:47:19,497
There they are! Go!

520
00:47:33,319 --> 00:47:36,379
- Lincoln!
- Come on! Get him!

521
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:40,150
- Let s go. Move!
- Come on!

522
00:47:42,561 --> 00:47:43,755
Come on! Come on!

523
00:47:43,829 --> 00:47:46,457
Damn! Go, go! Go!

524
00:47:46,532 --> 00:47:48,193
Come on, let's go!

525
00:47:51,671 --> 00:47:53,866
You still think there's an Island?

526
00:48:04,817 --> 00:48:06,182
Come on!

527
00:48:31,711 --> 00:48:34,111
Come on. Come on!

528
00:48:51,364 --> 00:48:53,889
There's a door over here!

529
00:50:09,508 --> 00:50:14,377
Lincoln Six Echo remains in quarantine
after contamination exposure.

530
00:50:14,447 --> 00:50:19,783
Jordan Two Delta was safely transported
to her new home on the Island.

531
00:50:19,852 --> 00:50:22,821
Jones Three Echo, I need you
to concentrate in this lab.

532
00:50:22,888 --> 00:50:26,585
Sir, I want to focus more than anything.
I love my job. It's interesting.

533
00:50:26,659 --> 00:50:29,787
But Lincoln Six Echo
has been contaminated,

534
00:50:29,862 --> 00:50:32,922
and it really worries me,
because he's a good friend of mine.

535
00:50:32,998 --> 00:50:35,466
He's one of my best friends.
My only best friend.

536
00:50:35,534 --> 00:50:37,661
He'll be fine, Three Echo.

537
00:50:37,736 --> 00:50:39,931
Sir, I have one question.

538
00:50:40,005 --> 00:50:42,132
Where do all the tubes go?

539
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:46,510
The human organism.

540
00:50:46,579 --> 00:50:49,548
Unique in all the universe
in its complexity.

541
00:50:49,615 --> 00:50:52,550
The product of three billion years
of evolution.

542
00:50:52,618 --> 00:50:56,076
Perfect in every way, except one.

543
00:50:56,155 --> 00:50:58,646
Like all machines, it wears out.

544
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:03,089
For centuries, the idea
of replenishing the human body

545
00:51:03,162 --> 00:51:05,289
has been
at the forefront of science.

546
00:51:05,364 --> 00:51:07,525
We need to turn this bad day
into a good day.

547
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,431
- How?
- A terrific day. By selling.

548
00:51:09,502 --> 00:51:12,528
By selling. Sell, sell, sell.
You start, I finish.

549
00:51:22,815 --> 00:51:24,680
Ladies and gentlemen,

550
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:28,686
welcome to
the next generation of science,

551
00:51:28,754 --> 00:51:30,722
the agnate.

552
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:34,919
An organic frame engineered
directly into adulthood

553
00:51:34,994 --> 00:51:36,791
to match the client's age.

554
00:51:36,862 --> 00:51:39,387
- You're looking at stage one
- This way, sir.

555
00:51:39,465 --> 00:51:40,864
in its development.

556
00:51:40,933 --> 00:51:43,595
Within 12 months
it will be harvest-ready,

557
00:51:43,669 --> 00:51:47,332
providing a carrier for your baby,
a second pair of lungs, fresh skin.

558
00:51:47,406 --> 00:51:51,570
All genetically indistinguishable
from your own.

559
00:51:51,677 --> 00:51:56,444
And, in compliance with
the eugenics laws of 2015,

560
00:51:56,515 --> 00:52:01,680
all our agnates are maintained
in a persistent vegetative state.

561
00:52:01,754 --> 00:52:04,154
They never achieve consciousness.

562
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:07,454
They never think or suffer

563
00:52:07,526 --> 00:52:11,553
or feel pain, joy, love, hate.

564
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:14,463
It's a product, ladies and gentlemen,

565
00:52:14,533 --> 00:52:17,297
in every way that matters,

566
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:20,167
not human.

567
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:27,504
This is our public relations director,
Mr. Whitman.

568
00:52:27,613 --> 00:52:29,706
He'll be happy
to answer any questions.

569
00:52:29,815 --> 00:52:32,283
Once again, thank you.
Mr. Whitman.

570
00:52:32,384 --> 00:52:36,411
I want to talk about the smartest
investment you'll ever make.

571
00:52:37,022 --> 00:52:41,083
And I want to tell you how you're
gonna live 60 to 70 years longer.

572
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:48,463
Dr. Merrick, Albert Laurent,
Blackhawk Security.

573
00:52:48,534 --> 00:52:52,265
You come highly recommended
by the Defense Department, Mr. Laurent.

574
00:52:52,338 --> 00:52:55,171
Though I'm unaware
of your personal qualifications.

575
00:52:55,241 --> 00:52:58,074
My men are ex-Delta Force. SEALs.

576
00:52:58,177 --> 00:53:00,941
I was formerly with the GlGN,
French Special Forces.

577
00:53:01,046 --> 00:53:03,310
I understand you had a corporate theft.

578
00:53:03,382 --> 00:53:05,816
Yes, that's what I told
the Defense Department.

579
00:53:05,884 --> 00:53:09,843
The reality is a little more complex.
That's why I require your services.

580
00:53:09,922 --> 00:53:13,050
We've had a... security breach.

581
00:53:13,125 --> 00:53:16,822
You have the Defense Department
at your disposal. Why call me?

582
00:53:16,895 --> 00:53:19,489
Because their
investment here is sizeable.

583
00:53:19,565 --> 00:53:22,864
One hundred and twenty
billion dollars, to be exact.

584
00:53:22,935 --> 00:53:25,870
And I can't afford
for them to reconsider.

585
00:53:25,938 --> 00:53:28,202
What you tell them
is your business, doctor.

586
00:53:28,274 --> 00:53:31,209
I am in the business
of keeping my clients' confidence.

587
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:32,777
Good.

588
00:53:37,249 --> 00:53:39,581
Two of our products have escaped.

589
00:53:39,652 --> 00:53:42,644
lmpressive,
considering they're vegetative.

590
00:53:42,721 --> 00:53:45,588
Well, after several years
of trial and error,

591
00:53:45,658 --> 00:53:48,024
we discovered that
without consciousness,

592
00:53:48,093 --> 00:53:53,531
without human experience,
emotion, without life,

593
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:55,897
the organs failed.

594
00:53:57,536 --> 00:53:59,595
How long have they been missing?

595
00:53:59,672 --> 00:54:02,436
Four hours and 36 minutes.

596
00:54:02,508 --> 00:54:05,272
- They're on foot?
- Yes.

597
00:54:05,377 --> 00:54:09,245
Wade, 1 .2 miles an hour,
five mile perimeter,

598
00:54:09,315 --> 00:54:12,409
- standby for suspect description.
- We're on it.

599
00:54:12,518 --> 00:54:13,951
Follow me.

600
00:54:30,836 --> 00:54:34,363
- Come on, we gotta keep going.
- I have to stop. I can't run anymore.

601
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,737
- You gotta try.
- Where?

602
00:54:35,808 --> 00:54:38,333
- Anywhere but here.
- But there's nothing.

603
00:54:38,444 --> 00:54:41,208
Everything's dead, Lincoln.

604
00:54:46,852 --> 00:54:49,252
What if we are contaminated?

605
00:54:49,822 --> 00:54:51,915
Then we'd be dead.

606
00:54:52,691 --> 00:54:55,387
There's no contamination.
It was a lie.

607
00:55:06,672 --> 00:55:09,539
- What is it?
- I don't know.

608
00:55:09,608 --> 00:55:11,269
But it's alive.

609
00:55:15,914 --> 00:55:18,906
Come on. It's mean, whatever it is.

610
00:55:19,017 --> 00:55:20,279
Let's rest in here.

611
00:55:20,352 --> 00:55:23,116
Jordan Two Delta's sponsor,
Sarah Jordan, is in a coma

612
00:55:23,188 --> 00:55:26,351
after a car accident.
She's in need of multiple transplants.

613
00:55:26,425 --> 00:55:28,154
How long does she have?

614
00:55:28,227 --> 00:55:30,695
Forty-eight hours.
Three days maximum.

615
00:55:30,763 --> 00:55:32,492
Tell me about Six Echo.

616
00:55:32,564 --> 00:55:35,965
He was really the first one
to question his environment,

617
00:55:36,034 --> 00:55:37,558
his whole existence here.

618
00:55:37,636 --> 00:55:41,834
Over the last few months,
he began demonstrating unstable behavior

619
00:55:41,907 --> 00:55:44,740
and I can't account for it.

620
00:55:44,843 --> 00:55:47,311
I'm waiting on the result
of his synaptic scan.

621
00:55:47,413 --> 00:55:49,813
What do they know
about the outside world?

622
00:55:49,882 --> 00:55:51,816
Very little.

623
00:55:51,884 --> 00:55:54,978
We control them with
the memory of a shared event.

624
00:55:55,053 --> 00:55:59,422
A global contamination.
It keeps them fearful of going outside.

625
00:55:59,491 --> 00:56:04,053
The Island is the one thing
that gives them hope,

626
00:56:04,129 --> 00:56:06,154
gives them purpose.

627
00:56:06,698 --> 00:56:08,962
Everything we expose them to,

628
00:56:09,034 --> 00:56:12,663
their programs, their cartoons,
books, the games they play,

629
00:56:12,738 --> 00:56:16,367
are designed to manage aggression
and reinforce simple social skills.

630
00:56:16,442 --> 00:56:18,933
To avoid obvious complications,

631
00:56:19,044 --> 00:56:21,672
they aren't imprinted
with an awareness of sex.

632
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:25,113
We find it simpler
to eliminate the drive altogether.

633
00:56:25,617 --> 00:56:30,953
In a very real sense...
they're like children.

634
00:56:31,023 --> 00:56:33,719
Educated to the level of a 15-year-old.

635
00:56:50,909 --> 00:56:54,276
- What was that?
- I don't know.

636
00:56:55,647 --> 00:56:57,376
But I want one.

637
00:57:11,997 --> 00:57:13,726
Look!

638
00:57:14,566 --> 00:57:17,865
Route 39. Route 39.

639
00:57:17,936 --> 00:57:19,927
Come on.

640
00:57:20,005 --> 00:57:22,166
I got it from a friend.

641
00:57:46,999 --> 00:57:49,024
I think that's it.

642
00:58:20,632 --> 00:58:21,758
What's up?

643
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:24,495
Yeah, do you know
a guy named McCord?

644
00:58:26,138 --> 00:58:28,333
Yeah, we know that tool.
Who's asking?

645
00:58:29,207 --> 00:58:33,007
- I am.
- And you would be who?

646
00:58:33,111 --> 00:58:36,171
- Lincoln Six Echo.
- Jordan Two Delta.

647
00:58:37,482 --> 00:58:39,313
Right.

648
00:58:39,384 --> 00:58:42,251
Y'all some of those desert UFO freaks?

649
00:58:42,321 --> 00:58:45,415
- U... What? No, I don't think so.
- No.

650
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:46,684
McCord?

651
00:58:46,758 --> 00:58:49,192
Well, lucky day, Captain Kirk.
He's in the can.

652
00:58:49,261 --> 00:58:51,661
- He's in a can?
- Taking a dump.

653
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:53,527
A dump? Taking it where?

654
00:58:56,168 --> 00:58:58,500
Bubba, you're fixing
to get on my nerves.

655
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:01,801
- It's the first door on the right.
- Thank you.

656
00:59:01,873 --> 00:59:04,933
I have to go.
He's taking a dump in a can.

657
00:59:05,043 --> 00:59:08,035
- Something to drink? Jack?
- Yes, please.

658
00:59:08,146 --> 00:59:10,137
Straight up?

659
00:59:21,126 --> 00:59:23,458
Oh, that is bitchin'.

660
00:59:25,731 --> 00:59:27,528
So this is Sector Five?

661
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:29,897
Hey! You son of a bitch!

662
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:33,399
You knew!

663
00:59:33,472 --> 00:59:36,703
- How the hell did you get out?
- Why do they lie to us? Tell me!

664
00:59:36,775 --> 00:59:38,606
They're gonna be looking for you.

665
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:41,907
- Tell me what's going on!
- If  anybody sees us together,

666
00:59:42,014 --> 00:59:44,107
both of us are gonna be dead.

667
00:59:44,216 --> 00:59:47,083
So, will you just
take your hands off me? Let me...

668
00:59:47,152 --> 00:59:51,452
Let me pull my pants up
and I'll take you back to my place

669
00:59:51,523 --> 00:59:53,320
so we can be alone. OK?

670
00:59:56,361 --> 00:59:59,797
- Ed.
- Mac.

671
01:00:00,699 --> 01:00:03,099
Give you... give you boys a minute?

672
01:00:04,569 --> 01:00:07,094
What?
This isn't what it looks like.

673
01:00:09,274 --> 01:00:11,469
Sure. Sure.

674
01:00:11,576 --> 01:00:13,476
Get out of here, you stupid...

675
01:00:13,545 --> 01:00:15,706
Will you stop?

676
01:00:17,149 --> 01:00:20,585
You can'tjust bust in on a guy
like that. That's really rude.

677
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,280
She doesn't understand the licking.

678
01:00:24,356 --> 01:00:26,756
You a knucklehead?
You brought another one?

679
01:00:26,825 --> 01:00:28,884
- Excuse me.
- Hey. Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

680
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,394
Back off, Joe, OK?
Don't push me!

681
01:00:31,463 --> 01:00:32,987
No, no, no, that's no good.

682
01:00:33,065 --> 01:00:34,589
Put it on my tab.
We gotta go.

683
01:00:34,666 --> 01:00:37,191
Friends from out of town.
Come on, sweetheart.

684
01:00:37,269 --> 01:00:39,100
- Give me your number.
- Two Delta.

685
01:00:39,171 --> 01:00:41,867
Hey, look. Get...
Don't test me.

686
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:43,908
Don't.

687
01:00:55,721 --> 01:00:58,451
Well, this is nice.

688
01:01:01,293 --> 01:01:04,194
Mac doesn't talk much
about his work at the Institute.

689
01:01:04,262 --> 01:01:06,662
Do y'all work with him?

690
01:01:07,799 --> 01:01:10,825
Saving lives and all
must be real rewarding.

691
01:01:10,902 --> 01:01:13,302
Those are fancy tracksuits.

692
01:01:13,371 --> 01:01:17,102
Y'all exercise out in this heat,
gonna get yourself nasty heatstroke.

693
01:01:18,076 --> 01:01:21,705
Oh, Mac, look.
They got matching bracelets.

694
01:01:21,813 --> 01:01:25,749
- We should do that, honey.
- Suzie...

695
01:01:25,817 --> 01:01:28,945
Do you remember the talk
we had about all the talk?

696
01:01:30,255 --> 01:01:31,415
Yeah.

697
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:34,857
Actually, would you run down to Red's
and pick us up a sixer of Bud?

698
01:01:34,926 --> 01:01:38,259
- We've got to talk shop.
- OK, baby.

699
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:40,662
- Just making friends.
- I know. Good. Just...

700
01:01:40,732 --> 01:01:41,994
Bye.

701
01:01:48,373 --> 01:01:49,772
Why do they lie, Mac?

702
01:01:49,841 --> 01:01:52,503
Why do they lie to us? Tell me.

703
01:01:56,047 --> 01:01:58,174
To keep you
from knowing what you are.

704
01:01:58,984 --> 01:02:02,613
- What we are?
- What are we?

705
01:02:02,687 --> 01:02:06,714
Man, why do I gotta be the guy
tells the kids there's no Santa Claus?

706
01:02:10,962 --> 01:02:13,226
OK, look. You're...

707
01:02:15,667 --> 01:02:17,897
Well, you're not like me.

708
01:02:19,704 --> 01:02:22,901
I mean, you're not... human.

709
01:02:24,342 --> 01:02:28,506
I mean, you're human,
but you just, you're not real.

710
01:02:28,613 --> 01:02:32,481
You're not,
like, a real person. Like me.

711
01:02:35,654 --> 01:02:37,986
You're clones.

712
01:02:40,025 --> 01:02:43,859
You're copies of people
out here in the world.

713
01:02:43,929 --> 01:02:45,556
- What?
- Clones?

714
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:47,825
- What? Why?
- What are you talking about?

715
01:02:47,899 --> 01:02:51,266
Some hag trophy wife
needs new skin for a facelift

716
01:02:51,336 --> 01:02:53,497
or one of 'em gets sick
and need a new part,

717
01:02:53,572 --> 01:02:55,904
they take it from you.

718
01:02:57,576 --> 01:03:00,807
But I have a mother.
I remember her.

719
01:03:00,912 --> 01:03:02,971
- Yeah, I know.
- I grew up on a farm.

720
01:03:03,081 --> 01:03:05,106
I have a little dog and I had a bike.

721
01:03:05,217 --> 01:03:06,741
And a bike. Right.

722
01:03:06,852 --> 01:03:10,253
It was a pink Flexi-Flyer
with little tassels on the handlebars

723
01:03:10,322 --> 01:03:12,517
and you rode it
to your grandmother's.

724
01:03:12,591 --> 01:03:15,856
You ring the little bell and she
came out and served you cookies.

725
01:03:15,927 --> 01:03:17,258
Yeah.

726
01:03:17,329 --> 01:03:21,527
No. Memory imprints.
I seen them.

727
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,797
A buddy of mine is a programmer
at the Institute. He showed me.

728
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:28,465
There's only 12 stories.
They change around little details,

729
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:30,770
but they're all pretty much the same.

730
01:03:30,842 --> 01:03:36,280
The life you think you had
before the "contamination,"

731
01:03:36,348 --> 01:03:38,782
it never happened.

732
01:03:40,051 --> 01:03:43,680
Come on, don't look at me like that.
At least you had a bike.

733
01:03:43,755 --> 01:03:47,919
Wanna trade your rosy memory implants
for my shitty childhood, be my guest.

734
01:03:47,993 --> 01:03:49,551
How long?

735
01:03:50,629 --> 01:03:52,290
How long have we been alive?

736
01:03:53,465 --> 01:03:56,400
You're Echo generation,
so you're three.

737
01:03:58,069 --> 01:03:59,593
Delta means you're four.

738
01:04:02,107 --> 01:04:03,335
Three?

739
01:04:03,408 --> 01:04:07,367
The whole reason you exist is
'cause everyone wants to live forever.

740
01:04:07,479 --> 01:04:09,310
It's the new American dream.

741
01:04:09,381 --> 01:04:12,873
There's people out there that are
rich enough to pay anything for it.

742
01:04:12,984 --> 01:04:16,476
Don't people care that they kill us?
That they take parts from us?

743
01:04:16,554 --> 01:04:20,820
They don't know. They think you're
vegetables simmering in a jelly sack.

744
01:04:20,892 --> 01:04:25,420
Why do you think Merrick has you stuck
in an old military bunker below ground?

745
01:04:25,497 --> 01:04:29,228
He doesn't want anybody knowing
the truth, especially not sponsors.

746
01:04:29,301 --> 01:04:33,169
- Sponsors?
- The people that had you made.

747
01:04:33,238 --> 01:04:35,399
They, like, own you.

748
01:04:37,475 --> 01:04:43,380
But why doesn't Merrick want
our owners to know that we're alive?

749
01:04:43,448 --> 01:04:48,181
Just because people wanna eat the burger
doesn't mean they wanna meet the cow.

750
01:04:49,087 --> 01:04:52,784
Besides, do you know
how many laws Merrick's breaking

751
01:04:52,857 --> 01:04:55,087
to have you two hatched?

752
01:04:56,895 --> 01:04:59,159
Your sponsors
can't have any part of that.

753
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:01,630
They're like high society,
rich and famous.

754
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:04,225
If  they knew,
Merrick would be out of business.

755
01:05:04,302 --> 01:05:06,930
We have to find our sponsors
and tell them the truth.

756
01:05:07,005 --> 01:05:08,370
- What?
- Yeah.

757
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,533
No, that's the worst idea I ever heard.

758
01:05:10,608 --> 01:05:13,099
You know how dead I'd be?
Not to mention fired?

759
01:05:13,211 --> 01:05:15,543
We will. We will.
That's our only chance.

760
01:05:15,613 --> 01:05:18,582
Stop, stop! Fold, stop.
Brakes. No. Come on.

761
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:21,380
You're the replacement engines
on their Bentley.

762
01:05:21,453 --> 01:05:24,752
They're not gonna care.
What? They're gonna care?

763
01:05:24,823 --> 01:05:26,154
You know what I would do?

764
01:05:26,224 --> 01:05:29,591
I would just get as far away
from here as I could.

765
01:05:29,661 --> 01:05:30,889
Go to the beach.

766
01:05:30,962 --> 01:05:34,125
We're not asking
for your permission, Mac.

767
01:05:34,199 --> 01:05:36,133
We're asking for your help.

768
01:05:37,702 --> 01:05:39,533
Oh, God.

769
01:05:47,879 --> 01:05:52,339
Infrared's having a hard time picking up
a heat signature. Sand's too hot.

770
01:05:56,554 --> 01:05:59,182
He was implanted
with micro-sensors yesterday.

771
01:05:59,257 --> 01:06:03,125
Can we configure our instrument
to pick up a low-frequency RF scan?

772
01:06:03,194 --> 01:06:06,493
- If  we can get within half a mile.
- Do it.

773
01:06:06,564 --> 01:06:09,362
Your sponsors names
are Tom Lincoln and Sarah Jordan.

774
01:06:09,434 --> 01:06:11,095
Her sponsor lives in New York.

775
01:06:11,169 --> 01:06:14,195
The number in your name
is a regional code.

776
01:06:14,272 --> 01:06:18,572
Six Echo, that means
your sponsor lives in LA.

777
01:06:18,676 --> 01:06:20,803
- You're going out of state.
- Out of state?

778
01:06:20,912 --> 01:06:22,402
Put this on.

779
01:06:22,514 --> 01:06:25,506
You're gonna go in here.
All right? Come on, come on.

780
01:06:25,617 --> 01:06:28,347
Keep going. What size?

781
01:06:29,287 --> 01:06:30,720
All right.

782
01:06:30,789 --> 01:06:32,950
These are bags, OK?
You put stuff in 'em.

783
01:06:33,024 --> 01:06:35,788
Backpacks for boys, purses for girls.
Understand?

784
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:37,350
We're not idiots.

785
01:06:37,429 --> 01:06:40,887
Excuse me, Miss
"I'm so smart l can't wait to go to the Island."

786
01:06:44,502 --> 01:06:46,527
Yeah. Good.

787
01:06:51,843 --> 01:06:53,105
Wait. Hold, hold, hold.

788
01:06:53,211 --> 01:06:55,679
People don't really
wear these on the outside.

789
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:58,340
These are mail-order, OK?
These stay here.

790
01:07:01,252 --> 01:07:05,188
No. Mail-order, OK?
Clones don't wear these.

791
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,257
All right, listen up.

792
01:07:10,328 --> 01:07:13,388
This card is like stim credits, OK?

793
01:07:13,465 --> 01:07:16,434
It'll get you food, but I gotta
report it stolen in 24 hours

794
01:07:16,501 --> 01:07:20,597
or else they'll know I helped you.
After that, use the cash.

795
01:07:23,675 --> 01:07:24,767
All right, look.

796
01:07:24,876 --> 01:07:27,868
I know you're new to this
whole human experience and all,

797
01:07:27,979 --> 01:07:29,674
but there's one universal truth

798
01:07:29,781 --> 01:07:32,545
and that is you never
give a woman your credit card.

799
01:07:33,318 --> 01:07:35,309
Right.

800
01:07:41,292 --> 01:07:42,987
I got something. It's hot.

801
01:07:53,638 --> 01:07:56,198
Oh, God.

802
01:07:58,009 --> 01:08:01,069
- Train four...
- Train'll be here. Hustle.

803
01:08:01,146 --> 01:08:04,707
...to Sacramento
is now boarding at platform A.

804
01:08:04,782 --> 01:08:08,582
All right, stay. All right?
Just stay. Don't move

805
01:08:09,721 --> 01:08:11,188
Mama!

806
01:08:14,993 --> 01:08:16,961
Look at that!

807
01:08:17,028 --> 01:08:19,292
Those are kids.

808
01:08:21,099 --> 01:08:22,623
Wow.

809
01:08:28,339 --> 01:08:31,797
Come here. The train is non-stop to LA.
You need these to get on.

810
01:08:31,876 --> 01:08:35,539
When you get there, look up your
sponsors in the information directory.

811
01:08:35,613 --> 01:08:37,080
- You got it?
- Yeah. Yeah.

812
01:08:37,148 --> 01:08:40,948
- What is an information directory?
- It'll tell you where they live.

813
01:08:41,052 --> 01:08:44,021
And whatever you do,
do not trust anyone.

814
01:08:44,088 --> 01:08:48,184
One thing I can tell you about people,
is that they'll do anything to survive.

815
01:08:48,259 --> 01:08:50,227
Thank you, Mac. Thank you.

816
01:08:51,129 --> 01:08:53,029
Thanks a lot.

817
01:08:53,097 --> 01:08:56,658
All right. I'm just gonna go upstairs
and get you guys a map of LA.

818
01:08:56,734 --> 01:08:59,100
Better not get me in trouble.

819
01:09:10,281 --> 01:09:13,273
Yeah, no problem.
Sure, that's a good one.

820
01:09:20,792 --> 01:09:23,124
I think I got an ID.
Two in the center.

821
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:32,028
Run!

822
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,592
Run!

823
01:11:11,438 --> 01:11:12,598
God!

824
01:11:15,275 --> 01:11:20,338
Amtrak train 227 now departing
for Los Angeles at platform O.

825
01:11:25,585 --> 01:11:28,554
What's wrong with these people?
They killed him.

826
01:11:42,902 --> 01:11:45,871
- This was supposed to be a simple job?
- It's never simple.

827
01:11:45,939 --> 01:11:47,600
We got a missing credit card.

828
01:11:47,674 --> 01:11:52,111
McCord just used it to buy train tickets
and it's not in his wallet.

829
01:11:52,178 --> 01:11:56,410
Monitor the account. Have Amtrak
patch you through to the conductor.

830
01:11:57,550 --> 01:11:59,415
Get me a new team in LA.

831
01:12:02,222 --> 01:12:05,157
- Got here as fast as I could.
- Come here.

832
01:12:05,225 --> 01:12:08,422
I finished scanning the Defense
Department Troop Selections,

833
01:12:08,495 --> 01:12:11,123
- if you want to see them...
- Not yet. Look at that.

834
01:12:12,899 --> 01:12:15,959
- Six Echo drew it.
- It's elaborate.

835
01:12:16,036 --> 01:12:20,268
"Renovachio." Renovatee-oh?

836
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:22,865
Renovatio.
What is that, ltalian?

837
01:12:22,942 --> 01:12:24,933
It's Latin.

838
01:12:25,378 --> 01:12:27,573
We've never imprinted
an agnate with Latin.

839
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:29,945
Yes, I'm well aware of that.

840
01:12:30,817 --> 01:12:33,183
So where did he learn it?

841
01:12:33,286 --> 01:12:35,277
Where are the results from his scan?

842
01:12:35,388 --> 01:12:39,256
- They'll be back from Johns Hopkins...
- Just speed it up.

843
01:12:39,326 --> 01:12:40,384
Yes, sir.

844
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:54,429
You two.

845
01:12:54,507 --> 01:12:56,941
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention please,

846
01:12:57,010 --> 01:13:00,104
train number 1 7
leaving for San Diego...

847
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:02,740
- There!
- ...was delayed 20 minutes. Stand by.

848
01:14:51,391 --> 01:14:55,020
We just arrived, but Troy's already
tapped into the city cameras.

849
01:15:02,101 --> 01:15:05,696
Excuse me.
Where's an information directory?

850
01:15:05,772 --> 01:15:07,296
Thanks.

851
01:15:12,912 --> 01:15:15,881
Wilshire. 5th. Grand.

852
01:15:15,949 --> 01:15:20,886
Spring. Grand Avenue?
Smile for the camera, sweetheart.

853
01:15:29,162 --> 01:15:32,495
Where is Flower?
You on Flower?

854
01:15:33,099 --> 01:15:35,966
Olive, Olive.
Come on, come on.

855
01:15:36,035 --> 01:15:38,094
You look familiar.

856
01:15:38,671 --> 01:15:39,831
Gotcha.

857
01:15:42,275 --> 01:15:44,743
Three Black Wasps
and two jet bikes.

858
01:15:44,811 --> 01:15:47,302
We just got a facial hit
on our fugitives!

859
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:49,575
Let's go! Let's go! Move!

860
01:15:53,152 --> 01:15:55,177
We're moving! Let's go.

861
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:08,925
Wait. Got a hit
on McCord's credit card.

862
01:16:09,002 --> 01:16:11,562
Location, Grand Avenue at 9830.

863
01:16:11,638 --> 01:16:14,402
Team, proceed immediately to 9830.

864
01:16:14,474 --> 01:16:18,535
No, no, no. LAPD's moving in.
They've flagged McCord's credit card.

865
01:16:18,611 --> 01:16:21,774
- Tom Lincoln.
- One moment, please.

866
01:16:23,082 --> 01:16:26,449
- Not listed.
- Sarah Jordan.

867
01:16:33,293 --> 01:16:34,419
Hello?

868
01:16:34,494 --> 01:16:37,554
Yes, I'm looking for Sarah Jordan.

869
01:16:38,197 --> 01:16:40,597
She's sick.

870
01:16:40,667 --> 01:16:44,797
- Can I talk to her?
- She's at the hospital.

871
01:16:44,871 --> 01:16:47,271
Mommy, is that you?

872
01:17:03,122 --> 01:17:05,454
Jordan. Let's go!

873
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:09,794
Freeze! Put your hands up!

874
01:17:09,862 --> 01:17:12,262
- Keep your hands off!
- Put your hands up!

875
01:17:12,332 --> 01:17:14,323
Do as I say! Do as I say!

876
01:17:15,635 --> 01:17:17,933
- Lincoln.
- Just do what they say.

877
01:17:18,004 --> 01:17:19,471
Lincoln.

878
01:17:19,539 --> 01:17:20,733
- Pull back.
- Move out.

879
01:17:20,807 --> 01:17:22,468
What's going on?

880
01:17:31,317 --> 01:17:33,581
Nail it! Quick, move!

881
01:17:44,197 --> 01:17:47,496
We're detaining you in connection
to the murder of James McCord.

882
01:17:47,567 --> 01:17:50,730
- What? He was my friend!
- Anything you say can and will be used

883
01:17:50,803 --> 01:17:53,499
- against you in a court of law.
- What's a court of law?

884
01:17:57,110 --> 01:18:00,375
They'll run DNA.
If  the agnates are booked,

885
01:18:00,446 --> 01:18:03,472
it'll implicate your clients
in a murder investigation.

886
01:18:03,549 --> 01:18:04,777
This is a nightmare.

887
01:18:04,884 --> 01:18:07,785
You cannot allow this to happen.
Do you understand me?

888
01:18:07,854 --> 01:18:10,254
You use any force that is necessary.

889
01:18:10,323 --> 01:18:12,883
I'm ordering you
to contain the situation.

890
01:18:12,992 --> 01:18:16,223
1-Adam-82, we've apprehended
the suspects. Two adults, no ID.

891
01:18:16,295 --> 01:18:18,957
Notify Forensics,
we'll need DNA typing.

892
01:18:19,032 --> 01:18:21,500
- My name is Tom Lincoln.
- Sit back and shut up.

893
01:18:21,567 --> 01:18:24,764
- Could you look up my file, please?
- Sit back.

894
01:18:39,652 --> 01:18:42,382
Dispatch, we're two minutes out.

895
01:18:52,131 --> 01:18:54,190
- Check inside!
- Hey, can you hear me?

896
01:18:54,267 --> 01:18:57,361
Lincoln, get up!
Get up, Lincoln! Get up!

897
01:19:04,010 --> 01:19:05,170
Let's go!

898
01:19:05,845 --> 01:19:07,608
Go! Go! Go!

899
01:19:08,414 --> 01:19:09,506
Go!

900
01:19:13,252 --> 01:19:14,879
We got cops. We got cops!

901
01:19:22,595 --> 01:19:23,926
Get down!

902
01:19:31,404 --> 01:19:33,372
Run!

903
01:19:34,073 --> 01:19:36,701
I see them! Let's get moving!

904
01:19:37,977 --> 01:19:40,707
Let's go!
Come on, come on, come on!

905
01:19:41,647 --> 01:19:43,046
Move, move!

906
01:19:43,116 --> 01:19:44,947
Move out! Move out!

907
01:19:55,795 --> 01:19:57,558
Come on!

908
01:20:06,405 --> 01:20:09,101
Go, go, go, go! Go!

909
01:20:20,153 --> 01:20:22,087
Shit! Check up here!

910
01:20:23,289 --> 01:20:24,722
Come on!

911
01:21:00,927 --> 01:21:04,055
Air-Two, give me status of the targets.

912
01:21:04,797 --> 01:21:08,028
- Targets are under the train wheels.
- Silently, take them out.

913
01:21:11,003 --> 01:21:12,061
Go!

914
01:21:14,941 --> 01:21:16,738
Move! Go, go!

915
01:21:16,809 --> 01:21:18,367
- I can't fit!
- Move back!

916
01:21:18,444 --> 01:21:19,706
I can't fit!

917
01:21:38,064 --> 01:21:39,554
Look out, look out!

918
01:21:45,838 --> 01:21:47,237
Right, right, right!

919
01:22:01,988 --> 01:22:03,012
Stay on them!

920
01:22:05,291 --> 01:22:06,758
Look out!

921
01:22:11,264 --> 01:22:13,994
Do not let him get away!
Do not let him get away!

922
01:22:36,722 --> 01:22:38,485
Good job!

923
01:22:39,926 --> 01:22:43,362
We've gotta bail out of here,
there's police choppers inbound.

924
01:22:52,038 --> 01:22:53,938
Black Wasp, take out the truck!

925
01:23:04,684 --> 01:23:06,879
Troy, you all right? Let's go!

926
01:23:11,657 --> 01:23:12,681
Cops! Cops!

927
01:23:36,515 --> 01:23:37,812
He's coming back!

928
01:23:40,486 --> 01:23:41,714
Stay down, Jordan!

929
01:24:09,949 --> 01:24:13,407
- How do you know what you're doing?
- I don't know!

930
01:25:12,278 --> 01:25:13,575
Hold on!

931
01:25:15,515 --> 01:25:16,675
Look out!

932
01:25:24,057 --> 01:25:25,285
Look out!

933
01:25:32,899 --> 01:25:35,163
Hold on!

934
01:25:53,052 --> 01:25:55,987
- Don't let me go, Lincoln!
- I got you! I got you!

935
01:25:56,055 --> 01:25:58,182
- Don't let me go!
- I got you!

936
01:25:58,925 --> 01:26:02,326
I'm slipping!
Don't drop me, Lincoln!

937
01:26:02,428 --> 01:26:05,727
- Don't drop me!
- I got you! I got you!

938
01:26:08,835 --> 01:26:11,963
Lincoln! Pull me! Pull me!

939
01:26:13,806 --> 01:26:15,899
Climb up!

940
01:26:18,911 --> 01:26:21,641
If  there's no way to get
our fugitives quietly,

941
01:26:21,714 --> 01:26:23,978
you need to take them out.

942
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:29,450
I see our targets about 70 stories up.

943
01:26:29,555 --> 01:26:31,955
They're on top of the building logo.

944
01:26:35,428 --> 01:26:37,123
Tough day.

945
01:26:37,797 --> 01:26:39,230
Let's roll.

946
01:26:40,867 --> 01:26:43,097
LAPD! Get away from the window!

947
01:26:47,473 --> 01:26:48,565
Jay, you got him?

948
01:26:50,276 --> 01:26:52,210
Right there! Right there!
Get him!

949
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:03,712
Stay there! Damn it!
Just stay down!

950
01:27:04,290 --> 01:27:05,848
Come on!

951
01:27:09,495 --> 01:27:12,157
Gonna swing around to get a shot.

952
01:27:18,237 --> 01:27:19,602
He's coming back.

953
01:27:35,721 --> 01:27:36,881
Oh, no.

954
01:27:40,626 --> 01:27:43,060
Hang on!
They're coming off the building.

955
01:28:09,489 --> 01:28:11,320
Look out!

956
01:28:26,806 --> 01:28:28,330
Jesus must love you!

957
01:28:28,407 --> 01:28:30,773
That was the craziest mess
I ever seen!

958
01:28:30,843 --> 01:28:34,506
Come on, girl.
I know Jesus loves you.

959
01:28:44,524 --> 01:28:47,186
Can you keep a secret, doc?

960
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:48,887
Why, yes, of course.

961
01:28:48,961 --> 01:28:51,225
There is something
going on around here.

962
01:28:51,297 --> 01:28:53,595
Something you may
not even know about.

963
01:28:53,666 --> 01:28:54,724
What is it?

964
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:59,999
Well, I'm not sure that
the contamination is real.

965
01:29:00,072 --> 01:29:02,063
- Why do you think that?
- OK.

966
01:29:02,141 --> 01:29:07,044
Lincoln told me that he found
a flying bug in Sector Six.

967
01:29:07,113 --> 01:29:08,637
- Wow.
- Right.

968
01:29:08,714 --> 01:29:11,615
And I think that might be why
he thought he could leave.

969
01:29:11,684 --> 01:29:14,346
Have you told
anyone else about this?

970
01:29:14,453 --> 01:29:18,389
No, no. But I'm gonna do some digging.
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

971
01:29:18,491 --> 01:29:21,221
And when I do,
I'll share my information with you.

972
01:29:21,294 --> 01:29:22,955
Thank you.

973
01:29:23,029 --> 01:29:25,259
I want to be helpful.
I like it here.

974
01:29:25,331 --> 01:29:27,128
Good.

975
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:29,668
But I really want to look
into the lottery too.

976
01:29:29,735 --> 01:29:32,829
- Something's wrong there.
- Yeah.

977
01:29:32,905 --> 01:29:34,736
You know,

978
01:29:34,807 --> 01:29:37,367
you were one of the first
of the Echo generation.

979
01:29:37,443 --> 01:29:39,638
You're very smart.

980
01:29:39,712 --> 01:29:42,408
Yeah. I remember
when I first came here.

981
01:29:45,117 --> 01:29:47,813
A survivor, just like you.

982
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:50,514
One of the first, in fact.

983
01:29:50,623 --> 01:29:54,559
It's natural, even healthy,
to question the world we're presented.

984
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:58,096
You might say it's only...
only human.

985
01:30:00,566 --> 01:30:03,091
Oh, that burns!

986
01:30:04,870 --> 01:30:08,601
Get me a list of all the Echos
in active population.

987
01:30:26,292 --> 01:30:28,760
I saw his address. Tom Lincoln.

988
01:30:28,861 --> 01:30:31,762
We'll go there when the rain stops.

989
01:30:32,398 --> 01:30:35,526
- It'll be OK when we find him.
- OK.

990
01:30:41,073 --> 01:30:44,008
That little boy looked like me.

991
01:30:47,146 --> 01:30:49,512
His mom's gonna die, isn't she?

992
01:30:50,650 --> 01:30:52,345
I don't know.

993
01:30:55,221 --> 01:30:56,882
You're lying.

994
01:31:04,630 --> 01:31:06,598
It's cold.

995
01:31:56,515 --> 01:31:57,709
Go in.

996
01:31:58,451 --> 01:31:59,782
I can't.

997
01:32:00,619 --> 01:32:04,111
- I'll go in.
- Jordan. Jordan!

998
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,557
Hello?

999
01:32:12,331 --> 01:32:14,162
Hello?

1000
01:33:01,914 --> 01:33:03,575
Lincoln!

1001
01:33:20,699 --> 01:33:22,963
Oh, my God.

1002
01:33:25,237 --> 01:33:28,001
My name is Lincoln Six Echo.

1003
01:33:28,073 --> 01:33:30,837
I'm your insurance policy.

1004
01:33:45,791 --> 01:33:48,521
And what are you doing in my house?

1005
01:33:53,566 --> 01:33:55,295
Sir, sir.

1006
01:33:56,068 --> 01:34:00,061
You need to see this.
It's a... It's...

1007
01:34:00,806 --> 01:34:02,000
It's beautiful.

1008
01:34:02,074 --> 01:34:04,907
This is a synaptic scan
we took of Six Echo three years ago,

1009
01:34:04,977 --> 01:34:07,969
before we integrated him
into the agnate population. OK?

1010
01:34:08,047 --> 01:34:11,983
This is his scan from a few days ago.
You can see how much the memory's grown.

1011
01:34:12,051 --> 01:34:15,509
Like he's experienced 30 years,
not three, which is impossible.

1012
01:34:15,621 --> 01:34:19,614
Or maybe this is scarring from
a cortical infection that we didn't...

1013
01:34:19,725 --> 01:34:23,889
An infection can't teach you Latin,
or how to fly.

1014
01:34:30,669 --> 01:34:32,967
They are memories.

1015
01:34:34,707 --> 01:34:36,902
But they're not his.

1016
01:34:38,511 --> 01:34:41,241
They belong to his sponsor.

1017
01:34:41,313 --> 01:34:43,281
I've seen you before.

1018
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:46,841
I've seen you in Maxim, Esquire...

1019
01:34:46,952 --> 01:34:50,718
- Maxim?
- Oh, they're men's magazines.

1020
01:34:50,789 --> 01:34:55,852
Pictures of women
with little, tight, short...

1021
01:34:55,928 --> 01:34:59,796
...stories too.
Anyway, you're very popular.

1022
01:35:02,635 --> 01:35:04,500
There we are.

1023
01:35:05,804 --> 01:35:07,271
What is that?

1024
01:35:07,339 --> 01:35:09,534
That looks like some kind of thermal...

1025
01:35:12,411 --> 01:35:15,380
Boy, your skin is so soft.

1026
01:35:15,447 --> 01:35:17,574
Did you know?

1027
01:35:22,288 --> 01:35:25,280
I put some clothes
out for you upstairs.

1028
01:35:25,391 --> 01:35:28,554
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

1029
01:35:38,470 --> 01:35:40,734
I keep expecting to wake up.

1030
01:35:40,806 --> 01:35:43,172
I thought I was taller.

1031
01:35:43,609 --> 01:35:46,976
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
Come here.

1032
01:35:48,047 --> 01:35:50,880
She is unbelievable.

1033
01:35:50,950 --> 01:35:54,579
How is it you've been around three
years and end up with the kind of woman

1034
01:35:54,687 --> 01:35:57,417
I haven't been able to find
my whole life? Give me that.

1035
01:35:57,523 --> 01:36:01,084
She found me.
She's my best friend.

1036
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:04,561
- Why do we sound different?
- I'm from Scotland.

1037
01:36:04,630 --> 01:36:06,723
I'm from Scotland.

1038
01:36:06,799 --> 01:36:09,768
Hey, look. You're creeping me out
enough without that.

1039
01:36:09,835 --> 01:36:13,100
- Without that.
- No, really, cut it out.

1040
01:36:13,172 --> 01:36:15,163
That's enough.

1041
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:17,936
Yeah, that is enough.
I'm sorry.

1042
01:36:18,577 --> 01:36:20,568
Like a freak show.

1043
01:36:20,646 --> 01:36:22,705
Yeah, it's weird.

1044
01:36:25,184 --> 01:36:30,247
- So, you build boats?
- I design them. I draw them, yeah.

1045
01:36:31,123 --> 01:36:32,590
Here.

1046
01:36:32,658 --> 01:36:37,425
I started off with cars, motorcycles.
Experimental designs.

1047
01:36:37,496 --> 01:36:40,829
Anything that blew my hair back.
Kind of a speed freak, you know?

1048
01:36:40,899 --> 01:36:43,367
- Petrol-head.
- Motorcycles, wow.

1049
01:36:43,435 --> 01:36:47,371
- I feel like I've seen these before.
- It's something I've always done.

1050
01:36:47,439 --> 01:36:49,771
I never dreamt it would make me rich.

1051
01:36:49,842 --> 01:36:51,434
What's Renovatio?

1052
01:36:51,510 --> 01:36:54,308
"Renovatio" in Latin means rebirth.

1053
01:36:54,380 --> 01:36:56,211
Subtle, eh?

1054
01:36:56,715 --> 01:37:00,708
Look. I have cirrhotic hepatitis.

1055
01:37:00,819 --> 01:37:03,720
A parting gift from God
for all my philandering.

1056
01:37:04,223 --> 01:37:05,884
What?

1057
01:37:05,991 --> 01:37:08,789
Lots and lots of sex.

1058
01:37:09,895 --> 01:37:12,864
- Sex?
- Sex with...

1059
01:37:13,832 --> 01:37:15,857
You've... You're a virgin?

1060
01:37:17,403 --> 01:37:21,134
You're kicking around with her
and you're a virgin?

1061
01:37:22,675 --> 01:37:27,374
OK, I'm not gonna spoil the surprise,
but, boy, are you in for a treat.

1062
01:37:27,446 --> 01:37:31,507
Look, my doctor said that my liver will
start failing within the next two years.

1063
01:37:36,021 --> 01:37:39,582
I'm not good at all this shite,
you know? Confessions and regret.

1064
01:37:43,362 --> 01:37:44,886
Look.

1065
01:37:44,963 --> 01:37:47,295
There are people who are following us.

1066
01:37:47,366 --> 01:37:50,824
They're trying to kill us.
The reason we came is we need your help.

1067
01:37:50,903 --> 01:37:52,063
Help you do what?

1068
01:37:52,137 --> 01:37:54,367
To show people
what the Institute does.

1069
01:37:55,007 --> 01:37:57,942
But who'd believe it?
I'm looking at you and I don't.

1070
01:37:58,577 --> 01:38:02,445
Who is that guy? I know him.
Is  he the Community Announcer?

1071
01:38:02,514 --> 01:38:04,141
He's the President of America.

1072
01:38:04,216 --> 01:38:06,980
- He has a clone.
- He's an absolute idiot.

1073
01:38:07,086 --> 01:38:08,849
Yeah, I never liked him, either.

1074
01:38:08,954 --> 01:38:11,718
- Do a lot of people see this?
- The news? A lot.

1075
01:38:11,790 --> 01:38:14,088
Then if we can get
on there together,

1076
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:16,150
people will see us and know the truth.

1077
01:38:16,261 --> 01:38:18,855
So the idea is that we both
just waltz down to NBO

1078
01:38:18,931 --> 01:38:21,399
and see if they can slot us in
after the weather.

1079
01:38:21,467 --> 01:38:25,665
This might not mean anything to you,
but there are thousands of us.

1080
01:38:25,738 --> 01:38:28,571
Everyone we've ever known
is gonna die in that place.

1081
01:38:35,881 --> 01:38:37,746
Help us.

1082
01:38:40,486 --> 01:38:43,614
All right.
Let me just get my shoes, OK?

1083
01:39:02,441 --> 01:39:04,966
Tom, hurry up!

1084
01:39:08,747 --> 01:39:10,612
Merrick Institute.

1085
01:39:11,850 --> 01:39:14,842
- Merrick Biotech. How may I help you?
- This is Tom Lincoln.

1086
01:39:14,953 --> 01:39:17,353
- Hi, Mr. Lincoln.
- I was wondering if you could

1087
01:39:17,422 --> 01:39:20,016
get someone who can explain
why my insurance policy

1088
01:39:20,125 --> 01:39:22,286
is sitting downstairs
on my fucking sofa.

1089
01:39:22,861 --> 01:39:25,489
- Can you hold, please?
- Sure.

1090
01:39:36,675 --> 01:39:40,839
I'm sorry to keep you both waiting.
I was getting myself organized.

1091
01:39:40,913 --> 01:39:43,211
OK, shall we go?
Are you ready?

1092
01:39:51,924 --> 01:39:53,858
- Something's wrong.
- What?

1093
01:39:56,094 --> 01:39:59,996
His eyes are lying.
The same as yours do.

1094
01:40:00,065 --> 01:40:01,396
You stay here.

1095
01:40:01,466 --> 01:40:03,491
- No, don't...
- Shall we?

1096
01:40:04,002 --> 01:40:06,527
- Yeah.
- Is  everything OK?

1097
01:40:06,605 --> 01:40:09,699
Yeah. She's gonna stay here
in case they don't believe us.

1098
01:40:09,775 --> 01:40:12,005
No, come on, we'll all go.
It'll be good.

1099
01:40:12,077 --> 01:40:13,203
No, she's gonna stay.

1100
01:40:19,551 --> 01:40:22,179
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1101
01:40:23,789 --> 01:40:25,120
That's...

1102
01:40:34,666 --> 01:40:37,499
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.

1103
01:40:37,569 --> 01:40:40,402
- I'll drive.
- Oh, no. I'll drive.

1104
01:40:40,472 --> 01:40:42,565
No, really.

1105
01:40:42,641 --> 01:40:44,666
Do you know how?

1106
01:40:44,743 --> 01:40:48,406
- Yeah, I taught myself.
- But you don't know the way.

1107
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:50,880
Well, then you can show me.

1108
01:40:53,719 --> 01:40:57,280
Well, be careful.
This is a V-12-09 Caddy.

1109
01:40:57,389 --> 01:41:01,792
Seven hundred and fifty horsepower,
$500,000 car.

1110
01:41:04,663 --> 01:41:06,290
Put your thumb on that.

1111
01:41:08,834 --> 01:41:11,564
You were worth every penny.
We've the same prints.

1112
01:41:11,637 --> 01:41:13,832
- What are you doing?
- Getting directions.

1113
01:41:13,906 --> 01:41:16,670
Hello, Mr. Lincoln.
Where would you like to go?

1114
01:41:16,742 --> 01:41:18,642
KNBO news studio.

1115
01:41:18,710 --> 01:41:22,646
- One moment, please.
- Thanks for doing this.

1116
01:41:22,714 --> 01:41:26,912
That's all right. I'd like to think
you'd do the same thing if you were me.

1117
01:41:30,422 --> 01:41:33,880
- How much did I cost?
- Five million dollars.

1118
01:41:33,992 --> 01:41:35,289
Is  that a lot?

1119
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:38,295
It's a small price to pay
to cheat death.

1120
01:41:53,912 --> 01:41:56,244
That's a red.
It's a red. Red. Red!

1121
01:41:56,315 --> 01:41:58,146
- Stop the car!
- Why? What? Why?

1122
01:41:58,216 --> 01:42:00,684
It's a red light! Stop the car!

1123
01:42:03,455 --> 01:42:04,581
What's the matter?

1124
01:42:04,690 --> 01:42:08,126
You wanker! It's a red light! Stop!
It means stop!

1125
01:42:08,226 --> 01:42:10,626
- I didn't know that.
- You said you could drive.

1126
01:42:10,696 --> 01:42:14,393
Well, I do know how to drive.
I just don't know what the lights mean.

1127
01:42:21,073 --> 01:42:23,200
I'm sorry. I'm not ready to die.

1128
01:42:26,778 --> 01:42:28,575
Me neither!

1129
01:42:33,151 --> 01:42:34,277
Go, go, go, go!

1130
01:42:36,488 --> 01:42:38,080
- What are you doing? Stop!
- No.

1131
01:42:38,156 --> 01:42:40,386
- Stop the car now!
- No!

1132
01:42:49,301 --> 01:42:50,598
- I'll shoot! Stop!
- No!

1133
01:42:50,669 --> 01:42:52,864
- Yes!
- No!

1134
01:43:03,081 --> 01:43:05,515
There's cars coming at us
in all directions!

1135
01:43:25,837 --> 01:43:27,236
They're shooting my car!

1136
01:43:28,473 --> 01:43:31,499
They've shot the engine!
They've shot my engine!

1137
01:43:32,210 --> 01:43:34,269
Oh, God, my nose!

1138
01:43:57,736 --> 01:44:00,500
Come here! Where'd you think
you were going, eh?

1139
01:44:06,378 --> 01:44:07,709
- Come on!
- Let go of me!

1140
01:44:07,779 --> 01:44:09,110
Get up!

1141
01:44:10,382 --> 01:44:12,407
- Get off me!
- Come on, get up!

1142
01:44:12,484 --> 01:44:14,748
- Let me go!
- Get up!

1143
01:44:14,820 --> 01:44:18,312
No, no, no,don't shoot him.
I need him. I need him.

1144
01:44:24,529 --> 01:44:27,464
No, don't shoot!
He's my clone!

1145
01:44:32,070 --> 01:44:34,504
- I'm Tom Lincoln!
- What?

1146
01:44:34,573 --> 01:44:37,440
No, I'm Tom Lincoln! He's lying.

1147
01:44:37,509 --> 01:44:41,104
Shut up! I own you!

1148
01:44:41,746 --> 01:44:44,476
He's the... I'm Tom Lincoln!

1149
01:44:44,549 --> 01:44:47,211
Don't point the gun at me,
you frickin' idiot!

1150
01:44:47,285 --> 01:44:50,812
- He's the clone. Look at him!
- I'm not a clone! I'm Tom!

1151
01:44:50,889 --> 01:44:54,154
No, I'm Tom! He's lying!
Point it at him!

1152
01:44:54,259 --> 01:44:55,988
- No. I'm not.
- Shut up!

1153
01:44:56,094 --> 01:44:59,154
Shut up, you're a clone! Shut up!

1154
01:44:59,264 --> 01:45:01,255
I'm Tom Lincoln!

1155
01:45:01,333 --> 01:45:03,324
- I'm Tom Lincoln!
- Don't, don't...

1156
01:45:09,608 --> 01:45:10,870
Oh, shit.

1157
01:45:38,370 --> 01:45:40,304
Close.

1158
01:45:47,479 --> 01:45:51,609
Do you think it's strange that my
insurance policy just tried to kill me?

1159
01:45:51,683 --> 01:45:54,846
I found this whole operation strange.

1160
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:56,888
Where's the woman?

1161
01:45:56,955 --> 01:46:00,288
She said she was going out of state...

1162
01:46:00,392 --> 01:46:01,859
...to look for her sponsor.

1163
01:46:02,827 --> 01:46:06,991
You've been witness
to certain trade secrets.

1164
01:46:07,065 --> 01:46:12,059
You mean that they manufacture
human beings who walk, talk and feel?

1165
01:46:12,137 --> 01:46:14,537
That kind of secret?

1166
01:46:15,173 --> 01:46:18,006
Have you talked
with anyone else about this?

1167
01:46:18,076 --> 01:46:19,907
Who would believe it?

1168
01:46:19,978 --> 01:46:22,003
Can I count on that?

1169
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,344
The only thing you can count on

1170
01:46:24,416 --> 01:46:28,147
is that people will
do anything to survive.

1171
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:33,658
I just want to live.
I don't care how.

1172
01:46:37,495 --> 01:46:39,759
Thank you.

1173
01:46:39,831 --> 01:46:43,130
Thank you very much.
Job well done.

1174
01:46:49,574 --> 01:46:52,702
Jordan? Jordan?

1175
01:46:52,777 --> 01:46:55,109
Stop.

1176
01:46:57,048 --> 01:47:00,506
Hey, Jordan, it's me. It's me.

1177
01:47:18,903 --> 01:47:20,962
It's you.

1178
01:47:47,265 --> 01:47:51,395
- Wow, that tongue thing is amazing.
- I know. Open your mouth again.

1179
01:47:53,471 --> 01:47:56,440
- How come we never did this before?
- Shut up.

1180
01:48:19,864 --> 01:48:22,560
The Island is real.

1181
01:48:23,435 --> 01:48:25,198
It's us.

1182
01:48:28,273 --> 01:48:31,174
- How many are affected?
- About half.

1183
01:48:31,242 --> 01:48:34,336
We're seeing the same
neural patterns in all of the Echos,

1184
01:48:34,412 --> 01:48:38,371
plus every subsequent generation:
the Foxtrots, Gammas and Helos.

1185
01:48:38,450 --> 01:48:42,113
We predicated
our entire system on predictability.

1186
01:48:42,187 --> 01:48:46,590
Six Echo has displayed
the one trait that undermines it:

1187
01:48:46,691 --> 01:48:49,159
Human curiosity.

1188
01:48:50,395 --> 01:48:55,662
So... we're now
facing four generations

1189
01:48:55,734 --> 01:48:58,999
with the potential
for defiant behavior.

1190
01:49:00,171 --> 01:49:02,332
What are you suggesting?

1191
01:49:02,407 --> 01:49:04,534
A recall.

1192
01:49:05,043 --> 01:49:09,537
Wait, you mean dispose of over
200 million dollars' worth of product?

1193
01:49:09,614 --> 01:49:12,242
- Yes.
- Great.

1194
01:49:12,317 --> 01:49:16,219
Cisco IP Communicator.
Connecting to Merrick Biotech.

1195
01:49:17,222 --> 01:49:22,319
This is Charlie Whitman, the public
relations director at Merrick Biotech.

1196
01:49:22,427 --> 01:49:25,692
My deepest apologies for yesterday's

1197
01:49:25,764 --> 01:49:29,200
unfortunate inconvenience you had.

1198
01:49:29,267 --> 01:49:33,670
Your defect in your policy wasn't,
by no means, an isolated incident,

1199
01:49:33,738 --> 01:49:36,673
and it is totally correctable,
I assure you.

1200
01:49:36,741 --> 01:49:40,268
We are calling other
valued clients right now

1201
01:49:40,345 --> 01:49:43,781
to inform them of a recall,
so, please, call us when you get in...

1202
01:49:44,983 --> 01:49:47,281
Unfortunate inconvenience?

1203
01:49:47,352 --> 01:49:49,513
That's a bit of an understatement.

1204
01:49:49,587 --> 01:49:52,647
Mr. Lincoln, you're home.
Aren't you traumatized, sir?

1205
01:49:52,757 --> 01:49:56,193
I mean, I had a home invasion once
where they put the gun to my head.

1206
01:49:56,294 --> 01:49:58,785
I never forgot that.
I shook for two days.

1207
01:49:58,897 --> 01:50:01,297
What kind of recall
are you talking about?

1208
01:50:01,366 --> 01:50:05,530
Oh, it's a small defect that we found
in four of our product lines.

1209
01:50:05,603 --> 01:50:08,504
What are you gonna do
with the defective products?

1210
01:50:10,575 --> 01:50:11,872
Starting over.

1211
01:50:13,845 --> 01:50:16,871
- Starting over?
- Absolutely nothing to worry about.

1212
01:50:16,948 --> 01:50:19,178
We guarantee
our product 100 percent.

1213
01:50:19,250 --> 01:50:22,549
The unfortunate inconvenience for you

1214
01:50:22,620 --> 01:50:27,114
is we're gonna have to re-scan you
so that we can re-grow your policy.

1215
01:50:27,225 --> 01:50:31,628
Does today work for you at all?
Pick you up by helicopter at 3:00?

1216
01:50:31,696 --> 01:50:33,960
I'll call you back.

1217
01:50:41,639 --> 01:50:43,266
Dr. Merrick,

1218
01:50:43,341 --> 01:50:46,640
how do we remove the
defective products from the population

1219
01:50:46,711 --> 01:50:49,441
without disrupting the others?

1220
01:50:49,514 --> 01:50:51,880
We already have the mechanism in place.

1221
01:50:53,084 --> 01:50:56,281
Dahlgren Two Foxtrot.

1222
01:50:57,021 --> 01:50:59,512
Cooper Five Gamma.

1223
01:51:00,358 --> 01:51:02,588
Mass winnings.

1224
01:51:05,497 --> 01:51:09,228
He kept a journal
and a lot of maps.

1225
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:11,928
After I figure out how
to get that thing in the water,

1226
01:51:12,003 --> 01:51:14,528
then we can get on it and...

1227
01:51:14,606 --> 01:51:16,437
...we'll keep heading south.

1228
01:51:16,508 --> 01:51:18,738
We could live like real people.

1229
01:51:18,810 --> 01:51:21,608
Tulie Two Foxtrot.

1230
01:51:21,679 --> 01:51:24,580
Ginsberg Two Helo.

1231
01:51:27,619 --> 01:51:29,416
We'll disappear.

1232
01:51:29,988 --> 01:51:31,353
Yeah.

1233
01:51:32,624 --> 01:51:35,024
But after.

1234
01:51:44,102 --> 01:51:46,627
All those people we left behind.

1235
01:51:46,704 --> 01:51:49,537
Jones Three Echo.

1236
01:52:06,624 --> 01:52:09,252
When we were escaping,

1237
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:10,827
I saw this room.

1238
01:52:11,696 --> 01:52:14,529
If  I could get in
and shut it down,

1239
01:52:14,599 --> 01:52:16,897
they'd see the truth.

1240
01:52:25,310 --> 01:52:29,940
Gentlemen, there is, however, another
matter that requires board approval.

1241
01:52:33,384 --> 01:52:36,717
The disposal of 200 million dollars
of infected product.

1242
01:52:43,728 --> 01:52:45,355
All in favor?

1243
01:52:45,463 --> 01:52:46,430
- Aye.
- Aye.

1244
01:52:46,531 --> 01:52:48,021
Aye.

1245
01:53:01,879 --> 01:53:03,278
You've been chosen.

1246
01:53:04,215 --> 01:53:05,614
You're special.

1247
01:53:08,186 --> 01:53:09,983
Very special.

1248
01:53:15,860 --> 01:53:18,226
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1249
01:53:18,296 --> 01:53:19,388
Thanks.

1250
01:53:24,469 --> 01:53:25,458
Here you go.

1251
01:53:25,536 --> 01:53:29,233
- And what do you say to the nice lady?
- Thank you!

1252
01:54:36,674 --> 01:54:38,733
In-bound, Jordan product.

1253
01:54:53,725 --> 01:54:57,525
- Escort her to Surgery Prep Seven.
- I better say hello.

1254
01:55:05,937 --> 01:55:07,905
Mr. Lincoln, thank you for coming.

1255
01:55:07,972 --> 01:55:10,702
It's great seeing you again,
and we are so, so sorry

1256
01:55:10,775 --> 01:55:12,834
about this entire episode.

1257
01:55:12,910 --> 01:55:15,504
I want to tell you that
we are going to be birthing

1258
01:55:15,580 --> 01:55:17,810
a brand new agnate for you
free of charge.

1259
01:55:17,882 --> 01:55:21,181
Won't cost you a penny. After you.

1260
01:55:21,252 --> 01:55:24,085
Would you like an apple?
An afternoon snack...?

1261
01:55:24,155 --> 01:55:27,249
- No. How long will this take?
- It's gonna take about an hour.

1262
01:55:27,358 --> 01:55:29,952
I read that you're from Scotland.
I prefer lreland.

1263
01:55:30,061 --> 01:55:31,653
But what part in Scotland...?

1264
01:55:31,763 --> 01:55:34,732
I realize that this small talk
is just part of yourjob,

1265
01:55:34,832 --> 01:55:38,131
- but let's cut the shite, OK?
- Point taken. My apologies.

1266
01:55:38,202 --> 01:55:40,602
I'm just a bit of a jabberjaw.
Chatty Cathy.

1267
01:55:40,671 --> 01:55:43,003
Turn right. This way.

1268
01:55:49,847 --> 01:55:51,747
I'll take her.

1269
01:56:03,427 --> 01:56:06,055
This is gonna be the exact
same routine as last time.

1270
01:56:06,164 --> 01:56:08,826
Mind the hose.
Technician will be here.

1271
01:56:08,900 --> 01:56:13,303
Look at you, so young and successful.
I always wanted to get into yachting.

1272
01:56:24,949 --> 01:56:27,110
I hear they're taking your kidneys,

1273
01:56:27,919 --> 01:56:32,049
your lungs, your heart.

1274
01:56:32,123 --> 01:56:35,286
They are gonna hack you up.

1275
01:56:40,965 --> 01:56:42,694
Too bad.

1276
01:56:57,515 --> 01:56:59,380
No one is touching me.

1277
01:57:01,452 --> 01:57:03,682
- Give me your Tri-Key.
- You shot me.

1278
01:57:03,754 --> 01:57:06,587
Shut up! Give me your walkie!

1279
01:57:09,794 --> 01:57:11,762
Get down. Get down, now!

1280
01:57:55,439 --> 01:57:57,907
- You all right?
- Yes.

1281
01:57:59,176 --> 01:58:00,803
Come on.

1282
01:58:02,346 --> 01:58:04,041
I've got this figured out.

1283
01:58:04,115 --> 01:58:05,605
I kind of...

1284
01:58:05,683 --> 01:58:09,744
I messed it up in one area right down
in there, but the hole doesn't matter.

1285
01:58:09,820 --> 01:58:13,017
Something's happening.
Something's happening.

1286
01:58:13,591 --> 01:58:15,058
Hello, sir. Hello.

1287
01:58:15,159 --> 01:58:16,922
Thank you for your patience.

1288
01:58:17,028 --> 01:58:19,428
I'm sure you're excited
to get to the Island.

1289
01:58:19,497 --> 01:58:22,830
If  you grab your belongings
and line up in a single-file line

1290
01:58:22,900 --> 01:58:25,027
and follow me,
we'll be on our way.

1291
01:58:26,470 --> 01:58:31,066
Take this. Go.
You have to keep going.

1292
01:58:31,142 --> 01:58:33,110
- Go. Go.
- OK.

1293
01:58:33,177 --> 01:58:35,077
Go shut it down.

1294
01:58:48,392 --> 01:58:50,724
I love that Picasso.

1295
01:58:51,595 --> 01:58:54,359
Do you like Picasso, Mr. Laurent?

1296
01:58:55,466 --> 01:58:59,835
You delivered on your promise.
Well done. I'm very pleased. Thank you.

1297
01:58:59,904 --> 01:59:02,236
What about the client?
Sarah Jordan?

1298
01:59:02,306 --> 01:59:03,398
She's doubtful.

1299
01:59:03,474 --> 01:59:05,408
Even if the transplant's a success,

1300
01:59:05,476 --> 01:59:08,912
her brain damage may be too severe
for any real recovery.

1301
01:59:08,980 --> 01:59:11,244
You took too long bringing her back.

1302
01:59:11,315 --> 01:59:14,148
The girl, you're going to harvest her,
kill her anyway,

1303
01:59:14,218 --> 01:59:16,345
even though it won't
make any difference?

1304
01:59:17,121 --> 01:59:21,114
That's the privilege our clients
pay for, Mr. Laurent.

1305
01:59:21,225 --> 01:59:25,719
Now, do excuse me,
I have business to attend to.

1306
01:59:26,731 --> 01:59:30,633
You know my father was part
of the Burkinabe Rebellion?

1307
01:59:30,701 --> 01:59:34,797
And when he was killed,
me and my brothers were branded,

1308
01:59:37,074 --> 01:59:40,942
so others would know
we were less than human.

1309
01:59:41,645 --> 01:59:45,843
I've seen and done things I'm not proud
of, but at some point you realize war...

1310
01:59:47,151 --> 01:59:48,914
...is a business.

1311
01:59:53,991 --> 01:59:56,459
So when did killing
become a business for you?

1312
02:00:02,533 --> 02:00:05,832
Oh, it's so much more than that.

1313
02:00:08,305 --> 02:00:12,071
I have discovered the Holy Grail
of science, Mr. Laurent.

1314
02:00:12,143 --> 02:00:13,770
I give life.

1315
02:00:14,178 --> 02:00:17,773
The agnates,
they're simply tools, instruments.

1316
02:00:17,848 --> 02:00:20,715
They have no souls.

1317
02:00:21,118 --> 02:00:23,848
The possibilities are endless here.

1318
02:00:23,921 --> 02:00:27,880
In two years' time, I will be able
to cure children's leukemia.

1319
02:00:27,958 --> 02:00:31,359
How many people on Earth
can say that, Mr. Laurent?

1320
02:00:33,130 --> 02:00:35,030
I guess just you and God.

1321
02:00:38,803 --> 02:00:41,795
That's the answer
you're looking for, isn't it?

1322
02:00:46,877 --> 02:00:49,505
Mr. Whitman has your check downstairs.

1323
02:00:56,887 --> 02:00:59,549
Looks like single gunshot.

1324
02:01:02,059 --> 02:01:03,822
Oh, no.

1325
02:01:04,695 --> 02:01:06,094
Wrong wrist.

1326
02:01:06,163 --> 02:01:10,532
Dr. Merrick,
the body thatjust came in...

1327
02:01:10,601 --> 02:01:13,331
...is the client.

1328
02:01:25,182 --> 02:01:27,810
lssue a security alert!
Lincoln Six Echo!

1329
02:01:32,623 --> 02:01:35,592
Down, down, down!
Move, move!

1330
02:01:48,873 --> 02:01:51,774
- Disturbance in the Hologram Room.
- I'm on it.

1331
02:01:53,844 --> 02:01:57,075
Dr. Merrick, I sent censors
to check a possible attempted breach

1332
02:01:57,148 --> 02:01:59,082
in Hologram Control.

1333
02:02:40,057 --> 02:02:42,457
One after another,
step into the room.

1334
02:02:42,526 --> 02:02:45,051
If  I'm going to the Island,
why did I leave my bag?

1335
02:02:45,162 --> 02:02:46,823
Step right in, thank you.

1336
02:02:47,765 --> 02:02:51,724
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Is  this the right way? l...

1337
02:02:51,802 --> 02:02:54,532
Are you new here?
I don't know if this is the way!

1338
02:02:54,605 --> 02:02:57,073
It's going to the Island!

1339
02:02:58,742 --> 02:03:01,506
I'm almost positive that
you're going the wrong way!

1340
02:03:06,083 --> 02:03:07,778
Open the door!

1341
02:03:13,324 --> 02:03:16,316
She said open the door!

1342
02:03:51,562 --> 02:03:56,397
You could have taken over his life,
but you chose to come back.

1343
02:03:56,467 --> 02:03:59,197
You truly are unique, Six Echo.

1344
02:03:59,937 --> 02:04:02,132
My name is Lincoln!

1345
02:05:20,851 --> 02:05:22,876
I brought you into this world...

1346
02:05:29,293 --> 02:05:31,124
...and I can take you out of it.
