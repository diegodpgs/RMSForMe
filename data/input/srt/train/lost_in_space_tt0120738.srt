1
00:00:17,093 --> 00:00:18,386
Finally...

2
00:00:18,845 --> 00:00:21,973
the warring nations of Earth had
forgotten their differences...

3
00:00:22,473 --> 00:00:25,351
and banded together
to save our planet.

4
00:00:26,144 --> 00:00:29,981
The United Global Space Force
was searching the galaxy...

5
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:33,776
for worlds rich with drinkable
water and breathable air.

6
00:00:34,318 --> 00:00:37,447
The hypergate was our best hope
to colonize space...

7
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:38,865
our best hope for survival.

8
00:00:39,365 --> 00:00:41,075
But as we prepared
to launch ourselves...

9
00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:43,286
into the black of space...

10
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:47,457
terrorists, calling themselves
'The Global Sedition...'

11
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:49,750
were preparing to strike.

12
00:00:55,965 --> 00:00:58,926
Grissom base, this is Cargo 7
requesting landing clearance.

13
00:00:59,385 --> 00:01:00,928
Roger, transport.
This is Grissom gate control.

14
00:01:01,387 --> 00:01:02,138
Please download security codes.

15
00:01:02,638 --> 00:01:03,389
Downloading.

16
00:01:03,848 --> 00:01:06,350
Transport, I've got two blips
inside your radar signature.

17
00:01:06,809 --> 00:01:07,685
They're hiding in your shadow.

18
00:01:08,144 --> 00:01:09,312
I don't see anything.

19
00:01:14,483 --> 00:01:17,195
This is gate control.
Battle stations.

20
00:01:20,573 --> 00:01:21,490
Battle stations.

21
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:24,202
Two Sedition fighters
are attacking the hypergate.

22
00:01:24,702 --> 00:01:25,745
Battle stations.

23
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:27,830
Gate control, this is Eagle One.
I'm locked and loaded.

24
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:29,707
Ready to fly.

25
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:32,293
Roger, Eagle One.
You're clear to launch.

26
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,008
Jeb, where are you, buddy?

27
00:01:40,593 --> 00:01:42,929
This cold war just got hot.

28
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:44,263
They're Sedition raiders.

29
00:01:44,764 --> 00:01:47,224
It's another
mutant suicide squad.

30
00:01:48,643 --> 00:01:50,394
Here we go. Man-to-man.
Split them up.

31
00:01:50,895 --> 00:01:54,649
Last one to kill a bad guy
buys the beer.

32
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:59,820
I'm gonna go through the gate,
get in front of him.

33
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:02,698
That's not standard procedure,
Don.

34
00:02:06,243 --> 00:02:07,745
Better get inside his shields.

35
00:02:17,254 --> 00:02:18,506
You gen-techs are ugly up close.

36
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:19,882
Target lock.

37
00:02:20,383 --> 00:02:21,509
Show time.

38
00:02:29,475 --> 00:02:31,227
Bogey One dispatched.

39
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:34,980
Don, he's right on my tail.

40
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,816
Damn! Can't shake him.

41
00:02:42,446 --> 00:02:43,406
I've been hit!

42
00:02:43,906 --> 00:02:45,032
Weapons are off-line.

43
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,159
I'm gonna jettison
the main drive core.

44
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,911
There you are.

45
00:02:56,252 --> 00:02:57,795
Am I good or what?

46
00:02:58,254 --> 00:03:00,506
Warning. Failure
in redundant drive systems.

47
00:03:01,006 --> 00:03:02,758
Gate control,
this is Ranger One.

48
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:05,136
Engines will not respond.

49
00:03:06,095 --> 00:03:09,140
Don, I'm falling
towards the hypergate.

50
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:11,726
Breaking thrusters won't fire!

51
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,311
Impact in 30 seconds.

52
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,730
Ranger One, this is base.

53
00:03:16,272 --> 00:03:18,190
Rescue craft
have been dispatched.

54
00:03:20,317 --> 00:03:23,320
Grissom, those pods will never
reach him in time.

55
00:03:23,821 --> 00:03:24,572
I'm going in.

56
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,366
Major West, you are not
authorized to jeopardize--

57
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:28,993
Never liked that station anyway.

58
00:03:29,493 --> 00:03:32,705
Warning. Proximity alert.

59
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:37,543
Hang on, Jeb. I'm coming in.

60
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:40,171
Abort. Abort!

61
00:03:40,713 --> 00:03:43,257
I'll give you a little kiss.
Don't take this the wrong way.

62
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:46,010
Impact in five seconds.

63
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,030
Does this mean
we're going steady?

64
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:09,366
You're not getting out
of buying those beers that easy.

65
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,966
With intrepid pioneering spirit,
the Robinson family...

66
00:04:26,425 --> 00:04:28,844
will journey to the distant
world of Alpha Prime.

67
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:31,972
What kind of future can
our children look forward to?

68
00:04:32,431 --> 00:04:34,099
A future in paradise.

69
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,559
The Jupiter mission...

70
00:04:36,018 --> 00:04:39,146
made possible by the Army and
Silicon Graphics Corporation.

71
00:04:39,605 --> 00:04:43,609
S.G.I. Saving the future
for our children.

72
00:04:44,109 --> 00:04:45,694
Give me a break.

73
00:04:46,195 --> 00:04:47,863
Holo-call
from Houston middle school.

74
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:49,156
Hello?

75
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:50,908
Hello, Principal Cartwright.

76
00:04:51,408 --> 00:04:53,160
What has he done this time?

77
00:04:53,619 --> 00:04:58,082
He hacked our main power grid
to run his experiment.

78
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,501
The school was in chaos.

79
00:05:01,293 --> 00:05:02,253
Yeah, right.

80
00:05:02,753 --> 00:05:04,630
We didn't even have lights.

81
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:11,804
This is no laughing matter,
Professor Robinson.

82
00:05:12,262 --> 00:05:15,307
Will is terribly gifted.

83
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:18,018
The changing shape of education.

84
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,063
His little time machines,
though pure fancy...

85
00:05:21,563 --> 00:05:24,441
are the products
of a truly brilliant mind.

86
00:05:26,276 --> 00:05:27,820
No more monkey business.

87
00:05:28,278 --> 00:05:29,571
I mean it.

88
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,157
The boy is starved
for attention.

89
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,577
I know your life is anything
but normal right now...

90
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,371
but wasn't there some way...

91
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,874
his father could have
attended the science fair?

92
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,918
As you are aware...

93
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:45,879
Alpha Prime is the only other
habitable planet...

94
00:05:46,338 --> 00:05:50,134
yet detected
by deep space recon.

95
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:54,179
My crew will sleep away
our 10-yearjourney there...

96
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,390
in suspended animation.

97
00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:00,394
Once we have rendezvoused with
the research colony on Alpha...

98
00:06:00,853 --> 00:06:03,063
I will supervise
construction of a hypergate.

99
00:06:03,522 --> 00:06:06,233
By then,
technicians here on Earth...

100
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:09,695
will have completed
the companion hypergate...

101
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:12,281
in our planet's orbit.

102
00:06:13,824 --> 00:06:15,534
Once both gates are complete...

103
00:06:16,368 --> 00:06:20,789
ships will be able to pass
instantaneously between them.

104
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:24,752
Immediate colonization
of Alpha Prime will be possible.

105
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,796
Can't you just use
the Jupiter's hyper-engine...

106
00:06:28,297 --> 00:06:30,257
to zap straight to Alpha Prime?

107
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:33,343
Hyperspace exists
beneath normal space.

108
00:06:33,844 --> 00:06:37,347
If you try to enter hyperspace
without a gate...

109
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:39,600
your exit factor is random.

110
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,685
There's no telling
where you'd come out.

111
00:06:42,394 --> 00:06:45,147
Ninety-eight percent of
the galaxy is still uncharted.

112
00:06:45,647 --> 00:06:48,400
There's a lot of space
to get lost in.

113
00:06:50,652 --> 00:06:52,863
How is Captain Daniels
recovering from the flu?

114
00:06:53,322 --> 00:06:54,740
Will he pilot the mission?

115
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,783
Ladies and gentlemen.

116
00:06:57,242 --> 00:07:01,079
You came to get your first look
at the Jupiter 1.

117
00:07:01,538 --> 00:07:03,207
Don't you think
you've waited long enough?

118
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,792
Let's move into the launch dome.

119
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:07,127
One more question, Professor.

120
00:07:07,586 --> 00:07:09,838
Now that the mission's
been pushed up...

121
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:12,841
how do your children feel
about leaving the earth behind?

122
00:07:13,342 --> 00:07:16,011
They couldn't be more excited.

123
00:07:17,179 --> 00:07:18,889
This mission sucks!

124
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:21,266
I don't wanna leave early.
I don't wanna go at all.

125
00:07:21,725 --> 00:07:23,101
We will discuss this at dinner.

126
00:07:24,102 --> 00:07:27,147
For the last three years, I've
missed everything training...

127
00:07:27,606 --> 00:07:30,359
so I can spend the next 10 years
missing everything else.

128
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:33,195
I'm not staying home for dinner.

129
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:34,905
I'm seeing my friends.

130
00:07:35,364 --> 00:07:36,698
Penny.

131
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,786
I'm going out to say good-bye
to my entire life.

132
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,581
Penny, I need you here tonight.
Wait a minute.

133
00:07:51,713 --> 00:07:55,384
On this eve, before she's torn
from everything she knows--

134
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,344
kidnapped...

135
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:00,722
hurled into deep space
against her will--

136
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,767
what thoughts fill the mind
of the daring space captive?

137
00:08:04,226 --> 00:08:05,727
Are there boys on Alpha Prime?

138
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:07,854
What will I wear?

139
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:14,611
What will it be like to jettison
your body into deep space?

140
00:08:16,238 --> 00:08:19,366
First...
you'll try holding your breath.

141
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,786
But your blood's
already begun to boil.

142
00:08:23,245 --> 00:08:27,582
Then your skin inflates
like a balloon.

143
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,127
Then...pop.

144
00:08:30,627 --> 00:08:32,421
Do they have a name
for what's wrong with you?

145
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,676
Dad says don't bring them.

146
00:08:38,176 --> 00:08:39,970
Like anything I do
matters to him.

147
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,305
Don't sweat it, kid.

148
00:08:42,806 --> 00:08:46,309
I got apology videos
for two birthdays.

149
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,229
He forgot last year completely.

150
00:08:50,313 --> 00:08:52,941
This mission's the only thing
he cares about anymore.

151
00:08:59,448 --> 00:09:00,741
So that's a no to family dinner?

152
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,826
Let's see.

153
00:09:03,326 --> 00:09:04,828
Do I spend my last night
on Earth...

154
00:09:05,287 --> 00:09:08,331
watching Mom and Dad pretend
not to be fighting again...

155
00:09:08,832 --> 00:09:11,710
or blow 10 years worth
of allowance at the mall?

156
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,379
You do the math.

157
00:09:14,838 --> 00:09:16,131
Mom's gonna go thermal.

158
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:19,092
What's she gonna do,
ground me?

159
00:09:20,677 --> 00:09:23,096
I'm nervous about jamming in
a new pilot the last second.

160
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,931
The Global Sedition
is getting brave.

161
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,100
First the hypergate,
then Daniels.

162
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,561
Next time, they may attack
the launch dome.

163
00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:31,021
We can't afford to wait.

164
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,066
Will's science fair. Reminder.
Apology video for Will.

165
00:09:35,525 --> 00:09:36,359
He'll understand.

166
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,819
Ben, listen.

167
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:41,198
My family is on this mission.

168
00:09:41,656 --> 00:09:43,658
I need a pilot who's
more than just spit and polish.

169
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,494
I've got your man.

170
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,662
He just doesn't know it yet.

171
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:53,752
At ease, Major.

172
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:55,754
Why was I pulled
from active duty?

173
00:09:56,254 --> 00:09:57,672
Those gen-techs
may attack again.

174
00:09:58,757 --> 00:09:59,508
I need to be up there.

175
00:10:00,008 --> 00:10:01,176
Do you know Professor Robinson?

176
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:04,763
By reputation. Your father's
battle strategies...

177
00:10:05,263 --> 00:10:07,224
were required reading
at the academy.

178
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,519
What can you tell me
about the Jupiter mission?

179
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:13,855
The Jupiter
is an oversized robot.

180
00:10:14,773 --> 00:10:16,149
Everything's automatic.

181
00:10:17,859 --> 00:10:18,944
Any monkey in a flight suit...

182
00:10:19,444 --> 00:10:21,112
can pilot that ship
out of the solar system...

183
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:23,323
and set her down on Alpha Prime.

184
00:10:23,782 --> 00:10:26,284
It's a baby-sitting job, sir.

185
00:10:26,743 --> 00:10:27,744
No offence.

186
00:10:28,203 --> 00:10:31,873
Major, are you aware Earth's
resources are severely limited?

187
00:10:32,374 --> 00:10:33,250
Every schoolchild knows...

188
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,545
that our recycling technologies
will cure the environment.

189
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,256
Sending a family
across the galaxy...

190
00:10:39,756 --> 00:10:42,759
is a stunt to sell computers
to people of all ages.

191
00:10:43,218 --> 00:10:44,511
Every schoolchild was lied to.

192
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:47,264
Recycling technologies
came too late.

193
00:10:47,764 --> 00:10:50,433
All fossil fuels
are virtually exhausted.

194
00:10:50,892 --> 00:10:52,978
The ozone layer is down to 40%.

195
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:59,150
In two decades, the earth will
be unable to support human life.

196
00:10:59,609 --> 00:11:02,529
The new Global Sedition knows
the truth as well as we do.

197
00:11:02,988 --> 00:11:04,531
They're building
their own hypergate.

198
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,534
They hope to colonize
Alpha Prime first.

199
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,327
If they're successful...

200
00:11:09,786 --> 00:11:11,871
western demons like you and I,
Major West...

201
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:13,915
will be left on Earth to die.

202
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,376
Captain Daniels doesn't have
the flu, does he?

203
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:19,963
Captain Daniels was murdered
in his apartment last night.

204
00:11:20,422 --> 00:11:22,090
The flu story is a cover.

205
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,801
I flew with Mike.

206
00:11:25,427 --> 00:11:28,013
We should blast their bases!
A decisive strike now!

207
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:29,597
My squadron is alert status--

208
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,933
Your rescue stunt was fool hardy!

209
00:11:32,434 --> 00:11:33,852
I had a friend in trouble.

210
00:11:36,771 --> 00:11:39,190
disobeyed a direct order
because of a friend?

211
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:42,068
I did...

212
00:11:43,153 --> 00:11:44,321
sir.

213
00:11:46,781 --> 00:11:47,949
He'll do.

214
00:11:52,662 --> 00:11:53,830
Congratulations.

215
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,791
You're the new pilot
of the Jupiter mission.

216
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:02,756
Where's my money?

217
00:12:07,385 --> 00:12:09,387
The Sedition hired me
to provide access...

218
00:12:09,846 --> 00:12:11,890
to Daniels' apartment
and no more.

219
00:12:12,348 --> 00:12:14,517
My work is done.

220
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,270
They found a replacement pilot.

221
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,564
Our attack
on the hypergate failed.

222
00:12:20,023 --> 00:12:21,900
How tragic for you.

223
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:26,905
We require a more direct
intervention on your part.

224
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:28,698
I see.

225
00:12:31,242 --> 00:12:33,161
It will cost you.

226
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:38,374
I'm afraid that my price
has just become...

227
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,418
astronomical.

228
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:43,213
Holograph off.

229
00:12:52,764 --> 00:12:53,932
Come in.

230
00:12:59,103 --> 00:13:02,398
Control hasn't received
results of the pre-flight exams.

231
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:05,568
The Robinsons
have checked out 100%.

232
00:13:08,905 --> 00:13:11,491
They're fit as a fiddle
and ready to fly.

233
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,159
Wish them luck...

234
00:13:14,244 --> 00:13:15,495
for me.

235
00:13:22,043 --> 00:13:25,213
Mission protocols are simple.
Robinson is in command...

236
00:13:25,213 --> 00:13:26,381
unless you encounter
a military emergency.

237
00:13:26,881 --> 00:13:28,675
In that case, Major West,
you are in charge.

238
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:31,594
I'm a fighter pilot.
There must be better candidates.

239
00:13:32,095 --> 00:13:34,055
Hell, even my own family
can't stand me.

240
00:13:34,556 --> 00:13:35,974
Shut up.

241
00:13:38,768 --> 00:13:41,062
Jeb Walker.
He's an excellent flyer.

242
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:42,564
He's perfect for this mission.

243
00:13:43,064 --> 00:13:44,357
Welcome aboard, Major.

244
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,544
Looks like somebody sprung
for the full-extras package...

245
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:05,753
on this beauty.

246
00:14:06,254 --> 00:14:10,049
If you have to be a baby-sitter,
it's not such a bad nursery.

247
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,135
Wouldn't you agree?

248
00:14:13,845 --> 00:14:14,596
I don't get it.

249
00:14:15,096 --> 00:14:17,724
I can't get the cryo-sleep
systems up over96%.

250
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,767
Dr Smith approved the specs.

251
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:23,730
Dr Smith is the base physician.
I am responsible in flight.

252
00:14:24,272 --> 00:14:26,065
These tubes will be perfect,
or the ship will not launch.

253
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:27,317
Is that clear?

254
00:14:27,775 --> 00:14:29,944
Absolutely, Doctor.

255
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:33,990
Judy, I want to introduce you
to Major West.

256
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,284
He'll be taking Mike's place.

257
00:14:38,953 --> 00:14:41,372
He's heavier than Mike.
We'll have to recalibrate.

258
00:14:41,998 --> 00:14:44,625
I'd be happy to discuss
my dimensions, Doctor...

259
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,377
say, over dinner?

260
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,963
West.
I've read about you.

261
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:50,798
You're a war hero, aren't you?

262
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,801
Well, yes, actually.

263
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:58,181
Who was it who said,
'Those who can't think, fight'?

264
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,351
I think that it was me.

265
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:03,561
It was nice to have met you.

266
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,444
That's one cold fish
I'd love to thaw.

267
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:15,782
I'm not gonna make it over
for dinner tonight, Dad.

268
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,543
It's gonna be a long flight.

269
00:15:29,837 --> 00:15:31,506
Maureen, pick up the phone,
honey.

270
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:33,132
I know you're there.
Are you still packing?

271
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:35,093
I'm just leaving.
Go to bed.

272
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:48,815
Sweetie?

273
00:15:56,906 --> 00:15:58,199
He won first prize again.

274
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:01,119
Is this the new model
he's been working on?

275
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:08,292
Crazy idea he's got about a...

276
00:16:09,293 --> 00:16:11,212
time machine?

277
00:16:13,631 --> 00:16:16,175
Pretty sharp stuff for a midget.

278
00:16:17,635 --> 00:16:19,345
Sorry about dinner.
That new pilot--

279
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:20,763
John, the family needs you here.

280
00:16:21,264 --> 00:16:24,058
This whole thing
is about family.

281
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:26,352
My only condition
for accepting this mission...

282
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:29,522
was that we could bring
the children with us...

283
00:16:29,981 --> 00:16:30,773
not leave them behind...

284
00:16:31,274 --> 00:16:33,484
so future generations
would have a new home.

285
00:16:33,943 --> 00:16:36,445
You're off saving humanity,
so what does it matter...

286
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:38,739
that Will
has to blackout his school...

287
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,783
to get his father's attention...

288
00:16:41,242 --> 00:16:44,912
Penny's been dragged home
by security 3 nights in a row...

289
00:16:45,413 --> 00:16:47,164
Judy's become a ghost,
like her father?

290
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:49,250
I have to compensate
for the new launch time.

291
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,085
What do you think I'm doing?

292
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:52,587
Revising life-science protocols.

293
00:16:53,087 --> 00:16:54,630
I'm also dealing
with two kids...

294
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:57,133
who are leaving
an entire planet behind.

295
00:16:57,633 --> 00:17:01,345
Sorry, but there's no manuals
on how to deal with this.

296
00:17:04,974 --> 00:17:06,976
Maybe it doesn't do any good...

297
00:17:10,271 --> 00:17:13,983
saving a world of families
if we can't save our own.

298
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,571
Is that it, Professor?

299
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:24,160
John.

300
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:26,787
I know, baby.
I'm scared, too.

301
00:17:57,026 --> 00:17:58,110
Med supplies for the Jupiter 2?

302
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,153
That's our last crate.

303
00:17:59,653 --> 00:18:00,529
What a mess.

304
00:18:00,988 --> 00:18:02,323
They're not taking any chances.

305
00:18:51,455 --> 00:18:54,834
Forgive me if I forego the kiss,
my sleeping behemoth...

306
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:57,753
but the time has come to awake.

307
00:18:58,254 --> 00:18:59,713
Robot is on-line.

308
00:19:00,214 --> 00:19:01,882
Reviewing primary directives.

309
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,386
One--
preserve the Robinson family.

310
00:19:05,886 --> 00:19:07,638
Two--
maintain the ship's systems.

311
00:19:08,139 --> 00:19:11,809
Spare me the chatter,
my steely centurion.

312
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:16,856
Sadly, I fear I have far more
dire deeds in store for you.

313
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,400
Robot is on-line.

314
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,360
Reviewing primary directives.

315
00:19:21,819 --> 00:19:24,822
Sixteen hours into mission,
destroy Robinson family.

316
00:19:25,281 --> 00:19:27,533
Destroy all systems.

317
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,869
That's more like it.

318
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,705
Farewell,
my platinum-plated pal.

319
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,626
Give my regards to oblivion.

320
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:50,306
Apparently you have completed
your mission on schedule.

321
00:19:50,764 --> 00:19:54,184
I do so admire a spot
of timely terrorism.

322
00:19:54,643 --> 00:19:57,146
I thought I told you
never to call me here.

323
00:19:57,605 --> 00:20:00,107
The transmission signal
could be traced.

324
00:20:00,608 --> 00:20:04,153
I just wanted to express
my most sincere gratitude...

325
00:20:04,612 --> 00:20:07,823
for your unflagging loyalty.

326
00:20:08,282 --> 00:20:10,326
Good work, good doctor...

327
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:12,578
and good-bye.

328
00:20:28,552 --> 00:20:31,889
Jupiter 1 launch
in three minutes.

329
00:20:32,348 --> 00:20:33,432
Mom, just--

330
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:34,642
Shoot.

331
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,851
Mom, I'm fine.

332
00:20:36,352 --> 00:20:37,770
That's supposed to be there.

333
00:20:38,854 --> 00:20:41,148
This is almost acceptable.

334
00:20:42,191 --> 00:20:43,776
-Mom, don't.
-What?

335
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:46,278
Vogue says this will be
the style in 10 years.

336
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:47,738
Can we cut back on her oxygen...

337
00:20:48,238 --> 00:20:50,616
so she's not so annoying
when she wakes up?

338
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:51,992
Does he have to wake up at all?

339
00:20:52,493 --> 00:20:54,828
That's it. I'm gonna turn
this spaceship around.

340
00:20:55,329 --> 00:20:58,791
Satellite defence net locked
and A-OK.

341
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:26,735
-Everything's gonna be fine.
-30 seconds. Mark.

342
00:21:27,194 --> 00:21:29,321
-Hey there, buddy.
-Com-links encoded and secure.

343
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,490
-Good night, guys.
-Good night.

344
00:21:31,949 --> 00:21:33,117
Here we go.

345
00:21:33,617 --> 00:21:35,869
Artificial gravity at 100%.

346
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:37,871
You get a 'C'
in paternal expression...

347
00:21:38,372 --> 00:21:40,290
but an 'A' for effort.

348
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:43,168
-I'm doing the best I can.
-Come here.

349
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:49,174
You always get an 'A' in this.

350
00:21:49,633 --> 00:21:51,718
Main drive systems on-line.

351
00:21:52,219 --> 00:21:53,595
Sweet dreams.

352
00:21:54,054 --> 00:21:55,222
See you there.

353
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,561
You are at 'T' minus one minute
and counting, Major West.

354
00:22:09,611 --> 00:22:11,321
Houston, the bird is hot.

355
00:22:14,283 --> 00:22:15,409
She's all yours.

356
00:22:16,994 --> 00:22:19,663
I'll try to give you
a smooth ride.

357
00:22:25,627 --> 00:22:27,546
Mission control,
this is Dr Robinson.

358
00:22:28,005 --> 00:22:29,006
We are in the green.

359
00:22:29,464 --> 00:22:32,968
Roger, Doctor. You are go
to initiate cryo-stasis.

360
00:22:36,513 --> 00:22:37,764
One question.

361
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,935
Is there room
in these tubes for two?

362
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,731
There's barely enough
for you and your ego.

363
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:48,734
Don't sweat it, doc.

364
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:50,736
I do this all the time.

365
00:22:51,194 --> 00:22:52,738
Just drive carefully.

366
00:22:55,032 --> 00:22:57,576
You are at 'T' minus 40 seconds
and counting.

367
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,244
Ready.

368
00:23:09,046 --> 00:23:12,382
You are at 'T' minus
30 seconds and counting.

369
00:23:25,854 --> 00:23:28,315
You are at 'T' minus
20 seconds and counting.

370
00:23:28,815 --> 00:23:30,150
Control, this is Jupiter 1.

371
00:23:30,651 --> 00:23:31,944
The Robinsons are all tucked in.

372
00:23:32,402 --> 00:23:33,278
We are ready to fly.

373
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:37,366
Major West, your escape vector
is clear of all traffic.

374
00:23:37,824 --> 00:23:39,868
Op is go on your command.

375
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:41,536
Roger, Houston.

376
00:23:41,995 --> 00:23:44,414
And the monkey flips the switch.

377
00:24:18,198 --> 00:24:21,159
Jupiter 1 booster disengaged.

378
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:30,377
This is Jupiter 2.

379
00:24:30,877 --> 00:24:34,214
Diverting all spacecraft control
to the main computer.

380
00:24:36,383 --> 00:24:38,301
Eight years of flight training.

381
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:43,390
Navigational holographics
on-line.

382
00:24:43,807 --> 00:24:45,350
Fifty combat missions.

383
00:24:47,727 --> 00:24:50,772
Course confirmed for slingshot
exit of the solar system.

384
00:24:53,275 --> 00:24:57,195
So I can take the family camper
on an interstellar picnic.

385
00:25:00,157 --> 00:25:02,784
Ten years is a lifetime.

386
00:25:04,244 --> 00:25:05,912
Sleep well, old friend.

387
00:25:07,831 --> 00:25:10,417
I never liked
these freezing tubes.

388
00:25:14,004 --> 00:25:15,172
Bad dreams.

389
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:26,725
Navigational interface
confirmed.

390
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:30,145
Cryo-sleep systems at 100%.

391
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,519
Shit!

392
00:26:16,816 --> 00:26:18,568
Robot is on-line.

393
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,947
Sixteen hours into mission,
destroy Robinson family.

394
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:23,990
Destroy all systems.

395
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:26,826
Disable program!

396
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:29,829
Sixteen hours into mission,
destroy Robinson family.

397
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,165
Destroy all systems.

398
00:26:32,707 --> 00:26:34,626
Robot is on-line.

399
00:26:35,085 --> 00:26:36,252
Destroy.

400
00:26:40,882 --> 00:26:43,593
Destroy all operating systems.

401
00:26:44,094 --> 00:26:46,221
Destroy Jupiter 2.

402
00:26:50,183 --> 00:26:52,769
Destroy all operating systems.

403
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:54,813
Destroy Jupiter 2.

404
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:58,149
Destroy cryo-sleep systems.

405
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,656
Destroy.

406
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,708
Destroy navigational systems.

407
00:27:17,293 --> 00:27:19,879
Come on!
Wake up, damn you!

408
00:27:22,298 --> 00:27:25,427
I can't stop this infernal
contraption on my own.

409
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:33,935
Emergency cryo-stasis
desequencing in process.

410
00:27:34,477 --> 00:27:36,771
Destroy all systems.

411
00:27:37,272 --> 00:27:38,148
Destroy Robinson family.

412
00:27:38,648 --> 00:27:40,275
Maureen, the children!

413
00:27:40,734 --> 00:27:41,901
Destroy.

414
00:27:43,027 --> 00:27:44,154
Run!

415
00:27:45,155 --> 00:27:47,449
-Destroy.
-Deactivate safety.

416
00:27:52,287 --> 00:27:54,873
That was a mistake.

417
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:05,884
Dad!

418
00:28:09,304 --> 00:28:10,805
Mom, let's go!

419
00:28:11,514 --> 00:28:15,268
-Will, stop!
-Destroy.

420
00:28:33,203 --> 00:28:34,704
Destroy Jupiter 2.

421
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:40,919
Destroy Robinson family.

422
00:28:54,724 --> 00:28:56,517
Look away, baby.

423
00:28:58,102 --> 00:29:00,230
Robot, disable pulse blaster.

424
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:01,439
Command accepted.

425
00:29:01,898 --> 00:29:04,067
Cancel attack sequence
and stand by.

426
00:29:07,362 --> 00:29:09,781
If the family won't come
to the science fair...

427
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,742
bring the science fair
to the family.

428
00:29:14,577 --> 00:29:15,745
Showoff.

429
00:29:16,871 --> 00:29:17,914
Robot.

430
00:29:18,414 --> 00:29:19,874
On-line. Standing by.

431
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:22,835
Return to docking bay
and power down.

432
00:29:23,378 --> 00:29:24,671
Major, you all right?

433
00:29:25,171 --> 00:29:27,966
Next picnic, no robots.

434
00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:30,593
Where's Judy?

435
00:29:34,347 --> 00:29:36,766
Stabilize the operating systems.

436
00:29:37,266 --> 00:29:38,101
Fire control.

437
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,187
Attempting
containment protocols.

438
00:29:42,438 --> 00:29:44,232
I want to go home now.

439
00:29:44,857 --> 00:29:46,901
Navigation's down.
System shorts everywhere.

440
00:29:47,402 --> 00:29:49,487
Damn.
Communications are out.

441
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:51,656
Link up the secondary system.

442
00:29:52,115 --> 00:29:54,242
-Shunting power from reserve.
-Come on.

443
00:29:54,742 --> 00:29:55,493
Try it now.

444
00:29:56,035 --> 00:29:57,412
Navigational boards are lit.

445
00:29:58,538 --> 00:29:59,956
Can we reroute?

446
00:30:00,456 --> 00:30:02,125
I'm locked out of the helm.

447
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:03,918
Nothing in computer control.

448
00:30:04,377 --> 00:30:05,503
Main com to manual.

449
00:30:05,962 --> 00:30:07,547
See if she'll respond.

450
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:11,342
The main subroutine won't open.
I'm gonna try remote ops.

451
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:14,721
Smith!

452
00:30:15,221 --> 00:30:17,265
Get back!
Get away from me!

453
00:30:17,724 --> 00:30:20,268
What the hell
are you doing here?

454
00:30:20,768 --> 00:30:23,813
Major West,
thank God it's you.

455
00:30:24,272 --> 00:30:26,357
I was in here
doing some last minute checks.

456
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,608
Someone hit me from behind.

457
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:29,777
That's Sedition technology.

458
00:30:30,778 --> 00:30:31,821
You're a damn spy.

459
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,448
You did this.

460
00:30:35,825 --> 00:30:36,743
What are you doing?

461
00:30:37,201 --> 00:30:37,910
Throwing out the trash!

462
00:30:38,411 --> 00:30:39,829
I need help!

463
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,249
I can't get Judy out!
She's dying!

464
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,380
Touch me,
and the girl dies!

465
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:51,549
I don't deal with dead men.

466
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:53,509
Kill me, kill the girl.

467
00:30:55,219 --> 00:30:56,554
How much is your revenge worth?

468
00:30:57,054 --> 00:30:58,598
I can save her life...

469
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:02,602
only if you give me your word
as an officer you'll spare mine.

470
00:31:05,354 --> 00:31:08,649
-Help her.
-I've got helm control.

471
00:31:18,326 --> 00:31:20,369
We're way off course.

472
00:31:23,623 --> 00:31:25,625
We're caught in the sun's
gravitational pull.

473
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:27,710
Is that what that big ball is?

474
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:34,884
We've got four minutes before
the outer hull begins to melt.

475
00:31:35,343 --> 00:31:37,929
I need you to check
on the thruster alignments.

476
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:39,847
Professor!

477
00:31:40,306 --> 00:31:42,308
I'll try for the Mercury mines.

478
00:31:43,684 --> 00:31:45,353
I'll need Dr Robinson's
portable gurney.

479
00:31:45,811 --> 00:31:46,729
You'll find it below.

480
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,232
Smith, come on!

481
00:31:52,276 --> 00:31:54,153
You tried to kill my family.

482
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:55,404
We trusted you.

483
00:31:55,905 --> 00:31:57,990
It's the world behind the world,
Professor Robinson.

484
00:31:58,491 --> 00:32:01,827
Lie once, cheat twice,
and everything becomes clear.

485
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:06,666
Do not mistake my deception
for a character flaw.

486
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:08,000
It is a philosophical choice...

487
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:11,003
that I've found
in a study of the universe.

488
00:32:11,504 --> 00:32:12,505
It is a way of life.

489
00:32:12,922 --> 00:32:13,965
You're a monster.

490
00:32:14,507 --> 00:32:16,717
Perhaps,
but I'm also the only one...

491
00:32:17,218 --> 00:32:19,095
who can save Judy's life.

492
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:23,099
Penny, precious, I want you to
short the power on my command.

493
00:32:23,557 --> 00:32:25,309
Does he have to call me
precious?

494
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,146
Penny, precious.

495
00:32:30,439 --> 00:32:32,024
Now!

496
00:32:37,405 --> 00:32:38,823
She's not breathing.

497
00:32:39,282 --> 00:32:40,783
Sick bay, move!

498
00:32:41,284 --> 00:32:42,243
The sun won't let us go.

499
00:32:42,702 --> 00:32:44,161
Heat shield breach,
60 seconds.

500
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:45,371
I need options, Professor.

501
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,873
We have to divert all power
to the engines.

502
00:32:48,582 --> 00:32:50,167
I'm rerouting life sciences.

503
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,461
Rerouting life support.

504
00:32:52,962 --> 00:32:54,839
Engines at80%.

505
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:59,552
There's no cardiopulmonary
or respiratory functions.

506
00:33:09,186 --> 00:33:10,479
Clear.

507
00:33:11,981 --> 00:33:13,566
Again. Clear.

508
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:21,741
Alert.

509
00:33:22,241 --> 00:33:23,367
Medical.

510
00:33:24,785 --> 00:33:25,536
Rerouting error.

511
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:27,496
Systems are crashing.

512
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:33,252
We're losing her. Do something.

513
00:33:44,138 --> 00:33:45,306
Come on, child.

514
00:33:47,349 --> 00:33:49,435
Put a little heart into it.

515
00:33:50,644 --> 00:33:52,104
The other life I save...

516
00:33:53,397 --> 00:33:55,191
will be my own.

517
00:33:56,358 --> 00:33:59,653
Wake up, baby, please.

518
00:34:01,864 --> 00:34:03,657
That's all the power we've got.

519
00:34:04,158 --> 00:34:06,160
I'm putting the pedal
to the metal. Here it goes.

520
00:34:21,675 --> 00:34:24,845
She can't break free.
She doesn't have enough thrust.

521
00:34:25,304 --> 00:34:28,098
There's got to be a way
to get through this.

522
00:34:29,183 --> 00:34:30,309
That's it.

523
00:34:35,105 --> 00:34:35,814
It's working!

524
00:34:36,273 --> 00:34:37,525
What is?

525
00:34:38,067 --> 00:34:40,361
If we can't go around the sun,
we go straight through it...

526
00:34:40,861 --> 00:34:41,654
using your hyperdrive.

527
00:34:42,196 --> 00:34:43,948
Engage the hyperdrive
without a gate?

528
00:34:44,406 --> 00:34:46,450
We could be thrown
anywhere in the galaxy.

529
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:48,118
Anywhere but here.

530
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:56,293
On my mark.

531
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:03,884
Three, two, one, initiate.

532
00:35:27,783 --> 00:35:30,244
Hyperdrive at 100%.

533
00:35:31,537 --> 00:35:34,540
Major, you have the com.

534
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,294
Dad? Dad!

535
00:35:40,462 --> 00:35:42,423
Let's see what this baby can do.

536
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:20,586
Maureen, everyone?

537
00:36:22,671 --> 00:36:23,756
-Where is Judy?
-She's OK.

538
00:36:24,214 --> 00:36:27,092
She is, thanks to me.

539
00:36:28,135 --> 00:36:29,470
Here I am.

540
00:36:29,928 --> 00:36:31,764
Either I should cut down
on the liquids...

541
00:36:32,222 --> 00:36:34,516
or I should sew in a new flap
because it was really hell...

542
00:36:35,017 --> 00:36:35,934
getting out of that thing.

543
00:36:36,393 --> 00:36:37,186
You're...

544
00:36:37,644 --> 00:36:39,772
Vitals are normal. Pulse
and respiration seem to be.

545
00:36:40,314 --> 00:36:41,815
-Are you OK?
-I'm fine.

546
00:36:42,357 --> 00:36:43,442
Come here.

547
00:36:44,651 --> 00:36:48,405
Will every little problem be an
excuse for familial sentiment?

548
00:36:52,618 --> 00:36:53,744
How much, Smith?

549
00:36:55,162 --> 00:36:59,166
What was the price tag
that you put on our future?

550
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:17,226
You can't do it, can you, John?

551
00:37:17,726 --> 00:37:21,980
You can't kill the man
without becoming the monster.

552
00:37:31,365 --> 00:37:32,574
Coward.

553
00:37:40,624 --> 00:37:43,460
What's happened, John?
Where are we?

554
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,177
I bypassed
most of the damaged systems.

555
00:37:52,678 --> 00:37:54,513
We'll have to repair the rest
manually.

556
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:57,975
You had me worried, doc.

557
00:37:58,475 --> 00:37:59,935
Nice to see you thawed.

558
00:38:00,435 --> 00:38:02,980
You have a puzzling definition
of a smooth ride.

559
00:38:03,438 --> 00:38:07,568
Computer,
map our current position.

560
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:12,614
Searching
for recognizable constellations.

561
00:38:15,701 --> 00:38:19,621
This database has star maps
of all the known galaxy.

562
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,583
I don't recognize
a single system.

563
00:38:25,294 --> 00:38:26,878
We're lost....

564
00:38:28,213 --> 00:38:29,423
aren't we?

565
00:38:45,689 --> 00:38:46,648
Easy, doc. God.

566
00:38:47,107 --> 00:38:47,858
Please.

567
00:38:48,358 --> 00:38:51,069
The cryosuit absorbed
most of the electrical charge.

568
00:38:51,611 --> 00:38:53,905
You're lucky
this wasn't your hide.

569
00:38:54,364 --> 00:38:58,160
Doctor, is that concern
I detect in your voice?

570
00:39:00,245 --> 00:39:02,497
Great bedside manner.

571
00:39:05,292 --> 00:39:06,501
What's that?

572
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,545
A battle scar?

573
00:39:09,921 --> 00:39:11,006
Sort of.

574
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:13,383
It was a tattoo.

575
00:39:13,842 --> 00:39:17,554
An ex-girl friend's name,
but I had it removed.

576
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:20,182
Wouldn't it be easier
to use a magic marker?

577
00:39:22,142 --> 00:39:23,894
Yeah, well, that's me.

578
00:39:24,394 --> 00:39:26,438
A girl in every port.

579
00:39:26,938 --> 00:39:28,106
So, Major, no family?

580
00:39:28,607 --> 00:39:31,151
Nothing to tie you down,
no one to miss?

581
00:39:31,651 --> 00:39:34,905
I've never been
the fit-in and play-nice type.

582
00:39:37,407 --> 00:39:38,950
You think that's romantic?

583
00:39:41,745 --> 00:39:42,871
I don't.

584
00:39:44,289 --> 00:39:46,208
But what about you, doc?

585
00:39:46,666 --> 00:39:49,294
Is there some lucky little nerd
you left behind?

586
00:39:50,462 --> 00:39:52,672
I spent three years working
on this mission.

587
00:39:53,131 --> 00:39:54,800
We're trying to save the planet.

588
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,052
I haven't had time for fun.

589
00:39:57,511 --> 00:40:00,305
If there's no time for fun...

590
00:40:00,764 --> 00:40:03,183
then what are we saving
the planet for?

591
00:40:14,778 --> 00:40:15,570
Here.

592
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:16,780
Thanks.

593
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:18,782
I hate being little.

594
00:40:25,413 --> 00:40:27,374
I think it broke.

595
00:40:29,876 --> 00:40:30,794
I'll try and fix it.

596
00:40:31,294 --> 00:40:33,463
Why aren't you up on deck
with Mom and Dad?

597
00:40:33,922 --> 00:40:34,881
Have you met our parents?

598
00:40:35,382 --> 00:40:36,550
Good point.

599
00:40:38,593 --> 00:40:39,803
Popcorn, orchids...

600
00:40:40,262 --> 00:40:42,848
waves, Billy...

601
00:40:43,306 --> 00:40:44,975
kissing.

602
00:40:46,935 --> 00:40:48,144
Chocolate.

603
00:40:49,187 --> 00:40:50,814
It's a list...

604
00:40:53,024 --> 00:40:54,526
of everything we left behind.

605
00:40:59,656 --> 00:41:01,157
Never love anything, kid do...

606
00:41:02,534 --> 00:41:04,578
'cause you just end up
losing it.

607
00:41:14,921 --> 00:41:17,173
Smith could still hurt us.

608
00:41:19,301 --> 00:41:21,344
Maybe I shouldn't let him live.

609
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:28,268
But...

610
00:41:28,727 --> 00:41:30,895
How can we bring
civilization to the stars...

611
00:41:31,354 --> 00:41:33,273
if we can't remain civilized?
Right, Professor?

612
00:41:33,773 --> 00:41:36,776
Have you noticed that you
take the opposite position...

613
00:41:37,277 --> 00:41:38,695
to whatever I say?

614
00:41:39,154 --> 00:41:40,238
Of course I do.

615
00:41:40,697 --> 00:41:42,449
We're married.

616
00:41:44,909 --> 00:41:45,702
Alert.

617
00:41:46,161 --> 00:41:48,663
Spatial anomaly in progress.

618
00:41:49,122 --> 00:41:51,249
What the hell?

619
00:41:59,716 --> 00:42:02,427
I must be dreaming.
That looks like a ship.

620
00:42:02,427 --> 00:42:05,555
It appears to be some sort
of hole in space.

621
00:42:06,097 --> 00:42:07,724
Where does it lead?

622
00:42:08,224 --> 00:42:09,934
A reasonable question.

623
00:42:14,022 --> 00:42:15,523
Major, wait.

624
00:42:16,024 --> 00:42:17,192
I'll wait later.

625
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,033
Pull back.

626
00:42:25,492 --> 00:42:27,243
Let there be light.

627
00:42:56,064 --> 00:42:57,148
Proteus?

628
00:42:58,691 --> 00:43:00,693
She's one of ours, all right.

629
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,448
All right.

630
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:08,993
I've never seen a ship
like this.

631
00:43:12,455 --> 00:43:14,749
No response to hails.

632
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:18,545
Scanning all military
and civilian frequencies.

633
00:43:19,045 --> 00:43:19,754
Nothing.

634
00:43:20,213 --> 00:43:22,715
I'm getting
inconsistent life signs...

635
00:43:23,216 --> 00:43:25,593
but they may be sensor ghosts.

636
00:43:27,887 --> 00:43:29,430
Computer is still on.

637
00:43:31,057 --> 00:43:33,184
I'll try the standard
docking codes.

638
00:43:33,726 --> 00:43:35,353
Control codes confirmed.

639
00:43:35,854 --> 00:43:37,397
Initiating docking sequence.

640
00:43:42,235 --> 00:43:44,821
Weird.
What kind of ship is that?

641
00:43:45,238 --> 00:43:47,157
That's not one of ours.

642
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:02,171
Boys, that's not even human.

643
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,049
If this is all a dream...

644
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:07,677
why can't there be more girls?

645
00:44:13,975 --> 00:44:15,768
As part of her enslavement...

646
00:44:16,227 --> 00:44:19,147
the brave young space captive
Penny Robinson...

647
00:44:19,647 --> 00:44:26,279
is forced to utilize her
dazzling technical expertise.

648
00:44:35,163 --> 00:44:35,872
Identify yourself, soldier.

649
00:44:36,331 --> 00:44:39,709
West, Major,
United Global Space Force...

650
00:44:40,168 --> 00:44:42,587
requesting permission
to see the prisoner.

651
00:44:46,633 --> 00:44:51,220
Proceed, Major West.

652
00:45:02,023 --> 00:45:04,317
Could he be cuter?

653
00:45:06,402 --> 00:45:07,612
I don't think so.

654
00:45:08,112 --> 00:45:10,031
Breathe, Penny.

655
00:45:14,327 --> 00:45:15,495
Unlock.

656
00:45:25,129 --> 00:45:26,422
These quarters are unacceptable.

657
00:45:26,923 --> 00:45:29,384
We're going to check out
the probe ship.

658
00:45:29,884 --> 00:45:32,387
Maybe we can figure out how they
got here and how to get home.

659
00:45:32,887 --> 00:45:34,430
Have a wonderful trip.

660
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:37,725
Put this on.

661
00:45:42,313 --> 00:45:43,606
You're coming with us.

662
00:45:44,107 --> 00:45:47,151
Out of the question. I am
a doctor, not a space explorer.

663
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:49,862
What you are
is a murderous saboteur.

664
00:45:50,363 --> 00:45:51,197
I am not leaving you here...

665
00:45:51,614 --> 00:45:53,908
so you can do more harm
than you've already caused.

666
00:45:54,409 --> 00:45:55,701
I absolutely refuse.

667
00:45:57,703 --> 00:45:59,831
Give me an excuse to kill you.

668
00:46:01,207 --> 00:46:02,542
Please?

669
00:46:10,258 --> 00:46:13,177
Black was always my colour.

670
00:46:17,181 --> 00:46:18,391
Lock.

671
00:46:30,111 --> 00:46:32,071
Activate standby.

672
00:46:32,572 --> 00:46:35,199
Crush, kill, destroy.

673
00:46:38,286 --> 00:46:39,745
Surprise.

674
00:46:40,246 --> 00:46:41,414
Safety on.

675
00:46:42,874 --> 00:46:44,417
Dad, chill.
It's OK.

676
00:46:44,917 --> 00:46:47,086
I hacked into his CPU,
and then...

677
00:46:47,545 --> 00:46:50,339
I bypassed
his main operating systems...

678
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,259
and accessed his subroutines.

679
00:46:53,676 --> 00:46:56,596
He's basically just running
on remote control.

680
00:46:59,182 --> 00:47:01,058
I know I haven't been around--

681
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:02,685
Professor.

682
00:47:04,353 --> 00:47:05,730
We're ready to go.

683
00:47:08,065 --> 00:47:09,901
We'll talk later, son.

684
00:47:14,363 --> 00:47:15,948
Take care of my dad.

685
00:47:16,407 --> 00:47:18,034
OK, Robot?

686
00:47:27,668 --> 00:47:30,254
Vacuum check complete.

687
00:47:52,944 --> 00:47:54,070
Oxygen levels are normal.

688
00:47:54,528 --> 00:47:55,655
Microbe scans are negative.

689
00:47:56,113 --> 00:47:57,615
Clear.

690
00:48:01,494 --> 00:48:03,287
The air is stale, old.

691
00:48:03,788 --> 00:48:06,207
That's the smell of ghosts.

692
00:48:08,876 --> 00:48:11,754
I've got
her on-board computer up.

693
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,839
Not working?

694
00:48:14,298 --> 00:48:15,383
She's working, all right.

695
00:48:15,841 --> 00:48:16,926
Just--I don't know.

696
00:48:17,385 --> 00:48:19,553
Too damn fast.

697
00:49:02,638 --> 00:49:04,849
Dad, do you hear something?

698
00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:06,851
Like the drip, drip of blood.

699
00:49:07,351 --> 00:49:09,728
You really need to shut up.

700
00:49:11,439 --> 00:49:12,565
Here.

701
00:49:23,951 --> 00:49:25,828
This matter appears biological.

702
00:49:26,871 --> 00:49:28,247
Nothing good will come of this.

703
00:49:28,747 --> 00:49:31,667
You, of course, being the expert
on space exploration.

704
00:49:34,211 --> 00:49:35,379
Let's go.

705
00:49:37,089 --> 00:49:38,674
Trust me, Major.

706
00:49:39,967 --> 00:49:42,970
Evil knows evil.

707
00:50:10,122 --> 00:50:11,832
Motion sensors
are still working.

708
00:50:12,249 --> 00:50:13,417
This way.

709
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:33,812
Rambler-crane series robots.

710
00:50:34,313 --> 00:50:36,649
But like no design
I've ever seen.

711
00:50:37,107 --> 00:50:38,651
Well, well.

712
00:50:39,735 --> 00:50:41,528
Aren't we the poor cousin?

713
00:50:41,987 --> 00:50:43,530
Down here.

714
00:50:52,247 --> 00:50:54,124
It's a remote op station.

715
00:50:55,292 --> 00:50:56,835
Come on, Dr Smith.

716
00:50:59,713 --> 00:51:01,548
Could this ship be a prototype?

717
00:51:02,758 --> 00:51:04,843
Looks like some kind
of firefight.

718
00:51:07,179 --> 00:51:09,264
Captain's log is degraded.

719
00:51:10,391 --> 00:51:14,019
Maybe I can gather
some fragments.

720
00:51:18,023 --> 00:51:18,732
Sorry.

721
00:51:21,944 --> 00:51:24,363
The hyperspace tracker seems
to be functioning normally...

722
00:51:24,863 --> 00:51:28,200
but we cannot process
all the data.

723
00:51:29,535 --> 00:51:32,329
There is no sign
of the Jupiter 2.

724
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:35,666
I have exceeded my timetable.

725
00:51:39,169 --> 00:51:40,295
When did he make Major?

726
00:51:40,754 --> 00:51:42,548
I want this on the record.

727
00:51:43,006 --> 00:51:46,719
I am not willing to give up.

728
00:51:47,177 --> 00:51:48,804
Don would keep looking for me.

729
00:51:56,353 --> 00:51:58,939
That's it. The rest
of the data's totally corrupted.

730
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,859
How could they launch
a rescue mission for us...

731
00:52:02,276 --> 00:52:04,194
when we've only been lost a day?

732
00:52:04,695 --> 00:52:07,448
There's no data
on the alien ship...

733
00:52:07,948 --> 00:52:10,951
but they brought in something
that was attached to its hull.

734
00:52:12,995 --> 00:52:14,079
Got it.

735
00:52:19,418 --> 00:52:21,170
Some sort of egg sac?

736
00:52:33,265 --> 00:52:34,016
Get back here!

737
00:52:34,475 --> 00:52:37,394
Be happy to oblige...

738
00:52:37,853 --> 00:52:39,855
although I don't think it's me
you should be worrying about...

739
00:52:40,314 --> 00:52:41,857
but rather these.

740
00:52:48,405 --> 00:52:49,740
I'm detecting motion.

741
00:52:50,199 --> 00:52:51,742
Behind you.

742
00:52:54,161 --> 00:52:55,287
After it. Move!

743
00:53:00,083 --> 00:53:00,876
Bring Smith.

744
00:53:01,335 --> 00:53:04,171
Don't even think about it.

745
00:53:24,066 --> 00:53:24,983
Hydroponics.

746
00:53:25,484 --> 00:53:28,445
Growth like this
would take decades.

747
00:53:30,155 --> 00:53:32,491
Unhand me, you mechanical moron.

748
00:53:35,953 --> 00:53:37,996
Don't move.

749
00:53:47,214 --> 00:53:48,298
Easy.

750
00:53:48,799 --> 00:53:50,717
Easy there, buddy.

751
00:53:51,134 --> 00:53:52,970
No one's gonna hurt you.

752
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:57,224
Easy.

753
00:53:59,476 --> 00:54:01,103
Relax.

754
00:54:07,609 --> 00:54:09,027
Excellent.

755
00:54:09,444 --> 00:54:11,655
Looks like you made a friend.

756
00:54:12,155 --> 00:54:12,864
Still, I'd wait a few weeks...

757
00:54:13,365 --> 00:54:15,325
before tattooing
her name on your arm.

758
00:54:17,744 --> 00:54:18,912
Do yourself a favour.

759
00:54:19,371 --> 00:54:20,580
Don't evolve.

760
00:54:21,873 --> 00:54:23,917
Charming.

761
00:54:24,459 --> 00:54:25,752
The Dr Dolittle of outer space.

762
00:54:26,211 --> 00:54:29,464
This could be a creature
from that alien ship.

763
00:54:29,923 --> 00:54:31,299
But this guy's no pilot.

764
00:54:31,758 --> 00:54:33,927
He looks like a child.

765
00:54:50,318 --> 00:54:53,113
Try it now.

766
00:54:56,992 --> 00:54:58,702
Strange.

767
00:54:59,202 --> 00:55:01,329
The scales are giving off heat.

768
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:04,416
I've tapped into
the internal sensor array.

769
00:55:06,418 --> 00:55:08,837
There's no other
animate life present.

770
00:55:09,296 --> 00:55:11,923
Besides us,
this ship is totally deserted.

771
00:55:12,382 --> 00:55:14,342
A ghost ship.

772
00:55:14,801 --> 00:55:18,847
The flavour of the day
is banana beef.

773
00:55:21,057 --> 00:55:23,477
Who thinks up
these combinations?

774
00:55:31,777 --> 00:55:32,611
Good.

775
00:55:33,069 --> 00:55:35,739
Major West, I highly
recommend you never breed.

776
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:40,202
That, by the way,
is my medical opinion.

777
00:56:00,722 --> 00:56:01,765
Little thing was hungry.

778
00:56:02,265 --> 00:56:03,892
I've got their star maps
on-line.

779
00:56:04,392 --> 00:56:05,894
Here we go.

780
00:56:06,394 --> 00:56:08,897
More systems
than I've ever seen.

781
00:56:09,356 --> 00:56:12,067
Finding a route to Alpha Prime.

782
00:56:12,526 --> 00:56:15,111
Downloading to Jupiter.

783
00:56:30,126 --> 00:56:32,379
I don't like the sound
of that sound.

784
00:56:41,137 --> 00:56:42,472
They're moving.

785
00:56:52,315 --> 00:56:54,150
Get this infernal...

786
00:56:54,567 --> 00:56:56,611
creature off me!

787
00:56:57,153 --> 00:56:57,862
Come here.

788
00:56:58,321 --> 00:57:00,991
John, get the hell out of there.

789
00:57:01,449 --> 00:57:04,119
Mom says,
'Get the hell out of there.'

790
00:57:33,148 --> 00:57:33,940
Evacuate.

791
00:57:34,399 --> 00:57:35,942
Now!

792
00:57:47,537 --> 00:57:48,997
The controls are too slow.

793
00:57:49,414 --> 00:57:50,665
Activate holographic interface.

794
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:54,002
Holographic interface, on-line.

795
00:58:16,733 --> 00:58:19,402
They eat their wounded.

796
00:58:29,871 --> 00:58:31,331
Seal the bulkhead.

797
00:58:33,124 --> 00:58:34,250
Codes are locked.

798
00:58:39,589 --> 00:58:41,341
Duck.

799
00:58:44,219 --> 00:58:47,180
Emergency bulkhead.

800
00:58:55,688 --> 00:58:57,857
Fire sensor activated.

801
00:58:58,358 --> 00:59:00,026
Emergency bulkhead closure.

802
00:59:02,529 --> 00:59:03,822
Stop!

803
00:59:04,364 --> 00:59:06,407
We have to get that door open.

804
00:59:12,622 --> 00:59:13,289
Open, damn you!

805
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:15,792
Get out of here.

806
00:59:16,292 --> 00:59:19,462
What is with me
and these damn doors?

807
00:59:19,963 --> 00:59:22,799
I can't override
the fire protocol!

808
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:27,345
A million bucks
worth of weaponry...

809
00:59:28,513 --> 00:59:30,431
and I'd trade it all back...

810
00:59:31,516 --> 00:59:32,767
for a lousy...

811
00:59:34,394 --> 00:59:35,520
can of Raid.

812
00:59:51,494 --> 00:59:53,288
Stand clear.

813
01:00:07,385 --> 01:00:09,345
Get moving! Go!

814
01:00:15,768 --> 01:00:16,978
Come on!

815
01:00:17,437 --> 01:00:19,814
Maureen...
can you get me anything?

816
01:00:20,273 --> 01:00:22,525
Cycling through a vacuum check.
I'm overriding.

817
01:00:32,452 --> 01:00:34,329
No way it's that easy.

818
01:01:04,734 --> 01:01:06,319
Run!

819
01:01:08,446 --> 01:01:10,823
Run! Get back!
Get back to the ship!

820
01:01:11,282 --> 01:01:12,909
Move!

821
01:01:25,713 --> 01:01:27,048
Got it. Try it now.

822
01:01:27,548 --> 01:01:29,801
Mom says, 'Try it now.'

823
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:44,816
Can we save it?

824
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:48,194
Can't without letting
the spiders into the ship.

825
01:01:48,653 --> 01:01:50,404
Leave him behind!

826
01:01:58,371 --> 01:02:01,833
That spider scratched me!

827
01:02:02,875 --> 01:02:04,752
Stop laughing, you little worm.

828
01:02:16,931 --> 01:02:18,057
Good-bye, Robot.

829
01:02:20,017 --> 01:02:20,977
You couldn't save him, kid.

830
01:02:21,435 --> 01:02:23,145
Save him? Of course.

831
01:02:29,277 --> 01:02:30,444
What are you trying to do?

832
01:02:34,031 --> 01:02:35,408
Prepare to disengage!

833
01:02:44,709 --> 01:02:46,544
This is a fun picnic.

834
01:02:47,003 --> 01:02:50,172
First yellow aliens,
now giant spiders.

835
01:03:00,057 --> 01:03:01,309
The crowd goes wild.

836
01:03:01,767 --> 01:03:03,519
Recall your childhood
nightmares, Major.

837
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:05,313
Monsters are rarely
so easily dissuaded.

838
01:03:05,813 --> 01:03:08,357
Why don't you talk to them,
bug to bug?

839
01:03:08,858 --> 01:03:10,901
I think
they'd rather come inside.

840
01:03:20,202 --> 01:03:21,996
Arming torpedoes.

841
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,166
Fire in the hole.

842
01:03:31,547 --> 01:03:34,216
Alert. Detonation failure.

843
01:03:36,552 --> 01:03:38,429
The robot must have damaged
the detonator cores.

844
01:03:38,929 --> 01:03:40,348
They won't blow.

845
01:03:40,765 --> 01:03:44,643
Alert.
Outer hub has been compromised.

846
01:03:45,895 --> 01:03:47,980
DNA extrapolation coming up.

847
01:03:48,522 --> 01:03:51,817
Silicone-based, mantium shell,
lack of respiratory system.

848
01:03:52,276 --> 01:03:54,320
Means they do live
in deep space.

849
01:03:56,530 --> 01:03:58,866
Tiny front brain implies
communal relationships.

850
01:03:59,367 --> 01:04:00,076
Like bees.

851
01:04:00,534 --> 01:04:02,870
If the biology lesson is over,
I could use some help.

852
01:04:03,329 --> 01:04:05,956
They may be attracted
to heat and light.

853
01:04:07,917 --> 01:04:11,045
Inner hull breach in 15 seconds.

854
01:04:11,504 --> 01:04:13,672
I'm bringing the Proteus
fusion drives on-line.

855
01:04:26,811 --> 01:04:27,561
It's working.

856
01:04:28,062 --> 01:04:29,522
Let's turn up the heat.

857
01:04:30,022 --> 01:04:30,773
What are you doing?

858
01:04:31,315 --> 01:04:32,817
Never leave an enemy stronghold
intact.

859
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:34,068
Stop!

860
01:04:34,527 --> 01:04:36,153
That's one of your father's
first rules of engagement.

861
01:04:36,612 --> 01:04:37,446
That is a direct order.

862
01:04:37,905 --> 01:04:39,073
I hate spiders.

863
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,309
That's coming fast.

864
01:05:07,768 --> 01:05:09,603
Get into the harnesses now.

865
01:05:10,062 --> 01:05:12,231
Manual helm, engage.

866
01:05:14,066 --> 01:05:15,693
-Children, secure?
-Secure.

867
01:05:16,151 --> 01:05:17,319
I'm in.

868
01:05:36,755 --> 01:05:38,215
Pull up.

869
01:05:38,674 --> 01:05:40,259
Really? No kidding.
Thanks.

870
01:05:45,306 --> 01:05:47,224
Coming in too hot.
I'll try and slow us down.

871
01:06:18,172 --> 01:06:19,298
Hang on!

872
01:06:41,653 --> 01:06:42,738
Everybody by the numbers.

873
01:06:43,197 --> 01:06:44,782
Life sciences,
still breathing.

874
01:06:47,034 --> 01:06:49,578
Video mechanics...
OK.

875
01:06:50,037 --> 01:06:51,789
Mission medical, I'm alive.

876
01:06:52,206 --> 01:06:53,791
Me, too.
Robotics, I mean.

877
01:06:54,208 --> 01:06:55,334
I'm alive...

878
01:06:55,834 --> 01:06:59,171
Major West's poor excuse for
piloting skills notwithstanding.

879
01:06:59,671 --> 01:07:02,383
Oh, Dorothy.

880
01:07:02,925 --> 01:07:04,468
Back in Kansas at last.

881
01:07:33,872 --> 01:07:36,125
You violated a direct order.

882
01:07:37,376 --> 01:07:39,419
About half the core
material's burned out.

883
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,255
We'll never generate
enough power to break orbit.

884
01:07:41,755 --> 01:07:42,756
We can get off the ground...

885
01:07:43,173 --> 01:07:45,134
but getting back into space
is another story.

886
01:07:45,676 --> 01:07:49,221
I ordered you not to blow
that ship's reactors.

887
01:07:49,763 --> 01:07:52,391
Life support is marginal.

888
01:07:52,933 --> 01:07:53,892
It's gonna get cold in here
tonight.

889
01:07:54,309 --> 01:07:58,313
Also, the pod and the chariot
are pretty much scrap metal.

890
01:07:58,772 --> 01:08:00,274
Don't you walk away from me
when I'm talking to you.

891
01:08:00,774 --> 01:08:02,276
Give it a rest, Professor.

892
01:08:02,776 --> 01:08:04,194
I was technically
still in command.

893
01:08:04,611 --> 01:08:06,780
I am commander of this mission.

894
01:08:07,239 --> 01:08:08,407
Look, no offence...

895
01:08:08,866 --> 01:08:11,076
but you're an egghead
with an honorary rank.

896
01:08:11,577 --> 01:08:14,288
No one ever intended for you
to handle combat situations.

897
01:08:14,705 --> 01:08:17,791
You handled it brilliantly,
sending us crashing down here.

898
01:08:18,292 --> 01:08:21,003
Those aliens posed
a continuing threat.

899
01:08:21,503 --> 01:08:22,671
I made a judgement call...

900
01:08:23,171 --> 01:08:25,424
and, if I have to,
I'll make it again.

901
01:08:25,883 --> 01:08:27,259
You of all people
should understand that.

902
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:28,719
Your father would back me up.

903
01:08:29,177 --> 01:08:29,928
My father is dead...

904
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:34,683
killed in one of those combat
missions you admire so much.

905
01:08:35,142 --> 01:08:37,144
My family is on this ship,
and you will follow my orders...

906
01:08:37,686 --> 01:08:39,688
whether you agree with them
or not. Is that clear?

907
01:08:40,105 --> 01:08:40,856
Save your speeches.

908
01:08:41,356 --> 01:08:42,941
I like you, but I'm gonna
do whatever it takes...

909
01:08:43,442 --> 01:08:44,776
to ensure the success
of this mission...

910
01:08:45,193 --> 01:08:47,529
with or without your help.
Is that clear?

911
01:08:47,988 --> 01:08:49,448
Am I interrupting something?

912
01:08:49,948 --> 01:08:51,950
No, really.

913
01:08:52,409 --> 01:08:54,536
I think you two
should slug it out.

914
01:08:56,663 --> 01:08:59,166
Here we are,
stranded on an alien world...

915
01:08:59,625 --> 01:09:01,293
and you want
to get into a pissing contest?

916
01:09:01,793 --> 01:09:03,879
Please, go for it.

917
01:09:04,379 --> 01:09:06,965
I'll have Judy down here
to declare you both unfit...

918
01:09:07,466 --> 01:09:08,216
and I'll take over this mission.

919
01:09:08,634 --> 01:09:12,054
I don't want to hear another
word from you. Is that clear?

920
01:09:13,138 --> 01:09:15,807
Not...another word.

921
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:17,476
Better.

922
01:09:18,518 --> 01:09:20,937
If you've finished hosing down
the decks with testosterone...

923
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:23,065
I suggest you come with me.

924
01:09:23,607 --> 01:09:25,400
I may have found a way
off this planet.

925
01:09:30,572 --> 01:09:32,324
Tell me about it.

926
01:10:11,321 --> 01:10:12,823
Damn bug bite.

927
01:10:30,006 --> 01:10:31,883
She...

928
01:10:32,384 --> 01:10:35,929
She really is an interesting
specimen. Huh, doc?

929
01:10:36,346 --> 01:10:37,639
She's fascinating.

930
01:10:39,349 --> 01:10:40,851
The retinal aperture dilation...

931
01:10:41,309 --> 01:10:43,937
seems directly linked
to the skin pigmentation.

932
01:10:47,065 --> 01:10:48,150
What?

933
01:10:50,193 --> 01:10:51,361
Can I keep her?

934
01:10:54,823 --> 01:10:57,826
She's not just another fad
you can pick up and throw away.

935
01:10:58,326 --> 01:11:00,370
Oh, please.

936
01:11:00,787 --> 01:11:03,707
She's all alone here, and
I promise I'll look out for her.

937
01:11:04,207 --> 01:11:05,876
I promise.

938
01:11:09,504 --> 01:11:11,089
She kind of needs me.

939
01:11:15,594 --> 01:11:17,304
The minute you misplace her,
you forget to feed her--

940
01:11:17,762 --> 01:11:19,848
Don't smile. I mean it, Pen.

941
01:11:21,266 --> 01:11:23,018
Thanks...doc.

942
01:11:26,354 --> 01:11:30,400
We're both a long way from home,
aren't we, little one?

943
01:11:34,321 --> 01:11:35,488
Blarp?

944
01:11:40,744 --> 01:11:43,455
That's what we'll call you--
Blarp.

945
01:11:49,502 --> 01:11:50,545
Nice girl.

946
01:11:51,004 --> 01:11:52,547
Pretty girl.

947
01:12:01,014 --> 01:12:02,140
Nice.

948
01:12:06,144 --> 01:12:09,481
The atmosphere here
can sustain human life.

949
01:12:09,898 --> 01:12:12,859
I've located 500 rads
of radioactive material...

950
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:14,819
five miles west.

951
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:18,239
We'll need at least that much to
get the core functioning again.

952
01:12:19,324 --> 01:12:20,784
We start out at daybreak.

953
01:12:24,454 --> 01:12:25,830
Be safer that way.

954
01:12:28,959 --> 01:12:30,794
Those are my orders.

955
01:12:38,968 --> 01:12:41,304
I agree
with your recommendation.

956
01:12:42,722 --> 01:12:44,224
Dtente's a beautiful thing.

957
01:12:52,190 --> 01:12:54,359
It's nice to see you found
a corner to suit your talents.

958
01:12:54,776 --> 01:12:56,444
Turn down the bed
before you leave.

959
01:12:56,903 --> 01:12:59,197
I gave my word I'd let you live.

960
01:13:00,824 --> 01:13:01,700
I never said for how long.

961
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:04,828
Family hour is over.

962
01:13:05,286 --> 01:13:06,830
We're dying here.

963
01:13:07,288 --> 01:13:10,250
Robinson is out of his league.

964
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:15,338
Look into his eyes and tell me
you can't see his fear.

965
01:13:17,966 --> 01:13:20,385
I fought in the millennial wars.

966
01:13:20,885 --> 01:13:22,011
Survival is a soldier's game.

967
01:13:22,512 --> 01:13:25,932
We both know this civilian fool
will lead us straight to hell.

968
01:13:26,391 --> 01:13:31,229
Robinson needs our help,
if he wants it or not.

969
01:13:31,729 --> 01:13:33,982
With minimal force,
we could take this ship...

970
01:13:34,399 --> 01:13:37,152
and assure them we shall
continue at your command.

971
01:13:38,403 --> 01:13:39,612
Of course.

972
01:13:40,155 --> 01:13:42,073
My God...

973
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:44,033
you're right.

974
01:13:44,492 --> 01:13:46,786
How could I have been so blind?

975
01:13:47,328 --> 01:13:52,542
I'll just run and get you a gun
so we can hijack the ship, OK?

976
01:13:54,669 --> 01:13:57,505
Sarcasm is the recourse
of the weak mind.

977
01:13:59,132 --> 01:14:00,884
I'm hiding the pain.

978
01:14:01,342 --> 01:14:02,552
Really.

979
01:14:06,055 --> 01:14:07,182
Lock.

980
01:14:11,352 --> 01:14:13,229
Your pain...

981
01:14:14,689 --> 01:14:16,274
has just begun.

982
01:14:21,654 --> 01:14:23,281
Starlight, star bright.

983
01:14:27,327 --> 01:14:29,996
A million strange stars,
and only one wish.

984
01:14:30,413 --> 01:14:31,873
I wish we were home.

985
01:14:34,709 --> 01:14:36,961
Never seen a sky look so alien.

986
01:14:37,462 --> 01:14:39,797
We really are lost,
aren't we?

987
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:48,765
When the first sailors
circled the globe...

988
01:14:49,265 --> 01:14:51,935
saw a brand-new sky...

989
01:14:52,435 --> 01:14:55,230
they thought they'd sailed
off the edge of the earth...

990
01:14:55,688 --> 01:14:57,273
but they were really
just around the corner.

991
01:14:59,984 --> 01:15:01,778
You're saying we should
just billow our sails...

992
01:15:02,278 --> 01:15:03,404
and let the wind take us home?

993
01:15:03,863 --> 01:15:05,198
Is that it?

994
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,743
Those sailors...

995
01:15:10,578 --> 01:15:13,915
found familiar shapes...

996
01:15:14,374 --> 01:15:16,250
in the stars...

997
01:15:16,793 --> 01:15:19,629
to make the sky seem
more friendly...

998
01:15:20,129 --> 01:15:21,005
and to help them
find their way home.

999
01:15:21,422 --> 01:15:24,217
That's how the constellations
were born.

1000
01:15:26,594 --> 01:15:28,805
Porky, the wise and mighty pig.

1001
01:15:46,572 --> 01:15:50,785
The great...
big-eared bunny Bugs.

1002
01:16:01,254 --> 01:16:04,298
The way you got us down here,
that was pretty flying.

1003
01:16:11,681 --> 01:16:13,641
My quarters or yours?

1004
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:15,393
Excuse me?

1005
01:16:15,893 --> 01:16:18,062
Don't play coy.

1006
01:16:18,521 --> 01:16:21,649
We're the only single people
of consenting age in the galaxy.

1007
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:24,360
How much more of a set-up
do you need?

1008
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:28,990
So you figure, why not dispense
with the pleasantries...

1009
01:16:29,449 --> 01:16:30,575
and get down to business?

1010
01:16:31,117 --> 01:16:34,245
You have a way with words.

1011
01:16:36,122 --> 01:16:37,874
Do you want to show me
how you handle the helm?

1012
01:16:42,754 --> 01:16:45,131
Right here on this console?

1013
01:16:49,635 --> 01:16:52,096
Right here would be fine.

1014
01:17:02,106 --> 01:17:04,734
Why don't you just hang on
to your joystick?

1015
01:17:14,410 --> 01:17:16,287
Excellent technique, Major.

1016
01:17:18,206 --> 01:17:19,373
Really.

1017
01:17:25,630 --> 01:17:27,298
Will was looking for you.

1018
01:17:30,092 --> 01:17:31,385
I sent him back to his room.

1019
01:17:31,844 --> 01:17:35,431
He's decided
he can rebuild the robot.

1020
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:39,727
He wants to stay up all night
and show me his designs.

1021
01:17:41,187 --> 01:17:43,064
Funny creatures, men.

1022
01:17:43,564 --> 01:17:46,359
Try so hard not to be
their fathers...

1023
01:17:46,817 --> 01:17:49,028
end up making the same mistakes.

1024
01:17:49,528 --> 01:17:54,116
We can't get off this planet,
let alone get back on course.

1025
01:17:54,659 --> 01:17:55,743
I don't have time.

1026
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:57,745
Just listen to him.

1027
01:17:58,162 --> 01:18:00,831
It doesn't matter what he says.
Just listen.

1028
01:18:01,249 --> 01:18:04,502
Sometimes--especially
in the eyes of their fathers--

1029
01:18:05,002 --> 01:18:07,255
little boys have to come first.

1030
01:18:07,755 --> 01:18:10,341
As soon as
we get back up into space...

1031
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:14,387
we'll spend a lot of time
together, I promise.

1032
01:18:34,365 --> 01:18:37,243
It's nice having your
whole family under one roof.

1033
01:18:39,578 --> 01:18:41,664
Even if we did have to go...

1034
01:18:42,081 --> 01:18:44,709
halfway across the galaxy
to manage it.

1035
01:18:57,930 --> 01:18:58,931
Good night, John.

1036
01:18:59,348 --> 01:19:00,433
Good night, Maureen.

1037
01:19:00,975 --> 01:19:02,768
Good night, Judy.

1038
01:19:03,269 --> 01:19:04,395
Good night, Will.

1039
01:19:05,396 --> 01:19:06,689
Good night, Penny.

1040
01:19:09,316 --> 01:19:11,652
You guys have got to be kidding.

1041
01:19:17,867 --> 01:19:19,827
Good morning, Will Robinson.

1042
01:19:20,327 --> 01:19:23,414
Solar panels are charged.

1043
01:19:40,723 --> 01:19:42,808
The radioactive material
we need for the core...

1044
01:19:43,267 --> 01:19:44,769
is in the centre of that bubble.

1045
01:19:45,227 --> 01:19:46,645
I was afraid of this.

1046
01:19:48,105 --> 01:19:50,608
OK, everybody,
let's get settled now.

1047
01:19:53,569 --> 01:19:55,988
I think this 'bubble'
out there...

1048
01:19:56,447 --> 01:19:59,325
is exactly the same thing
we passed through in space.

1049
01:19:59,867 --> 01:20:03,829
Both of them are opening
and closing doorways.

1050
01:20:04,288 --> 01:20:05,915
Doorways to where?

1051
01:20:06,373 --> 01:20:09,627
Doorways in...time.

1052
01:20:10,169 --> 01:20:10,920
You can't be serious.

1053
01:20:11,378 --> 01:20:13,172
Time travel is impossible.

1054
01:20:13,589 --> 01:20:15,549
It's not.
Just improbable.

1055
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:19,470
What if we crossed
into a time...

1056
01:20:19,929 --> 01:20:22,389
years after Earth
sent a rescue mission?

1057
01:20:22,806 --> 01:20:24,808
Perhaps the professor
hit his head when we landed.

1058
01:20:25,267 --> 01:20:26,018
Think about it.

1059
01:20:26,519 --> 01:20:29,146
The way the Proteus
seemed deserted for so long.

1060
01:20:29,647 --> 01:20:32,191
Your friend looking so old.

1061
01:20:32,691 --> 01:20:34,652
So if we walk
inside that bubble...

1062
01:20:35,110 --> 01:20:37,154
we could be walking
further into the future.

1063
01:20:37,655 --> 01:20:40,950
Dad, what if the doorways
aren't natural?

1064
01:20:41,450 --> 01:20:44,453
This kind of phenomenon could
only be produced naturally.

1065
01:20:44,912 --> 01:20:46,872
That bubble's
the kind of side effect...

1066
01:20:47,331 --> 01:20:49,625
I predicted my time machine
would do.

1067
01:20:50,084 --> 01:20:51,418
What if someone built a device--

1068
01:20:51,961 --> 01:20:54,880
Son...
I appreciate your input...

1069
01:20:55,297 --> 01:20:56,674
but now is not the time
for flights of fancy.

1070
01:20:57,174 --> 01:21:00,135
You never listen to me.

1071
01:21:01,428 --> 01:21:03,138
Not ever.

1072
01:21:11,772 --> 01:21:15,150
This time bubble could be
causing these earthquakes.

1073
01:21:15,651 --> 01:21:19,613
No telling how long before
this planet breaks up entirely.

1074
01:21:20,114 --> 01:21:21,949
The major and I
are going to locate...

1075
01:21:22,449 --> 01:21:24,201
the radioactive material
for the core.

1076
01:21:25,494 --> 01:21:27,621
We may have very little time.

1077
01:21:39,049 --> 01:21:40,217
I'm leaving now.

1078
01:21:40,759 --> 01:21:42,344
That's a surprise.

1079
01:21:47,808 --> 01:21:51,520
You're the most important thing
in the world to me.

1080
01:21:52,062 --> 01:21:54,982
One day, I hope you'll
be able to understand that.

1081
01:21:55,441 --> 01:22:00,070
What if...
one time you don't come home?

1082
01:22:03,907 --> 01:22:06,326
Whenever your grandfather
went on a mission...

1083
01:22:14,626 --> 01:22:18,047
he'd leave these with me
for safekeeping.

1084
01:22:19,423 --> 01:22:22,259
When he came home,
I would always be there...

1085
01:22:22,718 --> 01:22:25,637
waiting to give them back.

1086
01:22:28,432 --> 01:22:30,184
I'm coming back.

1087
01:22:32,102 --> 01:22:33,312
I promise.

1088
01:22:57,753 --> 01:22:59,004
Listen...

1089
01:23:01,215 --> 01:23:02,341
about last night...

1090
01:23:03,926 --> 01:23:06,261
Go on. You can do it.

1091
01:23:07,971 --> 01:23:08,722
I'm sorry.

1092
01:23:09,264 --> 01:23:11,850
See, that wasn't so difficult.

1093
01:23:12,392 --> 01:23:15,229
Like pulling steel needles
through my cheeks.

1094
01:23:15,729 --> 01:23:20,943
Then you understand
what saying this feels like.

1095
01:23:21,401 --> 01:23:23,445
Try to come back in one piece.

1096
01:23:28,116 --> 01:23:30,244
Listen, doc, I'm...

1097
01:23:31,787 --> 01:23:34,206
I'm thinking this is your basic
'kiss for luck' occasion.

1098
01:23:34,706 --> 01:23:35,999
Wouldn't you agree?

1099
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:37,960
Thinking.

1100
01:23:38,418 --> 01:23:40,337
It's not really
your strong suit, is it?

1101
01:23:45,175 --> 01:23:47,553
I've got a fix
on the radioactive material.

1102
01:24:01,358 --> 01:24:03,402
That was scientific.

1103
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:05,988
Scared?

1104
01:24:07,573 --> 01:24:09,074
There's an alloy
in this crater wall...

1105
01:24:09,575 --> 01:24:10,659
that's disabling the com-links.

1106
01:24:11,118 --> 01:24:13,328
You're not going to be able
to communicate with the ship.

1107
01:24:18,417 --> 01:24:20,377
Come home to me, Professor.

1108
01:24:22,629 --> 01:24:24,339
I love you, wife.

1109
01:24:30,137 --> 01:24:31,430
Come here, squirt.

1110
01:24:43,692 --> 01:24:46,737
Nice girl.
Pretty girl. Nice.

1111
01:25:17,601 --> 01:25:19,853
It's OK.
You're still in one piece.

1112
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:26,568
Come on.

1113
01:25:31,031 --> 01:25:34,659
Can you hear me, Robot?
Hello?

1114
01:25:35,577 --> 01:25:36,328
Systems error!

1115
01:25:36,787 --> 01:25:38,622
Robot unable to locate
motor controls!

1116
01:25:39,122 --> 01:25:39,831
Unable to--

1117
01:25:40,332 --> 01:25:41,083
Calm down.

1118
01:25:41,541 --> 01:25:43,919
What is happening to me?

1119
01:25:44,377 --> 01:25:48,006
I didn't have enough time
to finish the download.

1120
01:25:48,465 --> 01:25:49,966
Warning!
Penny, give it back!

1121
01:25:50,425 --> 01:25:52,385
My circuits are unbalanced.

1122
01:25:52,886 --> 01:25:54,971
So I had to finish you off
with another personality.

1123
01:25:55,430 --> 01:25:57,432
I put my mind inside of yours.

1124
01:26:02,896 --> 01:26:05,482
That explains
this warm fuzzy feeling...

1125
01:26:05,899 --> 01:26:07,818
when I think about baseball.

1126
01:26:08,276 --> 01:26:09,861
Strike! You're out!

1127
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:11,613
But this does not compute.

1128
01:26:12,072 --> 01:26:12,823
What?

1129
01:26:13,281 --> 01:26:15,909
Robot tried to destroy
the Robinson family.

1130
01:26:16,368 --> 01:26:18,995
Why did Will Robinson
save Robot's personality?

1131
01:26:19,454 --> 01:26:22,958
I guess sometimes friendship
means listening to your heart...

1132
01:26:23,458 --> 01:26:24,167
not your head.

1133
01:26:24,626 --> 01:26:26,795
Put that in your memory bank.

1134
01:26:28,630 --> 01:26:30,632
Don't worry.

1135
01:26:32,926 --> 01:26:34,386
I'm gonna build you a new body.

1136
01:26:36,096 --> 01:26:38,640
Mom always said I should
try to make new friends.

1137
01:26:47,190 --> 01:26:49,025
I need a micro sealer.

1138
01:26:49,526 --> 01:26:50,861
I got it.

1139
01:26:57,909 --> 01:26:59,327
After much deliberation...

1140
01:26:59,828 --> 01:27:01,746
the space captive
has finally decided...

1141
01:27:02,205 --> 01:27:05,375
to accept her new role
as a member of the crew.

1142
01:27:05,875 --> 01:27:09,004
The Robinsons, after all,
can obviously use her help.

1143
01:27:11,631 --> 01:27:12,924
Blarp, come back here.

1144
01:27:13,425 --> 01:27:15,885
Theoretically,
this future would be fixed...

1145
01:27:16,344 --> 01:27:20,473
unchanged by what we do
or did in the past--

1146
01:27:20,974 --> 01:27:23,184
Why don't you give
the old egghead a rest?

1147
01:27:23,685 --> 01:27:27,939
Out here we got two moons,
a crater the size of Miami...

1148
01:27:28,356 --> 01:27:31,192
and that would be
one great climb.

1149
01:27:31,651 --> 01:27:33,570
My father would have liked you.

1150
01:27:38,992 --> 01:27:40,201
What's that?

1151
01:27:51,087 --> 01:27:52,547
This metal's decades old.

1152
01:27:53,006 --> 01:27:55,300
What kind of a nightmare
is this?

1153
01:27:57,135 --> 01:27:57,886
Where the hell are we?

1154
01:27:58,386 --> 01:28:00,513
The question is,
when the hell are we?

1155
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:25,580
I will tell you a joke.

1156
01:28:26,122 --> 01:28:28,249
Why did the robot
cross the road?

1157
01:28:28,708 --> 01:28:31,503
Because he was carbon-bonded
to the chicken.

1158
01:28:31,961 --> 01:28:33,630
We have a lot of work to do.

1159
01:28:37,425 --> 01:28:39,385
That sounds like old Morse code.

1160
01:28:39,886 --> 01:28:40,929
What does it say?

1161
01:28:41,429 --> 01:28:43,681
'Danger,
Will Robinson, danger.'

1162
01:29:08,581 --> 01:29:10,583
William. Come in.

1163
01:29:12,377 --> 01:29:13,586
Unlock.

1164
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:18,758
You said someone was in danger.

1165
01:29:19,259 --> 01:29:20,677
We all are.

1166
01:29:21,136 --> 01:29:22,846
You are wise to arm yourself.

1167
01:29:23,304 --> 01:29:25,849
This gun is set to fire
for me only...

1168
01:29:26,307 --> 01:29:29,310
so don't try anything funny.
Lock.

1169
01:29:32,605 --> 01:29:36,526
You misjudge me.
I only want to help you.

1170
01:29:37,026 --> 01:29:39,320
Help us?
You tried to kill us.

1171
01:29:39,737 --> 01:29:41,865
But now our fates
are intertwined.

1172
01:29:42,407 --> 01:29:45,577
If your father
and that idiot West fail...

1173
01:29:46,035 --> 01:29:48,496
I have no chance
of getting home.

1174
01:29:48,955 --> 01:29:52,876
It's in my best interests
that they succeed...

1175
01:29:53,334 --> 01:29:56,880
and I always follow
my best interests.

1176
01:29:59,549 --> 01:30:06,848
What monsters roam
these alien wilds?

1177
01:30:07,307 --> 01:30:09,475
They're fools!

1178
01:30:09,976 --> 01:30:13,730
To set off blindly
across this savage land.

1179
01:30:16,065 --> 01:30:17,650
Much as I hate to admit it...

1180
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:22,113
it will be much harder
without them.

1181
01:30:22,488 --> 01:30:24,282
What are you talking about?

1182
01:30:24,741 --> 01:30:27,910
They'll be back.
They'll be OK.

1183
01:30:30,371 --> 01:30:31,456
Will they?

1184
01:30:34,834 --> 01:30:36,336
Someone should go after them.

1185
01:30:36,794 --> 01:30:37,503
Unlock.

1186
01:30:37,962 --> 01:30:39,380
I forbid it. You're a boy.

1187
01:30:39,839 --> 01:30:41,049
A clever one,
but a child nonetheless.

1188
01:30:41,549 --> 01:30:43,885
This planet
is likely full of predators.

1189
01:30:44,344 --> 01:30:48,514
Even if you found them,
what if they're hurt? Ravaged?

1190
01:30:53,019 --> 01:30:54,187
Dying?

1191
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:59,025
What good could you do?

1192
01:31:03,112 --> 01:31:06,282
You can help them.
You're a doctor.

1193
01:31:13,456 --> 01:31:15,416
I'm a doctor.

1194
01:31:18,044 --> 01:31:19,253
We made it.

1195
01:31:19,253 --> 01:31:21,381
Mom didn't see us.

1196
01:31:21,839 --> 01:31:24,008
That's fantastic.

1197
01:31:26,469 --> 01:31:29,680
I told you we could get
into the bubble this way.

1198
01:31:35,269 --> 01:31:36,437
The bubble's growing!

1199
01:31:40,733 --> 01:31:43,945
Run, child!

1200
01:32:00,253 --> 01:32:02,004
Cool.

1201
01:32:02,421 --> 01:32:04,215
Wait!

1202
01:32:10,429 --> 01:32:13,933
Come on.
We can always go back.

1203
01:32:14,433 --> 01:32:16,394
It's just like stepping
between two rooms.

1204
01:32:16,894 --> 01:32:18,771
I can barely contain my glee.

1205
01:32:20,148 --> 01:32:23,442
Dad's signal is...
this way.

1206
01:32:27,113 --> 01:32:28,823
I loathe children.

1207
01:32:49,385 --> 01:32:51,888
Billy...kissing...

1208
01:32:52,346 --> 01:32:57,560
hot wings, orchids, corn.

1209
01:32:58,978 --> 01:33:05,860
Waves...Billy...
popcorn with...kissing...

1210
01:33:06,319 --> 01:33:09,864
What did you find?

1211
01:33:10,323 --> 01:33:12,909
Come on.
No time to dawdle.

1212
01:33:13,367 --> 01:33:16,412
Let's move along.

1213
01:33:18,122 --> 01:33:20,750
Follow your father's signal.

1214
01:33:22,209 --> 01:33:23,377
Come on.

1215
01:33:52,490 --> 01:33:57,411
All things really do come
to he who waits.

1216
01:34:07,296 --> 01:34:07,963
What is this place?

1217
01:34:08,464 --> 01:34:10,800
The shock must have
scrambled your brain.

1218
01:34:11,342 --> 01:34:13,344
Take a look around.

1219
01:34:18,099 --> 01:34:20,142
Don't you recognize this spot?

1220
01:34:24,563 --> 01:34:26,649
You're home.

1221
01:34:32,530 --> 01:34:33,406
This can't be.

1222
01:34:33,864 --> 01:34:36,325
What have you done to the ship?

1223
01:34:37,910 --> 01:34:39,578
Where is my family?

1224
01:34:40,996 --> 01:34:44,333
What chance do you think
your family had without you?

1225
01:34:44,875 --> 01:34:48,212
A few spiders survived
the destruction of the Proteus.

1226
01:34:48,671 --> 01:34:51,507
They reached this planet and...

1227
01:34:56,470 --> 01:34:59,265
I can still hear
the women scream.

1228
01:35:03,477 --> 01:35:04,270
Who are you?

1229
01:35:04,728 --> 01:35:06,230
You don't recognize me?

1230
01:35:14,196 --> 01:35:16,782
I'm your son Will.

1231
01:35:21,495 --> 01:35:23,122
Dad's signal
is just over this ridge.

1232
01:35:23,664 --> 01:35:26,667
Be still, my foolish heart.

1233
01:35:27,084 --> 01:35:28,711
Shit.

1234
01:35:29,128 --> 01:35:32,256
A boy of your intelligence
should never swear.

1235
01:35:35,426 --> 01:35:37,136
Shit.

1236
01:35:40,848 --> 01:35:42,224
Indeed.

1237
01:35:46,604 --> 01:35:48,105
Look, Father...

1238
01:35:48,564 --> 01:35:53,777
what my flights of fancy
have wrought.

1239
01:35:55,196 --> 01:35:59,533
I used your hyper engine
to build my time machine.

1240
01:36:01,744 --> 01:36:03,370
OK, Robot, put him down.

1241
01:36:03,829 --> 01:36:05,372
Affirmative.

1242
01:36:11,503 --> 01:36:12,546
Where are we?

1243
01:36:12,963 --> 01:36:15,466
I think the Jupiter 2,
but in a different future.

1244
01:36:15,883 --> 01:36:17,426
Father?

1245
01:36:17,885 --> 01:36:18,802
Once this core material...

1246
01:36:19,261 --> 01:36:21,972
is fully introduced
into the control console...

1247
01:36:22,473 --> 01:36:24,350
Core material.

1248
01:36:24,850 --> 01:36:27,227
If we could get that
back to our Jupiter...

1249
01:36:27,728 --> 01:36:32,983
I will open a doorway
stable enough...

1250
01:36:33,484 --> 01:36:38,030
for one person to take
one trip through time...

1251
01:36:38,530 --> 01:36:40,491
and space as well.

1252
01:36:40,991 --> 01:36:44,078
Commence proto-generation.

1253
01:36:45,412 --> 01:36:47,164
Cool, huh?

1254
01:36:47,623 --> 01:36:51,293
Today, I will change history.

1255
01:36:53,337 --> 01:36:56,340
I'm gonna go back to that day
you dragged us into space.

1256
01:36:57,967 --> 01:37:00,344
I'll stop the ship
from taking off.

1257
01:37:03,764 --> 01:37:05,474
I'll save the family.

1258
01:37:05,891 --> 01:37:08,769
Earth, October 1, 2058.

1259
01:37:09,228 --> 01:37:10,521
Target lock confirmed.

1260
01:37:10,979 --> 01:37:11,689
Excellent.

1261
01:37:12,147 --> 01:37:13,524
Son...

1262
01:37:14,858 --> 01:37:16,151
Look around.

1263
01:37:17,319 --> 01:37:20,739
The force of your time machine
is ripping this planet apart.

1264
01:37:21,198 --> 01:37:23,117
These violent distortions
in time...

1265
01:37:23,617 --> 01:37:25,285
are being caused
by your experiment.

1266
01:37:25,786 --> 01:37:28,914
What if it has the same effect
on Earth?

1267
01:37:29,415 --> 01:37:30,958
What if, in getting home...

1268
01:37:31,417 --> 01:37:33,377
you destroy Earth
in the process?

1269
01:37:40,884 --> 01:37:42,553
I know you mean well.

1270
01:37:44,138 --> 01:37:45,681
I'm going home.

1271
01:37:46,223 --> 01:37:47,474
I'm going to save the family.

1272
01:37:47,933 --> 01:37:51,145
You've got to listen to me.
I'm your father!

1273
01:37:52,396 --> 01:37:54,022
My father?

1274
01:37:56,150 --> 01:37:58,444
Let me tell you about my father.

1275
01:37:58,902 --> 01:38:01,738
I'll never forget
that morning 20 years ago.

1276
01:38:02,197 --> 01:38:04,241
What was it you said?

1277
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:06,869
'I'm coming back.
I promise.'

1278
01:38:07,411 --> 01:38:09,580
You promised...
and you never came home.

1279
01:38:10,038 --> 01:38:13,834
My father's not
coming to the rescue.

1280
01:38:38,358 --> 01:38:39,985
What do you think you're doing,
young man?

1281
01:38:40,444 --> 01:38:42,237
Let me tell you about life.

1282
01:38:42,696 --> 01:38:44,281
Around every corner,
monsters wait.

1283
01:38:44,740 --> 01:38:45,908
I know. I am one.

1284
01:38:46,366 --> 01:38:49,328
We monsters have no fear
in devouring little boys.

1285
01:38:49,786 --> 01:38:51,914
To survive, you must be
fully prepared to kill.

1286
01:38:52,414 --> 01:38:53,832
I can do it.

1287
01:38:54,333 --> 01:38:55,459
Can you?

1288
01:38:58,337 --> 01:39:00,255
Listen to me, my child...

1289
01:39:00,714 --> 01:39:02,507
I've crossed this world
with you...

1290
01:39:02,925 --> 01:39:06,720
risked my life,
but I would not throw it away.

1291
01:39:07,179 --> 01:39:10,057
Who knows what dangers
lie ahead?

1292
01:39:11,433 --> 01:39:12,768
You can't protect us.

1293
01:39:14,394 --> 01:39:15,604
I can.

1294
01:39:17,272 --> 01:39:18,440
I will.

1295
01:39:20,442 --> 01:39:22,486
Gimme the gun.

1296
01:39:22,986 --> 01:39:24,529
Enable gun for all users.

1297
01:39:24,988 --> 01:39:26,657
Voiceprint confirmed.

1298
01:39:28,408 --> 01:39:31,787
A brief lesson in survival
on this world or any other--

1299
01:39:32,246 --> 01:39:35,874
never trust anyone.
Especially me.

1300
01:39:40,337 --> 01:39:42,881
It's almost time.
I hope it works.

1301
01:39:43,340 --> 01:39:44,508
Never fear...

1302
01:39:45,676 --> 01:39:46,843
Smith is here.

1303
01:39:48,095 --> 01:39:49,888
Don't move,
Professor Robinson...

1304
01:39:50,430 --> 01:39:53,892
or this peculiar family reunion
will be tragically brief.

1305
01:39:54,434 --> 01:39:55,936
I'll ask you
to step away from that.

1306
01:39:56,478 --> 01:39:58,021
It's a time machine,
you idiot.

1307
01:39:58,563 --> 01:40:01,024
I had hoped to take over
the ship with this.

1308
01:40:01,525 --> 01:40:04,277
One of life's little ironies.

1309
01:40:04,778 --> 01:40:07,781
Let's try this dance again.

1310
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:10,283
You are the puppet,
I am the puppeteer.

1311
01:40:10,784 --> 01:40:14,162
Do try to get it right
this time.

1312
01:40:14,663 --> 01:40:17,791
Robot, you will respond
to my voice alone.

1313
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:19,001
Affirmative.

1314
01:40:19,501 --> 01:40:21,545
We need electric disrupters.

1315
01:40:25,090 --> 01:40:27,134
That's good, gargantuan.

1316
01:40:29,428 --> 01:40:32,222
You did it.
Just like I imagined.

1317
01:40:32,681 --> 01:40:34,224
You linked
the dimensional sifter...

1318
01:40:34,641 --> 01:40:35,809
to the navigational array.

1319
01:40:36,309 --> 01:40:38,895
That's how it can be in
the same place at the same time.

1320
01:40:39,396 --> 01:40:43,984
But the spatial delivery system,
the targeting laser...

1321
01:40:44,484 --> 01:40:45,485
I never thought of those.

1322
01:40:45,944 --> 01:40:49,865
The future is never what
it seems like when you're 10.

1323
01:40:50,365 --> 01:40:53,076
Say good-bye to your past!

1324
01:40:53,577 --> 01:40:55,787
Your future lies with me.

1325
01:40:56,288 --> 01:40:58,248
I'm going home in your place.

1326
01:41:01,293 --> 01:41:03,086
What are you grinning at?

1327
01:41:05,338 --> 01:41:09,926
Look around you...
at this hostile world.

1328
01:41:10,427 --> 01:41:13,805
Do you think a boy
could have survived all alone?

1329
01:41:14,973 --> 01:41:17,517
Never fear...
Smith is here.

1330
01:41:19,269 --> 01:41:20,479
It's Dr Smith.

1331
01:41:21,021 --> 01:41:22,230
Hello.

1332
01:41:22,689 --> 01:41:26,193
How nice to see me again
after all these years.

1333
01:41:26,610 --> 01:41:28,528
Confused?
Have I changed?

1334
01:41:29,029 --> 01:41:32,491
The spider's sting had some
unexpected side effects.

1335
01:41:32,949 --> 01:41:35,494
My unique gifts
gave me an advantage...

1336
01:41:35,952 --> 01:41:37,954
in this quarrelsome world.

1337
01:41:38,413 --> 01:41:40,624
After the women were savaged...

1338
01:41:41,124 --> 01:41:45,754
I became the father
Will never had.

1339
01:41:46,296 --> 01:41:51,968
Two decades of agony taught me
the error of my ways.

1340
01:41:52,511 --> 01:41:57,599
But you, your crude ambition
fills me with self-loathing.

1341
01:41:58,016 --> 01:42:01,019
You see,
I have looked within me...

1342
01:42:01,561 --> 01:42:03,813
and what I see is you!

1343
01:42:12,072 --> 01:42:14,908
I never liked me anyway.

1344
01:42:15,367 --> 01:42:17,577
Robot, kill them all.

1345
01:42:18,662 --> 01:42:19,621
Wait.

1346
01:42:20,121 --> 01:42:22,332
Dr Smith, please.

1347
01:42:25,001 --> 01:42:26,836
Don't.

1348
01:42:33,218 --> 01:42:34,970
Very well.

1349
01:42:35,428 --> 01:42:37,973
Robot, take them inside
and keep them there.

1350
01:42:38,473 --> 01:42:41,726
If they move...
then kill them.

1351
01:42:42,227 --> 01:42:45,272
Proceed or be destroyed.

1352
01:43:08,253 --> 01:43:09,421
Nothing works.

1353
01:43:11,881 --> 01:43:13,758
I'll draw his fire,
you grab Will and get out.

1354
01:43:14,217 --> 01:43:15,385
Halt!

1355
01:43:16,636 --> 01:43:18,221
Stop!

1356
01:43:19,723 --> 01:43:21,516
Do you remember me?

1357
01:43:22,058 --> 01:43:25,353
Do you remember what I
taught you about friendship?

1358
01:43:28,857 --> 01:43:31,860
I need you to help us now,
because we're friends.

1359
01:43:32,402 --> 01:43:34,738
Logic error.
Friendship does not compute.

1360
01:43:35,238 --> 01:43:37,991
Forget logic.
Act with your heart.

1361
01:43:38,533 --> 01:43:41,119
Robot has no heart.

1362
01:43:41,619 --> 01:43:43,788
Robot is powered by
a fusion pulse generator.

1363
01:43:44,247 --> 01:43:45,540
Every living thing has a heart.

1364
01:43:45,999 --> 01:43:48,918
My programming has been modified
to remove all emotion.

1365
01:43:49,377 --> 01:43:51,212
Any attempts to override
command protocols...

1366
01:43:51,713 --> 01:43:53,631
may result infusing
my neural net.

1367
01:43:57,802 --> 01:43:58,720
Please, Robot?

1368
01:43:59,137 --> 01:44:01,014
If you don't let us go,
we're all gonna die.

1369
01:44:01,514 --> 01:44:04,350
I'm asking you now,
will you help us?

1370
01:44:06,060 --> 01:44:07,395
Will you be my friend?

1371
01:44:11,608 --> 01:44:14,027
Robot attempting
to deactivate control bolt.

1372
01:44:14,444 --> 01:44:16,780
-Commands overridden!
-Do it!

1373
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:19,282
Destroy Robinson family!

1374
01:44:19,699 --> 01:44:21,409
Destroy!

1375
01:44:31,878 --> 01:44:33,129
You did it.

1376
01:44:35,548 --> 01:44:37,258
Robot will save Will Robinson.

1377
01:44:37,717 --> 01:44:40,220
Robot will save his friend.

1378
01:44:44,140 --> 01:44:46,392
Where are they?

1379
01:44:59,906 --> 01:45:01,032
Wait here.

1380
01:45:02,450 --> 01:45:03,618
Without that core...

1381
01:45:04,118 --> 01:45:05,954
I can't promise
we'll get off this rock.

1382
01:45:06,412 --> 01:45:08,623
See if you can make it
back to our Jupiter.

1383
01:45:09,123 --> 01:45:10,208
I'll get the core material
and meet you there.

1384
01:45:10,667 --> 01:45:12,252
We don't have the trackers
to find our way back.

1385
01:45:12,752 --> 01:45:14,921
The family needs their father.

1386
01:45:15,421 --> 01:45:16,965
The crew needs their pilot.

1387
01:45:17,423 --> 01:45:20,468
I can't fly the ship
as well as you can.

1388
01:45:20,969 --> 01:45:23,263
You're their best chance
to survive.

1389
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:25,348
Listen to me.

1390
01:45:25,765 --> 01:45:27,934
I know you never wanted
to take this job.

1391
01:45:28,476 --> 01:45:31,938
I think you're going to turn out
to be a grade-A baby-sitter.

1392
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:36,025
So...
the camper's all yours now.

1393
01:45:36,567 --> 01:45:37,735
Take care of them.

1394
01:45:38,945 --> 01:45:40,029
Good luck.

1395
01:45:40,571 --> 01:45:41,781
-Dad!
-Professor!

1396
01:45:45,118 --> 01:45:48,246
Remember the space spiders
in the Proteus?

1397
01:45:52,208 --> 01:45:54,877
They're not going to be able
to get back.

1398
01:45:57,297 --> 01:45:58,673
Enable all missiles.

1399
01:46:00,717 --> 01:46:01,884
But the warheads don't work.

1400
01:46:02,343 --> 01:46:03,469
Just do it.

1401
01:46:05,847 --> 01:46:07,390
Look!

1402
01:46:12,478 --> 01:46:14,981
Damn, he's still breathing.

1403
01:46:18,359 --> 01:46:19,444
Fire in the hole.

1404
01:46:26,075 --> 01:46:29,328
So these sailors,
they drew shapes in the sky...

1405
01:46:31,873 --> 01:46:34,333
Look! It's a flare!

1406
01:46:36,294 --> 01:46:37,795
...to help them
find their way home.

1407
01:46:38,254 --> 01:46:39,756
Danger, Will Robinson!

1408
01:46:55,521 --> 01:46:58,566
Climb on! Hurry!

1409
01:47:08,201 --> 01:47:10,745
Field dampeners on-line.

1410
01:47:11,287 --> 01:47:13,456
Portal compression commenced.

1411
01:47:22,882 --> 01:47:27,011
Tell me again, old monster,
how did the girls die?

1412
01:47:27,512 --> 01:47:30,765
We've been over this before,
son.

1413
01:47:34,268 --> 01:47:35,853
In all the years since...

1414
01:47:38,481 --> 01:47:41,067
the spiders
have never resurfaced.

1415
01:47:43,986 --> 01:47:44,987
Why?

1416
01:47:45,404 --> 01:47:50,409
Let's forget the past.

1417
01:47:54,247 --> 01:47:58,000
Portal aperture reduction, 50%.

1418
01:48:03,214 --> 01:48:05,758
Careful, child!
The plasma around the portal...

1419
01:48:06,259 --> 01:48:08,427
will rip a man into pieces!

1420
01:48:14,016 --> 01:48:18,062
Haven't you made the doorway...
too small?

1421
01:48:18,563 --> 01:48:19,855
Not for me.

1422
01:48:21,482 --> 01:48:23,859
But then I'm not going, am l?

1423
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:26,904
Spiders didn't kill the girls.

1424
01:48:28,698 --> 01:48:29,574
It was you.

1425
01:48:29,991 --> 01:48:32,868
I just never let myself see it.

1426
01:48:33,327 --> 01:48:36,205
You kept me alive
because you needed me.

1427
01:48:36,747 --> 01:48:39,375
Because I could
build this for you.

1428
01:48:40,626 --> 01:48:42,503
Poor boy.

1429
01:48:43,045 --> 01:48:47,133
Did you really think
I would let you go home?

1430
01:48:47,592 --> 01:48:52,513
Let all that I have become
vanish?

1431
01:48:53,014 --> 01:48:55,516
Look at me!
I am no mere man!

1432
01:48:56,017 --> 01:48:56,851
l...am...a...god!

1433
01:49:01,105 --> 01:49:03,232
Within these egg sacs
grow the seeds...

1434
01:49:03,649 --> 01:49:05,943
of a master race of spiders.

1435
01:49:06,444 --> 01:49:09,030
We shall descend upon
helpless Earth...

1436
01:49:09,530 --> 01:49:10,865
an entire planet to rule!

1437
01:49:11,407 --> 01:49:14,452
An entire planet
on which to feed!

1438
01:49:16,495 --> 01:49:18,956
Time to die...son.

1439
01:49:19,498 --> 01:49:20,958
I'm not your son.

1440
01:49:21,417 --> 01:49:23,878
Good-bye.

1441
01:49:35,973 --> 01:49:37,224
My father once said...

1442
01:49:38,851 --> 01:49:41,312
'Evil always finds
its true form.'

1443
01:49:42,188 --> 01:49:44,732
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

1444
01:49:45,191 --> 01:49:47,735
You were right.
I couldn't kill the man...

1445
01:49:49,153 --> 01:49:50,654
but I can kill the monster!

1446
01:49:54,617 --> 01:49:57,953
Spare me
the fury of the righteous.

1447
01:49:58,662 --> 01:50:03,751
I think there's time for a snack
before my trip.

1448
01:50:10,758 --> 01:50:12,259
The pain.

1449
01:50:14,261 --> 01:50:16,180
You ain't seen nothing yet.

1450
01:50:24,355 --> 01:50:25,898
Remember the Proteus?

1451
01:50:26,398 --> 01:50:28,400
These monsters
eat their wounded.

1452
01:50:42,039 --> 01:50:45,251
Take all the time you want
to die!

1453
01:51:17,658 --> 01:51:20,870
Wake up, son!

1454
01:51:21,287 --> 01:51:22,454
Dad?

1455
01:51:29,420 --> 01:51:32,423
Core material insertion
complete.

1456
01:51:34,425 --> 01:51:37,845
All table run--2058.

1457
01:51:38,345 --> 01:51:39,096
Mission control.

1458
01:51:39,555 --> 01:51:42,558
You could've taken the core
and left before it was too late.

1459
01:51:43,058 --> 01:51:45,561
I couldn't let you fall.

1460
01:51:46,061 --> 01:51:47,354
You're my boy.

1461
01:51:55,487 --> 01:51:57,364
Mom! It's them.

1462
01:52:03,662 --> 01:52:05,164
Hi, Mom!

1463
01:52:07,291 --> 01:52:08,000
You all right?

1464
01:52:08,542 --> 01:52:09,251
You're not as dumb as you look.

1465
01:52:09,752 --> 01:52:11,378
I'm gonna get your name
tattooed right here.

1466
01:52:13,255 --> 01:52:14,965
Greetings.

1467
01:52:15,424 --> 01:52:16,800
Where's John?

1468
01:52:19,720 --> 01:52:20,971
The bubble closed behind us.

1469
01:52:21,430 --> 01:52:24,308
It was his only way back.

1470
01:52:24,808 --> 01:52:26,769
I'm sorry.

1471
01:52:28,354 --> 01:52:31,398
We've already begun
the pre-flight countdown.

1472
01:52:31,899 --> 01:52:34,360
I'm going to save
as many lives as I can.

1473
01:52:46,121 --> 01:52:48,457
I kept hoping somehow
he'd make it back.

1474
01:52:55,089 --> 01:52:56,465
Let's go, Major.

1475
01:52:57,841 --> 01:52:59,259
Good-bye, my love.

1476
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:02,262
Engaging primary thrusters now.

1477
01:53:39,383 --> 01:53:42,010
Look. He made it.

1478
01:53:54,648 --> 01:53:55,399
Go.

1479
01:54:04,616 --> 01:54:05,742
We're not getting any altitude.

1480
01:54:06,201 --> 01:54:08,871
We don't have enough power.

1481
01:54:18,130 --> 01:54:19,381
I'm sorry.

1482
01:54:37,316 --> 01:54:39,276
I couldn't save them.

1483
01:54:44,281 --> 01:54:46,950
So many years ago.

1484
01:54:47,409 --> 01:54:48,910
I can still feel it--

1485
01:54:49,453 --> 01:54:51,163
our sun...

1486
01:54:52,456 --> 01:54:53,790
our Earth.

1487
01:54:55,959 --> 01:54:59,921
It's all I thought about--
going home.

1488
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:05,469
A long time ago,
you told a small boy...

1489
01:55:05,969 --> 01:55:09,890
that one day he'd understand
how much his father loved him.

1490
01:55:12,142 --> 01:55:15,646
I could never see
how much you cared...

1491
01:55:18,523 --> 01:55:19,900
until now.

1492
01:55:20,359 --> 01:55:21,109
Come.

1493
01:55:21,568 --> 01:55:23,695
Let's go.

1494
01:55:26,490 --> 01:55:28,950
I kept hoping he'd make it back.

1495
01:55:29,409 --> 01:55:31,286
Good-bye, my love.

1496
01:55:34,539 --> 01:55:35,707
Look!

1497
01:55:37,417 --> 01:55:40,379
Don't make me wait another
lifetime to know how you feel.

1498
01:55:49,971 --> 01:55:51,014
Dad!

1499
01:55:56,978 --> 01:56:00,982
Dad, it worked!

1500
01:56:02,317 --> 01:56:03,068
Come with us!

1501
01:56:03,527 --> 01:56:05,237
I can't.

1502
01:56:05,737 --> 01:56:09,825
Only enough power for
one person, one trip, remember?

1503
01:56:15,455 --> 01:56:17,165
It's good to see you again, Mom.

1504
01:56:17,624 --> 01:56:19,835
It's good to see you all.

1505
01:56:20,293 --> 01:56:22,337
Take care of them, Will.

1506
01:56:29,594 --> 01:56:31,847
Don't forget me.

1507
01:56:32,681 --> 01:56:35,183
He sacrificed everything
for his family.

1508
01:56:42,816 --> 01:56:44,276
I'm glad you came back.

1509
01:56:46,069 --> 01:56:48,697
I just want you to know
I love you.

1510
01:56:50,282 --> 01:56:52,075
I love you very much.

1511
01:57:00,792 --> 01:57:03,170
The planet
is breaking up around us.

1512
01:57:09,718 --> 01:57:12,387
We're doomed!

1513
01:57:17,142 --> 01:57:18,101
Boy, that felt good.

1514
01:57:18,518 --> 01:57:20,312
Get us airborne.

1515
01:57:22,314 --> 01:57:25,066
I'm going to try
to reach escape velocity.

1516
01:57:25,567 --> 01:57:26,902
We don't have the core material.

1517
01:57:27,444 --> 01:57:28,570
The gravity wells
will pull us back down.

1518
01:57:29,029 --> 01:57:30,155
We might be able to--

1519
01:57:30,655 --> 01:57:33,408
We won't make it. I know.

1520
01:57:34,743 --> 01:57:35,994
We have to go...

1521
01:57:38,246 --> 01:57:39,706
down--

1522
01:57:40,165 --> 01:57:42,334
through the planet
as she's breaking up.

1523
01:57:42,792 --> 01:57:45,921
We can use
the planet's gravity...

1524
01:57:46,421 --> 01:57:47,130
What?

1525
01:57:47,672 --> 01:57:50,508
to throw us out the other side
and back into space.

1526
01:57:50,967 --> 01:57:51,927
That's insane.

1527
01:57:52,427 --> 01:57:54,262
I don't have time to argue.

1528
01:57:58,892 --> 01:58:00,477
That's a direct order.

1529
01:58:03,104 --> 01:58:04,564
Yes, sir, Commander.

1530
01:58:06,149 --> 01:58:08,652
This should be interesting.

1531
01:58:40,558 --> 01:58:41,351
I see it.

1532
01:58:41,851 --> 01:58:42,977
Full burn.

1533
01:58:53,321 --> 01:58:54,030
Stop!

1534
01:58:54,489 --> 01:58:55,281
-Right!
-Left!

1535
01:58:55,782 --> 01:58:56,950
Let me drive.

1536
01:59:05,041 --> 01:59:07,836
All right, everybody,
hold your noses.

1537
01:59:29,566 --> 01:59:31,776
Rock and roll.

1538
02:00:01,764 --> 02:00:04,225
Amazing.

1539
02:00:11,191 --> 02:00:12,901
Nice work, flyboy.

1540
02:00:13,443 --> 02:00:15,486
I earn that kiss yet?

1541
02:00:15,945 --> 02:00:17,322
You earn this.

1542
02:00:24,120 --> 02:00:25,622
This one's on credit.

1543
02:00:35,381 --> 02:00:36,925
Cold fish, huh?

1544
02:00:56,235 --> 02:00:58,571
There you are. Come here.

1545
02:00:59,614 --> 02:01:03,076
Where have you been,
you little creep?

1546
02:01:03,534 --> 02:01:05,161
-Little creep?
-Oh, great.

1547
02:01:05,620 --> 02:01:06,704
Warning, Major West.

1548
02:01:07,205 --> 02:01:10,083
My sensors indicate
we have a problem.

1549
02:01:14,379 --> 02:01:16,839
The planet's gravity field
is collapsing.

1550
02:01:17,340 --> 02:01:18,049
We'll be sucked in.

1551
02:01:18,549 --> 02:01:19,801
No way to get clear in time.

1552
02:01:20,301 --> 02:01:21,719
The hyperdrive.

1553
02:01:22,220 --> 02:01:24,222
I'm accessing
the Proteus star maps.

1554
02:01:24,722 --> 02:01:25,765
Here we go again.

1555
02:01:26,265 --> 02:01:28,601
Targeting Alpha Prime...
I hope.

1556
02:01:30,853 --> 02:01:32,146
Initiate...now.
