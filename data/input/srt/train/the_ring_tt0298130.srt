1
00:00:28,743 --> 00:00:30,677
I hate television.

2
00:00:30,712 --> 00:00:32,009
Gives me headaches.

3
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:33,104
...makes your

4
00:00:33,147 --> 00:00:34,011
color-treated hair...

5
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,242
You know, I heard there's

6
00:00:35,283 --> 00:00:37,877
so many magnetic waves traveling
through the air

7
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:41,286
because of TV and telephones,
that we're losing, like

8
00:00:41,322 --> 00:00:44,416
ten times as many brain cells
as we're supposed to.

9
00:00:44,459 --> 00:00:47,223
Like, all the molecules
in our heads are all unstable.

10
00:00:47,261 --> 00:00:48,819
All the companies know
about it

11
00:00:48,863 --> 00:00:50,660
but they're not
doing anything about it.

12
00:00:50,698 --> 00:00:53,292
It's, like, a big conspiracy.

13
00:00:53,368 --> 00:00:55,302
You can pick something.

14
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,860
I don't care.

15
00:00:56,904 --> 00:00:58,804
Say hello to luscious,
full bod...

16
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:02,441
You have any idea
how many electro-rays

17
00:01:02,477 --> 00:01:05,446
are traveling
through our head every second?

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,447
I got a better one.

19
00:01:07,148 --> 00:01:08,672
Have you heard about
this videotape

20
00:01:08,716 --> 00:01:10,479
that kills you
when you watch it?

21
00:01:11,018 --> 00:01:12,212
What kind of tape?

22
00:01:12,253 --> 00:01:14,483
A tape, a regular tape.

23
00:01:14,522 --> 00:01:15,853
People rent it, I don't know.

24
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,187
You start to play it

25
00:01:17,225 --> 00:01:19,955
and it's, like,
somebody's nightmare.

26
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:23,430
Then suddenly,
this woman comes on

27
00:01:23,464 --> 00:01:25,728
smiling at you, right?

28
00:01:25,767 --> 00:01:28,964
Seeing you through the screen...

29
00:01:29,003 --> 00:01:31,699
and as soon as
it's over...

30
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:33,502
your phone rings.

31
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:36,635
Someone knows
you've watched it

32
00:01:36,677 --> 00:01:39,202
and what they say is...

33
00:01:39,247 --> 00:01:42,512
''You will die
in seven days''

34
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,518
and exactly seven
days later...

35
00:01:46,053 --> 00:01:47,020
Who told you that?

36
00:01:47,054 --> 00:01:48,817
Somebody from Revere.
I don't...

37
00:01:48,856 --> 00:01:50,153
Who told you?

38
00:01:50,191 --> 00:01:52,250
What's your problem?

39
00:01:52,293 --> 00:01:55,490
I've watched it.

40
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,657
It's a story, Katie.

41
00:01:57,698 --> 00:01:59,529
No, me and Josh,
we saw it last weekend.

42
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:00,693
I thought you were
with your parents.

43
00:02:00,735 --> 00:02:01,861
I wanted to tell you.

44
00:02:01,903 --> 00:02:03,029
You were with
Josh all weekend?

45
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,697
Some of his friends
got this-this place

46
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:05,706
up in the mountains.

47
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,731
They were trying
to record a football game.

48
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:09,402
I guess the reception
was so bad...

49
00:02:09,444 --> 00:02:10,433
What are you talking about?

50
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:11,445
Listen to me!

51
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,845
When we played the tape,
the game wasn't there.

52
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:16,611
It was...

53
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:18,278
What?

54
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,911
Wh-What was it?

55
00:02:19,954 --> 00:02:22,946
It was something else.

56
00:02:25,526 --> 00:02:29,223
We thought it was
some kind of sick joke...

57
00:02:29,263 --> 00:02:31,390
and then the phone rang.

58
00:02:33,734 --> 00:02:35,702
It was a week ago...

59
00:02:35,736 --> 00:02:39,832
one week ago tonight.

60
00:02:41,876 --> 00:02:44,174
You're just trying to scare me.

61
00:02:53,354 --> 00:02:55,413
Oh, my God, Katie!

62
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:57,150
Are you okay?

63
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:58,419
Katie... oh, my...

64
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:01,961
You freak!

65
00:03:01,996 --> 00:03:03,964
You totally fell for it!

66
00:03:03,998 --> 00:03:05,659
No.

67
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,137
So... did you guys,
you know, do anything?

68
00:03:10,171 --> 00:03:13,368
Like what?

69
00:03:13,407 --> 00:03:16,035
Oh, my God, you totally did!

70
00:03:16,077 --> 00:03:17,305
You ho!

71
00:03:17,345 --> 00:03:18,573
Tell me now!

72
00:03:35,363 --> 00:03:37,991
There really is a tape?

73
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:02,686
This is so lame.

74
00:04:02,723 --> 00:04:03,849
Wait, don't!

75
00:04:03,891 --> 00:04:05,859
Embrey residence.

76
00:04:23,744 --> 00:04:27,043
Hello.

77
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:29,049
Hi, Mom.

78
00:04:31,052 --> 00:04:32,178
Yeah, that was Becca.

79
00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:33,345
My mom says hi.

80
00:04:33,387 --> 00:04:34,513
She's glad you're here.

81
00:04:34,555 --> 00:04:36,682
Ask her where she keeps
the Vicodin.

82
00:04:37,892 --> 00:04:39,860
Yeah, we're about
to go to sleep.

83
00:04:39,894 --> 00:04:43,022
Okay. Yeah, I will.

84
00:04:43,064 --> 00:04:47,160
Okay! Okay, yeah, yeah, I will.

85
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:50,170
No, I won't.

86
00:04:50,204 --> 00:04:51,501
Bye, Mom.

87
00:05:17,198 --> 00:05:18,825
Becca, quit being a bitch.

88
00:05:18,866 --> 00:05:20,356
Where's the remote?

89
00:05:45,693 --> 00:05:47,593
Becca, quit it!

90
00:06:45,553 --> 00:06:48,488
Becca, can you hear me?

91
00:07:47,681 --> 00:07:49,444
Don't tell me what to write!

92
00:07:49,483 --> 00:07:51,610
That asshole's screaming
for my attention

93
00:07:51,652 --> 00:07:53,882
and I'm not going
to give it to him.

94
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:55,286
I am being objective!

95
00:07:55,322 --> 00:07:57,381
Listen, Harvey,
you punctilious prick

96
00:07:57,424 --> 00:07:58,516
you touch my column

97
00:07:58,559 --> 00:08:01,357
and I'm coming down there
and poking your eye out

98
00:08:01,395 --> 00:08:03,955
with that little red pencil
you like so much!

99
00:08:03,998 --> 00:08:05,260
Harvey?

100
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:06,960
Shit!

101
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:11,961
Hey...

102
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:14,304
Hey.

103
00:08:14,341 --> 00:08:16,138
Sorry I'm late.

104
00:08:16,177 --> 00:08:18,145
No worries.

105
00:08:18,179 --> 00:08:20,170
I'll wait in the car.

106
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:24,583
Have you got a moment,
Ms. Keller?

107
00:08:24,618 --> 00:08:25,744
Um, sure.

108
00:08:25,786 --> 00:08:27,253
Call me Rachel.

109
00:08:27,288 --> 00:08:28,880
Please, sit down.

110
00:08:28,923 --> 00:08:31,619
He certainly is
very independent, isn't he?

111
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:33,126
Oh, yeah, he sure is.

112
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,355
I never have to tell him
to do anything.

113
00:08:35,396 --> 00:08:36,761
Well, if that's a problem

114
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:39,493
you'd be the first teacher
in history to say so.

115
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:41,501
Ms. Keller...

116
00:08:41,535 --> 00:08:42,297
Rachel.

117
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,297
I know that Aidan recently lost

118
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:46,431
his cousin...

119
00:08:46,473 --> 00:08:47,667
Yes, and I'm doing what I can

120
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,505
to find him some good
daycare. It's just...

121
00:08:49,543 --> 00:08:50,874
Oh, no,
that's not what I meant.

122
00:08:50,911 --> 00:08:52,105
By all means, take your time.

123
00:08:52,146 --> 00:08:54,808
I know they were very close,
Aidan and his cousin.

124
00:08:54,849 --> 00:08:57,409
Yeah. They spent a few
nights a week together.

125
00:08:57,451 --> 00:08:59,783
Did he talk to you
about her death?

126
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,256
Well, like you said, he's
not the talkative type.

127
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,952
That doesn't mean
he has nothing to say.

128
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:10,490
He knows I'm there.

129
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:12,999
Yes, I'm sure he does

130
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:17,299
but he may be expressing himself
in... other ways.

131
00:09:17,338 --> 00:09:20,068
I'd like to show you something.

132
00:09:30,351 --> 00:09:32,751
That's his cousin.

133
00:09:32,786 --> 00:09:34,413
That's Katie.

134
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:38,516
Ms. Keller...
I'm bothered by these drawings.

135
00:09:41,295 --> 00:09:44,355
Listen, I appreciate
your concern

136
00:09:44,398 --> 00:09:47,834
but my son lost his best
friend three nights ago.

137
00:09:47,868 --> 00:09:49,802
He's just trying
to deal with it.

138
00:09:49,837 --> 00:09:52,203
Yes, I understand,
but these pictures...

139
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:53,831
Are Aidan's way
of working it out...

140
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:55,636
of expressing himself,
like you said.

141
00:09:57,344 --> 00:09:59,835
He'll be okay.

142
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:04,645
You say she died
three nights ago?

143
00:10:04,685 --> 00:10:06,152
Yeah, that's right.

144
00:10:06,186 --> 00:10:09,349
Aidan drew these last week.

145
00:10:34,181 --> 00:10:36,274
What?

146
00:10:37,151 --> 00:10:39,016
Nothing.

147
00:10:48,128 --> 00:10:50,096
Shall we read something?

148
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,654
I'm kind of tired.

149
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:52,825
Okay.

150
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:56,299
Sweet dreams.

151
00:10:58,906 --> 00:11:00,897
We don't have enough time.

152
00:11:03,544 --> 00:11:06,172
Oh, honey,
I know I've been working a lot

153
00:11:06,213 --> 00:11:07,271
and I'm sorry

154
00:11:07,314 --> 00:11:10,340
but I promise you,
I'm going to make it up to you.

155
00:11:10,384 --> 00:11:12,545
I'm not talking about that.

156
00:11:12,586 --> 00:11:15,714
I'm talking about
time before we die.

157
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:19,192
You have lots of time.

158
00:11:19,226 --> 00:11:21,694
So, you know when I'm going
to die?

159
00:11:21,729 --> 00:11:22,696
No.

160
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,197
No one does

161
00:11:24,231 --> 00:11:27,223
but I know you don't have
to worry about it.

162
00:11:28,736 --> 00:11:29,930
Katie knew.

163
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:31,436
She told me.

164
00:11:31,472 --> 00:11:34,032
Katie told you she was going
to die?

165
00:11:34,074 --> 00:11:36,770
She said she didn't
have enough time.

166
00:11:39,847 --> 00:11:41,906
Good night, Rachel.

167
00:11:58,932 --> 00:12:01,400
Oh, shit!

168
00:12:04,171 --> 00:12:06,298
Aidan...

169
00:12:08,175 --> 00:12:09,369
Goddamn it!

170
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,707
Honey?!

171
00:12:10,744 --> 00:12:13,804
Have you seen my black dress?

172
00:12:13,847 --> 00:12:15,838
Aidan?

173
00:12:15,883 --> 00:12:18,215
Have you seen my black...

174
00:12:18,252 --> 00:12:20,243
dress?

175
00:12:23,223 --> 00:12:24,952
It's a little wrinkled.

176
00:12:30,264 --> 00:12:31,925
It's fine.

177
00:13:11,972 --> 00:13:13,633
Yeah. Thank you.

178
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:42,001
Kids don't have strokes...

179
00:13:42,035 --> 00:13:43,969
unless they're on drugs.

180
00:13:44,004 --> 00:13:46,336
So, then,
why the closed coffin?

181
00:13:50,611 --> 00:13:52,579
Oh, Ruthie.

182
00:13:52,613 --> 00:13:55,241
I'm so sorry.

183
00:14:04,558 --> 00:14:06,526
You all right, Dave?

184
00:14:08,562 --> 00:14:11,463
Yeah, I'm fine.

185
00:14:11,498 --> 00:14:13,864
How are you?

186
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:25,500
He sleeps all day.

187
00:14:25,546 --> 00:14:26,843
He doesn't move.

188
00:14:28,048 --> 00:14:31,074
It's too much for him.

189
00:14:33,086 --> 00:14:36,351
It doesn't make
any sense, Rachel.

190
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,984
I spent four hours
on the Internet

191
00:14:39,026 --> 00:14:41,620
and I couldn't find
one single case

192
00:14:41,662 --> 00:14:45,063
of a 16-year-old girl's
heart just stopping.

193
00:14:45,098 --> 00:14:48,499
I spoke to three different
doctors and not one of them

194
00:14:48,535 --> 00:14:53,097
could tell me exactly what
happened to my daughter.

195
00:14:57,211 --> 00:15:01,147
She was close... with you.

196
00:15:01,215 --> 00:15:02,842
And Aidan.

197
00:15:02,883 --> 00:15:05,511
But she confided in you.

198
00:15:05,552 --> 00:15:08,020
Yeah, but she never
said anything...

199
00:15:08,055 --> 00:15:10,922
nothing that would explain
what happened.

200
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,017
But you could find out.

201
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,551
It's what you do, isn't it--

202
00:15:15,596 --> 00:15:17,086
ask questions?

203
00:15:19,132 --> 00:15:21,464
Rachel, please.

204
00:15:25,806 --> 00:15:28,297
I saw her face.

205
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:40,286
I knew Becca.

206
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,811
I mean, she was a little
intense, but she wasn't crazy.

207
00:15:42,856 --> 00:15:44,824
They don't put you in booties
and a straightjacket

208
00:15:44,858 --> 00:15:46,519
if you're just freaked out.

209
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,757
Something scared the shit
out of her.

210
00:15:49,796 --> 00:15:51,024
Hi.

211
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,901
So, who's
in the mental hospital?

212
00:15:56,103 --> 00:15:57,400
Becca...

213
00:15:57,604 --> 00:15:59,071
Katie's friend.

214
00:15:59,106 --> 00:16:00,596
Oh, right.
She was the one who was...

215
00:16:00,641 --> 00:16:02,973
There when it happened.

216
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:06,673
So, what do you think
they were doing up there?

217
00:16:08,348 --> 00:16:10,612
Oh, thanks.

218
00:16:10,651 --> 00:16:12,710
I remember I was that age.

219
00:16:12,753 --> 00:16:14,983
Me and my girlfriend used to

220
00:16:15,022 --> 00:16:17,217
sneak up to my room, get high.

221
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:19,986
Do you think maybe
she was into...?

222
00:16:20,027 --> 00:16:21,494
It's not about that.

223
00:16:21,528 --> 00:16:24,429
It's about the tape.

224
00:16:24,464 --> 00:16:26,091
Kellen, don't even.

225
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:27,600
What tape?

226
00:16:27,634 --> 00:16:29,659
The one that kills you
when you watch it.

227
00:16:29,703 --> 00:16:31,227
Oh, please.

228
00:16:31,338 --> 00:16:33,898
What was on the tape?

229
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,840
I haven't seen it, obviously.

230
00:16:35,876 --> 00:16:37,537
But Katie told you

231
00:16:37,577 --> 00:16:38,805
she saw this tape?

232
00:16:38,845 --> 00:16:40,335
Not Katie.

233
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,678
I heard it from her boyf...

234
00:16:42,716 --> 00:16:44,377
You heard it from who?

235
00:16:44,418 --> 00:16:47,615
She was dating
this guy Josh.

236
00:16:47,654 --> 00:16:48,985
He goes to Revere.

237
00:16:49,022 --> 00:16:50,990
It was kind
of a secret.

238
00:16:51,024 --> 00:16:52,150
Kind of?

239
00:16:52,192 --> 00:16:54,251
Where is he-- Josh?
Is-Is he here?

240
00:16:54,294 --> 00:16:55,352
Josh is dead.

241
00:16:55,395 --> 00:16:57,829
What?

242
00:16:57,864 --> 00:16:59,923
What happened?

243
00:16:59,966 --> 00:17:02,366
Supposedly, he killed himself...

244
00:17:02,402 --> 00:17:04,836
the same night that Katie died.

245
00:18:27,254 --> 00:18:31,054
Aidan... what are
you doing in here?

246
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:34,356
Come on.

247
00:18:34,394 --> 00:18:36,692
We shouldn't be in her room.

248
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:38,994
It's not her room anymore.

249
00:20:16,696 --> 00:20:18,687
10:00 p.m.

250
00:20:36,449 --> 00:20:39,850
10:00 p.m.

251
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,585
Time of death, Wade

252
00:20:42,622 --> 00:20:44,249
that's all I want to know.

253
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,724
The name's Katie Embrey.

254
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:47,920
Pull the report
and read the time.

255
00:20:47,961 --> 00:20:50,930
No, that's okay. I'll hold.

256
00:20:50,964 --> 00:20:53,899
''Punctilious prick''?

257
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:55,401
Nice alliteration, huh?

258
00:20:55,435 --> 00:20:56,561
You're fired.

259
00:20:56,603 --> 00:20:57,570
No, I'm not.

260
00:20:57,604 --> 00:20:58,662
Yes, you are.

261
00:20:58,705 --> 00:21:00,297
No, I'm not.

262
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,173
I'm cooking too good a story.

263
00:21:03,209 --> 00:21:04,801
What is it?

264
00:21:04,844 --> 00:21:06,505
Yeah, I'm still here.

265
00:21:08,348 --> 00:21:09,679
Shh!

266
00:21:12,686 --> 00:21:15,018
Okay, so what's
the time of death?

267
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,734
Hi. I was wondering...

268
00:22:02,769 --> 00:22:05,135
Pick a card, any card.

269
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:06,832
Go ahead.

270
00:22:06,873 --> 00:22:09,501
Okay, put it back.

271
00:22:09,542 --> 00:22:11,601
Don't let me see it.

272
00:22:16,683 --> 00:22:18,116
That your card?

273
00:22:18,151 --> 00:22:19,584
No.

274
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:22,588
Damn.

275
00:22:22,622 --> 00:22:24,214
I was wondering
if you'd remember someone

276
00:22:24,257 --> 00:22:25,224
from a week ago.

277
00:22:25,258 --> 00:22:27,192
Was there a problem?

278
00:22:27,227 --> 00:22:28,592
It's my niece.

279
00:22:28,662 --> 00:22:30,721
She sort of ran out

280
00:22:30,764 --> 00:22:32,254
on her parents.

281
00:22:32,298 --> 00:22:34,095
No.

282
00:22:34,134 --> 00:22:35,533
I have some photos here.

283
00:22:35,568 --> 00:22:37,900
That's her and her friends.

284
00:22:37,937 --> 00:22:39,598
I think they stayed
here a night or so.

285
00:22:39,639 --> 00:22:41,869
Yeah, they were in Cabin 12.

286
00:22:41,908 --> 00:22:45,071
They didn't pay.

287
00:22:45,111 --> 00:22:48,774
Had a number of complaints,
about the TV, mainly.

288
00:22:48,815 --> 00:22:51,340
Uh, reception's never good here.

289
00:22:51,384 --> 00:22:52,942
That's why we bought

290
00:22:52,986 --> 00:22:55,614
tape players for videos.

291
00:22:55,722 --> 00:22:58,020
Quite a selection.

292
00:23:00,293 --> 00:23:01,624
Mostly they're hand-me-downs

293
00:23:01,695 --> 00:23:02,821
left by other guests.

294
00:23:02,862 --> 00:23:06,491
Anyway, they didn't pay.

295
00:23:06,533 --> 00:23:08,967
And kids like that
sometimes don't.

296
00:23:09,002 --> 00:23:10,560
Miss?

297
00:23:10,603 --> 00:23:12,298
You know, I'm kind of tired.

298
00:23:12,338 --> 00:23:15,307
I'm thinking I might take a nap
before I drive back.

299
00:23:16,509 --> 00:23:18,272
I'll take Cabin 12.

300
00:23:31,091 --> 00:23:31,989
Hey.

301
00:23:33,393 --> 00:23:36,089
This is your card, right?

302
00:23:38,298 --> 00:23:40,664
That's it.

303
00:26:29,535 --> 00:26:32,129
Seven days.

304
00:27:01,467 --> 00:27:03,958
I'm going to school.

305
00:27:16,816 --> 00:27:19,284
Hold up.

306
00:27:40,573 --> 00:27:42,200
What do you think?

307
00:27:42,241 --> 00:27:44,641
Well, it's a pretty cool effect.

308
00:27:44,677 --> 00:27:49,546
What does this have to do
with the tape?

309
00:27:49,582 --> 00:27:52,745
Take my picture.

310
00:27:57,123 --> 00:27:58,590
Are you going to look at me

311
00:27:58,624 --> 00:28:00,819
at least?

312
00:28:05,865 --> 00:28:07,526
This the same camera?

313
00:28:07,567 --> 00:28:10,468
No. Scan the rest.

314
00:28:14,173 --> 00:28:16,004
So, what do you think?

315
00:28:19,345 --> 00:28:21,939
Well, look, I thought you said
this was about a tape.

316
00:28:29,255 --> 00:28:31,280
I'm thinking maybe
you shouldn't see it.

317
00:28:32,492 --> 00:28:35,120
No, I should know
more about it first.

318
00:28:35,161 --> 00:28:37,095
Well, isn't that why I'm here?

319
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,394
So you can benefit
from my wisdom?

320
00:28:39,432 --> 00:28:41,127
Four kids are dead, Noah.

321
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:44,500
Not from watching a videotape.

322
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,268
Come on, show it to me.

323
00:30:04,283 --> 00:30:05,773
Roll credits.

324
00:30:05,818 --> 00:30:09,151
That was very student film.

325
00:30:10,456 --> 00:30:14,324
I'm sure it's a lot...
scarier at night.

326
00:30:21,234 --> 00:30:23,634
You going to get that?

327
00:30:43,022 --> 00:30:44,319
So, you been working a lot?

328
00:30:44,357 --> 00:30:46,655
I'm not tired, Noah.

329
00:30:46,692 --> 00:30:47,989
Okay.

330
00:30:48,027 --> 00:30:50,325
That tape didn't scare you?

331
00:30:50,363 --> 00:30:51,830
No, not really. Sorry.

332
00:30:51,864 --> 00:30:52,888
Four people are dead.

333
00:30:52,932 --> 00:30:55,025
Yeah, but like I said,
not from watching...

334
00:30:55,067 --> 00:30:56,329
Four people who watched it.

335
00:30:56,369 --> 00:30:57,529
Come on, we watched it.

336
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:58,537
We're hanging.

337
00:30:58,571 --> 00:31:00,698
It... takes a week.

338
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,868
Right. Yeah, I'm just
going to go downtown.

339
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,537
I got to pick up some
cameras from this guy

340
00:31:05,578 --> 00:31:06,670
and then I got
to prep this thing

341
00:31:06,712 --> 00:31:07,906
that I may end up
doing next week.

342
00:31:07,947 --> 00:31:09,107
--Noah...
--Hmm?

343
00:31:09,148 --> 00:31:11,582
Would you say that I'm gullible?

344
00:31:11,617 --> 00:31:12,709
No.

345
00:31:12,752 --> 00:31:13,719
Easily rattled?

346
00:31:13,753 --> 00:31:14,777
Definitely not.

347
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,912
I mean, you're a little

348
00:31:15,955 --> 00:31:17,582
highly strung maybe.

349
00:31:17,623 --> 00:31:19,716
And you ain't much
of a dresser.

350
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:20,726
Who made it?

351
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,591
Where'd it come from?

352
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,527
All right.

353
00:31:25,565 --> 00:31:29,228
Make me a copy.
I'll see what I can do.

354
00:31:33,906 --> 00:31:34,895
Thanks.

355
00:31:37,043 --> 00:31:39,637
Yeah.

356
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,517
You sure this is a copy?

357
00:33:29,555 --> 00:33:31,682
Yeah, why?

358
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:35,659
The numbers are all screwed up.

359
00:33:37,196 --> 00:33:42,031
The same problem
got copied, I guess.

360
00:33:42,401 --> 00:33:43,425
That's impossible.

361
00:33:43,469 --> 00:33:45,027
The numbers of
the control track

362
00:33:45,071 --> 00:33:47,266
they put on the tape
whenever it's recorded

363
00:33:47,306 --> 00:33:50,139
which means theoretically,
there shouldn't be any images.

364
00:33:50,176 --> 00:33:52,542
Hey, Noah, can you pretend
for one minute

365
00:33:52,578 --> 00:33:54,808
that I don't read
Video Geek Magazine?

366
00:33:54,847 --> 00:33:56,280
Okay, when you record a tape

367
00:33:56,382 --> 00:33:58,748
the makeup of the tracks
is like a signature

368
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,513
for whatever did the recording

369
00:34:00,553 --> 00:34:02,919
like a camcorder,
VCR, whatever.

370
00:34:02,955 --> 00:34:05,617
So the control track could
tell us where it came from.

371
00:34:05,658 --> 00:34:07,125
But to not have one...

372
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:09,457
I mean, that's like being born
without fingerprints.

373
00:34:09,495 --> 00:34:12,259
Then, how did this get recorded?

374
00:34:12,298 --> 00:34:14,198
I don't know.

375
00:34:14,233 --> 00:34:17,634
But I'm going to find out.

376
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,262
All right, take a look.

377
00:34:19,305 --> 00:34:21,500
You should be able
to see the camera here

378
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,700
in the reflection.

379
00:34:22,742 --> 00:34:24,801
The angle's straight
on, but you don't.

380
00:34:24,844 --> 00:34:26,573
Hmm. What's that?

381
00:34:27,279 --> 00:34:28,439
It looks like she's walking away

382
00:34:28,481 --> 00:34:29,448
whoever she is.

383
00:34:29,482 --> 00:34:31,245
No, I mean up there at the top.

384
00:34:32,451 --> 00:34:34,442
Oh, no, that's
just the tracking.

385
00:34:34,487 --> 00:34:36,079
I can fix that.

386
00:34:36,122 --> 00:34:37,111
Whup, sorry.

387
00:34:37,156 --> 00:34:38,123
Wait, go back.

388
00:34:38,157 --> 00:34:39,317
There's something there.

389
00:34:39,425 --> 00:34:41,290
Yeah, you're right.

390
00:34:41,327 --> 00:34:42,726
--There's more picture.
--Hold on.

391
00:34:42,762 --> 00:34:43,922
I'm going to stretch
the alignment.

392
00:34:43,963 --> 00:34:45,123
Yeah, it's working.

393
00:34:45,164 --> 00:34:46,131
Yeah, it won't go any further.

394
00:34:46,165 --> 00:34:47,097
Okay, keep going.

395
00:34:47,133 --> 00:34:48,100
No, no, no, no, let me do it.

396
00:34:48,134 --> 00:34:49,123
Wait, it won't go any further.

397
00:34:49,168 --> 00:34:50,260
It won't go any further!
Get...

398
00:34:50,302 --> 00:34:51,530
--Let me do it.
--Shit!

399
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:52,537
Oh...

400
00:34:54,473 --> 00:34:55,337
Hey, Noah

401
00:34:55,374 --> 00:34:56,602
I picked up the cameras.

402
00:34:56,642 --> 00:34:57,973
They're in really good shape.

403
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,443
Did you see the reprints I did

404
00:34:59,478 --> 00:35:01,173
of that Guatemala stuff?

405
00:35:01,213 --> 00:35:03,704
'Cause they came out kind of...

406
00:35:03,749 --> 00:35:05,148
overexposed.

407
00:35:05,184 --> 00:35:06,549
You working?

408
00:35:06,585 --> 00:35:08,815
This is a friend, Rachel Keller.

409
00:35:08,854 --> 00:35:10,446
She writes for the ''P.I.''

410
00:35:10,489 --> 00:35:12,855
Rachel, this is Beth,
my assistant.

411
00:35:12,892 --> 00:35:15,224
Well, I prefer
''partner in crime.''

412
00:35:16,662 --> 00:35:18,994
She's a journalism student
at Kirkland, actually.

413
00:35:19,031 --> 00:35:20,555
Well, I'll stay
out of your way.

414
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:21,588
I'm not even here.

415
00:35:23,502 --> 00:35:26,733
Rachel is researching a story.
It's this video hoax.

416
00:35:26,772 --> 00:35:28,672
It's sort of interesting.
So you know video.

417
00:35:28,707 --> 00:35:30,538
Why don't you come take a look
at this thing with the tracking.

418
00:35:30,576 --> 00:35:31,565
You know, I'm late.

419
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:32,577
I really should go.

420
00:35:32,611 --> 00:35:33,873
Yeah, but why are you taking...?

421
00:35:33,913 --> 00:35:35,005
I got to go.

422
00:35:35,047 --> 00:35:36,537
It's good to meet you.

423
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,347
So you're taking the tape?

424
00:35:43,389 --> 00:35:44,617
I don't want her to see it.

425
00:35:44,657 --> 00:35:46,318
Whoa. You don't
want her to see it?

426
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:47,382
What about me
seeing it?

427
00:35:47,493 --> 00:35:49,222
You had no problem
showing it to me.

428
00:35:49,261 --> 00:35:51,661
I did have a problem.

429
00:35:51,697 --> 00:35:52,686
You're angry.

430
00:35:52,731 --> 00:35:53,857
I'm not angry.

431
00:35:53,899 --> 00:35:55,560
Oh, no? What
are you then?

432
00:35:55,601 --> 00:35:57,159
In a hurry.

433
00:35:58,404 --> 00:36:01,032
Look, I'm sorry, but I'm
not going to get all worked up

434
00:36:01,073 --> 00:36:02,438
over some high school rumor.

435
00:36:05,044 --> 00:36:07,171
What are you thinking?

436
00:36:07,213 --> 00:36:09,408
I'm thinking this is
the part where I say

437
00:36:09,515 --> 00:36:11,779
''You're a flake,
never finishes anything.''

438
00:36:11,817 --> 00:36:13,876
Then you say
I'm ''an obsessive bitch.

439
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:15,352
Needs to lighten up.''

440
00:36:15,387 --> 00:36:16,547
Then I storm out

441
00:36:16,589 --> 00:36:18,955
all pissed off, kicking myself
for ever thinking

442
00:36:18,991 --> 00:36:20,424
that you could just...

443
00:36:20,493 --> 00:36:22,723
grow up.

444
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:29,729
So, why don't we just
cut to that part right now

445
00:36:29,768 --> 00:36:32,066
and save ourselves
a lot of grief?

446
00:36:34,507 --> 00:36:36,134
All right.

447
00:36:36,175 --> 00:36:38,234
Bye.

448
00:37:05,804 --> 00:37:07,328
Watch out, missy.

449
00:37:07,373 --> 00:37:09,364
Bad luck.
You don't need that.

450
00:37:39,405 --> 00:37:41,305
Becca?

451
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:44,104
Becca.

452
00:37:44,143 --> 00:37:46,338
We're almost there.

453
00:37:46,378 --> 00:37:47,504
Summer, actually.

454
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,514
So circle gets that square.

455
00:37:49,582 --> 00:37:52,483
We take a break,
while you check this out.

456
00:37:52,518 --> 00:37:54,748
This is how you can be part...

457
00:37:54,787 --> 00:37:56,812
Do you remember anything

458
00:37:56,855 --> 00:37:58,083
about that night...

459
00:37:58,123 --> 00:38:00,182
that night with Katie?

460
00:38:03,028 --> 00:38:05,656
Do you remember...

461
00:38:05,698 --> 00:38:07,689
how she died?

462
00:38:10,135 --> 00:38:12,797
Becca?

463
00:38:22,815 --> 00:38:25,215
She told you about a videotape,
didn't she?

464
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:33,481
She was afraid, wasn't she?

465
00:38:33,525 --> 00:38:36,426
Something was happening to her.

466
00:38:36,462 --> 00:38:38,930
Becca...

467
00:38:38,964 --> 00:38:41,990
how did she die?

468
00:38:42,034 --> 00:38:43,763
Please.

469
00:38:43,802 --> 00:38:45,929
I need to know.

470
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:50,872
And you will.

471
00:38:55,014 --> 00:38:56,948
She'll show you.

472
00:38:56,982 --> 00:38:58,574
Who?

473
00:38:58,651 --> 00:39:01,484
Who will show me?

474
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,614
Not now.

475
00:39:10,396 --> 00:39:13,559
Four days.

476
00:39:20,305 --> 00:39:21,397
Yeah, well, your home VCRs

477
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,702
will give you a tracking window

478
00:39:22,741 --> 00:39:24,072
but they won't
let you stretch it.

479
00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:26,543
There's no point, really, unless
you're talking restoration.

480
00:39:26,578 --> 00:39:27,772
Archives will come in here

481
00:39:27,813 --> 00:39:29,576
with these crummy old tapes
sometimes.

482
00:39:29,615 --> 00:39:31,776
Tracks totally shot--
servos can't line them up.

483
00:39:31,817 --> 00:39:33,341
But the big box here's
a warhorse.

484
00:39:33,385 --> 00:39:34,352
Totally analog.

485
00:39:34,386 --> 00:39:36,513
She'll read to the very edge
of your tape.

486
00:39:36,555 --> 00:39:39,353
Just don't force her or
she'll get pissy with you.

487
00:39:39,391 --> 00:39:42,622
Your tracking, your monitor,
your printer, if you need it.

488
00:39:42,695 --> 00:39:45,061
So, uh...

489
00:39:45,097 --> 00:39:47,531
what are we watching,
home movies or something?

490
00:39:47,566 --> 00:39:50,967
I'd really
rather watch it alone.

491
00:39:51,003 --> 00:39:52,732
Really.

492
00:39:52,771 --> 00:39:54,671
Whatever.

493
00:40:09,154 --> 00:40:11,486
Come on...

494
00:40:15,961 --> 00:40:17,622
Come on.

495
00:40:31,577 --> 00:40:33,602
Lighthouse.

496
00:40:36,448 --> 00:40:38,609
Shit.

497
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:41,084
Hello? Somebody?

498
00:40:47,126 --> 00:40:49,959
Damn.

499
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,425
Something you needed help with?

500
00:41:27,733 --> 00:41:30,167
Hey, you... you got a... ya...

501
00:41:40,045 --> 00:41:42,240
Well, that seems to be
the lot of it.

502
00:41:42,281 --> 00:41:43,805

Used the patch...
never looked back.

All right, well,
I'll keep that in mind.

You, too.

522

Hi.

523
00:46:22,561 --> 00:46:24,119
Sorry I'm late.

524
00:46:24,162 --> 00:46:26,130
Uh... mmm... no. No problem.

525
00:46:26,164 --> 00:46:27,927
Everything okay?

526
00:46:27,966 --> 00:46:30,799
Oh, yeah. He was an angel.

527
00:46:30,836 --> 00:46:33,669
I-I... went in to tell him
that it was bedtime

528
00:46:33,705 --> 00:46:35,900
and he was already
under the covers.

529
00:46:35,941 --> 00:46:38,136
And then he read me
a bedtime story.

530
00:46:38,176 --> 00:46:40,508
Um...

531
00:46:40,545 --> 00:46:42,570
he learned the word ''conundrum.''

532
00:46:42,614 --> 00:46:43,581
Really?

533
00:46:43,615 --> 00:46:46,880
Yeah. And then...
he drew my picture.

534
00:46:46,918 --> 00:46:49,045
Well, here you go.

535
00:46:49,154 --> 00:46:50,451
Thanks.

536
00:46:50,489 --> 00:46:51,649
Sure.

537
00:47:24,623 --> 00:47:25,590
Hey, Ruthie, it's me.

538
00:47:25,624 --> 00:47:27,854
I'm sorry to call so late,
but I need a favor.

539
00:47:27,893 --> 00:47:29,622
I have to go upstate
to do this story

540
00:47:29,661 --> 00:47:31,390
and I need you
to watch Aidan for me.

541
00:47:31,429 --> 00:47:33,488
Oh, Rachel, I don't know.

542
00:47:33,532 --> 00:47:34,794
How long will you be gone?

543
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:36,460
It's just for two days,
I promise.

544
00:47:36,501 --> 00:47:38,059
This isn't the best time for me.

545
00:47:39,104 --> 00:47:41,402
Rachel? Rachel, are you there?

546
00:47:41,439 --> 00:47:43,407
Hold on a sec...
Sorry.

547
00:47:45,844 --> 00:47:47,573
Rachel?

548
00:47:47,612 --> 00:47:49,102
Is this about Katie?

549
00:48:13,772 --> 00:48:16,002
Ruthie...

550
00:48:37,929 --> 00:48:39,920
Aidan?

551
00:49:50,402 --> 00:49:52,199
No!

552
00:50:00,578 --> 00:50:02,910
Why, baby, why? Why?!

553
00:50:02,947 --> 00:50:04,744
I couldn't sleep.

554
00:50:09,688 --> 00:50:13,180
Who is she, Rachel?

555
00:50:29,974 --> 00:50:31,839
Leave him alone!

556
00:50:31,876 --> 00:50:33,241
Rachel?

557
00:50:37,682 --> 00:50:38,979
Noah...

558
00:50:39,017 --> 00:50:40,450
L-Listen to me. R-Rachel...

559
00:50:40,485 --> 00:50:42,453
I need to talk to you, okay?

560
00:50:42,487 --> 00:50:44,546
I...

561
00:50:47,392 --> 00:50:49,292
I believe you.

562
00:50:49,327 --> 00:50:52,524
Rachel, you there?

563
00:50:53,998 --> 00:50:57,161
He... He watched the tape.

564
00:50:57,202 --> 00:51:00,137
Who? Who watched it?

565
00:51:03,641 --> 00:51:05,802
Our son.

566
00:51:30,635 --> 00:51:32,432
You took my picture.

567
00:51:36,808 --> 00:51:39,606
I've seen you.

568
00:51:39,644 --> 00:51:43,341
When I'm in the yard at school.

569
00:51:43,415 --> 00:51:45,406
You're there.

570
00:51:46,651 --> 00:51:48,744
You wish I was around more?

571
00:51:48,787 --> 00:51:51,585
No.

572
00:51:51,623 --> 00:51:53,352
Do you want to be around more?

573
00:51:54,726 --> 00:51:56,489
Rachel and I were...

574
00:51:56,528 --> 00:51:58,462
Young.

575
00:51:58,496 --> 00:52:00,487
Mom's told me that story.

576
00:52:04,869 --> 00:52:06,894
The thing is, I...

577
00:52:06,938 --> 00:52:09,532
I don't think
I'd make a good father.

578
00:52:11,443 --> 00:52:14,378
Maybe it was because
my own was...

579
00:52:14,446 --> 00:52:17,609
such a... disappointment.

580
00:52:26,157 --> 00:52:29,149
Thing is, I don't want
anyone else to do it, either.

581
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:34,794
Be your father.

582
00:52:34,833 --> 00:52:36,391
It's a conundrum.

583
00:52:40,605 --> 00:52:42,539
Yeah, it is.

584
00:53:20,745 --> 00:53:22,440
Time to go, mister.

585
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,640
I'm not finished.

586
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:28,712
Noah said to make one for you.

587
00:53:36,294 --> 00:53:37,818
You could almost draw

588
00:53:37,862 --> 00:53:40,160
a line through her life.

589
00:53:40,198 --> 00:53:42,723
On one side,
there's this happy woman

590
00:53:42,767 --> 00:53:46,464
who spends her time with her
husband, riding horses

591
00:53:46,538 --> 00:53:50,099
everything sheltered,
protected and comfortable.

592
00:53:50,141 --> 00:53:54,703
Her face, there's... light,
there's pride.

593
00:53:54,746 --> 00:53:56,941
And then, one day,
something happens

594
00:53:56,981 --> 00:53:59,415
and she takes
this hard corner

595
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:01,475
and the light... goes out

596
00:54:01,553 --> 00:54:04,613
and then she ends up
at Eola County Psychiatric

597
00:54:04,656 --> 00:54:06,624
all alone.

598
00:54:06,658 --> 00:54:08,649
What happened to her?.

599
00:54:08,693 --> 00:54:10,661
l don't know yet

600
00:54:10,695 --> 00:54:13,323
but l think it has something
to do with the horses.

601
00:54:13,364 --> 00:54:15,764
lt think we should go
to the island together.

602
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,324
lt's Tuesday, Noah.

603
00:54:17,368 --> 00:54:19,427
l only have one day left.

604
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:20,903
l need you to go to the
hospital

605
00:54:20,939 --> 00:54:22,839
and find out as much
as you can about Anna.

606
00:54:22,874 --> 00:54:26,867
The images on the tape
are leading us somewhere.

607
00:54:26,911 --> 00:54:28,435
Katie saw them all, too.

608
00:54:28,479 --> 00:54:32,074
I think... before you die

609
00:54:32,116 --> 00:54:34,107
you see the ring.

610
00:54:47,265 --> 00:54:48,323
Shit!

611
00:54:48,366 --> 00:54:51,164
Hey, Rach! Wait!

612
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:47,458
A daughter?

613
00:58:51,993 --> 00:58:54,393
Are you a relative?

614
00:58:54,493 --> 00:58:55,793
Well, no.

615
00:58:55,793 --> 00:58:56,893
I'm sorry, sir.

616
00:58:56,993 --> 00:58:58,793
We're a mental health facility.

617
00:58:58,793 --> 00:59:00,093
Our records are private.

618
00:59:00,093 --> 00:59:01,893
Well, she's been dead 24 years.

619
00:59:01,993 --> 00:59:03,493
I don't think she'll mind.

620
00:59:03,493 --> 00:59:04,793
I'm sorry.

621
00:59:04,793 --> 00:59:06,693
It's impossible.

622
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,793
Look...

623
00:59:08,793 --> 00:59:10,993
I've seen them before.

624
00:59:10,993 --> 00:59:12,493
I've been up there.

625
00:59:12,593 --> 00:59:13,593
Nice try.

626
00:59:13,693 --> 00:59:16,293
The record rooms
are downstairs, guy.

627
00:59:18,393 --> 00:59:20,893
You win.

628
00:59:24,293 --> 00:59:25,793
Jerk off!

629
01:00:05,993 --> 01:00:09,093
Are you in here, Anna?

630
01:00:59,893 --> 01:01:01,893
Hello?

631
01:01:58,993 --> 01:02:00,293
Excuse me, Mr. Morgan.

632
01:02:00,693 --> 01:02:03,693
I was wondering if you'd have
a moment to speak with me.

633
01:02:03,793 --> 01:02:04,793
My name's Rachel Keller.

634
01:02:04,893 --> 01:02:06,393
I'm a writer with
the ''Seattle P.I.''

635
01:02:06,493 --> 01:02:08,393
You want to know
about the horses.

636
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:12,093
I didn't mean to...

637
01:02:12,093 --> 01:02:14,893
It's just I wasn't able to
find a number to reach you.

638
01:02:14,993 --> 01:02:17,893
Every now and then,
a writer comes along...

639
01:02:17,993 --> 01:02:19,793
heard about what happened.

640
01:02:19,793 --> 01:02:23,293
What's left to write about,
though, I don't know.

641
01:02:23,293 --> 01:02:25,893
I was hoping you had
just a few minutes.

642
01:02:25,993 --> 01:02:29,893
Well, work never ends
around here, really...

643
01:02:29,993 --> 01:02:32,193
but I guess I got a few.

644
01:02:32,193 --> 01:02:35,393
So, what is it
you're writing, miss?

645
01:02:35,893 --> 01:02:36,993
About horses in general

646
01:02:37,093 --> 01:02:38,193
or just those that go strange?

647
01:02:38,293 --> 01:02:40,893
I read you had
to put so many down.

648
01:02:40,993 --> 01:02:42,893
Most put themselves down.

649
01:02:42,993 --> 01:02:44,293
They drowned.

650
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:45,393
How'd they get out?

651
01:02:45,493 --> 01:02:46,793
They just broke

652
01:02:46,793 --> 01:02:49,793
through the fences
and ran to the shore.

653
01:02:49,893 --> 01:02:51,393
So, they went crazy?

654
01:02:51,493 --> 01:02:53,593
It would seem so, yes...

655
01:02:53,693 --> 01:02:56,893
or maybe they just sense things
before we do.

656
01:02:58,993 --> 01:03:01,993
So, where are your horses now?

657
01:03:03,993 --> 01:03:05,593
I don't breed anymore.

658
01:03:05,593 --> 01:03:07,893
I guess you wouldn't...

659
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:10,393
not after what happened.

660
01:03:10,393 --> 01:03:14,893
That must've been hard...
on both of you...

661
01:03:14,893 --> 01:03:17,893
you and your wife.

662
01:03:20,493 --> 01:03:25,093
I'm sorry, miss,
what's your name again?

663
01:03:25,193 --> 01:03:26,493
Rachel.

664
01:03:26,593 --> 01:03:27,993
Well, Rachel...

665
01:03:28,093 --> 01:03:31,393
you want to tell me what's
really on your mind?

666
01:03:34,893 --> 01:03:36,893
Do you know what this is?

667
01:03:39,393 --> 01:03:41,393
I think it's a message...

668
01:03:41,393 --> 01:03:43,393
from your wife.

669
01:03:45,193 --> 01:03:46,393
Anna's on this tape.

670
01:03:46,393 --> 01:03:48,093
She's right there in that room.

671
01:03:48,093 --> 01:03:51,593
You can see the lighthouse,
the horses...

672
01:03:53,593 --> 01:03:55,193
Where'd you get that?

673
01:03:55,193 --> 01:03:57,093
Shelter Mountain Inn.

674
01:03:59,093 --> 01:04:00,993
Is that the only one?

675
01:04:03,093 --> 01:04:05,693
I made a copy.

676
01:04:11,893 --> 01:04:15,893
I've got a lot of work
to do today...

677
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:17,893
a lot of acres out there.

678
01:04:17,993 --> 01:04:21,193
Minute I think I'm done
with one thing...

679
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:27,193
...another thing needs fixing.

680
01:04:27,293 --> 01:04:29,493
You don't want to see this tape?

681
01:04:29,493 --> 01:04:31,193
You're not even curious?

682
01:04:31,293 --> 01:04:32,893
Curious?

683
01:04:32,893 --> 01:04:35,293
No. I don't think so.

684
01:04:37,393 --> 01:04:38,793
Mr. Morgan...

685
01:04:38,793 --> 01:04:39,993
I can't help you.

686
01:04:41,993 --> 01:04:43,693
Where's your daughter?

687
01:04:43,793 --> 01:04:45,393
Maybe she couId help...

688
01:04:45,493 --> 01:04:47,793
I don't have a daughter.

689
01:04:47,793 --> 01:04:48,993
Excuse me?

690
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:51,093
What is it with reporters?

691
01:04:51,193 --> 01:04:53,493
You take one person's tragedy

692
01:04:53,593 --> 01:04:56,693
and force the world
to experience it...

693
01:04:56,793 --> 01:05:00,093
spread it like sickness.

694
01:05:00,093 --> 01:05:01,193
Mr. Morgan...

695
01:05:01,193 --> 01:05:02,593
Tell me, miss...

696
01:05:02,593 --> 01:05:05,193
what is it you think you know?

697
01:05:07,293 --> 01:05:09,893
Then leave it alone.

698
01:06:24,893 --> 01:06:25,993
Anna.

699
01:06:30,893 --> 01:06:33,193
''Anna Morgan's...

700
01:06:33,193 --> 01:06:35,793
...Hallucinations''?

701
01:06:35,893 --> 01:06:37,693
What's wrong with you?

702
01:06:42,393 --> 01:06:44,693
'''65, conceived.''

703
01:06:44,693 --> 01:06:46,093
'''65, miscarriage.''

01:06:46,093 --> 01:06:47,693
'''66, conceived.''

705
01:06:47,693 --> 01:06:49,393
'''66, miscarriage.''

706
01:06:49,493 --> 01:06:52,293
Christ, she wouldn't give up.

707
01:07:23,193 --> 01:07:28,093
''Sessions terminated...
at father's request.

708

709
01:07:40,993 --> 01:07:42,993
Aidan?

710
01:07:42,993 --> 01:07:44,993
Aidan, it's your mom.

711
01:07:52,993 --> 01:07:54,993
Hi, Mom.

712
01:07:54,993 --> 01:07:57,093
Honey, the house you drew
for me...

713
01:07:57,193 --> 01:07:58,093
Uh-huh?

714
01:07:58,193 --> 01:07:59,593
...where did you see it?

715
01:07:59,593 --> 01:08:01,293
Did you see it in your head?

716
01:08:01,293 --> 01:08:02,893
Is that why you drew it?

717
01:08:02,993 --> 01:08:04,293
In my head?

718
01:08:04,293 --> 01:08:07,093
Aidan... why did you draw
that house?

719
01:08:07,193 --> 01:08:08,893
Because she told me to.

720
01:08:08,993 --> 01:08:10,193
Who?

721
01:08:10,193 --> 01:08:13,393
Who told you to?

722
01:08:13,393 --> 01:08:15,093
The little girl.

723
01:08:18,493 --> 01:08:21,993
She talks to you?

724
01:08:22,093 --> 01:08:23,993
No.

725
01:08:24,093 --> 01:08:25,993
She shows me things.

726
01:08:26,093 --> 01:08:28,693
Did she show you the horses?

727
01:08:28,693 --> 01:08:31,793
She doesn't like it in the barn.

728
01:08:31,893 --> 01:08:34,993
The horses keep her up at night.

729
01:08:35,093 --> 01:08:38,693
So, she still lives there?

730
01:08:40,693 --> 01:08:43,193
No.

731
01:08:43,193 --> 01:08:46,393
She lives in a dark place now.

732
01:09:12,693 --> 01:09:14,193
You're getting a little old

733
01:09:14,193 --> 01:09:15,893
to be crabbing out there, Cal.

734
01:09:15,993 --> 01:09:18,093
Your body's about outlived
its warranty, you know.

735
01:09:18,193 --> 01:09:20,193
You ain't exactly
the catch of the day.

736
01:09:20,193 --> 01:09:22,893
Oh... let's see you
catch one better!

737
01:09:22,993 --> 01:09:23,893
Yeah...

738
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,893
Good afternoon.

739
01:09:25,993 --> 01:09:27,893
I'm Dr. Grasnik.

740
01:09:27,993 --> 01:09:29,893
I think he was here before me.

741
01:09:29,993 --> 01:09:32,893
Darby? Darby's always here.

742
01:09:32,993 --> 01:09:34,893
Aren't you, Darby?

743
01:09:34,993 --> 01:09:36,593
He's my son's boy.

744
01:09:36,593 --> 01:09:39,293
Come over on the ferry, did you?

745
01:09:39,293 --> 01:09:40,793
Yes.

746
01:09:40,793 --> 01:09:44,493
Um... have you lived here long?

747
01:09:44,493 --> 01:09:45,493
Born and raised.

748
01:09:45,493 --> 01:09:47,093
Only doctor on the island.

749
01:09:47,093 --> 01:09:50,793
Then you know the Morgans
and their daughter.

750
01:09:50,793 --> 01:09:53,293
Do you know
their daughter?

751
01:09:53,393 --> 01:09:55,893
Do you know their daughter?

752
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:58,993
What's this about?

753
01:09:58,993 --> 01:10:00,593
Look, I'm sorry.

754
01:10:00,693 --> 01:10:02,993
I-I don't know how to say this

755
01:10:03,093 --> 01:10:06,493
but I'm seeing things
in my head-- images--

756
01:10:06,593 --> 01:10:08,493
and so is my son.

757
01:10:08,593 --> 01:10:12,193
My son, that...
that's why I'm here

758
01:10:12,193 --> 01:10:15,993
and somehow,
I don't know how, but...

759
01:10:15,993 --> 01:10:18,793
it's because of that girl.

760
01:10:22,193 --> 01:10:25,693
Haven't heard anybody say that
in a long time.

761
01:10:28,693 --> 01:10:31,093
She wanted a child
more than anything.

762
01:10:31,193 --> 01:10:32,293
Poor Anna.

763
01:10:32,293 --> 01:10:33,993
They tried hard for years

764
01:10:33,993 --> 01:10:36,593
but sometimes
it's just not meant to be.

765
01:10:36,593 --> 01:10:38,593
Then one winter, they went away.

766
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:39,893
When they came back

767
01:10:39,993 --> 01:10:41,893
it was with Samara.

768
01:10:41,993 --> 01:10:43,893
Adopted, they said.

769
01:10:43,993 --> 01:10:45,893
Never did say from where.

770
01:10:45,893 --> 01:10:49,293
Said the mother had died
of complications.

771
01:10:49,393 --> 01:10:52,093
But they had their baby,
they had their horses--

772
01:10:52,193 --> 01:10:54,193
everything was fine...

773
01:10:54,193 --> 01:10:56,593
till Anna started coming
to see me.

774
01:10:56,593 --> 01:10:58,793
Said she was
suffering visions...

775
01:10:58,893 --> 01:11:00,093
seeing things...

776
01:11:00,193 --> 01:11:02,193
horrible things...

777
01:11:02,193 --> 01:11:04,993
like they'd been burned
inside her...

778
01:11:04,993 --> 01:11:06,993
and it only happened

779
01:11:06,993 --> 01:11:08,293
around Samara...

780
01:11:08,293 --> 01:11:10,693
that the girl put them there.

781
01:11:12,693 --> 01:11:15,693
Were you Samara's
doctor, too?

782
01:11:15,693 --> 01:11:18,493
Was there anything wrong
with her?

783
01:11:18,493 --> 01:11:19,993
You mean medically?

784
01:11:19,993 --> 01:11:22,093
I mean whatever you mean.

785
01:11:24,493 --> 01:11:27,993
When Darby, there, was born...

786
01:11:27,993 --> 01:11:32,993
we knew something wasn't right
with him...

787
01:11:32,993 --> 01:11:35,993
but we loved him anyway.

788
01:11:36,093 --> 01:11:38,393
Takes work, you know.

789
01:11:38,393 --> 01:11:41,193
Some people have limits.

790
01:11:43,193 --> 01:11:46,093
So, what happened to her?

791
01:11:46,093 --> 01:11:48,793
I referred them
to Eola Psychiatric

792
01:11:48,793 --> 01:11:50,093
on the mainland.

793
01:11:50,093 --> 01:11:52,193
I assume she's still there.

794
01:11:52,193 --> 01:11:54,693
You don't know?

795
01:11:54,693 --> 01:11:58,193
How can you not know?

796
01:11:58,193 --> 01:12:00,693
We've been through...

797
01:12:00,693 --> 01:12:03,893
a lot of hard years out here...

798
01:12:03,893 --> 01:12:05,893
mean winters...

799
01:12:05,893 --> 01:12:08,993
small hauls, no fish...

800
01:12:09,093 --> 01:12:12,493
and that was long
before the horses.

801
01:12:12,493 --> 01:12:14,593
See, when you live on an island

802
01:12:14,593 --> 01:12:17,293
you catch a cold,
it's everybody's cold.

803
01:12:17,393 --> 01:12:18,493
No offense, ma'am

804
01:12:18,493 --> 01:12:20,693
but what the hell
does that mean?

805
01:12:20,793 --> 01:12:23,993
It means ever since
that girl's been gone

806
01:12:23,993 --> 01:12:25,993
things have been better.

807
01:12:28,893 --> 01:12:30,393
1978.

808
01:12:30,393 --> 01:12:32,893
Man, we're really going
back in time, here.

809
01:12:32,893 --> 01:12:35,393
Yeah, the lady at reception said
it should still be here.

810
01:12:35,393 --> 01:12:38,493
Should be. You say you're
the patient's father, right?

811
01:12:38,593 --> 01:12:40,493
Yep. Richard Morgan, that's me.

812
01:12:40,493 --> 01:12:41,893
What is your secret?

813
01:12:41,893 --> 01:12:43,793
Diet and exercise, man.

814
01:12:43,793 --> 01:12:44,793
No shit!

815
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:47,093
Yeah, that's all it takes.

816
01:12:47,093 --> 01:12:49,493
You know, I'm
not an idiot.

817
01:12:49,493 --> 01:12:51,993
You try and walk out
of here with my file

818
01:12:51,993 --> 01:12:54,393
and I'll be on you
like white on rice.

819
01:12:54,493 --> 01:12:55,593
You understand?

820
01:12:55,593 --> 01:12:56,793
No, man.

821
01:12:56,793 --> 01:12:58,893
I just want to watch it.

822
01:12:58,993 --> 01:13:01,893
I'm responsible
for every file tape in here.

823
01:13:01,993 --> 01:13:05,293
I have a system...
and I don't want anyone

824
01:13:05,293 --> 01:13:07,093
disarranging it.

825
01:13:07,193 --> 01:13:11,193
I'd never... disarrange...

826
01:13:11,193 --> 01:13:14,293
Long as we understand
each other.

827
01:13:15,693 --> 01:13:18,093
Okay, now I'm mad.

828
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:21,193
Does it say who was
the last person to watch it?

829
01:13:24,593 --> 01:13:25,693
Yeah.

830
01:13:25,693 --> 01:13:26,993
It was you.

831
01:13:28,993 --> 01:13:30,893
Come on, come on!

832
01:13:32,993 --> 01:13:35,193
The mobile unit you've called

833
01:13:35,293 --> 01:13:37,593
is not responding
or is outside the coverage area.

834
01:13:37,593 --> 01:13:39,193
You piece of shit!

835
01:13:42,693 --> 01:13:45,093
Come on, Rachel.

836
01:13:56,793 --> 01:13:58,793
Hello?

837
01:14:05,693 --> 01:14:07,693
Mr. Morgan?

838
01:14:19,793 --> 01:14:21,693
Mr. Morgan?

839
01:15:56,093 --> 01:15:59,593
This is SM0015

840
01:15:59,593 --> 01:16:02,593
Samara Morgan, hour 14.

841
01:16:06,293 --> 01:16:07,593
Good. Very good.

842
01:16:07,693 --> 01:16:11,393
So, what is it
that's keeping you awake?

843
01:16:11,393 --> 01:16:13,593
You must sleep sometime.

844
01:16:13,693 --> 01:16:16,793
Do you dream about something?

845
01:16:18,993 --> 01:16:20,993
Samara?

846
01:16:25,193 --> 01:16:27,593
Let's talk about the pictures.

847
01:16:29,593 --> 01:16:31,193
How did you make them?

848
01:16:34,693 --> 01:16:37,493
Samara?

849
01:16:37,493 --> 01:16:39,693
How did you make these pictures?

850
01:16:42,093 --> 01:16:44,493
I don't...

851
01:16:44,493 --> 01:16:46,593
make them.

852
01:16:46,693 --> 01:16:49,593
I see them...

853
01:16:49,593 --> 01:16:52,193
and then...

854
01:16:52,193 --> 01:16:55,393
they just... are.

855
01:16:55,493 --> 01:16:57,993
Samara...

856
01:16:58,093 --> 01:17:01,493
I need you to start
telling me the truth, okay?

857
01:17:01,493 --> 01:17:03,693
Can I see my mommy?

858
01:17:03,693 --> 01:17:05,293
No, Samara.

859
01:17:05,293 --> 01:17:07,793
Not until we understand
what's wrong with you.

860
01:17:09,493 --> 01:17:11,193
I love my mommy.

861
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,693
Yes, you do.

862
01:17:13,793 --> 01:17:17,893
But you don't want to hurt her
anymore, now, do you?

863
01:17:17,993 --> 01:17:20,793
You don't want to hurt anyone.

864
01:17:20,893 --> 01:17:26,293
But I do, and I'm sorry.

865
01:17:26,393 --> 01:17:28,393
It won't stop.

866
01:17:28,493 --> 01:17:30,393
Well, that's why you're here.

867
01:17:30,493 --> 01:17:33,393
So that I can help you
to make it stop.

868
01:17:35,593 --> 01:17:37,293
He's going to leave me here.

869
01:17:37,393 --> 01:17:40,293
Who?

870
01:17:40,293 --> 01:17:42,593
Daddy.

871
01:17:42,693 --> 01:17:44,793
They just want to help you.

872
01:17:44,893 --> 01:17:47,893
Not Daddy.

873
01:17:47,993 --> 01:17:50,893
Your daddy loves you.

874
01:17:50,993 --> 01:17:53,593
Daddy loves the horses.

875
01:17:55,793 --> 01:17:57,993
He wants me to go away.

876
01:17:59,693 --> 01:18:01,893
No, he doesn't.

877
01:18:01,993 --> 01:18:05,893
But he doesn't know...

878
01:18:05,893 --> 01:18:07,893
He doesn't know what?

879
01:18:07,893 --> 01:18:09,593
Samara?

880
01:18:14,093 --> 01:18:17,993
She's never gonna whisper
in my fucking ear ever again!

881
01:18:17,993 --> 01:18:20,393
What did you do to her?

882
01:18:24,793 --> 01:18:27,393
She was your daughter!

883
01:18:30,693 --> 01:18:32,993
You killed Samara,
didn't you?

884
01:18:32,993 --> 01:18:34,393
You killed her,
and when your wife--

885
01:18:34,393 --> 01:18:37,393
My wife was not supposed
to have a child!

886
01:18:45,993 --> 01:18:47,493
Mr. Morgan...

887
01:18:49,593 --> 01:18:50,493
What are you doing?

888
01:18:50,593 --> 01:18:52,493
The whispers... you could
hear them all the time.

889
01:18:52,593 --> 01:18:54,793
At night. In your sleep.

890
01:18:54,893 --> 01:18:56,493
Even the damn horses.

891
01:18:56,593 --> 01:18:58,693
Mr. Morgan, come out of there.

892
01:18:58,693 --> 01:19:00,193
And those pictures.

893
01:19:00,193 --> 01:19:01,393
Oh, Good Christ.

894
01:19:01,393 --> 01:19:02,993
The things she'd show you.

895
01:19:03,093 --> 01:19:05,293
She's still showing them.

896
01:19:05,393 --> 01:19:07,493
And she'll never stop.

897
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:10,893
You coming here proves that.

898
01:19:12,893 --> 01:19:14,793
Where is she? Please.

899
01:19:14,893 --> 01:19:16,293
I have to stop her.

900
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:18,193
If I don't, my son will die!

901
01:19:18,293 --> 01:19:20,293
Oh, yes.

902
01:19:20,393 --> 01:19:22,493
He will.

903
01:19:22,493 --> 01:19:24,493
She never sleeps.

904
01:19:24,493 --> 01:19:25,593
Wait. No...

905
01:19:26,493 --> 01:19:28,693
No!

906
01:19:31,793 --> 01:19:34,593
No!

907
01:19:34,593 --> 01:19:36,093
No!

908
01:19:36,093 --> 01:19:37,493
Rachel! Shh! Shh!

909
01:19:37,493 --> 01:19:38,793
It's all right!

910
01:19:38,793 --> 01:19:39,793
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

911
01:19:39,893 --> 01:19:40,793
It's okay. It's okay.

912
01:19:40,893 --> 01:19:42,493
You're okay.

913
01:19:42,593 --> 01:19:44,293
Shh, shh, shh!

914
01:19:44,293 --> 01:19:45,793
You're okay.

915
01:19:45,793 --> 01:19:47,293
You're okay.

916
01:19:47,293 --> 01:19:49,293
You okay?

917
01:19:57,393 --> 01:20:00,393
Oh, Jesus.

918
01:20:13,993 --> 01:20:15,793
She doesn't like the barn.

919
01:20:15,893 --> 01:20:19,793
The horses keep her up
at night.

920
01:20:26,593 --> 01:20:29,293
She doesn't like the barn.

921
01:20:29,393 --> 01:20:31,593
What?

922
01:20:31,693 --> 01:20:34,593
The horses keep her awake.

923
01:21:06,593 --> 01:21:08,593
Samara...

924
01:21:45,293 --> 01:21:46,993
He kept her here.

925
01:21:49,593 --> 01:21:53,393
Her mother was going crazy.

926
01:21:53,493 --> 01:21:56,693
Morgan blamed the child.

927
01:21:56,693 --> 01:21:58,793
So he kept her here.

928
01:22:01,593 --> 01:22:03,293
Alone.

929
01:22:03,293 --> 01:22:05,493
Not alone.

930
01:22:36,293 --> 01:22:37,293
Rachel...

931
01:22:41,793 --> 01:22:43,693
There's something under here.

932
01:22:50,893 --> 01:22:54,293
It looks like
it's etched into the wood.

933
01:22:59,793 --> 01:23:01,793
Or burned.

934
01:23:29,793 --> 01:23:32,993
I've seen this tree before.

935
01:23:33,093 --> 01:23:34,893
Yeah, it was on the tape.

936
01:23:34,893 --> 01:23:36,693
No.

937
01:23:36,793 --> 01:23:39,293
I've been there.

938
01:23:41,693 --> 01:23:44,193
Shelter Mountain.

939
01:24:14,093 --> 01:24:16,493
The sun came through the leaves,

940
01:24:16,593 --> 01:24:18,593
lit them up like it was on fire.

941
01:24:20,093 --> 01:24:22,093
Right at sunset.

942
01:24:25,793 --> 01:24:28,493
Right when I watched the tape.

943
01:24:34,193 --> 01:24:36,193
That was a week ago.

944
01:24:44,393 --> 01:24:46,693
We're back to where
we started from.

945
01:24:46,693 --> 01:24:48,393
Something led us here.

946
01:24:48,393 --> 01:24:50,193
The tree,
the drawing on the wall--

947
01:24:50,193 --> 01:24:52,093
It doesn't matter.

948
01:24:52,193 --> 01:24:54,593
We're too late.

949
01:24:57,293 --> 01:24:58,993
You have to help him.

950
01:24:58,993 --> 01:25:00,793
What are you talking about?

951
01:25:00,893 --> 01:25:02,893
Aidan.

952
01:25:02,893 --> 01:25:04,693
It's up to you now.

953
01:25:04,793 --> 01:25:06,993
Just use the time you have
and figure something out.

954
01:25:06,993 --> 01:25:08,893
We'll figure this out
together, right now!

955
01:25:08,993 --> 01:25:09,993
It's too late, Noah!

956
01:25:10,093 --> 01:25:12,493
Stop it, okay? There's a reason
that we're here!

957
01:25:12,493 --> 01:25:13,993
-What?!
-I don't know, okay?

958
01:25:13,993 --> 01:25:15,693
There's something in this room!

959
01:25:15,693 --> 01:25:17,693
I mean, it's in this phone!

960
01:25:17,693 --> 01:25:20,393
It's in this television!

961
01:25:20,393 --> 01:25:21,393
Come on!

962
01:25:21,393 --> 01:25:22,493
Tell us now, why don't you?!

963
01:25:24,593 --> 01:25:27,493
Noah...

964
01:25:27,493 --> 01:25:28,893
look.

965
01:27:09,793 --> 01:27:11,993
Aw, Jesus.

966
01:27:12,093 --> 01:27:14,493
How far down
do you think it goes?

967
01:27:14,493 --> 01:27:16,893
I can't see anything.

968
01:27:25,993 --> 01:27:28,193
We should drop something.

969
01:28:04,893 --> 01:28:06,893
Do you think
she's down there?

970
01:28:06,993 --> 01:28:08,693
Shh...

971
01:28:36,993 --> 01:28:40,593
Rachel!

972
01:29:06,593 --> 01:29:07,893
Rachel!

973
01:29:10,693 --> 01:29:13,193
Rachel!

974
01:29:13,193 --> 01:29:15,493
I'm here!

975
01:29:15,493 --> 01:29:17,893
I'm all right!

976
01:29:17,893 --> 01:29:19,693
I think.

977
01:29:19,793 --> 01:29:22,293
I'll go find something
to get you out!

978
01:29:23,393 --> 01:29:25,093
Hurry!

979
01:30:09,893 --> 01:30:11,193
Noah?

980
01:30:20,293 --> 01:30:21,593
Noah?

981
01:30:21,593 --> 01:30:22,893
Noah!

982
01:30:33,393 --> 01:30:34,293
Oh!

983
01:31:02,193 --> 01:31:06,593
Here we go

984
01:31:06,593 --> 01:31:11,493
The world is spinning

985
01:31:11,493 --> 01:31:23,693
When it stops,
it's just beginning.

986
01:31:26,493 --> 01:31:28,993
Isn't it beautiful here, Samara?

987
01:31:33,493 --> 01:31:36,193
So peaceful.

988
01:31:38,693 --> 01:31:41,893
I know things will get better.

989
01:31:51,793 --> 01:31:54,993
All I ever wanted was you.

990
01:32:36,393 --> 01:32:39,393
She was still alive.

991
01:32:44,893 --> 01:32:46,893
Where did you go?

992
01:33:16,593 --> 01:33:19,793
It's okay now.

993
01:33:19,893 --> 01:33:21,793
It's okay.

994
01:33:23,893 --> 01:33:26,093
Rachel!

995
01:33:29,993 --> 01:33:34,293
Rachel, the sun's set!

996
01:33:34,293 --> 01:33:35,493
The sun has set!

997
01:33:35,493 --> 01:33:36,793
It's past sunset.

998
01:33:36,793 --> 01:33:37,893
Do you hear me?

999
01:33:37,893 --> 01:33:40,593
It's past sunset!

1000
01:33:44,593 --> 01:33:47,393
Rachel?

1001
01:33:56,793 --> 01:33:58,793
Rachel?

1002
01:34:03,893 --> 01:34:06,793
Rachel, are you there?

1003
01:34:11,793 --> 01:34:13,493
I'm here.

1004
01:34:30,593 --> 01:34:32,893
They're going to bury her
next week.

1005
01:34:36,793 --> 01:34:38,393
It's over.

1006
01:34:45,893 --> 01:34:47,793
You okay?

1007
01:34:47,893 --> 01:34:53,493
She wanted that child
more than anything in the world.

1008
01:34:53,593 --> 01:34:56,593
How could she have done that?

1009
01:34:59,793 --> 01:35:02,793
She just wanted to be heard.

1010
01:35:06,193 --> 01:35:10,193
Sometimes children...

1011
01:35:10,193 --> 01:35:14,393
yell or cry or draw pictures.

1012
01:35:27,293 --> 01:35:29,293
I want to go home.

1013
01:35:44,393 --> 01:35:48,093
I can't imagine being stuck
down a well all alone like that.

1014
01:35:49,793 --> 01:35:52,093
How long could you survive?

1015
01:35:58,793 --> 01:36:00,293
Seven days.

1016
01:36:06,393 --> 01:36:09,893
You could survive
for seven days.

1017
01:36:39,193 --> 01:36:41,493
Come on.

1018
01:36:41,493 --> 01:36:43,393
Hey.

1019
01:37:18,893 --> 01:37:21,893
Why don't you just
call me sometime?

1020
01:37:21,893 --> 01:37:23,893
Unless you're renting a movie.

1021
01:37:26,893 --> 01:37:28,893
Call me tomorrow...

1022
01:37:32,893 --> 01:37:35,193
...and the day after that.

1023
01:38:16,593 --> 01:38:18,593
Rachel?

1024
01:38:18,693 --> 01:38:21,593
Hmm?

1025
01:38:21,693 --> 01:38:24,593
What time is it?

1026
01:38:24,693 --> 01:38:27,593
It's either really late
or really early...

1027
01:38:27,693 --> 01:38:30,993
depending on how you look at it.

1028
01:38:30,993 --> 01:38:33,493
Don't you have to be at work?

1029
01:38:33,493 --> 01:38:36,493
Not today.

1030
01:38:40,793 --> 01:38:43,793
What happened to the girl?

1031
01:38:43,893 --> 01:38:45,793
Samara?

1032
01:38:45,893 --> 01:38:47,793
Is that her name?

1033
01:38:47,893 --> 01:38:49,093
Mm-hmm.

1034
01:38:49,193 --> 01:38:51,393
Is she still in the dark place?

1035
01:38:51,393 --> 01:38:52,693
No.

1036
01:38:52,793 --> 01:38:55,493
We set her free.

1037
01:38:57,493 --> 01:38:59,393
You helped her?

1038
01:38:59,493 --> 01:39:01,093
Yeah.

1039
01:39:01,093 --> 01:39:03,093
Why did you do that?

1040
01:39:05,293 --> 01:39:06,893
What's wrong, honey?

1041
01:39:06,993 --> 01:39:08,793
You weren't supposed
to help her.

1042
01:39:08,893 --> 01:39:10,493
It's okay now.

1043
01:39:10,593 --> 01:39:13,093
She's not going to hurt you.

1044
01:39:13,093 --> 01:39:14,593
She...

1045
01:39:20,693 --> 01:39:22,293
Don't you understand, Rachel?

1046
01:39:24,393 --> 01:39:26,693
She never sleeps.

1047
01:40:24,393 --> 01:40:27,393
Pick up the phone, Noah.

1048
01:40:27,493 --> 01:40:30,693
Come on, pick up.

1049
01:41:16,993 --> 01:41:19,293
Come on, Noah!

1050
01:41:19,393 --> 01:41:21,693
Pick up the goddamn phone!

1051
01:42:26,093 --> 01:42:27,393
Come on!

1052
01:44:14,793 --> 01:44:16,493
Go to your room!

1053
01:44:16,493 --> 01:44:17,993
Now!

1054
01:44:24,693 --> 01:44:26,093
What do you want?

1055
01:44:26,093 --> 01:44:28,393
What do you want?!

1056
01:44:28,393 --> 01:44:30,393
What do you want from me?

1057
01:44:47,893 --> 01:44:50,393
Why not me?

1058
01:44:53,093 --> 01:44:55,493
What did I do that he didn't?

1059
01:45:27,393 --> 01:45:31,393
She just wanted to be heard.

1060
01:45:31,493 --> 01:45:34,693
He wants me to go away.

1061
01:45:34,793 --> 01:45:37,193
My wife was not supposed
to have a child!

1062
01:45:37,193 --> 01:45:38,693
All I ever wanted was you.

1063
01:45:38,693 --> 01:45:40,393
Don't you understand, Rachel?

1064
01:45:40,393 --> 01:45:42,293
But he doesn't know.

1065
01:45:42,393 --> 01:45:43,793
She never sleeps.

1066
01:45:43,793 --> 01:45:45,393
You take one person's tragedy

1067
01:45:45,393 --> 01:45:48,593
and force the world
to experience it.

1068
01:45:48,593 --> 01:45:50,093
You spread it like sickness.

1069
01:45:50,193 --> 01:45:52,793
You don't want to hurt anyone.

1070
01:45:52,893 --> 01:45:54,493
But I do.

1071
01:45:55,393 --> 01:45:58,693
And I'm sorry.

1072
01:45:58,793 --> 01:46:02,193
It won't stop.

1073
01:46:05,193 --> 01:46:07,693
I made a copy.

1074
01:46:09,593 --> 01:46:11,993
Push it in.

1075
01:46:12,093 --> 01:46:14,093
''Play.''

1076
01:46:14,093 --> 01:46:15,393
Push.

1077
01:46:22,893 --> 01:46:26,793
It's going to keep killing,
isn't it?

1078
01:46:26,893 --> 01:46:29,093
She'll never stop.

1079
01:46:29,093 --> 01:46:30,593
Don't worry, sweetie.

1080
01:46:30,593 --> 01:46:33,793
You're going to be okay.

1081
01:46:39,193 --> 01:46:42,793
What about the person
we show it to?

1082
01:46:42,893 --> 01:46:45,093
What happens to them?
