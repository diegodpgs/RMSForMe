1
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:15,163
I've never gone parking before.

2
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,471
I'm really not that kind of a girl.

3
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:21,503
Well, I'm not the kind of a guy
who would go with that kind of a girl.

4
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,345
Oh, that's so sweet. I think.

5
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:27,252
There's nothing to be scared of.

6
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,329
I knew this would happen if we made out!

7
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:56,842
Good shot, son.

8
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,424
General, I think he's surrendering.

9
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,461
Run! Run!

10
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,670
Fire at will!

11
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,749
Help!

12
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:39,155
Keep firing. Keep firing! Keep firing!

13
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,125
Kill every last alien!

14
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:50,063
You will all become my alien zombies.

15
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:53,834
-Command us, Master!
-Ouch, Mom!

16
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:07,117
What did I tell you
about these kind of movies?

17
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,087
It was almost over!

18
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:12,386
-Besides, they're all the same.
-That's not true.

19
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:35,145
You know, he looks just like his father.

20
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,882
Just like his father.

21
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,659
Oh, I hate the rain.

22
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,697
Raining rocks and dogs. Great!

23
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,198
Space,

24
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,296
a universe of mystery.

25
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:09,466
Well, today, the mystery will be unveiled.

26
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:15,537
Thanks to science, we now know
the universe is nearly 500 miles long

27
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,681
and it contains,
you're not going to believe this,

28
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,714
over 1,000 stars.

29
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,384
Lem, come on! Liven it up.

30
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,759
And still, the only known intelligent life

31
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:34,261
is right here on our planet.

32
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,966
No, not today! Not today! Please.

33
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,509
What was that?

34
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:47,603
That's our planet
after the attack of the Humaniacs.

35
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,740
They're gonna eat our brains for dinner!

36
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,307
Is that true?

37
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:55,411
Everybody, please, that's ridiculous.

38
00:05:55,488 --> 00:06:00,084
Totally ridiculous.
Brains for dinner? Come on!

39
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,424
Brains are for breakfast with cereal and milk.

40
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,794
Dinner is organs and eyeballs.

41
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:12,127
Okay, everyone, everyone, please, listen up.

42
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,736
We're not getting eaten

43
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:18,834
or harvested
or having our brains barbecued.

44
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:23,242
The universe isn't scary. It's really amazing.

45
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:29,911
And don't forget to pick up
your planetary yo-yos.

46
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,758
We've got one for each of you.

47
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:44,630
You're looking at the new
Junior Assistant Curator!

48
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,137
High four!

49
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,609
Well, it's part-time now
and full-time after I graduate.

50
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,303
-How did you do, Lem?
-Got the job!

51
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:53,709
Knew you would.

52
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,213
Hey, I can see my whole life.

53
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:59,183
A house, a car, two kids,
they'll grow up and have kids.

54
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,220
They'll come home to visit on holidays.

55
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:02,948
-Well?
-Got it!

56
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:06,617
Lem, congratulations on that job.

57
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,856
-I knew you could do it.
-Yeah, thanks.

58
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,823
Oh, wow!

59
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,598
-There it is. Just two more days.
-Wow.

60
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:27,645
Humaniacs III:
The Final Battle for Our World.

61
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,246
-Victory or extinction!
-Victory or extinction!

62
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:37,613
If you guys go in costume,
I'm pretending we never met.

63
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,254
Did you just say what I think you just said?

64
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,795
I'm a planetarium professional now.

65
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,855
I don't have time for kids' movies anymore.

66
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:51,663
Kids' movies?
I suppose next you'll say aliens don't exist.

67
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:52,863
Duh!

68
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:56,531
Just as I thought. You're not Lem.

69
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,476
You're an alien zombie, like in Humaniacs II.

70
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,308
Skiff, I'm not a zombie.

71
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,281
Yeah, that's what you zombies
are programmed to say.

72
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,443
Tell me something the real Lem would know.

73
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,181
Well, I know Skiff is the only nutcase

74
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:13,385
who thinks the government
is hiding all alien evidence in Base 9.

75
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,087
And you give candy to your puppy
so he'll poop jelly beans.

76
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,928
It was just an experiment.

77
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,261
With all due respect,

78
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,703
I've put in the hours
and done a lot of alien research at work.

79
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:29,764
What are you talking about?
You work in a comic book store!

80
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:33,243
The greatest source of scientific knowledge.

81
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:36,748
Skiff, time to unpack the fake alien poop.

82
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,306
Right away, Mr. Haglug.

83
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:42,547
You will believe me, Lem,
when aliens put you on the takeout menu.

84
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,515
-Wow!
-Skiff!

85
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,025
I love fake-alien-poop day.

86
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:54,762
So, Eckle, do you think your sister's home?

87
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,365
-Why?
-I thought maybe...

88
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:59,495
I thought I might tell her I got the job.

89
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,234
-Why?
-Forget it. You tell her for me. Okay?

90
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:05,402
Okay, but every time you tell me
to tell her something,

91
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,912
she asks
why don't you just tell her yourself?

92
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,504
-What?
-And then my mom says

93
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:13,712
it's because you like her,
and then she says that, "Oh, that's so cute,"

94
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,947
and why don't you just ask her out already,

95
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:18,547
'cause she's been waiting
for you to ask her out

96
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,990
ever since we moved next door to you.

97
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:25,621
She has? The girl of my dreams likes me?

98
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,730
This is the best day of my life.

99
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,291
Yeah, we got to see that kid throw up.

100
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:34,939
Hey, he did it!

101
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:38,943
-He got the job!
-We're so proud of you.

102
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:44,706
I hear it's just one easy step up
to Senior Assistant Curator.

103
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,731
Come on, soldier. Take that hill.

104
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:08,071
-Hey, Neera.
-Hey, Lem.

105
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,408
I wanted to tell you, I got the job.

106
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,775
Lem, that's great!

107
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,045
-Maybe it's time that you and me...
-Yes?

108
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,816
I mean, would you want to...

109
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:27,017
Hey, Neera!
I've been looking all over for you.

110
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:30,722
-You've been looking for me?
-The cause needs you.

111
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,225
-The what?
-The cause.

112
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,126
Glar's involved with something
he calls "protesting."

113
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,797
It's like when you shout about stuff
that makes you upset.

114
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,965
Yeah, like our school pictures.

115
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,407
Why do they have to be of our faces?

116
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,468
I mean, what a bummer.

117
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,346
That means it's not good.

118
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:51,042
Neera, we need you! Righteous momma!

119
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:56,419
I'm so honored,
but Lem was about to ask me something.

120
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,420
Yeah? Man, what do you want to ask her?

121
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:03,195
-It's kind of private.
-No problemo, man!

122
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,690
I mean, I totally respect that.

123
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,092
So, Neera...

124
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:12,467
Neera and Lem had a private conversation

125
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:16,333
And don't want anybody else around

126
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:19,572
Yeah, you know, we can talk later.

127
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:20,839
Okay.

128
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,307
Peace.

129
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,747
That means, "See you later."

130
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,618
Bye!

131
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:36,652
Bye.

132
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,130
"The cause, man."

133
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,694
I'd like to cause him some pain.

134
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,875
I don't want to hear a single bubble.

135
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,171
Especially you, Bubbles.

136
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,885
Call the General! Call the General!

137
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,459
It's in the Containment Room.
Lock this section down, now!

138
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:18,316
Resistance is futile. Surrender or die.

139
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,121
Come on, Eckle. Go help your father.

140
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,208
What the...

141
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,302
Duck?

142
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,491
Wow!

143
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,765
No! No! No! No! No!

144
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,434
Mom, Dad, there's a ship in the...

145
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,998
My car!

146
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:57,343
Open wide
or the big, bad monster will get you.

147
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:42,951
The battle for our world has begun.

148
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:46,331
-Captain, mobilize the army.
-Yes, sir!

149
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,263
Right, men, move it!

150
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:16,889
Are they hostile? Will our species survive?

151
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:19,023
One thing we do know is

152
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:22,133
that they show no respect for
our parking laws.

153
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,501
And speaking of survival,

154
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,971
how will you survive
without a sparkling smile?

155
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,634
Give your smile that special glow

156
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:33,473
Try the sparkle action of Dental Pro

157
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,549
You know,
you're really good as that toothbrush.

158
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,056
Yeah. But what I really do best
is a suppository.

159
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,927
Now, let's see. Invasion by giant ants.

160
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:58,028
Invasion by sea monsters.

161
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,504
Invasion by 50-foot woman?

162
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,269
Here it is,
So, You've Been Invaded by Aliens.

163
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,245
-Keep your eyes on the aliens.
-Aliens?

164
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:22,952
All right, class, let's try it one more time.

165
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,296
The aliens are coming!

166
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:31,593
Flarc, you were too slow.
Go join the zombies.

167
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,776
I called it. The only question is,

168
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,706
should I be terrified
because it's the end of the world

169
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,079
or happy because I totally called it?

170
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,151
Me, I have a plan.

171
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,815
They're gonna need a native
to run the mines.

172
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:55,189
I'll befriend them,
show my executive skills, and bam! I'm in.

173
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,652
Speaking of "bam! I'm in..."

174
00:19:58,397 --> 00:19:59,591
A cork?

175
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,600
It's your best defense against the aliens'
favorite form of research.

176
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,135
The probe.

177
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,802
You put it...

178
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:09,034
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think I get it.
-Oh, wait.

179
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:11,871
This is yours. I already used that one.

180
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,840
I just remembered, my job.

181
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:18,115
Gotta go. You know, my boss.

182
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:21,448
Your boss? No problem.
You guys can share.

183
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,327
Neera, you have to choose.

184
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,336
It's either me or Glar.

185
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,941
Oh, Lem, there's no question.

186
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,208
It's you, of course.

187
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,140
Come on! Come on! Come on!

188
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:33,980
Hello. This is the alien hotline.

189
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:36,282
Yes. Hi. I've found the alien.

190
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:40,519
They're here, and no weapon can stop them.

191
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:42,617
You've got to be kidding.

192
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:05,272
-Hello?
-Yes, hello. I've found the alien!

193
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,944
If you've spotted an alien fleet, dial 1.

194
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,579
For pod people, dial 2.

195
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,594
I can breathe! I can breathe!

196
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,224
You speak my language.

197
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,602
That's amazing! You speak my language.

198
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,465
Yeah. That's what I just said.

199
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,406
You just said, "That's what I just said."

200
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,106
-Say something else.
-Like what?

201
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:37,478
"Like what."
They're gonna freak back at Kennedy.

202
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:42,551
I'm Captain Charles T. Baker, astronaut.

203
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,991
As-tro-nau-t.

204
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:50,689
-Ass...
-Tro-naut.

205
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,495
Lem.

206
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,463
Lem.

207
00:23:56,668 --> 00:24:00,104
Either your name is Lem,
or you want to mate with me.

208
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,506
Houston, we have a little problem.

209
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:07,406
-What do you want?
-Thanks for asking.

210
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,813
Coffee, light, two sugars.

211
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:13,442
Do you have any Frappuccino up here?
Any puff pastry, too. Thanks.

212
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:17,147
No, I mean are you here
to take over our world

213
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:20,419
and, like, eat our brains?

214
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,186
Hold on.

215
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:25,627
What kind of sick planet is this?

216
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,761
First of all,
it's supposed to be uninhabited, okay?

217
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:31,530
Not full of sea monkeys
dancing to the oldies.

218
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:34,504
My mission was to plant Old Glory,
whack a few golf balls

219
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:38,236
and head back to the Kids' Choice Awards.
I'm getting slimed.

220
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,642
-What?
-You were just talking alien.

221
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:44,011
Hey, I'm not the alien here. You are.

222
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,516
-Me? You are.
-No, you are.

223
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,951
You are. You... You came to my planet.

224
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,619
An alien planet. Hello.

225
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,819
-Hello.
-Not, "Hello." "Hello!"

226
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:57,759
-Hello... What?
-What?

227
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,761
Let's start over.

228
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,700
Look, there's a command module
in orbit right now.

229
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:05,793
It's running out of fuel.

230
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:08,965
It has to leave in 74 hours,
and if I'm not on it,

231
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,203
it goes back to Earth without me. Capisce?

232
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:16,477
I have to get to my ship
and go back up in space.

233
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:18,814
Can you help me?

234
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:21,910
You want me to take you
to your flying saucer? No!

235
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:24,615
If they catch me helping you,
who knows what they'll do to me?

236
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,954
I'll lose everything.
My life was just getting perfect.

237
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,392
Kid... You are a kid, right?

238
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:33,124
I mean, you're not like
a thousand-year-old Yoda or anything?

239
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,167
Never mind. Look, kid, you're my only hope.

240
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:40,265
But I suppose you could leave me stranded.

241
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:44,001
My wife will have to support the kids.

242
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:48,140
Eleven. We have 11 kids, always hungry.

243
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:51,009
Yeah. Yeah.
But, hey, they'll get by without a father.

244
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:54,848
The important thing here
is you avoid a little trouble.

245
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:58,718
Alien hotline.
What's the nature of your sighting?

246
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:02,325
Hello? Are you there?

247
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:06,361
Hello? Are you there?

248
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:16,332
Hey, fella. Who wants a donut?

249
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:27,841
Silly dog!

250
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,635
There's your flying saucer. Now what?

251
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:55,942
Okay, here's the plan.

252
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:00,547
You knock out that cop,
then you overpower those two.

253
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,847
You neutralize that one

254
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,717
and handcuff the big guy
to the steering wheel.

255
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,484
That's your plan?
What if they start shooting?

256
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,220
You're one of their own.
They'll probably just aim for your legs.

257
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,728
-My legs?
-Don't your legs grow back?

258
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,594
No. We're not like your kind, okay?

259
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,401
I'll tell you what, eat this.

260
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,303
-You become invincible.
-Oh, good. Then you do it.

261
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:24,809
I can't be seen breaking the law.
I've got the right stuff.

262
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,943
-The what?
-The right stuff.

263
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:28,980
It means I have a lot of courage.

264
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,275
Now go!

265
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,612
Go on! Go! Go! Go!

266
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,984
Hey, Lem, something wrong?

267
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,090
Left flank. Move it! Move it!

268
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:51,192
As you can see,
the army is taking positions,

269
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,499
just like in The War of the Worlds,

270
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:59,339
getting ready for our first close encounter
with invaders from outer space.

271
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,520
Attention!

272
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,662
So they've come.

273
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,760
-Captain!
-Sir.

274
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,901
Have your men search the flying saucer.

275
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:31,965
Yes, sir! Move!

276
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,943
-Hazmat team, go!
-Sir!

277
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:38,573
Now our brave soldiers
are entering the alien spaceship.

278
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:42,076
It doesn't look big enough
to be a space destroyer.

279
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:43,313
It's dark in here.

280
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,023
Hey, look!

281
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:49,053
No sign of the pilot, sir.

282
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:13,745
Are you getting...

283
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,823
I've never seen such a heinous weapon.

284
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,925
We are up against a cruel, sadistic enemy.

285
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:32,231
Seal off the town.
I want that alien pilot found.

286
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,095
I protest!

287
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:39,800
They're bumming me out
with their bad vibrations

288
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,807
Well, there's one thing you've gotta do...

289
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:45,907
Never mind, Captain. The alien is right here.

290
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:48,009
-Grab him!
-Yes, sir!

291
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:50,317
Glar's not the alien!

292
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:52,948
Oh, no? Then what do you call this?

293
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:56,524
-Hair. He likes it long.
-Very unusual.

294
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:59,861
You might even say, very alien!

295
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:04,362
Excuse me! General!
He does go to the high school.

296
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:09,267
Glar's just trying to say
the aliens might be friendly.

297
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:16,903
Lem! Lem, you know astronomy.

298
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:20,277
If an alien came all this way,

299
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:23,653
wouldn't it be smart enough
to come in peace?

300
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,256
No! No! No! No! No!

301
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:39,961
I mean, they've come to harvest our organs,
make us slaves.

302
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:41,564
Me?

303
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,467
We should all, all of us,
right now, go home and hide.

304
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,313
That's a sensible young man. Let him go.

305
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:54,545
And the rest of you,
go to your homes and wait for instructions.

306
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,317
Hi.

307
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:02,558
Go back to your homes. Show's over.

308
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:25,606
Okay, come on, come on.

309
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,348
Hurry up. Go! Go! Go! Go!

310
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:32,588
Great! Just great!

311
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:35,751
Look, I said I'd take you
to your flying saucer, okay?

312
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:38,489
Well, there it is. Now, leave.

313
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:44,696
I'll get you a blanket and a pillow
for the night.

314
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:02,880
It's a miracle I'm gonna need.

315
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:29,506
Oh, you... You like the stone?
You like the stone?

316
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,548
Go! Go! Go get it!

317
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,220
There it is! Stop!

318
00:32:58,609 --> 00:32:59,974
Don't move!

319
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:43,278
Aliens are quite like us,
except they have two sets of teeth,

320
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:43,888
hypodermic fingertips and hypnotic eyes
to control our brains

321
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:48,621
hypodermic fingertips and hypnotic eyes
to control our brains

322
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:52,424
and turn us into an army of zombies
and destroy our world.

323
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:53,521
What?

324
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:58,501
Remember, anyone caught
helping the aliens will go to jail.

325
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:02,369
Jail? This is great!

326
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:04,833
Yesterday, my life was perfect,

327
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:09,505
and now, I'm the most wanted
super-criminal in the world.

328
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,074
At least you have a world.

329
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,410
I'll probably never see mine again.

330
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:50,544
Our preliminary procedures
have been completed, sir.

331
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:52,179
The spacecraft is quarantined.

332
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:55,851
We're looking for a place
for your headquarters, sir, and...

333
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,395
Still no trace of the alien, sir.

334
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:01,364
Where would you hide if you were an alien?

335
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,696
Hide? Bravo, General.

336
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:09,206
An alien invader spends over $500
to fly across the universe to hide.

337
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,934
You clown!
He's here to take over our minds!

338
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:18,279
-Even yours!
-Diabolical!

339
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:20,442
Captain, place me under arrest.

340
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:21,678
Not so fast, General.

341
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:25,950
I've trained my superior intellect
to recognize alien mind slaves.

342
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:31,158
You're clean.

343
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:35,325
But he's a zombie, and those two.

344
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:39,493
How will we know who is a zombie?

345
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,300
Well, zombies don't feel any pain.

346
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,001
-You're clean.
-You, too.

347
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:52,407
General, you must capture the alien alive
and bring it to me.

348
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:57,052
I will unlock the secrets
of its marvelous brain.

349
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,418
Captain, search the town.

350
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,017
Go door to door if you must,
but find that alien.

351
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:18,232
Hello, Plark, if that really is you.

352
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:22,870
Have a nice day, Serbok,
or should I call you by your alien name?

353
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,584
It's you. It's you!

354
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:29,711
It's you!

355
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:34,281
How come I have to go to the dentist
if it's the end of the world, Mom?

356
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,553
Invasion or not, you've got to go.

357
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:39,187
My mom's a zombie! Help!

358
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,035
Zombie!

359
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,707
Okay, right, so,
this is the last street we're gonna do today.

360
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:18,362
-Okay, let's start at this end.
-Wait. I think I'm a zombie.

361
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:22,634
I'm hearing an irritating, piercing voice
in the back of my head.

362
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:24,402
-Oh, shut up. It's me.
-It's there again!

363
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:26,238
It's me, you moron.

364
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,611
Hey, what's that?

365
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,226
Hey, look.

366
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:48,463
That's funny!

367
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:55,367
Look at it! Look at the dog!

368
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:58,035
Mom?

369
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:03,010
Mom? Mom! Don't come in!

370
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,748
Rover? Boy, am I glad to see you! Rover!

371
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,692
Rover?

372
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:20,522
He's a probe we sent
to take pictures of your world.

373
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:25,467
Hey, a planet full of aliens,
and you sent back pictures of rocks?

374
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,897
Bad boy! Bad boy.

375
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:32,702
-Mom, don't come in!
-The alien!

376
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:36,141
Can I get your autograph?

377
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:39,011
Eckle, this isn't a comic book, okay?
It's serious.

378
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:42,450
I don't mind.
It comes with being a national hero.

379
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:48,991
And... And my Humaniacs poster?

380
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:52,456
And my... And my chest?

381
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:56,490
Hey, how about a snapshot?

382
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,158
Get one of me looking up at the stars.

383
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:01,204
-Mom!
-I saw the alien last night.

384
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,572
I am so in.

385
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:06,701
I got this guy wrapped around
my little finger.

386
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:09,913
Let me tell you, this alien's not so scary.

387
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:16,681
Your personal chef reporting for duty, sir.

388
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:19,416
May I give you some
tasty suggestions for tonight?

389
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,687
I've got a list of
the fattest teachers in my school

390
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,625
in case you're looking for a light snack.

391
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,425
Skiff, stop.
He's not here to eat us or anything.

392
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:29,762
He's harmless to everyone but me.

393
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:31,802
Better let me do the talking.

394
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,599
I think he's eyeing you for dessert.

395
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,907
It's kind of cute, the way he does that.

396
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:43,605
Oh, great. Let's just have a party!

397
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,518
We're doing a routine search for the alien.

398
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:51,683
Don't shoot! Don't shoot.

399
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,414
It's trying to control our minds.

400
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,960
-What do we do?
-Don't look in its eyes.

401
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:59,461
That's how they take over your brain.

402
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,055
Brains? That's right, brains!

403
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:06,128
You are my zombie slaves.

404
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:10,300
-I want to control your brains.
-It's inside my head!

405
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:12,899
Its will is too strong!

406
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,651
Hey, Macarena

407
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:24,517
-Command us, Master.
-Command us, Master.

408
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:28,655
-Command me, too.
-It's not real.

409
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:31,327
I think I know
when I'm being mind-controlled.

410
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:34,592
Hey, maybe they could get me on my ship.

411
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:40,060
I'm leaning toward "probably not."

412
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:44,702
...an extensive search.

413
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,970
-But I think I know who can.
-In the meantime at the landing site,

414
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:51,071
just to the left of me here,
everything is checked and double-checked.

415
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:53,742
The High Command
taking control of the situation...

416
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:57,115
You want our home for your headquarters?

417
00:40:57,555 --> 00:41:00,649
Gee, that would be a great honor.

418
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,886
Honey, tell Lem we have guests.

419
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:08,163
Lem, there's someone you'd like to...

420
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:19,042
Check the papers.

421
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:21,475
Kiss the ship goodbye, Rover.

422
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,976
You really think you can get me on TV?

423
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:31,154
You're the biggest story in history.

424
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:34,055
-The whole planet will watch.
-The whole planet?

425
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:35,614
Interesting.

426
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:39,258
I left my hair products on the ship,
but I could improvise.

427
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,629
You know, astronauts have to deal
with any kind of emergency.

428
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,794
I get it. He can tell everyone he's peaceful.

429
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,668
All we need is a safe place, that TV reporter,

430
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:51,105
and then we can all get on with our lives.

431
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,700
Skiff, the comic book store, let's go there.

432
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:57,873
Okay, but if he's not housebroken,
you're cleaning up his mess.

433
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:00,443
We need a slogan, like something that says,

434
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:04,511
"It's a bummer to make war on the aliens
when we should make..."

435
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,719
Hey, Neera! Hi! Hi!

436
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,885
Kill any aliens, Lem?

437
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:14,124
Oh, no, you don't understand.
These soldiers aren't...

438
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,666
Oh, great! This day gets better and better.

439
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,471
General Grawl,
you better take a look at this.

440
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:33,373
Professor, take a look.

441
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:37,081
This is obviously alien writing.

442
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:43,249
It says, "Surrender or die,"

443
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:47,593
and this is a list of surrender terms.

444
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,128
Diabolical.

445
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:53,194
What are you doing in Lem's room?

446
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:57,104
I'm afraid your son is a zombie.

447
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,643
-Hey, kid, what's bugging you?
-Neera.

448
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:08,116
-What is that, like an alien hernia?
-Well, sort of.

449
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:12,918
It's the girl of my dreams,
and now she hates me.

450
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:17,423
Hate's a strong word.
Maybe she just dislikes you.

451
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:20,860
Plus, there's another guy, Glar.

452
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:23,028
Okay. You know your problem?

453
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,763
It's not Glar or Neera. It's Lem.

454
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:29,695
Look at you. You're so left-brain.

455
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,741
Or is it right brain? Whatever.

456
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:35,267
You're like the chief of control.
You've got to loosen up.

457
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:38,713
We've got a little time.
You, my friend, are in luck.

458
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:41,307
The doctor is in.

459
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,555
Me and green bean need to talk.

460
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:53,520
Before we begin, I have a technical question.

461
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:56,896
Are you considered
very ugly on this planet?

462
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,764
-What?
-Because I can't tell.

463
00:43:58,836 --> 00:43:59,894
No.

464
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:03,235
-I mean, I'm okay.
-Oh, good. Good.

465
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,008
Why do chicks dig me?

466
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:11,536
Because I'm handsome?
Because I'm an astronaut?

467
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:15,442
Yes, and yes.

468
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:19,751
But it's also because
of Chuck Baker's three steps to romance.

469
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:21,652
Spot your prey.

470
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:24,785
Make your move. Show no mercy.

471
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,263
Hey, baby.

472
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:32,227
I saw you across the bar.

473
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:36,602
Are sparks flying or is this place on fire?

474
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,841
-You're sure you're not ugly, right?
-I think so.

475
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:44,711
Baby, tomorrow I go up in space,
maybe never to return.

476
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:52,054
Let's make our last night
a night to remember.

477
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:56,150
Lem! The cork!

478
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:58,918
The cork! Remember the plan!

479
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:03,690
The only plan here is to get Chuck on TV.

480
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:07,862
I'll be right back with the reporter.
I'm leaving you in charge.

481
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:09,462
In charge?

482
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:12,974
You heard him.

483
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,375
Things are going to be
different around here.

484
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:17,437
My wish is your command.

485
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:23,147
Come on, boys, let's track down this story.

486
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,916
We need an alien for the 6:00 news.

487
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,818
Wait! Stop! Hey!

488
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:33,586
-We're really upset!
-Yeah.

489
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:36,098
-Upset we really are.
-Yeah.

490
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:38,361
Are we upset, really?

491
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:42,131
Neera! I need to talk to you.

492
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:44,804
I thought you were after the alien.

493
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:47,742
-That's not what's going on.
-Then what is?

494
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:49,270
I...

495
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:51,908
Mysterious Lem

496
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:56,411
Tell us the secrets of your heart

497
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:00,790
I can't say.

498
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:04,089
Lem, I always thought we'd be together,

499
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:07,892
but I need someone who doesn't
always believe what he's been told.

500
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:14,367
It's like Glar says,
"The times, they are a-different."

501
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,769
Maybe you should go.

502
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:27,049
-Hey, baby.
-What?

503
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:29,017
Is this place sparking

504
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:34,046
or is fire making this a night
to show no mercy?

505
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:37,319
Did I happen to mention I'm not ugly?

506
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:40,554
Are you crazy?

507
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:51,065
Hey, is this guy giving you bad vibrations?

508
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,471
Lem was just leaving.

509
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:58,244
I'm hungry, guys.

510
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:06,415
Are you kidding me?

511
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,288
If you have to do a number one,
use these papers.

512
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,089
If you have to do a number two, go outside.

513
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:15,859
And, if it's number three, I can't help you.

514
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:21,030
Got you, alien! Victory or extinction!

515
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:26,504
Oh, yeah?
In space, no one can hear you scream!

516
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:30,241
-You missed!
-Crush, kill, destroy.

517
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,581
Crush, kill, destroy.

518
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:35,741
Hey, Master! We want to be destroyed, too!

519
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:40,680
Quick, cover the camera!

520
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:44,124
If it gets damaged again,
we'll have to pay for it.

521
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:00,533
You're afraid of a widdle storm.
It's nothing. You see?

522
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:07,945
Rover!

523
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:21,826
Rover!

524
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:26,393
Sit, Rover! Sit! Stop!
Heel! Roll over! Come back! Listen...

525
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,802
You can't escape the tractor beam.

526
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:31,636
It's pulling you to your doom!

527
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:42,383
6:00 news, here we go.

528
00:48:50,794 --> 00:48:52,989
...going on a journey.

529
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:55,822
Soon, we will crush the rebel alliance

530
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:58,390
and control the galaxy.

531
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,469
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

532
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:06,441
You are a rebel spy
and a traitor to the Empire.

533
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,642
Take her away.

534
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:09,906
Skiff!

535
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:16,677
Hasta la vista, baby. You are terminated.

536
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:20,212
General, over there.
Aren't those comic books?

537
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,949
Captain, get your men!

538
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:26,128
We gotta get out of here now!

539
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:32,160
Move it! Move it! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

540
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,697
Chuck, come on!

541
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,135
-Sorry, pal. Too dangerous.
-But...

542
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:40,369
Out!

543
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:43,505
You there! Stop!

544
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:49,819
Don't lose him, sir!

545
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:52,410
Wow!

546
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:03,632
Don't you ever run off like that.

547
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:06,396
What if they took you to the pound?

548
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:08,495
How would I find you?

549
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:10,432
Lem?

550
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:15,210
Oh, boy!

551
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:28,319
We'd better run!

552
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:32,593
Let's move!

553
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:38,400
Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!

554
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:42,736
Move it! Move it! Move it! Go!

555
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,410
Let the doctor handle this.

556
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:56,213
Ladies, who wants to meet an astronaut?

557
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,255
-Ladies! One at a time!
-Chuck!

558
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,886
I'm on Facebook.

559
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,200
Ready?

560
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:21,710
Look out! The monster!

561
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:28,345
It's getting away!

562
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:34,120
-Got you!
-Rover? No!

563
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:41,590
-Quick, hotwire the car!
-What? Hotwire the who?

564
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:44,725
When are you green goobers
going to evolve?

565
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:15,061
-Attention, all personnel.
-What's the matter?

566
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,327
Why did he do it?

567
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,496
I was gonna teach him to beg
and everything.

568
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:30,737
Amazing! The alien's brain is so powerful,
it's controlling them even now.

569
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:33,646
What is it telling you to do?

570
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:38,619
I think I'm supposed to dig a hive
for the alien queen.

571
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:41,156
Yeah. I'm supposed to blow up things.

572
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:43,988
-I mean, unless you need help with the hive.
-Oh, no, I'm good.

573
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,322
-You sure?
-I'm good.

574
00:52:45,395 --> 00:52:47,659
Never mind them, Professor.

575
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:50,865
This thing has all the answers.

576
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:55,335
Where's your master? Talk!

577
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:02,575
The flying saucer
is going to an undisclosed location

578
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:04,841
to be taken apart and studied.

579
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:09,318
This reporter is now going to reveal
to you where that location is.

580
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:13,417
This reporter has just been told
that if I do that,

581
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,355
I will be taken apart and studied.

582
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:28,069
Oh, look. That's perfect. That's great.

583
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:30,402
Oh, just great! Perfect!

584
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:34,135
John Glenn goes around the world,
he's a senator for life.

585
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,441
I went across the fricking universe!

586
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:38,572
I should be governor, minimum!

587
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:42,812
But, no,
I'm marooned here on this stupid rock!

588
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:50,882
This stupid rock is my home,

589
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:54,624
or it was until you came along
and ruined everything!

590
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:57,531
I want my life back, unless, I don't know,

591
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:59,762
maybe there's something else
you want to ruin.

592
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:01,326
Who's that?

593
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,871
My boss.

594
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:11,909
Sorry, Mr. Hucklo.
It's just for one little night.

595
00:54:11,982 --> 00:54:16,009
Maybe a week. I really hope this
doesn't affect our working relationship.

596
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:28,096
Oh, great! Just great! Fired.

597
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:32,724
Say, why don't you just harvest my organs
and get it over with?

598
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:42,810
Oh, great. Now look what you did.
You made him really upset.

599
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:46,574
Lem?

600
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:01,557
Lem?

601
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,706
You're looking right at my home.

602
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:15,135
See that star, the little red one?

603
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,641
Circling that star is a planet called Earth.

604
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:22,617
It's about 20 billion miles away, give or take.

605
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:24,381
There's no way space is that big.

606
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:26,479
What? Are you kidding?

607
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:31,960
There's billions of galaxies,
and each galaxy has billions of stars.

608
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:37,732
Next to that, kid,
our planets are just dust in the wind.

609
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:42,028
So, nothing I knew was right?

610
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:45,839
Come on. You knew about Neera.

611
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:47,968
I mean, look at her.

612
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:51,775
Lose the antennae,
get some plastic surgery, she's a hottie.

613
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:54,844
I don't have the right stuff, like you.

614
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:00,182
Kid...

615
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:04,886
I never had the right stuff.

616
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:11,157
I'm a button pusher, Spam in a can.

617
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:15,465
I don't even fly the ship. It's all automatic.

618
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:20,441
I only got this far on charm
and my rugged good looks.

619
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:26,512
You risked everything
to help a stranger from another world.

620
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,580
You're the one with the right stuff.

621
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,216
Get out of here.

622
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,660
Finally! We've been looking for you!

623
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:40,923
Guys!

624
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:44,598
Great hiding spot. I call the closet.

625
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:47,602
No way! Let's go fight the army.

626
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:51,197
How's your species at hiding?
Can you change your skin to this color?

627
00:56:51,274 --> 00:56:55,335
Your call, Captain Baker.
What's it going to be, fight or hide?

628
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:57,509
Neither.

629
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:00,144
I think Lem's saying he wants the closet.

630
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:04,516
I'll tell you what it's going to be.
We're gonna go get Chuck back to his ship.

631
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:07,988
Skiff, you were right about Base 9.
That's where they have his ship.

632
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:11,549
-But we don't know where it is.
-Yes, we do.

633
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:15,894
Rover found me.
He's also programmed to find my ship.

634
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:18,734
Wait, where is Rover?

635
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:24,330
-It's too painful to talk about.
-It's okay.

636
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:27,105
They've got him at the comic book shop.

637
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:29,805
Well, then, we've got to go get him.

638
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:32,780
Hold on.
The whole army's looking for you two.

639
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:34,874
You can't just stroll through town.

640
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:40,549
Wait, wait, that new movie,
doesn't that open tonight?

641
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:42,791
Yeah. Why?

642
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:59,371
The citizens of Glipforg
are undaunted by alien invaders

643
00:57:59,442 --> 00:58:02,878
and are bravely going about
their normal routines.

644
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:05,509
Got you!

645
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:09,816
There's the comic book store. Let's go.

646
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:22,488
What great costumes!

647
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:25,591
You two are finalists. Up on stage.

648
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:28,501
We're not here to enter the contest.

649
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:31,700
Then why are you dressed like aliens?

650
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:36,270
We're here to win the contest.

651
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,507
-What?
-Yeah, good.

652
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:40,208
Trust me. Trust me.

653
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:53,561
Private, come here.

654
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:04,169
Hold your fire, soldier.

655
00:59:04,607 --> 00:59:06,598
Take us to your leader.

656
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:12,481
Welcome to
the Humaniacs III Costume Contest.

657
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:23,756
We're really upset! We're really upset!

658
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:26,961
Let's hear it for the finalists.

659
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:29,525
What are we supposed to do?

660
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:32,830
Give them their daily
minimum dose of Chuck.

661
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:35,429
Hello, Humaniacs!

662
00:59:56,693 --> 00:59:58,786
Come on, Lem!

663
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:12,467
Look at me. Watch this.

664
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:20,410
Yeah! That's it!

665
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,052
Bust a move, green machine.

666
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:44,866
All right!

667
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:54,282
The alien!

668
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:07,991
Lem!

669
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:10,394
Over here!

670
01:01:11,267 --> 01:01:12,791
There he is!

671
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:21,673
All of these costumes!
Sir, how do we find the alien?

672
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:25,009
Simple, Captain.
Like us, the alien is in uniform.

673
01:01:26,582 --> 01:01:28,106
Grab him!

674
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,311
-I got you!
-Chuck!

675
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:33,016
No! No! Get off!

676
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:36,620
Okay, keep back.

677
01:01:43,633 --> 01:01:44,861
Move.

678
01:01:51,974 --> 01:01:55,102
Time to meet the monster face to face.

679
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:06,012
Look at it, Professor. It's hideous.
And that smell...

680
01:02:06,589 --> 01:02:09,854
Hey, you try wearing
the same suit for three weeks.

681
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:14,252
What a remarkable brain you must have.

682
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:18,994
An incision here and here,
it should pop right out.

683
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:25,507
No! You're making a mistake! He's friendly!

684
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:28,471
This poor boy's obviously a zombie.

685
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:31,012
-I'll remove his brain, too.
-What?

686
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:47,361
You are no longer needed, slave.

687
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:51,830
I release you. Return to your puny life.

688
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:55,032
Kid, I'm going down anyway.

689
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:58,602
There's no need for you to come with me.

690
01:02:59,742 --> 01:03:01,733
Thanks for everything.

691
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:06,638
How about it, Professor?

692
01:03:07,683 --> 01:03:09,446
Difficult to tell.

693
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,756
Do you still believe the alien is friendly?

694
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:21,828
-No.
-This boy is free!

695
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:27,832
Oh, Lem! We're so glad you're not a zombie!

696
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:30,703
What about the alien spawn, sir?

697
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:34,598
I want it destroyed, one little piece at a time.

698
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:43,509
All right, let's get these aliens to Base 9!

699
01:03:45,555 --> 01:03:47,455
Not that it exists.

700
01:03:56,432 --> 01:03:57,763
Move it!

701
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:01,066
Go on.

702
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,570
Get in!

703
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:23,889
We're here to honor
a young man who survived

704
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,896
a harrowing ordeal at the hands
of the alien monster.

705
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:30,094
Lem, come on out!

706
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:32,725
Son?

707
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:43,074
Lem, I understand you'll be working
right here after you graduate,

708
01:04:43,145 --> 01:04:45,841
teaching about the mysteries of space.

709
01:04:45,915 --> 01:04:48,748
Give us a preview of what we'll learn.

710
01:04:52,188 --> 01:04:55,419
Well, we know everything
about our universe.

711
01:04:56,125 --> 01:05:00,323
-It's 500 miles long
-500 miles!

712
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:05,867
-Remarkable!
-I can't.

713
01:05:06,802 --> 01:05:10,636
Space isn't 500 miles. It's not.

714
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:13,539
It's so much bigger than we can imagine.

715
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:18,714
There's billions of galaxies,
and each galaxy has billions of stars,

716
01:05:18,781 --> 01:05:21,614
and next to that, our planet is just...

717
01:05:23,786 --> 01:05:25,219
Excuse me.

718
01:05:39,802 --> 01:05:40,962
Lem?

719
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:46,438
I know I was kind of harsh. I'm really sorry.

720
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:50,769
Oh, hi, Neera.

721
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:53,977
-What are you doing?
-It's called hotwiring.

722
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:56,575
It's how they start cars on Earth.

723
01:05:56,652 --> 01:05:59,815
Lem, I was thinking...

724
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:03,884
Well, you know, now that this is all over...

725
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,986
-Yeah, Neera?
-Maybe we could...

726
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:13,193
Lem, you left everyone hanging!

727
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:17,101
-I'm going to go find Chuck.
-But how?

728
01:06:17,173 --> 01:06:20,700
-It's impossible without Rover!
-My little Rovie.

729
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:26,747
I can still hear his wagging little antenna.

730
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:28,673
Rover?

731
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:30,375
Rover!

732
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:34,716
Rover! Rover!

733
01:06:35,591 --> 01:06:36,751
You're alive!

734
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:39,021
But how did you get out?

735
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:44,924
Good going, boy!

736
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:48,232
Rover, Rover, can you find Chuck?
Where's Chuck?

737
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:05,219
You're going with me?

738
01:07:07,723 --> 01:07:09,190
All right!

739
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,508
Thought you could take over our world?

740
01:07:26,575 --> 01:07:28,770
Your kind knows no decency.

741
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:33,212
-You mean chick magnets?
-No, aliens.

742
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:35,940
Tell us your invasion plans.

743
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:38,782
And don't bother taking over my mind.

744
01:07:38,854 --> 01:07:41,948
If you do,
Captain Kisno has orders to shoot me.

745
01:07:42,324 --> 01:07:44,087
If you take over Captain Kisno's mind,

746
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,287
Lieutenant Groit has orders to shoot him.

747
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:47,852
If you take over Lieutenant Groit's mind,

748
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:51,388
Sergeant York will shoot Captain Kisno,
Lieutenant Groit and myself,

749
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:53,230
along with these three soldiers.

750
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:55,964
Each man has a designated target
in the squad.

751
01:07:56,038 --> 01:07:58,632
Should you succeed
in taking over all our minds,

752
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:02,541
Corporal Hisk has orders
to electrocute everyone.

753
01:08:02,611 --> 01:08:07,913
If this fails, the entire base is rigged to blow
at the touch of a button.

754
01:08:07,983 --> 01:08:11,180
General, sir? Am I supposed to shoot
Hecknavar or Kolski?

755
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:13,517
-I shoot Kolski.
-No. You shoot Meckavoy.

756
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:16,149
-Well, then who shoots Kolski?
-I can shoot myself.

757
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:18,989
That won't be necessary.
Hecknavar, you shoot Kolski,

758
01:08:19,061 --> 01:08:21,461
Captain Kisno and graze Corporal Hisk.

759
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:22,827
Yes, sir!

760
01:08:22,898 --> 01:08:24,263
Not yet!

761
01:08:25,734 --> 01:08:26,962
-Drop your weapon!
-You.

762
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:28,025
No! You first.

763
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,572
-You're mine, Hecknavar!
-I'm not taking my eyes off Kisno.

764
01:08:30,639 --> 01:08:32,368
Drop it, dirtbag!

765
01:08:43,752 --> 01:08:45,379
Hold your fire!

766
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:58,559
Hold your fire!

767
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:04,872
Captain Kisno, get everyone out of here.

768
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:09,674
You're not thinking
all this is my fault, right?

769
01:09:09,745 --> 01:09:12,145
All right, if you won't tell us,

770
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:15,276
there's another way
to unlock the secrets of your brain.

771
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:17,182
Professor Kipple!

772
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:21,114
He's all yours.

773
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:58,486
He thinks we've found him.

774
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:06,263
Hang on, Chuck. We'll find you.

775
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:21,611
There you are.
I was just warming up for you.

776
01:10:22,785 --> 01:10:25,015
Now, we'll have that brain out in no time.

777
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:27,555
You don't want my brain. It's useless.

778
01:10:27,623 --> 01:10:32,356
I spent four years at a party school.
Trust me, it's mush.

779
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:38,863
Hello? Anyone here?

780
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:48,438
-Skiff, what are you doing?
-Come on. No one's around.

781
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:50,774
I'm not going to get caught.

782
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:09,329
Hey! Look, look, look.
I'm paying! I'm paying!

783
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:29,416
The thing with the...

784
01:11:29,485 --> 01:11:33,216
I mean, it just went over the... Wow!

785
01:11:59,848 --> 01:12:01,110
Base 9.

786
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:04,884
This is amazing! I was right again!

787
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:12,320
How do we get in without being seen?

788
01:12:26,909 --> 01:12:31,039
Well, I tried to get along
tried to play along happily

789
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:35,745
But I'm sorry, Officer
Your rules ain't no good for me

790
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:41,382
There's one thing you've got to do
And that's stick it to the man

791
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:43,891
Stick it to the, stick it to the...

792
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:45,551
Stick it to...

793
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:50,562
Now!

794
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:55,529
Cool.

795
01:12:58,907 --> 01:13:01,876
I don't suppose
your planet's invented painkillers?

796
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:53,824
Yeah! Good work, Rover!

797
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:04,336
Guys! This is so Luke Skywalker!

798
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:08,743
By the way,
you're not brother and sister, right?

799
01:14:08,811 --> 01:14:11,974
-How much time is left?
-Just enough.

800
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:14,982
Rover here will take us right to my ship.

801
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,815
That's a funny place for his antenna.

802
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:24,323
Captain, I want the whole base on red alert!

803
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:25,758
Yes, sir!

804
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:28,194
General, you must save its brain!

805
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:31,061
I'm more concerned with saving a world.

806
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:57,953
That professor's a genius.

807
01:14:58,227 --> 01:15:01,663
I feel positively effervescent.

808
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:04,426
In fine fettle. What a salubrious experience!

809
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,629
Well said. Cheers!

810
01:15:34,396 --> 01:15:35,624
My ship!

811
01:15:36,164 --> 01:15:37,825
Way to go, kid!

812
01:15:44,773 --> 01:15:47,173
Step away from the flying saucer!

813
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:51,175
And put your hands in the air.

814
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,292
There was never a chance you'd get away.

815
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:15,462
You'd destroy the whole base
just to get me?

816
01:16:15,537 --> 01:16:18,870
-That is sick!
-Actually, it's kind of flattering.

817
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:22,707
Sick? Sick, young lady, is helping
the enemy of your world.

818
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:27,442
Sick is befriending a creature
that's so completely different.

819
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:31,747
Sick is... Well, look, it's right in front of you!

820
01:16:32,788 --> 01:16:37,555
I'm sorry, Professor. It's too dangerous
to let the alien live another minute.

821
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:42,992
Wait! Wait! Wait! Stop!

822
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:48,962
General, I know what you're afraid of,
and it's not Chuck.

823
01:16:49,471 --> 01:16:52,406
It's not monsters or aliens.

824
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:55,068
It's the unknown.

825
01:16:56,178 --> 01:17:01,946
I've spent my whole life running from it,
and I think maybe you have, too,

826
01:17:03,018 --> 01:17:07,352
but I'm telling you,
the unknown isn't something to be afraid of.

827
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:10,216
It can be your best friend.

828
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:14,194
And just when you think that it means
the end of everything you know,

829
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:17,832
it's really just the beginning.

830
01:17:20,335 --> 01:17:23,736
Base destruct, two minutes.

831
01:17:25,374 --> 01:17:27,706
What are you looking at? Run!

832
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:36,573
Take that!

833
01:17:45,193 --> 01:17:47,161
Everyone on board! Let's go!

834
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:51,928
Attention, all personnel.
Evacuate base immediately.

835
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:02,901
-What are you doing?
-I can't leave him here.

836
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:06,471
-Why not?
-Because he's got the right stuff.

837
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:33,437
Base destruct, 60 seconds.

838
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:43,316
-There's no time for autopilot.
-What's the matter now?

839
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:46,513
I'm going to have to pilot this bucket.

840
01:19:06,174 --> 01:19:08,870
Base destruct in 15 seconds.

841
01:19:08,944 --> 01:19:11,674
She is so heavy!

842
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:18,576
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

843
01:19:19,654 --> 01:19:25,490
five, four, three, two, one.

844
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,765
Yeah!

845
01:19:57,793 --> 01:20:00,159
You guys should check this out.

846
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:29,523
-Hey, what do you think?
-Such a big universe.

847
01:20:29,925 --> 01:20:32,519
I am definitely coming back here.

848
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,169
Am I a zombie now?

849
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:51,872
This guy reads too many comic books.

850
01:20:56,952 --> 01:21:00,888
Hey, Neera, now that this is all over,

851
01:21:02,224 --> 01:21:04,215
-would you want to...
-Yes.

852
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:07,090
But you didn't hear what I was gonna...

853
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:15,097
Gross!

854
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:20,602
Strap in, everyone,
'cause I'm taking you home.

855
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:00,538
Hey, it's Lem!

856
01:22:03,985 --> 01:22:05,316
Hi!

857
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:07,979
The General, too.

858
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:10,617
The monster!

859
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:14,057
It's all right, Chief. He's with me.

860
01:22:14,129 --> 01:22:16,689
Soldiers, attention!

861
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:19,992
There is among us an astronaut.

862
01:22:25,206 --> 01:22:28,698
Captain, thanks for coming back for me.

863
01:22:28,977 --> 01:22:30,740
A pleasure, General.

864
01:22:31,713 --> 01:22:35,672
Maybe next time you have guests
you'll throw a better party.

865
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:41,213
Kid, how would you like to be president

866
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:45,487
of the local
Chuck Baker, Party Maker Fan Club?

867
01:22:47,395 --> 01:22:48,919
Oh, yeah!

868
01:22:48,997 --> 01:22:50,464
Oh, can I join?

869
01:22:51,099 --> 01:22:55,695
Be a good boy,
and don't forget to drink your oil.

870
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:00,974
Rover, you coming?

871
01:23:02,043 --> 01:23:04,238
Or do you want to stay here?

872
01:23:06,948 --> 01:23:10,475
Rover! My little bitty boy!

873
01:23:19,894 --> 01:23:23,057
Lem, you saved my life.

874
01:23:24,799 --> 01:23:26,699
You saved mine, too.

875
01:23:32,107 --> 01:23:35,907
That was a man hug, just then.
It's very big on my planet.

876
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:40,270
Hey, take care of this guy, okay?

877
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:51,422
You're a great planet, and your '50s are fine,

878
01:23:51,493 --> 01:23:54,553
but give me a call when you get to the '60s,

879
01:23:54,629 --> 01:23:57,029
'cause that's gonna be fun.

880
01:26:22,577 --> 01:26:26,377
Doc, that brain operation was inspired.

881
01:26:27,615 --> 01:26:29,776
You simply must try it.

882
01:26:29,851 --> 01:26:33,685
No, no, no, no! No! No, no.

883
01:26:39,327 --> 01:26:41,192
Oh, no, no, boy. Easy, easy.

884
01:26:41,262 --> 01:26:43,594
Not the tongue. Not the...

885
01:26:46,568 --> 01:26:48,968
This is gonna be a long trip.
