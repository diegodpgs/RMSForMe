1
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,740
I'm real sorry about Dorothy, Walt.

2
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,493
She was a real peach.

3
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,911
Thanks for coming, Al.

4
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,254
Father, Son, Holy Spirit.

5
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:35,094
Father. Spirit.

6
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,433
Uh.

7
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,185
Holy Spirit.

8
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,145
It's okay, I can move down.

9
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,901
Spectacles, testicles, wallet, and watch.

10
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,121
Look at the way the old man
glared at Ashley.

11
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:05,207
Can't even tone it down
for Mom's funeral.

12
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:09,002
What do you expect?
Dad's still living in the '50s.

13
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,964
He expects his granddaughter
to dress a little more modestly.

14
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,467
Well, your kid's wearing a Lions jersey.
I'm sure Dad appreciates that.

15
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:19,680
The point is that there's nothing anyone
can do that won't disappoint the old man.

16
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,057
It's inevitable.

17
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,229
You know, that's why we stopped
doing Thanksgivings.

18
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:32,609
You know, that deal with the boat motor,
the broken birdbath. It's always something.

19
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,194
What are we gonna do with him?

20
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:38,657
Don't you think he's gonna get in trouble,
all by himself in the old neighborhood?

21
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,537
Well, why don't you have him
move in with you?

22
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,373
Ha, ha, ha.

23
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,458
Hey. Shh.

24
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:10,898
Death is often a bittersweet occasion
to us Catholics.

25
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:16,445
Bitter in the pain, sweet in the salvation.

26
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:22,743
Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased
and their families.

27
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:28,790
Sweet to those of us
who know the salvation that awaits.

28
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,711
And some may ask, "What is death?

29
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,380
Is it the end?

30
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,799
Or is it the beginning?

31
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:43,555
And what is life?
What is this thing we call life?"

32
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,768
- All these questions can frustrate you.
Ashley, stop it.

33
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,479
That's why you have to turn to the Lord.

34
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,730
Jesus.

35
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,399
Because the Lord is the sweetness...

36
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,990
This is so good.
Did you have a chance to call Martha?

37
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,460
Is that Dad?
No. That's Grandpa Walt.

38
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:19,007
"Third platoon, E company,
March 2nd, 1952, Korea"?

39
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,968
Where's Korea?

40
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,682
A lot of people showed up
after the service.

41
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,685
Well, I suppose they heard
there's gonna be a lot of ham.

42
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,145
I'll go down in the basement
and get some chairs.

43
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:35,357
- Oh, I can do that, Dad.
- No, I need them now, not next week.

44
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,781
Cool, I found a medal. Look at this.

45
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,222
How much longer do we have to stay?

46
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,310
This ghetto is a dead zone for my cell,
and I'm bored.

47
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,187
Ashley, why don't you go
help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?

48
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,107
- Me?
- Yes, you. Go. Go help him.

49
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,903
Grandpa Walt,
would you like some help with this?

50
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,196
With your chairs?

51
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:26,575
No. You probably just painted your nails.

52
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:34,041
Honey, come here.
Okay, well, your dad is driving me crazy.

53
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,004
- Why did you make me do that?
It's okay. We're leaving soon.

54
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,840
Hey, girl. Come on.

55
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,427
Come on. Come on.

56
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,804
Come with me.

57
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:15,916
How many swamp rats can you get
in one room?

58
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,229
Wow. Grandpa, when did you
get the vintage car?

59
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,484
1972.

60
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,364
I never knew you had a cool old car.

61
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:51,993
Yeah. Well, it's been here
since before you were born.

62
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,663
So...

63
00:06:54,914 --> 00:07:00,419
...what are you gonna do with it
when you, like, die?

64
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,220
What about that super-cool
retro couch you have in the den?

65
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,222
Because I'm going to state next year...

66
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:16,643
...and it would look really good in my room,
and I don't have any furniture at all.

67
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,527
Oh, God.

68
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,491
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Hi.

69
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,535
- I live-
- Get the shit out of your mouth.

70
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,037
- Tell me what you want.
- Do you have jumper cables?

71
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,748
- My uncle's car is old and-
- We don't have any cables.

72
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,043
And have some respect, zipperhead.
We're in mourning here.

73
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:48,216
- How you holding up, Walt?
- Mr. Kowalski.

74
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,843
Huh?

75
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,053
Mr. Kowalski, that's my name.

76
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,515
Right. Mr. Kowalski.

77
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,351
Your wife and I became quite close
these last few months.

78
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,354
She asked that I watch over you
when she passed on.

79
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,190
I told her I watch over my flock.

80
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:06,067
But she made me promise I'd keep
an extra-sharp eye on you.

81
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,862
Look, I appreciate the kindness
you've shown to my wife.

82
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,697
Now that you've spoken your piece...

83
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,575
...why don't you go tend
to some of your other sheep?

84
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,243
Okay?

85
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:19,998
Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was
her desire for you to go to confession.

86
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,667
She said she couldn't remember
the last time you went.

87
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,253
- Is that so?
- It is.

88
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,549
Well, I confess that I never really
cared for church very much.

89
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,760
The only reason I went
was because of her.

90
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,762
And I confess that I have no desire...

91
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,098
...to confess to a boy
that's just out of the seminary.

92
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,078
Great to see you.

93
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,667
- Bye, dear.
- So long, Walt.

94
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:07,295
Walt, can you get it started?
Yeah, it'll be fine.

95
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:14,094
I wish I could help, Dad,
but I gotta get the kids home.

96
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,764
- Kids are getting restless.
- Yeah, fine. Just go.

97
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,641
I'll call you,
see how you're doing.

98
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:20,892
All right.

99
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:29,651
Kill you to buy American? Jesus.

100
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,529
Did you see the way
he looked at the truck?

101
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,282
It's always rice-burner this,
Jap-burner that, you know?

102
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:38,577
- Even at Mom's funeral, he can't let it go.
- He didn't say anything.

103
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,579
- He didn't need to.
- What do you expect?

104
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,622
The man worked at Ford
all those years.

105
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,251
- I suppose that's my goddamn fault.
- Just give it a rest, just drive, okay?

106
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:50,672
Kids, want the radio on?
Anyone wanna listen to some music? Good.

107
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,607
Damn barbarians.

108
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,612
I'm just so brokenhearted.

109
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,574
I want my daughter
to find another husband.

110
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,077
If she married again
there would be a man in the house.

111
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,748
What about Thao?
The man of the house is right there.

112
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,210
GRaNDMA:
Look at him washing dishes.

113
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:33,465
He does whatever his sister
orders him to do.

114
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,384
How could he ever become the man
of the house?

115
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,056
Be patient, once he's older,
he will be the man of the house.

116
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,515
No way.

117
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,985
Today is a blessed day, for a child is born.

118
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,783
I offer food to nurture this child's body.

119
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,078
I offer clothing
to protect this child's flesh.

120
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:08,291
The child is blessed with a mother
and father.

121
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,336
Oh, spirit of this child...

122
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,923
...return home
and do not wander anymore.

123
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,602
Come home, spirit and soul, come home.

124
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,069
Live a good life and grow old.

125
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:53,420
Jesus. Polarski would roll over in his grave
if he could see his lawn now.

126
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:59,300
What the hell did Chinks have to
move into this neighborhood for?

127
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,305
Why does that old white man stay here?

128
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,018
All the Americans have moved out
of this neighborhood.

129
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,312
Why haven't you gone?

130
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,233
Why don't you strut away,
you dumb rooster?

131
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,289
Are you gone completely deaf
or something?

132
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,834
Hi there, Walt.

133
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,963
I'm not a friend of yours,
so why do you insist on calling me Walt?

134
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,674
Sorry. Mr. Kowalski.

135
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:44,846
- What are you peddling today, Padre?
- Nothing. I thought I'd drop by and see you.

136
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,389
I haven't seen you in church.

137
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:50,018
Now that you've done your good deed,
why don't you take off down the road?

138
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:54,022
- I'd really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski.
- Not in this lifetime, sonny.

139
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,649
Why? Do you have a problem with me,
Mr. Kowalski?

140
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,027
- You don't wanna know.
- No, I do.

141
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:03,531
Well, I think you're an over-educated
27-year-old virgin...

142
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:09,204
...who likes to hold hands of ladies who are
superstitious and promises them eternity.

143
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,054
Yo! Hey!

144
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:30,767
Is you-? Is you a boy or is you a girl, man?
I can't tell.

145
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,144
Hey, chinito, hey,
if you was in the pen...

146
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,730
...I'd be fucking you in the ass.
You'd be my bitch.

147
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,149
What are you reading,
Jackass and the Rice Stalk?

148
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,402
Yeah, that's right, keep walking!
Keep walking!

149
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,321
Look at me when I talk to you, homes!

150
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,907
Fucking slopes, man,
everywhere you look, man.

151
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,868
Slopes everywhere we go, man.
Go back to your rice paddy.

152
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,996
What you looking at, man?

153
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,589
- That's my little cousin over there.
- You sure that's your cousin, man?

154
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,634
- Fuck, yeah, that's my little cousin.
- He tight with anybody?

155
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,095
No, he flies solo, man.
You wanna do something?

156
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,473
Man, let's go down there and see
what the fuck they doing over there.

157
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,898
I like your sandals too.

158
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,069
- Hey. Yo, what's up? What's up?
- Yo, what's up, motherfuckers?

159
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,030
They fucking with you?
Man, fuck you, homeboy!

160
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,367
- What you got?
Hey, we can do this right now.

161
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,203
- You go fucking back to your country.
- Fuck you, man.

162
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,747
Oh, good, more fucking rice niggers.

163
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,292
Aren't you supposed to cook me
some Chinese food, huh?

164
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:44,883
- How many bullets you got?
- We'll catch you on the rebound, homey.

165
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,308
Thao!
Come on, man. Get in the car, man.

166
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,184
Thao.

167
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,978
- Get with us, man.
- Get in the car.

168
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,814
Fuck, man, get in the car, man.
Thao!

169
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,190
Those punk-ass Mexicans
messing with you?

170
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:05,361
Dog, we just bailed your ass out, dog.
Come on, dog, get the fuck in here.

171
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,823
What you doing, man?
Get in the car, man, come on.

172
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,075
Chill with us, man.

173
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,370
Come on, man.
We just bailed your ass out, dog!

174
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,289
Come on.

175
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,046
Come on, Thao, man. You need a big coz
to take care of you, man.

176
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,547
Man, fuck it. Hey.

177
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,050
Forget it, man. Let's go, dude.
Fuck his ass.

178
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:30,094
- Tomorrow, I'll see your ass.
Why you gotta be a little girl?

179
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,304
Tomorrow.

180
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,556
Come on, man, let's go.
We got the gun, man.

181
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,767
Fuck you.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

182
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,561
- We've got the strap.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

183
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,855
- Fuck that pussy.
Pussy.

184
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,867
Hey, Thao.

185
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,790
Hey, what's up?

186
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,210
What's up, Thao?

187
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,339
What are you doing, little man?

188
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:10,009
- Why you doing women's work?
- What do you want?

189
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,638
What? I can't just come
and talk to my little cousin?

190
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,935
- He doesn't wanna talk to you.
- Well, I'm here, right?

191
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,187
Hey, Spider, who that?
What's up?

192
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,565
Spider? Is that what
he just called you, Fong?

193
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,901
Spider.

194
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,863
- Is there something wrong with Spider?
- What are you doing here?

195
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,241
Hey, so how old is you anyways?

196
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,494
- Mentally, I'm way too old for you.
- What?

197
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,163
You guys are stupid. I'm going inside.

198
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,040
- What?
- Sue.

199
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,253
Help your little bro do this gardening.

200
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,505
Bite it, stupid.

201
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,259
Hey. You wanna roll with us, man?
Come on.

202
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,803
- Dude.
- Come on, ride with us. Come on.

203
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,388
Come on, chill with us.

204
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,641
You need somebody to protect you.
That's what your big coz is for.

205
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,269
Look, dog, I been there, done it,
and I seen it, man.

206
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,813
Back in the day, everybody used to
wanna beat me up.

207
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,606
But now, nobody wanna fuck with me.

208
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,234
- Come on, man, let's go.
- We're coz, right?

209
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:12,155
Come on.
- We're coz, right? We're family.

210
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:16,451
Look, a brother to Spider
is a brother to me. Come on.

211
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,494
Dude, man, take this shit off.
Come on.

212
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:21,581
Come on, roll with us. Come on.
That's woman's work, man.

213
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,291
Don't get your hands dirty, man.

214
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,463
So, what do I have to do?

215
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:33,217
Spider told me that our boy next door
got a bad-ass whip.

216
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,806
Come on.

217
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,225
Nice.

218
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,687
Yeah, my little cousin being a little man.

219
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,860
Whoa.

220
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,281
Yo, now, that's a nice car.

221
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:59,327
Hell, yeah. 1972 Gran Torino, fastback.

222
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,370
- Yo.
- Cobra jet engine.

223
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,539
Yo, man, it's still in mint condition.

224
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:08,252
Yo, man. It's in mint condition, man.

225
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,756
Oh, I've got one.

226
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:15,301
There's a Mexican, a Jew,
and a colored guy go into a bar.

227
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:19,555
The bartender looks up and says,
"Get the fuck out of here. "

228
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,893
So here's where my flock congregates
when they're not in church.

229
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,103
Hey, Father J.

230
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,729
Hi, Mel. Hey there, Darrell.

231
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,107
- Hello, Father.
- Hi, Walt.

232
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,777
What brings you in here, Father?
The meat raffle?

233
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:37,865
No, I just came down to talk to Walt,
if that's okay.

234
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:43,621
Damn, Padre, you are persistent,
aren't you?

235
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,706
I promised your wife.

236
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,293
All right. Let's get a booth.

237
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:56,843
I'll have a Pabst and a shot of Jack
and whatever he's having.

238
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,513
- I'll have a Diet Coke.
- Bullshit, this is a bar. You have a drink.

239
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:04,809
- Um, I'll have a gin and tonic.
Attaboy.

240
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,728
So...

241
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,897
...what do you want?

242
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,900
I promised your wife I'd get you
to go to confession.

243
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,694
Now, why would you do that?

244
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:18,197
She was very insistent. She made me.

245
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,285
You're kind of fond of promising things
you can't deliver on. Right, Father?

246
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,787
- Let's talk about something else.
- What?

247
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,497
Life and death.

248
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:31,711
Life and death. What the hell do you know
about life and death?

249
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:35,548
I'd like to think I know a lot. I'm a priest.

250
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,718
Yeah. You get up and preach about life
and death...

251
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,679
...but all you know is what you learned
in priest school.

252
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,974
Right out of the rookie
preacher's handbook.

253
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,101
I don't know about that. I think-

254
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,145
Death is bittersweet.

255
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,899
Sort of bitter in its pain,
but sweet in its salvation.

256
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:57,570
That's what you know about life and death,
and it's pathetic.

257
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,197
What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?

258
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:04,202
I know a lot. I lived for almost three years
in Korea with it.

259
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,078
Thanks.

260
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,414
We shot men...

261
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:14,962
...stabbed them with bayonets,
hacked 17-year-olds to death with shovels.

262
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,799
Stuff I'll remember till the day I die.

263
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:23,721
Horrible things, but things I'll live with.

264
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,765
And what about life?

265
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:35,149
Well, I survived the war.

266
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,403
Got married, had a family.

267
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,742
Sounds like you know a lot more
about death than you do living.

268
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,334
Maybe so, Father.

269
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,586
Maybe so.

270
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,723
Son of a bitch.

271
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,405
Come on, get in the car!
Thao, what the fuck? Get in!

272
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,490
- Get in, Thao.
- Come on, let's go. Get in.

273
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,034
Fuck, man? Get in!

274
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,474
- Hello?
- Hey. Morning, Dad.

275
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,351
It's your number one son, Mitch.

276
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:37,271
Morning? It's after 1 in the afternoon,
it's not morning.

277
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:41,025
Oh, right. Afternoon, then.

278
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,903
So, what do you want?

279
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:48,783
What? No. Nothing.
I mean, what would I want?

280
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:49,992
Well, I don't know.

281
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,079
Your wife's already gone through
all your mother's jewelry.

282
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:58,376
No, Dad, I'm just calling
to see how you're doing. Just...

283
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,128
Anything new
with the old neighborhood?

284
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,255
Yeah. No.

285
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,383
Great. Smooth sailing.

286
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,592
Yeah.

287
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,764
- Okay, good. Good, then. Oh, hey, Dad.
- Yeah.

288
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:17,436
You wouldn't happen to still know that guy
that has the Lions season tickets?

289
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:21,315
Oh, you fuck.

290
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,150
Dad-

291
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:57,017
Ain't she sweet.

292
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,119
Come on, girl.

293
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:33,345
Yo, what's up? What are you guys
doing out here, man?

294
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:36,390
Nothing.
Minding our own business.

295
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,142
Just hanging out.

296
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,728
What are you guys doing here?

297
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,564
- What?
I told you guys already-

298
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,567
Can't I just come hang out
with my little cousin?

299
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,027
Huh?

300
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,740
We have good news for you, man.

301
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,075
Oh, really? And what's that?

302
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,494
Only for guy talk.

303
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,954
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

304
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:01,415
Come on, man.
We gonna give you another shot, man.

305
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:04,084
- Don't go, Thao.
Mind your own business, girl.

306
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,921
- Come on, let's go.
Come.

307
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,257
- Yeah, what are you gonna do, huh?
Come on, dog.

308
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,950
Look. You've broken Daddy's gnome.

309
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:41,205
What the hell is this?

310
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:46,460
Get up.
- Get off my lawn.

311
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,090
Listen, old man,
you don't wanna fuck with me.

312
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:54,093
Did you hear me?
I said, get off my lawn now.

313
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,262
Are you fucking crazy?
Go back in the house.

314
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:59,932
Yeah. I blow a hole in your face,
and then I go in the house.

315
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,143
And I sleep like a baby.
You can count on that.

316
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,313
We used to stack fucks like you
five feet high in Korea...

317
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,566
...use you for sandbags.

318
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,113
Okay.

319
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:19,159
- But you better watch your back.
- Fuck it, man, he's crazy.

320
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,293
We'll get this cracker next time.

321
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,173
Thank you.

322
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,094
Get off my lawn.

323
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,713
What the hell is this?

324
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,223
Christ.

325
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:27,645
No, no. No, no, no.
Come on, no more. No more.

326
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,688
No more. What-?

327
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,902
Stay right there. Stay right there.

328
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,654
Why can't you just leave me alone?

329
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,572
We brought you some shallots
to plant.

330
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,574
- I don't want them.
- They're perennials.

331
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,994
- They come back every year.
- Why are you bringing me all this garbage?

332
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,829
Because...

333
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:49,667
- Because you saved Thao.
- I didn't save anybody.

334
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:53,337
I just- I kept a bunch of jabbering gooks
off of my lawn, that's all.

335
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,547
- You're a hero to the neighborhood.
- I'm not a hero.

336
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:58,425
They think you are.
That's why they keep bringing you gifts.

337
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,094
- Please, take them.
- They're wrong.

338
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,054
Now, I just want to be left alone.
Thank you.

339
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,473
Wait.

340
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:09,770
This is my mom, Vu, I'm Sue,
and that's my brother, Thao.

341
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,439
- We live next door.
- So?

342
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,942
Thao wants to say something.

343
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:18,904
I'm sorry.

344
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:23,575
- Sorry for what?
- For trying to steal your car.

345
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,454
Let me tell you something, boy.

346
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:31,917
You step on this property again,
you're done.

347
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,525
Good afternoon, Walt.

348
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,820
I told you I'm not going to confession.

349
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:03,490
- Why didn't you just call the police?
- What?

350
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,492
I do work
with some of the Hmong gangs...

351
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,120
...and I heard there was trouble
in the neighborhood.

352
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,330
Why didn't you call the police?

353
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,958
Well...

354
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:18,005
You know, I prayed
that they would show up...

355
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,966
...but nobody answered.

356
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,718
What were you thinking?

357
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:26,263
Someone could have been killed.
We're talking life and death here.

358
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:30,017
When things go wrong,
you gotta act quickly.

359
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:34,146
When we were in Korea and a thousand
screaming gooks came across our line...

360
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,190
...we didn't call the police, we reacted.

361
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:39,026
We're not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski.

362
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,739
I've been thinking about our conversation
on life and death.

363
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,699
About what you said.

364
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:49,495
About how you carry around all the horrible
things you were forced to do...

365
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,830
...horrible things that won't leave you.

366
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:57,461
It seems it would do you good
to unload some of that burden.

367
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,547
Things done during war are terrible.

368
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,674
Being ordered to kill.

369
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:05,719
Killing to save yourself,
killing to save others.

370
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:10,265
You're right. Those are things
I know nothing about...

371
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,976
...but I do know about forgiveness...

372
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:16,480
...and I've seen a lot of men
who have confessed their sins...

373
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:20,901
...admitted their guilt,
and left their burdens behind them.

374
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,403
Stronger men than you.

375
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:26,448
Men at war who were ordered
to do appalling things...

376
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,076
...and are now at peace.

377
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,787
Well, I gotta hand it to you, Padre.

378
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:34,081
You came here
with your guns loaded this time.

379
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,250
Thank you.

380
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,502
And you're right about one thing.

381
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,339
About stronger men than me
reaching their salvation.

382
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,592
Well, halle-fucking-lujah.

383
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,595
But you're wrong about something else.

384
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,139
What's that, Mr. Kowalski?

385
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:56,937
The thing that haunts a man the most
is what he isn't ordered to do.

386
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:04,987
There. You finally look
like a human being again.

387
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:08,448
You shouldn't wait so long between
haircuts, you cheap son of a bitch.

388
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:11,702
Yeah. Well, I'm surprised
you're still around.

389
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,328
I was always hoping you'd die...

390
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:16,123
...and they'd get somebody
who knew what they were doing.

391
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,626
Instead you just keep hanging around
like the doo-wop dago you are.

392
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:23,922
- That'll be 10 bucks, Walt.
- Ten bucks? Jesus Christ, Martin.

393
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,134
What are you, half Jew or something?
You keep raising the prices.

394
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:31,471
It's been 10 bucks for the last five years,
you hard-nosed, Polack son of a bitch.

395
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:35,642
- Yeah, well, keep the change.
- See you in three weeks, prick.

396
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,145
Not if I see you first, dipshit.

397
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,568
Since everything could go downhill
after that.

398
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,486
- Yeah, that's true.
- That would suck.

399
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:51,658
- That's cool, you know? Yeah.
Ain't shit going on, man.

400
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,287
Ain't shit going on.

401
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:58,582
Man, look at this. Look at this, Monk.
Check this out.

402
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,834
Oooh. Boy.
Oh, yeah.

403
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:04,963
Bring that little tight ass over here.
Come here, girl. Don't be shy.

404
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:09,343
What, you can't say hi?
Why you acting all stuck-up and shit?

405
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:14,514
- What you supposed to be, man?
- Yo, it's cool, dog.

406
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,684
What the fuck you doing
in my neighborhood, boy?

407
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:21,396
Nothing. Just going down to Corner Spot,
you know? Get some CDs.

408
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:22,606
It's all good, bro.

409
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:24,816
See, he called you bro, Duke.

410
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,152
- He called you bro, man.
- It's all good, bro.

411
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,071
It's all good, huh?
Shut the fuck up.

412
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:32,115
Call me bro again, man,
I'll bite your motherfucking face off.

413
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,533
Yeah, motherfucker.

414
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,869
Now, what the fuck
y'all come down here for?

415
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:39,665
You here to bring me this little present?
Monk? She bringing it to us?

416
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,500
This little Oriental yummy.

417
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,002
Don't worry.
I'm gonna take real good care of her.

418
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,546
- Fuck out of here, man.
- Fuck out of here, man.

419
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,846
- I told you we're finished here.
Oh, yeah.

420
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,306
Keep your ass right here.

421
00:32:56,891 --> 00:33:00,310
Oh, great. Another asshole
who has a fetish for Asian girls?

422
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,854
God, that gets so old.

423
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,690
Oh, shit.
- What's your name, girl?

424
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,692
My name?

425
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,694
Get your ass out of here, okay?

426
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:11,863
It's "Take your crude come-on
to every woman who walks past...

427
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,157
...and cram it. " That's my name.

428
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,743
Mouthy little bitch.

429
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:20,205
- Who you think you talking to?
- Who does it look like?

430
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:23,792
- You think you real funny, don't you?
- Oh, shit. Ain't she tough?

431
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,754
What? You gonna hit me now? That would
pretty much complete the picture.

432
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,756
You need to keep your bitch on a leash.

433
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:32,592
Put a chain on that whore
and yank that motherfucker.

434
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,886
Of course. Right to the
stereotype thesaurus.

435
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:37,431
Call me a whore and a bitch
in the same sentence.

436
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,641
- This bitch is crazy.
I like them like that.

437
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:40,934
Man, take this bitch.

438
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:44,354
Hey. Get off me.

439
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,235
- You don't know when to quit, do you?
I'm gonna teach her a lesson.

440
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,446
Stop. Let go.

441
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,951
Get your ass over there.

442
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,124
What the fuck you looking at, old man?

443
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:08,545
- What the hell are you spooks up to?
- Spooks?

444
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:12,090
You better get your ass on, honky,
while I still let you.

445
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:14,509
- That's what you better do.
- That's right, bitch.

446
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,304
Fuck you think you at?

447
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:30,317
Ever notice how you come across somebody
once in a while...

448
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,319
...that you shouldn't have fucked with?

449
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,991
That's me.

450
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,828
Man, you fucking crazy, man.
Get out of here, man.

451
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:45,916
Why don't you get your ass up out of here
before I kick your old, wrinkly, white ass?

452
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,836
Crazy motherfucker, man.
What's wrong with him, man?

453
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,966
What the fuck?

454
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,512
- This motherfucker crazy, man.
- What's wrong with this nigga, man?

455
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,222
What the hell?

456
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,516
Get in the truck.

457
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,562
This crazy motherfucker, man.
What's wrong with him, man?

458
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,523
He put his finger at us.

459
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,526
- Oh, shit.
- Come on, now. Hey, pops. Come on, now.

460
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:15,112
Shut your fucking face.

461
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,698
You fucking don't listen, do you?

462
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,159
Now, get in the truck.

463
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:24,412
- Go on, get in the truck now. Shit.
Way to go, old man.

464
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,998
Shut up, pussy.

465
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,836
What is all this "bro" shit, anyway?

466
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:34,506
Want to be Super Spade or something?
These guys don't want to be your bro...

467
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:38,385
...and I don't blame them. Now, get
your ofay, Paddy ass on down the road.

468
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,893
Take care, now.

469
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,897
Yeah, you too.

470
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,154
Oh, yeah.

471
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,124
Fuck, man, why y'all
didn't fucking do nothing?

472
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,585
- Man, kick that nigga's ass.
- Man, you fucking-

473
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,044
Shit, man.

474
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,630
This fucker.
He had that cannon in your fucking face.

475
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,924
- You didn't do nothing.
- Trying to stay out.

476
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,677
What's the matter with you,
for chrissake?

477
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,972
Trying to get yourself killed?

478
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,892
I thought you Asian girls
were supposed to be smart.

479
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:30,896
Hanging around a neighborhood like that's
a fast way to get you in the obituaries.

480
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:33,315
I know. I know. Take it easy.

481
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:36,193
And what about that goofball guy
you were with?

482
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,778
Is that a date or something?

483
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:42,115
Yeah. Kind of. His name is Trey.

484
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,367
Well, you shouldn't be hanging out
with him.

485
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,621
You should be hanging out with your
own people, with other Humongs.

486
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:51,625
You mean Hmong?
We're Hmong, not "Humong. "

487
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,585
Whatever.

488
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:57,672
Where the hell is Humong,
I mean Hmong, anyway?

489
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,717
Wow.

490
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:05,513
You're so enlightened, you know that?
No, Hmong isn't a place. It's a people.

491
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:08,808
Hmong people come from different parts
of Laos, Thailand, and China.

492
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:11,853
Yeah. Well, how did you end up
in my neighborhood, then?

493
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,939
Why didn't you stay there?

494
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,609
It's a Vietnam thing.
We fought on your side.

495
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:21,529
And when the Americans quit, the
Communists started killing all the Hmong.

496
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,490
So we came over here.

497
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:27,410
Yeah. Well, I don't know
how you ended up in the Midwest.

498
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,330
There's snow on the ground
six months out of the year.

499
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,959
Why does a jungle people want to
be in the great frozen tundra?

500
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:39,297
Hill people. We were hill people.
Not jungle people. Booga-booga-booga.

501
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,883
Yeah. Whatever.

502
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,594
Blame the Lutherans.
They brought us over here.

503
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,888
Everybody blames the Lutherans.

504
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:52,811
Well, you'd think the cold
would keep all the idiots out.

505
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,856
Thanks for the ride.

506
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,651
You know something, kid?
You're all right.

507
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,612
But what about that dimwit brother
of yours?

508
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,741
- He a little slow or something?
- Thao is actually really smart.

509
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:09,369
He just doesn't know
which direction to go in.

510
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:14,082
- Yeah. Poor Toad.
- It's really common.

511
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,042
Hmong girls over here fit in better.

512
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,379
The girls go to college,
and the boys go to jail.

513
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,217
Yeah.

514
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,980
That old hag hates my ass.

515
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,442
Well...

516
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:49,034
"Your birthday today. " Daisy.

517
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:53,913
"This year, you have to make a choice
between two life paths.

518
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,999
Second chances come your way.

519
00:38:56,167 --> 00:39:01,254
Extraordinary events culminate
in what might seem to be an anticlimax.

520
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:05,258
Your lucky numbers are 84, 23...

521
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:10,096
...11, 78, and 99."

522
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,224
What a load of shit.

523
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,394
Yeah.

524
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:34,120
What the hell is it with kids nowadays?

525
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,457
All right.

526
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,377
Hey, Mrs. V.
Here, let me help you with those.

527
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:44,464
Oh, thank you. I just-
I got it.

528
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,467
How about that?

529
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,929
Here you go.
- How about that, Daisy?

530
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,313
Yeah, I got it.

531
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:03,108
That was too heavy for the bag.

532
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,818
No problem.
- Thank you.

533
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:18,540
- Go ahead, Karen, give it to him.
- Here you go.

534
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,919
- Well, what is it?
- It's a Gopher.

535
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:27,006
So you can reach stuff.
You know, it makes things a lot easier.

536
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,009
This is from me.

537
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,637
It's a phone.

538
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,850
- Oh, I can see that.
- I just thought-

539
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:39,269
Well, we thought
that it would make things easier.

540
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,438
Well, thank you, Karen.

541
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,524
There's nothing wrong with making things
less hard on yourself.

542
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,193
Karen's right, Dad. You've worked hard
your whole life.

543
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:51,114
Maybe it's time you started thinking about,
you know, taking it easier.

544
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:56,035
Jeez. That's another thing, Dad.
You really should get rid of the coffin nails.

545
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,914
But, I don't know, we were thinking
about the house.

546
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:03,126
You know, what with Mom gone,
it's gotta be a lot to maintain around here.

547
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,878
- Mm-hm.
- Let alone clean.

548
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,214
And, I don't know, you're here all alone.

549
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:12,260
Yeah, and there are these great places now,
you know, these communities...

550
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:16,514
...where you don't have to worry
about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow...

551
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:20,685
...where the people are like you,
active and alert, but are alone...

552
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:24,564
...and would benefit from being
around folks their own age.

553
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:28,193
Yeah, Dad, look. You gotta check it out.
We've brought some brochures.

554
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,987
These places are nothing like
what you'd think they'd be.

555
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,947
- They're great.
- No, no, beautiful.

556
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:38,578
They're really nice. They really are.
These are top-notch, like, resorts.

557
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,706
- It's like staying in a hotel practically.
- They're beautiful.

558
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,041
They really are.
- Yeah.

559
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:47,045
They take care of everything.
They'll clean up. They're really nice.

560
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,464
They have wonderful stores.
You can buy new shoes.

561
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,509
They're amazing. They really are.
You'd have a good time.

562
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:56,554
- Play some golf, maybe.
Meet other people.

563
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,808
Son of a bitch.
Kicking us out on his birthday.

564
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:03,603
- I told you this was a bad idea.
- I know. You were right.

565
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,981
- He won't let anybody help him.
- Well, we tried. Can we just drop it?

566
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,900
No one can say we didn't try.

567
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,402
The hell with him.
You know what we should've done?

568
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,655
We should've stayed home
with Josh and Ashley.

569
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:15,949
At least they were smart enough
to not come.

570
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:18,618
Goddamn kids have more sense
than we do.

571
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:24,082
We miss Mama, don't we, Daisy? Yeah.

572
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,420
Yeah.

573
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,726
Hey, Walt.

574
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,812
What are you up to?

575
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,816
We're having a barbecue.
You wanna come over?

576
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,986
- What do you think?
- There's tons of food.

577
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:56,781
Yeah. Just keep your hands off my dog.

578
00:42:56,949 --> 00:43:00,493
- No worries. We only eat cats.
- Really?

579
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:04,330
No, I'm kidding, you moron.
Come on, you can be my special guest.

580
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:07,125
No, I'm fine right here.

581
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,502
Yeah.

582
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:15,341
- Son of a bitch.
- Okay, so, what have you had to eat today?

583
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:21,514
Oh, I had a piece of cake
and a little beef jerky.

584
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:25,351
Come on over and get something to eat.
We've got beer too.

585
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:34,152
Well, I might as well drink with strangers
rather than drink alone.

586
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,571
After all, it is my birthday.

587
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:41,701
- Really? Happy birthday, Wally.
- Don't call me Wally.

588
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:51,544
Well, no Pabst, but plenty of beer.

589
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:56,466
- As they say, when in Humong.
- Ha, ha. Hey, what am I doing wrong?

590
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,218
Every time I look at somebody,
they look at the ground.

591
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,220
You're fine.

592
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,895
What's she saying?
- She said welcome to her home.

593
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,481
- Oh, no, she's not.
- Yeah, no, she didn't.

594
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:15,401
- She hates me. Come on.
- Yeah, she hates you.

595
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,446
Okay. Hey.

596
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:27,538
Hey, what are all you fish heads
looking at anyway?

597
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:32,543
I think we should go
into the other room. Sorry.

598
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,592
A lot of people in this house
are very traditional.

599
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,680
Number one, never touch a Hmong person
on their head, not even a child.

600
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:48,267
Hmong people believe that the soul
resides on the head, so don't do that.

601
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,436
Well, sounds dumb, but fine.

602
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:55,191
Yeah, and a lot of Hmong people consider
looking someone in the eye to be very rude.

603
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,069
That's why they look away
when you look at them.

604
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,779
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

605
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:04,492
Some Hmong people tend to smile or grin
when they're yelled at.

606
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:09,205
It's a cultural thing.
It expresses embarrassment or insecurity.

607
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,624
It's not that they're laughing
at you or anything.

608
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:14,544
Yeah. God, you people are nuts.

609
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,800
But the food does look good.
Smells good too.

610
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:23,136
Well, of course. It's Hmong food.

611
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:27,765
Yeah. Okay.
Can I come back for seconds?

612
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:37,817
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

613
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,236
You know, you mentioned
about looking at people.

614
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:43,614
- He's been staring at me the whole evening.
- That's Kor Khue.

615
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:45,158
He's the Lor family shaman.

616
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:48,119
And what's that, some sort
of a witch doctor or something?

617
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,329
- Something like that.
- Yeah. Booga-booga.

618
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:53,499
Ha, ha. Very funny, Wally.

619
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,017
Kor Khue's interested in you.
He heard what you did.

620
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:14,061
He would like to read you.
It'd be rude not to allow him this.

621
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:15,938
It's a great honor.

622
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:21,235
- Yeah, sure, fine by me. Sure.
- All right. Take a seat.

623
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,696
Here?

624
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:42,215
He says that people do not respect you.
They don't even wanna look at you.

625
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,015
He says the way you live,
your food has no flavor.

626
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:53,434
You're worried about your life.

627
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:04,904
You made a mistake in your past life,
like a mistake that you did...

628
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,240
...you're not satisfied with.

629
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:17,250
He says you have no happiness in your life.
It's like you're not at peace.

630
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:44,610
Are you all right?

631
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:49,907
Yeah, I'm... Yeah, I'm fine.

632
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:53,452
Fine. I'm fine.

633
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,892
God, I've got more in common
with these gooks...

634
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:19,061
...than I do my own spoilt rotten family.

635
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:21,647
Jesus Christ.

636
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,485
Happy birthday.

637
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:31,824
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

638
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,160
You were bleeding.

639
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:38,372
No, I bit my tongue. It's nothing.

640
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:41,000
Why don't we go
and get some of that good gook food?

641
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:44,253
- You know, I'm starving.
- Okay.

642
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:53,179
Fantastic. Well, you ladies are wonderful.

643
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:56,015
This stuff is really good.

644
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,441
Come on, you glutton.

645
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,318
- What's up?
- Let's go.

646
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,696
- What for?
To mingle.

647
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:12,990
Mingle? We're mingling right here.

648
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:16,369
Come on. You told me
not to leave you alone.

649
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:23,876
Thank you very much, but I have
to go now. I have to go now.

650
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:28,839
I'll be back.
Now, don't let anything go away.

651
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:38,766
Oh, great.

652
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:41,644
Well, well, well. Look who's over there.

653
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,897
- Yeah, the kid who stole my Gran Torino.
- My brother, Thao.

654
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:49,151
Tried to, anyway. Yeah. Yeah, Toad.

655
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:22,435
It was a little wobbly,
but that should fix it.

656
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:35,239
So where are you guys from?

657
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:37,616
- I'm not far from here.
- I'm from Texas.

658
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:57,261
- What's this?
- A little rice liquor. Here, try it.

659
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:58,721
All right.

660
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:25,831
My friends and I were just wondering
what you're doing here.

661
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:29,085
Well, that's a good question.
What am I doing here?

662
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:32,421
- Name's Walt.
- Hi, Walt. I'm Youa.

663
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:36,300
- Yuam. A pleasure.
- No. Youa.

664
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:38,469
Youa, okay.

665
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:41,847
So, what do you do?

666
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:45,101
- Oh, I fix things, stuff like that.
- Like what?

667
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:50,773
Well, I just fixed that dryer there,
I fixed my wife's friend's sink...

668
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:56,028
...and I took old Aunt Mary to the doctor's
to get her prescription fixed up.

669
00:51:56,196 --> 00:52:00,533
And then I even fixed a door
that hadn't even broken yet.

670
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,535
You're funny.

671
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:05,204
I've been called a lot of things,
but never funny.

672
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:11,335
- Well, I'm gonna take off. Enjoy yourself.
- Okay. Yum Yum. Pleasure.

673
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:17,758
Look, she's going, man. Come on.

674
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:21,595
Youa, wait up.

675
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:25,975
Relax, zipperhead.
I'm not gonna shoot you.

676
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:29,645
I'd look down too, if I was you.

677
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,648
I knew you were a dipshit
the first time I ever saw you...

678
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:35,151
...but I never thought you were worse
with women...

679
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:38,654
...than you are at stealing cars, Toad.

680
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:41,991
- It's Thao.
- What?

681
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:45,494
It's not Toad, it's Thao.
My name is Thao.

682
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,372
Yeah, well, you're blowing it with that girl
who was there.

683
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,417
Not that I give two shits
about a toad like you.

684
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:54,336
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- You're wrong.

685
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,297
I know exactly what I'm talking about.

686
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:58,924
I may not be the most pleasant person
to be around...

687
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:02,595
...but I got the best woman
that was ever on this planet to marry me.

688
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:05,723
I worked at it. It was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

689
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:09,685
But you, you know, you're letting
Click Clack, Ding Dong, and Charlie Chan...

690
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,896
...just walk out
with Miss What's-Her-Face.

691
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:15,941
She likes you, you know?
Though I don't know why.

692
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,068
Who?

693
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:23,032
Yum Yum. You know, the girl
in the purple sweater.

694
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,410
She's been looking at you all day, stupid.

695
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,121
You mean Youa.

696
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:32,625
Yeah, Yum Yum, yeah. Nice girl. Nice girl.
A very charming girl.

697
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:35,127
I talked with her. Yeah.

698
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:38,464
But you, you let her just walk right out
with the Three Stooges.

699
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:41,258
And you know why?
Because you're a big, fat pussy.

700
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,554
Well...

701
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:47,848
...I gotta go.

702
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:51,143
Good day, puss-cake.

703
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:06,242
No. No more.

704
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:11,872
Well, okay, put them over there.

705
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,382
Bye-bye.

706
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:29,682
No, no. No, no more. No more.
Come on. No more, now.

707
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,353
No more, please. I-

708
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:38,440
Is this that chicken-dumpling thing
you brought the other-?

709
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,317
Oh, all right.

710
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,113
Come on, ladies.

711
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:49,368
Certainly better than beef jerky,
I'll tell you.

712
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:06,468
What's going on?

713
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:08,762
Thao is here to make amends.
He's here to work for you.

714
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:13,392
No, he isn't.
He's not gonna work for me.

715
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,937
My mom said he dishonored the family
and now he has to work off his debt.

716
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:19,815
- He'll start tomorrow morning.
- Not tomorrow, not any time.

717
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:23,527
I don't even want him on my property.
I thought we went over all that.

718
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:29,366
It's very important that you accept,
and it would be an insult if you refuse.

719
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:31,243
Why is this being put back on me?

720
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:33,412
He's the one who tried to steal my car.

721
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,664
All of a sudden, I'm the bad guy in this.

722
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:38,375
Look, my family is very traditional...

723
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:41,503
...and would be very much upset
if you don't let Thao repay.

724
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:44,048
If he doesn't wanna do it,
then let's just go.

725
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:46,258
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

726
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:50,721
Yeah. Shut up.

727
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:54,058
All right. Tomorrow, come on.

728
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:57,269
Tomorrow. Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

729
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:58,937
Thank you.

730
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:05,486
Jesus, Joseph, and Mary,
these Hmong broads are like badgers.

731
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:13,702
Son of a bitch,
I never thought he'd show.

732
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,044
All right. What are you good at?

733
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,047
Like what?

734
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:28,300
Well, that's what I'm asking.

735
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:31,553
If you're gonna work for me,
I gotta know what you're good at.

736
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,972
I gotta know what you can do.

737
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,474
I don't know.

738
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:39,978
Well, that's kind of halfway
what I expected you to say.

739
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:41,814
You see that tree right there?

740
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,608
You just go over there
and count the birds.

741
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,444
You want me to count the birds?

742
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:52,825
Yeah, you can count. All you slopes
are supposed to be good at math, right?

743
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:55,911
- Yeah, I can count.
- Good.

744
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,294
One, two...

745
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:13,095
So, what do you have for me today?
You want me to watch paint dry?

746
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:18,016
- Maybe even count the clouds that pass by?
- Don't get flip with me, boy.

747
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:21,645
I'm not the one who tried to steal.
Don't you forget that.

748
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:27,401
Go ahead. I don't care if you insult me
or say racist things.

749
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:30,195
Because you know what? I'll take it.

750
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:34,116
Yeah, course you'll take it, because you
have no teeth, you have no balls, kid.

751
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:39,037
Look, I'm stuck here...

752
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:42,624
...so why don't you just find something
useful for me to do?

753
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:47,796
Because unlike you, I'm not useless,
and I maintain my own property.

754
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:51,842
You swamp rats, on the other hand,
you just can't help but...

755
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:56,305
How long do I have you for?

756
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:03,353
- Toad? How long?
- Till next Friday.

757
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:06,940
Yeah.

758
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:12,237
All right. Go get the ladder
out of the garage.

759
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:19,870
When you get finished with that roof there,
you can take that gutter and nail it back up.

760
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:23,165
I'm tired of looking at it
the last three years.

761
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,464
Yeah.

762
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:33,509
Yeah, you said it, brother.

763
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,575
Hello.

764
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,451
Grandpa says he wants to know...

765
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:47,791
...if you can have Thao clear out
the big wasp nest under our porch.

766
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:50,002
Wasp nest?

767
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:51,753
Well, that's terrible.

768
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:55,966
Yeah, well, I think we can handle that
after lunch.

769
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:35,213
Jesus, Lord Almighty, knock it off.

770
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:39,635
Hey, it's my last day.
So, what else do you have for me to do?

771
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:44,306
Take the day off. You've done enough.

772
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:51,563
Toad.

773
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,403
Nothing, never mind.

774
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:08,163
The doctor will see you now. Thank you.

775
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:32,270
Koski?

776
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:43,532
Mr. Kowalski? Good morning.
I looked over your paperwork...

777
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:47,035
...and I think we should immediately
start a full battery of tests.

778
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:50,789
I feel that this would be the best
way to go about...

779
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:53,792
- ... checking out the issues that you've had-
- Excuse me.

780
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,753
What happened to Dr. Feldman,
my regular doctor?

781
01:01:57,463 --> 01:02:02,134
Dr. Feldman retired three years ago.
I'm his replacement, Dr. Chu.

782
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:12,102
- It's Grandpa Walt.
- Pick it up.

783
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:14,146
- You talk to him.
- Mitch.

784
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:19,776
- I'm doing bills here.
You talk to him. He's your father.

785
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:25,574
Hey, Dad.

786
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:29,995
Hi, Mitch, it's- It's me, your dad.

787
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:32,205
Yeah, I know. What's up?

788
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:34,499
Oh, nothing. Nothing much, really.

789
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:40,130
- How's everything going?
- I'm fine. Fine. Doing fine.

790
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:45,886
Fine. Good.
How about Karen and the kids?

791
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:49,848
Fine, everybody's great. Doing fine.

792
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:55,020
- Good. How about work?
- Busy.

793
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:59,191
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I suppose.

794
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:03,445
In fact, speaking of busy,
I got a lot on my plate right now...

795
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,614
...so if there's not something pressing...

796
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:10,452
No. No, not at all.

797
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,121
So why don't you call me this weekend?

798
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:14,664
Sure.

799
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:17,667
Okay. It was nice talking to you, Dad.
Thanks for calling.

800
01:03:17,835 --> 01:03:20,879
Thanks. Yeah.

801
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:07,759
This kid doesn't have a chance.

802
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:27,696
- What do you know about faucets?
- I know a lot about them, boy.

803
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,282
Stand aside.

804
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:34,369
- Jesus. For the love of Pete.
- What?

805
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:38,999
It must be a hundred degrees in here.
Why don't you turn on the fan?

806
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:50,468
The place is falling apart.

807
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,392
Man, where'd you get all this stuff?

808
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:01,146
- What are you talking about?
- All the tools and stuff.

809
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:05,942
Well, it may come as a surprise
to a thief...

810
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:09,321
...but I bought this stuff, everything in here,
with my own money.

811
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:11,489
Yeah, yeah. That's not what I meant.

812
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:13,950
I mean, there's just so much shit
packed in here.

813
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:18,079
Yeah. Well, every tool in here
has a purpose.

814
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:20,165
Everything has a job to do.

815
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,709
They're all to use if necessary.

816
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:25,128
Okay, so, what's that?

817
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:27,130
- That's a post-hole digger.
- That?

818
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:28,381
Vise grips.

819
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:30,133
- That?
- Wire cutters.

820
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:32,469
You know it's a trowel, come on.

821
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:34,804
Those are shears there,
and that's a saw.

822
01:05:34,972 --> 01:05:37,515
That's a tack hammer.
You can't fool me, kid.

823
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:42,437
All right, what's on your mind?

824
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:47,025
It's just, I can't afford
to buy all this stuff.

825
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:51,613
Well, I guess even a bonehead
like you could understand...

826
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,866
...that a man acquires this
over a period of 50 years.

827
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:59,162
- Yeah, but...
- All right, look, here.

828
01:05:59,872 --> 01:06:03,291
Take these three items, right here.
You can have this.

829
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:09,005
WD-40, vise grips and some duct tape.

830
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:12,884
Any man worth his salt
can do half of the household chores...

831
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:14,552
...with just those three things.

832
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,222
Anything else you need,
you just borrow it, that's all.

833
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,724
Okay. Cool.

834
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:31,444
- Fuck me.
- What's with that?

835
01:06:31,612 --> 01:06:33,738
Nothing. What?

836
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:36,408
Nothing, huh?
I just saw you coughed up blood.

837
01:06:36,575 --> 01:06:39,577
That's not good.
You should really see a doctor.

838
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:43,289
Yeah.

839
01:06:43,624 --> 01:06:45,291
Look...

840
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:50,463
...those guys who were here
the other night, on my lawn.

841
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:51,715
What about them?

842
01:06:51,882 --> 01:06:53,967
Just a gang, a bunch
of Hmong gangbangers.

843
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:57,053
Yeah, I assumed that,
but what were they doing here?

844
01:06:57,221 --> 01:06:58,972
They were gonna take me away.

845
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:03,226
They were kind of pissed
that I blew my first initiation.

846
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:09,482
Yeah. Well, you are a pussy, you know,
you wanna hang out with guys like that.

847
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:11,526
What was your initiation supposed to be?

848
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:23,455
My Gran Torino?

849
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:29,044
Christ all Friday.

850
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:48,688
Shit.

851
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,194
Toad, you got a minute?

852
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:57,864
All right. Okay.

853
01:07:58,032 --> 01:07:59,449
Here it is.

854
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:02,911
Here's the deal. I take the top
because that's the heaviest.

855
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,288
I pull on that,
and you stand right back here...

856
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:08,083
...and you push
and help me push it up each step.

857
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,210
- Just like that.
- Then let me take the top.

858
01:08:10,377 --> 01:08:11,669
No, no, I've got the top.

859
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:13,755
Really, I'll take the top.
It looks heavy.

860
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,508
Look, I'm not crippled. I've got the top.

861
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:19,260
If you don't let me take the top,
I ain't helping.

862
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:22,097
- Now, listen to me, zipperhead-
- No, you listen, old man.

863
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:26,101
I'm here because you needed help.
So it's either top or I'm out of here.

864
01:08:29,855 --> 01:08:34,943
All right. You take the top, and I'll push.

865
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:40,115
Just don't let it slip out of your
little-girl hands and crush me.

866
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,534
Don't give me any ideas, now.

867
01:08:52,753 --> 01:08:55,130
- That thing weighs a ton.
- Yeah.

868
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:59,884
It runs like a clock, though. They just
don't make them like this anymore.

869
01:09:00,052 --> 01:09:02,637
So, what are you gonna do with it?

870
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:05,056
Sell it, I guess.

871
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:07,600
How much?

872
01:09:08,435 --> 01:09:11,229
60 bucks. They...

873
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:14,774
I'm tired of having it sit around
down in the basement there.

874
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:18,278
Why? You looking for a freezer?

875
01:09:18,445 --> 01:09:20,572
The downstairs one kind of died.

876
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:23,616
Okay. 25 bucks and it's yours.

877
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:26,119
Twenty-five? But you just said 60.

878
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:29,247
I know, but this'll save me money
putting an ad in the paper.

879
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:32,709
- Come on, let's wheel it over to your place.
- All right. Okay.

880
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:40,884
- Kind of ironic, huh?
What?

881
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:44,012
Toad washing the car
that he tried to steal from you.

882
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:48,391
Yeah. He misses one spot,
he's doing it all over again too.

883
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:50,602
It's nice of you to
look after him like this.

884
01:09:50,769 --> 01:09:53,062
He doesn't have any real role models
in his life.

885
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:54,731
Well, I'm not any role model.

886
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:56,608
But you're a good man, Wally.

887
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:58,902
I wish our father
would've been more like you.

888
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:01,738
- Don't go calling me Wally.
- No, I'm serious.

889
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:05,825
He was really hard on us, really traditional,
and really old-school.

890
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:10,622
- Yeah, well, I'm old-school.
- Yeah, but you're an American.

891
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:13,583
What's that supposed to mean?

892
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:18,755
You like him, don't you?

893
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:21,549
Are you kidding? He tried to steal my car.

894
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:23,718
Uh-huh. And you spend time with him...

895
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:27,347
...teach him how to fix things,
saved him from that fucked cousin of ours.

896
01:10:27,514 --> 01:10:31,142
- Hey. Watch your language, lady.
- And you're a good man.

897
01:10:31,977 --> 01:10:34,103
I'm not a good man.

898
01:10:34,271 --> 01:10:37,607
Get me another beer, dragon lady.
This one's empty.

899
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:48,576
You know, the Hmong consider gardening
to be women's work.

900
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:53,081
Yeah. That's probably why I see you
in the garden over there all the time.

901
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:55,750
Besides, we ain't in Humong.

902
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:57,669
Funny.

903
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:03,633
You know, you should quit.
That's bad for you.

904
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:07,845
Yeah? So is being in a gang, dipshit.

905
01:11:08,013 --> 01:11:11,182
Didn't you hear what I just said?
I saw you cough up blood.

906
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:14,686
You should quit.

907
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:18,022
So, what's that emblem supposed
to mean anyway?

908
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:20,984
Is it your ancient Cub Scout emblem?

909
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:24,946
First Cavalry. I've had it since '51.

910
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,951
So, what do you want to do
with your life, kid?

911
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:34,038
Well, I was thinking about maybe sales.

912
01:11:34,206 --> 01:11:35,873
Sales, huh?

913
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:39,377
My oldest son is in sales.

914
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:44,090
- Does he do well?
- Oh, yeah. License to steal.

915
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:49,137
I work in the Ford factory for 50 years,
and he's out selling Japanese cars.

916
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,764
- You made cars?
- Yeah.

917
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:55,685
I put the steering column
in this Gran Torino...

918
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:59,647
...in 1972, right on the line.

919
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:03,151
Oh, you are old. So cool.

920
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:08,865
Yeah. So you wanna be in sales.
You thinking about going to school maybe?

921
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:13,786
- Kind of, but school costs money.
- Well, maybe you should get a job.

922
01:12:13,954 --> 01:12:18,124
You can't just sit there and spread mulch
in my garden the rest of your life.

923
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:22,920
- Well, maybe you could just pay me.
- Yeah. Very funny.

924
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:26,090
Well, what kind of job could I ever get?

925
01:12:26,258 --> 01:12:29,594
Yeah. You're right.
Nobody would ever hire you.

926
01:12:30,804 --> 01:12:32,013
Yeah, I know.

927
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:35,808
Look, I'm just kidding, zip.
I mean, you could get a job.

928
01:12:35,976 --> 01:12:38,728
- You could get a job anywhere.
- Like what?

929
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:41,522
- Well, how about construction?
- Me?

930
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:43,066
- Yeah.
- Construction?

931
01:12:43,233 --> 01:12:47,278
- You have Alzheimer's or something?
- No. You could get a job in construction.

932
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:49,781
I know people in the trades.

933
01:12:49,948 --> 01:12:53,242
Course, I have to make a little adjustment
and man you up a little bit.

934
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:56,371
- Man me up?
- Yeah.

935
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:59,957
And I think you ought to
date Miss Yum Yum too.

936
01:13:00,584 --> 01:13:03,127
Do you a little good.

937
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:07,131
You know, get a little carbon
off the valves.

938
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:14,305
Now you're just gonna learn
how guys talk.

939
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:18,309
You just listen to the way Martin
and I batter it back and forth.

940
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:20,561
- You okay? You ready?
- Sure.

941
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:22,939
All right. Let's go in.

942
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:26,234
Perfect.

943
01:13:26,985 --> 01:13:28,778
A Polack and a chink.

944
01:13:29,696 --> 01:13:32,198
How you doing, Martin,
you crazy Italian prick?

945
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:36,327
You cheap bastard, I should've known you'd
come in. I was having such a pleasant day.

946
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:39,330
What'd you do, Jew some poor blind guy
out of his money?

947
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:42,250
- Gave him the wrong change?
- Who's the Nip?

948
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:47,088
Oh, he's a pussy kid from next door.
I'm just trying to man him up a little bit.

949
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:48,881
Mm.

950
01:13:49,049 --> 01:13:52,552
You see, kid? Now, that's how guys
talk to one another.

951
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:55,054
- They do?
- What, you got shit in your ears?

952
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:59,267
Now go on out and come back in,
and talk to him like a man.

953
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:00,601
Like a real man.

954
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:04,188
- Come on, Walt.
- Come on. Get your ass out of here.

955
01:14:04,356 --> 01:14:06,274
And come on back now.

956
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:09,235
- Sorry about this.
- It's okay.

957
01:14:14,241 --> 01:14:16,117
What's up, you old Italian prick?

958
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:19,036
Get out of my shop before
I blow your head off...

959
01:14:19,204 --> 01:14:23,499
- ... you goddamn dick-smoking gook!
- Jesus Christ. Oh, shit.

960
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:25,376
Take it easy. Take it easy.

961
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:28,463
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

962
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:31,549
But that's what you said.
That what you said men say.

963
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:34,218
You don't just come in
and insult the man in his shop.

964
01:14:34,386 --> 01:14:38,181
You don't do that. What happens if you
meet some stranger and get the wrong one?

965
01:14:38,348 --> 01:14:41,934
- He's gonna blow your gook head right off.
- What should I have said, then?

966
01:14:42,102 --> 01:14:45,813
Yeah, kid, why don't you start
with "Hi" or "Hello"?

967
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:47,231
Yeah, just come in and say:

968
01:14:47,399 --> 01:14:49,400
"Sir, I'd like a haircut,
if you have time. "

969
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:51,569
Yeah, be polite, but don't kiss ass.

970
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:54,697
You could talk about
a construction job you just came from...

971
01:14:54,865 --> 01:14:57,825
...and bitch about your girlfriend
and your car.

972
01:14:57,993 --> 01:15:02,079
Son of a bitch, I just got my brakes fixed,
and those sons of bitches really nailed me.

973
01:15:02,247 --> 01:15:05,333
- I mean, they screwed me right in the ass.
Don't swear at the guy.

974
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:08,211
Just talk about people
who are not in the room.

975
01:15:08,378 --> 01:15:12,131
You could bitch about your boss making you
work overtime when it's bowling night.

976
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:15,635
Right. Or my old lady bitches
for two goddamn hours...

977
01:15:15,802 --> 01:15:19,263
...about how they don't take
expired coupons at the grocery store...

978
01:15:19,431 --> 01:15:23,809
...and the minute I turn on the game,
she starts crying how we never talk.

979
01:15:23,977 --> 01:15:26,562
You see? Now go out, come back
and talk to him.

980
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:29,232
And it ain't rocket science, for chrissake.

981
01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:34,570
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car
or a girlfriend.

982
01:15:34,738 --> 01:15:37,490
Jesus. I should've blown his head off
when I had the chance.

983
01:15:37,658 --> 01:15:38,783
Yeah. Maybe so.

984
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:42,328
Now, okay, I want you to turn around
and go outside...

985
01:15:42,496 --> 01:15:45,790
...and come back, and don't talk
about having no job...

986
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:50,169
...no car, no girlfriend,
no future, no dick.

987
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:53,214
Okay? Just turn around and go.

988
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:10,898
Excuse me, sir. I need a haircut,
if you ain't too busy.

989
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:13,985
You old Italian son-of-a-bitch
prick barber.

990
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:18,990
Boy, does my ass hurt from all the guys
at my construction job.

991
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:25,329
Fuck me.

992
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:27,999
Jesus Christ.

993
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:41,345
- All set to go through with it, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

994
01:16:41,513 --> 01:16:46,183
Don't "Yeah, yeah" me. Just say, "Yes, sir,"
and, "I'll do my best. "

995
01:16:46,351 --> 01:16:47,727
Yes. I'll do my best.

996
01:16:47,894 --> 01:16:51,022
Because when I vouch for somebody,
that means I've given my word.

997
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:55,443
- And I don't want you making me look bad.
- No, I'm good. Totally into this.

998
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:59,322
Don't lay down, either.
Just look them straight in the eye.

999
01:16:59,489 --> 01:17:01,991
And a man can tell a lot
by your handshake.

1000
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:06,037
- Here. Put those in your back pocket.
- Cool.

1001
01:17:06,204 --> 01:17:07,705
Don't blow this.

1002
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:12,793
Hey, Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon.
How the hell are you?

1003
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:16,797
- I'm shitty, but who's gonna listen?
Not me, that's for sure.

1004
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:21,218
Help yourself, there, Walt.
You dumb Polack.

1005
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:23,971
Okay, this is the kid
I was telling you about.

1006
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:28,476
Thao, this is Tim Kennedy.
He's the super on this job.

1007
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:31,896
So, what do we got here, Walt?

1008
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:36,651
Well, he knows construction,
and he's a smart kid.

1009
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:38,444
He'll do anything you need him for.

1010
01:17:38,612 --> 01:17:40,446
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1011
01:17:40,614 --> 01:17:43,866
- You speak English?
- Yes, sir.

1012
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:46,369
- Were you born here?
- You bet.

1013
01:17:46,536 --> 01:17:49,705
I see that Walt drove you here.
You got a vehicle?

1014
01:17:49,873 --> 01:17:51,957
Not at the moment.
Taking the bus for now.

1015
01:17:52,125 --> 01:17:54,752
The bus. Jesus Christ,
you don't have a car?

1016
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,170
My head gasket cracked.

1017
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:59,423
And the goddamn prick at the shop
wants to bend me over for 2100.

1018
01:17:59,591 --> 01:18:00,591
Oh, please.

1019
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:04,428
I replaced the tranny in my Tahoe,
and the sons of bitches fucked me hard.

1020
01:18:04,596 --> 01:18:08,265
- Just under 3200.
- Goddamn thieves. It ain't right.

1021
01:18:09,142 --> 01:18:10,726
You got that right.

1022
01:18:10,894 --> 01:18:15,564
Okay, come on in on Monday,
and we'll find something for you to do.

1023
01:18:16,316 --> 01:18:20,486
- Thanks, Mr. Kennedy.
- It's Tim. And what's your name again?

1024
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:23,114
- Thao.
- "Tuh," okay.

1025
01:18:23,281 --> 01:18:25,157
You owe me one, Walt.

1026
01:18:25,325 --> 01:18:28,619
Yeah. Well, I'll buy you a fruitcake
for Christmas.

1027
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:33,582
Fuck the fruitcake. How about you just
hand over them keys to that Gran Torino?

1028
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:38,212
- Why the hell does everybody want my car?
- Well, I'm not surprised.

1029
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:42,758
Yeah, you don't know the half of it.
All right, come on, zipperhead.

1030
01:18:42,926 --> 01:18:47,263
We'll let the mick stay here
and play with himself.

1031
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:08,993
What are we doing?

1032
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:13,497
What do you wanna do?
Carry your tools in a rice bag?

1033
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:25,009
Here we are. You can use one of these.

1034
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:28,179
And you'll need one of these. Here.

1035
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:31,724
I can't afford any of this.
I'll cover it.

1036
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:34,018
You can pay me back
on your first paycheck.

1037
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:37,897
Cool.
- Here. You'll need something like that.

1038
01:19:38,064 --> 01:19:41,275
Now, this is what I'm looking for.
Here, tool belt.

1039
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:43,444
- There you go.
- Not to bitch...

1040
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:45,362
...but won't I be needing some tools?

1041
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:50,034
Tools I've got, but I'm not gonna lend my
tool belt. You can pick up tools as you go.

1042
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:52,745
- I really appreciate all this.
- Forget it.

1043
01:19:52,913 --> 01:19:56,207
No. I really do. Thank you.

1044
01:20:31,952 --> 01:20:34,161
What's up, homeboy? What you doing?

1045
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:36,872
What up, man?
What you got, punk?

1046
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:40,709
- Just checking up on my little cousin.
Yeah, man.

1047
01:20:41,419 --> 01:20:45,464
- Our little cousin. What's this?
Where you coming from, man?

1048
01:20:45,632 --> 01:20:47,925
I'm coming home from work.

1049
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:50,261
Not that you guys would know
much about that.

1050
01:20:50,428 --> 01:20:51,887
So it's true. You got a job.

1051
01:20:52,055 --> 01:20:54,181
You can't just leave me alone?
- What?

1052
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:56,016
Hey, dog, check this out.

1053
01:20:57,394 --> 01:20:58,435
You scared, huh?

1054
01:20:58,603 --> 01:20:59,979
Who bought this shit for you? Your dad?

1055
01:21:00,146 --> 01:21:01,772
- What do you want?
- Your dad bought this?

1056
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:04,608
Keep your hands off my stuff.
Give me the fucking hat.

1057
01:21:04,776 --> 01:21:08,737
- Why the fuck you gotta make me look bad?
Keep your hands off my stuff!

1058
01:21:08,905 --> 01:21:10,364
Smashing's my job, man.

1059
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:14,869
- Yo, give me that.
Hey, come on. That's my stuff.

1060
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:16,871
Throw it over the fence, man, fuck it.

1061
01:21:17,622 --> 01:21:20,207
Let me go. Let me go.
Hey, you little bitch.

1062
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:22,126
Give me that, man. Give me that.

1063
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:27,965
- What's the phrase I'm looking for?
Fuck him up.

1064
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:30,551
Oh, yeah. Saving face.

1065
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:43,063
- Hey there.
- Hey. I gotta run.

1066
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:45,774
Haven't seen you in a few days.
Where you been?

1067
01:21:45,942 --> 01:21:47,818
- Been busy.
- Yeah.

1068
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:50,696
Busy, huh?

1069
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:53,991
Hey.

1070
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:57,161
- What the hell happened to you?
- Don't worry about it.

1071
01:21:57,329 --> 01:21:59,997
What do you mean, don't worry about it?
Look at your face.

1072
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:02,833
I said, don't worry about it.
Okay? It's not your problem.

1073
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:04,501
When?

1074
01:22:04,961 --> 01:22:08,464
Grabbed me a couple days ago,
right after I got off work.

1075
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:10,257
Cowards.

1076
01:22:10,675 --> 01:22:14,970
I did everything I could possibly do,
but they broke some of your tools.

1077
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:19,016
- I'll replace them.
- Don't worry about the tools.

1078
01:22:22,854 --> 01:22:25,397
Where does your cousin live?

1079
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:31,028
No, Walt. I'll be okay.

1080
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:35,199
- I don't want you to do anything.
- All right.

1081
01:22:35,992 --> 01:22:40,704
If you need any extra tools,
you just let me know.

1082
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:43,666
Well, I could use a roofing hammer.

1083
01:22:44,167 --> 01:22:47,336
Good. Go in my garage and get it.

1084
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:25,749
That should be the last of them.

1085
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:33,590
Hey.

1086
01:23:51,109 --> 01:23:55,279
All right. Here's the deal.
You stay away from Thao, understand?

1087
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:58,240
You tell your friends
to stay away from Thao.

1088
01:23:58,408 --> 01:24:01,410
If they don't listen, tell them
you don't wanna see them anymore.

1089
01:24:01,578 --> 01:24:03,287
That's it. Got it?

1090
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:05,998
I'll take that as a yes.
If I have to come back here...

1091
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:09,001
...it's gonna get fucking ugly.

1092
01:24:32,984 --> 01:24:35,319
Get out of my way.

1093
01:24:53,296 --> 01:24:57,800
How do you want your dog?
I mean, steak?

1094
01:24:57,967 --> 01:25:01,345
Funny.
- I told you, we only eat cats.

1095
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:04,223
Yeah. Well.

1096
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:06,725
Whoa. I've never
seen you like this before.

1097
01:25:06,893 --> 01:25:09,770
I'm feeling good. You know,
I got beautiful women, great food.

1098
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:13,023
And Thao.
- And even Thao isn't bugging me.

1099
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:15,400
- Having a good time, I see.
- Yeah.

1100
01:25:15,568 --> 01:25:19,446
And it never ends.
- What happened to your knuckles anyways?

1101
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:23,742
I slipped in the shower. No big problem.

1102
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:26,537
Look, now, Yum Yum,
if he doesn't ask you out...

1103
01:25:26,704 --> 01:25:28,205
...I'm gonna ask you out.

1104
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:32,626
Youa, don't listen to him, Youa.
He's a white devil.

1105
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:34,711
Yeah, I am. I'm the white devil.

1106
01:25:34,879 --> 01:25:37,548
I'd love to, Walt, but he beat you to it.

1107
01:25:37,715 --> 01:25:41,802
Really? No kidding.
Dinner and a movie or what?

1108
01:25:45,723 --> 01:25:48,225
Yeah. They're taking the bus.

1109
01:25:48,726 --> 01:25:50,602
No, you can't take the bus.

1110
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:53,564
We gotta get you something
more stylish than that.

1111
01:25:53,731 --> 01:25:56,024
Like what? Take a limo?

1112
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:58,402
How about that?

1113
01:26:02,031 --> 01:26:04,491
- The Gran Torino?
- Yeah.

1114
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:09,163
- You'd let me take the Gran Torino?
- Yeah, I'd let you take the Gran Torino.

1115
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:10,414
Really?

1116
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:14,084
Yeah, really.

1117
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:19,214
Yeah. Yeah.

1118
01:26:20,884 --> 01:26:23,177
Here's the pitch. And a strike.

1119
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:02,049
Is everybody all right?

1120
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:09,932
You're all right. You're okay.
You've got a cut.

1121
01:27:10,099 --> 01:27:13,727
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.
Where's grandma?

1122
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:18,565
Where is Sue? Where is Sue?

1123
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:21,193
- She went to our aunt's.
- Your aunt's? You sure?

1124
01:27:21,361 --> 01:27:24,655
- Yeah.
- Get on the phone and call right now.

1125
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:59,690
I knew this was gonna happen.

1126
01:28:00,191 --> 01:28:03,610
Tried to- What the hell am I doing here?

1127
01:28:03,778 --> 01:28:07,489
Well, maybe some of her friends called
and they changed plans.

1128
01:28:08,032 --> 01:28:09,741
Yeah.

1129
01:28:11,911 --> 01:28:17,874
In the war, we just lost a lot of friends,
but you're kind of set for it.

1130
01:28:18,042 --> 01:28:20,168
You're geared to it.

1131
01:29:17,268 --> 01:29:22,314
No, no, no.

1132
01:29:29,572 --> 01:29:32,574
You fuck! You rotten fuck!

1133
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:26,169
Mr. Kowalski?

1134
01:30:35,805 --> 01:30:41,143
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

1135
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:42,769
The police finally left.

1136
01:30:43,729 --> 01:30:45,439
No one's talking.

1137
01:30:45,982 --> 01:30:48,942
One thing about the Hmong,
they keep their mouths shut.

1138
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:50,694
Yeah, I've noticed that.

1139
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:02,539
You know, Thao and Sue are never
gonna find peace in this world...

1140
01:31:03,541 --> 01:31:05,041
...as long as that gang's around.

1141
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:09,880
Until they go away, you know, forever.

1142
01:31:13,342 --> 01:31:15,010
What are you saying?

1143
01:31:15,678 --> 01:31:18,054
You know what I'm saying.

1144
01:31:19,265 --> 01:31:21,391
I took Sue to the hospital.

1145
01:31:22,226 --> 01:31:26,146
She's scared. They're all scared.

1146
01:31:26,522 --> 01:31:28,023
Yeah.

1147
01:31:29,609 --> 01:31:31,067
Thao, especially.

1148
01:31:31,235 --> 01:31:34,237
He's sitting out there right now,
staring at your front door.

1149
01:31:35,698 --> 01:31:38,325
You know what he expects,
Mr. Kowalski.

1150
01:31:39,744 --> 01:31:41,369
What would you do?

1151
01:31:42,413 --> 01:31:46,750
- What should Thao do?
- I know what I would do if I was you.

1152
01:31:47,752 --> 01:31:51,922
- Or at least what you think you should do.
- Really?

1153
01:31:52,381 --> 01:31:55,592
If I was Thao,
I guess I'd want vengeance.

1154
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:59,346
I'd wanna stand shoulder to shoulder
with you and kill those guys.

1155
01:32:00,389 --> 01:32:01,765
And you?

1156
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,059
What would I do?

1157
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:09,356
I'd come over here and talk to you,
I guess.

1158
01:32:11,192 --> 01:32:14,945
I know you're close with these people,
but this pisses me off too, Mr. Kowalski.

1159
01:32:17,949 --> 01:32:19,407
Want a beer?

1160
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:21,284
I'd love one.

1161
01:32:21,452 --> 01:32:24,913
There's some in the chest
right over there behind you.

1162
01:32:50,314 --> 01:32:51,940
Damn all this.

1163
01:32:53,401 --> 01:32:57,320
- Just isn't fair.
- Nothing's fair, Father.

1164
01:33:00,658 --> 01:33:02,993
So, what are you gonna do,
Mr. Kowalski?

1165
01:33:05,079 --> 01:33:06,746
Call me Walt.

1166
01:33:07,915 --> 01:33:09,499
All right.

1167
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:12,752
What are you gonna do, Walt?

1168
01:33:13,504 --> 01:33:15,255
I don't know...

1169
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:18,008
...but I'll think of something.

1170
01:33:19,343 --> 01:33:22,887
Whatever it is,
they won't have a chance.

1171
01:33:34,650 --> 01:33:35,692
What are you doing?

1172
01:33:36,986 --> 01:33:41,114
- Thinking.
- Thinking? Thinking time is over.

1173
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:44,451
Now it's time to knock the shit
out of those pricks.

1174
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:48,872
I know you don't wanna hear this,
but now's the time to stay calm.

1175
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,082
Calm? You want me to be calm?

1176
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:56,046
We stay calm or else mistakes get made.
We have to step back from this thing.

1177
01:33:56,964 --> 01:34:00,133
No. Don't let me down, Walt. Not you.

1178
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:02,385
This is gonna end today.

1179
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:04,304
Sit down.

1180
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:07,932
- I don't wanna sit.
- I said, sit down.

1181
01:34:11,562 --> 01:34:15,899
Now, listen to me. We gotta plan this,
and plan it very carefully.

1182
01:34:16,484 --> 01:34:18,443
We can't make any mistakes.

1183
01:34:18,611 --> 01:34:21,488
Now, you know I'm the right man
for this job.

1184
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:23,907
So I want you to go home
and stay calm...

1185
01:34:24,075 --> 01:34:26,743
...and come back here
at 4 this afternoon.

1186
01:34:26,911 --> 01:34:31,915
- And what needs to be done will be done.
- I say we go now. Right now.

1187
01:34:32,083 --> 01:34:35,085
And what? Kill that cousin of yours
and the rest of those zips?

1188
01:34:35,252 --> 01:34:38,338
Mr. Tough Guy out for blood
all of a sudden?

1189
01:34:38,506 --> 01:34:40,965
You know nothing about it.

1190
01:34:43,928 --> 01:34:47,931
Now go home and you stay calm.

1191
01:34:48,099 --> 01:34:51,184
Come back here at 4. All right?

1192
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:54,896
Okay?

1193
01:34:57,233 --> 01:34:58,775
Okay.

1194
01:35:27,763 --> 01:35:31,599
Yeah. I know, I know.
Give me a break, will you?

1195
01:35:31,767 --> 01:35:34,978
It's the first time I've ever smoked
in the house.

1196
01:35:36,897 --> 01:35:40,900
Let a man enjoy himself, would you, girl?

1197
01:35:44,113 --> 01:35:46,364
All finished. Ten dollars American.

1198
01:35:46,532 --> 01:35:50,076
I don't suppose your Guinea hands
are steady enough to do a straight shave?

1199
01:35:50,244 --> 01:35:52,912
Straight shave? You've never asked
for a straight shave.

1200
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:57,125
I know, but I've always wondered about it.
That's unless you're too busy.

1201
01:35:57,293 --> 01:36:01,755
- No, just let me heat up a towel.
- Yeah. And here, here's a 20.

1202
01:36:01,922 --> 01:36:06,426
Keep the change. That's just in case
you hit my jugular.

1203
01:36:14,477 --> 01:36:17,020
It's gonna take about one hour.

1204
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:19,856
We gonna shorten the sleeves a little bit.

1205
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:22,859
Gonna fix the shoulder.

1206
01:36:23,027 --> 01:36:27,447
- Yeah. I never had a fitted suit before.
- Yes, sir.

1207
01:36:27,615 --> 01:36:31,034
- Mm-hm.
- You look very good.

1208
01:36:38,834 --> 01:36:42,295
- What can I do for you, Mr. Kowalski?
- I'm here for a confession.

1209
01:36:43,047 --> 01:36:45,048
Oh, Lord Jesus. What have you done?

1210
01:36:45,216 --> 01:36:47,967
- Nothing. You just take it easy, now.
- What are you up to?

1211
01:36:48,135 --> 01:36:50,512
Are you gonna give me a confession
or not?

1212
01:36:54,141 --> 01:36:56,351
How long has it been
since your last confession?

1213
01:36:56,519 --> 01:36:58,895
Oh, forever.

1214
01:37:00,523 --> 01:37:03,733
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

1215
01:37:03,901 --> 01:37:06,236
What are your sins, my son?

1216
01:37:07,571 --> 01:37:11,825
Well, in 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski...

1217
01:37:11,992 --> 01:37:14,661
...at the factory Christmas party.

1218
01:37:14,829 --> 01:37:18,081
Dorothy was in the other room
with the other wives.

1219
01:37:18,749 --> 01:37:20,875
It just happened.

1220
01:37:21,252 --> 01:37:23,336
Yes, go on.

1221
01:37:23,504 --> 01:37:27,257
Well, I made a 900-dollar profit
selling a boat and a motor.

1222
01:37:27,925 --> 01:37:31,344
I didn't pay the taxes.
It's the same as stealing.

1223
01:37:32,096 --> 01:37:33,930
Yes, fine.

1224
01:37:34,765 --> 01:37:36,266
Oh, lastly...

1225
01:37:37,935 --> 01:37:41,396
...I was never very close
with my two sons.

1226
01:37:42,106 --> 01:37:45,233
I don't know them. I didn't know how.

1227
01:37:47,945 --> 01:37:49,529
That's it?

1228
01:37:49,738 --> 01:37:54,951
That's it? It's bothered me
most of my life.

1229
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:59,414
Say 10 "Hail Marys"
and five "Our Fathers. "

1230
01:37:59,582 --> 01:38:04,085
God loves you and forgives you,
and I absolve you of all your sins.

1231
01:38:04,253 --> 01:38:08,631
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

1232
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:12,135
Thank you, Padre.

1233
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:18,224
Are you going to retaliate
for what happened to Sue?

1234
01:38:19,184 --> 01:38:21,561
I'm going over to that house today,
Mr. Kowalski.

1235
01:38:21,729 --> 01:38:22,770
Is that so?

1236
01:38:22,938 --> 01:38:27,150
It is. And every other day until you see
the folly in what you're planning.

1237
01:38:27,318 --> 01:38:31,654
- Busy day. Gotta go.
- Go in peace.

1238
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:35,158
Oh, I am at peace.

1239
01:38:37,661 --> 01:38:39,996
Jesus Christ.

1240
01:38:53,844 --> 01:38:56,012
So which one's mine?

1241
01:38:57,181 --> 01:39:00,350
You ever fired a weapon before?

1242
01:39:00,517 --> 01:39:02,268
No.

1243
01:39:04,521 --> 01:39:06,814
Well, why don't you put that one down?

1244
01:39:06,982 --> 01:39:09,275
And I got something I wanna show you.
Come on.

1245
01:39:09,443 --> 01:39:11,361
What?

1246
01:39:14,907 --> 01:39:20,036
1952, we were sent up to take out
a chink machine-gun nest.

1247
01:39:20,204 --> 01:39:22,288
Been shredding us up pretty good.

1248
01:39:22,456 --> 01:39:24,832
I was the only one
that came back that day.

1249
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:28,878
For that, they gave me a Silver Star.
Here it is.

1250
01:39:30,589 --> 01:39:33,549
Here. I want you to have it.

1251
01:39:34,218 --> 01:39:35,885
Why?

1252
01:39:36,053 --> 01:39:40,139
Why? Because we all knew the dangers
that night, but we went anyway.

1253
01:39:40,307 --> 01:39:42,725
That's the way it might be tonight.

1254
01:39:42,893 --> 01:39:45,061
There's always a chance
you don't come back.

1255
01:39:45,229 --> 01:39:48,564
The hell we won't. We're gonna roll up
in there and tear some ass.

1256
01:39:48,732 --> 01:39:52,402
That's foolish. That's the exact reaction
they're waiting for.

1257
01:39:52,569 --> 01:39:54,237
Go ahead and close this up.

1258
01:39:54,738 --> 01:39:57,907
- How many?
- How many what?

1259
01:39:58,283 --> 01:40:01,244
How many men did you kill in Korea?

1260
01:40:01,662 --> 01:40:06,582
- Thirteen. Maybe more.
- What was it like to kill a man?

1261
01:40:07,459 --> 01:40:09,794
You don't wanna know.

1262
01:40:10,462 --> 01:40:12,672
Now close it up.

1263
01:40:27,604 --> 01:40:31,107
Walt. Walt. What are you doing?

1264
01:40:31,942 --> 01:40:35,862
- What are you doing?
- Relax. You can't get out of there.

1265
01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:38,614
You let me out right now.
Let me out.

1266
01:40:38,782 --> 01:40:42,118
- Fucking let me out or I'll fucking kill you.
- Shut the fuck up.

1267
01:40:42,786 --> 01:40:44,829
You wanna know what it's like
to kill a man?

1268
01:40:44,997 --> 01:40:46,998
Well, it's goddamn awful,
that's what it is.

1269
01:40:47,166 --> 01:40:49,083
The only thing worse
is getting a medal...

1270
01:40:49,251 --> 01:40:53,212
...for killing some poor kid
that wanted to just give up, that's all.

1271
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:56,382
Yeah, some scared little gook
just like you.

1272
01:40:56,550 --> 01:41:00,470
I shot him in the face with that rifle
you were holding in there a while ago.

1273
01:41:00,637 --> 01:41:04,974
Not a day goes by that I don't think about it,
and you don't want that on your soul.

1274
01:41:05,142 --> 01:41:07,769
Now, I got blood on my hands.
I'm soiled.

1275
01:41:07,936 --> 01:41:11,064
That's why I'm going it alone tonight.

1276
01:41:11,231 --> 01:41:15,443
Walt. You take me with you right now.
Let me out!

1277
01:41:15,611 --> 01:41:20,323
Look, you've come a long way.
I'm proud to say that you're my friend...

1278
01:41:20,491 --> 01:41:24,327
...but you got your whole life ahead of you.
But me, I finish things.

1279
01:41:24,495 --> 01:41:28,164
That's what I do. And I'm going it alone.

1280
01:41:28,332 --> 01:41:32,376
No. Wait! Walt! Walt!

1281
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:36,255
Walt! Walt! Walt!

1282
01:41:50,521 --> 01:41:53,731
Look, I need you to watch my dog.

1283
01:41:55,526 --> 01:41:57,860
Yeah, I love you too.

1284
01:42:03,242 --> 01:42:05,785
Yeah, she's old too.

1285
01:42:06,537 --> 01:42:11,707
Bye-bye, sweetheart. Take it easy.
Her name is Daisy.

1286
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:30,351
- Hello?
It's Walt.

1287
01:42:30,519 --> 01:42:33,688
The keys to my house are under
the ceramic turtle on the porch.

1288
01:42:33,856 --> 01:42:37,650
Let yourself in. Your brother's
in the basement. I gotta go.

1289
01:42:53,917 --> 01:42:56,878
Sorry, Father, we have to go.

1290
01:42:57,045 --> 01:43:00,548
I'm telling you, if we're not here,
there will be bloodshed.

1291
01:43:00,716 --> 01:43:02,550
We've been here for hours.

1292
01:43:02,718 --> 01:43:04,969
We can't afford to anchor a unit
to one location.

1293
01:43:05,137 --> 01:43:06,596
I'm begging you to stay.

1294
01:43:07,222 --> 01:43:09,765
Just got word from my sergeant.
We're pulling the plug.

1295
01:43:10,767 --> 01:43:13,603
- I'm staying.
- No, you aren't.

1296
01:43:14,855 --> 01:43:18,774
We have specific orders. You came with us,
you're leaving with us.

1297
01:43:18,942 --> 01:43:20,776
Watch your head.

1298
01:43:30,287 --> 01:43:32,872
Sue. Over here. Over here.

1299
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:34,665
- Come unlock this.
What's going on?

1300
01:43:34,833 --> 01:43:38,794
He left without me.
He went to Smokie's without me.

1301
01:43:39,963 --> 01:43:41,797
Thao!

1302
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:08,074
What the fuck, man?

1303
01:44:11,828 --> 01:44:14,330
Any swamp rats in there?

1304
01:44:15,249 --> 01:44:17,959
- I didn't think your ass would've came.
- Shut up, gook.

1305
01:44:19,127 --> 01:44:22,838
I got nothing to say to you,
shrimp-dick midget like you.

1306
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:30,805
Yeah, yeah. You go ahead,
watch out for your boyfriend.

1307
01:44:30,973 --> 01:44:35,601
Because it was either he or you or someone
who raped one of their own family.

1308
01:44:35,769 --> 01:44:38,020
Your own blood, for chrissake.

1309
01:44:39,022 --> 01:44:42,900
Now, go ahead and pull those pistols
like miniature cowboys.

1310
01:44:43,068 --> 01:44:45,194
- Go ahead.
- So where's Thao at?

1311
01:44:45,362 --> 01:44:49,240
- That pussy motherfucker couldn't come?
- Don't worry about Thao.

1312
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:52,493
Thao's got not one second for you.

1313
01:44:53,245 --> 01:44:56,455
Says who? You?

1314
01:44:57,124 --> 01:44:59,166
What the fuck you gonna do, old man?

1315
01:45:02,337 --> 01:45:03,379
What you gonna do...

1316
01:45:03,547 --> 01:45:05,047
- ... punk ass old man?
Bitch.

1317
01:45:05,924 --> 01:45:09,051
- Kind of jumpy, aren't we?
- Shut the fuck up.

1318
01:45:09,219 --> 01:45:11,178
You shut the fuck up.

1319
01:45:22,649 --> 01:45:25,401
- Got a light?
What the fuck?

1320
01:45:29,406 --> 01:45:31,198
No.

1321
01:45:32,075 --> 01:45:35,745
Me. I've got a light.

1322
01:45:39,541 --> 01:45:41,709
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1323
01:46:47,734 --> 01:46:50,152
- Yes, Sergeant.
What happened?

1324
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:52,488
- You need to step back.
- He's a friend of mine.

1325
01:46:52,656 --> 01:46:54,532
I said, step back.

1326
01:46:55,742 --> 01:46:57,993
Hey, did you hear him? Step back.

1327
01:46:58,161 --> 01:47:00,496
- What happened?
- Hey, step back.

1328
01:47:01,665 --> 01:47:02,832
He's my friend.

1329
01:47:03,125 --> 01:47:04,500
Please, it's important.

1330
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:08,087
He went for his lighter and they shot him.

1331
01:47:08,255 --> 01:47:10,840
He didn't even have a gun on him.

1332
01:47:13,718 --> 01:47:15,344
This time we have witnesses.

1333
01:47:15,637 --> 01:47:17,388
These guys will be locked up
for a long time.

1334
01:47:17,556 --> 01:47:19,348
Officer Chang! Get those people back.

1335
01:47:19,516 --> 01:47:22,560
You have to step back now, okay?

1336
01:47:41,413 --> 01:47:43,998
Get them the fuck out of here.
Get them out of here.

1337
01:49:22,681 --> 01:49:27,309
Walt Kowalski once said to me that I
didn't know anything about life or death...

1338
01:49:27,477 --> 01:49:31,939
...because I was an over-educated,
27-year-old virgin...

1339
01:49:32,107 --> 01:49:35,985
...who held the hands of superstitious old
women and promised them eternity.

1340
01:49:37,904 --> 01:49:40,781
Walt definitely had no problem
calling it like he saw it...

1341
01:49:41,533 --> 01:49:43,659
...but he was right.

1342
01:49:43,827 --> 01:49:48,998
I knew really nothing about life or death
until I got to know Walt.

1343
01:49:50,041 --> 01:49:52,084
And, boy, did I learn.

1344
01:49:58,717 --> 01:50:02,678
"And I wanna leave my house to the church
because Dorothy would've liked it. "

1345
01:50:06,057 --> 01:50:08,642
Now, which brings us to our last item,
and again...

1346
01:50:08,810 --> 01:50:11,645
...please excuse the language
in Mr. Kowalski's will.

1347
01:50:11,813 --> 01:50:14,607
I'm simply reading it
the way it was written.

1348
01:50:16,026 --> 01:50:21,655
"And I'd like to leave
my 1972 Gran Torino...

1349
01:50:26,202 --> 01:50:28,329
...to my friend...

1350
01:50:29,539 --> 01:50:32,875
...Thao Vang Lor...

1351
01:50:33,043 --> 01:50:37,212
...on the condition that you don't chop-top
the roof like one of those beaners...

1352
01:50:37,380 --> 01:50:42,468
...don't paint any idiotic flames on it
like some white-trash hillbilly...

1353
01:50:42,636 --> 01:50:45,095
...and don't put a big, gay spoiler
on the rear end...

1354
01:50:45,263 --> 01:50:47,973
...like you see
on all the other zipperheads' cars.

1355
01:50:48,141 --> 01:50:49,600
It just looks like hell.
