00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,640
<i>If you have just tuned in
to this special bulletin,</i>

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,270
<i>Washington has confirmed
that, yesterday,</i>

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,250
<i>on the fourth
of October, 1957,</i>

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,620
<i>the Soviet Uni√≥n
successfully launched...</i>

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,950
<i>history's first
man-made satellite...</i>

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,250
<i>into space orbit
around the Earth.</i>

9
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,430
<i>The satellite which the Russians
have dubbed Sputnik...</i>

10
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,830
is being hailed
as a milestone in history.

11
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,740
No one in our nation's capital
could deny that the satellite...

12
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,710
<i>has ushered in a grim
new chapter in the Cold War.</i>

13
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,140
<i>And indeed,
a wave of national anxiety...</i>

14
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,150
already seems
to be sweeping the country.

15
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,340
<i>Still maintaining its speed
of 18,000 miles an hour,</i>

16

<i>Chief Engineer of the Army

19
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,130
<i>expressed the hope
that the United States...</i>

20
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,540
<i>would soon be following
the Russians into space...</i>

21
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,800
<i>with our own
artificial satellite.</i>

22
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,810
Doctor von Braun confirmed...

23
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,710
that there has still been
no actual sighting
of the Soviet satellite,

24
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,840
<i>but the U.S. Expects
to be tracking it very soon.</i>

25
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,750
<i>We are told that Sputnik will be
visible to the naked eye...</i>

26
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,260
about an hour after sunset
and an hour before dawn,

27

as it traverses the October sky
over the United States.

28
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,120
What the beeping signal means
we still don't know.

29
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,130
It may be nothing more...

30

<i># Warden threw a party

It's almost 9:00.

No kiddin'. There are easier
ways to commit suicide, Homer.

34
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,720
Will you just step on it,
Roy Lee?

35
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,890

Let's see what you got.

39

46
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,750
but you gotta know
when to quit.

47
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,080

No.</i>

any more pillars?
- Uh, he didn't say.

59
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,930
Does he talk at all?

60
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,170
Oh, yeah. He talks.

I'm sorry, John.

00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,230
That's my dad.

78
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,240
Homer.

79
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,410
Well, how'd it go?

80
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,880
Well, I told you. You spend
the summer shovelin' coal,

81
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,610
and you'll be playin'
linebacker next fall.

82
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,750
What's the matter, Homer?
Not cut out for mining coal?

83
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,790
Me neither.

84
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,020
Hey, let's get that mess
cleaned up!

85

Let's get some cribbin'
on that roof!

86
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,200
Buck up, Homer.
You're a Coalwood boy.

87
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,070
When you get down in the mine,
get that coal shovel
in your hand,

88
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,570
feel just as natural to you
as a tick on a dog.

89
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,540
<i>And get that slate
off the loader!</i>

90
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,840
<i>It's
the radio signal transmitted
by the Soviet Sputnik.</i>

91
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,350
Listen now for the sound
which forevermore separates
the old from the new.

92
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,660
<i>That's it?
That's the Sputnik?</i>

93
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,460
<i>- That's Sputnik.
- Well, big deal.</i>

94
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,700
Big deal?
What you fail to grasp...

95
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,710
is that the sound you're hearin'
is bein' transmitted...

96
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,540
by an object that is travelin'
at 18,000 miles per hour,

97
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,130
<i>559 miles high,</i>

00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,450

<i>Sputnik is a milestone

104
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,230
What do you think
about that, Homer?
Well, yes, ma'am. Uh...

105
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,270
<i>Cat got your tongue?</i>

106
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,630
We were talkin'
about bein' in orbit,

107
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,070
hundreds of miles
away from the Earth.

108
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,800
You know anything
about that?

109
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,100
No, ma'am.

110
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,670
I got my eye on you, boy.

111
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,770
<i>Now who can tell me
why Sputnik is so important?</i>

112
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,580
<i>We ought to just shoot
the damn thing down.</i>

113
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,920
It's got one of them
little spy cameras in it.

114
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,220
It takes pictures of every one
of our missile bases.

115
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:45,560
This country'd better get on
the ball before it's too late.

116
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,890
<i>All I know is this Sputnik
had better show up soon.</i>

117
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,960
I'm gettin' a crick
in my neck.

118
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,730
<i>All right. What you need to do
is take her to the movies.</i>

119
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,830
<i>Somethin'scary, like
Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man.</i>

120
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:01,040
Then you take your arm
and put it up round the back
of her chair, like so.

121
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,310
Now when it gets real scary,
and she ain't payin' attention
to nothin' but the movie,

122
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:09,280
you sort of let your arm sort
of slide on down her shoulder,

123
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:12,620
real nice and slow
and easy...

124
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,620
until...

125
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,890
Hey! Hey!

126
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,190
<i>I see it!

00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,820
<i>You seein'things, Carl?</i>

128
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,800
I see it.
Where do you see it?

129
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,140
I see it.
It's right there.

130
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,950
Wow.

131
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,560
<i>Son ofbitches
gonna be droppin'bombs
on us from up there.</i>

132
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,070
Don't know why they'd drop
a bomb on this place.

133
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,570
Be a heck of a waste
of a bomb.

134
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,210
The first game against Welch...

135
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,270
that's the one that's
gonna draw the scouts.

136
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,180
Yeah. Welch knows it too.
They're gonna be coming
after us.

137
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,940
Well, y'all be careful, Jim.
Last year, those two boys from
Welch got their arms broken.

138
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,220
Well, they started it.

139
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,280
It don't matter much
who started it.
I don't call that football.

140
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,520
You don't worry about Jim.

141
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:28,050
Ain't nobody on the Welch team
that can catch him.

142
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:32,190
<i>I wish the scouts could've seen
that first game with Bluefield.
I'm gonna build a rocket.</i>

143
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,960
<i>Like Sputnik.</i>

144
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,200
Well, I'm not sayin' it's gonna
go up in space or anything,

145
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,210
but I'm gonna do it.

146
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,440
I'm gonna build a rocket.

147
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,710
Well, just don't
blow yourself up.

148
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,580
<i>More eggs, anybody?</i>

149
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,650
Nice rocket, Homer.
How high do you think
it will fly?

150
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,160
Well, I got it packed with
the powder from 30 sky rockets.

151
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,160
Three, four miles.

152
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,960
<i>You ready?
Yeah.</i>

153
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,900
Yeah.
Ten, nine...

154
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:13,240
<i>Eight, seven, six...
Should we get behind somethin'?</i>

155
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,340
Wh-What happened?

156
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,250
<i>My rocket blew up.
- Are you okay?</i>

157
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,340
- I guess.
- My heart's poundin'.

158
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,980
I thought the mine blew up.
Oh, Homer.

159
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,030
I waited six months for
the company carpenter to get
around puttin' up that fence.

160
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,330
Didn't I tell you
not to blow yourself up?

161
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,920
Yes, ma'am.

162
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,200
Then let's not.

163
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,610
<i>Elsie.
It's all right, Ms. Fields!</i>

164
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,970
<i>It's all right.</i>

165
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,810
<i>Dear Dr. Von Braun,</i>

166
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,820
<i>Six, five, four, three...
My name is Homer Hickam.</i>

167
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,380
<i>Two, one...
I'm 17 and I live in a small
mining town in West Virginia.</i>

168
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,420
Ignition.

169
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,050
Liftoff. Liftoff.

170
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,790
<i>I'm writing to offer
my condolences to you
and your team...</i>

171
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,190
<i>on your recent attempt
to launch the Vanguard rocket.</i>

172
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:15,400
<i>I also had a disastrous
occurrence during the launch
of my own small rocket.</i>

173
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,540
<i>Since here in Coalwood,
everyone's much more
interested...</i>

174
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:24,080
<i>in what's down below the earth
than what's above it,</i>

175
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,010
<i>there isn't a whole lot
of material to be found
on the subject of rocketry.</i>

176
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,420
<i>So I've been kind of stumbling
around in the dark.</i>

177
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,180
<i>#Don't you give me
no dirty look #</i>

178
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:39,320
<i># Your father's hip
He knows what cooks #</i>

179
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:43,190
<i>#Just tell your hoodlum
friend outside #</i>

180
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,600
<i># You ain't got time
to take a ride #</i>

181
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,930
<i># Yakety yak
Don't talk back #</i>

182
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,700
<i># Yakety yak, yakety yak ##
You can't be seen
with him, Homer.</i>

183
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,760
<i>He's a weirdo.
You go ahead,</i>

184
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,110
but you can kiss
your social life good-bye.

185
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,180
Hi, Homer.
Hi.

186
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,230
I don't let anybody
copy my homework.

187
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,890
I don't wanna copy
your homework.

188
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,630
Um,

189
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,730
do you know anything
about rockets?

190
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,360
Of course I do.

191
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,240
Uh, you wanna come with me
over to the library?

192
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,280
No.

193
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,150
What do you wanna know
about rockets?

194
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,820
Everything.

195
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:58,400
Well, rocketry was actually
invented by the Chinese
as early as 1,000 A.D.

196
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,630
And, supposedly,
they were quite sophisticated.

197
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,810
Potassium chlorate and sulphur.

198
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,050
Uh, well,
what'd you use?

199
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,780
Uh, somethin' like that.

200
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,020
<i>Hey, Quentin, this is great.</i>

201
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,960
This is exactly... We have
everything we need in here.

202
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,960
Roy Lee,
drive me to my house.

203
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:27,060
<i>We can use my basement.
Yeah, at least nobody'll
see us down there.</i>

204
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,760
Go, go, go.

205
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,710
<i>Come on.
You got a loose choke cable.</i>

206
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,710
You hear that?

207
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,010
The butterfly valve
isn't closin' all the way.

208
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,910
Uh, last year I built
an internal combustion engine...

209
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,110
and entered it
in the science fair.

210
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,990
<i>Yeah, well, you wouldn't happen
to have it on you, would you?</i>

211
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,990
<i># Gonna find her #</i>

212
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,660
<i># Gonna find her #</i>

213
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,670
<i># Gonna find her #</i>

214
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:03,030
<i># Gonna find her #
# Yeah #</i>

215
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,270
<i>#I've been searchin'#</i>

216
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,000
<i># Uh, I'm searchin'#</i>

217
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,070
<i># Oh, yeah, searchin'#</i>

218
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,910
<i>#Every which way #</i>

219
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,920
<i>Ow!
# Oh, yeah #
I'm sorry.</i>

220
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,650
<i>#Searchin'#</i>

221
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,280
<i>#I'm searchin'#
You missed a spot.</i>

222
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,660
<i>#Searchin'every which way #</i>

223
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,060
<i>#But I'm like that... ##</i>

224
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,290
This thing's startin'
to look like a rocket.

225
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,670
Listen to this.
"Weld the washer
to the base of the rocket body,

226
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,610
creating a combustion chamber
and nozzle."

227
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,700
We don't know how to weld.
Weld.

228
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,680
Homer,
your brother's in metal shop.
Maybe he could, uh...

229
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,580
<i>- Do we really need
this nozzle thing?
- For cryin'out loud,</i>

230
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,890
the nozzle's
the most important part.

231
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,720
<i>It directs the flow
of the hot gases!
Hey, cool it, Quentin.</i>

232
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,280
<i>Man, talkin'about
your hot gases.</i>

233
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:12,160
I don't think your father
would like you sneaking up in
the middle of the night in here.

234
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,270
And I know that he wouldn't
like me welding for you
on company time.

235
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,740
Well, what if I paid
the company for your time?

236
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,210
Homer, I can't.

237
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,750
I would lose my job.

238
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,790
I'm sorry.

239
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,120
<i>Did you see Sputnik go over
the other night?
Nah.</i>

240
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:36,230
'Cause it was beautiful.

241
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,530
I stood there and watched it
streak across the sky.

242
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,440
And anywhere in the worid,
someone could look up
and see exactly what I saw.

243
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:49,770
For once, it felt like Coalwood
was part of the outside worid.

244
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,040
Homer, believe me,
there are much worse places
than Coalwood in this worid.

245
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,140
Besides, this is just
a flying piece of steel.

246
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,450
You know, a rocket
took it up there, Mr. Bykovsky.

247
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,760
I don't know. L...

248
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,320
When I was workin'
on this rocket, I felt like,

249
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,860
I felt like I was,
like I was Wernher von Braun.

250
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,930
Let me see.

251
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,710
Homer,

252
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,340
it will be our secret.

253
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,980
Mr. Bykovsky did
a dang good job on this.

254
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,640
Yeah, well,
he used a washer for the weld.

255
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,450
Man, it looks just like it did
in the picture.
Prodigious.

256
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,460
When, uh,
when do we go?

257
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,460
Give me that.
Uh, Saturday...

258
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,690
What is this,
a weapon of some kind?

259
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,990
<i>No, sir. It's a,
it's a rocket.</i>

260
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,800
I don't allow dangerous devices
on school grounds.

261
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:50,960
Mr. Turner, I asked Homer
to bring that to school.
To show it in class.

262
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,530
You know, the boys are
thinkin' about enterin'
that county science fair.

263
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,480
<i>Be careful, gentlemen.
I'm gonna have my eye on you.</i>

264
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,410
Thank you, Mr. Turner.

265
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,610
That science fair is rigged.
All the judges are from Welch,

266
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,180
so only the kids from Welch
ever win.

267
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,020
And besides,
science fairs are for geeks.

268
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,030
No offense, Quentin.

269
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,030
Well, it's too bad
you feel that way.

270
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,930
You know, the winners go on
to the National Science Fair
in Indianapolis,

271
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,530
and colleges from all over the
country hand out scholarships.

272
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,660
It's great.
Have a good lunch, boys.

273
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,610
College scholarships
for winning a science fair?

274
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,610
Well, maybe
it's not for you.

275
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,740
W- W-Well,
what do you mean?
Homer, you got a great mind.

276
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:39,150
But science requires math,
which has never been one
of your favorite subjects.

277
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:44,060
Can't just dream your way
out of Coalwood, Homer.

278
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,330
<i>Auk I.
Stroke of genius, Homer.</i>

279
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,530
It won't fly unless somebody
lights the fuse.

280
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,800
What the hell is auk?

281
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,930
It's a bird that don't fly.

282
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,240
What, kind of like
a parakeet?

283
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,110
Ready?

284
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:08,740
Well, Youngstown's
always been fair, Otis,

285
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,580
But you're askin' me to lay off
damn near half the town.

286
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,990
The mine
is just not producin'...

287
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,120
the way it was
ten years ago, John.

288
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,130
<i>We're payin'the same labor
for half the tonnage.</i>

289
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,460
What if we were
to open up a new shaft?

290
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,900
<i>That coal is down there, Otis.</i>

291
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,660
<i>You just, you just
let me go after it.</i>

292
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,000
The Coalwood mine
is givin' out, Mr. Hickam.

293
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,680
Move!

294
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,120
Ten...
Nine, eight,

295
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,310
seven, six, five,

296
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,120
four, three, two...

297
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:55,950
Uh-oh.
Holy shit,
it's headed for the mine!

298
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,130
- I told you we didn't know
what we were doin'!

299
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,140
I told you!
Oh, no. Oh, no.

300
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,710
<i>I don't believe this.
Go ahead.</i>

301
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,440
<i>God in heaven, I thought
it was a guided missile!</i>

302
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,490
<i>I thought the damn Russians
were attackin'us.</i>

303
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,620
<i>The boy's in trouble now.</i>

304
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,320
So this is what you been up to
in the basement, huh?

305
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,430
Yes, sir.
Damn, Homer.

306
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,030
You could've killed somebody
with this idiot thing.

307
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,040
I know, sir.
I'm sorry. I was...

308
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,910
Well, Homer here
wants to be a rocket scientist.
Is that it, John?

309
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,910
He has no idea
what he wants to be.

310
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:48,040
But I know what he is.
He's a menace,

311
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,050
and he's a damn thief.

312
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,050
Dad...
And so is whoever
helped you.

313
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,420
Ike Bykovsky did this,
didn't he?

314
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,890
Don't you ever
let me catch you...

315
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,490
with these fool things
on company property again,
you understand me?

316
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,770
Yes, sir.
Then go home.

317
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:24,720
Yeah?
What's your tunnel number?

318
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:29,380
He called me a thief, Ma,
in front of everybody.

319
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,120
I mean, how could he do that?
He was dead wrong
callin' you that.

320
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,130
He'd never have done that
to Jim.

321
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,320
They could catch Jim
stickin' up the company store,

322
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,230
and Dad would probably laugh
and say, "That's my boy."

323
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,700
I know he's hard to understand
sometimes, Homer,

324
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,710
but you have to know
he loves you.

325
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,300
He loves the mine...

326
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,310
more than Jim even.

327
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,370
<i>More than you.
You hush up.</i>

328
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:56,610
What's it given him back?

329
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,980
Nothin' but a spot on his lung
the size of a damn quarter.

330
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,920
You don't know
what the mine gives me.

331
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,620
You don't know
'cause you're still a boy.

332
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,760
<i>But, by golly, you're gonna
find out soon enough.</i>

333
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,080
I'm never goin' down there.

334
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,520
You better have a talk
with your son, Elsie,

335
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,420
<i>'cause he's out of control.</i>

336
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:55,270
Where's my rocket stuff?
Right where they belong.

337
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:20,070
Quentin, you know, that rocket
went up at least 100 feet.

338
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,070
More like 200.

339
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,800
God...

340
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:30,680
Man, will you cut it out,
Roy Lee?
Die, you son of a bitch.

341
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,270
Come on.
My turn now.
Hey, man. What's with you?

342
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,440
Man, we should be tryin'
to get in that science fair...

343
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,640
instead of sittin' around here
like a bunch of hillbillies.

344
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,380
<i>I got some really
bad news for you, Homer.
We are a bunch of hillbillies.</i>

345
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,550
Besides, um, didn't your dad
say no more rockets?

346
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,490
No. He said no more rockets
on company property.

347
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,030
Do you realize
how far we'd have to go
to get off company property?

348
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,030
Yeah. We have
to go to Snakeroot.

349
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,430
Snakeroot?
That's eight miles.

350
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,630
<i>It's not that far.
I mean, we could walk
if we have to.</i>

351
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,070
Oh, walk.
That's a fantastic idea.

352
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,870
Let's go! Come on!
Wake the hell up,
will ya, Homer?

353
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,210
I got about as much chance
of winnin' that science fair...

354
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,550
as you do winnin'
a football scholarship.

355
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,550
I know I'm gonna be
a miner.

356
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,050
I've known my entire life.

357
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,060
What the hell's so bad
about minin' coal?

358
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,060
Nothin', Roy Lee.
Coal minin's great.

359
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:22,460
That's why your stepdaddy's
the biggest drunk
in West Virginia.

360
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:26,800
I mean, come on, guys!
You know the mine'll kill ya.

361
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:29,700
Did you ever hear the story
about how O'Dell's dad died?

362
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:33,230
- Homer,
will you forget it, man?
- Shut up, Homer.

363
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:37,110
<i>Apiece of slate
caught him right in the neck
and cut his head clear off.</i>

364
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,370
Bitch! Come on!

365
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,940
O'Dell!

366
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,990
Get off of me!

367
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,920
Hey, fellas.
We're lookin' for U.S. 52.

368
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,220
Uh, fellas?

369
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:59,060
Uh, just, uh, stay left
at the fork. It's about another
five miles straight ahead.

370
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,000
Thanks.

371
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:11,340
You fellas see the way
she was lookin' at me?

372
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:16,850
Man, you all wanna
be coal miners,

373
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,350
you all go ahead
and be coal miners.

374
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:33,560
There. There.

375
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,620
God's honest truth, Homer,

376
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,850
what are the chances...

377
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,150
of a bunch of kids
from Coalwood...

378
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:57,020
actually winnin'
the National Science Fair?

379
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:59,360
A million to one, O'Dell.

380
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:02,190
That good?

381
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,790
Well, why didn't you say so?
Come on. Give me that.

382
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,640
Quentin.

383
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,470
What?

384
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,230
We hiked eight miles
for this?

385
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,070
Oh, it's great.
What should we call it?

386
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,070
How 'bout a slack dump?

387
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,040
<i>What about "No Man's Land"?</i>

388
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:52,580
Cape Coalwood.

389
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:55,140
I mean, it's perfect.

390
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,510
We could build a blockhouse
over there...

391
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,520
and, and a, and a,
and a launchpad.

392
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,020
<i>And we could even build
a test stand!</i>

393
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,800
<i>Dear Dr. Von Braun,</i>

394
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,240
<i>our launch site,
which we've named Cape Coalwood,</i>

395
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,440
<i>is nearing completion.</i>

396
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,940
<i>Thanks to the generosity
oflocal businesses.
# Come on, baby #</i>

397
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,880
<i>#Let the good times roll #</i>

398
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,150
<i># Come on, baby
Let the good time roll #</i>

399
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,150
<i>#Roll all night long ##</i>

400
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,930
<i>Inspired by our efforts,</i>

401
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:42,900
<i>everyone is anxious to help
by donating materials.</i>

402
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,800
<i>We've been fortunate to have
the support of our classmates.</i>

403
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,390
<i>And the whole community
here in Coalwood is behind us.</i>

404
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:53,030
Hey, rocket boy.
Mars is that way.

405
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,910
<i>But no one has been more
encouraging to our efforts
than my father.</i>

406
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,140
No, the company doesn't have
any cement left over
for launchpads.

407
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,150
I just thought I'd ask.

408
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,340
Besides, I told you
no more rockets.

409
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:08,620
Uh, you said no more rockets
on company property.

410
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,850
And Olga
doesn't own Snakeroot.

411
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,790
So, you walk eight miles?

412
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,800
Yes, sir.

413
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,370
Well, tell me something,
Homer.

414
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,730
Uh, what exactly is
this Wernher von Braun...

415
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,470
and the rest of those Germans
accomplishin' anyway?

416
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:31,000
'Cause if you ask me,
it's nothin' but a stunt.

417
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,880
You think, you think catchin' up
to the Russians in space
is a stunt?

418
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,040
When the novelty wears off,
they're all gonna be
sent packin'.

419
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,950
<i>Maybe then they'll have
to find themselves a real job.
Like minin' coal?</i>

420
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,060
You listen here.

421
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:49,360
The coal we mine
makes steel, Homer.

422
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,870
And if steel fails,
this country fails.

423
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:55,600
If you had half a damn brain
in your head, you'd know that.

424
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:02,610
Well, who's down there now?

425
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,340
Hold on just a second.
Hey, listen here.

426
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:08,470
I had an engineer estimate
a new walkway.

427
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:11,020
<i>They had some cement left over,</i>

428
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:13,610
<i>so it got caught in the rain...
it's probably ruined.</i>

429
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:16,420
But if you wanna haul it out,
it's all yours.

430
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,420
Thanks, Dad.

431
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,690
<i>I'll be down there
in a minute.</i>

432
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:30,500
And Miss Riley wanted
to make sure you document
your results.

433
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:32,940
You will be graded
when she returns.

434
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:35,100
You have one hour.

435
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,150
Potassium chloride
has a potassium atom.

436
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:42,150
If we mix it with sugar
and add heat,

437
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,950
we'll get three parts oxygen,
two parts carbon dioxide,

438
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,250
along with some
other by-products.

439
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,720
In other words, lots
of good expanding gases.

440
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:52,450
It should make
an excellent propellant.

441
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,720
It smells like candy. Ooh!

442
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,730
<i>Better get started.</i>

443
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,930
All right, quick.
Get rid of it.

444
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,790
<i># Only you #</i>

445
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,600
Mr. Bolden, have you seen
Mr. Bykovsky around?

446
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,300
He's not in the shop anymore.

447
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,640
Your dad sent him down
to the mine.

448
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:45,270

00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:49,750
He's takin' it out on you
because you helped me.

450
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:53,410
That's enough of that.
Your father is a fair man.

451
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:56,350
If he's strict,
it's because he has to be.

452
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,820
Besides, he did me a big favor,
transferring me from
the machine shop.

453
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,830
What are you talkin' about?

454
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,460
I can make twice
as much money down there
working the high coal.

455
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:07,060
You can?

456
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:10,870
I've got relatives in Europe
who've had hard time recovering
from the war.

457
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,700
They depend on me
for whatever I can provide.

458
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,900
So, believe me,
I can use the extra money.

459
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,910
I'm just sorry
I won't be able to weld
any more rockets for you.

460
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,780
That's for good luck.

461
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:30,490
May-Maybe you could teach me
how to weld.

462
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,960
Welding
is very difficult, Homer.
I could learn.

463
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,330
You don't give up,
do you?

464
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,700
I can't.

465
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,550
<i>Come on, son.
Hi, Mr. Bolden.</i>

466
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:02,520
Hey, Homer.
I heard you tellin' Ike...

467
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:05,420
you were gonna be shootin' off
another rocket up here today.

468
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:09,090
<i>I, I thought that might
be somethin'we'd like to see.</i>

469
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,600
Whoa!

470
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,090
<i>Eight, seven,</i>

471
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:18,330

473
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,700
Hey, look out!

474
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,110
<i>Mr. Bolden!</i>

475
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:33,410
Mr. Bolden,
are you okay?

476
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,580
I'm all right.

477
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:40,390
I'm sorry about that, sir.
Oh, that's all right.
That's all right.

478
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:44,520
Homer, I flew with the Red Tails
in Worid War II.

479
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,960
And seein' that rocket
come at me...

480
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,200
it almost
took me back there.

481
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,710
Hey, let me have
a look at that thing.

482
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,210
That's a good job
on the weld, Homer,

483
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:01,440
but the heat from the exhaust
melted the washer.

484
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,470
It's referred to
as a nozzle... uh, sir.

485
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:08,890
Son, you can call it
whatever you wanna call it,

486
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,420
but you're gonna have to have
a better steel that can take
the heat.

487
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:17,620
Now I'd say S.A.E. 10-20 bar
stock ought to do you fine.

488
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,190
And I can order it for you.
Well, that'd be great,
Mr. Bolden.

489
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:25,900
But it's kind of expensive.
Um...

490
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:29,700
Twelve miles of scrap iron,
and all we gotta do
is pop it loose.

491
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:33,180
Yeah. Now what are we gonna
tell the railroad when they
catch us pryin' up the track?

492
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:36,840
<i>It's abandoned.
See, the county's covered
with abandoned spur lines.</i>

493
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,650
<i>A mine shuts down,
the track just rusts over.</i>

494
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:47,620
<i>$8.20.</i>

495
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,720
This is worth eight twenty?

496
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,430
A ton.

497
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,990
Come on.

498
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,800
Go, go!
This thing weighs a ton
all by itself!

499
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,810
Four-hundred pounds.

500
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,440
Four-hundred pounds?

501
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,680
All right.

502
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,880
O'Dell, you're sayin' this thing
is worth a buck 65?

503
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,390
Woo-hoo!

504
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,730
Whoa.

505

O'Dell?

506
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:49,210
L- It's abandoned.
Uh, look at the rust.

507
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:52,990
Caretta number two
shut down in '51.

508
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,390
Shit!

509
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,190
Get it up! Get it up!
Just get it up!

510
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,730
Give me a hand, man.
Come on!

511
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:09,300

I'm concerned that the mass

540
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:50,400
compared to the mass
of the empty rocket
will be too little.

541
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,270
Uh, he's afraid
it'll be too heavy.

542
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,370
Why don't we just
make it longer?

543
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:59,010
Longer would allow increased
volume for the propellant
without much additional mass.

544
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,020
Great idea.

My guess is, is we're gettin'
air pockets in the body
of the propellant.

560
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,280
When the fire hits 'em,
they act like little
combustion chambers.

561
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,840
I think we're gonna need
a liquid binder of some sort.

562
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:08,250
What about gasoline?
That's a good idea.

00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,720
That's real funny, Jim.

600
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:43,030
<i>Hey, Homer. Come on.
We don't got all day.</i>

601
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:47,210
Shut up, Jim.
Homer, everything ready?

602
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,210
Wait, wait.
What?
What do you mean, wait?

603
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,840
<i>Where are you goin'?</i>

604
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:07,260
<i>Hurry up, y'all.</i>

605
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:10,500
All right. It won't fly unless
somebody pulls the string.

606
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,770
Ten...
Nine, eight,

607
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,310
<i>seven, six,</i>

608
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,150
<i>five, four...</i>

609
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:31,550
Oh, my God!

610
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,780
<i>That's great!</i>

611
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:59,740
Homer,
that was unbelievable!
Let's go, Dorothy.

612
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,690
I'll tell you
what's unbelievable...

613
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,920
<i>the captain of the football team
bein' jealous of you.</i>

614
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:08,430
What you think about gettin'
in that science fair now?

615
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,290
I think we got a chance.

616
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,300
<i>Well, bless her heart.</i>

617
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:21,070
<i>Aunt Joanne hasn't seen you
in about a year and a half.</i>

618
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:24,040
<i>You look like a sausage.
- He does not.</i>

619
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:28,170
Happy birthday, Homer.

620
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:31,010
It'll stretch some
when you wear it.

621
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,880
You be sure and send her
a nice thank you note now.
All right.

622
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,720
John?
Huh?

623
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:40,280
Oh, happy birthday, Homer.

624
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,300
And I got this in the mail.

625
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,160
Must be a present
from Grandma.

626
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:48,170
What's this?

627
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,000
Oh, it's
an autographed picture.

628
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:59,340
Of Grandma?
Rather get socks.
Wernher von Braun.

629
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:02,380
Well, wonder how he knew
it was your birthday.

630
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:04,380
<i>I don't reckon he did.</i>

631
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:08,650
"Dear Homer, congratulations
on your rocket building.

632
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,660
<i>Continue your education
and maybe one day..."</i>

633
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,220
Boy, you better take an interest
in your own damn town.

634
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:16,230
<i>Instead of wastin'your time,</i>

635
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,600
<i>worryin'about Wernher von Braun
and, uh, uh, Cape Canaveral.</i>

636
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:23,100
John, it's his birthday.

637
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,570
All right, Homer. Uh...

638
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:39,880
<i>Yeah?</i>

639
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:42,440
Homer, there's strike talk
startin' up again.

640
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,680
Your father's...
Yeah, he's got a lot
on his mind.

641
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,490
Yeah, well,
I don't give a damn.

642
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,430
"Principles
of Guided Missile Design."

643
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,900
<i>I had
Miss Waters order it for you
a while back, and it just came.</i>

644
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:00,740
I know the math
is too advanced for you.
It is for me too.

645
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:03,870
There's calculus,
differential equations...
No, I'll learn the math.

646
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:07,210
This is great, Miss Riley.
I'll learn everything.

647
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,210
It's the best present
that anyone's ever given me.

648
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:14,050
Thank you.
I'm gonna show the guys.

649
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,850
Well, Quentin
will probably go cra...
Goodness gracious, Hickam.

650
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,120
Watch where you're goin'.
Just...

651
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,320
- Where'd you get this?
- I gave it to him.

652
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,600
Bye, Miss Riley.

653
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,400
Miss Riley, our job is to give
these kids an education,
not false hopes.

654
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:36,000
False hopes?

655
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:40,140
Do you want me to sit quiet,
let 'em breathe in coal dust
the rest of their life?

656
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:43,410
Miss Riley, once in a while,

657
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,250
a lucky one will get out
on a football scholarship.

658
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,580
The rest of'em
work in the mines.

659
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,750
How about I believe
in the unlucky ones, hmm?

660
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:56,160
I have to, Mr. Turner,
or I'd go out of my mind.

661
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:04,360
<i>It's good, it's good.
Hey, Homer.</i>

662
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,930
Happy birthday, son.

663
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:08,940
Got some good news
for you, Homer.

664
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:12,340
Say hello to Fred Smith from
the University of West Virginia.

665
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:14,510
Hello, Homer.
Hi, sir.

666
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:18,540
Mr. Smith wants Jim to play
football there. He's offerin'
him a full scholarship.

667
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,550
Well, congratulations, Jim.

668
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,850
Do you play ball, son?

669
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,690
No, Homer shoots off rockets.
Whoosh and all that st...

670
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,690
Well, rockets
are not exactly my field, son,

671
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,200
<i>but maybe if you work hard,
you'll go to college too.</i>

672
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,960
<i>Yeah, on a science fiction
scholarship, maybe.
Jim.</i>

673
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,770
<i>Dear Dr. Von Braun,</i>

674
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:50,370
<i>thank you
for the autographed picture.</i>

675
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:52,880
<i>It will only further inspire me
to keep working...</i>

676
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:56,320
<i>toward our all-important goal
of entering that science fair
this spring.</i>

677
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,780
We're shootin' off
a rocket today.

678
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:29,020
I th-thought you'd like
to come see it.

679
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:31,960
I gotta catch up
on some work.

680
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:38,060
Ho-How come,
how come you never have work
when Jim plays football?

681
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:40,070
<i>You never miss a game.</i>

682
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:47,700
What time
are you gonna do it?

683
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:50,740
About 4:00.

684
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:56,510
Uh, I can't promise you...

685
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:59,640
Somebody pulled a pillar
too close.

686
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,890
Yeah?

687
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:09,950
Well, thank God for that.
Yeah, right now.

688
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:14,700
Nobody hurt.

689
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:24,610
# Go, Rocket Boys ##

You got it?
Can you see?

695
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:56,430
<i>Uh, no. Yes.
See it?</i>

696
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:59,640
Yeah, I see it.
What's the time?

697
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:02,770
Looks like 12 seconds.
Which one of you fellas
is Homer Hickam?

698
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:06,410
Um, it's me, sir.
I'm Basil Thorpe
with the Bluefield Telegraph.

699
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,050
Can I ask you
a few questions?

700
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,060
Sure.

701
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:16,290
<i>"The silvery cylinder

706
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,600
Hi, Homer.

707
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,740
Hi, Dorothy.
Would you please sign
my newspaper?

708
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,110
Sure.

709
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,710
I just know you're gonna be
really famous someday.

Excuse me. Excuse me.

What in the worid
is goin' on?

714
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,330
Miss Riley,
this does not concern you.

715
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:05,670
<i>You have these boys
in handcuffs.</i>

716
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:10,110
You have these boys
in handcuffs in a high school,
Mr. Turner.

717
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:13,310
You probably heard
about the forest fire last week
over by Welch.

718
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:17,020
A lot of timber went up.
Mr. Turner, you take
these handcuffs off these boys.

719
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:19,680
They found a rocket
on the side of the road.

720
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,020
We knew it started the fire,
ma'am. What we didn't know
is where it came from,

721
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,930
till this morning.

722
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,970
<i>Mr. Hickam, can you account
for all your rockets?</i>

723
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,970
No, sir. I can't.

724
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:45,870
If you weren't a minor,
you'd be in the state penitentiary.

725
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:48,650
I know, Dad. L...
Homer, I've been
confused by you,

726
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,050
I've been mad as hell
at you.

727
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,090
But, boy, it's the first time
in your life I've been ashamed
of you.

728
00:48:57,030 --> 00:49:01,160
You couldn't stop, man.
You couldn't!

729
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:04,140
Get in the car, Homer!

730
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,140
Homer, get in the car.

731
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:09,500
<i>Idiot! I ought
to goddamn kill ya.</i>

732
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:18,740
We ain't at the mine now.
This ain't your business.

733
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:21,220
You get in the car
with Homer, son.

734
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:25,020
You listen to me,
you drunken son of a bitch.

735

<i>If that boy's father was alive,
he'd kick your ass.</i>

So I'm gonna
have to do it for him.

737
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,290
If I see him with a bruise,
you get a scar.

738
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:37,170
If I see him with a limp,
you get crutches!

<i>You hear me?
Do you hear me?</i>

740
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:48,910
You know,
I'm reportin' you to the uni√≥n!

741
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,470
Screw you
and your damn uni√≥n.

742
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:12,340
Your father was
one of the best men
I ever had workin' for me.

743
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,410
I was lucky to know him.

744
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,530
Come on.

745
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:17,100

<i>#For I know
it will beat, beat, beat #</i>

750
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:50,570
<i># Tell me why #
They watched us get arrested.</i>

751
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,660
<i>We're practically ex-convicts.</i>

752
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,930
They'll never dance with us.

753
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:59,340
Jesus, Quentin.
You don't know anything
about women.

754
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:02,070
<i># Why do fools #</i>

755
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:05,880
<i>I heard she broke up
with that dumb jock.
#Fall in love ##</i>

756
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:11,120
See you later, hopeless.

757
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:17,460
<i>#Many a tear has to fall #</i>

758
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:24,470
<i>#But it's all in the game #</i>

759
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:32,780
<i>#All in the wonderful game #</i>

760
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:36,010
<i># That we know #</i>

761
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,710
<i>#As love #</i>

762
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,810
<i>Hi, Homer.</i>

763
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:42,820
Hi, Dorothy.

764
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:47,490
<i>- # You have words #
- Jim, look who's here.</i>

765
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:50,030
Yeah, ain't it past
your bedtime?

766
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,690
<i>#And your future's looking #
Let's go.</i>

767
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:55,290
<i>Hey, Jim.
#Dim #</i>

768
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,130
<i>#But these things #
Way to go.</i>

769
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:03,730
<i># Your hearts can rise #</i>

770
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:06,140
<i>#Above #</i>

771
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:13,450
<i># Once in a while
he will call ##</i>

772
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,390
<i># When the twilight is gone #</i>

773
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:29,490
<i>#Ah, ah #</i>

774
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:31,940
Hi, Valentine.

775
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,270
<i>#Ah #</i>

776
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:37,070
<i>I'm glad you didn't
go to jail.
# When the twilight is gone #</i>

777
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:40,240
<i>#Ah, ah #</i>

778
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:42,340
<i># You come into my heart #</i>

779
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,750
<i>#Ah #</i>

780
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:48,980
<i>#And here in my heart
you will stay #</i>

781
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:54,960
<i>It sure was exciting
watching your rockets
go up.</i>

782
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:05,600
<i>#My prayer #</i>

783
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:10,570
<i>#Is to linger with you #</i>

784
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:15,440
<i>#At the end of the day ##</i>

785
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:39,330
<i>You ever see that movie,
Frankenstein Meets
the Wolf Man?</i>

786
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,810
<i>Homer!</i>

787
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,510
Homer!
Down here!
Homer!

788
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:54,920
<i>Homer! Homer!
What is it?</i>

789
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:10,290
<i>Mom! Mom!</i>

790
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:13,770
Mom?

791
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:17,100
Your father always has to be
the big hero.

792
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:20,870
I swear to God,
if he gets killed,
I won't shed a tear.

793
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,230
It's comin' up!

794
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:11,560
<i>Who-Who is it?</i>

795
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:25,900
<i>It's Ike Bykovsky.
Bykovsky.</i>

796
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,420
<i>It's John Hickam!</i>

797
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:36,250
Dad, Dad!
The cable snapped.

798
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,290
May have fractured
his skull!

799
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:47,200
Get out of the way.
Move back, folks!
Let us through here!

800
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:54,040
Tell you what, Homer.
A dozen men would've died today
if it hadn't been for your dad.

801
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,550
Thank you, doctor.

802
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:44,560
Mm-hmm. Bye-Bye.

803
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:06,840
The, uh, doctor
says...

804
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:11,080
there's a chance your dad
could lose his eye.

805
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:15,710
<i>He has to go to the hospital
in Charleston,</i>

806
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:18,720
<i>and Olga won't pay
for all of it.</i>

807
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:23,390
I'm gonna go down to the mine
and ask Jake Mosby
to sign me on.

808
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:26,400
You can't do that, Jim.
You've got school.

809
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:30,130
Olga owns this house, Mom,
and half the furniture in it.

810
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:33,870
If you drop out,
you'll lose your scholarship.

811
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:38,810
- Homer, I'm the oldest.
It's my responsibility.
- I'll work in the mine.

812
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:18,020
Here you are,
Mr. Turner.
Thank you, Miss Wade.

813
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:25,620
Mining coal
is an honorable trade,
Mr. Hickam.

814
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:31,320
Nothing to be ashamed of.

815
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,210
Miss Riley!
Miss Riley!

816
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:18,500
Turn your light on, boy.

817
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,210
Remember when you
gave me these, John?

818
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:09,780
Carbon crystals
from the mine.

819
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:13,810
Yeah. Honeymoon.
At Myrtle Beach.

820
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:19,320
And you said,
"You always wanted diamonds.

821
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:23,200
But these are
the best I can do.
I wish they were real."

822
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:27,470
John, I never
wanted diamonds.

823
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:35,450
This whole year...

824
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:38,810
has been pretty rough going
down at the mine.

825
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:43,010
Bad tempers...

826
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:46,220
and a lot of strike talk.

827
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:50,730
An accident
makes things worse.

828
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,530
In a way, I guess,

829
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:58,730
I'm the one who's responsible
for what happened
to Mr. Bykovsky.

830
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:01,240
Listen to me, Homer.

831
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:05,310
Last month,

832
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:09,640
I gave Ike the chance
to go back to the machine shop,

833
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,650
<i>and he turned it down.</i>

834
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:15,050
<i>Yeah, he stayed in the mine
'cause the money was better.</i>

835
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:18,150
That was his decisi√≥n.

836
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:21,490
<i>You understand me?</i>

837
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,490
Yes, sir.

838
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:30,870
<i>Well, is mining coal as terrible
as you figured it'd be?</i>

839
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:33,370
<i>I guess not.</i>

840
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:37,600
But almost.

841
01:03:57,130 --> 01:04:01,620
Everybody says to say hi.
Michael and Billy.

842
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:03,900
Valentine Carmina.

843
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:05,900
How about Miss Riley?

844
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:10,910
She ain't been around much.
She got some new boyfriend
over in Welch.

845
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:15,640
So, uh, what's it like
down there?

846
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:21,650
You get used to it
after a while.

847
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:26,050
Besides, shoveling coal
has got its advantages.

848
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,650
Check this out.

849
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:32,630
Man, no wonder my stepdad
can slug me so good.

850
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:35,600
After a month down there,
you'd be able
to knock him out.

851
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,830
Well, I ain't
in no hurry.

852
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,180
See ya all later.
See ya, man.

853
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:55,190
See ya, Homer.

854
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,720
In Christ's name,
we pray. Amen.

855
01:04:59,790 --> 01:05:01,730
Amen.

856
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:09,420
We appreciate the sacrifice
you made here, Homer.

857
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:13,960
But pretty soon,
you'll be able to go back
and finish up the school year.

858
01:05:15,270 --> 01:05:17,300
I'm not going back
to school.

859
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,780
<i>A few weeks left in the term,</i>

860
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:22,180
I'll just stay put.

861
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:25,180
Well, I think you ought
to finish high school.

862
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:30,220
Well, tell him, John.

863
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:34,360
Homer's not a boy anymore.

864
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:39,530
<i>I don't think
I can tell him anything.</i>

865
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:56,240
<i>All I'm saying, John,
is the cutoff was not done
proper according to contract.</i>

866
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,250
Well, the company did
what it had to do.

867
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,790
Well, you know the uni√≥n
won't put up with it.

868
01:06:00,850 --> 01:06:05,020
Just give it a rest, Jake.
It's my first day back.

869
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:13,860
Hey, Lenny,
how's he doing?

870
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:15,920
<i>He's a chip
off the old block, John.</i>

871
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,030
It's good
to have you back.
Thank you.

872
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:27,970
Hi.
I'm headed toward the face.
You wanna come along?

873
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:34,880
<i>Even though I don't have
that piece of paper...</i>

874
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:38,250
<i>the thing from college...
they listen to me.</i>

875
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:40,260
You know why?

876
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:43,260
'Cause you know more
than they do.

877
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:46,560
You bet your life
I do. Homer.

878
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:50,400
I know the mine
like I know a man.

879
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:54,240
Heck, I can take
one look around here...

880
01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:58,370
Are you all right?

881
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,740
Yeah, I'm not afraid
of a little coal dust.

882
01:07:00,810 --> 01:07:03,800
Hell, Homer,
I was born for this.

883
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:07,750
I guess
it shouldn't surprise me
that you were too.

884
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:10,410
Let's go watch 'em
shoot some coal.

885
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:22,200
Elsie, hold dinner
for a while, will you?

886
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:24,700
I have to make a call.

887
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:32,040
Homer,

888
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:37,810
I was in the store today,
and I heard some talk.

889
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,960
<i>Boy, it's sure hard
to keep a secret in this town,
isn't it?</i>

890
01:07:54,030 --> 01:07:57,020
But I guess I did
a pretty good job.

891
01:07:57,100 --> 01:08:02,010
You know, there's a rumor going
around that I been sneaking off
to Welch to see some beau.

892
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:05,010
I wish that rumor'd
been true.
Yeah.

893
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:10,340
They told me Hodgkin's
can go into remissi√≥n,
so I might have some time.

894
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:12,980
Is there anything I can do,
Miss Riley?

895
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:16,350
You can accept
my apology.

896
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:19,150
For what?

897
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:21,620
My life's work
is teaching.

898
01:08:21,690 --> 01:08:25,190
And I believed
that if you boys won
that science fair,

899
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:30,170
got scholarships, went off
and did something great
with your lives,

900
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:33,030
somehow my life
would have counted
for something.

901
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:37,040
Homer.

902
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,210
You know what?

903
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:47,180
Sometimes you really
can't listen to what
anybody else says.

904
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:50,240
You just gotta
listen inside.

905
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:53,350
You're not supposed to
end up in those mines.

906
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:56,880
You know why?
'Cause I think
you made other plans.

907
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:00,400
I want you
to know something.

908
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:04,730
I'm proud of you.
I am.

909
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,700
Whatever you choose.

910
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:53,500
Excuse me, ma'am,
is Quentin home?

911
01:10:58,350 --> 01:10:59,870
Quentin.

912
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:08,720
Homer, y-you figured
this equation out
by yourself?

913
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:12,490
Well, if I did the math right.
It proves that you can't...

914
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,530
<i>l- It proves we didn't
start that fire!
Quentin, what're you doin'?</i>

915
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,090
<i>Now, the AUKXIII was
the only one that we couldn't
find that day.</i>

916
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:21,760
<i>And our best guess
for fall time
with the AUKXII,</i>

917
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,900
which is exactly identical,
was about 14 seconds.

918
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:27,340
If you help me
with the trig part,
Quentin,

919
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:31,080
we should be able
to make a good guess
where that rocket landed.

920
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:47,360
Six thousand,
three hundred
and twenty-eight feet.

921
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:51,200
One point two miles.

922
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:54,470
Homer?
Yeah?

923
01:11:57,110 --> 01:12:01,770
Are you gonna tell
Roy Lee and O'Dell
where I live?

924
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:06,780
It wouldn't matter
if you lived
in the governor's mansi√≥n,

925
01:12:06,850 --> 01:12:10,480
they'd still think
you're weird.

926
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:17,760
I'll see you at dawn.

927
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:20,590
Don't you have to go
to the mine?

928
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:23,100
I don't work there
anymore.

929
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:40,550
One.

930
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:49,360
<i>Two.</i>

931
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,740
Ninety-nine.

932
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:06,540
A hundred seven.

933
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:28,330
One hundred
and twenty-six.

934
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:32,270
That's 6,300 feet.

935
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:34,670
It's gotta be
around here somewhere.

936
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,500
What'd we do wrong?

937
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:05,370
I don't know.
L- I'll check the math again.

938
01:14:15,210 --> 01:14:17,340
Was there a wind
that day?

939
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:19,750
L- I don't remember.

940
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:21,980
<i>'Cause if there was,</i>

941
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:24,680
the wind probably came
from the west...

942
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,320
which means that
it would've pushed
the rocket...

943
01:14:29,490 --> 01:14:31,430
right there.

944
01:14:35,670 --> 01:14:38,000
Prodigious.

945
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:40,940
...associated...

946
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:50,040
Mr. Hayes,
where you off to
in such a hurry?

947
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:52,880
Okay, everybody,
back in your seats.

948
01:14:52,950 --> 01:14:57,410
Miss Stanton, Miss Blue,
let's go, back in your seats.
Mr. Hancock.

949
01:14:58,490 --> 01:15:00,580
That goes for you too,
Mr. Wilson.

950
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:07,060
Miss Riley,
what's going on in here?

951
01:15:07,130 --> 01:15:10,860
They didn't start
that fire, Mr. Turner.

952
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:13,700
In the first place,
you are not a member
of this classroom.

953
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:15,800
Neither are you,
Mr. Turner.

954
01:15:15,870 --> 01:15:17,810
Why don't you let the boy
defend himself?

955
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:21,940
And in the second place,
this rocket proves nothing.

956
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:24,810
<i>You've already admitted
having lost a number
of your rockets.</i>

957
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,940
You cannot prove
conclusively...

958
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:30,480
that another one of them
didn't start that fire.
Yes, I can.

959
01:15:37,460 --> 01:15:40,060
Are we to conclude,
Mr. Hickam, that
since leaving school,

960
01:15:40,130 --> 01:15:43,400
<i>you've not only become an expert
in rocket science, but in
the field of trigonometry?</i>

961
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:45,400
<i>I didn't say
that I was a rock...
Obviously, you learned more...</i>

962
01:15:45,470 --> 01:15:48,230
in the coal mines
than you did in high school.

963
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:52,800
Let the boy talk.
Go ahead, Homer.

964
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,900
Now, that fire was near Welch,
just under three miles
from our launchpad.

965
01:15:56,980 --> 01:16:01,610
And at the time of the fire,
the best that we could do
was 1.2 miles...

966
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:04,310
which is exactly where we found
that rocket, Mr. Turner.

967
01:16:04,390 --> 01:16:08,620
<i>See, Mr. Turner, that rocket
fell for about 14 seconds,
which means...</i>

968
01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:11,360
that it flew to an altitude
of 3,000 feet...

969
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:13,990
<i>according to the equation...</i>

970
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:17,470
"S" equals one-half"A"
"T" squared...

971
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:21,100
<i>where "S"is the altitude,
"A"is the gravity constant...
or 32...</i>

972
01:16:21,170 --> 01:16:23,800
and "T" is the time
it took for that rocket
to come back down.

973
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:26,870
<i>Velocity equals
acceleration times time.
Get him, Homer, get him.</i>

974
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:29,210
Are you following this,
Mr. Turner?

975
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:32,370
All right,
we're all duly impressed.

976
01:16:32,450 --> 01:16:36,510
But do you mind telling me,
if you did not start that fire,
who did?

977
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,820
What is it?

978
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:45,230
Whatever it is,
i- it's ingenious.
The fins are spring-loaded.

979
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:47,530
That isn't a rocket
at all.

980
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,030
It's an aeronautical flare.

981
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:56,200
There's an airport here
in Welch. It's right above
where the fire started.

982
01:17:05,550 --> 01:17:09,380
Mr. Hickam,
report to my office as soon
as we return to school.

983
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:13,580
<i>You do intend to enter
the county science fair,
do you not?</i>

984
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:15,820
Yes, sir, we do.

985
01:17:15,890 --> 01:17:18,520
Well, if you intend
to represent Big Creek,

986
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,530
you're gonna have to be
enrolled as a student
at Big Creek.

987
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:27,000
"Prodigenous."

988
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:32,040
<i>Do you think
you can draw well enough
so Mr. Bolden could build it?</i>

989
01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:34,040
<i>Yep.
Let me see.</i>

990
01:17:34,110 --> 01:17:36,770
Yeah.
Hey, Homer.

991
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:40,010
- Hi, Dad.
- What's this stuff doin' here?

992
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:43,380
<i>Mr. Hickam, we didn't
start the fire.
The troopers gave it back to us.</i>

993
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:45,750
Yeah, it wasn't even
one of our rockets.
It was an aeronautical flare.

994
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:47,880
Y'all go on home now.

995
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:49,890
Yes, sir.

996
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:11,040
This the reason
you skipped work today?
Yes, sir.

997
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:18,450
I thought you put
all this nonsense
behind you, Homer.

998
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:21,150
I thought you weren't
gonna be doin' it...
Dad, it isn't nonsense.

999
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:23,590
L- I don't wanna
argue with you.

1000
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:26,030
Look, son,

1001
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:29,730
I can't even begin to tell you
how proud of you I've been
these past weeks.

1002
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:34,600
I mean, you've just been
doin' a hell of a job
in that mine.

1003
01:18:34,670 --> 01:18:37,510
You keep goin',
you're gonna have
my job someday.

1004
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:40,740
Everybody says so.

1005
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:44,950
You got any idea how proud
that would make me?

1006
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:48,240
Dad, what l...

1007
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:53,990
I guess what I'm sayin' is,
is that if this rocket stuff
is so important to you,

1008
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:57,930
<i>then so be it,
as long as you're careful.</i>

1009
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,690
Guess there's worse hobbies
you could have.

1010
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:04,600
<i>But skippin'work,
that's out ofline.</i>

1011
01:19:04,670 --> 01:19:07,400
And you gotta know that.

1012
01:19:07,470 --> 01:19:11,170
So let's go
and get you right
with Jake.

1013
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:14,040
Tell him you'll work
the hoot owl shift tonight.

1014
01:19:14,110 --> 01:19:15,480
No.

1015
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:23,180
The coal mine's your life.
It's not mine.

1016
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:31,790
I'm never going
down there again.

1017
01:19:37,870 --> 01:19:40,300
I wanna go into space.

1018
01:20:03,630 --> 01:20:07,590
<i>Homer Hickam, Roy Lee Cook,
Quentin Wilson...</i>

1019
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:09,900
<i>and Sherman O'Dell
of Big Creek High...</i>

1020
01:20:09,970 --> 01:20:12,830
for their ingenious display
of amateur rocket-building
techniques.

1021
01:20:32,990 --> 01:20:35,460
I can't believe
we beat the kid
with the robot dog.

1022
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:39,190
And I thought
the see-through ear
was gonna win.

1023
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:41,750
I got Miss Wade workin'
on your travel arrangements,

1024
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:45,770
so you boys are gonna
have to decide who's goin'
to Indianapolis.

1025
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:48,530
We're all goin'.
Yeah.

1026
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:52,470
<i>Son, I wish you could,
but we can't afford
to send all four of you.</i>

1027
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:56,600
<i>Only one. Let me know
what you decide. I'm gonna
have to know by Friday.</i>

1028
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:59,670
You boys did
a fine job today.

1029
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:13,990
I need to borrow a suitcase,
and I'm gonna need
you guys' addresses...

1030
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:17,430
because I'm gonna
write some postcards.
Oh, you shut up, Roy Lee.

1031
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:20,490
Come on, you dope.
You know, you're goin',
Homer.

1032
01:21:20,570 --> 01:21:22,510
<i>Yeah.
Yeah.</i>

1033
01:21:22,570 --> 01:21:25,740
Say hello
to the outside worid
for us.

1034
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:28,110
Do we know
what we want?
Yeah!

1035
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:29,940
Are we gettin' it?
No!

1036
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:33,880
All right!
All in favor of goin' out
on strike, say "aye"!

1037
01:21:33,950 --> 01:21:35,380
Aye!

1038
01:21:35,450 --> 01:21:37,790
<i>All right, let's go!</i>

1039
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:40,690
<i>All right, shut 'em down!
Let's go!</i>

1040
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:44,960
<i>Strike! Strike!
Strike!</i>

1041
01:22:02,510 --> 01:22:04,640
Well, they sure are
gettin' themselves
worked up.

1042
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,650
Everybody's sayin'
this one's gonna be
a long one.

1043
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,740
And it will,
if I have anything
to say about it.

1044
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:11,790
Ungrateful
sons of bitches.

1045
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:15,660
Mom, have you seen
the big green suitcase?
Did you look in the attic?

1046
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:19,890
Yes, ma'am.
Well, I don't know. John,
you know where the suitcase is?

1047
01:22:22,130 --> 01:22:25,730
How the hell should I know
where the suitcase is?

1048
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,830
<i>I don't know, sug.</i>

1049
01:22:42,450 --> 01:22:46,150
- John!
- Y'all stay inside!

1050
01:22:48,230 --> 01:22:52,590
Vernon!

1051
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:54,760
<i>I'm gonna kill
that son of a bitch!</i>

1052
01:22:54,830 --> 01:22:56,860
Oh, don't be
a damn fool.

1053
01:22:56,930 --> 01:23:01,700
All right, well,
what are we gonna do?
Nothin'.

1054
01:23:01,770 --> 01:23:05,440
<i>Drunken bastard couldn't hit
the broad side of a barn.</i>

1055
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:07,670
He tried to kill you, Dad.
Yeah, Dad,
you can't just stand...

1056
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:10,540
Hey, hey, don't
trouble yourself, Homer.

1057
01:23:10,610 --> 01:23:13,110
You got
more important things
to worry about.

1058
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:16,950
<i>Just go look
for your suitcase.</i>

1059
01:23:20,790 --> 01:23:23,780
Forget about it, Homer.

1060
01:23:23,860 --> 01:23:25,800
Shut up, Jim!

1061
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:30,930
Listen, I'm sorry about
what's goin' on around here,
but it isn't my fault!

1062
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,990
What do you want
from me anyway?
Better watch yourself, Homer!

1063
01:23:34,070 --> 01:23:36,560
If I win at Indianapolis,
maybe I can go to college,

1064
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:38,700
maybe even get a job
at Cape Canaveral!

1065
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:41,970
<i>There's nothing here for me!
The town is dyin'!</i>

1066
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:44,310
The mine is dyin'!
Everybody knows it here
but you!

1067
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:47,780
You wanna get out of here
so bad, then go! Go!

1068
01:23:47,850 --> 01:23:49,150
Yeah, I'll go!
Yeah, I'll go!

1069
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:50,550
Go, go!
I'll go!

1070
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:55,820
And I'll be gone forever!
I won't even look back!

1071
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,470
<i>Welcome to Indianapolis!</i>

1072
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:44,570
<i>Visitors to the fair
will include prominent members
of every branch...</i>

1073
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:46,910

1074
01:24:46,980 --> 01:24:49,280
<i>The fair will be open

1075

<i>The following day,
the judges will arrive
to select the winners.</i>

1076
01:24:54,390 --> 01:24:59,480
By timing the rocket's descent,
we would be able to figure out
just how high the rocket flew.

1077
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:05,160
Would you like to see?
This is a Delaval nozzle.

1078
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:07,390
Do any of y'all know
what a Delaval noz...

1079
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:20,880
Two, please.
The judges always go
for the most expensive exhibits.

1080
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:22,880
That guy with
the biosphere's gonna win.

1081
01:25:22,950 --> 01:25:26,820
I don't think so.
My money's on the kid
with the rocket display.

1082
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:29,820
Have you seen it yet?
It's really cool.

1083

<i>Mr. Owens,
to the security office.</i>

1084

<i>Mr. Owens,
to the security office, please.</i>

1085
01:25:49,070 --> 01:25:52,570
<i>It's not like we got a hell
of a lot of time, Roy Lee.
The judging is tomorrow.</i>

1086
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:54,580
There's nothin' we can do
without Mr. Bolden.

1087
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:56,940
And he can't get anywhere
near the machine shop.

1088
01:25:57,010 --> 01:26:00,920
They even took my picture
of Dr. Von Braun.

1089
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:02,920
They stole everything.

1090
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:14,620
Leon, what are you doing
back here?

1091
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:16,860
You know you shouldn't
be seen back here.

1092
01:26:16,930 --> 01:26:19,200
I know, Elsie,
but Homer's in trouble.

1093
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:38,490
Elsie, I don't have the power
to settle this strike.

1094
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:41,490
The bosses listen to you.
They'll do what you tell 'em.

1095
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:44,120
I am not gonna crawl
on my belly...

1096
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:47,760
in front of those
miserable uni√≥n rats.

1097
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:50,560
Is that what this
is about, John?
Is this about your pride?

1098
01:26:50,630 --> 01:26:53,100
No, it's about what's best
for Coalwood.

1099
01:26:53,170 --> 01:26:58,230
If this mine
doesn't produce,
then the town dies.

1100
01:26:58,310 --> 01:27:02,140
Think the uni√≥n gives
a good damn about that?

1101
01:27:02,210 --> 01:27:04,770
They're nothin'
but a bunch of greedy
sons of bitches that...

1102
01:27:04,850 --> 01:27:06,780
Shut up, John.
Just shut up.

1103
01:27:06,850 --> 01:27:10,010
Homer once said
you love the mine more
than your own family.

1104
01:27:10,090 --> 01:27:12,520
And I took up for you
'cause I didn't wanna
believe it.

1105
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:15,580
Homer has gotten a lot of help
from the people in this town.

1106
01:27:15,660 --> 01:27:18,750
They've helped him build
his rockets, they've gone out
there and watched him fly 'em.

1107
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:23,130
But not you, John.
You never showed up.
Not even once.

1108
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:25,260
Now, I'm not asking you
to believe in him,

1109
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:28,030
but he's your son,
for God's sake, John.

1110
01:27:28,110 --> 01:27:31,200
And I am askin' you
to help him.

1111
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:33,210
If you don't,
I'll leave you.

1112
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:36,140
I'll find work.
I'll do whatever it takes
to get away from here.

1113
01:27:36,210 --> 01:27:41,520
I'll live in a tree
to get away from you.
Don't you think I won't.

1114
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:45,190
Where would you go?

1115
01:27:47,660 --> 01:27:49,590
Myrtle Beach.

1116
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:06,210
I guess we all know
this isn't gonna fix things,

1117
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:08,710
uh, at least not for long.

1118
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:11,340
We know you did
what you could for us.

1119
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:13,540
Jake.
Thanks.

1120
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:15,520
Leon.

1121
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:17,520
Yes, John.

1122
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:22,720
Don't you have
some work to do?

1123
01:28:35,170 --> 01:28:38,040
It's packed and shipped
and on its way. Be at
the bus station, 8:00 a.m.

1124
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:40,870
Okay, Mom,
but how'd you...
Your father, Homer.

1125
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:43,170
It was your father.
Give 'em hell, Homer!

1126
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:51,140
- Good luck, sweetie.
- Bye.

1127
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:06,370
Thanks, Dad.

1128
01:29:19,650 --> 01:29:22,640
<i>When
the rocket propellant burns,
it produces a river of gas...</i>

1129
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:25,210
<i>which flows through
the convergent section
of the nozzle.</i>

1130
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:27,550
If the river continues
through the nozzle,

1131
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:29,620
but through the throat
at less than sonic speed...

1132
01:29:29,690 --> 01:29:32,220
that is to say, less than
the speed of sound...

1133
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:35,630
it becomes compact in the...
compacted in the divergent
section,

1134
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:37,630
bound in turmoil
and inefficient.

We got the best science program
in the state, buddy, okay?

01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:05,310
Congratulations, son.
Good luck to you.

1145

What did he say to you?
What did who say?

01:31:10,660 --> 01:31:16,400
Von Braun.
That was Wernher von Braun.
You just shook his hand.

01:31:33,580 --> 01:31:36,780
Oh, Homer,
I'm so proud of you.
Thanks, Mom.

He's not here, hon.

Oh!
You did it!

1154
01:32:13,890 --> 01:32:16,990
I knew you would.

1155

1156
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:23,760
We all got scholarships.

01:32:27,740 --> 01:32:31,470
From now on,
every school year,

1159
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:33,980
I'm gonna brag
to all my new students...

1160
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:37,670
about how I taught
Homer Hickam
and the Rocket Boys.

1161

Maybe one day,

one of them'll feel
like they can do
what y'all did.

1163
01:32:56,230 --> 01:32:59,170
You know, just,
stuff like that
takes time.

1164
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:06,710
Will you let me out?

01:33:13,550 --> 01:33:18,320
<i>What are they doin',

01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:21,020
Hell, I'm going to salvage
something up here?

1167
01:33:21,090 --> 01:33:23,120
Hey, Dad. Hi.
Hello, Homer.

1168
01:33:23,190 --> 01:33:26,820
I just wanted to tell you
how much I appreciate
what you did for me.

1169
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:30,890
I know it wasn't easy for you,
so thank you.

1170
01:33:30,970 --> 01:33:33,660
A- And we're shootin' off
our last rocket today at 5:00,

1171
01:33:33,740 --> 01:33:37,260
so if you'd like to come
see it...
I got a lot of work to do.

1172
01:33:37,340 --> 01:33:40,670
All right. Well,
I just thought I'd ask.

1173
01:33:43,410 --> 01:33:45,810
Hear you met
your big hero.

1174
01:33:48,150 --> 01:33:50,350
Didn't even know it.

1175
01:33:57,090 --> 01:33:59,030
Look,

1176
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:02,030
I know you and me
don't exactly see eye to eye
on certain things.

1177
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:06,700
I mean,
we don't see eye to eye
on just about anything.

1178
01:34:06,770 --> 01:34:11,470
But Dad, I come to believe
that I got it in me to be
somebody in this worid.

1179
01:34:11,540 --> 01:34:14,370
A- And it's not because
I'm so different
from you either.

1180
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:16,840
It's 'cause
I'm the same.

1181
01:34:16,910 --> 01:34:21,610
You know, I can be
just as hardheaded
and just as tough.

1182
01:34:21,690 --> 01:34:25,920
I only hope I can be
as good a man as you are.

1183
01:34:25,990 --> 01:34:29,050
I mean, sure,

1184
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:32,650
Dr. Von Braun's
a great scientist,

1185
01:34:32,730 --> 01:34:35,160
but he isn't my hero.

1186
01:35:36,830 --> 01:35:41,290
It's our last rocket.
Yeah, let's do it.

1187
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:44,300
Wire it up for me, will ya?
I gotta do something.
Yeah.

01:35:48,470 --> 01:35:51,340
Congratulations
on winning
the science fair.

1190
01:35:51,410 --> 01:35:54,670
It's gotta be the most
exciting thing that's ever
happened around here.

1191
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:57,980
Um, I was thinking,
Homer, if, if you've
got some time...

1192
01:35:58,050 --> 01:36:01,780
Excuse me, Dorothy.
Hi.
Hi.

1193
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:09,390
Good luck.
Thanks.

1194
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:11,950
Hey, everybody, can we have
your attention, please?

1195
01:36:12,030 --> 01:36:14,020
Come on, Homer,
let her fly!

1196
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:17,730
We're gonna launch the rocket
in a minute, but we'd like
to say thank you first.

1197
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:22,200
If it wasn't for y'all,
we'd never have gotten
into any science fair.

1198
01:36:22,270 --> 01:36:25,140
We'd probably never have
gotten past blowin' up
my mom's fence.

1199
01:36:25,210 --> 01:36:27,570
But we did...

1200
01:36:27,640 --> 01:36:31,210
because of your help
and support.

1201
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:33,720
And this is for Coalwood.

1202
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:42,490
There are a few people
who believed in us
even before we did.

1203
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:46,150
We'd like to dedicate
this rocket to them.

1204
01:36:46,230 --> 01:36:48,750
To Ike Bykovsky.

1205
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:54,730
To Mr. Bolden,
who helped us so much.

1206
01:36:57,340 --> 01:37:00,330
To the person
who first inspired us,

1207
01:37:00,410 --> 01:37:02,840
our teacher, Miss Riley.

1208
01:37:04,950 --> 01:37:10,180
And, finally, I'd like
to dedicate this rocket
to my mom and to...

1209
01:37:15,330 --> 01:37:17,260
my dad.

1210
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:36,100
You know, it, uh, won't fly
unless somebody pushes
the button.

1211
01:37:39,350 --> 01:37:41,480
It's yours,
if you want it.

1212
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:07,800
Ten, nine...
Eight,

1213
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:10,470
<i>seven, six, five,</i>

1214
01:38:10,550 --> 01:38:14,280
four, three, two, one.

1215
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:34,830
Look at it go, Homer.
This one's gonna go for miles.

1216
01:44:46,140 --> 01:44:50,410
