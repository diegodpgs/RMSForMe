1
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,995
Why not call it
the Big Chill or the Nippy era?

2
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,992
I'm just sayin',
how do we know it's an Ice age?

3
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,674
Because of all the ice.

4
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,429
Well, things just got a little chillier.

5
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,956
Help. Help.

6
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,237
Come on, kids, let's go. The traffic's movin'.

7
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,516
But, but, but, Dad.

8
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,279
No buts. You can play extinction later.

9
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,876
OK. Come on, guys.

10
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,111
So, where's Eddie?

11
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,829
He said he was on the verge
of an evolutionary breakthrough.

12
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,911
Really?

13
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,960
I'm flying.

14
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,270
Some breakthrough.

15
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,794
- Look out.
- You're going the wrong way.

16
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,751
Crazy mammoth.

17
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,796
Do the world a favour.
Move your issues off the road.

18
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,233
If my trunk was that small,
I wouldn't draw attention to myself, pal.

19
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,870
Give me a break.
We've been waddlin' all day.

20
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,239
Go ahead. Follow the crowd.

21
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,470
It'll be quieter when you're gone.

22
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,439
Come on. If he wants to
freeze to death, let him.

23
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,071
I'm up. I'm up.

24
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,520
Rise and shine, everybody.
Huh? Zak? Marshall?

25
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,239
Bertie? Uncle Fungus?

26
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,790
Where is everybody? Come on, guys,
we're gonna miss the migration.

27
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,472
They left without me.
They do this every year.

28
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,278
Why? Doesn't anyone love me?

29
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,838
Isn't there anyone who cares
about Sid the Sloth?

30
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,470
All right, I'll just go by myself.

31
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,552
Sick.

32
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,279
Wide body, kerb it next time.

33
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,749
Oh, jeez. Yuck.

34
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,393
I can't believe it. Fresh wild greens.
Frank, where did you ever...?

35
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,517
- Go ahead. Dig in.
- A dandelion.

36
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,036
- I thought the frost wiped 'em all out.
- All but one.

37
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,075
It makes me so... I wanna... Yuck.

38
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,711
This has definitely not been my day.
You know what I'm sayin', buddy?

39
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,429
What a mess. You rhinos
have tiny brains. Did you know that?

40
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,310
It's just a fact. No offence. You probably
didn't even know what I'm talkin' about.

41
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,353
Yummo.

42
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,393
A dandelion. Must be
the last one of the season.

43
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,635
- Carl.
- Easy, Frank.

44
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,711
He ruined our salad.

45
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,713
My mistake. That was my mistake. Let me...

46
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,915
No, no, seriously, let me
take care of this. What is this?

47
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,515
Pine cones. Oh, my goodness.
They're my favourite.

48
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,632
Delicious. That's good eating.

49
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,111
But don't let me hog them all up.
Here, you have some.

50
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,873
<i>Tasty, isn't it? Bon appêtit.</i>

51
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,230
Now?

52
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,671
Now.

53
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,079
- Just pretend that I'm not here.
- I wanted to hit him at full speed.

54
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,234
- That's OK. We'll have some fun with him.
- Don't let them impale me. I wanna live.

55
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,517
- Get off me.
- Come on, you're makin' a scene.

56
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,273
<i>We'll just take our furry piñata and go.</i>

57
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,238
If it's not them today,
it's someone else tomorrow.

58
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,629
Well, I'd rather it not be today. OK?

59
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,951
We'll break your neck
so you don't feel a thing.

60
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,032
Wait a minute. I thought
rhinos were vegetarians.

61
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,151
- An excellent point.
- Shut up.

62
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,755
Who says we're gonna eat him
after we kill him?

63
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,638
I don't like animals that kill for pleasure.

64
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,996
- Save it for a mammal that cares.
- I'm a mammal that cares.

65
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,155
OK, if either of you make it across that
sinkhole in front of ya, you get the sloth.

66
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,949
That's right, you losers.
You take one step and you're dead.

67
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,436
- You were bluffing, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, that was a bluff.

68
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,232
Get him.

69
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,791
A dandelion?

70
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,511
We did it.

71
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,269
- You have beautiful eyes.
- Get off my face.

72
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,353
Whoa, we make a great team.
What do you say we head south together?

73
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,829
Great. Jump on my back
and relax the whole way.

74
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,876
- Wow, really?
- No.

75
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,272
Wait, aren't you going south?
The change of seasons, migration instincts.

76
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,999
- Any of this a-ringin' a bell?
- I guess not. Bye.

77
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,878
OK, then. Thanks for the help.
I can take it from here.

78
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,429
You overgrown weasel.
Wait till we get down there.

79
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,789
That south thing is way overrated.
The heat, the crowds - who needs it?

80
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,271
Isn't this great? You and me,
two bachelors knockin' about in the wild.

81
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,035
No, you just want a bodyguard
so you don't become somebody's side dish.

82
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,350
You're a very shrewd mammal.

83
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,273
OK, lead the way, Mr Big...
Didn't get the name.

84
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,316
- Manfred.
- Manfred? Yuck.

85
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,394
How about Manny the Moody Mammoth?
Or Manny the Melancholy... Manny the...

86
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,791
Stop following me.

87
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,997
OK, so you've got issues. You won't
even know I'm here. I'll just zip the lip.

88
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,028
Look at the cute little baby, Diego.

89
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,519
- Isn't it nice he'll be joining us for breaktast?
- It wouldn't be breaktast without him.

90
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,152
Especially since his daddy wiped out half
our pack and wears our skin to keep warm.

91
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,232
An eye for an eye, don't you think?

92
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,756
Let's show him what happens
when he messes with sabres.

93
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,877
Alert the troops. We attack at dawn.

94
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,317
And, Diego, bring me that baby alive.

95
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,474
If I'm gonna enjoy my revenge,
I want it to be fresh.

96
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,070
Phew. I'm wiped out.

97
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,910
- That's your shelter?
- You're a big guy. You got a lotta wood.

98
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,673
- I'm a little guy.
- You got half a stick.

99
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:10,869
But with my little stick and my highly
evolved brain, I shall create fire.

100
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,998
Fascinating.

101
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,233
We'll see if brains triumph
over brawn tonight. Now, won't we?

102
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,116
Think I saw a spark.

103
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,350
Any chance I could squeeze
in there with you, Manny, ol' pal?

104
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,874
Isn't there someone else you can annoy?

105
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,350
Friends? Family? Poisonous reptiles?

106
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,236
My family abandoned me.
They just kinda migrated without me.

107
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,834
You should see what they did last year.

108
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,559
They woke up early and
tied my hands and feet

109
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,313
and they gagged me with a fieldmouse,

110
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,870
covered their tracks, went
through water so I'd lose their scent,

111
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,679
and... who needs 'em, anyway?

112
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,270
So what about you? You have family?

113
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,357
OK, you're tired. I see.
We'll talk more in the morning.

114
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,190
Manfred? Manfred?
Could you scooch over a drop?

115
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,192
Come on. Nobody falls asleep that fast.

116
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,271
Manny.

117
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,190
There's Diego. Fall back.

118
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,233
- Where's the baby?
- I lost it over the falls.

119
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,874
You lost it?

120
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,108
- I want that baby, Diego.
- I'll get it.

121
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,715
You'd better, unless you want to
serve as a replacement.

122
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,031
We'll go up to Half Peak. Meet us there.

123
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,351
It had better be alive.

124
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,989
Can we trust you with that, Diego?

125
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,469
Let's go.

126
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,154
She picked a hair off my shoulder and says,
"If you have an extra mating dance,

127
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,708
at least pick a female
with the same colour pelt. "

128
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,156
I thought "Whoa. She's gonna go
praying mantis on me. "

129
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,835
If you find a mate, you should be loyal.
In your case, grateful.

130
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,071
- Now get away from me.
- I think mating for life is stupid.

131
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,310
There's plenty of Sid to go around.

132
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,796
Manny?

133
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,351
Manny?

134
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,434
Look at that. He's OK.

135
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,760
She's gone.

136
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,436
- Manny, are you forgetting something?
- No.

137
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,439
- But you just saved him.
- I'm trying to get rid of the last thing I saved.

138
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,909
But you can't leave him here.

139
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,150
Look, there's smoke.
That's his herd right up the hill.

140
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,188
- We should return him.
- Let's get this straight. There is no "we".

141
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,673
There never was a "we". In fact,
without me, there wouldn't even be a "you".

142
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:20,159
- Just up the hill.
- Listen very carefully: I'm not going.

143
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,110
- Fine, be ajerk. I'll take care of him.
- Yeah, that's good.

144
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,476
You can't even take care of yourself.
This, I gotta see.

145
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,678
I'll return you. We don't need
that meany-weeny mammoth, do we?

146
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,796
No, we don't.

147
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,276
You're an embarrassment to nature.
Do you know that?

148
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,957
This is cake. I'm fine, I'm fine.

149
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,031
I'm gonna die.

150
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,359
Manny.

151
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,314
- That pink thing is mine.
- No. Actually, that pink thing belongs to us.

152
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,516
"Us"? You two are a bit of an odd couple.

153
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,318
There is no "us".

154
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,597
I see. Can't have one of your own,
so you want to adopt.

155
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,672
Look, I'm sorry to interrupt
your snack, but we gotta go.

156
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,196
The baby? Please.
I was returning him to his herd.

157
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,271
Oh, yeah. Nice try, bucktooth.

158
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,351
- Callin' me a liar?
- I didn't say that.

159
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,431
You were thinkin' it.

160
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,080
I don't like this cat. He reads minds.

161
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,070
- Name's Diego, friend.
- Manfred, and I'm not your friend.

162
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:21,112
Fine, Manfred. If you're lookin' for the
humans, you're wastin' your time. They left.

163
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,237
Thanks for the advice. Now beat it.

164
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,199
I'll help you bring it to its herd,
but leave me alone after that.

165
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,716
- OK. OK, deal. What's your problem?
- You are my problem.

166
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,952
I think you're stressed, so you eat too much.
It's hard to get fat on a vegan diet.

167
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,999
I'm not fat. It's all this fur.
It makes me look poofy.

168
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,834
All right, you have fat hair.
But when you're ready to talk, I'm here.

169
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,071
What are you doin'? Just drop it on the ledge.

170
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,197
- We should make sure they found him.
- Good idea.

171
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,669
No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

172
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,796
Don't spear me.

173
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,713
- This is a problem.
- Now what?

174
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,188
That's perfect.

175
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,514
- I told you they were gone.
- Look who it is.

176
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,194
Don't you have some
poor animal to disembowel?

177
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,955
They couldn't be far. I mean,
they went this way, or this way?

178
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,315
You don't know much
about tracking, do you?

179
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,115
I'm a sloth. I see a tree,
eat a leaf. That's my tracking.

180
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,350
You didn't miss them by much.

181
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,716
It's still green.
They headed north two hours ago.

182
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,073
It's still green.
They headed north two hours ago.

183
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,880
You don't need this aggravation.

184
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,475
Give me the baby. I can
track humans down a lot faster than you.

185
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,154
And you're just a good citizen helpin' out?

186
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,630
- I just know where the humans are going.
- Glacier Pass.

187
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,156
Everybody knows they have
a settlement on the other side.

188
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,835
Unless you know how to track, you'll never
reach them before snow closes the pass.

189
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,872
Which should be, like, tomorrow.

190
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,557
So, you can give that baby to me,
or go get lost in a blizzard. It's your choice.

191
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,078
Here's your little bundle ofjoy.
We're returning it to the humans.

192
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:50,473
The big, bad tigey-wigey gets left behind.
Poor tigey-wigey.

193
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,279
Sid, tigey-wigey is gonna lead the way.

194
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,240
Manny, can I talk to you for a second?

195
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,950
No. The sooner we find the humans,
the sooner I get rid of Mr Stinky Drool-Face,

196
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,429
and the baby, too.

197
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,040
You won't always have
Jumbo around to protect you.

198
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:15,513
And when that day comes, I suggest you
watch your back, cos I'll be chewin' on it.

199
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,229
Über-tracker. Up front, where I can see you.

200
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,833
Help me.

201
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,469
You gotta make it stop.
I can't take it any more.

202
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,599
- I've eaten things that complained less.
- He won't stop squirming.

203
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,716
- Watch its head.
- Put it down.

204
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,268
Jeez, "pick him up, put him down... "

205
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,677
- Its nose is dry.
- That means something's wrong with it.

206
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,638
- Someone should lick it. Just in case.
- I'll do it.

207
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,075
- He's wearing one of those baby thingies.
- So?

208
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,833
So if he poops, where does it go?

209
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,954
- Humans are disgusting.
- OK, you. Check for poop.

210
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,157
- Why am I the poop-checker?
- Returning him was your idea,

211
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,550
you're small and insignificant,
and I'll pummel you if you don't.

212
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,029
- Why else?
- Now, Sid.

213
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,437
I mean, my goodness.
Look out. Coming through.

214
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,273
- Watch out.
- Stop wavin' that thing around.

215
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,999
I'm gonna slip.

216
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,475
It's clean. Got ya!

217
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,591
Will you cut it out?

218
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,113
Do that again. He likes it.

219
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,157
It's makin' me feel better too.

220
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,310
Here, you hold it.

221
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,272
Turn him towards me.

222
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,670
Where is the baby?

223
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,790
There he is.

224
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,599
Where is the baby?

225
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,152
There he is.

226
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,675
Stop it. You're scarin' him.

227
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,995
- I bet he's hungry.
- How about some milk?

228
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,992
- I'd love some.
- Not you. The baby.

229
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,594
I ain't exactly lactating right now, pal.

230
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,319
- You're a little low on the food chain to...
- Enough.

231
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,790
Enough, enough, enough.

232
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,191
Food.

233
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,678
I don't know, but I've been told

234
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,796
I don't know, but I've been told

235
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,876
End of the world be mighty cold

236
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,669
Prepare for the Ice age!

237
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,149
Protect the dodo way of life!

238
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,358
Survival separates the dodos from the beasts!

239
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,914
Protect the dodo way of life!

240
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,150
Prepare for the Ice age!

241
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,118
- Ice age?
- I've heard of these crackpots.

242
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,354
- Intruders.
- Now, don't fall in.

243
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,319
- If you do, you will definitely...
- Intruders. Intruder...

244
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,831
<i>.. burn and die.</i>

245
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,957
Can we have our melon back?
Junior's hungry and...

246
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,191
No way. This is our private
stockpile for the Ice age.

247
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,273
Subarctic temperatures will force us
underground for a billion years.

248
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,351
So you got three melons?

249
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,679
If you weren't smart enough
to plan ahead, then doom on you.

250
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,309
Doom on you. Doom on you. Doom on you.

251
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,073
- Get away from me.
- Doom on you.

252
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,355
Oh, no. No.

253
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,190
Retrieve the melon.
Tae kwon dodos, attack.

254
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,830
- The melon.
- The melon, the melon, the melon...

255
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,750
There goes our last female.

256
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,350
- Got it, got it, got it.
- Don't got it.

257
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,669
The last melon.

258
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,798
Sid. Now we gotta find more food.

259
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,834
Right, more to the right. Right, right, right.

260
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,435
- Look at that. Dinner and a show.
- Left, left, left.

261
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,999
Now to find a meal
befitting a conquering hero.

262
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,671
What ho? A foe? Come on,
come on. You want a piece of me?

263
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,151
Spoils worthy of such a noble...

264
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,911
Bedtime, squirt.

265
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,031
The triumphant return.

266
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,873
Huh? Oh, that.

267
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:54,118
I'm so full. How about a good-night
kiss for your big buddy, Sid?

268
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,798
- He's asleep.
- I was talking to you.

269
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,676
Fine, I'll tuck myself in.

270
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,752
All right, good night.

271
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,430
Will you stop it?

272
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,433
All right, all right. I was trying to relax.

273
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,871
Oy.

274
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,277
- What the...?
- Slice me. It'll be the last thing you ever do.

275
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,830
- I'm workin' here, you waste of fur.
- Frustrated, Diego?

276
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,832
Tracking down helpless infants
too difficult for you?

277
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,833
- What are you two doin' here?
- Soto's getting tired of waiting.

278
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:48,994
Yeah, he said "Come back with the baby,
or don't come back at all. "

279
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,710
I have a message for Soto.

280
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,189
Tell him I'm bringing the baby.

281
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,510
And tell him I'm bringing...

282
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,071
a mammoth.

283
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,720
- A mammoth?
- Mammoths never travel alone.

284
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,756
This one does,
and I'm leading him to Half Peak.

285
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,390
Look at all that meat. Let's get him.

286
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,553
Not yet. We'll need the whole pack
to bring this mammoth down.

287
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,631
Get everyone ready.

288
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,271
Now.

289
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,517
- Where's the baby?
- You lost it?

290
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,189
Sid.

291
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,589
It's so ugly. Positively adorable.

292
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:56,389
Hello, pumpkin. Hello, little baldy bean.

293
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,349
- Where'd you find it?
- The poor kid, all alone in the wild.

294
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,596
Sabres were closing in on him.

295
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,558
- So I just snatched him.
- So brave.

296
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:10,236
Yeah, well, he needed me,
and I only wish I had one of my own, too.

297
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,313
Really? I find that attractive in a male.

298
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,870
Alas. Who wouldn't want
a family, I always say.

299
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,989
- Where've you been hiding?
- Yeah, well, you know...

300
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,949
Cute kid, huh? So, as I was saying, ladies...

301
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,508
Hey. Hi, Manny.

302
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,349
What's the matter with you?

303
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,838
Excuse me, ladies. You just keep
marinating and I'll be right back.

304
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,151
Sexy.

305
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,792
He's not much to look at,
but it's so hard to find a family guy.

306
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,190
Tell me about it.
All the sensitive ones get eaten.

307
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,196
No, no, no. Manny, please,
I'm begging you. I need him.

308
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,716
- A good-lookin' guy like you?
- You say that, but you don't mean it.

309
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:04,112
No, seriously. Look at you.
Those ladies, they don't stand a chance.

310
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,556
- You have a cruel sense of humour.
- Don't let me cramp your style.

311
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,552
- Thanks, Manny. You're a pal.
- Without Pinky.

312
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,870
Manny, I need him.

313
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,232
So, ladies, where were we?

314
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,114
- Carl.
- Easy, Frank.

315
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:28,832
Pretty tail walks by, suddenly he moves
like a cheetah. And that tiger...

316
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,595
Yeah, Mr Great Tracker.
Can't even find a sloth.

317
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,389
What am I? The wet nurse?
What are you lookin' at, bone bag?

318
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,109
Look at you. You're gonna
grow into a great predator.

319
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,718
I don't think so. What have you got?
You got a little patch of fur.

320
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,234
No fangs, no claws.

321
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,551
You're folds of skin wrapped in mush.

322
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,514
What's so threatening about you?

323
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,318
Does this look like
a petting zoo to you? Huh?

324
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,550
OK. All right, wise guy.
You just earned a time-out.

325
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,233
You think that's funny? How about this?

326
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,953
You'll be a little snack for the owls.

327
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,637
You're a brave little squirt, I'll give you that.

328
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,917
Thank goodness. Thank goodness.
No. A tiger.

329
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,434
Help. Help.

330
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,630
- Where's the baby?
- Manfred has him.

331
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,759
Just put me in your mouth.
Come on. Hurry up. He got me.

332
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,669
Help.

333
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,228
- Get away from me.
- It went this way.

334
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,195
Over here.

335
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,994
Carl. The tiger beat us to him.

336
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,868
Wait a minute.

337
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,029
He's dead all right.

338
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,156
Carnivores have all the fun.

339
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:21,151
Gosh, I hate breaking their hearts
like that. But you know how it is.

340
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,514
All right, thanks. You can put me down now.

341
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,150
Manny. Manny.

342
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,274
Guys, I thought we were in a hurry.
And Diego, spit that out.

343
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,318
You don't know where it's been.

344
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,995
Boy. For a second there,
I thought you were gonna eat me.

345
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,072
- I don't eatjunk food.
- Thought you were gonna...

346
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,469
I thought you were gonna... Were you?

347
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,915
Come on, wait up. Wait up. Come on,
come on. Can you wait a second, please?

348
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,991
Fellas.

349
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,191
Thanks for waiting.

350
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,874
Three, two, one...

351
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,671
Sure is faithful.

352
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,990
- Don't make me reach back.
- He started it.

353
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,197
I don't care who started it. I'll finish it.

354
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,393
Modern architecture. It'll never last.

355
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,236
Hiya, Manny.

356
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,230
Hi, Diego.

357
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,831
Hey, Sid.

358
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,795
- You're lost.
- No. I know exactly where we are.

359
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,110
Ask him directions.

360
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,760
- I don't need directions.
- Fine, I'll ask him.

361
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,832
Buddy. You see any humans go by here?

362
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,718
I love this game. I love this game. OK, OK.

363
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:48,078
Three words. First word.
Stomp. No, no. Stamp, stamp.

364
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,230
Let me try. Pack.

365
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,393
Good one, Manny.
Pack of long teeth and claws.

366
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,836
Pack of wolves? Pack of...

367
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,514
Pack of bears? Pack of fleas?

368
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,591
Pack of whiskers? Pack of noses?

369
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,155
- Pachyderm?
- Pack of lies.

370
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,073
Pack of troubles. Pack a wallop.
Pack of birds.

371
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,311
Pack of flying fish.

372
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,875
Great news. I found a short cut.

373
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:06,559
- What do you mean, short cut?
- I mean faster than the long way around.

374
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,717
I know what a short cut is.

375
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,874
Either we beat the humans to Glacier Pass
or we take the long way and miss 'em.

376
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,550
Through there? What do you take me for?

377
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,950
This time tomorrow,
you could be a free mammoth.

378
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,920
Or a nanny. I never get tired of peekaboo.

379
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,798
Guys. Guys. Check this out.

380
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,474
Sid, the tiger found a short cut.

381
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,511
No, thanks. I choose life.

382
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,114
Then I suggest you take the short cut.

383
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,915
- Are you threatening me?
- Move, sloth!

384
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,075
Way to go, tiger.

385
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,549
Quick. Get inside.

386
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,880
OK, I vote short cut.

387
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,395
Guys, stick together.
It's easy to get lost in here.

388
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,351
Guys?

389
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,916
A fish.

390
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,479
Will you keep up, please?
Hard enough to keep track of one baby.

391
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,871
I gotcha.

392
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,229
Captain, iceberg ahead.

393
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,391
Oh, no.

394
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,795
Yeah. Who's up for round two?

395
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,071
Tell the kid to be more careful.

396
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,433
Look, look. Tigers.

397
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,951
No, it's OK, it's OK. Look, the tigers
are just playing tag with the antelope.

398
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,232
- With their teeth.
- Come on, Sid, let's play tag.

399
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,311
You're it.

400
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,512
Sure. OK, OK, OK, where are the sloths?

401
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,353
You never see any sloths.
Have you ever noticed?

402
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,876
- Look, Manny, a mammoth.
- Somebody pinch me.

403
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,032
Hey, hey, this fat one looks just like you.

404
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,110
And he's got a family.

405
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,431
And he's happy.
Look, he's playing with his kid.

406
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,069
See? That's your problem.
That's what mammoths are supposed to do.

407
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,799
- Sid...
- Find a she-mmoth, have baby mammoths...

408
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,279
- Sid.
- What?

409
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,351
- Shut up.
- But...

410
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,795
Would you look at that.

411
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,792
The tiger actually did it. There's Half Peak.

412
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,474
Next stop, Glacier Pass.

413
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:01,469
- How could I ever have doubted you?
- Did you hear that, little fella?

414
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,551
You're almost home.

415
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,514
- My feet are sweating.
- Do we need a newsflash

416
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,831
- every time your body does something?
- Ignore him.

417
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,992
Seriously. My feet are really hot.

418
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,710
Tell me that was your stomach.

419
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,916
I'm sure it was just thunder.

420
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,998
From underground?

421
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,510
Come on, keep up with me.

422
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,273
I would if you were moving.

423
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:59,597
- I wish I could jump like that.
- Wish granted.

424
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,998
- Come on, move faster.
- Have you noticed the river of lava?

425
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,431
Hold Pinky.

426
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,670
Manny.

427
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:16,156
Manny, Manny, Manny, you OK?
Come on, come on, say something. Anything.

428
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,431
What? What? I can't hear you.

429
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,750
You're standing on my trunk.

430
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:27,990
- You're OK. You're OK.
- Why did you do that?

431
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,719
You could have died, trying to save me.

432
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,588
That's what you do in a herd.

433
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,750
You look out for each other.

434
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,115
Well, thanks.

435
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:44,591
I don't know about you guys,
but we are the weirdest herd I've ever seen.

436
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,112
I can't wait to get
my claws in that mammoth.

437
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,829
No one touches the mammoth
until I get that baby.

438
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,640
First, I'll slice its hind quarters into sections.

439
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,759
- I'll put the white meat in one pile and...
- Knock it off. I'm starving.

440
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:22,389
Next, the shoulders. Occasionally
tough, but extremely juicy.

441
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,552
- I told you to knock it off.
- Save your energy.

442
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,518
Mammoths don't go down easy.

443
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,990
There's only one way to do it.

444
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,554
First, you have to force it into a corner.

445
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:38,035
Cut off its retreat.
And when you three have it trapped,

446
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,316
I'll go for the throat.

447
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,553
Guys, we gotta get this kid outta the wind.

448
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,835
- How much further?
- Three miles.

449
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,151
I'm beat. We'll get there in the morning.

450
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,675
- What are you doin'?
- I'm putting sloths on the map.

451
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,477
Why don't you make it realistic
and draw him lying down?

452
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,551
And make him rounder.

453
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,629
- Perfect.
- I forgot how to laugh.

454
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,711
I'm a genius.

455
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:39,995
From now on you'll have to
refer to me as Sid, Lord of the Flame.

456
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,476
Lord of the Flame, your tail's on fire.

457
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:54,994
Thank you. From now on,
I'm gonna call you Diego.

458
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,310
Lord of Touch Me and You're Dead.

459
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,392
I'm just kiddin', you little knucklehead.

460
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,036
Lovebirds.

461
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,111
Look at this.

462
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,871
I don't believe it.

463
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,550
Come here, you little biped.
Come here, you little wormy-worm.

464
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,756
Come to Uncle Sid.

465
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,752
No, no, no, no, no, no. This way. This way.

466
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,394
No, no, no. No, go to him.

467
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,471
Go to him.

468
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:43,988
OK.

469
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:48,915
Good job. Keep practisin'.

470
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:54,757
Look at that. Our little guy is growing up.

471
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,872
All right, come on. Sleep time, lumpy.

472
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,271
Look at that big pushover.

473
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,952
You know, Diego, I've never had
a friend who would risk his life for me.

474
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:17,512
Yeah, Manny's... he's a good guy.

475
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,911
Yeah, he is.

476
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,909
Well, good night.

477
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:59,038
Let's get you all cleaned up. What's your
daddy gonna say if you go back all stinky?

478
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:03,753
Let me just clean that up.
That looks good. A little bit here.

479
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:07,515
- You clean up nice, little fella.
- I think he's starting to look like me.

480
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,591
Diego, what do you think?

481
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,515
- Maybe we shouldn't do this.
- Why not?

482
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,229
If we save him, he'll be a hunter.
And who do you think he'll hunt?

483
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,749
Maybe because we save him,
he won't hunt us.

484
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:24,231
Yeah, and maybe he'll grow fur and
a long skinny neck and call you Mama.

485
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:29,914
- What's your problem?
- Nothing. Let's go. I'm freezing my tail off.

486
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,510
Diego. You frozen back there?

487
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,511
- Get down.
- What?

488
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,795
- Get down and follow me.
- What's goin' on?

489
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:03,715
At the bottom of Half Peak,
there's an ambush waiting for you.

490
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,995
- What?
- What do you mean, "ambush"?

491
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,190
- You set us up.
- It was my job.

492
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,716
- I was to get the baby, but then...
- You brought us home for dinner.

493
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,473
- That's it. You're out of the herd.
- I'm sorry.

494
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,551
No, you're not. Not yet.

495
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:22,275
- Listen, I can help you.
- Stay close, Sid. We can fight our way out.

496
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:25,477
You can't. The pack's too strong.
You have to trust me.

497
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:28,711
Trust you? Why in the world
would we trust you?

498
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,791
Because I'm your only chance.

499
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,836
Hello, ladies.

500
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:51,913
- Look who decided to show up.
- Diego, I was beginning to worry about you.

501
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,996
No need to worry. In about two minutes
you'll be satisfying your taste for revenge.

502
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,758
Very nice.

503
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:03,078
I see the sloth. And he's got the baby.

504
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:08,314
Don't give away your positions until you
see the mammoth. He's the one to surprise.

505
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,869
You want to maul something, don't you?

506
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:15,316
- I wanna maul.
- Then what are you waiting for?

507
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,753
No, I said wait for the mammoth.

508
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:44,917
Backscratcher. Eat my powder!

509
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,871
Loop-de-loop.

510
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,910
Slalom! Slalom, baby!

511
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:33,235
Sorry, fellas. He got a little frostbite.

512
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,791
Get him.

513
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,671
Surprise!

514
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,871
OK, follow me. We'll pick up Sid
and get outta here while we can.

515
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,748
Come on, Diego,
let's bring this mammoth down.

516
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,830
There he is.

517
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,155
That's right. Where's the baby?

518
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,031
Survival of the fittest.

519
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,839
I don't think so. Yeah.

520
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:37,912
- What are you doing?
- Leave the mammoth alone.

521
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,632
Fine. I'll take you down first.

522
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,471
We did it.

523
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,240
We were some team, huh?

524
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:17,236
Were? Come on, we're still a team.

525
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,148
I'm sorry I set you up.

526
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,359
You know me -
I'm too lazy to hold a grudge.

527
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:28,551
Knock it off, squirt.

528
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:31,436
You gotta be strong.

529
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,957
You have to take care of Manfred and Sid.

530
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:37,876
Especially Sid.

531
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:41,669
Come on, you can lick this. You're a tiger.

532
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,752
Look, I'll carry you.
Come on, what do you say?

533
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:47,035
Come on, Diego, come on.

534
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,190
Tell him he's going to be OK, Manny.

535
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:54,195
Listen, you have to leave me here.

536
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:58,319
If those humans get through the pass,
you'll never catch them.

537
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:01,878
You didn't have to do that.

538
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:04,599
That's what you do in a herd.

539
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:14,351
Don't forget about us.

540
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,431
OK?

541
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,199
We won't forget about you.

542
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,714
Goodbye.

543
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:04,155
Goodbye. Goodbye.

544
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,470
- Sid...
- Bye.

545
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,831
Bye.

546
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,789
That's right. Where's the baby?

547
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,354
Come on, Sid, let's head south.

548
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,511
Bye.

549
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,956
Save your breath, Sid.
You know humans can't talk.

550
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,431
Diego? You're OK.

551
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:46,632
- Nine lives, baby.
- You're OK.

552
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:48,711
You're OK.

553
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:51,351
I could kiss ya.

554
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,116
Welcome back, partner. Wanna lift?

555
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:58,078
No thanks. I gotta save
whatever dignity I've got left.

556
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:02,518
You're hanging out with us. Dignity's
got nothing to do with it. I'll take that lift.

557
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,034
- Yeah, climb aboard.
- Pick me up, buddy.

558
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:08,916
Mush. Or not mush. Either way.

559
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:15,034
This is gonna be the best migration ever.

560
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:19,830
I'll show you my favourite watering holes.
I turn brown when the fungus in my fur dries.

561
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,549
- Attractive.
- This whole Ice age thing is getting old.

562
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:26,837
You know what I could go for?
Global warming.

563
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:29,878
- Keep dreamin'.
- No, really...

564
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:43,357
