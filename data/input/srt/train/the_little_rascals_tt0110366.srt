Thanks Petey!

11
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:30,083
Hey Porky, look! a note.

12
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:33,125
What's it say?

13
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:40,083
We gotta learn to read ...

14
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:11,792
You ok...you ok...allright...goin' in...you ok...goin' in

Welcome

25

All raise your right hand!

26
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:19,001

30
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:38,876
do solemnly swear to be a heman
& hate women & not play with them or talk to them unless I have to.

31
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:43,459
and especially never fall in love, and if I do,

32
00:05:43,501 --> 00:05:47,918
may I die slowly &
painfully & suffer for hours or until I scream bloody murder.

33
00:05:57,876 --> 00:06:01,501
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin' Woim?

34
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:03,501
Ya, Butch ...

35
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:06,667
"What are we thinkin'?

36
00:06:06,751 --> 00:06:11,125
How much fun it's gonna be funny to stomp those guys in the race!

37
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:23,667
Ready to take down the minutes, Uh-huh?
- Uh-huh ...

38
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:28,375
As you know, today I called an emergency meeting

39
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:30,334
for a very important reason.

40
00:06:30,334 --> 00:06:33,459
But first, any good stories?

41
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:39,167
Buckwheat!
- Yes, this morning my sister left the toilet seat down..

42
00:06:39,584 --> 00:06:41,667
Woman make man miserable!

43
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:46,584
- Froggy!
- Yeah, there's this girl moved in across the street

44
00:06:46,584 --> 00:06:49,501
and she came over because she wanted to play ..

45
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,584
But don't worry, I solved it!

46
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:55,209
What did you do? (all repeat)

47
00:06:55,209 --> 00:07:03,125
I whipped out my lizard!
...(Everyone cheers)

48
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,001
Good job, Frog-man!

49
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,375
Are you getting this, Uh-huh?
-Uh-huh!

50
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:13,250
All right men, let's talk about the pride of our club: "The Blur"!

51
00:07:13,292 --> 00:07:15,918
"The Blur" is never been beaten,

52
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:20,167
since the beginning of time; five years!

53
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:26,042
This Sunday we defend our honor, our undefeated streak and our trophy!..(Everyone cheers)

54
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:30,250
First of all, this year's trophy will be presented

55
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:38,584
by none other than the famous Indy Race-car driver AJ Ferguson!

56
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:41,375
Wow! He's the best driver in the whole world!

57
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:47,584
Man! Can I have an Azuga! ..(all repeat)

58
00:07:47,584 --> 00:07:50,001
...Heeei nice "azugas"!

59
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,292
And now, the reason for the emergency meeting. The choosing of the driver!

60
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:03,834
Our driver should be a man who's all He-man!

61
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:10,959
A He-man so manly, that if he fell off a building, it hit directly over a girl!

62
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:17,834
Gentlemen, this year our driver's name is ...

63
00:08:17,834 --> 00:08:24,834
none other than my life-long chump, my best buddy in the whole wide world, the one & only ...

64
00:08:24,834 --> 00:08:30,000
Alfalfa! ..(Everyone cheers)
- O-Tay!!!

65
00:08:30,876 --> 00:08:35,584
Say, Where the heck is Alfalfa? ..(Everyone shrugs)

66
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:17,501
There he is, you guys, come on!

67
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:20,167
Quiet Petey!

68
00:09:22,626 --> 00:09:26,584
Oh no! This is awful!

69
00:09:26,626 --> 00:09:29,042
Buckwheat, hand me your fishing-pole ...

70
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:35,250
Oh, Darla, we are two hearts but with one beat!

71
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:44,918
.. two souls but wi...shoe..

72
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:49,000
And then how can you belong to that silly Woman-Haters Club?

73
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,209
You know, I am a woman ... sort of ...

74
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:58,834
Let me tell you something, Darla!!! I am not like those guys.

75
00:09:58,876 --> 00:10:01,876
I am a sensitive male ...

76
00:10:01,876 --> 00:10:09,001
I'm in the sharing, chering, feeling & healing. I'm in touch with my feminine side ..

77
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:10,209
How nice!

78
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,083
It's worse than I thought!

79
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:15,667
You know Alfalfa, the big talent show at the fair is coming up...

80
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:19,542
... and I was sort of wondering if may be you'd like to sing with me ..

81
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:22,375
You mean it? I would be honored!

82
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:26,709
I've got an idea! Let me take you on a picnic tomorrow...

83
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,334
Excuse me?

84
00:10:28,334 --> 00:10:32,000
The way you feed my soul I can ..

85
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,918
.. feed your face!

86
00:10:34,918 --> 00:10:37,751
Cool! And to prove you're proud of me...

87
00:10:37,751 --> 00:10:42,001
...why don't we have our picnic in your club-house?

88
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:43,667
No!

89
00:10:44,501 --> 00:10:50,959
Tomorrow ... tomorrow? Swimming Day! Sure!

90
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:55,918
Oh Alfalfa, you're a sweety-poo!

91
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,918
All-right, Woim! Ready for the test-run?
Ready, Butch!

92
00:11:20,751 --> 00:11:23,083
Look! There goes our bumper!

93
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:29,667
All this work for nothing ...

94
00:11:38,501 --> 00:11:43,375
Everything's working out perfectly! The guys are at the swimming pool...

95
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,834
and I'm at home with a toothache.

96
00:11:45,876 --> 00:11:48,125
Nothing can possibly go wrong!

97
00:11:51,334 --> 00:11:54,125
Hi, Butch!
-Shut up!

98
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,250
When is the last time we beat you up?

99
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:01,918
Let's see. Today is the 10th. 30 days has September...

100
00:12:01,918 --> 00:12:04,459
April, June and November ...

101
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:10,167
It's not a leap year ... yesterday...

102
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:12,709
You're due!
-Look!

103
00:12:12,751 --> 00:12:17,501
-I don't see nothing ...
-Come on, you doink!

104
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:21,125
Let's go, he can't run very fast.

105
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:23,834
Come back here, you ugly little squid!

106
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:54,334
These are for you!

107
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:07,125
Fify!... Good dog!

108
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:12,375
I hope Fify didn't sturdle you. He's so playful!

109
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:19,542
Excuse my frankness, but you're a lady rose slowly

110
00:13:19,542 --> 00:13:21,667
weeds in a garden ...

111
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:26,417
You sophistication of a woman of 12 years!

112
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:31,542
My name is Waldo Alowischiss Dromston III!

113
00:13:31,584 --> 00:13:35,292
I am Alfalfa!
Yeah, I'm sure you ...

114
00:13:35,334 --> 00:13:39,375
And I'm Darla!
-We just moved into town.

115
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,918
My father bought the oil refinery.

116
00:13:41,918 --> 00:13:44,834
That explains why you're so refined!

117
00:13:44,834 --> 00:13:46,959
Yes, and so oily!

118
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,876
Take care, buddy!

119
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:54,250
I hope ravad you soon!
-You can arrange!

120
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,125
You appear to contest the talent that will be soon!

121
00:13:57,125 --> 00:14:02,584
Yes, November 2 we will sing a duet ... together!

122
00:14:02,626 --> 00:14:05,667
How reduntant!
-Thanks ...

123
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:07,667
I gotta go.

124
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:20,542
What stallion!
-It is smoother than a baby's bottom!

125
00:14:20,542 --> 00:14:23,626
And it smells much better!

126
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,751
You're so nice that you brought me here.

127
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:04,042
A candlelit dinner! I am amazed!

128
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,667
Sorry ...

129
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:25,792
I seem to have some Vantu-banturi ..
-No problem!

130
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:29,876
grape juice?
-Yes, please!

131
00:15:37,751 --> 00:15:39,417
For us!

132
00:15:48,918 --> 00:15:52,125
It tastes like someone poured l'had a old boot!

133
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,459
In fact, from Tennessee!

134
00:15:57,417 --> 00:15:59,334
It must have been a bad year ..

135
00:16:03,918 --> 00:16:06,792
Maybe I should look in the bag!

136
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,918
What sandwich I brought you?
-That!

137
00:16:10,584 --> 00:16:13,292
What would you do instead? What's yours and mine

138
00:16:13,292 --> 00:16:16,001
and what's mine is ours!

139
00:16:16,001 --> 00:16:19,459
You know exactly what to say to a girl your breath!

140
00:16:20,626 --> 00:16:22,167
That's her breathtaking!

141
00:16:31,626 --> 00:16:34,001
Porky certainly know how to make a sand (sand), Vishal!

142
00:16:34,001 --> 00:16:36,584
But it was not sand ... it was the cat litter.

143
00:16:36,584 --> 00:16:39,083
Do not worry, it's pretty fresh!

144
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:46,834
You did a sendvis delicious!

145
00:16:46,876 --> 00:16:52,167
And you too!Very crunchy!

146
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:57,626
Maybe you should move on .. sweet!

147
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:05,083
It's a surprise!

148
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:10,375

-He had to eat

149
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:13,042
six bags of snacks with surprise to find him!

150
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:17,125
It's the symbol of my undying affection for you!

151
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,751
I love diamonds!

152
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:41,542
I misjudged, Alfalfa!You not ashamed of the woman you love!

153
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:51,042
Darla, do you mind if you ask one big and wet?

154
00:17:51,042 --> 00:17:53,918
What?
A kiss ..

155
00:17:53,918 --> 00:17:55,375
Well ..

156
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:03,001
Oh God ...Disgusting ...

157
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:12,918
Alfalfa Thanks!

158
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,709
Alfalfa open this door!

00:38:59,501 --> 00:39:02,334
It's very romantic!

Come back, freak!

392
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:26,792
And do not go!

393
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:48,083
The situation may not worsen more!

394
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:55,083
And the clouds opened up and God said: "I hate you, Alfalfa!"

395
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:58,501
Nice tan! Some last words?

Alfalfa, this is a part of you that I have ever seen!

401
00:44:06,709 --> 00:44:10,834
Darla, there is an explanation for all this,

402
00:44:10,876 --> 00:44:14,709

403

Come and you, Petey! Wait!

440
00:48:18,834 --> 00:48:21,834
Well Spanky, so things had not really emerged as ..

00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:28,292
Hey, I thought the show had to be free!

and people began to pay us.

446
00:48:38,584 --> 00:48:42,167
Buckwheat, Porky, some are geniuses!

McFarley Spanky!
-Ms. Crabtree!

450
00:48:57,709 --> 00:49:01,459
I would expect that from a child of four years, but not from you!

451
00:49:03,334 --> 00:49:06,667
Spanky, it is wrong to deceive people!

452
00:49:06,667 --> 00:49:09,042
It's like when you copy the theme!

453
00:49:09,083 --> 00:49:12,167
But me ..
What do we do with all that money?

454
00:49:12,167 --> 00:49:14,667
We can not back to all these people!

455
00:49:14,667 --> 00:49:18,959

Ms. Crabtree, you still have room for another number?

459
00:50:50,167 --> 00:50:53,751
I think you can sneak.
-Thank you, Miss Crabtree!

460
00:50:53,751 --> 00:50:55,501
You're welcome!

461
00:50:55,542 --> 00:51:04,125
Guys, I persuaded Miss Crabtree to use money as a prize to the rally!

462
00:51:06,834 --> 00:51:09,209
Imagine! In three days, the money will be ours!

00:51:36,834 --> 00:51:40,501
Anyway .. I hope you have not lost my duet with Darla.

467
00:51:40,542 --> 00:51:45,626
You call that duo?
-It was great!

468
00:51:45,626 --> 00:51:47,459
And she did not sing bad either ..

469
00:51:49,209 --> 00:51:51,501

471
00:52:11,834 --> 00:52:14,959
You do not understand?Darla you can not stand it!

Oh, dear ..

476
00:52:35,209 --> 00:52:38,292
It's a love song about a loser ..

477
00:52:38,334 --> 00:52:44,751
Long ago, I fell in love with a girl and because the best friends

478
00:52:44,751 --> 00:52:50,501
that betrayed me, she came to believe that hate women!

479
00:52:50,501 --> 00:53:00,250
But I love them!So I dedicate this cup to the girl I love most ...

480
00:53:00,292 --> 00:53:03,001
Please do not call me names, please do not tell me the name ..

481

Darla!

482
00:53:34,584 --> 00:53:37,375
I'll break this miserable pain!

483
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:17,250
I hate you, Alfalfa!

484
00:54:28,792 --> 00:54:31,334
Hello, Mr. Balloon!

485
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:37,751
It was the most painful act of love that I've seen!

486
00:54:37,751 --> 00:54:45,043
Do not talk to me, traitor! Judas!It's your fault!

487
00:54:45,042 --> 00:54:48,043
My fault?
You burn the club!

488
00:54:48,043 --> 00:54:54,959
And my fault?Really, you should guard car racing pampalaule!

489
00:54:55,001 --> 00:55:00,584
Relax, mancatorule mud, I parked it right there!

490
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:12,709
was here ...
-So where is he?

491
00:55:12,751 --> 00:55:14,542
Boy, you just mistakes!

492
00:55:14,584 --> 00:55:20,459
So far, fearful parrot!I want to have a club that you give out!

493
00:55:21,626 --> 00:55:27,334
You know, dirty and slippery ball?If would be a club, I would resign!

494
00:56:14,751 --> 00:56:16,918
Why do not you go reconcile with him, Alfalfa?

495
00:56:16,959 --> 00:56:21,167
You friends when you were a year.
-He started it!

496
00:56:21,209 --> 00:56:24,459
And you should finish it.You are a team, as Bert and Ernie,

497
00:56:24,501 --> 00:56:28,000
Superman and Clark Kent, Millie and vanilla.

498
00:56:29,334 --> 00:56:32,209
At least go and talk to him, what cost?

499
00:56:32,209 --> 00:56:34,751
I mean apart from my dignity and pride?

500
00:56:34,751 --> 00:56:41,834
All I know is that you're not a friend of life, a life!

501
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:08,959
Spanky's home?
-Sorry, Alfalfa, not e.

502
00:57:09,001 --> 00:57:11,542
I'm sorry, Spanky, Alfalfa is not here.

503
00:57:11,584 --> 00:57:16,459
Naspa!
-Naspa!

504
00:57:25,083 --> 00:57:27,167
I thought that you find here!

505
00:57:29,292 --> 00:57:34,751
I'm sorry I made eating mud.And dirty and slippery ball.

506
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:40,959
I'm sorry I made fearful and pampalau parrot!

507
00:57:40,959 --> 00:57:44,584
I'm sorry I said that spew crusty asshole!

508
00:57:44,626 --> 00:57:48,334
But you told me so!

509
00:57:48,334 --> 00:57:52,083
A. I think just a thought ..

510
00:57:53,167 --> 00:57:58,959
fire Sorry!
-I'm sorry I ruined your picnic with Darla!

511
00:57:59,667 --> 00:58:03,209
Maybe I am a little responsible for the fire ..

512
00:58:03,209 --> 00:58:09,626
You know Spanky?I like girls .. and I think it will be worse when you stop growing.

513
00:58:09,626 --> 00:58:14,876
I know you like girls, fly! The problem is that rules are rules.

514
00:58:14,918 --> 00:58:17,876
But hatred for women is the most important thing?

515
00:58:17,918 --> 00:58:21,334
I mean, can not be a club we like something?

516
00:58:23,626 --> 00:58:27,042
Yes, but without a box, we can not have a club.

517
00:58:27,042 --> 00:58:31,417
Hey, you have burned a box, not the club.

518
00:58:31,417 --> 00:58:34,667
A club is made up of friends who are together in any situation.

519
00:58:39,918 --> 00:58:45,417
I wish only that we can participate in the rally.But it's impossible!

520
00:58:45,459 --> 00:58:53,792
Who said that?We can if we work together.

521
00:59:19,542 --> 00:59:21,375
Go after materials, guys!

522
00:59:49,083 --> 00:59:51,083
He, Petey!

523
00:59:56,918 --> 00:59:59,042
screwdriver!
-Screwdriver!

524
01:00:14,918 --> 01:00:16,959
Key!
-Key!

525
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:26,501
Yo, Oh, you there?
-Oh!

526
01:00:30,292 --> 01:00:32,250
gauge!

527
01:00:39,751 --> 01:00:43,751
Make us proud, buddy!
-Definitely!

528
01:00:47,417 --> 01:00:56,292
Competitors, remember: Rally starts at 3:30.See you there.

529
01:00:56,334 --> 01:01:02,209
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls!
Welcome to the 73 th rally!

530
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:14,167
guys got into the car and get ready!

531
01:01:14,209 --> 01:01:18,834
careful not to break necks!

532
01:01:21,042 --> 01:01:23,000
How to overcome that?

533
01:01:23,042 --> 01:01:27,000
It looks like The Blur, with another layer of paint.

534
01:01:35,959 --> 01:01:40,292
We go to the rally!A place to win one!

535
01:01:40,334 --> 01:01:42,918
And you're a bad!

536
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:59,167
Well Dad, am I!I'll be so proud when I won the race!

537
01:01:59,209 --> 01:02:02,584
Waldo, you be the best that money can buy it!

538
01:02:02,626 --> 01:02:04,334
Thanks Dad!

539
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:08,751
Not bad.You are!
-Yes, you!

540
01:02:08,751 --> 01:02:12,501
Yes, you!
-Your mom is ugly!

541
01:02:15,918 --> 01:02:20,209
The streets are marked with arrows, and the race ends here.

542
01:02:20,209 --> 01:02:29,751
All right!This is a place prize.About $ 500.

543
01:02:29,751 --> 01:02:32,667
You say it's from an anonymous donor.

544
01:02:32,667 --> 01:02:33,834
It was done!

545
01:02:33,876 --> 01:02:40,042
Waldo, hurry .. I'm late!
-Be serious .. we make entry.

546
01:02:40,083 --> 01:02:42,918
Relax, relax and leave everything to me!

547
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:52,334
I wonder where is AJFerguson.
I do not know, but I can not wait to meet him.

548
01:02:52,375 --> 01:02:55,167
Well guys, put your seat belts!

549
01:02:55,167 --> 01:02:59,417
Oh, oh, Mr. Johnson.We are glad you came.

550
01:02:59,459 --> 01:03:01,584
last car is in position.

551
01:03:02,584 --> 01:03:10,501
Oh, it's even Waldo.Not to get all the money in the world

552
01:03:10,501 --> 01:03:12,209
replace work and ingenuity.

553
01:03:12,876 --> 01:03:17,709
You have a rich fantasy.
-Thanks.

554
01:03:17,751 --> 01:03:20,001
dickhead!

555
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,626
What do you do with that?
-Darla's handkerchief.

556
01:03:23,667 --> 01:03:29,667
All Knights go to battle wearing the colors of their beloved.

557
01:03:29,709 --> 01:03:32,167
I hear ...

558
01:03:37,751 --> 01:03:43,584
Look, my mother is here!
-Upiii ...

559
01:03:48,292 --> 01:03:54,876
He who would cross the finish line first will receive a gold trophy.

560
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:06,042
And also $ 500.

561
01:04:19,167 --> 01:04:22,001
Gentlemen, start your engines!

562

You bastards have stolen our car!

565
01:05:50,626 --> 01:05:54,501
Who found it, it's either.

566
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:03,584
Waldo, I think we need to return here!

567
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:08,167
girls have a sense of orientation.
-You 'gives me the pip.

568
01:06:39,792 --> 01:06:41,709
Look out!

569
01:06:47,751 --> 01:06:49,334
Excuse us!

570
01:06:53,501 --> 01:06:55,334
little bastards!

571
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:59,501
10 points for old!

572
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:08,542
It's time to leave behind the losers and guys!
Start 01:07:08:14 01:07:13:11 atomic batteries!Speed turbines!

573
01:07:20,083 --> 01:07:23,375

-Hold on!

574
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:27,626
Spins

575
01:07:38,042 --> 01:07:40,667
Active rockets!

576
01:07:46,125 --> 01:07:51,375
You idiot!You put them backwards!

577
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:11,751
And two guys?Although I hate to do this.

578
01:08:13,876 --> 01:08:17,125
spikes!

579
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:38,250
You could kill them!
-Forget that one dork who eat soap!

580
01:08:38,292 --> 01:08:41,959
So you're responsible for balloon talent contest.

581
01:08:42,001 --> 01:08:45,834
Stop!I do not want to finish the race like you!

582
01:08:45,834 --> 01:08:48,626
Yes, baby! Now get out!

583
01:08:53,334 --> 01:08:55,792
Forgive me Where are we?

584
01:09:03,918 --> 01:09:07,626
Look, we're back in the race!

585
01:09:07,626 --> 01:09:09,667
Hey, good shortcut!

586
01:09:09,709 --> 01:09:16,250
Well, how they got here?
I do not worry .. this one to "help".

587
01:09:22,292 --> 01:09:24,292
What is that?

588
01:09:27,626 --> 01:09:29,918
I can see!

589
01:09:29,959 --> 01:09:33,417

I do not see!

591
01:09:48,334 --> 01:09:51,876
My eyes, I see!

592
01:09:51,876 --> 01:09:56,001
See your nice, bogatanule!

593

Take the wheel!
-Are you crazy?

595
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:16,083
You must finish line!

596
01:10:16,125 --> 01:10:17,918
Not without it!

597
01:10:17,959 --> 01:10:19,626
You're crazy!

598
01:10:27,125 --> 01:10:29,751
careful, you fall!

599
01:10:33,292 --> 01:10:36,001

601
01:11:03,042 --> 01:11:05,000

You did Alfalfa!You won!

603
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:20,334
We did it!Everyone!

604

Gentlemen, say for Alfalfa a "Smoly-Oly!

01:11:25,459 --> 01:11:30,959
Smoly-Oly!Smoly-Oly!Smoly-Oly!

606
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:43,334

607
01:11:43,375 --> 01:11:47,584
Get ready, because now even gets hurt!

608
01:11:47,584 --> 01:11:53,375

Yes hand, buddy.You're an honorable guy!

615
01:12:26,292 --> 01:12:30,751
You know, we have a club of "men who hate women"

616
01:12:30,751 --> 01:12:36,250
Alfalfa, trying to bring a member in May.What?

617
01:12:36,292 --> 01:12:41,167
Not Waldo!
-You will hear from my lawyers!

618
01:12:42,626 --> 01:12:46,334
So who's the guy who saved us butts?

619
01:12:46,334 --> 01:12:50,083
Hi guys, how are you?
-A girl!

620
01:12:52,667 --> 01:12:54,459
It outran them all.

621
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:06,167
It is my pleasure to hand over the trophy and money

622
01:13:06,167 --> 01:13:11,000
Swietzer Alfalfa and Spanky's McFarley.

623
01:13:15,459 --> 01:13:18,501
You're licking cow happy to see me?

624
01:13:20,459 --> 01:13:23,334
Genre: silent and strong, right?

625
01:13:23,375 --> 01:13:28,209
do not take it personally, lady, but my friend is very disappointed.

626
01:13:28,209 --> 01:13:31,001
What happened pie?

627
01:13:31,043 --> 01:13:37,167
Well, hopefully AJFerguson we handed over the trophy ...

628
01:13:37,167 --> 01:13:45,501
Guys, today is your lucky day, for exactly what I am!

629
01:13:45,542 --> 01:13:53,292
You're the best driver in the world!
-Thanks a lot!Nothing you have not been below!

630

631
01:14:02,584 --> 01:14:04,542
Here!

632
01:14:17,417 --> 01:14:20,167
I saw what you did with my Batistuta, Alfalfa!

633
01:14:20,167 --> 01:14:25,001
my heart melted.
-And very romantic!

634
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,083
Thanks .. but I thought you hate me.

635
01:14:28,125 --> 01:14:31,792
I hate you .. just sometimes do bad things.

636
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:37,542
As if, at the picnic.
-Can I explain it.

637
01:14:37,542 --> 01:14:42,918
I've ruined your Picnic with alfalfa.You see, I thought trying to

638
01:14:42,918 --> 01:14:47,792
steal my best friend.I thought trying to sabotage our club.

639
01:14:47,792 --> 01:14:52,667
