1
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,548
FBI! Pull over, now!

2
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,314
You want to go?

3
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,916
No! You will not get your mail
till I get to your house.

4
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,759
Don't make me use the PITmaneuver.

5
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,235
I will get to your house
when I get to your house!

6
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,555
Get out of the truck.

7
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,835
Put your hands in the air.

8
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,028
What is wrong with you?
You could've stopped back there.

9
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,752
You made me have to chase you, man.

10
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,235
Please, God, let someone
be taping this in the bushes.

11
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,794
- Just give me what I want.
- Whoa, whoa.

12
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,878
That's a federal offense, all right?
Only the mailman touches the mail.

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,752
You do realize I'm packing, don't you?

14
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,029
Yeah.

15
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,718
I could pop one in your ass!

16
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,792
Okay. All right, all right. Just relax.

17
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,718
- Do I gotta pop one?
- Chill-ax. Okay?

18
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,149
I got your mail right here.

19
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,916
Okay. Capital One credit card
with no introductory interest rate.

20
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,430
- No. No.
- Okay. Fair enough.

21
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,396
Steam Clean Carpet Service.

22
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,631
- No.
- Okay, true dat, true dat.

23
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,551
Duke University! Boo-ya!

24
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,312
Come here! Come here!

25
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,158
Come here!

26
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,712
Come here! Come here! I'm warning you.

27
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,712
I know it's college decision day,

28
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,671
but you win the crazy parent award!

29
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,392
Thick. Thick, thick.

30
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,437
My boy got in. My boy got in!

31
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,473
Thank you.

32
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,035
Hey!

33
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,789
Don't be surprised
when I lose your tax refund!

34
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,559
Hey! Trent!

35
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,549
Trent!

36
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,034
You up there?

37
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,754
Trent, you're on your way.

38
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,711
- Desert Retreat.
- Hi.

39
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,308
I need to speak to my wife, Sherrie.

40
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,351
I'm sorry, no phone calls allowed.

41
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,392
Yeah, well, I know no phone calls allowed,

42
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,833
but, you see, it's an emergency.
Our son just got accepted...

43
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,952
Sir, your wife is in complete isolation
for the next 72 hours.

44
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,117
Come on. It's a mind-body retreat.

45
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,559
It's not Area 51.

46
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,477
Please take a soothing breath with me.

47
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,876
No, I will not
take a soothing breath with you.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,672
- Namaste.
- But I can come down there

49
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,279
and snatch that ponytail off your head.

50
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,435
Namaste.

51
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,197
Duke University.

52
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,357
What? Malcolm?

53
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,200
- Speaking.
- It's Jason Bourne.

54
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,150
I told you, we don't use code names.

55
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,669
You take all the fun away,
Chocolate Thunder, you know that?

56
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,279
All right. What do you want, Nicky?

57
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,111
The exchange is tonight, 11:00 p.m.

58
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,908
- You got what they want?
- Yeah, as long as you got what I want.

59
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,754
And listen, I'm thinking now Bali.

60
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,472
Well, you know, there's
no witness protection program in Bali.

61
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,636
But don't worry,
we're gonna take care of you.

62
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,278
All right, then Mexico. But not Cabo!
It's gotten way too touristy.

63
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,678
Hello? Chocolate?

64
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,318
- Trent!
- Hey, Malcolm.

65
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,715
- Where are you?
- I'm... I'm at the library.

66
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,193
- Library.
- Yeah.

67
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,436
- But it's noisy.
- It's Book Appreciation Day.

68
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,400
But look. Trent, we need to talk, all right?

69
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,557
So, come home soon. We got to talk.

70
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,352
- I'm losing you.
- All right.

71
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,039
Yeah!

72
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,071
I'm a lyrical miracle

73
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,553
- Hey!
- Baby!

74
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,352
Quick-witted
better get with it, stay sick with it

75
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,869
They saying I'm a lyrical miracle

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,399
- Hey!
- Baby

77
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,353
I'm automatic, a rap fanatic
Let me do my thing

78
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,074
This is how I do it
Fluid, every time I ride by

79
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,192
I'm so incredible
They're forgettable, bye-bye

80
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,834
You know my name
If you didn't hear it, then here it go

81
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,793
I be that lyrical miracle
With the witty flow

82
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,753
Looking at that shorty, she's a cutie
What's your name?

83
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,872
Baby, you should call me
I can scoop you and we can hang

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,070
Okay, if not
Then I ain't twisting your arm

85
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,192
But don't be trying to holler at me
When you're singing along

86
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,390
I'm a lyrical miracle

87
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,714
- Hey!
- Baby

88
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,478
Quick-witted, better get with it
Stay sick with it

89
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,034
They saying
I'm a lyrical miracle

90
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,513
- Hey!
- Baby

91
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,108
I'm automatic, a rap fanatic
Let me do my thing

92
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,759
Hey, y'all, the Prodi-G's a little parched.

93
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,598
I'll be back for a second set, a'ight?

94
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,478
- Library?
- How'd you find me?

95
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,919
The Bureau tracked your phone.

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,433
Thank God my dad's an orthodontist.

97
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,120
For real.
That's some Nazi Germany shnizzle.

98
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,958
Let's talk, now.

99
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,752
Scratch and Rembrandt are my family.

100
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,474
Whatever you got to say,
you can say in front of them.

101
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,749
Oh, family.

102
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,399
All right, well, in my family,
we give out ass-whuppin's.

103
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,713
And right now, I'm looking at
a lot of fresh, unwhupped ass!

104
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,510
Yeah. A little... This little...

105
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,152
You have a great day, Mr. Turner!

106
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,715
Hey, Trent, we love you,
but I ain't with no ass-whuppin'.

107
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,673
- Yo, hold it down. Sell some CDs!
- Okay.

108
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,476
- Why'd you embarrass me like that?
- I'm embarrassing you?

109
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,750
- Trent, you got a lot to learn.
- Come on, Malcolm.

110
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,153
You know, it wouldn't hurt
to call me "Dad" every once in a while.

111
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,479
All right, let's rewind.
This should be a happy day. All right?

112
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,110
Yeah, but I ain't the one
who brought the rain.

113
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,673
Some great news came in.

114
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,075
I know. They called me.

115
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,916
Yeah, I'm just like,
wait till they hear my new stuff.

116
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,396
Right? I'm talking about fire, man!

117
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,636
New stuff? What are you talking about?

118
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,718
Wait. What are you talking about?

119
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,193
I'm talking about Duke!

120
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,796
No, look, forget college, man.

121
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,155
So check this out.
This promoter got a hold of my mix tape.

122
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,589
The Achievement, Volume One. Right?

123
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,310
So, he's putting together this tour
of young MCs in the fall and the winter

124
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,115
called The Freshman Class, right?
Entire East Coast and Cincinnati!

125
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,075
Trent. People don't go to Cincinnati.
They leave Cincinnati.

126
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,553
The only catch is

127
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,991
I'm not 18 yet, so I'm gonna
need you to sign this contract.

128
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,633
Because the Prodi-G is still a minor.

129
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,955
- In age only.
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

130
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,039
You got into Duke today.
You're a Blue Devil now!

131
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,276
- So?
- So that's your dream!

132
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,993
No, that's your dream.

133
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,918
I ain't going to no lame college
when I can be on the road, making money!

134
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,236
I ain't signing that contract.

135
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,239
You gotta give it a rest.

136
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,908
I'm just saying, this is my big break, man!

137
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,270
And if I don't have
the contract signed in five days,

138
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,756
they're gonna have some wack
ringtone rapper from St. Louis.

139
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,075
Trent, you have the rest of your life
to go on the road.

140
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,198
But for these next four years...

141
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,639
Four years?

142
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,751
You're joking, right? You're joking.

143
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,269
Like, you know how long that is
in hip-hop years?

144
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,994
Come on, Malcolm, look at this. Look.

145
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,676
It's a blueprint for a house of success.
All built on a strong, strong flow.

146
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,518
- A strong flow.
- Yeah.

147
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,157
Well, you need an education.

148
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,555
What are you gonna do
when that flow dries up?

149
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,955
I'll just transition into acting.

150
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,599
Oh, man. Every time you open your mouth,

151
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,510
you prove to me just how important
an education really is.

152
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,876
You're lucky your mother's not here
to hear you talk that crazy talk.

153
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,879
Oh, Mom. Let's call Mom. She'll let me.
Let's ring Mom up.

154
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,515
Go ahead, call her. When you tell her
that you want to throw away college,

155
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,393
she's probably gonna bust
that little vein in her forehead.

156
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,714
It's gonna pop!

157
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,273
Yeah...

158
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,119
Okay. But not when she sees the mansion
I'm gonna buy her.

159
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,389
Come on.

160
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,479
Only thing I'm signing
is a check to Duke. End of story.

161
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,151
Now if you'll excuse me,
I've gotta go to work.

162
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,315
You know, some of us work.

163
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,874
- I'm on the grind. You feel me?
- I feel you.

164
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,274
- You feel me?
- Yeah, I feel you.

165
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,873
- You feel?
- Yeah.

166
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,588
But I'm talking swimming pools.
You feeling private security.

167
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,392
Come on, we can do it together, Malcolm!

168
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,275
Damn!

169
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,639
- Trent.
- What's up, man?

170
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,718
- Hey, did he sign it?
- No, he didn't sign it yet.

171
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,312
All right, so phase two.
Ambush the man when he's at his grind.

172
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,715
He'll give you an autograph
just to get rid of you.

173
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,719
Yeah. Ambush him at his grind.
I'm feeling you.

174
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,068
That's right!

175
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,960
See? That's why I keep you on payroll.

176
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,680
Hands away from your chest.
You're gonna dirty the recording.

177
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,438
- Sorry.
- You got the drive, right?

178
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,515
Yeah.

179
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,160
- There's nothing on this.
- Smart, huh?

180
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,679
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

181
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,190
It's insurance. 'Cause I was thinking,
what if they don't give me the money?

182
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,551
What if they check the drive, just like I did?

183
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,553
Well, the real one's hidden.

184
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,194
It's in a safe place where no one will
ever look, so don't worry about it.

185
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,594
You idiot. Where is it?

186
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,597
Where's my witness protection plan?

187
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,637
It's gonna be in a casket
if you don't tell me where it is.

188
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,835
All right.

189
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,273
- The Georgia Girls School for the Arts.
- What?

190
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,309
- I got a buddy who works there.
- Unbelievable!

191
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,310
Crawford. Yeah, Malcolm.

192
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,995
Canetti brought a dummy flash.

193
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,233
Yeah, well, he told me where
the real one is, but there's no time.

194
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,754
We're just gonna have to get Chirkoff
to make the exchange. Yeah.

195
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,108
All right.

196
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,353
Hey. Let's go.

197
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,879
Canetti, can you hear me?

198
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,353
Yeah, I got you, Chocolate. Go ahead.

199
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,948
Look, if anything goes wrong,
get out of there.

200
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,470
Hey, fellas. Vlad and Dmitri, right?

201
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,319
Mr. Chirkoff.

202
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,032
Hey, it's good to see you again.

203
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,950
Rosetta Stone. Pretty good, huh?

204
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,236
Whoa, whoa! It's the Prodi-G!

205
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,671
Trent, what the hell are you doing here?

206
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,838
Guaranteeing my future. Sign my contract.

207
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,518
Hey, get in here and sit down! Stay down!

208
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,389
You think I'm stupid, huh?
You think I'm a stupid man.

209
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,277
No, I think you're probably very intelligent.

210
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,515
I mean, I don't know you that well.

211
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,312
Autograph it, please.

212
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,114
- I'm not talking to you.
- Who are you talking to?

213
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,391
I'm talking to the people
on the other end of your chest.

214
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,675
This? There's nobody there, man.
This is part of my hearing aid.

215
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,075
- Get out of the car and hide, now.
- What's going on?

216
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,599
- Get out of the car and hide, now!
- What's going on?

217
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,758
I'm hard of hearing in my right ear.

218
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,472
- Really? Show me.
- Yeah.

219
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,033
- I can't show you. It's...
- Show me!

220
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,435
All right. Take it easy. Take it easy.
I'll show you everything.

221
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,916
FBI! Come and get your snitch!

222
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,953
You want to come and play?

223
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,828
Drop it.

224
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,075
Drop it!

225
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,998
All right. Give me Canetti, or I take him out.

226
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,355
Music...

227
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,155
What?

228
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,312
It's in the music...

229
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,714
Yo. Look...

230
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,114
I didn't see anything. Yo, we cool?

231
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,515
Come on, man! Come on!

232
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,438
Come on.

233
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,588
Oh, my God, they're shooting!
Where are we going?

234
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,030
- Get in the truck.
- Okay, okay!

235
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,949
Oh, my God!

236
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,754
Get down!

237
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,710
- Are you okay?
- I think so.

238
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,429
Do you have any idea
how lucky we are right now?

239
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,437
You could have been killed!
What were you thinking?

240
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,028
He just shot that guy right in front of me.

241
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,037
We're still here, all right?
That's what matters.

242
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,912
Shouldn't we call the FBI or something?

243
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,998
No. FBI has got a leak.
Chirkoff knew we were coming.

244
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,553
Malcolm, I want to go home, man.

245
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,717
Trent. Your car's back there.
They probably already ran your tags.

246
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,877
They know everything about us.
You just saw Chirkoff murder someone.

247
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,672
- We can't go home.
- So, what, then?

248
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,438
That means he's gonna kill me?

249
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,198
Come on! That is not hot.

250
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,756
I won't let him. All right?
All I got to do is get that flash drive.

251
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,434
It has enough dirt on Chirkoff
to put him away forever.

252
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,039
Payoff, hits, everything.

253
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,032
Canetti told me where the flash is hidden.

254
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,276
We're just gonna lay low
until I can get my hands on it.

255
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,678
Just calm down, all right? Relax.
Take a soothing breath.

256
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,158
They haven't called in yet
and you have no idea where they are.

257
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,713
You're the FBI!

258
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,718
What good is a leak
if you can't tell me anything?

259
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,637
Just send me the photo.

260
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,629
- How's the leg, boss?
- The leg's fine!

261
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,671
The FBI's run travel records,
rental cars. Nothing.

262
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,157
They haven't left the area, at least not yet.

263
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,318
- What about the flash drive?
- Turner knows where it is.

264
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,750
We find Turner, we find the flash drive.

265
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,235
Right now, our biggest problem's his kid.

266
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,237
He saw me shoot Canetti.

267
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,316
I want him dead.

268
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,678
I got 15 MP3s of original stuff
that ain't been mixed.

269
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,835
You can have that.

270
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,835
Georgia Girls School for the Arts.

271
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,076
You know what, just do like Pac's mom did.

272
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,589
After I'm shot down in the streets,
just release it as a double jam.

273
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,753
Would you knock off the crazy talk?
We gonna get out of this.

274
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,719
Yeah. That's probably what Biggie thought

275
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,319
when he was staring down the barrel.

276
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,240
Or Pac, when he was chilling on the Strip.

277
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,755
I got a plan.

278
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,514
You know what? Malcolm,

279
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,870
- just promise me one thing.
- What?

280
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,952
Don't let them do a clean version
for Walmart.

281
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,599
Preserve who the Prodi-G was.

282
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,469
- I'm going to hide you.
- Hide?

283
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,951
I mean, come on. How you gonna
hide a swag as big as this?

284
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,711
I'm gonna need a shrink
after this, you realize that?

285
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,558
You didn't seem to mind
when you was little and

286
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,955
I caught you trying on your mother's...

287
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,469
You promised never to bring that up.
I was putting on a play.

288
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,718
Lord, Lord! You a difficult child,
Charmaine Daisy Pierce.

289
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,398
Who are you talking about?

290
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,590
My great-niece.
And you better start sounding like her

291
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,234
- before you scare someone.
- Oh, right.

292
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,759
In that case, how's this?

293
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,836
Swing low, sweet...

294
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,596
Holy mother of...

295
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,508
Yeah. Yeah, right there.
Now remember that feeling.

296
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,080
Fine! If I gotta be a chick,
can I at least be a cute one?

297
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,760
Next time I'll buy my own damn clothes!

298
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,638
And pull down that skirt!

299
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,557
I can see straight to the Promised Land.

300
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,478
It's pulled down!

301
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,598
After a while, you realize
it's just not worth the fight.

302
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,036
I wasn't even talking to you.

303
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,435
Nosy and all in my business!

304
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,119
Wait up!

305
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,789
I don't understand how we're gonna find
a 4-inch flash drive in 3-inch heels.

306
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,512
Canetti had a buddy who works here.

307
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,030
We start by finding out who that is,
and what they know.

308
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,999
Canetti.

309
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,839
Canetti, yeah.

310
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,150
Canetti said something to me
right before he died.

311
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,430
He looked at me and he said...

312
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,350
- What'd he say?
- "It's in the music."

313
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,272
Yeah. You know, something like that.

314
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,834
And I thought he recognized my talent,
knew who the Prodi-G was.

315
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,234
- "It's in the music"?
- Yeah.

316
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,319
Doesn't make sense,

317
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,749
just like everything else
that comes out of your mouth.

318
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,440
What? I'm gonna tell you
what don't make sense.

319
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,189
How they gonna let two fat ladies
go poking around this joint?

320
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,914
They have an opening for a house mother.

321
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,389
Say what?

322
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,069
Park your tush.

323
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,596
Tuck it! Right over there.

324
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,718
- Hi, girl. Hi.
- Hi.

325
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,149
Hi.

326
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,592
She's expecting me. I's running a little late.

327
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,109
Come in!

328
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,349
May I help you?

329
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,869
Honey, it's me who's gonna help you,

330
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,708
and those poor,
house motherless girls you got

331
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,671
just waiting for a positive role model.

332
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,835
Hattie Mae Pierce at your service,
but you can call me Big Momma.

333
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,479
Oh, yes. You e-mailed your résumé
for the house mother position.

334
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,359
Very qualified, but I think...

335
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,198
Well, thank you!

336
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,153
I will watch over those girls
like they were my own.

337
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,919
But, Miss...

338
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,596
Big Momma, we haven't
scheduled any interviews, let alone...

339
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,073
Look at what those children did to me!

340
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,957
Performance art, my ass!

341
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,752
Beverly, what on earth?

342
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,718
Double-ply?
A public school can afford double-ply

343
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,432
and I got to bring in my own Sweet'N Low?

344
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,595
Child, nobody deserves
to be treated like that.

345
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,519
That's not the half!

346
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,878
Damn!

347
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,633
Child, you should quit
while you can still do a comb over.

348
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,275
No, Beverly,
you promised us two weeks' notice.

349
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,393
You know, every day you don't demand
respect, you die just a little.

350
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,039
You die a little.

351
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:59,119
You know, she's right. Nothing's worth
living with those demon spawn!

352
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,198
"No child left behind."

353
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,875
Well, you watch me. I quit!

354
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,949
Can you start today?

355
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,198
Me? Thank you! Sure!

356
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,278
- Now, we don't pay very much.
- Don't worry about that.

357
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,072
Shoot, I grew up so poor,

358
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,918
we used to go down
to Kentucky Fried Chicken

359
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,393
and lick other people's fingers.

360
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,033
Because we couldn't afford the chicken.

361
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,233
And you know, all the grease
from the chicken, we were like...

362
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,194
You know, there is one tiny little issue.

363
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,069
What's that?

364
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,348
Hey. What up?

365
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,912
Miss Gail, this is my great-niece,

366
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,952
Charmaine Daisy Pierce.

367
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,354
- Hello.
- Hey.

368
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,677
So many girls!
I feel like I'm at a Baskin-Robbins.

369
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,552
A festival of flavors!

370
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,709
I mean, it's so diverse here.

371
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,117
Yes. Well, we do pride ourselves
on diversity.

372
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,918
So tell me, Charmaine, do you think
that you're a good fit for GGSA?

373
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,476
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like to read.

374
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,795
And I like to

375
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,239
play music.

376
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,957
And I like salad.

377
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,877
Sweet, delicious, fresh fruit salad.

378
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,036
She's had a stressful few days.

379
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,118
She's only with me because of
some family problems.

380
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,595
My parents don't support my art.

381
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,948
They think it's a waste of time.

382
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,755
Oh, dear, that is awful.
Well, you have come to the right place.

383
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,871
And my stepfather's always working.

384
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,752
He has an important job in the government.

385
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,552
Which he uses to spy on me.

386
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,240
Ever told the truth, wouldn't have to.

387
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,072
Charmaine, you can audit classes
until we get your transcripts get here,

388
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,792
but I'm afraid, since it's the end of the year,

389
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,319
we don't have a roommate for you.

390
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,112
Any ol' girl will do.

391
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,958
No. We don't want to put you out.

392
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,395
Charmaine'll just stay
with her Big Momma.

393
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,115
But my shrink in juvie said I'd do
better with a role model my own age.

394
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,912
You'll be on the same floor as your peers.

395
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,189
Before you know it,
you'll be bosom buddies.

396
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,788
Charmaine likes the sound of that!

397
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,271
Welcome to your new home.

398
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,398
I'll just show you to your room.

399
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,592
Some of the girls have gone to dinner,
so you'll just see them there.

400
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,995
- Okay.
- There's Mia! Mia.

401
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,429
Damn!

402
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,312
Mia, this is your new house mother,
Big Momma,

403
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,795
and this is her niece, Charmaine,
your new classmate.

404
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,072
- Hi.
- Mia is a very promising young actress.

405
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,433
I'm okay. I mean, I can do light comedy,
like Sandra Bullock.

406
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,278
Well, you know, before the Oscar.

407
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,311
But I really need to work on
expanding my range,

408
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,873
in the way that Kate Winslet does.

409
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,468
And Mrs. Orth from Movement says
that I need to listen to my inner voice,

410
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,874
but there's just so many of them,

411
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,595
and the loudest one's always screaming,
"Delanté's pulling away!"

412
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,039
My God! Delanté's pulling away.

413
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,359
I think I should go now.

414
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,833
Girl, you need a hug!

415
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,188
She gets a little emotional.
Who the hell is Delanté?

416
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,437
Delanté is the boyfriend.

417
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,032
Gail, maybe we should freshen up
before dinner.

418
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,830
All this transition is a bit much
for Charmaine.

419
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,871
She should probably rest her eyes

420
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,594
or become unconscious
for a moment or two.

421
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,712
I totally understand.
Your room is at the end of the hall.

422
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,359
Well, look at the wallpaper! It's so nice!

423
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,113
Look. There's a ballerina on the bed.

424
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,193
I'm Jasmine.

425
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,156
And here's the 411
you probably didn't get on your tour.

426
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,992
I call the shots around here.

427
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,634
So, if you two stay out of the way,
we shouldn't have any problems.

428
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,829
Okay?

429
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,474
Now you listen to me, Tinker Bell.

430
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,429
Big Momma don't take orders from nobody.

431
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,115
Nobody.

432
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,798
We'll see about that.

433
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,554
Towel girl was nice.

434
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,279
I'm going to unpack.

435
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,074
You mind? Do you mind?

436
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,554
Sit down with such lovely young ladies.

437
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,428
Excuse me.

438
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,039
Charmaine!

439
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,758
Find a seat.

440
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,398
- Sit next to me.
- All right.

441
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,112
Thank you. Excuse me.

442
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,159
Careful. Oh, my gosh.
Here, let me help clean you up.

443
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,838
It's cool.

444
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,595
I'm Haley Robinson.

445
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,633
Hey!

446
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,752
You're...

447
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,269
You're the hot girl
from the Promenade. Yeah.

448
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,549
I'm sorry?

449
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,275
I mean, you're not hot.

450
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,873
The Promenade was hot the day I saw you.

451
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,110
I'm not saying you're not hot,

452
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,196
but it was hot at the Promenade the day
I saw you being hot. Girl, I'm hot.

453
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,915
- I'm Charmaine.
- You're funny.

454
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,399
I love that beat.

455
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,956
That's it. Excuse me, but I didn't
formally get to introduce myself.

456
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,996
My name is Hattie Mae Pierce,
but everyone calls me Big Momma.

457
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,350
That's the understatement of the century.

458
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,755
Funny. Very funny.

459
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,439
And this is my niece,
Charmaine Daisy Pierce.

460
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,511
Hey. How you guys doing?

461
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,669
That reminds me.
You have to do something before you eat.

462
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,713
Girl, of course!

463
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,799
- Attention, everyone!
- Give...

464
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,073
We have fresh meat that wants to eat.

465
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,436
And what kind of school is this?

466
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,278
School for the Arts!

467
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,712
Exactly. And that means every new student

468
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,037
must dance, act or sing for their supper.

469
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,794
What'll it be, Charmaine?

470
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,439
What's your talent?

471
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,353
Show us what you got.

472
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,799
Show us what you got.

473
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,594
Show us what you got.
Show us what you got.

474
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,079
Charmaine...

475
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,188
Quiet! Quiet!

476
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:00,076
Anyway, Charmaine
is a little under the weather right now.

477
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,553
Maybe she could do it another night.

478
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,831
No, it's all right, Big Momma. I got this.

479
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,993
So what'll it be, Charmaine?

480
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,029
I'm a rapper.

481
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,478
I can't wait to see this.

482
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,831
Hey, could somebody give me a beat?

483
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,349
Yeah.

484
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,709
What

485
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,789
Yeah

486
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,115
All my girls in the spot
You know what's up

487
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,117
Just chillin' in the caf
For some laughs and stuff

488
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,117
Ready to do my thing
Y'all ready or what?

489
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,710
Show your girl some love
Hah... Yeah... What...

490
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,271
Hello? All girls school?

491
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,119
Give your girl some love.

492
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,118
Don't wanna give it up?
Yeah, I'm cool with that

493
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,071
That's fine
Besides, who knew I could rap?

494
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,236
I got skills, thrills
Plus a winning attitude

495
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,316
I got no time for no wack dudes

496
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,078
You don't even know
What I got under here

497
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,033
If you feel the same way
Let me hear you say, "Hell, yeah!"

498
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,388
Hell, yeah!

499
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,795
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh!

500
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,911
Ain't nobody

501
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,350
Loves me better
Makes me happy

502
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,877
Makes me feel this way

503
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,394
Ain't nobody

504
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,469
Loves me better than you

505
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,312
Yeah
My girl Haley is the truth

506
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,431
And even though I'm new
she done made it real smooth

507
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,391
It's kind of hard
being new on the block

508
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,192
Especially when
you're packin' a supersized

509
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,395
Badonkadonk!

510
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,909
Whoa

511
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,712
Ain't nobody

512
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,592
Loves me better

513
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,712
Makes me happy

514
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,837
Makes me feel this way

515
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,393
Ain't nobody

516
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,549
Loves me better than you

517
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,316
Yo, Haley, get up on the mic
Keep talking about the guy you like

518
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,749
First you put your arms around me

519
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,319
Then what else did he do, girl?

520
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,431
Then you put your charms around me

521
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,312
Okay
Do you think he'd be true?

522
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,715
I can't resist your sweet surrender

523
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,319
Sounds like a good deal to me

524
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,670
Oh, my nights are warm and tender

525
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,319
Come on! Everybody sing!

526
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,752
Ain't nobody

527
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,394
Loves me better

528
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,553
Makes me happy

529
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,871
Makes me feel this way

530
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,312
- Ain't nobody loves me better
- Nobody loves me better

531
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,712
Gonna love me better than you

532
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,310
Go, Momma! Go, Momma!
Go, Momma! Go, Momma!

533
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,837
Oh, my gosh! Big Momma, are you okay?
Are you alive?

534
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,793
Ain't nobody?

535
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,909
Child? That there is no meal.

536
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,593
I'm on a diet.

537
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,077
Prima ballerinas can't have any booty.
There's a law or something.

538
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,197
Well, she looks so skinny,

539
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,834
it looks like she could dodge raindrops.

540
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,959
Ain't no raindrops going...

541
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,753
- Oh, my God!
- Mia, what's going on?

542
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,114
Delanté just dumped me.

543
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,514
- What?
- What?

544
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,555
"Need space. Still friends?"

545
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,518
He used the sunglasses guy.

546
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,512
You know what?
He's probably just confused.

547
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,314
Yeah, he's afraid of intimacy.
He just doesn't want to get hurt.

548
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,749
You think?

549
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,113
Can't you girls read?
A man needs his space.

550
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,550
It says it clearly in black and white.

551
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,955
Duh!

552
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,029
Oh, my God.

553
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,755
Or

554
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,918
he's petrified by his passion

555
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,038
and he doesn't know how to deal with it.

556
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,789
Girl, the sunglasses guy means
he's hiding his true emotions.

557
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,239
He loves you, girl.

558
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,554
Exactly.

559
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,873
Child, like my Aunt Yorima used to say,

560
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,237
it's better to be alone with yourself
for the rest of your life

561
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,397
than to be together with bad company
for a minute.

562
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,194
I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life?

563
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,788
- Child, I did not say that.
- No, Mia, don't listen to her.

564
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,390
- Oh, my God, I can't do this!
- Mia, no!

565
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,670
- I was trying to give her...
- Great job, Big Momma.

566
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,869
Any other hearts you want to break?

567
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,200
Ladies, quiet down, please!

568
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,028
Thank you. I have an announcement.

569
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,516
Last night,
an antique music box was stolen

570
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,517
from our library's special collection.

571
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,759
Now, I know we have a tradition of pranks.

572
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,869
But this is not stealing the mascot
from the boys at St. Ignatius.

573
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,595
Which is still missing, by the way.

574
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,039
No, this is a crime

575
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,079
against one of our own,
which will not be tolerated!

576
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,678
So I strongly suggest that the guilty party,

577
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,190
or anyone who knows anything
about this, come forward

578
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,311
or risk immediate expulsion.

579
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,072
The music box. That's what Canetti
was trying to tell you.

580
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,909
- What do you mean?
- The flash drive's in the music box!

581
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,598
Right, right.

582
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,234
Come on. We're going to the library.
That's where it was stolen.

583
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,713
- I just...
- Where are you going?

584
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,308
These shoes! They hurt. They're heels.

585
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,829
And this girdle's riding up
all inside me. I can't do it.

586
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,997
All right, but stay in your room
and away from those girls.

587
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,348
All right.

588
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,397
I gotta take a leak.

589
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,229
Ah, man.

590
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,238
This thing is so tight!

591
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,870
Free at last, free at last.

592
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,989
Yeah?

593
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,955
Charmaine?

594
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,073
I'll be out in a second!

595
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,075
Give me...

596
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,316
- Are you all right in there?
- Yeah!

597
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,353
I'm okay!

598
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,114
I'll be out there in a minute!

599
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,635
Hey...

600
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,359
Damn. I mean...

601
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,594
Hey, Haley.

602
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,671
I hope I'm not being too personal,
but have you tried Spanx?

603
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,349
Spanx?

604
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,109
You know, body shapers.

605
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,508
You know, they give you the smoothing
without the extra padding.

606
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,753
Really?

607
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,470
That extra padding!

608
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:36,149
Anyway, they're having a thing for me
in the common room in about 15 minutes.

609
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,793
I'd love you to come.

610
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,876
How nice of you. That'd be great.

611
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,196
- Great. So, I'll see you in a few.
- All right.

612
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,550
And wear your PJs. We go comfy.

613
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,634
You certainly do.

614
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,479
Excuse me!

615
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,032
Excuse me!

616
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,233
My, my, my.

617
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,229
Lord.

618
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,592
My, my, my!

619
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,073
I'm peeping one fly Zulu queen!

620
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,318
Well, the name is Hattie Mae Pierce,
but everybody calls me Big Momma.

621
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,958
Well, I'm Kurtis Kool.
I make the ladies drool.

622
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:50,590
Well, that's nice, but I'm gonna
keep my saliva in my mouth.

623
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,909
Well, back in the day,
I used to run the ropes for Run-DMC.

624
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,113
You probably recognize me
from my appearance in Krush Groove.

625
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,037
I was the brother
with the dope shammy in the car wash.

626
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,518
I had no lines, but I was good. No?

627
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,350
My last tour was with LL Cool J.

628
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,354
In the words of the great master,
"Mama said knock you out!"

629
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,635
Young man.

630
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,073
I am a woman with grandchildren.

631
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,470
Now, I'm the new house mother
over in Pryce Hall.

632
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,634
And I'm just trying to get a lay of the land.

633
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,193
I was wondering

634
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,948
if I could get a peek around the library.

635
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,670
Well, Kurtis Kool be your backstage pass!

636
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,315
- Kurtis Kool!
- Let me get my key.

637
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,756
Well, all right. Shed a little light.

638
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,633
You know, my momma said
big-legged women were gonna kill me.

639
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,758
Found my keys!

640
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,352
- You ready to go?
- Yeah. This way?

641
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,876
Halle Berry ain't got shit on you!

642
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,109
Hello.

643
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,676
Lord, I must be in heaven.

644
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,555
Who invited America's sexiest buffalo?

645
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,553
I invited her.

646
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,954
Be nice.

647
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,475
Oh, no.

648
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,389
What are we doing,
sacrificing an animal or something?

649
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,719
We are the Divas.

650
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,078
The senior society of GGSA's best artists.

651
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,553
This is our inner sanctum.

652
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,952
Can we trust her not to narc us out?

653
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,669
- I ain't no narc.
- That's what a narc would say.

654
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,711
- That's true.
- Good point.

655
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,230
Good point? Girl,

656
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:52,478
let me tell you something
about Charmaine Daisy Pierce.

657
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,515
My ex-boyfriend, right?

658
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,109
Marlo.

659
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,831
Doing a bid in Lompoc. Dealing.

660
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,828
Po-po dragged me in
on a trumped-up conspiracy case.

661
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,872
Said if I testified against him, I could walk.

662
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,514
- Know what I did?
- What?

663
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,471
Spent my 15th birthday in juvie.

664
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,429
My birthday cake was
four lit matches and a Twinkie.

665
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,439
Oh, my God. How awful!

666
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,399
Okay, everyone. We are assembled tonight
to welcome our newest Diva.

667
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,592
Haley Robinson.

668
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,069
Stand up.

669
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,395
This necklace is a commitment.

670
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,753
A commitment to your life as an artist.

671
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,031
That you will never give up
on your friends or your art.

672
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,277
- Do you accept?
- I do.

673
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,119
Turn around.

674
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,554
Done.

675
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,959
Congratulations. You're a Diva.

676
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,514
Jasmine? Where is your necklace?

677
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,472
I'm getting the clasp fixed.

678
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,795
Welcome to the Divas.

679
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,960
"The Inaugural Class Music Box."

680
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,632
Yeah, the first graduating class
gifted it to the school.

681
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,432
You open it, it'd play the school song.

682
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,393
Not really worth much,
but it's sentimental.

683
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,556
Well, I can't imagine
why anyone would want to steal it.

684
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,271
Unless it had something valuable inside.

685
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,590
I doubt it. It's been there for so long.

686
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,199
But between you, me and the Kool,

687
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,869
I think the girls lifted it.

688
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,069
You sure?

689
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,395
Look, the other night,
I'm wiping down the reference room,

690
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,988
I hear the girls sneaking in, giggling.

691
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,034
I look in there, they peaced out.

692
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,957
And so is the music box.

693
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,952
I saw a picture of a man in your office.

694
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,909
He looked familiar.

695
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,791
My fishing buddy, Tony.

696
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,115
You probably read about it
in the newspaper.

697
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,231
- Anthony Canetti?
- That's it.

698
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,795
Yeah.

699
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,271
He just left here a couple days ago
for our monthly poker game.

700
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,799
It's a damn shame.

701
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,835
These bobby pins don't stay put.

702
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,068
Look here, Big Momma, I got a couple
St. Ides on ice back at the crib.

703
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,192
No. No, Big Momma's
a wine cooler woman.

704
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,718
And she has to get back to her girls.

705
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,711
Even a momma bear needs some sugar.

706
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,195
I said that's enough, now.

707
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,071
God, I forgive you for the '90s.

708
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,711
But thank you, Jesus, for now!

709
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,233
Fashion show!

710
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,628
Wanna try? This will look good.

711
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,674
How entertaining.

712
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,958
Everybody back to their rooms, now!

713
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,758
And by the way,

714
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,873
until the thief who stole that music box
comes forward,

715
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,555
lights out time, 8:00 p.m.

716
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:45,989
Bounce!

717
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,636
Don't look with the sour faces. Let's go!

718
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,239
Don't you eyeball me, girl.

719
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,959
You just go on.

720
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,474
Don't corner-eye me!

721
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,429
We was bouncing it out.

722
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,790
You was bouncing it...

723
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,877
"Ten Ways to Snag a Guy"?
That'll never work.

724
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,272
What's wrong with you? I told you
to stay away from those girls.

725
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,878
I was doing some undercover work.
Getting information.

726
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,115
Undercover. Yeah, well,
that explains you lounging in lingerie.

727
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,951
I was doing what girls do, okay?

728
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,675
Look, you gotta see the genius of my plan.

729
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,477
- Your plan?
- Yeah.

730
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,830
These girls, they're starting to think
I'm on their side.

731
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,633
- Right.
- The Divas are never gonna talk to you.

732
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,513
Not the way you run the house. Look.

733
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,191
You think the Jackson 5 gave
Papa Joe information? No.

734
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,790
Janet had all the dirt. And I'm their Janet!

735
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,395
Wait. Who the hell are the Divas?

736
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,113
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

737
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,149
The most popular girls in school!

738
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,316
They're the best artists.
They run this place.

739
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,793
You need me.

740
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,151
Trust me, I'm a seasoned FBI agent.

741
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:04,156
I've infiltrated tougher circles
than a posse of gossipy teenage girls.

742
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:09,117
So how about you stick to the hiding
and I'll stick to the undercover work?

743
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,839
Whatever.

744
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,754
I was just trying to help.

745
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,394
Please, do me a favor. Don't help.

746
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,909
Whatever!

747
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,709
Where'd you find Jasmine's necklace?

748
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,588
How'd you know this was Jasmine's?

749
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,034
You don't need me.

750
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,630
You've infiltrated tougher circles
than a posse of gossipy teenage girls.

751
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,112
Okay, fine.

752
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,113
I might be able to use your help.

753
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,278
If I help you, you got to help me.

754
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,234
- Help you what?
- You've got to sign my contract.

755
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,872
How about I think about it?

756
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,714
How about I go back to reading my Cosmo?

757
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,389
Fine.

758
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,795
Fine.

759
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,279
Nothing.

760
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,551
Just hundreds of these.

761
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,549
Not bad.

762
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,159
Turn it off, you idiot.

763
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,755
Let's go.

764
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,032
I know how to find them.

765
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,798
Charmaine, you're late for class.
Now get to ballet.

766
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,593
Demi plié.

767
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,593
Knees over the toes.

768
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,479
Chest up.

769
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,553
Shoulders back.

770
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,669
Out.

771
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,431
And grand plié!

772
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,788
And up.

773
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,395
I can't.

774
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,115
Let's get into groups for the routine.

775
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,358
Jasmine, head up.

776
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,955
Get in line!

777
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,435
Stretch.

778
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,753
Are you okay?

779
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,268
One, two, three, four, five, six...

780
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,479
Sweet Jesus.

781
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,596
Charmaine, go.

782
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,914
Go!

783
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,074
Slow down.

784
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,835
Watch out!

785
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,357
Now I know why they call it
The Nutcracker.

786
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,753
I was twirling.

787
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,472
- Have you seen this guy?
- No.

788
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,239
I'm looking for this Prodi-G.
Have you seen him?

789
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,350
I'm a record producer.
I'm very interested in talking to him.

790
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,758
For realsie? You're standing before his DJ!

791
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,231
Yeah, and I'm his business partner.

792
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,429
You're not his partner.

793
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,879
- You're his hype man.
- Whatever.

794
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,549
Have you seen him?

795
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,115
MIA since Sunday.

796
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,911
The Prodi-G, he's been known
to go on personal retreats

797
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,393
to exorcise his demons.

798
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,268
Let me give you my card.

799
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,678
If you see him, call me.

800
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,712
Maybe we can all do business.

801
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:09,198
Most definitely! Business sounds good,
baby. Take care now.

802
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,117
Let me see that card.

803
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,031
So, tell me once again.
Why do I have to go to art?

804
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,277
Because you're a student here
and you need to keep up your cover.

805
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,595
- This ain't even my type of art.
- Shut up!

806
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,718
You must be our new student, Charmaine.

807
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,269
- Hey!
- Just in time for figure day.

808
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,798
Here's our nude model!

809
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,912
Now, you just disrobe
whenever you feel comfortable.

810
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,511
Now that's my type of art!

811
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:45,268
No, no! Ain't nobody getting naked!

812
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,669
That'd be shameful.

813
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,316
What on earth do you mean, Big Momma?
This is a fine art class.

814
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,877
We're studying the human form.

815
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,833
Yep. That's right, Big Momma.
This is fine art.

816
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,157
And she is mighty fine.

817
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,036
And besides, we're all women here.

818
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,350
Well, of course. I know that.

819
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,716
But what you're doing, you know,
with this woman getting naked...

820
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,434
What you're doing is you're reinforcing

821
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,630
a terrible stereotype.

822
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,157
Yeah,

823
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:21,068
92.6% of the females in this country

824
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,918
are size 12 or bigger!

825
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,232
- Really?
- Yeah!

826
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,829
What with the media images

827
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,713
telling girls that they won't be happy
unless they're a size negative zero,

828
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,639
well, that just distorts our body image!

829
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,753
And causes eating disorders.

830
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,758
And alopecia.

831
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,109
Yeah.

832
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,310
And no offense, young lady,

833
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,315
but you got a little body
and a big-ass head! Yeah.

834
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,431
The circumference on that thing is like...

835
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,630
Don't listen to her!

836
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,752
She's having hot flashes.
Go ahead, girl, show us what you got!

837
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,519
- Wait.
- No.

838
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,468
You know,

839
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,429
I think I agree with Big Momma.

840
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,834
- You do?
- Yes.

841
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,237
We have never once had
a full-figured model.

842
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,914
It's shameful.

843
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,477
- Shameful!
- So how about it, Big Momma?

844
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,877
- Excuse me?
- I think you should be our model.

845
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,474
Amen!

846
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,670
Yeah, it's all clear in here.

847
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,597
Pipes are great.

848
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,358
I think you should be our model.

849
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,119
Big Momma don't be getting butt naked
for nobody!

850
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,276
- Come on. You're beautiful!
- No, I don't get down like that.

851
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,868
I know I'm beautiful,
but I don't get down like that.

852
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,035
No.

853
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,152
I need more pastels.

854
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,631
I need a huge canvas.

855
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,875
Excuse me, but shouldn't I
be eating some grapes,

856
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,752
or a cheeseburger or something?

857
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,997
You are an inspiration just as you are.

858
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,555
Okay. Class.

859
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:17,028
It's time for a new pose.
Artists, grab a new canvas.

860
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,475
Big Momma?

861
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,477
Okay. Well...

862
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,472
How about that one right there?

863
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,919
Very good.

864
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,037
Now, if you'd kindly just drop the sheet.

865
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,956
- Say what?
- Don't be shy.

866
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:33,639
Like you said, these girls need role models.

867
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,593
Well, I got a lot of rolls,
but they're not exactly the kind...

868
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,359
Come on, Big Momma, let it all hang out!

869
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,789
You don't want it to all hang out!

870
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,593
Show us what a real woman looks like!

871
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,832
Hurry up, it's a fire!

872
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,313
Get out of here! It's a fire!

873
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,795
Girl, your hair's gonna crimp up
if it catches on fire.

874
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:56,229
Yeah, I'm gonna let the students
and staff know the status.

875
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:01,354
False alarm, ladies!
Back to class, back to class!

876
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,959
Hello,

877
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,396
Big Momma!

878
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,350
Wrapped in that sheet,
you look like Aphrodite.

879
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,311
More like the centerfold
for Thick and Juicy.

880
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,793
Kurtis Kool,
meet my great-niece, Charmaine.

881
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,190
- How you doing, Charmaine?
- A little tip about Big Momma.

882
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,117
The more she resists,
the more she wants you.

883
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,354
With those Beyoncé thighs
and the Rihanna eyes!

884
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,392
- Get it?
- Big Momma! Big Momma!

885
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,717
It's Mia. She's saying
she's going to kill herself.

886
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,831
What you talking? That's terrible!

887
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,236
- I've got to get dressed.
- Hurry!

888
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,149
Beautiful thing.

889
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,115
Boom shaka-laka-laka! Boom shaka-laka!

890
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,879
It's Kurtis. I'm out front.

891
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,035
Charmaine!

892
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,550
- You have a free period?
- I do now.

893
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,672
- Good. Come shopping with me.
- Okay. All right.

894
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,790
All right, all right. I had to get dressed!
What is all this...

895
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,719
Blood! Did anyone call 911?

896
00:53:58,880 --> 00:53:59,949
Mia?

897
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,399
Oh, my God.

898
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,592
You told me she was going to kill herself.

899
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,473
- I want to die!
- You have too much to live for.

900
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,636
Calm down.
Tell Big Momma what happened.

901
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:14,553
We bought hair dye at Walgreens
and the directions were in Spanish.

902
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,999
She takes French.

903
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,351
Child, don't you know cheap hair dye
is like an old man?

904
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,869
It don't last long
and marks up the furniture.

905
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,356
I thought if I looked different,
Delanté would fall back in love with me.

906
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,993
You look different, all right.

907
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,589
But now, listen.

908
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,393
He has got to love you for all the stuff
you can't buy in no store.

909
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,589
And if he don't,

910
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,758
then don't change yourself,
change your man.

911
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,952
Huh? We feeling the deepness?

912
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,913
Huh? Think about that.

913
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:44,993
What about my hair?

914
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,633
Well, that's got to go.

915
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,671
Yeah, we're gonna wash that fella
right out of your hair.

916
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:55,834
Ew, not that.

917
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,393
Definitely not that!

918
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,389
This.

919
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,472
I'm not sure that's me. You know?

920
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,636
I know what's you. Trust me.

921
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,597
All right, girl. You want this one?

922
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,234
What do you mean? We're sharing.

923
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,114
What are you waiting for?
Take your clothes off.

924
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,830
Girl, something just came up!
I'll be right back.

925
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,593
I'll be right back!

926
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,755
- Are you okay?
- I'm all right!

927
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:51,197
Ain't nothing feel better than washing
a bad man out of your hair.

928
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:54,909
My own Big Momma used to mix up
sulfur blue with industrial cleanser.

929
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,154
There we go.

930
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,828
Vaseline?

931
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,598
God's gift to black people.

932
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:07,989
Ashy coming out of the bathtub?
Baby's got a diaper rash?

933
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,076
Your hair look like it just took a mug shot?

934
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,553
Just rub it in!

935
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,758
There. Watch me work my magic now.

936
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,479
Voilà!

937
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,878
There you go.

938
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,434
You're a genius! Thank you!

939
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,598
I just brought the beauty outside.

940
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:37,838
Come over here for a second
and let Big Momma get a talk with you.

941
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,395
Tell me what you know about
the missing music box.

942
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,553
You didn't hear this from me,
but Jasmine and Isabelle,

943
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,237
I heard them say they're meeting someone
near the library tonight.

944
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,157
- With what?
- I don't know.

945
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,191
But I hear them say that
Isabelle's gonna bring it in her bag.

946
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,070
You look awesome, girl.

947
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,477
Back at you, H-bomb.

948
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,309
Yo, Robinson.

949
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,275
Delanté.

950
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,072
- Looking fine, Haley.
- Yes, she is.

951
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,519
How about we hang out
after your big show?

952
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:20,959
You just broke up with Mia.

953
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,679
Help me heal.

954
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,708
Come on.

955
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,078
IM me if you change your mind.

956
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,389
Those guys are such tools.

957
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,189
So, you got, like, a boyfriend or anything?

958
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,673
No way.

959
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:41,679
I'm beginning to think the guy
I'm looking for doesn't really exist.

960
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,949
How about you?

961
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,433
No, girl.

962
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,949
The guy for me definitely does not exist.

963
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:51,272
You know what? I think I got somebody
I could hook you up with, girl.

964
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,628
- Really?
- Yep.

965
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,239
- Who?
- He's my cousin.

966
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:57,670
His name is Trent. Hottie. Buff. Right?

967
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:01,033
He's our age. Plus, he's like
a hip-hop lyrical miracle.

968
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,913
You've probably seen him perform at the
Promenade. He goes by the name of...

969
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,632
- The Prodi-G?
- Yeah, yeah!

970
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,479
- Yeah, yeah!
- Thinks he's all that and then some?

971
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,033
Talks about himself in the third person

972
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,277
and thinks that every girl
on the planet is after him?

973
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:17,796
No offense, Charmaine, but your cousin
is the last guy I'd ever hook up with.

974
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,679
Ew, the Prodi-G.

975
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,389
So,

976
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,439
what is your type?

977
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,519
He's artistic.

978
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:37,156
Sensitive. Interested in people
besides himself.

979
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,878
And he likes long,

980
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,789
sweet, slow, lingering kisses.

981
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:46,875
Damn.

982
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:48,708
Damn!

983
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,037
What? Are you making fun of me?

984
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,550
No, girl.
No, I'm saying that's exactly Trent.

985
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,470
Sure, he can be all puffed up
on the outside,

986
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,909
but once you get to know him,
I'm saying, he's a real sweetheart.

987
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,353
I mean, you guys should, like, be a couple!

988
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,238
He was thinking of going
to the Showcase tomorrow.

989
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:09,114
Maybe you guys can hook up, you know,
after the dance. Tomorrow night.

990
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:10,719
I don't know. Can I meet him before?

991
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:13,354
No! It's tomorrow night.

992
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,432
Well, how about tonight, then?

993
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,835
He'll be there.

994
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,555
Good.

995
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,678
Just Kurtis Kool.

996
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,592
Let me see.

997
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,472
What is wrong with you?
Your life's in danger

998
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,079
and what did you do? You go shopping.

999
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,550
Look, shopping is a very big deal for girls.

1000
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:38,474
It's like their sports. If they ain't
doing it, they're talking about it.

1001
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,070
Comparing stats, tracking sales.
It's like a fantasy league, you know?

1002
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,828
So help me, Trent,
if you're falling for that Haley girl...

1003
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,349
I'm not going for Haley.
I mean... No.

1004
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:49,710
- She's not my type.
- Good.

1005
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:56,153
Okay, so, why don't we just
go down there and intercept it?

1006
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,749
Not yet.
Surveillance is a waiting game.

1007
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,836
We can't do anything
that could blow our cover.

1008
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:05,112
Besides, if Mia is spinning us, let's
just hope that if it is the music box,

1009
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,117
that the flash drive's still inside it.

1010
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,753
Okay.

1011
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,873
So we just wait here.

1012
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,593
Wait a minute. Is that the Tempts?

1013
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,032
Not too old school for you?

1014
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,515
No, actually, I was thinking about
sampling it for my mix tape.

1015
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,239
Can you sing it?

1016
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,279
I'd rather hum.

1017
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:34,188
I mean, but if you sing it, I can catch
a vibe and I can have a dope mix tape

1018
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:37,318
with some old-school jams on there.
Then we can like...

1019
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,793
All right.

1020
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,839
Papa was a rolling stone

1021
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:46,318
- Wherever he laid his hat was his home
- What

1022
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,955
And I'm so fly
But I get it from my fam

1023
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:54,153
And we in the place and we on a case
Vibin' out to an old-school jam

1024
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,474
I like that.

1025
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:00,912
I like how you put the little new school
with the old school. I could feel that.

1026
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,316
I could jam to that. I could, you know,
do this little thing I do.

1027
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,873
Now, what's that?

1028
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,998
A little something I used to do back
in the day called the Cleveland Shuffle.

1029
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,712
No, I need that. Come on.

1030
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,990
- Well, it's two to the right.
- Okay.

1031
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,509
Two to the left. Now freak with it.

1032
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,792
Freak with it.
Freak with it, freak with it.

1033
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,032
Kick. Now you get your spin on. Right?

1034
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,873
Right? Bring it back.

1035
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,917
Then you freak with it.

1036
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,792
Freak with it. That's right.

1037
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,434
And your arms got to be
in a little T. Rex position.

1038
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,198
- Okay.
- So a little something...

1039
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,754
- Now freak with it.
- So it's like the Soulja Boy, right?

1040
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:37,992
No, Soulja Boy,
that's a little hop thing.

1041
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,917
I know what you're talking about,
but that's a little hop thing.

1042
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:41,598
- This is...
- This is more like this?

1043
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,756
This is Tempts. When them boys was...

1044
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,472
- I like that.
- You know...

1045
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:49,309
You know, that kind of thing.
That's why I like doing this move.

1046
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,635
'Cause it's not that complicated.

1047
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:57,989
Wait, what's up?

1048
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,636
There are the girls. All right.

1049
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,271
Chirkoff must have gotten to Kurtis Kool

1050
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,356
and Kurtis Kool got the girls
to steal the music box.

1051
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:06,709
I can't believe that.

1052
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:09,638
Look, Trent.
Get back in that dress, all right?

1053
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,830
- I'm gonna check it out.
- Okay.

1054
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:50,795
Boo.

1055
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,036
Wow, a security guard with stalkers.

1056
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,358
I'm a curious woman.

1057
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,393
Why don't you come
and throw back some juice with me?

1058
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,431
Let me satisfy that curiosity.

1059
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,435
Well, all right. A little juice.

1060
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,592
This way?

1061
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,679
Hey, have you seen a girl...

1062
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,518
Okay. Thank you.

1063
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,035
Haley?

1064
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,155
Trent?

1065
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,518
What's up? How you doing?

1066
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:51,111
I'm so sorry I'm late.
These poetry readings always run long.

1067
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:54,996
- You do spoken word?
- Yeah.

1068
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:00,195
And I like slow, lingering kisses.

1069
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,238
You know, it's weird
that you would say that.

1070
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,908
Yeah, 'cause you feel the same way,
too, right?

1071
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,677
No, it's just weird
that you would say that.

1072
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:16,677
Right, right. Because rap don't allow me
to get my sensitivities out.

1073
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,796
And I got a lot of sensitivities

1074
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,912
I like to get out.
As a man, it's like...

1075
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,476
They're deep.
It's like an ocean inside me.

1076
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,310
At the poetry jam,

1077
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,431
we get all our sensitivities out,
you know what I'm saying?

1078
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,389
- And we be snapping...
- Okay.

1079
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:36,080
And it's like... It's...

1080
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,754
You know, I'm really sorry all
Charmaine's coaching had to go to waste,

1081
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,029
but I think that I'm just going to go.

1082
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,116
No, no, no, wait, just stay. Stay.

1083
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,754
Look.

1084
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:47,356
Charmaine told me you were
a beautiful, great girl.

1085
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:50,916
And usually, beautiful, great girls
don't go for...

1086
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,075
The Prodi-G?

1087
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:55,432
Yeah. Well, that's not exactly who I am.

1088
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,109
This isn't who I am. This is...

1089
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:05,429
Okay, then, who are you?

1090
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:10,435
I don't know. I don't know who I am.

1091
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:12,790
I'm still trying to figure that out.

1092
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:15,715
Me, too.

1093
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,356
Yeah. Can we run this back?

1094
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,279
Yes. Yes, we can.

1095
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:21,794
I'm Trent.

1096
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:23,999
- Haley.
- Haley.

1097
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,192
Your champagne, my Nubian goddess.

1098
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:34,316
Now don't go putting me on no pedestal.
You know it might break.

1099
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:37,796
What you talking about, girl?
I like a woman with a little

1100
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,638
funk in her trunk!

1101
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,950
And some shrimp in the backyard.
That's a woman!

1102
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,630
Well, I like me a man
with a dangerous side.

1103
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,430
Something tells me
that Kurtis Kool is not just a man

1104
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:53,154
with keys and a Taser, huh?

1105
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:54,759
And you're ticklish!

1106
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:01,191
Well, I'm into some illegalities
at the moment.

1107
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,918
Well, what kind?

1108
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:05,834
Well, just typical BS, you know.

1109
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,518
Middleman stuff.

1110
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:11,396
Holding something hot.

1111
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,119
That's "stolen."

1112
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:16,994
Who you holding it for?

1113
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,395
What are you, the FBI?

1114
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:22,311
No! Ain't no FBI!

1115
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:24,193
You wearing a wire?

1116
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:26,636
- What? No!
- I'm going to find the wire!

1117
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,632
- Can you hear this?
- No...

1118
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:32,799
Now that's funny,
'cause I know I ain't no FBI.

1119
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,029
This I know.

1120
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,238
You're so beautiful.

1121
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,713
So much I like you.

1122
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,434
You know,

1123
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,712
you're my high priestess of delight.

1124
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:52,115
No, no... Kurtis Kool!

1125
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,037
- I just want to bite you!
- Kurtis!

1126
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:00,153
You got Motownopoly. Let's play.

1127
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:02,149
Yeah.

1128
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,193
I got a better game than that.

1129
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,394
So, look, I should get back.

1130
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,958
Really? Why?

1131
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:20,073
I guess I got a little time.

1132
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,231
- Damn!
- Damn!

1133
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,319
Yo! It's Trent!

1134
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:27,791
Yo, you got the producer guy's number?

1135
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,592
Yo, call him
and tell him we found our boy.

1136
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,073
What's he doing?

1137
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,155
Yeah. Yeah, we found our boy!

1138
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,110
Trent! Yo!

1139
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:51,636
Whoa! Rembrandt. Wow.

1140
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:54,273
Yeah. This is my crew.

1141
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,755
- This is Rembrandt and Scratch.
- Hey.

1142
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,199
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

1143
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,276
Yo, you got your step-pop
to sign the contract yet?

1144
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,799
Yeah, man, I'm on it.

1145
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,388
- Come on, I want to take you somewhere.
- Okay.

1146
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,792
- See you guys later.
- See you guys.

1147
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:08,751
- All right.
- Yeah, you do that!

1148
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,832
'Cause we got somebody
we want you to meet.

1149
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,679
- Yeah, I'll holler. Okay.
- Yeah, yeah! Tomorrow, Trent!

1150
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:17,789
Scratch and Rembrandt, they're like,
I don't know, one's tall, one's short.

1151
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,515
Yeah, I noticed that.

1152
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:22,509
We found him.

1153
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,871
Just stay with him.
See if he leads you to the father.

1154
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:26,989
Okay.

1155
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:34,754
Let the games begin.

1156
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,995
You know, these girls of mine
are driving me up a wall.

1157
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,795
You know Jasmine Lee
and Isabelle Parada?

1158
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,117
No, refresh my memory.

1159
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:45,879
Left foot, red.

1160
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,715
They gave you a bag about an hour ago.

1161
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,911
Right foot, yellow.

1162
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:01,516
That Jasmine and Isabelle.

1163
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,109
Sorry, Big Momma.

1164
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:08,348
You know, those girls could be in
a lot of trouble. And so could you.

1165
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:12,995
So who you holding that bag for?
Someone outside the school?

1166
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,034
You really want to see that bag?

1167
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:16,715
Damn!

1168
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,678
Right hand, blue.

1169
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:22,559
Are you...

1170
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:24,674
Is it blue?

1171
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:25,915
Right hand, blue.

1172
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:34,113
Come to papa.

1173
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,198
Left hand, green!

1174
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:55,509
Well...

1175
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:58,553
Looks like we're all out of green.
Game over.

1176
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:01,792
No, no, no. I got your green.

1177
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:08,029
Okay. Go ahead.
Reach for the stars, baby.

1178
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:09,395
Hell, no!

1179
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,755
What's wrong with your voice?

1180
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,480
You heard me. Get your ass up.

1181
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:18,629
Sister, you a brother?

1182
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:22,389
Not again.

1183
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,599
You touch me again,
I'll knock you into next Sunday.

1184
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,559
Hand over the bag.
Hand over the bag, now!

1185
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,918
Every time I try to meet somebody,
it's ding-a-ling-a-ling!

1186
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:35,439
Be quiet! All right?

1187
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:38,917
I'm undercover. FBI.
Now give me the damn bag.

1188
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,477
Wow.

1189
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,389
What the hell?

1190
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,438
What the hell is a grown man doing
with a damn rooster?

1191
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,230
The girls stole it from St. Ignatius.

1192
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,598
The boys' school? They're the Gamecocks.

1193
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:08,832
They were gonna give it back
after the Showcase.

1194
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,079
You want to finish the game?

1195
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,395
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

1196
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,272
- You'll see.
- Okay.

1197
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,149
Wow.

1198
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,557
It's my home away from home.

1199
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,192
- This is nice.
- Tomorrow night's the Showcase

1200
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,788
and it's my best shot at getting
a scholarship for composition.

1201
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:42,076
Without a scholarship, I'm out.

1202
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:47,314
Everyone is gonna be there, you know?
Juilliard, Berklee, Peabody and Oberlin.

1203
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:50,200
All right, look. Okay.
So, I see a beautiful woman right now.

1204
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,192
I see a dope piano.

1205
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,550
And nobody's playing it.

1206
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:57,034
You want me to play?

1207
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,832
- Yeah.
- Right now.

1208
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,158
All right, I guess I'll play it.

1209
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:03,395
No, no, don't touch my piano.

1210
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,751
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

1211
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,234
Okay, please don't judge. It's rough.

1212
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:30,152
See? It's not totally there yet.
I don't know, something's missing.

1213
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:32,430
No, it's not missing nothing.
It's tight.

1214
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,790
You just got to feel it,
you know what I mean?

1215
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:37,559
You just got to, like, speed it up a little bit.

1216
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:39,033
- Speed it up?
- Yeah.

1217
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,113
Okay.

1218
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:45,835
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1219
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,598
- That's better, right?
- Yeah.

1220
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:01,838
You've given me everything

1221
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,793
You make me complete

1222
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:17,595
- Yeah, I like that, I like that.
- You like that?

1223
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:19,312
Should we syncopate it?

1224
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:22,398
Look, normally, I don't
syncopate on the first date, but...

1225
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:38,393
All right, this is
what we're gonna do next, right?

1226
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,516
You're gonna go up a little higher.
You know what I mean?

1227
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,272
Up an octave?

1228
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:43,998
Yeah, an octave.

1229
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,836
Baby, you know

1230
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:03,513
You are the air that I breathe

1231
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,560
The life that's in me

1232
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:13,034
Me and you, we chillin'
Hangin', cruisin'

1233
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:16,312
Me and you together ain't worth losin'

1234
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:19,029
On the keys, being crazy

1235
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:21,475
Happy that I get to see you daily

1236
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,830
Each time I see you

1237
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:26,708
My heart starts to pound

1238
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:32,035
Whenever you come around

1239
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:36,388
'Cause you are all I need

1240
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,348
You've given me everything

1241
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,790
You make me complete

1242
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:48,796
Yeah, you are all I need

1243
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:53,233
You're making me better, see

1244
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:57,718
All of the love that you're giving me

1245
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:07,113
- How did you... That song is amazing.
- It's perfect, right?

1246
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:09,674
We have to do it
at the Showcase tomorrow night.

1247
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:10,869
We?

1248
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,195
Yeah, we'll blow everyone away!

1249
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:16,040
I mean, you know, it's your show.
I'll be watching.

1250
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:19,835
No, come on, you're a part of this.
I can't do it without you.

1251
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:21,875
Please?

1252
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:24,193
- What time?
- Really?

1253
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,119
Thank you!

1254
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,549
I have to go back to the dorms
before I get in trouble.

1255
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:38,755
Yo.

1256
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:41,673
Let's break night.

1257
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,718
- "Break night."
- Yeah.

1258
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,034
I love that.

1259
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:47,913
You're so amazing with words.

1260
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,079
I can't believe you don't want to go
to college.

1261
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:53,477
I mean, all of those writers and poets
you could study.

1262
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:56,355
You know, I just figured I got to strike
while the iron's hot.

1263
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:59,514
Jay-Z didn't drop Reasonable Doubt
until he was 27.

1264
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:04,033
Said the world's in a rush,
but he waited to be perfect.

1265
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:08,589
Well,

1266
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,311
I'm feeling pretty perfect right now.

1267
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,069
Me, too.

1268
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,313
I have curfew.

1269
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:37,916
- See you tomorrow night?
- Yeah.

1270
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,758
Yeah, tomorrow night!

1271
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:53,270
Kid's here to see his girlfriend,
not his father.

1272
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:56,073
Then take him. We'll kill him later.

1273
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:57,749
Right now, he's bait.

1274
01:16:58,520 --> 01:16:59,589
Okay.

1275
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:01,873
Let's go get him.

1276
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,153
Let's go. Come on.

1277
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:23,196
Two girls in one night.

1278
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:24,833
You got to give the kid credit.

1279
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:31,679
Not so much.

1280
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,630
You idiots! How could you lose him?

1281
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:53,909
I don't know.
But I know where to find his girlfriend.

1282
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,513
Both of them.

1283
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,399
Here's the deal.

1284
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,991
You want me to keep your secret

1285
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:10,590
about kidnapping Foghorn Leghorn here,

1286
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:15,158
then tell me what you know about
the music box missing from the library.

1287
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,631
- Okay.
- That a girl.

1288
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:24,149
There's a music box in the library
and now it's missing.

1289
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:29,079
Big Momma, I have been looking for...

1290
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,150
What is the St. Ignatius mascot
doing here?

1291
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:40,756
Okay, I'm going to give you
to the count of three.

1292
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:44,350
And if nobody speaks up, then
neither of you is going to the Showcase.

1293
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:46,915
One.

1294
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:49,955
Two.

1295
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:53,838
They didn't steal the bird!

1296
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:55,875
They found it.

1297
01:18:56,200 --> 01:19:00,034
Yeah, it was wandering around the quad
and they brought it to me.

1298
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,235
Well...

1299
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:05,829
Thank you, girls.

1300
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:08,956
There go one of my flock
in need of some counseling.

1301
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:12,198
Listen. I suggest
you get this bird back to St. Ignatius

1302
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:13,912
before it lays any more eggs.

1303
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:15,749
But it's a rooster.

1304
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:19,749
Child, they all taste the same
when you preheat the oven to 350.

1305
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:20,949
Try it!

1306
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,035
You!

1307
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:31,075
Stop!

1308
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,477
Come here! Come here!

1309
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:39,029
Come here!

1310
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:43,114
I know that I've left you
a couple of other voice mails.

1311
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:44,719
You can ignore those.

1312
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:49,198
- I can call you back.
- Drive!

1313
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:51,788
I can't! Delanté used to
drive me everywhere! I barely know...

1314
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,354
Child, I told you, you don't need
no damn Delanté! Now, drive!

1315
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,149
Turn!

1316
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,755
- I almost hit him!
- Almost don't count.

1317
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:17,432
Now take it up to 80.

1318
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,677
- Eighty?
- You heard me! Eighty!

1319
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:25,715
Great. I'm being followed
by a fat lady in a driver's ed car!

1320
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:26,795
She's catching up.

1321
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:33,799
Turn here!

1322
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:41,997
Over there! I'm going to pull
the emergency brake.

1323
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:51,152
This little go-kart handles well.

1324
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:52,668
Keep driving! Go!

1325
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:56,393
- Now don't slow down.
- You're going to kill us!

1326
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:58,192
Without Delanté,
you got nothing to live for.

1327
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,788
No, I do!
I have friends and I have school...

1328
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,678
That was amazing!

1329
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:08,029
Watch out!

1330
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,315
- What do we do?
- Pray for the airbags.

1331
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,635
I can do this!

1332
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,515
Well, I think you learned enough
for one day. I'll drive.

1333
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:31,111
They were here.
I gotta believe they're coming back.

1334
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:32,389
They're going to kill me.

1335
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:36,390
You've never taken off that dress.
How would they know you were here?

1336
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:39,760
They wouldn't. But if they did.

1337
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:44,353
Trent, is there something
you want to tell me?

1338
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:48,429
No.

1339
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,471
Now, listen. Get back in costume.

1340
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:53,160
Do not get out of it
under any circumstances.

1341
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:54,839
- All right?
- All right.

1342
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,279
Hey. Don't worry.

1343
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:03,111
I'll find it when everyone's
at the Showcase tonight.

1344
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:06,191
Okay? All right.

1345
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,350
You guys have to see.

1346
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:17,797
Isabelle, it's great. You really captured her.

1347
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:20,354
Yeah, girl,
and there's a whole lot to capture.

1348
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:23,392
Thanks. I just hope the RISD
admissions people agree.

1349
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:24,669
Yeah, they totally will.

1350
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,999
Hey, have you heard from Trent?
He better be here soon.

1351
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,634
- Big Momma?
- Yes, dear?

1352
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:40,749
You knew I took the rooster
and you didn't narc me out.

1353
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:44,716
Child, this is not Big Momma's
first barbecue.

1354
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:47,035
You putting on this front of toughness.

1355
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:49,431
Trying to act all growed up.

1356
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:50,959
I'm a senior.

1357
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:53,310
Child, I see who you are on the inside.

1358
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:56,591
You're a good, sensitive girl.
No different than Big Momma.

1359
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,632
You're strong-willed,

1360
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:01,718
just trying to take care of the people
who depend on you.

1361
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:04,109
Plus

1362
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:06,873
I'm starving!

1363
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:10,349
The poor baby is hungry!

1364
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:16,149
I did something else.

1365
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:18,833
Worse than the rooster.

1366
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,359
She wanted to be a Diva so bad,

1367
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:23,040
I told her she could be
if she stole the music box.

1368
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:26,074
- Who?
- Haley. I made her do it.

1369
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,511
I told her to bring it tonight
so that we could put it back.

1370
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:31,799
- Where is Haley?
- I just saw her with Mia.

1371
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:36,752
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to our annual Showcase!

1372
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:41,110
Get ready to see some of the best

1373
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:43,196
and brightest young talent
that Atlanta has to offer.

1374
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,390
Well, thank you for telling me, all right?

1375
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,238
That was big of you, you know?

1376
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:50,557
Now get out there and break a leg,
and make Big Momma proud.

1377
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,673
And afterward, I'm going to have
a double cheeseburger

1378
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:57,399
and a regular Coke.

1379
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,999
Supersize it!

1380
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:01,236
...Jasmine Lee!

1381
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:03,954
Now go, go! Go, go, go!

1382
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,351
How many times do I gotta say I'm sorry?

1383
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,034
Sorry?

1384
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:23,317
"Sorry" don't mean squat
from a two-timing dog!

1385
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,352
Like Aunt Yorima used to say,

1386
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:28,916
"It's better to be alone with yourself
for the rest of your life

1387
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:31,316
"than together with bad company
for a minute."

1388
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,556
And, honey, you is bad company!

1389
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:37,116
You're an entire conglomerate of badness!

1390
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:39,390
Wait. Who is Aunt Yorima?

1391
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,116
Mia? You seen Haley?

1392
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:45,915
Yeah. I think she's with Charmaine.
Try the other side of the stage.

1393
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,438
- This Delanté?
- Yeah.

1394
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:52,995
And another thing...

1395
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:58,351
Hey, Haley. Hey, girl.

1396
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,277
Where is Trent? I'm up next!

1397
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:01,799
Excuse me.

1398
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,751
Listen, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

1399
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,233
Trent's not going to make it.

1400
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:13,556
What? What am I going to do?

1401
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,676
Bravo! You did your thing.
I saw that move.

1402
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,593
All right, listen. Breathe, girl, breathe.
It's all good.

1403
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:28,597
You're going to go out there
and you're gonna be great.

1404
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:29,955
You don't need Trent.

1405
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:33,709
Next, with an original composition,
Haley Robinson!

1406
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:35,475
Okay.

1407
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,992
Big Momma, what are you doing?
You're supposed to be chaperoning!

1408
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:48,235
There are boys backstage.

1409
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:52,874
All right, all right.

1410
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,752
Hey! What are you... Get out of there, you!

1411
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:58,190
You don't try to get a little nookie!
I'm gonna tan your hide!

1412
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,672
Okay.

1413
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:29,111
I'm sorry, this was supposed to be a duet.

1414
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,314
It still is, girl.
Look, Trent taught me everything.

1415
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:39,078
- What?
- Rock with it.

1416
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,675
Baby, you know

1417
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:58,192
You are the air that I breathe

1418
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,869
The life that's in me

1419
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,150
Oh

1420
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,959
And each time I see you

1421
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:09,714
My heart starts to pound

1422
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:14,995
Whenever you come around

1423
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:19,872
'Cause you are all I need

1424
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,480
You're making me better, see

1425
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:26,352
From all of the love

1426
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,152
That you're giving me
Every time I think about you

1427
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:30,396
Want you, need you, hold you
Kiss you, love you

1428
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:33,353
Never would place a person
on this earth above you

1429
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:37,109
I just want to be the one
to make you feel amazing

1430
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:39,276
And because you keep it real
We singing

1431
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:41,391
And each time I see you

1432
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,753
My heart starts to pound

1433
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:50,159
Whenever you come around

1434
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:54,239
Yeah, you are all I need

1435
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:55,998
You gentlemen...

1436
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:57,678
Are you invited guests?

1437
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:00,430
That's the crazy lady who chased us.

1438
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:02,716
Get out of our way. We have business here.

1439
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:04,637
Only business you have here is none-ya.

1440
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:06,993
What? "None-ya"?

1441
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,550
None-ya damn business!

1442
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:12,433
I crossed the line
I'm wrong to lie

1443
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:13,834
I'll make you mine

1444
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:18,033
Yeah, you are all I need

1445
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:19,708
Wait

1446
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:22,434
These words I'm speaking
got me going crazy

1447
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:23,993
I need you, Haley

1448
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:25,872
To be my baby

1449
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:38,392
Wardrobe malfunction!

1450
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:46,439
- Haley...
- You... You're...

1451
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:47,754
- Let me explain.
- I trusted you!

1452
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:50,838
- No, listen, listen.
- My God, everything I told you?

1453
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,393
I'm just saying... Listen.

1454
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:58,275
Haley!

1455
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:03,953
Security! Security! He groped me!

1456
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:06,598
He's trying to freak me!

1457
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:09,871
He's groping me! He's trying to freak me!

1458
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:15,111
Oh, Lord!
Call the FBI, ask for Agent Crawford.

1459
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:18,597
Tell him you're a friend of Big Momma's
and keep everyone in the auditorium!

1460
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:19,709
I don't understand.

1461
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:22,035
Just do it. I'll explain it to you later.

1462
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:27,958
Okay.
Everyone, please stay in your seats, okay?

1463
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:30,036
Mrs. Mercier, dancers, please!

1464
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:35,433
Split up!

1465
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:38,989
- Haley!
- Trent! Trent!

1466
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:43,354
- Haley!
- Yo, yo, yo! What is this thing?

1467
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:45,711
Dude, you are all kinds of freaky!

1468
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,432
Does Haley like you better
as a girl or a boy?

1469
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:48,879
Look, I can't do this right now.

1470
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:51,037
Big boy! Come on, man!

1471
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:53,196
Come on, get him! Get him!

1472
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:57,357
All right. Y'all got 30 seconds
to get your asses off campus

1473
01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:59,596
or there's a hell of a lot more
where that came from.

1474
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:01,279
Bounce!

1475
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:03,599
You've got some explaining to do.

1476
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:05,597
Look, Chirkoff's guys
must've made me yesterday in town.

1477
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:08,632
I took off Charmaine's outfit just once,
to get close to Haley.

1478
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:11,194
You blew your cover.
And lied to me about it!

1479
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:13,276
- For a girl who played you?
- She didn't play me.

1480
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:16,154
Yeah? Did she tell you
she had the music box?

1481
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:21,910
You act like you're the man.
And you were starting to convince me.

1482
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:23,359
But it's all an act, you know why?

1483
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:25,994
'Cause a real man wouldn't
risk his life for some girl.

1484
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,152
Look, she ain't just some girl!

1485
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:29,872
You did the same thing
when you met my mom.

1486
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,638
This is nothing like that.

1487
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,432
Come on. Come on. Malcolm!

1488
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:34,879
- In. In!
- Yo!

1489
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:40,436
Stay there! Do not move.

1490
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:43,393
Look, you got to trust me! Malcolm!

1491
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:45,993
Damn!

1492
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:10,749
Haley! Haley!

1493
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:17,109
Haley!

1494
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:18,789
Haley!

1495
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:23,278
Boss. We got him.

1496
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:30,874
H-bomb!

1497
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,433
- Go away!
- Look, let me explain.

1498
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:33,993
Leave me alone!

1499
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:36,873
Look, you got the music box in that bag,
don't you?

1500
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,036
Yeah, and right now I just want to
put it away and get out of here,

1501
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:40,878
seeing as how my life
is pretty much ruined!

1502
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,195
Look, there's some crazy,
dangerous people after that.

1503
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:45,357
What are you talking about?
It's just some old music box.

1504
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:47,039
Not really.

1505
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:56,953
Look. This flash drive got evidence
that'd put away some really bad people.

1506
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:58,399
That's why I've been working undercover.

1507
01:31:58,880 --> 01:31:59,949
What?

1508
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:03,789
So this was just some kind of job?

1509
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:09,839
Our night together? Our kiss?

1510
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,355
We'll talk about that later.
But right now, I need this.

1511
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:13,999
- There's no later.
- Haley.

1512
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:16,076
Actually, I'll take the drive!

1513
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:19,155
Trent!

1514
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:21,114
Haley, come on!

1515
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:26,034
Run, run!

1516
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:29,189
Talk to me.

1517
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:30,912
The kid's with the girl,
they're in the library.

1518
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:32,393
Haley, we got to get you somewhere safe.

1519
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:34,317
- Let go of me!
- Come on.

1520
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:40,874
Don't move.

1521
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:43,872
Runs pretty good for a woman.

1522
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:45,992
Don't shoot.

1523
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:49,874
I'm not even wearing
a clean pair of granny panties.

1524
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:52,913
Coroner's gonna think
I'm some two-bit floozy!

1525
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:54,189
Shut up.

1526
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:00,799
My palpitations!

1527
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:02,433
My poor cholesterol heart!

1528
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:05,677
Like Fred Sanford said,
"I'm coming to join you, Elizabeth!"

1529
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:13,915
Wait, wait, wait!

1530
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:16,158
Come on. Come on!

1531
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:30,789
This way.

1532
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,638
Big Momma! Catch!

1533
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:40,233
Move. Move!

1534
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:42,551
- Haley, it's gonna be okay.
- Shut your mouth!

1535
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,716
You're just gonna hurt
these innocent children?

1536
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:48,315
- Give me the flash drive.
- What if I say no?

1537
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:50,032
I'm pretty good with this gun.

1538
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:52,037
My late husband Othar taught me
how to use it

1539
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:54,310
in case of a home invasion.

1540
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:01,630
Give him the gun, or I shoot the kids.

1541
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:10,948
Now,

1542
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,469
the flash drive.

1543
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:21,832
Very good, Agent Turner.

1544
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:25,032
It took me a while to figure out.
Then I remember.

1545
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:27,995
You're the master of disguise.

1546
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:36,954
Take off the fat suit.
I want to check you for weapons.

1547
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:45,599
Look, don't shoot the kids, all right?

1548
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:47,392
He don't remember what he saw.

1549
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:50,188
Kill them.

1550
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:52,875
And this time, no witnesses.

1551
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:54,992
- My pleasure.
- Hey, Trent.

1552
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:56,473
I'm checking the flash drive.

1553
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:59,831
I'm sorry.
I was wrong to think we could pull this off.

1554
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:01,234
This is my fault.

1555
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:03,237
No. You was just trying to protect me.

1556
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:06,631
I lied to you and everything. I'm sorry, Dad.

1557
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:11,115
All right, this family hour has to end.
I'm going to throw up.

1558
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:13,708
Hey, whoa.
Just let me say one last thing to my boy.

1559
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:19,354
You know, I'll go to my grave wishing
we could have done

1560
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:20,799
that Cleveland Shuffle together.

1561
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:22,558
Remember?

1562
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:24,193
Yeah.

1563
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:26,880
Killer step. If I just had once more chance.

1564
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,878
Remember, it'd be two to the right,

1565
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:31,837
two to the left.

1566
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:34,758
Now freak with it, freak with it.
Freak with it, freak with it.

1567
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:42,350
Enough! No more mistakes.

1568
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:45,198
I never leave a witness.

1569
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:47,275
Wait.

1570
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:56,079
My name is Kurtis Kool

1571
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:58,318
