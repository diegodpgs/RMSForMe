1
00:01:00,737 --> 00:01:02,737
You're always sick.

2
00:01:03,621 --> 00:01:05,840
You were sick
when you were my age.

3
00:01:08,328 --> 00:01:10,328
Evening, sir.

4
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:14,078
Evening, Victor.
I didn't realized that you're still here.

5
00:01:16,002 --> 00:01:19,797
I'm just keeping James company, sir.
If that's all right...

6
00:01:22,797 --> 00:01:24,797
Very kind of you.

7
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:28,802
- Are you better, son?
- Still cold, Father.

8
00:01:28,932 --> 00:01:31,400
It's just a mild fever.
You'll be all right in the morning.

9
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,069
- You always say that.
- And you always pull through, don't you?

10
00:01:37,318 --> 00:01:40,535
Now ... take your medicine.

11
00:01:41,496 --> 00:01:43,496
<i>Elizabeth !</i>

12
00:01:43,588 --> 00:01:45,116
<i>Elizabeth !</i>

13
00:01:45,117 --> 00:01:47,056
Your father's drunk again .

14
00:01:47,057 --> 00:01:48,931
You should help it home, Victor.

15
00:01:48,932 --> 00:01:51,543
It's not my name he's calling, sir.

16
00:01:52,968 --> 00:01:55,204
- Father!
- Stay where you are, James!

17
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:57,495
Father!

18
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,800
<i> I told you never to come back here!</i>

19
00:02:31,188 --> 00:02:33,168
James ...

20
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:34,748
There are things you
don't understand.

21
00:02:34,749 --> 00:02:35,949
- Don't...
- I need him them to know!

22
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:36,673
Please no!

23
00:02:36,674 --> 00:02:37,799
- No...more...lies!

24
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,800
James ...

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,700
UHNOOOO!

26
00:02:57,503 --> 00:02:59,503
James!

27
00:03:04,377 --> 00:03:07,627
He...he wasn't your father ...

28
00:03:15,626 --> 00:03:17,626
... son.

29
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:27,589
What are you?

30
00:03:42,345 --> 00:03:45,156
- I didn't mean it! I didn't...
- Yes, you did!

31
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:50,331
He deserved it!
And you give it to him.

32
00:03:52,577 --> 00:03:56,079
We're brothers, Jimmy.
You realize that?

33
00:03:56,114 --> 00:03:58,205
Brother's protect each other.

34
00:03:58,832 --> 00:04:00,409
You have to be hard now.

35
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,454
Hard that nothing can't ever touch us.

36
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:05,285
I want to go home.

37
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:08,648
We can't. We stick together no matter what.

38
00:04:08,978 --> 00:04:11,788
and take care of anyone
who gets in our way.

39
00:04:12,122 --> 00:04:14,599
Can you do that little brother?

40
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,975
They're coming...can you run?...Ok.

41
00:04:25,981 --> 00:04:28,489
Keep on running.
Don't look back.

42
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,350
Back-to-back!

43
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,258
Enough! Enough!

44
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:58,133
Stand down, soldier!

45
00:07:12,187 --> 00:07:14,233
Stand down!

46
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,599
Victor, NO!

47
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
Ready!

48
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,121
Aim!

49
00:07:50,122 --> 00:07:52,122
Wake me when it's over.

50
00:07:57,855 --> 00:07:59,855
Fire!

51
00:08:10,905 --> 00:08:13,220
My name is Major William Stryker.

52
00:08:13,255 --> 00:08:16,646
You were sentenced to death
for decapitating a senior officer.

53
00:08:16,681 --> 00:08:18,451
Is that correct?

54
00:08:18,452 --> 00:08:20,752
Apparently we have some
issues with authority ...

55
00:08:20,887 --> 00:08:22,849
- just keep a****on it.

56
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,657
- Sir.

57
00:08:24,658 --> 00:08:26,876
The ****tells me that your sentence
was carried out

58
00:08:26,911 --> 00:08:29,144
by a firing squad at 1000 hours

59
00:08:29,462 --> 00:08:32,376
- How that go?
- It tickle.

60
00:08:36,691 --> 00:08:39,113
You Boys tired of running?

61
00:08:39,148 --> 00:08:41,990
Tired of denying your...true nature?

62
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:44,400
- What do you care?
-Oh I care ...

63
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,290
I care cause I know how
special you are,

64
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,100
how valuable.

65
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:54,913
Look ...

66
00:08:54,914 --> 00:08:58,400
You can stay here, locked up
like freaks of nature.

67
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,172
or you can join me.

68
00:09:01,524 --> 00:09:06,449
I'm putting together a special team
with special privileges.

69
00:09:06,882 --> 00:09:11,434
Now tell me...how would you like
to really serve your country?

70
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,863
******.

71
00:09:27,898 --> 00:09:29,898
- You wanna know why?
- No.

72
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,408
It's memorable.

73
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:34,902
Sure, it's little bulky, to have
to get 'em on a plane

74
00:09:34,937 --> 00:09:37,989
****a couple of swords
on your ex-girlfriends wedding,

75
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:40,679
They will never, ever forget it.

76
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:44,633
That's funny, Wade.
I didn't think you like girls.

77
00:09:46,114 --> 00:09:49,692
Right it's...it's probably not
as intimidating as having a gun

78
00:09:49,727 --> 00:09:53,218
or bone claws or the fingernails
of a****lady...

79
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:05,717
- Manicure?
- Victor...easy.

80
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,201
Speaking of sharp,
Fred got a new tattoo.

81
00:10:09,236 --> 00:10:13,314
- I'm concerned.
- God, only you know her last night.

82
00:10:13,653 --> 00:10:16,420
- I love it.
- I love you after one night?

83
00:10:16,455 --> 00:10:19,174
It's a gymnast.

84
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,672
Bradley, land.

85
00:10:28,082 --> 00:10:29,702
A to vomiþi?

86
00:10:29,703 --> 00:10:31,517
If we were to fly fãcuþi,
we would have grown wings.

87
00:10:31,518 --> 00:10:32,661
Do not you worry, nice,

88
00:10:32,662 --> 00:10:33,833
died many people
injury in your car than flying.

89
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,563
But in between and þeapã?

90
00:10:35,564 --> 00:10:38,616
Be nice.
Or even close.

91
00:10:39,436 --> 00:10:41,735
You want a bucket?

92
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,816
Gentlemen, I landed in Lagos
in five minutes.

93
00:10:49,127 --> 00:10:51,957
Lagos, Nigeria

94
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,543
- Why are we here?
- All in good time. Zero ...

95
00:12:07,524 --> 00:12:10,304
- Victor, oversees the area.
- No fun?

96
00:12:15,576 --> 00:12:17,842
- Fred ...
- Tank?

97
00:12:17,877 --> 00:12:21,114
- Tank.
- Very good.

98
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,594
Super!

99
00:12:57,595 --> 00:13:00,653
Stuck in the elevator with five guys
a diet with more protein.

100
00:13:00,688 --> 00:13:02,331
- Wade!
- Even dreams are fulfilled.

101
00:13:02,332 --> 00:13:04,375
Shut up! You follow.

102
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,420
Thank you, sir.
Arãtaþi very well today.

103
00:13:06,455 --> 00:13:07,385
Because the color green.

104
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,202
We stick evidenþã
seriousness of the eye.

105
00:13:09,203 --> 00:13:12,954
- God, you do not shut up at once?
- No. They are not awake.

106
00:13:13,797 --> 00:13:16,676
Bradley, on the top floor, please.

107
00:13:24,647 --> 00:13:27,427
Go to the elevator!
Elevator!

108
00:13:37,195 --> 00:13:39,195
It's time to put me on the job.

109
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,172
Ready!

110
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:19,173
They all died!

111
00:14:21,378 --> 00:14:24,768
N If you have a mouth so big,
you were perfect soldier, Wade.

112
00:14:37,266 --> 00:14:41,008
Take diamonds, are yours.

113
00:14:41,043 --> 00:14:44,751
Do not you want diamonds.
That I want.

114
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:48,880
That? It's nothing. It's a souvenir.

115
00:14:48,915 --> 00:14:52,394
Where did you find? Tell me the source.

116
00:14:52,772 --> 00:14:58,489
In a small village, far into the
country, three days walk from here.

117
00:15:00,396 --> 00:15:04,180
Tell him that this stone is precious
for me than his life.

118
00:15:04,215 --> 00:15:06,215
Ask him where he found it.

119
00:15:19,231 --> 00:15:21,418
He said that came from heaven.

120
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:27,119
Tell the truth.

121
00:15:27,903 --> 00:15:31,245
- Do not you know the language, Logan.
- It's a piece of meteorite.

122
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,076
I know what e.
I wondered where he found.

123
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:37,252
Sir, those at the base
will tie you to where we are.

124
00:15:37,287 --> 00:15:39,287
Interrupt communications.

125
00:15:42,045 --> 00:15:47,380
Tell everybody you gonna die
if you tell me where he found the stone.

126
00:15:56,626 --> 00:16:00,112
- He said that is sacred.
- Okay.

127
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,550
Victor ...

128
00:16:21,912 --> 00:16:23,912
Victor!

129
00:16:26,335 --> 00:16:28,554
No you do not you Think!

130
00:16:30,351 --> 00:16:33,498
Not for what I came here.

131
00:16:36,072 --> 00:16:38,424
Put your hand down.

132
00:16:50,261 --> 00:16:52,279
What are you doing?

133
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:56,437
We go in the end, fine.
Do not spoil everything.

134
00:16:56,472 --> 00:16:59,705
- Enough. I've done enough.
- Who are you?

135
00:17:00,092 --> 00:17:02,302
That we do.

136
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,845
Preferred to decompose are
in a ravine

137
00:17:04,846 --> 00:17:07,779
up-and gave into someone
how to do otherwise?

138
00:17:09,171 --> 00:17:11,171
I have done.

139
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,634
Come with me?

140
00:17:21,132 --> 00:17:23,132
Jimmy!

141
00:17:27,972 --> 00:17:31,271
I can let you go I a.

142
00:17:39,069 --> 00:17:41,069
Jimmy!

143
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,911
Jimmy!

144
00:18:08,902 --> 00:18:11,496
Muntii Stânco and in Canada,
6 years later

145
00:18:33,925 --> 00:18:35,970
Why are you awake so early?

146
00:18:38,235 --> 00:18:40,313
Come here.

147
00:19:18,511 --> 00:19:20,511
See you later, sweetie.

148
00:19:29,749 --> 00:19:32,497
Very nice! Yes!

149
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:52,360
Springfield, Ohio

150
00:19:58,236 --> 00:20:00,236
No. Come on.

151
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:22,066
You know what to do?

152
00:20:23,313 --> 00:20:26,040
If I succeed stingeþi to light,
tigaþi as a prize.

153
00:20:26,075 --> 00:20:28,767
- Cost U.S. dollars a test.
- Come on, I want to try!

154
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,860
Normal.

155
00:20:41,146 --> 00:20:43,459
It's the second attempt.

156
00:20:51,466 --> 00:20:56,244
- How cheap trick.
- There is a trick, man.

157
00:20:56,615 --> 00:20:58,615
Let's go.

158
00:21:00,306 --> 00:21:02,306
Bye!

159
00:21:30,342 --> 00:21:32,342
He finished the show!

160
00:21:36,985 --> 00:21:39,886
I said that it ended the show!

161
00:21:44,214 --> 00:21:47,546
For us, the show
It never ends, Bradley.

162
00:21:49,324 --> 00:21:52,656
- Victor ...
- I'm in inviþi?

163
00:21:54,393 --> 00:21:57,000
Yes, come.

164
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:15,192
Do you know that I never said
anything to anybody about what happened.

165
00:22:15,227 --> 00:22:17,664
Lead a life totally different now, Victor.

166
00:22:17,699 --> 00:22:19,896
No need to disturb the past.

167
00:22:35,211 --> 00:22:37,273
You know ...

168
00:22:37,636 --> 00:22:41,933
I always thought
Wade you'll beat me to the door.

169
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:47,765
Well, Wade went.

170
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,090
I fear you, Victor.

171
00:22:56,165 --> 00:22:58,251
I fear death.

172
00:22:59,548 --> 00:23:04,439
How do you know?
You never tried it.

173
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:24,671
You dreamed about wars?

174
00:23:25,211 --> 00:23:29,300
- Which one?
- All.

175
00:23:36,723 --> 00:23:39,224
Tell me ...

176
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:42,724
It's just a scratch.

177
00:23:49,396 --> 00:23:52,474
It seems that one and we need to
ternuturi and to us.

178
00:23:52,509 --> 00:23:54,509
Yes ...

179
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:21,113
Who the hell is that?

180
00:24:21,148 --> 00:24:23,318
I smell government.

181
00:24:27,361 --> 00:24:29,732
God!
You have not even aged a day!

182
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:31,519
I lived clean.

183
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,407
Can you know the agent Zero.

184
00:24:33,408 --> 00:24:35,950
Still chicken questions
after pulling a gun?

185
00:24:37,445 --> 00:24:39,856
You still smoke cheap cigars?

186
00:24:39,891 --> 00:24:44,344
Boys, please.
I have a job for you.

187
00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:46,769
- I already have working.
- Lumberman?

188
00:24:46,804 --> 00:24:49,124
- 18 thousand a year?
- 18 thousand and 500.

189
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:51,366
Plus that I never had
to kill someone for a while.

190
00:24:51,401 --> 00:24:53,584
- I began to miss?
- Now, yes.

191
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:56,473
Zero, back to your car.

192
00:24:58,877 --> 00:25:00,877
Good boy.

193
00:25:07,188 --> 00:25:10,440
I'm not proud of the way
how things are over between us.

194
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:12,475
Conversation that took end.

195
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:17,909
Play of the house in the middle preeriei
together with a teacher

196
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,559
do not you stay in town, Logan.

197
00:25:20,594 --> 00:25:22,988
- And you know that?
- Yes.

198
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:28,740
- What do you want, Stryker?
- Bradley was killed three days ago.

199
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:32,614
Wade even before.

200
00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:35,802
I think someone wants to kill
former members of our team.

201
00:25:36,823 --> 00:25:38,554
Anybody else?

202
00:25:38,555 --> 00:25:41,271
From what I know,
Victor is safe.

203
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:47,238
- Anyone would have names, addresses ...
- Can I wear and own career.

204
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,403
It's not about you, Logan.

205
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:57,183
Country needs you.

206
00:25:58,058 --> 00:26:00,058
I am Canadian.

207
00:26:00,787 --> 00:26:03,841
I know you, Logan! I know who you are!

208
00:26:41,758 --> 00:26:43,758
What happened?

209
00:26:45,289 --> 00:26:49,795
A Stryker passed on to me today.
Do not you worry, I refused.

210
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,607
Why are you bothering
atâþia after years?

211
00:26:52,947 --> 00:26:55,426
Because I'm the best
in what I do.

212
00:26:55,461 --> 00:26:57,492
And not too good
who are working best.

213
00:26:57,527 --> 00:27:00,650
No you're an animal, Logan.
You have a gift.

214
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:04,663
A gift? He's back.

215
00:27:17,088 --> 00:27:19,088
Come on, boys!

216
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:25,984
- Stay in your car.
- You can ask them nicely.

217
00:27:30,123 --> 00:27:32,365
We want to leave and new
to go beyond?

218
00:27:32,748 --> 00:27:35,658
Your time are you, buddy?

219
00:27:35,972 --> 00:27:39,487
- Move you and your car, go to ...
- We want and we can talk, right?

220
00:27:39,522 --> 00:27:42,581
If you start something,
Be ready to and finish.

221
00:27:43,467 --> 00:27:45,796
Boys, u º urel!

222
00:27:50,757 --> 00:27:53,828
- Your friend is pretty big mouth.
- I know.

223
00:27:53,863 --> 00:27:58,036
It quickly and nettle,
so that leaves us to go, please.

224
00:28:02,466 --> 00:28:04,466
Thanks!

225
00:28:06,803 --> 00:28:08,803
How did it succeed?

226
00:28:08,957 --> 00:28:11,807
You know, the power of persuasion is a gift.

227
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:15,402
Understand ...
You and this power over me?

228
00:28:15,437 --> 00:28:18,278
You have left in your car, right?

229
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:37,227
Why is it so lonely months?

230
00:28:38,378 --> 00:28:40,128
Why?

231
00:28:40,129 --> 00:28:42,470
Because I have a boyfriend.

232
00:28:42,505 --> 00:28:44,882
- You say that and children?
- No.

233
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,294
His name was Kuekuatsheu
and the spirits living in the world together.

234
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:51,368
So a true story ...

235
00:28:52,067 --> 00:28:55,757
And every night,
walk in the sky together.

236
00:28:56,445 --> 00:29:00,840
But one of the spirits
was jealous.

237
00:29:01,186 --> 00:29:04,504
Trickster (ª mecherul) wanted Month
only for him.

238
00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:08,593
so that he told his Kuekuatsheu
Luna asked that flowers.

239
00:29:08,977 --> 00:29:12,702
I was told to come into our world
I like to collect some dogberry,

240
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:16,821
Kuekuatsheu but not people
I once left the world spirits,

241
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:20,403
not be able to return.

242
00:29:20,438 --> 00:29:26,438
Every night, looking to heaven
and sees the moon and they scream your name.

243
00:29:30,015 --> 00:29:36,015
But it can never achieve.

244
00:29:38,515 --> 00:29:41,254
Koo-koo-choose was diddled.

245
00:29:42,586 --> 00:29:44,642
Kuekuatsheu.

246
00:29:50,977 --> 00:29:54,708
Means Wolverine (Bursuc).

247
00:30:54,374 --> 00:30:56,374
How are you, Logan?

248
00:31:51,114 --> 00:31:53,114
Kayla!

249
00:32:56,527 --> 00:32:59,158
You're not from the area, is it?

250
00:33:04,032 --> 00:33:06,032
What gave me away?

251
00:33:10,232 --> 00:33:13,561
- You insurance locally?
- Insurance?

252
00:33:14,204 --> 00:33:16,027
No.

253
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:18,028
Too bad.

254
00:33:32,548 --> 00:33:36,363
Well, well, well ...
Look what the cat brought.

255
00:33:36,627 --> 00:33:39,757
Boys, whatever it is,
Take yourself out.

256
00:33:50,531 --> 00:33:54,516
- Why?
- Why?

257
00:33:58,851 --> 00:34:04,851
Do not call, I write ...
How else to capture your attention?

258
00:34:46,102 --> 00:34:49,844
I hate to say, James,
but, frankly, are a little disappointed.

259
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,520
Stay down.

260
00:35:31,882 --> 00:35:35,712
Tell me, Jimmy, was worth it?

261
00:35:56,039 --> 00:36:01,713
When you give your account
that we are not like them?

262
00:36:02,812 --> 00:36:08,812
- I am not like you.
- Yes. I just do not know yet.

263
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:27,896
- What do we have?
- A fight in the bar.

264
00:36:27,897 --> 00:36:29,897
Has several wounds by knife.

265
00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:33,706
What is this a joke?
The guy has nothing.

266
00:36:33,741 --> 00:36:35,348
Where is he?

267
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:36,548
I asked where he is!

268
00:36:36,549 --> 00:36:38,098
I do not know who e.

269
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:40,099
I can help you.

270
00:36:45,288 --> 00:36:49,006
For six years stay.
I know nobody's tea, then you have come!

271
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:52,724
- The next day, he died!
- I tried to warn you.

272
00:36:52,759 --> 00:36:55,722
- Why do not you told me is that Victor?
- I and tiut!

273
00:36:59,364 --> 00:37:02,214
I swear on my life son!

274
00:37:10,372 --> 00:37:12,964
Victor's appetite has become
too strong.

275
00:37:12,999 --> 00:37:16,390
I was forced to close.
He thought that I have betrayed.

276
00:37:16,595 --> 00:37:20,716
He left without authorized
and said that one to come after us all.

277
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:24,452
You have come to warn me that.
You came to save your skin.

278
00:37:25,385 --> 00:37:27,337
What you plan, captain?

279
00:37:27,338 --> 00:37:29,418
You can not defeat it, Logan.
You know well that you can not.

280
00:37:29,453 --> 00:37:31,453
I find him and he will die.

281
00:37:32,721 --> 00:37:35,092
I can provide the means to kill.

282
00:37:39,398 --> 00:37:44,435
- Yet it can save others.
- As you însuþi, right?

283
00:37:45,515 --> 00:37:47,665
Q and promise two things.

284
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,869
A to suporþi more pain
than any human can endure,

285
00:37:50,904 --> 00:37:53,436
but to avenge you.

286
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:59,565
If you come with you, I want blood.

287
00:38:00,652 --> 00:38:03,706
Without law, without honor.

288
00:38:04,107 --> 00:38:08,184
Told me about the correct direction
and ride the hell out of my way.

289
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:49,958
When you begin the process,

290
00:38:49,959 --> 00:38:52,611
any reason
for doing this,

291
00:38:52,646 --> 00:38:55,802
focus back to this
maybe you can be helpful.

292
00:38:55,837 --> 00:38:58,475
Believe me, I went
the situation worse.

293
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,510
I think not.

294
00:39:01,222 --> 00:39:03,222
We are ready.

295
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:09,507
Oh you do not indestructible,
But first, you must destroy.

296
00:39:12,478 --> 00:39:17,030
- May þii mind find in Africa?
- Yes.

297
00:39:17,065 --> 00:39:23,065
I have found. He helped to create
a metal alloy as strong,

298
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:27,345
that practically
you can bear anything.

299
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,072
Is called adamantiu.

300
00:39:30,991 --> 00:39:34,110
I can not stop Victor
alone, Logan.

301
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:39,723
To kill him,
will have to choose the other,

302
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:43,447
animal to become ...

303
00:39:45,298 --> 00:39:47,298
Go to start.

304
00:39:47,613 --> 00:39:49,613
I almost forgot.

305
00:39:52,304 --> 00:39:54,371
I want more.

306
00:39:54,834 --> 00:39:56,834
What do you write them?

307
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,162
Wolverine.

308
00:40:17,361 --> 00:40:20,054
Dlor General, welcome.

309
00:40:20,769 --> 00:40:22,769
Mr Munson.

310
00:40:23,176 --> 00:40:26,314
Today, you will witness
a piece of medical history.

311
00:40:26,523 --> 00:40:29,847
- Today, we will create weapon X.
- X?

312
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:33,065
From Roman numeral 10.

313
00:40:34,442 --> 00:40:39,551
We are about to lipim adamantiu
skeleton of X. Arms

314
00:40:39,897 --> 00:40:41,897
Let's start.

315
00:41:28,371 --> 00:41:30,371
<i> - We fraþi, Jimmy.
- Logan! </ I></i>

316
00:41:30,499 --> 00:41:32,718
Body temperature is 42 degrees
and grow in the future.

317
00:41:35,861 --> 00:41:38,497
Why do you?
Why not sedated?

318
00:41:38,532 --> 00:41:42,101
Feel the pain as all the world
anestezicul but has no effect on him.

319
00:41:42,136 --> 00:41:44,136
Of these had
to volunteer.

320
00:41:44,656 --> 00:41:46,236
195.

321
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,021
- A to supravieþuiascã?
- I do not know.

322
00:41:48,022 --> 00:41:50,022
200.

323
00:41:51,862 --> 00:41:53,862
<i> ... son. </ i></i>

324
00:41:54,505 --> 00:41:56,257
Heart rhythm is close to maximum.

325
00:41:56,258 --> 00:41:58,644
- Voltage?
- 260 180.

326
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:00,679
A eascã to succeed.

327
00:42:05,634 --> 00:42:07,634
<i>Victor ! </ i></i>

328
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,437
<i> I love you. </ i></i>

329
00:42:14,438 --> 00:42:16,514
<i> No you're an animal, Logan. </ i></i>

330
00:42:22,226 --> 00:42:24,226
<i>Bursuc  means. </ i></i>

331
00:42:50,814 --> 00:42:53,002
Seems that may die.

332
00:43:24,903 --> 00:43:27,573
Come on, buddy. Snap.

333
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:32,232
Heart rhythm grow up.

334
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:35,182
Adamantiu tank is empty.

335
00:43:35,776 --> 00:43:38,823
It was rejected.
The procedure is complete.

336
00:43:38,858 --> 00:43:40,265
I succeed in it!

337
00:43:40,266 --> 00:43:42,266
Yes!

338
00:43:48,045 --> 00:43:50,108
To take him on island?

339
00:43:50,452 --> 00:43:53,138
On the island? No.

340
00:43:53,966 --> 00:43:58,912
Soldering work.
One can use the DNA to XI.

341
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,237
I delete them memories.

342
00:44:06,341 --> 00:44:08,341
"Prãjiþi 's brain!

343
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:19,579
I think you heard.

344
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:37,072
Close the room!

345
00:45:13,417 --> 00:45:16,904
Search him and take his head.

346
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,255
Travis!

347
00:46:07,118 --> 00:46:11,684
I think we have a naked man in the barn.

348
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,468
Boys ...

349
00:46:46,834 --> 00:46:48,831
What are you doing?

350
00:46:48,832 --> 00:46:52,129
- It's cold.
- Cold?

351
00:46:55,391 --> 00:47:00,752
- You are naked.
- I know.

352
00:47:00,787 --> 00:47:04,382
- You take drugs, right?
- No.

353
00:47:05,253 --> 00:47:09,362
- You had a busy night.
- It may be said, and you a.

354
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:13,745
Come on home.

355
00:47:13,904 --> 00:47:16,998
Likely to suit you
some of the clothes of my son.

356
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:20,310
Here, cover yourself with it.

357
00:47:20,679 --> 00:47:23,696
I do not want to cause them to Mrs.
a heart attack.

358
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:10,969
You are okay?

359
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:12,970
Everything is fine.

360
00:48:13,953 --> 00:48:17,736
- I had dinner.
- Coming soon.

361
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:31,768
I swear I'll pay for it.

362
00:48:33,179 --> 00:48:35,379
Put it down there.

363
00:48:40,467 --> 00:48:42,467
Come and sit down, boy.

364
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:51,068
I can not thank you enough.

365
00:48:51,103 --> 00:48:53,937
It would have been decent
I can not let there frozen.

366
00:48:54,385 --> 00:48:57,281
- Decent ...
- What?

367
00:48:57,632 --> 00:49:01,417
Nothing, just that there are too common and nuit
with this word.

368
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:07,363
- Nice bike you have.
- You know?

369
00:49:07,398 --> 00:49:08,981
God, and begin.

370
00:49:08,982 --> 00:49:10,371
My favorite
Harley Davidson Panhead is 48.

371
00:49:10,372 --> 00:49:11,630
I had a new nouþã.

372
00:49:11,631 --> 00:49:14,375
I think you're a little young
for such a thing.

373
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:17,607
You must be exhausted.
Do you rest you tonight.

374
00:49:17,642 --> 00:49:19,642
In the barn.

375
00:49:20,215 --> 00:49:22,576
There can not hurt anything.

376
00:49:35,898 --> 00:49:37,898
<i> I love you. </ i></i>

377
00:49:38,425 --> 00:49:41,355
<i> - Why is it so lonely months?
- Why </ i></i>

378
00:49:42,939 --> 00:49:45,512
<i> Because I have a boyfriend. </ i></i>

379
00:49:47,522 --> 00:49:50,223
<i> But it can never achieve. </ i></i>

380
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:14,590
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

381
00:50:16,204 --> 00:50:20,359
There seem to be
a man put on misdoings.

382
00:50:21,989 --> 00:50:25,603
You know what happens
a man who wants blood?

383
00:50:25,907 --> 00:50:29,767
- What?
- I found you.

384
00:50:32,247 --> 00:50:36,126
- With all we have a choice, boy.
- I no longer am.

385
00:50:36,161 --> 00:50:38,161
Nonsense.

386
00:50:41,863 --> 00:50:44,139
This jacket was my boy.

387
00:50:46,114 --> 00:50:48,114
Prove it.

388
00:51:03,344 --> 00:51:07,168
- Thanks.
- Yes ...

389
00:51:07,944 --> 00:51:12,653
You can take my bike on a ride,
to test the matter.

390
00:51:13,661 --> 00:51:16,008
About'64 ...

391
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:22,069
- Heavy's are.
- I put something on me recently.

392
00:51:22,104 --> 00:51:24,104
Good morning!

393
00:51:27,981 --> 00:51:29,981
I came perfect!

394
00:51:31,445 --> 00:51:33,445
I brought you some ...

395
00:51:41,655 --> 00:51:44,392
<i>Gun  X is in the barn.
I just killed two civilians. </ I></i>

396
00:51:44,427 --> 00:51:47,699
Bombardaþi it, let's see
if you survive.

397
00:52:00,279 --> 00:52:02,279
<i> Fire at will! </ i></i>

398
00:52:10,976 --> 00:52:12,976
Come after me!

399
00:52:25,516 --> 00:52:27,338
Let them fly brains!

400
00:52:27,339 --> 00:52:29,339
Damn!

401
00:53:04,783 --> 00:53:06,783
1 alpha, not lose it!

402
00:53:14,993 --> 00:53:17,227
<i>Alfa  2, comes to you! </ i></i>

403
00:54:08,262 --> 00:54:10,262
<i> Up! </ i></i>

404
00:55:10,447 --> 00:55:12,447
<i> Zero! </ i></i>

405
00:55:14,035 --> 00:55:16,035
<i> Zero, Logan is dead </ i></i>

406
00:55:20,696 --> 00:55:22,696
<i> Zero, answer!</i>

407
00:55:24,262 --> 00:55:26,330
<i>L  have it?</i>

408
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:28,399
No, I was smitten.

409
00:55:30,977 --> 00:55:32,977
<i> Zero, answer!</i>

410
00:55:37,118 --> 00:55:39,118
<i> You tried to kill me?</i>

411
00:55:39,356 --> 00:55:40,478
Logan?

412
00:55:40,479 --> 00:55:41,765
Where is Victor?

413
00:55:41,766 --> 00:55:43,702
Go back to base.

414
00:55:43,703 --> 00:55:45,761
I can explain everything to you
and you catch Victor together.

415
00:55:45,796 --> 00:55:47,424
<i>Answer  gre º it.</i>

416
00:55:47,425 --> 00:55:50,127
After you kill Victor,
Friday after you.

417
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,900
<i> Logan, listen to me.</i>

418
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:57,454
If you go down this road,
is not possible you'll like what you found.

419
00:55:58,645 --> 00:56:02,827
You wanted an animal, Colonel ...
Now you got.

420
00:56:07,252 --> 00:56:09,928
Those were good people.

421
00:56:10,176 --> 00:56:12,286
People nevinovaþi.

422
00:56:18,128 --> 00:56:21,974
Funny how people nevinovaþi
the tendency to die around you.

423
00:56:46,285 --> 00:56:48,735
Zero never had any chance you.

424
00:56:49,123 --> 00:56:52,583
The only thing that can beat him
is a glonþ of adamantiu.

425
00:57:00,109 --> 00:57:02,877
Facility is compromised.
Prepares the shipment.

426
00:57:12,035 --> 00:57:14,534
Colonel, the situation started
to turn into a disaster.

427
00:57:14,569 --> 00:57:16,569
- You do not worry, it'll stop.
- Really?

428
00:57:16,584 --> 00:57:20,148
I just spent half a billion
of dollars to get him indestructible.

429
00:57:23,056 --> 00:57:24,506
- Sir?
- Yes.

430
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:27,608
Young mutant you look ...
I have found.

431
00:57:28,088 --> 00:57:30,743
General Logan is the only missing piece
of the puzzle.

432
00:57:30,778 --> 00:57:34,754
Must evacuate the building.
Please, please întorceþi Washington.

433
00:57:34,964 --> 00:57:36,964
We have work to do.

434
00:57:38,949 --> 00:57:42,636
I talk, you talk you, he?

435
00:57:42,671 --> 00:57:44,545
We translate anyone?

436
00:57:44,546 --> 00:57:46,546
Summers?

437
00:57:46,576 --> 00:57:49,194
Stand up and let down your glasses.

438
00:57:50,373 --> 00:57:52,606
My head hurts.

439
00:57:52,939 --> 00:57:54,939
Then you can segment them in detention,

440
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:57,739
after hours
when you conjugate a verb 100 times.

441
00:57:57,774 --> 00:57:59,279
Anyone else?

442
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,716
He speaks up.

443
00:58:00,717 --> 00:58:02,784
Very good.
He speaks up.

444
00:58:14,253 --> 00:58:16,551
- Sure was Victor?
- Yes.

445
00:58:17,539 --> 00:58:19,819
Damn!

446
00:58:19,854 --> 00:58:21,896
I'm sorry, man.

447
00:58:24,254 --> 00:58:26,652
What the hell happened to him
after you've left me?

448
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:28,333
It was hopeless.

449
00:58:28,334 --> 00:58:29,949
He thought that you abandoned.

450
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:31,865
I thought all this.

451
00:58:31,866 --> 00:58:35,647
But Victor wanted to demonstrate
that was better than you.

452
00:58:35,682 --> 00:58:38,462
He began to hunt and to kill
everything's out in her way.

453
00:58:38,764 --> 00:58:42,854
I renunþat and I after a few months.
I supported them to gather.

454
00:58:43,859 --> 00:58:46,651
- Who to pick?
- Let a and a.

455
00:58:46,686 --> 00:58:48,686
Who to pick, John?

456
00:58:49,282 --> 00:58:51,286
Damn, John!

457
00:58:51,321 --> 00:58:53,687
I hunted those like us, Logan.

458
00:58:53,903 --> 00:58:56,471
We have a place reserved in hell
for the things I did in November.

459
00:58:56,506 --> 00:58:58,372
Mutanþi?

460
00:58:58,373 --> 00:59:00,373
Why?

461
00:59:00,389 --> 00:59:02,981
Stryker says
that we can make a difference.

462
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:06,044
That protect people from the bad.

463
00:59:13,906 --> 00:59:16,411
How it rãpui Victor, Logan?

464
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:20,553
- May þii remember that thing in Africa?
- I remember Africa, what about her?

465
00:59:24,783 --> 00:59:26,783
Vai de mine!

466
00:59:27,489 --> 00:59:29,489
What have you done?

467
00:59:29,697 --> 00:59:31,697
Do not ask.

468
00:59:33,692 --> 00:59:37,035
Zero said something to an island.
I know something about this?

469
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:38,159
No.

470
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,803
But you can tie Dukes.

471
00:59:39,804 --> 00:59:41,897
- They were two good friends.
- Fred Dukes?

472
00:59:41,932 --> 00:59:43,274
- Where is it?
- It's here.

473
00:59:43,275 --> 00:59:45,260
- Come to talk with him.
- Hold you a.

474
00:59:45,261 --> 00:59:47,177
He never passed the fourth round.

475
00:59:47,178 --> 00:59:50,417
Must warn you,
developed a food problem.

476
00:59:50,452 --> 00:59:54,105
All have mechanisms for adaptation.
Trying to bring back him in shape.

477
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:57,759
Come on, if you want to get in shape,
you must move it.

478
00:59:57,794 --> 00:59:59,794
I told you that I do not move it.

479
01:00:04,221 --> 01:00:06,820
Fred Dukes? I think the thing is
he ate Fred.

480
01:00:06,855 --> 01:00:09,401
Whatever you do,
not tell anything about weight.

481
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:12,680
Hey, Fat, that is, Fred.

482
01:00:13,361 --> 01:00:16,221
I see that you remember that girl
when was 50 kg.

483
01:00:18,385 --> 01:00:22,782
- How funny are you, Logan.
- I know where is Victor?

484
01:00:24,158 --> 01:00:25,187
I have no idea.

485
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:27,356
What island slãbuþule?

486
01:00:29,274 --> 01:00:31,550
Take care not to hit the door
you go, Logan.

487
01:00:31,879 --> 01:00:36,963
Come on, umblatule tell me where is Victor.
For old times' sake.

488
01:00:38,194 --> 01:00:42,479
Have you done any inflated?

489
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:45,450
No!

490
01:00:51,104 --> 01:00:52,693
I told you I
I can not say anything about weight.

491
01:00:52,694 --> 01:00:53,987
Why did you bloated?

492
01:00:53,988 --> 01:00:56,368
I said bloated, I have been told.

493
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:58,403
Goddamn it!

494
01:00:58,612 --> 01:01:00,612
I have an idea.

495
01:01:01,654 --> 01:01:04,059
- That you think that's a good idea?
- Trying to help you, Logan.

496
01:01:04,094 --> 01:01:06,059
Dukes does not like you too,
and you know it.

497
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:07,285
The feeling is mutual.

498
01:01:07,286 --> 01:01:09,758
Use the manu and parties,
a little dance with him.

499
01:01:09,793 --> 01:01:11,943
Let him free-and rage.

500
01:01:12,506 --> 01:01:15,326
I think that if it and make it
you'll say all I want you to know.

501
01:01:15,569 --> 01:01:17,402
Look and you to him.

502
01:01:17,403 --> 01:01:19,888
I can see the bottom of the shirt front.

503
01:01:20,148 --> 01:01:22,794
Jesus, like he ate
a cornfield maize.

504
01:01:22,829 --> 01:01:25,452
Have a fair enough
order to remove him from here?

505
01:01:27,299 --> 01:01:29,480
Do not you worry
stretcher for him.

506
01:01:29,685 --> 01:01:31,685
You are a bastard.

507
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:35,138
Knock it mar!

508
01:01:35,139 --> 01:01:37,312
I let him give.

509
01:01:38,441 --> 01:01:40,668
What would you be?
Want to dance with me?

510
01:01:41,019 --> 01:01:43,019
What's good

511
01:01:46,513 --> 01:01:48,513
Both? No longer can?

512
01:01:49,512 --> 01:01:52,071
Now we can talk,
brought him exactly where I wanted.

513
01:01:52,106 --> 01:01:54,106
You whose side are you?

514
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:31,454
Now, where is Victor?

515
01:03:01,863 --> 01:03:04,437
It's pretty dark for sunglasses,
do not you think?

516
01:03:20,187 --> 01:03:23,062
Please do not kill me!

517
01:03:23,097 --> 01:03:25,097
Victor!

518
01:03:29,374 --> 01:03:31,374
Where's Victor?

519
01:03:33,529 --> 01:03:39,529
Victor is on the island with Stryker,
do this together.

520
01:03:42,089 --> 01:03:42,959
What?

521
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,967
Victor walk with Stryker?

522
01:03:45,002 --> 01:03:46,758
Yes.

523
01:03:46,759 --> 01:03:48,759
Tiai not it?

524
01:04:08,969 --> 01:04:11,044
Now no longer remained
than Logan.

525
01:04:11,045 --> 01:04:14,156
I think you're in
up to him.

526
01:04:14,644 --> 01:04:16,625
I got busy and before, right?

527
01:04:16,626 --> 01:04:18,969
Yes, you e.

528
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:25,939
Understanding our
is still valid, right?

529
01:04:26,859 --> 01:04:28,469
Of course.

530
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:31,100
Now pack it
and numbered it, Captain.

531
01:04:39,269 --> 01:04:41,378
What is this island?

532
01:04:42,861 --> 01:04:46,471
Place where it leads Stryker
after I catch Victor.

533
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:49,878
Who leads?

534
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:52,940
On mutanþi.

535
01:04:53,213 --> 01:04:57,980
It is said that Stryker
do experiments on them.

536
01:05:00,227 --> 01:05:02,618
You have never asked
what happened to them?

537
01:05:02,653 --> 01:05:04,951
I tried not to do that.

538
01:05:20,778 --> 01:05:25,529
They killed her
I like to let you get adamantiu me.

539
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,156
They killed her for an experiment.

540
01:05:34,422 --> 01:05:36,300
Where is it?

541
01:05:36,301 --> 01:05:39,170
Logan, Stryker keep secret place.

542
01:05:43,141 --> 01:05:45,330
But ...

543
01:05:45,968 --> 01:05:48,518
- A prisoner escaped from there sometime.
- Who?

544
01:05:48,553 --> 01:05:50,727
His name is Remy LeBeau.

545
01:05:50,762 --> 01:05:52,867
A crook in New Orleans.

546
01:05:52,902 --> 01:05:57,561
The guards there said they Gambia,
because they always take the money from poker.

547
01:05:57,596 --> 01:06:00,054
What Stryker wants to achieve?

548
01:06:02,569 --> 01:06:06,716
To take power,
attempts to combine them somehow.

549
01:06:07,065 --> 01:06:09,460
It's all I know, Logan.

550
01:06:10,796 --> 01:06:13,860
If you need to get back here
a tai to your head.

551
01:06:18,131 --> 01:06:20,131
Come with you, Logan.

552
01:06:21,692 --> 01:06:24,197
- I found your salvation where I go.
- Not asking that.

553
01:07:02,062 --> 01:07:04,062
He's our man.

554
01:07:10,265 --> 01:07:12,265
It's tough.

555
01:07:12,344 --> 01:07:15,617
- I'm going back, if that runs.
- Do not fight with anyone.

556
01:07:15,975 --> 01:07:17,577
- How not to.
- What?

557
01:07:17,578 --> 01:07:19,019
I think that fight everyone?

558
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:21,075
Dogs do not kill cats?

559
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:23,130
Get back soon.

560
01:07:35,521 --> 01:07:38,381
You are Remy LeBeau?

561
01:07:39,631 --> 01:07:41,478
I owe money?

562
01:07:41,479 --> 01:07:43,479
No.

563
01:07:43,775 --> 01:07:45,849
Where are Remy LeBeau.

564
01:08:04,189 --> 01:08:07,141
Big blind is 100,
and the low is 50.

565
01:08:08,047 --> 01:08:09,968
Take a hand?

566
01:08:09,969 --> 01:08:12,218
I get the $ 17?

567
01:08:13,174 --> 01:08:15,174
$ 17?

568
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,854
A way home by taxi, maybe.

569
01:08:22,446 --> 01:08:24,822
You are a new babysitter to my brother, John?

570
01:08:26,095 --> 01:08:27,893
I do not like Bradley, Victor.

571
01:08:27,894 --> 01:08:29,787
And people in black clothes
not scare me.

572
01:08:29,788 --> 01:08:31,615
Really?

573
01:08:31,616 --> 01:08:33,616
It worked with Dukes.

574
01:08:33,872 --> 01:08:37,201
Too bad, because now you can kill you.
Logan never to have a chance.

575
01:08:38,209 --> 01:08:41,021
And what you get
in our beautiful town, sir?

576
01:08:41,056 --> 01:08:43,081
Victor Creed.

577
01:08:45,254 --> 01:08:47,254
And who is he?

578
01:08:47,257 --> 01:08:49,434
The man that can kill.

579
01:08:50,804 --> 01:08:54,115
Working for a man
named Stryker, an island.

580
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:58,464
- Need to know just where e.
- What makes you think you know that?

581
01:08:58,731 --> 01:09:01,500
Because I know who you are, Gambia.

582
01:09:02,592 --> 01:09:06,821
You are the one who escaped
and the right to take me there.

583
01:09:08,721 --> 01:09:10,527
You know, John ...

584
01:09:10,528 --> 01:09:12,588
I always wanted to tell you something.

585
01:09:18,042 --> 01:09:20,498
You are predictable.

586
01:09:24,325 --> 01:09:26,873
I feel column Johnny.

587
01:09:27,609 --> 01:09:30,724
How odd.
I do not think you knew one.

588
01:09:33,929 --> 01:09:37,755
What you tãbliþe beautiful neck.

589
01:09:38,782 --> 01:09:41,961
They did some one thousand and the same.

590
01:09:45,442 --> 01:09:47,513
LeBeau, listen to me ...

591
01:10:21,015 --> 01:10:24,902
Two years I was in that hole,
and you never go back.

592
01:10:27,668 --> 01:10:30,249
What are glossy.

593
01:10:33,067 --> 01:10:35,067
Tell me, Jimmy.

594
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:38,094
Even you know how to kill me?

595
01:10:38,129 --> 01:10:40,719
A tai to your head.

596
01:10:41,596 --> 01:10:43,596
Let's see if it works.

597
01:10:53,242 --> 01:10:55,242
Become ungainly, old man.

598
01:11:04,326 --> 01:11:06,664
Motherfucker ...

599
01:11:10,225 --> 01:11:12,779
O to die
what did you do it.

600
01:11:37,027 --> 01:11:39,027
Victor!

601
01:11:48,068 --> 01:11:50,125
What bãþ beautiful.

602
01:12:49,171 --> 01:12:51,171
Look how to work.

603
01:12:51,356 --> 01:12:53,657
I'm going to the island,
where you can kill

604
01:12:53,658 --> 01:12:56,458
the Creed, Stryker
and all that kind of hatred you are on this world.

605
01:12:56,703 --> 01:12:58,703
Understand?

606
01:12:59,745 --> 01:13:01,175
You want to kill.

607
01:13:01,176 --> 01:13:03,575
As long as I stand in the way, yes.

608
01:13:17,812 --> 01:13:19,812
Colonel.

609
01:13:20,112 --> 01:13:21,279
General?

610
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,674
That weapon is XI?

611
01:13:24,934 --> 01:13:28,077
All their powers,
but none of weakness.

612
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:30,182
Even hate you, not to you?

613
01:13:30,528 --> 01:13:32,436
Do not hate him.

614
01:13:32,437 --> 01:13:35,893
After 20 years of work,
I realize what they are capable.

615
01:13:40,552 --> 01:13:44,627
As the war tigãm before you begin,
will save many vieþi.

616
01:13:44,662 --> 01:13:47,773
Preventive action is the only action.

617
01:13:48,337 --> 01:13:52,456
General, the days on which our country
looked at the edge of the past.

618
01:13:53,078 --> 01:13:56,646
Must take the fight to the enemy
before it to bring us.

619
01:13:57,196 --> 01:14:00,100
- I admire your passion.
- Thanks.

620
01:14:00,864 --> 01:14:03,676
But we stop here.

621
01:14:04,022 --> 01:14:06,232
But Gun X was a small ealã the gre ...

622
01:14:06,267 --> 01:14:08,141
We know your son, Bill.

623
01:14:08,142 --> 01:14:09,947
We know that is a mutant.

624
01:14:09,948 --> 01:14:13,136
We know that you killed wife,
We should not hide it.

625
01:14:13,171 --> 01:14:15,171
This ...

626
01:14:16,397 --> 01:14:19,343
- This has no connection with my work.
- Nonsense!

627
01:14:19,854 --> 01:14:23,055
You are too close to it.
I am sure that you know.

628
01:14:25,447 --> 01:14:28,921
You are right.
Do not you lie.

629
01:14:31,889 --> 01:14:36,892
My son brought me this.

630
01:14:37,281 --> 01:14:39,870
But I took an oath,

631
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:43,417
to protect citizens of this country

632
01:14:43,714 --> 01:14:45,903
any threats

633
01:14:46,106 --> 01:14:48,106
both foreign ...

634
01:14:54,891 --> 01:14:56,891
... as well as internal.

635
01:15:04,409 --> 01:15:06,453
- Not much I like to fly.
- Okay.

636
01:15:06,488 --> 01:15:09,643
- Concentrate to your job.
- I can see you sweating a lot.

637
01:15:09,678 --> 01:15:12,737
- Very funny. Watch the ...
- What? In the clouds?

638
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:16,215
Like a broken disk.
Where did you get this shit?

639
01:15:16,415 --> 01:15:18,863
She is darling.
I like tigat it to a game.

640
01:15:18,898 --> 01:15:21,966
- A handful of valeþi with fives.
- Super ...

641
01:15:23,154 --> 01:15:25,622
Line up the back.
Almost there.

642
01:15:27,242 --> 01:15:28,877
Here it is.

643
01:15:28,878 --> 01:15:30,696
Island.

644
01:15:30,697 --> 01:15:34,202
An island of 5 kilometers
hidden from view.

645
01:15:37,219 --> 01:15:39,882
Nobody wants to come
a nuclear reactor.

646
01:15:39,883 --> 01:15:42,375
People think
I'll turn in my tri's.

647
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:43,688
I like you?

648
01:15:43,689 --> 01:15:45,689
Yes ...

649
01:15:46,825 --> 01:15:48,640
Okay, are you ready?

650
01:15:48,641 --> 01:15:50,251
Now or never.
Come on.

651
01:15:50,252 --> 01:15:52,252
And it was time.

652
01:16:00,787 --> 01:16:03,921
If you are you can do better,
you know that you'll hurt.

653
01:16:03,956 --> 01:16:07,533
Yes, I feel better.

654
01:16:08,161 --> 01:16:10,049
Cheers!

655
01:16:10,050 --> 01:16:12,050
And þie.

656
01:16:13,472 --> 01:16:15,472
Shit!

657
01:16:21,899 --> 01:16:23,613
What do?

658
01:16:23,614 --> 01:16:25,614
Is everything okay?

659
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:28,510
- How long takes?
- A few hours.

660
01:16:28,866 --> 01:16:30,999
A to respond to my commands?

661
01:16:31,034 --> 01:16:33,034
Yes, Colonel.

662
01:17:35,488 --> 01:17:37,488
Logan.

663
01:17:37,971 --> 01:17:39,971
Welcome back to war.

664
01:17:41,133 --> 01:17:44,485
Before you tai,
I want to know why.

665
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:48,049
I need your powers
for Pool.

666
01:17:48,084 --> 01:17:49,832
What?

667
01:17:49,833 --> 01:17:53,088
Devil and the mutant.
Deadpool.

668
01:17:53,912 --> 01:17:57,704
Years of research, to find
appropriate powers

669
01:17:57,739 --> 01:18:02,443
that may exist together in the same body
not to destroy it.

670
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:07,422
My son was the first piece of the puzzle.

671
01:18:08,209 --> 01:18:10,216
Logan, you are last.

672
01:18:10,650 --> 01:18:12,897
You are the weapon XI.

673
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:20,972
You asked I would help,
but you wanted a life lines and Tita.

674
01:18:23,138 --> 01:18:29,138
I understand that nothing motivates him more
those of your family as revenge.

675
01:18:45,547 --> 01:18:47,547
Who are you?

676
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:50,624
It's an old friend.

677
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:05,939
You do not think
that we let you go I a. ..

678
01:19:05,974 --> 01:19:08,008
You are a dangerous man.

679
01:19:08,223 --> 01:19:10,911
I like watching them
people periculo and i.

680
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:13,311
Tell him about
they were dead.

681
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:22,637
He did an injection
hydrochloride with thiazides.

682
01:19:24,701 --> 01:19:28,524
I reduced so much fighting heart,
that makes you look dead.

683
01:19:40,269 --> 01:19:42,793
Do not be mad at her.

684
01:19:43,328 --> 01:19:46,699
It has done you proud species.

685
01:19:49,362 --> 01:19:53,483
I know that her sister
are the diamond-hard skin?

686
01:19:53,518 --> 01:19:57,078
Kayla power is based more
the tacto-hypnosis.

687
01:19:57,113 --> 01:20:00,126
Can influence people
only if they touch.

688
01:20:00,161 --> 01:20:02,879
A useful tool
seducþiei al.

689
01:20:03,093 --> 01:20:05,722
There was never really my friend.

690
01:20:10,452 --> 01:20:12,688
For me, it was true.

691
01:20:14,468 --> 01:20:17,740
I tell you that if you go down this road,
I'll you'll like what you found.

692
01:20:25,196 --> 01:20:27,331
Story that
I told her,

693
01:20:27,332 --> 01:20:30,775
about man
that collected for the month of flowers ...

694
01:20:31,925 --> 01:20:34,877
I understood a gre º it.

695
01:20:36,885 --> 01:20:40,451
I think you are the moon,
Bursuc and I am yours.

696
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:45,864
But you were Trickster, not to you?

697
01:20:46,086 --> 01:20:48,639
I am the only fool trick.

698
01:20:50,574 --> 01:20:54,122
The worst is
that I had to be realized.

699
01:20:56,678 --> 01:20:59,291
I knew in my instincts ...

700
01:21:02,215 --> 01:21:05,228
I knew what really.

701
01:21:09,464 --> 01:21:12,401
There'll never happen.

702
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,536
- Colonel.
- Not now, Kayla.

703
01:21:45,571 --> 01:21:48,352
I did everything you asked for.

704
01:21:49,514 --> 01:21:51,515
My sister ...

705
01:21:52,043 --> 01:21:54,808
You said that if you help
'll give him away.

706
01:21:55,029 --> 01:21:56,997
Not really so simple.

707
01:21:56,998 --> 01:21:59,946
Move is unique.
It's a beauty.

708
01:21:59,981 --> 01:22:02,153
We need more time just
to analyze, so everything.

709
01:22:02,188 --> 01:22:04,245
You let him go?

710
01:22:07,096 --> 01:22:09,515
- Victor, please.
- You can not to it, and go.

711
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:11,998
- I can win.
- Give me adamantiul.

712
01:22:12,033 --> 01:22:13,895
- Tests have ...
- I had an understanding.

713
01:22:13,896 --> 01:22:15,896
I'll survive and your operation.

714
01:22:17,983 --> 01:22:21,061
- Can any support and he can.
- I can not.

715
01:22:22,231 --> 01:22:26,078
You are my favorite soldier, Victor.
Be patient, one to come and the time ta.

716
01:22:26,113 --> 01:22:28,276
It uses the new.

717
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:40,560
What would you die for real
this time?

718
01:22:41,295 --> 01:22:43,295
Let me go.

719
01:22:45,378 --> 01:22:47,812
You have and effect on me.

720
01:22:48,225 --> 01:22:50,225
Victor!

721
01:23:23,683 --> 01:23:25,698
Are you well, not to you?

722
01:23:26,919 --> 01:23:29,058
All that anger ...

723
01:23:30,305 --> 01:23:31,927
Do it.

724
01:23:31,928 --> 01:23:33,928
Logan!

725
01:23:34,578 --> 01:23:36,947
No you're an animal.

726
01:23:36,982 --> 01:23:38,982
Yes you are.

727
01:23:42,213 --> 01:23:44,213
Do it.

728
01:23:47,441 --> 01:23:49,609
Ends.

729
01:24:13,566 --> 01:24:15,566
Logan?

730
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,184
My sister ...

731
01:24:20,185 --> 01:24:22,372
I have my sister.

732
01:24:22,771 --> 01:24:26,820
Please don 't fool
so I love you.

733
01:24:26,855 --> 01:24:29,625
And for me it was true.

734
01:24:31,011 --> 01:24:33,011
Please ...
I'm sorry.

735
01:24:33,028 --> 01:24:35,577
I have my sister.

736
01:24:36,009 --> 01:24:38,009
Where is it?

737
01:24:42,828 --> 01:24:45,889
- Activate Gun XI.
- The binding is not complete.

738
01:24:45,924 --> 01:24:46,919
Do it!

739
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,920
Now!

740
01:25:49,562 --> 01:25:51,562
You are okay? Come on.

741
01:26:41,559 --> 01:26:43,559
Well ...

742
01:26:43,611 --> 01:26:45,201
Perfect.

743
01:26:45,202 --> 01:26:47,162
- Kayla, get the kids here.
- Logan ...

744
01:26:47,163 --> 01:26:49,161
Find the other exit.

745
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:51,162
Haideþi. Let's go!

746
01:26:52,123 --> 01:26:54,123
Wade, you are?

747
01:26:57,764 --> 01:27:00,987
Stryker has finally found it in a way
you do not shut up.

748
01:27:11,746 --> 01:27:13,746
Wade ...

749
01:27:14,071 --> 01:27:16,071
Should not do that.

750
01:27:17,012 --> 01:27:19,012
Or maybe you should.

751
01:27:33,463 --> 01:27:35,463
Fire at will!

752
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:44,605
Can you help.
Take me closer.

753
01:27:44,606 --> 01:27:46,606
Go!

754
01:27:54,106 --> 01:27:56,106
Go! Now!

755
01:28:02,006 --> 01:28:03,611
I got you?

756
01:28:03,612 --> 01:28:05,612
Yes.

757
01:28:14,673 --> 01:28:16,241
- Come on.
- I can not come.

758
01:28:16,242 --> 01:28:17,509
Kayla, come on!

759
01:28:17,510 --> 01:28:19,164
You must remain here.

760
01:28:19,165 --> 01:28:21,165
You go with them.

761
01:28:21,586 --> 01:28:23,586
Go!

762
01:28:53,438 --> 01:28:55,260
Left.

763
01:28:55,261 --> 01:28:57,339
- What?
- Left.

764
01:28:57,374 --> 01:28:59,845
- You do not see.
- Trust me.

765
01:29:13,671 --> 01:29:16,045
Let's see
Height how to dance.

766
01:29:40,298 --> 01:29:42,298
DECAPITEAZÃ

767
01:29:54,014 --> 01:29:56,014
Do not kill anyone
besides me.

768
01:30:04,307 --> 01:30:06,307
Back-to-back!

769
01:30:07,646 --> 01:30:09,692
- I see.
- No.

770
01:31:46,245 --> 01:31:47,791
Stop it up!

771
01:31:47,792 --> 01:31:49,662
- It can not be that way.
- Yes, that's

772
01:31:49,663 --> 01:31:51,499
- How do you know?
- Simply know.

773
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:53,500
Come on.

774
01:32:03,566 --> 01:32:05,566
Gloanþe of adamantiu.

775
01:32:05,955 --> 01:32:09,326
Let's see how they'll survive
with his thick cãpãþâna.

776
01:32:09,361 --> 01:32:11,928
It can not stop.
Neither it.

777
01:32:11,963 --> 01:32:13,287
It will heal.

778
01:32:13,288 --> 01:32:15,484
The brain will heal.

779
01:32:16,814 --> 01:32:19,572
But memories will not be back.

780
01:32:35,846 --> 01:32:38,858
That does not change anything
relationship between us, Victor.

781
01:32:40,317 --> 01:32:41,791
I'm done.

782
01:32:41,792 --> 01:32:44,350
November I'll never finish, Jimmy.

783
01:32:44,385 --> 01:32:46,348
We fraþi.

784
01:32:46,349 --> 01:32:48,935
Fraþii they take care of each other.

785
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:24,300
- You to miss me?
- God ...

786
01:33:26,271 --> 01:33:30,484
When you say you'll kill everyone,
I thought that just overreacting.

787
01:33:31,608 --> 01:33:33,280
Come on up ...

788
01:33:33,281 --> 01:33:35,582
The guy who I seem to exaggerate?

789
01:33:35,617 --> 01:33:37,617
Your welcome.

790
01:33:44,435 --> 01:33:46,765
Some children try to go
on the island.

791
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,800
- We despãrþim. Go!
- Now.

792
01:34:09,649 --> 01:34:11,665
I love you.

793
01:34:19,231 --> 01:34:21,231
No ...

794
01:34:23,736 --> 01:34:25,545
I'm cold.

795
01:34:25,546 --> 01:34:28,246
Listen, you'll get here.

796
01:34:28,281 --> 01:34:30,168
- You understand?
- Yes.

797
01:34:30,169 --> 01:34:32,169
Slowly and with care.

798
01:34:36,773 --> 01:34:38,773
I can get better.

799
01:35:58,815 --> 01:36:01,459
You should make you
to water and on the trigger,

800
01:36:02,221 --> 01:36:04,396
but that he would not do better than you.

801
01:36:06,194 --> 01:36:08,194
Drop the gun.

802
01:36:13,303 --> 01:36:18,422
Go and never come off.

803
01:36:56,056 --> 01:36:58,360
<i> It'll be all right, Scott.</i>

804
01:36:58,395 --> 01:37:00,720
<i> My name is Charles Xavier.</i>

805
01:37:00,755 --> 01:37:03,011
<i> that I am a mutant and you.</i>

806
01:37:03,046 --> 01:37:07,557
<i> - I hear thoughts.
- Yes. And I hear them on yours.</i>

807
01:37:07,782 --> 01:37:10,029
You are safe now.

808
01:37:10,064 --> 01:37:12,276
<i> Veniþi. We gotta go.</i>

809
01:38:01,012 --> 01:38:03,012
Children are safe.

810
01:38:12,564 --> 01:38:15,559
- Who are you?
- How that is who I am?

811
01:38:15,909 --> 01:38:18,235
I'm the one who brought you here.
Now we gotta go.

812
01:38:19,575 --> 01:38:21,625
Where am I?

813
01:38:21,828 --> 01:38:24,221
Listen, I am your friend.

814
01:38:24,426 --> 01:38:25,693
Friend.

815
01:38:25,694 --> 01:38:27,371
What's my name?

816
01:38:27,372 --> 01:38:28,983
What's my name?

817
01:38:28,984 --> 01:38:31,192
Your name is Logan.

818
01:38:34,433 --> 01:38:37,152
Trust me.
We gotta go.

819
01:38:42,698 --> 01:38:44,698
Come after me.

820
01:38:48,688 --> 01:38:50,688
Now!

821
01:39:24,452 --> 01:39:26,452
I know you?

822
01:39:29,612 --> 01:39:31,612
No.

823
01:39:36,096 --> 01:39:40,196
I'll like what you did in this place.
We gotta go.

824
01:39:40,551 --> 01:39:42,632
I can handle myself.

825
01:39:47,385 --> 01:39:49,385
Good luck.

826
01:41:17,312 --> 01:41:19,312
Colonel Stryker?

827
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:26,657
- Colonel William Stryker?
- Yes.

828
01:41:28,032 --> 01:41:34,032
You searched for questioning
on the death of Gen. Munson.

829
01:46:31,733 --> 01:46:33,733
Canadian, I think.

830
01:46:41,134 --> 01:46:45,734
No, I am drinking to remember.

831
01:46:46,735 --> 01:46:49,935
