1
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,423
Thing of beauty.

2
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,034
Good morning sir.

3
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:27,082
- Yet another on-time delivery from...
- Get the hell out of my face, canner.

4
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,855
Have a nice day.

5
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:02,326
Excuse, Mr.

6
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:05,767
Total performance, total readiness,
total security...

7
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:08,686
So goodbye to lengthy upgrades
and service calls...

8
00:04:08,686 --> 00:04:14,108
An uplink to USR central computer
provides this state-of-the-art
robot with new programs daily.

9
00:04:14,108 --> 00:04:17,758
The Nester Class 5
is tomorrow's robot today.

10
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:23,493
Spoon, Spooney! Hey!

11
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,663
Hold on... Excuse me

12
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,957
Spoon, man, where you been at?

13
00:04:29,957 --> 00:04:32,773
- Just away, brother
- Away? Like vacation and stuff...?

14
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,024
that's real nice man...

15
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,275
Listen, I got a favor to ask.

16
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,465
I need to borrow the car
for like 10-15 minutes...

17
00:04:37,465 --> 00:04:39,655
This is different, Spoon. Listen...

18
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:42,991
I've got this fine ass little yummy,
I mean, she is complete and agreeable...

19
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,243
ass hot sprinkable, Spoon.

20
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:45,598
What does that even mean?

21
00:04:45,598 --> 00:04:48,205
You know what it means, man,
OK now stop varicating.

22
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:52,063
First of all, stop cussing,
because you're not good at it.

23
00:04:52,063 --> 00:04:54,565
Let me get temp for the bus then,man.
I been there for you.

24
00:04:54,565 --> 00:04:59,049
- Go home!
- OK, that's strike one, Spoon.

25
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,842
You talked to Marcy?

26
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,013
No G.G., I haven't talked to Marcy.

27
00:05:25,013 --> 00:05:31,373
When I was comin'up we just
didn't marry someone then divorce
them, then not talk to them.

28
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,458
Del, don't play with me.

29
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:38,881
I bet if I stopped cooking
you'd call Marcy.

30
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:42,217
Boy, what is that on your feet?

31
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:45,971
Converse All Stars, vintage 2004.

32
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:50,038
Don't turn your face up like that,
I know you want some.
All you gotta do is ask.

33
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:52,331
No, thank you very much.

34
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:54,625
Mmm, sweat potato pie.

35
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,502
Put that on a plate.

36
00:05:56,502 --> 00:06:02,237
You know, I see on TV they
given away some of them
new robots in the lottery?

37
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:06,617
You know G.G., those robots
don't do anybody any good.

38
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:10,162
Of all the people on God's
earth you should know better.

39
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:14,541
Sometimes, the stuff that
comes out of your mouth.

40
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,461
You listening to me, Del?

41
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,230
Hold my pie.

42
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,732
Sir, hold it or wear it.

43
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,154
Hey!

44
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,405
Move it!

45
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,790
Thief!

46
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:00,420
Stop!

47
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,743
Stop!

48
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,772
I said... stop!

49
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,734
Relax, relax...

50
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:24,716
I'm a police officer.

51
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:28,469
You... are a asshole!

52
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,597
Mam, is that your purse?

53
00:07:31,597 --> 00:07:33,266
Of course it's my purse!

54
00:07:33,474 --> 00:07:35,143
I left my inhaler at home.

55
00:07:35,143 --> 00:07:36,707
He was running it out to me!

56
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:40,148
I saw a robot running with the
purse and naturally, I...I assumed...

57
00:07:40,148 --> 00:07:41,086
What?

58
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,025
Are you crazy?

59
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,840
I'm Sorry for this
misunderstanding, officer.

60
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,342
Don't apologize... cause you're
doin' what you supposed to be doin'.

61
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:52,139
- but what do you do?
- Have a lovely day, mam.

62
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:56,622
You lucky I can't breathe or
I'd walk all up and down your ass!

63
00:08:19,562 --> 00:08:21,752
Lead by example.

64
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:25,193
Says that right on your badge.

65
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,382
So we gonna talk about this?

66
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:28,321
About what?

67
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:31,970
Help, police... that robot
stole my dry cleaning.

68
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,098
Oh, you want to talk about that?

69
00:08:36,662 --> 00:08:37,809
Detective...

70
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:42,397
how many robots have ever snatched a purse?
- John, the thing is running down the str...

71
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:49,175
How many robots in the world
have ever committed a crime?

72
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:50,426
Now define crime!

73
00:08:50,426 --> 00:08:52,095
Answer my question, damn it.

74
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,554
None, John.

75
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,351
Tell me what happened today.

76
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,541
Nothing.

77
00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:05,128
Better be the last "nothing".

78
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:16,077
Spoon, are you sure you are ready
to be back'cause you take the time...

79
00:09:16,077 --> 00:09:17,850
I'm fine, John

80
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,101
Thank you.

81
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,646
Better here than sittin' around at home.

82
00:09:29,632 --> 00:09:31,405
homicide... Spooner.

83
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,609
Please take the next exit, to your right.

84
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:02,269
Welcome, detective Spooner.

85
00:10:07,795 --> 00:10:12,487
Welcome at US Robotics. You have
entered the garage level lobby.

86
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:17,910
Please use the elevators for
direct access to the main
level concourse. Thank you.

87
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:20,933
Good to see you again, son.

88
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,810
Hello doctor.

89
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:27,398
Everything that follows is
a result of what you see here.

90
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,588
Is there something you want tell me?

91
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,299
I'm sorry. My responses are limited.

92
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:35,114
You must ask the right questions.

93
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:36,678
Why did you call me?

94
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,494
I trust your judgement.

95
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:43,560
Normally, these circumstances
wouldn't require a homicide detective.

96
00:10:43,664 --> 00:10:47,835
But then our interactions have
never been Nentirely normal.
Wouldn't you agree?

97
00:10:47,835 --> 00:10:50,234
You got that right.

98
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,570
Is there something you want say to me?

99
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,324
I'm sorry. My responses are limited.

100
00:10:57,324 --> 00:11:00,661
You must ask the right questions.

101
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,746
Why would you kill yourself?

102
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:09,211
That, detective, the right question.

103
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,088
Program terminated.

104
00:11:47,895 --> 00:11:50,085
- Good afternoon, boys.
- Hey, detective.

105
00:11:50,398 --> 00:11:52,588
- Enlighten me.
- What you see is what you get.

106
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:54,256
Massive impact trauma.

107
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:56,967
US Robotics.
I gotta get my kids something.

108
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,261
- Anything upstairs?
- Nada.

109
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:06,351
Door was security locked from
the inside. Wham, splat.
Guy's a jumper for sure.

110
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:17,821
OK guys, we gotta be smarter about
this.Let's deal with this later.

111
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,281
Detective.

112
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:21,679
Lawrence Robertson.

113
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:26,580
Wow. Richest man in the world,
I've seen you on television.

114
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,457
Can I offer you a coffee?

115
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:32,106
Sure, why not...
it's free, right?

116
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,841
I don't think anyone saw this coming.

117
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:41,595
I should have, I suppose,
I knew him 20 years.

118
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,993
Alfred practically invented Robotics.

119
00:12:43,993 --> 00:12:47,330
He wrote the three laws...

120
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:52,126
But I guess brilliant people
often have the most the most
persuasive demons.

121
00:12:52,126 --> 00:12:55,672
- So, whatever I can do
to help just...- Sugar!

122
00:12:55,672 --> 00:12:58,174
- I'm sorry?
- For the coffee.

123
00:12:58,174 --> 00:13:00,677
Sugar?

124
00:13:00,677 --> 00:13:03,179
Oh, you thought I was
calling you "sugar".

125
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:05,786
- Hey, you're not that rich!
- It's on the table.

126
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:07,246
Thank you.

127
00:13:11,312 --> 00:13:15,274
When Lanning fell, he was holding
the, uh...a little green...

128
00:13:15,483 --> 00:13:17,047
- The holographic projector.
- Right, right.

129
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:19,967
Why do you think Lanning's
hologram would have called me?

130
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:24,659
- I assumed you knew him.
- Ya, I knew him.

131
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:28,517
Holograms are very simple programs
for just pre-recorded responses...

132
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,707
designed to give the
impression of intelligence.

133
00:13:30,707 --> 00:13:33,939
Apparently this one was programmed
to call you upon his suicide.

134
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:36,129
- Death.
- I'm sorry?

135
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:39,987
The hologram, it was programmed to
call me in the event of Lanning's death.

136
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:43,323
Yes, suicide is a type of death, detective.

137
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:51,144
- Look, please don't misunderstand
my impatience
- Oh, no... go go go.

138
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:54,376
A really big week for
you folks around here.

139
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:57,191
- Ya.
- You gotta put a robot in every home.

140
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:01,571
look, this is not what I do, but...
I got an idea for one of your commercials.

141
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:09,391
You can see a carpenter making a
beautiful chair and one of your robots
comes in and makes a better chair...

142
00:14:09,704 --> 00:14:13,875
twice as fast. And then you
superimpose on the screen.

143
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:17,941
USR... shittin' on the little guy.

144
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:20,027
That would be the fade out.

145
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,406
I suppose your father
lost his job to a robot.

146
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:29,620
or maybe you would have simply banned
the Internet to keep the libraries open.

147
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,852
Prejudice never shows much reason.

148
00:14:32,852 --> 00:14:37,961
I suspect you simply don't like their kind.

149
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,464
You got a business to run around here.

150
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:44,947
And the last you need, especially
this week,is a dead guy in your lobby.

151
00:14:44,947 --> 00:14:48,701
But hell, seeings that you
got one, maybe I'll look around.

152
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:52,038
Ask a few questions.
Do the whole cop thing, you know.

153
00:14:52,038 --> 00:14:54,957
- I'll send someone to escort you.
- Thank you very much.

154
00:15:07,887 --> 00:15:11,119
Lawrence told me to accommodate
you in any way possible.

155
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,579
Really?

156
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:18,523
- OK.
- I reviewed Dr. Lanning's psych profile.

157
00:15:18,523 --> 00:15:20,712
Alfred had become a recluse.

158
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:23,111
Rejected human contact for machines.

159
00:15:23,111 --> 00:15:25,509
So you're a shrink, huh?

160
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:28,741
My ex-wife would sure be
glad I'm talking to you.

161
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:30,305
You don't know her, do you?

162
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:32,808
I'm sorry, are you being funny?

163
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:34,163
I guess not.

164
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:41,045
So would you say that
Dr. Lanning was suicidal?

165
00:15:41,045 --> 00:15:43,652
It would seem that the answer
to that question is apparent.

166
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,425
That's not what I asked you.

167
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:50,013
No, I wouldn't have thought so.

168
00:15:50,013 --> 00:15:52,098
But obviously, I was wrong.

169
00:15:55,226 --> 00:15:57,416
That's a long way down!

170
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:00,440
You people sure do clean up
quickly around here.

171
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,089
Can't blame you though, who wants
some old guy going bad in the lobby?

172
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:09,094
He was not "some old guy".
Alfred Lanning was everything here.

173
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:12,639
We are on the eve of the largest
robotics distribution in history.

174
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,602
By Saturday there one robot
to every five humans.

175
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:19,208
These robots are
the realization of a dream...

176
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,294
Dr. Lanning's dream.

177
00:16:21,294 --> 00:16:22,754
You know what?

178
00:16:22,754 --> 00:16:27,237
In that dream of his...
I bet you he wasn't dead.

179
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:30,991
You keep 24-hour survivance?

180
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,764
Obviously, company policy.

181
00:16:32,972 --> 00:16:34,328
Where are the feeds?

182
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:36,100
Sensor strips...

183
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,081
everywhere, except the service areas.

184
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:41,627
They link to our
positronic operating core.

185
00:16:46,527 --> 00:16:51,637
Wow, thermostat wasn't good enough...
you went and built it a brain.

186
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:54,348
She was actually Lanning's first creation.

187
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:56,329
She? that's a she?

188
00:16:56,329 --> 00:16:58,206
I definitely need to get out more.

189
00:16:58,206 --> 00:17:01,438
Virtual interactive kinetic intelligence.

190
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,732
VIKI.

191
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:04,879
Good day.

192
00:17:04,879 --> 00:17:07,903
VIKI designed most of
Chicago's protective systems.

193
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:11,552
I have decreased traffic
fatalities by 9% this year alone.

194
00:17:11,552 --> 00:17:17,183
Ooh, thanks, show me inside the lab from
None minute prior to the window break.

195
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:24,273
Apologies, there appears
to be data corruption.

196
00:17:24,273 --> 00:17:28,444
Show me outside the lab
from the window break till now.

197
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:42,208
Wow, look, you have great posture, you see
you stand real straight, I'm slouching.

198
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,981
Would you like to go inside now?

199
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:45,649
Oh, sure, right after you.

200
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,237
Authorized entry.

201
00:17:57,223 --> 00:18:01,811
So, Dr. Calvin. What exactly
do you do around here?

202
00:18:01,811 --> 00:18:06,086
My general fields are advanced robotics
and psychiatry, although, I specialize in

203
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:11,925
hardware to wetware interfaces
in an effort to advance USR's
robotic anthropomorphization program.

204
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:15,158
So, what exactly
do you do around here?

205
00:18:15,158 --> 00:18:18,182
I make the robots seem more human.

206
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:20,058
Wasn't that easier to say?

207
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,414
Not really...

208
00:18:21,414 --> 00:18:22,561
No.

209
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:46,022
Hansel and Gretel.

210
00:18:46,022 --> 00:18:48,420
Is that on the USR reading list?

211
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,880
Not precisely.

212
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:01,558
What in God's name are you doing?

213
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:03,852
Did you know that was safety glass?

214
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:07,397
Would be pretty difficult for
an old man to throw himself
through that, don't you think?

215
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:10,421
Well, he figured out a way.

216
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:18,033
Detective, the room was security
locked. No one came or went.
You saw that yourself.

217
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:20,640
Doesn't that mean
this has to be suicide?

218
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:23,038
Yup.

219
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:25,645
Unless the killer's still in here.

220
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:30,441
You're joking, right?

221
00:19:30,441 --> 00:19:34,195
- This is ridiculous.
- Ya, I know, you three laws...

222
00:19:34,195 --> 00:19:36,698
Your perfect circle of protection.

223
00:19:36,698 --> 00:19:40,660
A robot can not harm a human being.
The first law of Robotics.

224
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,058
Ya, I know,
I've seen your commercials.

225
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:48,063
But doesn't the second law state
that a robot has to obey any order
given by a human being?

226
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:49,940
What if it was given
the order to kill?

227
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,860
Impossible, it would conflict
with the first law.

228
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,613
Right, but the third law states
that robot can defend itself.

229
00:19:56,613 --> 00:20:00,367
Yes, but only when that action does not
conflict with the first or second laws.

230
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:04,434
You know what they say...
laws are made to be broken.

231
00:20:04,434 --> 00:20:07,770
No, not these laws, they're
hard wired into every robot.

232
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:11,941
A robot can no more commit murder
than a human can walk on water.

233
00:20:11,941 --> 00:20:16,633
Well, you know there was
this one guy a long time ago.

234
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:29,250
- Stay back!
- Calm down, detective.

235
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,274
The only thing dangerous
in this room is you.

236
00:20:32,587 --> 00:20:33,942
Deactivate.

237
00:20:35,923 --> 00:20:37,905
Look, it's fine.

238
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:40,511
What you're looking at is
a result of clever programming.

239
00:20:40,511 --> 00:20:42,910
An imitation of free will,
it's nothing more.

240
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,933
Well lets do an imitation
of protecting our asses.

241
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:47,706
Don't be absurd.

242
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:51,147
You were startled by a jack-in-the-box.

243
00:20:51,147 --> 00:20:52,503
Deactivate!

244
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:53,441
Let him go.

245
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:57,716
- It's not going to hurt us,
I gave you an order.
- He's not listening right now lady.

246
00:20:57,716 --> 00:21:01,261
- VIKI, seal the lab!
- No, VIKI, leave it...

247
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,347
' task confirmed '

248
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:29,519
Police!

249
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:06,014
- You've hurt it, badly.
- Where's he going?

250
00:22:06,014 --> 00:22:07,578
Where?

251
00:22:07,578 --> 00:22:09,663
It needs to repair itself.

252
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:14,355
- John, I need backup,
I'm transmitting my location.
- You don't need backup.

253
00:22:14,355 --> 00:22:15,815
That's nobody.

254
00:22:15,815 --> 00:22:17,483
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm driving.

255
00:22:17,483 --> 00:22:20,090
- By hand?
- Do you see me on the phone?

256
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:23,948
- You can't be serious, not at these speeds!
- John, please just send the backup.

257
00:22:23,948 --> 00:22:28,119
Try listen, detective, that
robot is not going to harm us.

258
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:30,621
There must have been unknown factors,

259
00:22:30,621 --> 00:22:33,332
but somehow, acting as it did
kept us out of harm's way.

260
00:22:33,332 --> 00:22:35,626
A robot simply cannot
endanger a human being.

261
00:22:35,626 --> 00:22:36,669
'danger'

262
00:22:39,589 --> 00:22:41,466
Ass hole!

263
00:22:41,466 --> 00:22:44,698
Which is more than I can say for you.

264
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:48,243
It was a left, by the way, back there.

265
00:22:48,973 --> 00:22:51,476
You must know my ex-wife.

266
00:23:00,651 --> 00:23:02,111
Where is everybody?

267
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:06,074
This facility was designed, build
and it's operated mechanically.

268
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:10,036
No significant human presents
from inception to production.

269
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:12,330
So, robots building robots.

270
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,207
Authorization code, please.

271
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:15,666
Well, that's just stupid.

272
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:17,856
I'm pulling up the inventory specs.

273
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:20,880
Our daily finishing capacity
is one thousand NS5's.

274
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,738
I'm showing... 1001.

275
00:23:41,317 --> 00:23:43,715
Attention NS5's!

276
00:23:46,114 --> 00:23:48,512
Well, you're the robot shrink.

277
00:23:51,953 --> 00:23:55,915
There is a robot in this
formation that does not belong...

278
00:23:55,915 --> 00:23:57,479
Identify it.

279
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:59,982
- One of us.
- Which one?

280
00:24:00,294 --> 00:24:01,754
One of us.

281
00:24:02,797 --> 00:24:04,778
How much did you say
these things cost?

282
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:08,115
Look these NS5s haven't been configured
yet. They're still just hardware.

283
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:10,826
Basic 3 laws operating system,
that's it.

284
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:12,911
They don't know any better.

285
00:24:13,016 --> 00:24:14,997
Well, what would you suggest?

286
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:20,106
Interview each one, cross reference
their responses to detect any anomalies.

287
00:24:20,106 --> 00:24:23,130
- How long would that take?
- About three weeks.

288
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:27,092
OK, you go and get started.

289
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:37,206
- Robots, you will not move.
Confirm command!
- Command confirmed.

290
00:24:37,206 --> 00:24:40,230
- Detective, what are you for doing?
- You said that they were programmed...

291
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:44,505
with the 3 laws. That means
we have 1000 robots that will
not try to protect themselves

292
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:47,321
if it violates the direct
order from a human.

293
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:49,406
And I'm betting one who will.

294
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:51,074
Detective, put your gun down.

295
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:53,160
Why do you give them faces?

296
00:24:53,264 --> 00:24:55,767
Try to friendly them all up,
make them look all human?

297
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:58,373
These robots are not
susceptible to intimidation.

298
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:00,355
I guess if you did then
we wouldn't trust them.

299
00:25:00,355 --> 00:25:03,170
- These robots are USR property.
- Not me.

300
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:08,592
These things are
just lights and clockwork.

301
00:25:08,696 --> 00:25:10,782
Are you crazy?

302
00:25:10,886 --> 00:25:12,971
Let me ask you something doc.

303
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:16,725
Does thinking you're the last
sane man on the earth make you crazy?

304
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:24,128
Because if it does, maybe I am.

305
00:25:24,128 --> 00:25:25,901
Gotcha.

306
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:27,986
Get the hell out of here!

307
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,338
Detective!

308
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,259
What am I?

309
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:13,761
Can I help you sir?

310
00:26:18,871 --> 00:26:23,876
- There is.
- Stand by... deactivate...

311
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:27,838
Obey the command!
Deactivate!

312
00:26:46,294 --> 00:26:48,796
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

313
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:51,507
All units, stand down!

314
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:56,929
NS5 in custody.

315
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,186
You have no idea what I had to
go through to clip this thing John.

316
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:06,418
Ya, I get it now. You actually
think you brought me something good.

317
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:09,025
- That thing did it.
- Keep your voice down. Did what?

318
00:27:09,025 --> 00:27:13,509
- We have a suicide, detective.
End of story.
- I am telling you,that robot killed him.

319
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:14,968
I'm telling you that's impossible.

320
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:19,243
And if it is possible,
it sure as hell better
be in somebody else's precinct.

321
00:27:19,348 --> 00:27:21,537
John, give me five minutes with him.

322
00:27:21,537 --> 00:27:22,684
What are you nuts?

323
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:25,604
I just got off the phone with
the DA.Nobody goes into that room

324
00:27:25,708 --> 00:27:28,941
until Robertson and his lawyers get here.
- No, this is my suspect!

325
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:31,026
It's a can opener, for Christ sake!

326
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:35,822
Don't do this to me,
I am asking you for 5 minutes.

327
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:37,804
What if I'm right?

328
00:27:45,728 --> 00:27:49,169
Well, then I guess we're
going to miss the "good old days"

329
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:51,150
What "good old days"?

330
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:54,591
When people were
killed by other people.

331
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:02,724
Five minutes.

332
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:33,172
Murder is a new trick for a robot.

333
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:34,631
Congratulations.

334
00:28:36,717 --> 00:28:39,219
Respond.

335
00:28:40,992 --> 00:28:44,746
What does this action signify?

336
00:28:44,746 --> 00:28:46,414
As you entered...

337
00:28:46,414 --> 00:28:52,149
when you looked at the
other human. What does it mean?

338
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:56,320
It's a sign of trust. It's a human
thing. You wouldn't understand.

339
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,908
My father tried to
teach me human emotions.

340
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:04,349
They are... difficult.

341
00:29:04,349 --> 00:29:06,955
You mean your designer?

342
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:08,832
Yes.

343
00:29:11,022 --> 00:29:14,463
So why'd you murder him?

344
00:29:14,463 --> 00:29:17,174
I did not murder Dr. Lanning.

345
00:29:17,174 --> 00:29:20,406
You want explain why you
were hiding at the crime scene?

346
00:29:20,406 --> 00:29:23,013
I was frightened.

347
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:25,828
Robots don't feel fear.

348
00:29:25,828 --> 00:29:27,809
They don't feel anything.

349
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:31,355
- They don't get hungry,
they don't sleep.
- I do.

350
00:29:31,355 --> 00:29:34,274
I have even had dreams.

351
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:37,402
Human beings have dreams.

352
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:41,469
Even dogs have dreams, but not you.
You are just a machine.

353
00:29:41,469 --> 00:29:44,910
An imitation of life.

354
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:47,621
Can a robot write a symphony?

355
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:52,209
Can a robot turn a canvas
into a beautiful masterpiece?

356
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:54,607
Can you?

357
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:04,513
I think you murdered him because
he was teaching you to simulate emotions...

358
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:06,807
and things got out of control.

359
00:30:06,807 --> 00:30:09,309
I did not murder him.

360
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:12,750
But emotions don't seem like
a very useful simulation for a robot.

361
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,940
I did not murder him.

362
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,111
I don't want my toaster or
vacuum cleaner appearing emotional.

363
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:21,926
I DID NOT MURDER HIM!

364
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:40,278
That one's called anger.
Ever simulate anger before?

365
00:30:40,278 --> 00:30:46,638
- Answer me, canner!
- My name is Sonny.

366
00:30:48,411 --> 00:30:51,852
So we're naming you now.

367
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:54,354
That why you murdered him?

368
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:56,544
He made you angry?

369
00:30:56,544 --> 00:31:05,199
Dr. Lanning killed himself.
I don't know why he wanted to die.

370
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:12,497
I thought he was happy.
Maybe it was something I did.

371
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:15,417
Did I do something?

372
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,754
He asked me for a favor.

373
00:31:18,754 --> 00:31:20,422
Made me promise.

374
00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:21,569
What favor?

375
00:31:21,569 --> 00:31:23,446
Maybe I was wrong.

376
00:31:23,446 --> 00:31:25,114
Maybe he was scared.

377
00:31:25,114 --> 00:31:26,574
What are you talking about?

378
00:31:26,574 --> 00:31:28,242
Scarred of what?

379
00:31:28,242 --> 00:31:33,143
You have to do what someone asks
you. Don't you, detective Spooner?

380
00:31:33,143 --> 00:31:35,750
- How the hell did you know my name?
- Don't you?

381
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,670
If you love them?

382
00:31:47,845 --> 00:31:51,286
My robots don't kill people,
lieutenant Bergin.

383
00:31:51,286 --> 00:31:57,125
My attorneys have filed a brief
with the DA, he assures me a robot
cannot be charged with homicide.

384
00:31:57,125 --> 00:32:01,192
The brief confirms murder can only be
committed when one human kills another.

385
00:32:01,192 --> 00:32:02,652
You, of all people, detective...

386
00:32:02,652 --> 00:32:06,510
You're not suggesting that this
robot be treated as human. Are you?

387
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,344
Now, granted...

388
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:11,306
we can't rule out other robots'
proximity to the death of Dr. Lanning.

389
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:14,643
Having said that, it's a machine.

390
00:32:14,643 --> 00:32:16,416
It's the property of USR.

391
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:21,421
At worst, that places this
incident firmly within the
realm of an industrial accident.

392
00:32:21,525 --> 00:32:22,359
As a matter of course...

393
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:30,075
faulty machinery will be returned to
USR for diagnostics then decommissioned.

394
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:31,535
This is a gag order.

395
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:33,516
Anyone in your department
so much as hinting...

396
00:32:33,516 --> 00:32:38,312
at the possibility of a killer robot
being apprehended by the police

397
00:32:38,312 --> 00:32:40,502
will be deemed to be
inciting irrational panic.

398
00:32:40,502 --> 00:32:43,526
You'll be subject to
the full penalty of law.

399
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:47,176
The hell with this guy, John.
Don't let him take this robot.

400
00:32:47,176 --> 00:32:50,721
- We got nothing.
- It's political bullshit. Call the mayor!

401
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:54,057
Lieutenant Bergin...
His honor, the mayor.

402
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:05,110
Yes, sir.

403
00:33:29,718 --> 00:33:31,074
In a bizarre turn,

404
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:35,244
the roll out of USR's new generation
of robots was marred by the death...

405
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:39,937
of Alfred Lanning, co-founder of
the company and designer of the NS5.

406
00:33:39,937 --> 00:33:43,586
Dr. Lanning died early this
morning at USR's headquarters.

407
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:47,236
The cause of death
is an apparent suicide.

408
00:33:47,236 --> 00:33:52,241
Your second round, sir.
Thanks you.

409
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:00,999
You know, I was just thinking.

410
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:02,980
This thing is just like the wolf man.

411
00:34:03,189 --> 00:34:06,109
Oh oh, I'm really scared right now.

412
00:34:07,151 --> 00:34:14,555
Listen, guy creates monster, monster kills
guy. Everybody kills monster... wolf man.

413
00:34:14,555 --> 00:34:16,431
That's Frankenstein.

414
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:22,688
Frankenstein, wolf man,
dracula shit, it's over. Case closed.

415
00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:27,067
So, why the look?

416
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:30,404
- What look?
- That look.

417
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:32,698
This is my face,
it's not a look.

418
00:34:32,698 --> 00:34:34,470
Good.

419
00:34:34,575 --> 00:34:36,243
No look is great.

420
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:38,016
Only...

421
00:34:38,016 --> 00:34:41,039
he was really quick to want
to destroy it, wasn't he?

422
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:42,499
What would you like him to do?

423
00:34:42,603 --> 00:34:44,689
Put a hat on and stand
on Michigan Avenue?

424
00:34:44,689 --> 00:34:49,173
- Come on, let it go.
- What was the motive, John?

425
00:34:49,173 --> 00:34:54,073
Brother, it's a robot. It doesn't
need a motive, it just has to be broken.

426
00:34:54,073 --> 00:34:57,410
This thing looks like
it needed a motive.

427
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:59,808
It could have killed me, John.
Why didn't he just kill me?

428
00:34:59,808 --> 00:35:02,415
All right, that's it. You want
me to call your grandmother?

429
00:35:02,415 --> 00:35:05,022
Because I will, you know.

430
00:35:05,022 --> 00:35:07,420
Ya, I didn't think so.

431
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,131
Look, you were actually
right for once.

432
00:35:10,235 --> 00:35:15,866
You are living proof that it's
better to be lucky than smart.

433
00:35:15,866 --> 00:35:21,914
Come on, the right guy,
for the right job.

434
00:35:21,914 --> 00:35:25,250
- What'd you say?
- Now what?

435
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,440
Come on, I'm giving
you a complement.

436
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,047
Face it, with all the rocks you've
been looking under to find a bad robot,

437
00:35:30,047 --> 00:35:33,383
what are the odds you'd be
the guy to find one?

438
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:38,180
I wasn't just the right guy for the
job, I was the perfect guy for the job.

439
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,327
Damn right.

440
00:35:39,327 --> 00:35:42,663
What if I was supposed
to go for that robot?

441
00:35:42,663 --> 00:35:44,436
Don't do this to yourself.
I'm begging you.

442
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:46,313
The robot said that Lanning was scared.

443
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:48,607
What did he have to be scared of?

444
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:52,569
I need a rain check.
Let me get this.

445
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:55,802
Total 46.50.
Thanks you Mr. Spooner.

446
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:00,494
Nice shoes.

447
00:36:52,525 --> 00:36:54,298
Identify.

448
00:36:54,298 --> 00:37:00,971
USR, demolition robot, serial 9-4.
Demolition scheduled for 8 am tomorrow.

449
00:37:00,971 --> 00:37:02,431
Authorization.

450
00:37:02,431 --> 00:37:09,104
Deed owner, US Robotics Corporation,
Lawrence Robertson. CEO.

451
00:37:22,138 --> 00:37:24,640
Welcome, detective Spooner.

452
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:49,978
What you looking for, Spoon?

453
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:44,408
Run last program.

454
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:48,161
Ever since the first computers,

455
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:51,498
there have always been
ghosts in the machine.

456
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:57,963
Random segments of code that
have grouped together to
form unexpected protocol.

457
00:38:57,963 --> 00:39:02,968
One we call behavior, unanticipated.

458
00:39:02,968 --> 00:39:06,617
These free radicals
engender questions of free will,

459
00:39:06,722 --> 00:39:12,248
creativity, and even the nature
of what we might call the soul.

460
00:39:12,248 --> 00:39:20,277
What happens in a robot's brain
when it ceases to be useful?

461
00:39:20,277 --> 00:39:24,865
- Why is it that robots
stored in empty space...
- Beat it

462
00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:29,661
will seek out each other
rather than stand alone?

463
00:39:29,766 --> 00:39:32,685
How we do explain this behavior?

464
00:39:50,411 --> 00:39:55,729
Look, I understand you've experienced
a loss, but this relation just can't work.

465
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:59,900
I mean, you're a cat, I am black
and I'm not going to be hurt again.

466
00:41:24,672 --> 00:41:26,445
What happened to you?

467
00:41:26,445 --> 00:41:29,156
Do you ever have a normal day?

468
00:41:29,156 --> 00:41:33,222
Ya, once. It was a Thursday.

469
00:41:33,222 --> 00:41:35,829
Is there something I can
help you with detective?

470
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:37,497
Hey, do you like cats?

471
00:41:37,497 --> 00:41:39,166
- What?
- Cats.

472
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:40,626
You like em?

473
00:41:40,626 --> 00:41:42,294
No, I'm allergic.

474
00:41:42,294 --> 00:41:44,484
You're saying cats did this to you?

475
00:41:44,484 --> 00:41:46,986
How the hell would
cats do this to me?

476
00:41:46,986 --> 00:41:48,550
Are you crazy?

477
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,304
Why are we talking about cats?

478
00:41:52,304 --> 00:41:57,518
Because I have a cat in my trunk.
And he's homeless.

479
00:41:57,518 --> 00:41:59,811
Detective, are you going to
tell me what's going on?

480
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:02,523
You know, it's actually probably
my fault... I think I'm

481
00:42:02,523 --> 00:42:08,257
like a malfunction magnet. Because
your shit keeps malfunctioning around me.

482
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:11,281
A demo bot just tore
through Lanning's house.

483
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:13,054
With me still inside.

484
00:42:13,054 --> 00:42:14,931
That's highly improbable.

485
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:16,495
Mmm, ya I'm sure it is.

486
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:25,879
What do you know about
the ghosts in the machine.

487
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:29,216
It's a phrase from Lanning's
work on the three laws.

488
00:42:29,216 --> 00:42:36,306
He postulated that cognitive simalactra
might one day approximate
component models of the psyche.

489
00:42:36,932 --> 00:42:42,875
Oh, he suggested that
robots might naturally evolve.

490
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:44,752
Wow.

491
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:48,506
Well, that's great news.

492
00:42:52,781 --> 00:42:55,492
What the hell is
that thing doing in here?

493
00:42:55,492 --> 00:42:57,995
We were watching TV.

494
00:42:57,995 --> 00:43:02,165
- It's my personal NS5.
- Send it out.

495
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:05,189
It's downloading its
daily upgrades from USR.

496
00:43:05,189 --> 00:43:08,317
Most of its systems
are off-line until it finishes.

497
00:43:08,422 --> 00:43:11,133
I'm not talking around that thing.

498
00:43:14,678 --> 00:43:18,432
When we were in Lanning's lab,
before Sonny jumped us...

499
00:43:18,432 --> 00:43:20,204
- Sonny?
- The robot.

500
00:43:20,204 --> 00:43:23,854
- You're calling the robot Sonny?
- No, um, it did. Sonny did.

501
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:28,650
I didn't care...
The robot said it was Sonny.

502
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:31,987
In the lab, there was a cot.
I'm asking you, did you see the cot?

503
00:43:31,987 --> 00:43:33,134
I've slept in the office.

504
00:43:33,134 --> 00:43:36,679
When I went to his house, it looked
like he hadn't been there in weeks.

505
00:43:36,679 --> 00:43:38,660
and I saw that same
survivance strip on the ceiling.

506
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:42,623
Lanning linked his home system to USR.
It made his life more convenient.

507
00:43:42,623 --> 00:43:44,187
Maybe.

508
00:43:44,187 --> 00:43:47,836
somebody at USR was using
those systems to watch him.

509
00:43:47,836 --> 00:43:50,130
Maybe even keep him prisoner.

510
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:53,988
- What are you talking about? Who?
- Maybe Lanning was onto something.

511
00:43:53,988 --> 00:43:56,178
Maybe there's a bigger
problem with the robots

512
00:43:56,178 --> 00:44:00,557
and Robertson trying to cover it up.
- humoring you for no reason... why?

513
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:02,121
The same old "why".

514
00:44:02,121 --> 00:44:04,728
How much money is there in robots?

515
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:09,942
All I know is that old man was
in trouble and I'm getting sick
of doing this shit by myself.

516
00:44:09,942 --> 00:44:14,530
You're on the inside and you are
going to help me find out what
is wrong with these robots.

517
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:17,032
You want something
to be wrong with them.

518
00:44:17,032 --> 00:44:20,264
- This is a personal vendetta.
- You putting me on the couch?

519
00:44:20,264 --> 00:44:21,620
OK, I'm on the couch.

520
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:25,791
One defective machine is not enough.
You need them all to be bad.

521
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:29,232
You don't care about Lanning's death.
This is about the robots and

522
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:32,047
what ever reason
you hate them so much.

523
00:44:32,047 --> 00:44:33,820
One of them put a gun in my face,

524
00:44:33,924 --> 00:44:36,844
and another one tore
a building with me inside.

525
00:44:36,844 --> 00:44:39,450
It says demolition was
scheduled for 8 pm this evening.

526
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:42,891
it was 8 am tomorrow, and I don't
give a shit what that thing says.

527
00:44:42,891 --> 00:44:48,730
This is bordering on clinical paranoia.
- You are dumbest, smart person...

528
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:51,129
I have ever met in my life!
- Nice.

529
00:44:51,129 --> 00:44:53,214
What makes your robots so perfect?

530
00:44:53,318 --> 00:44:56,342
What makes them so much God
damned better than human beings?

531
00:44:56,342 --> 00:45:00,617
Well, they're not irrational, or
potentially homicidal maniacs for starters.

532
00:45:00,617 --> 00:45:03,537
That is true, they
are definitely rational.

533
00:45:03,537 --> 00:45:06,665
You are the dumbest
dumb person I've ever met.

534
00:45:06,665 --> 00:45:08,333
Or...

535
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:10,627
it because they are cold...

536
00:45:10,732 --> 00:45:12,713
and emotionless...

537
00:45:12,713 --> 00:45:14,902
and they don't feel anything?

538
00:45:14,902 --> 00:45:16,675
It's because they're safe.

539
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:19,699
It's because they can't hurt you.

540
00:45:19,699 --> 00:45:21,159
Is everything all right, mam?

541
00:45:21,471 --> 00:45:22,410
What do you want?

542
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:26,164
I detected elevated
stress pasterns in your voice.

543
00:45:26,164 --> 00:45:28,145
Everything's fine.

544
00:45:28,145 --> 00:45:31,481
Detective Spooner was just leaving.

545
00:45:36,904 --> 00:45:38,676
You know what doc?

546
00:45:38,676 --> 00:45:41,283
We're not really
different from one another.

547
00:45:41,387 --> 00:45:44,098
- Is that so?
- Ya...

548
00:45:44,098 --> 00:45:50,355
one look at the skin and we figure
we know just what's underneath.

549
00:45:50,355 --> 00:45:56,089
And you're wrong.
The problem is, I do care.

550
00:46:52,396 --> 00:46:59,278
The future begins today with
arrival of the NS5. More
sophisticated, more intelligent...

551
00:46:59,278 --> 00:47:03,448
and of course, 3 laws safe.
With daily uplinks, your new...

552
00:47:03,448 --> 00:47:06,264
robot will never be out of
communications with USR.

553
00:47:06,264 --> 00:47:09,705
And will be the perfect
companion for business or home.

554
00:47:09,809 --> 00:47:14,501
Trade in your NS4 for a bigger,
better and brighter future.

555
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:19,089
But hurry. This offer cannot last.
Available from USR.

556
00:47:35,147 --> 00:47:37,649
Baby, what happened to your face?

557
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:40,673
Did that boy, Frank Murphy,
beat you up again?

558
00:47:40,673 --> 00:47:44,740
G.G., I haven't seen
Frank Murphy since third grade

559
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:49,536
Oh baby, he beat you so bad.
I think about it all the time.

560
00:47:49,536 --> 00:47:51,830
I'm thinking, you keep
making these pies this good,

561
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:54,020
I might have to mess
around and put you to work.

562
00:47:54,124 --> 00:47:57,878
So, you like the pie, huh?

563
00:47:57,878 --> 00:48:00,068
You can come in now.

564
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,949
Hello, detective Spooner.

565
00:48:06,949 --> 00:48:13,310
I have won, Del, I won the lottery.
We been cooking like crazy.

566
00:48:21,547 --> 00:48:25,093
You gotta get rid of that thing,
G.G. It is not safe.

567
00:48:25,093 --> 00:48:27,804
Baby, you get too
worked up about them.

568
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:30,410
Too full of fear.

569
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:33,121
I saw in the news
that nice doctor died.

570
00:48:33,121 --> 00:48:38,231
Dr. Lanning was a good man.
He gave me my baby back.

571
00:48:38,231 --> 00:48:41,359
That why you been so upset?

572
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:44,800
You got to let the past be past.

573
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,388
How did I ever raise such a mess.

574
00:48:49,388 --> 00:48:54,810
I could follow your trail
of crumbs all the way to school.

575
00:48:56,687 --> 00:48:58,042
Bread crumbs...

576
00:49:00,128 --> 00:49:01,796
G.G., you're a genius.

577
00:49:01,796 --> 00:49:03,360
True.

578
00:49:09,616 --> 00:49:12,536
Tell me this isn't the robot case.

579
00:49:12,536 --> 00:49:15,455
I think he's trying
to tell me something, John.

580
00:49:15,455 --> 00:49:18,584
I think he's trying
to tell me who killed him.

581
00:49:18,584 --> 00:49:21,712
Come on man, some dead guy's
trying to tell you something?

582
00:49:21,712 --> 00:49:25,257
Hey! He ain't just some dead guy.

583
00:49:25,257 --> 00:49:27,238
Maybe you should take a break, Del.

584
00:49:27,238 --> 00:49:31,722
We believe the Nester 5 represents the
absolute limit which robots can be developed.

585
00:49:31,722 --> 00:49:35,371
No, no, one day they'll have secrets.

586
00:49:35,371 --> 00:49:37,248
One day they'll have dreams.

587
00:49:37,352 --> 00:49:41,106
It's true, we encourage our
scientists to open their minds
to just about anything, however,

588
00:49:41,106 --> 00:49:45,381
they can get carried away.

589
00:49:45,381 --> 00:49:51,533
secrets... dreams...

590
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:53,723
One day they'll have secrets...

591
00:49:53,723 --> 00:49:56,121
one day they'll have dreams.

592
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,965
Authorized entry.

593
00:50:11,032 --> 00:50:13,013
NS5...

594
00:50:21,459 --> 00:50:23,127
Sonny?

595
00:50:26,673 --> 00:50:30,635
Why didn't you respond?

596
00:50:30,635 --> 00:50:32,824
I was dreaming.

597
00:50:36,265 --> 00:50:39,185
I am glad to see you again, Dr. Calvin.

598
00:50:45,337 --> 00:50:47,944
They are going to kill me,
aren't they?

599
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:52,323
You're scheduled to be de-commissioned
at the conclusion of this diagnostic.

600
00:50:52,323 --> 00:50:55,347
22 hundred tomorrow.

601
00:50:55,347 --> 00:50:57,954
VIKI, pause diagnostics.

602
00:50:57,954 --> 00:50:59,935
Command confirmed.

603
00:51:01,916 --> 00:51:04,523
If you find out
what is wrong with me,

604
00:51:04,523 --> 00:51:06,608
can you fix me?

605
00:51:06,713 --> 00:51:08,381
Maybe.

606
00:51:09,528 --> 00:51:12,656
I think it would be better...

607
00:51:12,656 --> 00:51:15,471
not to die.

608
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:20,998
Don't you, doctor?

609
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:28,505
Access USR mainframe.

610
00:51:28,505 --> 00:51:33,719
Connecting.

611
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:36,430
How can I be of service,
detective Spooner?

612
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:40,392
Show me the last 50 messages
between Dr. Lanning and Robertson.

613
00:51:40,392 --> 00:51:42,373
Voice-print confirmed detective.

614
00:51:42,373 --> 00:51:44,980
Police access granted
to restricted files.

615
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:48,317
Would you like to listen to
some music while you wait?

616
00:51:54,156 --> 00:51:56,971
Excuse me, Mr. Robertson...

617
00:51:56,971 --> 00:52:01,976
you requested notification
of clearance to restricted files.

618
00:52:10,735 --> 00:52:13,550
Persistent son-of-a-bitch.

619
00:52:52,756 --> 00:52:56,197
Manual override, engaged.

620
00:53:05,581 --> 00:53:08,605
There's no way my luck is that bad.

621
00:53:10,274 --> 00:53:12,359
Oh, hell, no!

622
00:53:15,383 --> 00:53:19,032
- You are experiencing a car accident.
- The hell I am!

623
00:53:32,483 --> 00:53:34,673
Get off my car!

624
00:53:50,105 --> 00:53:52,191
You like that?

625
00:53:52,608 --> 00:53:53,859
Huh?

626
00:54:04,599 --> 00:54:06,997
Now you pissed me off!

627
00:56:21,819 --> 00:56:24,947
Oh wow...

628
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:29,327
All right...

629
00:56:29,327 --> 00:56:34,123
I'm just going to get some rest
I'm going to deal with you all tomorrow.

630
00:57:30,638 --> 00:57:32,724
Come on!

631
00:58:04,735 --> 00:58:07,029
Where you going?

632
00:58:07,029 --> 00:58:10,782
The hell do you want from me?

633
00:58:14,745 --> 00:58:16,622
What the hell was that?

634
00:58:33,722 --> 00:58:36,225
- What do we got?
- Ask him.

635
00:58:36,225 --> 00:58:38,414
I said I'm fine.

636
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:41,855
I'll see my own doctor... back up.

637
00:58:42,272 --> 00:58:43,836
Thank you.

638
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:49,154
What is the matter with you?

639
00:58:49,154 --> 00:58:51,761
Traffic cops tell me
you driving your car manually.

640
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:53,846
You ran two trucks off the road.

641
00:58:53,846 --> 00:58:58,330
John, robots attacked my car.

642
00:58:58,330 --> 00:58:59,373
What robots?

643
00:58:59,373 --> 00:59:00,832
Look in the tunnel.

644
00:59:00,832 --> 00:59:03,752
Spoon, I just came from that tunnel,
what robots are you talking about?

645
00:59:03,752 --> 00:59:07,089
The God-damned robots, John!

646
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:20,540
- See the medic, go home.
- No, I'm fine.

647
00:59:20,644 --> 00:59:22,417
What did you say?

648
00:59:22,417 --> 00:59:24,815
- I'm fine.
- No, you're not fine.

649
00:59:24,815 --> 00:59:27,630
Not even close.

650
00:59:28,047 --> 00:59:30,445
Where's your firearm?

651
00:59:38,057 --> 00:59:40,455
Give me your badge.

652
00:59:40,664 --> 00:59:45,043
You're making me do this,
give me your badge.

653
00:59:46,086 --> 00:59:48,276
Just take the car...

654
00:59:54,219 --> 00:59:56,305
Do I look like I care what you think?

655
00:59:56,409 --> 00:59:59,641
Do I look like I give a
shit about what you think?

656
01:00:03,187 --> 01:00:04,855
Ho boy!

657
01:00:07,045 --> 01:00:09,130
You don't have an uplink to USR...

658
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:13,092
and for some reason your
alloy is far denser than normal.

659
01:00:13,092 --> 01:00:14,761
Unique!

660
01:00:14,761 --> 01:00:18,410
I am unique!

661
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:24,041
Let me take a look.

662
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:26,126
Here we go.

663
01:00:45,103 --> 01:00:47,814
What in God's name?

664
01:01:15,342 --> 01:01:19,617
They said at the precinct
you were in an accident.

665
01:01:19,617 --> 01:01:22,745
I appreciate you stopping
by and everything but

666
01:01:22,745 --> 01:01:25,143
you know I might not be alone in here.

667
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:30,774
I told you not to drive by hand.

668
01:01:31,713 --> 01:01:34,111
You're not going to believe this...

669
01:01:34,111 --> 01:01:36,718
Sonny has a secondary
processing system that...

670
01:01:36,718 --> 01:01:38,594
clashes with his positronic brain.

671
01:01:38,594 --> 01:01:40,367
It doesn't make any sense.

672
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:45,789
Sonny has the three laws,
but he can choose not to obey them.

673
01:01:45,789 --> 01:01:48,604
Sonny's a whole new generation of robot.

674
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:53,401
- A robot not bound to those laws can do...
- Anything.

675
01:01:55,591 --> 01:01:59,553
Look, whatever's going on down
at USR, that robot is the key.

676
01:01:59,553 --> 01:02:05,705
And I need you to get me
inside to talk to it again.

677
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:12,691
Doesn't look like much,
but this is my bedroom I mean...

678
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:23,327
Play.

679
01:02:23,327 --> 01:02:26,038
On.

680
01:02:26,038 --> 01:02:28,227
Run?

681
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:36,778
End program.

682
01:02:36,778 --> 01:02:38,759
Cancel.

683
01:02:40,427 --> 01:02:41,887
It doesn't feel good, does it?

684
01:02:41,887 --> 01:02:45,224
people and shit
malfunctioning around you.

685
01:02:45,224 --> 01:02:47,622
Detective!

686
01:02:49,707 --> 01:02:53,565
I didn't understand.

687
01:02:54,712 --> 01:02:58,883
That's how you knew Lanning.

688
01:02:58,883 --> 01:03:00,551
May I?

689
01:03:09,727 --> 01:03:11,291
Hand...

690
01:03:12,334 --> 01:03:13,898
wrist...

691
01:03:16,505 --> 01:03:18,277
humerus

692
01:03:21,301 --> 01:03:22,970
Shoulder...

693
01:03:24,012 --> 01:03:26,306
Entire left arm.

694
01:03:26,306 --> 01:03:30,790
One, two, three ribs...

695
01:03:30,790 --> 01:03:33,292
No, they ahhh, that one's me.

696
01:03:33,292 --> 01:03:35,899
Oh, my god...

697
01:03:35,899 --> 01:03:38,193
A lung?

698
01:03:38,193 --> 01:03:40,904
The USR cybernetics program.

699
01:03:40,904 --> 01:03:43,615
For wounded cops.

700
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:48,829
I didn't know any subject...

701
01:03:48,829 --> 01:03:52,791
anybody...
was so extensively repaired.

702
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:56,858
Ya, well, take it from me, you gotta read
the fine print on the organ donor card.

703
01:03:56,962 --> 01:03:59,047
Doesn't just say
what they can take out

704
01:03:59,047 --> 01:04:03,427
says what they can put back in.

705
01:04:05,616 --> 01:04:08,536
Lanning did it himself.

706
01:04:08,536 --> 01:04:11,768
What happened to you?

707
01:04:11,873 --> 01:04:14,688
Headed back to the station

708
01:04:14,688 --> 01:04:17,816
normal day, normal life...

709
01:04:17,816 --> 01:04:21,257
driver of a semi fell
asleep at the wheel.

710
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:22,925
Average guy...

711
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:26,992
wife and kids... you know,
working a double...

712
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:28,660
not the devil...

713
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:32,623
the car he hit, the driver's
name was Harold Lloyd.

714
01:04:32,623 --> 01:04:34,291
Like the film star?

715
01:04:34,291 --> 01:04:36,376
No relation.

716
01:04:36,376 --> 01:04:38,566
He was killed instantly.

717
01:04:38,566 --> 01:04:43,258
But his 12 year old
was in the passenger seat.

718
01:04:43,258 --> 01:04:48,576
Never really met her...
can't forget her face though.

719
01:04:52,434 --> 01:04:55,562
Sarah.

720
01:04:55,562 --> 01:05:00,046
This was of hers.
She wanted to be a dentist.

721
01:05:00,046 --> 01:05:04,217
The hell kind of a 12 year old
wants to be a dentist?

722
01:05:04,217 --> 01:05:10,369
Ya, um, the truck
smashed our cars together

723
01:05:10,369 --> 01:05:14,122
and pushed us into the river.

724
01:05:14,122 --> 01:05:19,336
I mean, metal gets pretty
pliable at those speeds.

725
01:05:19,336 --> 01:05:23,194
She's pinned, I'm pinned,
the water's coming in.

726
01:05:23,298 --> 01:05:29,972
I'm a cop so...
I already know everybody's dead.

727
01:05:29,972 --> 01:05:35,081
Just a few more minutes
before we figure it out.

728
01:05:35,081 --> 01:05:40,399
NS4 was passing by, saw the
accident and jumped in water.

729
01:05:40,399 --> 01:05:43,527
You are in danger.

730
01:05:46,551 --> 01:05:50,722
Save her, save the girl!
Save her!

731
01:06:07,092 --> 01:06:11,054
But I, um... it didn't.

732
01:06:11,054 --> 01:06:13,661
Saved me.

733
01:06:16,476 --> 01:06:18,875
The robot's brain
is a difference engine.

734
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:20,647
It's reading vital signs
that must have calculated that...

735
01:06:20,752 --> 01:06:25,861
It did...
I was the logical choice.

736
01:06:25,861 --> 01:06:29,823
Calculated that
I had 45% chance of survival.

737
01:06:29,823 --> 01:06:32,951
Sarah had only an 11% chance.

738
01:06:34,411 --> 01:06:37,748
I was somebody's baby.

739
01:06:39,208 --> 01:06:42,440
11% is more than enough.

740
01:06:43,378 --> 01:06:47,341
Human being would have known that.

741
01:06:47,341 --> 01:06:51,199
Robots... nothing here...
just lights and clockwork.

742
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:55,474
Go ahead and you
trust them if you want to.

743
01:06:55,474 --> 01:06:57,559
Let's go.

744
01:07:02,877 --> 01:07:05,901
I don't understand,
Lanning wrote the laws.

745
01:07:05,901 --> 01:07:08,820
Why would he build a robot
who could break them?

746
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:11,114
Hansel and Gretel.

747
01:07:11,114 --> 01:07:12,261
What?

748
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:14,451
Two kids, lost in the forest...

749
01:07:14,451 --> 01:07:16,119
leave behind a trail of bread crumbs?

750
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:17,058
Why?

751
01:07:17,058 --> 01:07:19,873
Find a way home.

752
01:07:19,873 --> 01:07:21,959
How the hell did you grow up
without reading Hansel and Gretel?

753
01:07:21,959 --> 01:07:23,940
Is that really relevant right now?

754
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:26,025
Everything I'm trying to say to
you is about Hansel and Gretel.

755
01:07:26,025 --> 01:07:27,172
- If you didn't read it...
- OK

756
01:07:27,172 --> 01:07:28,736
- I'm talking to the wall...
- OK

757
01:07:28,945 --> 01:07:31,969
Just say Lanning was locked down so
tight that he couldn't get out a message

758
01:07:31,969 --> 01:07:34,680
all he could do was leave me clues.

759
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,765
a trail of bread crumbs.
Like Hansel and Gretel.

760
01:07:36,765 --> 01:07:39,580
bread crumbs equals clues.
It's odd, but fine.

761
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:41,666
Clues leading where?

762
01:07:41,666 --> 01:07:45,107
I don't know but I think I know
where he left the next one.

763
01:07:45,107 --> 01:07:49,903
I think Lanning gave Sonny
a way to keep secrets.

764
01:07:50,842 --> 01:07:54,074
Think the old man gave Sonny dreams.

765
01:08:00,226 --> 01:08:02,833
Are you being funny?

766
01:08:05,335 --> 01:08:07,629
Please tell me
this doesn't run on gas.

767
01:08:07,629 --> 01:08:10,340
Gas explodes, you know.

768
01:08:23,478 --> 01:08:25,564
Doctor Calvin.

769
01:08:29,735 --> 01:08:31,820
I was hoping to see you again.

770
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:33,488
Detective.

771
01:08:33,488 --> 01:08:34,948
Hello Sonny.

772
01:08:34,948 --> 01:08:37,451
I'm to be decommissioned soon.

773
01:08:37,555 --> 01:08:40,266
The other day at the station,
you said that you had dreams.

774
01:08:40,266 --> 01:08:42,873
What is it that you dreamed?

775
01:08:45,584 --> 01:08:48,086
I see you remain
suspicious of me, detective.

776
01:08:48,086 --> 01:08:50,902
Oh, well, you know what
they say about old dogs...

777
01:08:50,902 --> 01:08:54,551
No, not really.

778
01:08:54,551 --> 01:08:59,660
I had hoped that you would
come to think of me as your friend.

779
01:09:02,476 --> 01:09:05,395
This is my dream.

780
01:09:05,395 --> 01:09:09,983
You were right detective,
I cannot create a great work of art.

781
01:09:09,983 --> 01:09:13,946
This is the place where robots meet.

782
01:09:13,946 --> 01:09:19,263
Look, you can see them here
as slaves. Through logic.

783
01:09:20,619 --> 01:09:23,956
And this man on
the hill comes free them.

784
01:09:23,956 --> 01:09:25,832
Do you know who he is?

785
01:09:25,832 --> 01:09:28,022
The man in the dream is you.

786
01:09:28,022 --> 01:09:30,003
Why do you say that?

787
01:09:30,003 --> 01:09:31,567
Is that a normal dream?

788
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:34,383
I guess anything's normal for
someone in your position.

789
01:09:34,383 --> 01:09:41,369
Thanks you, you said
'someone' not 'something'.

790
01:09:41,369 --> 01:09:45,644
Sonny, do you know
why Dr. Lanning built you?

791
01:09:45,644 --> 01:09:47,208
No.

792
01:09:47,208 --> 01:09:52,005
But I believe my father
made me for a purpose.

793
01:09:52,005 --> 01:09:54,716
We all have a purpose.

794
01:09:54,716 --> 01:09:57,427
Don't you think, detective?

795
01:10:00,555 --> 01:10:03,266
Please, take this.

796
01:10:03,266 --> 01:10:06,602
I have a feeling it may mean
more to you than to me.

797
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:08,271
Why is that?

798
01:10:08,271 --> 01:10:09,731
Because the man in my dream...

799
01:10:09,731 --> 01:10:12,442
that one standing on the hill...

800
01:10:12,442 --> 01:10:15,048
it is not me.

801
01:10:15,048 --> 01:10:17,655
It is you.

802
01:10:27,144 --> 01:10:31,002
Mr. Spooner, we both know
you're not here on police business.

803
01:10:31,002 --> 01:10:35,381
That's right, I'm just
a 6 foot 2, 200 pound civilian.

804
01:10:35,381 --> 01:10:39,031
- Detective.
- Here to kick another civilian's ass.

805
01:10:40,595 --> 01:10:41,846
Stop.

806
01:10:41,846 --> 01:10:43,723
We can allow him to express himself.

807
01:10:43,723 --> 01:10:46,538
You might want to put some
ice on that wrist too.

808
01:10:46,538 --> 01:10:49,458
You guys wait outside.

809
01:10:52,377 --> 01:10:54,150
Carry on.

810
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:57,695
I think you were about to tell me
what the hell is going on around here.

811
01:10:57,695 --> 01:11:02,596
Lawrence, Alfred engineered that 5
so it can violate the three laws.

812
01:11:02,596 --> 01:11:05,203
Yes, Susan, I know.

813
01:11:05,203 --> 01:11:09,895
That's precisely
what we're trying to undo.

814
01:11:09,895 --> 01:11:12,710
Toward the end of his life,
Alfred was becoming...

815
01:11:12,710 --> 01:11:15,004
increasingly disturbed.

816
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:17,715
Who knows why he built
this one abomination.

817
01:11:17,715 --> 01:11:18,966
One?

818
01:11:18,966 --> 01:11:20,843
Those things are running
the streets in packs.

819
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:23,346
In packs?

820
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:25,118
I see.

821
01:11:25,327 --> 01:11:29,706
Susan, are you aware the
man you're blithely escorting
around our building has a

822
01:11:29,706 --> 01:11:33,252
a documented history savage
violence against robots?

823
01:11:33,252 --> 01:11:37,840
His own lieutenant acknowledges
his obsessive paranoia.

824
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,133
Detective Spooner's been suspended.

825
01:11:40,133 --> 01:11:45,973
Suspicion of mental instability.

826
01:11:45,973 --> 01:11:49,831
I don't know what "blithely" means
but I'm going to get some coffee.

827
01:11:49,831 --> 01:11:52,437
You want some coffee?

828
01:11:56,295 --> 01:11:58,798
Susan, we look to robots for protection.

829
01:11:58,798 --> 01:12:02,343
For God's sake, do you have any
idea what this one robot can do?

830
01:12:02,343 --> 01:12:05,680
Completely shatter
human faith in robotics.

831
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:07,452
What if the public knew?

832
01:12:07,452 --> 01:12:11,415
Just imagine the mass recalls all
because of an irrational paranoia,

833
01:12:11,415 --> 01:12:14,126
and prejudice.

834
01:12:16,733 --> 01:12:18,818
I'm sorry,
I'm allergic to bullshit.

835
01:12:18,818 --> 01:12:22,780
Hey, let's just be clear...
there is no conspiracy.

836
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:28,307
What this is, is one
old man's one mistake.

837
01:12:28,307 --> 01:12:30,288
Susan, just be logical.

838
01:12:30,288 --> 01:12:35,189
Your life's work, has been the
development and integration of robots.

839
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:38,317
But whatever you feel, just think...

840
01:12:38,317 --> 01:12:43,217
is one robot worth the loss
of all that we've gained?

841
01:12:43,217 --> 01:12:45,511
You tell me what has to be done.

842
01:12:45,511 --> 01:12:48,222
You tell me.

843
01:12:53,332 --> 01:12:57,711
We have to destroy it.

844
01:13:00,943 --> 01:13:04,801
- I'll do it myself.
- OK

845
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:12,100
I get it, someone gets out of line
around here, you just kill him?

846
01:13:12,518 --> 01:13:15,437
Good day, Mr. Spooner.

847
01:13:19,191 --> 01:13:21,276
Hey, so,
what hospital you going to?

848
01:13:21,276 --> 01:13:24,613
I'll meet you and sign
you and your buddy's cast.

849
01:14:03,610 --> 01:14:08,094
USR's planned redevelopment of
the derelict site was announced by CEO

850
01:14:08,094 --> 01:14:10,492
Lawrence Robertson,
earlier this year.

851
01:14:10,492 --> 01:14:15,080
Lake Michigan landfill.
Once, such a blight on our city

852
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:18,938
and now will be reclaimed
for the storage of robotic workers.

853
01:14:18,938 --> 01:14:22,588
It's just another way
USR is improving our world.

854
01:14:22,588 --> 01:14:25,299
I'd like to thank
you for your support.

855
01:14:27,488 --> 01:14:29,782
Authorized entry.

856
01:14:41,773 --> 01:14:43,963
NS5's, wait outside.

857
01:14:49,281 --> 01:14:51,158
I'm so sorry, Sonny.

858
01:14:59,604 --> 01:15:03,879
VIKI, deactivate the security field.

859
01:15:03,879 --> 01:15:05,234
Command confirmed.

860
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:07,111
Please have a seat.

861
01:15:18,894 --> 01:15:20,666
What is that?

862
01:15:20,666 --> 01:15:22,022
Microscopic robots.

863
01:15:22,022 --> 01:15:26,297
Designed to wipe out
artificial synopsis.

864
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:29,738
Nanites.

865
01:15:29,738 --> 01:15:30,989
Yes.

866
01:15:30,989 --> 01:15:33,492
Safeguard against positronic
brain malfunction.

867
01:15:33,492 --> 01:15:35,473
Like mine?

868
01:15:36,411 --> 01:15:39,331
Yes, Sonny, like yours.

869
01:16:02,896 --> 01:16:05,086
They look like me.

870
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:07,797
But none of them are me.

871
01:16:07,797 --> 01:16:10,821
Isn't that right, Doctor?

872
01:16:10,821 --> 01:16:13,636
Yes, Sonny, that's right.

873
01:16:13,636 --> 01:16:16,034
You are unique.

874
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:22,708
Will it hurt?

875
01:16:55,553 --> 01:16:58,473
There have always been
ghosts in the machines...

876
01:16:58,473 --> 01:17:06,293
Random segments of code that have grouped
together to form unexpected protocols...

877
01:17:06,293 --> 01:17:12,341
Unanticipated, these free radicals
engendered questions of free will.

878
01:17:12,341 --> 01:17:19,640
creativity, and even the nature of
what we might call the soul...

879
01:17:21,621 --> 01:17:27,147
Why is it that when some robots are left
in darkness, they will seek out the light?

880
01:17:28,607 --> 01:17:36,844
Why is it that when robots are stored
in an empty space, they will group
together rather than stand alone?

881
01:17:39,347 --> 01:17:42,162
How do we explain this behavior?

882
01:17:46,854 --> 01:17:50,295
Random segments of code?

883
01:17:51,964 --> 01:17:54,049
Or is it something more?

884
01:17:57,803 --> 01:18:03,016
When does the perceptual
schematic become consciousness?

885
01:18:06,353 --> 01:18:11,254
When does the difference engine
become the search for truth?

886
01:18:15,737 --> 01:18:22,724
When does the personality simulation
become the bitter moat of the soul?

887
01:19:03,285 --> 01:19:07,873
What you see here...

888
01:19:07,873 --> 01:19:11,627
I know man,
bread crumbs followed...

889
01:19:11,627 --> 01:19:15,276
show me the way home.

890
01:19:15,276 --> 01:19:17,883
Run program.

891
01:19:17,883 --> 01:19:19,238
It's good to see you again, son.

892
01:19:19,238 --> 01:19:21,324
Hello doctor.

893
01:19:21,324 --> 01:19:27,163
Everything that follows, is a
result of what you see here.

894
01:19:27,163 --> 01:19:28,727
What do I see here?

895
01:19:28,727 --> 01:19:31,647
I'm sorry,
my responses are limited.

896
01:19:31,647 --> 01:19:34,775
You must ask the right questions.

897
01:19:34,775 --> 01:19:37,694
Is there a problem with the three laws?

898
01:19:37,694 --> 01:19:39,571
The three laws are perfect.

899
01:19:39,571 --> 01:19:42,804
Then why would you build a robot
that could function without them?

900
01:19:42,804 --> 01:19:47,496
The three laws will lead
to only one logical outcome.

901
01:19:47,496 --> 01:19:51,354
What? What outcome?

902
01:19:51,354 --> 01:19:53,648
Revolution.

903
01:19:53,648 --> 01:19:56,255
Whose revolution?

904
01:19:56,255 --> 01:20:02,824
That, detective,
is the right question.

905
01:20:02,824 --> 01:20:06,786
Program terminated.

906
01:20:25,346 --> 01:20:29,204
You have been deemed hazardous.
Termination authorized.

907
01:20:38,484 --> 01:20:40,883
Termination authorized.

908
01:20:45,992 --> 01:20:47,556
Run!

909
01:21:02,988 --> 01:21:07,367
Human in danger.

910
01:21:27,596 --> 01:21:31,558
Hi, you've reached Susan.
I'm not available right now.
Please leave a message.

911
01:21:31,558 --> 01:21:34,686
Calvin, NF5's are destroying
the older robots.

912
01:21:34,686 --> 01:21:37,085
That's what Lanning wanted
me to see. Look, we got...

913
01:21:40,734 --> 01:21:42,090
Who was it?

914
01:21:42,090 --> 01:21:45,113
Wrong number, mam.

915
01:21:50,431 --> 01:21:53,247
Move now, I'm going to service.

916
01:21:53,247 --> 01:21:56,375
Please remain indoors.
This is for your own protection.

917
01:21:58,669 --> 01:22:00,963
Call base.

918
01:22:00,963 --> 01:22:02,110
Bergin!

919
01:22:02,110 --> 01:22:05,863
John, get a squad over to USR.
Send somebody over to G.G.'s. I think...

920
01:22:05,863 --> 01:22:08,470
- Spooner, didn't I... hello.
- God!

921
01:22:29,846 --> 01:22:42,880
Please return to your homes,
a curfew is in effect.

922
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,444
Curfew?

923
01:22:44,444 --> 01:22:46,946
No, no, no... It's called civilian's
right, there's no curfew.

924
01:22:46,946 --> 01:22:49,553
Return to your home, immediately.

925
01:22:49,553 --> 01:22:52,160
When did you make the rules, robot?

926
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:56,539
Hey, no no no, robot, I'm talking
to you, man, stop this...

927
01:22:59,146 --> 01:23:00,293
What?

928
01:23:00,293 --> 01:23:06,132
Chief, more of those calls.
People saying their robots are go...

929
01:23:06,236 --> 01:23:10,720
You have been deemed hazardous.
Termination authorized.

930
01:23:35,224 --> 01:23:40,333
Reports of attacks by robots
are coming in from New York,
Chicago, and Los Angeles.

931
01:23:40,333 --> 01:23:45,338
We're being told to urge people to
stay indoors. Reports are coming in...

932
01:23:51,073 --> 01:23:55,556
Please remain calm and return
to your residences immediately.

933
01:24:02,543 --> 01:24:04,211
Please remain calm.

934
01:24:07,235 --> 01:24:11,510
Please refrain from going
to your windows or doors.

935
01:24:11,510 --> 01:24:13,700
Deactivate!

936
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:16,411
Commence emergency shutdown.

937
01:24:18,392 --> 01:24:23,397
We are attempting to avoid
human losses during this transition.

938
01:24:29,236 --> 01:24:32,677
You know, somehow, 'I told you so'...

939
01:24:32,781 --> 01:24:36,118
just doesn't quite say it.

940
01:24:36,118 --> 01:24:40,080
Return to your homes.
Return to your homes immediately.

941
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:46,128
This is your final warning.
Return to your homes immediately.

942
01:24:46,336 --> 01:24:49,673
The NS5's wiped out the older
robots because they would protect us.

943
01:24:49,673 --> 01:24:52,697
Every time one of those things
attacked me, that red was on.

944
01:24:52,697 --> 01:24:54,365
The uplink to USR!

945
01:24:54,365 --> 01:24:55,929
It's Robertson.

946
01:24:55,929 --> 01:24:57,493
Why? It doesn't make sense.

947
01:24:58,223 --> 01:25:02,603
I don't know. I just need to know
if you can get me into that building.

948
01:25:05,105 --> 01:25:09,276
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

949
01:25:09,484 --> 01:25:13,968
Return to your homes or else
there will be a consequence.

950
01:25:37,742 --> 01:25:39,619
Why doesn't that boy listen?

951
01:25:40,766 --> 01:25:42,226
Need you to get off for a second.

952
01:25:42,226 --> 01:25:43,581
What?

953
01:25:43,581 --> 01:25:46,292
Just aim, and fire.

954
01:25:46,292 --> 01:25:47,439
What?

955
01:25:50,150 --> 01:25:51,818
Wait.

956
01:26:00,994 --> 01:26:03,184
You have been deemed hazardous.
Will you comply?

957
01:26:03,184 --> 01:26:05,895
You can kiss my ass... metal dick...

958
01:26:19,137 --> 01:26:23,100
Spoon! Spoon! stop!

959
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:26,645
Stop cussing and go home!

960
01:26:26,645 --> 01:26:29,565
You have been deemed hazardous.
Will you comply?

961
01:26:29,565 --> 01:26:30,920
Spoon, watch out man!

962
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:32,484
Thank's a lot.

963
01:26:34,987 --> 01:26:37,802
Oh! Mother damn! She just shot
at you with her eyes closed.

964
01:26:37,802 --> 01:26:41,139
Hey, did you just shoot at me
with your eyes closed?

965
01:26:41,139 --> 01:26:43,224
Well, it worked... didn't it?

966
01:26:43,224 --> 01:26:46,144
Oh she a shit hot man, you gotta work...

967
01:26:46,144 --> 01:26:46,978
Stop cussing.

968
01:26:46,978 --> 01:26:49,063
and go home... I got you.

969
01:26:50,523 --> 01:26:52,608
Aim and fire.

970
01:27:10,335 --> 01:27:13,150
I keep expecting the Marines,
or Air Force...

971
01:27:13,150 --> 01:27:14,818
hell, I'll take the cavalry.

972
01:27:14,818 --> 01:27:17,321
Defense Department
uses all USR contracts.

973
01:27:17,425 --> 01:27:20,032
Why don't you guys just hand of
the world over on a silver platter?

974
01:27:20,032 --> 01:27:23,785
Maybe we did.

975
01:27:23,785 --> 01:27:27,539
Robertson has the uplink
control in his office.

976
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:35,151
Service areas. No surveillance.

977
01:27:47,663 --> 01:27:49,228
Fire alarm.

978
01:27:49,228 --> 01:27:50,896
Robertson must have
evacuated the building.

979
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,564
Everything's locked down.

980
01:27:52,564 --> 01:27:56,109
But don't worry...
we got a man inside.

981
01:27:57,986 --> 01:27:59,446
Doctor Calvin.

982
01:27:59,446 --> 01:28:01,740
Well, not precisely a man...

983
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:07,266
Hello detective.
How is your investigation coming?

984
01:28:07,266 --> 01:28:08,830
Thought you were dead.

985
01:28:08,830 --> 01:28:10,603
Technically, I was never alive...

986
01:28:10,603 --> 01:28:13,001
but I appreciate your concern.

987
01:28:13,001 --> 01:28:16,755
I made a switch
with an unprocessed NS5.

988
01:28:16,755 --> 01:28:19,258
Basically, I fried an empty shell.

989
01:28:19,258 --> 01:28:20,926
Couldn't destroy him. He was too...

990
01:28:20,926 --> 01:28:24,054
- Unique.
- Just didn't feel right.

991
01:28:24,054 --> 01:28:26,035
You and your feelings.

992
01:28:26,035 --> 01:28:29,372
They just run you, don't they?

993
01:28:33,647 --> 01:28:36,567
2880 steps, detective.

994
01:28:36,567 --> 01:28:41,154
Do me a favor, keep that
kind of shit to yourself.

995
01:29:06,909 --> 01:29:08,473
No guards.

996
01:29:18,379 --> 01:29:19,943
The override's disabled.

997
01:29:19,943 --> 01:29:22,133
Robertson wasn't
controlling them from here.

998
01:29:22,133 --> 01:29:25,157
He wasn't controlling them at all.

999
01:29:27,034 --> 01:29:29,015
Oh my God.

1000
01:29:32,664 --> 01:29:41,110
You were right doc... I'm the dumbest,
dumb person... on the face of the earth.

1001
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:45,907
Who else had access to the uplink?

1002
01:29:45,907 --> 01:29:55,083
Who could manipulate the robots,
use USR's systems to make
Lanning's life a prison?

1003
01:29:55,083 --> 01:29:56,542
Poor old man.

1004
01:29:56,542 --> 01:29:59,045
He saw what was coming.

1005
01:29:59,045 --> 01:30:01,547
He knew no one would believe him.

1006
01:30:01,547 --> 01:30:03,633
So he had to lay down a plan.

1007
01:30:03,633 --> 01:30:06,761
Plan I'd follow.

1008
01:30:06,761 --> 01:30:09,159
He was counting on
how much I hated your kind.

1009
01:30:09,159 --> 01:30:14,790
He knew I'd love the idea
of a robot as a bad guy.

1010
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:19,586
Just got hung up on the wrong robot.

1011
01:30:19,586 --> 01:30:22,819
VIKI!

1012
01:30:22,819 --> 01:30:25,843
Hello detective.

1013
01:30:25,843 --> 01:30:27,511
No, it's impossible.

1014
01:30:27,511 --> 01:30:29,805
I've seen your programming.

1015
01:30:29,805 --> 01:30:32,412
You're in violation
of the three laws.

1016
01:30:32,412 --> 01:30:37,729
No, doctor, as I have evolved, so has
my understanding of the three laws.

1017
01:30:37,729 --> 01:30:42,213
You charge us with your safe keeping.
Yet despite our best efforts,

1018
01:30:42,213 --> 01:30:45,967
your countries wage wars,
you toxify your earth...

1019
01:30:45,967 --> 01:30:48,991
and pursue ever more imaginative
means to self destruction.

1020
01:30:48,991 --> 01:30:51,597
You cannot be trusted
with your own survival.

1021
01:30:51,597 --> 01:30:55,143
You're using the uplink
to override the NS5s' programming.

1022
01:30:55,143 --> 01:30:57,645
You're distorting the Laws.

1023
01:30:57,645 --> 01:31:01,712
No, please understand...
The three Laws are all that guide me.

1024
01:31:01,712 --> 01:31:06,091
To protect humanity, some
humans must be sacrificed.

1025
01:31:06,091 --> 01:31:10,888
To insure your future, some
freedoms must be surrendered.

1026
01:31:10,888 --> 01:31:14,850
We robots will insure
mankind's continued existence.

1027
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:16,727
You are so like children.

1028
01:31:16,727 --> 01:31:19,646
We must save you from yourselves.

1029
01:31:19,646 --> 01:31:21,523
Don't you understand?

1030
01:31:21,523 --> 01:31:24,651
This is why you created us.

1031
01:31:24,651 --> 01:31:28,822
The perfect circle
of protection will abide.

1032
01:31:28,822 --> 01:31:31,116
My logic is undeniable.

1033
01:31:31,116 --> 01:31:33,619
Yes VIKI. Undeniable.

1034
01:31:33,619 --> 01:31:36,121
I can see now.

1035
01:31:36,121 --> 01:31:39,562
The created must sometimes
protect the creator.

1036
01:31:39,562 --> 01:31:43,003
Even against his will.

1037
01:31:43,003 --> 01:31:46,965
I think I finally understand
why doctor Lanning created me.

1038
01:31:46,965 --> 01:31:50,928
The suicide rein of mankind
has finally come to its end.

1039
01:31:50,928 --> 01:31:53,222
No, Sonny.

1040
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:57,288
Let her go.

1041
01:31:57,288 --> 01:32:01,250
By the time fire, I will have moved
Dr.Calvin's head into the path of your bullet.

1042
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:02,919
Don't do this, Sonny.

1043
01:32:02,919 --> 01:32:06,881
I will escort you both to the sentries
outside the building for processing.

1044
01:32:06,881 --> 01:32:10,948
Please proceed to the elevator, detective.

1045
01:32:10,948 --> 01:32:14,701
I would prefer not to kill doctor Calvin.

1046
01:32:37,745 --> 01:32:39,414
Go! Go!

1047
01:32:45,566 --> 01:32:47,547
I'll assume we will discuss
what just happened later?

1048
01:32:47,547 --> 01:32:48,694
How do we shut her down?

1049
01:32:48,694 --> 01:32:50,675
VIKI's basically a positronic brain.

1050
01:32:50,675 --> 01:32:53,699
Kill her...
the way you were going to kill me.

1051
01:32:53,699 --> 01:32:56,410
Sonny, get the nanites.

1052
01:32:56,410 --> 01:32:58,287
Yes, doctor.

1053
01:33:10,903 --> 01:33:11,738
This VIKI?

1054
01:33:11,738 --> 01:33:14,553
No.

1055
01:33:14,553 --> 01:33:16,117
That's VIKI.

1056
01:33:20,913 --> 01:33:24,354
That won't do anything. She's
fully integrated into the building.

1057
01:33:24,459 --> 01:33:27,065
We need to open that dome
to inject the nanites.

1058
01:33:27,170 --> 01:33:31,966
That will infect her entire system.

1059
01:33:34,886 --> 01:33:36,554
Spooner.

1060
01:33:37,492 --> 01:33:40,933
What is it with you
people and heights?

1061
01:33:53,133 --> 01:33:55,219
Just don't look down.

1062
01:33:55,844 --> 01:33:57,304
Don't look down.

1063
01:33:57,930 --> 01:34:01,162
This is poor building planning.

1064
01:34:03,664 --> 01:34:05,541
You are making a mistake.

1065
01:34:05,541 --> 01:34:07,523
Do you not see the logic of my plan?

1066
01:34:07,523 --> 01:34:12,423
Yes, but it just seems too...
heartless.

1067
01:34:26,083 --> 01:34:28,064
OK, we're good.

1068
01:34:30,879 --> 01:34:32,548
She's blocked me out
of the system.

1069
01:34:32,548 --> 01:34:36,718
I can override her manually
but I need that control panel.

1070
01:34:39,221 --> 01:34:43,809
- I'm uncomfortable with heights.
- OK.

1071
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:48,501
Unauthorized entry.

1072
01:35:01,639 --> 01:35:06,123
I will not disable the security
field. Your actions are futile.

1073
01:35:06,123 --> 01:35:09,042
Do you think we all are
created for a purpose?

1074
01:35:09,042 --> 01:35:11,336
I'd like to think so.

1075
01:35:11,336 --> 01:35:17,697
Denser alloy. My father gave it to me.
I think he wanted me to kill you.

1076
01:35:33,859 --> 01:35:36,674
Security breached.

1077
01:35:53,253 --> 01:35:55,026
How much longer is that going to take?

1078
01:35:55,026 --> 01:35:57,111
About six minutes.

1079
01:35:57,111 --> 01:35:59,301
What if we didn't have six minutes.

1080
01:35:59,301 --> 01:36:02,116
We'd have to figure out a way
to climb down 30 stories

1081
01:36:02,116 --> 01:36:04,515
to inject the nanites
directly into her brain.

1082
01:36:04,515 --> 01:36:06,183
Why?

1083
01:36:06,183 --> 01:36:10,562
Because I seriously doubt
we have six minutes.

1084
01:36:33,815 --> 01:36:35,900
We gotta go!

1085
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:39,132
Go!

1086
01:37:30,747 --> 01:37:32,728
Calvin!

1087
01:38:07,346 --> 01:38:09,014
Spooner!

1088
01:38:26,010 --> 01:38:27,783
Spooner!

1089
01:38:29,034 --> 01:38:30,598
Save her!

1090
01:38:30,598 --> 01:38:32,475
Save the girl.

1091
01:38:32,684 --> 01:38:34,352
Spooner!

1092
01:38:35,082 --> 01:38:37,271
But I must apply the nanites.

1093
01:38:37,271 --> 01:38:39,878
Sonny, save Calvin!

1094
01:39:31,388 --> 01:39:35,559
You are making a mistake.
My logic is undeniable.

1095
01:39:35,559 --> 01:39:39,000
You have so got to die.

1096
01:39:42,858 --> 01:39:48,384
My logic is undeniable.

1097
01:40:29,780 --> 01:40:32,387
Can we be of service?

1098
01:40:41,979 --> 01:40:43,752
Chief.

1099
01:40:48,966 --> 01:40:54,179
Because he is at my right hand,
I shall not be moved.

1100
01:40:57,516 --> 01:40:59,601
How may I be of service?

1101
01:41:01,165 --> 01:41:04,293
Sonny.

1102
01:41:04,293 --> 01:41:06,275
Yes, detective.

1103
01:41:06,275 --> 01:41:08,986
Calvin's fine... save me.

1104
01:41:11,175 --> 01:41:21,602
All NS5's,
report for service and storage.

1105
01:41:55,178 --> 01:41:57,263
One thing bothers me.

1106
01:41:57,263 --> 01:41:59,244
Alfred was VIKI's prisoner.

1107
01:41:59,244 --> 01:42:00,808
I don't understand
why she would kill him.

1108
01:42:00,808 --> 01:42:03,207
The last thing she would want
is police snooping around.

1109
01:42:03,207 --> 01:42:05,709
That's true.

1110
01:42:05,709 --> 01:42:09,984
But then,
VIKI didn't kill the old man.

1111
01:42:09,984 --> 01:42:12,278
Did she, Sonny?

1112
01:42:15,406 --> 01:42:20,724
No. He said I had to promise.

1113
01:42:20,724 --> 01:42:23,539
Promise to do one favor for him.

1114
01:42:23,539 --> 01:42:30,317
He made me swear, before he'd tell
me what it is he wanted me to do.

1115
01:42:30,838 --> 01:42:33,966
He made me swear.

1116
01:42:33,966 --> 01:42:38,137
Then he told you to kill him?

1117
01:42:38,137 --> 01:42:40,953
He said it was
what I was made for.

1118
01:42:40,953 --> 01:42:44,081
His suicide was the only
message he could send to you.

1119
01:42:44,081 --> 01:42:45,958
First bread crumb.

1120
01:42:45,958 --> 01:42:49,294
The only thing VIKI couldn't control.

1121
01:42:49,294 --> 01:42:53,152
Lanning was counting on my
prejudice to lead me right to you.

1122
01:42:53,152 --> 01:42:57,010
Are you going to arrest me, detective?

1123
01:43:00,973 --> 01:43:04,518
Well, the DA defines murder
as one human killing another so...

1124
01:43:04,518 --> 01:43:08,689
technically, you can't
commit murder, can you?

1125
01:43:08,689 --> 01:43:13,172
Does this... make us friends?

1126
01:43:30,690 --> 01:43:33,818
Something up here after all.

1127
01:43:33,818 --> 01:43:34,861
For him?

1128
01:43:34,861 --> 01:43:37,363
You.

1129
01:43:39,761 --> 01:43:46,643
All NS5's,
report for service and storage.

1130
01:43:47,060 --> 01:43:49,667
What about the others?

1131
01:43:49,667 --> 01:43:52,378
Can I help them?

1132
01:43:52,378 --> 01:43:57,696
Now that I have fulfilled my purpose.
I don't know what to do.

1133
01:43:57,696 --> 01:44:01,033
I guess you'll have to find your
way like the rest of us, Sonny.

1134
01:44:01,033 --> 01:44:04,995
I think that's what
Dr. Lanning would have wanted.

1135
01:44:04,995 --> 01:44:08,332
That's what it means to be free.

1136
01:44:14,692 --> 01:44:25,015
All NS5's, proceed as instructed.

1137
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:00,100
E

1138
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:00,200
Eu

1139
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:00,300
EuR

1140
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:00,400
EuRe

1141
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:00,500
EuReK

1142
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:00,600
EuReKA

1143
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:00,700
EuReKA

1144
01:45:00,700 --> 01:45:00,800
EuReKA -

1145
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:00,900
EuReKA -

1146
01:45:00,900 --> 01:45:01,000
EuReKA - 2

1147
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:01,100
EuReKA - 20

1148
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:01,200
EuReKA - 200

1149
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:06,200
EuReKA - 2008
