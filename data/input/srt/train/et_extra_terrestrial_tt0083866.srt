ELLIOTT: You have no right to do this.

<i>You're scaring him.</i>

822
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,074
<i>[Yells] You're scaring him!</i>

823
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:22,513
DOCTOR 2: Respiratory rate: 12.

824
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:25,273
DOCTOR 3: Good air entry
but decreased tidal volume on the boy.

825
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:28,909
<i>Put him on 025 liters by nasal cannula
and draw blood gas in 20 minutes.</i>

826

from 20 to 17 degrees.

827
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:33,510
DOCTOR 1: Get a hypothermia blanket
and some rags.

828
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,158
ELLIOTT: Leave him alone.

829
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:38,755
<i>Leave him alone. I can take care of him.</i>

830
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,076
DOCTOR 2:
...and set me up for a 2D cardiac echo.

831
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:43,071
DOCTOR 1: Skin is cool and diaphoretic.

832
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:46,038
DOCTOR 2: He's not refusing at all.
He needs anatropic support.

833
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:47,633
DOCTOR 3: PH is down to 7.03.

834

<i>He's got a metabolic acidosis. It could be sepsis.</i>

835

DOCTOR 1:
We've drawn two sets of blood cultures.

836
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:57,149
DOCTOR 3: He needs broad spectrum coverage.

KEYS: Elliott.

838
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,391
I've been to the forest.

MILITARY DOCTOR: He shouldn't talk now.

840
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:16,154
Well, he has to talk now, Major.

841
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:20,477
Elliott, that machine...

842
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,916
...what does it do?

843
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,351
[Gasps] The communicator?

844
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:30,190
Is it still working?

845
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:32,631
KEYS: It's doing something.

846
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:35,159
What?

847
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,791
I really shouldn't tell.

848
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,631
[Breathlessly] He came to me.

849
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,031
He came to me.

850
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:46,799
Elliott, he came to me, too.

851
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:51,351
I've been wishing for this
since I was 10 years old.

852
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:54,156
I don't want him to die.

853
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:57,479
What can we do that we're not already doing?

854
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,994
He needs to go home.

855
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:04,790
He's calling his people...

856
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,075
...and I don't know where they are.

857
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,116
<i>He needs to go home.</i>

858
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:16,749
Elliott, I don't think
that he was left here intentionally.

859
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:22,359
But his being here is a miracle, Elliott.

860
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,712
It's a miracle...

861
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:29,553
...and you did the best that anybody could do.

862
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,756
I'm glad he met you first.

863
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:45,075
DOCTOR: He's got DNA.

864
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,953
DOCTOR: He's got DNA.
ALL: DNA?

865
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:50,679
DOCTOR: He doesn't have four nucleotides like
we do. He has six.

866
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:53,752
DOCTOR 2: I've got de-synchronization
of the two brain wave activities.

867

E.T.!

FEMALE DOCTOR: How's the boy?

887
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:55,394
He's converting back to normal sinus rhythm.

DOCTOR 3: They're separating.
Boy and creature are separating.

DOCTOR: Boy's coming back. We're losing E.T.

Calm down. Calm.

Let's try some bretylium.
Can we have some bretylium?

910
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:14,199
Getting a pulse?

911

FEMALE DOCTOR:
Compressed air. Compressed air's fine.

912
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:24,992
His pupils are fixed and dilated.

913
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,677
Defibrillate him.

-They're going to die.
-Shut up, Greg.

I think so, sweetheart.

Yeah.

The intravenous line should be sent for culture.

947
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,994
He was monitored with a...

<i>...EEG and an EKG, he was defibrillated....</i>

They'll just cut him all up.
