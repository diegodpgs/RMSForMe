1
00:01:47,986 --> 00:01:51,513
Come on. Let's go, guys.
I'm missing the Oscars.

2
00:02:21,553 --> 00:02:22,850
Hey, Calabrese, nice to see you again.

3
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:26,057
- This is the friend I told you about.
- Good to meet you.

4
00:02:26,224 --> 00:02:27,885
Calabrese...

5
00:02:28,627 --> 00:02:30,060
...I know you.

6
00:02:30,295 --> 00:02:32,627
Who are these other mystery guests?

7
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:39,164
Murder is a very serious
business, my friend.

8
00:02:39,938 --> 00:02:41,963
And an expensive one.

9
00:02:42,574 --> 00:02:45,737
You'll be very well compensated,
Mr. Calabrese.

10
00:02:45,977 --> 00:02:48,810
Money now, and a lot more
when I get in that office.

11
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:50,742
You can take that to the bank.

12
00:02:51,149 --> 00:02:53,140
Slowly. Slowly.

13
00:02:53,985 --> 00:02:55,748
And always with caution.

14
00:02:55,987 --> 00:03:00,048
Listen to me! I want you to turn
Senator Caldwell into a memory.

15
00:03:00,258 --> 00:03:03,318
I'm not waiting for him
to die of natural causes.

16
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:06,820
All I'm counseling is a little patience.

17
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:10,591
The man is public.
He's in the papers every day.

18
00:03:10,802 --> 00:03:13,635
Next time I read about him,
I want it in the obituaries.

19
00:03:14,172 --> 00:03:15,833
Who are you?

20
00:03:16,508 --> 00:03:18,135
Get out of the shadows.

21
00:03:18,343 --> 00:03:19,674
Enough bullshit.

22
00:03:19,945 --> 00:03:21,936
Can you do the job or not?

23
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,411
If you can't...

24
00:03:23,515 --> 00:03:24,174
We'll do it.

25
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,011
Gentlemen, enough bickering.

26
00:03:27,252 --> 00:03:28,685
This is business.

27
00:03:30,522 --> 00:03:32,183
We understand each other.

28
00:03:33,892 --> 00:03:35,883
Then let's just stick to business.

29
00:03:39,297 --> 00:03:40,594
It's a light plane.

30
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:42,960
A Lear P-61.

31
00:03:43,468 --> 00:03:45,265
We want it to take off,

32
00:03:45,437 --> 00:03:47,530
but we don't want it to land.

33
00:03:56,715 --> 00:03:58,706
You told me this dock was clean.

34
00:04:09,661 --> 00:04:13,153
Mikey! Quit playing
with yourself back there.

35
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,670
Get that bastard!

36
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:52,229
I don't want him to get an hour older!

37
00:04:52,437 --> 00:04:54,530
He won't, Mr. Assemblyman.

38
00:04:57,943 --> 00:04:59,604
No kidding.

39
00:05:00,445 --> 00:05:04,438
- And the winner is...
- Ben Kingsley for "Gandhi!"

40
00:05:07,118 --> 00:05:08,710
Amigo, are you deaf?

41
00:05:09,888 --> 00:05:11,549
Storm on three.

42
00:05:13,725 --> 00:05:14,783
Line 3.

43
00:05:15,894 --> 00:05:17,555
Throwing away dimes now?

44
00:05:17,896 --> 00:05:20,797
This doesn't go out.
For your ears only.

45
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:27,060
What?

46
00:05:27,305 --> 00:05:29,603
Calabrese.
I got his ass on film.

47
00:05:29,941 --> 00:05:31,431
You're full of shit.

48
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,213
Him and his pet cockroach, Valerio.
On film and audio, laying out a hit.

49
00:05:36,414 --> 00:05:40,214
Two guys I couldn't make out,
but I think they'll come up on the film.

50
00:05:40,418 --> 00:05:44,650
I think this is the big one.
Our own little Academy Award.

51
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:46,747
It's good. Ready?

52
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:49,227
- Shoot.
- Listen, Carlito.

53
00:05:50,161 --> 00:05:52,391
Nobody but us knows about this.

54
00:06:02,507 --> 00:06:05,340
- How you doing tonight?
- What can I do for you?

55
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,271
Got champagne?

56
00:06:08,847 --> 00:06:11,008
Right next to the caviar.

57
00:06:11,783 --> 00:06:13,512
- That was funny.
- Great.

58
00:06:13,785 --> 00:06:16,117
In the big cooler in back.

59
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:19,422
How come you're not watching
the Oscars tonight?

60
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:24,427
I hate the Oscars.

61
00:06:24,663 --> 00:06:26,290
You're not having a good time?

62
00:06:26,531 --> 00:06:29,125
Who needs the goddamn movies?

63
00:06:30,368 --> 00:06:32,859
I got a show in here every night.

64
00:06:33,271 --> 00:06:34,863
I got horror, sex...

65
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,531
...freaks, violence.

66
00:06:38,543 --> 00:06:40,875
And I don't have to pay no 4 bucks.

67
00:06:41,713 --> 00:06:44,477
You should film it.
Get your own show.

68
00:06:44,749 --> 00:06:46,717
l'll be great in a porno.

69
00:06:51,056 --> 00:06:52,648
Better dial 911.

70
00:06:53,158 --> 00:06:55,820
You don't want to call 911.

71
00:06:56,394 --> 00:06:58,055
Holy shit!

72
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:02,065
You remember me, viejo?

73
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:05,996
You remember.

74
00:07:06,338 --> 00:07:08,898
He grew some hair
since we last seen him.

75
00:07:10,241 --> 00:07:11,299
Where's the rug?

76
00:07:14,913 --> 00:07:16,540
You know what I want.
Go ahead!

77
00:07:16,748 --> 00:07:18,079
Move!

78
00:07:24,255 --> 00:07:26,120
Take my life savings.

79
00:07:27,859 --> 00:07:29,690
Where's a cop when you need one?

80
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:33,288
They're out eating doughnuts.

81
00:07:36,901 --> 00:07:39,529
I got half a mind to bash your...

82
00:07:45,276 --> 00:07:47,369
Now you only got half a mind.

83
00:07:51,883 --> 00:07:53,282
Let's go, hero!

84
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:56,452
That's it, right here.
What are you grinning at?

85
00:07:56,721 --> 00:07:57,881
You know...

86
00:07:58,957 --> 00:08:01,118
...there's only four of you guys...

87
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:04,357
...and you only have
one shot left in here.

88
00:08:17,142 --> 00:08:18,632
Go low, man!

89
00:08:19,844 --> 00:08:21,539
Get the maricon, man!

90
00:08:24,215 --> 00:08:26,342
Get off the floor!
Get him!

91
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,721
l'll cut your heart out!

92
00:08:35,994 --> 00:08:38,485
Yeah? Come and cut my heart out!

93
00:08:39,998 --> 00:08:41,829
Come and cut my heart out.

94
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:43,657
Come on, punk.

95
00:08:43,935 --> 00:08:47,837
I know what you're thinking.
Mine's bigger than yours.

96
00:08:48,106 --> 00:08:49,596
It's not fair.

97
00:08:49,841 --> 00:08:51,331
l'll throw it away.

98
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,770
What if I show you
what it's like to be a victim?

99
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,441
- Come on.
- You're fucking dead, man!

100
00:09:01,686 --> 00:09:05,520
It's still not fair.
Okay, l'll get down on my knees.

101
00:09:05,857 --> 00:09:07,119
Better?

102
00:09:09,194 --> 00:09:10,354
Come on.

103
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:20,203
Looks like you won the Oscar, Storm.

104
00:09:40,191 --> 00:09:42,682
You'll be very well compensated,
Mr. Calabrese.

105
00:09:42,894 --> 00:09:45,158
And there's more
when I get in that office.

106
00:09:45,363 --> 00:09:46,990
You can take that to the bank.

107
00:09:47,232 --> 00:09:48,790
I know that voice.

108
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,907
Is that you, honey?

109
00:10:37,715 --> 00:10:40,707
Yeah, baby.
In the flesh.

110
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:57,959
What are you doing?
Come on.

111
00:10:58,236 --> 00:11:00,067
I'm raiding the icebox.

112
00:11:00,305 --> 00:11:02,796
I gave up my diet for Lent.

113
00:11:06,978 --> 00:11:08,411
Champagne?

114
00:11:09,647 --> 00:11:11,979
Does that put you in the mood?

115
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:15,312
Think this could do it?

116
00:11:24,262 --> 00:11:26,890
I had to bribe him to go to bed
with six cookies...

117
00:11:27,098 --> 00:11:28,929
...and a glass of orange juice.

118
00:11:34,072 --> 00:11:36,006
I wish I could sleep like that.

119
00:11:36,474 --> 00:11:38,203
Maybe I can help you.

120
00:11:38,843 --> 00:11:41,175
Is that for me, Dad?

121
00:11:42,513 --> 00:11:44,037
You faker.

122
00:11:48,353 --> 00:11:49,513
Here you go.

123
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:51,852
There you go.

124
00:11:52,457 --> 00:11:56,951
- Did you say your prayers?
- I wanted to do them with you.

125
00:11:57,795 --> 00:11:59,660
You know there's a trick...

126
00:12:00,365 --> 00:12:02,697
...to getting what you want
in your prayers.

127
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:08,629
You ask for things for other people,
like your mom and Uncle O'Malley.

128
00:12:08,973 --> 00:12:12,136
Then how do I get stuff for myself?

129
00:12:12,477 --> 00:12:15,139
That's why God invented work.

130
00:12:16,047 --> 00:12:18,447
Want to say a little prayer with me?
Come here.

131
00:12:20,551 --> 00:12:22,212
Want to say your prayers?

132
00:12:23,054 --> 00:12:24,715
Now I lay me down to sleep...

133
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:27,849
And we say together.

134
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:30,721
...I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

135
00:12:31,162 --> 00:12:33,653
If I die before I wake...

136
00:12:33,898 --> 00:12:36,833
...I pray the Lord my soul to take.

137
00:12:37,835 --> 00:12:38,995
Very good.

138
00:12:46,344 --> 00:12:48,005
Good night, Dad.

139
00:12:50,915 --> 00:12:52,576
Sleep well, champ.

140
00:12:57,055 --> 00:12:58,522
Here's to us.

141
00:13:11,102 --> 00:13:12,763
I had a shitty day.

142
00:13:18,876 --> 00:13:20,537
There's blood on your shirt.

143
00:13:20,778 --> 00:13:22,439
It's not my blood.

144
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,714
So you don't have to worry.

145
00:13:34,058 --> 00:13:36,549
If people knew how sweet you are...

146
00:13:37,628 --> 00:13:39,619
...they'd never be scared of you.

147
00:13:46,137 --> 00:13:47,604
I'm not scared of you.

148
00:13:48,072 --> 00:13:49,801
Maybe you should be.

149
00:14:07,925 --> 00:14:09,222
I'm in a silly mood.

150
00:14:29,847 --> 00:14:31,280
I love you.

151
00:14:32,016 --> 00:14:33,677
I love you, too.

152
00:15:33,911 --> 00:15:35,242
I'm ready.

153
00:15:36,914 --> 00:15:37,710
What?

154
00:15:47,725 --> 00:15:48,657
Motherfuckers!

155
00:15:57,935 --> 00:15:59,027
Mason!

156
00:16:02,773 --> 00:16:04,263
Sweet dreams.

157
00:16:21,058 --> 00:16:22,685
Becker! Storm on three!

158
00:16:36,641 --> 00:16:40,133
I got the coke on the dresser.
Put yours in the nightstand.

159
00:16:41,212 --> 00:16:42,406
I got it.

160
00:16:50,321 --> 00:16:51,811
Got all the tapes?

161
00:16:52,924 --> 00:16:54,653
A shitload. Hurry!

162
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,148
Just hurry!

163
00:16:59,797 --> 00:17:00,764
The kid!

164
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:05,898
Get that kid and kill him!

165
00:17:17,014 --> 00:17:18,675
That fucking Storm!

166
00:17:19,016 --> 00:17:22,008
Get your ass in the van
and stop complaining.

167
00:17:23,854 --> 00:17:27,017
- What the fuck happened?
- Another dead asshole! Let's go!

168
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:38,593
Assemblyman Trent,
when did you meet Mason Storm?

169
00:17:38,803 --> 00:17:41,033
I've known him since I was...

170
00:17:41,305 --> 00:17:42,704
Jesus Christ!

171
00:17:43,074 --> 00:17:45,167
...City Attorney and...

172
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,371
...he was a young...

173
00:17:48,045 --> 00:17:49,808
...homicide detective.

174
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:52,542
We worked together...

175
00:17:55,553 --> 00:17:57,487
...on several cases.

176
00:17:57,888 --> 00:18:00,220
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

177
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:06,059
Assemblyman Vernon Trent, distraught
over the loss of an officer he knew.

178
00:18:07,932 --> 00:18:11,561
A terrible set of circumstances
here outside the emergency room...

179
00:18:11,836 --> 00:18:15,829
...and a calamity-filled
mob scene of policemen...

180
00:18:16,507 --> 00:18:17,974
What makes people do this?

181
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:21,605
Would somebody please tell me that!

182
00:18:24,915 --> 00:18:25,904
Hulland!

183
00:18:26,584 --> 00:18:27,573
Captain Hulland!

184
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:37,088
Is he a national treasure?

185
00:18:45,603 --> 00:18:48,094
You know they always said
Storm was superhuman.

186
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:50,930
That's because he was always
jacked up on coke.

187
00:18:52,576 --> 00:18:55,340
You listen to me.
I'm going to tell you something.

188
00:18:55,546 --> 00:19:00,108
He was clean. He had more honor
than this whole department put together.

189
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:03,284
If I ever hear you
talk that puke again...

190
00:19:03,554 --> 00:19:05,749
...l'll put you where you belong.

191
00:19:05,956 --> 00:19:08,186
What the fuck is I.A. doing here?

192
00:19:08,392 --> 00:19:10,360
- Taking over the show.
- Bullshit!

193
00:19:10,561 --> 00:19:12,893
This is Homicide, not Internal Affairs.

194
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,690
We got 2 cops down,
money and drugs everywhere.

195
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,731
This is from the Commissioner.

196
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,368
Capt. Hulland?

197
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,330
Storm is dead.

198
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:38,849
O'Malley...

199
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,622
...I know you and Storm were tight.

200
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:49,960
For what it's worth...

201
00:19:51,702 --> 00:19:53,033
...I'm sorry.

202
00:19:54,805 --> 00:19:57,865
The most unstoppable
son-of-a-bitch I ever knew.

203
00:20:00,044 --> 00:20:01,978
He got stopped tonight.

204
00:20:12,223 --> 00:20:14,555
Excuse me.
Are you with the police?

205
00:20:14,892 --> 00:20:17,053
Lt. O'Malley.
What do you got?

206
00:20:17,328 --> 00:20:19,660
A live cop is what I've got.

207
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:25,562
- Lieutenant, what's happening?
- No comment. It's over.

208
00:20:30,007 --> 00:20:31,406
We got a pulse.

209
00:20:31,675 --> 00:20:33,734
Your man's alive, Lieutenant.

210
00:20:34,345 --> 00:20:36,506
Who else knows he isn't dead?

211
00:20:36,747 --> 00:20:38,408
Just the people in here.

212
00:20:38,682 --> 00:20:40,673
I want to see each of them.

213
00:20:40,918 --> 00:20:44,581
And no one else comes in here
as of now. You got that?

214
00:20:50,694 --> 00:20:53,254
Lieutenant, this is still a hospital.

215
00:20:53,531 --> 00:20:55,522
I appreciate your problem.

216
00:20:55,766 --> 00:20:58,758
But I'm acting under orders
of the police commissioner.

217
00:20:59,036 --> 00:21:01,869
- I hope you can document that.
- I can and will.

218
00:21:03,107 --> 00:21:07,942
Mason Storm's going to vanish,
and you'll help make that happen.

219
00:21:08,379 --> 00:21:12,816
Until he can give us some answers,
the deader he is, the safer he is.

220
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:29,565
Don't worry, buddy, I'm in your corner.

221
00:21:40,644 --> 00:21:42,635
...and you can take that to the bank.

222
00:21:45,316 --> 00:21:48,649
The governor today appointed
Assemblyman Vernon Trent...

223
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:53,583
...to the Senate seat vacated
by the tragic death of Senator Caldwell.

224
00:21:55,326 --> 00:22:00,263
Your support fuels my efforts
and inspires me to work even harder.

225
00:22:00,664 --> 00:22:03,326
I will not tolerate crime in this state.

226
00:22:03,767 --> 00:22:06,167
And you can take that to the bank!

227
00:22:24,054 --> 00:22:25,715
It's 6 A.M.

228
00:22:25,956 --> 00:22:27,184
Morning, Martha.

229
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:31,124
What do we got here?
Inquiring minds want to know.

230
00:22:31,362 --> 00:22:35,526
Doctor Carlin's ordered
a glucose drip for Jimmy C.

231
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:39,428
Max's E.E.G. monitor's
developing a nice electronic hiccup.

232
00:22:39,637 --> 00:22:41,127
Poor Max.

233
00:22:41,372 --> 00:22:44,205
And your boyfriend turned his head.

234
00:22:44,475 --> 00:22:45,806
He did?

235
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:50,203
I thought he was going to sit up.
I almost shit.

236
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:55,212
See you for a cup of tea
in a few minutes.

237
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:02,616
I knew it.

238
00:23:15,572 --> 00:23:18,666
You moved your head today,
you little devil.

239
00:23:19,076 --> 00:23:21,670
Let's see,
what can I do for you here?

240
00:23:27,251 --> 00:23:28,741
Very nice!

241
00:23:31,021 --> 00:23:32,181
Great.

242
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:36,081
I've got a little surprise for you.

243
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,759
Be right back.

244
00:23:42,933 --> 00:23:45,424
Would you like a little pussy?

245
00:23:45,703 --> 00:23:49,036
A little bitty pussy.
Look what I've got here.

246
00:23:55,946 --> 00:23:58,039
John Doe, can you hear me?

247
00:23:59,283 --> 00:24:03,879
I know my words are getting through.
I don't care what the doctors say.

248
00:24:04,722 --> 00:24:07,623
I'm going to keep
talking to you today...

249
00:24:08,225 --> 00:24:12,218
...and tomorrow and the day after,
till you respond.

250
00:24:13,797 --> 00:24:16,630
Besides, you've got so much to live for.

251
00:24:17,735 --> 00:24:19,703
Please wake up!

252
00:24:22,072 --> 00:24:24,336
Got to go see Jimmy C.

253
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:27,570
Bye.

254
00:26:20,023 --> 00:26:21,581
Stupid machine.

255
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:23,419
Nurse.

256
00:26:24,027 --> 00:26:25,221
Nurse.

257
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,033
We need to run some tests.
Alert X-ray for a CAT scan.

258
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:36,433
Call the lab.
We need a complete blood work-up.

259
00:26:50,787 --> 00:26:52,118
John Doe.

260
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,289
Here we are.

261
00:27:00,898 --> 00:27:03,560
Internal Affairs.
Detective Sergeant Goodhart.

262
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,134
My name's Andrea Stewart. I'm calling
from the L.A. Coma Research Center.

263
00:27:08,472 --> 00:27:11,407
I'd like to speak to
Captain O'Malley, please.

264
00:27:12,142 --> 00:27:14,133
What is this in regards to?

265
00:27:14,478 --> 00:27:17,811
I have a John Doe coma patient,
code access 461-Zebra...

266
00:27:18,015 --> 00:27:21,314
...with instructions to notify
in case of change in condition.

267
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,250
What's the change?

268
00:27:23,654 --> 00:27:26,748
The patient has come out
of a coma after 7 years.

269
00:27:27,491 --> 00:27:29,652
Nolan, get Hulland, quick.

270
00:27:34,364 --> 00:27:38,391
I'm sorry, Captain O'Malley's
no longer with this division.

271
00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:40,168
l'll take the information.

272
00:27:40,437 --> 00:27:43,600
And please, contact
no one else on this matter.

273
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,331
It would be better
for the patient's welfare.

274
00:27:47,578 --> 00:27:50,672
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

275
00:27:51,181 --> 00:27:54,947
President Bush has caught
the public eye with his antics.

276
00:27:55,185 --> 00:27:57,847
From throwing the first ball
on opening day...

277
00:27:58,121 --> 00:28:01,113
...to kissing a pig
for the farmer's affections.

278
00:28:01,358 --> 00:28:04,350
George Bush is becoming
a real crowd pleaser.

279
00:28:05,028 --> 00:28:08,862
This is Andrew Louis
for Cable Hospital News.

280
00:28:16,306 --> 00:28:18,206
What year is it?

281
00:28:19,209 --> 00:28:22,542
- Try not to talk.
- What year is it?

282
00:28:22,879 --> 00:28:24,471
It's 1990.

283
00:28:28,118 --> 00:28:30,643
Your charts go back for 7 years.

284
00:28:31,288 --> 00:28:33,722
Do you have any recollection
of anything?

285
00:28:37,394 --> 00:28:39,487
I remember everything.

286
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:44,062
You're the first patient
to come out of a coma of this duration.

287
00:28:44,501 --> 00:28:46,901
You'll be famous.
You'll be on the news.

288
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:49,161
Listen to me very carefully.

289
00:28:49,673 --> 00:28:51,163
I'm a cop.

290
00:28:52,909 --> 00:28:55,571
My wife and family were murdered.

291
00:28:56,013 --> 00:28:58,004
That's how I got here.

292
00:28:59,416 --> 00:29:02,749
If you don't get me out
of this hospital...

293
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,421
...within an hour, we'll both be dead.

294
00:29:06,757 --> 00:29:09,021
You're my cutest patient,
but not my only one.

295
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:11,750
- You're making a mistake.
- L'll be back.

296
00:29:12,029 --> 00:29:14,190
No. Don't go.

297
00:29:21,872 --> 00:29:23,499
How's it going, brother?

298
00:29:24,441 --> 00:29:25,499
Who are you?

299
00:29:25,776 --> 00:29:30,440
I'm Danny, the physical therapist.
I'm going to give you a massage.

300
00:29:30,781 --> 00:29:33,375
- L'll make you feel all right.
- Get the fuck out.

301
00:29:33,617 --> 00:29:35,847
l'll just take you down the hall.

302
00:29:44,895 --> 00:29:48,956
Can I see your list of patients
in your coma care unit?

303
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:58,634
Get me out. Thanks for the massage,
but stop and get me out of here.

304
00:29:58,975 --> 00:30:02,376
Just relax. You'll get out
of here real soon, I promise.

305
00:30:03,146 --> 00:30:05,307
Morning, Sherry.
How you doing?

306
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:11,449
Thanks.

307
00:30:12,522 --> 00:30:13,511
Thank you.

308
00:30:19,496 --> 00:30:22,090
- You know that doctor?
- No.

309
00:31:58,028 --> 00:31:59,689
John Doe.

310
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:14,536
Excuse me.
Doctor?

311
00:32:17,113 --> 00:32:19,775
I have to check everyone
on these floors.

312
00:32:21,117 --> 00:32:22,914
Can I get your I.D., please?

313
00:32:23,787 --> 00:32:26,119
You can't have too much security.

314
00:32:32,729 --> 00:32:37,325
If you feel up to it, l'll get you some
lemon chiffon pie out of the freezer.

315
00:32:37,567 --> 00:32:39,034
Get me out of here.

316
00:32:39,236 --> 00:32:41,397
Don't worry.
l'll take good care of you.

317
00:32:41,638 --> 00:32:44,129
If you want, l'll hook you up
with some pizza.

318
00:32:44,474 --> 00:32:46,635
You got to learn to relax.

319
00:32:46,977 --> 00:32:49,309
Orderly!
Give me a little help.

320
00:32:50,981 --> 00:32:52,812
Give me some help down here.

321
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:01,752
What's wrong?

322
00:33:02,325 --> 00:33:04,657
Russ! Russ!
What happened?

323
00:33:05,962 --> 00:33:06,929
He's dead.

324
00:33:15,672 --> 00:33:17,503
My poor back.

325
00:34:01,051 --> 00:34:02,643
You son-of-a-bitch!

326
00:34:10,727 --> 00:34:12,888
Stop, you son-of-a-bitch!

327
00:34:35,051 --> 00:34:36,177
Oh, my God!

328
00:34:36,386 --> 00:34:38,047
Russ! Danny!

329
00:35:15,392 --> 00:35:17,383
l'll get you, Storm!

330
00:35:41,584 --> 00:35:42,573
J.D.!

331
00:35:42,986 --> 00:35:44,283
Oh, my God!

332
00:35:46,489 --> 00:35:48,423
Now will you listen to me?

333
00:35:54,698 --> 00:35:55,926
Hold tight!

334
00:35:58,034 --> 00:35:58,966
Sorry.

335
00:36:00,437 --> 00:36:01,426
Stop!

336
00:36:02,305 --> 00:36:03,033
Hang on!

337
00:36:10,613 --> 00:36:11,910
Watch out!

338
00:37:15,411 --> 00:37:18,574
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are going to put a stop to it...

339
00:37:18,848 --> 00:37:21,749
...and we're going to start right here!

340
00:37:25,755 --> 00:37:27,916
We are going to put an end...

341
00:37:28,258 --> 00:37:32,922
...to violence in this state,
and you can take that to the bank!

342
00:37:37,767 --> 00:37:40,600
Hulland, plaster Storm's ass
with slime in the press.

343
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:44,863
Make him responsible for that mess
at the hospital. Tail people he knows.

344
00:37:45,108 --> 00:37:46,769
We know how to do our job.

345
00:37:47,043 --> 00:37:50,706
Then show me. I'm starring in the
son-of-a-bitch's home movies.

346
00:37:50,947 --> 00:37:54,110
If that crap gets out,
I'm looking at 30 years.

347
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:45,664
As many of you already know...

348
00:38:46,169 --> 00:38:47,329
Geraldo.

349
00:38:48,771 --> 00:38:50,238
Who's this guy?

350
00:38:50,506 --> 00:38:53,942
...our program came to an
unexpectedly violent conclusion.

351
00:39:12,629 --> 00:39:17,692
Are you crazy? I can't come in to work.
I can't even go to my apartment, Martha.

352
00:39:18,201 --> 00:39:20,032
People are dead.

353
00:39:20,303 --> 00:39:21,497
Then where are you?

354
00:39:21,704 --> 00:39:24,935
I can't tell you.
Besides, you're better off not knowing.

355
00:39:32,181 --> 00:39:36,675
The people's candidate, Senator
Vernon Trent, promises no new taxes.

356
00:39:36,953 --> 00:39:39,046
And you can take that to the bank.

357
00:39:43,493 --> 00:39:46,621
What am I going to do with this guy?
I want to help him...

358
00:39:46,863 --> 00:39:50,924
...but he's all over TV. He's some kind
of crooked cop involved in...

359
00:39:54,504 --> 00:39:55,971
Why are you out of bed?

360
00:39:56,539 --> 00:39:57,699
I've got you.

361
00:39:58,141 --> 00:39:59,802
Police speculate that Storm...

362
00:40:00,043 --> 00:40:04,207
...who is known to have ties
with criminal elements...

363
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,381
...could have involved
his contacts in his escape.

364
00:40:07,717 --> 00:40:11,050
Storm was thought to have been
a murder victim. A casualty...

365
00:40:11,321 --> 00:40:14,188
...of his own greed.
A widespread search is now being...

366
00:40:19,395 --> 00:40:22,887
This is Mason Storm. I'd like
to speak with Jerry Dunphy, please.

367
00:40:25,668 --> 00:40:28,000
No, it's not a joke.

368
00:40:31,174 --> 00:40:34,371
We can't stay here.
They'll trace us from the hospital.

369
00:40:34,744 --> 00:40:38,236
Nobody knows I'm here.
I'm house-sitting.

370
00:40:38,581 --> 00:40:41,414
This place belongs to
a doctor friend of my parents.

371
00:40:41,684 --> 00:40:44,380
He's in China on research for 6 months.

372
00:40:45,355 --> 00:40:47,983
The medical center
only has my apartment address.

373
00:40:48,257 --> 00:40:51,283
Not even my friends have this number.

374
00:40:52,428 --> 00:40:54,419
You've got to believe me.

375
00:40:54,931 --> 00:40:56,694
You're safe here, okay?

376
00:41:00,203 --> 00:41:03,195
This reporter was contacted personally
by the infamous...

377
00:41:03,439 --> 00:41:06,408
..."Coma Cop,"
fugitive officer Mason Storm...

378
00:41:06,709 --> 00:41:09,701
...who, until days ago,
had languished in a 7-year coma.

379
00:41:10,046 --> 00:41:14,710
Storm said he's innocent of all charges
proffered against him in the press...

380
00:41:14,951 --> 00:41:17,613
...and that he has
indisputable proof of this.

381
00:41:17,887 --> 00:41:21,550
He has promised me a first look
at his alleged proof.

382
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:26,460
I want 24-hour surveillance
on that son-of-a-bitch...

383
00:41:26,829 --> 00:41:29,127
...and those 2 nurses from the hospital.

384
00:41:39,609 --> 00:41:41,941
No, I can do it myself.

385
00:41:42,412 --> 00:41:44,073
You do it, then.

386
00:41:54,157 --> 00:41:55,886
You give me this beard?

387
00:42:06,803 --> 00:42:07,929
You tried.

388
00:42:18,281 --> 00:42:21,182
- You ever been to Chinatown?
- Yeah. Why?

389
00:42:23,386 --> 00:42:27,846
This is a list of herbs and needles
that I need for my recovery.

390
00:42:28,191 --> 00:42:30,489
Where did you learn to write Chinese?

391
00:42:32,028 --> 00:42:36,692
When I was a kid, my dad was a
missionary. I was raised in the Orient.

392
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,634
As a young white boy over there...

393
00:42:39,869 --> 00:42:43,464
...I needed to learn how to fight,
as you can imagine.

394
00:42:43,806 --> 00:42:44,966
I remember...

395
00:42:45,475 --> 00:42:48,308
...my first martial arts teacher
once said to me:

396
00:42:48,711 --> 00:42:51,043
"So why do you come to me?"

397
00:42:51,881 --> 00:42:53,974
I say,
"To learn how to fight."

398
00:42:54,217 --> 00:42:57,118
And he says,
"So you want to hurt people."

399
00:42:58,054 --> 00:43:00,818
"But do you want to be great?"
I say, "Yeah."

400
00:43:01,824 --> 00:43:03,655
"I want to be great."

401
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,224
He says, "Then first learn how
to heal people to be great."

402
00:43:09,899 --> 00:43:12,129
"To hurt people is easy."

403
00:43:33,523 --> 00:43:36,185
Look at you!
You look great.

404
00:43:36,425 --> 00:43:37,585
Like it?

405
00:43:50,439 --> 00:43:53,033
That's enough.
Why don't you go sit down?

406
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:04,552
That bad?

407
00:44:08,124 --> 00:44:10,718
If you need me,
l'll be in the outer room.

408
00:46:50,953 --> 00:46:53,046
O'Malley's the key.
We got to find him.

409
00:46:53,255 --> 00:46:57,555
You can't compare blood pressure
readings now with when you're in a coma.

410
00:46:57,793 --> 00:47:00,125
What's this?
555 over four digits.

411
00:47:00,363 --> 00:47:02,456
That's crazy.
Let me see that.

412
00:47:03,299 --> 00:47:06,632
Martha's chicken scratches.
She probably can't even read them.

413
00:47:06,902 --> 00:47:08,233
Know what it is?

414
00:47:08,904 --> 00:47:10,462
It's a phone number.

415
00:47:35,765 --> 00:47:37,062
After you phoned...

416
00:47:38,667 --> 00:47:41,192
...I asked everyone here at the home...

417
00:47:42,004 --> 00:47:45,872
...and there is no O'Malley here.
But it is possible that...

418
00:47:47,009 --> 00:47:50,001
...O'Malley is a relation
of someone here.

419
00:47:50,679 --> 00:47:55,514
Why don't you leave me your number and
l'll call you if there's any contact.

420
00:47:57,286 --> 00:47:58,685
Can I phone you?

421
00:47:59,855 --> 00:48:01,516
Of course, my dear.

422
00:48:03,025 --> 00:48:05,892
- Here, let me do that.
- That's all right.

423
00:48:32,054 --> 00:48:33,544
You old devil.

424
00:48:59,849 --> 00:49:01,874
Mason Storm.

425
00:50:09,752 --> 00:50:11,743
Hi. I'm sorry.

426
00:50:12,988 --> 00:50:15,320
I don't mean to interrupt.

427
00:50:16,425 --> 00:50:19,053
I was just passing by and I thought...

428
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:22,761
...you might like a flower.

429
00:51:21,323 --> 00:51:23,154
I like that.

430
00:52:24,787 --> 00:52:27,347
Now I lay me down to sleep...

431
00:52:29,291 --> 00:52:31,122
Now we say it together, okay?

432
00:52:31,627 --> 00:52:34,460
...I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

433
00:52:34,897 --> 00:52:37,229
If I die before I wake...

434
00:52:37,466 --> 00:52:40,299
...I pray the Lord my soul to take.

435
00:52:51,246 --> 00:52:54,113
This is Martha Coe.
I can't come to the phone...

436
00:52:54,316 --> 00:52:56,750
Pick up, Martha.
Please pick up.

437
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,379
Are you there?
I'm coming over.

438
00:53:18,941 --> 00:53:20,932
Are you there?
I'm coming over.

439
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:23,510
You called it right, Axel.

440
00:53:24,346 --> 00:53:26,177
Our girlfriend just showed up.

441
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,725
Martha, open up.
It's me.

442
00:53:52,107 --> 00:53:53,131
What's up?

443
00:53:55,144 --> 00:53:56,406
Looking for Martha?

444
00:53:56,879 --> 00:53:58,369
You know where she is?

445
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:02,481
Haven't seen the news?

446
00:54:04,486 --> 00:54:05,976
She's dead.

447
00:54:07,322 --> 00:54:09,984
She was strangled over in Westwood.

448
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:12,592
Know something?

449
00:54:13,662 --> 00:54:16,153
You look like the bitch
whose picture's on TV.

450
00:54:19,168 --> 00:54:21,659
The one whose house they found her at.

451
00:54:22,004 --> 00:54:23,596
Hey, get over here!

452
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:30,241
Okay, boys, mount up.

453
00:54:49,865 --> 00:54:52,698
Ernie, you forgot my buttermilk.

454
00:54:53,035 --> 00:54:54,024
Shit!

455
00:55:23,065 --> 00:55:24,623
O'Malley.

456
00:55:42,484 --> 00:55:44,475
That's Sonny, all right.

457
00:55:45,587 --> 00:55:47,111
The kid's a track star.

458
00:55:47,322 --> 00:55:49,654
He does the hundred in 11 flat.

459
00:55:50,058 --> 00:55:53,323
He's going to be real fast,
like his old man was.

460
00:55:53,662 --> 00:55:55,129
What do you mean "was?"

461
00:55:55,998 --> 00:55:57,829
I'm not over the hill.

462
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,161
At least, I hope not.

463
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:03,262
How'd pull this off?

464
00:56:04,673 --> 00:56:07,233
He made it to my house
the night you were shot.

465
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:11,343
I got him hidden, played it out
like he was dead...

466
00:56:11,813 --> 00:56:14,281
...staged his funeral
with yours and Felicia's.

467
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:16,274
Everybody bought it.

468
00:56:19,688 --> 00:56:22,179
Where is he?
Is he safe?

469
00:56:22,658 --> 00:56:26,617
Ventura Trinity Prep School,
under my mother's maiden name, Wade.

470
00:56:27,195 --> 00:56:29,720
No one has any idea that he's your son.

471
00:56:30,165 --> 00:56:32,326
So that was your mother that Andy found.

472
00:56:32,801 --> 00:56:37,295
Your nurse friend? Yeah.
She left a number and I traced you here.

473
00:56:43,312 --> 00:56:45,439
I don't know how to thank you.

474
00:56:46,214 --> 00:56:47,806
I have no words.

475
00:56:49,217 --> 00:56:51,879
Just seeing your ugly ass alive
is enough for me.

476
00:57:05,067 --> 00:57:06,728
That night in the hospital...

477
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:11,004
...I found the audio tape in your vest.

478
00:57:11,907 --> 00:57:14,569
I must've played that tape 1000 times...

479
00:57:14,843 --> 00:57:19,405
...Iooking for little quirks
in the voices, phrases that repeat.

480
00:57:19,715 --> 00:57:20,739
Nada.

481
00:57:21,016 --> 00:57:22,574
Where is the tape?

482
00:57:22,851 --> 00:57:25,012
- I turned it in for evidence.
- What?

483
00:57:25,253 --> 00:57:26,720
Don't worry, I made a dupe.

484
00:57:27,022 --> 00:57:29,923
Meanwhile, I thought you'd
take some pleasure in this.

485
00:57:32,194 --> 00:57:33,752
And there's more in the car.

486
00:57:35,364 --> 00:57:37,525
You were not wrong, my friend.

487
00:57:38,934 --> 00:57:40,526
You were not wrong.

488
00:57:49,444 --> 00:57:51,105
What's happened to you?

489
00:58:03,325 --> 00:58:06,089
I'd been on the case
maybe a year and a half...

490
00:58:06,294 --> 00:58:08,694
...trying to find out
who pulled the trigger.

491
00:58:10,065 --> 00:58:12,192
But it was like swimming through shit.

492
00:58:12,401 --> 00:58:16,565
Everywhere I turned,
people told me to back off, get lost.

493
00:58:17,906 --> 00:58:19,897
Then one morning the phone rings.

494
00:58:20,242 --> 00:58:22,233
Immaculate Heart Emergency.

495
00:58:23,578 --> 00:58:25,739
Someone ran my mother off the road.

496
00:58:26,248 --> 00:58:28,910
Her back's broken.
She's paralyzed.

497
00:58:30,285 --> 00:58:32,185
I'm sorry, O'Mal.

498
00:58:34,756 --> 00:58:39,591
That night, there's a note in my locker
letting me know it's not an accident.

499
00:58:41,029 --> 00:58:42,690
What the hell could I do?

500
00:58:42,931 --> 00:58:46,594
I'm there with my hands tied
behind my back. I can't wave or salute.

501
00:58:48,103 --> 00:58:50,094
So, I put my papers in.

502
00:58:51,606 --> 00:58:53,437
Took a 3/4 pension.

503
00:58:54,876 --> 00:58:57,367
You know me,
I never would have backed off.

504
00:58:57,946 --> 00:59:01,848
But there was Sonny to worry about.
What if they found him?

505
00:59:03,051 --> 00:59:05,246
- Or you?
- No, you did the right thing.

506
00:59:05,454 --> 00:59:08,617
Then wasn't the time.
Now's the time.

507
00:59:09,257 --> 00:59:13,250
We're outgunned and undermanned, but you
know something? We're going to win.

508
00:59:13,562 --> 00:59:15,223
And l'll tell you why.

509
00:59:15,564 --> 00:59:19,091
Superior attitude.
Superior state of mind.

510
00:59:23,071 --> 00:59:24,732
We'll get them, buddy.

511
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:26,573
Believe me.

512
00:59:35,317 --> 00:59:37,148
Every fucking one of them.

513
00:59:55,737 --> 01:00:00,174
Listen, O'Mal, one more favor.
Get Sonny out of that school now.

514
01:00:00,575 --> 01:00:04,841
With me up and running, these guys will
do anything to find Sonny to get to me.

515
01:00:05,347 --> 01:00:07,747
Get him some place safe, anywhere.

516
01:00:07,949 --> 01:00:09,610
Consider it done.

517
01:00:10,785 --> 01:00:12,912
I'm going straight to get that film.

518
01:00:13,121 --> 01:00:15,589
Soon as you get that audio,
and Sonny's safe...

519
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:17,985
...we'll bring it in to Jerry Dunphy.

520
01:00:18,193 --> 01:00:20,024
We'll see quite a show on the news.

521
01:00:20,862 --> 01:00:22,386
You got it, partner.

522
01:00:32,073 --> 01:00:34,564
I must've played that tape 1000 times...

523
01:00:34,776 --> 01:00:38,439
...Iooking for little quirks
in the voices, phrases that repeat.

524
01:00:39,648 --> 01:00:43,175
Two guys I couldn't make out,
but they'll come up on the film.

525
01:00:43,385 --> 01:00:46,115
- You can take that to the bank.
- I know that voice.

526
01:00:46,321 --> 01:00:51,156
Your charts go back 7 years. Do you
have any recollection of anything?

527
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:56,724
I have them on the same film in
the same camera, right where I left it.

528
01:00:57,065 --> 01:01:01,559
The people's candidate, Senator
Vernon Trent, promises no new taxes.

529
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:03,701
And you can take that to the bank.

530
01:01:07,342 --> 01:01:10,607
More money when I'm in office.
You can take that to the bank.

531
01:01:13,582 --> 01:01:16,676
I'm going to take you to the bank,
Senator Trent.

532
01:01:17,252 --> 01:01:19,015
To the blood bank.

533
01:01:54,789 --> 01:01:56,256
Martha's dead.

534
01:02:00,562 --> 01:02:01,494
I'm sorry.

535
01:02:12,641 --> 01:02:14,165
It's all right.

536
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:17,041
O'Malley was here today.

537
01:02:18,546 --> 01:02:21,709
He was?
How did he get here?

538
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:25,383
You found him.
The old lady was his mother.

539
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:31,622
My son's alive.

540
01:02:37,299 --> 01:02:40,291
We better get out of here.
Really. Let's go.

541
01:02:43,238 --> 01:02:45,729
This ain't going to be
my best packing job.

542
01:03:01,856 --> 01:03:03,221
Where are we going?

543
01:03:03,491 --> 01:03:04,924
Out of here.

544
01:03:16,071 --> 01:03:18,164
- Hurry up.
- I'm just about done.

545
01:03:21,643 --> 01:03:22,439
Mason!

546
01:03:31,519 --> 01:03:32,349
Down!

547
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:46,892
It's jammed!

548
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:22,994
Let's go.

549
01:04:37,886 --> 01:04:38,944
Get down!

550
01:04:47,595 --> 01:04:49,119
Come quick.
Let's go!

551
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:17,617
I'm gonna slit your throat!

552
01:05:17,826 --> 01:05:19,987
You're going to bleed like a pig!

553
01:05:20,728 --> 01:05:22,059
They're out back!

554
01:05:22,397 --> 01:05:24,297
We're on them.
Move!

555
01:05:59,767 --> 01:06:00,927
Hang on!

556
01:06:04,105 --> 01:06:06,266
Hulland!
You son-of-a-bitch!

557
01:06:41,309 --> 01:06:43,539
I forgot to lock the door.

558
01:07:03,398 --> 01:07:05,059
You like my coche?

559
01:07:07,235 --> 01:07:08,896
How hot is it, homes?

560
01:07:09,404 --> 01:07:10,735
Smoking.

561
01:07:14,008 --> 01:07:15,339
You got it.

562
01:07:40,768 --> 01:07:44,204
Maybe you should wear
these kind of clothes all the time.

563
01:07:44,405 --> 01:07:47,602
Only next time,
we'll use your credit card.

564
01:07:52,614 --> 01:07:54,445
Daddy, I don't want you to go.

565
01:07:57,285 --> 01:08:00,618
You look really great for someone
who changed in a gas station.

566
01:08:02,624 --> 01:08:07,459
We're from Hillstar Real Estate.
We can market your home effectively.

567
01:08:07,962 --> 01:08:10,795
We aren't even thinking about selling.

568
01:08:11,132 --> 01:08:12,861
In fact, we're adding a nursery.

569
01:08:13,301 --> 01:08:14,632
It's a mess.

570
01:08:14,902 --> 01:08:17,632
- I'd love to see the nursery.
- It's right over here.

571
01:08:17,905 --> 01:08:22,239
We don't know if it's a girl or a boy,
so we're doing a splatter effect.

572
01:08:32,987 --> 01:08:35,421
- What are you doing, hon?
- Raiding the icebox.

573
01:08:48,503 --> 01:08:50,903
I think the plasterer
fell off the ladder!

574
01:08:51,105 --> 01:08:52,572
What about your baby?
Careful!

575
01:08:57,278 --> 01:08:59,109
Just the way I left you.

576
01:09:04,786 --> 01:09:05,844
Good grief!

577
01:09:07,655 --> 01:09:11,591
I'm sorry, but I think
your contractor's doing a lousy job.

578
01:09:12,827 --> 01:09:14,488
These things happen.

579
01:09:23,771 --> 01:09:25,261
Thank God.

580
01:09:30,678 --> 01:09:32,009
Hang on, Mrs. O'Malley.

581
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,908
O'Malley left there
3 hours ago with the tape.

582
01:09:35,349 --> 01:09:37,112
It doesn't matter
about the tape.

583
01:09:37,318 --> 01:09:40,185
We have to get this film
to Dunphy's studio...

584
01:09:40,455 --> 01:09:42,685
...before I have a nervous breakdown.

585
01:09:43,024 --> 01:09:44,787
Mrs. O'Malley, listen.

586
01:09:45,193 --> 01:09:47,855
I'm across from the Bonaventure Hotel.

587
01:09:48,296 --> 01:09:50,526
I need you to do me a favor.

588
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:55,201
Have O'Malley deliver a message
to the desk under Andrea Smith.

589
01:09:55,470 --> 01:09:58,132
No, we're not checking in.
That's too dangerous.

590
01:09:58,372 --> 01:10:02,365
But the desk will hold the message
if you tell them we're coming in later.

591
01:10:02,643 --> 01:10:04,304
All right? Thanks.

592
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:07,541
Andrea...

593
01:10:08,816 --> 01:10:10,147
...Smith.

594
01:10:10,885 --> 01:10:13,217
Bonaventure Hotel...

595
01:10:14,989 --> 01:10:16,616
...and leave a message...

596
01:10:16,824 --> 01:10:17,813
...at the desk.

597
01:10:18,025 --> 01:10:20,858
Baby, that's beautiful.
I love it.

598
01:10:42,583 --> 01:10:44,574
Where's my glove, Uncle 'Mal?

599
01:10:45,386 --> 01:10:48,355
Take it easy.
Sonny, hurry up, dear.

600
01:10:48,589 --> 01:10:50,921
Sonny, forget the mitt.
We got to get going.

601
01:10:51,259 --> 01:10:54,092
The number for the
Bonaventure Hotel, please.

602
01:10:57,932 --> 01:11:02,767
Sonny, when this is over, you, me
and your pop will rent a fishing boat...

603
01:11:03,037 --> 01:11:07,303
...catch the biggest fish in the seas.
And I'm not talking goldfish either.

604
01:11:07,708 --> 01:11:09,903
The last time I went fishing with pop...

605
01:11:10,878 --> 01:11:12,675
...we caught an old tire.

606
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:16,372
Not this time, Sonny.
We're going to get us a big, fat tuna.

607
01:11:17,718 --> 01:11:19,447
- It's them.
- Let's go.

608
01:11:42,376 --> 01:11:43,707
Captain Hulland, L.A.P.D.

609
01:11:44,111 --> 01:11:48,775
I need to check any messages
for an Andrea Smith.

610
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:37,090
I wonder, do you have any messages
for an Andrea Smith, please?

611
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:01,017
Don't worry, Sonny's okay.

612
01:13:01,222 --> 01:13:05,352
He's with O'Malley, who has the tape,
and they're headed for Union Station.

613
01:13:05,559 --> 01:13:08,551
Great. Let's go get the car.
Just a minute.

614
01:13:30,952 --> 01:13:31,976
Cover me.

615
01:13:32,186 --> 01:13:33,710
Don't move.
You're surrounded.

616
01:13:48,369 --> 01:13:49,893
Come on.
Send for back-up!

617
01:13:54,442 --> 01:13:57,104
What's going on?
You can't do that in Dallas!

618
01:13:57,945 --> 01:13:59,435
That's a rented car!

619
01:14:03,351 --> 01:14:04,784
Get the goddamn car.

620
01:14:05,052 --> 01:14:06,383
Get the car!

621
01:14:50,331 --> 01:14:54,324
Your train is the Southwest Chief.
It departs for Albuquerque at 11:10.

622
01:14:54,668 --> 01:14:56,465
- Thank you.
- Have a safe trip.

623
01:15:08,949 --> 01:15:10,746
My hands are shaking.

624
01:15:11,118 --> 01:15:12,483
Don't worry, kid.

625
01:15:13,621 --> 01:15:17,022
Even your old Uncle Mally's paws
wobble a bit from time to time.

626
01:15:17,958 --> 01:15:18,947
Put this on.

627
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:22,323
And watch out for the hot dog.
Don't spill that mustard.

628
01:15:30,471 --> 01:15:33,929
I know it's hard to put together
after all these years.

629
01:15:34,875 --> 01:15:38,641
I'm sorry I had to tell you your dad
was dead. I thought it was best.

630
01:15:39,814 --> 01:15:41,304
I know it's awkward.

631
01:15:42,483 --> 01:15:44,644
But your father loves you very much.

632
01:15:45,653 --> 01:15:49,248
You've got to get to know each
other again. It'll take a little time.

633
01:15:49,457 --> 01:15:50,481
Now listen up.

634
01:15:52,093 --> 01:15:56,655
If your dad gets here on schedule, you
both get on the train. If he doesn't...

635
01:15:56,997 --> 01:16:01,331
...you'll be going alone. One of us
will be one step behind. Don't worry.

636
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:08,035
One step behind.

637
01:16:08,275 --> 01:16:11,608
Just like we planned it in the car
on the way down here.

638
01:16:14,215 --> 01:16:16,843
O'Malley, long time no see.

639
01:16:17,985 --> 01:16:20,180
Sonny, make sure
your father gets this.

640
01:16:25,826 --> 01:16:27,623
What are you doing?
Taking a trip?

641
01:16:28,229 --> 01:16:29,218
Yeah.

642
01:16:29,930 --> 01:16:32,558
Me and my kid are visiting
my mother in New Mexico.

643
01:16:34,001 --> 01:16:35,195
That's your son?

644
01:16:36,337 --> 01:16:38,737
That's funny.
He doesn't look much like you.

645
01:16:39,507 --> 01:16:40,997
Does he, Quintero?

646
01:16:42,076 --> 01:16:43,737
As a matter of fact...

647
01:16:44,178 --> 01:16:46,669
...I think I've seen
his ugly face before.

648
01:16:47,248 --> 01:16:49,011
Kind of looks like Mason Storm.

649
01:16:54,088 --> 01:16:57,922
Enough of this fucking around.
We want the tape.

650
01:16:58,325 --> 01:16:59,383
Run, Sonny!

651
01:17:08,335 --> 01:17:09,802
Run, Sonny!

652
01:17:34,128 --> 01:17:36,426
Take him.
We're going after the kid.

653
01:17:39,066 --> 01:17:40,863
I love you, Sonny.

654
01:17:42,536 --> 01:17:45,266
You fucks don't deserve
to wear your badges.

655
01:17:52,213 --> 01:17:54,238
Come here,
you little son-of-a-bitch!

656
01:17:56,083 --> 01:17:58,278
- The kid's got the tape.
- Get his ass!

657
01:18:11,832 --> 01:18:13,390
He's going in the alley!

658
01:18:18,372 --> 01:18:19,999
I'm going to call the police!

659
01:18:20,674 --> 01:18:22,164
Get out of the way!

660
01:18:25,613 --> 01:18:27,240
Help! Help!

661
01:18:27,448 --> 01:18:29,313
This guy's crazy.
He broke my gate!

662
01:18:30,951 --> 01:18:32,248
Stop!

663
01:18:32,686 --> 01:18:33,653
Please stop!

664
01:18:48,936 --> 01:18:50,631
My hand's bleeding bad.

665
01:19:10,057 --> 01:19:12,048
Stop!
You little bastard!

666
01:19:26,006 --> 01:19:28,338
Come on, don't mess with me.

667
01:19:28,909 --> 01:19:29,967
You fuck!

668
01:19:30,177 --> 01:19:31,041
My leg!

669
01:19:33,981 --> 01:19:35,846
Come here or l'll kill you!

670
01:19:43,524 --> 01:19:45,151
I broke my fucking leg!

671
01:20:06,847 --> 01:20:08,610
Coma Cop,
let's see what you got.

672
01:21:05,172 --> 01:21:06,639
You're still a loser.

673
01:21:09,343 --> 01:21:10,901
I remember you.

674
01:22:00,093 --> 01:22:01,219
Take care of him.

675
01:22:01,428 --> 01:22:04,158
- Where are you going?
- One more take-out order.

676
01:22:04,398 --> 01:22:07,128
- You'll be safe with her.
- You're okay with me.

677
01:22:19,847 --> 01:22:21,075
Who are you?

678
01:22:21,748 --> 01:22:23,943
It's a very long story.

679
01:22:24,251 --> 01:22:25,775
You got a few minutes?

680
01:23:05,859 --> 01:23:06,791
Senator.

681
01:23:10,063 --> 01:23:13,362
I know it's a bad time,
but a few things have happened...

682
01:23:13,567 --> 01:23:16,035
I want Quintero and the others here now.

683
01:23:16,803 --> 01:23:19,101
Storm is just nuts enough
to come after me.

684
01:23:19,306 --> 01:23:21,297
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

685
01:23:21,742 --> 01:23:24,472
Can we have
just a little privacy, please?

686
01:23:25,812 --> 01:23:27,211
l'll be downstairs.

687
01:23:30,484 --> 01:23:33,920
We're not going to make
the ballet tonight. Take a hike.

688
01:23:34,588 --> 01:23:35,850
Get lost!

689
01:24:19,132 --> 01:24:20,895
l'll show you guys how to break.

690
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:38,142
How's the action, boys?

691
01:24:38,652 --> 01:24:39,983
Mind if I play?

692
01:24:43,156 --> 01:24:47,490
I know what you're thinking.
If I have this is my hand, I can't play.

693
01:24:48,161 --> 01:24:50,891
How's this?
l'll put it away.

694
01:24:58,438 --> 01:25:00,770
Well?
Somebody hand me a cue.

695
01:25:22,929 --> 01:25:23,759
Impressive.

696
01:25:31,705 --> 01:25:33,730
That's for my wife.
Fuck you and die!

697
01:26:39,005 --> 01:26:40,063
Son-of-a-bitch!

698
01:26:55,288 --> 01:26:57,950
How does it feel to know
you're about to die?

699
01:27:02,529 --> 01:27:06,863
I'm going to give you more time
than you gave my wife and son.

700
01:27:28,688 --> 01:27:30,280
I got to tell you something!

701
01:27:30,490 --> 01:27:32,720
You can't do this!
It wasn't me!

702
01:27:33,059 --> 01:27:34,390
It wasn't me!

703
01:27:42,335 --> 01:27:43,893
Now you're a good cop.

704
01:27:55,382 --> 01:27:56,610
Vernon?

705
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,181
Let's try in here.

706
01:28:17,270 --> 01:28:19,534
Maybe you're behind this painting.

707
01:28:21,141 --> 01:28:23,405
No. You're so good
at this, Vernon.

708
01:28:24,778 --> 01:28:26,871
Maybe you're under the bed.

709
01:28:28,548 --> 01:28:31,073
No, not under the bed.

710
01:28:35,922 --> 01:28:37,446
What about in here?

711
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:49,325
Vernon, where are you?

712
01:29:25,605 --> 01:29:27,368
How do you like this, Vernon?

713
01:29:27,941 --> 01:29:31,377
I'd like to kill you so bad,
I can barely contain myself.

714
01:29:31,678 --> 01:29:33,111
But I've been thinking.

715
01:29:33,380 --> 01:29:36,349
Death is far too
merciful a fate for you.

716
01:29:36,683 --> 01:29:38,651
So what I'm going to do is...

717
01:29:40,287 --> 01:29:41,948
...put you in prison.

718
01:29:42,188 --> 01:29:46,181
A nice petite white boy like you
in a federal penitentiary...

719
01:29:46,459 --> 01:29:51,123
Let me put it this way. You won't be
able to stay anal retentive very long.

720
01:29:52,299 --> 01:29:54,529
I'm going to take
these handcuffs here...

721
01:29:55,135 --> 01:29:59,128
...then I'm going to arrest you,
and l'll take you in. How's that?

722
01:30:19,059 --> 01:30:20,185
What are you doing?

723
01:30:20,827 --> 01:30:22,351
Please. No!

724
01:30:31,004 --> 01:30:32,096
I missed.

725
01:30:33,740 --> 01:30:35,230
I never miss.

726
01:30:36,076 --> 01:30:38,510
They must have been smaller
than I thought.

727
01:30:41,581 --> 01:30:42,479
Freeze!

728
01:30:42,916 --> 01:30:44,713
Drop the gun!
Slowly!

729
01:30:45,685 --> 01:30:48,210
Get on your knees,
with your hands in the air.

730
01:30:48,421 --> 01:30:50,582
Thank God.
Thank God you guys are here.

731
01:30:51,024 --> 01:30:52,082
Do it now!

732
01:30:55,295 --> 01:30:56,762
You got to stop him.

733
01:31:01,768 --> 01:31:03,736
Let me go!
Storm, no!

734
01:31:08,375 --> 01:31:10,468
Storm, no!
Hold it right there.

735
01:31:11,378 --> 01:31:14,347
Please, sergeant, talk to him.
Tell him to let me go.

736
01:31:19,452 --> 01:31:21,113
Give me the gun.

737
01:31:25,792 --> 01:31:27,191
Give me the gun.

738
01:31:34,467 --> 01:31:35,866
We saw the film.

739
01:31:36,970 --> 01:31:38,835
We know you were set up.

740
01:31:39,973 --> 01:31:41,838
Senator, you're under arrest.

741
01:31:43,576 --> 01:31:44,634
Cuff him.

742
01:31:46,980 --> 01:31:48,948
What the hell are you talking about?

743
01:31:49,482 --> 01:31:52,451
What are you talking about?
You can't do this to me!

744
01:31:53,153 --> 01:31:56,645
I'm a Senator, for Christ's sake!
You can't do this to me!

745
01:32:02,796 --> 01:32:04,320
We're sorry, Storm.

746
01:32:07,167 --> 01:32:08,794
You're a dead man, Storm!

747
01:32:15,008 --> 01:32:17,272
- Are you all right?
- I love you, Storm.

748
01:32:19,345 --> 01:32:20,903
I'm the Senator!

749
01:32:21,347 --> 01:32:23,372
How about a nice vacation?

750
01:32:33,793 --> 01:32:35,852
This guy is going to be famous.

751
01:32:36,129 --> 01:32:39,860
I can hear tomorrow's weather report.
"Killer Storm strikes back."

752
01:32:40,066 --> 01:32:44,127
It shows Senator Trent making a deal
with his underworld cronies.

753
01:32:44,370 --> 01:32:47,362
You're going to be
very well compensated, Mr. Calabrese.

754
01:32:47,807 --> 01:32:50,537
Money now, and a lot more
when I get in that office.

755
01:32:50,743 --> 01:32:52,540
You can take that to the bank.

756
01:32:56,483 --> 01:32:59,145
We have the greatest respect
for Storm's courage.

757
01:32:59,619 --> 01:33:03,555
You told me this dock was clean.
What the hell's going on here?

758
01:33:03,756 --> 01:33:06,384
Are you people listening to me?
