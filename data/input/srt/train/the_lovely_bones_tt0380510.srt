1
00:01:20,961 --> 00:01:23,725
<i>l remember being really small,</i>

2
00:01:27,701 --> 00:01:30,499
<i>too small</i>
<i>to see over the edge of a table.</i>

3
00:01:33,073 --> 00:01:34,973
<i>There was a snow globe,</i>

4
00:01:36,576 --> 00:01:40,012
<i>and l remember the penguin</i>
<i>who lived inside the globe.</i>

5
00:01:44,484 --> 00:01:48,284
<i>He was all alone in there,</i>
<i>and l worried for him.</i>

6
00:01:56,396 --> 00:01:59,627
Don't worry, kiddo. He has a nice life.

7
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:02,799
He's trapped in a perfect world.

8
00:02:13,046 --> 00:02:14,911
Look at that, Susie Q.

9
00:02:15,615 --> 00:02:17,014
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

10
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,764
<i>l remember being given a camera</i>
<i>for my birthday.</i>

11
00:03:18,378 --> 00:03:23,213
<i>l loved the way a photo could capture</i>
<i>a moment before it was gone.</i>

12
00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:29,914
<i>That's what l wanted to be</i>
<i>when l grew up,</i>

13
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,958
<i>a wildlife photographer.</i>

14
00:03:34,861 --> 00:03:35,953
Sorry, Mom!

15
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:37,860
<i>l imagined that when l was older,</i>

16
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:41,662
<i>l'd be tracking wild elephants</i>
<i>and rhinos,</i>

17
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:45,034
<i>but for now,</i>
<i>l'd have to make do with Grace Tarking.</i>

18
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:04,680
<i>lt's strange, the memories you keep.</i>

19
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,323
<i>l remember going with Dad</i>
<i>to the sinkhole out at the Connors' farm.</i>

20
00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:21,971
<i>There was something about the way</i>
<i>the earth could swallow things whole,</i>

21
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:30,112
<i>and l remember the girl who lived there,</i>
<i>Ruth Connors.</i>

22
00:04:32,118 --> 00:04:34,916
<i>The kids at our school</i>
<i>said she was weird,</i>

23
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:39,190
<i>but now l know</i>
<i>she saw things others didn't.</i>

24
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:42,225
We're gonna kick it over on three, okay?
Are you ready?

25
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:44,991
-All right. One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

26
00:04:50,837 --> 00:04:54,705
<i>And l remember the worst thing</i>
<i>that ever happened to us as a family.</i>

27
00:04:54,774 --> 00:04:57,299
Help! Somebody help!

28
00:04:57,377 --> 00:04:58,708
-Mom?
-Help!

29
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,040
-Where are you? Mom?
-Buckley, please, get up!

30
00:05:03,116 --> 00:05:05,482
-Oh, God. Dad?
-Somebody help! Please!

31
00:05:05,552 --> 00:05:07,679
<i>The day my little brother</i>
<i>stopped breathing.</i>

32
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:09,415
Buckley!

33
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:11,650
Buckley! What happened?

34
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:13,488
He swallowed a twig!

35
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:30,673
Watch out!

36
00:05:31,578 --> 00:05:33,045
Are you crazy?

37
00:05:33,113 --> 00:05:34,273
Sorry!

38
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:09,510
Buckley?

39
00:06:17,724 --> 00:06:23,128
Are you okay? You're okay.
Oh, my baby. My baby.

40
00:06:23,196 --> 00:06:27,724
<i>And l remember</i>
<i>the light in my parents' eyes, the relief.</i>

41
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:29,666
lt was my fault. lt will not happen again.

42
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:31,761
<i>We weren't those people,</i>

43
00:06:31,838 --> 00:06:36,537
<i>those unlucky people to whom</i>
<i>bad things happen for no reason.</i>

44
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:48,052
You know, the Buddhists say
if you save someone else's life...

45
00:06:48,121 --> 00:06:51,579
<i>Grandma Lynn predicted</i>
<i>l would live a long and happy life</i>

46
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:53,956
<i>because l had saved my brother.</i>

47
00:06:54,794 --> 00:06:57,763
<i>As usual, Grandma Lynn was wrong.</i>

48
00:07:02,102 --> 00:07:05,367
<i>My name is Salmon, like the fish.</i>

49
00:07:05,438 --> 00:07:07,429
<i>First name, Susie.</i>

50
00:07:07,507 --> 00:07:10,499
<i>l was 1 4 years old</i>
<i>when l was murdered</i>

51
00:07:10,577 --> 00:07:13,478
<i>on December 6, 1973.</i>

52
00:07:13,546 --> 00:07:18,040
<i>And up next, we have Crystal</i>
<i>in a little, bitty, skinny mini!</i>

53
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,815
<i>This was before missing kids</i>
<i>started appearing on milk cartons</i>

54
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,688
<i>or were feature stories</i>
<i>on the daily news.</i>

55
00:07:27,994 --> 00:07:31,953
<i>lt was back when people believed</i>
<i>things like that didn't happen.</i>

56
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:37,431
<i>That's right, ladies.</i>
<i>No matter what the size,</i>

<i>-lf you got it, why not flaunt it?</i>
-Slow down, buddy!

59
00:07:43,343 --> 00:07:44,367
<i>-Am l right?</i>
-Buckley!

60
00:07:44,444 --> 00:07:46,309
Dad, look, look, look!

61
00:07:52,685 --> 00:07:55,210
There it is! Wow.

62
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:17,665
Who is he? Does he like you
as much as you like him?

63
00:08:17,744 --> 00:08:19,609
Grandma, he's a senior!

64
00:08:21,815 --> 00:08:23,544
He doesn't know l exist.

65
00:08:23,616 --> 00:08:24,981
He's cute.

66
00:08:25,051 --> 00:08:27,679
Grandma, can we please just drop it?

67
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:35,117
You're safe now.
He's gone into the record store.

68
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,357
<i>l wasn't safe.</i>

69
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,692
<i>A man in my neighborhood</i>
<i>was watching me.</i>

70
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:44,737
<i>lf l hadn't been so distracted,</i>

71
00:08:44,804 --> 00:08:47,238
<i>l would have realized</i>
<i>something was wrong,</i>

72
00:08:47,307 --> 00:08:50,367
<i>'cause that sort of thing</i>
<i>gives me the skeevies.</i>

73
00:08:50,977 --> 00:08:52,239
<i>But l was too busy</i>

74
00:08:52,312 --> 00:08:56,305
<i>thinking about the length</i>
<i>of Ray Singh's eyelashes.</i>

75
00:08:56,382 --> 00:08:59,613
<i>l had counted each one in library time</i>

76
00:08:59,686 --> 00:09:03,486
<i>while he was reading</i>
Abelard and Heloise,

77
00:09:03,556 --> 00:09:07,219
<i>the most seriously</i>
<i>tragic love story ever.</i>

78
00:09:09,262 --> 00:09:11,924
So, have you kissed him yet?

79
00:09:16,502 --> 00:09:20,029
Why not? You like him, he likes you.
What's the hold-up?

80
00:09:21,741 --> 00:09:24,733
l'm just afraid l won't be any good at it.

81
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:26,540
My first kiss

82
00:09:26,613 --> 00:09:28,410
was with a grown man.

83
00:09:31,618 --> 00:09:35,054
-You're not gonna tell on me, are you?
-Of course not!

84
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:38,754
-What was it like?
-The kiss?

85
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:42,090
Oh, it was wonderful.
Beautiful. Glorious.

86
00:09:42,762 --> 00:09:46,755
lt took me a long time
before l realized that a kiss like that,

87
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,630
it only happens once.

88
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:54,865
Suze...

89
00:09:57,143 --> 00:09:58,872
Just have fun, kid.

90
00:10:02,448 --> 00:10:04,712
<i>lt wasn't Mr. O'Dwyer, by the way.</i>

91
00:10:04,784 --> 00:10:07,582
<i>Although, he does look</i>
<i>kind of suspicious.</i>

92
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:10,989
<i>But Mr. O'Dwyer never hurt anyone.</i>

93
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:17,358
<i>Mr. O'Dwyer's own daughter</i>
<i>died a year and a half after l did.</i>

94
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,489
<i>She had leukemia,</i>

95
00:10:19,565 --> 00:10:21,726
<i>but l never saw her in my heaven.</i>

96
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,174
-Hey, look at me!
-We'll be right there, honey.

97
00:10:30,243 --> 00:10:31,232
-One second, okay?
-Mom!

98
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:32,642
Hi, honey.

99
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:36,007
<i>My murderer was a man</i>
<i>from our neighborhood.</i>

100
00:10:36,082 --> 00:10:37,913
-Thank you so much.
-Careful, honey.

101
00:10:37,984 --> 00:10:42,478
<i>l took his photo once as he talked</i>
<i>to my parents about his border flowers.</i>

102
00:10:44,724 --> 00:10:46,385
-Hey, Mom!
-You really should have a cup of coffee

103
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:47,983
with us sometime.

104
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:50,689
<i>l was aiming for the bushes</i>
<i>when he got in the way.</i>

105
00:10:50,763 --> 00:10:51,991
Thanks for the flower.

106
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:55,057
<i>He stepped out of nowhere</i>
<i>and ruined the shot.</i>

107
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,201
<i>He ruined a lot of things.</i>

108
00:10:59,272 --> 00:11:01,797
What have you
been photographing, honey?

109
00:11:01,874 --> 00:11:03,865
-Everything.
-Everything?

110
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:20,951
<i>Hey, look at me!</i>

111
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:29,225
<i>Mom!</i>

112
00:11:37,043 --> 00:11:38,203
<i>Smile!</i>

113
00:11:41,214 --> 00:11:42,943
<i>Mom!</i>

114
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,881
<i>Over here!</i>

115
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:50,279
<i>Hey, look at me!</i>

116
00:11:50,723 --> 00:11:51,951
<i>Hey, Mom!</i>

117
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,852
<i>Hey, over here! Look!</i>

118
00:12:41,207 --> 00:12:42,834
Okay, here we go.

119
00:13:26,853 --> 00:13:28,878
Clarissa has got a crush on you.

120
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:31,719
Which one's Clarissa?

121
00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:36,521
You know,
blond hair, megablue eye shadow.

122
00:13:36,596 --> 00:13:38,530
Her dad owns Surf 'n' Turf.

123
00:13:38,998 --> 00:13:40,625
The tall one?

124
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,358
She's not tall. She wears platforms.

125
00:13:44,804 --> 00:13:46,431
She doesn't know you're an accountant.

126
00:13:46,506 --> 00:13:48,030
l take it that's a negative.

127
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:50,769
Or that you're a closet scale modeler.

128
00:13:52,645 --> 00:13:55,170
Did Mom know before she married you?

129
00:13:56,082 --> 00:13:57,913
About your obsession?

130
00:13:58,217 --> 00:14:01,709
Susie, hobbies are healthy.
They teach you things.

131
00:14:02,288 --> 00:14:03,619
Like what?

132
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:07,553
Like if you start something, you finish it.

133
00:14:07,627 --> 00:14:09,026
You don't stop until you get it right.

134
00:14:09,095 --> 00:14:11,427
And if you don't get it right,
you start over again

135
00:14:11,497 --> 00:14:13,795
and you keep on going
as long as you have to.

136
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:17,825
That's the way it is.
That's what you do. lt's perfectly normal.

137
00:14:18,871 --> 00:14:21,738
You know, Grampy taught me to do this,
and now l'm teaching you.

138
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:25,243
We're creating something here,
for us, something special.

139
00:14:25,311 --> 00:14:26,505
l know.

140
00:14:27,246 --> 00:14:29,476
You're my first mate, Susie Q.

141
00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:32,209
One day, all of this will be yours.

142
00:14:32,285 --> 00:14:34,845
Jack! Susie! Dinner!

143
00:14:34,921 --> 00:14:36,411
Wait, wait, wait!

144
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:38,049
Ready?

145
00:14:39,225 --> 00:14:41,352
-Yeah.
-Now, hold her steady.

146
00:14:42,995 --> 00:14:45,156
Okay, shipmate, take it away!

147
00:14:52,838 --> 00:14:55,068
Now that is a thing of beauty.

148
00:14:59,111 --> 00:15:00,339
Come on.

149
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:28,270
l don't believe this! Would you look
at the state of this room?

150
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:32,770
You're gonna clean
this mess up tonight.

151
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:36,303
Yeah, l will. Hey, Mom,
we need to get these developed.

152
00:15:40,987 --> 00:15:43,217
Susie, you used up all the film?

153
00:15:43,856 --> 00:15:46,950
Do you have any idea
what this is going to cost?

154
00:15:49,462 --> 00:15:53,660
No. No, absolutely not.
Out of the question.

155
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:57,499
Thanks a lot.
That's my career down the toilet.

156
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,198
-Do not be so melodramatic.
-Honey, what? What's down the toilet?

157
00:16:00,273 --> 00:16:03,071
She's used up all the film
we gave her for her birthday.

158
00:16:03,142 --> 00:16:05,167
-All of it?
-All of it. Every single one.

159
00:16:05,244 --> 00:16:08,509
-Susie!
-lt's a crime to be creative in this family.

160
00:16:08,581 --> 00:16:12,312
All right, all right.
Well, say we pay for one roll a month?

161
00:16:14,153 --> 00:16:15,780
One roll a month?

162
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:21,150
You realize by the time l see my photos,
l'm gonna be middle-aged.

163
00:16:22,228 --> 00:16:25,197
Look, we got her 24 rolls of film, right?

164
00:16:25,264 --> 00:16:29,496
At $2.99 apiece to develop,
that's $7 1 .76.

165
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:32,560
-l don't think we're being unfair.
-Oh, honey.

166
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:34,733
Are we?

167
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:36,468
That's why l love you.

168
00:16:36,842 --> 00:16:38,036
Please.

169
00:16:38,678 --> 00:16:40,908
Could you just not do that at breakfast?

170
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,107
Yes, okay, whatever you say.

171
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,308
Eat your food. Come on.

172
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:49,411
lt doesn't have a siren, you moron.
lt's a cement mixer.

173
00:16:49,488 --> 00:16:52,184
Please don't call your brother a moron.

174
00:16:53,025 --> 00:16:56,188
Buddy. No, no, buddy.
Cement stays in the bowl. Please.

175
00:16:56,262 --> 00:16:58,594
lt's not cement. lt's my oaties!

176
00:16:58,664 --> 00:17:01,189
-Okay.
-School. Let's go.

177
00:17:01,267 --> 00:17:03,030
-Bye, Dad!
-Bye, Susie!

178
00:17:03,102 --> 00:17:04,262
Susie.

179
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,075
What's that?

180
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:15,340
That's your new hat, sweetie.

181
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,211
Wow, Mom,
l thought you'd given up knitting.

182
00:17:20,286 --> 00:17:23,847
No, l'm still knitting.
You want me to make you one, too?

183
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:28,954
-Do you have your gloves with you?
-Yes!

184
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:30,996
Could you put them on, please,
young lady?

185
00:17:31,063 --> 00:17:34,396
Susie! Susie, put your hat on! lt's cold.

186
00:17:35,735 --> 00:17:39,296
Holiday, inside!
Holiday, come here! Come here, boy.

187
00:17:40,506 --> 00:17:42,235
Cool-a-roonie, Suze!

188
00:17:42,308 --> 00:17:45,209
-Shut up.
-No, really, it looks good on you.

189
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:49,270
This is an exercise in humiliation.

190
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,320
-ls she looking?
-Maybe.

191
00:18:03,129 --> 00:18:04,528
Yes, l am.

192
00:18:05,264 --> 00:18:06,822
Hey, come on. We're late.

193
00:18:13,305 --> 00:18:15,569
Next week, bring your homework!

194
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:18,906
<i>Othello.</i> What is that?
lt sounds like a mint.

195
00:18:18,978 --> 00:18:21,742
That guy looked pretty stupid
with black makeup on.

196
00:18:21,814 --> 00:18:24,715
-Who?
-The one with two first names.

197
00:18:25,384 --> 00:18:27,875
-Lawrence Oliver.
-What a loser!

198
00:18:27,953 --> 00:18:29,614
-l know.
-Clarissa.

199
00:18:30,656 --> 00:18:32,988
-Come on. Let's go.
-l'm talking to Susie.

200
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:35,686
Yeah, and l've been waiting for hours
for your jerk-off film club to finish.

201
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:36,989
l want to get out of this dump.

202
00:18:37,062 --> 00:18:39,462
lt's nice to see you, too, Brian.

203
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:42,394
You coming or not?

204
00:18:43,235 --> 00:18:44,600
Yeah. Yeah.

205
00:18:45,171 --> 00:18:46,695
l'll see you, Susie.

206
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:49,005
l heard there was...

207
00:18:55,448 --> 00:18:56,813
Hey, Susie.

208
00:19:05,691 --> 00:19:07,124
Hi, Ray.

209
00:19:07,193 --> 00:19:09,491
What did you think of <i>The Moor?</i>

210
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:11,254
Who?

211
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:14,129
<i>Othello.</i>

212
00:19:17,736 --> 00:19:19,567
Well... Well, l just...

213
00:19:20,139 --> 00:19:22,130
lt was amazing!

214
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:25,837
Yeah. l mean, it was really incredible!

215
00:19:28,848 --> 00:19:30,475
l love that play.

216
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:34,212
That's another thing
we have in common.

217
00:19:36,121 --> 00:19:38,419
What else do we have in common?

218
00:19:43,062 --> 00:19:44,586
Don't you know?

219
00:19:52,371 --> 00:19:53,463
Crap!

220
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,373
-lt's okay.
-lt's fine. l've got it.

221
00:19:58,911 --> 00:20:01,846
Stupid books. l don't even read them. l...

222
00:20:01,914 --> 00:20:03,882
-Well, l do...
-Susie?

223
00:20:03,949 --> 00:20:06,042
What are you doing on Saturday?

224
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:23,794
Are you really from England?

225
00:20:26,171 --> 00:20:27,229
Yes.

226
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,782
You are beautiful, Susie Salmon.

227
00:20:53,332 --> 00:20:55,926
-Forget it.
-This is obscene!

228
00:20:56,001 --> 00:20:57,764
Are you listening to me?

229
00:20:57,836 --> 00:21:00,202
There are no breasts
on this anatomy model.

230
00:21:00,272 --> 00:21:03,105
There are no eyes or mouth either,
but we were told to draw in the face.

231
00:21:03,175 --> 00:21:06,508
Well, your unnecessary
anatomical additions

232
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:08,638
got the Ellis boy thoroughly overexcited.

233
00:21:08,714 --> 00:21:09,772
He stole my drawing.

234
00:21:09,848 --> 00:21:14,114
Yes, and now there are pictures
of naked women all over this school.

235
00:21:15,554 --> 00:21:17,283
Move along, people.

236
00:21:17,756 --> 00:21:20,919
-Sir, can l have my drawing back?
-Certainly not.

237
00:21:24,263 --> 00:21:26,754
Did you hear me, Singh? Go!

238
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,801
Meet me at the mall, 10:00, Saturday.

239
00:21:29,868 --> 00:21:31,165
Now!

240
00:21:31,236 --> 00:21:33,534
-Where in the mall?
-The gazebo.

241
00:22:20,219 --> 00:22:22,449
<i>lt's for an Air Force base?</i>

242
00:22:22,521 --> 00:22:24,716
-Hello?
-Dad!

243
00:22:25,924 --> 00:22:27,824
Hey, buddy. No, no, no!

244
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:30,788
God, you're choking me.
l need some air!

245
00:22:42,107 --> 00:22:44,098
-How was your day?
-Good. Buckley, go wash your hands.

246
00:22:44,176 --> 00:22:45,200
Go ahead, buddy.
We'll play after dinner.

247
00:22:45,277 --> 00:22:46,335
ls Susie with you?

248
00:22:46,412 --> 00:22:47,879
-No.
-She's late.

249
00:22:49,381 --> 00:22:52,009
-Lindsey Lou, where's your sister?
-What?

250
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:54,609
-Your sister.
-Oh, she had film club.

251
00:22:56,221 --> 00:22:57,245
What's for dinner, hon?

252
00:23:30,522 --> 00:23:32,114
Oh, shoot!

253
00:23:34,827 --> 00:23:37,057
l hope that was your homework.

254
00:23:39,164 --> 00:23:41,394
Oh, hey, you're the Salmon girl, right?

255
00:23:42,234 --> 00:23:43,258
Yeah.

256
00:23:43,335 --> 00:23:45,360
Remember me? You remember me.

257
00:23:45,437 --> 00:23:48,736
l live right down the street,
down in the green house.

258
00:23:48,807 --> 00:23:50,138
Mr. Harvey.

259
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:52,734
-Hi.
-Hi. How are you?

260
00:23:52,811 --> 00:23:56,110
-How are your folks doing?
-They're fine.

261
00:23:56,582 --> 00:23:58,914
Good. Tell them l said hi.

262
00:23:58,984 --> 00:24:01,282
You know, you're the perfect person
for me to run into,

263
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:04,083
because l just built this thing over here
and l want to get a second opinion.

264
00:24:04,156 --> 00:24:06,147
Do you mind taking a look?

265
00:24:07,226 --> 00:24:10,320
Well, actually, Mr. Harvey,
l have to get home.

266
00:24:12,331 --> 00:24:13,423
Okay.

267
00:24:19,004 --> 00:24:20,665
l just worked so hard on it

268
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:23,299
and l guess l got excited
for someone to see it.

269
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:25,002
But that's okay.

270
00:24:25,077 --> 00:24:26,339
l'll show the other kids
in the neighborhood.

271
00:24:26,411 --> 00:24:28,641
They're gonna be very excited about it.

272
00:24:31,016 --> 00:24:32,210
Really?

273
00:24:33,018 --> 00:24:36,078
Oh, yeah. lt's great.
l mean, it's really neat.

274
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,192
Come on. lt'll take two minutes.

275
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:50,762
You're probably late already.

276
00:25:00,312 --> 00:25:01,904
l don't see anything.

277
00:25:02,548 --> 00:25:03,879
You don't?

278
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:07,909
You're gonna have to be
more observant, Susie.

279
00:25:33,011 --> 00:25:34,342
What is it?

280
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,046
-l washed my hands!
-Give me five.

281
00:25:37,115 --> 00:25:39,948
Hey, hey, hey, you gotta dry them.
All right.

282
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,050
-Thanks, Mom.
-l'm missing a fork.

283
00:25:44,122 --> 00:25:46,716
-Oh, not beans!
-What?

284
00:25:46,792 --> 00:25:48,817
-Only one.
-One bean?

285
00:25:55,267 --> 00:25:56,894
Pretty neat, huh?

286
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,237
You want a...
You want a pork chop, honey?

287
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:03,274
-Yes. Thank you.
-Hot, hot!

288
00:26:03,342 --> 00:26:06,539
See? Look at your sister,
great eating habits.

289
00:26:06,612 --> 00:26:08,477
Yeah, but she's older!

290
00:26:09,715 --> 00:26:11,512
-There you go.
-Got it?

291
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:12,641
Okay.

292
00:26:13,218 --> 00:26:14,810
l built it for the kids in the neighborhood.

293
00:26:14,887 --> 00:26:18,948
l thought they could use it
as kind of a clubhouse, or...

294
00:26:19,024 --> 00:26:20,491
l don't know.

295
00:26:21,393 --> 00:26:24,294
You want to be the first one to try it out?

296
00:26:26,131 --> 00:26:28,793
-Really?
-Yeah, sure, yeah! Go ahead.

297
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:31,028
lt'll be fun. Go ahead.

298
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:33,736
The corn got into my beans.

299
00:26:33,805 --> 00:26:36,205
lf you eat them both,
you can stay up and watch TV with me.

300
00:26:36,275 --> 00:26:37,606
Nah.

301
00:26:38,277 --> 00:26:39,972
l'll make her a plate.

302
00:26:41,146 --> 00:26:43,307
That's it. That's it.

303
00:26:50,856 --> 00:26:51,914
Wow!

304
00:27:01,233 --> 00:27:02,962
Wow, this is neato.

305
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:11,273
She doesn't like beans,
so l'm not gonna give her any.

306
00:27:11,343 --> 00:27:14,210
Put more. Put more on her plate.
l'm gonna make her eat them all.

307
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:17,305
-Why doesn't she get to eat beans?
-Okay, okay, l'm gonna give her beans.

308
00:27:17,382 --> 00:27:19,282
-They're really good.
-Watch this.

309
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:21,182
-That's better.
-Pile them on.

310
00:27:21,253 --> 00:27:23,813
You think Popeye only eats spinach?
There's beans in that can, too.

311
00:27:30,529 --> 00:27:32,394
Make yourself at home.

312
00:27:35,634 --> 00:27:38,364
-This is really cool, Mr. Harvey.
-Yeah, this is cool, huh?

313
00:27:38,437 --> 00:27:40,667
Yeah. l thought that you kids
would like a place of your own

314
00:27:40,739 --> 00:27:42,639
to, you know, hang out.

315
00:27:45,444 --> 00:27:48,709
Here. Have a seat. Go ahead.
There you go.

316
00:27:49,481 --> 00:27:51,711
Sit. You like it?

317
00:27:51,783 --> 00:27:53,182
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

318
00:27:59,658 --> 00:28:01,683
You think she's still at the mall?

319
00:28:02,361 --> 00:28:03,726
-Yeah.
-Really?

320
00:28:03,795 --> 00:28:04,955
She'll be with Clarissa.

321
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,554
She could have at least called.

322
00:28:06,631 --> 00:28:08,223
l mean, a 1 4-year-old girl knows
how to use a telephone.

323
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,358
Can l please...

324
00:28:09,434 --> 00:28:12,961
l understand. l understand.
l'll deal with her when she gets home.

325
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:15,404
See, l got all these little things,
like this little...

326
00:28:15,474 --> 00:28:19,706
Little, you know, fluffy animals
and some games,

327
00:28:19,778 --> 00:28:21,302
'cause l know you kids
like to play games.

328
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,847
And then, you know, candles

329
00:28:22,914 --> 00:28:25,576
and, you know, little figurines
like these angels,

330
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,140
l thought were so pretty.

331
00:28:27,219 --> 00:28:29,380
All the figurines have little...

332
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:36,988
Very sweet. And, you know,
some of these little things.

333
00:28:38,463 --> 00:28:39,930
There you go!

334
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,734
lt's nice, with the candles
and everything, right?

335
00:28:46,371 --> 00:28:48,202
And there's one rule.

336
00:28:48,974 --> 00:28:51,135
No adults allowed!

337
00:28:58,417 --> 00:28:59,543
Okay?

338
00:29:06,525 --> 00:29:09,460
That's a cute hat.
l like that hat very much.

339
00:29:15,567 --> 00:29:18,092
Would you like a refreshment, Susie?

340
00:29:23,241 --> 00:29:26,074
-Actually, l have to go.
-No. Be polite.

341
00:29:26,945 --> 00:29:28,810
You have to be polite.

342
00:29:29,514 --> 00:29:32,506
Be polite. That's another rule.

343
00:29:49,434 --> 00:29:51,095
lt's warm in here.

344
00:29:52,337 --> 00:29:54,202
l'm warm. Are you warm?

345
00:29:56,274 --> 00:29:58,970
You can take your coat off if you want.

346
00:30:13,725 --> 00:30:15,852
You look very pretty, Susie.

347
00:30:16,895 --> 00:30:18,089
Thanks.

348
00:30:22,434 --> 00:30:24,402
Do you have a boyfriend?

349
00:30:30,976 --> 00:30:34,742
No? l knew it. See, l knew
you weren't like those other girls.

350
00:30:34,813 --> 00:30:36,610
l knew that.

351
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:38,046
Mr. Harvey?

352
00:30:38,984 --> 00:30:43,114
lt's nice down here, isn't it? lt's special.
lt's special down here, right?

353
00:30:43,188 --> 00:30:47,056
Yes. lt is. lt's very special.

354
00:30:59,171 --> 00:31:00,661
l have to go.

355
00:31:02,107 --> 00:31:04,132
l don't want you to leave.

356
00:31:07,846 --> 00:31:10,246
l'm not going to hurt you, Susie.

357
00:32:05,503 --> 00:32:08,666
lf you see her,
would you please just call? Thank you.

358
00:32:09,574 --> 00:32:11,508
She's not with the Steads.

359
00:32:12,043 --> 00:32:13,704
Where are my keys?

360
00:32:15,347 --> 00:32:16,974
-Where are they?
-l don't know, honey.

361
00:32:17,048 --> 00:32:19,346
ln the bowl by the door?
Where are you going?

362
00:32:19,417 --> 00:32:21,885
Jack, could you just wait?

363
00:32:21,953 --> 00:32:24,421
Jack, would you please wait
for the police?

364
00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:26,457
Look, stay by the phone.

365
00:32:33,865 --> 00:32:36,698
Man, she is going to be
in so much trouble.

366
00:32:40,405 --> 00:32:43,033
-Go back to bed, sweetie.
-Okay.

367
00:32:47,045 --> 00:32:49,036
Guys, this is my little girl, Susie.

368
00:32:49,114 --> 00:32:51,048
She hasn't come home from school.
Have you seen her?

369
00:32:51,116 --> 00:32:52,310
-No, l ain't seen nobody.
-No?

370
00:32:52,384 --> 00:32:54,045
-Sorry.
-Ma'am, could you take a look at this?

371
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:56,587
Have you seen this little girl?

372
00:32:56,655 --> 00:32:58,122
Sorry, buddy.

373
00:32:59,257 --> 00:33:02,124
Can you take a look at this, please?
lt's my little girl. She hasn't come home.

374
00:33:02,193 --> 00:33:04,559
-Sorry.
-Just take a look at that.

375
00:33:05,463 --> 00:33:07,897
Ma'am, have you seen this girl?
Please, can you just take a look?

376
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:25,209
Susan has been missing for, what is it,
four hours now?

377
00:33:25,283 --> 00:33:27,751
Susie. We call her Susie.

378
00:33:28,253 --> 00:33:30,983
Yeah, a little more than four hours.

379
00:33:31,589 --> 00:33:33,682
This the first time she's run away?

380
00:33:33,758 --> 00:33:36,750
She didn't run away.
She's... She's missing.

381
00:33:36,828 --> 00:33:38,625
Any problems at home?

382
00:33:40,965 --> 00:33:42,728
Family difficulties?

383
00:33:43,835 --> 00:33:46,429
No, there really are no problems.

384
00:33:46,504 --> 00:33:50,304
This is a happy... She's a happy child.

385
00:33:51,776 --> 00:33:54,074
-She's never done this, Detective. She...
-l understand that.

386
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:55,442
-l just have to get a sense of...
-She's not home,

387
00:33:55,513 --> 00:33:56,912
-and she always comes home.
-...what's going on here.

388
00:33:56,981 --> 00:33:57,970
There's nothing going on.

389
00:33:58,049 --> 00:33:59,038
-She's missing.
-Understood.

390
00:34:00,685 --> 00:34:02,915
-lf you see her, please call me, okay?
-Sure thing, Jack.

391
00:34:02,987 --> 00:34:04,454
l'll come back
and see you guys in a little while.

392
00:34:04,522 --> 00:34:06,046
All right. Take care.

393
00:34:06,124 --> 00:34:07,148
Dad?

394
00:34:10,628 --> 00:34:12,721
Excuse me. l'm sorry to interrupt you.

395
00:34:12,797 --> 00:34:14,526
My name's Jack Salmon.
l live right around the corner.

396
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:15,657
Dad!

397
00:34:34,285 --> 00:34:35,343
Dad!

398
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:40,357
Can you put together a list
of all her friends

399
00:34:40,425 --> 00:34:42,825
-and their names, contact information...
-Sure.

400
00:34:42,894 --> 00:34:45,522
...and a description
of what she was wearing?

401
00:34:45,597 --> 00:34:47,656
Yes, of course. Well, actually,
l could tell you that right now

402
00:34:47,732 --> 00:34:50,360
if you want to write it down.
She was wearing

403
00:34:50,802 --> 00:34:52,360
a hand-knitted wool hat.

404
00:34:59,811 --> 00:35:01,574
Mom! Dad!

405
00:35:06,484 --> 00:35:08,145
<i>And it has</i>

406
00:35:08,987 --> 00:35:10,978
<i>long, thin tassels.</i>

407
00:35:14,626 --> 00:35:17,117
<i>And she also has...</i>

408
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,891
<i>Well, in fact,</i>
<i>today she didn't wear her scarf.</i>

409
00:35:21,566 --> 00:35:23,693
But she did wear pink gloves,

410
00:35:23,768 --> 00:35:28,933
and she has a beige canvas schoolbag,
and it's got...

411
00:35:29,007 --> 00:35:30,167
Mom?

412
00:35:30,241 --> 00:35:33,176
<i>...rock star buttons pinned to it.</i>

413
00:35:35,847 --> 00:35:39,146
<i>She has</i> Othello <i>inside her bag...</i>

414
00:37:48,313 --> 00:37:50,474
No!

415
00:37:53,885 --> 00:37:56,615
No!

416
00:38:07,999 --> 00:38:09,990
Secure that cordon.

417
00:38:10,068 --> 00:38:12,400
Jesus Christ.
And tape off the rest of the area

418
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:13,960
before the whole neighborhood
shows up.

419
00:38:15,173 --> 00:38:17,368
Set up the lCP at the school.

420
00:38:21,346 --> 00:38:22,813
What is that?

421
00:38:30,021 --> 00:38:33,650
We found some evidence
in the cornfield behind the school.

422
00:38:34,192 --> 00:38:37,389
There was a cavity in the earth
with a lot of debris,

423
00:38:37,462 --> 00:38:39,953
mostly loose woods and broken crates.

424
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:43,000
We think it's the remains
of some kind of structure.

425
00:38:43,067 --> 00:38:44,432
And Susie?

426
00:38:47,538 --> 00:38:49,870
We didn't find her, Mrs. Salmon.

427
00:38:50,975 --> 00:38:52,840
That's good, isn't it?

428
00:38:53,311 --> 00:38:55,302
l mean, you found Susie's hat,
but you didn't find her,

429
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,406
which means we really don't even know
if she was there at all. Right?

430
00:38:58,483 --> 00:39:01,941
l mean, that... That... l mean, it's...
lt's preferable, right?

431
00:39:12,997 --> 00:39:14,760
We also found blood.

432
00:39:18,836 --> 00:39:21,066
A significant amount of blood.

433
00:39:27,211 --> 00:39:28,735
l'm very sorry.

434
00:39:30,581 --> 00:39:33,015
Hey, we'll get through this.

435
00:39:33,084 --> 00:39:35,314
-How?
-l'm going to take care of you.

436
00:39:35,386 --> 00:39:37,047
-How?
-l'm going to take care of all of us.

437
00:39:37,121 --> 00:39:39,385
-You can't.
-l'll make it right.

438
00:39:39,924 --> 00:39:41,949
You can't make this right, Jack.

439
00:39:42,026 --> 00:39:43,755
-You can't.
-We're going to find her. l promise.

440
00:39:43,828 --> 00:39:45,625
We'll bring her home.

441
00:40:28,372 --> 00:40:30,306
lf you see anything
that's out of the ordinary

442
00:40:30,374 --> 00:40:33,241
or anybody that's out of the ordinary,
please don't hesitate to call us.

443
00:40:33,311 --> 00:40:35,211
-Certainly.
-You have my number.

444
00:40:35,279 --> 00:40:38,248
Or you just come by the police station.
Okay? l'll be there.

445
00:40:38,316 --> 00:40:40,181
-Thank you for your time.
-You're welcome.

446
00:40:40,251 --> 00:40:42,344
-Have a good day.
-You, too.

447
00:40:49,327 --> 00:40:50,988
What's that, a Wagoneer?

448
00:41:30,034 --> 00:41:31,695
-Mr. Harvey.
-Yes?

449
00:41:31,769 --> 00:41:33,794
Detective Len Fenerman.

450
00:41:33,871 --> 00:41:35,168
How do you do?

451
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:37,173
Do you have some time
for a few questions?

452
00:41:37,241 --> 00:41:39,402
-Certainly. Come in.
-Thanks.

453
00:41:40,578 --> 00:41:42,239
l know why you're here, of course.

454
00:41:42,313 --> 00:41:44,907
l think
when something like this happens,

455
00:41:44,982 --> 00:41:47,473
you always blame yourself.

456
00:41:47,552 --> 00:41:49,679
All l can think about now is

457
00:41:49,754 --> 00:41:52,552
why didn't l see something
or why didn't l hear something?

458
00:41:52,623 --> 00:41:55,285
Because... Because surely

459
00:41:56,561 --> 00:41:59,052
that young girl must have screamed.

460
00:42:01,933 --> 00:42:04,265
-Did you want...
-No, no, thanks. l'm fine.

461
00:42:04,335 --> 00:42:05,495
But if you could just think back.

462
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:08,835
l mean, she was wearing a blue jacket,
yellow corduroys.

463
00:42:08,906 --> 00:42:10,897
Similar clothes to these.

464
00:42:12,577 --> 00:42:15,444
-This blue jacket here?
-The darker blue jacket.

465
00:42:15,513 --> 00:42:17,572
And on the second photograph,
you could see the pants, as well.

466
00:42:17,648 --> 00:42:19,206
Oh, l see. Yeah.

467
00:42:19,951 --> 00:42:22,419
No, it does not ring a bell.

468
00:42:22,486 --> 00:42:24,852
But you were at home that day.

469
00:42:24,922 --> 00:42:26,947
-What day?
-Last Wednesday.

470
00:42:27,024 --> 00:42:28,651
Last Wednesday...

471
00:42:47,211 --> 00:42:50,237
Last Wednesday...
No, l was home all day.

472
00:42:50,815 --> 00:42:52,282
l mean, l probably went out

473
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:56,081
and ran a few errands
or something like that, but, l mean...

474
00:42:57,154 --> 00:43:00,453
l should have been here all day,
for the most part.

475
00:43:00,524 --> 00:43:02,219
Okay. Good.

476
00:43:02,293 --> 00:43:04,056
-All righty.
-Thanks.

477
00:43:05,329 --> 00:43:08,196
-You married?
-l was, yeah.

478
00:43:08,266 --> 00:43:10,029
But you have kids.

479
00:43:10,101 --> 00:43:12,968
No, l wish. l wish. But no.

480
00:43:13,871 --> 00:43:16,169
-You mind if l take a look?
-No.

481
00:43:19,343 --> 00:43:21,573
l make everything myself.

482
00:43:21,646 --> 00:43:22,772
-Really?
-Oh, yeah. All this.

483
00:43:22,847 --> 00:43:27,181
l turn all the banisters myself and make
all the shingles and the furniture.

484
00:43:27,251 --> 00:43:28,809
And l used to do cabinet making,

485
00:43:28,886 --> 00:43:30,979
but there's not much call
for that these days.

486
00:43:31,055 --> 00:43:32,716
Maybe l spend too much time
on these things,

487
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:35,759
but it's the perfectionist in me, l guess.

488
00:43:35,826 --> 00:43:37,760
-Well, it shows.
-Thank you.

489
00:43:37,828 --> 00:43:40,524
-That's amazing craftsmanship.
-Oh, well...

490
00:43:41,065 --> 00:43:43,898
l took a risk and tried something new
and discovered a talent

491
00:43:43,968 --> 00:43:45,959
that l didn't know l had.

492
00:43:56,814 --> 00:43:58,805
What's that underneath the stairs?

493
00:43:59,784 --> 00:44:01,877
That would be the basement.

494
00:44:10,361 --> 00:44:11,419
Dad?

495
00:44:14,265 --> 00:44:16,130
She's dead, isn't she?

496
00:44:32,717 --> 00:44:34,480
<i>l was slipping away.</i>

497
00:44:36,187 --> 00:44:38,178

00:44:40,257 --> 00:44:42,054
<i>Life was leaving me.</i>

499
00:44:47,732 --> 00:44:49,495
<i>But l wasn't afraid.</i>

500
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:55,499
<i>Then l remembered,</i>

501
00:44:57,241 --> 00:44:59,869
<i>there was something l was meant to do,</i>

502
00:45:01,645 --> 00:45:03,772
<i>somewhere l was meant to be.</i>

503
00:45:21,499 --> 00:45:22,557
Ray?

504
00:45:38,616 --> 00:45:39,674
Ray!

Are you the Moor?

Why?

515
00:50:10,054 --> 00:50:12,181
l think this belongs to you.

516

Where did you get this?

00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,331

Don't you have somewhere to go?

You miss her, don't you?

521
00:50:46,323 --> 00:50:48,518
l never knew what dead meant.

522
00:50:49,593 --> 00:50:53,085
l used to think it meant lost. Frozen.

523
00:50:54,098 --> 00:50:55,588
lt means gone.

524
00:50:57,101 --> 00:50:58,432
She's gone.

525
00:51:01,772 --> 00:51:03,433
What if she isn't?

526
00:51:07,444 --> 00:51:09,435
What if she's still here?

527
00:51:19,323 --> 00:51:22,224
-You're not supposed to do that.
-What?

528
00:51:23,861 --> 00:51:27,058
-Who are you?
-She saw you, that girl.

529
00:51:27,131 --> 00:51:29,224
l think my hand touched hers.

530
00:51:29,299 --> 00:51:31,028
Yes, that's all it takes.

You're not supposed to look back.
You're supposed to keep going.

533

Hey! Come back!

534
00:51:40,411 --> 00:51:42,675
Wait! Who are you?

00:51:42,746 --> 00:51:45,738
l'm Holly. Holly Golightly.

Up here? You mean in heaven.

-You're funny.
-What's funny about it?

540
00:51:58,762 --> 00:52:01,128
This isn't heaven. You're not there yet.

541

What is this place?

542
00:52:04,601 --> 00:52:09,038
This place is not really one place
and also is not the other place.

lt's bits of both!

-That's where we're going.

She came into my room.

And l understand why,

01:01:42,746 --> 01:01:46,079
Now, he appears to be perfectly normal,
but, Len,

627
01:01:46,149 --> 01:01:49,118
-the man wears adult diapers.
-Herman is 80 years old.

628
01:01:49,185 --> 01:01:52,643
l followed him in the supermarket.
His shopping cart was filled with them.

629
01:01:52,722 --> 01:01:54,656
-He has a prostate problem.
-My point is,

630
01:01:54,724 --> 01:01:56,555
we need to start working backwards.

631
01:01:56,626 --> 01:02:00,289
Start looking at family histories,
criminal records, mental health issues.

632
01:02:00,363 --> 01:02:01,557
l've been doing a lot of reading
on this subject.

633
01:02:01,631 --> 01:02:02,655
Jack, this doesn't change anything.

634
01:02:02,732 --> 01:02:06,429
Did l mention taxes? Len, you can tell
a lot about a person from taxes.

635
01:02:06,503 --> 01:02:09,404
Please, will you just stop it now?
Will you just stop?

636
01:02:09,472 --> 01:02:11,702
Can't you just leave it alone?

637
01:02:14,811 --> 01:02:17,405
Jack, l know it's been 1 1 months.

638
01:02:17,781 --> 01:02:21,080
l know you've been trying
to deal with this in your own way,

639
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:25,443
but she's not coping very well.
She needs help, Jack.

640
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:30,050
She needs someone
to help her get through this.

641
01:02:35,865 --> 01:02:39,232
Grandma's here!
Grandma! Grandma's here!

642
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:42,829
What's my mother doing here?

643
01:02:42,906 --> 01:02:44,498
Look, you're not coping, okay?

644
01:02:44,574 --> 01:02:47,236
Len's worried. l'm worried.
Your mother offered to help.

645
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:49,175
You invited her here?

646
01:02:49,245 --> 01:02:51,839
-Darling!
-Hello, Mother.

647
01:02:51,915 --> 01:02:53,439
-Watch the hair, sweetheart.
-Sorry.

648
01:02:53,516 --> 01:02:56,576
-Look at you. Are you eating?
-ls this all of it?

649
01:02:56,653 --> 01:02:59,019
Don't be ridiculous.
That's just my makeup.

650
01:02:59,089 --> 01:03:01,614
You are still handsome as hell, Jack.

651
01:03:02,092 --> 01:03:04,583
Lindsey, honey,
aren't you going to say hello?

652
01:03:04,661 --> 01:03:07,289
-The child hates me.
-Come here, buddy.

653
01:03:07,363 --> 01:03:09,695
So, what'll it be, Jack?

654
01:03:10,366 --> 01:03:12,334
Actually, l'm not drinking these days.

655
01:03:12,402 --> 01:03:14,302
Well, that's your problem in a nutshell.

656
01:03:16,873 --> 01:03:18,238
Are we still a family?

657
01:03:18,308 --> 01:03:19,900
Of course we're a family.

658
01:03:19,976 --> 01:03:22,536
Your mother's in crisis,
your father's a wreck.

659
01:03:22,612 --> 01:03:24,580
What does that make you?

660
01:03:26,683 --> 01:03:28,412
l'm in charge.

661
01:04:46,896 --> 01:04:49,160
...through the woods,
looking for fuzzwalker.

662
01:04:50,133 --> 01:04:54,502
Then he sees three. And he takes
his gun and looks and aims.

663
01:04:54,571 --> 01:04:56,368
And then, a giant puff of smoke!

664
01:04:56,439 --> 01:04:59,704
He doesn't see them anymore.
Then he realizes that was his gun.

665
01:04:59,776 --> 01:05:02,176
lt was out of bullets! Then he runs.

666
01:05:02,245 --> 01:05:04,372
Runs, runs, runs, runs, runs!

667
01:05:04,447 --> 01:05:05,709
Till he runs in the forest,

668
01:05:05,782 --> 01:05:09,411
but then he realizes
he came without his fuzzwalker.

669
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:28,498
Holiday!

670
01:05:40,049 --> 01:05:41,641
All right! Okay!

671
01:05:49,659 --> 01:05:51,786
You're a Salmon girl, right?

672
01:05:56,366 --> 01:05:57,458
Okay.

673
01:05:59,168 --> 01:06:00,260
Okay.

674
01:06:05,975 --> 01:06:07,203
Holiday.

675
01:06:16,552 --> 01:06:17,780
Grandma?

676
01:06:18,988 --> 01:06:20,853
l know where Susie is.

677
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:24,421
Yeah, Susie's gone
to heaven, sweetheart.

678
01:06:24,494 --> 01:06:26,985
Lindsey said there is no heaven.

679
01:06:27,063 --> 01:06:29,156
All right, then, she's dead.

680
01:06:30,967 --> 01:06:32,958
You might be dead soon.

681
01:06:33,036 --> 01:06:35,834
-Why do you say that?
-Because you're old.

682
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,439
Thirty-five is not old.

683
01:06:38,508 --> 01:06:41,568
You've been sniffing
too much of that nail polish.

684
01:06:41,644 --> 01:06:43,908
And, anyway,
nothing is going to happen to me.

685
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:45,447
You know why?

686
01:06:47,116 --> 01:06:50,210
Because l take my medicine every day.

687
01:06:52,622 --> 01:06:53,953
Grandma,

688
01:06:55,658 --> 01:06:57,489
she's here.

689
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,027
-What?
-Susie.

690
01:07:00,396 --> 01:07:02,387
Susie's in the in-between.

691
01:07:18,314 --> 01:07:22,114
<i>l was in the blue horizon,</i>
<i>between heaven and Earth.</i>

692
01:07:23,586 --> 01:07:25,577
<i>The days were unchanging,</i>

693
01:07:26,856 --> 01:07:30,690
<i>and every night,</i>
<i>l dreamed the same dream.</i>

694
01:07:33,196 --> 01:07:35,164
<i>The smell of damp earth.</i>

695
01:07:35,998 --> 01:07:38,193
<i>The scream that no one heard.</i>

696
01:07:40,002 --> 01:07:44,598
<i>The sound of my heart beating,</i>
<i>like a hammer against cloth.</i>

697
01:07:48,544 --> 01:07:50,774
<i>And l would hear them calling,</i>

698
01:07:51,714 --> 01:07:54,114
<i>the voices of the dead.</i>

699
01:07:57,086 --> 01:07:59,054
<i>l wanted to follow them,</i>

700
01:07:59,122 --> 01:08:00,783
<i>to find a way out,</i>

701
01:08:02,291 --> 01:08:05,624
<i>but l would always come back</i>
<i>to the same door.</i>

702
01:08:08,030 --> 01:08:09,657
<i>And l was afraid.</i>

703
01:08:13,336 --> 01:08:15,804
<i>l knew if l went in there,</i>

704
01:08:17,673 --> 01:08:19,573
<i>l would never come out.</i>

705
01:08:26,416 --> 01:08:29,943
<i>My murderer could live in one moment</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

706
01:08:31,354 --> 01:08:35,688
<i>He could feed off a memory</i>
<i>over and over again.</i>

707
01:08:37,794 --> 01:08:40,854
<i>He was animal. Faceless.</i>

708
01:08:41,731 --> 01:08:42,891
<i>lnfinite.</i>

709
01:08:44,767 --> 01:08:47,167
<i>But then he would feel it,</i>

710
01:08:47,236 --> 01:08:49,204
<i>the emptiness returning,</i>

711
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:52,833
<i>and the need would rise in him again.</i>

712
01:09:01,184 --> 01:09:02,208
Go! Go!

713
01:09:02,285 --> 01:09:03,684
-ln here?
-A detour. Go.

714
01:09:03,753 --> 01:09:05,015
<i>When summer came,</i>

715
01:09:05,087 --> 01:09:08,545
<i>he noticed young lovers</i>
<i>would sneak into the cornfield.</i>

716
01:09:09,192 --> 01:09:11,660
<i>He began to follow them</i>

717
01:09:11,727 --> 01:09:13,058
<i>and watch.</i>

718
01:09:29,979 --> 01:09:31,776
Will you come to bed?

719
01:09:33,249 --> 01:09:34,910
Yeah. Soon.

720
01:09:55,877 --> 01:09:57,208
Buckley did this, right?

721
01:09:57,278 --> 01:10:02,648
Correct. He said that this is our house,
this is the police station and that's you.

722
01:10:02,717 --> 01:10:03,706
That's me?

723
01:10:03,785 --> 01:10:05,810
Yeah.
He made you Chief of Police, so...

724
01:10:05,887 --> 01:10:07,286
l've gained 20 pounds.

725
01:10:07,355 --> 01:10:10,916
-lt must be the uniform.
-lt's the dangers of a desk job.

726
01:10:11,626 --> 01:10:14,094
l'd like to report a lost purse.

727
01:10:14,829 --> 01:10:16,854
Why don't you have a seat?

728
01:10:25,106 --> 01:10:27,301
-l'm living with this every day.
-What about your marriage?

729
01:10:27,375 --> 01:10:28,740
-What marriage?
-You just don't give up!

730
01:10:28,810 --> 01:10:30,778
-Jack is sleeping in his study!
-He's trying.

731
01:10:30,845 --> 01:10:32,642
You have to find a way to keep going.

732
01:10:32,713 --> 01:10:33,907
-Mother...
-You don't have a choice.

733
01:10:33,981 --> 01:10:37,246
-l am coping with this.
-You can't give up. You have to...

734
01:10:37,318 --> 01:10:38,444
-Oh, no, Mother.
-Bingo!

735
01:10:38,519 --> 01:10:39,679
That is cooking sherry!

736
01:10:39,754 --> 01:10:42,348
-Please! Please!
-You have to find a way to live with this.

737
01:10:42,423 --> 01:10:45,187
-Live with it? l am living with this!
-You're not!

738
01:10:45,259 --> 01:10:47,386
-l'm dealing... l'm coping...
-You don't go into Susie's room.

739
01:10:47,462 --> 01:10:49,862
-l'm dealing with it! So what?
-You won't let anybody touch her things!

740
01:10:49,931 --> 01:10:52,832
You have a tomb
in the middle of your house!

741
01:10:54,802 --> 01:10:57,293
Sweetheart, do you really think
if you seal it up

742
01:10:57,371 --> 01:10:59,771
that the pain's going to go away?

743
01:12:04,338 --> 01:12:07,171
<i>My mother went as far away</i>
<i>as she could.</i>

744
01:12:07,241 --> 01:12:11,439
<i>She found a job in a small orchard</i>
<i>outside of Santa Rosa.</i>

745
01:12:11,512 --> 01:12:14,413
<i>The work was hard, but she didn't mind.</i>

746
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:19,981
<i>lf anyone asked,</i>
<i>she said she had two children.</i>

747
01:12:36,337 --> 01:12:37,736
<i>And Lindsey,</i>

748
01:12:38,606 --> 01:12:41,404
<i>who always said</i>
<i>she didn't believe in love,</i>

749
01:12:43,044 --> 01:12:44,636
<i>found it anyway.</i>

750
01:13:07,969 --> 01:13:09,493
<i>And there it was.</i>

751
01:13:10,071 --> 01:13:12,301
<i>The moment l would never have.</i>

752
01:13:14,408 --> 01:13:16,876
<i>My little sister had run ahead of me.</i>

753
01:13:18,546 --> 01:13:20,275
<i>She was growing up.</i>

754
01:13:24,819 --> 01:13:27,720
What's the matter?
l thought you'd be happy.

755
01:13:28,623 --> 01:13:29,988
l am happy.

756
01:13:34,161 --> 01:13:35,685
l'm very happy.

757
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:38,298
Then why are you crying?

758
01:13:39,667 --> 01:13:41,862
No. You think she did not want
to kiss him?

759
01:13:41,936 --> 01:13:42,960
No.

760
01:13:44,372 --> 01:13:45,600
She did.

761
01:13:47,608 --> 01:13:50,008
She wanted to kiss him very much.

762
01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:05,918
<i>Always, l would watch Ray.</i>

763
01:14:07,228 --> 01:14:09,355
<i>l was in the air around him.</i>

764
01:14:10,531 --> 01:14:14,558
<i>l was in the cold winter mornings</i>
<i>he spent with Ruth Connors,</i>

765
01:14:15,703 --> 01:14:18,536
<i>that strange, otherworldly girl</i>

766
01:14:18,606 --> 01:14:23,600
<i>who so easily accepted the presence</i>
<i>of the dead among the living.</i>

767
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:32,076
<i>And sometimes, Ray would think of me.</i>

768
01:14:34,221 --> 01:14:36,712
<i>But he began to wonder,</i>

769
01:14:36,791 --> 01:14:39,624
<i>maybe it was time</i>
<i>to put that memory away.</i>

770
01:14:41,796 --> 01:14:44,094
<i>Maybe it was time to let me go.</i>

771
01:14:50,905 --> 01:14:52,395
What was that?

772
01:14:52,473 --> 01:14:55,101
-l'm sorry.
-What was... What was that?

773
01:15:04,318 --> 01:15:05,979
Lindsey, throw it!

774
01:15:51,031 --> 01:15:53,966
<i>My murderer had finely tuned instincts.</i>

775
01:15:54,902 --> 01:15:57,166
<i>He knew my sister had begun to wonder</i>

776
01:15:57,238 --> 01:16:00,730
<i>about the solitary man</i>
<i>who lived in the green house.</i>

777
01:16:02,810 --> 01:16:05,244
<i>She seemed intent on crowding him,</i>

778
01:16:06,647 --> 01:16:08,376
<i>and he resented it.</i>

779
01:16:27,334 --> 01:16:31,202
<i>He began to feel a familiar itch.</i>

780
01:17:31,165 --> 01:17:33,224
-Mom, look!
-Just a second.

781
01:17:43,744 --> 01:17:44,870
Careful, honey.

782
01:17:45,946 --> 01:17:47,038
Mom!

783
01:17:54,622 --> 01:17:57,455
<i>Pretty, aren't they?</i>
<i>They are so beautiful.</i>

784
01:19:21,842 --> 01:19:23,173
Mom, look!

785
01:19:24,745 --> 01:19:26,235
Hey, Dad, look at me!

786
01:20:42,589 --> 01:20:44,113
Mr. Salmon.

787
01:20:44,191 --> 01:20:45,215
Hi.

788
01:20:48,962 --> 01:20:50,429
What is that?

789
01:20:52,599 --> 01:20:54,965
lt's just a project l'm working on.

790
01:20:55,035 --> 01:20:57,367
-You're a hunter?
-Ducks.

791
01:21:00,374 --> 01:21:02,501
-That's a blind, right?
-Yep.

792
01:21:03,444 --> 01:21:06,140
-So those things really work?
-Oh, yeah.

793
01:21:08,615 --> 01:21:12,210
lt's all about concealment,
the art of concealment,

794
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:14,815
and patience.

795
01:21:14,888 --> 01:21:18,790
lt takes a lot of patience.
l sit for hours on end in the dark.

796
01:21:19,693 --> 01:21:21,320
l'm an outdoorsman.

797
01:21:21,829 --> 01:21:23,456
Always have been.

798
01:21:46,653 --> 01:21:48,018
Mr. Salmon?

799
01:21:51,992 --> 01:21:53,789
l just...

800
01:21:53,861 --> 01:21:57,820
l never got a chance to tell you
how sorry l am about your loss.

801
01:22:23,690 --> 01:22:24,918
<i>Dad.</i>

802
01:22:45,646 --> 01:22:48,513
Here. Let me. Let me help you.

803
01:22:48,582 --> 01:22:50,277
Oh, no. That's all right.
Really, l can manage.

804
01:22:50,350 --> 01:22:52,113
No, it's no trouble.

805
01:22:55,022 --> 01:22:56,353
All right.

806
01:22:56,990 --> 01:22:58,480
Appreciate it.

807
01:23:03,497 --> 01:23:04,794
This is for you.

808
01:23:04,865 --> 01:23:07,732
Oh, thank you, Mr. Harvey,
you really shouldn't.

809
01:23:08,669 --> 01:23:10,000
-You're welcome.
-Oh, that does smell...

810
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:11,332
lt's a beautiful smell, isn't it?

811
01:23:13,373 --> 01:23:16,069
-Hey, look at me!
-Careful, honey.

812
01:23:24,017 --> 01:23:27,919
Oh, that really does smell delicious.

813
01:23:28,755 --> 01:23:30,620
-Beautiful, yeah.
-Dad!

814
01:23:30,691 --> 01:23:33,353
They are something.

815
01:23:33,860 --> 01:23:35,657
Hey, Dad, look at me!

816
01:24:02,456 --> 01:24:05,823
l think it's time for you to go home now,
Mr. Salmon.

817
01:24:17,170 --> 01:24:18,535
Go on home.

818
01:24:25,746 --> 01:24:27,077
l'm sorry.

819
01:24:28,682 --> 01:24:30,309
l can't help you.

820
01:24:32,019 --> 01:24:35,819
What did you do to her?
What did you do to my daughter?

821
01:24:35,889 --> 01:24:37,789
Tell me! Where is she?

822
01:24:39,026 --> 01:24:40,493
lt's got to stop, Jack!

823
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,926
You came this close
to getting arrested tonight!

824
01:24:42,996 --> 01:24:45,624
You're lucky George Harvey declined
to press charges.

825
01:24:45,699 --> 01:24:47,257
Lucky?

826
01:24:47,334 --> 01:24:49,461
Your father put a hole
in the man's back door.

827
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:51,265
Yeah, he should have put a hole
in his head.

828
01:24:51,338 --> 01:24:53,306
-Lindsey, please.
-Did you hear that, Jack?

829
01:24:53,373 --> 01:24:55,273
This is the example you're setting
for your kids?

830
01:24:55,342 --> 01:24:56,434
Persecuting the neighbors!

831
01:24:56,510 --> 01:24:58,341
-He's not crazy!
-l didn't say that.

832
01:24:58,412 --> 01:25:02,371
-Well, then why won't you listen to him?
-Because you need evidence, Lindsey.

833
01:25:02,449 --> 01:25:05,885
You can't go around making
accusations against George Harvey

834
01:25:05,952 --> 01:25:08,887
when you have no evidence.
You need proof.

835
01:25:08,955 --> 01:25:11,048
You are pathetic.

836
01:25:11,124 --> 01:25:12,614
Why can't you just admit it?

837
01:25:12,693 --> 01:25:15,355
You stopped looking for her
a long time ago.

838
01:25:15,429 --> 01:25:16,828
Len's right.

839
01:25:17,864 --> 01:25:19,729
He's right.

840
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,927
lt's time to put this behind us.

841
01:25:22,002 --> 01:25:23,867
lt's gone on too long.

842
01:25:24,304 --> 01:25:25,931
This has to stop.

843
01:25:26,406 --> 01:25:27,737
Dad...

844
01:25:27,808 --> 01:25:30,333
Things will take
their natural course, Lindsey.

845
01:25:30,410 --> 01:25:34,972
Len, l appreciate everything you've done.
You've been a great friend to me.

846
01:25:38,618 --> 01:25:40,711
That goes for Abigail, too.

847
01:25:41,421 --> 01:25:44,219
You've been a great friend to both of us.

848
01:26:28,869 --> 01:26:30,894
<i>Murder changes everything.</i>

849
01:26:41,448 --> 01:26:44,747
<i>When l was alive, l never hated anyone.</i>

850
01:26:45,986 --> 01:26:48,955
<i>But now, hate was all that l had.</i>

851
01:26:49,723 --> 01:26:51,315
l want him dead.

852
01:26:52,893 --> 01:26:57,830
l want him cold and dead
with no blood in his veins!

853
01:27:02,903 --> 01:27:04,268
Look at me.

854
01:27:05,906 --> 01:27:07,931
Look at what he did to me!

855
01:27:09,142 --> 01:27:10,700
What am l now?

856
01:27:10,777 --> 01:27:15,214
The dead girl?
The lost girl? The missing girl?

857
01:27:15,949 --> 01:27:17,348
l'm nothing!

858
01:27:49,649 --> 01:27:51,116
l was stupid.

859
01:27:53,753 --> 01:27:55,618
l was so stupid!

860
01:27:55,689 --> 01:27:57,247
You don't control this, Susie.

861
01:28:13,807 --> 01:28:15,570
He does not own you.

862
01:28:17,577 --> 01:28:21,411
You can be free of him, but not this way.

863
01:28:21,481 --> 01:28:24,973
What do you know?
You don't know anything.

864
01:28:25,051 --> 01:28:27,110
That man took my life!

865
01:28:29,890 --> 01:28:34,418
You will see, Susie.
ln the end, you will understand.

866
01:28:37,264 --> 01:28:38,822
Everybody dies.

867
01:29:02,756 --> 01:29:04,417
-Brian!
-Just a little further in. Keep going.

868
01:29:04,491 --> 01:29:06,686
-Keep going.
-Okay, okay, l'm coming!

869
01:29:20,974 --> 01:29:22,032
Dad?

870
01:29:23,310 --> 01:29:24,368
Dad!

871
01:29:25,779 --> 01:29:28,247
Dad! Dad!

872
01:29:28,315 --> 01:29:32,081
<i>l realized what l had done.</i>
<i>l willed him to stop.</i>

873
01:29:39,893 --> 01:29:41,918
<i>l willed him to turn back.</i>

874
01:29:48,802 --> 01:29:50,394
l know it's you!

875
01:29:51,037 --> 01:29:52,299
Come out!

876
01:29:53,106 --> 01:29:54,903
Come out and face me!

877
01:29:55,842 --> 01:29:58,367
Did you hear me, you son of a bitch?

878
01:30:03,984 --> 01:30:05,349
Get off me!

879
01:30:06,052 --> 01:30:07,542
You sick fuck!

880
01:30:09,956 --> 01:30:13,119
Brian, stop! Please, stop!

881
01:30:15,128 --> 01:30:18,256
Brian, stop! Brian, stop it!

882
01:30:18,331 --> 01:30:20,356
You want to touch my girl?

883
01:30:22,569 --> 01:30:23,593
Dad!

884
01:30:26,406 --> 01:30:27,498
Dad!

885
01:30:32,112 --> 01:30:33,170
No.

886
01:30:33,246 --> 01:30:34,645
Brian, stop!

887
01:30:38,885 --> 01:30:40,819
Brian, stop! Stop!

888
01:30:42,455 --> 01:30:44,980
Don't you get it? You've killed him!

889
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:48,552
-He's dead!
-Go.

890
01:30:48,628 --> 01:30:50,528
-He's dead!
-Go! Go!

891
01:32:19,719 --> 01:32:23,155
<i>l knew then he would never give me up.</i>

892
01:32:24,958 --> 01:32:27,950
<i>He would never count me</i>
<i>as one of the dead.</i>

893
01:32:30,997 --> 01:32:32,726
<i>l was his daughter.</i>

894
01:32:34,467 --> 01:32:36,128
<i>And he was my dad.</i>

895

-Would you like some help?
-Yeah, sure. That'd be great.

941
01:50:25,204 --> 01:50:27,399
l come here almost every day.

942
01:50:30,709 --> 01:50:33,007
l like to listen to the sounds.

943
01:50:34,680 --> 01:50:36,443
Have you seen Holly?

944
01:50:37,449 --> 01:50:39,883
Did she tell you about this place?

945
01:50:41,286 --> 01:50:42,344
Yes.

946
01:50:44,890 --> 01:50:46,790
Then you must be ready.

947
01:50:47,826 --> 01:50:49,589
l'm Flora Hernandez.

948
01:50:51,730 --> 01:50:53,925
The others will be here soon.

949
01:51:03,342 --> 01:51:04,604
Who's that?

950
01:51:04,676 --> 01:51:07,577
l don't know,
but he gives me the skeevies.

951
01:51:07,646 --> 01:51:09,944
The skeevies? What are you, 12?

952
01:53:07,666 --> 01:53:09,190
lt's beautiful.

953
01:53:11,536 --> 01:53:13,527
Of course it's beautiful.

954
01:53:14,906 --> 01:53:16,305
lt's heaven!

955
01:53:39,564 --> 01:53:42,590
All right, come on. Let's go. l got to...

956
01:53:49,141 --> 01:53:51,769
What are you waiting for? You're free!

957
01:53:58,683 --> 01:53:59,877
Almost.

958
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:03,051
Not quite.

959
01:54:14,232 --> 01:54:15,290
Ray!

960
01:54:23,175 --> 01:54:24,233
Ray!

961
01:54:54,139 --> 01:54:55,231
Ruth!

962
01:54:56,775 --> 01:54:58,265
What happened?

963
01:55:02,881 --> 01:55:03,939
Hey.

964
01:55:07,285 --> 01:55:08,752
What's wrong?

965
01:55:16,394 --> 01:55:17,486
Ruth?

966
01:55:40,252 --> 01:55:41,412
Susie?

967
01:55:45,590 --> 01:55:47,922
You wrote me a poem once.

968
01:55:51,263 --> 01:55:53,458
You called yourself the Moor.

969
01:56:03,108 --> 01:56:06,168
That's good. l got it. l'll take it from here.

970
01:56:19,724 --> 01:56:21,248
Kiss me.

971
01:57:27,525 --> 01:57:30,016
You are beautiful, Susie Salmon.

972
01:57:51,716 --> 01:57:56,653
<i>These were the lovely bones</i>
<i>that had grown around my absence.</i>

973
01:57:58,390 --> 01:58:01,917
<i>The connections, sometimes tenuous,</i>

974
01:58:03,728 --> 01:58:06,026
<i>sometimes made at great cost,</i>

975
01:58:07,365 --> 01:58:09,765
<i>but often magnificent</i>

976
01:58:12,170 --> 01:58:14,866
<i>that happened after l was gone.</i>

977
01:58:17,642 --> 01:58:20,042
<i>And l began to see things in a way</i>

978
01:58:21,012 --> 01:58:23,037
<i>that let me hold the world</i>

979
01:58:24,783 --> 01:58:26,410
<i>without me in it.</i>

980
01:58:44,969 --> 01:58:46,937
lt's a cold one tonight!

981
01:58:54,112 --> 01:58:56,012
You looking for a ride?

982
01:58:58,049 --> 01:58:59,107
No.

983
01:59:00,452 --> 01:59:01,476
No?

984
01:59:03,655 --> 01:59:06,146
Are you sure? Pretty cold out here.

985
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:11,588
l'll take you wherever you want to go.

986
01:59:13,631 --> 01:59:14,996
What do you think?

987
01:59:15,066 --> 01:59:18,467
Look, mister, l'm not interested, okay?

988
01:59:19,571 --> 01:59:23,063
l'm not trying to do nothing.
Just trying to be polite.

989
01:59:23,141 --> 01:59:24,506
That's all.

990
01:59:25,543 --> 01:59:29,411
-A young lady alone at night, not safe.
-Didn't you hear me?

991
01:59:29,481 --> 01:59:30,743
Piss off!

992
02:00:29,207 --> 02:00:32,040
<i>When my mother came to my room,</i>

993
02:00:32,110 --> 02:00:36,740
<i>l realized that all this time</i>
<i>l had been waiting for her.</i>

994
02:00:38,950 --> 02:00:41,077
<i>l had been waiting so long.</i>

995
02:00:42,654 --> 02:00:44,952
<i>l was afraid she wouldn't come.</i>

996
02:00:48,726 --> 02:00:50,387
l love you, Susie.

997
02:01:02,073 --> 02:01:04,701
<i>Nobody notices when we leave.</i>

998
02:01:04,776 --> 02:01:08,371
<i>l mean, the moment</i>
<i>when we really choose to go.</i>

999
02:01:09,647 --> 02:01:14,641
<i>At best, you might feel a whisper</i>
<i>or the wave of a whisper</i>

1000
02:01:15,253 --> 02:01:16,845
<i>undulating down.</i>

1001
02:01:19,591 --> 02:01:22,651
<i>My name is Salmon, like the fish.</i>

1002
02:01:23,828 --> 02:01:25,489
<i>First name, Susie.</i>

1003
02:01:26,764 --> 02:01:29,790
<i>l was 1 4 years old</i>
<i>when l was murdered</i>

1004
02:01:29,868 --> 02:01:33,133
<i>on December 6, 1973.</i>

1005
02:01:37,675 --> 02:01:39,575
<i>l was here for a moment,</i>

1006
02:01:41,813 --> 02:01:43,576
<i>and then l was gone.</i>

1007
02:01:46,284 --> 02:01:49,845
<i>l wish you all a long and happy life.</i>
