The Warren Commission, almost a full
year after the Kennedy assassination...

00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:02,732
- Glenn, it's time.
- No, just a little more.

4
00:03:02,824 --> 00:03:07,036
If you don't get up right now,
I'm gonna cut one of your piano strings.

5
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:09,114
Ugh...

6
00:03:09,206 --> 00:03:11,662
- What time is it?
- Quarter to seven.

7
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:15,374
- A quarter to seven!
- Mm-hm.

8
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:17,540
Oh, God.

9
00:03:18,425 --> 00:03:20,667
Does the sun really come out this early?

10
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:25,637
It was a surprise to me, too. I took
a picture in case it never happens again.

11
00:03:25,725 --> 00:03:29,972
- Nobody gets up this early.
- Oh, yes, they do.

12
00:03:30,063 --> 00:03:33,895
Come on, come on, come on.
Please, please, please, please, please!

13
00:03:33,984 --> 00:03:37,816
- Come on, come on, come on, come on.
- No, no, no! This is a stupid idea.

14
00:03:37,905 --> 00:03:40,740
Oh, this is definitely not my scene, Iris.

15
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:45,454
It's just a gig. If it doesn't work,
you can try something else.

16
00:03:46,247 --> 00:03:49,202
- What time am I supposed to be there?
- 7.30.

17
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:51,369
7.30!

18
00:03:52,004 --> 00:03:56,298
What kind of people like to
go to work at 7.30 in the morning?

Hi. I'm Glenn Holland.
I'm the new music teacher.

Vice Principal Wolters.

34
00:04:56,283 --> 00:04:58,360
Holy cow!

35
00:05:00,288 --> 00:05:01,948
- A Corvair.
- Yeah.

36
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,911
I take it you didn't read
Ralph Nader's book.

37
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:08,121
Well, unless Ralph
is willing to buy me a new car,

38
00:05:08,213 --> 00:05:11,748
I'm gonna have to stick with this one
until the wheels fall off.

39
00:05:11,842 --> 00:05:15,176
Well, you may not have to
wait that long. Heh-heh.

40
00:05:16,973 --> 00:05:19,678
- Have a nice day.
- Thanks.

00:05:27,485 --> 00:05:29,561
You look lost, Mr Holland.

44
00:05:31,072 --> 00:05:33,907
Helen Jacobs. Remember? I hired you.

45
00:05:33,992 --> 00:05:36,281
Oh!

46
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:42,076
Of course you did. I'm sorry. It was not
that I'm lost. I was just looking for the...

47
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:46,248
- Well, yes, of course I'm lost.
- What an auspicious beginning.

48
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,916
This way.

49
00:05:49,425 --> 00:05:52,925
Your first day as a teacher,
Mr Holland. Excited?

50
00:05:53,013 --> 00:05:56,299
Nervous. Boy, I never thought I'd be here.

51
00:05:56,392 --> 00:05:58,598
No? Why not?

52
00:05:58,686 --> 00:06:02,137
Well... like most people,
I only got my teaching certificate

53
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:04,687
so I'd have something to fall back on.

54
00:06:04,776 --> 00:06:07,694
This isn't a drive-in, Mr Claridge.
Hands off!

55
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:12,240
You know, Mr Holland, I don't think
of teaching as a fallback position.

56
00:06:12,326 --> 00:06:15,280
- No, no...
- I grow nervous around people who do.

57
00:06:15,371 --> 00:06:18,456
I'm... I'm really very happy
to be here. Really.

58
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:24,247
Good. You'll drop by my office later on.
I have a list of students You'll be advising.

59
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:29,085
Advising? Can I ask when
I'm supposed to be doing this advising?

60
00:06:29,178 --> 00:06:33,306
that's for you and the student to arrange.
You meet your orchestra when?

61
00:06:33,391 --> 00:06:35,467
Fifth period.

62
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:38,970
- Are they any good?
- They try hard.

63
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:43,109
By the way, I'll need a complete
lesson plan from you by Friday.

64
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,900
- Right.
- For September and October.

65
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,186
Right.

66

All right. People, come on,
let's take our seats a little quicker, please.

69
00:07:31,622 --> 00:07:35,490
A little quicker. We're losing time.
Come on in, come on in.

70
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:37,661
My name is Mr Holland.

71
00:07:38,838 --> 00:07:43,299
This, of course, is a title of courtesy
that I will extend back to you -

72
00:07:43,552 --> 00:07:47,253
"Mr" or "Miss",
as the circumstances allow.

73
00:07:47,348 --> 00:07:49,424
Welcome to Music Appreciation.

74
00:07:49,517 --> 00:07:55,057
This is a class in which we will be
studying the history of music.

75
00:07:55,148 --> 00:07:59,442
Um, who would like to give me
a definition of what music is?

76
00:08:01,238 --> 00:08:03,314
Any music. What do you think?

77
00:08:04,408 --> 00:08:09,949
What do they think that music is
in... in general? What do they think?

78
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:12,116
Anybody?

79
00:08:13,877 --> 00:08:15,953
Nobody?

80
00:08:16,505 --> 00:08:20,966
OK. Let's, uh... let's go to the text.

81
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:26,346
And we turn to page, um... four.

82
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:35,106
And we read that "Music is sound
in melodic or harmonic combinations,

83
00:08:35,192 --> 00:08:37,980
whether produced
by voice or instrument."

84
00:08:39,405 --> 00:08:41,482
Now, questions?

85
00:08:42,534 --> 00:08:44,859
Anybody... at all?

86
00:08:47,873 --> 00:08:49,830
No?

87
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:50,866
Hm?

88
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,703
Good.

89
00:08:52,795 --> 00:08:54,752
All righty, uh...

90
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:01,970
Now, I just... you know, I just...
want you all to relax, have a little fun.

91
00:09:02,055 --> 00:09:04,891
We're not here to impress each other.

92
00:09:04,975 --> 00:09:07,549
OK. All right, let's get ready.

93
00:09:09,856 --> 00:09:11,932
Everyone? Come on.

94
00:09:14,986 --> 00:09:17,478
You ready?

95
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:20,108
OK, here we go.

96
00:09:20,576 --> 00:09:24,028
(~ discordant `Symphony No 5
in C Minor``` by Beethoven)

00:10:07,962 --> 00:10:09,705
It was good.

98
00:10:09,797 --> 00:10:12,549
Miss Aronson.
Would you stand up, please?

99
00:10:13,426 --> 00:10:15,300
Stand up, please.

100
00:10:15,387 --> 00:10:20,594
Is that skirt regulation length?
On your knees, both of you, right now.

101
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:25,974
I thought so. Come with me to the
principal's office. You are going home.

102
00:10:26,065 --> 00:10:28,639
You can come back
when you're dressed properly.

103
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,562
- You're not being fair.
- I am.

104
00:10:30,653 --> 00:10:33,690
If I allow you to do it,
everyone is allowed to do it.

105
00:10:33,782 --> 00:10:36,071
- Hi.
- Hi.

106
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,447
Come on, out of my way.

107
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:46,244
- Teachers don't wait.
- Pardon me?

108
00:10:46,337 --> 00:10:49,374
High school is not a democracy.
Teachers don't wait.

- Hi.

111
00:10:58,351 --> 00:11:01,471
- There you go.
- Oh, my God!

112
00:11:01,563 --> 00:11:05,643
- What is this?
- It's Monday. It's Turkey Spam Surprise.

113
00:11:06,234 --> 00:11:08,358
You could mortar walls with it.

114

Word of advice: always bring a bag lunch.

- Where's yours?
- I ate it in second period.

116
00:11:14,243 --> 00:11:17,363
Sylvie! don't tease me. I need extra.

117
00:11:17,956 --> 00:11:20,625
So what have you been doin'
for the last ten years?

118
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:23,829
I've been playing music.
Been on the road.

119
00:11:23,921 --> 00:11:29,295
You know, um... clubs and weddings
and bar mitzvahs. That sort of thing.

120
00:11:29,385 --> 00:11:33,430
Wait a minute. I bet you met
a ton of chicks in those clubs, huh?

121
00:11:33,515 --> 00:11:37,014
So you're in these clubs,
there are all these women there...

122
00:11:37,102 --> 00:11:39,807
- Why'd you become a teacher?
- Well...

123
00:11:39,897 --> 00:11:42,768
Actually, I started teaching
because I was hoping

124
00:11:42,858 --> 00:11:47,236
it would give me some free time to do
some composing. I'm a composer.

125
00:11:50,742 --> 00:11:53,530
- What? what's so funny?
- Oh, the free time.

126
00:11:55,789 --> 00:11:59,372
Glenn, I can't remember
the last time I had that was free.

127
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:27,649
(Iris) I've got it all figured out.

128
00:12:27,741 --> 00:12:31,027
With your salary, plus what I take in
with the photography,

129
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,658
in four years we should have
enough for you to quit

130
00:12:33,748 --> 00:12:39,123
and do nothing but compose music
and become famous and make us rich.

131
00:12:39,212 --> 00:12:42,582
- I'll never make it.
- I made us $32 today.

132
00:12:42,675 --> 00:12:46,969
Big deal. I made 32 kids
sleep with their eyes open.

133
00:12:47,054 --> 00:12:49,131
Oh, right there! Yeah.

134
00:12:50,183 --> 00:12:52,721
Right there. Yeah.

135
00:12:57,566 --> 00:13:03,237
Iris... I think this is gonna be
a lot rougher gig than I originally thought.

136
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:11,611
You know, when I was in high school...
I wanted to be someplace else, you know.

137
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,664
Anyplace.

138
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:17,879
It never occurred to me that
my teachers would feel the same way.

139
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,384
Well... you can still quit.

140
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:26,593
- Nah. We've been through all that.
- The band's getting pretty good.

141
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:29,517
We could play Holiday Inns
for the rest of our lives.

142
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:33,813
- Or Los Angeles.
- I don't wanna be a studio musician.

143
00:13:34,816 --> 00:13:37,058
So, It's four years' teaching, then.

144
00:13:42,282 --> 00:13:44,358
Come here.

145
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,035
When you were in high school...

146
00:13:53,628 --> 00:13:56,962
did you ever wonder
if your teachers got it on at night?

147
00:13:57,049 --> 00:14:01,094
When I was in high school
my teachers were all priests and nuns.

148
00:14:02,263 --> 00:14:07,803
I had such a crush on Mr Griffith.
He could've taken me home any time.

149
00:14:07,894 --> 00:14:10,219
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

150
00:14:10,313 --> 00:14:12,721
And who was this Mr Griffith?

151
00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:16,232
Oh... he was my music teacher.

154
00:14:40,597 --> 00:14:42,305
OK. OK.

00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,308
That wasn't bad. That wasn't bad at all.

156
00:14:45,394 --> 00:14:47,766
- Miss...? I'm sorry.
- Lang.

157
00:14:47,855 --> 00:14:50,524
- Pardon me?
- Lang. Gertrude Lang.

158
00:14:51,317 --> 00:14:57,652
OK. Miss Lang, um... would you
take it from bar 37, please?

159
00:15:07,835 --> 00:15:09,912
(~ discordant notes)

160
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:19,798
(whispering and giggling)

161
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,468
OK. OK.

162
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:24,928
- (school bell)
- Good. Good. that's enough for today.

163
00:15:25,021 --> 00:15:27,808
I'll see you all tomorrow. Very good work.

164
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:31,518
Miss Lang? Would you mind
hanging for a moment, please?

165
00:15:40,038 --> 00:15:43,573
You seem to be having a little trouble
getting through the break.

166
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:45,873
I know.

167
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:48,832
- How long have you been playing?
- Three years.

168
00:15:50,424 --> 00:15:52,832
Really?

169
00:15:52,927 --> 00:15:54,386
Uh...

170
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,555
Do you find that you get
all the practice time that you need?

171
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,132
I practise constantly, yeah.

172
00:16:03,647 --> 00:16:05,723
Well...

173
00:16:06,775 --> 00:16:11,272
then I think... I think maybe
you and I should find some time

174
00:16:11,364 --> 00:16:13,606
to work on an individual basis.

175
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,535
- That would be great.
- I don't have a lot of time, but...

176
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,033
that's OK. Whatever you can give me.
I really, really wanna do good at this.

177
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,201
I bet you do. Um...

178
00:16:23,836 --> 00:16:29,590
Well, come in about a half-hour before
first period tomorrow and we'll just start...

179
00:16:29,676 --> 00:16:34,006
OK. All right. Thank you...
thank you very much. Thanks.

180
00:17:02,003 --> 00:17:06,500
When a flat precedes a note, like this,

181
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:11,301
it indicates that the note
is to be played a half-step lower.

182
00:17:12,306 --> 00:17:14,299
A piece based in F major

183
00:17:14,392 --> 00:17:17,975
should have a flat sign
at the beginning of every stave.

184
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:22,965
These tests... are pathetic.

185
00:18:27,264 --> 00:18:30,100
"Name an American composer."

186
00:18:30,184 --> 00:18:33,719
Miss Swedlin, your answer was...?

187
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,356
"Bach"?

188
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,014
"Johann Sebastian Bach."

189
00:18:40,404 --> 00:18:42,646
Oh, this is my favourite one.

190
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:47,034
"How do you know
what key a concerto is in?"

191
00:18:47,954 --> 00:18:54,372
Mr Mims, your answer was
"Look on the front page?"

192
00:18:55,504 --> 00:18:59,502
Now, this question mark -
was that because you weren't sure?

193
00:18:59,592 --> 00:19:04,503
Or because your English skills are on
the same level as your musical theory?

194
00:19:04,597 --> 00:19:08,180
These tests are a waste
of my time, and yours!

195
00:19:08,268 --> 00:19:11,353
No kidding! I'd rather be somewhere else.

196
00:19:11,438 --> 00:19:15,686
Mr Sullivan! Why don't you pay a visit
to Mr Wolters, right now!

197
00:19:15,776 --> 00:19:18,149
Get your books and get outta here!

198
00:19:22,033 --> 00:19:25,485
As for the rest of you,
get your textbooks out.

199
00:19:25,579 --> 00:19:30,455
We're gonna go over these answers
one by one until you get them right.

200
00:19:30,543 --> 00:19:32,619
(school bell)

201
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,186
(~ discordant clarinet)

202
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:06,911
Give it up, Miss Lang.

203
00:20:09,544 --> 00:20:11,620
(sobbing)

204
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:35,856
I meant for the day.

205
00:20:36,532 --> 00:20:39,653
- I meant "Give it up for the day".
- I know what you meant.

206
00:20:39,744 --> 00:20:42,449
Then... why are you crying?

207
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:44,615
I'm terrible. I'm...

208
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:49,996
I'm terrible. I practise till my lips swell up,
but all I make is noise.

209
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:52,627
It takes work
to learn a musical instrument.

210
00:20:52,717 --> 00:20:55,921
I just... I just wanna be good at something.

211
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:59,887
My sister's got a ballet scholarship
to go to Juilliard,

212
00:20:59,975 --> 00:21:04,602
and my brother's going to Notre Dame
on a football scholarship.

213
00:21:04,689 --> 00:21:08,390
My mother's won the blue ribbon
for watercolours at the state fair

214
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:11,154
so many times
they've retired the category.

215
00:21:11,238 --> 00:21:14,523
My father's got the most
beautiful voice. he's...

216
00:21:17,202 --> 00:21:19,694
I'm the only one in my family who's...

217
00:21:20,748 --> 00:21:23,286
I... I just can't...

218
00:21:24,085 --> 00:21:25,579
(sobbing)

219
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:28,541
It doesn't make any difference anyway. I...

220
00:21:35,806 --> 00:21:38,843
Mr Holland!
Just the man I was looking for.

221
00:21:38,935 --> 00:21:41,604
We're forming a textbook committee
for next year.

222
00:21:41,688 --> 00:21:46,231
I would like to have your suggestions. We
meet next Tuesday night in the library.

223
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:49,568
Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs Jacobs.
I'm very busy on Tuesday night.

224
00:21:49,655 --> 00:21:51,363
Uh-huh?

225
00:21:51,449 --> 00:21:55,198
You know, for a good four or five months
now, I've been watching you.

226
00:21:55,286 --> 00:21:58,620
I've never seen a teacher
sprint for the parking lot

227
00:21:58,707 --> 00:22:01,412
with more speed and enthusiasm
than his students.

228
00:22:01,501 --> 00:22:03,909
Perhaps you should be our track coach.

229
00:22:04,004 --> 00:22:08,085
Mrs Jacobs, I get here on time
every morning, don't I?

230
00:22:08,176 --> 00:22:10,548
I'm doing my job the best I can.

231
00:22:10,678 --> 00:22:14,842
A teacher is two jobs.
Fill young minds with knowledge, yes.

232
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:18,302
But, more important,
give those minds a compass

233
00:22:18,395 --> 00:22:20,471
so that knowledge doesn't go to waste.

234
00:22:20,564 --> 00:22:23,056
I don't know what you do
with the knowledge,

235
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,724
but as a compass, you're stuck.

236
00:22:30,826 --> 00:22:35,903
I really hate that woman!
And I hate teaching, Iris. I hate it.

237
00:22:35,998 --> 00:22:38,620
Nobody could teach
these children. Nobody!

238
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,166
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

239
00:22:41,254 --> 00:22:46,759
They just sit there, staring up at me.
there's no there there. I've been trying...

240
00:22:46,843 --> 00:22:50,758
You played a lot of tough houses.
When they didn't listen, did you quit?

241
00:22:50,848 --> 00:22:55,178
Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Aren't we
supposed to be on the same side?

242
00:22:55,269 --> 00:22:57,061
I am.

243
00:22:57,146 --> 00:22:59,223
It's just that I...

244
00:22:59,941 --> 00:23:01,981
I...

245
00:23:02,694 --> 00:23:04,853
- (sighs)
- What?

246
00:23:07,992 --> 00:23:10,068
I'm pregnant.

247
00:23:12,121 --> 00:23:20,296
I wasn't... I wasn't sure if I was,
but I went to the doctor and I... I am.

248
00:23:23,342 --> 00:23:25,418
We are.

249
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:31,675
S...

250
00:23:32,227 --> 00:23:34,136
Say something.

251
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:42,274
Wow.

252
00:24:04,388 --> 00:24:06,464
Iris...

253
00:24:07,266 --> 00:24:12,059
- Iris...
- I... I don't know. I knew!

254
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:17,852
- I knew you wouldn't be, but I just...
- Iris, it just took me by surprise, that's all.

255
00:24:24,994 --> 00:24:27,567
Let me tell you a story, OK?

256
00:24:29,832 --> 00:24:34,495
When I was 15 years old
I used to hang out at a local record store.

257
00:24:34,588 --> 00:24:39,416
There was this guy who worked there
who thought he knew what I liked,

258
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:44,137
and he handed me this album one day
and it was John Coltrane.

259
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:48,894
So I took it home
and I put it on the machine.

260
00:24:49,604 --> 00:24:52,974
And I hated it. I mean, I really hated it.

261
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,523
I just didn't get it.

262
00:24:57,196 --> 00:25:00,897
So I... played it again.

263
00:25:01,993 --> 00:25:04,698
I played it again, and I played it again...

264
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:10,499
and then... I just couldn't stop playin' it.

265
00:25:12,963 --> 00:25:15,455
I kept listening to those notes.

266
00:25:17,886 --> 00:25:24,684
And I realised that... that's what
I wanted to do with the rest of my life.

267
00:25:25,894 --> 00:25:27,971
You know?

268
00:25:29,106 --> 00:25:31,183
Make music.

269
00:25:44,623 --> 00:25:46,700
What am I tryin' to say?

270
00:25:49,295 --> 00:25:51,454
Look, Iris...

271
00:25:51,548 --> 00:25:56,791
Look, you... you tell me that...
We're gonna have a baby.

272
00:25:58,889 --> 00:26:00,966
Well...

273
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:07,932
that's like... falling in love
with John Coltrane...

274
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,061
all over again.

275
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:21,697
If that is a lie,
that is the sweetest lie I ever heard.

276
00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:34,045
- (school bell)
- Let's take our seats, please.

277
00:26:36,931 --> 00:26:41,843
Anybody here know the difference
between the lonian and the Dorian scale?

278
00:26:42,604 --> 00:26:44,681
Anybody?

279
00:26:45,774 --> 00:26:47,233
(chuckles)

280
00:26:47,318 --> 00:26:49,394
I just wanted to confirm the fact

281
00:26:49,487 --> 00:26:54,446
that I've made absolutely no impact
on you in the last five months.

282
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,194
- Mr Sullivan.
- Yeah.

283
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:03,662
What kind of music
do you like to listen to?

284
00:27:03,753 --> 00:27:06,624
- Um...
- don't be afraid.

285
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:10,877
Rock'n'roll.

286
00:27:10,969 --> 00:27:13,425
- What about you?
- Rock'n'roll.

287
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:18,840
- You?
- Classical.

288
00:27:18,936 --> 00:27:21,309
- Brown-noser.
- (laughter)

289
00:27:22,565 --> 00:27:25,270
Does anybody here like
Johann Sebastian Bach?

290
00:27:26,194 --> 00:27:28,401
Other than you?

291
00:27:28,488 --> 00:27:34,029
I'll bet all of you, whether you know it or
not, already like Johann Sebastian Bach.

292
00:27:34,537 --> 00:27:37,110
(~ `A Lover`s Concerto```)

293
00:27:41,753 --> 00:27:44,920
- what's this called?
- (all) "A Lover's Concerto".

294
00:27:45,674 --> 00:27:48,426
- Who wrote it?
- The Toys.

295
00:27:48,511 --> 00:27:49,756
Wrong!

296
00:27:49,845 --> 00:27:55,967
That was "Minuet in G", and it was written
by Johann Sebastian Bach.

297
00:27:56,061 --> 00:27:58,137
(~ `Minuet in G Major``` by Bach)

298
00:28:02,693 --> 00:28:04,769
Can you hear it?

299
00:28:07,198 --> 00:28:09,274
~ Bom-bom, bom-bom, bom

300
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,491
And he wrote it in 1725.

301
00:28:12,579 --> 00:28:16,328
They are both prime examples
of the lonian scale.

302
00:28:16,917 --> 00:28:21,247
Now listen... and see if
you can hear the connective tissue

303
00:28:21,339 --> 00:28:24,673
between what I just played and this.

304
00:28:24,926 --> 00:28:26,634
(~ honky-tonk)

305
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:54,874
.. and they were answering questions
and it was so much fun.

306
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:59,254
It was rowdy, you know.
It was... it was just great.

307
00:29:02,217 --> 00:29:05,088
Hey, hey, hey! What do we think, huh?

308
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:08,762
And it only took two tries and three hours.

309
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:11,471
You didn't realise
you'd married such a handy man!

310
00:29:11,561 --> 00:29:13,850
But now we really don't have any space.

311
00:29:17,651 --> 00:29:22,728
Well... how would you feel
if we moved into a house?

312
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,785
- You're kidding?
- No.

313
00:29:27,954 --> 00:29:30,659
But we can't afford that.

314
00:29:30,749 --> 00:29:35,707
If we used our savings account we could,
and I taught driver's ed in the summer.

315
00:29:35,796 --> 00:29:40,174
- You were gonna compose this summer.
- Well, we could make it work.

316
00:29:40,426 --> 00:29:43,546
- It'd mean taking the crib apart again.
- Never!

317
00:29:44,472 --> 00:29:47,142
I'll tear a wall down first.

318
00:29:48,268 --> 00:29:50,806
It's up to you.

319
00:29:50,896 --> 00:29:53,055
- I think we should do it.
- Really?!

320
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:58,359
Play the song you wrote
that made me fall in love with you.

321
00:29:58,446 --> 00:30:01,151
The song that made you
fall in love with me?

322
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,371
The song that made you...
Oh, yes! The song!

323
00:30:07,122 --> 00:30:10,492
- ~ Give me some men who are...
- No! No!

324
00:30:10,585 --> 00:30:12,661
- No?
- No, come on.

325
00:30:14,881 --> 00:30:16,708
(~ romantic tune)

326
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,876
Mm-hm.

327
00:30:50,295 --> 00:30:52,371
- Mr Holland?
- You're late.

328
00:30:53,007 --> 00:30:55,924
And you left your clarinet here
the other day.

329
00:30:56,427 --> 00:31:00,211
Yeah, um...
if you know anyone who wants it...

330
00:31:02,267 --> 00:31:07,013
I'm giving up the clarinet. I'm just
goofing everybody else up anyway.

331
00:31:07,606 --> 00:31:12,683
So, um... I just wanted to say thanks.
Thanks for trying.

332
00:31:15,865 --> 00:31:17,941
Is it any fun?

333
00:31:23,624 --> 00:31:25,700
I wanted it to be.

334
00:31:28,546 --> 00:31:30,752
You know what We've been doing wrong?

335
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,545
We've been playing the notes on the page.

336
00:31:36,138 --> 00:31:38,427
Well, what else is there to play?

337
00:31:40,142 --> 00:31:43,179
there's a lot more to music
than notes on a page.

338
00:31:44,772 --> 00:31:46,848
(~ `Louie, Louie``` by the Kingsmen)

339
00:31:46,941 --> 00:31:49,017
These guys, for example.

340
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,154
Now... they can't sing,

341
00:31:53,365 --> 00:31:56,817
and they have absolutely
no harmonic sense, and they're...

342
00:31:56,952 --> 00:32:00,867
they're playing the same three chords
over and over again.

343
00:32:00,957 --> 00:32:03,033
And I love it.

344
00:32:03,585 --> 00:32:05,162
- Do you?
- Yeah.

345
00:32:05,253 --> 00:32:07,376
Yeah!

346
00:32:07,464 --> 00:32:09,540
Why?

347
00:32:12,553 --> 00:32:15,127
- I don't know.
- Yeah, you do.

348
00:32:15,806 --> 00:32:18,298
- Because It's fun?
- that's right.

349
00:32:18,393 --> 00:32:22,011
Because playing music
is supposed to be fun.

350
00:32:22,731 --> 00:32:24,973
It's about... heart.

351
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:31,156
It's about feelings and... moving people
and something beautiful and being alive,

352
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,241
and It's not about notes on a page!

353
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:38,871
I could teach you notes on a page.
I can't teach you that other stuff.

354
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,201
Do me a favour.

355
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:46,332
Pick up your clarinet... and play with me.

356
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:50,424
- OK.
- And this time... no music.

357
00:32:50,512 --> 00:32:53,347
- Oh, what...
- Because you already know it.

358
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:57,179
It's in your head and your fingers
and your heart.

359
00:32:57,269 --> 00:32:59,891
You just don't trust yourself to know that.

360
00:33:04,027 --> 00:33:05,854
OK.

- What?

00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,252
When you look in the mirror...
what do you like best about yourself?

374
00:34:05,887 --> 00:34:08,045
My hair.

375
00:34:10,392 --> 00:34:12,550
Why?

376
00:34:12,644 --> 00:34:16,974
Well, my father always says
that it reminds him of a sunset.

377
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,818

our finest young men, into battle.

But as long as there are men
who hate and destroy,

386
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,513
we must have the courage to resist.

387

We will stand in Vietnam.

Try to use one foot! Try to just...

Two feet off! that's it! Right foot.

Coltrane Gershwin Holland!

435
00:41:18,741 --> 00:41:21,279
Mr Holland, it has come to my attention

436
00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:24,738
that you are teaching
the students rock'n'roll.

437
00:41:25,582 --> 00:41:28,868
- Is this a problem?
- Is this a problem? Yes, I think so.

438
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,911
Our only job is to teach. We cannot teach,
and the students cannot learn,

439
00:41:33,007 --> 00:41:35,165
if there is no discipline.

440
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:38,463
I'm sorry, what exactly
is your point, Gene?

441
00:41:38,554 --> 00:41:43,383
My point is rock'n'roll, by its very nature,
leads to a breakdown in discipline.

442
00:41:43,477 --> 00:41:46,264
Would you like me
to deny that rock'n'roll exists?

443
00:41:46,355 --> 00:41:50,732
What I am... what we are saying is that
you should be pushing the classics.

444
00:41:50,818 --> 00:41:53,190
Brahms. Mozart. Stravinsky.

445
00:41:53,279 --> 00:41:57,028
Stravinsky was the music
of the Russian Revolution.

446
00:41:57,117 --> 00:42:00,984
- You are exaggerating.
- How about the Kingston Trio, Gene?

447
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:06,205
- How about "Sing Along With Mitch"?
- Just a minute, gentlemen!

448
00:42:06,293 --> 00:42:11,964
Mr Holland, I do not want to interfere
in the curriculum of any teacher.

449
00:42:12,175 --> 00:42:15,425
But next week I have a meeting
with the school board.

450
00:42:15,512 --> 00:42:21,800
There are people who believe rock'n'roll
is a message sent from the devil himself.

451
00:42:21,894 --> 00:42:25,595
Now when that issue comes up,
what can I tell them?

452
00:42:29,945 --> 00:42:32,317
Mrs Jacobs,

453
00:42:32,406 --> 00:42:36,107
you tell them that I am teaching music,

454
00:42:37,161 --> 00:42:42,073
and that I will use anything, from
Beethoven to Billie Holiday to rock'n'roll...

455
00:42:43,126 --> 00:42:48,002
if I think it'll help me teach a student
to love music.

456
00:42:49,883 --> 00:42:52,090
that's...

457
00:42:52,178 --> 00:42:54,669
a reasonable answer, Mr Holland.

458
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:58,132
I can tell them that.

459
00:42:59,561 --> 00:43:02,099
Was there somethin' else?

460
00:43:05,901 --> 00:43:08,309
Yes. Um...

461
00:43:08,404 --> 00:43:12,817
have you been to any of the football
games this season, Mr Holland?

462
00:43:13,952 --> 00:43:16,408
I can't say that I have, no.

463
00:43:17,122 --> 00:43:20,954
Well, Mrs Jacobs and I
feel that there's something missing.

464
00:43:21,377 --> 00:43:23,453
Touchdowns. (chuckles)

465
00:43:24,797 --> 00:43:26,873
I'm sorry.

466
00:43:29,427 --> 00:43:32,097
What do you know
about marching bands?

467
00:43:34,558 --> 00:43:35,838
Pardon me?

468
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:39,846
Set! Hut!

469
00:43:40,648 --> 00:43:42,724
Get him! Get him down!

470
00:43:44,277 --> 00:43:46,768
that's the way!
that's the way to crash down!

471
00:43:46,863 --> 00:43:48,441
(Holland) Uh...

472
00:43:48,532 --> 00:43:50,571
drums and sousaphones.

473
00:43:50,659 --> 00:43:54,657
Come on, line up here -
sousaphones on either side, and...

474
00:43:55,873 --> 00:44:00,951
baritones and saxes here. Third line.

475
00:44:01,045 --> 00:44:02,919
Put your shirt-tail in!

476
00:44:03,006 --> 00:44:06,173
This isn't a dance.
It looks like a party dress! Get it in!

477
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:10,092
Let's do it a little quicker.
We don't wanna be here till It's dark.

478
00:44:10,181 --> 00:44:14,890
Now, We're not even, and I'd like
to make some attempt to, um...

479
00:44:14,978 --> 00:44:18,062
Can you even up here?
Can you, like, even this...?

480
00:44:18,148 --> 00:44:21,102
Do you understand what I'm saying
when I say even up?

481
00:44:21,193 --> 00:44:23,269
Line up. There you go!

482
00:44:24,196 --> 00:44:28,277
All right, all right.
Take care of "even" some... next time.

483
00:44:28,367 --> 00:44:31,404
Get over here! What are you doing?

484
00:44:31,496 --> 00:44:33,619
- Sorry.
- Are you tryin' to kill me?

485
00:44:33,707 --> 00:44:35,996
Watch my hand, OK?

486
00:44:36,084 --> 00:44:40,213
One, two, three, march!

487
00:44:40,297 --> 00:44:46,751
Left, right. Left, right. Left, right.
Left, right. Left, right. Left, right.

488
00:44:46,846 --> 00:44:48,554
No! No! No!

489
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,302
- Left, right. Left, right. Left, right.
- Hey, John. Let 'em take a knee.

490
00:44:53,395 --> 00:44:55,933
No, no, no. You're clumping up.

491
00:44:56,023 --> 00:44:58,182
No, no, no. People, spread out.

492
00:44:58,275 --> 00:45:02,108
I want you to spread! Spread out! Spread.

493
00:45:02,197 --> 00:45:05,648
And turn. Turn around.
And keep marching!

494
00:45:05,867 --> 00:45:13,449
Keep marching. Left, right. Left, right.
Left, right. Left, right. Left...

495
00:45:18,339 --> 00:45:22,124
- Stop! Take a knee.
- (laughter)

496
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,924
All right, start runnin'! Hats on!

497
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:28,891
And don't stop till you hear this whistle.

498
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:32,474
Glenn. Glenn.

499
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:37,149
Man! Oh, man! Oh, man! Oh, man!

500
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:41,061
I take it you were never in the army.

501
00:45:42,992 --> 00:45:45,661
Now, that's a stupid question!

502
00:45:46,746 --> 00:45:49,830
I was. Man, I marched my keister off.

503
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:52,910
Well, then help me out.

504
00:45:55,672 --> 00:45:57,749
OK.

505
00:45:58,801 --> 00:46:02,004
You see this kid up in the stands here?
that's Lou Russ.

506
00:46:02,096 --> 00:46:06,308
He was the greatest halfback ever. I had
to toss him off the team cos of his grades.

507
00:46:06,393 --> 00:46:08,350
I'm about to lose him for wrestling.

508
00:46:08,436 --> 00:46:12,933
What are we talking about? What do you
want me to do? Take his tests for him?

509
00:46:13,025 --> 00:46:14,685
No.

510
00:46:14,777 --> 00:46:17,019
But I bet if he played in your band,

511
00:46:17,113 --> 00:46:22,238
I could talk Jacobs into giving him an
academic credit. And then I'll help you.

512
00:46:22,327 --> 00:46:25,245
- What instrument does he play?
- He doesn't.

513
00:46:28,959 --> 00:46:31,035
He doesn't play anything.

514
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,214
- What, are you kidding?
- No. He'll fit right in.

515
00:46:38,094 --> 00:46:41,760
Glenn, listen.
You get him to play anything...

516
00:46:42,474 --> 00:46:44,550
and I'll get them to march.

517
00:46:48,189 --> 00:46:52,602
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Coach Meister, your marching buddy.

518
00:46:54,154 --> 00:46:56,859
You know anything at all
about music, Mr Russ?

519
00:46:56,949 --> 00:47:00,532
- No, sir, Coach.
- You don't have to say "sir".

520
00:47:00,619 --> 00:47:03,324
I'm not a coach,
so "Mr Holland" is just fine.

521
00:47:03,539 --> 00:47:05,698
I'm sorry, sir. I mean, Mr Holland.

522
00:47:05,792 --> 00:47:09,375
don't apologise -
you haven't done anything yet. Um...

523
00:47:11,381 --> 00:47:14,003
You know how to read music?
Even a little?

524
00:47:16,178 --> 00:47:18,504
- No.
- No. No...

525
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:23,682
Well, you do realise
that you're gonna have to learn

526
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:28,064
at least some of the fundamentals of
music before you can get into the band?

527
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:33,026
Listen, Mr Holland. I work hard.
I know how to work hard.

528
00:47:33,114 --> 00:47:35,272
I'm just not a school type of person.

529
00:47:37,201 --> 00:47:39,278
OK.

530
00:47:39,704 --> 00:47:43,952
Well, which instrument
do you think you'd like to play?

531
00:47:44,376 --> 00:47:47,627
Well, I was kinda thinking...
How about electric guitar?

532
00:47:48,464 --> 00:47:52,082
Well, this is a marching band.
The extension cord would kill us.

533
00:47:52,176 --> 00:47:55,462
- How about the tuba?
- Tuba's are for fat guys with pimples!

534
00:47:55,638 --> 00:47:59,257
Well, given the time constraints,
how do drums strike you?

535
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:01,806
A drum!

536
00:48:16,036 --> 00:48:18,112
You're ahead, Mr Russ!

537
00:48:25,296 --> 00:48:27,622
Get on the beat, Mr Russ.

538
00:48:32,221 --> 00:48:35,056
Whoa, whoa! Stop, stop.
Stop, stop, stop! Stop.

539
00:48:35,141 --> 00:48:38,806
- What happened? Where did you go?
- I keep losin' my place.

540
00:48:39,395 --> 00:48:41,684
Well, why don't you find it?

541
00:48:42,023 --> 00:48:45,393
Enough of us here
already think that time is a magazine,

542
00:48:45,485 --> 00:48:49,780
and I don't want you confusing us
any further and, by the way, Mr Barr...

543
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:54,570
it is not, as they say, considered couth

544
00:48:54,954 --> 00:48:58,822
to empty your spit valve
in the middle of the performance.

545
00:48:58,917 --> 00:49:02,251
Especially not on the foot
of the person sitting next to you.

546
00:49:02,337 --> 00:49:06,501
Let's take it again from the top.
One, two. One, two.

547
00:49:15,811 --> 00:49:20,105
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, who, whoa!
Whoa, whoa! Stop, stop. Stop!

548
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,267
(school bell)

549
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:27,271
Boy, were you saved by the bell! Same
time, same place tomorrow. Thank you.

550
00:49:29,409 --> 00:49:34,914
- Mr Holland? I just want you to know...
- That you're gonna work hard. I know.

551
00:49:34,998 --> 00:49:37,537
- Thanks, Mr Holland.
- You're welcome.

552
00:49:39,629 --> 00:49:44,006
Tell me some stories about the chicks
you met when you were on the road.

553
00:49:44,092 --> 00:49:47,592
That was a different time.
I was a very different guy.

554
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:49,755
Check.

555
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,769
You must be keeping something
so good from me!

556
00:49:53,853 --> 00:49:56,854
- You avoid that question.
- I'm not avoiding anything!

557
00:49:56,939 --> 00:49:59,727
- I know you are.
- I lead a very different life now.

558
00:49:59,818 --> 00:50:03,982
I have a beautiful wife, a gorgeous child -
something you know nothing about.

559
00:50:04,072 --> 00:50:05,816
Check.

560
00:50:05,908 --> 00:50:09,324
- I wanna have kids someday.
- You ought to find a wife first.

561
00:50:09,412 --> 00:50:11,488
I don't want kids that badly.

562
00:50:12,832 --> 00:50:14,908
Checkmate.

563
00:50:16,336 --> 00:50:18,874
All right, all right, all right.

564
00:50:18,964 --> 00:50:22,001
Besides, the kids at school
are like my kids.

565
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:27,387
I wanna smack 'em sometimes, but
mostly I just wanna see 'em do good.

566
00:50:28,141 --> 00:50:30,430
So, Lou Russ - he gonna make it?

567
00:50:32,687 --> 00:50:34,764
Is he gonna make it?

568
00:50:36,024 --> 00:50:39,690
- I don't think so.
- Glenn, come on. I need him!

569
00:50:40,279 --> 00:50:42,817
A kid doesn't wrestle,
It's not the end of the world.

570
00:50:42,907 --> 00:50:46,442
For him, it is! If he doesn't wrestle,
he doesn't have anything else.

571
00:50:46,536 --> 00:50:48,825
It's not about wrestling. I care about him.

572
00:50:48,914 --> 00:50:52,330
How can I keep a kid in the band
if he can't play an instrument?

573
00:50:52,418 --> 00:50:56,083
You teach him. Are you telling me
that you cannot teach

574
00:50:56,172 --> 00:50:59,173
a willing kid like Lou Russ
to bang a drum?

575
00:50:59,258 --> 00:51:00,801
- I tried!
- No, you teach him.

576
00:51:00,885 --> 00:51:04,005
- I tried, and I can't.
- Then you're a lousy teacher.

577
00:51:05,182 --> 00:51:10,010
And I just can't see a chance like this
getting away from him if I can stop it!

578
00:51:15,193 --> 00:51:17,482
Look, I was a kid just like him,

579
00:51:17,862 --> 00:51:23,154
and if someone hadn't given me a chance
to excel in the one thing I was good at,

580
00:51:23,243 --> 00:51:28,120
I never would have become the brilliant,
gum-chewing coach that I am.

581
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:39,208
I was kept off the chess team,
and, well, It's ruined my life.

582
00:51:43,724 --> 00:51:45,005
Do it again.

617
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:51,337
No, no! No! No, no, no, no.
Back. Back! Back, back. Just relax.

618
00:54:51,432 --> 00:54:53,555
- Let's go!
- Take a deep breath.

619
00:54:53,643 --> 00:54:56,430
- Let's go!
- We're doing the best we can, damn it!

620
00:54:58,023 --> 00:55:00,099
Hold it, hold it.

621
00:55:01,276 --> 00:55:03,602
Ready? Mr Benson.

622
00:55:03,821 --> 00:55:05,897
One, two, three, four.

(~ `Louie, Louie```)

624
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:43,073
Now we have a real treat
coming down the road -

625
00:55:43,156 --> 00:55:45,315
the John F Kennedy marching band.

626
00:55:45,867 --> 00:55:48,240
And arent they good?

627
00:55:48,328 --> 00:55:51,864
Their first year in this parade,
led by Glenn Holland.

628
00:56:10,436 --> 00:56:13,437
that's my boy! Hey, Louis! Louis!

629
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:16,267
Louis!

630
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:19,187
Louis!

631
00:56:26,204 --> 00:56:28,280

633
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:21,047
Cole!

634
00:57:22,433 --> 00:57:24,722
Was that fun, or what?

635
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:27,136
there's something wrong with Cole.

636
00:57:27,772 --> 00:57:31,224
- What?
- I don't know. I've tried different things.

637
00:57:31,317 --> 00:57:36,525
Um... sneaking up behind him and
banging pots and screaming his name

638
00:57:36,615 --> 00:57:39,153
and stomping on the floor.

639
00:57:39,243 --> 00:57:42,908
He turned when I did that - big smile.
He thought I was playing a game.

640
00:57:42,997 --> 00:57:45,073
Iris.

641
00:57:46,501 --> 00:57:49,253
I don't think he can hear.

642
00:58:02,101 --> 00:58:03,512
Cole?

643
00:58:03,603 --> 00:58:05,679
(claps)

644
00:58:06,273 --> 00:58:07,767
Cole?

645
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,897
(louder) Cole!

646
00:58:15,616 --> 00:58:17,693
Cole? (claps)

647
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:25,161
(doctor) Cole has
a 90 per cent hearing loss.

648
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:28,835
With training, he will learn to use
what hearing he has left.

649
00:58:28,923 --> 00:58:33,003
Treat him as if he's normal.
Talk to him as if he can hear you.

650
00:58:33,094 --> 00:58:36,879
I notice Cole uses gestures
to help himself be understood.

651
00:58:36,973 --> 00:58:40,841
Let me caution you: don't use them back.

652
00:58:40,936 --> 00:58:44,769
Gestures won't help him
find his place in a hearing world.

653
00:58:44,857 --> 00:58:49,983
When he's older, there are schools that
will help him, and you, to find his voice.

(~ `Symphony No 7 in A Major```
by Beethoven)

655
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:05,746
He couldn't hear.

656
00:59:06,464 --> 00:59:08,541
Of all people.

657
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,049
Not a thing.

658
00:59:12,638 --> 00:59:14,963
And because Beethoven couldn't hear,

659
00:59:15,057 --> 00:59:22,685
the thought of him conducting, let alone
composing, was pathetic to most people.

660
00:59:22,774 --> 00:59:27,235
And so, to answer them, he composed
and conducted the 7th Symphony.

661
00:59:31,450 --> 00:59:33,858
Just try to imagine:

662
00:59:33,953 --> 00:59:36,491
Beethoven, standing on that podium...

663
00:59:37,999 --> 00:59:40,076
holding his baton...

664
00:59:40,836 --> 00:59:44,288
his hands waving gracefully
through the air...

665
00:59:46,008 --> 00:59:51,003
and the orchestra in his mind
was playing perfectly.

666
00:59:53,767 --> 00:59:59,106
And the orchestra in front of him...
trying desperately just to keep up.

667
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,811
There is a story...

668
01:00:07,991 --> 01:00:11,325
that, in order to write his music,

669
01:00:11,411 --> 01:00:14,911
Beethoven literally
sawed the legs off his piano

670
01:00:14,999 --> 01:00:18,119
so that he could lay the body
flat on the ground.

671
01:00:19,545 --> 01:00:21,622
And then...

672
01:00:22,423 --> 01:00:27,845
he would lay down on the ground next to
the piano with his ear pressed to the floor.

673
01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:32,808
And he would pound the keys
with his fingers...

674
01:00:35,229 --> 01:00:40,984
in order to hear his music
through the vibrations of the floor.

675
01:00:43,071 --> 01:00:45,444
Mr Holland?

676
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,860
Mr Holland?

677
01:00:51,622 --> 01:00:55,952
If he couldn't hear, how would he
even know what the notes were?

678
01:00:56,837 --> 01:01:02,211
Like, if he never heard a C, how'd he
know that's what he wanted played?

679
01:01:09,392 --> 01:01:11,468
Well...

680
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:17,016
Beethoven wasn't born deaf.

the days of the week
and the months of the year.

733

Would you care to step out
for just a moment? Shall we?

734
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,145
What was yesterday?

735
01:06:15,231 --> 01:06:17,603
- Can we talk about tuition?
- Yes.

736
01:06:17,692 --> 01:06:20,100
Is there any chance
of government subsidy?

737
01:06:20,195 --> 01:06:23,895
- I'm afraid not.
- Well, we can handle it.

738

So how long would it be
before he learns how to sign?

739
01:06:28,412 --> 01:06:30,535
Not as long as it'll take the two of you.

740
01:06:30,623 --> 01:06:33,494
You see, children learn very quickly.

741
01:06:33,584 --> 01:06:37,167
But adults, well, so much depends
on how much you put into it.

742
01:06:37,255 --> 01:06:40,292
Mm-hm. And when would we begin?

743
01:06:40,384 --> 01:06:45,342
Our next intensive programme, the one
geared towards parents, starts in June.

744
01:06:45,431 --> 01:06:48,598
It's three months, three hours every day.

You'll think you were born in detention.

I can give you all the names
and dates you want.

- I know all the scales, counterpoint...
- So what?

760
01:07:50,294 --> 01:07:55,087
This class is Music Appreciation.
I don't see you appreciating anything.

761
01:07:55,175 --> 01:07:57,844
- This is such lame bullshit.
- Sit down!

762
01:08:00,097 --> 01:08:03,632
You are this close
from being suspended, pal.

763
01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:14,148
You think you are real smart, don't you?

764
01:08:15,572 --> 01:08:19,191
OK... prove it.

765
01:08:19,994 --> 01:08:22,567
I want a paper on my desk
by the end of term.

766
01:08:22,663 --> 01:08:26,247
I want it to be single-spaced.
I want it to be annotated.

767
01:08:26,334 --> 01:08:29,786
I want the name of this report to be
Music, the Language of Emotion.

768
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,585
- You can't make me do that.
- Watch me!

769
01:08:34,093 --> 01:08:36,666
You don't do it, you flunk.

770

This isn't fair, Mr Holland!

01:08:38,931 --> 01:08:42,764
- Life is not fair, pal.
- Mr Holland?

772
01:08:55,491 --> 01:08:57,568
Yeah.

773
01:08:59,037 --> 01:09:01,789
- Tell Mrs Jacobs I'll take care of it.
- OK.

774
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:06,786
- Am I released yet?
- No.

775
01:09:12,469 --> 01:09:16,134
I want you to meet me here
Saturday morning at 10am.

776
01:09:16,223 --> 01:09:17,931
Why?

777
01:09:18,016 --> 01:09:20,093
Research.

778
01:09:23,397 --> 01:09:27,265
We are honoured and we are proud
that we have known him.

779
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:29,816
And our lives are for ever changed.

780
01:09:30,989 --> 01:09:33,361
Louis's gifts live in each of us.

781
01:09:34,868 --> 01:09:40,112
Let us burn bright his spirit,
his courage, his love.

782
01:09:41,334 --> 01:09:43,410
- Amen.
- (all) Amen.

783
01:09:47,758 --> 01:09:53,428
"In Flanders" fields the poppies blow
Between the crosses, row on row

784
01:09:53,514 --> 01:09:55,590
That mark our place

785
01:09:56,642 --> 01:10:00,059
And in the sky
The larks, still bravely singing, fly

786
01:10:00,146 --> 01:10:03,646
Scarce heard among the guns below..."

787
01:10:04,401 --> 01:10:10,191
So, uh, who's the...
who's the one, uh... you know?

788
01:10:13,244 --> 01:10:16,910
that's some kid I taught to bang a drum,
named Louis Russ.

789
01:10:19,543 --> 01:10:24,834
He made the state wrestling finals
three years running.

790
01:10:29,512 --> 01:10:34,887
He was never as smart as you are. He had
to work real hard... even to graduate.

791
01:10:38,147 --> 01:10:40,685
Maybe that's why
it meant so much to him.

792
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:42,859
(gunshot)

793
01:10:43,903 --> 01:10:45,397
Aim.

794
01:10:45,488 --> 01:10:47,362
- Fire.
- (gunshot)

795
01:10:47,449 --> 01:10:50,022
- Aim. Fire.
- (gunshot)

796
01:10:51,245 --> 01:10:53,451
Present arms.

797
01:10:56,125 --> 01:10:58,201
(~ last post)

798
01:11:30,329 --> 01:11:33,117
On behalf of the president
and a grateful nation,

799
01:11:33,208 --> 01:11:36,743
I present this flag in recognition
of your son, Corporal Louis Russ,

800
01:11:36,837 --> 01:11:39,410
for his long and faithful service
to his country.

801
01:11:40,883 --> 01:11:44,086
March! Face! Forward!

802
01:11:50,727 --> 01:11:53,099
You can go home now.

803
01:12:09,039 --> 01:12:11,115
Hi, Glenn.

804
01:12:12,459 --> 01:12:15,496
- You OK?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm all right.

805
01:12:19,634 --> 01:12:21,710
What a waste.

806
01:12:23,972 --> 01:12:26,048
We know too many of these kids.

807
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:31,888
Come on... let's get outta here.

808
01:13:02,849 --> 01:13:05,850
Of course, Daisy was also
the former Miss Idaho.

809
01:13:05,935 --> 01:13:09,186
- Her dress is made of potato skins.
- Stop it! Nice to meet you.

810
01:13:09,272 --> 01:13:10,980
- This is Glenn.
- Nice to meet you.

811
01:13:11,066 --> 01:13:12,975
- And this is Iris.
- Hello.

812
01:13:13,068 --> 01:13:16,023
Cole. Say hi. This is Cole.

813
01:13:16,113 --> 01:13:18,605
- Hello, everybody.
- (all) Hi.

814
01:13:18,699 --> 01:13:22,745
- Mr Holland, a word.
- With you, It's never just one word.

815
01:13:26,041 --> 01:13:29,742
- What are your plans for the summer?
- Oh, the usual, I guess.

816
01:13:29,837 --> 01:13:33,372
The Clyde Crashcup School
of Driver's Ed. What about you?

817
01:13:33,466 --> 01:13:37,927
I'm going to be very busy.
Gardens to plant, grandchildren to visit.

818
01:13:38,012 --> 01:13:40,089
I'm retiring, Mr Holland.

819
01:13:42,267 --> 01:13:44,343
What?

820
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:49,399
I've been promising my husband
for several years now. It's time.

821
01:13:50,610 --> 01:13:52,686
I have something for you.

822
01:13:57,534 --> 01:14:00,204
A memento, if you will.

823
01:14:14,595 --> 01:14:17,050
I'm honoured.

824
01:14:17,139 --> 01:14:22,098
Mr Holland, of all the teachers here
at John F Kennedy High School...

825
01:14:24,314 --> 01:14:26,805
you're my favourite.

826
01:14:35,117 --> 01:14:37,194
(~ `The Pretender``` by Jackson Browne)

827
01:14:42,209 --> 01:14:46,289
~ Im gonna rent myself a house

828
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:49,547
~ In the shade of the freeway

829
01:14:52,345 --> 01:14:55,346
~ Gonna pack my lunch in the morning

830
01:14:56,641 --> 01:15:00,591
~ And go to work each day

831
01:15:01,605 --> 01:15:03,764
~ And when the evening rolls around

832
01:15:03,858 --> 01:15:06,146
(Holland) Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

833
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:07,646
~ Ill go on home

834
01:15:07,737 --> 01:15:13,277
Therefore... I shall resign the presidency,
effective at noon tomorrow.

835
01:15:13,368 --> 01:15:14,993
~ Comes streaming in

836
01:15:15,078 --> 01:15:17,155
~ Ill get up and do it again

837
01:15:18,290 --> 01:15:19,868
~ Amen

838
01:15:19,959 --> 01:15:22,913
~ Caught between the longing for love

839
01:15:23,004 --> 01:15:26,836
~ And the struggle for the legal tender

840
01:15:30,011 --> 01:15:32,170
~ Where the sirens sing

841
01:15:32,264 --> 01:15:34,471
~ And the church bells ring

842
01:15:35,851 --> 01:15:38,425
(Holland) You're going the wrong way!

843
01:15:39,564 --> 01:15:42,933
~ Where the veterans dream of the fight

844
01:15:43,777 --> 01:15:47,063
~ Fast asleep at the traffic light

845
01:15:48,699 --> 01:15:55,034
~ And the children solemnly wait
for the ice cream vendor

846
01:15:57,250 --> 01:16:00,999
~ Out into the cool of the evening

847
01:16:01,088 --> 01:16:03,793
~ Strolls the Pretender

848
01:16:07,094 --> 01:16:11,044
~ He knows that all his hopes and dreams

849
01:16:12,016 --> 01:16:14,093
~ Begin and end there

850
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:18,354
(Wolters) All right, moving on.
People, let's get through this.

851
01:16:18,482 --> 01:16:21,851
Please! If we could move on
to the next item of the agenda,

852
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:25,609
- which is the senior-class play.
- Oh, yes. Yes.

853
01:16:25,698 --> 01:16:29,613
After our critical success last year
with Romeo and Juliet...

854
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:35,330
Mr Holland and I have come up with a
wonderful idea for this year's production.

855
01:16:35,417 --> 01:16:38,288
We're not doing a full production,
but a review.

856
01:16:38,379 --> 01:16:43,041
A George and Ira Gershwin review -
very few costumes, one set.

857
01:16:43,134 --> 01:16:44,213
(Holland) Cheaper...

858
01:16:44,302 --> 01:16:48,929
This will bother you, but we have to
consider cutting the senior-class play.

859
01:16:49,016 --> 01:16:53,228
Are you nuts? You know what?
Oddly enough, It's gonna bother me.

860
01:16:53,312 --> 01:16:57,524
People. People, please.
Let's keep in mind why we are here.

861
01:16:57,608 --> 01:17:01,060
We're looking for things
which keep money in the school coffers.

862
01:17:01,154 --> 01:17:04,488
- At the expense of what?
- I have a responsibility.

863
01:17:04,574 --> 01:17:08,193
To the Board of Education.
There just isn't the money to fund...

864
01:17:08,287 --> 01:17:11,241
- Why are we teaching any of this?
- Let's move on.

865
01:17:11,332 --> 01:17:14,582
- This kind of thing is important to me.
- Excuse me. Gene.

866
01:17:16,504 --> 01:17:18,414
Yes... Bill?

867
01:17:18,507 --> 01:17:21,543
I can guarantee that this year's show
will make money.

868
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:26,636
- I'm listening.
- My football players dance in the show.

869
01:17:26,724 --> 01:17:29,678
People will show up
just to see 'em fall on their asses.

870
01:17:29,769 --> 01:17:32,973
- I don't want to turn it into a farce.
- It wouldn't be a farce.

871
01:17:33,064 --> 01:17:35,734
They'll be better than
the June Taylor Dancers.

872
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:38,059
That'll shock the hell out of everybody.

873
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:41,320
Who's going to teach
the football players how to dance?

874
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:45,867
- Me.
- (laughter)

875
01:17:47,038 --> 01:17:50,205
- You?
- I minored in modern dance.

876
01:17:52,836 --> 01:17:55,873
He minored in modern dance, Gene.

877
01:17:57,133 --> 01:18:01,047
I did. The coach had us do it
so we'd be more graceful.

878
01:18:02,472 --> 01:18:04,548
Glenn, hold my leg. Come on.

- Smile!

Thank you. Thank you very much.

906
01:19:30,653 --> 01:19:34,485
- We still don't have an ingnue.
- We still have more people to see.

907
01:19:34,574 --> 01:19:36,816
Billy Faraday can pull off the Gershwin,

908
01:19:36,910 --> 01:19:40,611
but the only ingnue we seem
to have so far is Todd Markham.

909
01:19:40,706 --> 01:19:42,864
I really don't think that Todd Markham...

910

Maybe It's just me, but I think
she's better than Todd Markham.

Very good.

You were very, very good.
Thank you... very much.

01:20:49,198 --> 01:20:51,321
- You wanna go to the what?
- Stars.

928
01:20:51,409 --> 01:20:53,900
Cole discovered astronomy tonight.

929
01:20:56,248 --> 01:20:59,866
Whoa! Whoa, slow down.
Slow down, you're goin' like a rocket!

930
01:21:00,085 --> 01:21:03,289
He wants to be an astronaut.

931
01:21:05,424 --> 01:21:07,501
Good.

932
01:21:10,221 --> 01:21:14,516
- Who put that stuff in his head?
- As a matter of fact, his teachers.

933
01:21:15,435 --> 01:21:17,927
I thought you were going to meet us.

934
01:21:18,481 --> 01:21:22,146
Well, I wanted to, but I had to get
these orchestrations finished.

935
01:21:22,235 --> 01:21:24,311
We're gonna do a Gershwin review.

936
01:21:24,404 --> 01:21:26,562
It's always something, isn't it?

937
01:21:26,656 --> 01:21:29,492
If it isn't a school play, It's band practice,

938
01:21:29,576 --> 01:21:32,827
or grading papers,
or a student committee needs an advisor.

939
01:21:32,913 --> 01:21:36,283
- Missing it isn't the end of the world.
- Maybe you didn't hear me.

940
01:21:36,375 --> 01:21:39,994
- I heard you.
- He wanted you to be there tonight!

941
01:21:40,547 --> 01:21:41,958
Oh, God!

942
01:21:42,048 --> 01:21:47,388
You know what's really amazing? No
matter what I do, no matter how hard I try,

943
01:21:47,471 --> 01:21:50,721
sooner or later, anything I try
turns out being wrong.

944
01:21:50,808 --> 01:21:53,679
Why is every child
more important than your child?

945
01:21:53,770 --> 01:21:56,439
- I'm a teacher, Iris.
- You are his father!

946
01:21:56,523 --> 01:21:58,599
I'm both!

947
01:21:59,192 --> 01:22:03,819
I do one thing, I let him down.
I do another thing, I let the school down.

948
01:22:03,906 --> 01:22:06,029
I can't be everything for everybody.

949
01:22:06,117 --> 01:22:08,786
- You have to make priorities.
- I have!

950
01:22:08,870 --> 01:22:12,868
he's my son, and I love him.
I do the best I goddamn can, OK?

951
01:22:12,957 --> 01:22:15,116
Well, your best isn't good enough.

952
01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:17,452
So go on, write your music!

953
01:22:20,341 --> 01:22:25,087
Write my music, huh? Write my music?!
When do I have time to write my music?

954
01:22:32,855 --> 01:22:38,015
~ won't you tell him please
to put on some speed

955
01:22:38,110 --> 01:22:40,898
~ Follow my lead?

956
01:22:40,989 --> 01:22:44,358
~ Oh, how I need

957
01:22:45,827 --> 01:22:57,371
~ Someone to watch over me

958
01:22:58,174 --> 01:23:01,590
- (ripple of applause)
- That was perfect, darling.

959
01:23:01,678 --> 01:23:04,514
- Mr Holland?
- It was good.

960
01:23:04,598 --> 01:23:07,136
- Can I talk to her for a second?
- Sure.

961
01:23:07,226 --> 01:23:09,468
Let's all take a break for a minute.

962
01:23:10,813 --> 01:23:13,768
- I was trying to sing my best.
- It was fine.

963
01:23:13,858 --> 01:23:15,934
I just wanna ask you a question.

964
01:23:18,071 --> 01:23:21,441
What do you think
the girl's really feeling here?

965
01:23:25,204 --> 01:23:27,695
- I don't know.
- You have to know.

966
01:23:28,374 --> 01:23:30,533
Or you can't sing it.

967
01:23:30,877 --> 01:23:34,081
This song is wistful, Miss Morgan.

968
01:23:34,965 --> 01:23:39,378
It's about a woman who is alone
in a very, very cold world,

969
01:23:39,470 --> 01:23:44,429
and all she wants more than anything
is to have someone hold her close.

970
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:48,809
And to tell her that everything's
gonna be all right.

971
01:23:49,022 --> 01:23:51,478
It's about...

972
01:23:51,567 --> 01:23:53,809
the need for love...

973
01:23:54,737 --> 01:23:57,109
in your gut.

974
01:23:58,032 --> 01:23:59,408
OK?

975
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:03,529
We'll try it again, from the top.

976
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:06,740
This time I wanna do it in a lower key.

977
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:13,039
(~ piano intro)

978
01:24:13,674 --> 01:24:16,047
~ there's a saying old

979
01:24:16,136 --> 01:24:19,137
~ Says that love is blind

980
01:24:20,182 --> 01:24:22,424
~ Still We're often told

981
01:24:22,518 --> 01:24:25,519
~ "Seek and ye shall find"

982
01:24:26,689 --> 01:24:31,268
~ So I'd like to seek a certain lad

983
01:24:32,195 --> 01:24:37,985
~ I've had in mind

984
01:24:59,141 --> 01:25:02,890
- Hi, Mr Holland.
- Hey, Miss Morgan.

985
01:25:02,979 --> 01:25:05,268
What are you working on?

986
01:25:05,357 --> 01:25:07,480
Nothing important.

987
01:25:07,567 --> 01:25:12,146
It's just... sometimes It's easier
to work here than at home.

988
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:15,276
- Would you mind if I joined you?
- No. Not at all.

989
01:25:16,536 --> 01:25:19,490
Want some coffee? Or tea?

990
01:25:19,581 --> 01:25:21,906
- Anything under a buck.
- (giggles)

991
01:25:23,961 --> 01:25:26,286
I always remembered that
about your class -

992
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:29,417
you had this very highly developed
sense of humour.

993
01:25:29,508 --> 01:25:31,086
Thank you.

994
01:25:31,177 --> 01:25:34,178
I loved your class. The way you taught.

995
01:25:36,224 --> 01:25:38,550
You love music,
and you made the kids love it.

996
01:25:38,644 --> 01:25:42,938
- I always wanted to tell you that.
- Well... I'm glad you did.

997
01:25:45,026 --> 01:25:49,320
So, you're a senior now. Got any ideas
about where you're gonna go to college?

998
01:25:49,405 --> 01:25:54,863
No. My mom and dad have a little
restaurant downtown - my dad's dream.

999
01:25:54,953 --> 01:25:57,326
He wants me to stay and help him with it.

1000
01:25:57,748 --> 01:26:00,156
Really?

1001
01:26:00,251 --> 01:26:04,379
- What do you wanna do?
- What do you mean?

1002
01:26:04,714 --> 01:26:06,790
Well, I mean...

1003
01:26:07,551 --> 01:26:09,876
if you had one wish, you know,

1004
01:26:09,970 --> 01:26:14,679
if you could do whatever it is that you
really wanted to do, what would it be?

1005
01:26:18,771 --> 01:26:20,681
Sing.

1006
01:26:20,773 --> 01:26:25,235
I think I'd rather sing than do anything.
I dream about going to New York

1007
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:29,484
and being on the stage
in front of thousands of people.

1008
01:26:29,575 --> 01:26:31,651
that's what I'd wish for.

1009
01:26:35,248 --> 01:26:40,669
Maybe I shouldn't tell you this,
Miss Morgan, but you have a great talent.

1010
01:26:41,546 --> 01:26:44,832
And if you have the passion,
if you have the hunger...

1011
01:26:45,551 --> 01:26:48,671
then you ought to go to New York
and do what you wanna do,

1012
01:26:48,763 --> 01:26:51,254
no matter what anyone tells you.

1013
01:26:51,474 --> 01:26:53,763
(waitress) Can I get you anything?

1014
01:26:53,852 --> 01:26:56,058
No.

1015
01:26:56,146 --> 01:26:58,222
I should get going.

1016
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:05,903
- See you Monday, Mr Holland.
- Yeah. I'll see you later.

1017
01:27:13,749 --> 01:27:15,825
(~ melancholy piece)

1018
01:27:31,185 --> 01:27:33,142
- (discordant note)
- Cole.

1019
01:27:34,063 --> 01:27:37,064
Cole, take this stuff outside. It stinks.

1020
01:27:38,776 --> 01:27:41,446
Go open the window for him.

1021
01:27:41,530 --> 01:27:43,937
Hey! don't bust my butt.

1022
01:27:56,796 --> 01:27:58,873
No, no, no! No, no!

1023
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:02,801
- I don't believe it!
- He didn't do it on purpose.

1024
01:28:02,887 --> 01:28:05,971
Are you kidding me? Of course he did!

1025
01:28:07,266 --> 01:28:09,343
Cole, help clean up.

1026
01:28:21,157 --> 01:28:23,280
Careful.

1027
01:28:23,368 --> 01:28:25,491
Wait. Just wait, wait, wait.

1028
01:28:25,578 --> 01:28:27,655
I'll do it myself.

1029
01:28:30,918 --> 01:28:33,124
- Help me out here.
- he's trying to help.

1030
01:28:33,212 --> 01:28:36,166
he's making a bigger mess
than he already has!

1031
01:28:37,133 --> 01:28:40,087
This is off limits, Cole.
Do you understand?

1032
01:28:40,178 --> 01:28:43,049
- don't touch!
- that's "don't sit".

1033
01:28:50,981 --> 01:28:55,027
~ We may never, never meet again

1034
01:28:55,111 --> 01:28:59,275
- ~ On the bumpy road to love
- don't push.

1035
01:28:59,574 --> 01:29:06,705
~ Still, I'll always, always
keep the memory of

1036
01:29:06,791 --> 01:29:10,836
~ The way you hold your knife

1037
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:14,040
~ The way we danced till three

1038
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:18,591
~ The way you changed my life

1039
01:29:19,805 --> 01:29:21,881
Where did you go?!

1040
01:29:25,395 --> 01:29:27,720
I think we ought to call it quits.

1041
01:29:27,814 --> 01:29:30,649
Could we work on
"Someone to Watch Over Me"?

1042
01:29:30,734 --> 01:29:33,901
- I've been working on it.
- It's pretty late.

1043
01:29:34,822 --> 01:29:36,980
Next time, then.

1044
01:29:49,755 --> 01:29:51,831
what's this?

1045
01:29:53,718 --> 01:29:56,754
Oh, that's what I was working on
the other night.

1046
01:29:56,846 --> 01:29:59,005
You wrote this?

1047
01:29:59,098 --> 01:30:02,515
Well, I... I pick at it once in a while.

1048
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:08,765
Would you play this for me?

1049
01:30:10,486 --> 01:30:12,313
Please.

01:31:15,308 --> 01:31:17,384
Yeah. Yeah.

1060
01:31:17,977 --> 01:31:20,433
- It's just not finished.

1061

Are we?

1063
01:31:32,994 --> 01:31:35,070
Good night, Rowena.

Who's Rowena?

1065
01:32:20,463 --> 01:32:22,540
- Huh?
- Who's Rowena?

1066
01:32:23,467 --> 01:32:25,459
Uh...

1067
01:32:25,552 --> 01:32:28,922
A legend. A heroine
from Norse mythology.

1068
01:32:29,014 --> 01:32:32,051
I got a book about it
somewhere around here.

1069
01:32:32,143 --> 01:32:37,648
I wondered what you thought would be a
good night for Cole and I to see the show.

1070
01:32:37,732 --> 01:32:41,268
- Opening night.
- Yeah! Uh, no. Um...

1071
01:32:41,361 --> 01:32:43,853
I've got a meeting with Cole's teachers.

1072
01:32:43,948 --> 01:32:46,024
Saturday, then.

1073
01:32:47,034 --> 01:32:48,944
Yes.

1074
01:32:49,037 --> 01:32:51,113
Great.

1083
01:33:24,785 --> 01:33:26,065
~ I got my gal

1084
01:33:26,161 --> 01:33:28,533
~ Who could ask for anything more?

1085
01:33:28,997 --> 01:33:32,782
~ Old man trouble, I don't mind him

1086
01:33:33,210 --> 01:33:36,876
~ You won't find him round my door

1087
01:33:37,507 --> 01:33:39,464
~ I got starlight

1088
01:33:39,551 --> 01:33:41,793
~ I got sweet dreams

1089
01:33:41,887 --> 01:33:43,050
~ I got my gal

1090
01:33:43,138 --> 01:33:47,765
~ Who could ask for anything more?
Who could ask for anything more?

1091
01:33:48,769 --> 01:33:56,315
~ Still, I'll always, always
keep the memory of

1092
01:33:56,403 --> 01:34:00,899
~ The way you hold your knife

1093
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:05,494
(Billy) ~ The way we danced till three

1094
01:34:05,747 --> 01:34:09,994
~ The way you changed my life

1095
01:34:10,085 --> 01:34:14,498
~ No, no, they can't
take that away from me

1096
01:34:14,590 --> 01:34:22,598
~ No, they can't take that away from me

1097
01:34:22,682 --> 01:34:24,509
~ I got starlight

1098
01:34:24,601 --> 01:34:26,428
~ I got sweet dreams

1099
01:34:26,728 --> 01:34:28,009
~ I got my gal

1100
01:34:28,105 --> 01:34:29,729
~ Who could ask for anything more?

1101
01:34:29,898 --> 01:34:35,653
~ Who could ask

1102
01:34:35,947 --> 01:34:39,779
~ For anything

1103
01:34:39,868 --> 01:34:45,871
~ Anything more?

1104
01:35:15,949 --> 01:35:18,025
(Holland) Good night, Sarah.

1105
01:35:37,515 --> 01:35:39,591
Mr Holland?

1106
01:35:41,227 --> 01:35:43,303
How was I? The truth.

1107
01:35:45,190 --> 01:35:47,397
You were great.

1108
01:35:47,484 --> 01:35:49,810
- I owe it all to you.
- No...

1109
01:35:51,447 --> 01:35:53,736
No.

1110
01:35:53,824 --> 01:35:55,901
I just accompanied you.

1111
01:35:57,662 --> 01:36:02,621
Mr Holland, I'm doing what you said. I'm
going to New York. I'm gonna be a singer.

1112
01:36:06,213 --> 01:36:09,499
Someday We're all gonna say
that we knew you when...

1113
01:36:09,592 --> 01:36:11,751
No, you don't understand.

1114
01:36:11,844 --> 01:36:15,095
- I'm going tomorrow.
- What?

1115
01:36:15,181 --> 01:36:18,218
there's a party at Miss Olmstead's
after we close the play.

1116
01:36:18,310 --> 01:36:21,929
I'll be there to say goodbye to my friends.
They don't know, but...

1117
01:36:22,022 --> 01:36:24,561
the bus leaves
from downtown at midnight.

1118
01:36:24,650 --> 01:36:26,145
Rowena...

1119
01:36:26,235 --> 01:36:28,442
Rowena...

1120
01:36:28,530 --> 01:36:32,195
When I said that you should go
to New York, I didn't mean right away.

1121
01:36:32,284 --> 01:36:35,368
- You have so much time.
- If I wait, I'll never do it.

1122
01:36:35,454 --> 01:36:40,366
I'll end up waiting tables or working
in some store. It has to be now.

1123
01:36:40,459 --> 01:36:42,998
You could come with me.

1124
01:36:43,087 --> 01:36:45,495
I know you think I'm just a kid.

1125
01:36:46,508 --> 01:36:49,177
- I know you're married with a son.
- Rowena...

1126
01:36:49,261 --> 01:36:51,550
I know.

1127
01:36:51,638 --> 01:36:55,055
don't you see?
You can be writing great music.

1128
01:37:00,315 --> 01:37:03,850
The bus stops at King's drugstore...
tomorrow night.

1129
01:37:22,881 --> 01:37:28,042
(Rowena) ~ Theres a saying old
says that love is blind

1130
01:37:28,554 --> 01:37:33,929
~ Still were often told
```Seek and ye shall find```

1131
01:37:34,436 --> 01:37:45,980
~ So I'm going to seek a certain lad
I`ve had in mind

1132
01:37:46,074 --> 01:37:51,032
~ Looking everywhere,
havent found him yet

1133
01:37:51,997 --> 01:37:57,454
~ Hes the big affair I cannot forget

1134
01:37:58,087 --> 01:38:06,961
~ Only man I ever think of with regret

1135
01:38:08,974 --> 01:38:17,149
~ I'd like to add his initial
to my monogram

1136
01:38:19,194 --> 01:38:32,245
~ Tell me, where is the shepherd
for this lost lamb?

1137
01:38:34,085 --> 01:38:40,171
~ there's a somebody I'm longing to see

1138
01:38:41,051 --> 01:38:44,421
~ I hope that he

1139
01:38:44,597 --> 01:38:48,844
~ Turns out to be

1140
01:38:49,561 --> 01:39:02,031
~ Someone who'll watch over me

1141
01:39:05,412 --> 01:39:11,166
~ I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood

1142
01:39:11,794 --> 01:39:15,543
~ I know I could

1143
01:39:15,715 --> 01:39:20,176
~ Always be good

1144
01:39:20,678 --> 01:39:31,772
~ To one who'll watch over me

1145
01:39:32,275 --> 01:39:37,815
~ Although he may not be the man

1146
01:39:37,906 --> 01:39:42,153
~ Some girls think of as handsome

1147
01:39:42,244 --> 01:39:51,000
~ To my heart he carries the key

1148
01:39:53,423 --> 01:39:59,711
~ Won't you tell him, please,
to put on some speed

1149
01:40:00,139 --> 01:40:03,722
~ Follow my lead?

1150
01:40:04,227 --> 01:40:08,806
~ Oh, how I need

1151
01:40:08,898 --> 01:40:23,706
~ Someone to watch over me

1152
01:40:41,476 --> 01:40:45,889
Listen, some of the kids are having
a party. I should make an appearance.

1153
01:40:46,357 --> 01:40:48,433
Do you want to come?

1154
01:40:48,776 --> 01:40:50,151
Um...

1155
01:40:50,236 --> 01:40:52,312
I should get Cole home.

1156
01:40:53,573 --> 01:40:56,859
OK. Well, I'm not gonna be late. All right?

1157
01:40:57,869 --> 01:40:59,946
OK.

1158
01:41:35,369 --> 01:41:37,279
You pack light.

1159
01:41:58,603 --> 01:42:00,680
You got a place to stay?

1160
01:42:01,690 --> 01:42:03,766
YWCA.

1161
01:42:10,700 --> 01:42:15,908
that's the name of a guy I used to play
in a band with. I've already called him.

1162
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:19,323
He and his wife are expecting you.

1163
01:42:25,466 --> 01:42:27,958
This isn't the way I imagined it.

1164
01:42:31,056 --> 01:42:33,262
But It's the best way.

1165
01:43:36,545 --> 01:43:38,917
Goodbye, Rowena.

1166
01:45:08,272 --> 01:45:10,348
I love you.

1167
01:45:15,488 --> 01:45:17,564
I know.

1168
01:45:31,380 --> 01:45:33,457
(male TVannouncer)
John Lennon is dead.

1169
01:45:33,550 --> 01:45:38,342
(female announcer) New York City.
Residents say a man in his late 30s...

1170
01:45:40,140 --> 01:45:45,348
(female announcer) The guiding spirit
of the Beatles is dead at the age of 40.

1171
01:45:45,897 --> 01:45:49,396
(male radio announcer) The mood
was silence and reverence.

1172
01:45:49,484 --> 01:45:53,529
But as the crowd sang the Beatles songs,
the songs of John Lennon,

1173
01:45:53,613 --> 01:45:56,235
they became happier, vibrant,
more spirited.

1174
01:45:56,325 --> 01:46:00,868
That was the purpose
of John Lennons music, and his life.

1175
01:46:00,955 --> 01:46:02,829
This is Jim Collins reporting.

1176
01:46:32,740 --> 01:46:34,947
What happened to your eye?

1177
01:46:37,245 --> 01:46:39,321
Sorry?

1178
01:46:45,546 --> 01:46:47,337
- Later.
- (clunks spanner)

1179
01:46:52,220 --> 01:46:54,842
In a second!

1180
01:47:01,397 --> 01:47:05,146
Someone was... was killed.

1181
01:47:06,361 --> 01:47:09,611
No, no. Cole. that's not funny.

1182
01:47:21,336 --> 01:47:23,412
John...

1183
01:47:26,049 --> 01:47:27,757
Lennon.

1184
01:47:27,968 --> 01:47:30,044
The musician.

1185
01:47:32,807 --> 01:47:34,883
You wouldn't understand.

1186
01:47:47,740 --> 01:47:49,863
Are you OK? It's so sad.

1187
01:47:56,917 --> 01:47:58,993
Cole, what is it?!

1188
01:48:00,504 --> 01:48:04,253
- He wants to what?
- He wants to tell you something.

1189
01:48:04,341 --> 01:48:07,508
- Couldn't we do this another time?
- Now!

1190
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:15,267
(Iris) "You assume Lennon's death means
nothing to me. Do you think I'm stupid?"

1191
01:48:15,812 --> 01:48:18,386
- "I know who John Lennon is."
- I never said...

1192
01:48:18,899 --> 01:48:21,355
"I can't read your lips
if you don't look at me."

1193
01:48:21,444 --> 01:48:24,149
I never said that you were stupid.

1194
01:48:25,073 --> 01:48:28,857
"You must think so if you think
I don't know who the Beatles are,

1195
01:48:28,952 --> 01:48:31,324
or any music at all."

1196
01:48:31,413 --> 01:48:35,197
"You think I don't care about
what it is that you do, or what you love?"

1197
01:48:35,292 --> 01:48:37,784
"You're my father."

1198
01:48:37,879 --> 01:48:41,959
"I know what music is. You could
help me to know it better, but... no."

1199
01:48:46,930 --> 01:48:50,679
"You care more about teaching
other people than you do about me."

1200
01:48:59,319 --> 01:49:01,395
Iris.

1201
01:49:02,114 --> 01:49:04,190
(clears throat)

1202
01:49:05,492 --> 01:49:07,699
What does this mean?

1203
01:49:07,787 --> 01:49:09,863
That means "asshole".

1204
01:49:31,980 --> 01:49:34,056
Come to bed.

1205
01:49:34,149 --> 01:49:36,225
It's really late.

1206
01:49:37,820 --> 01:49:39,896
I was only tryin' to...

1207
01:49:41,741 --> 01:49:43,817
protect him.

1208
01:49:44,619 --> 01:49:47,110
I just didn't wanna see him hurt...

1209
01:49:48,290 --> 01:49:50,366
or disappointed.

1210
01:49:51,251 --> 01:49:53,328
Hm.

1211
01:50:01,555 --> 01:50:03,631
(engine revs)

1212
01:50:20,534 --> 01:50:24,402
The second would be,
if there are songs with words,

1213
01:50:24,497 --> 01:50:28,791
you will need an interpreter, someone
to sign the words along with the music.

1214
01:50:28,876 --> 01:50:31,284
- We can do two kinds of music.
- Right.

1215
01:50:31,379 --> 01:50:34,464
The first kind would be
the pure music without words.

1216
01:50:34,549 --> 01:50:35,878
The music.

1217
01:50:35,968 --> 01:50:39,419
The pure music without words
that they could experience

1218
01:50:39,513 --> 01:50:43,214
through putting themselves
closer to the language.

1219
01:50:43,309 --> 01:50:45,183
Maybe lights flashing.

1220
01:50:45,311 --> 01:50:47,388
(~ dramatic orchestral music)

1221
01:51:59,810 --> 01:52:02,053
Did you like that?

1222
01:52:02,146 --> 01:52:03,605
OK.

1223
01:52:05,317 --> 01:52:07,475
OK.

1224
01:52:07,569 --> 01:52:12,113
For our final selection tonight, we are
going to do a song by John Lennon.

1225
01:52:12,199 --> 01:52:15,818
Now, to those of you
in our audience who cannot hear,

1226
01:52:16,913 --> 01:52:22,500
you will be grateful for your hearing
difficulties because I am going to sing.

1227
01:52:23,628 --> 01:52:27,543
And to those of you
who have no hearing problems,

1228
01:52:28,676 --> 01:52:31,167
- my profound apologies.
- (laughter)

1229
01:52:34,599 --> 01:52:36,675
Um...

1230
01:52:39,479 --> 01:52:41,556
On a personal note...

1231
01:52:45,111 --> 01:52:50,900
I would like to dedicate this song
to my son...

1232
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:54,236
Cole.

1233
01:53:04,298 --> 01:53:06,256
(~ piano intro)

1234
01:53:06,342 --> 01:53:08,834
~ Close your eyes

1235
01:53:10,430 --> 01:53:12,756
~ Have no fear

1236
01:53:14,226 --> 01:53:16,266
~ The monster's gone

1237
01:53:16,353 --> 01:53:18,097
~ he's on the run

1238
01:53:18,189 --> 01:53:20,894
~ And your daddy's here

1239
01:53:22,652 --> 01:53:25,819
~ Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

1240
01:53:25,906 --> 01:53:29,192
~ Beautiful boy

1241
01:53:29,994 --> 01:53:33,030
~ Before you go to sleep

1242
01:53:34,207 --> 01:53:36,876
~ Say a little prayer

1243
01:53:38,795 --> 01:53:42,164
~ Every day, in every way

1244
01:53:42,257 --> 01:53:45,175
~ It's getting better and better

1245
01:53:47,054 --> 01:53:50,424
~ Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

1246
01:53:50,516 --> 01:53:53,304
~ Beautiful boy

1247
01:53:56,231 --> 01:53:58,936
~ Over the ocean

1248
01:54:00,319 --> 01:54:03,688
~ Sailing away

1249
01:54:03,781 --> 01:54:05,857
~ I can hardly wait

1250
01:54:07,702 --> 01:54:10,276
~ To see you come of age

1251
01:54:11,957 --> 01:54:17,034
~ But I guess we'll both
just have to be patient

1252
01:54:18,923 --> 01:54:22,043
~ Cos It's a long way to go

1253
01:54:23,928 --> 01:54:26,135
~ A hard road to hoe

1254
01:54:27,015 --> 01:54:30,349
~ Yes, It's a long way to go

1255
01:54:30,894 --> 01:54:33,896
~ But in the meantime

1256
01:54:35,232 --> 01:54:38,020
~ Before you cross the street

1257
01:54:39,571 --> 01:54:42,441
~ Please take my hand

1258
01:54:44,034 --> 01:54:51,165
~ Life is what happens to you
while you're busy making other plans

1259
01:54:52,293 --> 01:54:55,627
~ Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

1260
01:54:55,713 --> 01:54:58,881
~ Beautiful boy

1261
01:55:00,844 --> 01:55:04,925
(voice quivers)
~ Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

1262
01:55:06,559 --> 01:55:11,268
~ Beautiful Cole

1263
01:55:32,504 --> 01:55:34,877
~ Well

1264
01:55:34,965 --> 01:55:37,042
~ I got a woman

1265
01:55:37,551 --> 01:55:39,509
~ Way over town

1266
01:55:39,595 --> 01:55:41,672
~ Thats good to me

1267
01:55:42,182 --> 01:55:44,507
~ Oh, yeah

1268
01:55:44,601 --> 01:55:46,677
~ Say, I got a woman

1269
01:55:47,312 --> 01:55:49,389
~ Way over town

1270
01:55:49,898 --> 01:55:52,141
~ Thats good to me

1271
01:55:52,234 --> 01:55:54,274
~ Oh, yeah

1272
01:55:54,362 --> 01:55:56,734
~ She give me money

1273
01:55:56,823 --> 01:55:59,148
~ When Im in need

1274
01:55:59,242 --> 01:56:03,620
~ Yeah, shes a kind old friend indeed

1275
01:56:04,415 --> 01:56:06,740
~ I got a woman

1276
01:56:06,834 --> 01:56:08,910
~ Way over town

1277
01:56:09,003 --> 01:56:11,079
~ Thats good to me

1278
01:56:11,756 --> 01:56:13,713
~ Oh, yeah

1279
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:15,876
~ She said `I love you```

1280
01:56:16,428 --> 01:56:18,800
~ Early in the mornin

1281
01:56:18,889 --> 01:56:21,297
~ Just for me

1282
01:56:21,392 --> 01:56:23,468
~ Oh, yeah

1283
01:56:23,561 --> 01:56:25,767
~ Oh, shes my baby

1284
01:56:25,855 --> 01:56:27,646
~ Dont you understand?

1285
01:56:27,732 --> 01:56:32,560
~ Yeah, and Im her lover man

1286
01:56:33,155 --> 01:56:35,480
~ I got a woman

1287
01:56:35,574 --> 01:56:37,567
~ Way over town

1288
01:56:37,660 --> 01:56:40,032
~ Thats good to me

1289
01:56:40,121 --> 01:56:42,279
~ Oh, yeah

1290
01:56:42,373 --> 01:56:44,532
~ Dont you know, she`s all right

1291
01:56:44,626 --> 01:56:47,497
(~ `Ego Trippin` (Part Two)```
by De La Soul)

1292
01:56:54,887 --> 01:56:57,010
~ Yep, yep, big trucker mans
rollin` in town

1293
01:56:57,098 --> 01:56:58,723
~ How ya do? How ya do?

1294
01:56:58,808 --> 01:57:00,717
- ~ I got the joint to make ya
- ~ Jump

1295
01:57:00,810 --> 01:57:04,725
~ Because I'm headin` eastbound
Tired of the merry-go-round-and-around

1296
01:57:04,815 --> 01:57:08,065
~ You know where Im steppin`
Skirts play with it cos I`m slick like that

1297
01:57:08,152 --> 01:57:10,310
~ Im the greatest MC in the world

1298
01:57:18,622 --> 01:57:21,539
Hey, Joan. He wants to see me?

1299
01:57:22,126 --> 01:57:25,495
- he's with someone.
- Oh. Well, I'll come back later.

1300
01:57:25,588 --> 01:57:27,711
Mr Holland...

1301
01:57:27,798 --> 01:57:29,875
you'd better wait.

1302
01:57:46,820 --> 01:57:49,774
Mr Holland... would you come in, please?

1303
01:58:00,001 --> 01:58:02,788
- what's wrong with Sarah, Gene?
- Please, sit down.

1304
01:58:02,879 --> 01:58:04,955
I'd rather stand, thanks.

1305
01:58:06,133 --> 01:58:08,671
Why is Sarah crying, Gene?

1306
01:58:08,761 --> 01:58:11,845
All right, I'll come right to the point.

1307
01:58:11,931 --> 01:58:16,059
You know how acrimonious
the budget meeting was last Tuesday.

1308
01:58:17,604 --> 01:58:19,976
Be that as it may,

1309
01:58:20,065 --> 01:58:25,226
each school in the district has been asked
to reduce costs by ten per cent -

1310
01:58:25,321 --> 01:58:27,527
by September.

1311
01:58:27,615 --> 01:58:29,821
This is what I've decided.

1312
01:58:41,755 --> 01:58:43,914
The entire music programme.

1313
01:58:44,133 --> 01:58:46,707
And art. And drama.

1314
01:58:46,803 --> 01:58:49,128
Well, congratulations, Gene.

1315
01:58:50,015 --> 01:58:55,175
You've wanted to get rid of me for 30
years. They finally gave you an excuse.

1316
01:58:55,729 --> 01:58:59,562
I'm not as popular as you.
I'm not anybody's favourite anything.

1317
01:58:59,650 --> 01:59:04,776
- that's because you're the enemy, Gene.
- I care about these kids as much as you.

1318
01:59:05,031 --> 01:59:09,907
If I'm forced to choose between Mozart
and reading and writing and long division,

1319
01:59:09,995 --> 01:59:12,320
I choose long division.

1320
01:59:15,459 --> 01:59:19,540
Well, I guess you can cut the arts
as much as you want, Gene.

1321
01:59:19,631 --> 01:59:24,340
Sooner or later these kids aren't gonna
have anything to read or write about.

1322
01:59:27,014 --> 01:59:29,256
Mr Holland?

1323
01:59:30,851 --> 01:59:33,307
If there's anything I can do...

1324
01:59:33,396 --> 01:59:35,768
A recommendation?

1325
01:59:35,857 --> 01:59:37,980
I'm 60 years old, Gene.

1326
01:59:38,068 --> 01:59:42,018
What are you gonna do, write me
a recommendation for the morgue?

1327
01:59:46,661 --> 01:59:50,030
- Jacobs would have fought this.
- She would have lost.

1328
01:59:50,123 --> 01:59:54,619
Yes, she would have lost, but she
would have fought this, and so will I!

1329
01:59:57,506 --> 02:00:02,583
No, no, do not misunderstand me.
I am not talking about my job.

1330
02:00:02,678 --> 02:00:07,091
I am talking about the education
that students once got at Kennedy High

1331
02:00:07,183 --> 02:00:10,932
versus the education that
you are willing to give these kids today.

1332
02:00:11,021 --> 02:00:14,473
We have been going
over and over this, Mr Holland.

1333
02:00:14,566 --> 02:00:17,437
- We've done all we can.
- Then do it again.

1334
02:00:18,362 --> 02:00:22,147
that's what I said when you were
my student, Michael. It served you well.

1335
02:00:22,242 --> 02:00:25,445
- That was a different time, Mr Holland.
- I don't think so.

1336
02:00:25,537 --> 02:00:28,324
- I think that more was expected of us.
- 15 seconds.

1337
02:00:28,415 --> 02:00:31,203
The big difference
is how little you people care.

1338
02:00:31,293 --> 02:00:35,042
- And how lazy you've become.
- I resent your tone, Mr Holland.

1339
02:00:35,131 --> 02:00:38,880
I don't think you have any appreciation
for our financial problems.

1340
02:00:38,968 --> 02:00:40,926
Come on, Michael!

1341
02:00:41,012 --> 02:00:45,924
The big problem here is that you are
willing to create a generation of children

1342
02:00:46,018 --> 02:00:49,304
who will not have the ability
to think, create, listen...

1343
02:00:49,397 --> 02:00:50,511
Time, Mr Holland.

1344
02:00:50,606 --> 02:00:54,735
(Michael) Mr Holland, as I've said,
We've done the best that we can.

1345
02:00:54,819 --> 02:00:57,489
Your best is not good enough!

1346
02:01:06,791 --> 02:01:09,329
"A very flattering offer
has been made to me

1347
02:01:09,419 --> 02:01:14,710
to teach at a university for the deaf
in Washington DC"!

1348
02:01:16,343 --> 02:01:19,380
"I'm not sure that I'm going to take it

1349
02:01:19,472 --> 02:01:24,264
because I'm fond of the students
in the school that I'm at now."

1350
02:01:25,145 --> 02:01:27,303
"It's something to think about."

1351
02:01:28,064 --> 02:01:31,813
"No girlfriends yet.
At least, not serious ones."

1352
02:01:32,277 --> 02:01:37,189
"And tell Dad that I'm never
going to give his car back."

1353
02:01:38,368 --> 02:01:40,775
"Love always, Cole."

1354
02:02:36,891 --> 02:02:38,967
(Meister) Hey.

1355
02:02:40,436 --> 02:02:42,512
Hey.

1356
02:02:43,356 --> 02:02:45,515
What are you doin' here?

1357
02:02:45,609 --> 02:02:49,903
I had some jockstraps in the rinse cycle
down in the locker room(!)

1358
02:02:52,283 --> 02:02:54,655
I came to see if you needed any help.

1359
02:02:54,744 --> 02:02:56,618
Nope.

1360
02:02:56,704 --> 02:02:58,781
No, no, no.

1361
02:02:59,499 --> 02:03:02,417
So, you decided
what you're gonna do yet?

1362
02:03:02,502 --> 02:03:04,579
Too old to start a rock band.

1363
02:03:06,340 --> 02:03:10,718
Probably hang out a shingle
and teach a few piano lessons.

1364
02:03:12,430 --> 02:03:15,930
- I'd love to retire...
- I'm not retiring, Bill.

1365
02:03:16,017 --> 02:03:18,094
I'm getting dumped.

1366
02:03:19,897 --> 02:03:23,313
And I don't think
you have anything to worry about.

1367
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:26,734
The day they cut the football budget
in this state, well, now,

1368
02:03:26,821 --> 02:03:30,522
that will be the end
of Western civilisation as we know it.

1369
02:03:34,079 --> 02:03:36,155
I'll tell you the truth.

1370
02:03:38,626 --> 02:03:40,998
I'm scared to death.

1371
02:03:41,087 --> 02:03:44,622
- They're gonna miss you around here.
- You really think so?

1372
02:03:44,716 --> 02:03:48,465
- What, do you doubt it?
- Well, as a matter of fact, yeah.

1373
02:03:49,513 --> 02:03:54,508
It's almost funny - I got dragged into
this gig kicking and screaming,

1374
02:03:54,602 --> 02:03:57,473
and now It's the only thing
I wanna do, and...

1375
02:04:00,900 --> 02:04:02,977
You work your whole life...

1376
02:04:05,280 --> 02:04:10,073
you work for 30 years because you think
that what you do makes a difference.

1377
02:04:11,037 --> 02:04:13,113
You think it matters to people.

1378
02:04:14,332 --> 02:04:17,582
And then you wake up one morning
and you find out, well, no,

1379
02:04:17,669 --> 02:04:21,085
you've made a little error there.

1380
02:04:21,173 --> 02:04:25,634
You are... expendable.

1381
02:04:30,475 --> 02:04:33,595
Oh, God. (chuckles)

1382
02:04:35,021 --> 02:04:37,098
Oh, I should be laughing.

1383
02:04:40,945 --> 02:04:43,566
You're sure you don't need any help, huh?

1384
02:04:45,992 --> 02:04:48,068
All right.

1385
02:05:00,049 --> 02:05:02,125
(car horn beeps repeatedly)

1386
02:05:15,399 --> 02:05:17,226
Dad!

1387
02:05:18,444 --> 02:05:20,936
What are you doing here?!

1388
02:05:21,031 --> 02:05:23,818
School is out for me too.

1389
02:05:23,909 --> 02:05:26,447
The old car... it looks pretty good.

1390
02:05:27,079 --> 02:05:30,246
It's a classic. You can't have it back!

1391
02:05:38,592 --> 02:05:42,424
No! No... you don't have to do this.

1392
02:05:42,513 --> 02:05:45,431
I don't want an old fart like you
to strain yourself.

1393
02:05:45,516 --> 02:05:47,675
OK, OK... asshole.

1394
02:05:51,356 --> 02:05:53,479
that's enough, you two.

1395
02:05:53,567 --> 02:05:55,643
Let's go out to the car.

1396
02:06:31,025 --> 02:06:33,101
(~ piano)

1397
02:06:35,405 --> 02:06:37,481
Now, what is that?

1398
02:06:37,574 --> 02:06:39,650
Um... I don't know.

1399
02:06:40,243 --> 02:06:44,870
- You can't hear what's going on in there?
- Oh, yeah. I... I hear it, but...

1400
02:06:44,957 --> 02:06:47,709
there's something going on in there.

1401
02:06:47,793 --> 02:06:53,037
- It could be a summer programme.
- They don't start for another two weeks.

1402
02:06:53,466 --> 02:06:55,708
(~ students sing `Louie, Louie```)

1403
02:07:51,197 --> 02:07:54,862
- Mr Stadler?
- I wouldn't have missed it, Mr Holland.

1404
02:08:20,104 --> 02:08:22,180
Hi!

1405
02:08:41,127 --> 02:08:43,203
Uh... I'll sign myself.

1406
02:08:48,552 --> 02:08:50,878
Uh, hello. Um... (clears throat)

1407
02:08:51,973 --> 02:08:55,840
Our master of ceremonies
seems to be a little late,

1408
02:08:56,352 --> 02:08:59,223
so I guess It's up to me to begin.

1409
02:09:00,107 --> 02:09:03,807
When word first got out
that the music programme was cut,

1410
02:09:03,902 --> 02:09:07,188
and about the retirement of my husband,

1411
02:09:08,115 --> 02:09:13,620
well, I've never seen such a response
from the community.

1412
02:09:14,664 --> 02:09:17,582
Oh! Looks like my watch is fast.

1413
02:09:17,668 --> 02:09:21,618
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
may I present our governor

1414
02:09:21,714 --> 02:09:24,466
and Kennedy High School alumnus,

1415
02:09:24,550 --> 02:09:28,002
the most honourable Gertrude Lang.

1416
02:09:31,933 --> 02:09:34,010
Gertrude.

1417
02:09:34,937 --> 02:09:37,309
It's been a long time.

1418
02:09:47,409 --> 02:09:50,529
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Oh... thank you.

1419
02:10:00,799 --> 02:10:03,420
My... my apologies for my tardiness.

1420
02:10:03,510 --> 02:10:08,505
Principal Wolters, I'd like you to know,
yes, I brought a note from my mother!

1421
02:10:13,021 --> 02:10:17,398
Mr Holland had
a profound influence on my life -

1422
02:10:17,484 --> 02:10:19,607
on a lot of lives I know.

1423
02:10:20,153 --> 02:10:26,027
And yet I get the feeling that he considers
a great part of his own life misspent.

1424
02:10:27,787 --> 02:10:30,872
Rumour had it he was always
working on his symphony,

1425
02:10:30,957 --> 02:10:33,828
and this was gonna
make him famous, rich -

1426
02:10:33,919 --> 02:10:36,244
probably both.

1427
02:10:36,338 --> 02:10:41,581
But Mr Holland isn't rich,
and... he isn't famous.

1428
02:10:41,677 --> 02:10:44,299
At least, not outside of our little town.

1429
02:10:44,973 --> 02:10:48,805
So it might be easy for him
to think himself a failure.

1430
02:10:50,354 --> 02:10:52,430
And he would be wrong.

1431
02:10:53,440 --> 02:10:57,735
Because I think he's achieved a success
far beyond riches and fame.

1432
02:10:59,656 --> 02:11:01,779
Look around you.

1433
02:11:01,866 --> 02:11:05,651
There is not a life in this room
that you have not touched.

1434
02:11:06,580 --> 02:11:11,159
(voice quivers) And... each one of us
is a better person because of you.

1435
02:11:12,128 --> 02:11:15,295
We are your symphony, Mr Holland.

1436
02:11:15,381 --> 02:11:18,964
We are the melodies
and the notes of your opus,

1437
02:11:19,052 --> 02:11:21,839
and we are the music of your life.

1438
02:11:45,748 --> 02:11:49,449
Mr Holland, we would now like
to give something back to you.

1439
02:11:50,253 --> 02:11:52,923
To you and to your wife,
who, along with you,

1440
02:11:53,006 --> 02:11:56,376
has waited 30 years
for what we are about to hear.

1441
02:11:57,303 --> 02:12:02,131
If you will, would you please
come up here and take this baton...

1442
02:12:02,809 --> 02:12:06,724
and lead us in the first performance ever

1443
02:12:06,813 --> 02:12:09,933
of "The American Symphony"
by Glenn Holland.

1444

(~ `Cole`s Song``` by Julian Lennon)

1445
02:16:46,957 --> 02:16:49,033
~ I feel

1446
02:16:50,210 --> 02:16:53,627
~ That the love around me

1447
02:16:55,883 --> 02:17:02,800
~ Has come from another world

1448
02:17:04,184 --> 02:17:07,553
~ I have lost love

1449
02:17:08,606 --> 02:17:11,809
~ I have found love

1450
02:17:13,569 --> 02:17:20,071
~ From the moment you were born

1451
02:17:22,538 --> 02:17:29,371
~ I could see a new beginning

1452
02:17:31,172 --> 02:17:33,498
~ Come to me

1453
02:17:34,760 --> 02:17:38,211
~ Let me tell you how

1454
02:17:39,723 --> 02:17:43,009
~ How Ive lost love

1455
02:17:44,145 --> 02:17:47,395
~ And how Ive found love

1456
02:17:49,234 --> 02:17:56,281
~ In a world of broken dreams

1457
02:17:58,077 --> 02:18:05,575
~ I was wrong to deny your feelings

1458
02:18:07,004 --> 02:18:14,881
~ And I'm sorry if I`ve caused you pain

1459
02:18:15,430 --> 02:18:18,633
~ I was lost then

1460
02:18:19,643 --> 02:18:22,928
~ So confused then

1461
02:18:24,106 --> 02:18:32,482
~ And I believe that
you would change that

1462
02:18:33,199 --> 02:18:40,199
~ There are broken hearts we can mend

1463
02:18:42,126 --> 02:18:50,881
~ Through the music
weve learned to love again

1464
02:18:50,969 --> 02:18:54,255
~ Through the sad notes

1465
02:18:55,307 --> 02:18:58,511
~ Through the years

1466
02:19:00,479 --> 02:19:07,017
~ From the moment you were born

1467
02:19:08,780 --> 02:19:11,984
~ I have lost you

1468
02:19:13,285 --> 02:19:16,370
~ Now Ive found you

1469
02:19:18,249 --> 02:19:22,413
~ Let me feel your heart

1470
02:19:22,796 --> 02:19:24,872
~ Let me hear

1471
02:19:27,676 --> 02:19:32,137

~ Trying to embrace

1475
02:20:13,811 --> 02:20:17,097
~ Life with my heart

1476
02:20:17,189 --> 02:20:23,145
~ By all the beauty I feel and create

1477
02:20:24,948 --> 02:20:29,776
~ It spins and moves

1478
02:20:30,663 --> 02:20:35,325
~ Flows at my pace

1479
02:20:36,210 --> 02:20:46,711
~ Telling its story
from the tear running down my face

1480
02:20:46,805 --> 02:20:51,468
~ Visions of a sunset

1481
02:20:51,561 --> 02:20:57,101
~ Just appear when I close my eyes

1482
02:20:57,192 --> 02:21:02,982
~ Takes me closer to heaven

1483
02:21:03,073 --> 02:21:12,031
~ When the flute starts to fly
and the violin cries

- ~ It's all I need in my life

~ It's all I need, and no one...

1486
02:21:25,265 --> 02:21:33,439
~ Can take your place by my side

1487
02:21:34,692 --> 02:21:36,981
~ You're all inside of me

1488

~ Takes me closer to heaven

~ When the flute starts to fly
and the violin cries

1492
02:21:58,468 --> 02:22:04,056
~ I will flee from all sorrow

1493
02:22:04,141 --> 02:22:09,728
~ Like the wind blows from the sky

1494

~ Takes me closer to heaven

1495
