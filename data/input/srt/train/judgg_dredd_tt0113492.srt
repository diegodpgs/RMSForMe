1
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:54,526
Aspen Prison shuttle docked.

2
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:58,448
Parolees prepare to disembark.

3
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,459
Ferguson, Herman.

4
00:03:13,798 --> 00:03:15,465
Six months sentence,
Aspen Prison served.

5
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:16,759
Welcome back, citizen.

6
00:03:16,801 --> 00:03:18,803
Your living assignment is...

7
00:03:19,305 --> 00:03:20,846
"Y"-Block, Heavenly Haven.

8
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,850
Red quad. Move on. Come on.

9
00:03:51,214 --> 00:03:53,340
Welcome home.

10
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,540
That's it!

11
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,960
- I think that's Heavenly Haven.
- In your dreams, buddy.

12
00:05:05,044 --> 00:05:06,669
Yeah, Heavenly...

13
00:05:08,422 --> 00:05:10,507
Starting descent to Sector 12,

14
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:11,758
Yellow District.

15
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:13,719
Nine-hundred feet.

16
00:05:13,761 --> 00:05:15,513
Seven-hundred feet.

17
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:18,265
Four-hundred feet.

18
00:05:18,308 --> 00:05:21,894
Take caution in this sector.
There is a citizen riot in progress.

19
00:05:21,937 --> 00:05:23,938
Have a nice day.

20
00:05:56,308 --> 00:05:57,767
It's better than prison.

21
00:05:58,936 --> 00:06:00,686
Jesus Christ!

22
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:05,317
Eat recycled food
for a happier, healthier life.

23
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,278
Be kind and peaceful to each other.

24
00:06:08,321 --> 00:06:10,656
Eat recycled food.

25
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,323
Recycled food.

26
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:15,328
It's good for the environment
and okay for you.

27
00:06:22,794 --> 00:06:23,878
Hey, look what I got!

28
00:06:25,215 --> 00:06:26,757
Little cupcake.

29
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,134
What have we got here?

30
00:06:30,637 --> 00:06:32,262
Are you a Judge spy, little man?

31
00:06:32,346 --> 00:06:36,351
Me, a spy?
This guy is funny.

32
00:06:36,394 --> 00:06:38,769
No, no, no. I live here.

33
00:06:38,853 --> 00:06:43,524
I mean, I'm gonna live here, if I live.
Maybe I should go to a hotel?

34
00:06:43,566 --> 00:06:46,529
No way, man!
Don't you hear 'em out there?

35
00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:48,697
It's block war, man!

36
00:06:53,828 --> 00:06:55,956
- Block war.
- Yeah.

37
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:24,986
Just like an Academy simulation
right down to the cross fire.

38
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,948
- I'll lead off. You follow.
- This is no sim, rookie!

39
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:30,409
We'll stand down and wait for backup.

40
00:07:31,745 --> 00:07:35,080
Hershey and Brisco in position
outside Heavenly Haven!

41
00:07:35,123 --> 00:07:38,167
We're under fire from the upper floors.
Request backup.

42
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:41,254
Cell "B" in Heavenly Haven,
on the corner of Abbott and Costello.

43
00:07:41,297 --> 00:07:42,838
Request backup.

44
00:08:21,006 --> 00:08:22,299
Holy crud!

45
00:08:22,384 --> 00:08:24,133
He's a sitting duck out there.

46
00:08:24,218 --> 00:08:25,843
He knows what he's doing.

47
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,560
I am the Law!

48
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:37,982
Drop your weapons!

49
00:08:39,193 --> 00:08:43,613
These blocks are under arrest!

50
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:49,203
This is your final warning!

51
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:50,913
That's Judge Dredd, man!

52
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,165
Hey! You wanna be afraid
of somebody?

53
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,458
Be afraid of me!

54
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:56,836
I got it!

55
00:08:56,878 --> 00:08:59,297
Why don't I run down there
and surrender?

56
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,799
Sort of throw 'em off guard!

57
00:09:02,427 --> 00:09:03,468
Bad idea.

58
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,847
Hey, Dredd! Come and get us!

59
00:09:11,687 --> 00:09:13,604
I knew they'd do that.

60
00:09:13,689 --> 00:09:15,106
Judge Dredd, take cover!

61
00:09:15,774 --> 00:09:20,529
They're firing.20 millimeter caseless
flechette rounds at 300 meters.

62
00:09:20,572 --> 00:09:24,323
The effective lethal range
is 200 meters.

63
00:09:24,366 --> 00:09:26,118
You're safe.

64
00:09:26,536 --> 00:09:28,954
What are you doing down there,
Judge Hershey?

65
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:32,000
Waiting for backup.

66
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,671
It's here.

67
00:09:36,714 --> 00:09:39,840
Let's move it out.
Keep it simple. Single file.

68
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:43,721
Standard relay. I'm point. You're last.

69
00:09:46,515 --> 00:09:48,684
- Grenade.
- Grenade.

70
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,357
- Nice shot, sir!
- You two meet me on the 40th.

71
00:09:55,817 --> 00:09:57,694
Hey, you need to get some more ammo!

72
00:09:57,737 --> 00:10:02,532
Be kind and peaceful to each other.
Eat recycled food.

73
00:10:03,327 --> 00:10:04,993
Hey, you guys with us?

74
00:10:05,077 --> 00:10:06,953
Yeah! All right!

75
00:10:07,038 --> 00:10:09,165
Let's rock 'n' roll!

76
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:20,384
Dredd!

77
00:10:25,934 --> 00:10:28,060
This room has been pacified.

78
00:10:28,102 --> 00:10:29,603
Next one's mine!

79
00:10:29,647 --> 00:10:31,855
No! Rookie, hold on!

80
00:10:31,941 --> 00:10:33,650
This room is under arrest!

81
00:10:35,194 --> 00:10:36,361
No!

82
00:10:36,445 --> 00:10:38,530
Die, Judges! Die!

83
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:42,743
You're under arrest.

84
00:10:42,786 --> 00:10:45,955
Throw down your weapons,
and prepare to be judged!

85
00:10:46,122 --> 00:10:48,457
Judge this, Lawgiver man!

86
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,085
- No, don't! They're booby-trapped.
- Intruder.

87
00:10:54,465 --> 00:10:55,673
Holy drok!

88
00:10:55,757 --> 00:10:58,802
Full auto. Rapid-fire.

89
00:10:58,844 --> 00:11:00,803
Rapid-fire.

90
00:11:07,103 --> 00:11:09,939
- Armor piercing.
- Armor piercing.

91
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,150
Drop dead, Dredd!

92
00:11:14,862 --> 00:11:18,574
- Double whammy.
- Double whammy.

93
00:11:24,832 --> 00:11:27,332
Mega City municipal code 213,

94
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:30,419
willful destruction of property.
That's two years.

95
00:11:30,503 --> 00:11:33,714
Code 310, illegal possession
of assault weapons, five years.

96
00:11:33,798 --> 00:11:37,844
Code 457, resisting arrest, 20 years!

97
00:11:40,681 --> 00:11:41,973
Thank you, Hershey.

98
00:11:44,687 --> 00:11:47,313
And code 3613,

99
00:11:47,355 --> 00:11:51,692
the first degree murder
of a Street Judge.

100
00:11:51,735 --> 00:11:54,486
Let me guess. Life.

101
00:11:58,034 --> 00:11:59,618
Death.

102
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:05,541
Court's adjourned.

103
00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:09,295
Violence struck again in
Mega City tonight, taking a deadly toll.

104
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:13,424
Fifty-three hospitalized,
five of them children. Nineteen dead.

105
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,719
You got him?

106
00:12:15,927 --> 00:12:18,930
Bring him up. Okay. Now, just turn...
The other way. You got him?

107
00:12:19,932 --> 00:12:21,223
Damn it!

108
00:12:22,435 --> 00:12:24,394
I was supposed to be
watching out for him.

109
00:12:24,437 --> 00:12:27,565
Don't blame yourself, Hershey.
He made the mistake, not you.

110
00:12:29,943 --> 00:12:32,737
Wouldn't it feel good to have
an emotion once in a while, huh?

111
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,072
Emotions.

112
00:12:35,115 --> 00:12:37,075
There ought to be a law against them.

113
00:12:37,117 --> 00:12:40,746
- Eat recycled food.
- Halt!

114
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,916
It's good for the environment,
and okay for you.

115
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,336
Please make your selection.
Insert your credit in the slot.

116
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,924
- You have five seconds to surrender!
- Dredd, it's just a servo-droid.

117
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:52,549
- The servo-droid is your friend.
- Five.

118
00:12:52,592 --> 00:12:54,051
- Please let your friend go by.
- Four.

119
00:12:54,094 --> 00:12:57,806
- Three. Two.
- You are in the way of the servo-droid.

120
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:01,434
- One!
- Boy, am I glad to see you!

121
00:13:02,645 --> 00:13:04,688
Mega City code 7592,

122
00:13:04,772 --> 00:13:07,441
willful sabotage of a public droid.
That's six months, citizen.

123
00:13:07,526 --> 00:13:10,111
Let's see your Unicard.

124
00:13:10,153 --> 00:13:13,948
Come on, give me a break,
Judge Dredd. Dredd?

125
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,494
- God!
- Ferguson, Herman. Hacker.

126
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:21,082
Illegal tampering with city droids,
computers, cash machines, taxi robots.

127
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,041
And you haven't even
been out ofjail for 24 hours.

128
00:13:23,126 --> 00:13:25,544
He's habitual, Hershey.
Automatic five-year sentence.

129
00:13:25,628 --> 00:13:27,964
- How do you plead?
- Not guilty?

130
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,133
I knew you'd say that.

131
00:13:30,175 --> 00:13:34,137
Five years? No! No! I had no choice.

132
00:13:34,221 --> 00:13:36,681
- They were killing each other.
- You could've gone out the window.

133
00:13:36,764 --> 00:13:38,726
Forty floors? It would've been suicide.

134
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,145
Maybe, but it's legal.

135
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:42,688
Judges?

136
00:13:42,772 --> 00:13:43,856
- Yes, sir?
- What?

137
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,650
Five years. Aspen Penitentiary.
Case closed. Take him away.

138
00:13:46,735 --> 00:13:51,364
Don't close the case.
You're misjudging me! Open the case!

139
00:13:51,741 --> 00:13:53,867
You're not going to be able
to sleep tonight.

140
00:13:53,951 --> 00:13:55,910
He might've been telling
the truth, you know.

141
00:13:56,454 --> 00:13:58,328
Haven't you ever heard
of extenuating circumstances?

142
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:01,125
I've heard it all, Hershey.

143
00:14:02,835 --> 00:14:04,503
I knew you'd say that.

144
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:14,180
My fellow Judges,
have we forgotten the lessons of history?

145
00:14:14,222 --> 00:14:17,516
However quickly these
block wars can be contained,

146
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:20,563
it's clear that
they're becoming an epidemic,

147
00:14:20,647 --> 00:14:24,733
an epidemic that should
be dealt with immediately.

148
00:14:25,652 --> 00:14:28,403
The only solution
is a tougher criminal code.

149
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,366
Our situation gets worse every day.

150
00:14:31,409 --> 00:14:34,202
Seventy-three citizen riots
in 16 different sectors

151
00:14:34,286 --> 00:14:35,703
in the last two months alone.

152
00:14:35,746 --> 00:14:39,749
Violent crime is rising
at 15% every quarter.

153
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:42,045
If we don't increase our resources,

154
00:14:42,087 --> 00:14:44,797
they will be inadequate
in less than three years.

155
00:14:44,881 --> 00:14:47,467
Three years?
Our resources are inadequate now!

156
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,551
My fellow Council members,

157
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:52,931
as a city we continue to grow,

158
00:14:53,015 --> 00:14:55,225
and growth is painful.

159
00:14:55,309 --> 00:15:01,232
Sixty-five million people living in
an area designed for no more than 20!

160
00:15:01,274 --> 00:15:06,195
It's not enough that they rely on us
for food, clothes, water, clean air...

161
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,740
Chief Justice, the city is in chaos!

162
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:12,910
For social order, we need tighter reins.

163
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,372
Incarceration hasn't worked
as a deterrent.

164
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:19,626
I say we expand execution
to include lesser crimes!

165
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,463
My fellow Judges,

166
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:27,802
I was barely in my teens
when I put on this badge.

167
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:30,304
When the time comes for me
to take it off,

168
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:35,310
please let me do so knowing that
it still stands for freedom,

169
00:15:35,395 --> 00:15:38,938
and not for repression.

170
00:15:40,108 --> 00:15:41,817
Fifty-three hospitalized.

171
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:45,446
Nineteen dead, four of them
killed by a gang of squatters

172
00:15:45,489 --> 00:15:48,866
who were themselves killed in
summary executions by Judge Dredd.

173
00:15:50,285 --> 00:15:52,705
As my special undercover
report continues,

174
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:55,874
I will take you behind the
scenes at the Halls of Justice

175
00:15:55,958 --> 00:16:00,545
for a disturbing probe into
these recent riots and block wars.

176
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,424
Coincidence or deliberate?

177
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,967
Dredd!

178
00:16:06,094 --> 00:16:08,512
Some people think working these mean streets

179
00:16:08,597 --> 00:16:10,514
has a dehumanizing effect on...

180
00:16:19,817 --> 00:16:22,819
- Joseph.
- Chief Justice Fargo.

181
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:26,115
You may stand at ease, Joseph.

182
00:16:35,001 --> 00:16:36,084
So, tell me.

183
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:40,714
Seven summary executions.
Were they necessary?

184
00:16:41,424 --> 00:16:42,716
Unavoidable, sir.

185
00:16:43,676 --> 00:16:44,969
Unavoidable.

186
00:16:45,012 --> 00:16:47,388
Life doesn't mean much
to some people anymore.

187
00:16:48,223 --> 00:16:52,352
- You'd see that if you weren't always...
- lf I weren't what?

188
00:16:52,394 --> 00:16:54,019
Always at the Academy, sir.

189
00:16:54,688 --> 00:17:00,945
Oh! Don't you mean,
at the Academy wiping cadets' asses?

190
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,447
That's what they say
in the squad room, isn't it?

191
00:17:03,531 --> 00:17:06,534
It's irrelevant. You set the standard, sir.

192
00:17:06,577 --> 00:17:10,663
Now you do,
at least to many young cadets.

193
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,707
You're a legend.

194
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,918
Sir.

195
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:17,797
You remember your days
as a cadet, Joseph?

196
00:17:18,131 --> 00:17:20,090
I remember what you taught me, sir.

197
00:17:21,258 --> 00:17:23,636
You were my finest student.

198
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:26,973
So, I've drawn
a new assignment for you.

199
00:17:27,057 --> 00:17:28,183
Starting tomorrow,

200
00:17:28,226 --> 00:17:31,060
you're going to spend
two days a week at the Academy.

201
00:17:31,144 --> 00:17:34,106
I'd be honored, sir.
Unarmed combat or marksmanship?

202
00:17:35,065 --> 00:17:36,233
Ethics.

203
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,600
Wait here.

204
00:18:13,858 --> 00:18:16,359
Remain still. Identify yourself.

205
00:18:16,444 --> 00:18:18,779
Miller. Warden.

206
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:22,324
Voice sample recognized.
Thank you, Warden. System disarmed.

207
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,243
Why are you here?

208
00:18:25,286 --> 00:18:27,622
Did you come for another chat?

209
00:18:27,665 --> 00:18:30,958
Just a short one, I'm afraid. Duty calls.

210
00:18:31,001 --> 00:18:33,003
Ah, duty!

211
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:38,384
Feeding these parasites here
at the public's expense?

212
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,969
Yeah.

213
00:18:41,012 --> 00:18:42,638
You especially!

214
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,474
I don't cost anything.

215
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:48,645
I'm a ghost.

216
00:18:49,481 --> 00:18:52,315
And we're both prisoners here.

217
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:56,736
You're behind your desk,
and I'm behind this.

218
00:18:58,156 --> 00:19:02,201
What a clever reward from Fargo, huh?

219
00:19:02,285 --> 00:19:03,995
I mean, considering the services.

220
00:19:04,997 --> 00:19:08,834
When you started killing
innocent people, Rico,

221
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:11,252
you went beyond service.

222
00:19:11,337 --> 00:19:15,508
The innocent exist only until they
inevitably become perpetrators,

223
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:17,634
like you.

224
00:19:19,054 --> 00:19:22,515
Guilt and innocence

225
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:24,683
is a matter of timing.

226
00:19:24,726 --> 00:19:26,352
Your...

227
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:29,731
Our mysterious benefactor

228
00:19:31,192 --> 00:19:33,110
has sent you a package.

229
00:19:37,198 --> 00:19:41,119
Deactivate shield. Autoguns only.

230
00:19:41,203 --> 00:19:44,038
Autoguns reactivated, Warden Miller.

231
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,588
Hmm.

232
00:19:51,673 --> 00:19:56,259
- What is that?
- It's an ancient puzzle,

233
00:19:56,343 --> 00:19:58,554
that contains the meaning of life.

234
00:20:05,396 --> 00:20:07,062
So, tell me, Rico,

235
00:20:08,649 --> 00:20:10,233
what is the meaning of life?

236
00:20:13,238 --> 00:20:14,572
It ends.

237
00:20:18,827 --> 00:20:21,246
Stop! Computer!

238
00:20:21,413 --> 00:20:24,708
Activate alarm!

239
00:20:25,418 --> 00:20:29,087
Voice not recognized.
Guns are training.

240
00:20:29,172 --> 00:20:30,338
Remain still.

241
00:20:35,762 --> 00:20:39,472
Security, override and unlock!
Come on!

242
00:20:59,495 --> 00:21:03,708
Kevlar 9 helmet and body armor.
Yours when you graduate.

243
00:21:07,296 --> 00:21:08,463
Lawgiver 2.

244
00:21:08,547 --> 00:21:10,215
Twenty-five-round side arm

245
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:13,135
with mission-variable
voice-programmed ammunition.

246
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,304
- Signal flare.
- Flare.

247
00:21:18,308 --> 00:21:21,268
Yours if you graduate.

248
00:21:22,687 --> 00:21:25,065
Mark 4 Lawmaster, improved model,

249
00:21:25,149 --> 00:21:27,066
with dual on-board laser cannons,

250
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,319
vertical take-off
and landing flight capability.

251
00:21:29,362 --> 00:21:31,446
Range, 500 kilometers.

252
00:21:32,447 --> 00:21:34,992
- Men.
- Yes, sir.

253
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:37,494
Active.

254
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,789
Malfunction. Malfunction.

255
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:42,083
Malfunction.

256
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,500
Hmm?

257
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,050
Yours if you can ever get it to work.

258
00:21:53,136 --> 00:21:56,516
All of these things
you see here are toys.

259
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,687
At the end of the day
when you're all alone in the dark,

260
00:22:00,771 --> 00:22:06,485
the only thing that counts
is this, the Law.

261
00:22:08,028 --> 00:22:12,657
And you will be alone
when you swear to uphold these ideals.

262
00:22:13,993 --> 00:22:17,205
For most of us,
there's only death in the streets.

263
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:19,832
For the few of us that survive to old age,

264
00:22:19,874 --> 00:22:24,044
the proud loneliness of the Long Walk.

265
00:22:24,129 --> 00:22:27,133
A walk that every Judge must take

266
00:22:27,217 --> 00:22:29,634
outside these city walls

267
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:32,305
into the unknown of the Cursed Earth.

268
00:22:32,805 --> 00:22:36,142
And there spend
your last remaining days

269
00:22:36,893 --> 00:22:40,229
taking law to the lawless.

270
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,817
This is what it means to be a Judge.

271
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:49,197
This is the commitment I expect.

272
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:52,909
Class dismissed.

273
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,289
Attention, all personnel.

274
00:22:56,373 --> 00:22:58,790
Due to the recent disturbance
in Heavenly Haven,

275
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:02,920
there will be increased patrols
in Sector 4.

276
00:23:03,005 --> 00:23:06,383
Please check with your commanders
to see if you are affected

277
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,593
by these scheduled changes.

278
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,513
I can hear you thinking.

279
00:23:13,474 --> 00:23:15,434
I caught your lecture today.

280
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,937
Is that really what you
think the cadets need to hear?

281
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:21,941
- What I told them is the truth.
- Your truth maybe.

282
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:24,443
You made it sound like our lives
are practically over.

283
00:23:24,527 --> 00:23:27,448
Don't you think parts are, Hershey?

284
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:30,075
I have a personal life. I have friends.

285
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,036
You're one of the smartest
of the new breed,

286
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:34,079
but you've only been
on the street a year.

287
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,667
You haven't gotten used
to the isolation yet.

288
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:43,173
No. No, I don't think that's right.

289
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:46,092
No one is supposed
to be alone all the time.

290
00:23:47,178 --> 00:23:50,514
I mean, is that really what
it's been like for you?

291
00:23:50,598 --> 00:23:54,476
Don't you ever...
Haven't you ever had a friend?

292
00:23:56,145 --> 00:23:58,689
Yes. Once.

293
00:23:59,483 --> 00:24:00,525
What happened?

294
00:24:04,988 --> 00:24:06,531
Dredd, wait.

295
00:24:07,366 --> 00:24:09,326
I want to know. What happened?

296
00:24:11,496 --> 00:24:12,704
I judged him.

297
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,176
Aspen shuttle has completed off-Ioading.

298
00:24:25,261 --> 00:24:27,345
Cargo and morgue shipments
from Aspen.

299
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,680
Okay.

300
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,560
Let's get outta here.

301
00:25:05,387 --> 00:25:09,183
Get your nose filters!
Get your nose filters!

302
00:25:11,144 --> 00:25:14,522
Please select your fantasy now
and enjoy.

303
00:25:14,564 --> 00:25:17,232
...who were themselves killed

304
00:25:17,317 --> 00:25:20,444
in summary executions
by Judge Dredd.

305
00:25:20,528 --> 00:25:22,655
As my special
undercover report continues,

306
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,242
I will take you behind the scenes
at the Halls of Justice.

307
00:25:43,262 --> 00:25:44,930
We're closed for the night.

308
00:25:48,392 --> 00:25:51,311
You're holding a package for me.
The code name is Lazarus.

309
00:25:52,397 --> 00:25:54,023
I'll just be a second.

310
00:25:59,947 --> 00:26:01,322
You got a nice place.

311
00:26:02,033 --> 00:26:05,451
Yeah. A lot of this is antiques.

312
00:26:05,661 --> 00:26:10,414
I thought they destroyed all these
A.B.C. Warriors during the last war.

313
00:26:10,457 --> 00:26:12,335
Well, you can still collect 'em

314
00:26:12,461 --> 00:26:15,337
as long as they're nonfunctioning,
like my wife.

315
00:26:16,464 --> 00:26:19,551
These must be 50 or 60 years old now.

316
00:26:19,635 --> 00:26:21,260
Anyway,

317
00:26:22,597 --> 00:26:25,057
there you go.

318
00:26:33,526 --> 00:26:36,652
- Hey, wait a second! Don't touch it.
- Why is that?

319
00:26:36,736 --> 00:26:38,363
It's a Lawgiver.

320
00:26:38,447 --> 00:26:41,532
That's programmed
to only recognize a Judge's hand.

321
00:26:41,616 --> 00:26:43,285
You touch that, it'll take your arm off.

322
00:26:46,163 --> 00:26:48,498
Gee, how do you like that?

323
00:26:49,585 --> 00:26:50,959
I must be a Judge.

324
00:27:24,204 --> 00:27:25,914
Happy birthday.

325
00:27:38,554 --> 00:27:39,929
Status?

326
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:47,020
Bodyguard.

327
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:51,524
- Commander?
- Rico.

328
00:27:51,692 --> 00:27:55,279
- Mission?
- Mission?

329
00:27:55,364 --> 00:27:56,739
We're going to war.

330
00:27:57,949 --> 00:27:59,868
War.

331
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:08,627
I followed up some grumblings
confirming a suspicion of mine.

332
00:28:08,711 --> 00:28:12,339
The cancer of oppression goes
far deeper than the Street Judges.

333
00:28:12,423 --> 00:28:14,926
- You're going to say that over the air?
- It's the truth!

334
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:18,262
- Oh, Vardas, you're insane.
- I'm a reporter.

335
00:28:18,347 --> 00:28:20,808
They're never going to let
this get onto the air.

336
00:28:20,892 --> 00:28:23,434
Something like this could
bring down the Council.

337
00:28:23,477 --> 00:28:24,519
Maybe it should.

338
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:28,023
The whole system is the problem,
not just Judge...

339
00:28:29,275 --> 00:28:30,693
Dredd. No!

340
00:28:45,126 --> 00:28:47,461
Judge Hershey, corner
of Burns and Allen. Level "D."

341
00:28:47,546 --> 00:28:50,798
Possible D.U.I. May need assistance.

342
00:28:52,217 --> 00:28:55,136
Here we go!

343
00:28:56,596 --> 00:29:00,016
- Step out of the car, please.
- What the hell's the problem now?

344
00:29:00,101 --> 00:29:03,645
Get out of the car! Unicard, please.

345
00:29:06,315 --> 00:29:08,276
Did you hear me? Unicard!

346
00:29:10,988 --> 00:29:12,821
Mr. Souza.

347
00:29:13,615 --> 00:29:15,700
You have a suspended license.

348
00:29:15,784 --> 00:29:17,534
You've got three counts
of driving under the influence.

349
00:29:17,618 --> 00:29:18,828
Hey, you better listen.

350
00:29:18,872 --> 00:29:22,207
I suggest you walk away
and bother somebody else.

351
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:25,127
When I said I have powerful friends,
I mean powerful!

352
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:29,298
- Are we having a problem, Hershey?
- Not at all. Nothing I can't handle.

353
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,468
Suspended license. Three D.U.I.'s.

354
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:35,847
Ah! This is getting boring.
Okay, so what's the tab? C'mon.

355
00:29:35,931 --> 00:29:37,848
How much is this going to cost me?
You name your price.

356
00:29:37,932 --> 00:29:39,434
Mmm.

357
00:29:39,685 --> 00:29:41,729
Hershey, call Control for an H-wagon.

358
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:45,064
What? I don't believe it.
You're going to tow me?

359
00:29:45,149 --> 00:29:48,318
Towing is for a first offense.
This is your fourth violation, bar breath.

360
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,072
- You're a menace. How do you plead?
- Not guilty.

361
00:29:51,157 --> 00:29:53,866
I knew you'd say that.

362
00:29:53,909 --> 00:29:56,076
- Wait a second. What are you doing?
- Grenade.

363
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,287
- Grenade.
- No!

364
00:30:03,336 --> 00:30:05,420
Happy motoring.

365
00:30:09,342 --> 00:30:10,718
- Subtle.
- Mmm-hmm.

366
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:13,554
Judge Joseph Dredd.

367
00:30:17,476 --> 00:30:18,768
Dredd, you're under arrest.

368
00:30:19,978 --> 00:30:21,605
What's the charge?

369
00:30:21,689 --> 00:30:23,398
Murder.

370
00:30:28,028 --> 00:30:29,988
Attention. Chief Justice Fargo

371
00:30:30,073 --> 00:30:33,076
now entering maximum security area.

372
00:30:42,921 --> 00:30:44,797
- Joseph.
- Sir.

373
00:30:47,342 --> 00:30:50,761
- Is it true?
- I'm innocent.

374
00:30:51,722 --> 00:30:54,181
The Council is said
to have irrefutable proof.

375
00:30:55,016 --> 00:30:56,393
Do you believe that?

376
00:30:57,186 --> 00:30:59,186
There is to be a full tribunal.

377
00:30:59,271 --> 00:31:02,942
- A conviction means death.
- Do you believe that, sir?

378
00:31:09,782 --> 00:31:13,453
I just needed to look
into your eyes for myself.

379
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:16,247
I'm sorry I asked.

380
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:20,626
I would never do anything
to disgrace you with the Council, sir.

381
00:31:20,669 --> 00:31:23,922
I'll use every resource
to find out, Joseph.

382
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,760
Have you selected
someone to defend you?

383
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:32,514
- Judge Hershey.
- Hershey? Why a Street Judge?

384
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:36,853
At the Academy, she was at the top
of her class in interpretational law.

385
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:39,856
And I trust her.

386
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,025
The facts will come out at the tribunal.

387
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:45,112
I'll personally make sure of that.

388
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:46,989
Sir?

389
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:51,619
I'm sorry about this.

390
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:00,170
Dredd! No!

391
00:32:01,714 --> 00:32:03,173
Play back.

392
00:32:04,717 --> 00:32:06,344
Dredd! No!

393
00:32:07,804 --> 00:32:09,679
Dredd! No!

394
00:32:14,311 --> 00:32:15,646
Play back.

395
00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:18,565
Stop video.

396
00:32:19,942 --> 00:32:23,111
The video you have just seen
is prima facie evidence

397
00:32:23,196 --> 00:32:25,614
that the defendant is guilty as charged.

398
00:32:25,698 --> 00:32:27,992
Mark it "People's Exhibit A."

399
00:32:28,035 --> 00:32:29,993
Objection, Your Honor.

400
00:32:30,036 --> 00:32:31,829
This video is inadmissible as evidence.

401
00:32:33,248 --> 00:32:36,876
- If I may be given a moment to explain?
- Please do.

402
00:32:38,046 --> 00:32:40,546
I have an affidavit
from Nathan Olmeyer,

403
00:32:40,589 --> 00:32:42,383
currently a junior at the Academy.

404
00:32:42,425 --> 00:32:44,884
Cadet Olmeyer has been acknowledged

405
00:32:44,927 --> 00:32:48,890
by every one of his instructors to be
an expert in digital and video graphics.

406
00:32:49,975 --> 00:32:55,397
His affidavit states this surveillance
video is of such low definition,

407
00:32:55,481 --> 00:32:59,026
no positive identification
can be made of the killer.

408
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:01,111
Your Honors,

409
00:33:01,195 --> 00:33:03,571
we know that the uniform
of a Judge can be counterfeit

410
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:05,700
and that the badge can be duplicated,

411
00:33:05,742 --> 00:33:08,744
and since neither the video
nor the audio in this presentation

412
00:33:08,787 --> 00:33:11,831
can identify the accused in any way,

413
00:33:11,915 --> 00:33:15,876
I repeat my objection to this video
being allowed as evidence in this case,

414
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,171
and I ask for a ruling.

415
00:33:28,767 --> 00:33:31,269
Objection sustained.

416
00:33:32,354 --> 00:33:34,272
The video is inadmissible.

417
00:33:34,356 --> 00:33:35,940
Yes!

418
00:33:36,275 --> 00:33:37,609
Shh.

419
00:33:39,446 --> 00:33:40,611
Admit it, Dredd.

420
00:33:40,654 --> 00:33:42,948
- What?
- You're impressed.

421
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,117
- Very.
- You owe me.

422
00:33:46,619 --> 00:33:48,329
- Hmm.
- Very well.

423
00:33:48,414 --> 00:33:50,330
I'm therefore forced to move

424
00:33:50,415 --> 00:33:52,834
to technical information
of a critical nature.

425
00:33:54,128 --> 00:33:55,461
I will need the court's permission

426
00:33:55,503 --> 00:33:59,467
to access top-secret documentation

427
00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:01,634
with the help of Central Computer Bank.

428
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:03,304
You may proceed.

429
00:34:03,388 --> 00:34:05,638
Central, are you on-line?

430
00:34:05,723 --> 00:34:07,683
On-line, Judge McGruder.

431
00:34:07,768 --> 00:34:10,644
I wish you to access
weapons schematic.

432
00:34:10,729 --> 00:34:15,025
Describe the working of the standard
Judge's side arm, the Lawgiver 2.

433
00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:18,571
Model 2 is coded to the personal D.N.A.

434
00:34:18,655 --> 00:34:20,573
Of the Judge using the weapon

435
00:34:20,656 --> 00:34:23,993
via the skin's contact with the grip,
a fail-safe security...

436
00:34:24,036 --> 00:34:26,328
- Did you know about this?
- No!

437
00:34:26,412 --> 00:34:28,915
The D.N.A. Is obtained
from my medical files,

438
00:34:28,999 --> 00:34:33,002
and upgraded automatically
every time the weapon is reloaded.

439
00:34:33,087 --> 00:34:35,506
Each time a round
is chambered and fired,

440
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:38,884
the projectile is tagged
with the relevant D.N.A.

441
00:34:38,968 --> 00:34:42,513
Chief Justice, the defense was not
made aware of any of this information.

442
00:34:42,555 --> 00:34:46,725
Judge Hershey, the prosecution
must be given time to finish.

443
00:34:49,105 --> 00:34:56,027
Central, were the bullets recovered from
the bodies of Vardas and Lily Hammond

444
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,238
so D.N.A. Coded?

445
00:34:58,322 --> 00:35:02,868
Yes, Judge McGruder.
It could not be otherwise.

446
00:35:02,953 --> 00:35:06,704
And what was the result of the computer check

447
00:35:06,832 --> 00:35:09,668
of the D.N.A. Coding on those bullets?

448
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,544
The D.N.A. Is a perfect match

449
00:35:11,586 --> 00:35:13,130
for Judge Joseph Dredd.

450
00:35:13,214 --> 00:35:16,423
It's a lie!
The evidence has been falsified.

451
00:35:16,508 --> 00:35:21,139
It's impossible!
I never broke the Law! I am the Law!

452
00:35:21,223 --> 00:35:24,851
- We have no case.
- You gotta believe me!

453
00:35:24,893 --> 00:35:27,853
You have to believe me. Say it.

454
00:35:28,647 --> 00:35:33,109
Your Honor, the prosecution rests.

455
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,952
The Tribunal needs to confer!

456
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:51,963
What have I done?
How could I have been so wrong?

457
00:35:52,047 --> 00:35:55,092
Dredd! Both of them homicidal.

458
00:35:56,927 --> 00:36:00,180
Only this time it will be
impossible to cover up.

459
00:36:00,265 --> 00:36:02,892
Chief Justice,

460
00:36:02,934 --> 00:36:07,062
we carefully buried the Janus project
nine years ago,

461
00:36:07,105 --> 00:36:10,566
along with Rico and all his victims.

462
00:36:10,609 --> 00:36:13,445
No one will ever learn
of your involvement.

463
00:36:13,487 --> 00:36:16,114
The media knows
how close I am to Dredd.

464
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:19,826
They'll dig until
the whole truth comes out.

465
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:23,456
It's the perfect excuse to ruin
what government we have left.

466
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,625
Your motives were pure.

467
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:27,877
You thought Dredd was different.
That's why you spared him.

468
00:36:27,961 --> 00:36:30,880
A mistake which may bring
down the judicial system.

469
00:36:39,182 --> 00:36:41,808
There is a way out, Chief Justice.

470
00:36:41,893 --> 00:36:43,770
If you will forgive me.

471
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,647
The Long Walk.

472
00:36:49,944 --> 00:36:53,989
That's a death sentence,
Judge Griffin. Mine.

473
00:36:54,074 --> 00:36:58,201
Your retirement grants you
the power to save Dredd's life!

474
00:37:00,205 --> 00:37:05,043
This gesture may also allow Janus

475
00:37:05,127 --> 00:37:07,544
to remain a secret.

476
00:37:14,512 --> 00:37:17,806
In the charge of premeditated murder,

477
00:37:17,848 --> 00:37:20,851
this tribunal finds Joseph Dredd

478
00:37:22,354 --> 00:37:24,772
guilty as charged.

479
00:37:27,734 --> 00:37:29,402
Joseph Dredd,

480
00:37:29,486 --> 00:37:34,700
you're aware the law allows
only one punishment for your crime.

481
00:37:35,618 --> 00:37:36,869
Death.

482
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:40,831
However, it has long been our custom

483
00:37:40,873 --> 00:37:45,878
to carry out the last order
of a retiring Senior Judge.

484
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:50,049
And so,

485
00:37:55,265 --> 00:37:57,057
I step down.

486
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,018
No!

487
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,356
As I leave,

488
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:07,819
to take my Long Walk
into the Cursed Earth,

489
00:38:07,903 --> 00:38:12,907
I ask that this court honor my last order.

490
00:38:14,577 --> 00:38:19,582
Be lenient with Judge Dredd
in gratitude for his years of service.

491
00:38:20,459 --> 00:38:23,418
We will so honor this one, Judge Fargo.

492
00:38:29,051 --> 00:38:31,803
Dredd, step forward.

493
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:37,602
The sentence shall be life imprisonment

494
00:38:37,686 --> 00:38:41,105
at Aspen Penal Colony,
to be carried out immediately

495
00:38:41,982 --> 00:38:43,274
as it is written!

496
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,194
Justice Griffin,
this trial has been a farce!

497
00:38:46,278 --> 00:38:47,488
I demand an appeal!

498
00:38:47,572 --> 00:38:50,907
You will accept the court's decision,
Judge Hershey!

499
00:39:04,798 --> 00:39:07,425
Dredd, I'm so sorry.

500
00:39:07,468 --> 00:39:09,636
I let you down.

501
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:14,808
You did your best, Hershey. Thank you.

502
00:39:16,018 --> 00:39:18,480
Let the betrayer of the Law

503
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,940
be taken from our courts.

504
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,693
Let his armor be taken from him,

505
00:39:24,778 --> 00:39:26,695
and all his garb ofjustice.

506
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:33,578
Let him be stricken from our hearts
and our memory forever.

507
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:47,427
Let his name be recorded
in every place of honor.

508
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:53,851
Let him take the Law he served so well

509
00:39:53,935 --> 00:39:57,020
to those who have it not.

510
00:40:00,066 --> 00:40:02,986
Let him be written

511
00:40:03,028 --> 00:40:08,533
in our hearts and our memories forever.

512
00:40:55,919 --> 00:40:57,419
Attention, all Judges.

513
00:40:57,462 --> 00:40:59,588
You are reminded...

514
00:40:59,672 --> 00:41:01,508
Judge Hershey.

515
00:41:18,735 --> 00:41:20,401
It's gotta be here some...

516
00:41:28,704 --> 00:41:30,121
What's this?

517
00:41:32,793 --> 00:41:33,960
Baby Dredd?

518
00:41:34,002 --> 00:41:36,545
I can't believe you were ever a baby.

519
00:41:40,675 --> 00:41:42,133
Who's this?

520
00:42:00,406 --> 00:42:02,739
Chief Justice Griffin.

521
00:42:09,331 --> 00:42:10,791
It's got a nice ring to it.

522
00:42:10,834 --> 00:42:13,544
We were supposed
to meet someplace safe!

523
00:42:22,053 --> 00:42:26,349
What's not safe?
Your reporter's dead, right?

524
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:29,394
Fargo's on his Walk.

525
00:42:30,104 --> 00:42:31,855
Dredd's in Aspen.

526
00:42:32,773 --> 00:42:34,900
So, what's not safe?

527
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:36,777
It's unfortunate.

528
00:42:38,488 --> 00:42:42,825
Hammond had to be silenced.
He found out about Janus.

529
00:42:43,118 --> 00:42:46,871
- But I could've used Dredd.
- Forget Dredd!

530
00:42:46,913 --> 00:42:49,207
There is no Dredd!

531
00:42:49,417 --> 00:42:52,168
Let me tell you what Dredd worships.

532
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:54,129
He worships the Law!

533
00:42:54,213 --> 00:42:55,715
He'd have blown you away

534
00:42:55,883 --> 00:42:58,384
the minute he found out
how much you're pissin' on it.

535
00:43:01,347 --> 00:43:05,851
Yeah. Let him see what it's like
to freeze his ass off in Aspen.

536
00:43:06,144 --> 00:43:07,894
Let him see what it's like to be me!

537
00:43:10,732 --> 00:43:12,482
There's a lot of work to be done.

538
00:43:12,566 --> 00:43:16,654
Janus. Well, where is it?

539
00:43:16,905 --> 00:43:18,739
- You'll see it!
- When?

540
00:43:18,782 --> 00:43:20,033
Soon enough!

541
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,961
In the meantime, I want chaos, Rico.

542
00:43:32,421 --> 00:43:34,839
That block war was just the beginning.

543
00:43:34,924 --> 00:43:39,136
Now I want fear
racing through every street!

544
00:43:39,763 --> 00:43:42,640
And the Council will have to turn to me.

545
00:43:43,016 --> 00:43:45,101
And to Janus!

546
00:43:45,143 --> 00:43:46,269
You want fear?

547
00:43:47,605 --> 00:43:49,272
I'm fear.

548
00:43:49,315 --> 00:43:52,651
You want chaos? I'm the chaos.

549
00:43:52,902 --> 00:43:56,363
You want a new beginning?
Here! I am the new beginning!

550
00:44:06,166 --> 00:44:08,502
This is Aspen Shuttle CF-188.

551
00:44:08,586 --> 00:44:13,090
Due to storm cloud activity over the
desert, we will be flying at 60 feet.

552
00:44:13,133 --> 00:44:16,635
Flight time approximately four hours.

553
00:44:34,614 --> 00:44:38,284
Dredd? Don't hit me. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Don't hurt me.

554
00:44:38,326 --> 00:44:41,246
What are you doing here?

555
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:45,375
I was convicted of a crime.
Wrongly convicted.

556
00:44:48,838 --> 00:44:51,299
Really? That's kinda weird.

557
00:44:51,675 --> 00:44:53,133
What are the odds?

558
00:44:53,176 --> 00:44:57,305
Two wrongly-convicted guys
sittin' right next to each other.

559
00:44:58,181 --> 00:45:00,683
You received the sentence
the Law required.

560
00:45:00,726 --> 00:45:05,563
Five years just for saving my own ass?

561
00:45:05,856 --> 00:45:07,649
That was a mistake!

562
00:45:07,983 --> 00:45:10,402
The Law doesn't make mistakes.

563
00:45:11,362 --> 00:45:15,449
Really? Then how do you explain
what happened to you?

564
00:45:19,622 --> 00:45:22,165
You can't, can you?

565
00:45:23,709 --> 00:45:27,295
Great! Mr. "I am the Law" can't.

566
00:45:27,379 --> 00:45:30,674
So, maybe, this is some kind of typo.

567
00:45:31,384 --> 00:45:33,219
Maybe it's a glitch.

568
00:45:33,428 --> 00:45:36,764
Or maybe it's poetic justice!

569
00:45:46,234 --> 00:45:48,400
Shuttle comin'! Shuttle! Shuttle!

570
00:45:48,443 --> 00:45:52,031
Shuttle comin', Pa! Look!

571
00:45:55,077 --> 00:45:59,496
Praise the Lord for bringing us
this generous bounty.

572
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:03,835
My sons, gather the harvest.

573
00:46:07,799 --> 00:46:11,719
So maybe you're here
as some sort of field trip.

574
00:46:12,596 --> 00:46:14,179
Yeah!

575
00:46:14,264 --> 00:46:17,141
Maybe this is some
sort of surprise party.

576
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,936
Whoo! Gonna catch me some city boy!

577
00:46:26,611 --> 00:46:29,112
It's payback time, Dredd!

578
00:46:48,343 --> 00:46:50,176
Dredd, what's happening?

579
00:46:55,225 --> 00:46:57,560
By a blast of God they perish.

580
00:46:59,187 --> 00:47:02,273
And by a breath of His nostrils
are they consumed.

581
00:47:04,028 --> 00:47:05,277
Hallelujah!

582
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:17,749
Central, I need you to access graphics database.

583
00:47:18,167 --> 00:47:20,668
I want you to run an I.D. On this man.

584
00:47:20,753 --> 00:47:23,339
Scanning for identity. Unknown male,

585
00:47:23,381 --> 00:47:27,676
approximately 200 centimeters tall,
skin tone three.

586
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:29,761
Ten, nine, eight...

587
00:47:31,973 --> 00:47:34,392
Central? Hello?

588
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:38,438
This terminal has been terminated from the main system.

589
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,691
Your authority has been removed,
Judge Hershey.

590
00:47:49,034 --> 00:47:52,161
This is Group Leader.
We've located the shuttle.

591
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:04,383
This is Capture Team.
There's no sign of Dredd.

592
00:48:04,425 --> 00:48:07,052
He appears to have survived the crash.

593
00:48:07,095 --> 00:48:08,846
You are in error, Capture Team.

594
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:10,555
No one survived the shuttle wreck.

595
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,849
Understand? Just find Dredd!

596
00:48:12,892 --> 00:48:15,228
The pilot, sir. He's alive.

597
00:48:15,312 --> 00:48:18,648
No one survived the shuttle wreck!
Do I make myself clear?

598
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:20,024
Yes, sir.

599
00:48:36,711 --> 00:48:38,086
Am I dead?

600
00:48:38,796 --> 00:48:41,256
Am I dead? I'm dead!

601
00:48:48,765 --> 00:48:49,849
Awake!

602
00:48:49,933 --> 00:48:51,183
Good!

603
00:48:52,227 --> 00:48:54,395
We're running out of sinners.

604
00:48:56,441 --> 00:48:58,066
Oh, my God!

605
00:49:04,824 --> 00:49:07,785
- Dredd, do something!
- Dredd?

606
00:49:08,495 --> 00:49:10,204
You talk too much.

607
00:49:11,664 --> 00:49:13,041
Can it be?

608
00:49:27,432 --> 00:49:29,851
The great man of the Law himself.

609
00:49:36,149 --> 00:49:40,196
O Lord, you have blessed us indeed!

610
00:49:41,655 --> 00:49:45,201
Judge "Rat" Dredd.

611
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,327
You creeps are under arrest.

612
00:49:47,369 --> 00:49:48,996
Is that so?

613
00:49:49,664 --> 00:49:51,791
Let me crush him, Pa.

614
00:49:52,334 --> 00:49:54,710
Excuse me. We're not together.

615
00:49:56,088 --> 00:49:58,924
Allow me to introduce you to my family.

616
00:49:59,675 --> 00:50:02,302
- There's Link, my oldest.
- Bite me!

617
00:50:02,345 --> 00:50:03,512
Hi!

618
00:50:03,596 --> 00:50:05,848
My youngest, Junior.

619
00:50:05,891 --> 00:50:08,016
- Howdy.
- Hi!

620
00:50:09,853 --> 00:50:12,355
And this here is Mean.

621
00:50:12,606 --> 00:50:16,567
We had to make some alterations
when he was a child.

622
00:50:16,652 --> 00:50:19,822
The Cursed Earth's
a tough place on young folks.

623
00:50:19,864 --> 00:50:24,701
I now have him set on one.
I don't suggest you make him angry.

624
00:50:26,495 --> 00:50:28,831
The legendary Angel family.

625
00:50:30,042 --> 00:50:32,251
Cursed Earth pirates,

626
00:50:32,335 --> 00:50:35,630
murderers, scavengers.

627
00:50:37,006 --> 00:50:41,137
- And, of course, scumbags.
- Oh, that'll win 'em over!

628
00:50:41,513 --> 00:50:44,306
Did I leave something out, Pa?

629
00:50:44,391 --> 00:50:46,559
- Let me kill 'im, Pa. I want his ears.
- I want his teeth.

630
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:57,403
Does that come with a fork, handsome?

631
00:51:05,789 --> 00:51:07,998
Hallelujah, brother!

632
00:51:08,082 --> 00:51:10,501
Wait a minute. Can it be?

633
00:51:10,586 --> 00:51:13,504
Can it be that from the city of the fallen,

634
00:51:13,589 --> 00:51:16,466
- we have one of the faithful?
- Amen, brother!

635
00:51:18,093 --> 00:51:21,431
- Praise the Lord! I'm a believer!
- Fergie, don't do it.

636
00:51:21,515 --> 00:51:23,974
It sounds like we have
a believer in the gallery.

637
00:51:24,058 --> 00:51:25,851
- Yes!
- Cut him down!

638
00:51:25,935 --> 00:51:28,103
- Go tell it on the mountain!
- Fergie.

639
00:51:32,776 --> 00:51:34,861
You're making a big mistake.

640
00:51:35,446 --> 00:51:38,114
Well, Dredd, maybe the Law
doesn't make mistakes,

641
00:51:38,157 --> 00:51:41,451
but I'm free and you're toast.

642
00:51:41,493 --> 00:51:43,913
Actually, you're toast.

643
00:51:44,497 --> 00:51:45,998
I forgot to mention it.

644
00:51:46,208 --> 00:51:48,000
Your new friends,

645
00:51:49,794 --> 00:51:50,878
they're cannibals.

646
00:51:53,466 --> 00:51:54,758
Fresh meat.

647
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,468
Prepare the supplicant for sacrifice.

648
00:51:57,552 --> 00:51:59,763
No, wait. You can't eat me!

649
00:51:59,805 --> 00:52:03,558
I've got eczema. I've got warts.
I've had gonorrhea.

650
00:52:03,644 --> 00:52:05,645
Eat Dredd. He works out.

651
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,730
Yum, yum.

652
00:52:08,814 --> 00:52:11,400
It's been fun, Lawman.

653
00:52:14,948 --> 00:52:16,406
Finish Dredd.

654
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:19,910
My pleasure, Pa.

655
00:52:20,161 --> 00:52:21,370
Come on.

656
00:52:26,502 --> 00:52:28,710
Come on!

657
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:31,839
Come on, Junior!

658
00:52:33,342 --> 00:52:34,509
Guilty!

659
00:52:38,264 --> 00:52:39,681
Shut up!

660
00:52:46,649 --> 00:52:48,232
Dredd, look out!

661
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:56,616
There's Dredd!

662
00:53:10,382 --> 00:53:11,757
Go!

663
00:53:43,418 --> 00:53:45,712
Well, we did it. We got 'em all.

664
00:53:46,589 --> 00:53:48,756
- Hmm.
- Pussies! Is that all you got?

665
00:53:48,923 --> 00:53:50,925
They are dead, right?

666
00:53:53,137 --> 00:53:54,386
Have you been crying?

667
00:53:54,429 --> 00:53:57,016
I'm not crying.
I got something in my eye.

668
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,476
You ever have allergies?
Dredd, look out!

669
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:11,947
Chief Justice!

670
00:54:12,283 --> 00:54:15,159
Joseph, together again.

671
00:54:15,786 --> 00:54:17,830
Together again, sir.

672
00:54:22,126 --> 00:54:23,252
No!

673
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:31,677
God, not again!

674
00:54:37,142 --> 00:54:39,062
You got three strikes, Lawman!

675
00:54:40,313 --> 00:54:41,772
Strike one.

676
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:45,109
Strike two!

677
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:51,741
Strike three.

678
00:54:51,826 --> 00:54:54,327
You're out, Lawman!

679
00:54:54,411 --> 00:54:57,622
You killed Link! You killed Junior!

680
00:54:57,665 --> 00:54:59,999
You killed my brothers!

681
00:55:00,042 --> 00:55:02,628
You even killed my pa.

682
00:55:06,133 --> 00:55:09,010
Mega City municipal code 4722,

683
00:55:09,095 --> 00:55:11,638
illegal use of city electricity.

684
00:55:12,473 --> 00:55:14,640
How do you plead?

685
00:55:14,975 --> 00:55:16,893
I knew you'd say that!

686
00:55:23,193 --> 00:55:25,318
Graphics analysis now.

687
00:55:26,112 --> 00:55:29,741
Olmeyer, you stupid futz! I can't...

688
00:55:29,825 --> 00:55:31,367
You analyzed the wrong viewie,
all right.

689
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:33,078
The wrong one. This one!

690
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:36,289
I don't believe it.
You just wasted three hours.

691
00:55:38,042 --> 00:55:40,335
If this is the wrong picture,

692
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,796
why is it fake?

693
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,883
What?

694
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:50,346
Look. It's full of anomalies.
Really clever ones too.

695
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:52,724
Somebody must've used
a C.G.I. Terminal

696
00:55:52,808 --> 00:55:54,935
and a scan quad to make this.

697
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:58,188
This is state-of-the-art,
twenty years ago.

698
00:55:58,898 --> 00:56:01,358
Are you saying this isn't real?

699
00:56:01,401 --> 00:56:04,696
Yeah. Look, I'll drop out
all the artificial pixels.

700
00:56:04,739 --> 00:56:07,823
Dad. Mom.

701
00:56:09,034 --> 00:56:10,410
Foreground.

702
00:56:10,912 --> 00:56:13,538
Background. All fake.

703
00:56:15,416 --> 00:56:18,084
The only thing that's real is the baby.

704
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:32,142
Oh. The blind lady.

705
00:56:34,646 --> 00:56:36,020
Who is she?

706
00:56:36,188 --> 00:56:38,690
Justice, before your time.

707
00:56:40,109 --> 00:56:43,947
We should never have taken
justice out of her hands.

708
00:56:44,532 --> 00:56:48,117
- You brought order to chaos, sir.
- That we did.

709
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:52,080
Solved many problems,
and created many more!

710
00:56:53,458 --> 00:56:56,209
Being a Judge, Joseph,

711
00:56:56,877 --> 00:57:00,422
perhaps too much power
in one person's hands.

712
00:57:01,632 --> 00:57:06,095
We once tried to compensate,
create the perfect Judge.

713
00:57:06,638 --> 00:57:08,640
We called it Janus.

714
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:11,767
Four decades ago,

715
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:15,648
D.N.A. Samples were taken
from the original Council.

716
00:57:16,482 --> 00:57:18,608
One was chosen. Mine.

717
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:22,822
We altered it to enhance
the best qualities

718
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:25,409
and screen out the worst,

719
00:57:25,493 --> 00:57:28,077
weaknesses, frailties.

720
00:57:30,415 --> 00:57:32,081
We created you.

721
00:57:34,252 --> 00:57:36,295
You didn't create me, sir.

722
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:40,007
- I have a family.
- No.

723
00:57:40,091 --> 00:57:43,845
At the Academy, you told me they
were killed when I was very young.

724
00:57:43,887 --> 00:57:45,096
A lie.

725
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,017
I have a picture of them.

726
00:57:49,435 --> 00:57:52,437
A fake. We lied to both of you.

727
00:57:53,732 --> 00:57:55,190
Both?

728
00:57:55,483 --> 00:57:58,944
There was another infant
created in that experiment,

729
00:57:59,029 --> 00:58:01,196
but something went wrong.

730
00:58:02,198 --> 00:58:05,535
Genetically mutated
to the perfect criminal.

731
00:58:06,828 --> 00:58:08,496
I have a brother?

732
00:58:08,539 --> 00:58:11,749
You were best friends at the Academy.
Star pupils.

733
00:58:12,375 --> 00:58:16,713
And then he turned.
And for his crimes, you judged him.

734
00:58:18,884 --> 00:58:20,801
Rico?

735
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,180
Rico.

736
00:58:25,892 --> 00:58:30,896
You let me judge my own brother?
You never told me, sir.

737
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:31,979
I couldn't!

738
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,697
You were like a son to me!

739
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:41,240
A son.

740
00:58:43,201 --> 00:58:45,746
My whole life is a lie.

741
00:58:47,289 --> 00:58:52,085
Rico had to be executed to protect you,
to protect the city.

742
00:58:52,169 --> 00:58:57,132
Rico.

743
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,135
He's alive!

744
00:59:00,929 --> 00:59:02,097
No.

745
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:04,181
I signed the order myself.

746
00:59:04,557 --> 00:59:07,519
- I saw the report.
- I didn't kill Hammond.

747
00:59:08,062 --> 00:59:09,604
It was him.

748
00:59:09,689 --> 00:59:12,691
It was his D.N.A. That convicted me.

749
00:59:12,775 --> 00:59:15,318
Griffin. It was Griffin.

750
00:59:16,028 --> 00:59:17,280
Griffin, yes.

751
00:59:17,364 --> 00:59:21,117
We've both been deceived, Joseph.
I'm so sorry.

752
00:59:21,201 --> 00:59:24,495
Rico's killed me and destroyed you!

753
00:59:25,122 --> 00:59:27,791
Find him, Joseph.

754
00:59:28,876 --> 00:59:29,960
Don't die.

755
01:00:18,137 --> 01:00:22,058
What do we do?

756
01:00:23,894 --> 01:00:25,603
Find Rico.

757
01:00:32,279 --> 01:00:33,695
Welcome to Janus.

758
01:00:36,741 --> 01:00:39,452
Rico, I think you know Dr. Hayden.

759
01:00:39,536 --> 01:00:41,204
I remember you.

760
01:00:41,246 --> 01:00:44,373
Testified before the Council
that I was insane, right?

761
01:00:44,416 --> 01:00:48,253
- And therefore innocent.
- I was trying to save your life.

762
01:00:48,337 --> 01:00:51,799
What you did was insult me,
'cause I knew exactly what I was doing.

763
01:00:51,883 --> 01:00:53,342
Then and now.

764
01:01:07,566 --> 01:01:11,403
Miss Hayden has been a loyal
supporter of this project for a long time.

765
01:01:11,488 --> 01:01:12,738
She's kept it alive for me.

766
01:01:12,781 --> 01:01:16,242
I'm sure you'll find
her expertise invaluable.

767
01:01:16,284 --> 01:01:17,910
Excuse me!

768
01:01:17,953 --> 01:01:21,122
All this is useless if you can't get
into Central's Janus files,

769
01:01:21,207 --> 01:01:23,291
'cause the Council has 'em locked.

770
01:01:23,376 --> 01:01:24,834
Leave that to me.

771
01:01:24,918 --> 01:01:28,171
Meanwhile you have work to do,
on the streets.

772
01:01:28,256 --> 01:01:31,300
- Ilsa will help you.
- I don't need no help! Thanks.

773
01:01:33,053 --> 01:01:37,932
I thought you said he was created here
by the finest scientists of Mega City.

774
01:01:37,975 --> 01:01:40,267
A bold experiment.

775
01:01:42,522 --> 01:01:44,438
He's a petulant child.

776
01:01:45,691 --> 01:01:48,694
Let's not bicker.
We're here to achieve the same thing.

777
01:01:50,112 --> 01:01:51,738
An ordered society.

778
01:01:55,243 --> 01:01:57,327
You'll have your New Order.

779
01:01:59,289 --> 01:02:03,210
Attention, all Judges.
Reporting unrest, code D-924.

780
01:02:03,295 --> 01:02:06,462
Downtown, Sector 12.
Backup requested.

781
01:02:22,147 --> 01:02:25,400
Nineteen different explosions in 11 different sectors.

782
01:02:25,651 --> 01:02:28,612
Extra caution to be taken
on approach to 914...

783
01:02:34,161 --> 01:02:36,913
Search all areas bordering the Elite Building.

784
01:02:36,997 --> 01:02:39,373
The anonymous caller
did not specify capacity.

785
01:02:39,499 --> 01:02:41,542
Proceed with caution.

786
01:03:01,857 --> 01:03:03,191
My boy!

787
01:03:10,074 --> 01:03:12,576
Dredd, there's no way in!

788
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:14,245
Hello?

789
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:17,122
Are you even listening to me?

790
01:03:17,248 --> 01:03:21,335
We can't just knock on the wall
and say, "Hello, Cursed Earth Pizza."

791
01:03:21,378 --> 01:03:23,672
There is a way in.

792
01:03:23,714 --> 01:03:26,508
Six years ago,
two refugees figured it out.

793
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:30,595
It's a vent to the city's incinerator.
There's a burst twice a minute.

794
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:32,555
That means somebody
could run through that tube

795
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,226
and have 30 seconds
before it flames again.

796
01:03:36,812 --> 01:03:40,564
And these refugees,
they made it through, right?

797
01:03:40,649 --> 01:03:42,316
Actually, they were roasted.

798
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:45,570
But the theory's sound. Shall we?

799
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:50,076
Maybe we should consider other theories.
Dredd!

800
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,958
Dispatch, I'm in Green Quad 411.
Need a pickup.

801
01:03:57,042 --> 01:04:00,253
Copy, Hershey.
I have Central on-line for you.

802
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:02,755
Patch it to my Lawmaster.

803
01:04:09,764 --> 01:04:12,224
Warning.
Alien device on board.

804
01:04:13,435 --> 01:04:14,935
Oh, my God!

805
01:04:18,607 --> 01:04:21,942
Latest casualty report,
96 Judges have been assassinated!

806
01:04:21,985 --> 01:04:24,612
Whoever's doing this seems
to know all our procedures,

807
01:04:24,655 --> 01:04:27,073
our security measures,
even our scrambled frequencies.

808
01:04:27,116 --> 01:04:28,242
With no Judges on the street,

809
01:04:28,285 --> 01:04:30,327
riots are breaking out
all over Mega City.

810
01:04:30,412 --> 01:04:32,620
We can't replace those Judges.

811
01:04:32,663 --> 01:04:36,166
Even if we put the cadets on the street,
we won't be at full strength for years!

812
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:38,002
There is a solution.

813
01:04:41,256 --> 01:04:43,424
Project Janus.

814
01:04:43,467 --> 01:04:46,218
This Council tried
to play God once before.

815
01:04:46,303 --> 01:04:49,223
If this wholesale slaughter
of Judges continues,

816
01:04:49,308 --> 01:04:51,308
there won't be a Council.

817
01:04:52,018 --> 01:04:54,228
- Janus could...
- Janus could what?

818
01:04:54,313 --> 01:04:57,272
A new batch of test-tube babies
won't solve this crisis.

819
01:04:57,316 --> 01:04:59,484
We don't need reliable Judges
20 years from now,

820
01:04:59,569 --> 01:05:00,778
we need them today!

821
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:05,115
Accelerated growth incubators
are more developed now.

822
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:09,745
We could create adult subjects.

823
01:05:11,998 --> 01:05:14,833
All I'm asking is that
we unlock the Janus files.

824
01:05:14,876 --> 01:05:17,628
That way we at least have an option!

825
01:05:19,465 --> 01:05:21,841
If the Council decides not to go forward,

826
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:25,011
I'll accept that decision and resign.

827
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,525
- All right, you ready, kid?
- No!

828
01:05:37,567 --> 01:05:40,403
- Now what's wrong?
- What's wrong? Are you kidding?

829
01:05:40,488 --> 01:05:43,532
Did wearing that helmet all those years
compress your brain?

830
01:05:43,616 --> 01:05:46,034
- You're gonna get me killed.
- There's a maniac loose in this city!

831
01:05:46,119 --> 01:05:47,284
What a coincidence!

832
01:05:47,369 --> 01:05:50,081
- There's one out here too!
- Oh.

833
01:05:50,332 --> 01:05:51,790
Great time I'm having.

834
01:05:51,874 --> 01:05:55,044
The shuttle crash,
the Cursed Earth, cannibals.

835
01:05:55,129 --> 01:05:57,379
And now a fireball up my ass!

836
01:05:57,463 --> 01:05:59,424
- This is all your fault!
- My fault?

837
01:05:59,509 --> 01:06:01,552
- Yes!
- You care to explain that, citizen?

838
01:06:01,636 --> 01:06:05,055
If you hadn't arrested me,
I wouldn't be here in the first place.

839
01:06:05,098 --> 01:06:07,557
Hey, Dredd, what if
you just kill me now?

840
01:06:09,561 --> 01:06:13,564
That's it!
I'm through schlepping.

841
01:06:13,606 --> 01:06:17,401
I'm gonna stay here until
I'm caught or 'til you apologize!

842
01:06:17,443 --> 01:06:21,532
- The Law can't apologize!
- You're not the Law anymore.

843
01:06:21,575 --> 01:06:24,701
Now apologize. I think I deserve that.

844
01:06:25,745 --> 01:06:27,620
I've never apologized.

845
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:34,753
Now run!

846
01:06:35,797 --> 01:06:38,090
Thirty, twenty-nine, twenty-eight,

847
01:06:38,175 --> 01:06:40,593
- twenty-seven, twenty-six...
- Run!

848
01:06:40,678 --> 01:06:44,598
Twenty-five, twenty-four,
twenty-three, twenty-two,

849
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,976
twenty-one, nineteen...

850
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:50,645
Dredd? Dredd!

851
01:06:52,275 --> 01:06:55,151
Dredd! I don't wanna die!

852
01:07:04,495 --> 01:07:05,704
Jump!

853
01:07:19,136 --> 01:07:22,805
I'm alive!

854
01:07:23,474 --> 01:07:25,100
Oh, so are you.

855
01:07:28,938 --> 01:07:31,815
Esposito, Carlos. Council Judge.

856
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:36,279
Authorize access to file,
code name Janus.

857
01:07:37,490 --> 01:07:39,990
Acknowledged.

858
01:07:40,033 --> 01:07:45,163
McGruder, Evelyn. Authorize
access to file, code name Janus.

859
01:07:46,166 --> 01:07:47,999
Acknowledged.

860
01:07:48,209 --> 01:07:50,126
Silver, Gerald.

861
01:07:50,378 --> 01:07:53,339
Authorize access to file,
code name Janus.

862
01:07:53,382 --> 01:07:55,508
Removing security blocks now.

863
01:07:55,592 --> 01:07:59,178
Awaiting password command
from presiding Chief Justice.

864
01:07:59,221 --> 01:08:01,472
Password, origin.

865
01:08:01,515 --> 01:08:03,266
Janus file opened.

866
01:08:08,898 --> 01:08:12,025
Attention.
Until emergency repairs are completed,

867
01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:14,237
Ward "C" locker room is off limits.

868
01:08:17,324 --> 01:08:19,450
I'm lost. Is this the bathroom?

869
01:08:19,535 --> 01:08:21,703
Hey!

870
01:08:22,329 --> 01:08:24,707
Now you have to admit,
I helped out on that one.

871
01:08:24,791 --> 01:08:27,042
I mean, that was all me, baby!

872
01:08:27,669 --> 01:08:30,629
Hey, hey...
Why are you taking off his clothes?

873
01:08:32,215 --> 01:08:34,342
We don't have time for this.

874
01:08:36,887 --> 01:08:41,016
Central, using current technology,

875
01:08:41,976 --> 01:08:46,397
how long would it take for Janus to
produce a fully-grown adult subject?

876
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:49,232
Given the current state of genetic engineering,

877
01:08:49,317 --> 01:08:52,945
an adult subject could be incubated
in approximately eight hours.

878
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:57,534
- We could replace our losses in a day.
- This is madness.

879
01:08:58,077 --> 01:08:59,410
Ah, Dredd?

880
01:08:59,494 --> 01:09:00,912
- Silence.
- Dredd!

881
01:09:00,955 --> 01:09:03,040
Shh. I'm busy.

882
01:09:03,082 --> 01:09:04,915
Dredd?

883
01:09:08,255 --> 01:09:12,091
It's inhuman.
It's not for this Council to play God!

884
01:09:12,176 --> 01:09:15,469
No, Griffin.
Please restore the security blocks.

885
01:09:15,553 --> 01:09:19,766
It seems none of you have the force
of will that these times require.

886
01:09:21,018 --> 01:09:24,312
Central, leave Janus unlocked.

887
01:09:24,438 --> 01:09:28,234
Griffin, this is treason.
You have just sealed your fate.

888
01:09:28,444 --> 01:09:29,526
No!

889
01:09:30,278 --> 01:09:33,948
You have just sealed yours! Rico!

890
01:09:47,798 --> 01:09:50,049
Now who says politics is boring?

891
01:09:50,967 --> 01:09:53,094
Hey, Dredd! I thought it was you.

892
01:09:53,136 --> 01:09:55,346
That's right! Cover your ears!

893
01:09:59,894 --> 01:10:02,646
- Rico.
- Joseph.

894
01:10:10,197 --> 01:10:12,031
Get out of here, now!

895
01:10:14,326 --> 01:10:15,451
No!

896
01:10:19,082 --> 01:10:21,834
- You're under arrest, Griffin.
- Really?

897
01:10:28,426 --> 01:10:31,678
Stop him!
He just killed the entire Council!

898
01:10:31,762 --> 01:10:35,097
- Move it out!
- Dredd, tell them I'm innocent.

899
01:10:35,181 --> 01:10:36,598
Whoa!

900
01:10:49,407 --> 01:10:53,076
Come on, Fergie! Run!

901
01:10:53,161 --> 01:10:56,078
You're a lot of fun to be with, Dredd.
You know that?

902
01:11:02,712 --> 01:11:05,797
- What are you gonna do?
- Hope it works.

903
01:11:08,593 --> 01:11:09,636
Malfunction.

904
01:11:09,721 --> 01:11:11,179
What is wrong with this piece of shit?

905
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:23,108
That's a solid brick wall!
You're going to kill us!

906
01:11:30,826 --> 01:11:34,245
Dredd! You gotta make it work!

907
01:11:34,288 --> 01:11:35,997
Make it work!

908
01:11:36,081 --> 01:11:38,541
Malfunction. Malfunction. On-line.

909
01:11:45,425 --> 01:11:48,886
Dredd, you may want to wash this seat
after we get off the bike.

910
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:51,472
- Hmm.
- Sorry.

911
01:11:55,769 --> 01:11:57,812
Dredd, move it!

912
01:12:13,331 --> 01:12:16,123
- Fergie, cover the rear.
- I've never fired a gun in my life!

913
01:12:16,166 --> 01:12:19,670
- What kind of a criminal are you?
- A nice criminal.

914
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:26,301
- Nothing's happening!
- You gotta cock it first, moron.

915
01:12:26,344 --> 01:12:28,387
You didn't say anything about cocking.

916
01:12:29,431 --> 01:12:30,640
Nice!

917
01:12:43,655 --> 01:12:45,991
Stop! Please, God!

918
01:13:01,383 --> 01:13:03,342
You can drop me off here.

919
01:13:08,015 --> 01:13:10,766
- Dredd, that's a dead end.
- I know.

920
01:13:33,333 --> 01:13:35,210
Oh, God!

921
01:13:40,216 --> 01:13:42,050
Fergie, take over!

922
01:13:42,134 --> 01:13:44,387
Where are you going? Dredd!

923
01:13:44,430 --> 01:13:46,556
This is where you get off, creep!

924
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:57,984
Need a lift, kid?

925
01:14:05,536 --> 01:14:07,079
I'm never riding with you again, Dredd!

926
01:14:19,258 --> 01:14:22,386
She's definitely not gonna get her
cleaning deposit back, that's for sure.

927
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:28,643
It doesn't pay to be
one of your friends, Dredd. Sorry!

928
01:14:41,324 --> 01:14:44,326
Hands against the wall.
You know the drill.

929
01:14:46,831 --> 01:14:48,205
- Who are you?
- Dredd said that...

930
01:14:48,290 --> 01:14:49,708
Shut up!

931
01:14:50,876 --> 01:14:52,876
- What happened?
- Why don't you tell me, Dredd, huh?

932
01:14:52,961 --> 01:14:56,966
We're dyin' out there!
108 Judges in 48 hours!

933
01:14:57,384 --> 01:14:58,675
What the hell is going on?

934
01:15:00,887 --> 01:15:02,513
You think I'm part of this?

935
01:15:02,597 --> 01:15:05,891
I don't know
who or what you are anymore.

936
01:15:13,608 --> 01:15:16,278
I would never do anything
to hurt you, Hersh.

937
01:15:17,406 --> 01:15:18,947
You know that.

938
01:15:24,328 --> 01:15:25,662
All right.

939
01:15:27,249 --> 01:15:29,375
You tell me about him, huh?

940
01:15:30,502 --> 01:15:34,172
You make me believe in you
like I did when I defended you.

941
01:15:34,339 --> 01:15:36,048
His name is Rico,

942
01:15:37,385 --> 01:15:39,303
and he's my brother.

943
01:15:39,387 --> 01:15:42,682
The D.N.A. Sample has been taken out of frozen stasis.

944
01:15:42,850 --> 01:15:46,977
- Ready for cloning process.
- We got a slight change of plans here.

945
01:15:48,022 --> 01:15:52,025
I want to take the existing
D.N.A. Sample right now and trash it.

946
01:15:53,111 --> 01:15:55,779
Activate this D.N.A. Sampling console.

947
01:15:56,363 --> 01:15:58,531
What are you doing?

948
01:15:58,574 --> 01:16:02,870
Central, take this D.N.A. Sample now.

949
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:05,664
This wasn't part of our plan!

950
01:16:05,707 --> 01:16:08,209
Judge Griffin would never
have authorized this!

951
01:16:08,293 --> 01:16:09,669
Processing.

952
01:16:09,712 --> 01:16:13,672
You know, Griffin got to be my keeper
by putting me behind bars.

953
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:18,637
What's your excuse?

954
01:16:21,558 --> 01:16:24,392
You said I had no feelings
and no emotions.

955
01:16:26,188 --> 01:16:27,647
Now you know why.

956
01:16:27,731 --> 01:16:30,526
Dredd, look at me.

957
01:16:33,404 --> 01:16:38,283
The Janus project didn't do that to you.
You did that to yourself.

958
01:16:39,994 --> 01:16:42,080
Sorry, guys, I'm getting
nowhere with your terminal.

959
01:16:42,122 --> 01:16:45,499
But I fixed the microwave.
You want some popcorn?

960
01:16:46,544 --> 01:16:48,086
Is this a bad time?

961
01:16:49,087 --> 01:16:53,050
Look, I tried dialing everything I
could think of to find this Janus thing.

962
01:16:53,093 --> 01:16:56,678
It just isn't in the program.
Nowhere. Nothing.

963
01:16:57,138 --> 01:16:59,597
They'd never take a chance
and put it on the computer network,

964
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:02,143
but they need power and they're
gonna steal it from somewhere.

965
01:17:02,228 --> 01:17:05,271
Check every sector for recent blackouts
and sudden power surges.

966
01:17:05,438 --> 01:17:07,398
- Great. Let's stay here longer!
- Wait a second.

967
01:17:08,526 --> 01:17:10,943
Just before they blew up
my Lawmaster in Sector 4,

968
01:17:11,028 --> 01:17:14,698
there was a power surge,
a really big one, three blocks wide.

969
01:17:15,032 --> 01:17:16,825
The last time I felt something like that,

970
01:17:16,909 --> 01:17:19,245
they shut down the whole power grid
in that area, remember?

971
01:17:19,288 --> 01:17:21,914
When they moved the Statue of Liberty,
they put it right down on top of it.

972
01:17:21,957 --> 01:17:24,126
- Right.
- Could we go now?

973
01:17:24,877 --> 01:17:27,753
Dredd, that's twice you owe me.

974
01:17:32,886 --> 01:17:36,930
Rico! Dredd got away from the hunters.

975
01:17:36,973 --> 01:17:39,933
Well, he's about to be
seriously outnumbered.

976
01:17:39,976 --> 01:17:42,979
- Right, Central?
- Affirmative, Judge Rico.

977
01:17:43,022 --> 01:17:45,315
The new D.N.A. Sample
has been multiplexed,

978
01:17:45,399 --> 01:17:47,525
and the gametes are already dividing.

979
01:17:47,610 --> 01:17:49,319
New sample?

980
01:17:49,403 --> 01:17:51,696
You left that D.N.A.
In there for over 30 years!

981
01:17:52,156 --> 01:17:54,116
Sooner or later, somebody's
gonna clean out the fridge.

982
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:58,829
That sample was created from the finest
specimens on the Council of Judges!

983
01:17:58,872 --> 01:18:01,332
What did you replace it with?

984
01:18:02,334 --> 01:18:04,753
No. My God.

985
01:18:05,378 --> 01:18:08,673
You should congratulate me right now,
'cause I'm about to be a daddy.

986
01:18:08,758 --> 01:18:11,008
You're being very, very rude.

987
01:18:11,092 --> 01:18:13,012
You don't know what you're doing!

988
01:18:13,055 --> 01:18:17,016
The next batch of Janus Judges are not
going to be the puppets that you want!

989
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:20,518
They're gonna be my brothers
and sisters! And mine to control!

990
01:18:21,187 --> 01:18:24,858
I can't let you do this.
You're both insane! I have to stop...

991
01:18:29,906 --> 01:18:33,743
Central, help me!

992
01:18:34,161 --> 01:18:36,578
I'm sorry, Chief Justice,
the A.B.C. Robot

993
01:18:36,663 --> 01:18:39,082
is not tied into my main processor.

994
01:18:39,166 --> 01:18:42,834
That's right, Griff.
You gotta get with this high-tech stuff.

995
01:18:42,877 --> 01:18:46,422
- Robot, rip his arms and legs off.
- No!

996
01:18:46,507 --> 01:18:49,551
And you save his head for last.
I don't want him to miss anything!

997
01:18:49,636 --> 01:18:51,636
- Anything!
- No!

998
01:18:55,725 --> 01:18:58,477
- Fergie, you stay here.
- By myself?

999
01:18:58,561 --> 01:19:01,647
You'll need me to shut down
the Janus system. We're a team.

1000
01:19:01,731 --> 01:19:04,441
Granted, you do most of the work,
but we're still a team.

1001
01:19:04,526 --> 01:19:07,028
- I'll handle it, kid.
- I bring you luck.

1002
01:19:07,738 --> 01:19:10,657
- Luck?
- You are still alive, Dredd.

1003
01:19:11,075 --> 01:19:12,409
Hmm.

1004
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:31,095
I'm getting a signal.

1005
01:19:32,598 --> 01:19:35,727
It's close. It's moving closer!

1006
01:19:37,438 --> 01:19:39,063
Jesus Christ!

1007
01:19:39,606 --> 01:19:40,898
Get back!

1008
01:19:44,069 --> 01:19:45,486
No!

1009
01:19:48,324 --> 01:19:49,533
Dredd!

1010
01:19:58,293 --> 01:19:59,919
Drop the gun.

1011
01:20:02,797 --> 01:20:05,592
Robot, on the count of three,
break her neck.

1012
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:07,469
One, two...

1013
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:08,595
No!

1014
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:17,146
- Hershey?
- I'm still here.

1015
01:20:17,981 --> 01:20:21,359
How romantic. Step inside.

1016
01:20:33,623 --> 01:20:35,332
He looks a lot like you.

1017
01:20:35,416 --> 01:20:37,209
He is a lot like me.

1018
01:20:37,961 --> 01:20:40,129
I am nothing like you.

1019
01:20:40,589 --> 01:20:42,131
The only difference
between us, Joseph,

1020
01:20:42,174 --> 01:20:45,635
is you destroyed your life
to embrace the Law.

1021
01:20:46,637 --> 01:20:49,306
And I destroyed the Law to embrace life.

1022
01:20:52,519 --> 01:20:56,396
And speaking of life, send in the clones.

1023
01:21:01,986 --> 01:21:03,196
Behold!

1024
01:21:19,757 --> 01:21:22,216
This is where you were born.

1025
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:23,968
Feel that magic?

1026
01:21:25,221 --> 01:21:27,972
But you must've known all along

1027
01:21:29,392 --> 01:21:31,102
you were different.

1028
01:21:34,063 --> 01:21:39,025
Fergie, are you still alive?

1029
01:21:39,402 --> 01:21:42,030
Technically, yes.

1030
01:21:48,203 --> 01:21:50,581
Your brothers and your sisters.

1031
01:21:50,665 --> 01:21:52,666
Be born in two hours.

1032
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:56,671
One big, endless supply of perfection.

1033
01:21:58,631 --> 01:22:00,090
You know, we have a choice.

1034
01:22:00,175 --> 01:22:01,760
We can stand here right now

1035
01:22:01,845 --> 01:22:04,262
and create a whole race
of brainwashed morons,

1036
01:22:04,346 --> 01:22:05,805
and call them Judges.

1037
01:22:05,890 --> 01:22:08,474
Or we can create
some freethinking people.

1038
01:22:09,894 --> 01:22:11,520
We'll call them human.

1039
01:22:13,398 --> 01:22:14,773
Human.

1040
01:22:17,903 --> 01:22:20,279
You could never control yourself.

1041
01:22:21,616 --> 01:22:25,118
What makes you think you
can control these things?

1042
01:22:25,161 --> 01:22:26,953
'Cause you're in control.

1043
01:22:28,623 --> 01:22:30,707
You be head of the Council.

1044
01:22:31,125 --> 01:22:35,421
You choose,
and you choose quickly too.

1045
01:22:35,464 --> 01:22:40,259
I should've put you down myself,
personally!

1046
01:22:41,303 --> 01:22:43,054
You know, I never understood that.

1047
01:22:43,263 --> 01:22:47,351
Why did you judge me?
Why did you judge me?

1048
01:22:47,435 --> 01:22:49,477
- You killed innocent people.
- The means to an end.

1049
01:22:49,561 --> 01:22:51,563
- You started a massacre.
- I caused a revolution.

1050
01:22:51,648 --> 01:22:54,650
- You betrayed the Law!
- Law!

1051
01:22:54,692 --> 01:22:57,528
I betrayed this!

1052
01:22:57,613 --> 01:23:01,824
Your Council's experiment,
which failed in you!

1053
01:23:03,535 --> 01:23:05,203
I was your brother,
your blood, your friend.

1054
01:23:06,831 --> 01:23:08,706
Who betrayed who?

1055
01:23:08,791 --> 01:23:12,086
When are you gonna stop
being a goddamn slave and grow up?

1056
01:23:12,337 --> 01:23:14,296
That's your birthright, that's your family.

1057
01:23:14,339 --> 01:23:17,842
I'm your family.
I'm the only family you ever had!

1058
01:23:19,386 --> 01:23:20,761
Now choose!

1059
01:23:25,768 --> 01:23:28,354
The best thing you can do is kill me.

1060
01:23:29,855 --> 01:23:30,939
Why?

1061
01:23:31,023 --> 01:23:36,320
Because it's your only chance brother.

1062
01:23:37,864 --> 01:23:39,031
Fido!

1063
01:23:42,035 --> 01:23:44,705
Rip this bitch's arms and legs off.

1064
01:23:44,789 --> 01:23:47,249
- Save her pretty head for my brother.
- Don't do it!

1065
01:23:47,709 --> 01:23:49,126
Halt!

1066
01:23:50,586 --> 01:23:53,255
Rip his head off instead. Give it to her.

1067
01:23:58,220 --> 01:24:00,221
What's the matter with you?

1068
01:24:01,223 --> 01:24:02,348
Rico!

1069
01:24:06,187 --> 01:24:08,063
- Boy, is he pissed!
- Fergie!

1070
01:24:10,859 --> 01:24:12,026
Dredd!

1071
01:24:14,361 --> 01:24:16,740
- Get him, Dredd!
- Hang on, Fergie.

1072
01:24:21,912 --> 01:24:23,580
Hack you, asshole.

1073
01:24:25,916 --> 01:24:27,126
Rico!

1074
01:24:29,004 --> 01:24:31,588
Central, hatch that first set of clones.

1075
01:24:31,631 --> 01:24:33,674
The cloning process is not finished, Judge Rico.

1076
01:24:33,759 --> 01:24:36,135
The clones will be only 60% complete.

1077
01:24:36,219 --> 01:24:40,097
I need reinforcements.
Hatch the goddamn clones now!

1078
01:24:51,986 --> 01:24:54,654
Don't fight much, do you?

1079
01:25:32,656 --> 01:25:33,864
Bitch!

1080
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:36,826
It's Judge Bitch!

1081
01:26:25,796 --> 01:26:28,256
I'm the only one who never lied to you.

1082
01:26:28,716 --> 01:26:30,801
I'll be the judge of that.

1083
01:26:57,664 --> 01:27:01,417
Now, Joseph Dredd,
I hereby judge you.

1084
01:27:02,962 --> 01:27:07,883
To the charge of betraying
your flesh, guilty.

1085
01:27:07,926 --> 01:27:13,765
To the charge of being human,
when we could have been Gods, guilty.

1086
01:27:15,601 --> 01:27:17,100
The sentence is death.

1087
01:27:17,143 --> 01:27:18,603
Don't miss.

1088
01:27:19,730 --> 01:27:21,940
Lethal round is exhausted.

1089
01:27:25,654 --> 01:27:26,903
Signal flare!

1090
01:27:30,575 --> 01:27:32,159
Court is adjourned.

1091
01:27:45,425 --> 01:27:46,550
Dredd.

1092
01:28:03,611 --> 01:28:04,653
Give me your hand.

1093
01:28:05,739 --> 01:28:07,990
That's three times now, Dredd.

1094
01:28:21,338 --> 01:28:23,299
Stay in back, Hershey.

1095
01:28:27,512 --> 01:28:31,140
- Am I under arrest?
- That won't be necessary.

1096
01:28:31,182 --> 01:28:34,269
Central broadcast the Janus plan
after Griffin's death.

1097
01:28:34,353 --> 01:28:36,271
They all know the truth.

1098
01:28:36,522 --> 01:28:40,025
Judge Dredd, we have
to reconstitute the Council.

1099
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:44,780
We'd like you to consider
the first position of Chief Justice.

1100
01:28:46,325 --> 01:28:47,991
I'm a Street Judge.

1101
01:28:48,034 --> 01:28:51,829
And I'm very late for work.
Thank you, Olmeyer.

1102
01:28:51,872 --> 01:28:56,501
I am dying. I'm too young... Excuse me.

1103
01:28:56,544 --> 01:28:58,753
Oh, that's great! He gets all the credit.

1104
01:28:58,837 --> 01:29:00,005
Dredd?

1105
01:29:01,132 --> 01:29:02,715
I taught him everything he knows.

1106
01:29:03,008 --> 01:29:05,345
Dredd, that's it?

1107
01:29:08,097 --> 01:29:09,514
No good-bye?

1108
01:29:09,557 --> 01:29:11,309
Good-bye, Hershey.

1109
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:22,737
To tell you the truth,
I'm probably a much better kisser.

1110
01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:26,534
Ow! Okay, come on, let's go, will ya?
Can we swing by a cash machine?

1111
01:29:36,755 --> 01:29:38,922
Feels good to be human,
don't you think?

1112
01:29:38,964 --> 01:29:40,965
I knew you'd say that.

1113
01:30:27,810 --> 01:30:31,354
- Never say it's over
- Over

1114
01:30:31,439 --> 01:30:34,857
- Never say the end
- The end

1115
01:30:34,941 --> 01:30:37,236
- Anytime you stop
- You stop

1116
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:41,741
You start to fall

1117
01:30:41,825 --> 01:30:45,368
- Never say give up
- Give up

1118
01:30:45,453 --> 01:30:48,789
- Never say give in
- Give in

1119
01:30:48,832 --> 01:30:53,044
- Always have to fight to win
- To fight to win

1120
01:30:55,630 --> 01:30:59,176
- However much it hurts
- It hurts

1121
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:02,597
- However much it takes
- It takes

1122
01:31:02,681 --> 01:31:07,517
Believe that all your dreams
