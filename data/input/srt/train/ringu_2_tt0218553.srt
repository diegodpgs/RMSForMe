1
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.245
-Get the corpse from the well.
-Yes, sir.

2
00:00:56.096 --> 00:00:58.402
Mr Yamamura.

3
00:01:19.872 --> 00:01:25.782
Don't. I haven't seen her
since she was a child.

4
00:01:25.906 --> 00:01:29.451
The well was on Dr Ikuma's estate.

5
00:01:29.582 --> 00:01:34.287
It was sealed when they
sold the place 30 years ago...

6
00:01:34.417 --> 00:01:37.008
...and it was never opened after that.

7
00:01:37.134 --> 00:01:41.567
But that is Sadako.

8
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.918
There's no record of a "Sadako", not
in Dr Ikuma's or the mother's family.

9
00:01:48.043 --> 00:01:50.793
What happened to Dr Ikuma?

10
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.148
He died right after
the place was sold.

11
00:01:56.994 --> 00:02:00.778
I'm the only one left alive.

12
00:02:22.648 --> 00:02:27.399
Burn her! Dispose of the ashes
wherever you want.

13
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.228
I'm afraid that's not possible.

14
00:02:34.357 --> 00:02:37.629
It's a very strange case.

15
00:02:37.753 --> 00:02:43.743
One of the people who found her
is dead, and the other's vanished.

16
00:02:43.867 --> 00:02:48.890
And there's one more thing...
The time of death.

17
00:02:49.022 --> 00:02:55.250
According to the autopsy
she died only a year or two ago.

18
00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:57.568
What?

19
00:02:57.693 --> 00:03:03.922
That means that she was alive
down there the entire time...

20
00:03:04.047 --> 00:03:05.524
For 30 years.

21
00:04:16.254 --> 00:04:20.686
<i>Everyone's talking about
this "video curse".</i>

22
00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:23.367
<i>What happens in it?</i>

23
00:04:24.885 --> 00:04:28.431
<i>I've heard that it's a creepy woman-</i>

24
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:33.113
<i>-who tells you that you will die
in one week's time.</i>

25
00:04:33.237 --> 00:04:39.181
<i>They say she appears if you watch TV
late at night. Then the phone rings.</i>

26
00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:41.868
<i>TV? What channel?</i>

27
00:04:41.988 --> 00:04:47.978
<i>-Some localstation in Izu.
-Izu?</i>

28
00:04:48.102 --> 00:04:53.375
Do you really want to use this?

29
00:04:53.496 --> 00:04:55.610
Why not?

30
00:05:06.084 --> 00:05:11.277
You die if you don't
show it to someone within a week...

31
00:05:11.398 --> 00:05:16.024
We'll have to get someone
to say that on camera.

32
00:05:16.153 --> 00:05:20.427
-Still no word from Reiko?
-No.

33
00:05:20.549 --> 00:05:25.140
The police called about her.

34
00:05:26.583 --> 00:05:33.175
Is Asakawa Reiko here?

35
00:05:33.296 --> 00:05:37.887
No, not at the moment.

36
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.882
<i>Everyone's talking about
this "video curse".</i>

37
00:05:44.005 --> 00:05:45.834
<i>What happens in it?</i>

38
00:05:45.963 --> 00:05:50.669
<i>I've heard that it's a creepy woman-</i>

39
00:05:50.798 --> 00:05:57.061
<i>-who tells you that you will die
in one week's time.</i>

40
00:05:57.192 --> 00:05:59.987
Excuse me!

41
00:06:07.901 --> 00:06:11.527
Do you know what this is all about?

42
00:06:11.657 --> 00:06:15.044
We haven't heard from her.

43
00:06:17.052 --> 00:06:22.564
-A man named Takayama Ryuji died.
-Takayama?

44
00:06:22.686 --> 00:06:26.437
Ms Asakawa's ex-husband.

45
00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:48.055
The police have been here, too.
She's been gone for days.

46
00:06:48.181 --> 00:06:53.772
-Have they been inside?
-No. They never asked.

47
00:06:56.812 --> 00:06:59.165
Go ahead.

48
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.054
Ms Takano...

49
00:08:21.447 --> 00:08:23.117
What's that?

50
00:08:29.558 --> 00:08:31.945
A videotape?

51
00:08:48.819 --> 00:08:55.286
<i>Forgive me, father!
I had to save Yoichi.</i>

52
00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.401
Are you okay?

53
00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:10.147
She asked me about a video
when I saw her...

54
00:09:10.277 --> 00:09:16.460
She's a single mother, so they
don't assign her important stories.

55
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:20.858
That's right! Her boy!

56
00:09:20.987 --> 00:09:24.259
He was in school...

57
00:09:53.794 --> 00:09:57.465
<i>-Ms Asakawa?
-She's not here right now.</i>

58
00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:04.261
<i>This is the police. Ms Asakawa's
father was found dead this morning.</i>

59
00:10:15.292 --> 00:10:19.327
-Where's Mr Kadokura?
-Over there.

60
00:10:21.965 --> 00:10:24.079
-Sir?
-Yes?

61
00:10:24.203 --> 00:10:27.272
-Omuta, Shizuoka Police.
-Thanks for coming.

62
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:32.150
-Have you found the daughter?
-No.

63
00:10:32.275 --> 00:10:37.025
-The woman in the well?
-We're reconstructing the face.

64
00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:42.741
We're going to make a model
and ask around the area.

65
00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.889
He found the body.

66
00:10:54.572 --> 00:10:57.209
Hang on...

67
00:10:57.329 --> 00:11:00.239
Do you want to see him?

68
00:11:05.641 --> 00:11:09.471
People don't usually die like that.

69
00:11:39.487 --> 00:11:44.953
-Are you recording something?
-Yes.

70
00:11:45.081 --> 00:11:50.025
We're wondering if it
has anything to do with this note.

71
00:11:52.194 --> 00:11:56.422
Reiko, I got rid of the tape.
There's nothing to worry about now.

72
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.834
He's been absent
more than ten days.

73
00:12:29.956 --> 00:12:34.264
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

74
00:12:34.392 --> 00:12:37.937
Why are you looking for Reiko?

75
00:12:38.068 --> 00:12:43.137
I want to find out
why Professor Takayama died.

76
00:12:44.661 --> 00:12:49.491
I'll check around.
I'll call you if I find anything.

77
00:12:51.015 --> 00:12:52.969
Bye.

78
00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:57.667
<i>-Yes?
-It's the police.</i>

79
00:13:57.788 --> 00:14:02.334
<i>I know it's late, but I'd like to ask
about Takayama Ryuji.</i>

80
00:14:07.777 --> 00:14:12.608
-Ms Takano Mai? First on the scene?
-Yes.

81
00:14:12.732 --> 00:14:15.688
Can I come in?

82
00:14:15.809 --> 00:14:18.275
Please.

83
00:14:29.236 --> 00:14:34.021
That's right... Professor Takayama
taught math, didn't he?

84
00:14:34.151 --> 00:14:38.856
-And you are...?
-His assistant.

85
00:14:41.983 --> 00:14:48.688
Have you ever heard of
Yamamura Sadako?

86
00:14:48.816 --> 00:14:54.169
-No.
-Her mother Shizuko?

87
00:14:54.291 --> 00:14:57.802
-No.
-Ikuma Heihachiro?

88
00:14:57.927 --> 00:14:59.677
No.

89
00:15:02.283 --> 00:15:07.954
Takayama Ryuji and Asakawa Reiko
were looking for something, right?

90
00:15:12.153 --> 00:15:17.176
-I'm afraid I don't know.
-I see.

91
00:15:19.425 --> 00:15:24.733
Asakawa Reiko's father
was found dead today.

92
00:15:26.498 --> 00:15:32.886
In a similar state to Professor
Takayama. Do you know what I mean?

93
00:15:33.012 --> 00:15:35.807
Go away, please.

94
00:15:35.929 --> 00:15:42.634
They'd found a corpse in a well.
A woman who died a year or two ago.

95
00:15:42.762 --> 00:15:47.706
But that well was sealed
30 years ago.

96
00:15:47.837 --> 00:15:53.463
It's hard to imagine, right? Almost
30 years down there in the dark...

97
00:15:53.591 --> 00:15:56.148
Neither of the hands had nails.

98
00:15:56.268 --> 00:16:01.542
They were found in the sides
of the well, where she had tried...

99
00:16:01.663 --> 00:16:04.572
Go away!

100
00:16:06.378 --> 00:16:09.492
All right.

101
00:16:09.615 --> 00:16:14.525
Call me if you hear
where Asakawa Reiko is.

102
00:16:22.761 --> 00:16:27.592
I'm sorry.
It's just such a strange case.

103
00:16:29.435 --> 00:16:32.821
What's the "video" all about?

104
00:16:35.708 --> 00:16:36.662
I don't know.

105
00:16:53.051 --> 00:16:55.199
Nope...

106
00:17:48.195 --> 00:17:51.229
-Do you live around here, Professor?
-Yes.

107
00:17:51.352 --> 00:17:55.977
I can concentrate better here
than in my apartment.

108
00:18:24.838 --> 00:18:28.713
-We're rolling.
-Pick up where we left off.

109
00:18:28.834 --> 00:18:31.823
Three seconds...

110
00:18:31.951 --> 00:18:37.020
You have to copy it and show it
to someone within a week.

111
00:18:37.146 --> 00:18:40.101
If you don't, exactly one week later...

112
00:18:40.223 --> 00:18:44.848
So there was an original video
that people copied?

113
00:18:44.978 --> 00:18:48.092
Where did it come from?

114
00:18:48.215 --> 00:18:51.567
It was just there.

115
00:18:51.691 --> 00:18:55.317
Everyone has tapes
that they don't know what's on.

116
00:18:55.447 --> 00:18:58.005
One had this weird stuff on it.

117
00:18:58.125 --> 00:19:01.636
-How can you tell that it's that tape?
-You'll know.

118
00:19:01.761 --> 00:19:05.511
-Does anyone have this tape?
-I know people.

119
00:19:06.836 --> 00:19:12.348
They're scared, so they're all
showing it to each other.

120
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:15.028
Have you seen it?

121
00:19:19.303 --> 00:19:23.611
Can you get me a copy?

122
00:19:26.736 --> 00:19:28.804
Okay.

123
00:19:30.492 --> 00:19:32.799
Look...

124
00:19:39.803 --> 00:19:41.871
Excuse me.

125
00:19:42.001 --> 00:19:44.387
Work out a price.

126
00:19:47.995 --> 00:19:51.904
She was probably after these four.

127
00:19:55.627 --> 00:20:00.491
They all died exactly one week
after they watched the tape.

128
00:20:04.937 --> 00:20:07.324
It's hard to believe, right?

129
00:20:07.455 --> 00:20:11.364
This is Tomoko.
She was Ms Asakawa's niece.

130
00:20:11.491 --> 00:20:14.366
There was a friend with her...

131
00:20:14.488 --> 00:20:18.840
Kurahashi... Kurahashi Masami.

132
00:20:18.963 --> 00:20:22.032
What happened to her?

133
00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:28.070
She can't speak.
She's in the hospital at the university.

134
00:20:38.304 --> 00:20:41.690
The doctor can't talk about
a specific patient.

135
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:45.889
-You can only ask about his research.
-All right.

136
00:21:43.398 --> 00:21:45.956
This way, please.

137
00:22:09.612 --> 00:22:12.567
Ms Kurahashi?

138
00:22:17.604 --> 00:22:20.161
How are you feeling?

139
00:22:22.918 --> 00:22:27.544
Would you like to
sit outside for a while?

140
00:22:27.674 --> 00:22:31.504
The doctor said the air
would do you good.

141
00:22:44.377 --> 00:22:48.161
Are you still afraid of the TV?

142
00:22:48.293 --> 00:22:53.884
I'll bring a partition
so you won't have to see it.

143
00:22:54.007 --> 00:22:56.155
Okay?

144
00:22:57.723 --> 00:23:00.440
They're here, Doctor.

145
00:23:04.157 --> 00:23:08.351
Myname's Kawajiri. Have a seat.

146
00:23:14.906 --> 00:23:19.975
We put photos of our patients
in their files.

147
00:23:24.576 --> 00:23:28.850
-Do you know why?
-In case they run off.

148
00:23:28.972 --> 00:23:31.961
That's right.

149
00:23:32.089 --> 00:23:36.521
Illness can change people to the point
where their families don't know them.

150
00:23:36.644 --> 00:23:39.599
So we always take pictures.

151
00:23:39.721 --> 00:23:43.949
But when we photographed
this patient...

152
00:23:44.077 --> 00:23:47.827
...using an ordinary camera...

153
00:23:47.953 --> 00:23:51.180
...we came across something strange.

154
00:24:27.313 --> 00:24:30.143
It's called "spiritphotography".

155
00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:36.373
Something in a person's mind affects
the light. There have been many cases.

156
00:24:36.504 --> 00:24:39.493
Is that what's happened here?

157
00:24:39.621 --> 00:24:43.405
We tried just having
her hold the film...

158
00:24:54.086 --> 00:24:57.075
Do you see the character?

159
00:24:57.203 --> 00:24:59.157
SADA

160
00:25:04.995 --> 00:25:11.507
You probably think I'm crazy.
The entire university does.

161
00:25:12.507 --> 00:25:15.099
Did you know Takayama Ryuji?

162
00:25:15.225 --> 00:25:18.975
Yes. He was the only one
who would listen to me.

163
00:25:19.101 --> 00:25:23.374
He studied medicine
before he switched to math.

164
00:25:23.496 --> 00:25:26.849
Do you know he's dead?

165
00:25:26.973 --> 00:25:29.768
It was a real shame.

166
00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:33.276
Then why didn't you
attend his funeral?

167
00:26:10.609 --> 00:26:14.234
You can't see it, right?

168
00:26:19.919 --> 00:26:26.863
There's no need to rush.
Just take it nice and easy.

169
00:26:47.691 --> 00:26:50.442
What's wrong?

170
00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.388
Are you feeling ill?

171
00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:10.663
Ms Kurahashi...

172
00:28:46.731 --> 00:28:48.959
Get her out of here.

173
00:29:18.499 --> 00:29:20.692
Tomoko?

174
00:29:25.932 --> 00:29:28.727
Tomoko?

175
00:29:43.594 --> 00:29:46.230
Help me...

176
00:29:46.791 --> 00:29:49.222
Help me...

177
00:29:52.945 --> 00:29:55.979
Restrain her!

178
00:30:06.771 --> 00:30:09.282
Help me!

179
00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:41.009
They said that was
the first time she has spoken.

180
00:30:44.253 --> 00:30:48.799
Are you going to proceed
with Ms Asakawa's story?

181
00:30:48.928 --> 00:30:50.803
Yes.

182
00:30:50.926 --> 00:30:53.597
I wouldn't do that.

183
00:30:53.723 --> 00:30:56.519
Why not?

184
00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.754
I just wouldn't.

185
00:30:59.877 --> 00:31:03.071
Did the girl tell you anything?

186
00:31:04.912 --> 00:31:08.265
Wait!

187
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:10.854
I'm sorry.

188
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.751
Don't tell anyone.

189
00:32:21.035 --> 00:32:27.423
The power you have now
won't save anyone.

190
00:32:41.735 --> 00:32:43.962
<i>Yoichi!</i>

191
00:33:33.722 --> 00:33:36.358
Are you Yoichi?

192
00:33:49.786 --> 00:33:52.139
Where do you live?

193
00:34:10.725 --> 00:34:13.282
Can't you talk?

194
00:34:33.542 --> 00:34:36.007
Go in there.

195
00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:49.795
It's not much of a place. Have a seat.

196
00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:58.872
I want to go to school.
I'm hungry.

197
00:35:05.989 --> 00:35:08.376
Well?

198
00:35:10.225 --> 00:35:16.691
Do you remember Masami?
She was with Tomoko when she died.

199
00:35:18.217 --> 00:35:20.092
Yes.

200
00:35:20.215 --> 00:35:26.841
She passed a TV set at the hospital,
and something strange appeared.

201
00:35:29.126 --> 00:35:32.320
What was it?

202
00:35:32.442 --> 00:35:36.750
A well.
You could only see it for a second.

203
00:35:38.716 --> 00:35:41.352
Was that it?

204
00:35:41.473 --> 00:35:43.939
Yes.

205
00:35:51.703 --> 00:35:55.408
You've seen it too, haven't you?

206
00:35:55.539 --> 00:35:58.687
You'll be all right, if that's all.

207
00:35:58.816 --> 00:36:01.566
But I wouldn't look at it again.

208
00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:10.203
Masami can't speak either.

209
00:36:10.324 --> 00:36:13.631
So?

210
00:36:13.761 --> 00:36:17.067
If Yoichi goes on like this...

211
00:36:17.197 --> 00:36:20.903
So what should I do?
Lock him away in some hospital?

212
00:36:21.033 --> 00:36:24.181
What's it got to do with you?

213
00:36:28.506 --> 00:36:31.222
I'm sorry.

214
00:36:33.341 --> 00:36:36.136
Please leave.

215
00:36:48.566 --> 00:36:53.237
Can I come back
and see Yoichi sometime?

216
00:37:05.269 --> 00:37:07.905
Hi.

217
00:37:11.902 --> 00:37:13.936
Here.

218
00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:19.526
You got it? We said 20,000, right?

219
00:37:27.327 --> 00:37:32.157
I watched it last night.

220
00:37:34.399 --> 00:37:39.946
Mr Okazaki,
you'll watch it too, won't you?

221
00:37:40.074 --> 00:37:45.586
Sure. There's no point if I don't.

222
00:37:45.708 --> 00:37:47.856
Do you promise?

223
00:37:50.823 --> 00:37:54.414
Of course. Trust me!

224
00:38:01.692 --> 00:38:04.726
Hang on. The money...

225
00:38:07.686 --> 00:38:10.436
Don't forget.

226
00:38:38.974 --> 00:38:42.281
Nice catch.

227
00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:45.724
Here it comes.

228
00:38:56.277 --> 00:39:01.062
Are you studying that already?

229
00:39:05.827 --> 00:39:11.454
Why were you at the station
the other day?

230
00:39:11.582 --> 00:39:14.729
Was your mom angry?

231
00:39:20.373 --> 00:39:22.930
Was there someone there?

232
00:39:37.116 --> 00:39:39.388
The woman with long hair.

233
00:39:47.665 --> 00:39:49.893
Let's eat.

234
00:39:53.699 --> 00:39:56.494
Go and wash your hands.

235
00:40:11.361 --> 00:40:19.271
I think Yoichi won't speak
because he blames me.

236
00:40:19.393 --> 00:40:23.780
That's not true.

237
00:40:23.909 --> 00:40:30.137
After we left my dad's place, the TV
would come on when Yoichi came near.

238
00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:36.015
Could you talk to Dr Kawajiri?

239
00:40:36.136 --> 00:40:40.364
If he's like Tomoko's friend Masami...

240
00:40:53.039 --> 00:40:56.267
You've seen Asakawa Reiko.

241
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:08.334
-I didn't call him.
-A reporter asked us about a patient.

242
00:41:08.464 --> 00:41:12.055
He'll be here soon.

243
00:41:14.937 --> 00:41:20.563
We're going to try an experiment.
It might help the boy, too.

244
00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:24.239
Come in.

245
00:41:26.446 --> 00:41:28.673
This way.

246
00:41:56.975 --> 00:41:59.964
What are you going to do?

247
00:42:04.008 --> 00:42:07.235
This is tap water.

248
00:42:10.721 --> 00:42:13.152
The paper can absorb...

249
00:42:17.274 --> 00:42:19.832
...about that much.

250
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:26.181
Just like before.
Concentrate on the water.

251
00:42:37.894 --> 00:42:40.485
That's good.

252
00:42:56.994 --> 00:42:59.631
The water has changed.

253
00:42:59.751 --> 00:43:03.457
Some kind of energy
has gone from her to the water.

254
00:43:03.588 --> 00:43:06.418
We can explain the film
the same way.

255
00:43:06.545 --> 00:43:12.886
It's energytransfer. In time
all the energy should be transferred.

256
00:43:13.817 --> 00:43:16.612
We're going to try that now.

257
00:43:21.969 --> 00:43:24.639
Have a seat.

258
00:43:24.766 --> 00:43:28.312
-Are you going to record this?
-Yes. Just like with the pictures.

259
00:43:28.443 --> 00:43:31.636
-But you'll see the well.
-A well?

260
00:43:31.759 --> 00:43:36.146
-Everyone who sees it dies.
-You're still alive.

261
00:43:36.275 --> 00:43:39.468
Hayashi...- Mr Okazaki.

262
00:43:39.591 --> 00:43:44.183
This is a blank tape.
Can you set it up?

263
00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:56.322
Masami! This is dangerous.

264
00:43:56.454 --> 00:43:59.727
If everyone sees it...

265
00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:03.326
There's something in my head.

266
00:44:11.719 --> 00:44:14.355
Quick! The tape.

267
00:44:17.793 --> 00:44:21.225
Even if we get it on tape,
videos don't kill.

268
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:27.578
Fear can kill. Prove that,
and the energy will dissipate.

269
00:44:29.381 --> 00:44:32.927
-You can leave if you want to.
-No.

270
00:44:39.970 --> 00:44:42.402
Begin.

271
00:44:51.878 --> 00:44:56.106
Just like with the photo film.
Relax and look at the camera.

272
00:45:23.966 --> 00:45:26.319
What's that sound?

273
00:45:53.736 --> 00:45:55.406
Who's that?

274
00:46:05.444 --> 00:46:08.036
Doctor!

275
00:46:11.318 --> 00:46:13.272
Ms Kurahashi!

276
00:46:34.255 --> 00:46:37.085
What are you doing?

277
00:46:52.557 --> 00:46:55.114
Some girl called for you...

278
00:46:55.234 --> 00:46:59.939
She said that it's been a week.
Was it the girl with the tape?

279
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:03.422
Right. I'll give her a call.

280
00:47:03.546 --> 00:47:05.932
Good night.

281
00:47:32.277 --> 00:47:36.471
<i>-Sawaguchi.
-Is this Kanae?</i>

282
00:47:36.592 --> 00:47:39.865
<i>-Yes.
-It's Okazaki.</i>

283
00:47:39.989 --> 00:47:46.218
<i>-I've watched the tape.
-Great! I was really scared.</i>

284
00:47:46.343 --> 00:47:48.570
Don't you trust me?

285
00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:53.485
<i>It was almost time...</i>

286
00:47:53.615 --> 00:47:59.207
You know that strange woman...

287
00:47:59.329 --> 00:48:03.637
<i>The one in the mirror?</i>

288
00:48:06.442 --> 00:48:10.750
<i>-Hello?
-Yes, that's the one.</i>

289
00:48:10.878 --> 00:48:14.913
<i>Didn't it look like she changed
into a child for a second?</i>

290
00:48:15.034 --> 00:48:19.625
<i>Just before you could see the well.</i>

291
00:48:19.749 --> 00:48:22.624
Where's the tape now?

292
00:48:22.746 --> 00:48:26.974
<i>I got rid of it. It's too dangerous.</i>

293
00:48:27.101 --> 00:48:30.249
Nobody else should see it.

294
00:48:30.378 --> 00:48:37.163
<i>But you have to show it to someone!</i>

295
00:48:37.811 --> 00:48:44.198
<i>You have to, Mr Okazaki.
I don't want you to die.</i>

296
00:48:45.643 --> 00:48:48.359
All right.

297
00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:51.514
<i>See you, then.</i>

298
00:49:42.106 --> 00:49:45.334
The woman in the mirror...

299
00:49:54.813 --> 00:49:57.722
Reporter Dies Witnessing Psychic Test

300
00:50:01.087 --> 00:50:07.838
The test destroyed the reputation
of a certain Dr Ikuma Heihachiro.

301
00:50:09.758 --> 00:50:15.463
The Fatal Demonstration
Yamamura Shizuko and Dr Ikuma

302
00:50:16.871 --> 00:50:19.336
Shizuko...

303
00:50:34.253 --> 00:50:37.606
You can't just will someone dead.

304
00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:41.844
Dr Ikuma spoke about
how intention is a living thing...

305
00:50:41.966 --> 00:50:48.114
...and how energy of thought
could take physical form.

306
00:50:49.438 --> 00:50:53.268
30 years in a well...

307
00:50:53.394 --> 00:50:56.985
30 years of concentrated thought...

308
00:50:57.110 --> 00:50:59.497
...wanting revenge.

309
00:50:59.628 --> 00:51:02.855
We've all seen it.

310
00:51:04.503 --> 00:51:10.447
Did Takayama and Ms Asakawa's
father see it before they died?

311
00:51:12.695 --> 00:51:15.490
Why the father?

312
00:51:18.249 --> 00:51:21.477
Did her boy see it?

313
00:51:25.482 --> 00:51:28.232
Him, too?

314
00:51:28.359 --> 00:51:33.030
Just like the girl.

315
00:51:33.154 --> 00:51:39.018
This can't go on.
Where's Ms Asakawa? Tell me!

316
00:51:46.341 --> 00:51:48.693
Yes?

317
00:52:17.349 --> 00:52:20.497
Kanae!

318
00:52:20.626 --> 00:52:24.376
-Kanae!
-Come with me.

319
00:53:10.336 --> 00:53:16.962
We just want to ask a few questions.
Don't worry.

320
00:53:19.007 --> 00:53:22.235
Just a minute...

321
00:53:43.942 --> 00:53:46.578
<i>Get away from here!</i>

322
00:53:49.457 --> 00:53:52.287
<i>Run!</i>

323
00:53:53.652 --> 00:53:57.039
<i>Can't you hear me? Run!</i>

324
00:54:01.604 --> 00:54:03.911
What's wrong?

325
00:54:06.399 --> 00:54:08.070
Mom!

326
00:54:09.516 --> 00:54:11.630
Yoichi!

327
00:54:29.536 --> 00:54:31.923
Freak!

328
00:54:33.972 --> 00:54:38.085
-Freak!
-Murderer!

329
00:54:38.207 --> 00:54:39.958
Freak!

330
00:55:13.572 --> 00:55:17.447
Yoichi! Yoichi!

331
00:55:20.045 --> 00:55:22.920
Yoichi!

332
00:55:31.793 --> 00:55:34.544
Dad?

333
00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:37.538
Dad!

334
00:55:41.823 --> 00:55:45.529
We didn't save Yoichi?

335
00:55:48.337 --> 00:55:53.042
Your child isn't Yoichi anymore.

336
00:56:50.754 --> 00:56:54.902
<i>Yoichi...</i>

337
00:57:02.262 --> 00:57:04.932
<i>Yoichi...</i>

338
00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:26.866
No!

339
00:57:32.791 --> 00:57:34.939
Stop it!

340
00:57:58.925 --> 00:58:01.312
<i>Okay.</i>

341
00:58:39.484 --> 00:58:42.757
Why won't this erase?

342
01:00:29.693 --> 01:00:32.250
<i>Who did the story start with?</i>

343
01:00:32.370 --> 01:00:35.882
<i>It never really starts with anyone.</i>

344
01:00:36.007 --> 01:00:41.473
<i>People get anxious,
and rumors start to fly.</i>

345
01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:45.788
Professor?

346
01:00:45.917 --> 01:00:48.382
What's wrong?

347
01:00:50.792 --> 01:00:53.428
Let's go.

348
01:01:16.166 --> 01:01:18.961
Does it look like her?

349
01:01:19.083 --> 01:01:23.868
Yes...just as strange.

350
01:01:25.996 --> 01:01:29.065
We'll take some pictures.

351
01:01:44.697 --> 01:01:47.414
That's good.

352
01:03:05.096 --> 01:03:09.165
Sadako! Why did you leave me alive?

353
01:03:09.292 --> 01:03:14.997
I was the one who made you
and your mother into a freak show!

354
01:03:22.639 --> 01:03:27.264
Do you want me
to return you to the sea?

355
01:03:35.825 --> 01:03:38.973
Is that it?

356
01:04:39.122 --> 01:04:43.157
Do you know
the Yamamuras in Sashikiji?

357
01:04:43.277 --> 01:04:46.073
There are lots of Yamamuras
around here.

358
01:04:46.194 --> 01:04:51.343
A woman named Shizuko lived here.

359
01:04:51.469 --> 01:04:54.344
Oh, there...

360
01:05:01.219 --> 01:05:04.174
THE YAMAMURA INN

361
01:05:14.526 --> 01:05:17.196
Hello?

362
01:05:29.231 --> 01:05:31.789
This way.

363
01:06:52.707 --> 01:06:57.856
-I'm sorry. Did I wake you up?
-No.

364
01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:05.684
-Can you promise me something?
-What?

365
01:07:06.933 --> 01:07:13.718
Don't do that again,
no matter what happens.

366
01:07:13.846 --> 01:07:18.437
It's really scary. Okay?

367
01:07:21.198 --> 01:07:24.631
Are you on my side?

368
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:34.494
Of course I am.

369
01:07:38.701 --> 01:07:41.087
Okay.

370
01:09:05.373 --> 01:09:09.487
I put Sadako in the sea.

371
01:09:09.609 --> 01:09:14.120
It's the only thing I could do.

372
01:09:14.244 --> 01:09:20.074
That's what Shizuko did with her.

373
01:09:20.198 --> 01:09:26.347
She went off alone
when she went into labor.

374
01:09:26.472 --> 01:09:32.938
She came home with a flat stomach,
saying she'd put the baby in the sea.

375
01:09:35.263 --> 01:09:41.048
But the next day she came back,
and the child was with her.

376
01:09:46.652 --> 01:09:49.527
What's that sound?

377
01:09:49.649 --> 01:09:53.081
It's the cave where Sadako was born.

378
01:10:23.375 --> 01:10:26.011
"The River of Offering".

379
01:10:26.132 --> 01:10:32.439
Unwanted children were put here,
so the tide would take them.

380
01:10:41.676 --> 01:10:44.904
Who was Sadako's father?

381
01:11:10.207 --> 01:11:12.082
Hello?

382
01:11:14.043 --> 01:11:19.795
-Yes?
-Is Ms Takano Mai staying here?

383
01:11:19.918 --> 01:11:23.793
No.

384
01:11:23.914 --> 01:11:28.107
-Well, at least you have vacancies...
-Sir!

385
01:12:33.124 --> 01:12:35.589
Sadako!

386
01:13:28.388 --> 01:13:31.775
You're dead!

387
01:13:43.373 --> 01:13:46.089
<i>You're dead!</i>

388
01:14:18.498 --> 01:14:21.691
You're safe!

389
01:14:48.188 --> 01:14:51.779
Do you remember what you
dreamt about last night?

390
01:14:53.183 --> 01:14:56.217
Okay. Think of your mother.

391
01:15:09.446 --> 01:15:12.004
That's good.

392
01:15:48.247 --> 01:15:51.395
Can I speak to you?

393
01:15:57.718 --> 01:16:01.229
The thing that controls him is anger.

394
01:16:01.354 --> 01:16:06.025
His anger summons her.
He can't control it.

395
01:16:07.548 --> 01:16:12.412
My equipmentis on its way.
I'll try to make Sadako disappear.

396
01:16:13.062 --> 01:16:16.892
There are no ghosts, no next world.

397
01:16:17.018 --> 01:16:20.371
Despite what Takayama said.

398
01:16:20.495 --> 01:16:24.279
Will Yoichi be strong enough?

399
01:16:24.411 --> 01:16:28.877
What's your suggestion?
What if the police show up?

400
01:16:29.006 --> 01:16:33.916
He can channel the energy.
He's the best medium.

401
01:16:36.518 --> 01:16:39.189
I'll do it.

402
01:16:44.710 --> 01:16:49.859
-Are you as strong as Takayama?
-Yes.

403
01:16:49.985 --> 01:16:54.770
That doesn't mean
you'll be better than the boy.

404
01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:58.969
What if I saw the video?

405
01:16:59.096 --> 01:17:02.801
All right. All we need now is water.

406
01:17:02.932 --> 01:17:05.238
Water?

407
01:17:05.369 --> 01:17:07.927
Sea water doesn't permeate as well.

408
01:17:08.047 --> 01:17:12.672
We need fresh water
to absorb Sadako's bitterness.

409
01:17:45.009 --> 01:17:51.715
Guide the energy into the water.
It will dissolve there.

410
01:17:51.842 --> 01:17:54.559
And Sadako will disappear...

411
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:06.898
-All right?
-Yes.

412
01:18:09.265 --> 01:18:12.538
Take your places.

413
01:18:30.044 --> 01:18:34.397
Remember that I'm on your side.

414
01:19:25.068 --> 01:19:27.819
Begin.

415
01:19:29.184 --> 01:19:32.014
Close your eyes.

416
01:19:32.141 --> 01:19:37.256
Remember what you saw.
What did you see?

417
01:19:57.995 --> 01:20:01.507
Yes! Your father and mother are dead.

418
01:20:01.632 --> 01:20:05.337
You're all alone. What did you see?

419
01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:19.602
It's that woman's fault
your mother died.

420
01:20:19.733 --> 01:20:23.802
She betrayed your mother.

421
01:20:26.047 --> 01:20:30.241
That's right. It's my fault.

422
01:21:03.849 --> 01:21:06.360
Good! Just like that.

423
01:21:26.626 --> 01:21:29.091
Dr Kawajiri! What's that?

424
01:21:37.895 --> 01:21:41.361
I can see into the next world.

425
01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:55.913
Sadako...

426
01:22:08.504 --> 01:22:12.049
Sadako...

427
01:22:15.297 --> 01:22:18.172
Take me!

428
01:22:18.294 --> 01:22:21.999
Please.

429
01:22:22.130 --> 01:22:24.960
Take me...

430
01:22:25.087 --> 01:22:29.042
...and put an end to this!

431
01:22:52.779 --> 01:22:55.211
No!

432
01:23:17.234 --> 01:23:20.906
Are you okay?

433
01:23:40.371 --> 01:23:42.883
Don't let go.

434
01:23:55.076 --> 01:23:57.349
Let me fall.

435
01:24:25.805 --> 01:24:30.477
Grab the wall. I can't hold you.

436
01:24:44.347 --> 01:24:47.494
Grab the wall!

437
01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:54.371
Ms Takano...

438
01:24:54.496 --> 01:24:58.042
It's all right. No more!

439
01:25:07.403 --> 01:25:10.517
Yoichi!

440
01:25:18.113 --> 01:25:20.988
Yoichi?

441
01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:24.019
Yoichi!

442
01:26:00.190 --> 01:26:03.384
Take him.

443
01:26:06.224 --> 01:26:08.940
Professor...

444
01:26:15.055 --> 01:26:20.488
Yoichi, give me your fear.

445
01:26:22.208 --> 01:26:24.924
Give it to me!

446
01:26:28.322 --> 01:26:31.152
Give it to me!

447
01:27:11.838 --> 01:27:15.270
Climb the rope!

448
01:27:17.752 --> 01:27:20.139
Don't look back.

449
01:28:41.468 --> 01:28:46.332
Help me...

450
01:28:54.974 --> 01:28:59.485
Why are you the only one saved?

451
01:30:04.104 --> 01:30:07.093
Are you still scared?

452
01:30:09.819 --> 01:30:15.206
-No. Are you?
-Me?

453
01:30:26.162 --> 01:30:29.390
A little bit.

454
01:30:39.868 --> 01:30:42.857
How's Okazaki doing?

455
01:30:42.985 --> 01:30:48.008
-He's still in the hospital.
-The hospital?

456
01:30:52.176 --> 01:30:56.722
Where's the key for this?

457
01:30:59.409 --> 01:31:02.522
Isn't it this one?

458
01:31:06.881 --> 01:31:12.472
Mr Okazaki. I need to take
your picture. Can you look this way?

459
01:31:18.469 --> 01:31:22.015
Mr Okazaki? Look this way.

460
01:31:24.263 --> 01:31:26.411
There you go.

461
01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:30.087
Thanks.
