1
00:00:37,813 --> 00:00:39,940
You know the problem with Hollywood?

2
00:00:40,148 --> 00:00:44,444
They make shit. Unbelievable,
unremarkable shit.

3
00:00:44,653 --> 00:00:47,280
I'm not some wannabe filmmaker...

4
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,326
...searching for existentialism through
a haze of bong smoke.

5
00:00:51,535 --> 00:00:54,955
No, it's easy to pick apart bad acting,
shortsighted directing...

6
00:00:55,163 --> 00:00:59,125
...and a moronic stringing together
of words the studios term as prose.

7
00:00:59,334 --> 00:01:03,463
No, I'm talking about
the lack of realism. Realism.

8
00:01:03,672 --> 00:01:07,676
Not a pervasive element
in modern American cinematic vision.

9
00:01:08,593 --> 00:01:13,681
Take Dog Day Afternoon, for example.
Arguably Pacino's best work.

10
00:01:13,848 --> 00:01:18,478
Short of Scarface and
Godfather Part I, of course.

11
00:01:18,686 --> 00:01:22,023
Masterpiece of directing,
easily Lumet's best.

12
00:01:23,525 --> 00:01:28,613
The cinematography, the acting,
the screenplay, all topnotch. But...

13
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:39,374
...they didn't push the envelope.

14
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:45,338
What if, in Dog Day Sonny wanted to
get away with it? Really wanted that.

15
00:01:46,464 --> 00:01:51,010
Now this is the tricky part. What if
he started killing hostages right away?

16
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:53,054
No mercy, no quarter.

17
00:01:53,763 --> 00:01:59,352
"Meet our demands or the pretty blond
gets it in the head. " Bam, splat.

18
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,230
What, still no bus? Come on.

19
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:06,192
How many innocent victims would it take
for the city...

20
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,861
...to reverse its policy
on hostages?

21
00:02:09,111 --> 00:02:14,325
And this is 1966. There's no CNN.
There's no CNBC. There's no Internet.

22
00:02:16,327 --> 00:02:20,289
Fast-forward to today.
Present time, same situation.

23
00:02:20,498 --> 00:02:24,126
How quickly would the media
make a frenzy? In hours.

24
00:02:24,335 --> 00:02:28,172
It would be the biggest story from
Boston to Budapest.

25
00:02:29,256 --> 00:02:31,133
Ten hostages die.

26
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,552
Twenty, thirty.

27
00:02:33,761 --> 00:02:36,722
Relentless. Bam, bim.
One after another.

28
00:02:37,806 --> 00:02:43,812
All on hi-def, computer-enhanced.
You can almost taste the brain matter.

29
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:46,857
All for what? A bus, a plane?

30
00:02:47,483 --> 00:02:50,736
A couple million dollars
that's federally insured?

31
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,493
I don't think so, but...

32
00:02:57,826 --> 00:02:59,703
...just a thought.

33
00:03:00,454 --> 00:03:02,289
I mean, it's not...

34
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,752
...within the realm of
conventional cinema, but...

35
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,131
...what if?

36
00:03:13,592 --> 00:03:17,387
- There's a problem with that movie.
- Really?

37
00:03:17,596 --> 00:03:20,724
- It wouldn't work.
- How come?

38
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:26,063
- Audiences love happy endings.
- Pacino escapes with the money.

39
00:03:26,271 --> 00:03:30,233
Boyfriend gets a sex change.
Live happily ever after.

40
00:03:30,442 --> 00:03:32,402
- No?
- No.

41
00:03:33,945 --> 00:03:35,447
Homophobia.

42
00:03:35,655 --> 00:03:38,575
Bad guy can't win.
It's a morality tale.

43
00:03:38,784 --> 00:03:41,912
One way or the other,
he's gotta go down.

44
00:03:44,122 --> 00:03:48,877
Well, life is stranger
than fiction sometimes.

45
00:03:55,508 --> 00:03:58,970
You know, guys, I gotta go.

46
00:03:59,512 --> 00:04:00,972
Gotta jet.

47
00:04:01,932 --> 00:04:03,600
Thanks for the coffee.

48
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,530
Stan. Time to go to work.
You coming?

49
00:04:21,576 --> 00:04:24,662
Move. I won't say it again.

50
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,870
I have a clear shot.

51
00:05:06,037 --> 00:05:08,164
Shooters, stand by.

52
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,252
Okay. Now what?

53
00:05:14,462 --> 00:05:17,048
Don't worry, folks, it's almost over.
Is she done?

54
00:05:17,298 --> 00:05:19,216
- She's done.
- Move her out.

55
00:05:21,677 --> 00:05:26,474
Don't worry, you'll be fine.
You'll be back before you know it.

56
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:32,313
Turn the fuck around.

57
00:05:34,482 --> 00:05:37,568
Rescue team, let's go.
Who's on the roof?

58
00:05:37,777 --> 00:05:41,030
All shooters, you are holding
for command.

59
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:48,954
You're doing good. Behave yourself.
Look over there, and there.

60
00:05:49,205 --> 00:05:50,831
All prepare their shot.

61
00:05:51,081 --> 00:05:54,126
- What are you doing?
- I'm handling this!

62
00:05:54,376 --> 00:05:57,504
Don't fuck with this guy!
You'll get these people killed!

63
00:05:57,713 --> 00:06:01,300
We got two teams on the roof.
We got a team over there.

64
00:06:01,508 --> 00:06:04,386
Double this team up.
That's your best angle.

65
00:06:04,595 --> 00:06:06,722
Don't talk. Just listen.

66
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:11,894
Each of the 22 hostages is wrapped
with 20 pounds of C-4 explosives.

67
00:06:12,102 --> 00:06:16,398
They're also taped with 15 pounds
of stainless steel ball bearings.

68
00:06:16,607 --> 00:06:19,943
Which makes them the world's
largest claymore mines.

69
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,112
They got the green light.

70
00:06:22,321 --> 00:06:24,615
I got this guy on the phone!

71
00:06:24,781 --> 00:06:27,492
I'm done playing with this asshole!

72
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:32,956
Around their necks are radio-frequency
electronic dog collars.

73
00:06:33,165 --> 00:06:37,502
Dog walks out of the yard, gets the
shit shocked out of him. Same here.

74
00:06:37,711 --> 00:06:40,964
This bank is their yard,
so don't fuck with me.

75
00:06:41,256 --> 00:06:45,260
Johnson, you and your partner move up
between those vehicles.

76
00:06:48,096 --> 00:06:50,891
- Stand down!
- Get back!

77
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:53,518
- Get back!
- Officer, stand down now!

78
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:59,774
He's gonna shoot!
He's gonna shoot!

79
00:07:03,653 --> 00:07:04,696
Shit.

80
00:07:07,198 --> 00:07:08,283
Get her!

81
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:09,576
Go!

82
00:07:10,327 --> 00:07:11,995
No! Release the hostage!

83
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:14,539
No! Release the hostage!

84
00:07:14,831 --> 00:07:17,167
She's gone. Take cover!

85
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,923
No, no! Let her go!
Let her go!

86
00:07:24,549 --> 00:07:26,342
Release the hostage!

87
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,221
Help me!

88
00:07:30,805 --> 00:07:32,682
Let her go. Let her go!

89
00:07:35,351 --> 00:07:37,854
- Jesus.
- Shit! You guys, come on!

90
00:08:46,714 --> 00:08:49,758
- How long will you be here?
- One week.

91
00:08:49,925 --> 00:08:53,220
- Business or pleasure?
- Hopefully both.

92
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:56,974
- What type of work do you do?
- I'm a consultant.

93
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:02,271
Excuse me.

94
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:07,151
Could you be careful with that?
That's expensive equipment.

95
00:09:26,587 --> 00:09:29,006
- How long will this take?
- A few minutes.

96
00:09:29,214 --> 00:09:31,884
Sit down, relax.
I'll be right back.

97
00:09:32,092 --> 00:09:33,927
A few minutes, huh?

98
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:08,086
Hey, where's he going?

99
00:10:11,464 --> 00:10:13,800
It's going up. Stairs.

100
00:10:39,701 --> 00:10:41,995
Sir, could you please-?

101
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,292
Easy, easy.

102
00:10:49,961 --> 00:10:51,671
This better be important.

103
00:10:51,838 --> 00:10:54,674
Wouldn't have asked you
otherwise, senator.

104
00:10:56,342 --> 00:11:01,514
We just received word that Axl Torvalds
was intercepted entering the U.S.

105
00:11:01,723 --> 00:11:04,809
- When was this?
- Within the last two hours.

106
00:11:05,017 --> 00:11:09,188
According to my FBI source,
he was nabbed in customs at LAX.

107
00:11:09,397 --> 00:11:12,108
- They know he's working for us?
- It's unlikely.

108
00:11:12,316 --> 00:11:16,070
It was a routine check.
Torvalds freaked out. They got lucky.

109
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,781
This ain't good.
What do the feds know?

110
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,742
Nothing yet.
He's refusing to speak English.

111
00:11:21,909 --> 00:11:25,204
The Finnish consulate has contacted
the State Department.

112
00:11:25,413 --> 00:11:30,668
- So we haven't been compromised?
- I'm not sure. I'm working on that.

113
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:35,756
You better get sure because someone's
cock will end up on the block...

114
00:11:35,923 --> 00:11:37,883
...and it won't be mine.

115
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:41,387
I understand, senator.

116
00:11:42,596 --> 00:11:44,348
There you go.

117
00:12:24,638 --> 00:12:25,764
Well, well, well.

118
00:12:30,477 --> 00:12:32,729
Who are you supposed to be?

119
00:12:34,648 --> 00:12:37,734
- I'm Ginger.
- Ginger, huh?

120
00:12:38,485 --> 00:12:40,362
Where's Gilligan?

121
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:50,247
For someone the NSA once listed as the
most dangerous hacker in America...

122
00:12:50,455 --> 00:12:53,250
...you sure don't look like much.

123
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,043
Surprised?

124
00:12:56,336 --> 00:12:58,797
I know everything about you, Stan.

125
00:13:03,343 --> 00:13:05,470
What are you selling again?

126
00:13:07,055 --> 00:13:09,516
My employer wants to meet you.

127
00:13:11,017 --> 00:13:13,520
- Shit.
- You're not too good at golf.

128
00:13:13,812 --> 00:13:15,897
You're fucking up my chi.

129
00:13:16,898 --> 00:13:18,400
Let me have that.

130
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:49,305
This is not a nice place
you got here, Stan.

131
00:13:53,893 --> 00:13:57,981
Here 5 minutes, and I already
feel sorry for myself.

132
00:13:58,398 --> 00:14:03,069
You're wasting your time. I touch
a computer, I go back to Leavenworth.

133
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:06,072
Do not pass Go, do not collect $200.

134
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:15,039
If I knew you were coming,
I might have cleaned up.

135
00:14:15,415 --> 00:14:18,793
I'm not here to suck
your dick, Stanley.

136
00:14:28,553 --> 00:14:31,430
He'll pay you just to meet you.

137
00:14:39,772 --> 00:14:41,732
I gotta go to work.

138
00:14:43,234 --> 00:14:44,443
Right.

139
00:14:44,652 --> 00:14:47,738
Great work greasing pump jacks.

140
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,036
So...

141
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:57,331
...spoke to Holly lately?

142
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,382
Shit!

143
00:15:23,565 --> 00:15:24,566
Hello?

144
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:28,153
Melissa. Is Holly home?

145
00:15:31,824 --> 00:15:33,951
Why are you calling here?

146
00:15:35,077 --> 00:15:39,998
- I just want to talk with Holly.
- It's Saturday. She's at soccer.

147
00:15:42,334 --> 00:15:44,962
It's illegal for you to talk to her.

148
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:49,174
Don't do this, Mel.
It's not good for Holly.

149
00:15:49,841 --> 00:15:52,844
How would you know
what's good for my daughter?

150
00:15:53,011 --> 00:15:55,847
You spent the last two years
in prison.

151
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:59,643
- Mel.
- Stop calling me that, Stanley.

152
00:15:59,851 --> 00:16:03,647
Look, I just...
I just want to see my baby.

153
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,984
Well, she doesn't want
to see you, Stanley.

154
00:16:08,193 --> 00:16:11,154
And I swear, if you try
to contact her...

155
00:16:11,363 --> 00:16:14,282
...I'll have you thrown
in a hole so dark...

156
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:17,285
...Leavenworth will seem like
two weeks in Vegas...

157
00:16:17,536 --> 00:16:19,913
...during which I will personally...

158
00:16:20,121 --> 00:16:24,042
...pay two skinheads to
make a playground out of your ass.

159
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:26,378
You can take the girl out of
the trailer park...

160
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,964
...but can't take the trailer park
out of the girl.

161
00:16:29,172 --> 00:16:33,134
I will not let myself be manipulated
by you, Stanley.

162
00:16:34,219 --> 00:16:35,637
Larry's her father now.

163
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,640
Larry's the porn king of
Southern Calif-

164
00:16:38,848 --> 00:16:41,684
Larry is a film financier.

165
00:16:41,893 --> 00:16:46,564
The films he chooses are for profit
and none of your business.

166
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:51,653
Get help. Get into a program,
get a therapist, get a dog.

167
00:16:51,861 --> 00:16:54,906
But whatever you do,
stay away from my child.

168
00:16:55,114 --> 00:17:00,453
- Your child? She's our child.
- She will never be your child.

169
00:17:00,662 --> 00:17:02,538
Forget Holly.

170
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:13,758
What are you still doing here?

171
00:17:15,885 --> 00:17:19,013
Look, I'm beginning to
lose my sense of humor.

172
00:17:19,222 --> 00:17:21,015
Then I'll cut to the chase.

173
00:17:21,224 --> 00:17:24,811
If you want your daughter back,
you better listen up.

174
00:17:25,061 --> 00:17:29,565
Unless you want to stay here
in this loser existence...

175
00:17:29,774 --> 00:17:35,488
...while your daughter grows up to be a
fluffer in her new daddy's videos.

176
00:17:36,113 --> 00:17:40,785
Please don't confuse your own childhood
with my daughter's.

177
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,287
And look at your situation, Stanley.

178
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:48,501
For the past 20 months, you've
been in and out of court 6 times?

179
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:51,420
Each time your case was thrown out.

180
00:17:53,756 --> 00:17:57,176
Situation doesn't
look good, sweetheart.

181
00:17:58,803 --> 00:18:03,682
How much money would it cost to hire
the best family lawyer in the country?

182
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:05,935
A lot. Come here.

183
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,270
Come here.

184
00:18:10,105 --> 00:18:11,065
Judas.

185
00:18:15,653 --> 00:18:17,947
That should get you started.

186
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,367
Hundred grand.

187
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:32,461
What do you got to lose?
He just wants to meet you.

188
00:18:33,128 --> 00:18:36,381
One time.
You don't like the situation...

189
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,300
...walk away.

190
00:18:39,802 --> 00:18:44,389
- And that's it?
- That's it. And you keep the money.

191
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,566
What did he say?

192
00:18:57,486 --> 00:18:58,945
All right, look, look.

193
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:03,992
Your client is wanted on 24 counts of
electronic crimes...

194
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:06,328
...in 6 different countries.

195
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:08,413
He has a Finnish passport.

196
00:19:08,663 --> 00:19:14,044
These allegations are not recognized
as crimes. Your laws don't apply.

197
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,759
Do you see a Finnish flag hanging
on the wall, IKEA boy?

198
00:19:25,222 --> 00:19:28,642
- What did he say?
- He said IKEA is Swedish.

199
00:19:29,684 --> 00:19:31,937
He understands English, huh?

200
00:19:33,229 --> 00:19:36,524
- Let me talk to him.
- He's all yours.

201
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,903
You're fucked up now, Hamlet.

202
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:48,536
The thing is, they have you put
the furniture together yourself.

203
00:19:49,829 --> 00:19:53,833
My client has reserved his right
not to answer any questions.

204
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,503
Why would the best hacker
in the world...

205
00:19:56,711 --> 00:20:00,882
...risk life imprisonment by coming
into the continental U.S.?

206
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:05,428
Okay, what did he just say?

207
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:08,723
He never misses an episode
of Survivor.

208
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,100
Did he really say that?

209
00:20:15,563 --> 00:20:17,357
You're funny.

210
00:20:19,734 --> 00:20:23,446
- How much do you weigh?
- How much do I weigh?

211
00:20:29,952 --> 00:20:32,163
We'll call you if we need you.

212
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:35,416
Eat a dick.

213
00:20:42,131 --> 00:20:44,634
Wipe that smile off your face.

214
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:06,280
A year ago, I was head of the largest
cyber-criminal task force in the world.

215
00:21:07,615 --> 00:21:09,283
But I burned out.

216
00:21:10,618 --> 00:21:12,286
I snapped.

217
00:21:13,662 --> 00:21:16,457
I shot a suspect in the hand.

218
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:23,047
You know how difficult it is to work
a keyboard with one hand?

219
00:21:23,339 --> 00:21:29,345
You don't understand. Whatever you
want to do to me, he'll do worse.

220
00:21:30,846 --> 00:21:32,639
I'm already dead.

221
00:21:33,474 --> 00:21:37,478
My only chance is back in Europe.
I have friends there.

222
00:21:37,853 --> 00:21:39,855
Tell me what I want to know.

223
00:21:40,022 --> 00:21:43,817
You'll be on the first thing smoking.
First class.

224
00:21:44,318 --> 00:21:46,487
Courtesy of the U.S. government.

225
00:21:46,862 --> 00:21:48,405
Who is he?

226
00:21:50,532 --> 00:21:54,912
- I don't know his name.
- You work for him. You don't know?

227
00:21:56,747 --> 00:21:58,832
Tell me something.

228
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,669
I'll tell you what I know.

229
00:22:12,971 --> 00:22:16,808
He exists in a world
beyond your world.

230
00:22:27,235 --> 00:22:30,363
What we only fantasize, he does.

231
00:22:30,864 --> 00:22:34,409
He lives a life
where nothing is beyond him.

232
00:22:43,668 --> 00:22:46,880
But you know what?
It's all a facade.

233
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:53,970
For all his charm and charisma,
his wealth, his expensive toys...

234
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:59,309
...he is a driven, unflinching,
calculating machine.

235
00:23:00,477 --> 00:23:03,730
He takes what he wants,
when he wants...

236
00:23:04,272 --> 00:23:06,107
...and disappears.

237
00:23:08,067 --> 00:23:10,028
So how do I find him?

238
00:23:10,778 --> 00:23:13,489
You don't find him. He finds you.

239
00:23:15,825 --> 00:23:17,785
Here's how it works.

240
00:23:18,244 --> 00:23:20,747
His people pick me up.
Take me to him.

241
00:23:20,955 --> 00:23:23,624
He tells me what he wants me to do.

242
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,586
I do the job right there.

243
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,797
I get paid, and I leave.

244
00:23:34,343 --> 00:23:39,348
That's a really nice story, but you
haven't told me shit, have you?

245
00:23:40,892 --> 00:23:44,562
- Excuse me, sir. You have a call.
- Take a message.

246
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:48,774
It's assistant director Joy.
He said it's important.

247
00:23:54,655 --> 00:23:57,533
I can only tell you
what I've done for him.

248
00:23:58,659 --> 00:24:00,328
Well, that's a start.

249
00:24:03,622 --> 00:24:06,792
Thank you. You've just
let my client go free.

250
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:10,421
- You denied his right to counsel-
- Excuse me.

251
00:24:11,922 --> 00:24:14,133
Yeah, and you eat the dick!

252
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,655
Yes, I got a call from A.D. Joy.
This is Roberts.

253
00:24:37,031 --> 00:24:39,324
Hold for just one moment, sir.

254
00:25:21,575 --> 00:25:24,703
- Joy.
- Yeah, Roberts. You needed me.

255
00:25:31,835 --> 00:25:33,003
You didn't call?

256
00:25:36,756 --> 00:25:39,050
No, Roberts. What do you want?

257
00:25:53,398 --> 00:25:56,568
You should've let me
buy you a suit, Stanley.

258
00:25:57,235 --> 00:25:59,571
I'm happy with what I'm wearing.

259
00:26:00,113 --> 00:26:01,739
Ignorance is bliss.

260
00:26:39,986 --> 00:26:41,320
Miss me?

261
00:26:41,904 --> 00:26:45,116
- Stanley, Gabriel.
- Big Stan.

262
00:26:45,324 --> 00:26:47,243
- Nice suit.
- Thanks.

263
00:26:47,827 --> 00:26:51,622
- They say the clothes make the man.
- You buy it?

264
00:26:52,164 --> 00:26:54,041
Hope not. Drink?

265
00:26:56,002 --> 00:27:00,548
I flew 1500 miles for this meeting.
How about we get to the point?

266
00:27:00,756 --> 00:27:05,011
No. Actually, you flew 1500 miles
for 100 grand.

267
00:27:05,219 --> 00:27:09,473
But that's not the point.
Helga. Meet Stanley.

268
00:27:11,517 --> 00:27:14,019
- Hello, Stanley.
- Helga.

269
00:27:14,353 --> 00:27:17,690
Look, I don't have
a lot of patience, Gabriel.

270
00:27:19,024 --> 00:27:21,485
Maybe you can help me with something.

271
00:27:25,573 --> 00:27:27,199
Take a look at this.

272
00:27:31,787 --> 00:27:33,998
You know I can't touch that.

273
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:37,293
Do you like tequila, Stanley?

274
00:27:50,097 --> 00:27:51,432
This is bullshit.

275
00:27:51,682 --> 00:27:54,726
You want something from me,
and I from you.

276
00:27:54,893 --> 00:27:58,689
DOD d-base, 128-bit encryption.
What do you think?

277
00:27:58,897 --> 00:28:01,191
- Impossible?
- Nothing's impossible.

278
00:28:01,441 --> 00:28:05,195
Good. Maybe slide in
a Trojan horse hiding a worm?

279
00:28:05,404 --> 00:28:08,699
- Is this an interview?
- Sort of. Marco.

280
00:28:09,575 --> 00:28:11,576
Give him some incentive.

281
00:28:12,411 --> 00:28:16,415
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Relax, Stanley.

282
00:28:25,006 --> 00:28:29,177
I have been told that
the best crackers in the world...

283
00:28:29,428 --> 00:28:31,638
...can do this in 60 minutes.

284
00:28:31,972 --> 00:28:35,433
Unfortunately, I need someone
to do it in 60 seconds.

285
00:28:35,684 --> 00:28:36,810
You're kidding.

286
00:28:36,935 --> 00:28:39,229
Afraid not. Go.

287
00:28:40,897 --> 00:28:41,898
Get up, get up!

288
00:28:43,984 --> 00:28:46,194
- Fifty-five.
- Get on with it.

289
00:28:46,403 --> 00:28:51,032
- What the hell is this?
- Time's a-wasting, big guy.

290
00:28:51,908 --> 00:28:53,660
Oh, Jesus.

291
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,623
Forty-five seconds.

292
00:29:11,136 --> 00:29:13,263
Oh, she's good, isn't she?

293
00:29:14,138 --> 00:29:17,016
What's going on here?
Jesus Christ.

294
00:29:20,937 --> 00:29:23,773
- More time, more time!
- Come on, Stan!

295
00:29:25,817 --> 00:29:28,278
Twenty. Nineteen.

296
00:29:35,827 --> 00:29:36,953
Fifteen.

297
00:29:40,748 --> 00:29:42,041
Come on.

298
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:44,460
Ten. Nine.

299
00:29:54,512 --> 00:29:55,513
Three.

300
00:29:55,763 --> 00:29:57,765
Two. One.

301
00:29:59,308 --> 00:30:01,978
- Too bad. You gotta die.
- No, wait!

302
00:30:08,567 --> 00:30:11,028
I was just fucking with you, Stan.

303
00:30:34,009 --> 00:30:35,803
That's our guy.

304
00:30:49,358 --> 00:30:53,112
- Get away from me.
- I really want to help you, Stan.

305
00:30:57,408 --> 00:30:59,701
Like you helped me in there?

306
00:30:59,952 --> 00:31:02,204
- That was a test, Stan.
- A test.

307
00:31:02,412 --> 00:31:03,539
And you passed.

308
00:31:03,747 --> 00:31:06,834
I don't know why I let you
talk me into this.

309
00:31:07,042 --> 00:31:08,877
You're saving your daughter.

310
00:31:09,086 --> 00:31:13,715
I'd do anything for her, but if
I end up in a box or in jail...

311
00:31:13,882 --> 00:31:16,051
...then I really can't help her.

312
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:19,346
I'm taking my money
and going back to court!

313
00:31:19,554 --> 00:31:21,640
With your little $100,000?

314
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:25,143
Melissa will throw $500,000
back at you. Think!

315
00:31:25,394 --> 00:31:30,065
I'm thinking that you'll put a gun
to my head just to see if I can-

316
00:31:34,277 --> 00:31:36,738
I can't pee in front of an audience.

317
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:54,047
Let me break it down to you, Stanley,
one last time.

318
00:31:54,256 --> 00:31:56,216
You live in a trailer.

319
00:31:56,424 --> 00:31:59,886
You're a felon.
You work a dead-end job.

320
00:32:00,095 --> 00:32:03,264
And you desperately want
your daughter back.

321
00:32:03,473 --> 00:32:06,684
Gabriel is your only shot.

322
00:32:07,102 --> 00:32:08,770
Take it.

323
00:32:09,979 --> 00:32:15,443
- I'm concerned about our new friend.
- Oh, now, don't be jealous.

324
00:32:15,985 --> 00:32:19,781
I don't see him dragging his sorry ass
over the finish line.

325
00:32:19,989 --> 00:32:23,284
- Thought we lost you.
- Tell me what the deal is.

326
00:32:23,493 --> 00:32:27,789
The deal is that we're having
a little gathering at the house.

327
00:32:27,997 --> 00:32:30,875
Come and I'll explain it to you there.

328
00:32:34,796 --> 00:32:38,341
Gentlemen, if it's not good news,
don't say it.

329
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:43,137
Actually, we have a ray of hope
in the darkness of your life.

330
00:32:43,346 --> 00:32:48,309
When we grabbed Torvalds at the
airport, these two guys were there.

331
00:32:48,518 --> 00:32:50,144
Check this out.

332
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,440
Recognize those two same guys,
a few hours later.

333
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,400
And then...

334
00:32:57,527 --> 00:32:59,320
...guess who shows up.

335
00:32:59,987 --> 00:33:01,864
Stanley Jobson.

336
00:33:02,073 --> 00:33:05,660
Wired magazine's 1996
Man of the Year.

337
00:33:05,993 --> 00:33:09,121
A burnout now, but the
hacker Zeitgeist then.

338
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:12,124
Yeah, I know Jobson, I arrested him.

339
00:33:15,711 --> 00:33:17,880
Why are you in L.A., Stan?

340
00:33:19,382 --> 00:33:22,009
His ex-wife and daughter
live in Malibu.

341
00:33:22,218 --> 00:33:27,556
The new husband owns Backdoor Films,
a shady porn production house.

342
00:33:27,765 --> 00:33:31,227
The production value's good,
considering that they shoot on video.

343
00:33:31,435 --> 00:33:36,190
- His wife is in some of the videos.
- I know. She's like an actress.

344
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:38,943
That's great. Are you done?

345
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:40,861
Who's the girl?

346
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:45,449
Actually, sir, we don't know yet.

347
00:33:47,076 --> 00:33:52,206
- She's a serious piece of talent.
- Man, she's way out of his league.

348
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:55,918
Find out who she is.

349
00:33:57,753 --> 00:34:01,048
- Sit on the ex-wife's house.
- You got it.

350
00:34:10,516 --> 00:34:12,518
Stanley, you want to get wet?

351
00:34:12,768 --> 00:34:15,479
- I don't have a suit.
- You don't need one.

352
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:17,689
- Come on, Stan.
- Later.

353
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:23,612
- Some view. Let's get a drink.
- Pool lights on.

354
00:34:38,752 --> 00:34:40,420
- So how did you do it?
- Do what?

355
00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:41,838
Break the code.

356
00:34:42,089 --> 00:34:44,800
I dropped a logic bomb
through the trap door.

357
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,761
No, you didn't.
You didn't have time.

358
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:50,597
- What'll you have?
- Scotch.

359
00:34:50,805 --> 00:34:54,809
- You can do better than that.
- I used a password sniffer.

360
00:34:56,144 --> 00:34:58,230
How did you do it?

361
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:03,151
I don't know exactly. I see the code
in my head. I can't explain it.

362
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,112
Let me show you something.

363
00:35:19,876 --> 00:35:21,878
Pretty impressive, huh?

364
00:35:25,882 --> 00:35:30,136
So, what we need from you is a worm.
A hydra, actually.

365
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:34,974
A multiheaded worm to sniff out digital
footprints across an encrypted network.

366
00:35:36,017 --> 00:35:39,228
- What kind of cipher?
- A Vernam encryption.

367
00:35:40,355 --> 00:35:43,066
The key code is destroyed
upon implementation.

368
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:45,985
And it's a true 128-bit encryption.

369
00:35:46,194 --> 00:35:49,489
Well, actually,
we're talking a 512-bit.

370
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:55,995
- That's definitely not possible.
- What if I give you 10 million dollars?

371
00:35:57,455 --> 00:36:00,458
That would cover all your problems.
Yes?

372
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:04,045
Unless, of course, it's not possible.

373
00:36:04,253 --> 00:36:07,131
But you think about it.

374
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:19,310
It won't bite you. I promise.

375
00:36:25,566 --> 00:36:31,113
This is not just a multi-screen system.
It has a DS-3 connection.

376
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:34,742
We can access 6 different networks
simultaneously.

377
00:36:38,871 --> 00:36:43,792
It has a central encryption you
have to crack to utilize the system.

378
00:36:44,043 --> 00:36:45,002
Try it.

379
00:36:45,252 --> 00:36:48,047
It'll be hard without a gun
to my head.

380
00:36:48,255 --> 00:36:50,758
Maybe I should put a gun to your head.

381
00:36:56,597 --> 00:36:58,474
I thought you were Gabriel's.

382
00:36:58,682 --> 00:37:01,727
- I'm not what you think I am.
- Ginger.

383
00:37:09,693 --> 00:37:14,531
You surprised that a girl with
an IQ over 60 can give you a hard-on?

384
00:37:21,413 --> 00:37:24,082
So is it impossible?

385
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,752
Nothing's impossible.

386
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,921
Good. So we have a deal.

387
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:07,250
- Morning.
- You mean afternoon?

388
00:38:15,175 --> 00:38:18,178
Can I borrow your car for something?

389
00:38:18,511 --> 00:38:20,013
Sure.

390
00:38:20,722 --> 00:38:22,557
- There you go.
- Thank you.

391
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:27,562
Hey, Stan, if you're going
to see Holly...

392
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:31,274
...I suggest you re-evaluate
the way you look.

393
00:38:31,483 --> 00:38:32,817
Just a thought.

394
00:38:33,526 --> 00:38:35,069
Just a thought.

395
00:39:43,387 --> 00:39:45,389
Come on, Mom, pick up.

396
00:39:47,808 --> 00:39:51,270
- Mom late again?
- She'll be here in a minute.

397
00:39:58,402 --> 00:40:03,240
Hi. Can I have the phone number for
Yellow Cab?

398
00:40:03,449 --> 00:40:04,742
Need a lift?

399
00:40:07,077 --> 00:40:08,537
Daddy!

400
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:12,541
Oh, what are you doing here?

401
00:40:15,252 --> 00:40:19,131
- I missed you so much.
- Oh, I missed you too, baby.

402
00:40:19,381 --> 00:40:24,303
- I brought you something.
- Oh, my gosh. It's so cute.

403
00:40:25,012 --> 00:40:29,600
Oh, Dad. If Mom finds out,
she'll have you thrown in jail.

404
00:40:29,808 --> 00:40:32,269
It's okay, baby.
You want a lift home?

405
00:40:32,477 --> 00:40:36,064
- Of course I do.
- Come here. All right.

406
00:40:37,649 --> 00:40:39,568
You are heavy.

407
00:40:40,193 --> 00:40:43,113
- Nice car.
- Hey, thanks.

408
00:40:45,574 --> 00:40:47,868
Is that Mommy's car?
Is she home?

409
00:40:49,411 --> 00:40:51,621
That's my step-dad's car.

410
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:56,293
So listen to me.

411
00:40:59,337 --> 00:41:02,048
I found a way for us to be together.

412
00:41:07,637 --> 00:41:10,557
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

413
00:41:10,765 --> 00:41:12,559
Everything's going to be fine.

414
00:41:16,021 --> 00:41:19,399
Everything's going to be okay.
Just trust me.

415
00:41:21,693 --> 00:41:24,821
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you. Come here.

416
00:41:25,363 --> 00:41:26,614
Oh, God.

417
00:41:28,116 --> 00:41:30,160
You go home. Okay? Bye.

418
00:41:30,452 --> 00:41:32,871
- I miss you.
- I miss you too. Go.

419
00:41:40,879 --> 00:41:42,505
Oh, sweetheart.

420
00:41:43,256 --> 00:41:44,549
Hey.

421
00:41:47,552 --> 00:41:49,012
Come here.

422
00:41:50,138 --> 00:41:51,931
It's okay. Go. Go.

423
00:41:52,724 --> 00:41:53,975
Go.

424
00:42:17,748 --> 00:42:19,500
Who the hell are you?

425
00:42:19,709 --> 00:42:21,878
- A friend of a friend.
- Shit.

426
00:42:23,963 --> 00:42:26,007
Oh, fuck. Fuck!

427
00:42:34,807 --> 00:42:36,058
Hold it! Stanley!

428
00:42:42,523 --> 00:42:43,524
Go!

429
00:43:21,061 --> 00:43:22,438
Oh, fuck.

430
00:43:31,864 --> 00:43:33,031
Oh, fuck!

431
00:44:14,614 --> 00:44:16,116
Don't move!

432
00:44:17,993 --> 00:44:19,494
Don't move.

433
00:44:19,786 --> 00:44:21,288
Come here.

434
00:44:28,336 --> 00:44:30,004
Look at this.

435
00:44:30,505 --> 00:44:32,590
What were you running for?

436
00:44:33,341 --> 00:44:35,510
You arresting me?

437
00:44:35,718 --> 00:44:40,431
For violating your parole
by leaving Texas without permission?

438
00:44:40,682 --> 00:44:45,520
Or evading an officer and almost
getting me killed in the process?!

439
00:44:47,564 --> 00:44:50,024
No, I'm not arresting you.

440
00:44:50,775 --> 00:44:52,986
Then why are we talking?

441
00:44:53,653 --> 00:44:56,030
- What are you doing in L.A.?
- Vacationing.

442
00:44:56,281 --> 00:44:57,949
Vacationing, right.

443
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:02,745
The judge is allowing you to
see your daughter?

444
00:45:02,954 --> 00:45:04,831
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you? Oh?

445
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:10,211
You just want to get right down to it?
Okay, fine.

446
00:45:11,921 --> 00:45:14,465
I can help you with your daughter.

447
00:45:16,259 --> 00:45:18,553
You help me, I'll help you.

448
00:45:19,095 --> 00:45:21,889
You'll have to forgive me.
The fact that...

449
00:45:22,098 --> 00:45:25,226
...you put me in jail
doesn't inspire trust.

450
00:45:25,434 --> 00:45:28,938
You put a virus in an FBI program
and set it back two years.

451
00:45:29,146 --> 00:45:32,358
They were reading ISP subscribers'
e- mail. It was illegal.

452
00:45:32,608 --> 00:45:36,487
- I did what the judges wouldn't do!
- You broke the law!

453
00:45:36,737 --> 00:45:42,201
We both did what we had to do.
And your program is back in full swing.

454
00:45:43,828 --> 00:45:47,748
Nice trip down memory lane,
but if you aren't arresting me-

455
00:45:52,294 --> 00:45:55,339
Not getting a lot of cooperation here.

456
00:45:56,382 --> 00:45:59,385
I ran into your friend Torvalds
the other day.

457
00:45:59,635 --> 00:46:01,679
He was vacationing too.

458
00:46:02,304 --> 00:46:06,100
What are the odds of you
being in L.A. at the same time?

459
00:46:06,809 --> 00:46:09,061
I'm just a sucker for Disneyland.

460
00:46:11,313 --> 00:46:12,773
We done?

461
00:46:13,399 --> 00:46:14,775
Good.

462
00:46:14,984 --> 00:46:17,444
Tell Torvalds I said hello.

463
00:46:17,653 --> 00:46:21,657
You can tell him yourself
if you're not careful. He's dead.

464
00:46:22,991 --> 00:46:24,701
Give me a card.

465
00:46:25,994 --> 00:46:28,956
You think of anything to say,
call me.

466
00:46:29,665 --> 00:46:32,126
Sorry about your nose.

467
00:46:37,422 --> 00:46:40,968
- You're in way over your head.
- I know.

468
00:46:43,512 --> 00:46:46,974
- You want me to watch him?
- Yeah, set it up.

469
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:17,462
I've had a shitty day so far,
but I think it just got worse.

470
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:36,856
Either shoot me, or tell me why
you're wearing that wire.

471
00:47:37,273 --> 00:47:38,817
Can't do that.

472
00:47:39,234 --> 00:47:40,819
Who are you, Ginger?

473
00:47:42,362 --> 00:47:44,030
I can't tell you.

474
00:47:45,406 --> 00:47:47,909
Who are you?

475
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:50,828
He'll kill me if he finds out.

476
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:53,331
That's not my problem, is it?

477
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:58,628
You're asking for a lot of faith
without giving me any.

478
00:48:14,769 --> 00:48:17,105
You brought me into this mess.

479
00:48:18,106 --> 00:48:20,775
I deserve to know who's playing me.

480
00:48:23,486 --> 00:48:25,363
Who are you?

481
00:48:31,911 --> 00:48:33,579
I'm DEA, Stanley.

482
00:48:33,788 --> 00:48:35,081
Holy shit.

483
00:48:35,581 --> 00:48:38,459
We're after Gabriel.
Give him the worm...

484
00:48:38,668 --> 00:48:42,338
...take the money and get out of here.
That's all.

485
00:48:47,301 --> 00:48:48,928
This looks friendly.

486
00:48:52,598 --> 00:48:55,434
You know me, I'm a friendly girl.

487
00:48:57,478 --> 00:49:00,356
Come on, Stanley. Let's get coffee.

488
00:49:21,627 --> 00:49:23,045
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

489
00:49:23,796 --> 00:49:26,298
- Ever heard of Operation Swordfish?
- No.

490
00:49:26,507 --> 00:49:29,009
Then you'll appreciate the irony.

491
00:49:29,176 --> 00:49:30,302
Triple espresso.

492
00:49:31,804 --> 00:49:33,847
- Two.
- Okay.

493
00:49:34,473 --> 00:49:38,519
In the '80s, the DEA set up a
network of dummy corporations...

494
00:49:38,727 --> 00:49:42,648
...as a front to launder drug money
and gather evidence.

495
00:49:43,148 --> 00:49:46,818
But these companies
started to make a lot of money.

496
00:49:47,027 --> 00:49:52,032
In 1986, when it was terminated,
$400 million was in these accounts.

497
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,160
Money that just sort of disappeared.

498
00:49:56,328 --> 00:49:59,831
It didn't disappear.
It sat, earning interest.

499
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:04,753
That's 15 years ago. You know
how much money that is today?

500
00:50:07,255 --> 00:50:09,132
Nine and a half billion.

501
00:50:12,427 --> 00:50:17,349
This is a sweet deal. We go in over
the phone lines, pop the firewall...

502
00:50:17,557 --> 00:50:20,727
...drop in the hydra
and wait for the money.

503
00:50:21,478 --> 00:50:23,980
Aren't you getting ahead of yourself?

504
00:50:24,356 --> 00:50:29,027
To access the cluster, you need a bank
on the backbone of the network.

505
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:34,532
- Know how long that'll take to find?
- Not a problem. Look behind you.

506
00:50:50,757 --> 00:50:52,217
Cheers.

507
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:04,646
These fellows might wear Armani...

508
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:08,316
...but they have the swagger
of ex-military.

509
00:51:09,609 --> 00:51:12,904
Maybe bodyguards,
but they look like mercs to me.

510
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:18,076
Something's going on. They have two
DS-3 trucks. That's serious bandwidth.

511
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:22,330
Thermal scopes show a huge heat load.
Could be mainframes.

512
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:25,792
The house was listed
by Celebrity Estates.

513
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:29,462
It was leased two weeks ago
by a blind corporation.

514
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,672
No other info on them yet.

515
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,927
Wait a minute, Joe.

516
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,638
Blue shirt, pinstripe.

517
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:44,936
Oh, yeah, that's him.

518
00:51:46,479 --> 00:51:48,481
That's our man right there.

519
00:51:57,490 --> 00:52:00,785
Just in time to watch Stanley
find our worm.

520
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:06,040
In college, I created the source code
for the worm I use.

521
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:14,465
In the basement is the only PDP-10
still active and on the Internet.

522
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,383
Not many people know it.

523
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:20,304
It's an ITS machine,
kept online for historical sake.

524
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:23,807
I hid my worm there,
where no one would ever look.

525
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:29,313
Voila.

526
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:18,445
Good man. Good man.

527
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:35,545
Senator, we have a problem.

528
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:42,886
- Senator.
- Seems you're in a predicament.

529
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:44,220
Is that right?

530
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:47,766
- I don't follow.
- Download your file.

531
00:53:58,776 --> 00:54:01,654
- Senator-
- You know where I got these?

532
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:06,784
From the deputy director of the FBI.
He thought I might be interested.

533
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:12,915
Sir, do you think there is any aspect
of this operation I am not aware of?

534
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:16,586
We are aborting the operation.
Take a vacation.

535
00:54:16,794 --> 00:54:19,756
A vacation?
Have I ever failed you, sir?

536
00:54:19,922 --> 00:54:23,426
- That's not really the point, is it?
- It's my point.

537
00:54:23,634 --> 00:54:26,220
You're losing sight of our objective.

538
00:54:26,637 --> 00:54:28,765
The risks are too great.

539
00:54:28,973 --> 00:54:31,642
We'll seek alternative means
of finance.

540
00:54:32,101 --> 00:54:36,439
This operation is moving ahead.
Everything is under control.

541
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:53,622
Son...

542
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:58,252
...let's just say you've got
a 200-pound Rottweiler.

543
00:55:00,254 --> 00:55:02,465
Now, he loves you.

544
00:55:02,673 --> 00:55:05,426
It's his job to protect you.

545
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:09,638
But if he bites you,
you got to put him down.

546
00:55:12,433 --> 00:55:16,562
Can never tell who he might bite next.
You understand?

547
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:18,981
Yes, I do understand, senator.

548
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:23,193
I think we got a team on the
West Coast. Fort Mac Arthur.

549
00:55:23,444 --> 00:55:26,405
Maybe they should
pay our friend a visit.

550
00:55:36,874 --> 00:55:38,333
Come on.

551
00:55:41,295 --> 00:55:43,964
Network IP range.
Confirmed.

552
00:55:44,465 --> 00:55:46,675
Please confirm. Confirm. Confirm.

553
00:55:48,469 --> 00:55:50,387
We are cruising!

554
00:55:55,058 --> 00:55:56,518
Oh, yeah.

555
00:56:02,983 --> 00:56:05,319
Next. And next.

556
00:56:05,861 --> 00:56:07,362
Too easy.

557
00:56:07,779 --> 00:56:10,324
No, don't. No, no, no. Yes!

558
00:56:10,532 --> 00:56:14,786
Three percent, please.
Oh, fuck. I'm fucked.

559
00:56:15,328 --> 00:56:17,205
No, no, no. Fuck you!

560
00:56:18,957 --> 00:56:21,001
Shit, there's no fucking way.

561
00:56:21,251 --> 00:56:22,961
I'm rusty. Rusty.

562
00:56:26,423 --> 00:56:27,966
Come on, come on.

563
00:56:37,851 --> 00:56:40,812
Okay. Time to disguise you...

564
00:56:42,397 --> 00:56:45,233
...as an internal destruction.

565
00:56:46,609 --> 00:56:50,155
Quick, quick. Thank you.
Return.

566
00:56:50,989 --> 00:56:54,159
Three, two, one, go. Come on.

567
00:56:54,409 --> 00:56:55,994
Come on. Yeah.

568
00:56:57,912 --> 00:56:59,080
Close.

569
00:57:00,748 --> 00:57:02,208
Yes.

570
00:57:07,297 --> 00:57:08,756
Oh, baby.

571
00:57:30,695 --> 00:57:33,448
Now I've just got to
modify the code.

572
00:57:37,994 --> 00:57:39,954
The bank's IDS logs every packer...

573
00:57:40,163 --> 00:57:43,666
...that go to any port other than
the 22 or 80 TCP.

574
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,043
Holy shit.

575
00:57:46,669 --> 00:57:50,798
Okay, Chateau Attigue 1996.
White, white.

576
00:57:53,759 --> 00:57:55,177
Nope.

577
00:57:56,512 --> 00:57:58,681
Come on, come on.

578
00:58:04,812 --> 00:58:06,313
Here we go.

579
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:11,152
Twenty-six. Ninety-six. Nine-

580
00:58:13,362 --> 00:58:14,697
Oh, shit!

581
00:58:24,373 --> 00:58:27,960
What's the matter?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

582
00:58:28,377 --> 00:58:30,462
- We gotta talk.
- Let's take a drive.

583
00:58:30,671 --> 00:58:33,007
- Can't we talk here?
- We shouldn't.

584
00:58:35,259 --> 00:58:37,177
Ever heard of Harry Houdini?

585
00:58:37,386 --> 00:58:41,682
He wasn't like today's magicians,
only interested in television ratings.

586
00:58:41,849 --> 00:58:46,770
He was an artist. He could make an
elephant disappear in a full theater.

587
00:58:46,937 --> 00:58:48,981
You know how he did that?

588
00:58:49,231 --> 00:58:51,233
- Misdirection.
- What are you talking about?

589
00:58:51,483 --> 00:58:55,988
Misdirection. What the eyes see
and the ears hear, the mind believes.

590
00:58:59,032 --> 00:59:02,119
- What's going on?
- We've got a tail. Hold on.

591
00:59:09,251 --> 00:59:10,377
Shit.

592
00:59:13,422 --> 00:59:14,589
Jesus. Jesus!

593
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:25,517
Take the wheel.

594
00:59:25,767 --> 00:59:27,811
- What?
- Take the wheel!

595
00:59:37,779 --> 00:59:38,780
Holy shit!

596
00:59:46,621 --> 00:59:48,248
Who are those guys?

597
00:59:49,082 --> 00:59:50,083
Jesus!

598
00:59:53,294 --> 00:59:55,505
What the fuck are you doing?

599
01:00:01,094 --> 01:00:02,095
Jesus!

600
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:22,240
Drive, Stan.

601
01:00:23,783 --> 01:00:24,951
Move!

602
01:00:25,785 --> 01:00:28,287
- I can't drive this thing.
- Learn!

603
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:34,377
- Move it.
- Come on!

604
01:01:05,491 --> 01:01:07,535
Hard left! Hard left!

605
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:22,716
Keep going!

606
01:01:24,635 --> 01:01:25,636
Go!

607
01:02:17,854 --> 01:02:19,231
Get in the car.

608
01:02:21,441 --> 01:02:24,695
Not until you tell me
what I'm involved in.

609
01:02:26,947 --> 01:02:29,449
Look, Stanley, I like you.

610
01:02:29,699 --> 01:02:34,579
You're on my good side. But don't
confuse kindness with weakness.

611
01:02:34,788 --> 01:02:38,792
You have 12 hours to get the hydra.
So get in the car.

612
01:02:43,421 --> 01:02:46,132
Stanley, are you okay?

613
01:02:46,341 --> 01:02:50,887
I just saw that maniac murder people
in the street. I'm fucking great.

614
01:02:51,096 --> 01:02:54,766
You can't leave. It'll all work out.
You gotta trust me.

615
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:56,142
Trust you? Yeah.

616
01:02:56,351 --> 01:03:01,481
You're DEA, I got the feds up my ass and
I don't know what's going on here.

617
01:03:01,731 --> 01:03:05,276
If we don't find out who he works for,
we'll have to start over.

618
01:03:05,485 --> 01:03:09,364
That's not my problem.
I don't care who he works for.

619
01:03:09,614 --> 01:03:12,992
What about Holly?
Do you give a shit about her?

620
01:03:13,201 --> 01:03:16,412
Finish the job.
We'll get your daughter back.

621
01:03:16,663 --> 01:03:18,289
I promise.

622
01:04:10,925 --> 01:04:13,803
Ah, the great American outdoors.

623
01:04:14,303 --> 01:04:17,681
Yet I never understood
the appeal of fly-fishing.

624
01:04:17,848 --> 01:04:22,019
A bit too much like masturbation for me
without the payoff.

625
01:04:22,603 --> 01:04:25,648
This is a catch-and-release stream,
isn't it?

626
01:04:25,856 --> 01:04:27,817
Yeah, I believe it is.

627
01:04:28,359 --> 01:04:31,320
You must see the irony in that,
senator.

628
01:04:31,695 --> 01:04:37,117
Chairman of the subcommittee on crime
fishing in a catch-and-release stream.

629
01:04:38,452 --> 01:04:41,997
How could you do it to me, Jim?
After all we suffered.

630
01:04:42,206 --> 01:04:45,960
I've changed my identity so often
I don't know who I am anymore.

631
01:04:46,168 --> 01:04:49,588
How could you do it?
We were so close to our goal!

632
01:04:49,797 --> 01:04:51,882
The FBI was watching you.

633
01:04:57,554 --> 01:04:59,515
You tried to kill me.

634
01:04:59,723 --> 01:05:04,561
You've misplaced your loyalty, senator.
You've sold out America.

635
01:05:07,731 --> 01:05:11,568
Patriotism does not have
a four-year shelf life.

636
01:05:14,029 --> 01:05:15,656
But politicians do.

637
01:05:21,995 --> 01:05:23,914
What are you doing with that?

638
01:05:27,584 --> 01:05:30,670
Thomas Jefferson once shot a man
for treason.

639
01:05:31,088 --> 01:05:33,173
Hold the phone. Thomas Jeff-

640
01:06:11,044 --> 01:06:13,379
- Stan. How are you?
- Fine.

641
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:15,090
Finished?

642
01:06:21,304 --> 01:06:25,892
Is this Stanley Jobson,
social security number 669547311?

643
01:06:26,643 --> 01:06:29,812
I'm calling from Credit Suisse
to notify you...

644
01:06:29,979 --> 01:06:33,775
...that $ 10 million was transferred
into your new account.

645
01:06:33,983 --> 01:06:36,653
- As promised.
- Thanks.

646
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:42,283
So I'm done, then.

647
01:06:42,492 --> 01:06:44,660
Soon. Walk with me.

648
01:06:48,539 --> 01:06:52,460
Against my better judgment,
I'm going to tell you who I am.

649
01:06:52,668 --> 01:06:55,004
- I know who you are.
- Do you?

650
01:06:55,213 --> 01:06:58,007
I think you think I'm a bank robber.

651
01:06:58,216 --> 01:07:01,093
But the truth is, I'm just like you.

652
01:07:01,302 --> 01:07:04,263
Like me?
No. Because you're a murderer.

653
01:07:04,472 --> 01:07:08,976
That I am, and worse. But I do
have ethics. Rules I adhere to.

654
01:07:09,227 --> 01:07:14,148
- Why are you telling me this?
- Well, if you listen, then you'll know.

655
01:07:14,398 --> 01:07:17,526
You asked who those men were.
I'll tell you.

656
01:07:17,735 --> 01:07:22,865
Hoover started a secret organization
in the '50s, called Black Cell.

657
01:07:23,074 --> 01:07:25,159
To protect our freedoms.

658
01:07:25,367 --> 01:07:28,496
I don't care.
All I care about is my daughter.

659
01:07:28,662 --> 01:07:32,374
I'm talking about your daughter.
You, your daughter...

660
01:07:32,875 --> 01:07:36,420
...and 200 million Americans who take
their freedoms for granted.

661
01:07:36,629 --> 01:07:37,588
I see.

662
01:07:37,796 --> 01:07:42,760
You don't know what it takes to
protect our freedoms. That's my job.

663
01:07:43,010 --> 01:07:45,095
To protect your way of life.

664
01:07:46,347 --> 01:07:51,769
So you're really stealing all this
money just to protect little old me.

665
01:07:52,019 --> 01:07:55,898
That's right, Stanley.
Because wars cost money.

666
01:07:58,942 --> 01:08:00,402
War?

667
01:08:02,738 --> 01:08:04,782
Who are we at war with?

668
01:08:11,371 --> 01:08:14,374
Anyone who impinges
on America's freedom.

669
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:16,793
Terrorist states, Stanley.

670
01:08:17,294 --> 01:08:20,214
Someone must bring their war to them.

671
01:08:25,218 --> 01:08:27,763
They bomb a church, we bomb 10.

672
01:08:28,263 --> 01:08:31,350
They hijack a plane,
we take out an airport.

673
01:08:31,558 --> 01:08:35,312
They execute American tourists,
we nuke an entire city.

674
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:40,692
We make terrorism so horrific that
it's unthinkable to attack Americans.

675
01:08:40,859 --> 01:08:45,197
You're not using the phone lines.
You're going into the bank.

676
01:08:45,405 --> 01:08:49,075
And you're coming with us.
It'll all be over in 24 hours.

677
01:08:49,284 --> 01:08:51,453
You're a rich man, Stanley.

678
01:08:51,661 --> 01:08:55,749
Soon you'll be on a yacht with your
daughter, eating bonbons.

679
01:08:55,957 --> 01:08:58,752
The American dream. And just think:

680
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:03,757
You'll have done your small part
in ensuring America's way of life.

681
01:09:04,174 --> 01:09:06,134
You're a hero, Stan.

682
01:09:07,969 --> 01:09:09,471
Stay there!

683
01:09:12,098 --> 01:09:14,476
Don't worry. Let him go.

684
01:09:14,684 --> 01:09:16,269
He'll be back.

685
01:09:16,478 --> 01:09:20,523
Okay, load them up. Let's move out.
Let's go!

686
01:10:08,613 --> 01:10:09,572
Back!

687
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:22,460
Move it, move it! Let's move!

688
01:10:22,668 --> 01:10:25,671
Let's go. Hands behind your head.
Let's go!

689
01:10:27,798 --> 01:10:28,966
Key, please.

690
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:31,969
What key?
I don't know about any key.

691
01:10:37,516 --> 01:10:38,809
Key.

692
01:10:55,367 --> 01:10:57,870
Let's move!
Back of the bank. Now!

693
01:10:58,537 --> 01:11:00,456
Let's go, let's go!

694
01:11:00,914 --> 01:11:03,625
Down. Everyone down!

695
01:11:16,889 --> 01:11:18,599
Just wait here.

696
01:11:23,729 --> 01:11:25,230
Hello?

697
01:11:27,566 --> 01:11:29,026
Melissa?

698
01:11:37,993 --> 01:11:39,286
Holly!

699
01:11:46,626 --> 01:11:49,296
Oh, God. Holly!

700
01:11:54,634 --> 01:11:55,969
Baby!

701
01:11:56,261 --> 01:11:58,346
Baby. Baby. Shit!

702
01:12:12,694 --> 01:12:14,446
No! Release the hostage!

703
01:12:14,988 --> 01:12:16,656
- Help me!
- Let her go!

704
01:12:16,823 --> 01:12:18,324
Let her go!

705
01:12:39,637 --> 01:12:40,972
- Nick.
- Yeah.

706
01:12:41,222 --> 01:12:43,349
- You all right?
- I'm good.

707
01:13:11,711 --> 01:13:14,672
- That was your decision!
- No, you did that!

708
01:13:14,881 --> 01:13:16,924
How many people die is up to you!

709
01:13:17,133 --> 01:13:20,761
I want that plane on the runway
in 25 minutes!

710
01:13:23,139 --> 01:13:26,475
He wants a plane on the runway
in 25 minutes.

711
01:13:26,684 --> 01:13:29,603
My suggestion, sir?
You give it to him!

712
01:13:33,691 --> 01:13:37,069
He wants a plane?
I'll give him a goddamn plane.

713
01:13:37,361 --> 01:13:39,947
- Finish the job.
- Not until I see my daughter!

714
01:13:40,156 --> 01:13:42,908
You want to see her?
Get him his daughter!

715
01:13:46,745 --> 01:13:50,374
- Dad!
- Oh, Jesus. Baby, are you okay?

716
01:13:50,583 --> 01:13:52,418
It's okay, it's okay.

717
01:13:52,793 --> 01:13:54,461
You son of a bitch.

718
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,591
You think I wanted it
to come to this?

719
01:13:58,841 --> 01:14:02,469
I'll sacrifice any lives I have to
to protect this country.

720
01:14:02,803 --> 01:14:04,555
Including my own.

721
01:14:12,771 --> 01:14:16,066
Let her go.
And I'll get your money.

722
01:14:16,567 --> 01:14:20,404
You finish the job, and you both go.
Come on, Stanley.

723
01:14:23,782 --> 01:14:25,742
- I need the disc.
- Disc.

724
01:14:46,596 --> 01:14:50,475
- How do you want it allocated?
- Spread evenly over the accounts.

725
01:14:56,773 --> 01:14:59,401
Come on. Done. Give me my daughter.

726
01:14:59,609 --> 01:15:01,945
- Verify this.
- Good.

727
01:15:02,237 --> 01:15:03,738
Get her.

728
01:15:09,327 --> 01:15:12,080
You okay?
Okay, come on.

729
01:15:14,457 --> 01:15:16,084
Stanley, hold up.

730
01:15:22,507 --> 01:15:23,800
Good job.

731
01:15:29,806 --> 01:15:32,267
- See you around.
- I doubt it.

732
01:15:32,934 --> 01:15:35,728
What's happening? What's happening?

733
01:15:37,981 --> 01:15:39,774
- The money's gone.
- Stop her!

734
01:15:39,941 --> 01:15:41,776
Go! Run!

735
01:15:42,277 --> 01:15:43,486
Go!

736
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:49,200
She's coming out.

737
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:51,119
Come here, come here!

738
01:15:58,501 --> 01:16:00,211
What happened, Stan?

739
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:05,508
The explosion scrambled
the internal clock.

740
01:16:05,717 --> 01:16:08,428
No, it didn't. You fucked me.

741
01:16:13,057 --> 01:16:15,893
You kill me, you'll never get a dollar.

742
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:19,522
The money jumps every 60 seconds
from one account to another.

743
01:16:19,730 --> 01:16:22,316
It'll do so for the next 10 years.

744
01:16:22,942 --> 01:16:26,779
It wasn't supposed to happen
for another six hours, but hey.

745
01:16:26,988 --> 01:16:29,699
- Fix it.
- Unfortunately, I can't.

746
01:16:30,157 --> 01:16:32,785
The accounts are encrypted
with a 1024-bit cipher.

747
01:16:32,994 --> 01:16:36,914
Even I can't get through the firewall.
So here's the deal:

748
01:16:37,164 --> 01:16:40,626
Let the hostages go and I'll
tell you how to get the money.

749
01:16:40,835 --> 01:16:43,170
We all walk away. Nobody gets hurt.

750
01:16:44,547 --> 01:16:45,714
Deal?

751
01:16:46,132 --> 01:16:47,800
I'm thinking.

752
01:16:49,343 --> 01:16:51,762
No deal. Get Ginger.

753
01:16:54,765 --> 01:16:56,183
Move out.

754
01:16:58,769 --> 01:17:00,813
- What are you doing?
- String her up.

755
01:17:01,021 --> 01:17:03,774
- No. Don't do this.
- No! Wait, Wait!

756
01:17:05,776 --> 01:17:08,487
Hey, stay still!
It'll feel real good.

757
01:17:08,946 --> 01:17:10,781
No, don't do this!

758
01:17:18,622 --> 01:17:22,543
- How long will she live? 60 seconds?
- You're insane!

759
01:17:25,295 --> 01:17:27,214
- Fifty-five.
- Okay, okay.

760
01:17:28,298 --> 01:17:31,760
- Hope you built in a back door.
- Come on, come on.

761
01:17:42,896 --> 01:17:44,398
Come on, come on.

762
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:53,115
Thirty.

763
01:17:53,323 --> 01:17:55,659
Plane's on the runway
in a half-hour.

764
01:17:55,826 --> 01:17:57,160
Good.

765
01:18:00,622 --> 01:18:01,915
Twenty.

766
01:18:04,793 --> 01:18:07,963
- She's dying.
- Shut the fuck up!

767
01:18:10,757 --> 01:18:13,301
Ten. Nine. Eight.

768
01:18:13,552 --> 01:18:15,136
Accounts, accounts.

769
01:18:24,187 --> 01:18:25,897
That's it.

770
01:18:26,231 --> 01:18:27,857
Three. Two.

771
01:18:28,024 --> 01:18:30,068
There it is. Get her down!

772
01:18:30,276 --> 01:18:31,778
- Check.
- Verified.

773
01:18:31,945 --> 01:18:33,279
Bring her down.

774
01:18:47,961 --> 01:18:49,546
Jesus.

775
01:18:50,838 --> 01:18:53,883
She was DEA, Stan. Move them out!

776
01:19:02,141 --> 01:19:04,477
Let's move. Quickly and quietly.

777
01:19:04,727 --> 01:19:07,689
- Go, go!
- Move it. Come on, people.

778
01:19:08,481 --> 01:19:10,316
Move. Move.

779
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:20,159
No one wants a repeat of this morning.

780
01:19:20,910 --> 01:19:24,580
Keep your distance.
Clear the air space for five miles.

781
01:19:26,165 --> 01:19:27,500
They're on the move.

782
01:19:28,918 --> 01:19:30,461
Move, move.

783
01:19:42,056 --> 01:19:43,391
What?

784
01:19:48,437 --> 01:19:50,272
I know what you're thinking.

785
01:19:50,481 --> 01:19:52,108
You're thinking:

786
01:19:52,608 --> 01:19:55,361
If that launcher was a suppository...

787
01:19:55,611 --> 01:19:59,156
...would that bad man stick it
up my ass?

788
01:19:59,782 --> 01:20:04,119
Well, you eyeball me once more, boy...

789
01:20:04,328 --> 01:20:06,789
...I'll stick it so far up your ass...

790
01:20:06,956 --> 01:20:09,625
...you'll be begging me
for this bullet.

791
01:20:10,918 --> 01:20:13,504
This bus is your new holding area.

792
01:20:13,754 --> 01:20:18,300
If you don't test your collars,
this will all be over soon.

793
01:20:36,652 --> 01:20:38,695
Let's get this son of a bitch.

794
01:20:55,003 --> 01:21:00,425
- How can you justify all this?
- You're not looking at the big picture.

795
01:21:00,675 --> 01:21:02,219
Here's a scenario:

796
01:21:02,427 --> 01:21:05,347
You can cure all diseases,
but the price...

797
01:21:05,597 --> 01:21:09,935
...is that you must kill one
innocent child. Could you do it?

798
01:21:10,143 --> 01:21:11,144
No.

799
01:21:11,812 --> 01:21:14,731
You disappoint me.
It's the greatest good.

800
01:21:15,273 --> 01:21:19,861
- How about 10 innocents?
- Now you get it. How about 100? 1000?

801
01:21:20,111 --> 01:21:22,489
To preserve our way of life.

802
01:21:22,697 --> 01:21:26,117
No man has the right to make that
decision. You're just a terrorist.

803
01:21:26,368 --> 01:21:28,036
You're wrong, Stanley.

804
01:21:28,286 --> 01:21:32,332
Thousands die every day for no reason.
Where's your bleeding heart for them?

805
01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:36,252
You give $20 to Greenpeace
thinking you change the world.

806
01:21:36,461 --> 01:21:41,091
What country will harbor terrorists
when they see the consequences?

807
01:21:41,299 --> 01:21:45,595
Did you know I can buy nuclear
warheads in Minsk for 40 million?

808
01:21:45,804 --> 01:21:49,307
Hell, I buy half a dozen,
I even get a discount.

809
01:21:53,811 --> 01:21:56,648
Advise Joy 20 minutes ETA
at the airport.

810
01:21:56,856 --> 01:22:01,736
Control, please let A.D. Joy know
we're 20 minutes from the airport.

811
01:22:08,993 --> 01:22:11,412
- Ready?
- Bird's fueled, ready to go.

812
01:22:11,621 --> 01:22:14,916
- What about your pilot?
- He's in the works now.

813
01:22:15,416 --> 01:22:17,251
All right. Let's do it.

814
01:22:18,336 --> 01:22:22,924
Okay, I need a team over here.
The rest of you, let's go outside.

815
01:22:45,029 --> 01:22:45,988
Fuck!

816
01:22:50,868 --> 01:22:53,371
Jesus. What the fuck is he thinking?

817
01:22:57,124 --> 01:23:00,920
- Aren't we going to the airport?
- Misdirection, Stan.

818
01:23:07,927 --> 01:23:11,222
What are you doing?
Where are you taking the thing?

819
01:23:11,722 --> 01:23:16,268
You see Sugarland Express?
Didn't like the way it ended.

820
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,270
Pull over before you get-

821
01:23:39,333 --> 01:23:40,834
They can't be serious.

822
01:23:41,043 --> 01:23:42,252
Hold on!

823
01:23:55,641 --> 01:23:59,436
Attention control, this has
now become an aerial pursuit.

824
01:24:01,021 --> 01:24:03,899
I've also got people
across the tarmac.

825
01:24:04,149 --> 01:24:09,362
Sir, I've just been informed that
the bus is no longer en route to LAX.

826
01:24:09,529 --> 01:24:12,365
- What happened?
- It broke through the vehicles...

827
01:24:12,532 --> 01:24:17,162
- ... and turned onto First Street.
- All right. Let's go.

828
01:24:17,370 --> 01:24:21,166
Sir, the bus is no longer
on First Street.

829
01:24:23,710 --> 01:24:25,212
Then where is it?

830
01:24:26,755 --> 01:24:28,173
Airborne.

831
01:24:54,699 --> 01:24:58,369
- What's he doing?
- We have a strong wind condition.

832
01:24:58,578 --> 01:25:02,707
Tell him to climb!
Climb, goddamn it! Climb!

833
01:25:04,209 --> 01:25:05,752
Down! Everybody down!

834
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:17,472
Add action or excitement, or change
the direction of the entire campaign.

835
01:25:19,766 --> 01:25:22,727
Maybe we ought to rethink the visuals.

836
01:25:24,771 --> 01:25:26,230
Holy shit.

837
01:27:15,172 --> 01:27:17,716
Secure a perimeter
around the building.

838
01:27:17,883 --> 01:27:21,052
I want everybody out of
this lobby right now.

839
01:27:21,261 --> 01:27:25,557
Secure the elevators and stairs!
Anybody coming out, detain them!

840
01:27:27,767 --> 01:27:30,854
- What's going on?
- The elevators to the roof?

841
01:27:31,062 --> 01:27:33,398
- Up there.
- And the freight elevator?

842
01:27:33,607 --> 01:27:35,984
- Rear of the building.
- That way.

843
01:27:52,459 --> 01:27:54,127
Stan-man.

844
01:27:55,754 --> 01:27:58,965
Take care of your girl.
Maybe I'll see you around.

845
01:27:59,215 --> 01:28:01,926
No! It's not going to end like this.

846
01:28:02,177 --> 01:28:03,720
Come on, Stan.

847
01:28:03,928 --> 01:28:07,098
Not everything ends
as you think it should.

848
01:28:07,390 --> 01:28:08,391
Besides...

849
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:10,810
...audiences love happy endings.

850
01:28:20,903 --> 01:28:22,488
Stay here!

851
01:28:26,951 --> 01:28:28,494
Shit! Come on.

852
01:28:28,745 --> 01:28:30,246
Move, move!

853
01:28:39,755 --> 01:28:41,966
- No, Stanley!
- Come on.

854
01:28:52,810 --> 01:28:54,312
Get him out of here.

855
01:28:54,562 --> 01:28:56,355
Secure that weapon.

856
01:28:57,315 --> 01:28:58,649
Let's go.

857
01:29:04,613 --> 01:29:05,990
Gentlemen.

858
01:29:09,368 --> 01:29:12,037
You here to identify the body?

859
01:29:26,844 --> 01:29:30,764
The dentals match those
the Israeli government sent us...

860
01:29:31,015 --> 01:29:35,019
...for an ex-Mossad agent
named Gabriel Shear.

861
01:29:35,352 --> 01:29:36,770
Excuse me, sir.

862
01:29:39,231 --> 01:29:43,360
The DEA has no record of any
Ginger Knowles working for them.

863
01:29:43,569 --> 01:29:48,490
I checked all the hospitals and
morgues, and I can't find her body.

864
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:51,827
Look again.
Bodies just don't disappear.

865
01:29:52,870 --> 01:29:54,329
Right.

866
01:29:54,746 --> 01:29:56,957
He could make
an elephant disappear...

867
01:29:57,207 --> 01:30:00,460
...in a full theater.
You know how he did that?

868
01:30:00,669 --> 01:30:01,670
Misdirection.

869
01:30:01,879 --> 01:30:03,380
I'm DEA, Stanley.

870
01:30:03,672 --> 01:30:06,883
Give him the worm,
take the money and get out of here.

871
01:30:07,092 --> 01:30:10,429
What the eyes see and the ears hear,
the mind believes.

872
01:30:17,060 --> 01:30:19,062
Misdirection, Stan.

873
01:30:27,571 --> 01:30:31,074
This is a bad guy.
Nobody's going to miss him.

874
01:30:31,449 --> 01:30:35,745
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

875
01:30:36,913 --> 01:30:40,625
Why don't you get out of here?
Go see your daughter.

876
01:30:43,628 --> 01:30:44,754
Yeah, thanks.

877
01:30:46,548 --> 01:30:48,174
We'll be in touch.

878
01:30:52,887 --> 01:30:54,848
You son of a bitch.

879
01:31:02,105 --> 01:31:05,733
- Thank you. You're done?
- Yes, I'm full.

880
01:31:06,317 --> 01:31:08,111
Good. Let's go.

881
01:31:10,655 --> 01:31:14,617
So, navigator,
where's our next stop?

882
01:31:14,868 --> 01:31:16,786
- Holbrook.
- Holbrook.

883
01:31:17,829 --> 01:31:22,458
- So what's in Holbrook?
- The Petrified Forest, Dad.

884
01:31:24,002 --> 01:31:27,964
- I think you take the I-40 to the 180.
- Cool.

885
01:31:28,923 --> 01:31:30,591
Alrighty.

886
01:31:31,676 --> 01:31:34,804
- Are you okay, Dad?
- Yeah, I'm fine, sweetheart.

887
01:31:36,347 --> 01:31:37,765
Okay.

888
01:31:44,981 --> 01:31:47,817
Don't worry, Dad.
It's going to be okay.

889
01:31:47,984 --> 01:31:51,737
- We're going to be fine.
- I know, honey.

890
01:32:14,885 --> 01:32:17,721
I'd like to transfer money
from my employer's account.

891
01:32:17,888 --> 01:32:21,600
May I have your account number
and password, please?

892
01:32:21,976 --> 01:32:26,981
356126G. Password: Swordfish.

893
01:32:29,233 --> 01:32:31,694
How much would you like to transfer?

894
01:32:32,194 --> 01:32:35,656
All of it. Evenly over these accounts.

895
01:32:53,757 --> 01:32:55,425
It's done.

896
01:33:06,311 --> 01:33:09,731
In international news,
terrorist Allal bin-Hazzad...

897
01:33:09,982 --> 01:33:13,277
...was killed today
in an unexplained explosion...

898
01:33:13,527 --> 01:33:15,821
...on a yacht
in the Mediterranean.

899
01:33:16,029 --> 01:33:19,491
The elusive bin-Hazzad
was thought responsible for...

900
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:23,537
...the U. S. embassy bombing
in Istanbul earlier this month.

901
01:33:23,745 --> 01:33:28,250
This is the third killing of a
terrorist leader in as many weeks.
