1
00:01:20,665 --> 00:01:24,711
Thor! Wait for us!

2
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:39,476
Thor! Wait!

3
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,817
Thor! Wait!

4
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,201
Thor, don't do it!

5
00:02:01,498 --> 00:02:03,458
Thor, don't do it!

6
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:06,169
- It's dangerous!
- Don't do it!

7
00:02:19,224 --> 00:02:20,517
Come back, Thor!

8
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:21,976
Don't, Thor!

9
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:30,318
- Thor!
- Thor!

10
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:49,587
- Are you OK?
- Cold...

11
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:52,257
You were showing off again,
weren't you? Hm?

12
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:56,261
Thank God Erik
was able to save you.

13
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:58,221
God had nothing to do with it.

14
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:02,308
What got into you?
Why did you do it?

15
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:04,727
I hope you've
learned a lesson.

16
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:09,524
Promise me you'll never take a risk
like that ever again. Promise?

17
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,527
Promise?

18
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:33,047
Smile.

19
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:34,632
No, no, no.
There shouldn't be smiling.

20
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,595
Just be yourself.

21
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:44,642
Monsieur!

22
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:54,694
Liv! Liv!

23
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:58,698
So, no smiling.

24
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:01,784
You look very handsome.

25
00:04:24,891 --> 00:04:27,268
You'll make this island famous.

26
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:33,232
It will be just like
Darwin and the Galapagos.

27
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:37,987
When people hear of Fatu Hiva
they will think of Thor Heyerdahl.

28
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:53,544
Whoo!

29
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:05,515
Into the current.
No, into the current.

30
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:08,643
It's really heavy.

31
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:13,064
Listen, you said that Polynesia first
was populated from the west, right?

32
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:14,232
Yes.

33
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:20,113
Imagine paddling all the way
from Asia against the current.

34
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:22,865
They must have been
really strong.

35
00:05:25,702 --> 00:05:27,328
Yes.

36
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:35,503
Are you OK?

37
00:05:36,004 --> 00:05:37,505
I'm fine.

38
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:55,189
Listen to this. "Faa-hoka is
the Marquesan variety of pineapple.

39
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:59,652
It was found in abundance
by the first European explorers."

40
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:09,662
- Same pineapple?
- Indigenous, it says, to South America.

41
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:13,458
Maybe it can swim.

42
00:06:45,198 --> 00:06:48,076
Tiki, the sun god...

43
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:51,079
...brought us to these islands...

44
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,915
...from the land behind the ocean.

45
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:40,044
Tiki!

46
00:08:23,588 --> 00:08:27,633
- So how long are you in New York?
- Leaving in a few days.

47
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:30,595
- Going home for Christmas.
- Hm.

48
00:08:34,974 --> 00:08:38,519
The wise men
of anthropology are quite clear

49
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:41,939
that Polynesia was not
populated from the east.

50
00:08:42,106 --> 00:08:45,234
Wise men are not always right, sir.

51
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,451
Look around you. Every book in here
offers some theory or another.

52
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:57,121
Most written by one man,
read by perhaps only ten,

53
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:58,915
of whom nine disagreed
with the theory.

54
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:01,959
But my theory provides evidence

55
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:04,253
that Polynesia was
settled from the east.

56
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,881
I've spent ten years writing
and researching my thesis.

57
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:11,469
I lived on Fatu Hiva, professor.
I lived my theory.

58
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,764
How many publishers
have you seen before me?

59
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:18,267
The fact that I'm your last hope
ought to tell you something.

60
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:22,355
Yes, that scientific publishing
is completely closed to new ideas.

61
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:26,609
You claim that the Peruvian
pre-Incan civilization

62
00:09:26,776 --> 00:09:28,027
was remarkable, I agree.

63
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:30,196
And that the prevailing
winds and currents

64
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:32,490
in the Pacific down there
move from east to west.

65
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:36,577
But it is also the case that Tiki
could not have traveled to Polynesia

66
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:40,081
- because his people had no boats!
- No.

67
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,833
But they had rafts.

68
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,919
They had balsa wood rafts.

69
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:46,837
Rafts!

70
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:50,800
Now that would be evidence.

71
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:53,469
You want your theory to be accepted?
Then, go ahead.

72
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:58,766
Drift from Peru to Polynesia
on a balsa wood raft.

73
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:00,559
Good luck.

74
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,982
Mr.
Brownberg's here to see you, professor.

75
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:09,944
Gentlemen.

76
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:12,947
Your magazine will
be with me on a raft

77
00:10:13,114 --> 00:10:16,742
at the mercy of the winds,
all the way to Polynesia.

78
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:19,912
It's further than from
Chicago to Moscow.

79
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:25,167
Here to here, 5,000 miles.

80
00:10:27,837 --> 00:10:30,756
You'll have some sort of engine
in case of emergency?

81
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:33,592
Absolutely not.
We will surrender to the current

82
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:36,971
and the wind,
exactly as Tiki did.

83
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:40,433
And by undertaking this extraordinary
voyage, you are proving...?

84
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:45,104
That the oceans were not
barriers, but roads.

85
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:48,232
Not impediments, but pathways.

86
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,986
I will prove that
South American people

87
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:56,073
sailed to Polynesia 1,500 years ago.

88
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,035
Every schoolboy knows that Polynesia
was peopled from Asia,

89
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:00,369
not South America.

90
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:04,081
And it's my job as a scientist
to prove the schoolboys,

91
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:07,668
and those who quote them, wrong.

92
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:13,007
- Being sun worshipers...
- Mr. Heyerdahl.

93
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:16,344
Doubtless, the story of Norwegians
drowning in the Pacific will sell

94
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,554
a lot of magazines,
but not this one.

95
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:20,931
This is a scientific expedition...

96
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,726
Our magazine has a higher
purpose than to finance

97
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:25,978
and enable men bent on suicide.

98
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:29,231
I doubt you'll have any
success in recruiting anyone.

99
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,609
So, a dozen logs

100
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:36,530
lashed together,
big balsa wood logs, like that.

101
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:41,619
A hut for five crew.
All very capable, of course.

102
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:44,705
Mast and rudder...

103
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:49,293
And, uh, there it is.

104
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,128
The Kon-Tiki.

105
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:57,760
I spent 22 days on a raft. Torpedoed.
North Atlantic, winter of - 43.

106
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:01,597
You can't sail it, steer it.

107
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:03,974
All you can do is sit there
and wait to die.

108
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:06,394
- No, no, no.
- These logs, they are gonna

109
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,062
move against each other in the waves,

110
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:10,689
and eventually they're gonna
break the lashings.

111
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:13,818
And you'll each be sitting on a log
floating your separate ways

112
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:16,320
at the mercy of the elements.

113
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:21,700
Thank you for your time.

114
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:39,510
- Hey...
- Excuse me.

115
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:41,762
- You're Norwegian, right? Back there...
- Yes?

116
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:43,639
...I couldn't help overhearing.

117
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:46,600
Back there I couldn't help overhearing
about your raft. Interesting.

118
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,854
- Are you a sailor?
- No. And neither are you.

119
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,564
Let me show you something.

120
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,364
That will lessen the drag a lot.

121
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:02,324
We engineers can't help ourselves.

122
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:04,160
- You're an engineer?
- Yeah.

123
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:06,495
But nowadays I mostly
sell refrigerators.

124
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:08,372
Herman Watzinger.

125
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:14,753
- Thor Heyerdahl.
- So you're going on a raft, are you?

126
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,216
...the evidence is
just overwhelming, you know?

127
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:22,136
It's possible to actually
drift there on the current.

128
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:26,348
The wind and the current.
That's the key, and I've got that.

129
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:30,060
Five months to finance, equip
and mount the entire expedition.

130
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:31,562
So there's a lot to do.

131
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:34,023
- Mr. Heyerdahl, may I help you?
- We have an appointment.

132
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,067
The money in place by Christmas,
buy the balsa in January...

133
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:39,320
Mr. Heyerdahl,
you are not on the list.

134
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:42,364
Look under his name.
Watzinger. W.

135
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:46,619
Get a crew down to Peru in February,
build in March, sail in April,

136
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:50,539
land by August and hope
the hurricane season starts late.

137
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,210
Just following my instincts...

138
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:55,628
Peter Freuchen.

139
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,755
We damn near died
when the zipper froze.

140
00:13:57,922 --> 00:14:00,424
We all walk in his shadow.

141
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:02,343
Mr. Heyerdahl, you are
not allowed in here.

142
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,596
Well! My friend from Fatu Hiva!

143
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:08,599
You look like a man who just got
dumped by a glossy magazine!

144
00:14:10,476 --> 00:14:13,812
Thank you.

145
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:21,570
Don't worry, Heyerdahl.

146
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:24,031
Scientific committees, my ass.

147
00:14:25,074 --> 00:14:28,953
- Am I right, McGregor? Or am I right?
- Always. Of course.

148
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,330
Frostbite, the winter of - 24.

149
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:35,876
do as the
natives do, down to the smallest detail.

150
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:38,254
Don't use nails if they use rope,

151
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,714
don't use steel if they use bone.

152
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:43,217
It took their ancestors
a thousand years to learn.

153
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:46,887
Go with them, and you just
might hang on to your leg.

154
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:51,225
Skol.

155
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:53,852
Whoo!

156
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,950
I'm 32 years old.

157
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:14,665
I'm a refrigerator salesman, stuck in
a marriage that doesn't go anywhere.

158
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:18,168
And I- d really like to go
on that raft with you.

159
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,131
OK, I know it's going
to be dangerous,

160
00:15:22,298 --> 00:15:25,968
but you have no idea how risky
the fridge business is.

161
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,102
There will be no one
to save us out there.

162
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,149
Except your theory.

163
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:46,196
Captain.

164
00:15:52,328 --> 00:15:55,873
At least you won't
lose your leg to frostbite.

165
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:00,628
You know,
Bamse's convinced you're Santa.

166
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,671
Oh, I hope you tell him
it's not like that.

167
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:06,342
Well, you tell him.
They are just so excited.

168
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:08,510
It will be so good
to have you home, Thor.

169
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:13,599
Yes, Liv... I couldn't
raise the money for the trip, so uh...

170
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:16,894
...I have to go directly
to Peru now,

171
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:20,105
and see if I can borrow
enough money.

172
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,280
Are you...

173
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:32,034
Are you not coming home?

174
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:38,540
It has been difficult, Liv.
Really difficult.

175
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:41,960
And I just can't keep
begging anymore.

176
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:45,214
Don't do this.

177
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:48,175
I have to, Liv.

178
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:51,178
Don't do this to the children.

179
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:54,932
Don't you understand?
If I come home now, I'm finished.

180
00:16:57,309 --> 00:17:01,230
I spent ten years working on this, Liv.
I spent ten years.

181
00:17:01,397 --> 00:17:04,066
You can't even swim.

182
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,409
You should have come home, Thor.

183
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:16,161
- And, if not...
- Liv...

184
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:19,623
you should have asked me
to go with you.

185
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,126
- Liv...
- You know I would have said no.

186
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:23,460
- Liv...
- Because of the children.

187
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:26,130
Come and meet us in Tahiti.

188
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:32,469
Bring the boys.
And we can show them Fatu Hiva.

189
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:35,431
This is the operator. Your
collect call will end in ten seconds.

190
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:38,142
Just one moment, please?
Thank you.

191
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:42,855
Liv?

192
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:45,524
Merry Christmas, Thor.

193
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,986
Merry Christmas.

194
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,810
- Ready?
- Yes.

195
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:55,260
You all made it! Oh, now I'm happy.

196
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:58,222
You- d better be. I spent three
weeks getting here, you bastard.

197
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:01,099
- Thor.
- Hi. This is Herman Watzinger,

198
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:03,060
- my second-in-command.
- Hello.

199
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:07,481
For the simple reason that without him,
there couldn't be any first-in-command.

200
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:10,192
- Herman.
- Herman, these are my two

201
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:12,194
brilliant radio operators.

202
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:15,656
Torstein, war hero,
nervous system made of asbestos.

203
00:19:15,823 --> 00:19:19,159
And as far as we know, he has only
- whiskey and women.

204
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:21,703
Knut Haugland.

205
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,413
Also a war hero.

206
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,668
And I know Knut hates this,
but I have to call him a legend,

207
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:28,961
because that's what you are.

208
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:33,090
- Erik, Erik Hesselberg.
- Not a legend.

209
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:35,342
But you saved my life.

210
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:37,636
Erik and I grew up together.

211
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:41,974
And Erik has one unique quality
that just might be useful to us.

212
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,102
Erik has actually
been to sea before.

213
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,188
- Now...
- Since you didn't introduce yourself,

214
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,815
I Will.

215
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:53,193
This... this is Thor.

216
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,906
He's stubborn, egotistical,
lawfully ambitious...

217
00:19:58,073 --> 00:19:59,700
But he's also a leader.

218
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:02,369
Because of that,
we are going to do what Tiki did.

219
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,788
We are going to build a raft.

220
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:07,708
- And...
- And drift into the sunset.

221
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,210
- ...drift into the sunset.
- Where is the raft?

222
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:11,920
You're sitting on it.

223
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,590
There you go.

224
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:19,887
- That's what we- re building?
- Yes.

225
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:22,556
Exactly that,
down to the smallest detail.

226
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:28,353
We'll use the same methods, the same
materials as Tiki did 1,500 years ago.

227
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:34,192
This is extremely important. Everything
depends on it. I hope that's clear.

228
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,111
All I brought was a radio
and a pocketknife.

229
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:38,196
- We- re going to need a ton of supplies.
- Of course.

230
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:42,284
Once the money comes through,
we will buy what we need.

231
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:44,453
That's it.

232
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,459
Sefior Heyerdahl?
Jose Bustamente.

233
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:54,087
Your Excellency.
Thank you for seeing me.

234
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:57,049
So, what can I do for you?

235
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,426
Actually, I'm here to tell you about
something I can do for you.

236
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:03,221
- And what might that be?
- By crossing the Pacific

237
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:07,184
for 5,000 miles,
I will prove that Peruvians

238
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:10,270
were the first
to settle Polynesia.

239
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:16,109
What? Peruvians...
discovered Polynesia?

240
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:19,404
And how may I help you?

241
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:24,451
So the president of Peru
calls the American admiral

242
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:27,746
and the admiral says we can
have anything we want.

243
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:30,499
In return, we have to invade
Polynesia on behalf of Peru?

244
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,460
And you thought he was a waiter?

245
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:36,505
...thermometers, battle rations,
powdered soups, floating knives,

246
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:40,634
desalination tablets, dinghies, fishing
tackle, canned food, shark repellant...

247
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:41,927
- Does it work?
- What?

248
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:44,638
- The shark repellent?
- That's what we want you to find out.

249
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:58,819
- Thor Heyerdahl.
- Yes?

250
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:01,822
My name is Bengt Daniels-son.

251
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:04,950
- I'm a bit busy.
- I came across this yesterday.

252
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:11,289
So now you want to tell me that
the first wave will tip the raft over,

253
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,251
or we will sink two weeks out,
or what do you think?

254
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:15,585
- Giant squid?
- No.

255
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:18,505
I wanna show you
how to assemble that camera.

256
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:31,393
- Here you go.
- You're a photographer.

257
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,439
No. Ethnographer.
Just spent a year up the Amazon.

258
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:37,941
- But you know how to use the camera?
- Yes.

259
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:40,110
Let me join you on the raft,
and I'll show you.

260
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:44,781
There's money to be made
in a documentary... done right.

261
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:09,157
Thor, I've been thinking.
What about a sea trial?

262
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:11,201
Just for a few days.

263
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:13,745
We could still leave before
the hurricane season starts.

264
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:16,665
- No, it's too risky.
- Risky?

265
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:19,793
Risky. And besides,
Tiki already made the sea trial.

266
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,549
- Here's to Tiki!
- Skol!

267
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:28,802
- Tiki!
- Skol!

268
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:33,890
Excuse me.

269
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:39,146
Us! Tripulantes!

270
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:40,939
Tripulantes!

271
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:44,985
No, you loco!

272
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:48,613
I'm just calling
to say goodbye, Liv.

273
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,575
We- re leaving in a few hours.

274
00:24:52,576 --> 00:24:56,872
- Goodbye, Thor.
- I brought medicines this time. Plenty.

275
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:00,458
- I hope you don't have to use them.
- What?

276
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:05,463
- I hope you don't have to use them.
- Yeah. Me too.

277
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:11,303
- The boys wish you good luck.
- Thank you.

278
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:13,138
You?

279
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:17,309
Don't be angry, Liv.

280
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:26,776
If I pull this off, Liv, our lives
will be completely different.

281
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:29,446
No more struggling.

282
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:36,036
I just hope that 100 days from now
your children still have a father.

283
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:38,455
What did you say?

284
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:44,169
Nothing, Thor. Nothing.

285
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:48,840
You're breaking up, Liv.
I'm sorry.

286
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:53,845
I'm sorry, Liv...
I called to say goodbye.

287
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,114
Whoa!

288
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,644
Thor, this way!

289
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:27,772
Hey!

290
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:24,120
Hey, Torstein, help me with this.

291
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:28,500
We need to secure this box.

292
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:36,549
No, no, no, there's plenty
of space right there.

293
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:52,357
If we get a westerly now,
it'll take us right back to Callao.

294
00:28:52,524 --> 00:28:56,319
No, Tiki- s wind came
from the south.

295
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:05,954
Now pull it up, Thor.

296
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:13,962
- Ow!
- Are you OK?

297
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:15,588
More line starboard.

298
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:18,967
More line starboard.

299
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:22,804
- Which way is starboard?
- Right! Christ.

300
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:26,057
Nope. Nothing.

301
00:29:26,224 --> 00:29:28,184
It's the wrong course.

302
00:29:28,351 --> 00:29:30,311
- We have no steering.
- That's fine, that's fine.

303
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:33,940
Let's use the oar.
Keep it pointing forward.

304
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:36,276
Excellent work, boys.

305
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,885
You can just sit back and relax.

306
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:07,640
In 100 days, you can start your own
Peruvian colony in Polynesia.

307
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,393
That's not too bad.

308
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:16,024
I would like it better
if we were moving towards it.

309
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,074
You might want to take
the lens cap off.

310
00:30:45,428 --> 00:30:47,889
And only 100 days to go.

311
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:10,787
Thor?

312
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:14,874
Remember those sailors
in the bar in New York?

313
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:17,460
Who said the logs would move
and break the ropes?

314
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:18,753
Hm-mm.

315
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:24,842
Perhaps we should
have used wire.

316
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:29,514
The ropes held 1,500 years ago,
and they will hold now.

317
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:33,560
If you can't trust Tiki,
you can trust me.

318
00:31:35,228 --> 00:31:36,563
Yeah.

319
00:32:02,255 --> 00:32:05,425
Does anyone know
if we can eat them?

320
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:08,678
Flying fish.

321
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:13,349
Should be a delicious blend
of herring and grouse.

322
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:18,229
Herman, grab onto something.

323
00:32:18,396 --> 00:32:21,316
If you fall overboard,
you stay overboard.

324
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:23,860
We won't be able to turn around.

325
00:32:28,281 --> 00:32:30,825
Thank God one of us
has been to sea before.

326
00:32:31,826 --> 00:32:34,120
I've heard that drowning
is the best way to die.

327
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:38,833
Well, not exactly.
You might manage for a minute,

328
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,419
until you breathe out of reflex.

329
00:32:41,586 --> 00:32:44,047
Your lungs fill with water,
you choke,

330
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:47,383
and the, uh, acid created by
the salt water in your stomach

331
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:50,094
makes you feel like
you burn up inside.

332
00:32:50,261 --> 00:32:53,389
Panic makes your heart kick in,
forcing you to breathe again.

333
00:32:53,556 --> 00:32:55,558
More water.

334
00:32:55,725 --> 00:33:01,522
You lose control,
and then you finally die.

335
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:04,651
All in all,
three or four minutes.

336
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:07,695
Hold on. What about my life
flashing past?

337
00:33:07,862 --> 00:33:10,698
Yeah, that's the worst part.

338
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:22,126
Damn this radio!

339
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:26,214
- Forget it, Torstein.
- Excuse me?

340
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:28,257
- Just forget it.
- Forget it?

341
00:33:28,424 --> 00:33:29,592
What do you mean, forget it?

342
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:31,886
The Andes.
There's nothing we can do.

343
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:35,139
The Andes are hundreds
of miles away.

344
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:38,017
OK? Just stay in bed.

345
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:40,812
We can't risk you vomiting
all over the radio.

346
00:33:42,772 --> 00:33:44,190
I need radio contact.

347
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:48,945
Money follows attention, and
I'm the one who has to pay for this.

348
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:52,615
That's right, Thor.
Keep filming.

349
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:56,035
Look, all I need is to be able
to contact the Coast Guard.

350
00:33:56,202 --> 00:34:01,165
They- d never make it out here in time
anyway. I mean, if something happened.

351
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:10,383
North-northwest, that's good.

352
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:14,721
And what we want is west.

353
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:20,810
The South Equatorial Current
is the only road there is.

354
00:34:20,977 --> 00:34:23,062
I know.

355
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:26,983
So... how do we get down to it?

356
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:31,404
As navigator,
I can tell you this.

357
00:34:31,571 --> 00:34:36,284
If you can't steer, you can't
push yourself to change course.

358
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:48,129
Oh...

359
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:54,177
Should we wake the others?

360
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:57,764
No. It's nothing.

361
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:00,975
We'll let them sleep.

362
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:07,190
Everyone on deck! Come on!

363
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:09,108
Torstein!

364
00:35:11,736 --> 00:35:13,863
Get the sail down!

365
00:35:16,407 --> 00:35:18,075
Thor!

366
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:22,413
Aah!

367
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,597
Tie yourself, Thor.

368
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,891
Tie yourselves!

369
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:44,435
Get the sail down!

370
00:35:44,602 --> 00:35:47,021
Tie yourselves!

371
00:36:00,701 --> 00:36:02,703
Get the sail down!

372
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:09,961
Just cut it down!

373
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,552
Just cut it!

374
00:36:25,101 --> 00:36:27,478
Thor! Thor!

375
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:43,911
Thor, grab my hand!
Grab my hand!

376
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:46,873
Thor!

377
00:38:25,805 --> 00:38:27,682
That wasn't too bad.

378
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:33,187
- Hey.
- Twelve degrees,

379
00:38:33,354 --> 00:38:36,524
five minutes, two seconds south.

380
00:38:38,067 --> 00:38:41,153
Eighty degrees north-northwest.

381
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,954
Fifty-two-point-eight
nautical miles.

382
00:38:52,206 --> 00:38:55,876
That makes two-point-two knots.

383
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:02,008
That's quite good.

384
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:05,553
Still too northerly.

385
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,139
This is where we are
after four days.

386
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:10,141
So the worst thing
that can happen is that

387
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:11,976
we drift back to the coast, right?

388
00:39:12,143 --> 00:39:14,854
No, the worst thing that
can happen is we get carried up

389
00:39:15,021 --> 00:39:17,648
into the maelstrom
south of Galapagos.

390
00:39:17,815 --> 00:39:19,775
That's where we- re
heading right now.

391
00:39:19,942 --> 00:39:22,153
I never heard about maelstroms
around Galapagos.

392
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:24,989
Please, Thor, I'm serious. Look.

393
00:39:25,156 --> 00:39:27,950
We'll be fine. Have faith.

394
00:39:29,577 --> 00:39:31,245
I have faith.

395
00:39:32,288 --> 00:39:34,206
Problem is I also have a sextant.

396
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:40,171
The Galapagos maelstrom,
a gigantic vortex,

397
00:39:40,337 --> 00:39:44,008
creates waves over nine meters
high and its powerful roar

398
00:39:44,175 --> 00:39:46,510
can be heard ten miles away.

399
00:39:47,845 --> 00:39:50,056
Even has a nice illustration.

400
00:40:11,494 --> 00:40:14,580
- We need it higher.
- Take it higher.

401
00:40:16,165 --> 00:40:18,876
OK, higher!

402
00:40:26,175 --> 00:40:27,468
There...

403
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:29,637
- We've got something.
- Yes?

404
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:32,807
His name is Hal.
Transmitting from Los Angeles.

405
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:34,767
Can you relay messages to the press?

406
00:40:35,935 --> 00:40:37,353
Thor is out of debt.

407
00:40:39,438 --> 00:40:41,524
I lost him.

408
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,902
No, no, no, no! Oh!

409
00:40:45,945 --> 00:40:48,531
Stupid, stupid, stupid bird.

410
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:50,908
Hey! Just leave her.

411
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:59,834
Whose idea was it
to bring that bird anyway?

412
00:42:19,955 --> 00:42:21,290
Bengt. Bengt!

413
00:42:21,457 --> 00:42:24,710
Camera. Get the camera!

414
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:35,346
Get the camera! Bengt! Bengt!

415
00:42:35,512 --> 00:42:37,139
Get the camera!

416
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:55,449
- Completely harmless.
- Harmless, are you crazy?

417
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:57,993
That one can tip us over
just like that.

418
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,579
- In Vietnam, it's a deity.
- They call it "Ca Ong."

419
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:01,747
It means Sir Fish.

420
00:43:01,914 --> 00:43:06,001
- Bengt, the camera.
- Right.

421
00:43:09,505 --> 00:43:10,547
Here it comes.

422
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,701
- Bengt, where's the camera?
- I'm loading it!

423
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:46,792
Aah!

424
00:43:46,959 --> 00:43:49,211
- It's trying to overturn us!
- No, it's just feeding off the raft.

425
00:43:49,378 --> 00:43:50,546
Don't worry.

426
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:55,509
Where are you?

427
00:44:05,227 --> 00:44:07,146
Look at that.

428
00:44:22,036 --> 00:44:24,246
Hey. Put that away.

429
00:44:34,256 --> 00:44:35,883
- No!
- Yah!

430
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:53,525
Erik!

431
00:44:57,446 --> 00:44:59,114
- Erik!
- Get him up!

432
00:45:05,329 --> 00:45:08,207
I've got you.
It's all right. I got you.

433
00:45:08,374 --> 00:45:10,876
Herman! Herman!
Are you deaf?!

434
00:45:11,043 --> 00:45:13,128
He told you to put
the harpoon away!

435
00:45:13,295 --> 00:45:15,464
- He wanted to tip us over.
- It's all right.

436
00:45:15,631 --> 00:45:17,049
Obey your orders!

437
00:45:19,343 --> 00:45:21,345
It's all right.

438
00:45:25,057 --> 00:45:26,266
I'm sorry.

439
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:35,109
- He didn't listen.
- No, he didn't. I know.

440
00:45:35,275 --> 00:45:37,528
But it's my job to tell him that,
not yours.

441
00:45:37,694 --> 00:45:40,322
He sells refrigerators.

442
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:43,742
He got frightened.
It happens.

443
00:45:59,675 --> 00:46:01,427
How are you?

444
00:46:01,593 --> 00:46:03,262
Fine.

445
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:14,898
Yeah.

446
00:46:15,941 --> 00:46:20,028
People who can't get rid
of their demons try this.

447
00:46:20,195 --> 00:46:22,406
Drifting across the Pacific.

448
00:46:26,118 --> 00:46:27,327
Hey, Lorita.

449
00:46:50,601 --> 00:46:52,936
Thor, um...

450
00:46:53,979 --> 00:46:55,981
About the shark
or the whale or...

451
00:46:56,148 --> 00:46:59,693
- Is Knut OK?
- He's fine.

452
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,487
Don't worry.

453
00:47:06,366 --> 00:47:09,995
Why the oar?

454
00:47:10,162 --> 00:47:13,248
Trying to catch the
South Equatorial bus.

455
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:17,544
Unless we already
missed the stop.

456
00:47:17,711 --> 00:47:20,506
We won't.

457
00:47:20,672 --> 00:47:22,424
We could have.

458
00:47:24,384 --> 00:47:26,887
No.

459
00:47:27,054 --> 00:47:28,514
We couldn't.

460
00:49:08,322 --> 00:49:10,741
Building a life raft?

461
00:49:10,907 --> 00:49:12,951
No, it's for my daughter.

462
00:49:13,118 --> 00:49:15,162
She's six months old.

463
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:21,460
We just don't have enough power.

464
00:49:21,627 --> 00:49:23,211
It's not about the wattage.

465
00:49:23,378 --> 00:49:27,382
Oh! Oh, come on!

466
00:49:35,766 --> 00:49:37,809
Put out that cigarette.

467
00:50:16,807 --> 00:50:18,809
Look.

468
00:50:20,185 --> 00:50:22,229
There's something down there.

469
00:50:51,508 --> 00:50:53,301
Look at that.

470
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:55,971
Look at that.

471
00:51:08,817 --> 00:51:11,069
Shark protection.

472
00:51:11,236 --> 00:51:13,864
Right. I see.

473
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:16,825
- So are you going down?
- No. Bengt is.

474
00:51:16,992 --> 00:51:19,077
That's right. Send the Swede.

475
00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:07,125
Shark.

476
00:52:17,803 --> 00:52:21,348
It's getting waterlogged.
Just as you showed me.

477
00:52:22,808 --> 00:52:24,643
Showed?

478
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:27,771
I broke off a piece
and threw it overboard.

479
00:52:27,938 --> 00:52:29,856
Sank like a stone.

480
00:52:30,023 --> 00:52:32,526
The raft is absorbing water.

481
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:36,321
- It looks worse than it is.
- We- re not even on the right course.

482
00:52:48,124 --> 00:52:52,045
You just earned yourself another
dog watch. Let's get back to work.

483
00:52:52,212 --> 00:52:54,130
This is not a holiday.

484
00:53:27,622 --> 00:53:29,791
There. Got him.

485
00:53:29,958 --> 00:53:32,419
Ready?

486
00:53:32,586 --> 00:53:34,504
Um... yes.

487
00:53:36,172 --> 00:53:40,218
Royal Norwegian Embassy,
Washington, D.C.

488
00:53:40,385 --> 00:53:44,055
Thor Heyerdahl, Kon-Tiki,
May 16th, 1947.

489
00:53:44,222 --> 00:53:48,018
Zero-niner degrees,
36 minutes, 58 seconds south.

490
00:53:48,184 --> 00:53:50,103
The raft is keeping up well.

491
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:54,316
We are on our way, and morale is high.

492
00:53:55,984 --> 00:54:00,196
Having had problems with the radio, we
have been unable to establish contact.

493
00:54:00,363 --> 00:54:04,451
Wind conditions are stable
and we are traveling an average speed...

494
00:54:07,203 --> 00:54:09,539
- You all right?
- Yep.

495
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:13,668
- Sure about this?
- People will want to see

496
00:54:13,835 --> 00:54:15,503
a picture of the raft
in the ocean.

497
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:17,088
Around your wrist.

498
00:54:17,255 --> 00:54:20,133
It's about 5,000 meters deep,
so don't drop it.

499
00:55:48,555 --> 00:55:50,724
Thor! Shark!

500
00:55:53,143 --> 00:55:56,104
- Get it up! Get it up!
- Don't jerk the rope!

501
00:55:58,648 --> 00:56:00,025
Take my hand. Take my hand!

502
00:56:00,608 --> 00:56:02,110
Grab my hand!

503
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,950
I'm fine.

504
00:56:10,493 --> 00:56:12,662
Bengt. Bengt!

505
00:56:12,829 --> 00:56:15,040
Why are you giving the sharks
oursoup?

506
00:56:15,206 --> 00:56:17,042
It's the shark repellant
the Americans gave us.

507
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:19,294
No, it isn't.
It's tomato soup.

508
00:56:21,588 --> 00:56:23,381
Where's the shark repellent?

509
00:56:23,548 --> 00:56:25,508
Well, I guess we ate it then.

510
00:57:21,022 --> 00:57:22,524
Lorita!

511
00:57:26,778 --> 00:57:29,948
Lorita! Lorita!

512
00:57:32,784 --> 00:57:35,703
No!

513
00:58:49,027 --> 00:58:50,653
Watch your feet!

514
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:53,406
Whoo!

515
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:08,213
Stop! This is madness!
We'll only attract more sharks!

516
00:59:22,852 --> 00:59:24,979
Aah!

517
01:00:11,985 --> 01:00:13,987
Please.

518
01:00:14,153 --> 01:00:16,489
It's our only chance.

519
01:00:20,243 --> 01:00:23,162
Our only hope now is to try
to strengthen the lashings.

520
01:00:23,329 --> 01:00:25,665
Tie her together.

521
01:00:25,832 --> 01:00:27,375
Don't you see?

522
01:00:29,711 --> 01:00:32,922
We built this raft
exactly the way Tiki did.

523
01:00:33,089 --> 01:00:36,009
And we'll get there
just as he did.

524
01:00:37,343 --> 01:00:38,761
Have faith.

525
01:00:38,928 --> 01:00:42,307
Faith?

526
01:00:43,808 --> 01:00:46,811
This isn't religion, Thor.

527
01:00:46,978 --> 01:00:49,022
This is insane.

528
01:00:51,149 --> 01:00:53,443
This is bigger than us.

529
01:00:57,613 --> 01:00:59,490
Please.

530
01:01:01,284 --> 01:01:05,413
Look at the logs.
Feel the raft.

531
01:01:06,622 --> 01:01:08,082
I'm begging you.

532
01:01:08,249 --> 01:01:13,046
All I'm asking is just a little
safety with modern materials.

533
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,007
Please?

534
01:01:25,975 --> 01:01:27,518
No!

535
01:01:30,605 --> 01:01:33,024
No!

536
01:02:00,843 --> 01:02:03,971
At least I won't lose
my leg to frostbite.

537
01:02:22,949 --> 01:02:24,075
Herman!

538
01:02:25,493 --> 01:02:26,911
Herman, grab the rope!

539
01:02:27,078 --> 01:02:29,122
Hold on! Hold on!

540
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:34,460
Grab the oar!

541
01:02:35,753 --> 01:02:38,506
Hang on!

542
01:02:49,767 --> 01:02:51,978
Throw the shark overboard!

543
01:03:00,236 --> 01:03:02,321
Pull it in again!

544
01:03:03,948 --> 01:03:05,783
Throw it out!

545
01:03:06,451 --> 01:03:10,246
Herman!

546
01:03:31,267 --> 01:03:33,436
Knut, no!

547
01:05:11,617 --> 01:05:15,371
Three years ago,
I shot four men.

548
01:05:19,041 --> 01:05:22,503
The Gestapo finally
found me with my radio.

549
01:05:26,924 --> 01:05:31,846
- It was war.
- Yeah.

550
01:05:32,013 --> 01:05:33,639
Tor-stein says the same.

551
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:40,813
He helped sink the Tirpitz.
A thousand men went down.

552
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:43,608
That doesn't bother him.

553
01:05:47,028 --> 01:05:48,571
Thank you.

554
01:05:51,365 --> 01:05:53,576
You saved my life.

555
01:05:55,953 --> 01:05:57,955
That's what I mean.

556
01:05:58,122 --> 01:06:00,249
Thank you.

557
01:06:24,273 --> 01:06:27,026
I couldn't have saved you.

558
01:06:29,654 --> 01:06:32,323
I couldn't have saved you.

559
01:06:37,662 --> 01:06:40,331
I can't swim.

560
01:06:43,876 --> 01:06:46,087
I know.

561
01:06:49,382 --> 01:06:51,300
We all know.

562
01:08:04,081 --> 01:08:05,624
What time is it?

563
01:08:08,878 --> 01:08:10,755
Ten past two.

564
01:08:13,632 --> 01:08:17,720
- You sure about that?
- Yes. Ten past two.

565
01:08:27,104 --> 01:08:30,191
- We need to talk.
- Yes?

566
01:08:36,655 --> 01:08:38,908
We- re on the South Equatorial.

567
01:08:39,074 --> 01:08:40,826
Heading straight for Polynesia.

568
01:08:46,123 --> 01:08:48,334
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

569
01:08:48,501 --> 01:08:52,296
My God!

570
01:08:56,592 --> 01:09:00,095
Look at that! Look at that!
We found it!

571
01:09:05,643 --> 01:09:09,855
- Is that it? Are we there?
- Whoo-hoo!

572
01:09:11,732 --> 01:09:13,901
- I knew it! You see?
- No, you didn't!

573
01:09:14,068 --> 01:09:17,947
I knew it!

574
01:09:20,783 --> 01:09:22,201
Herman.

575
01:09:25,246 --> 01:09:28,123
At last!
Hey, let me have one.

576
01:10:09,081 --> 01:10:11,125
You didn't doubt it, did you?

577
01:10:20,801 --> 01:10:24,889
On course, and shipshape,
we have now passed the critical point.

578
01:10:25,055 --> 01:10:26,724
And spirits are high.

579
01:10:28,142 --> 01:10:30,936
Every nautical mile
is a nautical mile

580
01:10:31,103 --> 01:10:34,315
closer to the proof
I have sought.

581
01:10:43,365 --> 01:10:47,870
Early man did not see
the ocean as a barrier,

582
01:10:48,037 --> 01:10:51,582
but rather as a means
of communication.

583
01:10:59,965 --> 01:11:04,637
This is science that cannot
be done behind a desk

584
01:11:04,803 --> 01:11:06,472
or by a committee.

585
01:11:07,848 --> 01:11:10,267
One thousand
five hundred years ago,

586
01:11:10,434 --> 01:11:14,563
a South American civilization
possessed the maritime

587
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:16,690
and navigational skills

588
01:11:16,857 --> 01:11:19,860
to successfully maneuver
a balsa wood raft

589
01:11:20,027 --> 01:11:23,447
over 5, 000 miles.

590
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:30,704
We are using the same stars
as they did.

591
01:11:36,293 --> 01:11:40,631
It's as if we- re the only human
beings left in the universe.

592
01:11:40,798 --> 01:11:42,967
Maybe we are.

593
01:11:43,133 --> 01:11:46,011
Maybe they've dropped
more bombs on each other.

594
01:11:47,262 --> 01:11:49,932
Every city like Hiroshima.

595
01:11:50,099 --> 01:11:53,227
Then we wouldn't
have radio contact, Bengt.

596
01:11:56,313 --> 01:11:59,316
Maybe nature has
just accepted us.

597
01:12:00,317 --> 01:12:02,861
As a part of itself.

598
01:12:03,028 --> 01:12:05,990
Like a fish or a... or a bird.

599
01:14:40,102 --> 01:14:42,104
Bird...

600
01:14:43,313 --> 01:14:45,149
A bird!

601
01:14:45,858 --> 01:14:48,527
Hey!

602
01:14:50,362 --> 01:14:52,281
Hey, look! A bird!

603
01:14:55,701 --> 01:14:57,578
What's going on?

604
01:15:03,959 --> 01:15:05,627
Look!

605
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:44,791
Whoo-hoo!

606
01:15:51,548 --> 01:15:53,967
Five thousand miles behind us,

607
01:15:54,134 --> 01:15:57,346
and the worst danger
lies just ahead.

608
01:15:57,512 --> 01:16:00,599
- Human beings, right?
- No.

609
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,435
The Raroia reef.

610
01:16:03,602 --> 01:16:07,231
A barrier of underwater
razor blades.

611
01:16:07,397 --> 01:16:08,982
Why didn't you
mention that before?

612
01:16:09,149 --> 01:16:13,237
There was no way of knowing
exactly where we would end up.

613
01:16:13,403 --> 01:16:14,988
We could try
to force our way south.

614
01:16:15,155 --> 01:16:18,200
Ought to hit Samoa in 30 days.

615
01:16:18,367 --> 01:16:21,245
Good, thanks.

616
01:16:21,411 --> 01:16:23,247
What other options are there?

617
01:16:31,255 --> 01:16:36,218
We could try and, uh... surf over it.

618
01:16:36,927 --> 01:16:38,428
Surf?

619
01:16:39,429 --> 01:16:40,806
Yes.

620
01:16:40,973 --> 01:16:43,767
You see, waves build in cycles of 13.

621
01:16:43,934 --> 01:16:47,980
Meaning every 13th wave is
significantly bigger than the rest.

622
01:16:48,146 --> 01:16:50,816
Um... let me show you.

623
01:16:50,983 --> 01:16:55,570
Uh... when we get close to the reef,

624
01:16:55,737 --> 01:16:58,532
we'll throw out an anchor
or something heavy

625
01:16:58,699 --> 01:17:03,161
to hold the raft
back in position.

626
01:17:03,328 --> 01:17:06,707
- Then what?
- Then we count the waves.

627
01:17:06,873 --> 01:17:10,961
And just before the 13th wave,
we cut the rope,

628
01:17:11,128 --> 01:17:15,257
and hopefully surf the raft
over the reef.

629
01:17:15,424 --> 01:17:17,259
That might work.

630
01:17:23,890 --> 01:17:25,767
I like it.

631
01:17:29,187 --> 01:17:30,188
That's the way.

632
01:17:32,316 --> 01:17:34,443
- Let's do it.
- All right.

633
01:17:34,609 --> 01:17:36,028
Let's find something heavy.

634
01:17:47,664 --> 01:17:50,584
Approaching Raroia reef.

635
01:17:50,751 --> 01:17:53,795
If no word within 36 hours,

636
01:17:53,962 --> 01:17:57,424
contact Norwegian Embassy
in Washington.

637
01:17:57,591 --> 01:18:00,344
Two hundred and 50 yards to go.

638
01:18:02,346 --> 01:18:03,347
Ow!

639
01:18:09,144 --> 01:18:11,897
- Put your boots on!
- Everybody, get your boots on!

640
01:18:45,013 --> 01:18:47,391
Are we ready?
Is everything set?

641
01:18:47,557 --> 01:18:51,937
- When you're ready, Herman.
- Yep! All right! Drop the anchor!

642
01:19:10,831 --> 01:19:12,582
One!

643
01:19:15,127 --> 01:19:16,962
Did you ever consider
life jackets?

644
01:19:17,129 --> 01:19:18,880
Two!

645
01:19:22,134 --> 01:19:24,094
Three!

646
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:29,558
Four!

647
01:19:34,312 --> 01:19:36,565
Five!

648
01:19:40,652 --> 01:19:42,362
Six!

649
01:19:45,574 --> 01:19:46,575
Seven!

650
01:19:50,454 --> 01:19:51,830
Eight!

651
01:19:54,416 --> 01:19:55,876
Nine!

652
01:20:01,673 --> 01:20:04,759
We've lost it!
Pull tight!

653
01:21:41,273 --> 01:21:42,816
Thor!

654
01:21:42,983 --> 01:21:45,652
Thor! Wait!

655
01:25:56,069 --> 01:25:59,489
This is BBC Radio
reporting worldwide.

656
01:25:59,656 --> 01:26:01,282
This is Radio Australia World News...

657
01:26:01,449 --> 01:26:03,201
A stunning achievement
being reported today

658
01:26:03,368 --> 01:26:05,161
from the Tuamotu Islands
in Polynesia.

659
01:26:05,328 --> 01:26:08,706
... six Scandinavian
explorers, 5,000 miles of sea

660
01:26:08,873 --> 01:26:11,084
and one balsa wood raft.

661
01:26:11,251 --> 01:26:14,921
...cheating death
over a 101-day voyage.

662
01:26:15,088 --> 01:26:17,173
Not since Ernest
Shackleton- s journey to Antarctica

663
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:19,592
- has anyone done something so bold.
- An awe-inspiring tale of man

664
01:26:19,759 --> 01:26:22,846
against nature.
