2
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,072
Do you find me sadistic?

3
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:37,486
You know, I bet I could fry
an egg on your head right now.

4
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,794
If I wanted to.

5
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,292
You know, kiddo...

6
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:51,703
I'd like to believe
you're aware enough, even now,

7
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:58,081
to know that there's nothing
sadistic in my actions.

8
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,918
We, maybe towards
those other jokers.

9
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,458
But not you.

10
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:12,190
No, kiddo.

11
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,199
At this moment...

12
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:22,932
This is me at my most
masochistic.

13
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:27,002
Bill, it's your baby.

14
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,842
Coming!

15
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,538
Sarah, I cannot believe
you are early.

16
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:52,433
What you gonna do now, huh?
What you got?

17
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:55,310
Got your ass!
Remember that? Huh? Remember?

18
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,050
Okay.
Come on, bitch.

19
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:11,192
Come on.
Bring it on.

20
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,998
Mommy, I'm home.

21
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,595
Hey, baby.

22
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,573
How was school?

23
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,604
Mommy, what happened to you
and the TV room?

24
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,614
Oh.

25
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,173
That good-for-nothing dog
of yours got his ass

26
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,617
in the living room
and acted a damn fool.

27
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,383
- That's what happened, baby.
- Barney did this?

28
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,617
Baby, now, you can't
come in here.

29
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:17,061
There's broken glass everywhere,
and you could cut yourself.

30
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:26,134
This is an old friend of mommy's
I ain't seen in a long time.

31
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,173
Hi, honey.

32
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,970
I'm ****

33
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:31,202
What's your name?

34
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,975
Her name is Nikki.

35
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,641
Nikki.

36
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:42,352
Such a pretty name
for such a pretty girl.

37
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:45,817
How old are you, Nikki?

38
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:53,164
Nikki, **** asked you
a question.

39
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,291
I'm 4.

40
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,563
4 years old, eh?

41
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:02,640
You know,
I had a little girl once.

42
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,936
She'd be about 4 now.

43
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,749
Now, baby, me and mommy's friend
got some grown-up talk

44
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:14,115
to talk about.

45
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:15,278
You can go in your room.

46
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:18,289
And I want you to leave us alone
till I tell you to come out.

47
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:19,790
Okay?

48
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,295
Nikkia!

49
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:26,160
In your room.
Now.

50
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,975
You want some coffee?

51
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,208
Yeah. Sure.

52
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,985
<i>This Pasadena homemaker's name</i>

53
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,150
<i>Is Jeanne Bell.</i>

54
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:55,819
<i>Her husband is
Dr. Lawrence Bell.</i>

55
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,659
<i>But back when we were
acquainted, Four years ago,</i>

56
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,824
<i>her nanne was Vernita Green.</i>

57
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,494
<i>Her code name was Copperhead.</i>

58
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,366
<i>Mine, Black Mamba.</i>

59
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,996
Do you have a towel?

60
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,831
Yeah.

61
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,307
Thanks.

62
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,439
You still take cream and sugar?

63
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:17,482
Yeah.

64
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:23,316
So suppose it's a little late
for an apology.

65
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,755
You suppose correctly.

66
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,020
Look, bitch, I need to know

67
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,858
if you're gonna start more shit
around my baby girl.

68
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,955
You can relax for now.

69
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:37,793
I'm not gonna murder you
in front of your child, okay?

70
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:40,465
That's being more rational

71
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,871
than Bill led me to believe
you were capable of.

72
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:47,311
It's mercy, compassion,
and forgiveness I lack.

73
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,348
Not rationality.

74
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,419
Look.

75
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,980
I know I fucked you over.
I fucked you over bad.

76
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,549
I wish to God I hadn't,
but I did.

77
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,586
You have every right
to want to get even.

78
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,155
No, no, no, no, no.

79
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,291
No.

80
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:12,167
To get even, even Stephen,

81
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:18,666
would have to kill you,
go up to Nikki's room, kill her,

82
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:23,511
then wait for your husband
to come home and kill him.

83
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,948
That would be even, Vernita.

84
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,145
That'd be about square.

85
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,280
Look, if I could go back
in a machine, I would.

86
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,018
But I can't.

87
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,229
All I can tell you is that I'm
a different person now.

88
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:41,255
Oh, great.
I don't care.

89
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,198
Be that as it may,

90
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,295
I know I don't deserve
your mercy or your forgiveness.

91
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:51,002
However, I beseech you for both
on behalf of my daughter.

92
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:54,843
Bitch, you can stop right there.

93
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:57,481
Just because I have no wish
to murder you

94
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,881
before the eyes of your daughter

95
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,511
does not mean that parading her
around in front of me

96
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:04,647
is gonna inspire sympathy.

97
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,693
You and I have
unfinished business.

98
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,921
And not a goddamn fucking thing
you've done

99
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,485
in the subsequent four years,

100
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:15,762
including getting knocked up,
is gonna change that.

101
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,261
So when do we do this?

102
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,499
It all depends.

103
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,168
When do you want to die?

104
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,110
Tomorrow?
The day after tomorrow?

105
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,441
How about tonight, bitch?

106
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,846
Splendid.
Where?

107
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,180
There's a baseball diamond
where I coach our little league

108
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,186
about a mile from here.

109
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,245
We meet there around 2:30
in the morning,

110
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:41,350
dressed all in black,
your hair in a back stocking.

111
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,260
And we have us a knife fight.

112
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,355
We won't be bothered.

113
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:51,335
Now, I have to fix
Nikki's cereal.

114
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,243
Bill said you were one
of the best ladies he saw

115
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:03,747
with an edged weapon.

116
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,977
Fuck you, bitch.

117
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,417
I know he didn't qualify
that shit.

118
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:12,287
So you can just kiss my
motherfucking ass, Black Mamba.

119
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,253
Black Mamba.

120
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:18,023
I should have been
motherfucking Black Mamba.

121
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,086
Weapon of choice?

122
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,895
If you want to stick with your
butcher knife, that's fine.

123
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:26,103
Very funny, bitch.

124
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,935
Very funny!

125
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:28,591
It was not my intention
to do this in front of you.

126
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,894
For that, I'm sorry.

127
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,470
But you can take my word for it.

128
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:42,036
Your mother had it coming.

129
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:03,225
When you grow up, if you still
feel raw about it...

130
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,802
I'll be waiting.

131
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,540
For those regarded as warriors...

132
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,279
When engaged in combat...

133
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:23,444
the vanquishing of thine enemy can be
the warrior's only concern.

134
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:31,021
Suppress a human emotion and compassion...

135
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:42,631
...kill whoever stands in thy way, even if that be
Lord God, or Buddha himself.

136
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:54,648
This truth lies at the heart of the art of combat.

137
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:21,709
Come on out to Dallas.

138
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,477
This is Rockabilly Rhythms
on KTRN, Wichita Falls.

139
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,815
And next, we got some record.

140
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:30,650
Very own wildman,
Charlie Feathers.

141
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:11,295
Well, give me the gory details,
Son Number One.

142
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,729
It's a goddamn massacre, Pop.

143
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,962
They wiped out the whole
wedding party, execution style.

144
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,573
Give me a figure.

145
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,632
Nine dead bodies.

146
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,304
And we're talking
the whole shebang.

147
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,314
Bride. Groom.

148
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,077
Reverend.

149
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,813
Reverend's wife.

150
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,914
They even shot that old colored
fella that plays the organ.

151
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,255
It would appear
somebody objected to this

152
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,658
and wasn't able to hold
their peace.

153
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:52,135
Good gravy, Marie.

154
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,105
What'd I tell you, Pop?

155
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:02,443
It's like a goddamn
Nicaraguan death squad.

156
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:05,278
You better shit-can
that blasphemy, boy.

157
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,874
You're in a house of worship.

158
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,385
Sorry, Pop.

159
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:13,186
Well, this is definitely
the work of professionals.

160
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:18,127
I'd guesstimate
Mexican Mafia hit squad.

161
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,791
Four, maybe five strong.

162
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,891
How can you tell?

163
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,960
Well, a sure and steady hand
did this.

164
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:29,805
This ain't no
squirrey amateur.

165
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,402
This is the work of a salty dog.

166
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,209
You can tell by the cleanliness
of the carnage.

167
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,580
Now, a kill-crazy rampage,
though it may be,

168
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:42,916
all the colors are kept
inside the lines.

169
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:46,924
If you was a moron,
you could almost admire it.

170
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,930
Who's the bride?

171
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,496
I don't know.

172
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:04,098
The name
on the marriage certificate

173
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:07,202
is Arlene Machiavelli.

174
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,110
That's a fake.

175
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,876
We've been calling her
"The Bride"

176
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:12,439
on account of the dress.

177
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:15,282
You can tell she was pregnant.

178
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:16,946
Man would have to be a mad dog

179
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:20,924
to shoot a goddamn good-looking
gal like that in the head.

180
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:24,518
Look at her.

181
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:31,802
Hay-colored hair.
Big eyes.

182
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,600
She's a little
blood-splattered angel.

183
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,971
Son Number One?

184
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,307
Yeah?

185
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:45,908
This tall drink of cocksucker
ain't dead.

186
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:23,639
I might never have liked you.

187
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:27,836
Point in fact, I despise you.

188
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:33,445
But that shouldn't suggest
that I don't respect you.

189
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:39,682
Dying in our sleep is a luxury

190
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:43,023
that our kind
is rarely afforded.

191
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:46,826
My gift to you.

192
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,872
For fuck's sake.

193
00:22:58,443 --> 00:22:59,637
Hello, Bill.

194
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,343
What's her condition?

195
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:05,610
Comatose.

196
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,909
Where is she?

197
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:11,251
I'm standing over her right now.

198
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,416
That's my girl.

199
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,894
Elle, you're going to abort
the mission.

200
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,090
What?

201
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:21,689
We owe her better than that.

202
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,530
Oh, you don't owe her shit!

203
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,263
Will you keep your voice down?

204
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,202
You don't owe her shit!

205
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:29,365
May I say one thing?

206
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:31,272
Speak.

207
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,374
Y'all beat the hell
out of that woman.

208
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,380
But you didn't kill her.

209
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,279
And I put a bullet in her head.

210
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,683
But her heart
just kept on beating.

211
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,186
Now, you saw that yourself

212
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:48,158
with your own beautiful
blue eye, did you not?

213
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,655
We've done a lot of things
to this lady.

214
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:58,192
And if she ever wakes up,
we'll do a whole lot more.

215
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,204
But one thing we won't do

216
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:04,641
is sneak into her room
in the night like a filthy rat

217
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:08,645
and kill her in her sleep.

218
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:11,341
And the reason
we won't do that thing

219
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:16,649
is because that thing
would lower us.

220
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:18,746
Don't you agree, Miss Driver?

221
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:22,022
I guess.

222
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,584
Do you really have to guess?

223
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,654
No.

224
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:30,667
I don't really have to guess.
I know.

225
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:34,201
Come on home, honey.

226
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,565
Affirmative.

227
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:41,005
I love you very much.

228
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,240
I love you, too.

229
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,575
Bye-bye.

230
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,389
Thought that was pretty
fucking funny, didn't you?

231
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:02,956
Hmm?

232
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:07,630
Word of advice, shithead.

233
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,732
Don't you ever wake up.

234
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:52,313
At this moment, this is me
at my most masochistic.

235
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,478
Bill, it's your baby.

236
00:26:57,515 --> 00:27:00,814
Oh, my baby.

237
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:30,438
Four years.

238
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,605
The price is $75 a fuck,
my friend.

239
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,205
You getting your freak on
or what?

240
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:06,409
Oh, yeah, boy.

241
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,749
20, 40, 60, 75.

242
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,792
Yeah.
Now, here's the rules.

243
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,486
Rule number one.

244
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:17,619
No punching her.

245
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,459
Nurse comes in
and she got a shiner

246
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,294
or less some teeth, jig's up.

247
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,857
So no knuckle sandwiches
under no circumstances.

248
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:25,698
And by the way,
this cunt's a spitter.

249
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,297
It's a motor-reflex thing.
But spit or no, no punching.

250
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,343
- Now, are we clear on rule one?
- Yeah.

251
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,641
Good. Now, rule number two.
No monkey bites, no hickeys.

252
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,410
In fact, no leaving no marks
of no kind.

253
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:41,680
After that,
it's all good, buddy.

254
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,847
Now, her plumbing down there
don't work.

255
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:45,412
So feel free to come in her
all you want.

256
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,082
Keep the noise down.
Try not to make a mess.

257
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:48,750
I'll Be back in 20.

258
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:51,655
Yeah.

259
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,664
Oh, shit.

260
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,292
By the way, not all the time,
but sometimes

261
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:58,858
this chick's cooch can get
drier than a bucket of sand.

262
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:02,338
If she dry, lube up with this
and you'll be good to go.

263
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:05,468
<i>Bon appetit, good buddy.</i>

264
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:17,955
Oh, yeah.

265
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:20,389
Oh, God damn.

266
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:24,019
You are the best-looking girl
I've had today.

267
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,047
Oh.

268
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:14,577
Yo, stud!
Time's up, buddy.

269
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,409
Coming in, ready or not.

270
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,143
Hey, buddy, did you have
yourself a good time?

271
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:21,975
Whoa.

272
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,965
Aaaah!

273
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,241
Where's Bill?

274
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,945
Where's Bill?

275
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:58,416
Please stop hitting me.

276
00:30:58,489 --> 00:30:59,615
Where's Bill?

277
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:02,782
I don't know who Bill is!

278
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,328
Bullshit!

279
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:15,934
Well, ain't you the slice
of cutie pie they said you was?

280
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:19,340
Jane Doe, huh? We don't know
shit about you, do we?

281
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,139
I'm from Huntsville, Texas.

282
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:25,512
My name is Buck,
and I'm here to fuck.

283
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:31,282
Your name is Buck.

284
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:33,187
Right?

285
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:36,352
And you came here to fuck.

286
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:37,587
Right?

287
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,254
Wait a minute.
Wait.

288
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:07,147
"Pussy Wagon. "

289
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:09,159
You fucker.

290
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:39,313
Texas. Okay.

291
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,691
Wiggle your big toe.

292
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:34,301
Wiggle your big toe.

293
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:44,837
Wiggle your big toe.

294
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,616
Wiggle your big toe.

295
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,123
Wiggle your big toe.

296
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:01,597
<i>As I lay in the back
of Buck's truck,</i>

297
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,191
<i>trying to will my limbs
out of entropy...</i>

298
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,895
Wiggle your big toe.

299
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:10,031
<i>...I could see the faces of
the cunts who did this to me.</i>

300
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,009
<i>And the dicks responsible.</i>

301
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:20,114
<i>Members all of the Deadly Viper
Assassination Squad.</i>

302
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:23,714
<i>When fortune smiles
on something</i>

303
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,256
<i>as violent and ugly as revenge,</i>

304
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:30,317
<i>It seems proof like no other
that not only does God exist,</i>

305
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:32,419
<i>you're doing his will.</i>

306
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:35,091
<i>At a time when I knew the least
about my enemies,</i>

307
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,157
<i>the first name
on my death list,</i>

308
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:41,171
<i>O- Ren Ishii,
was the easiest to find.</i>

309
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,673
<i>But when one
manages the difficult task</i>

310
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:46,437
<i>of becoming queen
of the Tokyo underworld,</i>

311
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:49,742
<i>one doesn't keep it a secret,
does one?</i>

312
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:06,455
<i>O- Ren Ishii was born
on an American military base</i>

313
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,897
<i>In Tokyo, Japan.</i>

314
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:12,424
<i>The half-Japanese, half-Chinese
American Army brat</i>

315
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:16,064
<i>made her first acquaintance
with death at the age of 9.</i>

316
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,971
<i>It was at that age
she witnessed</i>

317
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,839
<i>the death of her parents
at the hands</i>

318
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:25,747
<i>of Japan's most ruthless
yakuza boss, Boss Matsumoto.</i>

319
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:54,110
Hyah!

320
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:34,009
Hmm.

321
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:44,419
Hmm.

322
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,215
Oh.

323
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:42,138
Mommy.

324
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,250
<i>She swore revenge.</i>

325
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:59,483
<i>Luckily for her,
Boss Matsumoto was a pedophile.</i>

326
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:05,522
<i>At 11, she got her revenge.</i>

327
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:12,198
Look at me, Matsumoto...

328
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:16,965
...take a good look at my face.

329
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:20,934
Look at my eyes.

330
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:26,143
Look at my mouth.

331
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:29,152
Do I look familiar?

332
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:33,548
Do I look like somebody...

333
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:35,785
you murdered?!

334
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:53,536
<i>By 20, she was one of the top
female assassins in the world.</i>

335
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:43,713
<i>At 25, she did her part
in the killing</i>

336
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:48,952
<i>of nine innocent people,
Including my unborn daughter,</i>

337
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:53,360
<i>In a small wedding chapel
In El Paso, Texas.</i>

338
00:43:53,430 --> 00:44:01,132
<i>But on that day four years ago
she made one big mistake.</i>

339
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:03,730
<i>She should have killed 10.</i>

340
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:08,811
<i>However, before satisfaction
would be mine,</i>

341
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:10,904
<i>first things first.</i>

342
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,916
Wiggle your big toe.

343
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,258
Hard part's over.

344
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:27,093
Now, let's get
these other piggies wiggling.

345
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:03,725
Welcome to Air O.
May I help you?

346
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:06,099
Okinawa.
One-way.

347
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,595
Hi.

348
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:36,565
Welcome...

349
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:43,171
Welcome.

350
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:45,975
You English?

351
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:48,341
Almost.
American.

352
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:52,178
American.
Welcome, American.

353
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,546
<i>Domo.</i>

354
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:56,450
My English very good.

355
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,785
<i>You said "domo."
Can you speak Japanese?</i>

356
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:00,789
No, no.

357
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:03,793
Just a few words learned
since yesterday.

358
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:06,421
Um, may I sit at the bar?

359
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:09,864
Oh, sure, sure, sure.
Please sit.

360
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:12,896
Oh.

361
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,803
What other words did you learn?

362
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:17,966
Oh, just a minute.

363
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:22,341
We have a customer.
Bring out some tea, quickly.

364
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,582
I'm watching my soap operas.

365
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:28,708
Lazy bastard...

366
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:31,145
Screw your soap opera... hurry up!

367
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:32,916
The tea's hot.

368
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,719
Why don't you serve it yourself for once?

369
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,157
Shut up!

370
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:39,161
Get your ass out here!

371
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:41,197
Uh, excuse me.

372
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:46,668
Uh, what other Japanese
do you know?

373
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:47,669
Oh, let's see.

374
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:49,865
<i>Um, "arigato."</i>

375
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,408
<i>"Arigato."
Good!</i>

376
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:56,606
<i>Um, already said "donno,"
right?</i>

377
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,114
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

378
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:00,241
"Konn-itch-iwa."

379
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,046
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

380
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:03,882
"Kohn-nee-chee-wah."

381
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:05,615
<i>Konnichi wa.
Pease repeat.</i>

382
00:47:05,689 --> 00:47:06,849
<i>Konnichi wa.</i>

383
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:07,948
Perfect.

384
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:10,050
Good, good, good.

385
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:12,652
You say Japanese word
like you Japanese.

386
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:14,219
Oh, you're making fun of me!

387
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:17,290
No, no, no, no.
Serious business.

388
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:20,495
Pronounciation very good.

389
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:25,167
<i>You say arigato
like we say arigato.</i>

390
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:31,405
<i>Well, thank you.
I mean, arigato.</i>

391
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:32,880
Mmm-hmm.

392
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:35,475
You should learn Japanese.

393
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:37,486
Very easy.

394
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:39,522
No kidding.
I heard it was kind of hard.

395
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,751
Most difficult.

396
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:44,726
But you have Japanese tongue.

397
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:48,622
Okay, okay.

398
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:55,569
Oh.
Oh, my God.

399
00:47:55,639 --> 00:48:01,475
Hey, what the hell happened to the tea?
Hurry up... goddammit!

400
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:09,514
Lazy oaf...

401
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,116
What d'ya want?

402
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:18,118
Beg your pardon?

403
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:21,460
Uh, drink.

404
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:22,793
Oh, yes.

405
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:25,300
A bottle of warm sake, please.

406
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:26,961
Warm sake?

407
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:29,130
Very good!

408
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:30,673
One warm sake!

409
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,904
Sake? In the middle of the day?

410
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:38,678
- Day, night, afternoon -
Who gives a damn- Get the sake!

411
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,650
How come I always have to get the sake?

412
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:42,810
You listen we...

413
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,619
For thirty years, you make the fish,
I get the sake.

414
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:48,487
If this were the military,

415
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:52,289
I'd be General by now.

416
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:55,126
Oh, so you'd be General, huh?

417
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:59,100
If you were General, I'd be emperor,

418
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:01,603
and you'd still get the sake -

419
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:03,867
and you'd still get the sake -
So shut up and get the sake.

420
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:04,999
Do you understand?

421
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:07,009
I'm not bad, okay? I shaved my head.

422
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:09,045
Do you understand me?

423
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:13,976
Sorry.

424
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:19,220
Oh! Oh, oh.
First time in Japan?

425
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,722
- Uh-huh.
- Oh.

426
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,988
What brings you to Okinawa?

427
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:25,858
Came to see a man.

428
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:28,625
Oh, yeah.

429
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:31,463
You have a friend
live in Okinawa?

430
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:33,127
Not quite.

431
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:35,068
Not friend?

432
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,537
Never met him.

433
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:38,574
Never?

434
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,405
Who is he?

435
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,172
May I ask?

436
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:46,077
Hattori Hanzo.

437
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,759
What do you want with Hattori Hanzo?

438
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:04,795
I need Japanese steel.

439
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,972
Why do you need Japanese steel?

440
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:14,468
I have vermin to kill.

441
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:23,616
You must have big rats,
you need Hattori Hanzo's steel.

442
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:28,080
Huge.

443
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,872
May I?

444
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,677
You may.

445
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:04,042
Wait.

446
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,646
Try the second one down.

447
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:01,634
Funny.

448
00:53:01,711 --> 00:53:04,077
You like samurai swords.

449
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:09,579
I like baseball.

450
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:20,052
I wanted to show you these.

451
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:22,126
However...

452
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,565
...someone as you, who knows so much, must
surely know...

453
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:32,105
...I no longer make instruments of death.

454
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:35,034
What I have here...

455
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:41,607
...I keep for their aesthetic and sentimental value.

456
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:46,784
Yet proud as I am of my life's work...

457
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:55,160
...I have retired.

458
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:05,299
Then give me one of these.

459
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:07,707
These are not for sale.

460
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:11,579
I didn't say "sell me."

461
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:13,275
I said "give me."

462
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:18,646
Why should I help you?

463
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:23,921
Because my vermin
is a former student of yours.

464
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:29,665
And considering the student,

465
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:34,830
I'd say you have
a rather large obligation.

466
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,023
You can sleep here.

467
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,192
It will take me a month...

468
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:40,267
...to make the sword.

469
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:44,401
I suggest you spend it practicing.

470
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:14,763
I've completed doing...

471
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:20,429
...what I swore an oath to God, 28 years ago,

472
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:26,435
...to never do again.

473
00:57:29,145 --> 00:57:33,047
I have created "something that kills people."

474
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:40,518
And in that purpose, was a success.

475
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,685
I've done this because philosophically,

476
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:52,457
I am sympathetic to your aim.

477
00:57:55,205 --> 00:58:01,144
I can tell you with no ego, this is my finest sword.

478
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,770
If on your journey, you should encounter God...

479
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:09,012
...God will be cut.

480
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:23,828
Yellow-haired warrior...

481
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,295
Go.

482
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:27,927
<i>Domo.</i>

483
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:53,258
<i>It was one year after
the massacre in El Paso, Texas,</i>

484
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:55,297
<i>that Bill backed
his Nippon progeny</i>

485

490
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:11,040
<i>It was O-Ren Ishii
and her powerful posse...</i>

491
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:16,048
<i>...the Crazy 88,
that proved the victor.</i>

492
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:20,121
<i>The pretty lady
to O-Ren's right,</i>

493
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:22,885
<i>who's dressed like
she's a villain on "Star Trek,"</i>

494
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:26,895
<i>is O-Ren's lawyer, best friend,
and second lieutenant.</i>

495
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:31,127
<i>The half-French,
half-Japanese Sofie Fatale.</i>

496
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,431
<i>Another former protégée
of Bill's.</i>

497
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:39,068
<i>The young girl
in the school-girl uniform</i>

498
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:44,637
<i>is O-Ren's personal bodyguard,
17-year-old Gogo Yubari.</i>

499
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:47,945
<i>Gogo may be young,
but what she lacks in age,</i>

500
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:50,747
<i>she makes up for in madness.</i>

501
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,515
Do you like Ferraris?

502
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,584
Ferrari... italian trash.

503
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:09,633
Do you want to screw me?

504
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:14,866
Don't laugh! Do you want to screw me, yes or no?

505
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:17,279
Yes.

506
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:22,713
How 'bout now, big boy?

507
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:26,512
Do you still wish to penetrate me...

508
01:00:28,992 --> 01:00:30,024
...or is it I...

509
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:32,357
...or is it I... who has penetrated you?

510
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:35,488
<i>See what I mean?</i>

511
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:41,461
<i>The bald guy in the black suit
and the Kato mask is Johnny Mo,</i>

512
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:45,997
<i>the head general of O-Ren's
personal army, the Crazy 88.</i>

513
01:00:47,877 --> 01:00:50,107
<i>And just in case
you were wondering</i>

514
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:54,138
<i>how could a half-breed
Japanese-Chinese American</i>

515
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:59,052
<i>become the boss of all bosses
in Tokyo, Japan,</i>

516
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:00,646
<i>I'll tell you.</i>

517
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:03,487
<i>The subject of O-Ren's blood
and nationality</i>

518
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:06,255
<i>came up before the council
only once.</i>

519
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:11,426
<i>The night O-Ren assumed power
over the crime council.</i>

520
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,594
<i>The man who seems bound
and determined</i>

521
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,503
<i>to break the mood
is Boss Tanaka.</i>

522
01:01:16,572 --> 01:01:20,008
<i>And what Boss Tanaka
thinks is...</i>

523
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:24,902
Boss Tanaka!

524
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:26,709
What's the meaning of this outburst?

525
01:01:26,783 --> 01:01:28,614
This is a time for celebration!

526
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:31,983
And what exactly are we celebrating?

527
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,889
The perversion of our illustrious council?

528
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:40,886
Tanaka, have you gone mad?

529
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:42,225
I will not tolerate this!

530
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:44,459
You're disrespecting our sister! Apologize!

531
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:50,902
Tanaka-San, of what perversion do you speak?

532
01:01:56,813 --> 01:01:58,212
My father...

533
01:01:58,915 --> 01:01:59,973
...along with yours,

534
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:01,539
and along with yours,
started this council.

535
01:02:02,752 --> 01:02:04,185
And while...

536
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:05,743
...you laugh like stupid donkeys...

537
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:07,483
...they weep in the afterlife...

538
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:09,056
- Shut up!

539
01:02:09,992 --> 01:02:11,823
...over the perversion committed today!

540
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:15,120
Outrageous!

541
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:17,993
Tanaka, it is you who insults this council!

542
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:19,056
Bastard!

543
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:21,297
Fuck face!

544
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,467
Gentlemen.

545
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:31,105
Tanaka obviously has something on his mind.

546
01:02:32,648 --> 01:02:36,675
By all means, allow him to express it.

547
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:42,316
Speak, of the perversion done to this
council,

548
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:45,291
...which I love...

549
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:47,596
...more than my own children,

550
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:53,465
...by making a Chinese Jap-American
half breed bitch its leader!

551
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,877
Aah! Aah!

552
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:20,558
So that you understand how serious I am...

553
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,825
...I'm going to say this in English.

554
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:23,864
Huh!

555
01:03:36,712 --> 01:03:39,044
As your leader...

556
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:40,605
I encourage you
from time to time,

557
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:45,347
and always in a respectful
manner, to question my logic.

558
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:46,353
If you're unconvinced

559
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:48,856
a particular plan of action
I've decided is the wisest,

560
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:50,119
tell me so.

561
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:51,751
But allow me to convince you.

562
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,955
And promise you,
right here and now,

563
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:57,591
no subject will ever be taboo.

564
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:00,932
Except, of course, the subject
that was just under discussion.

565
01:04:03,105 --> 01:04:05,130
The price you pay

566
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:08,109
for bringing up either
my Chinese or American heritage

567
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:12,136
as a negative is,
I collect your fucking head.

568
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:14,615
Just like this fucker here.

569
01:04:16,986 --> 01:04:19,580
Now, if any of you
sons of bitches

570
01:04:19,655 --> 01:04:24,388
got anything else to say,
now is the fucking time!

571
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:28,053
Didn't think so.

572
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,267
Gentlemen, this meeting is adjourned.

573
01:04:34,337 --> 01:04:36,828
One ticket to Tokyo please.

574
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:12,822
<i>Moshi moshi.</i>

575
01:08:48,557 --> 01:08:49,922
Hey!

576
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:53,593
- Hey, yeah!
- Hey, yeah!

577
01:09:32,801 --> 01:09:34,928
Gogo.

578
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:05,656
Yeah! Whoo!

579
01:11:49,038 --> 01:11:52,064
You have to say "Yes, yes, yes" to
any selfish demands they make.

580
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:53,836
They demand ridiculous things.

581
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:56,173
Shut up... Do you know what would
happen if they heard you?

582
01:11:56,245 --> 01:11:57,075
What's gonna happen?

583
01:11:57,212 --> 01:11:58,611
Did you hear about the Tanaka clan?

584
01:11:58,781 --> 01:12:00,544
You're gonna get your head chopped off.

585
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:01,479
No, I don't want that.

586
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:50,757
Yes, it's me.

587
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:58,336
And if you give us a contact number,
we will get back to you.

588
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:16,481
Who do you remind me of?

589
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:19,217
Charlie Brown!

590
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:23,198
You're right, he does look like
Charlie Brown.

591
01:13:23,233 --> 01:13:24,187
Charlie Brown.

592
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:25,956
Four pepperoni pizzas.

593
01:13:26,301 --> 01:13:27,529
That's not on our menu...

594
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:29,931
I don't care, bring them, goddammit!

595
01:13:31,206 --> 01:13:33,800
Hey... hey... Charlie, give me a kiss.

596
01:13:35,477 --> 01:13:37,308
O- Ren Ishii!

597
01:13:38,547 --> 01:13:42,039
You and I have unfinished business!

598
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:13,631
Charlie Brown, beat it.

599
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:22,177
Miki.

600
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:42,469
TEAR THE BITCH APART!

601
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:18,490
So, O-Ren, anymore subordinates
for me to kill?

602
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:21,434
Hi!

603
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:24,037
Gogo, right?

604
01:17:25,841 --> 01:17:27,536
Bingo.

605
01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:29,440
And you're Black Mamba.

606
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:34,540
Our reputations precede us.

607
01:17:35,884 --> 01:17:37,215
Don't they?

608
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:44,254
Gogo, I know you feel you must
protect your mistress.

609
01:17:45,394 --> 01:17:47,988
But I beg you.

610
01:17:48,063 --> 01:17:49,690
Walk away.

611
01:17:56,772 --> 01:17:58,433
You call that begging?

612
01:18:04,813 --> 01:18:07,304
You can beg better than that.

613
01:20:07,068 --> 01:20:08,228
Aah!

614
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:14,833
Aah!

615
01:20:17,179 --> 01:20:17,907
Aah!

616
01:21:21,343 --> 01:21:22,970
Is that what I think it is?

617
01:21:23,044 --> 01:21:25,774
You didn't think it was
gonna be that easy, did you?

618
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:33,183
You know, for a second there,
yeah, I kind of did.

619
01:21:34,189 --> 01:21:35,918
Silly rabbit.

620
01:21:36,591 --> 01:21:37,421
Trix are for...

621
01:21:37,492 --> 01:21:38,584
Kids.

622
01:21:42,597 --> 01:21:44,087
Hyaaaaaaah!

623
01:22:53,835 --> 01:22:54,893
Hyah!

624
01:23:08,116 --> 01:23:10,346
Aaaaaaaaahh!

625
01:23:28,536 --> 01:23:29,628
Aaahh!

626
01:24:36,704 --> 01:24:38,171
Aaaaahhh!

627
01:25:52,747 --> 01:25:53,679
Aaah!

628
01:28:07,382 --> 01:28:12,081
This is what you get
for fucking around with yakuzas!

629
01:28:12,153 --> 01:28:13,916
Go home to your mother!

630
01:29:13,014 --> 01:29:15,778
Those of you lucky enough to still
have your lives...

631
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:18,114
...take them with you!

632
01:29:20,221 --> 01:29:21,449
However...

633
01:29:22,824 --> 01:29:26,783
...leave the limbs you've lost.

634
01:29:27,995 --> 01:29:31,362
They belong to me now.

635
01:29:35,803 --> 01:29:38,670
Except you, Sofie!

636
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:42,673
You stay right where you are.

637
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:38,521
Your instrument
is quite impressive.

638
01:30:43,237 --> 01:30:44,864
Where was it made?

639
01:30:46,641 --> 01:30:48,268
Okinawa.

640
01:30:50,144 --> 01:30:53,045
Whom in Okinawa made you this steel?

641
01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:56,216
This is Hattori Hanzo steel.

642
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:57,581
YOU LIE!

643
01:31:05,893 --> 01:31:07,417
Mmm-hmm.

644
01:31:10,498 --> 01:31:12,796
Swords however, never get tired.

645
01:31:14,135 --> 01:31:17,593
Hope you've saved your energy.

646
01:31:21,275 --> 01:31:22,469
If you haven't...

647
01:31:24,612 --> 01:31:26,603
...you might not last five minutes.

648
01:31:28,649 --> 01:31:30,844
But as last looks go,

649
01:31:32,119 --> 01:31:34,679
you could do worse.

650
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:17,175
Silly Caucasian girl likes
to play with samurai swords.

651
01:34:19,553 --> 01:34:22,454
You may not be able to fight
like a samurai.

652
01:34:25,493 --> 01:34:28,621
But you can at least die
like a samurai.

653
01:34:59,026 --> 01:35:00,493
Attack me...

654
01:35:01,796 --> 01:35:03,354
...with everything you have.

655
01:35:58,619 --> 01:36:01,417
For ridiculing you earlier...

656
01:36:03,958 --> 01:36:05,892
...I apologize.

657
01:36:14,468 --> 01:36:15,628
Accepted.

658
01:36:32,253 --> 01:36:33,151
Ready?

659
01:36:38,259 --> 01:36:39,419
Come on.

660
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:21,534
That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword.

661
01:39:27,695 --> 01:39:29,162
Sofie.

662
01:39:29,863 --> 01:39:31,728
Sofie.

663
01:39:31,799 --> 01:39:33,630
My Sofie.

664
01:39:33,701 --> 01:39:35,862
I'm so sorry.

665
01:39:39,206 --> 01:39:42,733
Please.
Please forgive my betrayal.

666
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:44,744
No more of that.

667
01:39:44,812 --> 01:39:46,575
But still...

668
01:39:46,647 --> 01:39:49,275
But still nothing.

669
01:39:50,818 --> 01:39:54,083
Except my aching heart
over what she's done

670
01:39:54,154 --> 01:39:57,555
to my beautiful
and brilliant Sofie.

671
01:39:58,325 --> 01:40:01,158
I've kept you alive
for two reasons.

672
01:40:01,228 --> 01:40:04,296
The first reason is information.

673
01:40:04,331 --> 01:40:07,166
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!

674
01:40:07,201 --> 01:40:08,964
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!
I'll tell you nothing.

675
01:40:10,237 --> 01:40:14,503
But I am gonna ask you
questions.

676
01:40:14,575 --> 01:40:18,671
And every time
you don't give me answers,

677
01:40:18,746 --> 01:40:21,340
I'm gonna cut something off.

678
01:40:22,082 --> 01:40:27,952
And I promise you, they will be
things you will miss!

679
01:40:28,589 --> 01:40:30,386
Give me your other arm!

680
01:40:33,427 --> 01:40:38,126
I want all the information
on the Deadly Vipers.

681
01:40:38,198 --> 01:40:39,358
If you had to guess...

682
01:40:39,433 --> 01:40:40,365
What they've been doing.

683
01:40:40,434 --> 01:40:41,628
Why she left you alive...

684
01:40:41,702 --> 01:40:43,636
And where I can find them.

685
01:40:43,704 --> 01:40:45,604
What would be your guess?

686
01:40:47,608 --> 01:40:50,543
Guessing won't be necessary.

687
01:40:50,611 --> 01:40:52,476
She informed me.

688
01:40:54,715 --> 01:40:58,742
She said I could keep
my wicked life for two reasons.

689
01:40:59,553 --> 01:41:00,952
As I said before,

690
01:41:01,021 --> 01:41:05,651
I've allowed you to keep your
wicked life for two reasons.

691
01:41:05,726 --> 01:41:11,164
And the second reason is
so you can tell him, in person,

692
01:41:11,231 --> 01:41:14,997
everything that happened
here tonight.

693
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:18,334
I want him to witness
the extent of my mercy

694
01:41:18,405 --> 01:41:22,000
by witnessing
your deformed body.

695
01:41:22,076 --> 01:41:26,342
I want you to tell him all the
information you just told me.

696
01:41:26,413 --> 01:41:29,439
I want him to know what I know.

697
01:41:29,516 --> 01:41:33,247
I want him to know
I want him to know.

698
01:41:33,754 --> 01:41:36,188
And I want them all to know

699
01:41:36,256 --> 01:41:42,217
they'll all soon be
as dead as O-Ren.

700
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:10,914
Revenge is never a straight line.

701
01:42:14,194 --> 01:42:15,889
It's a forest.

702
01:42:17,197 --> 01:42:20,098
And like a forest it's easy to lose your way...

703
01:42:21,235 --> 01:42:24,261
...to get lost... to forget where you came in.

704
01:42:27,741 --> 01:42:32,041
That woman deserves her revenge.

705
01:42:36,917 --> 01:42:41,286
And we deserve to die.

706
01:42:44,691 --> 01:42:48,593
She must suffer
to her last breath.

707
01:43:01,375 --> 01:43:04,310
How did you find me?

708
01:43:04,378 --> 01:43:06,039
I'm the man.

709
01:43:10,217 --> 01:43:13,653
One more thing, Sofie.

710
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:17,816
Is she aware her daughter
is still alive?
