1
00:00:35,682 --> 00:00:39,118
Legend tells of a legendary warrior...

2
00:00:39,185 --> 00:00:42,348
...whose kung fu skills
were the stuff of legend.

3
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:48,052
He traveled the land
in search of worthy foes.

4
00:00:57,904 --> 00:01:03,604
I see you like to chew.
Maybe you should chew on my fist!

5
00:01:03,676 --> 00:01:07,203
The warrior said nothing,
for his mouth was full.

6
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,443
Then he swallowed. And then he spoke.

7
00:01:10,517 --> 00:01:12,815
Enough talk. Let's fight!

8
00:01:12,886 --> 00:01:14,319
Shashabooey!

9
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,121
He was so deadly in fact,

10
00:01:19,192 --> 00:01:22,889
that his enemies would go blind from
overexposure to pure awesomeness.

11
00:01:22,962 --> 00:01:25,157
- My eyes!
- He's too awesome!

12
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:27,995
- And attractive.
- How can we repay you?

13
00:01:28,835 --> 00:01:31,235
There is no charge for awesomeness.

14
00:01:31,304 --> 00:01:33,932
Or attractiveness.

15
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:35,269
Kablooey!

16
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:38,071
It mattered not how many foes he faced.

17
00:01:38,144 --> 00:01:41,011
They were no match for his bodacity!

18
00:01:53,526 --> 00:01:58,190
Never before had a panda
been so feared! And so loved.

19
00:01:59,065 --> 00:02:01,761
Even the most heroic heroes in China,

20
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:04,065
the Furious Five,

21
00:02:04,137 --> 00:02:07,072
bowed in respect
to this great master.

22
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,971
We should hang out.

23
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:10,168
Agreed.

24
00:02:13,012 --> 00:02:15,173
But hanging out would have to wait.

25
00:02:15,248 --> 00:02:19,685
Because when you're facing
the 10,000 demons of Demon Mountain,

26
00:02:19,752 --> 00:02:22,550
there's only one thing
that matters and that's...

27
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:24,381
Po! Get up!

28
00:02:24,457 --> 00:02:26,220
You'll be later for work!

29
00:02:26,292 --> 00:02:27,554
What?

30
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:36,331
Po! Get up!

31
00:02:51,684 --> 00:02:55,142
Po. What are you doing up there?

32
00:02:55,221 --> 00:02:56,483
Nothing.

33
00:03:00,026 --> 00:03:03,757
Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper! Tigress!

34
00:03:10,236 --> 00:03:13,501
Po! Let's go! You're late for work.

35
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:14,938
Coming!

36
00:03:25,351 --> 00:03:26,477
Sorry, Dad.

37
00:03:26,553 --> 00:03:29,386
Sorry doesn't make the noodles.

38
00:03:29,455 --> 00:03:31,821
What were you doing up there?
All that noise.

39
00:03:31,891 --> 00:03:34,382
Nothing. I just had a crazy dream.

40
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,688
About what?

41
00:03:35,762 --> 00:03:37,354
What were you dreaming about?

42
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,954
What was I?

43
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:41,790
I was dreaming about...

44
00:03:43,836 --> 00:03:44,825
...noodles.

45
00:03:45,305 --> 00:03:48,968
Noodles? You were really
dreaming about noodles?

46
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:51,602
Yeah. What else
would I be dreaming about?

47
00:03:51,678 --> 00:03:54,146
Careful! That soup is sharp.

48
00:03:54,214 --> 00:03:55,681
Oh, happy day!

49
00:03:55,748 --> 00:03:59,650
My son, finally having the noodle dream!

50
00:04:01,054 --> 00:04:05,047
You don't know how long I've been
waiting for this moment.

51
00:04:05,124 --> 00:04:06,989
This is a sign, Po.

52
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,857
A sign of what?

53
00:04:08,928 --> 00:04:13,558
You are almost ready to be entrusted
with the secret ingredient

54
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:15,897
of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

55
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:21,100
Then you will fulfill your destiny
and take over the restaurant!

56
00:04:21,174 --> 00:04:24,666
As I took it over from my father,
who took it over from his father...

57
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:27,406
...who won it from a friend in mahjong.

58
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,176
Dad, Dad, Dad, it was just a dream.

59
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,548
No, it was the dream.

60
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:36,180
We are noodle folk.
Broth runs through our veins.

61
00:04:36,256 --> 00:04:40,158
But, Dad, didn't you ever want
to do something else?

62
00:04:40,226 --> 00:04:42,091
Something besides noodles?

63
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:45,096
Actually, when I was young and crazy,

64
00:04:45,164 --> 00:04:49,225
I thought about running away
and learning how to make tofu.

65
00:04:49,302 --> 00:04:50,428
Why didn't you?

66
00:04:50,503 --> 00:04:52,266
Because it was a stupid dream.

67
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:56,475
Can you imagine me making tofu?

68
00:04:57,277 --> 00:04:58,972
Tofu.

69
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:02,446
No! We all have our place in this world.

70
00:05:02,515 --> 00:05:05,075
Mine is here, and yours is...

71
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,379
I know, is here.

72
00:05:06,452 --> 00:05:09,580
No, it's at tables 2, 5, 7, and 12

73
00:05:09,656 --> 00:05:11,715
Service with a smile.

74
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,320
Well done, students...
if you were trying to disappoint me.

75
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:48,554
Tigress, you need more ferocity!
Monkey, greater speed.

76
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:51,529
Crane, height. Viper, subtlety.
Mantis...

77
00:05:51,597 --> 00:05:53,428
- Master Shifu.
- What?!

78
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:55,933
It's Master Oogway. He wants to see you.

79
00:06:06,846 --> 00:06:10,282
Master Oogway, you summoned me?
Is something wrong?

80
00:06:16,622 --> 00:06:21,059
Why must something be wrong
for me to want to see my old friend?

81
00:06:21,127 --> 00:06:23,254
So, nothing's wrong?

82
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:25,957
Well, I didn't say that.

83
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:45,679
You were saying?

84
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:48,845
I have had a vision.

85
00:06:48,921 --> 00:06:51,651
Tai Lung will return.

86
00:06:56,596 --> 00:06:59,156
That is impossible! He is in prison.

87
00:06:59,232 --> 00:07:01,996
Nothing is impossible.

88
00:07:02,869 --> 00:07:03,858
Zeng!

89
00:07:03,936 --> 00:07:06,268
Fly to Chorh-Gom prison and tell them

90
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:09,672
to double the guards, double
their weapons, double everything!

91
00:07:09,742 --> 00:07:11,642
Tai Lung does not leave that prison!

92
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:13,178
Yes, Master Shifu!

93
00:07:15,014 --> 00:07:20,179
One often meets his destiny
on the road he takes to avoid it.

94
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:24,246
We must do something! We can't let him
march on the valley, take his revenge!

95
00:07:24,323 --> 00:07:25,312
He'll...

96
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:27,689
Your mind is like this water,
my friend.

97
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,196
When it is agitated,
it becomes difficult to see.

98
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:34,362
But if you allow it to settle...

99
00:07:34,767 --> 00:07:37,429
...the answer becomes clear.

100
00:07:40,773 --> 00:07:42,536
The Dragon Scroll.

101
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:44,967
It is time.

102
00:07:45,044 --> 00:07:49,777
But who? Who is worthy to be trusted
with the secret to limitless power?

103
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:54,582
To become the Dragon Warrior?

104
00:07:54,654 --> 00:07:56,121
I don't know.

105
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,883
Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.

106
00:08:00,793 --> 00:08:01,817
Watch it!

107
00:08:01,894 --> 00:08:03,384
Sorry. Suck it up!

108
00:08:04,831 --> 00:08:07,561
Sorry. A thousand pardons.

109
00:08:07,633 --> 00:08:08,622
What?

110
00:08:10,736 --> 00:08:14,001
Master Oogway's choosing
the Dragon Warrior! Today!

111
00:08:14,073 --> 00:08:18,669
Everyone! Get to the Jade Palace! One of
the Five is gonna get the Dragon Scroll!

112
00:08:18,744 --> 00:08:21,804
We've waited 1,000 years for this!
Take the bowl!

113
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:26,011
This is the greatest day
in kung fu history! Just go!

114
00:08:26,085 --> 00:08:28,076
Po! Where are you going?

115
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:31,320
To the Jade Palace.

116
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,688
You're forgetting your noodle cart.

117
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:38,321
The whole valley will be there,
and you'll sell noodles to all of them.

118
00:08:38,397 --> 00:08:39,796
Selling noodles?

119
00:08:42,502 --> 00:08:44,902
But, Dad, I was thinking, maybe I...

120
00:08:44,971 --> 00:08:47,098
- Yeah?
- I was thinking maybe I...

121
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:55,505
...could also sell the bean buns.
They're about to go bad.

122
00:08:55,581 --> 00:08:57,276
That's my boy!

123
00:08:57,383 --> 00:08:59,613
I told you that dream was a sign.

124
00:08:59,652 --> 00:09:02,621
Yeah. Glad I had it.

125
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:09,226
- I'm a kung fu warrior!
- Me, too!

126
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:11,820
- There's spots at the top.
- Let's go.

127
00:09:46,332 --> 00:09:49,096
Come on. Come on!

128
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:51,033
Almost there.

129
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,263
What?

130
00:09:52,338 --> 00:09:55,000
No! Oh, no!

131
00:09:57,343 --> 00:10:00,904
- Sorry, Po.
- We'll bring you back a souvenir.

132
00:10:05,351 --> 00:10:08,843
No. I'll bring me back a souvenir.

133
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,459
It is an historic day.

134
00:10:15,528 --> 00:10:17,291
Isn't it, Master Oogway?

135
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:22,232
Yes, and one I feared
I would not live to see.

136
00:10:22,301 --> 00:10:24,292
Are your students ready?

137
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,133
Yes, Master Oogway.

138
00:10:27,306 --> 00:10:29,035
Know this, old friend.

139
00:10:29,108 --> 00:10:33,442
Whomever I choose will not only bring
peace to the valley...

140
00:10:33,512 --> 00:10:36,140
...but also to you.

141
00:10:39,852 --> 00:10:39,952
Let the tournament begin!

142
00:10:39,952 --> 00:10:43,615
Let the tournament begin!

143
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:56,432
Yeah.

144
00:10:58,938 --> 00:11:00,166
No, no, wait!

145
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:02,571
I'm coming! Wait, wait!

146
00:11:02,642 --> 00:11:03,870
Yes!

147
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,245
Hey! Open the door!

148
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:14,244
Let me in!

149
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,880
Citizens of the Valley of Peace,

150
00:11:16,956 --> 00:11:20,653
it is my great honor
to present to you... Tigress!

151
00:11:20,726 --> 00:11:24,890
Viper! Crane! Monkey! Mantis!

152
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:26,295
The Furious Five!

153
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:40,545
Yeah, the Furious Five!

154
00:11:42,848 --> 00:11:44,179
Warriors, prepare!

155
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,810
Wait. No. Oh, peeky-hole.

156
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:48,217
- Ready for battle!
- Yeah.

157
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:52,280
The Thousand Tongues of Fire.

158
00:11:54,593 --> 00:11:55,719
Look at that.

159
00:11:55,795 --> 00:11:57,786
Hey! Get out of the way!

160
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,331
And finally Master Tigress!

161
00:12:35,768 --> 00:12:40,171
And believe me, citizens,
you have not seen anything yet.

162
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:41,501
I know!

163
00:12:41,574 --> 00:12:46,671
Master Tigress! Face Iron Ox
and his Blades of Death.

164
00:12:59,091 --> 00:13:03,528
I sense the Dragon Warrior is among us.

165
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:11,693
Citizens of the Valley of Peace,

166
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:16,299
Master Oogway will now choose
the Dragon Warrior!

167
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:19,437
Oh, no! No, no, wait!

168
00:13:20,713 --> 00:13:22,203
Yeah.

169
00:13:38,731 --> 00:13:39,755
Po!

170
00:13:39,832 --> 00:13:41,766
What are you doing?!

171
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:44,394
What does it look like I'm doing?! Stop!

172
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,404
I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior!

173
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:53,838
But I don't understand.
You finally had the noodle dream!

174
00:13:54,713 --> 00:13:57,739
I lied. I don't dream
about noodles, Dad.

175
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:04,080
I love kung fu!

176
00:14:16,235 --> 00:14:21,104
Come on, son. Let's get back to work.

177
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:25,108
OK.

178
00:14:31,183 --> 00:14:32,946
Come back!

179
00:14:57,176 --> 00:14:58,973
What's going on?

180
00:14:59,745 --> 00:15:01,406
Where?

181
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,474
What are you pointing?

182
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,211
OK. Sorry.

183
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:12,757
I just wanted to see
who the Dragon Warrior was.

184
00:15:12,825 --> 00:15:14,759
How interesting.

185
00:15:14,827 --> 00:15:18,126
Master, are you pointing at me?

186
00:15:18,197 --> 00:15:20,222
- Him.
- Who?

187
00:15:22,268 --> 00:15:24,429
- You.
- Me?

188
00:15:24,503 --> 00:15:29,998
The universe has brought us
the Dragon Warrior!

189
00:15:30,242 --> 00:15:31,675
- What?
- What?!

190
00:15:31,744 --> 00:15:33,439
- What?!
- What?!

191
00:15:43,322 --> 00:15:45,916
Stop, wait! Who told you to?

192
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,930
Master Oogway, wait.

193
00:15:57,036 --> 00:16:01,268
That flabby panda can't possibly be
the answer to our problem.

194
00:16:01,307 --> 00:16:05,038
You were about to point at Tigress
and that thing fell in front of her!

195
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,543
That was just an accident!

196
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:09,376
There are no accidents.

197
00:16:24,496 --> 00:16:27,260
Forgive us, Master. We have failed you.

198
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:30,666
No. If the panda
has not quit by morning

199
00:16:30,736 --> 00:16:33,068
then I will have failed you.

200
00:16:51,357 --> 00:16:54,087
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!
I bring a message...

201
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:56,423
...from Master Shifu.

202
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,258
What?!

203
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:03,665
"Double the guard?!"

204
00:17:03,736 --> 00:17:05,533
"Extra precautions?!"

205
00:17:05,604 --> 00:17:07,936
"Your prison may not be adequate?!"

206
00:17:11,043 --> 00:17:14,501
You doubt my prison security?!

207
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,445
Absolutely not.

208
00:17:16,515 --> 00:17:19,643
Shifu does. I'm just the messenger.

209
00:17:19,718 --> 00:17:23,347
I'll give you a message
for your Master Shifu.

210
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:27,117
Escape from Chorh-Gom prison
is impossible!

211
00:17:32,364 --> 00:17:34,298
Impressive, isn't it?

212
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:37,064
It's very impressive.

213
00:17:37,136 --> 00:17:38,626
It's very impressive.

214
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:41,366
One way in, one way out.

215
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,536
One thousand guards and one prisoner.

216
00:17:45,611 --> 00:17:48,136
Yes, except that prisoner...

217
00:17:48,213 --> 00:17:49,908
...is Tai Lung.

218
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:55,715
Take us down.

219
00:18:01,226 --> 00:18:02,591
What are you doing?

220
00:18:13,939 --> 00:18:15,406
Oh, my.

221
00:18:19,678 --> 00:18:22,738
Behold Tai Lung.

222
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:27,476
I'm just gonna wait right here.

223
00:18:27,553 --> 00:18:31,853
It's nothing to worry about.
It's perfectly safe.

224
00:18:31,924 --> 00:18:34,188
Crossbows! At the ready!

225
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:36,056
Crossbows?

226
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:38,688
Hey, tough guy, did you hear?

227
00:18:38,764 --> 00:18:43,258
Oogway's giving someone the Dragon
Scroll, and it's not gonna be you.

228
00:18:43,335 --> 00:18:44,996
Don't get him mad.

229
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:49,871
What's he gonna do about it?
I've got him completely immobilized.

230
00:18:54,113 --> 00:18:58,072
Did I step on the wittle kitty's tail?

231
00:18:58,183 --> 00:18:59,980
I'm good. I've seen enough.

232
00:19:00,018 --> 00:19:02,452
I'll tell Shifu he
has nothing to worry about.

233
00:19:02,521 --> 00:19:03,749
No, he doesn't.

234
00:19:03,822 --> 00:19:06,052
I'll tell him that.

235
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,990
Can we please go now?

236
00:19:23,575 --> 00:19:26,478
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

237
00:19:26,478 --> 00:19:27,001
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

238
00:19:32,718 --> 00:19:34,151
Wait a second!

239
00:19:39,158 --> 00:19:43,822
I think there's been a slight mistake.
Everyone seems to think that I'm...

240
00:19:46,765 --> 00:19:50,098
The Sacred Hall of Warriors! No way!

241
00:19:51,069 --> 00:19:52,502
Look at this place.

242
00:19:54,673 --> 00:19:59,110
Master Flying Rhino's armor,
with authentic battle damage!

243
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,041
The Sword of Heroes!

244
00:20:03,115 --> 00:20:06,380
Said to be so sharp you can cut yourself
just by looking.

245
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,116
The Invisible Trident of Destiny!

246
00:20:12,758 --> 00:20:15,955
I've only seen paintings
of that painting.

247
00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:23,792
No!

248
00:20:25,137 --> 00:20:27,901
The legendary Urn
of Whispering Warriors.

249
00:20:27,973 --> 00:20:31,136
Said to contain the souls
of the entire Tenshu Army.

250
00:20:34,513 --> 00:20:35,639
Hello.

251
00:20:35,714 --> 00:20:38,046
Have you finished sight-seeing?

252
00:20:38,116 --> 00:20:40,209
Sorry, I should have come to you first.

253
00:20:40,285 --> 00:20:42,253
My patience is wearing thin.

254
00:20:42,321 --> 00:20:45,154
Well, I mean, it's not like you
were going anywhere.

255
00:20:45,224 --> 00:20:47,590
- Would you turn around?
- Sure.

256
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:48,683
How's it going?

257
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,194
How do you get 5,000...
Master Shifu!

258
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:55,562
Someone... broke that.

259
00:20:55,634 --> 00:20:58,000
But I'll fix it. Do you have some...

260
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:00,165
...glue?

261
00:21:03,175 --> 00:21:04,164
A splinter.

262
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:07,235
So you're the legendary Dragon Warrior?

263
00:21:07,312 --> 00:21:10,440
- I guess so.
- Wrong!

264
00:21:10,515 --> 00:21:14,246
You are not the Dragon Warrior. You will
never be the Dragon Warrior until...

265
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:17,254
...you have learned the secret
of the Dragon Scroll.

266
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,892
So, how does this work?

267
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,861
Do you have a ladder,
or a trampoline, or?

268
00:21:26,198 --> 00:21:30,225
You think it's that easy?
That I'll just hand you the secret

269
00:21:30,302 --> 00:21:32,202
- to limitless power?
- No, I...

270
00:21:32,271 --> 00:21:35,297
One must first master
the highest level of kung fu.

271
00:21:35,374 --> 00:21:39,435
And that is impossible
if that one is someone like you.

272
00:21:39,511 --> 00:21:40,535
Someone like me?

273
00:21:40,612 --> 00:21:45,276
Yes, look at you!
This fat butt! Flabby arms!

274
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,818
Those are sensitive in the flabby parts.

275
00:21:47,886 --> 00:21:50,719
And this ridiculous belly.

276
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:54,054
And utter disregard
for personal hygiene.

277
00:21:54,126 --> 00:21:56,287
Now, wait a minute.
That's uncalled for.

278
00:21:56,361 --> 00:21:58,886
Don't stand that close.
I can smell your breath.

279
00:21:58,997 --> 00:22:00,862
Listen, Oogway said I was...

280
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:03,595
The Wuxi Finger Hold.
Not the Wuxi Finger Hold!

281
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:06,399
Oh, you know this hold?

282
00:22:06,471 --> 00:22:09,133
Developed by Master Wuxi
in the Third Dynasty.

283
00:22:09,207 --> 00:22:11,971
Then you know what happens
when I flex my pinky.

284
00:22:12,844 --> 00:22:15,506
- No, no!
- You know the hardest part of this?

285
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:19,448
The hardest part is cleaning up
afterwards.

286
00:22:19,518 --> 00:22:21,645
OK, OK, take it easy.

287
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,154
Now listen closely, panda.

288
00:22:24,222 --> 00:22:27,350
Oogway may have picked you,
but when I'm through with you,

289
00:22:27,426 --> 00:22:32,329
I promise you, you're going to wish
he hadn't! Are we clear?

290
00:22:32,497 --> 00:22:35,625
Yeah, we're clear. We're so clear.

291
00:22:35,701 --> 00:22:37,430
Good.

292
00:22:37,502 --> 00:22:39,436
I can't wait to get started.

293
00:23:19,044 --> 00:23:21,308
- Let's begin.
- Wait, wait, wait.

294
00:23:21,613 --> 00:23:22,910
What?

295
00:23:24,483 --> 00:23:26,951
- Now?
- Yes, now.

296
00:23:27,018 --> 00:23:31,318
Unless the great Oogway was wrong
and you are not the Dragon Warrior.

297
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,948
Oh, OK, well...

298
00:23:33,024 --> 00:23:37,017
I don't know
if I can do all of those moves.

299
00:23:37,095 --> 00:23:39,859
Well, if we don't try,
we'll never know, will we?

300
00:23:39,931 --> 00:23:43,765
Yeah, it's just, maybe we can find
something more suited to my level.

301
00:23:43,835 --> 00:23:44,893
What level is that?

302
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:48,428
Well, I'm not a master, but...

303
00:23:48,507 --> 00:23:51,271
...let's just start at zero. Level zero.

304
00:23:51,343 --> 00:23:55,439
No. There is no such thing
as level zero.

305
00:23:55,514 --> 00:23:58,278
- Maybe I can start with that.
- That?

306
00:23:58,383 --> 00:24:03,446
We use that for training children and
propping the door open when it's hot.

307
00:24:03,488 --> 00:24:04,853
But if you insist...

308
00:24:04,923 --> 00:24:07,687
The Furious Five!

309
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:12,025
You're bigger than your action figures.
Except, you, Mantis. You're the same.

310
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,860
Go ahead, panda.
Show us what you can do.

311
00:24:19,738 --> 00:24:23,105
Are they gonna watch, or should I wait
till they get back to work?

312
00:24:23,175 --> 00:24:24,164
Hit it.

313
00:24:24,276 --> 00:24:28,906
OK, yeah. I mean, I just ate.
So I'm still digesting.

314
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,746
So my kung fu might not be
as good as... later on.

315
00:24:32,818 --> 00:24:33,944
Just hit it.

316
00:24:34,786 --> 00:24:35,912
All right.

317
00:24:36,888 --> 00:24:40,289
What you got? You got nothing,
'cause I got it right here.

318
00:24:40,358 --> 00:24:43,384
You picking on my friends?
Get ready to feel thunder.

319
00:24:43,462 --> 00:24:45,657
I'm coming at you with crazy feet.

320
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:48,722
Come on. I'm a blur.
You've never seen bear style.

321
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,597
You've only seen praying mantis.

322
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:52,603
Or monkey style.

323
00:24:53,271 --> 00:24:55,603
Or I could come at you snickety-snake.

324
00:24:55,674 --> 00:24:58,040
Would you hit it!

325
00:24:58,143 --> 00:25:00,270
All right. All right.

326
00:25:05,984 --> 00:25:09,078
Why don't you try again?
A little harder.

327
00:25:10,822 --> 00:25:12,084
How's that?

328
00:25:22,868 --> 00:25:24,358
That hurts.

329
00:25:31,376 --> 00:25:33,537
This will be easier than I thought.

330
00:25:33,612 --> 00:25:36,103
I'm feeling a little nauseous!

331
00:25:36,948 --> 00:25:38,245
Those are hard!

332
00:25:42,621 --> 00:25:44,054
My tenders.

333
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,845
How did I do?

334
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,719
There is now a level zero.

335
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:17,889
- There's no words.
- No denying that.

336
00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:20,187
- There's no words.
- No denying that.

337
00:26:20,258 --> 00:26:22,590
What was Master Oogway thinking?

338
00:26:22,661 --> 00:26:24,959
The poor guy's gonna get himself killed.

339
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,521
He is so mighty!

340
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:32,434
The Dragon Warrior fell out of the sky
on a ball of fire!

341
00:26:32,504 --> 00:26:35,337
When he walks, the very ground shakes!

342
00:26:36,341 --> 00:26:40,607
One would think Master Oogway would
choose someone who knew kung fu.

343
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:42,704
Yeah, or could at least touch his toes.

344
00:26:42,781 --> 00:26:45,181
Or even see his toes.

345
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:10,701
OK.

346
00:27:19,517 --> 00:27:21,144
Great.

347
00:27:36,001 --> 00:27:37,593
Hi. You're up.

348
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:39,068
I am now.

349
00:27:39,237 --> 00:27:40,636
I was just...

350
00:27:40,705 --> 00:27:42,605
Some day, huh?

351
00:27:42,674 --> 00:27:47,077
That kung fu stuff is hard work, right?
Are your biceps sore?

352
00:27:48,113 --> 00:27:52,914
I've had a long
and rather disappointing day, so...

353
00:27:53,652 --> 00:27:56,985
Yeah, I should probably
get to sleep now.

354
00:27:57,088 --> 00:27:59,522
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
- OK, thanks.

355
00:27:59,557 --> 00:28:02,424
It's just...
Man, I'm such a big fan!

356
00:28:02,494 --> 00:28:05,190
You guys were amazing
at the Battle of Weeping River.

357
00:28:05,263 --> 00:28:08,755
Outnumbered a thousand to one,
but you didn't stop. You just...

358
00:28:11,536 --> 00:28:13,868
Sorry about that.

359
00:28:13,938 --> 00:28:16,429
Look, you don't belong here.

360
00:28:18,143 --> 00:28:21,044
I know. I know. You're right.

361
00:28:21,112 --> 00:28:23,603
I don't have... I just...

362
00:28:23,682 --> 00:28:25,206
My whole life I dreamed of...

363
00:28:25,283 --> 00:28:30,152
No, I meant you don't belong here.
I mean, in this room. This is my room.

364
00:28:31,523 --> 00:28:33,582
Property of Crane.

365
00:28:33,658 --> 00:28:35,523
OK. Right, right.

366
00:28:35,593 --> 00:28:38,118
So, you want to get to sleep.

367
00:28:38,196 --> 00:28:39,993
- Yeah.
- I'm keeping you up.

368
00:28:40,065 --> 00:28:42,192
We got big things tomorrow.

369
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:46,465
All right. You're awesome.
Last thing I'm gonna say. Bye-bye.

370
00:28:50,308 --> 00:28:51,468
What was that?

371
00:28:51,543 --> 00:28:52,976
I didn't say anything.

372
00:28:53,044 --> 00:28:55,205
OK. All right. Good night.

373
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,474
Sleep well.

374
00:28:59,284 --> 00:29:01,149
That seemed a little awkward.

375
00:29:03,121 --> 00:29:05,612
Master Tigress!
I didn't mean to wake you.

376
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:08,386
- You don't belong here.
- Yeah, of course.

377
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,757
This is your room.

378
00:29:09,828 --> 00:29:13,127
I mean, you don't belong
in the Jade Palace.

379
00:29:13,198 --> 00:29:15,564
You're a disgrace to kung fu,
and if you have

380
00:29:15,633 --> 00:29:19,262
any respect for who we are
and what we do,

381
00:29:19,604 --> 00:29:21,765
you will be gone by morning.

382
00:29:27,212 --> 00:29:28,839
Big fan!

383
00:29:36,254 --> 00:29:40,088
I see you have found the Sacred
Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.

384
00:29:42,427 --> 00:29:47,126
Is that what this is? Sorry. I thought
it was just a regular peach tree.

385
00:29:47,198 --> 00:29:52,135
I understand.
You eat when you are upset.

386
00:29:52,203 --> 00:29:56,196
Upset? I'm not upset.
What makes you think I'm upset.

387
00:29:57,475 --> 00:29:59,875
So why are you so upset?

388
00:30:05,016 --> 00:30:08,543
I probably sucked more today
than anyone in the history of kung fu.

389
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:12,249
In the history of China.
In the history of sucking!

390
00:30:12,323 --> 00:30:13,415
Probably.

391
00:30:13,491 --> 00:30:17,188
And the Five! Man, you should've
seen them! They totally hate me.

392
00:30:17,262 --> 00:30:18,251
Totally.

393
00:30:18,329 --> 00:30:22,390
How is Shifu ever going to turn me
into the Dragon Warrior?

394
00:30:24,536 --> 00:30:26,436
I mean, I'm not like the Five.

395
00:30:26,504 --> 00:30:30,065
I've got no claws, no wings, no venom.

396
00:30:30,141 --> 00:30:33,076
Even Mantis has those... thingies.

397
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:38,080
Maybe I should just quit
and go back to making noodles.

398
00:30:41,252 --> 00:30:43,413
Quit, don't quit.

399
00:30:43,488 --> 00:30:47,515
Noodles, don't noodles.

400
00:30:47,592 --> 00:30:52,256
You are too concerned
with what was and what will be.

401
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,195
There's a saying:

402
00:30:54,265 --> 00:30:56,699
Yesterday is history,

403
00:30:56,801 --> 00:30:59,235
tomorrow is a mystery,

404
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:02,398
but today is a gift.

405
00:31:02,473 --> 00:31:05,271
That is why it is called the present.

406
00:31:35,273 --> 00:31:37,639
- Oh, no!
- What's happening?!

407
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:40,200
To your battle stations! Go! Go! Go!

408
00:31:48,953 --> 00:31:50,580
Fire crossbows!

409
00:31:50,655 --> 00:31:51,986
Fire!

410
00:31:54,626 --> 00:31:55,650
Fire!

411
00:32:03,301 --> 00:32:05,997
Tai Lung is free! I must warn Shifu.

412
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,903
- Not going anywhere! Neither is he!
- Let go of me!

413
00:32:08,973 --> 00:32:10,099
Bring it up!

414
00:32:12,844 --> 00:32:14,334
Wait! Bring it back!

415
00:32:33,131 --> 00:32:37,124
- He's coming this way!
- He won't get far. Archers!

416
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:48,100
We're dead. So very, very dead.

417
00:33:48,806 --> 00:33:50,865
Not yet we're not. Now!

418
00:34:38,556 --> 00:34:41,252
- Can we run now?
- Yes.

419
00:35:02,113 --> 00:35:03,512
I'm glad Shifu sent you.

420
00:35:05,783 --> 00:35:08,616
I was beginning to think
I'd been forgotten.

421
00:35:08,686 --> 00:35:10,711
Fly back there and tell them...

422
00:35:10,788 --> 00:35:14,519
...the real Dragon Warrior
is coming home.

423
00:35:26,504 --> 00:35:28,028
Good morning, Master!

424
00:35:29,507 --> 00:35:31,134
Panda!

425
00:35:31,209 --> 00:35:32,198
Panda!

426
00:35:32,577 --> 00:35:33,771
Wake up!

427
00:35:37,315 --> 00:35:38,543
He's quit.

428
00:35:40,551 --> 00:35:45,614
What do we do now, with the panda gone?
Who will be the Dragon Warrior?

429
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:48,784
All we can do is resume our training
and trust that in time,

430
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,488
the true Dragon Warrior
will be revealed.

431
00:35:52,997 --> 00:35:54,521
What are you doing here?!

432
00:35:55,466 --> 00:35:57,457
Hi! Good morning, Master!

433
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,433
I thought I'd warm up a little.

434
00:36:01,572 --> 00:36:02,561
You're stuck.

435
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,006
Stuck? Nah. What? Stuck?

436
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:08,808
Nah. This is one of my...
Yeah, I'm stuck.

437
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,814
- Help him.
- Oh, dear.

438
00:36:11,949 --> 00:36:14,417
Maybe on three. One, two...

439
00:36:15,486 --> 00:36:16,680
...three.

440
00:36:18,456 --> 00:36:20,117
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

441
00:36:20,191 --> 00:36:23,126
- No, really, I appreciate...
- Ever.

442
00:36:23,194 --> 00:36:27,494
You actually thought you could learn
to do a full split in one night?

443
00:36:27,565 --> 00:36:30,932
It takes years to develop
one's flexibility!

444
00:36:31,002 --> 00:36:34,768
And years longer to apply it in combat!

445
00:36:44,182 --> 00:36:45,706
Put that down!

446
00:36:45,783 --> 00:36:50,277
The only souvenirs we collect here are
bloody knuckles and broken bones.

447
00:36:50,354 --> 00:36:53,289
Yeah! Excellent.

448
00:36:54,091 --> 00:36:55,285
Let's get started.

449
00:36:57,595 --> 00:36:59,460
- Are you ready?
- I was born re...

450
00:37:01,432 --> 00:37:04,424
I'm sorry, brother.
I thought you said you were ready.

451
00:37:04,502 --> 00:37:07,801
That was awesome! Let's go again!

452
00:37:34,165 --> 00:37:37,100
I've been taking it easy on you, panda.
But no more.

453
00:37:37,168 --> 00:37:39,500
Your next opponent will be me.

454
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,333
All right! Yeah, let's go!

455
00:37:43,841 --> 00:37:45,900
Step forth.

456
00:37:45,977 --> 00:37:49,435
The true path to victory is to find
your opponent's weakness...

457
00:37:49,513 --> 00:37:51,378
...and make him suffer for it.

458
00:37:51,449 --> 00:37:52,780
Oh, yeah!

459
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:56,217
To take his strength
and use it against him...

460
00:37:56,287 --> 00:37:58,778
...until he finally falls...

461
00:37:58,889 --> 00:37:59,878
...or quits.

462
00:37:59,924 --> 00:38:01,915
A real warrior never quits.

463
00:38:01,993 --> 00:38:05,190
Don't worry, Master. I will never quit!

464
00:38:15,573 --> 00:38:18,770
If he's smart,
he won't come back up those steps.

465
00:38:18,843 --> 00:38:20,174
But he will.

466
00:38:20,244 --> 00:38:22,542
He's not going to quit, is he?

467
00:38:22,613 --> 00:38:25,377
He's not going to quit bouncing,
I'll tell you that.

468
00:38:37,261 --> 00:38:40,321
I thought you said acupuncture
would make me feel better.

469
00:38:40,398 --> 00:38:41,422
Trust me, it will.

470
00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:45,128
It's just not easy finding the right
nerve points under all this...

471
00:38:45,202 --> 00:38:47,864
- Fat?
- Fur. I was going to say fur.

472
00:38:47,938 --> 00:38:48,927
Sure you were.

473
00:38:49,006 --> 00:38:53,067
Who am I to judge a warrior
based on his size? Look at me.

474
00:38:54,245 --> 00:38:55,234
I'm over here.

475
00:38:56,347 --> 00:38:58,781
Maybe you should look at this again.

476
00:38:58,883 --> 00:39:01,283
Oh, OK.

477
00:39:04,088 --> 00:39:06,079
Stop it. Stop!

478
00:39:07,258 --> 00:39:10,193
I know Master Shifu is trying
to inspire me and all...

479
00:39:10,528 --> 00:39:14,191
...but if I didn't know better,
I'd say he was trying to get rid of me.

480
00:39:19,136 --> 00:39:21,536
I know he can seem kind of heartless...

481
00:39:22,173 --> 00:39:24,141
...but he wasn't always like that.

482
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:25,539
According to legend,

483
00:39:25,609 --> 00:39:30,137
there was once a time when
Master Shifu actually used to smile.

484
00:39:30,214 --> 00:39:32,148
- No!
- Yes.

485
00:39:32,216 --> 00:39:33,478
But that was before.

486
00:39:33,551 --> 00:39:35,542
Before what?

487
00:39:35,619 --> 00:39:36,950
Before Tai Lung.

488
00:39:37,054 --> 00:39:39,614
We're not really supposed
to talk about him.

489
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:42,682
Well, if he's going to stay here,
he should know.

490
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,694
Guys, guys, I know about Tai Lung.

491
00:39:44,762 --> 00:39:50,223
He was a student. The first ever to
master the thousand scrolls of kung fu.

492
00:39:50,301 --> 00:39:54,465
And then he turned bad,
and now he's in jail.

493
00:39:54,538 --> 00:39:56,665
He wasn't just a student.

494
00:40:01,011 --> 00:40:03,844
Shifu found him as a cub...

495
00:40:05,483 --> 00:40:08,418
...and he raised him as his son.

496
00:40:10,788 --> 00:40:13,848
And when the boy showed
talent in kung fu...

497
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:17,223
...Shifu trained him.

498
00:40:17,294 --> 00:40:21,424
He believed in him. He told him
he was destined for greatness.

499
00:40:23,134 --> 00:40:24,863
It was never enough for Tai Lung.

500
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:29,197
He wanted the Dragon Scroll.

501
00:40:29,273 --> 00:40:33,573
But Oogway saw darkness
in his heart and refused.

502
00:40:33,911 --> 00:40:37,608
Outraged, Tai Lung
laid waste to the valley.

503
00:40:40,084 --> 00:40:42,109
He tried to take the scroll by force.

504
00:40:42,186 --> 00:40:46,782
And Shifu had to destroy
what he had created.

505
00:40:48,759 --> 00:40:50,317
But how could he?

506
00:41:04,475 --> 00:41:08,639
Shifu loved Tai Lung
like he had never loved anyone before.

507
00:41:16,887 --> 00:41:18,149
Or since.

508
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:29,497
And now he has a chance
to make things right.

509
00:41:29,567 --> 00:41:31,797
To train the true Dragon Warrior.

510
00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:34,895
And he's stuck with you.

511
00:41:34,972 --> 00:41:38,840
A big fat panda
who treats it like a joke.

512
00:41:39,743 --> 00:41:40,732
That is it!

513
00:41:40,811 --> 00:41:43,939
Wait! My fault!
I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve.

514
00:41:46,383 --> 00:41:48,851
And may have also stopped his heart.

515
00:41:52,523 --> 00:41:54,081
Inner peace.

516
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,350
Inner peace.

517
00:42:00,331 --> 00:42:02,026
Inner...

518
00:42:03,634 --> 00:42:05,534
Inner peace.

519
00:42:08,506 --> 00:42:13,034
Would whoever is making
that flapping sound quiet down?!

520
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,542
Inner...

521
00:42:22,152 --> 00:42:24,211
Oh, Zeng.

522
00:42:24,288 --> 00:42:25,880
Excellent.

523
00:42:25,956 --> 00:42:27,890
I could use some good news right now.

524
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:37,031
Master! Master!

525
00:42:37,701 --> 00:42:41,967
I have... It's...
It's very bad news.

526
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:44,405
Shifu.

527
00:42:44,475 --> 00:42:47,876
There is just news.
There is no good or bad.

528
00:42:47,945 --> 00:42:51,608
Master, your vision.
Your vision was right.

529
00:42:51,682 --> 00:42:55,083
Tai Lung has broken out of prison.
He's on his way.

530
00:42:56,554 --> 00:42:59,284
That is bad news...

531
00:42:59,356 --> 00:43:03,690
...if you do not believe
that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.

532
00:43:03,761 --> 00:43:08,027
The panda? Master,
that panda is not the Dragon Warrior.

533
00:43:08,098 --> 00:43:11,397
He wasn't meant to be here!
It was an accident.

534
00:43:11,468 --> 00:43:13,766
There are no accidents.

535
00:43:15,005 --> 00:43:18,133
Yes, I know. You've said that already.

536
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:22,406
- Twice.
- Well, that was no accident, either.

537
00:43:22,479 --> 00:43:23,571
Thrice.

538
00:43:23,647 --> 00:43:25,274
My old friend,

539
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:29,945
the panda will never fulfill
his destiny, nor you yours,

540
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:33,581
until you let go
of the illusion of control.

541
00:43:33,657 --> 00:43:35,022
Illusion?

542
00:43:35,092 --> 00:43:38,084
Yes. Look at this tree, Shifu.

543
00:43:38,162 --> 00:43:41,188
I cannot make it blossom
when it suits me,

544
00:43:41,265 --> 00:43:44,530
nor make it bear fruit
before its time.

545
00:43:44,602 --> 00:43:47,127
But there are things we can control.

546
00:43:48,205 --> 00:43:51,299
I can control when the fruit will fall.

547
00:43:52,376 --> 00:43:54,071
And I can control...

548
00:43:55,145 --> 00:43:57,136
...where to plant the seed.

549
00:43:57,648 --> 00:43:59,741
That is no illusion, Master.

550
00:44:01,385 --> 00:44:03,376
Yes.

551
00:44:03,454 --> 00:44:05,854
But no matter what you do

552
00:44:05,923 --> 00:44:08,858
that seed will grow to be a peach tree.

553
00:44:08,926 --> 00:44:13,795
You may wish for an apple or an orange,
but you will get a peach.

554
00:44:13,864 --> 00:44:17,493
But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!

555
00:44:17,568 --> 00:44:20,230
Maybe it can.

556
00:44:20,304 --> 00:44:23,102
If you are willing to guide it.

557
00:44:23,173 --> 00:44:25,038
To nurture it.

558
00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:26,508
To believe in it.

559
00:44:26,577 --> 00:44:29,045
But how? How?

560
00:44:29,113 --> 00:44:31,081
I need your help, Master.

561
00:44:31,148 --> 00:44:34,845
No, you just need to believe.

562
00:44:35,552 --> 00:44:37,850
Promise me, Shifu.

563
00:44:38,455 --> 00:44:41,151
Promise me you will believe.

564
00:44:41,225 --> 00:44:44,786
I will try.

565
00:44:45,629 --> 00:44:47,119
Good.

566
00:44:49,299 --> 00:44:51,358
My time has come.

567
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:57,939
You must continue
your journey without me.

568
00:44:58,042 --> 00:44:59,737
What are you? Wait!

569
00:45:01,845 --> 00:45:03,142
Master!

570
00:45:03,981 --> 00:45:05,539
You can't leave me!

571
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:11,947
You must believe.

572
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:14,482
Master!

573
00:45:44,922 --> 00:45:47,584
Yeah, so I'm like,
"Fine, you may be a wolf,

574
00:45:47,658 --> 00:45:50,593
you may be the scariest bandit
in Haijin Province...

575
00:45:50,928 --> 00:45:52,759
...but you're a lousy tipper."

576
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:55,765
Really? So how did you
get out of there alive?

577
00:45:56,633 --> 00:45:58,931
I mean, I didn't actually say that...

578
00:45:59,269 --> 00:46:00,736
...but I thought it...

579
00:46:00,804 --> 00:46:02,567
...in my mind.

580
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:05,699
If he could read my mind,
he'd be, like, "What?"

581
00:46:06,276 --> 00:46:08,437
Order up! Hope you like it.

582
00:46:10,347 --> 00:46:13,578
- This is really good!
- No, come on.

583
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:17,950
Try my dad's Secret Ingredient Soup.
He actually knows the secret ingredient.

584
00:46:18,021 --> 00:46:20,421
What do you mean? This is amazing!

585
00:46:20,491 --> 00:46:23,426
- You're a really good cook.
- I wish my mouth was bigger.

586
00:46:23,494 --> 00:46:25,394
Tigress, you've got to try this.

587
00:46:25,462 --> 00:46:29,091
It is said that the Dragon Warrior
can survive for months

588
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:33,967
on nothing but the dew of ginkgo leaf
and the energy of the universe.

589
00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:39,241
I guess my body doesn't know
it's the Dragon Warrior yet.

590
00:46:39,309 --> 00:46:44,303
I'm gonna need a lot more
than dew and universe juice.

591
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:51,813
- What?
- Nothing... Master Shifu.

592
00:46:54,591 --> 00:46:58,618
Never be the Dragon Warrior unless you
lose 500 pounds and brush your teeth!

593
00:46:59,863 --> 00:47:03,299
What is that noise you're making?
Laughter? I never heard of it!

594
00:47:03,367 --> 00:47:06,200
Work hard, panda, and maybe someday...

595
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:08,170
...you will have ears like mine.

596
00:47:09,773 --> 00:47:11,172
That's good.

597
00:47:11,775 --> 00:47:15,176
Ears. It's not working for you?
I thought they were pretty good.

598
00:47:15,512 --> 00:47:16,638
It's Shifu!

599
00:47:16,713 --> 00:47:19,546
Of course it's Shifu.
What do you think I'm doing?

600
00:47:21,351 --> 00:47:22,943
Master Shifu!

601
00:47:25,989 --> 00:47:27,684
You think this is funny?

602
00:47:27,758 --> 00:47:30,727
Tai Lung has escaped
and you're acting like children!

603
00:47:30,794 --> 00:47:33,092
- What?
- He is coming for the Dragon Scroll,

604
00:47:33,163 --> 00:47:35,529
and you are the only one
who can stop him.

605
00:47:39,203 --> 00:47:41,831
And I was saying
you got no sense of humor.

606
00:47:41,905 --> 00:47:44,203
I'm gonna... stop Tai Lung.

607
00:47:44,274 --> 00:47:47,107
What? You're serious? And I have to?

608
00:47:48,979 --> 00:47:51,948
Master Oogway will stop him,
like he did before.

609
00:47:52,015 --> 00:47:53,539
Oogway cannot!

610
00:47:54,051 --> 00:47:55,450
Not anymore.

611
00:47:56,954 --> 00:47:59,650
Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.

612
00:47:59,723 --> 00:48:01,350
- The panda?
- Yes, the panda!

613
00:48:01,425 --> 00:48:05,020
Master, let us stop Tai Lung.
This is what you've trained us for.

614
00:48:05,095 --> 00:48:08,656
No! It is not your destiny
to defeat Tai Lung.

615
00:48:08,732 --> 00:48:10,324
It is his!

616
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,526
Where'd he go?

617
00:48:18,876 --> 00:48:22,175
You cannot leave!
A real warrior never quits.

618
00:48:22,246 --> 00:48:23,804
Watch me.

619
00:48:26,416 --> 00:48:27,508
Come on.

620
00:48:27,584 --> 00:48:31,418
How am I supposed to beat Tai Lung?
I can't even beat you to the stairs.

621
00:48:31,488 --> 00:48:34,480
You will beat him
because you are the Dragon Warrior.

622
00:48:35,292 --> 00:48:38,557
You don't believe that.
You never believed that.

623
00:48:38,629 --> 00:48:41,621
From the beginning,
you've tried to get rid of me.

624
00:48:41,698 --> 00:48:44,030
Yes! I was.

625
00:48:44,101 --> 00:48:49,232
But now I ask you to trust in your
master as I have come to trust in mine.

626
00:48:50,307 --> 00:48:54,038
You're not my master.
And I'm not the Dragon Warrior.

627
00:48:54,111 --> 00:48:58,445
Then why didn't you quit?! You knew
I wanted you gone, yet you stayed.

628
00:48:58,548 --> 00:49:00,573
Yeah, I stayed.

629
00:49:00,617 --> 00:49:04,383
I stayed because every time
you threw a brick at my head

630
00:49:04,454 --> 00:49:08,857
or said I smelled, it hurt,
but it could never hurt more

631
00:49:08,926 --> 00:49:12,157
than it did every day
of my life just being me.

632
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:17,464
I stayed because I thought,
if anyone could change me...

633
00:49:17,801 --> 00:49:20,861
...could make me... not me...

634
00:49:20,938 --> 00:49:22,303
...it was you.

635
00:49:22,539 --> 00:49:25,508
The greatest kung fu teacher
in all of China!

636
00:49:25,575 --> 00:49:27,167
But I can change you!

637
00:49:27,244 --> 00:49:30,771
I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior!
And I will!

638
00:49:30,847 --> 00:49:34,840
Come on. Tai Lung is
on his way here right now.

639
00:49:34,918 --> 00:49:38,319
Even if it takes him a hundred years
to get here, how are you...

640
00:49:38,388 --> 00:49:42,654
...gonna change this
into the Dragon Warrior?

641
00:49:44,962 --> 00:49:45,951
How?

642
00:49:47,597 --> 00:49:48,586
How?

643
00:49:51,635 --> 00:49:53,830
- How?!
- I don't know!

644
00:50:01,878 --> 00:50:03,436
I don't know.

645
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,250
That's what I thought.

646
00:50:50,894 --> 00:50:53,055
This is what you trained me for.

647
00:51:00,203 --> 00:51:01,192
Tigress!

648
00:51:05,442 --> 00:51:07,239
Don't try and stop me.

649
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,504
We're not trying to stop you.

650
00:51:11,581 --> 00:51:12,570
What?

651
00:51:12,649 --> 00:51:14,514
We're coming with you!

652
00:52:27,691 --> 00:52:31,218
What? I eat when I'm upset, OK?

653
00:52:32,462 --> 00:52:33,827
No need to explain.

654
00:52:33,897 --> 00:52:38,061
I thought you might be Monkey. He hides
his almond cookies on the top shelf.

655
00:52:58,989 --> 00:53:00,684
Don't tell Monkey.

656
00:53:00,757 --> 00:53:03,920
- Look at you.
- Yeah, I know, I disgust you.

657
00:53:03,994 --> 00:53:06,986
No, I mean, how did you get up there?

658
00:53:07,063 --> 00:53:09,827
I don't know. I guess that...

659
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:12,465
I don't know. I was getting a cookie.

660
00:53:12,536 --> 00:53:14,436
Yet you are ten feet off the ground.

661
00:53:15,472 --> 00:53:17,804
And you have done a perfect spilt.

662
00:53:17,874 --> 00:53:20,843
No, this? This is just...

663
00:53:21,578 --> 00:53:22,909
...an accident.

664
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:30,210
There are no accidents.

665
00:53:30,287 --> 00:53:31,345
Come with me.

666
00:53:39,362 --> 00:53:42,798
I know you're trying to be
all mystical and kung fuey...

667
00:53:42,866 --> 00:53:45,596
...but could you at least
tell me where we're going?

668
00:53:55,512 --> 00:53:57,980
You dragged me...

669
00:53:58,081 --> 00:53:59,776
...all the way out here...

670
00:53:59,816 --> 00:54:01,147
...for a bath?

671
00:54:04,788 --> 00:54:06,119
Panda...

672
00:54:06,189 --> 00:54:09,818
...we do not wash our pits
in the Pool of Sacred Tears.

673
00:54:11,061 --> 00:54:12,085
The Pool of...

674
00:54:12,162 --> 00:54:14,756
This is where Oogway
unraveled the mysteries...

675
00:54:14,831 --> 00:54:17,026
...of harmony and focus.

676
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,625
This is the birthplace...

677
00:54:19,703 --> 00:54:20,965
...of kung fu.

678
00:54:34,951 --> 00:54:37,215
Do you want to learn kung fu?

679
00:54:37,287 --> 00:54:38,276
Yeah!

680
00:54:38,355 --> 00:54:41,620
Then I am your master!

681
00:54:41,691 --> 00:54:43,454
OK!

682
00:54:44,794 --> 00:54:45,886
Don't cry.

683
00:54:45,962 --> 00:54:47,293
OK.

684
00:54:53,036 --> 00:54:55,027
When you focus on kung fu,

685
00:54:55,105 --> 00:54:57,232
when you concentrate...

686
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:58,807
...you stink.

687
00:54:58,842 --> 00:55:00,742
Perhaps that is my fault.

688
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:04,268
I cannot train you the way
I have trained the Five.

689
00:55:04,347 --> 00:55:07,441
I now see that the way
to get through to you...

690
00:55:07,517 --> 00:55:08,814
...is with this.

691
00:55:08,885 --> 00:55:11,649
Oh, great, 'cause I am hungry.

692
00:55:12,555 --> 00:55:13,613
Good.

693
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:16,386
When you have been trained, you may eat.

694
00:55:17,827 --> 00:55:18,987
Let us begin.

695
00:56:29,699 --> 00:56:30,791
After you, panda.

696
00:56:30,867 --> 00:56:32,835
Just like that?

697
00:56:32,902 --> 00:56:36,565
No sit-ups? No ten-mile hike?

698
00:56:36,639 --> 00:56:41,133
I vowed to train you, and you
have been trained. You are free to eat.

699
00:56:46,549 --> 00:56:48,141
Enjoy.

700
00:56:49,719 --> 00:56:51,152
Hey!

701
00:56:51,221 --> 00:56:54,349
I said you are free to eat.
Have a dumpling.

702
00:56:55,692 --> 00:56:57,159
Hey!

703
00:57:03,433 --> 00:57:05,401
You are free to eat.

704
00:57:05,468 --> 00:57:07,368
- Am I?!
- Are you?!

705
00:58:33,756 --> 00:58:35,280
I'm not hungry.

706
00:58:38,895 --> 00:58:40,089
Master.

707
00:59:10,226 --> 00:59:11,523
Cut it!

708
00:59:28,745 --> 00:59:30,542
Where's the Dragon Warrior?

709
00:59:30,613 --> 00:59:33,605
How do you know
you're not looking at her?

710
00:59:33,683 --> 00:59:35,878
You think I'm a fool?

711
00:59:35,952 --> 00:59:39,581
I know you're not the Dragon Warrior.
None of you!

712
00:59:39,656 --> 00:59:42,921
I heard how he fell out
of the sky in a ball of fire.

713
00:59:42,992 --> 00:59:47,429
That he's a warrior unlike
anything the world has ever seen.

714
00:59:47,497 --> 00:59:53,094
- Po?
- So that is his name. Po.

715
00:59:53,169 --> 00:59:56,263
Finally, a worthy opponent.

716
00:59:56,339 --> 00:59:58,830
Our battle will be legendary!

717
01:00:18,828 --> 01:00:20,523
We've got this. Help her.

718
01:00:45,154 --> 01:00:46,143
Monkey!

719
01:00:46,222 --> 01:00:48,053
Go!

720
01:00:48,124 --> 01:00:49,318
What was I thinking?!

721
01:00:59,736 --> 01:01:00,760
Mantis!

722
01:01:06,009 --> 01:01:07,442
Now!

723
01:01:53,356 --> 01:01:55,654
Shifu taught you well.

724
01:01:58,628 --> 01:02:00,562
But he didn't teach you everything.

725
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:06,157
You have done well, panda.

726
01:02:06,235 --> 01:02:09,932
Done well? Done well?

727
01:02:10,006 --> 01:02:11,303
I've done awesome!

728
01:02:13,009 --> 01:02:16,206
The mark of a true hero is humility.

729
01:02:16,279 --> 01:02:18,975
But, yes, you have done...

730
01:02:19,582 --> 01:02:20,913
...awesome.

731
01:02:28,157 --> 01:02:31,490
Guys? Guys?! They're dead!

732
01:02:31,561 --> 01:02:34,997
No, they're breathing. They're asleep?
But their eyes are open.

733
01:02:35,064 --> 01:02:37,055
We were no match for his nerve attach.

734
01:02:37,133 --> 01:02:39,363
He's gotten stronger.

735
01:02:39,435 --> 01:02:41,733
Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?

736
01:02:42,939 --> 01:02:43,928
He's too fast!

737
01:02:44,006 --> 01:02:45,564
Sorry, Po.

738
01:02:47,643 --> 01:02:49,201
I thought we could stop him.

739
01:02:49,278 --> 01:02:51,109
He could have killed you.

740
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:52,238
Why didn't he?

741
01:02:52,315 --> 01:02:56,718
So you could come back and strike fear
into our hearts. But it won't work.

742
01:02:56,819 --> 01:03:01,119
It might. I mean, a little.

743
01:03:01,157 --> 01:03:02,385
I'm pretty scared.

744
01:03:02,458 --> 01:03:03,948
You can defeat him, panda!

745
01:03:04,026 --> 01:03:06,961
Are you kidding? If they can't?!

746
01:03:07,029 --> 01:03:10,021
They're five masters. I'm just one me.

747
01:03:10,099 --> 01:03:13,466
But you will have
the one thing that no one else does.

748
01:03:18,808 --> 01:03:21,299
You really believe I'm ready?

749
01:03:21,377 --> 01:03:23,038
You are...

750
01:03:23,112 --> 01:03:24,409
...Po.

751
01:04:13,362 --> 01:04:16,923
Behold the Dragon Scroll.

752
01:04:16,999 --> 01:04:18,933
It is yours.

753
01:04:19,001 --> 01:04:21,936
Wait. What happens when I read it?

754
01:04:22,004 --> 01:04:26,031
Legend says you will be able
to hear a butterfly's wing beat.

755
01:04:26,108 --> 01:04:28,338
Really? That's cool.

756
01:04:28,411 --> 01:04:31,244
Yes. And see light in the deepest cave.

757
01:04:31,314 --> 01:04:34,215
You will feel the universe
in motion around you.

758
01:04:34,884 --> 01:04:36,317
Can I punch through walls?

759
01:04:36,385 --> 01:04:38,751
- Do a quadruple back flip?
- Focus.

760
01:04:38,821 --> 01:04:40,015
- Will I?
- Focus.

761
01:04:40,423 --> 01:04:41,822
- Focus.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

762
01:04:41,891 --> 01:04:44,792
Read it, Po, and fulfill your destiny.

763
01:04:44,861 --> 01:04:47,056
Read it and become...

764
01:04:47,129 --> 01:04:48,858
...the Dragon Warrior.

765
01:04:55,771 --> 01:04:57,204
It's impossible to open.

766
01:04:58,174 --> 01:05:01,405
OK. Come on, baby. Come on now.

767
01:05:03,646 --> 01:05:05,273
Thank you.

768
01:05:05,348 --> 01:05:07,748
I probably loosened it up
for you though.

769
01:05:09,051 --> 01:05:10,575
OK, here goes.

770
01:05:22,598 --> 01:05:24,259
- It's blank.
- What?!

771
01:05:24,333 --> 01:05:27,928
- Here, look.
- No, I am forbidden to look upon...

772
01:05:33,643 --> 01:05:36,510
Blank. I don't...

773
01:05:36,612 --> 01:05:38,773
I don't understand.

774
01:05:40,082 --> 01:05:42,778
OK. So, like...

775
01:05:42,852 --> 01:05:46,083
...Oogway was
just a crazy old turtle after all.

776
01:05:46,155 --> 01:05:48,749
No. Oogway was wiser than us all.

777
01:05:48,824 --> 01:05:52,885
Oh, come on! Face it,
he picked me by accident.

778
01:05:52,962 --> 01:05:57,092
Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior.
Who am I kidding?

779
01:05:58,134 --> 01:05:59,829
But who will stop Tai Lung?

780
01:05:59,902 --> 01:06:02,393
He'll destroy everything and everyone.

781
01:06:02,471 --> 01:06:04,132
No.

782
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:09,969
Evacuate the valley. You must protect
the villagers from Tai Lung's rage.

783
01:06:10,046 --> 01:06:12,446
- What about you, Master?
- I will fight him.

784
01:06:12,515 --> 01:06:15,211
- What?
- I can hold him off long enough

785
01:06:15,284 --> 01:06:16,751
for everyone to escape.

786
01:06:16,819 --> 01:06:19,253
But, Shifu, he'll kill you.

787
01:06:19,322 --> 01:06:22,155
Then I will finally have paid
for my mistake.

788
01:06:23,125 --> 01:06:25,218
Listen to me, all of you.

789
01:06:25,294 --> 01:06:28,821
It is time for you to continue
your journey without me.

790
01:06:28,898 --> 01:06:31,890
I am very proud
to have been your master.

791
01:06:52,688 --> 01:06:55,054
We've got to get them out safely.

792
01:06:55,124 --> 01:06:57,456
Come, little one. Let's find your mama.

793
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:01,052
Viper, gather the southern farmers.
Mantis, the north.

794
01:07:01,097 --> 01:07:02,860
Crane, light the way.

795
01:07:21,917 --> 01:07:24,943
Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.

796
01:07:33,662 --> 01:07:35,061
Hey, Dad.

797
01:07:35,664 --> 01:07:36,961
Po!

798
01:07:42,872 --> 01:07:44,965
Good to have you back, son.

799
01:07:47,443 --> 01:07:48,933
Good to be back.

800
01:07:49,011 --> 01:07:50,638
Let's go, Po.

801
01:07:53,149 --> 01:07:55,982
So for our next shop,
it's time to face it...

802
01:07:56,252 --> 01:07:59,744
...the future of noodles
is dice-cut vegetables...

803
01:08:00,089 --> 01:08:02,182
...no longer slices.

804
01:08:02,258 --> 01:08:05,694
Also, I was thinking, maybe this time

805
01:08:05,761 --> 01:08:08,924
we'll have a kitchen
you can actually stand up in.

806
01:08:10,232 --> 01:08:11,426
You like that?

807
01:08:17,573 --> 01:08:22,169
Po, I'm sorry if things didn't work out.

808
01:08:22,244 --> 01:08:25,270
It just wasn't meant to be.

809
01:08:28,751 --> 01:08:31,242
Po, forget everything else.

810
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,515
Your destiny still awaits.

811
01:08:33,589 --> 01:08:38,356
We are noodle folk.
Broth runs deep through our veins.

812
01:08:38,461 --> 01:08:40,725
I don't know, Dad.

813
01:08:40,796 --> 01:08:44,789
Honestly, sometimes
I can't believe I'm actually your son.

814
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:49,262
Po...

815
01:08:49,338 --> 01:08:53,775
...I think it's time I told you
something I should have told you...

816
01:08:53,843 --> 01:08:55,902
...a long time ago.

817
01:08:55,978 --> 01:08:57,707
OK.

818
01:08:59,081 --> 01:09:03,211
The secret ingredient
of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

819
01:09:05,955 --> 01:09:10,585
Come here. The secret ingredient is...

820
01:09:10,659 --> 01:09:11,648
...nothing.

821
01:09:13,129 --> 01:09:15,563
You heard me. Nothing!

822
01:09:15,631 --> 01:09:18,099
There is no secret ingredient!

823
01:09:18,167 --> 01:09:21,227
Wait, wait.
It's just plain old noodle soup?

824
01:09:21,303 --> 01:09:24,170
You don't add some kind of special
sauce or something?

825
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:28,643
Don't have to. To make something
special, you just believe it's special.

826
01:09:39,321 --> 01:09:41,812
There is no secret ingredient.

827
01:10:04,413 --> 01:10:07,211
I have come home, Master.

828
01:10:07,283 --> 01:10:10,548
This is no longer your home.
And I am no longer your master.

829
01:10:10,619 --> 01:10:14,555
Oh, yes. You have a new favorite.

830
01:10:14,623 --> 01:10:17,717
So where is this Po?

831
01:10:19,161 --> 01:10:20,389
Did I scare him off?

832
01:10:20,462 --> 01:10:22,794
This battle is between you and me.

833
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:27,636
So, that is how it's going to be.

834
01:10:27,703 --> 01:10:29,728
That is how it must be.

835
01:10:43,886 --> 01:10:48,448
I rotted in jail for 20 years
because of your weakness!

836
01:10:48,524 --> 01:10:50,890
Obeying your master is not weakness!

837
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,758
You knew I was the Dragon Warrior.

838
01:10:53,829 --> 01:10:55,990
You always knew.

839
01:10:56,065 --> 01:11:01,002
But when Oogway said otherwise,
what did you do?

840
01:11:02,137 --> 01:11:04,662
What did you do?!

841
01:11:07,209 --> 01:11:08,335
Nothing!

842
01:11:08,410 --> 01:11:11,243
You were not meant to be the Dragon
Warrior! That was not my fault!

843
01:11:11,313 --> 01:11:13,281
Not your fault?!

844
01:11:13,349 --> 01:11:15,408
Who filled my head with dreams?!

845
01:11:15,484 --> 01:11:17,714
Who drove me to train
until my bones cracked?!

846
01:11:17,786 --> 01:11:20,516
Who denied me my destiny?!

847
01:11:29,765 --> 01:11:32,359
It was never my decision to make!

848
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,137
It is now.

849
01:11:44,213 --> 01:11:47,979
Give me the scroll!

850
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:49,278
I would rather die.

851
01:12:39,435 --> 01:12:42,529
All I ever did, I did to make you proud!

852
01:12:42,705 --> 01:12:45,196
Tell me how proud you are, Shifu!

853
01:12:46,175 --> 01:12:47,665
Tell me!

854
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:49,939
Tell me!

855
01:13:00,255 --> 01:13:03,622
I have...
I have always been proud of you.

856
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:08,093
From the first moment, I've been...

857
01:13:08,163 --> 01:13:10,461
...proud of you.

858
01:13:10,532 --> 01:13:12,898
And it was my pride...

859
01:13:12,968 --> 01:13:14,993
...that blinded me.

860
01:13:15,070 --> 01:13:18,631
I loved you too much
to see what you were becoming...

861
01:13:19,641 --> 01:13:21,905
...what I...

862
01:13:21,977 --> 01:13:23,968
...was turning you into.

863
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:26,748
I'm...

864
01:13:26,815 --> 01:13:27,804
I'm sorry.

865
01:13:36,325 --> 01:13:39,055
I don't want your apology.

866
01:13:39,128 --> 01:13:40,652
I want my scroll!

867
01:13:42,765 --> 01:13:45,097
What?!

868
01:13:45,167 --> 01:13:46,395
Where is it?!

869
01:13:47,403 --> 01:13:51,999
Dragon Warrior has taken the scroll
halfway across China by now.

870
01:13:53,142 --> 01:13:56,270
You will never see
that scroll, Tai Lung.

871
01:13:56,345 --> 01:13:57,676
Never.

872
01:13:58,614 --> 01:13:59,603
Never.

873
01:14:06,555 --> 01:14:07,852
Stairs.

874
01:14:10,292 --> 01:14:12,089
Who are you?

875
01:14:12,161 --> 01:14:17,189
Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior.

876
01:14:20,202 --> 01:14:21,533
You?

877
01:14:22,504 --> 01:14:24,472
Him? He's a panda.

878
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:28,408
You're a panda. What are
you gonna do, big guy? Sit on me?

879
01:14:28,477 --> 01:14:30,411
Don't tempt me.

880
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:34,506
No. I'm gonna use this.

881
01:14:34,583 --> 01:14:36,210
You want it? Come and get it.

882
01:14:37,953 --> 01:14:39,250
Finally!

883
01:15:05,214 --> 01:15:06,681
That scroll is mine!

884
01:16:00,435 --> 01:16:01,459
Lightning!

885
01:16:36,672 --> 01:16:38,663
The scroll has given him power!

886
01:16:39,308 --> 01:16:40,866
No!

887
01:17:17,346 --> 01:17:21,282
Finally! Oh, yes.

888
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:26,219
The power of the Dragon Scroll is mine!

889
01:17:30,525 --> 01:17:32,550
It's nothing!

890
01:17:34,529 --> 01:17:37,123
It's OK. I didn't get it
the first time, either.

891
01:17:37,899 --> 01:17:38,923
What?

892
01:17:40,168 --> 01:17:41,965
There is no secret ingredient.

893
01:17:45,507 --> 01:17:46,735
It's just you.

894
01:17:56,518 --> 01:17:57,576
Stop it!

895
01:17:57,653 --> 01:17:59,416
I'm gonna pee.

896
01:18:00,989 --> 01:18:02,616
Don't.

897
01:18:02,691 --> 01:18:04,352
Don't! Don't!

898
01:19:11,626 --> 01:19:13,423
You...

899
01:19:13,495 --> 01:19:15,725
...can't defeat me.

900
01:19:20,168 --> 01:19:21,396
You...

901
01:19:22,738 --> 01:19:24,535
...you're just a big...

902
01:19:24,606 --> 01:19:26,198
...fat...

903
01:19:26,274 --> 01:19:27,263
...panda!

904
01:19:28,243 --> 01:19:31,371
I'm not a big fat panda.

905
01:19:31,446 --> 01:19:33,744
I'm the big fat panda.

906
01:19:36,017 --> 01:19:37,450
The Wuxi Finger Hold!

907
01:19:37,519 --> 01:19:38,952
Oh, you know this hold?

908
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:42,979
You're bluffing. You're bluffing.
Shifu didn't teach you that.

909
01:19:43,058 --> 01:19:44,753
Nope.

910
01:19:44,826 --> 01:19:47,021
I figured it out. Skadoosh.

911
01:20:07,549 --> 01:20:08,777
Look!

912
01:20:09,818 --> 01:20:11,911
The Dragon Warrior.

913
01:20:39,381 --> 01:20:44,250
That's my boy! That big lovely
kung fu warrior is my son!

914
01:20:46,321 --> 01:20:47,413
Yes!

915
01:20:48,690 --> 01:20:50,248
Thanks, Dad.

916
01:20:59,534 --> 01:21:00,933
Hey, guys.

917
01:21:05,674 --> 01:21:07,005
Master.

918
01:21:07,075 --> 01:21:08,508
Master.

919
01:21:11,413 --> 01:21:13,176
Master?

920
01:21:13,248 --> 01:21:14,715
Master Shifu!

921
01:21:27,762 --> 01:21:29,127
Master!

922
01:21:29,197 --> 01:21:31,290
Shifu, are you OK?!

923
01:21:33,668 --> 01:21:35,067
Po.

924
01:21:35,136 --> 01:21:37,070
You're alive.

925
01:21:37,138 --> 01:21:38,366
Or we're both dead.

926
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:42,376
No, Master, I didn't die.
I defeated Tai Lung.

927
01:21:42,444 --> 01:21:43,570
You did?

928
01:21:47,849 --> 01:21:53,583
Wow. It is as Oogway foretold.

929
01:21:53,655 --> 01:21:57,147
You are the Dragon Warrior.

930
01:21:57,893 --> 01:22:00,361
You have brought peace...

931
01:22:00,428 --> 01:22:03,192
...to this valley...

932
01:22:03,265 --> 01:22:05,460
...and...

933
01:22:05,533 --> 01:22:07,160
...and to me.

934
01:22:07,235 --> 01:22:08,497
Thank you.

935
01:22:10,338 --> 01:22:13,569
Thank you, Po.

936
01:22:13,642 --> 01:22:16,236
Thank you. Thank you.

937
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:26,744
No! Master! No, no, no,
don't die, Shifu, please!

938
01:22:26,821 --> 01:22:29,551
I'm not dying, you idiot!

939
01:22:29,624 --> 01:22:31,592
Dragon Warrior...

940
01:22:32,861 --> 01:22:37,696
...I am simply at peace. Finally.

941
01:22:40,435 --> 01:22:43,370
So, I should stop talking?

942
01:22:44,072 --> 01:22:45,699
If you can.

943
01:23:03,792 --> 01:23:05,384
Want to get something to eat?

944
01:23:08,063 --> 01:23:09,155
Yeah.

945
01:23:15,170 --> 01:23:18,571
Everybody is kung fu fighting

946
01:23:19,407 --> 01:23:22,740
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

947
01:23:23,745 --> 01:23:27,078
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

948
01:23:28,249 --> 01:23:31,741
It's the book of your life
that you're writing

949
01:23:34,856 --> 01:23:37,916
Everybody is kung fu fighting

950
01:23:39,194 --> 01:23:42,425
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

951
01:23:43,431 --> 01:23:46,764
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

952
01:23:48,103 --> 01:23:51,095
It's the book of your life
that you're writing

953
01:23:52,941 --> 01:23:55,136
You are a natural

954
01:23:55,210 --> 01:23:57,440
Why is that so hard to see?

955
01:23:57,545 --> 01:24:01,675
Maybe it's just because
You keep on looking at me

956
01:24:01,716 --> 01:24:05,812
The journey's a lonely one
So much more than we know

957
01:24:05,887 --> 01:24:09,789
But sometimes you've got to go
And be your own hero

958
01:24:09,858 --> 01:24:12,793
Everybody is kung fu fighting

959
01:24:14,162 --> 01:24:17,359
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

960
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:21,801
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

961
01:24:22,904 --> 01:24:26,135
It's the book of your life
that you're writing

962
01:24:27,809 --> 01:24:32,109
You're a diamond in the rough
A brilliant ball of clay

963
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:36,276
You could be a work of art
If you just go all the way

964
01:24:36,351 --> 01:24:40,151
Now what would it take to break?
I believe that you can bend

965
01:24:40,221 --> 01:24:44,590
Not only do you have to fight
But you have got to win

966
01:24:44,659 --> 01:24:47,787
'Cause everybody is kung fu fighting

967
01:24:49,097 --> 01:24:52,123
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

968
01:24:53,334 --> 01:24:56,462
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

969
01:24:57,839 --> 01:25:00,967
It's the book of your life
that you're writing

970
01:25:02,777 --> 01:25:06,372
You're a diamond in the rough
A brilliant ball of clay

971
01:25:07,115 --> 01:25:11,575
You could be a work of art

973
01:25:15,757 --> 01:25:19,523

974
