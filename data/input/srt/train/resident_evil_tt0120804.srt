1
00:00:17,901 --> 00:00:21,234
At the beginning of the 21st century,
the Umbrella Corporation...

2
00:00:21,305 --> 00:00:24,763
had become the largest commercial
entity in the United States.

3
00:00:24,842 --> 00:00:27,834
Nine out of every ten homes
contain its products.

4
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:31,904
Its political and financial
influence is felt everywhere.

5
00:00:31,982 --> 00:00:34,849
In public, it is the world's
leading supplier...

6
00:00:34,918 --> 00:00:38,786
of computer technology,
medical products and health care.

7
00:00:38,856 --> 00:00:41,017
Unknown even to its own employees...

8
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:44,618
its massive profits are generated
by military technology...

9
00:00:44,695 --> 00:00:47,892
genetic experimentation
and viral weaponry.

10
00:02:34,706 --> 00:02:39,609
All Umbrella staff must wear
their identity tags at all times.

11
00:02:40,712 --> 00:02:45,513
All radiation badges will be collected
at 5:00 p.m. this afternoon.

12
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,518
Thank you! God!

13
00:02:50,822 --> 00:02:52,289
Some people.

14
00:02:52,357 --> 00:02:54,518
Yeah.

15
00:03:23,554 --> 00:03:25,317
- Don't show this to me.
- Why not?

16
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,153
Because I'm busy.

17
00:03:33,564 --> 00:03:36,260
It's nothing. Fire drill.

18
00:03:45,944 --> 00:03:49,402
- What is that?
- Fire drill.

19
00:03:53,451 --> 00:03:55,476
- Shit!
- Hey, what the hell is going on?

20
00:03:55,553 --> 00:03:58,215
- Get the computers covered! Move it!
- Damn it, I'm trying!

21
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:00,257
The experiments! Move them!

22
00:04:09,334 --> 00:04:12,929
Shouldn't the doors
open or something?

23
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:16,235
It's supposed to take us
to the nearest floor.

24
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,311
What's happening?

25
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:30,383
Line's dead.

26
00:04:33,724 --> 00:04:35,817
- What's the problem?
- The doors won't open.

27
00:04:35,892 --> 00:04:38,690
- What about the ones at the back?
- Locked as well.

28
00:04:38,762 --> 00:04:41,629
There's no fire here!
No fire!

29
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:46,068
- The code doesn't work!
- No fire!

30
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:48,434
- What's wrong with you?
- The door won't open!

31
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:49,972
And this water
isn't going anywhere.

32
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,474
- What?
- It's a sealed room.

33
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,705
- Help me with the door!
- Oh, fuck the doors!

34
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:08,154
We have to get out of here.
What's going on?

35
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:11,626
Has this happened before?
We have to get out of here.

36
00:05:11,695 --> 00:05:13,424
- We have to get out of here!
- Take it easy.

37
00:05:13,497 --> 00:05:15,624
- You take it easy!
- Quiet!

38
00:05:19,703 --> 00:05:21,295
What is that?

39
00:05:36,186 --> 00:05:37,983
Oh, my God.

40
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:09,951
Halon!

41
00:06:14,524 --> 00:06:16,424
Stop it!

42
00:06:17,227 --> 00:06:19,718
Stop it! Stop!

43
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:24,227
Help!

44
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,728
Let me see.

45
00:07:02,906 --> 00:07:06,740
We're gonna have to get out of here.
We have to get out of this building!

46
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,243
Here, give me a hand.

47
00:07:10,046 --> 00:07:13,174
That's as far as they'll go.
They're caught on something.

48
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,311
That's wide enough.
I can squeeze through. I'll get help.

49
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:26,891
I'm stuck.
You're gonna have to push.

50
00:07:27,964 --> 00:07:29,431
That's it.

51
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:30,761
A bit more.

52
00:07:32,936 --> 00:07:34,096
What was that?

53
00:07:35,672 --> 00:07:39,403
Oh, Christ!
It's the brakes! Get out!

54
00:07:39,476 --> 00:07:41,876
- I can't move!
- We have to get out of here!

55
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,951
Push her out of the way!

56
00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:53,751
Pull me back inside!

57
00:07:54,491 --> 00:07:55,924
Pull me back inside!

58
00:11:26,403 --> 00:11:27,768
Hello?

59
00:12:45,648 --> 00:12:47,275
- Who are you?
- Move!

60
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,840
Don't touch me! Stop!

61
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:50,385
- Get away from me!
- Down!

62
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,857
What are you doing?
I'm a cop!

63
00:13:06,169 --> 00:13:08,194
I told you, I'm a cop!

64
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,310
You're breaking my arm!

65
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:24,785
Report.

66
00:13:28,358 --> 00:13:30,087
Report now.

67
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:31,717
What?

68
00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:35,063
I want your report, soldier.

69
00:13:35,131 --> 00:13:37,156
I don't know
what you're talking about.

70
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,669
Sir, the house's primary
defenses have been activated.

71
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,331
She's probably still suffering
the side effects.

72
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:44,805
What are you doing with us?

73
00:13:44,874 --> 00:13:46,671
What about the cop?

74
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:50,144
Matthew Addison.
I'm not getting a match.

75
00:13:50,213 --> 00:13:51,771
Who are you?

76
00:13:51,848 --> 00:13:55,079
I just transferred. They probably
don't even have me on file yet.

77
00:13:55,151 --> 00:13:57,176
The locals are inefficient.
It's possible.

78
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,448
Should I secure him here?

79
00:14:03,493 --> 00:14:05,757
No. We take him with us.

80
00:14:07,564 --> 00:14:09,498
You can't do this!

81
00:14:12,502 --> 00:14:13,662
Blow me.

82
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:17,835
Prep for entry to the Hive.

83
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,237
Power's down.

84
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,778
- So fix it.
- I'm on it.

85
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,495
Are you done yet?

86
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:29,663
Jumpy.

87
00:16:41,884 --> 00:16:43,818
Stand clear!

88
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:16,144
- You got a problem?
- How's that door?

89
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,518
- It's sealed shut.
- Let me.

90
00:17:34,071 --> 00:17:35,003
Jumpy?

91
00:18:07,404 --> 00:18:11,397
Lie still. Lie still!

92
00:18:11,475 --> 00:18:15,434
Watch this light.
Follow it.

93
00:18:18,282 --> 00:18:21,012
- Now, how many fingers am I holding up?
- Three.

94
00:18:21,084 --> 00:18:22,176
Good.

95
00:18:22,252 --> 00:18:24,186
Now tell me your name.

96
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:31,324
I don't know.

97
00:18:31,395 --> 00:18:35,161
He's fine. Memory loss,
just like the other one.

98
00:19:15,205 --> 00:19:17,196
Let's open that door.

99
00:19:39,062 --> 00:19:41,360
Listen to me. I want to know
who you people are...

100
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,797
and I want to know
what's going on here.

101
00:19:45,903 --> 00:19:47,165
Now!

102
00:19:49,506 --> 00:19:51,440
You and I have the same employer.

103
00:19:51,508 --> 00:19:53,601
We all work
for the Umbrella Corporation.

104
00:19:53,677 --> 00:19:56,976
The mansion above us
is an emergency entrance to the Hive.

105
00:19:57,047 --> 00:20:01,313
You are security operatives
placed there to protect that entrance.

106
00:20:01,385 --> 00:20:02,977
What about this?

107
00:20:03,921 --> 00:20:05,821
Your marriage is a fake.

108
00:20:05,889 --> 00:20:09,222
Just part of your cover
to protect the secrecy of the Hive.

109
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:11,284
And what is the Hive?

110
00:20:11,361 --> 00:20:12,885
Show them.

111
00:20:14,898 --> 00:20:15,032
Accessing schematic of the Hive.

112
00:20:15,032 --> 00:20:17,227
Accessing schematic of the Hive.

113
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:19,861
Raccoon City, nearest urban center.

114
00:20:19,937 --> 00:20:21,871
The mansion where we found you...

115
00:20:21,939 --> 00:20:24,464
and through which we gained
access to the train...

116
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,510
which, in turn,
brought us to the Hive.

117
00:20:29,112 --> 00:20:31,945
The Hive itself
is located underground...

118
00:20:32,015 --> 00:20:34,882
deep beneath the streets
of Raccoon City.

119
00:20:36,586 --> 00:20:38,520
A top-secret research facility...

120
00:20:38,588 --> 00:20:41,182
owned and operated
by the Umbrella Corporation...

121
00:20:41,258 --> 00:20:46,093
the Hive houses over 500 technicians,
scientists and support staff.

122
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:49,189
They live and work underground.

123
00:20:49,266 --> 00:20:51,996
Their research
is of the highest importance.

124
00:20:52,069 --> 00:20:54,230
Its nature is classified.

125
00:20:55,605 --> 00:20:59,006
Our position on the map
is indicated by heat signature.

126
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:15,383
Why can't I remember anything?

127
00:21:15,459 --> 00:21:17,427
The Hive has its own
defense mechanisms...

128
00:21:17,494 --> 00:21:19,257
all computer-controlled.

129
00:21:20,497 --> 00:21:22,965
A nerve gas was released
into the house.

130
00:21:26,636 --> 00:21:28,536
Primary effect of the gas--

131
00:21:28,605 --> 00:21:31,574
complete unconsciousness
lasting anything up to four hours.

132
00:21:31,641 --> 00:21:35,270
Secondary effects are varied,
but can include acute memory loss.

133
00:21:35,345 --> 00:21:37,279
- For how long?
- Subjective.

134
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:39,212
An hour, day, week.

135
00:21:39,282 --> 00:21:41,648
So you're saying
this place was attacked?

136
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:45,017
I'm afraid things are
a little more complicated than that.

137
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:49,152
Sir! We've breached the Hive.

138
00:21:59,136 --> 00:22:00,865
J.D.

139
00:22:28,331 --> 00:22:29,525
Got it.

140
00:22:42,145 --> 00:22:44,170
Halon content has dissipated.

141
00:23:03,366 --> 00:23:07,063
Makes it easier to work underground,
thinking there's a view.

142
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:30,652
Looks like we're taking the stairs.

143
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:43,938
- Status.
- Red Queen is locked onto us.

144
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:45,941
She knows that we're here.

145
00:23:47,444 --> 00:23:48,877
Who's the Red Queen?

146
00:23:48,945 --> 00:23:50,879
State-of-the-art
artificial intelligence.

147
00:23:50,947 --> 00:23:53,814
She is the computer
that controls the Hive.

148
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:10,398
This is gonna slow us down.

149
00:24:10,467 --> 00:24:13,903
Our route to the Queen
takes us straight through these labs.

150
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:17,269
Rain, J.D., see how bad
the flooding is.

151
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,740
Kaplan, find us
an alternate route.

152
00:24:22,979 --> 00:24:24,207
What happened here?

153
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:31,353
Five hours ago,
Red Queen went homicidal.

154
00:24:31,421 --> 00:24:33,389
Sealed the Hive
and killed everyone down here.

155
00:24:33,456 --> 00:24:35,720
-Jesus.
- When we realized what was happening...

156
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:38,056
my team was dispatched
to shut her down.

157
00:24:38,128 --> 00:24:39,459
Why did she do it?

158
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:42,089
That we don't know.

159
00:24:42,165 --> 00:24:45,328
But outside interference
is a possibility.

160
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:46,733
Jesus!

161
00:25:00,817 --> 00:25:03,513
Hey. You okay?

162
00:25:08,158 --> 00:25:09,648
- Here.
- No.

163
00:25:09,726 --> 00:25:11,159
- I'm fine.
- Please, come on.

164
00:25:11,228 --> 00:25:12,593
It's cold in here.

165
00:25:21,671 --> 00:25:23,002
Are you--

166
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:31,013
Do you remember anything
from before this?

167
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:37,215
No. Nothing before the train.

168
00:25:39,189 --> 00:25:40,918
And you?

169
00:25:42,325 --> 00:25:45,226
No. Nothing.

170
00:25:46,363 --> 00:25:49,230
I found an alternate route,
but it's gonna cost us time.

171
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:52,894
We double back,
cut through Dining Hall B...

172
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:54,766
then we're right on track.

173
00:26:09,753 --> 00:26:13,052
Sir, no go.
The whole level's flooded.

174
00:26:13,123 --> 00:26:15,717
All right,
we're behind schedule.

175
00:26:15,792 --> 00:26:17,885
So let's move it.

176
00:26:23,466 --> 00:26:24,899
Come on.

177
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:33,775
Poor bastards.

178
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:22,922
Dining Hall B.

179
00:27:22,992 --> 00:27:25,426
That's what it says on the map.

180
00:27:25,495 --> 00:27:27,690
Maybe you're reading it wrong.

181
00:27:27,764 --> 00:27:31,325
Maybe the corporation's
keeping a few secrets down here.

182
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:33,028
Something you're
not supposed to see.

183
00:27:34,137 --> 00:27:37,436
J.D., you and Rain keep the prisoner
here and secure the exit.

184
00:27:37,507 --> 00:27:40,408
Sir, halon levels
are nonexistent in this room.

185
00:27:40,477 --> 00:27:42,911
I think the system malfunctioned.

186
00:27:42,979 --> 00:27:45,447
All right.
There may be survivors.

187
00:27:45,515 --> 00:27:47,506
Give me a search line,
but keep it tight.

188
00:27:51,388 --> 00:27:52,821
Move it.

189
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:47,500
- I said keep it tight.
- Sorry.

190
00:28:49,712 --> 00:28:53,045
I'm not sure I want to remember
what went on down here.

191
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,720
I don't blame you.

192
00:28:58,788 --> 00:29:01,723
What do they keep in these things?

193
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:04,089
How do I know?

194
00:29:28,918 --> 00:29:30,613
What's taking so long?

195
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:35,124
Red Queen's defenses are in place.
She's making it difficult.

196
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:40,726
Let's pack it up.

197
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,407
You stay here.

198
00:30:28,678 --> 00:30:31,977
The lights are automated.
Nothing to worry about.

199
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:53,694
- Transmitter in position.
- Roger.

200
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,863
Running the bypass.

201
00:31:15,258 --> 00:31:17,158
Checkmate.

202
00:31:26,035 --> 00:31:27,161
Move up.

203
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:36,235
- What is that?
- That's what will shut the Queen down.

204
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:38,246
Delivers a massive
electrical charge.

205
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:40,407
Scrambles the mainframe
and forces it to reboot.

206
00:31:50,193 --> 00:31:53,162
Some kind of dormant
defense mechanism.

207
00:31:53,229 --> 00:31:54,924
- Opening the door tripped it.
- Put it back to sleep.

208
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:56,260
Working on it.

209
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:02,395
- Would you open that door now, please?
- I'm trying.

210
00:32:02,472 --> 00:32:05,464
Hold your positions.
Everyone stay calm.

211
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:06,974
What's that?

212
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:10,335
- Kaplan, quick!
- We gotta get them out of there!

213
00:32:10,413 --> 00:32:12,779
- Kaplan, you've gotta hurry!
- Come on!

214
00:32:13,783 --> 00:32:15,341
Down! Get down!

215
00:32:16,819 --> 00:32:19,845
- Look out! Something's killing them!
-Jesus! Come on, man.

216
00:32:19,922 --> 00:32:21,287
Don't do this to me!

217
00:32:22,592 --> 00:32:24,457
Medic! Medic!

218
00:32:33,503 --> 00:32:35,266
- Open the door!
- Open this door!

219
00:32:35,338 --> 00:32:37,568
- I am trying.
- Stay conscious.

220
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,631
You're going into shock.
Stay awake!

221
00:32:40,476 --> 00:32:43,604
- I am almost there.
- Sir! It's coming back!

222
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,272
- Open the door!
- I'm trying!

223
00:32:45,348 --> 00:32:46,542
Well, try harder!

224
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,481
It's coming back!

225
00:32:57,794 --> 00:32:59,659
Oh, God!

226
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:02,197
-Just do it!
- I'm almost there.

227
00:33:02,265 --> 00:33:03,823
Come on!

228
00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:07,693
- Shit!
- Got it.

229
00:33:33,129 --> 00:33:34,960
All right.

230
00:33:35,031 --> 00:33:36,464
Let's do it.

231
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,194
Do what?

232
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:41,532
We have to complete the mission.

233
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:43,595
There is no way
I'm going down there.

234
00:33:44,974 --> 00:33:47,067
Her defenses are down.

235
00:33:47,143 --> 00:33:49,077
Déjà vu, anyone?

236
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,773
Keep going.

237
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:28,968
Give me a hand.

238
00:35:43,826 --> 00:35:46,761
Get out! Get out!
You can't be in here.

239
00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:48,626
Don't listen
to anything she says.

240
00:35:48,698 --> 00:35:50,928
She's a holographic
representation of the Red Queen.

241
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,558
You have to get out!

242
00:35:52,635 --> 00:35:54,796
Modeled after
the head programmer's daughter.

243
00:35:54,871 --> 00:35:57,066
She'll try to deceive us,
confuse us.

244
00:35:57,139 --> 00:36:01,667
I wouldn't advise this. Disabling me
will result in loss of primary power.

245
00:36:01,744 --> 00:36:04,941
She'll say anything to stop us
from shutting her down.

246
00:36:05,014 --> 00:36:07,278
I implore you.

247
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:10,911
- Implore away.
- Please?

248
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:14,146
Please?

249
00:36:15,191 --> 00:36:18,126
You're all going to die down here.

250
00:37:18,454 --> 00:37:22,322
That pulse forces the circuit breaker to
shut down her mainframe for 30 seconds.

251
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:25,525
After that, if I don't have
her board, she can reboot.

252
00:37:35,471 --> 00:37:37,234
They're late.

253
00:37:46,048 --> 00:37:47,515
I'm on it.

254
00:38:35,197 --> 00:38:37,927
J.D., we got a survivor!

255
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,127
It's okay.
We're here to help.

256
00:38:42,204 --> 00:38:44,172
You seem to be in some serious--

257
00:38:47,877 --> 00:38:50,778
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

258
00:38:52,615 --> 00:38:54,947
J.D., get her off of me
before I stab her ass!

259
00:38:58,554 --> 00:39:00,351
Are you okay?

260
00:39:00,423 --> 00:39:04,689
She bit me, man.
She took a chunk clean right out of me.

261
00:39:06,328 --> 00:39:07,761
Stay down.

262
00:39:08,764 --> 00:39:10,459
I'm warning you, stay down!

263
00:39:10,533 --> 00:39:11,591
She's crazy.

264
00:39:14,537 --> 00:39:16,095
Come any closer, and I'll fire.

265
00:39:18,007 --> 00:39:19,440
I mean it!

266
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:22,704
Damn you.

267
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:46,799
I shot her five times.
How was she still standing?

268
00:39:46,869 --> 00:39:48,894
Bitch isn't standing now.

269
00:39:53,576 --> 00:39:57,376
- What was all the shooting?
- We found a survivor.

270
00:39:57,446 --> 00:40:01,746
- And you shot him?
- She was crazed. She bit me.

271
00:40:03,085 --> 00:40:05,519
She's gone. She's gone!

272
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:08,286
That's bullshit!

273
00:40:08,357 --> 00:40:11,087
She fell right here,
but she's gone!

274
00:40:13,028 --> 00:40:14,962
Look, look at this.

275
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:17,498
There's blood,
but it's not much.

276
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:21,231
Looks like it's coagulated.

277
00:40:22,638 --> 00:40:25,232
- Yeah.
- It's not possible.

278
00:40:25,307 --> 00:40:26,433
Why not?

279
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:31,611
Because blood doesn't do that
till after you're dead.

280
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,443
Can we go now?

281
00:40:33,516 --> 00:40:36,952
We're not going anywhere
till the rest of the team get here.

282
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:45,784
- There's no one else coming.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

283
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:47,294
Wait.

284
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:50,297
Quiet.

285
00:41:25,334 --> 00:41:26,892
Fuck!

286
00:41:26,969 --> 00:41:29,631
Don't come any closer!
They're behind us.

287
00:41:29,705 --> 00:41:32,037
Jesus!

288
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:35,137
They're everywhere.

289
00:41:35,778 --> 00:41:38,178
They're everywhere.
They're all around us.

290
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,238
I said stay back!

291
00:42:12,248 --> 00:42:14,216
Why aren't they dying?

292
00:42:22,725 --> 00:42:25,819
Watch the tank! The tank!

293
00:42:33,269 --> 00:42:35,237
- Let's go!
- Hurry up!

294
00:42:35,304 --> 00:42:37,033
- Wait!
- Come on, let's go!

295
00:42:37,106 --> 00:42:38,903
- Move!
- Keep moving! Come on!

296
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:45,044
Move!

297
00:42:57,493 --> 00:42:59,256
I can help you get the virus.

298
00:42:59,328 --> 00:43:03,321
I have access to security codes,
surveillance plans, the works.

299
00:43:21,317 --> 00:43:23,080
Shit!

300
00:43:29,858 --> 00:43:32,452
- We lost the others!
- Keep moving!

301
00:43:41,236 --> 00:43:43,534
- You waited?
- Didn't know the code.

302
00:43:43,605 --> 00:43:45,368
Come on, come on.

303
00:43:45,441 --> 00:43:47,136
- Shit!
- Come on.

304
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:02,721
- Come on.
- Hurry up.

305
00:44:02,791 --> 00:44:04,554
- Come on, man.
- Shit!

306
00:44:06,061 --> 00:44:07,995
- What's taking so long?
- I'm trying!

307
00:44:25,681 --> 00:44:26,739
Come on.

308
00:44:29,651 --> 00:44:31,642
- Move! What's the code?
- Hurry up!

309
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,312
I'm running out of ammo!

310
00:44:33,389 --> 00:44:36,085
Zero, four, three, two--
No, five!

311
00:44:36,158 --> 00:44:38,956
- What?
- Zero, four, three--

312
00:44:39,027 --> 00:44:41,154
- What is the code?
- Zero, four...

313
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:43,790
zero, three, one...

314
00:44:43,866 --> 00:44:45,800
nine, six, five.

315
00:44:46,535 --> 00:44:49,561
- Got it?
- See how easy that was?

316
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:52,306
- Shit!
-J.D., no!

317
00:44:55,711 --> 00:44:57,872
Grab my hand, man!
Come on!

318
00:44:57,946 --> 00:45:00,107
Don't let go!

319
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:11,386
-J.D.!
- Rain!

320
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:03,301
Where are the bodies?
Where did they go?

321
00:46:03,378 --> 00:46:04,310
Fuck!

322
00:46:07,649 --> 00:46:10,083
Whatever they are,
there's too many of them out there.

323
00:46:10,152 --> 00:46:14,054
Whatever they are?
It's pretty obvious what they are.

324
00:46:14,122 --> 00:46:17,717
Lab coats, badges.
Those people used to work here!

325
00:46:17,793 --> 00:46:20,227
All the people working here
are dead.

326
00:46:20,295 --> 00:46:23,264
Well, that isn't stopping them
from walking around.

327
00:46:23,332 --> 00:46:26,893
Well, where did they come from?
Why didn't we see them on the way in?

328
00:46:26,969 --> 00:46:29,665
When you cut the power,
you unlocked the doors.

329
00:46:29,738 --> 00:46:31,137
You let them out.

330
00:46:41,383 --> 00:46:43,874
We're never gonna make it
to the surface.

331
00:48:45,107 --> 00:48:47,200
You are security operatives.

332
00:48:47,275 --> 00:48:50,244
Security operatives placed there
to protect that entrance.

333
00:51:46,021 --> 00:51:49,684
I've got one in the breech
and an extra mag.

334
00:52:16,184 --> 00:52:17,412
Lisa?

335
00:52:44,846 --> 00:52:46,905
I can help you get the virus.

336
00:52:46,982 --> 00:52:51,180
I have access to security codes,
surveillance plans, the works.

337
00:52:51,253 --> 00:52:52,982
But?

338
00:52:53,054 --> 00:52:55,113
- But there's gonna be a price.
- Name it.

339
00:53:02,931 --> 00:53:05,991
- Who was she?
- My sister.

340
00:53:14,042 --> 00:53:18,376
Corporations like Umbrella
think they're above the law.

341
00:53:20,015 --> 00:53:21,949
But they're not.

342
00:53:25,553 --> 00:53:28,784
There are hundreds of thousands
of us who think the same...

343
00:53:28,857 --> 00:53:30,791
all over the world.

344
00:53:33,795 --> 00:53:36,320
Some of us provide information...

345
00:53:37,232 --> 00:53:40,224
others give their support.

346
00:53:40,302 --> 00:53:43,669
Some take more direct action.

347
00:53:43,738 --> 00:53:45,399
Like you.

348
00:53:47,375 --> 00:53:49,434
If your friends had been
a little more thorough...

349
00:53:49,511 --> 00:53:52,071
they would've seen
right through my false ID.

350
00:53:54,649 --> 00:53:56,879
Then all the red flags
would've gone off--

351
00:53:56,952 --> 00:54:01,013
Quantico, NSA, ViCAP,
all the rest.

352
00:54:02,257 --> 00:54:05,351
There's no way
I could've infiltrated the Hive.

353
00:54:06,728 --> 00:54:08,662
So you sent your sister.

354
00:54:12,834 --> 00:54:15,029
We needed something concrete.

355
00:54:15,103 --> 00:54:18,004
Anything to expose Umbrella
to the press.

356
00:54:18,073 --> 00:54:21,042
Proof of the research
that was going on down here.

357
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:23,778
What kind of research?

358
00:54:23,845 --> 00:54:25,676
The illegal kind.

359
00:54:27,315 --> 00:54:28,543
Genetic.

360
00:54:29,851 --> 00:54:31,409
Viral.

361
00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:36,719
My sister was going to smuggle out...

362
00:54:36,791 --> 00:54:39,555
a sample of the virus
they were developing.

363
00:54:42,831 --> 00:54:45,356
So how was she
going to make it out of here?

364
00:54:45,433 --> 00:54:50,200
She had a contact within the Hive,
someone I never met.

365
00:54:50,271 --> 00:54:55,265
They had access to security codes,
surveillance, everything she needed.

366
00:54:55,343 --> 00:54:57,641
So why didn't she make it?

367
00:54:59,647 --> 00:55:01,274
Maybe she trusted
the wrong person.

368
00:55:03,151 --> 00:55:05,449
Maybe they set her up.

369
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,988
Kept the virus for themselves.

370
00:55:09,824 --> 00:55:13,316
Do you know how much the T-virus
would be worth on the open market?

371
00:55:14,929 --> 00:55:18,092
- What, worth all this?
- Yeah.

372
00:55:18,166 --> 00:55:20,396
To someone.

373
00:55:27,642 --> 00:55:29,109
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

374
00:55:29,177 --> 00:55:32,476
- Close that door!
- They're right behind us!

375
00:55:35,216 --> 00:55:36,808
Get off!. Get off!.

376
00:55:36,885 --> 00:55:38,182
Stop it!

377
00:55:40,321 --> 00:55:42,653
Son of a bitch!

378
00:55:42,724 --> 00:55:45,693
- You okay?
- Yeah.

379
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,695
Right behind us.
What about this door?

380
00:55:48,763 --> 00:55:53,200
- They're waiting out there too.
- And that way?

381
00:55:53,268 --> 00:55:56,829
It's a dead end. There's no way
out of the Queen's chamber.

382
00:55:56,905 --> 00:55:58,133
So we wait.

383
00:55:58,206 --> 00:56:02,142
If someone doesn't hear from you,
they'll send backup or something.

384
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:03,302
Right?

385
00:56:06,915 --> 00:56:08,780
What? What's wrong?

386
00:56:10,185 --> 00:56:12,278
We don't have much time.

387
00:56:12,353 --> 00:56:14,344
You know those blast doors
we passed...

388
00:56:14,422 --> 00:56:16,390
on the way in from the mansion?

389
00:56:16,458 --> 00:56:18,392
They seal shut
in just under an hour.

390
00:56:19,494 --> 00:56:22,588
If we're not out of here by then,
we're not getting out.

391
00:56:22,664 --> 00:56:25,963
What are you talking about?
They can't just bury us alive down here.

392
00:56:30,071 --> 00:56:34,007
Containing the incident
is the only fail-safe plan they had...

393
00:56:35,276 --> 00:56:37,335
against possible contamination.

394
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:43,647
And you're only telling us this now,
when we're trapped...

395
00:56:43,718 --> 00:56:45,583
half a mile underground?

396
00:56:45,653 --> 00:56:48,383
We have to find a way
out of this room.

397
00:56:50,592 --> 00:56:51,684
What are you doing?

398
00:56:55,797 --> 00:56:58,732
- Where are you taking those?
- I'm turning her back on.

399
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,735
- That is not a good idea.
- She'll know a way out of here.

400
00:57:07,342 --> 00:57:09,037
That homicidal bitch
killed my team.

401
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:12,273
That homicidal bitch
may be our only way out of here.

402
00:57:12,347 --> 00:57:16,443
Considering the way she's being treated,
I'm sure she'll be happy to help us out.

403
00:57:16,518 --> 00:57:18,611
That circuit breaker
you were talking about.

404
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:20,210
- Can you bypass it?
- Yeah.

405
00:57:20,288 --> 00:57:21,721
So do it.

406
00:57:28,363 --> 00:57:30,729
All right,
circuit breaker is disabled.

407
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:34,359
This time if I hit the switch,
she won't be able to shut down.

408
00:57:34,435 --> 00:57:35,732
She's gonna fry.

409
00:57:39,374 --> 00:57:41,308
Kaplan?

410
00:57:41,376 --> 00:57:43,469
The initial charge
must have damaged her boards.

411
00:57:43,545 --> 00:57:45,035
Ah, there you are.

412
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:49,077
Things, I gather,
have gone out of control.

413
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:52,711
Give me that fucking switch right now.
I'm gonna fry your ass.

414
00:57:52,787 --> 00:57:54,948
I did warn you, didn't I?

415
00:57:55,023 --> 00:57:57,218
Tell us what's going on down here.

416
00:57:57,292 --> 00:57:59,351
Research and development.

417
00:57:59,427 --> 00:58:01,156
What about the T-virus?

418
00:58:01,229 --> 00:58:04,665
The T-virus was
a major medical breakthrough...

419
00:58:04,732 --> 00:58:10,227
although it clearly also possessed
highly profitable military applications.

420
00:58:10,305 --> 00:58:12,239
How does it explain
those things out there?

421
00:58:12,307 --> 00:58:15,470
Even in death, the human body
still remains active.

422
00:58:15,543 --> 00:58:17,477
Hair and fingernails
continue to grow.

423
00:58:18,213 --> 00:58:19,976
New cells are produced...

424
00:58:20,048 --> 00:58:23,074
and the brain itself
holds a small electrical charge...

425
00:58:23,151 --> 00:58:25,949
that takes months to dissipate.

426
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:28,580
The T-virus
provides a massive jolt...

427
00:58:28,656 --> 00:58:30,590
both to cellular growth...

428
00:58:30,658 --> 00:58:33,593
and to those trace
electrical impulses.

429
00:58:33,661 --> 00:58:35,561
Put quite simply...

430
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:38,098
it reanimates the body.

431
00:58:38,166 --> 00:58:40,464
It brings the dead back to life?

432
00:58:40,535 --> 00:58:42,093
Not fully.

433
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:45,833
The subjects have
the simplest of motor functions.

434
00:58:45,907 --> 00:58:49,604
Perhaps a little memory.
Virtually no intelligence.

435
00:58:49,677 --> 00:58:52,373
They are driven by
the basest of impulses...

436
00:58:52,447 --> 00:58:54,711
the most basic of needs.

437
00:58:54,782 --> 00:58:55,874
Which is?

438
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:57,713
The need to feed.

439
00:59:02,757 --> 00:59:04,281
How do you kill them?

440
00:59:04,359 --> 00:59:07,920
Severing the top of the spinal column
or massive trauma to the brain...

441
00:59:07,996 --> 00:59:10,931
are the most effective methods.

442
00:59:10,999 --> 00:59:13,695
You mean shoot them in the head.

443
00:59:13,768 --> 00:59:15,702
Why did you kill
everybody down here?

444
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:19,536
The T-virus escaped
into the air conditioning system...

445
00:59:19,607 --> 00:59:23,099
and an uncontrolled
pattern of infection began.

446
00:59:23,177 --> 00:59:24,974
The virus is protean...

447
00:59:25,046 --> 00:59:28,607
changing from liquid to airborne
to blood transmission...

448
00:59:28,683 --> 00:59:30,981
depending on its environment.

449
00:59:31,052 --> 00:59:33,577
It's almost impossible to kill.

450
00:59:33,655 --> 00:59:36,681
I couldn't allow it
to escape from the Hive...

451
00:59:36,758 --> 00:59:39,693
so I took steps.

452
00:59:40,461 --> 00:59:43,055
- Steps.
- You must understand.

453
00:59:43,131 --> 00:59:46,498
Those who become infected,
I can't allow you to leave.

454
00:59:46,567 --> 00:59:48,626
Whoa. We're not infected.

455
00:59:48,703 --> 00:59:53,640
Just one bite, one scratch
from these creatures is sufficient...

456
00:59:53,708 --> 00:59:57,269
and then you become one of them.

457
00:59:58,313 --> 01:00:02,613
A check of my systems indicates
my main drive circuit breaker...

458
01:00:02,684 --> 01:00:04,811
has been disabled.

459
01:00:04,886 --> 01:00:06,820
May I ask why?

460
01:00:06,888 --> 01:00:09,379
Insurance.
We need a way out of here.

461
01:00:09,457 --> 01:00:12,392
If you refuse to help at any time,
we flip the switch.

462
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:14,519
Understand?

463
01:00:24,972 --> 01:00:26,269
After you.

464
01:00:36,017 --> 01:00:37,985
What the hell is this place?

465
01:00:38,052 --> 01:00:39,349
The utility tunnels.

466
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:42,787
They run underneath the Hive
for water, gas and power lines.

467
01:00:56,037 --> 01:00:58,267
- It's been in here before.
- Keep moving.

468
01:00:58,339 --> 01:01:01,172
-We're going around in circles.
-This is the route the computer gave us.

469
01:01:01,242 --> 01:01:03,733
- Why are you listening to her?
- Enough already!

470
01:01:03,811 --> 01:01:07,406
We have no choice but to keep moving
'cause those things are right behind us.

471
01:01:14,188 --> 01:01:16,122
That mesh isn't gonna hold.
Keep moving.

472
01:01:20,094 --> 01:01:22,995
Jesus Christ! Hold it!
There's too many of them!

473
01:01:25,967 --> 01:01:27,127
-Jesus!
- Fuck!

474
01:01:40,681 --> 01:01:43,241
Up on the pipes.
Up on the pipes!

475
01:01:44,352 --> 01:01:45,512
Quickly, everyone!

476
01:01:46,721 --> 01:01:48,655
- Let's go!
- Come on! There's a way up!

477
01:01:48,723 --> 01:01:50,350
Watch out! Keep 'em back!

478
01:01:52,226 --> 01:01:54,194
Go on up! Move it!

479
01:01:58,466 --> 01:01:59,865
Shit. Okay.

480
01:02:09,444 --> 01:02:14,006
Get over here! There's too many of them!
Come on! Go, go, go!

481
01:02:14,081 --> 01:02:15,275
Go on!

482
01:02:16,317 --> 01:02:18,410
Go! Go! I can manage!

483
01:02:22,457 --> 01:02:23,549
Gotcha!

484
01:03:01,429 --> 01:03:03,294
Rain?

485
01:03:03,364 --> 01:03:05,662
Rain.

486
01:03:05,733 --> 01:03:06,825
What?

487
01:03:06,901 --> 01:03:09,665
We have to do something
about your wounds.

488
01:03:10,738 --> 01:03:12,228
I'm fine.

489
01:03:13,941 --> 01:03:15,499
I said I'm fine.

490
01:03:22,683 --> 01:03:24,981
You like that, don't you?
Huh?

491
01:03:26,854 --> 01:03:29,254
You like the way it tastes,
don't you?

492
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:33,452
Like the taste of that?

493
01:03:41,202 --> 01:03:42,635
She was right.

494
01:03:45,973 --> 01:03:47,907
We're all gonna die down here.

495
01:03:47,975 --> 01:03:50,739
No. We're getting out.

496
01:03:50,811 --> 01:03:52,301
All of us.

497
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:38,484
Kaplan, are you okay?

498
01:04:54,642 --> 01:04:56,200
Oh, God!

499
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:08,017
Hold on!

500
01:05:19,834 --> 01:05:22,496
- Help him.
- I can't.

501
01:05:23,471 --> 01:05:25,837
- What are you waiting for?
- I can't focus!

502
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:30,902
I can't see!

503
01:05:36,817 --> 01:05:39,615
- Kaplan, go up!
- Get up there!

504
01:05:39,687 --> 01:05:42,053
You almost got it.
Keep going!

505
01:05:42,123 --> 01:05:44,785
- Come on! Come on!
- You can do it!

506
01:05:46,427 --> 01:05:47,860
You got it!

507
01:05:47,928 --> 01:05:50,522
- Okay, Kaplan.
-Just stay there!

508
01:05:50,598 --> 01:05:52,691
Hold on.
We're gonna come get you.

509
01:05:52,767 --> 01:05:56,601
Cut this wire and throw it to him.
Then we can go get him.

510
01:05:56,671 --> 01:05:58,104
Hold on!

511
01:06:04,045 --> 01:06:05,478
That's lucky.

512
01:06:08,616 --> 01:06:09,878
I want you to go.

513
01:06:15,456 --> 01:06:18,118
- We're not leaving you, Kaplan.
- Yes, you are.

514
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:22,427
You can't kill all of them.

515
01:06:22,496 --> 01:06:25,226
And I'm not going anywhere.

516
01:06:25,299 --> 01:06:28,029
I want you to go. Now!

517
01:06:28,102 --> 01:06:29,262
Please.

518
01:06:29,336 --> 01:06:31,236
Just do it.

519
01:06:32,873 --> 01:06:35,137
Just do it now!

520
01:06:35,209 --> 01:06:36,471
Please.

521
01:06:37,778 --> 01:06:39,177
Go!

522
01:07:07,007 --> 01:07:09,942
You're gonna have to work
for your meal!

523
01:07:41,575 --> 01:07:42,940
Come on.

524
01:07:51,986 --> 01:07:55,217
Give me your arm.
Up over my shoulder.

525
01:07:55,289 --> 01:07:57,723
Ready? There we go.

526
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:40,966
When I get out of here...

527
01:08:42,435 --> 01:08:44,460
I think I'm gonna get laid.

528
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:47,973
Yeah. You might want to
clean up a little bit first.

529
01:08:56,649 --> 01:08:58,082
Hey, wait.

530
01:09:03,623 --> 01:09:04,954
Are you okay?

531
01:09:51,871 --> 01:09:54,806
Blue for the virus.
Green for the antivirus.

532
01:09:59,712 --> 01:10:02,340
- There's a cure.
- What are you talking about?

533
01:10:03,082 --> 01:10:04,709
There's a cure.

534
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:08,151
The process can be reversed.

535
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:10,987
There's a cure!

536
01:10:11,057 --> 01:10:13,116
You're gonna be okay!

537
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,894
I was beginning to worry.

538
01:10:23,703 --> 01:10:26,137
This is where
they kept the T-virus.

539
01:10:27,874 --> 01:10:29,808
How do you know all this?

540
01:10:32,712 --> 01:10:34,646
Because I was gonna steal it.

541
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:39,684
I was your sister's contact.

542
01:10:42,055 --> 01:10:44,182
- You betrayed her.
- I don't know.

543
01:10:44,257 --> 01:10:47,192
- You caused all of this.
- I can't remember.

544
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:48,818
The truth.

545
01:10:48,895 --> 01:10:51,693
I don't remember the truth.

546
01:11:25,298 --> 01:11:26,731
I don't understand!

547
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:31,128
It's gone.

548
01:11:32,171 --> 01:11:33,604
It's not there.

549
01:11:35,441 --> 01:11:36,874
I can't.

550
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:39,306
I just can't.

551
01:11:39,379 --> 01:11:40,869
It's over.

552
01:11:49,522 --> 01:11:51,547
I can help you get the virus.

553
01:11:51,624 --> 01:11:55,185
I have access to security codes,
surveillance plans, the works.

554
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,621
But there's gonna be a price.

555
01:11:58,698 --> 01:12:00,723
Name it.

556
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:05,669
You have to guarantee me that
you will bring this corporation down.

557
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:25,784
Spence?

558
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:46,569
Thank you.

559
01:12:56,522 --> 01:12:57,511
Spence?

560
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:26,414
We can still make it out of here.
Come with me.

561
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:32,253
We can have everything
we've ever wanted.

562
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:34,225
Money's out there waiting.

563
01:13:34,961 --> 01:13:37,987
You wouldn't believe how much.

564
01:13:38,064 --> 01:13:41,659
Is that how you thought
all my dreams were gonna come true?

565
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:44,101
Please.

566
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:47,105
I wouldn't want to shoot you.

567
01:13:47,173 --> 01:13:49,767
Might need the bullets.

568
01:13:51,244 --> 01:13:53,439
Back off.

569
01:13:57,550 --> 01:13:59,814
I won't take any part in this.

570
01:13:59,886 --> 01:14:02,013
Okay, but you can't just...

571
01:14:02,755 --> 01:14:04,814
wash your hands of this.

572
01:14:04,891 --> 01:14:07,860
We work for the same company.
You knew what they did.

573
01:14:07,927 --> 01:14:10,623
I was trying to stop them.

574
01:14:12,098 --> 01:14:13,531
You really believe that...

575
01:14:15,101 --> 01:14:16,534
people like him...

576
01:14:16,602 --> 01:14:19,036
will ever change anything?

577
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:22,600
Nothing...

578
01:14:22,675 --> 01:14:25,508
ever changes.

579
01:14:27,446 --> 01:14:29,038
Where is...

580
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:31,649
the antivirus?

581
01:14:32,385 --> 01:14:33,784
It's on the train...

582
01:14:35,688 --> 01:14:37,417
where you found me.

583
01:14:38,691 --> 01:14:41,660
Couldn't have been standing
more than three feet from it.

584
01:14:42,962 --> 01:14:45,487
I so nearly made it out.

585
01:14:47,466 --> 01:14:52,836
Didn't realize that bitch of a computer
had defense systems outside the Hive.

586
01:14:54,507 --> 01:14:57,169
In or out?

587
01:14:57,243 --> 01:14:58,938
In...

588
01:14:59,011 --> 01:15:00,501
or out?

589
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:02,241
I don't know what we had...

590
01:15:03,482 --> 01:15:04,506
but it's over.

591
01:15:11,390 --> 01:15:12,584
Back...

592
01:15:15,328 --> 01:15:16,989
the fuck off.

593
01:15:28,341 --> 01:15:30,275
I'm missing you already.

594
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:41,980
Your boyfriend's a real asshole.

595
01:15:42,054 --> 01:15:42,188
He shot the locking mechanism out.

596
01:15:42,188 --> 01:15:44,520
He shot the locking mechanism out.

597
01:15:45,591 --> 01:15:49,322
I can't believe that son of a bitch
is gonna get away with this.

598
01:15:49,395 --> 01:15:51,192
I don't think so.

599
01:15:53,899 --> 01:15:56,959
I've been a bad, bad girl.

600
01:16:56,929 --> 01:16:57,953
Oh, my God.

601
01:17:13,813 --> 01:17:16,247
What the fuck is that?

602
01:17:16,315 --> 01:17:19,011
One of the Hive's
early experiments...

603
01:17:19,085 --> 01:17:23,112
produced by injecting the T-virus
directly into living tissue.

604
01:17:23,189 --> 01:17:26,124
The results were unstable.

605
01:17:26,192 --> 01:17:30,288
Now that it has fed on fresh DNA,
it will mutate...

606
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:40,266
becoming a stronger,
faster hunter.

607
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:42,432
Great.

608
01:17:43,509 --> 01:17:46,603
If you knew it was loose,
why didn't you warn us?

609
01:17:47,646 --> 01:17:50,706
'Cause she was saving it for us.

610
01:17:51,784 --> 01:17:52,910
Isn't that right?

611
01:17:52,985 --> 01:17:56,421
I didn't think any of you
would make it this far.

612
01:17:56,489 --> 01:17:57,979
Not without infection.

613
01:17:58,057 --> 01:18:01,652
Why didn't you tell us
about the antivirus?

614
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:03,695
This long after infection...

615
01:18:03,763 --> 01:18:06,095
there's no guarantee
it would work.

616
01:18:07,733 --> 01:18:11,430
But there's a chance, right?

617
01:18:11,504 --> 01:18:13,938
I don't deal in chance.

618
01:18:22,047 --> 01:18:23,309
Fuck it.

619
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:36,018
No pressure, guys.

620
01:18:36,095 --> 01:18:39,360
You require
the four-digit access code.

621
01:18:39,432 --> 01:18:44,495
I can give you the code,
but first you must do something for me.

622
01:18:44,570 --> 01:18:47,505
- What do you want?
- One of your group is infected.

623
01:18:47,573 --> 01:18:50,565
I require her life
for the code.

624
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:53,510
The antivirus
is right there on the platform.

625
01:18:53,579 --> 01:18:55,911
- It's right there!
- I'm sorry.

626
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:58,575
It's a risk I cannot take.

627
01:19:01,754 --> 01:19:02,846
She's right.

628
01:19:03,589 --> 01:19:04,647
It's the only way.

629
01:19:04,723 --> 01:19:06,816
You're gonna have to kill me.

630
01:19:10,429 --> 01:19:12,989
Otherwise we all die down here.

631
01:19:20,072 --> 01:19:21,596
The glass is reinforced...

632
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:23,869
but it won't hold forever.

633
01:19:28,214 --> 01:19:30,011
- Do it.
- No.

634
01:19:30,082 --> 01:19:31,572
- Get up.
-Just do it.

635
01:19:31,650 --> 01:19:33,743
- Rain, please get up.
- Do it!

636
01:19:33,819 --> 01:19:36,083
- You don't have long to decide.
- Get up, please.

637
01:19:36,155 --> 01:19:38,783
- You have no choice.
- Kill her.

638
01:19:38,858 --> 01:19:41,554
Kill her now.
You don't have any choice.

639
01:19:41,627 --> 01:19:44,391
-Just do it now!
- I can't!

640
01:19:44,463 --> 01:19:46,260
- Please.
- Do it.

641
01:19:46,332 --> 01:19:47,731
- Kill her.
-Just do it.

642
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:49,427
Kill her now!

643
01:19:52,605 --> 01:19:53,537
Kill her!

644
01:20:23,636 --> 01:20:26,833
The bitch wouldn't open the door,
so I had to fry her.

645
01:20:29,174 --> 01:20:30,141
Move.

646
01:20:38,984 --> 01:20:41,009
What the fuck was that?

647
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:43,020
It's a long story.

648
01:21:02,141 --> 01:21:03,574
Start it up.

649
01:21:04,643 --> 01:21:06,736
I'll get the virus.

650
01:21:42,214 --> 01:21:44,079
I'm missing you already.

651
01:21:49,788 --> 01:21:51,221
Okay, we're in business.

652
01:21:52,658 --> 01:21:53,750
Full power.

653
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:55,983
We're leaving!

654
01:22:12,978 --> 01:22:15,913
I don't want to be
one of those things...

655
01:22:18,717 --> 01:22:21,515
walking around
without a soul.

656
01:22:23,255 --> 01:22:25,348
You won't.

657
01:22:25,424 --> 01:22:27,358
When the time comes...

658
01:22:28,827 --> 01:22:31,022
you'll take care of it.

659
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:34,856
No one else is gonna die.

660
01:22:36,935 --> 01:22:38,197
Okay?

661
01:22:47,046 --> 01:22:48,479
Here.

662
01:23:52,044 --> 01:23:53,636
I'm not dead yet.

663
01:23:54,913 --> 01:23:57,313
I think I'll have that back.

664
01:24:00,753 --> 01:24:03,051
I could kiss you, you bitch.

665
01:24:07,359 --> 01:24:09,190
What's going on back there?

666
01:24:21,406 --> 01:24:25,536
- Get us the fuck out of here!
- Any faster, we'll come off the rails!

667
01:25:41,787 --> 01:25:43,755
Open the doors!

668
01:26:06,945 --> 01:26:08,640
Open the doors!

669
01:26:08,714 --> 01:26:10,079
Now!

670
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:57,514
I failed all of them.

671
01:28:00,192 --> 01:28:01,625
I failed.

672
01:28:03,462 --> 01:28:04,952
Listen to me.

673
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:07,624
There is nothing else
you could've done.

674
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:10,133
The corporation's guilty here,
not you.

675
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:12,693
And we finally have the proof.

676
01:28:12,771 --> 01:28:15,035
That way Umbrella can't get--

677
01:28:16,108 --> 01:28:17,541
get away with this.

678
01:28:21,346 --> 01:28:22,540
What is it?

679
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:27,775
You're infected,
but you're gonna be okay.

680
01:28:27,853 --> 01:28:29,252
I'm not losing you.

681
01:28:37,662 --> 01:28:38,993
Help!

682
01:28:39,064 --> 01:28:41,225
Help him.
What are you doing?

683
01:28:52,944 --> 01:28:54,241
Matt!

684
01:28:55,013 --> 01:28:56,981
He's mutating.

685
01:28:58,817 --> 01:29:01,684
I want him in the Nemesis Program.

686
01:29:05,157 --> 01:29:06,647
Get off!.

687
01:29:07,859 --> 01:29:09,121
What's happening?

688
01:29:14,833 --> 01:29:15,891
Matt!

689
01:29:34,553 --> 01:29:35,986
I want her quarantined.

690
01:29:36,054 --> 01:29:39,217
Close observation
and a full series of blood tests.

691
01:29:41,226 --> 01:29:43,717
Let's see if she's infected.

692
01:29:43,795 --> 01:29:46,229
Take her to
the Raccoon City facility.

693
01:29:47,332 --> 01:29:49,266
Then assemble the team.

694
01:29:49,334 --> 01:29:51,859
We're reopening the Hive.

695
01:29:51,937 --> 01:29:54,371
I want to know
what went on down there.

696
01:29:55,841 --> 01:29:57,809
Just do it.

697
01:31:09,181 --> 01:31:10,614
Who's in there?

698
01:31:13,451 --> 01:31:14,884
Let me out!

699
01:31:15,954 --> 01:31:17,387
Let me out!

700
01:31:18,723 --> 01:31:20,657
Who's in there?
