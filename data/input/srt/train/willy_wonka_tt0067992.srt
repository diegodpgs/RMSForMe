1
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,177
All right, what's it going to be?

2
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,778
A Triple Cream Cup for Christopher.

3
00:03:00,987 --> 00:03:03,449
A Squelchy Snorter for Otis.

4
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,847
A Sizzler for June Marie.
And listen!

5
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:09,351
- Wonka's got a new one today.
- What is it?

6
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:11,989
This one's a Scrumpdiddleumptious Bar.

7
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,190
Scrumpdiddleumptious Bar?
How does he do it?

8
00:03:15,394 --> 00:03:17,384
Do you ask a fish how it swims?

9
00:03:17,662 --> 00:03:19,789
Or a bird how it flies?

10
00:03:19,998 --> 00:03:21,022
No, you don't.

11
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:22,962
They were born to do it.

12
00:03:23,168 --> 00:03:26,000
Just like Willy Wonka was born
to be a candy man...

13
00:03:26,837 --> 00:03:28,896
...and you were born to be a Wonkerer.

14
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,366
Who can take the sunrise

15
00:03:32,576 --> 00:03:35,237
Sprinkle it with dew

16
00:03:36,246 --> 00:03:39,807
Cover it in chocolate
and a miracle or two

17
00:03:40,016 --> 00:03:41,677
The Candy Man!

18
00:03:43,085 --> 00:03:45,019
The Candy Man can

19
00:03:46,588 --> 00:03:49,489
'Cause he mixes it with love

20
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:52,090
And makes the world taste good

21
00:03:53,694 --> 00:03:56,891
Who can take a rainbow

22
00:03:57,098 --> 00:03:59,032
Wrap it in a sigh

23
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:04,162
Soak it in the sun
And make the strawberry-lemon pie

24
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:05,668
The Candy Man?

25
00:04:05,872 --> 00:04:07,533
The Candy Man!

26
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:10,271
The Candy Man can!

27
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:15,103
'Cause he mixes it with love
And makes the world...

28
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,541
...taste good

29
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,683
Willy Wonka makes

30
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,408
Everything he bakes

31
00:04:21,619 --> 00:04:25,020
Satisfying and delicious

32
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:28,089
Talk about your childhood wishes

33
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:31,784
You can even eat the dishes

34
00:04:42,405 --> 00:04:44,429
Who can take tomorrow

35
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,800
Dip it in a dream

36
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:50,640
Separate the sorrow
And collect up all the cream

37
00:04:50,912 --> 00:04:53,937
- The Candy Man
- Willy Wonka can

38
00:04:54,148 --> 00:04:56,810
The Candy Man can

39
00:04:58,085 --> 00:05:02,111
The Candy Man can
'Cause he mixes it with love

40
00:05:02,322 --> 00:05:06,019
And makes the world taste good

41
00:05:07,827 --> 00:05:09,623
And the world tastes good

42
00:05:10,996 --> 00:05:15,933
'Cause the Candy Man thinks it should

43
00:05:35,684 --> 00:05:36,742
Hi, Mr. Jopeck.

44
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:39,848
Come along, Charlie.
You're late.

45
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,416
It's payday, Mr. Jopeck.

46
00:05:43,624 --> 00:05:44,716
You're right.

47
00:05:45,526 --> 00:05:47,858
- There you are.
- Thanks.

48
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:50,620
Say hello to your Grandpa Joe.

49
00:06:33,903 --> 00:06:36,029
Up the airy mountain...

50
00:06:36,238 --> 00:06:38,468
...down the rushing glen.

51
00:06:38,673 --> 00:06:40,834
We dare not go a-hunting...

52
00:06:41,043 --> 00:06:41,907
...for fear...

53
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,077
...of little men.

54
00:06:44,345 --> 00:06:45,903
You see...

55
00:06:46,914 --> 00:06:48,677
...nobody ever goes in...

56
00:06:52,352 --> 00:06:54,411
...nobody ever comes out.

57
00:07:04,863 --> 00:07:06,330
Charlie's late.

58
00:07:06,532 --> 00:07:09,228
He works too hard for a little boy.

59
00:07:09,435 --> 00:07:11,561
He should have some time to play.

60
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:13,737
Not enough hours in the day.

61
00:07:13,938 --> 00:07:16,168
With you four bedridden for 20 years...

62
00:07:16,374 --> 00:07:19,240
...it takes work
to keep this family going.

63
00:07:19,443 --> 00:07:21,741
If only his father were alive.

64
00:07:21,945 --> 00:07:25,574
When I get my strength back,
I'll get out of bed to help him.

65
00:07:25,782 --> 00:07:28,944
In all the years
you've been saying that...

66
00:07:29,385 --> 00:07:32,218
...I've yet to see you
set foot on the floor.

67
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:36,050
Maybe if the floor wasn't so cold...

68
00:07:37,225 --> 00:07:38,692
Hi, everybody!

69
00:07:39,461 --> 00:07:42,123
Wake up, Charlie's home!

70
00:07:43,398 --> 00:07:44,694
Grandpa George.

71
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,061
Grandma Georgina.

72
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:49,926
Grandma Josephine.

73
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,135
Grandpa Joe!

74
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,641
Is this your supper, Grandpa?

75
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,707
It's yours, too.

76
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:02,607
I'm fed up with cabbage water.
It's not enough!

77
00:08:02,814 --> 00:08:03,940
It's all we have!

78
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:05,810
What are you saying?

79
00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:09,382
- How about this?
- Where did you get that?

80
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:12,715
What difference
does it make where? He got it.

81
00:08:13,257 --> 00:08:14,451
My first payday.

82
00:08:14,658 --> 00:08:17,456
Good for you.
We'll have a real banquet.

83
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:18,820
Mom?

84
00:08:19,162 --> 00:08:22,154
Here's what's left.
You keep it.

85
00:08:22,832 --> 00:08:24,459
Except for this.

86
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:27,328
From now on,
I'm paying for your tobacco.

87
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,969
No one's going to pay for it.
I'm giving it up.

88
00:08:32,808 --> 00:08:34,605
Dad, it's only one pipe a day.

89
00:08:34,943 --> 00:08:38,309
When bread looks like a banquet,
I've no right to tobacco.

90
00:08:38,513 --> 00:08:40,276
Go on, Grandpa.

91
00:08:40,681 --> 00:08:42,672
Please take it.

92
00:08:49,189 --> 00:08:52,818
After my paper route,
I was in front of Wonka's.

93
00:08:53,025 --> 00:08:55,289
There was this strange man there.

94
00:08:56,128 --> 00:08:57,823
I think he was a tinker.

95
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:01,431
He was standing behind me
looking up at the factory.

96
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:03,760
Just before he left he said...

97
00:09:03,968 --> 00:09:07,267
"Nobody ever goes in,
and nobody ever comes out. "

98
00:09:07,472 --> 00:09:09,497
And right he was, Charlie!

99
00:09:09,707 --> 00:09:12,334
Not since the tragic day
Willy Wonka locked it.

100
00:09:12,543 --> 00:09:13,635
Why did he?

101
00:09:13,877 --> 00:09:17,176
Because all the other chocolate makers
were sending spies...

102
00:09:17,381 --> 00:09:20,838
...dressed as workers to steal
Mr. Wonka's secret recipes.

103
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,986
Especially Slugworth.
That Slugworth was the worst!

104
00:09:25,555 --> 00:09:28,182
Finally, Mr. Wonka shouted,
"I'll be ruined!"

105
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:32,292
"Close the factory!"
And that's just what he did.

106
00:09:32,494 --> 00:09:36,054
He locked the gates
and vanished completely.

107
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,197
And then, suddenly,
about three years later...

108
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,960
...the most amazing thing happened.

109
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:44,796
The factory started again,
full blast!

110
00:09:45,004 --> 00:09:48,371
And more delicious candies
were coming out than ever.

111
00:09:48,575 --> 00:09:51,703
But the gates stayed locked.
So that no one...

112
00:09:51,911 --> 00:09:54,640
...not even Slugworth,
could steal them.

113
00:09:54,846 --> 00:09:58,873
But Grandpa, someone must be helping
Mr. Wonka work the factory.

114
00:09:59,084 --> 00:10:00,881
Thousands must be.

115
00:10:01,086 --> 00:10:02,052
But who?

116
00:10:02,253 --> 00:10:03,914
Who are they?

117
00:10:04,422 --> 00:10:07,516
That is the biggest mystery of them all.

118
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,889
- Charlie Bucket?
- Yes, Mr. Turkentine?

119
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,256
I need an assistant.
Give me a hand.

120
00:10:17,467 --> 00:10:19,331
We have nitric acid, glycerin...

121
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,662
...and a special mixture of my own.

122
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,668
Together it's dangerous stuff,
blows you up.

123
00:10:24,873 --> 00:10:28,899
But mixed together right,
as only I know how, what's it make?

124
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,509
- I don't know.
- Of course not!

125
00:10:30,712 --> 00:10:32,179
Because only I know.

126
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,907
If you knew, you'd be teaching me
instead of me teaching you.

127
00:10:36,117 --> 00:10:40,678
And for a student to teach his teacher
is presumptuous. Is that clear?

128
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:42,184
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

129
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:46,757
Mixed together in the right way,
these dangerous ingredients...

130
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,189
...make the finest wart remover.

131
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:52,190
The trick is to pour equal amounts.

132
00:10:52,431 --> 00:10:55,661
Charlie, you take
the nitric acid and glycerin...

133
00:10:55,867 --> 00:10:58,734
...and I'll take my special mixture.
Ready?

134
00:10:58,937 --> 00:11:01,098
Good lad. Pour.

135
00:11:03,274 --> 00:11:04,673
Did we do it wrong?

136
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,605
Certainly not.
This is for big warts.

137
00:11:08,445 --> 00:11:10,436
What's going on out there?

138
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:15,247
Come here! What's happening?

139
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:17,783
Willy Wonka's opening his factory!

140
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:19,180
Are you sure?

141
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:21,515
He's giving lots of chocolate away!

142
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,884
- Class dismissed!
- It's only for 5 people!

143
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,588
Class un-dismissed.

144
00:11:26,795 --> 00:11:29,695
He hid 5 Golden Tickets.
Whoever finds them wins the prize.

145
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:33,298
- Where'd he hide them?
- Inside 5 Wonka Bars, you must buy them.

146
00:11:34,135 --> 00:11:35,898
Class re-dismissed!

147
00:11:47,146 --> 00:11:49,205
Now, details of the announcement...

148
00:11:49,415 --> 00:11:51,940
...that has captured
the world's attention.

149
00:11:52,151 --> 00:11:54,778
Hidden among the billions
of Wonka Bars...

150
00:11:54,986 --> 00:11:56,886
...are 5 Gold Tickets.

151
00:11:57,088 --> 00:12:01,457
And to the 5 people who find them
will come the most fabulous prize.

152
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:03,956
A lifetime supply of chocolate.

153
00:12:04,161 --> 00:12:07,892
If this were not enough, each winner,
before receiving his prize...

154
00:12:08,098 --> 00:12:09,895
...will be personally escorted...

155
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,464
They're all crazy!

156
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:12,964
The man's a genius!

157
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:14,830
He'll sell a million bars.

158
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:18,633
Do you think I've got a chance
to find one?

159
00:12:18,841 --> 00:12:21,502
One?! I'm counting on you
to find all five!

160
00:12:21,776 --> 00:12:23,073
One's enough for me.

161
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:24,472
We have reports...

162
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:27,307
...the response is phenomenal!
Wonka Bars...

163
00:12:27,515 --> 00:12:29,311
...are disappearing...

164
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:31,746
...at a rate to boggle the mind.

165
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,419
It is incredible...

166
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,418
...the way Wonkamania
has descended upon the globe.

167
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:40,149
While the world searches,
we watch and wait, wondering...

168
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,989
...where it will lead,
and how long the spirit will hold up...

169
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:45,255
...under the strain.

170
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:49,594
I still have these dreams, Doctor,
And I still can't stop believing them.

171
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:51,666
I've told you, Mr. Hoffstedder...

172
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,667
...to believe in dreams
is a manifestation of insanity.

173
00:12:54,872 --> 00:12:57,705
The sooner you accept this,
the sooner you'll get well.

174
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:02,972
I dreamed the Archangel whispered into
my ear where to find a Golden Ticket.

175
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,345
What did he say?

176
00:13:05,548 --> 00:13:08,676
What difference does that make?
This was a dream.

177
00:13:08,885 --> 00:13:11,978
- You said...
- Shut up and tell me where's the ticket!

178
00:13:12,321 --> 00:13:14,289
We begin with 5 Golden Tickets.

179
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:19,120
Like 5 lucky bolts of lightning
ready to strike at any point on the map.

180
00:13:19,328 --> 00:13:22,194
No one knew where or when
the first one would hit.

181
00:13:22,397 --> 00:13:24,865
But last night we got our answer.

182
00:13:25,066 --> 00:13:28,365
While America slept,
the first Golden Ticket was found...

183
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:31,628
...in the small town of
Duselheim, Germany.

184
00:13:31,838 --> 00:13:36,332
We've been waiting for the story,
and we're ready with a live report.

185
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,876
Proud we are,
for the attention of the world...

186
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,206
...focuses today here in Duselheim.

187
00:13:42,415 --> 00:13:44,883
A community thrust into prominence...

188
00:13:45,084 --> 00:13:48,712
...by the discovery of
the first Wonka Golden Ticket.

189
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,889
Its finder is the son
of a prominent butcher.

190
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,785
The boys name, Augustus Gloop!

191
00:13:56,427 --> 00:14:00,056
The pride of Duselheim,
the fame of Western Germany.

192
00:14:00,264 --> 00:14:03,062
An example for the whole world.

193
00:14:03,266 --> 00:14:06,235
How does it feel to be
the first Golden Ticket finder?

194
00:14:06,436 --> 00:14:08,063
- Hungry.
- Any other feelings?

195
00:14:08,271 --> 00:14:11,263
Sorry for Wonka.
It'll cost him a fortune in fudge.

196
00:14:11,707 --> 00:14:13,867
Mr. Gloop, would you mind...

197
00:14:14,543 --> 00:14:18,001
Mrs. Gloop, would you say
a few words to the audience?

198
00:14:18,213 --> 00:14:22,080
I knew he would find a Golden Ticket.
Eating is his hobby.

199
00:14:22,283 --> 00:14:25,946
He wouldn't do it unless
he needed the nourishment.

200
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:30,947
Happy birthday, Charlie!

201
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,256
Here you are, Charlie.

202
00:14:34,461 --> 00:14:35,894
Thank you.

203
00:14:42,634 --> 00:14:43,601
It's terrific!

204
00:14:43,802 --> 00:14:47,032
We each knitted, Grandmas
Georgina, Josephine and me.

205
00:14:47,238 --> 00:14:49,763
I did the end pieces with the tassels.

206
00:14:49,974 --> 00:14:53,273
And here's a little gift
from Grandpa George and me.

207
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:55,809
I think I know what this is.

208
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,441
- It is! A Wonka!
- Open it, Charlie.

209
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:00,946
Let's see that Golden Ticket.

210
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:03,584
- Wouldn't it be fantastic?
- Don't raise his hopes.

211
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,784
Never mind. Open it.
I want to see that gold!

212
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,217
Stop it!

213
00:15:08,424 --> 00:15:11,791
- I've got the same chance as anybody!
- You've got more.

214
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,483
You want it more.

215
00:15:13,761 --> 00:15:15,126
Go on, open it!

216
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,922
Here goes!

217
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:21,165
- I got it!
- Where?

218
00:15:21,602 --> 00:15:22,591
Let's see!

219
00:15:22,936 --> 00:15:24,767
Fooled you, didn't I?

220
00:15:25,005 --> 00:15:26,939
You thought I really had it.

221
00:15:28,442 --> 00:15:30,409
Never mind, Charlie.

222
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,168
You'll find one.

223
00:15:32,945 --> 00:15:35,937
- Here, everybody have a bite.
- No, no!

224
00:15:48,092 --> 00:15:50,890
I wanted to find the first
Golden ticket, Daddy!

225
00:15:51,095 --> 00:15:54,292
I know, angel.
We're doing the best we can.

226
00:15:54,498 --> 00:15:57,227
I've got every girl on staff
hunting for you.

227
00:15:57,433 --> 00:15:59,628
Where is it?
Why can't they find it?

228
00:15:59,836 --> 00:16:02,999
Veruca, sweetheart,
I'm not a magician!

229
00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:04,462
Give me time!

230
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:07,801
I want it now!
What's the matter with those twerps?

231
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,468
For five days now,
the entire factory's been on the job!

232
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,409
They haven't shelled a peanut
since Monday!

233
00:16:14,615 --> 00:16:18,107
They've been shelling
chocolate bars from dawn to dusk!

234
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:19,650
Work nights!

235
00:16:21,655 --> 00:16:23,452
Come along, you girls!

236
00:16:23,657 --> 00:16:26,490
Put a jerk in it,
or you'll be out on your ears!

237
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,455
And listen: The first girl...

238
00:16:28,662 --> 00:16:33,121
...that finds a Golden Ticket
gets a bonus in their pay packet!

239
00:16:33,332 --> 00:16:34,993
What do you think of that?!

240
00:16:37,102 --> 00:16:38,568
They're not even trying!

241
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,102
They don't want to find it!

242
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:43,500
Sweetheart,
I can't push them no harder.

243
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,073
19,000 bars an hour they're shelling!

244
00:16:46,277 --> 00:16:48,642
760,000 they've done so far!

245
00:16:48,845 --> 00:16:49,903
You promised!

246
00:16:50,113 --> 00:16:52,741
You promised I'd have it the first day!

247
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:56,817
You're going to be very unpopular
if you don't deliver soon.

248
00:16:57,053 --> 00:17:00,318
It breaks my heart.
I hate to see her unhappy.

249
00:17:00,523 --> 00:17:02,081
I won't talk to you!

250
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:05,589
You're a rotten father!
You never give me anything!

251
00:17:05,794 --> 00:17:07,591
I won't go to school!

252
00:17:07,796 --> 00:17:10,356
Veruca! Sweetheart! Angel!

253
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:13,326
There are only 4 tickets
left in the world...

254
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:16,162
...and the whole world's
hunting for them!

255
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,200
What can I do?

256
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:20,702
I got it, Mr. Salt! Here it is!

257
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,644
About time, too! I want it!

258
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,518
Give me my ticket! It's mine!

259
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,210
I found the Golden Ticket!

260
00:17:41,892 --> 00:17:42,950
Thank God!

261
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,288
Happiness is what counts with children.

262
00:17:46,497 --> 00:17:48,555
Happiness and harmony.

263
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:53,792
This is the sign of our times.
The symbol of the havoc...

264
00:17:54,004 --> 00:17:56,699
...the mad craze
that's sweeping the world.

265
00:17:56,905 --> 00:18:01,035
Whatever corner of the globe we are in,
whichever continent we're on...

266
00:18:01,243 --> 00:18:04,837
...the great Wonka Bar search continues.
We're near the end...

267
00:18:05,113 --> 00:18:08,844
...of our 43rd day
in the Golden Ticket hunt.

268
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,181
Everywhere, are signs of anxiety.

269
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,145
Every hour...

270
00:18:13,353 --> 00:18:16,015
...new shipments
are sent around the globe.

271
00:18:16,356 --> 00:18:18,347
But they're not moving fast enough.

272
00:18:18,592 --> 00:18:22,994
And as time passes the men who seek them
become more and more desperate.

273
00:18:23,195 --> 00:18:27,325
Gentlemen, I know how anxious
you've been during these last few days.

274
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:29,899
But now I think I can safely say...

275
00:18:30,102 --> 00:18:32,831
...that your time and money
have been well spent.

276
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:37,037
We're about to witness
the greatest miracle of the machine age.

277
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:41,075
Based on the revolutionary
law of probability, this machine...

278
00:18:41,278 --> 00:18:45,339
...will tell us the precise location
of the three remaining...

279
00:18:45,783 --> 00:18:47,444
...Golden Tickets.

280
00:18:56,224 --> 00:18:56,918
It says...

281
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,958
..."I won't tell.
That would be cheating. "

282
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,698
I am now telling the computer...

283
00:19:08,903 --> 00:19:12,930
...if it will tell me the correct answer
I will gladly share with it...

284
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,902
...the grand prize.

285
00:19:19,579 --> 00:19:20,204
He says...

286
00:19:20,413 --> 00:19:25,145
..."What would a computer do
with a lifetime supply of chocolate?"

287
00:19:29,321 --> 00:19:34,223
I am now telling the computer exactly
what he can do with the chocolate.

288
00:19:36,661 --> 00:19:39,891
It can happen here, too,
unbelievable as it sounds...

289
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:41,724
...right here in America.

290
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:45,891
Where even in the smallest town,
the happiest dreams can come true.

291
00:19:46,737 --> 00:19:47,998
Here she is...

292
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:52,068
...Violet Beauregarde,
finder of Golden Ticket number 3.

293
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,969
From Miles City, Montana.

294
00:19:54,176 --> 00:19:55,575
And the proud parents.

295
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,974
Mr. Beauregarde,
a local politician, civic leader...

296
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,307
Sam Beauregarde,
Square Deal Sam to you...

297
00:20:01,516 --> 00:20:03,450
...with great giveaway bargains.

298
00:20:03,685 --> 00:20:06,084
The finest values in the entire country!

299
00:20:06,286 --> 00:20:08,413
- Here's a sedan...
- Dad, they don't want you!

300
00:20:08,622 --> 00:20:10,453
- Care to say a few words?
- Sure!

301
00:20:10,691 --> 00:20:13,853
Here is Golden Ticket number 3,
and it's all mine!

302
00:20:15,128 --> 00:20:17,926
I'm a gum chewer,
but when I heard about the tickets...

303
00:20:18,131 --> 00:20:20,258
...I laid off gum and switched to candy.

304
00:20:21,033 --> 00:20:22,829
Now, of course, I'm back on gum.

305
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:25,936
I chew it all day, except at mealtimes
when I stick it behind my ear.

306
00:20:26,037 --> 00:20:27,595
- Violet!
- Cool it, Mother!

307
00:20:27,806 --> 00:20:32,674
This piece of gum I've been chewing
for three months. A world record!

308
00:20:32,877 --> 00:20:36,108
It beat the record
held by my friend, Cornelia...

309
00:20:36,313 --> 00:20:38,110
...and was she mad!

310
00:20:38,315 --> 00:20:39,781
Hi Cornelia, sweetie!

311
00:20:39,983 --> 00:20:42,884
Let me just say,
if any of you folks watching...

312
00:20:54,396 --> 00:20:57,626
- What are you doing here?
- I'll walk you home.

313
00:20:57,999 --> 00:21:01,127
I'm not ready.
I'm going to be here late.

314
00:21:01,335 --> 00:21:03,963
Then I guess I'll be going.

315
00:21:04,172 --> 00:21:05,866
Why not stay a minute.

316
00:21:06,072 --> 00:21:09,166
Pull up a pile of clothes and sit down.

317
00:21:11,745 --> 00:21:13,303
School all right?

318
00:21:13,513 --> 00:21:14,308
Yep.

319
00:21:14,513 --> 00:21:15,571
Good.

320
00:21:16,415 --> 00:21:18,007
Go on your newspaper route?

321
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,217
Just finished.

322
00:21:19,418 --> 00:21:20,510
Good.

323
00:21:23,188 --> 00:21:25,247
I wanted to tell you something.

324
00:21:28,092 --> 00:21:29,821
They found the third ticket.

325
00:21:30,028 --> 00:21:31,255
Did they?

326
00:21:35,032 --> 00:21:36,693
I guess I'll be going now.

327
00:21:38,035 --> 00:21:39,195
That's all?

328
00:21:40,436 --> 00:21:42,336
I thought you'd like to know.

329
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:46,167
Most people are pretty interested.
I know I'm interested.

330
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:49,537
There are only two tickets left,
you know. Just two.

331
00:21:49,778 --> 00:21:51,575
Pretty soon, just one.

332
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,509
I wonder who'll be the lucky ones.

333
00:21:53,715 --> 00:21:55,740
If you're wondering,
it won't be me.

334
00:21:55,951 --> 00:21:58,851
If you're wondering,
you can count me out.

335
00:22:00,287 --> 00:22:02,414
There are 100 billion people...

336
00:22:02,623 --> 00:22:05,750
...and only 5 will find Golden Tickets.

337
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:09,190
Even with a sack of money,
you probably wouldn't find one.

338
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:14,025
When this is over you'll be no different
from billions of others who didn't.

339
00:22:14,234 --> 00:22:17,031
But I am different.
I want it more than any of them.

340
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,435
You'll get your chance.
One day things will change.

341
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,971
When? When will they change?

342
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,574
Probably when you least expect it.

343
00:22:29,814 --> 00:22:30,906
See you later.

344
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,753
You get blue like everyone

345
00:22:49,597 --> 00:22:52,657
But me and Grandpa Joe

346
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:57,001
Can make your troubles go away

347
00:22:57,638 --> 00:22:59,663
Blow away

348
00:23:01,174 --> 00:23:03,506
There they go

349
00:23:05,612 --> 00:23:07,841
Cheer up, Charlie

350
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:11,513
Give me a smile

351
00:23:12,118 --> 00:23:16,520
What happened
to that smile I used to know

352
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,917
Don't you know your grin

353
00:23:21,126 --> 00:23:24,526
Has always been my sunshine

354
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:29,022
Let that sunshine show

355
00:23:31,901 --> 00:23:34,131
Come on, Charlie

356
00:23:35,972 --> 00:23:38,304
No need to frown

357
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,535
Deep down you know

358
00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:43,538
The world is still your toy

359
00:23:45,881 --> 00:23:47,974
When the world gets heavy

360
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,881
Never pit-a-pat 'em

361
00:23:52,219 --> 00:23:55,211
Up and at 'em, boy

362
00:23:58,325 --> 00:23:59,986
Some day...

363
00:24:00,894 --> 00:24:02,885
...sweet as a song

364
00:24:03,897 --> 00:24:07,889
Charlie's lucky day will come along

365
00:24:10,502 --> 00:24:15,165
Till that day
you've got to stay strong, Charlie

366
00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:21,735
Up on top is right where you belong

367
00:24:24,414 --> 00:24:27,747
Look up, Charlie

368
00:24:28,185 --> 00:24:31,154
You'll see a star

369
00:24:31,355 --> 00:24:32,844
Just follow it

370
00:24:33,255 --> 00:24:37,248
And keep your dream in view

371
00:24:38,427 --> 00:24:43,090
Pretty soon the sky
is going to clear up, Charlie

372
00:24:45,934 --> 00:24:49,926
Cheer up, Charlie, do

373
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:55,201
Cheer up, Charlie

374
00:24:57,044 --> 00:25:00,376
Just be glad you're you

375
00:25:10,455 --> 00:25:12,116
While the world searches...

376
00:25:12,391 --> 00:25:14,052
...here it has actually happened.

377
00:25:14,626 --> 00:25:18,527
There's only one Golden Ticket
left in the entire world.

378
00:25:18,729 --> 00:25:22,187
Because right here,
in Marble Falls, Arizona...

379
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,196
...is lucky winner number four!

380
00:25:24,401 --> 00:25:28,201
The name to be heard around
the universe is Mr. Mike Teevee!

381
00:25:28,805 --> 00:25:30,204
Can we shut that off?

382
00:25:30,407 --> 00:25:33,204
- Are you crazy?
- He won't answer till station break.

383
00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:35,434
The country wants to hear from you!

384
00:25:35,644 --> 00:25:37,771
Can't you shut up?
I'm busy.

385
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,106
What a show!

386
00:25:39,314 --> 00:25:41,111
I serve all his dinners here.

387
00:25:41,315 --> 00:25:42,782
He's never been to the table.

388
00:25:43,384 --> 00:25:44,783
- You love TV?
- You bet!

389
00:25:44,986 --> 00:25:46,613
About that Golden ticket...

390
00:25:46,821 --> 00:25:48,220
I want to catch this!

391
00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:51,391
- Like killings?
- What do you think life's all about?

392
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,320
Mike, would you tell us if...

393
00:25:54,995 --> 00:25:56,462
Wait till I get a real one.

394
00:25:56,663 --> 00:25:57,755
Colt 45.

395
00:25:57,998 --> 00:26:00,227
Pop won't let me have one yet, will you?

396
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,424
Not till you're 12, son.

397
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,805
Four down, one to go.

398
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:15,139
And somewhere out there another
lucky person is moving closer...

399
00:26:15,346 --> 00:26:20,112
...to finding the last of the most
sought-after prizes in history.

400
00:26:20,617 --> 00:26:23,245
Though we can envy him,
whoever he is...

401
00:26:23,454 --> 00:26:26,422
...and might be tempted
to be bitter at our losing...

402
00:26:26,622 --> 00:26:29,591
...we must remember there are
more important things.

403
00:26:29,792 --> 00:26:32,283
Many more important things!

404
00:26:32,628 --> 00:26:36,358
Offhand, I can't think of what they are
but I'm sure there's something.

405
00:26:36,631 --> 00:26:38,121
Now for weather and...

406
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:43,701
Why did you wake me up?
Is something wrong?

407
00:26:49,643 --> 00:26:51,803
Grandpa!
That money was for tobacco.

408
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:54,171
I've told you, I've given it up.

409
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:55,778
Go on, open it!

410
00:26:55,982 --> 00:26:58,007
One ticket left.
Let's see that gold.

411
00:26:58,218 --> 00:27:00,549
No, you do it. I can't.

412
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:03,848
We're going to be lucky this time.

413
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:06,490
I've got a funny feeling inside.

414
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:10,658
Which end shall I open first?

415
00:27:11,829 --> 00:27:13,888
That end. Just a tiny bit.

416
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:18,225
- Like this?
- Now a bit more.

417
00:27:19,402 --> 00:27:22,337
- You finish it! I can't.
- No, Grandpa! You do it.

418
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:24,170
All right.

419
00:27:24,508 --> 00:27:25,997
Here goes.

420
00:27:32,248 --> 00:27:33,407
You know...

421
00:27:34,415 --> 00:27:38,408
...I bet those Golden Tickets
make the chocolate taste terrible.

422
00:27:48,695 --> 00:27:50,753
Lot 403.

423
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:53,396
I can personally guarantee...

424
00:27:53,633 --> 00:27:57,330
...that this is the absolutely
last case of Wonka Bars...

425
00:27:57,537 --> 00:27:59,060
...left in the United Kingdom.

426
00:27:59,271 --> 00:28:03,037
Shall we start the bidding at
1,000 pounds? Do I hear 1,000?

427
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:05,002
1,500 pounds?

428
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,609
2,000?

429
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:08,038
I have 2,500.

430
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:09,041
4,000?

431
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,247
4,500 pounds?

432
00:28:11,448 --> 00:28:13,075
5,000?

433
00:28:13,284 --> 00:28:14,945
Your Majesty!

434
00:28:18,454 --> 00:28:20,183
I'm sorry, Mrs. Curtis.

435
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,585
There isn't anything to give us a clue.

436
00:28:22,792 --> 00:28:24,850
They kidnapped my husband
12 hours ago.

437
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,085
When will we hear?
What do they want?

438
00:28:27,296 --> 00:28:30,959
Stay calm. They want ransom.
We wait to hear their demands.

439
00:28:31,466 --> 00:28:33,695
I'll give them anything they want.

440
00:28:33,901 --> 00:28:35,732
All I want is Harold back!

441
00:28:41,142 --> 00:28:42,574
Go ahead, we're listening.

442
00:28:48,248 --> 00:28:50,807
Whatever they asked for
they can have it.

443
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,241
They want your case of Wonka Bars.

444
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:01,151
Did you hear me?

445
00:29:01,993 --> 00:29:04,928
It's your husband's life
or your Wonka Bars.

446
00:29:06,164 --> 00:29:08,256
How long do I have to think it over?

447
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,967
That's it!

448
00:29:11,168 --> 00:29:13,636
The Wonka contest is all over.

449
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:15,896
The final ticket has been found...

450
00:29:16,106 --> 00:29:20,508
...we've got a live report in from
Paraguay, South America.

451
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,144
It is finished.
The end has come.

452
00:29:23,346 --> 00:29:26,075
The last Golden Ticket has been found...

453
00:29:26,281 --> 00:29:27,646
...right here in Paraguay.

454
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,818
The finder is lucky Alberto Minoleta...

455
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,818
...the millionaire owner
of South America gambling casinos.

456
00:29:35,022 --> 00:29:38,480
Here is the most recent picture
of the happy finder.

457
00:29:39,927 --> 00:29:41,258
Turn it off!

458
00:29:42,695 --> 00:29:44,663
Well, that's that.

459
00:29:44,864 --> 00:29:46,422
No more Golden Tickets.

460
00:29:46,633 --> 00:29:48,658
A lot of rubbish, the whole thing.

461
00:29:48,868 --> 00:29:50,301
Not to Charlie, it wasn't.

462
00:29:50,536 --> 00:29:55,336
A boy needs something to hope for.
What's he got to hope for now?

463
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,633
Who's going to tell him?

464
00:29:57,876 --> 00:30:00,776
Let's not wake him.
He'll find out soon enough.

465
00:30:00,978 --> 00:30:02,445
Yeah, let him sleep.

466
00:30:02,647 --> 00:30:05,047
Let him have one last dream.

467
00:30:12,822 --> 00:30:15,620
I've decided to switch
Friday's schedule to Monday.

468
00:30:15,825 --> 00:30:19,453
Which means Friday's test
on what we learned during the week...

469
00:30:19,662 --> 00:30:21,960
...will now be Monday
before we've learned it.

470
00:30:22,164 --> 00:30:24,394
Since today's Tuesday,
it doesn't matter.

471
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:26,561
Pencils ready!

472
00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:31,070
Today, we are going to learn about...

473
00:30:32,674 --> 00:30:33,538
...percentages.

474
00:30:33,741 --> 00:30:37,369
For example, let's take
the recent unpleasantness.

475
00:30:37,577 --> 00:30:40,637
Suppose there are
1,000 Wonka Bars in the world...

476
00:30:40,847 --> 00:30:44,646
...and you each opened
a certain number of them.

477
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:47,011
That number is...

478
00:30:47,353 --> 00:30:49,014
...a percent. Understand?

479
00:30:51,423 --> 00:30:53,948
Madeline Durkin, how many
Wonka Bars did you open?

480
00:30:54,526 --> 00:30:55,584
About 100.

481
00:30:55,927 --> 00:31:00,886
There are ten 100's in 1,000,
therefore, you opened 10 percent.

482
00:31:01,365 --> 00:31:03,663
Peter Goff, how many did you open?

483
00:31:03,867 --> 00:31:05,095
150.

484
00:31:05,536 --> 00:31:10,336
10% half over again, which makes
15 percent. Charlie Bucket!

485
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,735
- How many did you open?
- Two.

486
00:31:12,942 --> 00:31:14,432
That's easy. 200 is twice...

487
00:31:15,745 --> 00:31:17,144
Not 200.

488
00:31:17,713 --> 00:31:18,737
Just 2.

489
00:31:19,381 --> 00:31:22,111
What do you mean, you only opened 2?

490
00:31:22,617 --> 00:31:24,585
I don't care much for chocolate.

491
00:31:24,786 --> 00:31:26,685
I can't figure out just 2!

492
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:29,014
Let's pretend you opened 200.

493
00:31:29,223 --> 00:31:33,523
If you opened 200 Wonka Bars,
apart from being dreadfully sick...

494
00:31:33,728 --> 00:31:35,354
...you'd use 20% of 1,000...

495
00:31:35,562 --> 00:31:38,463
...which is 15 percent half again,
10 percent...

496
00:32:28,175 --> 00:32:30,040
I'd like a bar of chocolate, please.

497
00:32:30,244 --> 00:32:31,370
Why, sure.

498
00:32:31,578 --> 00:32:32,636
What kind?

499
00:32:32,846 --> 00:32:35,814
A Slugworth Sizzler?
A Wonka Scrumdiddleumptious?

500
00:32:36,015 --> 00:32:39,007
- Whichever's biggest.
- Try a Wonka Scrumdiddleumptious.

501
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,082
Now that the tickets are found,
I don't have to hide them.

502
00:32:56,033 --> 00:32:57,660
Take it easy!

503
00:32:57,868 --> 00:33:00,029
You'll get a stomach ache.

504
00:33:00,371 --> 00:33:02,270
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye, now.

505
00:33:10,045 --> 00:33:13,378
I think I'll buy just one more,
for my Grandpa Joe.

506
00:33:13,615 --> 00:33:14,877
Sure.

507
00:33:15,951 --> 00:33:17,850
Try a regular Wonka Bar.

508
00:33:18,052 --> 00:33:19,383
Fine.

509
00:33:32,299 --> 00:33:35,426
- Take it easy! One at a time!
- Did you hear the news?

510
00:33:35,668 --> 00:33:37,966
That gambler from Paraguay
made a phony ticket.

511
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:41,298
There's one Golden Ticket
still floating around.

512
00:33:41,507 --> 00:33:44,441
The nerve of that guy!
Trying to fool the world!

513
00:33:45,276 --> 00:33:49,110
He was a crook! This means
the contest goes on forever.

514
00:34:33,052 --> 00:34:34,952
You got the last Golden Ticket!

515
00:34:35,154 --> 00:34:37,986
The kid's found the last Golden Ticket!

516
00:34:41,493 --> 00:34:43,893
Stand back!
Leave the boy alone!

517
00:34:46,731 --> 00:34:48,062
Break it up!

518
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,300
Charlie! Hold onto that ticket!

519
00:34:51,502 --> 00:34:53,969
Run for it! Run straight home!

520
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:56,229
Don't stop till you get there!

521
00:35:27,867 --> 00:35:29,494
I congratulate you.

522
00:35:29,702 --> 00:35:30,930
Well done.

523
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:33,838
You've found the fifth Golden Ticket.

524
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,870
May I introduce myself?

525
00:35:36,107 --> 00:35:37,665
Arthur Slugworth.

526
00:35:37,876 --> 00:35:40,436
President of Slugworth Chocolates.

527
00:35:41,279 --> 00:35:45,180
Listen carefully, because
I'm going to make you very rich.

528
00:35:45,382 --> 00:35:49,113
Mr. Wonka is working on
a fantastic invention.

529
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,884
The Everlasting Gobstopper.

530
00:35:52,556 --> 00:35:54,580
If he succeeds, he'll ruin me.

531
00:35:54,791 --> 00:35:58,090
I want you to get just one
Everlasting Gobstopper...

532
00:35:58,294 --> 00:36:01,626
...and bring it to me
so I can find the secret formula.

533
00:36:01,964 --> 00:36:03,261
Your reward will be...

534
00:36:03,465 --> 00:36:05,524
...10,000 of these.

535
00:36:05,734 --> 00:36:07,395
Think it over, will you?

536
00:36:07,636 --> 00:36:09,604
A new house for your family...

537
00:36:09,805 --> 00:36:13,069
...food and comfort
for the rest of their lives.

538
00:36:13,908 --> 00:36:15,705
And don't forget the name...

539
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:18,140
...Everlasting Gobstopper.

540
00:36:47,504 --> 00:36:50,667
I've got it!
The fifth Golden Ticket is mine!

541
00:36:51,441 --> 00:36:53,567
You're pulling our legs, Charlie.

542
00:36:53,776 --> 00:36:56,574
There aren't any more Golden Tickets.

543
00:36:56,779 --> 00:36:59,145
The last one's fake!
It's in the paper!

544
00:36:59,348 --> 00:37:02,908
I found money, bought a Wonka Bar
and the ticket was in it!

545
00:37:03,118 --> 00:37:05,450
Look at it! See for yourself!

546
00:37:06,021 --> 00:37:08,455
Read it, Joe, for heaven's sake!

547
00:37:09,024 --> 00:37:13,323
"Greetings to you, the lucky finder
of this Golden Ticket...

548
00:37:13,527 --> 00:37:17,486
"... from Mr. Willy Wonka. Present
this ticket at the factory gates...

549
00:37:17,698 --> 00:37:21,929
"... at 10 o'clock in the morning,
October 1st, and do not be late!"

550
00:37:22,135 --> 00:37:26,936
"You may bring with you one member
of your own family, but no one else.

551
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:30,267
"In your wildest dreams
you could not imagine...

552
00:37:30,475 --> 00:37:33,501
"... the marvelous surprises
that await you!"

553
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:34,644
You've done it!

554
00:37:37,148 --> 00:37:39,776
It says I can take somebody with me.

555
00:37:39,984 --> 00:37:41,645
I wish you could go.

556
00:37:52,162 --> 00:37:53,322
Charlie!

557
00:38:00,169 --> 00:38:01,966
That's good, Charlie.

558
00:38:02,171 --> 00:38:03,728
Now help me up.

559
00:38:17,184 --> 00:38:18,310
Are you okay?

560
00:38:18,518 --> 00:38:20,576
I'm fine, Charlie.

561
00:38:30,595 --> 00:38:32,085
Watch it, Joe!

562
00:38:41,271 --> 00:38:42,761
Look at me!

563
00:38:45,775 --> 00:38:47,606
Look at me!

564
00:38:48,277 --> 00:38:50,268
Up and about!

565
00:38:51,881 --> 00:38:55,213
I haven't done this in 20 years!

566
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:05,089
I never thought my life could be

567
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:10,094
Anything but catastrophe

568
00:39:11,431 --> 00:39:14,423
But suddenly I begin to see

569
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:18,431
A bit of good luck for me

570
00:39:20,773 --> 00:39:24,436
'Cause I've got a Golden Ticket

571
00:39:26,445 --> 00:39:29,436
I've got a golden twinkle...

572
00:39:30,782 --> 00:39:32,773
...in my eye

573
00:39:36,788 --> 00:39:39,347
I never had a chance to shine

574
00:39:39,556 --> 00:39:41,581
Never a happy song to sing

575
00:39:41,792 --> 00:39:43,760
But suddenly half the world is mine

576
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,518
What an amazing thing

577
00:39:45,728 --> 00:39:47,593
'Cause I've got a Golden Ticket

578
00:39:47,797 --> 00:39:49,287
It's ours, Charlie!

579
00:39:49,799 --> 00:39:53,132
I've got a golden sun up in the sky

580
00:39:53,636 --> 00:39:55,296
Slippers, Charlie!

581
00:39:57,739 --> 00:40:01,038
I never thought I'd see the day
When I would face the world and say

582
00:40:01,342 --> 00:40:04,174
Good morning
Look at the sun

583
00:40:05,012 --> 00:40:08,539
I never thought that I would be
Slap in the lap of luxury

584
00:40:08,749 --> 00:40:10,307
'Cause I'd have said

585
00:40:10,517 --> 00:40:12,040
It couldn't be done

586
00:40:12,251 --> 00:40:14,014
But it can be done

587
00:40:15,588 --> 00:40:17,579
The cane, Charlie!

588
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,918
Here I go!

589
00:40:24,863 --> 00:40:26,694
Watch my speed!

590
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:36,831
I never dreamed that I would climb
Over the moon in ecstasy

591
00:40:37,041 --> 00:40:41,067
But nevertheless it's there that I'm
Shortly about to be

592
00:40:41,277 --> 00:40:42,710
'Cause I've got a Golden Ticket

593
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:48,079
I've got a golden chance to make my way

594
00:40:48,283 --> 00:40:52,276
And with a Golden Ticket
It's a golden day

595
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:12,627
Good morning! Look at the sun!

596
00:41:17,076 --> 00:41:20,806
'Cause I'd have said
It couldn't be done

597
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,306
But it can be done

598
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:28,384
I never dreamed that I would climb
Over the moon in ecstasy

599
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:32,453
But, nevertheless, it's there that I'm
Shortly about to be

600
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:35,147
'Cause I've got a Golden Ticket

601
00:41:35,492 --> 00:41:37,392
I've got a Golden Ticket

602
00:41:37,594 --> 00:41:41,222
I've got a golden chance to make my way

603
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:45,423
And with a Golden Ticket
It's a golden day

604
00:41:50,272 --> 00:41:53,639
Stop! It says the first of October.
That's tomorrow.

605
00:41:53,842 --> 00:41:57,902
We've got a lot to do! Comb your hair,
wash your face, polish your shoes...

606
00:41:58,112 --> 00:42:01,138
- I'll take care of everything.
- We don't have much time.

607
00:42:01,348 --> 00:42:05,340
Grandpa... on the way home today,
I ran into Mr. Slugworth.

608
00:42:30,206 --> 00:42:31,935
Hey, Mom, we're on TV!

609
00:42:32,142 --> 00:42:34,110
Hi, everybody in Marble Falls!

610
00:42:34,311 --> 00:42:36,939
Hi, Billy! Hi, Maggie! Hi, Fishface!

611
00:42:37,147 --> 00:42:38,010
How do I look?

612
00:42:38,213 --> 00:42:39,680
- You guys ready?
- You're on.

613
00:42:39,882 --> 00:42:41,509
This is the big day.

614
00:42:41,717 --> 00:42:46,619
The day Willy Wonka will open his gates
and shower gifts on the 5 lucky winners.

615
00:42:46,821 --> 00:42:50,120
From over the globe, people have
gathered, waiting for the hour...

616
00:42:50,325 --> 00:42:53,556
...to see that legendary magician,
Mr. Willy Wonka.

617
00:42:56,063 --> 00:42:59,521
Hi, friends! Don't forget
to visit Beauregarde's Auto Mart...

618
00:42:59,733 --> 00:43:02,634
Cut it out, Dad!
This is my show!

619
00:43:02,836 --> 00:43:06,669
Hi, Cornelia! I've still got it.
How's this for a stretch?

620
00:43:19,851 --> 00:43:22,148
I want to go in first, before anybody.

621
00:43:22,353 --> 00:43:24,184
Anything you say.

622
00:43:27,424 --> 00:43:30,859
Save some room for later,
Augustus liebling.

623
00:43:33,763 --> 00:43:37,494
I don't believe it! We did it.
We're actually going in.

624
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:41,430
To see the greatest of them all,
Mr. Willy Wonka!

625
00:45:26,362 --> 00:45:27,693
Thank you.

626
00:45:28,698 --> 00:45:29,926
Welcome, my friends.

627
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,224
Welcome to my chocolate factory.

628
00:45:32,868 --> 00:45:34,130
Would you come forward?

629
00:45:35,304 --> 00:45:37,431
Get back!
Come on, Veruca!

630
00:45:43,344 --> 00:45:45,778
That's Slugworth,
the man I told you about.

631
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:53,283
Welcome.
It's nice to have you here.

632
00:45:53,687 --> 00:45:55,086
I'm so glad you could come.

633
00:45:55,288 --> 00:45:59,189
This is going to be such an
exciting day. I hope you enjoy it.

634
00:45:59,625 --> 00:46:01,115
I think you will.

635
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,553
Please show me your Golden tickets.

636
00:46:04,697 --> 00:46:06,095
I'm Veruca Salt.

637
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:08,424
Dear Veruca, what a pleasure!

638
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:10,760
You look pretty in that mink coat!

639
00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:12,630
I've got three others.

640
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:17,037
Overjoyed to see you, sir.
Would you just step over there?

641
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:18,274
Augustus Gloop.

642
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:20,443
Augustus, my dear boy!

643
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:23,271
Good to see you, and in such fine shape!

644
00:46:23,479 --> 00:46:27,347
This must be the radiant Mrs. Gloop.
Over there, dear lady.

645
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:30,677
- Violet Beauregarde.
- Darling child! Welcome to Wonka's.

646
00:46:30,886 --> 00:46:32,353
What kind of gum you got?

647
00:46:32,554 --> 00:46:33,816
Charming!

648
00:46:34,322 --> 00:46:35,619
Sam Beauregarde here!

649
00:46:35,824 --> 00:46:37,348
What a genuine pleasure.

650
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:40,789
Any automotive needs, call.
Phone number's on the card.

651
00:46:40,995 --> 00:46:43,054
"With Sam B., it's a guarantee!"

652
00:46:43,998 --> 00:46:45,693
I'm Mike Teevee.

653
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,367
Wham, you're dead!

654
00:46:47,568 --> 00:46:48,864
Wonderful to meet you!

655
00:46:49,068 --> 00:46:50,865
Mrs. Teevee, how do you do?

656
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:53,732
- What an adorable boy you have.
- Thank you.

657
00:46:54,407 --> 00:46:55,203
Charlie Bucket.

658
00:46:55,408 --> 00:46:59,867
I read all about you in the papers.
I'm so happy for you. And who's this?

659
00:47:00,078 --> 00:47:01,636
My grandfather, Grandpa Joe.

660
00:47:01,847 --> 00:47:02,779
Delighted.

661
00:47:03,015 --> 00:47:05,141
Overjoyed. Enraptured. Entranced.

662
00:47:05,349 --> 00:47:06,839
Are we ready?
Yes! Good!

663
00:47:07,185 --> 00:47:08,516
In with you!

664
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:46,182
Hats, coats, galoshes over here.

665
00:47:46,353 --> 00:47:49,412
Hurry, we have so much time
and so little to see.

666
00:47:49,622 --> 00:47:51,590
Wait a minute! Strike that.

667
00:47:51,791 --> 00:47:54,123
Reverse it. Thank you.

668
00:47:56,028 --> 00:47:59,326
- When do I get my chocolate?
- First take off your coat, Violet.

669
00:47:59,531 --> 00:48:00,964
Boy, what weird coat hangers!

670
00:48:03,635 --> 00:48:08,037
Surprises around every corner, but
nothing dangerous! Don't be alarmed.

671
00:48:08,305 --> 00:48:10,933
As soon as your outer vestments
are in hand...

672
00:48:11,141 --> 00:48:12,472
...we'll begin.

673
00:48:13,143 --> 00:48:14,006
Now...

674
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:17,202
...will the children
kindly step up here.

675
00:48:28,257 --> 00:48:30,316
Accidents? What kind of accidents?

676
00:48:30,592 --> 00:48:33,059
I didn't know we had to sign anything.

677
00:48:33,261 --> 00:48:34,819
I can't read the bottom.

678
00:48:35,363 --> 00:48:37,228
Violet, you first.

679
00:48:37,431 --> 00:48:38,557
Sign here.

680
00:48:38,766 --> 00:48:39,733
Hold it!

681
00:48:39,933 --> 00:48:42,163
Let me through.
Don't sign anything.

682
00:48:42,435 --> 00:48:43,663
What's this about?

683
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:45,497
Standard form of contract.

684
00:48:45,705 --> 00:48:49,333
Don't talk contracts, I use them myself.
They're for suckers.

685
00:48:49,541 --> 00:48:52,840
You wouldn't begrudge me
a little protection? A drop?

686
00:48:53,045 --> 00:48:54,376
I don't sign anything without my lawyer.

687
00:48:54,613 --> 00:48:57,342
- Veruca don't sign anything either!
- Then she don't go in.

688
00:48:57,615 --> 00:48:59,173
I'm sorry. House rules.

689
00:48:59,384 --> 00:49:03,343
- I want to go in. Don't try to stop me!
- I'm only trying to help.

690
00:49:03,554 --> 00:49:07,956
Give me that pen!
You're always making things difficult.

691
00:49:08,792 --> 00:49:12,421
Nicely handled! She's a girl
who knows where she's going.

692
00:49:13,563 --> 00:49:15,393
What's all that small print?

693
00:49:16,065 --> 00:49:18,761
Any problems? Dial Information.
Thanks for calling.

694
00:49:22,338 --> 00:49:24,805
I assume there's
an accident indemnity clause?

695
00:49:25,006 --> 00:49:25,995
Never between friends.

696
00:49:26,574 --> 00:49:29,771
Saw this in a movie. A guy signed
his wife's insurance policy.

697
00:49:30,178 --> 00:49:31,974
- Then he bumped her off.
- Clever.

698
00:49:32,112 --> 00:49:33,044
What about me, Grandpa?

699
00:49:33,247 --> 00:49:35,647
Sign away, Charlie!
We've got nothing to lose.

700
00:49:35,849 --> 00:49:37,817
Let's go in! Come on!

701
00:49:38,018 --> 00:49:41,145
Patience.
Everything has to be in order.

702
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:43,185
Everyone signed? Yes?

703
00:49:43,523 --> 00:49:45,013
Good. On we go!

704
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,091
Ninety-nine...

705
00:49:56,435 --> 00:49:57,594
...forty-four...

706
00:49:57,935 --> 00:49:59,698
...one hundred percent pure.

707
00:50:01,372 --> 00:50:03,533
Just through the other door, please.

708
00:50:05,876 --> 00:50:07,706
There's some mistake here.

709
00:50:08,378 --> 00:50:10,107
There is no other door.

710
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,506
There's no way out!

711
00:50:11,715 --> 00:50:14,513
I know there's a door here someplace.

712
00:50:14,717 --> 00:50:16,582
I don't like this, Wonka!

713
00:50:16,785 --> 00:50:18,082
Is this a trick?

714
00:50:18,287 --> 00:50:20,187
Mr. Wonka, help!

715
00:50:20,389 --> 00:50:21,856
I'm getting squashed!
Save me!

716
00:50:22,057 --> 00:50:24,422
Is it my soul that calls my name?

717
00:50:24,625 --> 00:50:26,058
Let me out or I'll scream!

718
00:50:26,394 --> 00:50:28,760
- Somebody's touching me!
- Now look here, Wonka!

719
00:50:28,963 --> 00:50:33,558
Question time will come at the end
of the session. We must press on.

720
00:50:35,168 --> 00:50:36,795
- Here we are.
- Don't be a fool.

721
00:50:37,003 --> 00:50:38,436
That's the way we came in.

722
00:50:38,772 --> 00:50:40,898
It is? Are you sure?

723
00:50:41,607 --> 00:50:43,302
We've just come through there.

724
00:50:43,509 --> 00:50:44,999
How do you like that?

725
00:50:46,278 --> 00:50:48,143
- There we are.
- What is this, Wonka?

726
00:50:48,347 --> 00:50:49,142
A funhouse?

727
00:50:50,115 --> 00:50:51,241
Why? Having fun?

728
00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:53,417
I'm not going in there.

729
00:50:53,618 --> 00:50:55,245
We're getting out of here.

730
00:50:55,453 --> 00:50:58,910
You can't get out backwards.
You have to go forward to go back.

731
00:50:59,123 --> 00:51:00,613
Better press on.

732
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:04,085
- The room is getting smaller.
- No, it's not!

733
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:06,523
- He's getting bigger.
- He's at it again.

734
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:09,659
- Where's the chocolate?
- I doubt if there is any.

735
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:11,959
I doubt if any of us will get out alive.

736
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:14,834
Never doubt what nobody is sure about.

737
00:51:15,036 --> 00:51:17,266
You can't squeeze me through that door.

738
00:51:17,472 --> 00:51:19,940
You're off your nut.
No one can get through there.

739
00:51:20,142 --> 00:51:21,507
My dear friends...

740
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:24,610
...you are now about to enter
the nerve center...

741
00:51:24,812 --> 00:51:27,076
...to the entire Wonka factory.

742
00:51:27,982 --> 00:51:32,112
Inside this room,
all of my dreams become realities.

743
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:34,343
And some of my realities become dreams.

744
00:51:34,554 --> 00:51:38,354
And almost everything you'll see
is eatable... edible.

745
00:51:38,558 --> 00:51:40,549
I mean, you can eat almost everything.

746
00:51:40,826 --> 00:51:42,350
Let me in, I'm starving!

747
00:51:42,561 --> 00:51:45,587
Don't get overexcited.
Don't lose your head.

748
00:51:45,798 --> 00:51:47,561
We wouldn't want to lose that.

749
00:51:49,667 --> 00:51:50,793
Yet.

750
00:51:51,002 --> 00:51:52,799
Now, the combination.

751
00:51:53,004 --> 00:51:54,995
This is a musical lock.

752
00:51:57,508 --> 00:51:58,701
Rachmaninoff.

753
00:51:58,909 --> 00:52:00,001
Ladies and gentlemen...

754
00:52:01,344 --> 00:52:03,005
...boys and girls...

755
00:52:04,014 --> 00:52:05,743
...the Chocolate Room.

756
00:52:43,882 --> 00:52:45,747
Hold your breath. Make a wish.

757
00:52:46,785 --> 00:52:47,979
Count to three.

758
00:52:48,787 --> 00:52:50,253
Come with me

759
00:52:50,621 --> 00:52:52,418
And you'll be

760
00:52:52,623 --> 00:52:56,286
In a world of pure imagination

761
00:52:56,727 --> 00:52:58,194
Take a look

762
00:52:58,394 --> 00:53:02,387
And you'll see into your imagination

763
00:53:09,805 --> 00:53:11,796
We'll begin

764
00:53:12,474 --> 00:53:13,839
With a spin

765
00:53:14,042 --> 00:53:17,738
Traveling in the world of my creation

766
00:53:18,246 --> 00:53:20,908
What we'll see will defy

767
00:53:23,017 --> 00:53:24,916
Explanation

768
00:53:35,928 --> 00:53:38,920
If you want to view paradise

769
00:53:39,598 --> 00:53:42,259
Simply look around and view it

770
00:53:44,035 --> 00:53:46,526
Anything you want to, do it

771
00:53:47,939 --> 00:53:49,930
Want to change the world

772
00:53:51,708 --> 00:53:53,767
There's nothing to it

773
00:54:02,518 --> 00:54:03,348
Hurry, Violet!

774
00:54:03,553 --> 00:54:05,145
This way, Grandpa!

775
00:54:11,793 --> 00:54:14,694
There is no life I know

776
00:54:14,896 --> 00:54:17,921
To compare with pure imagination

777
00:54:18,132 --> 00:54:20,566
Living there
You'll be free

778
00:54:21,569 --> 00:54:24,470
If you truly wish to be

779
00:55:06,475 --> 00:55:09,500
If you want to view paradise

780
00:55:10,511 --> 00:55:13,173
Simply look around and view it

781
00:55:14,282 --> 00:55:17,341
Anything you want to, do it

782
00:55:18,185 --> 00:55:20,745
Want to change the world

783
00:55:20,954 --> 00:55:22,945
There's nothing...

784
00:55:23,624 --> 00:55:25,682
...to it

785
00:55:36,968 --> 00:55:40,028
There is no life I know

786
00:55:42,206 --> 00:55:46,643
To compare with pure imagination

787
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,621
Living there

788
00:55:52,663 --> 00:55:54,790
You'll be free

789
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,099
If you truly...

790
00:56:01,071 --> 00:56:04,734
...wish to be

791
00:56:16,851 --> 00:56:18,614
What a disgusting, dirty river!

792
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,219
It's industrial waste.

793
00:56:20,421 --> 00:56:22,548
A ruined watershed, Wonka.
It's polluted.

794
00:56:22,757 --> 00:56:23,724
It's chocolate.

795
00:56:23,925 --> 00:56:25,221
That's chocolate?

796
00:56:25,425 --> 00:56:26,619
That's chocolate.

797
00:56:26,827 --> 00:56:28,294
A chocolate river.

798
00:56:28,495 --> 00:56:30,895
The most fantastic thing I've ever seen.

799
00:56:31,098 --> 00:56:32,759
10,000 gallons an hour.

800
00:56:32,999 --> 00:56:36,764
Look at my waterfall.
That's the most important thing.

801
00:56:37,837 --> 00:56:41,637
It's mixing my chocolate.
It's actually churning my chocolate.

802
00:56:41,841 --> 00:56:45,606
No other factory in the world
mixes chocolate by waterfall.

803
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:49,241
But it's the only way
if you want it just right.

804
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:51,846
Grandpa, look over across the river!

805
00:56:52,182 --> 00:56:53,149
Little men!

806
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:55,284
Jumping crocodiles, Charlie!

807
00:56:55,619 --> 00:56:57,450
Now we know who makes it.

808
00:56:57,688 --> 00:57:00,850
I never saw anybody
with an orange face before.

809
00:57:01,691 --> 00:57:03,591
Funny looking people.

810
00:57:03,793 --> 00:57:05,488
What are they doing?

811
00:57:05,695 --> 00:57:07,094
Creaming and sugaring time.

812
00:57:07,296 --> 00:57:10,355
- They can't be real people.
- Of course, they're real people.

813
00:57:10,632 --> 00:57:11,758
Nonsense!

814
00:57:11,967 --> 00:57:13,867
No, Oompa Loompas.

815
00:57:15,203 --> 00:57:15,999
From Loompaland.

816
00:57:16,204 --> 00:57:18,000
Loompaland?
There's no such place!

817
00:57:18,205 --> 00:57:19,672
Excuse me, dear lady...

818
00:57:19,874 --> 00:57:21,171
I teach geography.

819
00:57:21,375 --> 00:57:22,774
Then you know all about it.

820
00:57:22,977 --> 00:57:24,501
And what a terrible country it is.

821
00:57:24,712 --> 00:57:27,839
Nothing but desolate wastes
and fierce beasts.

822
00:57:28,047 --> 00:57:31,107
The poor little Oompa Loompas
were so small and helpless...

823
00:57:31,317 --> 00:57:33,615
...they would get gobbled up.

824
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:36,886
A Wangdoodle would eat
ten of them for breakfast.

825
00:57:37,723 --> 00:57:39,054
And so I said...

826
00:57:39,391 --> 00:57:42,189
"Come and live with me
in peace and safety...

827
00:57:42,394 --> 00:57:45,294
"... away from all the Wangdoodles
and Hornswogglers...

828
00:57:45,496 --> 00:57:49,023
"... and Snozzwangers
and rotten Vermicious Knids. "

829
00:57:49,233 --> 00:57:53,191
Snozzwangers? Vermicious Knids?
What kind of rubbish is that?

830
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:55,894
I'm sorry, questions
must be submitted in writing.

831
00:57:56,173 --> 00:57:58,141
So, in the greatest of secrecy...

832
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:01,867
...I transported the entire population
of Oompa Loompas here.

833
00:58:02,077 --> 00:58:05,979
I want an Oompa Loompa.
I want you to get me one right away!

834
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:08,672
All right, I'll get you one
before the day's out.

835
00:58:09,184 --> 00:58:11,550
I want an Oompa Loompa now!

836
00:58:11,753 --> 00:58:13,084
Can it, you nit!

837
00:58:13,922 --> 00:58:15,549
This is terrific.

838
00:58:15,757 --> 00:58:19,089
- Grandpa, look at Augustus.
- Don't worry, he can't drink it all.

839
00:58:19,526 --> 00:58:23,087
Augustus, sweetheart,
save some room for later.

840
00:58:23,363 --> 00:58:27,355
Don't do that! My chocolate
must never be touched by human hands.

841
00:58:28,201 --> 00:58:30,829
Don't do that!
You're contaminating my entire river!

842
00:58:31,037 --> 00:58:33,198
Please, I beg you!
Augustus!

843
00:58:34,606 --> 00:58:35,732
My chocolate!

844
00:58:35,941 --> 00:58:37,033
Help!

845
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:40,440
My chocolate!
My beautiful chocolate!

846
00:58:41,947 --> 00:58:44,244
Don't just stand there!
Do something!

847
00:58:44,448 --> 00:58:46,541
Help. Police. Murder.

848
00:58:47,952 --> 00:58:49,544
Grab this!

849
00:58:50,487 --> 00:58:52,113
What's happening to him?

850
00:58:52,388 --> 00:58:53,855
- Looks like he's drowning.
- Dive in!

851
00:58:54,057 --> 00:58:55,422
- Save him!
- It's too late.

852
00:58:55,625 --> 00:58:57,024
- Too late?
- He's had it now.

853
00:58:57,227 --> 00:58:59,718
- The suction's got him.
- Augustus, come back!

854
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:01,355
Where is he?

855
00:59:01,563 --> 00:59:02,621
Watch the pipe.

856
00:59:03,232 --> 00:59:05,393
How long is he going to stay down?

857
00:59:05,801 --> 00:59:07,962
- He can't swim!
- No better time to learn.

858
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:10,196
His coat's going up the pipe!

859
00:59:10,404 --> 00:59:11,428
Call a plumber!

860
00:59:11,639 --> 00:59:13,607
He's stuck in the pipe, isn't he?

861
00:59:13,808 --> 00:59:15,139
It's his stomach.

862
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:18,743
- He's blocking the chocolate!
- What happens now?

863
00:59:19,312 --> 00:59:23,578
The pressure will get him out.
It's building up behind the blockage.

864
00:59:24,417 --> 00:59:26,782
I wonder how long it's going to take?

865
00:59:26,986 --> 00:59:29,045
The suspense is terrible.

866
00:59:29,255 --> 00:59:30,244
I hope it'll last.

867
00:59:33,325 --> 00:59:35,121
He'll never get out.

868
00:59:35,326 --> 00:59:36,452
Yes, he will.

869
00:59:36,661 --> 00:59:39,892
Remember you once asked me
how a bullet comes out of a gun?

870
00:59:41,165 --> 00:59:43,394
He'll be marshmallows in 5 seconds!

871
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,501
- Impossible, dear lady! Unthinkable!
- Why?

872
00:59:47,271 --> 00:59:49,637
Because that pipe
goes to the Fudge Room.

873
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,171
You terrible man!

874
00:59:53,943 --> 00:59:56,571
Take Mrs. Gloop to the Fudge Room,
but look sharp...

875
00:59:56,779 --> 00:59:58,974
...or her boy will get in the boiler.

876
00:59:59,181 --> 01:00:00,909
You boiled him up!

877
01:00:01,116 --> 01:00:04,745
Nil desperandum. Across the desert
lies the promised land.

878
01:00:04,953 --> 01:00:06,318
Goodbye, Mrs. Gloop.

879
01:00:06,521 --> 01:00:11,014
Adieu! Auf wiedersehen.
Gesundheit. Farewell.

880
01:00:12,459 --> 01:00:14,757
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Do

881
01:00:14,962 --> 01:00:18,021
I've got a perfect puzzle for you

882
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:20,889
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Dee

883
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:24,662
If you are wise you'll listen to me

884
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:27,862
What do you get
when you guzzle down sweets?

885
01:00:28,206 --> 01:00:31,198
Eating as much as an elephant eats

886
01:00:31,476 --> 01:00:34,445
What are you at getting terribly fat?

887
01:00:34,646 --> 01:00:39,048
What do you think will come of that?

888
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:41,211
I don't like the look of it

889
01:00:41,419 --> 01:00:44,216
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Da

890
01:00:44,654 --> 01:00:47,555
If you're not greedy,
you will go far

891
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:50,726
You will live in happiness too

892
01:00:51,127 --> 01:00:54,721
Like the Oompa Loompa
Doompa Dee Do

893
01:01:04,672 --> 01:01:07,232
What kind of place you running here?

894
01:01:11,745 --> 01:01:12,677
What's he talking about?

895
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:33,327
Wow, what a boat!

896
01:01:33,531 --> 01:01:35,521
Looks good enough to eat!

897
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:38,159
That's a nice little canoe.

898
01:01:38,369 --> 01:01:42,396
"All I ask is a tall ship
and a star to sail her by. "

899
01:01:42,606 --> 01:01:43,664
All aboard!

900
01:01:43,874 --> 01:01:45,898
Ladies first.
That means Veruca.

901
01:01:46,109 --> 01:01:49,078
If she's a lady,
I'm a Vermicious Knid.

902
01:01:49,278 --> 01:01:52,838
- You sure this thing will float?
- With your buoyancy, rest assured.

903
01:01:53,048 --> 01:01:55,243
She's trs jolie,
but is she seaworthy?

904
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:59,011
Nothing to worry about.
I take good care of my guests.

905
01:01:59,221 --> 01:02:03,122
- You took good care of that August kid.
- Everybody aboard!

906
01:02:04,558 --> 01:02:06,423
You're going to love this.

907
01:02:06,627 --> 01:02:07,958
Just love it.

908
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:42,447
I want a boat like this. A beautiful
paddle boat, that's what I want.

909
01:02:42,659 --> 01:02:45,252
What she wants is a kick in the pants.

910
01:02:45,594 --> 01:02:46,891
I'm going to be seasick.

911
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,563
- Try one of these.
- What are they?

912
01:02:48,764 --> 01:02:51,392
Rainbow drops.
You can spit in 7 colors.

913
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,066
Spitting's a dirty habit.

914
01:02:53,268 --> 01:02:54,826
I know a worse one.

915
01:03:06,613 --> 01:03:09,446
- What business are you in?
- Nuts.

916
01:03:21,793 --> 01:03:22,691
Where are we going?

917
01:03:23,128 --> 01:03:24,891
I don't like that tunnel.

918
01:03:25,096 --> 01:03:26,393
I want off!

919
01:03:26,631 --> 01:03:31,533
Around the world and home again.
That's the sailor's way!

920
01:03:32,203 --> 01:03:34,535
I don't like this ride, Daddy!

921
01:03:38,541 --> 01:03:40,338
We're going too fast!

922
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:42,010
We're going to sink!

923
01:03:42,212 --> 01:03:44,339
- Why doesn't he stop the boat?!
- Faster!

924
01:03:44,547 --> 01:03:46,707
Close your eyes and hang on tight!

925
01:03:51,386 --> 01:03:53,717
- What is this, a freak-out?!
- This isn't funny!

926
01:03:54,222 --> 01:03:56,349
You can't possibly see
where you're going!

927
01:03:56,557 --> 01:03:58,491
You're right. I can't.

928
01:03:58,726 --> 01:04:00,660
This would make a great series!

929
01:04:02,562 --> 01:04:06,999
- This is kind of strange.
- Yes, strange, Charlie. But it's fun!

930
01:04:09,069 --> 01:04:10,899
I want to get off the boat, Wonka!

931
01:04:13,172 --> 01:04:14,139
I may get sick!

932
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:15,807
This is going too far!

933
01:04:16,008 --> 01:04:18,670
Tell that little guy to turn us around!

934
01:04:19,344 --> 01:04:20,675
Now I am going to be sick!

935
01:04:28,685 --> 01:04:32,246
There's no earthly way of knowing

936
01:04:33,524 --> 01:04:36,515
Which direction we are going

937
01:04:37,093 --> 01:04:40,927
There's no knowing where we're rowing

938
01:04:41,531 --> 01:04:44,523
Or which way the river's flowing

939
01:04:45,033 --> 01:04:47,058
Is it raining

940
01:04:47,269 --> 01:04:49,669
Is it snowing

941
01:04:49,871 --> 01:04:53,863
Is a hurricane a-blowing

942
01:04:55,609 --> 01:04:59,375
Not a speck of light is showing,
so the danger must be growing!

943
01:04:59,947 --> 01:05:02,437
Are the fires of hell a-blowing?

944
01:05:03,283 --> 01:05:05,911
Is the grizzly reaper mowing?

945
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:07,416
Yes!

946
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:12,249
The danger must be growing
for the rowers keep on rowing!

947
01:05:12,457 --> 01:05:15,449
And they're certainly not showing...

948
01:05:15,761 --> 01:05:19,628
...any signs that they are slowing!

949
01:05:24,402 --> 01:05:26,529
Make him stop, Daddy!

950
01:05:26,737 --> 01:05:28,761
- This has gone far enough!
- Quite right, sir.

951
01:05:28,972 --> 01:05:30,166
Stop the boat!

952
01:05:31,908 --> 01:05:33,603
- We're there.
- Where?

953
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:34,708
Here.

954
01:05:34,911 --> 01:05:38,573
A small step for mankind,
but a giant step for us.

955
01:05:38,914 --> 01:05:40,381
All ashore!

956
01:05:40,583 --> 01:05:42,551
Let me off this freight!

957
01:05:42,751 --> 01:05:45,776
- Why don't they show that stuff on TV?
- I don't know.

958
01:05:45,987 --> 01:05:47,045
What a nightmare!

959
01:05:47,255 --> 01:05:49,883
Daddy, I do not want a boat like this.

960
01:05:50,091 --> 01:05:50,955
"Dairy cream. "

961
01:05:51,159 --> 01:05:52,057
"Whipped cream. "

962
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:54,090
- "Coffee cream. "
- "Vanilla cream. "

963
01:05:54,995 --> 01:05:56,690
"Hair cream?"

964
01:05:59,967 --> 01:06:01,161
That's not French.

965
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:09,430
I can't take much more.

966
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:14,476
The Inventing Room.

967
01:06:15,013 --> 01:06:17,641
Now remember, no messing about.

968
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:20,578
No touching, no tasting, no telling.

969
01:06:20,784 --> 01:06:21,648
No telling what?

970
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:26,118
All of my most secret inventions
are cooking and simmering in here.

971
01:06:26,523 --> 01:06:30,253
Old Slugworth would give his false teeth
to get inside for five minutes.

972
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:33,190
So don't touch a thing!

973
01:06:58,585 --> 01:06:59,381
Inventing room?

974
01:06:59,586 --> 01:07:01,486
Looks more like a Turkish bath.

975
01:07:01,688 --> 01:07:05,145
Even if Slugworth did get in here,
he couldn't find anything.

976
01:07:05,357 --> 01:07:07,825
- You got a garbage strike?
- Who does cleaning?

977
01:07:08,027 --> 01:07:09,392
Shouldn't you wear gloves?

978
01:07:09,595 --> 01:07:11,721
You'll have health inspectors after you.

979
01:07:11,929 --> 01:07:15,729
Invention, my dear friends,
is 93% perspiration...

980
01:07:15,933 --> 01:07:17,992
...6% electricity...

981
01:07:18,202 --> 01:07:19,999
...4% evaporation...

982
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:22,501
...and 2% butterscotch ripple.

983
01:07:22,706 --> 01:07:24,901
That's one hundred and five percent!

984
01:07:25,108 --> 01:07:26,370
Any good?

985
01:07:27,811 --> 01:07:28,868
Yes.

986
01:07:29,278 --> 01:07:30,711
Excuse me.

987
01:07:33,115 --> 01:07:36,551
Time is a precious thing.
Never waste it.

988
01:07:38,386 --> 01:07:42,117
- He's absolutely bonkers!
- That's not bad.

989
01:07:44,626 --> 01:07:47,856
In springtime
The only pretty ring time

990
01:07:48,062 --> 01:07:51,088
Birds sing
Hey, ding a ding-a-ding

991
01:07:51,298 --> 01:07:53,698
Sweet lovers love...

992
01:07:54,101 --> 01:07:55,294
...the spring

993
01:07:58,371 --> 01:08:00,430
I told you not to, silly boy.

994
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:01,937
Your teeth!

995
01:08:02,141 --> 01:08:03,732
Boy, that's great stuff.

996
01:08:04,076 --> 01:08:07,603
That's exploding candy,
for your enemies. Great idea.

997
01:08:07,813 --> 01:08:10,407
Not ready yet.
Needs more gel ignite.

998
01:08:20,590 --> 01:08:21,887
What's that for?

999
01:08:22,092 --> 01:08:23,582
Gives it a little kick.

1000
01:08:26,262 --> 01:08:27,422
Wonka!

1001
01:08:29,431 --> 01:08:31,661
Butterscotch? Buttergin?

1002
01:08:31,934 --> 01:08:33,731
Something going on inside?

1003
01:08:33,936 --> 01:08:36,837
"Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker. "

1004
01:08:40,508 --> 01:08:42,908
What's the matter?
Too hot, Mr. Wonka?

1005
01:08:43,111 --> 01:08:45,136
Too cold! Far too cold.

1006
01:08:45,346 --> 01:08:47,677
That's gourmet cooking for you.

1007
01:08:48,515 --> 01:08:50,574
No! Don't, please.

1008
01:08:50,917 --> 01:08:53,681
Forgive me, but no one
must look under there.

1009
01:08:53,954 --> 01:08:56,820
This is the most secret machine
in my factory.

1010
01:08:57,189 --> 01:09:00,681
- This one's going to sizzle Slugworth.
- What's it do?

1011
01:09:02,294 --> 01:09:04,454
- Would you like to see?
- Yeah!

1012
01:09:27,984 --> 01:09:29,110
What's it do?

1013
01:09:29,318 --> 01:09:32,286
Can't you see?
It makes Everlasting Gobstoppers.

1014
01:09:32,487 --> 01:09:34,182
Everlasting Gobstoppers?

1015
01:09:34,389 --> 01:09:37,517
For children with little pocket money.
You can suck them forever.

1016
01:09:37,726 --> 01:09:39,522
I want an Everlasting Gobstopper!

1017
01:09:39,727 --> 01:09:40,694
- Me, too!
- And me!

1018
01:09:40,895 --> 01:09:43,455
Fantastic. Revolutionize the industry.

1019
01:09:43,664 --> 01:09:47,292
You suck them and they'll
never get smaller. Never...

1020
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:48,626
...I think.

1021
01:09:48,835 --> 01:09:50,860
- Few more tests.
- How do you make them?

1022
01:09:51,070 --> 01:09:54,631
I'm a trifle deaf in this ear.
Speak louder next time.

1023
01:09:54,841 --> 01:09:58,241
- Who wants an Everlasting Gobstopper?
- Me! Me! I do!

1024
01:09:59,244 --> 01:10:03,647
I can only give them to you if you
swear to keep them for yourselves.

1025
01:10:03,848 --> 01:10:07,841
And never show them
to another soul as long as you live.

1026
01:10:08,419 --> 01:10:09,147
Agreed?

1027
01:10:09,353 --> 01:10:10,320
Agreed!

1028
01:10:10,521 --> 01:10:13,978
Good. One for you,
and one for you, and one for you.

1029
01:10:14,191 --> 01:10:15,522
What about Charlie?

1030
01:10:15,859 --> 01:10:17,156
And one for Charlie.

1031
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,726
Hey, she's got two!
I want another!

1032
01:10:19,930 --> 01:10:22,727
- Stop squawking, you twit!
- Everybody has one.

1033
01:10:22,932 --> 01:10:26,424
And one is enough for anybody.
Now, come along.

1034
01:10:27,870 --> 01:10:29,565
If you'll follow me...

1035
01:10:29,838 --> 01:10:31,999
...I have something special to show you.

1036
01:10:32,207 --> 01:10:33,697
It's special, all right.

1037
01:10:34,209 --> 01:10:36,404
I only hope Veruca doesn't want one.

1038
01:10:36,611 --> 01:10:37,737
What a contraption!

1039
01:10:37,946 --> 01:10:39,003
Isn't she scrumptious?

1040
01:10:39,213 --> 01:10:42,011
My revolutionary,
non-pollutionary mechanical wonder.

1041
01:10:43,016 --> 01:10:45,541
Button, button,
who's got the button?

1042
01:10:45,953 --> 01:10:47,442
It's over there.

1043
01:10:48,054 --> 01:10:49,214
- Here?
- Yeah.

1044
01:11:05,302 --> 01:11:07,429
What you are witnessing, dear friends...

1045
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:10,607
...is the most enormous miracle
of the Machine Age.

1046
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:13,742
The creation of a confectionery giant!

1047
01:11:23,418 --> 01:11:24,817
- Finito!
- That's all?

1048
01:11:25,487 --> 01:11:27,478
Don't you know what this is?

1049
01:11:27,756 --> 01:11:29,451
- By gum, it's gum!
- Wrong!

1050
01:11:29,658 --> 01:11:32,785
It's the most fabulous,
sensational gum in the world!

1051
01:11:33,361 --> 01:11:34,726
What's so fab about it?

1052
01:11:34,929 --> 01:11:38,057
- This piece of gum is a 3-course dinner.
- Bull!

1053
01:11:38,266 --> 01:11:41,234
- Roast beef, but it's not right yet.
- I don't care!

1054
01:11:41,434 --> 01:11:43,561
I wouldn't do that.
I really wouldn't.

1055
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:45,465
If it's gum, that's for me.

1056
01:11:45,672 --> 01:11:47,730
Violet, don't do anything stupid.

1057
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:49,771
What's it taste like?

1058
01:11:50,109 --> 01:11:52,669
Madness! It's tomato soup!

1059
01:11:53,112 --> 01:11:55,841
It's creamy. I can feel it
running down my throat!

1060
01:11:56,281 --> 01:11:57,748
Stop. Don't.

1061
01:11:57,949 --> 01:11:59,473
Why doesn't she listen?

1062
01:11:59,684 --> 01:12:02,244
Because, Charlie, she's a nitwit.

1063
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:03,746
Great soup!

1064
01:12:03,955 --> 01:12:05,751
The second course is coming.

1065
01:12:05,956 --> 01:12:08,288
Roast beef and a baked potato!

1066
01:12:08,792 --> 01:12:10,521
With sour cream?

1067
01:12:12,029 --> 01:12:14,826
- What's for dessert?
- Dessert? Here it comes!

1068
01:12:15,031 --> 01:12:19,092
Blueberry pie and cream! It's
the most marvelous pie I've ever tasted!

1069
01:12:19,302 --> 01:12:21,769
- What's happening to your face?
- Cool it!

1070
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:22,994
Let me finish.

1071
01:12:23,204 --> 01:12:24,831
You're face is turning blue!

1072
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,168
- You're turning violet, Violet!
- What do you mean?

1073
01:12:28,376 --> 01:12:30,605
I told you I hadn't got it right yet.

1074
01:12:30,811 --> 01:12:33,177
Look what it's done to my kid!

1075
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:36,713
It always goes wrong when we
come to the desserts. Always.

1076
01:12:38,018 --> 01:12:39,109
What are you doing!

1077
01:12:39,319 --> 01:12:41,287
- You're blowing up!
- I feel funny!

1078
01:12:41,487 --> 01:12:43,512
- I'm not surprised.
- What's happening?!

1079
01:12:43,723 --> 01:12:45,691
- You're like a balloon!
- Like a blueberry.

1080
01:12:45,892 --> 01:12:47,825
- Call a doctor!
- Stick her with a pin.

1081
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:50,526
- She'll pop!
- It happens every time!

1082
01:12:50,729 --> 01:12:53,789
- They all become blueberries.
- You've done it this time!

1083
01:12:53,999 --> 01:12:55,523
I'll break you for this!

1084
01:12:55,734 --> 01:12:57,701
I'll get it right in the end.

1085
01:12:57,969 --> 01:12:58,697
Help!

1086
01:12:58,903 --> 01:13:01,371
We've got to let the air out of her!

1087
01:13:01,605 --> 01:13:02,799
There's no air.

1088
01:13:03,007 --> 01:13:04,531
- That's juice.
- Juice?

1089
01:13:04,742 --> 01:13:07,869
Would you roll her down
to the juicing room?

1090
01:13:08,078 --> 01:13:10,137
- What for?
- For squeezing.

1091
01:13:10,347 --> 01:13:12,713
She has to be squeezed
before she explodes.

1092
01:13:12,916 --> 01:13:15,315
- Explodes?!
- It's a fairly simple operation.

1093
01:13:16,752 --> 01:13:19,220
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Do

1094
01:13:19,421 --> 01:13:22,878
I've got another puzzle for you

1095
01:13:23,091 --> 01:13:26,254
Oompa Loompa Doompa Da Dee

1096
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:30,319
If you are wise you'll listen to me

1097
01:13:30,565 --> 01:13:33,590
Gum chewing's fine
When it's once in a while

1098
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:37,496
It stops you from smoking
And brightens your smile

1099
01:13:37,704 --> 01:13:41,002
But it's repulsive
Revolting and wrong

1100
01:13:41,207 --> 01:13:43,072
Chewing and chewing

1101
01:13:43,275 --> 01:13:45,368
All day long

1102
01:13:46,879 --> 01:13:48,869
The way that a cow does

1103
01:13:50,448 --> 01:13:53,110
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Da

1104
01:13:54,119 --> 01:13:57,110
Given good manners
You will go far

1105
01:13:57,788 --> 01:14:00,450
You will live in happiness too

1106
01:14:01,291 --> 01:14:04,749
Like the Oompa Loompa
Doompa Dee Do

1107
01:14:09,732 --> 01:14:13,099
I'll get even with you for this,
if it's the last thing I do!

1108
01:14:13,302 --> 01:14:15,895
I got a blueberry for a daughter!

1109
01:14:16,838 --> 01:14:20,638
"Where is fancy bred?
In the heart or in the head?"

1110
01:14:22,110 --> 01:14:23,633
Shall we roll on?

1111
01:14:27,915 --> 01:14:29,246
Thank you.

1112
01:14:30,084 --> 01:14:34,543
Well, well, well!
Two naughty, nasty little children gone.

1113
01:14:35,088 --> 01:14:38,489
Three good, sweet little children left.

1114
01:14:40,592 --> 01:14:43,425
Hurry, please.
Long way to go yet.

1115
01:14:46,932 --> 01:14:49,058
Wait a minute.
Must show you this.

1116
01:14:49,267 --> 01:14:51,895
Lickable wallpaper for nursery walls.

1117
01:14:52,103 --> 01:14:56,631
Lick an orange or pineapple.
It tastes like them. Try it!

1118
01:14:58,308 --> 01:15:00,276
I got a plum!

1119
01:15:00,477 --> 01:15:03,913
Grandpa, this banana's fantastic!
It tastes so real!

1120
01:15:04,147 --> 01:15:07,240
Try some more. The strawberries
taste like strawberries.

1121
01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:09,816
The snozzberries
taste like snozzberries.

1122
01:15:10,019 --> 01:15:13,182
Snozzberries?
Whoever heard of a snozzberry?

1123
01:15:14,255 --> 01:15:16,655
We are the music makers.

1124
01:15:16,991 --> 01:15:20,290
And we are the dreamers of dreams.

1125
01:15:21,429 --> 01:15:22,895
Come along.

1126
01:15:25,933 --> 01:15:28,766
Something very unusual in here.

1127
01:15:29,103 --> 01:15:32,401
Bubbles, bubbles everywhere,
but not a drop to drink.

1128
01:15:32,605 --> 01:15:33,401
Yet.

1129
01:15:33,606 --> 01:15:35,073
What's it making?

1130
01:15:35,274 --> 01:15:39,937
Fizzy-Lifting drinks. They fill you
with gas and the gas lifts you...

1131
01:15:40,145 --> 01:15:42,579
...off the ground like a balloon.

1132
01:15:42,781 --> 01:15:44,373
Isn't it high?

1133
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:46,474
But it's still too powerful.

1134
01:15:46,685 --> 01:15:47,879
Let us try some!

1135
01:15:48,619 --> 01:15:52,988
No, no. There'd be children
floating all over the place!

1136
01:15:53,190 --> 01:15:55,124
Come along, don't hang about.

1137
01:15:55,793 --> 01:15:58,192
You'll be wild about this next one.

1138
01:15:59,429 --> 01:16:01,829
Let's take a drink.
No one's watching.

1139
01:16:02,031 --> 01:16:03,794
A small one won't hurt us.

1140
01:16:09,204 --> 01:16:10,637
Not bad.

1141
01:16:12,808 --> 01:16:14,036
Well?

1142
01:16:14,309 --> 01:16:15,866
Nothing's happening.

1143
01:16:16,144 --> 01:16:19,341
You're right, Charlie.
I can't understand why!

1144
01:16:21,816 --> 01:16:23,407
I feel terribly strange.

1145
01:16:23,617 --> 01:16:26,484
- What do we do now?
- I don't know, Charlie!

1146
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:31,452
- Mr. Wonka isn't going to like this!
- We can't stay up here all day!

1147
01:16:31,657 --> 01:16:33,454
- You're right, but...
- I'll try and get down.

1148
01:16:33,659 --> 01:16:36,651
All right, Charlie,
but, please, be careful.

1149
01:16:37,663 --> 01:16:41,530
It's fun! It works!
Come on in! The air's fine!

1150
01:16:41,733 --> 01:16:44,702
- I haven't swam in 20 years.
- Give me your hand!

1151
01:16:44,903 --> 01:16:46,837
I don't think I ought to.

1152
01:16:49,506 --> 01:16:51,406
This is great!

1153
01:16:51,842 --> 01:16:53,241
Try this, Grandpa!

1154
01:16:53,577 --> 01:16:55,841
All right, Charlie.
Wait for me!

1155
01:16:59,682 --> 01:17:02,549
- I'm a shooting star!
- I'm a rocket!

1156
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:05,885
This is really great!

1157
01:17:06,087 --> 01:17:08,112
Look, I'm a bird!

1158
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:12,353
I feel light as a feather.

1159
01:17:13,195 --> 01:17:14,355
Look down.

1160
01:17:14,563 --> 01:17:16,427
We're really high now.

1161
01:17:20,601 --> 01:17:22,262
Watch this, Grandpa.

1162
01:17:25,872 --> 01:17:27,339
Wonderful, Charlie!

1163
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:29,735
- Try it, Grandpa!
- I don't know!

1164
01:17:29,943 --> 01:17:31,410
Come on, Grandpa!

1165
01:17:31,611 --> 01:17:33,100
All right.

1166
01:17:35,447 --> 01:17:37,608
Hey, you did it, Grandpa!

1167
01:17:39,051 --> 01:17:40,847
I hit an air pocket.

1168
01:17:41,052 --> 01:17:43,077
You can fly to the moon this way!

1169
01:17:43,287 --> 01:17:45,255
Let's fly south for the winter.

1170
01:17:45,456 --> 01:17:46,889
Why not?

1171
01:17:48,726 --> 01:17:49,783
I'm a bird!

1172
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:51,357
I'm a plane!

1173
01:17:51,561 --> 01:17:52,550
I'm...

1174
01:17:52,796 --> 01:17:54,627
...going too high!

1175
01:17:55,465 --> 01:17:57,729
Hey, Grandpa, I can't get down!

1176
01:17:57,967 --> 01:17:58,934
Help!

1177
01:17:59,134 --> 01:18:00,761
Grandpa, the fan!

1178
01:18:00,970 --> 01:18:03,029
Itll chop us to bits!

1179
01:18:03,239 --> 01:18:05,469
We're in trouble!
I can't stop!

1180
01:18:05,741 --> 01:18:07,037
It's pulling me in!

1181
01:18:07,242 --> 01:18:09,107
I can't stop!

1182
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:11,676
- What do we do?
- Grab hold of something!

1183
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:14,907
There's nothing to grab onto! Help!

1184
01:18:15,382 --> 01:18:16,713
We'll be killed!

1185
01:18:17,050 --> 01:18:18,677
Help! Help!

1186
01:18:18,885 --> 01:18:21,718
Mr. Wonka, please!
Turn off the fan!

1187
01:18:25,124 --> 01:18:26,887
I'm going down!

1188
01:18:27,293 --> 01:18:30,023
Burp! If you don't,
it'll cut you to ribbons!

1189
01:18:30,229 --> 01:18:32,355
- I can't! Help!
- You've got to burp!

1190
01:18:32,564 --> 01:18:34,464
It's the only way!

1191
01:18:34,733 --> 01:18:37,031
That-a-boy! Burp again!

1192
01:18:37,235 --> 01:18:39,135
That-a-boy! Come on!

1193
01:18:41,405 --> 01:18:43,566
That's wonderful, Charlie!

1194
01:18:50,079 --> 01:18:52,377
Grab on.
We're going to be all right.

1195
01:19:01,323 --> 01:19:02,517
Good boy!

1196
01:19:03,091 --> 01:19:05,457
From now on
we keep our feet on the ground.

1197
01:19:05,661 --> 01:19:07,753
Let's catch up to the others!

1198
01:19:10,431 --> 01:19:12,058
I know what you're thinking.

1199
01:19:12,266 --> 01:19:14,291
They can't be doing that.

1200
01:19:14,502 --> 01:19:16,560
But they are. They have to.

1201
01:19:16,770 --> 01:19:18,897
The Oompa Loompas can't do it.

1202
01:19:19,472 --> 01:19:21,667
The geese that lay the golden eggs!

1203
01:19:21,875 --> 01:19:24,502
They're larger than ordinary geese.

1204
01:19:24,710 --> 01:19:26,837
They're quadruple-size,
which produce...

1205
01:19:27,046 --> 01:19:30,174
...octuple-size eggs.
They're laying overtime for Easter.

1206
01:19:30,382 --> 01:19:31,713
But Easter's over!

1207
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:33,949
They don't know that.

1208
01:19:34,152 --> 01:19:36,450
I'm trying to get ahead for next year.

1209
01:19:38,056 --> 01:19:39,990
What if they drop an egg?

1210
01:19:40,491 --> 01:19:43,050
An omelet fit for a king, sir.

1211
01:19:43,393 --> 01:19:44,985
Are they chocolate eggs?

1212
01:19:45,228 --> 01:19:48,026
Golden chocolate eggs!
A great delicacy.

1213
01:19:48,231 --> 01:19:49,698
But don't get too close.

1214
01:19:49,899 --> 01:19:53,494
The geese are temperamental.
So we have the Eggdicator.

1215
01:19:53,836 --> 01:19:56,999
The Eggdicator tells the difference
between a good egg...

1216
01:19:57,673 --> 01:19:58,866
...and a bad egg.

1217
01:19:59,074 --> 01:20:02,475
If it's good, it's shined
and shipped over the world.

1218
01:20:02,844 --> 01:20:04,744
If it's a bad egg...

1219
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:07,169
...down the chute.

1220
01:20:11,418 --> 01:20:13,045
An educated Eggdicator.

1221
01:20:13,253 --> 01:20:14,845
It's a lot of nonsense.

1222
01:20:15,422 --> 01:20:18,390
A little nonsense now and then...

1223
01:20:18,591 --> 01:20:21,924
...Is relished by the wisest men.

1224
01:20:22,695 --> 01:20:24,389
I want a golden goose!

1225
01:20:24,596 --> 01:20:25,688
Here we go again.

1226
01:20:25,931 --> 01:20:27,558
All right, sweetheart.

1227
01:20:27,766 --> 01:20:29,961
You'll get one as soon as we get home.

1228
01:20:30,202 --> 01:20:32,534
No, I want one of those!

1229
01:20:33,204 --> 01:20:35,399
How much do you want for the goose?

1230
01:20:35,606 --> 01:20:37,005
- Not for sale.
- Name your price.

1231
01:20:37,208 --> 01:20:38,232
She can't have one.

1232
01:20:38,442 --> 01:20:39,739
Who says I can't?

1233
01:20:39,944 --> 01:20:41,672
- The man with the hat.
- I want one!

1234
01:20:41,878 --> 01:20:43,903
I want a golden goose!

1235
01:20:44,114 --> 01:20:45,172
Gooses!

1236
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:46,576
Geeses!

1237
01:20:46,783 --> 01:20:49,411
I want my geese to lay
gold eggs for Easter.

1238
01:20:49,619 --> 01:20:51,848
- It will, sweetheart.
- At least 100 a day.

1239
01:20:52,054 --> 01:20:55,023
- Anything you say.
- And by the way!

1240
01:20:55,224 --> 01:20:56,521
I want a feast.

1241
01:20:56,725 --> 01:20:58,420
You ate before you came.

1242
01:20:58,627 --> 01:21:00,423
I want a bean-feast

1243
01:21:00,628 --> 01:21:01,424
One of those.

1244
01:21:01,629 --> 01:21:04,530
Cream buns and doughnuts
And fruitcake with no nuts

1245
01:21:04,732 --> 01:21:07,928
- So good you could go nuts
- You'll have it when you get home.

1246
01:21:08,135 --> 01:21:11,400
No, now! I want a ball!

1247
01:21:11,638 --> 01:21:13,697
I want a party

1248
01:21:13,974 --> 01:21:15,964
Pink macaroons
And a million balloons

1249
01:21:16,242 --> 01:21:18,437
And performing baboons and...

1250
01:21:18,644 --> 01:21:19,975
...give it to me

1251
01:21:20,479 --> 01:21:21,377
Now!

1252
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:23,707
I want the world

1253
01:21:23,916 --> 01:21:26,213
I want the whole world

1254
01:21:26,418 --> 01:21:30,718
I want to lock it all up in my pocket
It's my bar of chocolate

1255
01:21:30,922 --> 01:21:33,890
Give it to me now

1256
01:21:34,091 --> 01:21:36,218
I want today

1257
01:21:36,427 --> 01:21:38,452
I want tomorrow

1258
01:21:38,662 --> 01:21:41,290
I want to wear them
Like braids in my hair

1259
01:21:41,498 --> 01:21:43,590
And I don't want to share them

1260
01:21:47,437 --> 01:21:51,065
I want a party with roomfuls of laughter

1261
01:21:51,273 --> 01:21:54,071
10,000 tons of ice cream

1262
01:21:54,276 --> 01:21:58,645
And if I don't get the things I am after

1263
01:21:58,847 --> 01:22:02,282
I'm going to scream

1264
01:22:12,692 --> 01:22:13,989
I want the works

1265
01:22:14,194 --> 01:22:15,593
I want the whole works

1266
01:22:15,795 --> 01:22:18,422
Presents and prizes
And sweets and surprises

1267
01:22:18,630 --> 01:22:21,292
Of all shapes and sizes
And now

1268
01:22:21,533 --> 01:22:25,366
Don't care how
I want it now

1269
01:22:26,037 --> 01:22:29,734
Don't care how
I want it now

1270
01:22:38,148 --> 01:22:39,877
She was a bad egg.

1271
01:22:41,384 --> 01:22:42,543
Where's she gone?

1272
01:22:42,818 --> 01:22:45,981
Where all the other bad eggs go.
Down the garbage chute.

1273
01:22:46,222 --> 01:22:48,213
The garbage chute!

1274
01:22:48,824 --> 01:22:50,189
Where does it lead to?

1275
01:22:50,392 --> 01:22:51,983
To the furnace.

1276
01:22:52,327 --> 01:22:54,158
The furnace?

1277
01:22:54,996 --> 01:22:57,794
- She'll sizzle like a sausage.
- Not necessarily.

1278
01:22:57,999 --> 01:23:00,330
She could be stuck inside the tube.

1279
01:23:00,901 --> 01:23:01,697
Hold on!

1280
01:23:01,902 --> 01:23:03,460
Veruca! Sweetheart!

1281
01:23:03,670 --> 01:23:05,501
Daddy's coming!

1282
01:23:07,974 --> 01:23:10,135
There'll be a lot of garbage today.

1283
01:23:10,343 --> 01:23:13,210
Mr. Salt finally got what he wanted.

1284
01:23:13,412 --> 01:23:15,972
- What's that?
- Veruca went first.

1285
01:23:16,182 --> 01:23:20,242
Mr. Wonka, they won't really
be burned in the furnace, will they?

1286
01:23:20,919 --> 01:23:23,820
I think that furnace is lit
only every other day.

1287
01:23:24,022 --> 01:23:26,581
So they have a good sporting chance.

1288
01:23:27,358 --> 01:23:30,816
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Do

1289
01:23:31,028 --> 01:23:34,485
I've got another puzzle for you

1290
01:23:34,697 --> 01:23:37,757
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Dee

1291
01:23:38,268 --> 01:23:41,704
If you are wise you'll listen to me

1292
01:23:41,938 --> 01:23:45,236
Who do you blame
When your kid is a brat

1293
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:48,739
Pampered and spoiled
Like a Siamese cat

1294
01:23:48,944 --> 01:23:52,174
Blaming the kids
Is a lie and a shame

1295
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:54,245
You know exactly

1296
01:23:54,448 --> 01:23:56,507
Who's to blame

1297
01:23:57,218 --> 01:23:59,708
The mother and the father

1298
01:24:01,888 --> 01:24:04,118
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Da

1299
01:24:04,558 --> 01:24:08,016
If you're not spoiled
Then you will go far

1300
01:24:08,228 --> 01:24:12,163
You will live in happiness too

1301
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:17,457
Like the Oompa Loompa
Doompa Dee Do

1302
01:24:18,903 --> 01:24:21,701
The children are
disappearing like rabbits!

1303
01:24:21,906 --> 01:24:25,034
We still have each other.
Shall we press on?

1304
01:24:25,243 --> 01:24:27,210
Can't we sit down for a minute?

1305
01:24:27,411 --> 01:24:31,575
- The pace is killing me.
- Transportation has been arranged.

1306
01:24:36,252 --> 01:24:38,379
Behold the Wonkamobile!

1307
01:24:38,588 --> 01:24:40,556
"A thing of beauty is a joy forever. "

1308
01:24:40,756 --> 01:24:43,588
Places, please.
The dance is about to begin.

1309
01:24:43,858 --> 01:24:46,383
Grab a seat, they're going fast!

1310
01:24:46,595 --> 01:24:49,063
What's that they're filling it up with?

1311
01:24:49,264 --> 01:24:52,061
Ginger ale, ginger pop,
ginger beer, beer bubbles...

1312
01:24:52,266 --> 01:24:55,565
...bubble cola, double cola,
double-bubble burp-a-cola...

1313
01:24:55,769 --> 01:24:58,738
...that carbonated stuff
that tickles your nose.

1314
01:24:58,939 --> 01:25:01,839
Few people realize the power
in one of those things.

1315
01:25:02,108 --> 01:25:03,973
I'm sorry I asked.

1316
01:25:04,210 --> 01:25:07,236
Would Slugworth pay extra
to know about this?

1317
01:25:07,447 --> 01:25:10,381
Just keep your eyes open
and your mouth shut.

1318
01:25:11,883 --> 01:25:13,077
Everybody set?

1319
01:25:13,285 --> 01:25:14,582
Will this go fast?

1320
01:25:14,786 --> 01:25:17,583
It should. It's got more gas
than a politician!

1321
01:25:17,788 --> 01:25:21,724
Hold on. I'm going to open her up
and see what she can do.

1322
01:25:29,799 --> 01:25:31,790
Swifter than eagles...

1323
01:25:32,068 --> 01:25:34,127
...stronger than lions.

1324
01:25:42,077 --> 01:25:43,976
It's getting in my eyes!

1325
01:25:44,412 --> 01:25:46,277
It's seeping in my shoes!

1326
01:25:46,481 --> 01:25:49,143
I'm soaked!
Itll never come out!

1327
01:25:49,651 --> 01:25:50,982
It's sticking to my gun!

1328
01:25:59,493 --> 01:26:02,928
My dress! My hair! My face!

1329
01:26:03,996 --> 01:26:06,829
I'm sending you
the cleaning bill, Mr. Wonka!

1330
01:26:09,934 --> 01:26:11,799
I'm dry cleaned!

1331
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:16,866
Hey, Grandpa...

1332
01:26:17,075 --> 01:26:19,372
...what was that we just went through?

1333
01:26:19,576 --> 01:26:20,941
Hsaw Aknow.

1334
01:26:21,145 --> 01:26:24,114
- Is that Japanese?
- No, Wonka Wash spelled backwards.

1335
01:26:24,314 --> 01:26:26,440
That's it. The journey's over.

1336
01:26:26,649 --> 01:26:28,947
Finest bath I've had in twenty years!

1337
01:26:29,152 --> 01:26:30,551
Let's do it again!

1338
01:26:30,753 --> 01:26:34,086
- That's as far as it goes?
- Couldn't we have walked?

1339
01:26:34,590 --> 01:26:38,787
If the Lord meant for us to walk
He wouldn't have invented roller-skates.

1340
01:26:38,994 --> 01:26:40,791
Would you put these on?

1341
01:26:40,996 --> 01:26:43,260
We have to be careful.

1342
01:26:43,764 --> 01:26:46,096
There's dangerous stuff inside.

1343
01:26:48,836 --> 01:26:50,030
Wonkavision!

1344
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:52,704
My very latest and greatest invention.

1345
01:26:53,273 --> 01:26:55,639
- It's television!
- It's Wonkavision.

1346
01:26:55,842 --> 01:26:58,902
You all know how
ordinary television works.

1347
01:26:59,112 --> 01:27:01,409
I do! You photograph something...

1348
01:27:01,613 --> 01:27:04,241
...then it's split
into millions of pieces...

1349
01:27:04,450 --> 01:27:08,386
...that fly through the air and arrive
at your TV set in the right order.

1350
01:27:09,188 --> 01:27:12,281
You should open your mouth
a little wider when you speak.

1351
01:27:12,523 --> 01:27:15,151
If they can do it with a photograph...

1352
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:17,452
...why not a bar of chocolate?

1353
01:27:20,363 --> 01:27:24,766
I shall now send this chocolate bar
from one end of the room to the other.

1354
01:27:24,968 --> 01:27:28,368
It has to be big, because
when you transmit by television...

1355
01:27:28,637 --> 01:27:30,195
...it always ends up smaller.

1356
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:32,701
Goggles on, please.

1357
01:27:34,877 --> 01:27:36,969
Lights... camera...

1358
01:27:37,178 --> 01:27:38,372
...action!

1359
01:27:40,148 --> 01:27:41,877
You can remove your goggles.

1360
01:27:42,717 --> 01:27:43,944
Where's the chocolate?

1361
01:27:44,151 --> 01:27:46,381
It's flying over our heads
in a million pieces.

1362
01:27:49,223 --> 01:27:50,884
Now watch the screen.

1363
01:27:53,726 --> 01:27:55,057
Here it comes.

1364
01:27:56,329 --> 01:27:57,796
There it is.

1365
01:27:58,164 --> 01:27:59,153
Take it.

1366
01:27:59,432 --> 01:28:01,023
How? It's just a picture.

1367
01:28:01,233 --> 01:28:02,564
All right, you take it.

1368
01:28:04,002 --> 01:28:04,866
It's real!

1369
01:28:05,070 --> 01:28:05,968
Taste it!

1370
01:28:06,171 --> 01:28:08,071
It's just gotten smaller.

1371
01:28:10,407 --> 01:28:11,374
It's perfect!

1372
01:28:11,575 --> 01:28:12,542
Unbelievable!

1373
01:28:12,743 --> 01:28:13,471
A miracle!

1374
01:28:13,677 --> 01:28:14,541
A TV dinner!

1375
01:28:14,745 --> 01:28:15,541
It's Wonkavision.

1376
01:28:15,746 --> 01:28:17,213
It could change the world!

1377
01:28:17,414 --> 01:28:19,210
Can you send other things?

1378
01:28:19,415 --> 01:28:21,474
- Not just chocolate.
- Anything you like.

1379
01:28:21,684 --> 01:28:23,015
What about people?

1380
01:28:23,253 --> 01:28:24,686
People?

1381
01:28:26,089 --> 01:28:28,818
I don't really know.
I suppose I could.

1382
01:28:29,024 --> 01:28:32,050
Yes, I'm sure I could.
I'm pretty sure I could.

1383
01:28:32,261 --> 01:28:33,888
But it might have messy results.

1384
01:28:34,096 --> 01:28:37,326
I'm going to be the first person
to be sent by television!

1385
01:28:37,532 --> 01:28:38,590
Get away!

1386
01:28:38,933 --> 01:28:40,230
Stop. Don't. Come back.

1387
01:28:40,434 --> 01:28:42,095
Lights... camera... action!

1388
01:28:46,206 --> 01:28:47,571
Where are you?

1389
01:28:47,774 --> 01:28:50,004
He's up there, in a million pieces.

1390
01:28:50,210 --> 01:28:53,770
- Mike, are you there?
- No good shouting. Watch the screen.

1391
01:28:56,949 --> 01:28:59,247
Mike? Why is he taking so long?

1392
01:28:59,451 --> 01:29:01,509
A million pieces
take time to put together.

1393
01:29:01,719 --> 01:29:04,415
- Where are they?
- There's something coming through.

1394
01:29:04,622 --> 01:29:07,386
- Is it Mike?
- It's hard to tell, but...

1395
01:29:08,226 --> 01:29:10,318
The little groover's getting smaller.

1396
01:29:10,561 --> 01:29:14,759
Look at me! I'm the first person
in the world to be sent by television!

1397
01:29:15,532 --> 01:29:17,932
Wow, what a wild trip that was!

1398
01:29:18,135 --> 01:29:20,694
It's the greatest thing
that's ever happened!

1399
01:29:20,903 --> 01:29:24,066
Am I coming in clear?
I said, am I coming in clear?

1400
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:26,608
Great. He's completely unharmed.

1401
01:29:26,809 --> 01:29:28,935
You call that unharmed?!

1402
01:29:29,144 --> 01:29:32,113
Wow! That was something!
Can I do it again?

1403
01:29:32,781 --> 01:29:33,941
There'll be nothing!

1404
01:29:34,149 --> 01:29:36,275
Don't worry, Mom.
I feel fine.

1405
01:29:36,483 --> 01:29:38,451
I'm famous! I'm a TV star!

1406
01:29:38,652 --> 01:29:40,711
Wait till the kids hear!

1407
01:29:40,921 --> 01:29:42,218
No one will hear!

1408
01:29:42,423 --> 01:29:43,856
Where are you taking me?

1409
01:29:44,091 --> 01:29:45,557
I don't want to go in there!

1410
01:29:45,758 --> 01:29:46,986
Be quiet!

1411
01:29:47,327 --> 01:29:48,419
Well?

1412
01:29:49,095 --> 01:29:52,792
Fortunately, small boys
are extremely springy and elastic.

1413
01:29:52,998 --> 01:29:56,798
So, I think we'll put him in my
special taffy-pulling machine.

1414
01:29:57,002 --> 01:29:58,560
To the Taffy-Pulling Room.

1415
01:29:58,770 --> 01:30:02,535
The boy is in his mother's purse.
But be careful.

1416
01:30:04,508 --> 01:30:06,442
What's he saying?

1417
01:30:06,677 --> 01:30:09,271
No, I won't hold you responsible.

1418
01:30:10,513 --> 01:30:14,244
And now, my dearest lady,
it's time to say good-bye.

1419
01:30:14,451 --> 01:30:16,248
No, no! Don't speak!

1420
01:30:16,453 --> 01:30:20,684
For some moments in life,
there are no words. Run along now.

1421
01:30:27,196 --> 01:30:28,025
Adieu.

1422
01:30:29,697 --> 01:30:32,359
"Parting is such sweet sorrow. "

1423
01:30:41,375 --> 01:30:44,367
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Do

1424
01:30:44,977 --> 01:30:47,810
I've got another puzzle for you

1425
01:30:48,514 --> 01:30:51,176
Oompa Loompa Doompa Da Dee

1426
01:30:52,184 --> 01:30:54,845
If you are wise you'll listen to me

1427
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:58,416
What do you get from a glut of TV?

1428
01:30:58,623 --> 01:31:01,854
A pain in the neck and an IQ of 3

1429
01:31:02,359 --> 01:31:05,351
Why don't you try simply reading a book?

1430
01:31:05,863 --> 01:31:08,423
Or could you just not bear to look?

1431
01:31:08,632 --> 01:31:10,122
You'll get no

1432
01:31:13,202 --> 01:31:15,796
You'll get no commercials

1433
01:31:16,205 --> 01:31:19,867
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Da

1434
01:31:20,709 --> 01:31:23,371
If you like reading you will go far

1435
01:31:24,813 --> 01:31:27,475
You will live in happiness too

1436
01:31:28,549 --> 01:31:29,811
Like the...

1437
01:31:30,217 --> 01:31:31,377
...Oompa...

1438
01:31:32,219 --> 01:31:34,983
...Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Do!

1439
01:31:38,925 --> 01:31:43,362
So much to do, so much to do.
Invoices, bills, letters.

1440
01:31:43,863 --> 01:31:46,353
I must answer that note from the queen.

1441
01:31:47,199 --> 01:31:49,326
What will happen to the others?

1442
01:31:50,936 --> 01:31:51,960
My dear boy...

1443
01:31:52,204 --> 01:31:54,228
...they'll be quite all right.

1444
01:31:54,439 --> 01:31:59,376
When they leave here they'll be restored
to their normal, terrible old selves.

1445
01:31:59,944 --> 01:32:02,571
But maybe a little wiser for the wear.

1446
01:32:02,779 --> 01:32:04,246
Don't worry.

1447
01:32:04,448 --> 01:32:06,882
What do we do now, Mr. Wonka?

1448
01:32:07,284 --> 01:32:11,515
I hope you enjoyed yourselves.
Excuse me for not showing you out.

1449
01:32:11,721 --> 01:32:13,586
Up the stairs. I'm busy.

1450
01:32:13,789 --> 01:32:16,724
A whole day wasted.
Good-bye to you both.

1451
01:32:20,295 --> 01:32:23,787
What happened?
Did we do something wrong?

1452
01:32:24,065 --> 01:32:25,965
I don't know, Charlie.

1453
01:32:26,568 --> 01:32:28,626
But I'm going to find out.

1454
01:32:46,985 --> 01:32:49,283
I am extraordinarily busy, sir.

1455
01:32:49,488 --> 01:32:51,979
I wanted to ask about the chocolate.

1456
01:32:52,424 --> 01:32:55,824
The lifetime supply of chocolate?
For Charlie.

1457
01:32:56,327 --> 01:32:57,794
When does he get it?

1458
01:32:57,995 --> 01:33:00,122
- He doesn't.
- Why not?

1459
01:33:00,331 --> 01:33:02,458
Because he broke the rules.

1460
01:33:02,665 --> 01:33:05,463
What rules?
We didn't see any rules, did we?

1461
01:33:05,668 --> 01:33:07,727
Wrong, sir! Wrong!

1462
01:33:07,937 --> 01:33:11,394
Under Section 37-B of the
contract signed by him...

1463
01:33:11,607 --> 01:33:15,668
...it states clearly that all offers
shall become null and void if...

1464
01:33:15,944 --> 01:33:18,913
...and you can read it
for yourself in this copy:

1465
01:33:19,114 --> 01:33:20,580
"I, the undersigned...

1466
01:33:20,782 --> 01:33:23,649
"... shall forfeit all rights,
privileges and licenses...

1467
01:33:23,851 --> 01:33:25,978
"... herein contained," et cetera...

1468
01:33:26,187 --> 01:33:27,154
"... fax mentis...

1469
01:33:27,355 --> 01:33:30,323
"... incendium gloria culpam,"
et cetera, et cetera.

1470
01:33:30,524 --> 01:33:33,152
"Memo bis punitor della cattum!"

1471
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:36,659
It's all there! Black and white!
Clear as crystal!

1472
01:33:36,863 --> 01:33:39,092
You stole Fizzy-Lifting drinks!

1473
01:33:39,298 --> 01:33:42,927
You bumped into the ceiling
which now has to be sterilized!

1474
01:33:43,135 --> 01:33:45,160
So you get nothing!

1475
01:33:45,371 --> 01:33:46,667
You lose!

1476
01:33:46,871 --> 01:33:49,032
Good day, sir!

1477
01:33:49,808 --> 01:33:51,207
You're a crook!

1478
01:33:51,643 --> 01:33:54,338
A cheat and a swindler,
that's what you are!

1479
01:33:54,545 --> 01:33:56,513
How can you do this?!

1480
01:33:56,713 --> 01:34:00,342
Build up a little boy's hopes and
then smash his dreams to pieces!

1481
01:34:00,551 --> 01:34:02,348
You're an inhuman monster!

1482
01:34:02,553 --> 01:34:04,816
I said, "Good day"!

1483
01:34:08,558 --> 01:34:11,049
Come on, Charlie.
Let's get out of here.

1484
01:34:11,726 --> 01:34:14,354
I'll get even,
if it's the last thing I do.

1485
01:34:14,563 --> 01:34:17,498
If Slugworth wants a Gobstopper,
he'll get one.

1486
01:34:50,361 --> 01:34:52,886
"So shines a good deed...

1487
01:34:53,097 --> 01:34:55,428
"... in a weary world. "

1488
01:34:59,402 --> 01:35:01,029
My boy.

1489
01:35:01,705 --> 01:35:03,002
You've won!

1490
01:35:03,205 --> 01:35:05,070
You did it! You did it!

1491
01:35:05,274 --> 01:35:08,539
I knew you would!
I just knew you would!

1492
01:35:09,778 --> 01:35:12,575
Forgive me for putting you through this.

1493
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:15,908
Come in, Mr. Wilkinson.
Charlie, meet Mr. Wilkinson.

1494
01:35:16,117 --> 01:35:17,345
- Pleasure.
- Slugworth!

1495
01:35:17,552 --> 01:35:20,077
That's not Slugworth!
He works for me!

1496
01:35:20,288 --> 01:35:22,585
- For you?
- I had to test you, Charlie.

1497
01:35:22,789 --> 01:35:25,781
And you passed the test.
You won!

1498
01:35:26,059 --> 01:35:28,186
- Won what?
- The jackpot, my dear sir!

1499
01:35:28,395 --> 01:35:31,022
- The grand and glorious jackpot!
- The chocolate?

1500
01:35:31,230 --> 01:35:34,597
The chocolate, yes.
But, that's just the beginning!

1501
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:38,257
We have so much time
and so little to do!

1502
01:35:38,470 --> 01:35:40,370
Strike that. Reverse it.

1503
01:35:40,572 --> 01:35:42,335
This way, please!

1504
01:35:42,741 --> 01:35:44,800
We'll take the Wonkavator.

1505
01:35:45,577 --> 01:35:48,067
Step in, Charlie.
Grandpa Joe, sir.

1506
01:35:55,919 --> 01:35:59,878
- This is the great glass Wonkavator.
- It's an elevator.

1507
01:36:00,089 --> 01:36:02,455
A Wonkavator.
An elevator goes up and down.

1508
01:36:02,659 --> 01:36:05,786
But the Wonkavator goes
sideways, slantways, backways...

1509
01:36:05,994 --> 01:36:07,291
And frontways?

1510
01:36:07,496 --> 01:36:09,464
...and any ways you can think of.

1511
01:36:09,998 --> 01:36:14,297
It can take you to any room by pressing
one of these buttons. Any button.

1512
01:36:14,502 --> 01:36:17,164
Press a button and zing!
You're off.

1513
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:20,430
And up until now,
I've pressed them all.

1514
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:22,273
Except one.

1515
01:36:23,109 --> 01:36:23,973
This one.

1516
01:36:25,345 --> 01:36:26,744
Go ahead, Charlie.

1517
01:36:26,947 --> 01:36:28,175
Me?

1518
01:36:30,849 --> 01:36:32,111
There it goes!

1519
01:36:34,286 --> 01:36:35,617
Hold on tight!

1520
01:36:36,121 --> 01:36:38,953
I'm not exactly sure
what's going to happen.

1521
01:36:39,691 --> 01:36:43,149
Faster! If we don't pick up speed,
we won't get through.

1522
01:36:43,361 --> 01:36:44,794
Through what?

1523
01:36:45,630 --> 01:36:47,494
- You mean, we're going..?
- Up and out.

1524
01:36:47,698 --> 01:36:50,633
This roof is glass.
It'll shatter in 1,000 pieces!

1525
01:36:50,867 --> 01:36:53,301
- We'll be cut to ribbons!
- Probably.

1526
01:36:57,039 --> 01:36:58,700
Hold on, everybody!

1527
01:36:59,875 --> 01:37:02,241
Here it comes!

1528
01:37:17,324 --> 01:37:21,157
- You did it! Congratulations!
- Get up, take a look.

1529
01:37:21,894 --> 01:37:23,521
Our town looks so pretty.

1530
01:37:23,730 --> 01:37:25,027
Look over here, Charlie.

1531
01:37:25,231 --> 01:37:26,892
I think I see our house.

1532
01:37:29,235 --> 01:37:30,633
It really looks beautiful.

1533
01:37:30,836 --> 01:37:32,360
There's my school!

1534
01:37:38,909 --> 01:37:41,002
How did you like the chocolate factory?

1535
01:37:41,345 --> 01:37:44,143
It's the most wonderful place
in the world.

1536
01:37:44,348 --> 01:37:46,373
I'm pleased to hear you say that...

1537
01:37:46,584 --> 01:37:48,881
...because I'm giving it to you.

1538
01:37:50,020 --> 01:37:52,318
- What?
- That's all right, isn't it?

1539
01:37:52,522 --> 01:37:55,184
- You're giving Charlie the...
- I can't go on forever.

1540
01:37:55,425 --> 01:37:57,449
And I don't really want to try.

1541
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:02,697
Who can I trust to run the factory, and
take care of the Oompa Loompas for me?

1542
01:38:02,931 --> 01:38:04,227
Not a grown-up.

1543
01:38:04,432 --> 01:38:07,595
A grown-up would do
everything his way, not mine.

1544
01:38:07,935 --> 01:38:11,564
That's why I decided long ago
that I had to find a child.

1545
01:38:11,773 --> 01:38:13,433
A very honest...

1546
01:38:13,774 --> 01:38:15,207
...loving child...

1547
01:38:15,709 --> 01:38:19,076
...to whom I can tell all my
precious candy-making secrets.

1548
01:38:19,279 --> 01:38:21,803
- That's why you sent the Golden Tickets.
- That's right.

1549
01:38:22,048 --> 01:38:24,539
The factory's yours.
You can move in immediately.

1550
01:38:24,784 --> 01:38:26,775
- And me?
- Absolutely.

1551
01:38:27,219 --> 01:38:29,414
- What happens to the rest...
- The whole family.

1552
01:38:29,622 --> 01:38:31,452
I want you to bring them all.

1553
01:38:35,126 --> 01:38:36,559
But Charlie...

1554
01:38:37,729 --> 01:38:41,425
...don't forget what happened to the man
who got everything he wanted.

1555
01:38:41,632 --> 01:38:42,690
What happened?

1556
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:45,232
He lived happily ever after.
