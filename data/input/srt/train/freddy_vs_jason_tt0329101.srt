1
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,993
My children...

2
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,159
from the very beginning...

3
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,728
it was the children
who gave me my power.

4
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:41,832
The Springwood Slasher...

5
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,866
that's what they called me.

6
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:11,294
My reign of terror
was legendary.

7
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:15,501
Dozens of children
would fall by my blades.

8
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:22,938
Then the parents of Springwood
came for me...

9
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:32,955
taking justice
into their own hands.

10
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:39,158
When I was alive, I might
have been a little naughty...

11
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,996
but after they killed me,

12
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:44,492
I became something much,
much worse--

13
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:47,665
the stuff nightmares
are made of.

14
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,275
The children
still feared me...

15
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,406
and their fear gave me the power
to invade their dreams.

16
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:58,816
And that's when the fun
really began!

17
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:07,593
Until they figured out
a way to forget about me...

18
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,653
to erase me completely!

19
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,494
Being dead wasn't a problem.

20
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:15,763
But being forgotten--
now, that's a bitch!

21
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,003
It's only a dream!

22
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,530
Die, motherfucker!

23
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:25,806
I can't come back
if nobody remembers me!

24
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:30,179
I can't come back
if nobody's afraid!

25
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:38,051
I had to search the bowels
of hell...

26
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,992
but I found someone...

27
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:44,793
someone
who'll make 'em remember.

28
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:49,495
He may get the blood,
but I'll get the glory.

29
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:54,030
And that fear is my ticket home.

30
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,535
Mike?

31
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:00,311
Is that you?

32
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:05,948
All right, fuck you, then.

33
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:06,974
I'm heading in.

34
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,927
Mike?

35
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,995
Come on, it's not funny anymore.

36
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,053
No!

37
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,500
Jason.

38
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:14,111
I should've been watching
them, not drinking...

39
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,138
not meeting a boy
at the lake.

40
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,944
I deserve to be punished.

41
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,477
We all deserved
to be punished.

42
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,218
Jason.

43
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,288
My special, special boy.

44
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,696
Do you know what
your gift is?

45
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,290
No matter what they do to you...

46
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,461
you cannot die.

47
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,993
You can never die.

48
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,565
You've just been
sleeping, honey.

49
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:47,671
But now the time
has come to wake up.

50
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:51,875
Mommy has something
she wants you to do.

51
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,147
I need you to go
to Elm Street.

52
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:00,922
The children have been
very bad on Elm Street.

53
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,588
Rise up, Jason!

54
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,928
Your work isn't finished!

55
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:10,800
Hear my voice and live again!

56
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:24,173
Make them remember me, Jason.

57
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,277
Make them remember
what fear tastes like.

58
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:34,683
I've been away from my children
for far too long.

59
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,836
Marry, fuck, or kill?
Your choices are--

60
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,428
your choices
are the Three Stooges.

61
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:20,632
Go, Kia.

62
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:23,005
Oh, God...

63
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:26,170
Which one had
the super-bad toupee hair?

64
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,271
Harry, Mar--

65
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,111
No! No, no, no.
It was Moe.

66
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:33,016
Either one, I'd kill him.

67
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,144
OK, who'd you fuck, then?

68
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,484
This is stupid, y'all.

69
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,284
Come on. Come on.

70
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:38,449
Oh, God. Whatever, look.

71
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,981
I'd fuck the bald guy,
and I'd marry Larry.

72
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,256
Jesus. Is this what
we're doing all night?

73
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,661
'Cause, y'all,
this is really stank.

74
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,961
Hey! Gibb, what are you doing?

75
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,023
I thought you were gonna quit.

76
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,625
I only smoke when I drink now.

77
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,296
But you're always drinking.

78
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,964
Yeah, well, I'll work
on that next.

79
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,470
Hey, OK.

80
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:56,475
I got another one.

81
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,307
Fred, Scooby, or Shaggy?

82
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,711
Oh! I'm not answering that
and neither is she.

83
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:04,545
Do you guys think
I should get a nose job?

84
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,778
Oh, my God.

85
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,446
Oh, please, Kia, what you need
is a lobotomy.

86
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:13,118
I think I'm gonna
get some candles.

87
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,788
I'm gonna get some beer.
Do you guys want anything?

88
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,794
Are you sure you
should be driving?

89
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,630
I'm so under the limit, Lori.

90
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,096
Surprise.

91
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,764
Oh, Trey.
You answered my prayers.

92
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:27,795
Thank you.

93
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:29,775
Whoa, babe!

94
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:30,935
What'd I tell you
about kissing me...

95
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,274
after you've smoked, huh?

96
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:33,938
Lighten up.
They're menthols.

97
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,278
Yeah. I brought Blake.
Where's Linda?

98
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:37,714
It's Lori.

99
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,116
This is her house,
so don't be a total cocksmith.

100
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,141
Whatever.

101
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,982
Where are the ladies?

102
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,721
Relax, they'll be here.

103
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:50,285
I'm relaxed, man.
I'm just wet.

104
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,126
Did you know they
were coming over?

105
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,632
Listen, you gotta be quiet.

106
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,965
Hey, we knew you were be here
all alone this weekend.

107
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,972
Blake's cute.

108
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,872
He's not my type.

109
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,308
Oh! Who is? No one's
ever gonna live up...

110
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:07,335
to the fuzzy memory
of your first love, Lori.

111
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,177
You were fucking fourteen,
so get over it.

112
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,739
Yeah, I know
we were young...

113
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,876
but what Will and l
had was real.

114
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,910
Well, correct me if I'm wrong...

115
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,616
but didn't Mr. Real
just drop-kick your ass...

116
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,557
without so much
as a good-bye handshake?

117
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:23,289
He ever even call or maybe even
write to you after he moved?

118
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,591
Send you an e-mail?

119
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,961
No.

120
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,057
You see my point?

121
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,295
It's time to leave
the convent, Lori.

122
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,065
You need to meet a guy.

123
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,219
Hey, Lori...

124
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,523
I like the...
flow of your place.

125
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,495
Got good feng shui.

126
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,395
Yeah.

127
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,498
You know about feng shui?

128
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,907
Oh, oh!

129
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:11,910
Oh, you should see her bedroom!

130
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,742
-Hmm?
-Great flow in there.

131
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,510
Lori, why don't you go upstairs
and show Blake your feng shui?

132
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,881
Shut up!

133
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,847
I got a kink in my neck.

134
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:26,551
Come on.
You can massage it out for me.

135
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,918
I think I need
a few more drinks...

136
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,226
before there'll be
any massaging.

137
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,195
What do you see in him?

138
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:38,169
I don't know,
but he has a cute ass.

139
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:41,605
Babe, don't make me
ask you twice, OK?

140
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,142
So, Lori...

141
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,206
am I gonna get that
grand tour or what?

142
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,548
Yeah.

143
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,110
You know, why don't you
start in the kitchen...

144
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,314
and get us some beers?

145
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,720
Cool.

146
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,124
Oh, my God, Kia,
he is a total idiot.

147
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,152
Get him out of here.

148
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:07,461
Oh, Lori, come on,
give him a chance.

149
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,660
I don't like him.

150
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,669
You know what?
You don't like anybody.

151
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,432
I mean, Lori, you've
barely gone out since--

152
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:14,598
Since what?
Since my mom died?

153
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,335
Yeah, well, you know what?
My dad needs me.

154
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,366
So I can't just go out
with guys all the time...

155
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:21,710
and if I did, it would not be
with somebody like Blake.

156
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,316
Yeah, fuck me, baby!

157
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,272
Your back door was open.

158
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:22,399
I closed it.

159
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:23,874
Mmm.

160
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:28,346
Babe, you know I don't like
to be touched after, OK?

161
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,042
Fine. I'll go have
a shower then.

162
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:35,351
Good.

163
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,719
Your hair smells like
menthols, anyway.

164
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,452
Asshole.

165
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:38,214
Trey!

166
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,083
What the hell are you doing?

167
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,897
Help us! Help us!

168
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,637
Oh, my God!

169
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,907
Over here!

170
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,846
Please help us!

171
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:09,848
Help us!

172
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,213
You kids need
some assistance?

173
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,343
What the fuck
do you think?!

174
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,285
We need to lock this down now.

175
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,845
Keep it contained, you hear me?

176
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,413
Killed in bed.

177
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:21,187
Jesus.

178
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,661
It's even the same damn house.

179
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,186
1428 Elm.

180
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,062
It's gotta be him, right?

181
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,657
It's gotta be
Freddy Krueger.

182
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,668
Hey! Don't even say...

183
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,669
that son of a bitch's
name out loud.

184
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,898
Let's just keep it together.

185
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,406
We've been through too much
to let this thing spread now.

186
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,931
Take all the kids
down to the station.

187
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,500
Keep them separate.
Do it now.

188
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,943
Yes, sir.

189
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,241
We'll be in touch.

190
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,271
Thank you.
Let's go home.

191
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:49,452
So?

192
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:50,716
She doesn't know anything.

193
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:53,247
None of them do.

194
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,384
I'm pretty sure we're good.

195
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,485
Pretty sure?
You better make damn sure...

196
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:57,688
none of those kids
knows anything...

197
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,096
or I'll send your ass up
to Westin Hills with them.

198
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,531
Knows what?
What do you mean?

199
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,501
Good work there tonight, Stubbs.

200
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,628
Right place, right time.

201
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,571
But we'll take it
from here, all right?

202
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,546
Your father's on his way.

203
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,709
Do they know who did this?

204
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,810
No, not yet.

205
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:21,979
But I thought I heard...

206
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,716
one of the officers
mention a name.

207
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,348
You know, to tell
you the truth, Lori...

208
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,586
I--I just moved here
about a month ago...

209
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:30,026
but if they have a suspect,
I'd be the first to know.

210
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,825
But they asked me all these
really weird questions...

211
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,161
Iike about my dreams--

212
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,436
What was the name?

213
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,202
What was the name?

214
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,980
Freddy.

215
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,269
Hello?

216
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,050
Are you OK?

217
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:15,931
His name is Freddy Krueger...

218
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:21,736
and he loves children,
especially little girls.

219
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,368
Freddy's coming back.

220
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,038
Soon he'll be strong enough.

221
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,412
It's OK to be afraid.

222
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,542
We were all afraid.

223
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:36,076
Warn your friends.
Warn everyone.

224
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:50,424
One, two, Freddy's
coming for you

225
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:54,235
Three, four,
better lock the door

226
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:58,607
Five, six, grab a crucifix

227
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:02,478
Seven, eight,
try to stay up late

228
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:06,610
Nine, ten, never sleep again

229
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:11,180
One, two, Freddy's
coming for you...

230
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:21,821
Blake, we have to talk.

231
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,164
What the hell were you
doing over there?

232
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:30,573
You were supposed to be
watching your sister.

233
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,134
Were you drinking?

234
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:36,147
My best friend was
just killed, Dad!

235
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:39,878
So how about giving me
some fucking space?

236
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,814
You watch yourself, boy.

237
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:59,136
I'm gonna get him for you, Trey.

238
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,503
Cop let it slip.

239
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,098
It was somebody named Freddy.

240
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,236
I'm gonna take him out
myself, Trey.

241
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,577
I swear to God.

242
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,126
Who is that?

243
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,963
Someone there?

244
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:39,369
Jesus.

245
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:50,915
I'm OK. I'm all right.

246
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,659
Not strong enough yet.

247
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:01,188
Well, I will be soon enough.

248
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,498
Until then...

249
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,733
I'll let Jason have some fun.

250
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,211
Dad?

251
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,970
Hypnocil.
What does this shit do, anyway?

252
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,639
How come we all
have to take it?

253
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,377
It keeps you nice and docile
while I kick your little ass.

254
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,479
I'm fine with that.

255
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:03,055
We interrupt this program
for a special report.

256
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,062
After tonight's murder...

257
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,927
in this neighborhood
of Springwood...

258
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:07,625
the Sheriff's Department
has confirmed...

259
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,657
that there is one victim...

260
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:10,963
Hey, turn that up, man.

261
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,062
Remain sketchy,
but the sheriff--

262
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,630
Sorry, Will.
You know the rules.

263
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:16,698
Turn that back on.

264
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,006
I know somebody
that lives in that house.

265
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,909
Come on, turn it back on, man!

266
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,243
I never ask for anything.

267
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,806
Just turn on
the fucking TV, please!

268
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,420
Fuck you, man!

269
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,615
What the fuck is your problem?

270
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:32,851
What are you doing, man?

271
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:35,223
You want 10ccs of that pink
tranquilizer in your ass?

272
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,852
That was Lori's house.

273
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,795
They said something
about a murder.

274
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,922
I gotta go to her.

275
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,592
I gotta see if she's OK.

276
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,692
Back to Springwood?

277
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,999
Do you want me to start
having nightmares again?

278
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,006
Don't start with that
dream demon shit again.

279
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,669
OK? You know that's all
just in your head.

280
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,077
Yeah, yeah, and who are you,
the poster boy for sanity?

281
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:56,102
You're the one
that told the cops...

282
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,740
Lori's dad killed his wife.

283
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:59,341
Yeah, right, and now it
looks like someone else...

284
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:00,510
got killed in the same house.

285
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:02,076
You think that's
a coincidence?

286
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,645
Two murders in one house?

287
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:08,091
Kurt, how many times
do I have to tell you, man?

288
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:09,821
I don't do checkers.

289
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:11,852
I'm an UNO guy, all right?

290
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:15,833
So go grab the fucking UNO deck
and we'll play, OK?

291
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:17,266
Please. Thank you.

292
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:22,934
Look at us, Will.

293
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:24,999
Look around you, man.

294
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:27,034
We're institutionalized.

295
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:31,741
We're stuck here.
We're not going anywhere.

296
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:42,819
I do miss my family, man.

297
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:48,857
I mean, it's been four years
since I've seen 'em, you know.

298
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,800
All these years,
and you're still convinced...

299
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,201
you saw her father do that?

300
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:54,034
I know what I saw, Mark.

301
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:57,200
Fuck what the doctors try
to get me to believe.

302
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:59,233
I need to know if she's OK.

303
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,188
You want to play?

304
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:34,537
Sweet dreams, monkey boy.

305
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,579
What the hell
was that for, man?

306
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:43,415
Heh heh heh!

307
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,290
You're a fucking lunatic,
you know that?

308
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:51,852
I know you are,
but what am l?

309
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,074
Are you sure
you didn't see anyone?

310
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,209
No, Dad, none of us did.

311
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:16,186
I already went over this
with the police.

312
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,453
It's just...

313
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,431
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

314
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,990
You're all I have left.

315
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:32,830
Dad, I'm not going anywhere.

316
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:36,507
I promise.

317
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,839
Look at you.

318
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,139
You're exhausted.

319
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,874
Lori.

320
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:45,041
We need to get you to bed!

321
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,912
I don't want to
go to sleep, Dad.

322
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,479
I just want to see my friends.

323
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:54,321
I don't think it's a good idea
for you to go to school today.

324
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,384
You've just been through
a very traumatic experience.

325
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,726
Dad, please...

326
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:01,288
I just need to get
out of the house, OK?

327
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,666
I'll be fine.
I promise.

328
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,844
Well, at least drink your juice.

329
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:20,683
Will Rollins
and the Davis boy...

330
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,619
escaped from Westin Hills
last night.

331
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:24,918
Oh, Jesus.

332
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:27,220
It's all coming apart again.

333
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,887
Don't worry.
We'll find them.

334
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,987
Keep this thing contained.

335
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:45,404
Lori!

336
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:48,776
Oh, my God! God, you guys,
I'm so glad you're here.

337
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:50,678
Blake's dead, too.

338
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,842
What?

339
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,182
Yeah, he--

340
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:00,847
He was stabbed
to death late last night.

341
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,019
Same with his dad.

342
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,790
What?

343
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:09,800
Shit, shit!
This is bullshit!

344
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:11,358
The police are blaming
everything on Blake...

345
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,428
Iike its some kind
of Columbine thing or something.

346
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:15,234
They're saying he went crazy.

347
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:18,299
Killed Trey, killed his dad,
and then took his own life?

348
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,573
This is so fucking messed up.

349
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:22,136
This is messed up.

350
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:24,981
Excuse me. Sorry.

351
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:26,506
Lori?

352
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:28,018
What is it, Linderman?

353
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:29,520
Um, well, I heard
what happened,

354
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:31,419
and I just wanted to
express how, um...

355
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:34,050
well, to tell you
how sorry I was.

356
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,356
Thank you.
That's sweet.

357
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:39,295
Right. Actually if you need
anybody to talk to or maybe--

358
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:41,492
Whoa, Linderman,
let me give you a tip.

359
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,467
Place your hormones
back in the box...

360
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:45,093
and quit while
you're ahead, OK?

361
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:46,967
We don't have time
for Date-a-Dork right now.

362
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,165
Thanks.

363
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:51,170
Right. Sorry.

364
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:53,109
I swear, every day
it's the same thing.

365
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:54,702
He's like one of those
fucking froufrou dogs...

366
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:56,179
that keeps humping your leg.

367
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,348
Give a couple to some ladies.

368
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:00,646
Thanks, man.

369
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:01,652
I see what
you're saying, Gibb...

370
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:02,710
but that's exactly
why you should go.

371
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,483
I mean, be amongst friends,
where it's safe.

372
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:05,819
There's gonna be a whole lot
of loving there for you...

373
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:08,018
and my boy Trey, all right?

374
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:09,754
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
I should go.

375
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,591
I could use a few dozen drinks.

376
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,597
That a girl.

377
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,428
Let your freak flag fly.

378
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,058
See you there.

379
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:17,090
You want to go?

380
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,035
No, I don't think so.

381
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,538
I--I didn't get much
sleep last night...

382
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,040
and when I did sleep...

383
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:24,701
I had the most
terrible nightmares.

384
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:26,904
Lori, you had to sleep
at a police station.

385
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,310
I'd have nightmares, too.

386
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:29,870
No, no, no,
it wasn't like that.

387
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:31,848
I mean, this was really real.

388
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,510
I mean, there was this man...

389
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,576
but he more like
a monster really...

390
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,985
and they kept
calling him Freddy...

391
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:38,819
-and he was so real.
-Shh!

392
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:40,222
What did he look like?

393
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:43,056
He--he had this...

394
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:44,925
dark brown hat, and...

395
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:47,363
his skin was
terribly burnt...

396
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,731
and on this right hand
he had this like these...

397
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,258
razor fingers, and--

398
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:52,599
You must be tripping.

399
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:53,797
No, no, no!

400
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,237
And then there were
these little girls...

401
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,070
It's OK.
It was a bad dream.

402
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:59,440
They were singing like
this--this song like--

403
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:04,608
One, two, Freddy's
coming for you.

404
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:06,742
You know why they sing that?

405
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:09,345
Because that's when
he comes for you...

406
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:11,355
in your dreams.

407
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,550
You're lucky to be alive.

408
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:14,819
Who is he?

409
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,417
He's a child murderer...

410
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,520
that some parents
from around here burned alive...

411
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,827
but then he came back.

412
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:24,198
Back for revenge
in our nightmares.

413
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:25,896
Funny no one ever
told us about him, huh?

414
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:27,165
-OK, thank you!
-No!

415
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,297
You want some free advice?

416
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:30,170
Coffee.
Make friends with it.

417
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,766
Mark!

418
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:32,970
That's enough.

419
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:36,036
You're scaring her.

420
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:42,246
Will?

421
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:44,448
Hey.

422
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,051
I thought you might
be in trouble, so we--

423
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:52,586
Lori! Oh, my God!

424
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,756
Lori, honey, wake up!

425
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:56,266
Someone get help, please!

426
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:57,893
Someone get some help, please!

427
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:01,929
The principal!
Will, let's go, let's go!

428
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:03,736
Please, somebody help her.
Lori?

429
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:14,583
How much longer
is it gonna take?

430
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:16,246
-ls she OK or what?
-Shh!

431
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:18,084
Tsk!

432
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:44,145
For nose jobs,
what kind of anesthesia...

433
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:45,809
do the doctors use?

434
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,511
They put you
all the way under, right?

435
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,630
Got your nose!

436
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,300
Strong work, man.

437
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:13,469
I came to make sure she's OK...

438
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:15,843
and you put her
in the infirmary.

439
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,974
What were you
thinking about...

440
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:22,782
telling her
all that stuff, man?

441
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,049
I mean, we're not in group.

442
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:25,248
Because I'm thinking
for the first time in my life...

443
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,190
that maybe I'm not crazy...

444
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:28,715
that my brother wasn't crazy.

445
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,728
She had the same dream, Will.

446
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:32,730
Will Rollins!
Mark Davis!

447
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:44,574
This doesn't make any sense.

448
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:46,008
There's nothing on Krueger.

449
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:49,070
Not his arrest, his death,
not even a birth certificate.

450
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:51,843
Whole sections of
the records are gone.

451
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:55,182
Look at all these
blacked-out obituaries.

452
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:04,890
January eighteenth.

453
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:08,228
That's the day my brother
committed suicide.

454
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:10,257
Why isn't that in here?

455
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:14,967
I don't know!

456
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:17,338
But I'm sure there's
a good reason.

457
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:20,300
Remember in group
when they told us...

458
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:21,710
not to jump to conclusions?

459
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:22,906
Listen to yourself.

460
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:24,778
You're holding onto
that psychobabble bullshit...

461
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:27,376
Iike it's some kind of
security blanket, man.

462
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:31,047
Let it go.
They've covered him up, Will.

463
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,522
They never told us
about Freddy...

464
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,457
because that's how they
decided to beat him.

465
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:37,393
They treated him like he
was a fucking disease...

466
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:38,452
and they locked up
all the kids...

467
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,463
who had made
contact with him...

468
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:41,226
so they wouldn't
infect the others.

469
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:42,460
That's crazy.

470
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,968
Is it?

471
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:47,267
How come we were
never allowed...

472
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,773
to call any of
our friends, man?

473
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:52,207
How come none of our
friends ever called us?

474
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:55,269
We were in a fucking
quarantine, man.

475
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:57,781
That's what
Westin Hills was for.

476
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:00,181
Well, even if all
you're saying is true...

477
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,618
then why didn't
Freddy kill Lori?

478
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:05,214
Maybe he's not
strong enough yet.

479
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,884
My brother said it's our fear
that gives him his power.

480
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,257
Yeah, well,
you sure as hell...

481
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,785
spread enough fear
today at school.

482
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:13,820
Holy shit.

483
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:19,431
You're right.

484
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:23,634
They wanted to forget Freddy so
they wouldn't fear him.

485
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:26,269
What if I screwed up
the town's plan?

486
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:30,343
Fuck! This fucker's gonna spread
like the plague, man!

487
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:33,612
Kids are gonna start
falling asleep, it's gonna--

488
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:35,084
Let's leave, man.
Let's leave right now.

489
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,086
No, I can't leave.

490
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,280
Why not?

491
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:39,256
I gotta go talk to Lori.
I gotta see if she's OK.

492
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,587
Well, is she worth dying for?

493
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,150
Because if you fall asleep,
you ain't waking up.

494
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:46,493
If that's the case,
how come you're not dead?

495
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:47,725
Or any of the freaks at Westin?

496
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:50,996
When's the last time
you even had a nightmare?

497
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:52,525
I don't know.

498
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,504
I can't remember
my dreams anymore.

499
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,066
Look, just give me
one night, OK?

500
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,045
Just let me find Lori,
and then we're out of here.

501
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:05,539
I swear.

502
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,876
All right.

503
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,716
If your ass isn't back here by
dawn, I'm gone.

504
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:12,780
We clear on that?

505
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:16,658
This baby's my brother's
pride and joy, so be careful.

506
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,384
Oh, shit.

507
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:51,417
Linderman!

508
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:54,522
Shack, I don't drink.

509
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:17,378
Hi, Lori. Didn't think
I'd see you here.

510
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:19,117
Can I get you
something to drink?

511
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:22,786
Smooth opening, but, you know,
we're already taken care of.

512
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:25,159
What happened
to your clothes?

513
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:27,289
Oh, this.

514
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:28,423
I was playing
a drinking game...

515
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:31,799
with some
of the lower primates...

516
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,326
and I guess I'm penalized
for my ability...

517
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:34,998
to read above
a fourth-grade level.

518
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,768
Linderman, you know,
I always pictured you...

519
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:39,299
as a straight up bedwetter.

520
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:41,311
You know what, Kia?

521
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:42,812
I used to think you hated me...

522
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:44,576
because you thought
I wasn't good enough for Lori...

523
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:45,877
but that's not it.

524
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,147
You tear me down
to make yourself feel better...

525
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:49,585
because you really
hate yourself...

526
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,315
which is kind of pathetic
when you actually...

527
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:52,515
stop and think about it,
assuming, of course...

528
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:54,388
you can think
with all that makeup...

529
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,450
weighing down your head.

530
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,424
The cops said Blake
committed suicide.

531
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,027
Apparently,
it was grief over Trey.

532
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,298
No, man, that's bullshit.

533
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:09,306
I heard some guy Krueger
killed them both.

534
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,308
Said his name to my parents,
they almost shit themselves.

535
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:12,309
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man,
and I heard...

536
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:13,810
that Freddy freak,
he used to live here.

537
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:16,279
Fucking gutted Trey like
a Goddamn turkey, man.

538
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:20,250
Like I heard his intestines and
shit was on the floor--

539
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:23,447
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

540
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:28,184
Oh, my God.

541
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:30,820
Look who's here.
Look who's here!

542
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:42,363
What are you looking at?

543
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:44,704
Come on, come on, let's dance.

544
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:47,176
Come on, Linderman, let's go.

545
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:49,202
Where have you been, Will?

546
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:50,976
Didn't you get my letters?

547
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:52,380
What letters?

548
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:55,385
They must've never
even mailed them.

549
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:58,388
Who?

550
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:02,688
The...doctors at Westin Hills.

551
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:07,158
I've been in
a psychiatric hospital.

552
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:08,665
Mark was with me there.

553
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:11,463
Some other kids, too.

554
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,493
I don't understand.

555
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,467
Well, I saw on the news
the other night...

556
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,601
I mean, that kid that was
killed at your house.

557
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:22,408
I mean, I needed to know
that you were safe.

558
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:24,038
What happened?

559
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:25,571
I don't know.
I don't know.

560
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:27,481
Nobody knows.
Nobody saw what happened...

561
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,985
and the police have been
acting really weird...

562
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,453
Iike they know something...

563
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:32,649
and I heard them
mention some name.

564
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,419
Some...

565
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,858
Freddy. Freddy Krueger.

566
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:38,759
Where was your dad?

567
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:40,229
Out of town.

568
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:41,561
Are you sure?

569
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,191
What is going on, Will?

570
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:44,895
Well, look, four years ago,
I thought l--

571
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,096
Enough with
this bullshit talk.

572
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:48,105
Let's go shake our ass
on the dance floor.

573
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:49,436
Come on!

574
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,859
I'm dead one day...

575
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,919
and you're already out
getting shit-faced?

576
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,089
Same old Gibb!

577
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:17,760
Trey, l--
I can't believe it.

578
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,531
Come on, let's go.

579
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:25,133
Babe, don't make me
ask you twice, OK?

580
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:28,641
Now!

581
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,557
Trey?

582
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,205
No!

583
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:33,073
Open the door!

584
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,941
Please, the door--

585
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,081
No! No!

586
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,843
You're the one
that killed Trey!

587
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:50,547
Oh, don't worry about
my little errand boy.

588
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:55,287
The only to fear
is fear himself!

589
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:24,878
No!

590
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,074
She's mine.

591
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:31,451
Mine! Mine!

592
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:41,990
This everclear
is kicking my ass.

593
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:43,056
This--

594
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,039
Check out this fucking guy.

595
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:00,311
Well, hey, Jethro!

596
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,377
This is a rave,
not a Halloween party.

597
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,322
Why don't you go
find yourself a pig to fuck?

598
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,916
Yeah!

599
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:12,360
Invite only, cornpoke,
and you weren't invite--

600
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:14,455
Son of a bitch.

601
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:25,700
Yeah!

602
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:28,576
Burn, motherfucker!

603
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:49,459
No!

604
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:18,650
Run, man, run!

605
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:33,234
Freak!
You killed my brother!

606
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:49,089
Gibb! Oh, my God!

607
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,991
Oh, Gibb! No!

608
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:52,495
Let's go!
Let's go, come on!

609
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,263
Was that him?

610
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,535
The guy you were talking about--
Freddy Krueger.

611
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:05,303
No, that wasn't
the guy in my dream.

612
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:06,366
That was somebody else!

613
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:09,311
Who cares about some
fucking dream guy, OK?

614
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:11,211
That psycho
in the hockey mask was real.

615
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:13,546
Dude, that goalie was
pissed about something.

616
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:14,744
We need to find the police.

617
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:17,083
No, no! Fuck the police!

618
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:18,645
Just take me home, Will.

619
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:30,890
Gibb, l--

620
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:32,401
I can't believe she...

621
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:33,596
I know.

622
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:41,168
Look, call me later, OK?
Please.

623
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:42,735
Just to check in.

624
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:50,553
Bye, Will.

625
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:53,021
Be careful.

626
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:13,376
Will, I'm gonna go inside now.

627
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:16,345
I think that's the last thing
you should do right now.

628
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,143
Oh, Will, please.

629
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:19,274
After everything
that's happened...

630
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:20,283
I just want to go to--

631
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:23,047
There's more
to it than that.

632
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:26,614
Look, I tried to tell
you this earlier.

633
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:28,249
The reason
I was sent to Westin...

634
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:32,729
is because I saw
your dad kill your mom.

635
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,422
Will, my mom died
in a car accident.

636
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:38,867
No, that's what he
wanted you to believe...

637
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,096
but I was there, Lori.

638
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:43,402
I was sneaking up to your room,
like I used to do.

639
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,271
Only you weren't there.

640
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:50,311
I saw him kill her.

641
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:53,083
Dad!

642
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:54,550
Get out of the van.

643
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,212
Get out of the van!
Where were you?

644
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,220
What are you doing?

645
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,653
I've been looking
all over for you!

646
00:45:58,689 --> 00:45:59,849
Get away from her!

647
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,221
You're in a helluva
lot of trouble, you know that?

648
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,816
Like I give
a shit anymore.

649
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,054
Get in the house!

650
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,356
You! I'm taking you
back to Westin.

651
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:07,386
No! No way!
You can't trust him, Lori.

652
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,228
Whatever you do,
don't go home with him!

653
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,893
No, listen to me!

654
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,868
He was the one
who had me committed!

655
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:14,427
You didn't understand.

656
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:15,961
You still don't.
You were confused!

657
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:16,973
Stop it!

658
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:18,599
Both of you, stop it!

659
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:20,234
Damn it, Will!
I am not gonna let you...

660
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,142
endanger my daughter again!

661
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:24,409
Not after everything
that's happened!

662
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,746
Stop it! Stop it! Fuck!

663
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,184
Lori!

664
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:37,453
I--l--

665
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:39,428
Did Mom die
in a car accident?

666
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,624
Yes. Of course she did.

667
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:43,132
Prove it.

668
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:44,794
Show me a death certificate.

669
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:47,167
Show me an autopsy report.

670
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:49,798
Lori, I don't think now
is the right time--

671
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,807
Really, Dad?

672
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:52,604
Because I think
it's a perfect time!

673
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,304
Why didn't you tell me
about Westin Hills?

674
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:55,811
Do you work there?

675
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:58,007
Because I thought you were
a fucking general practitioner!

676
00:46:58,048 --> 00:47:00,016
Yes, l...

677
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:02,541
I do some consulting
there now, but...

678
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:04,315
it's--it isn't
what you think.

679
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:07,915
Oh, my God.

680
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:10,859
So you knew about Will
this whole time.

681
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:14,455
Lori, listen to me.

682
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:18,696
You're upset.
We both are.

683
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:20,703
Now I think what you need now...

684
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:24,002
more than anything
is to get some rest.

685
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:25,702
Why don't I give you
some pills...

686
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:27,403
and that'll help you sleep...

687
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:29,935
and then we talk
about it in the morning?

688
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,811
I don't want
to sleep, Dad!

689
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,942
I want to know why
you've been lying to me!

690
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:35,042
We'll talk about it
in the morning!

691
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:36,814
Now do what I say!

692
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,287
Lori! Lori!

693
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:45,090
Open this door.
Open this door!

694
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:46,527
Go away!

695
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:47,530
Damn it, Lori!

696
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:49,191
Let me in!

697
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,365
Goddamn it!

698
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,254
It's OK, it's me.
It's me, shh! Shh!

699
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:23,425
You OK? Are you OK?

700
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:25,594
It's me, all right?

701
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:30,471
I don't know how your father's
connected to all this...

702
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:31,769
but I think
Mark was right.

703
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:34,641
There's some kind of cover-up
going on here with Krueger.

704
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:38,945
We can't trust the police.

705
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:42,312
We can't trust
any of the adults.

706
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:46,121
So what do we do?

707
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:47,919
We gotta get to Mark.

708
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:49,852
He's the expert in all of this.

709
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:50,882
He'll know what's going on.

710
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:06,070
You always looked out
for me, bro.

711
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,508
Hey, Mark.

712
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:46,313
I gotta stay awake.

713
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,062
Shit!

714
00:50:16,985 --> 00:50:19,010
Hey, Mark.

715
00:50:19,054 --> 00:50:20,612
You didn't forget
about me, did you?

716
00:50:20,655 --> 00:50:22,020
Oh, God.

717
00:50:22,057 --> 00:50:24,082
Oh, that's right!

718
00:50:24,126 --> 00:50:25,457
Everyone forgot!

719
00:50:25,494 --> 00:50:27,928
That's why they weren't
afraid anymore!

720
00:50:27,963 --> 00:50:29,453
That's why I needed Jason
to kill for me...

721
00:50:29,498 --> 00:50:31,591
to get them to remember.

722
00:50:31,633 --> 00:50:36,900
But now he just won't stop,
that hockey puck!

723
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:48,071
This isn't...real.

724
00:50:50,452 --> 00:50:54,081
Somebody, please, wake me up!

725
00:50:54,122 --> 00:50:55,419
Please!

726
00:51:06,268 --> 00:51:09,066
Mark! Mark, wake up!

727
00:51:09,104 --> 00:51:11,937
I need you to send
a little message for me.

728
00:51:11,973 --> 00:51:15,306
That's all,
just a little message.

729
00:51:15,343 --> 00:51:17,243
I'm not gonna do it.

730
00:51:17,279 --> 00:51:18,906
I won't do it!

731
00:51:18,947 --> 00:51:21,472
No?!

732
00:51:21,516 --> 00:51:24,417
I won't do it.

733
00:51:32,828 --> 00:51:38,664
I'll have to pass that message
myself, won't l?

734
00:51:43,872 --> 00:51:45,635
Oh, my God!

735
00:51:49,177 --> 00:51:53,113
Let go of me!

736
00:51:53,148 --> 00:51:54,706
Help...me.

737
00:51:54,749 --> 00:51:56,376
Mark!

738
00:52:06,895 --> 00:52:11,161
Pass on a little
message for me, will ya?

739
00:52:22,644 --> 00:52:25,613
Sheriff,
I've been compiling info...

740
00:52:25,647 --> 00:52:27,581
based on eyewitness reports
of the hockey mask killer.

741
00:52:27,616 --> 00:52:29,345
We already know who did this.

742
00:52:29,384 --> 00:52:31,375
Sheriff, we closed
down the school...

743
00:52:31,419 --> 00:52:33,182
and set up a curfew
for anyone under eighteen.

744
00:52:33,221 --> 00:52:34,313
Good.

745
00:52:34,356 --> 00:52:36,119
Now I want twenty-four-hour
roadblocks set up.

746
00:52:36,157 --> 00:52:37,749
Nobody leaves town,
nobody gets in.

747
00:52:37,792 --> 00:52:39,316
We're gonna contain
this son of a bitch...

748
00:52:39,361 --> 00:52:40,555
before he spreads any further.

749
00:52:40,595 --> 00:52:42,790
Yes, sir.

750
00:52:42,831 --> 00:52:44,731
Sir, shouldn't we have
the F.B.I. come in and--

751
00:52:44,766 --> 00:52:46,927
No outsiders, Stubbs.

752
00:52:46,968 --> 00:52:49,436
We can handle this.
We've stopped him before.

753
00:52:49,471 --> 00:52:51,701
OK, I'm a little lost here.

754
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,139
Stopped who before?

755
00:52:53,174 --> 00:52:56,371
We don't say his name out loud.

756
00:52:56,411 --> 00:52:58,345
You're not from around here.

757
00:52:58,380 --> 00:52:59,347
I don't expect you
to understand.

758
00:52:59,381 --> 00:53:01,440
With all due resect, Sheriff...

759
00:53:01,483 --> 00:53:04,077
I think we have a copycat
of the old Jason Voorhees...

760
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:05,484
Crystal Lake killer
on our hands--

761
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,817
You listen to me.

762
00:53:06,855 --> 00:53:09,289
We do things around here
a certain way for a reason...

763
00:53:09,324 --> 00:53:11,690
and that's given us
four years of peace.

764
00:53:11,726 --> 00:53:13,785
So you either do your job
and keep your mouth shut...

765
00:53:13,828 --> 00:53:16,023
or, so help me God,
I will lock you up!

766
00:53:16,064 --> 00:53:18,396
Do you understand me?!

767
00:53:21,436 --> 00:53:22,596
Yes, sir.

768
00:53:33,315 --> 00:53:35,180
Why don't we all just leave?

769
00:53:35,216 --> 00:53:39,949
No, even if we leave,
Freddy can still get us.

770
00:53:39,988 --> 00:53:43,424
We all know about him.
We're all afraid of him.

771
00:53:45,193 --> 00:53:49,892
It was our fear that
gave him his power.

772
00:53:49,931 --> 00:53:52,525
We're marked now.

773
00:53:52,567 --> 00:53:54,364
Man, screw that clown.

774
00:53:54,402 --> 00:53:55,869
I mean, what kind
of a pussy...

775
00:53:55,904 --> 00:53:57,565
comes after you
in your dreams anyway?

776
00:53:57,606 --> 00:54:00,632
Now, that big-ass mother fucker
back at the cornfield...

777
00:54:00,675 --> 00:54:02,836
all right, that's who
we should be afraid of.

778
00:54:02,877 --> 00:54:05,072
Tell me who
the fuck that was.

779
00:54:05,113 --> 00:54:07,513
His name was Jason Voorhees.

780
00:54:07,549 --> 00:54:10,780
Shit, man...um...

781
00:54:10,819 --> 00:54:13,754
How'd you know
we were here?

782
00:54:13,788 --> 00:54:16,018
Nothing personal,
but the Scooby van out back...

783
00:54:16,057 --> 00:54:17,854
wasn't exactly subtle.

784
00:54:17,892 --> 00:54:20,224
And never keep
your keys in the door.

785
00:54:20,261 --> 00:54:22,525
Great, so now we're
completely fucked.

786
00:54:22,564 --> 00:54:24,429
No, you're not.

787
00:54:24,466 --> 00:54:26,991
I'm here to help you.

788
00:54:27,035 --> 00:54:29,833
Now, this Jason Voorhees
supposedly drowned...

789
00:54:29,871 --> 00:54:32,362
at Camp Crystal Lake
back in 1957...

790
00:54:32,407 --> 00:54:34,136
when he was
eleven years old.

791
00:54:34,175 --> 00:54:36,973
The counselors weren't
watching him...

792
00:54:37,012 --> 00:54:39,810
then they made the mistake
of killing his mother.

793
00:54:39,848 --> 00:54:41,975
The legend has it...

794
00:54:42,017 --> 00:54:44,508
that Jason kept returning
from his grave...

795
00:54:44,552 --> 00:54:46,383
to punish whoever
returned to the camp.

796
00:54:46,421 --> 00:54:49,322
I think we're dealing
with a copycat here.

797
00:54:49,357 --> 00:54:50,949
No. No. No, no, no.

798
00:54:50,992 --> 00:54:52,482
He's not a copycat.

799
00:54:52,527 --> 00:54:54,154
I've seen what he can do.
He's the real Jason.

800
00:54:54,195 --> 00:54:56,493
That's impossible, Linderman.
Jason is dead.

801
00:54:56,531 --> 00:54:59,659
You'd better start thinking
outside your little box, dude...

802
00:54:59,701 --> 00:55:01,362
'cause somebody's
definitely breaking...

803
00:55:01,403 --> 00:55:03,428
the fucking reality rules, OK?

804
00:55:03,471 --> 00:55:04,836
It makes sense in a way.

805
00:55:04,873 --> 00:55:08,400
I mean, what if Freddy
brought Jason back...

806
00:55:08,443 --> 00:55:10,707
because he was too weak
to go after us on his own...

807
00:55:10,745 --> 00:55:13,305
so he used Jason.

808
00:55:13,348 --> 00:55:15,407
I mean, he knew that
we'd think it was him...

809
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:16,974
that we'd spread
the fear again.

810
00:55:17,018 --> 00:55:18,212
And now that it's working...

811
00:55:18,253 --> 00:55:20,813
it's like he can't
shut Jason back down.

812
00:55:20,855 --> 00:55:22,482
Wait a minute.

813
00:55:22,524 --> 00:55:25,550
Freddy died by fire,
Jason by water.

814
00:55:25,593 --> 00:55:27,652
How can we use that?

815
00:55:27,696 --> 00:55:30,494
I think we should
concentrate on Jason first.

816
00:55:30,532 --> 00:55:32,227
But I thought we decided...

817
00:55:32,267 --> 00:55:33,962
that Freddy was the one
pulling the strings.

818
00:55:34,002 --> 00:55:36,436
Shouldn't we go
after him first?

819
00:55:36,471 --> 00:55:39,099
I don't know, maybe
what we need to do is...

820
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:41,734
to offer Freddy
a sacrifice.

821
00:55:41,776 --> 00:55:43,334
Yeah, yeah, totally.

822
00:55:43,378 --> 00:55:46,609
Like a virgin, right?
Someone pure.

823
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:54,420
Dude, don't look at me.

824
00:55:54,456 --> 00:55:56,924
Even if you pay for it,
it still counts.

825
00:55:56,958 --> 00:55:59,017
Oh, come on.

826
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,858
Look, we all know who
the real virgin is here.

827
00:56:01,896 --> 00:56:04,558
-Kia!
-Oh, come on, Lori.

828
00:56:04,599 --> 00:56:06,396
I know you never
made it with Will.

829
00:56:06,434 --> 00:56:11,235
Why would he want to when
he can fuck somebody like me?

830
00:56:16,678 --> 00:56:18,270
Let's tie the bitch up.

831
00:56:21,249 --> 00:56:23,240
What?

832
00:56:25,687 --> 00:56:28,053
Don't worry, angel.

833
00:56:28,089 --> 00:56:29,750
You've still got me.

834
00:56:29,791 --> 00:56:32,259
Come on, give daddy a kiss.

835
00:56:36,965 --> 00:56:40,628
Your eyes say no-no...

836
00:56:40,668 --> 00:56:45,105
but my mouth says yes-yes.

837
00:56:49,544 --> 00:56:51,171
Lori, are you all right?

838
00:56:51,212 --> 00:56:52,372
You fell asleep.

839
00:57:00,488 --> 00:57:02,581
Oh, shit!

840
00:57:06,427 --> 00:57:08,418
I pulled that out of my dream.

841
00:57:08,463 --> 00:57:10,454
How is that possible?

842
00:57:10,498 --> 00:57:12,523
Anything is possible now!

843
00:57:12,567 --> 00:57:13,829
God, you just don't get it!

844
00:57:13,868 --> 00:57:15,995
Oh, God, y'all, two killers?

845
00:57:16,037 --> 00:57:17,937
We're not safe awake or asleep.

846
00:57:17,972 --> 00:57:19,803
It's not the sleep
that's killing us...

847
00:57:19,841 --> 00:57:20,808
it's our dreams.

848
00:57:20,842 --> 00:57:23,504
At Westin, Mark and l
never had dreams.

849
00:57:23,545 --> 00:57:26,275
Were you on any drugs?

850
00:57:26,314 --> 00:57:28,714
Yeah, but there's
something called hypnocil.

851
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:30,809
They never told us
what it was for...

852
00:57:30,852 --> 00:57:32,877
but everyone there
was taking it.

853
00:57:34,989 --> 00:57:37,617
Experimental drug...

854
00:57:37,659 --> 00:57:39,217
not even approved yet
by the F.D.A.

855
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:41,057
Oh, shit.

856
00:57:41,095 --> 00:57:44,997
Used for...
suppression of dreams.

857
00:57:45,033 --> 00:57:48,525
We need those pills,
enough for all of us.

858
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:50,697
Can you get us
back to Westin Hills?

859
00:58:11,025 --> 00:58:12,617
All right,
this isn't it, guys.

860
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,491
Come on, let's go.

861
00:58:14,529 --> 00:58:15,496
Hey, dude.

862
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:16,861
Let's take a little
J-break, huh?

863
00:58:16,898 --> 00:58:19,560
No, man. He's a cop.

864
00:58:19,601 --> 00:58:22,092
Come on. What's he
gonna do, arrest me?

865
00:58:22,136 --> 00:58:24,468
Hold up.
Hang on a second.

866
00:58:24,505 --> 00:58:25,870
Fuck.

867
00:58:34,883 --> 00:58:36,680
That's better.

868
00:58:51,933 --> 00:58:54,094
Where's Freeburg?

869
00:58:54,135 --> 00:58:55,124
Come on. Come on!

870
00:59:12,921 --> 00:59:14,081
This is "D" wing.

871
00:59:14,122 --> 00:59:16,818
These are the ones
who wouldn't stop dreaming.

872
00:59:24,866 --> 00:59:26,094
Are they dead?

873
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:32,439
They're in a coma.

874
00:59:32,473 --> 00:59:35,271
It says they were given
too much hypnocil.

875
00:59:36,644 --> 00:59:38,509
Who would do this to people?

876
00:59:38,546 --> 00:59:41,174
Your dad's name
is at the bottom...

877
00:59:41,215 --> 00:59:42,773
of both of these charts.

878
00:59:50,892 --> 00:59:53,258
Cool...yeah.

879
01:00:03,237 --> 01:00:05,865
What the fuck?

880
01:00:19,654 --> 01:00:21,053
Nice.

881
01:00:28,763 --> 01:00:30,560
Oh, yeah.

882
01:00:35,003 --> 01:00:36,698
Hold up, man.

883
01:00:48,716 --> 01:00:49,740
What?

884
01:00:55,723 --> 01:00:56,917
What do you want?

885
01:01:00,094 --> 01:01:03,723
No, I don't know where
the hypnocil is, OK?

886
01:01:14,776 --> 01:01:16,141
I can't pour these
down the drain.

887
01:01:16,177 --> 01:01:17,610
We need this stuff.

888
01:01:34,429 --> 01:01:35,794
Freeburg!

889
01:01:37,799 --> 01:01:38,766
Freeburg!

890
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,062
What are you doing?

891
01:01:40,101 --> 01:01:41,227
We need those drugs!

892
01:01:42,236 --> 01:01:43,498
Dude, no! Dude--

893
01:01:50,478 --> 01:01:52,105
Go on! Get out of here!

894
01:01:52,146 --> 01:01:53,807
Go!

895
01:02:09,497 --> 01:02:10,930
What was that?

896
01:02:14,235 --> 01:02:15,759
Let's go check it out.
Let's go.

897
01:02:17,038 --> 01:02:21,236
Get back! Shit! Hell!

898
01:02:21,275 --> 01:02:22,799
Fucker!

899
01:02:22,844 --> 01:02:24,243
Help me!

900
01:02:41,329 --> 01:02:42,626
Shit! They're all empty!

901
01:02:42,663 --> 01:02:43,630
We gotta keep looking.

902
01:02:43,664 --> 01:02:45,029
Maybe there's some down here.

903
01:02:45,066 --> 01:02:47,057
Damn, it's gotta
be here somewhere.

904
01:02:57,678 --> 01:02:58,770
Freeburg, come on!

905
01:02:58,813 --> 01:03:00,713
Come on! Come on!

906
01:03:00,748 --> 01:03:02,978
What are you waiting for?
Come on!

907
01:03:03,017 --> 01:03:05,144
Freeburg, time to go.

908
01:03:05,186 --> 01:03:07,484
We gotta go!
Now! come on!

909
01:03:07,522 --> 01:03:10,184
Let me handle this, bitch.

910
01:03:10,224 --> 01:03:11,885
What?

911
01:03:13,427 --> 01:03:15,224
Come on, come on!
OK, let's go!

912
01:03:16,597 --> 01:03:17,962
Let's go.

913
01:03:17,999 --> 01:03:19,091
No, wait, wait!

914
01:03:19,133 --> 01:03:20,122
Look.

915
01:03:23,771 --> 01:03:25,363
Come to Freddy.

916
01:03:26,541 --> 01:03:29,374
These are my children, Jason.

917
01:03:29,777 --> 01:03:32,268
Go back where you belong!

918
01:03:42,957 --> 01:03:45,152
Fuck you!

919
01:03:46,928 --> 01:03:48,862
Linderman...

920
01:03:50,731 --> 01:03:54,098
These are my children, Jason.

921
01:03:54,135 --> 01:03:56,603
Go back where you belong.

922
01:04:08,916 --> 01:04:12,750
Jason...Jason.

923
01:04:12,787 --> 01:04:16,120
My special, special boy.

924
01:04:20,494 --> 01:04:22,860
I'm disappointed
in you, Jason.

925
01:04:22,897 --> 01:04:24,797
You disobeyed me.

926
01:04:24,832 --> 01:04:26,527
You were supposed
to come back home...

927
01:04:26,567 --> 01:04:28,330
just kill a few of them!

928
01:04:28,369 --> 01:04:30,564
But I blame myself.
I should've known...

929
01:04:30,605 --> 01:04:32,732
you wouldn't be able
to stop killing!

930
01:04:32,773 --> 01:04:37,938
You are like a big, stupid dog
who can't stop eating...

931
01:04:37,979 --> 01:04:42,416
even though your master
said you've had enough!

932
01:04:48,522 --> 01:04:52,959
Now it's time to put
this bad dog to sleep...

933
01:04:55,363 --> 01:04:56,489
for good!

934
01:05:03,671 --> 01:05:05,263
Not my arm!

935
01:05:31,399 --> 01:05:33,867
Welcome to my nightmare.

936
01:05:53,954 --> 01:05:56,184
Penny for your thoughts, chief!

937
01:05:58,025 --> 01:06:00,186
Oh, scary.

938
01:06:20,047 --> 01:06:21,309
Tilt.

939
01:06:45,005 --> 01:06:47,200
Why won't you die?

940
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,959
Come on. Come on!

941
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:36,549
So you are afraid of something
after all, huh?

942
01:07:46,834 --> 01:07:49,462
How in the fuck did I let y'all
talk me into this?

943
01:07:49,503 --> 01:07:51,596
Why don't we just
try and do it here?

944
01:07:51,639 --> 01:07:53,630
Why go all the way
to Crystal Lake?

945
01:07:53,674 --> 01:07:55,733
Best-case scenario: Jason wins.

946
01:07:55,776 --> 01:07:58,540
He'll already be home,
back where he belongs.

947
01:07:58,579 --> 01:07:59,773
I mean, why follow us anymore?

948
01:07:59,814 --> 01:08:01,475
And if Freddy wins?

949
01:08:01,515 --> 01:08:04,507
At least Jason
has home-field advantage.

950
01:08:29,643 --> 01:08:33,010
Aww...how sweet.

951
01:08:34,148 --> 01:08:36,309
You ugly little shit.

952
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:41,185
Now there's a face...
only a mother could love!

953
01:08:43,524 --> 01:08:44,718
Yeah!

954
01:08:44,758 --> 01:08:46,658
Now we're getting somewhere.

955
01:08:46,694 --> 01:08:49,322
Let's see
what really scares you.

956
01:08:56,403 --> 01:08:59,236
And dig a little deeper.

957
01:09:28,936 --> 01:09:33,373
I'm dying to see what skeletons
are hidden in your closet.

958
01:09:50,224 --> 01:09:52,522
We're seriously running
out of tranq here, guys.

959
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:55,791
I got maybe one dose,
plus enough for Lori.

960
01:09:55,829 --> 01:09:57,057
Well, we're almost there.

961
01:09:57,097 --> 01:09:58,496
Then I better get going.

962
01:09:58,532 --> 01:09:59,760
No, no, just...

963
01:10:04,805 --> 01:10:06,136
I don't want you to go.

964
01:10:06,173 --> 01:10:07,697
I'm coming back.

965
01:10:07,741 --> 01:10:10,403
Just give me fifteen minutes,
then wake me up.

966
01:10:10,444 --> 01:10:12,674
I'll bring that bastard
Freddy back through.

967
01:10:12,713 --> 01:10:15,443
Just make sure
Jason's waiting for him.

968
01:10:20,087 --> 01:10:23,215
Now I lay me down to sleep.

969
01:10:44,778 --> 01:10:49,078
Freak show! Freak show!
Freak show! Freak show!

970
01:10:49,116 --> 01:10:50,606
Bull's-eye!

971
01:10:54,722 --> 01:10:56,747
Freak show!
Freak show! Freak show!

972
01:10:56,790 --> 01:10:58,189
Try this on!

973
01:10:59,393 --> 01:11:02,487
Freak show!
Freak show! Freak show!

974
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:07,833
Stupid!

975
01:11:11,138 --> 01:11:13,106
Aren't you gonna help the kid?!

976
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:15,665
Can't you see I'm busy here?

977
01:11:15,709 --> 01:11:17,142
You mean you're not coming?

978
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:23,345
It's not my fault this bitch
is dead on her feet.

979
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:33,751
It's been five minutes.

980
01:11:33,794 --> 01:11:35,989
Well, that was the last
of the tranq, OK? We're out.

981
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:37,964
Calm down, OK?
Just relax!

982
01:11:51,745 --> 01:11:53,679
Heeeeelp!

983
01:11:53,714 --> 01:11:57,343
Wait! Give me your hand!

984
01:11:57,384 --> 01:12:00,148
Give me your hand!

985
01:12:01,655 --> 01:12:02,747
Help!

986
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:05,054
Jason?

987
01:12:05,092 --> 01:12:06,855
Jason Vorhees?

988
01:12:17,538 --> 01:12:19,506
Y'all...y'all...

989
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:20,564
Y'all, something's wrong.

990
01:12:20,607 --> 01:12:21,801
It's like he's drowning
or something.

991
01:12:21,842 --> 01:12:23,207
Freddy must be killing him.

992
01:12:23,243 --> 01:12:24,210
We need him alive!

993
01:12:24,244 --> 01:12:25,336
Dude, what do you
want me to do...

994
01:12:25,379 --> 01:12:27,847
Iike, give him
mouth-to-mouth or something?

995
01:12:35,589 --> 01:12:37,420
Hell no.
Why are you--

996
01:12:37,458 --> 01:12:39,926
No! No, I'm not
gonna do that. No!

997
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:41,222
Kia, look, I would
do it myself...

998
01:12:41,261 --> 01:12:42,956
but I've had asthma
since I was six, OK?

999
01:12:42,996 --> 01:12:44,463
I don't have the lung power.

1000
01:12:44,498 --> 01:12:45,931
No.

1001
01:12:45,966 --> 01:12:48,298
Kia, he has asthma!

1002
01:12:48,335 --> 01:12:50,860
Ooh! Ooh...

1003
01:12:52,106 --> 01:12:53,801
Look, you can do this, OK?

1004
01:12:53,841 --> 01:12:54,967
You can do this.
You just--

1005
01:12:55,008 --> 01:12:58,739
Shut up! You're not the one
that has to do this.

1006
01:12:58,779 --> 01:12:59,768
I know, but l--

1007
01:12:59,813 --> 01:13:01,178
Shut up!

1008
01:13:04,251 --> 01:13:06,310
Oh, my God.

1009
01:13:08,255 --> 01:13:10,723
Ohh, God!

1010
01:13:15,963 --> 01:13:17,624
Oh, man.

1011
01:13:17,664 --> 01:13:20,656
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1012
01:13:44,324 --> 01:13:46,451
You!

1013
01:14:00,641 --> 01:14:02,370
What's wrong, Lori?

1014
01:14:02,409 --> 01:14:04,309
Miss your wake-up call?

1015
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:09,041
Wake me up!
I got him! I got him!

1016
01:14:14,154 --> 01:14:16,281
No!

1017
01:14:16,323 --> 01:14:17,347
Lori, come on! Wake up!

1018
01:14:17,391 --> 01:14:19,052
Lori, wake up, please!

1019
01:14:19,092 --> 01:14:20,491
Look!

1020
01:14:20,527 --> 01:14:22,017
Guys, look.

1021
01:14:23,730 --> 01:14:24,822
We're almost there.

1022
01:14:24,865 --> 01:14:27,663
Help me. Come on.
We gotta get her up.

1023
01:14:28,936 --> 01:14:30,995
Come on. Start running.
Start running.

1024
01:14:31,038 --> 01:14:32,938
Wake me up!

1025
01:14:34,675 --> 01:14:36,336
Daddy, don't!

1026
01:15:02,703 --> 01:15:05,228
Daddy!
No, daddy, don't!

1027
01:15:05,272 --> 01:15:07,103
Freddy!
It was you!

1028
01:15:08,141 --> 01:15:09,233
I've always had a thing...

1029
01:15:09,276 --> 01:15:12,074
for the whores
that live in this house.

1030
01:15:22,256 --> 01:15:23,280
Lori, wake up!

1031
01:15:26,226 --> 01:15:27,557
Oh, shit.

1032
01:15:32,499 --> 01:15:33,932
It's him. He's here.

1033
01:15:33,967 --> 01:15:35,559
Lori, come on!
You gotta wake up!

1034
01:15:40,307 --> 01:15:41,934
Oh, yes.

1035
01:15:47,014 --> 01:15:48,982
My God!

1036
01:15:51,184 --> 01:15:52,776
Come on, Lori, wake up!

1037
01:15:52,819 --> 01:15:54,411
Lori, please. Wake up!

1038
01:15:54,454 --> 01:15:56,046
Lori, please.
Lori, please.

1039
01:16:02,496 --> 01:16:03,520
Go! Go, go, go!

1040
01:16:06,566 --> 01:16:07,863
Lori!

1041
01:16:13,106 --> 01:16:15,131
Oh, you fuckin' asshole!

1042
01:16:15,175 --> 01:16:16,301
Goddamn it!

1043
01:16:20,347 --> 01:16:23,373
Welcome to my world, bitch.

1044
01:16:25,619 --> 01:16:28,349
I should warn you, princess...

1045
01:16:28,388 --> 01:16:30,982
the first time tends
to get a little...

1046
01:16:32,225 --> 01:16:34,352
messy.

1047
01:16:51,378 --> 01:16:52,367
Get away from her!

1048
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:00,852
Linderman.

1049
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:09,223
Oh! Oh, no!

1050
01:17:16,937 --> 01:17:19,599
Die, you little bitch.

1051
01:18:13,994 --> 01:18:16,394
Jesus, Linderman.
You--you're really hurt.

1052
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:18,261
No. No, no, no.
Don't worry about me.

1053
01:18:18,298 --> 01:18:19,424
Just a scratch.

1054
01:18:19,466 --> 01:18:20,592
Just go get help, OK?

1055
01:18:20,634 --> 01:18:22,659
What? You don't think--

1056
01:18:22,702 --> 01:18:24,499
Look, I'm just gonna
rest here a minute.

1057
01:18:24,538 --> 01:18:26,836
-Linderman--
-I'm fine, Kia.

1058
01:18:26,873 --> 01:18:28,135
Really.
Now get out of here.

1059
01:18:28,175 --> 01:18:29,699
-Go get help.
-But you--

1060
01:18:29,743 --> 01:18:31,267
Just go.

1061
01:18:32,345 --> 01:18:35,837
OK, but I'm gonna be back
as soon as I can.

1062
01:19:15,822 --> 01:19:17,084
Lori!

1063
01:19:17,124 --> 01:19:19,456
Think you're so smart,
huh, bitch?

1064
01:19:20,927 --> 01:19:22,292
Freddy!

1065
01:19:31,838 --> 01:19:33,931
How sweet...

1066
01:19:33,974 --> 01:19:35,874
dark meat.

1067
01:19:35,909 --> 01:19:38,776
-No! Kia!
-Let's go!

1068
01:19:38,812 --> 01:19:40,279
Nooo!

1069
01:19:40,313 --> 01:19:42,645
So you're the one
everyone's afraid of?

1070
01:19:44,918 --> 01:19:46,943
Tell me something.

1071
01:19:46,987 --> 01:19:48,682
What kind of faggot...

1072
01:19:48,722 --> 01:19:51,350
runs around
in a Christmas sweater?

1073
01:19:52,726 --> 01:19:55,058
I mean, come on. Get real.

1074
01:19:55,095 --> 01:19:56,756
You're not even scary.

1075
01:19:56,796 --> 01:19:58,559
You're not even scary.

1076
01:19:58,598 --> 01:20:02,432
And let's talk about
the butter knives.

1077
01:20:02,469 --> 01:20:04,266
What is with the butter knives?

1078
01:20:04,304 --> 01:20:07,398
You trying to compensate
for something?

1079
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:08,907
Maybe coming up
a little short there...

1080
01:20:08,942 --> 01:20:12,002
between the legs,
Mr. Krueger?

1081
01:20:12,045 --> 01:20:13,205
Hmm.

1082
01:20:13,246 --> 01:20:16,773
I mean, you got these
teensy-weensy little things...

1083
01:20:16,816 --> 01:20:22,254
and Jason has got this
big ol' thing that's like...

1084
01:20:31,298 --> 01:20:32,287
Kia!

1085
01:20:32,332 --> 01:20:34,232
-No! No!
-Come on!

1086
01:20:39,606 --> 01:20:40,595
Come on, Lori.
Let's go.

1087
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:41,664
We can't help her anymore.

1088
01:20:41,708 --> 01:20:43,335
No! I'm staying!

1089
01:20:43,376 --> 01:20:45,936
Are you crazy?
You got what you wanted.

1090
01:20:45,979 --> 01:20:47,810
You pulled Freddy out,
and now he's fighting Jason.

1091
01:20:47,847 --> 01:20:49,041
Come on!
What more do you want?

1092
01:20:49,082 --> 01:20:50,947
He killed my mother, Will!

1093
01:20:50,984 --> 01:20:52,349
It was Freddy.

1094
01:20:52,385 --> 01:20:54,717
My dad covered it up
to protect me.

1095
01:20:54,754 --> 01:20:55,721
He didn't do it.

1096
01:20:55,755 --> 01:20:57,279
Look, he has taken
everything from us!

1097
01:20:57,324 --> 01:20:59,656
He has ruined
both of our pasts...

1098
01:20:59,693 --> 01:21:03,060
and I am not leaving
until I see him die!

1099
01:21:31,791 --> 01:21:33,622
Man the torpedoes.

1100
01:21:57,751 --> 01:21:59,378
Hey, asshole!

1101
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:02,547
Up here!

1102
01:22:09,162 --> 01:22:10,959
Aha!

1103
01:22:28,048 --> 01:22:29,413
Yeah.

1104
01:22:40,093 --> 01:22:41,924
Ah, give me a break.

1105
01:23:07,654 --> 01:23:09,087
Oh, no.

1106
01:23:09,122 --> 01:23:13,081
Ohh, noooo!

1107
01:24:37,177 --> 01:24:39,111
Lori, get the tanks!

1108
01:24:42,849 --> 01:24:44,111
Give it up!

1109
01:25:11,411 --> 01:25:12,969
Freddy!

1110
01:25:14,581 --> 01:25:15,912
Go to hell!

1111
01:27:05,024 --> 01:27:06,958
It's OK. It's OK.

1112
01:27:38,358 --> 01:27:39,985
You...

1113
01:28:11,824 --> 01:28:14,725
Welcome to my world, bitch!
