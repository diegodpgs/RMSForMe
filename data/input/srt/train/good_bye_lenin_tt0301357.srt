OUR HOLIDAY HOME, SUMMER '78

6
00:00:47,533 --> 00:00:51,366
Look here. Here into the camera.

7
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:57,366
Hands off!

8
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,615
- Alex, hold on!
- Dad, help me!

9
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:32,485
<i>Slowly, cautiously,
almost gently...</i>

10
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:38,275
<i>the giant colossus...
is placed on the launch site.</i>

11
00:02:38,276 --> 00:02:42,317
<i>Here on the launch site
the result of the great...</i>

12
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:47,812
<i>community work is demonstrated. If you want
an example to emphasize the famous word:</i>

13
00:02:47,845 --> 00:02:50,472
<i>- everyone supplies quality to everyone...</i>
- There he is!

14
00:02:50,512 --> 00:02:53,859
<i>...here it can be seen in perfection.</i>

15
00:02:55,539 --> 00:03:00,985
<i>I report: I am ready for the flight
with spaceship Soyuz 31...</i>

16
00:03:01,032 --> 00:03:04,691
<i>as a member of the international
crew.</i>

17
00:03:04,816 --> 00:03:08,642
<i>On August 26, 1978,
we had reached international standing.</i>

18
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:15,898
<i>Sigmund Jähn, citizen of the GDR, was the
first German who ever went into space.</i>

19
00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:18,856
<i>However, on this day our
family went really up in smoke.</i>

20
00:03:18,857 --> 00:03:22,940
This is your husband's third
stay in a capitalistic country.

21
00:03:22,982 --> 00:03:25,609
He stands in for his
boss, professor Klinger.

22
00:03:25,662 --> 00:03:28,355
Do you know of any contacts in the
West your husband might have?

23
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:29,816
No.

24
00:03:30,356 --> 00:03:35,148
Mrs Kerner, how would you
describe the state of your marriage?

25
00:03:37,561 --> 00:03:40,163
Has your husband ever talked to you
about escape from the Republic?

26
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:44,731
Mrs Kerner...
Has he talked to you about that?

27
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:53,013
<i>Allow me to present the Central Committee
of the communist party...</i>

28
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:56,188
Get lost! Leave me alone!

29
00:03:57,517 --> 00:04:01,642
<i>While Sigmund Jähn bravely represented
the GDR in the depths of space,</i>

30
00:04:02,184 --> 00:04:07,584
<i>my procreator let a class enemy in a
capitalistic country screw his brains out.</i>

31
00:04:07,637 --> 00:04:09,854
<i>He never came back.</i>

32
00:04:12,562 --> 00:04:16,508
<i>My mother became so sad,
that she stopped talking.</i>

33
00:04:16,537 --> 00:04:21,329
<i>She just didn't talk anymore.
Not to us, not to others.</i>

34
00:04:29,364 --> 00:04:34,156
Mum, please come back.
It's so boring at Mrs. Schäfer's.

35
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:39,241
Mum, I love you.

36
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:56,470
<i>The Sandman excellently adapted to the
conditions in space.</i>

37
00:04:56,592 --> 00:05:03,893
<i>But the biggest surprise was that he
became very well acquainted with Mascha.</i>

38
00:05:04,018 --> 00:05:07,878
<i>We even had a cosmic
marriage on board.</i>

39
00:05:07,904 --> 00:05:13,849
<i>In a few minutes, the sandman
and Mascha will come back to Earth.</i>

40
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:19,349
<i>I hope it was relayed,
so that you could see it clearly.</i>

41
00:05:20,094 --> 00:05:24,773
<i>Mother came back after 8 weeks.
It was as if she had been transformed.</i>

42
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:27,974
- Surprise!
- My sweeties!

43
00:05:33,549 --> 00:05:37,568
My Alex. My little cosmonaut.

44
00:05:56,317 --> 00:05:58,417
PIONEER PARK, SPRING '79

45
00:05:57,617 --> 00:06:01,210
We never talked about father again.

46
00:06:01,247 --> 00:06:05,993
From this moment on, my mother got married

54
00:06:39,645 --> 00:06:44,010
<i>A passionate activist for the

<i>artists and veteran workers
came to Berlin today,</i>

61
00:07:12,576 --> 00:07:18,326
<i>to receive the highest honouring of
our country in the Council of State.</i>

62
00:07:18,653 --> 00:07:21,236
That's you, Mum!

63
00:07:21,392 --> 00:07:25,932
<i>...and recognition of outstanding
merits during the building up...</i>

<i>and development
of the socialist social order.</i>

65

<i>On the eve of the
national holiday...</i>

66
00:07:33,138 --> 00:07:38,391
<i>the CC of the SUG traditionally
rewards men and women of merit.</i>

67
00:07:39,641 --> 00:07:44,139
<i>After a long, untiring training
it was time. I, Alex Kerner,</i>

68
00:07:44,327 --> 00:07:48,639
<i>was the second German to go to space.
Deeper and further than any man before.</i>

69
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,640
Rocket launched!

70
00:07:52,557 --> 00:07:57,181
<i>I imaged how I would explore the riddles
of the cosmos for the good of humanity,</i>

71
00:07:57,223 --> 00:08:02,843
<i>how I would look down to our planet and
how I would proudly wave to my mother.</i>

72
00:08:02,872 --> 00:08:05,372
Rocket launched!

73
00:08:24,652 --> 00:08:28,178
10 years later - October 7, 1989.

74
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:32,304
<i>Test, one, two...</i>

75
00:08:33,165 --> 00:08:34,989
<i>The GDR had its 40th anniversary.</i>

76
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:38,849
<i>I had a day off with the
PGH TV workshop "Adolf Hennecke"...</i>

77
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:42,809
<i>and felt as if I was on the climax
of my male personal magnetism.</i>

78
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,234
Left, two, three!

79
00:08:57,906 --> 00:09:01,135
<i>Time smelt of change,
while an oversized rifle association...</i>

80
00:09:01,136 --> 00:09:04,889
<i>had its last performance
in front of our house.</i>

81
00:09:18,328 --> 00:09:19,561
Alex!

82
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,103
What?

83
00:09:25,455 --> 00:09:29,633
Alex, there's a lass out there.
Should I send her away?

84
00:09:30,114 --> 00:09:32,280
- Who is she?
- No idea.

85
00:09:32,287 --> 00:09:33,907
But she makes a good impression.

86
00:09:39,306 --> 00:09:42,384
Have you slept in your clothes again?

87
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,008
Where's the visitor?

88
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,949
The visitor's name is Paula...
and it's a date, as agreed. Here you are.

89
00:09:48,982 --> 00:09:51,982
- Oh no!
- Oh yes, little brother.

90
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:56,924
- Can't your ex-boyfriend take care of her?
- He's on standby duty today.

91
00:10:13,804 --> 00:10:18,179
We stopped at: "But a
woman of a certain age..."

92
00:10:19,506 --> 00:10:23,673
"...can't and won't wear the panties,
that are offered."

93
00:10:23,715 --> 00:10:28,548
Full stop. "Even in the GDR, there
are not only young princesses on ice..."

94
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:32,755
- "and exquisitely slim comrades." Full-stop.
- That's good.

95
00:10:32,964 --> 00:10:37,129
- You're not downstairs? It's already started.
- Impossible to overhear!

96
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,790
Well hurry up then. It could be
the last time with these members.

97
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:44,328
- Where's Paula?
- Yeah, where is she? Sleeping again?

98
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:49,255
- Maybe I'll see your mother on TV.
- In the palace?

99
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:53,170
You'll have to look for her
with a magnifying glass.

100
00:10:54,838 --> 00:10:59,462
I don't really know if I'll go there.
All of the party's bigwigs are there.

101
00:10:59,671 --> 00:11:01,604
I don't know anyone.

102
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:06,118
Although... I'd like to see
Gorbachev at close range this once.

103
00:11:06,504 --> 00:11:10,117
There they are celebrating themselves,
all the old bastards.

104
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:14,661
- Well you don't have to watch.
- Mum, don't you notice what's happening there?

105
00:11:14,712 --> 00:11:17,836
And you, what do you want? Do a bunk?

106
00:11:18,669 --> 00:11:23,460
Nothing will change if
they all go away. Let's go on.

107
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:29,127
It cannot be possible,
that the stouter...

108
00:11:29,316 --> 00:11:33,441
workers and farmer's wives...
are punished by the fashion combinations...

109
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:37,489
after the 40th year of the existence
of our Republic!

110
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:40,543
With socialist salutations...

111
00:11:40,668 --> 00:11:43,376
Hanna Schäfer.

112
00:11:51,981 --> 00:11:54,728
In the evening of October 7, 1989

113
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:58,555
several hundred people
united for an evening walk,

114
00:11:58,641 --> 00:12:02,534
to promote the idea of
walking without borders.

115
00:12:02,607 --> 00:12:06,847
Freedom of the press! Freedom of the press!

116
00:12:06,908 --> 00:12:10,221
Freedom of the press! Press...

117
00:12:30,123 --> 00:12:33,123
Cough! Cough hard!

118
00:12:34,914 --> 00:12:36,998
Everything alright?

119
00:12:39,414 --> 00:12:42,414
- You alright?
- Thank you!

120
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,780
There're even more Greens.

121
00:12:58,513 --> 00:13:00,288
Yeah yeah, all right.

122
00:13:02,954 --> 00:13:05,685
Form a chain!

123
00:13:05,732 --> 00:13:09,066
No violence! No violence!

124
00:13:12,037 --> 00:13:16,829
You might make it
if you take the subway.

125
00:13:28,369 --> 00:13:30,494
What's your name?

126
00:13:30,536 --> 00:13:32,202
La...

127
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,506
Stop it!

128
00:14:14,284 --> 00:14:15,566
Watch out!

129
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,321
- That's my mum lying there!
- Stand still!

130
00:14:35,347 --> 00:14:37,139
My mum's lying there!

131
00:14:52,406 --> 00:14:56,573
Let me go, you asshole!
That's my mu...

132
00:15:26,404 --> 00:15:29,404
- Alexander Kerner?
- Yes?

133
00:15:35,445 --> 00:15:37,528
Your mother.

134
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:34,650
What about mother?

135
00:16:37,965 --> 00:16:39,444
What is it?

136
00:16:41,245 --> 00:16:43,458
Mum had a heart attack.

137
00:16:44,185 --> 00:16:47,103
Unfortunately, the resuscitation
attempts were carried out very late.

138
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:49,029
Your mother's in a coma.

139
00:16:53,773 --> 00:16:57,940
- When can we talk to her?
- Alex, Mum's in a coma!

140
00:16:59,411 --> 00:17:03,577
Mr. Kerner, we don't know yet, whether or
not your mother will ever wake up again.

141
00:17:35,646 --> 00:17:36,959
Can you hear me, Mum?

142
00:17:39,812 --> 00:17:42,139
You've got to wake up!

143
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,923
<i>But mother was fast asleep.</i>

144
00:17:45,656 --> 00:17:48,323
<i>In her deep, never-ending sleep...</i>

145
00:17:48,356 --> 00:17:50,812
<i>she circled like a satellite
around the events happening...</i>

146
00:17:50,854 --> 00:17:56,270
<i>on our little planet
in our even smaller republic.</i>

147
00:17:58,201 --> 00:18:02,602
<i>The 9th Convention agreed to Honecker's
request, to relieve him of his duties...</i>

148
00:18:02,603 --> 00:18:07,602
<i>because of health problems and thanked
him for his political life's work.</i>

149
00:18:08,336 --> 00:18:09,809
<i>Congratulations!</i>

150
00:18:09,863 --> 00:18:13,518
<i>Her sleep obscured the retirement of
the esteemed comrade Erich Honecker,</i>

151
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:19,476
<i>General Secretary of the CC of the SUG
and Chairman of the GDR's council of state.</i>

152
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:26,476
<i>Berlin.
This evening the Wall fell.</i>

153
00:18:26,893 --> 00:18:31,100
<i>♪ Unity and justice and liberty... ♪</i>

154
00:18:31,101 --> 00:18:35,054
<i>Mother slept through a classical concert
at the City Hall of Schöneberg.</i>

155
00:18:36,843 --> 00:18:41,657
<i>And the start of a gigantic
and unique waste collection.</i>

156
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:50,152
Open the gateway! Open the gateway!

157
00:18:50,186 --> 00:18:53,599
Stasi begone! Stasi begone!

158
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,600
<i>Mother kept on sleeping. Deeply and firmly.</i>

159
00:18:59,112 --> 00:19:01,812
<i>She missed my
first trip into the West,</i>

160
00:19:01,888 --> 00:19:07,059
<i>and how some comrades conscientiously
protected us workers and peasants.</i>

161
00:19:08,925 --> 00:19:14,285
<i>Of course she also missed my first
cultural discoveries in a new country.</i>

162
00:19:17,098 --> 00:19:19,973
Excuse me, excuse me.

163
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:26,388
<i>Mothers deep sleep didn't allow her
to participate in the first free polling.</i>

164
00:19:26,428 --> 00:19:30,248
Helmut! Helmut! Helmut! Helmut!

165
00:19:30,315 --> 00:19:32,302
Helmut! Helmut!

166
00:19:32,335 --> 00:19:35,277
<i>She missed how Ariane gave up her study
of economic theory...</i>

167
00:19:35,317 --> 00:19:38,170
Enjoy your meal and thank you
for choosing Burger King.

168
00:19:38,197 --> 00:19:41,617
<i>...and made her first practical experience
with the circulation of money.</i>

169
00:19:41,684 --> 00:19:44,631
<i>The sleep saved her the
moving-in of Ariane's new boyfriend.</i>

170
00:19:44,657 --> 00:19:48,121
<i>Rainer, class enemy and barbecue man.</i>

171
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:53,636
The furniture from the bedroom
is going to the basement.

172
00:19:53,676 --> 00:19:58,336
<i>She missed the increasing Westernisation of
our 79-square-metre apartment...</i>

173
00:19:58,396 --> 00:20:03,137
The old rubbish with the red dot
is going to the bulk waste, okay?

174
00:20:05,248 --> 00:20:09,681
<i>...and Rainer's enthusiasm for the
oriental customs and way of life.</i>

175
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:19,114
<i>The big hormonal ecstasy
that I experienced watching</i>

176
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:23,325
<i>a few beautiful legs,
didn't reach into her night.</i>

177
00:20:33,026 --> 00:20:34,901
Shit!

178
00:20:41,593 --> 00:20:45,384
- What're you doing there?
- I... the infusion...

179
00:20:45,426 --> 00:20:49,800
<i>And not even the first day of Nurse Lara
exchange angel from the Soviet union,</i>

180
00:20:49,934 --> 00:20:52,292
<i>penetrated her black dreams.</i>

181
00:20:56,092 --> 00:20:59,092
- There you are again.
- Hello.

182
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:05,592
- I was worried about you.
- They've put me in prison.

183
00:21:20,007 --> 00:21:25,007
<i>- Mother overslept the triumph of the capitalism.</i>
- Relief!

184
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:37,042
<i>And the coordination of
my hospital visits.</i>

185
00:22:01,407 --> 00:22:02,981
<i>Do you know what I noticed?</i>

186
00:22:04,247 --> 00:22:07,241
When she's in a good mood, she's
carrying her hair loosely.

187
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:09,934
When she's in a bad mood, she puts them up.

188
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:14,795
<i>And during the doctor's round,
she chews on her fingernails.</i>

189
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,963
Don't you think
she's got a beautiful smile?

190
00:22:25,128 --> 00:22:29,341
<i>Her sleep ignored, how heroes
of work became unemployed.</i>

191
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:33,381
<i>The PGH TV workshop "Adolf Hennecke"
was winded up.</i>

192
00:22:33,588 --> 00:22:37,675
<i>I was the last one
and I switched off the light.</i>

193
00:22:37,868 --> 00:22:39,229
<i>Then there was the reprise.</i>

194
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:43,508
<i>As a member of the quick-witted East-West-Team,
I applied the reunification very early.</i>

195
00:22:43,554 --> 00:22:46,068
<i>Satellite dishes blossomed
in our landscape.</i>

196
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:48,681
Denis Domaschke?

197
00:22:49,376 --> 00:22:52,501
Domaschke. Denis Domaschke.

198
00:22:55,394 --> 00:22:58,393
- Alexander Kerner?
- Here.

199
00:22:58,741 --> 00:23:01,834
Well, come on. Don't be shy.

200
00:23:01,876 --> 00:23:03,542
Hi.

201
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:07,375
And get along, guys.

202
00:23:07,918 --> 00:23:10,626
- Hi.
- Hello.

203
00:23:16,459 --> 00:23:19,167
Knut Vogel?

204
00:23:22,974 --> 00:23:26,833
<i>Hello, Mum. Doctor Wagner said
we should talk to you.</i>

205
00:23:27,427 --> 00:23:30,999
<i>And if I can't be there in person,
I thought it might work like this too.</i>

206
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:35,166
<i>It's 5 o' clock now.
Most of the doctors are gone</i>

207
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:39,332
<i>and you've finally got some peace.
Nurse Lara, who's washed you,</i>

208
00:23:39,373 --> 00:23:44,139
<i>should be gone too. If you could see her
you'd surely wake up.</i>

209
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:48,866
<i>Ariane sends you her regards, she thinks the idea
with the tape is nonsense. Well, you know her.</i>

210
00:23:48,933 --> 00:23:53,728
<i>She's just in the room taking care of Paula who's
getting her teeth and is screaming all the time.</i>

211
00:23:53,908 --> 00:23:57,155
<i>Mother overslept my
unstoppable progress with Lara.</i>

212
00:23:57,248 --> 00:24:03,289
<i>Our first romantic rendezvous followed
4 early shifts and 35 late shifts.</i>

213
00:24:25,861 --> 00:24:27,944
It's loud here!

214
00:24:46,711 --> 00:24:49,536
Our Russian teacher came from Minsk
and weighed a ton.

215
00:24:49,684 --> 00:24:53,850
And that's all you know
about Russian women?

216
00:24:59,827 --> 00:25:03,951
<i>The wind of change blew
into the ruins of our Republic.</i>

217
00:25:03,993 --> 00:25:08,493
<i>Summer came and Berlin was
the most beautiful place on Earth.</i>

218
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,400
<i>We felt like
being in the centre of the world.</i>

219
00:25:11,432 --> 00:25:16,057
<i>Where finally something moved.
And we moved with it.</i>

220
00:25:16,992 --> 00:25:21,034
It's too bad she doesn't
realize any of this.

221
00:25:21,804 --> 00:25:23,671
Well, maybe it's better that way.

222
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:28,310
Everything she believed in has dissolved
into air in a few months. Just like that.

223
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:29,963
And your dad?

224
00:25:31,203 --> 00:25:32,470
He was a Doctor.

225
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:37,824
He escaped into the West.
We haven't heard anything from him again.

226
00:26:20,822 --> 00:26:25,614
<i>The future was in our hands,
uncertain and promising.</i>

227
00:26:34,196 --> 00:26:37,279
Good afternoon. We're X TV
and we just wanted to...

228
00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:41,829
Hello, do you need a satellite dish?

229
00:26:43,016 --> 00:26:44,229
No money?

230
00:26:45,489 --> 00:26:46,682
Good afternoon!

231
00:26:46,716 --> 00:26:50,069
Do you like football? Then
we've got something for you.

232
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:52,986
Good afternoon. We're X TV and...

233
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:57,153
We're X TV!
Are you interested in a satellite dish?

234
00:26:57,195 --> 00:27:01,403
This is Vietnam 1, there's Vietnam 2 and
back there's the Vietnamese sport channel.

235
00:27:02,197 --> 00:27:03,417
Alright!

236
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,381
To the World Cup!

237
00:27:09,407 --> 00:27:12,260
- To the future!
- To us!

238
00:27:12,611 --> 00:27:14,486
Comrade!

239
00:27:23,818 --> 00:27:27,859
At the moment this is just running
on the side.

240
00:27:29,652 --> 00:27:33,984
And later...
I'll do real feature films.

241
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,817
Same label of course.

242
00:27:40,484 --> 00:27:43,692
Watch this, I'll just
show you something.

243
00:27:46,025 --> 00:27:49,775
That's what I'm working on at the moment.
Watch this!

244
00:27:51,441 --> 00:27:55,191
Don't look yet.
Don't look yet, wait...

245
00:27:56,524 --> 00:27:59,233
And... now!

246
00:28:15,617 --> 00:28:17,024
Recognized it?

247
00:28:30,481 --> 00:28:32,356
Now!

248
00:28:37,272 --> 00:28:40,897
That's the famous cut from 2001,
the one with the bone.

249
00:28:40,939 --> 00:28:44,063
The cake represents the spaceship.

250
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:51,938
- Got it now? Yes?
- Ingenious.

251
00:29:03,812 --> 00:29:05,895
Ingenious.

252
00:29:10,603 --> 00:29:13,629
All right, everybody laugh.

253
00:29:13,656 --> 00:29:18,977
<i>At the beginning of June 1990, the borders
of our GDR were worthless.</i>

254
00:29:23,644 --> 00:29:28,310
<i>Mother kept on sleeping. But I
remembered the old words of the comrades:</i>

255
00:29:28,352 --> 00:29:32,519
<i>"We solve problems by making headway"
and I acted.</i>

256
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:09,933
Mum?

257
00:30:11,391 --> 00:30:13,266
Mum!

258
00:30:15,266 --> 00:30:17,974
Can you hear me?

259
00:30:23,658 --> 00:30:25,818
Your mother's awakening is a wonder.

260
00:30:25,844 --> 00:30:28,432
But she might not be the same
person she used to be.

261
00:30:28,811 --> 00:30:29,865
What do you mean?

262
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:34,391
There have been some cases in which the patients
didn't recognize their own children: amnesia.

263
00:30:35,348 --> 00:30:38,056
Loss of memory.

264
00:30:38,515 --> 00:30:40,598
Sorry.

265
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,348
Mental confusion. Blending of
long and short-term memory...

266
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:49,361
Taste and smell irritations,
delayed perception. We don't know,

267
00:30:49,428 --> 00:30:55,222
how badly the brain was damaged.
There are a lot of uncertain possibilities.

268
00:30:55,263 --> 00:30:59,156
I'm sorry to have to say this,
but mother is still in great danger.

269
00:31:01,347 --> 00:31:07,221
I'm afraid I can't give you much hope
that she'll survive the next few weeks.

270
00:31:15,054 --> 00:31:16,929
Well...

271
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,637
Can we take... her home with us?

272
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:26,553
Out of the question.
She is in very good hands here.

273
00:31:26,595 --> 00:31:30,999
It's also simpler for you.
She can't take another heart attack.

274
00:31:31,085 --> 00:31:35,386
You have to keep your mother away from any
excitement, even any danger of excitement.

275
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:39,928
And I mean
any form of excitement, Mr. Kerner!

276
00:31:39,969 --> 00:31:42,678
Any excitement.

277
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:46,718
It's life-threatening.

278
00:31:47,344 --> 00:31:50,968
And this?

279
00:31:51,129 --> 00:31:53,137
Isn't this a reason to get upset?

280
00:31:54,197 --> 00:31:58,468
My mother doesn't know anything about the Fall of the
Wall. She'll find out about that here immediately.

281
00:32:02,093 --> 00:32:04,967
Your granddaughter.

282
00:32:04,968 --> 00:32:07,467
Mummy.

283
00:32:12,467 --> 00:32:15,634
- What's happened?
- You collapsed.

284
00:32:16,672 --> 00:32:19,380
8 months ago.

285
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,508
8... months ago?

286
00:32:25,841 --> 00:32:28,966
I can't... remember.

287
00:32:29,132 --> 00:32:33,924
That's normal. It will come back to you.
You just have to have patience.

288
00:32:33,966 --> 00:32:36,966
And what... what happened?

289
00:32:39,258 --> 00:32:42,382
- Well, that was...
- It was October.

290
00:32:42,465 --> 00:32:45,144
I think you wanted to go shopping.

291
00:32:45,191 --> 00:32:48,897
You wanted to go shopping and... there
was a big queue in front of the store.

292
00:32:48,931 --> 00:32:54,131
- And it was so hot, you just collapsed.
- In October?

293
00:32:55,078 --> 00:32:59,243
It was a really hot October.
Back then.

294
00:33:00,005 --> 00:33:01,673
Yes.

295
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:04,214
And then?

296
00:33:04,964 --> 00:33:07,964
You were in a coma, Mum.

297
00:33:12,808 --> 00:33:15,808
I want to go home.

298
00:33:16,421 --> 00:33:18,963
That I promise you.

299
00:33:19,004 --> 00:33:23,044
We want to celebrate your birthday.
As every year.

300
00:33:23,077 --> 00:33:27,177
- Alex, that's complete madness.
- We don't leave her alone, we promised her.

301
00:33:27,224 --> 00:33:32,251
Mum is fatally ill. It's better for
her here. They've got the equipment.

302
00:33:32,498 --> 00:33:36,058
- Just this once, be realistic.
- No, you be realistic.

303
00:33:36,112 --> 00:33:38,565
What happens when she
doesn't have a single room anymore?

304
00:33:38,591 --> 00:33:40,428
Or when someone
lets the cat out of the bag?

305
00:33:40,545 --> 00:33:45,003
She'll hear what is happening
outside in here. She won't take it.

306
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:50,795
All right, all of this
rubbish has to come out.

307
00:33:52,586 --> 00:33:56,574
- Are mum's curtains still in the basement?
- You can't be serious.

308
00:33:56,886 --> 00:33:58,106
They're ragged.

309
00:34:00,273 --> 00:34:03,939
- Oh great!
- Guess it'll have to be re-plastered.

310
00:34:04,579 --> 00:34:08,159
- Can you please tell me what he's doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

311
00:34:08,192 --> 00:34:09,426
What should I think?

312
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:12,246
- What should he think?
- That you have to make way.

313
00:34:12,299 --> 00:34:16,332
- Or should we put Mum in the basement?
- Excuse me, I've paying the rent for this flat for 5 months!

314
00:34:16,372 --> 00:34:18,272
- Generous of you, Rainer!
- For the whole apartment!

315
00:34:18,298 --> 00:34:22,373
47,80 German Mark! In the West that's
not even enough for a telephone bill!

316
00:34:22,413 --> 00:34:24,646
And in the East you have to wait 10
years to get a telephone connection!

317
00:34:24,673 --> 00:34:25,813
Can't you just...?

318
00:34:25,866 --> 00:34:29,292
Mum has to find the room in the same
condition she left it in. The doctor said

319
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:33,458
she has to stay in bad okay? Good.
So it's only about this one room.

320
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:38,635
- And when she's better, we'll see what we'll do.
- You didn't get what the doctor said. Mum will probably...

321
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:42,542
That's what you said 3 months ago,
when you wanted to switch off the machines.

322
00:34:42,582 --> 00:34:47,374
- That was a different situation, you can't compare this!
- What do you want to tell her then, Ariane?

323
00:34:47,874 --> 00:34:52,624
That you've given up your studies,
because you're selling hamburgers now?

324
00:34:52,852 --> 00:34:57,286
"Enjoy your meal and thank you
for choosing Burger King."

325
00:35:10,982 --> 00:35:12,955
- 8th floor?
- Yeah.

326
00:35:13,282 --> 00:35:14,496
Elevator, hm?

327
00:35:14,688 --> 00:35:16,121
- Broken.
- Shit.

328
00:35:16,202 --> 00:35:18,701
You can say that again.

329
00:35:55,297 --> 00:35:57,597
<i>My life changed drastically.</i>

330
00:35:57,664 --> 00:36:00,443
And the day we wanted to take mum
home...

331
00:36:00,497 --> 00:36:04,451
was drawing nearer with the
relentlessness of a big Russian tank.

332
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:08,777
- What're you doing sniffling in my cupboard?
- Not in your cupboard. That's from the old clothes collection.

333
00:36:08,892 --> 00:36:14,224
And how do you look? It would be nice if
you would think a little for a change.

334
00:36:14,807 --> 00:36:17,785
Look at this. This garbage
is what we used to wear.

335
00:36:21,827 --> 00:36:24,493
Sign here.

336
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:28,702
The physiotherapist is coming 3 times a
week. Have you got any more questions?

337
00:36:28,743 --> 00:36:33,909
Your mother is going at her own responsibility.
You know how I think about this.

338
00:36:34,223 --> 00:36:37,034
Where is the previous Doctor, by the way?

339
00:36:37,076 --> 00:36:41,242
- Doctor Wagner, he went to Düsseldorf.
- I understand. And you?

340
00:36:42,403 --> 00:36:46,283
When do you run away? And you want
to lecture me about responsibility.

341
00:36:51,158 --> 00:36:54,283
Please lie down a second.

342
00:36:55,258 --> 00:36:59,008
- Why?
- Please. Just lie down.

343
00:37:06,408 --> 00:37:10,614
If there's another cardiac arrest:
short, strong thumps on the chest.

344
00:37:14,513 --> 00:37:18,031
- Careful! She mustn't wake up.
- Alright, boss!

345
00:37:18,073 --> 00:37:22,614
Ariane and I'll set up a schedule.
And there's the physiotherapist.

346
00:37:22,656 --> 00:37:25,823
There's always someone with her.
It'll work.

347
00:37:25,864 --> 00:37:31,217
<i>Most GDR citizens already exchanged
their savings cashless.</i>

348
00:37:31,257 --> 00:37:36,357
<i>There are only 2 weeks left. You should
hurry. Because as Gorbachev once said:</i>

349
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:37,822
- Excuse me?
<i>- He who is late...</i>

350
00:37:37,863 --> 00:37:39,370
will be punished all his life.

351
00:37:39,396 --> 00:37:40,947
- I can't hear it anymore.
- Excuse me!

352
00:37:40,989 --> 00:37:44,475
Could you tune down the radio please?
My mother needs rest.

353
00:37:44,494 --> 00:37:45,815
All right, boss.

354
00:37:52,113 --> 00:37:57,529
- Don't you want to introduce us?
- Oh yes, of course. This is Lara.

355
00:37:57,571 --> 00:37:59,654
Hello, Lara.

356
00:38:13,445 --> 00:38:15,439
Could you let me past, please?

357
00:38:20,278 --> 00:38:22,986
Hello, Christiane!

358
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,860
Alex! What is it?

359
00:38:27,364 --> 00:38:29,402
Hello? Alex!

360
00:38:41,466 --> 00:38:44,318
Nothing's changed in here.

361
00:38:45,568 --> 00:38:48,651
What should have changed?

362
00:38:48,973 --> 00:38:52,818
Oh, if you're bored,
you can listen to cassettes.

363
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,984
I'm afraid the radio receiver is broken.

364
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:59,276
- But I'll repair that.
- Alex?

365
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:08,567
It's good to know
you're not alone.

366
00:39:10,983 --> 00:39:13,983
When your father...

367
00:39:17,503 --> 00:39:20,503
When he was suddenly gone...

368
00:39:21,566 --> 00:39:24,265
I didn't think I'd make it.

369
00:39:30,523 --> 00:39:33,523
I never told you that...

370
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:41,731
I thought about laying hands upon myself.

371
00:39:47,022 --> 00:39:50,148
But you visited every day.

372
00:39:50,438 --> 00:39:54,605
And you talked about
school and Sigmund Jähn.

373
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:57,730
You heard that?

374
00:40:01,379 --> 00:40:05,479
I'm sorry to cause you so much work.

375
00:40:05,893 --> 00:40:09,521
- I can't even use the toilet by myself.
- Mum.

376
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:12,937
That doesn't matter.

377
00:40:13,062 --> 00:40:15,698
The important thing is for you to get well.

378
00:40:17,645 --> 00:40:20,354
I'll try hard.

379
00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:23,967
You have to rest now.

380
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:30,228
I'll just go to the shop,
but Ariane is still there.

381
00:40:31,353 --> 00:40:34,019
Oh, Alex...?

382
00:40:34,061 --> 00:40:38,602
I'm craving for Spreewood gherkins.
Can you fetch me some?

383
00:40:38,904 --> 00:40:41,185
No problem, Mum.

384
00:40:41,847 --> 00:40:43,650
<i>That's what I thought.</i>

385
00:40:47,227 --> 00:40:53,435
<i>At the end of June 1990 the shops of
our socialist Fatherland were emptied.</i>

386
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:58,351
<i>Real money was coming in from the country
behind the Wall.</i>

387
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:07,663
<i>While most citizens queued in long lines in front
of the Republic banks with their usual patience...</i>

388
00:41:07,702 --> 00:41:10,449
<i>we were still frantically
looking for mother's bankbook.</i>

389
00:41:23,683 --> 00:41:28,433
<i>Yearned for by everyone, the German
Mark flooded our little community.</i>

390
00:41:28,474 --> 00:41:31,974
♪ Hallelujah
Hallelujah ♪

391
00:41:32,016 --> 00:41:35,141
♪ Hallelujah, German Mark! ♪

392
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:39,974
♪ Such a day
So wonderful ♪

393
00:41:40,016 --> 00:41:44,136
<i>And the money was exchanged 2 to 1.
Germany won 1:0!</i>

394
00:41:44,604 --> 00:41:50,017
<i>Unstoppable shot!
Germany is one-nil up by Lothar Matthäus!</i>

395
00:42:03,823 --> 00:42:06,604
- Mocha Fix?
- Haven't got that anymore.

396
00:42:06,656 --> 00:42:09,783
- Filinchen Crisp-bread?
- Not for sale anymore.

397
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:12,180
- Spreewood gherkins?
- Goodness, where do you live, boy?

398
00:42:12,222 --> 00:42:16,763
We've got the German Mark now. And there you
come asking for Mocha Fix and Filinchen?

399
00:42:16,918 --> 00:42:22,835
<i>Overnight, our grey store was transformed
into a colourful product paradise.</i>

400
00:42:23,263 --> 00:42:26,346
<i>And I became the king as a customer.</i>

401
00:42:26,388 --> 00:42:29,138
They're from the Netherlands.

402
00:42:33,868 --> 00:42:36,576
Good afternoon, Mr. Ganske.

403
00:42:45,137 --> 00:42:50,430
That's how far they've driven us already...
that we have to go fishing in the garbage.

404
00:42:51,103 --> 00:42:54,469
Mister Ganske,
have you still got Spreewood gherkins?

405
00:42:54,511 --> 00:42:57,511
- What?
- Spreewood gherkins!

406
00:42:57,802 --> 00:43:01,969
I'm sorry, young man.
I'm unemployed myself.

407
00:43:04,598 --> 00:43:06,802
An empty glass would do, too.

408
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:35,508
I wanted to introduce Rainer to Mum today.

409
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:39,592
Later. We don't want to
demand to much of her.

410
00:43:44,508 --> 00:43:46,414
Perhaps you're right.

411
00:43:48,894 --> 00:43:50,299
Yes.

412
00:43:51,851 --> 00:43:55,757
I'm afraid there was a supply shortage
for Spreewood gherkins.

413
00:43:55,965 --> 00:43:59,090
It's alright. These are fine too.

414
00:44:03,424 --> 00:44:07,548
Listen, you really don't have to take
care of me all the time.

415
00:44:07,904 --> 00:44:10,590
- It's awkward for me.
- Mum.

416
00:44:10,715 --> 00:44:13,715
No, really. Maybe...

417
00:44:14,173 --> 00:44:19,256
you could put the TV next to the bed.
Then I'll manage by my own.

418
00:44:19,298 --> 00:44:23,691
- Watching TV still is too tiring for you.
- But why? Why shouldn't I...

419
00:44:23,724 --> 00:44:29,463
- be able to watch TV?
- We'll ask the Doctor.

420
00:44:31,245 --> 00:44:34,994
Mum, we have to talk to
you about something.

421
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:38,005
It's like this...

422
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:41,173
We wanted to ask you if...

423
00:44:41,196 --> 00:44:43,601
We need your authorization
to access your bank account.

424
00:44:45,046 --> 00:44:46,280
What is it?

425
00:44:47,344 --> 00:44:50,343
- Do you need money?
- No. No.

426
00:44:52,212 --> 00:44:56,336
It's just that you can't go walk
the bank by yourself anymore.

427
00:44:56,378 --> 00:44:59,503
And it would simply be better if...

428
00:45:00,304 --> 00:45:03,086
you sign this.

429
00:45:03,128 --> 00:45:05,836
Yes, and...

430
00:45:05,878 --> 00:45:08,878
maybe now would be best.

431
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,794
But there's no hurry is there?

432
00:45:20,422 --> 00:45:24,129
You're keeping something from me?

433
00:45:24,155 --> 00:45:25,609
Has something happened? Are you in debt?

434
00:45:25,649 --> 00:45:28,262
Please trust us, it's important!

435
00:45:28,312 --> 00:45:33,711
Before I let you have all my money, I have
got a right to know what it's for don't I?

436
00:45:35,305 --> 00:45:36,959
All right.

437
00:45:37,295 --> 00:45:40,228
It was supposed to be
a surprise but...

438
00:45:41,792 --> 00:45:45,542
We received a notification.

439
00:45:45,973 --> 00:45:50,187
From Zwickau. We can fetch our Trabant.

440
00:45:50,226 --> 00:45:52,487
After only 3 years?

441
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:55,066
And for that we need the money
that you've saved.

442
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,750
You don't think...
I got my money at the bank?

443
00:46:07,624 --> 00:46:10,623
I've hidden it.

444
00:46:11,657 --> 00:46:14,331
- And where?
- Where?

445
00:46:21,216 --> 00:46:22,676
I forgot.

446
00:46:26,373 --> 00:46:30,539
- I've totally forgotten, it's all gone.
- Mum, just think.

447
00:46:40,803 --> 00:46:44,830
Father is coming home late today,
don't you think?

448
00:47:10,061 --> 00:47:11,703
Mum...

449
00:47:13,474 --> 00:47:18,120
That's alright.
Soon you'll be better again.

450
00:47:20,529 --> 00:47:24,536
We'll celebrate your birthday.
As every year.

451
00:47:25,994 --> 00:47:30,785
With the house community.
We have always celebrated it.

452
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:39,909
<i>This is the First German Television
with the news.</i>

453
00:47:41,993 --> 00:47:44,993
Comrade Ganske watches West-TV?

454
00:47:50,685 --> 00:47:54,618
Comrade Ganske fell in love.
During a vacation in Hungary.

455
00:47:54,682 --> 00:47:57,807
With a pensioner from... Munich.

456
00:47:58,852 --> 00:48:01,783
Since then his love for
the Party has suffered.

457
00:48:02,029 --> 00:48:04,611
- Oh.
- Well...

458
00:48:06,792 --> 00:48:08,136
Are you finished?

459
00:48:12,199 --> 00:48:17,959
- I'm sorry I'm late again.
- There it is. Even with a balcony.

460
00:48:18,019 --> 00:48:21,699
<i>Since some citizens didn't even return
from their vacation in Hungary,</i>

461
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:25,137
<i>the apartment market in the
Capital eased considerably.</i>

462
00:48:25,162 --> 00:48:29,161
<i>There were deserted apartments everywhere,
which we only had to enter.</i>

463
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:32,937
The guy moved to the West last year.
A colleague gave me the hint.

464
00:49:31,047 --> 00:49:32,740
- Get a load of that!
- Get a load of that!

465
00:49:32,786 --> 00:49:35,173
- It's working!
- Tempo-beans!

466
00:49:35,986 --> 00:49:39,985
Globus green peas!
That can't be true.

467
00:49:40,553 --> 00:49:44,819
Mocha Fix Gold!
I've been looking for that all the time!

468
00:49:55,645 --> 00:49:56,872
Can I have that?

469
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,608
I have to go.

470
00:50:35,483 --> 00:50:38,191
Sleep on...

471
00:51:02,773 --> 00:51:05,147
Morning, Mum.

472
00:51:05,189 --> 00:51:07,897
Morning, Alex.

473
00:51:09,272 --> 00:51:12,397
- Are you in a hurry?
- I have to go to work.

474
00:51:12,707 --> 00:51:16,812
- Alex, please remember the TV.
- Let's talk about that later.

475
00:51:16,947 --> 00:51:22,812
Oh and about my birthday.
Invite Klapprath and perhaps a few pupils.

476
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:26,766
As if the fucking gherkins weren't enough
trouble already. Now she wants to watch TV.

477
00:51:26,825 --> 00:51:30,950
- What should I do?
- Yeah, Houston. We got a problem.

478
00:51:32,482 --> 00:51:35,782
- Yeah, and now?
- I thought you might have an idea.

479
00:51:35,808 --> 00:51:37,420
No, I meant the picture.

480
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:40,103
Oh.

481
00:51:45,546 --> 00:51:47,228
- Now?
- Nope.

482
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:52,436
- It didn't work very long.
- Semi-finale! I'll just go over to the Pollnicks.

483
00:51:52,478 --> 00:51:55,186
Then go already.

484
00:51:56,394 --> 00:52:00,269
Excuse me.
Are those gherkins from the Spreewood?

485
00:52:01,324 --> 00:52:03,164
Nope, from the Netherlands.

486
00:52:05,858 --> 00:52:08,983
- Just show her something old.
- What do you mean?

487
00:52:09,685 --> 00:52:12,769
Old East-TV stuff on video tape.

488
00:52:12,809 --> 00:52:16,393
News from last year?
She'll notice for sure.

489
00:52:16,435 --> 00:52:21,101
- Ah, I don't think so. It was always the same rubbish.
- Where should I get the videos from?

490
00:52:21,143 --> 00:52:24,726
- I haven't even got a recorder.
- Bad enough.

491
00:52:24,768 --> 00:52:26,975
What's the score?

492
00:52:27,017 --> 00:52:31,808
<i>Beckenbauer, Rudi Völler...
You don't want to see it...</i>

493
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:37,017
<i>Germany made it into the finale!</i>

494
00:52:39,975 --> 00:52:44,099
<i>While the world time clock at the Alexander
Square rushed towards mother's birthday,</i>

495
00:52:44,134 --> 00:52:48,528
<i>a tiny round ball united
the social development...</i>

496
00:52:48,581 --> 00:52:52,641
<i>of the split nation and let things,
that belonged together, grow together.</i>

497
00:52:52,701 --> 00:52:57,181
<i>I slaved away like a Hero of Labour
to resurrect the GDR in every detail</i>

498
00:52:57,234 --> 00:53:00,766
<i>in mother's room until this day.</i>

499
00:53:00,826 --> 00:53:03,240
Have the cross-word puzzles
already been solved?

500
00:53:03,539 --> 00:53:05,307
Untouched like a virgin.

501
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:08,348
Great. I'll take them all.

502
00:53:09,389 --> 00:53:12,389
Oh and these ones too.

503
00:53:13,473 --> 00:53:19,305
They laid my daughter off too. All of a
sudden it was: "Thank you, and goodbye."

504
00:53:19,306 --> 00:53:25,386
And for that we worked for 40 years, oh leave
me alone... They'll even drop the TV ballet.

505
00:53:25,472 --> 00:53:26,965
Don't you do anything
apart from watching TV?

506
00:53:26,985 --> 00:53:29,205
To get back to my mother.

507
00:53:30,905 --> 00:53:34,552
The problem is that she doesn't
know about the Fall of the Wall.

508
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:36,031
Enviable.

509
00:53:36,071 --> 00:53:41,264
And it's her birthday next week.
She would really be happy about a visit.

510
00:53:43,615 --> 00:53:47,889
Have you really got it now?
I don't want to hear one false word.

511
00:53:48,741 --> 00:53:51,162
- And our 20 Marks?
- The work comes first.

512
00:53:51,321 --> 00:53:56,181
<i>The first guests were invited.
Others still had to be persuaded.</i>

513
00:53:56,242 --> 00:53:59,487
<i>A lot of people of the Polytechnic
Secondary School "Werner Seelenbinder"...</i>

514
00:53:59,534 --> 00:54:04,220
<i>had withdrawn to their private lives.
Including Doctor Klapprath.</i>

515
00:54:04,261 --> 00:54:07,535
<i>Once headmaster and outstanding
teacher of the People.</i>

516
00:54:07,582 --> 00:54:11,082
We were all valuable people.

517
00:54:11,303 --> 00:54:13,802
Isn't that right, Alex?

518
00:54:15,302 --> 00:54:20,385
I admired your mother. She was
an outstanding educator.

519
00:54:20,427 --> 00:54:23,427
And an excellent human being.

520
00:54:23,956 --> 00:54:26,801
That's why she was neutralized.

521
00:54:29,362 --> 00:54:32,843
Some comrades in the collective
thought her to be too...

522
00:54:33,927 --> 00:54:36,635
idealistic.

523
00:54:36,842 --> 00:54:39,551
Ever since your father...

524
00:54:42,033 --> 00:54:45,009
Her idealism was well-respected, but...

525
00:54:46,967 --> 00:54:52,047
in the daily school routine, it...
can become problematic sometimes.

526
00:54:52,113 --> 00:54:55,238
And then you simply gave her the boot.

527
00:55:00,601 --> 00:55:04,257
- You still owe her something.
- Yes.

528
00:55:10,305 --> 00:55:13,612
- You're a Dispatcher. Can you remember that?
- Dispatcher? In the East?

529
00:55:13,665 --> 00:55:18,798
Yes, of course in the East. You organize
the purchasing of a Mitropa-Restaurant.

530
00:55:19,012 --> 00:55:23,428
Write this down:
School Education EOS Juri Gagarin.

531
00:55:23,789 --> 00:55:26,516
And you were Group Council
Chairman with the Pioneers.

532
00:55:26,742 --> 00:55:27,748
Group Council... what?

533
00:55:27,862 --> 00:55:30,548
- Group Council Chairman.
- That's enough.

534
00:55:30,574 --> 00:55:35,127
I won't use those plastic diapers anymore.
That's going too far.

535
00:55:38,027 --> 00:55:40,838
- Got it?
- Yes, Group Council Chairman.

536
00:55:41,396 --> 00:55:46,783
Here you are, 30 broadcasts of "Current
Camera", 10 broadcasts of "Black Channel"...

537
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:51,043
6 broadcasts "Colourful Boiler" and 4 broadcasts
of "A Day in the West". It's all copied.

538
00:55:51,116 --> 00:55:53,970
Sponsored by the country's picture library
and a very charming Denis.

539
00:55:53,989 --> 00:55:55,613
I hope that'll work.

540
00:55:59,171 --> 00:56:05,088
- What are you doing crawling on the ground?
- That's the cable for the antenna so you can watch TV.

541
00:56:14,961 --> 00:56:19,628
<i>We've got the World Cup. Truly a gift.
There is no better time to</i>

542
00:56:19,662 --> 00:56:23,595
<i>supply satellite dishes to the East.</i>

543
00:56:23,721 --> 00:56:26,846
<i>Okay? Got it? We come to phase 3...</i>

544
00:56:33,002 --> 00:56:37,169
- What was that?
- No idea. Interferences, happens from time to time.

545
00:56:37,377 --> 00:56:41,303
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
and welcome to the "Current Camera".</i>

546
00:56:41,363 --> 00:56:47,030
<i>Hard provocation against the border.
Protests in the Chancellor's office in the FRG.</i>

547
00:56:47,822 --> 00:56:51,875
<i>Chip-Power GDR. The foreign press
acknowledges achievements...</i>

548
00:56:51,948 --> 00:56:55,542
Things are running outside
and I feel so useless in here.

549
00:56:55,908 --> 00:56:59,709
Can't you put a note on the
house community's pin board?

550
00:56:59,751 --> 00:57:04,833
Whoever's got any problems can come to me.
I can write inputs from bed.

551
00:57:05,177 --> 00:57:09,042
I don't know.
You shouldn't exert yourself.

552
00:57:11,674 --> 00:57:15,424
Morning, Alex. Is it time already?

553
00:57:24,415 --> 00:57:28,415
- You want a swig? You want a swig?
- Oh holy shit!

554
00:57:30,645 --> 00:57:33,992
Shit. Shit, yes? Shit!

555
00:57:34,011 --> 00:57:37,136
Goodness, goddamn shit!

556
00:57:52,081 --> 00:57:54,789
I feel sick.

557
00:58:00,653 --> 00:58:04,287
<i>While many loudly thought of themselves
being the World Cup holders of tomorrow,</i>

558
00:58:04,308 --> 00:58:07,288
<i>sounds from the past

That was wonderful. Thank you.
Thank you, children.

568
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:02,159
You learned that from me, didn't you?

569
00:59:04,604 --> 00:59:06,270
Yes.

570
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,654
Dear Christiane!

571
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:16,067
We are here... today... here,

572
00:59:16,113 --> 00:59:20,766
because it's your birthday.
And... I would like to wish...

573
00:59:21,325 --> 00:59:26,531
in the name of the party direction
all the best.

574
00:59:27,158 --> 00:59:29,033
And...

575
00:59:30,407 --> 00:59:32,282
the basket.

576
00:59:34,789 --> 00:59:36,491
For you.

577
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:40,533
That's kind of you. Thank you.

578
00:59:42,407 --> 00:59:44,407
Klapprath.

579
00:59:44,449 --> 00:59:49,327
Rosenthaler Kadarka... Mocha Fix Gold...

580
00:59:49,865 --> 00:59:52,573
Globus green peas.

581
00:59:54,138 --> 00:59:57,937
The colleagues and... the comrades...

582
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:02,624
of the POS "Werner Seelenbinder"... they...

583
01:00:03,754 --> 01:00:07,921
would like to thank you in particular
for all the years,

584
01:00:08,687 --> 01:00:13,433
Christiane, that you... were...

585
01:00:13,863 --> 01:00:17,743
a... good colleague...

586
01:00:17,764 --> 01:00:20,764
and... a dear comrade...

587
01:00:22,416 --> 01:00:25,124
uhm...

588
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:31,250
And anyway, I wish you all the best for your
birthday and remain the same person you are...

589
01:00:31,268 --> 01:00:33,351
Christiane.

590
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:44,096
Dear comrade Kerner...

591
01:00:45,529 --> 01:00:48,528
All the best...

592
01:00:49,072 --> 01:00:51,780
and... good health...

593
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:56,120
and that everything will be
as it used to be again.

594
01:00:59,916 --> 01:01:02,624
Lara, come here.

595
01:01:06,944 --> 01:01:09,652
This is Lara.

596
01:01:09,952 --> 01:01:13,077
An exchange student from the Soviet Union.

597
01:01:13,995 --> 01:01:17,119
Her dad is a teacher for the deaf and dumb.

598
01:01:18,401 --> 01:01:22,151
- Don't marry him too early.
- Mum.

599
01:01:22,567 --> 01:01:26,609
Even though the thing with the flat
will work out earlier then.

600
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:32,162
My Alex can be
a real block-head sometimes.

601
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,025
And Rainer...

602
01:01:37,192 --> 01:01:40,942
that's my Ariane's new boyfriend.

603
01:01:41,525 --> 01:01:44,971
He... he is a...

604
01:01:45,436 --> 01:01:49,186
- Dispatcher.
- Right, I'm a Dispatcher.

605
01:01:50,302 --> 01:01:55,828
I used to be with them myself...
All the best from the heart... Pioneers!

606
01:01:56,262 --> 01:01:58,899
I used to be with the
Free German Pioneers...

607
01:01:58,941 --> 01:02:01,273
Thank you, Rainer.

608
01:02:01,315 --> 01:02:04,023
As a Group... um...

609
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,315
Cha...

610
01:02:06,524 --> 01:02:09,648
- Group Chairman... back then...
- Thank you!

611
01:02:11,478 --> 01:02:15,227
- Be ready, be ready!
- Thank you, Rainer!

612
01:02:19,048 --> 01:02:23,882
Yes, Mum. Another year is over.
What's changed?

613
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:29,526
Not much really.
Paula got her teeth and a new dad.

614
01:02:30,271 --> 01:02:32,313
And me... yes.

615
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:36,743
Unfortunately, we cannot go over to
the Café Moskow to drink to your health,

616
01:02:36,778 --> 01:02:40,777
but we're all together.
And that's the most important thing.

617
01:02:40,810 --> 01:02:44,810
We didn't always make it easy for you,
but you were always there for us.

618
01:02:45,063 --> 01:02:49,187
And, by any rate, I can't think of
a better family than ours.

619
01:02:49,402 --> 01:02:54,026
And that's what I wanted to thank you for.
Mum, you're the best mother in the world.

620
01:02:54,502 --> 01:02:56,979
- Alex?
- And we all love you.

621
01:02:57,147 --> 01:02:59,855
- Alex?
- What's the matter?

622
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:02,853
What's that?

623
01:03:05,446 --> 01:03:08,529
- That's...
- Yes, what's the meaning of that?

624
01:03:08,973 --> 01:03:11,733
I don't know what the comrades
are doing there again...

625
01:03:11,759 --> 01:03:12,602
A fata morgana.

626
01:03:12,644 --> 01:03:18,061
- That's from the West.
- It's a mirage.

627
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:26,851
- It will have been approved somehow.
- Please calm down, Mum!

628
01:03:26,893 --> 01:03:30,018
- There's an explanation for everything.
- Right...

629
01:03:31,726 --> 01:03:34,851
Boys, please sing something, will you?

630
01:03:35,343 --> 01:03:39,037
Lara! Wait a moment, I... Lara?

631
01:03:40,101 --> 01:03:43,850
"Build Up, Build Up".
"Build Up, Build Up".

632
01:03:46,325 --> 01:03:48,075
What's the matter all of a sudden?

633
01:03:48,210 --> 01:03:53,376
♪ Build up
For a better future ♪

634
01:03:53,693 --> 01:03:56,318
♪ We build up our home ♪

635
01:03:56,409 --> 01:04:01,825
I'm sorry for your mother.
What you're doing is too scary for me.

636
01:04:05,458 --> 01:04:08,349
And what is this nonsense about my father
being a teacher for the deaf and dumb.

637
01:04:08,391 --> 01:04:12,599
- He was a simple cook, you know that.
- But she rejoiced in that.

638
01:04:12,811 --> 01:04:18,057
What should I've told her?
That he's dead? In her state?

639
01:04:21,436 --> 01:04:25,309
You mean to say, when you're lying already,
it doesn't make any difference anyway.

640

646
01:04:56,589 --> 01:04:59,303
Just a little more..

647
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:03,156
- Watch out, will you? We're filming here!
- Can I see your authorization?

648
01:05:03,204 --> 01:05:06,953
- Didn't he inform you?
- Me? Who?

649
01:05:07,762 --> 01:05:10,846
- Oh, what was his name?
- Something with "M".

650
01:05:10,887 --> 01:05:15,053
I'll just go and ask around.
Until then, you don't film anything!

651
01:05:16,865 --> 01:05:19,172
- Got the logo?
- Yes.

652
01:05:19,257 --> 01:05:21,338
- Sharpness on me?
- Yes.

653
01:05:24,785 --> 01:05:28,025
- We're waiting for the evening sun.
- Don't overdo it, the guy will be back soon.

654
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:32,147
Just you wait. With the
evening sun it'll look great.

<i>When I stared at the clouds on that day,</i>

656

<i>I realized that the truth was
just a doubtful matter...</i>

657
01:05:39,567 --> 01:05:43,018
<i>that I could adapt to mother's
familiar surroundings.</i>

658
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:49,679

in the CC of the SUD,</i>

661
01:06:00,495 --> 01:06:04,800
<i>visited the Coca Cola group in West Berlin.
The reason for the comrade's visit are...</i>

662
01:06:04,842 --> 01:06:09,675
<i>details of the completed
trade agreement between Coca Cola...</i>

663
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:12,842
<i>and the VEB Drink
Collective Combine Leipzig.</i>

664

<i>Security officers of West Berlin hinder

<i>in the patent procedure too embarrassing...</i>

668

<i>- Please let the GDR television work undisturbed!
- That's it, I'm calling the police!</i>

671
01:06:42,548 --> 01:06:47,798

of the GDR. Back to the studio.</i>

672
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:51,589
Coca Cola is a socialist drink?

673
01:06:52,626 --> 01:06:55,506
I thought, Cola existed before the war.

674
01:06:55,547 --> 01:06:59,672
Don't you understand, Mum?
The West ripped us off all these years!

675
01:06:59,714 --> 01:07:03,839
<i>Until the end of August
593 deaths by drugs were registered.</i>

676
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:08,046
- 60% more than in the year before.
- Now I remember!

677
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:13,444
- What?
- Where I hid the money.

678
01:07:15,619 --> 01:07:19,032
In the living room. In the
small chest of drawers.

679
01:07:19,092 --> 01:07:21,546
In the left drawer
under the wax paper.

680
01:07:21,587 --> 01:07:25,020
The old rubbish with the red dot
is going to the bulk waste.

681
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:28,165
How could I forget?

682
01:07:34,087 --> 01:07:37,211
- Hey, here I am!
- Oh, hello!

683
01:07:40,924 --> 01:07:42,378
And?

684
01:07:44,244 --> 01:07:46,469
- Has she swallowed it?
- Yes, of course.

685
01:07:46,677 --> 01:07:47,637
Really?

686
01:07:47,711 --> 01:07:52,127
- Has she really swallowed it?
- I'm telling you.

687
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,740
- They've driven us this far!
- Good evening, Mister Ganske.

688
01:08:00,766 --> 01:08:03,757
They betrayed us and sold us out!

689
01:08:03,793 --> 01:08:06,466
- The lack of sharpness didn't irritate her?
- No.

690
01:08:06,493 --> 01:08:11,543
- And for that we worked 40 years...
- We could rebuild a studio.

691
01:08:11,584 --> 01:08:14,097
We would have different possibilities
with a blue box.

692
01:08:14,137 --> 01:08:15,790
They sold us out!

693
01:08:15,875 --> 01:08:18,583
What... what are you doing there?

694
01:08:35,416 --> 01:08:38,916
- And? What should we do with it?
- Exchange it, of course.

695
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:44,748
I'm sorry, but the deadline
expired 2 days ago.

696
01:08:45,457 --> 01:08:49,581
- But it's a special case.
- We've only just found it today.

697
01:08:49,623 --> 01:08:53,748
It's even okay for us,
if you exchange 1 to 4 or 1 to 5...

698
01:08:53,790 --> 01:08:59,410
I'm afraid there is no prolongation.
And we wouldn't have exchanged cash anyway.

699
01:08:59,523 --> 01:09:01,829
- That can't be!
- It has to be possible!

700
01:09:01,889 --> 01:09:06,676
- I'm sure you heard me. Time's up!
- Your time is up soon, you bastard!

701
01:09:06,749 --> 01:09:10,975
These are 30,000 East Marks! That
was our money, for 40 damned years!

702
01:09:11,022 --> 01:09:14,038
Now you Western fuck want to tell me,
this isn't worth anything?

703
01:09:14,293 --> 01:09:17,000
Please leave our premises now.

704
01:09:18,326 --> 01:09:22,026
Keep your hands off!
And what are you all gawking at?

705
01:09:22,066 --> 01:09:23,946
It used to be your money, too!

706
01:09:27,704 --> 01:09:30,538
Keep your hands off! You assholes!

707
01:09:37,137 --> 01:09:40,037
Are you going mad or what?

708

01:13:21,579 --> 01:13:24,020
You can't do anything right
with you Easties!

752
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,572
You always have something to complain about.

753
01:13:26,612 --> 01:13:29,679
You're just like your mother
and her stupid GDR-inputs.

754
01:13:29,725 --> 01:13:31,366
My mother doesn't grumble!

755
01:13:31,413 --> 01:13:35,351
She's trying to change the conditions of the society
step by step through constructive criticism.

756
01:13:35,385 --> 01:13:36,185
Sure.

757
01:13:36,269 --> 01:13:39,352
- And you were never interested in that!
- Nope.

758
01:13:39,918 --> 01:13:44,355
Haven't you noticed?
We're in the socialist veteran's club.

759
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:48,022
Good evening.
Why don't you take admission fees?

760
01:13:48,443 --> 01:13:50,397
Yeah, let's charge admission fees!

761
01:13:50,443 --> 01:13:54,771
- You be quiet. He's bought a Trabbi.
- Really?

762
01:13:55,313 --> 01:13:56,553
An estate car.

763
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:59,783
That can't be happening. Paula will get
a defect, if this goes on much longer.

764
01:14:00,013 --> 01:14:01,002
Oh come on!

765
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:04,645
20 years in the GDR didn't harm
our health, did they?

766
01:14:04,687 --> 01:14:07,812
I've really got my doubts about you.

767
01:14:08,354 --> 01:14:11,062
Shit. Shit!

768
01:14:16,228 --> 01:14:18,936
Well done. Get a cloth.

769
01:14:34,554 --> 01:14:37,679
What is it? Nosebleeds again.

770
01:14:44,628 --> 01:14:47,361
I know it's a little stressful
at the moment.

771
01:14:47,454 --> 01:14:53,404
- I'd also prefer if we didn't have to...
- I saw dad... earlier.

772
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,549
- Where?
- At work.

773
01:14:59,174 --> 01:15:02,018
I recognized his voice immediately.

774
01:15:02,307 --> 01:15:04,466
What did he say?

775
01:15:04,526 --> 01:15:08,892
<i>3 cheeseburgers and 2 portions of
chips with mayonnaise, please.</i>

776
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:17,104
Um, 3 cheeseburgers and
2 portions of chips with mayonnaise!

777
01:15:32,256 --> 01:15:35,255
And... what does he look like?

778
01:15:37,902 --> 01:15:42,307
He drives a Volvo estate car and
got glasses with a golden rim.

779
01:15:44,182 --> 01:15:47,182
What did you tell him?

780
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:52,707
"Enjoy your meal and thank you
for choosing Burger King."

781
01:15:55,976 --> 01:16:00,143
Enjoy your meal and thank you
for choosing Burger King.

782
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:29,762
<i>My father lived somewhere in this city.
I saw his image in my mind.</i>

783
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:36,119
<i>A fat guy who stuffed himself with
cheeseburgers and chips all day.</i>

784
01:16:43,852 --> 01:16:47,303
<i>He lived in his world and I in mine.</i>

785
01:16:47,344 --> 01:16:51,510
<i>He didn't have anything to do with me
and I not with him.</i>

786
01:17:00,378 --> 01:17:03,718
Hold still or it won't work.

787
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,885
Will it take much longer?

788
01:17:10,285 --> 01:17:14,452
'Cause I have to be home
in 2 hours at the latest.

789
01:17:15,071 --> 01:17:20,217
You always have to be somewhere in 2 hours.
It's getting boring.

790
01:17:21,264 --> 01:17:24,857
Oh great. I got a sick mother,
a demanding job...

791
01:17:24,902 --> 01:17:29,027
- and a miffed girlfriend.
- I've got my exams in 2 days.

792
01:17:29,383 --> 01:17:33,550
It's second nature to you.
This little bit of putting a plaster on.

793
01:17:33,876 --> 01:17:36,422
Then I can stop learning, can't I?

794
01:17:38,796 --> 01:17:42,632
I was well-meant.
I believe in you.

795
01:17:43,872 --> 01:17:46,424
Lara, stop this shit, please!

796
01:17:46,546 --> 01:17:49,670
- You have to tell your mother!
- What?

797
01:17:49,837 --> 01:17:55,046
You have to tell your mother!
Not because of me, but because of her!

798
01:17:58,918 --> 01:18:01,626
- Lara!
- What?

799
01:18:02,571 --> 01:18:04,881
Shit! Lara!

800
01:18:19,656 --> 01:18:23,149
<i>The life in our little country
became ever faster.</i>

801
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:28,699
<i>Somehow we were all just like atoms
in a big particle accelerator.</i>

802
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:32,879
<i>But away from all the frantic pace of the
new time there was a place of quiet,</i>

803
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:39,129
<i>silence and leisureliness,
where I could finally have a lie-in.</i>

804
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:46,962
Well, Paula. Alex didn't use to be
so tired when he came home from work.

805
01:18:54,628 --> 01:18:57,753
Our Paula's learning to walk, Alex!

806
01:19:03,419 --> 01:19:05,294
There! There!

807
01:19:25,293 --> 01:19:26,959
There!

808
01:19:31,792 --> 01:19:34,918
See? I can do it, too.

809
01:19:45,068 --> 01:19:47,776
Paula! See?

810
01:19:50,499 --> 01:19:55,291
My little Paula. Come to your Granny.
Come, come.

811
01:19:59,790 --> 01:20:03,957
Now we'll show Alex,
what we can do, okay?

812
01:20:04,582 --> 01:20:06,457
Right...

813
01:20:13,184 --> 01:20:17,165
Now let's see just how far
your Granny can walk.

814
01:21:10,655 --> 01:21:12,288
- Hi!
- Hi!

815
01:21:12,335 --> 01:21:13,409
Good afternoon.

816
01:21:26,607 --> 01:21:29,780
Young man, can I just sit down
for a moment here please?

817
01:21:29,826 --> 01:21:31,393
Of course.

818
01:21:41,079 --> 01:21:44,909
- You're not from here, are you?
- Nope, from Wuppertal.

819
01:21:45,326 --> 01:21:47,034
From the West?

820
01:22:56,363 --> 01:22:58,030
Mum?

821
01:23:58,942 --> 01:24:02,068
- Mum, what are you doing? Come on.
- Mum!

822
01:24:03,109 --> 01:24:09,025
What is it with you?
You can't just get up! Shit.

823
01:24:13,216 --> 01:24:16,216
What's actually happening here?

824
01:24:19,922 --> 01:24:24,801
Central Committee of the Socialist...
Unity Party of...

825
01:24:25,471 --> 01:24:28,180
Germany.

826
01:24:29,161 --> 01:24:31,941
- Sound is in order.
- Right.

827
01:24:32,474 --> 01:24:35,857
- Right. I'm ready.
- Camera running.

828
01:24:36,026 --> 01:24:38,481
3, 2, 1...

829
01:24:39,689 --> 01:24:41,689
Berlin.

830
01:24:51,928 --> 01:24:53,564
Still running.

831
01:24:54,102 --> 01:24:55,481
Berlin.

832
01:24:55,689 --> 01:25:00,772
In a historic special session of the Central
Committee of the Social Unity Party of Germany...

833
01:25:00,813 --> 01:25:06,181
<i>the General Secretary of the SUG's CC
and Chairman of the GDR's Council of State,</i>

834
01:25:06,234 --> 01:25:09,848
<i>Comrade Erich Honecker, in a great
matter of humanitarian politeness,</i>

835
01:25:09,894 --> 01:25:13,127
<i>consented to the entering of the
country by people from the FRG</i>

836
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:17,021
<i>who've been requesting exile at the GDR
embassies in Prague and Budapest.</i>

837
01:25:17,647 --> 01:25:19,127
<i>In this development, Honecker sees...</i>

838
01:25:19,147 --> 01:25:23,519
<i>a change in the East-West-relations and promised
every man and woman entering the country...</i>

839
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:26,781
<i>a welcome money of 200 East Marks.</i>

840
01:25:27,201 --> 01:25:30,520
<i>Unemployment,
bad future prospects...</i>

841
01:25:30,521 --> 01:25:34,519
<i>and the increasing election victories
of the neo-Nazi Republicans...</i>

842
01:25:34,701 --> 01:25:39,497
<i>made the unnerved FRG citizens
turn their backs</i>

843
01:25:39,550 --> 01:25:42,030
<i>on the capitalism to
try and start...</i>

844
01:25:42,049 --> 01:25:46,263
<i>a new life in the country
of workers and farmers.</i>

845
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:53,393
<i>Here they park,
the new GDR citizens from the FRG.</i>

846
01:25:53,465 --> 01:25:55,912
<i>The entering FRG citizens
were accommodated</i>

847
01:25:55,938 --> 01:25:59,304
<i>in the Berlin districts of Centre
and Friedrich's Grove.</i>

848
01:26:00,725 --> 01:26:07,645
<i>The CC of the SUG created the campaign
"Solidarity West" because of the historic situation,</i>

849
01:26:07,718 --> 01:26:12,226
<i>to make sure all the new citizens
receive proper living space.</i>

850
01:26:13,131 --> 01:26:16,647
<i>Somehow I have to admit
that my game started to break free.</i>

851
01:26:16,694 --> 01:26:21,414
<i>Maybe the GDR I created for my mother,
was the one I would have liked to have.</i>

852
01:26:21,447 --> 01:26:26,200
<i>Citizens who are ready
to accommodate a refugee from the FRG,</i>

853
01:26:26,245 --> 01:26:29,465
<i>please report to their
Section Plenipotentiary.</i>

854
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:34,350
How many are there already?

855
01:26:34,983 --> 01:26:37,724
I don't know. Ten, twenty thousand?

856
01:26:38,961 --> 01:26:42,432
Look at that.
The people want to come into our country.

857
01:26:43,168 --> 01:26:47,041
- Where are they all going to live?
- They'll find something.

858
01:26:47,094 --> 01:26:49,765
You've heard it, they're taking care of it.

859
01:26:51,279 --> 01:26:55,445
No, children. This is our responsibility.
We have to help.

860
01:26:56,015 --> 01:27:00,807
But how do you think we can?
I mean, there's no room left in here.

861
01:27:02,435 --> 01:27:05,560
- Our holiday home.
- Our holiday home?

862
01:27:06,841 --> 01:27:11,764
We could do it up.
I wanted to get out there anyway.

863
01:27:12,732 --> 01:27:19,190
Congratulations. You've done a great job.
Now she wants to go to the holiday home.

864
01:27:20,885 --> 01:27:24,596
You'll have to redecorate the entire City.
Why don't you start?

865
01:27:24,638 --> 01:27:27,185
But I'm telling you one thing,
I won't take this any further.

866
01:27:31,237 --> 01:27:37,096
Ariane and I'll get a bigger apartment.
In 4 weeks we're out of here.

867
01:27:37,491 --> 01:27:38,697
What?

868
01:27:39,874 --> 01:27:41,447
I'm pregnant.

869
01:27:47,626 --> 01:27:51,553
Again?
Can't you be more careful?

870
01:27:53,873 --> 01:27:56,620
Don't you think Paula is enough?

871
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:57,586
And Mum?

872
01:27:57,620 --> 01:28:02,969
- You can't leave me alone with her!
- Then take some refugees.

873
01:28:03,244 --> 01:28:07,410
You're so cynical.
You want her to die, don't you?

874
01:28:16,794 --> 01:28:22,210
<i>And so the unity of our little
family was restored.</i>

875
01:28:24,857 --> 01:28:28,844
That's your child. And this is the heart.

876
01:28:33,544 --> 01:28:35,926
Amazing!

877
01:28:36,738 --> 01:28:40,114
<i>An all-German baby was on its way.</i>

878
01:28:40,161 --> 01:28:43,228
<i>And all-German contracts were signed.</i>

879
01:28:43,281 --> 01:28:46,508
<i>In Moscow, they calculated
that 2 and 4 equals 1...</i>

880
01:28:46,554 --> 01:28:51,008
<i>and drank Krim Champagne
to all-German brotherhood.</i>

881
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:56,675
<i>In Berlin we took our
first all-German trip.</i>

882
01:29:02,052 --> 01:29:04,146
I'm not a little child anymore.
Please take off the cloth.

883
01:29:04,198 --> 01:29:06,906
Don't look!

884
01:29:07,767 --> 01:29:11,674
- Where are we going?
- The surprise stays a surprise!

885
01:29:13,211 --> 01:29:16,658
The Trabbi smells so new.
What colour does it have?

886
01:29:16,718 --> 01:29:19,824
You've waited 3 years, another half
an hour won't make a difference.

887
01:29:20,003 --> 01:29:21,976
That's right.

888
01:29:54,196 --> 01:29:55,837
Mum?

889
01:30:11,503 --> 01:30:15,001
Oh, it's beautiful. Sky-blue.

890
01:30:15,448 --> 01:30:18,002
Right, and now turn around.

891
01:30:22,243 --> 01:30:25,709
Oh my God. The garden.

892
01:30:25,923 --> 01:30:30,000
Remember the time Alex
locked himself in the bathroom?

893
01:30:30,001 --> 01:30:33,000
We knocked and knocked. Not a sound.

894
01:30:33,001 --> 01:30:37,335
I climbed out of a hole and watched
all the excitement from the tree.

895
01:30:37,377 --> 01:30:41,543
And I laughed so hard
I wet myself.

896
01:30:48,765 --> 01:30:53,292
What's happened in the 8 months
I overslept?

897
01:30:53,334 --> 01:30:56,042
- Is she asleep?
- Yeah.

898
01:31:00,077 --> 01:31:04,243
You've become adults,
that must be it.

899
01:31:04,999 --> 01:31:08,165
You look more and more like your father.

900
01:31:16,985 --> 01:31:17,485
Mum...

901
01:31:17,492 --> 01:31:22,332
I've lied to you all this time.
It's all different from what you think.

902
01:31:22,772 --> 01:31:25,659
- Mum, what are you talking about?
- Your father...

903
01:31:30,879 --> 01:31:35,046
Your father didn't stay in the West
because of another woman.

904
01:31:35,827 --> 01:31:40,785
I lied. And not hearing from him again...

905
01:31:43,914 --> 01:31:46,914
was also a lie.

906
01:31:47,744 --> 01:31:50,869
He wrote letters to me... and to you.

907
01:31:52,309 --> 01:31:56,059
They're all in the kitchen cupboard.

908
01:32:03,112 --> 01:32:07,832
They made things so hard for him.
Just because he wasn't in the party.

909
01:32:07,852 --> 01:32:12,644
It was dreadful.
He didn't let anyone notice.

910
01:32:14,069 --> 01:32:16,703
But I knew.

911
01:32:17,003 --> 01:32:21,000
I... knew
and I couldn't help him.

912
01:32:24,084 --> 01:32:28,875
And then... there suddenly was
this congress in West Berlin.

913
01:32:30,519 --> 01:32:34,269
We only had 2 days to think.

914
01:32:35,737 --> 01:32:39,651
Your father wanted to stay in
the West and I...

915
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:42,804
I was supposed to follow with you.

916
01:32:47,235 --> 01:32:50,948
Well, I couldn't do it.

917
01:32:53,642 --> 01:32:57,123
I... I was very frightened.

918
01:32:59,279 --> 01:33:02,673
You don't know, how it is.
Filling in an exit permit...

919
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:07,200
with 2 children. You can't get out
immediately. You have to wait. Endlessly!

920
01:33:07,242 --> 01:33:11,255
Sometimes even years. And you...

921
01:33:11,650 --> 01:33:15,816
They could have taken you away from me.
Do you understand?

922
01:33:22,461 --> 01:33:23,407
Yes.

923
01:33:26,667 --> 01:33:29,533
I didn't go.

924
01:33:32,147 --> 01:33:35,532
It was the worst mistake of my life.

925
01:33:35,839 --> 01:33:37,266
I know that now.

926
01:33:40,033 --> 01:33:43,365
I lied to you. Please forgive me!

927
01:34:05,688 --> 01:34:08,688
My dear Robert...

928
01:34:10,646 --> 01:34:13,771
I thought about you so often...

929
01:34:15,771 --> 01:34:19,521
I would so much like to
see you once more.

930
01:35:01,013 --> 01:35:03,393
<i>The same evening
mother's condition suddenly worsened.</i>

931
01:36:12,764 --> 01:36:16,972
Your mother had another heart attack,
just as I feared.

932
01:36:17,014 --> 01:36:21,180
At the moment, she's relatively stable.
But I'm afraid...

933
01:36:23,078 --> 01:36:27,138
we have to expect the worst.
I'm sorry.

934
01:36:34,186 --> 01:36:38,311
- The doctors can be wrong.
- Alex, don't lie to yourself.

935
01:36:38,888 --> 01:36:42,928
Here, I found it.
He lives in Wannlake.

936
01:36:45,915 --> 01:36:51,970
I know, it's her last wish.
But I couldn't bring myself to go there.

937
01:36:55,678 --> 01:36:58,678
Mum's not going to die.

938
01:37:02,261 --> 01:37:04,136
Bye.

939
01:37:43,295 --> 01:37:47,045
Now you can accommodate someone after all.

940
01:37:50,209 --> 01:37:52,591
Accommodate? Who?

941
01:37:52,961 --> 01:37:55,961
Someone from the West.

942
01:38:19,602 --> 01:38:22,310
You have to sleep.

943
01:38:25,131 --> 01:38:29,172
If you want you you can sleep
lie down in the nurses' room.

944
01:39:08,337 --> 01:39:11,462
<i>There he was. The idol of my youth.</i>

945
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:16,502
<i>Like a conjured spirit from
my childhood: Sigmund Jähn.</i>

946
01:39:16,503 --> 01:39:21,762
<i>He didn't give autographs, he didn't talk to
Pioneers about the secrets of the universe...</i>

947
01:39:21,802 --> 01:39:25,902
<i>the freedom you have in zero gravity
or the eternity of the cosmos.</i>

948
01:39:25,949 --> 01:39:31,115
<i>- He drove a small, stinking Lada-Taxi.</i>
- Where do you want to go?

949
01:39:32,109 --> 01:39:34,689
- To Wannlake.
- I know what you're thinking.

950
01:39:34,736 --> 01:39:38,543
That's what many people think.
But that's not who I am.

951
01:39:38,668 --> 01:39:43,520
<i>We were flying through the night.
Just like through the depths of the cosmos.</i>

952
01:39:43,574 --> 01:39:46,147
Light-years away from the solar system...

953
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:51,360
past strange galaxies with unknown
lifeforms, we landed in Wannlake.

954
01:39:51,611 --> 01:39:54,736
Could you wait a moment?

955
01:39:58,115 --> 01:40:00,824
I won't be long.

956
01:40:11,082 --> 01:40:14,082
- Good evening.
- Hello. Come in.

957
01:40:17,624 --> 01:40:19,564
Is Mr. Kerner there?

958
01:40:19,590 --> 01:40:21,398
- The buffet is outside.
- Over there.

959
01:40:27,525 --> 01:40:30,040
Hello.

960
01:40:39,289 --> 01:40:40,955
Good evening.

961
01:40:47,513 --> 01:40:49,388
Hello! Good evening!

962
01:40:52,997 --> 01:40:54,872
Hello!

963
01:41:00,954 --> 01:41:07,156
<i>♪ Sandman, dear Sandman
It isn't time yet ♪</i>

964
01:41:07,216 --> 01:41:11,742
<i>♪ We send the evening greetings ♪</i>

965
01:41:11,788 --> 01:41:15,245
<i>♪ Before all the children have to go to bed ♪</i>

966
01:41:15,329 --> 01:41:19,114
<i>♪ You surely have time left ♪</i>

967
01:41:21,748 --> 01:41:23,182
Hello.

968
01:41:23,208 --> 01:41:24,994
- Hello.
- Hello.

969
01:41:24,995 --> 01:41:29,036
- May I watch the Sandman with you?
- Only if you tell us your name.

970
01:41:29,078 --> 01:41:31,786
Alexander.

971
01:41:37,410 --> 01:41:41,452
Look,
today the Sandman is an astronaut.

972
01:41:42,496 --> 01:41:45,077
Where I come from it's called "cosmonaut".

973
01:41:45,118 --> 01:41:49,160
- Where do you come from?
- From a different country.

974
01:41:52,233 --> 01:41:54,906
- Hi, you little bears.
- Hello, Dad.

975
01:41:54,966 --> 01:41:58,117
Hello. How are you?

976
01:41:58,284 --> 01:42:00,992
Fine.

977
01:42:03,534 --> 01:42:06,659
So, are you also a fan of the Sandman?

978
01:42:06,875 --> 01:42:08,195
Yes, I am.

979
01:42:13,241 --> 01:42:17,408
- Excuse me, do we know each other?
- Yes, we do.

980
01:42:18,783 --> 01:42:22,533
Yes. I can't think of it.
Please help me.

981
01:42:22,949 --> 01:42:25,658
His name's Alexander.

982
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:34,907
Alex?

983
01:42:38,324 --> 01:42:43,871
Robert. Robert!
We're all waiting for you out here.

984
01:42:43,904 --> 01:42:46,114
Robert, come out!

985
01:42:46,156 --> 01:42:50,781
Robert, we all know that you like to hide
in the bathroom on these occasions.

986
01:42:56,989 --> 01:43:01,405
- Dad, you have to give your speech.
- Robert, come out here.

987
01:43:01,447 --> 01:43:04,447
I'll be back.

988
01:43:09,718 --> 01:43:13,738
Oh, I see him.
You've kept us waiting.

989
01:43:15,030 --> 01:43:18,030
Onto the stage!

990
01:43:23,153 --> 01:43:27,486
Well, I thank you
all for coming here.

991
01:43:27,487 --> 01:43:29,987
Thank you and...

992
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:35,237
enjoy the evening. Thanks.

993
01:43:45,527 --> 01:43:49,653
I'm sorry for having this
party here tonight.

994
01:43:49,694 --> 01:43:53,444
Had I known you'd come, I...

995
01:43:57,205 --> 01:44:01,110
Strange, I've always thought you've got
a swimming pool.

996
01:44:01,152 --> 01:44:07,068
We've got a lake nearby.
My God, I didn't even recognize you.

997
01:44:13,791 --> 01:44:17,400
Now I got 2 new brothers and sisters, hm?

998
01:44:26,150 --> 01:44:31,525
For 3 years, every day I waited
for a message from you.

999
01:44:31,566 --> 01:44:33,441
Every day.

1000
01:44:35,113 --> 01:44:37,673
It was my most fervent wish.

1001
01:44:49,816 --> 01:44:52,816
Why have you come?

1002
01:44:58,440 --> 01:45:01,440
Mum's dying.

1003
01:45:02,689 --> 01:45:05,689
She had a heart attack.

1004
01:45:06,481 --> 01:45:09,481
She wants to see you once more.

1005
01:45:26,146 --> 01:45:29,979
- What was it like up there?
- Up there?

1006
01:45:33,799 --> 01:45:36,508
Oh... up there.

1007
01:45:39,388 --> 01:45:42,388
It was wonderful up there.

1008
01:45:42,947 --> 01:45:46,071
Just very far away from home.

1009
01:45:52,603 --> 01:45:56,770
The Wall is no more.
There's no frontier!

1010
01:45:57,329 --> 01:46:00,269
It's not that bad.
It's all just one country now!

1011
01:46:01,061 --> 01:46:05,228
- I don't understand a word. It's all untrue.
- That's why you have to play along.

1012
01:46:06,917 --> 01:46:09,384
And why did I come back to the GDR?

1013
01:46:09,429 --> 01:46:11,864
I don't know. Just think of something!

1014
01:46:16,933 --> 01:46:19,467
No, it's absurd. I can't do that.

1015
01:46:19,932 --> 01:46:22,920
You just have to overcome it,
then it'll be easy.

1016
01:46:49,891 --> 01:46:52,600
- Mum.
- Yes.

1017
01:46:53,016 --> 01:46:54,891
Ouch.

1018
01:47:21,390 --> 01:47:24,098
I want to get up.

1019
01:47:24,598 --> 01:47:27,306
How do I look?

1020
01:47:37,290 --> 01:47:38,750
You can go in now.

1021
01:47:42,398 --> 01:47:46,055
- And please remember, not a word!
- Yes, yes.

1022
01:47:56,388 --> 01:48:01,804
- What did you talk about?
- Is that important?

1023
01:48:17,178 --> 01:48:21,344
- How long has he been in there?
- More than an hour.

1024
01:48:25,719 --> 01:48:28,843
I hope he doesn't let
the cat out of the bag.

1025
01:48:31,969 --> 01:48:37,885
<i>The summer was over. I decided
to end the whole sham.</i>

1026
01:48:38,218 --> 01:48:43,176
<i>But once more we were about to celebrate the
anniversary of our socialist Fatherland.</i>

1027
01:48:43,218 --> 01:48:47,926
<i>But in contrast to reality...
as a dignified farewell.</i>

1028
01:49:01,624 --> 01:49:03,175
Psst!

1029
01:49:12,299 --> 01:49:15,424
Yes? Camera running. Start at 3.

1030
01:49:21,674 --> 01:49:26,840
Dear citizens of the
German Democratic Republic.

1031
01:49:27,474 --> 01:49:31,620
If you've lived to see the wonder
of watching our blue planet...

1032
01:49:31,661 --> 01:49:34,286
from the depths of the cosmos...

1033
01:49:45,570 --> 01:49:49,986
<i>As mum could hardly wait,
we simply moved the GDR's anniversary...</i>

1034
01:49:50,055 --> 01:49:55,471
<i>from October 7 to October 2, 1990:
The eve of the reunification.</i>

1035
01:50:17,188 --> 01:50:18,629
And?

1036
01:50:19,045 --> 01:50:22,170
Here. My best film yet, buddy.

1037
01:50:23,495 --> 01:50:26,503
Too bad no one but your mother
will ever see it.

1038
01:50:26,545 --> 01:50:28,472
Thank you, Denis. Without
you, it would never...

1039
01:50:28,498 --> 01:50:30,018
Yeah, it's alright. Here you go.

1040
01:50:30,051 --> 01:50:33,176
Zoom off, before it gets sentimental.

1041
01:50:34,670 --> 01:50:36,919
And tell me how it was!

1042
01:50:36,961 --> 01:50:42,607
<i>On the occasion of today's annual anniversary
of the GDR, Erich Honecker resigned...</i>

1043
01:50:42,641 --> 01:50:45,252
<i>from all his functions.</i>

1044
01:50:45,418 --> 01:50:47,085
What?

1045
01:50:47,168 --> 01:50:52,074
<i>We ensure our friends in the world
that the socialism...</i>

1046
01:50:52,121 --> 01:50:55,668
<i>In his speech on the ceremony for
the GDR's anniversary...</i>

1047
01:50:55,709 --> 01:51:00,282
<i>in the Republic's palace, Erich Honecker
justified his decision by saying that</i>

1048
01:51:00,342 --> 01:51:04,000
<i>the changes achieved in the
GDR in the past few months...</i>

1049
01:51:04,042 --> 01:51:07,028
<i>completed his political life's work.</i>

1050
01:51:07,128 --> 01:51:11,328
<i>Erich Honecker congratulated the
new SED's CC General Secretary...</i>

1051
01:51:11,367 --> 01:51:13,807
<i>and Chairman of the GDR's council of state:</i>

1052
01:51:13,847 --> 01:51:16,417
<i>- Sigmund Jähn.</i>
- What, Jähn?

1053
01:51:16,542 --> 01:51:21,958
<i>In 1978, Sigmund Jähn was the first German
cosmonaut in space.</i>

1054
01:51:22,715 --> 01:51:27,999
<i>The new head of state addressed the
GDR's population in the evening.</i>

1055
01:51:30,007 --> 01:51:36,215
<i>Dear citizens of the
German Democratic Republic.</i>

1056
01:51:36,592 --> 01:51:40,457
<i>If you've lived to see the wonder
of watching our blue planet...</i>

1057
01:51:40,499 --> 01:51:45,915
<i>from the depths of the cosmos,
you see things differently.</i>

1058
01:51:47,165 --> 01:51:51,455
<i>Up there, in the depths of
space, the people's lives...</i>

1059
01:51:51,456 --> 01:51:56,955
<i>seem small and insignificant. You ask
yourself what humanity has accomplished.</i>

1060
01:51:56,956 --> 01:52:01,455
<i>Which objectives did we set,
which objectives did we realize?</i>

1061
01:52:02,116 --> 01:52:04,747
<i>Today is our country's anniversary.</i>

1062
01:52:04,789 --> 01:52:08,580
<i>It's a very little country,
seen from the cosmos.</i>

1063
01:52:08,622 --> 01:52:12,746
<i>But still thousands of people
came to us last year.</i>

1064
01:52:12,788 --> 01:52:18,261
<i>People who we looked to as enemies and
who want to live here with us today.</i>

1065
01:52:18,328 --> 01:52:21,854
<i>We know our country is not perfect.</i>

1066
01:52:21,963 --> 01:52:26,407
<i>But what we believe in, inspired a
lot of people in the whole world.</i>

1067
01:52:27,371 --> 01:52:31,495
<i>Maybe we have drifted off course
from time to time.</i>

1068
01:52:31,537 --> 01:52:35,662
<i>But we collected ourselves.</i>

1069
01:52:35,704 --> 01:52:40,328
<i>Socialism doesn't mean living behind a wall.
Socialism means reaching out to others...</i>

1070
01:52:40,370 --> 01:52:43,230
<i>and living with others.</i>

1071
01:52:43,269 --> 01:52:47,055
<i>Not just to dream about a better world,
without making it come true.</i>

1072
01:52:48,953 --> 01:52:52,953
<i>I have therefore decided
to open the GDR borders.</i>

1073
01:52:54,452 --> 01:53:00,298
<i>Shortly after the Fall of the Wall, thousands
of FRG citizens seized the opportunity...</i>

1074
01:53:00,358 --> 01:53:04,291
<i>to visit the GDR for the first time.</i>

1075
01:53:08,947 --> 01:53:12,632
<i>Many want to stay. They're looking
for an alternative to...</i>

1076
01:53:12,672 --> 01:53:16,219
<i>the hard battle for survival
in the capitalistic system.</i>

1077
01:53:16,245 --> 01:53:17,326
<i>Isn't that wonderful?</i>

1078
01:53:17,368 --> 01:53:21,048
<i>Not everyone wants to join in with career
addiction and aggressive marketing.</i>

1079
01:53:21,067 --> 01:53:25,234
<i>Not everyone wants
to fight his way through life.</i>

1080
01:53:29,866 --> 01:53:34,346
<i>♪ Such a day
So wonderful like today ♪</i>

1081
01:53:34,799 --> 01:53:37,592
<i>These people want a different life.</i>

1082
01:53:37,639 --> 01:53:42,339
<i>They realize that cars, video
recorders and TVs are not everything.</i>

1083
01:53:42,365 --> 01:53:49,824
<i>They are ready to realize a new life with
nothing but good will, vigour and hope.</i>

1084
01:53:55,186 --> 01:53:57,061
Amazing.

1085
01:55:10,474 --> 01:55:13,610
<i>My mother survived the GDR
by 3 days.</i>

1086
01:55:14,367 --> 01:55:17,941
<i>I guess it was the right thing,
that she never did learn the truth.</i>

1087
01:55:18,006 --> 01:55:19,779
<i>She died happily.</i>

1088
01:55:22,776 --> 01:55:26,901
<i>She wished for us to
scatter her ashes to the four winds.</i>

1089
01:55:26,943 --> 01:55:32,860
<i>That's not allowed in Germany. Not in the
West and not in the East. But we didn't care.</i>

1090
01:56:07,982 --> 01:56:12,315
<i>Up there she is floating and
maybe she is looking down at us.</i>

1091
01:56:12,588 --> 01:56:16,481
<i>And sees us as tiny
dots on our little Earth.</i>

1092
01:56:16,523 --> 01:56:19,648
<i>Just like Sigmund Jähn back then.</i>

1093
01:56:21,964 --> 01:56:26,497
<i>The country my mother left
was a country she had believed in</i>

1094
01:56:28,460 --> 01:56:32,480
<i>and which we kept alive
until her last second.</i>

1095
01:56:33,460 --> 01:56:37,475
<i>A country that in fact
never existed like this.</i>

1096
01:56:39,413 --> 01:56:44,473
<i>A country that in my memory
will always be connected to my mother.</i>
