1
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,908
You know how blind I am without them.

2
00:01:33,086 --> 00:01:35,043
Howard, don't cry.

3
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:59,020
Murder.

4
00:02:31,725 --> 00:02:34,014
- Good luck, John.
- Any contractions?

5
00:02:34,186 --> 00:02:35,930
Only the ones you give me.

6
00:02:50,785 --> 00:02:53,573
- What's coming?
- Red Ball, double homicide.

7
00:02:53,747 --> 00:02:56,950
One male, one female.
Killer's male, white, 40s.

8
00:02:57,125 --> 00:03:01,952
Agatha nailed the time at 8:04 a.m.
The twins are a little fuzzy on that.

9
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:05,712
Location's still uncertain.
Remote witnesses are plugged in.

10
00:03:05,883 --> 00:03:08,635
This will be case number 1108.

11
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,799
Morning, detectives.

12
00:03:15,976 --> 00:03:19,179
Case number 1108,
previsualized by the Pre-Cogs...

13
00:03:19,355 --> 00:03:21,264
...recorded on holosphere
by Precrime's Q-stacks.

14
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,018
My fellow witnesses are Dr. Katherine
James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.

15
00:03:26,194 --> 00:03:27,226
Good morning.

16
00:03:27,404 --> 00:03:31,022
Will the witness preview and validate
1108 at this time?

17
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,156
<i>Affirmative. I will validate.</i>

18
00:03:33,326 --> 00:03:34,785
<i>Go get them.</i>

19
00:03:35,036 --> 00:03:37,823
- Standby.
- Time of murder: 8:04 a.m.

20
00:03:37,997 --> 00:03:42,375
That is 24 minutes, 13 seconds
from now. This is a Red Ball.

21
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,482
<i>You know how blind I am without them.</i>

22
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,032
All right, Howard Marks,
where are you?

23
00:04:15,867 --> 00:04:19,532
Howard? Howard, breakfast.

24
00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:37,461
Four score and seven years ago...

25
00:04:37,805 --> 00:04:40,925
- He looked familiar.
- Who?

26
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,136
A man standing in the park
across the street.

27
00:04:44,311 --> 00:04:46,600
- Seen him before.
- How can you tell?

28
00:04:46,772 --> 00:04:49,726
You're blind without your glasses.
Where are your glasses?

29
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,735
- In the bedroom.
- You're running out of time.

30
00:04:52,986 --> 00:04:54,860
<i>- You know how blind I am...</i>

31
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:13,081
I show eight Howard Markses in the
District. Sorting by race and age.

32
00:05:13,256 --> 00:05:18,083
Run their license and registration.
See if I can capture an address here.

33
00:05:20,096 --> 00:05:22,468
<i>I was thinking I'd stay home today.</i>

34
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,594
<i>- What about your meeting?
- I've been working too much.</i>

35
00:05:25,768 --> 00:05:28,685
- Can you grab that?
- It's unclear.

36
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:34,188
- Six licenses. Where do you want them?
- Over here, please.

37
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:58,005
<i>You know how blind I am without them.</i>

38
00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:05,339
Got him in the Foxhall.
4421 Gainsborough.

39
00:06:05,556 --> 00:06:08,759
Send DCPD. Set up a perimeter.
Tell them we're en route.

40
00:06:08,934 --> 00:06:12,801
I was thinking maybe I'd play hooky,
stay home today.

41
00:06:13,313 --> 00:06:17,097
- "We've come to dedicate a portion..."
- What do you think?

42
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:20,442
- What about your meeting?
- I'll reschedule.

43
00:06:20,612 --> 00:06:23,103
I've been working too much anyway.

44
00:06:24,115 --> 00:06:27,282
- "But in a larger s..." Good.
- We could have lunch together.

45
00:06:27,452 --> 00:06:29,824
- What do you say?
- "We cannot consecrate...

46
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:32,992
- I would love to.
- "The brave men, living and dead...

47
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,953
I have an open house
at the Ressler place.

48
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:40,540
- Have consecrated, far above our
poor power to add or detract. "

49
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,461
I guess that's why you look so nice.

50
00:06:45,136 --> 00:06:49,347
Chief! We got a problem
with our location.

51
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,517
- It's no longer there.
- Shit!

52
00:06:55,687 --> 00:06:57,680
- Time frame?
- Thirteen minutes.

53
00:06:57,856 --> 00:06:59,849
Investigator from the fed's here.

54
00:07:00,025 --> 00:07:02,480
I don't need some twink
from the fed poking around.

55
00:07:02,652 --> 00:07:04,195
I wrote it on your calendar.

56
00:07:04,362 --> 00:07:06,770
See if the neighbors knew
where they went.

57
00:07:06,948 --> 00:07:08,857
- Check all relations.
- Checking.

58
00:07:09,034 --> 00:07:13,363
Just get him some coffee,
tell him how I save your ass every day.

59
00:07:13,621 --> 00:07:15,032
I got coffee, thanks.

60
00:07:15,206 --> 00:07:17,875
Danny Witwer,
the twink from the fed.

61
00:07:18,042 --> 00:07:19,869
Oops. Gum?

62
00:07:20,044 --> 00:07:22,535
I'll give you the full tour
some other time.

63
00:07:22,713 --> 00:07:26,663
They moved two weeks ago. Nobody
knows where. Still searching for family.

64
00:07:26,842 --> 00:07:28,550
Time horizon, 12 minutes.

65
00:07:28,803 --> 00:07:30,879
He's scrubbing the image, looking for...

66
00:07:30,971 --> 00:07:33,343
...clues as to where
the murder will happen.

67
00:07:33,515 --> 00:07:38,676
Original running bond brick pattern,
Georgian details. Brick was repointed.

68
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:44,641
And that this nation, under God,
shall not perish from the earth.

69
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:47,523
Victims are pronounced here,
killers here.

70
00:07:47,696 --> 00:07:52,156
Beyond that, all we have to run on
are the images that they produce.

71
00:08:02,418 --> 00:08:05,253
- Show a cop on horseback.
- Near the Capitol?

72
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:08,090
- No Maglev system.
- The Mall?

73
00:08:09,008 --> 00:08:10,253
Georgetown.

74
00:08:10,468 --> 00:08:13,634
The Pre-Cogs can see a murder
four days out. Why the late call?

75
00:08:13,804 --> 00:08:18,265
A Red Ball. Crimes of passion have no
premeditation, so they show up late.

76
00:08:18,434 --> 00:08:22,976
Most of our scrambles are flash events.
We rarely see premeditation anymore.

77
00:08:23,146 --> 00:08:24,973
People have gotten the message.

78
00:08:25,148 --> 00:08:29,561
I show a match with Dwight Kingsley,
18th-century architect.

79
00:08:29,736 --> 00:08:34,149
- He did two dozen houses in D.C.
- Time horizon, 10 minutes.

80
00:08:39,495 --> 00:08:41,155
Look at this kid.

81
00:08:41,706 --> 00:08:44,375
In this one,
he's on the left side of the man.

82
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:46,120
Yes. So?

83
00:08:46,294 --> 00:08:48,120
This one he's on the right.

84
00:09:05,229 --> 00:09:07,138
Merry-go-round.

85
00:09:07,689 --> 00:09:09,065
It's a park.

86
00:09:12,694 --> 00:09:16,110
There's only 16 of these old
merry-go-rounds left in the city.

87
00:09:16,281 --> 00:09:18,986
Two in Georgetown, one in
Barnaby Woods, the others in Woodley.

88
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,780
It's gotta be Barnaby Woods.
Evanna, flight time?

89
00:09:21,953 --> 00:09:24,526
The way I drive?
Three minutes after wheels up.

90
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,469
- Clear.
- Clear.

91
00:09:59,531 --> 00:10:02,366
Time horizon, six minutes.

92
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:40,477
Let's go to bed.

93
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:42,736
Let's do it in here.

94
00:10:44,032 --> 00:10:47,365
- But the bed is soft.
- I'm soft.

95
00:11:33,371 --> 00:11:34,782
Shit.

96
00:11:36,415 --> 00:11:37,826
Which one is it?

97
00:11:44,465 --> 00:11:47,216
- Not the bed.
- Come on.

98
00:11:47,384 --> 00:11:49,673
I don't want to be on the bed.

99
00:11:53,098 --> 00:11:57,345
- We're catching up to the future.
- Shut up, Evanna. Jad?

100
00:11:57,853 --> 00:12:00,094
<i>- Jad?
- Go ahead.</i>

101
00:12:00,272 --> 00:12:03,059
<i>- Did he close the front door?
- What?</i>

102
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:05,688
Did Marks close the front door?

103
00:12:13,785 --> 00:12:15,195
Front door...

104
00:12:18,873 --> 00:12:21,328
I didn't wanna be on the bed.

105
00:12:25,713 --> 00:12:30,209
- Negative. The front door is open.
- Time horizon, 30 seconds.

106
00:12:37,683 --> 00:12:40,221
I forgot my glasses.

107
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:41,508
Howard.

108
00:12:53,364 --> 00:12:55,571
You know how blind I am without them.

109
00:12:57,035 --> 00:12:58,861
Howard, don't cry.

110
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,324
Marks!

111
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,258
Look at me. Look at me.

112
00:13:26,188 --> 00:13:28,346
Positive for Howard Marks.

113
00:13:28,523 --> 00:13:31,773
By mandate of the District of Columbia
Precrime Division...

114
00:13:31,943 --> 00:13:36,154
...you're under arrest for the future
murder of Mrs. Marks and Mr. Dubin...

115
00:13:36,322 --> 00:13:39,822
...that was to take place today
at 0800 hours and four minutes.

116
00:13:39,993 --> 00:13:43,907
- I didn't do anything. Sarah?
- Give the man his hat.

117
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,409
Oh, God.
Don't put that halo on me. Sarah!

118
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:53,162
- Put your hand on your head.
- Help me! I wasn't gonna do anything!

119
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:56,090
I'm Officer Scott with the
Precrime Trauma Response Unit.

120
00:13:56,258 --> 00:13:58,583
Sit here a minute and listen to me.

121
00:13:58,761 --> 00:14:01,631
Your husband is being arrested
by Precrime.

122
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:04,640
Oh, God, Howard, no.

123
00:14:04,975 --> 00:14:09,304
Howard, don't cry.
Howard, don't cry.

124
00:14:12,065 --> 00:14:17,059
Please, don't cry.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

125
00:14:19,239 --> 00:14:21,729
I thought they stopped the murder.

126
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,328
That's just an echo.
Pre-Cog déjà vu, if you will.

127
00:14:26,496 --> 00:14:29,781
The really bad ones
the Pre-Cogs see over and over again.

128
00:14:29,957 --> 00:14:32,199
Wally, erase the incoming.

129
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:50,016
<i>Imagine a world without murder.</i>

130
00:14:50,936 --> 00:14:52,975
<i>- I lost my best friend.
- I lost my aunt.</i>

131
00:14:53,188 --> 00:14:55,264
<i>- I lost my dad.
- I lost my wife.</i>

132
00:14:55,523 --> 00:15:00,150
<i>Just six years ago, the homicide rate
had reached epidemic proportions.</i>

133
00:15:00,487 --> 00:15:03,440
<i>It seemed that only a miracle
could stop the bloodshed.</i>

134
00:15:03,656 --> 00:15:07,868
<i>But instead of one miracle, we
were given three: The Pre-Cognitives.</i>

135
00:15:08,077 --> 00:15:10,864
<i>Within just one month
under the Precrime program...</i>

136
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,663
<i>... the murder rate in the District
of Columbia was reduced 90°%°.</i>

137
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,998
<i>- They were waiting for me.
- He was gonna rape me.</i>

138
00:15:17,211 --> 00:15:19,038
<i>- I was going to be stabbed.
- Right here.</i>

139
00:15:19,213 --> 00:15:23,756
<i>Within a year, Precrime effectively
stopped murder in our nation's capital.</i>

140
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:26,132
<i>In the six years of our experiment...</i>

141
00:15:27,512 --> 00:15:29,838
<i>... there hasn't been a single murder.</i>

142
00:15:30,015 --> 00:15:32,221
<i>And now Precrime can work for you.</i>

143
00:15:32,476 --> 00:15:35,346
<i>We want to make certain
that every American...</i>

144
00:15:35,562 --> 00:15:38,646
<i>... can bank on the infallibility
of the system.</i>

145
00:15:38,982 --> 00:15:44,356
<i>And to ensure that what keeps us safe
will also keep us free.</i>

146
00:15:45,697 --> 00:15:47,736
<i>- Precrime. It works.
- It works.</i>

147
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:49,324
<i>- It works.
- It works.</i>

148
00:15:49,492 --> 00:15:51,152
<i>- It works.
- It works.</i>

149
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:54,116
<i>Precrime. It works.</i>

150
00:15:54,372 --> 00:15:59,330
<i>On Tuesday, April 22, vote "yes"
on the National Precrime Initiative.</i>

151
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:05,754
What's the matter? Can't sleep?

152
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,888
- Just need a little clarity.
- True that.

153
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:19,225
You want the customary clarity or
the new and improved kind of clarity?

154
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,099
Give me the new stuff.

155
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:26,932
New and improved clarity.
Clarity, clarity. Yes, indeed.

156
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,862
Come on. Come on.

157
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:32,440
Don't bust my balls. You've only given
me four, and some of these are duds.

158
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:34,451
Sweet dreams, chief.

159
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,946
Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.

160
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,531
I could use a little juice on my side.

161
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,998
What do you think you know?

162
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,922
It's like my daddy used to say:

163
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,627
"In the land of the blind...

164
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:57,096
...the one-eyed man is king. "

165
00:17:18,244 --> 00:17:19,619
I'm home.

166
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,201
Overhead.

167
00:18:25,976 --> 00:18:27,007
Wall screen.

168
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:36,058
<i>- Sean.
- Hi, Daddy.</i>

169
00:18:36,611 --> 00:18:38,899
<i>Can you teach me how to run faster?</i>

170
00:18:39,072 --> 00:18:44,113
<i>Because all the kids in my class
run faster than me.</i>

171
00:18:44,535 --> 00:18:45,650
<i>That's good.</i>

172
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,111
Keep your knees up.

173
00:18:48,873 --> 00:18:51,909
Like that. Like that.
High. High. Like that.

174
00:18:52,459 --> 00:18:55,745
<i>- See, you're a natural runner.
- Gotta keep running.</i>

175
00:18:55,963 --> 00:18:58,833
Yeah. Gotta keep running.

176
00:18:59,591 --> 00:19:01,169
Gotta keep running.

177
00:19:02,135 --> 00:19:06,465
<i>- Will I be as fast as you someday?
- Oh, I think you'll beat me someday.</i>

178
00:19:06,848 --> 00:19:10,383
<i>- You're gonna beat everybody.
- I think you'll beat everyone someday.</i>

179
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,846
<i>- I gotta go. Bye.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait.</i>

180
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:16,809
<i>- You gotta give me a kiss.
- Not on the lips.</i>

181
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,603
<i>Only Mommy kisses me on the lips.</i>

182
00:19:20,778 --> 00:19:22,272
<i>Yeah, all right. All right.</i>

183
00:19:22,864 --> 00:19:24,239
I love you.

184
00:19:24,782 --> 00:19:28,151
<i>- I love you, Sean.
- I love you, Daddy.</i>

185
00:20:03,277 --> 00:20:05,566
<i>Reminds me of Rosarito Beach.</i>

186
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,520
<i>Remember?</i>

187
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:11,989
<i>We had 20 dollars and...</i>

188
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:16,907
<i>Waiting in that van so the sun
would shine on our vacation.</i>

189
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:23,331
<i>John. John. John,
put the camera down.</i>

190
00:20:23,505 --> 00:20:28,665
<i>Look, I'm all ready for bed.
What is this? No. Put it away.</i>

191
00:20:28,844 --> 00:20:31,299
<i>It's time to put the camera
to sleep...</i>

192
00:20:31,471 --> 00:20:34,805
<i>... and time to come
and take care of your wife.</i>

193
00:20:37,268 --> 00:20:42,892
<i>Why don't you put the camera down
and come and watch the rain with me?</i>

194
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:47,148
<i>No? I promise I'll make it
a memorable moment.</i>

195
00:20:51,198 --> 00:20:54,698
<i>Put the camera down
or you're not getting anything tonight.</i>

196
00:21:36,283 --> 00:21:39,699
A gentleman at Justice
wants to take this away from us.

197
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:42,657
In a week, people will vote
on whether or not...

198
00:21:42,831 --> 00:21:46,165
...what we've been doing has been
a noble-minded enterprise...

199
00:21:46,335 --> 00:21:49,704
...or a chance to change the way
this country fights crime.

200
00:21:49,963 --> 00:21:51,244
John...

201
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,217
...watch this Danny Witwer,
the observer from Justice.

202
00:21:56,386 --> 00:21:59,303
- I met him yesterday.
- Let him look around.

203
00:21:59,472 --> 00:22:01,761
Answer his questions,
but watch him.

204
00:22:01,933 --> 00:22:04,768
If there's any problem,
make sure we know about it.

205
00:22:05,562 --> 00:22:09,262
When the Pre-Cogs declare a killer,
their name is embedded in the wood.

206
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,102
Since the shape and grain of each piece
is unique, they're impossible to forge.

207
00:22:14,278 --> 00:22:18,027
You understand the legalistic
drawback to Precrime methodology.

208
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:20,950
- Here we go again.
- I'm not with the ACLU on this...

209
00:22:21,118 --> 00:22:23,787
...but we arrest individuals
who've broken no law.

210
00:22:23,954 --> 00:22:26,623
- They will.
- The commission is metaphysics.

211
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:29,542
The Pre-Cogs see the future,
and they're never wrong.

212
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,501
But it's not the future if you stop it.

213
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:35,121
- Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
- Yes.

214
00:22:35,298 --> 00:22:39,248
You're talking about predetermination,
which happens all the time.

215
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,671
- Why'd you catch that?
- It was gonna fall.

216
00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:46,094
You're certain?

217
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:48,717
But it didn't fall. You caught it.

218
00:22:50,313 --> 00:22:53,646
Preventing it doesn't change
the fact that it was going to happen.

219
00:22:53,816 --> 00:22:56,224
You ever get any false positives?

220
00:22:56,402 --> 00:23:01,443
Someone intends to kill, but doesn't.
How do the Pre-Cogs tell the difference?

221
00:23:01,615 --> 00:23:05,483
They don't see what you intend to do,
only what you will do.

222
00:23:05,661 --> 00:23:08,615
Why can't they see
rapes, assaults, suicides?

223
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:10,828
Because of the nature of murder.

224
00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:14,368
Nothing's more destructive to the
metaphysical fabric that binds us...

225
00:23:14,545 --> 00:23:18,589
...than the untimely murder of a human.
- That wasn't Walt Whitman.

226
00:23:18,757 --> 00:23:23,502
Iris Hineman. She developed Pre-Cogs,
designed the system and the interface.

227
00:23:23,678 --> 00:23:26,596
Speaking of interfacing,
I'd love to say hello.

228
00:23:26,765 --> 00:23:30,180
- To Hineman?
- To them.

229
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:35,306
- Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
- You've never been inside?

230
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:38,897
We keep strict separation so that
no one can be accused of tampering.

231
00:23:39,068 --> 00:23:43,315
- I'll be the first one to go in then?
- Maybe you didn't hear me.

232
00:23:43,531 --> 00:23:47,363
- If it's a question of authority...
- There is no question.

233
00:23:47,535 --> 00:23:49,361
You don't have any.

234
00:23:49,745 --> 00:23:52,865
I have a warrant in my pocket
that says different.

235
00:24:04,426 --> 00:24:07,462
- Show it to me.
- Sure.

236
00:24:12,642 --> 00:24:15,477
This investigation of Precrime
and its personnel is conducted...

237
00:24:15,645 --> 00:24:20,271
...under the direct supervision and
permission from the attorney general.

238
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:22,726
I'm here as his representative...

239
00:24:22,902 --> 00:24:26,982
...which means you're now operating
under my supervision.

240
00:24:31,368 --> 00:24:34,702
Seems you've been left
out of the loop.

241
00:24:44,256 --> 00:24:47,340
All right, we're ready. Let's go.

242
00:24:53,264 --> 00:24:57,344
<i>- Hold it right there. Hold on.
- Not cleared for access.</i>

243
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:01,225
<i>Eye-dent: John Anderton. Approved.</i>

244
00:25:08,571 --> 00:25:10,480
- Wally.
- No, no, no, no.

245
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:13,989
Danny Witwer from Justice.
We're to give him the run of the farm.

246
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,781
- I can't touch you.
- Don't touch anything.

247
00:25:16,954 --> 00:25:20,239
- You can't be in here.
- Just answer his questions.

248
00:25:20,415 --> 00:25:22,989
- Tell me how...
- They're sleeping.

249
00:25:23,168 --> 00:25:26,122
Sorry. Tell me how all this works.

250
00:25:27,297 --> 00:25:30,168
The photon milk acts as both a
nutrient supply and conductor.

251
00:25:30,342 --> 00:25:34,635
It enhances the images they receive.
We call the female Agatha.

252
00:25:34,804 --> 00:25:39,799
The twins are Arthur and Dashiell.
We scan by way of optical tomography.

253
00:25:39,976 --> 00:25:42,846
White-light pinpoints pulse
along the length of the headgear...

254
00:25:43,021 --> 00:25:46,140
...and are reread after absorption
through their brain tissue.

255
00:25:46,941 --> 00:25:49,811
In other words, we see what they see.

256
00:25:51,237 --> 00:25:54,771
They don't feel pain. We keep
their heads stocked with dopamine.

257
00:25:54,949 --> 00:25:58,448
Plus, we maintain careful control
over their serotonin levels.

258
00:25:58,827 --> 00:26:01,614
Don't want them to drift off
into too deep a sleep.

259
00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:06,450
- They can't be kept too awake either.
- Don't think of them as human.

260
00:26:07,252 --> 00:26:10,288
No. They're much more than that.

261
00:26:12,632 --> 00:26:15,669
Science has stolen
most of our miracles.

262
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:21,509
In a way, they give us hope,
hope of the existence of the divine.

263
00:26:21,683 --> 00:26:25,514
It's interesting that some people
have begun to deify the Pre-Cogs.

264
00:26:25,686 --> 00:26:27,928
Pre-Cogs are pattern-recognition filters.
That's all.

265
00:26:28,105 --> 00:26:31,190
- Yet you call this room the "temple. "
- A nickname.

266
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:33,517
The oracle isn't where
the power is, anyway.

267
00:26:33,694 --> 00:26:38,356
The power is with the priests,
even if they had to invent the oracle.

268
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:42,868
You guys are nodding like you know
what he's talking about.

269
00:26:43,287 --> 00:26:47,498
Well, come on, chief. The way we work,
changing destiny and all...

270
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:49,742
...we're more like clergy than cops.

271
00:26:49,918 --> 00:26:51,543
- Jad.
- Yeah?

272
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,289
Go to work. All of you.

273
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:05,548
Sorry. Old habit.

274
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:09,390
I spent three years at Fuller Seminary
before I became a cop.

275
00:27:09,562 --> 00:27:12,812
- My father was proud.
- What does he think of your work?

276
00:27:12,982 --> 00:27:17,691
I don't know. He was shot and killed
when I was 15 at our church in Dublin.

277
00:27:17,862 --> 00:27:20,779
I know what it's like
to lose someone close.

278
00:27:20,948 --> 00:27:23,190
Nothing's like the loss of a child.

279
00:27:23,367 --> 00:27:27,614
I don't have any children, so I can
only imagine what that was like.

280
00:27:27,788 --> 00:27:31,453
To lose your son
in such a public place like that...

281
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:34,828
Now we can make sure that
kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone.

282
00:27:35,003 --> 00:27:38,751
- Tell me what it is you're looking for.
- Flaws.

283
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,795
There hasn't been a murder
in six years. This system is...

284
00:27:41,968 --> 00:27:46,594
Perfect. I agree.
If there's a flaw, it's human.

285
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:49,096
It always is.

286
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:51,891
John.

287
00:28:34,477 --> 00:28:35,592
Wally.

288
00:28:41,484 --> 00:28:45,481
Can you see?

289
00:29:17,518 --> 00:29:21,136
What happened? Her ACTH levels
just shot through the roof!

290
00:29:21,314 --> 00:29:23,271
- What'd you do?
- She grabbed me.

291
00:29:23,441 --> 00:29:27,272
Impossible. They're not aware of us.
In the milk, all they see is the future.

292
00:29:27,444 --> 00:29:31,489
- She looked straight at me.
- It could have been a nightmare.

293
00:29:31,657 --> 00:29:34,907
- She spoke to me.
- To you?

294
00:29:35,077 --> 00:29:36,904
What'd she say?

295
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:39,570
"Can you see?"

296
00:29:59,392 --> 00:30:00,969
You the sentry?

297
00:30:01,727 --> 00:30:04,479
Yes, sir, I'm Gideon.

298
00:30:04,647 --> 00:30:06,723
You're Chief Anderton.

299
00:30:07,483 --> 00:30:10,152
The music relaxes the prisoners.

300
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:13,818
I don't ever see you Precops down here.
Am I in trouble?

301
00:30:14,114 --> 00:30:17,199
Not yet.
I'm interested in a murder.

302
00:30:17,367 --> 00:30:20,950
- I got plenty of those. Kill type?
- Drowning.

303
00:30:21,121 --> 00:30:24,038
That narrows it down.
Not too many in here for that.

304
00:30:24,207 --> 00:30:27,659
- Victim's Caucasian, female.
- This about the Justice Department?

305
00:30:27,836 --> 00:30:32,296
I'm supposed to spruce up for a tour
they got tomorrow. You like this tie?

306
00:30:32,465 --> 00:30:33,496
Stop.

307
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,595
Roll back.

308
00:30:40,098 --> 00:30:41,378
There.

309
00:30:41,557 --> 00:30:47,393
She's a golden oldie. One of our first.
Probably before your time.

310
00:30:47,772 --> 00:30:51,852
- This is the composite of the three?
- That's right.

311
00:30:52,026 --> 00:30:55,062
Combined data stream
based on all three previsions.

312
00:30:55,237 --> 00:30:58,606
- Just show me Agatha's data stream.
- For that...

313
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:02,450
...we go for a ride.

314
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,055
My God.

315
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,509
I'd forgotten there were so many.

316
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:33,597
And to think they'd all be out there
killing people if it wasn't for you.

317
00:31:34,066 --> 00:31:36,983
Look at them.
Look at how peaceful they seem.

318
00:31:37,152 --> 00:31:41,067
But on the inside: Busy, busy, busy.

319
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,783
Okey-pokey.
Now that is one bad man.

320
00:31:45,994 --> 00:31:49,493
He drowned a woman named
Anne Lively out at Roland Lake.

321
00:31:49,664 --> 00:31:53,496
The killer's a John Doe,
never identified.

322
00:32:08,891 --> 00:32:13,103
Why is he still a John Doe?
Why wasn't he ID'd from the eye scan?

323
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:18,016
Those are not his eyes. He had them
swapped out to fool the scanners.

324
00:32:18,192 --> 00:32:22,189
You can get it done on the street
for a few thousand bucks these days.

325
00:32:22,363 --> 00:32:26,194
Okay, so you want
just the female prevision.

326
00:32:26,366 --> 00:32:27,991
That's right.

327
00:32:34,082 --> 00:32:37,368
We don't seem to have her data.

328
00:32:38,128 --> 00:32:39,836
Try again.

329
00:32:41,256 --> 00:32:44,874
This is odd. See?

330
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:49,926
We have the two previsions. We got
what Art saw. We got what Dash saw.

331
00:32:50,097 --> 00:32:53,134
But Agatha's isn't here.

332
00:32:55,478 --> 00:32:57,020
Probably just a glitch.

333
00:32:57,188 --> 00:33:01,517
Tell me about the intended victim,
this Anne Lively.

334
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:05,898
Looks like she's a neuroin addict,
like our John Doe here.

335
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:09,025
Address history
includes the Beaton Clinic.

336
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:12,402
So she cleaned up.
Where is she now?

337
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:16,914
I guess glitches come in twos.

338
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:23,333
You finally crawl your way out
of one hole just to fall into another.

339
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:29,541
No.

340
00:33:30,928 --> 00:33:33,965
Can't let you take that out of here,
chief.

341
00:33:34,765 --> 00:33:38,549
- It's against the rules.
- Anything else against the rules?

342
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:50,276
Careful, chief. You dig up the past,
all you get is dirty.

343
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:58,534
The third prevision was what,
kind of fuzzy or something?

344
00:33:58,747 --> 00:34:02,958
No, the third prevision,
Agatha's prevision, wasn't there.

345
00:34:03,168 --> 00:34:08,292
That's not all. There are a dozen more
cases with missing previsions.

346
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:11,714
You'd think we'd have found
the cure for the common cold.

347
00:34:11,926 --> 00:34:14,215
- It's stress.
- What's this?

348
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,386
Herbal tea with honey.

349
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:20,096
I hate herbal tea.
Almost as much as I hate honey.

350
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:23,144
Just drink it,
before I pour it in your lap.

351
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:26,183
- Can I get you anything, John?
- No, thank you.

352
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:30,148
Witwer's scheduled for a tour
of Containment tomorrow.

353
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,318
Yeah, give him a tour.

354
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:36,188
- Lara called me.
- What?

355
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:40,158
She's worried about you.
Quite frankly, so am I.

356
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,241
I'm fine.

357
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:46,323
I understand you've been spending
a lot of time in the Sprawl.

358
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:50,670
- I go running down there.
- In the middle of the night.

359
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,423
What if Danny Witwer
insisted on a full chem run?

360
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,294
I'm fine.

361
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:02,264
The minute Precrime goes national,
they are going to take it away.

362
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,800
- We won't let them.
- No?

363
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:09,312
How is an old man and a cop on the
whiff ever going to stop them?

364
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:12,312
My father once said to me...

365
00:35:12,526 --> 00:35:16,689
..."You don't choose the things
you believe in. They choose you. "

366
00:35:16,863 --> 00:35:18,773
There's a reason you are here.

367
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:24,744
Had Precrime been in place earlier,
your loss would have been prevented.

368
00:35:24,955 --> 00:35:26,497
Remember, the eyes...

369
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:32,249
The eyes of the nation
are on us right now.

370
00:35:32,587 --> 00:35:35,790
I'm not the generation
anyone listens to...

371
00:35:36,007 --> 00:35:40,170
...but people trust you when you
speak of your belief in Precrime.

372
00:35:40,761 --> 00:35:45,222
They know that it's a belief born of
pain, not politics. I understood that.

373
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:48,974
I may have even encouraged it
to help with the cause.

374
00:35:50,563 --> 00:35:54,560
But now,
your pain is hurting both of us.

375
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:01,239
They're not going to take it
away from us.

376
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,900
I won't let them.

377
00:36:34,563 --> 00:36:35,974
Bingo.

378
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,987
<i>- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, buddy.</i>

379
00:36:51,204 --> 00:36:53,113
<i>- I made up a club.
- Yeah?</i>

380
00:36:53,331 --> 00:36:56,949
<i>- We're called the Crescos.
- The Crescos.</i>

381
00:36:57,168 --> 00:36:59,659
<i>- We made up a soccer team.
- Yeah?</i>

382
00:36:59,879 --> 00:37:02,584
<i>- We practice at school.
- With Connor?</i>

383
00:37:02,799 --> 00:37:05,835
Your daddy's in a lot of trouble,
Sean.

384
00:37:30,867 --> 00:37:33,323
- Wait!
- No!

385
00:37:35,997 --> 00:37:38,702
Jad, how come you're not with
Father Witwer?

386
00:37:38,917 --> 00:37:44,670
We're in motion on something. We got a
white, male victim, about 5' 10", 170.

387
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:47,412
He takes a round in the 10-ring
and goes out a window.

388
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:49,425
- Red Ball?
- Nope. Brown Ball.

389
00:37:49,635 --> 00:37:50,833
It's premeditated.

390
00:37:51,053 --> 00:37:54,671
Amazing. There's someone within
200 miles still dumb enough to do that.

391
00:37:54,849 --> 00:37:56,391
The victim's name is Leo Crow.

392
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:01,143
This is case number 1109. Time of
occurrence: Friday, 1506 hours.

393
00:38:01,355 --> 00:38:05,815
Start search for Leo Crow. Case 1109,
previsualized by the Pre-Cogs...

394
00:38:06,026 --> 00:38:09,311
...recorded on holosphere
by Precrime's Q-stacks.

395
00:38:09,529 --> 00:38:13,990
My fellow witnesses are Dr. Katherine
James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.

396
00:38:14,201 --> 00:38:15,445
Good morning.

397
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,330
Are you ready
to preview and validate 1109?

398
00:38:18,538 --> 00:38:21,455
<i>- Ready when you are, John.
- Standing by.</i>

399
00:38:27,213 --> 00:38:29,004
I love this part.

400
00:38:30,049 --> 00:38:35,043
I've got no address. No tax returns
for the last five years.

401
00:38:35,221 --> 00:38:37,794
Check NCIC.
Maybe he's got a number.

402
00:38:38,641 --> 00:38:42,389
We'll send a protection team
as soon as we lock location.

403
00:38:45,522 --> 00:38:48,227
It looks like federal housing.
Concrete, glass, egg crates.

404
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,484
Ouch. About a thousand of those
in the District.

405
00:38:52,988 --> 00:38:54,779
Fractured images coming in.

406
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,362
Numbers nine...

407
00:38:59,911 --> 00:39:01,619
Nine, six.

408
00:39:06,209 --> 00:39:10,206
Female, senior. She's smoking a pipe.

409
00:39:11,047 --> 00:39:12,327
She's laughing.

410
00:39:15,927 --> 00:39:18,049
Okay, now I'm inside a room.

411
00:39:18,971 --> 00:39:21,723
Windowpanes, aluminum extrusion.

412
00:39:22,266 --> 00:39:25,433
Two figures resolving in the room.

413
00:39:26,478 --> 00:39:28,601
<i>- Wait!
- No...</i>

414
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,357
Looks like we got a third party.

415
00:39:35,237 --> 00:39:37,906
Wearing sunglasses,
just out the window.

416
00:39:38,615 --> 00:39:40,572
You're not gonna kill me.

417
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,779
Goodbye, Crow.

418
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,584
<i>You're not gonna kill me.</i>

419
00:39:52,962 --> 00:39:54,955
<i>- Goodbye, Crow.
- Wait!</i>

420
00:39:58,843 --> 00:40:00,966
Wait. Wait.

421
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,379
You say something, chief?

422
00:40:03,597 --> 00:40:04,795
No.

423
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,970
I'll get this one.

424
00:40:10,437 --> 00:40:12,477
We got time on this one, Jad.

425
00:40:12,648 --> 00:40:15,602
Mind getting me a piece
of cake they're eating?

426
00:40:15,817 --> 00:40:17,644
- I'm starving.
- Sure, chief.

427
00:40:17,819 --> 00:40:20,654
I think I'll get one for myself too.

428
00:40:20,822 --> 00:40:22,316
Take your time.

429
00:40:39,006 --> 00:40:42,671
<i>Chief Anderton,
what is this that I'm seeing?</i>

430
00:40:43,386 --> 00:40:44,880
<i>I'm confused about...</i>

431
00:41:16,793 --> 00:41:18,832
<i>- Anderton, wait!
- Goodbye, Crow.</i>

432
00:41:19,045 --> 00:41:20,373
<i>Anderton, wait!</i>

433
00:41:22,256 --> 00:41:24,165
<i>Anderton, wait!</i>

434
00:41:30,347 --> 00:41:34,131
I like you, chief.
You've always been nice to me.

435
00:41:36,395 --> 00:41:39,396
Give you two minutes
before I hit the alarm.

436
00:41:55,788 --> 00:41:57,199
Hold that, please.

437
00:41:58,499 --> 00:41:59,744
Thanks.

438
00:42:03,045 --> 00:42:06,710
- You're in a lot of trouble, John.
- You set me up.

439
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:09,842
I'll write the paranoia off to the
whiff you've been doping on.

440
00:42:10,052 --> 00:42:11,297
Easy.

441
00:42:11,512 --> 00:42:13,754
- Easy.
- Seems I've found a flaw.

442
00:42:16,266 --> 00:42:17,464
What are you gonna do?

443
00:42:17,684 --> 00:42:20,602
Possession will cost you six months
and your badge.

444
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:23,262
I guess we won't be working together
after all.

445
00:42:23,482 --> 00:42:27,100
Now put the gun down, John.
I don't hear a Red Ball.

446
00:42:48,547 --> 00:42:50,623
<i>Lamar. Lamar.</i>

447
00:42:53,219 --> 00:42:55,591
<i>- Lamar?
- John, what is happening?</i>

448
00:42:55,804 --> 00:42:57,797
It's Witwer. He set me up!

449
00:42:57,973 --> 00:42:59,302
Stop, just wait.

450
00:42:59,475 --> 00:43:02,428
- Witwer! It's Witwer.
- Who's the victim?

451
00:43:02,644 --> 00:43:04,269
<i>- Somebody.
- Who?</i>

452
00:43:04,479 --> 00:43:06,472
<i>- Somebody... Leo Crow.
- Who is he?</i>

453
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:09,441
I have no idea!
I've never heard of him.

454
00:43:09,651 --> 00:43:12,652
But I'm supposed to kill him
in less than 36 hours.

455
00:43:12,821 --> 00:43:16,106
- How could Witwer have access?
- Can you fake a cerebral output?

456
00:43:16,324 --> 00:43:17,949
<i>- Why would anyone want to?
- Can you?</i>

457
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:20,484
- I doubt it.
- Would Hineman know?

458
00:43:20,662 --> 00:43:22,738
<i>- Now listen, come in.
- What?</i>

459
00:43:22,956 --> 00:43:25,363
I'll protect you until we
get to the bottom of this.

460
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:28,619
Talk to Wally. See if Witwer's gone
inside the temple again.

461
00:43:28,836 --> 00:43:32,287
Ask Jad for any off-hour
eye-dents into the analytical room.

462
00:43:33,049 --> 00:43:34,840
Who's Leo Crow?

463
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:37,838
<i>Security lockdown enabled.
Revised destination: Office.</i>

464
00:43:38,012 --> 00:43:40,716
Lamar, they found me.

465
00:43:45,143 --> 00:43:48,347
Is there any way to override
the lockdown?

466
00:43:48,563 --> 00:43:50,473
<i>- No, no, no.
- No?</i>

467
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:54,190
<i>I'll meet you anywhere you say.
You can come to my house, John.</i>

468
00:43:54,402 --> 00:43:56,976
I can't. They'll get me.
I'm not gonna get haloed.

469
00:43:57,197 --> 00:43:58,311
You can't run.

470
00:43:59,282 --> 00:44:00,527
Everybody runs.

471
00:44:47,578 --> 00:44:49,488
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, hey.

472
00:45:04,094 --> 00:45:06,764
Oh, my gosh, are you okay?

473
00:45:10,017 --> 00:45:12,223
I'll bring him in. Unharmed.

474
00:45:12,436 --> 00:45:15,105
You're not gonna do that.
I'm taking control.

475
00:45:15,272 --> 00:45:16,517
What?

476
00:45:16,731 --> 00:45:21,144
Fletcher is second in command.
It's his show to run. You can observe.

477
00:45:21,361 --> 00:45:24,730
- Do it. Find him.
- Yes, sir.

478
00:45:26,741 --> 00:45:30,359
He came to see you the other day
right before he was tagged.

479
00:45:30,578 --> 00:45:33,151
- What did you talk about?
- The Mets.

480
00:45:33,372 --> 00:45:36,207
John doesn't think they have a deep
enough pitching roster.

481
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:40,284
Why are you protecting him? You knew
he was doping, yet you did nothing.

482
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:43,838
- The man lost a child, for chrissake.
- Six years ago.

483
00:45:44,049 --> 00:45:47,086
- What did you talk about?
- None of your business.

484
00:45:47,303 --> 00:45:51,799
It's my business. Investigation of a
supervising officer for a capital crime...

485
00:45:51,974 --> 00:45:56,102
...falls under federal jurisdiction
so as to rule out any conspiracy.

486
00:45:56,311 --> 00:45:58,719
- He's my suspect.
- He's my subordinate.

487
00:45:58,939 --> 00:46:02,557
Call the attorney general. I'm sure
he'd clarify the issue for you.

488
00:46:02,776 --> 00:46:06,109
I don't want John Anderton hurt.

489
00:46:07,989 --> 00:46:10,361
I'm going to enjoy working here.

490
00:46:13,244 --> 00:46:15,486
<i>A road diverges in the desert.</i>

491
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,409
<i>Lexus.</i>

492
00:46:17,623 --> 00:46:21,491
<i>The road you're on, John Anderton,
is the one less-traveled.</i>

493
00:46:21,711 --> 00:46:24,830
<i>- Make sure you...
- Diamonds...</i>

494
00:46:27,007 --> 00:46:29,130
<i>Good evening, John Anderton.</i>

495
00:46:32,346 --> 00:46:36,260
<i>John Anderton! You could use
a Guinness right about now.</i>

496
00:46:38,769 --> 00:46:41,520
<i>- John Anderton...
- Escape from it all.</i>

497
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:46,392
<i>Get away, John Anderton.
Forget your troubles.</i>

498
00:47:03,376 --> 00:47:07,836
He's been eye-dented on the Metro.
The train stops at 20th and 33rd.

499
00:47:08,047 --> 00:47:09,838
Send units to each location.

500
00:47:10,049 --> 00:47:11,840
- Better make 20th.
- Have faith.

501
00:47:52,882 --> 00:47:54,292
Fire them up!

502
00:48:18,448 --> 00:48:20,440
- Hey, Fletch.
- Hey, John.

503
00:48:20,616 --> 00:48:22,775
- That was a rough landing.
- Yeah.

504
00:48:22,952 --> 00:48:25,408
- Work on that.
- It's the shit knee of mine.

505
00:48:25,621 --> 00:48:27,530
- Yeah.
- Don't do it.

506
00:48:28,291 --> 00:48:30,117
Hey, don't do this.

507
00:48:30,876 --> 00:48:32,121
John?

508
00:48:32,461 --> 00:48:33,790
Don't run.

509
00:48:34,296 --> 00:48:36,336
You don't have to chase me.

510
00:48:36,924 --> 00:48:38,584
You don't have to run.

511
00:48:38,926 --> 00:48:40,799
Everybody runs, Fletch.

512
00:48:41,011 --> 00:48:43,004
You know we'll catch you.

513
00:48:44,014 --> 00:48:45,722
Everybody runs.

514
00:48:47,684 --> 00:48:51,812
- It doesn't have to be like this, John.
- Everybody runs.

515
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:54,103
Get your sick-sticks ready.

516
00:48:55,483 --> 00:48:57,227
Everybody runs, Fletch.

517
00:48:57,777 --> 00:49:00,350
Slow down, chief. Just take it easy.

518
00:49:04,367 --> 00:49:06,276
No sudden moves, chief.

519
00:49:07,495 --> 00:49:09,487
John, it's okay.

520
00:49:09,956 --> 00:49:12,162
- Fletch...
- Easy does it, chief.

521
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:42,022
Got a grip?

522
00:49:42,195 --> 00:49:43,938
- Got a grip?
- Yeah.

523
00:50:12,724 --> 00:50:14,135
Anderton!

524
00:50:45,297 --> 00:50:48,002
Go away! Get out of my kitchen!

525
00:50:48,217 --> 00:50:51,253
Get out of my house!
Get out of my house! Go!

526
00:50:54,264 --> 00:50:56,755
- Get them out of here!
- Anderton, stop!

527
00:50:56,933 --> 00:50:59,638
Pull him off me, Fletcher.
Get him off me.

528
00:51:01,354 --> 00:51:04,557
Get him out of here!
What's the matter with you?!

529
00:51:09,654 --> 00:51:11,860
Get out of my house! Go!

530
00:51:32,426 --> 00:51:36,719
By mandate of the District of Columbia,
I'm placing you under arrest for...

531
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:38,258
Go to sleep.

532
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,702
You two stay with me!

533
00:56:31,546 --> 00:56:32,957
Dr. Hineman.

534
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:36,793
You're trespassing.
I don't have visitors.

535
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:45,099
That would be from the doll's eye,
the vine...

536
00:56:45,268 --> 00:56:48,601
...the baneberry that scratched you
during your illegal climb over my wall.

537
00:56:48,771 --> 00:56:52,603
It's not a true doll's eye.
It's a little hybrid I designed.

538
00:56:52,817 --> 00:56:56,565
Once the poison gets into your
bloodstream, you'll start to see...

539
00:56:56,779 --> 00:57:00,942
...the most extraordinary display
of blue objects.

540
00:57:01,117 --> 00:57:04,616
This just isn't your week, is it?

541
00:57:06,121 --> 00:57:07,616
Chief Anderton.

542
00:57:10,042 --> 00:57:11,619
I'm not a killer.

543
00:57:17,674 --> 00:57:19,133
You better drink this.

544
00:57:19,342 --> 00:57:23,387
Soon you won't be able to swallow,
and then you'll be totally buggered.

545
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:25,884
All of it.

546
00:57:26,641 --> 00:57:30,057
Okay, now take a minute
to right yourself.

547
00:57:31,437 --> 00:57:35,020
Just what is it you think
I can do for you?

548
00:57:37,485 --> 00:57:41,897
You could tell me how someone
can fake a prevision.

549
00:57:42,114 --> 00:57:44,071
How would I know that?

550
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:46,941
Because you invented Precrime.

551
00:57:48,996 --> 00:57:50,573
What's so funny?

552
00:57:51,081 --> 00:57:56,158
If the consequences of several genetic
mistakes and science gone haywire...

553
00:57:56,336 --> 00:57:59,207
...can be called an invention,
then I invented Precrime.

554
00:57:59,423 --> 00:58:01,415
- You don't seem proud.
- I'm not.

555
00:58:01,633 --> 00:58:04,800
I was trying to heal them,
not turn them into something else.

556
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:07,757
- Heal who?
- The innocents we use to stop the guilty.

557
00:58:07,972 --> 00:58:11,176
You're talking about the Pre-Cogs.

558
00:58:11,392 --> 00:58:16,553
You think they came from a test tube?
They are merely the ones who survived.

559
00:58:16,773 --> 00:58:20,556
I was doing genetic research,
treating children of drug addicts.

560
00:58:20,776 --> 00:58:24,394
This was 10 years ago,
when neuroin first hit the streets.

561
00:58:24,613 --> 00:58:30,782
It was impure, not the engineered
cocktail popular among the educated.

562
00:58:31,704 --> 00:58:37,457
All of these kids were born with severe
brain damage. Most died before age 12.

563
00:58:37,668 --> 00:58:40,372
Those few who survived,
they had a gift.

564
00:58:40,545 --> 00:58:43,879
I call it a gift. For them,
it was more like a cosmic joke.

565
00:58:44,090 --> 00:58:46,842
They would wake up in the night,
curled in the corner...

566
00:58:47,052 --> 00:58:48,961
...screaming, clawing at the walls.

567
00:58:49,179 --> 00:58:53,508
Because when these children
closed their eyes at night...

568
00:58:53,683 --> 00:58:58,144
...they dreamt only of murder
over and over, one after the other.

569
00:58:58,312 --> 00:59:01,895
It didn't take for us long to realize
that the real nightmare was...

570
00:59:02,108 --> 00:59:07,066
...that these dreams were about to come
true, these murders were happening.

571
00:59:10,991 --> 00:59:13,399
You say some of the children died?

572
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:16,822
So many of them.
Despite what we did for them.

573
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:21,286
Or maybe because of what we
did to them. But it doesn't matter.

574
00:59:21,501 --> 00:59:24,288
It's a perfect system now, isn't it?

575
00:59:25,422 --> 00:59:27,545
I'm not going to commit murder.

576
00:59:27,757 --> 00:59:30,130
I've never met the man
I'm supposed to kill.

577
00:59:30,343 --> 00:59:34,590
And yet a chain of events has started
that will lead you to his murder.

578
00:59:34,806 --> 00:59:37,593
- Not if I stay away from him.
- Can you avoid a man you've never met?

579
00:59:37,809 --> 00:59:40,763
- You won't help?
- I can't help you. Nobody can.

580
00:59:40,978 --> 00:59:43,766
The Pre-Cogs are never wrong.

581
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:48,273
But occasionally...

582
00:59:48,819 --> 00:59:50,942
...they do disagree.

583
00:59:52,448 --> 00:59:53,610
What?

584
00:59:53,908 --> 00:59:58,616
Most of the time, all three Pre-Cogs
will see an event in the same way...

585
00:59:58,787 --> 01:00:02,737
...but once in a while, one of them will
see things differently than the others.

586
01:00:02,916 --> 01:00:06,961
Jesus Christ.
Why didn't I know about this?

587
01:00:07,712 --> 01:00:10,916
Because these Minority Reports
are destroyed the instant they occur.

588
01:00:11,091 --> 01:00:12,253
Why?

589
01:00:12,425 --> 01:00:17,383
For Precrime to function, there can't
be any suggestion of fallibility.

590
01:00:17,555 --> 01:00:20,675
Who wants a justice system
that instills doubt?

591
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:23,767
It may be reasonable,
but it's still doubt.

592
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:28,023
Are you saying
I've haloed innocent people?

593
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:31,939
I'm saying that every so often,
those accused of a Precrime...

594
01:00:32,111 --> 01:00:34,684
...just might have
an alternate future.

595
01:00:34,864 --> 01:00:38,778
Does Burgess know about this,
about this Minority Report?

596
01:00:38,993 --> 01:00:42,527
I used to joke with Lamar that
we were the parents of Precrime.

597
01:00:42,704 --> 01:00:47,615
Parents often see their children as they
want them to be and not as they are.

598
01:00:47,793 --> 01:00:52,953
Answer my question: Does Lamar
Burgess know about the Minority Report?

599
01:00:53,131 --> 01:00:54,791
Yes, of course, he knew.

600
01:00:54,966 --> 01:01:00,209
But at the time, we felt their existence
was an insignificant variable.

601
01:01:00,388 --> 01:01:02,345
Insignificant to you, maybe.

602
01:01:02,515 --> 01:01:06,299
But what about those people that
I put away with alternate futures?

603
01:01:06,519 --> 01:01:10,184
- My God, if the country knew...
- The system would collapse.

604
01:01:12,233 --> 01:01:14,854
- I believe in that system.
- Do you really?

605
01:01:15,027 --> 01:01:16,652
You wanna bring it down.

606
01:01:16,821 --> 01:01:20,735
You will bring it down
if you manage to kill your victim.

607
01:01:20,908 --> 01:01:25,985
That'll be the most spectacular public
display of how Precrime didn't work.

608
01:01:26,163 --> 01:01:29,117
- I'm not gonna kill anybody.
- Hold that thought.

609
01:01:29,291 --> 01:01:32,742
- Why should I trust you?
- You shouldn't trust anyone.

610
01:01:32,919 --> 01:01:36,169
Certainly not the attorney general,
who wants it all for himself.

611
01:01:36,339 --> 01:01:39,091
And not the young federal agent,
who wants your job.

612
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:43,512
Not even the old man who just wants
to hang on to what he created.

613
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:47,095
Don't trust anyone.
Just find the Minority Report.

614
01:01:49,018 --> 01:01:50,761
You said the Minority Report
is destroyed.

615
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:54,721
The record is destroyed.
The original report still exists.

616
01:01:54,899 --> 01:02:00,141
I designed it so the report is stored
in a safe place, but not declared.

617
01:02:00,321 --> 01:02:02,609
What safe place is that?

618
01:02:02,781 --> 01:02:06,031
The safest place there is.

619
01:02:06,243 --> 01:02:09,197
Where is it?

620
01:02:11,331 --> 01:02:15,329
Inside the Pre-Cog who predicted it.

621
01:02:19,923 --> 01:02:24,466
All you have to do
is download it, darling.

622
01:02:26,054 --> 01:02:27,714
That's all, huh?

623
01:02:31,142 --> 01:02:33,977
Just walk into Precrime,
get into the temple...

624
01:02:34,145 --> 01:02:38,807
...somehow tap into these Pre-Cogs
and download this Minority Report.

625
01:02:38,983 --> 01:02:41,474
- If you have one.
- And then walk out.

626
01:02:41,652 --> 01:02:46,148
Actually, you'll have to run out.
But yes, that's what you have to do.

627
01:02:47,032 --> 01:02:49,072
You're insane.

628
01:02:49,701 --> 01:02:51,824
Or you think I am.

629
01:02:51,995 --> 01:02:57,202
I'll get eye-scanned a dozen times
before I get within 10 miles of Precrime.

630
01:02:57,375 --> 01:03:02,203
Sometimes in order to see the light,
you have to risk the dark.

631
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:05,714
As a policeman...
Excuse me, as a former policeman...

632
01:03:05,884 --> 01:03:08,588
...I'm sure that you know
all sorts of people...

633
01:03:08,803 --> 01:03:12,089
...who can help you out
in this regard.

634
01:03:18,229 --> 01:03:21,265
It's funny how all
living organisms are alike.

635
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:25,141
When the chips are down,
when the pressure is on...

636
01:03:25,319 --> 01:03:28,273
...every creature
on the face of the earth...

637
01:03:28,447 --> 01:03:31,898
...is interested in one thing
and one thing only:

638
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:35,116
Its own survival.

639
01:03:36,747 --> 01:03:38,905
Find the Minority Report.

640
01:03:44,004 --> 01:03:46,755
How do I even know which one has it?

641
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:50,257
It's always in the more gifted
of the three.

642
01:03:51,844 --> 01:03:53,754
Which one is that?

643
01:03:56,724 --> 01:03:58,598
The female.

644
01:04:01,687 --> 01:04:05,388
We've got three men in a room.
The victim is here...

645
01:04:05,566 --> 01:04:09,777
...John is here, and this
unidentified male, at the window.

646
01:04:09,945 --> 01:04:13,777
The adjacent building suggests
public housing, which means...

647
01:04:13,949 --> 01:04:16,784
- There's thousands like this one.
- They're everywhere.

648
01:04:16,952 --> 01:04:19,869
But he doesn't go there to kill Crow
for another 22 hours.

649
01:04:20,038 --> 01:04:22,245
This is Chief Anderton's space.

650
01:04:22,416 --> 01:04:24,325
- He's not here.
- He'll be back.

651
01:04:24,501 --> 01:04:28,249
I doubt that. I'm betting
he's somewhere in the Sprawl.

652
01:04:28,421 --> 01:04:32,253
He's smart enough to go
where billboards can't ID him.

653
01:04:32,425 --> 01:04:34,797
There's fewer consumers,
which means fewer scanners.

654
01:04:34,969 --> 01:04:39,216
- Why won't he just run?
- Because he thinks he's innocent.

655
01:04:40,475 --> 01:04:42,301
We concentrate on the Sprawl.

656
01:04:42,476 --> 01:04:45,513
We do fly-overs in ships,
with two spyder teams on the ground.

657
01:04:45,688 --> 01:04:50,017
Thermal scan the entire area. Read
anything with eyes and a heartbeat.

658
01:05:05,874 --> 01:05:07,154
Where is she?

659
01:05:25,685 --> 01:05:31,687
<i>Started blowing buttons for no reason
whatsoever, and I knew that.</i>

660
01:05:35,277 --> 01:05:37,353
This damn cold.

661
01:05:38,530 --> 01:05:42,777
Don't worry. I could cut open your
chest and sew a dead cat in there...

662
01:05:42,951 --> 01:05:47,613
...you wouldn't get an infection. Not
with the antibios I'll shoot into you.

663
01:05:47,789 --> 01:05:49,283
That's comforting.

664
01:05:49,457 --> 01:05:52,873
You do understand I can't just
give you new irises?

665
01:05:53,044 --> 01:05:54,503
Please, don't touch.

666
01:05:54,671 --> 01:05:58,620
Because the scanners would read the
new scar tissue, alarms will go off...

667
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:01,373
...and large men with guns will appear.

668
01:06:03,846 --> 01:06:05,590
What was that?

669
01:06:05,765 --> 01:06:06,927
What was that?

670
01:06:07,099 --> 01:06:11,726
- It's anesthesia. It's all downhill...
- You always sneak up on your patients?

671
01:06:11,896 --> 01:06:16,024
You wouldn't break the hand
of a violinist before the concert.

672
01:06:16,192 --> 01:06:17,816
Please, relax.

673
01:06:22,364 --> 01:06:27,655
All I'm trying to tell you is that I'll
have to remove your eyes completely.

674
01:06:27,828 --> 01:06:28,990
I know.

675
01:06:29,913 --> 01:06:34,124
- I have to replace them with new ones.
- I know. But I wanna keep the old ones.

676
01:06:34,292 --> 01:06:37,957
- Why?
- Because my mother gave them to me.

677
01:06:38,129 --> 01:06:40,501
What's it to you?
You can't resell them.

678
01:06:40,673 --> 01:06:43,591
Whatever you say. It's your money.

679
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:55,512
Let me introduce my gorgeous
assistant, Miss Van Eyck.

680
01:07:16,291 --> 01:07:20,703
- This is not a lot of money.
- It's all that I could safely move.

681
01:07:23,631 --> 01:07:25,256
Okay.

682
01:07:29,053 --> 01:07:32,422
- What did you give me?
- Smile medicine.

683
01:07:32,598 --> 01:07:35,089
Tell you what, since we go way back...

684
01:07:35,267 --> 01:07:39,561
...why don't I give you my old pal
discount? What do you say?

685
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:41,972
You don't remember me, do you?

686
01:07:42,149 --> 01:07:45,648
- We know each other?
- Yes, we do.

687
01:07:45,903 --> 01:07:47,860
From where? D.C.?

688
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:52,608
- Baltimore. The East Side.
- Baltimore? We go way back.

689
01:07:52,784 --> 01:07:56,829
Solomon P. Eddie, M.D.
I was a plastic surgeon.

690
01:07:56,997 --> 01:08:02,239
You remember? Specialized
in burn victims, mostly women.

691
01:08:02,419 --> 01:08:06,084
- I put you away.
- Yeah, you did.

692
01:08:07,882 --> 01:08:10,124
You made those tapes.

693
01:08:10,301 --> 01:08:12,874
They were performance pieces.

694
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:18,343
- You set your patients on fire.
- I put them out.

695
01:08:18,517 --> 01:08:23,891
Some not as quickly as others, but
let's change the subject, shall we?

696
01:08:25,649 --> 01:08:31,319
The future's so much more interesting
than the past, don't you think?

697
01:08:34,032 --> 01:08:38,077
Miss Van Eyck.
I'm afraid she's already smitten.

698
01:08:38,662 --> 01:08:42,991
She only has eyes for you.

699
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,832
I know what you're thinking, John:
How can I do what I do now?

700
01:08:48,004 --> 01:08:52,713
Let's say that I spent an awful lot
of time in the prison library.

701
01:08:52,884 --> 01:08:58,091
That was a great way to avoid the more
unpleasant aspects of prison life.

702
01:08:58,264 --> 01:09:01,633
Confinement was
a real education, a real...

703
01:09:03,769 --> 01:09:05,263
...eye-opener.

704
01:09:09,733 --> 01:09:12,900
For true enlightenment,
there's nothing quite like...

705
01:09:13,070 --> 01:09:16,439
...well, let's say, taking a shower
while this large fellow...

706
01:09:16,657 --> 01:09:20,156
...with an attitude you can't
knock down with a hammer...

707
01:09:20,327 --> 01:09:22,485
...whispers in your ear, "Oh, Nancy. "

708
01:09:22,662 --> 01:09:26,327
That was a lot of fun.
Thank you for putting me there...

709
01:09:26,499 --> 01:09:30,746
...and giving me the opportunity to
get to know myself so much better.

710
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,376
And now to return the favor.

711
01:09:44,767 --> 01:09:47,851
- This your work?
- Yes.

712
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:50,098
I like it.

713
01:09:50,272 --> 01:09:53,356
- How do you take your coffee?
- Cream and sugar.

714
01:09:53,525 --> 01:09:56,063
- I don't have any cream. Sorry.
- Just sugar then.

715
01:09:56,236 --> 01:09:58,608
- You and John ever come here?
- We used to.

716
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:00,607
He's not here now, is he?

717
01:10:02,784 --> 01:10:04,611
I had to ask.

718
01:10:07,038 --> 01:10:09,992
- I don't have any sugar either.
- Thank you.

719
01:10:10,166 --> 01:10:13,120
- He hasn't tried to contact you?
- No.

720
01:10:13,294 --> 01:10:15,916
Did he ever mention the name
Leo Crow?

721
01:10:16,089 --> 01:10:18,959
No, but I don't talk
to John much anymore.

722
01:10:19,133 --> 01:10:22,716
- So you haven't seen his apartment.
- That was our apartment.

723
01:10:22,887 --> 01:10:25,841
Have you been there recently?
It's full of these.

724
01:10:26,015 --> 01:10:30,641
- How long has he been doping?
- Since right after we lost our son.

725
01:10:30,811 --> 01:10:36,267
- You mean after he lost your son.
- It was nobody's fault.

726
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:42,023
But John was with him
at the public pool.

727
01:10:42,406 --> 01:10:44,979
You said in your divorce papers
that John tried to kill himself.

728
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:48,492
- It wasn't a suicide attempt.
- What was it then?

729
01:10:48,662 --> 01:10:52,742
The FBI found something
that belonged to my son, a sandal.

730
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:54,493
John was upset. He...

731
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:57,663
He took out his gun
and watched home movies.

732
01:10:57,837 --> 01:11:02,131
- This is all in your statement.
- He shot a hole in the ceiling. So what?

733
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:05,965
You lose your son,
let's see how well you handle it.

734
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:11,464
Lamar thinks you left John because he
lost himself in Precrime instead of you.

735
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:16,684
I left him because every time
I looked at him, I saw my son.

736
01:11:17,564 --> 01:11:22,025
Every time I got close to him,
I smelled my little boy.

737
01:11:22,194 --> 01:11:24,815
That's why I left him.

738
01:11:25,822 --> 01:11:28,029
And now you can leave.

739
01:11:29,993 --> 01:11:33,160
Don't take the bandages off
for 12 hours.

740
01:11:37,959 --> 01:11:42,253
If you take them off before then,
you'll go blind. Understand?

741
01:11:43,381 --> 01:11:47,378
In the fridge, there's milk.
Greta made you a sandwich.

742
01:11:47,552 --> 01:11:50,387
Make sure you drink a lot of water.

743
01:11:50,554 --> 01:11:52,547
How do I find the bathroom?

744
01:11:53,057 --> 01:11:56,591
The bathroom?
Now that's your right hand.

745
01:11:59,146 --> 01:12:01,767
The kitchen is your left.

746
01:12:03,984 --> 01:12:06,819
Don't scratch. Never scratch!

747
01:12:07,237 --> 01:12:11,899
Seeing as we're being pals, I'll give
you a bonus that may come in handy.

748
01:12:12,075 --> 01:12:16,452
This is a temporary paralytic enzyme.
You're gonna shoot this under your chin.

749
01:12:16,788 --> 01:12:20,157
- What is this?
- It'll turn your pretty face into mush.

750
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:22,741
People won't even recognize you.

751
01:12:22,919 --> 01:12:27,248
In 30 minutes, it'll tighten up again.
But it'll hurt like you've never felt.

752
01:12:27,423 --> 01:12:31,421
I'm gonna put this in your goody-bag,
together with your...

753
01:12:31,636 --> 01:12:33,462
...leftovers.

754
01:12:35,139 --> 01:12:40,809
I'm setting up a timer. When it rings,
you can remove the bandages and leave.

755
01:12:40,978 --> 01:12:44,927
- But not before then, or you will...
- Go blind. I know.

756
01:12:45,107 --> 01:12:47,016
Don't scratch.

757
01:12:47,985 --> 01:12:52,730
A little something from
a mutual friend of ours.

758
01:13:29,441 --> 01:13:32,014
<i>Don't take the bandages off
for 12 hours.</i>

759
01:13:32,986 --> 01:13:37,731
<i>If you take them off before then,
you'll go blind. Understand?</i>

760
01:13:58,427 --> 01:14:03,219
- 25. 16 seconds. That's a new record.
- Is that a world record?

761
01:14:03,390 --> 01:14:06,890
Is it a world record?
It's a personal best.

762
01:14:07,061 --> 01:14:10,097
- Now I wanna time you.
- You gotta be kidding.

763
01:14:10,272 --> 01:14:13,226
There's no way
I can beat 25. 16 seconds.

764
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:16,235
How long can a whale hold its breath?

765
01:14:16,403 --> 01:14:18,561
For about 20 minutes.

766
01:14:18,738 --> 01:14:22,072
- So we gotta beat the whale.
- Okay.

767
01:14:23,785 --> 01:14:26,192
We gotta beat the whale.

768
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:28,158
Here you go.

769
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:32,198
It's gonna be 20 minutes. You sure
you don't wanna go for an ice cream?

770
01:14:32,377 --> 01:14:35,377
Because you know
I'm gonna beat that whale.

771
01:14:35,796 --> 01:14:37,421
- Ready?
- Give me the count.

772
01:14:37,590 --> 01:14:39,832
Three, two, one, go!

773
01:14:57,567 --> 01:14:59,062
Sean?

774
01:15:01,863 --> 01:15:03,061
Sean?

775
01:15:06,034 --> 01:15:07,362
Sean.

776
01:15:13,875 --> 01:15:15,618
Have you seen...?

777
01:15:17,170 --> 01:15:21,666
I'm looking for my son. Have you
seen a boy in a red bathing suit?

778
01:15:23,342 --> 01:15:26,841
You seen my boy?
He's wearing a red bathing suit.

779
01:17:14,908 --> 01:17:19,819
Jad, we're ready to begin thermal scan
on all residences on North Powell.

780
01:17:20,872 --> 01:17:23,363
You must really like me, don't you?

781
01:17:23,541 --> 01:17:26,411
That's why you asked to partner
with me on this sortie.

782
01:17:26,586 --> 01:17:28,044
You're swell company.

783
01:17:28,212 --> 01:17:31,498
It's not that you don't trust me
to be alone with the chief, is it?

784
01:17:31,674 --> 01:17:33,916
That you think I might, you know,
futz with him?

785
01:17:34,093 --> 01:17:37,960
No, I just wanna watch him use your
body to sandblast another building.

786
01:17:38,138 --> 01:17:39,170
Evanna, go.

787
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:43,056
I show 27 warm bodies.

788
01:17:43,227 --> 01:17:46,062
Roger that. Confirmed, 27 warm bodies.

789
01:17:46,229 --> 01:17:51,187
- Four spyders, one per floor?
- Let's do eight. I gotta eat.

790
01:18:06,582 --> 01:18:11,789
Residents of 931 Powell, this is
Officer Fletcher of D.C. Precrime.

791
01:18:11,963 --> 01:18:17,253
Under authority of P.C. section 6409, we
are deploying spyders into your complex.

792
01:18:18,469 --> 01:18:20,841
Mom, I'm scared.

793
01:18:21,055 --> 01:18:23,546
Mommy, I'm scared. Mommy.

794
01:18:23,724 --> 01:18:27,673
That's gonna scan you.
Keep your eyes open. Stay still.

795
01:18:27,853 --> 01:18:29,680
- It's okay.
- I don't like it.

796
01:18:29,855 --> 01:18:31,931
Stay still. Stay still.

797
01:18:55,463 --> 01:18:56,625
Come on!

798
01:18:56,797 --> 01:18:59,371
You stepped out on me
for the last time.

799
01:18:59,550 --> 01:19:01,127
I told you where I was.

800
01:19:01,302 --> 01:19:04,219
You're a no-good liar.
I know you was with that ho.

801
01:19:04,388 --> 01:19:06,012
You're lucky we...

802
01:19:10,227 --> 01:19:12,303
Leave me alone!

803
01:20:28,635 --> 01:20:30,178
We lost one.

804
01:20:30,512 --> 01:20:34,462
Roger that. Maybe it was
a cat jumping through a window.

805
01:20:34,891 --> 01:20:36,551
It's an awful big cat.

806
01:20:36,727 --> 01:20:38,102
Fletcher.

807
01:20:39,104 --> 01:20:41,061
I'll go check it out.

808
01:21:19,518 --> 01:21:22,887
They're crying their eyes out.
You terrified them.

809
01:21:23,063 --> 01:21:25,269
Keep your kids away from me.

810
01:21:40,621 --> 01:21:44,998
The big cat's back. What do you think?
A drunk, maybe can't wake up?

811
01:21:45,167 --> 01:21:47,789
Or a guy who doesn't want to get read.

812
01:21:47,962 --> 01:21:50,535
Folks, be quiet, go back inside.

813
01:22:01,433 --> 01:22:03,639
Be quiet and close the door.

814
01:22:10,692 --> 01:22:12,981
We got an ID. It's not him.

815
01:22:14,904 --> 01:22:17,775
- Standing down.
- Let's eat.

816
01:22:31,170 --> 01:22:33,957
Fletcher, take a look.

817
01:22:35,632 --> 01:22:38,836
There's four people in this room,
not three.

818
01:22:39,011 --> 01:22:42,510
Four? There's Anderton, Crow
and the man in sunglasses.

819
01:22:42,681 --> 01:22:45,966
The man in the sunglasses
is outside the window.

820
01:22:48,436 --> 01:22:53,098
There's also someone here
in the mirror.

821
01:22:53,775 --> 01:22:55,898
Definitely female.

822
01:22:56,361 --> 01:23:00,608
The Precrime program began in 2046
with a federal grant.

823
01:23:00,782 --> 01:23:06,024
And now, nine years later,
D.C. is the safest city in America.

824
01:23:06,204 --> 01:23:08,576
Why? Because Precrime works.

825
01:23:08,748 --> 01:23:11,998
Precrime has eliminated the need
for conventional detectives.

826
01:23:12,168 --> 01:23:16,995
What happens now is the verification
and protection of future victims.

827
01:23:17,172 --> 01:23:18,797
Can we see the Pre-Cogs?

828
01:23:18,966 --> 01:23:23,462
They have such a powerful gift,
they're kept in peaceful seclusion...

829
01:23:23,637 --> 01:23:25,629
...so as not to be distracted.

830
01:23:25,806 --> 01:23:30,302
This display should give you some idea
of what their daily life is like.

831
01:23:31,061 --> 01:23:34,893
The Pre-Cogs get over
8 million letters every year.

832
01:23:35,065 --> 01:23:37,057
That's more than Santa Claus gets.

833
01:23:37,233 --> 01:23:40,898
Each Pre-Cog has their own bedroom,
TV and weight room.

834
01:23:41,070 --> 01:23:43,229
It's wonderful to be a Pre-Cog.

835
01:24:08,597 --> 01:24:11,170
My mom's new boyfriend
came over again last night.

836
01:24:11,391 --> 01:24:13,633
He's just not very intelligent.

837
01:24:13,810 --> 01:24:19,646
My mom wouldn't let me eat upstairs.
I had to listen to him go on and on.

838
01:24:28,366 --> 01:24:30,109
Shit!

839
01:24:47,968 --> 01:24:50,803
<i>Eye-dent: John Anderton.
Approved for entry.</i>

840
01:24:54,891 --> 01:24:58,805
- Which I told her I'd be able to do.
I'm so good at taking care of you.

841
01:24:58,979 --> 01:25:03,521
But she thinks I'll be irresponsible.
It's ridiculous because...

842
01:25:06,027 --> 01:25:09,811
You can't be in here.
What are you doing here?

843
01:25:14,285 --> 01:25:17,120
Easy there, old-timer.
Who cleared you?

844
01:25:17,288 --> 01:25:19,327
- You're not allowed here.
- Listen, Wally.

845
01:25:19,498 --> 01:25:21,242
- Do I know you?
- I like you.

846
01:25:21,417 --> 01:25:24,501
So I don't wanna have
to kick you or hit you.

847
01:25:24,670 --> 01:25:27,161
But only if you promise to help me.

848
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:30,249
Hi, John.

849
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:41,007
Who does that look like to you?

850
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:44,264
I don't know.

851
01:25:48,109 --> 01:25:52,403
It's Agatha.
He's coming here to get her.

852
01:25:54,574 --> 01:25:58,737
- Are these all of her previsions?
- I'm rewinding her right now.

853
01:26:00,538 --> 01:26:02,910
Just take me to the Leo Crow murder.

854
01:26:03,082 --> 01:26:07,494
They don't come out in any order.
I'm getting them as she's giving them.

855
01:26:10,589 --> 01:26:12,416
Can you see?

856
01:26:25,854 --> 01:26:28,689
- He's inside.
- He has some kind of mask on.

857
01:26:28,857 --> 01:26:30,814
- He sealed the door.
- Shit!

858
01:26:30,984 --> 01:26:33,901
Nobody fires a weapon inside
the temple. Use bindfoam.

859
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:37,521
- Is there another way out of there?
- All the doors are covered.

860
01:26:37,698 --> 01:26:43,322
John, move away from the tank.
Move away from the tank, John.

861
01:27:00,512 --> 01:27:02,421
What does he want with a Pre-Cog?

862
01:27:02,597 --> 01:27:05,800
So he can kill whoever he wants to
without anyone knowing.

863
01:27:05,976 --> 01:27:11,218
Well, there's still the other two.
The other two can still function, right?

864
01:27:11,397 --> 01:27:17,685
They're a hive mind. It takes all three
for their predictive abilities to work.

865
01:27:19,822 --> 01:27:21,731
They can't see murders anymore?

866
01:27:21,908 --> 01:27:25,739
Agatha, she's the key.
She's the one they listen to...

867
01:27:25,911 --> 01:27:28,118
...the one with the most talent.

868
01:27:28,289 --> 01:27:31,704
- She takes care of the other two.
- Jesus.

869
01:27:31,875 --> 01:27:35,955
- Please bring her back.
- Every team underground, now!

870
01:27:36,130 --> 01:27:39,214
- It doesn't matter. He wins.
- We'll stop him.

871
01:27:39,383 --> 01:27:44,258
She's with him when he kills Crow.
She's already a part of his future.

872
01:27:44,429 --> 01:27:47,798
Jad, put everything you've got into
finding that room, and we stop a murder.

873
01:27:47,974 --> 01:27:51,224
- How much time have we got, Gordon?
- We've got...

874
01:27:51,561 --> 01:27:54,099
...51 minutes, 30 seconds.

875
01:27:56,274 --> 01:27:59,275
You cold? Can you understand me?

876
01:27:59,444 --> 01:28:03,393
Are you cold? The shivers,
it's the drugs we gave you.

877
01:28:03,573 --> 01:28:07,866
It should wear off soon.
I'm sorry. I need your help.

878
01:28:08,035 --> 01:28:11,819
You contain information.
I need to know how to get at it.

879
01:28:12,873 --> 01:28:15,827
Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?

880
01:28:16,001 --> 01:28:17,875
- Is it now?
- What?

881
01:28:18,045 --> 01:28:19,872
Is it now?

882
01:28:21,506 --> 01:28:25,006
Yes, this is all happening right now.

883
01:28:25,719 --> 01:28:27,925
I'm taking you some place in public...

884
01:28:28,096 --> 01:28:30,931
...which means you need
something else to wear.

885
01:28:31,099 --> 01:28:35,144
I'm tired. I'm tired of the future.

886
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:44,103
<i>Hello, Mr. Yakamoto,
welcome back to the Gap.</i>

887
01:28:44,278 --> 01:28:47,612
<i>How'd those assorted tank tops
work out for you?</i>

888
01:28:47,949 --> 01:28:50,155
Mr. Yakamoto?

889
01:28:54,288 --> 01:28:59,911
<i>Miss Belfor, did you come back for
another pair of those chammy lace-ups?</i>

890
01:29:13,807 --> 01:29:18,136
- If it's ransom, where's the damn note?
- It has nothing to do with ransom.

891
01:29:18,311 --> 01:29:22,095
It has to do with the information
inside of Agatha.

892
01:29:23,232 --> 01:29:27,811
- He's trying to prove his innocence.
- He can't download her without support.

893
01:29:27,987 --> 01:29:30,560
Your average consumer can't buy
any of this stuff.

894
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:35,236
It's been assembled and scrounged
from spare parts made to order.

895
01:29:36,453 --> 01:29:40,202
Assuming Anderton ordered this,
who put it together?

896
01:29:49,633 --> 01:29:52,717
Who's Rufus T. Riley?

897
01:29:54,846 --> 01:29:57,717
What's your pleasure? We got it
all here: Sports fantasies...

898
01:29:57,891 --> 01:30:00,014
..."Look, Ma, I can fly" fantasies...

899
01:30:00,185 --> 01:30:04,313
...which covers everything from bungee
jumping to flying over the Grand Canyon.

900
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,936
You can experience sex as a woman.

901
01:30:07,108 --> 01:30:10,975
Women come in to get laid
by their favorite soap star.

902
01:30:11,153 --> 01:30:13,988
Or just some good, clean fun.

903
01:30:16,617 --> 01:30:19,618
It's a big rush, but you come out
without a heart attack.

904
01:30:19,787 --> 01:30:22,622
I wanna kill my boss.

905
01:30:24,124 --> 01:30:25,287
Okay.

906
01:30:25,918 --> 01:30:29,867
- You got some images I can work with?
- Rufus.

907
01:30:30,213 --> 01:30:33,665
Yeah, being concertmaster
for the Philadelphia Symphony...

908
01:30:33,842 --> 01:30:35,585
...is a popular choice.

909
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:38,547
- I wanna kill my boss.
- You sick bastard.

910
01:30:38,722 --> 01:30:41,639
You make this a terrible world
to live in!

911
01:30:41,808 --> 01:30:45,971
Detective, nice of you to come here,
seeing how every cop is looking for you.

912
01:30:46,145 --> 01:30:48,815
- I need your help.
- Why'd you come here?

913
01:30:48,981 --> 01:30:52,185
- I make house calls.
- I need your help with her.

914
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:55,978
Hello, honey pie.
I'm impressed. You're on the lam...

915
01:30:56,197 --> 01:31:00,408
...and you still have the time to
slice off a little... jerky for yourself.

916
01:31:00,576 --> 01:31:03,779
- She's a Pre-Cog.
- Oh, yeah, okay.

917
01:31:03,954 --> 01:31:06,196
- That's right.
- She's a Pre-Cog.

918
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,416
You brought a Pre-Cog here.

919
01:31:25,350 --> 01:31:27,342
Jesus Christ.

920
01:31:27,852 --> 01:31:30,770
- Are you reading my mind right now?
- Get up.

921
01:31:31,147 --> 01:31:36,568
I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do.
I swear I didn't do that stuff I did.

922
01:31:38,946 --> 01:31:42,944
She has information inside her.
I need you to get it out.

923
01:31:43,117 --> 01:31:46,320
No way. I wouldn't even know
where to begin.

924
01:31:46,495 --> 01:31:49,946
Those thoughts about my cousin
were just thoughts.

925
01:31:50,124 --> 01:31:52,531
- You've been busted for felony hacking.
- So?

926
01:31:52,709 --> 01:31:55,117
So I need you to hack into her.

927
01:31:58,173 --> 01:32:03,214
I do this, I get to keep
whatever images I get from her head.

928
01:32:03,386 --> 01:32:07,254
- They don't belong to anybody.
- Take her to RadioShack.

929
01:32:08,892 --> 01:32:10,350
You're gonna help me.

930
01:32:16,774 --> 01:32:21,353
Agatha, I need to see. I need to see
what's gonna happen to me.

931
01:32:22,571 --> 01:32:24,315
And then we'll go.

932
01:32:39,254 --> 01:32:41,792
- She works.
- Slow it down.

933
01:32:42,924 --> 01:32:46,708
How do I slow this down?
I should hit her on the head?

934
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:55,684
- Are you recording this?
- Shit.

935
01:32:56,270 --> 01:32:58,062
Yeah, recording.

936
01:33:24,589 --> 01:33:27,211
I know this already.
Come on. Move on.

937
01:33:30,428 --> 01:33:32,053
Goodbye, Crow.

938
01:33:32,931 --> 01:33:34,555
<i>Goodbye, Crow.</i>

939
01:33:42,607 --> 01:33:44,813
- What happened?
- I don't know.

940
01:33:44,984 --> 01:33:46,644
- What happened?
- I don't...

941
01:33:46,819 --> 01:33:50,235
- Where's the rest of it?
- I guess that's all of it.

942
01:33:51,615 --> 01:33:55,613
Where's my Minority Report?

943
01:33:56,995 --> 01:33:59,403
Do I even have one?

944
01:34:04,169 --> 01:34:07,336
- Do I have one?
- No.

945
01:34:09,007 --> 01:34:11,545
- What?
- No.

946
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:20,726
What?

947
01:34:20,935 --> 01:34:24,102
Agatha? What? What?

948
01:34:24,313 --> 01:34:27,148
- Can you see?
- See what?

949
01:34:43,207 --> 01:34:45,080
Anne Lively.

950
01:34:52,966 --> 01:34:57,628
You want me to see who killed
Anne Lively. Are you recording this?

951
01:34:57,804 --> 01:35:00,805
Yeah, but it's pouring
out of her backwards.

952
01:35:06,104 --> 01:35:08,677
I like my life. Everything's good.

953
01:35:19,825 --> 01:35:21,533
They're inside.

954
01:35:22,119 --> 01:35:23,743
Who?

955
01:35:24,746 --> 01:35:26,620
All your old teammates.

956
01:35:27,624 --> 01:35:30,495
Kenny, left chamber.
Alan, straight across.

957
01:35:30,669 --> 01:35:31,700
Negative!

958
01:35:32,838 --> 01:35:34,296
- Negative!
- Negative!

959
01:35:34,464 --> 01:35:35,958
I don't deserve that.

960
01:35:36,132 --> 01:35:38,623
- You are the man.
- No, you're the man.

961
01:35:45,433 --> 01:35:47,675
Can you see the umbrella?

962
01:35:48,227 --> 01:35:49,887
Take it.

963
01:35:50,104 --> 01:35:51,764
Take it!

964
01:35:55,860 --> 01:36:00,403
A man in a blue suit.
He drops his briefcase.

965
01:36:07,621 --> 01:36:11,619
You see a woman in a brown dress.
She knows your face.

966
01:36:13,085 --> 01:36:14,994
Turn in here.

967
01:36:21,634 --> 01:36:23,212
Let's go.

968
01:36:28,725 --> 01:36:30,717
- Wait.
- No, we can't stop here.

969
01:36:30,893 --> 01:36:32,969
Can you see the balloon man?

970
01:36:35,189 --> 01:36:36,648
Wait.

971
01:36:39,401 --> 01:36:43,185
- Wait.
- What are we waiting for?

972
01:36:48,243 --> 01:36:50,450
Wait. Wait.

973
01:36:50,913 --> 01:36:52,490
Wait.

974
01:36:52,914 --> 01:36:56,200
- Please, Mommy, can I have one?
- All right.

975
01:36:58,628 --> 01:36:59,659
Wait.

976
01:37:04,843 --> 01:37:06,752
Thank you.

977
01:37:07,220 --> 01:37:10,340
- Anybody got an ID? Anybody?
- Negative.

978
01:37:10,515 --> 01:37:15,011
Scott, Ramos, take the east end.
Everyone else, follow me. Let's go.

979
01:37:26,739 --> 01:37:29,360
He knows. Don't go home.

980
01:37:37,833 --> 01:37:39,208
We've got eyes on.

981
01:37:39,376 --> 01:37:42,045
They're working,
but they're standing on it.

982
01:37:42,212 --> 01:37:45,129
Please! Please!
Have you got a quarter?

983
01:37:45,298 --> 01:37:47,255
Drop some money.

984
01:37:49,469 --> 01:37:52,423
Can't you put it in my hand?

985
01:37:52,597 --> 01:37:55,218
May the Lord bless you.

986
01:37:55,391 --> 01:37:59,056
May God take care of you.

987
01:38:18,914 --> 01:38:20,076
Damn!

988
01:38:48,859 --> 01:38:52,442
That's the guy.
The man in the window.

989
01:39:08,712 --> 01:39:12,626
- Rooms are 95 a night.
- Mind if I look at the registry?

990
01:39:12,799 --> 01:39:14,542
I mind.

991
01:39:14,968 --> 01:39:16,296
How about now?

992
01:39:16,552 --> 01:39:18,426
Help yourself.

993
01:39:31,984 --> 01:39:33,443
He's here.

994
01:39:34,028 --> 01:39:36,150
Anderton, leave.

995
01:39:43,036 --> 01:39:45,990
You have a choice.
Walk away. Do it now.

996
01:39:46,164 --> 01:39:49,829
I can't. I have to find out
what happened in my life.

997
01:39:50,001 --> 01:39:51,164
Please.

998
01:39:51,336 --> 01:39:55,499
Agatha, I'm not gonna kill the man.
I don't even know him.

999
01:39:55,673 --> 01:39:57,880
- What room is Crow in?
- 1006.

1000
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:00,337
Come on.

1001
01:40:00,636 --> 01:40:01,835
Come on.

1002
01:41:21,089 --> 01:41:22,832
Wrong room.

1003
01:41:51,618 --> 01:41:53,160
Leave.

1004
01:41:53,620 --> 01:41:55,079
Leave.

1005
01:42:51,634 --> 01:42:53,093
Oh, God.

1006
01:42:57,890 --> 01:42:59,171
This is Sean.

1007
01:42:59,809 --> 01:43:01,517
My son.

1008
01:43:05,689 --> 01:43:11,443
Every day for the last six years
I've thought about only two things:

1009
01:43:12,696 --> 01:43:17,109
The first is what my son would
look like if he were alive today...

1010
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:21,943
...if I would recognize him
if I saw him on the street.

1011
01:43:25,542 --> 01:43:29,242
And the second is what I would do
to the man who took him.

1012
01:43:34,133 --> 01:43:35,758
You're right.

1013
01:43:37,178 --> 01:43:38,886
I'm not being set up.

1014
01:43:42,058 --> 01:43:44,513
You have to take me home.

1015
01:43:50,149 --> 01:43:54,098
You said so yourself.
There is no Minority Report.

1016
01:43:54,278 --> 01:43:57,029
I don't have an alternate future.

1017
01:43:58,240 --> 01:44:00,731
I am going to kill this man.

1018
01:44:03,453 --> 01:44:07,747
You still have a choice.
The others never saw their future.

1019
01:44:07,916 --> 01:44:10,537
You still have a choice.

1020
01:44:11,461 --> 01:44:13,952
- Leo Crow?
- Who the hell are you?

1021
01:44:20,052 --> 01:44:21,547
Six years ago, Baltimore...

1022
01:44:21,721 --> 01:44:25,504
...you grabbed a kid at Francis
public pool on the West End.

1023
01:44:25,766 --> 01:44:30,060
Did I? I don't remember
anything about that place.

1024
01:44:34,149 --> 01:44:35,976
Who am I? Who am I?

1025
01:44:36,151 --> 01:44:38,144
Do you know who I am?

1026
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:41,855
- You're somebody's father.
- His name is Sean!

1027
01:44:43,909 --> 01:44:44,940
Sean!

1028
01:44:45,827 --> 01:44:48,911
I told him I was a policeman
and needed his help.

1029
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:54,122
It wasn't so bad. I sang him a song.
I bought him a pretzel.

1030
01:44:54,294 --> 01:44:56,416
He was happy. He was happy.

1031
01:44:56,838 --> 01:44:59,755
Is he alive?
He's alive. Where have you got him?

1032
01:44:59,924 --> 01:45:03,257
Is he all right?
Tell me, you fuck, where is he?!

1033
01:45:03,427 --> 01:45:07,472
I put him in a barrel.
I sunk him in the bay.

1034
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:10,759
He floated back up. I took him out.

1035
01:45:10,976 --> 01:45:14,143
I was gentle. I was gentle.

1036
01:45:15,147 --> 01:45:16,938
I was gentle.

1037
01:45:21,903 --> 01:45:23,148
I'm sorry.

1038
01:45:23,363 --> 01:45:24,526
I'm sorry.

1039
01:45:24,740 --> 01:45:25,938
I'm sorry.

1040
01:45:26,116 --> 01:45:27,278
I'm sorry.

1041
01:45:27,492 --> 01:45:29,983
I'm so very sorry.

1042
01:45:32,247 --> 01:45:34,654
How could you do that to my...?

1043
01:46:07,114 --> 01:46:09,355
You can choose.

1044
01:46:12,994 --> 01:46:14,702
You can choose.

1045
01:46:33,431 --> 01:46:36,135
You have the right to remain silent.

1046
01:46:36,433 --> 01:46:41,095
Anything you say or do can be used
against you in a court of law.

1047
01:46:41,772 --> 01:46:44,263
You have the right to an attorney...

1048
01:46:44,483 --> 01:46:48,860
...now and during any
further questioning.

1049
01:46:49,071 --> 01:46:51,906
If you can't afford an attorney...

1050
01:46:54,075 --> 01:46:56,115
...we will appoint one.

1051
01:46:57,912 --> 01:47:00,664
Do you understand these rights?

1052
01:47:01,624 --> 01:47:03,831
You're not gonna kill me?

1053
01:47:06,629 --> 01:47:10,923
- Do you understand these rights?
- You're not gonna kill me?

1054
01:47:13,803 --> 01:47:17,847
If you don't go through with this,
my family gets nothing.

1055
01:47:18,015 --> 01:47:22,344
You're supposed to kill me.
He said you would.

1056
01:47:23,604 --> 01:47:25,892
He? Who's he?

1057
01:47:26,064 --> 01:47:28,935
I don't know.
He called me in my cell.

1058
01:47:29,109 --> 01:47:33,403
He told me I'd be released if I went
along, and my family would be cared for.

1059
01:47:33,572 --> 01:47:35,232
If you did what?

1060
01:47:35,407 --> 01:47:36,782
If you did what?

1061
01:47:38,451 --> 01:47:41,951
If I acted like I killed your kid.
Okay?

1062
01:47:43,706 --> 01:47:45,829
If you killed my kid?

1063
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,784
Look, you don't kill me,
my family gets nothing. Okay?

1064
01:47:50,421 --> 01:47:52,710
What about the pictures?

1065
01:47:53,424 --> 01:47:57,374
They're fake. He gave them to me.

1066
01:47:57,762 --> 01:48:00,217
Now, listen to me. You...

1067
01:48:00,431 --> 01:48:03,467
You tell me:
Who was it that set this up?

1068
01:48:04,685 --> 01:48:06,642
I don't know.

1069
01:48:06,979 --> 01:48:09,055
- Come on.
- I'm asking you again:

1070
01:48:09,231 --> 01:48:12,434
- Who put you up to this?
- I didn't see his face.

1071
01:48:12,609 --> 01:48:14,436
I tell you who,
and my family gets nothing.

1072
01:48:14,611 --> 01:48:16,817
- Who made you do this?
- Kill me.

1073
01:48:16,988 --> 01:48:19,314
- You can do this. Kill me.
- Tell me.

1074
01:48:19,491 --> 01:48:22,657
- Kill me.
- Leo, let go of the gun.

1075
01:48:22,827 --> 01:48:25,235
Let go of the gun. It's okay.

1076
01:48:27,415 --> 01:48:31,495
Let go of the gun. That's it.
Let go of the gun.

1077
01:48:32,837 --> 01:48:34,913
You're not gonna kill me.

1078
01:48:35,548 --> 01:48:38,003
- Goodbye, Crow.
- Anderton, wait a sec...!

1079
01:48:52,105 --> 01:48:54,063
- Did you see it?
- Stay back!

1080
01:48:54,232 --> 01:48:56,521
What's happening down there?

1081
01:48:57,569 --> 01:48:59,147
Murder!

1082
01:48:59,446 --> 01:49:01,438
Murder!

1083
01:49:03,241 --> 01:49:04,700
Doesn't make sense.

1084
01:49:04,868 --> 01:49:08,948
If you were a child killer,
would you leave these photos out?

1085
01:49:09,122 --> 01:49:11,198
Anderton might have found them.

1086
01:49:11,374 --> 01:49:14,291
- What kind of cop were you before this?
- Treasury agent.

1087
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:18,624
This will be your first murder scene?
I worked homicide before federal.

1088
01:49:18,798 --> 01:49:20,837
This is an orgy of evidence.

1089
01:49:21,008 --> 01:49:25,053
- Know how many orgies I had as a cop?
- How many?

1090
01:49:25,221 --> 01:49:26,549
None.

1091
01:49:31,685 --> 01:49:33,594
This was all arranged.

1092
01:49:33,770 --> 01:49:38,895
<i>Today we saw the first murder in the
six years of the Precrime experiment.</i>

1093
01:49:39,067 --> 01:49:41,736
<i>Sadly enough, this failure was human.</i>

1094
01:49:41,903 --> 01:49:45,237
<i>The protection team
simply didn't get there in time.</i>

1095
01:49:45,407 --> 01:49:50,448
<i>But the murder itself happened exactly
as the Pre-Cogs predicted it would.</i>

1096
01:49:50,620 --> 01:49:54,570
<i>Today's event put a human face
on the Precrime system.</i>

1097
01:49:54,749 --> 01:49:59,126
Danny Witwer's on the phone.
He says it's important.

1098
01:50:01,255 --> 01:50:02,915
Lamar?

1099
01:50:10,055 --> 01:50:12,131
<i>- What?
- There's something wrong.</i>

1100
01:50:12,349 --> 01:50:16,429
<i>We're chasing the wrong man.
I don't wanna say over the phone.</i>

1101
01:50:16,603 --> 01:50:18,347
<i>Meet me at Anderton's.</i>

1102
01:50:18,522 --> 01:50:21,688
We recovered that
from Leo Crow's hotel room.

1103
01:50:27,238 --> 01:50:30,773
I remember when I gave this
to him, back in Baltimore.

1104
01:50:32,118 --> 01:50:33,778
Please, sir.

1105
01:50:36,706 --> 01:50:38,117
Tell me what you have.

1106
01:50:43,170 --> 01:50:46,670
This is the murder of a woman
named Anne Lively.

1107
01:50:48,092 --> 01:50:52,089
John told me about this.
You got this from Containment?

1108
01:50:52,263 --> 01:50:55,299
Yes. This is from the twins,
Arthur and Dashiell.

1109
01:50:55,474 --> 01:50:57,763
Agatha's stream was missing.

1110
01:50:59,311 --> 01:51:01,849
This one is from the Cyber Parlor.

1111
01:51:02,022 --> 01:51:07,147
Anderton downloaded this directly
from Agatha. Rufus Riley recorded it.

1112
01:51:09,696 --> 01:51:13,480
- It's the same prevision.
- Not quite.

1113
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:19,702
Look at the surface wind
across the water. Watch the ripples.

1114
01:51:20,039 --> 01:51:22,910
Moving away from shore.

1115
01:51:24,168 --> 01:51:28,996
Now the second image, the one from
Containment that Art and Dash saw.

1116
01:51:29,340 --> 01:51:31,213
Watch the water.

1117
01:51:32,426 --> 01:51:37,467
The wind's changed.
The ripples are moving the other way.

1118
01:51:38,682 --> 01:51:42,181
This murder's taking place
at two different times.

1119
01:51:42,352 --> 01:51:45,970
Anderton was watching this
right before he was tagged.

1120
01:51:46,148 --> 01:51:49,148
He told me about
the missing data stream.

1121
01:51:49,317 --> 01:51:53,185
- He was concerned you might find it.
- He was right. I did.

1122
01:51:53,363 --> 01:51:55,023
It was inside of Agatha.

1123
01:51:55,198 --> 01:52:00,275
So the question is, why would someone
want this erased from the data file?

1124
01:52:00,453 --> 01:52:04,664
Danny, just tell me
what you're thinking.

1125
01:52:04,874 --> 01:52:07,828
I'm thinking someone
got away with murder.

1126
01:52:08,502 --> 01:52:09,665
How?

1127
01:52:10,046 --> 01:52:14,589
Jad told me that sometimes the Pre-Cogs
see the same murder more than once.

1128
01:52:14,758 --> 01:52:18,626
- It's called an echo.
- Jad called it Pre-Cog déjà vu.

1129
01:52:18,804 --> 01:52:22,387
We teach the techs to identify
and disregard them.

1130
01:52:22,850 --> 01:52:28,188
Yeah, but what if a technician only
thought he was looking at an echo?

1131
01:52:28,355 --> 01:52:33,100
What if he was looking at a completely
different murder altogether?

1132
01:52:33,276 --> 01:52:34,901
I don't understand.

1133
01:52:35,195 --> 01:52:37,483
All you'd have to do is hire someone
to kill Anne Lively...

1134
01:52:37,655 --> 01:52:41,320
...like a drifter, a neuroin addict,
someone with nothing to lose.

1135
01:52:41,492 --> 01:52:44,410
Precrime stops the murder
from taking place...

1136
01:52:44,579 --> 01:52:49,490
...haloes the killer, takes him away.
But then, right then, someone else...

1137
01:52:49,667 --> 01:52:53,747
...having reviewed the prevision
and dressed in the same clothes...

1138
01:52:53,921 --> 01:52:57,705
...commits the murder
in exactly the same way.

1139
01:52:57,883 --> 01:53:03,257
Technician takes a look, thinks he's
looking at an echo, erases it.

1140
01:53:07,768 --> 01:53:12,595
It'd have to be someone with access
to the previsions in the first place.

1141
01:53:12,773 --> 01:53:14,848
Someone fairly high-up.

1142
01:53:17,027 --> 01:53:19,103
Do you know what I hear?

1143
01:53:20,780 --> 01:53:24,149
Nothing.
No footsteps up the stairs.

1144
01:53:24,325 --> 01:53:28,619
No hovercraft out the window.
No clickety-click of little spyders.

1145
01:53:28,788 --> 01:53:30,247
Do you know why?

1146
01:53:30,414 --> 01:53:33,830
Because right now,
the Pre-Cogs can't see a thing.

1147
01:53:58,733 --> 01:54:02,102
Can you see? It's beautiful.

1148
01:54:02,529 --> 01:54:05,980
- Where are we going?
- Someplace safe.

1149
01:54:13,331 --> 01:54:15,288
- Burgess.
- Lamar, it's Lara.

1150
01:54:15,458 --> 01:54:17,996
<i>- Yes, Lara.
- You have to help him.</i>

1151
01:54:19,170 --> 01:54:20,249
Is he there?

1152
01:54:22,756 --> 01:54:24,334
Is the Pre-Cog with him?

1153
01:54:28,345 --> 01:54:30,918
Keep them there. I'm on my way.

1154
01:54:31,098 --> 01:54:34,680
Please don't tell Danny Witwer.
I don't trust him.

1155
01:54:36,019 --> 01:54:38,261
I won't say a word.

1156
01:54:39,147 --> 01:54:43,014
You just don't let John leave,
all right?

1157
01:54:44,652 --> 01:54:46,360
He's no killer, Lamar.

1158
01:54:46,988 --> 01:54:48,186
I know.

1159
01:54:59,917 --> 01:55:01,411
It's cold.

1160
01:55:06,423 --> 01:55:09,424
Lara, this is Agatha.

1161
01:55:14,556 --> 01:55:19,895
<i>You remember when I would read
Tom Sawyer to you and Sean?</i>

1162
01:55:22,731 --> 01:55:28,152
He got so scared when Tom and Becky
were lost in the cave.

1163
01:55:30,613 --> 01:55:32,938
I gotta sit down.

1164
01:55:33,741 --> 01:55:35,900
I gotta figure this out.

1165
01:55:36,411 --> 01:55:38,652
I gotta figure this out.

1166
01:56:18,117 --> 01:56:20,026
They used Sean.

1167
01:56:21,787 --> 01:56:24,622
They wanted me to think
Crow killed him.

1168
01:56:25,791 --> 01:56:27,333
But he didn't.

1169
01:56:28,919 --> 01:56:30,330
He didn't.

1170
01:56:32,089 --> 01:56:34,627
Why would they set you up?

1171
01:56:42,224 --> 01:56:45,141
Because I found out about her.

1172
01:56:46,061 --> 01:56:47,852
About who?

1173
01:56:48,063 --> 01:56:51,847
- How could I not have seen this?
- Seen what?

1174
01:56:53,068 --> 01:56:55,143
Anne Lively.

1175
01:56:57,655 --> 01:56:59,149
Agatha.

1176
01:57:03,870 --> 01:57:06,989
Dr. Hineman once said,
"The dead don't die...

1177
01:57:07,164 --> 01:57:09,240
...they look on and help. "

1178
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,242
Remember that, John.

1179
01:57:13,337 --> 01:57:14,500
Agatha.

1180
01:57:14,672 --> 01:57:16,296
Sean.

1181
01:57:20,427 --> 01:57:22,883
He's on the beach now...

1182
01:57:23,513 --> 01:57:25,755
...toe in the water.

1183
01:57:26,850 --> 01:57:29,685
He's asking you to come in with him.

1184
01:57:30,353 --> 01:57:33,722
He's been racing his mother
up and down the sand.

1185
01:57:35,525 --> 01:57:38,395
There's so much love in this house.

1186
01:57:43,408 --> 01:57:45,317
He's 10 years old.

1187
01:57:47,745 --> 01:57:50,414
He's surrounded by animals.

1188
01:57:51,665 --> 01:57:53,954
He wants to be a vet.

1189
01:57:55,794 --> 01:58:00,540
You keep a rabbit for him,
a bird and a fox.

1190
01:58:02,050 --> 01:58:03,877
He's in high school.

1191
01:58:04,386 --> 01:58:07,221
He likes to run, like his father.

1192
01:58:07,723 --> 01:58:11,056
He runs the two-mile
and the long relay.

1193
01:58:12,394 --> 01:58:14,137
He's 23.

1194
01:58:15,563 --> 01:58:17,805
He's at a university.

1195
01:58:18,274 --> 01:58:21,477
He makes love
to a pretty girl named Claire.

1196
01:58:21,653 --> 01:58:24,108
He asks her to be his wife.

1197
01:58:24,739 --> 01:58:28,357
He calls here and tells Lara,
who cries.

1198
01:58:29,994 --> 01:58:31,987
He still runs...

1199
01:58:32,204 --> 01:58:36,451
...across the university and
in the stadium, where John watches.

1200
01:58:36,667 --> 01:58:41,210
Oh, God. He's running so fast,
just like his daddy.

1201
01:58:41,797 --> 01:58:46,008
He sees his daddy.
He wants to run to him.

1202
01:58:47,469 --> 01:58:52,047
But he's only 6 years old,
and he can't do it.

1203
01:58:52,557 --> 01:58:54,882
And the other man is so fast.

1204
01:58:58,730 --> 01:59:01,482
There was so much love in this house.

1205
01:59:02,734 --> 01:59:05,059
I want him back so bad.

1206
01:59:07,572 --> 01:59:09,363
So did she.

1207
01:59:10,074 --> 01:59:11,782
Can't you see?

1208
01:59:15,621 --> 01:59:18,824
She just wanted her little girl back.

1209
01:59:21,001 --> 01:59:23,243
But it was too late.

1210
01:59:24,922 --> 01:59:27,413
Her little girl was already gone.

1211
01:59:28,175 --> 01:59:29,752
She's still alive.

1212
01:59:31,386 --> 01:59:33,260
She didn't die.

1213
01:59:33,680 --> 01:59:35,589
But she's not alive.

1214
01:59:37,434 --> 01:59:38,928
Agatha?

1215
01:59:41,563 --> 01:59:42,938
Just tell me...

1216
01:59:43,523 --> 01:59:45,599
...who killed your mother?

1217
01:59:46,276 --> 01:59:48,398
Who killed Anne Lively?

1218
01:59:50,029 --> 01:59:54,940
I'm sorry, John,
but you're gonna have to run again.

1219
01:59:55,743 --> 01:59:57,901
- What?
- Run!

1220
02:00:14,761 --> 02:00:16,421
I love you.

1221
02:00:17,305 --> 02:00:20,092
- It's okay.
- You'll be fine with them.

1222
02:00:20,267 --> 02:00:23,054
- No! No!
- Stay with me. Stay with me.

1223
02:00:23,228 --> 02:00:25,683
- John, no.
- Don't talk.

1224
02:00:43,164 --> 02:00:44,492
John Anderton.

1225
02:00:45,791 --> 02:00:48,994
By mandate of the D.C.
Precrime Division...

1226
02:00:49,169 --> 02:00:54,330
...I'm placing you under arrest for the
murders of Leo Crow and Danny Witwer.

1227
02:00:57,511 --> 02:00:59,135
That's it.

1228
02:00:59,554 --> 02:01:01,298
That's my girl.

1229
02:01:03,141 --> 02:01:05,430
I was so worried about you.

1230
02:01:09,481 --> 02:01:11,272
Did he hurt you?

1231
02:01:14,319 --> 02:01:15,943
I missed you so much.

1232
02:01:16,112 --> 02:01:18,354
It's okay. Wally's here.

1233
02:01:19,073 --> 02:01:20,484
Wally's here.

1234
02:01:25,663 --> 02:01:29,079
You're a part of my flock now, John.

1235
02:01:29,291 --> 02:01:30,785
Welcome.

1236
02:01:31,752 --> 02:01:36,295
It's actually kind of a rush.
They say you have visions...

1237
02:01:36,465 --> 02:01:39,549
...that your life flashes
before your eyes...

1238
02:01:39,718 --> 02:01:43,169
...that all your dreams come true.

1239
02:01:59,946 --> 02:02:02,234
This is all my fault.

1240
02:02:03,241 --> 02:02:05,814
There was nothing anyone could do.

1241
02:02:10,247 --> 02:02:13,034
I thought you might want
to have those.

1242
02:02:18,839 --> 02:02:23,916
I haven't worn this in years. I wanted
to make sure it fits before tonight.

1243
02:02:24,094 --> 02:02:25,422
You look great.

1244
02:02:25,595 --> 02:02:29,842
I knew he was having trouble
for some time, yet I did nothing.

1245
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:33,551
<i>- The guy from USA Today is here.
- Tell him not now.</i>

1246
02:02:33,728 --> 02:02:37,179
- He just wanted a few minutes before...
- Not now!

1247
02:02:39,734 --> 02:02:43,269
- I thought you were retiring.
- Well, I was.

1248
02:02:43,488 --> 02:02:49,241
But this incident with John made me
realize the fragility of all this.

1249
02:02:49,785 --> 02:02:53,119
This is John's legacy
as much as it is my own.

1250
02:02:53,914 --> 02:02:57,365
Now I have an obligation
to protect that.

1251
02:02:57,918 --> 02:03:01,453
Lara, I know how difficult
this is for you.

1252
02:03:01,630 --> 02:03:04,999
But maybe you can find
some closure in the fact...

1253
02:03:05,175 --> 02:03:09,636
...that John finally found
the man who killed your son.

1254
02:03:12,474 --> 02:03:13,802
Who's Anne Lively?

1255
02:03:16,644 --> 02:03:19,100
- Who?
- Anne Lively.

1256
02:03:19,564 --> 02:03:23,478
John was talking about her
right before they took him.

1257
02:03:23,651 --> 02:03:25,809
I don't know who that is.

1258
02:03:26,988 --> 02:03:32,195
John said something about him being
set up because he found out about her.

1259
02:03:32,368 --> 02:03:37,326
- Well, we know why John was tagged.
- He also said Crow was a fake.

1260
02:03:37,498 --> 02:03:42,041
And Witwer? He was killed with
John's gun inside John's apartment.

1261
02:03:42,211 --> 02:03:46,422
Do you know the reason why
John came here to work for you?

1262
02:03:46,590 --> 02:03:47,965
- Sean.
- Yes.

1263
02:03:48,759 --> 02:03:52,044
He came here to work for you
because he thought...

1264
02:03:52,220 --> 02:03:56,847
...if he could just stop
that kind of thing from happening...

1265
02:03:57,517 --> 02:04:00,720
- I understand.
- No, I don't think you do.

1266
02:04:00,895 --> 02:04:05,640
Sir, they wanna start
the press conference in two minutes.

1267
02:04:05,817 --> 02:04:06,979
Lara...

1268
02:04:07,443 --> 02:04:10,314
...John was the best cop I ever knew...

1269
02:04:10,529 --> 02:04:13,364
...and, in some ways,
also the best man.

1270
02:04:13,532 --> 02:04:15,988
But the scars he carried around...

1271
02:04:16,160 --> 02:04:21,534
Well, I know he'd want us to honor
the good things we remember about him.

1272
02:04:21,707 --> 02:04:27,377
And I also know why he married you:
You're as stubborn as he is.

1273
02:04:27,546 --> 02:04:31,923
- Lamar...
- Do you know how to tie one of these?

1274
02:04:32,092 --> 02:04:36,504
Could you please give me a hand?
I'm all thumbs, as you see.

1275
02:04:44,354 --> 02:04:47,141
Listen, I'll tell you what I'll do.

1276
02:04:47,315 --> 02:04:51,609
First thing Monday,
I'll look over the Witwer evidence.

1277
02:04:51,777 --> 02:04:55,442
And I'll have Gideon
run the Containment files...

1278
02:04:55,614 --> 02:04:58,651
...see if anyone drowned a woman
by the name of...

1279
02:04:58,826 --> 02:05:01,613
What did you say her name was?

1280
02:05:03,706 --> 02:05:05,413
Anne Lively.

1281
02:05:06,041 --> 02:05:08,579
But I never said she drowned.

1282
02:05:28,438 --> 02:05:33,265
- Sir, the press conference is starting.
- I'll be right there.

1283
02:05:37,947 --> 02:05:40,354
We'll talk about this later.

1284
02:05:41,116 --> 02:05:45,695
Perhaps tomorrow,
I'll come by the cottage.

1285
02:06:22,448 --> 02:06:24,986
I'd like a word with my husband.

1286
02:06:25,701 --> 02:06:28,737
You're not authorized.

1287
02:06:28,954 --> 02:06:31,659
How did you get in here?

1288
02:06:40,340 --> 02:06:41,668
Thank you.

1289
02:06:41,842 --> 02:06:47,180
Ladies and gentlemen, Lamar Burgess,
director of the new National Precrime.

1290
02:06:49,807 --> 02:06:53,675
On behalf of your staff,
we present you with this.

1291
02:06:53,853 --> 02:06:57,685
- Congratulations, sir.
- My God.

1292
02:06:58,816 --> 02:07:00,310
How did you get this?

1293
02:07:00,484 --> 02:07:03,604
I padded your expense account
for six months.

1294
02:07:06,031 --> 02:07:09,863
Revolvers like this one
were given to generals...

1295
02:07:10,035 --> 02:07:13,202
...at the end of the Civil War
by their troops.

1296
02:07:13,372 --> 02:07:17,321
The cylinders were loaded
with five gold-plated bullets...

1297
02:07:17,501 --> 02:07:20,786
...to symbolize the end
of the destruction and death...

1298
02:07:20,962 --> 02:07:23,453
...that had ripped the country apart
for five years.

1299
02:07:23,632 --> 02:07:27,131
Ladies and gentlemen,
with Precrime going national...

1300
02:07:27,302 --> 02:07:31,346
...maybe we can all look forward
to a time when none of us...

1301
02:07:31,514 --> 02:07:34,848
...will have to discharge
another firearm ever again.

1302
02:07:36,185 --> 02:07:40,894
Now enjoy yourselves.
Enjoy yourselves! That's an order.

1303
02:07:43,776 --> 02:07:48,070
Does this mean we can finally use
the lake house on weekends?

1304
02:07:50,824 --> 02:07:52,069
Hello.

1305
02:07:52,242 --> 02:07:54,733
Yes. Right away.

1306
02:07:55,037 --> 02:07:58,156
- Excuse me, so sorry.
- Excuse me.

1307
02:07:58,373 --> 02:07:59,749
- Sir?
- Yes.

1308
02:07:59,917 --> 02:08:03,617
Sir, you have an emergency call
on your private line.

1309
02:08:04,713 --> 02:08:06,421
Yes, this is Burgess.

1310
02:08:06,590 --> 02:08:11,168
<i>Hello, Lamar. I just wanted
to congratulate you. You did it.</i>

1311
02:08:11,344 --> 02:08:13,835
<i>You created a world without murder.</i>

1312
02:08:14,013 --> 02:08:17,180
Everyone wants your name on a hat.
Can you sign these?

1313
02:08:17,350 --> 02:08:19,805
<i>All you had to do was kill someone
to do it.</i>

1314
02:08:24,565 --> 02:08:25,596
A-room. Jad.

1315
02:08:26,609 --> 02:08:29,942
Jad, it's Lara. John needs a favor.

1316
02:08:30,154 --> 02:08:34,732
<i>- What are you talking about?
- Agatha's mother, Anne Lively.</i>

1317
02:08:34,908 --> 02:08:39,238
<i>Just a junkie who had a kid once
and had to give her up, but surprise!</i>

1318
02:08:39,413 --> 02:08:42,367
<i>She cleaned herself up,
and she wanted her daughter back.</i>

1319
02:08:42,541 --> 02:08:44,498
<i>She wanted Agatha.</i>

1320
02:08:47,003 --> 02:08:51,416
Jad, you getting this? It's from the
female only. No time or incident data.

1321
02:08:51,591 --> 02:08:54,047
It isn't the future.
It already happened.

1322
02:08:54,219 --> 02:08:57,967
<i>And the problem was, without Agatha,
there was no Precrime.</i>

1323
02:08:58,139 --> 02:09:02,931
<i>She's the strongest of the three.
Without Agatha, you had nothing.</i>

1324
02:09:03,102 --> 02:09:08,523
<i>You wouldn't be where you are now,
standing there, signing autographs.</i>

1325
02:09:16,365 --> 02:09:19,781
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing with that?

1326
02:09:19,952 --> 02:09:23,534
- What you up to, big man?
- Think before you send that.

1327
02:09:23,705 --> 02:09:24,737
Slow down.

1328
02:09:45,351 --> 02:09:50,060
<i>Now you had to get rid of Anne Lively,
which presented a problem:</i>

1329
02:09:50,231 --> 02:09:53,896
<i>How can you kill her
without the Pre-Cogs seeing it?</i>

1330
02:09:54,068 --> 02:09:58,315
<i>Simple. Use a system
you control against her.</i>

1331
02:09:58,530 --> 02:10:03,738
<i>You hired someone to kill her, knowing
the Pre-Cogs would see that murder.</i>

1332
02:10:03,911 --> 02:10:07,445
<i>You lured Anne Lively
out to the lake...</i>

1333
02:10:07,623 --> 02:10:11,620
<i>... with the promise of reuniting her
with her daughter.</i>

1334
02:10:56,127 --> 02:10:58,120
<i>Where's my daughter?</i>

1335
02:11:05,386 --> 02:11:06,584
<i>Where?</i>

1336
02:11:08,639 --> 02:11:09,920
Run!

1337
02:11:13,352 --> 02:11:14,467
Run!

1338
02:11:26,115 --> 02:11:29,448
<i>When you were all alone,
you killed her yourself...</i>

1339
02:11:29,618 --> 02:11:33,568
<i>... in the same way the Pre-Cogs
predicted your John Doe would kill her.</i>

1340
02:11:33,747 --> 02:11:36,664
<i>You made the real murder
look like an echo...</i>

1341
02:11:36,833 --> 02:11:41,578
<i>... knowing the tech would do what
he was trained to do: Disregard it.</i>

1342
02:11:47,343 --> 02:11:51,804
<i>Anne Lively became
just another missing person.</i>

1343
02:11:52,432 --> 02:11:55,598
<i>So, what are you gonna do, Lamar?</i>

1344
02:11:56,352 --> 02:11:58,261
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

1345
02:12:09,406 --> 02:12:10,735
We got a Red Ball!

1346
02:12:16,913 --> 02:12:19,831
Think about the lives
that little girl has saved.

1347
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,870
Think about the lives
that little girl has saved.

1348
02:12:23,044 --> 02:12:27,623
Think of all the lives she will save.
She could have saved Sean.

1349
02:12:27,799 --> 02:12:30,372
Don't you ever say his name!

1350
02:12:32,595 --> 02:12:35,762
You used the memory of my dead son
to set me up.

1351
02:12:35,932 --> 02:12:38,932
You used the memory of my dead son
to set me up.

1352
02:12:39,101 --> 02:12:42,102
You knew that would
drive me to murder.

1353
02:12:42,271 --> 02:12:45,687
- What are you gonna do now, Lamar?
- What are you gonna do now, Lamar?

1354
02:12:45,858 --> 02:12:47,850
- How are you gonna...?
- Shut me up?

1355
02:12:48,027 --> 02:12:50,352
Forgive me, John.

1356
02:12:58,704 --> 02:13:00,495
<i>Forgive me, John.</i>

1357
02:13:12,091 --> 02:13:13,420
Lamar.

1358
02:13:13,843 --> 02:13:15,254
It's over.

1359
02:13:15,928 --> 02:13:21,219
The question you have to ask is,
what are you gonna do now?

1360
02:13:34,405 --> 02:13:37,441
No doubt the Pre-Cogs have
already seen this.

1361
02:13:37,616 --> 02:13:39,276
No doubt.

1362
02:13:40,285 --> 02:13:42,610
You see the dilemma, don't you?

1363
02:13:43,288 --> 02:13:47,701
If you don't kill me, Pre-Cogs were
wrong and Precrime is over.

1364
02:13:48,752 --> 02:13:52,286
If you do kill me, you go away...

1365
02:13:52,797 --> 02:13:57,258
...but it proves the system works.
Pre-Cogs were right.

1366
02:14:03,349 --> 02:14:06,718
So, what are you gonna do now?

1367
02:14:08,020 --> 02:14:10,013
What's it worth?

1368
02:14:10,815 --> 02:14:13,140
Just one more murder.

1369
02:14:15,986 --> 02:14:21,111
You'll rot in hell with a halo, but
people will still believe in Precrime.

1370
02:14:21,283 --> 02:14:25,327
All you have to do is kill me,
like they said you would.

1371
02:14:28,665 --> 02:14:30,243
Except...

1372
02:14:31,126 --> 02:14:33,581
...you know your own future...

1373
02:14:33,795 --> 02:14:37,413
...which means you can change it
if you want to.

1374
02:14:38,466 --> 02:14:41,502
You still have a choice, Lamar.

1375
02:14:41,969 --> 02:14:43,843
Like I did.

1376
02:14:48,517 --> 02:14:51,269
Yes, I have a choice...

1377
02:14:52,563 --> 02:14:54,556
...and I made it.

1378
02:14:55,482 --> 02:14:57,475
Forgive me, John.

1379
02:14:59,069 --> 02:15:00,861
Forgive me.

1380
02:15:06,118 --> 02:15:07,826
Forgive me, my boy.

1381
02:15:26,471 --> 02:15:28,048
Lamar!

1382
02:15:39,233 --> 02:15:44,060
<i>In 2054, the six-year Precrime
experiment was abandoned.</i>

1383
02:15:51,495 --> 02:15:54,994
<i>All prisoners were unconditionally
pardoned and released...</i>

1384
02:15:55,165 --> 02:15:59,458
<i>... although police departments
kept watch on many of them for years.</i>

1385
02:16:47,215 --> 02:16:49,587
<i>Agatha and the twins...</i>

1386
02:16:49,759 --> 02:16:53,128
<i>... were transferred
to an undisclosed location...</i>

1387
02:16:53,971 --> 02:16:57,554
<i>... a place where they could
find relief from their gifts...</i>

1388
02:16:57,850 --> 02:17:01,848
<i>... a place where they could
live out their lives in peace.</i>
