1
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,083
He's out.

2
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:43,252
What do you mean?

3
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,045
Sylvester. He's escaped.

4
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:46,338
Impossible.

5
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,090
Maximum alert.

6
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,306
Damn it!

7
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,892
He's been spotted on the mezzanine.

8
00:00:59,101 --> 00:00:59,935
Secure perimeters.

9
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,938
Alert topside. Initiate probers. Move!

10
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:04,606
Move! Move!

11
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,987
He's exiting the building. Move out.

12
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,663
There he is. Nail him.

13
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:24,793
He's heading for the maze.
We've got him.

14
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:29,381
Cut him off!

15
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,049
Toward the fountain.

16
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,052
There he goes. He's headed back.

17
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,805
Coming back, toward the fountain.

18
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,933
He's approaching the fountain.
Seal him off.

19
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,228
We've got him.

20
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,981
Be careful. He's dangerous.

21
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,570
There's nowhere to go, Sly.

22
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,072
Give it up.

23
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,284
Security.

24
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,077
Go.

25
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,038
The rest of you, come with me.

26
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,223
Check the perimeters.

27
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,583
Nice try, pal.

28
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,050
Take him.

29
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,063
Stop him!

30
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,010
That'll be quite enough, Sylvester.

31
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,636
There you are, doc.

32
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,680
He nearly made it this time.

33
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,350
Tomorrow you will explain how
a mere toddler manages to escape...

34
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:50,063
from a laboratory
25 stories below ground.

35
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:51,940
What kind of kids you breeding?

36
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,568
Nearly blew us away with karate.

37
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,612
Remarkable.

38
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:01,658
Once again we demonstrate
the superiority of the Kinder method.

39
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,287
Take him to the secret lab.

40
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,094
Operation Twincomp, access requested.

41
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,890
Analysing voiceprint.

42
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,808
Review project in summary form.

43
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:27,893
Twincomp...

44
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:32,731
is designed to prove the superiority
of the Kinder method of child rearing.

45
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,736
To accomplish this, two years ago,
twin brothers Sylvester and Whit...

46
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,864
were born to a specially selected
surrogate mother.

47
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,951
Director of operations,
Dr Elena Kinder, arranged...

48
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,412
for Whit to be adopted
into the home of her niece...

49
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,916
and her niece's husband,
Dr Dan Bobbins.

50
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,461
Sly was placed in the Babyco
Hyper-Developmental Habitat...

51
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,589
to be raised under the guidance
of the Kinder method.

52
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,050
Summarize operational protocol.

53
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:02,719
It is imperative for the integrity
of this experiment...

54
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:06,348
that no one ever discover
that Sly and Whit are twins...

55
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,559
especially the boys themselves.

56
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:12,229
A comparative evaluation of the boys
will occur by age 6...

57
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,233
to establish conclusively the
superiority of the Kinder method.

58
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,277
Updating experiment log.

59
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:22,197
Last night, Baby Sylvester made his way
up 25 stories, undetected...

60
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,950
escaping from his habitat
in a secret lab.

61
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:28,161
Even though it now appears
that Sly cannot be controlled...

62
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:32,958
Dr Kinder will be pleased by this
display of skill and intelligence.

63
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,003
I however, remain apprehensive.

64
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,974
Under the guidance of its chairman,
Dr Elena Kinder...

65
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:52,477
Baby Geniuses lnc.
And its parent company Babyco...

66
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:56,607
are the world's largest manufacturer
of products for the baby.

67
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,776
Babyco is also a vital
charitable organization...

68
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:03,739
which sponsors orphanages
in 10 countries around the globe.

69
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:08,452
The latest one dedicatedjust a week
ago, right here in Pasadena.

70
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,247
Today we are deeper
in Dr Kinder's debt...

71
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,417
for the extraordinary gift.

72
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:20,130
Joyworld, the world's largest
indoor amusement park.

73
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:26,637
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
the founder and CEO of Babyco...

74
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,640
my friend, Dr Elena Kinder.

75
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,227
Thank you.

76
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:34,394
Thank you.

77
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,732
I'm gonna break out.

78
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:42,444
You can't get hives just because
your aunt comes into the room.

79
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:45,530
I can't help it. She starts lying.
I start breaking out.

80
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,742
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all
for coming here today.

81
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:52,496
We at Babyco believe that babies
have a language of their own.

82
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,623
We're dedicated to proving it.

83
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:59,336
Our research in infant potentiality
is the model of the field.

84
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,713
But in the final analysis...

85
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:05,842
the simple answer as to
why we do what we do is...

86
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,719
we love babies.

87
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,764
Loves babies.

88
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,057
Loves money.

89
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:16,019
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
Let's have a party.

90
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,189
Welcome to Joyworld.

91
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,794
Look, it's a roller coaster!

92
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:50,095
So the park, of course,
will be free for all children.

93
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,431
But the money collected
from adults...

94
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,018
will go to the Babyco
Worldwide Orphanage Foundation.

95
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:58,812
Is this a terrific lady, or what?

96
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,899
This is kind of great.

97
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:04,276
She does a lot of good.

98
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,653
She's good at stealing your ideas.

99
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:07,738
Attention!

100
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,823
Has anyone lost a baby?

101
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,159
A very big baby?

102
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,244
Ladies and gentlemen...

103
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,746
Baby Bunting!

104
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,457
That looks like your illustration.

105
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:21,501
That looks like Boo Boo Boy
from Baby's Good Day.

106
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:24,379
Bunting came into this world
just last week.

107
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,591
Now, everything is fully controlled...

108
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,344
by our computerized command centre.

109
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,054
Hiya, fellas.

110
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,099
And now go to crossover mode.

111
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:39,519
Okay, Richard.
Give me Baby Bunting vocal.

112
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,939
What's your name, little girl?

113
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,690
Erin. My name is Erin.

114
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:46,485
What a sweet name.

115
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,321
Give Baby Bunting a big hug.

116
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:51,907
And cue burp...

117
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:52,991
now.

118
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:58,247
Well! Think about changing his diaper.

119
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,749
Come on, honey. This way.

120
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,584
Kids, good news!

121
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:05,003
Robotic Santa and the robotic elves...

122
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,590
are waiting to greet you
at the robotic North Pole.

123
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,427
In fact, we have robotic entertainers
located throughout the park...

124
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:15,847
all controlled from our
central command centre.

125
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,267
Okay, let's cue up for Robo-Zoo.

126
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:21,687
And here we have the world's
most unique animal farm.

127
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,438
We call it Robo-Zoo.

128
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,024
Each child gets a remote control...

129
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:28,652
to control their own robotic animal.

130
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,446
Why wouldn't you have
real animals in your zoo?

131
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:33,991
Good heavens! Anybody could do that.

132
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,619
Plastic zoo.
That's definitely Aunt Elena's idea.

133
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:39,913
At least she could have introduced you.

134
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,916
She steals from your books,
from your research.

135
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,084
I'm flattered.

136
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:47,004
She knows about your breakthrough
in infant language.

137
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,381
She'll probably try to steal that too.

138
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,800
You make her sound
like Attila the Hun.

139
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:57,264
Honey, we're barely able to afford your
research facility and the preschool.

140
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,726
She does this all the time.
It's just not right.

141
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,061
I think she's just goal-oriented.

142
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,522
Her goal is to take
over the world. I know.

143
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,983
I lived with her
for more than half my life.

144
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,277
And look how great you turned out.

145
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,959
Lenny?

146
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:33,759
Where are you going
with those children?

147
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,886
What children? These are not children.

148
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,139
These are plumbers.
They're gonna help me fix the sink.

149
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:40,182
Good-luck kiss.

150
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,517
With this house, you
need more than luck.

151
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,144
Okay, let's get to work.

152
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:47,773
Just as you thought, our line
of expandable infant clothing...

153
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:50,901
has elicited a tremendous
response in our first pass.

154
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,446
Huge numbers from the Kmart
and Wal-Mart shoppers.

155
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,741
That should increase our market share.
Put it in production.

156
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,285
Tell me of the new ones.
How many possibles?

157
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,788
- Eight show potential.
- Eight out of 500?

158
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:06,792
Elena, statistically, genius occurs
once in 10,000 individuals.

159
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:11,004
We expected only five geniuses
from the Pasadena Orphanage.

160
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:12,172
We've got eight.

161
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:14,107
Don't tell me how well we're doing.

162
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:18,303
Our orphanages and secret labs
are costing us 200 million a year.

163
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:23,308
The sole purpose of these orphanages is
to allow us to cull out the geniuses...

164
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,727
- the natural leaders.
- We'll do better.

165
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,355
I'll settle for a few more
like Sylvester.

166
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:30,524
Look at what that crackerjack did.

167
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:34,486
All our emphasis has been on
keeping the world out of a secret lab.

168
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,781
No one ever considered
the possibility of a baby escaping.

169
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:42,452
Just look at this wonderful world we've
created for our babies to grow up in.

170
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:45,163
Why would anyone
want to escape from here?

171
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:50,252
The one who did is in the work station,
no doubt planning his next escape.

172
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,177
Hello, Sylvester.

173
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:03,015
- What's he constructing?
- We don't know.

174
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:05,309
He builds all kinds
of extraordinary things.

175
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,936
For all kinds of extraordinary purposes.

176
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,980
Just look at that intensity.

177
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,441
There's no other baby like Sylvester.

178
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,276
Well, maybe one.

179
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:15,903
His twin, Whit?

180
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,447
Whit!

181
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,241
Mayday!

182
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,453
Whitley, where is helper number one?

183
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,080
Give me the lug wrench. Whit, hurry up.

184
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:28,749
Go! On the double!

185
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,130
Oh, mama!

186
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:39,801
Mama.

187
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:42,804
Listen, you monkey.

188
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,640
This is a monkey wrench!

189
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:47,809
Plumber's helper number one,
you're fired. Get out of town.

190
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,940
What is that terrible noise?

191
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:55,609
Noise to us.

192
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,570
But the computers analyse
every possible permutation.

193
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:02,950
What we hear as incoherent noise
may actually be a musical masterpiece.

194
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,495
Listen to our computer's
interpretation of Basil's playing.

195
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:10,249
That's remarkable.

196
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:14,127
It has all the complexities
of a symphony by Haydn or Beethoven.

197
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:15,504
If that's the case...

198
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:20,425
it's possible that what we hear
as baby talk is actually conversation.

199
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:25,430
Exactly. And look at this.
A child writing on a pad, right? No.

200
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,641
After checking all languages...

201
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,686
we found out they're writing
the cuneiform language.

202
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,688
They speak their own language.

203
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,023
They understand all others.

204
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:36,733
Now watch this.

205
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:43,615
Subject One speaks, and we
immediately see activity here...

206
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,742
in the lower limbic region...

207
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:48,287
while Subject Two, as he listens...

208
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:50,664
is active in the forebrain.

209
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:54,710
These babies are having a conversation.
We just don't understand them.

210
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,963
The instant a child begins
to speak in any known language...

211
00:13:58,213 --> 00:13:59,923
the limbic activity ceases.

212
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,091
As though they forget.

213
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,385
Exactly. Bobbins was right.

214
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:06,930
What if the limbic activity
is not merely speech?

215
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,016
What if it's stored knowledge...

216
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:11,393
from an early-parent gene pool?

217
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:14,104
Passed from generation to generation.

218
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:15,314
Amazing!

219
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,524
They may know
the secrets of the universe.

220
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:20,110
The greatest breakthrough in history!

221
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:21,153
Change humanity!

222
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:23,780
If we find the key to the human mind...

223
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:26,491
every child will be
educated in my method.

224
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:29,703
Every great mind will be ours to mold.

225
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:33,415
Let's get them all
into the amphitheatre.

226
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,939
Hello, my little baby geniuses.

227
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,150
What are we discussing today?

228
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:03,904
Could it be postmodern
ethical construction?

229
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,322
How about...

230
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,909
the mechanics of human knowledge?

231
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,539
My little Sly one.

232
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:16,875
Sly, tell me...

233
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,920
what are you thinking?

234
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,881
Come on. You can look at me.

235
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,801
What are you thinking?

236
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,719
What are you saying?

237
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,722
Enlighten me, my little Einstein.

238
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:41,024
What do you think?
Should I enlighten her?

239
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,068
She won't understand.

240
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:45,445
She doesn't speak our language.

241
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,573
But go ahead. Have fun.

242
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,909
Lead us through the wilderness,
my little warrior.

243
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:54,496
All right, all right. That does it.

244
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:58,041
Doc, if you're gonna talk
out of your ass all the time...

245
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:00,586
maybe you should wear
a bow tie on your butt.

246
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,630
Bow tie? On her butt?

247
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:05,883
On her butt?

248
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,761
That's disgusting, Sylvester.

249
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,140
You know...

250
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:17,185
you think because I don't understand
you, I don't understand what's going on.

251
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,938
Don't be too sure about that, honey.

252
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:22,900
Yeah, right. And don't call me honey.

253
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,069
Okay, Sly man, one.

254
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,030
Dr Kinder, zip.

255
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,449
You're always busting her chops.

256
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:34,912
Are you kidding? Give me a break.
She's Darth Vader in a skirt.

257
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:37,372
Dr Kinder's our benefactor.

258
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:40,167
Because of her,
there will be a new order...

259
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:42,586
and we will be its leaders.

260
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:44,713
Don't have a cow, Basil.

261
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,548
Why do you talk like that?

262
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:49,134
Your syntax is atrocious.

263
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,678
It's because he watches TV all the time.

264
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:53,305
How does he do that?

265
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,515
He converts the monitors.

266
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,476
You ought to all watch TV.

267
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,853
Check out the real world,
like Jerry Springer.

268
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:00,979
And have fun.

269
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,398
This is exactly what Dr Kinder...

270
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:05,067
is trying to overcome.

271
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,777
Moral decay.

272
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:08,987
Now you sound like Heep.

273
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,865
Discipline, discipline, discipline.

274
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:13,700
Reward and deprive.

275
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,995
Give the babies a crumb. Take it away.

276
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:21,625
Like Pavlov's dogs. Hold up the bone,
the doggies salivate.

277
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,212
If they behave,
give them a little gristle.

278
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:26,880
If you don't like it...

279
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,924
why don't you just leave?

280
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:30,759
He'll just take the next bus.

281
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:33,929
You're such a weasel, Basil.

282
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,432
Nice face, weasel.

283
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,774
You fool. Dr Heep is watching.

284
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:49,319
Don't mess with the Sly man, Heepster.

285
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,624
We're back!

286
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,877
Dickie?

287
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:10,507
Where is he?

288
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,426
Carrie? Whit?

289
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,595
The kids aren't here.

290
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:16,722
Wait a minute. Hello?

291
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:18,599
Anybody?

292
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:23,186
Whit? Is that you?

293
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:28,358
What's this mess? Look at this water.

294
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,652
No fraternizing with the help!

295
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:33,572
Carrie, look at you.
You are soaking wet.

296
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:36,783
You are soaking wet. And look at Whit.

297
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:42,623
You know what? You two go for a swim...

298
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:46,501
and Uncle Lenny and I
are gonna have a little talk, okay?

299
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:50,339
This water here on the floor.
Is it dangerous?

300
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:52,424
Please. The power's out, anyway.

301
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:53,592
The power's out?

302
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:55,594
Great. Where's Dickie?

303
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,012
I don't know.

304
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:02,851
Nice 'do, Dickie.

305
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:05,520
You look like Mount Pepto-Bismol
just erupted.

306
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:07,481
Pink is cosmic, all right?

307
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:09,816
For the last time, my name ain't Dickie.

308
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:12,819
It's lce Pick.
Would you people get that straight?

309
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,321
Ice Pick...

310
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:18,617
I love the creativity and imagination
that you've displayed here...

311
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:21,662
but no matter how outrageous
you act or you dress...

312
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:24,039
I'm not gonna fire you.
So give it a rest.

313
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:26,833
Love you, pal. Grab a mop.

314
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:30,629
He could use that pink one
he's got on his head.

315
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:39,096
Don't worry. He's just acting out.
We'll bring him around.

316
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,390
Can you tell me why
we're doing this again?

317
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,520
I promised Dan's brother we'd get him
through one job without getting canned.

318
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:49,356
I wish I could afford
a makeover like that.

319
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:54,069
These are the bills
that have to be paid this month...

320
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,946
but this baby...

321
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:57,781
is actually a check...

322
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:01,243
made out to your business
for 34 big ones.

323
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:03,495
Dollars, that is.

324
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:06,874
Why don't you collect
from some of these stiffs?

325
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:10,043
Their kids spend more time here
than they do at home.

326
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:13,672
One ring off Elena's finger,
you could run this place forever.

327
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:16,758
That being said, I'm resigning.
Effective immediately.

328
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:19,803
"Ice Pick". I like that,
but it's a little commonplace.

329
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:24,182
What about "Ice Pick the Great"
or "Saint Ice Pick"?

330
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:27,686
Or "The Great and Powerful
Wizard of lce Pick"?

331
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:29,938
Very funny.
Seven on a scale of a thousand.

332
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:31,982
Nose Pick, let me ask you a question.

333
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:35,652
Why cut new holes?
Why not close up some of the old ones...

334
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:37,446
like your mouth?

335
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:40,532
What is that, an old hippie joke?

336
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:43,452
Wrong answer.
Don't you kids try that at home.

337
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:46,747
Margo, don't pull
on Dickie's earring, okay? Grow up.

338
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:50,834
Ice Pick is right.
Auntie Elena should help.

339
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:53,086
You're not supposed
to call her "auntie".

340
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:55,047
- Just Elena.
- What's it matter?

341
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:57,174
They can't understand me.

342
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:59,593
He does so much good.
I wish we could help.

343
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:02,763
I tried. I gave him
that idea subliminally...

344
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:04,056
about a new wing.

345
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:05,807
What's that do?

346
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:09,603
Increase their disposable income
by a factor of four at least.

347
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:19,863
Honey! Honey.

348
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,407
Did you hear that?
Tell me you heard that.

349
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:24,493
Whit. He just said, clear as a bell...

350
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:26,787
"by a factor of four at least".

351
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:28,205
And I understood it.

352
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:30,666
This is so great.

353
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:33,627
It was in their language,
but that was the phrase.

354
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,963
Those were the words,
"by a factor of four".

355
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:37,923
Beats the hell out of "dada".

356
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,633
- You got it?
- Right here.

357
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:41,426
- He's got it.
- Let's see it.

358
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:43,804
Oh, boy, home movies.

359
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:47,808
He understood our language.

360
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,687
Is that all you have to say?

361
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:53,480
Okay. Let me think.

362
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,150
He's going to want us to explain
the secrets of the universe.

363
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:59,403
That could be a real problem.

364
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:04,992
Well, you're in trouble
again, Sylvester.

365
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:15,836
Now go to sleep,
or it's Valium for you, pal.

366
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,171
There you are. You got that lock?

367
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:20,549
I've got the security bonder.

368
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,093
Yeah, right. Okay, Sly man...

369
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:25,429
I've got that surprise I promised.

370
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:27,723
Let's see you get out
of this one, Houdini.

371
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:30,517
Dumb and Dumber.

372
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,185
Lock and load.

373
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:38,919
Say "cheese".

374
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:40,796
Cheese!

375
00:23:43,382 --> 00:23:46,176
We're currently experiencing
technical difficulties.

376
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,471
What the hell?

377
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:53,559
It's too easy.

378
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,021
What do you got?

379
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:00,816
A temporary loss of transmission
in Quadrant 4.

380
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:06,029
Lexi?

381
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,118
You're out.

382
00:24:11,577 --> 00:24:12,911
Come with me.

383
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:15,289
I want to, but I'm too scared.

384
00:24:15,664 --> 00:24:17,249
I'll take you to a mall.

385
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:18,625
A mall?

386
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:20,377
Really?

387
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:23,881
I can't.

388
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:26,967
Wait a minute.

389
00:24:27,843 --> 00:24:29,970
I heard something. You better go.

390
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:32,806
Bye.

391
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:36,101
Take care of yourself.

392
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:38,103
I'll miss you.

393
00:24:47,446 --> 00:24:49,198
Quadrant 2's down now.

394
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,701
Don't be late, babe.

395
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:55,662
Five, four, three...

396
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:58,123
two, one.

397
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:03,420
Diaper Express. Right on time.

398
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,313
Diaper gravy.

399
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:26,902
Well, give me liberty or give me death.

400
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:33,200
Not exactly aromatherapy.

401
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:38,914
I should've taken death.

402
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:46,296
Yeah, well, there it is
in plain English.

403
00:25:48,257 --> 00:25:52,970
It sounds like baby talk, but he's
saying, "by a factor of four at least".

404
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,471
How can you tell?

405
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:59,142
It's like this language that I used to
speak, and I've just forgotten it...

406
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:00,852
except for once in a while.

407
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:03,063
I believe you, honey. Really, I do.

408
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:04,690
Can I go home now?

409
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:06,984
Yeah, but remember one thing, Nosebleed.

410
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:09,319
Dennis Rodman can afford
to look like roadkill.

411
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:11,738
He gets 18 rebounds a game.

412
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:21,623
Sweet dreams, robo-entertainers.
I don't wanna hear any snoring.

413
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:22,916
How were the crowds?

414
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:26,879
20,000 maniacs disguised as kids.
How do you think they were?

415
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:30,215
We had some glitches with Bunting.
Bring up his schematic.

416
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:31,842
Coming up.

417
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:36,805
The world's biggest video game.

418
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:40,350
The tracking software
needs to be recompiled.

419
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:43,020
If you don't have any dirty diapers...

420
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:44,730
Dive, dive!

421
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,774
- Come on. I'm looking bad.
- He tries so hard.

422
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:52,070
I hope when I go over and speak their
language, I'll remember to thank him.

423
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:53,739
How could you thank him?

424
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:58,368
When you cross over, you won't remember
anything you know now.

425
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:01,622
Wait a minute. I got a great idea.

426
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:04,499
Have you said "dada" or "mama" yet?

427
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:07,336
No, that's so stupid. I've decided...

428
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:11,924
the first time I speak, I'm gonna
quote the Gettysburg Address. Flat out.

429
00:27:15,636 --> 00:27:19,139
No, you gotta say "dada".
Say it. He'll go nuts!

430
00:27:19,765 --> 00:27:22,142
He'll call Mom and they'll both go nuts.

431
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:23,602
I don't know.

432
00:27:23,894 --> 00:27:26,104
You gotta say it. Come on, do it.

433
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:30,067
I'll do it.

434
00:27:33,654 --> 00:27:35,239
Dada!

435
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:45,165
You said "dada".

436
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:50,254
She said "dada"! I got it on video.

437
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:52,464
I can't believe it! I missed it!

438
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:55,509
- Where is she?
- Come on, girl. Where is she?

439
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:58,011
My little sweetie.

440
00:27:58,262 --> 00:27:59,346
My little doll.

441
00:27:59,638 --> 00:28:01,223
- Told you.
- Say "dada".

442
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:04,268
- Can you say "mama"?
- Watch this. Mama!

443
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:06,311
She said it!

444
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:08,814
She did, she did.

445
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:18,073
What are you feeding those kids anyway?

446
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:19,491
Too much.

447
00:28:21,243 --> 00:28:23,120
- Happy trails.
- Okay, take care.

448
00:28:30,168 --> 00:28:31,712
Diaper gravy.

449
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:44,141
This is awesome!

450
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:49,229
Where are the chicks?

451
00:29:08,832 --> 00:29:10,876
Hasta la vista, baby.

452
00:29:25,224 --> 00:29:27,309
All right! Look out, world.

453
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:28,602
Sly man's here!

454
00:29:32,648 --> 00:29:36,151
The night is young. And so am I.

455
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:43,450
Diaper gravy.

456
00:29:50,707 --> 00:29:52,543
Having that strange feeling again?

457
00:29:52,793 --> 00:29:54,920
Yeah. Like somebody's calling me.

458
00:30:02,219 --> 00:30:05,013
It sure happens a lot.
What are they saying?

459
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:08,100
I don't know. But it sure is scary.

460
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,387
Whose little boy are you?

461
00:30:48,307 --> 00:30:50,767
- Whit, what's wrong?
- What is it, sweetie?

462
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:52,060
Hey, come here.

463
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,479
Did something scare you?

464
00:30:54,897 --> 00:30:55,981
Come on.

465
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:02,070
- Let's take you upstairs.
- It's almost bedtime. Let's go.

466
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:05,282
Down to the last
cleaning person, you have passed...

467
00:31:05,616 --> 00:31:08,577
the most stringent
security check ever devised!

468
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:10,871
You each receive salaries 10 times...

469
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:14,333
that of similar positions
in other companies.

470
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:15,667
Why?

471
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:18,587
You are part of the most
momentous experiment...

472
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:22,424
in the history of corporate
research and development!

473
00:31:23,008 --> 00:31:24,176
You are entrusted...

474
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:25,761
with that knowledge...

475
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:29,765
and the responsibility
that goes with it.

476
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:32,893
And you have failed that responsibility.

477
00:31:34,102 --> 00:31:37,022
Now I don't care how, or what you do.

478
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:39,858
Get Sylvester back.

479
00:31:40,192 --> 00:31:43,612
Yes, sir, you're someone's
little boy, all right.

480
00:31:43,904 --> 00:31:48,075
And there's going to be a reward,
and I'm going to be the rewardee.

481
00:31:48,325 --> 00:31:51,119
I'm going to take real good care of you.

482
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,997
Reward? Hell, forget reward.

483
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:57,543
Let's talk ransom.
Yeah, that's what we'll do.

484
00:31:58,126 --> 00:32:00,087
Ransom and easy street.

485
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:02,589
And if they don't come through...

486
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:05,133
Well, let's not think about that.

487
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:07,302
Looking good.

488
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:19,481
Come back when you're ready
to play in the bigs.

489
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,527
I gotta get a disguise.

490
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:36,290
Good evening.

491
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:39,418
Good evening.

492
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:42,504
What? This is a fashion statement.

493
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:43,589
You see that?

494
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:45,757
It looked like a kid.

495
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:47,551
That's a baby.

496
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,721
This disguise sucks.

497
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:53,056
Taxi!

498
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:08,280
Hey, babe.

499
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,364
Where are we going?

500
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:13,076
Since I can't walk, I guess we're
going wherever my mother's going.

501
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:14,536
Is that friendly?

502
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:17,331
What does this look like?
The welcome wagon?

503
00:33:17,581 --> 00:33:18,749
Look, I got a problem.

504
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:20,125
Take off your clothes.

505
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:23,378
Okay, but at least you could
take me to dinner first.

506
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:25,172
Oy, a comedian.

507
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:26,256
Yikes!

508
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:58,830
Who designed this dress?
Larry, Moe and Curly?

509
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:02,209
Call me.

510
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:05,837
Oh, no. It's Elena's goons.

511
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:09,633
Don't forget, I'm listed.

512
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:15,722
Merry Christmas, Morty.
See you tomorrow.

513
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:17,140
Good night, boss.

514
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:22,646
Sure glad she wasn't wearing heels.

515
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:28,026
One umbrella one Two umbrella two.

516
00:34:28,277 --> 00:34:31,071
- Let's go upstairs to the zoo.
- Good night, Amanda.

517
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:33,699
Good night, Rachel.

518
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:35,158
Sweet dreams.

519
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,872
That was beautiful.

520
00:34:40,622 --> 00:34:41,790
Sleep tight, you guys.

521
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:44,793
Yeah, there we go.

522
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:47,421
We'll watch them till you come up.

523
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:50,924
- Why don't we have another?
- What?

524
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:52,301
Baby.

525
00:34:52,593 --> 00:34:53,927
I tell you what.

526
00:34:54,303 --> 00:34:57,806
You carry it for 41 l2 months and
I'll carry it for 41 l2 months.

527
00:34:58,098 --> 00:35:00,183
Deal. Let's start now.

528
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:01,768
Honey...

529
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,439
Honey, we adopted Whit...

530
00:35:05,647 --> 00:35:09,234
because we thought that we
couldn't have children of our own.

531
00:35:09,526 --> 00:35:12,696
And then we had Carrie.
She was our little miracle baby.

532
00:35:12,946 --> 00:35:14,781
And miracles can re-occur.

533
00:35:15,032 --> 00:35:17,910
Well, let's not talk
about that right now, okay?

534
00:35:18,368 --> 00:35:19,703
Maybe next year.

535
00:35:19,953 --> 00:35:21,538
Now, sweetheart...

536
00:35:21,997 --> 00:35:25,042
love of my life,
father of my children.

537
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:30,214
Did you tell Mr. Wilson
that we wanted a $50,000 loan...

538
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:31,715
for a new wing?

539
00:35:31,965 --> 00:35:33,217
Oh, yeah, that.

540
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:34,635
Oh, yeah, that.

541
00:35:34,843 --> 00:35:37,971
- I meant to show you something.
- We're behind on the mortgage.

542
00:35:38,222 --> 00:35:40,057
We have to go to the bank and beg.

543
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:42,476
I just want you to look at some numbers.

544
00:35:42,726 --> 00:35:46,730
Right now we get $300 a month for each
baby in the research program, right?

545
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,441
Right. If we take in 10 more babies...

546
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:53,737
we qualify as a Chapter 40
research corporation...

547
00:35:53,987 --> 00:35:55,781
and then we get $900 a baby.

548
00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:57,366
Nine hundred?

549
00:35:57,616 --> 00:35:58,617
So...

550
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:00,744
the 10 new babies, our six...

551
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:04,957
that's 14,400 a month,
2,000 a month for the loan.

552
00:36:05,207 --> 00:36:08,252
Even with more help,
we'll still operate above break-even.

553
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,754
We can do more research,
take in more babies...

554
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,381
lose less money.

555
00:36:12,673 --> 00:36:15,509
This is amazing.
This actually makes sense.

556
00:36:16,552 --> 00:36:17,636
Wait a minute.

557
00:36:17,928 --> 00:36:21,515
You don't have a single cell in your
entire brain devoted to business.

558
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:23,141
How did you come up with this?

559
00:36:25,102 --> 00:36:27,312
Actually, I don't think I did.

560
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:29,356
I think it was...

561
00:36:29,606 --> 00:36:30,440
Whit.

562
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:33,277
Whit told you this business plan?

563
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:37,781
Well, not tell exactly.
It was just... It came to me.

564
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:40,325
When I was working with him,
it kind of...

565
00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:43,704
jumped out of his brain
and landed in mine.

566
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:46,123
I went to the pamphlets. It works.

567
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:49,459
Kid knows his business.

568
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:52,462
Got some better news.

569
00:36:53,672 --> 00:36:54,673
What?

570
00:36:54,882 --> 00:36:58,302
'Twas the night before Christmas,
and all through the house...

571
00:36:58,552 --> 00:37:01,972
not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse.

572
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:03,140
Or a kid.

573
00:37:03,432 --> 00:37:05,559
Or a toddler.

574
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:22,242
Okay, Charlie, they're all out
for the night. Lock it up.

575
00:37:24,578 --> 00:37:26,580
Sly's in the house!

576
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,207
King of the mall!

577
00:37:28,832 --> 00:37:29,666
Macy's.

578
00:37:30,709 --> 00:37:32,920
Damn! I didn't bring
my credit cards.

579
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,381
Shop till you drop.

580
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:46,225
Video games. My kingdom
for some video games.

581
00:37:49,728 --> 00:37:51,104
What have I got?

582
00:38:03,116 --> 00:38:04,034
Baby Guess.

583
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:05,994
I can get out of drag.

584
00:38:14,169 --> 00:38:15,337
Smoking!

585
00:38:27,558 --> 00:38:29,226
He shoots. He scores!

586
00:39:24,615 --> 00:39:27,826
- World Facts for 800, please.
- Answer.. Daily Double.

587
00:39:28,577 --> 00:39:29,828
You're close to the lead.

588
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:33,624
Donna moved ahead a while ago,
but you're just $100 away.

589
00:39:33,874 --> 00:39:35,250
I'll wager 1,100, please.

590
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,462
For a $1,000 lead,
here's the clue in World Facts.

591
00:39:38,712 --> 00:39:43,008
"Discovered by David Livingstone,
Botswana's Lake Ngami...

592
00:39:43,217 --> 00:39:45,969
lies in the northern part
of this desert".

593
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,304
What is the Kalahari?

594
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:49,014
What is the Gobi?

595
00:39:49,348 --> 00:39:50,974
No. Wrong part of the world.

596
00:39:51,225 --> 00:39:52,768
What is the Kalahari?

597
00:39:52,976 --> 00:39:55,854
All right, that takes you
to 4,800. Pick again.

598
00:39:58,106 --> 00:39:59,691
Do you think we've lived before?

599
00:39:59,942 --> 00:40:02,152
I don't know, honey. That's your area.

600
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:05,656
The Tibetans believe that
when we're born again...

601
00:40:05,906 --> 00:40:08,951
we retain universal knowledge
for the first two years.

602
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:11,954
Then we learn to talk
and we forget it all.

603
00:40:12,204 --> 00:40:13,580
They call it "crossing over".

604
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:16,750
I'm doing a crossword here.
Universal knowledge can wait.

605
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,168
No, just think.

606
00:40:19,294 --> 00:40:22,548
What if our babies
have all the answers to life?

607
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:26,843
I'd settle for 28 across. What was it
that Miss Muffet sat on again?

608
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:28,554
Her tuffet.

609
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,015
What the hell is a tuffet anyway?

610
00:40:32,558 --> 00:40:33,809
You got me.

611
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:38,647
When you tap into universal knowledge,
you find out and let me know.

612
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:49,408
Lexi, you should've been here, kid.

613
00:41:17,436 --> 00:41:20,355
What? You never heard
of Weight Watchers?

614
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:22,232
Diaper rodeo!

615
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,152
On your mark. Get set. Go!

616
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:36,622
- Here goes Old Faithful.
- Sprang a leak!

617
00:41:36,955 --> 00:41:38,332
Come here, sweetie.

618
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:42,878
- A winner.
- Time!

619
00:41:43,545 --> 00:41:46,089
Rotator cuff, rotator cuff injury.

620
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:08,570
May the wrath of Shiva descend upon you.

621
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,198
Stick to your rapping, Ice Shtick...

622
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:14,743
and leave the wisecracks
to the people with IQs over 40.

623
00:42:15,285 --> 00:42:17,329
It's not rap. It's mantra.

624
00:42:17,663 --> 00:42:21,416
Junior, I was chanting mantras
before you were born.

625
00:42:23,418 --> 00:42:26,547
You were chanting mantras
before Buddha was born.

626
00:42:27,297 --> 00:42:28,465
Pretty...

627
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:30,342
That's pretty good.

628
00:42:30,926 --> 00:42:32,636
Christmas shopping. Pray for me.

629
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:34,513
Want me to take the kids?

630
00:42:34,763 --> 00:42:37,432
You can leave Carrie.
I'm going to run some stats.

631
00:42:37,683 --> 00:42:38,850
Okay, come here.

632
00:42:43,772 --> 00:42:45,566
You're going to love it.

633
00:42:45,941 --> 00:42:48,819
That's a car. You can't
have a car for Christmas.

634
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:53,115
It's a little too expensive. Well,
maybe a little dinky car would be good.

635
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:11,592
What the hell was that?
I think I just had a kid.

636
00:43:29,776 --> 00:43:31,570
Babyco 1, he's been spotted.

637
00:43:31,904 --> 00:43:33,447
He's heading your way.

638
00:43:36,533 --> 00:43:37,868
Busted.

639
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:02,267
Right up to the tunnel.

640
00:44:02,517 --> 00:44:03,352
Go on.

641
00:44:16,573 --> 00:44:17,407
We're on him.

642
00:44:32,673 --> 00:44:34,132
Hey, buddy.

643
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,097
Come on, kid.

644
00:44:40,305 --> 00:44:41,640
Give it up.

645
00:44:48,814 --> 00:44:51,024
I hope you got a kick out of that.

646
00:45:15,424 --> 00:45:16,758
Whittie, you there?

647
00:45:19,011 --> 00:45:20,345
Over here.

648
00:45:22,514 --> 00:45:23,891
Sweetie?

649
00:45:24,474 --> 00:45:26,101
You still in there?

650
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:27,978
Where'd he go?

651
00:45:39,823 --> 00:45:42,117
What was that scream? Was that you?

652
00:45:42,784 --> 00:45:44,745
Sweetie, what are you looking at?

653
00:45:47,164 --> 00:45:50,167
I thought we dressed you in overalls.
That's strange.

654
00:45:52,377 --> 00:45:53,837
My little sugar.

655
00:45:54,546 --> 00:45:55,964
Were you scared again?

656
00:45:56,215 --> 00:46:00,636
Come on. I know what's gonna
cheer you up. Mommy knows.

657
00:46:19,196 --> 00:46:20,447
Tears?

658
00:46:20,822 --> 00:46:24,159
Could this be guilt
for threatening our great work?

659
00:46:27,162 --> 00:46:28,080
Put him down.

660
00:46:32,417 --> 00:46:33,961
I want you to see this boy...

661
00:46:34,169 --> 00:46:37,673
who has jeopardized
everything we've worked for.

662
00:46:40,551 --> 00:46:41,802
Serves him right.

663
00:46:42,052 --> 00:46:46,306
Why don't you go talk to your computers,
Basil? They understand you.

664
00:46:46,515 --> 00:46:47,891
They don't like him either.

665
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,394
All right, Sylvester, go to your room.

666
00:46:50,644 --> 00:46:52,271
We'll settle this later.

667
00:46:54,898 --> 00:46:58,318
For heaven's sakes,
someone get him out of my sight!

668
00:47:13,792 --> 00:47:17,546
I've never seen him like this before.
Go run some of that off, honey.

669
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,214
Watch out for that rope.

670
00:47:19,464 --> 00:47:23,927
You know, I gave him a couple of slurps
of my ice cream and he just went nuts.

671
00:47:26,847 --> 00:47:28,015
Dan, come out here.

672
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:36,231
I don't know what you feed him,
but where can I get some?

673
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:40,485
How does he do that?

674
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:48,285
Sugar high. You should've seen him
at Baskin-Robbins.

675
00:47:48,535 --> 00:47:50,495
We've been banned for life.

676
00:47:56,919 --> 00:47:58,879
Well, he seems okay.

677
00:48:00,047 --> 00:48:01,798
I'll have a talk with him.

678
00:48:15,187 --> 00:48:17,272
What is wrong with you?

679
00:48:17,814 --> 00:48:20,776
I'm the executive director
of a madhouse.

680
00:48:30,327 --> 00:48:31,578
What's wrong?

681
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:40,462
Nothing ever scares Sly.

682
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:43,840
I just want him to stop crying.

683
00:48:47,844 --> 00:48:49,972
She's still upset, honey.

684
00:48:50,264 --> 00:48:53,058
It's all right.
Just go to sleep, Carrie.

685
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,227
You'll be all right.

686
00:48:55,602 --> 00:48:58,063
- There we are.
- Okay, you sleep tight.

687
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:04,862
First Whit, and now Carrie.
Must be contagious.

688
00:49:07,948 --> 00:49:09,491
Night, guys.

689
00:49:11,326 --> 00:49:13,453
Had any of those weird feelings lately?

690
00:49:13,704 --> 00:49:15,289
- What?
- You heard me.

691
00:49:15,539 --> 00:49:17,332
Lighten up, will you?

692
00:49:17,541 --> 00:49:18,709
You're not my brother.

693
00:49:18,959 --> 00:49:21,420
You fooled my mom and dad,
but you don't fool me.

694
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:22,754
What do you mean?

695
00:49:23,422 --> 00:49:25,632
- You're not my brother.
- Don't be dumb.

696
00:49:29,386 --> 00:49:30,470
Jerk.

697
00:49:31,054 --> 00:49:32,431
She's gonna be trouble.

698
00:49:43,025 --> 00:49:45,152
Play. I'll be watching you.

699
00:49:47,196 --> 00:49:49,114
Want to swing? I'll push you.

700
00:49:50,365 --> 00:49:51,533
I don't want to.

701
00:49:52,075 --> 00:49:53,619
Tell us what happened.

702
00:49:54,661 --> 00:49:57,331
I was at the playground with my mom...

703
00:49:57,581 --> 00:49:58,582
With your what?

704
00:49:58,832 --> 00:50:00,334
He's delusional.

705
00:50:00,542 --> 00:50:02,669
You're such a putz, Basil.

706
00:50:03,045 --> 00:50:03,879
Ignore him.

707
00:50:04,213 --> 00:50:05,380
Go on.

708
00:50:05,797 --> 00:50:09,968
And I climbed up the slide
and I bumped into this other kid...

709
00:50:10,344 --> 00:50:12,888
and when I got up, it was me.

710
00:50:13,347 --> 00:50:15,015
What do you mean, it was you?

711
00:50:15,807 --> 00:50:18,810
The other boy. He looked just like me.

712
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:21,355
What's your name?

713
00:50:21,897 --> 00:50:23,440
Whit.

714
00:50:23,732 --> 00:50:24,900
Oh, boy.

715
00:50:32,366 --> 00:50:35,035
Don't worry, Whit.
It'll be all right.

716
00:50:35,285 --> 00:50:37,955
Dr Kinder will take you
back to your mother.

717
00:50:38,288 --> 00:50:39,998
She'll do no such thing.

718
00:50:40,207 --> 00:50:41,291
Don't you see?

719
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,878
Dr Kinder arranged
for the Bobbins to adopt Whit...

720
00:50:45,128 --> 00:50:46,547
for just this purpose.

721
00:50:46,797 --> 00:50:49,424
A twin progressive,
comparative experimentation.

722
00:50:49,925 --> 00:50:51,468
What's he talking about?

723
00:50:51,802 --> 00:50:54,179
We don't know, and we're geniuses.

724
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:57,391
It means Dr Kinder
let that quack, Bobbins...

725
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,143
raise Whit while
she raised Sylvester...

726
00:51:00,477 --> 00:51:03,647
to demonstrate the superiority...

727
00:51:04,481 --> 00:51:05,816
of the Kinder method.

728
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:09,403
And wait till she finds out
the twins have been switched.

729
00:51:09,736 --> 00:51:14,700
She'll realize she has an opportunity
for a living cross-evaluation.

730
00:51:15,284 --> 00:51:16,201
He's at it again.

731
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,913
Obviously Sly, swine though he is...

732
00:51:20,122 --> 00:51:22,332
is superior to this Whit individual.

733
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,084
Gee, thanks.

734
00:51:24,626 --> 00:51:26,712
- She wouldn't do that.
- Do what?

735
00:51:26,962 --> 00:51:30,549
Keep a child from its mother
just to prove her theory.

736
00:51:30,841 --> 00:51:32,509
Oh, really?

737
00:51:34,511 --> 00:51:36,388
Get Dr Kinder down here.

738
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:38,932
Tell me, who is this?

739
00:51:39,183 --> 00:51:42,186
That's Sylvester.
His brain synapses fire at a rate...

740
00:51:42,394 --> 00:51:44,204
of about 40bondekbondek1bondek2
above normal.

741
00:51:44,354 --> 00:51:46,481
So that's Sly, right?

742
00:51:47,816 --> 00:51:48,734
Look at this...

743
00:51:48,942 --> 00:51:50,527
little person's voiceprint.

744
00:51:51,653 --> 00:51:52,487
So?

745
00:51:53,447 --> 00:51:57,284
Compare it to this voiceprint
taken from Sly last week.

746
00:51:58,619 --> 00:51:59,870
Oh, my God!

747
00:52:01,121 --> 00:52:02,456
Oh, my God, no.

748
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:07,461
Those imbeciles!

749
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:14,468
Sly?

750
00:52:17,638 --> 00:52:18,889
Whit?

751
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:23,644
You idiots!

752
00:52:25,062 --> 00:52:26,396
You imbeciles!

753
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:27,648
You morons!

754
00:52:27,981 --> 00:52:30,108
- You cretins! You, you...
- Boring.

755
00:52:31,235 --> 00:52:32,569
Traitors.

756
00:52:35,948 --> 00:52:37,032
No, not...

757
00:52:37,282 --> 00:52:38,534
idiots, no.

758
00:52:41,078 --> 00:52:42,621
You wonderful...

759
00:52:43,247 --> 00:52:45,374
brilliant assemblage.

760
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:50,045
You have given me the greatest gift
of my entire life...

761
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:53,423
our own living cross-evaluation!

762
00:52:54,216 --> 00:52:55,384
Told you.

763
00:52:56,009 --> 00:52:56,843
Brown nose.

764
00:52:59,054 --> 00:53:00,305
Give them all a raise.

765
00:53:00,597 --> 00:53:01,682
Brilliant.

766
00:53:01,974 --> 00:53:03,725
I feel so warm and motherly.

767
00:53:04,226 --> 00:53:06,353
I think I'll go visit my darling niece.

768
00:53:06,645 --> 00:53:08,188
And the mother of the year is...

769
00:53:09,481 --> 00:53:11,692
Start the comparative tests on Whit.

770
00:53:11,942 --> 00:53:14,736
We'll see how Sylvester's
doing among the peasants.

771
00:53:14,987 --> 00:53:16,655
How can she do this?

772
00:53:17,072 --> 00:53:17,990
Don't you understand?

773
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,701
Dr Kinder is acting
for the greater good.

774
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:24,204
Maybe it's all right for us,
but Whit has a mom and dad.

775
00:53:24,413 --> 00:53:25,581
What's wrong with you?

776
00:53:26,248 --> 00:53:28,458
She's not going to keep Whit forever.

777
00:53:30,711 --> 00:53:31,712
Yeah, sure, Basil.

778
00:53:32,379 --> 00:53:34,756
This is Dr Kinder
we're talking about...

779
00:53:35,424 --> 00:53:37,467
not Dr Frankenstein.

780
00:53:42,347 --> 00:53:43,348
Teddie, what is it?

781
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:45,601
I feel funny.

782
00:53:46,643 --> 00:53:48,020
What's wrong?

783
00:53:48,979 --> 00:53:50,314
She's crossing over.

784
00:53:50,522 --> 00:53:52,441
She's going to be one
of the grownups now.

785
00:53:52,774 --> 00:53:55,402
Don't worry. This is the way
it's supposed to be.

786
00:53:55,652 --> 00:53:57,196
You'll all cross over soon.

787
00:53:57,779 --> 00:53:58,947
Bye.

788
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:00,991
Don't go, Teddie.

789
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,910
My God, look at that.

790
00:54:03,118 --> 00:54:05,996
Two years old and the limbic activity
is slowing down.

791
00:54:06,246 --> 00:54:09,583
The frontal lobes are taking over.
We were right.

792
00:54:10,209 --> 00:54:11,835
Will she remember us?

793
00:54:13,212 --> 00:54:15,172
No, she's one of them now.

794
00:54:15,714 --> 00:54:17,591
Dan, we can't be late.

795
00:54:17,841 --> 00:54:20,969
They're late. They're late
for a very important date.

796
00:54:21,178 --> 00:54:25,015
Your mom and dad are off trying
to save the farm. Hip, hip, hooray!

797
00:54:25,265 --> 00:54:27,643
Oh, you sweethearts. Thank you.

798
00:54:27,935 --> 00:54:29,770
Thanks, all of you.

799
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,522
Here, you take her.

800
00:54:31,772 --> 00:54:33,440
My little angel.

801
00:54:34,483 --> 00:54:35,484
Who's there?

802
00:54:35,734 --> 00:54:36,568
Let's go see.

803
00:54:41,198 --> 00:54:44,785
Come on. I'll make you breakfast.
Pancakes in the shape of a witch.

804
00:54:45,035 --> 00:54:48,413
Still getting your help
from the work-release program, I see.

805
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:54,169
Give Dr Kinder a nice big kiss.

806
00:54:59,174 --> 00:55:00,592
Very nice.

807
00:55:03,804 --> 00:55:05,722
I love coming to this house.

808
00:55:06,223 --> 00:55:08,892
There's just something
about it that's so...

809
00:55:11,645 --> 00:55:12,563
homey.

810
00:55:12,813 --> 00:55:15,440
- We were just going out.
- You were going out?

811
00:55:17,317 --> 00:55:20,445
Tell me, how is Whit?
Is he talking yet?

812
00:55:20,654 --> 00:55:24,825
Actually, two days ago we had
some communication in pre-language talk.

813
00:55:25,409 --> 00:55:26,410
Really?

814
00:55:27,077 --> 00:55:28,537
We caught it on video.

815
00:55:28,745 --> 00:55:30,122
On video?

816
00:55:31,123 --> 00:55:33,333
I've translated several whole sentences.

817
00:55:35,377 --> 00:55:36,879
Whole sentences?

818
00:55:37,713 --> 00:55:39,089
I have a wonderful idea.

819
00:55:39,548 --> 00:55:42,301
Why don't we take Whit to the lab?
With your gift...

820
00:55:42,509 --> 00:55:44,261
for pre-language...

821
00:55:44,469 --> 00:55:47,890
and our technology,
I'm sure we can skip a step or two.

822
00:55:49,016 --> 00:55:49,850
What?

823
00:55:55,981 --> 00:55:57,566
Slow down, pal. What?

824
00:55:58,025 --> 00:55:59,026
Don't do it.

825
00:56:00,903 --> 00:56:02,821
What? What'd he say?

826
00:56:03,488 --> 00:56:04,573
"Don't do it".

827
00:56:05,157 --> 00:56:06,241
That's ridiculous.

828
00:56:06,533 --> 00:56:07,784
What are you saying?

829
00:56:08,035 --> 00:56:09,411
They've got Whit.

830
00:56:10,454 --> 00:56:12,039
Wait a minute.

831
00:56:12,247 --> 00:56:14,625
Who's got Whit? You're Whit.

832
00:56:16,084 --> 00:56:18,545
- Go on.
- Can't.

833
00:56:19,463 --> 00:56:20,714
That's all I'm getting.

834
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,258
Isn't that amazing?

835
00:56:24,051 --> 00:56:27,638
I must be running along. I have
some serious, important matters...

836
00:56:28,263 --> 00:56:31,016
that I have to attend to.
Goodbye, Whit.

837
00:56:37,773 --> 00:56:40,317
Hives. She's up to something.

838
00:56:40,734 --> 00:56:43,654
- What is going on with you today?
- We got to go.

839
00:56:43,987 --> 00:56:46,073
You okay, sweetie?
You look a little sad.

840
00:56:46,281 --> 00:56:47,449
We do have to go.

841
00:56:48,242 --> 00:56:50,202
Carrie, go back with the babies.

842
00:56:53,705 --> 00:56:56,166
Get me Dr Heep
on the phone immediately.

843
00:56:56,416 --> 00:56:59,586
I don't care what he's doing.
Get him on the phone now!

844
00:57:01,964 --> 00:57:05,217
Jonathan, I want two of our best men
sent down here now.

845
00:57:05,467 --> 00:57:07,511
No! You idiot. No, listen to me.

846
00:57:07,761 --> 00:57:10,222
Dan is beginning to understand
both of them.

847
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:12,516
And if he does, then we go to prison.

848
00:57:12,766 --> 00:57:14,977
We have to have them both.
We can't switch them.

849
00:57:16,186 --> 00:57:18,856
I want you to rest here
a little minute, okay?

850
00:57:20,274 --> 00:57:22,276
Here we go. There you go.

851
00:57:50,762 --> 00:57:52,431
Margo will be right back.

852
00:57:53,932 --> 00:57:56,059
Keep an eye on that boy now.

853
00:57:59,646 --> 00:58:01,398
You want to tell us about it?

854
00:58:01,648 --> 00:58:02,900
Yeah, I guess so.

855
00:58:03,734 --> 00:58:04,568
What now?

856
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:06,403
You have to ask? It's the power.

857
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:09,781
If this house was a dog,
we'd have it put to sleep.

858
00:58:15,954 --> 00:58:20,250
Well, would you look at that.
The sun is setting in that boy's pants.

859
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,835
He wishes.

860
00:58:23,962 --> 00:58:25,714
Nice work there, Dickie.

861
00:58:26,256 --> 00:58:27,257
Real classy.

862
00:58:27,549 --> 00:58:28,550
So I'm fired, right?

863
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:32,304
Fat chance. Change your shirt
and check on the babies.

864
00:58:36,642 --> 00:58:38,685
A lot of Van Gogh in that kid.

865
00:58:38,977 --> 00:58:40,437
His ear is still intact.

866
00:58:40,687 --> 00:58:42,981
- You're weird.
- Check on the power.

867
00:58:44,149 --> 00:58:46,443
You just let them take your brother?

868
00:58:46,735 --> 00:58:49,279
- It didn't even bother you?
- It bothered me.

869
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:53,283
There just wasn't anything
I could do to help him.

870
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:05,254
We're tracing the power outage,
and this property may be the source.

871
00:59:05,504 --> 00:59:08,840
- What can we do to help?
- We need access to your hookup.

872
00:59:09,675 --> 00:59:12,553
Ray, why don't you check the basement?
I'll look upstairs.

873
00:59:12,803 --> 00:59:14,513
What's going on? Who is that?

874
00:59:14,763 --> 00:59:16,849
It's Elena's goons. They're after me.

875
00:59:17,057 --> 00:59:18,308
Into the bedroom. Hurry up.

876
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:19,893
What's a goon?

877
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:22,813
So how long have you been
into self-mutilation?

878
00:59:23,105 --> 00:59:24,189
We all need a hobby.

879
00:59:24,439 --> 00:59:26,358
How many bedrooms on this floor?

880
00:59:26,608 --> 00:59:27,985
- Four.
- And on the third floor?

881
00:59:28,235 --> 00:59:29,069
Five.

882
00:59:29,278 --> 00:59:32,865
I want you to go down, get my partner
and tell him I need a hand.

883
00:59:33,156 --> 00:59:34,783
Keep an eye on the babies.

884
00:59:35,033 --> 00:59:35,951
My pleasure.

885
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:40,789
Brilliant, Dickie. Why didn't you
just stuff me in a suitcase for him?

886
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:42,291
Close the door.

887
01:00:25,417 --> 01:00:27,169
You must be Sylvester.

888
01:00:27,419 --> 01:00:29,713
I heard about you and your karate.

889
01:00:29,963 --> 01:00:31,465
I'm a black belt.

890
01:00:31,882 --> 01:00:32,966
Care to try me, son?

891
01:00:35,385 --> 01:00:37,471
I'd be too scared.

892
01:00:42,392 --> 01:00:45,187
Now, I guess you expect me
to step over this ski...

893
01:00:45,437 --> 01:00:49,024
and you'll jump on the end,
and the end will hit me in the gonads.

894
01:00:49,233 --> 01:00:52,444
I'll scream and fall down the stairs.
Is that right?

895
01:00:54,863 --> 01:00:57,991
I think you've been seeing
too many bad movies, pal.

896
01:00:58,242 --> 01:01:00,953
Because I'm just going
to step around the ski.

897
01:01:01,995 --> 01:01:04,289
Just how stupid do you think I am?

898
01:01:09,002 --> 01:01:10,712
Pretty stupid.

899
01:01:15,133 --> 01:01:17,344
Gee, I bet that felt good.

900
01:01:27,396 --> 01:01:28,313
What happened?

901
01:01:28,897 --> 01:01:31,608
Sly kicked him right
in the forbidden zone.

902
01:01:40,325 --> 01:01:41,326
What's going on?

903
01:01:41,618 --> 01:01:45,122
A work-related injury.
I better go up and see what happened.

904
01:01:56,758 --> 01:01:57,759
Tough guy, eh?

905
01:01:59,177 --> 01:02:00,179
Well...

906
01:02:00,387 --> 01:02:02,598
you're about to meet
your worst nightmare.

907
01:02:02,848 --> 01:02:05,142
Goon, that is some lame dialogue.

908
01:02:09,062 --> 01:02:11,607
You really think I'm gonna
walk over that ski...

909
01:02:11,857 --> 01:02:13,650
and you're gonna jump...

910
01:02:13,901 --> 01:02:16,361
and that ski's gonna
hit me in the gonads...

911
01:02:16,653 --> 01:02:20,032
and I'm gonna scream
and make a funny face and fall?

912
01:02:20,657 --> 01:02:21,491
I don't think so.

913
01:02:25,787 --> 01:02:27,289
Cross your legs and smile.

914
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:48,644
You don't mess with the Sly man.

915
01:02:54,316 --> 01:02:56,443
Driver! Babyco, right away.

916
01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:01,990
Jonathan, I want the laboratory
stripped. Disappear. Understand?

917
01:03:02,282 --> 01:03:03,617
I want bare walls.

918
01:03:08,121 --> 01:03:11,792
You told me before that Whit
used to get weird feelings.

919
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,835
Like someone was calling him.

920
01:03:14,086 --> 01:03:15,879
I think that was me.

921
01:03:18,423 --> 01:03:20,801
All right, sit on the floor in a circle.

922
01:03:21,051 --> 01:03:23,011
Sit on the floor? In a circle?

923
01:03:23,262 --> 01:03:25,097
What part don't you understand?

924
01:03:25,305 --> 01:03:28,350
Bare walls! I want this place
stripped in three hours.

925
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,310
Suppose he does break through?

926
01:03:30,519 --> 01:03:32,646
Nobody will be able
to understand Sylvester.

927
01:03:32,938 --> 01:03:34,189
Who'll believe Bobbins?

928
01:03:34,439 --> 01:03:38,694
All he has to do is take Sylvester to
the hospital where the twins were born.

929
01:03:38,944 --> 01:03:42,030
Would you be careful?
And ask for a handprint validation.

930
01:03:42,281 --> 01:03:44,658
After that, they'll know
they've got Sly.

931
01:03:44,908 --> 01:03:49,037
And my darling niece will have
the police here in less than an hour!

932
01:03:49,288 --> 01:03:52,040
Bare walls! Bare walls in three hours!

933
01:03:52,249 --> 01:03:55,210
- Move it!
- What are you doing? Get a move on!

934
01:03:55,627 --> 01:03:56,461
What's he doing?

935
01:03:57,170 --> 01:04:00,257
Dr Kinder's not taking him
back to his parents.

936
01:04:01,008 --> 01:04:02,551
I don't believe it.

937
01:04:03,468 --> 01:04:05,095
Not Dr Frankenstein, huh?

938
01:04:07,139 --> 01:04:10,475
She's gonna move him tonight.
We've got to help.

939
01:04:10,726 --> 01:04:11,894
They're coming.

940
01:04:12,186 --> 01:04:13,020
Who's coming?

941
01:04:13,228 --> 01:04:16,440
Sly and the kids.
They're coming to break us out.

942
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:18,275
- When?
- Tonight.

943
01:04:18,483 --> 01:04:21,403
We could cross over at any time,
and then she wins.

944
01:04:22,279 --> 01:04:24,573
Either you're with her or with us.

945
01:04:24,865 --> 01:04:26,241
We're with you.

946
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:27,910
Basil, decide.

947
01:04:28,577 --> 01:04:30,162
Decide now.

948
01:04:31,413 --> 01:04:33,123
Let's kick butt!

949
01:04:33,749 --> 01:04:35,125
He's with us.

950
01:04:45,469 --> 01:04:47,596
I think we've got company.

951
01:04:58,273 --> 01:05:00,734
Come on. The mind's
a terrible thing to waste.

952
01:05:05,697 --> 01:05:07,407
Come on, troops. Move it.

953
01:05:09,952 --> 01:05:11,203
What are we gonna do?

954
01:05:11,495 --> 01:05:14,748
- We're gonna train.
- We're going on a train!

955
01:05:16,917 --> 01:05:18,168
Oy vey!

956
01:05:18,377 --> 01:05:19,878
Up, down, up, down...

957
01:05:20,128 --> 01:05:21,129
This is pathetic.

958
01:05:21,338 --> 01:05:24,633
Hut, two, three, four...

959
01:05:25,926 --> 01:05:29,680
You call those jumping jacks?
More like jumping jerks.

960
01:05:29,888 --> 01:05:31,223
Stop! Stop!

961
01:05:33,517 --> 01:05:34,893
Stop!

962
01:05:35,894 --> 01:05:37,145
Hold it!

963
01:05:39,648 --> 01:05:40,899
This isn't working.

964
01:05:41,525 --> 01:05:42,693
What do you expect?

965
01:05:42,985 --> 01:05:44,903
We're geniuses, not ninjas.

966
01:05:45,404 --> 01:05:48,490
Dig deeper, guys.
I need warriors. Now move out.

967
01:05:50,075 --> 01:05:53,245
Under the net. Under the net!

968
01:05:53,453 --> 01:05:54,538
What?

969
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:06,508
Move! Move! Move!

970
01:06:10,846 --> 01:06:12,181
Karate.

971
01:06:17,102 --> 01:06:18,270
Hopeless.

972
01:06:27,905 --> 01:06:30,908
Now let's concentrate.
Okay, one at a time.

973
01:06:31,158 --> 01:06:33,535
One at a time! One at a time!

974
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:36,205
This is harder than I thought.

975
01:06:42,044 --> 01:06:44,046
It's my turn.

976
01:06:52,137 --> 01:06:53,055
Perfect.

977
01:06:55,057 --> 01:06:56,975
Absolutely perfect.

978
01:06:58,185 --> 01:07:01,104
All right, we have to use
our secret weapon.

979
01:07:01,939 --> 01:07:03,565
And what's that?

980
01:07:03,899 --> 01:07:06,026
Duby, what is it adults fear most...

981
01:07:06,235 --> 01:07:07,986
- about babies?
- Dirty diapers.

982
01:07:09,071 --> 01:07:09,988
You're wrong.

983
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:13,450
They make those stupid faces
when they change our diapers.

984
01:07:14,493 --> 01:07:16,954
Dirty diapers. That's funny.

985
01:07:19,456 --> 01:07:20,832
It's our intelligence.

986
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:23,835
We have to use our intelligence.

987
01:07:25,754 --> 01:07:26,588
That's it.

988
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:29,132
All right, everybody. Follow me.

989
01:07:46,567 --> 01:07:49,278
All right, everybody. Take your places.

990
01:07:49,486 --> 01:07:50,654
Move it.

991
01:07:51,238 --> 01:07:52,239
Malcolm, take the flank.

992
01:07:53,198 --> 01:07:54,992
Joey, over here with us.

993
01:07:57,953 --> 01:08:00,330
- Sly, do I have time to go potty?
- The potty?

994
01:08:00,539 --> 01:08:02,833
You're wearing the potty.

995
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:08,005
Put it on hold.
This is much more important.

996
01:08:08,255 --> 01:08:09,339
Easy for you to say.

997
01:08:11,425 --> 01:08:13,051
You are in my power.

998
01:08:13,427 --> 01:08:15,721
You will obey my commands.

999
01:08:16,346 --> 01:08:18,098
What are you trying to do?

1000
01:08:18,307 --> 01:08:21,727
I think grownups remember
our language in their subconscious.

1001
01:08:21,977 --> 01:08:22,811
If I'm right...

1002
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:24,521
I can hypnotize him.

1003
01:08:25,647 --> 01:08:28,108
You are in my power.

1004
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,694
You will obey my commands.

1005
01:08:31,111 --> 01:08:34,156
Before I take the babies home...

1006
01:08:34,448 --> 01:08:36,158
I will drive to Babyco.

1007
01:08:36,366 --> 01:08:39,870
Everything depends
on my driving to Babyco.

1008
01:08:40,829 --> 01:08:42,539
You are in my power.

1009
01:08:42,956 --> 01:08:44,833
You will obey my commands.

1010
01:08:46,126 --> 01:08:48,337
Let's see if we've really got him.

1011
01:08:48,587 --> 01:08:50,505
Lenny, raise your arm.

1012
01:08:53,133 --> 01:08:54,384
All right.

1013
01:08:54,676 --> 01:08:56,970
Make him stick out his tongue.

1014
01:08:57,888 --> 01:08:59,306
Stick out your tongue.

1015
01:09:03,894 --> 01:09:06,021
Make him wiggle his tongue.

1016
01:09:08,899 --> 01:09:10,776
Now, wiggle your tongue.

1017
01:09:17,241 --> 01:09:19,701
Sly, make him pick his nose. Go on.

1018
01:09:20,118 --> 01:09:21,870
Come on, Sly. Make him pick it.

1019
01:09:22,871 --> 01:09:23,789
That's gross.

1020
01:09:24,915 --> 01:09:27,292
- Make him.
- Make him pick his nose.

1021
01:09:27,918 --> 01:09:29,169
Pick your nose now.

1022
01:09:30,128 --> 01:09:31,296
Pick it. Pick it.

1023
01:09:40,681 --> 01:09:42,057
When I snap my fingers...

1024
01:09:43,058 --> 01:09:44,142
you'll wake up.

1025
01:09:45,727 --> 01:09:48,689
Lenny, wake up.
Time to take the kids home.

1026
01:09:48,939 --> 01:09:52,192
Get their jackets on them.
We leave here in 30 minutes.

1027
01:09:52,442 --> 01:09:53,360
I'm up!

1028
01:09:53,986 --> 01:09:55,612
All right, move out.

1029
01:09:57,155 --> 01:09:59,157
Where is that...?

1030
01:10:06,498 --> 01:10:08,876
Boy, this is not your lunch break.

1031
01:10:10,711 --> 01:10:13,088
All right, lce Pick. Hop to it.

1032
01:10:27,769 --> 01:10:29,104
Come on, Carrie.

1033
01:10:29,354 --> 01:10:30,522
Aren't you coming?

1034
01:10:30,772 --> 01:10:32,900
No, I got a job to do here.

1035
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,611
I don't know but I've been told

1036
01:10:35,861 --> 01:10:38,071
Eskimo girls are mighty cold

1037
01:10:38,447 --> 01:10:40,574
Dr Kinder is a son of a gun

1038
01:10:40,908 --> 01:10:43,118
Got cooties and they weigh a ton

1039
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:46,121
One, two, three, four One, two

1040
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:47,247
Three, four.

1041
01:10:47,539 --> 01:10:49,833
- We got it! We got it, Margo!
- We did it!

1042
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:51,376
Where is everybody?

1043
01:10:53,045 --> 01:10:55,422
You got what? An eviction notice?

1044
01:10:55,714 --> 01:10:58,509
We get the whole ball of wax.
The loan, everything.

1045
01:10:58,759 --> 01:11:00,469
We find out tomorrow.
Where is everybody?

1046
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:02,596
Out delivering the kids.

1047
01:11:02,846 --> 01:11:04,014
Is everything okay?

1048
01:11:04,264 --> 01:11:06,558
I don't know.
Something weird's going on.

1049
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:08,310
I got a bad feeling.

1050
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,561
Mrs. Dexter?

1051
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:11,730
He hasn't?

1052
01:11:12,231 --> 01:11:14,107
Randy hasn't gotten home yet.

1053
01:11:14,358 --> 01:11:17,236
- Okay. I'll get right on it.
- It's late.

1054
01:11:22,533 --> 01:11:24,243
Mrs. Walters?

1055
01:11:25,953 --> 01:11:28,664
I know. Well, we're checking into it.

1056
01:11:28,914 --> 01:11:30,332
It's probably a flat tire.

1057
01:11:30,582 --> 01:11:32,417
Okay, I'll phone you back.

1058
01:11:34,211 --> 01:11:35,212
I'll phone the bus.

1059
01:11:38,966 --> 01:11:39,800
Bobbins' bus.

1060
01:11:41,635 --> 01:11:42,553
Where are you?

1061
01:11:44,304 --> 01:11:47,474
We have a vitally important
errand at Babyco.

1062
01:11:48,225 --> 01:11:52,145
We have a vitally important
errand at Babyco.

1063
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:02,531
What did he say?

1064
01:12:02,823 --> 01:12:05,534
They had a vitally important
errand at Babyco.

1065
01:12:05,784 --> 01:12:08,161
Dickie was kind of
saying it along with him.

1066
01:12:08,453 --> 01:12:10,122
Like a song-and-dance team?

1067
01:12:10,372 --> 01:12:12,457
I don't know. They sound like robots.

1068
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:15,711
What kind of errand could they
possibly have at Babyco?

1069
01:12:20,841 --> 01:12:21,925
What is it, honey?

1070
01:12:24,845 --> 01:12:26,221
Yes, Mrs. Skyla.

1071
01:12:27,681 --> 01:12:30,934
I think she's trying to tell us
something about Whit.

1072
01:12:32,352 --> 01:12:34,479
- He's in the bathroom.
- Quack, quack.

1073
01:12:35,522 --> 01:12:37,316
What are you trying to tell us?

1074
01:12:37,524 --> 01:12:39,359
He went off with a duck?

1075
01:12:42,196 --> 01:12:43,363
What is it, sweetie?

1076
01:12:43,572 --> 01:12:44,406
Babyco.

1077
01:12:46,491 --> 01:12:48,410
Hello. Mrs. Hebutis.

1078
01:12:48,911 --> 01:12:50,996
Concentrate, Daddy.

1079
01:12:51,246 --> 01:12:52,998
You can do it, Daddy.

1080
01:12:54,124 --> 01:12:55,209
Try.

1081
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:56,877
Go on. I'm getting it.

1082
01:12:57,127 --> 01:12:59,171
Connect with your inner child.

1083
01:13:01,089 --> 01:13:03,884
- Try harder. Danger!
- What?

1084
01:13:04,885 --> 01:13:07,804
Whit has a twin brother called Sly.

1085
01:13:08,055 --> 01:13:10,265
He's been here for the last two days.

1086
01:13:10,516 --> 01:13:12,351
- What?
- What "what"?

1087
01:13:12,893 --> 01:13:15,687
Sly and Whit got switched
at the mall.

1088
01:13:15,896 --> 01:13:20,067
And Dr Kinder kept Whit
in her secret lab to experiment on.

1089
01:13:20,567 --> 01:13:21,568
Oh, my God!

1090
01:13:21,818 --> 01:13:24,029
- What?
- She says Elena has a secret lab.

1091
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:26,448
I don't believe this.
Whit and Sly got switched.

1092
01:13:26,657 --> 01:13:28,492
What? Who's Sly?

1093
01:13:28,742 --> 01:13:32,579
She's getting rid of the lab
and moving the babies to Liechtenstein.

1094
01:13:33,497 --> 01:13:35,541
Liechtenstein? Oh, my God!

1095
01:13:35,832 --> 01:13:37,376
Liechtenstein? What Liechtenstein?

1096
01:13:37,626 --> 01:13:39,211
I'll tell you on the way.

1097
01:13:39,878 --> 01:13:42,256
Sweetie, do you know
all the secrets to life?

1098
01:13:42,464 --> 01:13:45,634
Sure. Piece of cake.
I'll explain when you get back.

1099
01:13:46,593 --> 01:13:49,596
- What's with the Liechtenstein?
- I'll tell you.

1100
01:13:56,979 --> 01:13:59,189
Liechtenstein.
I hate Liechtenstein!

1101
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:04,319
Hello? 911?
This is an emergency.

1102
01:14:04,528 --> 01:14:08,031
- What is the nature of this emergency?
- There's been a kidnapping.

1103
01:14:08,323 --> 01:14:09,908
And who's been kidnapped?

1104
01:14:10,117 --> 01:14:11,535
My son.

1105
01:14:11,785 --> 01:14:13,996
How old is he?
Who kidnapped him?

1106
01:14:14,288 --> 01:14:17,499
He's almost 2, and his aunt
did it yesterday at the mall.

1107
01:14:17,708 --> 01:14:20,168
His aunt kidnapped him
at the mall yesterday?

1108
01:14:20,419 --> 01:14:22,546
- Right.
- And you're just reporting it?

1109
01:14:22,754 --> 01:14:25,048
She switched him for his twin brother.

1110
01:14:25,299 --> 01:14:26,967
She switched him with his twin?

1111
01:14:28,051 --> 01:14:30,179
- How do you know this?
- My daughter told me.

1112
01:14:30,429 --> 01:14:31,597
How old is she?

1113
01:14:32,097 --> 01:14:33,098
Eighteen months.

1114
01:14:33,307 --> 01:14:35,684
- I know this sounds strange.
- No, sir.

1115
01:14:35,934 --> 01:14:38,395
I get this kind of call all the time.

1116
01:14:39,271 --> 01:14:40,939
Now let me get this straight.

1117
01:14:41,148 --> 01:14:43,942
Your 18-month-old daughter told you...

1118
01:14:44,193 --> 01:14:46,403
that her aunt kidnapped your son...

1119
01:14:46,612 --> 01:14:49,281
by trading him
for his twin at the mall?

1120
01:14:49,865 --> 01:14:51,617
- Is that about it?
- Listen.

1121
01:14:51,825 --> 01:14:55,996
This woman is moving all of the babies
to a secret lab in Liechtenstein!

1122
01:14:56,705 --> 01:14:59,249
A secret lab in Liechtenstein?

1123
01:14:59,791 --> 01:15:01,543
Well, that is serious.

1124
01:15:01,793 --> 01:15:05,964
Give me your name, sir,
and I'll get you all the help you need.

1125
01:15:06,423 --> 01:15:08,467
- She thinks I'm nuts.
- Well, no wonder.

1126
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:10,761
911?

1127
01:15:11,053 --> 01:15:13,597
Now listen.
You know that Babyco building?

1128
01:15:13,847 --> 01:15:18,185
There's a bomb in there, and we're going
to blow those little suckers to Venus!

1129
01:15:22,105 --> 01:15:24,066
You wanted cops? You got cops.

1130
01:15:26,568 --> 01:15:29,029
The magnificent Sly
and the Bobbins' babies...

1131
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:32,491
have a vitally important
errand at Babyco.

1132
01:15:36,745 --> 01:15:38,872
Security personnel, report to stations.

1133
01:15:39,122 --> 01:15:40,290
What are you doing?

1134
01:15:40,541 --> 01:15:42,668
The magnificent Sly
and the Bobbins' babies...

1135
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,963
have a vitally important
errand at Babyco.

1136
01:15:51,134 --> 01:15:52,302
What's up, doc?

1137
01:15:52,594 --> 01:15:53,679
Well, well...

1138
01:15:53,887 --> 01:15:56,265
the resourceful Mr. Sly.

1139
01:15:57,015 --> 01:15:58,976
Go! Go! Move!

1140
01:15:59,309 --> 01:16:02,062
I don't know who
your friends were, Sly...

1141
01:16:02,312 --> 01:16:03,939
but I do know one thing.

1142
01:16:04,523 --> 01:16:06,316
You are mine.

1143
01:16:06,650 --> 01:16:08,777
See you in Joyworld, doc.

1144
01:16:20,914 --> 01:16:23,292
You know the drill. Take your places.

1145
01:16:23,584 --> 01:16:25,794
I'll be in the control centre.
Move out.

1146
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:35,220
Show me the money.

1147
01:16:35,512 --> 01:16:37,306
Fasten your seat belt, doc.

1148
01:16:37,556 --> 01:16:38,974
The ca-ca's gonna hit the fan.

1149
01:16:40,684 --> 01:16:43,604
Okay, robo-entertainers, where are you?

1150
01:16:48,609 --> 01:16:49,526
Beautiful.

1151
01:16:50,194 --> 01:16:51,612
Where are you, big boy?

1152
01:16:53,197 --> 01:16:55,199
Okay, baby, nappy's over.

1153
01:16:55,949 --> 01:16:57,367
Come on, you can do it.

1154
01:16:57,743 --> 01:16:59,203
Give me five.

1155
01:16:59,536 --> 01:17:00,704
That's it. Cool.

1156
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:04,208
Let's bring up some schematics.

1157
01:17:04,917 --> 01:17:07,836
Great. Now for a little rewiring, boys.

1158
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:09,504
And then...

1159
01:17:09,713 --> 01:17:11,673
let the games begin.

1160
01:17:12,633 --> 01:17:16,386
Bring my helicopter to the helipad
at the back of Joyworld.

1161
01:17:16,678 --> 01:17:18,972
Hover and descend on my command.

1162
01:17:28,732 --> 01:17:31,360
What can you hope to get from this?

1163
01:17:31,568 --> 01:17:33,862
Just a little satisfaction, doc.

1164
01:17:35,197 --> 01:17:37,491
Okay, let's get ready to move out.

1165
01:17:38,075 --> 01:17:40,452
All right, Sly, come off it.

1166
01:17:40,744 --> 01:17:42,454
I know it's you.

1167
01:17:42,704 --> 01:17:45,082
Okay, brother, make your move.

1168
01:17:51,338 --> 01:17:53,215
All right. The fun is over.

1169
01:17:53,549 --> 01:17:55,676
Okay, boys, let's march.

1170
01:17:58,262 --> 01:17:59,346
Lights...

1171
01:18:01,682 --> 01:18:02,766
camera...

1172
01:18:04,184 --> 01:18:05,018
action!

1173
01:18:14,194 --> 01:18:15,028
Baby...

1174
01:18:15,237 --> 01:18:17,072
want a hug.

1175
01:18:17,614 --> 01:18:19,700
Baby want a hug.

1176
01:18:20,325 --> 01:18:22,119
- Get them, you fool!
- Go!

1177
01:18:23,161 --> 01:18:25,289
Baby want a hug.

1178
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:31,962
What? No hug?

1179
01:18:34,131 --> 01:18:36,675
That make Baby Bunting mad.

1180
01:18:37,134 --> 01:18:38,302
Get the baby!

1181
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:39,595
Right cross.

1182
01:18:41,013 --> 01:18:42,181
Left hook.

1183
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:45,017
You the one, baby.

1184
01:18:45,225 --> 01:18:47,686
Okay, alien, a little target practice.

1185
01:18:50,731 --> 01:18:52,065
Blew his brains out!

1186
01:18:56,361 --> 01:18:58,155
Merry Christmas!

1187
01:19:00,866 --> 01:19:02,492
And a happy New Year.

1188
01:19:06,121 --> 01:19:09,625
What's the matter with you guys?
These are oversized dolls!

1189
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:10,709
Go, clown.

1190
01:19:11,335 --> 01:19:12,836
You know the drill.

1191
01:19:19,718 --> 01:19:23,013
Lexi, kangaroo. Duby, ostrich.

1192
01:19:28,769 --> 01:19:31,522
Oh, behave, baby!

1193
01:19:37,528 --> 01:19:39,279
Enjoy the ride, suckers!

1194
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:16,275
Not yet.

1195
01:20:16,775 --> 01:20:18,485
Not yet. Now!

1196
01:20:39,464 --> 01:20:40,299
Take him.

1197
01:20:40,591 --> 01:20:43,135
You take him.
I saw what happened last time.

1198
01:20:49,766 --> 01:20:52,227
All right. The Whit man's in the house.

1199
01:20:52,644 --> 01:20:53,812
Get him!

1200
01:21:10,329 --> 01:21:12,039
Basil, out of the park.

1201
01:21:14,333 --> 01:21:16,793
All right, Lexi. Give me five, Basil.

1202
01:21:17,044 --> 01:21:18,712
We're out of here.

1203
01:21:25,177 --> 01:21:27,638
You don't mess with the Sly man, Heep.

1204
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,051
Stop! Stop!

1205
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:08,262
It's you and me, Sly.

1206
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:10,305
Mano a mano.

1207
01:22:10,556 --> 01:22:13,642
You're a tremendous
disappointment to me, Sylvester.

1208
01:22:13,892 --> 01:22:17,729
You never understood
the importance of the work.

1209
01:22:18,438 --> 01:22:20,649
Why, you could've known greatness.

1210
01:22:20,899 --> 01:22:23,944
Instead, you're just gonna be another...

1211
01:22:24,444 --> 01:22:25,612
another kid.

1212
01:22:30,826 --> 01:22:33,287
Are you smart enough to keep
your mouth shut?

1213
01:22:36,206 --> 01:22:37,875
Need I say more?

1214
01:22:42,379 --> 01:22:43,463
Et tu, Basil?

1215
01:22:44,214 --> 01:22:45,549
And proud of it.

1216
01:23:04,193 --> 01:23:06,403
Sly, I knew you'd come back for me.

1217
01:23:06,904 --> 01:23:08,572
Every time, kiddo.

1218
01:23:12,618 --> 01:23:14,494
Sly, are you okay?

1219
01:23:14,745 --> 01:23:15,913
I feel funny.

1220
01:23:17,664 --> 01:23:21,001
No. I think that's Sly.
Sly, are you okay?

1221
01:23:22,669 --> 01:23:24,004
What?

1222
01:23:24,463 --> 01:23:25,547
Helicopter.

1223
01:23:25,839 --> 01:23:27,841
- The helicopter pad?
- Roof.

1224
01:23:28,091 --> 01:23:29,343
The roof? He's on...?

1225
01:23:29,635 --> 01:23:31,553
Oh, my God. Elena!

1226
01:23:45,108 --> 01:23:46,693
Here, take him.

1227
01:23:47,444 --> 01:23:48,445
All right, take him up.

1228
01:24:06,839 --> 01:24:08,215
Take it up, you fool! Up!

1229
01:24:08,465 --> 01:24:09,550
Up?

1230
01:24:10,467 --> 01:24:11,301
Oh, my God!

1231
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:29,987
Dan, are you all right? Are you okay?

1232
01:24:30,237 --> 01:24:31,405
Mommy!

1233
01:24:32,322 --> 01:24:33,490
Mommy!

1234
01:24:34,825 --> 01:24:36,243
Aunt Elena!

1235
01:24:40,205 --> 01:24:41,123
Auntie Elena!

1236
01:24:44,751 --> 01:24:45,836
Lower the chopper.

1237
01:24:51,383 --> 01:24:53,844
Lower the helicopter immediately.

1238
01:24:54,052 --> 01:24:55,304
Do it now.

1239
01:24:55,596 --> 01:24:58,140
This is your last warning.

1240
01:24:58,682 --> 01:25:00,809
Lower the chopper.

1241
01:25:08,859 --> 01:25:11,069
Officer, arrest this woman.
She's insane!

1242
01:25:11,278 --> 01:25:12,779
She's trying to harm the babies.

1243
01:25:12,988 --> 01:25:16,074
Auntie Elena, you tell them
or I swear to God...

1244
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:19,494
For heaven's sakes,
stop calling me that.

1245
01:25:19,828 --> 01:25:21,538
I am not your aunt.

1246
01:25:21,955 --> 01:25:23,040
You're not my aunt?

1247
01:25:23,290 --> 01:25:25,918
Your mother adopted you
when you were 2!

1248
01:25:26,418 --> 01:25:27,336
I was adopted?

1249
01:25:27,878 --> 01:25:31,465
Do you actually think that you and I
come from the same gene pool?

1250
01:25:31,673 --> 01:25:34,384
Thank you, God. Thank you. Thank you!

1251
01:25:38,096 --> 01:25:41,308
I would have felt terrible
hitting my aunt like that.

1252
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:44,228
Officer, that's my son.

1253
01:25:44,436 --> 01:25:46,980
- This is your child, ma'am?
- I know my son.

1254
01:25:50,526 --> 01:25:52,152
Look at your daddy.

1255
01:25:56,782 --> 01:25:58,158
Look at you.

1256
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:06,166
Are you crossing over?

1257
01:26:07,584 --> 01:26:08,836
I think maybe I am.

1258
01:26:10,587 --> 01:26:12,881
Maybe it won't be so bad.

1259
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:15,717
There's just so much they don't know.

1260
01:26:15,968 --> 01:26:17,302
You're right about that.

1261
01:26:18,095 --> 01:26:19,930
But they try so hard.

1262
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:21,557
You gotta love them.

1263
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:25,102
I'll see you on the other side.

1264
01:26:27,062 --> 01:26:29,273
I feel kind of funny myself.

1265
01:26:32,276 --> 01:26:33,777
See you.

1266
01:27:11,565 --> 01:27:12,399
Honey!

1267
01:27:13,859 --> 01:27:14,943
Honey!

1268
01:27:15,485 --> 01:27:18,238
It was a giant baby and a dinosaur.

1269
01:27:18,572 --> 01:27:20,949
- You're remembering.
- Something about Dickie.

1270
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,327
Dickie and Lenny.
They were like a team.

1271
01:27:23,577 --> 01:27:25,454
- Something like that.
- The twins!

1272
01:27:25,704 --> 01:27:27,331
It was a secret lab.

1273
01:27:27,581 --> 01:27:29,249
Liechtenstein. Where are the boys?

1274
01:27:29,499 --> 01:27:31,460
- Everything's fine.
- It's true.

1275
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:34,004
Babies do talk.
Now the whole world knows.

1276
01:27:34,254 --> 01:27:35,672
But only you understood them.

1277
01:27:35,923 --> 01:27:38,008
Whit and Sly.
They can tell us everything.

1278
01:27:38,217 --> 01:27:39,676
Guys.

1279
01:27:41,553 --> 01:27:43,931
Hey, twins! We've got twins.

1280
01:27:44,890 --> 01:27:47,601
Okay, guys, tell me the secrets of life.

1281
01:27:47,976 --> 01:27:51,313
Come on, Sly, what's up?
What's going on out there?

1282
01:27:51,563 --> 01:27:52,814
They've crossed over.

1283
01:27:53,065 --> 01:27:54,942
What? You've crossed over?

1284
01:27:56,151 --> 01:27:59,238
No secrets of life.
No universal knowledge.

1285
01:27:59,696 --> 01:28:02,074
Wait. Carrie knows it.
Come here, Carrie.

1286
01:28:02,950 --> 01:28:03,867
- Right.
- Come here.

1287
01:28:05,202 --> 01:28:06,787
Come here, sweetie.

1288
01:28:06,995 --> 01:28:08,872
Come on. Tell me everything.

1289
01:28:09,122 --> 01:28:10,207
Come on.

1290
01:28:11,667 --> 01:28:13,043
Come on, honey.

1291
01:28:13,710 --> 01:28:15,921
Gee, another Kodak moment.

1292
01:28:16,797 --> 01:28:17,798
I get it.

1293
01:28:18,006 --> 01:28:20,634
You're not gonna
tell me a thing, are you?

1294
01:28:21,426 --> 01:28:22,261
Nope.

1295
01:28:22,469 --> 01:28:26,723
I think she's trying to tell you this
is the way things are supposed to be.

1296
01:28:27,558 --> 01:28:29,184
