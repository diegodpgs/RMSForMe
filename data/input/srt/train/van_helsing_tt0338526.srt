For you, my good son,
this is all a test of faith.

And now,
we need you to go to the East.

168

To the far side of Romania.

169
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:47,537
An accursed land...

170
00:15:47,622 --> 00:15:50,576
terrorized by all sorts
of nightmarish creatures.

171
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:54,042
CARDINAL: Lorded over
by a certain Count Dracula.

172
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:56,705
VAN HELSING: Dracula?
CARDINAL: Yes.

173

You've never faced one
like this before.

174
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:04,217
Our story begins 450 years ago...

175
00:16:04,305 --> 00:16:07,840
when a Transylvanian knight
named Valerious the Elder...

176
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,635
promised God that his family
would never rest nor enter heaven...

177
00:16:11,729 --> 00:16:14,730
until they vanquished Dracula
from their land.

178
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,231
They have not succeeded...

179
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,398
and they are running out of family.

180
00:16:21,322 --> 00:16:25,569
CARDINAL: His descendant Boris Valerious,
King of the Gypsies.

181
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:28,323
He disappeared almost 12 months ago.

182
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:34,748
CARDINAL: His only son, Prince Velkan,
and his daughter, Princess Anna.

183
00:16:35,086 --> 00:16:38,371
CARDINAL: If the two of them are killed
before Dracula is vanquished...

184
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,587
nine generations of their family...

185
00:16:40,675 --> 00:16:43,296
will never enter
the gates of St. Peter.

186
00:16:43,928 --> 00:16:45,755
For more than four centuries...

187
00:16:45,846 --> 00:16:48,551
this family has defended
our left flank.

188
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,515
They gave their lives.

189
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:53,938
We cannot let them
slip into purgatory.

190
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:56,310
So you're sending me into hell.

191
00:16:58,401 --> 00:16:59,776
In a manner.

192
00:17:02,863 --> 00:17:06,529
Valerious the Elder left this here
400 years ago.

193
00:17:07,285 --> 00:17:09,111
We don't know its purpose...

left it lightly.

"In the name of God,
open this door."

197
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:20,629
There is an insignia.

198
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,251
Yes, it matches your ring.

199

I think that in Transylvania
you may find the answer you seek.

the son of Valerious the Elder.

when Dracula was murdered.

VAN HELSING: Do you know
who murdered him?

976

CARL: No, there's just some vague reference
to the Left Hand of God.

977
01:32:03,030 --> 01:32:06,482
And in 1462, when Dracula died...

978
01:32:06,576 --> 01:32:09,826
- he made a covenant with the Devil.
- And was given a new life.

979
01:32:09,912 --> 01:32:12,949
But the only way he could sustain
that life was by drinking blood.

And your ancestor,
having sired this evil creature...

went to Rome to seek forgiveness.
That's when the bargain was made.

He was to kill Dracula...

in return for eternal salvation
of his entire family...

988
01:32:32,977 --> 01:32:35,978
As evil as Dracula was, my ancestor
couldn't kill his own son.

989
01:32:36,063 --> 01:32:39,267
So he banished him
to an icy fortress...

990
01:32:39,358 --> 01:32:42,110
sending him through a door
from which there was no return.

991
01:32:42,194 --> 01:32:44,068
- And then the Devil gave him wings.
- Yes.

- I don't know.

kill his son, he left clues.

So that future generations
might do it for him.

That must be what my father
was looking for in here.

But you're supposed to die.

1135

I want to live.

1136

All right!

Be happy in the knowledge...

that I shall weep
over your dead body.

My children live.

Then the only way to kill them
is to kill you.

We are both part of
the same grand game, Gabriel.

1154

Yes!

You are being used, Gabriel,
as was I.

1166

But I escaped. So can you.

[Screaming in sudden pain]

We could be friends. Partners!

Brothers-in-arms!

1178

Did I mention that it was you
who murdered me?

1179
01:56:03,262 --> 01:56:07,046
It must be such a burden.
Such a curse...

1180

to be the Left Hand of God.
