1
00:03:12,613 --> 00:03:15,613
It all started on the day that I died.

2
00:03:15,648 --> 00:03:17,524
If there had been an obituary...

3
00:03:18,013 --> 00:03:20,891
...it would've described
the unremarkable life...

4
00:03:21,013 --> 00:03:23,402
...of an unremarkable woman...

5
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:25,563
...survived by no one.

6
00:03:25,813 --> 00:03:27,405
But there was no obituary...

7
00:03:27,613 --> 00:03:29,729
...because the day that I died...

8
00:03:30,013 --> 00:03:33,892
...was also the day I started to live.

9
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,010
But that comes later.

10
00:03:47,413 --> 00:03:48,578
This was my life.

11
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:51,605
Days blended together,
consistently ordinary...

12
00:03:51,613 --> 00:03:55,003
...thanks to a job that was the practical
version of my passion.

13
00:03:55,213 --> 00:03:57,283
- I'm sorry.
- Watch where you’re going!

14
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:59,968
I was supposed to be an artist by now.

15
00:04:00,013 --> 00:04:01,241
Instead...

16
00:04:01,813 --> 00:04:04,930
...I was designing ads for beauty cream.

17
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:11,978
- You are so addicted to that stuff, Sally.
- Happily.

18
00:04:12,013 --> 00:04:14,846
- Beau-line is magic in a bottle.
- I don't know how you get it.

19
00:04:15,013 --> 00:04:17,766
- It's not even in production yet.
- We have our ways.

20
00:04:19,813 --> 00:04:21,371
- Hey.
- No!

21
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,925
Headaches again.
My brain's all tight and cranky.

22
00:04:27,613 --> 00:04:31,778
In one week, precisely, we will launch
the most exciting...

23
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,771
...and revolutionary product
to hit the beauty industry since...

24
00:04:36,013 --> 00:04:37,412
...soap.

25
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:39,926
Beau-line.

26
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:44,530
Now, Beau-line doesn't
just hide the effects of aging...

27
00:04:45,013 --> 00:04:46,526
...it actually reverses them.

28
00:04:46,813 --> 00:04:48,610
However, with change...

29
00:04:49,213 --> 00:04:51,124
...must come sacrifice.

30
00:04:51,613 --> 00:04:53,251
My husband...

31
00:04:53,413 --> 00:04:57,613
...and I have decided that
it's time for me to step aside...

32
00:04:57,648 --> 00:04:59,205
...as the face of Hedare.

33
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:02,371
It has been a magnificent 15 years.

34
00:05:03,013 --> 00:05:07,213
But we have decided to choose
a new face to represent Beau-line.

35
00:05:07,248 --> 00:05:08,612
Exactly.

36
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:11,126
Drina.

37
00:05:11,413 --> 00:05:13,290
The future of Hedare Beauty.

38
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:17,402
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I look forward...

39
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:22,086
...to seeing you at the gala, where you
can toast to Drina and our success.

40
00:05:22,213 --> 00:05:25,444
Careful, George.
She's not old enough to drink.

41
00:05:30,613 --> 00:05:34,447
You've got more talent than anybody
in the building, which I hate you for.

42
00:05:34,813 --> 00:05:39,013
Sal, this is my first lead campaign.
It's gotta be perfect. You know that.

43
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,402
What is wrong with you?!

44
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:44,441
Good luck.

45
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:46,966
Yeah.

46
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,973
You simply couldn't resist it, could you?

47
00:05:50,413 --> 00:05:53,325
You had to make
a scene out of it, Laurel.

48
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:54,928
What's the matter, George?

49
00:05:54,963 --> 00:05:56,444
Did I steal your moment?

50
00:05:57,613 --> 00:05:59,171
Come in!

51
00:06:14,413 --> 00:06:15,971
Hi, Mr. Hedare.

52
00:06:17,413 --> 00:06:19,449
Did you still want to see me, or...?

53
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:22,566
- Sit.
- Right. Okay.

54
00:06:27,013 --> 00:06:28,651
I'm not pleased.

55
00:06:31,213 --> 00:06:34,444
This isn't even close to what I wanted.

56
00:06:34,813 --> 00:06:37,008
I can't imagine what on earth
you were thinking.

57
00:06:37,213 --> 00:06:38,362
I am so sorry-

58
00:06:38,413 --> 00:06:41,803
I mean, look at this red. It's all wrong.
I wanted it darker.

59
00:06:42,013 --> 00:06:46,723
- I specifically heard you say-
- I know what I said.

60
00:06:47,413 --> 00:06:49,813
- Okay. Maybe I misunderstood you.
- Clearly.

61
00:06:49,848 --> 00:06:51,690
Mr. Hedare, I know I can fix it.

62
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:54,329
If you give me a chance,
I know I can fix it.

63
00:06:54,613 --> 00:06:56,922
I do not reward incompetence.

64
00:06:57,013 --> 00:07:02,212
I have no idea why I expected your art
to show better taste than your wardrobe.

65
00:07:02,413 --> 00:07:05,325
Oh, and do try and get
a manicure, will you?

66
00:07:05,413 --> 00:07:07,563
Oh, for God's sake, George.

67
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:10,178
Let her fix it.

68
00:07:10,213 --> 00:07:11,965
She's good and you know it.

69
00:07:13,813 --> 00:07:14,978
Whatever.

70
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:16,571
By tomorrow night.

71
00:07:17,413 --> 00:07:18,687
Midnight.

72
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:20,965
Right. Thank you.

73
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:08,371
Excuse me. Hi!

74
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:13,365
Do you think you could just
maybe turn the music down...

75
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:16,364
...just a little bit?

76
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:18,491
No? Okay.

77
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:08,203
Kitty! Kitty.

78
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:11,605
How'd you get up there?
Come down here.

79
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:15,810
What, are you stuck?

80
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:20,928
You're gonna make me come out there.

81
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,893
Hey! Easy! Hold on a minute!
Wait! Wait! Wait!

82
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,098
Whatever you're thinking or feeling...

83
00:09:57,133 --> 00:10:00,133
...it's not worth it, you understand?
I'm a cop. Maybe I can help.

84
00:10:00,168 --> 00:10:01,566
Okay. I'm fine.

85
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:03,525
- It's just that-
- Listen to me.

86
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:06,406
We'll get through this together.
What's your name?

87
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:08,328
Patience Phillips.

88
00:10:08,363 --> 00:10:09,924
But this cat...

89
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:13,609
Sure, sure, Patience,
and it's a real beauty.

90
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:17,206
- Very cute.
- The cat's not up here anymore.

91
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:20,730
Okay. And I'm sure that
makes you very sad.

92
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:23,203
- What's your apartment number?
- Twenty-three!

93
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:24,727
Hold on!

94
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:28,122
Hurry.

95
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,532
I got you.

96
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,801
- You okay?
- Thanks.

97
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:48,844
You sure you're okay?

98
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:51,685
That was the cat.

99
00:10:51,733 --> 00:10:52,898
You weren't kidding.

100
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:55,447
You actually climbed out there
to rescue your cat?

101
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:58,333
Yeah. I mean, no.
It's not my cat, it's a cat.

102
00:10:58,368 --> 00:11:00,164
To rescue somebody else's cat?

103
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:02,610
Well, that's something else.

104
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:06,810
Oh, my gosh, I'm late for my job!

105
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:11,491
- I'm on a deadline today.
- Yeah? Well, good luck with that.

106
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:12,682
Thanks.

107
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:14,166
Thank you!

108
00:11:53,773 --> 00:11:56,492
After all, no one can defeat Father Time.

109
00:11:57,373 --> 00:12:00,729
Though you did put up
a hell of a fight, didn't you?

110
00:12:00,973 --> 00:12:04,886
Beau-line works wonders, doesn't it?

111
00:12:05,173 --> 00:12:06,572
Yes, it does.

112
00:12:07,573 --> 00:12:09,131
I have a busy day today.

113
00:12:09,373 --> 00:12:12,604
Drinks, then dinner.
Don't wait up, will you, darling?

114
00:12:12,973 --> 00:12:15,973
I stopped waiting
a long time ago, George.

115
00:12:16,008 --> 00:12:18,646
Oh, and that lunch tomorrow?

116
00:12:18,973 --> 00:12:21,885
- Cancel that too, will you?
- Problems?

117
00:12:22,573 --> 00:12:23,738
I doubt it...

118
00:12:23,773 --> 00:12:27,732
...but Slavicky won't stop calling.
You know scientists.

119
00:12:27,973 --> 00:12:32,649
They're worse than models. You have to
coddle them all the time like little children.

120
00:12:32,773 --> 00:12:36,129
I'll have Wesley reschedule. Bye.

121
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:57,524
Hey! Man sandwich, 12 o'clock.

122
00:12:59,773 --> 00:13:01,252
Oh, my God.

123
00:13:08,173 --> 00:13:09,765
Hello, Miss Phillips.

124
00:13:09,973 --> 00:13:11,406
Hi.

125
00:13:13,573 --> 00:13:17,173
This is the officer I was telling you
about from earlier.

126
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,652
Detective Lone.

127
00:13:20,173 --> 00:13:23,131
- Tom Lone.
- God, that is such a good name.

128
00:13:23,773 --> 00:13:24,938
Tom Lone.

129
00:13:24,973 --> 00:13:28,329
Rhymes with cone, phone, bone.

130
00:13:29,773 --> 00:13:31,923
Not that rhyming's all that important.

131
00:13:33,373 --> 00:13:35,682
I'll just be in my cubicle.

132
00:13:36,373 --> 00:13:37,647
Alone.

133
00:13:42,373 --> 00:13:44,409
- Hi.
- Hi.

134
00:13:45,373 --> 00:13:47,728
How'd you get...?

135
00:13:48,973 --> 00:13:50,138
You dropped something.

136
00:13:50,173 --> 00:13:52,846
You can really cover a lot of ground
when you're in a hurry.

137
00:13:53,173 --> 00:13:54,526
Thanks.

138
00:13:56,173 --> 00:13:57,367
Is this yours?

139
00:13:58,573 --> 00:14:00,086
Yeah.

140
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:01,538
- It's nice.
- Thanks.

141
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:04,326
Yeah, it kind of reminds me
of early Chagall.

142
00:14:04,573 --> 00:14:05,892
Elegant, but whimsical.

143
00:14:06,373 --> 00:14:08,138
Very much in the...

144
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:11,051
...tradition of the old Dutch Masters.
- I'm impressed.

145
00:14:11,173 --> 00:14:15,610
Don't be. I noticed all the art in your
apartment, so I Googled it at the office.

146
00:14:15,973 --> 00:14:18,726
- No, but really, I like it.
- Thanks.

147
00:14:19,573 --> 00:14:24,010
Listen, I wanted to apologize about this
morning for thinking you were a jumper.

148
00:14:24,373 --> 00:14:26,738
I was hoping to make it up
by taking you to coffee.

149
00:14:26,773 --> 00:14:30,766
I know this great Italian place
around the corner, Grecchio's on 6th.

150
00:14:30,973 --> 00:14:34,443
Or, listen, maybe tomorrow's better.
Say, 1:00?

151
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:37,567
Yes.

152
00:14:39,973 --> 00:14:41,770
- Okay.
- Yeah?

153
00:14:41,773 --> 00:14:43,491
Okay. So tomorrow then, 1:00.

154
00:14:43,573 --> 00:14:45,803
- You make sure she gets there.
- Yes, officer.

155
00:14:45,973 --> 00:14:48,168
- Counting on you.
- I screw it up...

156
00:14:48,373 --> 00:14:50,329
...you can throw away the key.

157
00:14:52,573 --> 00:14:54,131
See you tomorrow.

158
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:55,886
Okay, bye.

159
00:14:58,573 --> 00:14:59,722
Patience.

160
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,606
- That is a man in serious like with you.
- You think?

161
00:15:03,373 --> 00:15:05,211
- Hello.
- We got a lot of work to do.

162
00:15:05,246 --> 00:15:07,050
First, you gotta shave those legs.

163
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,573
Second, wear that leather outfit
we got you for your birthday.

164
00:15:10,608 --> 00:15:13,849
- Remember?
- First, it's only coffee.

165
00:15:14,173 --> 00:15:19,725
And second, I will never, ever,
ever wear that leather outfit.

166
00:15:36,053 --> 00:15:37,486
Good night!

167
00:15:42,053 --> 00:15:44,203
Hi, this is Patience
in the art department.

168
00:15:44,453 --> 00:15:48,048
Yeah, I'm expecting a messenger
to come and pick up-

169
00:15:48,053 --> 00:15:51,250
But it's gotta be there by midnight.

170
00:15:52,253 --> 00:15:55,450
Well, I...
I know it's not your fault, but...

171
00:15:57,053 --> 00:15:58,452
Okay.

172
00:15:58,853 --> 00:16:00,411
I'll take it myself.

173
00:16:31,253 --> 00:16:33,972
Hello? Is anybody in there?

174
00:16:42,053 --> 00:16:44,123
Oh, come on, Slavicky.

175
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:46,205
When did you grow a conscience?

176
00:16:46,253 --> 00:16:49,643
I don't care that the FDA never saw
the headaches...

177
00:16:49,853 --> 00:16:52,321
...and the nausea
and the fainting spells.

178
00:16:52,853 --> 00:16:55,651
Those are symptoms I can live with.

179
00:16:58,853 --> 00:17:00,206
Hello?

180
00:17:04,253 --> 00:17:08,453
And with what we stand to make
from consumers demanding their fix...

181
00:17:08,488 --> 00:17:10,444
...I can live with it being addictive.

182
00:17:10,853 --> 00:17:13,686
But these side effects
from the long-term studies...

183
00:17:13,853 --> 00:17:17,687
That won't happen if they keep using it.
And we'll make sure they do...

184
00:17:18,053 --> 00:17:20,408
...because that's where
the money comes from.

185
00:17:20,453 --> 00:17:22,205
I'm not sure anymore.

186
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,403
Hello? Hello?

187
00:17:39,053 --> 00:17:40,725
I thought I could live with it...

188
00:17:42,653 --> 00:17:45,406
...but I can't live with turning
people into monsters.

189
00:17:46,253 --> 00:17:47,402
Oh, my gosh!

190
00:17:47,453 --> 00:17:51,128
You've gotta let me pull the plug.
We can't let this go on the shelves.

191
00:17:52,853 --> 00:17:53,968
Who's there?

192
00:17:55,253 --> 00:17:57,608
- Armando, come in.
- I'm on my way.

193
00:18:18,053 --> 00:18:20,283
You can come out now.
It's okay.

194
00:18:20,453 --> 00:18:22,762
We'd just like to ask you
a few questions.

195
00:18:25,253 --> 00:18:26,368
Sorry.

196
00:18:27,053 --> 00:18:29,886
But I think maybe I'm in the wrong-

197
00:18:31,253 --> 00:18:34,290
- What are you doing?
- Don't ever do that again.

198
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,127
Where is she?

199
00:19:19,853 --> 00:19:22,083
She ran down to waste treatment,
jumped in a pipe.

200
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,648
We don't know who she is,
but we know what she heard.

201
00:19:25,853 --> 00:19:28,686
We can't risk it.
Get rid of her.

202
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,811
Seal the door.

203
00:25:10,213 --> 00:25:12,602
Patience Phillips,
I've never been so proud of you.

204
00:25:12,613 --> 00:25:15,252
You 're probably sipping
your decaf soy whatever...

205
00:25:15,613 --> 00:25:18,173
...fantasizing about licking
the foam off his lips.

206
00:25:18,613 --> 00:25:21,411
Wait, that's what I'm doing.
How'd the presentation go?

207
00:25:21,446 --> 00:25:24,210
Did you get me free samples of it?
Listen, call me.

208
00:25:28,213 --> 00:25:29,612
What...?

209
00:25:34,213 --> 00:25:36,773
Hi, I'll take a decaf latte.

210
00:25:37,213 --> 00:25:40,523
Hey, Patience, it's Tom Lone.
I'm here at Grecchio's waiting...

211
00:25:40,813 --> 00:25:42,849
...and you 're not here.

212
00:25:43,813 --> 00:25:46,646
Anyway, I gotta get back to work, so...

213
00:25:46,813 --> 00:25:48,246
Bye.

214
00:26:03,013 --> 00:26:06,403
Okay, kitty.
It's time for you to go home.

215
00:26:07,813 --> 00:26:08,848
Now...

216
00:26:30,493 --> 00:26:32,165
- Are you Ophelia Powers?
- Yes.

217
00:26:32,293 --> 00:26:35,285
- I got your cat off a ledge and ever since-
- Why, Midnight.

218
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:38,251
You've never brought a stranger
home before.

219
00:26:38,893 --> 00:26:40,485
Please, come in.

220
00:26:41,293 --> 00:26:44,683
No, I can't come in.
I've got to go to- I'm late.

221
00:27:05,893 --> 00:27:07,565
- Midnight.
- I'm sorry?

222
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:08,967
Her name.

223
00:27:09,493 --> 00:27:14,328
She's an Egyptian Mau,
the rarest of breeds. Temple cats.

224
00:27:14,893 --> 00:27:17,202
It's said that Maus have
special powers.

225
00:27:17,893 --> 00:27:20,009
Like popping out of nowhere? I know.

226
00:27:20,293 --> 00:27:22,011
Among other things.

227
00:27:26,293 --> 00:27:27,612
Your cat...

228
00:27:28,693 --> 00:27:30,092
Socrates!

229
00:27:30,493 --> 00:27:31,687
No caffeine.

230
00:27:33,493 --> 00:27:35,211
It makes him irritable.

231
00:27:35,293 --> 00:27:38,012
You look a little out of sorts yourself,
my dear.

232
00:27:38,893 --> 00:27:40,292
The cats, perhaps.

233
00:27:40,693 --> 00:27:43,693
They seem to be taking quite
an unusual shine to you.

234
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:46,969
This has been a really bad day
for me already.

235
00:27:47,293 --> 00:27:50,922
- I can't even remember most of yesterday.
- Perhaps I can help you.

236
00:27:51,493 --> 00:27:52,721
Right.

237
00:27:53,293 --> 00:27:56,205
This really isn't your problem.
I don't even know why I'm here.

238
00:27:56,293 --> 00:27:56,893
- It's all right. Tell me.
- Really. I'm late for work.

239
00:27:59,893 --> 00:28:03,932
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't even...
- Come back anytime. I'm always here.

240
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:15,521
Catnip.

241
00:28:22,693 --> 00:28:23,887
No-

242
00:28:30,493 --> 00:28:33,405
I'm fine. I am fine.

243
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:36,569
What the hell is wrong with you?!

244
00:28:37,013 --> 00:28:39,652
You never delivered the design!

245
00:28:40,013 --> 00:28:41,778
You don't even know where they are.

246
00:28:41,813 --> 00:28:46,409
You do not know where they are because,
and I quote you, you "cannot remember"!

247
00:28:46,613 --> 00:28:50,083
Your incompetence is staggering!

248
00:28:53,213 --> 00:28:55,966
Are you even listening to me?

249
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:07,892
I'm sorry!

250
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:10,732
"Sorry"?

251
00:29:12,413 --> 00:29:14,210
Sorry's not nearly enough.

252
00:29:14,813 --> 00:29:16,041
Okay.

253
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:19,124
Then let me try the remix.

254
00:29:21,413 --> 00:29:24,378
I'm sorry for every second I wasted...

255
00:29:24,413 --> 00:29:29,282
...working for an untalented,
unethical egomaniac like you.

256
00:29:30,413 --> 00:29:33,723
Clean out your cubicle. You are fired.

257
00:29:37,013 --> 00:29:38,731
Wait! Mr. Hedare!

258
00:29:40,013 --> 00:29:41,844
I didn't mean it.

259
00:29:43,613 --> 00:29:44,682
Did I?

260
00:29:46,013 --> 00:29:47,651
My hero.

261
00:29:55,013 --> 00:29:57,447
Where did that come from?

262
00:30:08,813 --> 00:30:11,168
I don't know,
it's like I can't describe it.

263
00:30:11,213 --> 00:30:14,808
I was saying it, but I wasn't saying it.
Do you understand?

264
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,805
Whoever said it has the thanks
of a grateful art department.

265
00:30:17,813 --> 00:30:20,805
You don't understand, Sal.
I wanted to cause him pain.

266
00:30:25,013 --> 00:30:26,526
I'm sorry.

267
00:30:26,813 --> 00:30:28,405
- What was that?
- Allergies?

268
00:30:29,213 --> 00:30:31,010
Maybe?

269
00:30:40,013 --> 00:30:41,813
You just got fired, remember?

270
00:30:41,848 --> 00:30:43,724
But it's so pretty.

271
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:48,909
Sal? Sal?

272
00:30:48,944 --> 00:30:50,605
Sally?

273
00:30:50,813 --> 00:30:52,610
Sally! Sally?

274
00:30:55,613 --> 00:30:56,841
Hey.

275
00:30:57,413 --> 00:31:01,013
Ever noticed when they keep you for
observation no one really observes you?

276
00:31:01,048 --> 00:31:03,971
- Did they tell you what was wrong?
- Oh, they have no idea.

277
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,808
They did run a million fun tests, though.

278
00:31:06,843 --> 00:31:09,004
Hey, upside, you gotta see my doctor.

279
00:31:09,413 --> 00:31:11,324
I can see you're feeling better.

280
00:31:11,813 --> 00:31:14,813
Reminds me, what's up with the
"hot yet modest, but who cares...

281
00:31:14,848 --> 00:31:17,008
...because he's so hot" detective?

282
00:31:19,013 --> 00:31:20,178
It's not gonna work out, Sal.

283
00:31:20,213 --> 00:31:22,283
Patience, you never think
it's gonna work.

284
00:31:22,613 --> 00:31:27,403
Because it doesn't. I've got a good
reason for saying it this time. Trust me.

285
00:31:27,413 --> 00:31:30,325
Look, this time I refuse
to let you sabotage a good thing.

286
00:31:30,413 --> 00:31:32,324
If it's broke, fix it.

287
00:31:32,813 --> 00:31:36,726
All right? Now, I love you,
and he is gonna love you. Now, go.

288
00:31:37,013 --> 00:31:39,049
Go give him some brown sugar.

289
00:31:40,013 --> 00:31:41,550
I gotta meet my hottie doctor.

290
00:31:41,585 --> 00:31:43,087
Tell me I look vulnerable.

291
00:31:45,373 --> 00:31:48,206
Being good is something you keep
in your heart because you put it there.

292
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:51,729
I'm not saying it's easy. I'm not saying
some people don't choose to be bad.

293
00:31:51,973 --> 00:31:54,973
But I want something different for you.
I want something better.

294
00:31:55,008 --> 00:31:57,282
- You understand?
- Yeah.

295
00:31:58,573 --> 00:32:00,006
- Can I see your gun?
- No.

296
00:32:00,373 --> 00:32:02,443
- You know what makes somebody-
- Will you shoot it?

297
00:32:02,773 --> 00:32:04,252
No.

298
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:14,645
I want you to be
the good guys, got it?

299
00:32:14,773 --> 00:32:17,412
- Yeah.
- Let's go shoot some hoops.

300
00:32:24,973 --> 00:32:25,573
I called the police station
and they said you might be here.

301
00:32:31,573 --> 00:32:34,292
You never got your coffee.

302
00:32:36,973 --> 00:32:41,410
Well, you're a brave man to be facing
a mob like this. No backup?

303
00:32:41,773 --> 00:32:43,889
I'm used to working alone,
most of the time.

304
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:46,368
- Is that by choice, or-
- Yeah, theirs.

305
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,338
No, I've had partners before.

306
00:32:48,373 --> 00:32:50,284
Turns out I take my job too seriously.

307
00:32:50,773 --> 00:32:53,287
You know my friend Sally?
That's what she says about me.

308
00:32:53,773 --> 00:32:56,138
She says that I'm fun-deficient.

309
00:32:56,173 --> 00:32:58,243
- I don't believe that.
- That's what she says.

310
00:32:58,573 --> 00:32:59,738
One-on-one?

311
00:32:59,773 --> 00:33:02,367
- Who? Me and her?
- Yeah, come on.

312
00:33:03,973 --> 00:33:05,486
You wanna do this?

313
00:33:05,773 --> 00:33:08,651
One-on-one
One-on-one

314
00:33:24,973 --> 00:33:27,373
I haven't done that since I was a kid.

315
00:33:27,408 --> 00:33:28,965
Come on.

316
00:34:27,373 --> 00:34:29,284
Can we have our ball back?

317
00:34:30,973 --> 00:34:33,851
You don't seem so fun-deficient to me.

318
00:34:47,013 --> 00:34:50,688
Mr. Hedare wanted me to inform you
he'll be at the factory the rest of the day.

319
00:34:51,213 --> 00:34:53,568
If by "factory"
you mean the Four Seasons...

320
00:34:53,613 --> 00:34:55,888
...teaching Drina
to unlock the minibar...

321
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:58,607
...consider me informed.
- He'll be working with-

322
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:04,041
Wesley, George hasn't said anything
meaningful to me since he said "I do."

323
00:35:37,413 --> 00:35:39,563
- Hello?
- You'd think with the advances...

324
00:35:39,813 --> 00:35:42,373
...in medicine, this place
would have a wet bar.

325
00:35:42,813 --> 00:35:46,413
- Seems like you're feeling better.
- Some new medication I can't pronounce.

326
00:35:46,448 --> 00:35:49,883
- So, what's up?
- Nothing. Just fixing a little snack.

327
00:35:50,013 --> 00:35:53,050
What I'd like to know is
did you fix it with the cute cop?

328
00:35:55,413 --> 00:35:57,005
I think I did.

329
00:35:59,013 --> 00:36:00,890
Details! And make it good, honey.

330
00:36:01,413 --> 00:36:04,405
I'm sitting here in a paper dress,
for God's sakes.

331
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:07,485
All we did was talk.
And play a little one-on-one.

332
00:36:08,013 --> 00:36:10,378
- You know how to play basketball?
- Apparently I do.

333
00:36:10,413 --> 00:36:14,201
- I even went Shaquille on his butt.
- Patience, have I taught you nothing?

334
00:36:14,613 --> 00:36:17,081
You never beat a guy at sports.
It messes them up.

335
00:36:17,613 --> 00:36:20,013
They end up in a men's group,
banging on a drum.

336
00:36:20,048 --> 00:36:22,288
It's not like I meant to.
It just happened.

337
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:28,045
I'm telling you, Sal, something really,
really weird is happening to me.

338
00:36:28,413 --> 00:36:31,849
- I practically jumped him.
- That's called lust, sweetheart.

339
00:36:32,013 --> 00:36:34,891
- Animal attraction.
- You think?

340
00:36:36,213 --> 00:36:37,726
What if it gets worse?

341
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:43,767
- I mean, what if the next time-
- Next time? He asked you out again?

342
00:36:44,013 --> 00:36:47,528
- I love this guy.
- So do I. But it's me I'm worried about.

343
00:36:48,213 --> 00:36:51,813
- I felt like I couldn't be myself.
- Well, feel free to be me next time.

344
00:36:51,848 --> 00:36:55,283
- Sally-
- I'm teasing. Just be yourself.

345
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:57,731
Myself.

346
00:36:58,413 --> 00:36:59,846
Okay.

347
00:37:00,813 --> 00:37:02,565
- I'll try.
- Oh, I gotta go.

348
00:37:02,613 --> 00:37:05,650
Future father of my children's coming.
Sweet dreams, honey.

349
00:37:06,813 --> 00:37:10,044
Excuse me.
I think I might have a fever.

350
00:37:24,178 --> 00:37:25,611
Hey!

351
00:37:25,978 --> 00:37:28,128
- Shut that off!
- Get a life!

352
00:37:28,378 --> 00:37:30,733
Yeah, get a life, you loser!

353
00:37:43,978 --> 00:37:47,254
Sorry, babe.
This ain't the slumber party.

354
00:37:48,778 --> 00:37:49,927
However...

355
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:52,048
...in your case,
I can make an exception.

356
00:37:52,378 --> 00:37:53,543
I'm flattered.

357
00:37:53,578 --> 00:37:55,330
But do you think this one time...

358
00:37:55,978 --> 00:37:59,493
...you could turn the music down
just a little...

359
00:37:59,578 --> 00:38:01,216
...bit.

360
00:38:12,778 --> 00:38:15,690
Tell you what,
why don't I do it myself?

361
00:38:16,978 --> 00:38:20,414
Hey! Hey! Listen, you freak-

362
00:38:24,178 --> 00:38:27,693
I'm sorry, what did you say?
Is the music still too loud?

363
00:38:30,178 --> 00:38:32,009
Hey!

364
00:38:40,378 --> 00:38:43,176
You hear that? It's called silence.

365
00:38:43,378 --> 00:38:46,734
That's all I ever wanted.
Now, keep it down.

366
00:38:46,978 --> 00:38:50,254
Thanks for the party. I had fun.

367
00:39:33,178 --> 00:39:36,534
- Time to accessorize.
- My bike!

368
00:40:52,938 --> 00:40:54,610
Amateurs.

369
00:41:01,338 --> 00:41:06,138
You boys thought you could come in here
and steal all these beautiful things?

370
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:09,255
What a perfect idea.

371
00:42:35,538 --> 00:42:36,687
Meow.

372
00:43:48,138 --> 00:43:50,288
That was one of a kind.

373
00:43:50,538 --> 00:43:53,575
- From Egypt.
- That's a hell of a profile.

374
00:43:54,138 --> 00:43:56,811
Thieves said she jumps around
like a cat.

375
00:43:57,138 --> 00:44:01,575
What should we call her?
"Cat Chick"? No, no."Cat Broad."

376
00:44:01,938 --> 00:44:03,417
What do you got?

377
00:44:21,738 --> 00:44:23,694
Cupcakes.

378
00:45:22,298 --> 00:45:23,731
Midnight.

379
00:45:37,298 --> 00:45:40,370
I knew you'd come back
when you were ready.

380
00:45:53,498 --> 00:45:55,807
The goddess Bast.

381
00:46:02,498 --> 00:46:06,616
The Maus are sacred to Bast.
They're her messengers.

382
00:46:06,698 --> 00:46:10,691
- You wrote this?
- I was a professor for 20 years...

383
00:46:10,898 --> 00:46:12,889
...until I was denied tenure.

384
00:46:13,298 --> 00:46:15,289
Male academia.

385
00:46:18,098 --> 00:46:19,863
Bast is a rarity.

386
00:46:19,898 --> 00:46:22,731
A goddess of the moon,
and of the sun.

387
00:46:22,898 --> 00:46:27,528
She represents the duality in all women.
Docile, yet aggressive.

388
00:46:27,698 --> 00:46:30,258
Nurturing, yet ferocious.

389
00:46:31,298 --> 00:46:34,688
But what does all of this
have to do with me? I mean-

390
00:46:34,898 --> 00:46:37,207
What happened the other night?

391
00:46:37,898 --> 00:46:41,493
- I don't remember.
- Do you want me to tell you?

392
00:46:42,098 --> 00:46:43,292
Yes.

393
00:46:43,298 --> 00:46:44,890
You died.

394
00:46:46,898 --> 00:46:48,217
What?

395
00:46:48,698 --> 00:46:50,973
I didn't die. Look at me, I'm right here.

396
00:46:51,098 --> 00:46:52,895
You died.

397
00:46:53,498 --> 00:46:56,251
- But you were reborn.
- Oh, you're crazy.

398
00:46:56,498 --> 00:47:00,776
- You are a crazy cat lady.
- Midnight knew your fate.

399
00:47:02,498 --> 00:47:04,728
That's why she tested you.

400
00:47:07,298 --> 00:47:09,812
To see if you were worthy
of a gift she could give you.

401
00:47:10,298 --> 00:47:13,096
A gift that could change your life...

402
00:47:13,298 --> 00:47:15,368
...and give you a new one.

403
00:47:21,698 --> 00:47:26,726
You're not alone, child. He's saved
others before you. Look.

404
00:47:31,898 --> 00:47:35,174
Catwomen are not contained
by the rules of society.

405
00:47:36,698 --> 00:47:39,053
You follow your own desires.

406
00:47:39,698 --> 00:47:42,451
This is both a blessing and a curse.

407
00:47:42,698 --> 00:47:46,008
You will often be alone
and misunderstood.

408
00:47:46,298 --> 00:47:50,416
But you will experience a freedom
other women will never know.

409
00:47:50,498 --> 00:47:55,128
You are a catwoman.
Every sight, every smell...

410
00:47:55,298 --> 00:47:58,263
...every sound, incredibly heightened.

411
00:47:58,298 --> 00:48:04,009
Fierce independence, total confidence,
inhuman reflexes.

412
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:08,769
- So I'm not Patience anymore?
- You are Patience.

413
00:48:09,098 --> 00:48:11,532
And you are Catwoman.

414
00:48:20,498 --> 00:48:23,251
Accept it, child.

415
00:48:23,498 --> 00:48:26,171
You've spent a lifetime caged.

416
00:48:26,498 --> 00:48:30,855
By accepting who you are,
all of who you are...

417
00:48:31,898 --> 00:48:33,992
...you can be free.

418
00:48:34,027 --> 00:48:36,087
And freedom is power.

419
00:48:55,938 --> 00:48:58,532
You saved my life, Midnight.

420
00:48:58,938 --> 00:49:00,656
But somebody killed me...

421
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:05,294
...and I've got to find out who,
and why.

422
00:50:34,338 --> 00:50:36,329
You dealt with Slavicky?

423
00:50:36,738 --> 00:50:38,410
It's done.

424
00:51:09,738 --> 00:51:12,730
Oh, my God. We danced all night.

425
00:51:28,938 --> 00:51:31,657
- Been here all night.
- Absolutely.

426
00:51:31,938 --> 00:51:33,656
Keep the change.

427
00:51:38,538 --> 00:51:41,177
- What can I do for you?
- White Russian.

428
00:51:41,538 --> 00:51:45,690
No ice, hold the vodka, hold the Kahlua.

429
00:51:51,138 --> 00:51:53,208
Cream. Straight up.

430
00:53:18,418 --> 00:53:20,329
Looking for something?

431
00:53:51,418 --> 00:53:56,208
The other night you killed somebody.
She was a nice girl. Why?

432
00:53:58,618 --> 00:54:00,654
Cat got your tongue?

433
00:54:02,218 --> 00:54:06,211
I don't know. They told me to flush
the pipes so I flushed the pipes.

434
00:54:08,218 --> 00:54:10,288
- Why?
- I don't know why.

435
00:54:10,618 --> 00:54:13,007
Beau-line. There's something
wrong with Beau-line.

436
00:54:13,018 --> 00:54:15,418
She heard something
she wasn't supposed to hear.

437
00:54:15,453 --> 00:54:18,376
And Hedare is covering it up.

438
00:54:55,618 --> 00:54:58,655
I can't live with turning people
into monsters.

439
00:55:20,338 --> 00:55:22,010
Hey, hey, hey.

440
00:55:22,738 --> 00:55:24,330
Wow!

441
00:55:24,538 --> 00:55:26,449
You look amazing.

442
00:55:27,538 --> 00:55:28,971
- Do you like it?
- Love it.

443
00:55:29,338 --> 00:55:30,876
- Like the hair?
- Love the hair.

444
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:32,415
- Did good?
- You did real good.

445
00:55:32,938 --> 00:55:34,103
This guy is good for you.

446
00:55:34,138 --> 00:55:38,370
Aren't you glad I pushed you into it?
Props to Sally. Let me hear my props.

447
00:55:38,938 --> 00:55:40,212
- Props to Sally.
- Yeah.

448
00:55:40,738 --> 00:55:44,014
Clothes, and a treat.

449
00:55:46,138 --> 00:55:48,208
So are you gonna be okay, or what?

450
00:55:48,538 --> 00:55:52,372
I do feel better. That's maybe laying off
the Cosmos for a couple days.

451
00:55:52,738 --> 00:55:54,251
Check this out.

452
00:55:54,538 --> 00:55:57,291
Some chick in a cat suit
murdered Slavicky last night.

453
00:55:57,538 --> 00:56:01,138
The actions of this lunatic will not
keep Beau-line off the shelves.

454
00:56:01,173 --> 00:56:04,130
We will launch next week as planned...

455
00:56:04,738 --> 00:56:09,334
...because we owe it to the women
of this country.

456
00:56:09,538 --> 00:56:13,008
- Because-
- Please. That guy is so full of himself.

457
00:56:13,738 --> 00:56:15,888
- I'm almost out.
- Let's see.

458
00:56:16,138 --> 00:56:17,935
How long have you
been having headaches?

459
00:56:17,938 --> 00:56:19,735
- About a month.
- Do me a favor.

460
00:56:19,738 --> 00:56:21,171
- Stop using this.
- Why?

461
00:56:22,138 --> 00:56:25,130
Because it's making you sick. Trust me.

462
00:56:29,938 --> 00:56:33,135
Thank you, lieutenant.
You're gonna roll with him.

463
00:56:34,138 --> 00:56:36,891
For Tom, from forensics.

464
00:56:37,738 --> 00:56:40,810
Oh, and Slavicky homicide.
Maybe you'll want to look at that.

465
00:56:41,338 --> 00:56:43,568
Hey, Bob, let me ask you a question.

466
00:56:43,738 --> 00:56:47,174
Would your wife crawl out on the ledge
of a building to rescue a cat?

467
00:56:47,338 --> 00:56:49,488
Maybe, if the cat was carrying a pizza.

468
00:57:02,938 --> 00:57:04,703
Well, there are similarities.

469
00:57:04,738 --> 00:57:08,697
- Shape of the S, harsh stroke of the R's.
- Were they written by the same person?

470
00:57:08,938 --> 00:57:11,247
Well, it's not an exact science.

471
00:57:11,938 --> 00:57:16,138
But this first one. The broad spacing
of the letters? Indicative of loneliness.

472
00:57:16,173 --> 00:57:20,017
And the O reaching out, insecure.
Handwriting of a people-pleaser.

473
00:57:20,338 --> 00:57:22,727
Now, we look at the loop of the Y.

474
00:57:22,738 --> 00:57:25,127
Very self-confident, almost angry.

475
00:57:25,138 --> 00:57:28,335
And the O, well, this person
doesn't like to play by the rules.

476
00:57:28,738 --> 00:57:30,615
- So they're different people.
- Very.

477
00:57:31,138 --> 00:57:33,538
If you put these two women
in the same room...

478
00:57:33,573 --> 00:57:35,608
...you're gonna have one hell of a party.

479
00:57:37,138 --> 00:57:40,414
- You got a big weekend planned, Tom?
- I do now.

480
00:57:53,578 --> 00:57:55,614
Aren't you supposed to let me win?

481
00:57:55,978 --> 00:57:57,127
Not that kind of girl.

482
00:57:57,178 --> 00:57:59,897
- What kind of girl is that?
- A loser.

483
00:58:00,778 --> 00:58:02,434
Hey, can I ask you a question?

484
00:58:02,469 --> 00:58:04,091
You work for Hedare, right?

485
00:58:04,378 --> 00:58:07,450
Somebody was murdered at his factory
the other night.

486
00:58:09,178 --> 00:58:10,343
I'm sorry.

487
00:58:10,378 --> 00:58:13,654
Can you think of anybody who might
have a grudge against the company?

488
00:58:13,978 --> 00:58:17,857
Lots of people. George Hedare isn't
the nicest guy in the world, you know.

489
00:58:18,178 --> 00:58:19,975
He fired me.

490
00:58:22,378 --> 00:58:26,007
What? Am I a suspect now, detective?

491
00:58:30,178 --> 00:58:31,531
No.

492
00:58:50,578 --> 00:58:52,694
Looks like we'll be
up here for a while.

493
00:58:54,778 --> 00:58:56,496
You in a hurry?

494
00:59:16,378 --> 00:59:17,731
Mom!

495
00:59:27,778 --> 00:59:29,973
- Hey!
- Don't move!

496
00:59:30,178 --> 00:59:32,533
Hold on tight. I gotta stop this thing.

497
00:59:38,578 --> 00:59:40,489
- Mom!
- Frankie.

498
00:59:44,578 --> 00:59:46,136
Mom! Mom!

499
00:59:46,378 --> 00:59:48,448
Help, Mom!

500
00:59:49,978 --> 00:59:51,127
Mom!

501
00:59:55,978 --> 00:59:59,015
Help, Mom! Help! Help!

502
01:00:28,378 --> 01:00:31,378
You are one tough little guy,
you know that?

503
01:00:31,413 --> 01:00:33,687
- Take it easy, partner.
- Bye.

504
01:00:37,978 --> 01:00:39,696
It's over.

505
01:00:39,778 --> 01:00:43,134
Well, I'm not sure how you did it,
but I'm impressed.

506
01:00:43,378 --> 01:00:46,609
Well, I saw how you did. And so am I.

507
01:00:46,978 --> 01:00:48,411
- You know what?
- What?

508
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:52,373
We should celebrate. Why don't you
let me take you to dinner tonight?

509
01:00:52,378 --> 01:00:55,927
I would love to, but I can't.
Not tonight. I've got...

510
01:00:56,578 --> 01:01:00,207
...some business
that I have to take care of.

511
01:01:56,098 --> 01:01:58,658
You picked the wrong house.

512
01:02:01,498 --> 01:02:03,329
You're the cat that killed Slavicky.

513
01:02:03,898 --> 01:02:06,298
You don't believe everything
you see on TV, do you?

514
01:02:06,333 --> 01:02:08,892
- What do you want?
- Your husband. Is he home?

515
01:02:09,298 --> 01:02:11,448
I'm here. Why on earth
would he be home?

516
01:02:11,698 --> 01:02:13,211
Oh, too bad.

517
01:02:18,898 --> 01:02:22,413
If your husband ever comes home,
tell him I know all about Beau-line.

518
01:02:23,098 --> 01:02:26,408
It's disease in a jar.
I wouldn't caulk a sink with it.

519
01:02:26,698 --> 01:02:30,863
- Come on. I've been using it for years.
- It's your funeral.

520
01:02:30,898 --> 01:02:35,016
Because whoever killed Slavicky did it
to keep Beau-line's toxic little secret.

521
01:02:35,098 --> 01:02:38,408
Are you suggesting that my husband
is a murderer?

522
01:02:38,698 --> 01:02:40,654
I'm suggesting that
you tell me where he is.

523
01:02:41,098 --> 01:02:43,612
- So I'll ask him myself.
- I suppose I should be shocked.

524
01:02:44,098 --> 01:02:47,295
Protest his innocence. But the truth is...

525
01:02:48,298 --> 01:02:50,050
...that man's capable of anything.

526
01:02:50,698 --> 01:02:52,370
You wanna find him?

527
01:02:54,298 --> 01:02:55,811
There he is.

528
01:03:00,898 --> 01:03:03,287
- Thanks.
- I'd like to help.

529
01:03:03,898 --> 01:03:05,214
How can I reach you?

530
01:03:05,249 --> 01:03:06,531
I'm not exactly listed.

531
01:03:06,898 --> 01:03:08,456
Take my phone.

532
01:03:42,938 --> 01:03:46,010
Call the cops.
You're not going to believe this.

533
01:03:46,538 --> 01:03:48,574
I think this is a total waste of time.

534
01:03:48,938 --> 01:03:51,247
- Don't.
- What?

535
01:03:51,938 --> 01:03:53,417
Think. Ever.

536
01:03:54,338 --> 01:03:56,977
Consider it a condition
of our relationship.

537
01:04:06,338 --> 01:04:08,727
I love this part.

538
01:04:11,138 --> 01:04:13,732
- Who the hell-?
- Like my nails?

539
01:04:15,338 --> 01:04:17,010
Just got them done.

540
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:20,212
My bad.

541
01:04:21,938 --> 01:04:23,929
Get your paws off me this instant!

542
01:04:24,338 --> 01:04:26,693
I know about Beau-line,
and your cover-up.

543
01:04:27,338 --> 01:04:28,327
What?

544
01:04:29,138 --> 01:04:31,811
So did my girl, Patience.
That's why you killed her.

545
01:04:32,138 --> 01:04:35,738
- What? I didn't kill her-
- Too bad your last words will be a lie.

546
01:04:35,773 --> 01:04:37,330
Freeze!

547
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:02,132
Hey!

548
01:05:02,738 --> 01:05:05,491
Hold it right there.
Don't you move.

549
01:05:05,738 --> 01:05:07,888
Now, come down from there
nice and easy.

550
01:05:08,138 --> 01:05:10,936
Cats come when they feel like it.

551
01:05:11,738 --> 01:05:13,330
Not when they're told.

552
01:05:13,538 --> 01:05:16,769
I won't tell you again. You turn around.
Hands on your head.

553
01:05:36,338 --> 01:05:37,737
You're under arrest.

554
01:05:53,138 --> 01:05:54,457
Gotcha!

555
01:05:57,338 --> 01:05:59,703
- You think this is a game?
- Now we're playing.

556
01:05:59,738 --> 01:06:03,253
- You're playing. I'm at work.
- Seems like you love your job.

557
01:06:06,938 --> 01:06:10,169
- Don't I get din-din first?
- I'll feed you in your cell.

558
01:06:27,938 --> 01:06:30,168
Careful. That cable hits us,
we're both fried.

559
01:06:30,338 --> 01:06:32,568
I knew I felt a spark between us.

560
01:06:38,138 --> 01:06:41,138
- Not on the first date.
- Don't flatter yourself. I'm taken.

561
01:06:41,173 --> 01:06:42,412
Does she know about us?

562
01:06:42,938 --> 01:06:44,212
There's no "us."

563
01:06:45,938 --> 01:06:47,656
Too bad.

564
01:06:51,338 --> 01:06:52,771
It's over.

565
01:07:05,138 --> 01:07:06,457
There she is.

566
01:07:07,538 --> 01:07:08,937
Okay, boys.

567
01:07:09,338 --> 01:07:12,011
Show of hands.
Who can see in the dark?

568
01:07:14,138 --> 01:07:15,127
I can.

569
01:07:23,098 --> 01:07:27,250
But this is a disaster!
It's a total bloody disaster.

570
01:07:29,098 --> 01:07:33,296
How does she know all this?
Who is she, anyway? And how come-?

571
01:07:33,898 --> 01:07:35,092
It's all right.

572
01:07:35,698 --> 01:07:37,211
Don't be scared.

573
01:07:39,298 --> 01:07:44,008
Great. You haven't got a clue, do you?
We are in absolute ruin here...

574
01:07:44,098 --> 01:07:47,647
...and your brilliant piece of advice
to me is: "Don't be scared"?

575
01:07:47,698 --> 01:07:51,657
No. My advice to you, George...

576
01:07:52,498 --> 01:07:53,663
...quit the self-tanning.

577
01:07:53,698 --> 01:07:56,063
Stop eating Viagra like they're vitamins.

578
01:07:56,098 --> 01:08:00,808
Resist the urge to date children born the
same day they invented the cell phone.

579
01:08:01,498 --> 01:08:05,127
For once, George,
in your miserable life...

580
01:08:06,298 --> 01:08:07,526
...be a man!

581
01:08:17,698 --> 01:08:18,863
Terrific.

582
01:08:18,898 --> 01:08:21,287
Beau-line works wonders, doesn't it?

583
01:08:21,898 --> 01:08:24,412
Okay, Sal. What do you think?

584
01:08:27,898 --> 01:08:30,776
I don't know. You going to a church
or a Playboy mansion?

585
01:08:30,898 --> 01:08:32,456
Well, that was helpful.

586
01:08:33,298 --> 01:08:35,414
I'm such a freak.

587
01:08:35,698 --> 01:08:39,134
Please, I'm a freak Thursday
through Sunday, big deal.

588
01:08:39,298 --> 01:08:41,766
Okay, but what if he doesn't like...

589
01:08:42,298 --> 01:08:45,210
...the real me?
- He can't pick and choose, Patience.

590
01:08:45,298 --> 01:08:48,893
If he wants this to work,
he's gonna have to like all of you.

591
01:08:59,098 --> 01:09:02,215
- Senora Hedare. Perdon.
- Go.

592
01:09:11,098 --> 01:09:12,326
Pretty.

593
01:09:13,498 --> 01:09:15,056
- Thanks.
- Oh, you too.

594
01:09:15,298 --> 01:09:17,448
But I was talking about the fish.

595
01:09:18,898 --> 01:09:20,616
Detective work is like dating.

596
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:24,452
It's all about the pursuit.
But when you catch them-

597
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:31,450
You like your sushi, huh?

598
01:09:33,898 --> 01:09:35,331
That's good.

599
01:09:39,898 --> 01:09:42,651
So tell me about this one...

600
01:09:43,498 --> 01:09:44,931
...that got away.

601
01:09:45,298 --> 01:09:46,526
Catwoman.

602
01:09:47,098 --> 01:09:51,569
- You heard of her?
- Oh, yeah. Hot, black leather, whip.

603
01:09:51,898 --> 01:09:53,570
She kissed me.

604
01:09:54,298 --> 01:09:56,493
- Really?
- Yeah.

605
01:09:56,698 --> 01:09:59,690
- What do you think about that?
- Depends.

606
01:10:00,298 --> 01:10:03,290
- You like bad girls?
- Only if they like me back.

607
01:10:06,298 --> 01:10:09,176
No, listen, bad isn't something
that does it for me.

608
01:10:09,298 --> 01:10:12,813
Okay, bad, good.
Gotta be something in between, right?

609
01:10:13,498 --> 01:10:16,251
Maybe it's a little more complicated.

610
01:10:16,498 --> 01:10:19,410
- Why don't we talk about you?
- Okay.

611
01:10:20,098 --> 01:10:23,568
- What's it like to be an artist?
- Well, I'm not really an artist.

612
01:10:23,698 --> 01:10:26,531
I mean, yeah, I did go to art school...

613
01:10:26,698 --> 01:10:30,486
...but then I got a regular job
at an advertising agency...

614
01:10:31,498 --> 01:10:36,936
...and now I don't really know
what I am anymore.

615
01:10:39,898 --> 01:10:41,490
Well, I know what you are.

616
01:10:42,898 --> 01:10:44,570
You're different.

617
01:10:45,298 --> 01:10:46,811
You're special.

618
01:10:48,898 --> 01:10:51,298
- And I like that about you.
- Thanks.

619
01:10:51,333 --> 01:10:52,777
No, it's true.

620
01:10:54,898 --> 01:10:56,854
And I want to know more about you.

621
01:10:59,098 --> 01:11:00,087
You know...

622
01:11:00,818 --> 01:11:03,093
...I guess there's a few things
I need to explain.

623
01:11:03,218 --> 01:11:05,812
Like what, your new look? Huh?

624
01:11:06,218 --> 01:11:10,006
- Your dunk shot?
- No, that's not what I was thinking.

625
01:11:10,418 --> 01:11:11,692
Hey.

626
01:11:14,018 --> 01:11:15,770
You can tell me anything.

627
01:11:23,018 --> 01:11:24,815
I'm...

628
01:11:33,818 --> 01:11:35,410
I hate the rain!

629
01:11:45,818 --> 01:11:47,456
What were you saying?

630
01:11:50,018 --> 01:11:51,815
Nothing important.

631
01:13:22,418 --> 01:13:23,771
Tom?

632
01:13:32,018 --> 01:13:33,417
It's me.

633
01:13:34,418 --> 01:13:36,409
You were right about Beau-line's secrets.

634
01:13:36,818 --> 01:13:41,016
I can't believe it, but you were right.
Beau-line is toxic.

635
01:13:41,018 --> 01:13:45,216
I have proof. We can stop him,
but we have to stop him together.

636
01:13:45,218 --> 01:13:49,097
George will be launching Beau-line
at a press conference tomorrow.

637
01:13:49,418 --> 01:13:51,978
Beau-line will be on the shelves
on Monday.

638
01:14:39,938 --> 01:14:41,132
So, what'd you find?

639
01:14:41,138 --> 01:14:45,495
Enough evidence to put someone away
for a long, long time.

640
01:14:46,538 --> 01:14:49,530
I was everything they wanted me to be.

641
01:14:50,138 --> 01:14:52,857
I was never more beautiful.

642
01:14:53,138 --> 01:14:55,015
Never more powerful.

643
01:14:55,538 --> 01:14:59,133
And then I turned 40
and they threw me away.

644
01:15:02,138 --> 01:15:04,493
It's all there behind the desk.

645
01:15:18,338 --> 01:15:19,657
How'd I do?

646
01:15:20,138 --> 01:15:24,256
The clawed-flesh thing
was a little tricky...

647
01:15:24,338 --> 01:15:26,249
...but I think I pulled it off.

648
01:15:30,938 --> 01:15:34,248
- You killed him?
- No one is gonna stop Beau-line...

649
01:15:34,538 --> 01:15:36,335
...from hitting the shelves.

650
01:15:36,338 --> 01:15:37,851
Not Slavicky.

651
01:15:38,738 --> 01:15:42,333
Not George. And certainly not you.

652
01:15:43,538 --> 01:15:46,336
I'm sorry. I'm forgetting my manners.

653
01:15:46,538 --> 01:15:48,376
Can I offer you something?

654
01:15:48,411 --> 01:15:50,215
Can of tuna? Saucer of milk?

655
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:56,935
Smoking gun? Which, sweetheart, you
just emptied into my husband's chest.

656
01:16:00,338 --> 01:16:02,329
Oh, George!

657
01:16:02,738 --> 01:16:06,970
Help, somebody help!
It's Catwoman! She killed George.

658
01:16:08,138 --> 01:16:09,810
Oh, my God!

659
01:17:20,338 --> 01:17:21,771
Patience.

660
01:17:29,338 --> 01:17:30,851
I'm sorry.

661
01:17:37,138 --> 01:17:40,733
I guess you could take this right
out of my hands if you wanted.

662
01:17:45,538 --> 01:17:46,971
If I wanted.

663
01:17:55,738 --> 01:17:59,333
I'm telling you, Slavicky had evidence
that Beau-line was toxic.

664
01:17:59,938 --> 01:18:01,610
That's why Laurel killed him.

665
01:18:01,738 --> 01:18:05,174
George found out and she killed him too.
She was covering it up.

666
01:18:05,338 --> 01:18:08,853
Ballistics show the same weapon killed
both men: The gun in your hand.

667
01:18:08,938 --> 01:18:12,010
- Catwoman's hand.
- What's the difference?

668
01:18:13,738 --> 01:18:16,855
- Guess it doesn't matter.
- Don't you understand?

669
01:18:17,338 --> 01:18:21,172
All of the evidence, every single piece,
it points to you.

670
01:18:21,538 --> 01:18:23,927
There's nothing that shows me
anything else.

671
01:18:25,138 --> 01:18:26,491
There's me.

672
01:18:27,538 --> 01:18:29,290
You can believe me.

673
01:18:35,938 --> 01:18:38,498
Do you remember the first time
you saw me?

674
01:18:39,538 --> 01:18:40,687
Yeah.

675
01:18:41,338 --> 01:18:42,976
What did you see?

676
01:18:43,138 --> 01:18:44,412
A girl...

677
01:18:44,938 --> 01:18:46,417
...rescuing a cat.

678
01:18:46,738 --> 01:18:48,091
No, you didn't.

679
01:18:49,138 --> 01:18:53,370
You saw a crazy person out on a ledge
trying to jump.

680
01:18:55,138 --> 01:18:59,495
And all the evidence pointed to that,
didn't it?

681
01:18:59,938 --> 01:19:02,498
I really need you to believe me.

682
01:19:07,138 --> 01:19:08,651
How can I?

683
01:19:10,138 --> 01:19:11,969
I don't know who you are.

684
01:19:16,738 --> 01:19:19,536
I'm the same girl
you were with last night.

685
01:19:36,538 --> 01:19:38,176
Take her back.

686
01:19:51,538 --> 01:19:53,210
You be a nice kitty, now.

687
01:20:16,738 --> 01:20:18,490
Look at it this way, Lone.

688
01:20:19,138 --> 01:20:22,335
You may have lost your woman,
but at least you got your man.

689
01:20:24,538 --> 01:20:25,766
Did I?

690
01:20:26,338 --> 01:20:27,487
Yeah.

691
01:20:33,098 --> 01:20:34,850
Hello, Midnight.

692
01:20:54,098 --> 01:20:56,293
You've spent a lifetime caged.

693
01:20:56,498 --> 01:21:00,616
By accepting who you are,
all of who you are...

694
01:21:01,298 --> 01:21:02,777
...you can be free.

695
01:21:03,098 --> 01:21:04,816
And freedom is power.

696
01:21:07,898 --> 01:21:10,128
It's not just about me
anymore, Midnight.

697
01:21:20,498 --> 01:21:21,897
You know...

698
01:21:22,298 --> 01:21:25,131
...Lassie would have brought me a key.

699
01:21:25,898 --> 01:21:27,570
Cross your paws.

700
01:21:55,298 --> 01:21:58,290
- We' re gonna shift-change in half an hour.
- All right.

701
01:22:01,298 --> 01:22:04,051
- Dave's gonna take over then?
- Yeah, as far as I know.

702
01:22:04,298 --> 01:22:06,129
Yeah, right through here, pal.

703
01:22:07,298 --> 01:22:09,528
You'll get to talk to a lawyer.

704
01:22:29,498 --> 01:22:30,647
Are you okay?

705
01:22:30,698 --> 01:22:33,496
A girl like me lands on her feet.

706
01:22:34,898 --> 01:22:36,809
Wait! Wait!

707
01:22:46,578 --> 01:22:48,773
My husband dreamed of a world...

708
01:22:48,978 --> 01:22:52,288
...where every woman could be
as beautiful as she wanted to be.

709
01:22:53,178 --> 01:22:58,578
He dedicated his life pursuing that dream.
As Hedare's new chief executive...

710
01:22:58,613 --> 01:23:01,650
...I intend to make that dream a reality...

711
01:23:02,178 --> 01:23:06,888
...by proceeding with tomorrow's launch
of Beau-line.

712
01:23:13,578 --> 01:23:14,897
Thank you!

713
01:23:18,978 --> 01:23:23,017
Thank you so much. I have been dying
to get some of this stuff.

714
01:23:23,178 --> 01:23:27,330
My husband would have wanted you
to have it. He wanted that for everyone.

715
01:23:29,178 --> 01:23:32,409
- Detective Lone. What a surprise.
- Yeah?

716
01:23:32,778 --> 01:23:38,057
Everyone, this is the man that brought
my husband's killer to justice.

717
01:23:41,178 --> 01:23:42,930
Can I talk to you, in private?

718
01:23:42,978 --> 01:23:45,208
Come upstairs to my office.

719
01:23:53,778 --> 01:23:56,178
- Number five, ready to go.
- Yeah, yeah.

720
01:23:56,213 --> 01:23:58,294
Yeah, go ahead. Right there.

721
01:24:07,578 --> 01:24:10,012
Get a move on.
Gotta meet that midnight delivery.

722
01:24:46,618 --> 01:24:49,618
I saw her standing over him.
There were claw marks all over his body.

723
01:24:49,653 --> 01:24:52,371
- But not on Slavicky's.
- Because she didn't have the time.

724
01:24:52,618 --> 01:24:54,574
She also didn't have a motive.

725
01:24:56,218 --> 01:24:58,812
- I don't know.
- What if I told you I know the truth?

726
01:24:59,218 --> 01:25:01,937
That I know who killed your husband,
I know about Beau-line.

727
01:25:02,218 --> 01:25:05,574
Why, detective, you make it sound
like I'm a suspect.

728
01:25:06,418 --> 01:25:08,932
What if I told you I had evidence?

729
01:25:10,618 --> 01:25:14,777
If you have evidence,
then how come I'm not in cuffs?

730
01:25:14,812 --> 01:25:18,936
Well, you're a smart woman,
Mrs. Hedare. Beautiful. Rich.

731
01:25:19,618 --> 01:25:21,688
I thought maybe we could
work something out.

732
01:25:22,018 --> 01:25:27,046
So this evidence... You'll make it
disappear? Pin it on the other girl?

733
01:25:27,418 --> 01:25:29,648
If that's what you want me to do.

734
01:25:30,418 --> 01:25:31,583
And you?

735
01:25:31,618 --> 01:25:34,530
- What do you want?
- You just gave me what I want.

736
01:25:34,618 --> 01:25:36,495
You just told me it was you.

737
01:25:37,618 --> 01:25:40,291
Now, why would you believe it was me?

738
01:25:41,818 --> 01:25:43,376
Because I finally trusted a friend.

739
01:25:43,618 --> 01:25:46,132
Yeah, well, your friend
just got you killed.

740
01:25:47,818 --> 01:25:50,776
Don't be stupid, Laurel.
You don't want to kill a cop.

741
01:25:51,418 --> 01:25:53,374
I'm a woman, Lone.

742
01:25:54,418 --> 01:25:57,808
I'm used to doing all kinds
of things I don't wanna do.

743
01:25:58,018 --> 01:26:00,088
Give my regards to my husband.

744
01:26:06,418 --> 01:26:07,976
How sweet.

745
01:26:08,218 --> 01:26:10,686
Thanks. Now I can kill you both.

746
01:26:29,818 --> 01:26:31,809
Hold on, I gotta stop.

747
01:26:33,418 --> 01:26:34,612
How is it?

748
01:26:34,618 --> 01:26:36,495
Well, there goes my jump shot.

749
01:26:37,018 --> 01:26:38,167
Listen.

750
01:26:38,218 --> 01:26:40,288
I want you to know I'm sorry.

751
01:26:40,618 --> 01:26:42,813
I should have trusted you all along.

752
01:26:43,018 --> 01:26:45,612
You're confusing me
with somebody else.

753
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:48,256
Come on, Patience.

754
01:26:53,818 --> 01:26:55,092
I'll take this side.

755
01:27:51,218 --> 01:27:53,686
I can't believe I ever trusted you.

756
01:27:54,218 --> 01:27:57,369
- You're a fake.
- And what are you? A hero?

757
01:27:59,618 --> 01:28:00,971
A thief?

758
01:28:02,618 --> 01:28:04,017
A freak?

759
01:28:08,618 --> 01:28:12,008
If you don't have an identity,
why keep it a secret?

760
01:28:12,818 --> 01:28:15,252
Because you killed me.

761
01:28:20,018 --> 01:28:22,896
It was me you flushed down the pipes.

762
01:28:26,018 --> 01:28:27,736
I'm Patience Phillips.

763
01:28:29,018 --> 01:28:30,610
That's who's under there?

764
01:29:02,018 --> 01:29:03,974
- I can't be hurt.
- Beau-line.

765
01:29:04,418 --> 01:29:07,649
You stop using it
and your face disintegrates.

766
01:29:11,618 --> 01:29:15,691
And if you keep using it,
skin like living marble.

767
01:29:21,818 --> 01:29:23,888
And you can't feel a thing.

768
01:29:54,818 --> 01:29:58,208
You're just a scared little girl
playing dress-up.

769
01:30:02,618 --> 01:30:04,848
Nobody. Nothing.

770
01:30:11,018 --> 01:30:13,054
Where do you think you're going?

771
01:30:15,818 --> 01:30:18,013
You're gonna look like a cop-killer.

772
01:30:18,218 --> 01:30:22,530
You wanted to save him.
Honey, you couldn't save yourself.

773
01:30:36,818 --> 01:30:38,171
Game over.

774
01:30:39,218 --> 01:30:40,571
Guess what.

775
01:30:41,618 --> 01:30:43,654
It's overtime.

776
01:31:26,618 --> 01:31:28,051
Give me your hand!

777
01:31:30,818 --> 01:31:32,046
Help me!

778
01:32:00,818 --> 01:32:05,016
I might not be a hero,
but I'm certainly not a killer.

779
01:32:08,618 --> 01:32:09,937
You know...

780
01:32:10,418 --> 01:32:12,170
...once Laurel's boys start talking...

781
01:32:12,818 --> 01:32:15,491
...we'll be able to wrap up
these murder cases pretty easy.

782
01:32:17,018 --> 01:32:20,374
And if Patience is back in her cell
by tomorrow morning...

783
01:32:21,218 --> 01:32:24,176
...it'll be awfully tough to prove
that she was Catwoman.

784
01:32:26,618 --> 01:32:28,131
Exactly.

785
01:32:56,538 --> 01:32:58,654
Delicious, thank you.

786
01:32:59,538 --> 01:33:01,768
You know, the strawberry was good too.

787
01:33:12,138 --> 01:33:14,652
The day I died
was the day I started to live.

788
01:33:16,938 --> 01:33:20,538
In my old life, I longed for someone
to see what was special in me.

789
01:33:20,573 --> 01:33:25,009
You did, and for that
you'll always be in my heart.

790
01:33:25,338 --> 01:33:28,296
But what I really needed
was for me to see it.

791
01:33:28,938 --> 01:33:30,496
And now I do.

792
01:33:30,738 --> 01:33:32,251
You 're a good man, Tom.

793
01:33:32,538 --> 01:33:36,738
But you live in a world that has no place
for someone like me.

794
01:33:36,773 --> 01:33:40,208
You see, sometimes I'm good.
Oh, I'm very good.

795
01:33:40,338 --> 01:33:44,047
But sometimes I'm bad.
But only as bad as I wanna be.

796
01:33:44,538 --> 01:33:46,017
Freedom is power.

797
01:33:46,338 --> 01:33:51,696
To live a life untamed and unafraid
is the gift that I've been given...

798
01:33:51,738 --> 01:33:54,889
...and so my journey begins.

799
01:39:37,778 --> 01:39:39,578
