3
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,310
I saw this image when I was a kid.

4
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:01,654
The photograph of Jupiter
taken by NASA's Voyager.

5
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,072
Beautiful

6
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:07,321
but nothing special
until shown in rapid succession.

7
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:14,332
Suddenly Jupiter was alive,

8
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:15,751
breathing.

9
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,329
I was hypnotized

10
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:38,562
I was 17 when I got
my acceptance letter to MIT.

11
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,438
- One, two, three, MIT!
- Okay. Wait...

12
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:44,947
I felt like anything was possible.

13
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:48,492
I don't want to eat
the apple of cynicism.

14
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,700
And it was.

15
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,511
♪Flava♪ ♪Flava♪

16
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,392
♪Flava♪ ♪Flava♪

17
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,725
- Yo, what's up, baby?
- It's your boy Flava- F-L-A-V-A.

18
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,560
Thatis your dude
with the big mouth! Yo!

19
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,193
I don't know if you heard the news,
but the scientists say...

20
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:29,320
They just discovered
another planet super close to us...

21
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,948
with the conditions
that could support life?

22
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:35,998
Really? Well, now it's visible
up in the night sky.

23
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:40,123
They say if you look just east
of the North Star, you'll see it.

24
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:41,829
It's a litte blue spot.

25
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:45,007
I want all you lovers out there
to make a wish...

26
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,959
on a tiny blue star...

27
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:50,296
as I play this hot joint for you
right now.

28
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,223
It's your boy Flava!

29
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:04,859
That's easy.

30
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:08,565
What rhymes with... “honey”?

31
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,200
He's like, “AII
right, enough with it!”.

32
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,323
What rhymes-
Let's do some animals.

33
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:15,996
- You wanna give him some animals?
- Yeah.

34
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:19,416
What rhymes
with- “Lion”?

35
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,209
Oh, my gosh.

36
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,704
- “Pion.
- ” A pion.

37
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:27,963
A small puma of the high Himalayas.

38
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,294
Did we figure out
what this guy's name is?

39
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,093
Bob.
Bob the robot.

40
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,765
He looks to me like a Bob.

41
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,468
Go ahead.

42
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,771
Feel her.

43
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,598
She's in there, all right.

44
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,524
I hope so.

45
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:50,606
What rhymes with...

46
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,861
“light”?

47
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,817
- “Light"?
- Oh, that's a good one.

48
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:03,197
And by all
appearances, the, uh, planet...

49
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,907
Seems to be a mirror to our own,

50
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,413
from the continental structures
to the oceans.

51
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,961
Even their cities are our cities.

52
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,038
And where are
we in terms of Communication?

53
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,715
That's exactly my point.

54
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,713
If this planet is sustaining
intelligent life...

55
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,294
of comparable
levels to our own...

56
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,879
That's a very significant point.

57
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,306
So far we have nothing.
We have a jumble of radio signals,

58
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,224
the strongest of which
are military radars.

59
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,180
But even those radio signals are not
something we can parse out and understand.

60
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,557
- We don't.
- Even know it really exists.

61
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,313
It could be some
cosmic mirror of sorts.

62
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,645
You've written
extensively about that ..

63
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:38,858
As the most likely explanation for why
it's identical to our own planet.

64
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,613
This planet exists.

65
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,866
It has mass and it has
a clearly detectable orbit.

66
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,323
It's even having radio signals.

67
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,619
So did you have a crew
on the inside?

68
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,496
Do you have any tattoos?

69
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,369
- Jeffrey!
- I'm just asking.

70
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:42,304
You hear about that guy who's having
the contest to go to the other Earth?

71
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,177
I mean, it's so stupid.

72
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:48,226
They're gonna get sucked
into a black star and die.

73
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,351
Hmm.

74
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,479
Is it good to be home?

75
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:37,809
Yeah.

76
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,486
You know,
if you need anything...

77
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,699
Oh. Towels.

78
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,790
Night.

79
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,169
Good night, Mom.

80
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,276
Three, two, one.

81
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,944
Booster ignition, and liftoff.

82
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,819
This will be
a trip like no other.

83
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:29,825
We will give those that travel with us
a unique and life-changing experience.

84
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:33,077
Travel to Earth Two.
Now booking.

85
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,935
I was thinking I would like
to do something with my hands.

86
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:43,484
You know, maybe-
maybe outdoors, maybe not.

87
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,313
Come on. I mean, you could
do something with your hands,

88
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:50,242
but you have such a great mind.

89
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:55,163
I don't wanna really be around too
many people or do too much talking.

90
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,117
All right.

91
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,752
Well, there's a maintenance position
open at West Haven High School.

92
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:17,765
Just imagine that you're a sleep
and then you wake.

93
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,517
You're not sure where you are.

94
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,815
You're not sure
if anyone else is around.

95
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,938
What would you probably do first?

96
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:28,113
You likely would look around
and say, "Hello?"

97
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,690
Hello?”.

98
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,946
You're attempting to find,
"Am I alone?”."

99
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,620
We here on Earth
would like to know.

100
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,289
Me and Rob got into this
huge, stupid fight last night.

101
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,991
Really? About what?

102
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,327
- I don't know.
- We were hanging out, and he just started fighting...

103
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,787
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

104
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,836
What are you guys doing?
Um, skipping Chemistry.

105
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,883
- Really?
- Yeah.

106
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,801
Guess who just texted me.

107
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,881
Who? Kyle.

108
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,261
Is he gonna pick us up?

109
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,897
Yo! It's the winter solstice.

110
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,225
That's right.
The shortest day of the year,

111
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:09,859
which means it will also be
the longest night of the year.

112
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,361
So take advantage.
You know what I'm talking about.

113
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:18,580
Also, today marks the anniversary of the
discovery of Earth Two a few years back.

114
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,749
Can you remember
what you were doing that night?

115
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,245
I know I remember.

116
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:26,250
I met this girl from Bridgeport...

117
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,423
That had a thing for the Flava!

118
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,592
Thatis right, baby.
You know how we do.

119
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,716
Baby if you're still out there,
boo, holler at your boy.

120
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,923
Flava, F-L-A-V-A. Yeah.

121
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,224
Not onLy do I got a big mouth,
I got a- Uh.

122
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,142
You know my number
Call me. Mmm.

123
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:51,052
Company that's underwriting
civilian travel to Earth Two

124
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,350
Keith, with all the risks...

125
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,399
and all the unknowns,
why are you doing this?

126
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:59,068
I don't think
governments should dictate exploration.

127
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:02,363
And I don't think we should
automaticaly ban average citizens...

128
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,738
From being the first to see
this new world.

129
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:35,396
When early explorers first
set out west across the Atlantic,

130
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,850
most people thought
the world was flat.

131
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:43,029
Most people thought
If you sailed far enough west.

132
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,653
You would drop off a plane
into nothing.

133
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,071
These vessels sailing out
into the unknown...

134
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:56,876
they weren't carrying noblemen
or aristocrats, artists, merchants.

135
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:03,383
They were crewed by people
living on the edge of life.

136
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:08,805
The madmen, orphans,
ex-convicts, outcasts...

137
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,506
like myself.

138
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:17,726
As a felon, I'm an unlikely
candidate for most things.

139
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,811
But perhaps not for this.

140
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,531
Perhaps I am the most likely.

141
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,858
Rhoda?

142
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,560
Hi. Alex.

143
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:09,031
I know who you are.

144
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,450
How are you?
How- How is everything?

145
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,571
It's great.

146
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,620
You celebrating?

147
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,827
Yeah. I just got into
business school.

148
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,127
Boston.

149
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:25,173
Hey, I couldn't get arugula,
but I found this spring mix.

150
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:28,376
That's good. Uh, this is Rhoda, an
old friend of mine from high school.

151
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,211
Oh, hi.
Hi.

152
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,092
I'm Claire.
Hi.

153
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,842
So, are you working?

154
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,802
West Haven High.

155
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,683
Yeah? What do you teach?

156
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:42,557
I clean.
What?

157
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,517
I clean the school.

158
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,444
Oh, that's cool.
That's probably very therapeutic.

159
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:53,443
All right. Well, it was
good to see you, Rhoda.

160
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,028
Yeah, it was nice to meet you.

161
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,035
Nice to meet you.

162
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:16,591
How do you know her?

163
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,142
High school.

164
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,025
Yeah?

165
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,821
Mr. Burroughs?
Mm-hmm.

166
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,198
I, uh...

167
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,912
What?
Came to...

168
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,416
I came to tell you about...

169
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,004
What?

170
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:33,626
Tell you about a tri- a free trial
of our cleaning service.

171
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,801
What?

172
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,879
I'm from Maid In Haven.

173
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,760
We're a cleaning service.

174
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:41,760
We're looking to expand our
territory and our- No, thank you.

175
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,396
Wait.

176
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,697
Did you say “trial cleaning”?

177
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,947
Did you say “trial cleaning”?
Yeah...

178
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,324
God.
Sorry, it's a t...

179
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,075
Is it definitely free?
Yeah.

180
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,831
Fine. Let's go.

181
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,253
Come on.

182
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,849
Come on.
You can start in here.

183
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,863
Did you say “Maid In Haven”?

184
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,612
Yes.
Like New Haven?

185
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:44,701
Yes.

186
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,409
You're pretty far from New Haven.

187
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,088
There's a lot
of competition in town,

188
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,790
so we're offering
the free trial as a...

189
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,592
Where are your supplies?

190
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,714
Uh, normally, the first time
is a consultation.

191
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,842
Okay.

192
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,803
Well, you're already here,
so why don't you just...

193
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,727
clean this for a start?

194
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,434
Okay? There's mops
and things in there.

195
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,020
Okay.

196
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,821
I'm gonna be in that room.

197
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,520
Is everything okay?
Yes.

198
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,620
Scientists have said
there is overwhelming evidence

199
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:50,915
that the two Earths...

200
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:35,121
- All right, that's enough.
- It's time for you to go.

201
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,629
So- Wait.
Is that it for the free trial?

202
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,385
Yeah, it's a one-day trial.

203
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:51,843
Um, all right.
So I'll see you next week.

204
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:57,064
I'll let them know.
They might send someone else.

205
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:59,434
Okay.
Same time, same...

206
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,315
Yeah, this is a good time.
This is a good day too.

207
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,987
So, Jeff, I think we've got
a pretty important toast in order.

208
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:48,233
What do you think, huh?
Hey, hey, hey! Hold on, hold on!

209
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:51,406
I just got the cider.
Come on, guys, it's not that big of a deal.

210
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:54,622
Oh!
It is a big deal.

211
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:58,041
You've shown perseverance
in the face of adversity.

212
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,957
You deserve to be saluted for that, Son.

213
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,465
Come on, Rho-tard.
Aren't you gonna ask what happened?

214
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,175
What happened?

215
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:14,725
- I got into UConn.
- And we are so proud of you!

216
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,302
Hear, hear!

217
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:17,887
Chin-chin!

218
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,566
Mr. Burroughs?

219
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:37,073
I came to tell you that I saw you
at the site of the accident.

220
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,829
And I'm sorry for what happened
to you and your family.

221
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,000
It was my fault.

222
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:54,056
Mr. Burroughs.

223
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,809
Oh. Good.
Mr. Burroughs.

224
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,223
I-
Come on in.

225
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:00,976
You can start where you finished.

226
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,056
I was wondering if I could
talk with you about something.

227
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,110
Not now. A little bit later.

228
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,890
I'm finished.

229
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:03,685
Check's on the kitchen table.

230
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,632
We're not real.
W-We're not real.

231
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:40,214
We're a projection of the
imagination of Earth Two.

232
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,097
Hmm.

233
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:03,847
This is Dr. Joan Tallis
of SETI,

234
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,300
the United States,
planet Earth.

235
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:08,056
Do you read me?

236
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,605
This is Dr. Joan Tallis of SETI,

237
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:19,063
the United States,
planet Earth.

238
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:20,489
Do you read me?

239
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:22,532
Is anyone out there?

240
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,157
Let's try another channel.

241
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,791
I repeat...

242
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:38,499
This is Dr. Joan Tallis of SETI,

243
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,630
the Un/ted States,
plane! Ea/1/1.

244
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:42,302
We- you.

245
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,515
We read you.

246
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,762
Clear...

247
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,302
Copy.

248
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,730
Verified?

249
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:02,197
This is Dr. Joan Tallis of SETI,

250
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:04,149
Is someone there?

251
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,573
Do you read me?

252
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,155
This is Dr. Joan T-Tallis.

253
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,741
We're getting feedback.

254
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:18,922
Hello?

255
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,334
Hello?

256
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:28,090
My name is Joan Tallis.

257
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:31,139
Whoa! No way!
I am the director of SETI.

258
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:34,813
Dude!
In Mountain View California.

259
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:40,944
When were you born?

260
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:50,283
May 7,1954.

261
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,456
When were you born?

262
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:58,704
May 7,1954.

263
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,256
Mount Pleasant, New York.

264
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:03,754
Robinson Hope Hospital.

265
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:10,765
I took a trip to Cape Canaveral
when I was a kid.

266
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,886
Did you?

267
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:18,144
Yes. I was 11.

268
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,737
What did you buy
at the gift store?

269
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,245
Space food

270
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,041
I thought I would be
going to space.

271
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:41,589
I bought these...
astro strawberries..

272
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,760
- What?
- Oh, come on.

273
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:51,340
- No way, dude! No way!
- What does that- What does that mean?

274
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:54,183
It's- it's- Listen. What does that mean?
I don't understand what that means.

275
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,852
Kimberly, it's just
an elaborate hoax.

276
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,721
- There's gotta be an explanation.
- We're all gonna die.

277
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,306
- Wait, wait!
- We are all gonna die.

278
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:47,317
It would be very hard to think
"I am over there"...

279
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,773
And "Can I go meet me?"...

280
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:54,077
And "Is that me better
than this me?"

281
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,873
"Can I learn from the other me?”

282
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:01,292
"Has the other me made
the same mistakes I've made?”.

283
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:05,498
Or "Can I sit down and have
a conversation with me?”."

284
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,708
Wouldn't that be
an interesting thing?

285
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:11,421
The truth is, we do that
all day long every day.

286
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:16,509
People don't admit it and they don't
think about it too much, but they do.

287
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,844
Everyday, they're talking
in their own head.

288
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,850
”What's he doing?"
”Why'd he do that?"

289
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:23,728
"What did she think?”
"Did I say the right thing?"

290
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:26,902
In this case,
there is another you out there.

291
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,306
Wanna take a look?

292
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:13,820
My God.

293
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,890
Yeah.

294
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,136
Wow.

295
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,236
You're up there
and I'm up there.

296
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,911
It's just too much.

297
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,206
I wonder if I'm cleaning your house.

298
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,453
Ha!

299
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,368
Maybe.

300
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:15,131
- Total's 29.
- Thank you.

301
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:23,760
Can you hand me a paper towel?

302
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:27,768
Thanks.

303
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,317
If you wanna join me...

304
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,737
Round one.

305
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,409
You can come in.

306
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,592
Knockout.

307
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,594
You wanna play?

308
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,971
I don't know how.

309
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,518
It's easy.

310
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,516
It's easy.
You're a fighter, I'm sure.

311
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,597
The controller's up on the...

312
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,726
Hold the big one
in your right hand.

313
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,527
You okay playing boxing?
Yeah, yeah.

314
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,573
Okay.

315
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:22,198
To block shots,
you put your hands up.

316
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:24,029
Face.

317
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:26,865
And you- You know,
you lean and stuff.

318
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:30,043
And then for swinging, you just swing.
That's it.

319
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:31,495
All right?

320
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:34,047
Round one. Fight.

321
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,008
You gotta fight back.

322
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:48,186
Don't forget your uppercut.

323
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,647
One! Two!
My guy's, uh, on the ground.

324
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,599
That's it.

325
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:55,526
Knockout! God.

326
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,817
How do I hook my- You gotta swing.
You gotta swing. It's okay.

327
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,531
Easy.

328
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:05,620
Yeah. Try and break
through this.

329
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,792
Okay. That one...
I gave you.

330
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:24,097
Knockout!

331
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:26,891
Player one wins!
Okay.

332
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:31,096
Well...

333
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:33,181
That it, or you got
another one in you?

334
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,817
I thought so.

335
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,204
I didn't see your car.

336
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:59,382
I take Metro-North.

337
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:03,545
I'll give you a lift.

338
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:05,881
No, that's all right.

339
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:09,639
No, it's too cold to wait for the train.

340
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,435
I don't mind the cold.

341
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:14,272
Really, it's okay.

342
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:18,272
Okay.

343
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:20,103
It's typical for planets...

344
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,439
Like Mercury, Venus,
Mars and Jupiter...

345
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:24,115
to have a period
during their orbit...

346
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,192
In which they are
obscured by the sun...

347
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:28,653
and no long observable from Earth.

348
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,704
It's called superior conjunction.

349
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,327
If they remain behind the sun...

350
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:39,046
So, are you from New Haven?

351
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,299
Yeah.

352
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:44,044
Still have family there?
Mm-hmm.

353
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,258
You like working
at Maid in Haven?

354
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,810
It's all right.

355
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:55,729
Yeah. Have you
been doing it long?

356
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:57,978
Couple months.

357
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:00,568
You see that Joan Tallis broadcast?
Yeah.

358
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:03,564
It's crazy.
I can't stop thinking about it.

359
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,774
Another me up there somewhere.

360
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,988
If you met yourself,
what would you say?

361
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:17,085
"“Hey, you up
for a video game?"

362
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:22,256
Probably beat me.

363
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,710
What would you say?

364
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,139
“Better luck next time.”.

365
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,056
Really? No, no.

366
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:35,603
No, I mean...

367
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,181
I'm sure I'd be speechless.

368
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:47,278
Up at the corner here is good.
Right here, and then you can just...

369
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,029
No, I'll take you to your house.
Ls this it?

370
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,611
Yeah, okay. Right. Turn.

371
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,994
Yeah, just to the side
behind the van. Okay.

372
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,375
All right.
So I'll see you next week. Yeah.

373
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:09,004
Thanks for the lift.
Sure.

374
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:11,260
Oh, um, you know...

375
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:14,013
I'm sorry. My memory's not what it used to be.
I forgot your name.

376
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,017
I don't think I ever told you.

377
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,191
Really?

378
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:24,735
That's not very polite of me.
So, it's...

379
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,064
Rhoda.

380
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,534
Rhoda. All right.

381
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,664
Good night, Rhoda.
I'll see you next week.

382
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,625
Good night.

383
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:16,404
Listen to me.

384
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,081
Keep your mind clear.

385
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:21,251
And that's it.

386
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,124
You will have peace of mind.

387
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,956
My dear, don't worry.

388
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,963
Learn to adjust yourself.

389
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,808
The distance is not inordinately great.

390
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:40,763
But one of the challenges you have...

391
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:43,018
on interplanetary travel...

392
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:45,646
is prolonged weightless conditions.

393
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:47,602
You're in Zero ”G. ”.

394
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:51,906
There is a possibility of
cosmic rays coming from stars,

395
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:54,109
and that could be
dangerous to them.

396
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:55,569
But once there,

397
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:58,746
you have no idea
what you Te about to encounter.

398
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:03,042
What really are the beings
on this other planet like?

399
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:39,741
What happened?

400
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,831
I tried to do too much.

401
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:51,753
Thanks.

402
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:58,431
You know that story
of the Russian cosmonaut?

403
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,509
Mm-mmm.

404
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,476
Thanks.

405
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:11,235
So, the cosmonaut.
Mm-hmm.

406
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:14,860
He's the first man ever
to go into space.

407
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:17,158
Right? The Russians
beat the Americans.

408
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:18,450
Mm-hmm.

409
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:21,120
So he goes up
in this big spaceship,

410
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:24,324
but the only habitable
part of it's very small.

411
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:27,411
So the cosmonaut's in there,

412
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,621
and he's got this portal window,

413
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:34,460
and he's looking out of it, and he
sees the curvature of the Earth...

414
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:36,465
for the first time.

415
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:40,765
I mean, the first man to ever
look at the planet he's from.

416
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:45,512
And he's lost in that moment.

417
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:50,521
And all of a sudden
this strange ticking...

418
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,822
begins coming out
of the dashboard.

419
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,488
Okay. Yeah.

420
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:03,322
Rips out the control panel, right?
Takes out his tools.

421
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:06,874
Trying to find the sound,
trying to stop the sound.

422
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:09,998
But he can't find it.
He can't stop it. It keeps going.

423
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:16,672
Few hours into this,

424
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:18,549
begins to feel like torture.

425
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:22,427
A few days go by
with this sound,

426
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:28,354
and he knows that
this small sound...

427
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:30,352
will break him.

428
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:32,775
He'll lose his mind.

429
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,730
What's he gonna do?
He's up in space,

430
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:39,190
alone, in a space closet.

431
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:42,743
He's got 25 days left to go...

432
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:45,037
with this sound.

433
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,661
So the cosmonaut decides...

434
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,959
the only way
to save his sanity...

435
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:54,546
is to fall in love with this sound.

436
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,509
So he closes his eyes...

437
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:05,801
and he goes into
his imagination,

438
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:11,514
and then he opens them.

439
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,894
He doesn't hear ticking any more.

440
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:18,980
He hears music.

441
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:24,694
And he spends
the remainder of his time...

442
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:30,621
sailing through space
in total bliss...

443
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,540
and peace.

444
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:49,515
Why... are you cleaning houses?

445
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:53,431
I like to clean.

446
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:56,901
Nobody likes to clean.

447
00:48:56,976 --> 00:49:01,402
Some people build houses,
some people decorate them,

448
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,733
some people clean them.

449
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:10,540
How old are you?
Did you go to college?

450
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:13,792
No.

451
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,920
I read.

452
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:20,750
A wise choice.

453
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:25,721
I was a college professor.
You learn more doing it by yourself.

454
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:41,145
Did you hear about
that contest?

455
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:42,821
Mmm?

456
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:45,400
- The shuttle to Earth Two?
- Mmm.

457
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,368
I submitted an essay.

458
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:55,451
You did?

459
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,505
It's silly.

460
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:05,552
You'd go?

461
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:12,347
Yes.

462
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,394
You don't know what's out there.

463
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:19,354
That's why I would go.

464
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,945
It's a bad idea.

465
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:28,617
In Plato's allegory of the cave,
the people living in the cave...

466
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,200
All they knew,
what was in the cave,

467
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,411
and one day
one of them gets out...

468
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:40,872
and goes out and...

469
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:44,084
sees the real world,
comes back and tells the others.

470
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,544
You know what happened to him?
They beat him up.

471
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:52,182
They didn't believe it.
“That can't be, ” they said.

472
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,684
I don't think we're ready
to know what's out there.

473
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,231
It's a bad idea.

474
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,183
So you'd rather
stay in the cave?

475
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:03,065
I mean,
if Galileo had felt that,

476
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:06,363
we'd still think we're the center of the
universe, that the sun is orbiting us.

477
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:08,691
I mean- They tried to burn him
at the stake for that.

478
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,947
Yeah, maybe they should have.

479
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:13,245
We still think we're
the center of the universe.

480
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,947
We call ourselves Earth One,
and them Earth Two.

481
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,374
You think they called
themselves Earth Two?

482
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,789
Probably not.
Did you wash that?

483
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:23,585
Did you wash that sweater? Yeah.
Yes. I didn't dry it. I...

484
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:25,666
I laid it-
Give me that.

485
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:29,336
Why did you wash that?

486
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:34,634
Stop washing things.
Just stop washing things!

487
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:38,221
Leave them alone! Please!
Just go!

488
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:50,400
This isn't a planet with little
green men and blue avatars.

489
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,405
It's essentially a mirror Earth.

490
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:55,863
If we strike them,
they could strike us.

491
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:59,291
If we attempt to enslave them,
they could enslave us.

492
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:02,711
It's the perfect scenario
for mutually assured destruction.

493
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:20,638
Preparations are nearing completion...

494
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:23,315
for interplanetary travel
to Earth Two.

495
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,690
The modifed Saturn 5 rocket
has undergone rigorous testing...

496
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:28,942
fo meet federal
aerospace guidelines.

497
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:32,366
Protesters are calling this
a modern-day Tower of Babel.

498
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:34,660
Where's Purdeep?

499
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:36,487
Checked out.

500
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,789
When's he coming back?

501
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,537
I don't think he is.

502
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:42,584
Poured bleach in his ears.

503
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:44,586
What?

504
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:47,624
Yeah.

505
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:50,751
Why would he do that?

506
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:54,134
Look. I don't know.
I mean, why'd he pour bleach in his eyes?

507
00:52:57,758 --> 00:53:00,807
He blinded himself?
Yeah.

508
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,809
You didn't know?

509
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:06,775
He said he was tired
of seeing himself everywhere.

510
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,110
Hi.
Hi.

511
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:54,190
Um, would you mind coming around
to the passenger side?

512
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,942
Just 'cause there's
traffic and- Oh.

513
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:09,671
I tried to reach you at your work, but
they said they had never heard of you.

514
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:13,338
Um, management
changes there all the time.

515
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:15,966
Is that why none of my checks
have been cashed?

516
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:21,593
That's weird. I-
It must've slipped through their books.

517
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,769
I mean,
I've been getting paid, so...

518
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:25,517
Okay. Well...

519
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:28,270
Anyway, that's...

520
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:31,101
That's not why I'm here.
I wanted to apologize for the other day.

521
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:33,979
You know, I just- I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have been...

522
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,027
touching things in your room.
No, it's not...

523
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:38,529
It's not your fault.
I should not have gotten upset.

524
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,153
I'm sorry.

525
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:45,829
Can I take you somewhere...

526
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:47,876
and show-
show you something?

527
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,329
Right now?

528
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:52,085
Yeah.

529
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:55,005
I have to help my mom
out, but- Please,

530
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:57,051
come with me?

531
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:26,198
The best seat in the house
is this row, right here.

532
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,249
Uh, it's the one in the middle.

533
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,223
Okay.

534
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:12,670
Just a little out of tune.

535
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:25,345
That's better, huh?

536
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:28,925
I'd finally got to
a content place in my life.

537
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,889
Our son was five, and my wife
was pregnant with a girl.

538
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:40,183
And then...

539
01:00:43,098 --> 01:00:44,896
they were killed.

540
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,563
Drunk driver.
A teenager.

541
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:53,441
I was in a coma.

542
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:58,079
And I was sleeping
all the time.

543
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:03,376
And I was so... angry.

544
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:06,625
So afraid of what I might
do to that kid. You know?

545
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:11,843
So I made sure my brother got
all the court documents.

546
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:16,757
The driver was a minor,
so I never found out the name.

547
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,848
Are you still there?

548
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,846
He can't hear or see anything.

549
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:48,560
Okay.

550
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,563
Thank you.
You're welcome.

551
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:06,207
Rhoda.

552
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,599
You are wondering why.

553
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:36,904
No.

554
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:39,524
No.

555
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:41,359
No.

556
01:03:41,443 --> 01:03:43,741
You know why.

557
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:07,579
Oh, Rhoda.

558
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:10,157
Yeah, I got some information
you might want to hear.

559
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:13,869
Shoot a three for it.

560
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:19,174
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay. Wait. Wait.

561
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:21,627
Um, I'll give you a hint.

562
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,921
Do you wanna get high?

563
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:27,929
With you?

564
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:29,600
No, no.

565
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:33,146
Do you want to get high?

566
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:43,281
They called.

567
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:45,029
Number's on your door.

568
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:47,527
Seriously?

569
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:49,863
Seriously.

570
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:00,794
Wait. Hey.

571
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:03,002
You better write back to me
this time, okay?

572
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:44,672
United Space Ventures,
Keith Harding's office.

573
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:49,381
Hello. This is, uh,
Rhoda Williams.

574
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:52,183
My brother gave me this number.

575
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:54,761
Rhoda, yes.
Just a moment.

576
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,523
Rhoda? Yes.

577
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:05,276
Hi. It's Keith Harding.
I got your letter.

578
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:08,283
I was very moved by it.

579
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:11,411
You know, when I was 15,

580
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:14,365
my headmaster said to me-
he said, uh,

581
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:18,418
"Harding, yo'll either go to prison
or be a millionaire."

582
01:07:18,493 --> 01:07:20,791
Yeah, well' I'm...

583
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:23,123
I'm grateful it was the latter.

584
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:26,426
But, uh, it's a fine line.

585
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:28,299
And finer than you would think.

586
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:31,760
You still want to
go to space, Rhoda?

587
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:33,261
Do I...

588
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:35,681
Yes.

589
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,762
Well you can.

590
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:39,722
The seat is yours.

591
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,858
Kerry'll be in touch with you
with the details.

592
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:46,153
I'll see you soon.

593
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:12,555
- Within our lifetimes,
- We have marveled.

594
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:17,431
As biologists have managed to look
at ever smaller and smaller things.

595
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:20,434
And astronomers have looked
further and further...

596
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:24,313
into the dark night sky,
back in time and out in space.

597
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:27,904
But maybe
the most mysterious of all...

598
01:08:27,979 --> 01:08:30,402
Is neither the small
nor the large.

599
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:32,529
It's us, up close.

600
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:36,496
Could we even
recognize ourselves?

601
01:08:36,571 --> 01:08:39,324
And if we did,
would we know ourselves?

602
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:42,251
What would we say to ourselves?

603
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:44,955
What would we learn
from ourselves?

604
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:47,132
What would we really
like to see...

605
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:50,130
if we could
stand outside ourselves...

606
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:52,177
and look at us?

607
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:52,708
Hi.

608
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,383
A nice surprise.

609
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:57,379
You're all dressed up.

610
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:01,925
Do you remember that essay
contest I told you about?

611
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:04,386
Travel to Earth Two?

612
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:05,971
Uh-huh.

613
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:08,557
I won.

614
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:12,268
I'm gonna go to space.

615
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:14,149
You won. That's great.

616
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:19,363
That's fantastic.
We have to celebrate. Come here.

617
01:11:19,484 --> 01:11:21,077
Come on. We have to.

618
01:11:21,152 --> 01:11:23,450
Come here.
We have to celebrate.

619
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:25,452
First things first...

620
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:28,000
is to start with a drink.

621
01:11:28,075 --> 01:11:30,954
We have to celebrate.

622
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:32,960
I can't believe...

623
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:35,588
How many people-
How many people wrote in?

624
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:37,168
That is...

625
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:43,303
I'm so happy for you.

626
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:48,346
To the coming true
of your most improbable dream.

627
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:50,181
Congratulations.

628
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:00,733
Next step is a feast.

629
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:04,408
I'm gonna cook you a
celebration feast. Yeah.

630
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:06,202
Okay?
Okay.

631
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:09,659
Okay, uh, food.
We need food first.

632
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:17,838
And...

633
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:20,670
do they know
how prepared you are?

634
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:24,053
I mean, with the Joan Tallis
costume, for Halloween?

635
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:26,600
I will be fully
trained in the Mojave Desert.

636
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:28,804
Oh. Well, that's comforting.

637
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:31,560
They made me sign this waiver.

638
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:35,860
Basically every other line of it
says, “lf you die, it's your fault.”.

639
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:39,280
And you seem- you
seem totally okay with that.

640
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:45,112
You know, you'll need
an executor for your will.

641
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:47,117
Do you have one?

642
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,574
No, but I don't have anything.

643
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:53,040
Okay, so nothing to no one.

644
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:56,214
Sounds pretty easy.
I think I could handle that.

645
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:58,417
Um, burial or cremation?

646
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:03,300
I think my body would
probably burn up on reentry.

647
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:05,928
Or be lost in space, so...

648
01:13:06,007 --> 01:13:09,853
Okay. Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.

649
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:17,144
We'll have to hold
a memorial service.

650
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:20,313
Who would you like to attend?

651
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:25,651
I don't know.

652
01:13:27,695 --> 01:13:29,242
You?

653
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:38,164
Don't go.

654
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,968
Please don't go.

655
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:48,678
We're so close
to something here.

656
01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:57,942
We can't.

657
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:00,440
Why can't we?

658
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:05,529
You know that we can't.
I know that we have.

659
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:10,075
Stay, please?

660
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:41,435
Let me tell you a story.

661
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:48,568
And if, after,
you still want me to stay,

662
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:53,122
I will Stay.

663
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:04,883
It's about a girl.

664
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:10,590
At the start, she's...

665
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:14,310
naive,

666
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:18,097
reckless.

667
01:15:21,726 --> 01:15:23,979
She does something that is...

668
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:28,608
unforgivable.

669
01:15:32,153 --> 01:15:36,954
And one day,
she goes to apologize.

670
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:40,954
But she loses her nerve.

671
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:45,799
She's weak.

672
01:15:47,168 --> 01:15:49,341
She lies to him.

673
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:57,053
And then...

674
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:03,310
she thinks that she might,
in the smallest ways,

675
01:16:04,477 --> 01:16:08,357
be able to make his life
just a little bit better.

676
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:14,662
And so she wakes up
every day just to do that.

677
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:20,327
And some days
she thinks it's for him.

678
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:24,255
Other days, she worries
that it's for herself,

679
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:27,254
that it was really just a way
to survive what I have done.

680
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:32,133
But I think that
I do make you happy.

681
01:16:32,213 --> 01:16:33,886
Oh, my God.

682
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:36,843
I know that you make me happy.

683
01:16:51,982 --> 01:16:54,360
It was my fault.

684
01:16:59,657 --> 01:17:02,080
I killed your wife and your son.

685
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,872
You better leave.

686
01:17:11,085 --> 01:17:12,803
Get out.

687
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,058
Get out now!

688
01:17:23,264 --> 01:17:25,016
Now!

689
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:55,763
- The mistery fight member.
- Is 21-year-old RhodaWilliams,

690
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:58,091
who is rumored to be
an ex-convict.

691
01:17:58,174 --> 01:17:59,972
Her records are of limit
to the public,

692
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:03,020
as the alleged crime
occurred when she was under age.

693
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:06,520
There are reports of offers up to
three million dollars on the Web...

694
01:18:06,599 --> 01:18:08,977
for a ticket
aboard USV's flight.

695
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:11,775
We're getting word now that she's
arriving at her residence in New HaVen,

696
01:18:11,896 --> 01:18:14,069
where Robert Hughes is standing by.
Oh. Oh. Can you get...

697
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:16,196
Right here.

698
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:19,612
Rhoda, are you going to space?

699
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:24,037
Rhoda Williams.
Rhoda.

700
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:27,624
Just one photo.

701
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:30,881
Rhoda.

702
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:32,674
You couldn't have told us?

703
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:35,135
We had to find out from the media?
I ju...

704
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:36,963
I just found out.

705
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:39,799
I wasn't sure I wanted to go.
I didn't...

706
01:18:39,882 --> 01:18:42,135
Are you going?

707
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:45,975
I'm gonna go.

708
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:47,648
Well, now-
now, wait a minute.

709
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:50,476
I mean, don't you think we- we should
have a discussion about this?

710
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:52,812
Oh, they're in the backyard now.

711
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,649
Look, Rob-
Rhoda. Rhoda.

712
01:19:24,468 --> 01:19:26,766
Joining me
now from Washington, D.C.

713
01:19:26,845 --> 01:19:29,769
Astrophysicist
Dr. Richard Berendzen,

714
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:33,443
the original proponent of this
extraordinary Broken Mirror Theory.

715
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:36,648
Dr. Berendzen,
tell me the significance of this theory,

716
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:38,653
why it excites you
and how this changes...

717
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:42,327
the possibilities of the planet
known as Earth Two.

718
01:19:42,403 --> 01:19:44,906
In the grand
history of the cosmos,

719
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:48,334
more than 13,000 million years old,

720
01:19:48,409 --> 01:19:51,208
our Earth is replicated elsewhere.

721
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:53,540
But maybe there's another way
of seeing this world.

722
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:58,882
If any small variation arises...

723
01:19:58,961 --> 01:20:01,339
they look this way
you look that way...

724
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:05,013
suddeny maybe everything changes,

725
01:20:05,092 --> 01:20:07,766
and now you begin to wonder,

726
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:11,060
what else is different?

727
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:13,643
Or one might say that ..

728
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:16,980
You have an exact mirror image
which suddenly is shattered,

729
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:19,064
and there's a new reality.

730
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:23,073
And there in lies the opportunity ..

731
01:20:23,736 --> 01:20:25,579
And the mystery.

732
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:27,873
What else?

733
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:30,371
What new? What now?

734
01:21:17,164 --> 01:21:19,292
Stay away!

735
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:26,761
Get away from me.

736
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:30,557
Please let me in. Please.
Just- Stay- Stay away from me!

737
01:21:30,636 --> 01:21:32,684
Stay away!

738
01:22:07,297 --> 01:22:08,799
John?

739
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:45,965
- John?
- Stay away from me.

740
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:47,967
John, please let me in.

741
01:22:48,088 --> 01:22:50,090
Stay away from me!
Open the door.

742
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:52,138
I'm warning you, stay away from me!
Please.

743
01:22:52,217 --> 01:22:55,016
I have something I have to explain.
I have to tell you. Please.

744
01:22:55,095 --> 01:22:56,813
Wait.

745
01:22:56,889 --> 01:22:58,732
Okay...

746
01:23:04,062 --> 01:23:05,564
John.

747
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:09,155
Do it.

748
01:24:02,287 --> 01:24:04,836
I heard on TV about a theory.

749
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:11,471
They think...

750
01:24:12,673 --> 01:24:16,644
that the moment
we first saw the other Earth...

751
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:21,808
was the moment
our synchronicity was broken.

752
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:28,776
That was just
over four years ago.

753
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:35,533
Maybe they're up there.

754
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:38,706
Maybe not, but...

755
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:42,957
maybe.

756
01:25:47,893 --> 01:25:49,941
We are just
days before the launch...

757
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:52,068
of the United Space Ventures'
civilian shuttle.

758
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:54,275
Members of the crew
of this dangerous Voyage...

759
01:25:54,358 --> 01:25:57,703
have been training intensely
here at the Mojave Spaceport.

760
01:25:57,778 --> 01:25:59,530
The media blackout
was finally lifted ..

761
01:25:59,613 --> 01:26:01,536
With a press conference
early this morning.

762
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:04,084
I'm feeling privileged,

763
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:06,332
and

764
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:08,379
oddly, I'm proud.

765
01:26:10,290 --> 01:26:13,339
And of course,
nervous and excited.

766
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:16,297
The modified Saturn 5 rocket...

767
01:26:16,421 --> 01:26:18,594
See you, Freddie.
Has undergone rigorous testing...
