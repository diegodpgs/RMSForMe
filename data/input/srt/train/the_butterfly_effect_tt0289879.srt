1
00:01:17,337 --> 00:01:20,886
'If anyone finds this,

2
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:24,568
it means my plan...

3
00:01:24,802 --> 00:01:26,872
didn't work...

4
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:29,693
and I'm already dead.

5
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:32,323
- Evan?
- I think he's in here.

6
00:01:32,517 --> 00:01:34,189
But if I can somehow

7
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:36,990
go back to the beginning

8
00:01:37,187 --> 00:01:39,940
- all of this, I might be able
- Evan!

9
00:01:41,858 --> 00:01:44,133
To save her.'

10
00:01:44,318 --> 00:01:46,354
Evan!

11
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,936
Evan!

12
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,036
We're gonna be
late again.

13
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:43,271
When did you ever care
about getting to school on time?

14
00:02:43,494 --> 00:02:45,849
We're putting up pictures
for parents' night.

15
00:02:46,037 --> 00:02:48,597
Don't worry,
you'll have plenty of time.

16
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:52,509
Is Dad gonna come?

17
00:02:52,668 --> 00:02:54,420
You know the answer to that.

18
00:02:54,586 --> 00:02:56,861
Can't he just
come out for one day?

19
00:02:57,047 --> 00:02:58,924
We've been over this 100 times.

20
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,682
It's too dangerous for him.

21
00:03:00,842 --> 00:03:02,912
But Lenny said
his dad's coming,

22
00:03:03,094 --> 00:03:04,925
and Tommy
and Kayleigh's dad...

23
00:03:05,095 --> 00:03:07,563
Okay, I get the point.

24
00:03:07,764 --> 00:03:09,595
But I'm not so bad, am I?

25
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:11,358
No.

26
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,254
Okay, have a great day.

27
00:03:27,448 --> 00:03:29,643
I love you.
I'll pick you up later. Gotta go.

28
00:03:31,785 --> 00:03:33,423
Bye.

29
00:03:36,163 --> 00:03:38,040
Bye!

30
00:03:40,626 --> 00:03:42,423
Mrs Treborn, I need
to speak with you.

31
00:03:42,586 --> 00:03:44,781
Can it wait till tonight?
I'm late for work and...

32
00:03:44,963 --> 00:03:47,477
I think you really
need to see this.

33
00:03:49,425 --> 00:03:51,461
Tommy, leave Lenny alone.

34
00:03:51,635 --> 00:03:53,705
Don't make me send you
to Mr Voytek's office.

35
00:03:55,472 --> 00:03:57,224
I was gonna show this
to the principal,

36
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,108
but I thought I should
talk to you first.

37
00:03:59,266 --> 00:04:00,381
What is it?

38
00:04:00,518 --> 00:04:02,429
Yesterday I had all the children
make drawings

39
00:04:02,603 --> 00:04:04,355
of what they wanted to be
when they grew up.

40
00:04:04,521 --> 00:04:06,796
Most of them made drawings
of what their parents did.

41
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:08,573
But this...

42
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:20,394
I don't understand.

43
00:04:20,576 --> 00:04:22,532
Evan did this?

44
00:04:24,746 --> 00:04:27,658
- Can I keep this drawing?
- Oh, of course.

45
00:04:27,874 --> 00:04:29,671
Um, there is one more thing,
Mrs Treborn,

46
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:32,792
- I feel bad even mentioning.
- What?

47
00:04:33,004 --> 00:04:34,801
When I asked Evan
about the drawing,

48
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:38,479
well, he couldn't
remember doing it.

49
00:04:46,849 --> 00:04:49,044
I don't wanna go.

50
00:04:50,435 --> 00:04:52,710
I don't like this place, Mum.

51
00:04:52,895 --> 00:04:54,726
I think it's creepy.

52
00:04:56,023 --> 00:04:58,298
I promise I won't
make any bad pictures.

53
00:04:58,484 --> 00:05:00,679
You're gonna be fine, okay?

54
00:05:00,861 --> 00:05:03,250
He just wants to do
a couple tests, that's all.

55
00:05:03,446 --> 00:05:05,562
- Oh.
- You'll like him.

56
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:11,510
That's good.
You're doing great.

57
00:05:11,703 --> 00:05:14,695
Just tell me he hasn't inherited
his father's illness.

58
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:17,189
I'm sure the test results
will come back negative.

59
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,889
But there's something else you can do
to monitor his memory.

60
00:05:20,085 --> 00:05:22,724
- Anything.
- A journal.

61
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:25,196
Just have him write down
everything that he does.

62
00:05:25,381 --> 00:05:28,020
- And what will that do?
- It could help jog his memory.

63
00:05:28,217 --> 00:05:30,890
See if he remembers
anything new the next day.

64
00:05:31,095 --> 00:05:33,404
These test results
will come back in a few days

65
00:05:33,597 --> 00:05:35,588
- and we'll take it from there.
- Okay.

66
00:05:35,765 --> 00:05:40,122
'Today Mummy is taking me
to play with Kayleigh and Tommy.

67
00:05:40,394 --> 00:05:43,306
I will meet their father
and see what a real dad is like.'

68
00:05:46,358 --> 00:05:48,428
Great, see you soon.

69
00:05:59,744 --> 00:06:01,939
Evan...

70
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:05,033
Evan, what are you doing
with that knife?

71
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,470
What happened?

72
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:17,783
Honey...

73
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:20,084
what were you doing
with that knife?

74
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,033
I don't remember.

75
00:06:35,441 --> 00:06:37,955
- Hey, Andrea.
- George.

76
00:06:38,152 --> 00:06:40,108
Hello, little man.

77
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:42,315
Watch your step.

78
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:48,214
Thanks, George.

79
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:51,088
- Not a problem.
- Here's my work number

80
00:06:51,288 --> 00:06:52,926
in case there are
any problems.

81
00:06:53,081 --> 00:06:55,436
And please keep
an eye on him 'cause...

82
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,024
What, are you kidding?

83
00:06:57,168 --> 00:06:59,363
We're going to have
a great time today, right, sport?

84
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:01,979
Okay, be good, kiddo.

85
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,446
I love you.

86
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,943
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, George.

87
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,295
Go long. Go on.
Right in the backyard.

88
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,788
Here it comes.

89
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,862
Evan, Evan, guess what?
Dad got a new video camera

90
00:07:15,058 --> 00:07:16,855
and we're all going
to be in a movie.

91
00:07:17,018 --> 00:07:18,974
That's right, Evan.

92
00:07:19,145 --> 00:07:22,342
And you get to be the star.

93
00:07:22,565 --> 00:07:24,078
I thought I was the star.

94
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:25,427
Hey, what did I tell you?

95
00:07:26,943 --> 00:07:28,581
Now, Evan...

96
00:07:28,736 --> 00:07:30,931
You have to promise

97
00:07:31,113 --> 00:07:34,583
your bestest,
super-duper promise

98
00:07:34,825 --> 00:07:37,020
that this will be
our little secret.

99
00:07:37,202 --> 00:07:40,274
- You think you can do that?
- Um-hmm.

100
00:07:40,496 --> 00:07:41,849
I'm r...

101
00:07:49,212 --> 00:07:50,850
Where am I?

102
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:52,643
Where did we all go?

103
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:54,676
Calm down, kid, stand still.

104
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:56,480
I was just somewhere else.

105
00:07:56,635 --> 00:07:58,068
How did I get here?

106
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,178
Quit acting like some damn retard,
or I'll call your mother

107
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:04,267
and tell her what a naughty
little shit you've been.

108
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,872
Kayleigh...

109
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,056
Kayleigh...

110
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,505
what happened?

111
00:08:22,532 --> 00:08:25,251
The good news is
the results are negative.

112
00:08:25,451 --> 00:08:27,282
I found no evidence of lesions,

113
00:08:27,453 --> 00:08:28,727
haemorrhaging, tumours.

114
00:08:28,871 --> 00:08:31,101
But you must have
something you can go on.

115
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,088
If I was to guess, I'd say
the blackouts are stress related.

116
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:36,248
But he's seven years old.

117
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,933
What kind of stress
can a seven-year-old have?

118
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,883
Plenty. Maybe he has
severe coping problems

119
00:08:42,091 --> 00:08:43,649
about not having a father.

120
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,950
You said the last time
the blackouts occurred

121
00:08:46,136 --> 00:08:47,888
he was visiting
his friend's dad.

122
00:08:49,805 --> 00:08:53,195
Well, he has been pushing me
to meet his father

123
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:56,744
- and I've been putting it off.
- It's worth a shot, Andrea.

124
00:08:56,978 --> 00:08:59,128
We can arrange
a controlled meeting.

125
00:08:59,314 --> 00:09:02,590
A careful dose of sedatives
for Jason, some security,

126
00:09:02,816 --> 00:09:04,727
Evan comes in
for a quick visit,

127
00:09:04,902 --> 00:09:06,460
and with a little luck,

128
00:09:06,611 --> 00:09:08,920
no more
missing father complex.

129
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,861
'April 15th.

130
00:09:15,035 --> 00:09:17,071
Today I get to meet my father.

131
00:09:17,245 --> 00:09:20,043
His name is Jason
and he's crazy.

132
00:09:20,248 --> 00:09:22,398
I hope he lets me
call him Dad.'

133
00:09:25,502 --> 00:09:27,413
You mean Dad lives here?

134
00:09:27,588 --> 00:09:29,465
Not in this wing, actually, no.

135
00:09:29,631 --> 00:09:31,428
Now if your dad seems
a little sleepy,

136
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:33,661
it's because
of the medicine, okay?

137
00:09:33,843 --> 00:09:35,071
Okay.

138
00:09:38,013 --> 00:09:39,844
It'll just be a moment, okay?

139
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,313
It's okay. I won't bite.

140
00:10:14,961 --> 00:10:17,156
You've seen pictures
of me, right?

141
00:10:17,338 --> 00:10:20,375
Uh-huh. Mum says
I have your smile

142
00:10:20,591 --> 00:10:22,900
and your hair.

143
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,789
Nooo!

144
00:10:28,848 --> 00:10:30,998
He has to die!
It's the only way!

145
00:10:31,183 --> 00:10:33,572
Jason, stop!

146
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:35,168
No!

147
00:10:37,522 --> 00:10:39,956
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be alright.

148
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:42,902
He's hurt bad.
Get a stretcher.

149
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,436
- Come on, let's get him out of here.
- I'm so sorry.

150
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,843
In sure and certain hope

151
00:10:49,032 --> 00:10:51,341
of the resurrection
to eternal life,

152
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:54,526
we commend to almighty God,
our brother Jason.

153
00:10:54,745 --> 00:10:57,020
The Lord bless him
and keep him,

154
00:10:57,206 --> 00:10:59,845
the Lord make his face
to shine upon him,

155
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,157
and be gracious unto him

156
00:11:02,335 --> 00:11:05,168
and give him peace. Amen.

157
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:47,332
Come on, where is it?
Damn, I know it's down here somewhere.

158
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,937
Tommy, I'm bored shitless
over here. What's up already?

159
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,957
Yeah, what are you
looking for, anyway?

160
00:11:52,127 --> 00:11:55,244
Shut up, lard arse. And you,
hold your fucking horses.

161
00:11:55,463 --> 00:11:57,454
You know,
it's here somewhere.

162
00:11:57,632 --> 00:11:59,748
We should go soon.

163
00:11:59,926 --> 00:12:02,486
If dad catches us smoking
down here, we're dead.

164
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:04,953
So let's go.

165
00:12:07,015 --> 00:12:09,813
I knew Dad had
a blockbuster down here!

166
00:12:10,017 --> 00:12:11,894
Let's blow the shit
out of something.

167
00:12:21,694 --> 00:12:23,685
Here you go, buddy.

168
00:12:23,863 --> 00:12:25,342
What? No freaking way.

169
00:12:25,489 --> 00:12:28,287
- I'm not touching this thing.
- The hell you aren't.

170
00:12:28,492 --> 00:12:31,131
Any of us does it and you're gonna
puss out and nark for sure.

171
00:12:31,327 --> 00:12:33,966
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy.
Look how small this fuse is.

172
00:12:34,163 --> 00:12:36,472
- I'll get killed.
- Not necessarily.

173
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,916
There you go.

174
00:12:42,086 --> 00:12:44,441
It should buy you
two minutes at least.

175
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,143
Gee thanks, friend.

176
00:12:55,598 --> 00:12:58,032
Aw, for Christ's sake,
Lenny, you moron, just do it.

177
00:13:09,943 --> 00:13:12,935
- Thanks.
- You got balls, man.

178
00:13:13,155 --> 00:13:14,986
Shit took you long enough.

179
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,818
What the hell? Come on!

180
00:13:44,973 --> 00:13:46,850
Evan, come on.
Help me get him up!

181
00:13:47,017 --> 00:13:49,167
Evan, get your arse back here
and help me get him up.

182
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:50,944
What the hell happened?
Where are we?

183
00:13:51,104 --> 00:13:53,015
Oh my God.
What did we do?

184
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:55,657
Evan, come on. Help me.

185
00:13:55,858 --> 00:13:57,928
Oh my God, how could we?

186
00:13:58,109 --> 00:14:00,577
- Come on, let's go!
- Shit, Lenny, what happened to you?

187
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:02,370
He's fine.
He's gonna be okay.

188
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,282
Everything's gonna be fine.

189
00:14:04,448 --> 00:14:06,564
What's wrong with him?
Why isn't he speaking?

190
00:14:06,742 --> 00:14:08,460
He's in shock, ma'am.

191
00:14:12,705 --> 00:14:14,616
What is it?
What happened?

192
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,781
We were just in the woods
building a fort

193
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,075
when Lenny freaked out.
One minute he was okay,

194
00:14:19,252 --> 00:14:21,368
and then he just froze up.
Right, guys?

195
00:14:21,546 --> 00:14:23,741
What happened, Evan?
The truth.

196
00:14:23,923 --> 00:14:25,879
I don't know.
I don't remember.

197
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:29,008
Something must have happened.
Something set him off.

198
00:14:29,219 --> 00:14:31,414
I blacked it out.

199
00:14:31,596 --> 00:14:34,429
Don't try to use your blackouts
to get out of this one.

200
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:42,272
You're not making it up?

201
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:53,066
Breathe in and breathe out.

202
00:14:53,281 --> 00:14:54,873
And relax.

203
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:58,070
You are completely asleep.

204
00:14:58,286 --> 00:14:59,844
Relaxed.

205
00:15:01,121 --> 00:15:02,839
I want you to take me
to the time

206
00:15:02,998 --> 00:15:05,273
you were in the woods
with Lenny.

207
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,653
Think of it like a movie.

208
00:15:07,835 --> 00:15:10,190
You can pause, rewind,

209
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:13,689
or slow down
any details you wish.

210
00:15:13,924 --> 00:15:16,233
Understand?

211
00:15:17,427 --> 00:15:18,940
Yes.

212
00:15:19,095 --> 00:15:21,006
Where are you now?

213
00:15:22,598 --> 00:15:24,509
I'm standing next to Kayleigh.

214
00:15:24,683 --> 00:15:27,117
My hands are over her ears.

215
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,823
Are you hurting her?

216
00:15:28,978 --> 00:15:31,697
No, I'm protecting her.

217
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:33,809
Okay.

218
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:37,771
Now let's move forward in time.
What do you see?

219
00:15:41,406 --> 00:15:43,362
I see a car.

220
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:48,071
Yes, Evan,
tell me about the car.

221
00:15:49,287 --> 00:15:51,164
Go on.

222
00:15:51,331 --> 00:15:53,606
Nothing can hurt you.

223
00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:58,918
Remember, it's only a movie.
You are completely safe.

224
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:01,480
I can't...

225
00:16:01,673 --> 00:16:03,629
The car vanishes
and all of a sudden

226
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,597
I'm on the ground
in the woods.

227
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,079
The car doesn't vanish, Evan.

228
00:16:07,219 --> 00:16:10,131
The movie in your head
is broken, that's all.

229
00:16:10,347 --> 00:16:12,338
Now tell me about the car.

230
00:16:12,516 --> 00:16:14,029
I can't!

231
00:16:14,184 --> 00:16:16,539
It's coming...

232
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:18,683
Fight it, Evan, hurry.

233
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:20,685
It's coming!

234
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:22,687
- Oh my God!
- On the count of 10,

235
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:25,577
- you'll wake up feeling refreshed...
- What are you doing?

236
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:28,245
...and remembering everything
that we talked about.

237
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:29,845
What is happening?
Make it stop!

238
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,538
One, you're feeling awake. Two,
your eyes are not feeling as heavy.

239
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,058
- Five, six.
- Wake up!

240
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:38,035
- Come on, Evan, wake up! Nine, 10.
- Wake up!

241
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:42,155
Oh God.

242
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,962
What happened?

243
00:16:47,128 --> 00:16:48,481
Did it work?

244
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:57,883
Alright, thanks, Mum.
See you later.

245
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,522
Wipe that sad-arse look
off your face

246
00:17:08,688 --> 00:17:10,326
before you get us busted.

247
00:17:10,482 --> 00:17:12,632
Did you see the way Evan's mum
was looking at you?

248
00:17:12,817 --> 00:17:14,569
Sorry.

249
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,327
Alright, will someone
tell me already

250
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,287
what the hell happened
with the mailbox?

251
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,026
Don't you ever
bring that shit up again.

252
00:17:27,204 --> 00:17:29,274
Not ever!

253
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:36,910
Let's go.

254
00:17:40,007 --> 00:17:41,645
Are you okay?

255
00:17:55,728 --> 00:17:57,286
Holy shit!

256
00:17:57,438 --> 00:17:59,315
Look at that fat fuck!

257
00:17:59,482 --> 00:18:01,552
He's got bigger titties
than Lenny's mum.

258
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:04,531
- Shhh!
- Shut up, faggot.

259
00:18:04,736 --> 00:18:07,091
No one's talking to you.

260
00:18:30,758 --> 00:18:33,272
I'm sorry, Kayleigh,
this was a bad idea.

261
00:18:33,469 --> 00:18:36,666
You really don't remember
anything that happened?

262
00:18:38,598 --> 00:18:40,111
You're so lucky.

263
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:41,904
Look, everything's
gonna be okay.

264
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:45,096
Lenny'll be fine. You'll see.

265
00:18:46,522 --> 00:18:48,035
Sorry.

266
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,340
It's not your fault.
Mrs Kagan called Dad

267
00:18:50,525 --> 00:18:52,277
and blamed us
for what happened to Lenny.

268
00:18:52,443 --> 00:18:54,434
Your dad did that?

269
00:18:54,612 --> 00:18:58,366
- I deserve a lot worse.
- What are you talking about?

270
00:18:58,615 --> 00:19:00,651
What you deserve is
a better father and brother.

271
00:19:00,825 --> 00:19:03,055
All they do is
make you feel like shit.

272
00:19:05,913 --> 00:19:08,347
You really have no clue
how beautiful you are, do you?

273
00:19:19,675 --> 00:19:21,745
What the fuck are you doing?!

274
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:24,521
Buying popcorn.
What the fuck are you doing?

275
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:27,838
- Whoops.
- I can't believe you freaking did that.

276
00:19:28,057 --> 00:19:31,094
- He's a little punk.
- Why are you being such a dick?

277
00:19:36,314 --> 00:19:38,350
I can't believe
what you just did.

278
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,159
Stop it!

279
00:19:45,322 --> 00:19:46,641
Stop hitting him.

280
00:19:46,781 --> 00:19:48,658
What's wrong with you?

281
00:19:50,826 --> 00:19:53,101
Somebody, please help us.

282
00:19:53,287 --> 00:19:56,006
Alright, that's it, kid.
You're out of here.

283
00:19:59,334 --> 00:20:03,247
Get him away! Get him away!

284
00:20:03,504 --> 00:20:06,780
Now in another story,
the peaceful town of Briarville

285
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:08,599
was rocked this afternoon

286
00:20:08,758 --> 00:20:11,147
in the wake of a horrible
act of vandalism.

287
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:13,812
While police officials
in upstate New York believe

288
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,652
this was a simple act
of criminal mischief gone awry,

289
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:19,920
the tragedy has clearly
devastated the community.

290
00:20:20,143 --> 00:20:23,579
Now this was the grisly aftermath
of a powerful explosion

291
00:20:23,813 --> 00:20:27,249
believed to have been caused
by an unknown quantity of dynamite.

292
00:20:27,483 --> 00:20:31,237
The police have no leads,
no suspects and no motive...

293
00:20:49,209 --> 00:20:50,767
Good night.

294
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:02,592
We're moving.

295
00:21:20,403 --> 00:21:22,473
I can't believe
Tommy's still pissed at me.

296
00:21:22,654 --> 00:21:24,884
He knows
I'm moving away, right?

297
00:21:25,073 --> 00:21:27,382
He's been acting
real strange lately.

298
00:21:27,575 --> 00:21:30,043
He won't even look me
in the eyes anymore.

299
00:21:30,244 --> 00:21:32,075
Duck, here they come!

300
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:40,670
Did your mum say
if Lenny was okay?

301
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,906
He must be. I mean,
they're letting him out, right?

302
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:11,461
Welcome home.

303
00:22:11,613 --> 00:22:14,081
I thought you might like
some fresh air for a change.

304
00:22:14,282 --> 00:22:18,241
- Is Tommy with you guys?
- No. It's cool.

305
00:22:28,627 --> 00:22:30,504
So, what'd you do in there?

306
00:22:30,671 --> 00:22:32,866
It was awful.
You can't sleep because

307
00:22:33,048 --> 00:22:35,039
everybody's screaming
all night long.

308
00:22:36,926 --> 00:22:38,837
I never want to go back.

309
00:22:39,011 --> 00:22:40,364
Do you see that?

310
00:22:40,512 --> 00:22:42,468
Yeah, what's up
with the smoke?

311
00:23:05,826 --> 00:23:07,657
Crockett!

312
00:23:07,827 --> 00:23:09,419
What are you doing
with my dog?!

313
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,139
- Look what you made me do!
- What the hell's wrong with you?!

314
00:23:32,015 --> 00:23:35,325
Kayleigh. Oh, God, come on,
please wake up.

315
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:38,153
Wake up, please!
Wake up!

316
00:23:38,353 --> 00:23:40,992
Why don't you fucking kiss her,
Prince Charming?

317
00:23:52,032 --> 00:23:54,421
Ow.

318
00:23:57,161 --> 00:23:59,197
How long was I out?

319
00:24:01,915 --> 00:24:03,667
Kayleigh, what's wrong?

320
00:24:08,379 --> 00:24:10,813
Oh shit.

321
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:03,869
I'm sorry.

322
00:25:31,908 --> 00:25:33,580
Aced it.

323
00:25:33,743 --> 00:25:36,098
And time.
Put your pencils down

324
00:25:36,287 --> 00:25:39,563
and place your bluebooks
on my desk before you leave.

325
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:43,385
You too, Mr Nelson. We're all
in the same time-zone, here.

326
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:45,379
So how'd you do, Evan?

327
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:48,105
I don't know. I might have got
some of the stories mixed up.

328
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:51,528
Was it Pavlov that conditioned
his dog to lick his nuts?

329
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,600
Typical psych major,
a complete wise-arse.

330
00:25:56,804 --> 00:25:58,362
And how's your project coming?

331
00:25:58,514 --> 00:26:01,153
Are you still planning to change
the way we humble scientists

332
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,626
- view memory assimilation?
- Don't really have a choice.

333
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,968
Oh, jeez, it smells like
patchouli and arse in here.

334
00:26:37,172 --> 00:26:40,448
Cricket, this is my well-mannered
roommate, Evan.

335
00:26:40,675 --> 00:26:42,188
Yeah...

336
00:26:42,343 --> 00:26:44,379
you're the one
that fucked up the bell curve

337
00:26:44,553 --> 00:26:46,350
on my anthropology final.

338
00:26:46,513 --> 00:26:48,390
- Later, Thumper.
- Bye.

339
00:26:48,557 --> 00:26:50,673
Fucking dick.

340
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,364
- Wow, sweet girl, man.
- I found your shirt, bro'.

341
00:26:54,687 --> 00:26:56,518
Oh, you sick fuck.

342
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:01,500
Alright, man, get dressed.
You're taking me out.

343
00:27:01,735 --> 00:27:03,965
Why, what'd you do,
ace another midterm?

344
00:27:04,153 --> 00:27:05,825
No.

345
00:27:08,032 --> 00:27:10,910
Better than that,
seven years, no blackouts.

346
00:27:11,118 --> 00:27:14,235
Fuck yeah, bro',
let's do this!

347
00:27:14,454 --> 00:27:16,331
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah! Come and get it.

348
00:27:16,497 --> 00:27:19,648
Be gentle with me! Be gentle!
I'm postcoital. I'm tender.

349
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:22,025
Did she cradle the balls
and work the shaft?

350
00:27:26,923 --> 00:27:28,276
Nice.

351
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,568
Look at this fucking guy.

352
00:27:34,054 --> 00:27:35,885
Get the fuck out of my bar.

353
00:27:36,056 --> 00:27:38,206
So, which one of you
has the pet worm?

354
00:27:38,391 --> 00:27:40,859
Worms, plural!

355
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,858
Ah. That's so gross.

356
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:47,020
Talk to him about it.
He's got the fetish.

357
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:49,700
Watch it.
It's a psych project actually.

358
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,573
It's a study on memory loss.

359
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:54,808
Better explain before all this excitement
gives me a heart attack.

360
00:27:57,699 --> 00:27:59,496
10 bucks says he
eats it off the floor.

361
00:28:01,244 --> 00:28:03,075
Well, if I can figure out

362
00:28:03,245 --> 00:28:05,440
how the memories
in a simple worm function,

363
00:28:05,622 --> 00:28:07,931
it should help me to understand
the complexities...

364
00:28:10,043 --> 00:28:11,635
of the human brain.

365
00:28:13,588 --> 00:28:15,180
Let me get this shot.

366
00:28:22,554 --> 00:28:24,829
- What the fuck, weirdo?!
- Fuck this...

367
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:35,471
Well, I guess
that's your game.

368
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,999
Go, you go.

369
00:28:47,116 --> 00:28:48,947
It smells like sex in here.

370
00:28:49,118 --> 00:28:52,588
Yeah, Thumper had
a busy afternoon.

371
00:28:53,997 --> 00:28:56,830
You're kidding?
He's so big.

372
00:28:57,041 --> 00:28:58,838
Yeah.

373
00:28:59,001 --> 00:29:02,596
Well, I guess charisma
and eyeliner go a long way.

374
00:29:04,464 --> 00:29:06,659
- You want a beer?
- Yeah.

375
00:29:09,302 --> 00:29:12,499
You got any incense or scented candles
or something?

376
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:14,200
Okay.

377
00:29:15,807 --> 00:29:18,401
Whoa, no.

378
00:29:19,602 --> 00:29:21,354
Let me put this away.

379
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,715
Most guys usually tuck porn
under their bed.

380
00:29:23,897 --> 00:29:25,694
All you've got
are comp books?

381
00:29:25,857 --> 00:29:27,495
Yeah, they're my journals.

382
00:29:27,651 --> 00:29:29,801
I've been keeping them
since I was seven.

383
00:29:29,986 --> 00:29:31,055
Wow.

384
00:29:33,656 --> 00:29:36,534
Read me something.

385
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:39,017
I ought to be getting
something out of this.

386
00:29:39,202 --> 00:29:41,033
That's all I've got to say.

387
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:45,416
Here we go.

388
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:48,655
'It's like my mind refuses
to believe what I'm seeing.'

389
00:29:54,215 --> 00:29:57,890
'... Hearing Crockett
make those awful screams.

390
00:30:03,931 --> 00:30:07,207
Just writing about it
gives me the shivers.'

391
00:30:09,561 --> 00:30:12,314
Come on. Go on.

392
00:30:15,942 --> 00:30:20,094
'It was like Tommy
was possessed or something.

393
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,760
There was a hate
in his eyes that... '

394
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:32,016
Are you okay?

395
00:30:39,211 --> 00:30:40,360
Where am I?

396
00:30:42,256 --> 00:30:44,406
What the hell's going on?

397
00:30:54,725 --> 00:30:57,000
I can't get it open!

398
00:30:57,185 --> 00:31:00,734
Drop it or I'll slit
your mother's throat in her sleep.

399
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,198
Uhh! I got him, Lenny.
Save Crockett!

400
00:31:16,785 --> 00:31:18,741
Listen to me, Evan,
and you listen to me good.

401
00:31:18,912 --> 00:31:21,107
There's a million
other sisters in the world,

402
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:23,644
so why'd you have
to fuck with mine?

403
00:31:27,961 --> 00:31:30,077
It's okay.
It was just a dream.

404
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,478
Uh-huh...

405
00:31:33,633 --> 00:31:35,430
it didn't feel like a dream.

406
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:37,311
Maybe because
they never do.

407
00:31:38,846 --> 00:31:41,314
So, Don Juan, you pass out
on all your dates?

408
00:32:16,628 --> 00:32:18,823
Lenny...

409
00:32:19,005 --> 00:32:20,836
hey, I've got a surprise for you.

410
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:22,997
You're never gonna
guess who's here.

411
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:26,611
Hey, it's me... Evan.

412
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,412
What are you working on there?
A model?

413
00:33:07,713 --> 00:33:10,022
Look, uh...

414
00:33:10,215 --> 00:33:11,728
I can see that you're busy,

415
00:33:11,883 --> 00:33:14,113
so I'll try to make this quick.

416
00:33:14,302 --> 00:33:16,975
Remember, uh...

417
00:33:17,179 --> 00:33:19,010
that day at the junkyard

418
00:33:19,181 --> 00:33:21,376
when we were kids?

419
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:24,550
I was just hoping that you
could help me remember.

420
00:33:27,104 --> 00:33:30,813
Like, just any details about it or...

421
00:33:33,026 --> 00:33:36,018
I couldn't cut the rope.

422
00:33:36,237 --> 00:33:38,467
Yeah...

423
00:33:38,656 --> 00:33:41,329
that's good. Um...

424
00:33:41,533 --> 00:33:44,206
anything else?

425
00:33:48,706 --> 00:33:51,504
'Drop it or I'll slit
your mother's throat in her sleep! '

426
00:33:55,128 --> 00:33:56,561
Uh...

427
00:34:01,675 --> 00:34:03,506
Jesus Christ.

428
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,864
It really happened.

429
00:34:09,057 --> 00:34:11,446
Wow, uh...

430
00:34:11,642 --> 00:34:13,598
Wow, Lenny, l...

431
00:34:16,063 --> 00:34:18,293
'Make one peep

432
00:34:18,481 --> 00:34:22,235
and I swear it'll be
your last, motherfucker.'

433
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:59,084
'The last thing I remember
before the blackout

434
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:01,382
was holding my hands
over Kayleigh's ears.

435
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,994
I think I was more
focused on her hands

436
00:35:04,187 --> 00:35:07,497
on mine
than on the mailbox...

437
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:11,083
across the street.'

438
00:35:22,744 --> 00:35:25,338
Maybe it went out,
should someone check it?

439
00:35:25,538 --> 00:35:27,608
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.

440
00:35:36,464 --> 00:35:39,456
You make one peep and I swear
it'll be your last, motherfucker.

441
00:35:44,555 --> 00:35:46,147
Ugh!

442
00:35:46,306 --> 00:35:48,376
Fuck!

443
00:35:53,145 --> 00:35:56,137
What's this?
Huh? What's this?

444
00:35:58,358 --> 00:36:00,713
Want to get the mail?

445
00:36:01,903 --> 00:36:04,781
How's my sweet girl?

446
00:36:04,989 --> 00:36:06,980
How's my sweet girl?

447
00:36:07,157 --> 00:36:09,307
You need a change,
don't you, honey?

448
00:36:09,493 --> 00:36:11,165
You wanna open it?

449
00:36:11,327 --> 00:36:13,477
You wanna open it?

450
00:36:15,456 --> 00:36:17,447
- Oh my God!
- Holy shit!

451
00:36:17,624 --> 00:36:19,660
Run!

452
00:36:19,835 --> 00:36:21,951
Fuck, Lenny, come on!

453
00:36:22,128 --> 00:36:24,164
Lenny, come on!

454
00:36:24,339 --> 00:36:26,216
Come on, Lenny, let's go!

455
00:36:31,928 --> 00:36:34,396
No, baby. That's my finger
in your arse.

456
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:43,188
Christ, man.

457
00:36:43,396 --> 00:36:45,352
Fuckin' brutal!

458
00:36:47,275 --> 00:36:48,913
What the...?

459
00:36:52,613 --> 00:36:55,286
- Hello.
- Hello. Who is this?

460
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:58,607
Mrs Kagan, um,
it's Evan... Treborn.

461
00:36:58,826 --> 00:37:01,215
I hope you know
how much you upset Lenny.

462
00:37:01,412 --> 00:37:05,087
Yeah, I'm... look,
I'm really sorry about that.

463
00:37:05,332 --> 00:37:07,800
It took me over an hour
to clean up the mess you made.

464
00:37:08,001 --> 00:37:10,356
Can I just talk to Lenny?

465
00:37:10,545 --> 00:37:12,661
Don't call here.

466
00:37:20,219 --> 00:37:22,574
Mum.

467
00:37:22,763 --> 00:37:25,231
I can't help it.
I'm just so proud of you.

468
00:37:25,432 --> 00:37:28,629
Hey, did... did Dad...

469
00:37:28,852 --> 00:37:31,320
Did Jason get good grades?

470
00:37:31,521 --> 00:37:34,240
Please, he got straight As
without ever touching a book.

471
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,795
It was the one area
his memory never failed him.

472
00:37:37,401 --> 00:37:39,357
Did he ever say that he, like...

473
00:37:39,528 --> 00:37:43,487
figured out a way to recall
his lost memories

474
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:46,697
like years after he blacked them out
in the first place?

475
00:37:46,909 --> 00:37:50,140
- Why do you ask?
- No, I just figured with him being

476
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:51,883
you know, such a brain and all

477
00:37:52,038 --> 00:37:54,552
it's like, you would think
that he would figure out

478
00:37:54,749 --> 00:37:56,979
a way to remember
stuff that he forgot.

479
00:37:57,168 --> 00:37:59,238
Well, when he was your age...

480
00:37:59,419 --> 00:38:01,728
almost exactly your age
come to think of it,

481
00:38:01,922 --> 00:38:05,551
he said he figured out
a way to remember his past.

482
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,916
I couldn't tell
if they were real memories

483
00:38:08,094 --> 00:38:10,085
or just his imagination.

484
00:38:10,262 --> 00:38:14,414
Then, just before
it got so bad, he...

485
00:38:15,683 --> 00:38:17,753
had to be institutionalised,

486
00:38:17,935 --> 00:38:20,130
he said he could...

487
00:38:21,438 --> 00:38:23,906
What?

488
00:38:24,107 --> 00:38:25,859
What?

489
00:38:27,443 --> 00:38:29,161
What... what did he do?

490
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,311
Forget it.

491
00:38:31,488 --> 00:38:34,605
It's nothing.
He was far too sick by then.

492
00:38:46,418 --> 00:38:48,648
'I never wanted to be
in the movie, anyway.

493
00:38:50,129 --> 00:38:53,041
I was cold, so I wanted
to wear my clothes.

494
00:38:53,257 --> 00:38:55,168
Mr Miller took my shirt off.'

495
00:38:55,342 --> 00:38:57,173
What the fuck are you doing?

496
00:38:57,344 --> 00:38:59,812
Shhh, I need quiet for this.

497
00:39:00,013 --> 00:39:02,447
Are you stupid or what, man?

498
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,234
Maybe there's a reason
you repressed the day

499
00:39:05,434 --> 00:39:07,789
some pervert had you
in your tighty whities.

500
00:39:11,022 --> 00:39:12,899
I'd think twice
about what you're doing.

501
00:39:13,065 --> 00:39:15,420
You could wake up a lot more
fucked up than you are now.

502
00:39:15,609 --> 00:39:17,998
- More fucked up than I already am?
- No, l...

503
00:39:18,195 --> 00:39:20,151
You think you know me?
I don't know me!

504
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,466
Whoa!

505
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,366
I'm sorry.

506
00:40:02,524 --> 00:40:04,515
No, it's my fault.

507
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,809
Can we get through
one damn day

508
00:40:06,986 --> 00:40:08,578
without you
breaking something?

509
00:40:36,053 --> 00:40:38,283
Hey.

510
00:40:41,182 --> 00:40:42,695
Evan.

511
00:40:44,435 --> 00:40:47,507
Oh my God.
It's been a long time.

512
00:40:49,564 --> 00:40:51,395
How you been?

513
00:40:51,566 --> 00:40:54,034
Same old, same old,
you know?

514
00:40:54,235 --> 00:40:56,908
No, I don't know.
Fill me in.

515
00:40:57,112 --> 00:40:59,865
Uhh, well...

516
00:41:00,073 --> 00:41:02,382
I'm going to State now.

517
00:41:02,575 --> 00:41:04,805
It's going good.
My Mum's good.

518
00:41:06,037 --> 00:41:08,153
- I don't know.
- You want a smoke?

519
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,560
- No, not since we were kids.
- No?

520
00:41:10,749 --> 00:41:12,421
I've quit like 100 times.

521
00:41:16,546 --> 00:41:19,663
- Are you walking home?
- Uh-huh.

522
00:41:19,882 --> 00:41:22,077
- Can I walk you?
- Sure.

523
00:41:24,803 --> 00:41:27,112
- Oh my God.
- So...

524
00:41:29,932 --> 00:41:32,048
how's Tommy?

525
00:41:34,686 --> 00:41:37,154
Well, they kept him
in juvie for a few years,

526
00:41:37,355 --> 00:41:41,109
but now he's working
over at Dale's Auto Body.

527
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:43,314
That's good.

528
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,811
Still living with your dad?

529
00:41:46,988 --> 00:41:49,024
No.

530
00:41:49,198 --> 00:41:51,792
I emancipated myself at 15.

531
00:41:54,036 --> 00:41:55,867
Must've taken a lot of courage.

532
00:41:56,038 --> 00:41:58,393
Not if you remember my dad.

533
00:42:02,043 --> 00:42:04,603
Well, couldn't you have just
moved in with your mum?

534
00:42:05,796 --> 00:42:07,593
No, she had a new family.

535
00:42:07,756 --> 00:42:09,633
Wasn't enough room.

536
00:42:09,799 --> 00:42:11,391
Whatever.

537
00:42:11,551 --> 00:42:14,190
Well look, the reason
I came back to town

538
00:42:14,386 --> 00:42:15,944
was to talk to you.

539
00:42:16,096 --> 00:42:18,166
To me? Why?

540
00:42:19,975 --> 00:42:22,364
Well...

541
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,755
remember when we were kids

542
00:42:24,937 --> 00:42:27,497
and I used to have
those blackouts?

543
00:42:27,689 --> 00:42:29,441
Yeah, of course.

544
00:42:29,608 --> 00:42:33,317
Well, some of those memories
have been coming back to me.

545
00:42:33,569 --> 00:42:36,083
And I just...
I wanted to talk to you

546
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,316
about one of them in particular.

547
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:40,640
Well, I'll try to remember.

548
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:47,104
When we were kids, uh...

549
00:42:47,289 --> 00:42:49,359
your dad was making a movie

550
00:42:49,541 --> 00:42:52,453
about Robin Hood... something.

551
00:42:52,669 --> 00:42:54,899
What do you want
to know, Evan?!

552
00:42:59,008 --> 00:43:01,238
Is... did he...

553
00:43:02,427 --> 00:43:05,305
What happened
in the basement?

554
00:43:05,513 --> 00:43:07,390
Look, it was a long time ago.

555
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:11,181
I know.

556
00:43:11,352 --> 00:43:13,661
Is that why you came
all the way back here?

557
00:43:13,854 --> 00:43:16,573
To ask a lot of stupid questions
about Robin Hood?

558
00:43:16,773 --> 00:43:19,162
No, l...

559
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:22,555
I just think that something really bad
might have happened.

560
00:43:22,778 --> 00:43:25,053
Is there a point
to any of this?

561
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,800
Look, whatever happened
it wasn't our fault.

562
00:43:29,992 --> 00:43:32,950
We were kids. I mean, there was nothing
that we could do to deserve...

563
00:43:33,162 --> 00:43:35,278
Just shut up, Evan!

564
00:43:35,455 --> 00:43:37,411
You're wasting your breath.

565
00:43:37,582 --> 00:43:40,335
You can't hate yourself 'cause
your dad's a twisted freak.

566
00:43:40,543 --> 00:43:44,058
Who are you trying
to convince, Evan?

567
00:43:44,296 --> 00:43:46,446
You come all the way back here
to stir up my shit

568
00:43:46,632 --> 00:43:48,782
just because you have
a bad memory?

569
00:43:48,967 --> 00:43:51,356
What, do you want me to just cry
on your shoulder

570
00:43:51,552 --> 00:43:53,747
and tell you everything's
all better now?

571
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:56,000
Well, fuck you, Evan!

572
00:43:56,181 --> 00:43:58,536
Nothing's all better, okay?

573
00:43:58,725 --> 00:44:00,636
Nothing ever gets better.

574
00:44:04,272 --> 00:44:06,945
You know, if I was
so wonderful, Evan,

575
00:44:07,149 --> 00:44:08,946
why didn't you call me?

576
00:44:09,109 --> 00:44:11,464
Why did you just
leave me here to rot?

577
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:31,018
When he was your age... almost exactly
your age, come to think of it...

578
00:44:31,253 --> 00:44:34,290
he said he figured out a way
to remember his past.

579
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:40,117
Some dude left
a message for you.

580
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:42,611
You can smell that all the way
to the bathroom.

581
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:47,824
Hi, Evan, this is Professor Carter.

582
00:44:48,017 --> 00:44:50,929
I just wondered why you didn't
hand in your essay this afternoon.

583
00:44:51,145 --> 00:44:53,784
I was a bit concerned.
Call me to schedule a make-up.

584
00:44:56,524 --> 00:44:59,755
What'd you say
to my sister, motherfucker?

585
00:44:59,986 --> 00:45:02,944
Last night she cried on the phone
for over an hour to me.

586
00:45:03,155 --> 00:45:06,067
She said you came
and saw her last night.

587
00:45:06,283 --> 00:45:07,921
She...

588
00:45:08,076 --> 00:45:10,874
she fucking
killed herself tonight.

589
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:12,990
She's dead...

590
00:45:13,164 --> 00:45:15,883
and so are you!

591
00:46:33,982 --> 00:46:35,893
'If the scar on my stomach

592
00:46:36,068 --> 00:46:38,059
didn't just come out of nowhere,

593
00:46:38,236 --> 00:46:40,750
maybe my father wasn't
as crazy as everyone thought.

594
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,191
If I can make scars, do I have
the power to heal them?

595
00:46:48,453 --> 00:46:50,728
What about Kayleigh's scars? '

596
00:46:56,335 --> 00:46:59,372
'I never wanted
to be in the movie, anyway.

597
00:46:59,588 --> 00:47:04,184
It was cold, so I wanted
to wear my clothes.

598
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:10,389
But Mr Miller took my shirt off.'

599
00:47:22,232 --> 00:47:24,348
I've got an idea.
Let's go down to the basement.

600
00:47:24,525 --> 00:47:26,914
It'll look more like
a dungeon down there.

601
00:47:28,862 --> 00:47:31,740
A little light here.

602
00:47:31,948 --> 00:47:34,018
Huh?

603
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:38,538
Hey, now what did I tell you
about keeping that door shut?

604
00:47:38,746 --> 00:47:40,259
But I wanna see.

605
00:47:40,414 --> 00:47:42,882
You're going to see the back of my fist
in about two seconds

606
00:47:43,083 --> 00:47:44,880
if you don't do what I tell you.

607
00:47:47,003 --> 00:47:49,517
Now, in this part of the story,

608
00:47:49,714 --> 00:47:52,945
Robin Hood has just
married Maid Marian

609
00:47:53,175 --> 00:47:56,212
and they have to kiss and stuff,

610
00:47:56,428 --> 00:47:58,384
like the grown-ups do.

611
00:47:58,554 --> 00:48:00,863
So, take off
your clothes, Kayleigh.

612
00:48:04,476 --> 00:48:06,910
Come on, just like
when we take a bath.

613
00:48:07,103 --> 00:48:09,412
Don't make a big deal out of it.
You too, Evan.

614
00:48:11,148 --> 00:48:14,743
Come on, let's go. Let's go.
We're making a movie here.

615
00:48:14,985 --> 00:48:17,340
Put your hands on your ears.

616
00:48:19,822 --> 00:48:22,211
What time is it?

617
00:48:22,408 --> 00:48:26,560
It's time for you to do
what I tell you to do.

618
00:48:26,828 --> 00:48:28,784
Wrong answer, fuckbag!

619
00:48:28,955 --> 00:48:31,594
This is the very moment
of your reckoning.

620
00:48:31,791 --> 00:48:34,828
In the next 30 seconds, you're going
to open up one of two doors.

621
00:48:35,044 --> 00:48:38,514
The first door will forever
traumatise your own flesh and blood.

622
00:48:38,755 --> 00:48:41,349
What... what's happening?

623
00:48:41,549 --> 00:48:43,665
How are you doing this?

624
00:48:43,843 --> 00:48:45,913
It'll change your daughter

625
00:48:46,095 --> 00:48:47,892
from a beautiful child

626
00:48:48,055 --> 00:48:50,205
into an empty shell

627
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:52,187
whose only concept of trust

628
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:55,626
was betrayed by her own
sick paedophile father!

629
00:48:55,853 --> 00:48:57,650
Ultimately...

630
00:48:57,813 --> 00:48:59,485
it'll lead to her suicide.

631
00:48:59,648 --> 00:49:02,116
- Nice work, Daddy.
- Who are you?

632
00:49:02,317 --> 00:49:05,753
Let's just say you're being
closely watched, George!

633
00:49:05,987 --> 00:49:08,899
Your other option is
to treat Kayleigh like...

634
00:49:09,114 --> 00:49:11,389
say like a loving father
treats his daughter.

635
00:49:12,826 --> 00:49:14,737
Sound okay to you, Papa?

636
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,114
Yes.

637
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:19,840
Listen close then, fuckbag.

638
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,758
You screw this up again,

639
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,556
I'll flat out castrate you.

640
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:29,413
What you need to do
is discipline your son Tommy,

641
00:49:29,632 --> 00:49:32,226
because the kid
is one sadistic pup.

642
00:49:33,427 --> 00:49:34,906
One last thing.

643
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:44,020
Don't ever touch me again!

644
00:49:45,979 --> 00:49:47,537
L... I won't.

645
00:50:07,748 --> 00:50:09,147
Ahhh!

646
00:50:09,291 --> 00:50:11,088
Faster, faster!

647
00:50:13,878 --> 00:50:15,470
Crockett!

648
00:50:16,672 --> 00:50:18,230
Kayleigh, I can't believe
you came!

649
00:50:19,633 --> 00:50:21,225
I think you got one.

650
00:50:21,384 --> 00:50:23,102
Check out our new house.

651
00:50:25,346 --> 00:50:27,416
- Forever.
- Hell or high water.

652
00:50:32,435 --> 00:50:34,073
Honey, are you alright?

653
00:50:37,064 --> 00:50:39,180
Oh my god, Evan,
you're bleeding.

654
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:41,826
Kayleigh, you're still... You...

655
00:50:45,655 --> 00:50:47,373
Incredible.

656
00:50:47,532 --> 00:50:51,002
Well, thanks. Go get cleaned up
and come back to bed.

657
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:55,850
Ohh. Where are my clothes?

658
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,150
Those are your clothes, silly.

659
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:06,483
The bathroom is...

660
00:51:12,303 --> 00:51:15,136
Hurry up. I want a quickie
before school.

661
00:51:53,421 --> 00:51:55,332
What?

662
00:51:57,091 --> 00:51:58,683
Unfucking believable.

663
00:51:59,843 --> 00:52:01,196
Alright.

664
00:52:01,344 --> 00:52:03,574
I wish I could get as excited
over a nosebleed.

665
00:52:04,972 --> 00:52:08,169
Sorry, uh, I didn't
see you there.

666
00:52:10,978 --> 00:52:12,570
What?

667
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:15,641
You're the girl that
was with those arseholes

668
00:52:15,857 --> 00:52:17,848
throwing popcorn at Thumper.

669
00:52:18,025 --> 00:52:19,936
What?

670
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:22,783
And your name is Gwen.

671
00:52:22,988 --> 00:52:24,421
I know you.

672
00:52:26,366 --> 00:52:28,880
Seriously, Evan,
lay off the blow.

673
00:52:33,205 --> 00:52:34,957
- Hi.
- Hi.

674
00:52:40,419 --> 00:52:42,569
Hey, um...

675
00:52:42,755 --> 00:52:45,349
don't freak out
when I ask you this, but...

676
00:52:47,133 --> 00:52:50,125
do you remember when your dad
got that video camera?

677
00:52:50,344 --> 00:52:51,663
What's up, man?

678
00:52:51,804 --> 00:52:54,238
Yeah, um...

679
00:52:54,431 --> 00:52:56,899
I think he had it like
the first day

680
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:59,056
and then he gave it away
or something.

681
00:52:59,227 --> 00:53:01,138
Why would that freak me out?

682
00:53:02,563 --> 00:53:04,076
I don't know.

683
00:53:04,231 --> 00:53:06,301
Just being weird.

684
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:08,553
You are such a goofus.

685
00:53:11,237 --> 00:53:13,307
So I'll see you tonight.

686
00:53:13,489 --> 00:53:15,207
Okay.

687
00:53:36,967 --> 00:53:38,366
- Andrea...
- Evan...

688
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:40,740
- and Chuck...
- aren't home right now.

689
00:53:40,929 --> 00:53:42,760
You know what to do.

690
00:53:42,931 --> 00:53:44,649
Uh, hey, Mum.

691
00:53:44,807 --> 00:53:47,799
It's me. And hey, Chuck.

692
00:53:48,018 --> 00:53:50,976
Ah, I'm just calling
to say hi, I guess.

693
00:53:51,188 --> 00:53:52,985
Give me a call back.

694
00:53:56,651 --> 00:53:59,609
Hey, Thumper, do you know
what time it is, man?

695
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,095
What's the matter,
you lost your Rolex?

696
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:05,078
Fuck you, frat boy!

697
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:10,762
Remember, everyone,
there's only two more weeks

698
00:54:10,955 --> 00:54:13,264
until your psych projects
are due.

699
00:54:13,457 --> 00:54:16,335
Uh, about that essay
I missed last week,

700
00:54:16,543 --> 00:54:18,818
we're still okay
with the extension, right?

701
00:54:19,003 --> 00:54:20,755
And you are?

702
00:54:20,921 --> 00:54:23,310
Evan... Treborn.

703
00:54:23,507 --> 00:54:25,304
Well, the answer's no, Mr Treborn.

704
00:54:25,467 --> 00:54:27,981
Now please take your seat.
The exam is about to begin.

705
00:54:33,641 --> 00:54:35,711
Alright, settle down, everyone.

706
00:54:35,893 --> 00:54:38,407
The exam will begin
in one minute.

707
00:54:42,898 --> 00:54:44,570
Get off me, arsehole.

708
00:54:44,733 --> 00:54:47,008
You guys started that shit.

709
00:54:47,194 --> 00:54:49,662
Evan, you're hysterical.

710
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:53,628
Did you study for this?

711
00:54:55,618 --> 00:54:57,336
Oh, uh...

712
00:54:57,494 --> 00:54:59,450
we'll find out.

713
00:54:59,621 --> 00:55:01,452
Me neither.

714
00:55:13,133 --> 00:55:14,851
Holy shit!
Are these the answers?

715
00:55:15,009 --> 00:55:16,601
Damn, Evan,
keep it on the dl.

716
00:55:23,433 --> 00:55:25,264
Hey, uh...

717
00:55:25,435 --> 00:55:28,905
I want to do something special
for Kayleigh tomorrow night.

718
00:55:29,146 --> 00:55:32,456
Uh, so if I said that I needed

719
00:55:32,691 --> 00:55:34,921
some help from you
and the brothers...

720
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:37,499
I'd say, 'blow me.'

721
00:55:39,322 --> 00:55:41,836
Get the pledges to do it.

722
00:55:42,032 --> 00:55:44,592
- Right, the pledges.
- Yeah.

723
00:55:44,784 --> 00:55:47,298
You may begin now.

724
00:56:04,259 --> 00:56:06,853
Oh, that was so good.

725
00:56:08,221 --> 00:56:10,098
Oh my God.

726
00:56:11,349 --> 00:56:13,465
Where'd you learn
those new tricks?

727
00:56:15,019 --> 00:56:16,816
Why?

728
00:56:16,979 --> 00:56:19,937
It... it wasn't weird, was it?

729
00:56:21,691 --> 00:56:24,364
Yeah, if you call
multiple orgasms weird.

730
00:56:33,826 --> 00:56:35,259
Hello?

731
00:56:37,413 --> 00:56:39,404
- Fuck 'em.
- Hello?

732
00:56:45,211 --> 00:56:46,439
Oh.

733
00:56:50,882 --> 00:56:53,680
What do you think
it is about us

734
00:56:53,885 --> 00:56:57,844
that makes us so perfect?

735
00:56:59,765 --> 00:57:02,643
I mean...

736
00:57:02,851 --> 00:57:05,206
why did you sneak out

737
00:57:05,395 --> 00:57:08,148
to visit me
after I moved away?

738
00:57:08,356 --> 00:57:10,108
'Cause I missed you.

739
00:57:12,651 --> 00:57:15,324
What, do you think my dad could have
stopped me from seeing you?

740
00:57:16,654 --> 00:57:18,053
What's he gonna do?

741
00:57:20,908 --> 00:57:23,024
Oh, my gosh.
My toes are numb.

742
00:57:24,578 --> 00:57:27,092
Do you think that we'll
be together forever?

743
00:57:32,168 --> 00:57:34,045
That is the plan, isn't it?

744
00:57:35,921 --> 00:57:37,912
'Hell or high water'?

745
00:57:38,089 --> 00:57:39,841
Yeah.

746
00:57:40,008 --> 00:57:41,964
Yeah, that's...

747
00:57:42,134 --> 00:57:43,806
I was just making sure.

748
00:57:46,513 --> 00:57:49,266
Yeah, that's the plan!

749
00:57:59,274 --> 00:58:02,311
Alright, uh...

750
00:58:02,527 --> 00:58:06,361
all you rushes, you know
what you have to do for me.

751
00:58:06,614 --> 00:58:08,366
Pledges, uh...

752
00:58:08,532 --> 00:58:10,284
we're pledges, sir.

753
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:13,283
Uh, brother Evan, sir.

754
00:58:15,413 --> 00:58:16,892
Are you kidding me?

755
00:58:20,751 --> 00:58:22,742
What?
What did you say to me?

756
00:58:22,919 --> 00:58:25,387
You know what, give me the Greek
alphabet. Give it to me!

757
00:58:25,588 --> 00:58:26,987
- Uhh-uhh.
- Uhh-uhh.

758
00:58:27,131 --> 00:58:28,803
- Alpha, beta...
- Alpha, beta, gamma, delta...

759
00:58:28,966 --> 00:58:31,116
epsilon, zeta, eta, theta,
iota, kappa, lambda, mu, nu, xi,

760
00:58:31,301 --> 00:58:33,940
omicron, pi, rho, sigma, tau,
upsilon, phi, chi, psi, omega, Sir.

761
00:58:34,137 --> 00:58:36,970
Maybe that's what it is.
Don't fucking look at me, look down.

762
00:58:41,894 --> 00:58:43,247
Uh...

763
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:47,141
alright, um...

764
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:51,455
so, you... you pledges

765
00:58:51,652 --> 00:58:54,450
you guys know what
you need to do for me.

766
00:58:54,654 --> 00:58:56,372
And you guys take a shower

767
00:58:56,531 --> 00:58:58,601
and if anyone
gives you any trouble,

768
00:58:58,783 --> 00:59:00,375
you tell 'em I said it was okay.

769
00:59:03,954 --> 00:59:05,785
What?

770
00:59:09,584 --> 00:59:11,700
Shower that, bitch.

771
00:59:16,048 --> 00:59:18,608
I don't understand.
Where are you taking me?

772
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,950
I'm not telling.

773
00:59:30,393 --> 00:59:32,702
Oh my God!

774
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:41,005
Wow, it's beautiful.

775
00:59:41,194 --> 00:59:43,913
Go on, sit down.

776
00:59:45,197 --> 00:59:46,789
Thank you.

777
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:51,226
! You gave us
some place to go!

778
00:59:52,829 --> 00:59:56,344
! I never said
thank you for that...!

779
00:59:57,833 --> 00:59:59,232
Why are you doing this for me?

780
01:00:00,877 --> 01:00:02,469
When I woke up this morning...

781
01:00:04,339 --> 01:00:06,250
I saw your smile.

782
01:00:07,425 --> 01:00:09,097
That smile.

783
01:00:10,427 --> 01:00:11,906
And I knew

784
01:00:12,054 --> 01:00:15,012
that I wanted to spend
the rest of my life

785
01:00:15,223 --> 01:00:16,975
with you.

786
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:21,665
! Now I'll never
have a chance!

787
01:00:21,854 --> 01:00:25,927
! May angels
lead you in...!

788
01:00:30,236 --> 01:00:32,431
I've been looking
all over for you, man.

789
01:00:32,613 --> 01:00:33,966
Someone trashed your car.

790
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:43,281
What the...

791
01:00:44,623 --> 01:00:46,420
Who did this?!

792
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:48,574
Who did it?!

793
01:00:48,752 --> 01:00:50,947
It was probably
those Beta fuckers.

794
01:00:51,129 --> 01:00:53,085
No, no, no.

795
01:00:53,255 --> 01:00:55,405
How did somebody
get away with this

796
01:00:55,591 --> 01:00:57,502
right in front
of the frat house?

797
01:00:59,344 --> 01:01:03,132
- Dude, what is that, a dog collar?
- Tommy.

798
01:01:05,641 --> 01:01:07,597
Don't.

799
01:01:08,769 --> 01:01:10,441
He might be watching.

800
01:01:11,604 --> 01:01:13,117
It's my fault.

801
01:01:13,272 --> 01:01:15,740
I should have told you
he was released a few weeks ago.

802
01:01:15,941 --> 01:01:17,613
Yeah, it might have been nice.

803
01:01:21,946 --> 01:01:23,174
God.

804
01:01:28,827 --> 01:01:31,057
Like this is gonna
do any good.

805
01:01:31,246 --> 01:01:33,396
Maybe one of the frat guys
has got a gun.

806
01:01:33,581 --> 01:01:35,492
Evan, don't even joke!

807
01:01:35,666 --> 01:01:37,304
He's not going
to hurt you, okay?

808
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,416
He's just trying to scare you
away from me.

809
01:01:39,586 --> 01:01:41,861
He killed my dog.

810
01:01:42,047 --> 01:01:44,880
- You don't remember that?
- Evan, it's not his fault.

811
01:01:45,091 --> 01:01:47,525
You know how bad he had it
when we were kids.

812
01:01:47,718 --> 01:01:51,267
Oh no, don't give me
this bad upbringing shit.

813
01:01:51,513 --> 01:01:53,071
You turned out just fine.

814
01:01:53,223 --> 01:01:55,373
My father never
laid a hand on me.

815
01:01:55,558 --> 01:01:58,834
It's like that prick
saved it all up for Tommy.

816
01:02:03,857 --> 01:02:07,736
Okay. Alright. Uh...

817
01:02:09,987 --> 01:02:13,616
We'll let campus security
deal with it. Okay?

818
01:02:15,242 --> 01:02:17,551
You know what?
I think I should sleep alone.

819
01:02:19,537 --> 01:02:22,176
No, you're not staying alone.
I'm staying with you.

820
01:02:22,373 --> 01:02:24,489
Evan, I just... I don't want Tommy

821
01:02:24,666 --> 01:02:26,179
to see us together right now.

822
01:02:26,335 --> 01:02:29,486
No, I lost you once
and I'm not losing you again.

823
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:31,304
What do you mean
you lost me once?

824
01:02:31,464 --> 01:02:34,217
Evan, you've never lost me.
What are you talking about?

825
01:02:34,425 --> 01:02:37,337
God, you've been
acting so weird lately.

826
01:02:37,552 --> 01:02:41,067
Look, my car just got wrecked, okay?
I'm kind of freaking out.

827
01:02:41,306 --> 01:02:43,820
I know that, but...

828
01:02:44,016 --> 01:02:45,574
your accent's changed.

829
01:02:45,726 --> 01:02:48,763
- You don't even walk the same.
- What, I walk differently?

830
01:02:48,979 --> 01:02:50,935
I mean, that dinner tonight,

831
01:02:51,106 --> 01:02:52,903
it was so beautiful.
It was gorgeous.

832
01:02:53,066 --> 01:02:54,977
But it just wasn't you.

833
01:02:55,151 --> 01:02:57,665
I can't do
something nice for you?

834
01:02:58,904 --> 01:03:01,099
Wait...

835
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:03,112
isn't that your jacket?

836
01:03:13,208 --> 01:03:14,800
Tommy!

837
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,030
You stay away from us,
you sick fuck.

838
01:03:18,212 --> 01:03:20,407
Oh, get this 'us' shit.

839
01:03:20,589 --> 01:03:22,944
Like I'd ever lay a hand
on my own sister.

840
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:25,488
You're doing real nice
for yourself, Evan.

841
01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:27,633
You've got a nice life,

842
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,522
you got nice friends,

843
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,796
not to mention
you're fucking my sister.

844
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:34,442
Not a bad piece of arse
if I say so myself.

845
01:03:34,643 --> 01:03:37,441
- Shut up, Tommy!
- Oh, come on. That's a compliment.

846
01:03:37,645 --> 01:03:39,442
What are you doing, man?
What the fuck?

847
01:03:39,605 --> 01:03:42,403
Oh, it's not good enough that
the whole fucking world loves you?

848
01:03:42,608 --> 01:03:44,678
But you've got to take
the only thing on this Earth

849
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:46,737
that doesn't think
that I'm a piece of shit?

850
01:03:46,903 --> 01:03:48,302
You know I love you.

851
01:03:48,446 --> 01:03:50,596
No one thinks that
you're a piece of shit, Tom.

852
01:03:50,781 --> 01:03:53,898
What was it you said?
I think I believe it was, 'sick fuck'!

853
01:03:54,118 --> 01:03:55,995
Don't! Tommy!

854
01:03:58,872 --> 01:04:00,191
Stop!

855
01:04:00,331 --> 01:04:01,844
Stop!

856
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,719
Stop! Oh my God!

857
01:04:07,963 --> 01:04:09,601
Stop!

858
01:04:09,756 --> 01:04:11,633
Oh my God!

859
01:04:11,799 --> 01:04:13,437
Oh!

860
01:04:15,094 --> 01:04:16,846
No, Evan!

861
01:04:17,012 --> 01:04:18,161
Stop!

862
01:04:18,305 --> 01:04:19,340
Stop it!

863
01:04:19,473 --> 01:04:22,510
- You're gonna kill him!
- He's a fuckin' maniac!

864
01:04:23,851 --> 01:04:25,682
Don't do this,
I'm begging you!

865
01:04:25,853 --> 01:04:27,525
You ruined Lenny's life!

866
01:04:29,314 --> 01:04:30,667
You killed Crockett!

867
01:04:30,816 --> 01:04:32,647
You killed
that woman and her baby!

868
01:04:34,027 --> 01:04:36,222
Now you're trying to kill me.

869
01:04:36,404 --> 01:04:38,998
Just tryin' to fucking kill me!

870
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:53,616
Oh my God!

871
01:04:53,793 --> 01:04:56,182
Oh my God,
what did you do?

872
01:04:57,505 --> 01:04:59,735
Oh my God!

873
01:05:30,742 --> 01:05:32,380
You right there, faggot!

874
01:06:00,308 --> 01:06:02,583
First time?

875
01:06:02,769 --> 01:06:04,282
Yeah.

876
01:06:05,896 --> 01:06:07,807
You'd better not
bitch up, man.

877
01:06:07,982 --> 01:06:10,371
You'll wind up someone's
luggage that way.

878
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:18,039
Can you protect me?

879
01:06:18,199 --> 01:06:19,837
Jesus himself

880
01:06:19,992 --> 01:06:22,426
couldn't make me stand up
against the brotherhood.

881
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,876
Look, man...

882
01:06:37,048 --> 01:06:39,357
when they come,

883
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:42,508
you go someplace else
in your head, man.

884
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:44,949
Be somewhere else.

885
01:07:02,236 --> 01:07:04,113
Back your arse up.

886
01:07:16,123 --> 01:07:18,432
Yo, gimme that.

887
01:07:34,972 --> 01:07:38,009
I spoke to your lawyer.

888
01:07:38,225 --> 01:07:40,455
And he says he's sure

889
01:07:40,644 --> 01:07:42,521
he can get you off
on self-defence.

890
01:07:42,687 --> 01:07:44,643
So if you're just patient...

891
01:07:44,814 --> 01:07:47,567
Mum...

892
01:07:47,775 --> 01:07:49,447
How long am I gonna
be in here?

893
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:51,680
I don't know.

894
01:07:51,862 --> 01:07:54,740
These things take time.

895
01:07:54,948 --> 01:07:56,586
What about the journals?

896
01:07:56,741 --> 01:07:58,697
Did you bring the ones
I asked you to bring?

897
01:07:58,868 --> 01:08:01,905
I found these two.

898
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,997
The others are still in storage.

899
01:08:05,165 --> 01:08:08,237
Mum! L...

900
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:13,570
I need them all,

901
01:08:13,714 --> 01:08:15,306
all of them.

902
01:08:15,465 --> 01:08:17,376
And I'm going
to get them to you,

903
01:08:17,550 --> 01:08:21,589
but right now, you need
to concentrate on the case.

904
01:08:24,931 --> 01:08:26,649
Please.

905
01:08:29,185 --> 01:08:31,062
Alright.

906
01:08:31,228 --> 01:08:33,059
You're right.

907
01:08:37,234 --> 01:08:39,543
What about Kayleigh?

908
01:08:39,736 --> 01:08:41,692
Is she alright?

909
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,077
Try to tell her I'm sorry.

910
01:08:50,912 --> 01:08:52,982
Time's up.

911
01:08:53,164 --> 01:08:54,756
I'm not going
to lose you, kiddo.

912
01:08:54,915 --> 01:08:56,792
Promise me you'll hang on.

913
01:09:12,138 --> 01:09:14,777
Shit on my dick
or blood on my knife.

914
01:09:23,690 --> 01:09:25,248
They're mine...

915
01:09:39,203 --> 01:09:40,921
Come on!

916
01:09:42,873 --> 01:09:45,990
Back the fuck off!

917
01:09:46,209 --> 01:09:47,642
Show's over, ladies!

918
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,393
Put this maggot
back in his cell.

919
01:09:52,548 --> 01:09:55,267
Move it!
Come on, let's go!

920
01:10:11,147 --> 01:10:13,741
We'll be seeing you
later on tonight, little sister.

921
01:10:43,195 --> 01:10:45,231
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

922
01:10:46,448 --> 01:10:47,847
Come on, Reese.

923
01:10:54,329 --> 01:10:55,842
You're religious, Carlos,

924
01:10:55,998 --> 01:10:57,795
you believe in that whole bit,

925
01:10:57,958 --> 01:11:00,347
the Lord works
in mysterious ways?

926
01:11:00,543 --> 01:11:02,738
Straight up, man.

927
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:06,435
'Cause I think Jesus sent me
to your cell for a reason.

928
01:11:06,673 --> 01:11:09,062
For you to help me.

929
01:11:10,927 --> 01:11:13,157
Shit.

930
01:11:13,346 --> 01:11:15,098
I knew you were crazy, man.

931
01:11:15,264 --> 01:11:16,583
I ain't bullshitting you.

932
01:11:16,723 --> 01:11:18,600
Jesus speaks to me
in my dreams.

933
01:11:18,767 --> 01:11:20,917
Oh, yeah?

934
01:11:21,102 --> 01:11:23,741
That's cool. Great.

935
01:11:23,938 --> 01:11:26,930
A pack of smokes says
I can prove it to you.

936
01:11:31,278 --> 01:11:34,509
When I'm out, I need you to watch
my hands and face closely.

937
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:38,550
You need to see
the prison shrink, man.

938
01:11:38,742 --> 01:11:41,210
Just tell me if you see
anything just... weird.

939
01:11:42,621 --> 01:11:44,373
Weirder than this?

940
01:11:44,539 --> 01:11:46,257
It could be marks.
It could be scars.

941
01:11:46,415 --> 01:11:49,009
It could be anything,
I don't know.

942
01:11:50,377 --> 01:11:53,574
'On Wednesday, I got in trouble
for a drawing I didn't do.

943
01:11:53,797 --> 01:11:55,867
Mummy won't let me see it.

944
01:12:10,686 --> 01:12:14,281
Hey, no monkey business, Evan.
Sit down and finish your drawing.

945
01:12:18,568 --> 01:12:19,842
That's great, everyone.

946
01:12:19,986 --> 01:12:21,897
Just imagine
what you want to be.

947
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:23,743
There's no limits.

948
01:12:33,581 --> 01:12:35,936
Oh, Mrs Boswell.

949
01:12:39,377 --> 01:12:41,572
Sweet Jesus, it's a miracle!

950
01:12:41,754 --> 01:12:43,984
Look, it's stigmata, man!

951
01:12:44,173 --> 01:12:46,050
What'd you see?
What'd it look like?

952
01:12:46,216 --> 01:12:49,492
The signs of the Lord, man.
They just come out of nowhere.

953
01:12:49,719 --> 01:12:51,630
Man, I thought you were...

954
01:12:51,804 --> 01:12:53,920
I though you were
fucking crazy, man.

955
01:12:55,391 --> 01:12:57,222
So now you believe me.

956
01:12:58,769 --> 01:13:00,361
Straight up, man.

957
01:13:12,489 --> 01:13:14,286
Wanna make a deal?

958
01:13:17,118 --> 01:13:19,507
Alright, look. I'm new here,

959
01:13:19,703 --> 01:13:21,455
but I think I get
how things work.

960
01:13:23,290 --> 01:13:25,326
You either join a gang
or you're dead.

961
01:13:27,752 --> 01:13:30,550
Well, I sure as fuck ain't joining up with no
spics or niggers.

962
01:13:32,631 --> 01:13:34,861
And I don't want to die.

963
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:37,166
So...

964
01:13:39,887 --> 01:13:41,445
what do I gotta do?

965
01:13:42,931 --> 01:13:46,162
I'm the new guy.
I've got to work my way up, so...

966
01:13:47,644 --> 01:13:49,600
should I...

967
01:13:49,770 --> 01:13:51,522
suck your dick now...

968
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:54,817
or...

969
01:13:58,528 --> 01:14:01,440
Is your blood pure?

970
01:14:01,656 --> 01:14:03,931
Well, I ain't no fucking kike,

971
01:14:04,116 --> 01:14:05,515
if that's what you're asking me.

972
01:14:05,659 --> 01:14:08,378
Well then, let's see
what you got, honey.

973
01:14:08,578 --> 01:14:11,456
Watch the fucking teeth
or you'll be leaving without 'em.

974
01:14:11,664 --> 01:14:13,063
Yes, Sir.

975
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:23,842
Come to daddy.

976
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:30,039
Carlos!

977
01:14:36,185 --> 01:14:38,062
'We took the woods
behind the junkyard

978
01:14:38,228 --> 01:14:40,264
just to make sure we wouldn't
bump into Tommy!

979
01:14:40,439 --> 01:14:42,953
We hadn't seen
the smoke yet.'

980
01:14:43,149 --> 01:14:44,901
Hold 'em. Hold 'em.

981
01:14:45,067 --> 01:14:46,819
'We took the woods
behind the junkyard

982
01:14:46,986 --> 01:14:49,022
just to make sure we wouldn't
bump into Tommy.

983
01:14:49,196 --> 01:14:50,914
We hadn't seen
the smoke yet.'

984
01:14:54,826 --> 01:14:57,056
Rot in hell,
you fucking animals!

985
01:14:58,829 --> 01:15:01,297
Wait, before we...

986
01:15:01,498 --> 01:15:03,853
we need something
that could open the sack.

987
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:16,595
I want you to take this, Lenny.

988
01:15:16,761 --> 01:15:18,717
Today's your day of atonement.

989
01:15:18,888 --> 01:15:21,482
I know how guilty you feel
about that woman and her baby.

990
01:15:21,682 --> 01:15:23,798
Evan, stop it.
It's not the time.

991
01:15:23,976 --> 01:15:27,013
Now's the only time! Today you get
a chance to redeem yourself,

992
01:15:27,228 --> 01:15:29,105
to start all over with a clean slate.

993
01:15:29,272 --> 01:15:31,911
- What are you talking about?
- Evan, you're acting crazy.

994
01:15:32,107 --> 01:15:35,304
Please, if you've ever trusted me before,
trust me on this one.

995
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:40,872
Cut the rope.

996
01:15:44,576 --> 01:15:46,055
Come on.

997
01:15:48,079 --> 01:15:50,877
- Listen to me good, Evan.
- I'll do whatever you want.

998
01:15:51,082 --> 01:15:53,516
You don't want me to see
Kayleigh ever again, fine.

999
01:15:53,709 --> 01:15:55,347
Just let Crockett go.

1000
01:15:55,502 --> 01:15:57,299
Besides, if you kill him now,

1001
01:15:57,462 --> 01:15:59,293
they'll stick you
in juvie for sure.

1002
01:15:59,464 --> 01:16:02,297
And I know you'd never leave
your sister alone with your father.

1003
01:16:13,351 --> 01:16:14,704
Lenny, no!

1004
01:16:18,188 --> 01:16:19,507
Oh God.

1005
01:16:22,108 --> 01:16:23,939
Oh God, Lenny.

1006
01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:25,941
I said cut the rope.

1007
01:16:49,465 --> 01:16:51,774
It's all backwards.

1008
01:16:59,098 --> 01:17:03,410
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1009
01:17:03,685 --> 01:17:05,038
Evan...

1010
01:17:08,648 --> 01:17:10,764
What the fuck?

1011
01:17:15,279 --> 01:17:16,758
Lenny, no!

1012
01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:20,503
Want a ride?

1013
01:17:21,826 --> 01:17:23,498
Lenny!

1014
01:17:27,497 --> 01:17:30,011
Somebody call 911!

1015
01:17:30,208 --> 01:17:32,881
Evan! Evan!
Fuck! Evan!

1016
01:17:40,008 --> 01:17:41,600
Hey, doc.

1017
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,751
What's the damage?

1018
01:17:43,928 --> 01:17:46,317
- How much time do I got?
- Cute, Evan.

1019
01:17:46,514 --> 01:17:50,427
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen
results like these before.

1020
01:17:50,684 --> 01:17:53,482
Not even with my father?

1021
01:17:53,686 --> 01:17:57,315
Well, actually, they didn't
have these tests 20 years ago.

1022
01:17:57,565 --> 01:17:59,237
So, what did you find?

1023
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:02,153
We're finding most of
the haemorrhaging is coming from here,

1024
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:04,316
the outer layer
of the cerebral cortex.

1025
01:18:04,487 --> 01:18:06,205
That's where
the memories are stored.

1026
01:18:06,364 --> 01:18:07,683
- Thank you, Evan.
- Uh-huh.

1027
01:18:07,823 --> 01:18:09,222
I've never seen
anything like it.

1028
01:18:09,366 --> 01:18:12,005
We compared these
to the ones taken last year.

1029
01:18:12,202 --> 01:18:15,160
We found severe haemorrhaging
and massive neural reconstruction.

1030
01:18:15,371 --> 01:18:16,804
What does that mean for Evan?

1031
01:18:16,956 --> 01:18:18,787
What he's saying, Mum,
is that I've jammed

1032
01:18:18,958 --> 01:18:21,313
40 years worth of memories
into my head in the last year.

1033
01:18:21,502 --> 01:18:24,096
It's overload city. I've completely
reprogrammed my brain.

1034
01:18:24,296 --> 01:18:27,208
- That about the gist of it, doc?
- Yeah.

1035
01:18:30,343 --> 01:18:32,811
Alright, I'm going
to go wait in the car.

1036
01:18:33,011 --> 01:18:35,400
The light in here is kind
of bugging my eyes, so...

1037
01:18:35,597 --> 01:18:38,065
It was good seeing you, doc.
It really was.

1038
01:18:38,266 --> 01:18:41,099
It was very... very informative.

1039
01:18:41,310 --> 01:18:43,619
But, you know,
I got people to see

1040
01:18:43,812 --> 01:18:46,451
and things to read.

1041
01:18:46,648 --> 01:18:48,445
Alright, see ya.

1042
01:19:20,385 --> 01:19:21,659
Hey.

1043
01:19:24,597 --> 01:19:26,076
It's me...

1044
01:19:26,223 --> 01:19:28,100
Evan.

1045
01:19:28,267 --> 01:19:30,827
Can I get you anything?

1046
01:19:33,271 --> 01:19:35,227
What about...
what about some of those

1047
01:19:35,398 --> 01:19:37,434
model airplanes you like, huh?

1048
01:19:38,609 --> 01:19:40,122
I bet I can get a shitload

1049
01:19:40,277 --> 01:19:42,586
of those model airplanes up in here.

1050
01:19:44,823 --> 01:19:46,415
Lenny.

1051
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:56,515
You knew the whole time,
didn't you?

1052
01:19:59,585 --> 01:20:03,863
When you put that shard
in my hand...

1053
01:20:06,383 --> 01:20:09,420
you knew something big
was going to happen.

1054
01:20:09,635 --> 01:20:11,990
Didn't you?

1055
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:15,660
Yeah...

1056
01:20:15,849 --> 01:20:18,921
- I knew.
- Then you should be where I am.

1057
01:20:22,730 --> 01:20:25,563
You should be

1058
01:20:25,774 --> 01:20:27,605
where I am.

1059
01:20:46,834 --> 01:20:49,792
'Today I get to meet my father.

1060
01:20:51,004 --> 01:20:52,835
His name is Jason...

1061
01:20:54,132 --> 01:20:55,850
and he's crazy.

1062
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:59,830
I hope he let's me
call him "Dad."'

1063
01:21:01,638 --> 01:21:03,913
You okay?
'Cause you look like

1064
01:21:04,098 --> 01:21:06,089
you went somewhere else
there for a second.

1065
01:21:06,267 --> 01:21:09,020
Look, Jason, I need some
fast answers from you

1066
01:21:09,228 --> 01:21:11,947
if I'm ever gonna fix
what I've done.

1067
01:21:12,147 --> 01:21:14,661
I was praying this curse
would have ended with me.

1068
01:21:14,858 --> 01:21:16,337
Yeah, but it didn't.

1069
01:21:16,484 --> 01:21:18,759
So now I need information
to make things right again

1070
01:21:18,944 --> 01:21:20,900
and you're the only one
that can give it to me.

1071
01:21:21,071 --> 01:21:22,220
There is no right.

1072
01:21:22,364 --> 01:21:25,481
You can't change who people are
without destroying who they were.

1073
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:28,089
Who says you can't
make things better?

1074
01:21:28,286 --> 01:21:31,084
You can't play God, son.

1075
01:21:32,539 --> 01:21:34,257
It must end with me.

1076
01:21:34,416 --> 01:21:37,533
Just by being here you may
be killing your mother.

1077
01:21:37,752 --> 01:21:39,788
That's bullshit, you know?

1078
01:21:39,962 --> 01:21:43,034
I'll send you a postcard when
I made everything perfect again.

1079
01:21:44,675 --> 01:21:46,552
Ahh! No, no!

1080
01:22:08,195 --> 01:22:10,186
Just get out, did ya?

1081
01:22:10,363 --> 01:22:12,319
Hmm?

1082
01:22:12,490 --> 01:22:15,687
Oh, nothing, just that my brother
did a stint in the pen

1083
01:22:15,909 --> 01:22:17,581
and he used to eat like that.

1084
01:22:18,745 --> 01:22:21,464
I come from a big family.

1085
01:22:21,664 --> 01:22:23,416
Well, I meant no offence.

1086
01:22:25,167 --> 01:22:26,316
None taken.

1087
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:28,690
Hey, uh...

1088
01:22:28,879 --> 01:22:30,790
Does Kayleigh Miller
still work here?

1089
01:22:32,424 --> 01:22:34,335
I'm sorry.
I never heard of her.

1090
01:22:52,107 --> 01:22:56,180
God! Can't a man get a little
goddamned peace in his own house?!

1091
01:23:00,114 --> 01:23:02,628
I don't suppose
you're here to sell cookies?

1092
01:23:02,824 --> 01:23:04,542
Good guess, fuckbag.

1093
01:23:06,244 --> 01:23:08,155
Remember me, huh?

1094
01:23:08,329 --> 01:23:10,479
We had a nice chat once
when I was seven.

1095
01:23:12,666 --> 01:23:14,702
I got one question for you.

1096
01:23:14,876 --> 01:23:16,707
Where can I find
your daughter?

1097
01:23:50,698 --> 01:23:52,893
Oh, I thought
you were someone else.

1098
01:23:57,663 --> 01:23:59,779
Make it fast,
I'm expecting someone.

1099
01:24:02,167 --> 01:24:05,159
Hey. It's good to see you.

1100
01:24:06,629 --> 01:24:08,142
Can I come in?

1101
01:24:08,297 --> 01:24:10,049
If I knew you were coming,

1102
01:24:10,215 --> 01:24:12,445
I would have cleaned
the stains off the sheets.

1103
01:24:19,556 --> 01:24:21,626
What do you want?

1104
01:24:21,808 --> 01:24:24,197
I just needed to see
a friendly face.

1105
01:24:24,394 --> 01:24:27,113
Well, time is money, Evan.

1106
01:24:29,315 --> 01:24:30,953
Money.

1107
01:24:31,108 --> 01:24:35,465
I guess I can spare 10 minutes
for an old friend, right?

1108
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:38,615
So, how's tricks?

1109
01:24:38,823 --> 01:24:41,018
Sorry, occupational humour.

1110
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:42,758
I got it.

1111
01:24:43,910 --> 01:24:45,980
You can stop now.

1112
01:24:46,162 --> 01:24:48,232
Oh, sorry.

1113
01:24:48,414 --> 01:24:52,043
Does my line of work
make you uncomfortable, precious?

1114
01:24:52,293 --> 01:24:55,842
No, just that you felt like
you had to use it to hurt me.

1115
01:24:59,424 --> 01:25:01,494
I've been where you've been.

1116
01:25:01,676 --> 01:25:03,109
Ha!

1117
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:04,659
Where is that?

1118
01:25:06,346 --> 01:25:09,224
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

1119
01:25:09,432 --> 01:25:11,024
I know people always say that,

1120
01:25:11,184 --> 01:25:12,856
that you wouldn't believe me,

1121
01:25:13,019 --> 01:25:15,214
but in this case
it's not even worth trying, so...

1122
01:25:19,441 --> 01:25:21,671
I knew I needed to find you,

1123
01:25:21,859 --> 01:25:23,611
so I went over to your dad's

1124
01:25:23,778 --> 01:25:25,689
and made him tell me
where you were.

1125
01:25:25,863 --> 01:25:27,854
Then I came here
and the rest you know.

1126
01:25:28,031 --> 01:25:30,067
You're right, Evan,
I don't believe you.

1127
01:25:30,242 --> 01:25:32,517
I never thought you would.

1128
01:25:32,702 --> 01:25:34,932
That's why I never bothered
to tell a soul until now

1129
01:25:35,121 --> 01:25:37,191
and I never will again.

1130
01:25:37,373 --> 01:25:39,204
I'm the only person you've told?

1131
01:25:40,375 --> 01:25:41,888
That's a great line.

1132
01:25:42,043 --> 01:25:44,637
Does that make other girls wet?

1133
01:25:44,837 --> 01:25:47,397
Do they actually
eat up that bullshit?

1134
01:25:50,175 --> 01:25:54,168
You know, I could give a shit
whether you believe me or not.

1135
01:25:54,429 --> 01:25:57,307
Frankly, I'm too tired
to prove it to you...

1136
01:25:57,515 --> 01:25:59,471
Oh, there's proof now, huh?

1137
01:26:01,101 --> 01:26:03,934
How else would I know you have
twin moles on your inner thigh?

1138
01:26:04,145 --> 01:26:06,784
Anyone with 50 bucks
could tell you that.

1139
01:26:06,981 --> 01:26:08,699
Okay.

1140
01:26:08,858 --> 01:26:10,928
Forget that.

1141
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:13,226
How about the fact
that you prefer

1142
01:26:13,403 --> 01:26:15,758
the smell of skunk to flowers?

1143
01:26:15,947 --> 01:26:18,302
Or that you hate cilantro

1144
01:26:18,491 --> 01:26:20,527
because for some reason
unknown to you

1145
01:26:20,701 --> 01:26:22,578
it reminds you
of your stepsister?

1146
01:26:22,745 --> 01:26:26,260
Or that when you have an orgasm,
your toes go numb?

1147
01:26:26,498 --> 01:26:29,217
I'm sure all of your clientele
are privy to that.

1148
01:26:32,503 --> 01:26:35,859
You know? Look, I just
thought you should know.

1149
01:26:36,089 --> 01:26:38,000
Know what?

1150
01:26:38,174 --> 01:26:41,007
That you were happy once...

1151
01:26:42,553 --> 01:26:44,225
with me.

1152
01:26:45,806 --> 01:26:48,240
You know there's one
major hole in your story.

1153
01:26:48,433 --> 01:26:50,867
There's no fucking way
on this planet

1154
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:54,097
or any other, I would ever be
in some fucking sorority!

1155
01:26:58,567 --> 01:27:00,046
You were happy there.

1156
01:27:00,193 --> 01:27:02,024
Oh, you're crying?

1157
01:27:02,195 --> 01:27:04,868
You sure you don't
want your wallet?

1158
01:27:05,072 --> 01:27:06,744
No, I don't need it
where I'm going.

1159
01:27:06,907 --> 01:27:09,944
What, are you off to change
everyone else's life again? Is that it?

1160
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:12,628
Maybe next time you'll pop up
in some mansion

1161
01:27:12,829 --> 01:27:15,297
while I end up in Tijuana
doing some donkey act.

1162
01:27:15,498 --> 01:27:17,932
You know what? I'm over it.

1163
01:27:18,125 --> 01:27:20,355
Every time
I try to help someone

1164
01:27:20,544 --> 01:27:22,023
everything just goes to shit.

1165
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:24,525
Well, don't give up now, slick.

1166
01:27:24,714 --> 01:27:26,909
Hell, you've already
done so much for me.

1167
01:27:27,091 --> 01:27:29,321
Why don't you go back in time

1168
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:32,308
and save Mrs Halpern
and her baby?

1169
01:27:32,512 --> 01:27:37,108
And then maybe Lenny wouldn't
freak out and ruin my family.

1170
01:27:37,391 --> 01:27:39,985
No, go back
to when I was seven

1171
01:27:40,185 --> 01:27:43,655
and fuck me in front
of my daddy's video camera.

1172
01:27:45,148 --> 01:27:47,981
Straighten me out a bit.

1173
01:28:01,704 --> 01:28:03,854
You're on my bed.
Get out!

1174
01:28:04,039 --> 01:28:07,827
Buddy, I thought it would be okay
what with you being sick and all.

1175
01:28:18,134 --> 01:28:20,011
I'm not going to say it again.

1176
01:28:27,851 --> 01:28:30,126
'The last thing I remember
before the blackout

1177
01:28:30,311 --> 01:28:32,381
was holding my hands
over Kayleigh's ears.

1178
01:28:32,563 --> 01:28:35,236
I think I was more focused
on her hands on mine

1179
01:28:35,441 --> 01:28:37,113
than on the mailbox
across the street.'

1180
01:28:44,323 --> 01:28:46,359
Lady, stay back!
Don't go near the mailbox!

1181
01:28:46,534 --> 01:28:49,367
- Idiots!
- I mean it, woman! Get the hell back!

1182
01:28:49,578 --> 01:28:51,773
I'll save you, lady!

1183
01:28:59,878 --> 01:29:02,597
God damn it, I thought
I told you two to get out.

1184
01:29:04,382 --> 01:29:06,213
Oh, sorry, man.
Did we wake you?

1185
01:29:07,885 --> 01:29:10,558
No, it's cool.

1186
01:29:10,763 --> 01:29:12,640
Okay.

1187
01:29:15,266 --> 01:29:16,984
It's really cool.

1188
01:29:38,161 --> 01:29:39,799
What the fuck is this?

1189
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:48,974
- Please save his arm!
- Can you open up my locker?

1190
01:29:49,170 --> 01:29:51,923
- Happy Birthday!
- Can I come too?

1191
01:29:52,131 --> 01:29:53,689
Do you want me
to hold your popcorn?

1192
01:29:55,134 --> 01:29:57,932
Evan? Get a towel!
Get a towel!

1193
01:29:58,136 --> 01:30:00,047
Evan! Oh my God!

1194
01:30:00,221 --> 01:30:02,337
Evan! Evan!
Evan!

1195
01:30:03,808 --> 01:30:05,446
Hey, where you going?

1196
01:30:05,601 --> 01:30:07,910
You ever notice Kayleigh's smile?
I love her smile.

1197
01:30:08,103 --> 01:30:10,014
Lenny's the best.

1198
01:30:10,188 --> 01:30:11,985
You guys make a great couple.

1199
01:30:12,148 --> 01:30:14,059
You ever think
that I'll find someone?

1200
01:30:15,901 --> 01:30:16,970
Evan!

1201
01:30:20,072 --> 01:30:22,506
Where are we going?

1202
01:30:22,699 --> 01:30:24,610
We're taking you
to the hospital, Evan.

1203
01:30:24,784 --> 01:30:27,662
- No, take me back.
- Sorry, your mum would kill me.

1204
01:30:29,830 --> 01:30:31,946
- Oh.
- You take me back, Lenny!

1205
01:30:33,124 --> 01:30:35,718
You owe me that much.

1206
01:30:40,881 --> 01:30:42,394
What are you geeks
looking at?

1207
01:30:42,549 --> 01:30:44,858
It must be nice to be
so goddamed perfect, huh?

1208
01:30:45,051 --> 01:30:48,282
Fucking losers!
Lenny, help me!

1209
01:30:48,512 --> 01:30:50,582
Here, get him over.
Get him over.

1210
01:30:52,141 --> 01:30:55,053
Hey, Brian, how's
your head feeling, buddy?

1211
01:30:55,268 --> 01:30:57,020
I saw that girl
you went home with.

1212
01:30:57,186 --> 01:30:59,177
Did she borrow
your razor this morning?

1213
01:30:59,355 --> 01:31:01,027
You're so bad.

1214
01:31:02,316 --> 01:31:05,308
Hey, there's Tommy.
Hey, Tommy! Tommy!

1215
01:31:05,527 --> 01:31:08,200
Hey, what's up, guys?

1216
01:31:09,489 --> 01:31:11,480
Hey, man,
I did what you said.

1217
01:31:11,657 --> 01:31:14,251
We're pooling our student funds
with the Hillel house

1218
01:31:14,451 --> 01:31:16,442
and we're having
an awareness dance.

1219
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:19,054
Oh, awesome.
Maybe I can spin my chair around

1220
01:31:19,247 --> 01:31:21,363
to a techno remix
of 'Hava Nagila' till I puke.

1221
01:31:23,042 --> 01:31:24,839
Maybe we should be
getting to class now.

1222
01:31:25,002 --> 01:31:26,640
What's the point
of psych class now?

1223
01:31:26,795 --> 01:31:29,468
Tomorrow I could wake up
a dirt farmer in Bangladesh.

1224
01:31:30,965 --> 01:31:32,398
Let's go for a stroll.

1225
01:31:33,634 --> 01:31:34,908
Bye, babe.

1226
01:31:35,052 --> 01:31:36,883
- Yippee.
- Bye, sis.

1227
01:31:37,054 --> 01:31:38,407
What's up with him?

1228
01:31:38,555 --> 01:31:41,274
So Tommy's really
into this Jesus freak thing, huh?

1229
01:31:41,474 --> 01:31:43,430
You know how spiritual
he's gotten

1230
01:31:43,601 --> 01:31:45,876
ever since he saved
Mrs Halpern and Katie.

1231
01:31:47,521 --> 01:31:49,989
He saved Mrs Halpern?

1232
01:31:50,190 --> 01:31:52,181
Please. The twisted fuck.

1233
01:31:53,651 --> 01:31:55,881
Here, why don't we sit right here?

1234
01:32:03,910 --> 01:32:05,423
Want a granola bar?

1235
01:32:08,164 --> 01:32:09,597
Here, just...

1236
01:32:13,877 --> 01:32:16,152
Yeah, I gotta fix
these things or something.

1237
01:32:19,173 --> 01:32:21,084
Kayleigh...

1238
01:32:21,258 --> 01:32:23,010
do you ever think about us?

1239
01:32:23,176 --> 01:32:26,009
I mean, do you ever wonder

1240
01:32:26,221 --> 01:32:28,860
if things might have been
different between us?

1241
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:30,694
Sure, Evan.

1242
01:32:33,310 --> 01:32:35,824
You were the first person
I really ever cared about.

1243
01:32:37,939 --> 01:32:40,248
- I was?
- Yeah.

1244
01:32:41,692 --> 01:32:44,604
That's why when I was little,
I never went to live with my mother.

1245
01:32:45,946 --> 01:32:48,016
I don't get it.

1246
01:32:48,198 --> 01:32:50,314
When... when my folks split up,

1247
01:32:50,491 --> 01:32:53,369
they gave me and Tommy a choice
of who we wanted to live with.

1248
01:32:53,577 --> 01:32:56,171
And I couldn't stand my dad.

1249
01:32:56,371 --> 01:32:59,283
But I knew that if I went
to move with my mum,

1250
01:32:59,499 --> 01:33:01,888
I'd never see you again.

1251
01:33:02,084 --> 01:33:03,756
I didn't know that.

1252
01:33:05,504 --> 01:33:08,541
So you still think about us...

1253
01:33:08,757 --> 01:33:10,429
together?

1254
01:33:12,176 --> 01:33:15,486
Well, it's crossed my mind
from time to time.

1255
01:33:15,721 --> 01:33:17,791
And?

1256
01:33:17,973 --> 01:33:20,567
Well, a lot of things
have crossed my mind, Ev.

1257
01:33:20,767 --> 01:33:24,999
I mean, I could play out the entire movie of
our lives in one second.

1258
01:33:25,271 --> 01:33:27,148
Boom, we fall in love.
We get married.

1259
01:33:27,314 --> 01:33:30,943
We have kids.
Our kids grow old, as do we.

1260
01:33:31,193 --> 01:33:33,627
Matching burial plots.
The whole thing.

1261
01:33:35,238 --> 01:33:38,116
Plah, it took a lot longer
to spit out than to imagine.

1262
01:33:40,284 --> 01:33:42,514
Things like that usually do.

1263
01:33:44,871 --> 01:33:46,543
So...

1264
01:33:46,706 --> 01:33:48,617
do you think that
it might have worked?

1265
01:33:48,791 --> 01:33:50,782
Yeah.

1266
01:33:52,919 --> 01:33:54,955
I mean, but that's
not how things wound up.

1267
01:33:57,507 --> 01:33:59,463
I'm with Lenny.

1268
01:34:00,759 --> 01:34:02,715
Lenny is your friend

1269
01:34:02,886 --> 01:34:05,081
and...

1270
01:34:05,263 --> 01:34:06,901
and that's where it ends.

1271
01:34:09,767 --> 01:34:11,519
Well...

1272
01:34:12,811 --> 01:34:15,644
would it make a difference
if I told you that

1273
01:34:15,856 --> 01:34:19,769
no one could possibly ever
love anyone as much as I love you?

1274
01:34:28,950 --> 01:34:32,306
I'm not saying that. I...

1275
01:34:32,536 --> 01:34:35,892
- Yeah.
- I'm not... I'm just saying it like

1276
01:34:36,123 --> 01:34:39,081
if you were a girl,
would that be something

1277
01:34:39,292 --> 01:34:41,044
that you would want to hear?

1278
01:34:44,922 --> 01:34:46,799
Hold on one second.
Lenny's calling.

1279
01:34:46,965 --> 01:34:48,842
I'll be right back, Ev, okay?

1280
01:34:55,097 --> 01:34:56,974
He's a little down...

1281
01:34:58,142 --> 01:34:59,814
I love you.

1282
01:35:56,399 --> 01:35:58,230
You forgot to put
the toaster on the ledge.

1283
01:35:59,819 --> 01:36:02,891
Lenny likes Pop Tarts.

1284
01:36:03,114 --> 01:36:05,230
You guys are all
that matter now.

1285
01:36:07,742 --> 01:36:10,336
Man, I know it's hard,
but you can't give up.

1286
01:36:10,536 --> 01:36:13,334
I can't even
fucking kill myself.

1287
01:36:13,539 --> 01:36:15,291
Don't talk like that.

1288
01:36:25,007 --> 01:36:27,202
Alright, I've got
to get you out of here.

1289
01:36:27,384 --> 01:36:29,579
Visiting hours
are almost over.

1290
01:36:33,890 --> 01:36:36,165
Did Mum
get transferred again?

1291
01:36:36,350 --> 01:36:39,262
What are you talking about?
She's been here the entire time.

1292
01:36:46,901 --> 01:36:50,496
Looking... good, kiddo.

1293
01:36:55,877 --> 01:36:58,516
Lung cancer?

1294
01:36:58,713 --> 01:37:01,830
You started chain smoking
when I blew myself up.

1295
01:37:02,049 --> 01:37:04,444
Sorry, Mrs T, he's been
acting out of sorts lately.

1296
01:37:04,546 --> 01:37:06,343
Mum...

1297
01:37:06,506 --> 01:37:08,224
you're going to be okay.

1298
01:37:08,383 --> 01:37:10,021
I can change it.

1299
01:37:10,176 --> 01:37:12,371
Um, maybe... I wanna go
down to the chapel.

1300
01:37:13,554 --> 01:37:18,105
You're... acting...

1301
01:37:18,391 --> 01:37:21,667
just like your father.

1302
01:37:21,102 --> 01:37:23,821
I'm going to get you
out of here. Okay?

1303
01:37:24,021 --> 01:37:24,897
No.

1304
01:37:25,856 --> 01:37:27,448
You're not going
to hurt anymore.

1305
01:37:27,607 --> 01:37:29,484
I'm going to fix it.

1306
01:37:29,651 --> 01:37:30,640
No.

1307
01:37:32,195 --> 01:37:34,186
No, no.

1308
01:37:37,407 --> 01:37:38,806
Are you sure
you even packed it?

1309
01:37:38,950 --> 01:37:40,622
My mum packed it.

1310
01:37:40,785 --> 01:37:42,776
I think she sent
everything I ever owned.

1311
01:37:42,954 --> 01:37:44,990
- Is this it?
- Yeah.

1312
01:37:45,164 --> 01:37:47,155
What do you want it for?
I don't get you lately.

1313
01:37:47,332 --> 01:37:48,845
Duly noted.

1314
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:53,800
Okay, I have to ask you
one last favour.

1315
01:37:53,963 --> 01:37:55,919
- What?
- I need you to be quiet.

1316
01:37:56,090 --> 01:37:58,843
I have to concentrate
if I wanna destroy the blockbuster.

1317
01:37:59,051 --> 01:38:02,839
- What? What, the blockbuster?
- If I hadn't blown off my arms,

1318
01:38:03,096 --> 01:38:05,974
my mum would've never started
smoking in the first place.

1319
01:38:06,182 --> 01:38:08,013
Never mind. Just open it.

1320
01:38:10,227 --> 01:38:11,819
Turn it.

1321
01:38:11,978 --> 01:38:14,208
There.

1322
01:38:18,067 --> 01:38:20,058
'Today Mummy
is taking me to play

1323
01:38:20,235 --> 01:38:21,987
with Kayleigh and Tommy.

1324
01:38:22,154 --> 01:38:25,351
I will meet their father
and see what a real dad is like.'

1325
01:38:28,618 --> 01:38:30,893
Now, how do I destroy
the blockbuster?

1326
01:38:46,216 --> 01:38:49,606
Evan, what are you
doing with that knife?

1327
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:57,173
Well, that didn't work.
Go on, turn it.

1328
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,073
Turn it. There.

1329
01:39:01,771 --> 01:39:04,285
'I never wanted
to be in the movie anyway.

1330
01:39:04,481 --> 01:39:06,836
It was cold so I wanted
to wear my clothes.

1331
01:39:07,025 --> 01:39:08,936
But Mr Miller made me
take my shirt off.'

1332
01:39:09,110 --> 01:39:10,782
In this part of the story,

1333
01:39:10,945 --> 01:39:14,415
Robin Hood has just
married Maid Marian.

1334
01:39:14,657 --> 01:39:17,967
And they have
to kiss and stuff,

1335
01:39:18,201 --> 01:39:19,714
like grown-ups do.

1336
01:39:19,869 --> 01:39:21,700
Wait, I need my belt.

1337
01:39:28,794 --> 01:39:31,467
Hey, don't even
bother about a belt.

1338
01:39:31,671 --> 01:39:35,107
- Hey.
- Back off, fuckbag.

1339
01:39:35,341 --> 01:39:38,253
Amazing that word never fails
to make an impression with you.

1340
01:39:38,469 --> 01:39:40,858
Easy does it, Evan.

1341
01:39:41,054 --> 01:39:43,932
Don't be a bad boy
or I'll tell your mother

1342
01:39:44,140 --> 01:39:46,017
what a naughty
little shit you are.

1343
01:39:46,184 --> 01:39:48,061
And I'll tell
Child Protective Services

1344
01:39:48,227 --> 01:39:50,343
about your little
kiddie porn endeavours.

1345
01:39:50,521 --> 01:39:52,637
One step closer
and I'll shove this up your arse.

1346
01:39:52,814 --> 01:39:55,044
Hey, that's dangerous.
You could blow off your hand.

1347
01:39:55,233 --> 01:39:57,269
Been there, done that.

1348
01:39:59,862 --> 01:40:00,977
Hey!

1349
01:40:05,033 --> 01:40:06,910
- Sparkler.
- Kayleigh, no!

1350
01:40:07,076 --> 01:40:09,636
No! Kayleigh, no!

1351
01:40:17,585 --> 01:40:18,813
Hey, man.

1352
01:40:20,546 --> 01:40:22,264
...good, kiddo.

1353
01:40:22,423 --> 01:40:25,176
I've got no choice but to commit you
to Sunnyvale Institution...

1354
01:40:25,384 --> 01:40:27,739
You're gonna have to live
somewhere else for a while.

1355
01:40:27,927 --> 01:40:29,918
- A squashed butterfly.
- I want my mummy!

1356
01:40:30,096 --> 01:40:31,415
I'm so sick of this!

1357
01:40:31,556 --> 01:40:33,467
I think we should
up your medication.

1358
01:41:03,041 --> 01:41:04,793
Where are
my goddamn books?

1359
01:41:04,959 --> 01:41:07,917
Hey, Evan, we're not supposed
to meet for another hour.

1360
01:41:08,128 --> 01:41:10,358
Where are
my goddamn books?

1361
01:41:10,547 --> 01:41:12,981
Books?

1362
01:41:13,174 --> 01:41:15,051
My journals.

1363
01:41:15,218 --> 01:41:17,095
L... I need them.

1364
01:41:17,261 --> 01:41:21,049
So, if you'd give 'em to me,
it'd help a lot.

1365
01:41:21,306 --> 01:41:23,376
It really hurts me
to go through this again.

1366
01:41:24,642 --> 01:41:26,473
There are no journals.

1367
01:41:26,644 --> 01:41:28,600
There never were.

1368
01:41:28,771 --> 01:41:31,444
It's part of the fantasy world
that your mind created

1369
01:41:31,648 --> 01:41:34,879
to cope with the guilt
of killing Kayleigh Miller.

1370
01:41:35,110 --> 01:41:37,988
Think, Evan, think.

1371
01:41:38,196 --> 01:41:40,585
You've created a disease
that does not exist...

1372
01:41:41,824 --> 01:41:43,815
alternate universes with colleges

1373
01:41:43,992 --> 01:41:46,267
and prisons and paraplegia.

1374
01:41:46,453 --> 01:41:49,286
I want my journals
and I want 'em now!

1375
01:41:49,497 --> 01:41:52,295
And I know that you got 'em
and you're gonna give 'em to me!

1376
01:41:52,499 --> 01:41:54,774
You're not going to hide them
from me. I want them!

1377
01:41:56,836 --> 01:41:59,225
You're reminding me
of your father.

1378
01:41:59,422 --> 01:42:01,572
He was always screaming
for a photo album

1379
01:42:01,757 --> 01:42:03,668
even though
he never had one.

1380
01:42:05,344 --> 01:42:06,982
I'm so sorry.

1381
01:42:10,848 --> 01:42:12,998
A photo album?

1382
01:42:13,184 --> 01:42:15,778
- Photos.
- Evan?

1383
01:42:18,021 --> 01:42:21,218
The damage is irreparable.

1384
01:42:26,695 --> 01:42:29,892
Frankly, I'm surprised he still
has use of his motor functions.

1385
01:42:40,165 --> 01:42:42,440
Mum?

1386
01:42:42,625 --> 01:42:45,662
Um, did you remember to bring

1387
01:42:45,878 --> 01:42:47,948
those home movies
that we used to make?

1388
01:42:49,131 --> 01:42:50,928
Yeah, they're right here.

1389
01:42:52,509 --> 01:42:56,422
Good, because I really like
to watch them.

1390
01:43:00,432 --> 01:43:01,945
So that's good.

1391
01:43:06,729 --> 01:43:09,197
I think it's best we
transfer him to Bellevue

1392
01:43:09,398 --> 01:43:10,831
first thing in the morning.

1393
01:43:53,436 --> 01:43:56,348
'If anyone finds this,

1394
01:43:56,563 --> 01:44:01,000
it means that my plan
didn't work

1395
01:44:01,276 --> 01:44:03,585
and I'm already dead.'

1396
01:44:05,321 --> 01:44:08,119
He's not in his room.
Search the grounds.

1397
01:44:08,323 --> 01:44:11,440
'If I can somehow go back

1398
01:44:11,660 --> 01:44:13,969
to the beginning
of all of this

1399
01:44:14,162 --> 01:44:18,633
I might be able to save her.'

1400
01:44:19,932 --> 01:44:21,332
Evan!

1401
01:44:22,935 --> 01:44:24,055
Over here!

1402
01:44:24,102 --> 01:44:25,502
Evan!

1403
01:44:26,062 --> 01:44:27,462
I believe he's in here.

1404
01:44:28,356 --> 01:44:29,556
Evan!

1405
01:44:32,318 --> 01:44:33,118
What's your name?

1406
01:44:33,152 --> 01:44:34,152
Kayleigh.

1407
01:44:34,319 --> 01:44:35,719
This is Evan.

1408
01:44:36,696 --> 01:44:38,496
Evan! Open up!

1409
01:44:39,532 --> 01:44:40,732
Evan!

1410
01:44:43,702 --> 01:44:46,102
Say hi, go on.

1411
01:45:00,175 --> 01:45:04,175
I hate you. You ever come near me again
I'll kill you and

1412
01:45:04,345 --> 01:45:06,345
..your whole damned family.

1413
01:45:11,935 --> 01:45:15,135
What happened sweetie? What's wrong?

1414
01:45:16,313 --> 01:45:17,913
Goodbye

1415
01:45:24,153 --> 01:45:25,153
Cracker!

1416
01:45:25,196 --> 01:45:26,196
Evan...

1417
01:45:30,206 --> 01:45:32,281
Kayleigh and Tommy!

1418
01:45:32,457 --> 01:45:34,732
I missed you!

1419
01:45:34,918 --> 01:45:37,876
I'll never let you guys
out of my sight again.

1420
01:45:39,317 --> 01:45:41,751
Happiness can only
be achieved through sacrifice,

1421
01:45:41,945 --> 01:45:44,015
like the sacrifices our parents have made
for us to be here today...

1422
01:45:44,197 --> 01:45:46,631
Whoo-hoo! Great! Tommy!

1423
01:45:51,969 --> 01:45:53,769
Are you alright?

1424
01:45:55,722 --> 01:45:56,922
Where's Kayleigh?

1425
01:45:56,973 --> 01:45:58,893
Who's Kayleigh?

1426
01:46:00,226 --> 01:46:02,026
Who's Kayleigh?

1427
01:46:05,522 --> 01:46:07,322
Who's Kayleigh?

1428
01:46:07,607 --> 01:46:09,607
Do you want me to take you to the doctor?

1429
01:46:09,817 --> 01:46:11,017
No.

1430
01:46:18,575 --> 01:46:22,375
No. I think everything
is going to be alright this time.

1431
01:46:38,175 --> 01:46:40,175
Sure about this?

1432
01:46:42,428 --> 01:46:46,428
I know who I am, I don't need
a bunch of stuff to remind me.

1433
01:47:09,243 --> 01:47:11,043
I'm running a little late.

1434
01:47:10,994 --> 01:47:13,394
Yeah, I had to finish up with a patient.

1435
01:47:15,582 --> 01:47:16,982
Get the soup or something.

1436
01:47:18,209 --> 01:47:19,609
Alright, love you Mom.

1437
01:47:20,294 --> 01:47:21,494
Bye bye.
