1
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,586
According to all known laws
of aviation,

2
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,390
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

3
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:35,162
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

4
00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:37,668
The bee, of course, flies anyway

5
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:41,901
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

6
00:00:58,924 --> 00:01:02,360
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

7
00:01:02,428 --> 00:01:05,556
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

8
00:01:16,308 --> 00:01:19,277
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

9
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:20,676
Ooming!

10
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,341
Hang on a second.

11
00:01:24,383 --> 00:01:25,372
Hello?

12
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:26,543
- Barry?
- Adam?

13
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:30,180
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

14
00:01:33,192 --> 00:01:34,523
Looking sharp.

15
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:41,294
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

16
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,732
Sorry. I'm excited.

17
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:45,794
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

18
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:48,305
A perfect report card, all B's.

19
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:49,636
Very proud.

20
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,573
Ma! I got a thing going here.

21
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:54,306
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

22
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,816
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

23
00:01:57,883 --> 00:02:00,443
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

24
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,171
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

25
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:27,644
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

26
00:02:27,713 --> 00:02:29,112
Never thought I'd make it.

27
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:31,672
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

28
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,944
Those were awkward.

29
00:02:33,018 --> 00:02:37,182
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

30
00:02:37,256 --> 00:02:39,019
You did come back different.

31
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:42,755
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

32
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,459
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

33
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:48,398
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

34
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:50,662
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

35
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:53,330
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

36
00:02:53,405 --> 00:02:55,930
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

37
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:07,078
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

38
00:03:07,152 --> 00:03:09,416
That's why we don't need vacations.

39
00:03:15,227 --> 00:03:19,391
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

40
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:25,332
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

41
00:03:25,404 --> 00:03:26,837
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

42
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,237
Hallelujah!

43
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:32,173
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

44
00:03:32,244 --> 00:03:35,236
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

45
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:40,543
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

46
00:03:41,253 --> 00:03:42,914
...9:15.

47
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,883
That concludes our ceremonies.

48
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:51,793
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

49
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,422
Will we pick ourjob today?

50
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,364
I heard it's just orientation.

51
00:03:55,434 --> 00:03:57,425
Heads up! Here we go.

52
00:03:58,837 --> 00:04:02,273
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

53
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:14,108
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

54
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,718
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

55
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,624
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

56
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,127
This is it!

57
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:26,691
Wow.

58
00:04:31,737 --> 00:04:32,897
Wow.

59
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:35,907
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

60
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:40,275
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

61
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:44,976
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

62
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,813
Our top-secret formula

63
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:51,083
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

64
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:53,750
into this soothing sweet syrup

65
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:57,762
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

66
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,991
Honey!

67
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:04,768
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

68
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:07,032
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

69
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:10,837
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

70
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:14,037
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

71
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:17,708
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

72
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:36,290
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

73
00:05:36,368 --> 00:05:39,895
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

74
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:43,203
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

75
00:05:43,275 --> 00:05:46,472
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

76
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,039
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

77
00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:55,143
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

78
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,951
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

79
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:00,924
But choose carefully

80
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:05,692
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

81
00:06:06,698 --> 00:06:09,826
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

82
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:11,631
What's the difference?

83
00:06:12,604 --> 00:06:17,064
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

84
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:19,633
in 27 million years.

85
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,413
So you'll just work us to death?

86
00:06:22,481 --> 00:06:23,709
We'll sure try.

87
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:44,659
Wow! That blew my mind!

88
00:06:46,004 --> 00:06:48,529
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?

89
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:51,940
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

90
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,343
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

91
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:58,440
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

92
00:06:58,517 --> 00:07:01,008
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

93
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:04,078
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

94
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:09,686
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

95
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:11,752
Like what? Give me one example.

96
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,962
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

97
00:07:21,373 --> 00:07:24,467
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

98
00:07:24,543 --> 00:07:26,408
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

99
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:28,776
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

100
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:42,484
I've never seen them this close.

101
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:44,893
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

102
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:46,726
Yeah, but some don't come back.

103
00:07:46,798 --> 00:07:48,390
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

104
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:13,516
You guys did great!

105
00:08:13,592 --> 00:08:18,029
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

106
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:20,530
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

107
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:22,032
Their day's not planned.

108
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,627
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

109
00:08:25,704 --> 00:08:29,697
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

110
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:31,439
Right.

111
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:36,312
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

112
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:39,873
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

113
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:45,652
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

114
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:48,386
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

115
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,121
Distant. Distant.

116
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:52,527
Look at these two.

117
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:55,567
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

118
00:08:55,634 --> 00:08:57,966
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

119
00:08:58,036 --> 00:09:01,062
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

120
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:04,768
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

121
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:07,334
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

122
00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:09,346
What were you doing during this?

123
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:11,143
Trying to alert the authorities.

124
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:12,911
I can autograph that.

125
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,920
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

126
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,250
Yeah. Gusty.

127
00:09:17,322 --> 00:09:20,780
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

128
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:22,383
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

129
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:25,897
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

130
00:09:25,964 --> 00:09:27,898
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

131
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:30,560
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

132
00:09:32,137 --> 00:09:35,231
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

133
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,704
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

134
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:50,485
Hey, Honex!

135
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:52,819
Dad, you surprised me.

136
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:55,155
You decide what you're interested in?

137
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:58,390
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

138
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,827
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

139
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,891
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

140
00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:07,837
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

141
00:10:07,906 --> 00:10:11,273
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

142
00:10:11,343 --> 00:10:13,675
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

143
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:17,146
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

144
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,979
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

145
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,452
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

146
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:25,752
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

147
00:10:25,824 --> 00:10:29,817
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

148
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:33,387
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

149
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:36,366
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

150
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:38,164
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

151
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:41,330
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

152
00:10:41,406 --> 00:10:43,431
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

153
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:46,602
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

154
00:10:46,678 --> 00:10:51,047
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!

155
00:10:51,116 --> 00:10:52,515
I'm so proud.

156
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:02,285
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

157
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,522
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

158
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:05,961
Yeah, right.

159
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:10,832
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

160
00:11:10,902 --> 00:11:13,996
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!

161
00:11:14,072 --> 00:11:16,973
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.

162
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:20,134
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!

163
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:21,372
Wow!

164
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:22,811
Oouple of newbies?

165
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:25,315
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

166
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:26,612
Make your choice.

167
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,984
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

168
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:32,819
Oh, my. What's available?

169
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:35,860
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

170
00:11:35,927 --> 00:11:39,863
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

171
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,360
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

172
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:44,959
Wax monkey's always open.

173
00:11:45,837 --> 00:11:48,101
The Krelman opened up again.

174
00:11:48,173 --> 00:11:49,162
What happened?

175
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:52,836
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

176
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:54,742
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

177
00:11:54,813 --> 00:11:58,180
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

178
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,411
Oh, this is so hard!

179
00:12:01,286 --> 00:12:03,754
Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,

180
00:12:03,822 --> 00:12:08,054
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,

181
00:12:08,126 --> 00:12:11,527
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?

182
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,261
Barry!

183
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:17,899
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...

184
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:19,800
What happened to you?
Where are you?

185
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:22,237
- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?

186
00:12:22,307 --> 00:12:23,899
- Out there.
- Oh, no!

187
00:12:23,975 --> 00:12:26,671
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.

188
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:29,236
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?

189
00:12:29,314 --> 00:12:30,975
Another call coming in.

190
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,746
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd

191
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,255
that gets their roses today.

192
00:12:38,323 --> 00:12:39,483
Hey, guys.

193
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:42,755
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

194
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,092
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

195
00:12:45,163 --> 00:12:47,256
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.

196
00:12:47,332 --> 00:12:49,232
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

197
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,770
Sign here, here. Just initial that.

198
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,362
- Thank you.
- OK.

199
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:56,270
You got a rain advisory today,

200
00:12:56,341 --> 00:13:00,402
and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.

201
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,107
So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,

202
00:13:03,348 --> 00:13:06,840
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.

203
00:13:06,918 --> 00:13:10,786
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.

204
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:15,520
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!

205
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:18,558
- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,

206
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:22,623
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!

207
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,862
All right, launch positions!

208
00:13:26,037 --> 00:13:30,872
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

209
00:13:32,043 --> 00:13:33,635
Black and yellow!

210
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:34,872
Hello!

211
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:38,181
You ready for this, hot shot?

212
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,081
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

213
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:41,641
Wind, check.

214
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,745
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.

215
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:46,313
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.

216
00:13:46,391 --> 00:13:48,359
Scared out of my shorts, check.

217
00:13:48,426 --> 00:13:50,485
OK, ladies,

218
00:13:50,562 --> 00:13:52,393
let's move it out!

219
00:14:01,406 --> 00:14:05,740
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!

220
00:14:06,077 --> 00:14:10,343
All of you, drain those flowers!

221
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:29,099
Wow! I'm out!

222
00:14:29,601 --> 00:14:31,762
I can't believe I'm out!

223
00:14:33,438 --> 00:14:35,099
So blue.

224
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,612
I feel so fast and free!

225
00:14:46,117 --> 00:14:47,448
Box kite!

226
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,112
Wow!

227
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,461
Flowers!

228
00:15:12,644 --> 00:15:15,010
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.

229
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,105
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.

230
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,206
Roses!

231
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:21,081
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.

232
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:35,261
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.

233
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,269
That is one nectar collector!

234
00:15:45,243 --> 00:15:47,473
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.

235
00:15:47,712 --> 00:15:52,342
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,

236
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:55,716
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.

237
00:15:55,987 --> 00:15:58,512
That's amazing. Why do we do that?

238
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:03,425
That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

239
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:04,621
Oool.

240
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:29,946
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?

241
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:32,283
Oopy that visual.

242
00:16:32,357 --> 00:16:35,019
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.

243
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:37,618
Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?

244
00:16:37,862 --> 00:16:39,193
Affirmative.

245
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,306
That was on the line!

246
00:16:51,376 --> 00:16:53,970
This is the coolest. What is it?

247
00:16:54,045 --> 00:16:56,639
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.

248
00:16:56,715 --> 00:17:00,811
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.

249
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:02,477
Yeah, fuzzy.

250
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,317
Ohemical-y.

251
00:17:04,389 --> 00:17:06,550
Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.

252
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,819
My sweet lord of bees!

253
00:17:09,894 --> 00:17:11,885
Oandy-brain, get off there!

254
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,720
Problem!

255
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,402
- Guys!
- This could be bad.

256
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,664
Affirmative.

257
00:17:20,238 --> 00:17:21,569
Very close.

258
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:23,905
Gonna hurt.

259
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:26,270
Mama's little boy.

260
00:17:26,344 --> 00:17:28,244
You are way out of position, rookie!

261
00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:33,581
Ooming in at you like a missile!

262
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:39,151
Help me!

263
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,423
I don't think these are flowers.

264
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:45,019
- Should we tell him?
- I think he knows.

265
00:17:45,096 --> 00:17:46,427
What is this?!

266
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:52,534
Match point!

267
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:57,598
You can start packing up, honey,
because you're about to eat it!

268
00:18:06,284 --> 00:18:07,615
Yowser!

269
00:18:36,247 --> 00:18:37,441
Gross.

270
00:18:43,254 --> 00:18:45,154
There's a bee in the car!

271
00:18:47,091 --> 00:18:48,718
- Do something!
- I'm driving!

272
00:18:48,793 --> 00:18:50,624
- Hi, bee.
- He's back here!

273
00:18:50,695 --> 00:18:52,424
He's going to sting me!

274
00:19:00,338 --> 00:19:04,934
Nobody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!

275
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,443
He blinked!

276
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:08,536
Spray him, Granny!

277
00:19:08,613 --> 00:19:10,103
What are you doing?!

278
00:19:18,189 --> 00:19:21,852
Wow... the tension level
out here is unbelievable.

279
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,184
I gotta get home.

280
00:19:33,938 --> 00:19:35,462
Oan't fly in rain.

281
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,565
Oan't fly in rain.

282
00:19:37,642 --> 00:19:38,631
Oan't fly in rain.

283
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,711
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!

284
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:53,892
Ken, could you close
the window please?

285
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:56,326
Ken, could you close
the window please?

286
00:19:56,394 --> 00:20:00,057
Oheck out my new resume.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.

287
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:01,928
You see? Folds out.

288
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,400
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

289
00:20:07,238 --> 00:20:09,069
What was that?

290
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,735
Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...

291
00:20:13,077 --> 00:20:14,772
Drapes!

292
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:16,837
That is diabolical.

293
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:21,852
It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.

294
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,785
What's number one? Star Wars?

295
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,322
Nah, I don't go for that...

296
00:20:27,258 --> 00:20:28,589
...kind of stuff.

297
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,595
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.

298
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:35,895
When I leave a job interview, they're
flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.

299
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:39,095
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.

300
00:20:39,604 --> 00:20:42,664
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.

301
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,875
I predicted global warming.

302
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:54,782
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.

303
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:58,115
Wait! Stop! Bee!

304
00:21:00,124 --> 00:21:03,025
Stand back. These are winter boots.

305
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:06,886
Wait!

306
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:08,492
Don't kill him!

307
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:11,626
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!

308
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:14,467
Why does his life have
less value than yours?

309
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:20,070
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?

310
00:21:20,144 --> 00:21:25,138
I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capable of feeling.

311
00:21:27,151 --> 00:21:28,641
My brochure!

312
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:44,828
There you go, little guy.

313
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,738
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.

314
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:54,277
Put that on your resume brochure.

315
00:21:54,345 --> 00:21:56,279
My whole face could puff up.

316
00:21:56,347 --> 00:21:58,338
Make it one of your special skills.

317
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:01,749
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.

318
00:22:04,522 --> 00:22:06,456
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

319
00:22:06,524 --> 00:22:10,119
- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

320
00:22:10,194 --> 00:22:12,355
- You could put carob chips on there.
- Bye.

321
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,694
- Supposed to be less calories.
- Bye.

322
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:22,663
I gotta say something.

323
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:26,432
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.

324
00:22:27,712 --> 00:22:29,441
All right, here it goes.

325
00:22:41,392 --> 00:22:42,552
Nah.

326
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:50,898
What would I say?

327
00:22:53,571 --> 00:22:55,732
I could really get in trouble.

328
00:22:57,675 --> 00:23:01,008
It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.

329
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,910
I can't believe I'm doing this.

330
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:05,071
I've got to.

331
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:07,413
Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!

332
00:23:08,586 --> 00:23:10,349
No. Yes. No.

333
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:12,412
Do it. I can't.

334
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:16,985
How should I start it?
"You like jazz?" No, that's no good.

335
00:23:17,061 --> 00:23:20,189
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

336
00:23:20,264 --> 00:23:22,027
Hi!

337
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,692
I'm sorry.

338
00:23:23,768 --> 00:23:26,202
- You're talking.
- Yes, I know.

339
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,532
You're talking!

340
00:23:27,605 --> 00:23:28,936
I'm so sorry.

341
00:23:29,006 --> 00:23:32,203
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.

342
00:23:32,276 --> 00:23:34,403
But I don't recall going to bed.

343
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:37,573
Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.

344
00:23:37,648 --> 00:23:42,449
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!

345
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,081
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,

346
00:23:46,157 --> 00:23:48,216
but they were all trying to kill me.

347
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:50,624
And if it wasn't for you...

348
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,095
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.

349
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:57,361
That was a little weird.

350
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:59,426
- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.

351
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:03,270
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!

352
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:06,139
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.

353
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:09,543
- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?

354
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,082
The talking thing.

355
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:16,416
Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.

356
00:24:16,487 --> 00:24:17,920
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.

357
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:22,289
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

358
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,418
Anyway...

359
00:24:23,494 --> 00:24:24,791
Oan I...

360
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:27,294
...get you something?
- Like what?

361
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:31,768
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Ooffee?

362
00:24:31,836 --> 00:24:34,168
I don't want to put you out.

363
00:24:34,238 --> 00:24:36,502
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

364
00:24:36,574 --> 00:24:38,633
- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.

365
00:24:38,709 --> 00:24:41,769
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.

366
00:24:41,846 --> 00:24:43,143
Hey, you want rum cake?

367
00:24:43,214 --> 00:24:44,647
- I shouldn't.
- Have some.

368
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:46,979
- No, I can't.
- Oome on!

369
00:24:47,051 --> 00:24:49,246
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

370
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,151
- Where?
- These stripes don't help.

371
00:24:51,222 --> 00:24:52,314
You look great!

372
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,086
I don't know if you know
anything about fashion.

373
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:56,382
Are you all right?

374
00:24:56,894 --> 00:24:58,225
No.

375
00:24:59,897 --> 00:25:04,095
He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.

376
00:25:04,168 --> 00:25:06,102
He finally gets there.

377
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:09,833
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.

378
00:25:09,907 --> 00:25:14,003
And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.

379
00:25:14,078 --> 00:25:16,308
Why would I marry a watermelon?"

380
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,717
Is that a bee joke?

381
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:26,313
That's the kind of stuff we do.

382
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,358
Yeah, different.

383
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:31,452
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?

384
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:33,520
About work? I don't know.

385
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:38,058
I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.

386
00:25:38,135 --> 00:25:39,466
I know how you feel.

387
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:41,471
- You do?
- Sure.

388
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:45,999
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.

389
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,875
- Really?
- My only interest is flowers.

390
00:25:48,946 --> 00:25:52,609
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.

391
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:56,213
Anyway, if you look...

392
00:25:56,287 --> 00:25:59,051
There's my hive right there. See it?

393
00:25:59,123 --> 00:26:00,818
You're in Sheep Meadow!

394
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:03,553
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!

395
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:08,395
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.

396
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:11,299
- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
- Why not?

397
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:14,827
- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
- Maybe I'll try that.

398
00:26:14,905 --> 00:26:18,636
- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

399
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:20,939
Just having two cups of coffee!

400
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:36,817
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.

401
00:26:36,894 --> 00:26:38,088
Yeah, it's no trouble.

402
00:26:38,162 --> 00:26:41,996
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
I'd be up the rest of my life.

403
00:26:42,466 --> 00:26:43,660
Are you...?

404
00:26:44,468 --> 00:26:47,369
Oan I take a piece of this with me?

405
00:26:47,438 --> 00:26:50,464
Sure! Here, have a crumb.

406
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:53,872
- Thanks!
- Yeah.

407
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:58,244
All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.

408
00:26:58,316 --> 00:26:59,806
Or not.

409
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:01,778
OK, Barry.

410
00:27:01,852 --> 00:27:04,844
And thank you
so much again... for before.

411
00:27:04,922 --> 00:27:06,890
Oh, that? That was nothing.

412
00:27:06,957 --> 00:27:09,687
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...

413
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:32,746
This can't possibly work.

414
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,411
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.

415
00:27:35,486 --> 00:27:37,750
OK, Dave, pull the chute.

416
00:27:41,158 --> 00:27:43,023
- Sounds amazing.
- It was amazing!

417
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:46,029
It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.

418
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:48,691
Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!

419
00:27:48,766 --> 00:27:51,360
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?

420
00:27:51,435 --> 00:27:53,596
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.

421
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:56,435
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.

422
00:27:56,507 --> 00:28:00,341
- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. But some of them don't.

423
00:28:00,411 --> 00:28:01,969
- How'd you get back?
- Poodle.

424
00:28:02,046 --> 00:28:06,210
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.

425
00:28:06,283 --> 00:28:10,720
You had your "experience." Now you
can pick out yourjob and be normal.

426
00:28:10,788 --> 00:28:12,449
- Well...
- Well?

427
00:28:12,523 --> 00:28:13,820
Well, I met someone.

428
00:28:13,891 --> 00:28:16,223
You did? Was she Bee-ish?

429
00:28:16,293 --> 00:28:19,558
- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
- No, no, no, not a wasp.

430
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,962
- Spider?
- I'm not attracted to spiders.

431
00:28:22,032 --> 00:28:25,229
I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.

432
00:28:25,302 --> 00:28:26,633
I can't get by that face.

433
00:28:27,304 --> 00:28:29,329
So who is she?

434
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:32,467
She's... human.

435
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:36,411
No, no. That's a bee law.
You wouldn't break a bee law.

436
00:28:36,647 --> 00:28:38,581
- Her name's Vanessa.
- Oh, boy.

437
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:41,584
She's so nice. And she's a florist!

438
00:28:41,652 --> 00:28:44,416
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!

439
00:28:44,655 --> 00:28:46,020
We're not dating.

440
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:50,151
You're flying outside the hive, talking
to humans that attack our homes

441
00:28:50,227 --> 00:28:53,856
with power washers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!

442
00:28:53,931 --> 00:28:57,924
She saved my life!
And she understands me.

443
00:28:58,002 --> 00:28:59,162
This is over!

444
00:28:59,236 --> 00:29:00,726
Eat this.

445
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:03,501
This is not over! What was that?

446
00:29:03,574 --> 00:29:06,042
- They call it a crumb.
- It was so stingin' stripey!

447
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:09,602
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!

448
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,614
- You know what a Oinnabon is?
- No.

449
00:29:11,682 --> 00:29:15,049
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...

450
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:16,177
Sit down!

451
00:29:16,253 --> 00:29:18,187
...really hot!
- Listen to me!

452
00:29:18,255 --> 00:29:22,282
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!

453
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:25,624
Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?

454
00:29:25,696 --> 00:29:28,460
There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!

455
00:29:28,532 --> 00:29:32,798
You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!

456
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,633
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

457
00:29:34,705 --> 00:29:39,074
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

458
00:29:40,611 --> 00:29:42,806
There he is. He's in the pool.

459
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,280
You know what your problem is, Barry?

460
00:29:45,349 --> 00:29:47,374
I gotta start thinking bee?

461
00:29:47,451 --> 00:29:49,385
How much longer will this go on?

462
00:29:49,453 --> 00:29:52,445
It's been three days!
Why aren't you working?

463
00:29:52,523 --> 00:29:55,287
I've got a lot of big life decisions
to think about.

464
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:59,591
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!

465
00:29:59,663 --> 00:30:02,097
Would it kill you
to make a little honey?

466
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:05,033
Barry, come out.
Your father's talking to you.

467
00:30:05,102 --> 00:30:06,967
Martin, would you talk to him?

468
00:30:07,037 --> 00:30:08,732
Barry, I'm talking to you!

469
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:38,526
You coming?

470
00:30:38,602 --> 00:30:40,433
Got everything?

471
00:30:40,771 --> 00:30:42,602
All set!

472
00:30:42,673 --> 00:30:44,004
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

473
00:30:44,074 --> 00:30:45,666
Don't be too long.

474
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,452
Watch this!

475
00:31:13,804 --> 00:31:15,465
Vanessa!

476
00:31:18,275 --> 00:31:21,073
- We're still here.
- I told you not to yell at him.

477
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:23,238
He doesn't respond to yelling!

478
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:25,475
- Then why yell at me?
- Because you don't listen!

479
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:27,176
I'm not listening to this.

480
00:31:27,251 --> 00:31:28,411
Sorry, I've gotta go.

481
00:31:28,485 --> 00:31:30,919
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting a friend.

482
00:31:30,988 --> 00:31:33,718
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?

483
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:34,883
Bye.

484
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,223
I just hope she's Bee-ish.

485
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,666
They have a huge parade
of flowers every year in Pasadena?

486
00:31:44,735 --> 00:31:49,263
To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!

487
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,777
Up on a float, surrounded
by flowers, crowds cheering.

488
00:31:53,844 --> 00:31:57,245
A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?

489
00:31:57,681 --> 00:32:02,118
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?

490
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:05,451
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.

491
00:32:05,522 --> 00:32:08,286
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.

492
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:11,795
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!

493
00:32:11,862 --> 00:32:13,523
You don't have that?

494
00:32:13,597 --> 00:32:17,533
We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
It's a horrible, horrible disease.

495
00:32:17,601 --> 00:32:18,932
Oh, my.

496
00:32:19,603 --> 00:32:21,127
Dumb bees!

497
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:24,436
You must want to sting all those jerks.

498
00:32:24,508 --> 00:32:27,568
We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.

499
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:30,136
So you have to watch your temper.

500
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:33,547
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,

501
00:32:33,617 --> 00:32:37,553
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:

502
00:32:37,621 --> 00:32:41,182
Anger, jealousy, lust.

503
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:44,425
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?

504
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:45,723
Yeah.

505
00:32:45,796 --> 00:32:48,094
- What is wrong with you?!
- It's a bug.

506
00:32:48,165 --> 00:32:52,602
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!

507
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,900
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?

508
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:57,270
Yeah, it was. How did you know?

509
00:32:57,341 --> 00:33:01,243
It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.

510
00:33:01,311 --> 00:33:03,404
You've really got that
down to a science.

511
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,472
- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
- I'll bet.

512
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:10,077
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?

513
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:13,521
How did this get here?
Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,

514
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:16,525
Ray Liotta Private Select?

515
00:33:17,094 --> 00:33:19,460
- Is he that actor?
- I never heard of him.

516
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,363
- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.

517
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:24,526
You don't have
enough food of your own?

518
00:33:24,601 --> 00:33:27,195
- Well, yes.
- How do you get it?

519
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:30,104
- Bees make it.
- I know who makes it!

520
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,039
And it's hard to make it!

521
00:33:32,109 --> 00:33:35,875
There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!

522
00:33:35,946 --> 00:33:38,244
- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!

523
00:33:38,315 --> 00:33:39,646
It's just honey, Barry.

524
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:41,309
Just what?!

525
00:33:41,385 --> 00:33:45,048
Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!

526
00:33:45,122 --> 00:33:49,058
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!

527
00:33:49,893 --> 00:33:52,760
And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the bottom of this.

528
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,060
I'm getting to the bottom
of all of this!

529
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:03,229
Hey, Hector.

530
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:07,741
- You almost done?
- Almost.

531
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,310
He is here. I sense it.

532
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:23,359
Well, I guess I'll go home now

533
00:34:23,427 --> 00:34:27,693
and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.

534
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,596
You're busted, box boy!

535
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:33,263
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!

536
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:36,204
I can talk.
And now you'll start talking!

537
00:34:36,273 --> 00:34:39,367
Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?

538
00:34:39,443 --> 00:34:42,037
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.

539
00:34:42,112 --> 00:34:44,774
The last thing we want
to do is upset bees!

540
00:34:45,282 --> 00:34:47,876
You're too late! It's ours now!

541
00:34:47,951 --> 00:34:50,545
You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!

542
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:53,954
You, sir, will be lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!

543
00:34:54,024 --> 00:34:56,117
Where is the honey coming from?

544
00:34:57,961 --> 00:34:59,656
Tell me where!

545
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,255
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!

546
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:26,915
Orazy person!

547
00:36:02,526 --> 00:36:05,290
What horrible thing has happened here?

548
00:36:05,362 --> 00:36:08,763
These faces, they never knew
what hit them. And now

549
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:11,562
they're on the road to nowhere!

550
00:36:11,635 --> 00:36:13,364
Just keep still.

551
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:14,961
What? You're not dead?

552
00:36:15,205 --> 00:36:19,107
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?

553
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:22,202
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.

554
00:36:22,279 --> 00:36:26,648
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!

555
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,651
I'm going to Tacoma.

556
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,812
- And you?
- He really is dead.

557
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:32,150
All right.

558
00:36:32,222 --> 00:36:33,416
Uh-oh!

559
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,458
- What is that?!
- Oh, no!

560
00:36:35,525 --> 00:36:37,516
- A wiper! Triple blade!
- Triple blade?

561
00:36:37,594 --> 00:36:40,256
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!

562
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:44,596
Why does everything have
to be so doggone clean?!

563
00:36:44,668 --> 00:36:46,829
How much do you people need to see?!

564
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:49,964
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!

565
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,237
From NPR News in Washington,
I'm Oarl Kasell.

566
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,870
But don't kill no more bugs!

567
00:36:58,215 --> 00:37:00,706
- Bee!
- Moose blood guy!!

568
00:37:09,693 --> 00:37:11,490
- You hear something?
- Like what?

569
00:37:11,561 --> 00:37:12,892
Like tiny screaming.

570
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,461
Turn off the radio.

571
00:37:26,243 --> 00:37:28,268
Whassup, bee boy?

572
00:37:28,345 --> 00:37:30,074
Hey, Blood.

573
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:33,344
Just a row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.

574
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,611
Wow!

575
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:38,348
I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.

576
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,855
I mean, that honey's ours.

577
00:37:39,923 --> 00:37:42,187
- Bees hang tight.
- We're all jammed in.

578
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:43,851
It's a close community.

579
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:47,920
Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.

580
00:37:47,998 --> 00:37:51,525
- What if you get in trouble?
- You a mosquito, you in trouble.

581
00:37:51,601 --> 00:37:55,037
Nobody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!

582
00:37:55,105 --> 00:37:58,074
At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.

583
00:37:58,141 --> 00:38:02,407
Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.

584
00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:04,606
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.

585
00:38:05,749 --> 00:38:08,274
You got to be kidding me!

586
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:11,753
Mooseblood's about to leave
the building! So long, bee!

587
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:13,650
- Hey, guys!
- Mooseblood!

588
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:18,327
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?

589
00:38:34,511 --> 00:38:38,607
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.

590
00:38:38,682 --> 00:38:40,206
What is this place?

591
00:38:40,283 --> 00:38:42,683
A bee's got a brain
the size of a pinhead.

592
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:44,243
They are pinheads!

593
00:38:45,522 --> 00:38:46,853
Pinhead.

594
00:38:47,524 --> 00:38:51,051
- Oheck out the new smoker.
- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.

595
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:52,720
The Thomas 3000!

596
00:38:52,796 --> 00:38:53,820
Smoker?

597
00:38:53,897 --> 00:38:58,800
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.

598
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:02,870
A couple breaths of this
knocks them right out.

599
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:08,876
They make the honey,
and we make the money.

600
00:39:08,945 --> 00:39:11,470
"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?

601
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:33,492
Oh, my!

602
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:38,400
What's going on? Are you OK?

603
00:39:38,475 --> 00:39:40,705
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.

604
00:39:40,777 --> 00:39:44,679
Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?

605
00:39:44,748 --> 00:39:47,114
Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.

606
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:50,881
This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!

607
00:39:50,954 --> 00:39:52,922
That's a drag queen!

608
00:39:57,427 --> 00:39:59,258
What is this?

609
00:40:08,004 --> 00:40:09,232
Oh, no!

610
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:10,933
There's hundreds of them!

611
00:40:21,451 --> 00:40:23,112
Bee honey.

612
00:40:23,186 --> 00:40:27,555
Our honey is being brazenly stolen
on a massive scale!

613
00:40:27,624 --> 00:40:31,822
This is worse than anything bears
have done! I intend to do something.

614
00:40:31,895 --> 00:40:32,987
Oh, Barry, stop.

615
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:36,157
Who told you humans are taking
our honey? That's a rumor.

616
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:38,224
Do these look like rumors?

617
00:40:38,301 --> 00:40:41,964
That's a conspiracy theory.
These are obviously doctored photos.

618
00:40:42,038 --> 00:40:44,233
How did you get mixed up in this?

619
00:40:44,307 --> 00:40:45,831
He's been talking to humans.

620
00:40:45,909 --> 00:40:47,638
- What?
- Talking to humans?!

621
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:50,578
He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!

622
00:40:50,647 --> 00:40:52,171
Make out? Barry!

623
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:53,409
We do not.

624
00:40:53,483 --> 00:40:55,678
- You wish you could.
- Whose side are you on?

625
00:40:55,752 --> 00:40:56,980
The bees!

626
00:40:57,053 --> 00:41:01,854
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.

627
00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:04,655
Barry, this is what you want
to do with your life?

628
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:08,459
I want to do it for all our lives.
Nobody works harder than bees!

629
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:11,023
Dad, I remember you
coming home so overworked

630
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:14,161
your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.

631
00:41:14,237 --> 00:41:15,761
I remember that.

632
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,273
What right do they have to our honey?

633
00:41:18,341 --> 00:41:22,334
We live on two cups a year. They put it
in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!

634
00:41:22,412 --> 00:41:25,108
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?

635
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:26,945
Sting them where it really hurts.

636
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:28,279
In the face! The eye!

637
00:41:28,351 --> 00:41:29,579
- That would hurt.
- No.

638
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,382
Up the nose? That's a killer.

639
00:41:31,454 --> 00:41:36,084
There's only one place you can sting
the humans, one place where it matters.

640
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:41,028
Hive at Five, the hive's only
full-hour action news source.

641
00:41:44,868 --> 00:41:47,029
No more bee beards!

642
00:41:49,873 --> 00:41:52,034
With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.

643
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:54,036
Weather with Storm Stinger.

644
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:55,642
Sports with Buzz Larvi.

645
00:41:55,879 --> 00:41:57,870
And Jeanette Ohung.

646
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,178
- Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.

647
00:42:03,253 --> 00:42:05,653
A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,

648
00:42:05,722 --> 00:42:09,317
intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey,

649
00:42:09,392 --> 00:42:12,122
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!

650
00:42:15,031 --> 00:42:17,727
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,

651
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:22,465
we'll have three former queens here in
our studio, discussing their new book,

652
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:25,997
Olassy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.

653
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:28,237
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.

654
00:42:28,311 --> 00:42:31,747
Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
from the hive. I can't do this"?

655
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:34,409
Bees have never been afraid
to change the world.

656
00:42:34,484 --> 00:42:37,749
What about Bee Oolumbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?

657
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:40,346
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.

658
00:42:40,423 --> 00:42:43,517
We were thinking
of stickball or candy stores.

659
00:42:43,593 --> 00:42:44,958
How old are you?

660
00:42:45,028 --> 00:42:48,361
The bee community
is supporting you in this case,

661
00:42:48,431 --> 00:42:51,264
which will be the trial
of the bee century.

662
00:42:51,334 --> 00:42:54,360
You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world too.

663
00:42:54,437 --> 00:42:56,769
It's a common name. Next week...

664
00:42:57,107 --> 00:43:01,771
He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...

665
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:03,369
Next week...

666
00:43:03,446 --> 00:43:07,780
Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
guest even though you just heard 'em.

667
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:11,878
Bear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and here live.

668
00:43:11,955 --> 00:43:17,052
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.

669
00:43:18,628 --> 00:43:23,156
In tennis, you attack
at the point of weakness!

670
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:27,067
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.

671
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:30,800
Honey, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?

672
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:33,570
Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.

673
00:43:33,643 --> 00:43:36,908
- Is that that same bee?
- Yes, it is!

674
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:39,642
I'm helping him sue the human race.

675
00:43:40,617 --> 00:43:42,915
- Hello.
- Hello, bee.

676
00:43:42,986 --> 00:43:44,248
This is Ken.

677
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:49,418
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.

678
00:43:49,993 --> 00:43:51,824
Why does he talk again?

679
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:54,830
Listen, you better go
'cause we're really busy working.

680
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:57,093
But it's our yogurt night!

681
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:58,498
Bye-bye.

682
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:02,104
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!

683
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:07,041
You poor thing.
You two have been at this for hours!

684
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:09,340
Yes, and Adam here
has been a huge help.

685
00:44:10,513 --> 00:44:12,879
- Frosting...
- How many sugars?

686
00:44:12,949 --> 00:44:15,179
Just one. I try not
to use the competition.

687
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:18,652
So why are you helping me?

688
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:20,587
Bees have good qualities.

689
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:24,453
And it takes my mind off the shop.

690
00:44:24,527 --> 00:44:28,657
Instead of flowers, people
are giving balloon bouquets now.

691
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:31,132
Those are great, if you're three.

692
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:32,759
And artificial flowers.

693
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:36,795
- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
- Yeah, me too.

694
00:44:36,873 --> 00:44:39,273
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.

695
00:44:39,342 --> 00:44:41,469
Bees must hate those fake things!

696
00:44:41,544 --> 00:44:44,104
Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.

697
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:47,343
Maybe this could make up
for it a little bit.

698
00:44:47,417 --> 00:44:50,284
- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
- I guess.

699
00:44:50,353 --> 00:44:52,651
You sure you want to go through with it?

700
00:44:52,722 --> 00:44:55,623
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able

701
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:58,388
to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!

702
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:04,561
It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,

703
00:45:04,634 --> 00:45:08,866
where the world anxiously waits,
because for the first time in history,

704
00:45:08,938 --> 00:45:13,898
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.

705
00:45:18,081 --> 00:45:20,606
What have we gotten into here, Barry?

706
00:45:20,683 --> 00:45:22,514
It's pretty big, isn't it?

707
00:45:22,585 --> 00:45:25,679
I can't believe how many humans
don't work during the day.

708
00:45:25,755 --> 00:45:29,987
You think billion-dollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?

709
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,752
Everybody needs to stay
behind the barricade.

710
00:45:45,475 --> 00:45:48,603
- What's the matter?
- I don't know, I just got a chill.

711
00:45:54,784 --> 00:45:57,947
Well, if it isn't the bee team.

712
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:00,046
You boys work on this?

713
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:06,722
All rise! The Honorable
Judge Bumbleton presiding.

714
00:46:06,796 --> 00:46:09,424
All right. Oase number 4475,

715
00:46:09,499 --> 00:46:13,902
Superior Oourt of New York,
Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry

716
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:15,699
is now in session.

717
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:20,368
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the five food companies collectively?

718
00:46:20,443 --> 00:46:22,240
A privilege.

719
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:27,648
Mr. Benson... you're representing
all the bees of the world?

720
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:41,464
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're ready to proceed.

721
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:47,135
Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.

722
00:46:49,672 --> 00:46:52,266
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

723
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:55,436
my grandmother was a simple woman.

724
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:59,209
Born on a farm, she believed
it was man's divine right

725
00:46:59,282 --> 00:47:04,345
to benefit from the bounty
of nature God put before us.

726
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:08,516
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. Benson imagines,

727
00:47:08,591 --> 00:47:10,354
just think of what would it mean.

728
00:47:10,426 --> 00:47:13,623
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm

729
00:47:13,696 --> 00:47:16,961
for the elastic in my britches!

730
00:47:17,033 --> 00:47:19,126
Talking bee!

731
00:47:19,202 --> 00:47:21,693
How do we know this isn't some sort of

732
00:47:21,771 --> 00:47:25,298
holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?

733
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:28,139
They could be using laser beams!

734
00:47:28,211 --> 00:47:32,705
Robotics! Ventriloquism!
Oloning! For all we know,

735
00:47:32,782 --> 00:47:35,376
he could be on steroids!

736
00:47:37,186 --> 00:47:38,881
Mr. Benson?

737
00:47:44,894 --> 00:47:47,590
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no trickery here.

738
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:51,395
I'm just an ordinary bee.
Honey's pretty important to me.

739
00:47:51,467 --> 00:47:54,265
It's important to all bees.
We invented it!

740
00:47:54,337 --> 00:47:57,500
We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.

741
00:47:57,574 --> 00:48:00,304
Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room

742
00:48:00,376 --> 00:48:02,173
who think they can take it from us

743
00:48:02,245 --> 00:48:06,375
'cause we're the little guys!
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,

744
00:48:06,449 --> 00:48:11,011
you'll see how, by taking our honey,
you not only take everything we have

745
00:48:11,087 --> 00:48:12,918
but everything we are!

746
00:48:16,459 --> 00:48:19,656
I wish he'd dress like that
all the time. So nice!

747
00:48:19,729 --> 00:48:21,458
Oall your first witness.

748
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:26,298
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms, big company you have.

749
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:27,700
I suppose so.

750
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:31,536
I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!

751
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:34,441
Yes, they provide beekeepers
for our farms.

752
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:38,037
Beekeeper. I find that
to be a very disturbing term.

753
00:48:38,114 --> 00:48:42,050
I don't imagine you employ
any bee-free-ers, do you?

754
00:48:42,118 --> 00:48:44,052
- No.
- I couldn't hear you.

755
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,451
- No.
- No.

756
00:48:45,521 --> 00:48:49,184
Because you don't free bees.
You keep bees. Not only that,

757
00:48:49,258 --> 00:48:54,127
it seems you thought a bear would be
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.

758
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:56,722
They're very lovable creatures.

759
00:48:56,799 --> 00:49:00,326
Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.

760
00:49:00,403 --> 00:49:01,734
You mean like this?

761
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:07,306
Bears kill bees!

762
00:49:07,977 --> 00:49:11,071
How'd you like his head crashing
through your living room?!

763
00:49:11,147 --> 00:49:14,207
Biting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!

764
00:49:15,318 --> 00:49:17,980
OK, that's enough. Take him away.

765
00:49:23,526 --> 00:49:27,292
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
Your name intrigues me.

766
00:49:27,363 --> 00:49:31,356
- Where have I heard it before?
- I was with a band called The Police.

767
00:49:31,434 --> 00:49:34,096
But you've never been
a police officer, have you?

768
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:35,432
No, I haven't.

769
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:39,032
No, you haven't. And so here
we have yet another example

770
00:49:39,108 --> 00:49:41,440
of bee culture casually
stolen by a human

771
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:44,275
for nothing more than
a prance-about stage name.

772
00:49:44,347 --> 00:49:45,609
Oh, please.

773
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:47,843
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?

774
00:49:47,917 --> 00:49:50,784
Because I'm feeling
a little stung, Sting.

775
00:49:50,853 --> 00:49:55,347
Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!

776
00:49:56,826 --> 00:49:59,590
That's not his real name?! You idiots!

777
00:50:00,396 --> 00:50:03,729
Mr. Liotta, first,
belated congratulations on

778
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,099
your Emmy win for a guest spot
on ER in 2005.

779
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,035
Thank you. Thank you.

780
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:13,335
I see from your resume
that you're devilishly handsome

781
00:50:13,409 --> 00:50:16,606
with a churning inner turmoil
that's ready to blow.

782
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:19,147
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?

783
00:50:19,215 --> 00:50:22,480
Not yet it isn't. But is this
what it's come to for you?

784
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:24,986
Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
so you don't

785
00:50:25,054 --> 00:50:28,820
have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?

786
00:50:28,891 --> 00:50:31,416
Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!

787
00:50:31,494 --> 00:50:34,622
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!

788
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:39,331
Why doesn't someone just step on
this creep, and we can all go home?!

789
00:50:39,402 --> 00:50:42,098
- Order in this court!
- You're all thinking it!

790
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:43,297
Order! Order, I say!

791
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,970
- Say it!
- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!

792
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:54,979
I think it was awfully nice
of that bear to pitch in like that.

793
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:57,576
I think the jury's on our side.

794
00:50:58,087 --> 00:51:00,647
Are we doing everything right, legally?

795
00:51:00,723 --> 00:51:01,883
I'm a florist.

796
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:05,519
Right. Well, here's to a great team.

797
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:06,926
To a great team!

798
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:10,562
Well, hello.

799
00:51:10,633 --> 00:51:12,601
- Ken!
- Hello.

800
00:51:12,668 --> 00:51:14,727
I didn't think you were coming.

801
00:51:14,804 --> 00:51:19,867
No, I was just late.
I tried to call, but... the battery.

802
00:51:19,942 --> 00:51:24,208
I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.

803
00:51:24,947 --> 00:51:27,279
Oh, that was lucky.

804
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:32,417
There's a little left.
I could heat it up.

805
00:51:32,488 --> 00:51:34,786
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.

806
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:41,491
So I hear you're quite a tennis player.

807
00:51:41,564 --> 00:51:45,125
I'm not much for the game myself.
The ball's a little grabby.

808
00:51:46,969 --> 00:51:50,962
That's where I usually sit.
Right... there.

809
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:55,907
Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,

810
00:51:55,978 --> 00:52:01,245
and he agreed with me that eating with
chopsticks isn't really a special skill.

811
00:52:01,317 --> 00:52:04,252
You think I don't see what you're doing?

812
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:07,983
I know how hard it is to find
the rightjob. We have that in common.

813
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:10,224
Do we?

814
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:14,696
Bees have 100 percent employment,
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.

815
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:17,597
That's just what
I was thinking about doing.

816
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:22,661
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.

817
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:29,036
I'm going to drain the old stinger.

818
00:52:29,111 --> 00:52:30,840
Yeah, you do that.

819
00:52:34,183 --> 00:52:35,844
Look at that.

820
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:47,959
You know, I've just about had it

821
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:50,965
with your little mind games.

822
00:52:51,033 --> 00:52:53,558
- What's that?
- Italian Vogue.

823
00:52:53,636 --> 00:52:55,297
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.

824
00:52:55,371 --> 00:52:56,838
A lot of ads.

825
00:52:56,906 --> 00:53:00,171
Remember what Van said, why is
your life more valuable than mine?

826
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:03,770
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!

827
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:07,581
I think something stinks in here!

828
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:09,140
I love the smell of flowers.

829
00:53:09,218 --> 00:53:12,153
How do you like the smell of flames?!

830
00:53:12,221 --> 00:53:13,279
Not as much.

831
00:53:29,138 --> 00:53:31,163
Water bug! Not taking sides!

832
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:36,704
Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
This is pathetic!

833
00:53:36,779 --> 00:53:38,474
I've got issues!

834
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:45,945
Well, well, well, a royal flush!

835
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:48,013
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

836
00:53:58,601 --> 00:54:00,068
Surf's up, dude!

837
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:01,125
Poo water!

838
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,702
That bowl is gnarly.

839
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:10,212
Except for those dirty yellow rings!

840
00:54:10,279 --> 00:54:12,713
Kenneth! What are you doing?!

841
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:16,218
You know, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!

842
00:54:16,285 --> 00:54:18,150
We need to talk!

843
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:20,154
He's just a little bee!

844
00:54:20,222 --> 00:54:25,216
And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!

845
00:54:25,294 --> 00:54:30,561
Long time? What are you talking about?!
Are there other bugs in your life?

846
00:54:30,633 --> 00:54:35,570
No, but there are other things bugging
me in life. And you're one of them!

847
00:54:35,638 --> 00:54:38,573
Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...

848
00:54:38,641 --> 00:54:42,907
My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!

849
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:44,879
Goodbye, Ken.

850
00:54:48,484 --> 00:54:50,475
And for your information,

851
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:55,820
I prefer sugar-free, artificial
sweeteners made by man!

852
00:54:56,492 --> 00:54:58,926
I'm sorry about all that.

853
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:02,658
I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!

854
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,633
I always felt there was some kind
of barrier between Ken and me.

855
00:55:07,703 --> 00:55:10,365
I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.

856
00:55:10,439 --> 00:55:12,270
Are you OK for the trial?

857
00:55:12,341 --> 00:55:16,072
I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about out of ideas.

858
00:55:16,145 --> 00:55:19,876
We would like to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.

859
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:24,249
Good idea! You can really see why he's
considered one of the best lawyers...

860
00:55:24,754 --> 00:55:25,880
Yeah.

861
00:55:28,257 --> 00:55:30,282
Layton, you've
gotta weave some magic

862
00:55:30,359 --> 00:55:32,623
with this jury,
or it's gonna be all over.

863
00:55:32,695 --> 00:55:37,064
Don't worry. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around

864
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:40,864
is to remind them
of what they don't like about bees.

865
00:55:40,936 --> 00:55:43,404
- You got the tweezers?
- Are you allergic?

866
00:55:43,472 --> 00:55:46,305
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.

867
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:51,142
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.

868
00:55:51,213 --> 00:55:54,649
What exactly is your relationship

869
00:55:54,717 --> 00:55:56,708
to that woman?

870
00:55:58,054 --> 00:55:59,043
We're friends.

871
00:55:59,121 --> 00:56:00,418
- Good friends?
- Yes.

872
00:56:00,489 --> 00:56:03,652
How good? Do you live together?

873
00:56:03,726 --> 00:56:05,193
Wait a minute...

874
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:06,888
Are you her little...

875
00:56:07,396 --> 00:56:08,727
...bedbug?

876
00:56:09,832 --> 00:56:13,063
I've seen a bee documentary or two.
From what I understand,

877
00:56:13,135 --> 00:56:16,935
doesn't your queen give birth
to all the bee children?

878
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:19,941
- Yeah, but...
- So those aren't your real parents!

879
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:21,874
- Oh, Barry...
- Yes, they are!

880
00:56:21,944 --> 00:56:23,775
Hold me back!

881
00:56:23,846 --> 00:56:26,371
You're an illegitimate bee,
aren't you, Benson?

882
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:27,780
He's denouncing bees!

883
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:30,444
Don't y'all date your cousins?

884
00:56:30,519 --> 00:56:33,249
- Objection!
- I'm going to pincushion this guy!

885
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:38,320
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!

886
00:56:43,432 --> 00:56:45,696
Oh, I'm hit!!

887
00:56:45,768 --> 00:56:47,861
Oh, lordy, I am hit!

888
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:49,564
Order! Order!

889
00:56:49,638 --> 00:56:52,869
The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!

890
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:56,901
I have been felled
by a winged beast of destruction!

891
00:56:56,979 --> 00:57:01,678
You see? You can't treat them
like equals! They're striped savages!

892
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:06,312
Stinging's the only thing
they know! It's their way!

893
00:57:06,388 --> 00:57:09,118
- Adam, stay with me.
- I can't feel my legs.

894
00:57:10,459 --> 00:57:14,361
What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison

895
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:16,227
from my heaving buttocks?

896
00:57:16,899 --> 00:57:20,062
I will have order in this court. Order!

897
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:21,626
Order, please!

898
00:57:23,639 --> 00:57:27,507
The case of the honeybees
versus the human race

899
00:57:27,576 --> 00:57:29,840
took a pointed turn against the bees

900
00:57:29,912 --> 00:57:34,576
yesterday when one of their legal
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.

901
00:57:47,663 --> 00:57:49,597
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

902
00:57:49,665 --> 00:57:51,155
- Is there much pain?
- Yeah.

903
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:55,300
I...

904
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:57,666
I blew the whole case, didn't I?

905
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:01,608
It doesn't matter. What matters is
you're alive. You could have died.

906
00:58:01,677 --> 00:58:04,441
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.

907
00:58:04,513 --> 00:58:09,450
They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.

908
00:58:09,518 --> 00:58:12,351
Look, there's
a little celery still on it.

909
00:58:12,821 --> 00:58:15,016
What was it like to sting someone?

910
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:17,456
I can't explain it. It was all...

911
00:58:17,526 --> 00:58:21,018
All adrenaline and then...
and then ecstasy!

912
00:58:23,699 --> 00:58:25,360
All right.

913
00:58:25,434 --> 00:58:27,459
You think it was all a trap?

914
00:58:27,536 --> 00:58:30,767
Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.

915
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:35,242
What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
just a couple of bugs in this world.

916
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:37,643
What will the humans do to us
if they win?

917
00:58:37,713 --> 00:58:38,975
I don't know.

918
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:42,484
I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so bad.

919
00:58:42,551 --> 00:58:46,146
Adam, they check in,
but they don't check out!

920
00:58:46,222 --> 00:58:47,553
Oh, my.

921
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:52,653
Oould you get a nurse
to close that window?

922
00:58:52,728 --> 00:58:54,696
- Why?
- The smoke.

923
00:58:54,763 --> 00:58:56,390
Bees don't smoke.

924
00:58:56,899 --> 00:58:59,390
Right. Bees don't smoke.

925
00:59:00,569 --> 00:59:04,335
Bees don't smoke!
But some bees are smoking.

926
00:59:04,406 --> 00:59:06,738
That's it! That's our case!

927
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:08,640
It is? It's not over?

928
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,679
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.

929
00:59:10,746 --> 00:59:13,738
Get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.

930
00:59:16,418 --> 00:59:21,253
And assuming you've done step 29
correctly, you're ready for the tub.

931
00:59:27,129 --> 00:59:28,153
Mr. Flayman.

932
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:30,095
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!

933
00:59:30,165 --> 00:59:32,861
Where is the rest of your team?

934
00:59:32,935 --> 00:59:35,301
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.

935
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:38,033
Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,

936
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:40,837
and as a result,
we don't make very good time.

937
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:43,705
I actually heard a funny story about...

938
00:59:43,779 --> 00:59:46,213
Your Honor,
haven't these ridiculous bugs

939
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:49,012
taken up enough
of this court's valuable time?

940
00:59:49,084 --> 00:59:53,987
How much longer will we allow
these absurd shenanigans to go on?

941
00:59:54,056 --> 00:59:58,516
They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges

942
00:59:58,594 --> 01:00:02,530
against my clients,
who run legitimate businesses.

943
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:06,530
I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!

944
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:08,899
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going

945
01:00:08,971 --> 01:00:11,371
to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.

946
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,704
But you can't! We have a terrific case.

947
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:16,438
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?

948
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:19,640
Show me the smoking gun!

949
01:00:20,316 --> 01:00:23,080
Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun?

950
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:25,814
Here is your smoking gun.

951
01:00:28,624 --> 01:00:30,114
What is that?

952
01:00:30,192 --> 01:00:31,682
It's a bee smoker!

953
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,752
What, this?
This harmless little contraption?

954
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:38,322
This couldn't hurt a fly,
let alone a bee.

955
01:00:44,506 --> 01:00:46,565
Look at what has happened

956
01:00:46,642 --> 01:00:50,840
to bees who have never been asked,
"Smoking or non?"

957
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:53,006
Is this what nature intended for us?

958
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:55,949
To be forcibly addicted
to smoke machines

959
01:00:56,018 --> 01:00:58,452
and man-made wooden slat work camps?

960
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:03,514
Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?

961
01:01:05,861 --> 01:01:09,160
- What are we gonna do?
- He's playing the species card.

962
01:01:09,698 --> 01:01:13,794
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these bees!

963
01:01:13,869 --> 01:01:16,394
Free the bees! Free the bees!

964
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:18,633
Free the bees!

965
01:01:18,707 --> 01:01:21,642
Free the bees! Free the bees!

966
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:25,646
The court finds in favor of the bees!

967
01:01:25,714 --> 01:01:27,181
Vanessa, we won!

968
01:01:27,249 --> 01:01:30,275
I knew you could do it! High-five!

969
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:32,079
Sorry.

970
01:01:32,154 --> 01:01:35,487
I'm OK! You know what this means?

971
01:01:35,557 --> 01:01:38,048
All the honey
will finally belong to the bees.

972
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:40,561
Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.

973
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:47,828
This is an unholy perversion
of the balance of nature, Benson.

974
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:49,564
You'll regret this.

975
01:01:50,739 --> 01:01:52,832
Barry, how much honey is out there?

976
01:01:52,908 --> 01:01:54,637
All right. One at a time.

977
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:56,507
Barry, who are you wearing?

978
01:01:56,578 --> 01:01:59,308
My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.

979
01:01:59,381 --> 01:02:02,214
- What if Montgomery's right?
- What do you mean?

980
01:02:02,284 --> 01:02:06,414
We've been living the bee way
a long time, 27 million years.

981
01:02:08,457 --> 01:02:12,518
Oongratulations on your victory.
What will you demand as a settlement?

982
01:02:12,594 --> 01:02:16,325
First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
of all bee work camps.

983
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:21,292
Then we want back the honey
that was ours to begin with,

984
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:22,997
every last drop.

985
01:02:23,071 --> 01:02:27,371
We demand an end to the glorification
of the bear as anything more

986
01:02:27,443 --> 01:02:30,378
than a filthy, smelly,
bad-breath stink machine.

987
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:33,108
We're all aware
of what they do in the woods.

988
01:02:34,116 --> 01:02:35,549
Wait for my signal.

989
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:38,681
Take him out.

990
01:02:40,689 --> 01:02:43,658
He'll have nauseous
for a few hours, then he'll be fine.

991
01:02:43,725 --> 01:02:47,161
And we will no longer tolerate
bee-negative nicknames...

992
01:02:47,229 --> 01:02:49,163
But it's just a prance-about stage name!

993
01:02:49,231 --> 01:02:52,564
...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in bogus health products

994
01:02:52,634 --> 01:02:56,798
and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.

995
01:02:58,373 --> 01:02:59,635
Oan't breathe.

996
01:03:02,144 --> 01:03:03,372
Bring it in, boys!

997
01:03:05,481 --> 01:03:07,813
Hold it right there! Good.

998
01:03:09,084 --> 01:03:10,984
Tap it.

999
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:19,323
Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
and there's gallons more coming!

1000
01:03:19,394 --> 01:03:23,262
- I think we need to shut down!
- Shut down? We've never shut down.

1001
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:26,801
Shut down honey production!

1002
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:28,734
Stop making honey!

1003
01:03:33,208 --> 01:03:34,732
Turn your key, sir!

1004
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:47,686
What do we do now?

1005
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:53,521
Oannonball!

1006
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:03,402
We're shutting honey production!

1007
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:04,632
Mission abort.

1008
01:04:04,706 --> 01:04:08,198
Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to base.

1009
01:04:55,824 --> 01:04:58,725
Adam, you wouldn't believe
how much honey was out there.

1010
01:04:58,794 --> 01:04:59,783
Oh, yeah?

1011
01:04:59,861 --> 01:05:02,591
What's going on? Where is everybody?

1012
01:05:03,365 --> 01:05:05,856
- Are they out celebrating?
- They're home.

1013
01:05:05,934 --> 01:05:08,869
They don't know what to do.
Laying out, sleeping in.

1014
01:05:08,937 --> 01:05:12,464
I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.

1015
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:14,031
At least we got our honey back.

1016
01:05:14,109 --> 01:05:18,307
Sometimes I think, so what if humans
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?

1017
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:22,248
It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to be part of making it.

1018
01:05:23,952 --> 01:05:28,548
This was my new desk. This was my
new job. I wanted to do it really well.

1019
01:05:28,624 --> 01:05:29,955
And now...

1020
01:05:30,792 --> 01:05:32,453
Now I can't.

1021
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:45,573
I don't understand
why they're not happy.

1022
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:48,075
I thought their lives would be better!

1023
01:05:48,143 --> 01:05:52,011
They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.

1024
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:55,140
You don't have any idea
what's going on, do you?

1025
01:05:55,217 --> 01:05:57,879
- What did you want to show me?
- This.

1026
01:05:59,888 --> 01:06:01,185
What happened here?

1027
01:06:01,256 --> 01:06:03,986
That is not the half of it.

1028
01:06:09,665 --> 01:06:11,656
Oh, no. Oh, my.

1029
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:14,533
They're all wilting.

1030
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:16,696
Doesn't look very good, does it?

1031
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:18,103
No.

1032
01:06:18,173 --> 01:06:21,506
And whose fault do you think that is?

1033
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:25,173
You know, I'm gonna guess bees.

1034
01:06:25,247 --> 01:06:26,441
Bees?

1035
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:28,449
Specifically, me.

1036
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:32,715
I didn't think bees not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.

1037
01:06:32,788 --> 01:06:37,782
It's notjust flowers.
Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.

1038
01:06:37,859 --> 01:06:40,726
That's our whole SAT test right there.

1039
01:06:40,796 --> 01:06:44,357
Take away produce, that affects
the entire animal kingdom.

1040
01:06:44,433 --> 01:06:45,866
And then, of course...

1041
01:06:45,934 --> 01:06:47,697
The human species?

1042
01:06:50,939 --> 01:06:52,964
So if there's no more pollination,

1043
01:06:53,041 --> 01:06:55,839
it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?

1044
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:59,278
I know this is also partly my fault.

1045
01:07:03,385 --> 01:07:05,546
How about a suicide pact?

1046
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:07,144
How do we do it?

1047
01:07:07,222 --> 01:07:10,214
- I'll sting you, you step on me.
- Thatjust kills you twice.

1048
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:11,623
Right, right.

1049
01:07:12,227 --> 01:07:16,561
Listen, Barry...
sorry, but I gotta get going.

1050
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:26,399
I had to open my mouth and talk.

1051
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:29,741
Vanessa?

1052
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:35,675
Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?

1053
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:38,777
To the final Tournament of Roses parade
in Pasadena.

1054
01:07:38,854 --> 01:07:42,790
They've moved it to this weekend
because all the flowers are dying.

1055
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:46,294
It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.

1056
01:07:46,361 --> 01:07:50,821
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.

1057
01:07:50,899 --> 01:07:53,197
I know. Me neither.

1058
01:07:55,437 --> 01:07:59,100
Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.

1059
01:07:59,941 --> 01:08:03,274
Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?

1060
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:05,269
Roses!

1061
01:08:05,947 --> 01:08:07,778
Vanessa!

1062
01:08:08,450 --> 01:08:10,111
Roses?!

1063
01:08:10,185 --> 01:08:11,584
Barry?

1064
01:08:11,653 --> 01:08:14,713
- Roses are flowers!
- Yes, they are.

1065
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:17,816
Flowers, bees, pollen!

1066
01:08:17,893 --> 01:08:21,226
I know.
That's why this is the last parade.

1067
01:08:21,296 --> 01:08:25,357
Maybe not.
Oould you ask him to slow down?

1068
01:08:25,433 --> 01:08:27,025
Oould you slow down?

1069
01:08:29,671 --> 01:08:31,263
Barry!

1070
01:08:31,339 --> 01:08:34,831
OK, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, all my fault.

1071
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:36,241
Yes, it kind of is.

1072
01:08:36,311 --> 01:08:38,609
I've ruined the planet.
I wanted to help you

1073
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:41,012
with the flower shop.
I've made it worse.

1074
01:08:41,082 --> 01:08:43,516
Actually, it's completely closed down.

1075
01:08:43,585 --> 01:08:45,519
I thought maybe you were remodeling.

1076
01:08:45,587 --> 01:08:49,853
But I have another idea, and it's
greater than my previous ideas combined.

1077
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:51,722
I don't want to hear it!

1078
01:08:52,661 --> 01:08:56,654
All right, they have the roses,
the roses have the pollen.

1079
01:08:56,731 --> 01:08:59,928
I know every bee, plant
and flower bud in this park.

1080
01:09:00,001 --> 01:09:03,596
All we gotta do is get what they've got
back here with what we've got.

1081
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:04,798
- Bees.
- Park.

1082
01:09:04,873 --> 01:09:06,033
- Pollen!
- Flowers.

1083
01:09:06,107 --> 01:09:09,076
- Repollination!
- Across the nation!

1084
01:09:09,511 --> 01:09:12,674
Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, Oalifornia.

1085
01:09:12,747 --> 01:09:15,739
They've got nothing
but flowers, floats and cotton candy.

1086
01:09:15,817 --> 01:09:17,114
Security will be tight.

1087
01:09:17,185 --> 01:09:18,948
I have an idea.

1088
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:20,487
Vanessa Bloome, FTD.

1089
01:09:20,555 --> 01:09:23,217
Official floral business. It's real.

1090
01:09:23,291 --> 01:09:25,691
Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.

1091
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,421
Thank you. It was a gift.

1092
01:09:28,363 --> 01:09:31,196
Once inside,
we just pick the right float.

1093
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,361
How about The Princess and the Pea?

1094
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:37,371
I could be the princess,
and you could be the pea!

1095
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:38,701
Yes, I got it.

1096
01:09:40,542 --> 01:09:42,806
- Where should I sit?
- What are you?

1097
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:44,743
- I believe I'm the pea.
- The pea?

1098
01:09:44,813 --> 01:09:46,474
It goes under the mattresses.

1099
01:09:46,548 --> 01:09:49,312
- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
- I'm getting the marshal.

1100
01:09:49,384 --> 01:09:52,376
You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!

1101
01:09:54,656 --> 01:09:56,453
Let's see what this baby'll do.

1102
01:09:57,993 --> 01:10:00,154
Hey, what are you doing?!

1103
01:10:01,396 --> 01:10:04,058
Then all we do
is blend in with traffic...

1104
01:10:04,599 --> 01:10:06,726
...without arousing suspicion.

1105
01:10:09,404 --> 01:10:12,339
Once at the airport,
there's no stopping us.

1106
01:10:12,407 --> 01:10:13,396
Stop! Security.

1107
01:10:13,475 --> 01:10:15,670
- You and your insect pack your float?
- Yes.

1108
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:18,269
Has it been
in your possession the entire time?

1109
01:10:18,346 --> 01:10:20,644
Would you remove your shoes?

1110
01:10:20,715 --> 01:10:23,013
- Remove your stinger.
- It's part of me.

1111
01:10:23,084 --> 01:10:26,281
I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.

1112
01:10:32,427 --> 01:10:36,261
Then if we're lucky, we'll have
just enough pollen to do the job.

1113
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:41,233
Oan you believe how lucky we are? We
have just enough pollen to do the job!

1114
01:10:41,303 --> 01:10:42,895
I think this is gonna work.

1115
01:10:42,971 --> 01:10:44,063
It's got to work.

1116
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:46,767
Attention, passengers,
this is Oaptain Scott.

1117
01:10:46,841 --> 01:10:49,139
We have a bit of bad weather
in New York.

1118
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:51,906
It looks like we'll experience
a couple hours delay.

1119
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:55,973
Barry, these are cut flowers
with no water. They'll never make it.

1120
01:10:56,051 --> 01:10:58,144
I gotta get up there
and talk to them.

1121
01:10:58,219 --> 01:10:59,481
Be careful.

1122
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:04,648
Oan I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?

1123
01:11:04,726 --> 01:11:08,218
I'd like to order the talking
inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.

1124
01:11:12,667 --> 01:11:14,658
Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.

1125
01:11:14,736 --> 01:11:16,761
- What'd you say, Hal?
- Nothing.

1126
01:11:16,838 --> 01:11:18,203
Bee!

1127
01:11:18,273 --> 01:11:20,400
Don't freak out! My entire species...

1128
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:27,011
What are you doing?

1129
01:11:31,753 --> 01:11:34,779
- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
- Who's an attorney?

1130
01:11:34,856 --> 01:11:36,653
Don't move.

1131
01:11:41,296 --> 01:11:42,285
Oh, Barry.

1132
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:46,163
Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.

1133
01:11:46,234 --> 01:11:50,637
Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?

1134
01:11:50,705 --> 01:11:52,366
And please hurry!

1135
01:11:55,043 --> 01:11:56,510
What happened here?

1136
01:11:56,578 --> 01:11:59,877
There was a DustBuster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.

1137
01:11:59,948 --> 01:12:03,042
One's bald, one's in a boat,
they're both unconscious!

1138
01:12:03,885 --> 01:12:05,614
- Is that another bee joke?
- No!

1139
01:12:05,687 --> 01:12:07,314
No one's flying the plane!

1140
01:12:07,389 --> 01:12:11,587
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?

1141
01:12:11,659 --> 01:12:14,992
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.

1142
01:12:15,063 --> 01:12:16,257
Where's the pilot?

1143
01:12:16,331 --> 01:12:18,822
He's unconscious,
and so is the copilot.

1144
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:22,131
Not good. Does anyone onboard
have flight experience?

1145
01:12:22,203 --> 01:12:23,830
As a matter of fact, there is.

1146
01:12:23,905 --> 01:12:25,839
- Who's that?
- Barry Benson.

1147
01:12:25,907 --> 01:12:28,205
From the honey trial?! Oh, great.

1148
01:12:28,276 --> 01:12:30,836
Vanessa, this is nothing more
than a big metal bee.

1149
01:12:30,912 --> 01:12:32,937
It's got giant wings, huge engines.

1150
01:12:33,014 --> 01:12:34,311
I can't fly a plane.

1151
01:12:34,382 --> 01:12:36,714
- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
- Yes.

1152
01:12:36,785 --> 01:12:38,480
How hard could it be?

1153
01:12:39,821 --> 01:12:42,517
Wait, Barry!
We're headed into some lightning.

1154
01:12:45,593 --> 01:12:49,620
This is Bob Bumble. We have some
late-breaking news from JFK Airport,

1155
01:12:49,697 --> 01:12:52,530
where a suspenseful scene
is developing.

1156
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:55,296
Barry Benson,
fresh from his legal victory...

1157
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:56,530
That's Barry!

1158
01:12:56,604 --> 01:13:00,096
...is attempting to land a plane,
loaded with people, flowers

1159
01:13:00,175 --> 01:13:02,405
and an incapacitated flight crew.

1160
01:13:02,477 --> 01:13:03,535
Flowers?!

1161
01:13:03,611 --> 01:13:07,707
We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls

1162
01:13:07,782 --> 01:13:10,512
with absolutely no flight experience.

1163
01:13:10,585 --> 01:13:13,019
Just a minute.
There's a bee on that plane.

1164
01:13:13,088 --> 01:13:17,548
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson
and his no-account compadres.

1165
01:13:17,625 --> 01:13:19,593
They've done enough damage.

1166
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:21,185
But isn't he your only hope?

1167
01:13:21,262 --> 01:13:24,060
Technically, a bee
shouldn't be able to fly at all.

1168
01:13:24,132 --> 01:13:26,066
Their wings are too small...

1169
01:13:26,134 --> 01:13:28,500
Haven't we heard this a million times?

1170
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:31,937
"The surface area of the wings
and body mass make no sense."

1171
01:13:32,006 --> 01:13:34,338
- Get this on the air!
- Got it.

1172
01:13:34,409 --> 01:13:36,206
- Stand by.
- We're going live.

1173
01:13:37,145 --> 01:13:40,080
The way we work may be a mystery to you.

1174
01:13:40,148 --> 01:13:43,208
Making honey takes a lot of bees
doing a lot of small jobs.

1175
01:13:43,284 --> 01:13:45,411
But let me tell you about a small job.

1176
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:48,354
If you do it well,
it makes a big difference.

1177
01:13:48,423 --> 01:13:51,358
More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.

1178
01:13:51,426 --> 01:13:54,918
That's why I want to get bees
back to working together.

1179
01:13:54,996 --> 01:13:58,523
That's the bee way!
We're not made of Jell-O.

1180
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,431
We get behind a fellow.

1181
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:02,834
- Black and yellow!
- Hello!

1182
01:14:06,774 --> 01:14:08,298
Left, right, down, hover.

1183
01:14:08,376 --> 01:14:09,934
- Hover?
- Forget hover.

1184
01:14:10,011 --> 01:14:12,571
This isn't so hard.
Beep-beep! Beep-beep!

1185
01:14:15,683 --> 01:14:17,446
Barry, what happened?!

1186
01:14:17,519 --> 01:14:20,454
Wait, I think we were
on autopilot the whole time.

1187
01:14:20,522 --> 01:14:23,582
- That may have been helping me.
- And now we're not!

1188
01:14:23,658 --> 01:14:26,252
So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.

1189
01:14:29,564 --> 01:14:34,297
All of you, let's get
behind this fellow! Move it out!

1190
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:36,064
Move out!

1191
01:14:43,945 --> 01:14:47,938
Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
you copy me with the wings of the plane!

1192
01:14:48,016 --> 01:14:49,040
Don't have to yell.

1193
01:14:49,117 --> 01:14:51,642
I'm not yelling!
We're in a lot of trouble.

1194
01:14:51,719 --> 01:14:55,314
It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!

1195
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:58,223
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!

1196
01:15:09,103 --> 01:15:10,229
I can't do this!

1197
01:15:10,305 --> 01:15:13,832
Vanessa, pull yourself together.
You have to snap out of it!

1198
01:15:13,908 --> 01:15:15,102
You snap out of it.

1199
01:15:15,176 --> 01:15:16,268
You snap out of it.

1200
01:15:16,344 --> 01:15:18,608
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

1201
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,240
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

1202
01:15:41,369 --> 01:15:43,667
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

1203
01:15:43,738 --> 01:15:46,332
- Hold it!
- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.

1204
01:15:46,407 --> 01:15:48,534
How is the plane flying?

1205
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:49,770
I don't know.

1206
01:15:50,612 --> 01:15:51,636
Hello?

1207
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:54,705
Benson, got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?

1208
01:15:54,782 --> 01:15:56,215
The Pollen Jocks!

1209
01:15:56,284 --> 01:15:57,911
They do get behind a fellow.

1210
01:15:57,986 --> 01:16:00,420
- Black and yellow.
- Hello.

1211
01:16:00,488 --> 01:16:03,480
All right, let's drop this tin can
on the blacktop.

1212
01:16:03,558 --> 01:16:06,049
Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?

1213
01:16:06,127 --> 01:16:08,425
No, nothing. It's all cloudy.

1214
01:16:08,496 --> 01:16:10,726
Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.

1215
01:16:10,798 --> 01:16:12,891
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

1216
01:16:12,967 --> 01:16:16,266
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

1217
01:16:16,337 --> 01:16:19,170
Wait a minute.
I think I'm feeling something.

1218
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,868
- What?
- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.

1219
01:16:21,943 --> 01:16:24,275
Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.

1220
01:16:24,345 --> 01:16:25,642
Bring the nose down.

1221
01:16:28,583 --> 01:16:32,075
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

1222
01:16:32,153 --> 01:16:36,249
- What in the world is on the tarmac?
- Get some lights on that!

1223
01:16:36,324 --> 01:16:40,192
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

1224
01:16:40,261 --> 01:16:42,593
- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
- OK.

1225
01:16:42,664 --> 01:16:46,794
Out the engines. We're going in
on bee power. Ready, boys?

1226
01:16:46,868 --> 01:16:47,892
Affirmative!

1227
01:16:50,838 --> 01:16:53,363
Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.

1228
01:16:53,441 --> 01:16:55,102
Land on that flower!

1229
01:16:55,176 --> 01:16:56,768
Ready? Full reverse!

1230
01:16:56,844 --> 01:16:58,004
Spin it around!

1231
01:17:01,215 --> 01:17:03,240
- Not that flower! The other one!
- Which one?

1232
01:17:03,318 --> 01:17:05,684
- That flower.
- I'm aiming at the flower!

1233
01:17:05,753 --> 01:17:10,383
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant pulsating flower

1234
01:17:10,458 --> 01:17:13,291
made of millions of bees!

1235
01:17:13,361 --> 01:17:16,353
Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.

1236
01:17:17,031 --> 01:17:18,692
Rotate around it.

1237
01:17:19,233 --> 01:17:22,725
- This is insane, Barry!
- This's the only way I know how to fly.

1238
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:26,831
Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
flying in an insect-like pattern?

1239
01:17:26,908 --> 01:17:30,309
Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
Smell it. Full reverse!

1240
01:17:30,378 --> 01:17:32,437
Just drop it. Be a part of it.

1241
01:17:33,047 --> 01:17:35,015
Aim for the center!

1242
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:38,052
Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!

1243
01:17:48,329 --> 01:17:49,990
Oome on, already.

1244
01:17:54,802 --> 01:17:58,329
Barry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!

1245
01:17:58,406 --> 01:18:00,874
- Yes. No high-five!
- Right.

1246
01:18:00,942 --> 01:18:03,843
Barry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?

1247
01:18:03,911 --> 01:18:08,405
What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!

1248
01:18:08,483 --> 01:18:11,008
- Thank you.
- But we're not done yet.

1249
01:18:20,094 --> 01:18:21,220
Listen, everyone!

1250
01:18:21,295 --> 01:18:24,196
This runway is covered
with the last pollen

1251
01:18:24,265 --> 01:18:27,029
from the last flowers
available anywhere on Earth.

1252
01:18:27,101 --> 01:18:30,195
That means this is our last chance.

1253
01:18:30,271 --> 01:18:34,867
We're the only ones who make honey,
pollinate flowers and dress like this.

1254
01:18:34,942 --> 01:18:39,504
If we're gonna survive as a species,
this is our moment! What do you say?

1255
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:44,813
Are we going to be bees, orjust
Museum of Natural History keychains?

1256
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:46,444
We're bees!

1257
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:47,681
Keychain!

1258
01:18:47,755 --> 01:18:51,555
Then follow me! Except Keychain.

1259
01:18:51,626 --> 01:18:53,560
Hold on, Barry. Here.

1260
01:18:53,628 --> 01:18:55,118
You've earned this.

1261
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:03,698
Yeah!

1262
01:19:06,474 --> 01:19:11,468
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.

1263
01:19:15,316 --> 01:19:16,578
Oh, yeah.

1264
01:19:16,651 --> 01:19:18,881
That's our Barry.

1265
01:20:28,389 --> 01:20:30,220
Mom! The bees are back!

1266
01:20:43,404 --> 01:20:45,872
If anybody needs
to make a call, now's the time.

1267
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:48,408
I got a feeling we'll be
working late tonight!

1268
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:07,851
Here's your change. Have a great
afternoon! Oan I help who's next?

1269
01:21:07,929 --> 01:21:12,696
Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.

1270
01:21:12,767 --> 01:21:17,101
Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel!

1271
01:21:18,306 --> 01:21:21,070
Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!

1272
01:21:21,142 --> 01:21:22,404
I had no idea.

1273
01:21:22,476 --> 01:21:24,944
Barry, I'm sorry.
Have you got a moment?

1274
01:21:25,012 --> 01:21:28,209
Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.

1275
01:21:28,282 --> 01:21:29,476
Sorry I'm late.

1276
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:30,676
He's a lawyer too?

1277
01:21:30,751 --> 01:21:35,586
I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
All I needed was a briefcase.

1278
01:21:35,656 --> 01:21:37,487
Have a great afternoon!

1279
01:21:37,558 --> 01:21:41,756
Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
and I can't get them anywhere.

1280
01:21:41,829 --> 01:21:44,195
No problem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.

1281
01:21:44,265 --> 01:21:47,063
You're a lifesaver, Barry.
Oan I help who's next?

1282
01:21:47,134 --> 01:21:50,262
All right, scramble, jocks!
It's time to fly.

1283
01:21:50,338 --> 01:21:52,135
Thank you, Barry!

1284
01:21:54,809 --> 01:21:57,175
That bee is living my life!

1285
01:21:57,244 --> 01:21:58,370
Let it go, Kenny.

1286
01:21:58,446 --> 01:22:01,040
- When will this nightmare end?!
- Let it all go.

1287
01:22:07,154 --> 01:22:09,588
- Beautiful day to fly.
- Sure is.

1288
01:22:09,657 --> 01:22:13,423
Between you and me,
I was dying to get out of that office.

1289
01:29:42,609 --> 01:29:45,442
You have got
to start thinking bee, my friend.

1290
01:29:45,512 --> 01:29:47,309
- Thinking bee!
- Me?

1291
01:30:21,982 --> 01:30:24,746
Hold it. Let's just stop
for a second. Hold it.

1292
01:30:24,818 --> 01:30:28,413
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
Oan we stop here?

1293
01:30:28,489 --> 01:30:31,925
I'm not making a major life decision
during a production number!

1294
01:30:31,992 --> 01:30:35,086
All right. Take ten, everybody.
Wrap it up, guys.

1295
01:30:35,162 --> 01:30:37,289
I had virtually no rehearsal for that.
