<i>Who would dare set foot

9
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:11,070
<i>Why, our subject today,
Charles Muntz!</i>

10
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,823
<i>The beloved explorer lands
his dirigible the Spirit of Adventure,</i>

11
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,324
<i>in New Hampshire this week,</i>

12
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,869
<i>completing a yearlong expedition
to the lost world.</i>

13
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,497
<i>This lighter-than-air craft
was designed by Muntz himself</i>

14
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:25,835
<i>and is longer than 22 prohibition
paddy wagons placed end to end.</i>

15
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,713
<i>And here comes the adventurer now.</i>

16
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:30,548
<i>Never apart from his faithful dogs,</i>

17
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:33,009
<i>Muntz conceived the craft
for canine comfort.</i>

18
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,094
<i>It's a veritable floating palace
in the sky,</i>

19
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:39,056
<i>complete with doggy bath
and mechanical canine walker.</i>

20

<i>And, Jiminy Cricket do the locals
consider Muntz the bee's knees.</i>

21
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,687
<i>And how!</i>

22
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:47,231
<i>Adventure is out there!</i>

23
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,527
<i>But what has Muntz
brought back this time?</i>

24
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,602
<i>Gentlemen, I give you</i>

25
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:56,782
<i>the monster of Paradise Falls!</i>

26
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,704
<i>And, golly, what a swell monster this is!</i>

27
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,123
<i>But what's this? Scientists cry foul.</i>

28
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,375
<i>The National Explorer's Society
accuses Muntz</i>

29
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,211
<i>of fabricating the skeleton.</i>

30
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:09,712
No!

31
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,255
<i>The organization strips Muntz</i>

32
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,965
<i>of his membership.</i>

33
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:18,221
<i>Humiliated, Muntz vows

<i>and promises
to capture the beast alive!</i>

35
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:24,435
<i>I promise to capture the beast alive,</i>

36
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,230
<i>and I will not come back until I do!</i>

37

<i>And so, the explorer's off

<i>piloting his famous dirigible.</i>

43

<i>He hurdles the Grand Canyon.</i>

45

<i>He hurdles Mount Everest.</i>

46
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,102
<i>He goes around Mount Everest.</i>

47
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,022
<i>Is there nothing he cannot do?</i>

48
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,985
<i>Yes, as Muntz himself says,
"Adventure is..."</i>

49

Adventure is out there!
Look out!

Mount Rushmore! Hard to starboard!

51
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:24,537
Must get Spirit of Adventure
over Mount Rushmore!

52
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:29,124
Hold together, old girl.
How're my dogs doing?

53
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:36,382
All engines, ahead full!
Let's take her up to 26,000 feet.

Rudders 18 degrees towards the south.

Winds out of the east at 10 knots.

Visibility unlimited.
Enter the weather in the logbook.

57
00:03:48,586 --> 00:03:52,314
There's something down there.
I will bring it back for science.

58
00:03:53,382 --> 00:03:58,696
It's a puppy! No time!
A storm! Lightning. Hail.

59
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,456
What are you doing?

60
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:03,242
Don't you know
this is an exclusive club?

61
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,286
Only explorers get in here,

62
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:09,373
not just any kid off the street
with a helmet and a pair of goggles.

63
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,709
Do you think you've got what it takes?
Well, do you?

64
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,547
All right, you're in. Welcome aboard.

65
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:20,551
What's wrong? Can't you talk?

66
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:25,055
Hey, I don't bite.

67
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,937
You and me, we're in a club now.

68
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:39,778
I saw where your balloon went.
Come on. Let's go get it.

69
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,739
My name's Ellie.

70
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,411
There it is.

71
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,500
Well, go ahead.

72
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,923
Go on.

73
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,821
Hey, kid!

74
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,741
Thought you might need
a little cheering up.

75
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,076
I got something to show you.

76
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,373
I am about to let you
see something

77
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,584
I have never shown
to another human being.

78
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,086
Ever! In my life!

79
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:42,382
You'll have to swear
you will not tell anyone.

80
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,761
Cross your heart. Do it!

81
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,682
My Adventure Book.

82
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,977
You know him.

83
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,314
Charles Muntz, explorer.

84
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,859
When I get big,
I'm going where he's going,

85
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:06,531
South America.
It's like America, but south.

86
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,201
Want to know where I'm goanna live?

87
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:14,164
"Paradise Falls, a land lost in time."

88
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,543
I ripped this right out of a library book.

89
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:23,298
I'm goanna move my clubhouse there
and park it right next to the falls.

90
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,009
Who knows what lives up there.

91
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,803
And once I get there?

92
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:32,265
Well, I'm saving these pages for
all the adventures I'm goanna have.

93
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:38,230
Only I just don't know how
I'm goanna get to Paradise Falls.

94
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:48,031
That's it!
You can take us there in a blimp!

95
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:51,035
Swear you'll take us! Cross your heart!

96
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:56,206
Cross it! Cross your heart!
Good, you promised. No backing out.

97
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,751
Well, see you tomorrow, kid. Bye!

98
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,839
Adventure is out there!

99
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,676
You know, you don't talk very much.

100
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,886
I like you!

101
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,693
Stevie, throw me a deuce!

102
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,906
Quite a sight, Ellie?

103
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,745
Mail's here.

104
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:08,054
Shady Oaks Retirement.
Brother.

105
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:20,442
Hey! Morning, Mr. Frederickson.
Need any help there?

106
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,319
No. Yes!

107
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,281
Tell your boss over there
that you boys are ruining our house.

108
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,908
Well, just to let you know,

109
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,577
my boss will be happy to take
this old place off your hands,

110
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,163
and for double his last offer!

111
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,747
What do you say to that?

112
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,960
I take that as a "no," then?

113
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:42,506
I believe I made my position
to your boss quite clear.

114
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:45,008
You poured prune juice in his gas tank.

115
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,678
Yeah, that was good.
Here, let me talk to him.

116
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,902
You in the suit. Yes, you.

117
00:14:54,105 --> 00:14:56,352
Take a bath, hippie!

118
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,688
I am not with him!

119
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:02,525
This is serious!
He's out to get your house.

120
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,529
Tell your boss
he can have our house.

121
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,156
- Really?
- When I'm dead!

122
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,993
I'll take that as a maybe.

123
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,954
Order now, you get the camera,

124
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:17,207
you get the printer, 4x optical zoom,

125
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,209
Schneider lens, photo printer, SD card.

126
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,968
"Good afternoon. My name is Russell.

127
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:33,390
"And I am a Wilderness Explorer
in Tribe 54, Sweat Lodge 12.

128
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:36,226
"Are you in need
of any assistance today, sir?"

129
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:37,352
No.

130
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:40,730
- I could help you cross the street.
- No.

131
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:44,693
- I could help you cross your yard.
- No.

132
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:48,697
- I could help you cross your porch.
- No.

133
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,866
Well, I got to help you cross something.

134
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,368
No. I'm doing fine.

135
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,168
"Good afternoon. My name is Russell."

136
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,379
- Kid... Kid.
- "And I am a Wilderness Explorer

137
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:09,050
- "in Tribe 54, Sweat Lodge 12."
- I... Slow down. Kid!

138
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,011
- "Are you in need of any assistance..."
- Thank you,

139
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,012
- but I don't need any help!
- "...today, sir?"

140
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,562
Proceed.

141
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,941
- "Good afternoon..."
- But skip to the end!

142
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:29,862
See these? These are
my Wilderness Explorer badges.

143
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,051
You may notice one is missing.

144
00:16:32,164 --> 00:16:34,951
It's my Assisting the Elderly badge.

145
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:39,789
If I get it, I will become
a Senior Wilderness Explorer.

146
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,208
"The wilderness must be explored!"

147
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:48,256
It's goanna be great!
There's a big ceremony,

148
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,801
and all the dads come,
and they pin on our badges.

149
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,887
So, you want to assist an old person?

150
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:57,765
Yep! Then I'll be
a Senior Wilderness Explorer.

151
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,937
- You ever heard of a snipe?
- Snipe?

152
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,772
Bird. Beady eyes.

153
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:08,276
Every night it sneaks in my yard
and gobbles my poor azaleas.

154
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,657
I'm elderly and infirm.
I can't catch it.

155
00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:13,657
If only someone could help me.

156
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:17,410
- Me, me! I'll do it!
- I don't know. It's awfully crafty.

157
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,246
You'd have to clap your hands
3 times to lure it in.

158
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,123
I'll find him, Mr. Frederickson!

159
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,584
I think its burrow is 2 blocks down.
If you go past...

160
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:28,129
2 blocks down. Got it! Snipe.

161
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,632
Here, snipey, snipey.

162
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,425
Bring it back here when you find it.

163
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,593
Snipe!

164
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,178
Okay, keep her coming.
Keep coming.

165
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,308
And stop. Stop. Stop!

166
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,646
Why... Hey! Hey, you!

167
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,189
What do you...
What do you think you're doing?

168
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,775
- I am so sorry, sir.
- Don't touch that!

169
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,360
No, no, no.
Let me take care of that for you.

170
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,529
- Get away from our mailbox!
- Hey. Sir, I...

171
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,530
I don't want you to touch it!

172
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,503
Steve, you all right?

173
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,705
Sorry, Mr. Frederickson.

174
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:49,043
You don't seem like
a public menace to me. Take this.

175
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:53,214
The guys from Shady Oaks will be by
to pick you up in the morning, okay?

176
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,522
What do I do now, Ellie?

177
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,530
Morning, gentlemen.

178
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:43,991
Good morning, Mr. Frederickson.
You ready to go?

179
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,828
Ready as I'll ever be.

180
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:49,205
Would you do me a favour
and take this?

181
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,666
I'll meet you at the van in just a minute.

182
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:56,462
I want to say one last goodbye
to the old place.

183
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:59,340
Sure. Take all the time you need, sir.

184
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:05,513
That's typical. He's probably
going to the bathroom for the 80th time.

185
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:09,684
You think he'd take better
care of his house.

186
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:55,980
So long, boys! I'll send you a postcard
from Paradise Falls!

187
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,737
We're on our way, Ellie.

188
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:39,477
Hi, Mr. Frederickson. It's me, Russell.

189
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,562
What are you doing out here, kid?

190
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:45,400
I found the snipe
and I followed it under your porch,

191
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:50,738
but this snipe had a long tail
and looked more like a large mouse.

192
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,245
Please let me in.

193
00:24:58,247 --> 00:24:59,914
No.

194
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:06,670
Alright, you can come...

195
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:21,101
I've never been
in a floating house before.

196
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:24,906
Goggles. Look at this stuff.

197
00:25:25,104 --> 00:25:26,566
You're going on a trip?

198
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:30,111
"Paradise Falls, a land lost in time."

199
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,946
You're going to South America,
Mr. Frederickson?

200
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,906
Don't touch that! You'll soil it.

201
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,033
You know, most people take a plane,

202
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:39,454
but you're smart because you will
have all your TV and clocks and stuff.

203
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:42,457
Is this how you steer your house?

204
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,375
Does it really work?

205
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,461
Kid, would you stop with the...

206
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,129
- This makes it go right.
- Let go of that...

207
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,798
- And that way's left.
- Knock it off!

208
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,258
Hey, look! Buildings.

209
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:57,262
That building's so close
I could almost touch it.

210
00:26:00,575 --> 00:26:02,477
This is great!

211
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:04,770
You should try this, Mr. Frederickson.

212
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:08,232
Look, there's a bus that could
take me home 2 blocks away!

213
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,276
Hey! I can see your house from here.

214
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,854
Don't jerk around so much, kid.

215
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,492
Well, that's not goanna work.

216
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,745
I know that cloud. It's a cumulonimbus.

217
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,246
Did you know that

218
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,081
the cumulonimbus forms

219
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,291
when warm air rises over cool air?

220
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,669
Stayed up all night
blowing up balloons... for what?

221
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,837
and that's how we get lightning.

222
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,755
- That's nice, kid.
- Mr. Frederickson?

223
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,634
There's a storm coming.
It's starting to get scary.

224
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:38,762
We're goanna get blown to bits!
We're in big trouble...

225
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,683
- What are you doing over there?
- Look.

226
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,488
See? Cumulonimbus.

227
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,567
My pack!

228
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,740
Got ya!

229
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,737
I thought you were dead.

230
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,450
What happened?

231
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:25,953
I steered us. I did. I steered the house.

232
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,121
Steered us?

233
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,957
After you tied your stuff down,
you took a nap.

234
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,543
So I went ahead
and steered us down here.

235
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,336
Yeah. Sure.

236
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,934
Can't tell where we are.

237
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,978
We're in South America, all right.

238
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:54,940
It was a cinch
with my Wilderness Explorer GPS.

239
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,485
- GP... What?
- My dad gave it to me.

240
00:28:57,486 --> 00:29:00,320
It shows exactly where we are
on the planet.

241
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:05,159
With this baby, we'll never be lost!

242
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,335
We'll get you down, find a bus stop,

243
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:17,505
you just tell the man
you want to go back to your mother.

244
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:21,675
Sure, but I don't think
they have buses in Paradise Falls.

245
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,764
There. That ought to do it.

246
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,683
Here, I'll give you
some change for bus fare.

247
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:31,685
No, I'll just use my city bus pass.

248
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,022
That's goanna be like a billion transfers

249
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,191
to get back to my house.

250
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:46,200
Mr. Frederickson, how much longer?

251
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:50,537
Well, we're up pretty high.
Could take hours to get down.

252
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:54,958
That thing was... building or something.

253
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,045
What was that, Mr. Frederickson?

254
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,881
We can't be close to the ground yet.

255
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,726
Wait! Wait, no, don't! Don't, don't!

256
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,520
Wait, wait. Wait!

257
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,995
Russell, hang on! Hey!

258
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:34,999
- Walk back. Walk back.
- Okay.

259
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,334
Come on. Come on.

260
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,600
Where... Where are we?

261
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:57,604
This doesn't look like the city
or the jungle, Mr. Frederickson.

262
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,442
Don't worry, Ellie. I got it.

263
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,261
There it is.

264
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,833
Ellie, it's so beautiful.

265
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,337
We made it.

266
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:08,175
We made it! Russell! We could float
right over there! Climb up. Climb up!

267
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,677
You mean, assist you?

268
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:12,429
- Yeah, yeah. Whatever.
- Okay. I'll climb up.

269
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:20,187
- Watch it!
- Sorry.

270
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:31,656
Now, when you get up there,
go ahead and hoist me up!

271
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,992
Got it?

272
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,790
You on the porch yet?

273
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,173
What? That's it?

274
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:53,887
I came all this way just to get stuck
at the wrong end of this rock pile?

275
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,640
Great.

276
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:03,209
Hey, if I could assist you over there,

277
00:33:03,401 --> 00:33:05,399
would you sign off on my badge?

278
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,407
What are you talking about?

279
00:33:07,501 --> 00:33:09,937
We could walk your house to the falls.

280
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:13,908
- Walk it?
- Yeah! After all, we weigh it down.

281
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:17,744
We could walk it right over there.
Like a parade balloon.

282
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:24,919
Now, we're goanna walk to
the falls quickly and quietly

283
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,546
with no rap music or flash dancing.

284
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:32,551
We have 3 days, at best, before
the helium leaks out of those balloons.

285
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:35,095
And if we're not at the falls
when that happens...

286
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,514
- Sand.
...we're not getting to the falls.

287
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,891
I found sand!

288
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:44,438
Don't you worry, Ellie.
We'll get our house over there.

289
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,278
This is fun already, isn't it?

290
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,407
By the time we get there,
you're goanna feel so assisted.

291
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:58,744
Mr. Frederickson,
if we happen to get separated,

292
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,955
use the Wilderness Explorer call.

293
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,961
Wait. Why are we going
to Paradise Falls again?

294
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,129
Hey, let's play a game.

295
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:12,466
It's called
"see who can be quiet the longest."

296
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,802
Cool! My mom loves that game!

297
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,658
Darn thing!

298
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,953
Come on, Russell.
Would you hurry it up?

299
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:27,458
I'm tired. And my knee hurts.

300
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:29,334
Which knee?

301
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:34,006
My elbow hurts,
and I have to go to the bathroom.

302
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:36,842
I asked you about that 5 minutes ago.

303
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:40,512
Well, I didn't have to go then!

304
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:46,560
I don't want to walk anymore.
Can we stop?

305
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,730
Russell, if you don't hurry up,
the tigers will eat you.

306
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:54,693
There are no tigers in South America.
Zoology.

307
00:35:56,137 --> 00:35:59,573
For the love of Pete! Go on into
the bushes and do your business.

308
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,242
Okay! Here! Hold my stuff.

309
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,871
I've always wanted to try this.

310
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,668
Mr. Frederickson,

311
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:15,171
am I supposed to dig the hole
before or after?

312
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,841
None of my concern!

313
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:21,428
It's before!

314
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,854
Tracks?

315
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,189
Snipe.

316
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:38,737
Here, snipe. Come on out, snipe.

317
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,531
Snipe.

318
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,637
Gotcha! Don't be afraid, little snipe.

319
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,408
I am a Wilderness Explorer,

320
00:37:05,638 --> 00:37:08,808
so I'm a friend to all of nature.

321
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,102
Want some more?

322
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:17,776
Hi, boy. Don't eat it all. Come on out.

323
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:24,324
Come on. Come on.
Don't be afraid, little snipe.

324
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:29,079
Nice snipe. Good little snipe. Nice...

325
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:32,082
Giant snipe.

326
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:39,590
- I found the snipe!
- Did you?

327
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,634
- Are they tall?
- Yes, they're very tall.

328
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:45,762
- Do they have a lot of colours?
- They do, indeed!

329
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:49,599
- Do they like chocolate?
- Yes... chocolate?

330
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,771
- What is that thing?
- It's a snipe!

331
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,857
There's no such thing as a snipe!

332
00:37:56,858 --> 00:38:00,110
- But you said snipes eat your...
- Hey!

333
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,197
Go on! Get out of here! Go on!

334
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,834
Careful, Russell!

335
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:19,613
Hey, look, Mr. Frederickson.
It likes me.

336
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:23,550
- Russell!
- No, stop! That tickles.

337
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,803
Get out of here! Go on! Get!

338
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,709
No, no, no! Kevin! It's okay.

339
00:38:36,911 --> 00:38:38,899
Mr. Frederickson is nice.

340
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,235
- Kevin?
- Yeah. That's his name I just gave him.

341
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:47,574
Beat it! Vamoose! Scram!
Hey! That's mine!

342
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,080
Get out of here!

343
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,833
Go on! Beat it!

344
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:03,006
Can we keep him? Please?

345
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:07,010
I'll get the food for him. I'll walk him.
I'll change his newspapers.

346
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,595
No.

347
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:13,767
"An Explorer is a friend to all,
be it plants or fish or tiny mole."

348
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,770
- That doesn't even rhyme.
- Yeah, it does.

349
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,773
- Hey, look. Kevin.
- What?

350
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:23,943
Get down! You're not allowed up there!

351
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,782
You come down here right now!

352
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,746
Can you believe this, Ellie?

353
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,289
Ellie?

354
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:40,043
Hey, Ellie! Could I keep the bird?

355
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,965
She said for you to let me.

356
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,534
But I told him no. I told you no!

357
00:39:47,835 --> 00:39:49,102
N-O.

358
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,982
I see you back there.

359
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:08,405
Go on! Get out of here!
Go annoy someone else for a while.

360
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,490
Hey, are you okay over there?

361
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,746
Hello?

362
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,504
Hello, sir! Thank goodness.

363
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:27,007
It's nice to know
someone else is up here.

364
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:29,300
I can smell you.

365
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:33,012
What? You can smell us?

366
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,474
I can smell you.

367
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,441
Hey.

368
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,360
You were talking to a rock.

369
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,113
Hey, that one looks like a turtle.

370
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:53,616
Look at that one!
That one looks like a dog.

371
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:57,036
- It is a dog!
- What?

372
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:01,040
We're not allowed to have dogs
in my apartment.

373
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,336
Hey, I like dogs.

374
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:06,462
We have your dog!

375
00:41:06,681 --> 00:41:08,507
Wonder who he belongs to.

376
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:09,552
Sit, boy.

377
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:12,552
Hey, look, he's trained. Shake.

378
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,054
- Speak.
- Hi, there.

379
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,683
Did that dog just say "Hi, there"?

380
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,351
Yes.

381
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:24,480
My name is Dug.
I have just met you, and I love you.

382
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:28,527
My master made me this collar.
He is a good and smart master,

383
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:32,530
and he made me this collar
so that I may talk. Squirrel!

384
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,367
My master is good and smart.

385
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:36,535
It's not possible.

386
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:39,079
It is, because my master is smart.

387
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,581
- Cool! What do these do, boy?
- Hey, would you...

388
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,917
I use that collar...

389
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,045
to talk with.
I would be happy if you stopped.

390
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:50,549
Russell, don't touch that!
It could be radioactive or something!

391
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,925
I am a great tracker.

392
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:55,095
My pack sent me on a special mission
all by myself.

393
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:56,263
Have you seen a bird?

394
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:58,598
I want to find one,
and I've been on the scent.

395
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:01,267
I am a great tracker.
Did I mention that?

396
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,728
Hey, that is the bird.

397
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:06,731
I have never seen one up close,
but this is the bird.

398
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:09,276
May I take your bird back to camp
as my prisoner?

399
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:13,405
Yes, yes, take it. And on the way,
learn how to bark like a real dog.

400
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:14,948
I can bark.

401
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,283
And here's howling.

402
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,623
Can we keep him?
Please, please, please!

403
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:26,918
- No.
- But it's a talking dog!

404
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:30,589
It's just a weird trick or something.
Let's get to the falls.

405
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,382
Please be my prisoner.

406
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:35,134
Oh, please, oh, please be my prisoner!

407
00:42:37,705 --> 00:42:40,724
Here it is.
I picked up the bird's scent!

408
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:43,393
Wait a minute! What is this?

409
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,103
Chocolate. I smell chocolate.

410
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:48,306
I'm getting prunes
and denture cream!

411
00:42:48,404 --> 00:42:49,866
Who are they?

412
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,110
Man, Master will not be pleased.

413
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:55,613
We better tell him someone
took the bird. Right, Alpha?

414
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:57,991
No.

415
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:01,327
Soon enough the bird
will be ours yet again.

416
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,079
Find the scent, my compares,

417
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,956
and you too shall
have much rewordings

418
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:08,167
from Master for the toil factor
you wage.

419
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:11,505
Hey, Alpha, I think there's
something wrong with your collar.

420
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:12,839
You must've bumped it.

421
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,633
Yeah, your voice sounds funny!

422
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:23,516
Beta! Gamma!
Mayhaps you desire to... Squirrel!

423
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,187
Mayhaps you desire
to challenge the ranking

424
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,856
that I have been assigned
by my strength and cunning.

425
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:34,152
No, no. But maybe Dug would.
You might want to ask him.

426
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:39,658
Yeah. I wonder if he's found
the bird on his very special mission.

427
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:42,077
Do not mention Dug
to me at this time.

428
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:47,582
His fool's errand will keep him
most occupied. Most occupied indeed.

429
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:52,295
Do you not agree with that
which I am saying to you now?

430
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:56,675
Sure, but the second Master
finds out you sent Dug out by himself,

431
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:58,760
none of us will get a treat.

432
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:01,971
You are wise, my trusted lieutenant.

433
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:06,184
This is Alpha calling Dug.
Come in, Dug.

434
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,853
Hi, Alpha. Hey, your voice sounds funny.

435
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:12,023
I know, I know!
Have you seen the bird?

436
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:14,859
Why, yes. The bird is my prisoner now.

437
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,819
Yeah, right!

438
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,198
Impossible! Where are you?

439
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,700
I am here with the bird,

440
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:24,536
and I will bring it back,
and then you will like me.

441
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:27,038
- Got to go.
- Hey, Dug, who you talking to?

442
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,040
- No, wait, wait!
- What's Dug doing?

443
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,959
Why's he with that small mailman?

444
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,086
Where are they?

445
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:37,465
There he is. Come on!

446
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:44,389
Oh, please... be my prisoner.

447
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,890
Dug, stop bothering Kevin!

448
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:48,309
That man there says
I can take the bird,

449
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,729
and I love that man there
like he is my master.

450
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,896
I am not your master!

451
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:53,523
I am warning you once again, bird.

452
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,609
- Hey! Quit it!
- I am jumping on you now, bird.

453
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,986
Russell, at this rate,
we'll never get to the falls.

454
00:44:57,987 --> 00:44:59,821
Here, bird.

455
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:09,289
I am nobody's master, got it?

456
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,833
I don't want you here,
and I don't want you here!

457
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,209
I'm stuck with you!

458
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,962
And if you two don't clear out of here
by the time I count to 3...

459
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,840
A ball! Oh, boy! A ball!

460
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:22,510
Ball? Yeah, yeah? You want it, boy?

461
00:45:22,878 --> 00:45:24,054
Yeah. Yeah?

462
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:26,181
Yes, I do!
I do ever so want the ball.

463
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:27,724
- Go get it!
- Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

464
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,643
I will get it and then bring it back!

465
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:31,269
Quick, Russell.
Give me some chocolate.

466
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,772
- Why?
- Just give it to me!

467
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:35,648
Bird. Bird!

468
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:39,653
Come on, Russell.

469
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:42,530
Wait. Wait, Mr. Frederickson.

470
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,453
What are we doing?

471
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,401
Hey, we're pretty far now.

472
00:45:56,601 --> 00:45:58,671
Kevin's goanna miss me.

473
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,304
I think that did the trick.

474
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:09,557
Hi, Master.

475
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,726
Afternoon.

476
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:40,004
Well, thanks for keeping us
dry anyway, Ellie.

477
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:42,381
Which one's the front?

478
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:44,843
Oh, boy.

479
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:49,055
Is this step 3 or step 5?

480
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,600
There.

481
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,898
All done! That's for you.

482
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,907
Tents are hard.

483
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,804
Wait. Aren't you super wilderness guy,

484
00:47:10,942 --> 00:47:13,704
with the GPMs and the badges?

485
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:18,501
Yeah, but can I tell you a secret?

486
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:21,921
- No.
- All right. Here it goes.

487
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:25,967
I never actually built a tent before.
There, I said it.

488
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:28,261
You've been camping before,
haven't you?

489
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:31,222
Well, never outside.

490
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:35,101
Well, why didn't you ask your dad
how to build a tent?

491
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:38,021
I don't think he wants
to talk about this stuff.

492
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:40,732
Well, why don't you try him sometime.
Maybe he'll surprise you.

493
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:43,151
Well, he's away a lot.
I don't see him much.

494
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:44,861
He's got to be home sometime.

495
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:49,199
Well, I call, but Phyllis told me
I bug him too much.

496
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,077
Phyllis? You call your own mother
by her first name?

497
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:55,371
Phyllis isn't my mom.

498
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:09,511
But he promised
he'd come to my Explorer ceremony

499
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:12,805
to pin on
my Assisting the Elderly badge.

500
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,018
So, he can show me
about tents then, right?

501
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,985
Hey, why don't you get some sleep?

502
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:30,114
Don't want to wake up
the travelling flea circus.

503
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:33,243
Mr. Frederickson?

504
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:36,620
Dug says he wants
to take Kevin prisoner.

505
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:39,457
We have to protect him.

506
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,711
Can Kevin go with us?

507
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:47,256
All right, he can come.

508
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:50,051
Promise you won't leave him?

509
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,678
- Yeah.
- Cross your heart?

510
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,772
Cross my heart.

511
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,821
What have I got myself into, Ellie?

512
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,763
Morning, sweetheart.

513
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:39,517
We better get moving.

514
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:43,146
Bird's gone.

515
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:47,233
Maybe Russell won't notice.
All right, everybody up!

516
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:52,113
Where's Kevin? He's wandered off!
Kevin! Dug, find Kevin!

517
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:56,034
Find the bird, find the bird!
Hi, hi. Point!

518
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:58,411
Look. There he is!

519
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:01,873
Point!

520
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:05,627
Hey! That's my food! Get off my roof!

521
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:07,378
Yeah, get off of his...

522
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:13,635
What is it doing?

523
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:16,554
The bird is calling to her babies.

524
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:19,140
Her babies.

525
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,059
Kevin's a girl?

526
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:27,189
Her house is over there
in those twisty rocks.

527
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:31,861
She has been gathering food for
her babies and must get back to them.

528
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:34,780
Wait. Kevin's just leaving?

529
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:39,452
But you promised to protect her.

530
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:42,830
Her babies need her.
We got to make sure they're together!

531
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:46,375
Sorry, Russell.
We've lost enough time already.

532
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:48,961
Yeah.

533
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:59,346
This was her favourite chocolate.

534
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:04,018
Because you sent her away,
there's more for you.

535
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,980
Kevin?

536
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:29,168
Where's the bird?
You said you had the bird.

537
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,461
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

538
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:33,589
Since I have said that,
I can see how you would think that.

539
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,759
- Where is it?
- Tomorrow.

540
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:41,138
Come back tomorrow, and then
I will again have the bird. Yes.

541
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:46,060
You lost it! Why do I not
have a surprised feeling?

542
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:49,439
Well, at least you now have led us
to the small mailman

543
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,441
and the one who smells of prunes.

544
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,195
Master will be most pleased
we have found them

545
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:59,198
and will ask of them many questions.
Come!

546
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:03,244
Wait. We're not going with you!
We're going to the falls!

547
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,872
Get away from me!

548
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:12,002
Get down!

549
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,433
Stay!

550
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:18,235
You came here in that?

551
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:19,987
Yeah.

552
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:24,575
In a house? A floating house?

553
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:35,919
That is the darnedest thing
I've ever seen.

554
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:38,965
You're not after my bird, are you?

555
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:41,592
But if you needed to borrow
a cup of sugar,

556
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:44,345
I'd be happy to oblige.

557
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:50,268
Well, this is all a misunderstanding.

558
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:52,603
My dogs made a mistake.

559
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:55,189
Wait. Are you Charles Muntz?

560
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,900
Yeah, well, yes.

561
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,403
THE Charles Muntz?

562
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:02,405
"Adventure is out there!"

563
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:06,242
It's really him! That's Charles Muntz!

564
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:09,704
- It is? Who's Charles Muntz?
- Him!

565
00:54:09,705 --> 00:54:11,622
- Yes! Yes! That's him!
- I'm Carl Frederickson.

566
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:14,542
My wife and I,
we were your biggest fans.

567
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:16,794
Well. You're a man of good taste.

568
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:21,298
Now, you must be tired. Hungry?

569
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:23,551
Now, attention, everyone!

570
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:27,888
These people are no longer intruders!
They are our guests.

571
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,059
Follow me. I like you temporarily.

572
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,269
You do smell like prunes.

573
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:37,732
I will not bite you.

574
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:40,693
The small mailman smells like chocolate.

575
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:43,696
I'm sorry about the dogs.

576
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:46,782
- Hope they weren't too rough on you.
- We weren't.

577
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:50,744
Go ahead and moor
your airship right next to mine.

578
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:59,962
We're not actually going inside
the Spirit of Adventure itself?

579
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,506
Would you like to?

580
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:04,258
Would I?

581
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:08,262
Wait up, Mr. Muntz.

582
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:10,473
Jiminy Cricket.

583
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:12,600
- Not you.
- What do we do with Dug?

584
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:16,854
He has lost the bird.
Put him in the Cone of Shame.

585
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,153
I do not like the Cone of Shame.

586
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:29,367
Well, most of the collection
is housed in the world's top museums,

587
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:33,496
New York, Munich, London.
Of course, I kept the best for myself.

588
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:36,415
Did you ever! Will you look at that?

589
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:39,001
Oh, yes, the Arsinoitherium.

590
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:41,796
Beast charged
while I was brushing my teeth.

591
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:44,632
Used my shaving kit to bring him down.

592
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:46,425
Yeah. Well, surprise me.

593
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,928
Only way to get it out
of Ethiopia at the time

594
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:52,306
was to have it declared
as dental equipment.

595
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:55,768
My gosh!
The giant Somalian leopard tortoise!

596
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:58,980
You recognize it. I'm impressed.

597
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:01,440
That's an interesting story there.

598
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,234
Excellent choice.

599
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:07,113
I found it on safari with Roosevelt.

600
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:11,075
He and I fell into a habit
of playing gin rummy in the evenings,

601
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:13,410
and did he cheat!

602
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:15,746
He was horrible.

603
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,833
Master, dinner is ready.

604
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:21,043
Oh, dear. Broken translator.

605
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:25,715
It's that loose wire again.
There you go, big fella.

606
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:27,174
Thank you, Master.

607
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,885
I liked his other voice.

608
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:34,389
Well, dinner is served. Right this way.

609
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:38,269
So, how are things stateside?

610
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:41,188
Almost tempted to go back a few times,

611
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:44,442
but I have unfinished work here.

612
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:47,528
Please. I hope you're hungry,

613
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:52,324
because Epsilon is the finest chef
I've ever had.

614
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:59,707
Epsilon, you've done it again!

615
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:01,250
Yes!

616
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:04,795
Hey! Hey!

617
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:07,840
My Ellie would've loved all this.

618
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,384
You know, it's because of you
she had this dream

619
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:13,137
to come down here
and live by Paradise Falls.

620
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,765
I'm honoured. And now you've made it.

621
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:18,309
You're sure we're not a bother?
I'd hate to impose.

622
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:22,438
No, no. It's a pleasure to have guests,
a real treat.

623
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,356
- Treat! Where's the treat!
- Treat!

624
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:27,068
No, no. Quiet!
Calm down, calm down.

625
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:28,569
- I want a treat! I want a treat!
- Hey!

626
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,237
I shouldn't have used that word.

627
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:33,074
Having guests is a delight.

628
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:37,036
More often I get thieves
come to steal what's rightfully mine.

629
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:38,579
No!

630
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:43,584
They called me a fraud, those...

631
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:50,090
But once I bring back this creature,
my name will be cleared.

632
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:52,968
Beautiful, isn't it?

633
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:58,307
I've spent a lifetime tracking it.

634
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:04,104
Sometimes years go by
between sightings.

635
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:09,651
I've tried to smoke it out of that
deathly labyrinth where it lives.

636
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,154
You can't go in after it.

637
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,865
Once in, there's no way out.

638
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:17,451
I've lost so many dogs.

639
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:24,625
And here they come, these bandits,
and think the bird is theirs to take.

640
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:30,339
But they soon find that this mountain
is a very dangerous place.

641
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:35,177
Hey, that looks like Kevin.

642
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:39,640
- Kevin?
- Yeah, that's my new giant bird pet.

643
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:41,809
I trained it to follow us.

644
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:45,479
Follow you? It's impossible. How?

645
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,357
- She likes chocolate.
- Chocolate?

646
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:52,027
Yeah. I gave her some of my chocolate.
She goes gaga for it.

647
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:55,447
But it ran off. It's gone now.

648
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:06,459
You know, Carl, these people
who pass through here,

649
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:09,544
they all tell pretty good stories.

650
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:14,508
A surveyor making a map.

651
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:18,637
A botanist cataloguing plants.

652
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:24,206
An old man taking his house

653
00:59:24,604 --> 00:59:27,396
to Paradise Falls.

654
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:38,073
I mean, that's the best one yet.
I can't wait to hear how it ends.

655
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:50,920
Well, it's been a wonderful evening,
but we better be going.

656
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:52,338
You're not leaving.

657
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:56,050
We don't want to take advantage
of your hospitality.

658
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:59,345
- Come on, Russell.
- But we haven't even had dessert yet.

659
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:02,598
The boy's right.
You haven't had dessert.

660
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:07,477
Epsilon here makes
a delicious cherries jubilee.

661
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:11,773
You really must stay. I insist.

662
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:14,776
We have so much more to talk about.

663
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:20,282
Kevin?

664
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:29,374
It's here.

665
01:00:31,086 --> 01:00:32,586
Get them!

666
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:37,758
- Hurry!
- I am hurrying!

667
01:00:37,942 --> 01:00:40,135
They're coming!

668
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:44,848
Master, over here.

669
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:02,657
Go toward the light, Master!

670
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:32,896
Russell!

671
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,819
Get back!

672
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:45,367
Go on, Master!
I will stop the dogs!

673
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:48,203
Stop, you dogs.

674
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:17,691
Help!

675
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:21,194
Help!

676
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:27,742
Give me your hand!

677
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,797
Hang on to Kevin!

678
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,747
Kevin.

679
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:41,399
No, no, no. Kevin. Stay down.

680
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:46,696
She's hurt real bad.
Can't we help her get home?

681
01:03:57,167 --> 01:04:00,252
All right, but we got to hurry.

682
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:07,968
You lost them?

683
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:09,219
No, it was Dug.

684
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:13,056
Yeah. He's with them.
He helped them escape!

685
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:15,309
Wait.

686
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:18,353
Wait a minute. Dug.

687
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:25,694
See anything?

688
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:29,448
No. My pack is not following us.
Boy, they are dumb.

689
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:30,783
This is crazy.

690
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:34,453
I finally meet my childhood hero,
and he's trying to kill us. What a joke!

691
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:35,954
Hey, I know a joke.

692
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:37,956
A squirrel walks up to a tree and says,

693
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:41,610
"I forgot to store acorns for winter
and now I am dead."

694
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:45,046
It is funny because
the squirrel gets dead.

695
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:49,968
Careful, Russell.

696
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:52,053
You okay, Kevin?

697
01:04:56,643 --> 01:04:58,977
You know what, Mr. Frederickson?

698
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:01,980
The wilderness isn't quite
what I expected.

699
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:03,899
Yeah? How so?

700
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,568
It's kind of wild.

701
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:09,988
I mean, it's not how they made it sound
in my book.

702
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:11,990
Get used to that, kid.

703
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:14,493
My dad made it sound so easy.

704
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:16,662
He's really good at camping

705
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:19,832
and how to make fire
from rocks and stuff.

706
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:23,043
He used to come to all
my Sweat Lodge meetings.

707
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:27,005
And afterwards,
we'd go get ice cream at Fentons.

708
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:29,842
I always get chocolate
and he gets butter prickle.

709
01:05:29,843 --> 01:05:32,886
Then we sit on this one curb
right outside,

710
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:36,849
and I'll count all the blue cars
and he counts all the red ones,

711
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:40,894
and whoever gets the most wins.

712
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:45,398
I like that curb.

713
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:50,403
That might sound boring,

714
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:54,949
but I think the boring stuff
is the stuff I remember the most.

715
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:04,292
Look! There it is!

716
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:08,463
Hey, kid. Hold on, Russell. Stand still.

717
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:22,644
Look at that bird go.
Wait up, you overgrown chicken.

718
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:27,399
That's it. Go, Kevin!
Go find your babies!

719
01:06:31,446 --> 01:06:33,780
Run, Kevin! Run!

720
01:06:36,317 --> 01:06:37,951
No!

721
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:45,417
Russell, give me your knife!

722
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,421
Get away from my bird!

723
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:16,823
No!

724
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,747
No!

725
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:34,007
Careful. We'll want her
in good shape for my return.

726
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:38,720
Let her go! Stop!

727
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,476
Kevin!

728
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:59,991
You gave away Kevin.

729
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:05,663
You just gave her away.

730
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,207
This is none of my concern.

731
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:13,087
I didn't ask for any of this!

732
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:18,510
Master, it's alright.

733
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:21,221
I am not your master!

734
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:24,683
And if you hadn't have shown up,
none of this would've happened!

735
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:27,435
Bad dog! Bad dog!

736
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:37,862
Now, whether you assist me or not,

737
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:41,950
I am going to Paradise Falls
if it kills me.

738
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:57,942
Here. I don't want this anymore.

739
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:39,664
Russell?

740
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:45,336
Russell!

741
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:49,298
I'm goanna help Kevin, even if you won't!

742
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:52,677
No, Russell! No!

743
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:06,584
Russell?

744
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:09,587
Dug!

745
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:14,300
I was hiding under your porch
because I love you. Can I stay?

746
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:16,803
Can you stay?
Well, you're my dog, aren't you?

747
01:15:16,804 --> 01:15:18,263
And I'm your master.

748
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:19,806
You're my master?

749
01:15:19,807 --> 01:15:21,266
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

750
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:24,518
Good boy, Dug!
You're a good boy!

751
01:15:49,837 --> 01:15:51,462
Yes!

752
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:55,299
Don't worry, Kevin. I'll save...

753
01:16:03,767 --> 01:16:06,005
And they wouldn't believe me.

754
01:16:06,207 --> 01:16:08,655
Just wait till they get a look at you.

755
01:16:09,056 --> 01:16:10,323
Master?

756
01:16:10,524 --> 01:16:14,151
- The small mailman has returned.
- What?

757
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:16,153
Let me go.

758
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:20,116
Where's your elderly friend?

759
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:24,036
He's not my friend anymore.

760
01:16:24,038 --> 01:16:27,998
Well, if you're here,
Frederickson can't be far behind.

761
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:31,168
Where are you keeping Kevin?

762
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:33,171
Let me go!

763
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:35,465
Scream all you want,
small mailman.

764
01:16:35,466 --> 01:16:38,342
None of your mailman friends
can hear you.

765
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:42,513
I'll unleash all my
Wilderness Explorer training!

766
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:47,644
Alpha, Fredericksons coming back.

767
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:51,356
Guard that bird. If you see the old man,
you know what to do.

768
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:54,734
Hey, where are you going?
I'm not finished with you!

769
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:57,153
Nice talking with you.

770
01:17:01,533 --> 01:17:04,201
Where are you, Frederickson?

771
01:17:22,221 --> 01:17:24,054
Russell!

772
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:39,236
- Mr. Frederickson!
- Dug, bring her over!

773
01:17:40,614 --> 01:17:43,241
You came back for Kevin!
Let's go get her!

774
01:17:43,242 --> 01:17:45,535
I'm getting Kevin. You stay here.

775
01:17:45,536 --> 01:17:46,786
But I want to help.

776
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:48,204
I don't want your help.

777
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:50,414
I want you safe.

778
01:17:57,089 --> 01:17:59,799
How do we get past these dogs?

779
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,634
Point!

780
01:18:11,603 --> 01:18:13,270
Kevin.

781
01:18:13,981 --> 01:18:16,941
Don't worry, Kevin. We're on our way.

782
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:20,569
Allow no one to be entering
through these doors.

783
01:18:20,612 --> 01:18:23,656
Guard well that bird, my minions.

784
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:25,991
What do we do now, Dug?

785
01:18:38,797 --> 01:18:41,131
Who wants the ball?

786
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:43,968
- Me! I want it!
- Me! I do!

787
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:45,470
- I want the ball!
- Give it to me!

788
01:18:45,471 --> 01:18:46,804
Then go get it!

789
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:49,307
I'm goanna get there first!

790
01:18:49,308 --> 01:18:50,808
Getting the ball!

791
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:52,768
I got it!

792
01:18:57,483 --> 01:19:00,485
I'm sorry, Kevin.
Let's get you out of here.

793
01:19:00,486 --> 01:19:02,612
Master! He's gone!
The old man!

794
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:03,696
He's here!

795
01:19:03,697 --> 01:19:05,948
- He's got the bird!
- The bird's gone...

796
01:19:05,949 --> 01:19:08,450
Calm down! One at a time!

797
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:14,707
I... want... to... help!

798
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:26,386
- He's in Hall D!
- He's in Hall C!

799
01:19:26,387 --> 01:19:28,221
It's the old man!

800
01:19:28,222 --> 01:19:31,765
Does anyone know where they are?

801
01:19:46,824 --> 01:19:49,575
Gray Leader? Take down the house.

802
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:57,208
Gray Leader, checking in.

803
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:58,334
Gray 2, checking in.

804
01:19:58,335 --> 01:20:00,002
Gray 3, checking in.

805
01:20:04,007 --> 01:20:05,841
Target sighted.

806
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:15,851
Come on, Kevin.

807
01:20:30,409 --> 01:20:32,076
Hi.

808
01:20:57,853 --> 01:21:01,689
Any last words, Frederickson? Come on!
Spit it out!

809
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:07,528
- Come on.
- Enough!

810
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:10,001
I am taking that bird back with me.

811
01:21:10,129 --> 01:21:12,741
Alive or dead!

812
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,728
Come on, Kevin.

813
01:21:59,456 --> 01:22:02,916
I will have many enjoyments
from what I am about to do, Dug.

814
01:22:10,801 --> 01:22:12,801
He wears the Cone of Shame!

815
01:22:12,844 --> 01:22:16,764
What? Do not just continue sitting.
Attack!

816
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:22,687
No, no! Stop your laughing!
Get this off of me!

817
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:25,105
Listen, you dog. Sit!

818
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:27,525
Yes, Alpha.

819
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:30,652
Alpha? I am not Alpha. He is...

820
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:35,407
I can't do it.

821
01:22:37,244 --> 01:22:38,661
Russell!

822
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,001
You leave Mr. Frederickson alone!

823
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:04,186
Hey, squirrel!

824
01:23:04,187 --> 01:23:06,272
Squirrel? Where? Where?

825
01:23:06,273 --> 01:23:08,107
Where's the squirrel?

826
01:23:11,445 --> 01:23:13,612
I hate squirrels.

827
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,384
Dug!

828
01:23:35,385 --> 01:23:37,094
Master!

829
01:23:37,638 --> 01:23:41,473
Russell! Over here! Let's go!

830
01:23:45,812 --> 01:23:48,147
Mr. Frederickson!

831
01:23:48,231 --> 01:23:50,357
Go on, Kevin!

832
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:06,415
No!

833
01:24:20,764 --> 01:24:23,599
Russell! Get out of there!

834
01:24:25,102 --> 01:24:27,728
No! Leave them alone!

835
01:24:42,536 --> 01:24:47,206
Russell, hang on to Kevin!
Don't let go of her!

836
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:51,376
Kevin! Chocolate!

837
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,525
That was cool!

838
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:21,949
Don't jerk around so much, kid!
Easy, Russell.

839
01:25:23,744 --> 01:25:26,745
I am ready to not be up high.

840
01:25:49,603 --> 01:25:52,771
Sorry about your house,
Mr. Frederickson.

841
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:58,193
You know, it's just a house.

842
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:08,412
Look at you. You're so soft.

843
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:14,459
I wish I could keep one.

844
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:20,882
Where's my cane? I just had it here.

845
01:26:28,642 --> 01:26:32,477
You know what? Keep them.
A little gift from me to you.

846
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:34,896
Bye, Kevin!

847
01:26:43,824 --> 01:26:45,491
Ready?

848
01:26:45,492 --> 01:26:47,326
Ready.

849
01:26:57,587 --> 01:26:59,421
And by receiving their badges,

850
01:26:59,422 --> 01:27:04,468
the following Explorers will graduate
to Senior Explorers.

851
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:08,556
For Extreme Mountaineering Lore.
Congratulations, Jimmy.

852
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:13,518
For Wild Animal Defensive Arts.
Congratulations, Brandon.

853
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:16,188
For Assisting the Elderly...

854
01:27:16,823 --> 01:27:20,192
Russell, is there someone that...

855
01:27:22,445 --> 01:27:26,031
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Old man coming through.

856
01:27:28,368 --> 01:27:30,077
I'm here for him.

857
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:32,829
Congratulations, Russell. Sir.

858
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:39,044
Russell, for Assisting the Elderly

859
01:27:39,045 --> 01:27:43,757
and for performing above
and beyond the call of duty,

860
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:49,012
I would like to award you
the highest honour I can bestow.

861
01:27:50,891 --> 01:27:53,141
The Ellie badge.

862
01:28:01,443 --> 01:28:04,028
All right, I think that covers everybody.

863
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:06,363
So let's give a big Explorer call

864
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:10,117
to our brand new
Senior Wilderness Explorers.

865
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:11,327
Ready, everybody?

866
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,129
- Blue one.
- Red one.

867
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:24,589
- Blue one.
- Gray one.

868
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:27,468
- Red one.
-  That's a bike.

869
01:28:27,469 --> 01:28:29,219
It's red, isn't it?

870
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:31,305
Mr. Frederickson, you're cheating.

871
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:33,182
No, I'm not. Red one.

872
01:28:33,183 --> 01:28:35,475
That's a fire hydrant.

873
01:28:37,103 --> 01:28:39,480
Maybe I need new glasses.

874
01:28:39,481 --> 01:28:42,078
Another blue one.
