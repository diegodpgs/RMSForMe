1
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,140
Look at me. Calm
down. Calm down!

2
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,580
What happened to the
others? Look at me.

3
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,460
Fucking dead! The
whole fucking platoon!

4
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,900
- The Sarge totally lost it, went nuts. Killed everyone!
- What?

5
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,220
Get off me! Let me go!

6
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,820
They're all dead!
All fucking gone!

7
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,540
Ah, you
son-of-a-bitch!

8
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,500
Let's get the fuck outta here!

9
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,940
Come on, man, let's move.
Move! Come on, man. Come on!

10
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,540
Sarge?

11
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,460
What the hell happened here?

12
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,980
They wouldn't listen.

13
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,300
The village was cleared.

14
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,220
These people are innocent.

15
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,900
They're all fucking traitors.

16
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,820
You turn around and
they stab ya in the back.

17
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,820
Hey, Sarge?

18
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,660
My tour's up. I
just want to go home.

19
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,260
Come on. Let's go home.

20
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,340
Let's go.

21
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,500
Just like the others.
You just want to leave.

22
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,100
Like none of this
shit ever happened?

23
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,820
It happened! And it
doesn't just go away.

24
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,780
You just can't walk
away, d'you hear me?

25
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,140
Do you hear me?

26
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,860
You're a traitor, too.
aren't you, farm boy?

27
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,140
No.

28
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,060
Prove it.

29
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,260
Kill her! Kill that
motherfuckin' traitor.

30
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,740
That's an order!

31
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,420
Get up. Come on!

32
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,580
Come on!

33
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,540
Come on.

34
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,980
Run!

35
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,180
No!

36
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,100
You got four
minutes! Four minutes!

37
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,380
- Okay, next.
- Four more.

38
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,060
- I mean, I can't find his tags.
- Excuse me, sir.

39
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,620
All right, here
we go. What the-

40
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,500
Oh, Jesus Christ!

41
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,140
Nice touch. I'd hate to
be the poor schmuck...

42
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,100
who has to explain this shit
back home to Ma and Pa, huh?

43
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,420
Sir, how do we
write this one up?

44
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,380
I mean, what do we
say happened here?

45
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,620
Nothin'. Nothin'
happened here at all.

46
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,860
MIA. We didn't find
anyone. d'you understand me?

47
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,140
What. they're
gonna call this MIA?

48
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,900
Lincoln, this is Eagle. Come in.
I've got a code zebra. Can you copy?

49
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,860
Only a few hours ago.
At least ten bodies.

50
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,900
- Yes, sir. Pack 'em in ice.
- We're movin' out.

51
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,380
Great.

52
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,340
Ice.

53
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,700
Let's move it, move it,
move it! Let's go, go, go!

54
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,900
All right. How's the picture?

55
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,660
- Pretty ugly.
- Very funny. Very funny.

56
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,100
I need a ladder.

57
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,260
Can you see me? How's my hair?

58
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,460
Let's go.

59
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,380
- Somebody my size. Yeah.
- Systems check.

60
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,340
Next.

61
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,500
- How's the focus?
- Next.

62
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,540
Good. Let's go.

63
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,820
Okay, brother, go.

64
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,740
All right, so we got 'em all.

65
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,340
We don't have much time.

66
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,020
- Position seven, status.
- They're bringing the next one out.

67
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,882
Excuse me. Excuse me, please.
I'll have a statement

68
00:11:41,883 --> 00:11:43,620
For you later on,
okay? Thank you.

69
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,140
Colonel, they just
killed another hostage.

70
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,380
- Current status.
- We can't even take one of them down.

71
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,020
They're all linked
to an intercom system.

72
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,940
They're in the water.

73
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,220
Colonel. where'd
you drop 'em off?

74
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,300
- About a mile and a half away.
- Mile and a half? We got 13 minutes.

75
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,380
- Ah, yo!
- Hold on a minute. Hold on.

76
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,820
Hi. I'm with the press, CNA. Uh.
they're waiting for me right there.

77
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,220
Right through there.

78
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,340
- I'm cancelling the remote.
- Aw, Charles, will you relax?

79
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,780
- We're supposed to go live here in one minute.
- He's gonna kill me.

80
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,460
- He's absolutely gonna kill me.
- Look out.

81
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,500
- Hey, where you goin'?
- See? There she is.

82
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,380
I know. I'm running
a little late.

83
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,620
- A little?
- Well, you know that traffic killed me.

84
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,620
- Veronica, we're live in 20. -
Twenty? - Where the hell were you?

85
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,900
- I've been phoning your hotel for hours.
- Your mark?

86
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,620
- I got my mark.
- Come on, come on, come on.

87
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,140
- We're on the satellite.
- Glasses. - Glasses.

88
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,740
- Mike.
- Mike. Okay.

89
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,460
- Ten. nine. eight,
seven- - Nice shoes.

90
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,780
- No feet.
- Hey, stop screwin' around. Come on.

91
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,500
- Three, and live.
- Cigarette!

92
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,907
With nearly 30 hostages
held inside the power station

93
00:13:05,908 --> 00:13:07,220
At the base of the structure.

94
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,820
the gunmen claim that they will not
release any of their prisoners...

95
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,460
until various of their comrades are
released from federal penitentiaries...

96
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,020
- across the United States.
- Checkpoint two, all clear.

97
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,020
Checkpoint three, all clear.

98
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,260
Keep your eyes open.

99
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,620
Shut up!

100
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,460
I said shut up!

101
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,940
Hey, do as you're told
and you won't get hurt.

102
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,380
Quiet down.

103
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,580
Checkpoint three, all clear.

104
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,780
- Colonel, they're at the tower. -
We need a unit. - A mile and a half...

105
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,820
under four minutes?

106
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,780
They're eight seconds
behind schedule.

107
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,420
This is Veronica Roberts
reporting live for CNA.

108
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,500
- And we're out.
- See? What'd I tell ya? No problem.

109
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,220
No problem? This network
does not revolve around you.

110
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,020
Well, what are you saying, Charles, I'm
not the center of the universe? Is that it?

111
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,940
- Don't crack wise with me.
- Come on, lighten up, Charles.

112
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,820
I mean, okay, I don't play the game by
your rules, but I always get you the story.

113
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,380
You think just because you broke a
few stories that you're indispensable.

114
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,460
Well, I had a little chat
with the network today,

115
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,980
- and you know what. Ronnie?
- No, what, Chuck?

116
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,100
You're fired.

117
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,700
They're entering the
drain-off tunnels.

118
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,980
GR13, take aim and hold fire.

119
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,540

00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,340
Fire.

122
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,740
Move in and secure
the objective.

123
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,660
Clear that image up.

124
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,620
Clear it.

125
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,500
Got it.

126
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,860
Interceptors are
secured and powered.

127
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,460
- Begin playback.
- Playback.

128
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,380

Checkpoint three, all clear.

131
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,620
They're buying it.

132
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,580
Who the hell are these guys?

133
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,020
- Okay, okay, here we go. here we go.
- Terminate objectives.

134
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,020
Checkpoint three, all clear.

135
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,540
Activate interceptors now.

136
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,140
I think homeboy's
startin' to like this shit.

137
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,540
Don't be ridiculous.
Continue playback.

138
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,100
Checkpoint three, all clear.

139
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,340
- Okay, we're inside.
- Begin phase two.

140
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,180
Phase two initiated.

141
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,300
- Look at this guy.
- How the hell did he-

142
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,220
- Hold it there, buddy!
- Hey! Hold it, pal!

143
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,580
Two gunmen, semiautomatic,

144
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,700
fully loaded, main
target to rear,

145
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,420
loaded pistol and
explosives detonator.

146
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,460
Shoot him!

147
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,500
You are cleared
- I repeat: you are cleared to proceed.

148
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,500
GR13, all clear.

149
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,100
No injuries. Gentlemen,
I think everybody's okay.

150
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:01,020
- Arizona team.
- GR44, status report.

151
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,500
- GR44, do you read me?
- Problem?

152
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,460
- He's- He's not responding.
- Well, try another frequency.

153
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,820
GR44, status report, now.

154
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,500
Kill the
motherfuckin' traitor.

155
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,100
That's an order!

156
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,340
GR44, respond!

157
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,500
Colonel Perry, how many of the
UniSols were injured in the rescue?

158
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,260
- Who are these guys, anyway?
- I will address your questions accordingly.

159
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,660
As you all know, this marks the third
successful mission for the universal soldiers,

160
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,940
again without any casualties
and without any injuries.

161
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,820
As to the identity
of the UniSols,

162
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,740
- that still remains
classified. - But, Colonel-

163
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:51,180
These men have families, and I will not
do anything to jeopardize their lives.

164
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,540
- Now if you'll excuse me. I have other
matters to attend to. - But, Colonel-

165
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,380
- Thank you.
- Lieutenant. could I have a statement, please?

166
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,260
There will be a complete
briefing this evening.

167
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,780
We can't shoot these guys. What the
hell are we doin' here? We need pictures.

168
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,220
Lieutenant, please, just,
just one statement. please.

169
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,220
Lieutenant!

170
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:16,140
Huey, I've got an idea.

171
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,060
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do.

172
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,580
I hate when you do this.

173
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,900
Ronnie, what are ya
doing? This is too close!

174
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,820
They're gonna see us.

175
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,300
We shouldn't be here.

176
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,060
All these guards. They
must still be in there, huh?

177
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,020
Yeah.

178
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,980
- You getting this?
- Those guys got one hell of a mobile home.

179
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,380
They're turning blue.
Lowering to final stage...

180
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,940
at 60 sub-zero.

181
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,820
He just froze up. We can't
figure out what happened.

182
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,100
- What do you mean 'froze up'?
- At the end of the mission,

183
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,300
he became completely
unresponsive.

184
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,540
- Did he overheat?
- Colonel, he hardly broke a sweat.

185
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,500
GR44.

186
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,660
Why did you not respond?

187
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,340
What happened?

188
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,180
- Innocent.
- Innocent?

189
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,660
What do you mean
by 'innocent'?

190
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,020
The village was cleared.

191
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,500
The girl was innocent, Sarge.

192
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,420
Sarge? Wh-wh-who the
hell's he talkin' about?

193
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,060
That could be an old memory.

194
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,740
I think we should take him out of the program
until we can run some tests on him...

195
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,100
and find out what's
going on in his head.

196
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,980
- GR44 stays with the
program. - But, Colonel-

197
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,140
He just got a little mixed
up. Just give him the serum.

198
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:13,780
Okay. guys, memory clearance.
Take your positions.

199
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,500
Activate injection.

200
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,380
They're moving something
else onto the Tarmac.

201
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,860
- We're not gonna get anything from out here.
- Ronnie, are you nuts?

202
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,260
It's a classified
military operation.

203
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,460
You're not gonna get within
ten yards of that truck.

204
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,620
I'll be right back.

205
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,420
- You were confused.
- I was confused.

206
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,980
You must follow
orders at all times.

207
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,500
I must follow my orders.

208
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,340
- He's fine.
- Well. if you say so.

209
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,500
You're in charge.

210
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,500
Here we go. Oh, this
looks pretty bad.

211
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,580
Looks pretty bad.

212
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,700
As soon as the flotation chamber
is filled, we'll have to put him in.

213
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,940
Great.

214
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,340
I always have to do this
part. I hate this part.

215
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:48,540
Hey, Dr. Haines! Dr. Haines!
Can I get a little help on this?

216
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,820
Jesus. No casualties
or injuries, huh?

217
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,260
Power up the cooling generators on
the flotation chamber. He's almost ready.

218
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,220
You got it.

219
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,100
- He's ready. Yes, sir.
- Bring him in. Thank you.

220
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,700
Prepare for flotation
chamber entry.

221
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,180
Colonel, we've
spotted an intruder.

222
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:50,500
Who the fuck is that?
She's takin' pictures.

223
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,820
- Huey!
- Oh. shit. What the hell has she done this time?

224
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,740
Start the car!

225
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,700
I think now would be a
good time to leave, Huey.

226
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,740
- What'd you get?
- Redemption.

227
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,060
Let's get outta here.

228
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,180
- Shit. Watch out!
- Look what you're doin'.

229
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,060
D'you think we lost 'em?

230
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,540
How ya doin'?

231
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:40,780
Uh, Veronica
Roberts, uh, uh, CNA.

232
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,140
You wanna help me out?

233
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,460
Thank you. Thank you very
- Hey, hey, hey! Easy!

234
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,700
- Take it easy, man.
- Ow! Oh!

235
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,380
Let go of me!

236
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,300
- Huey. Hu-
- Okay, okay.

237
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,100
You all right?

238
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,620
Okay, they got 'em. Bingo.

239
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,540
I want to speak to
someone in charge.

240
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:17,580
- You guys speak English?
- Awaiting instructions.

241
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,340
Tell them to find that film and
bring those civilians back to base.

242
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:26,060
I'm sure that we can handle this whole situation,
all right? Uh, if I could make a phone call.

243
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,100
- What's wrong with these
guys? - I don't know. - GR13.

244
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,020
get the film and
return to base.

245
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:34,820
- The film. - Uh, fellas.
look, I don't know where-

246
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,380
- Hey, hey, I don't know what
you- - Hey, she didn't do anything.

247
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,140
Christ! GR13, cease
fire! Cease fire!

248
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,500
Do you read me? Cease
fire! Cease fire! I repeat:

249
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,860
- Fire. Fire.
- That's an order!

250
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,860
GR86, visual.

251
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,300
What the fuck is he doin'?

252
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:10,780
Stop the girl.
Shoot if you have to.

253
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,500
GR44. stop the car.

254
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:22,260
That is an order.

255
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,660
- Whaddya doin'? Whaddya doin'? - He
stopped the car. - Cease fire! Cease fire!

256
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,260
What the hell you doing?
Come on! Get out of here!

257
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,100
Hey, go! Jesus Christ,
they're gonna kill us!

258
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:36,780
- GR44, turn the car around.
- Are you deaf?

259
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,500
You are simply confused.

260
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:43,220
- I'm confused.
- What are you talking about, man? Let's go. Hit it!

261
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:47,700
- Do not listen to her.
- What the hell is that thing?

262
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:52,380
- GR44, can you hear me? - Will you
stop fuckin'- Stupid piece of shit!

263
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,780
Shit! The bitch cut me off.

264
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,460
- Go!
- I must follow orders.

265
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,620
Bull shit. Hit the road!

266
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,940
Shit!

267
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,940
Woodward, do
something, will ya?

268
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,300
Traitor.

269
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,700
He didn't do anything.

270
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,820
Well. they're not gonna get away
with this shit. I swear to God,

271
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,180
- they're not gonna get away with this shit.
- You ready?

272
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,300
- Just about.
- We have to take him out of the loop.

273
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,300
- He shot a man, for God's sake.
- Don't tell me what to do.

274
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,940
Right now I need every soldier I've
got. We're goin' after them.

275
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,740
Colonel Perry.

276
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,300
We killed an innocent man.

277
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,660
What do you suggest
we do, Woodward?

278
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,340
Let that reporter run off
with one of our UniSols?

279
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,580
We can't just cover this up.

280
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,820
We have a moral obligation
to tell the truth about this.

281
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:53,460
I thought you were more
clever than that, Woodward.

282
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,620
This whole goddamn
program is off the shelf.

283
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:59,620
Do you really think for one second
those wimps at the Pentagon...

284
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:03,180
would allow the regeneration
of dead soldiers,

285
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,740
American soldiers?

286
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,100
I don't think I can be
a part of this anymore.

287
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:13,180
If this is uncovered now,
we're all goin' to jail.

288
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,580
Do I make myself clear?

289
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,900
Why did you do that?

290
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,820
Why did you help
me out like that?

291
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,740
My tour's up. Just
want to go home.

292
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,780
But I can't until you're safe.

293
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,060
Wh-what do you mean?

294
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:39,020
My God! You've been shot!

295
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:42,700
Oh, Jesus. Jesus, we
gotta stop the bleeding.

296
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,940
Oh, God.

297
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,180
Jesus Christ, it's
gotta hurt you, man.

298
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,900
The bleeding has stopped.

299
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,540
Get in here. Secure
your positions.

300
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,020
All right, secure and lock!

301
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:30,020
What, wh-why are we
stopping now? What happened?

302
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,220
Out of gas.

303
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,380
We're out of gas. Why not?

304
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,340
Shit! God!

305
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,460
- Oh, God.
- Tracking system activated and we're in business.

306
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:04,060
We've picked 'em up moving due
east seven miles ahead of us.

307
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,980
Estimated time
of interception.

308
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,260
- Four minutes.
- Four minutes and marking.

309
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:28,340
How ya doin'?

310
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:32,180
You must be pretty tired after
all that, that pushing and stuff.

311
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:35,660
Okay. well, I'm gonna go on the
- I'll be right back, all right?

312
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:40,860
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna go make a phone call.

313
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,780
You mind?

314
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,900
Okay? Okay.

315
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,980
Okay.

316
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,300
Change.

317
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:03,020
Okay. All right.

318
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:15,900
- I need some gas.
- Oh, ran out of gas yesterday.

319
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:19,260
Uh, refuelin' truck will
be here in the morning.

320
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,700
You wanna rent a roo
- room?

321
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,180
Nice outfit.

322
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,380
Shit.

323
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,300
Hey, pal, you
don't look so good.

324
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:40,060
- I need to cool down.
- Oh, well, all our rooms...

325
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,980
all have
air-conditioning, you know?

326
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,500
Got some with water beds.

327
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,580
Hey. the, uh, pay phone's out.
Do you have a phone I can use?

328
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:51,060
All our rooms all have
telephones, too, only $50 a night.

329
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,900
No, no, look, I don't need
a room, I need a phone.

330
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:58,740
- What about this one?
- Oh, uh, sorry, that's, uh, for employees only. Yeah.

331
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:19,340
Oh, well. since there's the two of you,
see, that's called double occupancy.

332
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,820
That's another
ten dollars. Yeah.

333
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,420
Yeah, okay. Great.

334
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:29,100
And a matter of a small
$20 security deposit.

335
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,020
Of course. Twenty
dollars. Here you are.

336
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,060
- Have a nice stay.
- Great.

337
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,340
Great. Maybe there's already
something on the news.

338
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,540
Commence UniSol deployment.

339
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,420
B and C teams, take
supporting positions.

340
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,940
GR13, seek and destroy
local communication lines...

341
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,500
in target area.

342
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:35,020
And one prays for the expedient.
concise handling of the terrorist situation.

343
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:39,260
In a related story. only hours
after the rescue at McKinley dam,

344
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,660
news reporters
become news makers.

345
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:44,660
Reporting live from the
scene, Chris Garfield.

346
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,780
In a surprising development.
a CNA cameraman, Huey Taylor.

347
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,500
was shot and killed in a motel
room in neighboring Eagle Rock City.

348
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,980
Witnesses allege that Veronica
Roberts, a CNA correspondent,

349
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,020
shot him after an
apparent argument.

350
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,540
- No. I don't believe it.
- Cocaine and other narcotics were found at the scene.

351
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,500
No way.

352
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:07,260
No way. I don't believe this.

353
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,900
They are not gonna get away with
this, man. I mean, this is crazy.

354
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:13,940
- You must return to your room. -
There isn't- I mean, for cryin' out loud.

355
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,900
Mother, come here.

356
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:19,620
There has got to be a phone that
works in this godforsaken place.

357
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,860
- This area is not secure.
- You know, why don't you-

358
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,940
What are you doing?

359
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,180
It's not safe
for you out here.

360
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,300
Where're your clothes?

361
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,980
I have to-

362
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,980
I have to cool down.

363
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,660
My God! You're burning up!

364
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:55,740
I-I-I
need i-ice.

365
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,420
Okay, okay.

366
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,500
Shame on ya.

367
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,500
GR13, continue advance.

368
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,540
Target in center of structure.

369
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:20,220
What the devil's she
doin' with all that ice?

370
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,340
Maybe I should
call the police.

371
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:26,660
I've heard of cold showers before,
but this is just ridiculous.

372
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,460
How ya doin'?

373
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,900
I got all the ice
that I, I could. Uh,

374
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,420
you okay?

375
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,180
How's your-

376
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,780
Your wound.

377
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,100
It's, it's healing.

378
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:55,700
I'm
- I'm, uh, gonna make that phone call and, uh,

379
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,620
I'll, uh, call a doctor...

380
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,340
or something.

381
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,300
Heat and infrared check.

382
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,980
Munitions and firearms
identifier powered and working.

383
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,500
- Don't even start with me, all right?
- Hey!

384
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,260
- And take this lock off. No, I'll take it off.
- Hey!

385
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,700
Hey, lady, what are
you doin' to the phone?

386
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,020
- You know how much these
things cost me? - Sh-Shut up.

387
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,660
- Forget- You got a lot of
nerve. - Will you shut up?

388
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,140
- This one doesn't work either.
- Huh?

389
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,700
Women just don't know
how to use phones.

390
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,660
You killed it!

391
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,780
Hey, this is coming out
of your security deposit.

392
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:37,220
Goddamn it. He's
got her in sight.

393
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:41,140
GR13 has a lock on the girl.
What do you want me to do?

394
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,820
- Tell him to wait 'til they're together.
- GR13, hold your fire...

395
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,340
and maintain surveillance.

396
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:05,260
Now, back to 'Nixon and
the War Years, Part Seven.'

397
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,380
We will keep America the
strongest nation in the world,

398
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:12,340
and we will couple that
strength with firm diplomacy.

399
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:15,260
No apologies, no regrets.

400
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,260
Uh, there was no
question about that...

401
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,420
because, as you
know, when I resigned,

402
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,500
uh, later, President
Ford issued a pardon.

403
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:28,340
When I accepted the pardon.
in that I made it very clear...

404
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,740
that I regretted what had
happened. and to what's, in effect,

405
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:34,100
an apology for what had
happened. There are, however-

406
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,100
I want that place
completely surrounded.

407
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:41,180
GR86 and 61, take positions
at the rear of the motel.

408
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,100
...on the war in
Vietnam, uh, who-

409
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,580
How are you. uh
- How you feeling?

410
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,420
The war is over.

411
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,780
Maybe not.

412
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,380
All focus to visual. Powering
alternate scanning devices.

413
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,620
Motion detectors locked in.

414
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,540
You know, something really
weird is going on around here.

415
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,740
None of the phones in
this entire hotel work.

416
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,460
I mean, there
hasn't been a storm.

417
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,300
Okay, we got 'em in
the second room now.

418
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,500
You better duck and cover.

419
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:43,180
- Follow me.
- Okay.

420
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,180
The last wall is solid
concrete. He's not goin' anywhere.

421
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,660
I think we got him trapped.

422
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,500
Well, go ahead. Knock it down.

423
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,940
What?

424
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,940
Get down.

425
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,300
Soldiers, move in.

426
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:50,220
Where in the hell is he?

427
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,140
- I think we lost him.
- That's impossible.

428
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:57,140
Garth, get back to your station and
get me some tracking, for Christ's sake.

429
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,180
- You have a
car? - Uh-huh.

430
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,580
- Give me the keys.
- Hurry up. Tell him to hurry.

431
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,260
- Hurry.
- Ya got 'em?

432
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,980
- Thank you.
- Oh, good.

433
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,620
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

434
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:18,020
I am so, so sorry. Believe me, I had
nothing to do with this. Really. I had no idea.

435
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,700
- They're leavin' the motel.
- Damn it!

436
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,820
- Hey!
- Oh, my God!

437
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,860
Come on, Woodward.
I need you out here.

438
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,700
Way to go, Garth.

439
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,620
Twenty-dollar
security deposit, huh?

440
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,140
Woodward.

441
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,300
He's trying to cool himself.

442
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,900
Are you sure they're
not following us?

443
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,660
No.

444
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:39,300
- You're such a comfort.
- Buckle up.

445
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,580
- I'm fine.
- It's for your safety.

446
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,500
How can you be so damn calm?

447
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:47,900
I mean. your buddies back there just shot enough
ammo at us to destroy eastern Europe,

448
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:52,220
and you're sitting here bitching
at me about a goddamn seat belt?

449
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:55,820
All right, all right, all
right. here we go. All right?

450
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:00,100
I'm all buckled up. All
right, look. Mr. Top Secret.

451
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,580
I want some answers, okay?

452
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:08,860
I mean, first of all, you know, you, uh, you
push a car faster than my mother drives, okay?

453
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,580
Uh, uh, you use ice like
other people use band-aids,

454
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,300
and, and, and, and then you
just, you run through walls.

455
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:17,780
Now. I'm sorry, you know. but
this is not normal human behavior.

456
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:21,140
Now just who the hell are you?

457
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:24,380
Where are you from, anyway? Are
you from France or Canada or-

458
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,140
I mean, I figure you gotta be French
or something because of your accent.

459
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:31,220
What accent?

460
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:34,420
All right, look, you. um, you
got a family? You got friends?

461
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,220
I mean, is there a Mrs. 44
waiting for you someplace? Uh-

462
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,300
I mean, are you avoiding my
questions, or. or don't you know?

463
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,740
What the hell did
they do to you?

464
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,700
I don't know.

465
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:13,980
But I'm going to find out.

466
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:42,300
- Hey. lady. no smokin' around the pumps.
- I'm sorry.

467
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,980
- Come on.
- Hey! Hey, come on! Would you quit pulling on my arm?

468
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:47,700
- It hurts.
- Park the car.

469
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,180
- Park the-
- Let's go.

470
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,020
- Park the car?
- I need some help.

471
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,660
You need some help? Oh, hey, come on.
man. I can't help you with this thing.

472
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,660
- Get in.
- Hey! Come on!

473
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,180
What are you doing? Huh?

474
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,300
Oh, come on, man,
not this again, huh?

475
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:09,220
Is this necessary? Well, could you at
least leave your pants on this time?

476
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,620
Great. Just great.

477
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,740
There must be a
tracking device on me.

478
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,660
Well, what do you
want me to do about it?

479
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,620
Look for something unusual.

480
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,420
Something hard.

481
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,260
Okay. All right.

482
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:34,060
Stay in shape, don't ya?

483
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,460
- What are you doing in there?
- Nothing!

484
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,580
What do you mean
park your car?

485
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,620
What, you never heard
of valet parking?

486
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:44,100
Valet. Do I look like a valet?

487
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,460
What does this look
like. Beverly Hills?

488
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,780
Is that supposed to be there?

489
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:53,260
Yes. Ye-yeah, it is. It's,
uh, it's very- very normal.

490
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,220
Keep going.

491
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,780
Right.

492
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:04,220
Update informational
computer scanning system.

493
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:07,460
They've stopped up ahead in
front of a single-story structure.

494
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:11,380
I think I found something. Right
here on the back of your leg.

495
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,020
- Cut it out.
- Cut it out?

496
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:24,540
Hey, wait a minute. I-I-I can't- I
can't cut it out. I'm not gonna cut you.

497
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:30,220
Oh! Oh, God!

498
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:36,700
Oh, shit! Shit!

499
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:40,820
You best hurry up and get out of
there. I got a business to run here.

500
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:46,140
- Take it.
- What?

501
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,540
- Take it!
- Take it?

502
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:51,460
We don't have too much time.

503
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:55,220
Oh, fu
- God, this is so gross!

504
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,820
Oh, God, this is so gross.

505
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,460
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

506
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:09,420
Good. I gotta lie down.

507
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:33,220
I want a complete scan
of the entire area.

508
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,460
Enabling infrared.

509
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:41,180
- That's his car.
- Scanning for body heat.

510
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,620
- Got it.
- Arms.

511
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:46,380
Pistol, fully loaded.
Desert Eagle. semiautomatic.

512
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,820
- That's him.
- Motions and heat scan.

513
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,180
Follow tracking.
Flanking advance pattern.

514
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:55,420
Three teams,
north, east, south.

515
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:59,020
- Converge on my command.
- Team, advance.

516
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,940
Surround target.
Teams east and south,

517
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,940
prepare for break and ram.

518
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:16,460
Prepare for break
and ram. Full charge.

519
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:19,300
- Okay, guys, move in.
- Full charge.

520
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,980
No, no! He tricked
us! H-hold on!

521
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:32,980
Move out! Move out! All
UniSols, retreat immediately!

522
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:36,700
Evacuate! Let's go!
Get out of there!

523
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,220
Take cover!

524
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,380
- Take cover!
- What the hell was that?

525
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:59,260
Oh, my God. They're on fire.

526
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:03,380
Portable coolant.
Portable coolant, quick!

527
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,420
Sarge!

528
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,620
Get him out! Extinguishers!
Woodward, Garth!

529
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,460
Garth! Get over here! Get
this guy. Get this guy.

530
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:24,300
- Quick! Quick! Quick!
- GR74. Get GR14.

531
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:26,300
Over here, Woodward!
Get him. Get him down.

532
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:31,380
Damn you! Put him out, I said! All
right, get those coolants ready!

533
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,340
Get that truck operating!

534
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:38,060
Woodward, get 'em
over here! Get more-

535
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:45,260
Hurry up.

536
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:47,700
- Yes. Sarge.
- God!

537
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,100
Whoa.

538
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:00,180
- Huh?
- Get over here! Get over here! Get GR74!

539
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:02,140
Get him out! Put
that coolant on him!

540
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:08,540
- We need more extinguishers!
- Got it, got it. Let's go!

541
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:11,740
- Come on! Hurry!
- Huh?

542
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:14,340
Well, here I go
again. I'm outta here.

543
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:24,980
- Come on. We're gonna lose these two, Colonel.
- $250 million apiece,

544
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:27,020
- we can't afford to lose any of 'em.
- Buckle up.

545
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:29,620
Seat belt, right.
Okay, go. Go!

546
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:07,140
Oh, Jesus. He
should've buckled up.

547
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:10,780
He's getting up. Go!
Go, go, go, go, go! Go!

548
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:28,580
Shit! They're pullin' the plug.
Pack it up. We're headin' home.

549
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,500
- Everybody, back into the truck. Come on, everybody.
- Let's go! Let's move it!

550
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,620
Woodward, what the
hell are you doin'?

551
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:36,340
Yes, it's ice! Get
back in the truck!

552
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,300
Pack it up!

553
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:47,460
Get back into the truck,
GR13. The mission is cancelled.

554
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,340
GR13.

555
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,980
I said it's over.

556
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:01,140
My name is Sergeant
Andrew Scott.

557
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:34,100
He's just a mess. Lieutenant,
could you contact Colonel Perry?

558
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:37,060
We'd like to have him
back in here. Thank you.

559
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,180
You're wasting your time.

560
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:46,260
- He can't hear you.
- Jesus!

561
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:49,020
I've relieved Colonel
Perry of his command.

562
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:52,020
GR13, this mission
has been cancelled.

563
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:55,460
I order you back to the
cooling chamber, now!

564
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,420
Orders?

565
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,700
I'm giving the
orders from now on.

566
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:06,420
We have a mission to complete.

567
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,420
Any questions?

568
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,500
Uh-oh.

569
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:31,980
- Somethin' to drink?
- Uh. yeah. I'll just have coffee.

570
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:33,940
Okay. You?

571
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:41,340
Brenda?

572
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,300
Yes, Joe?

573
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:48,100
Hey, uh, you want
something to drink?

574
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:52,540
- Yeah? Okay. He'll have a soda pop.
- Great.

575
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:55,140
- He's not gonna make it.
- Will you just shut up? He'll hear you!

576
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:58,100
- Dr. Haines- - Look, if
he thinks that we failed,

577
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,060
he's gonna kill us both.

578
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:03,260
You just keep working. If he
asks anything, just stall him.

579
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,860
What's he doing?

580
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:16,940
Overloading on muscle enhancers.
He's making himself stronger.

581
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:19,940
Oh, great. That's
just what we need.

582
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:26,500
You know, I feel like I'm
back in high school again.

583
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,860
I can't make heads or tails
out of any of this stuff.

584
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:32,660
But apparently, whatever
they've done to you,

585
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:36,220
it's been done on
a genetic level.

586
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:41,620
'The Surgeon General has warned that
cigarettes could be hazardous to your health.'

587
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:44,460
Yeah, well, don't believe
everything you read.

588
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:50,900
- Hey. Hey, hey! That is my last pack.
- Are you ready to order?

589
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:53,300
Uh, uh. uh, yeah. Just, uh-

590
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:56,220
Just bring us two
of your specials.

591
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:59,540
N-Now look, they constantly
refer to a Dr. Christopher Gregor.

592
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,700
Now, do you
recognize that name?

593
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:03,940
No?

594
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:06,220
Nothing. Hmm.

595
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,820
I think I saw a number
in here somewhere.

596
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,500
Do you think you can help me?

597
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:14,100
Well, it's, uh,
definitely worth a shot.

598
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:24,180
- What?
- Why are you doing all this for me?

599
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:29,020
I'm not. All right?

600
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:32,540
I'm not doing all this for
you. I'm doing it for me.

601
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:34,580
I mean, you may not
realize this yet, but...

602
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,980
you are one hell of a story.

603
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:41,500
I wouldn't worry, though.
Uh, when the truth comes out,

604
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:44,300
they'll, they'll
probably make you a hero.

605
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:49,660
Ah. Here we go. 'CG.'
Christopher Gregor.

606
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:55,140
All right, look, I'm, uh, I'm gonna go
check this out. You, uh, you stay here...

607
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:57,740
and wait for the
specials, okay?

608
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:00,980
All right? Oh, uh,
do you have a phone?

609
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,380
Out there.

610
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:05,340
- Thanks.
- Here's the special.

611
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:53,180
Sergeant Scott.

612
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:55,380
Could I have a word with you?

613
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:57,460
I'm all ears.

614
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:03,380
Your thermal monitor.
It's registering hot.

615
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:15,380
Uh-oh. Nap time.

616
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:26,420
Are you nuts?

617
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:28,900
Why'd you tell him that?

618
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,860
Quadruple his serum.

619
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,060
What?

620
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:38,060
I'm going inside.

621
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:44,500
When he sits down,
I'll give you a signal.

622
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:46,500
You increase the pressure,

623
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:49,940
and I'll engage the injection
device on the arm of his chair.

624
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:59,460
No, no, no.

625
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:02,300
It'll look better if I go.

626
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,940
Is there a problem. medic?

627
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:46,380
No, I'm just checking
the, uh, injection device.

628
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:48,980
- Was it broken?
- It's making some strange noises.

629
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,860
I just wanted to
make an adjustment.

630
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:54,100
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

631
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:58,220
Let's see if it still works.

632
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:02,660
Dr. Haines!

633
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:05,300
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Are you ready?

634
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:08,420
- It's memory clearance time.
- Stop it! Get up! No!

635
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:10,980
- Stop it! You're gonna kill him!
- Dr. Haines! Dr. Haines!

636
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:13,740
- Let him go!
- No!

637
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:19,460
- Don't. Stop it!
- Get off me! Get off me!

638
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,460
Get off of me!

639
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:37,460
Shit. A fax.

640
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,420
Hey. you got enough
money to pay for all this?

641
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:05,260
You know, money? Cash?

642
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:07,620
Dollars? Dinero?

643
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:14,940
Hank!

644
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:18,460
- Yeah.
- We got ourselves a deadbeat back here.

645
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:22,620
- What?
- He can't pay.

646
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:24,900
Move it, Brenda.

647
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:28,700
Hey, punk, I been slavin'
all day makin' that slop.

648
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,620
- The food is good.
- Fuckin' A it is.

649
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:37,780
The question is. how are
you going to pay for it?

650
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:41,980
I don't know.

651
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:44,420
You don't know.
Ain't that cute.

652
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:46,940
I'm gonna bust
your head, punk.

653
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:50,140
I don't want to hurt you.

654
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:52,980
Me? You don't
want to hurt Hank?

655
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:21,260
I just want to eat.

656
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:23,700
- Operator.
- Uh, yeah. operator, uh, a local number:

657
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:26,980
prefix KL5, a Dr.
Christopher Gregor.

658
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:35,020
Hey, look, you
ugly son-of-a-bitch!

659
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:54,300
Hey! You better put that down, you
son-of-a- bitch, because now I'm gonna make you bleed!

660
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:55,860
- May I help you?
- Uh, Veteran's Hospital?

661
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:58,380
- Yes.
- Great. Operator, can you tell me exactly where that is?

662
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:01,220
- 1087 Clinton Avenue.
- Clinton. Wonderful.

663
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:03,180
Thank you very much.

664
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:11,100
Oh, shit.

665
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:30,020
How was lunch, huh?

666
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:10,580
I'm lookin' for a deserter.

667
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:13,580
He's traveling
with a female POW.

668
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:17,620
- Beat it, asshole.
- Hey. soldier boy. I'll be your POW.

669
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:20,660
Nice necklace. I got one just
like it made out of noses.

670
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:29,540
Now, they're in this
white and yellow Buick...

671
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:33,020
with no front or rear window.

672
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:35,700
Does that refresh your memory?

673
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:49,780
GR74.

674
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:53,220
Sergeant Scott has
issued an order.

675
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:55,340
Will you obey that order?

676
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:58,500
Yes, sir.

677
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:02,660
He would like for you to
hold this for 30 seconds...

678
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:04,620
and then drop it.

679
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:14,940
One, two, three-

680
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:18,300
- I know which way they went. You got a pencil?
- Yeah? Sure.

681
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:20,820
By the way, I like your
belt. Can I have it?

682
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:24,780
25, 26-

683
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:43,660
Hey! Where's the freezer?

684
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:20,420
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yes, we would like to speak with Dr. Gregor?

685
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:23,380
Do you have an appointment?

686
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:25,380
Yes. Yes, we do.

687
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:30,820
- Follow me.
- Thank you.

688
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:35,860
- Wait in there.
- Okay. Thank you.

689
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:44,700
Oh. God.

690
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:50,740
Oh, man, I'd kill for
a cigarette right now.

691
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:53,540
You would kill someone
for a cigarette?

692
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:57,420
No, no. It's an expression.
You know, a figure of speech.

693
01:04:57,540 --> 01:05:01,820
I mean, I wouldn't actually
kill someone for a cigarette.

694
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:05,180
I might hurt 'em bad at this point,
but I don't think I'd kill 'em.

695
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:11,380
Dr. Gregor, excuse me.

696
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:14,540
- Yes? What is it?
- There's a young couple here to see you.

697
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:18,460
- They say they have an appointment.
- Appointment?

698
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:30,900
- No!
- Clear!

699
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:34,380
Clear.

700
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,660
It's all right, Luc.

701
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:43,340
It's all right. It's over.

702
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:57,900
I-I saw it.

703
01:05:57,980 --> 01:06:00,700
I remember h
- home.

704
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:03,500
Is he all right? Let's
get him into the bathroom.

705
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:04,820
We have to cover him with ice.

706
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:09,140
I said stand at attention,
private! Stand up!

707
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:22,460
Goddamn it! The whole fuckin'
platoon's droppin' like flies!

708
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:28,260
What the hell are
you staring at?

709
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:32,860
Do you have any idea what
it's like out there? Do you?

710
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:37,660
Well, I'm fighting this thing,
man. It's like kick ass or kiss ass.

711
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:40,780
And I'm bustin' heads.

712
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:43,100
It's the only way to
win this fucking war.

713
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:48,340
And these shitheads,

714
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:54,260
these yellow,
traitoring motherfuckers,

715
01:06:56,460 --> 01:06:58,820
they're everywhere.

716
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:05,820
And I,

717
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:11,420
Sergeant Andrew Scott
of the U.S. Army,

718
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:18,620
I'm gonna teach 'em all.

719
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:20,700
- Hey. freeze!
- Get down!

720
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:26,540
Drop your weapon!

721
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:30,940
See?

722
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:36,380
They're everywhere.

723
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:40,020
How could you, a doctor,
be a party to this?

724
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:44,500
I've been asking myself
that question for years.

725
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:48,260
- Tell me how it worked. - By
hyper- accelerating the bodies,

726
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:53,020
we discovered that we could turn
dead flesh into living tissue.

727
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:54,940
But to make the process work,

728
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:57,700
the bodies ran at
dangerously high temperatures,

729
01:07:57,820 --> 01:07:59,820
needed to be
constantly cooled,

730
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:03,180
the brain sedated. controlled.

731
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:06,740
Otherwise, it would
eventually stroke.

732
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:09,660
- What are you saying, Doctor?
- Dr. Gregor.

733
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:12,220
Excuse me. Yes? What is it?

734
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,180
Thanks.

735
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:23,980
Officials believe Colonel Perry was
shot and killed early this morning.

736
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:27,340
Authorities are still looking
for reporter Veronica Roberts.

737
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:29,940
believed to be linked
to the two deaths.

738
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:33,820
- They've set you up.
- Closer to home. a robbery at Hayes Supermarket...

739
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:35,860
turned deadly when
three armed men...

740
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:38,180
entered the supermarket
earlier today.

741
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:42,700
- The leader of the gang was videotaped-
- Regressive traumatic recall.

742
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:46,980
- What?
- Trauma inflicted at the time of death.

743
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:49,460
See, in Luc's case.
he wanted to go home.

744
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:53,380
When he awoke as a UniSol, he
returned to that single emotion.

745
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:58,260
As for Scott. he thinks he's still
in Vietnam fighting the insurgents.

746
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:00,540
He doesn't realize he's alive.

747
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:02,660
He's not.

748
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:06,660
He's dead. just like me.

749
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:10,660
- Be sure to write.
- Now boarding, Los Angeles Express.

750
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:12,740
Now boarding.

751
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:15,100
This is insane.

752
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:17,900
You heard what the doctor
said. You need medical help.

753
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:19,860
I think that you should
just turn yourself in...

754
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:21,980
and, and get started on
your treatments again.

755
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:24,860
- And then?
- Well, then we expose everything.

756
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:27,340
I mean, Dr. Gregor
will help us.

757
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:30,060
I just want to go home.

758
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:33,660
You don't seem to understand.
There's a chance you won't make it.

759
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:36,340
- I'm already dead.
- No, you're not.

760
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:38,980
Goddamn it, you are
not dead, all right?

761
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:43,780
You're alive. And that is precious.
You don't just throw that away.

762
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:46,660
Now boarding, Los
Angeles direct line.

763
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:55,820
A bus ticket? Wh-

764
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,980
To Los Angeles.

765
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:05,940
Well- Wh-wh-what
is this for?

766
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:07,900
You're safe now.

767
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:11,420
He's only coming after me.

768
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:14,540
You know, you're, you're
making a big mistake here.

769
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:17,620
You've got your story.
That's what you wanted.

770
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:20,420
You think-

771
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:24,900
Last call, Los Angeles
Express. Now boarding.

772
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:27,180
Last call.

773
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:31,220
Passengers bound for Los
Angeles, now boarding.

774
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:33,660
Last call.

775
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:30,820
You should have left me
while you had a chance.

776
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:36,140
What, and miss all the fun?

777
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:06,060
Shit!

778
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:10,558
We're gonna take 'em
over to County right now.

779
01:12:10,559 --> 01:12:12,180
Should get there
just after lunch.

780
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:22,140
Oh, shit!

781
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:31,420
Get rid of 'em.

782
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:35,740
Oh, shit.

783
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:47,900
- Got you now. boy. - Jesus Christ,
he- He's comin' right for us!

784
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:58,100
Hey! Driver!

785
01:12:58,220 --> 01:13:00,660
Get us outta here! Help!

786
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:14,940
Holy shit!

787
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:26,140
Excuse me. You should
check on your driver, pal.

788
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:28,340
He don't look too hot.

789
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:38,300
- What do we do now?
- We have to stop the bus.

790
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:41,220
Oh. gee, that's a great
idea. What a concept.

791
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:50,260
What are you doing now?

792
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:52,340
What the hell!

793
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:23,860
Is it working?

794
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:39,820
- Oh, God.
- Do you want to play catch?

795
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:42,100
What do I do? What do I do?

796
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:52,620
Oh, shit!

797
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:55,940
Can't find it. Here. Oh, God.

798
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:03,180
Are we having fun yet?

799
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:24,220
Oh, my God!

800
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:29,180
- You jump. -
W-W-Wait a minute.

801
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:30,492
Wh-What happened
to that whole idea

802
01:15:30,493 --> 01:15:32,180
About stopping the bus?
I mean, I liked that idea.

803
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:36,180
- You jump!
- I'm not goin' anywhere without you.

804
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:49,900
- We'll jump together.
- Okay. Together.

805
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:54,700
Okay. Okay.

806
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:57,060
Oh, shit.

807
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:23,260
Hit him! Hit him hard!

808
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:44,380
Get the fuck up.
soldier! Get the fuck up!

809
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:52,220
Fuck!

810
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:34,900
Freeze!

811
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:37,340
Now, hold it right there!

812
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:46,100
Turn around. Get down
on your knees right now.

813
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:48,780
Put your hands over your head.

814
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:52,060
Put your hands over your head!

815
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:01,340
I had three brothers.
Come on. Let's go.

816
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:05,900
Keys. Come on! Get up!

817
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:08,620
Money. Here. Here we go.

818
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:12,980
Thank you. Come on, here
we go. Let's go, let's go.

819
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:16,140
Get in the car. I'll
drive, I'll drive.

820
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:20,060
Come on. Get in
the car. Hurry up!

821
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:25,620
I'm gonna take you home.

822
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:29,500
Buckle up.

823
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:20,420
John, there's somebody
in the driveway. I think.

824
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:28,700
Mrs. Devreux?

825
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:39,540
John, come here! Oh,
Luc, mon fils! Luc!

826
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:55,500
Uh, wait a minute. What do
you mean Charles isn't there?

827
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:58,260
Well, where the hell is he?

828
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:01,580
No, look, I-I don't care what you've
heard, all right? It's not true.

829
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:05,140
No, look-

830
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:09,060
- All right.
- Okay. uh, yeah, yeah.

831
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:12,580
- He's alive.
- I'll meet them there.

832
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:14,020
All right.

833
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:20,860
Um, I'm gonna
have to get going.

834
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:25,180
A news van from the network is gonna
meet me at the Sheriff's station.

835
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:29,460
They still don't believe me, but, uh, I
think we'll be able to change their minds.

836
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:32,540
You okay?

837
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:35,420
So many things are missing.

838
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:38,060
So many things I remember.

839
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:41,780
So many things I, I can't.

840
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:45,500
Luc, it has been 25 years.

841
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:49,940
Such a long time, 25 years.

842
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:55,540
I'll never get
those years back.

843
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:57,500
Look at it this way:

844
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:01,940
You look great
for a 50-year-old.

845
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:09,900
Care for a cup, Miss Roberts?

846
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:11,780
Oh, um.

847
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:16,060
No, no, I, uh, I better get going,
ya know. They'll be waiting for me.

848
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:24,100
- Be careful. It's turning into a downpour.
- Okay.

849
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:26,260
- Thank you. Thank you both.
- You're welcome.

850
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:34,580
You gonna be all right?

851
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:36,300
In time.

852
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:42,740
You know something? I haven't smoked
a cigarette in almost two days.

853
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:46,460
Maybe I'll quit.

854
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:51,260
I'll see ya.

855
01:22:09,020 --> 01:22:11,260
Shit.

856
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:13,220
Where's the key?

857
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:18,220
Oh, come on. Shit!

858
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:25,220
Lookin' for somethin'?

859
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:38,060
Ma?

860
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:52,340
Mom? Are you there?

861
01:23:03,740 --> 01:23:05,460
Devreux!

862
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:08,900
Devreux, can you
hear me? Nice farm.

863
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:11,780
Exactly like you
described it back in 'Nam.

864
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:15,260
Why don't you come out here and
join a little family reunion?

865
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:21,140
I mean, what the hell are you
waitin' for. farm boy? Are you deaf?

866
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:28,580
Get your ass out here!

867
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:31,540
We have some unfinished
business. you and me.

868
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:40,260
Wow! She really
has beautiful ears.

869
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:42,180
Sarge.

870
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:46,540
You want me? I'm
here. Let the girl go.

871
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:48,700
Don't tell me what
to do, soldier.

872
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:52,580
I give the orders around here, and
you're gonna have to learn that.

873
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:56,620
She's a fuckin' gook traitor.

874
01:23:56,700 --> 01:24:00,820
I gave you an order to kill her. Now you're
gonna have to fulfill that order. private.

875
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:04,380
Scott, the war...

876
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:06,380
is over.

877
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:09,540
Not for me.

878
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:15,100
Not for her. Not for you.

879
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:56,340
You can't run from
this war, soldier.

880
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:59,820
Not under my command, huh?

881
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:02,660
You've grown weak.

882
01:25:03,740 --> 01:25:06,620
You should've taken your...

883
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:09,220
medication.

884
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,660
Come on. Get up and fight.

885
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:02,540
Now I'm gonna teach you about
the chain of command, private.

886
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:07,060
When I say jump,

887
01:26:07,180 --> 01:26:11,060
you say, 'How high?'
Got it? Got it?

888
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:13,780
Why can't you get it
into your fucking head?

889
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:23,700
I gave you an order, soldier.

890
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:27,340
Now let me see you
waste that gook traitor.

891
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:35,740
Now where're we gonna
shoot her? In the stomach?

892
01:26:37,180 --> 01:26:39,540
Nah. In the chest?

893
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:45,500
No. I think we
should shoot her...

894
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:48,380
in the head!

895
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:52,220
Ready. Fire!

896
01:26:55,660 --> 01:26:58,580
It's empty!

897
01:26:58,660 --> 01:27:01,140
It's empty!

898
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:08,980
Luc!

899
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:11,060
Oh, God!

900
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:14,140
Oh, God, help!

901
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:16,740
Come on!

902
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:22,420
- Luc!
- Run!

903
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:24,740
No!

904
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:27,060
Run!

905
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:33,940
Run.

906
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:40,540
No!

907
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:18,900
Well, that's the
spirit, soldier.

908
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:36,220
I mean, this is a
serious matter. private.

909
01:28:36,340 --> 01:28:38,740
I can't believe you got your
poor folks involved in this too.

910
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:45,220
Well, I got a little secret for you,
boy. You're up for a court-martial.

911
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:50,060
- You ready to go to trial?
- Give me your best shot.

912
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:12,260
Gee, I'm awful sorry about this,
but you're all sentenced to death.

913
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:19,340
Say good night, asshole.

914
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:26,380
Good night, asshole.

915
01:30:49,740 --> 01:30:52,740
You're dead, soldier.

916
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:55,980
No. I'm alive.

917
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:18,540
You're discharged, Sarge.

918
01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:36,820
- Luc, son.
- You okay, Dad? Mom?

919
01:32:36,940 --> 01:32:38,780
Don't worry about us.

920
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:44,420
It's over, dear.

921
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:46,580
Here, let me help you.

922
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:15,380
Are you okay?

923
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:19,380
I have a- I have a little
bit of a headache, but-

924
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:28,780
- Where is he?
- Around.

925
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:32,060
How do you feel?

926
01:33:33,860 --> 01:33:36,420
Like a 50-year-old.
