So it's your fault.

No, it wasn't me, it was--

kind of things.

Now, let me tell you
how things are supposed to work.

166
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,560
The sun grows the food,
the ants pick the food,

167
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,520
the grasshoppers eat the food--

168
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,600
And the birds eat the grasshoppers.

appreciates that more than I do.
- Shut up!

176

There's still a few months

so you can all just try again.

183
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,640
But, Hopper, since it's
almost the rainy season,

184
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,880
we need this time
to gather food for ourselves.

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,680
touting your wares
as a talent scout,

599
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,400
preying upon the hungry souls
of hapless artistes.

600
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,320
Good day to you, sir.

601
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,560
Wait! No, no!
Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can't go.

602
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,160
You have got to help me. Give me
some time, I'll come up with a plan.

603
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:45,520
- Just go tell them the truth!
- They can't know the truth.
The truth, you see, is bad.

604
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,400
I will be branded for life.
My children's children will
walk down the street,

605
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:54,280
people will point and say, ''Look! There
goes the spawn of Flik, the loser!''

606
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,000
Oh-- oh, you know, all right, fine.
Yeah, okay. Just go.

607
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,560
But if you could just do me
a little favor before you leave.

608
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,280
If you could squish me,
that would be great, because, uh,

609
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,200
when they find out,
I'm as good as dead.

610

- [ Princess Atta ] Flik!
- [ Gasps ]

611
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,400
I really do think I should be
part of this meeting. Flik!

612
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,280
Aah! Princess Atta!
What a nice... surprise.

613
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,200
Just what exactly is going on?

614
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,920
I would like to speak
with the so-called ''warriors.''

615
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,960
You can't! They are in the middle
of a top secret meeting right now,

616
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,920
and they really should not
be disturbed... now.

00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Right, guys?

[ Gasps ] Could you ex-- pl--
Could you excuse me, please?

619
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,520
- Wait, wait, wait! Please, don't go!
- I'm not going anywhere.

00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,520
What is going on? Flik?

621
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,400
Flik! [ Groans ]
Ooh, I knew it!

622

- No!
- Quick, he's losin' it!

624
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,200
- You can't go! I'm desperate!
- Really? I couldn't tell.

625
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,400
Hmm. Come on, wings.

Help!

Mother,
Flik is up to something.

00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,560
Okay, Flik, time to put ya down.
Get him off me!

629
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,680
He's cutting off the circulation.

630
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,920
- No, no, no, no!
- Let go!

631
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,360
- Please, please, don't go!
- [ Rosie ] Put the stick down.
Flik, I mean it, now.

632
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,360
- Drop the stick.
- [ Screams ] Run!

Mr. Early Bird! How about
a nice, tasty worm on a stick?

I'm going to snap.
I'm going to snap.

you know. Come on.

- Thank you.

You? No.

Oh, good. Because, you see,

when you first brought them here,
I thought you'd hired a bunch of clowns.

Ya did?

Well, I haven't been that nice
to you, and... I'm sorry.

Hey! I know!

a great rapport with them,

it was very brave.

- Really? Naw, naw--
- Well, not every bug would face a bird.

- Yeah, well, I guess maybe I--

- Say that again?

Oh, oh, oh,

We can get rid of Hopper,
and no one has to know that I messed up.

00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,520
You just keep pretending
you're warriors.

Whoa, Flik, honey. We are not
about to fight grasshoppers, okay?

You'll be gone before the grasshoppers

in that little ant brain of yours,

but we'll have no part of it.

Oh! The bird went-- [ Whooshes ]
and it just missed you!

- And the way you pretended
to be stuck in that crack!

[ Chuckling ]
Oh, that's just all part of the plan.

That's Major Manny, young cadet.

00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:14,280
- I outrank everyone here. Remember that.
- Yes, sir!

00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,200
- Dismissed!
- Wow!

735
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,920
- When I grow up,
I'm gonna be a praying mantis!
- I'm gonna be a stick bug!

736
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,120
Oh, they're all so cool,
I can't pick!

737
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,200
[ Chuckling ] Delightful lads.
You were saying, Flik?

738
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,280
All right.
We are going to build a bird--

739
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:33,360
a bird that we can operate
from the inside, which would then be--

740
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,160
...hoisted above the anthill
and hidden high in the tree.

741
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,080
Then, right when Hopper
and his gang are below,

742
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:44,480
we'll launch the bird
and scare off the grasshoppers.

743
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,760
Now it's going to take
everyone's involvement--

744
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,040
...to make this plan

from anthill to anthill.

- I'm serious. Word of mouth got around.
- P.T.! No!

908
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,640
The next day, there was a line of flies
outside the tent went on forever!

00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,560
- It must have been a foot long!
- [ Rosie ] P.T., no!

910
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,800
So, I figured it out. You guys burn me
twice a night, I take a day off to heal,

911
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,720
and then we do it
all over again!

912
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:56,880
We'll be the top circus act
in the business! [ Guffaws ]

You mean, you're not warriors?

Are you kiddin'? These guys are the
lousiest circus bugs you've ever seen.

And they're gonna make me rich!
[ Chortling ]

You mean to tell me that
our entire defensive strategy...

00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,480
was concocted by clowns?

at a more inopportune time!

[ Dr.Flora ] We haven't collected
any food for the grasshoppers!

If Hopper finds out
what we almost did--

925
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,520
Hopper is not going
to find out.

926
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,920
We're going to hide all this,
and pretend it never happened.

You bugs were never here.
So I suggest you all leave.

But the bird!

00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:46,400
I never thought I'd see the day
when an ant would put himself...

- before the rest of his colony.
- What?

- No, no, no! I-I--

You lied, Flik. You lied to her.

You lied to the colony!
You lied to me!

And like an idiot,
I believed you.

- As far as I can tell
- He could be wrong about me

1349
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:04,520
- It's the time of your life
- Time, life

1350
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:08,160
- It's the time of your life
- Time, life

1351
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:11,120
It's the time of your life

1352
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:14,520
So live it well

1353
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:16,440
- [ Beeping ]
- Speed!
- Marker.

1354
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:19,680
- [ Director ] And-- action!
- Are you saying I'm stupid?

1355
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:22,880
- No!
- Do I look stupid... to you?

1356
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:25,040
[ Laughs Hysterically ]

1357
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:26,960
- I'm sorry!
- [ Beeping ]

1358
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:30,440
- Are you saying I'm stupid? Oh--
- [ Laughing ]

1359
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:36,960
- I'm sorry! I got it.
No, no. Do it again. I'm fine.
- [ Beeping ]

1360
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:40,840
- Are you saying I'm stupid?
- Yes! [ Laughing ]

1361
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:44,560
This is the 15th take.
I cannot work like this.

1362
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:47,880
- I will be in my trailer.
- I need a break.

1363
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,800
- [ Beeping ]
- Marker.

1364
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:52,960
- Whoa, Flik honey,
we are not about to--
- [ Banging ]

1365
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:54,880
- Is someone hammering?
- [ Sighs ]

1366
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,800
- Could we hold the work, please? People?
- [ Ringing ]

1367
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,760
Am I in this shot?
You can see me, right?

1368
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:01,280
- [ Beeping ]
- And-- action!

1369
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:04,160
To infinity, and beyond!

1370
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:08,320
- [ Laughing ]
- I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

1371
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,240
Really, can you blame me?

1372
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:13,560
- Okay, let's go for real now. Sorry.
- Okay, cut!

1373
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:16,160
Why go back to Ant Island at all?

1374
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:18,080
- I mean, you don't even like grain.
- What?

1375
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:20,000
You're right. I didn't think
it was such a good idea myself.

1376
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:22,040
- Actually, it wasn't
even my idea. It was--
- Watch it!

1377
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:24,400
- [ Crashing ]
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Is the camera broke?

1378
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:27,120
Oh, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry. Did I ruin the take?

1379
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:30,400
- [ Beeping ]
- And thank you for findin' 'em, Flik.

1380
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:32,480
Me? Oh, oops, ow, ow.

1381
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,520
- Ow, ow, ow!
- Uh, oh, oh no. Oh no, oh--

1382
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:37,360
- This really hurts, guys.
Can we cut? Ow!
- I'm sorry, I'm s-- Oh!

1383
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:38,800
[ Beeping ]

1384
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:42,080
So, is there a Mrs.Ant
you have to tunnel home to?

1385
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:45,440
Oh, I'm sorry!
I thought he was real.

1386
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:49,000
[ Laughing ] Ooh, dear.
Put that thing in my car.

1387
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:51,040
- [ Beeping ]
- Marker.

1388
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:53,400
Flik, after much deliberation--
[ Screaming ]

1389
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:56,800
- [ Rattling, Banging ]
- [ Laughing ]

1390
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:59,840
- [ Beeping ]
- Ohh, I-- Ow. Oh. My eye!

1391
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:02,440
Oh. No, no. Seriously,
I've got berry juice in my eye!

1392
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:05,200
- [ Laughing Fiendishly ]
- It stings! Stop acting. I'm serious.

1393
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,120
- Oh, stop the camera!
- [ Beeping ]

1394
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:09,440
- [ Laughing ]
- [ Gurgling, Liquid Trickling ]

1395
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:11,760
Uh-oh. Towel!
I need a towel over here!

1396
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,680
[ Laughing ]

1397
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,600
- [ Breaking Wind ]
- [ Director ] Cut!

1398
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:18,840
- [ Beeping ]
- [ Shrieking ] I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1399
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:22,680
- [ Groaning ]
- Can we-- Can we cut? It's just
I don't think I'm comin' across.

1400
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:25,920
Hmm. Oh, oh, I know. I know.
I could lather up a bunch of spit.

1401
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,760
Ooh, ooh, that's good.
I got it, J.L. One more for me.

1402
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:30,720
- [ Beeping ]
- Speed!
- Marker!

1403
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,160
Action!

1404
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:34,880
Spinning a web of safety
in less than 50-- Bleh!

1405
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:37,880
It's the time of your life

1406
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:39,800
So live it well

1407
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:45,080
It's the time of your life

1408
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:47,040
So live it well

1409
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:54,240
We may only go round one time

1410
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:57,000
As far as I can tell

1411
01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:00,080
It's the time of your life

1412
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:02,160
So live it well

1413
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:08,160
Like us all he started small

1414
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:10,080
Then he grew

1415
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:15,600
When the time came he knew

1416
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:17,520
What to do

1417
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:23,560
- He knew in order to succeed
- They'd have to work together

1418
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:27,240
- He turned a rock into a seed
- And they were changed forever

1419
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:29,520
Then they had the strength
they'd need

1420
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:34,120
- To get through stormy weather
- Do or die, you gotta try

1421
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:37,200
It's the time of your life

1422
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,120
So live it well

1423

01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:46,320
So live it well

1425
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:53,560
You may only go round one time

1426
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:56,520
- As far as I can tell
- You may be wrong about me

1427
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:59,600
It's the time of your life

1428
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:02,520
So live it well

1429
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:06,120
Isn't it a bit surprising

1430
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:09,840
How our fortunes ebb and flow

1431
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:13,600
And only to the enterprising

1432
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:17,840
Does the magic fortune cookie go

1433
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:21,760
Believe me
It's the time of your life

1434
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,680
So live it well

1435
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:28,440
It's the time of your life

1436
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:28,960
It's the time of your life

1437
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:31,080
So live it well

1438
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:38,080
We may only go round one time

1439
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:40,840
As far as I can tell

1440
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:43,440
It's the time of your life

1441
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:44,480
It's the time of your life

1442
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:48,240
It's the time of your life

1443
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:51,440
It's the time of your life

1444
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,760
So live it well
