1
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,116
Thirty-six hours ago,
an American B-52 bomber...

2
00:01:45,317 --> 00:01:48,013
...crashed into the Mediterranean Sea.

3
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,018
Moments before impact,
the bomber's crew jettisoned...

4
00:01:51,223 --> 00:01:53,885
...a 50-megaton nucIear warhead.

5
00:01:54,092 --> 00:01:56,617
The bomb capabIe of IeveIing
a major city...

6
00:01:56,828 --> 00:01:58,227
...has been Iost at sea.

7
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,196
Now underway is the greatest
navaI search in human history.

8
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:04,631
What do you think?
Should be you out there.

9
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:09,030
l'm the best diver in the Navy.

10
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:12,142
Hell, you ain't in the Navy.
You are a damned deserter.

11
00:02:12,344 --> 00:02:13,538
AWOL. AWOL.

12
00:02:13,745 --> 00:02:15,804
Years ago, a man
go on a bender like that...

13
00:02:16,415 --> 00:02:19,646
...they'd pin a medal on him
and take him for a blowjob.

14
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,353
lnstead, you got your ass kicked
by a couple of Marines.

15
00:02:28,093 --> 00:02:29,685
Ornery son of a bitch.

16
00:02:32,564 --> 00:02:33,622
Friend of yours.

17
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:36,993
Looks like chief here
is a nigger-lover.

18
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:43,133
Asshole, now you're going
to address me as master chief...

19
00:02:43,341 --> 00:02:45,832
...or l'll snap your goddamn wrist.
You read me?

20
00:02:46,044 --> 00:02:49,639
-You ain't a master chief no more.
-You trifling me, motherfucker?

21
00:02:50,348 --> 00:02:52,077
-Trifling me?
-Sorry, master chief!

22
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,647
Thank you!

23
00:02:57,189 --> 00:02:58,178
Carl.

24
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:52,236
Come on, Carl.

25
00:03:53,211 --> 00:03:56,442
Turn off Daddy's radio
and get ready for school.

26
00:04:12,998 --> 00:04:14,659
Come on, Jane.

27
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:18,797
Get ahold, John.

28
00:04:19,271 --> 00:04:21,296
Way to go, John.

29
00:04:23,775 --> 00:04:26,676
Come on. Come on!
Get up there, Jane. Come on.

30
00:04:26,878 --> 00:04:28,402
Come on. Good girl.

31
00:04:36,588 --> 00:04:37,577
Go, John.

32
00:04:39,024 --> 00:04:40,514
Move in, Jane.

33
00:04:43,662 --> 00:04:45,357
You best come in now.

34
00:04:46,264 --> 00:04:49,825
l told Doc Maddox
l'd be done by Friday and l will.

35
00:04:51,203 --> 00:04:54,331
-Daddy, you acting like--
-This was my farm?

36
00:04:55,273 --> 00:05:00,108
No, son. No matter how hard l work,
l ain't never gonna own this land.

37
00:05:00,812 --> 00:05:02,973
l heard you and Mama talking.

38
00:05:03,915 --> 00:05:06,816
You'll lose the farm
if this wheat ain't in on time.

39
00:05:07,485 --> 00:05:10,545
Doc Maddox'll bring in a family
where the kids work too.

40
00:05:16,995 --> 00:05:19,862
My kids go to school.

41
00:05:20,065 --> 00:05:22,295
Now go on before you're late.

42
00:05:32,444 --> 00:05:34,571
l'm not going to school, Daddy.

43
00:05:35,113 --> 00:05:38,742
Not today.
Not till this field is done.

44
00:05:39,284 --> 00:05:41,980
This field ain't ever gonna be done.

45
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,593
Today is Friday.

46
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,464
Come on. Good boy. Good girl.

47
00:05:57,669 --> 00:05:58,658
There you go.

48
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:02,772
Make me a promise.

49
00:06:03,508 --> 00:06:04,497
Sir?

50
00:06:07,345 --> 00:06:09,210
Don't end up like me.

51
00:06:20,825 --> 00:06:22,087
All right.

52
00:06:23,461 --> 00:06:24,951
Best get moving.

53
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,322
Rain coming in.

54
00:06:28,366 --> 00:06:30,596
Best get moving.
Ready, Jane, John.

55
00:06:30,802 --> 00:06:32,633
Get up there. Come on now.

56
00:06:33,805 --> 00:06:36,774
Stay the hoe, John.
Get the hoe, John.

57
00:06:41,646 --> 00:06:43,375
Get that hoe, Jane.

58
00:06:52,123 --> 00:06:54,057
Get the hoe, Jane!

59
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,825
Get up there!

60
00:07:06,338 --> 00:07:09,068
Come on, Carl. You'll miss the bus.

61
00:07:22,287 --> 00:07:25,518
Let's go, son.
Your father's waiting on us.

62
00:07:28,193 --> 00:07:30,388
The U.S. Navy is a big opportunity
for a young man.

63
00:07:30,595 --> 00:07:31,789
We got hot showers.

64
00:07:31,997 --> 00:07:36,229
We got three square meaIs a day,
unIike the Army....

65
00:07:36,434 --> 00:07:37,560
And l can keep this.

66
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:39,634
They're just giving it to me.

67
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,466
l wish l knew what l was gonna be.

68
00:07:42,674 --> 00:07:46,542
lKnowing you,
it's gonna be something big.

69
00:07:47,946 --> 00:07:51,040
He ain't said not one word
since we left the recruiter.

70
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:53,979
-He's just real scared for you.
-Coloreds now.

71
00:07:58,023 --> 00:08:00,321
-l love you.
-l love you.

72
00:08:07,065 --> 00:08:08,999
Recruiter say first leave's September.

73
00:08:09,534 --> 00:08:12,560
l wouldn't believe everything
that recruiter says.

74
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:16,673
Put it away for a rainy,
or send it home to Mom and Pop.

75
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,036
l'll come back, help mow the hay.

76
00:08:19,244 --> 00:08:22,213
Don't. Don't ever come back here.

77
00:08:24,382 --> 00:08:26,213
You get in there and fight, Carl.

78
00:08:26,885 --> 00:08:29,251
Don't take promises.

79
00:08:29,654 --> 00:08:32,214
Bust the old rules, if you have to.

80
00:08:33,258 --> 00:08:35,021
And when it gets hard...

81
00:08:37,295 --> 00:08:38,728
...and it will...

82
00:08:40,532 --> 00:08:41,931
...don't quit on me.

83
00:08:44,002 --> 00:08:45,162
Ever.

84
00:08:47,572 --> 00:08:49,563
Now, go on.

85
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,066
Don't come back here.

86
00:08:53,211 --> 00:08:54,803
Not for a long time.

87
00:09:17,535 --> 00:09:19,799
Charge it when you get
where you're going.

88
00:09:30,014 --> 00:09:32,482
''ASNF.''

89
00:09:32,684 --> 00:09:34,208
What's that supposed to mean?

90
00:09:39,591 --> 00:09:40,580
Come on, boy.

91
00:09:42,694 --> 00:09:45,185
You got a big future...

92
00:09:45,396 --> 00:09:48,126
...in the U.S. Navy.

93
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:51,225
A big future.

94
00:09:57,008 --> 00:09:59,499
Tell that recruiter,
to take his crystal ball...

95
00:09:59,711 --> 00:10:01,645
...and shove it directly up his ass.

96
00:10:01,946 --> 00:10:06,212
l just got back from fighting a war,
making the world free for democracy...

97
00:10:06,417 --> 00:10:10,410
...and they still got me slaving
over a hot grill next to you.

98
00:10:10,622 --> 00:10:13,989
There's only three choices
a colored man has in the Navy.

99
00:10:14,192 --> 00:10:15,420
-What, chief?
-A cook...

100
00:10:15,627 --> 00:10:17,652
-...officer's valet...
-Listening, Carl?

101
00:10:17,862 --> 00:10:20,057
...or getting the fuck out of the Navy.

102
00:10:20,632 --> 00:10:21,621
Big future.

103
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:25,535
-Big future, l'll be doggone.
-lt'll be all right.

104
00:10:32,477 --> 00:10:34,138
Hot, hot, hot.

105
00:10:36,414 --> 00:10:39,042
Hell ain't got nothing
on the South Pacific.

106
00:11:09,881 --> 00:11:11,075
Hold that.

107
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,181
Carl, what the hell are you doing?

108
00:11:14,786 --> 00:11:16,549
Reckon l'm gonna take a swim.

109
00:11:16,754 --> 00:11:19,120
Nigger, you're crazy.
Tuesday is colored swim--

110
00:11:19,324 --> 00:11:21,724
Well, l'm hot on Friday.

111
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,285
Those crackers see
that nappy head--

112
00:11:24,495 --> 00:11:26,986
What are they gonna do?
Make me wash more dishes?

113
00:11:31,436 --> 00:11:33,063
Someone's confused here.

114
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:34,829
Better get your ass off this deck.

115
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,435
Hey, it's not Tuesday, son.

116
00:11:37,642 --> 00:11:39,200
What the hell you doing, boy?

117
00:11:45,617 --> 00:11:47,084
Wrong day, asshole.

118
00:11:51,756 --> 00:11:53,348
All right, make way.

119
00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:00,620
Captain wants you back
on the boat now.

120
00:12:15,713 --> 00:12:16,907
-He'll beat you!
-Go, Carl!

121
00:13:14,372 --> 00:13:16,533
You got anything to say for yourself?

122
00:13:24,816 --> 00:13:26,511
Your response is noted.

123
00:13:33,157 --> 00:13:35,717
You ever hear
of the Search and Rescue Swimmers?

124
00:13:35,927 --> 00:13:39,727
-Sailor falls overboard, they--
-Dive in and save him. Yes, sir.

125
00:13:44,202 --> 00:13:45,533
You just became one.

126
00:13:46,938 --> 00:13:49,168
l'm transferring you to their unit.

127
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:55,706
You're the fastest swimmer on this
ship and have the balls to back it.

128
00:13:57,248 --> 00:14:00,115
Thank you, sir. l'll pack up
and report to the deck department--

129
00:14:00,318 --> 00:14:03,776
You're just there to swim,
nothing else.

130
00:14:04,155 --> 00:14:05,918
Stay with the stewards.

131
00:14:06,557 --> 00:14:07,546
Let him out.

132
00:14:10,027 --> 00:14:14,794
The only reason your ass ain't in the
brig is because you're high yellow.

133
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,065
Boy, you're in good
with Captain Pullman now.

134
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,738
Put in a good word for me
so l can drive the boat.

135
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:26,501
You won't beIieve it, but I made
seaman, which is a gIorified deckhand.

136
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:29,646
I'm not sure what I'II be,
but I'II make you proud of me.

137
00:14:29,847 --> 00:14:32,748
Dad, the maiI chopper's here,
so I better get topside.

138
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,681
Give Mom a big hug for me.
Your Ioving son, CarI.

139
00:14:42,326 --> 00:14:43,520
Afternoon, chief.

140
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,631
The mail chopper clipped a radiomast.
He's down!

141
00:14:58,843 --> 00:15:00,708
MaiI chopper portside.

142
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:07,047
Diver, now!
Tell him l want him up alive!

143
00:15:10,755 --> 00:15:11,779
Diver's coming up!

144
00:15:19,664 --> 00:15:20,790
Faster. Pull him up.

145
00:15:20,998 --> 00:15:22,898
Pull him up.
Faster! Faster!

146
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,762
Brashear, get on that steadying line.

147
00:15:27,038 --> 00:15:31,099
Lay back into it. lKeep it steady.
Steady.

148
00:15:38,549 --> 00:15:39,573
Bring him in.

149
00:15:49,961 --> 00:15:51,758
Let's get him up! On the hatch.

150
00:15:56,267 --> 00:15:57,359
Facedown.

151
00:16:18,956 --> 00:16:22,824
Goddamn! lf l'd been a few minutes
earlier, he'd be breathing now.

152
00:16:23,027 --> 00:16:25,860
You did your best, Chief Sunday.
Lieutenant Hanks.

153
00:16:26,964 --> 00:16:29,194
Complete the diving operation.

154
00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:32,933
The copilot is still in the water.

155
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,070
lt's your turn, bring him home.

156
00:16:35,606 --> 00:16:38,404
Take Chief Sunday to the chamber
for decompression.

157
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:47,384
Lay back. On the side.

158
00:16:48,152 --> 00:16:50,780
Diver coming up and over.

159
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,597
-Chief?
-Cut the weight. Drop the weight!

160
00:17:19,517 --> 00:17:21,417
-Man overboard.
-Stand by.

161
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:25,850
-What the hell's going on?
-We lost Caughlin, sir.

162
00:17:26,924 --> 00:17:29,791
-Standby's going in.
-We can't wait. Look at him.

163
00:17:29,994 --> 00:17:32,053
What are you doing?
l've got a man on.

164
00:17:32,263 --> 00:17:34,561
l'll bounce dive,
put him on a rescue line.

165
00:17:34,765 --> 00:17:37,563
-Bounce dive?
-l've done it before.

166
00:17:37,802 --> 00:17:40,828
You can't. He's too deep.
And you will call me ''sir''!

167
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:42,938
Goddamn it, l got a man dying, sir!

168
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,735
Give me a wrench, a spare lifeline
and an air hose!

169
00:17:47,612 --> 00:17:52,072
l've lost two men, another drowning.
l won't let you commit suicide.

170
00:17:52,283 --> 00:17:54,774
-Stand fast.
-He'll be dead before you get him!

171
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:56,112
-Sir, the air--
-Stand off!

172
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,814
You will lose if you touch that water.
Do you hear me?

173
00:18:01,025 --> 00:18:02,117
Yes, sir!

174
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,464
Goddamn it!

175
00:18:28,085 --> 00:18:32,681
Master Chief Sunday,
you sustained a serious embolism.

176
00:18:33,157 --> 00:18:34,146
Embolism.

177
00:18:34,358 --> 00:18:37,555
Both lobes of the lungs
were severely scarred.

178
00:18:37,862 --> 00:18:39,853
Can't cheat the laws
of nature forever.

179
00:18:40,064 --> 00:18:42,862
l'm afraid the condition
is totally inoperable.

180
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:45,495
Ain't that a bitch.

181
00:18:48,973 --> 00:18:52,272
So, what happens next time l dive
and take on pressure?

182
00:18:52,476 --> 00:18:55,707
Any increased pressure
at all will kill you instantly.

183
00:18:57,114 --> 00:19:00,311
lKill me? Goddamn. For a minute,
l thought this was serious.

184
00:19:00,518 --> 00:19:05,285
-lKeep your voice down.
-Hell, no. l feel like singing.

185
00:19:07,058 --> 00:19:08,423
-Fuck.
-Where are you going?

186
00:19:08,626 --> 00:19:12,619
To celebrate. You had me going.
l thought l couldn't dive no more.

187
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,628
-You're scaring the patients.
-How about me?

188
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:20,236
Goddamn! Hey, l got an idea.
Maybe you could use me around here.

189
00:19:20,438 --> 00:19:22,463
l'm looking to make a career move.

190
00:19:22,673 --> 00:19:26,632
Maybe you could get someone
to change the bedpans.

191
00:19:26,844 --> 00:19:28,709
Change the bedpans!

192
00:19:28,913 --> 00:19:30,175
Chief!

193
00:19:30,681 --> 00:19:32,979
Change a fucking bedpan!

194
00:19:38,189 --> 00:19:41,886
Master Chief Sunday, given
your current physical condition...

195
00:19:43,994 --> 00:19:48,522
...and the far graver issue
of recent acts of misconduct...

196
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:51,133
...you will be medically disqualified
from diving...

197
00:19:51,335 --> 00:19:53,269
...fined 1 /2 month's pay
for 3 months...

198
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,496
...and reassigned
to a training position...

199
00:19:55,706 --> 00:19:58,732
...where it is my greatest wish...

200
00:19:58,943 --> 00:20:02,811
...that you will embrace
a newfound respect for authority.

201
00:20:07,251 --> 00:20:08,741
This hearing is concluded.

202
00:20:42,753 --> 00:20:44,220
That's what l want to be, sir.

203
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:47,656
-A Navy master diver?
-Yes, sir.

204
00:20:48,058 --> 00:20:49,650
Last week, you were a cook.

205
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:54,194
-The man l just saw--
-The man you saw is a master chief.

206
00:20:54,532 --> 00:20:57,296
That's the highest rank in the Navy.

207
00:20:58,335 --> 00:21:00,963
Lot of good men spend
their career trying and fail.

208
00:21:01,472 --> 00:21:03,030
Besides...

209
00:21:03,841 --> 00:21:08,005
...they're not going to take a colored
at diving school. lt's that simple.

210
00:21:08,212 --> 00:21:10,806
What if you personally
recommended me, sir?

211
00:21:11,949 --> 00:21:15,112
l just made you a deck seaman
three days ago.

212
00:21:16,086 --> 00:21:17,951
What else do l owe you?

213
00:21:18,856 --> 00:21:20,380
The way l see it...

214
00:21:20,724 --> 00:21:23,192
...l owe you, sir.

215
00:21:30,868 --> 00:21:33,098
l'll endorse your request.

216
00:21:34,572 --> 00:21:36,403
But it ain't gonna work.

217
00:22:12,576 --> 00:22:13,736
Wait outside.

218
00:22:45,676 --> 00:22:49,373
Well, look at Mr. Navy.
Bell-bottoms bleached.

219
00:22:50,547 --> 00:22:52,344
Shoes all shined up.

220
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:54,779
Now all we need is an organ grinder.

221
00:22:55,352 --> 00:22:56,785
Welcome to Bayonne, New Jersey.

222
00:22:56,987 --> 00:22:58,511
Pimple on God's ass.

223
00:22:58,722 --> 00:23:01,122
Chief Sunday, we never met,
but l served with you.

224
00:23:02,927 --> 00:23:06,226
U.S.S. Hoist.
l expect l remember you now.

225
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:08,697
So, what's for chow, Cookie?

226
00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:11,763
l wouldn't know, chief.
l'm reporting for diving school.

227
00:23:12,136 --> 00:23:14,229
Oh, yeah, that's right.

228
00:23:14,505 --> 00:23:17,633
They say you wrote over 100 letters
requesting admission.

229
00:23:17,841 --> 00:23:19,433
You got you some grit, you have.

230
00:23:19,777 --> 00:23:20,766
Yes, sir.

231
00:23:22,646 --> 00:23:24,671
Fucking gonna be a hot one today.

232
00:23:30,521 --> 00:23:31,988
Hope you're better
than the last cook.

233
00:23:32,189 --> 00:23:34,054
Man's food could kill your dog.

234
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,452
Chief.

235
00:24:21,572 --> 00:24:23,335
Had anything to drink today?

236
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,700
No, sir, chief.

237
00:24:25,943 --> 00:24:28,434
Say we go into town
and get us a nice cold one.

238
00:24:28,846 --> 00:24:31,314
l can't do that, chief.
l haven't reported for duty.

239
00:24:31,682 --> 00:24:33,013
l'll tell you what.

240
00:24:33,217 --> 00:24:35,412
l'll buy you a tall one over there.

241
00:24:35,652 --> 00:24:37,051
A bus ticket too.

242
00:24:37,254 --> 00:24:39,882
So you can go on back to whatever
burrow you sprang from.

243
00:24:40,557 --> 00:24:41,922
What do you say?

244
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,657
Sir, l am a Navy man.

245
00:24:44,995 --> 00:24:47,259
Where l come from
there are no oceans...

246
00:24:47,464 --> 00:24:50,365
...only dirt farms and ornery mules.

247
00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:56,829
And no self-respecting Navy man
makes a living driving mules.

248
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,004
Sir.

249
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,419
You know what the Chinese say?

250
00:25:18,395 --> 00:25:20,454
Beware what you wish for.

251
00:25:25,035 --> 00:25:26,263
Let him in.

252
00:25:32,176 --> 00:25:33,837
l stole the pot!

253
00:25:42,953 --> 00:25:45,683
Get in. Hoist away.

254
00:26:02,406 --> 00:26:04,533
Don't stare at him.

255
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:08,107
-Who is he?
-Commanding officer.

256
00:26:08,312 --> 00:26:11,338
Everyone calls him Mr. Pappy.

257
00:26:11,548 --> 00:26:13,015
He's a war hero.

258
00:26:13,217 --> 00:26:15,685
They were going to make him an admiral
in D.C...

259
00:26:15,886 --> 00:26:19,947
...before they found out he has more
screws loose than a Studebaker.

260
00:26:20,157 --> 00:26:22,022
So they sent him here.

261
00:26:22,426 --> 00:26:26,294
Better salute him, or you'll spend
your first night in the brig.

262
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:35,495
l'll show you the barracks.

263
00:27:01,365 --> 00:27:02,696
Attention on deck!

264
00:27:11,675 --> 00:27:12,733
Gentlemen...

265
00:27:13,477 --> 00:27:18,005
...in 1 948, President Truman had
the courage and enlightenment...

266
00:27:18,215 --> 00:27:20,706
...to desegregate
the United States military.

267
00:27:21,451 --> 00:27:25,114
l want you to welcome Bayonne Diving
School's first colored trainee...

268
00:27:25,322 --> 00:27:28,120
...Boatswain's Mate Second Class
Carl Brashear.

269
00:27:33,697 --> 00:27:36,860
l don't hear anyone welcoming
Boatswain's Mate Brashear.

270
00:27:42,706 --> 00:27:44,173
Master chief.

271
00:27:44,441 --> 00:27:46,671
No disrespect to the president...

272
00:27:47,344 --> 00:27:49,107
...but l don't bunk with niggers.

273
00:29:02,986 --> 00:29:06,581
-Aren't you going to go too?
-No.

274
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:10,389
l'm from Wisconsin.

275
00:29:12,296 --> 00:29:13,593
Never been there.

276
00:29:44,227 --> 00:29:46,593
Rise and shine, Cookie.
Time for training.

277
00:29:52,703 --> 00:29:55,365
Are you familiar with the principle
of Boyle's Law?

278
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:57,101
The what?!

279
00:29:57,941 --> 00:29:59,932
l didn't hear your answer!

280
00:30:03,513 --> 00:30:05,413
Come on, Cookie. Get up.

281
00:30:07,017 --> 00:30:08,814
At a constant temperature...

282
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:13,388
...the volume of a confined gas
varies conversely with its pressure.

283
00:30:14,024 --> 00:30:16,219
Why is this law important in diving?

284
00:30:16,426 --> 00:30:17,484
l don't know, chief!

285
00:30:17,694 --> 00:30:20,857
That's because you're just
some dumb nigger from Podunk.

286
00:30:21,064 --> 00:30:25,194
l know you. Your smell hung
in every damn shack l ever lived in.

287
00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:28,067
Your face staring
when we had to leave...

288
00:30:28,271 --> 00:30:31,206
...because your daddy
could farm it cheaper than mine.

289
00:30:31,408 --> 00:30:34,241
He drank himself into a $ 7 casket,
but not me!

290
00:30:34,978 --> 00:30:36,502
Because l'm a master diver!

291
00:30:36,713 --> 00:30:38,544
Maybe you'll remember that
next time...

292
00:30:38,749 --> 00:30:42,617
...you imply we got anything
in common. You read me, Cookie?

293
00:30:46,757 --> 00:30:50,193
Get your goddamn Wisconsin ass
back to bed, Snowhill!

294
00:31:21,091 --> 00:31:22,752
The men you are watching...

295
00:31:23,193 --> 00:31:25,252
...are going to be Navy divers.

296
00:31:25,662 --> 00:31:28,688
You bottom suckers are not fit
to observe them.

297
00:31:28,899 --> 00:31:30,298
Avert your eyes!

298
00:31:31,134 --> 00:31:33,796
My name is Master Chief Billy Sunday.

299
00:31:34,204 --> 00:31:37,105
There was a preacher by the same name
who rid Chicago...

300
00:31:37,307 --> 00:31:40,902
...of the whoring spics, drunken wops
and motherfucking niggers...

301
00:31:41,111 --> 00:31:44,911
...who were making that place unfit
for decent white folks to live.

302
00:31:45,749 --> 00:31:48,547
The only difference
between me and that preacher...

303
00:31:48,752 --> 00:31:52,119
...is that he worked for God,
and l am God!

304
00:31:55,258 --> 00:31:58,455
Now, the first 10 of you
Girl Scouts step forward.

305
00:31:59,563 --> 00:32:01,497
Come on, drop your dicks!
Let's go!

306
00:32:04,134 --> 00:32:08,901
Three-quarters of you standing here
will fail to become Navy divers.

307
00:32:09,105 --> 00:32:11,164
Three from the first row,
step forward.

308
00:32:11,374 --> 00:32:12,500
Step forward!

309
00:32:15,812 --> 00:32:20,613
Of those unfortunates who pass, only
three of you will live to retirement.

310
00:32:20,817 --> 00:32:24,150
Because diving is
the most dangerous job in the Navy.

311
00:32:25,489 --> 00:32:27,354
So who wants to quit?

312
00:32:27,858 --> 00:32:29,917
Say now, who wants to quit?

313
00:32:30,427 --> 00:32:31,860
You got something to offer?

314
00:32:36,433 --> 00:32:38,799
Who wants to save me the sweat...

315
00:32:39,002 --> 00:32:41,562
...of training your sorry ass?

316
00:32:41,771 --> 00:32:42,669
You?

317
00:32:43,273 --> 00:32:44,399
You?

318
00:32:44,841 --> 00:32:46,103
Cookie?

319
00:32:50,881 --> 00:32:51,939
You?

320
00:32:53,783 --> 00:32:55,478
You gonna look me in the eye?

321
00:32:57,954 --> 00:33:00,388
What are you, some broke-dick Popeye?

322
00:33:03,994 --> 00:33:07,191
Let me guess.
You were captain of the swim team.

323
00:33:07,397 --> 00:33:11,128
You and your girlfriend used
to practice the breaststroke!

324
00:33:16,172 --> 00:33:17,935
Say it like you got a pair!

325
00:33:18,275 --> 00:33:20,175
My wife.

326
00:33:20,377 --> 00:33:23,471
lt's in your record.
You knocked her up sophomore year.

327
00:33:24,781 --> 00:33:28,182
Maybe you can bring
the little woman down one night...

328
00:33:28,385 --> 00:33:32,185
...and all the boys can practice
the breaststroke.

329
00:33:34,224 --> 00:33:38,456
l heard you were a hell of a swimmer,
Snowhill. State champ?

330
00:33:38,662 --> 00:33:41,426
Yes, yes, master chief.

331
00:33:45,602 --> 00:33:47,900
Snowhill, please step forward.

332
00:33:48,104 --> 00:33:49,093
March.

333
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:52,030
About face.

334
00:33:57,881 --> 00:34:00,941
You let go before l relieve you,
you fail my course.

335
00:34:01,151 --> 00:34:02,743
Got it, swim champ?

336
00:34:10,527 --> 00:34:14,258
Swimming don't got dick-shit
to do with deep-sea diving.

337
00:34:14,464 --> 00:34:18,992
lf Johnny Weissmuller were in the soup
wearing a 200-pound diving rig...

338
00:34:19,202 --> 00:34:23,866
...he couldn't swim to fuck Esther
Williams if she was right there naked.

339
00:34:24,074 --> 00:34:26,542
The only way to survive
is to trust each other.

340
00:34:26,743 --> 00:34:28,768
Underwater, all you got
is the man next to you.

341
00:34:28,979 --> 00:34:33,678
That's why the only men to get through
my course are the very, very best.

342
00:34:34,284 --> 00:34:35,876
Now get out of my sight.

343
00:34:47,397 --> 00:34:49,422
Permission to relieve the man below.

344
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,828
What are you, Cookie?
Some kind of goddamn hero?

345
00:34:53,136 --> 00:34:57,971
l got no room for heroes or stuttering
swim champs with a wife and kids.

346
00:34:58,174 --> 00:35:01,439
Flunk me. But don't punish
him for being decent to me.

347
00:35:01,645 --> 00:35:04,079
You'll flunk all on your own.

348
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,009
Swim champ had half a chance.

349
00:35:06,216 --> 00:35:08,707
He still does.
Permission to relieve him.

350
00:35:08,918 --> 00:35:10,977
Says he can hold his breath
for 4 minutes.

351
00:35:11,187 --> 00:35:12,449
Ain't even been two.

352
00:35:14,024 --> 00:35:16,424
l believe
Gunner's Mate Snowhill's a liar!

353
00:35:16,626 --> 00:35:19,618
We're men of honor, ain't we?
We don't abide liars.

354
00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:22,229
You're out of my program, Snowhill!

355
00:35:22,565 --> 00:35:25,033
Brashear, you have the barracks
to yourself.

356
00:35:28,371 --> 00:35:29,429
Damn!

357
00:35:30,407 --> 00:35:33,843
The Navy diver is not a fighting man
but a salvage expert.

358
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:35,636
lf it's lost, he finds it.

359
00:35:35,845 --> 00:35:38,939
lf it's sunk, he brings it up.
lf it's in the way, he moves it.

360
00:35:39,149 --> 00:35:42,346
lf he's lucky, he'll die 200 feet
beneath the waves.

361
00:35:42,552 --> 00:35:44,645
That's the closest he'll get
to being a hero.

362
00:35:44,854 --> 00:35:48,290
Hell, l don't know why anybody'd want
to be a Navy diver.

363
00:35:49,325 --> 00:35:50,656
Good flange work, Rourke.

364
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,885
-Almost there.
-Thank you, master chief.

365
00:36:01,671 --> 00:36:03,662
Machinist's Mate Rourke, 91 .

366
00:36:03,873 --> 00:36:07,036
Boatswain's Mate Brashear, 37.

367
00:36:08,278 --> 00:36:11,679
-You fail the next test, you're out.
-Yes, sir.

368
00:36:12,148 --> 00:36:16,244
There are seats of learning beyond
the walls and control of this camp.

369
00:36:22,692 --> 00:36:25,923
Ladies, this is weekend liberty.

370
00:36:26,663 --> 00:36:31,259
Anyone who ain't back here on time
will have to answer to me personally.

371
00:36:31,468 --> 00:36:34,835
And remember: One-night stands
may be over by morning...

372
00:36:35,038 --> 00:36:37,700
...but syphilis lasts a lifetime.

373
00:36:37,907 --> 00:36:39,841
Dismissed!

374
00:36:58,027 --> 00:37:01,394
Hey! Hey! How about some flowers
for your young lady?

375
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,772
What's the hitch?

376
00:37:24,587 --> 00:37:26,714
-You're the one who called.
-Yes, ma'am.

377
00:37:27,757 --> 00:37:32,126
l told you. We're a public library,
not a tutoring service.

378
00:37:32,862 --> 00:37:35,023
Now if you don't mind...

379
00:37:35,231 --> 00:37:38,132
...there is a Mr. Biddle at home.

380
00:37:38,334 --> 00:37:40,734
ln fact,
he's probably brought flowers.

381
00:37:55,518 --> 00:37:57,076
Have a wonderful weekend.

382
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,212
And lock up, would you?

383
00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:01,848
And be sure to kick him out.

384
00:38:03,726 --> 00:38:04,886
Hello.

385
00:38:06,629 --> 00:38:07,823
We're closed.

386
00:38:08,631 --> 00:38:10,189
Not for three minutes.

387
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,658
You studying on nursing?

388
00:38:12,969 --> 00:38:15,870
A person doesn't study ''on'' anything,
boatswain's mate.

389
00:38:18,808 --> 00:38:22,437
You know your rates and ranks.
Did you get that from these books?

390
00:38:25,148 --> 00:38:27,981
Look, l am not here to flirt with you.

391
00:38:28,918 --> 00:38:30,852
l'm in diving school
across the river.

392
00:38:31,254 --> 00:38:34,018
l'm not just good at it.
l was born for it.

393
00:38:34,791 --> 00:38:37,817
But the joke is, l'll wash out
if l fail my next exam.

394
00:38:38,094 --> 00:38:40,324
What's the last grade you completed?

395
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:41,519
Seventh.

396
00:38:42,232 --> 00:38:43,961
-l can't help you.
-Why not?

397
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:48,160
lt took me four years of work
to get through med school.

398
00:38:48,371 --> 00:38:50,430
Now l have six weeks
to study for my exam.

399
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,474
l pass, l become an intern,
maybe someday a doctor.

400
00:38:54,711 --> 00:38:58,238
You're too far behind.
And l don't have the time.

401
00:38:58,882 --> 00:39:00,008
Okay. Go on.

402
00:39:00,283 --> 00:39:02,979
Go read to yourself.
Don't give me another thought.

403
00:39:03,186 --> 00:39:06,314
Don't you get it?
lt doesn't matter if l help you.

404
00:39:06,522 --> 00:39:08,956
-You're gonna fail anyway.
-l won't.

405
00:39:11,194 --> 00:39:12,252
l can't.

406
00:39:14,864 --> 00:39:16,889
Why do you want this so badly?

407
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,268
Because they said l couldn't have it.

408
00:39:39,656 --> 00:39:42,989
l may know a professor at City....

409
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:34,269
Boyle's Law describes the behavior
of gases under varying pressure.

410
00:40:34,477 --> 00:40:38,174
lt states if a diver holds
his breath at 100 feet...

411
00:40:38,381 --> 00:40:40,576
...continues holding while rising
to 10 feet...

412
00:40:40,883 --> 00:40:43,909
...the gases in his lungs
increase four times.

413
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:48,352
Why is this important? Forget to
exhale going up, your lungs explode.

414
00:40:52,428 --> 00:40:55,864
l can work with you,
but my time is precious.

415
00:40:56,065 --> 00:41:00,866
So the first time you go drinking
and fighting and leave me waiting...

416
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,628
...our arrangement ends.

417
00:41:07,243 --> 00:41:08,505
Good morning.

418
00:41:19,756 --> 00:41:21,348
l...

419
00:41:22,692 --> 00:41:24,057
...have to open up.

420
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,194
What's your name? Or is it a secret?

421
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:29,061
My name is Jo.

422
00:41:32,068 --> 00:41:34,593
My father always wanted a boy.

423
00:41:36,339 --> 00:41:38,239
He was in the Navy too.

424
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:39,633
ls he still active?

425
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:42,805
l haven't seen him since l was 9.

426
00:42:06,702 --> 00:42:08,067
Good night.

427
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,733
Fire Controlman Mellegrano, 91 .

428
00:42:12,942 --> 00:42:14,603
Mate DuBoyce, 85.

429
00:42:14,811 --> 00:42:17,746
Engineman Crofoot, 69.

430
00:42:17,947 --> 00:42:20,142
Boatswain's Mate Carl Brashear...

431
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:23,113
...76.

432
00:42:32,361 --> 00:42:36,058
Boots, Cookie, square away, ladies.
You're next in the water.

433
00:42:36,265 --> 00:42:40,326
Patch the hull of the training vessel
so we can pump her full of air...

434
00:42:40,536 --> 00:42:42,060
...and raise her up.

435
00:42:42,271 --> 00:42:44,637
Then we'll sink her and do it again.

436
00:42:51,781 --> 00:42:52,839
What's going on?

437
00:42:53,049 --> 00:42:55,483
He stays down any longer,
he'll get mail.

438
00:43:04,594 --> 00:43:06,221
lsert, finish torching that hole.

439
00:43:06,429 --> 00:43:09,296
l'm trying,
but this thing's real awkward.

440
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,330
-How's it look?
-Looks like hell.

441
00:43:14,203 --> 00:43:18,537
Green diver, you have three minutes
to get your patch hung...

442
00:43:18,741 --> 00:43:22,438
...before the next team comes.
Move your raggedy ass, Isert.

443
00:43:22,645 --> 00:43:24,408
-Red diver.
-Yes, master chief.

444
00:43:24,614 --> 00:43:29,551
Goddamn, I've had girIfriends who
couId weId faster. Move him aIong.

445
00:43:30,486 --> 00:43:33,944
-Come on, lsert, hang the patch.
-Yeah, okay, Rourke. l'm trying.

446
00:43:41,164 --> 00:43:42,324
Do you feel that?

447
00:43:42,732 --> 00:43:44,427
Do l feel what?

448
00:43:45,568 --> 00:43:46,967
What the hell?

449
00:43:48,804 --> 00:43:50,431
This wreck is rolling!

450
00:43:52,508 --> 00:43:54,908
She's limping, chief.
We're sliding down.

451
00:43:55,111 --> 00:43:57,272
Can somebody tell me what happened?

452
00:43:58,014 --> 00:43:59,606
Come on! Grab that hose!

453
00:44:14,664 --> 00:44:18,327
-Red diver, what's your situation?
-The whole ship just dropped 50 feet.

454
00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:19,523
We landed on something.

455
00:44:19,735 --> 00:44:21,896
Bring them home
so we can figure this out.

456
00:44:22,104 --> 00:44:23,366
You're coming home.

457
00:44:23,606 --> 00:44:27,406
Negative on the come-home order.
lsert's air hose is tangled.

458
00:44:28,744 --> 00:44:30,041
My air hose is stuck!

459
00:44:30,279 --> 00:44:32,645
FouIed. Now get it unfouIed.

460
00:44:35,885 --> 00:44:39,013
Rourke, what's wrong?
Why are we moving?

461
00:44:39,222 --> 00:44:41,053
We slipped down the channel bank.

462
00:44:45,661 --> 00:44:48,289
This wreck is alive.

463
00:44:48,497 --> 00:44:51,364
-l have to change out his air hose.
-Listen, Rourke...

464
00:44:51,567 --> 00:44:54,695
...he's your buddy.
Unfoul his line and get him out.

465
00:44:54,904 --> 00:44:57,270
l'm trying, it's too tight.
Send down a line.

466
00:44:59,742 --> 00:45:00,731
Help!

467
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:04,402
-Chief, I need heIp.
-Stay put. Help's on the way.

468
00:45:04,614 --> 00:45:05,911
-l'm ready.
-Undress him.

469
00:45:06,215 --> 00:45:09,514
-You can't go down there.
-l won't have your familiar tone.

470
00:45:11,854 --> 00:45:13,287
You can't dive that deep.

471
00:45:14,123 --> 00:45:15,249
l'm ready. Let me go.

472
00:45:23,332 --> 00:45:24,356
Master chief...

473
00:45:24,767 --> 00:45:29,397
...it looks like the ship slid down on
some pipes coming from that factory.

474
00:45:29,605 --> 00:45:33,302
They give out, this whole ship's going
right to the bottom.

475
00:45:33,843 --> 00:45:36,835
Don't worry about the boat.
Get that hose to Rourke.

476
00:45:45,488 --> 00:45:48,252
-For God's sakes!
-What the heII is that, Cookie?

477
00:45:49,558 --> 00:45:52,220
The ship's weight is busting
those pipes, chief.

478
00:45:52,662 --> 00:45:55,096
We got to get him on a fresh hose
and out of here.

479
00:45:56,332 --> 00:45:59,597
Topside, blue diver is here.
He's got a fresh line.

480
00:45:59,802 --> 00:46:03,568
Isert, Rourke wiII change you out,
and you'II waIk out of there.

481
00:46:03,773 --> 00:46:06,674
Rourke, he's got five
minutes of air if he don't panic.

482
00:46:06,942 --> 00:46:10,070
-You screw up and he's dead, read me?
-Yes, master chief.

483
00:46:10,279 --> 00:46:13,840
Isert, we can't taIk for a bit,
think of your favorite song...

484
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:15,415
...and l want you to sing it.

485
00:46:15,685 --> 00:46:17,084
l don't know any songs!

486
00:46:17,286 --> 00:46:20,517
You have to sIow your respiration.
Breathe easy.

487
00:46:20,723 --> 00:46:23,157
Please, l wasn't made for this!

488
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,886
l want to go home now!
l want to go home now!

489
00:46:27,096 --> 00:46:28,961
Would you let me go home now?

490
00:46:29,432 --> 00:46:30,262
l want to quit!

491
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,334
I want to quit!
I reaIIy want to quit!

492
00:46:33,536 --> 00:46:35,197
l want to quit!

493
00:46:35,404 --> 00:46:36,894
Change him out now!

494
00:46:39,742 --> 00:46:42,711
-She's moving!
-Come on, Rourke.

495
00:46:44,447 --> 00:46:46,347
Oh, fuck!

496
00:46:49,352 --> 00:46:51,320
Topside, lsert's off air.

497
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:57,256
-What is going on?
-She's gonna roll over!

498
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:00,896
l expect so. Now stay there
and change that boy out, you hear me?

499
00:47:04,934 --> 00:47:06,993
l'm out of here. l have to get out.

500
00:47:07,636 --> 00:47:10,161
-She's going down.
-Come back here!

501
00:47:10,606 --> 00:47:14,167
-Rourke, get back here!
-l ain't dying. l'm out of here!

502
00:47:14,377 --> 00:47:17,869
Don't leave!
Carl, don't leave me.

503
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:21,140
l need my air hose.
l can't breathe, Carl.

504
00:47:22,017 --> 00:47:23,848
l'm getting dizzy.

505
00:47:49,712 --> 00:47:51,304
l can't breathe.

506
00:48:07,463 --> 00:48:10,796
-Topside, he's blacking out.
-Goddamn it, hook him up!

507
00:48:35,991 --> 00:48:38,221
-We're coming home, chief.
-Never doubted it.

508
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:12,458

Miserable son of a bitch,

00:53:21,408 --> 00:53:22,397
Sorry to hear that.

532
00:53:32,453 --> 00:53:34,648
You know he'll kick you out
of the Navy.

533
00:53:40,994 --> 00:53:42,757
He's gonna kick you out of diving.

534
00:53:49,203 --> 00:53:51,228
What're you gonna do about it?

535
00:53:52,539 --> 00:53:55,702
Let him run you over,
like you do everyone else?

536
00:54:01,582 --> 00:54:03,447
You know he's in there right now.

537
00:54:07,221 --> 00:54:11,055
He wanted a party.
Let's give him one.

538
00:54:16,163 --> 00:54:20,793
She told me it was okay
to dance with girls.

539
00:54:27,875 --> 00:54:29,843
l love this song.

540
00:54:40,454 --> 00:54:41,443
Donny...

541
00:54:42,022 --> 00:54:44,490
...be a dear lad
and get us two Scotches.

542
00:54:44,858 --> 00:54:45,847
We're out.

543
00:54:46,493 --> 00:54:49,519
Lucky for us you got a whole bar
full of bourbon.

544
00:55:01,008 --> 00:55:02,873
What the hell you doing with him?

545
00:55:07,948 --> 00:55:09,176
Get out.

546
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:11,845
Well, l'll be goddamned.

547

lt's prom night at the Moor Bar.

548
00:55:15,322 --> 00:55:18,291
You boys have a drink on me.
Go ahead.

549
00:55:22,896 --> 00:55:25,262
Hell, l don't know who classes up
the joint more:

550
00:55:25,466 --> 00:55:28,833
The fetching young lady
in the fur stole or Cookie here.

551
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:32,962
So, what did you two kids come here
to do anyway? Dance?

552
00:55:34,107 --> 00:55:37,804
Why not take a turn?
lt's a free country. Mostly.

553
00:55:38,245 --> 00:55:40,338
You made a big mistake walking
in here.

554
00:55:41,815 --> 00:55:44,443
-lt's my fault.
-lt's all your fault.

555
00:55:44,885 --> 00:55:48,719
Spoiled little girl gets her kicks
dragging stray men in here.

556
00:55:49,022 --> 00:55:52,480
Thinks we're a bunch of rednecks
she can shake up for fun.

557
00:55:53,827 --> 00:55:54,816
Hey, Donny...

558
00:55:55,128 --> 00:55:58,757
...be a dear lad and bring the lady
a fresh soldier.

559
00:56:00,367 --> 00:56:02,335
Think you deserve to be here?

560
00:56:02,536 --> 00:56:03,935
Fraternizing among Navy men?

561
00:56:05,639 --> 00:56:07,300
Think you're as good as them?

562
00:56:08,141 --> 00:56:09,631
And me? You better than me?

563
00:56:09,843 --> 00:56:11,037
Damn right l am.

564
00:56:18,585 --> 00:56:19,847
See this pipe?

565
00:56:21,221 --> 00:56:25,021
General MacArthur himself
smoked this pipe.

566
00:56:25,225 --> 00:56:27,250
l served with him at Leyte Gulf.

567
00:56:27,561 --> 00:56:29,529
Biggest naval battle in history.

568
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:32,965
lKamikaze ripped into an escort
carrier, the Saint Lo.

569
00:56:33,433 --> 00:56:37,870
Went down on a shallow reef, trapped
me and six boys in the fire room.

570
00:56:38,672 --> 00:56:41,436
-Only one way out.
-Flood the compartment, swim up.

571
00:56:41,742 --> 00:56:45,576
Five decks, Cookie.
Five fucking decks.

572
00:56:45,779 --> 00:56:48,543
Locked bulkheads.
Dead bodies everywhere.

573
00:56:48,749 --> 00:56:52,116
You got to have your balls screwed
on tight for that swim.

574
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:56,416
We still had intercom. Old MacArthur
came over that squawk box:

575
00:56:56,623 --> 00:57:00,957
''Sunday, you son of a bitch, l bet you
can't hold your breath four minutes...

576
00:57:01,161 --> 00:57:04,096
...and swim out of there.''
lKnow what l said?

577
00:57:05,799 --> 00:57:07,289
''No, Mac, l can't...

578
00:57:07,501 --> 00:57:11,028
...but l'll bet you your cob pipe
l can hold it for five...

579
00:57:11,238 --> 00:57:13,297
...because that's what it'll take.''

580
00:57:13,707 --> 00:57:16,141
-This ain't worth it.
-Get your hands off me.

581
00:57:16,343 --> 00:57:20,040
Six men are breathing today
because l let them out of that room.

582
00:57:20,847 --> 00:57:22,576
Now because you pulled...

583
00:57:22,783 --> 00:57:25,343
...lsert's white ass out
of some rowboat...

584
00:57:25,552 --> 00:57:27,918
...you think you're better than me?

585
00:57:28,121 --> 00:57:30,055
Well, let's just see.

586
00:57:37,464 --> 00:57:39,295
What's your bet, Cookie?

587
00:57:41,335 --> 00:57:42,597
Put Snowhill back in.

588
00:57:43,503 --> 00:57:45,630
-What do you owe him?
-Nothing. You do.

589
00:57:45,872 --> 00:57:47,806
Oh, yeah? Fine.

590
00:57:48,008 --> 00:57:51,705
But if l win, you ship out tonight.
Deal?

591
00:57:55,869 --> 00:57:56,927
Deal.

592
00:57:58,104 --> 00:58:00,004
Show him, master chief.

593
00:58:02,375 --> 00:58:04,468
-Will you be my tender?
-Yeah.

594
00:58:33,707 --> 00:58:34,935
Go, baby.

595
00:58:37,744 --> 00:58:38,733
Come on now.

596
00:58:44,417 --> 00:58:45,645
Go, Sunday!

597
00:58:50,657 --> 00:58:51,681
Go.

598
00:58:53,693 --> 00:58:55,456
Go, Master Chief Sunday!

599
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:12,870
One minute, fifteen seconds.

600
00:59:38,438 --> 00:59:41,202
Two minutes, twenty-five seconds.

601
00:59:42,075 --> 00:59:44,270
Ten bucks right here!

602
00:59:57,223 --> 00:59:59,350
Three minutes, ten seconds!

603
01:00:14,808 --> 01:00:16,139
Four minutes.

604
01:00:19,846 --> 01:00:21,939
-Stop it.
-Chief?

605
01:00:36,262 --> 01:00:37,456
Rourke, stop it.

606
01:00:46,573 --> 01:00:49,872
Carl, are you okay? Carl?

607
01:00:54,247 --> 01:00:55,214
Chief, are you okay?

608
01:00:55,415 --> 01:00:57,383
-Hold it.
-You all right, chief?

609
01:00:57,584 --> 01:00:58,846
l'm okay.

610
01:00:59,385 --> 01:01:00,647
Hold him up.

611
01:01:09,829 --> 01:01:10,921
Let's go!

612
01:01:11,131 --> 01:01:13,531
She tried to drive off the pier.

613
01:01:14,334 --> 01:01:15,767
Get her out of the car.

614
01:01:19,305 --> 01:01:22,172
Today's my wedding anniversary.

615
01:01:24,677 --> 01:01:26,406
Come on, move. Move.

616
01:01:27,814 --> 01:01:30,908
No, not you, Billy.

617
01:01:31,117 --> 01:01:32,482
Not you.

618
01:01:33,286 --> 01:01:34,753
Bastard!

619
01:01:35,822 --> 01:01:37,983
Come on, baby. Let's go home.

620
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:44,523
-Come on, baby. Let's go home.
-Yeah.

621
01:01:46,399 --> 01:01:49,163
Go on home now.
Nothing to see here.

622
01:01:52,272 --> 01:01:53,261
Jo.

623
01:01:58,845 --> 01:02:02,781
l can't do this, Carl.
l can't live this life again.

624
01:02:03,683 --> 01:02:06,345
l pulled my father out
of too many Navy bars.

625
01:02:06,853 --> 01:02:09,617
-You don't know what happened tonight.
-Oh, but l do.

626
01:02:14,761 --> 01:02:16,558
l passed my finals.

627
01:02:17,197 --> 01:02:18,357
l'm sorry.

628
01:02:18,565 --> 01:02:19,930
l'm sorry, Jo.

629
01:02:20,133 --> 01:02:22,966
l'm going to be starting
my internship at Bellevue.

630
01:02:23,169 --> 01:02:25,763
lt'll be crazy.
l won't have time to see you.

631
01:02:26,072 --> 01:02:29,371
-lt won't happen again.
-Yes, it will.

632
01:02:29,576 --> 01:02:34,013
You wanted to fight that man.
You were waiting for the moment.

633
01:02:35,515 --> 01:02:39,645
Don't you see? l'm not like you?

634
01:02:41,187 --> 01:02:43,212
The things l want....

635
01:02:45,825 --> 01:02:49,158
The things l want are smaller.

636
01:02:50,063 --> 01:02:52,588
lf l just work hard
and keep my head down--

637
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:54,664
Your whole life will pass you by.

638
01:03:05,044 --> 01:03:09,276
Most of what's in those diving books
you know better than me.

639
01:03:09,482 --> 01:03:11,677
You don't need me.
You don't need anyone.

640
01:03:14,053 --> 01:03:15,577
l love you.

641
01:03:38,511 --> 01:03:39,603
Jo!

642
01:03:41,281 --> 01:03:42,407
Marry me, Jo!

643
01:03:45,084 --> 01:03:46,073
What?

644
01:03:49,722 --> 01:03:51,883
He wants to know if you'll marry him.

645
01:04:23,957 --> 01:04:25,015
Come in.

646
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:28,627
Watch the door.
Try not to touch anything.

647
01:05:04,797 --> 01:05:07,789
Did you know that ordinary
house dust is composed...

648
01:05:08,001 --> 01:05:11,061
...primarily of human skin?

649
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:14,939
No, sir, l didn't know that.

650
01:05:16,309 --> 01:05:20,177
Makes you think twice
about who you invite into your home.

651
01:05:31,290 --> 01:05:35,784
Two tablespoons of machine oil
can contaminate...

652
01:05:36,696 --> 01:05:38,960
...an entire ship's...

653
01:05:39,532 --> 01:05:41,830
...fresh water supply.

654
01:05:43,703 --> 01:05:47,537
Some things just don't mix.

655
01:05:49,275 --> 01:05:50,572
Do they...

656
01:05:50,977 --> 01:05:52,137
...chief?

657
01:05:54,847 --> 01:05:56,371
He's gonna pass.

658
01:05:57,316 --> 01:06:00,774
Yesterday, he scored a 94
on his final.

659
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:03,055
He don't have to be fast tomorrow.

660
01:06:03,256 --> 01:06:06,225
All he's got to do
is complete the exercise.

661
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:12,458
Billy...

662
01:06:18,971 --> 01:06:22,463
...there may come a day when
a colored diver graduates from here...

663
01:06:22,675 --> 01:06:26,634
...but it won't be tomorrow,
or as long as l'm here.

664
01:06:28,514 --> 01:06:30,846
You agree with me, of course.

665
01:06:33,086 --> 01:06:34,178
Don't you, chief?

666
01:06:35,321 --> 01:06:36,515
Yes, sir.

667
01:07:12,825 --> 01:07:14,452
Baseball season's over.

668
01:07:17,163 --> 01:07:18,391
l figured Rourke.

669
01:07:18,598 --> 01:07:20,088
l never let myself think--

670
01:07:20,299 --> 01:07:23,268
-Why not?
-Because l saw your last dive.

671
01:07:25,938 --> 01:07:27,599
You want to know what l am?

672
01:07:27,807 --> 01:07:31,265
l'm the sorry son of a bitch
put here to get through your skull...

673
01:07:31,477 --> 01:07:33,707
...that some things do not change.

674
01:07:33,913 --> 01:07:36,939
-l deserve to pass.
-When does deserving mean anything?

675
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:38,583
They ain't gonna have you.

676
01:07:39,185 --> 01:07:42,177
ln their eyes,
you'll never be as good as them.

677
01:07:42,388 --> 01:07:44,583
-So you're failing.
-No, you are.

678
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:46,587
You think l owe you something?

679
01:07:46,792 --> 01:07:49,454
l don't owe you
a goddamn fucking thing!

680
01:07:49,662 --> 01:07:52,358
You or anybody else.
You got fucked, Cookie.

681
01:07:52,565 --> 01:07:55,728
You were right, chief.
You and l have nothing in common.

682
01:07:55,935 --> 01:07:59,962
l may be some dumb nigger from Podunk
but l'm making something of myself.

683
01:08:00,173 --> 01:08:03,574
You're the same hateful little man
as you started out as.

684
01:08:03,776 --> 01:08:05,744
Without diving you're nothing...

685
01:08:06,179 --> 01:08:08,545
...but a son of a bitch
who used to be something.

686
01:08:29,435 --> 01:08:31,960
What did he say
to make you try so hard?

687
01:08:32,939 --> 01:08:34,338
''Be the best.''

688
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:35,939
Well, you are.

689
01:08:37,944 --> 01:08:39,741
Just don't show up tomorrow.

690
01:08:40,179 --> 01:08:42,147
Pappy ain't going to let you pass.

691
01:08:46,886 --> 01:08:48,444
What about you, chief?

692
01:08:53,826 --> 01:08:57,227
Today will decide which of you
will become Navy divers.

693
01:08:57,430 --> 01:09:01,730
The object of the test is to correctly
assemble this flange underwater.

694
01:09:01,934 --> 01:09:04,664
The pieces required for assembly
are on the river bottom.

695
01:09:05,171 --> 01:09:07,230
Once you locate
your project flange...

696
01:09:07,974 --> 01:09:11,740
...you will call for your tools.
They will be lowered to you.

697
01:09:11,944 --> 01:09:15,675
You will be timed and accrue
points for a speedy completion.

698
01:09:15,881 --> 01:09:19,908
However, we will pump air to you
for as long as you can stand the cold.

699
01:09:20,119 --> 01:09:23,247
So take your time and get it right.

700
01:09:50,916 --> 01:09:53,544
lf you do not complete the flange...

701
01:09:53,753 --> 01:09:56,722
...you have just wasted
six months of your life.

702
01:10:07,867 --> 01:10:12,304
Divers, square yourselves away
and approach the rail.

703
01:10:53,245 --> 01:10:56,009
Topside, l have located my work light.

704
01:11:17,403 --> 01:11:18,995
Topside, blue diver.

705
01:11:19,205 --> 01:11:22,106
I have Iocated my project
and request my tooI bag.

706
01:11:22,308 --> 01:11:27,041
Topside, this is red diver.
I have Iocated my project....

707
01:11:27,246 --> 01:11:30,738
Tenders, lower your tool bags.

708
01:11:54,774 --> 01:11:57,743
Topside, blue diver.
l'm still waiting on my tool bag.

709
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:34,209
Blue diver, your tool bag
is on the river bottom.

710
01:12:51,163 --> 01:12:55,065
Chief, start the project time
on all divers.

711
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:21,820
Machinist's Mate Rourke...

712
01:13:22,261 --> 01:13:25,230
...one hour, 37 minutes.
Perfect assembly.

713
01:13:49,154 --> 01:13:50,951
Surveyor Second Class Yarmouth...

714
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:54,125
...two hours, 1 9 minutes.
Perfect assembly.

715
01:14:12,244 --> 01:14:14,075
Never thought l'd live to see it.

716
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:18,148
Four hours, nine minutes.
Better late than never, Crofoot.

717
01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:21,513
Perfect assembly.
How's the water down there?

718
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,950
Colder than
a well digger's ass, chief.

719
01:14:24,156 --> 01:14:25,487
Take it inside.

720
01:15:06,098 --> 01:15:07,588
What do you mean, still not up?

721
01:16:00,486 --> 01:16:01,475
Excuse me.

722
01:16:18,537 --> 01:16:20,732
-Dive station.
-Chief Sunday...

723
01:16:20,939 --> 01:16:24,841
...we have every cook and shine boy
thinking they'll be next...

724
01:16:25,044 --> 01:16:28,104
...to try a stunt Iike this,
so you Iisten up.

725
01:16:28,547 --> 01:16:30,674
Don't bring him up
till he stops moving.

726
01:16:31,316 --> 01:16:32,681
He's near dead now, sir.

727
01:16:32,885 --> 01:16:34,978
Not till he stops moving, chief!

728
01:16:43,228 --> 01:16:44,217
Give up, Cookie.

729
01:16:44,763 --> 01:16:47,027
You go into shock,
you might not wake up.

730
01:16:47,499 --> 01:16:49,797
Come on now.
This ain't worth dying for.

731
01:16:50,536 --> 01:16:52,026
My name is...

732
01:16:52,738 --> 01:16:54,262
...Boatswain's Mate...

733
01:16:54,473 --> 01:16:55,804
...Second Class...

734
01:16:56,241 --> 01:16:58,402
...Carl Brashear.

735
01:17:00,713 --> 01:17:02,840
I am a Navy diver.

736
01:17:29,241 --> 01:17:30,401
Bring him up.

737
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:32,872
-Bring him up!
-l got him.

738
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:35,613
-We'll bring him home.
-Sailor!

739
01:17:35,814 --> 01:17:37,839
Disregard that order!

740
01:17:39,618 --> 01:17:41,381
Sailor! Sailor!

741
01:17:42,421 --> 01:17:47,120
Chief Sunday, effective immediately...

742
01:17:47,392 --> 01:17:50,691
...l am relieving you of your duties!

743
01:17:51,196 --> 01:17:53,187
Do you hear me, chief?!

744
01:17:56,201 --> 01:17:57,463
Haul in that line.

745
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:24,829
Come on, Brashear.
You're almost there.

746
01:18:25,497 --> 01:18:26,486
A few more steps.

747
01:18:27,633 --> 01:18:29,032
Come on. We'll help you.

748
01:18:44,917 --> 01:18:46,248
Open up.

749
01:19:05,537 --> 01:19:07,767
Boatswain's Mate Carl Brashear...

750
01:19:08,807 --> 01:19:10,274
...nine hours, 31 minutes.

751
01:19:10,943 --> 01:19:12,638
Perfect assembly.

752
01:19:20,485 --> 01:19:21,679
Get him inside.

753
01:19:39,872 --> 01:19:43,137
-Carl, did, did--
-Slow down, Snowhill.

754
01:19:43,342 --> 01:19:46,641
They put me back in the program.
l start training next week.

755
01:19:46,845 --> 01:19:48,005
Congratulations.

756
01:19:49,181 --> 01:19:50,478
Thanks, Carl.

757
01:19:51,683 --> 01:19:52,707
l almost forgot.

758
01:19:52,918 --> 01:19:55,409
-You hear about Sunday?
-No.

759
01:19:55,621 --> 01:19:59,079
Mr. Pappy blew a gasket
when the son of a bitch passed you.

760
01:19:59,291 --> 01:20:02,260
He busted him down a stripe
and shipped him out.

761
01:20:02,594 --> 01:20:04,892
l guess that fucker got his
in the end.

762
01:20:06,531 --> 01:20:08,158
l guess he did.

763
01:20:14,473 --> 01:20:15,906
l guess he did.

764
01:21:21,907 --> 01:21:23,306
From the gentleman.

765
01:21:38,590 --> 01:21:39,818
You hate champagne.

766
01:21:41,293 --> 01:21:45,753
-You got a diving assignment.
-Brooklyn Navy Yard, standby diver.

767
01:21:45,964 --> 01:21:48,626
Brooklyn? Brooklyn.

768
01:21:49,001 --> 01:21:52,300
Baby, we can have dinner
like an old married couple.

769
01:21:52,504 --> 01:21:55,405
Oh, well, baby, l didn't take the job.

770
01:21:55,607 --> 01:21:58,007
We waited three years
for that slot to open up.

771
01:21:58,210 --> 01:22:00,542
l don't move up in rank unless l dive.

772
01:22:00,746 --> 01:22:02,714
l won't make master as a standby.

773
01:22:03,682 --> 01:22:05,479
l'll find something else.

774
01:22:11,456 --> 01:22:13,117
l'm three months late.

775
01:22:13,525 --> 01:22:14,719
Late for what?

776
01:22:20,832 --> 01:22:23,528
You're going to have a...?
A real baby?

777
01:22:25,037 --> 01:22:26,368
We're gonna have a baby!

778
01:22:26,571 --> 01:22:28,300
We're gonna have a real baby!

779
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:29,734
We're gonna have a baby!

780
01:22:29,941 --> 01:22:33,468
Ladies, gentlemen,
and the rest of you lowdown cats...

781
01:22:33,779 --> 01:22:35,371
...it's time to ring in the New Year.

782
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:37,275
Happy New Year.

783
01:22:40,352 --> 01:22:41,910
Happy New Year.

784
01:22:57,869 --> 01:22:59,928
You have to let them know who's boss.

785
01:23:00,138 --> 01:23:02,732
Or they'll never salute you
the rest of your life.

786
01:23:05,043 --> 01:23:06,032
Excuse me.

787
01:23:08,046 --> 01:23:10,514
What'd l tell you, hon?
He don't remember me.

788
01:23:14,119 --> 01:23:17,452
Senior Chief Sunday, U.S.S. Hoist.

789
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:22,217
You ended my diving career,
lieutenant.

790
01:23:22,594 --> 01:23:23,618
Lieutenant Commander...

791
01:23:24,362 --> 01:23:26,353
...Hanks. Pleased to meet you.

792
01:23:26,565 --> 01:23:28,294
That was a long time ago, chief.

793
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:30,127
Ancient history.

794
01:23:32,003 --> 01:23:35,700
Well, we just came by to say hey.

795
01:23:37,676 --> 01:23:40,509
-Auld lang syne and all.
-Auld lang syne.

796
01:23:41,646 --> 01:23:43,477
l didn't know you had a daughter.

797
01:23:43,982 --> 01:23:45,210
Right.

798
01:23:46,184 --> 01:23:47,583
She's quite lovely.

799
01:23:49,521 --> 01:23:52,854
We gotta go now,
because Billy's gonna dance with me.

800
01:23:53,058 --> 01:23:54,855
Happy New Year.

801
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:56,584
-Have fun.
-Come on, Billy.

802
01:23:57,028 --> 01:24:00,259
You're gonna dance
with your lovely wife, right?

803
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:11,338
See? Now wasn't that easy?

804
01:24:12,144 --> 01:24:14,169
-Has-been.
-Yes.

805
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:18,181
No. Billy.

806
01:24:18,383 --> 01:24:20,908
He's the biggest drunk
in the Navy is all.

807
01:24:37,502 --> 01:24:38,969
Senior Chief Sunday...

808
01:24:39,804 --> 01:24:44,264
...you violated Article 90 of
the Uniform Code of Military Justice:

809
01:24:44,476 --> 01:24:46,740
Assaulting a superior
commission officer.

810
01:24:47,345 --> 01:24:50,337
Your conduct
is completely unacceptable.

811
01:24:50,549 --> 01:24:53,211
You're fined one half
month's pay for six months...

812
01:24:53,418 --> 01:24:56,319
...restricted to the base
for two months...

813
01:24:56,521 --> 01:25:00,184
...and are hereby reduced
in rank to chief petty officer.

814
01:25:00,859 --> 01:25:03,851
For those just joining us,
our top story continues...

815
01:25:04,062 --> 01:25:07,054
...thousands of miIes away
in the Mediterranean Sea.

816
01:25:07,265 --> 01:25:10,723
Hours ago, an American B-52 bomber
flying a routine mission...

817
01:25:10,936 --> 01:25:15,032
...over the coast of Spain
sIammed into the Spanish countryside.

818
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:19,643
Moments before, the bomber's crew
jettisoned their nucIear payIoad.

819
01:25:19,844 --> 01:25:22,779
Three 50-megaton
warheads parachuted to Earth.

820
01:25:22,981 --> 01:25:27,850
Two were recovered. However, a third
hydrogen bomb remains Iost at sea.

821
01:25:28,053 --> 01:25:29,418
You made it.

822
01:25:29,754 --> 01:25:32,917
Becky, get your toys.
Your daddy will be home soon.

823
01:25:36,194 --> 01:25:39,027
Investigating in deep water
wiII be the work of ALVIN...

824
01:25:39,231 --> 01:25:43,224
...a two-man submersibIe on Ioan from
Woods HoIe Oceanographic Institute.

825
01:25:43,435 --> 01:25:47,462
As Navy ships comb the Mediterranean
in search of the warhead...

826
01:25:47,672 --> 01:25:49,503
...so do Russian submarines.

827
01:25:49,708 --> 01:25:53,474
Since the bomb disappeared
in internationaI waters...

828
01:25:53,678 --> 01:25:55,612
...it beIongs to whoever finds it.

829
01:25:56,114 --> 01:25:58,742
Charged with Iocating it
before the Soviets...

830
01:25:58,950 --> 01:26:02,044
...are the eIite Navy deep-sea divers
pictured here.

831
01:26:02,254 --> 01:26:06,691
Stationed in NorfoIk, Virginia, the
divers were flown here hours ago...

832
01:26:06,891 --> 01:26:10,554
...many stiII dressed in the uniforms
they had on this morning.

833
01:26:21,606 --> 01:26:23,267
Blue diver, this is captain.

834
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:28,976
BIue diver, come in.

835
01:26:30,315 --> 01:26:32,249
l'm here, Hart. What do you need?

836
01:26:33,418 --> 01:26:36,979
CarI, I'd appreciate it if you couId
find my Iost nuke for me.

837
01:26:37,188 --> 01:26:39,588
I'd Iike to make admiraI before I die.

838
01:26:39,791 --> 01:26:41,782
l'm doing my best, Hart.

839
01:27:10,155 --> 01:27:13,613
l have an unidentified metal object
protruding from the bottom.

840
01:27:13,825 --> 01:27:16,055
He has something.
Proceed with caution.

841
01:27:16,261 --> 01:27:17,694
Roger that.

842
01:27:27,138 --> 01:27:29,402
Topside, we have a Coke can.

843
01:27:30,075 --> 01:27:31,838
Goddamn Coke can.

844
01:27:32,344 --> 01:27:35,745
Bring it up anyway, chief.
I Iike my ocean cIean.

845
01:27:40,752 --> 01:27:42,652
Turn sonar off. A diver's down--

846
01:27:42,854 --> 01:27:45,288
-That's not our sonar.
-What?

847
01:27:47,125 --> 01:27:48,251
Shit.

848
01:27:49,828 --> 01:27:51,989
Alpha Whiskey, this is Charlie Victor.

849
01:27:52,197 --> 01:27:55,064
l've got an unknown object.
Probable submarine.

850
01:27:56,835 --> 01:27:58,928
BIue diver,
we have an unknown contact.

851
01:27:59,137 --> 01:28:01,503
ProbabIe Russian sub.
Bearing at 209...

852
01:28:01,706 --> 01:28:04,641
...at 16 knots
and headed directIy for you.

853
01:28:04,843 --> 01:28:08,108
Take immediate evasive action.
Immediate evasive action.

854
01:28:08,313 --> 01:28:12,249
Prepare for emergency surface.
BIue diver, do you hear me?

855
01:28:12,450 --> 01:28:13,542
Do you hear me?

856
01:28:13,752 --> 01:28:14,776
Blue diver?

857
01:28:18,390 --> 01:28:19,652
Talk to me, Carl.

858
01:28:49,888 --> 01:28:51,150
Talk to me, Carl.

859
01:29:04,369 --> 01:29:05,393
Come in, blue diver.

860
01:29:15,713 --> 01:29:17,806
Tell the dive station
to supply a standby.

861
01:29:19,918 --> 01:29:21,317
Come in, CarI.

862
01:29:31,930 --> 01:29:33,488
Come on, Carl.

863
01:29:52,450 --> 01:29:54,111
CarI, do you read me?

864
01:29:55,019 --> 01:29:56,145
l'm here, captain.

865
01:29:57,121 --> 01:29:58,145
He's there.

866
01:29:58,857 --> 01:30:01,758
Prepare to surface, Carl.
We're bringing you home.

867
01:30:11,169 --> 01:30:15,833
Next time you scare the shit out of me
give me a courtesy warning first.

868
01:30:27,252 --> 01:30:30,221
Captain, the sub kicked up
half the ocean bottom.

869
01:30:30,421 --> 01:30:31,786
lt found it for us!

870
01:30:32,423 --> 01:30:33,515
You're kidding.

871
01:30:34,659 --> 01:30:36,024
Oh, yeah!

872
01:30:36,327 --> 01:30:37,555
He thinks he found it.

873
01:30:38,129 --> 01:30:40,063
Yeah, you got it. That's it.

874
01:30:43,334 --> 01:30:44,494
Steady!

875
01:30:45,103 --> 01:30:48,664
Steady. Let's take it in.
Bring it up.

876
01:30:58,149 --> 01:30:59,480
Let's go now.

877
01:31:16,301 --> 01:31:17,359
Move!

878
01:32:20,698 --> 01:32:21,722
Jo.

879
01:32:31,976 --> 01:32:33,910
l was so scared.

880
01:32:34,112 --> 01:32:35,579
l'm sorry.

881
01:32:42,887 --> 01:32:44,684
Oh, shit.

882
01:32:49,127 --> 01:32:50,594
Your leg...

883
01:32:51,129 --> 01:32:52,960
...was nearly severed.

884
01:32:55,733 --> 01:32:57,792
lt's gonna take time to heal.

885
01:33:00,138 --> 01:33:04,302
Eventually, you're gonna be able
to walk again, with a cane.

886
01:33:07,345 --> 01:33:09,040
Can l still dive?

887
01:33:12,083 --> 01:33:13,812
l'm so sorry.

888
01:33:49,987 --> 01:33:51,750
Come home, Carl.

889
01:33:59,997 --> 01:34:03,728
Your husband was found drunk
on a public beach this morning.

890
01:34:03,935 --> 01:34:08,531
He's an alcoholic and must remain here
in detox for 30 days.

891
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:11,675
lf he should stagger,
he will not fall!

892
01:34:11,876 --> 01:34:15,141
lf he should fall,
he will fall in such a manner...

893
01:34:15,346 --> 01:34:16,643
...as to cover up his rate...

894
01:34:16,848 --> 01:34:20,375
...so that passersby will think
he is an officer!

895
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:25,511
A chief petty officer shall not drink.

896
01:34:25,723 --> 01:34:29,181
However, if he should drink,
he shall not get drunk.

897
01:34:29,393 --> 01:34:33,193
lf he should get drunk,
he shall not stagger!

898
01:34:33,397 --> 01:34:36,457
lf he should stagger,
he shall not fall!

899
01:34:36,667 --> 01:34:40,228
And if he should fall,
he will fall in such a manner...

900
01:34:40,438 --> 01:34:44,101
...as to cover up his rate, so
passersby will think he's an officer!

901
01:34:45,843 --> 01:34:48,812
We're all extremely proud of you,
Chief Brashear.

902
01:34:49,013 --> 01:34:53,677
Now get better so you can go home
and enjoy your retirement.

903
01:34:53,885 --> 01:34:55,079
Give us a smile, chief.

904
01:34:55,286 --> 01:34:58,813
-How will you spend retirement?
-How's it feel to be a hero?

905
01:35:19,844 --> 01:35:21,072
Hey, you.

906
01:36:01,786 --> 01:36:03,014
Sweetheart...

907
01:36:08,392 --> 01:36:10,121
...you'll never dive again.

908
01:36:14,966 --> 01:36:16,866
And what you gotta do now...

909
01:36:17,768 --> 01:36:19,702
...l can't help you with.

910
01:36:25,276 --> 01:36:27,244
But when you're ready to leave...

911
01:36:27,712 --> 01:36:32,513
...and if you can promise me you'll
never take another drink again...

912
01:36:33,017 --> 01:36:36,180
...l'll be waiting for you
in that car over there.

913
01:36:40,391 --> 01:36:41,915
But if you can't...

914
01:36:48,399 --> 01:36:50,264
...then you just walk on by.

915
01:37:35,279 --> 01:37:36,678
Package for you, sir.

916
01:37:59,937 --> 01:38:01,700
I want to come back.

917
01:38:02,373 --> 01:38:05,103
-To where, chief?
-Full diving duty.

918
01:38:05,910 --> 01:38:07,605
l want to dive again.

919
01:38:07,845 --> 01:38:09,369
Carl...

920
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:12,112
-...l understand but....
-But...

921
01:38:12,817 --> 01:38:14,580
...it's just not possible.

922
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:17,717
Good afternoon, admiral.

923
01:38:18,189 --> 01:38:20,419
-Carl, this is--
-Captain Hanks.

924
01:38:20,725 --> 01:38:21,714
Chief Brashear.

925
01:38:21,993 --> 01:38:24,621
Captain Hanks is the senior officer...

926
01:38:24,829 --> 01:38:28,663
...of the Personnel Policy
Control Board at the Pentagon.

927
01:38:28,866 --> 01:38:30,390
He'll be with us a few weeks...

928
01:38:30,601 --> 01:38:34,128
...meeting some of the men from the
front lines, hearing their concerns.

929
01:38:34,338 --> 01:38:36,932
To return to the chief's
primary concern.

930
01:38:37,141 --> 01:38:41,237
Working as a Navy diver
with one good leg and the other....

931
01:38:41,879 --> 01:38:44,313
l'm sorry, it's just not possible.

932
01:38:44,515 --> 01:38:45,539
Cut it off.

933
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:53,120
''lnjured pilots have requested
amputation of injured limbs.

934
01:38:53,324 --> 01:38:56,487
With a prosthesis,
several have returned to duty.''

935
01:38:57,828 --> 01:38:58,954
l'm asking this:

936
01:38:59,163 --> 01:39:04,100
Cut off my leg and assemble a medical
review board 1 2 weeks from today.

937
01:39:04,335 --> 01:39:08,396
Then l will demonstrate that l am fit
to return to full diving duty.

938
01:39:09,073 --> 01:39:11,007
l want to make master chief.

939
01:39:13,811 --> 01:39:17,804
We admire your courage, chief,
however misplaced it may be.

940
01:39:18,015 --> 01:39:19,482
Please excuse us.

941
01:39:30,728 --> 01:39:32,525
l am a doctor, Carl.

942
01:39:32,863 --> 01:39:35,354
My opinion might mean something here.

943
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:40,626
l guess not.

944
01:39:42,873 --> 01:39:45,034
How will you come back with one leg?

945
01:39:45,509 --> 01:39:47,500
l could barely read once.
l found a way.

946
01:39:51,048 --> 01:39:53,812
l could put up with the months
at sea...

947
01:39:54,785 --> 01:39:57,219
...the dangerous assignments
you never refused.

948
01:39:57,421 --> 01:39:59,389
-But this?
-What do you want from me?

949
01:40:00,791 --> 01:40:04,955
That l come home, mow the lawn,
put a wheelchair ramp in?

950
01:40:05,596 --> 01:40:08,997
-How am l gonna look at my son?
-Leave him out of this.

951
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,130
You're not doing this for him or me.
This is about you.

952
01:40:14,572 --> 01:40:16,733
lt's always been about you.

953
01:40:18,109 --> 01:40:19,667
Admit it, Carl.

954
01:40:20,711 --> 01:40:23,339
At least give me that much.

955
01:40:33,324 --> 01:40:35,758
Why are you doing this to me?

956
01:40:40,731 --> 01:40:42,323
Answer me, goddamn it!

957
01:40:42,766 --> 01:40:46,634
Or l'm walking out of here
and l am not coming back.

958
01:41:21,038 --> 01:41:22,528
l love you, Jo.

959
01:43:45,115 --> 01:43:47,208
Get away! Get away from me!

960
01:43:47,451 --> 01:43:48,782
Piece of shit!

961
01:43:50,854 --> 01:43:51,912
Cookie.

962
01:43:53,824 --> 01:43:57,316
Goddamn. Looks like l missed
one hell of a party.

963
01:44:04,034 --> 01:44:05,729
l've been all over.

964
01:44:06,270 --> 01:44:07,862
Trouble, mostly.

965
01:44:08,072 --> 01:44:11,701
Navy gave me a second-class diving
school in Little Creek.

966
01:44:11,909 --> 01:44:13,604
Don't amount to shit.

967
01:44:17,781 --> 01:44:19,612
l made some calls.

968
01:44:21,618 --> 01:44:23,279
On Friday, that Captain Hanks...

969
01:44:23,487 --> 01:44:27,048
...is convening a medical review board
and he's gonna retire you.

970
01:44:29,593 --> 01:44:32,323
-He said l had 4 weeks.
-He lied, Cookie.

971
01:44:32,663 --> 01:44:35,894
He don't care how many one-legged
pushups you can do.

972
01:44:36,100 --> 01:44:39,194
He'd trade you and me
and every other sea dog...

973
01:44:39,403 --> 01:44:41,871
...for one glass-eyed
electronics technician.

974
01:44:42,072 --> 01:44:44,006
The man's gonna retire your ass.

975
01:44:44,208 --> 01:44:46,005
My leg's back. l ain't done yet.

976
01:44:46,210 --> 01:44:49,668
You got a stump on a stick
and no chance of beating Hanks, son.

977
01:44:55,519 --> 01:44:59,580
-All l wanted was to be master diver.
-All l wanted was to stay one.

978
01:45:01,892 --> 01:45:04,554
You want to beat Hanks,
you got to go around him...

979
01:45:04,762 --> 01:45:06,354
...right to the top.

980
01:45:07,364 --> 01:45:08,353
Washington.

981
01:45:10,033 --> 01:45:13,093
-Chief of naval personnel.
-That's right.

982
01:45:13,871 --> 01:45:17,170
They don't like cocky pencil pushers
like Hanks any more than we do.

983
01:45:20,644 --> 01:45:22,669
l might be able to pull a few strings.

984
01:45:29,386 --> 01:45:31,354
Why are you doing this, Sunday?

985
01:45:34,958 --> 01:45:36,585
Piss people off.

986
01:45:37,227 --> 01:45:40,162
Chief Decker, you are
the chief master at arms...

987
01:45:40,364 --> 01:45:41,729
...of this hospital?

988
01:45:41,932 --> 01:45:42,899
Yes, sir.

989
01:45:45,169 --> 01:45:49,037
Then why is it you don't know
where Chief Brashear is?

990
01:45:49,773 --> 01:45:51,741
He shouldn't be too hard to spot.

991
01:45:51,942 --> 01:45:55,434
He's the only negro diver
in the Navy...

992
01:45:55,646 --> 01:45:57,307
...and he's got one leg.

993
01:45:57,848 --> 01:46:01,750
lt seems that the chief
has transferred, sir.

994
01:46:03,454 --> 01:46:05,979
-On whose orders?
-He signed his own, sir.

995
01:46:07,891 --> 01:46:09,153
Call the shore patrol.

996
01:46:09,359 --> 01:46:11,418
Relax, cap. We just want to talk.

997
01:46:13,030 --> 01:46:14,122
Wait, wait, wait.

998
01:46:14,765 --> 01:46:17,097
You know where Chief Brashear is.
Where?

999
01:46:19,770 --> 01:46:21,829
l see. Fine.

1000
01:46:22,039 --> 01:46:25,440
Chief Brashear is AWOL.
l want him found and arrested now.

1001
01:46:25,642 --> 01:46:27,075
You ain't gonna find him.

1002
01:46:28,412 --> 01:46:29,572
What do you want?

1003
01:46:29,780 --> 01:46:33,511
Four weeks to train him,
then a reinstatement hearing...

1004
01:46:33,717 --> 01:46:35,309
...with the chief of naval personnel.

1005
01:46:36,220 --> 01:46:38,211
-The chief of...?
-Yes, sir.

1006
01:46:38,422 --> 01:46:40,117
-ln Washington?
-That's right.

1007
01:46:40,657 --> 01:46:42,056
Forget it.

1008
01:46:48,599 --> 01:46:51,534
-Will the diver be reinstated?
-Will he get a hearing?

1009
01:46:51,735 --> 01:46:56,001
Seems Chief Brashear losing his leg
for his country makes him a hero, sir.

1010
01:46:56,740 --> 01:46:57,832
Fine.

1011
01:47:02,746 --> 01:47:04,873
l will grant you your hearing...

1012
01:47:05,282 --> 01:47:06,681
...on one condition.

1013
01:47:07,751 --> 01:47:10,618
When he fails, you retire.

1014
01:47:11,221 --> 01:47:12,882
He ain't gonna fail.

1015
01:47:58,635 --> 01:48:00,569
Minute five faster.

1016
01:48:04,174 --> 01:48:05,607
See you in court.

1017
01:49:43,106 --> 01:49:45,472
Captain Hanks ordered you
to remain here, chief.

1018
01:50:11,768 --> 01:50:14,259
Please be seated,
Senior Chief Brashear.

1019
01:50:20,277 --> 01:50:22,871
Only the Army salutes indoors,
senior chief.

1020
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:25,605
The Navy l grew up in
warrants a salute...

1021
01:50:25,816 --> 01:50:27,681
...given the gravity
of this occasion.

1022
01:50:27,884 --> 01:50:29,078
Well...

1023
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:32,083
...we're in a new Navy now.

1024
01:50:38,228 --> 01:50:39,456
Shall we begin?

1025
01:50:46,169 --> 01:50:48,729
Do you honestly feel that,
as a man....

1026
01:50:51,808 --> 01:50:53,298
You're almost 40.

1027
01:50:53,577 --> 01:50:55,442
You have one leg.

1028
01:50:55,679 --> 01:50:59,342
Can you really keep up
with healthy divers half your age?

1029
01:51:00,150 --> 01:51:01,981
The question is, sir:

1030
01:51:02,385 --> 01:51:03,943
Can they keep up with me?

1031
01:51:10,527 --> 01:51:11,858
No smoking, chief.

1032
01:51:28,211 --> 01:51:32,739
Navy diving studies indicate that
if a subject were to become...

1033
01:51:32,949 --> 01:51:35,577
...unconscious or deceased...

1034
01:51:35,786 --> 01:51:39,882
...the disparity between the buoyancy
of a prosthetic...

1035
01:51:40,090 --> 01:51:43,218
...and a limb would hinder him
in a free dive mode.

1036
01:51:43,426 --> 01:51:46,953
You mean if he drowned,
he wouldn't float right, yes?

1037
01:51:48,198 --> 01:51:51,759
Sirs, l promise
if l am killed at sea...

1038
01:51:51,968 --> 01:51:54,596
...l will make every effort
to die like a Navy man.

1039
01:52:20,764 --> 01:52:23,790
You should see the future
of Navy deep-sea diving.

1040
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,468
This is the latest He/O2,
mixed gas rig.

1041
01:52:26,670 --> 01:52:28,262
lt weighs 290 pounds.

1042
01:52:28,471 --> 01:52:33,408
Men who want to use it, before
starting diving training, must walk...

1043
01:52:33,643 --> 01:52:36,339
...twelve steps unassisted.

1044
01:52:38,348 --> 01:52:40,816
Could you do that,
Senior Chief Brashear?

1045
01:52:48,024 --> 01:52:49,184
Yes, sir, l could.

1046
01:52:50,594 --> 01:52:51,583
Well...

1047
01:52:51,928 --> 01:52:53,156
...l see.

1048
01:52:53,964 --> 01:52:55,488
Much as l hate to prolong this...

1049
01:52:55,699 --> 01:52:58,759
...in the interest of thoroughness,
l'll make arrangements...

1050
01:52:58,969 --> 01:53:00,527
...for you to demonstrate.

1051
01:53:00,737 --> 01:53:01,863
Here, sir.

1052
01:53:02,472 --> 01:53:03,598
Now.

1053
01:53:04,674 --> 01:53:07,507
Son, step aside,
or l'll crack you in the jaw.

1054
01:53:11,047 --> 01:53:15,541
-This is hardly the appropriate venue.
-l want them all to see, sir.

1055
01:53:16,419 --> 01:53:19,047
Captain, l concur
with your assessment.

1056
01:53:23,493 --> 01:53:26,018
These slippery floors prohibit
a demonstration.

1057
01:53:26,229 --> 01:53:28,595
Haven't you had enough career trouble?

1058
01:53:29,199 --> 01:53:31,326
Your advice and presence
are unwelcome.

1059
01:53:31,735 --> 01:53:34,670
-Who is this man?
-Chief Leslie W. Sunday, sir.

1060
01:53:35,705 --> 01:53:39,232
You swam out of the Saint Lo
at Leyte Gulf.

1061
01:53:40,977 --> 01:53:42,342
Held your breath for...

1062
01:53:43,647 --> 01:53:45,512
-...four minutes.
-Five, sir.

1063
01:53:49,152 --> 01:53:50,244
He can stay.

1064
01:53:52,889 --> 01:53:55,449
Fine. lrrelevant.

1065
01:53:56,293 --> 01:53:59,524
Gentlemen, sirs, returning
to the issue at hand...

1066
01:53:59,930 --> 01:54:03,923
...this is not the time or place
for Senior Chief Bra--

1067
01:54:05,902 --> 01:54:08,564
Excuse me, senior chief.
ls there a problem?

1068
01:54:12,609 --> 01:54:13,598
Captain Hanks...

1069
01:54:14,778 --> 01:54:18,077
...l've spent my life in the Navy
trying only to succeed.

1070
01:54:18,548 --> 01:54:22,040
But my quest has caused great
personal loss to those who love me.

1071
01:54:22,719 --> 01:54:24,687
They too have made sacrifices.

1072
01:54:24,888 --> 01:54:27,880
They too have endured
great pains to support me.

1073
01:54:28,158 --> 01:54:30,649
lf l walk these 1 2 steps today...

1074
01:54:31,027 --> 01:54:33,291
...reinstate me to active duty.

1075
01:54:33,830 --> 01:54:35,422
Give me my career back.

1076
01:54:35,865 --> 01:54:39,130
Let me finish it,
and go home in peace.

1077
01:54:42,238 --> 01:54:45,571
Senior Chief Brashear,
the business of the modern Navy--

1078
01:54:45,775 --> 01:54:49,677
Forgive me, sir, but to me
the Navy is not a business.

1079
01:54:49,980 --> 01:54:53,643
We have many traditions. ln my
career, l've experienced most of them.

1080
01:54:53,883 --> 01:54:56,351
Some good, some bad.

1081
01:54:56,619 --> 01:55:00,419
However, l wouldn't be here today
if not for our greatest tradition.

1082
01:55:01,658 --> 01:55:03,148
And which one is that?

1083
01:55:04,761 --> 01:55:05,989
Honor, sir.

1084
01:55:14,971 --> 01:55:17,371
Get on with it, senior chief.

1085
01:55:20,944 --> 01:55:22,275
Leslie?

1086
01:55:24,147 --> 01:55:25,671
What leg you got on?

1087
01:55:26,216 --> 01:55:27,808
My walking leg...

1088
01:55:28,018 --> 01:55:29,246
...Leslie.

1089
01:55:29,452 --> 01:55:31,079
lt was my dad's name.
Got a problem?

1090
01:55:31,287 --> 01:55:33,778
Oh, no, no problem at all.

1091
01:55:40,430 --> 01:55:43,524
That thing's light duty.
lt'll snap like a matchstick.

1092
01:55:43,733 --> 01:55:46,930
-l'll put my weight on my good leg.
-290 pounds on one leg?

1093
01:55:47,137 --> 01:55:50,129
You'll be passed out by the sixth step.

1094
01:55:52,308 --> 01:55:54,538
Tenders, hat the diver.

1095
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:46,128
Navy diver, stand up.

1096
01:56:48,131 --> 01:56:49,291
Leave him.

1097
01:56:50,834 --> 01:56:55,362
Captain, if l recall Navy regulations,
the diver may be helped to his feet.

1098
01:56:56,473 --> 01:56:59,203
lt's a lot of brass to sling up
from a seated position.

1099
01:56:59,876 --> 01:57:03,334
lt's spun copper, chief.
We haven't used brass in a decade.

1100
01:57:03,546 --> 01:57:07,038
The new manual states the diver
must rise unassisted.

1101
01:57:07,250 --> 01:57:09,218
That's what it says in the new book?

1102
01:57:10,787 --> 01:57:13,984
lf l may ask, captain,
how would you know?

1103
01:57:14,624 --> 01:57:15,818
l wrote it.

1104
01:57:19,963 --> 01:57:21,362
Yes, sir.

1105
01:57:26,803 --> 01:57:27,792
Navy diver...

1106
01:57:28,004 --> 01:57:29,437
...stand up.

1107
01:57:39,082 --> 01:57:41,744
Square that rig and approach the rail.

1108
01:58:02,639 --> 01:58:03,663
One.

1109
01:58:06,476 --> 01:58:07,534
Two.

1110
01:58:10,713 --> 01:58:11,702
Three.

1111
01:58:15,385 --> 01:58:16,374
Four.

1112
01:58:19,689 --> 01:58:20,713
Five.

1113
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:24,949
Six.

1114
01:58:26,996 --> 01:58:27,963
Seven.

1115
01:58:31,167 --> 01:58:32,065
Eight.

1116
01:58:38,007 --> 01:58:39,167
Gentlemen, his leg.

1117
01:58:40,510 --> 01:58:41,568
Please.

1118
01:58:42,712 --> 01:58:43,701
Gentlemen.

1119
01:58:45,882 --> 01:58:48,851
-Navy diver, stand down.
-Diver, you will disregard.

1120
01:58:49,185 --> 01:58:51,016
-This is my detail.
-Admiral?

1121
01:58:53,489 --> 01:58:56,822
Goddamn it, Cookie, move your ass!
l want my 1 2.

1122
01:59:08,871 --> 01:59:11,271
Nine. The Navy diver
is not a fighting man.

1123
01:59:11,474 --> 01:59:13,499
He is a salvage expert.

1124
01:59:14,344 --> 01:59:16,938
Ten. lf it's lost underwater,
he finds it.

1125
01:59:17,146 --> 01:59:18,738
lf it's sunk, he brings it up.

1126
01:59:18,948 --> 01:59:21,439
lf it's in the way, he moves it.

1127
01:59:21,851 --> 01:59:26,652
Eleven. lf he's lucky, he'll die
young, 200 feet beneath the waves.

1128
01:59:26,856 --> 01:59:29,791
For that is the closest
he will ever get to being a hero.

1129
01:59:29,993 --> 01:59:33,190
Hell, l don't know why anyone
would want to be a Navy diver.

1130
01:59:33,463 --> 01:59:36,091
Now you report to this line, Cookie.

1131
01:59:40,703 --> 01:59:42,466
At ease.

1132
01:59:55,618 --> 01:59:57,210
Tenders, unhat that diver.

1133
02:00:19,942 --> 02:00:22,968
The United States Navy
proudly reinstates...

1134
02:00:23,680 --> 02:00:25,409
...senior chief and diver...

1135
02:00:26,282 --> 02:00:30,116
...Carl Brashear to full active duty.

1136
02:00:50,273 --> 02:00:51,262
Thank you.

1137
02:01:07,056 --> 02:01:08,421
l can quit.

1138
02:01:09,025 --> 02:01:12,483
The man l married never quit anything
a day in his life.

1139
02:01:16,766 --> 02:01:18,028
l love you.

1140
02:01:18,234 --> 02:01:22,068
l love you too, baby.
l love you too.
