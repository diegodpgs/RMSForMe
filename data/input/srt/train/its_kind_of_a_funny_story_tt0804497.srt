I don't care about my bike.
I'm killing myself.

a lot of money on

Or I was sexually abused.

less dramatic than that.

but I do have a probIem
with stress vomiting.

take you off the meds?

on my own.

gonna suggest is that
we contact your parents,

74
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,790
let them know
what's going on,

75

and then we refer you
to one of our

into this facility,

are very, very sick.

I am, too.

82
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,933
Well, can't you just, like,
give me something?

Look, this is
serious business.

85
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:21,524
Maybe I'm not explaining right
how serious this is.

86
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,987
It feels like everything
is just building up,

I'm scared, okay?

91
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,086
And I can't go
back out there.

92
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,921
I don't know what. . .

93
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,382
I might do something.

to help me.

Let's go jump him
in the parking lot.

It's under the hat.

It's under the hat?

So, Craig, how are you
adjusting to 3 North?

Uh. . . Okay, I guess.

Dr. Mahmoud wrote that
you were taking Zoloft,

318
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,827
but went off it
three weeks ago.
Is that right?

319
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,370
Yeah.

Do you see a therapist?

321
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,166
Dr. Yanof was the one
who prescribed me the Zoloft.

I see her every,
you know, month or so.

323
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,256
Why did you stop taking it?

324
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:21,970
I guess
I thought I was better.
Like I didn't need it.

325
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,431
Maybe that's because
it was working.

326
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,601
Can you describe to me
how you were feeling

before coming
here this morning?

328
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,981
I guess, depressed.

Anxious, stressed.

330
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,862
Have you been
feeling more stress
than usual lately?

331
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,824
Any reason in particular?

Well, that I really
want to get into.

335
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,418
But the application
is due in a week

336
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,170

even looked at it.

Every time I think about it,

00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:02,469
my brain starts
this cycling thing
about not getting in.

if you didn't get in?

be abIe to put it on my
coIIege appIications.

342
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:11,144
Which means I wouldn't
get into a good coIIege.

343
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,771
But not even Adam Smith
could have foreseen

344
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,106
the inequities of
modern capitalism.

345
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:18,151
If I didn't get
into a good coIIege,
I wouIdn't have a good job.

Welcome to my crib.

So I wouldn't be able
to find a girIfriend.

352
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,924
Which means I'd
probabIy get depressed.

353
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:45,220
And I'd end up Iike Muqtada
in a pIace Iike this
for the rest of my Iife.

354

if I didn't get in?

355
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,687
I don't know.
It's hard to explain.

356

Do you have anyone
you can explain it to?
Friends? Family?

I have friends and family,
but it's not always easy.

really talk to.

462
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:34,902
Then what is it, Bob?

463
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,112
PROFESSOR:
Maybe he's hungry.

464
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,322
HUMBLE: He doesn't
look hungry.

465
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:38,448
He looks tired.

466
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:39,615
JOHNNY: Did you
sleep last night?

467
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,783
PROFESSOR:
He didn't eat today.

468
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:41,868
HUMBLE: Yes, he did.

469
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,120
PROFESSOR:
Did you see him eat?

470
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,496
HUMBLE: I'm pretty
sure he ate.

471
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:46,622
JOHNNY: I didn't see him eat.

472
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:47,832
BECCA: I get anxious
when I'm tired.

473
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,292
Okay, listen.

474
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:54,339
I'm not hungry
and I'm not tired.
It's just the sweater.

475
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,466
It's all I have for
my interview tomorrow.

476
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,092
I told you it
was the interview.

477
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:00,178
It's a nice sweater, Bob.

478
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:03,348
No, it's not.
It smells like
a hobo's Band-Aid.

479
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:04,640
JOHNNY: But it looks
good on you.

480
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:06,476
About as good as
your hair looks on you.

481
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,603
Bobby, no insults, please.

482
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,857
I can loan you a shirt.

483
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:14,817
MINERVA: What was
that, Craig?

484
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:17,779
I'll just call my mom
and have her bring one
of my dad's shirts over.

485
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,365
It's not a problem.
I live like two blocks away.

486
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:21,532
No, thanks.

487
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,242
Bobby! Take the shirt.

488
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,286
Yeah, he's trying
to help, Bob.

489
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,914
MINERVA: It's a very
nice offer, Craig.

490
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:30,792
Bobby, why are you
reluctant to accept it?

491
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:35,046
(SIGHING) 'Cause I don't
want any handouts.

492
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,714
It wouldn't exactly
be a handout.

493
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,299
He'd just be
loaning it to you.

494
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,551
Okay, I'll take it.
As long as you'll
get off my back.

495
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:42,136
Do you want
the shirt, Bobby?

496
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:43,304
I would. . .

497
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,181
I would like the shirt.

498
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,641
MINERVA: Craig?

499
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,643
Is it okay if it has
yellow armpit stains?

500
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,773
(EXCLAIMS) Sorry,
it was a dumb joke.

501
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:57,235
BOBBY: When are you
going to let me get
to see her again?

502
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,153
BOBBY: When are you
going to let me get
to see her again?

503
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:02,115
Because I'm her father.
You don't think that I have. . .

504
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,493
BOBBY: What's that?
I do have. . .
I will have a place.

505
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:10,331
(STUTTERS) I have a. . .
I'm gonna have a place
on Thursday. It's true.

506
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:15,294
Listen, I never asked
you for anything.

507
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:19,674
Could you just, for once,
maybe do what I say.
Hello? Hello!

508
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:24,095
(BOBBY SLAMMING PHONE)

509
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:34,272
AUTOMATED VOICE:
You have two new messages.

510
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:36,649
Hey, Craig. It's me.

511
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:40,153
CRAIG: Okay. So,
she's probabIy not in
the bathtub right now,

512
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,405
but this is how
I sometimes like
to picture Nia.

513
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,490
It's sick, I knoW.

514
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:46,242
You were acting
a little weird earlier,

515
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,494
so I just
wanted to make sure
everything's okay.

516
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:49,954
All right, that's it.

517
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,165
I'm with Aaron.
He's being such
a tool. Bye!

518
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:57,295
Hello, Mr. Gilner,
this is your science teacher,
Mr. Reynolds.

519
00:29:57,379 --> 00:30:01,048
We really need to talk
about your missing
lab assignments.

520
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:04,177
Five of them.

00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:23,863
Hello?

524
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,907
Hey, Nia. What's up?

525
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:31,287
Hey! Just finishing
my Gates Summer app.
I'll freak if I don't get in.

526
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,915
What's up with you?

527
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:38,211
Um. Just feeling
kind of, you know. . .

528
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:41,923
Yeah, I noticed.
Is that why you weren't
in school today?

529
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:45,551
Yeah, I was
feeling pretty shitty,
so I just stayed home.

530
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:47,637
Yeah. I get Iike that
sometimes, too.

531
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,306
Depressed or whatever.

532
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:53,768
Do you take
anything for it?

533
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:55,937
Um. . .

534
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:58,689
Look, I never
told anybody this.

535
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:02,318
Not even Aaron, but,
if it makes you
feeI any better,

536
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:04,362
I see a therapist.

537
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:05,488
Really?

538
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,865
For, like,
over a year now.

539
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,492
CRAIG: I had no idea.

540
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,536
Yeah, it's pretty
embarrassing.

541
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:14,956
I take Zoloft.
Shut up!

542
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,332
I do.

543

Oh, my God !
We're like so
screwed up.

Yeah, we're like partners
in mental illness.

(CHUCKLING) The illest.

I'm Solomon.
I would ask you to
please keep it down.

Excuse me.

00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,601
Is everything okay?
Will you be much longer?

551
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:36,769
One second, please.

552
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,312
Are you Iike in
a crack den or something?

553
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:41,232
Yeah, no, it's fine.
Everything's. . .

554
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,402
It'll come to you.
It will always
come to you.

(CLEARS THROAT)

556
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,574
I gotta go, Nia. Bye.

00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:50,783
Craig...

558
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,410
It's all yours.

559
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,291
Thanks, Mom.

560
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,251
You know,
your dad really wanted
to be here today,

561
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,169
he just had a client crisis.

562
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:04,213
Client crisis?

563
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,383
Yeah, but he said,
he's for sure
coming tomorrow.

564
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,719
Have you made
any friends yet?

565
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,221
CRAIG: Yeah, I guess.

566
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:13,556
Are you friends
with the tranny?

567
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,682
Oh, the tranny.

568
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:16,183
Not really.

569
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,769
Did you talk to my school?

570
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:21,856
Because I really
can't have them finding
I'm in a place like this.

571
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,274
It could really
damage my future.

572
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,526
No, no. I just said
you were in the hospital.

573
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:26,861
I didn't say
anything specific.

574
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,821
Good. The last thing
I need is for them

575
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,156
to find out I've
been institutionalized.

576
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,699
Transvestite!

577

JENNIFER: Schizo!

578
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,134
What's going on, babe?

579
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,302
Uh. . .

580
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:55,222
Sorry. I was just
dropping the shirt off.

581

She's cute, isn't she?

582
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,395
Yeah. Is she yours?

583
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,440
Veronica. Like the
Elvis Costello song.

584

How old is she?

585
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:07,902
Eight and three-quarters.

586
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,072
That's what she says.
Three quarters.

587
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,327
Well, good luck
with your interview.

588
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,871
What's it for,
if you don't
mind me asking?

589
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,332
A group home.

590
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:23,626
Basically,
I need a place to live

591
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,711
when they kick me out
of here on Thursday.

592
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:29,924
Let me know if you
need somebody to practice
with or something.

593
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,300
What do you mean?

594
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:34,136
Like a practice interview.
So you're better prepared.

595
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,013
Yeah?

596
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:37,473
Yeah.

597
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:38,557
You want to try?

598
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:39,642
You want to try now?

599
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,435
lf you're not
doing anything.

600
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,729
Okay, great.
Uh. . . Hold on.

601
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,524
Let me do this with
the official shirt on.

602
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:54,281
Okay. You're ready?

603
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:58,369
Hold on one second.
I don't know if
I'll do it like. . .

604
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:01,080
Which is better, like. . .

605
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:02,873
This?

606
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:04,125
Yeah. That looks natural.

607
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,334
Okay.

608
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,798
You can relax.

609
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:13,134
(SIGHING) I'm nervous.

610
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:17,805
Okay, why is it that you
think you qualify to live
in this group home?

611
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:22,518
Because if you
don't accept me,
I'll be homeless.

612
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:28,232
Okay, good.

613
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,402
Yeah, I think you're ready.

614
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,612
Really? I didn't
sound too desperate?

615
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,907
No. But, uh. . .

616
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:40,494
You might want to focus
on the positive things

617
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,079
that you get from
this experience

618
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:44,331
as opposed to, you know. . .

619
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,167
The negative.

620
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,503
Exactly. Like what
is it that you could
bring to the home?

621
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,839
Something special that
only you could offer.

622
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:58,053
It could be anything.
Maybe you have
a great attitude?

623
00:34:58,138 --> 00:34:59,180
No.

624
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:03,225
You always clean up
after yourself?

625
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:05,352
Not really.

626
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,023
You know, I think
in these situations

627
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,108
it's okay to bend the truth
just a little bit.

628
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:14,069
Yeah. I just
don't want to get
people's expectations up

629
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,405
and then
disappoint them later.

630
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,576
That's it. You're pragmatic.
That's what you tell them.

631
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,537
Okay, yeah. Right?

632
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,414
Yeah, I know
you're gonna do great.

633
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,249
Thanks.

634
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,961
You want to play
some table tennis?

635
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,464
I'm pretty terrible
at table tennis.

636
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,841
It's all right.
It's just for fun.
Come on.

637
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:38,886
BOBBY: We play
a lot around here.
The problem is,

638
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,722
most people are
too zonked out on
their meds to compete.

639
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:43,849
One, zip.

640
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:44,058
She's a liar.

641
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,392
She's a liar.

642
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:50,981
Please, baby. Baby.
Please listen. Listen.

643
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,901
I love you.

00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,113
Don't worry about it.

Of course,
I forgive you, baby.

You came.

649
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:26,267
Yeah. I mean,
I had other plans,
but I canceled them.

650
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:31,063
Good. I thought
I might have scared
you off yesterday.

651
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:35,442
Oh, yeah,
celebrity suicide.

652
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,444
It's kind of weird.

653
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,910
Okay, so check it out.
We're gonna play
a different game today.

654
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,162
Okay.

655
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:51,083
I ask you a question
and you ask me a question.

656
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,419
Do we answer them?

657
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:55,254
It's up to you,
but no matter what,

658
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,548
you have to finish
with a question.

659
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,174
Here we go. You ready?
Yeah.

660
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,512
(CHUCKLES) I said
finish with a question.

661
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:06,056
Are you stupid?

662
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:09,310
Uh, no. . . Are you?

663
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:13,480
There you go.
Do you think
I'm gross looking?

664
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:19,111
No. You look awesome.

665
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,196
What's your question?

666
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,993
Why'd you invite me here?

667
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,662
I thought it was nice
that you loaned
Bobby your shirt.

668
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:32,625
Don't you think
this is a good way
to get to know someone?

669
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:33,834
Sure.

670
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,920
Have you played this before?

671
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,379
Not in here.

672
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,423
Are you a virgin?

673
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,552
(CHUCKLES) So. . .

674
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:45,888
How long have
you been here?

675
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,390
Nice transition, Craig.

676
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,144
Twenty-one days.
Who dragged you here?

677
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:55,189
I checked myself in,
I guess.

678
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:57,858
Kind of, by accident.

679
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,111
The suicide hotline
said to come.

680
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,197
Why are you here so long?

681
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:06,158
They think I might
cut myself again.

682
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,785
Why'd you call
the suicide hotline?

683
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:09,328
I guess. . .

684
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,209
Maybe I didn't really
want to kill myself.

685
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,629
But I kind of did.

686
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:21,715
Does that make sense?

687
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,846
So, where do you go?

688
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:30,766

are you?

00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,606
You guys wear uniforms?

692
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:38,941
I knew it.

693
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:44,154
Okay, sorry, I'm gonna

What do we do now?

698
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:06,218
Are you still playing?

00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:09,513
No. Are you?

700
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,683
I'll race you

Still working on it,
Cool Craig?

(SOFTLY) It's not
what you think.

I think the two of you
were playing the

That's what I think.

Well, I guess it is
what you think then.

710

I thought so.

I'm Craig.

Well, materials
are on the table, Craig.
So just go for it.

That's okay.
I don't really draw.

716
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:05,069
Sure you do.
It doesn't have to
be representative,

717
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,112
it can be abstract,
whatever you want.

what to draw.

How about beavers?

723

draw the sort of beavers
you're talking about.

Tracing paper!
Are you kidding me?

744

Craig, you can't
trace freehand and
expect it to be perfect.

Why not?

Because, honey,
you're five years old.

lnstead of trying to
trace maps of Manhattan,

why don't you just
make up your own maps?

should know more

about my best friend, Aaron.

He's the kind of guy
that Iife just comes
easy to.

He's got a 4.6 GPA.

how that's possibIe.

He was one of

She was a radical

passed the Patriot Act.

the Patriot Act,
then she went bonkers.

put bugs in all the phones.

Relax. It's okay, babe.

1090
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:38,457
But you shouldn't
worry about rejection.

1091
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,668
You shouldn't.
You can practice with me.

1092

Practice what?

1094
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:46,382
No, that's okay.
Yeah, I'll be Noelle.

1095
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:48,384
I'll be Noelle. I'm Noelle.

How's it going?

1098
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:58,143
Hey, Noelle.
I'm well. How are you?

1099
01:04:58,645 --> 01:04:59,687
Oh, good.

1100
01:05:00,939 --> 01:05:01,981
I get out of here soon,

1101
01:05:02,566 --> 01:05:03,816
which is pretty cool.

1102
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:05,985
Do you like music?

1103
01:05:06,987 --> 01:05:08,362
Yeah, sure.

1104
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:11,824
I like live music.

1105
01:05:12,784 --> 01:05:17,162
Uh, you just gonna
sit there the whole time
you're asking her out?

1106
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:18,414
Stand up. I'm a lady.

1107
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:21,959
No, look man.
You gotta loosen
up a little bit.

1108
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:23,168
Come on, loosen up.

1109
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:25,462
Yeah, okay.
Good, good, good.

like to go see live music

You gotta use
more energy, man.

I heard your accountant say
that you tried
to kill yourself.

Well, this may come
as a surprise to you,
Cool Craig, but,

1161
01:08:01,453 --> 01:08:02,870
she ain't my accountant.

1162

Gee, really?

1163
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:09,585
And I've tried to
kill myself six times.

1164
01:08:13,965 --> 01:08:15,674
I thought about doing that,

1165

but I couldn't
make it to the bridge.

1166

I just came straight here.

1167
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:24,850
What stopped you?

1168
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:29,772
My family, I think.
You know, my parents
and my sister.

it would mess them up.

I don't get, Craig.

that loves you.

do just to be you,
for just a day?

I would just. . .

for a walk?

01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:34,493
Um, this is my
roommate, Muqtada.

1247
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:36,036
Don't talk to her!

1248
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,245
She try and
make sex in my bed !

1249
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:39,247
Calm down. No one
was having sex, okay?

1250
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:41,166
Woman is temptress! I know.

1251
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:42,626
What's wrong with you?
MUQTADA: Get out.

1252
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:45,087
Uh, he's going
through a hard time.

1253
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:47,339
No, you !
What's wrong with you?

1254
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:49,132
I'm also going
through a hard time.

1255
01:13:49,217 --> 01:13:51,426
Um, you know what?
You should get some rest,

1256
01:13:51,511 --> 01:13:52,719
and I'll call you
tomorrow or something.

1257
01:13:52,804 --> 01:13:54,346
Nia. Nia, wait.

1258
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:57,557
(MUTTERING)

1259
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:00,685
Wait. Nia.

1260
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:06,066
I love you.

1261
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,403
Just get better, Craig.

1262
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:17,744
No, I mean. . .

1263
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:51,611
Noelle.

1264
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:53,989
Noelle, please.

1265
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:56,283
I'm sorry I messed up.

1266
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:59,119
I love your portrait.
It's amazing.

1267
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:02,622
I wish you'd open the door.

1268
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:06,293
Are you okay?

1269
01:15:15,595 --> 01:15:16,845
Oh. Uh. . .

1270
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:20,932
This is pretty cool, too.

1271
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:25,437
So, our meeting tonight.

1272
01:15:27,148 --> 01:15:29,399
Is it safe to assume
that's not happening?

1273
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:43,413
You've had it figured
out all along, Muqtada.

1274
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:47,876
Never get out of the bed.

1275
01:15:57,345 --> 01:15:58,970
BOBBY: I got in.

1276
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:03,266
ln what?

1277
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:04,851
ln your mama.

1278
01:16:04,936 --> 01:16:05,977
Oh.

1279
01:16:08,481 --> 01:16:10,148
I got in the home.

1280
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:12,817
That's great.

1281
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:17,405
We missed you at breakfast.

1282
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:18,698
(GROANlNG)

1283
01:16:19,617 --> 01:16:22,953
Is this about this
whole Nia/Noelle fiasco?

1284
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:24,955
How do you
know about that?

1285
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:27,499
Solomon. That dude's
got sensitive hearing.

1286
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:29,668
Look, it's not
just women, okay?

1287
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:33,880
I can't do anything right.
My life's a mess.

1288
01:16:34,799 --> 01:16:36,675
No, my life is a mess.

1289
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:41,680
Muqtada's life is a mess.
No offense, babe.

1290
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:43,390
All good, papa.

1291
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:46,518
Look, I happen
to like you, Craig.

1292
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:50,689
You remind me of me
when I was your age.

1293
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:54,234
I was much better looking,
and I didn't have as much
trouble with women. . .

1294
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:56,486
Get back on track, man.

1295
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:59,155
The point is, in 20 years,

1296
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:02,075
if you're celebrating
your daughter's
eighth birthday

1297
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,201
in a place like this,

1298
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:06,913
I swear to God,

1299
01:17:07,665 --> 01:17:09,666
Muqtada and I are going
to kick your ass.

1300
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:14,212
He not busy being born,

1301
01:17:15,548 --> 01:17:17,048
is busy dying.

1302
01:17:21,387 --> 01:17:22,429
You need to believe that.

1303
01:17:28,853 --> 01:17:30,228
This Bobby,

1304
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:33,023
I think, very wise man.

1305
01:17:37,028 --> 01:17:38,278
By the way, I was just
coming in to tell you that

1306
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:39,612
I'm not gonna be
homeless tomorrow.

1307
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:41,906
I'm just saying.

1308
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,119
(DOOR CLOSES)

1309
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,135
BOBBY: And guess what?

1310
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:06,097
It's right next door
to the YMCA.

1311
01:18:06,766 --> 01:18:09,517
Yeah. So we can go swimming
in the swimming pool,

1312
01:18:09,602 --> 01:18:11,728
and maybe play
table tennis.

1313
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:13,938
(CHUCKLES)

1314
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:16,775
Ping-pong, yes.

1315
01:18:17,276 --> 01:18:18,777
It's the same thing.

1316
01:18:18,861 --> 01:18:21,363
So listen, your mom will
bring you by on Saturday,

1317
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:23,114
and we could have a feast.

1318
01:18:57,024 --> 01:18:59,901
There are so many people,
you know, not just
in this hospital,

1319
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:03,696
but in the whole world,
who are struggling
so hard just to live.

1320
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:09,285
And, it's like,
self-indulgent for me to
not appreciate what I have.

1321
01:19:09,829 --> 01:19:10,870
Like what?

1322
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:17,502
Well, there's my family,
my home, and my friends.

1323
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:21,005
And you know,
there's this.

1324
01:19:23,843 --> 01:19:26,928
I used to think art was just
bourgeois decadence, but. . .

1325
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:34,769
It's really wonderful, Craig.

1326
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:36,438
Thanks. Um. . .

1327
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,315
Yeah, I've done
about 20 of them

1328
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,234
and it's something
that I really enjoy.

1329
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:43,361
What do you enjoy about it?

1330
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:45,238
It's fun.

1331
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:49,033
And it takes my mind
off the things
that stress me out.

1332
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:52,036
You gonna continue it
when you leave?

1333
01:19:52,997 --> 01:19:54,080
Yeah.

1334
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:57,959
Or, I think.
But my dad might freak.

1335
01:19:58,294 --> 01:20:00,128
Have you told him
how you feel?

1336
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:01,421
Not yet.

1337
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:02,881
But you will?

1338
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,050
I think so.

1339
01:20:09,096 --> 01:20:10,346
Thank you.

1340
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:17,812
It's my last
night tonight, Smitty.

1341
01:20:17,897 --> 01:20:19,814
It is your
last night, Craig.

1342
01:20:19,899 --> 01:20:23,902
I hate to break it to you,
Craig, but I think
I'm really gonna miss you.

1343
01:20:25,196 --> 01:20:28,448
Well, it's Bobby's
last night, too,

1344
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:31,326
so I was wondering if we
could have a pizza party.

1345
01:20:31,494 --> 01:20:35,413
Yes, we can.
Yeah. Do you have the money?
lf you can get the money.

1346
01:20:35,498 --> 01:20:37,832
Yeah, no, I'll have
the money. Yeah, I. . .

1347
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:39,542
You have records
you could bring?

1348
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:41,169
(VOCALIZING)

1349
01:20:53,516 --> 01:20:56,226
Hey, um, thanks for coming.

1350
01:20:58,938 --> 01:21:02,232
I just wanted to say,
I'm really sorry about
what happened yesterday.

1351
01:21:02,441 --> 01:21:06,069
That girl I was with,
she's my best
friend's girlfriend.

1352
01:21:06,153 --> 01:21:07,820
I've been obsessed
with her forever and. . .

1353
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:09,447
And you're
in love with her?

1354
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:11,157
No.

1355
01:21:11,242 --> 01:21:13,618
Well, of course not.
But you think she's hot,

1356
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:15,745
so you told her what you
thought she'd want to hear.

1357
01:21:17,748 --> 01:21:20,124
And now you're going to
do the same thing to me.

1358
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:21,751
No, I'm not.

1359
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:23,336
You're not?

1360
01:21:28,384 --> 01:21:31,177
Look, um,
I do think you're hot.

1361
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:34,430
And I do want to say
the right thing,

1362
01:21:34,515 --> 01:21:36,975
but that's only
because I really like you.

1363
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:41,646
I like how you don't
hide your problems
like everyone else.

1364
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:45,984
And I feel like I don't
have to hide mine
when I'm around you.

1365
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:51,573
You know, I've been thinking
about it a lot recently,

1366
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:53,366
and I've realized that

1367
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:58,246
if you're not busy being born,
you're busy dying.

1368
01:21:59,623 --> 01:22:02,333
And I, for one,
think that we could
both benefit from

1369
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:05,461
being born, again.

1370
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:09,924
Not being born again,
but you know what I mean?

1371
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:12,176
Gee, thanks for
the wisdom, Bob.

1372
01:22:12,678 --> 01:22:14,512
What? He told you that, too?

1373
01:22:14,847 --> 01:22:16,347
Who?
Bobby.

1374
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:20,101
Yeah, me and about
a billion other people.

1375
01:22:22,563 --> 01:22:23,896
Bob Dylan.

1376
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:28,192
It's the song
you just quoted.

1377
01:22:28,652 --> 01:22:30,320
What? No.
Yes.

1378
01:22:31,113 --> 01:22:32,155
Oh.

1379
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:39,621
Anyway, my point is

1380
01:22:41,165 --> 01:22:42,498
I want to play
doctor with you.

1381
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:03,871
This is awesome.

1382
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:14,340
So, how come you
never asked me why?

1383
01:24:16,135 --> 01:24:17,385
Why what?

1384
01:24:25,102 --> 01:24:29,814
I guess I just
assumed you'd tell me
when you wanted me to know.

1385
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:35,319
Thanks.

1386
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:44,829
Do you like music?

1387
01:24:45,873 --> 01:24:47,331
Do you like breathing?

1388
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:50,293
That's right.
It was a dumb question.

1389
01:24:51,712 --> 01:24:58,134
I like. . . I like
Radiohead a lot,
the Pixies, T. Rex.

1390
01:24:59,011 --> 01:25:00,511
Oh, what else?

1391
01:25:02,473 --> 01:25:04,056
Have you seen them live?

1392
01:25:04,141 --> 01:25:06,851
I saw Radiohead
and the Pixies once.

1393
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:08,519
Cool.

1394
01:25:09,021 --> 01:25:11,022
So, uh. . .

1395
01:25:14,985 --> 01:25:18,654
You know, Vampire Weekend's
doing a show at the end
of the month.

1396
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:24,118
Would you want to go?

1397
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:27,538
Yes, I would.

1398
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:30,041
With you, right?

1399
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:31,751
No, with Solomon.

1400
01:25:32,711 --> 01:25:33,878
Yeah, with me.

1401
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:43,721
CRAIG: Sorry guys. Um...

1402

This is about to
get pretty sappy,

1403
01:25:45,766 --> 01:25:47,850
so I'm just gonna
give you the highIights.

1404
01:25:47,935 --> 01:25:49,685
This is me sharing
the realization that

1405
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:52,772
I don't actuaIIy want to be
a CEO, laWyer, or President.

This is Noelle,

that I once wanted
to be President.

1408
01:25:58,821 --> 01:26:01,531
Here, NoeIIe suggests
I "screw"

1409
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:04,659
the Gates Summer application
if it makes me so unhappy.

1410
01:26:05,202 --> 01:26:07,328
This is me
Iiking that idea.

1411
01:26:08,664 --> 01:26:11,582
This is me thinking about
how to teII my dad.

1412
01:26:12,918 --> 01:26:17,380
This is after I tell Noelle
how beautiful I think she is.

1413
01:26:46,285 --> 01:26:49,579
Okay, just have them
send the delivery guy

Thanks, Dad.

I was a bitch to you.

I'm sorry
I tried to make out
with your girlfriend.

1429
01:27:53,518 --> 01:27:55,144
How are things with Nia?

1430
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,688
Um, we're gonna try
and work through it.

hide it pretty well, but,

1433

I mean, I get that depression
stuff, too, sometimes.
