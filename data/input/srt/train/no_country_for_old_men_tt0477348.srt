1
00:00:37,851 --> 00:00:41,912
I was sheriff of this county
when I was 25 years old.

2
00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:44,014
Hard to believe.

3
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:47,583
My grandfather was a lawman.
Father too.

4
00:00:48,529 --> 00:00:53,432
Me and him was sheriffs at the same
time, him up in Plano and me out here.

5
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,434
I think he's pretty proud of that.

6
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,037
I know I was.

7
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,041
Some of the old-time sheriffs
never even wore a gun.

8
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,739
Folks find that hard to believe.
Jim Scarborough never carried one.

9
00:01:06,813 --> 00:01:08,440
That's the younger Jim.

10
00:01:08,515 --> 00:01:12,975
Gaston Boykins wouldn't wear one
up in Comanche County.

11
00:01:13,053 --> 00:01:16,545
I always liked to hear
about the old-timers.

12
00:01:16,623 --> 00:01:19,615
Never missed a chance to do so.

13
00:01:19,693 --> 00:01:24,255
You can't help but compare yourself
against the old-timers.

14
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:28,165
Can't help but wonder
how they'd have operated these times.

15
00:01:28,235 --> 00:01:33,104
There's this boy I sent to the electric
chair at Huntsville here a while back.

16
00:01:33,173 --> 00:01:36,506
My arrest and my testimony.

17
00:01:37,744 --> 00:01:41,180
He killed a 14-year-old girl.

18
00:01:41,248 --> 00:01:43,739
Paper said it was a crime of passion,

19
00:01:43,817 --> 00:01:46,684
but he told me there
wasn't any passion to it.

20
00:01:46,753 --> 00:01:50,985
Told me he'd planned to kill somebody
for as long as he could remember.

21
00:01:51,058 --> 00:01:53,959
Said if they turned him out,
he'd do it again.

22
00:01:54,027 --> 00:01:56,621
Said he knew he was going to hell.

23
00:01:56,697 --> 00:01:59,097
Be there in about 15 minutes.

24
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,964
I don't know what to make of that.

25
00:02:02,035 --> 00:02:04,265
I sure do don't.

26
00:02:05,505 --> 00:02:10,067
The crime you see now,
it's hard to even take its measure.

27
00:02:10,143 --> 00:02:12,805
It's not that I'm afraid of it.

28
00:02:13,814 --> 00:02:18,581
I always knew you had to be willing
to die to even do this job.

29
00:02:18,652 --> 00:02:22,952
But I don't want to push
my chips forward and go out

30
00:02:23,023 --> 00:02:26,481
and meet something I don't understand.

31
00:02:30,097 --> 00:02:32,964
A man would have
to put his soul at hazard.

32
00:02:34,568 --> 00:02:36,729
He'd have to say, "OK.

33
00:02:40,774 --> 00:02:42,901
I'll be part of this world. "

34
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:47,342
Yes, sir, l just walked in the door.

35
00:02:47,414 --> 00:02:49,507
He had some sort of thing on him,

36
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:53,144
like a oxygen tank
for emphysema or something,

37
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,552
and a hose that run down his sleeve.

38
00:02:55,622 --> 00:02:58,147
Oxygen tank?
What the hell's he got that for?

39
00:02:58,225 --> 00:03:00,989
You got me. Well,
you can look at it when you get in.

40
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:05,498
- I'll be down there in a bit.
- Yes, sir, l got it under control.

41
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:46,254
- Howdy. What's this about?
- Step out of the car please, sir.

42
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,527
What is that?

43
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:49,967
l need you to step out of the car, sir.

44
00:04:57,644 --> 00:04:59,771
- What is that for?
- Would you...?

45
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:02,872
Would you hold still please, sir?

46
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:34,873
You hold still.

47
00:05:44,191 --> 00:05:45,818
Shit.

48
00:09:15,101 --> 00:09:17,035
Agua.

49
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:20,098
Agua.

50
00:09:32,218 --> 00:09:33,947
Agua.

51
00:09:35,822 --> 00:09:37,790
l ain't got no water.

52
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:41,924
Agua.

53
00:09:50,003 --> 00:09:51,561
Agua.

54
00:09:53,073 --> 00:09:54,904
l told you l ain't got no agua.

55
00:10:09,856 --> 00:10:11,084
Do you speak English?

56
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,460
Where's the last guy?

57
00:10:15,528 --> 00:10:20,261
Último hombre, last man standing. There
must have been one. Where'd he go?

58
00:10:26,606 --> 00:10:29,507
l reckon l go out the way l come in.

59
00:10:32,112 --> 00:10:34,672
Hay lobos.

60
00:10:35,381 --> 00:10:37,110
There ain't no lobos.

61
00:10:51,865 --> 00:10:54,891
You stopped to watch
your backtrack.

62
00:10:56,436 --> 00:10:58,802
Now shoot my dumb ass.

63
00:11:01,841 --> 00:11:04,674
But if you stop,

64
00:11:04,744 --> 00:11:06,735
you stopped in shade.

65
00:13:08,902 --> 00:13:10,961
Yeah.

66
00:14:17,637 --> 00:14:20,037
My place is wrong?

67
00:14:20,106 --> 00:14:23,701
Yours is the first place
Danzer and Dora will look if they...

68
00:14:23,776 --> 00:14:25,767
If they know.

69
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,877
- What's in the satchel?
- lt's full of money.

70
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,180
That would be the day.

71
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:36,016
- Where'd you get the pistol?
- At the gettin' place.

72
00:14:37,357 --> 00:14:40,520
- Did you buy that gun?
- No. l found it.

73
00:14:42,795 --> 00:14:45,923
- Llewelyn.
- What? Quit your hollering.

74
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:48,523
What'd you get for that thing?

75
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:52,902
You don't need to know everything,
Carla Jean.

76
00:14:52,972 --> 00:14:56,373
- l need to know that.
- Keep running that mouth of yours,

77
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:59,070
l'm gonna take you in the back
and screw you.

78
00:14:59,145 --> 00:15:02,239
- Big talk.
- Keep it up.

79
00:15:02,315 --> 00:15:05,409
Fine. l don't want to know.

80
00:15:05,485 --> 00:15:09,444
l don't even want to know
where you been all day.

81
00:15:09,522 --> 00:15:11,251
That'll work.

82
00:15:25,238 --> 00:15:26,933
All right.

83
00:15:32,712 --> 00:15:35,078
- Llewelyn?
- Yeah?

84
00:15:37,383 --> 00:15:40,750
- What're you doing, baby?
- l'm going out.

85
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,981
Going where?

86
00:15:43,056 --> 00:15:45,957
A little something l forgot to do,
but l'll be back.

87
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:49,358
- And what're you gonna do?
- l'm fixing to do something

88
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:52,660
dumber than hell, but l'm going anyways.

89
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,268
lf l don't come back,
you tell Mother l love her.

90
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,470
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.

91
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:05,839
Well, then l'll tell her myself.

92
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:02,371
- How much?
- Sixty-nine cents.

93
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:03,931
And the gas?

94
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:06,534
Y'all getting any rain up your way?

95
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,810
- What way would that be?
- Well, l seen you was from Dallas.

96
00:21:13,285 --> 00:21:16,880
What business is it of yours
where l'm from...

97
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,482
...friendo?

98
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:25,152
- Well, l didn't mean nothing by it.
- You didn't mean nothing?

99
00:21:25,231 --> 00:21:27,597
l was just passing the time.

100
00:21:28,868 --> 00:21:32,736
lf you don't want to accept that,
l don't know what else l can do for you.

101
00:21:35,775 --> 00:21:39,211
- Will there be something else?
- l don't know. Will there?

102
00:21:45,618 --> 00:21:47,483
- ls something wrong?
- With what?

103
00:21:47,553 --> 00:21:48,952
With anything.

104
00:21:50,022 --> 00:21:54,186
ls that what you're asking me?
ls there something wrong with anything?

105
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:57,696
- Will there be anything else?
- You already asked me that.

106
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,627
- Well, l need to see about closing now.
- See about closing?

107
00:22:04,703 --> 00:22:06,637
- Yes, sir.
- What time do you close?

108
00:22:06,705 --> 00:22:08,969
- Now. We close now.
- Now is not a time.

109
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:13,171
- What time do you close?
- Generally around dark. At dark.

110
00:22:16,248 --> 00:22:18,978
You don't know what
you're talking about, do you?

111
00:22:19,051 --> 00:22:21,144
Sir?

112
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,883
l said you don't know
what you're talking about.

113
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:29,955
- What time do you go to bed?
- Sir?

114
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:33,624
You're a bit deaf, aren't you?
l said, what time do you go to bed?

115
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:37,335
Oh.

116
00:22:37,937 --> 00:22:41,566
Somewhere around 9:30.
l'd say around 9:30.

117
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,198
l could come back then.

118
00:22:43,275 --> 00:22:45,709
Why would you be coming back?
We'll be closed.

119
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:47,541
Yeah, you said that.

120
00:22:48,781 --> 00:22:53,343
- Well, l got to close now.
- You live in that house out back?

121
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,485
- Yes, l do.
- You lived here all your life?

122
00:22:59,024 --> 00:23:03,154
Well, this is my wife's
father's place, originally.

123
00:23:03,229 --> 00:23:06,858
You married into it?

124
00:23:06,932 --> 00:23:10,834
We lived in Temple, Texas
for many years.

125
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:14,865
Raised a family there. ln Temple.

126
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,036
- We come out here about four years ago.
- You married into it?

127
00:23:19,111 --> 00:23:24,344
- lf that's the way you want to put it.
- Well, l don't have some way to put it.

128
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,145
That's the way it is.

129
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:37,160
What's the most you ever lost
on a coin toss?

130
00:23:37,229 --> 00:23:42,223
- Sir?
- The most you ever lost on a coin toss?

131
00:23:42,301 --> 00:23:45,862
Oh, l don't know. l couldn't say.

132
00:23:48,774 --> 00:23:50,264
- Call it.
- Call it?

133
00:23:50,342 --> 00:23:52,469
- Yes.
- For what?

134
00:23:52,545 --> 00:23:53,773
Just call it.

135
00:23:56,215 --> 00:24:00,015
Well, we need to know
what we're calling it for here.

136
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:03,521
You need to call it.
l can't call it for you.

137
00:24:03,589 --> 00:24:06,683
- Or it wouldn't be fair.
- l didn't put nothing up.

138
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:10,286
Yes, you did. You've been
putting it up your whole life.

139
00:24:10,362 --> 00:24:12,728
You just didn't know it.

140
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:15,824
- You know what date is on this coin?
- No.

141
00:24:15,901 --> 00:24:20,201
1958. lt's been traveling
22 years to get here.

142
00:24:20,272 --> 00:24:25,005
And now it's here.
And it's either heads or tails.

143
00:24:25,077 --> 00:24:26,442
You have to say. Call it.

144
00:24:26,512 --> 00:24:29,948
Well, look,
l need to know what l stand to win.

145
00:24:30,015 --> 00:24:32,848
- Everything.
- How's that?

146
00:24:32,918 --> 00:24:35,512
You stand to win everything. Call it.

147
00:24:39,658 --> 00:24:43,025
All right. Heads, then.

148
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:49,060
Well done.

149
00:24:51,036 --> 00:24:53,163
- Don't put it in your pocket.
- Sir?

150
00:24:53,238 --> 00:24:56,298
Don't put it in your pocket.
lt's your lucky quarter.

151
00:24:56,809 --> 00:24:58,333
Where do you want me to put it?

152
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,537
Anywhere not in your pocket.

153
00:25:00,613 --> 00:25:05,073
Or it'll get mixed in with the others
and become just a coin.

154
00:25:08,087 --> 00:25:09,679
Which it is.

155
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:21,930
Llewelyn?

156
00:25:24,737 --> 00:25:26,534
What the hell?

157
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,903
- Odessa.
- Why would we go to Odessa?

158
00:25:30,976 --> 00:25:34,412
No, not we. You.
You stay with your mother.

159
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,777
Well, how come?

160
00:25:35,848 --> 00:25:40,114
Look, right now it's midnight Sunday.
Courthouse opens nine hours from now.

161
00:25:40,185 --> 00:25:44,281
Someone's gonna call in the number
on the inspection plate of my truck.

162
00:25:44,356 --> 00:25:46,620
And around 9:30,
they'll show up here.

163
00:25:46,692 --> 00:25:49,252
- How long do we...?
- What point would you quit

164
00:25:49,328 --> 00:25:52,525
bothering to look
for your two million dollars?

165
00:25:52,598 --> 00:25:54,793
What am l supposed to tell Mama?

166
00:25:54,867 --> 00:25:57,529
Stand in the door and holler,
"Mama, l'm home!"?

167
00:25:57,603 --> 00:25:59,901
- Llewelyn.
- Come on, pack your things.

168
00:25:59,972 --> 00:26:02,805
Anything you leave,
you ain't gonna see again.

169
00:26:04,076 --> 00:26:08,035
Well, don't fall down apologizing.

170
00:26:08,113 --> 00:26:10,343
Oh, baby, things happen.

171
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,275
Come on, l can't take them back.

172
00:26:36,008 --> 00:26:37,703
Mind riding bitch?

173
00:26:50,589 --> 00:26:52,921
- This his truck?

174
00:26:56,995 --> 00:26:58,792
Got a screwgie?

175
00:27:01,934 --> 00:27:06,564
- Who cut his tires?
- Mexicans, l guess. Wasn't us.

176
00:27:07,372 --> 00:27:10,535
- That is a dead dog.
- Yes, it is.

177
00:27:13,746 --> 00:27:16,806
- Where's the receiver?
- l've got it.

178
00:27:17,483 --> 00:27:20,782
These are some ripe petunias.

179
00:27:20,853 --> 00:27:22,718
Hold this, please.

180
00:27:30,496 --> 00:27:32,293
Want it?

181
00:27:34,433 --> 00:27:38,028
- Getting anything on this?
- Not a bleep.

182
00:27:38,103 --> 00:27:39,798
All right.

183
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:44,300
Give me that.

184
00:27:54,186 --> 00:27:56,814
- l thought it was a car afire.
- lt is a car afire.

185
00:27:56,889 --> 00:28:00,347
Wendell said there's something
in the back country too.

186
00:28:00,425 --> 00:28:01,414
Step in there.

187
00:28:01,493 --> 00:28:04,485
When's the county gonna start
paying rent on my horse?

188
00:28:04,563 --> 00:28:07,657
- l love you more and more every day.
- That's very nice.

189
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:10,662
- Be careful.
- Always am.

190
00:28:10,736 --> 00:28:12,431
- Don't get hurt.
- Never do.

191
00:28:12,504 --> 00:28:14,369
- Don't hurt no one.

192
00:28:16,642 --> 00:28:18,473
lf you say so.

193
00:28:52,744 --> 00:28:56,510
- Wouldn't think a car'd burn like that.
- Yes, sir.

194
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,945
We should've brought wienies.

195
00:28:59,017 --> 00:29:01,952
That look like about
a '77 Ford to you, Wendell?

196
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:05,251
- lt could be.
- l'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.

197
00:29:05,324 --> 00:29:10,318
- The old boy shot by the highway?
- Yes, sir. His vehicle.

198
00:29:10,395 --> 00:29:14,593
Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car,
killed that man on the highway,

199
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:20,104
swapped for his car, now here it is and
he's swapped again for God knows what.

200
00:29:20,172 --> 00:29:22,572
That's very linear, sheriff.

201
00:29:23,609 --> 00:29:26,806
- Age'll flatten a man, Wendell.
- Yes, sir.

202
00:29:26,879 --> 00:29:28,972
- Then there's this other.
- Yeah.

203
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:33,244
- You ride Winston.
- You sure?

204
00:29:33,318 --> 00:29:37,584
Oh, l'm more than sure. lf anything
happens to Loretta's horse out here,

205
00:29:37,656 --> 00:29:41,114
l can tell you, l don't want
to be the party that was aboard.

206
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:46,062
lt's the same tire tread coming back as
going. Made about the same time too.

207
00:29:46,131 --> 00:29:48,292
You can see the sipes real clear.

208
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:54,103
Somebody's pried the inspection plate
off the door on this one.

209
00:29:55,307 --> 00:29:57,935
l know this truck.

210
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:00,570
Belongs to a feller named Moss.

211
00:30:00,646 --> 00:30:03,479
- Llewelyn Moss?
- That's the boy.

212
00:30:03,548 --> 00:30:07,416
- You figure him for a dope runner?
- l don't know.

213
00:30:07,486 --> 00:30:11,252
- l kindly doubt it.
- O.K. Corral is just yonder.

214
00:30:13,358 --> 00:30:16,088
Oh, hell's bells,
they even shot the dog.

215
00:30:19,064 --> 00:30:21,362
This is just
a deal gone wrong, isn't it?

216
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:25,699
Yup. Appears to have been
a glitch or two.

217
00:30:29,308 --> 00:30:33,267
- What calibers you got there, sheriff?
- Nine-millimeter.

218
00:30:33,345 --> 00:30:36,473
Couple of .45 ACPs.

219
00:30:36,548 --> 00:30:40,279
Somebody unloaded on that thing
with a shotgun.

220
00:30:42,754 --> 00:30:45,120
How come the coyotes
ain't been at them?

221
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,283
l don't know.

222
00:30:52,097 --> 00:30:55,032
Supposedly, a coyote
won't eat a Mexican.

223
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,568
These boys appear to be managerial.

224
00:30:58,337 --> 00:31:01,932
l think we're looking at more
than one fracas. Execution here.

225
00:31:02,007 --> 00:31:04,407
Wild West over there.

226
00:31:05,377 --> 00:31:09,814
- lt's that Mexican brown dope.
- Oh, these boys is all swole up.

227
00:31:09,881 --> 00:31:12,748
So this was earlier.
Getting set to trade.

228
00:31:12,818 --> 00:31:14,683
Then, whoa, differences, and...

229
00:31:15,988 --> 00:31:19,754
- Might not even a been no money.
- That's possible.

230
00:31:19,825 --> 00:31:23,124
- But you don't believe it?
- No.

231
00:31:23,195 --> 00:31:25,493
Probably l don't.

232
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:30,227
Well, it's a mess, ain't it, sheriff?

233
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:35,005
lf it ain't,
it'll do till the mess gets here.

234
00:33:28,854 --> 00:33:30,879
Yes, sir?

235
00:33:30,956 --> 00:33:35,017
- l'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
- Did you go up to his trailer?

236
00:33:35,093 --> 00:33:37,994
- Yes, l did.
- Well, l'd say he's at work.

237
00:33:38,063 --> 00:33:41,032
- Do you want to leave a message?
- Where does he work?

238
00:33:41,099 --> 00:33:43,158
l can't say.

239
00:33:44,936 --> 00:33:46,062
Where does he work?

240
00:33:46,138 --> 00:33:50,632
Sir, l ain't at liberty to give out
no information about our residents.

241
00:33:51,776 --> 00:33:52,902
Where does he work?

242
00:33:53,678 --> 00:33:56,010
Did you not hear me?

243
00:33:56,081 --> 00:33:59,141
We can't give out no information.

244
00:34:21,273 --> 00:34:25,437
- Why all the way to Del Rio?
- l'm gonna borrow a car from Roberto.

245
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:29,446
- You can't afford one?
- l don't want to register it.

246
00:34:29,514 --> 00:34:32,210
- Look, l'll call you in a couple days.
- Promise?

247
00:34:32,284 --> 00:34:33,273
Yes, l do.

248
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:39,388
- l got a bad feeling, Llewelyn.
- l got a good one. Oughta even out.

249
00:34:39,457 --> 00:34:42,858
Listen, you gotta quit
your worrying so much.

250
00:34:42,928 --> 00:34:44,828
- Mama's gonna raise hell.

251
00:34:44,896 --> 00:34:46,887
She's just gonna cuss you up and down.

252
00:34:46,965 --> 00:34:50,765
- Well, you should be used to that.
- l'm used to lots of things.

253
00:34:50,835 --> 00:34:53,804
- l work at Wal-Mart.
- Not anymore, Carla Jean.

254
00:34:53,872 --> 00:34:55,772
You are retired.

255
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,740
- Llewelyn?
- Yes, ma'am?

256
00:34:59,811 --> 00:35:04,475
- You are coming back, ain't you?
- l shall return.

257
00:35:09,221 --> 00:35:11,519
Sheriff's department!

258
00:35:13,525 --> 00:35:15,516
Look at that lock.

259
00:35:17,929 --> 00:35:20,659
- We going in?
- Gun out and up.

260
00:35:24,302 --> 00:35:27,271
- What about yours?
- l'm hiding behind you.

261
00:35:30,308 --> 00:35:32,367
Sheriff's department!

262
00:35:58,136 --> 00:36:01,333
- l believe they done lit a shuck.
- l believe you're right.

263
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:05,540
- That from the lock?
- Probably must be.

264
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:09,273
- So when was he here, sheriff?
- l don't know. Oh...

265
00:36:09,347 --> 00:36:11,838
- Now that's aggravating.
- Sheriff?

266
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:17,821
- Still sweating.
- Oh, sheriff! We just missed him!

267
00:36:18,857 --> 00:36:22,156
We gotta circulate this on radio.

268
00:36:22,227 --> 00:36:23,455
All right.

269
00:36:24,529 --> 00:36:26,588
What do we circulate?

270
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:32,564
Looking for a man
who has recently drunk milk?

271
00:36:35,307 --> 00:36:39,869
- Oh, sheriff, that's aggravating.
- l'm ahead of you there.

272
00:36:41,846 --> 00:36:45,714
Think this boy Moss has got any notion
of the sorts of sons-of-bitches

273
00:36:45,784 --> 00:36:48,719
- that are hunting him?
- l don't know. He ought to.

274
00:36:52,223 --> 00:36:56,853
He's seen the same things l've seen and
it certainly made an impression on me.

275
00:37:03,134 --> 00:37:05,432
- Take me to a motel.
- Got one in mind?

276
00:37:05,503 --> 00:37:06,765
Someplace cheap.

277
00:37:08,807 --> 00:37:12,368
- You tell me the option.
- Do what now?

278
00:37:12,444 --> 00:37:16,073
You pick the option
goes with the applicable rate.

279
00:37:17,449 --> 00:37:20,646
l'm just one person,
so it don't matter the size of the bed.

280
00:37:26,324 --> 00:37:29,760
This is Roberto's
Automotive. I'm not in right now.

281
00:37:29,828 --> 00:37:31,557
Please leave a message.

282
00:39:30,648 --> 00:39:34,414
- Hello?
- ls Llewelyn there?

283
00:39:34,486 --> 00:39:37,922
Llewelyn? No, he ain't.

284
00:39:37,989 --> 00:39:39,923
You expect him?

285
00:39:39,991 --> 00:39:43,791
Now why would
I expect him? Who is this?

286
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:54,805
- May l help you?
- Yeah, you got a pair of Larry Mahans?

287
00:39:54,873 --> 00:39:56,238
Shoulder, size 11?

288
00:39:56,307 --> 00:39:58,969
- l'll check.
- You all sell socks?

289
00:39:59,043 --> 00:40:02,535
- Just white.
- Well, white's all l wear. Bathroom?

290
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,805
Don't stop.
Just ride me up past those rooms.

291
00:40:31,876 --> 00:40:35,903
- What room?
- Just drive me around.

292
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,278
l wanna see if someone's here.

293
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,781
Keep going. Don't stop.

294
00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:50,828
l don't wanna get into
some kind of a jackpot here.

295
00:40:50,895 --> 00:40:52,829
lt's all right.

296
00:40:52,897 --> 00:40:56,594
Why don't l just set you down
right here and we won't argue about it?

297
00:40:56,668 --> 00:40:59,967
- Take me to another motel.
- Let's just call it square.

298
00:41:00,038 --> 00:41:03,166
You're in the jackpot,
and l'm trying to get you out of it.

299
00:41:03,241 --> 00:41:05,300
Take me to another motel.

300
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:56,791
Lab reports from Austin
on that boy by the highway.

301
00:41:56,861 --> 00:41:59,056
- What was the bullet?
- Wasn't no bullet.

302
00:42:00,732 --> 00:42:04,259
- Wasn't no bullet?
- Yes, sir. Wasn't none.

303
00:42:04,335 --> 00:42:09,272
Well, Wendell, with all due respect,
that don't make a lot of sense.

304
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,466
No, sir.

305
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:14,671
You said entry wound in the forehead,
no exit wound.

306
00:42:14,746 --> 00:42:17,010
- Yes, sir.
- You telling me he shot this boy

307
00:42:17,081 --> 00:42:19,413
and then went digging around
with a knife?

308
00:42:21,019 --> 00:42:23,817
- Sir, l don't wanna picture that.
- l don't either.

309
00:42:23,888 --> 00:42:26,220
Can l freshen that there for you,
sheriff?

310
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:29,225
Yeah, Maureen, you better had.

311
00:42:29,293 --> 00:42:32,023
Ranger and the DEA
are headed back out to the scene.

312
00:42:32,096 --> 00:42:34,690
Gonna join 'em?

313
00:42:34,766 --> 00:42:37,326
Any new bodies accumulate out there?

314
00:42:38,636 --> 00:42:41,730
- No, sir.
- Well, then l guess l can skip it.

315
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:00,554
- Twelve-gauge. You need shells?
- Yeah, double-ought.

316
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:04,459
- Yeah, that'll give you a wallop.
- Y'all got camping supplies?

317
00:43:04,529 --> 00:43:07,828
Tent poles. You already have the tent?

318
00:43:07,899 --> 00:43:09,662
Well, something like that.

319
00:43:09,734 --> 00:43:12,601
Give me the model number on the tent,
l can order poles.

320
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:15,070
- Never mind. l want a tent.
- What kind?

321
00:43:15,139 --> 00:43:17,130
The kind with most poles.

322
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:42,190
- Could l get another room?
- You wanna change rooms?

323
00:43:42,266 --> 00:43:44,928
No, ma'am, l wanna keep my room
and get another one.

324
00:43:45,002 --> 00:43:47,493
- Another additional?
- Yes, ma'am.

325
00:43:47,572 --> 00:43:49,938
And do you have a map of the rooms?

326
00:43:50,007 --> 00:43:52,669
Well, yeah, we had a sorta one.

327
00:43:54,579 --> 00:43:56,604
Oh, thank you.

328
00:43:59,984 --> 00:44:01,975
How about 38?

329
00:44:02,053 --> 00:44:06,717
Well, you can have the one right next to
yours if you want, 137. lt ain't took.

330
00:44:06,791 --> 00:44:10,852
- No, 38 will be fine.
- Well, that's got two double beds.

331
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:47,487
How'd you find that?

332
00:52:34,965 --> 00:52:37,866
You shouldn't be doin' that.

333
00:52:37,935 --> 00:52:41,462
Even a young man like you.

334
00:52:41,538 --> 00:52:45,201
- Doin' what?
- Hitchhiking.

335
00:52:50,981 --> 00:52:52,676
Dangerous.

336
00:53:10,701 --> 00:53:14,228
You know Anton Chigurh by sight,
is that correct?

337
00:53:14,305 --> 00:53:17,832
Yes, sir, l know him every which way.

338
00:53:17,908 --> 00:53:20,274
When did you last see him?

339
00:53:21,912 --> 00:53:25,075
...November 28th, last year.

340
00:53:25,149 --> 00:53:28,414
Seem pretty sure of the date.
Did l ask you to sit?

341
00:53:29,219 --> 00:53:33,315
No, sir, but you struck me as a man
who wouldn't wanna waste a chair.

342
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:38,885
l remember dates, names, numbers.
l saw him November the 28th.

343
00:53:41,031 --> 00:53:42,726
Got a loose cannon here.

344
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,236
We're out a bunch of money,
and the other party is out his product.

345
00:53:46,303 --> 00:53:49,170
- Yes, sir.
- This account will give up

346
00:53:49,239 --> 00:53:53,539
$1,200 in any 24-hour period.
That's up from a thousand.

347
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:57,774
lf your expenses run higher,
l hope you'll trust us for it.

348
00:53:57,848 --> 00:53:59,941
OK.

349
00:54:00,017 --> 00:54:03,783
- Just how well do you know Chigurh?
- What do you wanna know?

350
00:54:03,854 --> 00:54:07,756
l just wanna know your opinion of him,
in general.

351
00:54:07,825 --> 00:54:13,286
- Just how dangerous is he?
- Compared to what, the bubonic plague?

352
00:54:13,364 --> 00:54:15,559
He's bad enough you called me.

353
00:54:15,632 --> 00:54:20,126
Yeah, he's a psychopathic killer,
but so what?

354
00:54:20,204 --> 00:54:22,001
There's plenty of them around.

355
00:54:22,072 --> 00:54:24,768
Killed three men
in a Del Rio motel yesterday,

356
00:54:24,842 --> 00:54:28,437
and two others in that
colossal goat-fuck out in the desert.

357
00:54:28,512 --> 00:54:31,447
- We can stop that.
- Seem pretty sure of yourself.

358
00:54:33,784 --> 00:54:38,084
You've led something of a charmed life,
haven't you, Mr. Wells?

359
00:54:38,155 --> 00:54:43,422
ln all honesty, l can't say that charm
has had a whole lot to do with it.

360
00:54:45,095 --> 00:54:47,529
- l was wondering...
- Yes?

361
00:54:48,465 --> 00:54:50,592
Could you validate my parking ticket?

362
00:54:53,003 --> 00:54:57,235
- An attempt at humor, l suppose?
- l'm sorry.

363
00:55:02,012 --> 00:55:07,382
You know, l counted the floors
to this building from the street.

364
00:55:07,451 --> 00:55:09,976
- And?
- There's one missing.

365
00:55:12,956 --> 00:55:14,685
We'll look into it.

366
00:55:34,611 --> 00:55:37,512
One room. One night.

367
00:55:37,581 --> 00:55:41,210
- That'll be $26.
- Alrighty.

368
00:55:45,289 --> 00:55:46,551
You on all night?

369
00:55:46,623 --> 00:55:49,854
Yes, sir, l'll be right here
till 10:00 in the morning.

370
00:55:51,495 --> 00:55:55,955
This here's for you. Now, l ain't
asking you to do anything illegal.

371
00:55:56,033 --> 00:55:59,059
There's someone
who been looking for me. Not police.

372
00:55:59,136 --> 00:56:01,866
You just call me
if anyone else checks in tonight.

373
00:56:01,939 --> 00:56:04,134
And by anyone, l mean any swinging dick.

374
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:48,777
There just ain't no way.

375
01:02:26,423 --> 01:02:29,017
Don't worry, l ain't gonna hurt you.

376
01:02:29,092 --> 01:02:30,923
l need you
to drive me on outta here.

377
01:05:38,014 --> 01:05:40,278
- Why not?
- l don't know, man.

378
01:06:03,973 --> 01:06:06,066
Were you in a car accident?

379
01:06:08,011 --> 01:06:10,377
l'll give you 500 bucks for that coat.

380
01:06:12,082 --> 01:06:13,208
Lemme see the money.

381
01:06:16,252 --> 01:06:17,742
Were you in a car accident?

382
01:06:20,056 --> 01:06:22,456
- Yeah.
- OK, give me the money.

383
01:06:22,525 --> 01:06:26,461
- lt's right here. Give me the clothes.
- Let him hold the money.

384
01:06:33,203 --> 01:06:34,761
Give it here.

385
01:06:42,645 --> 01:06:43,771
Gimme that beer too.

386
01:06:46,649 --> 01:06:48,276
How much?

387
01:06:49,018 --> 01:06:50,815
Brian, give him the beer.

388
01:09:02,952 --> 01:09:04,442
Médico...

389
01:09:05,688 --> 01:09:07,713
...por favor.

390
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:12,577
Wait up!

391
01:11:15,051 --> 01:11:18,418
...and I had a 44 inch waist.
My diet specialist got a hold of me,

392
01:11:18,488 --> 01:11:20,649
and that first week,
I lost seven pounds!

393
01:11:20,723 --> 01:11:24,284
Looking back on the diet, it was
relatively easy to lose the weight,

394
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:28,194
though it did have moments. Sometimes,
it looked as if I gained weight

395
01:11:28,264 --> 01:11:31,700
instead of lost it.
The most difficult part is still ahead.

396
01:11:31,768 --> 01:11:34,134
Keeping weight off
now that we've lost it.

397
01:11:34,203 --> 01:11:36,569
It's natural
for you to gain a few pounds.

398
01:11:36,639 --> 01:11:40,268
But as soon as you do,
make sure you go on...

399
01:12:37,567 --> 01:12:41,799
Here are a few points to remember.
First of all, weigh in every day.

400
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,059
Any word on those vehicles yet?

401
01:13:13,135 --> 01:13:16,161
Sheriff, l found out
everything there was to find.

402
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:20,801
Those vehicles are titled
and registered to deceased people.

403
01:13:20,877 --> 01:13:23,368
The owner of that Bronco's
been dead 20 years.

404
01:13:23,446 --> 01:13:25,676
Want me to find out
about the Mexican ones?

405
01:13:25,748 --> 01:13:28,546
No. Lord, no.

406
01:13:28,618 --> 01:13:30,677
There's this month's checks.

407
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:34,212
That DEA agent called again.
You don't wanna talk to him?

408
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:36,986
Gonna try to keep from it much as l can.

409
01:13:37,059 --> 01:13:40,051
Going back. Wanted to know
if you wanted to go with him.

410
01:13:40,129 --> 01:13:41,357
That's cordial of him.

411
01:13:43,299 --> 01:13:44,960
Can l get you to call Loretta,

412
01:13:45,034 --> 01:13:47,730
tell her l'm going to Odessa
to see Carla Jean Moss?

413
01:13:47,803 --> 01:13:50,795
- Yes, sheriff.
- l'll call her when l get there.

414
01:13:50,873 --> 01:13:53,603
l'd call now, but if she
want me to come home, l might.

415
01:13:53,676 --> 01:13:56,474
Do you want me to wait
till you quit the building?

416
01:13:56,546 --> 01:14:00,277
Uh-huh. Don't wanna lie without
what it's absolutely necessary.

417
01:14:03,853 --> 01:14:06,378
What is it Torbert says
about truth and justice?

418
01:14:07,089 --> 01:14:11,082
Oh, we dedicate ourselves daily anew.
Something like that.

419
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:14,186
l'm gonna commence
dedicating myself twice daily.

420
01:14:14,263 --> 01:14:17,096
- Might come to three before it's over.

421
01:14:18,568 --> 01:14:19,899
What the hell?

422
01:14:28,744 --> 01:14:30,109
Sheriff?

423
01:14:30,646 --> 01:14:32,705
You looked at your load lately?

424
01:14:34,283 --> 01:14:38,811
- That is a damn outrage.
- One of those tie-downs worked loose.

425
01:14:38,888 --> 01:14:44,190
- How many bodies did you leave with?
- l ain't lost none of 'em, sheriff.

426
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:46,626
Couldn't y'all have
taken a van out there?

427
01:14:46,696 --> 01:14:49,062
We didn't have no van
with four-wheel drive.

428
01:14:49,131 --> 01:14:51,827
You gonna write me up
for improperly secured load?

429
01:14:51,901 --> 01:14:53,801
You get your ass outta here.

430
01:14:56,906 --> 01:15:00,205
- Buenos días.

431
01:15:00,276 --> 01:15:03,871
l'm guessing this isn't the future
you had pictured for yourself

432
01:15:03,946 --> 01:15:06,540
when you first clapped eyes
on that money.

433
01:15:06,983 --> 01:15:09,747
Don't worry.
l'm not the man who's after you.

434
01:15:11,153 --> 01:15:13,053
l know that.

435
01:15:14,423 --> 01:15:15,549
l've seen him.

436
01:15:15,625 --> 01:15:18,958
You've seen him?
And you're not dead?

437
01:15:19,829 --> 01:15:21,194
Huh.

438
01:15:21,263 --> 01:15:24,027
What's this guy supposed to be,
the ultimate badass?

439
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:26,193
Don't think that's how l'd describe him.

440
01:15:26,268 --> 01:15:28,133
How would you describe him?

441
01:15:28,204 --> 01:15:32,402
l guess l'd say
he doesn't have a sense of humor.

442
01:15:32,475 --> 01:15:35,035
- His name's Chigurh.
- Sugar?

443
01:15:35,111 --> 01:15:37,579
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh.

444
01:15:37,647 --> 01:15:40,980
- You know how he found you?
- Yeah, l know how he found me.

445
01:15:41,050 --> 01:15:44,247
- lt's called a transponder.
- l know what it's called.

446
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:47,016
- He won't find me again.
- Not that way.

447
01:15:47,089 --> 01:15:49,922
- Not any way.
- Took me about three hours.

448
01:15:49,992 --> 01:15:54,656
- Yeah, well, l been immobile.
- No. You don't understand.

449
01:15:56,966 --> 01:16:00,265
- What do you do?
- l'm retired.

450
01:16:00,336 --> 01:16:03,100
- What did you do?
- Welder.

451
01:16:03,172 --> 01:16:05,436
- Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
- Any of it.

452
01:16:05,508 --> 01:16:08,033
- lf it can be welded, l can weld it.
- Cast iron?

453
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:09,907
- Yeah.
- l don't mean braze.

454
01:16:09,979 --> 01:16:11,913
- l didn't say braze.
- Pot metal?

455
01:16:11,981 --> 01:16:13,448
What did l say?

456
01:16:15,017 --> 01:16:19,716
- Were you in 'Nam?
- Yeah, l was 'Nam.

457
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:23,581
So was l.

458
01:16:23,659 --> 01:16:25,991
So, what does that make me, your buddy?

459
01:16:27,596 --> 01:16:32,795
Look, you gotta give me this money.
l got no other reason to protect you.

460
01:16:33,736 --> 01:16:36,569
lt's too late. l spent it.

461
01:16:37,573 --> 01:16:39,939
A million and a half
on whores and whiskey,

462
01:16:40,009 --> 01:16:42,773
and the rest of it,
l just sorta blew it in.

463
01:16:44,647 --> 01:16:47,115
How do you know he's not
on his way to Odessa?

464
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:55,222
- Why would he go to Odessa?
- Kill your wife.

465
01:17:02,531 --> 01:17:06,934
Maybe he's the one
that needs to be worried... about me.

466
01:17:07,002 --> 01:17:08,663
He isn't.

467
01:17:08,738 --> 01:17:12,367
Yeah. You're not cut out for this.

468
01:17:12,441 --> 01:17:15,933
You're just a guy
who happened to find those vehicles.

469
01:17:21,784 --> 01:17:24,048
l'm across the river at the Hotel Eagle.

470
01:17:25,087 --> 01:17:27,555
Carson Wells.

471
01:17:27,623 --> 01:17:29,614
Call me when you've had enough.

472
01:17:29,692 --> 01:17:32,661
l can even let you keep
a little of the money.

473
01:17:32,728 --> 01:17:36,129
lf l was into cutting deals,
why wouldn't l deal with Sugar?

474
01:17:36,198 --> 01:17:40,635
No, no, you don't understand.
You can't make a deal with him.

475
01:17:40,703 --> 01:17:45,504
Even if you gave him the money, he'd
still kill you for inconveniencing him.

476
01:17:45,574 --> 01:17:47,769
He's a peculiar man.

477
01:17:47,843 --> 01:17:52,940
Might even say he has principles,
principles that transcend money or drugs

478
01:17:53,015 --> 01:17:56,678
or anything like that. Not like you.

479
01:17:57,553 --> 01:17:59,953
Yeah. He's not even like me.

480
01:18:00,022 --> 01:18:03,617
No, he don't talk as much as you.
l give him points for that.

481
01:18:06,362 --> 01:18:08,626
Carla Jean, thank you for coming.

482
01:18:08,697 --> 01:18:10,460
Don't know why l did.

483
01:18:10,533 --> 01:18:13,468
l told you, l don't know where he is.

484
01:18:13,536 --> 01:18:15,868
- You haven't heard from him?
- No, l ain't.

485
01:18:15,938 --> 01:18:17,735
- Nothing?
- Not word one.

486
01:18:17,807 --> 01:18:22,005
- Would you tell me if you had?
- Well, l don't know.

487
01:18:22,077 --> 01:18:26,912
- He don't need any trouble from you.
- lt ain't me he's in trouble with.

488
01:18:26,982 --> 01:18:30,577
- Who's he in trouble with then?
- Some pretty bad people.

489
01:18:30,653 --> 01:18:34,384
These people will kill him, Carla Jean.
They won't quit.

490
01:18:34,456 --> 01:18:37,482
He won't neither. He never has.

491
01:18:38,227 --> 01:18:41,628
- He can take all comers.

492
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:46,828
You know Charlie Walser's
got that place out east of Sanderson?

493
01:18:48,637 --> 01:18:52,698
You know how he used to slaughter
beeves, hit 'em right there with a maul,

494
01:18:52,775 --> 01:18:54,606
truss 'em and slit their throats?

495
01:18:54,677 --> 01:18:57,840
Charlie's got one all trussed up,
all set to drain him

496
01:18:57,913 --> 01:19:00,211
and the beef comes to,
thrashing around.

497
01:19:01,150 --> 01:19:03,812
Six hundred pounds
of very pissed off livestock.

498
01:19:03,886 --> 01:19:06,480
You'll excuse the... Well...

499
01:19:06,555 --> 01:19:09,115
Charlie grabs a gun,
shoot the thing in the head,

500
01:19:09,191 --> 01:19:12,217
but with the swinging and thrashing,
it's a glance shot.

501
01:19:12,294 --> 01:19:14,922
Ricochets, hits Charlie in the shoulder.

502
01:19:14,997 --> 01:19:18,626
You go see Charlie, he still can't
pick up his right hand for his hat.

503
01:19:18,701 --> 01:19:22,933
The point being, that even in
the contest between man and steer,

504
01:19:23,005 --> 01:19:24,802
the issue is not certain.

505
01:19:32,481 --> 01:19:37,145
When Llewelyn calls,
just tell him l can make him safe.

506
01:19:40,990 --> 01:19:45,723
'Course, they slaughter
steers a lot different these days.

507
01:19:45,794 --> 01:19:49,890
Use a air gun. Shoots out a little rod
about that far under the brain.

508
01:19:49,965 --> 01:19:53,093
Sucks right back in.
Animal never knows what hit him.

509
01:19:56,071 --> 01:19:59,837
- Why are you telling me that, sheriff?
- l don't know.

510
01:20:03,445 --> 01:20:05,208
My mind wanders.

511
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:30,625
Hello, Carson.

512
01:21:32,935 --> 01:21:34,527
Let's go to your room.

513
01:21:46,849 --> 01:21:49,443
You don't have to do this.

514
01:21:49,518 --> 01:21:53,545
l'm a day trader.
l could just go home.

515
01:21:55,491 --> 01:21:58,358
- You could.
- Make it worth your while,

516
01:21:58,427 --> 01:22:02,625
take you to an ATM.
There's 14 grand in it.

517
01:22:02,698 --> 01:22:05,030
And everybody just walks away.

518
01:22:06,368 --> 01:22:08,461
An ATM.

519
01:22:12,474 --> 01:22:15,568
l know where the satchel is.

520
01:22:15,644 --> 01:22:17,908
lf you knew, you would have it with you.

521
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:21,882
l can find it from the river bank.
l know where it is.

522
01:22:23,419 --> 01:22:26,354
- l know something better.
- What's that?

523
01:22:26,422 --> 01:22:27,912
Where it's going to be.

524
01:22:29,558 --> 01:22:33,085
- Where's that?
- lt will be brought to me

525
01:22:33,162 --> 01:22:35,653
and placed at my feet.

526
01:22:37,533 --> 01:22:40,468
You don't know to a certainty.

527
01:22:40,536 --> 01:22:44,495
- ln 20 minutes it could be here.
- l do know to a certainty.

528
01:22:44,573 --> 01:22:47,269
And you know what's
gonna happen now, Carson?

529
01:22:48,343 --> 01:22:52,973
You should admit your situation.
There would be more dignity in it.

530
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:00,953
- You go to hell.

531
01:23:01,790 --> 01:23:05,055
All right.
Let me ask you something.

532
01:23:06,862 --> 01:23:11,629
lf the rule you followed
brought you to this,

533
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:14,294
of what use was the rule?

534
01:23:19,875 --> 01:23:23,777
Do you have any idea how crazy you are?

535
01:23:24,947 --> 01:23:27,313
You mean the nature
of this conversation?

536
01:23:27,382 --> 01:23:29,543
l mean the nature of you.

537
01:23:33,856 --> 01:23:39,692
You... You can have the money, Anton.

538
01:24:19,768 --> 01:24:22,134
- Hello?
- Yes?

539
01:24:23,805 --> 01:24:27,036
ls, uh, Carson Wells there?

540
01:24:29,278 --> 01:24:31,769
Not in the sense that you mean.

541
01:24:33,949 --> 01:24:37,942
- You need to come see me.
- Who is this?

542
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:41,012
You know who it is.

543
01:24:41,089 --> 01:24:44,252
- You need to talk to me.
- I don't need to talk to you.

544
01:24:44,326 --> 01:24:46,658
l think you do.

545
01:24:46,728 --> 01:24:48,457
Do you know where l'm going?

546
01:24:48,530 --> 01:24:51,124
Why would l care where you're going?

547
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:53,862
l know where you are.

548
01:24:53,936 --> 01:24:56,131
Yeah, where am I?

549
01:24:56,205 --> 01:25:00,471
You're in the hospital across the river,
but that's not where l'm going.

550
01:25:01,376 --> 01:25:03,469
Do you know where l'm going?

551
01:25:05,314 --> 01:25:09,341
- Yeah, I know where you're going.
- All right.

552
01:25:09,418 --> 01:25:10,976
You know she won't be there.

553
01:25:11,053 --> 01:25:13,521
lt doesn't make any difference
where she is.

554
01:25:13,589 --> 01:25:15,750
So, what're you going up there for?

555
01:25:19,394 --> 01:25:21,919
You know how this is gonna turn out,
don't you?

556
01:25:23,899 --> 01:25:25,423
Nope.

557
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:29,766
l think you do.
So this is what l'll offer.

558
01:25:30,772 --> 01:25:33,332
You bring me the money,
and l'll let her go.

559
01:25:33,408 --> 01:25:38,072
Otherwise, she's accountable,
the same as you.

560
01:25:40,182 --> 01:25:42,582
That's the best deal you're gonna get.

561
01:25:42,651 --> 01:25:46,587
l won't tell you you can save yourself,
because you can't.

562
01:25:49,858 --> 01:25:53,294
Yeah, l'm gonna bring you something,
all right.

563
01:25:53,362 --> 01:25:55,523
Decided to make you a project of mine.

564
01:25:55,597 --> 01:25:58,259
You ain't gonna have
to come look for me at all.

565
01:26:02,571 --> 01:26:05,131
- The motel in Del Rio?
- Yes, sir.

566
01:26:05,207 --> 01:26:06,970
None of the three had lD on 'em,

567
01:26:07,042 --> 01:26:10,808
but they're tellin' me that all three
is Mexican... was Mexicans.

568
01:26:10,879 --> 01:26:15,748
There's a question,
whether they stopped being and when.

569
01:26:17,753 --> 01:26:19,687
Yes, sir.

570
01:26:19,755 --> 01:26:22,349
Wendell, did you inquire
about the lock cylinder?

571
01:26:22,424 --> 01:26:25,052
- Yes, sir. lt was punched out.
- OK.

572
01:26:25,894 --> 01:26:28,886
- Wanna drive out there?
- No, that's all l had to look for,

573
01:26:28,964 --> 01:26:31,489
it sound like these boys
died of natural causes.

574
01:26:31,566 --> 01:26:35,502
- How's that, sheriff?
- Natural to the line of work they in.

575
01:26:35,570 --> 01:26:38,437
- Yes, sir.
- My God, Wendell, it's all-out war.

576
01:26:38,507 --> 01:26:42,500
l can't think of any other word for it.
Who are these people?

577
01:26:42,577 --> 01:26:46,035
Here, last week they found
this couple out in California.

578
01:26:46,114 --> 01:26:49,845
They rent out rooms to old people,
kill 'em, bury 'em in the yard,

579
01:26:49,918 --> 01:26:52,216
cash their Social Security checks.

580
01:26:53,255 --> 01:26:56,418
Oh, they'd torture 'em first.
l don't know why.

581
01:26:57,592 --> 01:26:59,719
Maybe their television set was broke.

582
01:26:59,795 --> 01:27:03,162
And this went on until, here, l quote,

583
01:27:03,231 --> 01:27:07,133
"Neighbors were alerted
when a man ran from the premises

584
01:27:07,202 --> 01:27:09,193
wearing only a dog collar."

585
01:27:10,939 --> 01:27:13,931
You can't make up such
a thing as that. l dare you to try.

586
01:27:14,009 --> 01:27:17,706
But that's what it took, you notice,
to get somebody's attention.

587
01:27:17,779 --> 01:27:20,509
Digging graves in the backyard
didn't bring any.

588
01:27:27,222 --> 01:27:30,953
Well, that's all right.
l laugh myself sometimes.

589
01:27:33,061 --> 01:27:35,086
Ain't a whole lot else you can do.

590
01:27:37,699 --> 01:27:39,690
Tell me something.

591
01:27:39,768 --> 01:27:42,760
Who gets through this gate
into the United States?

592
01:27:44,539 --> 01:27:47,064
l don't know. American citizens?

593
01:27:47,142 --> 01:27:50,043
Some American citizens.
Who do you think decides?

594
01:27:50,112 --> 01:27:52,103
- You do, l reckon.
- That is correct.

595
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:54,478
- How do l decide?
- l don't know.

596
01:27:54,549 --> 01:27:58,485
l ask questions. lf l get sensible
answers, then they get to go to America.

597
01:27:58,553 --> 01:27:59,918
lf l don't, they don't.

598
01:27:59,988 --> 01:28:02,047
- Anything you don't understand?
- No.

599
01:28:02,124 --> 01:28:04,786
l ask again, how you come
to be here with no clothes?

600
01:28:06,194 --> 01:28:07,752
Well, l got an overcoat on.

601
01:28:09,030 --> 01:28:10,964
- Are you jacking with me?
- No, sir.

602
01:28:11,032 --> 01:28:13,091
- Don't jack with me.
- Yes, sir.

603
01:28:13,702 --> 01:28:15,897
- You in the service?
- No, l'm a veteran.

604
01:28:15,971 --> 01:28:18,439
- 'Nam?
- Yes, sir, two tours.

605
01:28:18,507 --> 01:28:21,101
- What outfit?
- Twelfth lnfantry Battalion,

606
01:28:21,176 --> 01:28:24,771
August 7th, 1966, July 2nd, 1968.

607
01:28:27,449 --> 01:28:30,418
- Wilson!
- Yes, sir!

608
01:28:30,485 --> 01:28:34,046
Get someone to help this man.
He needs to get into town.

609
01:28:43,064 --> 01:28:46,500
- How those Larry's holdin' up?
- Good, good.

610
01:28:46,568 --> 01:28:49,128
- l need everything else.
- OK.

611
01:28:49,704 --> 01:28:52,798
Have a lot of people come
in here without any clothes on?

612
01:28:52,874 --> 01:28:55,206
No, sir. lt's unusual.

613
01:29:08,190 --> 01:29:11,682
- She don't want to talk to you.
- Yes, she does. Put her on.

614
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:14,285
- Do you know what time it is?
- l don't care,

615
01:29:14,362 --> 01:29:16,660
and don't you hang up this phone.

616
01:29:16,731 --> 01:29:19,894
Discombobulated
by a no-account son-in-law.

617
01:29:21,069 --> 01:29:22,934
- Llewelyn?
- Hey, you.

618
01:29:23,004 --> 01:29:26,167
- What should l do?
- You know what's going on?

619
01:29:26,241 --> 01:29:29,972
l don't know. l had the sheriff here
from Terrell County. He...

620
01:29:30,045 --> 01:29:33,344
- What'd you tell him?
- What did I know to tell him?

621
01:29:34,049 --> 01:29:37,212
- You're hurt, ain't you?

622
01:29:37,285 --> 01:29:39,549
What makes you say that?

623
01:29:39,621 --> 01:29:43,182
- I can hear it in your voice.
- It's falseness in his voice!

624
01:29:43,258 --> 01:29:46,853
Look, l want you to meet me at
the Desert Sands Motel in El Paso.

625
01:29:46,928 --> 01:29:49,396
l'm gonna give you the money,
put you on a plane.

626
01:29:49,464 --> 01:29:51,898
Llewelyn, l ain't gonna
leave you in the lurch.

627
01:29:51,967 --> 01:29:55,164
This works better. With you
gone and l don't have the money,

628
01:29:55,237 --> 01:29:58,035
he can't touch me,
but l can sure touch him.

629
01:29:58,106 --> 01:30:00,768
And after l find him,
l'll come and join you.

630
01:30:00,842 --> 01:30:04,300
Find who?
What am I supposed to do with mother?

631
01:30:04,379 --> 01:30:06,279
- She'll be all right.
- All right?

632
01:30:06,348 --> 01:30:08,873
Be all right? I got the cancer!

633
01:30:08,950 --> 01:30:10,918
Ain't nobody gonna bother her.

634
01:30:45,487 --> 01:30:46,977
Who are you?

635
01:30:51,359 --> 01:30:53,190
- Me?
- Yes.

636
01:30:53,261 --> 01:30:55,456
Nobody.

637
01:30:55,530 --> 01:30:57,225
Accounting.

638
01:30:58,667 --> 01:31:01,135
He gave the Mexicans a receiver.

639
01:31:03,471 --> 01:31:05,439
He feels...

640
01:31:05,507 --> 01:31:09,136
He felt that the more people looking...

641
01:31:09,210 --> 01:31:14,147
That's foolish.
You pick the one right tool.

642
01:31:14,215 --> 01:31:15,614
l see.

643
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:20,147
Are you going to shoot me?

644
01:31:26,394 --> 01:31:28,191
That depends.

645
01:31:30,565 --> 01:31:32,157
Do you see me?

646
01:31:35,303 --> 01:31:37,897
l always seen this
is what it'd come to.

647
01:31:37,973 --> 01:31:42,273
- Three years ago, l pre-visioned it.
- lt ain't three years we been married.

648
01:31:42,344 --> 01:31:46,542
Three years ago l said
them very words, "no" and "good."

649
01:31:46,615 --> 01:31:50,278
Here we are, 90 degree heat,

650
01:31:50,352 --> 01:31:55,756
l got the cancer and look at this,
not even a home to go to.

651
01:31:56,458 --> 01:31:59,256
We're going to El Paso, Texas.

652
01:31:59,327 --> 01:32:02,490
You know how may people
l know in El Paso, Texas?

653
01:32:02,564 --> 01:32:05,499
- No, ma'am.
- That's how many.

654
01:32:14,442 --> 01:32:17,673
- l didn't see my prednisone.
- l put it in, Mama.

655
01:32:17,746 --> 01:32:21,477
- Well, l didn't see it.
- Well, l put it in that one.

656
01:32:21,549 --> 01:32:25,383
You just set there. l'll get tickets
and a cart for the bags.

657
01:32:25,453 --> 01:32:27,614
You need help with the bags, madam?

658
01:32:27,689 --> 01:32:31,591
Well, thank God, there is
one gentleman left in west Texas.

659
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:34,424
Yes, thank you.
l am old and l am not well!

660
01:32:34,496 --> 01:32:39,195
- Which bus are you taking?
- Going to El Paso, don't ask me why.

661
01:32:39,267 --> 01:32:42,202
lt's not often you see
a Mexican in a suit.

662
01:32:42,270 --> 01:32:44,830
You go to El Paso? l know it.
Where are you staying?

663
01:32:44,906 --> 01:32:46,203
Oh...

664
01:32:46,274 --> 01:32:48,037
Carla Jean, how are you?

665
01:32:48,109 --> 01:32:52,102
Sheriff, was that a true story
about Charlie Walser?

666
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:54,671
Who's Charlie Walser? Uh! Oh...

667
01:32:54,749 --> 01:32:56,842
Um...

668
01:32:56,918 --> 01:32:59,478
True story.
l couldn't swear to every detail,

669
01:32:59,554 --> 01:33:03,081
- but it's certainly true it is a story.
- Yeah, right.

670
01:33:03,158 --> 01:33:06,992
Sheriff, can you give me
your word on something?

671
01:33:07,062 --> 01:33:08,996
Yes, ma'am.

672
01:33:09,064 --> 01:33:13,694
lf l tell you where Llewelyn's headed,
you promise it'll be just you

673
01:33:13,768 --> 01:33:16,931
who goes and talks with him?
You and nobody else.

674
01:33:17,005 --> 01:33:20,941
- Yes, ma'am, l do.
- Llewelyn would never ask for help.

675
01:33:21,009 --> 01:33:23,876
He never thinks he needs any.

676
01:33:23,945 --> 01:33:27,847
Carla Jean, I will not harm your man.

677
01:33:27,916 --> 01:33:31,352
And he needs help,
whether he knows it or not.

678
01:33:40,295 --> 01:33:42,388
What's the problem there, neighbor?

679
01:33:42,464 --> 01:33:46,833
Yep, that'll suck some power, over time.

680
01:33:48,636 --> 01:33:52,402
- You from around here?
- Yeah, Alpine, born and bred.

681
01:33:52,474 --> 01:33:56,535
- Here you go.
- What airport would you use?

682
01:33:56,611 --> 01:34:00,809
- Well, airport or airstrip?
- Airport.

683
01:34:00,882 --> 01:34:04,648
- Well, where you goin'?
- l don't know.

684
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:09,179
Just lightin' out for the territories,
huh? Brother, l been there.

685
01:34:09,724 --> 01:34:12,955
Well, there's airstrips.

686
01:34:13,027 --> 01:34:15,359
The airport is El Paso.

687
01:34:15,430 --> 01:34:17,227
lf you want someplace specific,

688
01:34:17,298 --> 01:34:21,257
you might could be better off just
driving to Dallas, not have to connect.

689
01:34:21,336 --> 01:34:23,531
You gonna clamp them, buddy?

690
01:34:23,605 --> 01:34:26,506
Can you get those chicken crates
out of the bed?

691
01:34:26,574 --> 01:34:29,441
What are you talking about?

692
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:49,353
Hey, Mr. Sportin' Goods.

693
01:34:49,430 --> 01:34:53,389
- Hey, yourself.
- You a sport?

694
01:34:53,468 --> 01:34:55,868
Yeah, that's me.

695
01:34:55,937 --> 01:34:58,735
l got beers in my room.

696
01:34:58,807 --> 01:35:02,709
- Oh, uh, l'm... l'm waiting on my wife.
- Oh.

697
01:35:02,777 --> 01:35:05,610
That's who you keep
looking out the window for?

698
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:08,308
- Well, half.
- What else then?

699
01:35:08,383 --> 01:35:13,218
- Just looking for what's comin'.
- Yeah.

700
01:35:13,288 --> 01:35:15,984
But no one ever sees that.

701
01:35:16,057 --> 01:35:19,356
Beer! That's what's comin'.

702
01:35:19,427 --> 01:35:22,225
l'll bring the ice chest out.
You can stay married.

703
01:35:22,297 --> 01:35:24,788
No, ma'am, l know what beer leads to.

704
01:35:26,634 --> 01:35:28,761
Beer leads to more beer.

705
01:36:15,683 --> 01:36:17,150
You all right?

706
01:36:22,423 --> 01:36:24,288
Call the police.

707
01:36:30,131 --> 01:36:32,395
Your local law enforcement.

708
01:36:33,735 --> 01:36:35,726
l'm not on their radio.

709
01:36:35,803 --> 01:36:38,533
l met his daughter at the...

710
01:37:25,987 --> 01:37:29,184
Buy you a cup of coffee
'fore you drive home?

711
01:37:29,257 --> 01:37:32,818
- No money in his room there?
- Couple hundred, on his person.

712
01:37:32,894 --> 01:37:35,226
Those hombres
would have taken the stash.

713
01:37:35,296 --> 01:37:37,856
l suppose so.

714
01:37:37,932 --> 01:37:40,093
Though they was leavin' in a hurry.

715
01:37:40,168 --> 01:37:45,367
lt's all the goddamn money, Ed Tom.
Money and the drugs.

716
01:37:46,541 --> 01:37:49,203
lt's just goddamn beyond everything.

717
01:37:49,944 --> 01:37:53,175
What's it mean? What's it leading to?

718
01:37:53,247 --> 01:37:56,307
You know,
if you'd have told me 20 years ago

719
01:37:56,384 --> 01:37:59,512
l'd see children walking
the streets of our Texas towns

720
01:37:59,587 --> 01:38:02,715
with green hair, bones in their noses,

721
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:05,350
l just flat-out
wouldn't have believed you.

722
01:38:05,426 --> 01:38:06,984
Signs and wonders.

723
01:38:07,061 --> 01:38:11,623
But l think once you quit hearing "sir"
and "ma'am," the rest is soon to foller.

724
01:38:11,699 --> 01:38:13,428
- Oh, it's the tide.
- Yeah.

725
01:38:13,501 --> 01:38:17,335
lt's the dismal tide.
lt is not the one thing.

726
01:38:17,405 --> 01:38:18,997
Not the one thing.

727
01:38:19,073 --> 01:38:21,940
Yeah, well,
none of that explains your man, though.

728
01:38:22,010 --> 01:38:25,138
Well, he's just a goddamn
homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.

729
01:38:25,213 --> 01:38:28,580
- l'm not sure he's a lunatic.
- Well, what would you call him?

730
01:38:28,649 --> 01:38:32,016
Well, sometimes
l think he's pretty much a ghost.

731
01:38:32,086 --> 01:38:34,020
- He's real, all right.
- Oh, yeah?

732
01:38:34,088 --> 01:38:37,854
Yeah. All of that over at
the Eagle Hotel? Just beyond everything.

733
01:38:37,925 --> 01:38:40,485
Yeah. Got some hard bark on him.

734
01:38:40,561 --> 01:38:43,462
Why... Well, that don't hardly say it.

735
01:38:44,665 --> 01:38:46,496
He shoots a desk clerk one day,

736
01:38:46,567 --> 01:38:51,061
walks right back in the next
and shoots a retired Army colonel.

737
01:38:51,139 --> 01:38:52,629
lt's hard to believe.

738
01:38:52,707 --> 01:38:55,972
Just strolls right back
into a crime scene.

739
01:38:56,044 --> 01:39:01,414
Now, who'd do such a thing?
How do you defend against it?

740
01:39:01,482 --> 01:39:04,474
Well, good trip, Ed Tom.

741
01:39:04,552 --> 01:39:06,952
Sorry we couldn't help your boy.

742
01:42:39,066 --> 01:42:42,297
- ln back!
- How'd you know l was here?

743
01:42:42,370 --> 01:42:45,464
Who else'd be driving up in your truck?

744
01:42:45,539 --> 01:42:47,097
- You heard it?
- How's that?

745
01:42:47,174 --> 01:42:51,372
Did you hear my...?
You're having fun with me.

746
01:42:51,445 --> 01:42:55,814
What give you that idea?
l seen one of the cats heard it.

747
01:42:55,883 --> 01:43:00,684
- How'd you know it was my truck?
- l deduced it when you walked in.

748
01:43:00,755 --> 01:43:02,916
How many of them things you got now?

749
01:43:02,990 --> 01:43:05,515
Cats? Oh, l don't know, several.

750
01:43:05,593 --> 01:43:08,892
Well, it depends
on what you mean by "got."

751
01:43:08,963 --> 01:43:13,195
Some of 'em are half wild,
some of 'em are just outlaws.

752
01:43:16,270 --> 01:43:20,001
- How you been, Ellis?
- You're looking at it.

753
01:43:21,375 --> 01:43:24,674
l got to say, you're looking older.

754
01:43:24,745 --> 01:43:26,269
l am older.

755
01:43:27,415 --> 01:43:29,883
Got a letter from your wife.

756
01:43:29,950 --> 01:43:34,387
She writes me pretty regular,
keeps me up on the family news.

757
01:43:34,455 --> 01:43:38,152
- Didn't know there was any.
- Told me you're quittin'.

758
01:43:41,228 --> 01:43:44,129
- You want a cup?
- Appreciate it.

759
01:43:51,639 --> 01:43:53,470
How fresh is that coffee?

760
01:43:53,541 --> 01:43:59,275
l generally make a fresh pot every week,
even if there's some left over.

761
01:44:01,215 --> 01:44:03,547
That man that shot you died in prison?

762
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:08,150
Angola. Yeah.

763
01:44:08,222 --> 01:44:11,020
What'd you done he'd a been released?

764
01:44:11,092 --> 01:44:13,993
Oh, l don't know. Nothing.

765
01:44:14,061 --> 01:44:15,688
Wouldn't be no point in it.

766
01:44:15,763 --> 01:44:19,028
Kindly surprised to hear you say that.

767
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:22,831
Well, all the time
you spend trying to get back

768
01:44:22,903 --> 01:44:26,566
what's been took from you,
more is going out the door.

769
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:29,609
After a while, you have
to try to get a tourniquet on it.

770
01:44:30,678 --> 01:44:34,808
Your granddad never asked me
to sign on as a deputy.

771
01:44:37,618 --> 01:44:41,645
Loretta tells me you're quittin'.
How come you doing that?

772
01:44:41,722 --> 01:44:44,020
l don't know.

773
01:44:46,727 --> 01:44:48,388
l feel overmatched.

774
01:44:52,967 --> 01:44:55,561
l always figured when l got older,

775
01:44:55,636 --> 01:45:00,539
God would... sort of
come into my life somehow.

776
01:45:03,544 --> 01:45:04,602
And He didn't.

777
01:45:08,482 --> 01:45:10,109
And l don't blame Him.

778
01:45:12,486 --> 01:45:15,421
lf l was Him, l'd have
the same opinion of me that He does.

779
01:45:16,056 --> 01:45:17,853
You don't know what He thinks.

780
01:45:32,072 --> 01:45:35,803
l sent Uncle Mac's thumbbuster and badge
over to the Rangers,

781
01:45:35,876 --> 01:45:38,504
put it in their museum.

782
01:45:38,579 --> 01:45:42,208
Your daddy ever tell you
how Uncle Mac come to his reward?

783
01:45:43,284 --> 01:45:46,845
Gunned down on his own porch
over in Hudspeth County.

784
01:45:49,089 --> 01:45:53,958
Seven or eight of 'em come up there,
all wanting this, wanting that.

785
01:45:54,028 --> 01:45:56,997
Uncle Mac went back in the house
to get the shotgun.

786
01:45:57,064 --> 01:46:00,693
Well, they was ahead of him.

787
01:46:00,768 --> 01:46:03,498
Shot him in his doorway.

788
01:46:03,571 --> 01:46:06,165
Aunt Ella come out,
tried to stop the bleeding.

789
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:10,176
Uncle Mac all the while
trying to get that shotgun.

790
01:46:10,244 --> 01:46:14,681
They just sat there on their horses,
watching him die.

791
01:46:15,783 --> 01:46:19,947
After a while, one of 'em said
something in lndian and they turned.

792
01:46:20,855 --> 01:46:22,652
Left out.

793
01:46:24,825 --> 01:46:28,317
Uncle Mac knew the score,
even if Aunt Ella didn't.

794
01:46:28,395 --> 01:46:31,523
Shot through the left lung.

795
01:46:31,599 --> 01:46:36,127
And that was that... as they say.

796
01:46:39,406 --> 01:46:40,703
When'd he die?

797
01:46:41,976 --> 01:46:45,343
Nineteen zero and, uh... nine?

798
01:46:45,412 --> 01:46:49,246
No, l mean,
was it right away or in the night or...

799
01:46:49,316 --> 01:46:53,013
- When was it?
- l believe it was that night.

800
01:46:53,087 --> 01:46:58,115
She buried him the next morning.
Digging in that hard old caliche.

801
01:47:01,061 --> 01:47:03,825
What you got ain't nothin' new.

802
01:47:04,965 --> 01:47:07,661
This country is hard on people.

803
01:47:11,405 --> 01:47:13,532
You can't stop what's coming.

804
01:47:15,342 --> 01:47:17,401
lt ain't all waitin' on you.

805
01:47:20,247 --> 01:47:22,112
That's vanity.

806
01:48:23,043 --> 01:48:25,409
l knew this wasn't done with.

807
01:48:28,248 --> 01:48:30,148
l ain't got the money.

808
01:48:32,186 --> 01:48:36,418
What little l had is long gone
and there's bills aplenty to pay yet.

809
01:48:38,359 --> 01:48:42,887
l buried my mother today.
Ain't paid for that neither.

810
01:48:43,897 --> 01:48:45,762
l wouldn't worry about it.

811
01:48:48,402 --> 01:48:49,960
l need to sit down.

812
01:49:05,252 --> 01:49:07,345
You got no cause to hurt me.

813
01:49:07,421 --> 01:49:11,255
No. But l gave my word.

814
01:49:12,693 --> 01:49:16,322
- You gave your word?
- To your husband.

815
01:49:19,333 --> 01:49:22,097
That don't make sense.

816
01:49:22,169 --> 01:49:25,400
You gave your word
to my husband to kill me?

817
01:49:25,472 --> 01:49:28,964
Your husband had
the opportunity to save you.

818
01:49:29,043 --> 01:49:31,910
lnstead, he used you
to try to save himself.

819
01:49:36,917 --> 01:49:38,908
Not like that.

820
01:49:40,487 --> 01:49:42,318
Not like you say.

821
01:49:48,395 --> 01:49:50,192
You don't have to do this.

822
01:49:50,264 --> 01:49:52,528
People always say the same thing.

823
01:49:54,268 --> 01:49:55,530
What do they say?

824
01:49:56,637 --> 01:49:58,867
They say, "You don't have to do this."

825
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:05,103
- You don't.
- OK.

826
01:50:10,217 --> 01:50:12,208
This is the best l can do.

827
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:14,309
Call it.

828
01:50:18,826 --> 01:50:22,421
l knowed you was crazy
when l saw you sitting there.

829
01:50:24,832 --> 01:50:27,460
l knowed exactly
what was in store for me.

830
01:50:27,534 --> 01:50:31,868
- Call it.
- No.

831
01:50:31,939 --> 01:50:34,464
l ain't gonna call it.

832
01:50:37,845 --> 01:50:39,244
Call it.

833
01:50:39,313 --> 01:50:42,373
The coin don't have no say.

834
01:50:42,449 --> 01:50:44,314
lt's just you.

835
01:50:46,854 --> 01:50:49,948
Well, l got here
the same way the coin did.

836
01:52:32,559 --> 01:52:35,722
Mister, you got
a bone sticking out of your arm.

837
01:52:35,796 --> 01:52:38,196
l'm all right.
Let me just sit here a minute.

838
01:52:38,265 --> 01:52:41,200
There's an ambulance coming.
The man went to call.

839
01:52:41,268 --> 01:52:43,566
All right.

840
01:52:43,637 --> 01:52:47,471
Are you all right?
You got a bone sticking out your arm.

841
01:52:48,742 --> 01:52:50,710
What'll you take for the shirt?

842
01:52:55,282 --> 01:52:58,251
Well, hell, mister,
l'll give you my shirt.

843
01:53:05,259 --> 01:53:08,717
Look at that fucking bone.

844
01:53:08,795 --> 01:53:09,955
Tie this for me.

845
01:53:11,064 --> 01:53:13,032
Just tie it, just tie it.

846
01:53:31,051 --> 01:53:35,078
Hell, mister.
Look, l don't mind helping someone out.

847
01:53:35,155 --> 01:53:37,646
- That's a lot of money.
- Take it.

848
01:53:37,724 --> 01:53:40,852
Take it and... you didn't see me.

849
01:53:40,928 --> 01:53:43,192
- l was already gone.

850
01:53:43,263 --> 01:53:44,560
Yes, sir.

851
01:53:48,969 --> 01:53:52,496
- Part of that's mine, right?
- You still got your damn shirt.

852
01:53:52,572 --> 01:53:56,975
- Ain't even what it was for.
- Maybe. But l'm still out a shirt.

853
01:54:17,097 --> 01:54:19,725
- Maybe l'll go ridin'.
- OK.

854
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:23,668
- What do you think?
- Well, l can't plan your day.

855
01:54:24,938 --> 01:54:28,465
- l mean, would you care to join me?
- Lord, no, l'm not retired.

856
01:54:30,510 --> 01:54:34,913
- Maybe l'll help out here then.
- Uh... better not.

857
01:54:39,219 --> 01:54:42,552
- How'd you sleep?
- l don't know. Had dreams.

858
01:54:42,622 --> 01:54:46,991
Well, you got time for 'em now.
Anything interesting?

859
01:54:47,060 --> 01:54:49,893
They always is to the party concerned.

860
01:54:52,132 --> 01:54:54,726
Ed Tom, l'll be polite.

861
01:54:57,170 --> 01:55:02,267
All right, then. Two of 'em, both
had my father in 'em. lt's peculiar.

862
01:55:02,342 --> 01:55:05,334
l'm older now
than he ever was by 20 years.

863
01:55:05,412 --> 01:55:09,280
So, in a sense, he's the younger man.

864
01:55:09,349 --> 01:55:12,443
Anyway, the first one
l don't remember too well,

865
01:55:12,519 --> 01:55:15,249
but it was about meeting him in town,

866
01:55:15,322 --> 01:55:17,916
somewheres,
and he give me some money.

867
01:55:17,991 --> 01:55:19,618
l think l lost it.

868
01:55:21,428 --> 01:55:26,331
Second one, it was like we
was both back in older times.

869
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:30,496
And l was a-horseback,
going through the mountains of a night.

870
01:55:30,570 --> 01:55:34,006
Going through this pass
in the mountains.

871
01:55:34,074 --> 01:55:37,475
lt was cold,
and there was snow on the ground.

872
01:55:37,544 --> 01:55:40,012
And he rode past me and kept on going,

873
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:42,844
never said nothing going by,
just rode on past.

874
01:55:44,484 --> 01:55:48,284
He had his blanket wrapped around him
and his head down.

875
01:55:50,090 --> 01:55:54,083
When he rode past,
l seen he was carrying fire in a horn,

876
01:55:54,161 --> 01:55:56,061
the way people used to do, and l...

877
01:55:56,129 --> 01:55:58,723
l could see the horn
from the light inside of it,

878
01:55:58,799 --> 01:56:00,528
'bout the color of the moon.

879
01:56:02,035 --> 01:56:04,367
And, in the dream, l knew that he was...

880
01:56:05,238 --> 01:56:07,035
...going on ahead.

881
01:56:07,641 --> 01:56:12,510
He was fixin' to make a fire somewhere
out there in all that dark and cold.

882
01:56:16,116 --> 01:56:19,108
And l knew that whenever l got there,
he'd be there.

883
01:56:23,657 --> 01:56:25,625
And then l woke up.
