1
00:00:26,796 --> 00:00:31,050
Let us praise famous men

2
00:00:31,134 --> 00:00:34,220
and our fathers that begat us.

3
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:39,600
All these men were honoured
in their generations

4
00:00:39,684 --> 00:00:43,521
and were a glory in their days.

5
00:00:43,604 --> 00:00:47,525
We are here today to give thanks

6
00:00:47,608 --> 00:00:51,362
for the life of Harold Abrahams.

7
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,450
To honour the legend.

8
00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:59,871
Now there are just two of us,

9
00:00:59,954 --> 00:01:04,041
young Aubrey Montague and myself,

10
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,711
who can close our eyes

11
00:01:06,794 --> 00:01:10,798
and remember those few young men

12
00:01:10,882 --> 00:01:13,468
with hope in our hearts

13
00:01:13,551 --> 00:01:16,679
and wings on our heels.

14
00:03:54,712 --> 00:04:00,134
"Carlton Hotel, Broadstairs, Kent.
28th June, 1924."

15
00:04:00,468 --> 00:04:05,765
"Dear Mum, I'm most awfully sorry
about your cold and the general dreariness. "

16
00:04:05,848 --> 00:04:08,351
"We're having quite bad weather here too. "

17
00:04:08,434 --> 00:04:11,646
"Thanks for your letters.
I'm sorry you are disappointed

18
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:15,149
that I let the Olympic Games
interfere with my shorthand. "

19
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:18,694
"But if you were my age,
with a chance at the world championship,

20
00:04:18,778 --> 00:04:21,697
you'd be just as big a fool as I am. "

21
00:04:21,781 --> 00:04:23,866
"We've just one week to go now. "

22
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,036
"It hardly seems that
since we arrived at Cambridge,

23
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,040
never suspecting
what extraordinary times lay ahead. "

24
00:04:31,124 --> 00:04:35,711
"Mind you, Harold has hardly changed at all -
as intense as ever. "

25
00:04:35,795 --> 00:04:38,840
"Now, as then, having a go
at anybody who stands in his way. "

26
00:04:38,923 --> 00:04:42,301
I suppose a taxi's out of the question, is it?

27
00:04:42,385 --> 00:04:45,096
- Do you need some help?
- I'll say.

28
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:47,974
- Let me have those clubs.
- That's jolly kind.

29
00:04:48,057 --> 00:04:50,101
Don't mention it.

30
00:04:51,144 --> 00:04:53,396
Right.

31
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:55,606
- All set?
- You sure you're all right?

32
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,943
- I'm fine. Lead on.
- Thanks.

33
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,699
Sorry? The clubs and things?
It's all show, really, though I do enjoy it.

34
00:05:04,782 --> 00:05:06,701
- I take it you're not keen.
- I run.

35
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:09,829
- Really? So do I.
- I'm surprised you find the time.

36
00:05:09,912 --> 00:05:17,003
- Trouble is, I can't stand getting beaten. You?
- I don't know, I've never lost. Top pocket.

37
00:05:17,086 --> 00:05:19,589
- Thank you.
- Carry your suitcase, sir?

38
00:05:19,672 --> 00:05:22,508
Yes. Yes, of course. Yes.

39
00:05:22,592 --> 00:05:24,969
This way.

40
00:05:25,052 --> 00:05:28,055
- Which college, sir?
- Gonville and Caius.

41
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,517
- The same.
- This way, please, gents.

42
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:34,103
There we are.

43
00:05:34,187 --> 00:05:37,940
- Here, give me that.
- Thanks.

44
00:05:39,942 --> 00:05:43,696
Come along, Bill.
Let's get these cases over here.

45
00:05:44,739 --> 00:05:47,033
That's the way.

46
00:05:47,116 --> 00:05:49,494
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

47
00:05:49,577 --> 00:05:50,620
Thanks very much.

48
00:05:50,703 --> 00:05:52,371
Yes. Thank you.

49
00:05:52,455 --> 00:05:55,041
Good luck.

50
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,098
That's what we fought the bleeding war for.
Give shits like them a decent education.

51
00:06:10,181 --> 00:06:12,600
Hey, come on.

52
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:49,262
I'll take these.

53
00:06:52,515 --> 00:06:55,435
- See you inside, Aubrey.
- Right.

54
00:07:03,609 --> 00:07:05,278
- Name, please?
- We're new.

55
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:07,613
I can see that, laddie. What's your name?

56
00:07:07,697 --> 00:07:10,450
Abrahams. HM.

57
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:14,328
- Top of the list. Repton. That the one?
- That's it. Left a year ago.

58
00:07:14,412 --> 00:07:16,497
Been doing your bit? France?

59
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:19,417
- No. Joined too late.
- Bad luck, lad.

60
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,961
Many a dead man would've liked a share of it.

61
00:07:22,044 --> 00:07:25,506
You're right there, son.

62
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,758
Welcome to Caius.

63
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:30,720
Sign here.

64
00:07:30,803 --> 00:07:33,055
Thank you.

65
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:36,392
Across the courtyard,
right-hand corner, up the stairs.

66
00:07:36,476 --> 00:07:39,520
Thanks. By the way, what are your names?

67
00:07:39,604 --> 00:07:43,232
Rogers, head porter,
and this is Mr Ratcliffe, my assistant.

68
00:07:43,316 --> 00:07:48,446
Mr Rogers, Ratcliffe, I ceased to be "laddie"
when I took up the King's commission.

69
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:53,284
- Is that clear?
- Yes... Mr Abrahams. Quite clear.

70
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:56,954
Thank you. I'd be obliged
if you'd remember it.

71
00:07:57,038 --> 00:07:59,957
- See you later.
- Fine.

72
00:08:01,334 --> 00:08:05,880
What's your friend studying, then, son?
Barrack-room law?

73
00:08:05,963 --> 00:08:08,257
I've no idea.

74
00:08:08,341 --> 00:08:14,931
One thing's certain - a name like Abrahams,
he won't be in the chapel choir, now, will he?

75
00:08:15,264 --> 00:08:17,517
- Name?
- Montague.

76
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,144
- What?
- Montague.

77
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:11,237
I take the war list

78
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,739
and I run down it.

79
00:09:13,823 --> 00:09:16,909
Name after name which I cannot read

80
00:09:16,993 --> 00:09:20,663
and which we, who are older than you,

81
00:09:20,746 --> 00:09:23,583
cannot hear without emotion.

82
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:29,755
Names which will be only names
to you, the new college,

83
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,136
but which, to us, summon up face after face,

84
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:40,266
full of honesty and goodness,

85
00:09:40,349 --> 00:09:43,019
zeal and vigour

86
00:09:43,102 --> 00:09:45,438
and intellectual promise.

87
00:09:46,481 --> 00:09:50,651
The flower of a generation.
The glory of England.

88
00:09:50,735 --> 00:09:55,573
And they died for England
and all that England stands for.

89
00:09:56,616 --> 00:10:01,621
And now, by tragic necessity,
their dreams have become yours.

90
00:10:01,704 --> 00:10:04,999
Let me exhort you - examine yourselves.

91
00:10:05,082 --> 00:10:10,379
Let each of you discover
where your true chance of greatness lies.

92
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:17,887
For their sakes, for the sake of your college
and your country, seize this chance,

93
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:24,727
rejoice in it, and let no power or persuasion
deter you in your task.

94
00:10:27,605 --> 00:10:30,942
Thursday, October 10th, 1919.

95
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:36,197
My first day at Cambridge was rounded off
by the freshmen's dinner. A sumptuous affair.

96
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:42,370
The master gave us a moving speech and I'm
now eagerly awaiting the start of term proper.

97
00:10:42,453 --> 00:10:45,164
Rugby club, golfing society, tennis,

98
00:10:45,248 --> 00:10:48,501
squash club, flora and fauna, philately.

99
00:10:48,584 --> 00:10:52,380
- Is that all? You're idle.
- I can't join everything. I must work.

100
00:10:52,463 --> 00:10:56,092
- Bird watching. Take a book.
- How can I watch if I'm reading?

101
00:10:56,175 --> 00:10:58,845
Follow in the footsteps ofWG.
Any Yorkshiremen?

102
00:10:58,928 --> 00:11:03,516
- There you are, Stallard.
- I can't bat for toffee.

103
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,869
- Abrahams.
- Can you manage tenor?

104
00:11:22,952 --> 00:11:27,748
- We're short of tenors.
- Only under torture. Aubrey? Sing, do you?

105
00:11:27,832 --> 00:11:30,001
- School choir, that's all.
- Stallard?

106
00:11:30,084 --> 00:11:33,463
Not on your life. They kicked me out
of "Ring-a-ring o' Roses".

107
00:11:33,546 --> 00:11:35,423
Sorry. We can't all be gifted.

108
00:11:40,595 --> 00:11:43,097
- Put my friend down as well.
- Steady on.

109
00:11:43,181 --> 00:11:45,850
Splendid. Rehearsals start Monday. lolanthe.

110
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:51,105
- I was a boy alto.
- Perfect. You can be Queen of the Fairies.

111
00:11:52,732 --> 00:11:56,611
We have a solemn duty
to those lives needlessly slaughtered.

112
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:10,625
Glad to have you. Good middle-distance men
don't grow on trees.

113
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:14,128
I can't vouch for those times.

114
00:12:14,212 --> 00:12:17,465
Taken with the school alarm clock,
most of them.

115
00:12:17,548 --> 00:12:21,552
Give or take a second,
they're good enough for me.

116
00:12:21,636 --> 00:12:25,014
Have you come across
a fellow called HM Abrahams?

117
00:12:25,098 --> 00:12:28,851
- He's challenged for the college dash.
- What's so special about that?

118
00:12:28,935 --> 00:12:33,815
It's special because in 700 years, nobody's
ever done it. Right, what do you do?

119
00:12:50,998 --> 00:12:54,001
Right, chaps, thank you. Thank you.

120
00:12:55,002 --> 00:13:00,007
HM Abrahams of Gonville and Caius has
formally made challenge for the college dash.

121
00:13:01,968 --> 00:13:03,761
You show 'em, Harold.

122
00:13:03,845 --> 00:13:07,056
For those unfamiliar with the rules,
they are as follows.

123
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:12,145
The challenger will run around the court
perimeter, to and from a fixed point,

124
00:13:12,228 --> 00:13:15,648
within the time taken
by the clock to strike midday,

125
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:19,318
a distance traditionally recognised
as one of 188 paces.

126
00:13:19,402 --> 00:13:23,197
I say, Abrahams,
what have you got on your feet? Rockets?

127
00:13:23,281 --> 00:13:27,118
- The challenge will commence on...
- You haven't got a chance.

128
00:13:27,201 --> 00:13:29,287
Do it for Israel.

129
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:34,459
The challenge commences on the stroke
of one. He must finish before the stroke of 12.

130
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:39,797
- Come on, Abrahams, you swank.
- Will the challenger make himself ready?

131
00:13:47,305 --> 00:13:50,808
This Abrahams,
what do you know about him?

132
00:13:50,892 --> 00:13:56,147
Repton chap. Jewish.
His father's a financier in the city.

133
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:00,610
Financier? What's that
supposed to mean, I wonder?

134
00:14:00,693 --> 00:14:02,820
I imagine he lends money.

135
00:14:02,904 --> 00:14:07,074
Exactly. And what do they say about the son?

136
00:14:07,158 --> 00:14:12,413
Academically sound. Arrogant.
Defensive to the point of pugnacity.

137
00:14:12,497 --> 00:14:15,750
As they invariably are.

138
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:19,712
Yet possessing
a keen sense of duty and loyalty.

139
00:14:22,173 --> 00:14:26,677
- Do they say he can run?
- Like the wind.

140
00:14:31,307 --> 00:14:35,937
Gentlemen, would you draw back, please?
Away from the course. Thank you.

141
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,815
Mr Abrahams, your position, please.

142
00:14:39,857 --> 00:14:43,444
Owing to the absence of a challenger,
Abrahams will run alone.

143
00:14:43,528 --> 00:14:46,280
Not so, Mr Starter.

144
00:14:50,576 --> 00:14:54,997
- Your name and college, if you please.
- Lindsay. I race beside my friend here.

145
00:14:55,081 --> 00:14:58,709
We challenge in the name
of Repton, Eton and Caius.

146
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:06,092
- I didn't know you ran.
- Nor I you. Some chap told me about this.

147
00:15:06,175 --> 00:15:08,386
I thought I'd come and push you along.

148
00:15:08,469 --> 00:15:11,222
- Delighted. Good luck.
- Splendid.

149
00:15:11,305 --> 00:15:14,934
Gentlemen, to your marks, if you please.

150
00:15:15,977 --> 00:15:19,564
Now remember, on the first strike of 12.

151
00:15:44,422 --> 00:15:47,133
Come on.

152
00:15:48,593 --> 00:15:51,179
Come on. Stay with it.

153
00:15:53,514 --> 00:15:56,642
Run harder. Come on.

154
00:15:56,726 --> 00:15:59,395
Come on.

155
00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:03,524
Seven.

156
00:16:03,608 --> 00:16:06,903
- Get those legs working.
- Eight.

157
00:16:08,404 --> 00:16:10,156
Nine.

158
00:16:14,702 --> 00:16:16,287
Go on. Go on, Harold.

159
00:16:33,554 --> 00:16:36,933
- Did they both do it?
- I think not.

160
00:16:37,016 --> 00:16:40,478
- Young Lindsay failed by a whisker.
- Pity.

161
00:16:40,561 --> 00:16:44,857
Well, it's been done.
And by a Caius man. You must be very proud.

162
00:16:44,941 --> 00:16:46,776
The first man in seven centuries.

163
00:16:47,902 --> 00:16:52,782
Perhaps they really are
God's chosen people, after all.

164
00:16:52,865 --> 00:16:56,911
I doubt if there's
a swifter man in the kingdom.

165
00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:01,082
Get to your marks.

166
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:07,672
Get set.

167
00:17:17,598 --> 00:17:20,059
Go on, run, Steve.

168
00:17:20,143 --> 00:17:22,728
Come on, Alan, faster.

169
00:17:45,209 --> 00:17:49,005
He may be your best friend, Sandy,
but he's my best brother.

170
00:17:49,088 --> 00:17:54,719
I'm thinking of him, not your blessed athletics
team. His heart's set on the mission.

171
00:17:54,802 --> 00:17:58,055
Do you not think he's got enough
on his plate without racing?

172
00:17:58,139 --> 00:18:02,018
He's fast, Jennie.
You've seen him with a ball in his hands.

173
00:18:02,101 --> 00:18:06,314
I've seen him with a Bible in his hands.
I know which is the most important.

174
00:18:06,397 --> 00:18:11,152
You can't deny him the chance. On the track,
the right technique, I'm telling you...

175
00:18:11,235 --> 00:18:13,905
Don't tell me, Sandy. I don't want to hear.

176
00:18:13,988 --> 00:18:16,115
Eric's special to me, precious.

177
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:21,996
I don't want his work spoilt
with all this running talk, do you hear?

178
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:31,923
There you are. Well done.

179
00:18:39,972 --> 00:18:42,225
You know, ladies and gentlemen,

180
00:18:42,308 --> 00:18:47,438
one of the compensations of achieving
a certain notoriety - if only as a rugby player -

181
00:18:47,522 --> 00:18:52,819
is that occasionally you're asked
to come along and give things away.

182
00:18:52,902 --> 00:18:55,738
It's often said that giving beats receiving.

183
00:18:55,822 --> 00:18:59,325
Let me tell you, the look of delight
on those little boys' faces

184
00:18:59,408 --> 00:19:05,540
was worth ten of any of the tin pots I've got
gathering dust on my Edinburgh sideboard.

185
00:19:06,582 --> 00:19:09,085
When we were in China, my father here

186
00:19:09,168 --> 00:19:13,798
was always waxing lyrical
about his wee home in the glen.

187
00:19:13,881 --> 00:19:18,886
But being oriental-born myself,
like my brothers and my sister here,

188
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:22,306
I suffered from a natural incredulity.

189
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,934
But looking about me now,

190
00:19:25,017 --> 00:19:27,270
at the heather on the hills,

191
00:19:28,229 --> 00:19:32,692
I can see he was right. It's very special.

192
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:39,490
Thank you for welcoming us home.

193
00:19:39,574 --> 00:19:44,495
And thank you for reminding me that I am,
and will be whilst I breathe...

194
00:19:46,622 --> 00:19:48,791
.. a Scot.

195
00:19:53,254 --> 00:19:55,548
Mr Provost, sir.

196
00:19:55,631 --> 00:19:58,301
Before you allow Eric here to go,

197
00:19:58,384 --> 00:20:01,804
is it not true that the main event
is still to be run?

198
00:20:01,888 --> 00:20:06,768
It is. Aye. The 200 yards open championship.

199
00:20:06,851 --> 00:20:09,979
It's the last event of this gathering,
by tradition.

200
00:20:10,062 --> 00:20:13,649
Do you not think, if we can find him some kit,

201
00:20:13,733 --> 00:20:17,236
we might persuade Scotland's finest wing
to show us his paces?

202
00:20:20,531 --> 00:20:23,576
- What do you say, Eric?
- Come on.

203
00:20:33,252 --> 00:20:36,839
To your marks. Get set.

204
00:21:47,034 --> 00:21:50,621
Didn't I tell you, Eric? Didn't I tell you?

205
00:21:54,584 --> 00:21:57,545
Surely a touch of liberality
would do no harm?

206
00:21:57,628 --> 00:22:01,424
Sandy, the kingdom of God
is not a democracy.

207
00:22:01,507 --> 00:22:03,885
The Lord never seeks re-election.

208
00:22:03,968 --> 00:22:06,637
There's no discussion, no deliberation,

209
00:22:06,721 --> 00:22:10,016
no referenda as to which road to take.

210
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:14,395
There's one right, one wrong,
one absolute ruler.

211
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:19,275
- A dictator, you mean.
- Aye, but a benign, loving dictator.

212
00:22:19,358 --> 00:22:21,652
So much for your freedom of choice.

213
00:22:21,736 --> 00:22:24,822
You've still got a choice, Sandy.

214
00:22:24,906 --> 00:22:27,992
Nobody's forcing you to follow him.

215
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:37,835
- Do you know what day it is?
- Yeah.

216
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,421
- Tell me, then.
- Sunday.

217
00:22:40,505 --> 00:22:44,383
- The Sabbath's not a day for football, is it?
- No.

218
00:22:44,467 --> 00:22:47,637
- Are you up early in the morning?
- Me ma gets me up at seven.

219
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,972
We'll have a game then, then. OK?

220
00:22:50,056 --> 00:22:52,183
Mr Liddell, is it OK if me da comes?

221
00:22:52,266 --> 00:22:54,519
Sure. Bring your whole family.

222
00:22:54,602 --> 00:22:57,438
I'll give you a five-goal start.

223
00:22:57,522 --> 00:23:00,525
- Your train's at nine.
- There's plenty of time.

224
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:03,820
Do you want the kid to grow up
thinking God's a spoilsport?

225
00:23:08,449 --> 00:23:11,744
If I may, I'd like to propose a toast.

226
00:23:11,828 --> 00:23:15,540
To the Liddell family, whom
I'm fortunate enough to call my friends.

227
00:23:15,623 --> 00:23:19,418
The Reverend JD, Mrs L, young Ernest.

228
00:23:19,502 --> 00:23:22,421
Bon voyage and safe journey back to China.

229
00:23:22,505 --> 00:23:25,049
May the years ahead be happy and content.

230
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:28,594
For those who remain, may God protect them,

231
00:23:28,678 --> 00:23:32,014
inspire them, and lead them to glory.

232
00:23:32,098 --> 00:23:34,559
Thank you, Sandy. That was very nice.

233
00:23:34,642 --> 00:23:37,395
I'm relying on you
to keep them out of mischief.

234
00:23:37,478 --> 00:23:41,732
That I will, Mrs L. If they do transgress,
I'll pop the details on a postcard.

235
00:23:41,816 --> 00:23:45,111
You can read all about it
before you can say "Marco Polo".

236
00:23:45,194 --> 00:23:47,947
- Cost you a fortune in stamps.
- Don't worry.

237
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:52,994
I intend to protect my investment.
I'm going to rule you with a rod of iron.

238
00:23:54,162 --> 00:23:58,249
Careful. We're going
to have to watch ourselves.

239
00:24:00,585 --> 00:24:02,712
You're a very lucky young man, Eric.

240
00:24:02,795 --> 00:24:07,800
You're the proud possessor of many gifts.
It's your sacred duty to put them to good use.

241
00:24:07,884 --> 00:24:11,929
Dad's right. Run like we know you can,
strong and true.

242
00:24:12,013 --> 00:24:15,099
The mission cannot but gain by your success.

243
00:24:15,183 --> 00:24:18,770
What we need now is a muscular Christian.

244
00:24:18,853 --> 00:24:22,190
To make folk sit up and notice.

245
00:24:22,273 --> 00:24:25,276
How good are you, Eric?

246
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:28,738
Sandy reckons he'll run for Scotland
before the month's out.

247
00:24:28,821 --> 00:24:31,199
Then after that, the sky's the limit.

248
00:24:31,282 --> 00:24:34,202
Meaning what?

249
00:24:34,285 --> 00:24:37,538
The Olympic Games, maybe?

250
00:24:37,622 --> 00:24:42,627
Eric, you can praise the Lord
by peeling a spud if you peel it to perfection.

251
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:46,422
Don't compromise.
Compromise is a language of the devil.

252
00:24:46,506 --> 00:24:52,053
Run in God's name
and let the world stand back in wonder.

253
00:25:55,158 --> 00:25:59,745
You came to see a race today,
to see someone win.

254
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:02,582
It happened to be me.

255
00:26:02,665 --> 00:26:06,377
But I want you to do more
than just watch a race.

256
00:26:06,461 --> 00:26:09,714
I want you to take part in it.

257
00:26:09,797 --> 00:26:13,718
I want to compare faith to running in a race.

258
00:26:14,677 --> 00:26:16,763
It's hard.

259
00:26:16,846 --> 00:26:22,059
It requires concentration of will,
energy of soul.

260
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:28,024
You experience elation
when the winner breaks the tape.

261
00:26:28,941 --> 00:26:31,986
Especially if you've got a bet on it.

262
00:26:32,069 --> 00:26:34,739
But how long does that last?

263
00:26:34,822 --> 00:26:38,451
You go home. Maybe your dinner's burnt.

264
00:26:38,534 --> 00:26:41,996
Maybe you haven't got a job.

265
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:48,461
So who am I to say believe, have faith,
in the face of life's realities?

266
00:26:49,504 --> 00:26:55,009
I would like to give you something more
permanent, but I can only point the way.

267
00:26:55,093 --> 00:26:58,137
I have no formula for winning the race.

268
00:26:58,221 --> 00:27:02,183
Everyone runs in her own way
or his own way.

269
00:27:03,226 --> 00:27:08,231
And where does the power come from
to see the race to its end?

270
00:27:08,314 --> 00:27:11,275
From within.

271
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:13,486
Jesus said:

272
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:17,740
"Behold, the kingdom of God is within you. "

273
00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:23,371
"If with all your hearts ye truly seek me,

274
00:27:23,454 --> 00:27:26,124
ye shall ever surely find me. "

275
00:27:26,207 --> 00:27:30,128
If you commit yourself to the love of Christ,

276
00:27:31,546 --> 00:27:36,426
then that is how you run a straight race.

277
00:27:42,014 --> 00:27:45,476
Cheers. Thanks for coming.
Thanks for coming.

278
00:27:57,655 --> 00:27:59,991
It's an ache.

279
00:28:01,033 --> 00:28:03,536
A helplessness.

280
00:28:04,996 --> 00:28:07,498
And an anger.

281
00:28:10,918 --> 00:28:13,963
One feels humiliated.

282
00:28:18,968 --> 00:28:23,806
Sometimes I say to myself,
"Steady on, you're imagining all this. "

283
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:26,893
Then I catch that look again.

284
00:28:26,976 --> 00:28:29,771
Catch it on the edge of a remark.

285
00:28:29,854 --> 00:28:33,608
Feel a cold reluctance in a handshake.

286
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,990
That's my father.

287
00:28:41,073 --> 00:28:43,701
A Lithuanian Jew.

288
00:28:43,785 --> 00:28:47,246
He is alien. He's as foreign as a frankfurter.

289
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,624
And a kosher one at that.

290
00:28:55,546 --> 00:28:58,216
I love and admire him.

291
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:01,219
He worships this country.

292
00:29:01,302 --> 00:29:06,891
From nothing, he built what he believed was
enough to make true Englishmen of his sons.

293
00:29:06,974 --> 00:29:09,811
My brother's a doctor.

294
00:29:13,022 --> 00:29:15,608
A leader in his field.

295
00:29:16,651 --> 00:29:21,447
- Which one is you?
- There's me with the curls. On his back.

296
00:29:25,284 --> 00:29:28,204
He wanted for nothing.

297
00:29:29,372 --> 00:29:35,628
And here am I, setting up shop
in the finest university in the land.

298
00:29:50,518 --> 00:29:53,146
But the old man forgot one thing.

299
00:29:53,229 --> 00:29:58,192
This England of his is
Christian and Anglo-Saxon.

300
00:29:58,276 --> 00:30:01,863
And so are her corridors of power.

301
00:30:01,946 --> 00:30:06,951
And those who stalk them
guard them with jealousy and venom.

302
00:30:07,034 --> 00:30:10,163
You're right to study law.
You're quite an advocate.

303
00:30:10,246 --> 00:30:15,168
A rare ethnic advantage.
It's called the gift of the gab.

304
00:30:20,631 --> 00:30:23,468
So what now? Grin and bear it?

305
00:30:23,551 --> 00:30:25,428
No, Aubrey.

306
00:30:25,511 --> 00:30:31,309
I'm going to take them on.
All of them. One by one.

307
00:30:31,392 --> 00:30:33,978
And run them off their feet.

308
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:16,145
"England beckons for sprint blue.
From our special correspondent. "

309
00:31:19,232 --> 00:31:24,654
"Clean sweep for Cambridge star.
Abrahams hat trick. "

310
00:31:24,737 --> 00:31:26,948
"From our special correspondent. "

311
00:32:27,091 --> 00:32:29,051
Bravo.

312
00:32:31,846 --> 00:32:33,848
Bravo, Harold.

313
00:33:25,274 --> 00:33:30,196
4-1 Liddell. What are you asking?

314
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:33,866
€25, Liddell to win.

315
00:33:44,627 --> 00:33:47,046
Mr Mussabini, I believe.

316
00:33:48,089 --> 00:33:50,675
My name's Colonel John Keddie. I'm...

317
00:33:50,758 --> 00:33:56,013
President of the Scottish Three As.
I know, and I'm glad to know you, sir.

318
00:33:59,058 --> 00:34:02,979
How's the leg? Nasty fall you took.

319
00:34:03,062 --> 00:34:04,689
Good luck.

320
00:34:04,772 --> 00:34:10,820
You're very welcome here, of course,
but we do have a strict amateur code.

321
00:34:10,903 --> 00:34:14,866
Colonel, don't worry your head.
I'm here spectating, that's all.

322
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:18,661
Good. I felt sure you would understand.

323
00:34:18,744 --> 00:34:22,707
Well, to battle. I hope you enjoy the games.

324
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:28,379
Games? You must be joking.
I've seen better-organised riots.

325
00:34:28,463 --> 00:34:31,549
Come on, Scotland.

326
00:34:43,186 --> 00:34:45,938
Gentlemen, get to your marks.

327
00:34:51,235 --> 00:34:53,029
Get set.

328
00:35:04,624 --> 00:35:08,169
Get up, lad. Get up.

329
00:35:10,963 --> 00:35:13,841
Come on.

330
00:35:17,929 --> 00:35:20,056
He'll never do it.

331
00:35:20,139 --> 00:35:23,810
Don't you believe it. His head's not back yet.

332
00:35:32,235 --> 00:35:34,153
Come on, Eric.

333
00:36:08,146 --> 00:36:10,898
Get back. Give him air.

334
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:15,153
Well done, Eric, son. Well done.

335
00:36:15,236 --> 00:36:18,322
He'll be right in a jiffy.
I'll away and get his clothes.

336
00:36:23,536 --> 00:36:27,248
You take good care
of this lad of yours, Mr McGrath.

337
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:31,335
Because if you drop him,
you'll never find another one like this.

338
00:36:31,419 --> 00:36:35,089
It's not the prettiest quarter
I've ever seen, Mr Liddell,

339
00:36:35,173 --> 00:36:39,969
but certainly the bravest.
Get him up. Come on, gently.

340
00:36:44,515 --> 00:36:47,226
Keep your arm around.

341
00:37:08,164 --> 00:37:10,833
Mr Mussabini.

342
00:37:11,876 --> 00:37:14,545
Mr Abrahams, is it?

343
00:37:14,629 --> 00:37:17,256
So you've travelled 300 mile just to see me?

344
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:21,844
You and Liddell.
I'd heard you were both the best.

345
00:37:21,928 --> 00:37:25,765
- And what do you think now?
- Eric Liddell?

346
00:37:25,848 --> 00:37:30,103
I've never seen such drive,
such commitment in a runner.

347
00:37:30,186 --> 00:37:34,148
He runs like a wild animal. He unnerves me.

348
00:37:34,232 --> 00:37:37,902
So he should. He frightens
the living daylights out of me.

349
00:37:37,985 --> 00:37:41,614
Yes, well, I want you to help me take him on.

350
00:37:44,117 --> 00:37:48,746
- Tell me, Mr Abrahams, are you married?
- No. Why?

351
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:54,669
Well, when the right girl comes along,
how will you feel if she pops the question?

352
00:37:58,923 --> 00:38:01,092
You see, Mr Abrahams,

353
00:38:01,175 --> 00:38:03,511
like the bridegroom,

354
00:38:03,594 --> 00:38:06,639
it's the coach that should do the asking.

355
00:38:06,722 --> 00:38:08,891
Mr Mussabini,

356
00:38:08,975 --> 00:38:11,436
I can run fast.

357
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:17,108
With your help, I think I can run even faster.
Perhaps faster than any man ever ran.

358
00:38:17,191 --> 00:38:20,194
I want that Olympic medal.

359
00:38:20,278 --> 00:38:24,615
Now, I can see it there, it's waiting for me,

360
00:38:24,699 --> 00:38:27,827
but I can't get it on my own.

361
00:38:33,249 --> 00:38:36,711
Well, we've an old saying in my game, son -

362
00:38:36,794 --> 00:38:39,839
you can't put in what God's left out.

363
00:38:39,922 --> 00:38:41,799
Now, you leave it to me.

364
00:38:41,883 --> 00:38:46,387
I'll watch you, I'll observe,
and if I think I can help -

365
00:38:46,471 --> 00:38:51,893
if I can see the big prize hanging there -
believe me, I won't waste any time.

366
00:38:51,976 --> 00:38:56,314
When we meet again,
I'll be the one that does the begging.

367
00:38:56,397 --> 00:39:02,028
- So you will watch me?
- Son, if you're good enough,

368
00:39:02,111 --> 00:39:05,615
I'll take you apart piece by bloody piece.

369
00:39:05,698 --> 00:39:07,742
Thank you.

370
00:40:10,596 --> 00:40:14,350
- Didn't I tell you? Isn't she a peach?
- She's magnificent.

371
00:40:21,774 --> 00:40:23,693
Bravo. Bravo.

372
00:40:38,332 --> 00:40:42,795
- I think it went rather well.
- I must say I'm enjoying it.

373
00:40:42,879 --> 00:40:46,466
- What about you, JB?
- I've done better productions myself.

374
00:40:46,549 --> 00:40:50,803
- I don't remember seeing any.
- So the stone heart's frail.

375
00:40:50,887 --> 00:40:53,931
- Abrahams is smitten?
- Smitten? He's decapitated.

376
00:40:54,015 --> 00:40:56,726
- He won't listen to reason.
- The lad's in love.

377
00:40:56,809 --> 00:40:59,771
He's just set eyes on her.
I've worshipped her for years.

378
00:40:59,854 --> 00:41:03,900
- By the way, where is he now?
- He's gone to ask her out to dinner.

379
00:41:03,983 --> 00:41:07,153
- Has he, by Jove?
- In the interval?

380
00:41:07,236 --> 00:41:10,448
- Thank you. Mine, I take it?
- Ah, Harold.

381
00:41:11,365 --> 00:41:13,785
Lovely.

382
00:41:16,662 --> 00:41:17,872
- Well?
- Well what?

383
00:41:17,955 --> 00:41:20,666
- Did you speak to her?
- Yes.

384
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:23,169
- Is she coming?
- Yes.

385
00:41:23,252 --> 00:41:24,962
- To dinner?
- Yes.

386
00:41:25,046 --> 00:41:28,257
Her kid brother, athletics-mad,
never stops talking about me.

387
00:41:28,341 --> 00:41:32,845
Monty, you'd better have my glass.
I've a feeling you're going to need it.

388
00:41:33,554 --> 00:41:35,932
Sorry, Monty.

389
00:41:41,896 --> 00:41:44,232
Yes, thank you very much, sir.

390
00:41:44,315 --> 00:41:46,609
Yes, of course I will, sir.

391
00:41:51,405 --> 00:41:53,491
Good evening, Miss Gordon.

392
00:41:53,574 --> 00:41:55,910
A triumph, I hear.

393
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:06,170
Very naughty. You should have come in.

394
00:42:20,852 --> 00:42:23,312
Who was that chap over there?

395
00:42:23,396 --> 00:42:27,066
Music critic of the Star.
Boring old buffer, really.

396
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:30,862
- He obviously enjoyed it.
- I shouldn't think so.

397
00:42:30,945 --> 00:42:35,616
They always say that. They save the poison
for the print. A bit off tonight, I thought.

398
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:40,663
- What? You were magnificent.
- Thank you.

399
00:42:40,746 --> 00:42:45,460
One of our little maids has gone
and got herself preggers with a gondolier.

400
00:42:45,543 --> 00:42:48,546
We had to shove her second on tonight.
The trio...

401
00:42:48,629 --> 00:42:52,341
- Your usual, Miss Gordon?
- Thank you, Toffy.

402
00:42:52,425 --> 00:42:56,387
- And you, sir.
- Thank you.

403
00:42:56,471 --> 00:43:03,394
This is Mr Abrahams, a very famous runner.
He's trying your special for the first time.

404
00:43:03,478 --> 00:43:07,190
- I hope you enjoy it, sir.
- I'm sure I shall.

405
00:43:08,232 --> 00:43:10,943
Well, go on, then.

406
00:43:12,737 --> 00:43:17,658
It's a secret concoction of Toffy's,
a sort of cocktail de maison.

407
00:43:17,742 --> 00:43:20,995
So you'd jolly well better enjoy it.

408
00:43:21,078 --> 00:43:23,289
- Excellent.
- There, Toffy.

409
00:43:23,372 --> 00:43:26,751
You've won yourself a friend for life.

410
00:43:26,834 --> 00:43:29,128
My favourite, please.

411
00:43:31,005 --> 00:43:33,716
- For two.
- My pleasure.

412
00:43:36,094 --> 00:43:38,304
What have I ordered?

413
00:43:38,387 --> 00:43:40,848
Surprise. Cheerio.

414
00:43:40,932 --> 00:43:43,017
Cheerio.

415
00:43:49,107 --> 00:43:55,154
Well, the great Harold Abrahams.
My brother will be insanely jealous.

416
00:43:55,238 --> 00:43:57,782
So will mine.

417
00:44:01,452 --> 00:44:05,164
- You don't look very ruthless.
- Should I?

418
00:44:05,248 --> 00:44:09,669
According to my brother.
Tim says that's why you always win.

419
00:44:09,752 --> 00:44:12,255
- Why running?
- Why singing?

420
00:44:12,338 --> 00:44:14,424
It's my job.

421
00:44:16,884 --> 00:44:20,847
No, that's silly. I do it because I love it.

422
00:44:22,557 --> 00:44:26,018
- Do you love running?
- I'm more of an addict.

423
00:44:26,102 --> 00:44:28,187
It's a compulsion. A weapon.

424
00:44:28,271 --> 00:44:32,233
- Against what?
- Being Jewish, I suppose.

425
00:44:36,988 --> 00:44:39,157
You're not serious?

426
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,452
You're not Jewish, or you wouldn't ask.

427
00:44:42,535 --> 00:44:45,997
Fiddlesticks. People don't care.

428
00:44:48,124 --> 00:44:52,920
Anyway, being Jewish
hasn't done you any harm.

429
00:44:53,004 --> 00:44:55,673
I'm what I call "semideprived".

430
00:44:55,757 --> 00:44:57,967
That sounds clever. What does it mean?

431
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:03,097
It means they lead me to water,
but they won't let me drink.

432
00:45:03,181 --> 00:45:07,268
You're a funny old stick, Mr Harold Abrahams.

433
00:45:08,269 --> 00:45:12,148
Funny, but fascinating.

434
00:45:12,231 --> 00:45:14,734
I'll settle for the fascinating.

435
00:45:14,817 --> 00:45:18,154
Life isn't that gloomy, is it?

436
00:45:19,655 --> 00:45:22,158
Not tonight.

437
00:45:25,244 --> 00:45:27,580
You're so beautiful.

438
00:45:29,624 --> 00:45:31,417
Like you.

439
00:45:36,798 --> 00:45:38,966
Pigs' trotters, sir.

440
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:41,594
My God.

441
00:45:52,355 --> 00:45:58,194
The train arriving at platform two is the
overnight Flying Scotsman from Aberdeen.

442
00:45:58,277 --> 00:46:02,782
7:30, Mr Liddell. 7:30 on the dot.

443
00:46:02,865 --> 00:46:06,786
- There you are, sir. Hot tea and toast.
- Great.

444
00:46:06,869 --> 00:46:09,372
- You sleep all right?
- Like a log.

445
00:46:09,455 --> 00:46:12,166
You must have a clear conscience.

446
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:17,088
- Far from it. Are we here?
- Aye, sir. Just pulled in. King's Cross.

447
00:46:17,171 --> 00:46:22,677
And here's the paper, with your picture in.
Expecting great things, from all accounts.

448
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,929
Are they indeed?

449
00:46:25,888 --> 00:46:28,724
- Here you are.
- Much obliged, sir.

450
00:46:28,808 --> 00:46:33,479
No hurry. You've got an hour before
we kick you out. Good luck for this afternoon.

451
00:46:33,563 --> 00:46:35,356
- Thank you.
- Come on, sir.

452
00:46:38,276 --> 00:46:42,405
Aye, Mr Abrahams. So's the Scot.

453
00:47:39,796 --> 00:47:42,799
Mr Abrahams?

454
00:47:42,882 --> 00:47:45,259
Mr Liddell.

455
00:47:46,302 --> 00:47:50,264
- I'd like to wish you the best of success.
- Thank you.

456
00:47:50,348 --> 00:47:53,267
And may the best man win.

457
00:48:00,149 --> 00:48:02,735
Get to your marks.

458
00:48:14,038 --> 00:48:16,791
Get set.

459
00:48:29,178 --> 00:48:31,764
Extraordinary.

460
00:49:22,356 --> 00:49:25,234
Harold.

461
00:49:30,156 --> 00:49:36,621
This is absolutely ridiculous. It's a race
you've lost, not a relative. Nobody's dead.

462
00:49:36,704 --> 00:49:41,084
For goodness' sake, snap out of it, Harold.
You're behaving like a child.

463
00:49:41,167 --> 00:49:43,586
- I lost.
- I know.

464
00:49:43,669 --> 00:49:47,381
I was there, remember? Watching.

465
00:49:49,008 --> 00:49:51,552
It was marvellous.

466
00:49:51,636 --> 00:49:54,097
You were marvellous.

467
00:49:55,139 --> 00:49:59,227
He was more marvellous, that's all.
On the day, the best man won.

468
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:01,646
I had to look for him.

469
00:50:01,729 --> 00:50:05,316
It's absolutely fundamental. You never look.

470
00:50:06,192 --> 00:50:10,196
He was ahead. There was nothing you
could've done. He won fair and square.

471
00:50:10,279 --> 00:50:12,698
Well, that's that, Abrahams.

472
00:50:12,782 --> 00:50:18,830
- If you can't take a beating, it's for the best.
- I don't run to take beatings.

473
00:50:18,913 --> 00:50:24,168
I run to win. If I can't win, I won't run.

474
00:50:24,252 --> 00:50:29,590
If you don't run, you can't win. Give me
a ring when you've sorted that one out.

475
00:50:29,674 --> 00:50:31,968
Sybil...

476
00:50:33,219 --> 00:50:35,721
Don't go.

477
00:50:37,807 --> 00:50:42,770
- I just don't know what to do.
- Try growing up.

478
00:51:02,957 --> 00:51:04,834
Harold.

479
00:51:05,918 --> 00:51:10,465
You're a great man. You ran like a god.

480
00:51:11,883 --> 00:51:15,011
I was proud of you. Don't make me ashamed.

481
00:51:15,094 --> 00:51:18,181
It's not the losing, Syb.

482
00:51:18,264 --> 00:51:21,058
Eric Liddell's a fine man and a fine runner.

483
00:51:21,142 --> 00:51:23,603
It's me.

484
00:51:23,686 --> 00:51:26,230
After all that work,

485
00:51:26,314 --> 00:51:29,442
now, God knows, what do I aim for?

486
00:51:30,485 --> 00:51:34,238
Beating him the next time.

487
00:51:34,322 --> 00:51:37,742
Sybil, I can't run any faster.

488
00:51:39,869 --> 00:51:42,497
Mr Abrahams.

489
00:51:46,834 --> 00:51:50,004
I can find you another two yards.

490
00:52:00,306 --> 00:52:03,392
Charlie Paddock. Californian Cannonball.

491
00:52:03,476 --> 00:52:09,107
World's fastest human. Winner, 100 metres,
Olympic Games, 1920, Antwerp. Time?

492
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:11,400
Ten point three.

493
00:52:14,445 --> 00:52:19,242
Jackson Scholz, the New York Thunderbolt.

494
00:52:19,325 --> 00:52:23,871
Runner-up, Olympic Games, 1920.
Lost by looking right.

495
00:52:23,955 --> 00:52:28,584
Look, here's the finish. You see?
Paddock, leaping past him at the tape?

496
00:52:28,668 --> 00:52:31,421
That glance cost Scholz the race.

497
00:52:31,504 --> 00:52:35,633
- Scholz's fastest?
- Ten point three... Four.

498
00:52:38,553 --> 00:52:42,265
Eric Liddell. Well, you know all about him.

499
00:52:42,348 --> 00:52:46,727
Look at them. Think them. Breathe them.

500
00:52:47,895 --> 00:52:51,357
I want their faces leering at you
every time you shut your eyes.

501
00:52:51,441 --> 00:52:54,193
The Flying Scotsman first. That bloody hurt.

502
00:52:54,277 --> 00:52:58,573
What, Eric Liddell? Well, he's no real problem.

503
00:52:58,656 --> 00:53:03,995
He's a great runner, but he needs to go
further out. He's no 100 metres man.

504
00:53:04,078 --> 00:53:06,873
- Could've fooled me.
- Yeah, he's fast.

505
00:53:06,956 --> 00:53:11,294
But he won't go any faster,
not in the dash, anyway. He's a gut runner.

506
00:53:11,377 --> 00:53:16,758
He's all heart. Digs deep.
A short sprint is run on nerves.

507
00:53:16,841 --> 00:53:19,802
- It's tailor-made for neurotics.
- Thanks.

508
00:53:19,886 --> 00:53:23,222
You can push guts, bully them,
but you can hone nerves.

509
00:53:23,306 --> 00:53:26,809
Paddock, Scholz and Eric Liddell.

510
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:30,938
Come here a minute, Mr Abrahams.

511
00:53:35,777 --> 00:53:38,613
Now, do you know
why you lost the other day?

512
00:53:38,696 --> 00:53:41,115
Because you're overstriding.

513
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:43,409
Just a couple of inches. Now...

514
00:53:43,493 --> 00:53:49,540
These coins represent the strides
in your hundred metres.

515
00:53:50,374 --> 00:53:54,712
Have you got another two coins,
Mr Abrahams?

516
00:53:55,588 --> 00:53:58,674
Well, maybe we can find them.

517
00:53:58,758 --> 00:54:02,762
As I said, overstriding.

518
00:54:02,845 --> 00:54:07,183
Death to the sprinter.
Slap in the face each stride you take.

519
00:54:07,266 --> 00:54:09,560
Knocks you back.

520
00:54:09,644 --> 00:54:11,437
Like that.

521
00:54:11,646 --> 00:54:12,814
Like that.

522
00:54:12,897 --> 00:54:14,982
And that.

523
00:54:16,275 --> 00:54:17,360
Now...

524
00:54:29,163 --> 00:54:32,083
I want you to imagine
you're running on hot bricks.

525
00:54:32,166 --> 00:54:35,336
If you leave your feet on the ground,
they'll get burnt.

526
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:38,840
Up, up, up. Light, light, light.
Light as a feather.

527
00:55:03,072 --> 00:55:04,615
Set.

528
00:55:31,768 --> 00:55:36,355
No. Not your head back again.
Get it level. Go and do it again.

529
00:55:36,439 --> 00:55:37,607
That's it.

530
00:55:45,948 --> 00:55:47,325
Faster.

531
00:55:47,408 --> 00:55:49,786
Pass the car. Go on.

532
00:55:49,869 --> 00:55:53,039
Go on. Go on.
Go on, go on. On, on.

533
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:57,710
Come on, now. Keep it up, come on.

534
00:55:58,669 --> 00:56:01,214
Rhythm, Mr Abrahams, rhythm.

535
00:56:26,572 --> 00:56:30,451
Training, training. All I ever hear is training.

536
00:56:30,535 --> 00:56:33,121
Do you believe in
what we're doing here or not?

537
00:56:33,204 --> 00:56:35,790
Look, Jennie, I'm sorry.

538
00:56:36,916 --> 00:56:39,043
I was late. I apologise.

539
00:56:39,127 --> 00:56:42,171
- That's all very well, Eric.
- Look, I said I was sorry.

540
00:56:42,255 --> 00:56:45,133
To me. It's not me you've insulted.

541
00:56:45,216 --> 00:56:47,427
Away with your bother.

542
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:50,221
The Lord won't feel slighted
at the missing of a bus.

543
00:56:50,304 --> 00:56:55,351
Yes, Eric, you missed a bus. But why?
Your mind's not with us any more, son.

544
00:56:55,435 --> 00:57:00,773
It's full of running and starting and medals.
It's so full, you've no room for standing still.

545
00:57:00,857 --> 00:57:03,526
Jennie, Jennie, Jennie.

546
00:57:03,609 --> 00:57:06,112
Don't fret yourself.

547
00:57:06,195 --> 00:57:08,948
I do fret myself, Eric.

548
00:57:09,031 --> 00:57:11,367
I'm frightened for you.

549
00:57:11,451 --> 00:57:15,413
I'm frightened for what it all might do to you.

550
00:57:26,215 --> 00:57:29,677
Please, Mr Liddell.
Would you sign your name, please?

551
00:57:29,761 --> 00:57:31,637
Surely.

552
00:57:33,514 --> 00:57:36,225
You want to pick yourself a pen?

553
00:57:43,524 --> 00:57:45,818
- There you are.
- Thanks.

554
00:57:59,248 --> 00:58:04,629
Come on, Jennie, let's go for a walk.
I've got something to say.

555
00:58:16,974 --> 00:58:20,394
It's a sight and a half, isn't it, Jennie?

556
00:58:30,696 --> 00:58:33,825
Auld Reekie. I'll be sad to leave it.

557
00:58:47,088 --> 00:58:52,635
I've decided. I'm going back to China.
The missionary service have accepted me.

558
00:58:52,718 --> 00:58:54,804
Eric.

559
00:58:54,887 --> 00:58:57,640
I'm so pleased.

560
00:58:57,723 --> 00:59:01,477
But I've got a lot of running to do first.

561
00:59:01,561 --> 00:59:03,771
Jennie.

562
00:59:03,855 --> 00:59:06,858
Jennie, you've got to understand.

563
00:59:09,026 --> 00:59:12,405
I believe that God made me for a purpose.

564
00:59:12,488 --> 00:59:14,866
For China.

565
00:59:14,949 --> 00:59:18,119
But he also made me fast.

566
00:59:18,202 --> 00:59:21,664
And when I run, I feel his pleasure.

567
00:59:22,957 --> 00:59:26,794
To give it up would be
to hold him in contempt.

568
00:59:26,878 --> 00:59:29,297
You were right.

569
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:32,300
It's not just fun.

570
00:59:32,383 --> 00:59:35,511
To win is to honour him.

571
00:59:37,638 --> 00:59:39,724
Jennie.

572
00:59:40,683 --> 00:59:42,852
Jennie.

573
00:59:42,935 --> 00:59:45,938
I've got my degree to get.

574
00:59:46,022 --> 00:59:48,858
All that work.

575
00:59:48,941 --> 00:59:51,819
Then there's Paris.

576
00:59:51,903 --> 00:59:54,405
The Olympic Games.

577
00:59:56,699 --> 00:59:59,285
There's just not enough of me.

578
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:05,625
I'm asking you to manage the mission
on your own till then.

579
01:00:06,542 --> 01:00:09,253
Will you do that for me, Jennie?

580
01:00:26,395 --> 01:00:32,443
- Andy, I've lost him. Can't reach him.
- You will, old girl.

581
01:00:32,527 --> 01:00:37,698
He says he needs to clear his mind of me.

582
01:00:37,782 --> 01:00:40,493
He can't love me and say that.

583
01:00:48,709 --> 01:00:51,212
The world's against him, or so he believes.

584
01:00:51,295 --> 01:00:53,840
Now he's got a chance to prove himself.

585
01:00:53,923 --> 01:00:58,010
He can't see or hear anything
beyond that, not even you.

586
01:00:58,094 --> 01:01:00,847
It's hard, but you've got to try
and understand.

587
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:05,518
- Why should I?
- Because he's what you want, isn't he?

588
01:01:06,853 --> 01:01:10,481
What about you? And Stallard and Aubrey?

589
01:01:10,565 --> 01:01:12,733
The chance is there for you too.

590
01:01:12,817 --> 01:01:15,903
To be a fastest, yes, but not the fastest.

591
01:01:15,987 --> 01:01:18,489
The fastest man ever before.

592
01:01:20,575 --> 01:01:23,286
Father's never going to learn how to do that.

593
01:01:23,369 --> 01:01:25,455
That's immortality.

594
01:01:25,538 --> 01:01:28,708
Just think what it means to a man like Harold.

595
01:01:28,791 --> 01:01:31,961
Well, to me the whole thing's fun.
I don't need that.

596
01:01:32,044 --> 01:01:35,173
"Cast care aside" and all that.

597
01:01:35,256 --> 01:01:39,719
But for Harold, it's a matter of life and death.

598
01:01:39,802 --> 01:01:42,221
- So all I can do is wait?
- 'Fraid so.

599
01:01:42,305 --> 01:01:45,683
And pray like hell that he wins, what?

600
01:01:45,767 --> 01:01:48,060
And if he doesn't?

601
01:01:50,146 --> 01:01:52,398
You mustn't worry, old thing.

602
01:01:52,482 --> 01:01:56,068
I've never ever seen a man
so smitten as our Harold.

603
01:01:56,152 --> 01:01:59,614
It's just that I'm a little envious, that's all.

604
01:01:59,697 --> 01:02:01,783
Andy.

605
01:02:05,286 --> 01:02:08,831
- Your parasol, Miss Gordon.
- Thank you, Mildred.

606
01:02:09,499 --> 01:02:11,375
Good luck tonight.

607
01:02:11,459 --> 01:02:13,628
He's a damned fool.

608
01:02:13,711 --> 01:02:17,215
I always thought the Irish had all the luck.

609
01:02:17,298 --> 01:02:19,592
- John, Savoy Theatre.
- Yes, sir.

610
01:02:19,675 --> 01:02:21,761
Splendid.

611
01:02:31,104 --> 01:02:34,023
Mildred, would you get my spikes?

612
01:02:37,944 --> 01:02:40,446
Ready, my lord.

613
01:02:41,531 --> 01:02:44,659
Now, Coote, if I shed a drop I want to know.

614
01:02:44,742 --> 01:02:47,453
Touch but not spill, what?

615
01:03:01,134 --> 01:03:05,555
Life slips by, Abrahams. Life slips by.

616
01:03:05,638 --> 01:03:09,976
But this fine old university of ours,
she offers some rare consolations.

617
01:03:10,059 --> 01:03:12,311
Beyond measure, sir.

618
01:03:12,395 --> 01:03:14,939
I take it that you would be acutely grieved

619
01:03:15,022 --> 01:03:19,694
to discover that any behaviour or action
on your part were causing her grief?

620
01:03:19,777 --> 01:03:22,780
Naturally, sir. I would, deeply.

621
01:03:22,864 --> 01:03:25,825
Good. I was sure of it.

622
01:03:25,908 --> 01:03:30,455
Here in Cambridge, we've always
been proud of our athletic prowess.

623
01:03:30,538 --> 01:03:33,750
We've always believed
that our games are indispensable

624
01:03:33,833 --> 01:03:37,795
in helping to complete
the education of an Englishman.

625
01:03:37,879 --> 01:03:40,381
They create character.

626
01:03:40,465 --> 01:03:44,010
They foster courage, honesty and leadership.

627
01:03:44,093 --> 01:03:47,096
But most of all,
an unassailable spirit of loyalty,

628
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:51,058
comradeship and mutual responsibility.

629
01:03:51,142 --> 01:03:55,062
- Would you agree?
- Yes, sir. I would.

630
01:03:59,776 --> 01:04:03,529
There is a growing suspicion
in the bosom of this university -

631
01:04:03,613 --> 01:04:10,119
and I tell you this without decrying your
achievements, in which we all rejoice -

632
01:04:10,203 --> 01:04:12,914
that in your enthusiasm for success

633
01:04:12,997 --> 01:04:15,917
you have perhaps lost sight
of some of these ideals.

634
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,922
May I ask what form
this disloyalty, this betrayal, takes?

635
01:04:21,005 --> 01:04:24,801
- Hardly betrayal.
- The word "grief" was mentioned.

636
01:04:24,884 --> 01:04:28,262
It's said that you use a personal coach.

637
01:04:29,222 --> 01:04:31,474
Mr Mussabini, yes.

638
01:04:31,557 --> 01:04:35,061
- Is he an Italian?
- Of Italian extraction, yes.

639
01:04:35,144 --> 01:04:38,314
- I see.
- But not all Italian.

640
01:04:38,397 --> 01:04:42,401
- I'm relieved to hear it.
- He's half-Arab.

641
01:04:45,154 --> 01:04:50,660
Do we take it that you employ this
Mr Mussabini on a professional basis?

642
01:04:50,743 --> 01:04:54,789
Sam Mussabini is the finest, most advanced,

643
01:04:54,872 --> 01:04:58,209
clearest-thinking athletics coach
in the country.

644
01:04:58,292 --> 01:05:01,045
I'm honoured to be worthy of his attention.

645
01:05:01,129 --> 01:05:04,882
- He's a professional.
- What else would he be? He's the best.

646
01:05:04,966 --> 01:05:09,512
But there, Mr Abrahams,
I'm afraid our paths diverge.

647
01:05:09,595 --> 01:05:13,724
You see, this university believes
that the way of the amateur

648
01:05:13,808 --> 01:05:17,019
is the only one to provide satisfactory results.

649
01:05:17,103 --> 01:05:19,147
I am an amateur.

650
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:24,026
You're being trained by a professional.
You've adopted a professional attitude.

651
01:05:24,110 --> 01:05:28,698
For the past year, you have concentrated
on developing your own technique

652
01:05:28,781 --> 01:05:33,786
in the headlong pursuit,
may I suggest, of individual glory.

653
01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:37,874
Not a policy very conducive to
the fostering of esprit de corps.

654
01:05:37,957 --> 01:05:41,836
I am a Cambridge man first and last.

655
01:05:41,919 --> 01:05:45,298
I am an Englishman first and last.

656
01:05:45,381 --> 01:05:49,719
What I have achieved,
what I intend to achieve, is for my family,

657
01:05:49,802 --> 01:05:53,556
my university and my country.

658
01:05:53,639 --> 01:05:57,059
And I bitterly resent
your suggesting otherwise.

659
01:05:57,143 --> 01:06:00,396
Your aim is to win at all costs, is it not?

660
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:04,400
At all costs, no.
But I do aim to win within the rules.

661
01:06:04,901 --> 01:06:07,779
You would rather
I played the gentleman and lost?

662
01:06:07,862 --> 01:06:10,573
To playing the tradesman, yes.

663
01:06:13,868 --> 01:06:19,457
My dear boy, your approach has been,
if I may say so, a little too plebeian.

664
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:24,587
You are the elite, and are therefore
expected to behave as such.

665
01:06:33,679 --> 01:06:38,309
Thank you, sir, for your hospitality.

666
01:06:39,811 --> 01:06:43,773
The evening has been most illuminating.

667
01:06:43,856 --> 01:06:46,150
Good night to you, sir.

668
01:06:48,027 --> 01:06:50,530
You know, gentlemen,

669
01:06:51,614 --> 01:06:54,534
you yearn for victory, just as I do,

670
01:06:54,617 --> 01:06:58,746
but achieved with
the apparent effortlessness of gods.

671
01:06:58,830 --> 01:07:03,876
Yours are the archaic values
of the prep-school playground.

672
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:07,046
You deceive no one but yourselves.

673
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:13,511
I believe in the pursuit of excellence,
and I'll carry the future with me.

674
01:07:23,896 --> 01:07:27,525
Well, there goes your Semite, Hugh.

675
01:07:27,608 --> 01:07:30,194
A different god.

676
01:07:30,278 --> 01:07:32,572
A different mountaintop.

677
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:48,171
Harold. Harold. We're in.

678
01:07:48,254 --> 01:07:52,508
All of us. You, Henry,
Andy and me, we're all in.

679
01:07:52,592 --> 01:07:58,181
You 100 and 200, Andy 400 and hurdles,
Henry the mile, and me the steeplechase.

680
01:07:58,264 --> 01:08:00,767
Paris, here we come.

681
01:08:02,143 --> 01:08:05,271
Eric Liddell's picked too.
Rivals under the same flag.

682
01:08:05,354 --> 01:08:07,565
Your chance to get even, eh?

683
01:08:07,648 --> 01:08:09,859
I can't wait.

684
01:08:09,942 --> 01:08:13,654
Welcome to Dover, my Lord Birkenhead.

685
01:08:13,738 --> 01:08:18,576
Lord, are the Yanks so well-trained
that they'll wipe the floor with our boys?

686
01:08:18,659 --> 01:08:21,913
It's true that the Americans
have prepared seriously,

687
01:08:21,996 --> 01:08:24,707
some would say too seriously,
to gain success.

688
01:08:24,791 --> 01:08:29,462
But we feel we may, in our
unsophisticated way, have their match.

689
01:08:29,545 --> 01:08:32,965
Do the British stand a chance
against such American athletes

690
01:08:33,049 --> 01:08:35,843
as Charlie Paddock and Jackson Scholz?

691
01:08:35,927 --> 01:08:40,973
You Americans have a number of men
who are rated as world-beaters,

692
01:08:41,057 --> 01:08:45,686
but this contest is in Europe,
not in the rarefied climes of the United States.

693
01:08:45,770 --> 01:08:49,857
Parisian conditions are bound to be
more robust, more combative,

694
01:08:49,941 --> 01:08:53,319
- and certainly more cavalier.
- More cavalier?

695
01:08:53,402 --> 01:08:58,199
Are the Yanks so well-trained
that they will wipe the floor with our boys?

696
01:08:58,282 --> 01:09:00,701
In Abrahams, Liddell and Lindsay,

697
01:09:00,785 --> 01:09:05,581
we have the men who could
give them a run for their money.

698
01:09:08,918 --> 01:09:10,962
Eric.

699
01:09:11,045 --> 01:09:14,966
Sandy. You haven't come all the way
from Scotland just to see me off?

700
01:09:15,049 --> 01:09:19,554
I'm seeing myself off. Come on
up the gangplank, we'll miss the boat.

701
01:09:19,637 --> 01:09:23,182
Mr Liddell. What do you think
of your chances against Abrahams?

702
01:09:23,266 --> 01:09:27,562
- I'll do my best. Can do no less. Right?
- Mr Liddell.

703
01:09:27,645 --> 01:09:31,274
What about the qualifying heats on Sunday?

704
01:09:31,357 --> 01:09:36,612
- What did you say?
- On Sunday. Can you beat the Americans?

705
01:09:36,696 --> 01:09:39,198
There's Mr Abrahams. There he is.

706
01:09:39,282 --> 01:09:41,617
- Mr Abrahams.
- Sorry, I've no time...

707
01:09:41,701 --> 01:09:44,871
- Hello, Jeremy.
- Gilbert and Sullivan will win.

708
01:09:44,954 --> 01:09:47,457
- Harold.
- Sybil.

709
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:56,883
- I came to wish you luck.
- I'm glad.

710
01:10:01,137 --> 01:10:05,224
I understand. I wanted you to know that.

711
01:10:06,851 --> 01:10:09,645
I'll be here when you come back.

712
01:10:15,318 --> 01:10:19,614
Hurry along there, Mr Abrahams.
She's about to sail.

713
01:10:19,697 --> 01:10:23,618
I must go. I'll see you in three weeks.

714
01:10:26,329 --> 01:10:28,414
Bye-bye.

715
01:10:31,834 --> 01:10:36,089
Mind your step, sir.
We want you to get there in one piece.

716
01:11:18,172 --> 01:11:22,593
- When did you get to know?
- Did you not read the papers this morning?

717
01:11:22,677 --> 01:11:29,475
The heats for the hundred are on the Sunday,
the semis and final a couple of days after.

718
01:11:29,559 --> 01:11:31,727
It's only a heat.

719
01:11:32,812 --> 01:11:35,731
Does it make all that difference?

720
01:11:39,485 --> 01:11:41,571
Yeah.

721
01:11:41,654 --> 01:11:43,948
Yeah, it does.

722
01:11:48,578 --> 01:11:52,540
And strong though the temptation may be

723
01:11:52,623 --> 01:11:57,378
to disport your newly acquired finery
around the streets of Paris -

724
01:11:57,462 --> 01:12:00,173
if they aren't temptation enough -

725
01:12:00,256 --> 01:12:02,800
may I ask you on behalf
of the Olympic Committee

726
01:12:02,884 --> 01:12:08,055
to save your sartorial splendour
until at least after the opening ceremony?

727
01:12:08,139 --> 01:12:12,977
May I remind you, you are the favoured few.

728
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:16,189
You constitute what is without doubt

729
01:12:16,272 --> 01:12:20,359
the most powerful athletic force
ever to leave these shores.

730
01:12:20,443 --> 01:12:22,779
You are to face the world's best -

731
01:12:22,862 --> 01:12:27,575
brown and yellow, white and black,
young and ardent as yourselves,

732
01:12:27,658 --> 01:12:30,369
fleet of foot and strong of limb,

733
01:12:30,453 --> 01:12:35,833
from every civilised nation
on the face of the earth.

734
01:12:35,917 --> 01:12:39,837
I have no doubt that you
will acquit yourselves honourably

735
01:12:39,921 --> 01:12:43,466
and with distinction.

736
01:12:45,218 --> 01:12:48,346
Good luck to you all.

737
01:13:05,196 --> 01:13:09,659
Your mind's not with us any more.
It's full of sprinting and starting and medals.

738
01:13:09,742 --> 01:13:15,706
- It's so full, you've no room for standing still.
- Jennie, Jennie. Don't fret yourself.

739
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:19,460
I do fret myself, Eric. I'm frightened for you.

740
01:13:19,544 --> 01:13:24,340
I'm frightened what it all might do to you.

741
01:13:25,299 --> 01:13:28,094
- Do you know what day it is?
- Sunday.

742
01:13:28,177 --> 01:13:31,973
The Sabbath's not a day for football, is it?

743
01:13:35,852 --> 01:13:40,815
It's an awful step you're taking, Liddell.
The whole of Britain will be watching you.

744
01:13:40,898 --> 01:13:44,235
I don't know that they'll understand.

745
01:13:45,987 --> 01:13:48,823
I'm not sure that I understand.

746
01:13:50,783 --> 01:13:53,578
I'm not sure that I do either, sir.

747
01:13:53,661 --> 01:14:00,042
For the last three years I've devoted myself
to my running, just to be on this ship.

748
01:14:00,126 --> 01:14:03,546
I gave up my rugby. My work has suffered.

749
01:14:04,547 --> 01:14:08,885
And I've deeply hurt
someone I hold very dear.

750
01:14:08,968 --> 01:14:14,682
Because I told myself if I win, I win for God.

751
01:14:14,766 --> 01:14:19,687
And now I find myself sitting here,
destroying it all.

752
01:14:20,688 --> 01:14:25,651
But I have to.
To run would be against God's law.

753
01:14:27,153 --> 01:14:29,447
I was mistaken.

754
01:14:31,908 --> 01:14:36,245
My boy, as things stand, you must not run.

755
01:14:36,329 --> 01:14:39,582
But I want you to hold your fire
for a while, Liddell.

756
01:14:39,665 --> 01:14:43,294
Leave everything to me.

757
01:14:43,377 --> 01:14:47,006
Say nothing. Wait until we get to Paris.

758
01:14:47,090 --> 01:14:49,300
I'll have a word with the French.

759
01:14:49,383 --> 01:14:51,552
I'm not without a certain pull.

760
01:14:51,636 --> 01:14:55,765
And we fought in the war together,
they do owe us something.

761
01:14:55,848 --> 01:14:58,101
I don't understand.

762
01:14:58,184 --> 01:15:01,687
They're not a very principled lot, the Frogs.

763
01:15:01,771 --> 01:15:06,609
But, when faced with a stand like yours,
one never knows.

764
01:15:06,692 --> 01:15:09,195
I might get through.

765
01:15:12,573 --> 01:15:15,034
I just might possibly persuade them.

766
01:15:17,078 --> 01:15:21,332
The French, sir? What can they do?

767
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:24,419
Shift that bloody heat of yours, of course.

768
01:15:24,502 --> 01:15:26,796
Good evening.

769
01:15:32,885 --> 01:15:35,179
Goodbye, sir.

770
01:16:19,932 --> 01:16:24,061
I wish you could see, Ma,
the wonderful spirit now we've left England.

771
01:16:24,145 --> 01:16:27,190
Harold on the piano,
his beloved Gilbert and Sullivan.

772
01:16:27,273 --> 01:16:31,986
We're all laughing and relaxing,
and chatting about anything but running.

773
01:16:32,070 --> 01:16:34,697
We're here for Britain and we know it.

774
01:16:34,781 --> 01:16:39,619
I'm here for you, Ma.
You and Pa. I hope I do you proud.

775
01:16:39,702 --> 01:16:45,458
There's not a chap here who isn't ready
to burst his heart for all we've left behind.

776
01:17:46,102 --> 01:17:51,107
"American champions arrive in France. "

777
01:18:00,241 --> 01:18:02,160
There's Paddock.

778
01:18:02,243 --> 01:18:05,747
Charles Paddock.

779
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:09,709
- There's Fitch.
- My God.

780
01:18:09,792 --> 01:18:13,796
- And there's Scholz.
- Yes, that's Scholz all right.

781
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:16,674
A bit more my size. Mean with it, though.

782
01:18:16,758 --> 01:18:18,217
Ten point four.

783
01:18:18,301 --> 01:18:21,554
Got your plate full there, Harold.

784
01:18:21,637 --> 01:18:24,056
Battle on your hands, what?

785
01:18:30,646 --> 01:18:34,901
Charles H Paddock and Jackson Scholz,

786
01:18:34,984 --> 01:18:37,528
the fastest men in the world.

787
01:18:48,998 --> 01:18:51,667
Push it. Push it.

788
01:18:51,751 --> 01:18:55,171
Come on, I said push it. Push it.

789
01:18:59,175 --> 01:19:03,137
One, two. One, two. One, two.

790
01:19:03,221 --> 01:19:05,473
Come on.

791
01:19:10,144 --> 01:19:12,980
Come on, now. OK, push up.

792
01:19:13,064 --> 01:19:17,777
Come on, Charlie. Do it like a champ, will ya?

793
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:22,448
Keep doin' it like that, Charlie. Come on.

794
01:19:23,533 --> 01:19:25,410
Hey, Scholzy.

795
01:19:25,493 --> 01:19:30,081
Repeat till your brains are dusty. Come on.

796
01:19:37,588 --> 01:19:40,800
Come on, Charlie. Do it like a champ.

797
01:22:52,241 --> 01:22:55,495
- Good luck, Andy.
- Good luck, Harry.

798
01:22:57,622 --> 01:22:59,707
Monty.

799
01:24:52,278 --> 01:24:56,491
Your Highness, may I introduce
Mr Tom Watson, representing New Zealand?

800
01:24:56,574 --> 01:25:00,536
- You've come a long way.
- I'm from Oxford, sir. They wrote to me.

801
01:25:00,620 --> 01:25:02,955
Said as I was here, I might as well take part.

802
01:25:03,039 --> 01:25:06,834
- Economical. But can you run?
- I'll give it a try, sir.

803
01:25:06,918 --> 01:25:10,755
- That's the spirit. Best of luck to you.
- Thank you, sir.

804
01:25:25,978 --> 01:25:29,315
- The royal benediction, no less.
- The chap's invaluable.

805
01:25:29,399 --> 01:25:34,529
- Hear, hear. Henry V and all that.
- Protocol, Monty. Protocol.

806
01:25:34,612 --> 01:25:40,118
He's here to show us what may be done -
and more essentially, what may not be.

807
01:25:40,201 --> 01:25:42,412
I'm Jackson Scholz. How do you do?

808
01:25:42,537 --> 01:25:44,747
I'm Eric Liddell.

809
01:25:44,831 --> 01:25:50,211
Well, we've heard a lot about you.
It's good to meet you at last.

810
01:25:51,337 --> 01:25:53,923
- Ah, Liddell.
- Excuse me.

811
01:25:55,425 --> 01:25:57,593
I was afraid you weren't here.

812
01:25:57,677 --> 01:26:00,263
I'm afraid I am, sir.

813
01:26:00,346 --> 01:26:05,017
Fine. Do you good.
Take you out of yourself a bit.

814
01:26:05,101 --> 01:26:09,147
The Prince of Wales would like to meet you.

815
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:11,524
No. No.

816
01:26:11,607 --> 01:26:14,610
No, sir. It wouldn't be right.

817
01:26:14,694 --> 01:26:20,450
Liddell, he is your future king.
Are you refusing to shake his hand?

818
01:26:20,533 --> 01:26:24,996
Does your arrogance extend that far?

819
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:29,500
My arrogance, sir, extends
just as far as my conscience demands.

820
01:26:29,584 --> 01:26:31,294
Fine.

821
01:26:31,377 --> 01:26:37,091
Then let's hope that's wise enough
to give you room for manoeuvre.

822
01:26:41,137 --> 01:26:45,725
- All right, sir.
- Splendid. I'll take you to him now.

823
01:27:00,073 --> 01:27:04,952
Your Royal Highness,
may I present Mr Eric Liddell?

824
01:27:05,036 --> 01:27:07,121
Delighted, Liddell. Delighted.

825
01:27:07,205 --> 01:27:09,957
I saw you play for Scotland.
It depressed me no end.

826
01:27:10,041 --> 01:27:13,961
- Ran in a couple of tries from your own half.
- I believe I did, sir.

827
01:27:14,045 --> 01:27:20,009
Nice to have you on the same side at last.
Excellent effort of Lindsay's, don't you think?

828
01:27:20,093 --> 01:27:25,348
- He did well, sir. He did indeed.
- An example to us all.

829
01:27:25,431 --> 01:27:30,394
May I introduce the Duke of Sutherland,
president of our Olympic Association?

830
01:27:30,478 --> 01:27:34,899
- How do you do?
- And our chairman, Lord Cadogan.

831
01:27:34,982 --> 01:27:37,777
Have a seat.

832
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:40,446
Make yourself comfortable.

833
01:27:40,530 --> 01:27:42,698
Cigar?

834
01:27:42,782 --> 01:27:45,451
No, of course. You don't. Nor drink.

835
01:27:45,535 --> 01:27:51,666
Such is the resolution of the young man
you have before you, gentlemen.

836
01:27:57,088 --> 01:27:59,632
Lord Birkenhead has told us of your attitude

837
01:27:59,715 --> 01:28:03,970
towards your participation
in the 100 metres heats, Liddell.

838
01:28:04,053 --> 01:28:08,307
- Would nonparticipation be more accurate?
- It would, sir, yes.

839
01:28:08,391 --> 01:28:11,561
We were consulted as to
how we should approach the French.

840
01:28:11,644 --> 01:28:16,899
Something we just can't allow to happen,
going cap in hand to the Frogs, of all people.

841
01:28:16,983 --> 01:28:18,735
Simply out of the question.

842
01:28:18,818 --> 01:28:23,364
A simple matter of national dignity.
Being a patriot, I'm sure you understand.

843
01:28:23,448 --> 01:28:26,784
I must say, sir,
I felt it was an impractical suggestion.

844
01:28:26,868 --> 01:28:31,289
Why didn't you damn well say so?
As an athlete, you value economy of effort.

845
01:28:31,372 --> 01:28:35,042
I wanted to run.
I was desperate enough to try anything.

846
01:28:35,126 --> 01:28:40,131
All that being understood,
we decided to invite you in for a little chat

847
01:28:40,214 --> 01:28:43,342
to see if there's any way
we can resolve the situation.

848
01:28:43,426 --> 01:28:48,848
There's only one to resolve it.
That's for him to change his mind and run.

849
01:28:48,931 --> 01:28:56,147
Don't state the obvious. We've to explore
ways in which we can help him decide that.

850
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:58,357
I'm afraid there are no ways, sir.

851
01:28:58,441 --> 01:29:02,195
I won't run on the Sabbath and that's final.

852
01:29:03,321 --> 01:29:06,908
I intended to confirm this
with Lord Birkenhead tonight,

853
01:29:06,991 --> 01:29:11,287
- even before this inquisition.
- Don't be impertinent.

854
01:29:11,370 --> 01:29:15,500
The impertinence lies with those
who influence a man to deny his beliefs.

855
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:19,420
On the contrary.
We're appealing to your beliefs.

856
01:29:19,504 --> 01:29:22,715
In your country and your king.
Your loyalty to them.

857
01:29:22,799 --> 01:29:27,178
Hear, hear.
In my day, it was king first, God after.

858
01:29:27,261 --> 01:29:31,307
Yes, and the war to end wars
bitterly proved your point.

859
01:29:31,390 --> 01:29:37,605
God made countries. God makes kings
and the rules by which they govern.

860
01:29:38,856 --> 01:29:43,569
And those rules say that the Sabbath is his.

861
01:29:43,653 --> 01:29:47,907
And I for one intend to keep it that way.

862
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:54,372
Mr Liddell,
you're a child of your race, as I am.

863
01:29:54,455 --> 01:29:59,502
We share a common heritage,
a common bond, a common loyalty.

864
01:29:59,585 --> 01:30:05,341
There are times when we are asked to make
sacrifices in the name of that loyalty,

865
01:30:05,425 --> 01:30:08,803
and without them our allegiance is worthless.

866
01:30:08,886 --> 01:30:11,139
As I see it, for you,

867
01:30:11,639 --> 01:30:13,808
this is such a time.

868
01:30:13,891 --> 01:30:15,768
Sir...

869
01:30:18,354 --> 01:30:21,566
God knows I love my country.

870
01:30:21,649 --> 01:30:24,986
But I can't make that sacrifice.

871
01:30:30,533 --> 01:30:33,202
Come in.

872
01:30:33,286 --> 01:30:36,414
Your Royal Highness, Lord Lindsay.

873
01:30:41,502 --> 01:30:45,006
Your Highness, Lord Cadogan, gentlemen.

874
01:30:45,089 --> 01:30:47,300
I do apologise for barging in like this.

875
01:30:47,383 --> 01:30:50,762
The fact is I am fully aware of Eric's dilemma.

876
01:30:50,845 --> 01:30:55,558
I wondered if I could be so bold
as to suggest a possible solution.

877
01:30:55,641 --> 01:30:57,560
Do.

878
01:30:57,643 --> 01:30:59,353
Yes.

879
01:30:59,437 --> 01:31:02,148
Another day, another race.

880
01:31:02,231 --> 01:31:06,235
- What the devil's that supposed to mean?
- It's quite simple, sir.

881
01:31:06,319 --> 01:31:08,654
The 400 metres. It's on Thursday.

882
01:31:08,738 --> 01:31:14,744
I've already got my medal, so why don't
you let Eric take my place in the quarter?

883
01:31:17,413 --> 01:31:23,878
I think that's a splendid idea. Can we allow
him to change events at such short notice?

884
01:31:23,961 --> 01:31:26,380
That's a matter for the committee.

885
01:31:26,464 --> 01:31:31,427
We are the committee.
I think it's a very good idea.

886
01:31:31,511 --> 01:31:33,471
David?

887
01:31:34,514 --> 01:31:36,682
All those in favour say aye.

888
01:31:36,766 --> 01:31:38,684
Aye.

889
01:31:38,768 --> 01:31:40,520
Liddell?

890
01:31:41,437 --> 01:31:44,399
- Andy, I...
- A pleasure, old chap.

891
01:31:45,358 --> 01:31:47,860
Just to see you run.

892
01:31:51,489 --> 01:31:53,658
Aye.

893
01:31:53,741 --> 01:31:56,911
Well, that's settled.

894
01:32:00,289 --> 01:32:02,792
A sticky moment, George.

895
01:32:02,875 --> 01:32:06,712
Thank God for Lindsay.
I thought the lad had us beaten.

896
01:32:06,796 --> 01:32:11,884
- He did have us beaten. Thank God he did.
- I don't quite follow you.

897
01:32:11,968 --> 01:32:16,806
The lad, as you call him,
is a true man of principle, and a true athlete.

898
01:32:16,889 --> 01:32:20,726
His speed is a mere extension
of his life, its force.

899
01:32:20,810 --> 01:32:23,688
We sought to sever his running from himself.

900
01:32:23,771 --> 01:32:26,065
For his country's sake, yes.

901
01:32:26,149 --> 01:32:28,484
No sake is worth that, FE.

902
01:32:28,568 --> 01:32:31,779
Least of all a guilty national pride.

903
01:32:48,463 --> 01:32:51,174
"Lindsay makes way for Liddell. "

904
01:32:51,257 --> 01:32:56,596
"400 metres for defecting Scot. "
"'Smacks of fanaticism,' says official. "

905
01:32:56,679 --> 01:33:00,933
"'Man of principle,' says Primate. "
"'We should be proud. "'

906
01:33:42,266 --> 01:33:45,853
- So that's the Olympic Stadium.
- That's it, Sam.

907
01:33:45,937 --> 01:33:52,777
- It's as good as being in there, isn't it?
- Better. Seeing as I'm persona non grata.

908
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:54,862
Yeah.

909
01:33:54,946 --> 01:34:00,034
It's tiptop, Mr Abrahams. You've done a grand
job. If we don't win now, we never will.

910
01:34:00,118 --> 01:34:04,288
Have I got everything, Sam?
Everything you need?

911
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:12,338
Yes. All we need now is Sunday.

912
01:34:34,444 --> 01:34:39,323
My text this afternoon
is taken from Isaiah, chapter 40.

913
01:34:42,243 --> 01:34:43,995
"Behold. "

914
01:34:45,079 --> 01:34:48,624
"The nations are as a drop in the bucket

915
01:34:48,708 --> 01:34:53,421
and are counted
as the small dust in the balance. "

916
01:34:54,338 --> 01:34:58,634
"All nations before him are as nothing. "

917
01:34:58,718 --> 01:35:03,598
"They are counted to him
less than nothing and vanity. "

918
01:35:05,683 --> 01:35:09,062
"He bringeth the princes to nothing. "

919
01:35:09,145 --> 01:35:12,857
"He maketh the judges of the earth
as a vanity. "

920
01:35:14,442 --> 01:35:16,778
"Hast thou not known?"

921
01:35:17,904 --> 01:35:20,823
"Hast thou not heard

922
01:35:20,907 --> 01:35:24,368
that the everlasting God, the Lord,

923
01:35:24,452 --> 01:35:26,954
the creator of the ends of the earth,

924
01:35:27,038 --> 01:35:30,917
fainteth not, neither is weary?"

925
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,877
Juvenile.

926
01:35:37,715 --> 01:35:42,428
- Oldest con in the business.
- I know, Sam.

927
01:35:42,512 --> 01:35:45,973
"He giveth power to the faint,

928
01:35:46,057 --> 01:35:51,479
and to them that have no strength
he increaseth might. "

929
01:35:54,399 --> 01:35:57,652
"But they that wait upon the Lord

930
01:35:57,735 --> 01:36:00,446
shall renew their strength. "

931
01:36:01,531 --> 01:36:06,869
"They shall mount up with wings, as eagles. "

932
01:36:08,746 --> 01:36:11,124
"They shall run,

933
01:36:11,207 --> 01:36:14,377
and not be weary. "

934
01:36:14,460 --> 01:36:17,046
"They shall walk,

935
01:36:17,130 --> 01:36:19,424
and not faint. "

936
01:36:52,665 --> 01:36:57,587
Do you remember when we first
bumped into each other, old man?

937
01:36:57,670 --> 01:37:00,089
We shared a taxi, remember?

938
01:37:02,008 --> 01:37:04,677
You made me feel

939
01:37:04,761 --> 01:37:08,389
an age old, burdened, sour...

940
01:37:08,473 --> 01:37:10,767
Even superior.

941
01:37:12,101 --> 01:37:15,521
That was the miscalculation of my life.

942
01:37:16,564 --> 01:37:18,941
You, Aubrey,

943
01:37:19,025 --> 01:37:21,527
are my most complete man.

944
01:37:21,611 --> 01:37:23,863
You're brave,

945
01:37:23,946 --> 01:37:25,823
compassionate,

946
01:37:25,907 --> 01:37:27,867
kind.

947
01:37:27,950 --> 01:37:32,330
A content man. That's your secret.

948
01:37:32,413 --> 01:37:35,416
Contentment.

949
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:38,169
I'm 24 and I've never known it.

950
01:37:39,212 --> 01:37:44,926
I'm forever in pursuit and I don't
even know what it is I'm chasing.

951
01:37:48,679 --> 01:37:51,265
Aubrey, old chap, I'm scared.

952
01:37:53,726 --> 01:37:59,232
Sam and I, we've laboured,
rowed and bullied for this.

953
01:37:59,315 --> 01:38:01,484
Day in, day out.

954
01:38:01,567 --> 01:38:05,029
You've seen us -
chuckled over us, I'll be bound.

955
01:38:05,113 --> 01:38:09,117
Out in all weathers. Madmen.

956
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:12,120
And for what?

957
01:38:12,203 --> 01:38:14,956
I was beaten out of sight in the 200.

958
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:20,128
I let Paddock trick me in the semi.

959
01:38:20,211 --> 01:38:24,507
Now, in one hour's time,
I'll be out there again.

960
01:38:24,590 --> 01:38:28,928
I'll raise my eyes and
look down that corridor, four feet wide,

961
01:38:29,011 --> 01:38:34,100
with ten lonely seconds
to justify my whole existence.

962
01:38:35,309 --> 01:38:37,603
But will I?

963
01:38:42,275 --> 01:38:45,445
Aubrey, I've known the fear of losing,

964
01:38:45,528 --> 01:38:49,073
but now I'm almost too frightened to win.

965
01:39:56,516 --> 01:40:01,771
Dear Mr Abrahams. You must please pardon
my not coming to see you run,

966
01:40:01,854 --> 01:40:04,065
much as I would like to do so.

967
01:40:04,148 --> 01:40:09,529
However, I believe and hope
you will win the 100 metres.

968
01:40:11,030 --> 01:40:13,866
Go out determined to do your best.

969
01:40:13,950 --> 01:40:18,246
And don't forget, drop down at the first stride.

970
01:40:19,288 --> 01:40:21,833
Get well warmed up,

971
01:40:21,916 --> 01:40:25,711
and then let the gun release you.

972
01:40:25,795 --> 01:40:29,715
I should use the springy old six-spike shoes.

973
01:40:31,217 --> 01:40:35,888
All the best of luck.
From yours truly, Sam Mussabini.

974
01:40:39,183 --> 01:40:42,729
PS. Please accept the charm.

975
01:40:43,354 --> 01:40:46,065
My old father swore by it.

976
01:41:49,879 --> 01:41:54,675
No regrets, Eric,
that you're not down there with them?

977
01:41:55,927 --> 01:41:57,595
Yeah.

978
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:01,724
No doubts, though.

979
01:42:01,808 --> 01:42:04,936
May I present
Mr Bowman of the United States?

980
01:42:05,019 --> 01:42:06,938
Mr Bowman.

981
01:42:07,021 --> 01:42:10,274
- Mr Murchison.
- Mr Murchison.

982
01:42:10,358 --> 01:42:12,777
Mr Watson of New Zealand
I believe you know.

983
01:42:12,860 --> 01:42:15,530
- Yes, Mr Watson. How are you?
- Very well, sir.

984
01:42:15,613 --> 01:42:17,031
Good.

985
01:42:17,115 --> 01:42:20,284
- Mr Paddock.
- Ah, Mr Paddock.

986
01:42:20,368 --> 01:42:23,287
Dinner for your whole team
when we get back to London.

987
01:42:23,371 --> 01:42:28,501
Now, if you win, I pay.
Abrahams wins, you pay, all right?

988
01:42:28,584 --> 01:42:31,629
Sir, you have yourself a deal.

989
01:42:32,755 --> 01:42:35,925
- Done. The best of luck to you.
- And to you, too, sir.

990
01:42:36,008 --> 01:42:39,053
- Mr Scholz.
- Scholz.

991
01:42:39,137 --> 01:42:41,305
And this is our Harold Abrahams.

992
01:42:41,389 --> 01:42:46,352
Good luck, Abrahams.
Do your best. That's all we can expect.

993
01:42:46,436 --> 01:42:49,105
- Good luck, Abrahams.
- Thank you, sir.

994
01:42:49,188 --> 01:42:51,482
Come on, Charlie.

995
01:45:31,142 --> 01:45:33,019
Head down.

996
01:45:33,102 --> 01:45:35,855
Watch the first stride.

997
01:45:35,938 --> 01:45:38,232
Go for release.

998
01:48:04,962 --> 01:48:06,839
Harold.

999
01:48:25,525 --> 01:48:27,610
My son.

1000
01:48:49,799 --> 01:48:52,009
Harold.

1001
01:48:52,093 --> 01:48:54,887
- Leave him be. The poor fella's whacked.
- But he won.

1002
01:48:54,971 --> 01:48:59,809
Exactly. Now, one of these days, Monty,
you're going to win yourself,

1003
01:48:59,892 --> 01:49:03,229
and it's pretty difficult to swallow.

1004
01:49:11,028 --> 01:49:13,197
Come in.

1005
01:49:13,281 --> 01:49:17,827
Mrs Abrahams just rang, miss. The Daily
Express, they've been on from Paris.

1006
01:49:17,910 --> 01:49:23,499
Mr Harold. He won.
She told me to tell you, he won.

1007
01:49:23,583 --> 01:49:26,294
Thank you very much, Bill.

1008
01:49:27,879 --> 01:49:31,424
It's 15 minutes to curtain-up, miss.

1009
01:49:44,353 --> 01:49:46,647
He did it, sir.

1010
01:49:51,694 --> 01:49:54,572
Thank you, Matthews.

1011
01:49:54,655 --> 01:49:57,075
"Abrahams triumphant. "

1012
01:49:58,159 --> 01:50:03,247
"Caius College athlete
wins blue riband at Games. "

1013
01:50:03,331 --> 01:50:05,750
Just as I expected.

1014
01:50:16,302 --> 01:50:20,681
Yes, you've always thought
of yourself as a ruthless man. Hard.

1015
01:50:20,765 --> 01:50:23,518
Bit of a loner, like me.

1016
01:50:23,601 --> 01:50:27,939
But actually, you're as soft as a limp pocket.

1017
01:50:28,022 --> 01:50:30,316
You care.

1018
01:50:32,235 --> 01:50:36,072
Care about things that really matter.

1019
01:50:36,155 --> 01:50:41,369
If you didn't, I wouldn't have come
within a mile of you.

1020
01:50:43,913 --> 01:50:46,833
Do you know who you won for
out there today?

1021
01:50:49,127 --> 01:50:51,003
Us.

1022
01:50:52,130 --> 01:50:57,969
You and old Sam Mussabini.
I've waited 30 bloody years for this.

1023
01:51:06,227 --> 01:51:08,104
Harold.

1024
01:51:09,814 --> 01:51:12,233
It means the world to me, this, you know.

1025
01:51:14,652 --> 01:51:18,573
And if all the world can do
is to want to go home to bed,

1026
01:51:18,656 --> 01:51:21,951
then they can go to hell.

1027
01:51:22,034 --> 01:51:25,955
Because we've had today, you and me,

1028
01:51:26,038 --> 01:51:29,208
and we've got it for keeps.

1029
01:51:29,292 --> 01:51:31,544
So now it's out of your system,

1030
01:51:31,627 --> 01:51:37,133
go home to that girl of yours
and start some bloody living. Yes?

1031
01:51:48,519 --> 01:51:50,897
To Sam Mussabini.

1032
01:51:50,980 --> 01:51:54,275
The greatest trainer in the world.

1033
01:52:03,284 --> 01:52:05,620
Let's get some... Get some more.

1034
01:52:05,703 --> 01:52:08,331
Come on, Sam. We're going home.

1035
01:52:32,397 --> 01:52:35,608
The final of the 400 metres.

1036
01:52:41,197 --> 01:52:46,077
Good luck. Don't expect
I'll see you till after the race.

1037
01:52:50,331 --> 01:52:52,667
This guy Liddell, is he a problem?

1038
01:52:52,750 --> 01:52:58,714
No problem. He's a flyer.
He's had two races today already. He'll die.

1039
01:52:58,798 --> 01:53:02,093
Just swing along, you guys, and wait.

1040
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:07,056
After 300 metres, rigor mortis sets in.

1041
01:53:07,140 --> 01:53:10,143
You'll pull him in on a rope.

1042
01:53:14,439 --> 01:53:17,024
Good luck, Taylor. Watch out for Liddell.

1043
01:53:17,108 --> 01:53:21,070
- Coach says no problem.
- He's got something personal to prove.

1044
01:53:21,154 --> 01:53:26,200
Something guys like Coach'll
never understand in a million years.

1045
01:53:45,762 --> 01:53:51,809
"It says in the Old Book,
'He that honours me, I will honour. "'

1046
01:53:52,351 --> 01:53:55,521
"Good luck. Jackson Scholz. "

1047
01:54:25,968 --> 01:54:30,556
So where does the power come from
to see the race to its end?

1048
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:32,892
From within.

1049
01:54:42,110 --> 01:54:44,612
Come on, Liddell.

1050
01:54:54,872 --> 01:54:59,293
Jennie, I believe God made me for a purpose.

1051
01:55:00,378 --> 01:55:03,840
But he also made me fast.

1052
01:55:03,923 --> 01:55:07,677
And when I run, I feel his pleasure.

1053
01:59:29,272 --> 01:59:32,442
Well, Andy. He did it.

1054
01:59:34,402 --> 01:59:38,740
- What's that, old boy?
- He ran them off their feet.
