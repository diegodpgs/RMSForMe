1
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:24,488
Rachel, let me see.

2
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:33,325
-Can l see?
-Finders keepers. And l found it.

3
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:34,972
ln my garden.

4
00:00:36,613 --> 00:00:38,365
Finders keepers.

5
00:00:45,053 --> 00:00:46,486
Bruce?

6
00:00:51,293 --> 00:00:52,931
Bruce?

7
00:00:55,173 --> 00:00:57,528
Mom! Mr. Alfred!

8
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:21,603
Did you have dream?

9
00:01:22,053 --> 00:01:23,850
Nightmare.

10
00:01:28,053 --> 00:01:29,452
Worse than this place?

11
00:01:50,573 --> 00:01:52,450
They are going to fight you.

12
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:54,371
-Again?
-Until they kill you.

13
00:01:56,493 --> 00:01:58,211
Can they kill me before breakfast?

14
00:02:00,493 --> 00:02:03,212
You are in hell, little man.

15
00:02:06,373 --> 00:02:09,046
And l am the devil.

16
00:02:12,293 --> 00:02:13,692
You're not the devil.

17
00:02:13,692 --> 00:02:15,172
You're practice.

18
00:02:56,853 --> 00:02:58,081
Solitary.

19
00:02:58,081 --> 00:03:00,084
-Why?
-For protection.

20
00:03:00,773 --> 00:03:03,003
-l don't need protection.
-Protection for them.

21
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:08,444
Get in.

22
00:03:12,253 --> 00:03:14,209
Are you so desperate
to fight criminals...

23
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:16,933
...that you lock yourself in
to take them on one at a time?

24
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:21,887
Actually, there were seven of them.

25
00:03:21,887 --> 00:03:24,248
l counted six, Mr. Wayne.

26
00:03:27,853 --> 00:03:29,047
How do you know my name?

27
00:03:29,047 --> 00:03:32,125
The world is too small for someone
like Bruce Wayne to disappear...

28
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,523
...no matter how deep
he chooses to sink.

29
00:03:34,523 --> 00:03:35,808
Who are you?

30
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:39,010
My name is merely Ducard,
but l speak for Ra's al Ghul...

31
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,643
...a man greatly feared
by the criminal underworld.

32
00:03:42,643 --> 00:03:44,326
A man who can offer you a path.

33
00:03:45,213 --> 00:03:47,602
What makes you think l need a path?

34
00:03:47,973 --> 00:03:50,487
Someone like you
is only here by choice.

35
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:52,928
You have been exploring
the criminal fraternity...

36
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:55,448
...but whatever
your original intentions...

37
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:59,330
...you have become truly lost.

38
00:04:00,813 --> 00:04:04,442
And what path can Ra's al Ghul offer?

39
00:04:04,442 --> 00:04:08,447
The path of a man
who shares his hatred of evil...

40
00:04:08,447 --> 00:04:11,685
...and wishes to serve true justice.

41
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:14,169
The path of the League of Shadows.

42
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:19,328
-You're vigilantes.
-No, no, no.

43
00:04:19,328 --> 00:04:23,486
A vigilante is just a man lost in
the scramble for his own gratification.

44
00:04:23,486 --> 00:04:27,168
He can be destroyed or locked up.

45
00:04:28,493 --> 00:04:33,089
But if you make yourself more
than just a man...

46
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:36,131
...if you devote yourself to an ideal...

47
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:38,682
...and if they can't stop you...

48
00:04:39,053 --> 00:04:41,408
...then you become
something else entirely.

49
00:04:43,013 --> 00:04:44,492
Which is?

50
00:04:44,973 --> 00:04:47,806
Legend, Mr. Wayne.

51
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:50,651
Tomorrow, you will be released.

52
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:54,044
lf you are bored of brawling with thieves
and want to achieve something...

53
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:57,569
...there is a rare blue flower
that grows on the eastern slopes.

54
00:04:57,569 --> 00:04:59,325
Pick one of these flowers.

55
00:04:59,325 --> 00:05:02,326
lf you can carry it
to the top of the mountain...

56
00:05:02,326 --> 00:05:05,291
...you may find what you were
looking for in the first place.

57
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:08,092
And what was l looking for?

58
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:11,610
Only you can know that.

59
00:06:16,013 --> 00:06:19,483
You turn back. You go back.

60
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,244
Ra's al Ghul?

61
00:07:36,053 --> 00:07:37,566
Wait.

62
00:07:40,453 --> 00:07:41,681
What are you seeking?

63
00:07:42,573 --> 00:07:44,484
l seek...

64
00:07:45,973 --> 00:07:48,123
...the means to fight injustice.

65
00:07:48,493 --> 00:07:50,529
To turn fear...

66
00:07:50,853 --> 00:07:53,572
...against those
who prey on the fearful.

67
00:08:14,373 --> 00:08:17,331
To manipulate the fears in others...

68
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:21,409
...you must first master your own.

69
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:23,651
Are you ready to begin?

70
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:27,001
l can.... l can barely stand.

71
00:08:27,001 --> 00:08:29,403
Death does not wait
for you to be ready!

72
00:08:29,403 --> 00:08:32,610
Death is not considerate or fair!

73
00:08:33,093 --> 00:08:37,530
And make no mistake,
here you face death.

74
00:08:41,253 --> 00:08:42,527
Tiger.

75
00:08:44,093 --> 00:08:45,811
Jujitsu.

76
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:48,922
Panther.

77
00:08:52,293 --> 00:08:54,523
You're skilled. But this is not a dance.

78
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,252
And you are afraid.

79
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:05,890
But not of me.

80
00:09:09,213 --> 00:09:11,602
Tell us, Mr. Wayne...

81
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:18,970
...what do you fear?

82
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,086
Bruce?

83
00:09:31,653 --> 00:09:34,042
lt's okay. lt's okay.

84
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:35,646
You'll be okay.

85
00:09:35,893 --> 00:09:38,088
Will we be needing an ambulance,
Master Wayne?

86
00:09:38,088 --> 00:09:41,131
No, l'll set the bone
and take him for an x-ray later.

87
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:42,487
Very good, sir.

88
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:46,482
-l'm very sorry, sir. l've told--
-Don't worry. lt's fine.

89
00:09:48,693 --> 00:09:50,570
Took quite a fall, didn't we,
Master Bruce?

90
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:51,961
And why do we fall, Bruce?

91
00:09:52,293 --> 00:09:55,251
So we can learn to pick ourselves up.

92
00:09:58,893 --> 00:10:01,612
Just a little fall.
lt's just a small fracture.

93
00:10:10,213 --> 00:10:11,965
The bats again?

94
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:17,049
You know why they attacked you,
don't you?

95
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:20,445
-They were afraid of you.
-Afraid of me?

96
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:22,524
All creatures feel fear.

97
00:10:22,524 --> 00:10:23,967
Even the scary ones?

98
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:25,930
Especially the scary ones.

99
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,011
l got something to show you.

100
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:35,330
-You think your mother will like them?
-Yeah.

101
00:10:35,973 --> 00:10:38,043
-l think it's time to get up.
-Maybe.

102
00:10:38,043 --> 00:10:39,771
No going back to bed.

103
00:10:42,853 --> 00:10:44,889
Did you build this train, Dad?

104
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:49,569
Gotham's been good to our family,
but the city's been suffering.

105
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:53,089
People less fortunate than us
have been enduring very hard times.

106
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:57,041
So we built a new, cheap, public
transportation system to unite the city.

107
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,851
And at the center...

108
00:10:58,851 --> 00:11:00,765
...Wayne Tower.

109
00:11:00,765 --> 00:11:03,686
-ls that where you work?
-No, l work at the hospital.

110
00:11:03,686 --> 00:11:06,925
l leave the running of our company
to much better men.

111
00:11:06,925 --> 00:11:08,890
-Better?
-Well...

112
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,203
...more interested men.

113
00:12:05,293 --> 00:12:06,646
Can we go?

114
00:12:08,933 --> 00:12:10,366
Please.

115
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:12,889
Okay. Let's go.

116
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:24,486
-What's wrong, Bruce?
-No, no. lt was me.

117
00:12:24,486 --> 00:12:26,689
l just needed some fresh air.

118
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:29,890
A little bit of opera goes a long way.
Right, Bruce?

119
00:12:32,413 --> 00:12:35,007
Come on. Let's go.

120
00:12:40,253 --> 00:12:41,925
Wallets, jewelry. Come on, fast.

121
00:12:41,925 --> 00:12:43,412
-That's fine.
-Fast.

122
00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:45,086
Take it easy.

123
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:47,212
Take it easy.

124
00:12:47,973 --> 00:12:49,372
Here you go.

125
00:12:52,013 --> 00:12:54,732
lt's fine. lt's fine.

126
00:12:55,573 --> 00:12:58,565
Now just take it and go.

127
00:12:58,565 --> 00:13:00,451
-l said, jewelry.
-Hey--

128
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:03,687
Thomas!

129
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,931
Bruce.

130
00:13:15,453 --> 00:13:16,772
lt's okay.

131
00:13:19,813 --> 00:13:21,451
Don't be afraid.

132
00:13:51,973 --> 00:13:53,691
ls this your father's?

133
00:13:55,173 --> 00:13:57,209
lt's okay.

134
00:13:58,373 --> 00:13:59,931
Come here.

135
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:04,649
There you go.

136
00:14:07,653 --> 00:14:09,564
lt's okay.

137
00:14:11,253 --> 00:14:13,084
lt's okay.

138
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:18,366
Gordon.

139
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:27,646
Hey.

140
00:14:28,253 --> 00:14:29,402
Good news.

141
00:14:30,813 --> 00:14:32,610
We got him, son.

142
00:14:52,413 --> 00:14:54,210
You're in excellent hands.

143
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,965
We'll be watching the empire.

144
00:14:55,965 --> 00:14:59,011
When you grow up,
it'll be waiting for you.

145
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:17,365
l thought l might prepare
a little supper.

146
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,324
-Very well.
-Alfred?

147
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:30,044
-Yes, Master Bruce?
-lt was my fault, Alfred.

148
00:15:30,044 --> 00:15:31,805
-l made them leave the theater.
-No.

149
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,885
-lf l hadn't gotten scared....
-lt was nothing that you did.

150
00:15:35,973 --> 00:15:39,170
lt was him, and him alone.

151
00:15:39,653 --> 00:15:41,086
Do you understand?

152
00:15:44,093 --> 00:15:47,005
l miss them, Alfred.
l miss them so much.

153
00:15:47,005 --> 00:15:49,084
So do l, Master Bruce.

154
00:15:51,413 --> 00:15:52,607
So do l.

155
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:57,486
And do you still feel responsible
for your parents' death?

156
00:15:57,486 --> 00:15:59,689
My anger outweighs my guilt.

157
00:16:00,413 --> 00:16:01,732
Come.

158
00:16:06,213 --> 00:16:08,807
You have learned to bury
your guilt with anger.

159
00:16:08,807 --> 00:16:11,885
l will teach you to confront it
and to face the truth.

160
00:16:14,293 --> 00:16:19,048
You know how to fight six men.
We can teach you how to engage 600.

161
00:16:20,253 --> 00:16:22,050
You know how to disappear.

162
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,329
We can teach you
to become truly invisible.

163
00:16:25,893 --> 00:16:27,531
lnvisible?

164
00:16:31,373 --> 00:16:35,810
The ninja understands that invisibility
is a matter of patience and agility.

165
00:16:48,253 --> 00:16:49,891
Always mind your surroundings.

166
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:55,049
Ninjitsu employs explosive powders.

167
00:16:56,493 --> 00:16:58,643
-As weapons?
-Or distractions.

168
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:01,043
Theatricality and deception
are powerful agents.

169
00:17:01,493 --> 00:17:04,405
You must become more than just a man
in the mind of your opponent.

170
00:17:06,613 --> 00:17:08,649
-Who is he?
-He was a farmer.

171
00:17:08,649 --> 00:17:11,930
Then he tried to take his neighbor's land
and became a murderer.

172
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,288
-Now he is a prisoner.
-What'll happen to him?

173
00:17:14,288 --> 00:17:16,762
Justice. Crime cannot be tolerated.

174
00:17:16,762 --> 00:17:20,721
Criminals thrive on the indulgence
of society's understanding.

175
00:17:24,613 --> 00:17:27,332
Your parents' death
was not your fault.

176
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,527
lt was your father's.

177
00:17:56,573 --> 00:17:59,292
Anger does not change the fact
that your father failed to act.

178
00:17:59,292 --> 00:18:01,569
-The man had a gun.
-Would that stop you?

179
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,482
l've had training.

180
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,405
The training is nothing!

181
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:07,165
Will is everything!

182
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:14,485
The will to act.

183
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,047
Yield.

184
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,686
You haven't beaten me.

185
00:18:26,686 --> 00:18:29,447
You have sacrificed sure footing
for a killing stroke.

186
00:18:36,773 --> 00:18:38,491
Rub your chest.

187
00:18:38,973 --> 00:18:41,726
Your arms will
take care of themselves.

188
00:18:44,293 --> 00:18:45,851
You are stronger than your father.

189
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:48,051
You didn't know my father.

190
00:18:48,051 --> 00:18:50,408
But l know the rage that drives you.

191
00:18:50,408 --> 00:18:52,768
That impossible anger
strangling the grief...

192
00:18:52,768 --> 00:18:55,493
...until the memory
of your loved one is just...

193
00:18:55,493 --> 00:18:57,564
...poison in your veins.

194
00:18:57,564 --> 00:19:02,011
And one day, you catch yourself wishing
the person you loved had never existed...

195
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:05,728
...so you'd be spared your pain.

196
00:19:08,613 --> 00:19:11,844
l wasn't always here in the mountains.

197
00:19:13,413 --> 00:19:15,369
Once, l had a wife.

198
00:19:16,293 --> 00:19:18,124
My great love.

199
00:19:19,253 --> 00:19:21,289
She was taken from me.

200
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:24,525
Like you, l was forced to learn
there are those without decency...

201
00:19:24,525 --> 00:19:27,844
...who must be fought
without hesitation, without pity.

202
00:19:29,573 --> 00:19:31,803
Your anger gives you great power.

203
00:19:32,293 --> 00:19:35,683
But if you let it, it will destroy you...

204
00:19:36,213 --> 00:19:38,044
...as it almost did me.

205
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:40,807
-What stopped it?
-Vengeance.

206
00:19:40,807 --> 00:19:42,850
That's no help to me.

207
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,765
Why, Bruce?

208
00:19:44,765 --> 00:19:47,493
Why could you not
avenge your parents?

209
00:19:51,173 --> 00:19:54,483
Will you be heading back to Princeton
after the hearing, sir...

210
00:19:54,483 --> 00:19:57,213
...or can l persuade you to stay on
for a day or two?

211
00:19:57,213 --> 00:19:59,489
l'm not heading back at all.

212
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,609
-You don't like it there?
-l like it fine.

213
00:20:02,013 --> 00:20:04,686
They just don't feel the same way.

214
00:20:05,453 --> 00:20:08,968
-l've prepared the master bedroom.
-No.

215
00:20:08,968 --> 00:20:10,486
My room will be fine.

216
00:20:10,486 --> 00:20:13,087
With all due respect, sir,
Wayne Manor is your house.

217
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,005
No, Alfred, it's my father's house.

218
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,448
-Your father is dead.
-This place is a mausoleum.

219
00:20:17,448 --> 00:20:20,525
lf l have my way, l'll pull
the damn thing down brick by brick.

220
00:20:20,525 --> 00:20:24,606
This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered
six generations of your family.

221
00:20:24,606 --> 00:20:27,367
Why do you give a damn, Alfred?
lt's not your family.

222
00:20:28,173 --> 00:20:31,882
l give a damn because a good man
once made me responsible...

223
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:34,603
...for what was
most precious to him...

224
00:20:34,603 --> 00:20:36,923
...in the whole world.

225
00:20:38,813 --> 00:20:42,203
Miss Dawes has offered
to drive you to the hearing.

226
00:20:42,203 --> 00:20:44,329
She probably hopes
to talk you out of going.

227
00:20:44,329 --> 00:20:47,803
Should l just bury the past out there
with my parents, Alfred?

228
00:20:47,803 --> 00:20:50,931
l wouldn't presume to tell you
what to do with your past, sir.

229
00:20:50,931 --> 00:20:54,972
Just know that there are those of us who
care about what you do with your future.

230
00:20:56,293 --> 00:20:57,726
Haven't given up on me yet?

231
00:20:58,373 --> 00:20:59,806
Never.

232
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:49,649
Alfred still keeps the condensed milk
on the top shelf.

233
00:21:50,493 --> 00:21:52,324
Hasn't he noticed
you're tall enough to reach now?

234
00:21:52,324 --> 00:21:53,721
Old habits die hard, l guess.

235
00:21:54,093 --> 00:21:56,561
-Never used to stop us anyway.
-No, it didn't.

236
00:21:56,561 --> 00:21:58,530
How's your mom?

237
00:21:58,933 --> 00:22:01,083
She misses this place.

238
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:03,966
So do l.

239
00:22:04,373 --> 00:22:05,567
Yeah.

240
00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:08,611
But it's nothing without the people
who made it what it was.

241
00:22:08,611 --> 00:22:11,651
-Now there's only Alfred.
-And you.

242
00:22:11,651 --> 00:22:15,203
-l'm not staying, Rachel.
-You're just back for the hearing.

243
00:22:18,693 --> 00:22:22,686
Bruce, l don't suppose there's any way
to convince you not to come.

244
00:22:23,013 --> 00:22:26,369
Someone at this proceeding...

245
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,083
...should stand for my parents.

246
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,289
We all loved your parents, Bruce.

247
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:34,525
-What Chill did is unforgivable.
-Then why is your boss letting him go?

248
00:22:35,853 --> 00:22:38,970
ln prison, he shared a cell
with Carmine Falcone.

249
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:42,648
He learned things, and he will testify
in exchange for early parole.

250
00:22:42,648 --> 00:22:45,373
Rachel, this man killed my parents.

251
00:22:47,293 --> 00:22:48,931
l cannot let that pass.

252
00:22:48,931 --> 00:22:51,846
And l need you
to understand that, please.

253
00:22:53,533 --> 00:22:54,682
Okay.

254
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:58,930
The depression hit working people,
like Mr. Chill, hardest of all.

255
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:02,165
His crime was appalling, yes,
but it was motivated not by greed...

256
00:23:02,493 --> 00:23:04,085
...but by desperation.

257
00:23:04,085 --> 00:23:08,007
Given the 14 years served, as well as
his extraordinary level of cooperation...

258
00:23:08,007 --> 00:23:10,687
...with one of this office's
most important investigations...

259
00:23:10,687 --> 00:23:13,845
...we strongly endorse his petition
for early release.

260
00:23:14,813 --> 00:23:17,008
Mr. Chill?

261
00:23:20,453 --> 00:23:22,045
Your Honor...

262
00:23:22,893 --> 00:23:25,885
...not a day goes by that l don't wish
l could take back what l did.

263
00:23:28,413 --> 00:23:31,530
Sure, l was desperate,
like a lot of people back then...

264
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,923
...but that don't change what l did.

265
00:23:37,413 --> 00:23:41,884
l gather there is a member
of the Wayne family here today.

266
00:23:41,884 --> 00:23:44,248
Has he got anything to say?

267
00:23:58,373 --> 00:24:01,092
-He's coming out the side!
-He's coming out the side, guys!

268
00:24:10,373 --> 00:24:11,601
Bruce Wayne!

269
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:15,482
Joe! Hey, Joe!

270
00:24:15,482 --> 00:24:17,086
Falcone says hi.

271
00:24:27,013 --> 00:24:30,449
Come on, Bruce.
We don't need to see this.

272
00:24:31,173 --> 00:24:32,652
l do.

273
00:24:37,573 --> 00:24:39,484
The DA couldn't understand
why Judge Faden...

274
00:24:39,484 --> 00:24:41,405
...insisted on making the hearing public.

275
00:24:41,405 --> 00:24:43,882
Falcone paid him off
to get Chill out in the open.

276
00:24:44,093 --> 00:24:45,287
Maybe l should thank them.

277
00:24:45,287 --> 00:24:47,921
-You don't mean that.
-What if l do, Rachel?

278
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:49,924
My parents deserved justice.

279
00:24:49,924 --> 00:24:52,891
You're not talking about justice.
You're talking about revenge.

280
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,806
-Sometimes, they're the same.
-No, they're never the same.

281
00:24:55,806 --> 00:24:59,409
Justice is about harmony. Revenge is
about you making yourself feel better.

282
00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:02,724
-lt's why we have an impartial system.
-Your system is broken.

283
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:12,252
You care about justice?
Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.

284
00:25:12,653 --> 00:25:14,052
This city is rotting.

285
00:25:14,052 --> 00:25:16,886
They talk about the depression
as if it's history. lt's not.

286
00:25:16,886 --> 00:25:18,486
Things are worse than ever here.

287
00:25:18,486 --> 00:25:21,087
Falcone floods our streets
with crime and drugs...

288
00:25:21,087 --> 00:25:24,086
...preying on the desperate,
creating new Joe Chills every day.

289
00:25:24,086 --> 00:25:26,687
Falcone may not have killed
your parents, Bruce...

290
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:29,682
...but he's destroying everything
that they stood for.

291
00:25:34,053 --> 00:25:36,806
You wanna thank him for that?
Here you go.

292
00:25:38,613 --> 00:25:41,525
We all know where to find him.
As long as he keeps the bad people rich...

293
00:25:41,525 --> 00:25:43,684
...and the good people scared,
no one'll touch him.

294
00:25:43,684 --> 00:25:47,971
Good people like your parents, who'll
stand against injustice, they're gone.

295
00:25:47,971 --> 00:25:51,682
What chance does Gotham have
when the good people do nothing?

296
00:25:52,533 --> 00:25:55,809
-l'm not one of your good people, Rachel.
-What do you mean?

297
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,885
All these years, l wanted to kill him.

298
00:26:01,653 --> 00:26:03,166
Now l can't.

299
00:26:18,413 --> 00:26:20,051
Your father would be ashamed of you.

300
00:27:01,733 --> 00:27:04,122
You're taller than you look
in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne.

301
00:27:04,573 --> 00:27:06,370
No gun? l'm insulted.

302
00:27:09,413 --> 00:27:13,042
-You could've just sent a thank-you note.
-l didn't come here to thank you.

303
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:15,852
l came to show you that
not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you.

304
00:27:15,852 --> 00:27:17,571
Only those who know me, kid.

305
00:27:17,893 --> 00:27:20,282
Look around you.
You'll see two councilmen...

306
00:27:20,613 --> 00:27:23,332
...a union official,
couple off-duty cops...

307
00:27:23,733 --> 00:27:25,291
...and a judge.

308
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:29,571
l wouldn't have a second's hesitation of
blowing your head off in front of them.

309
00:27:29,571 --> 00:27:32,327
Now, that's power you can't buy.

310
00:27:32,933 --> 00:27:34,332
That's the power of fear.

311
00:27:34,733 --> 00:27:35,927
l'm not afraid of you.

312
00:27:35,927 --> 00:27:37,924
Because you think you got
nothing to lose.

313
00:27:37,924 --> 00:27:39,685
But you haven't thought it through.

314
00:27:39,685 --> 00:27:42,811
You haven't thought about
your lady friend in the DA's office.

315
00:27:42,811 --> 00:27:45,282
You haven't thought about
your old butler.

316
00:27:49,253 --> 00:27:51,483
People from your world...

317
00:27:51,483 --> 00:27:53,928
...have so much to lose.

318
00:27:53,928 --> 00:27:58,245
Now, you think because your mommy
and your daddy got shot...

319
00:27:58,245 --> 00:28:01,246
...you know about the ugly side of life,
but you don't.

320
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,449
You've never tasted desperate.

321
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:06,047
You're.... You're Bruce Wayne,
the prince of Gotham.

322
00:28:06,047 --> 00:28:09,489
You'd have to go 1000 miles to meet
someone who didn't know your name.

323
00:28:09,489 --> 00:28:13,771
So don't come here with your anger,
trying to prove something to yourself.

324
00:28:13,771 --> 00:28:15,969
This is a world
you'll never understand.

325
00:28:15,969 --> 00:28:18,044
And you always fear...

326
00:28:18,044 --> 00:28:20,568
...what you don't understand.

327
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:24,652
All right.

328
00:28:31,973 --> 00:28:34,692
Yeah, you got spirit, kid.
l'll give you that.

329
00:28:34,692 --> 00:28:36,764
More than your old man anyway.

330
00:28:36,764 --> 00:28:41,051
ln the joint, Chill told me about
the night he killed your parents.

331
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:43,329
He said your father begged for mercy.

332
00:28:44,653 --> 00:28:46,325
Begged.

333
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:47,812
Like a dog.

334
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:01,851
Should've tipped better.

335
00:29:11,453 --> 00:29:13,205
-For what?
-Your jacket.

336
00:29:13,733 --> 00:29:15,291
Okay.

337
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:19,643
Hey, hey, hey. Let me have it.
lt's a nice coat.

338
00:29:19,643 --> 00:29:21,849
Be careful who sees you with that.

339
00:29:22,413 --> 00:29:24,244
-They're gonna come looking for me.
-Who?

340
00:29:24,693 --> 00:29:26,331
Everyone.

341
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,205
lt's....

342
00:29:30,205 --> 00:29:32,284
lt's a nice coat.

343
00:29:49,853 --> 00:29:54,051
When you lived among the criminals,
did you start to pity them?

344
00:29:54,051 --> 00:29:57,728
The first time I stole
so that I wouldn 't starve, yes.

345
00:29:57,933 --> 00:30:03,166
I lost many assumptions about
the simple nature of right and wrong.

346
00:30:04,413 --> 00:30:06,404
And when I traveled...

347
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:09,167
...I learned the fear before a crime...

348
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:12,361
...and the thrill of success.

349
00:30:14,173 --> 00:30:15,970
But I never became one of them.

350
00:30:19,293 --> 00:30:22,091
Fool. What do l care what your name is?
You're a criminal.

351
00:30:23,493 --> 00:30:25,211
Tell that to the guy who owned these.

352
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:32,081
You've traveled the world to understand
the criminal mind and conquer your fears.

353
00:30:34,093 --> 00:30:38,052
But a criminal is not complicated.

354
00:30:38,052 --> 00:30:41,410
And what you really fear
is inside yourself.

355
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:44,007
You fear your own power.

356
00:30:44,007 --> 00:30:45,401
You fear your anger...

357
00:30:45,853 --> 00:30:49,926
...the drive to do great
or terrible things.

358
00:30:49,926 --> 00:30:53,403
Now you must journey inwards.

359
00:30:57,013 --> 00:30:59,004
You are ready.

360
00:30:59,973 --> 00:31:01,326
Breathe.

361
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,290
Breathe.

362
00:31:17,093 --> 00:31:18,845
Breathe in your fears.

363
00:31:21,373 --> 00:31:22,362
Face them.

364
00:31:23,813 --> 00:31:26,486
To conquer fear,
you must become fear.

365
00:31:26,486 --> 00:31:29,884
You must bask in the fear
of other men.

366
00:31:31,293 --> 00:31:34,569
And men fear most
what they cannot see.

367
00:31:51,093 --> 00:31:53,846
You have to become a terrible thought.

368
00:31:58,213 --> 00:31:59,362
A wraith.

369
00:32:04,853 --> 00:32:07,128
You have to become an idea!

370
00:32:13,733 --> 00:32:16,645
Feel terror cloud your senses.

371
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:21,405
Feel its power to distort.

372
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:24,449
To control.

373
00:32:27,413 --> 00:32:31,042
And know that this power
can be yours.

374
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:45,653
Embrace your worst fear.

375
00:32:52,373 --> 00:32:54,568
Become one with the darkness.

376
00:33:13,573 --> 00:33:15,211
Focus.

377
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,563
Concentrate.

378
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:19,769
Master your senses.

379
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:49,048
You cannot leave any sign.

380
00:33:49,413 --> 00:33:50,562
l haven't.

381
00:33:58,533 --> 00:34:00,444
lmpressive.

382
00:34:09,533 --> 00:34:11,171
We have purged your fear.

383
00:34:12,293 --> 00:34:13,851
You are ready to lead these men.

384
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:17,403
You are ready to become a member
of the League of Shadows.

385
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:23,926
But first, you must demonstrate
your commitment to justice.

386
00:34:39,973 --> 00:34:41,292
No.

387
00:34:42,693 --> 00:34:43,921
l'm no executioner.

388
00:34:44,453 --> 00:34:47,968
Your compassion is a weakness
your enemies will not share.

389
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:50,528
That's why it's so important.

390
00:34:50,773 --> 00:34:52,445
lt separates us from them.

391
00:34:52,445 --> 00:34:54,888
You want to fight criminals.
This man is a murderer.

392
00:34:54,888 --> 00:34:56,771
-This man should be tried.
-By whom?

393
00:34:56,771 --> 00:34:58,571
Corrupt bureaucrats?

394
00:34:58,571 --> 00:35:01,122
Criminals mock society's laws.

395
00:35:01,122 --> 00:35:03,488
You know this better than most.

396
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:06,847
You cannot lead these men...

397
00:35:06,847 --> 00:35:10,847
...unless you are prepared to do
what is necessary to defeat evil.

398
00:35:11,413 --> 00:35:13,722
And where would l be leading
these men?

399
00:35:14,253 --> 00:35:15,481
Gotham.

400
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:17,609
As Gotham's favored son...

401
00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:21,925
...you will be ideally placed
to strike at the heart of criminality.

402
00:35:22,293 --> 00:35:25,888
-How?
-Gotham's time has come.

403
00:35:25,888 --> 00:35:29,250
Like Constantinople
or Rome before it...

404
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:33,452
...the city has become a breeding ground
for suffering and injustice.

405
00:35:33,452 --> 00:35:37,083
lt is beyond saving
and must be allowed to die.

406
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:42,202
This is the most important function
of the League of Shadows.

407
00:35:42,493 --> 00:35:45,451
lt is one we've performed
for centuries.

408
00:35:45,773 --> 00:35:47,445
Gotham...

409
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:50,366
...must be destroyed.

410
00:35:53,573 --> 00:35:55,006
You can't believe in this.

411
00:35:55,213 --> 00:35:59,570
Ra's al Ghul rescued us from
the darkest corners of our own hearts.

412
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:03,965
What he asks in return is the courage
to do what is necessary.

413
00:36:04,173 --> 00:36:07,370
l will go back to Gotham
and l will fight men like this...

414
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:10,001
...but l will not
become an executioner.

415
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,652
Bruce, please.

416
00:36:11,652 --> 00:36:14,532
For your own sake,
there is no turning back.

417
00:36:45,573 --> 00:36:48,007
-What are you doing?
-What's necessary, my friend.

418
00:38:58,853 --> 00:39:01,845
l will tell him you saved his life.

419
00:39:19,813 --> 00:39:22,247
Master Wayne,
you've been gone a long time.

420
00:39:22,247 --> 00:39:24,608
-Yes, l have.
-You look very fashionable.

421
00:39:26,053 --> 00:39:27,486
Apart from the mud.

422
00:39:27,733 --> 00:39:30,293
Are you coming back to Gotham
for long, sir?

423
00:39:30,293 --> 00:39:31,647
As long as it takes.

424
00:39:31,647 --> 00:39:33,246
l want to show the people...

425
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:36,689
...their city doesn't belong
to the criminals and the corrupt.

426
00:39:36,689 --> 00:39:39,925
ln the depression, your father nearly
bankrupted Wayne Enterprises...

427
00:39:39,925 --> 00:39:41,242
...combating poverty.

428
00:39:41,453 --> 00:39:45,765
He believed his example could inspire
the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.

429
00:39:46,053 --> 00:39:47,611
Did it?

430
00:39:48,693 --> 00:39:50,092
ln a way.

431
00:39:50,092 --> 00:39:53,211
Their murder shocked the wealthy
and the powerful into action.

432
00:39:55,133 --> 00:39:58,045
People need dramatic examples
to shake them out of apathy.

433
00:39:58,045 --> 00:39:59,805
l can't do that as Bruce Wayne.

434
00:39:59,805 --> 00:40:01,452
As a man...

435
00:40:01,452 --> 00:40:03,922
...l'm flesh and blood,
l can be ignored, destroyed.

436
00:40:03,922 --> 00:40:05,924
But as a symbol....

437
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:09,893
As a symbol, l can be incorruptible.

438
00:40:09,893 --> 00:40:12,567
-l can be everlasting.
-What symbol?

439
00:40:13,133 --> 00:40:15,693
Something elemental...

440
00:40:15,693 --> 00:40:17,411
...something terrifying.

441
00:40:17,411 --> 00:40:19,609
l assume that as you take on
the underworld...

442
00:40:19,609 --> 00:40:24,688
...this symbol is a persona to protect
those you care about from reprisals?

443
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:26,172
You're thinking about Rachel?

444
00:40:26,172 --> 00:40:28,608
Actually, sir, l was thinking of myself.

445
00:40:30,533 --> 00:40:32,205
Have you told anyone
l'm coming back?

446
00:40:32,413 --> 00:40:36,452
l couldn't figure the legal ramifications
of bringing you back from the dead.

447
00:40:36,452 --> 00:40:38,410
-Dead?
-You've been gone seven years.

448
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:39,801
You had me declared dead?

449
00:40:39,801 --> 00:40:42,726
Actually, it was Mr. Earle.
He's taking the company public.

450
00:40:42,726 --> 00:40:45,043
He wanted to liquidate
your majority shareholding.

451
00:40:45,253 --> 00:40:47,483
Those shares are worth
quite a bit of money.

452
00:40:47,483 --> 00:40:50,247
Well, it's a good thing
l left everything to you, then.

453
00:40:50,773 --> 00:40:52,331
Quite so, sir.

454
00:40:52,331 --> 00:40:56,088
And you can borrow the Rolls, if you like.
Just bring it back with a full tank.

455
00:41:05,733 --> 00:41:10,249
ln my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much
a danger to himself as to others...

456
00:41:10,613 --> 00:41:15,004
...and prison is probably not the best
environment for his rehabilitation.

457
00:41:17,213 --> 00:41:19,681
-Dr. Crane.
-Miss Dawes.

458
00:41:19,681 --> 00:41:23,004
You think a man who butchers people
for the mob doesn't belong in jail?

459
00:41:23,004 --> 00:41:25,733
l would hardly have testified to that
otherwise, would l?

460
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,851
This is the third of Falcone's thugs
you've had declared insane...

461
00:41:28,851 --> 00:41:30,366
...and moved into your asylum.

462
00:41:30,573 --> 00:41:35,010
The work offered by organized crime
must have an attraction to the insane.

463
00:41:36,493 --> 00:41:38,404
Or the corrupt.

464
00:41:40,573 --> 00:41:42,086
Mr. Finch.

465
00:41:42,413 --> 00:41:44,131
You should check
with Miss Dawes here...

466
00:41:44,131 --> 00:41:48,491
...just what implications your office
has authorized her to make. lf any.

467
00:41:52,293 --> 00:41:54,523
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing, Carl?

468
00:41:54,523 --> 00:41:56,012
Looking out for you.

469
00:41:58,413 --> 00:42:01,211
Falcone has half the city
bought and paid for.

470
00:42:01,211 --> 00:42:03,329
-Drop it.
-How can you say that?

471
00:42:03,329 --> 00:42:07,042
Because as much as l care about
getting Falcone, l care more about you.

472
00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:08,441
That's sweet.

473
00:42:13,653 --> 00:42:15,928
We've been through all that.

474
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,332
Blessed bat again, sir.

475
00:42:42,773 --> 00:42:45,082
They nest somewhere in the grounds.

476
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:40,727
No more favors.
Someone is sniffing around.

477
00:44:40,727 --> 00:44:43,726
Hey, l scratch your back,
you scratch mine, doc.

478
00:44:43,726 --> 00:44:45,212
l'm bringing in the shipments.

479
00:44:45,893 --> 00:44:47,042
We are paying you for that.

480
00:44:47,042 --> 00:44:49,602
Maybe money isn't as interesting
to me as favors.

481
00:44:52,013 --> 00:44:56,609
l am more than aware that you are
not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.

482
00:44:56,609 --> 00:44:59,731
But you know who l'm working for,
and when he gets here--

483
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:01,724
He-- He's coming to Gotham?

484
00:45:01,724 --> 00:45:03,292
Yes, he is.

485
00:45:03,292 --> 00:45:05,808
And when he gets here,
he's not going to wanna hear...

486
00:45:05,808 --> 00:45:10,842
...that you've endangered our operation
just to get your thugs out of jail time.

487
00:45:11,813 --> 00:45:15,010
-Who's bothering you?
-There's a girl at the DA's office.

488
00:45:15,493 --> 00:45:17,211
-We'll buy her off.
-Not this one.

489
00:45:18,293 --> 00:45:20,124
ldealist, huh?

490
00:45:20,124 --> 00:45:21,931
Well, there's an answer to that too.

491
00:45:22,293 --> 00:45:25,126
-l don't want to know.
-Yes, you do.

492
00:45:29,133 --> 00:45:32,443
No, we are showing very healthy growth
in these sectors.

493
00:45:32,443 --> 00:45:35,650
l don't think Thomas Wayne would have
viewed heavy-arms manufacture...

494
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,883
...as a suitable cornerstone
for our business.

495
00:45:39,213 --> 00:45:42,842
Well, that's 20 years ago, Fredericks.

496
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:46,210
l think after 20 years
we can allow ourselves...

497
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:49,092
...to stop thinking about what
Thomas Wayne would have done.

498
00:45:49,092 --> 00:45:51,050
Good morning, Mr. Earle's office.

499
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:54,364
Yes, he's confirmed for
the dinner tomorrow evening.

500
00:45:54,364 --> 00:45:57,730
Good morning.
l'm here to see Mr. Earle.

501
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:59,326
Name?

502
00:45:59,773 --> 00:46:01,365
Bruce Wayne.

503
00:46:03,173 --> 00:46:06,529
Thomas would probably not
have taken the company public.

504
00:46:06,529 --> 00:46:10,606
But that is what we,
as responsible managers, are going to do.

505
00:46:11,293 --> 00:46:12,772
Jessica?

506
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:16,247
Jessica? Where are you?

507
00:46:16,247 --> 00:46:20,486
-Eye on the ball, and....
-Why is no one answering the phone?

508
00:46:21,133 --> 00:46:24,170
lt's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle.
l'm sure they'll call back.

509
00:46:24,493 --> 00:46:26,882
Bruce? You're supposed to be dead.

510
00:46:26,882 --> 00:46:28,930
l'm sorry to disappoint.

511
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:31,687
-l need you to take a look at this.
-Have you seen him yet?

512
00:46:31,973 --> 00:46:33,452
-Who?
-Wayne.

513
00:46:33,773 --> 00:46:35,764
lt's been all over the news.
He's back.

514
00:46:39,533 --> 00:46:42,331
l'm sure you realize
l can't stop the big machine.

515
00:46:42,331 --> 00:46:43,687
Too many wheels turning.

516
00:46:43,687 --> 00:46:45,764
-We're going public.
-l understand.

517
00:46:46,213 --> 00:46:48,932
And l'll be handsomely rewarded
for my shares.

518
00:46:48,932 --> 00:46:51,527
l'm not looking to interfere.

519
00:46:51,973 --> 00:46:54,009
-l am looking for a job.
-Oh?

520
00:46:54,009 --> 00:46:57,085
l just want to get to know the company
that my family built.

521
00:46:57,413 --> 00:46:59,085
Any ideas where you would start?

522
00:46:59,573 --> 00:47:01,848
Applied Sciences caught my eye.

523
00:47:02,213 --> 00:47:03,851
Fox's department.

524
00:47:03,851 --> 00:47:05,924
l'll let him know you're coming.

525
00:47:06,813 --> 00:47:09,452
You look like him. Your dad.

526
00:47:10,213 --> 00:47:12,773
You're the only one left
of the Wayne family.

527
00:47:12,773 --> 00:47:16,721
This is where you belong.
Welcome home.

528
00:47:17,053 --> 00:47:21,365
Environmental procedures,
defense projects, consumer products.

529
00:47:21,853 --> 00:47:24,447
All prototypes. None in production.

530
00:47:24,447 --> 00:47:27,173
-On any level whatsoever.
-None?

531
00:47:28,133 --> 00:47:29,885
What did they tell you this place was?

532
00:47:29,885 --> 00:47:32,009
They didn't tell me anything.

533
00:47:34,373 --> 00:47:37,683
Earle told me exactly what it was
when he sent me down here.

534
00:47:38,133 --> 00:47:39,532
Dead end.

535
00:47:39,532 --> 00:47:42,890
Place to keep me from causing
the board any more trouble.

536
00:47:43,813 --> 00:47:45,246
Come on.

537
00:47:45,246 --> 00:47:47,768
-You were on the board?
-When your father ran things.

538
00:47:47,768 --> 00:47:49,730
-You knew my father?
-Oh, yeah.

539
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:51,485
Helped him build his train.

540
00:47:52,053 --> 00:47:53,611
Here we are.

541
00:47:57,133 --> 00:47:58,691
Kevlar utility harness.

542
00:47:59,053 --> 00:48:00,930
Gas-powered, magnetic grapple gun.

543
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:03,323
The 350-pound test monofilament.

544
00:48:06,533 --> 00:48:08,603
Wonderful project, your dad's train.

545
00:48:09,093 --> 00:48:13,530
Routed it right into Wayne Tower,
along with the water and power utilities.

546
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:16,765
Kind of made Wayne Tower
the unofficial center of Gotham City.

547
00:48:16,973 --> 00:48:19,487
Of course, Earle let it go to rot.
Here we are.

548
00:48:21,293 --> 00:48:23,329
Nomex survival suit
for advanced infantry.

549
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:26,172
Kevlar biweave, reinforced joints.

550
00:48:26,493 --> 00:48:28,768
-Tear-resistant?
-This sucker will stop a knife.

551
00:48:28,768 --> 00:48:31,049
-Bulletproof?
-Anything but a straight shot.

552
00:48:31,049 --> 00:48:33,966
-Why didn't they put it into production?
-Bean counters didn't think...

553
00:48:33,966 --> 00:48:36,408
...a soldier's life was worth 300 grand.

554
00:48:37,453 --> 00:48:40,763
So, what's your interest in it,
Mr. Wayne?

555
00:48:41,413 --> 00:48:42,846
l want to borrow it.

556
00:48:42,846 --> 00:48:44,731
For spelunking.

557
00:48:45,573 --> 00:48:46,801
Spelunking?

558
00:48:46,801 --> 00:48:48,611
Yeah, you know, cave diving?

559
00:48:49,853 --> 00:48:52,413
You expecting to run into
much gunfire in these caves?

560
00:48:54,653 --> 00:48:57,770
Look, l'd rather Mr. Earle
didn't know about me borrowing--

561
00:48:57,770 --> 00:48:59,127
Mr. Wayne...

562
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:01,164
...the way l see it...

563
00:49:01,613 --> 00:49:03,968
...all this stuff is yours anyway.

564
00:49:06,813 --> 00:49:09,202
Okay. Give it a try.

565
00:49:13,173 --> 00:49:14,367
Charming.

566
00:49:17,093 --> 00:49:18,811
At least you'll have company.

567
00:49:20,613 --> 00:49:24,447
This must be the lowest foundation
of the southeast wing.

568
00:49:36,413 --> 00:49:40,406
Your great-great-grandfather was
involved in the Underground Railroad...

569
00:49:40,406 --> 00:49:43,451
...secretly transporting freed slaves
to the North...

570
00:49:43,451 --> 00:49:47,162
...and l suspect these caverns
came in handy.

571
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:01,403
Alfred! Come up here!

572
00:50:01,613 --> 00:50:04,446
l can see everything all right
from down here, sir, thank you.

573
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:26,213
We order the main part
of this cowl from Singapore.

574
00:50:26,213 --> 00:50:27,806
Via a dummy corporation.

575
00:50:27,806 --> 00:50:29,725
lndeed. And then, quite separately...

576
00:50:29,725 --> 00:50:34,648
...we place an order
to a Chinese company for these.

577
00:50:35,173 --> 00:50:38,006
-Put it together ourselves.
-Precisely.

578
00:50:38,006 --> 00:50:42,052
They'll have to be large orders,
to avoid suspicion.

579
00:50:42,052 --> 00:50:44,647
-How large?
-Say 10,000.

580
00:50:47,053 --> 00:50:49,851
-Well, at least we'll have spares.
-Yes.

581
00:51:06,253 --> 00:51:08,244
Don't suppose you want a taste.

582
00:51:08,244 --> 00:51:11,450
l just keep offering,
thinking maybe someday you'll get wise.

583
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:13,683
There's nothing wise
in what you do, Flass.

584
00:51:13,683 --> 00:51:17,084
Well, Jimbo, you don't take the taste,
makes us guys nervous.

585
00:51:17,084 --> 00:51:19,005
l'm no rat.

586
00:51:21,653 --> 00:51:25,202
ln a town this bent,
who's there to rat to anyway?

587
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:55,729
Don't turn around.

588
00:51:56,293 --> 00:51:59,251
You're a good cop.
One of the few.

589
00:51:59,893 --> 00:52:00,962
What do you want?

590
00:52:00,962 --> 00:52:04,170
Carmine Falcone brings in
shipments of drugs every week.

591
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:06,051
Nobody takes him down. Why?

592
00:52:07,413 --> 00:52:09,449
He's paid up with the right people.

593
00:52:09,733 --> 00:52:12,406
What will it take to bring him down?

594
00:52:13,093 --> 00:52:15,402
Leverage on Judge Faden...

595
00:52:16,093 --> 00:52:18,368
...and a DA brave enough
to prosecute.

596
00:52:18,773 --> 00:52:20,331
Rachel Dawes.

597
00:52:20,893 --> 00:52:21,962
Who are you?

598
00:52:22,373 --> 00:52:23,931
Watch for my sign.

599
00:52:26,493 --> 00:52:28,449
You're just one man?

600
00:52:28,853 --> 00:52:30,206
Now we're two.

601
00:52:32,253 --> 00:52:33,003
We?

602
00:52:48,773 --> 00:52:50,445
Freeze!

603
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:08,764
What the hell was that?

604
00:53:11,573 --> 00:53:12,722
Just some nut.

605
00:53:16,013 --> 00:53:18,686
Well, what is it today?
More spelunking?

606
00:53:18,686 --> 00:53:21,242
No. Today it's BASE-jumping.

607
00:53:21,813 --> 00:53:23,371
BASE-jumping.

608
00:53:23,933 --> 00:53:26,367
-That like parachuting?
-Kind of.

609
00:53:27,533 --> 00:53:30,206
Do you have any lightweight fabrics?

610
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:32,933
You know,
l think l have just the thing.

611
00:53:34,213 --> 00:53:36,568
lt's called memory cloth.
Notice anything?

612
00:53:39,773 --> 00:53:41,570
Regularly flexible...

613
00:53:41,973 --> 00:53:44,009
...but put a current through it...

614
00:53:45,413 --> 00:53:48,962
-...molecules realign, it becomes rigid.
-What kind of shapes can you make?

615
00:53:48,962 --> 00:53:52,125
Can be tailored to fit any structure
based on a rigid skeleton.

616
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:53,442
Too expensive for the Army?

617
00:53:53,442 --> 00:53:58,164
l don't think they tried to market it
to the billionaire, BASE-jumping crowd.

618
00:53:58,164 --> 00:54:00,051
-Look, Mr. Fox.
-Yes, sir?

619
00:54:00,693 --> 00:54:02,012
lf you're uncomfortable--

620
00:54:02,012 --> 00:54:05,245
Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me
exactly what you're doing...

621
00:54:05,245 --> 00:54:07,290
...when l'm asked, l don't have to lie.

622
00:54:08,973 --> 00:54:11,441
But don't think of me as an idiot.

623
00:54:12,893 --> 00:54:14,770
Fair enough.

624
00:54:16,613 --> 00:54:18,365
What's that?

625
00:54:20,373 --> 00:54:22,204
The Tumbler?

626
00:54:22,693 --> 00:54:24,570
Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that.

627
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:32,164
She was built as a bridging vehicle.

628
00:54:34,093 --> 00:54:38,325
During combat, two of these
would jump over a river, towing cables.

629
00:54:40,773 --> 00:54:44,243
Over here on the throttle,
flip that open and throttle up.

630
00:54:44,453 --> 00:54:46,887
This will boost you into a rampless jump--
Not now!

631
00:54:49,613 --> 00:54:51,649
Not-- Not now, sir.

632
00:54:54,373 --> 00:54:56,170
Afterburner disengaged.

633
00:54:56,533 --> 00:54:59,445
We never could get
the damn bridge to work...

634
00:54:59,445 --> 00:55:01,251
...but this baby works just fine.

635
00:55:10,413 --> 00:55:11,607
So, what do you think?

636
00:55:12,813 --> 00:55:14,724
Does it come in black?

637
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:17,608
l need you at the docks Thursday.

638
00:55:17,853 --> 00:55:19,650
-Problems?
-l don't want any trouble...

639
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,849
-...with the last shipment.
-Sure.

640
00:55:23,373 --> 00:55:26,888
Word on the street is you got a beef
with somebody in the DA's office.

641
00:55:26,888 --> 00:55:29,362
-ls that right?
-And that there's a fat prize...

642
00:55:29,362 --> 00:55:32,127
...waiting for anybody willing
to do anything about it.

643
00:55:32,127 --> 00:55:34,170
So, what's your point, Mr. Flass?

644
00:55:34,613 --> 00:55:35,807
Have you seen the girl?

645
00:55:36,293 --> 00:55:38,853
It's a cute little assistant D A.

646
00:55:38,853 --> 00:55:42,528
Don 't you think that's a little too much
heat to bring down, maybe?

647
00:55:42,528 --> 00:55:45,890
-Even for this town.
-Never underestimate Gotham City.

648
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:48,772
People get mugged coming home
from work every day of the week.

649
00:55:48,772 --> 00:55:51,447
Sometimes--
Sometimes things just go bad.

650
00:55:55,173 --> 00:55:56,891
lt's a problem with the graphite, sir.

651
00:55:57,093 --> 00:55:59,653
The next 10,000
will be up to specifications.

652
00:55:59,653 --> 00:56:02,281
-At least they gave us a discount.
-Quite.

653
00:56:02,281 --> 00:56:07,846
ln the meantime, sir, may l suggest
you try to avoid landing on your head?

654
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:45,289
Why bats, Master Wayne?

655
00:56:45,533 --> 00:56:46,727
Bats frighten me.

656
00:56:47,973 --> 00:56:50,168
lt's time my enemies shared my dread.

657
00:57:15,773 --> 00:57:17,604
What is this?

658
00:57:21,253 --> 00:57:22,527
Continue.

659
00:57:27,813 --> 00:57:29,405
Looks fine out there.

660
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:31,644
The bears go straight to the dealers.

661
00:57:31,644 --> 00:57:34,373
Yeah, and the rabbits go
to the man in the Narrows.

662
00:57:34,373 --> 00:57:37,411
-What's the difference?
-lgnorance is bliss, my friend.

663
00:57:37,411 --> 00:57:40,610
Don't burden yourself
with the secrets of scary people.

664
00:57:55,813 --> 00:57:58,691
Hey. Steiss.

665
00:58:19,133 --> 00:58:20,532
Steiss?

666
00:58:31,973 --> 00:58:33,531
What?

667
00:58:34,253 --> 00:58:35,652
What the...?

668
00:58:44,293 --> 00:58:46,045
l better check it.

669
00:58:58,093 --> 00:59:00,004
There's a problem out here.
You better bail.

670
00:59:28,133 --> 00:59:29,691
Where are you?!

671
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:30,842
Here.

672
00:59:51,053 --> 00:59:54,204
Get going. Oh, shit.

673
01:00:11,653 --> 01:00:13,689
What the hell are you?

674
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:17,728
l'm Batman.

675
01:00:25,733 --> 01:00:27,610
Nice coat.

676
01:00:29,253 --> 01:00:30,732
Thanks.

677
01:01:10,093 --> 01:01:11,287
Hold it.

678
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:15,688
That's right, you better run.

679
01:01:24,293 --> 01:01:26,045
Falcone sent them to kill you.

680
01:01:27,133 --> 01:01:29,601
-Why?
-You rattled his cage.

681
01:01:33,253 --> 01:01:34,732
-What's this?
-Leverage.

682
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:36,451
-For what?
-To get things moving.

683
01:01:36,733 --> 01:01:38,644
Who are you?

684
01:01:39,013 --> 01:01:40,207
Someone like you.

685
01:01:40,207 --> 01:01:42,329
Someone who'll rattle the cages.

686
01:01:47,213 --> 01:01:50,569
Ma'am? Everything okay?

687
01:01:54,693 --> 01:01:57,082
-Falcone's men?
-Does it matter?

688
01:01:57,082 --> 01:01:59,448
We'll never tie him to it anyway.

689
01:01:59,653 --> 01:02:01,689
l wouldn't be too sure of that.

690
01:02:14,213 --> 01:02:15,965
What the hell is that?

691
01:02:25,173 --> 01:02:26,367
Cut him down.

692
01:02:48,053 --> 01:02:49,247
Unacceptable.

693
01:02:49,247 --> 01:02:52,132
Now, l don't care if it's rival gangs,
Guardian Angels...

694
01:02:52,132 --> 01:02:54,170
...or the goddamn Salvation Army...

695
01:02:54,413 --> 01:02:56,643
...get them off the street
and off the front page.

696
01:02:56,643 --> 01:02:59,281
They say it was just one guy.
Or a creature.

697
01:02:59,281 --> 01:03:02,047
lt was some asshole in a costume.

698
01:03:02,533 --> 01:03:04,125
-Yeah?
-This guy did deliver us...

699
01:03:04,125 --> 01:03:06,966
...one of the city's biggest crime lords.

700
01:03:06,966 --> 01:03:10,489
No one takes the law
into their own hands in my city.

701
01:03:10,489 --> 01:03:11,802
Understand?

702
01:03:12,093 --> 01:03:14,448
-No way to bury it now.
-There's still Judge Faden.

703
01:03:14,448 --> 01:03:17,571
-l've got Faden covered.
-What about this bat they babble about?

704
01:03:17,571 --> 01:03:20,725
Even if these guys will swear
to being thrashed by a giant bat...

705
01:03:20,725 --> 01:03:22,963
...we've got Falcone at the scene.

706
01:03:22,963 --> 01:03:26,205
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests.
This bat character gave us everything.

707
01:03:26,613 --> 01:03:28,092
Okay. Let's do it.

708
01:03:31,373 --> 01:03:33,409
-Bats are nocturnal.
-Bats may be.

709
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:36,849
But even for billionaire playboys,
3:00 is pushing it.

710
01:03:37,853 --> 01:03:40,606
The price for leading a double life,
l fear.

711
01:03:41,893 --> 01:03:44,202
Your theatrics made an impression.

712
01:03:45,533 --> 01:03:48,445
Theatricality and deception...

713
01:03:48,445 --> 01:03:51,685
...are powerful weapons, Alfred.
This is a good start.

714
01:03:51,685 --> 01:03:54,526
lf those are to be the first
of many injuries to come...

715
01:03:54,526 --> 01:03:57,412
...it would be wise
to find a suitable excuse.

716
01:03:57,733 --> 01:03:59,007
Polo, for instance.

717
01:03:59,007 --> 01:04:00,765
l'm not learning polo, Alfred.

718
01:04:01,013 --> 01:04:04,528
Strange injuries,
a nonexistent social life.

719
01:04:04,528 --> 01:04:06,092
These things beg the question...

720
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:10,326
...as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne
do with his time and his money.

721
01:04:10,326 --> 01:04:12,006
What does someone like me do?

722
01:04:12,933 --> 01:04:16,972
Drive sports cars, date movie stars.

723
01:04:17,613 --> 01:04:19,126
Buy things that are not for sale.

724
01:04:19,126 --> 01:04:22,683
Who knows, Master Wayne,
you start pretending to have fun...

725
01:04:23,293 --> 01:04:25,204
...you might even have a little
by accident.

726
01:04:27,813 --> 01:04:29,212
Sir.

727
01:04:29,212 --> 01:04:31,603
-We have a situation.
-All right.

728
01:04:31,973 --> 01:04:35,648
The Coast Guard picked up
one of our cargo ships last night...

729
01:04:36,173 --> 01:04:40,769
...heavily damaged, all crew missing,
probably dead.

730
01:04:42,733 --> 01:04:45,008
The ship was carrying
a prototype weapon.

731
01:04:45,213 --> 01:04:46,931
It's a microwave emitter.

732
01:04:46,931 --> 01:04:49,926
lt's designed for desert warfare,
but it--

733
01:04:51,533 --> 01:04:53,046
lt looks like somebody...

734
01:04:57,253 --> 01:04:58,686
...turned it on.

735
01:05:02,693 --> 01:05:06,971
lt uses focused microwaves to
vaporize the enemy's water supply.

736
01:05:14,573 --> 01:05:17,406
The damage to the ship
was catastrophic.

737
01:05:17,406 --> 01:05:20,451
The weapon itself is....

738
01:05:21,693 --> 01:05:23,126
Missing?

739
01:05:23,933 --> 01:05:25,127
Yeah.

740
01:05:26,373 --> 01:05:28,250
Mr. Wayne.

741
01:05:31,813 --> 01:05:33,212
Nice car.

742
01:05:33,212 --> 01:05:34,692
You should see my other one.

743
01:05:44,293 --> 01:05:46,170
He's done something
the police never have.

744
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:48,528
You can't take the law
into your own hands.

745
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:51,161
Well, at least he's getting
something done.

746
01:05:51,161 --> 01:05:53,563
Bruce, help me out here.

747
01:05:53,563 --> 01:05:57,885
Well, a guy who dresses up
like a bat clearly has issues.

748
01:05:58,893 --> 01:06:01,043
But he's put Falcone behind bars.

749
01:06:01,043 --> 01:06:03,488
And now the cops want him.
What does that tell you?

750
01:06:03,488 --> 01:06:04,802
They're jealous.

751
01:06:04,802 --> 01:06:07,487
Sir, the pool is for decoration...

752
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:10,884
...and your friends
do not have swimwear.

753
01:06:12,613 --> 01:06:14,524
Well, they're European.

754
01:06:16,293 --> 01:06:18,568
l'm going to have to ask you to leave.

755
01:06:19,453 --> 01:06:22,763
-lt is not a question of money.
-Well, you see...

756
01:06:23,333 --> 01:06:25,051
...l'm buying this hotel...

757
01:06:26,773 --> 01:06:31,005
...and setting some new rules
about the pool area.

758
01:06:32,133 --> 01:06:34,408
l think the Batman deserves a medal.

759
01:06:34,408 --> 01:06:36,609
And a straitjacket to pin it on.

760
01:06:42,853 --> 01:06:44,366
Thank you.

761
01:06:46,053 --> 01:06:47,327
Bruce?

762
01:06:50,773 --> 01:06:52,491
Rachel?

763
01:06:52,491 --> 01:06:54,006
l'd heard you were back.

764
01:06:55,973 --> 01:06:57,406
What are you doing?

765
01:06:58,133 --> 01:07:02,365
Just swimming here.
Wow, it is good to see you.

766
01:07:02,365 --> 01:07:04,012
You were gone a long time.

767
01:07:04,573 --> 01:07:07,371
-l know. How are things?
-The same.

768
01:07:09,213 --> 01:07:10,805
Job's getting worse.

769
01:07:10,805 --> 01:07:13,567
Can't change the world on your own.

770
01:07:13,567 --> 01:07:15,724
What choice do l have...

771
01:07:16,373 --> 01:07:18,045
...when you're too busy swimming?

772
01:07:19,333 --> 01:07:21,289
Rachel, all of--

773
01:07:21,573 --> 01:07:23,165
All this....

774
01:07:24,533 --> 01:07:28,412
lt's-- lt's not me. lt's....

775
01:07:29,155 --> 01:07:31,669
lnside, l am....

776
01:07:32,835 --> 01:07:34,712
l am more.

777
01:07:35,355 --> 01:07:36,834
Come on, Bruce. Come on.

778
01:07:36,834 --> 01:07:40,624
Bruce, we have some more hotels
for you to buy.

779
01:07:41,635 --> 01:07:43,034
Bruce...

780
01:07:44,155 --> 01:07:47,511
...deep down you may still be
that same great kid you used to be.

781
01:07:49,835 --> 01:07:52,303
But it's not who you are underneath...

782
01:07:52,755 --> 01:07:54,427
...it's what you do that defines you.

783
01:08:06,475 --> 01:08:07,988
Dr. Crane, thanks for coming.

784
01:08:07,988 --> 01:08:10,908
Not at all. He cut his wrists?

785
01:08:10,908 --> 01:08:14,590
Probably looking for the insanity plea.
But if anything should happen....

786
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:17,588
Of course, better safe than sorry.

787
01:08:20,875 --> 01:08:24,311
Yeah, Dr. Crane, l can't take it anymore.
lt's all too much.

788
01:08:24,311 --> 01:08:26,830
The walls are closing in.
Blah, blah, blah.

789
01:08:27,355 --> 01:08:29,744
A couple of days of this food,
it'll be true.

790
01:08:30,715 --> 01:08:32,307
-What do you want?
-l wanna know...

791
01:08:32,307 --> 01:08:34,864
...how you're gonna convince me
to keep my mouth shut.

792
01:08:34,864 --> 01:08:37,105
About what?
You don't know anything.

793
01:08:37,105 --> 01:08:41,268
l know you don't want the cops to take
a closer look at the drugs they seized.

794
01:08:41,268 --> 01:08:45,428
And l know about your experiments
with the inmates of your nut house.

795
01:08:45,428 --> 01:08:49,110
See, l don't go into business with a guy
without finding out his dirty secrets.

796
01:08:49,675 --> 01:08:52,473
And those goons you used.

797
01:08:52,473 --> 01:08:54,387
l own the muscle in this town.

798
01:08:54,387 --> 01:08:57,786
Now, l've been bringing
your stuff in for months...

799
01:08:58,315 --> 01:09:02,354
...so whatever he's planning,
it's big, and l want in.

800
01:09:03,595 --> 01:09:06,587
Well, l already know what he'll say.

801
01:09:06,995 --> 01:09:08,314
That we should kill you.

802
01:09:10,115 --> 01:09:13,266
Even he can't get me in here.
Not in my town.

803
01:09:18,995 --> 01:09:20,474
Would you like to see my mask?

804
01:09:21,955 --> 01:09:23,354
l use it in my experiments.

805
01:09:25,755 --> 01:09:30,033
Now, l'm probably not very frightening
to a guy like you.

806
01:09:30,395 --> 01:09:33,114
But these crazies, they can't stand it.

807
01:09:33,995 --> 01:09:35,872
So when did the nut
take over the nut house?

808
01:09:36,795 --> 01:09:39,355
They scream and they cry...

809
01:09:40,315 --> 01:09:41,873
...much as you're doing now.

810
01:09:44,115 --> 01:09:47,187
Well, he's not faking. Not that one.

811
01:09:47,187 --> 01:09:49,789
l'll talk to the judge
and see if l can get him moved...

812
01:09:49,789 --> 01:09:53,231
...to the secure wing at Arkham.
l can't treat him here.

813
01:10:14,355 --> 01:10:15,788
Storm's coming.

814
01:10:20,195 --> 01:10:23,073
The scum is getting jumpy
because you stood up to Falcone.

815
01:10:23,073 --> 01:10:26,625
lt's a start. Your partner
was at the docks with Falcone.

816
01:10:26,625 --> 01:10:29,389
Well, he moonlights
as a low-level enforcer.

817
01:10:29,755 --> 01:10:33,384
They were splitting the shipment in two.
Only half went to the dealers.

818
01:10:33,384 --> 01:10:35,386
Why? What about the other half?

819
01:10:35,835 --> 01:10:38,144
-Flass knows.
-He won't talk.

820
01:10:38,755 --> 01:10:40,268
He'll talk to me.

821
01:10:40,268 --> 01:10:43,347
Commissioner Loeb set up
a massive task force to catch you.

822
01:10:43,795 --> 01:10:46,229
-He thinks you're dangerous.
-What do you think?

823
01:10:47,915 --> 01:10:50,224
l think you're trying to help.

824
01:10:55,035 --> 01:10:57,265
But l've been wrong before.

825
01:11:02,835 --> 01:11:04,473
Come on, l ain't got all night.

826
01:11:07,675 --> 01:11:09,427
Flass, l have kids to feed.

827
01:11:09,875 --> 01:11:11,945
What, they don't like falafel?

828
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:28,353
Where were the other drugs going?

829
01:11:29,595 --> 01:11:31,665
l never knew. l don't know.

830
01:11:31,665 --> 01:11:33,951
-l swear to God.
-Swear to me!

831
01:11:39,355 --> 01:11:42,233
l don't-- l don't know.
l never knew. Never.

832
01:11:42,515 --> 01:11:45,825
They went to some guy for a couple days
before they went to the dealers.

833
01:11:45,825 --> 01:11:47,223
Why?

834
01:11:47,875 --> 01:11:51,311
There was something--
Something else in the drugs...

835
01:11:51,311 --> 01:11:52,988
-...something hidden.
-What?

836
01:11:52,988 --> 01:11:56,352
l never went to the drop-off point.
lt was in the Narrows.

837
01:11:56,352 --> 01:11:59,666
-Cops only go there in force.
-Do l look like a cop?

838
01:11:59,666 --> 01:12:00,666
No--

839
01:12:14,595 --> 01:12:16,551
This is the one l'm talking about.

840
01:12:16,835 --> 01:12:19,030
-What's your problem with it?
-lt shouldn't exist.

841
01:12:19,030 --> 01:12:22,870
This ship left Singapore with
246 containers, but arrived with 247.

842
01:12:22,870 --> 01:12:25,310
l'm guessing there's something
l'm not supposed to find in there.

843
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:28,751
Listen, counselor, we don't wanna
know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.

844
01:12:28,751 --> 01:12:32,112
Things are working a little
differently now. Open it up.

845
01:12:41,315 --> 01:12:42,509
What the hell is this?

846
01:13:23,355 --> 01:13:26,392
lt's you, isn't it?
Everybody's been talking about you.

847
01:13:26,955 --> 01:13:28,627
Get in here!

848
01:13:29,235 --> 01:13:31,271
The other kids won't believe me.

849
01:13:53,435 --> 01:13:55,471
Get rid of all traces.

850
01:13:55,755 --> 01:13:58,553
-Better torch the whole place.
-All right.

851
01:14:33,115 --> 01:14:34,833
Having trouble?

852
01:14:35,515 --> 01:14:37,745
Take a seat. Have a drink.

853
01:14:38,435 --> 01:14:41,552
You look like a man
who takes himself too seriously.

854
01:14:45,115 --> 01:14:47,993
Do you want my opinion?
You need to lighten up.

855
01:15:37,835 --> 01:15:41,384
Alfred, help me.

856
01:15:50,875 --> 01:15:54,106
Blood. Take. Take poison.
Blood poison.

857
01:15:54,106 --> 01:15:57,153
Poisonous. Poisonous.

858
01:16:01,275 --> 01:16:02,913
Bruce...

859
01:16:04,155 --> 01:16:05,270
... why do we fall?

860
01:16:16,874 --> 01:16:20,071
-How long was l out?
-Two days.

861
01:16:20,434 --> 01:16:22,231
lt's your birthday.

862
01:16:23,474 --> 01:16:24,702
Many happy returns.

863
01:16:29,674 --> 01:16:33,349
l've felt these effects before,
but this was so much more potent.

864
01:16:33,349 --> 01:16:37,905
lt was some kind of hallucinogen,
weaponized, in aerosol form.

865
01:16:37,905 --> 01:16:40,907
You have been hanging out
in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne.

866
01:16:40,907 --> 01:16:44,032
l called Mr. Fox when your condition
worsened after the first day.

867
01:16:44,032 --> 01:16:45,513
l analyzed your blood...

868
01:16:45,513 --> 01:16:49,030
...isolating the receptor compounds
and the protein-based catalyst.

869
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:50,912
Am l meant to understand any of that?

870
01:16:51,274 --> 01:16:54,311
Not at all. l just wanted you to know
how hard it was.

871
01:16:54,874 --> 01:16:58,423
-Bottom line, l synthesized an antidote.
-Could you make more?

872
01:16:58,423 --> 01:17:01,062
You planning on gassing yourself
again, Mr. Wayne?

873
01:17:01,062 --> 01:17:04,306
Well, you know how it is.
You're out at night, looking for kicks...

874
01:17:04,306 --> 01:17:07,113
...someone's passing around
the weaponized hallucinogens....

875
01:17:07,113 --> 01:17:10,584
l'll bring what l have.
The antidote should inoculate you for now.

876
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:13,029
Alfred, always a pleasure.

877
01:17:13,029 --> 01:17:14,786
Lucius.

878
01:17:19,114 --> 01:17:21,674
-You sure you don't want to come in?
-l have to get back.

879
01:17:21,674 --> 01:17:23,472
-l wanted to leave this.
-Thank you.

880
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:24,953
Rachel?

881
01:17:26,274 --> 01:17:29,346
Looks like someone's been
burning the candle at both ends.

882
01:17:29,346 --> 01:17:32,108
-Must've been quite an occasion.
-lt is my birthday.

883
01:17:32,108 --> 01:17:35,789
l know. l'm sorry l can't come tonight.
l was just dropping off your present.

884
01:17:35,789 --> 01:17:39,264
-You've got better plans?
-My boss has been missing for days...

885
01:17:39,264 --> 01:17:42,983
...which means l should probably start
by looking at the bottom of the river.

886
01:17:42,983 --> 01:17:44,587
-Rachel.
-Excuse me.

887
01:17:47,354 --> 01:17:48,548
Rachel Dawes.

888
01:17:49,114 --> 01:17:52,584
Who authorized that? Get Crane down
there now. Don't take no for an answer.

889
01:17:52,584 --> 01:17:56,463
Call Dr. Lehmann, tell him we need our
own assessment to the judge by morning.

890
01:17:56,874 --> 01:17:58,626
-What's wrong?
-lt's Falcone.

891
01:17:58,626 --> 01:18:01,183
Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum
on suicide watch.

892
01:18:01,183 --> 01:18:04,232
You're going to Arkham now?
lt's in the Narrows, Rachel.

893
01:18:05,434 --> 01:18:07,186
You enjoy your party, Bruce.

894
01:18:07,186 --> 01:18:09,993
-Some of us have work to do.
-You be careful.

895
01:18:11,674 --> 01:18:13,187
Happy birthday.

896
01:18:31,794 --> 01:18:33,830
But, Master Wayne,
the guests will be arriving.

897
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:35,552
Keep them happy until l arrive.

898
01:18:35,552 --> 01:18:37,830
Tell them that joke you know.

899
01:19:15,074 --> 01:19:16,712
Having fun?

900
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:22,190
Bill? Now, what's a big shot like you
doing in a place like this?

901
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:23,582
l need some information.

902
01:19:23,582 --> 01:19:28,350
The Wayne Enterprise 47-B, 1-ME.

903
01:19:29,594 --> 01:19:31,027
1-ME.

904
01:19:31,027 --> 01:19:34,789
lt's a microwave emitter. lt was designed
to vaporize an enemy's water supply.

905
01:19:34,789 --> 01:19:38,993
Rumor was they tested dispersing
water-based chemicals into the air...

906
01:19:38,993 --> 01:19:41,031
...but isn't that illegal?

907
01:19:42,674 --> 01:19:46,747
l want all the information
on the development of this project...

908
01:19:46,747 --> 01:19:50,748
...all data, files, backup disks,
on my desk right away.

909
01:19:51,114 --> 01:19:52,706
Did you lose one?

910
01:19:53,714 --> 01:19:57,184
l'm merging your department
with Archives.

911
01:19:58,354 --> 01:19:59,582
And l am firing you.

912
01:20:01,634 --> 01:20:03,545
Didn't you get the memo?

913
01:20:10,474 --> 01:20:12,066
Scarecrow.

914
01:20:15,234 --> 01:20:17,031
Scarecrow.

915
01:20:20,234 --> 01:20:21,508
Scarecrow.

916
01:20:24,394 --> 01:20:26,510
Miss Dawes, this is most irregular.

917
01:20:26,510 --> 01:20:29,472
l have nothing to add
to the report l filed with the judge.

918
01:20:29,472 --> 01:20:31,784
-l have questions about your report.
-Such as?

919
01:20:31,784 --> 01:20:36,072
lsn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man
who has no history of mental illness...

920
01:20:36,072 --> 01:20:39,704
...to have a psychotic breakdown
just when he's about to be indicted?

921
01:20:39,704 --> 01:20:43,947
As you can see for yourself, there is
nothing convenient about his symptoms.

922
01:20:48,394 --> 01:20:49,747
-Scarecrow.
-What's scarecrow?

923
01:20:50,194 --> 01:20:53,664
Patients suffering delusional episodes
often focus their paranoia...

924
01:20:53,664 --> 01:20:55,870
...on an external tormentor...

925
01:20:55,870 --> 01:20:59,106
...usually one conforming
to Jungian archetypes.

926
01:20:59,314 --> 01:21:01,623
ln this case, a scarecrow.

927
01:21:03,034 --> 01:21:06,993
-He's drugged?
-Psychopharmacology is my primary field.

928
01:21:06,993 --> 01:21:08,507
I'm a strong advocate.

929
01:21:09,354 --> 01:21:11,470
Outside, he was a giant.

930
01:21:11,470 --> 01:21:13,989
ln here, only the mind
can grant you power.

931
01:21:13,989 --> 01:21:15,826
You enjoy the reversal.

932
01:21:15,826 --> 01:21:18,872
l respect the mind's power
over the body.

933
01:21:18,872 --> 01:21:20,513
lt's why l do what l do.

934
01:21:20,513 --> 01:21:25,384
l do what l do to keep thugs like Falcone
behind bars, not in therapy.

935
01:21:25,384 --> 01:21:28,705
l want my own psychiatric consultant
to have full access to Falcone...

936
01:21:28,705 --> 01:21:32,071
...including blood work.
Find out what exactly you put him on.

937
01:21:32,071 --> 01:21:34,623
-First thing tomorrow, then.
-Tonight.

938
01:21:34,623 --> 01:21:38,104
l've already paged Dr. Lehmann
at County General.

939
01:21:39,434 --> 01:21:41,186
As you wish.

940
01:21:46,474 --> 01:21:48,351
This way, please.

941
01:21:48,351 --> 01:21:51,028
There's something
l think you should see.

942
01:22:01,474 --> 01:22:03,988
This is where we make the medicine.

943
01:22:10,514 --> 01:22:14,268
Perhaps you should have some,
clear your head.

944
01:22:38,474 --> 01:22:40,032
Who knows you're here?

945
01:22:41,034 --> 01:22:42,592
Who knows?

946
01:22:49,514 --> 01:22:50,708
He's here.

947
01:22:50,708 --> 01:22:52,068
Who?

948
01:22:52,068 --> 01:22:54,111
The Batman.

949
01:22:55,834 --> 01:22:57,665
-What do we do?
-What anyone does...

950
01:22:57,665 --> 01:23:00,507
...when a prowler comes around.

951
01:23:01,394 --> 01:23:03,862
-Call the police.
-You want the cops here?

952
01:23:04,394 --> 01:23:07,067
At this point, they can't stop us.

953
01:23:07,067 --> 01:23:10,624
But the Batman
has a talent for disruption.

954
01:23:10,624 --> 01:23:13,866
Force him outside,
the police will take him down. Go.

955
01:23:13,866 --> 01:23:16,070
-What about her?
-She hasn't got long.

956
01:23:16,070 --> 01:23:18,111
l gave her a concentrated dose.

957
01:23:18,111 --> 01:23:20,742
The mind can only take so much.
Now go.

958
01:23:23,154 --> 01:23:25,349
The things they say about him.

959
01:23:25,349 --> 01:23:26,993
Can he really fly?

960
01:23:26,993 --> 01:23:29,145
l heard he can disappear.

961
01:23:29,145 --> 01:23:32,226
Well, we'll find out.

962
01:23:32,474 --> 01:23:34,066
Won't we?

963
01:24:19,434 --> 01:24:21,504
Taste of your own medicine, doctor?

964
01:24:27,874 --> 01:24:29,671
What have you been doing here?

965
01:24:32,634 --> 01:24:34,943
Who are you working for?

966
01:24:39,194 --> 01:24:41,469
Ra's-- Ra's al Ghul.

967
01:24:41,469 --> 01:24:46,310
Ra's al Ghul is dead.
Who are you working for?

968
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:47,463
Crane.

969
01:24:49,834 --> 01:24:52,667
Dr. Crane isn't here right now.

970
01:24:53,194 --> 01:24:55,025
But if you'd like to make
an appointment....

971
01:25:07,514 --> 01:25:10,312
Batman, put down your weapons
and surrender.

972
01:25:10,994 --> 01:25:12,347
You're surrounded.

973
01:25:17,674 --> 01:25:20,347
-What are you waiting for?
-Backup.

974
01:25:21,034 --> 01:25:23,343
-Backup?
-The Batman's in there.

975
01:25:23,343 --> 01:25:25,584
SWAT's on the way.
But if you wanna go in now...

976
01:25:25,584 --> 01:25:27,233
...l'll be right behind you, sir.

977
01:25:28,674 --> 01:25:30,153
SWAT's on the way.

978
01:25:31,194 --> 01:25:32,422
-Hey.
-Hey.

979
01:26:13,194 --> 01:26:14,832
What's happened to her?

980
01:26:17,394 --> 01:26:21,023
Crane poisoned her with a psychotropic
hallucinogen, a panic-inducing toxin.

981
01:26:22,954 --> 01:26:26,549
-Let me get her down to the medics.
-They can't help her, but l can.

982
01:26:30,314 --> 01:26:32,384
Get her downstairs.
Meet me in the alley.

983
01:26:40,034 --> 01:26:42,787
Crane's been smuggling his toxin
hidden in Falcone's drugs...

984
01:26:42,787 --> 01:26:45,024
...and they're dumping it
into the water supply.

985
01:26:45,514 --> 01:26:47,106
-What was he planning?
-l don't know.

986
01:26:47,314 --> 01:26:48,588
Was he working for Falcone?

987
01:26:49,034 --> 01:26:51,468
He mentioned someone else,
someone worse.

988
01:26:51,468 --> 01:26:54,102
She needs the antidote
before the damage is permanent.

989
01:26:54,102 --> 01:26:56,390
-How long does she have?
-Not long.

990
01:27:00,114 --> 01:27:01,832
What is that?

991
01:27:03,154 --> 01:27:05,349
-Backup.
-What the--?

992
01:28:20,354 --> 01:28:21,833
Excuse me.

993
01:28:26,394 --> 01:28:29,511
-How is she?
-She's fading. We gotta go.

994
01:28:31,274 --> 01:28:32,673
l'll get my car.

995
01:28:32,673 --> 01:28:34,586
l brought mine.

996
01:28:34,954 --> 01:28:36,546
Yours?

997
01:28:45,474 --> 01:28:47,226
l've gotta get me one of those.

998
01:28:48,394 --> 01:28:50,464
-He is in a vehicle.
-Make and color?

999
01:28:50,464 --> 01:28:52,909
lt's a black...

1000
01:28:54,154 --> 01:28:55,428
...tank.

1001
01:28:57,954 --> 01:28:59,273
Stay calm.

1002
01:28:59,914 --> 01:29:01,632
You've been poisoned.

1003
01:29:04,234 --> 01:29:05,508
l'm on him.

1004
01:29:13,554 --> 01:29:14,589
Breathe slowly.

1005
01:29:24,274 --> 01:29:25,343
Hold on.

1006
01:29:39,234 --> 01:29:40,553
-What are you doing?
-Shortcut.

1007
01:29:48,714 --> 01:29:50,432
Air One to ground, block that ramp.

1008
01:29:54,794 --> 01:29:56,352
He's got no way off that roof.

1009
01:29:57,674 --> 01:30:00,666
Turn off your engine.
Step away from the car.

1010
01:30:02,914 --> 01:30:05,587
-Trust me.
-Weapons system activated.

1011
01:30:22,754 --> 01:30:23,982
Who is this guy?

1012
01:30:24,274 --> 01:30:25,946
-Where's he going?
-He's on the roof.

1013
01:30:39,754 --> 01:30:41,870
-What street is he taking?
-He's not on a street.

1014
01:30:41,870 --> 01:30:43,706
He's flying on rooftops.

1015
01:31:21,314 --> 01:31:23,464
At least tell me what it looks like.

1016
01:31:26,354 --> 01:31:27,753
Never mind.

1017
01:31:31,474 --> 01:31:32,793
Got him.

1018
01:31:43,234 --> 01:31:44,747
Coming right up on his butt.

1019
01:32:08,434 --> 01:32:10,789
We're tracking suspect vehicle
heading west on I-17.

1020
01:32:15,834 --> 01:32:17,472
-Air One to ground.
-l lost him.

1021
01:32:17,472 --> 01:32:19,431
We've lost visual. Exit 9 is blocked.

1022
01:32:19,431 --> 01:32:21,505
We'll loop back to check
the frontage road.

1023
01:32:21,505 --> 01:32:23,710
Stealth mode activated.

1024
01:32:24,314 --> 01:32:25,508
Stay with me.

1025
01:32:31,434 --> 01:32:32,867
What--? There he is.

1026
01:32:51,754 --> 01:32:53,153
Just hold on.

1027
01:32:56,954 --> 01:32:58,103
Rachel!

1028
01:33:29,514 --> 01:33:31,789
-They get any of this into the mains?
-Yeah.

1029
01:33:31,789 --> 01:33:34,707
Notify the water company.
There's gotta be a way to isolate it.

1030
01:33:34,707 --> 01:33:37,627
No. They put it all in.
They must've been at this for weeks.

1031
01:33:37,627 --> 01:33:41,230
-Gotham's entire water supply is laced.
-Why haven't we felt the effects?

1032
01:33:41,230 --> 01:33:43,589
Must be a compound that has
to be absorbed through the lungs.

1033
01:33:53,394 --> 01:33:55,032
How do you feel?

1034
01:33:57,674 --> 01:33:59,107
Where are we?

1035
01:33:59,594 --> 01:34:03,223
-Why did you bring me here?
-lf l hadn't, your mind would be lost.

1036
01:34:03,223 --> 01:34:05,350
-You were poisoned.
-lt was--

1037
01:34:05,350 --> 01:34:08,984
-lt was Dr. Crane.
-Rest. Gordon has Crane.

1038
01:34:08,984 --> 01:34:11,190
ls Sergeant Gordon your friend?

1039
01:34:11,994 --> 01:34:13,586
l don't have the luxury of friends.

1040
01:34:14,434 --> 01:34:17,631
l'm gonna give you a sedative.
You'll wake up back at home.

1041
01:34:17,631 --> 01:34:21,582
When you do, get these to Gordon,
and Gordon alone. Trust no one.

1042
01:34:21,582 --> 01:34:23,426
-What are they?
-The antidote.

1043
01:34:23,426 --> 01:34:26,791
One for Gordon to inoculate himself,
the other for mass production.

1044
01:34:27,154 --> 01:34:28,382
Mass production?

1045
01:34:28,382 --> 01:34:31,591
Crane was just a pawn.
We need to be ready.

1046
01:34:56,474 --> 01:34:59,750
When you told me your grand plan
for saving Gotham...

1047
01:34:59,750 --> 01:35:02,712
...all that stopped me
from calling the men in white coats...

1048
01:35:02,712 --> 01:35:05,263
...was when you said
it wasn't about thrill-seeking.

1049
01:35:05,263 --> 01:35:08,346
-lt's not.
-What would you call that?

1050
01:35:10,114 --> 01:35:12,708
-Damn good television.
-lt's a miracle no one was killed.

1051
01:35:12,708 --> 01:35:16,389
l didn't have time to observe
the rules of the road, Alfred.

1052
01:35:16,389 --> 01:35:19,546
You're getting lost inside
this monster of yours.

1053
01:35:19,546 --> 01:35:23,946
l'm using this monster to help
other people, just like my father did.

1054
01:35:23,946 --> 01:35:25,627
For Thomas Wayne, helping others...

1055
01:35:25,627 --> 01:35:28,592
...wasn't about proving anything
to anyone, including himself.

1056
01:35:29,034 --> 01:35:32,265
lt's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying.

1057
01:35:32,674 --> 01:35:35,188
She's downstairs, sedated.
l need you to take her home.

1058
01:35:35,474 --> 01:35:38,944
Well, we both care for Rachel, but what
you're doing has to be beyond that.

1059
01:35:39,234 --> 01:35:42,032
lt can't be personal,
or you're just a vigilante.

1060
01:35:42,032 --> 01:35:43,991
-ls Fox still here?
-Yes, sir.

1061
01:35:43,991 --> 01:35:45,746
We need to send these people away.

1062
01:35:45,746 --> 01:35:48,747
Those are Bruce Wayne's guests.
You have a name to maintain.

1063
01:35:48,747 --> 01:35:50,666
l don't care about my name.

1064
01:35:50,666 --> 01:35:53,871
lt's not just your name, sir.
lt's your father's name.

1065
01:35:55,554 --> 01:35:57,829
And it's all that's left of him.

1066
01:35:59,674 --> 01:36:01,187
Don't destroy it.

1067
01:36:15,874 --> 01:36:17,944
-Mr. Earle.
-Happy birthday, Bruce.

1068
01:36:17,944 --> 01:36:19,467
Thank you.

1069
01:36:19,754 --> 01:36:21,710
How did the stock offering go?

1070
01:36:21,954 --> 01:36:23,103
Prices soared.

1071
01:36:23,103 --> 01:36:24,468
Who was buying?

1072
01:36:24,468 --> 01:36:26,465
All kinds of funds and brokerages.

1073
01:36:26,465 --> 01:36:28,272
lt's a bit technical.

1074
01:36:28,272 --> 01:36:30,072
The key thing is...

1075
01:36:30,072 --> 01:36:32,145
...our company's future is secure.

1076
01:36:33,914 --> 01:36:34,903
Great.

1077
01:36:48,034 --> 01:36:50,264
A little the worse for wear, l'm afraid.

1078
01:36:55,754 --> 01:36:57,472
What was the plan, Crane?

1079
01:36:57,472 --> 01:36:59,784
How were you gonna get
your toxin into the air?

1080
01:37:00,154 --> 01:37:03,305
Scarecrow. Scarecrow.

1081
01:37:03,305 --> 01:37:05,226
Who were you working for, Crane?

1082
01:37:07,234 --> 01:37:09,350
Oh, it's too late.

1083
01:37:09,914 --> 01:37:11,950
You can't stop it now.

1084
01:37:16,794 --> 01:37:18,273
Here.

1085
01:37:18,273 --> 01:37:20,345
-Happy birthday, Bruce.
-Thank you. Thanks.

1086
01:37:20,345 --> 01:37:23,312
And thank you for that item.

1087
01:37:24,754 --> 01:37:25,948
You're welcome.

1088
01:37:25,948 --> 01:37:28,787
-l know you'll put it to good use.
-l already have.

1089
01:37:29,034 --> 01:37:32,709
How long would it take
to manufacture on a large scale?

1090
01:37:33,234 --> 01:37:34,303
Weeks. Why?

1091
01:37:34,303 --> 01:37:37,511
Somebody's planning to disperse
the toxin using the water supply.

1092
01:37:38,474 --> 01:37:41,432
The water supply won't help you
disperse an inhalant.

1093
01:37:42,314 --> 01:37:43,667
What?

1094
01:37:43,667 --> 01:37:46,268
Unless you have a microwave emitter
powerful enough...

1095
01:37:46,268 --> 01:37:49,187
...to vaporize all the water
in the mains.

1096
01:37:49,594 --> 01:37:52,745
A microwave emitter like the one
Wayne Enterprises just misplaced.

1097
01:37:53,154 --> 01:37:54,303
Misplaced?

1098
01:37:54,303 --> 01:37:57,830
Earle just fired me for asking
too many questions about it.

1099
01:37:59,754 --> 01:38:03,110
Go back to Wayne Enterprises now
and start making more of that antidote.

1100
01:38:03,110 --> 01:38:06,266
The police are gonna need as much
as they can get their hands on.

1101
01:38:06,266 --> 01:38:08,425
My security clearance
has been revoked.

1102
01:38:08,425 --> 01:38:10,505
That wouldn't stop a man like you,
would it?

1103
01:38:10,914 --> 01:38:12,552
l suppose not.

1104
01:38:14,514 --> 01:38:18,985
-Bruce, there's somebody you must meet.
-Not now, Mrs. Delane.

1105
01:38:18,985 --> 01:38:21,907
Now, am l pronouncing this right...

1106
01:38:21,907 --> 01:38:24,429
...Mr. Ra's al Ghul?

1107
01:38:29,834 --> 01:38:31,552
You're not Ra's al Ghul.

1108
01:38:33,034 --> 01:38:34,262
l watched him die.

1109
01:38:34,262 --> 01:38:37,346
But is Ra's al Ghul immortal?

1110
01:38:39,994 --> 01:38:42,349
Are his methods supernatural?

1111
01:38:46,714 --> 01:38:50,946
Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal
your true identity, Ra's?

1112
01:38:52,714 --> 01:38:57,026
Surely a man who spends his nights
scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham...

1113
01:38:57,026 --> 01:38:59,150
...wouldn't begrudge me
dual identities.

1114
01:38:59,954 --> 01:39:01,672
l saved your life.

1115
01:39:01,672 --> 01:39:04,223
l warned you about compassion, Bruce.

1116
01:39:07,274 --> 01:39:09,390
Your quarrel is with me.

1117
01:39:10,234 --> 01:39:12,623
You let these people go.

1118
01:39:12,874 --> 01:39:16,025
You are welcome to explain
the situation to them.

1119
01:39:18,194 --> 01:39:19,752
Everyone.

1120
01:39:20,514 --> 01:39:22,311
Everybody?

1121
01:39:24,794 --> 01:39:26,591
l....

1122
01:39:27,034 --> 01:39:31,107
l want to thank you all for coming here
tonight and drinking all of my booze.

1123
01:39:33,114 --> 01:39:34,752
No, really.

1124
01:39:35,754 --> 01:39:38,393
There's a thing about being a Wayne...

1125
01:39:38,393 --> 01:39:41,990
...that you're never short of
a few freeloaders, like yourselves...

1126
01:39:41,990 --> 01:39:45,669
...to fill up your mansion with.
So here's to you people. Thank you.

1127
01:39:45,669 --> 01:39:48,348
-That's enough, Bruce.
-l'm not finished.

1128
01:39:48,674 --> 01:39:50,312
To all of you....

1129
01:39:50,312 --> 01:39:54,672
All of you phonies,
all of you two-faced friends...

1130
01:39:54,672 --> 01:39:59,703
...you sycophantic suck-ups
who smile through your teeth at me...

1131
01:39:59,703 --> 01:40:03,310
...please, leave me in peace.

1132
01:40:03,310 --> 01:40:05,988
Please go.

1133
01:40:06,314 --> 01:40:09,590
Stop smiling, it's not a joke.
Please leave.

1134
01:40:09,590 --> 01:40:11,870
The party's over, get out.

1135
01:40:11,870 --> 01:40:15,151
The apple has fallen very far
from the tree, Mr. Wayne.

1136
01:40:19,794 --> 01:40:21,989
He's turning into a jerk.

1137
01:40:28,034 --> 01:40:29,706
Amusing.

1138
01:40:29,994 --> 01:40:33,304
But pointless.
None of these people have long to live.

1139
01:40:33,304 --> 01:40:36,830
Your antics at the asylum
have forced my hand.

1140
01:40:36,830 --> 01:40:39,064
So Crane was working for you.

1141
01:40:39,064 --> 01:40:42,909
His toxin is derived from the organic
compound found in our blue flowers.

1142
01:40:43,234 --> 01:40:45,190
He was able to weaponize it.

1143
01:40:45,190 --> 01:40:47,265
He's not a member of
the League of Shadows?

1144
01:40:47,265 --> 01:40:51,791
Of course not. He thought our plan
was to hold the city to ransom.

1145
01:40:52,474 --> 01:40:56,831
But really, you are gonna release
Crane's poison on the entire city.

1146
01:40:56,831 --> 01:41:00,873
Then watch Gotham tear itself apart
through fear.

1147
01:41:13,194 --> 01:41:15,025
You're gonna destroy millions of lives.

1148
01:41:15,234 --> 01:41:18,431
Only a cynical man would call
what these people have lives, Wayne.

1149
01:41:18,431 --> 01:41:20,346
Crime. Despair.

1150
01:41:20,346 --> 01:41:22,505
This is not how man
was supposed to live.

1151
01:41:23,114 --> 01:41:26,151
The League of Shadows has been
a check against human corruption...

1152
01:41:26,151 --> 01:41:27,747
...for thousands of years.

1153
01:41:27,747 --> 01:41:31,350
We sacked Rome.
Loaded trade ships with plague rats.

1154
01:41:31,350 --> 01:41:32,867
Burned London to the ground.

1155
01:41:32,867 --> 01:41:35,753
Every time a civilization reaches
the pinnacle of its decadence...

1156
01:41:35,753 --> 01:41:37,791
...we return to restore the balance.

1157
01:41:37,791 --> 01:41:39,467
Gotham isn't beyond saving.

1158
01:41:40,714 --> 01:41:43,308
Give me more time.
There are good people here.

1159
01:41:43,308 --> 01:41:45,226
You're defending a city so corrupt...

1160
01:41:45,226 --> 01:41:48,431
...we have infiltrated
every level of its infrastructure.

1161
01:41:59,074 --> 01:42:00,393
Time to play.

1162
01:42:04,394 --> 01:42:06,954
When l found you in that jail,
you were lost.

1163
01:42:06,954 --> 01:42:09,150
But l believed in you.

1164
01:42:09,150 --> 01:42:12,909
l took away your fear,
and l showed you a path.

1165
01:42:13,154 --> 01:42:15,304
You were my greatest student.

1166
01:42:15,594 --> 01:42:18,631
lt should be you standing by my side,
saving the world.

1167
01:42:19,394 --> 01:42:21,908
l'll be standing where l belong.

1168
01:42:22,514 --> 01:42:25,506
Between you
and the people of Gotham.

1169
01:42:27,114 --> 01:42:29,628
No one can save Gotham.

1170
01:42:32,834 --> 01:42:37,305
When a forest grows too wild,
a purging fire is inevitable and natural.

1171
01:42:38,474 --> 01:42:42,945
Tomorrow the world will watch in horror
as its greatest city destroys itself.

1172
01:42:43,474 --> 01:42:46,591
The movement back to harmony
will be unstoppable this time.

1173
01:42:46,874 --> 01:42:48,990
-You attacked Gotham before?
-Of course.

1174
01:42:49,194 --> 01:42:51,754
Over the ages our weapons
have grown more sophisticated.

1175
01:42:51,754 --> 01:42:54,667
With Gotham we tried a new one.
Economics.

1176
01:42:55,074 --> 01:42:59,590
But we underestimated certain
of Gotham's citizens...

1177
01:42:59,994 --> 01:43:02,110
...such as your parents.

1178
01:43:05,994 --> 01:43:09,350
Gunned down by one of the very people
they were trying to help.

1179
01:43:09,594 --> 01:43:12,267
Create enough hunger
and everyone becomes a criminal.

1180
01:43:12,267 --> 01:43:14,789
Their deaths galvanized the city
into saving itself...

1181
01:43:14,789 --> 01:43:17,548
...and Gotham has limped on
ever since.

1182
01:43:17,548 --> 01:43:19,432
We are back to finish the job.

1183
01:43:20,114 --> 01:43:23,231
And this time no misguided idealists
will get in the way.

1184
01:43:23,231 --> 01:43:26,830
Like your father, you lack the courage
to do all that is necessary.

1185
01:43:27,114 --> 01:43:29,867
lf someone stands in the way
of true justice...

1186
01:43:29,867 --> 01:43:33,947
...you simply walk up behind them
and stab them in the heart.

1187
01:43:38,754 --> 01:43:40,824
-l am gonna stop you.
-You never did learn...

1188
01:43:40,824 --> 01:43:42,950
...to mind your surroundings.

1189
01:43:45,034 --> 01:43:46,945
Justice is balance.

1190
01:43:46,945 --> 01:43:49,184
You burned my house
and left me for dead.

1191
01:43:51,754 --> 01:43:53,824
Consider us even.

1192
01:44:09,554 --> 01:44:11,226
No one comes out. Make sure.

1193
01:44:20,714 --> 01:44:22,113
They're all gone?

1194
01:44:22,113 --> 01:44:24,913
-How many from maximum security?
-Every one of them.

1195
01:44:24,913 --> 01:44:26,792
Serial killers, rapists.

1196
01:44:26,994 --> 01:44:29,713
Raise the bridges.
We don't want any getting off the island.

1197
01:44:29,713 --> 01:44:31,273
Yeah, l'll raise the bridges...

1198
01:44:31,273 --> 01:44:35,507
...when l get every available unit out here
to catch the homicidal maniacs...

1199
01:44:35,507 --> 01:44:38,427
-...that are running loose out there.
-Come on!

1200
01:45:00,674 --> 01:45:03,313
l hope you're not a member
of the fire brigade.

1201
01:45:09,074 --> 01:45:11,110
Master Wayne! Master Wayne!

1202
01:45:15,434 --> 01:45:19,632
What is the point of all those pushups
if you can't even lift a bloody log?

1203
01:45:56,514 --> 01:45:58,505
What have l done, Alfred?

1204
01:45:59,474 --> 01:46:01,351
Everything my family...

1205
01:46:01,351 --> 01:46:03,345
...my father, built....

1206
01:46:05,634 --> 01:46:09,388
The Wayne legacy is more
than bricks and mortar, sir.

1207
01:46:09,388 --> 01:46:11,704
l wanted to save Gotham.

1208
01:46:12,514 --> 01:46:14,311
l failed.

1209
01:46:15,474 --> 01:46:16,702
Why do we fall, sir?

1210
01:46:19,754 --> 01:46:23,110
So that we can learn
to pick ourselves up.

1211
01:46:25,474 --> 01:46:27,544
You still haven't given up on me?

1212
01:46:29,354 --> 01:46:30,787
Never.

1213
01:46:31,794 --> 01:46:33,068
Down!

1214
01:46:33,068 --> 01:46:36,032
Harassment! l see harassment!

1215
01:46:36,032 --> 01:46:38,185
Maybe you'd like to see
some excessive force?

1216
01:46:38,185 --> 01:46:40,185
Madman with a gun.

1217
01:46:41,314 --> 01:46:44,511
With residents furious at the
unprecedented show of police strength...

1218
01:46:44,511 --> 01:46:47,950
-... to round up the inmates....
-We're about to raise these bridges.

1219
01:46:47,950 --> 01:46:51,584
Officer, l am a Gotham City
district attorney. Let me pass.

1220
01:46:58,674 --> 01:47:00,869
-Just shut up!
-Hey, Flass, cool it!

1221
01:47:00,869 --> 01:47:02,262
Hold these people back.

1222
01:47:02,262 --> 01:47:05,312
Hey, Gordon.
Somebody here to see you.

1223
01:47:05,312 --> 01:47:07,783
-What are you doing here?
-Our friend sent me with this.

1224
01:47:07,783 --> 01:47:09,353
lt counteracts Crane's toxin.

1225
01:47:09,353 --> 01:47:10,947
Hopefully you won't need it.

1226
01:47:10,947 --> 01:47:14,151
Not unless he's got some way
of getting that crap into the air.

1227
01:47:15,234 --> 01:47:17,589
All right, last one across.

1228
01:47:18,234 --> 01:47:21,988
People, they want this bridge up
in no more than three minutes!

1229
01:47:22,194 --> 01:47:25,425
Better get you off the island before
they raise the bridges. Patrolman!

1230
01:47:26,034 --> 01:47:27,023
Go!

1231
01:47:52,714 --> 01:47:54,466
l can't find my mom.

1232
01:47:54,794 --> 01:47:56,227
Hey!

1233
01:48:04,274 --> 01:48:05,946
What the hell are you doing?

1234
01:48:07,394 --> 01:48:08,907
Gentlemen...

1235
01:48:09,314 --> 01:48:11,748
...time to spread the word.

1236
01:48:13,394 --> 01:48:14,747
And the word is...

1237
01:48:15,954 --> 01:48:17,626
...panic.

1238
01:48:40,714 --> 01:48:42,272
Jesus. The pressure, it's spiking.

1239
01:48:43,234 --> 01:48:44,508
Right there.

1240
01:48:44,794 --> 01:48:46,944
That water main
is right under the Narrows.

1241
01:49:03,194 --> 01:49:04,707
lt's okay.

1242
01:49:36,194 --> 01:49:37,673
This is Commissioner Loeb.

1243
01:49:37,673 --> 01:49:39,472
Come on, somebody talk to me.

1244
01:49:39,472 --> 01:49:41,033
Come on!

1245
01:49:59,914 --> 01:50:01,870
Loeb, Loeb. This is Gordon.

1246
01:50:02,154 --> 01:50:03,428
What the hell is going on?

1247
01:50:03,428 --> 01:50:06,904
We need reinforcements.
TAC teams, SWAT, riot cops!

1248
01:50:06,904 --> 01:50:11,113
Gordon! All the city's riot police
are on the island with you!

1249
01:50:11,113 --> 01:50:13,230
Well, they're completely incapacitated!

1250
01:50:13,514 --> 01:50:17,348
lt's okay, it's okay.
No one's gonna hurt you.

1251
01:50:18,154 --> 01:50:19,746
Of course they are!

1252
01:50:19,746 --> 01:50:22,792
-Crane?
-No. Scarecrow.

1253
01:50:24,474 --> 01:50:25,827
Gordon...

1254
01:50:25,827 --> 01:50:28,144
...there's nobody left to send in.

1255
01:50:29,634 --> 01:50:31,272
So l'm on my own?

1256
01:50:35,194 --> 01:50:36,786
The Narrows is tearing itself to pieces.

1257
01:50:36,786 --> 01:50:39,422
This is just the beginning.
lf they hit the whole city...

1258
01:50:39,422 --> 01:50:42,233
...there's nothing to stop Gotham
tearing itself apart.

1259
01:50:42,233 --> 01:50:44,225
-How are they gonna do that?
-The train.

1260
01:50:44,225 --> 01:50:48,069
The monorail follows the water mains to
the central hub beneath Wayne Tower.

1261
01:50:48,069 --> 01:50:49,872
If the machine gets to the station...

1262
01:50:49,872 --> 01:50:53,390
...it'll cause a chain reaction
that'll vaporize the city's water supply.

1263
01:50:53,390 --> 01:50:55,067
Covering Gotham in this poison.

1264
01:50:55,067 --> 01:50:58,306
l'm gonna stop him from loading
that train, but l may need your help.

1265
01:50:58,306 --> 01:51:00,192
-What do you need?
-Can you drive stick?

1266
01:51:06,194 --> 01:51:07,786
There you are!

1267
01:51:07,786 --> 01:51:09,865
There is nothing to fear...

1268
01:51:09,865 --> 01:51:11,706
...but fear itself!

1269
01:51:12,714 --> 01:51:14,944
l am here to help!

1270
01:51:44,874 --> 01:51:46,944
Batman will save us. He'll come.

1271
01:51:51,954 --> 01:51:53,785
-He'll come.
-Don't peek.

1272
01:52:02,074 --> 01:52:05,305
This is Gordon.
Prepare to lower the bridge.

1273
01:52:10,954 --> 01:52:12,990
l told you he'd come.

1274
01:52:17,794 --> 01:52:19,352
Wait.

1275
01:52:20,274 --> 01:52:21,832
You could die.

1276
01:52:21,832 --> 01:52:23,222
At least tell me your name.

1277
01:52:28,394 --> 01:52:30,510
lt's not who l am underneath...

1278
01:52:31,434 --> 01:52:35,586
...but what l do that defines me.

1279
01:52:35,914 --> 01:52:37,188
Bruce?

1280
01:53:09,514 --> 01:53:12,711
Well, well. You took my advice
about theatricality a bit literally.

1281
01:53:12,711 --> 01:53:15,263
-lt ends here.
-For you and the police, maybe.

1282
01:53:15,263 --> 01:53:17,664
My fight, however,
lies with the rest of Gotham.

1283
01:53:17,664 --> 01:53:21,031
Now, if you'll excuse me,
l have a city to destroy.

1284
01:53:21,031 --> 01:53:24,743
-l can't beat two of your pawns?
-As you wish.

1285
01:53:37,034 --> 01:53:39,264
GPS online.

1286
01:53:45,834 --> 01:53:47,950
In 100 yards.

1287
01:54:17,554 --> 01:54:18,782
Gentlemen.

1288
01:54:45,074 --> 01:54:47,224
Who the hell authorized this?

1289
01:54:57,354 --> 01:54:59,345
Distance to Wayne Tower, three miles.

1290
01:55:06,314 --> 01:55:08,828
The pressure's moving along the mains,
blowing the pipes.

1291
01:55:08,828 --> 01:55:10,313
lf that pressure reaches us...

1292
01:55:10,313 --> 01:55:13,352
...the water supply right across
the whole city is gonna blow!

1293
01:55:23,394 --> 01:55:26,147
At the next intersection, turn right.

1294
01:55:49,834 --> 01:55:51,233
You will never learn.

1295
01:55:58,474 --> 01:55:59,463
Sorry.

1296
01:56:03,274 --> 01:56:06,152
-Familiar. Don't you have anything new?
-How about this?!

1297
01:56:22,234 --> 01:56:24,429
You have arrived at Wayne Tower.

1298
01:56:37,194 --> 01:56:38,388
Evacuate the building.

1299
01:56:38,594 --> 01:56:40,983
We're on top of the main hub
and it's gonna blow.

1300
01:56:49,514 --> 01:56:51,630
Weapons system activated.

1301
01:56:55,554 --> 01:56:56,543
Nice ride.

1302
01:57:11,154 --> 01:57:12,143
Armed.

1303
01:57:23,594 --> 01:57:24,993
Don't be afraid, Bruce.

1304
01:57:27,674 --> 01:57:28,993
Come on. Come on.

1305
01:57:33,554 --> 01:57:35,545
You are just an ordinary man in a cape.

1306
01:57:35,545 --> 01:57:39,423
That's why you couldn't fight injustice,
that's why you can't stop this train.

1307
01:57:39,423 --> 01:57:42,062
Who said anything about stopping it?

1308
01:57:47,634 --> 01:57:49,113
Yes!

1309
01:57:56,954 --> 01:58:00,230
You never learned
to mind your surroundings!

1310
01:58:07,754 --> 01:58:10,143
Have you finally learned to do
what is necessary?

1311
01:58:10,434 --> 01:58:12,629
l won't kill you...

1312
01:58:16,874 --> 01:58:18,944
...but l don't have to save you.

1313
01:59:31,034 --> 01:59:33,992
-The meeting's already started.
-What meeting?

1314
01:59:38,074 --> 01:59:40,872
Fox, l seem to remember firing you.

1315
01:59:41,354 --> 01:59:42,867
You did.

1316
01:59:42,867 --> 01:59:45,025
l got another job.

1317
01:59:45,834 --> 01:59:47,233
Yours.

1318
01:59:47,674 --> 01:59:49,312
On whose authority?

1319
01:59:49,914 --> 01:59:51,745
Batman may have made
the front page...

1320
01:59:51,954 --> 01:59:54,752
...but Bruce Wayne
got pushed to page eight.

1321
02:00:01,274 --> 02:00:02,263
Bruce Wayne.

1322
02:00:02,263 --> 02:00:06,063
What makes you think you can decide
who's running Wayne Enterprises?

1323
02:00:06,063 --> 02:00:08,873
-The fact that l'm the owner.
-What are you talking about?

1324
02:00:09,114 --> 02:00:10,945
The company went public a week ago.

1325
02:00:10,945 --> 02:00:12,513
And l bought most of the shares.

1326
02:00:12,874 --> 02:00:16,184
Through various charitable foundations
and trusts and so forth.

1327
02:00:16,184 --> 02:00:19,426
Look, it's all a bit technical,
but the important thing...

1328
02:00:19,634 --> 02:00:22,785
...is that my company's future
is secure.

1329
02:00:23,154 --> 02:00:24,507
Right, Mr. Fox?

1330
02:00:24,507 --> 02:00:26,426
Right you are, Mr. Wayne.

1331
02:00:28,554 --> 02:00:30,067
Didn't you get the memo?

1332
02:00:48,234 --> 02:00:51,306
-l'm sorry l didn't tell you, Rachel.
-No. No, Bruce...

1333
02:00:51,306 --> 02:00:52,793
...l'm sorry.

1334
02:00:53,634 --> 02:00:56,194
The day that Chill died, l....

1335
02:00:57,994 --> 02:00:59,552
l said terrible things.

1336
02:01:00,034 --> 02:01:01,706
But true things.

1337
02:01:02,314 --> 02:01:04,066
l was a coward with a gun...

1338
02:01:04,066 --> 02:01:07,863
...and justice is about more
than revenge, so thank you.

1339
02:01:08,874 --> 02:01:11,434
l never stopped thinking about you.

1340
02:01:12,874 --> 02:01:14,432
About us.

1341
02:01:15,034 --> 02:01:16,911
And when l heard you were back, l....

1342
02:01:17,714 --> 02:01:19,830
l started to hope.

1343
02:01:42,914 --> 02:01:45,508
But then l found out about your mask.

1344
02:01:46,634 --> 02:01:49,353
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.

1345
02:01:49,954 --> 02:01:51,546
No. This...

1346
02:01:52,674 --> 02:01:54,312
...is your mask.

1347
02:01:56,194 --> 02:01:59,584
Your real face is the one
that criminals now fear.

1348
02:02:00,394 --> 02:02:02,305
The man l loved...

1349
02:02:02,994 --> 02:02:04,393
...the man who vanished...

1350
02:02:05,554 --> 02:02:07,624
...he never came back at all.

1351
02:02:11,914 --> 02:02:14,474
But maybe he's still
out there somewhere.

1352
02:02:16,554 --> 02:02:20,103
Maybe someday,
when Gotham no longer needs Batman...

1353
02:02:21,114 --> 02:02:22,991
...l'll see him again.

1354
02:02:33,594 --> 02:02:36,392
-Proved me wrong, you know.
-About what?

1355
02:02:39,114 --> 02:02:41,469
Your father would be
very proud of you.

1356
02:02:41,674 --> 02:02:43,232
Just like me.

1357
02:03:09,114 --> 02:03:10,911
What will you do?

1358
02:03:12,234 --> 02:03:13,747
Rebuild it.

1359
02:03:14,594 --> 02:03:16,869
Just the way it was, brick for brick.

1360
02:03:23,434 --> 02:03:24,628
Just the way it was, sir?

1361
02:03:26,634 --> 02:03:27,828
Yeah, why?

1362
02:03:27,828 --> 02:03:30,713
l thought this might be
a good opportunity for...

1363
02:03:30,713 --> 02:03:33,229
...improving the foundations.

1364
02:03:33,229 --> 02:03:36,227
-ln the southeast corner?
-Precisely, sir.

1365
02:03:51,274 --> 02:03:54,027
-Nice.
-l couldn't find any mob bosses.

1366
02:03:54,954 --> 02:03:57,548
-Well, sergeant?
-lt's lieutenant now.

1367
02:03:57,874 --> 02:03:59,307
You really started something.

1368
02:03:59,307 --> 02:04:01,385
Bent cops running scared.

1369
02:04:01,385 --> 02:04:02,907
Hope on the streets.

1370
02:04:03,154 --> 02:04:06,624
-But?
-The Narrows is lost.

1371
02:04:07,114 --> 02:04:10,823
And we still haven't picked up Crane or
half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.

1372
02:04:11,474 --> 02:04:13,032
We will.

1373
02:04:13,234 --> 02:04:14,826
We can bring Gotham back.

1374
02:04:14,826 --> 02:04:17,383
-What about escalation?
-Escalation?

1375
02:04:17,383 --> 02:04:21,706
We start carrying semiautomatics,
they buy automatics.

1376
02:04:21,706 --> 02:04:26,026
We start wearing Kevlar,
they buy armor-piercing rounds.

1377
02:04:26,026 --> 02:04:29,345
-And?
-And you're wearing a mask...

1378
02:04:29,754 --> 02:04:31,551
...and jumping off rooftops.

1379
02:04:32,914 --> 02:04:34,870
Now, take this guy.

1380
02:04:35,114 --> 02:04:37,070
Armed robbery, double homicide.

1381
02:04:37,070 --> 02:04:40,351
Got a taste for the theatrical, like you.

1382
02:04:40,594 --> 02:04:42,471
Leaves a calling card.

1383
02:04:48,114 --> 02:04:49,866
l'll look into it.

1384
02:04:53,194 --> 02:04:54,593
l never said thank you.

1385
02:04:59,474 --> 02:05:01,465
And you'll never have to.

1386
02:05:03,365 --> 02:05:13,858
