1
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,882
You've reached Doug. Sorry I missed your call.

2
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,217
Please leave a name and number and I'll get back to you.

3
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:02,644
Hi, you've reached Dr. Stuart Price with Divine Dentistry.

4
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:05,147
Please leave a message after...

5
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,113
Hey, this is Phil.

6
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:16,325
Leave me a message or don't. Do me a favor, don't text me. It's gay.

7
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:19,328
- Anything? - I tried them all.

8
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,580
It keeps going straight to voicemail.

9
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,499
Well, there has to be an explanation.

10
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,460
Sweetie, it's Vegas. You lose track of time in casinos.

11
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:30,005
There's no windows, there's no clocks. He's probably on a heater.

12
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:34,343
And you never walk away from the table when you're on a heater.

13
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,345
You do if you're getting married.

14
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,808
- Hello? - Ahem, Tracy, it's Phil.

15
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,018
Phil, where the hell are you guys?

16
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,437
I'm freaking out.

17
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,022
Yeah, listen.

18
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,649
Uh...

19
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,194
We fucked up.

20
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:57,282
- What are you talking about? - The bachelor party, the whole night. It...

21
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,452
Things got out of control, uh...

22
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,872
...and we lost Doug.

23
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,792
- What? - We can't find Doug.

24
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,379
What are you saying, Phil? We're getting married in five hours.

25
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,673
Yeah.

26
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,968
That's not gonna happen.

27
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,017
To my left a little.

28
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,810
Thank you.

29
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,437
Okey-dokey.

30
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,402
- Whoa, watch it, pervert! - Alan, he's just doing your inseam.

31
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,385
He's getting very close to my shaft.

32
00:04:00,385 --> 00:04:03,200
All done. You can change now.

33
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:06,745
Right. Thanks, Floyd. Thank you very much.

34
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,873
All right, buddy, we should get a move on.

35
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:14,127
You know, Doug, I was thinking...

36
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,858
If you wanna go to Vegas without me,

37
00:04:15,858 --> 00:04:17,422
that is totally cool, you know?

38
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,341
What are you talking about?

39
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,676
You know, Phil and Stu,

40
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:21,843
they're your buddies, 

41
00:04:21,843 --> 00:04:23,011
and it's your bachelor party.

42
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,264
Come on, Alan. Those two love you.

43
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,350
And also, I don't want you to feel like you have to hold back...

44
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,936
...because your wife's brother's there. I just...

45
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,021
It's not like that.

46
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,277
It's not like that. I already told you, Alan.

47
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:42,531
Okay? We're just spending the night in Vegas. It's no big deal.

48
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:46,868
Besides, you're not just my wife's brother, you're my brother now.

49
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:53,083
I want you to know, Doug, I'm a steel trap.

50
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,398
Whatever happens tonight, I will never,

51
00:04:55,398 --> 00:04:57,546
ever, ever, speak a word of it.

52
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,382
Okay. Yeah, I got it. Thank you. I don't think that...

53
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,510
Seriously. I don't care what happens.

54
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,388
- I don't care if we kill someone. - What?

55
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,057
You heard me. It's Sin City.

56
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,477
 I won't tell a soul.

57
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,355
Okay. I got it.

58
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,527
- Thank you.  - No, thank you.

59
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,906
I love you so much.

60
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,659
- Ha. I knew it. - Dad.

61
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,369
Oh, stop it, I'm just jerking around.

62
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:32,205
Alan, put some pants on. You have weird legs.

63
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,415
Yes, Daddy.

64
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,459
- His legs look fine, Dad. - Oh, please.

65
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:39,463
He has his mother's legs. It's just freaky.

66
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:47,012
Alan, I'm just teasing. You have wonderful legs.

67
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,307
They're better than your mother's. They're beautiful.

68
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,769
Can you believe this? Just two more days.

69
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:57,064
I know. You getting nervous?

70
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,566
- You wanna back out? - Shut up.

71
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,985
Just tell me. Oh. Mm.

72
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,781
You know, I don't need to go to Vegas. It's dumb.

73
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:09,451
It's not dumb. It's one night. Have fun, you deserve it.

74
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,703
I know, but we should have gone last weekend.

75
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,706
We have so much to do. L... I'm gonna cancel.

76
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,751
My brother packed his bag two weeks ago. You're not canceling.

77
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,169
- Really? - Yeah.

78
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,380
- Two weeks? - Yeah, he's excited.

79
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,466
Thanks again for bringing him, by the way.

80
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,302
You don't need to thank me, it's nothing. He's a cool guy.

81
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,638
It's not nothing and he's not a cool guy...

82
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,973
...so thank you.

83
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,476
Thank you.

84
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,270
Thank you.

85
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,693
Hey, Sid.

86
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:48,156
I just wanted to thank you guys again for everything you're doing this weekend.

87
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,575
- We couldn't be more excited. - Ah, that's great.

88
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:54,496
Yeah, okay. You love us and we love you. Terrific.

89
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,540
So talk to me about Vegas.

90
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,834
Uh... It should be pretty mellow. 

91
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,337
Do some gambling, maybe catch some rays, have a few laughs.

92
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,674
Yeah, some laughs. I got you.

93
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,300
How you getting out there?

94
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:10,262
Uh, we're gonna take my car. Gonna pick up my friends after this.

95
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,849
- Prius? You're taking a Prius to Vegas? - Yeah.

96
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,685
You know, when you go to Vegas...

97
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,186
...you gotta go to Vegas.

98
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,439
No. Sid.

99
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:27,487
- Really? - Come on, we're family now.

100
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,969
You sure? I mean, you love this car.

101
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:31,783
 Doug, it's just a car.

102
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:36,329
Just make sure to put some Armor All on the tires so the sand doesn't seep in.

103
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,707
Absolutely. That's easy.

104
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,168
Oh, and, uh, don't let Alan drive,

105
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:43,462
because there's something wrong with him.

106
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,671
Understood.

107
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,340
Oh, and Phil either. I don't like him.

108
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:51,970
I will be the only one driving this car. I promise.

109
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,180
Good.

110
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,391
Remember, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.

111
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,059
Ah!

112
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,772
Except for herpes. That shit'll come back with you.

113
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,693
All right. Hold on. I still need some of your permission slips...

114
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,322
...and $90 for the field trip to the Griffith Observatory next weekend.

115
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,491
Pay now, or forever regret missing out

116
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:14,493
on the experience of a lifetime, guys.

117
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,869
You're good, you got it.

118
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,829
- Thanks, Mr. Wenneck.  - Thank you. Hey.

119
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,706
You really came through, thank you.

120
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,001
Whoa, Max. What gives? What, no planetarium?

121
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,420
My mom won't give me the money. I'm grounded.

122
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,714
- Well, how much you got on you? - I don't know.

123
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,217
Like, 20 bucks.

124
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,761
Well, give me the 20 and I'll cover the rest.

125
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,515
- Really? - Yeah. Well, we'll talk about it.

126
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,683
But give me the 20 so I know you're serious.

127
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,603
- Cool. Thanks, Mr. Wenneck. - Yeah.

128
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:06,127
Ahem, do you have to park so close?

129
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:09,130
- Yeah. What's wrong? - I shouldn't be here.

130
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,382
Why is that, Alan?

131
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,969
I'm not supposed to be within 200 feet of a school.

132
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,514
- What? - Or a Chuck E. Cheese.

133
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,061
- Mr. Wenneck, I was... - It's the weekend.

134
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,146
I don't know you. You do not exist.

135
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,149
Shit.

136
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,985
- Nice car. Yeah.

137
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,820
- I'm driving. - Whoa, no chance, buddy...

138
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,072
Don't step... God. Watch the leath...

139
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,033
Shut up and drive before these nerds ask me another question.

140
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,827
- Animal. - Who's this?

141
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,163
- It's Alan. Tracy's brother. - I met you, like, four times.

142
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,624
Oh, yeah. How you doing, man?

143
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,168
Don't forget your Rogaine.

144
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,672
Rogaine, check.

145
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,049
And don't forget to use it.

146
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:56,511
I can totally tell when you forget, your hair just looks thinner.

147
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,223
Using of the Rogaine, check.

148
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,934
Make sure to call me right when you get to the hotel...

149
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,645
...not like that conference in Phoenix.

150
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,315
I had to wait two hours for you to call me.

151
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,151
Yeah, I was the keynote speaker. I was late to the podium.

152
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,529
- Still? - Yeah, you're totally right. I'm sorry.

153
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,533
- What is the matter?  - I don't know.

154
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,453
I hope you're not gonna go to some strip club when you're up there.

155
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,289
Melissa, we're going to Napa Valley.

156
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,083
I don't even think they have strip clubs in wine country.

157
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:31,212
Well, I'm sure if there is one, Phil will sniff it out.

158
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,674
It's not gonna be like that.

159
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,718
Besides, you know how I feel about that.

160
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:40,805
I know, I know. It's just boys and their bachelor parties, it's gross.

161
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:45,226
You're right, it is gross. Mm-mm.

162
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,521
And you know what else, honestly?

163
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:53,401
Why would I risk this for, you know, a couple of minutes...

164
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:58,657
...of some 19-year-old hard body in a schoolgirl outfit?

165
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,992
- Yeah. - Why would I ever need, like...

166
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,079
- You're right. And if you ever do... - What?

167
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,373
...I will fucking kick your ass.

168
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,877
Thank you. Thank you for that.

169
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:14,422
That is exactly what I needed to hear.

170
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,132
Not to mention it's pathetic.

171
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,761
Those places are filthy. And the worst part is...

172
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,138
...that little girl...

173
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:26,017
...grinding and dry humping the fucking stage up there...

174
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,938
...that's somebody's daughter up there. - I was just gonna say that.

175
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,108
See? I just wish your friends were as mature as you.

176
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,486
They are mature, actually. You just have to get to know them better.

177
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,489
Paging Dr. Faggot.

178
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,119
Dr. Faggot!

179
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,916
- I should go. - That's a good idea, Dr. Faggot.

180
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,629
Have a good weekend. I'm gonna miss you.

181
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,186
Road trip!

182
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,608
Vegas! Vegas, baby!

183
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:16,860
Vegas!

184
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,238
You're nuts!

185
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,890
Come on, just till Barstow.

186
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,245
Everybody's passing us.

187
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,873
Absolutely not. I promised Sid.

188
00:12:29,873 --> 00:12:32,333
I will be the only one driving this car.

189
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,668
Besides, you're drinking.

190
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,420
Oh, what are you, a cop now? 

191
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,005
You know I drive great when I'm drunk.

192
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,216
True. Don't forget, Phil was always our designated drunk driver.

193
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,761
Yeah. You wanna explain it to them, Alan?

194
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:46,055
Guys, my dad loves this car more than he loves me, so, yeah.

195
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:49,476
Aw, whatever. I left my wife and kid at home so I could go with you guys.

196
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:52,187
- You know how difficult that was? - That's really sweet.

197
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,314
- Yeah. - Dude, I was being sarcastic.

198
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,565
I fucking hate my life.

199
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:59,068
- I may never go back. I might stay in Vegas. - Here we go.

200
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,237
Doug, enjoy yourself, because come Sunday...

201
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,783
...you're gonna start dying just a little bit every day.

202
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,870
Yeah. That's why I've managed to stay single this whole time, you know?

203
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,831
- Oh, really? That's why you're single? - Yeah.

204
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,958
Cool. Good to know.

205
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,545
- Am I all right over there, Alan? - Yeah, you're good.

206
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,801
Aw, Jesus Christ!

207
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,804
- Oh, my God! - That was awesome!

208
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,264
That was not awesome. What's wrong with you?

209
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,330
That was insane. We almost just died.

210
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,229
You should have seen your face.

211
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,773
- Classic. - That's funny. Ha-ha.

212
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,691
It's not funny.

213
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:59,254
- Boy, you've got a sweet ride there. - Don't touch it.

214
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:04,008
Don't even look at it. Go on, get out.

215
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,220
You heard me. Don't look at me, either.

216
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:12,433
Yeah, you better walk on.

217
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,770
- He's actually kind of funny. - Yeah, he means well.

218
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,314
I'll hit an old man in public.

219
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:21,484
Is he all there? Like, mentally?

220
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,779
I think so. He's just an odd guy. You know, he's kind of weird.

221
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,531
- I mean, should we be worried? - No.

222
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,157
- All right. - No.

223
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,160
Tracy did mention that we shouldn't let him gamble.

224
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:32,954
Or drink too much.

225
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,958
Jesus, he's like a gremlin. Comes with instructions and shit.

226
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,294
And one water.

227
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,629
- All good with Melissa? - Oh, yeah.

228
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:47,093
Told her we're two hours outside of wine country, and she bought it.

229
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,305
You think it's strange you've been in a relationship for years...

230
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,098
...and you have to lie about Vegas?

231
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,976
Yeah, I do. But trust me, it's not worth the fight.

232
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,200
Oh, so you can't go to Vegas

233
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,356
but she can fuck a bellhop on a Carnival Cruise Line?

234
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:05,236
Okay, first of all, he was a bartender.

235
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,654
And she was wasted.

236
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:11,284
And, if you must know, he didn't even come inside her.

237
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:12,994
And you believe that?

238
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:17,749
Uh, yeah, I do believe that, because she's grossed out by semen.

239
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,500
That'll be 32.50.

240
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,837
It's 32.50, you gonna pay for it?

241
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:30,136
It says here we should work in teams. Who wants to be my spotter?

242
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,973
I don't think you should be doing too much gambling tonight, Alan.

243
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,100
Gambling? Who said anything about gambling?

244
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,519
It's not gambling when you know you're gonna win.

245
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,563
Counting cards is a foolproof system.

246
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,273
It's also illegal.

247
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,755
It's not illegal, it's frowned upon,

248
00:15:44,755 --> 00:15:47,070
like masturbating on an airplane.

249
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,657
I'm pretty sure that's illegal too.

250
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:54,077
Yeah, maybe after 9/11, where everybody got so sensitive.

251
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,705
Thanks a lot, Bin Laden.

252
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,961
Either way, you gotta be super smart to count cards, buddy, okay?

253
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,379
- Oh, really? - It's not easy.

254
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,631
Well maybe we should tell that to Rain Man...

255
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,884
...because he practically bankrupted a casino, and he was a retard.

256
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,219
What?

257
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,054
He was a retard.

258
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,139
Retard.

259
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,765
Here we go.

260
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:00,977
WOHi, welcome to Caesars.

261
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,353
Hello. WOChecking in?

262
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,897
Yeah. We have a reservation under Dr. Price.

263
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,275
Okay, let me look that up for you.

264
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,568
Dr. Price?

265
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:12,697
Stu, you're a dentist, okay? Don't try and get fancy.

266
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,075
It's not fancy if it's true. 

267
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,285
He's a dentist. Don't get too excited.

268
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,371
And if, uh, someone has a heart attack, you should still call 911.

269
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,248
We'll be sure to do that.

270
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,793
Can I ask you a question? Do you know if the hotel's pager-friendly?

271
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,838
- What do you mean? - I'm not getting a sig on my beeper.

272
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,300
- I'm not sure. - Is there a payphone bank?

273
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,470
Bunch of payphones? Business.

274
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,181
Um, there's a phone in your room.

275
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,266
That'll work.

276
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:44,312
So I have you in a two-bedroom suite on the 12th floor, is that okay?

277
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,772
It sounds perfect.

278
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,316
Actually, I was wondering if you had any villas.

279
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,069
- We're not even gonna be in the room. - It's unnecessary.

280
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,362
No big deal. We can share beds. It's one night.

281
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,573
If we're share beds, I'm bunking with Phil.

282
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,576
- You good with that? - No, I'm not.

283
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:02,163
Guys, we are not sharing beds. What are we, 12 years old?

284
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,332
Lisa, I apologize. How much is the villa?

285
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,460
Well, we have one villa available, and it's 4200 for the night.

286
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,754
- Is it awesome? - It's pretty awesome.

287
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,027
We'll take it. Give her your credit card.

288
00:18:12,027 --> 00:18:14,133
I can't give her my credit card.

289
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:17,762
- We'll split it. - Are you crazy? No, this is on us.

290
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,100
You don't get it. Melissa checks my statements.

291
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,893
We just need a credit card on file.

292
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:27,146
We won't charge you until check out, so you can figure it out then.

293
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,065
That's perfect. Thank you, Lisa.

294
00:18:29,065 --> 00:18:30,817
We'll deal with it tomorrow. Come on.

295
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,444
Fine.

296
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,197
- Can I ask you another question? - Sure.

297
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,657
You probably get this a lot.

298
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,034
This isn't the real Caesars Palace, is it?

299
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,577
What do you mean?

300
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,288
Did, uh...

301
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,334
- Did Caesar live here? - Um, no.

302
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,170
I didn't think so.

303
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,848
Holy shit.

304
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,851
Now, this is Vegas.

305
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:09,564
Oh, my... This place is enormous.

306
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:10,815
Now we're talking.

307
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,860
Is this all one suite?

308
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,195
Thank you, guys.

309
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,239
Or should I say, "Thank you, Stu"?

310
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,491
You're welcome. It's only because I love you.

311
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:25,496
Hey, guys. Look, free almonds.

312
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,124
- Oh, no, no, no. Please put those back. - Wait, I'm just hungry.

313
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,252
- Well, I know, but... - Stu, what the fuck?

314
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,005
It's a pressure-sensitive plate.

315
00:19:33,025 --> 00:19:35,631
When you pick it up, you have 30 seconds to put it back...

316
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,800
- ...or they bill you. - That's pretty neat.

317
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,428
It may be neat, but it's also very expensive, so...

318
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,889
Those almonds are probably, like, $14.

319
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,932
Stu, relax.

320
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,436
Phil, Melissa is like a forensic accountant, okay?

321
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,771
She scours my statements. If you want nuts...

322
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,941
- ...put your own credit card down. - Watch this.

323
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:59,405
Problem solved. Alan, enjoy your almonds.

324
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,949
I don't want them. He ruined it.

325
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:05,723
All right, let's pick a room, let's get dressed.

326
00:20:05,723 --> 00:20:07,038
Be ready in 30 minutes.

327
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,999
I just wish you could see this place,

328
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:12,460
because you, of all people, would love it.

329
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,963
Yeah. No, it's so quaint.

330
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,175
Yeah, no, there's no TVs, no phones.

331
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:23,429
They just have these cute little antique radios in all the rooms.

332
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,808
What else? Um...

333
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,645
We met the, uh, proprietor.

334
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,189
- Oh, I bet you... - What's his name?

335
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,649
Um, Caesar. Palace.

336
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,318
Yeah, like the salad.

337
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,029
Okay. Well, listen, I gotta go,

338
00:20:40,029 --> 00:20:41,906
because we're gonna hit this wine tasting.

339
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:46,327
Wait, wait. I love you. Okay. Bye.

340
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,580
I'm not even gonna say anything, it's so embarrassing.

341
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,999
- Where's Alan? - He, uh, he went downstairs.

342
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,168
He said he had to grab a few things.

343
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:59,507
Good, because I have something to show you.

344
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,512
- What the hell is that?  - What do you think?

345
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,890
If it's what I think it is, I think it's a big fucking mistake.

346
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:11,686
I'm gonna propose to Melissa at your wedding. After the ceremony.

347
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:15,356
- Stuey, congratulations! - Thank you, Doug.

348
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,526
- That's a beautiful ring. - Yeah. It's my grandmother's.

349
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,654
She made it all the way through the Holocaust with that thing.

350
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,699
Wait, have you not listened to anything I have ever said?

351
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,576
Phil, we've been dating for three years.

352
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,286
It's time. This is how it works.

353
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,706
A, that is bullshit. And B, she is a complete bitch.

354
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,041
Hey, that's his fiancee.

355
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:37,670
What? It's true. It's true. You know it's true. She beats him.

356
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,798
That was twice, and I was out of line.

357
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,384
She's strong-willed. And I respect that.

358
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,431
He's in denial. Not to mention, she fucked a sailor.

359
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:49,890
Hey, he wasn't a sailor.

360
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,477
He was a bartender on a cruise ship. You know that.

361
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,292
Guys, I'm standing right here.

362
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:57,940
So I can hear everything that you're saying.

363
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,234
Hey, guys. You ready to let the dogs out?

364
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,902
- What? - Do what?

365
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,404
Let the dogs out. You know.

366
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,575
Who brought this guy?

367
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,994
Yes, Alan, we are ready to let the dogs out.

368
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,080
- Hey, congrats. - Thank you.

369
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,927
I love this fucking town.

370
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:37,104
- You're not really wearing that, are you? - Wearing what?

371
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,148
The man-purse.

372
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,276
You're actually gonna wear that or are you guys fucking with me?

373
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,571
It's where I keep all my things. I get a lot of compliments on this.

374
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,990
Plus, it's not a man-purse. It's called a satchel.

375
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,283
Indiana Jones wears one.

376
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,786
So does Joy Behar.

377
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,708
- We're going up, guys. - Yeah, that's perfect.

378
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,543
Really?

379
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,337
We're going up?

380
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,886
I'm just saying, it's clearly marked, okay?

381
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,138
We are definitely not supposed to be up here.

382
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,932
Come on, we're paying for a villa.

383
00:23:12,932 --> 00:23:14,558
We can do whatever the fuck we want.

384
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,727
- Yeah, but... - Just wedge the door open.

385
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,188
- Guys, come on up here. - Fine.

386
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:25,528
How the hell did you find this place?

387
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,196
Don't worry about it.

388
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,325
- You all right? - Yeah.

389
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,995
- Look at the view up here. - You happy?

390
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,414
- This is great. - Whoa!

391
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:38,833
Are you kidding?

392
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,377
- Alan, how we doing, buddy? - Good.

393
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,338
What do you got over there, Alan? That's the Eiffel Tower.

394
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,549
Uh-oh.

395
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,426
- Right? - A little J?germeister.

396
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,219
- Good idea. - There it is. Good call.

397
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,470
On the roof.

398
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:55,558
Um, no, this is good. I'd like to make a toast.

399
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,685
To Doug and Tracy.

400
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,646
May tonight be...

401
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:03,107
...but a minor speed bump...

402
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,943
...in an otherwise very long and healthy marriage.

403
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,528
- Cheers. - Cheers.

404
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,737
Short and sweet.

405
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,325
Oh, it's like college.

406
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,911
- All right. I wanna talk about something. - All right.

407
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,371
- I want to... - I'd like to...

408
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,583
I'd like to say something...

409
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,377
...that I prepared...

410
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,255
- ...tonight. - All right, Alan.

411
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,136
"Hello.

412
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,639
How about that ride in?

413
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,892
I guess that's why they call it Sin City.

414
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:45,274
You guys might not know this, but I consider myself a bit of a loner.

415
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:48,652
I tend to think of myself as a one-man wolf pack.

416
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:53,908
But when my sister brought Doug home, I knew he was one of my own.

417
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:58,704
And my wolf pack, it grew by one.

418
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,665
So were there two... So there were two of us in the wolf pack.

419
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:06,128
I was alone first in the pack, and then Doug joined in later.

420
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,714
And six months ago...

421
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,926
...when Doug introduced me to you guys, I thought:

422
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:16,096
'Wait a second. Could it be? ' And now, I know for sure.

423
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,891
I just added two more guys to my wolf pack."

424
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,268
- All right. - All right.

425
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,978
"Four of us wolves...

426
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:27,066
...running around the desert together in Las Vegas...

427
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,693
...looking for strippers and cocaine."

428
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:30,903
So tonight...

429
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,113
...I make a toast.

430
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:35,157
- What...? - What do you got there?

431
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,785
- Dude, what the fuck?  - What the hell are you doing?

432
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,458
- What is that? - Blood brothers.

433
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,126
- Don't... Why did you...? - Damn it.

434
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,419
- Here. - Alan...

435
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,129
- No. - No, I'm not doing that.

436
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,839
- Go ahead, Stuart. - Make him stop.

437
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,551
Alan, we're not gonna cut ourselves. Give me the knife.

438
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,470
Slowly. Thank you. Okay. Thank you very much.

439
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,472
You all right? Are you okay? Mm-hm.

440
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,307
- Do you need a doctor? - He's good.

441
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:01,642
- You sure? - I'm good.

442
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,603
All right, good, because I need everybody to focus.

443
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,049
I wanna take a moment,

444
00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:07,327
I wanna talk about some...

445
00:26:07,327 --> 00:26:08,607
I wanna talk about memory.

446
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,652
No, better yet, I wanna talk about selective memory.

447
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,405
You see, whatever happens here tonight

448
00:26:14,405 --> 00:26:16,991
may as well never have happened at all...

449
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,494
...because this circle's about as far as it's ever gonna go.

450
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:24,290
In other words, forget everything.

451
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,293
Doug, I'm serious. I got a wife and kid.

452
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,275
Okay, good or bad, we don't remember

453
00:26:30,275 --> 00:26:32,172
so we got nothing to talk about.

454
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,175
Nothing, guys. Nothing.

455
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,261
Deal?

456
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,096
- Deal. - Deal.

457
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:43,684
- Perfect. Alan, come here, buddy. гн Get in here, crazy.

458
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:48,230
All right, to a night we'll never remember...

459
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,943
...but the four of us will never forget.

460
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,033
There it is. Hear, hear.

461
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,201
Hey, thanks, guys.

462
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:29,516
Stupid tiger.

463
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,983
What the fuck?

464
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:42,029
Control yourself, man. Goddamn, will you put on some pants?

465
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,115
- Phil, do not go in the bathroom. - AI, just calm down. It's me.

466
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,701
Phil, there is a tiger in the bathroom.

467
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,537
- What's going on? - There's a jungle cat in the bathroom!

468
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:53,207
- Okay, okay, Al. Al, I'll check it out.  гн Don't go in.

469
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:56,168
Don't go in, don't go in. Be careful. Don't, don't.

470
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,672
- Oh! Holy fuck! He's not kidding. гн See? See?

471
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,133
- There's a tiger in there. - No, there isn't.

472
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:08,347
- It's big. Gigantic. - You okay, buddy?

473
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:11,058
No. I am in so much pain right now.

474
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:14,645
Goddamn. Look at this place.

475
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:20,359
I know. Phil, they have my credit card downstairs. I am so screwed.

476
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:23,195
How does a tiger get in the bathroom? It almost killed me.

477
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,239
Hey, bro? You mind putting on some pants?

478
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,449
I find it a little weird I have to ask twice.

479
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,244
Pants at a time like this? I don't have any p...

480
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,664
What the fuck happened last night?

481
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:37,167
Hey, Phil, am I missing a tooth?

482
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,629
I can't... Oh, shit.

483
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,467
Oh, my God.

484
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,594
My lateral incisor's... It's gone!

485
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:52,015
It's okay. Okay, okay. Just calm down. We're fine. Everything's fine.

486
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,433
Alan, go wake up Doug.

487
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:57,437
Let's get some coffee and get the fuck out of Nevada before housekeeping shows.

488
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,000
What am I gonna tell Melissa?

489
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:01,191
I lost a tooth. I have no idea how it happened.

490
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,651
You're freaking me out, man.

491
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,279
I got a massive headache, okay? Let's just calm down.

492
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:08,031
How am I supposed to calm down? Look around you.

493
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:11,410
- Hey, guys, he's not in there. - Did you check all the rooms?

494
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,246
Yeah, I looked everywhere. Plus, his mattress is gone.

495
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,832
He probably went to the pool to get something to eat.

496
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,458
I'll just call his cell.

497
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,087
I look like a nerdy hillbilly.

498
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,394
- Hello? - Alan.

499
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:42,316
- It's Phil. - Oh, hey, Phi...

500
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,985
This is Doug's phone. This is Doug's phone.

501
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,153
No shit.

502
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:53,368
What the fuck is that?

503
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,460
Whose fucking baby is that?

504
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:04,338
Alan, are you sure you didn't see anyone else in the suite?

505
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,548
Yeah, I checked all the rooms. No one's here.

506
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:09,009
Check its collar or something.

507
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,847
- It's okay, baby. - Stu, we don't have time for this.

508
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,683
Let's go hook up with Doug, we'll deal with the baby later.

509
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,019
Phil, we're not gonna leave a baby in the room.

510
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:22,022
- There's a fucking tiger in the bathroom. - It's not our baby.

511
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,107
Yeah, I gotta side with Stu on this one.

512
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,360
All right, fine. Okay, we'll take it with us.

513
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,695
Could you at least just find some pants?

514
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:39,957
Why can't we remember a goddamn thing from last night?

515
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:43,752
Because we obviously had a great fucking time.

516
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,547
Why don't you just stop worrying for one minute?

517
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,049
Be proud of yourself.

518
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:53,345
I don't know, Phil. Maybe it's because I'm missing a tooth.

519
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:58,684
Or maybe it's because there's a tiger in our hotel room...

520
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:02,396
...which, incidentally, is completely destroyed.

521
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:06,024
Oh, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, I know.

522
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:10,904
Maybe it's because we found a baby, a human baby.

523
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,781
That's it. That's it.

524
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:16,910
It's because we found a fucking baby.

525
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,705
You shouldn't curse around the child.

526
00:33:19,705 --> 00:33:21,581
Really? You shouldn't be around a child.

527
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,590
Oh, how cute. What's his name?

528
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,554
- Ben. - Carlos.

529
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,640
Carlos?

530
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,569
Thank you.

531
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:56,783
Hey, Phil, look.

532
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,248
He's jacking his little weenis.

533
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:07,127
- Pull yourself together, man. - Not at the table, Carlos.

534
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,175
I looked everywhere.

535
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:16,595
Gym, casino, front desk. Nobody's seen Doug. He's not here.

536
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,221
He's fine. He's a grown man.

537
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,475
Seriously, Stu, you gotta calm down. Here, have some juice.

538
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,731
I can't have juice right now.

539
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,484
Okay. All right. Let's just track this thing.

540
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,321
What's the last thing we remember doing last night?

541
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,656
Well, the first thing was we were on the roof...

542
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,450
...and were having those shots of J?ger.

543
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,954
And then we ate dinner at The Palm. Right?

544
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,164
That's right.

545
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:48,001
And then we played craps at the Hard Rock, and I think Doug was there.

546
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,420
That sounds right. No, no. He definitely was.

547
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:53,423
You know what, guys? I don't even remember going to dinner.

548
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,426
What the fuck? I don't think I've ever been this hung-over.

549
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,845
After the Hard Rock, I blacked out. It was like emptiness.

550
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,641
Okay. We have up until 10 p. M...

551
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:06,061
...so that gives us a 12-hour window where we could have lost him.

552
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:10,232
гн What is this? - Oh, my God. That is my tooth.

553
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:13,443
Why do you have that? What else is in your pockets?

554
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,696
This is a good thing. No. Check your pockets. Check your pockets.

555
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,365
Do you have anything?

556
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,618
I have an ATM receipt from the Bellagio.

557
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:28,166
Eleven-oh-five for $800! I am so fucked.

558
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:32,546
I have a valet ticket from Caesars. Looks like we got in at 5:15 a.m.

559
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,714
Oh, shit. We drove last night?

560
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,926
Driving drunk. Classic.

561
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,056
What's on your arm?

562
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,976
- What the fuck is that? - Jesus, Phil.

563
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,020
- You were in the hospital last night. - I guess so, yeah.

564
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,565
- You okay? - Yeah, Alan. I'm fine.

565
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:53,567
What the hell is going on?

566
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:56,361
Well, Stu, Stu, this is a good thing. We have a lead now.

567
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,029
Hey, Stu, watch this.

568
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:05,370
- You ever seen a baby do that? - Dude, Alan, not cool.

569
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:12,878
So, uh, are you sure you're qualified to be taking care of that baby?

570
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:14,921
What? I've found a baby before.

571
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,382
- You found a baby before? - Yeah.

572
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,259
- Where? - Coffee Bean.

573
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,137
Wait, what?

574
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,432
Hey, Phil? I don't think Doug would want us to take the Mercedes.

575
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,683
Relax, we'll be careful.

576
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,436
My dad is crazy about that car. He left Doug in charge...

577
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,855
Alan. We got bigger problems here.

578
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,940
Doug could be in the hospital, he could be hurt.

579
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:38,904
- Let's worry about the car later. - Uh, guys? Check it out.

580
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,701
All right, grab it from the other side.

581
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,870
Is that the mattress from Doug's room?

582
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,456
What the fuck?

583
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,792
Hey, man, what's going on here?

584
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,296
Some asshole threw his bed out the window last night.

585
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,798
No shit. 

586
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,967
Some guys just can't handle Vegas.

587
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,514
Oh, God.

588
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,475
It's gonna be okay, Stu.

589
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,853
How the hell did we manage that?

590
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,735
- Here's your car, officers. - Oh, God.

591
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,780
All right, everybody act cool. All right, don't say a word.

592
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:25,242
Come on, let's just get in and go. Come on.

593
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,829
- Stu, you got a five?  - No.

594
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:33,166
- I'll hit you on the way back. - Thank you, sir.

595
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,752
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

596
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:39,506
You just nailed the baby.

597
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:40,674
Are my glasses okay?

598
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:44,219
Your glasses are fine, dick.

599
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,893
This is so illegal.

600
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,312
Can't you see the fun part in anything?

601
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:58,024
Yeah, we're stuck in traffic in a stolen police car...

602
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,193
...with a missing child in the back seat.

603
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,861
Which part of this is fun?

604
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,760
I think the cop-car part's pretty cool.

605
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,866
Thank you, Alan. It is cool.

606
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,868
Doug would love it.

607
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,371
Come on.

608
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,876
- Check this out.  - Oh, no. No, Phil. No, Phil.

609
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,044
Don't do this!

610
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,547
- Take it easy. - Just try to call more attention to us.

611
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,048
- Attention. - Sorry.

612
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,175
Attention, please. Move out of the way.

613
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:25,844
I repeat, please disperse.

614
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,973
Phil, stop the car, I wanna get out. 

615
00:38:29,973 --> 00:38:31,850
Stop the car, I wanna get out. Pull over.

616
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:36,396
Ma'am, in the leopard dress, you have an amazing rack.

617
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:39,691
Get off the sidewalk! Get off the sidewalk!

618
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,318
I should have been a fucking cop.

619
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,409
Look, I already told you.

620
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,746
You came in with a mild concussion, some bruised ribs. No big deal.

621
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,415
Although none of you could articulate how it happened.

622
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,043
Do you remember how many of us were here?

623
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,256
I don't know. I think it was just you guys. Definitely no baby.

624
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:07,052
- And one other guy. - That's our guy. Was he okay?

625
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:11,264
Yeah. He was fine. Just whacked out of his mind. You all were.

626
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:15,101
All right, come forward. And turn.

627
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,269
All right.

628
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,647
There you go. And cough.

629
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:24,694
Cough. Cough. Give me one more.

630
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,031
All right. Thattaboy.

631
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,867
Okay, Felix, you can put your robe on.

632
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,161
And the nurse will be in here in a minute.

633
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,455
I'll see you after the weekend.

634
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,541
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, doctor.

635
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,629
Guys, I really gotta go. I'm sorry.

636
00:39:42,629 --> 00:39:44,381
I have a surgery up on the fourth floor.

637
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:48,385
No, I know. But we just need a couple more minutes of your time.

638
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:55,225
Yeah. Tuck it right in there. I don't want to re-sterilize.

639
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,060
Walk with me.

640
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:04,692
Okay, here we go. Patient name, Phil Wenneck, 2:45 a.m. Arrival.

641
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,737
Minor concussion, like I said. Some bruising. Pretty standard.

642
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,989
Do you mind if I look? I'm actually a doctor.

643
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:12,388
Yeah, you said that several times last night.

644
00:40:12,388 --> 00:40:14,619
But really, you're just a dentist.

645
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:19,791
Okay, this is interesting. Your blood work came in this morning.

646
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,755
They found a large amount of Ruphylin in your system.

647
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:29,759
Ruphylin. Roofies. Commonly known as the date-rape drug.

648
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,679
What, so, what are you saying, I was raped last night?

649
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:35,014
Actually...

650
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:42,313
I don't think so. But someone did slip you the drug.

651
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,023
I'm not surprised you don't remember anything.

652
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,695
Doc, none of us can remember anything from last night. Remember?

653
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:52,115
Yeah. How could someone have drugged all of us?

654
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,491
I wouldn't worry about it.

655
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:56,369
The stuff's out of your system. You're gonna be fine.

656
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,247
Wait, wait, wait. Please, doctor. Is there anything else?

657
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:02,000
Like, something we may have been talking about, 

658
00:41:02,003 --> 00:41:03,751
or some place we were going?

659
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,712
Actually, there was something.

660
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,298
You guys kept talking about some wedding last night.

661
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,092
Yeah. No shit. Our buddy Doug's getting married tomorrow.

662
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,595
- You know what? I want the 100 back. - No, no. Easy.

663
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:16,306
You kept talking about some wedding you just came from.

664
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,807
At the, uh, Best Little Chapel.

665
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,705
You kept saying how sick the wedding

666
00:41:19,705 --> 00:41:21,436
was and getting all crazy about it.

667
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,813
Okay, I hope this helps. I really have to leave.

668
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,357
Best Little Chapel, do you know where that is?

669
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:30,361
I do. It's at the corner of Get A Map and Fuck Off.

670
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:34,240
I'm a doctor, not a tour guide.

671
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:37,577
Figure it out yourself, okay? You're big boys.

672
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:50,757
What about the baby?

673
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,176
Leave him in the car. We're gonna be five minutes.

674
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,178
Whoa, we're not leaving a baby in the car.

675
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,014
He'll be fine. I cracked the window.

676
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:05,104
- What if they don't remember us? - Well, let's just find out.

677
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,650
I'm sor... Excuse me, sir? Hi.

678
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,278
Look at these guys.

679
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:15,532
What happened? You miss me? You miss Eddie? You want more from me?

680
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:19,035
How are you, my friend? Look at this guy. You're fucking crazy.

681
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,245
What's going on, man?

682
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,434
Listen, I'm gonna tell you something.

683
00:42:22,434 --> 00:42:24,123
I know some sick people in my life.

684
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:28,962
This guy is the craziest, wildest bastard I ever met in my life, man.

685
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,964
- This guy? - This guy is out of his mind.

686
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:33,633
What's going on, you fucking crazy motherfucker?

687
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,927
I thought he was gonna eat my dick.

688
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,638
What happened? No love for Eddie? You don't hug me?

689
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,890
No, no. It's not that, Eddie.

690
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,268
Uh, it's just that we're having a hard time

691
00:42:43,268 --> 00:42:45,478
remembering what happened here last night.

692
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,231
Yeah, was there a wedding here? Do you do weddings here?

693
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,651
You are cracking my balls, man.

694
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:54,988
I love these guys. Zolea, what are you doing?

695
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:57,699
Bring my friends some tea, some baklava, huh? Come on.

696
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:59,763
Unbelievable, man. Look at this chick.

697
00:42:59,763 --> 00:43:01,661
Beautiful ass, no fucking brain.

698
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:05,081
But this is Vegas. You want intimacy, forget it. You're gonna get sex.

699
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,584
That's it here, man. No problem for me, though.

700
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:10,003
You want chicks? I can get you beautiful chicks...

701
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,005
...from the Eastern Bloc. No questions.

702
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:15,466
Clean, tight. The tits like that, the nipple like that.

703
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,344
Obviously we were here. We're looking for our friend Doug.

704
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:21,014
- Do you remember? - Yeah, the small guy. Like a monkey.

705
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,348
- Yeah. - You saw him?

706
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:23,516
Of course.

707
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,477
Is there anything you can tell us about

708
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:27,270
what may have happened last night?

709
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,690
You don't remember nothing?

710
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,508
Congratulations, Stu, you got married.

711
00:43:36,508 --> 00:43:38,531
This... This can't be happening.

712
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,868
- Oh, God. - Look at that.

713
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:49,250
I'll tell you one thing, you look seriously happy here, man.

714
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,878
That's it. My life is over.

715
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,796
Stu, it's okay. Look, shit happens.

716
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,466
Come on. Melissa's not gonna know anything about this.

717
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,719
- This never happened. I'll take care of it. - Come on. Put it here.

718
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:00,887
Hey, what's all that?

719
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:05,058
The High Roller package. It's what you ordered. I have coffee mugs.

720
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:07,393
- What? - You have baseball caps, huh?

721
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:10,980
And fancy calendars, all with pictures of Stu and Jade.

722
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,231
Her name's Jade?

723
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:15,652
Yeah, and she's beautiful, man. Clean, very tight. Tits like that.

724
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,571
- But that's because she had a baby. - That explains the baby.

725
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,907
- Oh, Carlos. Carlos. - Great. All right.

726
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:23,201
Uh, here's the deal. We made a mistake last night.

727
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,620
We need this marriage annulled. You do annulments?

728
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:28,539
Of course I do. It breaks my heart and gonna make me sad...

729
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,667
...but it's no problem. Good price for you.

730
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,689
I can't do it with just him, though.

731
00:44:32,689 --> 00:44:34,545
I need the chick. I need both parties.

732
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:37,256
Oh, not a problem. That's great. Isn't that great, Stu?

733
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,759
Come on, buddy. She probably knows where Doug is.

734
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,679
- Awesome. - All right, all right. Okay. Uh...

735
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:46,265
We need her address. She filled out some paperwork, right?

736
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:47,433
Of course.

737
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:49,919
Hey. Excuse me. What is the matter with you?

738
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,437
Go and get the paperwork, man.

739
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:54,440
- I spend my life waiting for you. Come on. - Okay. I'm going.

740
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,818
And get the baklava, please.

741
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,053
Hey, Phil, what about my dad's car?

742
00:45:03,053 --> 00:45:05,159
I'm sure Doug has it. We'll get it back.

743
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:08,329
Then I vote we torch the cop car and all this shit with it.

744
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,459
- Torch it? Who are you? - I don't know, Phil.

745
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:16,003
Apparently I'm a guy who marries complete strangers.

746
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:21,175
This whole situation is completely fucked.

747
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:24,971
- These mugs. This hat. This car. - Hey!

748
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:28,141
It's all evidence of a night that never happened.

749
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:30,476
That is why we're torching all of it.

750
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:33,062
Whoa, I'm a schoolteacher, I got a family, okay?

751
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,898
I'm all for secrecy, but I'm not gonna torch a cop car.

752
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,859
- Fine. I'll do it. - Can I help?

753
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:40,653
- Yeah, thanks. - And how exactly are you gonna do that?

754
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,614
Easy. You just pour kerosene over a ferret,

755
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:44,407
light it on both ends, put it in.

756
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,242
They're attracted to the gas lines.

757
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,785
- What? A ferret? - Yeah. Yeah.

758
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:50,496
Or a tamed raccoon, but it's a lot of trouble.

759
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,832
- If you wanna... - Does it matter if it's tamed?

760
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,335
Yeah, because if it's untamed, it won't take the kerosene as well.

761
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,338
- Is it Doug? - I don't have it.

762
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:01,007
It's Doug, it's Doug.

763
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,467
Uh, it's Melissa.

764
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:05,136
- Don't answer. - I have to. She's called twice already!

765
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:06,471
- Can I ride shotgun? - Don't touch me.

766
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:08,639
Hey, sweetheart, how are you?

767
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:12,018
There you are. This is the third time I'm trying you.

768
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:15,188
I know. The reception up here's crazy.

769
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:18,107
I think it's all the sequoia trees, block the signal.

770
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:21,194
Ugh, I hate that. So how was it last night?

771
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:24,322
Ah, it was really fun, actually. It was quiet, but it was a good time.

772
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,032
That sounds nice.

773
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:29,619
I'm learning all kinds of vino factoids. 

774
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,207
It'd be so cool if I could breast-feed, you know?

775
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:35,458
Well, listen...

776
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:39,378
- ...we're about to go for a tractor ride. - What the fuck?

777
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:43,007
- I should get going. So pretty. - A tractor ride?

778
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,260
- Go, out of the car! - What was that?

779
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:48,805
They started up the tractor. I think it backfired.

780
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,140
- Where the hell is he?  - Hey, easy, easy.

781
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,726
I think we're looking for the same guy, okay?

782
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,062
Hey! What the hell, man?

783
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,899
What the fuck, Stu? Is that a baby?

784
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:03,027
Why would there be a baby? We're at a winery. That's a goat.

785
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:06,155
- Where is he? - I don't know! What are you talking about?

786
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:09,325
Sir, can you please start the tractor so we can get out of here?

787
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,410
I'm trying to, but we're fucking blocked.

788
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:14,163
Oh, my God! What the hell is happening, Stu?

789
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:17,667
- Hey! There's a baby on board! - Someone just said "baby."

790
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,919
- Get out of the car! - It's a baby goat.

791
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,213
Why you making trouble for my business, man?

792
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,257
- Go away from here. - Get out of the car!

793
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:26,551
- Phil, he's got a gun! - No shit he's got a gun!

794
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:28,928
- I gotta call you back. Bye. - Come on.

795
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,431
- Fuck! Shit. - He shot me!

796
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,934
- He shot Eddie! - Fuck this shit!

797
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,189
Fuck! Fuck!

798
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:43,234
Go, go, go!

799
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:46,612
Fuck.

800
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,781
Okay. Oh, that was some sick shit!

801
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,200
Who were those guys?

802
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,452
We're gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be okay.

803
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,454
What the fuck is going on?!

804
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:57,623
I have no idea.

805
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,549
Why don't you just let that go to voicemail?

806
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:12,054
That's a fake laugh, by the way.

807
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:19,186
It's got, uh, Ted Danson and Magnum P.I. And that Jewish actor.

808
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:20,980
Shut up, Alan.

809
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:23,566
- What room was it again? - It's 825.

810
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,152
WOI know, I did. I already checked with her.

811
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:30,698
I found him, I'll call you back. Thank God, he's with his father.

812
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:34,827
I was freaking out. I missed you, sweetie.

813
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,330
And I miss you.

814
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:42,543
No.

815
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,921
What the hell happened to you guys?

816
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:46,839
Actually, we were hoping you could tell us.

817
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,926
What do you mean? I got up this morning, I went to get coffee...

818
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,094
...and I came back and you were gone.

819
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:57,642
- Why are you being so quiet? - I'm not being quiet.

820
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,810
Ha, ha. You're so cute.

821
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:03,105
Yeah, I gotta feed Tyler. Come inside, you guys.

822
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:07,443
Did you hear that? Baby's name is Tyler.

823
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,947
Yeah. I thought he looked more like a Carlos too, bud.

824
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:17,870
Okay, what's up? You guys are acting weird.

825
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:20,957
- Look, it's Jade, right? - Very funny, Phil.

826
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,961
Right, Jade, uh, ahem, you remember our friend, Doug.

827
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,963
Are you kidding? He was the best man.

828
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,882
Exactly. Well, we can't find him, and we're getting worried.

829
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:33,052
Oh, my God, that is so Doug.

830
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,808
Oh, sweetie, I'm... I'm gonna go clean him off.

831
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,977
It's all right, Daddy didn't mean it.

832
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,436
Oh, my God.

833
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:44,730
What the fuck, man, you gotta hold it together.

834
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:46,565
- Holy shit. - She is super hot.

835
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,380
You should be proud of yourself.

836
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:50,027
She's wearing my grandmother's ring!

837
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:52,154
- What? - The ring I'm gonna give to Melissa.

838
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,323
You remember, my grandmother's Holocaust ring?

839
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,575
- Fuck. Okay. - She's wearing it.

840
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:59,453
I didn't know they gave out rings at the Holocaust.

841
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:02,623
- He's okay. - Oh, good.

842
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,750
- He was just hungry, he's fine. - Oh, good.

843
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:07,065
About last night, uh, ahem, 

844
00:50:07,065 --> 00:50:09,213
do you remember the last time you saw Doug?

845
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,774
Uh, I haven't seen him since the wedding.

846
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,967
The wedding. Okay. Great.

847
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:16,429
And, uh, we can't re... What time was that at?

848
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:19,098
Well, it was, um...

849
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,894
I guess it was around 1, because I had to

850
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:24,687
go back to work and finish my shift.

851
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,773
And then when I got out I headed over to the hotel with Tyler.

852
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:29,275
And was Doug there then?

853
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,220
I didn't see Doug because you guys were passed out.

854
00:50:31,231 --> 00:50:32,820
The room was a wreck.

855
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:35,114
So I just curled up next to Stu. Uh-huh.

856
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:42,038
I got a question. Um, you said when your shift ended.

857
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:46,459
Does that mean you're a nurse? Or a blackjack dealer?

858
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:49,795
You know this. I'm a stripper. 

859
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,300
Well, technically I'm an escort,

860
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:53,716
but stripping's a great way to meet the clients.

861
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,968
- Smart. - Savvy.

862
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:59,847
But that's all in the past, now that I married a doctor.

863
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,724
I'm just a dentist.

864
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,560
- Las Vegas Police! Freeze! - Okay.

865
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:07,396
Shut that baby up! Shut that baby up!

866
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:10,274
Oh, God! Okay, okay, okay.

867
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:18,491
After we take the mug shots, we bring them down here...

868
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:22,244
...where they wait to be interviewed by the arresting officers.

869
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:25,790
Trust me, kids, you do not wanna be sitting on these benches.

870
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:28,042
We call this place Loserville.

871
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:33,005
Follow me. All right, let's do it. Come on.

872
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,512
Hello.

873
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:42,807
- Hey, Tracy! It's Phil. - Hey, Phil.

874
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:47,186
- Where are you guys? - We are at the spa at the hotel.

875
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:50,272
Cool. We're just getting some sun. Is Doug around?

876
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,149
Of course. Why wouldn't he be?

877
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:54,527
I'm just wondering why you're calling me.

878
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:56,195
Um...

879
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:59,657
We made a deal, no talking to girlfriends or wives.

880
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:03,202
So we're all calling each other's.

881
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,829
Okay. What's up?

882
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:07,018
Uh, you are not gonna believe this.

883
00:52:07,018 --> 00:52:09,041
We got comped an extra night at the hotel.

884
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,209
You did?

885
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:13,170
Yeah. The suite is... It's ridiculous. It's out of control.

886
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:17,299
There's, like, room service and a butler. I mean, just the works.

887
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,343
We're thinking of spending the night...

888
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:21,720
...and we're gonna come back in the morning.

889
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:25,224
You wanna stay an extra night? But the wedding's tomorrow.

890
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,143
That's why we're gonna get up early,

891
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:28,894
and we'll be back in plenty of time.

892
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:31,355
Okay. Are you sure that's a good idea?

893
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:34,233
Wenneck, Price, Garner. Room 3.

894
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,652
Okay, Trace, I gotta go. We'll talk to you later.

895
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:42,449
- Come on, chop-chop. - Okay, spin around.

896
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:44,994
- That's it. - Goddamn it.

897
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,580
- Wait a second. - I'll go over. I'll go over.

898
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:49,665
- Stop pulling. - Can you just...? Hold on.

899
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,585
We got it. Alan, just relax. And then just... There we go.

900
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:54,128
Good.

901
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:01,802
Gentlemen.

902
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,889
We've got some good news, and we've got some bad news.

903
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:06,765
The good news is we found your Mercedes.

904
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,852
- That's great news. - That's great. See?

905
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,230
Yeah, it's over at impound right now. 

906
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,440
We picked it up at 5 a.m. This morning...

907
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,734
...parked in the middle of Las Vegas Boulevard.

908
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:21,697
- In the middle. That's weird. - Yeah, that is weird.

909
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:22,948
There was also a note.

910
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:28,913
It says, uh, "Couldn't find a meter, but here's 4 bucks."

911
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:31,957
The bad news is...

912
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:34,919
...we can't get you in front of a judge until Monday morning.

913
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:39,298
Oh, no, uh, officer, that's just impossible.

914
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,759
No, we need to be in L.A. Tomorrow for a wedding.

915
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:46,847
- You stole a police car. - We didn't steal anything. Um, we found it.

916
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:50,100
Yeah, if anything, we deserve a reward or something, like a trophy.

917
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:54,146
- I see assholes like you every day. - Every fucking day.

918
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,190
"Let's go to Vegas, we'll all get drunk and laid!

919
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:01,654
Let's steal a cop car, because it'd be really fucking funny."

920
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:04,073
Think you gonna get away with it? Not up in here.

921
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:06,325
Not up in here!

922
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:10,913
Sir...

923
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:12,665
...if I may, um...

924
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:15,501
...l'm assuming that that squad car belongs to one of you.

925
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,378
- Yeah. - Yeah.

926
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:19,922
Look, I'm not a cop.

927
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:23,175
I'm no hero. I'm a schoolteacher.

928
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:27,471
But if one of my kids went missing on a field trip...

929
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:30,099
...that would look really bad on me.

930
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:34,311
- What are you getting at? - Yeah, Phil, what are you getting at?

931
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:37,856
No one wants to look bad. We gotta get to a wedding...

932
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:40,276
...and you guys don't need people talking about...

933
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:44,488
...how some obnoxious tourists borrowed your squad car last night.

934
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:47,574
But look, the point is, I think we can work out a deal.

935
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:49,660
Discreetly of course, ma'am.

936
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:51,912
What do you say?

937
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,631
Let me ask you a question:

938
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:08,387
Do, uh, any of you gentlemen have a heart condition or anything like that?

939
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,889
Uh, no.

940
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:13,642
Okay, kids, you're in for a real treat today.

941
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,729
These gentlemen have kindly volunteered to demonstrate...

942
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:19,648
...how a stun gun is used to subdue a suspect.

943
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:22,526
- That's right. - Wait a sec. What?

944
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:25,696
Now, there's two ways to use a stun gun. Up close and personal.

945
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:31,660
- What the fuck? - Or you can shoot it from a distance.

946
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,006
Do I have any volunteers? 

947
00:55:33,006 --> 00:55:35,164
You wanna come up here and do some shooting? Huh?

948
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:38,667
All right, how about you, young lady? Come on up here. All right.

949
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,627
Let's go, handsome, come on.

950
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:43,672
Not you, fat Jesus, slide it on back. You, pretty boy.

951
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:46,342
- Fat Jesus. - All right, now, it's real simple.

952
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:49,261
All you gotta do is point, aim and shoot.

953
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:50,846
All right?

954
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:54,099
Okay, look. You don't really wanna do this.

955
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:56,560
You can do this. Just focus.

956
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:59,229
Don't listen to this maniac. Let's think this through.

957
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:00,731
Finish him!

958
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:03,442
- Oh, fuck. - Yeah!

959
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:07,112
Right in the nuts! That was beautiful.

960
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:12,534
- Well done. Give her a hand, everybody. - Good job. Good job.

961
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:16,747
Good job. Well done. Good job. That was great.

962
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:19,187
Good. Hey, we got one more charge left.

963
00:56:19,187 --> 00:56:21,085
Anybody wanna do some shooting up here?

964
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:25,005
How about you, big man? Come on up here.

965
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:46,110
Okay, same instructions. Just point, aim and shoot.

966
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,782
There you go. That's the stuff.

967
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,158
I like the intensity.

968
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,911
Eye of the tiger. Good.

969
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,101
You're holding 50,000 volts, little man.

970
00:56:58,101 --> 00:57:00,124
Don't be afraid to ride the lightning.

971
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:06,672
In the face! In the face!

972
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:11,301
Oh, he's still up. He's still up.

973
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:13,011
No.

974
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:14,805
All right, everybody relax, take it easy.

975
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:18,976
We've seen it before. He just needs a little extra charge.

976
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,561
There we go.

977
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:25,065
Some of these big boys, you gotta give them two shots.

978
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:28,213
All right, kids, who wants to get their fingerprints done, huh?

979
00:57:28,213 --> 00:57:29,194
Come on, let's go.

980
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:33,407
Fuck those guys, you hear me?

981
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:36,660
That was bullshit. I'm telling everybody we stole a cop car.

982
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:39,705
- They let us go, who cares? - I care!

983
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,312
You can't just do that.

984
00:57:41,312 --> 00:57:44,751
You can't just tase people because you think it's funny.

985
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:47,045
That's police brutality.

986
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:53,051
I'm getting a soda. Do you guys want anything?

987
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:54,553
No.

988
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:01,727
My man doesn't shut up. Jesus Christ.

989
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:05,981
Alan, you okay?

990
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:08,984
I'm just worried.

991
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:12,070
What if something happened to Doug? Something bad.

992
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:13,864
Come on, you can't think like that.

993
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,283
I mean, what if he's dead?

994
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:20,162
I can't afford to lose anybody close to me again. It hurts too much.

995
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:23,916
- I was so upset when my grandpa died. - Oh, I'm s... How'd he die?

996
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:27,544
- World War II. - Died in battle?

997
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:31,089
No, he was skiing in Vermont. It was just during World War II.

998
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:33,300
Alan...

999
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:36,094
- ...Doug is fine. - Well, why hasn't he called?

1000
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:38,722
I don't know, but we're gonna figure it out.

1001
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:43,352
I'll tell you another thing, 6-1 odds our car is beat to shit.

1002
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,561
Stu, not now.

1003
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:47,564
No, how much do you wanna bet it's fucked beyond recognition?

1004
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:49,754
That's enough. Alan's seriously worried, okay?

1005
00:58:49,754 --> 00:58:51,777
Let's not freak him out any more.

1006
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:56,823
Sorry, Alan.

1007
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:58,242
You know what?

1008
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:02,120
We'll search the car for clues and everything's gonna be okay.

1009
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,791
Oh, shit. I can't watch. Just tell me what it looks like.

1010
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:10,128
Not looking. Not looking.

1011
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:14,633
- Wow. All right. - Oh, thank God.

1012
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,468
You see?

1013
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:18,971
It's gonna be all right.

1014
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:27,980
- Anything?  - Hmm, I got a cigar.

1015
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:31,066
Oh, I found, uh... These are some black shoes.

1016
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:33,235
- They women's shoes? - I don't know.

1017
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:37,906
- Whose are those? - I don't know. It's a men's size 6.

1018
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:40,659
- That's weird. - What is this, a snakeskin?

1019
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,327
Oh, come on! Ew!

1020
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:45,163
- That's a used condom, Alan. - Oh, God. Blech!

1021
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:47,457
- Get it out of the car. - Gross, it's wet.

1022
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:50,002
- I don't want the thing. - Hey! Come on.

1023
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:54,339
I got jizz on me. Jesus Christ, guys!

1024
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:57,175
- Get it out. - Fuck!

1025
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:59,344
Oh, my God.

1026
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:03,640
All right, what the fuck, man? We gotta get this shit together, guys!

1027
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:07,853
What was that?

1028
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:09,354
It's in the trunk.

1029
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:13,275
- Doug's in the trunk. - Oh, fuck! Holy shit!

1030
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,360
Holy shit!

1031
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:17,654
- Open it! Open it! Open it! - Okay, okay, okay.

1032
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:19,531
Okay, okay, okay.

1033
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,076
Oh God!

1034
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:26,371
Please! Please! Please stop!

1035
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:36,715
Whoa. I'm with you, I'm with you!

1036
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:39,843
- You gonna fuck on me? - Nobody's gonna fuck on you!

1037
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:44,389
We're on your side. I hate Godzilla! I hate him too. I hate him!

1038
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:47,517
He destroys cities! Please!

1039
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:50,520
This isn't your fault. I'll get you some pants.

1040
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:58,737
What the fuck was that?

1041
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:04,284
I have internal bleeding. Somebody call 911.

1042
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:07,204
That was some fucked up shit.

1043
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:11,041
Who was that guy? He was so mean.

1044
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:15,462
Guys, there's something I need to tell you.

1045
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:20,509
Last night on the roof, before we went out...

1046
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:24,471
...I slipped something in our J?germeister.

1047
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:28,100
- What? - I'm sorry, I fudged up, guys.

1048
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:32,813
- You drugged us? - No, I didn't drug you.

1049
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:35,273
I was told it was ecstasy.

1050
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:37,734
Well, who told you it was ecstasy?

1051
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:39,945
The guy I bought it from at the liquor store.

1052
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,780
Why would you give us ecstasy?

1053
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,699
I wanted everybody to have a good time

1054
01:01:43,699 --> 01:01:45,450
and I knew you guys wouldn't take it.

1055
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:48,620
It was just one hit each. I used to do three hits a night.

1056
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:52,916
But it wasn't ecstasy, Alan, it was roofies!

1057
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:54,543
You think I knew that, Stu?

1058
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:57,963
The guy I bought it from seemed like a real straight shooter.

1059
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:01,091
You mean the drug dealer at the liquor store wasn't a good guy?

1060
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:02,300
Let's just calm down.

1061
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:05,199
You fucking calm down! He drugged us.

1062
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:07,931
I lost a tooth. I married a whore.

1063
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:12,060
- How dare you! She's a nice lady. - You are such a fucking moron.

1064
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:15,063
- Your language is offensive. - Fuck you!

1065
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,649
All right, let's just take a deep breath, okay?

1066
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:19,901
Seriously, this is a good thing.

1067
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:23,989
At least it's not some stranger who drugged us for God knows what reason.

1068
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:27,909
Yeah, you're right, Phil, it's totally a good thing.

1069
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,412
We're so much better off now.

1070
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:34,249
Here's something I would like to remind you two of:

1071
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:38,712
Our best friend Doug is probably facedown in a ditch right now...

1072
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,840
...with a meth-head butt-fucking his corpse.

1073
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:44,134
- That's highly unlikely. - It's true.

1074
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:48,013
Does not help. All right, let's get our shit together, guys.

1075
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:51,433
Let's go back to the hotel, and I'm gonna make a couple calls.

1076
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,602
Maybe Doug's back there. Maybe he's asleep.

1077
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,854
Come on. Let's go.

1078
01:02:56,022 --> 01:03:00,567
- Stu? Little help? - Shut up.

1079
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:06,281
- Oh, God. - Oh, God, are you okay?

1080
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:08,992
- Yeah, I'm fine. - Alan, I'm sorry.

1081
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:21,421
Wait, guys. Guys.

1082
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:23,465
What about the tiger? What if he got out?

1083
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:28,303
Oh, fuck. I keep forgetting about the goddamn tiger.

1084
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:30,222
How the fuck did he get in there?

1085
01:03:30,681 --> 01:03:33,246
I don't know, because I don't remember.

1086
01:03:33,246 --> 01:03:35,811
Shh. Stu. Stu, keep it down.

1087
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:39,397
Because one of the, uh, side effects of, uh, roofies is memory loss.

1088
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,735
You are literally too stupid to insult.

1089
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,780
Thank you.

1090
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:53,453
Hey, come on.

1091
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:58,708
Did we leave the music on?

1092
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:04,798
Don't make any sudden movements.

1093
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:09,344
- Who the hell are you? - No, who are you?

1094
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:10,595
Quiet, quiet.

1095
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,767
Mike Tyson?

1096
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:19,771
Shh. This is my favorite part coming up right now.

1097
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:29,531
Need a chorus line, guys.

1098
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:39,583
One more time, guys.

1099
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:43,044
Oh, Jesus!

1100
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:45,547
Oh, fuck!

1101
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:47,465
Why did you do that?

1102
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:51,970
Mr. Tyson would like to know why is his tiger in your bathroom.

1103
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:54,472
Hold on, that was completely unnecessary.

1104
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,183
I'm a huge fan. When you knocked out Holmes, that was...

1105
01:04:57,351 --> 01:04:59,144
Explain.

1106
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:01,500
All right, look, we were drugged last night.

1107
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,356
We have no memory of what happened.

1108
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:04,566
It's true.

1109
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,464
We got in all kinds of trouble last night

1110
01:05:06,464 --> 01:05:08,194
and now we can't find our friend.

1111
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:11,323
If you wanna kill us, go ahead because I don't care anymore.

1112
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:13,491
- What are you talking about? - I don't care.

1113
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:16,077
Why the fuck would you wanna steal his tiger?

1114
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:19,289
We tend to do dumb shit when we're fucked up.

1115
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:23,168
- I don't believe these guys, man. - Wait, how did you guys find us?

1116
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:25,233
One of you dropped your jacket. 

1117
01:05:25,233 --> 01:05:27,130
Found it in the tigers' cage this morning.

1118
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:28,632
That's Doug's.

1119
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,968
Yeah, Doug. His wallet and his room key is in there.

1120
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:34,971
- No, that's our missing friend. - I don't give a fuck.

1121
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:37,223
- Did you guys see him? - I was fast asleep.

1122
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:40,352
Because if he was up, this wouldn't have gone down so smoothly.

1123
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:42,479
Maybe one of the tigers ate his ass like Omar.

1124
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:44,022
Respect.

1125
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:45,315
Wha... What happened to Omar?

1126
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:47,859
Oh, don't worry about Omar, he's not with us no more.

1127
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:50,278
Okay, I know this is asking a lot...

1128
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:53,406
...but do you think we could go to your house and look around...

1129
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:55,283
...see if there's any clues?

1130
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:59,663
Absolutely. How else you think we're gonna get the tiger back anyway?

1131
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:02,791
- Come on, champ. - I'm sorry?

1132
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:05,377
We're not gonna put it in the Bentley.

1133
01:06:05,377 --> 01:06:07,379
You brought it here, you bring it back.

1134
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:10,006
What you think, about 40 minutes?

1135
01:06:10,424 --> 01:06:12,926
Don't make me come back for him.

1136
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,683
- That was Mike Tyson. - Yeah, no shit that was Mike Tyson.

1137
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:21,559
I'm just saying, he's still got it.

1138
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:24,396
Alan.

1139
01:06:24,563 --> 01:06:25,605
Bud, are you okay?

1140
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:27,190
- Oh, my God. - Shit!

1141
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:28,650
Fuck, where'd he get him?

1142
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:29,859
Hey.

1143
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:36,658
This does not seem fair.

1144
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:40,745
It's Rock, Paper, Scissors. There's nothing more fair.

1145
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:44,207
- Alan should do it. - Alan took a punch from Mike Tyson.

1146
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:46,418
Come on. For Doug.

1147
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:49,838
Why are you peppering the steak? You don't know if tigers like pepper.

1148
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:53,133
Tigers love pepper. They hate cinnamon.

1149
01:06:55,594 --> 01:06:58,388
Phil, just do it. You should do it.

1150
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:01,850
I would, but you lost. It wouldn't be right.

1151
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:04,769
Okay, I jammed five roofies in there.

1152
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:07,397
Just go in there and throw it in to him.

1153
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:09,941
Fine.

1154
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:12,694
Make sure he eats the whole thing.

1155
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:19,951
Fuck.

1156
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:21,911
Oh, fuck.

1157
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:26,499
Hey, kitty.

1158
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:31,046
Hey, sweetie, it's okay. I got a little snack for you.

1159
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:33,798
Real important that you eat this, okay?

1160
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,968
Yeah, just have a little...

1161
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:41,347
Shit!

1162
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:45,185
What do we do now?

1163
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:47,729
We wait.

1164
01:07:57,573 --> 01:08:00,742
 What do tigers dream of

1165
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:04,496
When they take a little tiger snooze?

1166
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:07,874
Do they dream of mauling zebras

1167
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:12,170
Or Halle Berry in her catwoman suit?

1168
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:15,173
Don't you worry your pretty striped head

1169
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:19,219
We're gonna get you back to Tyson And your cozy tiger bed

1170
01:08:19,386 --> 01:08:22,555
And then we're gonna find Our best friend Doug

1171
01:08:22,723 --> 01:08:26,351
And then we're gonna give him A best-friend hug

1172
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:28,103
Doug

1173
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:30,063
Doug

1174
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:34,734
Doug, Dougie, Dougie, Doug, Doug

1175
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:40,031
But if he's been murdered By crystal-meth tweakers

1176
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:44,828
Well, then we're shit out of luck

1177
01:08:50,334 --> 01:08:52,710
By the way, we're all gonna die.

1178
01:08:57,049 --> 01:08:58,466
Wait.

1179
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:03,388
- Oh, God. - Watch it!

1180
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:06,891
His nose. That's his nose.

1181
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:14,566
Please don't stop. Please don't stop.

1182
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:18,236
Please don't... Goddamn it.

1183
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:21,739
I'm gonna beat you! Ha-ha-ha.

1184
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:23,783
Oh... He won again.

1185
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:30,540
- Hey, fellas. Rough night?  - Mm-hm.

1186
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:32,250
Sweetie, stay close to Mama.

1187
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:36,754
What's this?

1188
01:09:36,922 --> 01:09:39,924
Take it easy, little man. You don't wanna be touching that.

1189
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:42,844
No, partner, that's not your property.

1190
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:48,516
So, what do you guys got under there?

1191
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:51,561
Just a whole bunch of "mind your own business."

1192
01:09:51,937 --> 01:09:54,105
- Easy, Phil. - He's correct. My fault.

1193
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:56,441
- You okay? - Aren't we riding an elevator?

1194
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:59,444
Why, is this Jeopardy? What the fuck is this bullshit?

1195
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:03,114
- Please, with the language. - Yes.

1196
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:06,117
I fully agree.

1197
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:16,961
Hey, guys, when's the next Halley's comet?

1198
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:20,924
- Who cares, man? - Do you know, Stu?

1199
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:24,636
I don't think it's for, like, another 60 years or something.

1200
01:10:24,803 --> 01:10:27,764
- But it's not tonight, right? - No, I don't think so.

1201
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:29,849
But you don't know for sure?

1202
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:31,643
No.

1203
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:34,395
I got this cousin who saw one. He said it blew his mind.

1204
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:37,482
I wanna make sure I never, ever miss out on a Halley's Comet.

1205
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,943
So if you guys know if there's gonna be one...

1206
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:41,152
Oh, fuck!

1207
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:02,507
- Oh, my God! - Fuck it!

1208
01:11:03,133 --> 01:11:05,510
Stu! Stu, it got me! Stu!

1209
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:08,137
You got clawed! You're bleeding!

1210
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:12,267
Oh. I'm panicking.

1211
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:14,060
Oh, my God.

1212
01:11:14,561 --> 01:11:16,771
Okay. Okay, okay. Wait, hold on.

1213
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:28,700
I can't do it. Get your fucking hand back in there...

1214
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:30,702
- ...and steer the car. - I'm too nervous.

1215
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:33,579
Alan. We need you, buddy. This is your time to shine, okay?

1216
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:35,707
Okay, yeah. Whew.

1217
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:37,208
Daddy's gonna kill me.

1218
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:39,043
- That's it. - That's good.

1219
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:41,129
Keep it straight.

1220
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:52,223
- You're late. - Whatever, man.

1221
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:54,183
We had to push it the last mile.

1222
01:11:54,351 --> 01:11:57,186
Come on in. Mike's got something he wants to show you.

1223
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:05,486
That thing's out of control, man. Seriously, you gotta put it down.

1224
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:10,742
When we got back, we took a look at the security cameras.

1225
01:12:10,909 --> 01:12:12,035
Great.

1226
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:16,706
This is how you walk. This is how you walk.

1227
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:20,251
- Oh, it's Doug. - Oh, thank God he's alive.

1228
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:23,546
That's our buddy. That's who we've been missing.

1229
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:24,964
We're all best friends.

1230
01:12:25,132 --> 01:12:27,759
Why don't you just pay attention? I don't have all night.

1231
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:29,260
Yeah, of course. Of course.

1232
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:34,015
What are you doing? Hey, guys. Check it out. Watch this.

1233
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:37,769
That's me, I'm on TV. I've never been on TV before.

1234
01:12:37,936 --> 01:12:39,020
What are you doing, man?

1235
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,439
Really? Really, Alan?

1236
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,232
You got a fire hose, man?

1237
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:46,194
Yeah, I was, uh...

1238
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:50,990
You're gonna overflow the pool, man.

1239
01:12:51,992 --> 01:12:55,078
- Maybe... Should I wait outside? - I think that's a good idea, Alan.

1240
01:12:55,287 --> 01:12:56,412
Yeah.

1241
01:12:58,123 --> 01:13:00,083
Don't touch anything out there, either.

1242
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:04,379
You know what? He's not our good fr... We don't know him that well.

1243
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:09,300
Come on. Come on, come on.

1244
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:11,761
By the way, where you get that cop car from?

1245
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:14,764
We, uh, stole it from these dumb-ass cops.

1246
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:16,099
Nice.

1247
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:21,312
High five that one.

1248
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,272
Yeah, that's nice.

1249
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:24,899
You know, I just have to say...

1250
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:28,569
...I have never seen a more beautiful, elegant, just regal creature.

1251
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:31,239
Check it out. Stu. Stu. Fuck this tiger.

1252
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:34,826
- Oh, my God. That's awful. - Oh, man.

1253
01:13:36,203 --> 01:13:38,996
- Oh, shit. - Who does shit like that, man?

1254
01:13:39,873 --> 01:13:43,835
Someone who has a lot of issues, obviously. I'm a sick man.

1255
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,212
Oh, my God.

1256
01:13:47,464 --> 01:13:48,631
That's all we got.

1257
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:52,427
This was hugely helpful.

1258
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:55,513
Really. Because now we know that our buddy Doug...

1259
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:58,599
...was with us at 3:30, totally alive.

1260
01:13:59,059 --> 01:14:01,686
Thanks again, champ. And, uh, again,

1261
01:14:01,686 --> 01:14:04,313
we are so sorry we stole your tiger.

1262
01:14:04,481 --> 01:14:05,690
Don't worry about it, man.

1263
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:08,401
Like you said, we all do dumb shit when we're fucked up.

1264
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:13,698
- I told you he'd get it. - I did say that.

1265
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:20,037
You know, everyone says Mike Tyson is such a badass...

1266
01:14:20,205 --> 01:14:22,874
...but I think he's kind of a sweetheart.

1267
01:14:23,041 --> 01:14:24,959
I think he's mean.

1268
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:28,463
All right. I think it's officially time we call Tracy.

1269
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:32,550
Hallelujah. Finally, Phil says something that makes sense.

1270
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:35,678
We don't have much of a choice. And maybe she's heard from Doug.

1271
01:14:35,846 --> 01:14:37,847
That's what I been saying this whole time.

1272
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:42,351
We just need to be completely honest. We need to tell her everything.

1273
01:14:43,937 --> 01:14:47,023
We don't have to tell her everything. We can leave out the stuff...

1274
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:49,400
...about me marrying a hooker.

1275
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:52,153
Just stay focused on Doug.

1276
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:53,947
What am I gonna tell my dad?

1277
01:14:53,947 --> 01:14:55,573
Alan, relax. It's just the inside.

1278
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:58,576
Come on. I got a guy in L.A. Who's great with interiors.

1279
01:15:09,087 --> 01:15:12,632
- Oh, Jesus! - Oh, my God.

1280
01:15:16,261 --> 01:15:18,554
- Are you guys okay? - What the fuck?

1281
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:30,775
I know that guy. That's the guy from the trunk.

1282
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:34,195
Get out of the car. Please.

1283
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,657
W... W... Wait. Those are the guys that shot Eddie.

1284
01:15:39,117 --> 01:15:40,243
- Listen... - Let's go!

1285
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:42,119
- Okay. - Oh, no.

1286
01:15:42,287 --> 01:15:43,788
- Easy, easy. - Come on.

1287
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:45,540
Okay. All right.

1288
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:47,667
- All right, all right. - Let's go.

1289
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:51,587
Hey, relax. Ow. Ow. Ow!

1290
01:15:51,755 --> 01:15:53,798
- I have whiplash. - Get this other fat boy.

1291
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:55,424
Get the fat boy.

1292
01:15:55,592 --> 01:15:56,634
Hey, hey, hey.

1293
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:59,720
- All right, all right. - Hey, take it easy, take it easy!

1294
01:16:00,305 --> 01:16:04,684
I want my purse back, assholes.

1295
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:08,938
- What? Your purse? - That's not a purse, it's a satchel.

1296
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:13,693
It's a purse. Okay? And you steal from wrong guy.

1297
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:16,571
Wait a second, wait a second. We stole from you?

1298
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:17,822
Okay, you know what?

1299
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:21,367
We don't remember anything that happened last night...

1300
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:23,703
...so help us out a little here.

1301
01:16:23,870 --> 01:16:27,999
Well, apparently you guys met at a craps table late last night.

1302
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:30,501
You were on a heater, and he played your hot streak.

1303
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:32,420
He ended up winning just under 80 grand.

1304
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:34,171
No shit? Eighty grand is nice.

1305
01:16:34,339 --> 01:16:35,423
Okay, that's good.

1306
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:38,843
He put the chips in his purse, and then you guys took off with it.

1307
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:40,720
That doesn't sound like us.

1308
01:16:40,887 --> 01:16:46,601
Mine had $80,000 inside. And this one? Nothing.

1309
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:48,436
Hey, there are Skittles in there.

1310
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:51,022
Ow! Oh, not again.

1311
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:55,067
Don't let the beard fool you. He's a child.

1312
01:16:55,235 --> 01:16:57,194
It's funny because he's fat.

1313
01:16:57,362 --> 01:17:00,823
Now, look, this was obviously a very simple misunderstanding.

1314
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:03,784
Alan picked up the wrong purse, it's no big deal.

1315
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:07,788
Okay, if it's, "No big deal," why, when I come after you guys...

1316
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:11,792
...he starts screaming like crazy and throw me in trunk?

1317
01:17:12,002 --> 01:17:13,044
What, I did that?

1318
01:17:13,211 --> 01:17:15,004
Yeah, you said he was your lucky charm,

1319
01:17:15,004 --> 01:17:16,797
and you want to take him home with you.

1320
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,926
- Lucky charm. - Oh, it's just funny.

1321
01:17:23,096 --> 01:17:24,221
Fuck you.

1322
01:17:25,515 --> 01:17:29,894
If you want to see your friend again, you get me my 80 grand.

1323
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:31,520
- What? - Our friend?

1324
01:17:31,688 --> 01:17:33,814
- You have Doug?  - You know about our friend?

1325
01:17:35,567 --> 01:17:37,526
- Doug! - Doug!

1326
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:41,906
- Doug's in the car! Doug's in the car! - Doug, it's okay!

1327
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:43,866
You chill out, goatee!

1328
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:48,204
- Okay, okay. All right, fine, fine. - What do you want?

1329
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:51,248
Not so good now. Quid pro quo, douche bag.

1330
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:52,541
What?

1331
01:17:52,709 --> 01:17:55,419
Look, we're very sorry. But this is an easy fix.

1332
01:17:55,587 --> 01:17:57,672
- Alan, where's his purse? - I don't know.

1333
01:17:57,839 --> 01:18:00,383
- It's in the hotel room, right? - Yeah, we can get it.

1334
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:03,427
We can get you the... We can even write you a check right now.

1335
01:18:03,595 --> 01:18:05,054
No chance. Cash only.

1336
01:18:05,222 --> 01:18:07,765
- There's a person in there. - Boring.

1337
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:11,143
Take nap. Come on.

1338
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:13,104
Wait. I'm sorry we're boring you!

1339
01:18:13,271 --> 01:18:16,774
- Doug, it's okay. - You kidnapped our friend! Kidnapper!

1340
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:19,235
Wait. Oh, no. You're not going anywhere.

1341
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:21,946
Stop.

1342
01:18:22,447 --> 01:18:24,281
Stop. Run me over.

1343
01:18:24,991 --> 01:18:27,451
Okay. Whoa. Whoa. Stu, Stu, Stu.

1344
01:18:28,912 --> 01:18:33,374
Bring money to Big Rock in Mojave Desert at dawn.

1345
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:37,837
- What? - Toodle-oo, motherfucker.

1346
01:18:40,465 --> 01:18:44,677
Well, at least take the bag off his head! Fuck!

1347
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:58,065
Come on, get out of here.

1348
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:04,594
Guys, I'm telling you,

1349
01:19:04,594 --> 01:19:07,616
I looked for it this morning before we left. It's not anywhere.

1350
01:19:07,784 --> 01:19:09,285
Fuck.

1351
01:19:12,372 --> 01:19:13,998
Stu, how much you got in the bank?

1352
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:16,751
About 10 grand. I was gonna use it for the wedding.

1353
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:19,003
You're already married, so we're good there.

1354
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:21,338
Besides, enough with Melissa, she's the worst.

1355
01:19:21,506 --> 01:19:24,175
Yeah, Doug told me she had sex with a pilot or something.

1356
01:19:24,342 --> 01:19:28,137
It was a bartender on a cruise. What is wrong with you people?

1357
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:32,600
- Ew. Alan, did you just eat sofa pizza? - Yes.

1358
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:35,478
What are we gonna do? We are so fucked.

1359
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:37,480
Hey, guys?

1360
01:19:37,647 --> 01:19:39,690
- Did you find it? - Nope.

1361
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:42,693
But check this out.

1362
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:32,159
Change only, 10,000.

1363
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:39,208
- Hey, uh, these seats taken? - No, feel free.

1364
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:46,590
All right, let's play some blackjack!

1365
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,448
That's it. Shut up, bitches.

1366
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:22,209
- I'll stick. - Oh, fuck you! Fuck you!

1367
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:30,134
Splitting fives.

1368
01:21:31,261 --> 01:21:32,469
- Too many. - Yes!

1369
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:39,643
I don't even know you, but I'm gonna tell you that's dumb.

1370
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:41,979
Yes!

1371
01:21:42,147 --> 01:21:45,482
Okay, come on. He can't lose. He can't lose.

1372
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:48,861
I think the pit boss is watching him.

1373
01:22:06,671 --> 01:22:07,922
- Oh, my God. - Are you okay?

1374
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:11,425
I'm such a klutz. I get so nervous when I gamble. I'm so silly.

1375
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:15,054
- It happens. - Whoa. Hold on a beat, okay?

1376
01:22:15,221 --> 01:22:18,349
- Let's just take it easy. This is my wife. - It's hurting.

1377
01:22:18,516 --> 01:22:20,017
Make sure... Does it hurt? Does this hurt?

1378
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:21,518
You all right?

1379
01:22:21,686 --> 01:22:23,938
- I don't know. - I don't know either. I don't...

1380
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:25,439
I think you're fine. Let's go.

1381
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:28,317
Really? Okay. Upsy-daisy, there.

1382
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:31,445
I'm sorry, she's had a little too much to drink.

1383
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:34,740
- Thanks, buddy. - That's for you.

1384
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:45,834
And 100, 200, 300, 400.

1385
01:22:46,002 --> 01:22:49,546
With all this, that's $82,400.

1386
01:22:49,714 --> 01:22:53,133
- Oh, goddamn it. I don't fucking believe it. - Whoo!

1387
01:22:53,301 --> 01:22:56,220
- Alan, you're the man. - You are too, Phil.

1388
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:59,056
We should come back next week, take the whole city down.

1389
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:00,432
Oh, I'm free next week.

1390
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:04,311
Or we could just focus on getting Doug back, right now.

1391
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:07,731
Uh, you know what? Next week's no good, the Jonas Brothers are in town.

1392
01:23:07,899 --> 01:23:10,484
But any week after that is totally fine.

1393
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:14,071
I think it's safe to say that our luck has officially turned around, guys.

1394
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:19,576
- We are back, baby. We are fucking back. - We're back. Classic.

1395
01:23:19,744 --> 01:23:21,578
We are back, we are back

1396
01:23:21,746 --> 01:23:23,080
That's right.

1397
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:25,582
We are getting Doug back

1398
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:28,919
And we're the three best friends That anybody could have

1399
01:23:29,087 --> 01:23:31,922
We're the three best friends That anyone could have

1400
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:35,592
We're the three best friends That anyone can have

1401
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,762
And we'll never, ever, ever, ever, ever Leave each other

1402
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:41,724
We're the best three friends That anybody could have

1403
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:44,727
I mean, the three best friends That anybody could have

1404
01:23:44,894 --> 01:23:48,022
That's right, the three best friends That anybody can have

1405
01:24:06,082 --> 01:24:08,125
- Now what? - Give him the signal.

1406
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:11,920
- What signal? - Flash your lights. Let him know it's on.

1407
01:24:12,088 --> 01:24:15,007
- What's on? - The deal.

1408
01:24:15,175 --> 01:24:16,051
Of course it's on.

1409
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:18,927
We just drove 30 miles into the desert. He knows it's on.

1410
01:24:19,095 --> 01:24:21,221
Phil, just do something.

1411
01:24:22,432 --> 01:24:23,724
Fine.

1412
01:24:26,811 --> 01:24:28,645
- Oh, shit. - See?

1413
01:24:28,813 --> 01:24:30,814
All right, let's go.

1414
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:46,246
Funny fat guy fall on face.

1415
01:24:46,414 --> 01:24:47,831
You okay?

1416
01:24:47,999 --> 01:24:50,793
All right, we got the money. Eighty grand, cash.

1417
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,128
Throw it over. Then I give you Doug.

1418
01:24:53,296 --> 01:24:55,819
Um, I'm sorry. First of all, good morning.

1419
01:24:55,819 --> 01:24:58,342
And we didn't catch your name last night.

1420
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:01,512
Mr. Chow. Leslie Chow.

1421
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:04,014
Mr. Chow, it is a pleasure. My name is Stu.

1422
01:25:04,182 --> 01:25:08,936
And we would very much appreciate an opportunity to see Doug...

1423
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:12,022
...before we give you the money, just to verify that he's okay.

1424
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:17,486
- Lf that's cool. - Of course, Stu. That is cool.

1425
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:29,540
- Oh, thank God. - Okay.

1426
01:25:29,707 --> 01:25:32,668
See, he fine. Now give me money...

1427
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:36,797
...or I shoot him, and I shoot all you motherfuckers.

1428
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:40,634
And then we take it. Your choice, bitches.

1429
01:25:41,302 --> 01:25:42,803
- Give him the money, Stu. - Okay.

1430
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:55,399
- It's all there. - Let him go.

1431
01:25:58,361 --> 01:26:00,737
All right, take it easy. Take it easy.

1432
01:26:03,908 --> 01:26:05,993
Is this some kind ofjoke? Who the hell is this?

1433
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:07,202
That is not Doug.

1434
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:10,330
What you talking about, Willis? That him.

1435
01:26:10,498 --> 01:26:12,916
No, I'm sorry, Mr. Chow. That's not our friend.

1436
01:26:13,084 --> 01:26:16,128
- He... That's... - The Doug we're looking for is a white.

1437
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:20,883
Ah! I told you you had the wrong guy, little boy.

1438
01:26:21,050 --> 01:26:23,552
Damn, Alan, what the fuck you got me into?

1439
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:26,430
- You know him? - This is the guy that sold me the bad drugs.

1440
01:26:26,598 --> 01:26:29,141
- How you doing? - I didn't sell you no fucking bad drugs.

1441
01:26:29,309 --> 01:26:31,873
Wait. He sold you the Ruphylin? 

1442
01:26:31,873 --> 01:26:34,438
Ruphylin? I sold you that Ru...? Wha...?

1443
01:26:34,606 --> 01:26:38,692
- Who gives a shit? Where is Doug? - I am Doug.

1444
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:41,195
- Your name's Doug? - Yes, I'm Doug.

1445
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:44,072
His name's Doug too. Ha. Classic mix-up.

1446
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:45,407
Come on.

1447
01:26:45,575 --> 01:26:49,786
- Hey, Chow. You gave us the wrong Doug. - Not my problem.

1448
01:26:49,954 --> 01:26:51,000
No, fuck that shit.

1449
01:26:51,009 --> 01:26:53,624
Now, you give us our 80 grand back and take him with you!

1450
01:26:53,791 --> 01:26:56,126
No. Come on. I'll be your Doug.

1451
01:26:56,126 --> 01:26:58,462
Oh, yeah, okay. Oh, I take him back.

1452
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:01,548
Right after you suck on these little Chinese nuts.

1453
01:27:01,925 --> 01:27:04,968
- Ah. That's nasty. - Mmm. How that sound?

1454
01:27:06,846 --> 01:27:10,849
- So long, gay boys. - Wait a second.

1455
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:12,768
He's a nasty little motherfucker.

1456
01:27:12,936 --> 01:27:14,061
Did you ever get any ecstasy?

1457
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:16,313
No, I ain't got no fucking ecstasy.

1458
01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:19,691
- Goddamn it! - Gosh darn it!

1459
01:27:19,859 --> 01:27:22,986
- Shit! - Shoot!

1460
01:27:32,497 --> 01:27:34,665
- Hello? - Ahem, Tracy, it's Phil.

1461
01:27:34,832 --> 01:27:38,460
Phil, where the hell are you guys? I'm freaking out.

1462
01:27:38,628 --> 01:27:40,337
Yeah, listen.

1463
01:27:42,757 --> 01:27:44,341
We fucked up.

1464
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:46,760
Thanks for the lift back to town.

1465
01:27:48,429 --> 01:27:50,180
- I got a question for you. - What's up?

1466
01:27:50,348 --> 01:27:52,182
How did you wind up in Chow's car?

1467
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:55,269
That crazy asshole kidnapped me yesterday.

1468
01:27:55,436 --> 01:27:57,646
Okay, but why? I mean, why you?

1469
01:27:57,814 --> 01:27:59,565
He thought I was with you guys because

1470
01:27:59,565 --> 01:28:01,316
we were hanging over at the Bellagio.

1471
01:28:01,484 --> 01:28:03,193
- What? - We were at the Bellagio?

1472
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:05,320
We were shooting craps. You don't remember?

1473
01:28:05,488 --> 01:28:07,823
No. No, we don't remember.

1474
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:10,534
Because some dick drug dealer sold him

1475
01:28:10,534 --> 01:28:13,078
Ruphylin and told him it was ecstasy.

1476
01:28:13,246 --> 01:28:15,414
Ruphylin. There you go with that word.

1477
01:28:15,414 --> 01:28:17,582
Ruphylin. What the hell is a Ruphylin?

1478
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:22,004
Wow, you are the world's shittiest drug dealer.

1479
01:28:22,171 --> 01:28:24,902
Ruphylin, for your information, 

1480
01:28:24,902 --> 01:28:27,634
is the date-rape drug. You sold Alan roofies.

1481
01:28:27,802 --> 01:28:31,346
Oh, shit. I must have mixed up the bags. My fault, Alan.

1482
01:28:31,514 --> 01:28:34,558
Damn, Marshall gonna be pissed off at me on that one.

1483
01:28:35,059 --> 01:28:38,103
- Whatever. - It's funny, because just the other day...

1484
01:28:38,271 --> 01:28:41,481
...me and my boy, we was wondering why they even call them roofies.

1485
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:44,651
- You know what I'm talking about? - No. Don't know.

1486
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:47,279
Why not floories, right? Because when you take them...

1487
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:50,615
...you're more likely to end up on the floor than the roof.

1488
01:28:50,950 --> 01:28:54,244
What about groundies? That's a good new name for them.

1489
01:28:54,412 --> 01:28:55,871
Or, how about rapies?

1490
01:28:56,497 --> 01:28:58,957
- Wait, what did you just say? - Rapies.

1491
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:02,836
Not you. Doug, what did you say before?

1492
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:04,046
I said groundies.

1493
01:29:04,213 --> 01:29:09,676
No, before that.

1494
01:29:09,844 --> 01:29:12,596
You said, "You're more likely to wind up on the floor than..."

1495
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:14,681
- Phil. - Listen, Trace, I'm really sorry. L...

1496
01:29:14,849 --> 01:29:17,726
- Phil? Hello? - Tracy, it's Stu.

1497
01:29:17,894 --> 01:29:20,103
Stu. Talk to me. What's going on?

1498
01:29:20,271 --> 01:29:22,230
Uh, nothing. Don't listen to Phil.

1499
01:29:22,398 --> 01:29:24,128
He's completely out of his mind.

1500
01:29:24,128 --> 01:29:25,859
He's probably still drunk from last night.

1501
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:27,069
Where's Doug?

1502
01:29:27,236 --> 01:29:30,530
He is paying the bill. We just had a delicious brunch.

1503
01:29:30,698 --> 01:29:33,116
We're in a hurry to get back, so we gotta get going.

1504
01:29:33,284 --> 01:29:35,452
- Okay, we'll see you soon. Bye. - Stu.

1505
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:37,788
Stu. Fuck.

1506
01:29:37,955 --> 01:29:41,625
- What the fuck, man? - I know where Doug is.

1507
01:29:48,341 --> 01:29:50,050
I don't know, man. It just hit me.

1508
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:53,136
You remember when we saw Doug's mattress impaled on that statue?

1509
01:29:53,304 --> 01:29:55,639
- Yeah, we threw it out the window. - No, impossible.

1510
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:57,900
You can't open windows in Vegas hotels. 

1511
01:29:57,900 --> 01:29:59,351
Well, then how did it get...?

1512
01:29:59,519 --> 01:30:01,728
- Oh, my God! - Ha, ha, ha.

1513
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:04,940
- Whoa, wait. What's going on? - Doug was trying to signal someone.

1514
01:30:05,108 --> 01:30:06,566
- Holy shit. - Yes.

1515
01:30:06,734 --> 01:30:09,611
- Wait. How did you figure that out? - Doug made me realize it.

1516
01:30:09,779 --> 01:30:11,655
- Doug? - Uh, not our Doug. Black Doug.

1517
01:30:11,823 --> 01:30:14,991
- Hey, hey, easy with that shit. Come on. - Sorry.

1518
01:30:15,159 --> 01:30:16,993
Can someone tell me where white Doug is?

1519
01:30:17,161 --> 01:30:18,745
- He's on the roof, Alan. - Yes.

1520
01:30:18,913 --> 01:30:22,124
He's on the roof. We must have taken him up there as a prank...

1521
01:30:22,291 --> 01:30:25,210
- ...so he'd wake up on the roof. - Like that time in summer camp.

1522
01:30:25,378 --> 01:30:27,504
We moved his sleeping bag out in the jetty at the lake?

1523
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:29,423
Ha, ha, ha. Which was hilarious.

1524
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:31,133
It's not so funny now, though,

1525
01:30:31,133 --> 01:30:32,676
because we forgot where we put him.

1526
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:34,678
You guys are retarded, you know that?

1527
01:30:34,846 --> 01:30:37,056
Holy shit. You think he's still up there?

1528
01:30:37,056 --> 01:30:39,266
There's only one way to find out.

1529
01:30:43,855 --> 01:30:45,188
Doug!

1530
01:30:45,356 --> 01:30:47,190
Doug!

1531
01:30:47,358 --> 01:30:49,484
- Doug!  - Doug, you up here, buddy?

1532
01:30:53,656 --> 01:30:55,699
Where you at, Doug?

1533
01:30:57,368 --> 01:30:58,994
Doug!

1534
01:31:02,707 --> 01:31:03,748
Hey, guys!

1535
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:06,293
He's over here!

1536
01:31:08,004 --> 01:31:11,548
- Hey, I found him! He's over here! - Oh, shit.

1537
01:31:14,051 --> 01:31:15,343
He's okay.

1538
01:31:15,845 --> 01:31:17,512
You're okay. Ha, ha, ha!

1539
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:20,682
Oh, God. We gotta go, buddy. Come on.

1540
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:23,852
Oh, we have been looking everywhere for you.

1541
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:27,105
- He's alive. - What the fuck is going on?

1542
01:31:27,273 --> 01:31:30,317
We can explain everything, but right now we gotta go.

1543
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:34,529
- Hey, bud. You okay? - No. Not okay.

1544
01:31:34,697 --> 01:31:37,449
You look good, you got some color. I'm jealous.

1545
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:40,076
- I'm getting married today. - Yes, you are.

1546
01:31:40,244 --> 01:31:42,787
That's why you need to focus and do everything we say.

1547
01:31:42,955 --> 01:31:46,291
Because, frankly, you're wasting a little bit of time right now.

1548
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:47,751
You fucking asshole!

1549
01:31:51,005 --> 01:31:52,714
Oh, my skin burns. My skin burns.

1550
01:31:52,882 --> 01:31:54,591
Oh, ow! God.

1551
01:31:54,759 --> 01:31:58,011
- It's okay. It's not your fault, Doug. - Don't touch me. Shut up.

1552
01:31:58,179 --> 01:31:59,596
All of you, shut up.

1553
01:32:00,556 --> 01:32:02,098
Just get me home.

1554
01:32:02,266 --> 01:32:03,391
Mm-hm.

1555
01:32:03,559 --> 01:32:05,352
Just get me home.

1556
01:32:06,062 --> 01:32:08,438
What about the one after that?

1557
01:32:08,648 --> 01:32:11,733
You cannot be serious.

1558
01:32:12,443 --> 01:32:13,985
Oh, goddamn it.

1559
01:32:14,153 --> 01:32:15,946
- What? - Every flight to L.A. Is booked.

1560
01:32:16,113 --> 01:32:17,489
- What about Burbank? - Sold out.

1561
01:32:17,657 --> 01:32:19,366
Oh, fuck! We can't drive there,

1562
01:32:19,366 --> 01:32:21,076
the wedding starts in three and a half hours.

1563
01:32:21,244 --> 01:32:23,453
- Alan, where's the car?  - It's on its way.

1564
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:24,955
You know what?

1565
01:32:25,122 --> 01:32:28,416
We can drive there. We can make it. Okay?

1566
01:32:30,044 --> 01:32:31,127
Hi.

1567
01:32:32,088 --> 01:32:35,924
- Just give me one second.  - We will leave without you.

1568
01:32:38,469 --> 01:32:40,595
- Is he missing a tooth? - Yeah.

1569
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:44,558
- Hey. - Hey.

1570
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:47,477
Hey, thanks for helping out last night. That was so awesome.

1571
01:32:47,645 --> 01:32:49,229
Sure.

1572
01:32:50,064 --> 01:32:52,524
Listen, Jade, l...

1573
01:32:52,692 --> 01:32:55,527
Look, you don't have to say it. I totally understand.

1574
01:32:55,695 --> 01:32:58,822
- This whole thing was stupid. - Huh.

1575
01:33:00,157 --> 01:33:01,783
It was stupid, wasn't it?

1576
01:33:08,916 --> 01:33:10,834
- This is yours. - Oh, thank you.

1577
01:33:12,003 --> 01:33:14,004
I can't believe I gave my grandmother's

1578
01:33:14,004 --> 01:33:16,006
Holocaust ring to someone I just met.

1579
01:33:16,173 --> 01:33:18,842
- What was I thinking? - You were really fucked up.

1580
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:20,719
Clearly.

1581
01:33:21,721 --> 01:33:24,389
- You did pull out your own tooth. - L...?

1582
01:33:25,099 --> 01:33:26,182
I pulled out my tooth?

1583
01:33:27,476 --> 01:33:29,811
Why did I pull out my own tooth?

1584
01:33:29,979 --> 01:33:32,439
Alan bet you that you weren't a good enough dentist...

1585
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:34,024
...to pull out your own tooth.

1586
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:37,819
Okay. Heh.

1587
01:33:38,195 --> 01:33:41,364
- Of course he did. - You won.

1588
01:33:41,532 --> 01:33:44,951
Yeah. Clearly. Yeah.

1589
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:47,037
That's victory, right there.

1590
01:33:47,204 --> 01:33:48,913
It needs to go down.

1591
01:33:49,081 --> 01:33:50,832
- It's good. Get in. - No. Safety first.

1592
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:54,502
- Alan, it's fine. It's down. - No, I gotta get it down first.

1593
01:33:54,670 --> 01:33:58,798
- Jesus Christ. Look out. - Don't mess the car up.

1594
01:33:58,966 --> 01:34:00,884
You're gonna mess the car up.

1595
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:04,638
- Hey, what are you doing next weekend? - I don't know. Working. Why?

1596
01:34:04,805 --> 01:34:07,849
I was thinking maybe I'd come back and take you out to dinner.

1597
01:34:08,017 --> 01:34:10,560
Really? Like a date?

1598
01:34:10,728 --> 01:34:15,482
Yeah. Like a date. Only, one that hopefully I'll remember.

1599
01:34:15,983 --> 01:34:17,734
Sounds good.

1600
01:34:21,197 --> 01:34:24,074
- Stu. Come on. - Stu. Come on.

1601
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:29,537
I gotta go. Okay. Bye.

1602
01:34:32,249 --> 01:34:34,250
- Bye. - Bye.

1603
01:34:36,379 --> 01:34:38,171
All right, here we go.

1604
01:34:38,673 --> 01:34:41,591
- All right, let's go. - Yeah.

1605
01:34:41,759 --> 01:34:42,759
Careful.

1606
01:34:59,902 --> 01:35:02,570
At least the trip wasn't a total disaster.

1607
01:35:02,738 --> 01:35:05,907
- What makes you say that? - When I woke up on the roof...

1608
01:35:06,075 --> 01:35:09,953
...I happened to find $80,000 worth of Bellagio chips in my pocket.

1609
01:35:10,121 --> 01:35:11,871
Oh! Oh, my God!

1610
01:35:12,331 --> 01:35:15,834
Looks like we're going home with some money, boys.

1611
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:35,145
Here he comes. That's him.

1612
01:35:37,356 --> 01:35:40,316
- Hey, Neeco! - Hey. What's up, Alan?

1613
01:35:40,484 --> 01:35:42,152
Whoo!

1614
01:35:43,612 --> 01:35:45,280
- Whoa, look out. - Oh, shit.

1615
01:35:45,448 --> 01:35:47,449
Whoa! Whoa!

1616
01:35:50,828 --> 01:35:52,120
- Thanks, Neeco. - You got it, man.

1617
01:35:52,288 --> 01:35:53,705
- Page me! - Adios.

1618
01:35:54,123 --> 01:35:56,332
- Who the hell was that guy? - That's my buddy.

1619
01:36:32,536 --> 01:36:37,373
Hey. Sorry, MapQuest took us on a really crazy route.

1620
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:01,564
- How's my hair? - It looks good.

1621
01:37:01,732 --> 01:37:05,902
- Is it cool like Phil's? - It's classic Phil.

1622
01:37:10,533 --> 01:37:12,575
She looks beautiful, man.

1623
01:37:18,999 --> 01:37:20,208
Sorry I'm late.

1624
01:37:21,752 --> 01:37:23,294
Vegas.

1625
01:37:28,050 --> 01:37:31,970
Where were you? And why are you so red?

1626
01:37:32,429 --> 01:37:36,307
Honey, it's a long story.

1627
01:37:37,226 --> 01:37:39,185
We are gathered here today...

1628
01:37:39,353 --> 01:37:42,939
...because of the strength of love and of promises kept.

1629
01:37:43,107 --> 01:37:46,317
All I know is I am so sorry.

1630
01:37:46,652 --> 01:37:49,028
And I promise for as long as we're married...

1631
01:37:49,196 --> 01:37:53,491
...to never, ever put you through anything like this again.

1632
01:37:54,618 --> 01:37:56,494
Can you forgive me?

1633
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:44,334
- Daddy. - Hey, my man.

1634
01:38:44,501 --> 01:38:46,878
Excuse me, but I'm expecting my husband any minute.

1635
01:38:47,046 --> 01:38:48,922
Oh, that's very funny. Come here.

1636
01:38:50,299 --> 01:38:51,382
How was your soccer game?

1637
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:12,487
- Stu? You avoiding me? - Hey. Melissa.

1638
01:39:12,655 --> 01:39:15,365
Oh, my God. What happened to your tooth?

1639
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:19,702
Have you met Alan? Tracy's brother. Brother of the...

1640
01:39:19,870 --> 01:39:21,454
Okay. Ow.

1641
01:39:21,622 --> 01:39:24,540
That is disgusting. Why haven't you returned my calls?

1642
01:39:25,125 --> 01:39:27,043
Well, there was a snafu when we stopped...

1643
01:39:27,211 --> 01:39:29,087
I called that bed and breakfast in Napa.

1644
01:39:29,254 --> 01:39:32,423
They said they had no record of you even checking in.

1645
01:39:33,133 --> 01:39:34,842
That's because we didn't go to Napa.

1646
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:37,011
Stu. What the fuck is going on?

1647
01:39:37,011 --> 01:39:39,013
We went to Las Vegas.

1648
01:39:39,181 --> 01:39:42,308
Oh, really? Las Vegas? Why would you go to Las Vegas?

1649
01:39:42,476 --> 01:39:45,019
My friend was getting married. That's what guys do.

1650
01:39:45,187 --> 01:39:46,938
- Okay, that's not what you do. - Really?

1651
01:39:47,106 --> 01:39:49,336
Well, then why did I do it, huh?

1652
01:39:49,336 --> 01:39:51,567
Because I did it. Riddle me that.

1653
01:39:51,735 --> 01:39:53,236
Why'd I do it?

1654
01:39:53,404 --> 01:39:55,613
All you want me to do is what you want me to do.

1655
01:39:55,781 --> 01:39:57,657
I'm sick of doing what you want.

1656
01:39:57,825 --> 01:40:01,369
In a healthy relationship, a guy should be able to do what he wants.

1657
01:40:01,537 --> 01:40:04,580
- That is not how this works!  - Oh, good.

1658
01:40:04,748 --> 01:40:07,750
Because whatever this is ain't working for me!

1659
01:40:07,918 --> 01:40:08,960
- Oh, really?  - Yeah.

1660
01:40:09,128 --> 01:40:10,253
Since when?

1661
01:40:10,421 --> 01:40:14,966
Since you fucked that waiter on your cruise last June. Boom!

1662
01:40:17,886 --> 01:40:19,741
You told me it was a bartender.

1663
01:40:19,741 --> 01:40:21,597
Oh, you're right. I stand corrected.

1664
01:40:21,765 --> 01:40:24,934
It was a bartender. You fucked a bartender.

1665
01:40:25,102 --> 01:40:26,519
You're an idiot.

1666
01:40:26,687 --> 01:40:27,729
You're... You...

1667
01:40:29,773 --> 01:40:31,274
You're such a bad person.

1668
01:40:31,442 --> 01:40:33,443
Like, all the way through to your core.

1669
01:40:35,779 --> 01:40:38,656
Alan, shall we dance?

1670
01:40:39,783 --> 01:40:40,825
Let's do this.

1671
01:40:49,626 --> 01:40:52,295
- It was a real pleasure meeting you. - Fuck off.

1672
01:40:52,921 --> 01:40:56,049
- I'm getting my bartender's license. - Suck my dick.

1673
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,176
No, thank you.

1674
01:41:08,312 --> 01:41:09,312
You guys are awe...

1675
01:41:10,689 --> 01:41:12,648
- Sid? - There he is.

1676
01:41:12,983 --> 01:41:16,819
- You wanted to see me? - Yeah.

1677
01:41:16,987 --> 01:41:19,322
- Congratulations, buddy. - Congratulations to you.

1678
01:41:19,490 --> 01:41:22,366
- You had us worried there for a second. - Sorry.

1679
01:41:22,534 --> 01:41:23,659
How was Vegas?

1680
01:41:23,952 --> 01:41:26,829
It was... Ahem. It was crazy.

1681
01:41:26,997 --> 01:41:28,581
Attaboy.

1682
01:41:32,336 --> 01:41:34,879
- Enjoy the car? - Mm-hm.

1683
01:41:35,923 --> 01:41:39,842
- Remember to put Armor All on the tires? - Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

1684
01:41:43,097 --> 01:41:44,806
Let me ask you a question.

1685
01:41:49,103 --> 01:41:52,313
How can a cake cost $1400?

1686
01:41:54,525 --> 01:41:57,568
- Highway robbery. - It's criminal.

1687
01:41:58,028 --> 01:42:00,988
Sid, ahem, about the car...

1688
01:42:07,663 --> 01:42:11,833
Tracy told you. I told her not to tell you. I wanted to tell you.

1689
01:42:14,294 --> 01:42:17,713
- Tell me what? - Careful, Doug. These women...

1690
01:42:18,549 --> 01:42:19,715
...can't be trusted.

1691
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:24,178
- Tell me what, Sid? - The Mercedes.

1692
01:42:24,346 --> 01:42:26,722
It is a wedding gift from Linda and I.

1693
01:42:28,433 --> 01:42:30,726
- Are you serious? - What do you think?

1694
01:42:40,904 --> 01:42:42,405
That is awesome.

1695
01:42:44,116 --> 01:42:45,867
Thank you. Oh.

1696
01:42:48,078 --> 01:42:50,788
Thanks, Daddy. Thanks, Sid.

1697
01:42:50,956 --> 01:42:53,332
- Close the door. - You're awesome.

1698
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:55,376
You are awesome.

1699
01:42:57,087 --> 01:42:58,504
Yeah.

1700
01:43:06,597 --> 01:43:07,889
Dougie...

1701
01:43:08,056 --> 01:43:10,516
...I gotta tell you, man, this was a gorgeous wedding.

1702
01:43:10,684 --> 01:43:13,603
- I give it six months. - You're a dick.

1703
01:43:14,605 --> 01:43:18,983
I don't know what to say. Thanks for the bachelor party, I guess?

1704
01:43:19,776 --> 01:43:24,113
Yeah. I just wish we could actually remember some of it.

1705
01:43:24,281 --> 01:43:27,658
- Hey, guys? Look what I found. - Whoa, that's my camera.

1706
01:43:27,826 --> 01:43:29,389
It was in the back seat of the car.

1707
01:43:29,389 --> 01:43:30,953
Oh, Go... Are there photos on it?

1708
01:43:31,121 --> 01:43:33,456
Yeah. Some of it's even worse than we thought.

1709
01:43:33,624 --> 01:43:35,666
- No fucking way. Give me that. - Wa... Wa... Wait.

1710
01:43:35,834 --> 01:43:38,336
Wait, wait, wait.

1711
01:43:40,797 --> 01:43:45,343
We look at these pictures together, okay? One time.

1712
01:43:45,802 --> 01:43:49,972
- And then we delete the evidence. - I say we delete it right now.

1713
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:53,809
Are you nuts? I wanna find out how I wound up in the hospital.

1714
01:43:53,977 --> 01:43:57,980
- Yeah, it's in there. - Guys, one time.

1715
01:43:58,148 --> 01:43:59,190
- Deal? - Deal.

1716
01:43:59,358 --> 01:44:01,025
- Deal. - Okay.

1717
01:44:05,489 --> 01:44:07,031
Oh, dear Lord!

1718
01:44:07,199 --> 01:44:08,407
That's classic!
