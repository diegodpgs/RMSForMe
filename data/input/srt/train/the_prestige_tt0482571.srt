1
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,767
<i>Are you watching closely?

2
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:10,111
<i>Every magic trick
consists of three parts or acts.

3
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,657
<i>The first part is called the Pledge.

4
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:17,077
<i>The magician shows you
something ordinary...

5
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:20,580
<i>... a deck of cards, a bird, or a man.

6
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,631
<i>He shows you this object...

7
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,800
<i>... perhaps he asks you to inspect it...

8
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:35,595
<i>... to see that it is, indeed, real.

9
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,890
<i>Yeah, unaltered, normal.

10
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:45,105
<i>But of course, it probably isn't.

11
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:49,359
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm part of the bloody act, you fool.

12
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,791
<i>The second act is called the Turn.

13
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,225
<i>The magician takes
the ordinary something...

14
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:27,022
<i>... and makes it
do something extraordinary.

15
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:35,405
<i>Now, you're looking for the secret,
but you won't find it...

16
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,867
<i>... because, of course,
you're not really looking.

17
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,161
<i>You don't really wanna know.

18
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,750
<i>You want to be fooled.

19
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,378
<i>But you wouldn't clap yet...

20
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:55,175
<i>... because making something
disappear isn't enough.

21
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,095
<i>You have to bring it back.

22
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:04,100
<i>That's why every magic trick
has a third act.

23
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,852
<i>The hardest part.

24
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:09,856
<i>The part we call the Prestige.

25
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,953
<i>The Prestige. And did Robert Angier

26
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,746
the Great Danton, your employer

27
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,582
get to that final part
of his trick that night?

28
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,544
- No, sir. Something went wrong.
- What went wrong?

29
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,214
I saw someone
making their way below stage.

30
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,091
I followed him.

31
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:39,511
It was Borden,
watching Mr. Angier drown.

32
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:42,931
 Would you please describe
your occupation to the jury, Mr. Cutter?

33
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,182
<i>I'm an ingénieur.

34
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:48,687
I design illusions and construct the
apparatus necessary for performing them.

35
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:49,896
So, Mr. Cutter

36
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,233
was this water-filled tank
beneath the stage

37
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,152
part of Mr. Angier's illusion?

38
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,444
No, no. It was...

39
00:03:56,611 --> 00:04:00,782
The tank was brought on for the first
trick and then taken off-stage.

40
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:04,119
Borden must have placed it
under the trap door after the interval.

41
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:05,704
How large was this tank?

42
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:10,459
Oh, it's a normal tank for escape
underwater, about 4 or 500 gallons.

43
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,002
How do you think Mr. Borden

44
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,630
was able to move the tank under
the trap door without anyone noticing?

45
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,591
He's a magician. Ask him.

46
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,427
I ask again that this man explain

47
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,304
the mechanics of Mr. Angier's illusion.

48
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:23,972
The Real Transported Man

49
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,142
is one of the most sought-after
illusions in this business.

50
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,810
I have the right to sell it on.

51
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,563
If I reveal the method here,
then the trick is worthless.

52
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,775
How can we know that the tank wasn't
some part of the trick that went wrong?

53
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,612
Mr. Cutter, I see your predicament

54
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,031
but Alfred Borden's life
hangs in the balance.

55
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,326
If you were prepared to disclose
the details to me in private

56
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:47,078
I might be able to judge
their relevance to the case.

57
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,831
Might this be
an acceptable compromise?

58
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,436
I'm gonna have to ask you
to turn out your pockets.

59
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,025
Not my idea, sir.

60
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,444
The warden saw his show
in Manchester last year

61
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,196
where he vanished into thin air.

62
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:24,324
He's convinced he'll try and escape.

63
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,996
I told him the only way
that Borden's gonna disappear

64
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,333
is if I leave him out there
with the other inmates.

65
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,673
Check the locks.

66
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,510
Twice.

67
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,561
My name is Owens.

68
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,896
I'm a solicitor.

69
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:58,733
I represent Lord Caldlow, accomplished
amateur magician and historian...

70
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,610
How much?

71
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,780
- Lord Caldlow is interested...
- How much for my tricks?

72
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,240
Five thousand pounds.

73
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,909
Talk with Fallon, my ingénieur.
Money's for him.

74
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,746
Yes, I did.
He offered to sell me your tricks.

75
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,624
All except the most valuable one:
The Transported Man.

76
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,961
Well, I wouldn't forgive myself
for selling my greatest trick.

77
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:19,421
Even for your daughter?

78
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,800
If the newspapers are right
and you are for the drop

79
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:27,345
your daughter will need looking after.
- Fallon will take care of her.

80
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,932
Bernard Fallon? A man with a past
almost as obscure as your own.

81
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,727
Courts motioned that the girl
be removed from his care.

82
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,313
No, the girl will be an orphan.

83
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:41,359
I know you're no stranger to
the workhouse. It's better than here?

84
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,571
I'm offering you a way
to wrap up your affairs with dignity.

85
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,615
And I'm offering your daughter
a future.

86
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:50,410
As Lord Caldlow's ward,
she will want for nothing. Ever.

87
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,498
Well, think it over.

88
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:59,628
And Lord Caldlow would like you
to have this as a show of good faith.

89
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:03,173
He said it might be of interest.
This is Robert Angier's diary.

90
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,092
Including the time he spent
in Colorado learning your trick.

91
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,803
- He never learned my trick.
- Really?

92
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,473
On his return from Colorado, he mounted
a version of The Transported Man

93
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,477
that the papers said
was better even than your original.

94
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:22,025
If you want Angier's secrets,
you go dig him up and ask him yourself.

95
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:25,153
I want your secret, Mr. Borden.

96
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,657
Consider your daughter.

97
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:40,210
<i>A cipher. An enigma.

98
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:46,758
<i>A search. A search for answers.

99
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:56,476
<i>Even if Colorado
is the end of my journey...

100
00:07:56,643 --> 00:08:02,357
<i>... it'll take much longer to unravel
the rest of Borden's secrets.

101
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:08,530
<i>See, the cipher in his notebook
is unlocked by a single word...

102
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:14,494
<i>but it will still take months to translate
his writing and to know his mind.

103
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:20,667
<i>Well, my passion is equal to the task.

104
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:36,516
Mr. Angier?
Welcome to Colorado Springs.

105
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:55,118
- The whole town has electricity.
- Yes, sir.

106
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:14,846
Well, quite a reception.

107
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,390
You're our first guest of the season,
Mr. Angier.

108
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,936
Your telegram didn't indicate
how long you'll be staying with us.

109
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,604
For as long as it takes.

110
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,941
I'll need a coach tomorrow
to take me up the mountain.

111
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,653
Well, the peak is closed, sir,
for scientific experimentation.

112
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,073
Yes, I know. That's why I'm here.

113
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,671
You'll have to walk the rest,
I'm afraid, sir.

114
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:28,545
I'm amazed how many of you
newspaper writers can't read my sign.

115
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,469
Not the welcome I was expecting.

116
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,474
I know you.

117
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:49,024
You're the Great Danton.
I saw your show in London seven times.

118
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:53,487
You guessed every object
the audience had in their pockets.

119
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,030
I'm Alley.

120
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:57,657
Sorry about the fence.
People interfere with our work.

121
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,368
- I've come to see Tesla.
- Why?

122
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:04,372
He made a machine
for a colleague of mine some time ago.

123
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:08,043
- Can you get me a meeting with him?
- Impossible, I'm afraid.

124
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,378
I brought a lot of money.

125
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,088
I'm sorry, Mr. Angier.

126
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,134
I simply can't help you.

127
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,597
I'll be staying at the hotel.
Indefinitely.

128
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:24,684
Hey, what am I holding?

129
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,853
Your watch.

130
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,070
<i>Borden's journal entry
for April 3rd, 1897...

131
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:37,364
<i>... describes a show
at the Orpheum Theater.

132
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:41,368
<i>That was just days
after he first met me.

133
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:46,414
We were two young men
<i>at the start of a great career.

134
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:49,084
<i>Two young men devoted to an illusion.

135
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:51,419
<i>Two young men
who never intended to hurt anyone.

136
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:56,091
Which of you brave souls is
willing to bind this lovely young woman?

137
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,771
If you would tie her wrists.

138
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:15,402
Bind her feet around the ankle.

139
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,571
Are either of you
two gentlemen sailors?

140
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,447
- No.
- No.

141
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:23,743
 I'm sure you can both
tie a strong knot.

142
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:30,101
He's complacent,
he's predictable, he's boring.

143
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,854
I mean, Milton has gotten success,
whatever that means

144
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,816
and now he's scared.
He won't take any risks at all.

145
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,693
I mean, he's squandering
the goodwill of the audience

146
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,822
with tired, second-rate tricks.
- They're old favorites.

147
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:45,367
Favorites? Give me something fresh.
He won't even try a bullet catch.

148
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:47,119
A bullet catch is suicide.

149
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:51,206
All it takes is some smart-ass volunteer
to put a button in the barrel.

150
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:53,708
- Fine. Use a plant.
- You can't for every trick.

151
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,711
- There'd be no seats left for the punters.
- No bullet catch.

152
00:13:56,878 --> 00:14:01,216
But the point is that a real magician
tries to invent something new

153
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:04,177
that other magicians
are gonna scratch their heads over.

154
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,513
And then you sell it to him
for a small fortune.

155
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,722
- All right.
- Yeah.

156
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,683
I suppose you have such a trick.

157
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,269
- Actually, I do.
- Would you care to sell it to me?

158
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:13,979
No.
No one else could do my trick.

159
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:16,189
- Any trick can be duplicated, right?
- Wrong.

160
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,234
If Mr. Borden
has invented his masterpiece

161
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:21,570
it might be only he's
prepared to do it.

162
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:24,114
Milton is a great showman,
but Borden is right.

163
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:25,866
He won't get his hands dirty.

164
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:30,412
If you wanna see what it takes
to make real magic, go to the Tenley.

165
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:33,290
There's a Chinaman there,
and he really has what it takes.

166
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:35,709
- Chung Ling Soo.
- Pricey. I can't afford that.

167
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,419
I know the bloke on the door.

168
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,921
You two go and see that show

169
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,965
and whichever one of you
can tell me

170
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:44,009
how he does
the goldfish-bowl trick

171
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:45,469
gets a prize.
- All right.

172
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,304
- Which is?
- Ten minutes on-stage

173
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:49,264
with my old friend Mr. Ackerman.

174
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:50,765
- Really?
- Who's Ackerman?

175
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,059
The top theatrical agent in London.

176
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,146
I saw you drop the knot again.

177
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:59,649
- I think I turned my wrist.
- Some nights you don't get it, do you?

178
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:03,778
I mean, if that knot slips and
Julia's on the hoist, she'll break a leg.

179
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:08,283
It's the wrong knot. Like I said,
the Langford double will hold tighter.

180
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:12,078
The Langford double isn't a wet knot.
It's too dangerous.

181
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,331
If the rope swells up, she won't slip it.

182
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:17,626
- I can slip a Langford underwater.
- She can slip it. We'll practice.

183
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:19,127
Hey, Borden, he said no.

184
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,630
Yeah, well, you know knots
better than me, do you?

185
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:23,715
Listen, no more mistakes.

186
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:26,468
All right. Yeah, do you?
You wanna take over?

187
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:29,471
- Just leave it.
- I didn't think so.

188
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,520
- Hey, Cutter, where's he from?
- Where are you from?

189
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:40,982
- He shifts props for Virgil at the hall.
- Don't you worry he'll steal your tricks?

190
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,443
- He doesn't deal in methods.
- How do you know?

191
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:48,698
Because I hired him to find out
how Virgil does the orange trick.

192
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:51,201
- Well, I don't trust him.
- He's a natural magician.

193
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:52,828
Of course you can't trust him.

194
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:54,704
I think he's all right.

195
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,207
- You think everyone's all right.
- Even you.

196
00:15:57,374 --> 00:16:01,086
Watch your sightlines. If I can see you
kissing your wife's leg every night

197
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:03,797
so can the blokes
at the ends of row three and four.

198
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:38,373
- You're wrong. It can't be.
- No, it is.

199
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,002
- Look at the man.
- This is the trick.

200
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,296
This is a performance right here.

201
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:46,715
This is why no one
can detect his method.

202
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:50,051
Total devotion to his art.

203
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:55,223
Utter self-sacrifice, you know?

204
00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:01,021
It's the only way to escape all this,
you know.

205
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:04,191
All right.

206
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:08,278
I can barely lift this thing
and it's not even filled with water.

207
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,948
Or fish. Look.

208
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:14,242
I don't know. Hang on a second.

209
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:19,372
He must be strong as an ox.

210
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,461
He's been pretending
to be a cripple for years.

211
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:28,089
Any time he's in public. Any time
he goes out. It's unthinkable.

212
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:31,218
Borden saw it at once,
but I couldn't fathom it.

213
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,970
Living my whole life
pretending to be someone else.

214
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:37,808
- You're pretending to be someone else.
- I don't think changing a name compares.

215
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,435
Not just your name.
Who you are and where you're from.

216
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:41,812
I promised my family

217
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,856
I wouldn't embarrass them
with my theatrical endeavors.

218
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:48,276
I thought of a name for you.

219
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,655
The Great Danton.

220
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,282
Do you like it?

221
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,619
- But it's sophisticated.
- It's French.

222
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:07,796
<i>Borden writes as if no one but
he understood the true nature of magic.

223
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,471
<i>But what does he know
of self-sacrifice?

224
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,478
You bloody fool.

225
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:53,425
- He killed it.
- What?

226
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:54,634
What's wrong?

227
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:58,847
- He killed it.
- I'm sure he didn't.

228
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,269
See? Look, now
he'll bring it back.

229
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:09,357
No, he killed it.

230
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,693
No.

231
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:20,702
Look. See?
He's all right. He's fine.

232
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:24,873
- Look at him.
- But where's his brother?

233
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:30,796
He's a sharp lad, your son.

234
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:33,548
Oh, he's my nephew.

235
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:35,091
Oh.

236
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:40,847
You're the lucky one today.

237
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,745
Are you watching closely?

238
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:08,917
Look closer.

239
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:13,755
Never show anyone.

240
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:18,552
They'll beg you and flatter you for the
secret, but as soon as you give it up

241
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,178
you'll be nothing to them.

242
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:22,556
You understand? Nothing.

243
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,600
The secret impresses no one.

244
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:29,271
The trick you use it for is everything.

245
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:38,071
- Well, thank you for lunch, Mr. Borden.
- You're welcome.

246
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:42,784
- Alfred. It's Alfred.
- Alfred.

247
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:45,787
So I could use a cup of tea.

248
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:50,292
I'd scandalize the landlord. I think not.

249
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:53,920
You think that's...?
Is that enough to keep me out?

250
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:57,299
I think so.

251
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:00,093
So I'll see you again?

252
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:10,729
Milk and sugar?

253
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:36,797
- What's in there?
- Angier's machine.

254
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:46,932
You built this, Mr. Cutter?

255
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,893
Oh, no, sir.
This wasn't built by a magician.

256
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,020
This was built by a wizard.

257
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:56,817
A man who can actually do
what magicians pretend to do.

258
00:21:56,983 --> 00:22:01,363
Tell me, Your Honor, what happens
with these things after the trial?

259
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,240
They've been sold to a Lord Caldlow.

260
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:06,201
An avid collector,
apparently very interested in the case.

261
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:08,829
Yeah, well, don't let him take this.

262
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,747
- Why ever not?
- It's too dangerous.

263
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:16,336
I'm sure beneath its bells and whistles
it's got a simple and disappointing trick.

264
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:19,381
Most disappointing of all, sir

265
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:22,926
it has no trick.

266
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,680
It's real.

267
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:32,060
This is the tank Angier drowned in?

268
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:34,229
Yes.

269
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:38,859
This is the place where the
performer's hand reaches through

270
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,735
to the trick padlock.

271
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:43,238
A standard magical apparatus
for escapes.

272
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:45,782
Yeah, with one important difference:

273
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:47,868
This isn't a trick lock.

274
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:49,953
It's been switched for a real one.

275
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,038
What a way to kill someone.

276
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:56,042
They're magicians, Your Honor.
Showmen.

277
00:22:56,209 --> 00:23:00,255
Men who live by dressing up plain
and sometimes brutal truths

278
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:03,300
to amaze, to shock.

279
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:05,844
Even without an audience?

280
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:08,722
There was an audience.

281
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:11,766
You see, this water tank

282
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:16,104
was of particular significance
to these two men.

283
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:20,484
Particularly awful significance.

284
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:26,948
 Which of you brave souls is
willing to bind this lovely young woman?

285
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:30,827
If you would tie her wrists.

286
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:33,163
Bind her feet around the ankle.

287
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:48,428
Are either of you two
gentlemen sailors?

288
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:49,638
No.

289
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,017
I'm sure you can both
tie a strong knot.

290
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:49,531
Robert!

291
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:12,429
No! No! No!

292
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:17,058
Julia. Julia.

293
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:19,686
Julia! Julia!

294
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:07,150
I knew an old sailor once.

295
00:26:07,317 --> 00:26:12,322
He told me he went overboard,
tangled in the sails.

296
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:18,120
They pulled him out,
but it took him five minutes to cough.

297
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:22,249
He said it was like going home.

298
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:29,840
What do you want, Borden?

299
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:38,682
I'm sorry for your loss, Angier.

300
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:44,855
Which knot did you tie?

301
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:49,276
I keep asking myself that.

302
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:53,488
- And?
- And...

303
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:57,325
I'm sorry, I just don't know.

304
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:00,954
You don't know?

305
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:04,458
I'm sorry.

306
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:07,544
You don't know?

307
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:14,009
You don't know?

308
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,641
Alfred?

309
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:24,102
Good news.
We got our first booking today.

310
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:27,230
- I don't think we've had the pleasure.
- Mr. Fallon is my ingénieur.

311
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:30,859
- Where did you get all of...?
- Begged, borrowed, and don't ask.

312
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:35,155
He's a very enterprising soul,
is Mr. Fallon.

313
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:36,782
- So...
- We can't afford to pay him.

314
00:27:36,948 --> 00:27:38,742
Money will come
when we get the audience.

315
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:42,370
But what about until then? I mean,
what I earn, it's barely enough for us.

316
00:27:42,537 --> 00:27:45,707
Don't worry about it. I'll share
half my food with him or something.

317
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:49,503
You're already going to be doing that
with someone else.

318
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:53,757
- No. You're...?
- Having a baby.

319
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:57,719
Oh, my God.
We should have told Fallon.

320
00:27:57,886 --> 00:27:59,679
That is great. We're having a baby.

321
00:27:59,846 --> 00:28:01,890
- We're having a baby.
- Oh, come here.

322
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,853
Alfred, what's this?

323
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:11,066
Oh, this is just the trick to wake
Ackerman up at the end of my act.

324
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:13,860
Is it the masterpiece? The great trick?

325
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:16,571
No, no, no. The world is not ready
for that one yet.

326
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:21,076
This is just your run-of-the-mill,
daring, spectacular bullet catch.

327
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:26,039
- A bullet catch?
- Yeah, but it's safe, I promise. Look.

328
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:30,710
- Shoot me.
- Shoot you?

329
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:31,920
Go on, shoot me.

330
00:28:34,422 --> 00:28:36,550
- Right there.
- No, I can't.

331
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:39,136
No, no, not there.
Shoot me here. Don't...

332
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:47,936
- How's that?
- That's very good.

333
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:50,772
- Go on, tell me how you do it.
- No, I can't do that.

334
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:55,861
- Well, then you can't do it. Alfred...
- I can't do it?

335
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:59,239
I'm sorry, Alfred,
but I can't raise a child on my own.

336
00:28:59,865 --> 00:29:03,118
- You don't tell anybody that I told you.
- Okay.

337
00:29:03,285 --> 00:29:04,995
Gunpowder

338
00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:07,664
wadding

339
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:11,168
and a bullet.

340
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:13,587
A ramrod.

341
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:19,509
Hold out your hand.

342
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:26,475
The bullet is not even in the gun
when the charge is fired.

343
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:30,312
Once you know,
it's actually very obvious.

344
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,356
Well, I mean, you still get...

345
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:36,485
It's dangerous. I mean,
people still get killed doing that.

346
00:29:36,651 --> 00:29:37,861
- Well, how?
- Well, you know.

347
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:40,989
Somebody could get a smart-ass.
He can put a penny or a button

348
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:44,117
or may God forbid, Sarah,
somebody could put a bullet there.

349
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:46,703
Don't worry. Don't worry

350
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:50,165
because I'm not gonna let
anything happen.

351
00:29:50,332 --> 00:29:51,917
Everything's gonna be all right

352
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:58,256
because I love you very much.

353
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:03,678
- Say it again.
- I love you.

354
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:07,182
- Not today.
- What?

355
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:10,477
Well, on some days it's not true,
and today you don't mean it.

356
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:13,730
Maybe today you're more
in love with magic than me.

357
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:16,233
I like being able to tell the difference.

358
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:21,321
It makes the days it is true
mean something.

359
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:25,075
All right.

360
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:47,055
Metal rings, ladies and gentlemen.

361
00:30:47,222 --> 00:30:50,016
If there are any
ladies or gentlemen here.

362
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:53,353
- Solid metal.
- Seen that already.

363
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,064
- Leave it out!
- Come on.

364
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:03,280
Get out your gun, mate.

365
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,032
- Who threw that?
- I did!

366
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,624
Get out your gun.
You're gonna need it.

367
00:31:17,878 --> 00:31:20,088
Get a gun.

368
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:23,967
It's what you came for, is it?

369
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:31,433
So who wants to volunteer?

370
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:34,436
Me! Me!

371
00:31:44,362 --> 00:31:45,781
Me.

372
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:48,325
Watch it, cowboy.

373
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:02,088
Are you man enough, sir?

374
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:08,762
Yes.

375
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:21,775
Which knot did you tie, Borden?

376
00:32:28,031 --> 00:32:30,200
Which knot did you tie, Borden?

377
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:33,120
I don't know.

378
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:52,347
<i>He came in to demand
an answer, and I told him the truth.

379
00:32:52,514 --> 00:32:55,517
<i>That I have fought with myself
over that night.

380
00:32:55,684 --> 00:32:59,146
<i>One half of me swearing blind
that I tied a simple slipknot...

381
00:32:59,312 --> 00:33:02,524
<i>... the other half convinced
that I tied the Langford double.

382
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:04,901
<i>I can never know for sure.

383
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:09,698
How can he not know?

384
00:33:09,865 --> 00:33:12,200
<i>How can he not know?

385
00:33:13,243 --> 00:33:17,164
<i>He must know what he did. He must.

386
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:21,835
Sarah, that bloody hurts.

387
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:25,172
 I don't understand
how it can be bleeding again.

388
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:27,674
It's as bad as the day it happened.

389
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:33,430
- We have to get a doctor back.
- We can't afford the bloody doctor back.

390
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,642
- You've woken her.
- Great.

391
00:33:38,602 --> 00:33:41,229
I'm sorry. I need this to heal
so I can go back to work.

392
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:45,108
Alfred, face things. What tricks
can you perform with this kind of injury?

393
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:48,779
I can do card pulls.
I can do some prop tricks.

394
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:53,241
I can still do that. And I can do the
trick that I've been telling you about.

395
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,410
The one that they're gonna
remember me for.

396
00:33:57,913 --> 00:33:59,664
Come on.

397
00:34:25,524 --> 00:34:28,235
Never thought I'd find an answer
at the bottom of a glass.

398
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:29,945
Hasn't stopped you looking.

399
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:36,409
Heard about a booking.

400
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:40,205
Nice little theater.
Young, up-and-coming magician.

401
00:34:40,372 --> 00:34:41,790
- Who?
- You.

402
00:34:41,957 --> 00:34:43,625
You got me a booking? Why?

403
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:45,710
I wanna keep on working.

404
00:34:45,877 --> 00:34:48,922
And who's gonna hire the ingénieur
that killed Julia McCullough

405
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:51,299
in front of a sellout crowd
at the Orpheum?

406
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:54,302
Someone who knows
it wasn't your fault.

407
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:57,848
Someone who knows Alfred Borden
and his repertoire of exotic knots.

408
00:34:58,014 --> 00:35:01,476
I hear he had a spot of bad luck
catching a bullet south of the river.

409
00:35:01,643 --> 00:35:04,062
That's a dangerous trick, that one.

410
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:11,528
We'll have to whitewash the windows

411
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:15,657
confound the more curious members
of the public, but it will do.

412
00:35:17,742 --> 00:35:20,662
- We should see about an assistant.
- I've made some arrangements.

413
00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:24,249
Have you settled on a name?

414
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:27,836
Yes, I have. The Great Danton.

415
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:30,505
It's a bit old-fashioned, isn't it?

416
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:34,176
No, it's sophisticated.

417
00:35:34,342 --> 00:35:36,761
The birdcage can't be
our climax. Everybody knows it.

418
00:35:36,928 --> 00:35:39,473
- Not like this, they don't.
- I don't wanna kill doves.

419
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:43,185
Then stay off the stage.
You're a magician, not a wizard.

420
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:47,189
You gotta get your hands dirty
if you're gonna achieve the impossible.

421
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:50,984
In here, Miss Wenscombe.

422
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:54,529
No point in you meeting Mr. Angier
if you don't fit.

423
00:35:54,696 --> 00:35:56,656
On the right.

424
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,910
What's so hard about this?

425
00:36:00,076 --> 00:36:03,330
Nothing. But you're going down here.

426
00:36:05,582 --> 00:36:09,044
Hold it. Hold it there.
This has gotta go around there.

427
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:11,296
- And this will conceal it?
- Yeah, oh, sure.

428
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:12,547
- All right?
- Yeah.

429
00:36:12,714 --> 00:36:15,342
- Now, take that one there.
- Yep. Okay.

430
00:36:15,509 --> 00:36:17,969
- Pin this under.
- And this ties up here?

431
00:36:18,136 --> 00:36:19,930
- That ties at the front.
- That's good.

432
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:28,897
Breathe as little as possible.

433
00:36:34,611 --> 00:36:37,405
Now, you see? That'll go.
That'll flatten.

434
00:36:37,572 --> 00:36:38,865
- I see. Yeah.
- Okay.

435
00:36:42,327 --> 00:36:46,248
She's not experienced,
but she knows how to present herself.

436
00:36:46,414 --> 00:36:50,669
A pretty assistant is the most
effective form of misdirection.

437
00:36:51,169 --> 00:36:52,212
Thank you.

438
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:54,381
Ladies and gentlemen,
for my final trick

439
00:36:54,548 --> 00:36:57,217
I will require the assistance
of two volunteers.

440
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:59,719
Mr. Merrit, if you would oblige me?

441
00:37:01,513 --> 00:37:04,683
Yeah. Okay. Bring your hand around.

442
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:06,434
- Under?
- Under, yeah.

443
00:37:07,185 --> 00:37:09,396
There. I put it around its foot.

444
00:37:09,563 --> 00:37:11,398
- Careful.
- He's all right, ain't he?

445
00:37:31,793 --> 00:37:34,629
- You get a volunteer to put a hand there.
- Yeah.

446
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:35,839
And another one there.

447
00:37:36,006 --> 00:37:39,634
Mr. Merrit, if you'll place your hands
on either side of the cage, please.

448
00:37:39,801 --> 00:37:40,844
Thank you, Olivia.

449
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:42,804
You best not be intending

450
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:45,474
to hurt this animal, Mr. Angier.
- Of course not.

451
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,851
You ready? All right.

452
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:49,603
One...

453
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:51,271
Two...

454
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,648
- Three.
- Three. Go.

455
00:37:56,777 --> 00:37:58,487
Well, that's bloody marvelous,
Cutter.

456
00:37:59,654 --> 00:38:00,697
Very nice.

457
00:38:00,864 --> 00:38:02,991
And the best part is...

458
00:38:08,288 --> 00:38:10,415
I thought you said
I had to get my hands dirty.

459
00:38:10,582 --> 00:38:14,002
Someday perhaps you will.
I just had to know that you can.

460
00:38:14,169 --> 00:38:16,880
- Very nice. Very nice, indeed.
- Thank you, Mr. Merrit.

461
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:19,883
I haven't had the chance
to compliment your beautiful theater.

462
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:22,385
Well, it'll be a lot more beautiful
when it's full.

463
00:38:22,552 --> 00:38:24,387
- Don't worry.
- Oh, you all say that.

464
00:38:24,554 --> 00:38:28,350
Why should I worry? If your tricks
don't get them in, somebody else's will.

465
00:38:28,517 --> 00:38:32,687
Maybe somebody willing to do
a bullet catch or a water escape?

466
00:38:32,854 --> 00:38:34,231
Cheap thrills, Mr. Merrit.

467
00:38:34,397 --> 00:38:38,026
People hoping for an accident,
likely to see one too.

468
00:38:38,193 --> 00:38:40,737
What would that do for your business?

469
00:38:41,696 --> 00:38:44,157
- You got a week, John.
- Thank you, Mr. Merrit.

470
00:38:54,543 --> 00:38:56,545
Thank you.

471
00:38:58,672 --> 00:39:01,216
Sir? In the third row there.

472
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:04,219
Please stand up
and show us your handkerchief.

473
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,848
This isn't mine.

474
00:39:08,014 --> 00:39:11,101
Perhaps you'd be so good as to return it
to the lady in the aisle.

475
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:12,561
I believe she has yours.

476
00:39:16,189 --> 00:39:17,774
Thank you.

477
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:22,362
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm making so many mistakes.

478
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:24,364
I'm so nervous.

479
00:39:25,031 --> 00:39:27,075
The audience doesn't seem
to be responding.

480
00:39:27,242 --> 00:39:32,038
They've seen a lot of tricks before,
but not this next one.

481
00:39:40,797 --> 00:39:43,008
Put a cloth over.

482
00:39:43,175 --> 00:39:45,969
- Fingers crossed.
- I'll have the champagne ready.

483
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,279
- You've seen this one before?
- We've seen them all.

484
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:06,865
I'll make it a little harder then, shall I?

485
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:12,454
Two volunteers, please. A lady and
a gentleman to hold this cage with me.

486
00:40:13,121 --> 00:40:16,833
I'll perform this feat in a manner
never before seen by yourselves

487
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,836
or any other audience
anywhere in the world.

488
00:40:22,464 --> 00:40:25,217
Madam, if you'll place one hand
on the back of the cage

489
00:40:25,383 --> 00:40:26,551
one hand on the front.

490
00:40:26,718 --> 00:40:30,597
Sir, one hand on the bottom
of the cage, one hand on the top.

491
00:40:44,152 --> 00:40:46,780
- Should have spotted him.
- You had a lot of plates going.

492
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:49,199
- Don't suppose they'll let us do it again.
- No.

493
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:53,161
- What's the climax of our show?
- Show? You don't have a show.

494
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:54,955
We have a week's engagement.

495
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:58,750
To perform magic, not butcher birds
and break my customers' fingers.

496
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:01,336
Clear out. Anything here
in the morning gets burned.

497
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:03,839
- Mr. Merrit...
- It's done, John.

498
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:07,676
I've hired a comedian.
You know I hate comedians.

499
00:41:09,177 --> 00:41:11,346
Well, there's plenty of good theaters.

500
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:15,517
If we can come up with a new trick,
change the name of the act...

501
00:41:15,684 --> 00:41:17,561
The name stays.

502
00:41:19,521 --> 00:41:24,526
Right. Well, then the new trick's
gonna have to be irresistible, then.

503
00:41:24,693 --> 00:41:26,486
I have a couple of methods to try out.

504
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:29,948
And then we need a new angle
on the presentation.

505
00:41:30,115 --> 00:41:31,908
Oh, and if you need some inspiration

506
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:35,078
there's a technical exposition
at the Albert Hall this week.

507
00:41:35,245 --> 00:41:37,914
Engineers, scientists, you know?

508
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:41,251
That sort of thing
captures a public's imagination.

509
00:41:58,393 --> 00:42:01,730
Mind if I join you? Tesla sends me
down here during the storms.

510
00:42:01,897 --> 00:42:05,025
Perfect excuse to come join
the Great Danton for a drink.

511
00:42:06,234 --> 00:42:08,028
Two of them.

512
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:11,072
Beautiful, isn't it, huh?
God, I miss New York though.

513
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:13,617
- So why are you here?
- The lightning lives here.

514
00:42:13,784 --> 00:42:16,912
And not much else.
Our work is secret.

515
00:42:17,662 --> 00:42:19,414
Is that a cipher?

516
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:24,586
It's a rotating transposition
that shifts every day of the diary.

517
00:42:24,753 --> 00:42:26,505
Simple, but time-consuming
to translate

518
00:42:26,671 --> 00:42:28,632
even when you have
the five-letter keyword.

519
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:30,550
Which is?

520
00:42:30,717 --> 00:42:32,594
We magicians have a circle of trust.

521
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:36,723
You have a circle of trust
with someone whose diary you stole?

522
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:37,933
Maybe I bought it.

523
00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:41,436
And you're hoping to find
a great secret in there.

524
00:42:41,603 --> 00:42:45,273
I've already found it.
That's why I'm here.

525
00:42:51,613 --> 00:42:54,574
Tesla built one for another magician.

526
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:57,994
- Why would you want the same thing?
- Call it a professional rivalry.

527
00:42:58,537 --> 00:43:02,874
Mr. Tesla has built unusual machines
for unusual people.

528
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:04,584
But he would never talk about it.

529
00:43:04,751 --> 00:43:07,671
I understand discretion.
I just want the machine.

530
00:43:10,966 --> 00:43:12,884
Finish your drink.

531
00:43:13,885 --> 00:43:15,220
I wanna show you something.

532
00:43:15,387 --> 00:43:18,640
I think you'll have a special
appreciation for our work.

533
00:43:18,807 --> 00:43:22,185
- I thought it was a secret.
- You're a magician.

534
00:43:22,352 --> 00:43:24,020
Who's gonna believe you?

535
00:43:25,313 --> 00:43:27,357
Not long now.

536
00:43:27,524 --> 00:43:29,943
Our equipment requires
a great deal of current.

537
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,736
Tesla electrified the whole town

538
00:43:31,903 --> 00:43:34,531
in exchange for using
the generators when we need to.

539
00:43:36,158 --> 00:43:39,202
We do our tests
when the townspeople are asleep.

540
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:41,997
Mr. Tesla doesn't wanna scare anyone.

541
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:01,850
Where are the wires?

542
00:44:03,351 --> 00:44:04,519
Exactly.

543
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:17,908
- Where's the generator?
- You saw it last week.

544
00:44:18,074 --> 00:44:21,036
- That must be 10 miles from here.
- Fifteen.

545
00:44:21,203 --> 00:44:24,498
And I have to ride all of them
before I get to bed.

546
00:44:25,373 --> 00:44:28,001
I'll send word for you
in a few days, Mr. Angier.

547
00:44:28,418 --> 00:44:32,214
<i>Magic. Real magic.

548
00:44:32,631 --> 00:44:36,343
Now appearing only here
at London's Royal Albert Hall.

549
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:38,720
One of the miracles of our age.

550
00:44:38,887 --> 00:44:41,014
A technological marvel.

551
00:44:41,181 --> 00:44:43,391
You've never seen anything like it
in your lives.

552
00:44:43,558 --> 00:44:45,936
Your eyes will not believe
what they're witnessing.

553
00:44:46,102 --> 00:44:49,189
The miracle of Nikola Tesla,
ladies and gentlemen.

554
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:51,733
Free, clean power.
Would you like to know the future?

555
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,236
The man speaking now
is going to change the world.

556
00:44:54,402 --> 00:44:59,241
Ladies and gentlemen, come one,
come all. Immediate seating, no waiting.

557
00:45:14,548 --> 00:45:17,676
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry

558
00:45:17,843 --> 00:45:19,594
but objections have been raised

559
00:45:19,761 --> 00:45:23,140
concerning the safety...
- Does that look safe to you?

560
00:45:23,306 --> 00:45:25,725
Part of Thomas Edison's
smear campaign

561
00:45:25,892 --> 00:45:29,771
against Mr. Tesla's
superior alternating current.

562
00:45:29,938 --> 00:45:31,481
Mr. Alley, please.

563
00:45:31,648 --> 00:45:34,151
We have asked Mr. Tesla
to reconsider...

564
00:45:34,317 --> 00:45:36,945
- Which he will not.
- ...his presentation.

565
00:45:37,112 --> 00:45:41,324
But I've been told he refuses
to appear under any such restrictions.

566
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:44,786
Clear the hall!
This thing is gonna blow!

567
00:45:44,953 --> 00:45:47,581
- Clear the hall!
- Ladies and gentlemen, please!

568
00:45:48,248 --> 00:45:50,292
Where's the switch?

569
00:45:54,004 --> 00:45:56,465
This is all perfectly safe.

570
00:46:27,412 --> 00:46:28,455
Hey.

571
00:46:28,622 --> 00:46:30,165
Hello, you.

572
00:46:30,332 --> 00:46:33,126
Hello, Jess.

573
00:46:35,504 --> 00:46:38,298
Have you had a nice day with Mummy?

574
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:43,512
Sarah, I love you.

575
00:46:43,678 --> 00:46:47,057
- See? Today it's true.
- Yeah.

576
00:46:47,224 --> 00:46:48,892
Hello.

577
00:46:49,935 --> 00:46:52,229
<i>I saw happiness.

578
00:46:52,562 --> 00:46:55,524
<i>Happiness that should have been mine.

579
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:57,025
<i>But I was wrong.

580
00:46:57,192 --> 00:47:01,780
<i>His notebook reveals
that he never had the life that I envied.

581
00:47:01,947 --> 00:47:04,282
<i>The family life
that he craves one minute...

582
00:47:04,449 --> 00:47:08,745
<i>... he rails against the next,
demanding freedom.

583
00:47:08,912 --> 00:47:11,790
<i>His mind...
His mind is a divided one.

584
00:47:11,957 --> 00:47:13,792
<i>His soul is restless.

585
00:47:13,959 --> 00:47:20,173
<i>His wife and child tormented
by his fickle and contradictory nature.

586
00:47:23,927 --> 00:47:26,346
What do you think?
What do you think you'll call her?

587
00:47:26,513 --> 00:47:27,764
I don't know.

588
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:30,183
Everybody needs a name.
So, what's hers?

589
00:47:31,101 --> 00:47:32,853
Maybe Sarah.

590
00:47:35,147 --> 00:47:37,607
That's a lovely name.
That's a lovely name.

591
00:47:37,774 --> 00:47:40,902
You talk about what you wanna do
for the rest of the day.

592
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:42,863
All right? Go on. You talk with her.

593
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:47,409
They're taking her away?

594
00:47:49,536 --> 00:47:50,579
To the workhouse?

595
00:47:53,832 --> 00:47:55,876
Now, you keep talking.

596
00:47:58,587 --> 00:48:01,756
Tell Owens I've reconsidered.
Take it. Go on, take it.

597
00:48:06,553 --> 00:48:08,597
It's for the best.

598
00:48:13,768 --> 00:48:15,604
Let me see.

599
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:18,690
I'm gonna learn
all the Professor's secrets.

600
00:48:18,857 --> 00:48:20,942
Only if I teach you how to read.

601
00:48:22,277 --> 00:48:24,488
They're just stupid tricks, right?

602
00:48:24,654 --> 00:48:27,449
Haven't helped you
get out of here, have they?

603
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,453
Or can't you undo real locks,
Professor?

604
00:48:32,662 --> 00:48:35,332
Well, maybe I'm just biding my time.

605
00:48:35,499 --> 00:48:41,338
Maybe one day I'll open my hand,
get your attention, ask:

606
00:48:41,505 --> 00:48:43,590
"Are you watching closely?"

607
00:48:43,757 --> 00:48:46,510
Maybe a magic word or two.

608
00:48:48,428 --> 00:48:50,889
And then I'll be gone.

609
00:48:54,142 --> 00:48:57,395
How'd you get so famous, then, eh?

610
00:48:57,896 --> 00:48:59,523
Magic.

611
00:49:03,401 --> 00:49:04,820
Borden, get back here!

612
00:49:04,986 --> 00:49:06,488
Thank you.

613
00:49:07,114 --> 00:49:09,366
Shut up! Get him down!

614
00:49:09,866 --> 00:49:11,785
Thank you.

615
00:49:12,077 --> 00:49:13,954
Who's got a bloody key?

616
00:49:20,544 --> 00:49:23,046
<i>February 8th, 1899.

617
00:49:23,213 --> 00:49:25,173
<i>Today, finally a breakthrough.

618
00:49:25,841 --> 00:49:27,968
<i>Tesla's agreed to see me.

619
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:36,852
It's perfectly safe.

620
00:49:58,957 --> 00:50:02,043
So this is the Great Danton.

621
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:06,882
Mr. Alley has effused about your act
to me on any number of occasions.

622
00:50:08,758 --> 00:50:10,218
Hold out other hand.

623
00:50:18,935 --> 00:50:20,771
What's conducting the electricity?

624
00:50:20,937 --> 00:50:24,232
Our bodies, Mr. Angier,
are quite capable of conducting

625
00:50:24,399 --> 00:50:26,902
and, indeed, producing energy.

626
00:50:28,487 --> 00:50:30,530
Have you eaten, Mr. Angier?

627
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:35,577
I need something impossible.

628
00:50:37,412 --> 00:50:42,125
You are familiar with the phrase,
"Man's reach exceeds his grasp"?

629
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:43,919
It's a lie.

630
00:50:44,085 --> 00:50:46,046
Man's grasp exceeds his nerve.

631
00:50:47,172 --> 00:50:50,091
Society only tolerates
one change at a time.

632
00:50:51,593 --> 00:50:54,805
The first time
I tried to change the world

633
00:50:54,971 --> 00:50:56,598
I was hailed as a visionary.

634
00:50:57,224 --> 00:51:02,729
Second time,
I was asked politely to retire.

635
00:51:03,605 --> 00:51:06,691
So here I am, enjoying my retirement.

636
00:51:07,234 --> 00:51:09,111
Nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier.

637
00:51:09,277 --> 00:51:10,987
What you want is simply expensive.

638
00:51:11,613 --> 00:51:13,615
If I were to build for you this machine

639
00:51:13,782 --> 00:51:16,451
you would be presenting it
merely as illusion?

640
00:51:16,618 --> 00:51:19,955
Well, if people actually believed
the things I did on-stage

641
00:51:20,122 --> 00:51:23,750
they wouldn't clap, they'd scream.
I mean, think of sawing a woman in half.

642
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:26,795
Mr. Angier, have you considered
the cost of such a machine?

643
00:51:26,962 --> 00:51:28,797
Price is not an object.

644
00:51:29,464 --> 00:51:32,801
Perhaps not,
but have you considered the cost?

645
00:51:33,844 --> 00:51:35,137
I'm not sure I follow.

646
00:51:36,221 --> 00:51:38,014
Go home. Forget this thing.

647
00:51:38,473 --> 00:51:40,308
I can recognize an obsession.

648
00:51:40,934 --> 00:51:42,477
No good will come of it.

649
00:51:42,644 --> 00:51:44,438
Hasn't good come of your obsessions?

650
00:51:45,105 --> 00:51:47,691
At first.
But I have followed them too long.

651
00:51:47,858 --> 00:51:53,321
I am their slave, and one day,
they will choose to destroy me.

652
00:51:54,865 --> 00:51:58,660
If you understand an obsession, then
you know you won't change my mind.

653
00:51:59,953 --> 00:52:00,996
So be it.

654
00:52:02,622 --> 00:52:03,832
Will you build it?

655
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:08,378
I have already begun to build it,
Mr. Angier.

656
00:52:08,545 --> 00:52:10,922
I hope you enjoy the mountain air.

657
00:52:11,089 --> 00:52:13,425
This will take some time.

658
00:52:37,449 --> 00:52:39,326
I thought you'd gone.

659
00:52:40,285 --> 00:52:42,454
I don't really have anywhere to go.

660
00:52:45,332 --> 00:52:46,583
You've been sleeping here?

661
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:51,171
Cutter said it'd be all right till we get
another booking. What are you doing?

662
00:52:52,214 --> 00:52:53,548
Research.

663
00:52:53,715 --> 00:52:58,178
Part of a magician's job is to watch
his competition, to see what illusions...

664
00:52:58,345 --> 00:53:01,097
You're going to do something
to that man, aren't you?

665
00:53:01,264 --> 00:53:03,058
Cutter's hoping you'll let things lie.

666
00:53:03,225 --> 00:53:05,894
He says if Borden thinks things
are even between you two...

667
00:53:06,061 --> 00:53:07,437
Even?

668
00:53:08,021 --> 00:53:10,565
My wife for a couple of his fingers?

669
00:53:10,732 --> 00:53:13,610
He has a family now, right?
And he's performing again.

670
00:53:13,777 --> 00:53:17,531
Borden is living his life just as he always
intended, as if nothing had happened.

671
00:53:17,697 --> 00:53:19,741
And look at... Look at me, all right?

672
00:53:19,908 --> 00:53:22,786
- I'm alone and no theater will touch me.
- Us.

673
00:53:23,745 --> 00:53:26,414
You're going to need a better disguise.

674
00:53:43,557 --> 00:53:44,599
Need a volunteer.

675
00:53:46,017 --> 00:53:47,310
<i>What happened?

676
00:53:48,437 --> 00:53:50,480
Did you hurt him?

677
00:53:52,149 --> 00:53:53,400
What happened, Robert?

678
00:53:55,819 --> 00:53:57,237
You, sir.

679
00:53:57,946 --> 00:54:00,782
Just a rubber ball, yes? Thank you.

680
00:54:00,949 --> 00:54:03,452
Just a rubber ball, no.

681
00:54:03,618 --> 00:54:06,788
Not normal. Not a normal rubber ball.

682
00:54:06,955 --> 00:54:07,998
It's magic.

683
00:54:08,832 --> 00:54:10,792
He had a new trick.

684
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:25,682
<i>Was it good?

685
00:54:30,812 --> 00:54:33,231
It was the greatest magic trick
I've ever seen.

686
00:54:39,321 --> 00:54:40,822
<i>Did they applaud when you saw it?

687
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:43,033
The trick was too good,
it was too simple.

688
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,286
- The audience hardly had time to see it.
- He's a dreadful magician.

689
00:54:46,453 --> 00:54:48,997
No, he's a wonderful magician.
He's a dreadful showman.

690
00:54:49,164 --> 00:54:51,374
He doesn't know how to dress it up,
how to sell...

691
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:53,168
- How does he do it?
- Uses a double.

692
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:55,962
No, no, no, it's too simple.
This is a complex illusion.

693
00:54:56,129 --> 00:54:58,507
You only say that because
you don't know the method.

694
00:54:58,673 --> 00:55:00,842
It's a double at the end.
It's the only way.

695
00:55:01,009 --> 00:55:03,178
I've seen him perform the trick
three times now.

696
00:55:03,345 --> 00:55:05,847
- The Prestige is the same man.
- No, it's not.

697
00:55:06,014 --> 00:55:08,475
The same man comes out
of that second cabinet.

698
00:55:08,642 --> 00:55:09,726
It's the same man.

699
00:55:10,977 --> 00:55:13,355
He wears padded gloves
to hide his damaged fingers

700
00:55:13,522 --> 00:55:15,398
but if you look closely you can tell.

701
00:55:18,193 --> 00:55:20,821
He doesn't know how to sell it
to an audience, but I do.

702
00:55:20,987 --> 00:55:23,323
Yeah, well, we can use it
as a climax to the show.

703
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:25,617
Yes.

704
00:55:25,784 --> 00:55:29,037
The man stole my life,
I'm gonna steal his trick.

705
00:55:29,204 --> 00:55:32,374
- Find someone who looks like you.
- He doesn't use a double.

706
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:35,877
Robert, I don't know
how Borden does the trick, so either...

707
00:55:36,044 --> 00:55:39,422
You either wait for him to retire
and buy the secret

708
00:55:39,589 --> 00:55:41,383
or you listen to how I would do it.

709
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:46,429
The only way that I know how to do it
is to find you a bloody good double.

710
00:55:47,389 --> 00:55:49,015
All right.

711
00:55:50,267 --> 00:55:52,769
Take a good look.
Let's get out there and find me.

712
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,898
Look. Look.

713
00:56:01,027 --> 00:56:02,612
What's that?

714
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:06,908
That is for you.

715
00:56:07,075 --> 00:56:08,827
What's this for?

716
00:56:08,994 --> 00:56:10,620
Come here.

717
00:56:15,792 --> 00:56:19,546
- I asked you last week. You said you...
- You caught me in a wrong mood.

718
00:56:19,754 --> 00:56:21,089
But you went over all the...

719
00:56:21,256 --> 00:56:24,801
Sarah, I'm allowed
to change my mind, aren't I?

720
00:56:25,302 --> 00:56:28,722
The act is taking off,
soon we'll be in a bigger theater.

721
00:56:28,889 --> 00:56:30,098
Things will work out.

722
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,269
I can't believe it. Thank you.

723
00:56:34,436 --> 00:56:36,313
Thank you. It's beautiful.

724
00:56:43,028 --> 00:56:44,780
Gerry?

725
00:56:45,155 --> 00:56:46,198
Darling, look at you.

726
00:56:46,364 --> 00:56:49,117
Mr. Cutter, Mr. Angier,
I'd like you to meet Gerald Root.

727
00:56:54,289 --> 00:56:57,667
A pleasure.
Pleasure to meet you fine gentlemen.

728
00:56:58,251 --> 00:57:02,130
Would you like for me
to tell you a little joke? Come here.

729
00:57:03,965 --> 00:57:05,967
There we are. Yes?

730
00:57:06,134 --> 00:57:08,136
Are you laughing now?

731
00:57:10,347 --> 00:57:13,141
Oh, dear, I have to take a piss.

732
00:57:14,851 --> 00:57:17,646
- He's out of his mind.
- Of course. He's an out-of-work actor.

733
00:57:17,813 --> 00:57:19,648
He's perfect. He needs a little help

734
00:57:19,815 --> 00:57:22,651
but when I get done with him,
he could be your brother.

735
00:57:22,818 --> 00:57:25,320
I don't need him to be my brother,
I need him to be me.

736
00:57:25,487 --> 00:57:27,114
Give me a month.

737
00:57:30,992 --> 00:57:32,828
Come around.

738
00:57:33,995 --> 00:57:38,333
So you open the door and...

739
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:47,175
Come on.

740
00:57:51,054 --> 00:57:54,808
- Couldn't you have found a softer one?
- Well, it's not for sleeping on.

741
00:57:55,392 --> 00:57:59,020
So if you come down through there

742
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:03,066
does Root go up through there?
- Yep.

743
00:58:03,483 --> 00:58:05,193
It's going to be amazing, Robert.

744
00:58:05,735 --> 00:58:09,531
Well, it has to be.
Borden's trick is getting noticed.

745
00:58:11,575 --> 00:58:13,952
The place was packed today.

746
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:17,372
You went and saw his show again.

747
00:58:17,539 --> 00:58:19,875
Ready to meet yourself, Mr. Angier?

748
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:30,552
All I have to do is keep myself drunk

749
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:33,013
and no one will be able
to tell the difference.

750
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,056
Have a little faith, sir.

751
00:58:35,223 --> 00:58:38,935
Now, would you favor us
with a performance, Mr. Root?

752
00:58:44,024 --> 00:58:45,442
Jesus.

753
00:59:00,832 --> 00:59:04,044
Yes, you would drink too if you knew
the world half as well as I do.

754
00:59:07,881 --> 00:59:09,424
Did you think you were unique?

755
00:59:09,591 --> 00:59:12,093
I have been Caesar. I played Faust.

756
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:15,263
How difficult could it possibly be
to play the Great Danton?

757
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:18,600
You can go back to being yourself now,
Root, for nothing.

758
00:59:18,767 --> 00:59:20,936
I'd rather be him for now.

759
00:59:21,103 --> 00:59:23,897
I find it amusing.

760
00:59:27,275 --> 00:59:31,363
My liege, I did deny no prisoners.

761
00:59:32,489 --> 00:59:34,407
- You look wonderful.
- Oh, thank you.

762
00:59:34,574 --> 00:59:37,661
Root has to keep a low profile.
Anyone sees him, the game's up.

763
00:59:37,828 --> 00:59:40,789
I don't know how you do these things.
I'm not sure I wanna know.

764
00:59:41,164 --> 00:59:42,916
Have you thought
what we should call the trick?

765
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:44,543
There's no point in being coy.

766
00:59:45,001 --> 00:59:47,087
Borden calls his trick
"The Transported Man."

767
00:59:51,383 --> 00:59:53,969
Ladies and gentlemen,
much of what you've seen tonight

768
00:59:54,136 --> 00:59:58,807
may be termed as illusions
or entertaining trifles.

769
01:00:02,978 --> 01:00:04,146
Alas

770
01:00:06,314 --> 01:00:08,775
I cannot claim
this next feat as illusion.

771
01:00:09,651 --> 01:00:10,819
Watch carefully.

772
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,781
You'll see no trickery

773
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,825
for no trickery is employed.

774
01:00:17,993 --> 01:00:21,329
Merely a technique familiar
to certain citizens of the Orient

775
01:00:21,496 --> 01:00:23,665
and various holy men
of the Himalayas.

776
01:00:27,127 --> 01:00:29,838
Indeed, many of you
may be familiar with this technique

777
01:00:30,005 --> 01:00:33,049
but for those of you who aren't,
do not be alarmed

778
01:00:33,216 --> 01:00:36,303
what you're about to see
is considered safe.

779
01:01:08,293 --> 01:01:10,378
To our achievement.

780
01:01:11,046 --> 01:01:13,715
The manager says
he's never seen a reaction like it.

781
01:01:13,882 --> 01:01:17,093
At least he got to see it. I spent
the ovation hiding under the stage.

782
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:19,721
No one cares about the man
who disappears into the box.

783
01:01:19,888 --> 01:01:21,556
They care about the one
who comes out.

784
01:01:21,723 --> 01:01:24,559
- I care about the man in the box.
- Thank you.

785
01:01:24,726 --> 01:01:28,063
I don't know. Maybe...
Maybe we could switch before the trick.

786
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:30,398
I could be the Prestige
and Root ends up below.

787
01:01:30,565 --> 01:01:33,235
No, the anticipation of the trick
is everything.

788
01:01:33,401 --> 01:01:36,446
We need your showmanship
to build up the suspense.

789
01:01:36,613 --> 01:01:39,908
Once Root opens his mouth, it's over.
He can't introduce this trick.

790
01:01:40,075 --> 01:01:42,911
Of course I can. I'm the Great Danton.

791
01:01:43,078 --> 01:01:46,581
Root, you bloody fool.
Get out of that wardrobe and makeup.

792
01:01:46,748 --> 01:01:49,251
Anyone could walk in here
at any minute.

793
01:01:49,417 --> 01:01:51,419
Congratulations, all.

794
01:01:51,753 --> 01:01:55,173
Life is not full of these moments,
Robbie. We worked hard.

795
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:56,925
We need to celebrate properly.

796
01:02:00,595 --> 01:02:03,140
What's wrong? Is it your wife?

797
01:02:03,306 --> 01:02:05,559
No. No, it's the trick.
It isn't good enough.

798
01:02:05,725 --> 01:02:08,937
Borden's trick is nothing
compared to ours. He has no style.

799
01:02:09,104 --> 01:02:12,941
Well, he doesn't spend the finale
hiding under the stage.

800
01:02:13,108 --> 01:02:14,776
I need to know how he does it.

801
01:02:14,943 --> 01:02:18,321
- Why?
- So I can do it better.

802
01:02:20,532 --> 01:02:22,451
I need you to go and work for him.

803
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:27,747
Work for him? Are you joking?

804
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,167
You'll be my spy.

805
01:02:30,333 --> 01:02:32,419
We just got our start.
You want me to leave?

806
01:02:32,586 --> 01:02:34,629
That's how we advance.
Think of it, Olivia.

807
01:02:34,796 --> 01:02:38,425
We got people excited, but imagine
what we could do with the real illusion.

808
01:02:38,592 --> 01:02:42,429
We'd have the greatest magic act
anyone's ever seen.

809
01:02:42,596 --> 01:02:43,972
He knows I work for you.

810
01:02:44,139 --> 01:02:47,434
Exactly why he'll wanna hire you.
He'll want my secret.

811
01:02:47,601 --> 01:02:51,646
- Why would he trust me?
- Because you're gonna tell him the truth.

812
01:03:03,992 --> 01:03:05,035
Good girl.

813
01:03:08,288 --> 01:03:11,792
You must be curious to see what so
much money has bought you, Mr. Angier.

814
01:03:12,417 --> 01:03:15,295
It's fitting you should be here
for maiden voyage.

815
01:03:15,462 --> 01:03:17,172
Your hat.

816
01:03:25,305 --> 01:03:27,516
You might wanna stand back.

817
01:03:48,328 --> 01:03:49,371
I don't understand.

818
01:03:49,538 --> 01:03:51,832
Perhaps it would be best
if you left us to it.

819
01:03:51,998 --> 01:03:54,126
- Is there a problem, Mr. Tesla?
- No, no, no.

820
01:03:54,292 --> 01:03:55,836
- Come back next week.
- Next week?

821
01:03:56,002 --> 01:03:58,088
- Come back... Next week, it'll be fine.
- Tesla.

822
01:03:58,255 --> 01:04:01,007
She's just a little temperamental
sometimes.

823
01:04:05,929 --> 01:04:08,723
- Interesting workshop.
- Yeah, we make do.

824
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:11,226
- My name is Olivia Wenscombe...
- I know who you are.

825
01:04:11,393 --> 01:04:12,727
You here to steal my show?

826
01:04:12,894 --> 01:04:14,688
I'm here to give it what it's missing.

827
01:04:14,855 --> 01:04:18,024
- Yeah? What might that be?
- Me.

828
01:04:19,568 --> 01:04:23,530
I was just saying that, wasn't I,
Bernard? Woman's touch.

829
01:04:23,697 --> 01:04:25,532
- I've left Angier.
- All right.

830
01:04:25,699 --> 01:04:28,410
- I want a job.
- Yeah?

831
01:04:28,577 --> 01:04:31,580
- I know you've no reason to trust me...
- Why wouldn't I trust you?

832
01:04:31,746 --> 01:04:35,584
I mean, you're only the mistress of
my enemy. Why wouldn't I trust you?

833
01:04:37,169 --> 01:04:39,087
- Mr. Borden...
- Alfred.

834
01:04:41,506 --> 01:04:43,091
I'm going to tell you the truth.

835
01:04:43,258 --> 01:04:46,428
Now that is a slippery notion
in our line of work

836
01:04:46,595 --> 01:04:47,888
isn't it, Miss Wenscombe?

837
01:04:50,015 --> 01:04:52,601
I am here because he sent me here.

838
01:04:52,768 --> 01:04:55,228
He wants me to work for you
and steal your secret.

839
01:04:55,395 --> 01:04:57,063
What does he need my secret for?

840
01:04:57,230 --> 01:04:58,607
His trick is top-notch.

841
01:04:59,232 --> 01:05:02,444
He vanishes and then he reappears
on the other side of the stage

842
01:05:02,611 --> 01:05:06,448
mute, overweight and,
unless I'm mistaken, very drunk.

843
01:05:06,615 --> 01:05:08,283
It's astonishing. How does he do it?

844
01:05:08,742 --> 01:05:13,580
And tell me, Olivia, does he enjoy
taking his bows under the stage?

845
01:05:13,747 --> 01:05:14,790
No, it's killing him.

846
01:05:14,956 --> 01:05:16,958
He's obsessed
with discovering your methods.

847
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:18,335
He thinks of nothing else.

848
01:05:18,502 --> 01:05:21,588
He takes no pleasure in our success,
and I've had enough.

849
01:05:21,755 --> 01:05:23,173
There is no future with him.

850
01:05:25,383 --> 01:05:29,012
He sent me here to steal your secrets,
but I've actually come to offer you his.

851
01:05:29,513 --> 01:05:33,100
This is the truth, is it?

852
01:05:37,604 --> 01:05:39,314
Think you'd better get dressed, sir.

853
01:05:39,481 --> 01:05:41,691
Root, you're late
and more drunk than usual.

854
01:05:41,858 --> 01:05:44,486
- Now, get down below stairs right away.
- No.

855
01:05:46,071 --> 01:05:49,157
No, we need to have
a little chat, Mr. Cutter.

856
01:05:49,324 --> 01:05:50,367
We have a problem.

857
01:05:50,534 --> 01:05:53,120
Cutter, Borden is performing
right across the street.

858
01:05:53,286 --> 01:05:55,914
Yeah? We have a bigger problem.

859
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:00,001
Root. He's realized
he can make demands.

860
01:06:00,836 --> 01:06:02,170
Wha...? He's blackmailing us?

861
01:06:02,337 --> 01:06:04,172
I was surprised, to tell the truth.

862
01:06:04,339 --> 01:06:06,508
It usually takes them longer
to figure it out.

863
01:06:06,675 --> 01:06:09,469
- Well, how much does he want?
- Well, it makes no difference.

864
01:06:09,636 --> 01:06:13,014
- We gotta stop doing the trick.
- Stop the trick? Cutter, look at this.

865
01:06:13,181 --> 01:06:15,350
Well, look at yesterday's,
look at last week

866
01:06:15,517 --> 01:06:18,854
where they said you were
the premier stage performer in London.

867
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:20,605
Not magician, mind you.

868
01:06:20,772 --> 01:06:23,358
- Performer of any kind.
- Well, what's your point?

869
01:06:23,525 --> 01:06:25,819
My point is, Robert,
is you've climbed too high

870
01:06:25,986 --> 01:06:28,196
to get away
with professional embarrassment.

871
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:31,575
We don't do any tricks
we can't control.

872
01:06:33,785 --> 01:06:35,579
Just pay him
whatever he wants for now.

873
01:06:35,745 --> 01:06:39,166
We keep doing the trick until Borden
opens and then we'll phase it out.

874
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:41,710
All right.

875
01:06:44,379 --> 01:06:48,383
<i>Cutter was always surprised
how fast Root turned bad.

876
01:06:48,967 --> 01:06:52,971
To what do I owe the pleasure
of this rather welcome pint of ale?

877
01:06:53,138 --> 01:06:56,516
- You're the Great Danton, aren't you?
- Shh, shh, shh.

878
01:06:56,683 --> 01:07:00,020
Of course I am, but don't advertise it
because I'll be mobbed with fans.

879
01:07:00,187 --> 01:07:02,063
<i>We paid him enough
to keep him in beers...

880
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:04,399
<i>... so you wouldn't expect him
to rock the boat.

881
01:07:04,566 --> 01:07:07,110
Indeed, many of you
may be familiar with this technique.

882
01:07:07,277 --> 01:07:10,906
But for those of you who aren't,
do not be alarmed

883
01:07:11,072 --> 01:07:14,117
what you're about to see
is considered safe.

884
01:07:14,284 --> 01:07:15,577
And who are you?

885
01:07:15,744 --> 01:07:20,665
I am a humble admirer
and a fellow practitioner.

886
01:07:20,832 --> 01:07:22,918
Very good.

887
01:07:32,427 --> 01:07:35,097
- Another?
- Oh, if you insist.

888
01:07:35,263 --> 01:07:37,182
- Another.
- I'm not performing tonight.

889
01:07:37,349 --> 01:07:39,101
Well, I'm only doing one show

890
01:07:39,267 --> 01:07:42,437
but to be frank, my people
pretty much run things these days.

891
01:07:42,604 --> 01:07:43,730
Get up there!

892
01:07:45,148 --> 01:07:46,191
Get up!

893
01:07:46,358 --> 01:07:48,527
Your illusion, The Transported Man

894
01:07:48,693 --> 01:07:51,655
I'm not claiming
to know your methods or anything

895
01:07:52,364 --> 01:07:58,829
but I had a similar trick in my act,
and I used a double.

896
01:07:59,246 --> 01:08:01,331
Oh. I see. Very good.

897
01:08:01,498 --> 01:08:04,084
Well, it was, and then it went bad.

898
01:08:04,251 --> 01:08:09,631
What I didn't count on, was that when
I incorporated this bloke into my act

899
01:08:09,798 --> 01:08:11,800
he had complete power over me.

900
01:08:13,135 --> 01:08:14,594
Complete power, you say.

901
01:08:32,154 --> 01:08:37,325
Be very careful giving someone
that power over you.

902
01:08:39,703 --> 01:08:41,663
Well, thank you.

903
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:44,124
Yes, thank you for the warning.

904
01:08:46,293 --> 01:08:48,253
Cheers.

905
01:08:49,004 --> 01:08:51,006
I cannot claim this next feat
as illusion.

906
01:08:51,173 --> 01:08:55,385
What you're about to see
is considered safe.

907
01:09:35,383 --> 01:09:37,594
The Great Danton.

908
01:09:43,975 --> 01:09:45,644
I apologize.

909
01:09:45,811 --> 01:09:49,564
There simply is too much magic

910
01:09:49,731 --> 01:09:54,736
for my stage at the Pantages
across the street.

911
01:09:56,071 --> 01:09:58,615
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

912
01:09:58,782 --> 01:10:02,202
Pardon my intrusion.

913
01:10:02,869 --> 01:10:05,705
- Bravo!
- And go easy on the poor chap.

914
01:10:05,872 --> 01:10:08,458
He does try so very hard.

915
01:10:11,586 --> 01:10:13,421
I don't know how Borden found him.

916
01:10:13,588 --> 01:10:15,257
Kept him under wraps, I was careful.

917
01:10:15,423 --> 01:10:17,467
Yeah, well, he did.

918
01:10:18,301 --> 01:10:19,428
Do you think it was her?

919
01:10:26,852 --> 01:10:29,479
You weren't expecting me?

920
01:10:29,646 --> 01:10:32,315
I was expecting you sooner.
Your message said afternoon.

921
01:10:32,482 --> 01:10:34,609
It takes a bit
for me to get around these days.

922
01:10:34,943 --> 01:10:36,611
He's taken everything from me.

923
01:10:36,778 --> 01:10:39,448
My wife, my career, now you.

924
01:10:39,614 --> 01:10:40,991
What do you mean?
You sent me...

925
01:10:41,158 --> 01:10:43,827
I sent you to steal his secret,
not to improve his act.

926
01:10:43,994 --> 01:10:45,454
- That's my job.
- Or fall in love.

927
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:48,206
- I did everything you asked!
- Yes? Yes?

928
01:10:48,373 --> 01:10:50,917
- Then how does he do it?
- Cutter was right, a double.

929
01:10:51,084 --> 01:10:54,337
- Of course Borden said that.
- He didn't say anything. I've seen things.

930
01:10:54,504 --> 01:10:58,300
Makeup, glasses, wigs. We don't use it
for the show, but I've seen it backstage.

931
01:10:58,467 --> 01:11:02,179
Misdirection. He leaves things around
to make you think he's using a double.

932
01:11:02,345 --> 01:11:04,222
All the time?
He doesn't know when I look.

933
01:11:04,389 --> 01:11:06,308
All the time, Olivia!

934
01:11:06,475 --> 01:11:08,810
That's who he is! That's what it takes!

935
01:11:08,977 --> 01:11:11,313
He lives his act! Don't you see?

936
01:11:13,482 --> 01:11:16,651
Just because you're sleeping with him
doesn't mean he trusts you.

937
01:11:16,818 --> 01:11:19,154
You think you can see everything,
don't you?

938
01:11:19,321 --> 01:11:22,991
But the Great Danton is a blind fool.
His notebook.

939
01:11:25,035 --> 01:11:27,162
You stole it?

940
01:11:27,329 --> 01:11:29,122
I borrowed it for tonight.

941
01:11:29,289 --> 01:11:31,249
I thought you could translate it,
but now...

942
01:11:31,416 --> 01:11:32,501
- I can't.
- You can't?

943
01:11:32,667 --> 01:11:35,504
Olivia, no one can, it's a cipher.

944
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:38,590
Even with the keyword
it would take months to decode.

945
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:42,010
- And without the keyword?
- Perhaps never.

946
01:11:42,177 --> 01:11:43,595
- We'll see.
- We will not see.

947
01:11:43,762 --> 01:11:46,681
If I don't get that back to him
tomorrow, he'll know I took it.

948
01:11:46,848 --> 01:11:49,017
- Leave him.
- I can't. He knows where I live.

949
01:11:50,435 --> 01:11:52,354
This is his diary, Olivia.

950
01:11:52,521 --> 01:11:55,190
All of his secrets
are right here in my hands.

951
01:11:56,191 --> 01:11:57,400
Won't bring your wife back.

952
01:11:57,567 --> 01:12:00,737
I don't care about my wife,
I care about his secret.

953
01:12:13,542 --> 01:12:15,377
Look

954
01:12:16,378 --> 01:12:18,547
I'll go to his workshop
and stage a break-in.

955
01:12:18,713 --> 01:12:22,884
- He'll know you took it.
- Yes, me. Not you.

956
01:12:23,051 --> 01:12:24,845
Understand?

957
01:12:33,728 --> 01:12:34,980
Robert.

958
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:39,609
I have fallen in love with him.

959
01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:43,321
Then I know how hard
this has been for you.

960
01:12:51,705 --> 01:12:52,914
Notebook?

961
01:12:55,834 --> 01:12:57,669
Then he's just getting started.

962
01:13:28,492 --> 01:13:30,452
- Good evening.
- Professor.

963
01:13:31,536 --> 01:13:32,662
Professor.

964
01:13:33,121 --> 01:13:34,915
- I...
- Could I get your autograph?

965
01:13:35,081 --> 01:13:38,502
I'm walking tonight.
Let him come. I don't care.

966
01:13:38,668 --> 01:13:41,087
- Professor.
- Professor.

967
01:15:05,839 --> 01:15:08,300
- You all right?
- I'm alive.

968
01:15:08,467 --> 01:15:10,552
Saves me cutting you an air hole.

969
01:15:24,649 --> 01:15:27,110
- I'm impressed.
- Why's that?

970
01:15:27,277 --> 01:15:29,780
You're finally getting your hands dirty.

971
01:15:30,322 --> 01:15:33,116
It's what a good trick costs, Angier.

972
01:15:33,283 --> 01:15:34,618
Risk.

973
01:15:34,785 --> 01:15:36,036
Sacrifice.

974
01:15:36,578 --> 01:15:40,248
The sacrifice, I'm afraid, is gonna be
yours, unless you give me what I want.

975
01:15:41,708 --> 01:15:43,752
- Which is?
- Your secret.

976
01:15:44,294 --> 01:15:46,171
My secret?

977
01:15:46,338 --> 01:15:48,590
Your method for The Transported Man.

978
01:15:48,757 --> 01:15:51,384
Fallon wouldn't tell me.
He doesn't seem to talk at all.

979
01:15:51,551 --> 01:15:52,803
You have my notebook.

980
01:15:52,969 --> 01:15:54,930
Useless without the keyword.

981
01:15:56,431 --> 01:15:58,058
Write down your method, Mr. Borden.

982
01:15:58,225 --> 01:16:00,102
Describe it in full.

983
01:16:13,156 --> 01:16:15,784
I want the whole method,
not the keyword.

984
01:16:15,951 --> 01:16:18,328
I don't even know
if your secret's in your notebook.

985
01:16:18,495 --> 01:16:20,789
The keyword is the method.

986
01:16:24,584 --> 01:16:25,752
<i>Where's my ingénieur?

987
01:16:33,051 --> 01:16:35,470
- Alive?
- How fast can you dig?

988
01:16:38,056 --> 01:16:41,017
Fallon! You hear me? Fallon!

989
01:16:42,436 --> 01:16:44,980
- How's the arm?
- Still attached.

990
01:16:46,523 --> 01:16:48,859
- Did you find your answer?
- Our answer.

991
01:16:49,025 --> 01:16:51,820
Cutter, I haven't looked yet.
I wanted you to share this.

992
01:16:51,987 --> 01:16:54,489
I already know how he does it, Robert.

993
01:16:54,656 --> 01:16:57,492
The same way he always has.
The same way as we do.

994
01:16:57,659 --> 01:17:00,036
It's just that you want
something more.

995
01:17:00,203 --> 01:17:01,788
Well, let's find out then,
shall we?

996
01:17:07,335 --> 01:17:08,628
What does it mean?

997
01:17:16,678 --> 01:17:18,972
It means, Cutter,
we have a journey ahead of us.

998
01:17:19,139 --> 01:17:21,850
- To America.
- Robert?

999
01:17:22,017 --> 01:17:24,186
Listen to me.

1000
01:17:25,103 --> 01:17:28,482
Obsession is a young man's game.

1001
01:17:28,648 --> 01:17:32,569
- Oh, come on.
- I can't follow you any further in it.

1002
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:35,530
I can't. I'm sorry.

1003
01:17:39,868 --> 01:17:41,369
Then the rest is up to me.

1004
01:17:43,455 --> 01:17:45,081
I'm sorry.

1005
01:17:50,295 --> 01:17:53,715
Good evening. Hello, darling.

1006
01:17:54,132 --> 01:17:55,509
Champagne, your finest.

1007
01:17:56,218 --> 01:17:58,637
I didn't know we were
going to be joined for dinner.

1008
01:17:58,804 --> 01:18:01,723
- Absolutely. We are celebrating.
- Miss Wenscombe.

1009
01:18:01,890 --> 01:18:04,851
Mr. Fallon.
Well, what are we celebrating?

1010
01:18:05,018 --> 01:18:07,437
Well, we've hit upon a new trick,
haven't we, Fallon?

1011
01:18:07,604 --> 01:18:10,524
- What trick, Freddy?
- Yes, Freddy, what trick?

1012
01:18:10,690 --> 01:18:14,945
I am going to bury myself alive
every night

1013
01:18:15,112 --> 01:18:18,907
and then someone will come along
and dig me up. Wonderful.

1014
01:18:19,074 --> 01:18:22,953
- I think my husband's had quite enough.
- Pour the champagne. Come on, pour...

1015
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,872
Right. Sarah, don't talk to me like that.
I'm not a child.

1016
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:27,999
- Perhaps it would...
- Perhaps, Mr. Fallon

1017
01:18:28,166 --> 01:18:31,253
you might escort Miss Wenscombe
home. My husband's being a bore.

1018
01:18:31,419 --> 01:18:34,965
- I see no reason why you have to suffer.
- Oh, please. Don't ruin this evening.

1019
01:18:38,427 --> 01:18:41,972
Good night, Mrs. Borden.
Good night, Freddy.

1020
01:18:45,767 --> 01:18:47,936
- "Freddy"?
- Well, that's my name.

1021
01:18:48,103 --> 01:18:52,357
- Not at home.
- Well, I'm not always at home, am I?

1022
01:18:53,316 --> 01:18:56,361
Well, couldn't you have at least
taken off the beard?

1023
01:18:56,528 --> 01:19:00,073
Sarah, I just came from
the bloody theater just now.

1024
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,950
All right? And I'm out in public.

1025
01:19:02,117 --> 01:19:05,245
- Everybody else loves it.
- Why are you being like this, Alfred?

1026
01:19:05,871 --> 01:19:08,165
I had a terrible ordeal today.

1027
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:12,961
I thought that something
very precious

1028
01:19:13,128 --> 01:19:15,046
had been lost to me.

1029
01:19:15,213 --> 01:19:18,300
So I just wanted to celebrate.
Just a little.

1030
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:20,761
All right, what?

1031
01:19:20,927 --> 01:19:22,637
What did you lose?

1032
01:19:27,225 --> 01:19:28,602
I see, more secrets.

1033
01:19:29,561 --> 01:19:32,647
Sarah, secrets are my life.

1034
01:19:34,691 --> 01:19:36,735
- Our life.
- No, Alfred, stop.

1035
01:19:36,902 --> 01:19:40,447
This isn't you. Stop performing.

1036
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:07,182
I thought I had the place
to myself, Mr. Brent.

1037
01:20:07,349 --> 01:20:12,354
Unexpected guests.
Not very polite. A lot of questions.

1038
01:20:12,521 --> 01:20:15,148
First I thought they might work
for the government.

1039
01:20:15,315 --> 01:20:17,192
- No?
- Worse.

1040
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:19,528
They work for Thomas Edison.

1041
01:20:20,904 --> 01:20:23,323
<i>Today, a most curious development.

1042
01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:27,536
<i>His assistant came to us
with a proposition.

1043
01:20:28,328 --> 01:20:31,581
<i>Obviously, Angier has sent her
and told her to admit as much.

1044
01:20:31,748 --> 01:20:34,501
Does he enjoy taking
his bows under the stage?

1045
01:20:34,668 --> 01:20:38,338
He sent me here to steal your secrets,
but I've actually come to offer you his.

1046
01:20:38,839 --> 01:20:42,384
This is the truth, is it?

1047
01:20:50,559 --> 01:20:53,854
No, that's what he told me
to tell you. The truth

1048
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:57,816
is that I loved him, and I stood by him,
and he sent me to you

1049
01:20:57,983 --> 01:21:01,361
like he would send a stagehand
to pick up his shirts.

1050
01:21:01,528 --> 01:21:04,197
I hate him for that.

1051
01:21:04,531 --> 01:21:08,368
I can spot Angier's methods
from the back of the theater.

1052
01:21:09,536 --> 01:21:11,580
So, what could you possibly
have to offer me?

1053
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,833
You know how he does his tricks,
but you can't understand

1054
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,461
why no one can see yours
are better. You hide this.

1055
01:21:17,627 --> 01:21:21,590
I had to look very closely to spot it when
you perform The Transported Man

1056
01:21:21,757 --> 01:21:24,384
but this makes you unique.

1057
01:21:24,551 --> 01:21:26,720
It shows the audience
you aren't using a double.

1058
01:21:26,887 --> 01:21:28,972
You mustn't hide it,
display it proudly.

1059
01:21:29,139 --> 01:21:33,435
I'm sure it takes great skill to
perform illusions with one good hand.

1060
01:21:33,894 --> 01:21:35,937
Yeah, it does.

1061
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:40,025
So let people know.

1062
01:21:40,692 --> 01:21:44,446
You could be so much more than he is,
and I can show you how.

1063
01:21:45,947 --> 01:21:47,741
<i>I think she's telling the truth.

1064
01:21:48,617 --> 01:21:50,744
<i>I think we cannot trust her.

1065
01:21:54,331 --> 01:21:56,750
<i>But I love her. I need her.

1066
01:21:58,043 --> 01:22:01,129
<i>To open myself
to such a relationship...

1067
01:22:01,296 --> 01:22:05,133
<i>... to the dangers of such an affair...

1068
01:22:05,634 --> 01:22:10,013
<i>... I need assurances of fidelity.
Of love.

1069
01:22:11,139 --> 01:22:12,641
<i>But how to be sure?

1070
01:22:15,018 --> 01:22:19,272
<i>I know a way.
It's the only way to know her mind.

1071
01:22:19,439 --> 01:22:21,108
How could he send you away?

1072
01:22:22,984 --> 01:22:25,987
<i>She must help me rid ourselves of Angier.

1073
01:22:32,786 --> 01:22:35,580
<i>Today, my mistress proves
her truthfulness.

1074
01:22:35,747 --> 01:22:37,999
<i>Not to me, you understand.

1075
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:40,210
<i>I've been convinced
since she led me to Root.

1076
01:22:40,377 --> 01:22:46,174
<i>Today, Olivia proves her love for me
to you, Angier.

1077
01:22:46,341 --> 01:22:48,218
<i>Yes, Angier.

1078
01:22:48,385 --> 01:22:50,679
<i>She gave you this notebook
at my request.

1079
01:22:50,846 --> 01:22:56,017
<i>And, yes, "Tesla" is merely the key
to my diary, not to my trick.

1080
01:22:56,184 --> 01:23:00,730
<i>Did you really think I'd part with
my secret so easily after so much?

1081
01:23:00,897 --> 01:23:02,149
<i>Goodbye, Angier.

1082
01:23:02,315 --> 01:23:06,403
<i>May you find solace for your thwarted
ambition back in your American home.

1083
01:23:16,913 --> 01:23:18,206
Tesla!

1084
01:23:19,499 --> 01:23:24,087
Tesla! Alley! Alley!

1085
01:23:24,254 --> 01:23:26,673
Tesla never made a machine
like the one I asked for.

1086
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:29,551
- We never said he had.
- But you let me believe that he had.

1087
01:23:29,718 --> 01:23:32,387
You stole my money because
your funding had been cut off.

1088
01:23:32,554 --> 01:23:36,308
You've been shooting sparks at my
top hat, laughing at me all along

1089
01:23:36,475 --> 01:23:38,935
while using my money
to stave off ruin.

1090
01:23:39,978 --> 01:23:41,897
- Now, I have seen Edison's men.
- Where?

1091
01:23:42,063 --> 01:23:45,066
In the hotel. And I have every mind
to bring them up here myself.

1092
01:23:45,233 --> 01:23:47,235
That would be unwise, Mr. Angier.

1093
01:23:47,402 --> 01:23:50,447
It is true that you are
our last remaining financier

1094
01:23:50,614 --> 01:23:52,407
but we have not stolen your money.

1095
01:23:52,574 --> 01:23:53,909
Sir, my cat.

1096
01:23:54,075 --> 01:23:57,078
 When I told you I could make
your machine, I spoke a simple truth.

1097
01:23:57,245 --> 01:24:00,665
- Then why isn't the machine working?
- Because exact science, Mr. Angier

1098
01:24:00,832 --> 01:24:02,375
is not an exact science.

1099
01:24:02,542 --> 01:24:05,378
The machine simply does not operate
as expected.

1100
01:24:05,545 --> 01:24:07,798
It requires further examination.

1101
01:24:07,964 --> 01:24:10,592
- So where did my top hat go?
- Nowhere.

1102
01:24:10,759 --> 01:24:13,512
We tried the damn thing
a dozen times.

1103
01:24:13,678 --> 01:24:15,013
The hat went nowhere.

1104
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:17,099
We need to try different material.

1105
01:24:17,265 --> 01:24:20,352
It may provoke a different result.

1106
01:24:22,104 --> 01:24:23,563
Copernicus, come on.

1107
01:24:30,737 --> 01:24:35,242
You are responsible for whatever
happens to this animal, doctor.

1108
01:24:56,304 --> 01:24:59,975
I hope that whatever you were doing
with my money was more worthwhile

1109
01:25:00,142 --> 01:25:02,102
Mr. Tesla.

1110
01:25:57,157 --> 01:25:58,200
Alley!

1111
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:02,871
So the machine was working.

1112
01:26:03,038 --> 01:26:06,541
I never bothered to check the calibration
because the hat never moved.

1113
01:26:06,708 --> 01:26:09,795
These things never quite work
as you expect them to, Mr. Angier.

1114
01:26:09,961 --> 01:26:12,130
That's one of the principal
beauties of science.

1115
01:26:12,297 --> 01:26:15,675
I'll need a couple of weeks to iron out
the problems with the machine.

1116
01:26:15,842 --> 01:26:18,053
We'll send word when it's ready.

1117
01:26:20,222 --> 01:26:22,349
Don't forget your hat.

1118
01:26:23,183 --> 01:26:26,937
- Well, which one is mine?
- They're all your hats, Mr. Angier.

1119
01:26:32,943 --> 01:26:35,862
You look so pretty
in this new dress of yours.

1120
01:26:36,029 --> 01:26:37,906
Are we going to the zoo
this afternoon?

1121
01:26:38,073 --> 01:26:39,908
No, no, no.
Daddy has some errands to run.

1122
01:26:40,075 --> 01:26:42,077
- But you promised.
- I promised, did I?

1123
01:26:42,244 --> 01:26:44,412
Then go to the zoo we shall.

1124
01:26:44,579 --> 01:26:47,874
So Daddy will go run his errands
and I'll be back before you know it

1125
01:26:48,041 --> 01:26:50,836
so you go get ready.
We'll go see those chimpanzees.

1126
01:26:55,006 --> 01:26:56,967
Sarah.

1127
01:26:57,342 --> 01:26:59,136
What are you doing?

1128
01:27:01,930 --> 01:27:05,058
We each of us have our vices.

1129
01:27:08,103 --> 01:27:11,523
Sarah, whatever you may think

1130
01:27:12,023 --> 01:27:15,610
your only competition for
my affections is our little girl.

1131
01:27:15,777 --> 01:27:20,115
I love you. I will always love you
and you alone.

1132
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:25,370
- You mean it today.
- Absolutely.

1133
01:27:26,204 --> 01:27:29,499
Which makes it so much harder
when you don't.

1134
01:27:39,176 --> 01:27:41,928
Is that more shopping?
She does love the smell of money.

1135
01:27:42,095 --> 01:27:45,432
The little lady wants to go to the zoo,
so I thought you could take her.

1136
01:27:45,599 --> 01:27:48,685
Yeah? I mean,
I can do it tomorrow if not.

1137
01:27:48,852 --> 01:27:54,316
And Sarah, she knows.

1138
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:58,361
She... I mean, at least she knows
that something's not right

1139
01:27:58,528 --> 01:28:01,990
so if you can just do whatever
you can to help me with her.

1140
01:28:02,157 --> 01:28:06,119
Talk to her. Just convince her
that I do love her.

1141
01:28:17,089 --> 01:28:21,134
- What is it, Freddy?
- Just don't call me that, please.

1142
01:28:21,301 --> 01:28:23,845
It's nothing. It's just, you know,
there's sometimes...

1143
01:28:24,012 --> 01:28:26,306
- Sometimes it seems wrong.
- I've told you before

1144
01:28:26,473 --> 01:28:28,058
when you're with me,
you're with me.

1145
01:28:28,225 --> 01:28:30,477
Leave your family at home
where they belong.

1146
01:28:30,894 --> 01:28:32,354
I'm trying.

1147
01:28:32,521 --> 01:28:34,022
I'm trying, Olivia.

1148
01:28:34,189 --> 01:28:36,691
- I'll get dressed.
- Yeah.

1149
01:28:38,026 --> 01:28:40,862
I saw Fallon hanging around again.

1150
01:28:41,404 --> 01:28:43,532
There's something
about that man I don't trust.

1151
01:28:43,865 --> 01:28:46,701
You trust me? Then trust Fallon.

1152
01:28:47,202 --> 01:28:49,412
He protects the things
that I care about.

1153
01:29:27,742 --> 01:29:30,078
We're sorry to see you go, Mr. Angier.

1154
01:29:30,245 --> 01:29:32,789
We were sorry to see
Mr. Tesla leave as well.

1155
01:29:32,956 --> 01:29:34,958
He was very good to Colorado Springs.

1156
01:29:35,459 --> 01:29:37,002
Mr. Angier

1157
01:29:37,711 --> 01:29:41,423
I didn't think it was necessary
to tell Edison's men about the box.

1158
01:29:42,048 --> 01:29:43,091
What box?

1159
01:30:08,575 --> 01:30:11,912
<i> I apologize for leaving
without saying goodbye...

1160
01:30:12,370 --> 01:30:16,541
<i>... but I seem to have outstayed
my welcome in Colorado.

1161
01:30:17,292 --> 01:30:21,755
<i>The truly extraordinary is not
permitted in science and industry.

1162
01:30:21,922 --> 01:30:24,633
<i>Perhaps you'll find more luck
in your field...

1163
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,344
<i>... where people are happy
to be mystified.

1164
01:30:27,511 --> 01:30:31,431
<i>You will find what
you are looking for in this box.

1165
01:30:31,848 --> 01:30:35,894
<i>Alley has written you
a thorough set of instructions.

1166
01:30:36,061 --> 01:30:40,690
<i>I add only one suggestion
on using the machine:

1167
01:30:40,857 --> 01:30:42,818
<i>Destroy it.

1168
01:30:42,984 --> 01:30:46,071
<i>Drop it to the bottom
of the deepest ocean.

1169
01:30:46,238 --> 01:30:49,449
<i>Such a thing
will bring you only misery.

1170
01:30:53,495 --> 01:30:57,040
<i>Tesla's warning is as unheeded
as he knew it would be.

1171
01:30:57,207 --> 01:30:59,167
<i>Today, I tested the machine...

1172
01:30:59,334 --> 01:31:03,797
<i>taking precautions in case Tesla hadn't
ironed out the kinks in its operation.

1173
01:31:03,964 --> 01:31:08,802
<i>I mean, if it went wrong,
I would not wanna live like that for long.

1174
01:31:27,446 --> 01:31:31,491
But here at the Turn,
<i>I must leave you, Borden.

1175
01:31:31,658 --> 01:31:33,827
<i>Yes, you, Borden.

1176
01:31:33,994 --> 01:31:36,204
<i>Sitting there in your cell...

1177
01:31:36,371 --> 01:31:40,417
<i>... reading my diary,
awaiting your death...

1178
01:31:40,584 --> 01:31:42,669
<i>... for my murder.

1179
01:31:47,841 --> 01:31:51,052
Angier's journal, that gesture
of good faith, that's a fake.

1180
01:31:51,219 --> 01:31:52,387
I assure you, it's not.

1181
01:31:52,554 --> 01:31:55,223
The provenance of the journal
is clear and under no doubt.

1182
01:31:55,390 --> 01:31:59,936
And it's written in Angier's own hand,
of which we had numerous examples.

1183
01:32:01,897 --> 01:32:03,690
It don't matter.

1184
01:32:05,734 --> 01:32:08,653
So my tricks.

1185
01:32:11,031 --> 01:32:14,701
- All of them.
- Including The Transported Man?

1186
01:32:15,535 --> 01:32:17,829
Well, Lord Caldlow
will be very pleased indeed.

1187
01:32:17,996 --> 01:32:21,500
No, he won't.
Because they're not complete.

1188
01:32:21,666 --> 01:32:24,252
It's just the Pledge
and the Turn for each.

1189
01:32:24,419 --> 01:32:27,047
Without the Prestige for these tricks

1190
01:32:27,631 --> 01:32:29,966
these are worthless.
- Yeah.

1191
01:32:30,634 --> 01:32:34,096
You get the rest of it
when you bring my daughter here.

1192
01:32:36,973 --> 01:32:39,059
I wanna say goodbye.

1193
01:32:40,936 --> 01:32:42,270
We have to go through it now.

1194
01:32:42,437 --> 01:32:44,981
Listen, we have to go through it now.
Now, listen to me.

1195
01:32:45,148 --> 01:32:46,441
Deny it all you want.

1196
01:32:46,608 --> 01:32:48,902
Olivia means nothing.

1197
01:32:49,069 --> 01:32:50,445
- Olivia?
- I need an assistant.

1198
01:32:50,612 --> 01:32:51,780
No, I'll go to her.

1199
01:32:51,947 --> 01:32:53,615
- I'll tell her I know...
- Tell her what?

1200
01:32:53,782 --> 01:32:57,494
I know what you really are, Alfred. I...

1201
01:32:57,953 --> 01:32:59,913
- I know, and I...
- Sarah, Sarah.

1202
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:02,290
- I can't keep it in.
- You can't talk like this.

1203
01:33:02,457 --> 01:33:03,500
Sarah, shut up.

1204
01:33:03,667 --> 01:33:04,960
- No, no.
- Sarah, shut up!

1205
01:33:05,293 --> 01:33:06,962
I don't wanna hear it anymore!

1206
01:33:07,129 --> 01:33:10,132
You can't talk like this!

1207
01:33:11,842 --> 01:33:14,928
 You can't hide it anymore
because I know, Alfred, I know.

1208
01:33:15,095 --> 01:33:16,805
I know what you really are!

1209
01:33:16,972 --> 01:33:18,640
Alfred

1210
01:33:18,807 --> 01:33:21,518
I can't live like this.

1211
01:33:21,685 --> 01:33:23,645
Oh, well, you think I can live like this?

1212
01:33:23,812 --> 01:33:26,982
You think I bloody enjoy
living like this?

1213
01:33:27,149 --> 01:33:29,734
- Stop it and listen! No!
- We have this beautiful house

1214
01:33:29,901 --> 01:33:33,155
lovely little girl, we're married.
What is so wrong with your life?

1215
01:33:33,321 --> 01:33:35,824
Alfred, I can't live like this!

1216
01:33:36,116 --> 01:33:38,869
Well, what do you want from me?

1217
01:33:43,498 --> 01:33:45,167
I want...

1218
01:33:45,333 --> 01:33:48,462
I want you to be honest with me.

1219
01:33:51,339 --> 01:33:53,175
No tricks

1220
01:33:53,842 --> 01:33:57,220
no lies

1221
01:33:57,471 --> 01:34:00,640
and no secrets.

1222
01:34:06,229 --> 01:34:09,566
Do you...? Do you love me?

1223
01:34:12,402 --> 01:34:14,154
Not today.

1224
01:34:16,156 --> 01:34:17,199
No.

1225
01:35:55,130 --> 01:35:57,132
Who's there?

1226
01:35:59,259 --> 01:36:01,052
I'm looking for an old friend.

1227
01:36:01,219 --> 01:36:03,096
I heard about a booking.

1228
01:36:03,263 --> 01:36:05,849
Nice little theater.
Good up-and-coming magician.

1229
01:36:06,016 --> 01:36:08,310
- You're back.
- It's good to see you, John.

1230
01:36:09,269 --> 01:36:11,855
Good rehearsal space.

1231
01:36:12,022 --> 01:36:14,649
Blind stagehands, I like it.

1232
01:36:14,816 --> 01:36:17,277
You always had
a good eye for publicity.

1233
01:36:17,444 --> 01:36:18,820
I need your help, John.

1234
01:36:19,321 --> 01:36:21,656
It's my last show.
A limited engagement.

1235
01:36:22,115 --> 01:36:23,366
Your last show?

1236
01:36:23,909 --> 01:36:27,329
A wise man once told me
obsession was a young man's game.

1237
01:36:27,496 --> 01:36:28,538
I'm almost done.

1238
01:36:29,498 --> 01:36:31,291
There's one thing left.

1239
01:36:32,334 --> 01:36:34,711
The Real Transported Man.

1240
01:36:36,630 --> 01:36:38,548
You wanna design a show around it.

1241
01:36:38,715 --> 01:36:41,510
I don't want you backstage.
I need you front of house, managing.

1242
01:36:41,676 --> 01:36:44,221
I need you to call in favors
or connections you have.

1243
01:36:44,387 --> 01:36:47,974
- Get us the right booking for the run.
- What sort of booking you after?

1244
01:36:48,141 --> 01:36:50,352
The sort that Borden can't ignore.

1245
01:36:58,401 --> 01:37:00,487
What an honor it is
to see you again, sir.

1246
01:37:00,654 --> 01:37:03,990
You said you only wanted to show me
one trick. It piqued my interest.

1247
01:37:04,157 --> 01:37:07,202
- It's a very clever trick, Mr. Ackerman.
- Pleased to meet you.

1248
01:37:07,369 --> 01:37:10,205
Likewise, I'm sure.
Well, let's get on, shall we?

1249
01:37:14,042 --> 01:37:16,044
Turn it on, gentlemen.

1250
01:37:20,924 --> 01:37:22,008
Very pretty.

1251
01:37:33,186 --> 01:37:36,606
That's it, Cutter?
He simply disappears?

1252
01:37:36,773 --> 01:37:39,609
That's not a trick.
Well, he has to come back.

1253
01:37:39,776 --> 01:37:40,861
There has to be a...

1254
01:37:41,027 --> 01:37:42,446
- A Prestige?
- Exactly.

1255
01:37:45,615 --> 01:37:47,409
Pardon me.

1256
01:37:48,201 --> 01:37:50,620
It's very rare to see

1257
01:37:51,580 --> 01:37:53,498
real magic.

1258
01:37:54,291 --> 01:37:57,961
- It's been many years since I've seen...
- Are you interested in helping us?

1259
01:38:00,172 --> 01:38:01,631
Yes.

1260
01:38:02,257 --> 01:38:04,593
But you'll have to dress it up a little.

1261
01:38:06,219 --> 01:38:07,888
Disguise it.

1262
01:38:09,431 --> 01:38:11,933
Give them enough reason to doubt it.

1263
01:38:12,768 --> 01:38:15,979
You haven't spoken about her,
Freddy. Not once.

1264
01:38:16,146 --> 01:38:19,775
Why would I talk about her to you?

1265
01:38:19,941 --> 01:38:22,319
Because she was a part of your life.

1266
01:38:22,486 --> 01:38:23,653
And now she's gone.

1267
01:38:26,573 --> 01:38:30,869
The day before she killed herself,
she said she wanted to meet me.

1268
01:38:31,161 --> 01:38:34,122
That she had something
to tell me about you.

1269
01:38:34,289 --> 01:38:37,626
I was such a coward,
I couldn't bring myself to face her.

1270
01:38:37,793 --> 01:38:39,461
But

1271
01:38:40,670 --> 01:38:42,839
what would she have said?

1272
01:38:43,006 --> 01:38:45,926
You wanna know the truth about me?

1273
01:38:47,052 --> 01:38:50,555
Truth is that

1274
01:38:51,973 --> 01:38:53,975
I never loved Sarah.

1275
01:38:55,602 --> 01:38:56,645
I never loved her.

1276
01:38:56,812 --> 01:39:00,148
- You married her, had a child with her.
- Yes, yes. Part of me.

1277
01:39:00,315 --> 01:39:04,027
Part of me did,
but the other part didn't.

1278
01:39:04,194 --> 01:39:07,531
The part that found you.
The part that's sitting here right now.

1279
01:39:08,615 --> 01:39:09,658
I love you.

1280
01:39:10,158 --> 01:39:13,537
No, Olivia, I love you. That's the truth.

1281
01:39:13,703 --> 01:39:16,123
That is the truth that matters.

1282
01:39:16,289 --> 01:39:20,502
You could be in some other restaurant
with some other woman right now

1283
01:39:20,669 --> 01:39:22,295
talking about me that way.

1284
01:39:22,462 --> 01:39:24,464
- No.
- Yes.

1285
01:39:27,843 --> 01:39:32,597
It's inhuman to be so cold.

1286
01:39:37,769 --> 01:39:41,565
He's back. After two years.

1287
01:39:41,731 --> 01:39:45,402
He's got a new trick. They're saying
it's the best London's ever seen.

1288
01:39:47,737 --> 01:39:51,158
You should see the look
on your face, Professor.

1289
01:39:52,117 --> 01:39:53,994
You should go to him.

1290
01:39:54,161 --> 01:39:56,538
You two deserve each other.

1291
01:40:01,626 --> 01:40:05,422
I'm afraid I'm booked. Moscow Ballet,
they'll be playing through next year.

1292
01:40:05,589 --> 01:40:08,216
Then get rid of them.
There'll be a hundred performances.

1293
01:40:08,383 --> 01:40:10,051
No more, no less.

1294
01:40:10,218 --> 01:40:12,679
Five performances a week.
No matinees.

1295
01:40:14,556 --> 01:40:17,517
And that's what you'll be charging
for each ticket. Good day.

1296
01:40:40,290 --> 01:40:42,793
Ladies and gentlemen,
my first trick of the evening

1297
01:40:42,959 --> 01:40:45,629
is one that involves
considerable risk.

1298
01:40:46,088 --> 01:40:48,840
Anyone in the audience
who would be irrevocably damaged

1299
01:40:49,007 --> 01:40:52,052
by seeing a man drown
should leave now.

1300
01:40:52,219 --> 01:40:55,180
For when I tell you the young lady
who taught me this illusion

1301
01:40:55,347 --> 01:40:56,932
actually died performing it

1302
01:40:57,099 --> 01:41:00,310
you will understand the seriousness
of the dangers involved.

1303
01:41:02,562 --> 01:41:04,272
Let's begin.

1304
01:41:14,658 --> 01:41:18,036
In my travels, I have seen the future

1305
01:41:19,162 --> 01:41:21,998
and it is a strange future indeed.

1306
01:41:22,707 --> 01:41:24,793
The world, ladies and gentlemen

1307
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:29,172
is on the brink of new
and terrifying possibilities.

1308
01:41:49,526 --> 01:41:53,989
What you're about to witness
is not magic.

1309
01:41:54,156 --> 01:41:55,615
It is purely science.

1310
01:41:55,991 --> 01:41:58,410
I would like to invite you
to come up on-stage now

1311
01:41:58,577 --> 01:42:01,496
so that you can examine
the machine for yourselves.

1312
01:42:56,968 --> 01:43:00,138
Man's reach exceeds his imagination.

1313
01:43:00,305 --> 01:43:01,515
Bravo!

1314
01:43:04,476 --> 01:43:07,062
Bravo! Bravo!

1315
01:43:11,525 --> 01:43:14,069
Bravo. Bravo.

1316
01:43:22,327 --> 01:43:26,456
One hundred performances.
Why? Does his method dictate that?

1317
01:43:26,623 --> 01:43:28,542
Is it a publicity move? What is it?

1318
01:43:28,708 --> 01:43:31,086
He's a no-talent magician,
and they're calling him

1319
01:43:31,253 --> 01:43:33,380
the bloody best in England. Why?

1320
01:43:33,588 --> 01:43:36,258
Fifty yards in a second. In a second!

1321
01:43:36,425 --> 01:43:39,386
And all that we know
is he uses a trap door.

1322
01:43:39,553 --> 01:43:43,765
Brilliant. What is going on
under that stage?

1323
01:43:43,932 --> 01:43:46,726
Why can't you outthink him?

1324
01:44:01,450 --> 01:44:06,288
They do this every night?
After each performance, yeah?

1325
01:44:36,693 --> 01:44:38,320
We're done.

1326
01:44:39,488 --> 01:44:40,906
All right?

1327
01:44:42,324 --> 01:44:43,992
Let him have his trick.

1328
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:46,578
I don't need... I don't need his secret.

1329
01:44:46,745 --> 01:44:48,330
So

1330
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:52,542
don't go back there,
you leave him alone.

1331
01:44:52,751 --> 01:44:55,921
Both of us, just leave him alone.

1332
01:44:56,088 --> 01:44:57,547
We're done.

1333
01:45:06,515 --> 01:45:08,475
I told you, John

1334
01:45:08,642 --> 01:45:10,560
I don't want you backstage
on this one.

1335
01:45:12,437 --> 01:45:14,856
I would like to invite you
to come up on-stage now

1336
01:45:15,023 --> 01:45:18,068
so that you can examine
the machine for yourselves.

1337
01:45:46,555 --> 01:45:50,559
- Hey, where do you think you're going?
- I'm part of the bloody act, you fool.

1338
01:45:59,609 --> 01:46:01,403
Who was that?

1339
01:46:57,918 --> 01:46:58,960
Hey!

1340
01:46:59,127 --> 01:47:02,631
Where's the bloody key?
Where's the bloody key?

1341
01:47:05,258 --> 01:47:08,804
Where's the bloody key?
Bloody drowning!

1342
01:47:18,188 --> 01:47:20,148
Hold on!

1343
01:47:24,569 --> 01:47:25,821
What have you done?

1344
01:47:47,759 --> 01:47:50,887
Alfred Borden,
you have been found guilty

1345
01:47:51,054 --> 01:47:53,098
of the murder of Robert Angier.

1346
01:47:53,265 --> 01:47:56,893
You will be hanged by the neck
until dead.

1347
01:47:57,686 --> 01:48:00,689
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.

1348
01:48:02,315 --> 01:48:04,109
Mr. Cutter?

1349
01:48:04,860 --> 01:48:06,153
Owens.

1350
01:48:06,862 --> 01:48:09,030
Oh, thank you for coming, Mr. Owens.

1351
01:48:09,197 --> 01:48:13,493
It has fallen to me to dispose
of Mr. Angier's equipment.

1352
01:48:13,660 --> 01:48:15,412
But I noticed from this manifest

1353
01:48:15,579 --> 01:48:18,874
that Lord Caldlow
has purchased the bulk of the items.

1354
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:23,003
Mr. Cutter, if you need to know where
to deliver these items, surely you...

1355
01:48:23,170 --> 01:48:26,465
No, no. It's just
there is one particular item

1356
01:48:26,631 --> 01:48:30,677
this item, in fact,
that I would like to...

1357
01:48:30,844 --> 01:48:32,846
- You would like to...?
- Buy.

1358
01:48:33,013 --> 01:48:34,931
- Buy yourself?
- Yeah, I suppose so.

1359
01:48:36,183 --> 01:48:38,101
- This is the machine?
- Yes.

1360
01:48:38,268 --> 01:48:42,731
I'm afraid Lord Caldlow was adamant
about purchasing this particular item.

1361
01:48:43,190 --> 01:48:45,901
Do you think I could talk
to Lord Caldlow in person?

1362
01:48:46,318 --> 01:48:48,737
Out of the question, I'm afraid.

1363
01:48:51,239 --> 01:48:53,033
Of course

1364
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:56,077
I suppose if, in the course
of your delivery arrangements

1365
01:48:56,244 --> 01:48:58,705
your paths were to cross

1366
01:48:59,122 --> 01:49:03,001
I can't stop you speaking your mind.
- Thank you.

1367
01:49:04,544 --> 01:49:06,755
- Still here, Borden?
- For now.

1368
01:49:07,464 --> 01:49:08,757
Got a visitor.

1369
01:49:08,924 --> 01:49:10,300
Lord Caldlow.

1370
01:49:10,467 --> 01:49:12,552
With a little girl.

1371
01:49:21,061 --> 01:49:22,646
Jess?

1372
01:49:22,813 --> 01:49:24,314
Hello, my love.

1373
01:49:25,023 --> 01:49:27,901
How are you? I've missed you so much.

1374
01:49:28,068 --> 01:49:30,112
And Fallon's missed you too.
We both have.

1375
01:49:30,278 --> 01:49:32,489
Daddy, can I come in there?

1376
01:49:33,281 --> 01:49:35,617
Not right now. Not right now, darling.

1377
01:49:35,784 --> 01:49:39,329
No, but everything is gonna be all right.

1378
01:49:39,788 --> 01:49:42,457
- You must be Lord Caldlow.
- Caldlow.

1379
01:49:42,791 --> 01:49:43,917
Yes, I am.

1380
01:49:44,084 --> 01:49:45,252
I always have been.

1381
01:49:50,298 --> 01:49:52,467
They flatter you
with all those chains, Alfred.

1382
01:49:52,634 --> 01:49:55,595
Don't they know you can't escape
without your little rubber ball?

1383
01:49:55,762 --> 01:49:56,888
I pulled you out.

1384
01:49:57,055 --> 01:49:58,598
Out of that tank.

1385
01:49:58,765 --> 01:50:02,436
All I wanted to do was prove
that I was a better magician

1386
01:50:02,602 --> 01:50:04,479
but you couldn't leave me alone.

1387
01:50:06,148 --> 01:50:08,316
I don't know what you've done

1388
01:50:10,193 --> 01:50:13,697
but you're not afraid to get
your hands dirty anymore, are you?

1389
01:50:13,864 --> 01:50:15,699
No, not anymore.

1390
01:50:15,866 --> 01:50:17,117
And I win.

1391
01:50:17,284 --> 01:50:20,454
Because no one cares about the man
in the box, the man who disappears.

1392
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:21,663
You win?

1393
01:50:23,165 --> 01:50:27,586
This ain't a bloody competition anymore,
Angier, this is my little girl's life.

1394
01:50:27,753 --> 01:50:30,839
And don't you dare put her
in the middle of this.

1395
01:50:31,006 --> 01:50:33,842
Oh, I know how hard it is
to have someone so special

1396
01:50:34,009 --> 01:50:36,636
taken away from me,
don't I, Borden?

1397
01:50:37,471 --> 01:50:40,098
And you can't take her with you now,
can you?

1398
01:50:40,265 --> 01:50:42,017
Oh, she'll be looked after.

1399
01:50:42,559 --> 01:50:46,688
- Goodbye, Professor. Come on, darling.
- No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop. Look.

1400
01:50:46,855 --> 01:50:48,190
Here.

1401
01:50:49,649 --> 01:50:51,359
That's what you're after.

1402
01:50:51,526 --> 01:50:53,653
That's what this is about.

1403
01:50:53,820 --> 01:50:55,071
Take it.

1404
01:50:55,238 --> 01:50:57,199
- Your secret?
- Yeah.

1405
01:51:00,202 --> 01:51:02,579
You always were the better magician.

1406
01:51:02,746 --> 01:51:04,247
We both know that.

1407
01:51:04,414 --> 01:51:06,917
But whatever your secret was,
I mean, you have to agree

1408
01:51:08,335 --> 01:51:09,377
mine is better.

1409
01:51:11,296 --> 01:51:14,508
Don't do this. Don't do this,
Angier, no. Jess, Jess, Jess.

1410
01:51:14,883 --> 01:51:18,053
Jess, I'm gonna take you home soon.
I promise.

1411
01:51:18,428 --> 01:51:20,722
- For God's sake, Borden.
- I promise. Look.

1412
01:51:24,684 --> 01:51:26,061
I promise.

1413
01:51:26,228 --> 01:51:29,898
- I love you, Jess. I love you.
- Come on.

1414
01:51:30,065 --> 01:51:33,235
- Come on. Come on.
- I love you. I love you, Jess.

1415
01:51:33,401 --> 01:51:35,737
Angier. Angier!

1416
01:51:35,904 --> 01:51:37,906
What, you think this place
can hold me?

1417
01:51:38,073 --> 01:51:40,951
Angier! They're gonna
bloody hang me!

1418
01:51:41,118 --> 01:51:44,246
They're gonna bloody hang me!
You can put a stop to this now!

1419
01:51:44,413 --> 01:51:46,498
- Listen! Listen! That man!
- Just shut up.

1420
01:51:46,665 --> 01:51:49,084
Listen, that man is the one
I'm meant to have killed!

1421
01:51:49,251 --> 01:51:51,211
You blind bastard, listen to me!

1422
01:51:51,378 --> 01:51:53,296
- If he's alive, I'm not guilty!
- Guards!

1423
01:51:53,463 --> 01:51:55,632
- I'm not guilty!
- I don't care! Get hold of him!

1424
01:51:55,799 --> 01:51:57,801
- Goodbye, Professor.
- Angier!

1425
01:52:02,556 --> 01:52:04,266
Run along now.

1426
01:52:05,225 --> 01:52:08,728
Sir. There's a gentleman waiting.

1427
01:52:24,578 --> 01:52:25,620
Dear God.

1428
01:52:26,413 --> 01:52:28,081
Hello, Cutter.

1429
01:52:28,665 --> 01:52:30,584
You're... You're still alive.

1430
01:52:30,751 --> 01:52:32,502
How is it you're still alive, Robert?

1431
01:52:32,753 --> 01:52:35,046
I saw you on a slab, for God's sake.

1432
01:52:38,091 --> 01:52:40,093
- Child.
- Good night, sir.

1433
01:52:40,260 --> 01:52:41,762
Good night, Jess.

1434
01:52:43,555 --> 01:52:45,056
I've seen her before.

1435
01:52:45,223 --> 01:52:50,520
I saw her in court with Fallon.

1436
01:52:52,397 --> 01:52:54,900
- What have you done?
- Well, she needs looking after.

1437
01:52:55,066 --> 01:52:57,319
She needs her father.

1438
01:52:57,736 --> 01:53:00,489
You're letting him hang,
and I helped you.

1439
01:53:00,655 --> 01:53:06,536
I came here to beg Lord Caldlow
to let me destroy that machine.

1440
01:53:07,079 --> 01:53:10,332
I am not gonna beg you for anything.

1441
01:53:10,499 --> 01:53:13,752
You don't have to. I'm gonna make sure
that machine's never used again.

1442
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:19,174
Then, Lord Caldlow

1443
01:53:20,675 --> 01:53:22,594
where do you want me to deliver it?

1444
01:53:22,761 --> 01:53:24,137
My theater.

1445
01:53:24,304 --> 01:53:26,431
It belongs with the Prestige materials.

1446
01:53:27,057 --> 01:53:29,559
John, I tried not to involve you.

1447
01:53:42,531 --> 01:53:44,407
So

1448
01:53:46,743 --> 01:53:48,829
we go alone now.

1449
01:53:49,496 --> 01:53:51,373
Both of us.

1450
01:53:54,793 --> 01:53:58,213
Only I don't have as far to go as you.

1451
01:54:03,468 --> 01:54:05,137
No.

1452
01:54:06,263 --> 01:54:09,641
You were right, I should have left him
to his damn trick.

1453
01:54:11,184 --> 01:54:12,936
I'm sorry.

1454
01:54:14,729 --> 01:54:17,107
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

1455
01:54:18,233 --> 01:54:20,402
I'm sorry about Sarah.

1456
01:54:22,070 --> 01:54:23,780
I didn't mean to hurt her.

1457
01:54:23,947 --> 01:54:25,907
I didn't.

1458
01:54:27,451 --> 01:54:30,162
You go live your life
in full now, all right?

1459
01:54:30,328 --> 01:54:31,872
You live for both of us.

1460
01:54:40,589 --> 01:54:42,132
Goodbye.

1461
01:55:28,428 --> 01:55:30,222
Are you watching closely?

1462
01:56:01,670 --> 01:56:03,672
Put it down the end.

1463
01:56:37,247 --> 01:56:41,418
Take a minute to consider
your achievement.

1464
01:56:41,835 --> 01:56:46,965
I once told you about a sailor
who described drowning to me.

1465
01:56:47,132 --> 01:56:49,217
Yes, he said it was like going home.

1466
01:56:50,260 --> 01:56:55,182
I was lying. He said it was agony.

1467
01:57:33,929 --> 01:57:35,889
Alfred Borden

1468
01:57:36,264 --> 01:57:40,018
this day, in the name of the king
and the High Court of England

1469
01:57:40,185 --> 01:57:42,437
you will meet your end.

1470
01:57:44,106 --> 01:57:47,025
No one cares about
the man in the box.

1471
01:57:51,113 --> 01:57:52,739
Cutter?

1472
01:57:57,452 --> 01:57:59,037
Cutter?

1473
01:58:00,831 --> 01:58:04,251
Do you have anything to say?

1474
01:58:07,796 --> 01:58:09,256
Abracadabra.

1475
01:58:45,876 --> 01:58:47,627
A brother.

1476
01:58:47,794 --> 01:58:49,129
A twin.

1477
01:58:50,297 --> 01:58:55,594
You were Fallon the whole time.

1478
01:58:55,761 --> 01:58:56,887
No.

1479
01:58:57,888 --> 01:59:01,516
We were both Fallon.
And we were both Borden.

1480
01:59:07,689 --> 01:59:10,609
Were you...? Were you the one
who went into the box

1481
01:59:10,776 --> 01:59:12,569
or the one who came back out?

1482
01:59:13,862 --> 01:59:15,947
We took turns.

1483
01:59:20,827 --> 01:59:22,829
The trick is where we would swap.

1484
01:59:29,127 --> 01:59:30,670
Cutter knew. Cutter knew.

1485
01:59:30,837 --> 01:59:33,590
But I told him
it was too simple, too easy.

1486
01:59:34,758 --> 01:59:36,384
No.

1487
01:59:37,135 --> 01:59:39,012
Simple maybe, but not easy.

1488
01:59:39,387 --> 01:59:42,933
<i>There's nothing easy
about two men sharing one life.

1489
01:59:48,688 --> 01:59:50,774
I don't understand
how it can be bleeding again.

1490
01:59:55,779 --> 01:59:57,948
What about Olivia? And your wife?

1491
01:59:58,907 --> 02:00:00,867
We each loved one of them.

1492
02:00:04,579 --> 02:00:06,581
<i>I loved Sarah.

1493
02:00:07,624 --> 02:00:09,876
<i>He loved Olivia.

1494
02:00:10,335 --> 02:00:15,465
We each had half of a full life, really,
which was enough for us.

1495
02:00:15,632 --> 02:00:17,426
Just.

1496
02:00:19,177 --> 02:00:21,012
But not for them.

1497
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:28,353
See, sacrifice, Robert,
that's the price of a good trick.

1498
02:00:30,856 --> 02:00:33,608
But you wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

1499
02:00:37,112 --> 02:00:38,405
I've made sacrifices.

1500
02:00:38,572 --> 02:00:40,323
- No.
- Yes.

1501
02:00:40,949 --> 02:00:43,910
It takes nothing
to steal another man's work.

1502
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:46,705
It takes everything.

1503
02:01:06,808 --> 02:01:08,935
No. No.
No, wait! I'm the...!

1504
02:01:15,984 --> 02:01:18,111
It took courage.

1505
02:01:20,322 --> 02:01:23,450
It took courage to climb
into that machine every night

1506
02:01:24,284 --> 02:01:29,247
not knowing
if I'd be the man in the box

1507
02:01:32,125 --> 02:01:33,168
or in the Prestige.

1508
02:01:35,003 --> 02:01:39,633
Do you wanna...?
Do you wanna see what it cost me?

1509
02:01:40,092 --> 02:01:43,220
You didn't see where you are, did you?

1510
02:01:43,845 --> 02:01:46,014
Look. Look.

1511
02:01:47,057 --> 02:01:49,142
I don't care.

1512
02:01:53,438 --> 02:01:56,066
You went halfway around the world.

1513
02:01:57,067 --> 02:02:00,028
You spent a fortune.

1514
02:02:01,863 --> 02:02:04,199
You did terrible things.

1515
02:02:05,367 --> 02:02:08,203
Really terrible things, Robert.

1516
02:02:09,955 --> 02:02:11,373
And all for nothing.

1517
02:02:12,624 --> 02:02:15,335
- For nothing?
- Yeah.

1518
02:02:18,713 --> 02:02:23,468
You never understood why we did this.

1519
02:02:26,388 --> 02:02:29,641
The audience knows the truth.

1520
02:02:30,225 --> 02:02:34,229
The world is simple. It's miserable.

1521
02:02:36,022 --> 02:02:38,525
Solid all the way through.

1522
02:02:40,444 --> 02:02:45,031
But if you could fool them,
even for a second

1523
02:02:46,575 --> 02:02:49,286
then you could make them wonder.

1524
02:02:50,120 --> 02:02:51,955
And then you...

1525
02:02:52,414 --> 02:02:56,877
Then you got to see something
very special.

1526
02:03:00,756 --> 02:03:03,008
You really don't know?

1527
02:03:06,678 --> 02:03:11,975
It was the look on their faces.

1528
02:03:27,157 --> 02:03:32,162
<i>Every magic trick consists
of three parts or acts.

1529
02:03:35,457 --> 02:03:38,668
<i>The first part is called the Pledge.

1530
02:03:39,086 --> 02:03:41,755
<i>The magician shows you
something ordinary.

1531
02:03:42,923 --> 02:03:46,635
<i>The second act is called the Turn.

1532
02:03:46,885 --> 02:03:49,971
<i>The magician takes
the ordinary something...

1533
02:03:50,138 --> 02:03:53,100
<i>... and makes it into
something extraordinary.

1534
02:03:54,392 --> 02:03:56,144
<i>But you wouldn't clap yet...

1535
02:03:56,311 --> 02:03:59,397
<i>... because making something
disappear isn't enough.

1536
02:04:00,023 --> 02:04:03,527
<i>You have to bring it back.

1537
02:04:36,935 --> 02:04:40,021
<i>Now you're looking for the secret.

1538
02:04:42,274 --> 02:04:47,195
<i>But you won't find it because,
of course, you're not really looking.

1539
02:04:49,197 --> 02:04:52,284
<i>You don't really want to work it out.

1540
02:04:55,370 --> 02:04:57,664
<i>You want to be fooled.

1541
