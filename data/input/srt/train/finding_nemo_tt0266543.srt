1
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:36,763
<i>- Wow.</i>
<i>- Mmm.</i>

2
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:39,897
<i>- Wow.</i>
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

3
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:42,066
<i>- Wow.</i>
<i>- Yes, Marlin.</i>

4
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:44,201
No, I see it.
It's beautiful.

5
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:46,769
So, Coral, when you said
you wanted an ocean view...

6
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:50,977
you didn't think you'd get
the whole ocean, did you?

7
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:55,818
Oh, yeah.
A fish can breathe out here.

8
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:57,789
Did your man deliver,
or did he deliver?

9
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:00,122
- My man delivered.
- And it wasn't so easy.

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,459
Because a lot of other clownfish
had their eyes on this place.

11
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:05,930
You better believe they did...
every single one of them.

12
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:07,990
Mm-hmm. You did good.

13
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:10,662
And the neighborhood
is awesome.

14
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,341
So, you do like it, don't you?

15
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:25,840
No, no. I do, I do.
I really do like it.

16
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:28,820
But, Marlin, I know that
the drop off is desirable...

17
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:31,119
with the great schools
and the amazing view...

18
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:32,926
but do we really need
so much space?

19
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:33,221
But do we really need
so much space?

20
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,057
Coral, honey, these are our kids
we're talking about.

21
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,257
They deserve the best.
Look, look, look.

22
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,528
They'll wake up,
poke their little heads out...

23
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:41,434
and they see a whale!
Right by their bedroom window.

24
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,629
And they see a whale!
Right by their bedroom window.

25
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,968
Shh. You'll wake the kids.

26
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:47,802
Oh, right, right.

27
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:56,311
Aw, look. They're dreaming.

28
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,510
We still have to name them.

29
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:00,314
You want to name
all of them right now?

30
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:03,618
All right, we'll name
this half Marlin Junior...

31
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:05,783
and this half Coral Junior.

32
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:08,385
- OK, we're done.
- I like Nemo.

33
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:11,192
Nemo. We'll name one Nemo...

34
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,791
but I'd like most of them
to be Marlin Junior.

35
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,198
Just think,
in a couple of days...

36
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:18,727
- we're going to be parents.
- Yeah.

37
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,398
What if they don't like me?

38
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,964
- Marlin.
- No, really.

39
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:26,968
There's over 400 eggs.
Odds are, one will like you.

40
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,310
What?

41
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,980
- You remember how we met?
- I try not to.

42
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,488
Well, I remember.
"Excuse me, miss...

43
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,991
"can you check and see
if I have a hook in my lip?"

44
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,391
You got a little closer
because it was wiggling.

45
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:44,555
- Get away, get away!
- Here he is. Cutie's here.

46
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,525
Where did everybody go?

47
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,401
Coral, get inside the house.

48
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,345
No, Coral, don't.
They'll be fine.

49
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,975
Just get inside...
You, right now.

50
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,618
No! Ow!

51
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,555
Oh!

52
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,251
Ooh! Ooh!

53
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,402
Coral!

54
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:35,881
Coral?

55
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,382
Coral?

56
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,521
Coral?

57
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,294
Coral?

58
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:58,998
Coral?

59
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:13,746
Oh!

60
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,692
Ohh.

61
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,559
There, there, there.

62
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,087
It's OK. Daddy's here.

63
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,994
Daddy's got you.

64
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:36,366
I promise, I will never
let anything happen to you...

65
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,172
Nemo.

66
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,083
First day of school!

67
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,881
Wake up, wake up!
First day of school.

68
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,410
I don't want to go to school...
five more minutes.

69
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:23,717
Not you, Dad, me.

70
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,155
- OK. Huh?
- Get up, get up.

71
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,887
It's time for school,
time for school.

72
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,485
All right, I'm up.

73
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,190
Whoa!

74
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,959
- Nemo!
- First day of school!

75
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,160
- Nemo, don't move.
- Unh! Unh!

76
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,600
You'll never get out
of there yourself.

77
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,797
I'll do it. Unh!

78
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,806
- You feel a break?
- No.

79
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,569
Sometimes you can't tell
'cause fluid rushes to the area.

80
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,803
- Are you woozy?
- No.

81
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,108
- How many stripes do I have?
- I'm fine.

82
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,943
- Answer the stripe question.
- Three.

83
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,448
No! See?
Something's wrong with you.

84
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:53,281
I have one, two, three...
That's all I have?

85
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,220
You're OK.
How's the lucky fin?

86
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:59,053
- Lucky.
- Let's see.

87
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,016
Are you sure you want to go
to school this year?

88
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,962
There's no problem if you don't.
You can wait 5 or 6 years.

89
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,862
Come on, Dad,
it's time for school.

90
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,561
- Forgot to brush.
- Ohh.

91
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,593
Do you want this anemone
to sting you?

92
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:14,037
- Yes.
- Brush.

93
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,734
- OK, I'm done.
- You missed a spot.

94
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:16,075
- Where?
- There.

95
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:17,736
- Where?
- There.

96
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,746
Ha ha! Right there.
And here and here.

97
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:29,722
All right, we're excited.

98
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,882
All right, we're excited.

99
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,686
The first day of school.
Here we go.

100
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,693
We're ready to learn
to get some knowledge.

101
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,127
What's the one thing we have
to remember about the ocean?

102
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,597
- It's not safe.
- That's my boy.

103
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,896
First, we check to see
that the coast is clear.

104
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,334
We go out... and back in.

105
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,668
And then we go out...
and back in.

106
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,732
And then one more time...
out and back in.

107
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,607
And sometimes, if you want
to do it four times...

108
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:54,010
- Dad...
- All right, come on, boy.

109
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,810
Maybe while I'm at school,
I'll see a shark.

110
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:02,514
- I highly doubt that.
- Have you ever met a shark?

111
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,216
No, and I don't plan to.

112
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,454
- How old are sea turtles?
- I don't know.

113
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,188
Sandy Plankton
from next door...

114
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:12,131
he says that sea turtles live
to be about 100 years old.

115
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:14,565
He says that sea turtles live
to be about 100 years old.

116
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,864
If I ever meet a sea turtle,
I'll ask him.

117
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,837
After I'm done
talking to the shark, OK?

118
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,440
Whoa! Hold on.
Wait to cross.

119
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,465
Whoa! Hold on.
Wait to cross.

120
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,703
Hold my fin.

121
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,075
Dad, you're not
going to freak out...

122
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,103
like you did at
the petting zoo, are you?

123
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,911
That snail was about to charge.

124
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,384
Hmm. I wonder where
we're supposed to go.

125
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,909
Bye, Mom!

126
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,047
I'll pick you up after school.

127
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,784
Ha ha!

128
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,885
Come on, you guys, stop it!
Give it back!

129
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,920
Come on,
we'll try over there.

130
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:48,324
Excuse me, is this where
we meet his teacher?

131
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,892
Well, look who's out
of the anemone.

132
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:51,637
Yes. Shocking, I know.

133
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,126
Yes. Shocking, I know.

134
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,934
- Marty, right?
- Marlin.

135
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,133
- Bob.
- Ted.

136
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,165
Bill.
Hey, you're a clownfish.

137
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,770
You're funny, right?
Tell us a joke.

138
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,109
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

139
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,048
Well, actually,
that's a common misconception.

140
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,608
Clownfish are no funnier
than any other fish.

141
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,643
- Come on, clownie.
- Do something funny.

142
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,156
All right, I know one joke.

143
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:15,251
There's a mollusk, see?
And he walks up to a sea...

144
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,353
He doesn't walk up,
he swims up.

145
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,261
Actually,
the mollusk isn't moving.

146
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:22,859
He's in one place,
and then the sea cucumber...

147
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,369
Well, they... I'm mixed up.

148
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:27,133
There was a mollusk
and a sea cucumber.

149
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,174
None of them were walking,
so forget that l...

150
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:28,731
None of them were walking,
so forget that l...

151
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:32,005
Sheldon! Get out of
Mr. Johannsen's yard now!

152
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,410
- Whoa!
- All right, you kids!

153
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,507
Ooh, where'd you go?

154
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,711
Dad, can I go play, too?
Can I?

155
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,744
I would feel better if
you'd play on the sponge beds.

156
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:49,294
That's where I would play.

157
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,364
- What's wrong with his fin?
- He looks funny.

158
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,765
Ow! Hey, what'd I do?

159
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,769
Be nice.
It's his first time at school.

160
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:00,499
He was born with it.
We call it his lucky fin.

161
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,801
- Dad...
- See this tentacle?

162
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,969
It's actually shorter
than all my other tentacles...

163
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,138
but you can't really tell.

164
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,613
Especially when
I twirl them like this.

165
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,708
I'm H-2-O intolerant.

166
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,719
- Ah-choo!
- I'm obnoxious.

167
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,311
<i>Oh</i>

168
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:18,187
<i>Let's name the zones,</i>
<i>the zones, the zones</i>

169
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,387
<i>Let's name</i>
<i>the zones of the open sea</i>

170
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:22,621
Mr. Ray!

171
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,563
- Come on, Nemo.
- You better stay with me.

172
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,463
<i>Mesopelagic, bathyal,</i>
<i>abyssalpelagic</i>

173
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,936
<i>All the rest are too deep</i>
<i>for you and me to see</i>

174
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,303
Huh. I wonder where
my class has gone?

175
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,069
We're under here!

176
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,973
Oh, there you are.

177
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,568
Climb aboard, explorers.

178
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:40,909
<i>Oh, knowledge</i>
<i>exploring</i>

179
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,437
<i>Is, oh, so lyrical</i>

180
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,915
<i>When you think thoughts</i>
<i>that are empirical</i>

181
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,111
Dad, you can go now.

182
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:49,246
- Hello. Who is this?
- I'm Nemo.

183
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:52,951
Nemo, all new explorers
must answer a science question.

184
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,790
- OK.
- You live in what kind of home?

185
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,523
An anemon-none.

186
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,554
A nemenem-menome.

187
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,625
OK, don't hurt yourself.
Welcome aboard, explorers.

188
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,602
Just so you know,
he's got a little fin.

189
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,298
I find if he's having
trouble swimming...

190
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,307
I let him take a break,
10, 15 minutes.

191
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,775
Dad, it's time
for you to go now.

192
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,869
Don't worry. We're gonna
stay together as a group.

193
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,312
OK, class,
optical orbits up front.

194
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:18,340
And remember, we keep
our supraesophogeal ganglion...

195
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,818
to ourselves.
That means you, Jimmy.

196
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:20,953
Aw, man!

197
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,818
Aw, man!

198
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,880
Bye, Nemo!

199
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,323
Bye, Dad!

200
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,020
Bye, son!

201
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,026
Be safe.

202
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,624
You're doing pretty well
for a first-timer.

203
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,999
You can't hold on to them
forever, can you?

204
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,266
I had a tough time with
my oldest out at the drop off.

205
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,569
They got to grow up...
The drop off?

206
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:44,474
They're going to the drop off?
What are you, insane?

207
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,809
Why don't we fry them up now
and serve them with chips?

208
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,109
Hey, Marty, calm down.

209
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,412
Don't tell me
to be calm, pony boy.

210
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,748
Pony boy?

211
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:56,653
For a clownfish,
he really isn't that funny.

212
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,088
Pity.

213
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,988
<i>Oh</i>

214
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,586
<i>Let's name the species,</i>
<i>the species, the species</i>

215
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:03,925
<i>Let's name the species</i>
<i>that live in the sea</i>

216
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,123
Whoa.

217
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,961
<i>There's</i>

218
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,058
<i>Porifera, coelenterata,</i>
<i>hydrozoa, scyphozoa</i>

219
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:11,160
<i>Anthozoa, ctenophora,</i>
<i>bryozoas, three</i>

220
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,865
<i>Gastropoda, arthropoda,</i>
<i>echinoderma</i>

221
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,203
<i>And some fish</i>
<i>like you and me</i>

222
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,572
Come on, sing with me.

223
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,941
<i>Oh</i>

224
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,681
<i>Just the girls this time.</i>

225
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,686
<i>Oh, seaweed is cool</i>

226
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,982
<i>Seaweed is fun</i>

227
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,488
<i>It makes its food</i>

228
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,818
OK, the drop off.

229
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,125
All right, kids,
feel free to explore...

230
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,324
but stay close.

231
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,560
Stromalitic
cyanobacteria! Gather.

232
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,632
An entire ecosystem contained
in one infinitesimal speck.

233
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,332
<i>There are as many protein pairs</i>
<i>contained in this...</i>

234
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,807
Come on, let's go.

235
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,207
<i>Come on, sing with me!</i>

236
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,507
<i>There's porifera,</i>
<i>coelenterata</i>

237
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,013
<i>Hydrozoa, scyphozoa</i>

238
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,615
<i>Anthozoa, ctenophora,</i>
<i>bryozoas, three</i>

239
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,675
Hey, guys, wait up!

240
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,983
Whoa.

241
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,716
Cool.

242
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,021
Saved your life!

243
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,394
Aw, you guys made me ink.

244
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,266
What's that?

245
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:19,728
<i>I know what that is.</i>
<i>Sandy Plankton saw one.</i>

246
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,866
He said it was called a butt.

247
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,341
- Whoa.
- Wow.

248
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,674
<i>That's a pretty big butt.</i>

249
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:31,344
Oh, look at me.
I'm going to touch the butt.

250
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,851
- Ah-choo! Whoa!
- Ha ha ha!

251
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,684
Oh, yeah?
Let's see you get closer.

252
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:38,349
OK.

253
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,881
Beat that.

254
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,451
Come on, Nemo.
How far can you go?

255
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,964
My dad says it's not safe.

256
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,933
- Nemo! No!
- Dad?

257
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,401
You were about
to swim into open water.

258
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,664
No, I wasn't...

259
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,535
Good thing I was here.
If I hadn't shown up...

260
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,836
- He wasn't going to go.
- He was too afraid.

261
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,172
No, I wasn't.

262
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,642
This does not
concern you, kids...

263
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,043
and you're lucky
I don't tell your parents.

264
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,377
You know you can't swim well.

265
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,348
I can swim fine, Dad, OK?

266
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,284
No, it's not OK.
You shouldn't be near here.

267
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,719
OK, I was right. You'll start
school in a year or two.

268
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,485
No, Dad! Just because
you're scared of the ocean...

269
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:12,992
Clearly, you're not ready...

270
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:13,686
Clearly, you're not ready...

271
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:14,886
and you're not coming back
until you are.

272
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,189
You think
you can do these things...

273
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,128
but you just can't, Nemo!

274
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,057
I hate you.

275
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,896
<i>There's</i>

276
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,768
Nothing to see.
Gather. Over there.

277
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,068
Excuse me.
Is there anything I can do?

278
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:30,166
I am a scientist, sir.
Is there any problem?

279
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,302
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to interrupt things.

280
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:35,177
He isn't a good swimmer,
and it's a little too soon...

281
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,943
<i>for him to be out here</i>
<i>unsupervised.</i>

282
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,745
<i>I can assure you,</i>
<i>he's quite safe with me.</i>

283
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:41,753
I'm sure he is,
but you have a large class...

284
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:44,620
and he can get lost from sight
if you're not looking.

285
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:44,857
<i>I'm not saying</i>
<i>you're not looking.</i>

286
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:45,846
<i>I'm not saying</i>
<i>you're not looking.</i>

287
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:48,826
Oh, my gosh!
Nemo's swimming out to sea!

288
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:51,891
Nemo!

289
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,994
<i>What do you think you're doing?</i>

290
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,832
You'll get stuck out there...

291
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,362
and I'll have to get you
before another fish does.

292
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,304
Get back here!

293
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,334
I said get back here now!

294
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:11,213
Stop! You take
one more move, mister...

295
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,115
<i>Don't you dare!</i>

296
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,211
If you put one fin
on that boat...

297
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:16,744
Are you listening to me?

298
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:20,418
Don't touch the bo... Nemo!

299
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,086
He touched the butt.

300
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,857
You paddle your little tail
right back here, Nemo.

301
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,057
That's right.

302
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,793
You are in big trouble,
young man.

303
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,630
<i>Do you hear me? Big...</i>

304
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,405
- Big...
- Aah!

305
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,604
Aah!

306
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,701
Daddy! Help me!

307
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:41,713
I'm coming, Nemo!

308
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,949
- Aah!
- Get under me, kids!

309
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,383
Aah! Oh! No!

310
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,113
Dad!

311
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,553
Daddy!

312
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:56,659
Oh! Nemo!

313
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,089
Unh. Nemo!

314
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:04,762
Nemo, no! Nemo!

315
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:07,772
Nemo! Nemo! No!

316
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,166
No!

317
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:15,112
Aah!

318
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:19,474
Uhh.

319
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,610
Nemo! Nemo!

320
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,127
Whoa! Hold on.

321
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:48,140
Oh, no.

322
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,774
<i>No. No, it's gone.</i>
<i>It's gone.</i>

323
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,113
No, no,
it can't be gone.

324
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,483
No, no! Nemo!

325
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,121
<i>Nemo! Nemo!</i>

326
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,713
<i>Nemo! Nemo!</i>

327
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,986
No!

328
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,686
Nemo! Nemo!

329
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,526
No! No, please, no!

330
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,528
No, no!

331
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,461
Has anybody seen a boat?

332
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,336
Please! A white boat!

333
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,035
They took my son!

334
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,578
My son! Help me, please.

335
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,478
- Look out!
- What?

336
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,913
Ooh. Ohh.

337
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:27,544
Ohh. Oh, oh. Sorry.
I didn't see you.

338
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:30,885
- Sir? Are you OK?
- He's gone, he's gone.

339
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,356
There, there.
It's all right.

340
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,653
- He's gone.
- It'll be OK.

341
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:37,253
No, no. They took him away.
I have to find the boat.

342
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,355
A boat?
Hey, I've seen a boat.

343
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,696
- You have?
- It passed by not too long ago.

344
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,100
- A white one?
- Hi. I'm Dory.

345
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,330
Where? Which way?

346
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,532
Oh, oh, oh.
It went this way.

347
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:48,972
It went this way.
Follow me.

348
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,375
Thank you. Thank you,
thank you so much.

349
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,537
No problem.

350
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,129
Hey...

351
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,571
Wait!

352
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,772
- Will you quit it?
- What?

353
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,579
I'm trying to swim here.
Ocean isn't big enough for you?

354
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:32,951
You got a problem, buddy?
Huh? Huh?

355
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,816
You got a problem, buddy?
Huh? Huh?

356
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:37,549
Do you? Do you?
You want a piece of me?

357
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,454
Ooh, I'm scared now. What?

358
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:42,085
- Wait a minute.
- Stop following me, OK?

359
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:45,255
What? You're showing me
where the boat went.

360
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:46,899
A boat?
Hey, I've seen a boat.

361
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:50,329
It passed by not too long ago.
It went this way.

362
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,768
It went this way.
Follow me.

363
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,931
Wait a minute.
What is going on?

364
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:56,270
You already told me
which way the boat was going.

365
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:59,505
I did? Oh, no.

366
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,843
If this is some kind of
practical joke, it's not funny.

367
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,178
And I know funny.
I'm a clownfish.

368
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:07,617
No, it's not. I know it's not.
I'm so sorry.

369
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,622
See, I suffer from
short-term memory loss.

370
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:14,490
Short-term memory loss.
I don't believe this.

371
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,391
No, it's true. I forget things
almost instantly.

372
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:20,387
It runs in my family.
At least, I think it does.

373
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:24,459
Um, hmm. Where are they?

374
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,642
Can I help you?

375
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,304
Something's wrong
with you... really.

376
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,210
You're wasting my time.

377
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,306
I have to find my son.

378
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,110
Hello.

379
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,145
- Ohh.
- Well, hi!

380
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:47,215
Name's Bruce.

381
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,022
It's all right.
I understand.

382
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:52,792
Why trust a shark, right?

383
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,966
So, what's a couple
of bites like you...

384
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,669
doing out so late, eh?

385
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,735
We're not doing anything.
We're not even out.

386
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:09,008
Great!
Then how'd you morsels...

387
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:12,312
like to come to a little
get-together I'm having?

388
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,545
You mean, like a party?

389
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:17,646
Yeah, right. A party.
What do you say?

390
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,850
I love parties.
That sounds like fun.

391
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:22,292
Parties are fun,
and it's tempting, but...

392
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:26,229
Oh, come on, I insist.

393
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:29,462
OK.
That's all that matters.

394
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,265
<i>Hey, look, balloons.</i>
<i>It is a party.</i>

395
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,638
Ha ha ha ha!
Mind your distance, though.

396
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,337
Those balloons
can be a bit dodgy.

397
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,676
You wouldn't want
one of them to pop.

398
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,155
Oh.

399
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:54,619
<i>Ohh.</i>

400
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,255
Anchor! Chum!

401
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:01,095
There you are, Bruce.
Finally.

402
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,795
- We got company.
- It's about time, mate.

403
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:04,703
We've already gone
through the snacks...

404
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,294
We've already gone
through the snacks...

405
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:06,895
<i>and I'm still starving.</i>

406
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,134
We almost had a feeding frenzy.

407
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:10,903
Come on,
let's get this over with.

408
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,736
<i>Right, then.</i>

409
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:16,077
The meeting has officially
come to order.

410
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,604
Let us all say the pledge.

411
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:22,143
I am a nice shark,
not a mindless eating machine.

412
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,815
If I am to change this image...

413
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:27,290
<i>I must first change myself.</i>

414
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,056
Fish are friends, not food.

415
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:31,426
Except stinkin' dolphins.

416
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:34,489
Dolphins. Yeah.
They think they're so cute.

417
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,262
"Look at me.
I'm a flippin' little dolphin.

418
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:37,962
"Let me flip for you.
Ain't I something?"

419
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,597
Right, then.
Today's meeting is Step 5...

420
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,300
Bring a Fish Friend.

421
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,831
Do you all have your friends?

422
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,035
Got mine.

423
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:49,038
- Hey, there.
- How about you, Chum?

424
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:53,609
Oh, I... seem to have
misplaced my friend.

425
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,585
<i>That's all right, Chum.</i>

426
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,146
<i>I had a feeling</i>
<i>this would be a difficult step.</i>

427
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,714
<i>You can help yourself</i>
<i>to one of my friends.</i>

428
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:03,216
Thanks, mate.
A little chum for Chum, eh?

429
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,923
<i>I'll start</i>
<i>the testimonies.</i>

430
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:07,193
Hello. My name is Bruce.

431
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:08,494
Hello, Bruce.

432
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,694
It has been three weeks
since my last fish.

433
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:14,172
On my honor, or may I be
chopped up and made into soup.

434
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,970
- You're an inspiration!
- Amen.

435
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,643
Right, then. Who's next?

436
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:20,975
Pick me, pick me.

437
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,878
Yes. The little
Sheila down the front.

438
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,973
- Whoo!
- Come on up here.

439
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,816
Hi. I'm Dory.

440
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:30,253
- Hello, Dory.
- And, uh, well...

441
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,452
I don't think
I've ever eaten a fish.

442
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:37,053
- That's incredible.
- Good on you, mate.

443
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:39,120
I'm glad
I got that off my chest.

444
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:40,495
All right, anyone else?

445
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:43,126
How about you, mate?
What's your problem?

446
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:45,398
Me?
I don't have a problem.

447
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:46,802
Oh, OK.

448
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,430
- Denial.
- Aah!

449
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,304
<i>Just start</i>
<i>with your name.</i>

450
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:53,038
OK. Uh, hello.

451
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:56,172
My name is Marlin.
I'm a clownfish.

452
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:59,240
- A clownfish? Really?
- Tell us a joke.

453
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,013
I love jokes.

454
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:04,045
I actually do know one
that's pretty good.

455
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,114
There was this mollusk...

456
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,490
and he walks up
to a sea cucumber.

457
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,358
Normally, they don't talk,
sea cucumbers...

458
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,363
but in a joke,
everyone talks...

459
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:15,457
so the sea mollusk
says to the cucumber...

460
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,763
Daddy!

461
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,136
Nemo!

462
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,199
Nemo! Ha ha! Nemo!
I don't get it.

463
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,142
For a clownfish,
he's not that funny.

464
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,009
No, no, no, no.
He's my son.

465
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:30,105
He was taken by these divers.

466
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:32,844
Oh, my. You poor fish.

467
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:34,852
Humans... think they own
everything.

468
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:36,148
Probably American.

469
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,189
Now, there is a father...
Looking for his little boy.

470
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,317
Now, there is a father...
Looking for his little boy.

471
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,850
What do
these markings mean?

472
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,226
I never knew my father!

473
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:47,663
- Group hug.
- We're all mates here, mate.

474
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,927
I can't read human.

475
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:50,229
We got to find a fish
that can read this.

476
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,236
- Hey, look, sharks.
- No, no, no, Dory!

477
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,397
- Guys, guys.
- No, Dory.

478
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:55,770
That's mine.
Give it to me.

479
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,274
Gimme! Ow!

480
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,277
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you OK?

481
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,709
- Ow, ow, ow.
- I'm so sorry.

482
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,873
You really clocked me there.
Am I bleeding?

483
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:04,814
- Ohh.
- Ow, ow, ow.

484
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,411
Dory, are you OK... Ohh.

485
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:09,254
Ohh, that's good.

486
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,984
Ohh, that's good.

487
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:13,923
Intervention!

488
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,553
- Just a bite.
- Hold it together, mate!

489
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:19,223
Remember, Bruce,
fish are friends, not food!

490
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:21,366
- Food!
- Dory, look out!

491
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:22,162
- Food!
- Dory, look out!

492
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,761
- Aah!
- I'm having fish tonight!

493
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,396
Remember the steps, mate!

494
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,964
Aah!

495
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:33,171
- Aah! Whoa!
- Aah!

496
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:35,475
- Just one bite!
- Aah!

497
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:42,316
G'day. Grr!

498
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:44,617
There's no way out!

499
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:46,419
There's got to be a way
to escape!

500
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:49,961
Who is it?

501
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:51,326
Dory, help me
find a way out!

502
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,888
Sorry. Come back later.
We're trying to escape.

503
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:58,500
- There's got to be a way out!
- Here's something.

504
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:01,267
"Es-cap-e."
I wonder what that means.

505
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:02,830
Funny. It's spelled
just like "escape."

506
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,136
- Let's go.
- Aah!

507
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:07,270
Here's Brucey!

508
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:09,007
Wait a minute.
You can read?

509
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,038
I can read?
That's right. I can read!

510
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:13,209
Well, then, here.
Read this now.

511
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:15,219
- Aah!
- Ohh!

512
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:18,017
He really doesn't mean it.
He never even knew his father.

513
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:19,284
<i>Don't fall off the wagon!</i>

514
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:20,882
- Aah!
- Aah!

515
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:25,797
Oh, no, it's blocked!

516
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,332
No, Bruce, focus.

517
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:33,496
Sorry about Bruce, mate.

518
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:36,200
He's really a nice guy.

519
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:37,469
I need to get that mask.

520
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,101
You want that mask? OK.

521
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,908
No, no, no, no, no, no!

522
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:44,472
Quick, grab the mask!

523
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:51,186
Oh, no. Bruce?

524
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,850
What?

525
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,424
Swim away! Swim away!

526
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:59,191
Aw, is the party over?

527
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,474
Nice.

528
00:25:13,569 --> 00:25:14,729
Dad?

529
00:25:17,573 --> 00:25:18,767
Daddy?

530
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,204
Huh?

531
00:25:23,546 --> 00:25:26,572
Aah! Uhh!

532
00:25:29,085 --> 00:25:30,279
Uhh!

533
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,564
<i>- Barbara.</i>
<i>- Uh-huh?</i>

534
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:45,430
Prep for his anterior crown,
would you, please?

535
00:25:45,468 --> 00:25:47,902
<i>And I'm going to need</i>
<i>a few more cotton rolls.</i>

536
00:25:47,937 --> 00:25:49,564
<i>OK.</i>

537
00:25:51,307 --> 00:25:53,036
Hello, little fella.

538
00:25:53,075 --> 00:25:54,269
Aah!

539
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,470
<i>Heh heh heh!</i>
<i>Beauty, isn't he?</i>

540
00:25:55,511 --> 00:25:56,842
I found that guy
struggling for life...

541
00:25:56,879 --> 00:25:58,574
out on the reef,
and I saved him.

542
00:25:58,614 --> 00:26:00,707
So, has that Novocaine
kicked in yet?

543
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,947
<i>I think so.</i>
<i>We're ready to roll.</i>

544
00:26:05,187 --> 00:26:06,711
Bubbles!

545
00:26:09,692 --> 00:26:11,284
My bubbles.

546
00:26:11,327 --> 00:26:12,692
He likes bubbles.

547
00:26:12,728 --> 00:26:16,425
Aah! Ohh! No! Uhh!

548
00:26:24,206 --> 00:26:25,434
- Bonjour.
- Aah!

549
00:26:25,474 --> 00:26:29,274
Slow down, little fella.
There's nothing to worry about.

550
00:26:29,311 --> 00:26:32,542
- He's scared to death.
- I want to go home.

551
00:26:32,581 --> 00:26:34,606
Do you know where my dad is?

552
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:37,414
Honey, your dad's probably
back at the pet store.

553
00:26:37,453 --> 00:26:38,613
Pet store?

554
00:26:38,654 --> 00:26:41,350
Yeah, you know, like,
I'm from Bob's Fish Mart.

555
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,948
- Pet Palace.
- Fish-O-Rama.

556
00:26:42,992 --> 00:26:44,459
- Mail order.
- Ebay.

557
00:26:44,493 --> 00:26:47,189
- So, which one is it?
- I'm from the ocean.

558
00:26:47,229 --> 00:26:49,163
Ah, the ocean. The ocean?

559
00:26:49,198 --> 00:26:51,098
Aah! Aah! Aah!

560
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:53,829
He hasn't been decontaminated.
Jacques!

561
00:26:53,869 --> 00:26:55,200
<i>- Oui.</i>
<i>- Clean him!</i>

562
00:26:55,237 --> 00:26:56,761
<i>Oui.</i>

563
00:26:56,806 --> 00:26:59,240
- Ocean.
- Ooh, la mer. Bon.

564
00:27:01,076 --> 00:27:03,203
Voila. He is clean.

565
00:27:05,681 --> 00:27:08,946
Wow. The big blue.
What's it like?

566
00:27:08,984 --> 00:27:13,011
- Big and blue?
- I knew it.

567
00:27:13,055 --> 00:27:16,252
If there's anything you need,
just ask your Auntie Deb.

568
00:27:16,292 --> 00:27:19,386
Or if I'm not around,
you can talk to my sister Flo.

569
00:27:19,428 --> 00:27:21,191
Hi. How are you?

570
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,754
Don't listen to anything
my sister says.

571
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:24,629
She's nuts.
Ha ha ha ha!

572
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:25,759
We got a live one.

573
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:28,827
- Can't hear you, Peach.
- I said we got a live one.

574
00:27:28,871 --> 00:27:30,839
- Boy, oh, boy.
- What do we got?

575
00:27:30,873 --> 00:27:32,397
Root canal... and by the looks
of those x-rays...

576
00:27:32,441 --> 00:27:33,908
it's not going to be pretty.

577
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,638
Ow!

578
00:27:35,678 --> 00:27:37,111
- Dam and clamp installed?
- Yep.

579
00:27:37,146 --> 00:27:38,943
- What did he use to open?
- Gator-Glidden drill.

580
00:27:38,981 --> 00:27:40,642
<i>He seems to favor</i>
<i>that one lately.</i>

581
00:27:40,683 --> 00:27:43,618
I can't see, Flo.

582
00:27:43,652 --> 00:27:45,779
You're getting
a little too... Aah!

583
00:27:45,821 --> 00:27:47,015
Now he's doing
the Schilder technique.

584
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:48,455
He's using
a Hedstrom file.

585
00:27:48,491 --> 00:27:50,686
That's not a Hedstrom file.
That's a K-Flex.

586
00:27:50,726 --> 00:27:53,354
It has a teardrop cross-section.
Clearly a Hedstrom.

587
00:27:53,395 --> 00:27:54,885
- No, no, K-Flex.
- Hedstrom.

588
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,625
- K-Flex!
- Hedstrom!

589
00:27:56,665 --> 00:27:58,724
There I go.
A little help, over here.

590
00:27:58,834 --> 00:28:00,631
I'll go deflate him.

591
00:28:03,072 --> 00:28:05,233
All right.
Go ahead and rinse.

592
00:28:05,274 --> 00:28:08,607
Oh, the human mouth
is a disgusting place.

593
00:28:11,046 --> 00:28:12,980
- Hey, Nigel.
- What did I miss?

594
00:28:13,015 --> 00:28:14,175
Root canal... a doozy.

595
00:28:14,216 --> 00:28:15,843
Root canal?
What did he use to open?

596
00:28:15,885 --> 00:28:17,910
- Gator-Glidden drill.
- He's favoring that one.

597
00:28:17,953 --> 00:28:20,945
Hope he doesn't get surplus
sealer at the portal terminus.

598
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,084
- Hello. Who's this?
- New guy. Ha ha ha!

599
00:28:24,126 --> 00:28:25,457
The dentist
took him off the reef.

600
00:28:25,494 --> 00:28:27,860
An outie. From my neck
of the woods, eh?

601
00:28:27,897 --> 00:28:29,387
Sorry if I ever took
a snap at you.

602
00:28:29,431 --> 00:28:30,830
Fish gotta swim,
birds gotta eat.

603
00:28:30,866 --> 00:28:32,561
Hey! No, no, no, no!

604
00:28:32,601 --> 00:28:34,193
They're not your fish.
They're my fish.

605
00:28:34,236 --> 00:28:37,034
Come on, go.
Go on, shoo!

606
00:28:38,374 --> 00:28:40,035
Aw, the picture broke.

607
00:28:40,075 --> 00:28:42,134
This here's Darla.
She's my niece.

608
00:28:42,177 --> 00:28:43,644
She's going to be
eight this week.

609
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,146
Hey, little fella.

610
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,943
<i>Say hello</i>
<i>to your new mummy.</i>

611
00:28:46,982 --> 00:28:49,450
She'll be here Friday
to pick you up.

612
00:28:49,485 --> 00:28:51,316
You're her present.
Shh, shh, shh.

613
00:28:51,353 --> 00:28:53,412
<i>It's our little secret.</i>

614
00:28:53,455 --> 00:28:54,979
Well, Mr. Tucker,
while that sets up...

615
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,992
I'm going to see a man
about a wallaby.

616
00:28:58,827 --> 00:29:00,727
Oh, Darla.

617
00:29:00,763 --> 00:29:02,628
What?
What's wrong with her?

618
00:29:02,665 --> 00:29:05,361
<i>She wouldn't stop</i>
<i>shaking the bag.</i>

619
00:29:05,401 --> 00:29:09,167
- Poor Chuckles.
- He was her present last year.

620
00:29:09,204 --> 00:29:11,570
<i>Hitched a ride</i>
<i>on the porcelain express.</i>

621
00:29:13,442 --> 00:29:15,637
<i>She's a fish killer.</i>

622
00:29:15,678 --> 00:29:17,942
I can't go with that girl.

623
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,743
I have to get back
to my dad.

624
00:29:19,782 --> 00:29:23,684
Aah! Daddy! Help me!

625
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:24,879
Oh, he's stuck.

626
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,115
<i>Nobody touch him.</i>

627
00:29:29,391 --> 00:29:31,359
Nobody touch him.

628
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:38,532
Can you help me?

629
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:38,934
No. You got yourself
in there.

630
00:29:38,934 --> 00:29:40,561
No. You got yourself
in there.

631
00:29:40,603 --> 00:29:42,264
You can get yourself out.

632
00:29:42,304 --> 00:29:44,568
- Gill...
- I want to see him do it.

633
00:29:44,607 --> 00:29:48,441
Calm down. Alternate wiggling
your fins and your tail.

634
00:29:48,477 --> 00:29:51,275
I can't. I have a bad fin.

635
00:29:51,313 --> 00:29:53,474
Never stopped me.

636
00:29:57,553 --> 00:30:00,113
Just think about
what you need to do.

637
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,617
Come on.

638
00:30:09,832 --> 00:30:11,026
Perfect.

639
00:30:11,066 --> 00:30:12,431
- Yay!
- You did it!

640
00:30:12,468 --> 00:30:14,231
Good squirming.
Ha ha ha!

641
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:17,864
Wow. From the ocean...
just like you, Gill.

642
00:30:17,906 --> 00:30:19,066
Yeah.

643
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,474
I've seen that look before.

644
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,171
What are you thinking about?

645
00:30:23,212 --> 00:30:24,975
I'm thinking...

646
00:30:25,014 --> 00:30:28,575
tonight, we give the kid
a proper reception.

647
00:30:28,617 --> 00:30:30,278
So, kid,
you got a name or what?

648
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:33,015
Nemo. I'm Nemo.

649
00:30:35,157 --> 00:30:37,625
Nemo. Nemo.

650
00:30:42,831 --> 00:30:44,526
Are you gonna eat that?

651
00:30:56,078 --> 00:30:59,741
- Careful with that hammer.
- Huh?

652
00:31:02,251 --> 00:31:05,015
No, no.

653
00:31:05,054 --> 00:31:07,284
What does it say? Dory!

654
00:31:07,322 --> 00:31:08,949
A sea monkey has my money.

655
00:31:08,991 --> 00:31:11,255
Wake up. Get up. Come on.

656
00:31:11,293 --> 00:31:12,260
Come on!

657
00:31:12,294 --> 00:31:14,524
- Yes, I'm a natural blue.
- Get up!

658
00:31:14,563 --> 00:31:17,794
Look out!
Sharks eat fish! Aah!

659
00:31:21,937 --> 00:31:23,871
- Aah!
- Aah!

660
00:31:29,978 --> 00:31:32,037
Aah!

661
00:31:39,888 --> 00:31:41,947
Wow. Dusty.

662
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:43,514
The mask.
Where's the mask?

663
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:47,094
No! No, not the mask!

664
00:31:47,129 --> 00:31:49,654
Get it! Get the mask!
Get the mask! Get it!

665
00:31:53,836 --> 00:31:56,327
<i>Hoo doot doo doot</i>
<i>doot doo doot</i>

666
00:31:56,371 --> 00:31:57,770
Whoo-hoo!

667
00:31:57,806 --> 00:31:59,364
<i>La la la la la la</i>

668
00:31:59,408 --> 00:32:01,137
<i>It just keeps going on,</i>
<i>doesn't it?</i>

669
00:32:01,176 --> 00:32:03,576
<i>Echo! Echo!</i>

670
00:32:03,612 --> 00:32:04,840
Hey, what you doing?

671
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,142
It's gone.
I've lost the mask.

672
00:32:06,181 --> 00:32:08,206
- Did you drop it?
- You dropped it!

673
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,842
That was my only chance
of finding my son.

674
00:32:09,885 --> 00:32:12,183
Now it's gone.

675
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:18,658
Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills...

676
00:32:18,694 --> 00:32:20,286
when life gets you down,
know what you got to do?

677
00:32:20,329 --> 00:32:22,763
- I don't want to know.
- Just keep swimming.

678
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:26,234
<i>Just keep swimming,</i>
<i>swimming, swimming</i>

679
00:32:26,268 --> 00:32:28,498
<i>What do we do?</i>
<i>We swim, swim</i>

680
00:32:28,537 --> 00:32:29,765
Dory, no singing.

681
00:32:29,805 --> 00:32:31,602
<i>Ho ho ho ho ho ho</i>

682
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,234
<i>I love to swim</i>

683
00:32:34,276 --> 00:32:36,710
<i>When you want to swim</i>

684
00:32:36,745 --> 00:32:38,736
See, I'm going to get
stuck now with that song.

685
00:32:38,781 --> 00:32:43,018
- Now it's in my head.
- Sorry.

686
00:32:43,018 --> 00:32:44,451
Dory, do you see anything?

687
00:32:44,486 --> 00:32:46,215
- Aah! Something's got me.
- That was me. I'm sorry.

688
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:49,622
- Who's that?
- Who could it be? It's me.

689
00:32:49,658 --> 00:32:52,923
Are you my conscience?

690
00:32:52,961 --> 00:32:55,589
Yeah, yeah.
I'm your conscience.

691
00:32:55,631 --> 00:32:58,532
We haven't spoken for a while.
How are you?

692
00:32:58,567 --> 00:33:00,831
- Can't complain.
- Yeah? Good.

693
00:33:00,869 --> 00:33:02,598
Now, Dory,
I want you to tell me...

694
00:33:02,638 --> 00:33:04,367
Do you see anything?

695
00:33:04,406 --> 00:33:08,001
I see a... I see a light.

696
00:33:08,043 --> 00:33:10,603
- A light?
- Yeah. Over there.

697
00:33:10,646 --> 00:33:14,104
- Hey, conscience, am I dead?
- No. I see it, too.

698
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,781
What is it?

699
00:33:23,826 --> 00:33:28,627
It's so pretty.

700
00:33:28,664 --> 00:33:33,465
I'm feeling... happy...

701
00:33:33,502 --> 00:33:36,994
which is a big deal for me.

702
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,529
I want to touch it.

703
00:33:38,574 --> 00:33:40,098
- Oh.
- Ooh.

704
00:33:40,142 --> 00:33:42,542
Hey, come back.
Come on back here.

705
00:33:42,578 --> 00:33:44,136
<i>I'm gonna get you</i>

706
00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:45,942
I'm gonna get you.

707
00:33:45,981 --> 00:33:47,243
<i>I'm gonna swim with you</i>

708
00:33:47,282 --> 00:33:48,647
I'm gonna get you.

709
00:33:48,684 --> 00:33:51,551
<i>I'm gonna be</i>
<i>your best friend</i>

710
00:33:51,587 --> 00:33:52,747
Good feeling's gone.

711
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:57,051
- Whoa!
- Waah!

712
00:33:59,595 --> 00:34:02,359
I can't see!
I don't know where I'm going!

713
00:34:02,397 --> 00:34:03,365
<i>Haah!</i>

714
00:34:03,365 --> 00:34:04,229
<i>Haah!</i>

715
00:34:04,266 --> 00:34:06,234
- The mask!
- What mask?

716
00:34:06,268 --> 00:34:08,566
OK, I can't see a thing.

717
00:34:09,972 --> 00:34:12,270
- Oh, gee.
- Hey, look, a mask.

718
00:34:12,307 --> 00:34:13,968
Read it!

719
00:34:14,009 --> 00:34:15,636
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>but if you could just...</i>

720
00:34:15,677 --> 00:34:17,212
<i>bring it a little closer,</i>
<i>I kind of need the light.</i>

721
00:34:17,212 --> 00:34:17,610
<i>Bring it a little closer,</i>
<i>I kind of need the light.</i>

722
00:34:17,646 --> 00:34:20,581
That's great.
Keep it right there.

723
00:34:20,616 --> 00:34:23,346
- Just read it!
- OK, OK.

724
00:34:23,385 --> 00:34:26,411
Mr. Bossy. Uh, "P."

725
00:34:26,455 --> 00:34:29,424
<i>OK. "P. Sher..."</i>

726
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:32,552
"Sher... P. Sher..."
P. Shirley? P..."

727
00:34:34,463 --> 00:34:36,761
Oh. The first line's
"P. Sherman."

728
00:34:36,798 --> 00:34:38,993
"P. Sherman"
doesn't make any sense!

729
00:34:39,034 --> 00:34:41,264
OK. Second line. "42."

730
00:34:41,303 --> 00:34:43,271
Don't eat me.
Don't eat me. Aah!

731
00:34:45,007 --> 00:34:46,599
<i>Light, please!</i>

732
00:34:47,976 --> 00:34:50,536
<i>"Walla... walla..."</i>

733
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:53,480
Waah! Waah! Waah!

734
00:34:53,515 --> 00:34:55,278
The second line's
"42 Wallaby Way."

735
00:34:55,317 --> 00:34:58,115
That's great.
Speed read. Take a guess.

736
00:34:58,153 --> 00:34:59,780
<i>No pressure. No problem.</i>
<i>There's a lot of pressure.</i>

737
00:34:59,821 --> 00:35:02,346
Pressure! Take a guess
now with pressure!

738
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:05,485
- "Sydney"! It's "Sydney"!
- Duck!

739
00:35:05,527 --> 00:35:07,461
Aah!

740
00:35:07,496 --> 00:35:10,897
I'm dead.
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.

741
00:35:10,933 --> 00:35:12,298
I died. I'm dead.

742
00:35:19,308 --> 00:35:20,639
Whoo-hoo!

743
00:35:20,676 --> 00:35:22,473
<i>We did it, we did it</i>

744
00:35:22,511 --> 00:35:24,206
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

745
00:35:24,246 --> 00:35:26,077
<i>No eating here</i>
<i>tonight, whoo!</i>

746
00:35:26,114 --> 00:35:27,479
<i>Eating here tonight</i>

747
00:35:27,516 --> 00:35:28,813
<i>No, no, no,</i>
<i>eating here tonight</i>

748
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:30,317
- Dory.
- You on a diet

749
00:35:30,352 --> 00:35:33,185
Dory!
What did the mask say?

750
00:35:33,221 --> 00:35:35,052
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

751
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:37,217
I remembered what it said!

752
00:35:37,259 --> 00:35:39,750
I usually forget things,
but I remembered it!

753
00:35:39,795 --> 00:35:41,456
Whoa, whoa, wait.
Where is that?

754
00:35:41,496 --> 00:35:43,930
I don't know.
But who cares? I remembered.

755
00:35:43,966 --> 00:35:45,160
- Raar!
- Aah!

756
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,430
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

757
00:35:47,469 --> 00:35:49,494
I remembered it again!

758
00:36:16,198 --> 00:36:19,190
<i>Psst. Nemo.</i>

759

00:37:43,051 --> 00:37:48,353
to join with us in
the fraternal bonds of tankhood.

791
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:51,291
- Huh?
- We want you in our club, kid.

792
00:37:51,326 --> 00:37:52,520
- Really?
- Lf...

793
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:55,826
you are able to swim through...

794
00:37:55,864 --> 00:38:00,324
The Ring of Fire!

795
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,670
Turn on the Ring of Fire!

796
00:38:05,707 --> 00:38:07,334
<i>You said you could do it.</i>

797
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:08,967
The Ring of Fire!

798
00:38:11,346 --> 00:38:13,473
Bubbles, let me... Oh!

799
00:38:13,515 --> 00:38:16,279
<i>Ha hwa ha ho ho ho</i>

800
00:38:16,318 --> 00:38:18,650
<i>Ha hwa ha ho ho ho</i>

801
00:38:18,687 --> 00:38:21,019
<i>Ha hwa ha ho ho ho</i>

802
00:38:21,056 --> 00:38:24,150
Isn't there another way?
He's just a boy!

803
00:38:34,536 --> 00:38:39,633
From this moment on,
you will be known as Sharkbait.

804
00:38:39,674 --> 00:38:41,005
Sharkbait, oo-ha-ha!

805
00:38:41,042 --> 00:38:42,805
Welcome,
Brother Sharkbait.

806
00:38:42,844 --> 00:38:44,072
Sharkbait, oo-ha-ha!

807
00:38:44,112 --> 00:38:46,137
- Enough with the Sharkbait.
- Sharkbait!

808
00:38:46,181 --> 00:38:48,046
Ooh... ba-ba-do.

809
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:49,641
Sharkbait's
one of us now, agreed?

810
00:38:49,684 --> 00:38:51,743
- Agreed.
- We can't send him to his death.

811
00:38:51,786 --> 00:38:53,879
Darla's coming in five days.

812
00:38:53,922 --> 00:38:55,480
So, what are we going to do?

813
00:38:55,524 --> 00:38:58,084
I'll tell you
what we're gonna do...

814
00:38:58,126 --> 00:38:59,684
we're gonna get him
out of here.

815
00:38:59,728 --> 00:39:02,253
- We'll help him escape.
- Escape? Really?

816
00:39:02,297 --> 00:39:03,764
We're all gonna escape.

817
00:39:03,798 --> 00:39:06,426
Gill, please.
Not another escape plan.

818
00:39:06,468 --> 00:39:08,493
Sorry,
but they just never work.

819
00:39:08,537 --> 00:39:09,671
Why should this
be any different?

820
00:39:09,671 --> 00:39:10,069
Why should this
be any different?

821
00:39:10,105 --> 00:39:13,563
- Because we've got him.
- Me?

822
00:39:13,608 --> 00:39:15,377
- You see that filter?
- Yeah.

823
00:39:15,377 --> 00:39:18,813
<i>You're the only one who can get</i>
<i>in and out of that thing.</i>

824
00:39:18,847 --> 00:39:22,010
<i>We need you to take</i>
<i>a pebble inside there...</i>

825
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,278
<i>and jam the gears.</i>

826
00:39:23,318 --> 00:39:25,286
<i>You do that,</i>
<i>and this tank's gonna get...</i>

827
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,288
<i>filthier and filthier</i>
<i>by the minute.</i>

828
00:39:27,322 --> 00:39:29,654
<i>Pretty soon, the dentist'll</i>
<i>have to clean the tank...</i>

829
00:39:29,691 --> 00:39:32,592
<i>and when he does, he'll take us</i>
<i>out of the tank...</i>

830
00:39:32,627 --> 00:39:34,185
<i>put us in</i>
<i>individual baggies...</i>

831
00:39:34,229 --> 00:39:36,026
<i>then we'll roll ourselves</i>
<i>down the counter...</i>

832
00:39:36,064 --> 00:39:37,725
<i>out the window,</i>
<i>off the awning...</i>

833
00:39:37,766 --> 00:39:39,427
<i>into the bushes,</i>
<i>across the street...</i>

834
00:39:39,467 --> 00:39:41,935
<i>and into the harbor!</i>

835
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:44,905
It's foolproof.
Who's with me?

836
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,339
- Aye!
- Aye!

837
00:39:46,374 --> 00:39:47,807
I think you're nuts.

838
00:39:48,977 --> 00:39:51,810
No offense, kid,
but you're not the best swimmer.

839
00:39:51,846 --> 00:39:54,246
He's fine. He can do this.

840
00:39:54,282 --> 00:39:57,740
So, Sharkbait,
what do you think?

841
00:39:57,786 --> 00:40:02,724
Let's do it.

842
00:40:02,724 --> 00:40:05,693
I'm going to P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

843
00:40:05,727 --> 00:40:07,024
Where are you going?

844
00:40:07,062 --> 00:40:08,723
I'm going to P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

845
00:40:08,763 --> 00:40:10,390
If you ask
where I'm going...

846
00:40:10,432 --> 00:40:12,161
I'll tell you
that's where I'm going.

847
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,667
It's P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

848
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:15,465
Where? I'm sorry,
I didn't hear you.

849
00:40:15,503 --> 00:40:17,061
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

850
00:40:17,105 --> 00:40:19,903
Excuse me.

851
00:40:19,941 --> 00:40:21,738
Hi.
Do you know how to get...

852
00:40:21,776 --> 00:40:24,745
Hello? Whoa. Wait.
Can you tell me...

853
00:40:24,779 --> 00:40:29,113
Hey! Hold it!
I'm trying to talk to you!

854
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:32,517
Fellas, come back here.
One quick question.

855
00:40:32,554 --> 00:40:36,957
I need to...
And they're gone again.

856
00:40:36,992 --> 00:40:38,755
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

857
00:40:38,793 --> 00:40:40,454
Why do I have to tell you
over and over again?

858
00:40:40,495 --> 00:40:42,486
I'll tell you again.
I don't get tired of it...

859
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:43,690
- OK, all right.
- Huh?

860
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,427
- Here's the thing.
- Uh-huh.

861
00:40:45,467 --> 00:40:50,962
I think it's best
if I carry on from here by...

862
00:40:51,006 --> 00:40:52,371
by myself.

863
00:40:52,407 --> 00:40:53,601
OK.

864
00:40:53,642 --> 00:40:55,337
- You know, alone.
- Uh-huh.

865
00:40:55,377 --> 00:40:57,402
Without... without...
I mean, not without you.

866
00:40:57,445 --> 00:41:00,812
But I don't
want you... with me.

867
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:03,181
- Huh?
- Am I...

868
00:41:03,218 --> 00:41:04,378
I don't want to hurt
your feelings.

869
00:41:04,419 --> 00:41:07,217
- You want me to leave?
- I mean, not... Yes.

870
00:41:07,255 --> 00:41:09,689
I just can't afford
any more delays...

871
00:41:09,724 --> 00:41:12,921
and you're one of those fish
that cause delays.

872
00:41:12,961 --> 00:41:14,588
Sometimes it's a good thing.

873
00:41:14,629 --> 00:41:17,655
There's a whole group of fish.
They're delay fish.

874
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:19,257
You mean...

875
00:41:19,301 --> 00:41:20,962
You mean you don't like me?

876
00:41:21,002 --> 00:41:22,799
No, of course I like you.

877
00:41:22,837 --> 00:41:25,533
It's because I like you
I don't want to be with you.

878
00:41:25,573 --> 00:41:27,734
It's a complicated emotion.

879
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:31,473
- Ohh!
- Don't cry. I like you.

880
00:41:31,513 --> 00:41:35,882
Hey, you!
Lady, is this guy bothering you?

881
00:41:35,917 --> 00:41:37,851
Um... I don't remember.
Were you?

882
00:41:37,886 --> 00:41:39,786
No, no, no, no, no.
We're just...

883
00:41:39,821 --> 00:41:41,584
Do you guys know
how I can get to...

884
00:41:41,623 --> 00:41:43,955
Look, pal, we're talking
to the lady, not you.

885
00:41:43,992 --> 00:41:45,584
Hey, hey.
You like impressions?

886
00:41:45,627 --> 00:41:47,652
Mm-hmm.

887
00:41:47,696 --> 00:41:50,028
Just like in rehearsals,
gentlemen.

888
00:41:50,065 --> 00:41:51,623
So what are we?
Take a guess.

889
00:41:51,666 --> 00:41:52,963
Oh, oh.
I've seen one of those.

890
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:55,196
I'm a fish with a nose
like a sword.

891
00:41:55,236 --> 00:41:57,204
- Wait, wait, um...
- It's a swordfish!

892
00:41:57,238 --> 00:41:59,007
Hey, clown boy,
let the lady guess.

893
00:41:59,007 --> 00:42:00,269
Hey, clown boy,
let the lady guess.

894
00:42:00,308 --> 00:42:01,866
Where's the butter?

895
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,309
Ooh! It's on
the tip of my tongue!

896
00:42:03,345 --> 00:42:05,336
- Lobster.
- Saw that!

897
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,211
Lots of legs!
Live in the ocean.

898
00:42:07,248 --> 00:42:08,647
- Clam!
- Close enough!

899
00:42:08,683 --> 00:42:10,173
<i>Oh, it's a whale</i>
<i>of a tale</i>

900
00:42:10,218 --> 00:42:11,685
<i>I'll tell you, lad...</i>

901
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,709
They're good.

902
00:42:12,754 --> 00:42:14,051
Will somebody please
give me directions?!

903
00:42:14,089 --> 00:42:16,455
"Will somebody please
give me directions?!"

904
00:42:16,491 --> 00:42:18,516
- Ha ha ha ha ha!
- I'm serious!

905
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,551
"Blah blah blah,
me, me, blah!

906
00:42:20,595 --> 00:42:21,789
"Blah blah blah,
me, me, me!"

907
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,320
Thank you.

908
00:42:23,365 --> 00:42:25,856
Oh, dear. Hey!
Hey, come back!

909
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,036
- Hey, what's the matter?
- What's the matter?

910
00:42:28,036 --> 00:42:28,559
- Hey, what's the matter?
- What's the matter?

911
00:42:28,603 --> 00:42:30,571
While they're doing their
silly little impressions...

912
00:42:30,605 --> 00:42:34,735
I am miles from home with a fish
that can't remember her name!

913
00:42:34,776 --> 00:42:36,073
I bet that's frustrating.

914
00:42:36,111 --> 00:42:37,544
Meanwhile,
my son is out there.

915
00:42:37,579 --> 00:42:39,570
- Your son Chico?
- Nemo?

916
00:42:39,614 --> 00:42:41,013
But it doesn't matter
because no fish...

917
00:42:41,049 --> 00:42:43,017
in this entire ocean
is going to help me.

918
00:42:43,051 --> 00:42:46,817
Well, I'm helping you.

919
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:48,186
Wait right here.

920
00:42:49,424 --> 00:42:52,018
- Guys!
- Is he bothering you again?

921
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,584
No, no. He's a good guy.

922
00:42:53,628 --> 00:42:54,629
Go easy on him.
He's lost his son Fabio.

923
00:42:54,629 --> 00:42:55,857
Go easy on him.
He's lost his son Fabio.

924
00:42:55,897 --> 00:42:58,764
Any of you heard of P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

925
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:01,495
Sydney? Oh, sure!

926
00:43:01,536 --> 00:43:03,265
Ted here's got relatives
in Sydney.

927
00:43:03,304 --> 00:43:04,931
- Don't you, Ted?
- Sure do!

928
00:43:04,973 --> 00:43:06,463
Oh! Hey!
They know Sydney!

929
00:43:07,709 --> 00:43:09,199
You wouldn't know how
to get there, would you?

930
00:43:09,244 --> 00:43:11,212
You want to follow the E.A.C.

931
00:43:11,246 --> 00:43:13,942
That's the East
Australian Current.

932
00:43:13,982 --> 00:43:15,609
Big current.
Can't miss it.

933
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:18,619
It's in... that direction.

934
00:43:18,653 --> 00:43:20,553
And then you follow that
for about...

935
00:43:20,588 --> 00:43:22,351
I don't know.
What do you guys think?

936
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:23,550
About three leagues?

937
00:43:23,591 --> 00:43:26,560
That little baby will put you
right past Sydney.

938
00:43:26,594 --> 00:43:29,028
- Ta-da!
- That's great!

939
00:43:29,063 --> 00:43:30,257
Dory, you did it!

940
00:43:30,298 --> 00:43:32,129
Oh, please,
I'm just your little helper.

941
00:43:32,167 --> 00:43:34,499
- Helping along. That's me.
- Fellas, thank you.

942
00:43:34,536 --> 00:43:38,165
Don't mention it!
Just loosen up, OK, buddy?

943
00:43:38,206 --> 00:43:41,198
Oh, you guys.
You really nailed him. Bye.

944
00:43:41,242 --> 00:43:43,073
Oh, hey, ma'am.
One more thing.

945
00:43:43,111 --> 00:43:46,672
When you come to this trench,
swim through it, not over it.

946
00:43:46,714 --> 00:43:48,614
Trench...
through it, not over it.

947
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:51,346
I'll remember. Hey, hey!

948
00:43:52,787 --> 00:43:55,051
Hey, wait up, partner!
Hold on!

949
00:43:55,089 --> 00:43:57,819
Wait, wait, wait!
I gotta tell you something.

950
00:43:57,859 --> 00:44:00,555
Whoa.

951
00:44:00,595 --> 00:44:02,893
<i>Nice trench.</i>

952
00:44:04,632 --> 00:44:07,624
Hello!

953
00:44:10,338 --> 00:44:12,966
- OK, let's go.
- No, no. Bad trench.

954
00:44:13,007 --> 00:44:14,668
Come on, we'll swim over
this thing.

955
00:44:14,709 --> 00:44:16,836
Whoa, partner.
Little red flag going up.

956
00:44:16,878 --> 00:44:20,507
Something's telling me
to swim through it, not over it.

957
00:44:20,548 --> 00:44:22,175
Are you looking at this thing?

958
00:44:22,217 --> 00:44:23,707
It's got death
written all over it.

959
00:44:23,751 --> 00:44:26,584
I really, really, really
think we should swim through.

960
00:44:26,621 --> 00:44:28,851
And I'm really, really done
talking about this. Over we go.

961
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:30,858
- Trust me on this.
- Trust you?

962
00:44:30,892 --> 00:44:32,757
Yes, trust.
It's what friends do.

963
00:44:32,794 --> 00:44:34,694
Look! Something shiny!

964
00:44:34,729 --> 00:44:36,492
- Where?
- It just swam over the trench.

965
00:44:36,531 --> 00:44:42,237
- Come on, we'll follow it!
- OK!

966
00:44:42,237 --> 00:44:44,899
Boy, it sure is clear up here.

967
00:44:44,939 --> 00:44:48,397
Exactly. And look at that...
there's the current.

968
00:44:48,443 --> 00:44:51,037
We should be there in no time.

969
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:52,876
Hey, little guy.

970
00:44:52,914 --> 00:44:54,677
You wanted to go
through the trench.

971
00:44:54,716 --> 00:44:56,741
I shall call him Squishy,
and he shall be mine.

972
00:44:56,784 --> 00:44:58,945
And he shall be my Squishy.
Come here, Squishy.

973
00:44:59,053 --> 00:45:00,486
Come here, little Squishy.

974
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:03,518
Ow!

975
00:45:03,558 --> 00:45:06,425
- That's a jellyfish!
- Bad Squishy!

976
00:45:06,461 --> 00:45:08,258
Shoo, shoo! Get away!

977
00:45:08,296 --> 00:45:10,594
- Let me see that.
- Don't touch it.

978
00:45:10,632 --> 00:45:12,964
I won't touch it.
I just want to look.

979
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:15,026
Hey! How come
it didn't sting you?

980
00:45:15,069 --> 00:45:16,593
It did.
It's just that...

981
00:45:16,638 --> 00:45:18,333
- Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Hold still.

982
00:45:18,373 --> 00:45:19,840
I live in this anemone...

983
00:45:19,874 --> 00:45:21,739
and I'm used
to these kind of stings.

984
00:45:21,776 --> 00:45:22,936
Ow! Ow! Ow!

985
00:45:22,977 --> 00:45:24,968
It doesn't look bad.
You'll be fine.

986
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:26,742
But now we know, don't we...

987
00:45:26,781 --> 00:45:28,976
that we don't want
to touch these again.

988
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:32,043
Let's be thankful this time
it was just a little one.

989
00:45:32,086 --> 00:45:34,486
- Aah!
- Aah!

990
00:45:34,522 --> 00:45:35,784
Don't move.

991
00:45:37,625 --> 00:45:38,426
- This is bad, Dory.
- Hey, watch this!

992
00:45:38,426 --> 00:45:40,519
- This is bad, Dory.
- Hey, watch this!

993
00:45:40,562 --> 00:45:42,223
Boing! Boing!

994
00:45:42,263 --> 00:45:43,491
Dory!

995
00:45:43,531 --> 00:45:45,863
<i>You can't catch me</i>

996
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,367
Don't bounce on the tops!

997
00:45:47,402 --> 00:45:50,530
They will... not sting you!

998
00:45:50,572 --> 00:45:53,234
- The tops don't sting you!
- Two in a row! Beat that!

999
00:45:53,274 --> 00:45:56,209
Dory, listen to me.
I have an idea... a game.

1000
00:45:56,244 --> 00:45:57,711
- A game?
- Yes.

1001
00:45:57,812 --> 00:46:00,474
- I love games! Pick me!
- Here's the game.

1002
00:46:00,515 --> 00:46:03,973
Whoever can hop the fastest
out of these jellyfish wins!

1003
00:46:04,018 --> 00:46:05,645
- OK.
- Rules, rules, rules!

1004
00:46:05,687 --> 00:46:08,247
You can't touch the tentacles.
Only the tops.

1005
00:46:08,289 --> 00:46:10,154
Something about tentacles.
Got it. Go!

1006
00:46:10,191 --> 00:46:13,126
Wait! Not something about 'em,
it's all about 'em!

1007
00:46:13,161 --> 00:46:14,355
- Whee!
- Wait, Dory!

1008
00:46:14,395 --> 00:46:15,096
Gotta go faster
if you want to win!

1009
00:46:15,096 --> 00:46:16,495
Gotta go faster
if you want to win!

1010
00:46:16,531 --> 00:46:17,691
Whoa! Dory!

1011
00:46:17,732 --> 00:46:19,700
Boing, boing, boing!

1012
00:46:19,734 --> 00:46:22,601
Wait a minute! Whoa! Dory!

1013
00:46:22,637 --> 00:46:24,161
Whee!

1014
00:46:24,205 --> 00:46:27,470
We're cheating death now.
That's what we're doing.

1015
00:46:27,508 --> 00:46:29,169
But we're having fun
at the same time.

1016
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:30,643
I can do this.
Just be careful.

1017
00:46:30,678 --> 00:46:32,578
Yeah, careful I don't
make you cry when I win!

1018
00:46:32,614 --> 00:46:33,774
I don't think so!

1019
00:46:33,815 --> 00:46:35,339
Ha ha ha ha!

1020
00:46:35,383 --> 00:46:37,180
Whoa!

1021
00:46:37,218 --> 00:46:38,378
Give it up, old man.

1022
00:46:38,419 --> 00:46:40,683
You can't fight evolution.
I was built for speed.

1023
00:46:40,722 --> 00:46:42,690
The question is, Dory,
are you hungry?

1024
00:46:42,724 --> 00:46:44,055
- Hungry?
- Yeah.

1025
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:46,822
'Cause you're about
to eat my bubbles!

1026
00:46:46,861 --> 00:46:49,022
Duck to the left!
Right there!

1027
00:46:51,399 --> 00:46:53,833
The clownfish is the winner!

1028
00:46:53,868 --> 00:46:56,928
Whoo-hoo! We did it!
Look at us!

1029
00:46:56,971 --> 00:46:58,498
Dory?

1030
00:47:00,733 --> 00:47:02,132
Oh, no.

1031
00:47:03,202 --> 00:47:05,500
Dory! Dory!

1032
00:47:05,538 --> 00:47:07,631
Dory!

1033
00:47:09,609 --> 00:47:11,839
Dory!

1034
00:47:11,878 --> 00:47:13,709
Ohh!

1035
00:47:16,015 --> 00:47:18,745
Am I disqualified?

1036
00:47:18,784 --> 00:47:20,752
No, you're doing fine!
You're actually winning!

1037
00:47:20,786 --> 00:47:23,914
But you gotta stay awake.
Where does P. Sherman live?

1038
00:47:23,956 --> 00:47:26,857
P. Sherman...
Wallaby Way, Sydney...

1039
00:47:26,893 --> 00:47:28,656
That's it!

1040
00:47:28,694 --> 00:47:29,854
Uhh!

1041
00:47:29,896 --> 00:47:32,592
- Wallaby Way...
- Uhh! Stay awake!

1042
00:47:32,632 --> 00:47:34,930
Stay awake!
Ooh! Stay awake!

1043
00:47:34,967 --> 00:47:38,733
Stay... awake!

1044
00:47:41,274 --> 00:47:44,539
- Awake.
- P. Sherman.

1045
00:47:44,577 --> 00:47:47,569
- Awake.
- 42 Wallaby Way.

1046
00:47:47,613 --> 00:47:51,183
Wake up. Nemo...

1047
00:47:51,183 --> 00:47:51,581
Wake up. Nemo...

1048
00:48:06,299 --> 00:48:08,665
You miss your dad,
don't you, Sharkbait?

1049
00:48:08,701 --> 00:48:09,569
Yeah.

1050
00:48:09,569 --> 00:48:10,058
Yeah.

1051
00:48:10,102 --> 00:48:14,095
You're lucky to have someone
out there looking for you.

1052
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,301
He's not looking for me.

1053
00:48:16,342 --> 00:48:19,709
He's scared of the ocean.

1054
00:48:19,745 --> 00:48:21,303
Peach, any movement?

1055
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:24,281
He's had four cups of coffee.
It's gotta be soon.

1056
00:48:24,317 --> 00:48:25,841
Keep on him.

1057
00:48:28,254 --> 00:48:31,087
My first escape...
landed on dental tools.

1058
00:48:31,123 --> 00:48:32,556
I was aiming for the toilet.

1059
00:48:32,592 --> 00:48:33,786
Toilet?

1060
00:48:33,826 --> 00:48:36,420
All drains
lead to the ocean, kid.

1061
00:48:36,462 --> 00:48:39,727
Wow. How many times have
you tried to get out?

1062
00:48:39,765 --> 00:48:41,357
Ah, I've lost count.

1063
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,334
Fish aren't meant
to be in a box, kid.

1064
00:48:43,369 --> 00:48:45,030
It does things to you.

1065
00:48:45,071 --> 00:48:47,198
Bubbles! Bubbles!

1066
00:48:47,239 --> 00:48:49,605
Potty break! He grabbed
the "Reader's Digest."

1067
00:48:49,642 --> 00:48:53,043
- We have 4.2 minutes!
- That's your cue, Sharkbait.

1068
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:55,377
- You can do it, kid.
- We gotta be quick.

1069
00:48:55,414 --> 00:48:55,615
Once you get in, swim to
the bottom of the chamber...

1070
00:48:55,615 --> 00:48:58,049
Once you get in, swim to
the bottom of the chamber...

1071
00:48:58,084 --> 00:48:59,847
and I'll talk you
through the rest.

1072
00:48:59,885 --> 00:49:02,683
- OK.
- It'll be a piece of kelp.

1073
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:12,495
Nicely done!

1074
00:49:12,531 --> 00:49:14,260
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah!

1075
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,791
Here comes the pebble.

1076
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:19,264
Ptoo.

1077
00:49:21,741 --> 00:49:24,539
Now, do you see
a small opening?

1078
00:49:24,577 --> 00:49:26,010
Uh-huh!

1079
00:49:26,045 --> 00:49:29,208
<i>Inside it,</i>
<i>you'll see a rotating fan.</i>

1080
00:49:29,248 --> 00:49:33,776
<i>Wedge that pebble into the fan</i>
<i>to stop it turning.</i>

1081
00:49:37,189 --> 00:49:38,486
Aah!

1082
00:49:38,524 --> 00:49:40,822
- Careful, Sharkbait!
- I can't do it!

1083
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:42,384
Gill, this isn't a good idea.

1084
00:49:42,428 --> 00:49:44,191
He'll be fine. Try again!

1085
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:46,926
OK.

1086
00:49:46,966 --> 00:49:49,434
<i>That's it, Sharkbait.</i>

1087
00:49:49,468 --> 00:49:51,766
<i>Nice and steady.</i>

1088
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,798
I got it! I got it!

1089
00:49:55,841 --> 00:49:58,571
- He did it!
- That's great, kid!

1090
00:49:58,611 --> 00:50:00,806
<i>Now swim up the tube</i>
<i>and out.</i>

1091
00:50:18,097 --> 00:50:20,827
Oh, no! Gill!

1092
00:50:20,866 --> 00:50:22,060
- Sharkbait!
- Oh, my gosh!

1093
00:50:22,101 --> 00:50:23,329
Get him outta there!

1094
00:50:23,369 --> 00:50:25,894
- What do we do?
- Oh, no!

1095
00:50:25,938 --> 00:50:27,906
Stay calm, kid.
Just don't panic!

1096
00:50:28,941 --> 00:50:30,340
Help me!

1097
00:50:30,376 --> 00:50:32,742
Sharkbait, grab hold of this!

1098
00:50:36,248 --> 00:50:38,216
- No! No! No!
- Feed me more!

1099
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:41,185
- That's it!
- Sharkbait! Grab it!

1100
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,916
I got it!

1101
00:50:43,956 --> 00:50:45,753
Pull!

1102
00:50:52,431 --> 00:50:55,127
Gill, don't make him
go back in there.

1103
00:50:56,368 --> 00:51:00,395
No. We're done.

1104
00:51:13,452 --> 00:51:15,147
<i>Dude.</i>

1105
00:51:15,187 --> 00:51:18,247
- Uhh.
- Dude.

1106
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:22,784
Focus, dude. Dude.

1107
00:51:22,828 --> 00:51:24,455
Ohh.

1108
00:51:24,497 --> 00:51:26,089
Oh, he lives.
Hey, dude!

1109
00:51:26,132 --> 00:51:29,499
Ohh. What happened?

1110
00:51:29,535 --> 00:51:31,594
Saw the whole thing, dude.

1111
00:51:31,637 --> 00:51:33,502
First, you were all,
like, "Whoa!"...

1112
00:51:33,539 --> 00:51:35,166
and then we were
all, like, "Whoa!"...

1113
00:51:35,207 --> 00:51:37,107
and then you were,
like, "Whoa."

1114
00:51:37,143 --> 00:51:38,576
What are you talking about?

1115
00:51:38,611 --> 00:51:42,047
You, mini-man.
Takin' on the jellies.

1116
00:51:42,081 --> 00:51:44,914
You got serious
thrill issues, dude.

1117
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:46,212
- Ohh.
- Awesome.

1118
00:51:46,252 --> 00:51:49,449
Uhh. Oh, my stomach. Ohh!

1119
00:51:49,488 --> 00:51:51,456
Oh, man. No hurlin'
on the shell, dude, OK?

1120
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:52,684
Just waxed it.

1121
00:51:52,725 --> 00:51:54,955
So, Mr. Turtle...

1122
00:51:54,994 --> 00:51:57,360
Whoa, dude.
Mr. Turtle is my father.

1123
00:51:57,396 --> 00:51:58,829
The name's Crush.

1124
00:51:58,864 --> 00:52:01,196
Crush? Really?

1125
00:52:01,233 --> 00:52:05,897
OK, Crush. I need to
the East Australian Current.

1126
00:52:05,938 --> 00:52:07,166
E.A.C.?

1127
00:52:07,206 --> 00:52:09,140
Oh, dude.

1128
00:52:09,175 --> 00:52:11,541
You're ridin' it, dude!

1129
00:52:11,577 --> 00:52:14,205
Check it out!

1130
00:52:35,134 --> 00:52:36,999
OK, grab shell, dude!

1131
00:52:37,036 --> 00:52:38,804
Grab wh-a-a-at?!

1132
00:52:38,804 --> 00:52:39,361
Grab wh-a-a-at?!

1133
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:50,842
Ha ha! Righteous!
Righteous!

1134
00:52:50,883 --> 00:52:55,621
- Yeah!
- Stop!

1135
00:52:55,621 --> 00:52:58,089
So...

1136
00:52:58,123 --> 00:53:01,650
What brings you on this fine day
to the E.A.C.?

1137
00:53:01,694 --> 00:53:04,288
Dory and I need
to get to Sydney.

1138
00:53:04,330 --> 00:53:06,560
Dory!
Is she all right?

1139
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:08,396
Huh? Oh, little blue.

1140
00:53:09,501 --> 00:53:11,093
She is sub-level, dude.

1141
00:53:15,241 --> 00:53:17,801
Dory! Dory! Dory!

1142
00:53:17,843 --> 00:53:19,572
Dory.

1143
00:53:21,313 --> 00:53:24,146
I'm so sorry.

1144
00:53:24,183 --> 00:53:27,516
This is all my fault.
It's my fault.

1145
00:53:27,553 --> 00:53:32,524
Twenty-nine, thirty!
Ready or not, here I come!

1146
00:53:32,524 --> 00:53:34,549
There you are!

1147
00:53:35,828 --> 00:53:38,695
Catch me if you can!

1148
00:53:38,731 --> 00:53:41,097
Dory?

1149
00:53:41,133 --> 00:53:42,964
<i>Nice wave!</i>

1150
00:53:43,002 --> 00:53:45,027
Oh, wow!

1151
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:46,731
Heh heh.

1152
00:53:46,772 --> 00:53:47,206
Up you go!

1153
00:53:47,206 --> 00:53:48,605
Up you go!

1154
00:53:48,641 --> 00:53:51,633
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

1155
00:53:51,677 --> 00:53:53,110
Whoa! Whoa!

1156
00:53:54,413 --> 00:53:56,745
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!

1157
00:53:58,651 --> 00:54:01,245
- Oh, my goodness!
- Kill the motor, dude.

1158
00:54:01,287 --> 00:54:04,620
Let us see what Squirt does
flying solo.

1159
00:54:10,362 --> 00:54:13,058
Whoa!

1160
00:54:13,098 --> 00:54:16,090
Whoa! That was so cool!

1161
00:54:16,135 --> 00:54:17,932
Hey, Dad,
did you see that?

1162
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:20,302
Did you see me?
Did you see what I did?

1163
00:54:20,339 --> 00:54:23,308
You so totally rock, Squirt!

1164
00:54:23,342 --> 00:54:24,866
So give me some fin.

1165
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:26,309
Noggin.

1166
00:54:26,345 --> 00:54:27,710
- Dude.
- Dude.

1167
00:54:27,746 --> 00:54:29,145
Oh... intro.

1168
00:54:29,181 --> 00:54:31,081
Jellyman, offspring.

1169
00:54:31,116 --> 00:54:33,175
Offspring, Jellyman.

1170
00:54:33,218 --> 00:54:36,745
- Jellies?! Sweet.
- Totally.

1171
00:54:36,789 --> 00:54:40,020
Apparently, I must've done
something you liked... dudes.

1172
00:54:40,059 --> 00:54:42,493
- You rock, dude!
- Ow.

1173
00:54:42,528 --> 00:54:47,261
Curl away, my son.
It's awesome, Jellyman.

1174
00:54:47,299 --> 00:54:48,960
<i>The little dudes</i>
<i>are just eggs.</i>

1175
00:54:49,001 --> 00:54:50,764
<i>We leave 'em</i>
<i>on a beach to hatch...</i>

1176
00:54:50,803 --> 00:54:52,065
and then, coo-coo-cachoo...

1177
00:54:52,104 --> 00:54:54,504
they find their way back
to the big ol' blue.

1178
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:56,872
- All by themselves?
- Yeah.

1179
00:54:56,909 --> 00:54:59,901
But, dude, how do you know
when they're ready?

1180
00:54:59,945 --> 00:55:01,173
Well, you never really know.

1181
00:55:01,213 --> 00:55:04,614
But when they know,
you'll know, you know? Ha.

1182
00:55:08,854 --> 00:55:10,287
Hey, look, everybody.

1183
00:55:10,322 --> 00:55:13,018
I know that dude!
It's the Jellyman!

1184
00:55:13,058 --> 00:55:15,083
Go on. Jump on him!

1185
00:55:15,127 --> 00:55:18,324
- Turtle pile!
- Wait, wait, wait!

1186
00:55:18,364 --> 00:55:20,423
- Are you funny?
- Where's your shell?

1187
00:55:20,466 --> 00:55:22,525
- I need to breathe!
- Are you running away?

1188
00:55:22,568 --> 00:55:24,229
Did you really cross
the jellyfish forest?

1189
00:55:24,269 --> 00:55:26,237
- Did they sting you?
- One at a time!

1190
00:55:26,271 --> 00:55:27,932
Mr. Fish, did you die?

1191
00:55:27,973 --> 00:55:30,498
Sorry, I was
a little vague on the details.

1192
00:55:30,542 --> 00:55:31,702
So, where are you going?

1193
00:55:31,744 --> 00:55:33,609
You see, my son was taken.

1194
00:55:33,645 --> 00:55:36,478
My son was taken away from me.

1195
00:55:36,515 --> 00:55:38,779
- No way.
- What happened?

1196
00:55:38,817 --> 00:55:40,978
No, no, kids.
I don't want to talk about it.

1197
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:43,352
Aww! Please?

1198
00:55:43,389 --> 00:55:44,720
Please?

1199
00:55:44,757 --> 00:55:47,493
Well, OK.

1200
00:55:47,493 --> 00:55:51,327
I live on this reef
a long, long way from here.

1201
00:55:51,363 --> 00:55:53,388
This is gonna be good.
I can tell.

1202
00:55:53,432 --> 00:55:55,832
And my son Nemo...

1203
00:55:55,868 --> 00:55:57,836
See, he was mad at me.

1204
00:55:57,870 --> 00:55:59,497
And maybe he wouldn't
have done it...

1205
00:55:59,538 --> 00:56:01,028
if I hadn't been
so tough on him.

1206
00:56:01,073 --> 00:56:02,301
I don't know.

1207
00:56:02,341 --> 00:56:04,332
Anyway, he swam out in
the open water to this boat...

1208
00:56:04,376 --> 00:56:07,243
and when he was out there,
these divers appeared...

1209
00:56:07,279 --> 00:56:09,907
and I tried to stop them,
but the boat was too fast.

1210
00:56:09,948 --> 00:56:11,711
So, we swam out in the ocean
to follow them...

1211
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:14,082
They couldn't stop 'em.
And then Nemo's dad...

1212
00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:16,883
he swims out to the ocean,
and they bump into...

1213
00:56:16,922 --> 00:56:18,219
...three ferocious sharks.

1214
00:56:18,257 --> 00:56:20,350
He scares away the sharks
by blowing 'em up!

1215
00:56:20,392 --> 00:56:21,723
Golly, that's amazing.

1216
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,387
And then dives
thousands of feet...

1217
00:56:23,429 --> 00:56:25,158
...straight down
into the dark.

1218
00:56:25,197 --> 00:56:26,664
It's wicked dark down there.

1219
00:56:26,698 --> 00:56:28,393
You can't see a thing.
How's it going, Bob?

1220
00:56:28,434 --> 00:56:30,095
And the only thing
they can see down there...

1221
00:56:30,135 --> 00:56:31,864
...is the light from
this big, horrible creature...

1222
00:56:31,904 --> 00:56:33,872
with razor-sharp teeth.
Nice parry, old man.

1223
00:56:33,906 --> 00:56:35,271
And then he has
to blast his way...

1224
00:56:35,307 --> 00:56:36,934
So, these two little fish
have been...

1225
00:56:36,975 --> 00:56:40,512
searching the ocean for days
on the East Australian Current.

1226
00:56:40,512 --> 00:56:42,844
Which means that he may be
on his way here right now.

1227
00:56:42,881 --> 00:56:44,405
That should put him
in Sydney Harbor...

1228
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:45,747
...in a matter of days.
I mean, it sounds like...

1229
00:56:45,784 --> 00:56:47,775
this guy is gonna
stop at nothing...

1230
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:50,584
...till he finds his son.
I sure hope he makes it.

1231
00:56:50,622 --> 00:56:53,614
That's one dedicated father,
if you ask me.

1232
00:56:59,231 --> 00:57:01,165
Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1233
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:06,502
Mine! Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1234
00:57:06,538 --> 00:57:08,233
Mine! Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1235
00:57:08,273 --> 00:57:11,674
Would you just shut up?!

1236
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:13,177
You're rats with wings!

1237
00:57:13,212 --> 00:57:14,702
Bloke's been looking
for his boy Nemo.

1238
00:57:14,746 --> 00:57:17,078
- Nemo?!
- He was taken off the reef...

1239
00:57:17,116 --> 00:57:20,142
- Take it! You happy?
- Mine! Mine! Mine!

1240
00:57:20,185 --> 00:57:22,983
Hey, say that again!
Something about Nemo.

1241
00:57:23,021 --> 00:57:24,181
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1242
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:25,713
Whoooa...

1243
00:57:25,757 --> 00:57:26,917
Hyah!

1244
00:57:26,959 --> 00:57:28,517
Mine?

1245
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,790
Last I heard, he's heading
towards the harbor.

1246
00:57:30,829 --> 00:57:33,263
Ho ho! Brilliant!

1247
00:57:46,145 --> 00:57:47,646
Is he doing OK?

1248
00:57:47,646 --> 00:57:48,169
Is he doing OK?

1249
00:57:48,213 --> 00:57:51,410
Whatever you do,
Don't mention D-a-r...

1250
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:54,317
It's OK. I know who
you're talking about.

1251
00:58:02,327 --> 00:58:03,658
Gill?

1252
00:58:06,131 --> 00:58:07,860
Gill?

1253
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:10,562
Hey, Sharkbait.

1254
00:58:10,602 --> 00:58:12,832
I'm sorry I couldn't stop the...

1255
00:58:12,871 --> 00:58:15,032
<i>No, I'm the one</i>
<i>who should be sorry.</i>

1256
00:58:15,073 --> 00:58:17,701
I was so ready
to get out...

1257
00:58:17,743 --> 00:58:20,507
so ready to taste that ocean...

1258
00:58:20,546 --> 00:58:23,982
<i>I was willing to put you</i>
<i>in harm's way to get there.</i>

1259
00:58:24,016 --> 00:58:27,975
Nothing should be worth that.

1260
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:31,251
I'm sorry I couldn't get you
back to your father, kid.

1261
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,861
All right.
Hey, hey, hey...

1262
00:58:37,896 --> 00:58:39,523
- What the...
- Aaah!

1263
00:58:39,565 --> 00:58:43,296
That's one way to pull a tooth.

1264
00:58:43,335 --> 00:58:45,428
Huh. Darn kids.

1265
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:48,462
Good thing I pulled the
right one, eh, Prime Minister?

1266
00:58:48,507 --> 00:58:50,065
Hey, psst!

1267
00:58:50,108 --> 00:58:52,099
Oh, Nigel!
You just missed an extraction.

1268
00:58:52,144 --> 00:58:54,772
Has he loosened
the periodontal ligament yet?

1269
00:58:54,813 --> 00:58:56,872
What am I talking about?
Where's Nemo?

1270
00:58:56,982 --> 00:58:59,246
- I've got to speak with him.
- What is it?

1271
00:58:59,284 --> 00:59:01,377
Your dad's been fighting
the entire ocean...

1272
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:04,048
- Iooking for you.
- My father? Really?

1273
00:59:04,089 --> 00:59:08,219
He's traveled hundreds of miles,
battling sharks and jellyfish...

1274
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:10,751
Sharks? That can't be him.

1275
00:59:10,796 --> 00:59:13,390
What was his name?
Some sort of sport fish.

1276
00:59:13,432 --> 00:59:15,593
- Tuna? Trout?
- Marlin?

1277
00:59:15,634 --> 00:59:17,465
Marlin! The little clownfish
from the reef.

1278
00:59:17,502 --> 00:59:20,096
It's my dad!
He took on a shark!

1279
00:59:20,138 --> 00:59:22,470
I heard he took on three.

1280
00:59:22,507 --> 00:59:25,340
- Three sharks?
- That's 4,800 teeth!

1281
00:59:25,377 --> 00:59:27,470
After you were taken
by Diver Dan over there...

1282
00:59:27,512 --> 00:59:29,742
your dad followed the boat
like a maniac.

1283
00:59:29,781 --> 00:59:31,146
Really?

1284
00:59:31,183 --> 00:59:32,980
He's swimming,
giving it all he's got...

1285
00:59:33,018 --> 00:59:35,077
and then three gigantic
sharks capture him...

1286
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,384
and he blows them up
and dives thousands of feet...

1287
00:59:37,422 --> 00:59:40,255
and gets chased by a monster
with huge teeth!

1288
00:59:40,292 --> 00:59:42,920
He ties this demon to a rock,
and what's his reward?

1289
00:59:42,961 --> 00:59:45,327
He gets to battle
an entire jellyfish forest!

1290
00:59:45,364 --> 00:59:48,561
Now he's with a bunch of
sea turtles on the E.A. C...

1291
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:52,092
and the word is he's headed
this way right now... to Sydney!

1292
00:59:52,137 --> 00:59:53,502
- Wow!
- What a good daddy!

1293
00:59:53,538 --> 00:59:56,098
He was looking for you
after all, Sharkbait.

1294
00:59:59,611 --> 01:00:01,238
<i>He's swimming to the filter!</i>

1295
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,770
- Sharkbait!
- Not again!

1296
01:00:04,316 --> 01:00:07,251
Sharkbait!

1297
01:00:07,286 --> 01:00:08,651
No!

1298
01:00:08,687 --> 01:00:09,881
You got your whole life
ahead of you!

1299
01:00:09,921 --> 01:00:12,321
- We'll help you, kid!
- Get him out!

1300
01:00:16,628 --> 01:00:18,289
Get him out of there!

1301
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:19,957
Come on, kid!
Grab the end!

1302
01:00:19,998 --> 01:00:22,592
Sharkbait!

1303
01:00:22,634 --> 01:00:24,659
- No!
- Can you hear me?

1304
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:26,193
Nemo! Can you hear me?

1305
01:00:26,238 --> 01:00:28,263
Yeah, I can hear you.

1306
01:00:28,307 --> 01:00:30,241
Sharkbait, you did it!

1307
01:00:30,275 --> 01:00:34,075
Sharkbait, you're...
covered with germs! Aah!

1308
01:00:34,112 --> 01:00:36,181
Ha ha!
That took guts, kid.

1309
01:00:36,181 --> 01:00:38,672
All right, gang,
we have less than 48 hours...

1310
01:00:38,717 --> 01:00:40,014
before Darla gets here.

1311
01:00:40,052 --> 01:00:41,747
This tank'll get
plenty dirty in that time...

1312
01:00:41,787 --> 01:00:44,620
but we have to help it along
any way we can.

1313
01:00:44,656 --> 01:00:46,920
- Jacques? No cleaning.
- I shall resist.

1314
01:00:46,958 --> 01:00:49,620
<i>Everybody else,</i>
<i>be as gross as possible.</i>

1315
01:00:49,661 --> 01:00:50,889
<i>Think dirty thoughts.</i>

1316
01:00:50,929 --> 01:00:53,124
<i>We're gonna make</i>
<i>this tank so filthy...</i>

1317
01:00:53,165 --> 01:00:55,690
<i>the dentist</i>
<i>will have to clean it.</i>

1318
01:00:55,734 --> 01:00:57,827
- Good work!
- Ha ha ha!

1319
01:01:04,376 --> 01:01:06,901
All right, we're here, dudes!

1320
01:01:06,945 --> 01:01:10,142
Get ready!
Your exit's coming up, man!

1321
01:01:10,182 --> 01:01:11,672
Where? I don't see it!

1322
01:01:11,717 --> 01:01:14,151
Right there!
I see it! I see it!

1323
01:01:14,186 --> 01:01:17,314
The swirling vortex of terror?

1324
01:01:17,356 --> 01:01:19,654
- That's it, dude.
- Of course it is.

1325
01:01:19,691 --> 01:01:23,718
OK, first,
find your exit buddy.

1326
01:01:23,762 --> 01:01:26,253
Do you have your exit buddy?

1327
01:01:26,298 --> 01:01:27,526
Yes!

1328
01:01:27,566 --> 01:01:32,299
Squirt give you a rundown
of proper exiting technique.

1329
01:01:32,337 --> 01:01:35,864
Good afternoon!
We'll have a great jump today!

1330
01:01:35,907 --> 01:01:39,604
OK, crank a hard cutback
as you hit the wall.

1331
01:01:39,644 --> 01:01:42,579
There's a screaming bottom turn,
so watch out!

1332
01:01:42,614 --> 01:01:45,879
Remember...
rip it, roll it, and punch it!

1333
01:01:45,917 --> 01:01:49,045
He's trying to speak to me,
I know it!

1334
01:01:49,087 --> 01:01:52,318
You're really cute, but I don't
know what you're saying!

1335
01:01:52,357 --> 01:01:53,619
Say the first thing again.

1336
01:01:53,658 --> 01:01:56,183
OK, Jellyman! Go, go, go!

1337
01:02:01,433 --> 01:02:04,960
- Whoa!
- Wahoo!

1338
01:02:05,003 --> 01:02:07,062
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1339
01:02:09,107 --> 01:02:10,506
Whoo!

1340
01:02:10,542 --> 01:02:13,136
That was... fun!

1341
01:02:13,178 --> 01:02:15,442
I actually enjoyed that.

1342
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,107
Hey, look, turtles!

1343
01:02:17,149 --> 01:02:20,084
Ha ha!
Most excellent!

1344
01:02:20,118 --> 01:02:21,881
Now turn your
fishy tails around...

1345
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,117
and swim straight on
through to Sydney!

1346
01:02:25,157 --> 01:02:27,318
No worries, man!

1347
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:29,418
No worries!
Thank you, dude Crush!

1348
01:02:29,461 --> 01:02:32,021
- Bye!
- Bye, Jellyman!

1349
01:02:32,063 --> 01:02:34,361
You tell your little dude
I said hi, OK?

1350
01:02:34,399 --> 01:02:35,559
See ya later, dudes!

1351
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,329
<i>Bye, everyone!</i>

1352
01:02:37,369 --> 01:02:39,701
Nemo would have loved this.

1353
01:02:39,738 --> 01:02:43,071
Ooh! Hey! Crush, I forgot!

1354
01:02:43,108 --> 01:02:44,666
How old are you?

1355
01:02:44,709 --> 01:02:48,907
<i>150, dude!</i>
<i>And still young! Rock on!</i>

1356
01:02:48,947 --> 01:02:52,974
150! 150!
I gotta remember that.

1357
01:02:53,018 --> 01:02:54,212
Whoa.

1358
01:02:59,024 --> 01:03:01,652
- We going in there?
- Yep.

1359
01:03:01,693 --> 01:03:03,752
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

1360
01:03:03,795 --> 01:03:09,427
Yep. We're gonna
just swim straight.

1361
01:03:09,468 --> 01:03:12,232
<i>Just keep swimming,</i>
<i>just keep swimming</i>

1362
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:13,430
Dory...

1363
01:03:22,214 --> 01:03:24,842
Boy, this is taking awhile.

1364
01:03:24,883 --> 01:03:26,578
How about we play a game?

1365
01:03:26,618 --> 01:03:27,880
OK.

1366
01:03:27,919 --> 01:03:30,979
OK, I'm thinking
of something orange...

1367
01:03:31,022 --> 01:03:32,512
and it's small...

1368
01:03:32,557 --> 01:03:34,855
- It's me.
- Right!

1369
01:03:34,893 --> 01:03:38,454
It's orange and small...

1370
01:03:38,497 --> 01:03:39,794
It's me.

1371
01:03:39,831 --> 01:03:41,731
All righty,
Mr. Smartypants.

1372
01:03:41,766 --> 01:03:42,634
And it's orange and small
and white stripes...

1373
01:03:42,634 --> 01:03:44,932
And it's orange and small
and white stripes...

1374
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:47,200
Me. And the next one,
just a guess, me.

1375
01:03:47,239 --> 01:03:49,764
- That's just scary.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1376
01:03:49,808 --> 01:03:51,639
I have definitely seen
this floating speck before.

1377
01:03:51,676 --> 01:03:53,200
That means
we've passed it before...

1378
01:03:53,245 --> 01:03:54,610
and that means
we're going in circles...

1379
01:03:54,646 --> 01:03:56,204
and that means
we're not going straight!

1380
01:03:56,314 --> 01:03:58,407
- Hey, hey!
- Get to the surface.

1381
01:03:58,450 --> 01:04:00,042
We'll figure it out
up there. Let's go!

1382
01:04:00,085 --> 01:04:02,280
- Hey! Relax.
- What?

1383
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,914
Take a deep breath.

1384
01:04:06,858 --> 01:04:07,359
Now, let's ask somebody
for directions.

1385
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:09,156
Now, let's ask somebody
for directions.

1386
01:04:09,194 --> 01:04:11,219
Fine. Who do you
want to ask, the speck?

1387
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:13,629
- There's nobody here!
- There has to be someone.

1388
01:04:13,665 --> 01:04:16,532
It's the ocean, silly.
We're not the only two in here.

1389
01:04:16,568 --> 01:04:18,900
Let's see.
OK, no one there.

1390
01:04:18,937 --> 01:04:23,397
Nope. Nada.

1391
01:04:24,809 --> 01:04:26,606
There's somebody.
Hey! Excuse...

1392
01:04:26,645 --> 01:04:28,476
Dory, Dory, Dory!
Now it's my turn.

1393
01:04:28,513 --> 01:04:30,105
I'm thinking of something
dark and mysterious.

1394
01:04:30,148 --> 01:04:32,514
It's a fish we don't know.
If we ask it directions...

1395
01:04:32,551 --> 01:04:34,576
it could ingest us
and spit out our bones!

1396
01:04:34,619 --> 01:04:37,087
What is it with men
and asking for directions?

1397
01:04:37,122 --> 01:04:38,919
I don't want to play
the gender card right now.

1398
01:04:38,957 --> 01:04:40,891
Let's play
the "Let's Not Die" card.

1399
01:04:40,926 --> 01:04:42,826
- You want to get out of here?
- Of course I do.

1400
01:04:42,861 --> 01:04:46,126
How are we gonna do that
unless we give it a shot?

1401
01:04:46,164 --> 01:04:48,155
Dory, you don't
fully understand...

1402
01:04:48,199 --> 01:04:50,190
Come on. Trust me on this.

1403
01:04:58,276 --> 01:05:02,113
All right.

1404
01:05:02,113 --> 01:05:05,378
Excuse me! Whoo-hoo!
Little fella?

1405
01:05:05,417 --> 01:05:08,253
Hello!
Don't be rude. Say hi.

1406
01:05:08,253 --> 01:05:09,345
Hello!
Don't be rude. Say hi.

1407
01:05:09,387 --> 01:05:11,412
Ha. Hello.

1408
01:05:11,456 --> 01:05:12,980
- His son Bingo...
- Nemo.

1409
01:05:13,024 --> 01:05:16,050
- Nemo was taken to...
- Sydney.

1410
01:05:16,094 --> 01:05:19,291
Sydney! And it's
really, really important...

1411
01:05:19,331 --> 01:05:21,265
that we get there
as fast as we can...

1412
01:05:21,299 --> 01:05:23,392
so can you help us out?

1413
01:05:23,435 --> 01:05:26,962
Come on, little fella.
Come on.

1414
01:05:27,005 --> 01:05:30,236
Dory, I'm a little fella.

1415
01:05:30,275 --> 01:05:33,778
I don't think
that's a little fella.

1416
01:05:33,778 --> 01:05:37,680
<i>Oh! Big fella.</i>
<i>Whale. OK.</i>

1417
01:05:37,716 --> 01:05:40,184
Maybe he only speaks whale.

1418
01:05:40,218 --> 01:05:43,449
Mooo! Weee neeed...

1419
01:05:43,488 --> 01:05:47,584
- Dory?
- Tooo fiind his son.

1420
01:05:47,626 --> 01:05:50,288
What are you doing?
Are you sure you speak whale?

1421
01:05:50,328 --> 01:05:51,596
Can youuuu give us
diiirectionsss?

1422
01:05:51,596 --> 01:05:53,723
Can youuuu give us
diiirectionsss?

1423
01:05:53,765 --> 01:05:56,097
Dory! Heaven knows
what you're saying!

1424
01:05:56,134 --> 01:05:59,729
- See, he's swimming away.
- Cooome baaack.

1425
01:05:59,771 --> 01:06:02,035
He's not coming back.
You offended him.

1426
01:06:02,073 --> 01:06:03,267
- Maybe a different dialect.

1427
01:06:03,308 --> 01:06:06,505
- Moooohhhmmooo...
- Dory!

1428
01:06:06,544 --> 01:06:09,809
This is not whale.
You're speaking upset stomach.

1429
01:06:09,848 --> 01:06:10,148
- Maybe I should try humpback.
- Don't.

1430
01:06:10,148 --> 01:06:12,048
- Maybe I should try humpback.
- Don't.

1431
01:06:12,083 --> 01:06:13,550
Wooooooo...

1432
01:06:13,585 --> 01:06:16,554
- You actually sound sick.
- Maybe louder?

1433
01:06:16,588 --> 01:06:18,055
- Rah! Rah!
- Don't do that!

1434
01:06:18,089 --> 01:06:19,818
Too much orca.
Didn't it sound orca-ish?

1435
01:06:19,858 --> 01:06:21,189
It doesn't sound orca.

1436
01:06:21,226 --> 01:06:23,023
It sounds like nothing
I've ever heard.

1437
01:06:23,061 --> 01:06:25,552
- Oooooo!
- Ohh!

1438
01:06:25,597 --> 01:06:26,164
It's just as well.
He might be hungry.

1439
01:06:26,164 --> 01:06:27,529
It's just as well.
He might be hungry.

1440
01:06:27,565 --> 01:06:30,557
Whales don't eat clownfish.
They eat krill.

1441
01:06:30,602 --> 01:06:34,129
- Swim away!
- Oh, look, krill!

1442
01:06:35,540 --> 01:06:38,510
Move, Dory, move!

1443
01:06:38,510 --> 01:06:39,067
Move, Dory, move!

1444
01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:41,169
- Aah!
- Aah!

1445
01:06:45,116 --> 01:06:47,880
Look at that.
Would you look at that?

1446
01:06:47,919 --> 01:06:51,878
Filthy. Absolutely filthy.

1447
01:06:51,923 --> 01:06:54,915
All thanks to you, kid.
You made it possible.

1448
01:06:54,959 --> 01:06:56,984
Jacques,
I said no cleaning.

1449
01:06:57,095 --> 01:06:58,858
I am ashamed.

1450
01:06:58,897 --> 01:07:01,365
Look! Scum angel!

1451
01:07:03,601 --> 01:07:05,535
Ooh! Aaah!

1452
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:07,504
Bubbles!
I love the bubbles!

1453
01:07:09,574 --> 01:07:13,203
Flo? Has anybody seen Flo?

1454
01:07:13,244 --> 01:07:15,872
9:00 and cue dentist.

1455
01:07:15,914 --> 01:07:18,178
Hello, Barbara.
Sorry I'm late.

1456
01:07:18,216 --> 01:07:20,912
OK, here we go.
Here we go, OK.

1457
01:07:20,952 --> 01:07:22,681
Little Davey Reynolds...

1458
01:07:22,721 --> 01:07:24,313
<i>Walks to the counter,</i>
<i>drops the keys...</i>

1459
01:07:24,355 --> 01:07:26,448
Bloat, that's disgusting!

1460
01:07:26,491 --> 01:07:28,516
Tastes pretty good to me.

1461
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,323
- Urrrp!
- Eww!

1462
01:07:30,361 --> 01:07:33,228
Don't you people realize
we are swimming in our own...

1463
01:07:33,264 --> 01:07:34,356
Shh! Here he comes!

1464
01:07:34,399 --> 01:07:36,367
Aah!

1465
01:07:36,401 --> 01:07:39,700
Crikey. What a state.

1466
01:07:41,172 --> 01:07:45,302
Ohh. Barbara, what's my earliest
appointment tomorrow?

1467
01:07:45,343 --> 01:07:48,278
- 10:00, luv.
- Leave it open, would you?

1468
01:07:48,313 --> 01:07:50,645
<i>I've gotta clean the fish tank</i>
<i>before Darla gets here.</i>

1469
01:07:50,682 --> 01:07:52,775
Did you hear that, Sharkbait?

1470
01:07:52,817 --> 01:07:56,514
<i>Yay!</i>
<i>He's gonna clean the tank!</i>

1471
01:07:56,554 --> 01:07:58,317
We're gonna be clean!

1472
01:07:58,356 --> 01:08:00,017
You ready to see your dad, kid?

1473
01:08:00,058 --> 01:08:01,992
- Uh-huh.
- Of course you are.

1474
01:08:02,026 --> 01:08:04,654
I wouldn't be surprised
if he's out there...

1475
01:08:04,696 --> 01:08:05,263
in the harbor
waiting for you right now.

1476
01:08:05,263 --> 01:08:07,925
in the harbor
waiting for you right now.

1477
01:08:07,966 --> 01:08:10,332
Yeah.

1478
01:09:10,388 --> 01:09:13,516
Aaah!

1479
01:09:13,558 --> 01:09:16,391
Oof!

1480
01:09:21,566 --> 01:09:23,056
Whoo!

1481
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:25,295
Yaahhh!

1482
01:09:25,336 --> 01:09:27,065
Here comes the big one.

1483
01:09:27,104 --> 01:09:29,629
Ooh! Come on!
You gotta try this!

1484
01:09:29,674 --> 01:09:32,939
- Will you just stop it?
- Why? What's wrong?

1485
01:09:32,977 --> 01:09:35,275
We're in a whale,
don't you get it?

1486
01:09:35,313 --> 01:09:36,473
- Whale?
- A whale!

1487
01:09:36,514 --> 01:09:39,244
You had to ask for help!
And now we're stuck here!

1488
01:09:39,283 --> 01:09:42,047
Wow, a whale.
I speak whale.

1489
01:09:42,086 --> 01:09:44,418
No, you're insane!
You can't speak whale!

1490
01:09:44,455 --> 01:09:47,652
I have to get out!
I have to find my son!

1491
01:09:47,692 --> 01:09:53,096
I have to tell him
how old sea turtles are!

1492
01:09:55,466 --> 01:09:58,299
Ohhh!

1493
01:09:59,704 --> 01:10:02,332
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1494
01:10:04,108 --> 01:10:06,941
Hey...

1495
01:10:06,978 --> 01:10:09,242
you OK?

1496
01:10:15,319 --> 01:10:18,311
There, there.
It's all right.

1497
01:10:18,356 --> 01:10:20,290
It'll be OK.

1498
01:10:20,324 --> 01:10:22,554
No. No, it won't.

1499
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:24,823
Sure it will. You'll see.

1500
01:10:24,862 --> 01:10:30,994
No. I promised him I'd never
let anything happen to him.

1501
01:10:31,035 --> 01:10:34,436
Huh. That's a funny thing
to promise.

1502
01:10:34,472 --> 01:10:35,837
What?

1503
01:10:35,873 --> 01:10:38,307
You can't never let
anything happen to him.

1504
01:10:38,342 --> 01:10:40,776
Then nothing
would ever happen to him.

1505
01:10:43,814 --> 01:10:46,578
Not much fun for little Harpo.

1506
01:10:55,426 --> 01:10:57,257
- Hmm.
- What's going on?

1507
01:10:57,295 --> 01:10:59,593
Don't know. I'll ask him.

1508
01:11:02,133 --> 01:11:08,163
- Dory...
- Whaaat's goooing onnn?

1509
01:11:14,211 --> 01:11:15,803
I think he says we've stopped.

1510
01:11:15,846 --> 01:11:19,111
Of course we've stopped.
Stop trying to speak whale.

1511
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:21,948
You'll make things worse.
What is that noise?

1512
01:11:26,057 --> 01:11:28,855
Oh, no. Look what you did.

1513
01:11:28,893 --> 01:11:33,853
The water's going down.
It's going down!

1514
01:11:37,568 --> 01:11:39,001
Really? You sure about that?

1515
01:11:39,036 --> 01:11:41,095
Look!
Already it's half empty!

1516
01:11:41,138 --> 01:11:42,901
I'd say it's half full.

1517
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:44,407
Stop that! It's half empty!

1518
01:11:47,478 --> 01:11:50,675
OK, that one
was a little tougher.

1519
01:11:50,715 --> 01:11:53,284
He either said we should go
to the back of the throat...

1520
01:11:53,284 --> 01:11:53,613
He either said we should go
to the back of the throat...

1521
01:11:53,651 --> 01:11:55,812
or he wants a root beer float.

1522
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:57,480
Of course he wants us
to go there!

1523
01:11:57,521 --> 01:11:59,455
That's eating us!

1524
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:02,459
How do I taste, Moby?
Do I taste good?

1525
01:12:02,493 --> 01:12:04,757
Tell him I'm not interested
in being lunch!

1526
01:12:04,795 --> 01:12:07,263
- OK. Heee...
- Stop talking to him!

1527
01:12:10,568 --> 01:12:13,401
- Aah!
- Aah!

1528
01:12:13,437 --> 01:12:14,597
What is going on?

1529
01:12:14,639 --> 01:12:16,937
I'll check. Whaaat...

1530
01:12:16,974 --> 01:12:19,738
No more whale!
You can't speak whale!

1531
01:12:19,777 --> 01:12:22,109
- Yes, I can!
- No, you can't!

1532
01:12:22,146 --> 01:12:25,707
You think you can do these
things, but you can't, Nemo!

1533
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:33,554
- OK.
- Dory! Oof!

1534
01:12:36,127 --> 01:12:39,722
He says it's time to let go.

1535
01:12:39,764 --> 01:12:41,732
Everything's gonna be
all right.

1536
01:12:41,766 --> 01:12:43,427
How do you know?

1537
01:12:43,467 --> 01:12:46,561
How do you know something bad
isn't gonna happen?

1538
01:12:46,604 --> 01:12:48,504
I don't!

1539
01:13:00,718 --> 01:13:04,021
- Aah!
- Aah!

1540
01:13:04,021 --> 01:13:04,919
- Aah!
- Aah!

1541
01:13:04,955 --> 01:13:06,718
- Aah!
- Aah!

1542
01:13:09,126 --> 01:13:13,893
Ha ha ha!
We're alive!

1543
01:13:14,965 --> 01:13:17,832
Look! Sy-d-ney... Sydney!

1544
01:13:17,868 --> 01:13:20,302
Sydney! Sydney again!

1545
01:13:22,306 --> 01:13:24,774
You were right, Dory!
We made it!

1546
01:13:24,809 --> 01:13:27,744
We're gonna find my son!

1547
01:13:30,314 --> 01:13:30,748
Thaaank yoouuu, sirrr!

1548
01:13:30,748 --> 01:13:33,808
Thaaank yoouuu, sirrr!

1549
01:13:33,851 --> 01:13:36,319
Wow. I wish
I could speak whale.

1550
01:13:36,353 --> 01:13:38,651
All we gotta do is find
the boat that took him.

1551
01:13:38,689 --> 01:13:41,783
- Right!
- We can do this!

1552
01:13:55,406 --> 01:13:57,704
Morning.

1553
01:13:57,742 --> 01:14:01,007
It's morning, everyone!
Today's the day!

1554
01:14:01,045 --> 01:14:03,206
The sun is shining,
the tank is clean...

1555
01:14:03,247 --> 01:14:06,307
and we are getting out...
The tank is clean.

1556
01:14:06,350 --> 01:14:08,910
The tank is clean!

1557
01:14:08,953 --> 01:14:10,545
<i>But how?</i>

1558
01:14:10,588 --> 01:14:13,284
Boss must've installed it
while we were sleeping.

1559
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:16,782
- What are we gonna do?
- What's it say, Peach?

1560
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:19,493
I can't hear you, Peach.

1561
01:14:19,530 --> 01:14:21,964
The Aquascum 2003 is
an all-purpose, self-cleaning...

1562
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:23,967
maintenance-free,
salt water purifier...

1563
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:26,993
that is guaranteed to extend
the life of your aquarium fish.

1564
01:14:27,037 --> 01:14:28,265
Stop it!

1565
01:14:28,305 --> 01:14:29,795
The Aquascum
is programmed to scan...

1566
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,138
your tank environment
every five minutes?!

1567
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,871
Scan? What does that mean?

1568
01:14:35,513 --> 01:14:37,344
Aah!

1569
01:14:38,749 --> 01:14:39,150
<i>Temperature... 82 degrees...</i>

1570
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:40,310
<i>Temperature... 82 degrees...</i>

1571
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:42,012
<i>PH balance... normal.</i>

1572
01:14:42,052 --> 01:14:44,452
- Ooh.
- Nice.

1573
01:14:44,488 --> 01:14:49,050
Ooh... Oh!
Curse you, Aquascum!

1574
01:14:49,093 --> 01:14:51,186
That's it for the escape plan.
It's ruined.

1575
01:14:51,228 --> 01:14:52,661
Then what are
we gonna do about...

1576
01:14:52,696 --> 01:14:53,164
Darla!

1577
01:14:53,164 --> 01:14:54,688
Darla!

1578
01:14:54,732 --> 01:14:57,326
Stay down, kid!

1579
01:14:57,368 --> 01:14:59,336
<i>- False alarm.</i>
<i>- Whew.</i>

1580
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:01,463
My nerves can't take
much more of this.

1581
01:15:01,505 --> 01:15:03,735
<i>What'll we do</i>
<i>when that brat gets here?</i>

1582
01:15:03,774 --> 01:15:06,004
<i>- I'm thinking.</i>
<i>- Oh! Gill!</i>

1583
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:09,206
- Nemo! I'm coming!
- Help me! Help me!

1584
01:15:09,246 --> 01:15:13,148
Swim down! Come on, kid!

1585
01:15:13,184 --> 01:15:14,674
- Everybody jump in!
- Swim down!

1586
01:15:14,718 --> 01:15:16,015
- That's it!
- What the...?

1587
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:19,318
- Yay!
- Ha ha! Good work!

1588
01:15:19,356 --> 01:15:20,880
Gill!

1589
01:15:20,925 --> 01:15:22,517
- Nemo!
- Sharkbait!

1590
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:25,961
- Roll, kid!
- Lean! Lean!

1591
01:15:30,434 --> 01:15:32,868
Whoops.
That would've been a nasty fall.

1592
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:35,497
Gill!
Don't let me go belly-up!

1593
01:15:35,539 --> 01:15:37,837
Just calm down, Nemo.
You won't go belly-up.

1594
01:15:37,875 --> 01:15:40,275
I promise.
You're gonna be OK.

1595
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:45,272
Darla!

1596
01:15:48,752 --> 01:15:52,483
Do any of these boats
look familiar to you?

1597
01:15:52,523 --> 01:15:54,423
No, but the boat
has to be here somewhere.

1598
01:15:54,458 --> 01:15:56,585
Come on, Dory.
We're gonna find it.

1599
01:15:56,627 --> 01:15:59,357
I'm totally excited.
Are you excited?

1600
01:15:59,396 --> 01:16:01,159
Dory, wake up.
Wake up, come on.

1601
01:16:01,198 --> 01:16:03,029
Duck!

1602
01:16:03,067 --> 01:16:06,468
That's not a duck.
It's a... pelican!

1603
01:16:06,503 --> 01:16:07,936
- Whoa!
- Aah!

1604
01:16:14,612 --> 01:16:15,772
- Whoa!
- Aah!

1605
01:16:15,813 --> 01:16:19,078
No! I didn't come this far
to be breakfast!

1606
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:29,058
Hey, Nigel.
Would you look at that?

1607
01:16:29,093 --> 01:16:30,458
What? What?

1608
01:16:30,494 --> 01:16:33,361
Sun's barely up and Gerald's
had more than he can handle.

1609
01:16:33,397 --> 01:16:36,025
Yeah. Reckon somebody
ought to help the poor guy.

1610
01:16:36,066 --> 01:16:38,057
Yeah, right. Yeah.

1611
01:16:38,102 --> 01:16:41,731
Don't everybody
fly off at once.

1612
01:16:44,842 --> 01:16:47,777
All right, Gerald.
Fish got your tongue?

1613
01:16:47,811 --> 01:16:50,414
- Aah!
- Love a duck!

1614
01:16:50,414 --> 01:16:50,778
- Aah!
- Love a duck!

1615
01:16:50,814 --> 01:16:52,509
I gotta find my son Nemo!

1616
01:16:52,549 --> 01:16:55,643
Nemo? He's that fish!

1617
01:16:55,686 --> 01:16:58,246
The one that's been fighting
the whole ocean!

1618
01:16:58,289 --> 01:17:00,757
I know where your son... Huh?

1619
01:17:02,393 --> 01:17:04,088
Wait! Come back! Stop!

1620
01:17:04,128 --> 01:17:06,358
Dory, keep going!
He's crazy!

1621
01:17:06,397 --> 01:17:08,160
I got something to tell you!

1622
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:13,993
Mine.

1623
01:17:18,075 --> 01:17:21,602
Don't make any sudden moves.

1624
01:17:21,645 --> 01:17:25,911
Hop inside my mouth
if you want to live.

1625
01:17:25,950 --> 01:17:29,579
Hop in your mouth?
How does that make me live?

1626
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:30,780
Mine?

1627
01:17:30,821 --> 01:17:31,155
Because
I can take you to your son.

1628
01:17:31,155 --> 01:17:34,454
Because
I can take you to your son.

1629
01:17:34,491 --> 01:17:37,153
- Yeah, right.
- No. I know your son.

1630
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:39,890
He's orange with
a gimpy fin on one side.

1631
01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:41,090
- That's Nemo!
- Aah!

1632
01:17:41,131 --> 01:17:43,793
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1633
01:17:43,834 --> 01:17:45,301
Aah!

1634
01:17:45,336 --> 01:17:47,827
Fasten your seat belts!

1635
01:17:48,973 --> 01:17:51,100
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1636
01:17:51,175 --> 01:17:53,200
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1637
01:17:53,243 --> 01:17:55,370
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

1638
01:17:55,412 --> 01:17:59,007
Ha ha ha ha!

1639
01:18:00,451 --> 01:18:02,146
Aah!

1640
01:18:09,526 --> 01:18:11,721
Everybody hold on!

1641
01:18:11,762 --> 01:18:13,525
- Aah!
- Aah!

1642
01:18:15,099 --> 01:18:17,590
Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

1643
01:18:23,707 --> 01:18:26,335
Too loud!
Too loud for me!

1644
01:18:26,377 --> 01:18:28,607
<i>Twinkle, twinkle,</i>
<i>little star</i>

1645
01:18:28,645 --> 01:18:31,512
Find a happy place!
Find a happy place!

1646
01:18:31,548 --> 01:18:34,073
Darla, your uncle
will see you now.

1647
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:38,645
All right, let's see
those pearly whites.

1648
01:18:38,689 --> 01:18:42,989
Raah! I'm a piranha.
They're in the Amazon.

1649
01:18:43,027 --> 01:18:46,463
And a piranha's a fish,
just like your present.

1650
01:18:47,831 --> 01:18:49,594
<i>I get fishy, fishy</i>

1651
01:18:49,633 --> 01:18:52,727
Oh, no.
Poor little guy.

1652
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:54,601
- He's dead.
- Sharkbait!

1653
01:18:54,638 --> 01:18:55,832
Yay! Fishy, fishy, fishy!

1654
01:18:55,873 --> 01:18:57,465
Must've left your present
in the car, sweetie.

1655
01:18:57,508 --> 01:18:59,806
<i>- Ohh!</i>
<i>- I'll go and get it.</i>

1656
01:18:59,843 --> 01:19:01,572
- He's still alive!
- He's not dead!

1657
01:19:01,612 --> 01:19:03,637
What's happening?
Why is he playing dead?

1658
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:05,545
<i>He's gonna get flushed</i>
<i>down the toilet.</i>

1659
01:19:05,582 --> 01:19:07,982
<i>- He's gonna get out of here!</i>
<i>- He's gonna get flushed!</i>

1660
01:19:08,018 --> 01:19:09,781
<i>What a smart little guy!</i>

1661
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:11,378
<i>Oh, no!</i>
<i>Not the trash can!</i>

1662
01:19:11,422 --> 01:19:12,719
Nemo! No!

1663
01:19:12,756 --> 01:19:16,157
- Hey! I found his dad!
- Where's Nemo?

1664
01:19:16,193 --> 01:19:17,558
- Dentist!
- He's over there!

1665
01:19:17,594 --> 01:19:20,995
What's a dentist?
Nigel, get in there!

1666
01:19:21,031 --> 01:19:24,990
- I can't go in there!
- Yes, you can! Charge!

1667
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:27,994
- Aah!
- What the...?

1668
01:19:29,273 --> 01:19:31,867
Darla, sweetie, look out!

1669
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:37,440
<i>- Aah!</i>
<i>- Hold still!</i>

1670
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:39,415
<i>- Aah!</i>
<i>- Easy! Easy!</i>

1671
01:19:40,717 --> 01:19:41,945
- Aah!
- Hold still!

1672
01:19:41,985 --> 01:19:45,148
Nobody's going to hurt you!
Oof!

1673
01:19:51,228 --> 01:19:53,628
Nemo.

1674
01:19:53,664 --> 01:19:54,926
Oh, my goodness.

1675
01:19:54,965 --> 01:19:56,865
Gotcha! Keep down!

1676
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:58,162
Nemo!

1677
01:19:58,202 --> 01:19:59,931
Daddy?

1678
01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:03,804
Out with you!
And stay out!

1679
01:20:03,841 --> 01:20:05,172
Daddy?

1680
01:20:05,209 --> 01:20:06,608
Fishy?

1681
01:20:06,643 --> 01:20:09,771
Fishy! Wake up!

1682
01:20:09,813 --> 01:20:10,973
Oh, no!

1683
01:20:11,014 --> 01:20:13,539
To the top of
Mount Wannahockaloogie!

1684
01:20:13,584 --> 01:20:15,984
Why are you sleeping?

1685
01:20:16,019 --> 01:20:18,453
- Hurry!
- Bloat!

1686
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:23,618
Ring of Fire!

1687
01:20:24,628 --> 01:20:28,189
Fishy! Aah!

1688
01:20:29,666 --> 01:20:31,725
Crikey! All the animals
have gone mad!

1689
01:20:31,768 --> 01:20:33,497
Unh!

1690
01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:36,097
<i>Aaah! Get it out!</i>

1691
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:38,700
- Smack her in the head!
- Go, Gill, go!

1692
01:20:38,742 --> 01:20:40,733
Fish in my hair!

1693
01:20:40,777 --> 01:20:42,142
Gill!

1694
01:20:42,179 --> 01:20:46,673
Sharkbait...
tell your dad I said hi.

1695
01:20:46,717 --> 01:20:48,207
- Unh!
- Eww!

1696
01:20:51,722 --> 01:20:52,984
Go get 'em!

1697
01:20:53,023 --> 01:20:55,389
Ohh...

1698
01:20:57,995 --> 01:20:59,724
- He did it!
- Yay!

1699
01:20:59,763 --> 01:21:02,698
- I'm so happy!
- Is he gonna be OK, Gill?

1700
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:04,963
Don't worry.
All drains lead to the ocean.

1701
01:21:05,002 --> 01:21:06,731
Fishy!

1702
01:21:08,338 --> 01:21:11,603
Aah!

1703
01:21:11,642 --> 01:21:14,236
Aah! Whoa! Whoa!

1704
01:21:14,278 --> 01:21:16,610
Daddy!

1705
01:21:52,416 --> 01:21:55,249
I'm so sorry.

1706
01:21:56,420 --> 01:21:57,888
<i>Truly, I am.</i>

1707
01:21:57,888 --> 01:21:58,718
<i>Truly, I am.</i>

1708
01:22:16,073 --> 01:22:18,268
- Hey.
- Dory...

1709
01:22:18,308 --> 01:22:20,367
if it wasn't for you...

1710
01:22:20,410 --> 01:22:23,208
I never would've even
made it here.

1711
01:22:23,247 --> 01:22:25,238
So, thank you.

1712
01:22:27,351 --> 01:22:29,080
Hey, wait a minute.

1713
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:31,679
Wait. Where are you going?

1714
01:22:31,722 --> 01:22:35,283
It's over, Dory.
We were too late.

1715
01:22:35,325 --> 01:22:40,092
Nemo's gone,
and I'm going home now.

1716
01:22:40,130 --> 01:22:42,621
No. No, you can't.

1717
01:22:44,468 --> 01:22:46,231
Stop!

1718
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:49,601
Please don't go away.

1719
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:51,574
Please?

1720
01:22:51,608 --> 01:22:54,372
No one's ever stuck with me
for so long before.

1721
01:22:54,411 --> 01:22:57,972
And if you leave, I just...

1722
01:22:58,015 --> 01:22:59,949
I remember things
better with you.

1723
01:22:59,983 --> 01:23:02,975
I do. Look...
P. Sherman, 42...

1724
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:05,955
42...

1725
01:23:05,989 --> 01:23:08,753
I remember it.
I do. It's there.

1726
01:23:08,792 --> 01:23:10,885
I know it is because
when I look at you...

1727
01:23:10,927 --> 01:23:12,360
I can feel it.

1728
01:23:12,396 --> 01:23:18,198
I look at you
and I... I'm home.

1729
01:23:20,037 --> 01:23:21,629
Please...

1730
01:23:21,672 --> 01:23:24,300
I don't want that to go away.

1731
01:23:24,341 --> 01:23:26,707
I don't want to forget.

1732
01:23:28,045 --> 01:23:32,106
I'm sorry, Dory, but I do.

1733
01:23:43,393 --> 01:23:46,658
- Manna from heaven.
- Sweet nectar of life!

1734
01:23:46,697 --> 01:23:48,756
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1735
01:23:48,799 --> 01:23:52,200
- This is our spot!
- Get outta here!

1736
01:23:53,537 --> 01:23:55,630
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1737
01:23:55,739 --> 01:23:57,206
Yeah, that's it, fella.

1738
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,867
Just keep on swimmin'.
You got that.

1739
01:23:58,909 --> 01:24:00,934
Too right, mate!

1740
01:24:00,977 --> 01:24:02,274
Oh! I got a live one here!

1741
01:24:02,312 --> 01:24:03,745
Have you seen my dad?

1742
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:06,010
Gotcha! Hey! Hey!
Come back here!

1743
01:24:06,049 --> 01:24:07,539
You let him go!

1744
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:09,720
Hey! Hey!

1745
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:14,214
Dad! Dad!

1746
01:24:14,257 --> 01:24:15,884
Dad!

1747
01:24:26,837 --> 01:24:29,237
Ohh!

1748
01:24:29,272 --> 01:24:32,332
Um, excuse me.

1749
01:24:32,376 --> 01:24:33,604
Are you all right?

1750
01:24:33,643 --> 01:24:36,271
I don't know where I am.
I don't know what's going on.

1751
01:24:36,313 --> 01:24:39,180
I think I lost somebody,
but I can't remember.

1752
01:24:39,216 --> 01:24:43,312
It's OK.
I'm looking for someone, too.

1753
01:24:43,353 --> 01:24:45,787
Hey, we can look together.

1754
01:24:45,822 --> 01:24:48,154
I'm Dory.

1755
01:24:48,191 --> 01:24:49,351
I'm Nemo.

1756
01:24:49,393 --> 01:24:52,760
Nemo? That's a nice name.

1757
01:25:01,705 --> 01:25:04,640
- Dad!
- Dad!

1758
01:25:04,674 --> 01:25:06,733
Wait a minute.
Is it your dad or my dad?

1759
01:25:06,777 --> 01:25:09,245
- My dad.
- Got it. Dad!

1760
01:25:09,279 --> 01:25:11,543
- Where are we, anyway?
- Dad! Dad!

1761
01:25:11,581 --> 01:25:15,483
Oh. Syl... Shi... Sydney.

1762
01:25:15,519 --> 01:25:19,785
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

1763
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:21,586
Aah! Nemo!

1764
01:25:21,625 --> 01:25:23,991
It's you! Aah!
You're Nemo!

1765
01:25:24,027 --> 01:25:25,688
Yes, yes, I'm Nemo!

1766
01:25:25,729 --> 01:25:28,323
You're Nemo!
You were dead. I saw you.

1767
01:25:28,365 --> 01:25:30,265
And here you are!
I found you.

1768
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:33,030
You're not dead.
And your father... Your father!

1769
01:25:33,069 --> 01:25:35,435
You know my father?!
Where is he?

1770
01:25:35,472 --> 01:25:38,305
This way!
He went this way. Quick!

1771
01:25:38,341 --> 01:25:39,968
<i>Hey, hey, hey!</i>

1772
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:41,170
Hey! Hey!

1773
01:25:41,211 --> 01:25:42,701
Have you seen
an orange fish swim by?

1774
01:25:42,746 --> 01:25:45,112
- It looks just like him!
- But bigger!

1775
01:25:45,148 --> 01:25:46,376
Yeah, I saw him, bluey.

1776
01:25:46,416 --> 01:25:47,883
But I'm not tellin' you
where he went...

1777
01:25:47,918 --> 01:25:53,457
and there's no way
you're gonna make me.

1778
01:25:53,457 --> 01:25:54,617
Mine.

1779
01:25:54,724 --> 01:25:57,488
Aah!
All right! I'll talk!

1780
01:25:57,527 --> 01:26:04,234
He went to
the fishing grounds! Aah!

1781
01:26:04,234 --> 01:26:06,099
Hey, look out!

1782
01:26:06,136 --> 01:26:08,627
I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to get home.

1783
01:26:09,673 --> 01:26:13,404
<i>Dad! Dad!</i>

1784
01:26:13,443 --> 01:26:14,842
Nemo?

1785
01:26:14,878 --> 01:26:17,346
- Daddy!
- Nemo?

1786
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:19,149
- Dad!
- Nemo's alive!

1787
01:26:19,149 --> 01:26:19,376
- Dad!
- Nemo's alive!

1788
01:26:19,416 --> 01:26:21,407
Dory? Nemo!

1789
01:26:21,451 --> 01:26:22,645
Daddy!

1790
01:26:22,686 --> 01:26:24,984
Nemo! I'm coming, Nemo!

1791
01:26:25,021 --> 01:26:28,684
- Dad!
- Nemo! Thank goodness.

1792
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:31,660
It's all right, son.
It's gonna be OK.

1793
01:26:31,695 --> 01:26:34,564
<i>Turn around!</i>
<i>You're going the wrong way!</i>

1794
01:26:37,067 --> 01:26:38,432
Aah! Look out!

1795
01:26:38,468 --> 01:26:41,096
Oh, my...

1796
01:26:57,821 --> 01:27:01,382
Help! He-e-elp!

1797
01:27:01,424 --> 01:27:03,016
- Dory!
- Come on!

1798
01:27:03,059 --> 01:27:04,458
Help! Help!

1799
01:27:04,494 --> 01:27:07,224
Help! Get us out! Aah!

1800
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:09,061
No, no, no! Dory!

1801
01:27:09,099 --> 01:27:12,091
- Dad, I know what to do!
- Nemo! No!

1802
01:27:12,135 --> 01:27:14,865
We have to tell all the fish
to swim down together!

1803
01:27:14,905 --> 01:27:17,601
- Get out of there now!
- I know this will work!

1804
01:27:17,641 --> 01:27:19,575
No, I am not
gonna lose you again!

1805
01:27:19,609 --> 01:27:23,045
There's no time!
It's the only way to save Dory!

1806
01:27:24,347 --> 01:27:25,814
I can do this.

1807
01:27:26,983 --> 01:27:29,110
You're right.

1808
01:27:29,152 --> 01:27:30,983
I know you can.

1809
01:27:31,021 --> 01:27:33,922
- Lucky fin!
- Now, go! Hurry!

1810
01:27:33,957 --> 01:27:36,755
Tell all the fish to swim down!

1811
01:27:36,793 --> 01:27:40,160
Well? You heard my son!
Come on!

1812
01:27:41,665 --> 01:27:44,293
Dory, you have
to tell everybody to...

1813
01:27:44,334 --> 01:27:45,858
Swim down together!

1814
01:27:45,902 --> 01:27:48,166
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

1815
01:27:48,204 --> 01:27:50,468
Swim down!

1816
01:27:54,811 --> 01:27:56,039
Everybody swim down!

1817
01:27:56,079 --> 01:27:58,604
Come on,
you have to swim down!

1818
01:27:58,648 --> 01:28:01,344
Down! Swim down!

1819
01:28:03,453 --> 01:28:07,082
Swim down! Swim down!

1820
01:28:14,798 --> 01:28:17,198
Don't give up!
Keep swimming!

1821
01:28:17,233 --> 01:28:19,667
Just keep swimming!

1822
01:28:23,907 --> 01:28:25,534
That's it!

1823
01:28:28,478 --> 01:28:30,469
It's working!

1824
01:28:32,916 --> 01:28:35,942
Keep swimming!
Keep swimming!

1825
01:28:35,986 --> 01:28:38,113
Just keep swimming!
Keep swimming!

1826
01:28:38,154 --> 01:28:39,621
Come on, Dad!

1827
01:28:39,656 --> 01:28:42,147
- You're doing great, son!
- That's my dad.

1828
01:28:42,192 --> 01:28:44,490
Let's get to the bottom!
Keep swimming!

1829
01:28:44,527 --> 01:28:47,052
<i>Just keep swimming,</i>
<i>just keep swimming</i>

1830
01:28:47,097 --> 01:28:49,292
Almost there!
Keep swimming!

1831
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:54,200
Keep swimming!

1832
01:28:56,506 --> 01:28:57,632
Keep swimming!

1833
01:29:08,051 --> 01:29:09,518
- Oof!
- Hey!

1834
01:29:09,552 --> 01:29:13,147
- Dory! Where's Nemo?
- There!

1835
01:29:14,858 --> 01:29:17,918
Oh, no. Nemo!

1836
01:29:23,867 --> 01:29:25,767
Nemo?

1837
01:29:27,437 --> 01:29:29,735
Nemo?

1838
01:29:29,773 --> 01:29:33,766
<i>It's OK. Daddy's here.</i>
<i>Daddy's got you.</i>

1839
01:29:38,214 --> 01:29:39,374
Daddy?

1840
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:40,940
Oh, thank goodness.

1841
01:29:40,984 --> 01:29:44,681
Dad... I don't hate you.

1842
01:29:44,721 --> 01:29:46,552
Oh, no, no, no.

1843
01:29:46,589 --> 01:29:49,251
I'm so sorry, Nemo.

1844
01:29:58,501 --> 01:30:01,368
- Hey, guess what?
- What?

1845
01:30:01,404 --> 01:30:04,896
Sea turtles... I met one.

1846
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:09,139
And he was 150 years old.

1847
01:30:09,179 --> 01:30:13,343
- 150?
- Yep.

1848
01:30:13,383 --> 01:30:18,218
Sandy Plankton said
they only live to be 100.

1849
01:30:18,254 --> 01:30:19,812
Sandy Plankton?

1850
01:30:19,856 --> 01:30:21,847
Do you think I would
cross the entire ocean...

1851
01:30:21,891 --> 01:30:23,984
and not know as much
as Sandy Plankton?

1852
01:30:24,027 --> 01:30:26,689
- Ha ha ha!
- He was 150! Not 100!

1853
01:30:26,730 --> 01:30:30,598
Who is this Sandy Plankton
who knows everything?

1854
01:30:32,302 --> 01:30:32,902
Time for school!
Get up! Let's go!

1855
01:30:32,902 --> 01:30:35,894
Time for school!
Get up! Let's go!

1856
01:30:35,939 --> 01:30:39,033
- I'm gonna win!
- No, you're not!

1857
01:30:39,075 --> 01:30:42,841
- I did it!
- Aw, my own son beats me!

1858
01:30:42,879 --> 01:30:45,347
Climb aboard, explorers.

1859
01:30:45,381 --> 01:30:48,509
The sea cucumber looks over
to the mollusk and says...

1860
01:30:48,551 --> 01:30:51,418
"With fronds like these,
who needs anemones?"

1861
01:30:53,123 --> 01:30:55,353
Hello, Nemo. Who's this?

1862
01:30:55,458 --> 01:30:58,916
- Exchange student.
- I'm from the E.A.C., dude!

1863
01:30:58,962 --> 01:31:01,590
- Sweet!
- Totally.

1864
01:31:01,631 --> 01:31:03,599
Seriously, Marty.

1865
01:31:03,633 --> 01:31:05,601
Did you really do all
the things you say you did?

1866
01:31:05,635 --> 01:31:07,330
<i>Pardon me.</i>

1867
01:31:07,370 --> 01:31:10,066
- Hello.
- Ohh.

1868
01:31:10,106 --> 01:31:11,767
Don't be alarmed.

1869
01:31:11,808 --> 01:31:15,574
We wanted to make sure our
newest member got home safely.

1870
01:31:15,612 --> 01:31:17,944
- Thanks, guys.
- See you next week.

1871
01:31:17,981 --> 01:31:21,439
- Keep up with the program.
- Remember, fish are friends...

1872
01:31:21,484 --> 01:31:23,850
Not food! Bye!

1873
01:31:23,887 --> 01:31:25,752
Hold on, here we go!

1874
01:31:25,789 --> 01:31:27,484
Next stop... knowledge!

1875
01:31:27,524 --> 01:31:29,992
Bye, son! Have fun!

1876
01:31:30,026 --> 01:31:31,323
Bye, Dad!

1877
01:31:31,361 --> 01:31:34,797
Oh! Mr. Ray, wait.
I forgot something.

1878
01:31:39,469 --> 01:31:42,097
Love you, Dad.

1879
01:31:42,138 --> 01:31:44,129
I love you, too, son.

1880
01:31:46,409 --> 01:31:49,810
Dad? You can let go now.

1881
01:31:49,846 --> 01:31:53,577
Sorry. Go have an adventure.

1882
01:31:53,616 --> 01:31:55,846
Good-bye!
See ya later, dudes!

1883
01:31:55,952 --> 01:31:58,386
- Bye, Elmo!
- Nemo.

1884
01:31:58,421 --> 01:32:01,879
- Bye, Nemo!
- See you after school, Dory!

1885
01:32:01,925 --> 01:32:02,325
Bye, Dad!

1886
01:32:02,325 --> 01:32:04,793
Bye, Dad!

1887
01:32:04,828 --> 01:32:06,921
Bye, son.

1888
01:32:23,947 --> 01:32:26,939
Barbara,
I don't understand it.

1889
01:32:26,983 --> 01:32:29,349
Here this thing has
a lifetime guarantee...

1890
01:32:29,385 --> 01:32:30,613
and it breaks!

1891
01:32:30,653 --> 01:32:32,951
I had to clean the tank myself,
take all the fish out...

1892
01:32:32,989 --> 01:32:35,355
put 'em in bags, and...

1893
01:32:35,391 --> 01:32:37,882
Where'd the fish go?

1894
01:32:42,732 --> 01:32:44,461
- Come on, Peach!
- Hurry!

1895
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:46,331
- You can do it!
- That's it.

1896
01:32:46,369 --> 01:32:47,802
Just a little further.

1897
01:32:47,837 --> 01:32:50,067
That's the shortest
red light I've ever seen!

1898
01:32:50,106 --> 01:32:52,336
- Come on, Peach!
- Ohh. Aah!

1899
01:33:01,684 --> 01:33:03,481
Now what?

1900
01:33:10,985 --> 01:33:14,113
<i>Somewhere</i>

1901
01:33:14,155 --> 01:33:16,316
<i>Beyond the sea</i>

1902
01:33:16,357 --> 01:33:21,488
<i>Somewhere,</i>
<i>waitin' for me</i>

1903
01:33:21,529 --> 01:33:26,466
<i>My lover stands</i>
<i>on golden sands</i>

1904
01:33:26,501 --> 01:33:28,901
<i>And watches the ships</i>

1905
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:32,964
<i>That go sailin'</i>

1906
01:33:33,007 --> 01:33:35,942
<i>Somewhere</i>

1907
01:33:35,977 --> 01:33:38,309
<i>Beyond the sea</i>

1908
01:33:38,346 --> 01:33:43,443
<i>She's there</i>
<i>watchin' for me</i>

1909
01:33:43,484 --> 01:33:48,319
<i>If I could fly</i>
<i>like birds on high</i>

1910
01:33:48,356 --> 01:33:51,052
<i>Then straight</i>
<i>to her arms</i>

1911
01:33:51,092 --> 01:33:54,755
<i>I'll go sailin'</i>

1912
01:33:54,796 --> 01:33:57,856
<i>It's far</i>

1913
01:33:57,899 --> 01:34:00,561
<i>Beyond the stars</i>

1914
01:34:00,602 --> 01:34:04,538
<i>It's near,</i>
<i>beyond the moon</i>

1915
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:08,976
<i>I know</i>

1916
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:11,137
<i>Beyond a doubt</i>

1917
01:34:11,179 --> 01:34:13,147
<i>My heart</i>

1918
01:34:13,181 --> 01:34:16,708
<i>Will lead me there soon</i>

1919
01:34:16,751 --> 01:34:19,720
<i>We'll meet</i>

1920
01:34:19,754 --> 01:34:22,279
<i>Beyond the shore</i>

1921
01:34:22,323 --> 01:34:27,192
<i>We'll kiss</i>
<i>just like before</i>

1922
01:34:27,228 --> 01:34:32,063
<i>Happy we'll be</i>
<i>beyond the sea</i>

1923
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:34,432
<i>And never again</i>

1924
01:34:34,469 --> 01:34:38,337
<i>I'll go sailin'</i>

1925
01:35:10,104 --> 01:35:14,632
<i>I know</i>

1926
01:35:14,676 --> 01:35:17,304
<i>Beyond a doubt</i>

1927
01:35:17,345 --> 01:35:19,245
<i>My heart</i>

1928
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:22,977
<i>Will lead me there soon</i>

1929
01:35:23,017 --> 01:35:25,781
<i>Oh, we'll meet,</i>
<i>I know we'll meet</i>

1930
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:28,220
<i>Beyond the shore</i>

1931
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:33,387
<i>We'll kiss</i>
<i>just as before</i>

1932
01:35:33,428 --> 01:35:38,388
<i>Happy we will be</i>
<i>beyond the sea</i>

1933
01:35:38,433 --> 01:35:40,560
<i>And never again</i>

1934
01:35:40,601 --> 01:35:44,230
<i>I'll go sailin'</i>

1935
01:35:46,274 --> 01:35:48,640
<i>No more sailin'</i>

1936
01:35:50,011 --> 01:35:53,378
<i>So long,</i>
<i>sailin', sailin'</i>

1937
01:35:53,414 --> 01:35:55,712
<i>No more sailin'</i>

1938
01:35:57,318 --> 01:36:01,311
<i>Good-bye, farewell,</i>
<i>my friend</i>

1939
01:36:01,355 --> 01:36:03,118
<i>No more sailin'</i>

1940
01:36:05,226 --> 01:36:06,989

<i>Farewell</i>

1945
01:36:19,741 --> 01:36:21,606
<i>Auf wiedersehen</i>

1946
01:36:21,642 --> 01:36:25,009
