1
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:38,321
All right, Josh.

2
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,061
Time to go.

3
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,497
Five more minutes.

4
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,633
No. I'm counting to 3,

5
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,233
and then I'm going to get mad.

6
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,437
Five more minutes!

7
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:54,309
1...

8
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,405
2...

9
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,974
2 1/2...

10
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,883
Come on.

11
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,546
What do you want for dinner?

12
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,554
Chinese.

13
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,920
You had Chinese last night.

14
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:06,788
I have to eat it every day.

15
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,792
Why?

16
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,007
Be a
kung fu master.

17
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:11,462
Well, show me your moves, Jackie Chan.

18
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,458
You ready for your tournament tonight?

19
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,127
Yeah. I'm going to make him bleed.

20
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:18,568
I'm going to make him cry.

21
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,503
I'm going to make him
run home to his mama.

22
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,541
- Who?
- Michael. I hate him.

23
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:23,576
He's, like, your friend.

24
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,611
Not anymore.

25
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:26,702
Why not?

26
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:27,905
Because he picks on people.

27
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:28,970
Does he pick on you?

28
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:31,243
Sometimes.

29
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,182
I'm going to talk to
his mother about that.

30
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,921
No! Mom!

31
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,083
Help!

32
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,592
Turn on the lights.

33
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:20,493
Write this down.

34
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,262
7:12 p.m.

35
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:29,468
You okay?

36
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,474
Yeah.

37
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,170
So what did you see?

38
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,746
You don't want to know.

39
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:42,151
Yes, I do. You think I do this
for the great benefits package?

40
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,792
Jenna, don't forget your
shrink appointment today.

41
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,987
I don't want to hear
you skipped another one.

42
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:54,993
Oh. Thanks, Jenna.
Thanks for helping.

43
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,003
Thanks for keeping my brain stable
while I jump through time.

44
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,198
No problem, Sam.
Glad I could help.

45
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:36,035
The things that she can cook... meatloaf.

46
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,703
So I got home,
and she's wearing her negligee...

47
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,128
You know it's good
if you burn your mouth.

48
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:57,184
Let's go.

49
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:58,491
That's the guy?

50
00:04:58,564 --> 00:04:59,826
That's the psychic?

51
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,761
Laugh all you want,

52
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:05,599
but that psychic's
put 22 perps behind bars.

53
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,276
He took the car,
but it's not what he was after.

54
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,110
The purse?

55
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:19,083
It was her. He was there to kill her.

56
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,619
It was a hit... murder for hire.

57
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,748
Who hired him, Sam?

58
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,553
It's in his cell phone records.

59
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,821
He made a phone call 12 after 7.

60
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,700
- Come on. How does he know this stuff?
- Never mind.

61
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,759
Get the ex-husband's phone records.

62
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,361
See if he received a call
at 7:12 that night.

63
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,306
I suspected the ex,
the way that kid's left unharmed.

64
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,275
Excuse me, Detective, uh...

65
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,402
Nicholas.

66
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,742
The kid wasn't unharmed.

67
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,475
He saw his mother
bludgeoned to death.

68
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:54,285
I assume my check is downstairs.

69
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:57,514
I don't know
how you know what you know,

70
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,251
but I know that you ain't no psychic.

71
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:00,952
Prove me wrong.

72
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,722
Tell me the first thing
my wife ever said to me.

73
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,165
Real psychics know
that kind of shit, Sam.

74
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,094
I look forward to your
next call, Detective.

75
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:29,546
So this ought to settle us up
for this month and next.

76
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:33,285
Look at you. Ain't you
the sweetest thing?

77
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,623
The way you take care of your sister.

78
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,220
About as sweet as pumpkin pie.

79
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:39,958
Yes, you are.

80
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:41,624
How sweet is pumpkin pie

81
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,829
with some whipped cream
on that sweet little ass of yours?

82
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,165
Yeah, uh, you know,

83
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,673
I actually got to get going

84
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,606
because I got ice cream
in the groceries.

85
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:53,509
I need to introduce you
to my niece Roxanne.

86
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,807
I'd love to meet her.

87
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,712
Okay. I'll get her number for you.

88
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,011
Yeah. Okay.

89
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,950
You stay right there. I'll be right back.

90
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,180
Right.

91
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,088
Jenna.

92
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,096
Didn't hear me knocking?

93
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,101
Didn't know it was you.

94
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,134
Who'd you think it was?

95
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,298
Gestapo.

96
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:27,672
You ever open up a window in here?

97
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,238
What, and lose the ambiance?

98
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:37,213
You're never gonna believe
what happened last night.

99
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,279
Try me.

100
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:43,192
The Kalowitzes next door
were up late fighting.

101
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:44,820
Shocking.

102
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:47,092
Let me get to the good part.

103
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,896
She drops the D-bomb.

104
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,800
Divorce?

105
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:54,635
So it looks like Apartment 3-B
might be opening up.

106
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:56,231
You could grab it.
We could be neighbors.

107
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,005
Yeah, then you could stay up late
eavesdropping on me.

108
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:02,309
Oh, yeah. Eavesdropping
on your exciting social life.

109
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,051
Those things will fucking kill ya.

110
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,211
Godspeed.

111
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:16,155
So how was work, Mr. Police Psychic?

112
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,925
We ever find out
who killed Mommy in the park?

113
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:19,930
Get an I. D?

114
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:25,201
Yeah. It was some gun the ex hired.

115
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,239
It's always the ex.

116
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,330
I should warn Peggy

117
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:31,501
before she serves Kevin
those divorce papers.

118
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,943
To do that, you'd actually
have to leave your apartment.

119
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:38,745
Sorry. That was just a joke.

120
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,948
Anyway, I leave my apartment.

121
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:46,287
In fact, I went out just this morning
to see my psychoanalyst.

122
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,348
Great.

123
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,260
No, seriously, Jenna.
That's... That's great.

124
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,854
What did she have to say?

125
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,465
She agreed with me
that it's really unhealthy

126
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,970
that we never talk about
what happened in the fire.

127
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,863
Please! Let me out!

128
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:08,072
She said that the more
I know about what happened,

129
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,341
the more I'll be free of it.

130
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,981
Seriously. Can we talk about it?

131
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,281
What is there to talk about?

132
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,083
Jenna, were you gonna pay this, or...

133
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,317
The police said that it was a gas leak,

134
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,986
but you came in from outside.

135
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,365
I smelled smoke.

136
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:28,730
I didn't know where
it was coming from.

137
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:29,927
I thought it was
the neighbor's house,

138
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,970
- so I went outside to look.
- And you got a ladder?

139
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,165
- Yeah!
- It just doesn't make any sense.

140
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,731
How did you have time
to go to the shed and get a ladder...

141
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,299
You know, I don't remember, Jenna!

142
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,935
I don't remember!

143
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:42,674
I don't want to remember!
I was 15 years old.

144
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,586
Is that enough, Jenna?
Is the interrogation over?

145
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,421
Ice cream's in the freezer.

146
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,157
Sam.

147
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,295
Thanks for the groceries.

148
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,202
What are you doing tomorrow?

149
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,743
You want to come over for dinner?

150
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,177
I could make a casserole.

151
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,611
Yeah. I'll come by tomorrow.

152
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:17,972
Promise?

153
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,019
What are we, in the third grade?

154
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,055
Promise?

155
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,612
Pinky swear.

156
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,055
All right.

157
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,553
Get some sleep tonight, okay?

158
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,924
Can I help you?

159
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,935
You don't recognize me.

160
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,068
Elizabeth Brown?

161
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,437
Rebecca's sister?

162
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,243
Nice to see you, too.

163
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,477
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:27,883
Come on in.

165
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,620
Nice place.

166
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,386
Thank you. Yes. It's all right.

167
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,992
Here, let me clean off
this seat for you...

168
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,690
No. Don't. Sam, don't worry about it.

169
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,891
Get this crap out of the way.

170
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:43,264
So what brings you to my part of town?

171
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,566
I came... I came back for the execution.

172
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:51,306
They're executing Lonnie on Friday.

173
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,366
Lethal injection.

174
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,403
Lonnie... Lonnie Flennons.

175
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,641
The guy that ki...

176
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,641
The guy they say killed Rebecca.

177
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,422
Sam...

178
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,890
You act like you don't
know what I'm talking about.

179
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,256
No, I... I...

180
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,954
Yeah. Of course.

181
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,395
I just hadn't thought
about Rebecca in a long time,

182
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,560
that's all.

183
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:21,000
You want a drink?

184
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,771
It's clean.

185
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:30,709
So...

186
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,409
What are you doing here?

187
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,215
Lonnie didn't kill my sister.

188
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,551
- And how do you know that?
- Well...

189
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:43,994
Because I found this diary
when I was helping my parents move.

190
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:46,861
Rebecca wrote about you a lot, Sam.

191
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,524
About how much she loved you.

192
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,796
Do you remember when

193
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,202
Lonnie tried to convince
the jury during the trial

194
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,366
that, you know, they were...

195
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,966
having a relationship?

196
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,840
- Do you remember?
- Yeah, I remember.

197
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,081
It was true, Sam.

198
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,777
Rebecca was cheating on you.

199
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,341
I know this hurts.

200
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:12,355
Look. May 18th, 1998.

201
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:13,982
"Someone has been following me.

202
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,054
"It's definitely not Sam.

203
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,064
"He doesn't know about Lonnie,
but I have to tell him.

204
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,827
"I feel so guilty.

205
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:22,833
I don't know what to do."

206
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,393
I took this diary to the cops.

207
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:27,394
They say it's...

208
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,636
it's not sufficient evidence
to reopen the case.

209
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:34,776
- Well, if that's what they say...
- And then,

210
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,975
I talked to your friend.
Detective Glenn?

211
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,143
Sam...

212
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:45,521
he told me that you have a way
of knowing things

213
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,183
that nobody else knows?

214
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,124
That... That you can...

215
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,186
see into crime.

216
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,424
Sam, I want to hire you.

217
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,798
I have $5,000 in cash.

218
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:57,927
Okay?

219
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,528
Here.

220
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,574
- I can't, Elizabeth.
- Why?

221
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,270
- It's complicated. I'm sorry.
- Complicated.

222
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,109
But...

223
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,274
the guy that killed Rebecca got away.

224
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:16,012
And Lonnie Flennons, an innocent man,

225
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:18,454
a man she loved,

226
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,650
is going to die.

227
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:23,826
I wish I could help.

228
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,830
I do. I...

229
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:26,990
I'm sorry.

230
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,533
Sam...

231
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:31,693
Okay.

232
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:40,441
Elizabeth.

233
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:42,876
You forgot this.

234
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,116
Keep it.

235
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:47,516
She would have wanted you to have it.

236
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,359
So, um...

237
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,527
Tell me about this dead girl.

238
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:05,900
Did you love her?

239
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,631
Rebecca Brown,

240
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,642
first girl I ever fell for.

241
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,940
You never thought about
jumping back before?

242
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,571
Thought about it
a hundred times. I just...

243
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:18,344
But you'd know better.

244
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,113
Sam, this is serious shit.

245
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,654
There's two big rules.

246
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:26,748
You never jump back
to alter your own past.

247
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,725
And you never jump unsupervised.

248
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:33,094
What if I just go back
and nobody sees me?

249
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:34,462
If I...

250
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:37,161
If I do exactly as you
taught me and just observe?

251
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:41,002
Come on, man.
Let's be honest with ourselves.

252
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,303
Do you really think
that you can go back

253
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,343
and watch your girlfriend get murdered,

254
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,470
- and not intervene?
- I've seen dozens of people

255
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,740
killed right before my eyes,

256
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:49,803
and I haven't lifted a finger.

257
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,315
Well, this is different, Sam.

258
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,977
You've seen for yourself
what happens if you...

259
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,350
if you break these rules.

260
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,154
Your sister dies in a fire.

261
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,488
You jump back, thinking
you can save her.

262
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,323
And you do.

263
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,760
But what you didn't expect

264
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,388
was that your parents
were gonna die instead.

265
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,998
You try to save one life. You kill two.

266
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,437
How many times you gotta
jump back before you know the rules?

267
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,701
15? 20? Enough to know I don't
want to do it any more.

268
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:20,836
Exactly. You know,
you nearly fried your brain.

269
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,972
You can't handle that many overlaps.

270
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:24,845
It'll drive you crazy.

271
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,441
Can we get another
round here, sweetheart?

272
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,178
Save it, Goldburg.

273
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,223
You gave me an "F"
in freshman physics, remember?

274
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,088
You're never gonna let me live it down.

275
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,421
You start tipping, I might.

276
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:37,855
Keep the change.

277
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,329
Everybody's happy.

278
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,401
I know it's hard, man.

279
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,562
But for whatever reason,

280
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,298
your girl Rebecca had to die.

281
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,533
And I've had to live with it.

282
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,577
Not saving someone's life

283
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:56,273
isn't the same thing
as killing them, Sam.

284
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,474
No.

285
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,243
But it's close.

286
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,086
You do a good thing, Sam.

287
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,285
You bring a lot of closure to people.

288
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,260
Everybody but myself.

289
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,956
You gotta stop living in the past.

290
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,555
You gotta get this girl out of your mind.

291
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:14,860
She's dead.

292
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,094
You're never gonna see her again.

293
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,730
And if you want to help
this poor death-row bastard,

294
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:25,038
then you better find a way
to do it in the here and now.

295
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,341
It's like my ex-wife
used to say before she

296
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,712
ran off to Ecuador
with the fucking gardener.

297
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,581
You gotta live in the moment, man.

298
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,258
This one's on the house.

299
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:48,663
Thanks.

300
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,326
What is it?

301
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,630
A buttery nipple.

302
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,290
Come on!

303
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:14,052
Uh! Hurry!

304
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:28,932
What's wrong?

305
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,149
I'm sorry. I can't.

306
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,516
I just can't.

307
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,584
Come on.

308
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:47,716
Please.

309
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:51,157
Vicky, I need to be alone right now.

310
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,530
Do you want to talk about it?

311
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:56,966
No.

312
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,832
Oh, okay.

313
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,173
That's fine.

314
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,103
I really know how to pick 'em, huh?

315
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,947
It's nothing personal.

316
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:13,041
What?

317
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,114
Are you... Are you gay?

318
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,987
I could introduce you
to my friend Brendan.

319
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:22,424
He's gay, too. Maybe you guys
could hang out!

320
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,257
Well, I'll be sure to
give you his number,

321
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,958
and you can go,
you know, do man things.

322
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,523
Sound good?

323
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,420
Rebecca...

324
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:12,636
Lonnie...

325
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,694
Hey, Liz. It's Sam.

326
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:37,200
I changed my mind.

327
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,531
I'll help you out.

328
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,513
You got five minutes.

329
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:04,994
Hello.

330
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,497
<i>Hey, Lonnie.</i>

331
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,967
<i>Sam Reide. Remember me?</i>

332
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:14,005
<i>South Pontiac High.</i>

333
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:15,596
South Pontiac Grizzly Bears.

334
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:25,816
<i>I'm here to help you.</i>

335
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:33,723
<i>Look, Lonnie. I know
you didn't kill Rebecca Brown.</i>

336
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,530
<i>Jesus, Lonnie. Say something.</i>

337
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,601
Why are you here?

338
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,002
<i>I just told you.</i>

339
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:48,369
You here to laugh at me?

340
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,907
No, look, Lonnie.

341
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,966
I know you loved Rebecca.

342
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,375
I know she loved you.

343
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,845
I know what was going on.

344
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,348
She wrote all about it, right here.

345
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,915
<i>What are you trying to do?</i>

346
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,051
<i>We can get a new trial.</i>

347
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:14,228
<i>Look, Lonnie.
I don't think you heard me.</i>

348
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,425
<i>This is new evidence.</i>

349
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,024
The police don't want to reopen the case,

350
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,002
but we can request a stay of execution.

351
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,629
New evidence. New trial.

352
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,071
<i>- You'll be exonerated.
- No.</i>

353
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,140
<i>Do you understand?</i>

354
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,343
<i>- I'm sending this to your lawyer.
- No.</i>

355
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,175
Lonnie, would you just look at the diary!

356
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:35,583
<i>It was you.</i>

357
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:39,413
You killed her.

358
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:44,087
<i>And I've been locked
in here for 10 years!</i>

359
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:47,461
<i>And you've been free!</i>

360
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,057
You can't come in here
and do this to me!

361
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:54,367
<i>You can't pretend
to be the good guy now!</i>

362
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:55,997
<i>It's not fair!</i>

363
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:58,906
It's not fair!

364
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,842
You did it, Sam!

365
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:02,243
You should be in here!

366
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:04,248
Let's go. You did it, Sam!

367
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:05,783
It's not fair!

368
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:07,409
<i>It's not fair.</i>

369
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:35,010
I'll never get used to this cold.

370
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,513
So what's on the menu tonight?

371
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,550
Homicide? Rape?
Vehicular manslaughter?

372
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,647
Rebecca Brown.

373
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,714
Sam, what are you doing?

374
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,885
It's okay, Jenna.

375
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,951
Just give me the numbers.

376
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,360
You're breaking the rules.

377
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,830
They're my rules to break.

378
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,697
You can't save her, Sam.

379
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,793
I can do this here, the safe way,

380
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:03,239
or I can do it at home by myself
and risk everything.

381
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:04,832
- Sam...
- Either way, I'm gonna do it.

382
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,639
This is a bad idea.

383
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:09,009
The numbers.

384
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:23,085
June 6th, 1998.

385
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:26,255
Murder happened
approximately 12:40 a.m.

386
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:27,730
on a Saturday.

387
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:12,933
Who's in there?

388
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:15,947
I have a fucking gun.

389
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,572
Liz. Liz. It's me.

390
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:19,276
Sam?

391
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,841
What are you doing?

392
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,580
No, no, no. It's cool.

393
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:24,781
No. My parents are
out of town this weekend.

394
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,324
- No, no...
- Come on. I got some wine coolers...

395
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:28,825
- Becky calls it "bitch beer."
- Lock the doors...

396
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:31,158
- You want some bitch beer?
- Get back in the car!

397
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:33,929
- I'm not getting back in my car...
- Listen.

398
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:36,729
You're in danger.
This is serious, okay?

399
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,433
Get in the car.

400
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:42,234
Okay?

401
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:43,706
Come on.

402
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,337
Keep the doors locked.

403
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:50,745
If you see anything, honk your horn.

404
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:51,941
Okay?

405
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,519
Rebecca?

406
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,209
Elizabeth! Elizabeth!

407
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,804
Hey, man. You okay?

408
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:34,141
Who are you?

409
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,737
Paco. You know?

410
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:37,804
I rent your couch.

411
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:41,012
I rent out my couch?

412
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,077
<i>It's the recession, pendejo.</i>

413
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,623
- Where are my car keys?
- Car keys?

414
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:52,162
You don't have a car.

415
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,818
You gotta stop showing up here.

416
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:25,624
I need the case file on
the Rebecca Brown murder.

417
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:27,392
This is the last time.

418
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,784
So who's this guy?

419
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:49,877
He was a suspect
in the Brown murder 10 years ago.

420
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,649
But now he's obsessed with the case.

421
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:54,454
What, do you think
he might be our guy?

422
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:56,255
I think he's just a lost soul.

423
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:58,553
Hey, let's show him the others.

424
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,961
What?

425
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:02,022
If he's the killer, we'll know.

426
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,873
Paper's calling our guy
the "Pontiac Killer."

427
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:14,207
You like that name?

428
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,837
What's his pattern?

429
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:18,644
He tracks young women,
and cuts them apart.

430
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:20,877
Eight victims so far, that we know of.

431
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,510
It's about one a year.

432
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:26,583
Any leads?

433
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,888
You got a lot of questions, buddy.

434
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,086
Yeah, well...

435
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,795
You don't seem to have any answers.

436
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:54,475
<i>Hello?</i>

437
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:55,484
Jenna. Hey.

438
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:57,817
Sam.

439
00:30:57,889 --> 00:30:59,618
Where have you been? You okay?

440
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,783
<i>I've been trying to reach you.</i>

441
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,417
Uh, no. I'm fine. I'm fine.

442
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:03,482
I just... I need some help.

443
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:04,960
What's wrong? You need money?

444
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,394
No. No...

445
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:07,488
Listen.

446
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:09,965
Jenna, do you remember
Lonnie Flennons?

447
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:13,765
Of course I do, every time I see
his stupid commercials.

448
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:16,136
<i>Flennons and Monohan,
Attorneys at Law.</i>

449
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,232
<i>- He's a lawyer?
- Sam.</i>

450
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:20,675
<i>You need to leave Lonnie alone.</i>

451
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:21,803
What are you talking about?

452
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,938
Did you jump again?

453
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:27,379
<i>You did, didn't you?
I thought we talked about this.</i>

454
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:28,680
<i>Sam, I'm worried about you...</i>

455
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:30,414
Uh, Jenna...

456
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:31,978
Don't worry about it, okay?

457
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,614
I'll be by later,
and I'll explain everything.

458
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:34,680
<i>Okay...</i>

459
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,567
Which office is Lonnie Flennons'?

460
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,367
Do you have an appointment?

461
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:50,270
- Is it this one?
- Sir, you can't go in there.

462
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:52,036
Sir! Sir! You can't go in there!

463
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,134
You can't go in there! Sir!

464
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:54,803
I need to talk to you.

465
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:56,312
I'm sorry. I told him
he couldn't come in...

466
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,212
It's okay. We're old friends.

467
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,787
Where were you
the night of the murders?

468
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,349
What is this?

469
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:12,726
Huh? Is this our anniversary?

470
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:15,789
You come in here, and you ask me
the same question every five years?

471
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,391
I want to know where you were.

472
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:20,369
You still think I was involved?

473
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,838
Aw, come on.

474
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:25,933
Huh? Look, everybody knows
Becky and Elizabeth

475
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,807
were victims of the Pontiac Killer.

476
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:30,541
Jesus. Where you been,
living under a rock?

477
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,947
Tell me where you were!

478
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,013
The night they were killed,

479
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:41,058
I thought of stopping by the house.

480
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,855
Rebecca called me and told me
her parents were out of town.

481
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:47,261
I saw you and Elizabeth talking outside.

482
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:48,890
I thought I should steer clear.

483
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,491
She hadn't told you about us.

484
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:52,934
I went home, and that was that.

485
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:56,371
I was cleared of all charges.

486
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:57,908
Yeah. Let's just say

487
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,807
your name's been added back
to the suspect pool.

488
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:12,045
I'm all for antidiscrimination.

489
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:14,887
Hell, I made my living at it.

490
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,051
Come on, Sam.

491
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:17,788
Lonnie, what happened?

492
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:18,886
Stop it.

493
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:20,430
When did this happen?

494
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,361
You don't remember?

495
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:25,493
I forget things sometimes.

496
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,130
I get confused. I get mixed up.

497
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:29,969
"Hey, Lonnie, let's get together.

498
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:31,906
Let's have a drink."

499
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:35,036
And then one drink turns into 20 drinks,

500
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:36,774
and then you get a cab that night.

501
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,748
How long ago was this?

502
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,683
June 6th, 2003.

503
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,345
It was five years after the...

504
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:46,053
God.

505
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,620
I'm sorry.

506
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:54,958
I'm sorry.

507
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:58,002
You know, for the longest time,
I was convinced

508
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:00,128
you killed the Brown sisters.

509
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,764
- Me?
- Yeah.

510
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,139
Rebecca was always afraid
you'd find out about us.

511
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,644
She always thought
you were watching her.

512
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,477
You know, waiting
around the corner, spying.

513
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,483
Did you kill them, Sam?

514
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,111
No.

515
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,053
I didn't.

516
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:37,199
I spent years teaching
you to use your gift,

517
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:41,075
and now you've created
the Pontiac Killer.

518
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:44,581
Shit, man.

519
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:47,917
- I can fix it, though.
- Good.

520
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:50,249
If I just jump back to the night Rebecca
and Elizabeth were killed,

521
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:52,186
except an hour earlier this time.

522
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,723
Well, that's not going to work.

523
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:55,656
I'll tell you,

524
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:58,092
you go back to a time
that you've already jumped,

525
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:01,029
you're going to end up
frying your brain.

526
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,693
Hey, hey, hey, don't sniff that.

527
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:07,397
Unless you really want to lie on the floor
here paralyzed for the next hour.

528
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:10,669
That right there... that's Burundanga.

529
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:13,733
It's the Devil's Breath.

530
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:16,837
And you grow this because...

531
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:19,212
It's fucking Detroit, man.

532
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,148
Put a few of those under my window.

533
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,517
Cheaper than buying a burglar alarm.

534
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:30,192
Okay, so what if I go back
four hours before the murders?

535
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:31,853
Won't work.

536
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:35,092
Goldburg, I've created a serial killer.

537
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,794
I have to stop him.

538
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,030
Okay. Here's what you can do.

539
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:42,868
You said there's eight murders, right?

540
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:47,143
Okay. So go back to the next one,
victim number three.

541
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:51,011
- Well, wait. What about Elizabeth?
- No, no, no. Stop. Stop.

542
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:53,016
You got to stick to the rules.

543
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,951
Stick to the rules.

544
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,955
Just observe. Observe.

545
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:01,924
Like you always do.

546
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,427
This victim number three...

547
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,020
it's nobody you know, right?

548
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:08,224
Right.

549
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:10,267
Good.

550
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,802
Then you ID the killer.

551
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:16,738
I mean, beyond the shadow
of a frickin' doubt.

552
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:20,633
Then you go to the police,

553
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:23,407
drop them a note, turn him in.

554
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:25,949
And then there's just one more thing.

555
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:30,181
You'll be altering...

556
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:32,848
the course of events significantly.

557
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,389
So when you get back...

558
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,451
That is, if it worked.

559
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,724
When you come back...

560
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:43,198
No, thank you.

561
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,665
Shit, I lost my train of thought.
What were we talking about?

562
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:50,604
It's okay, Goldburg. I think I got it.

563
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:53,735
I come back,
the serial killer's behind bars.

564
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:56,371
Serial killer. That's right.
Yeah. That's it.

565
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:58,745
Behind the bars. Yeah. That's good.

566
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:01,341
Thanks, Goldburg. You're brilliant.

567
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,387
Brilliant. Yeah, okay.

568
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:05,354
Thought you were going to say "sexy."

569
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,891
That's okay. No problem.

570
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,790
Still going to have a good day.

571
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,863
Hey, wait. Don't forget.

572
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,693
Jenna put in an order.

573
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,903
I can't get over there today.

574
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:35,213
Nice of you to show up.

575
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:36,981
Mmm. Cleaned up?

576
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:38,749
No I didn't.

577
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:43,618
What's this?

578
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:46,322
Victim number three, Anita Barnes.

579
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:47,694
Sam, no.

580
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,892
It's okay. I don't know her.

581
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:53,095
This is business as usual.
I pop back and ID the perp.

582
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,338
You got to be kidding me.

583
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:58,170
I'm not letting you do this.

584
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:00,005
Every time you go back, people die.

585
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:01,442
Can't you learn that?

586
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:02,570
Police don't have any leads.

587
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:04,512
I'm the only one who can stop him.

588
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:07,142
Think this through, Sam.
How bad does it have to get?

589
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:09,345
I can fix this.

590
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:12,422
I'm not helping you this time.

591
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,566
Sam...

592
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:31,865
Oh, Goldburg says hi.

593
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:52,395
Okay, victim number three.

594
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:55,091
Anita Barnes.

595
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,793
September 5th, 2000.

596
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:59,335
5133 Millerton Street.

597
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:01,769
5133 Millerton.

598
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,899
5133 Millerton.

599
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,704
Anita Barnes, victim number three.

600
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:19,318
<i>Just watch. Just watch.</i>

601
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:22,416
<i>Just watch.</i>

602
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:59,694
Jesus.

603
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,925
She's my soul mate.

604
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:45,967
God.

605
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,851
Get up! Get the fuck up, bitch!

606
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:02,085
Nobody's going to hear you!

607
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:04,024
No!

608
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:05,561
No!

609
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:09,497
Shut the fuck up!
I swear I will fucking kill you!

610
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,728
Shut the fuck up!

611
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,929
Don't look at me! Don't look at me!
Don't look at me.

612
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,766
No!

613
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:19,674
You hear me? Do you hear me?
Do you fucking hear me?

614
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:23,270
- Say, "Yes, I hear you. Yes, I hear you."
- Yes! Yes!

615
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:24,905
I will fucking snap your neck!

616
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,041
Turn...

617
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:29,585
Shut up! Shut up!

618
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:32,213
Shut up! Shut up! You hear me?

619
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:35,520
Shut the fuck up! Open...

620
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:43,926
Oh, shit! I can't.

621
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,162
I can't.

622
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:50,268
I can't do this.

623
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:53,970
- I'm sorry.
- What?

624
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,280
I didn't even say the safe word.

625
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:01,512
- I can't do this.
- But you were doing great!

626
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:03,416
I know. It's just...

627
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:05,717
I can't get hard when you're screaming
and crying like that.

628
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:09,156
- It's upsetting. I just...
- You know I'm enjoying this!

629
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:10,853
I know. It's just...

630
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:13,590
<i>Cosmo said if we treat this
like a game, we can have fun with this.</i>

631
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:15,791
<i>I know what Cosmo says, okay?</i>

632
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,664
I can't do it. I mean,
we need to do something.

633
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:20,670
- Otherwise, how are we going to spice...
- I know.

634
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:23,229
You remind me all the time, okay?
But this shit is weird.

635
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:25,935
- It feels wrong.
- Why?

636
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:28,979
- Because I'm enjoying it.
- But I'm enjoying it, too.

637
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,911
I shouldn't enjoy raping you.
That's crazy.

638
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:32,915
You're completely overanalyzing this.

639
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:36,817
Okay, I know. Every time I
start thinking, I can't get hard.

640
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,787
It's, like, fucking up my vibe.

641
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:41,017
And now my mind's
racing a million mi...

642
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:42,615
I just...

643
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:44,251
You know what?

644
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:46,421
Don't worry. It's okay.

645
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:49,728
Just go get the accommodator.

646
00:42:57,374 --> 00:42:59,035
- What the fuck?
- I can explain this.

647
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:00,440
What are you doing in the closet,
you pervert?

648
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:02,911
- I'm the pervert?
- Yes, you...

649
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:08,009
<i>I want you out of here,
pendejo, or I'll call the cops.</i>

650
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,848
What the fuck you talking about, man?

651
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,581
You rent my couch, you pay me.

652
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,919
<i>You don't pay me, you find
somewhere else to sleep, pendejo.</i>

653
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:16,289
Fine, man. I'll be out of here.

654
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,658
Don't worry.

655
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:22,028
I'll be out of here next week
or the week before last.

656
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,624
Two days ago. Fuck you.

657
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:30,333
Goldburg, open up.

658
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:32,341
Goldburg, open up.

659
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:36,311
It's me, Sam.

660
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,371
Goldburg, open the door!

661
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,634
Goldburg, you in there?

662
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,301
Okay. Anita Barnes.

663
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:13,299
Funny.

664
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,549
Anita!

665
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:36,693
Excuse me.

666
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:39,996
I'm sorry.
Don't be scared, okay?

667
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,334
- Get away from me.
- I just need to ask you a few questions.

668
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,135
I have a restraining order against you.

669
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:46,073
- What?
- You're that perv from the closet!

670
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:48,873
Wait. No, listen.
I can explain that, okay?

671
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:51,540
I was trying to protect you,
and I think it worked.

672
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:53,708
But I need to figure out
why you're still alive.

673
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:56,116
Somebody please help!
Call the cops!

674
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:57,175
- Listen!
- Please help me!

675
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,051
Have you ever known somebody
named Lonnie Flennons?

676
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:00,147
- Please help!
- No, no, no!

677
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:01,953
It's okay. I know her.

678
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:06,219
Shit! Shit!

679
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,504
Sam, are you okay?

680
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:26,048
Yeah, I'm fine.

681
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:29,085
No, you're not. Look at you.

682
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:31,018
- Just pepper spray. I'm fine.
- What happened?

683
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,386
Nothing.

684
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,948
- Let me see.
- I'm fine!

685
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:42,926
Does the name Anita Barnes
mean anything to you?

686
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,434
You jumped without me.

687
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:49,438
Sam, do you know
how dangerous that is?

688
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:52,168
- You could drown. Your brain could boil.
- I can't just...

689
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:54,802
I don't need a lecture
from you right now, Jenna.

690
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:57,108
What I need to know...

691
00:46:57,181 --> 00:47:01,811
What I need to figure out
is why Anita Barnes is still alive.

692
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:04,115
I jumped. I did.

693
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:06,520
I went back, and I was supposed
to witness her murder.

694
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,524
She was victim number three
of the Pontiac Killer.

695
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:11,686
- Now I come back, and it's just...
- What?

696
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:16,825
Now I don't know. It's like all the
pieces of the puzzle just shifted around.

697
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,300
The only person who could
explain it to me is Goldburg,

698
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:21,098
and now he's disappeared.

699
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,503
Yeah, conveniently.

700
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,936
- What does that mean?
- Sam, he was going to

701
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:31,503
turn in evidence
linking you to the murders.

702
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:34,449
If you hadn't fast forwarded
through your past, you'd know that.

703
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,248
What are you talking about?

704
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:42,753
Sam, you trust me, don't you?

705
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:49,198
I mean, if you're doing this
for any reason,

706
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:51,530
I'd never turn you in.

707
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,307
This is ridiculous.

708
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:05,743
Sam, the night of the Brown murders,
I covered for you.

709
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:07,408
I know you weren't at home.

710
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:10,476
You know where I was!
I tried to save them!

711
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,988
Sam, you don't know
what happened two weeks ago.

712
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,819
Yeah, I know I didn't kill anybody.

713
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:18,157
Okay. Maybe not now, but...

714
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,321
what if with the jumping
you go crazy,

715
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:23,833
and sometime in the future...

716
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:30,206
Sam, you don't talk about it.

717
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:33,675
You don't talk about anything.
You just bottle it all up.

718
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:38,339
We've never even talked about
what happened in the fire.

719
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:46,749
Did you... Did you start the fire?

720
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:01,460
I saved your life, Jenna.

721
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:11,544
I saw you die.

722
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:18,577
I went to your funeral, for fuck's sake.

723
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,455
I don't want to hurt people, Jenna.

724
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:25,791
I don't do that. I help people.

725
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:28,626
You see? I-I help... I fix things.

726
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:31,930
It's what I do. That's what I did!
I went back, and I fixed it.

727
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:33,970
I fixed it, Jenna!

728
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:37,871
That's why you're here,
because I fix things!

729
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:40,171
You know, but sometimes
you can't fix everything.

730
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:42,734
Sometimes things
are just fucked, Jenna!

731
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:47,011
And... And right now,
things are kind of fucked!

732
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:48,381
So, I...

733
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,746
I'm try... I'm try...

734
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,814
- I'm trying to fix it, but it...
- Sam.

735
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:56,654
I just don't know why.

736
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:58,695
I'm too stupid or I'm too...
I'm too weak!

737
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:02,960
- It's... I... It's just...
- Sam. Sam.

738
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:05,194
It's going to be okay.

739
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:07,065
It's the jumping.

740
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:10,197
Just let the police
do their job for once.

741
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,110
Sam.

742
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:19,513
Promise me you're not
going to jump anymore.

743
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:29,517
Promise.

744
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:32,118
I can fix it, Jenna.

745
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:34,755
No.

746
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:24,378
Oh, thank you.

747
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:26,382
- Bye, guys.
- Night, Vicki.

748
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:27,576
See you later.

749
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:29,710
You ever wonder how
your life would be different

750
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:31,981
if you could go back
and change one thing?

751
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:33,886
Yeah. Everyone thinks about that.

752
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:35,185
Bye.

753
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:38,159
Hey, want to hear a joke?

754
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:39,786
Sure.

755
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:42,058
What do you get
when you mix a brown chicken

756
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:44,066
and a brown cow?

757
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:45,192
I don't know. What do you get?

758
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:47,532
Brown chicken, brown cow

759
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,999
It's funny, right?

760
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:56,171
Hey, Vicki,
you want to come over later?

761
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:02,909
Thanks for the offer,
but I got to get home to my man.

762
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:04,613
Right.

763
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:06,053
Yeah.

764
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:09,685
Maybe in another life.

765
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:11,624
Yeah. In another life.

766
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,099
Thank you.

767
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:22,604
- Bye, Sam.
- Bye.

768
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:25,834
Brown chicken, brown cow

769
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:01,677
We're closed!

770
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,951
Is there anyone in here?

771
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:48,647
Guess the engagement's off.

772
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,522
Is that all you found?

773
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:53,028
Forensics recovered a charred body

774
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:55,724
matching a description
at the Eastern body plant.

775
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:56,823
It's her.

776
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,959
Yep. Unless it was the last customer.

777
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:05,264
Good sauce.

778
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:21,951
Let's go over it again.

779
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:24,823
What time did you leave
the bar last night?

780
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:27,556
I don't know. I was drunk.

781
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:29,861
Your roommate says
you got in about 3.

782
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,299
The murders took place at 2:30 a.m.

783
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:35,532
How long is the walk
from the bar to your place?

784
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,197
About half an hour?

785
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:40,505
You really think I'm the Pontiac Killer?

786
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:42,977
You were a person of interest
in the Brown murders,

787
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:45,310
but you got off on your sister's alibi.

788
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:49,318
You showed up at Lonnie Flennons'
the day before he dies.

789
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:53,345
And now you just happen to be
at the bar the night

790
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:55,015
Vicki gets her last manicure.

791
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:58,390
Come on, Glenn.
Don't talk about her like that.

792
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,452
Don't be a pig.

793
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,300
Guess they need their privacy.

794
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,339
Now I'm going to tell you
how it's going to happen.

795
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:21,213
You're going to confess.

796
00:55:21,284 --> 00:55:22,876
You're going to plead insanity.

797
00:55:22,952 --> 00:55:26,251
I'm going to testify myself to what
a crazy motherfucker you are.

798
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:29,690
Because if you keep giving me
this tired-ass song and dance

799
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:32,250
about trying to stop the Pontiac Killer,

800
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:36,857
I'll make sure you're locked up in county
with them big old boys.

801
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:38,901
Now don't it just make
your asshole pucker?

802
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:40,435
Glenn.

803
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,336
The sister's here.
She's got a lawyer.

804
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:52,313
- So?
- She's got Boswich.

805
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:55,641
Jesus.

806
00:55:57,053 --> 00:55:58,782
Have you got enough for a conviction?

807
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,948
It's all circumstantial.

808
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,286
Now what?

809
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,293
Go back to the auto body plant.

810
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:06,292
Sweep for fingerprints.

811
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,955
See what else you can find.

812
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,022
- We were already there.
- Then look harder.

813
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,635
What are we going to do
about psychic boy?

814
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:16,638
What do you think?

815
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:19,573
- We have to let him walk.
- Put a tail on him.

816
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:28,682
The Tigers are looking good this year.

817
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:38,193
All right. They're letting him out.

818
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:44,231
Detective Glenn, we got a problem.

819
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:50,061
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, too.

820
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,506
- You okay?
- Yeah.

821
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:56,037
How was your night?

822
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,767
Eastern body plant.

823
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:34,141
This is where the police found
the Pontiac Killer's victims.

824
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:37,983
September 19, 2004.
September 19, 2004.

825
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:39,487
What do you want?

826
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:41,353
<i>I got to take a shit, pendejo.</i>

827
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:42,721
Five minutes.

828
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:47,319
I'm tired of your fucking "five minutes."

829
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:49,490
<i>And I know what pendejo means.</i>

830
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,625
Get the fuck out!

831
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:53,635
You don't pay rent, you leave.

832
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:55,728
I don't give a shit.

833
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:58,069
September 19, 2004.

834
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:05,578
<i>The old auto body plant where
the police find the victims.</i>

835
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,845
<i>They figured it out. When did
the Pontiac Killer start coming here?</i>

836
00:58:08,918 --> 00:58:10,818
<i>Why did he torture his victims?</i>

837
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:12,878
<i>I got to find him.</i>

838
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:14,480
<i>I want to see his face,
look into his eyes.</i>

839
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:16,218
<i>Look into his eyes.</i>

840
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:18,283
<i>I want to see his face,
look into his eyes.</i>

841
01:00:57,353 --> 01:00:59,344
Hey.

842
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:01,447
Don't sleep until noon today.

843
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:02,752
Jenna?

844
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,816
I'm leaving the classifieds
on the coffee table.

845
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:07,886
Maybe you can look and see
if there's a job in there for you.

846
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:10,398
Where you going?

847
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:14,062
Work. It's Monday.

848
01:01:14,137 --> 01:01:16,105
Oh, that's right.

849
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:18,367
Oh, uh, I'll be back at 6.

850
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:20,602
- You're going to cook dinner, right?
- I make dinner?

851
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,406
Hell, yeah.

852
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:24,343
And you said you were going to clean up.

853
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:28,248
This little project of yours
is starting to look kind of scary.

854
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:44,260
<i>The Pontiac Killer.
Eight victims, all women.</i>

855
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:46,528
<i>No, he killed Lonnie Flennons.
Seven victims.</i>

856
01:01:46,602 --> 01:01:47,933
<i>Seven women, one man.</i>

857
01:01:48,004 --> 01:01:49,904
<i>He hides their bodies.
Where does he take them?</i>

858
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:51,803
<i>The Eastern body plant.
Why does he take them there?</i>

859
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:54,638
<i>Some victims have signs of torture,
others killed immediately.</i>

860
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:57,077
<i>What's his pattern?
How does he get out undetected?</i>

861
01:01:57,146 --> 01:02:00,707
<i>Neighbors never hear him.
He must go at night... at night.</i>

862
01:02:00,783 --> 01:02:03,274
<i>Ah, does he live there?
Does he work nearby?</i>

863
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:06,617
<i>I've got to find him.
I've got to go back. I've got to go back.</i>

864
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:21,901
<i>What did these women
all have in common?</i>

865
01:02:21,971 --> 01:02:24,667
What's the...
What's the connection?

866
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:27,039
What's this guy about, huh?

867
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:29,010
Oh, man.

868
01:02:45,294 --> 01:02:48,752
Anita Barnes.
That's the one that's killing me.

869
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:51,095
Anita Barnes.

870
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:53,998
Let's see. There was...

871
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:56,038
Freeze, motherfucker!
Not a move! Not a fucking move!

872
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:58,903
- On your knees!
- On your fucking knees!

873
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,771
Move down! Get the fuck down!
Face down! Come on!

874
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:06,775
- Cuff him.
- Hands behind your back!

875
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:09,181
- Call them up.
- All right. Call it in.

876
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:20,952
Ouch.

877
01:03:26,569 --> 01:03:29,197
You really had this all mapped out.

878
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:32,139
Look at that.

879
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:37,573
You may be a nut job,
but you sure made this

880
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,842
a slam-dunk case for us.

881
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:44,348
I mean, your girlfriend,
Becky, cheats on you,

882
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:45,853
so you kill her.

883
01:03:45,922 --> 01:03:48,413
Then you kill her sister because...

884
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:51,289
I don't know... Bonus points?

885
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,852
Your pal Goldburg was going
to testify against you.

886
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:56,694
Then he disappears.

887
01:03:56,766 --> 01:03:59,200
And then you kill Lonnie Flennons.
I don't know.

888
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:00,929
- No, no. No.
- What?

889
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:03,631
Lonnie was going to be executed.
I had to go back.

890
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:05,401
What the fuck you talking about?
The next victim.

891
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:06,532
Which one?

892
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:10,845
- Anita Barnes.
- Who?

893
01:04:10,913 --> 01:04:12,710
Anita Barnes. Anita Barnes.

894
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:14,773
Did I... Did he...

895
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:17,945
- Did he kill Anita Barnes?
- I don't know. You tell me.

896
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:19,612
- Did I kill Anita Barnes?
- No. You tell me.

897
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,782
- When was the last Pontiac victim?
- Look, fuck-stick.

898
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:25,157
I'm asking the questions here.
How many did you kill?

899
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:34,467
I want my phone call.

900
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:38,896
I want my phone call.

901
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:52,211
Five minutes.

902
01:04:52,288 --> 01:04:54,518
You get one call, and you call me?

903
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,082
You trying to get me fired?

904
01:04:57,159 --> 01:05:00,253
Glenn, I got to get out of here.

905
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:03,261
Glenn, I'm serious, okay?

906
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:06,096
The killer is still out there,
and I'm the only one who can stop him.

907
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:08,398
According to
the joint police department,

908
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:10,302
the Pontiac Killer's right here.

909
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:12,170
Come on! You don't believe
it's me, Glenn!

910
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,903
I'm in enough trouble as it is, Sam!

911
01:05:16,979 --> 01:05:19,846
Okay, okay. Listen.

912
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,816
I'm not a psychic.

913
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:24,409
- I knew it.
- I time travel.

914
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:27,923
I can go back to wherever I was,
and I can watch.

915
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:31,323
And depending upon what happens,
I change things.

916
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:33,385
Usually on accident
but sometimes on purpose.

917
01:05:35,898 --> 01:05:37,991
Don't ever call me again.

918
01:05:38,067 --> 01:05:41,093
No, it's true! Glenn! Glenn!

919
01:05:42,471 --> 01:05:45,463
You met your wife
at Tiny Gasco's sweet-16 party!

920
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:49,272
Her dad got a taco cart
and a band for the neighborhood!

921
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:52,314
Your wife came up
and asked you to dance!

922
01:05:52,381 --> 01:05:55,043
But the first thing
she ever said to you was...

923
01:05:57,253 --> 01:05:59,244
Are you M.C. Hammer?

924
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:17,364
How did you know that?

925
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,499
I went back.

926
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:23,669
- I saw it.
- When?

927
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:26,237
Years ago, when you first
started asking me about...

928
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:29,113
I was saving it...

929
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:31,710
for something like this, actually.

930
01:06:31,787 --> 01:06:33,778
So what do you say, huh?

931
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:37,725
You'll help me out?

932
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:40,622
Please?

933
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:43,431
Hammer?

934
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:46,400
It's going down as a clerical error.
Glitch in the paperwork.

935
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:49,870
But it'll only buy you
a couple more hours.

936
01:06:49,939 --> 01:06:53,375
Once Nicholas finds out,
he'll bring you in.

937
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:55,933
There's no way he'll
let me see you again.

938
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,445
Come to think of it,

939
01:06:57,513 --> 01:06:59,777
I probably won't have a job
in a few hours.

940
01:07:05,254 --> 01:07:07,745
You catch that son of a bitch.

941
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:22,964
Jenna. Jenna!

942
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,769
Jenna, it's me! Come on!

943
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:28,002
Jenna, open up the door!
I'm going to kick it down!

944
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:30,045
You ain't kicking down
shit, motherfucker!

945
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:32,239
- Now you need to quiet your ass down!
- Open up!

946
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:34,305
What the hell's wrong with you?

947
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:36,283
Miss Davis, will you open
my sister's door for me?

948
01:07:36,352 --> 01:07:38,081
- I ain't opening up shit!
- Let me into her apartment.

949
01:07:38,154 --> 01:07:40,384
- I ain't gonna... Wait!
- You got the fucking keys!

950
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:43,619
- Where's your fucking key?
- Miss Davis, would you shut the fuck up?

951
01:07:43,692 --> 01:07:45,592
- You ain't about to get me!
- Let me into this apartment!

952
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:48,323
Don't put your hands
on me, motherfucker!

953
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:50,262
Don't make me have to cut you!

954
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:53,301
Shit! Too fucking old to go to prison.

955
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:56,202
You need to get your trifling ass in
and out of here as soon as possible!

956
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:58,638
- Thank you.
- Oh, kiss my ass!

957
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:00,231
Jenna?

958
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:25,333
"Favorite customer"?

959
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:30,636
<i>Hey, hey, hey, don't sniff that,</i>

960
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:34,164
unless you really want to lie on the
floor here paralyzed for the next hour.

961
01:10:08,337 --> 01:10:09,827
Goldburg!

962
01:10:11,907 --> 01:10:14,239
Goldburg, you in there?

963
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:16,301
Come on out here!

964
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:20,346
Come on out and face me, you son of a...

965
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:23,518
Come on!

966
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:44,005
Goldburg. What happened?

967
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:45,597
Hey, what happened?

968
01:10:47,543 --> 01:10:49,135
Goldburg, you're going
to be all right, okay?

969
01:10:49,211 --> 01:10:51,611
Can you stand up?
Can you stand up?

970
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,807
I'm going to get you some help.

971
01:10:53,882 --> 01:10:56,146
Okay? I'm going
to get you some help.

972
01:10:56,218 --> 01:10:57,947
I'm going to get you help.

973
01:10:58,020 --> 01:10:59,851
I'm going to get you help.

974
01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:37,691
Oh, my God. Oh, fuck.

975
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,529
Oh, my God.

976
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:51,538
Sammy.

977
01:11:51,607 --> 01:11:53,541
What are you doing here?

978
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:56,442
That thing is spring loaded.
Here. Let me get you out of there.

979
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:58,275
I'll get it.

980
01:11:58,347 --> 01:12:00,008
Here. Get up. Stand up.

981
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:01,674
We need to get you out of this thing.

982
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:03,843
I got you.

983
01:12:03,919 --> 01:12:06,012
Can you lean out?

984
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:12,661
Jenna, what are you doing here?

985
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:15,128
It's okay, Sam.

986
01:12:15,197 --> 01:12:17,392
Sam, I'll fix everything.

987
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:20,333
I'll just jump back, and I'll move the
trap out of the way. You'll be fine.

988
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:23,667
- You can jump?
- Yeah.

989
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:25,969
Surprise.

990
01:12:26,975 --> 01:12:30,376
Why are you...

991
01:12:30,446 --> 01:12:32,607
What are you doing here?

992
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:34,740
You don't realize this,

993
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:39,311
but I've explained this to you,
like, a zillion times.

994
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:41,481
It's really frustrating.

995
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:46,861
You fell in love with that whore, Sam.

996
01:12:47,896 --> 01:12:49,761
She didn't love you.

997
01:12:49,832 --> 01:12:51,663
She was cheating on you.

998
01:12:51,734 --> 01:12:53,224
What... What whore?

999
01:12:53,302 --> 01:12:55,293
Rebecca Brown.

1000
01:12:56,705 --> 01:12:58,969
Jesus, Sam. Keep up.

1001
01:13:00,008 --> 01:13:03,341
No. No. Oh, my God.

1002
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:09,240
I took care of it,
and everything worked out fine.

1003
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:11,582
I even got back at Lonnie Flennons
for hurting you.

1004
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:18,790
But then Rebecca Brown's
stupid sister comes over,

1005
01:13:18,861 --> 01:13:22,922
and... and you decide
to break the rules, Sam.

1006
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:25,728
I told you not to do it.
I told you it would be bad.

1007
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:27,291
You followed me back?

1008
01:13:33,609 --> 01:13:36,100
Jenna, what about the...
What about the other girls?

1009
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:37,770
What about the...
You didn't know them.

1010
01:13:37,846 --> 01:13:39,939
They were strangers.
What did they ever do to you?

1011
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:42,916
Can't you see, Sam?

1012
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:44,919
They were only strangers

1013
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:47,455
'cause I stopped them
before you met them.

1014
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:52,453
Anita Barnes.

1015
01:13:52,528 --> 01:13:55,793
She was the whore
you went to Chicago with.

1016
01:13:55,864 --> 01:13:57,729
I couldn't let you leave me, Sam.

1017
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:02,029
And then Vicki.

1018
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:05,403
You kept her a secret from me,
too, but I found out.

1019
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:10,511
She wasn't a lady, Sam.

1020
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:13,446
None of them were ladies.

1021
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:17,417
Jenna, they... they're the women
I would've fallen in love with.

1022
01:14:17,486 --> 01:14:19,977
I would've... I would've
had a family, a life.

1023
01:14:20,055 --> 01:14:22,819
Don't you see I did it all for you?

1024
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:24,483
You understand that, don't you?

1025
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,028
Why did you torture them?
You mutilated them!

1026
01:14:27,095 --> 01:14:30,531
- You cut them to pieces!
- I didn't torture them! They tortured me!

1027
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:33,500
Every single one of them.

1028
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:39,306
What about Goldburg?

1029
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,775
He was catching on.

1030
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:45,905
I had to shut him up.

1031
01:14:48,016 --> 01:14:50,541
<i>This is so Scooby-Doo, isn't it?</i>

1032
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:53,312
I would've gotten away with it

1033
01:14:53,388 --> 01:14:56,255
if it wasn't for those meddling kids.

1034
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:57,815
You're out of your fucking mind, Jenna.

1035
01:14:57,893 --> 01:15:00,487
Come on, Sam.

1036
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:02,553
You know that's not true.

1037
01:15:04,766 --> 01:15:07,291
If you hadn't kept jumping back
to catch me,

1038
01:15:07,369 --> 01:15:09,234
I could've stopped.

1039
01:15:09,304 --> 01:15:11,363
But every time you went back,
there was more witnesses,

1040
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,431
there was more evidence to cover up.

1041
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:16,910
It's funny when you think about it.

1042
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:19,072
You really did create a serial killer.

1043
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:24,278
Ever since the day
you jumped back and you saved me,

1044
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:25,945
I knew I'd only live for you.

1045
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:28,922
No, Jenna. Jenna.

1046
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:37,565
Sam...

1047
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:42,064
do you love me like I love you?

1048
01:15:45,674 --> 01:15:48,837
It's okay.
Forget about everything else.

1049
01:15:48,911 --> 01:15:52,108
This is the moment we've waited for
our whole lives.

1050
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:57,917
Jenna! What are you doing?

1051
01:15:57,986 --> 01:16:00,648
Sam, we're not like other people.

1052
01:16:01,857 --> 01:16:04,451
Their rules don't apply to us.

1053
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:10,487
No, Jenna! You're... Oh, my God.

1054
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:13,364
Sam, I love you more than anything
in the whole world, Sam.

1055
01:16:13,435 --> 01:16:14,629
- Oh, my God.
- It's okay.

1056
01:16:14,703 --> 01:16:17,137
It's just you and me
like it's meant to be.

1057
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:19,366
- No. No. No.
- It's okay.

1058
01:16:20,776 --> 01:16:23,711
It's okay. Sam?

1059
01:16:23,779 --> 01:16:26,714
What's wrong? What's wrong?
What's going on?

1060
01:16:26,782 --> 01:16:28,477
Sam, are you okay?

1061
01:16:30,118 --> 01:16:31,551
Sam, are you jumping?

1062
01:16:33,188 --> 01:16:34,746
Sam, what's going on?

1063
01:16:34,823 --> 01:16:36,586
Tell me what's happening.

1064
01:16:36,658 --> 01:16:38,956
Sam, don't jump!

1065
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:41,757
Where are you going? Sam!

1066
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:45,025
Sam, don't you leave me.

1067
01:16:54,977 --> 01:16:57,070
Sam, where's Jenna?

1068
01:16:57,145 --> 01:16:59,136
You go take care of Mom,
and I'll get her.

1069
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:04,548
Sam, help me!

1070
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,611
Sam, let me out!

1071
01:17:06,688 --> 01:17:09,122
Let me out! Please let me out!

1072
01:17:09,191 --> 01:17:12,183
What are you doing? Sam!

1073
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:14,524
Sam, stop! What are you doing?

1074
01:17:14,596 --> 01:17:15,858
- Jenna!
- Sam!

1075
01:17:19,768 --> 01:17:21,360
- Sam!
- Listen to me!

1076
01:17:24,573 --> 01:17:27,701
- Why are you doing this?
- I'm your brother, Jenna.

1077
01:17:27,776 --> 01:17:30,677
- I'll always love you!
- Sam! Sam, what are you doing?

1078
01:17:30,746 --> 01:17:33,010
- There's no other way!
- Sam!

1079
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:34,810
Sam, let me out!

1080
01:17:34,883 --> 01:17:37,875
Sam, let me out!

1081
01:17:44,026 --> 01:17:46,324
I'm sorry, Jenna!

1082
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:09,578
Where's Jenna, Sam?

1083
01:18:09,651 --> 01:18:12,211
Where's Jenna?

1084
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:42,845
Good morning, dork-face.

1085
01:18:42,918 --> 01:18:44,977
Did you sleep well?

1086
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:46,987
You must've had some kind of dream

1087
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:49,580
because you were snoring away.

1088
01:18:49,658 --> 01:18:52,388
- Are we there yet?
- Yes, Jenna, we're there.

1089
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:54,053
Jenna?

1090
01:18:54,129 --> 01:18:55,960
What, Daddy?

1091
01:18:57,099 --> 01:18:59,693
Come on.

1092
01:19:03,205 --> 01:19:04,672
How the burgers coming?

1093
01:19:12,814 --> 01:19:14,577
- Here they are.
- Hey.

1094
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:16,879
Late for your own birthday party.

1095
01:19:16,952 --> 01:19:19,546
Hello, sweetheart.

1096
01:19:19,621 --> 01:19:21,521
- Happy Birthday.
- Hey!

1097
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:23,114
What?

1098
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:25,887
What do you want?
Burgers? Hot dogs? What?

1099
01:19:25,961 --> 01:19:27,895
- Whatever you're cooking. Throw it on.
- Start with a beer?

1100
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:29,624
- Yeah, sure. Hey!
- Happy Birthday.

1101
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:32,258
Hey, Jenna.

1102
01:19:32,334 --> 01:19:34,894
- How are you?
- I'm good. I'm good.

1103
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:36,301
Hey.

1104
01:19:36,371 --> 01:19:38,168
How are you, hon?

1105
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,003
- Great.
- My son!

1106
01:19:41,209 --> 01:19:43,177
How are you? Oh, good to see you.

1107
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:44,610
Howdy, ma'am.

1108
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:47,842
I bet you got a story or two
for us, don't you?

1109
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:52,886
Oh, man!

1110
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:54,785
Here you go.

1111
01:19:56,892 --> 01:19:58,052
Thank you.

1112
01:19:58,126 --> 01:19:59,855
- Hey, Happy Birthday.
- Hey!

1113
01:19:59,928 --> 01:20:02,863
- Oh, my God!
- It's good to see you.

1114
01:20:08,336 --> 01:20:10,270
Get Janice another beer.

1115
01:20:11,270 --> 01:30:28,896
