1
00:00:57,382 --> 00:00:59,612
<i>Hey, this is Tris.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

2
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:06,017
Hey, Tris, it's Nick. How are you?
It's about 3 in the afternoon.

3
00:01:06,258 --> 00:01:08,488
I think you're probably
still at school.

4
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,587
I stayed home today.
I took a personal day.

5
00:01:12,797 --> 00:01:14,890
I wanted to finish up
some creative projects...

6
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,558
...and stuff that I've been working on
around here.

7
00:01:23,074 --> 00:01:25,167
Nothing to do with you or anything.

8
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:30,606
So I'm sorry, real sorry I missed you.
I was hoping to get you on the phone.

9
00:01:31,616 --> 00:01:33,777
Haven't talked to you in a while...

10
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,654
...and I just kind of wanted to
speak to you at some point.

11
00:01:39,524 --> 00:01:41,321
You know, I think last time
we spoke...

12
00:01:41,526 --> 00:01:45,292
...we both kind of said some really
nasty things that neither of us meant.

13
00:01:45,497 --> 00:01:47,522
You know, just, like...

14
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:50,297
...when you broke up with me,
you know...

15
00:01:50,502 --> 00:01:52,493
...and everything, on my b-day.

16
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,211
Also, that mixed CD
that I left on your doorstep...

17
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:09,251
...was the last one
that I'll be making for you.

18
00:02:11,122 --> 00:02:13,147
More or less.

19
00:02:14,225 --> 00:02:15,954
Anyway, give me a call.

20
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:18,391
I'm doing very well.
I hope you're great.

21
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,996
Have a great weekend,
and do something fun, you know.

22
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:23,133
Just get out there.

23
00:02:23,335 --> 00:02:25,462
Call me, though,
when you get a chance.

24
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,501
All right. Bye.

25
00:02:27,706 --> 00:02:28,934
<i>Message has been deleted.</i>

26
00:02:29,574 --> 00:02:30,563
Fuck.

27

<i>To re-record

28
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,047
Norah.

29
00:03:17,088 --> 00:03:18,419
Norah.

30
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,580
It's Friday, pumpkin.

31
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:22,521
I'm sorry. Do you mind?
I'm in my zone.

32
00:03:22,727 --> 00:03:24,558
- Oh, you're in your zone. I'm so...
- What?

33
00:03:24,763 --> 00:03:25,752
- What?
- What?

34
00:03:25,964 --> 00:03:26,953
What? What? What?

35
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,723
Could you please
come join my zone?

36
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:29,957
Hey, guys.

37
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,465
- Hi.
- Hey, Tris.

38
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:32,931
He made another one.

39
00:03:33,638 --> 00:03:35,503
Look at the ridiculous cover art.

40
00:03:37,242 --> 00:03:38,231
I...

41
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,138
Don't.

42
00:03:41,946 --> 00:03:43,436
- Don't do it.
- Don't do what?

43
00:03:43,648 --> 00:03:45,309
Let's go already.

44
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:48,748
He makes the best mixes in the world.
Look at this cover art.

45
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,652
Tris does not know
what she gave up.

46
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,948
<i>"Road to Closure Volume 12"?
Poor bastard.</i>

47
00:03:56,161 --> 00:03:58,789
You are so in love with this guy
it is ridiculous.

48
00:03:58,997 --> 00:04:01,488
Okay, I have never met him.
I have no idea who he is.

49
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,326
I'm just gonna put this in my iPod.

50
00:04:26,491 --> 00:04:28,482
Is that always there?

51
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,518
Yes, always.

52
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:31,888
Sorry.

53
00:04:32,097 --> 00:04:33,997
That's where we put the garbage.

54
00:04:39,537 --> 00:04:40,526
Yo.

55
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,035
- Yo.
- I'm not going.

56
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,970
- What do you mean you're not going?
- Let's load the van.

57
00:04:45,176 --> 00:04:47,406
I don't wanna go.
I'm taking a mental-health day.

58
00:04:47,612 --> 00:04:49,978
We have a gig, Nicky.
This is a big night for us.

59
00:04:50,181 --> 00:04:52,046
This is our first night
with our new name.

60
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,185
We are the Jerk Offs,
and we finally found a drummer.

61
00:04:55,386 --> 00:04:57,411
You found a drummer? Who?

62
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,150
That's a children's toy.
Who's gonna operate that thing?

63
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:03,486
- You.
- Okay. Thanks for coming by, guys.

64
00:05:03,995 --> 00:05:04,984
Nicky.

65
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,519
We love you, okay...

66
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:09,495
...but you've been depressed
for a month and it's not cool.

67
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:11,760
Get your clothes.
We're gonna play this gig...

68
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,528
...then find you something better.

69
00:05:13,738 --> 00:05:15,729
- Someone better.
- Yes.

70
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,239
Not that easy. You don't know
what it's like to be straight. It's awful.

71
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,309
<i>- Jersey's only source for indie rock.</i>

72
00:05:21,513 --> 00:05:23,811
<i>And for all of you
Where's Fluffy fans out there...</i>

73
00:05:24,015 --> 00:05:27,542
<i>...for the first time since the last time,
looks like Fluffy's to be found...</i>

74
00:05:27,752 --> 00:05:30,220
<i>...somewhere in the five boroughs
tonight.</i>

75
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:33,185
<i>The rarest show on Earth

76
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:35,450
<i>...so keep an eye out
for those white rabbits.</i>

77
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,855
<i>You never know
where they might lead you.</i>

78
00:05:39,097 --> 00:05:40,962
Fluffy. You can't say no to Fluffy.

79
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,031
- Okay, all right. I'll go.
- Yes.

80
00:05:43,234 --> 00:05:45,464
- Let me put some clothes on.
- Put some clothes on.

81
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,071
- But I'm taking my own car.
- And put on some pants.

82
00:05:50,341 --> 00:05:51,899
- Oh, my God.
- What?

83
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,099
Okay.

84
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,745
I just got a text from Carrie
saying Where's Fluffy...

85
00:05:55,947 --> 00:05:59,075
...is doing a surprise show tonight.
- Oh, my God.

86
00:05:59,284 --> 00:06:02,617
Last time they had a surprise show
it was at Arlene's. Start there.

87
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,082
Okay, wait.

88
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:08,055
Promise me that you won't get drunk
and leave me alone the whole night.

89
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:10,523
When have I ever done that?
I promise.

90
00:06:10,728 --> 00:06:11,888
Caroline.

91
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:16,055
Did you hear? Who's Fluffy is playing
in the city tonight. I love that band.

92
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:18,735
It's "Where's Fluffy. "

93
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,768
Whatever. So I'm bringing this guy.

94
00:06:21,973 --> 00:06:24,203
He's been following me around
the mall for months.

95
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:27,003
- Maybe it's your scent.
- Yeah, what's that called?

96
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:28,804
"I Cheat on People"
by Calvin Klein?

97
00:06:29,314 --> 00:06:31,578
And what do you wear?
"My Daddy's Famous" by Dior?

98
00:06:31,783 --> 00:06:36,243
- All right, you're both pretty.
- I was only kidding. So sensitive.

99
00:06:38,056 --> 00:06:39,819
Okay, talk to you later.

100
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,184
Bye.

101
00:06:41,392 --> 00:06:43,360
- Why do you humor her?
- She's not that bad.

102
00:06:43,561 --> 00:06:46,792
We grew up with her.
Just don't let it ruin your night.

103
00:06:46,998 --> 00:06:48,158
Fluffy.

104
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,300
- Fluffy. Fluffy.
- Fluffy. Fluffy.

105
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,365
Goddamn it. Come on.

106
00:07:36,614 --> 00:07:37,774
Cheers.

107
00:07:37,982 --> 00:07:41,383
- Hey, baby, you look good.
- No, you look good, baby.

108
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:21,809
- Give it.
- It's mine.

109
00:09:40,338 --> 00:09:42,272
We are the Jerk Offs.

110
00:09:47,512 --> 00:09:49,707
Nick, the drum machine. Turn it off.

111
00:09:51,349 --> 00:09:53,681
I don't know how this works.
There's no off button.

112
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,318
You suck!

113
00:09:56,821 --> 00:09:58,652
Drum machines suck.

114
00:10:00,525 --> 00:10:02,925
Your mother buy that for you?

115
00:10:04,595 --> 00:10:08,497
- Oh, my God, you dirty little slut.
- What? What did I...?

116
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:10,758
You're practically blowing him
with your eyes.

117
00:10:10,968 --> 00:10:15,905
I am not. You cannot do anybody
with your eyes, Caroline.

118
00:10:16,107 --> 00:10:19,474
Well, you can. But whatever.
He's a complete mo, look at him.

119
00:10:19,677 --> 00:10:22,510
He is not a mo.
Look at how shitty he's dressed.

120
00:10:22,713 --> 00:10:24,647
- His Supercuts haircut. He's coming.
- I know.

121
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,984
Sorry. I'm sorry.

122
00:10:29,987 --> 00:10:30,976
That was really good.

123
00:10:31,189 --> 00:10:33,214
Well, he's bridge-and-tunnel,
obviously.

124
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,915
If he's bridge-and-tunnel,
then what does that make us?

125
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,095
Doesn't make us anything.
You're very drunk. Come on, let's go.

126
00:10:39,297 --> 00:10:42,266
Whatever, you're drunk.
Why don't you cut the cord, Mom?

127
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:44,862
Hi.

128
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,701
- God.
- Hi, I've been looking at you guys.

129
00:10:48,906 --> 00:10:51,431
Have you been looking at me?

130
00:10:54,312 --> 00:10:55,336
Hey, Nicky.

131
00:10:55,913 --> 00:10:58,541
Ask this beefy guy
what his name is for me.

132
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:02,352
- What's your name?
- Anything you want it to be.

133
00:11:05,056 --> 00:11:07,581
- He's creepy.
- He's harmless.

134
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,317
And he's gonna help us find Fluffy.

135
00:11:11,095 --> 00:11:12,357
What's your problem?

136
00:11:12,864 --> 00:11:14,195
She's here.

137
00:11:14,565 --> 00:11:16,396
You told her
not to come to the shows.

138
00:11:16,601 --> 00:11:18,034
I did. She came anyway.

139
00:11:18,236 --> 00:11:20,033
Don't even think
about going over there.

140
00:11:20,238 --> 00:11:22,763
I need to say hi if she came
all this way to see me.

141
00:11:23,207 --> 00:11:26,699
Dude, don't give into temptation.
She's not worth it.

142
00:11:52,937 --> 00:11:55,337
Oh, my God. I love it.

143
00:11:55,706 --> 00:11:58,607
- Happy anniversary.
- Thank you so much.

144
00:11:59,477 --> 00:12:02,810
- Oh, my God, all right, how's it look?
- Fits great. It looks really good.

145
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:05,005
Is it too long in the back?

146
00:12:07,418 --> 00:12:08,851
No.

147
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,846
So you like it?

148
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,448
Yeah.

149
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,519
- Come here.
- Good.

150
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,898
- Who do you belong to?
- Tris. Tris.

151
00:12:21,098 --> 00:12:24,932
No, no, louder. Who do you belong to?
I didn't hear you. I didn't hear you.

152
00:12:30,408 --> 00:12:31,636
Norah.

153
00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:33,035
Alone again?

154
00:12:33,444 --> 00:12:36,174
Hey, Tris.
Been looking for you everywhere.

155
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,680
This is the one I was telling you about.
You have friends who'd be into her?

156
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,877
You know what, that's okay.
Thanks, anyway.

157
00:12:44,088 --> 00:12:45,953
Oh, well, you know,
Gary's in college.

158
00:12:46,157 --> 00:12:48,523
You could have better luck
with college guys.

159
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:52,719
That's when guys really get into stuff
like how smart a girl is, you know?

160
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,659
It's not all about looks.

161
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:58,294
Yeah. Gary seems real deep.

162
00:13:00,171 --> 00:13:03,732
But I guess Ira Silverberg's daughter
doesn't have to worry about looks.

163
00:13:07,044 --> 00:13:10,036
- I came here with someone, actually.
- Really?

164
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,738
- Yep.
- Who?

165
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,349
My boyfriend.

166
00:13:14,552 --> 00:13:16,019
Your boyfriend?

167
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,209
Yeah.

168
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,480
Guess you should be getting
back to him, then.

169
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:20,816
Yeah.

170
00:13:24,161 --> 00:13:27,358
Okay. I'm gonna go see him, then.

171
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:39,601
Hi.

172
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,269
I know this is gonna sound weird,
and I'm a stranger...

173
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:45,881
...but would you be my boyfriend
for five minutes?

174
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,072
What?

175
00:13:50,554 --> 00:13:51,816
Him?

176
00:13:53,257 --> 00:13:54,849
Okay, just be cool. Just be cool.

177
00:13:55,426 --> 00:13:57,087
Just, please, just go with it, okay?

178
00:14:15,913 --> 00:14:17,744
Nick. Norah.

179
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,316
How do you guys, like,
know each other?

180
00:14:20,518 --> 00:14:21,815
What?

181
00:14:23,854 --> 00:14:29,656
We go to the same dentist together.

182
00:14:30,928 --> 00:14:32,395
Dr. Mann.

183
00:14:33,264 --> 00:14:35,732
<i>Manno Mannowitz.</i>

184
00:14:37,868 --> 00:14:39,426
Come on, Gary.

185
00:14:41,739 --> 00:14:43,104
Hey, did you get my mixes?

186
00:14:45,376 --> 00:14:46,434
How do you know Tris?

187
00:14:47,144 --> 00:14:50,307
Mixes? Are you Tris' Nick?

188
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:53,415
She told you about me?
How do you know her?

189
00:14:53,617 --> 00:14:55,107
Oh, dear God.

190
00:14:57,288 --> 00:14:59,051
Go.

191
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:04,592
That tastes so good.

192
00:15:05,796 --> 00:15:08,594
Help, help, help. I just made out
with Tris' sloppy seconds.

193
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,460
What's the problem now?

194
00:15:10,668 --> 00:15:14,365
Caroline, the problem is that this is not
gonna compete with perfect little that.

195
00:15:14,572 --> 00:15:16,699
Okay? It's time to go. Night is over.

196
00:15:16,907 --> 00:15:18,602
- I fell.
- I know you fell.

197
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:20,333
Let me give you a hand with that.

198
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,069
- I gotta get her home.
- Are you going back to Englewood?

199
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,738
- I can take you. That where you live?
- Do I look like I'm from Englewood?

200
00:15:26,951 --> 00:15:30,182
I don't know if you're saying
that you are from there or you're not.

201
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:33,322
That's one super cut
you got there, dude.

202
00:15:33,524 --> 00:15:35,082
- Think she's drunk.
- Oh, yeah.

203
00:15:35,292 --> 00:15:38,318
I'm just parked right out front.
I think we can walk her out there.

204
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:41,157
- Wait. Stop.
- What?

205
00:15:41,365 --> 00:15:43,890
- Are you mad at me?
- No, Caroline.

206
00:15:44,101 --> 00:15:46,592
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

207
00:15:46,804 --> 00:15:48,294
Hi.

208
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,062
Hi.

209
00:15:50,274 --> 00:15:52,071
Hi, we're Bishop Allen.

210
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:05,348
- Try to walk. Focus on walking.
- Hi, guys. So look, I need you.

211
00:16:06,157 --> 00:16:07,647
What?

212
00:16:08,058 --> 00:16:09,423
Can we get a ride?

213
00:16:10,027 --> 00:16:14,760
Who...? We? Is that...? Are you...?
You and this fellow here? Is that "we"?

214
00:16:15,232 --> 00:16:17,928
- Well...
- Sorry, Tris, the car's full.

215
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:22,500
You didn't say "hi" to me earlier.
Are you mad at me?

216
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,908
I think you should probably
take Drunkzilla here...

217
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,044
...back to Daddy's house anyway,
don't you?

218
00:16:28,245 --> 00:16:30,406
And I was just talking to Nick, so...

219
00:16:31,315 --> 00:16:35,775
You know what, Tris? There's no room
for you, okay? Not tonight. Come on.

220
00:16:37,655 --> 00:16:41,091
Well, that's cool. I'll catch up with
you guys. It's a small car, anyway.

221
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,759
You guys have fun.

222
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,520
Not now, Gary.

223
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,308
Sorry.

224
00:17:08,552 --> 00:17:09,883
Give me a minute.

225
00:17:12,056 --> 00:17:13,717
Damn it. Why won't she turn?

226
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,761
- I think it's gotta cool down.
- Yugo.

227
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,392
Yeah, you don't see many of these
Easter eggs on the road.

228
00:17:26,604 --> 00:17:28,731
Yeah. Once you buy one
you see them everywhere.

229
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:32,705
Oh, yeah? It's pretty small.
In mint condition, though.

230
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:36,573
Yeah. This is the result of a lot
of time and care.

231
00:17:37,615 --> 00:17:38,604
Unfortunately.

232
00:17:41,986 --> 00:17:44,352
- You off-duty?
- This isn't a cab.

233
00:17:44,555 --> 00:17:45,544
Are you off-duty?

234
00:17:45,756 --> 00:17:47,621
It's not a cab, my friend, I promise you.

235
00:17:47,825 --> 00:17:49,122
Okay, don't get mad.

236
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,419
I wasn't getting mad.

237
00:17:57,234 --> 00:17:58,462
What is that?

238
00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:01,035
It's not as ominous as it seems.

239
00:18:01,238 --> 00:18:02,933
I told you they look cute together.

240
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:06,102
Okay, here's the plan.
I'm gonna go give Nicky a pep talk.

241
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,778
Dev, clean up the girl.

242
00:18:09,747 --> 00:18:12,181
Nick. I had a feeling
you two might get stuck.

243
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:15,352
- Having some trouble?
- Stalled again?

244
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:18,180
Hi, Thom. Hi, beefy guy.

245
00:18:19,657 --> 00:18:21,124
- Lady friend.
- Yes?

246
00:18:21,325 --> 00:18:24,488
Dev could use your assistance
in the van, if you please. Thank you.

247
00:18:24,695 --> 00:18:25,821
In the van?

248
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:29,830
In the van. Large vehicle right there?
Yes, thank you. Thank you.

249
00:18:39,043 --> 00:18:40,408
Hi.

250
00:18:40,611 --> 00:18:41,635
Try this.

251
00:18:42,613 --> 00:18:43,671
What?

252
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:46,247
Let's just say we're not the biggest
fans of his ex.

253
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,180
And we've decided
you're to be his salvation.

254
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,554
Besides, we saw you two making out,
and we think you're the one.

255
00:18:56,126 --> 00:18:58,219
We just gotta get you
out of that sports bra.

256
00:18:58,896 --> 00:19:03,333
- This isn't a sports bra.
- Come on. We're all ladies here.

257
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:07,196
<i>Are you seriously
talking about Tris right now?</i>

258
00:19:07,404 --> 00:19:10,601
I think this might be my opportunity
to get some answers, you know?

259
00:19:10,808 --> 00:19:13,572
Do not talk to this girl
about Tris, Nicky. I mean it.

260
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,745
Look, we'll take
the drunk mess home.

261
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:19,211
You kids go find Fluffy, text us
when you do and we'll meet you there.

262
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,008
What could possibly go wrong?

263
00:19:24,722 --> 00:19:25,882
Okay.

264
00:19:28,425 --> 00:19:30,518
Oh, it's better than the uni-boob.

265
00:19:35,199 --> 00:19:36,188
Thanks a lot.

266
00:19:37,735 --> 00:19:40,033
This isn't gonna work, okay?
He's hung up on Tris.

267
00:19:40,237 --> 00:19:42,467
You look gorgeous.
And let me tell you something:

268
00:19:42,673 --> 00:19:47,235
Nicky is definitely worth the underwire.
He just needs a little push, that's all.

269
00:19:54,084 --> 00:19:55,278
Shit.

270
00:19:56,253 --> 00:19:58,153
Oh, God. I gotta get my friend home.

271
00:19:58,355 --> 00:19:59,788
- We'll do it.
- What?

272
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,323
We'll do it. Go find Fluffy.

273
00:20:03,527 --> 00:20:04,960
Go.

274
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,756
- Hey, unlock the door, please.
- Hi, hello?

275
00:20:07,965 --> 00:20:11,594
Caroline? Honey, can you hear me?

276
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,295
Aren't you a sweet thing?

277
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,939
- Wake up, Caroline.
- Wake up.

278
00:20:17,141 --> 00:20:18,608
- Wake up, Caroline.
- Get out.

279
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:21,573
Please be careful. This is not a toy.

280
00:20:21,945 --> 00:20:25,608
- Can you...?
- You just need to be quiet.

281
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:45,135
Unlock the door, bitch.

282
00:20:45,335 --> 00:20:47,200
Please don't be mad at me.
I'm right here.

283
00:20:47,404 --> 00:20:50,771
Caroline. Just like we practiced.
Go like this.

284
00:20:50,974 --> 00:20:52,339
I'm right here.

285
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:55,478
- You don't have to yell at me.
- Go like that. Up, up a little.

286
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:56,868
- Yes.
- Yeah.

287
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:01,715
- Everybody, move along. Thank you.
- I got her.

288
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,344
- All right.
- I did it.

289
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,490
- I can see the head.
- Come with me. Come with me.

290
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:12,392
I got her.

291
00:21:12,596 --> 00:21:14,154
Okay. Nobody look.

292
00:21:14,364 --> 00:21:15,353
I got her.

293
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,330
If you touch one hair on her head,
I will kill all of you.

294
00:21:18,535 --> 00:21:22,562
Norah, I'm being carried.
You look so...

295
00:21:23,507 --> 00:21:24,565
She'll be okay.

296
00:21:24,775 --> 00:21:26,140
Is she conscious?

297
00:21:26,844 --> 00:21:29,574
She'll be okay.
They're not gonna kill her.

298
00:21:31,381 --> 00:21:32,814
Eyes up here.

299
00:21:53,904 --> 00:21:55,701
So where do you think Fluffy's
gonna be?

300
00:21:55,906 --> 00:21:58,704
- Should we try Mercury Lounge?
- Yeah, that's good.

301
00:21:58,909 --> 00:22:01,673
But you know Fluffy's not going on
till super late, though.

302
00:22:01,879 --> 00:22:04,848
So I guess we have some time
to kill, then.

303
00:22:15,492 --> 00:22:17,221
So...

304
00:22:17,728 --> 00:22:19,958
...your friends are all gay, right?

305
00:22:20,697 --> 00:22:21,686
Not all my friends.

306
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,961
Not all your friends,
but the ones in the van are gay?

307
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:27,694
Yeah, I mean, they're all gay. Yeah.

308
00:22:27,905 --> 00:22:32,365
One hundred percent, you know, gay.
Gay every day, all the time.

309
00:22:32,576 --> 00:22:34,407
Okay. That's a relief.

310
00:22:34,611 --> 00:22:38,240
If anyone's gonna get raped
in that van, it will be a guy.

311
00:22:38,782 --> 00:22:39,942
That's good.

312
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,976
You wanna get a drink or something?

313
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,116
- I don't drink at all.
- I don't either.

314
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,689
You don't?
Are you straightedge like I am?

315
00:22:48,892 --> 00:22:51,827
I don't really subscribe to any label.

316
00:22:57,067 --> 00:22:58,728
Fine.

317
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,498
Hey. What's that banging?

318
00:23:06,376 --> 00:23:10,779
- Is it my car?
- I think it's drums. Get it?

319
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:14,112
Get it? Rhythm?
Rhythmic drumming on drums?

320
00:23:14,318 --> 00:23:16,377
Because when you're in a band,
you need drums.

321
00:23:16,587 --> 00:23:18,680
And you're in a band,
and you don't have drums.

322
00:23:19,957 --> 00:23:21,015
Thanks.

323
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:24,957
I haven't heard that before.

324
00:23:25,495 --> 00:23:28,658
I didn't mean your band wasn't good.
I just meant you need a drummer.

325
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:31,459
You can just drop me off up here
if you want.

326
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,428
- Yo. Yo.
- Oh, my God.

327
00:23:35,639 --> 00:23:37,129
Taxi. Yeah.

328
00:23:38,175 --> 00:23:41,110
- Hi.
- Hey. Bowery Ballroom.

329
00:23:41,311 --> 00:23:44,109
No, I'm not a cab, sir.
I'm not a cab. I'm not a cab.

330
00:23:45,082 --> 00:23:47,312
- It's so good to be alone.
- Finally.

331
00:23:48,318 --> 00:23:51,185
- Bowery Ballroom?
- You made that happen.

332
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,754
Oh, God, yeah,
that's what I'm talking about.

333
00:23:53,957 --> 00:23:56,289
- I do that?
- Yeah, you do that.

334
00:24:14,111 --> 00:24:17,308
- So are you from Englewood?
- Yep.

335
00:24:17,881 --> 00:24:20,076
Englewood, up to no good.

336
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:26,419
- I'm from Hoboken.
- Hoboken, no joking. What?

337
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,320
- I love you.
- I love you.

338
00:24:30,527 --> 00:24:32,495
I love you so much it's retarded.

339
00:24:35,565 --> 00:24:37,533
So are you going off to college?

340
00:24:38,201 --> 00:24:39,327
You smell so good.

341
00:24:39,536 --> 00:24:42,869
- I don't know. I got into Brown.
- Oh, you smell like soap.

342
00:24:43,073 --> 00:24:46,338
But I have this job lined up here
which is...

343
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:49,075
I don't know,
and I have to make up my mind fast...

344
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,407
...because they're only holding
my spot at Brown until tomorrow.

345
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:56,074
- I'm going to Berklee School of Music.
- Oh, yeah?

346
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,447
- It's in Boston.
- That's awesome.

347
00:24:58,655 --> 00:25:01,283
If you went to Brown,
we'd only be an hour away.

348
00:25:01,491 --> 00:25:02,788
Yes.

349
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,049
What's wrong?

350
00:25:04,261 --> 00:25:05,956
- Cramp.
- What? What? Hold on.

351
00:25:06,163 --> 00:25:09,257
- My hand's stuck in the seat belt.
- Cramp, cramp, cramp. Cramp.

352
00:25:14,237 --> 00:25:16,797
Okay, last stop. Get out, please.

353
00:25:17,407 --> 00:25:20,376
- What do I owe you?
- It's $8.50.

354
00:25:21,078 --> 00:25:22,739
- There you go, man.
- Okay.

355
00:25:24,181 --> 00:25:26,877
- Thanks for the ride.
- Okay. Careful, now.

356
00:25:27,884 --> 00:25:29,715
- Oh, my God.
- All right, hey.

357
00:25:30,754 --> 00:25:32,722
Cherish one another, folks.

358
00:25:32,923 --> 00:25:34,481
Don't slam my door, please.

359
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:39,791
Nice folks. Charged a little extra
for the cleanup.

360
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,496
That's gonna be fun.

361
00:25:43,967 --> 00:25:47,095
Thanks for sticking that out with me.

362
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:48,968
Yeah.

363
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,818
<i>So that's it, Tris.</i>

364
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:06,477
<i>That's the breakup mix.
Ten songs from my broken...</i>

365
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,983
That was not even real.

366
00:26:11,128 --> 00:26:13,096
Can we go straight
to laughing about this?

367
00:26:13,296 --> 00:26:15,127
- I have to pee.
- Okay.

368
00:26:16,633 --> 00:26:17,691
Go pee.

369
00:26:21,138 --> 00:26:23,538
- Hey, how you been?
- Hi.

370
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:41,255
Caroline, pick up the phone.

371
00:26:46,163 --> 00:26:47,494
Caroline.

372
00:26:51,268 --> 00:26:55,534
Look, Dev, I am sick and tired
of arguing about our band's name.

373
00:26:57,774 --> 00:27:01,073
- What about Shit Sandwich?
- What about Shit Sandwich?

374
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:02,836
We are Shit Sandwich.

375
00:27:03,046 --> 00:27:05,480
Whatever happened to Dickache?
I liked Dickache.

376
00:27:05,682 --> 00:27:09,015
- I got it. What about The Tight Ends?
- Going Balls Deep.

377
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,799
Norah! Norah! Norah!

378
00:28:02,005 --> 00:28:03,632
Brooklyn Pool. I got a clue.

379
00:28:08,578 --> 00:28:11,206
Hey. You are not gonna believe this.

380
00:28:15,619 --> 00:28:17,917
So can't we talk about
how cool Fluffy is?

381
00:28:18,121 --> 00:28:21,488
- They're my favorite band in the world.
- They're my favorite band.

382
00:28:21,691 --> 00:28:23,784
I've gotten so many people
into that band.

383
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:24,983
Me too.

384
00:28:25,195 --> 00:28:28,358
I had a bootleg of "Black Carnage"
before anybody else ever heard it.

385
00:28:28,565 --> 00:28:31,466
I was the first person
outside of the band to hear that song.

386
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,363
- Okay. Yeah.
- I'm sure that I was.

387
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,367
We went to see them
at the Elbow Room.

388
00:28:35,572 --> 00:28:37,437
- Yes?
- And it was a total bait and switch.

389
00:28:37,641 --> 00:28:41,008
- Are You Randy showed up instead.
- That literally makes me wanna die.

390
00:28:41,211 --> 00:28:44,612
Yeah, I hate those guys. I was the one
that got her into Where's Fluffy.

391
00:28:44,814 --> 00:28:45,803
It was me.

392
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:49,577
She'd never even heard of them until I
put one of their songs on a CD for her.

393
00:28:49,786 --> 00:28:52,482
- Tris. I'm talking about Tris.
- Is that right?

394
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:56,056
How well do you know each other?
You go to Sacred Heart together or?

395
00:28:56,259 --> 00:29:00,787
Do you guys talk a lot?
Talk about her new boyfriend?

396
00:29:00,997 --> 00:29:05,798
I cannot believe Tris dated a
straightedge. That's, like, astounding.

397
00:29:06,002 --> 00:29:08,869
What did she say about me?
She said I was a straightedge?

398
00:29:09,072 --> 00:29:12,041
Can I ask, what did you see
in her? I could floss with that girl.

399
00:29:12,242 --> 00:29:13,641
This is your friend?

400
00:29:13,843 --> 00:29:17,176
All right. I'm the bad guy now. This
what we're doing? I'm the bad guy?

401
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,781
If you really wanna know, she actually
supported our music and our band...

402
00:29:20,984 --> 00:29:24,147
...when nobody else did,
not that that's any of your business.

403
00:29:24,487 --> 00:29:27,047
- Okay, forget it. I can't do this.
- Do what?

404
00:29:27,257 --> 00:29:30,385
Just make a U-turn and take me back
to Ludlow. I'll find my own way.

405
00:29:30,594 --> 00:29:32,528
- Perfect.
- I refuse to be the goodie bag...

406
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,663
...at your party.
- You don't have to yell.

407
00:29:34,864 --> 00:29:36,889
It's not a train station.
We're in a car.

408
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,159
- Just drop me off.
- I will.

409
00:29:39,369 --> 00:29:40,427
Oh, my God!

410
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,100
Are you crazy?

411
00:29:48,778 --> 00:29:51,008
I don't know what I did
to make you so angry.

412
00:29:51,214 --> 00:29:53,444
- Nothing. You're ridiculous.
- You don't know me.

413
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,447
- I know you. I know your make.
- My make?

414
00:29:55,652 --> 00:29:57,586
You're an emo-band boy,
obsessed with Tris?

415
00:29:57,787 --> 00:30:00,551
They could make action figures of you.
Drummer not included.

416
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,748
It's funny that Tris
never mentioned you.

417
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:06,224
But she did mention some frigid,
jealous JAP that was jealous of her...

418
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:09,091
...and who was a complete bitch.
- Oh, jealous? Oh, really?

419
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:11,995
- I know who she was referring to.
- Let's dance, douche bag.

420
00:30:12,202 --> 00:30:14,261
Sweetheart,
you think you have something to...

421
00:30:14,471 --> 00:30:16,735
I am not jealous!

422
00:30:17,674 --> 00:30:20,802
Oh, no, man, she's not jealous.

423
00:30:28,518 --> 00:30:30,145
Awesome. Awesome night.

424
00:30:30,353 --> 00:30:33,379
<i>- So how's it going?
- It was great until she choked me out.</i>

425
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,990
<i>- Kinky.
- What's up with you guys?</i>

426
00:30:36,192 --> 00:30:38,183
Well, everything's fine here,
Nick. Peachy.

427
00:30:38,395 --> 00:30:41,193
<i>- It's just we sort of kind of lost the girl.
- What girl?</i>

428
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:42,695
You know, the girl.

429
00:30:43,733 --> 00:30:44,722
What?

430
00:30:44,934 --> 00:30:47,801
<i>Yeah, well, we came to
Gray's Papaya to grab a bite to eat...</i>

431
00:30:48,004 --> 00:30:50,495
<i>...and she must've woke up.
The chick's flown the coop.</i>

432
00:30:50,707 --> 00:30:53,904
<i>- Thom, that's not acceptable.
- I know.</i>

433
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:56,601
So the shitbox stall again?
You want us to pick you up?

434
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,041
Thom, you have to find her.

435
00:30:58,248 --> 00:31:01,581
<i>We already looked everywhere,
Nicky. She's not in the van.</i>

436
00:31:01,785 --> 00:31:04,811
<i>She's not in Gray's Papaya.
She's gone.</i>

437
00:31:06,022 --> 00:31:10,959
So I think now is the time
we cut our losses and go find Fluffy.

438
00:31:11,628 --> 00:31:13,823
<i>Right? Hello, Nicky?</i>

439
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,760
Hey, Tal, it's me. Where are you?

440
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:22,670
<i>- Hey.
- Norah?</i>

441
00:31:22,872 --> 00:31:24,499
They lost Caroline.

442
00:31:25,608 --> 00:31:26,973
What?

443
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:29,302
<i>Norah?</i>

444
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:39,412
You kids been drinking?

445
00:31:39,622 --> 00:31:40,611
- No.
- No.

446
00:31:40,824 --> 00:31:42,985
Why not?
We're having a search party.

447
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:44,854
Search party!

448
00:31:45,662 --> 00:31:46,651
God.

449
00:31:48,231 --> 00:31:49,220
Party.

450
00:31:49,432 --> 00:31:52,833
Search party, N.Y.C.
Search party, N.Y.C.

451
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:55,569
Caroline, where the hell
can you be?

452
00:31:56,806 --> 00:31:58,535
- Caroline.
- Caroline.

453
00:31:58,742 --> 00:32:00,505
Caroline.

454
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,007
Caroline.

455
00:32:02,812 --> 00:32:04,302
Caroline!

456
00:32:04,514 --> 00:32:06,243
Guys, we need to be adults right now.

457
00:32:06,449 --> 00:32:10,112
- I don't have $ 11.
- How much do you have?

458
00:32:10,754 --> 00:32:13,018
- Total?
- Yeah.

459
00:32:21,664 --> 00:32:23,154
One dollar.

460
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,397
One dollar won't get you to Newark.

461
00:32:27,003 --> 00:32:30,996
Oh, no, no. I didn't say
I wanted to go to Newark.

462
00:32:33,843 --> 00:32:35,037
That's so funny.

463
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,675
Okay. I'm just gonna
tell you something.

464
00:32:39,883 --> 00:32:42,579
I was kidnapped tonight. Seriously.

465
00:32:42,786 --> 00:32:46,745
In this van with these guys
talking about going balls deep.

466
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,150
Sounds like fun, right?
Not always. Scary.

467
00:32:56,366 --> 00:32:58,891
I just think the Jerk Offs
isn't hardcore enough.

468
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:02,230
We are not calling ourselves
Shit Sandwich, and that is final.

469
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:05,839
I want my stepfather to have the
possibility of seeing one of our shows.

470
00:33:06,042 --> 00:33:08,943
Yeah, well, I'm a third of this group,
too, Thom, if not more.

471
00:33:09,145 --> 00:33:12,308
- How are you more?
- I'm the lead singer.

472
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,978
- You all right?
- I can't believe...

473
00:33:19,189 --> 00:33:21,419
...I'm missing Where's Fluffy
for this.

474
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:26,724
- Where's Fluffy? Where?
- Well, supposedly at Brooklyn Pool.

475
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,762
We can't go, because we
need to relocate the entire person...

476
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,229
...you guys managed to lose.

477
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,762
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, come on.

478
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:38,304
Okay. Listen, she's probably there.
I mean, the chick likes to party.

479
00:33:38,508 --> 00:33:39,702
I say we do a drive-by.

480
00:33:40,877 --> 00:33:44,040
No. Absolutely not. No drive-bys.

481
00:33:44,747 --> 00:33:47,875
Look, the sooner we find Caroline,
the sooner we can find Fluffy...

482
00:33:48,084 --> 00:33:49,813
...and the sooner this
will be over.

483
00:33:50,253 --> 00:33:52,050
Okay.

484
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:57,350
You know,
if you don't have a drummer...

485
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,223
...then why do you have drums,
you fistful of assholes?

486
00:34:02,866 --> 00:34:04,561
Fistful of Assholes.

487
00:34:05,802 --> 00:34:07,736
I like it.

488
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:23,619
Hi, I'm Caroline. What's your name?

489
00:34:27,624 --> 00:34:29,683
That's okay,
you don't have to tell me.

490
00:34:30,226 --> 00:34:32,353
It's been, like, one of those nights,
you know?

491
00:34:33,763 --> 00:34:35,993
I was with my friend Norah,
who you don't know...

492
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,168
...but you would really like her
because everybody likes Norah...

493
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:43,100
...and she left me tonight, which is...
She never does that.

494
00:34:43,306 --> 00:34:44,796
And then I was kidnapped.

495
00:34:45,975 --> 00:34:49,138
And then she...
Usually when I go home with her...

496
00:34:49,345 --> 00:34:53,111
...she makes me a turkey sandwich
when I get home...

497
00:34:53,316 --> 00:34:56,114
...but I might never get home,
you know?

498
00:34:57,487 --> 00:34:59,751
And I'm so tired.

499
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:12,333
Is that a turkey sandwich?

500
00:35:17,106 --> 00:35:18,334
It is.

501
00:35:25,515 --> 00:35:27,142
Can you hold this for me?

502
00:35:29,852 --> 00:35:31,581
Thank you so much.

503
00:35:31,888 --> 00:35:33,480
Oh, my God.

504
00:35:34,457 --> 00:35:35,481
Hi.

505
00:35:47,837 --> 00:35:49,828
I just need my gum.

506
00:36:01,517 --> 00:36:03,246
Okay, Englewood.

507
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:06,854
Okay. Well, the last bus to Englewood
left seven minutes ago.

508
00:36:07,056 --> 00:36:09,047
You see? She's fine. Let's go.

509
00:36:09,258 --> 00:36:13,490
No, just because there was a last bus
doesn't mean she was on the last bus.

510
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:16,096
- You and your logic.
- I'm trying her again.

511
00:36:36,586 --> 00:36:38,144
I'll get it.

512
00:36:44,427 --> 00:36:45,792
- Norah.
- Caro...

513
00:36:46,863 --> 00:36:48,330
Oh, no.

514
00:37:02,812 --> 00:37:05,406
Oh, God.

515
00:37:06,983 --> 00:37:08,007
Norah?

516
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:11,949
- Help me.
- Caroline, where are you?

517
00:37:12,155 --> 00:37:14,282
<i>- Tell me where you are.
- Norah, my gum.</i>

518
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:17,482
What? Can you hear me? Caroline?

519
00:37:18,327 --> 00:37:19,954
Norah.

520
00:37:21,597 --> 00:37:23,360
Norah, where are you?

521
00:37:23,566 --> 00:37:25,761
<i>- Can you hear me? Caroline?
- Norah?</i>

522
00:37:27,503 --> 00:37:29,095
- Shit.
- Where is she?

523
00:37:29,305 --> 00:37:31,637
I don't know.
I couldn't hear over the music.

524
00:37:45,521 --> 00:37:47,182
Music? What music?

525
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,881
She's at Brooklyn Pool.
She's probably looking for you.

526
00:37:50,093 --> 00:37:51,287
- In Brooklyn?
- Let's go.

527
00:37:52,695 --> 00:37:54,526
To Brooklyn?

528
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,165
Fine, let's go to Brooklyn.

529
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,051
- This is awesome.
- This is ridiculous.

530
00:39:00,263 --> 00:39:03,164
Okay, what are we supposed to do
if she's not here, you guys?

531
00:39:03,366 --> 00:39:06,096
When she's not here,
because she's not, obviously.

532
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,998
Hello. How you doing? Hi.

533
00:39:09,205 --> 00:39:11,696
- Everybody in. Pile on in.
- Really? Are you sure?

534
00:39:11,908 --> 00:39:13,000
There you go.

535
00:39:21,284 --> 00:39:24,219
- No.
- I've been here for an hour.

536
00:39:24,887 --> 00:39:25,876
No, you can't get in.

537
00:39:36,299 --> 00:39:38,324
Hey, were you on YouTube
or something?

538
00:39:38,534 --> 00:39:39,523
What?

539
00:39:40,036 --> 00:39:41,469
Who are you?

540
00:39:41,904 --> 00:39:43,371
I'm Norah.

541
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,732
I'm no one.
I'm just the daughter of someone.

542
00:39:47,944 --> 00:39:49,241
Daughter of who?

543
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:52,541
My dad. I'm gonna
go find Caroline, okay?

544
00:39:52,815 --> 00:39:54,305
Yeah, good luck.

545
00:39:55,751 --> 00:39:56,809
That's my song.

546
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:59,249
Really? It's my song kind of.
Really? That's cool.

547
00:39:59,455 --> 00:40:00,888
You dance?

548
00:40:02,058 --> 00:40:03,184
Can we dance like this?

549
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,493
When they wrote this song, they were
hoping people would dance like this.

550
00:40:10,733 --> 00:40:13,099
Go like this.
You're not supposed to actually...

551
00:40:13,302 --> 00:40:16,362
Try and get as close to my hands
as you can without touching them.

552
00:40:17,106 --> 00:40:20,303
- This is a very good dance, Nick.
- This is the pedal boat.

553
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:33,954
You know the blow-dryer?

554
00:40:36,692 --> 00:40:37,954
- Okay.
- Doesn't work on mine.

555
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,321
Oh, no, it doesn't. Wow, you're soft.

556
00:40:40,529 --> 00:40:43,794
I asked for the Ellen DeGeneres
haircut.

557
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:46,327
Oh, my God.

558
00:40:47,503 --> 00:40:48,629
Hey. Oh, hey.

559
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:51,631
Dance-wich.

560
00:40:52,041 --> 00:40:54,305
- He's pushing me. I'm not doing it.
- It's okay.

561
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,738
- It's not me.
- It's all him.

562
00:40:55,945 --> 00:40:58,914
He's making me do it.
I'm not doing it.

563
00:40:59,115 --> 00:41:01,709
It's not your fault. It's all right.
Oh, man. Oh, my God.

564
00:41:02,985 --> 00:41:04,009
Hi there.

565
00:41:05,221 --> 00:41:07,018
Oh, hi.

566
00:41:09,191 --> 00:41:10,180
Hey, baby.

567
00:41:10,393 --> 00:41:12,588
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

568
00:41:12,795 --> 00:41:14,888
Looking for Fluffy.
What are you doing here?

569
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:16,462
We're looking for Caroline.

570
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:20,693
Oh, Caroline. What, can't you just
follow the umbilical cord?

571
00:41:22,738 --> 00:41:24,899
- What's up?
- Hi.

572
00:41:25,641 --> 00:41:28,337
Nick, this is Tal. Tal, this is Nick,
Tris' latest victim.

573
00:41:28,544 --> 00:41:30,011
Oh, serious?

574
00:41:32,415 --> 00:41:35,509
Well... Oh, but you're in that
gay band...

575
00:41:36,585 --> 00:41:37,643
...We're Gay.

576
00:41:37,853 --> 00:41:39,912
The Jerk Offs.
And we're not all gay.

577
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:41,919
Yeah. You were pretty decent.

578
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:46,356
Except for being one arm short
of a Def Leppard cover group.

579
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:50,160
All right, yeah, take care, fellas.

580
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,558
You guys were pretty good except...

581
00:41:52,768 --> 00:41:57,102
...you were two penises short of
a Shania Twain re-imagination band.

582
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,295
You're done.

583
00:41:58,507 --> 00:42:03,171
Prettiest shoulders, prettiest hair,
prettiest ears.

584
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,213
- Thanks.
- Gorgeous ears.

585
00:42:07,783 --> 00:42:09,216
Here we go.

586
00:42:09,452 --> 00:42:11,818
<i>Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy!</i>

587
00:42:12,021 --> 00:42:14,546
<i>Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy!</i>

588
00:42:27,269 --> 00:42:28,566
Yes.

589
00:42:28,771 --> 00:42:30,102
Fluffy!

590
00:42:32,942 --> 00:42:37,072
Okay. The hype man
knows what you want...

591
00:42:37,279 --> 00:42:39,406
...but he's not sure
if you want it enough.

592
00:42:40,449 --> 00:42:42,246
Do you really want it?

593
00:42:42,718 --> 00:42:46,085
Do you really want it?
Do you really want it?

594
00:42:46,288 --> 00:42:47,983
I said, do you really want it?

595
00:42:49,425 --> 00:42:50,687
I got one question.

596
00:42:51,227 --> 00:42:52,216
Are...

597
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,287
...You...

598
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,926
...Randy?

599
00:42:57,833 --> 00:42:58,822
You suck.

600
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:01,666
- Damn it.
- The bait and switch.

601
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:04,101
- Randy, you suck.
- Go ahead.

602
00:43:12,815 --> 00:43:16,842
So, listen, baby,
what are you doing tonight?

603
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:21,284
Aside from you being beautiful. I got
something I really want you to hear.

604
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:23,651
Look here. I need to talk to you
right now.

605
00:43:23,859 --> 00:43:26,419
I got some important stuff
I need to talk to you about.

606
00:43:26,629 --> 00:43:28,688
Okay, well, I'm gonna...

607
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,127
You have fun, okay?

608
00:43:33,002 --> 00:43:35,129
I'm just gonna go find Caroline, okay?

609
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,366
You're just gonna call me
in 45 minutes anyways.

610
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:40,698
With a gay band.

611
00:44:07,136 --> 00:44:09,832
- Hi.
- Hey.

612
00:44:19,248 --> 00:44:20,875
Thanks.

613
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,848
Come on.

614
00:44:26,489 --> 00:44:29,253
I thought we were gonna...

615
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:33,861
No, we're not, we're gonna...
Just get in the cab, Gary, come on.

616
00:44:37,066 --> 00:44:38,055
Follow that van.

617
00:44:56,285 --> 00:44:59,152
- So is that guy your boyfriend?
- Sort of.

618
00:44:59,355 --> 00:45:02,256
He's sort of your boyfriend,
or he's your sort-of boyfriend?

619
00:45:02,458 --> 00:45:05,086
He's sort of my ex-boyfriend,
most of the time.

620
00:45:05,294 --> 00:45:07,990
- What is he the rest of the time?
- We're friends.

621
00:45:08,197 --> 00:45:11,257
- With benefits?
- Yeah, it's just the never-ending story.

622
00:45:11,934 --> 00:45:14,664
- That's like me and Tris.
- No, that ended, remember?

623
00:45:15,771 --> 00:45:16,760
I mean...

624
00:45:16,972 --> 00:45:20,271
Excuse me, you have a boyfriend
or an ex-boyfriend with benefits...

625
00:45:20,476 --> 00:45:23,104
...but you still go around
kissing total strangers?

626
00:45:23,312 --> 00:45:25,780
Trust me, that was an act
of desperation.

627
00:45:25,981 --> 00:45:27,881
Oh, yeah, okay.
Seemed pretty desperate.

628
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:30,574
Oh, okay. Well, Nick,
you're not a total stranger, huh?

629
00:45:30,786 --> 00:45:33,755
In fact, I am rife
with too much information.

630
00:45:34,924 --> 00:45:35,913
What does that mean?

631
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:38,719
Okay, hi. I hate to break up
the love-fest back there...

632
00:45:38,928 --> 00:45:41,658
...but does anyone wanna tell us
where we're going?

633
00:45:42,264 --> 00:45:45,131
- I can narrow this down.
- Well, let's hear it, sister.

634
00:45:45,334 --> 00:45:47,928
You know how some people like to eat
in the same places?

635
00:45:48,137 --> 00:45:49,434
Yes.

636
00:45:49,638 --> 00:45:52,266
Okay, Caroline likes to barf
in the same places.

637
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:04,777
Hey, we're gonna get a hot dog
around the corner.

638
00:46:14,296 --> 00:46:17,925
- Oh, no. No more. No more.
- Have you seen her?

639
00:46:18,133 --> 00:46:20,624
Your girlfriend puked
in the ice cream again.

640
00:46:20,836 --> 00:46:23,168
Last time it took me one hour
to chip out.

641
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:28,004
Hey. Hey.

642
00:46:28,978 --> 00:46:31,003
Thought you got a ride home.

643
00:46:31,213 --> 00:46:33,511
- What, do you like him or something?
- Do you?

644
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:36,741
Well, I was with the guy
for six months, so...

645
00:46:36,952 --> 00:46:39,011
And you cheated on him
for six months, so...

646
00:46:39,221 --> 00:46:42,884
- You didn't tell him that, did you?
- No, I didn't tell him that.

647
00:46:43,525 --> 00:46:44,514
Good.

648
00:46:44,727 --> 00:46:47,753
- I just feel like she's messing with me.
- Who are we talking about?

649
00:46:48,664 --> 00:46:53,397
Right now, Norah. No, Tris. Tris.

650
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:56,435
- You just haven't figured it out yet.
- What?

651
00:46:57,006 --> 00:46:59,702
It. You know, it, the big picture.

652
00:47:00,876 --> 00:47:02,207
I guess not.

653
00:47:02,411 --> 00:47:03,605
The Beatles.

654
00:47:06,415 --> 00:47:09,407
- What about them?
- This.

655
00:47:10,085 --> 00:47:12,883
Look, other bands,
they wanna make it about sex or pain.

656
00:47:13,088 --> 00:47:15,648
But, you know, the Beatles,
they had it all figured out.

657
00:47:15,858 --> 00:47:19,851
"I Wanna Hold Your Hand. " That's the
first single. It's F-ing brilliant, right?

658
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:26,029
The guy actually cried. I mean, I made
guys cry before, but I really broke him.

659
00:47:26,235 --> 00:47:28,032
And I'm saying this
for the both of you.

660
00:47:28,237 --> 00:47:30,068
I mean, I don't wanna
see you get hurt...

661
00:47:30,272 --> 00:47:33,241
...but I don't wanna see him get
any more hurt, either, you know?

662
00:47:33,442 --> 00:47:34,932
What do you mean?

663
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:37,738
Word on the street is
you never had an orgasm.

664
00:47:40,249 --> 00:47:42,376
Because that's what
everybody wants, Nicky.

665
00:47:42,584 --> 00:47:44,552
They don't want a 24-hour
hump sesh.

666
00:47:44,753 --> 00:47:48,484
They don't wanna be married to you
for a hundred years.

667
00:47:48,691 --> 00:47:52,092
They just wanna hold your hand.

668
00:47:57,766 --> 00:47:59,700
I'm gonna stop doing that.

669
00:48:00,703 --> 00:48:04,161
Tris? So who was on the street when
you heard this "word on the street"?

670
00:48:04,373 --> 00:48:05,601
Was Caroline on the street?

671
00:48:05,808 --> 00:48:08,800
It's okay. I mean, some people
just can't have one.

672
00:48:10,112 --> 00:48:13,013
I can have one. Okay?

673
00:48:13,215 --> 00:48:15,775
I've probably had, like,
a million in my life, so...

674
00:48:15,984 --> 00:48:17,349
Oh, sure, yeah.

675
00:48:17,553 --> 00:48:19,748
How am I supposed to know,
you know?

676
00:48:19,955 --> 00:48:21,923
Oh, you'd know.

677
00:48:24,626 --> 00:48:28,153
Look, I'm just afraid that if he gets
with you and nothing happens...

678
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:31,821
...his self-esteem could really
go through the crapper, you know?

679
00:48:35,137 --> 00:48:38,436
- This is Tris.
- Oh, hey, bitch. It's Caroline.

680
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,609
- What? Give me the phone.
- Wait, what do you mean, kidnapped?

681
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:44,335
- Why didn't she call me?
- You're totally grounded.

682
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:46,844
- Give it to me.
- Hold on.

683
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,983
Where are you? We've been looking
for you everywhere.

684
00:48:50,185 --> 00:48:53,677
<i>- Norah? I found Jesus.
- What?</i>

685
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:57,154
Jesus! He's much taller in person.

686
00:48:57,826 --> 00:48:59,987
<i>I'm at a church, I think.</i>

687
00:49:00,195 --> 00:49:05,497
<i>- It's so churchy and beautiful.
- It's a church. Okay, which church?</i>

688
00:49:05,701 --> 00:49:09,330
- Norah, I have to follow Jesus now.
- No, Caroline...

689
00:49:09,538 --> 00:49:11,369
There's an altar boy
with no pants on.

690
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:13,734
Why do you have no pants on,
altar boy?

691
00:49:15,878 --> 00:49:18,005
Great. I have to find Jesus now.

692
00:49:18,881 --> 00:49:20,815
- Nor?
- Yeah?

693
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:23,850
- My phone.
- Here.

694
00:49:42,237 --> 00:49:43,329
- Hey.
- Hey.

695
00:49:44,072 --> 00:49:45,369
You all right?

696
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:47,264
Is she okay?

697
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:49,199
Yeah.

698
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:52,375
I got a clue, guys.

699
00:49:53,248 --> 00:49:56,012
- Are we done?
- One last stop.

700
00:49:58,687 --> 00:50:01,212
A Yugo. We're looking for a Yugo.

701
00:50:01,924 --> 00:50:04,984
- She said a church.
- All right, let me check it out.

702
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,904
What's wrong?

703
00:50:27,249 --> 00:50:28,546
Tris is what's wrong.

704
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:32,982
Tris? Please. That girl's got nothing
on you. I mean, for one, she's awful.

705
00:50:33,188 --> 00:50:34,177
Awful.

706
00:50:34,389 --> 00:50:36,823
- Yeah. And for two, you're amazing.
- Amazing.

707
00:50:43,432 --> 00:50:44,729
Yeah, well.

708
00:50:50,873 --> 00:50:52,704
- Hey.
- Sorry, sorry.

709
00:50:52,908 --> 00:50:55,001
- I'm sleeping here.
- You trying to take my BLT?

710
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:57,235
- It's cool, Switzerland. I got this.
- Hey.

711
00:50:57,446 --> 00:51:00,472
- What's up, friend? How you doing?
- Good. I was just gonna go in...

712
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,707
- You walked right in here.
- I didn't mean to.

713
00:51:02,918 --> 00:51:05,011
You're like a little canary
in skinny jeans.

714
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:07,154
I was gonna go in
to look for my friend.

715
00:51:07,356 --> 00:51:10,621
You got friends right here. Me and
Switzerland are here for you, baby.

716
00:51:10,826 --> 00:51:13,693
Let me ask you a question.
You ever hook up with a dog?

717
00:51:13,896 --> 00:51:17,161
No. What? Like an an...
A dog, like a pet? No.

718
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:20,995
Don't. It's not worth it.
I like you so much.

719
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:25,503
- I'm running away. I'm running.
- Run away. Run away, little canary.

720
00:51:25,908 --> 00:51:29,139
Okay. Okay.
What exactly did she say to you?

721
00:51:29,912 --> 00:51:31,971
Something about an altar boy
with no pants.

722
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,977
I don't know
what she was talking about.

723
00:51:34,182 --> 00:51:37,015
Midnight Ass. The all-male
"holigay" revue at Camera Obscura.

724
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:40,450
"Deck the Balls," "O Horny Night. "
You guys never went to that?

725
00:51:40,656 --> 00:51:42,385
A Christmas show
at this time of year?

726
00:51:42,591 --> 00:51:45,219
Since when does a queen
need an excuse to sing?

727
00:51:52,167 --> 00:51:53,156
Go, girl.

728
00:52:27,836 --> 00:52:29,098
- Did you find her?
- No.

729
00:52:35,644 --> 00:52:37,009
Merry Christmas.

730
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,413
Norah. Happy Hanukkah, Norah!

731
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:43,379
I made it to Broadway.

732
00:52:43,585 --> 00:52:45,678
- I'll get her.
- Thanks.

733
00:52:46,154 --> 00:52:48,418
This tree is drunk.

734
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:52,957
Norah, it's Yugo.
He came to rescue me.

735
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:02,197
It's right here, right here.
Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Right here.

736
00:53:10,278 --> 00:53:12,371
I'll text you. Okay?

737
00:53:14,182 --> 00:53:16,150
Want us to take you
back to the Yugo, Nicky?

738
00:53:16,351 --> 00:53:17,340
Yeah, sure.

739
00:53:22,557 --> 00:53:25,321
- The bass is really good.
- Thank you.

740
00:53:29,431 --> 00:53:31,558
- You okay?
- No.

741
00:53:32,868 --> 00:53:37,328
- You guys must be really good friends.
- Yes, I am a great friend.

742
00:53:37,539 --> 00:53:42,135
It's always been like this. I'm the head
squire in Caroline's quest for attention.

743
00:53:44,946 --> 00:53:46,243
That's gross.

744
00:53:47,082 --> 00:53:50,381
You wanna...
I got one of these things.

745
00:53:53,321 --> 00:53:54,481
You have a Handi Wipe?

746
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:57,185
Kind of handy.

747
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,693
What a gentleman.

748
00:53:59,895 --> 00:54:01,123
Yeah, I...

749
00:54:01,329 --> 00:54:05,425
We had Chinese food, like,
three weeks ago, and I haven't used it.

750
00:54:06,568 --> 00:54:09,935
I never wash my pants.
I like to keep the night on them.

751
00:54:17,012 --> 00:54:20,277
I've been thinking more
about Brown.

752
00:54:20,482 --> 00:54:21,813
Yeah.

753
00:54:22,017 --> 00:54:25,180
I think it'd be nice
to know someone an hour away.

754
00:54:26,455 --> 00:54:27,444
Yeah.

755
00:54:29,658 --> 00:54:33,389
I really wouldn't mind getting away
from my minion duties.

756
00:54:42,504 --> 00:54:45,803
- Oh, Jesus.
- What?

757
00:55:02,858 --> 00:55:05,622
Maybe I should just go
deal with it right now.

758
00:55:10,065 --> 00:55:11,726
- Well, how will you get home?
- Nicky.

759
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:15,198
We'll get home fine.
You guys can still drop us off, right?

760
00:55:16,404 --> 00:55:18,065
Yeah.

761
00:55:28,049 --> 00:55:29,209
Nick.

762
00:55:31,486 --> 00:55:33,750
Nice meeting you.

763
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:04,077
- Hi.
- Hi.

764
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:07,755
- What are you doing here?
- You know what I'm doing here.

765
00:56:07,956 --> 00:56:09,446
No, I really don't.

766
00:56:11,626 --> 00:56:14,754
Well, it wasn't hard to find
the only Yugo in the city.

767
00:56:14,963 --> 00:56:17,193
I think it's the only Yugo
in the country.

768
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,825
Aren't you gonna
open the door for me?

769
00:56:21,036 --> 00:56:24,995
- Well, where are we going?
- You're giving me a ride home.

770
00:56:25,807 --> 00:56:28,207
Why don't you get a ride
from that new guy?

771
00:56:28,643 --> 00:56:30,907
Well, he doesn't have a Yugo.

772
00:56:34,115 --> 00:56:38,518
It's just a ride. It's late. Please?

773
00:56:41,122 --> 00:56:42,111
Okay.

774
00:56:52,834 --> 00:56:55,098
- Here.
- But I don't want your gum.

775
00:56:55,303 --> 00:56:57,396
Just take it. God.

776
00:57:07,782 --> 00:57:09,807
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, Tal.</i>

777
00:57:10,018 --> 00:57:12,145
<i>Norah.</i>

778
00:57:12,754 --> 00:57:14,051
Where are you?

779
00:57:20,762 --> 00:57:25,859
You should go. I'll be fine.
Don't worry about me. Go.

780
00:57:27,702 --> 00:57:29,533
Okay.

781
00:57:32,507 --> 00:57:33,633
Bye.

782
00:57:33,842 --> 00:57:35,776
Have fun. I love you.

783
00:57:35,977 --> 00:57:37,808
I miss you already.

784
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:44,675
You guys got directions?
You know where you're going?

785
00:57:44,886 --> 00:57:47,184
- Yeah, we got them.
- Okay. No stopping.

786
00:57:47,389 --> 00:57:49,254
No stopping for anything.

787
00:57:49,457 --> 00:57:52,688
I don't care if Brad Pitt is selling fruit
in a thong on the GW.

788
00:57:52,894 --> 00:57:56,762
- You cannot stop, okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, we know. We know.

789
00:57:57,866 --> 00:58:02,360
Well, good night,
my hetero heroine.

790
00:58:03,071 --> 00:58:05,562
Good night, Dev. Good night, Thom.

791
00:58:06,675 --> 00:58:08,370
It was a really fun night.

792
00:58:09,177 --> 00:58:11,372
God, I don't know
what your name is.

793
00:58:13,214 --> 00:58:14,738
It's Lethario.

794
00:58:17,686 --> 00:58:18,948
Nice.

795
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,968
- There you are, yay.
- Hi.

796
00:58:37,706 --> 00:58:39,571
- You made it.
- Yes.

797
00:58:39,774 --> 00:58:41,742
You graced us with your presence.

798
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:44,371
You're the coolest girl ever.

799
00:58:44,913 --> 00:58:46,403
- You wanna come have a seat?
- Yes.

800
00:58:46,614 --> 00:58:48,878
- Okay, come. Step.
- Hi.

801
00:58:49,084 --> 00:58:50,073
- Hey there.
- Hey.

802
00:58:52,587 --> 00:58:55,613
So did you ever find Winehouse?

803
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:57,985
- Yes. And you don't wanna know.
- Yeah?

804
00:58:58,193 --> 00:58:59,524
Don't even ask.

805
00:58:59,728 --> 00:59:02,595
You're gonna be an amazing mother
one day.

806
00:59:04,132 --> 00:59:05,759
Thanks. I guess so.

807
00:59:06,735 --> 00:59:08,532
What is this jacket?

808
00:59:09,104 --> 00:59:11,038
Who is Salvatore?

809
00:59:11,239 --> 00:59:13,730
I got something to be worried
about here?

810
00:59:14,075 --> 00:59:15,804
- It's just a jacket.
- Yeah?

811
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,341
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

812
00:59:31,459 --> 00:59:33,757
I feel so safe here.

813
00:59:34,229 --> 00:59:37,062
Like when I was a kid driving home
with my parents...

814
00:59:37,265 --> 00:59:40,359
...from some trip somewhere...

815
00:59:40,568 --> 00:59:45,198
...and I couldn't help
but fall asleep because that car...

816
00:59:45,407 --> 00:59:47,637
...like I was already home.

817
00:59:48,243 --> 00:59:52,373
And that's how you feel, Nicky.
Like I'm already home.

818
00:59:56,484 --> 01:00:00,614
Look, your car misses me.
It's falling apart without me.

819
01:00:02,323 --> 01:00:03,790
But you just did that.

820
01:00:03,992 --> 01:00:05,220
Oh, come on.

821
01:00:06,327 --> 01:00:08,158
Are you really over me?

822
01:00:09,931 --> 01:00:13,924
You wouldn't have to get over me
if you were still under me.

823
01:00:14,669 --> 01:00:15,658
Yeah.

824
01:00:16,337 --> 01:00:17,827
Wait, wait, wait.

825
01:00:18,106 --> 01:00:19,403
What?

826
01:00:19,607 --> 01:00:21,632
Just, you know, I'm driving.
And try not...

827
01:00:21,843 --> 01:00:24,744
Let's go down by the river. Right here.

828
01:00:34,956 --> 01:00:37,982
- I'm very glad you came to see me.
- Me too.

829
01:00:38,193 --> 01:00:39,251
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

830
01:00:39,828 --> 01:00:41,989
You know, I brought a present
for you.

831
01:00:42,197 --> 01:00:46,861
What? You didn't have to get me
any present.

832
01:00:51,306 --> 01:00:54,434
<i>So the history of the name,
Oz- rael...</i>

833
01:00:54,642 --> 01:00:57,907
...it's like anarchy meets Zionism,
you know. It's ironic.

834
01:00:58,112 --> 01:01:02,606
Oh, man. You think Israel's ready
for all this Jew fire?

835
01:01:02,817 --> 01:01:04,876
Are you kidding me?
We bring the Jew fire.

836
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,244
So...

837
01:01:07,489 --> 01:01:08,854
...do you like it?

838
01:01:12,026 --> 01:01:13,015
Yeah?

839
01:01:13,228 --> 01:01:15,253
Serious? Oh, that means so much.

840
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:17,658
That means so much.
Thank you so much. Really?

841
01:01:17,866 --> 01:01:20,357
Really? Oh, thank you.

842
01:01:20,568 --> 01:01:24,197
And you think your dad will like it?

843
01:01:27,509 --> 01:01:31,206
- Whenever you're ready.
- Hey, what?

844
01:01:32,514 --> 01:01:35,745
- No. Did they just charge us?
- What?

845
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:39,249
Did they just charge us?
What the hell?

846
01:01:40,555 --> 01:01:43,080
Could you please talk to someone
about this, please?

847
01:01:43,892 --> 01:01:47,760
- About that? Sure.
- Yeah? Really?

848
01:01:47,962 --> 01:01:49,725
Yeah. Sit tight.

849
01:01:50,598 --> 01:01:54,625
Thank you.
You're the coolest girl ever.

850
01:01:56,371 --> 01:01:57,668
Excuse me.

851
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:01,402
I think you meant two zeros,
not one.

852
01:02:03,044 --> 01:02:04,033
Thank you.

853
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:24,927
I've been kind of getting some
mixed signals from you lately.

854
01:02:25,667 --> 01:02:26,691
Yeah?

855
01:02:27,602 --> 01:02:28,864
Sort of.

856
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,376
Clears that up.

857
01:02:43,084 --> 01:02:44,483
That's my song.

858
01:02:47,121 --> 01:02:48,145
Yeah.

859
01:04:17,412 --> 01:04:18,504
Hey.

860
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,175
Hey, Nick.

861
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:24,150
Are you kidding me?

862
01:04:32,226 --> 01:04:33,386
Gary?

863
01:05:08,329 --> 01:05:09,819
Assorted meat plate?

864
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:12,295
Great. Just keep it coming.
Thank you.

865
01:05:24,312 --> 01:05:25,609
Nicholas' phone.

866
01:05:25,813 --> 01:05:27,644
<i>Hi, is Nick there?</i>

867
01:05:27,849 --> 01:05:31,046
No, he's not. Would you like
to call back for his voice mail?

868
01:05:31,252 --> 01:05:33,220
<i>Can I just leave a message?</i>

869
01:05:33,755 --> 01:05:36,087
Yeah, but if I need a pen,
you're shit out of luck.

870
01:05:36,991 --> 01:05:38,083
Could you tell him...

871
01:05:38,292 --> 01:05:41,056
...that he really blew it tonight
when he got out of the van?

872
01:05:44,098 --> 01:05:49,331
<i>And that he knows Norah probably
never wants to see him again...</i>

873
01:05:49,537 --> 01:05:52,301
<i>...and he'd like to apologize to her
in person.</i>

874
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:55,231
Really?

875
01:05:55,977 --> 01:05:59,208
Yeah, where are you?
Did you leave the city?

876
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:02,814
<i>- I'm at Veselka.
- What are the cross streets?</i>

877
01:06:03,284 --> 01:06:04,273
Second and Ninth.

878
01:06:04,485 --> 01:06:07,511
<i>Okay, well, don't leave.
I'm gonna come over, okay?</i>

879
01:06:07,722 --> 01:06:10,088
In the meantime,
could you pass that message on?

880
01:06:51,365 --> 01:06:52,889
Hey.

881
01:06:56,404 --> 01:06:57,735
I have a confession to make.

882
01:06:58,506 --> 01:06:59,564
Oh, you do?

883
01:07:00,074 --> 01:07:01,200
I like your jacket.

884
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:05,640
- Oh, thanks. Well, it's not mine.
- It should be.

885
01:07:05,847 --> 01:07:07,974
It belongs to Salvatore.

886
01:07:08,182 --> 01:07:10,946
Well, he told me
that he wants you to keep it.

887
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:12,141
He does?

888
01:07:12,353 --> 01:07:14,787
- Yeah, he thinks it looks better on you.
- That's nice.

889
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:17,082
But don't tell his wife,
because she gets crazy.

890
01:07:17,291 --> 01:07:19,418
- And jealous.
- She's hostile?

891
01:07:19,627 --> 01:07:23,222
- Is this your gum here?
- Don't touch it. I'm not done.

892
01:07:23,431 --> 01:07:25,092
It must maintain its freshness.

893
01:07:28,436 --> 01:07:31,599
So I also have a confession.

894
01:07:34,242 --> 01:07:37,973
- Before Tal, I never really...
- What?

895
01:07:40,915 --> 01:07:44,783
- Kissed anyone else till tonight.
- Really?

896
01:07:44,986 --> 01:07:46,578
Yeah.

897
01:07:46,787 --> 01:07:49,779
Unless you count Becca Weiner
at camp when I was 13.

898
01:07:49,991 --> 01:07:52,755
- I do count Becca Weiner.
- You do?

899
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,726
I don't know who wouldn't. You'd
have to be a fool not to count her.

900
01:07:57,231 --> 01:08:00,860
- How long were you guys together?
- Three campfire-y nights.

901
01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:07,635
Oh, me and Tal? I knew that.
Three years total.

902
01:08:08,342 --> 01:08:09,673
Friends with benefits?

903
01:08:10,278 --> 01:08:11,609
I guess.

904
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:14,772
Well, what are the benefits?

905
01:08:14,982 --> 01:08:17,815
Yeah, that's crossed my mind.
I don't know.

906
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:22,085
I don't know.
He's just always been there...

907
01:08:22,356 --> 01:08:25,189
...and you just feel ignored
for long enough...

908
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:28,294
...and it's just nice
to feel special sometimes.

909
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:32,356
What is it that keeps two people
together for such a long time...

910
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:34,659
...when it's just not working?

911
01:08:34,869 --> 01:08:36,962
I can call my parents and ask them.

912
01:08:40,708 --> 01:08:43,768
- Do you wanna go somewhere?
- Yeah.

913
01:08:44,145 --> 01:08:45,840
Where do you wanna go?

914
01:08:46,047 --> 01:08:49,539
Anywhere. I mean,
it's only 4 in the morning.

915
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:51,547
Where do you wanna go?

916
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:55,512
Somewhere nobody we know
will find us.

917
01:08:55,723 --> 01:08:57,384
Yeah.

918
01:08:57,825 --> 01:08:59,520
I'll drive.

919
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:09,961
Aren't you impressed
that I drive stick like a pro?

920
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:16,076
This is amazing. You are literally
like my musical soul mate.

921
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:19,508
It's unbelievable.
Except for all the Cure.

922
01:09:19,714 --> 01:09:21,011
What's wrong with the Cure?

923
01:09:21,215 --> 01:09:24,184
There's nothing wrong with the Cure,
actually, but just the name.

924
01:09:24,385 --> 01:09:27,786
You know, the Cure?
What are they the Curing?

925
01:09:27,989 --> 01:09:30,958
Get it? They should be called
the Cause, right?

926
01:09:32,827 --> 01:09:35,591
Maybe I'll take this for a bit
and you can focus on driving.

927
01:09:35,796 --> 01:09:38,356
What, you don't like
my sweet grooves?

928
01:09:38,566 --> 01:09:40,261
I need something
to distract myself...

929
01:09:40,468 --> 01:09:43,437
...from the fact that you're driving
my car pretty recklessly.

930
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:45,161
I am a great driver.

931
01:09:46,407 --> 01:09:47,396
Fine.

932
01:09:53,714 --> 01:09:55,443
Oh, this is a really fancy
parking job.

933
01:09:55,649 --> 01:09:59,016
It's good because if another car wants
to park between us and the curb...

934
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:00,482
...he can get right in here.

935
01:10:00,688 --> 01:10:04,488
Fine. I'll get closer to the curb,
just for you. Just for you, Nick.

936
01:10:04,759 --> 01:10:06,989
Just because you're picky like that.

937
01:10:07,862 --> 01:10:09,921
Shit.

938
01:10:14,668 --> 01:10:19,105
You're close enough to the curb now.
We're right on it.

939
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:21,269
Sorry I broke your car.

940
01:10:21,475 --> 01:10:24,308
Yeah, don't worry.
We'll call a tow truck or some...

941
01:10:24,812 --> 01:10:26,074
And...

942
01:10:26,781 --> 01:10:28,248
Welcome to...

943
01:10:28,482 --> 01:10:31,815
Electric Lady Studios.
Built by Jimi Hendrix in 1970.

944
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:35,583
What? Do you have any idea
who recorded here?

945
01:10:35,790 --> 01:10:38,884
Led Zeppelin? ACIDC?
The Rolling Stones?

946
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:40,957
David Bowie?

947
01:10:43,264 --> 01:10:45,289
Your dad owns this place?

948
01:10:46,434 --> 01:10:47,423
Is he this man?

949
01:10:48,335 --> 01:10:49,859
Yeah.

950
01:10:57,344 --> 01:11:00,006
So, what is he, like a former hippie,
current yuppie...

951
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:02,944
...spoon-feeding the masses
the same old garbage?

952
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:04,811
Stop me at any time.

953
01:11:05,252 --> 01:11:06,241
Yes.

954
01:11:06,454 --> 01:11:07,921
- Yeah.
- Yes.

955
01:11:08,689 --> 01:11:11,852
I'm gonna use that in my graduation
speech. That's, like, amazing.

956
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:14,152
- Cool. Good.
- Here, come on.

957
01:11:16,997 --> 01:11:19,659
<i>They were supposed to show up
at Brooklyn Pool tonight...</i>

958
01:11:19,867 --> 01:11:22,028
<i>...but it looks like Where's Fluffy
is gonna...</i>

959
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:25,831
<i>- Hold on. Listen.
- I don't think they deserve it.</i>

960
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:27,564
<i>- I should tell them?
- Yes.</i>

961
01:11:27,775 --> 01:11:30,608
<i>- I shouldn't tell them?
- Yes, of course you should. Come on.</i>

962
01:11:30,811 --> 01:11:34,838
<i>All right. We'll give you a hint.
Are you ready?</i>

963
01:11:35,049 --> 01:11:41,420
<i>Five, 68, 100 and 21.</i>

964
01:11:41,622 --> 01:11:42,816
Oh, come on.

965
01:11:43,023 --> 01:11:45,753
- The numbers. They mean something.
- It's a clue.

966
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,827
- What did he say?
- So stupid.

967
01:11:49,797 --> 01:11:51,992
- Sixty-nine.
- No, 68. Get out of the gutter.

968
01:11:52,199 --> 01:11:53,826
The alphabet. The A...

969
01:11:54,034 --> 01:11:56,935
- There aren't 68 letters in the alphabet.
- I hate you sometimes.

970
01:11:57,138 --> 01:11:59,265
- Well, think, damn it.
- Five from 68, that's...

971
01:11:59,473 --> 01:12:01,065
Retarded.
Gotta be something else.

972
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:04,244
Song titles. Do we know
songs with numbers in the title?

973
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:05,776
It's a address.

974
01:12:07,047 --> 01:12:10,847
Fifth Avenue, 68th Street,
New York, New York...

975
01:12:11,051 --> 01:12:15,681
...10021.

976
01:12:16,991 --> 01:12:19,926
- It's an address. It's an address.
- Turn!

977
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:21,594
- No, I can't. Wait.
- Just do it!

978
01:12:21,795 --> 01:12:22,955
Oh, my God!

979
01:13:00,301 --> 01:13:01,290
I'm gonna throw up.

980
01:13:02,069 --> 01:13:04,594
Well, don't throw up
on the Strat. Please.

981
01:13:04,805 --> 01:13:07,330
Yeah, I'll try not to.
Can I pick this up?

982
01:13:07,541 --> 01:13:09,031
Yeah.

983
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:11,944
My God.

984
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:14,111
It's left-handed.

985
01:13:16,951 --> 01:13:19,351
It's like playing for the first time.

986
01:13:21,555 --> 01:13:24,217
Is this the job that you have
lined up?

987
01:13:24,425 --> 01:13:27,553
- It's mine if I want it, yeah.
- Well, how could you not want this?

988
01:13:27,761 --> 01:13:31,197
I don't know. I love music,
you know what I mean?

989
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:33,897
But I feel like if I work in it
in here...

990
01:13:34,101 --> 01:13:36,160
...I might not love it
the same way anymore.

991
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:42,436
I loved your mixes, by the way.

992
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:44,299
You heard those?

993
01:13:45,179 --> 01:13:49,878
I heard one. Or seven.
Yeah, I have seven of them.

994
01:13:52,353 --> 01:13:54,821
I knew you liked Where's Fluffy
before I asked.

995
01:13:56,323 --> 01:13:57,312
That's kind of creepy.

996
01:14:00,694 --> 01:14:05,028
- What was your favorite song?
- Let's see. My favorite verse was:

997
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:09,191
"The way you're moving in your sleep,
the way you look before you leap...

998
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:13,567
...the strange illusions that you keep,
you don't know, but I'm noticing. "

999
01:14:14,441 --> 01:14:16,238
- I wrote that.
- You wrote that?

1000
01:14:18,012 --> 01:14:19,309
I love that.

1001
01:14:19,513 --> 01:14:21,538
It wasn't about her.
It wasn't about anybody.

1002
01:14:21,749 --> 01:14:23,512
It was just, you know...

1003
01:14:24,385 --> 01:14:25,852
Would you play it?

1004
01:14:26,053 --> 01:14:29,147
- Right now?
- Yeah, dude. Look where we are.

1005
01:14:29,356 --> 01:14:31,916
- You wanna lay it down?
- Yes.

1006
01:14:32,126 --> 01:14:33,957
- Really?
- Get in there.

1007
01:14:34,161 --> 01:14:36,595
- Really?
- Go. Go for it.

1008
01:14:54,815 --> 01:14:57,409
- Can you hear me?
- Check.

1009
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,548
Yeah. All right.

1010
01:15:03,257 --> 01:15:07,853
<i>I never should've let you drive my car
Because now it's ruined forever</i>

1011
01:15:08,062 --> 01:15:10,690
<i>It was the biggest mistake of my life
To let you drive it</i>

1012
01:15:11,432 --> 01:15:12,729
I'm sorry.

1013
01:15:12,933 --> 01:15:14,525
That's okay. I'm used to it.

1014
01:15:14,735 --> 01:15:17,431
She falls apart
and I put her back together again.

1015
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:18,900
Just like me and Caroline.

1016
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:23,773
It reminds me of this part of Judaism
that I really like.

1017
01:15:23,977 --> 01:15:26,343
<i>It's called Tikkun olam.</i>

1018
01:15:26,547 --> 01:15:29,641
It says that the world's been broken
into pieces...

1019
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:34,344
...and it's everybody's job to find them
and put them back together again.

1020
01:15:36,924 --> 01:15:38,892
Well, maybe we're the pieces,
you know?

1021
01:15:39,093 --> 01:15:42,028
Maybe we're not supposed
to find the pieces.

1022
01:15:42,229 --> 01:15:44,094
Maybe we are the pieces.

1023
01:15:48,469 --> 01:15:49,595
Nick?

1024
01:15:50,270 --> 01:15:51,259
Yeah?

1025
01:15:53,407 --> 01:15:54,931
I'm coming in.

1026
01:16:17,331 --> 01:16:18,821
Hi.

1027
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:32,405
I'm not gonna compete
with her, okay?

1028
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:33,903
With who?

1029
01:17:35,542 --> 01:17:38,067
I think Dev has the same bra.

1030
01:17:41,882 --> 01:17:43,543
I just...

1031
01:17:43,917 --> 01:17:47,409
I just, I know I'm not, like,
pretty like that.

1032
01:17:48,055 --> 01:17:50,489
Norah, you're beautiful.

1033
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:00,926
Why is this button so difficult?

1034
01:18:01,134 --> 01:18:02,396
Sorry, Nicky.

1035
01:18:02,603 --> 01:18:04,662
- Why would you buy these pants?
- I don't know.

1036
01:18:04,872 --> 01:18:06,999
I just, I don't know.
I can't remember.

1037
01:18:08,442 --> 01:18:10,307
- Cold. Cold hands.
- Sorry.

1038
01:18:10,511 --> 01:18:12,741
Why are your hands so cold?

1039
01:18:51,852 --> 01:18:53,149
You okay?

1040
01:18:53,353 --> 01:18:56,220
Yeah, it's just a little embarrassing.

1041
01:18:57,591 --> 01:19:00,560
Don't be embarrassed.
You're beautiful.

1042
01:19:07,534 --> 01:19:09,968
It's my phone. Sorry.

1043
01:19:14,441 --> 01:19:15,465
Nick?

1044
01:19:15,676 --> 01:19:16,802
What?

1045
01:19:17,110 --> 01:19:19,340
How do you feel about Where's Fluffy?

1046
01:19:21,848 --> 01:19:23,748
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1047
01:19:23,951 --> 01:19:26,545
- Okay. Oh, hurry up.
- We have to hurry. Hurry, hurry.

1048
01:19:26,753 --> 01:19:29,517
I am, I am, I am. Oh, my God.

1049
01:19:30,457 --> 01:19:32,015
Oh, shoes.

1050
01:19:32,225 --> 01:19:34,193
Okay, hang on.

1051
01:19:34,628 --> 01:19:38,223
Okay. I'm ready. Okay, go.

1052
01:20:17,371 --> 01:20:23,674
- Norah! You're here. I'm so happy.
- What are you doing here?

1053
01:20:24,211 --> 01:20:26,736
- How's it going?
- I'm never drinking again. I promise.

1054
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:28,505
- Hey, Norah.
- Okay.

1055
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:30,944
What are you doing?

1056
01:20:32,386 --> 01:20:33,580
You asshole.

1057
01:20:34,354 --> 01:20:36,618
Wait, you show up here
with this gaylord?

1058
01:20:36,823 --> 01:20:39,724
You trying to make a fool of me
in front of my boys?

1059
01:20:39,926 --> 01:20:43,225
<i>Do you realize that I had to walk back
to 10th by myself?</i>

1060
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:45,660
- You weren't exactly by yourself.
- Shut up, Gary.

1061
01:20:45,866 --> 01:20:48,960
- So you're telling me this is over?
- You're seriously over me?

1062
01:20:49,569 --> 01:20:52,538
Come on, no.

1063
01:20:52,739 --> 01:20:54,001
Come here a second.

1064
01:20:54,775 --> 01:20:56,037
Come on.

1065
01:20:56,276 --> 01:20:58,938
You're still gonna give your dad
our CD, right? Aren't you?

1066
01:20:59,146 --> 01:21:02,946
Come on, you know how hard we
worked on that. You promised me...

1067
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:05,775
Wait. It's all good. It's all good.

1068
01:21:08,155 --> 01:21:11,056
This doesn't concern you, Sal.

1069
01:21:13,126 --> 01:21:14,753
Well, anyway, so...

1070
01:21:14,995 --> 01:21:17,395
- It's Salvatore.
- Oh, yeah?

1071
01:21:18,298 --> 01:21:20,232
What, you blew it
with your own chick...

1072
01:21:20,434 --> 01:21:23,198
...so you gotta run around
playing beard with someone else's?

1073
01:21:23,403 --> 01:21:24,768
- If you push me again...
- What?

1074
01:21:24,971 --> 01:21:28,236
- Your merry men will bone me?
- That's it.

1075
01:21:34,114 --> 01:21:35,911
Leave her. She'll go running to Daddy.

1076
01:21:36,116 --> 01:21:39,552
Come on, come with me.
Just come with me.

1077
01:21:41,455 --> 01:21:43,616
- Come on.
- Come on, come with me.

1078
01:21:44,124 --> 01:21:46,092
Let's go watch the show.

1079
01:22:16,523 --> 01:22:19,117
<i>Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy!</i>

1080
01:22:46,753 --> 01:22:49,654
That's three years I've wasted
on Ira Silverberg's daughter...

1081
01:22:49,856 --> 01:22:51,483
...and what does it get me?

1082
01:22:51,691 --> 01:22:54,216
Norah, who's gonna take me home?

1083
01:22:54,427 --> 01:22:56,657
Yeah, well, I hate your stupid band.

1084
01:22:56,863 --> 01:22:58,797
Oh, and P.S., I cheated on you.

1085
01:22:58,999 --> 01:23:01,297
- Go away.
- Shut up.

1086
01:23:02,068 --> 01:23:03,057
Let's go.

1087
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:07,969
<i>Don't leave yet, because we've got
one question for you: Are you ready...</i>

1088
01:23:08,175 --> 01:23:11,941
<i>...for Where's Fluffy?</i>

1089
01:23:12,145 --> 01:23:15,376
I love you, New York.

1090
01:23:27,227 --> 01:23:28,717
Hey, what's wrong?

1091
01:23:29,462 --> 01:23:30,895
Are you sad we missed it?

1092
01:23:31,932 --> 01:23:34,423
We didn't miss it. This is it.

1093
01:23:36,336 --> 01:23:38,270
Come on. Don't you wanna go home??
