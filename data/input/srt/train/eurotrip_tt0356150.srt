1
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,890
Euro Trip

2
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:48,260
Congratulations,
Hudson High Class of 2004.

3
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,280
There she is. Fiona!

4
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,620
Bye.

5
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,020
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey!

6
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,200
- Hey, you.

7
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,690
- Congratulations, graduate.
- Thanks, baby.

8
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,530
And congratulations to you, Cooper.

9
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,330
Aww. Thanks, baby!

10
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,550
- Nice try.

11
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,550
- All right. - See you at Wade's party tonight?

12
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,220
- See you then.
Alright

13
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,390
So, it's just you and me
for the entire summer.

14
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,680
Next year you graduate, join me
at college.

15
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,060
Just like we planned.

16
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,550
- Scott, we need to talk.
- Yeah? About what?

17
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,980
About me dumping you.

18
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,220
Huh?

19
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,600
There he is!

20
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,410
The graduate
and his beautiful girlfriend. OK?

21
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,160
Smile, you two!

22
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,330
- Action!
- Dad, Mom, Grandma...

23
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,230
Uncle Moke... uh...

24
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,620
I'm gonna need a minute here, OK?

25
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,670
What do you mean,
you're dumping me?

26
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,250
I just can't take all the

27
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,760
lying
and cheating on each other anymore.

28
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,710
What are you talking about?
Sweetie, I never cheated on you.

29
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,850
I know. That's what makes this so hard.

30
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,680
You're looking good, you guys.

31
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,930
Scotty, it's not you.

32
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,180
It's me.

33
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,520
There I go, lying again.
No, it was you.

34
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,690
You're just so...

35
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,060
...predictable.
- Smile!

36
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,980
So, that's it.

37
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,870
Here's your letter jacket back.

38
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,450
Goodbye.

39
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,290
This isn't mine.

40
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:43,460
She's a keeper, huh?
Oh, wow.

41
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,660
Oh, my God.

42
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,330
Fiona!

43
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,840
Let's see that again.

44
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,260
Fiona!

45
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,960
- This is just so brutal.

46
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,350
And yet I can't look away.
Bert, play it again. Come on.

47
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,570
- Fiona!
- Bert, get out of here.

48
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,770
OK.See you.

49
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,640
All right. Stay black, Bert.

50
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,650
"Fiona!"

51
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,700
Mail, motherfucker!

52
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,620
Hey, I got one from Mieke.

53
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,870
"Happy Herzlichen."

54
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,210
Still writing that guy?
I thought that was for German class.

55
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,380
Yeah at first, but we're
actually becoming good friends.

56
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,520
He's a really cool guy.

57
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:44,020
"Dear Mieke, greetings
from your American pen pal."

58
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,670
Scotty, Girl Scouts have pen pals.

59
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,860
Listen to yourself, all right?

60
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,010
You met a "cool guy" on the "internet."

61
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,280
This is how these sexual predators work.

62
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:57,200
Next thing you know,
he'll want to "arrange a meeting"

63
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,400
where he will gas you,
stuff you in the back of his van,

64
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,360
and make a wind chime
out of your genitals.

65
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,380
Come on, let's go to Wade's.

66
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,240
All right.
Screw it. Let's go.

67
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,130
I'm not gonna let Fiona
ruin my graduation night.

68
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,130
Auf wiedersehen, Mieke.

69
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,520
- What's up, losers?
- What's up, Jenny?

70
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,850
What's up, dude?

71
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,020
Sorry to hear about Fiona.
She's a whore.

72
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,990
That's very sweet of you.
Thanks.

73
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,560
Enough Fiona talk.

74
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,770
Look around.
There's gotta be 100 drunk girls.

75
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,780
We should try to have sex
with every one of 'em.

76
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,000
Hello? Mixed company?

77
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,530
What?

78
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,450
- I'm a girl!
- No, you're not.

79
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,200
- You're just a cool guy with long hair.

80
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,290
- So, where's your evil twin brother?

81
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,250
Jenny!

82
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,790
There he is.

83
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,180
Hey, Jamie.
In fine form, I see.

84
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,580
Why'd you get me
gin and tonic?

85
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,270
- I hate gin.
- You do?

86
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,140
You guys are the worst twins ever!

87
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,560
Chug! Chug!

88
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,810
- When are you guys taking off?
- Tomorrow morning.

89
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,860
Hey, Wade!
Great party, buddy.

90
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,430
Man, I am so excited!

91
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,950
A whole summer,
backpacking around Europe.

92
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,490
You should've come with us

93
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,910
instead of
working for Dr. Dad, Scotty!

94
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,210
It's gonna be so awesome!

95
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,670
Yeah. I planned every detail of the trip
to maximize the fun!

96
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,800
You brought a guidebook to a party?

97
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,950
- Do you wanna see my itinerary?
- Do you wanna see my balls?

98
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,510
You guys decide where
you're gonna go first?

99
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,260
Paris! I can't wait.

100
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,630
Two years ago Nicky Jager's sister,
Debbie

101
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,100
met a wealthy French guy,

102
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,100
and spent a month sailing
the Mediterranean on his yacht.

103
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,150
Isn't that the most romantic
thing you've ever heard?

104
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,990
Stuck on a boat with a weird French guy?

105
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,860
That sounds a little gay.

106
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,160
It's not gay. I'm a girl.

107
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,000
- Kinda gay.
- A little gay.

108
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,080
I gotta piss like a pregnant woman.

109
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,840
Hey, listen up, everybody.

110
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,420
Gotta a little special thing
I'd like to do tonight.

111
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,960
Going to play
a little song for you

112
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:25,350
about the nastiest, freakiest
little sex puppet I know...

113
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,170
Fiona.

114
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,230
This one's for you, baby.
Happy anniversary.

115
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:46,150
" Scotty doesn't know
That Fiona and me

116
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,870
" Do it in my van every Sunday

117
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,660
" She tells him she's in church
But she doesn't go

118
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,790
" Still she's on her knees
And Scotty doesn't know

119
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,970
" Oh, Scotty doesn't know

120
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,890
" So don't tell Scotty
Scotty doesn't know

121
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,220
" Scotty doesn't know "

122
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,870
I hope we're just as popular
in college

123
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,540
as we were in high school.

124
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,260
- We will be.
- I know.

125
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,380
Who needs more Chablis?

126
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,520
- Candy, wanna come with?
- No, I'll stay here.

127
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,570
Hello Candy!

128
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,220
- Whoops!

129
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,080
Holy cow!

130
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,780
Oh, this isn't where
I parked my car!

131
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,170
" I can't believe
He's so trusting

132
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,840
" While I'm right behind you thrusting

133
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,620
" 'Cause Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know "

134
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,510
Cooper Harris, you're a pig!

135
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,600
Uh... Candy, before you go

136
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,600
you might wanna clean that off

137
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,420
Clean what off?

138
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,640
It's like a dirt or something...
just go like this...

139
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,280
No... It's kind of under...
and to the side

140
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,530
under

141
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Is this off?

142
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,700
I think that your top is getting in the way

143
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,650
Really?
Trust me

144
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,280
That's better...
Keep rubbing it

145
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,810
" I did it with her on his birthday

146
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,630

149
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,660
Mmm-hmm... mmm-hmm...

150
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,470
No, it's just not coming off.

151
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,310
What is it?

152
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,910
- Fine, I'll do it.
Come here.

153
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,670
Oh, my God! Candy!

154
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,450
Cooper!

155
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,420
Hey...

156
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,490
This isn't where I parked my car.

157

" Scotty doesn't know

- Yeah!

164
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,710
Mail, motherfucker!

165
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,430
Hey, Mieke.

166
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,930
Hey, Mieke.

167
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,770
"I was very sad

168
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,520
to hear about
your lady woman Fiona dumping you.

169
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,660
"Since you no longer have a girlfriend,

170
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,240
maybe I could come to America

171
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,240
"and we could get to know each
other better.

172
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,900
Perhaps we could...

173
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,070
"Zussamen."

174
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,230
What the fuck is "zussamen"?

175
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,580
"Arrange a meeting."

176
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,550
No, no, no! Come on!
Cooper was right.

177
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,720
This guy wants to have sex with me

178
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,420
"Listen, Mieke...

179
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:42,190
"I don't want to arrange
any meetings with you,

180
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,920
"you sick, German freak.

181
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,280
"So please keep your hands
off my genitals,

182
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,400
"and never write to me again,

183
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,430
and don't come to America."

184
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,770
"Goodbye."

185
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,120
Oww.

186
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:18,470
I'm never drinking again.
Oh, that's nice.

187
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,760
Bert, what are you doing?

188
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,480
Reading your email.

189
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,570
Don't do that.

190
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,120
Why are you wearing my bathrobe?

191
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,160
Oh, I'm sorry...

192
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,660
but somebody pissed
all over mine last night.

193
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,830
Wow. I can't believe this German chick

194
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,880
wants to come here and hook up with you.

195
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,450
I don't think so, buddy.
Mieke's a guy.

196
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,950
No, it says right here,

197
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,500
"Trauriges m dchen."

198
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,220
"I was a sad girl to hear about Fiona."

199
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:55,230
I'm taking "Intro to German,"
and even I know that.

200
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,560
Come here.

201
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,800
He sent me a picture, retardo.

202
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:02,640
See? That's a picture of Mieke
and his cute cousin, Jan.

203
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,350
No, retardo.

204
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,860
That's Jan, a man's name,

205
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,320
and that's not "Mike,"

206
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,280
it's "Mieke," a common
German girl's name,

207
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,160
similar to our Michelle.

208
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,830
I hope you wrote her back
and told her to come visit.

209
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,500
You didn't?

210
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,840
You thought she was a guy!

211
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,010
I'm getting the video camera! Ha!

212
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,830
What an asshole!

213
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,460
No.

214
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,710
No.

215
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,000
No.

216
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,220
"Address blocked"?
"Email not delivered."

217
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,420
No... come on!!

218
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,720
Hey, Mom made waffles.

219
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:17,260
- What's going on?
- I'm in love with my penpal.

220
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,260
I'm in love with Mieke.

221
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,350
OK... OK.

222
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,440
You know what?
I was actually expecting this.

223
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,720
And frankly.. No listen...

224
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,440
I'm flattered that
you picked me to come out to first.

225
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,700
And don't worry about
telling your folks, 'cause...

226
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,660
- I think they already know.
- No, you idiot. Mike is a girl.

227
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,170
No, no, I get it. Yeah.

228
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,080
He's the girl, and you're the girl,

229
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,000
and sometimes you're both the girl.

230
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,790
Right?

231
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,240
Right? That's hot.

232
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,600
But you know... whatever works for you.
I'm not gonna judge it.

233
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,800
Will you stop? Look, come here.
Look at this picture.

234
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,920
Wow. Who's the hot chick?

235
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,090
That's "Mike." I mean, Mieke.

236
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,110
That's Mieke? That's who you've been writing to
all this time?

237
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,310
No! Until last night,
when I took your advice

238
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:10,150
and told her to keep her
"hands off my genitals."

239
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:14,030
Given what we know now, that seems like
the exact opposite of what you want.

240
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,490
This is a total disaster.

241
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,620
Oh, come on. It's not that bad.

242
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,110
Though she is really hot.

243
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,460
You're not listening.
I don't even care what she looks like.

244
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,830
Mieke and I had this incredible bond.

245
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,080
I told her things
I couldn't even tell you.

246
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,050
Like what?

247
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,170
- Nothing. It's a figure of speech.

248
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,090
- No, seriously. What?
- Nothing. The point...

249
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,060
- You like me better, right?
Would ya stop.. listen

250
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:45,393
This girl is not only smart and funny,
and stunningly beautiful,

251
00:16:45,394 --> 00:16:45,460
but

252
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,520
until I screwed up, she actually wanted to

253
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,770
to come all the way to America just to be with me.

254
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,970
- So do something about it.
- What can I do?

255
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,410
She blocked her email account,
her phone number's not listed.

256
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,580
The only thing I know
is she lives in Berlin.

257
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,110
So go to Berlin.

258
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,950
I can't just go to Berlin, Coop.

259
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,090
- Why not?
- Because...

260
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,090
I just can't, OK?

261
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,870
I'm supposed
to work for my dad this summer.

262
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,260
It looks good on
my med school application.

263
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,180
Oh, Jesus, Scotty!

264
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,350
Man, Fiona was right.
You're so predictable.

265
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,340
- I'm going to Germany.
- No...

266
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,780
We're going to Germany.

267
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,400
How are we going
to get to Germany?

268
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,020
Don't worry. I've got it covered.

269
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,830
- We're going to be couriers?

270
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,630
- Best way to get a cheap flight.

271
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,550
All we have to carry their packages,
then

272
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,300
drop them off when we get there.

273
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,970
- My cousin did it going to India.

274
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,340
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

275
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:59,890
Of course, he ended up using
a public restroom in New Delhi

276
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,430
and they had to cut off his leg.
You know...

277
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,230
but he got there cheap,
is what I'm saying.

278
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:09,520
OK, I don't have anything
to Germany for a week.

279
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:13,720
But I can get you both
to London today for $118.

280
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,410
Anything else?
Europe is the size of the Eastwood Mall.

281
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,570
We can walk to Berlin from there.

282
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,990
- Cooper, England's an island.

283
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,080
- OK, swim. Whatever.

284
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,610
We'll take it.

285
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,910
Hey.

286
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,600
Thanks for coming with me.

287
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,920
I know you had that internship
at the law firm this summer.

288
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,350
Well, forget about the law firm.

289
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,140
And don't thank me.
I should be thanking you.

290
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,190
This trip is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me

291
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,200
to broaden my sexual horizons.

292
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,700
What are you talking about?

293
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,030
I'm talking about crazy European sex.

294
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,570
Ah.

295
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,660
You know America was founded by prudes.
b?i nh?ng ngu?i dàn bà doan trang.

296
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,240
Prudes who left Europe,
because they hated

297
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:14,500
it all the kinky, steamy
European sex that was going on.

298
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:18,120
And now I, Cooper Harris,

299
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,250
will return to the land
of my perverted forefathers

300
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,960
and claim my birthright,
which is a

301
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:28,630
series of erotic and sexually
challenging adventures.

302
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:33,650
You've really thought a lot
about this, haven't you?

303
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,480
It's my passion.

304
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,080
Come on, come on!

305
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,820
- The adventure begins.

306
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,670
- Welcome to jolly old England.

307
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,290
Yeah, breathe that sweet,
sexy, European air.

308
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,300
- Oh.
- What is that?

309
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,930
It's the phone they gave me
at the law firm.

310
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,640
Yeah, it's pretty neat, huh?

311
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,390
- Works anywhere.
- Yeah?

312
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,170
Excuse me.

313
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,110
Cooper here.

314
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,110
Hello, Mr. Walters.

315
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,310
Yes, sir, I'm down in file storage.

316
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,200
Um, hang on one second.

317
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,540
No, sir, I can't find
the Gutterman file anywhere.

318
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,290
Yes, sir, I'll keep looking.

319
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,190
I don't rest until I find it.

320
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,630
Didn't tell your boss
you were leaving the country?

321
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,130
They would've stopped paying me.
It seemed easier.

322
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,500
- So, where to?
- I don't know.

323
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,590
First bus to Berlin doesn't leave
till tomorrow.

324
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,010
What do you wanna do?
Got the Tower of London...

325
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,540
there's Buckingham Palace.

326
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,730
- Uh...
- There's no drinking age.

327
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,680
Ði thôi!
Kh?n truong nào.

328
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,850
- Hey!"The Fiesty Goat."

329
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,220
All right!

330
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,110
What do you wanna...

331
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:21,010
Soccer hooligans.

332
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,050
Hey, this isn't where
I parked my car!

333
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,380
Oy!

334
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,580
Who the bloody hell are you?

335
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,470
This is a private members bar,

336
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,020
exclusively for the supporters

337
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,940
of the greatest
football team in the world...

338
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,600
Manchester United.

339
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:46,870
Now please, enlighten me.

340
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,450
Who the fuck are you?!

341
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,270
That is a good question,

342
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,450
and... Scotty?

343
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,110
Huh?

344
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,610
We're the Manchester United fan club...

345
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,450
from Ohio.

346
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,250
If you're Manchester United
supporters...

347
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,000
sing the Manchester United song.

348
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,840
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

349
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,470
I'm not much of a singer...

350
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,480
- Sing!!
" My baby takes

351
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,630
? " The morning train ?

352
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:21,900
? " He works from 9 to 5 and then he ?

353
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:25,770
? " takes another home again ?

354
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,240
? " To find me... ?

355
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:33,530
? " watching the Manchester United
football team! " ?

356
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,150
Eh?

357
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,700
The best freakin' team
in all the land! Whoo-hoo!

358
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,680
Pretty good.

359
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,010
- Pretty dang good, lads!
- Yeah!

360
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,940
? " My baby takes the morning train ?

361
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:06,060
? " He works from 9 to 5 and then ?

362
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:09,700
? " He takes another home again ?

363
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:13,570
? " To find me waiting for him ?

364
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:18,160
? " He's always
on that morning train " ?

365
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,080
I've unblocked
your email address,

366
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,130
but this Scott is not responding.

367
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,390
He was the one.

368
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,640
I was going to give myself to him.

369
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:38,680
Perhaps you should give
yourself to someone else...

370
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,880
Frulein.

371
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:07,070
I'm never drinking again.

372
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,710
Coop, wake up.

373
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,430
Oh, man, that was a wild night.

374
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:15,760
You think?

375
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,470
Scotty, where the hell are we going?

376
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,890
Don't worry. If anything
bad happens

377
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,480
my parents will find us.

378
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,560
Honey, where's Scotty?

379
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:35,570
- Cooper said they were going camping.

380
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,570
- Oh, that's nice.

381
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,440
And where's Bert?

382
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,790
Fuck if I know.

383
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:55,470
Hey!
How are you, you scalawag!

384
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,010
Look, given the current
geopolitical climate,

385
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:01,180
all European countries should
have a seat at the table.

386
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,800
- Right.
- Except those fucking Ities.

387
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:06,130
I hate them Italian bastards.

388
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,130
- You know what I mean?
-

389
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,570
Hello, boyo!

390
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,400
- What the hell happened last night?

391
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,860
- You got steamed up, pissed as a fart.
.

392
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,690
Too much sauce, son.

393
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,030
Don't worry.

394
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,980
We come and got ya,
so you wouldn't miss the trip.

395
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,860
What trip?

396
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,480
- Where are we going?

397
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,200
- What do you mean, where are we going?

398
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,340
We're going to see the Mighty
Reds do the frogs in Paris.

399
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,320
Aren't we, boys?

400
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:32,090
Yeah!

401
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,830
Why are you yelling at me?

402
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,490
So I tell the swamp donkey
to sock it

403
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:39,350
before I give her a trunky
in the tradesman's entrance

404
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,830
and have her lick me yardballs!

405
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,500
Wow.

406
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,610
You guys are on a completely
different level of swearing over here.

407
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,690
Coop? Cooper,
we're going to Paris.

408
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,700
I know. Cecil told me.

409
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,350
Mieke's in Berlin.
We're not going to Berlin.

410
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,070
What are we gonna do?
We need a plan.

411
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:01,850
See what I'm talking about?
This is predictable Scotty talking.

412
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:04,820
Relax. Paris is practically a suburb
of Berlin.

413
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,710
It's a nothing commute.

414
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:09,130
That's why France and Germany
have always been allies.

415
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,410
Allies

416
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,370
The twins.
The twins are in Paris, right?

417
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,640
We give 'em a call. They could help us out.
Let me see your phone. I'll give 'em a call

418
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,890
Alright, but I'm only supposed
to use this for business calls.

419
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,760
Hey, don't...

420
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,080
You're on the wrong side of the road,

421
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,060
you snail-eating puffs.

422
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:49,120
Fuck off! Go on, you Gaelic
fucking garlic-breath tossers!

423
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,400
Piss off!
Get in here and say that,

424
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,790
you froggy Itie shities!

425
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:59,090
- Fucking beep!

426
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,250
We'll beep, you bastard,
all over your fucking nose!

427
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,350
Get out of the way! Piss off!

428
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,640
Hey, lads!

429
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:16,360
That wanker's got
a frog football shirt on!

430
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,700
Let's give this nancy
a fucking good kicking!

431
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,320
Come on, lads, he's going off!

432
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,330
All right. Twins said
they'd meet us here.

433
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,340
Look at that!

434
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,220
There they are. Come on. Jenny!

435
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,620
- Jamie!
- Hey!

436
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,620
Come here!

437
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,790
No, no. No, no, no!

438
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,430
- Scott, bienvenu a Paris.
- Thank you.

439
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,130
- What is that? A new camera?
- It isn't just a camera,

440
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,130
This is a Leica M7.

441
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,300
Uber-sensitive exposure settings,

442
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,140
legendary cloth shutter system.

443
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,860
- Let me see that thing.
- No can do.

444
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,980
I spent four years tutoring
lacrosse players to pay for it,

445
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:07,000
so nobody touches my camera but me.

446
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,280
- It's like your wiener.
- No, it's not...

447
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,530
- Jenny...
- Cooper, leave him alone.

448
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:15,090
Wow, I can't believe you came
all the way to Europe for a girl.

449
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,870
Wait, not just any girl.

450
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,660
Show her the picture, Scotty.

451
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:21,430
She makes girls in our high school
look like walruses.

452
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,660
I'm a girl from your high school.

453
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,160
No, I mean "girl" girls.

454
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:28,050
Guys, we're wasting the whole day here.
We're in Paris!

455
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,500
Hãy t?i Vi?n b?o tàng Louvre!

456
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,470
To the Louvre!

457
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:07,590
So, you guys wanna stay here,

458
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:10,710
should we check out
the huge line at the Eiffel Tower?

459
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,210
Here's a fun fact.  Voltaire

460
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,710
contracted
syphilis two blocks from here.

461
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,930
- Should we go?
- Can we please get out of here?

462
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:20,220
- This guy's really creeping me out.
- Who, robot man?

463
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:23,070
He's just trying to feed
his robot family.

464
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,410
- I really don't like him.
- Why?

465
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:28,730
Because he's doing this?

466
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,610
OK, seriously, don't do that.

467
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,000
Cooper.
Do not hate me.

468
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,870
I am familiar with
over 600 dance moves

469
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,070
and I am programmed to get...

470
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,340
freaky.

471
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:00,690
You're just upset because
people like me better.

472
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,690
It's okay.

473
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,500
Oh!

474
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,100
Fight! Fight!

475
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,770
Break the leg shot!

476
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,420
Ha! Ha! Ha!

477
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,540
Don't look in his eyes, Scotty.

478
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,430
- Ohhh!
- That was not cool.

479
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,440
Ha! Ha! Ha!

480
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,290
Arghhhhh!

481
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:44,410
Oh!

482
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,330
Guys, let's go. Come on.

483
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:56,730
Error! Error! Error!

484
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:59,560
How cool is this?

485
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:02,380
It's a shame we only get
to spend one day together.

486
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,900
Why don't you come to Berlin?
- Umm, no.

487
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:08,100
Jamie, come on. In a few months,
we go to different colleges.

488
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:12,110
This could be the last chance the four
of us are together like this.

489
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,060
Plus, we're in Europe. Huh?

490
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:16,240
This should be the trip of a lifetime.

491
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,450
There's no way we should split up.

492
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:22,170
All right, this table
is now Europe, OK?

493
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,500
Excuse me.

494
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:27,840
We are right here, in Paris,

495
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:30,090
and I have got to get to Mieke,

496
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,590
who is over here, in Berlin.

497
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,630
And Jamie...If you come with us,
I'm sure there's a

498
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,930
ton of great stuffs that you could see along the way.

499
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:40,850
- We can go to Denmark.
- I love Denmark.

500
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,440
- We gotta hit Amsterdam.
- Definitely.

501
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,440
And the cathedral at Cameret!

502
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,610
- Yeah...
- Maybe. We'll see.

503
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,150
- Whatever.
- If there's time.

504
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,270
Come on! I really want you
to be there when I meet Mieke.

505
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,240
Fine.

506
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,960
- Excellent!
- All right!

507
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:03,110
- A toast!
- Yes!

508
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,290
- To Mieke!
- To Europe!

509
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,800
To Europe!

510
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,550
Merci.

511
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,550
- Berlin, here we come!
- All right.

512
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,220
you better let me hold onto those.

513
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:22,230
- What the hell is that?
- It's a traveler's money belt.

514
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:24,600
Frommer's says
if you have one of these,

515
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,400
no one can rob you of anything.

516
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,980
Except your dignity.

517
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,640
No, you just put that in your...

518
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:32,020
wait, what?

519
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,520
Come on, guidebook. Let's go.

520
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,580
Check it out.

521
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,160
European ass.

522
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,830
What's up?

523
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:51,040
Jesus, Jenny.
I thought you were some...

524
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,760
girl. Come on. Platform 4.

525
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,960
Thanks.

526
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:58,550
Damn!

527
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,390
I believe this is yours.

528
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,720
Pleased to meet you.

529
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:11,360
My name is Christoph.

530
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,230
- Jenny, let's go!
- Move it!

531
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:17,620
Those are my friends.
We're supposed to go to Berlin...

532
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,900
- Jenny!
- I'm coming!!

533
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:23,410
So, it was really nice
to meet you.

534
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:25,410
The pleasure was all mine...

535
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,960
Jennifer.

536
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:15,420
" Scotty doesn't know
That Fiona and me "

537
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:18,430
" Do it in my van on Sundays "

538
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,930
" Tells him she's... "
What?

539
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:24,470
You gotta admit,
it's a really catchy tune.

540
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,850
" Tells him she's in church
But she doesn't go "

541
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,310
" Still she's on her knees
And Scotty doesn't know "

542
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,940
" Scotty doesn't know "

543
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:38,060
- " Scotty doesn't... "
- Buongiorno.

544
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:44,270
Buongiorno.

545
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:54,000
You know, there are a lot
of other empty compartments.

546
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,630
Huh?

547
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,830
Ah! Si...

548
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,500
Si.

549
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,850
Pardon me.

550
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,050
Eh?

551
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,020
Ohhh...

552
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,570
Scusi.

553
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,610
Mi scusi.

554
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,420
Hi.

555
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,140
Buongiorno.

556
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:25,450
- What the hell are you doing?
- Mi scusi, mi scusi.

557
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,870
No! No, no, no!

558
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,040
- Uh-oh.
- What?

559
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,130
Big tunnel.

560
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:39,300
Who's touching me?
Scotty, is that you?

561
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,250
Ai s? mó tao th??!
Scotty!

562
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,350
Oh!

563
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,230
Mi Scusi.

564
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,280
Crans Sur Mer.
We change trains here.

565
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,750
Well, we got a couple
of hours to kill.

566
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,500
What's there to see in this town?

567
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:19,660
Hello? The Monument des Poissonieres.

568
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:22,990
It's a monument to all the local
fishermen who were lost at sea.

569
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:26,180
Frommer's says it's supposed
to be..."quite moving."

570
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:29,100
What the hell is wrong with you, C-3PO?

571
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:32,000
We're here to see Europe,
not some crappy statue.

572
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:34,060
I'm taking a nap.

573
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,190
Wake me up when the train gets here.

574
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,440
Hmm. Says here this town
has a famous nude beach.

575
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:42,060
All right, we can't all
just lie around all day.

576
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:44,950
We gotta get out there and experience
the culture firsthand.

577
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,400
Let's go exploring!

578
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,490
So, what's the etiquette on boners?

579
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,410
Do I roll over and dig out
a hole for it,

580
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:57,550
or is it cool to just let my flag fly?

581
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:00,130
Wait, wait.

582
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,750
Does "nude beach" mean
we have to get naked, too?

583
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,540
Of course.

584
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,000
Do you think you can go an hour

585
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,210
without your currency colostomy bag?

586
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,480
Hey! Hey! As long as this thing has
our money and passports in it,

587
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:15,150
it's not coming off, and
my trunks won't come off, either.

588
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:16,480
Come on, Jamie

589
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,720
You came all the way to Europe.

590
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,600
Can't wimp out now.

591
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,820
OK.

592
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,660
All right, on the count of three.

593
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,820
Here we go.

594
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:28,490
3,2,1...

595
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,360
Look at Jamie's penis!

596
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,250
Very funny. Very funny.

597
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,570
All right.

598
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:39,240
Let the crazy European
sex odyssey begin.

599
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,290
- Here we go.
- Really?

600
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:41,840
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

601
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:48,510
- Hello, ladies!

602
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,800
- Ladies?
- Bitches?

603
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:59,860
Eww! What a rip!
There's no nude girls here,

604
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,060
Just guys like us
looking for nude girls.

605
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,360
I don't understand.

606
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:07,700
"Crans Sur Mer has one of the best
nude beaches on the continent.

607
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,270
"However...

608
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,460
"during the summer,
the European women

609
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,790
"are chased away
by gawking male tourists,

610
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,130
"so Europe's most nubile exhibitionists

611
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,910
head to the deserted beach

612
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,300
" right next to the Monument des Poissonieres."

613
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:42,300
There's so many penises.

614
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:45,820
Frommer's tried to tell you,
but you just didn't listen.

615
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,160
This is the biggest
sausage fest on earth.

616
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,740
It's the international house of sausage.

617
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,160
Hey!

618
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:57,030
- Thanks for waiting.
- You're not missing anything.

619
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,580
It's all guys.

620
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:01,590
At least the sun's out.

621
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:08,710
?  Dreams come true  ?

622
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,390
?  I made my dreams come true  ?

623
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,340
?  My dreams come true  ?

624
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,700
Holy crap!

625
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,790
What? I thought this was a nude beach.

626
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:36,850
No!!!

627
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:42,210
- Huh? No.
- What? What are you doing?

628
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:45,330
- Jenny, you gotta cover up.

629
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,200
Girl?

630
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,380
Girl!

631
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:53,300
Ooh, girl.
Girl... girl.

632
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:56,210
Girl... girl...

633
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,540
Run!

634
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,520
- I'm not gonna make it.

635
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:08,190
- Go on without me.
- All right. See ya.

636
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,360
Chica! Chica!

637
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:23,780
Chica! Chica!

638
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,550
Reading Mieke's old emails again?

639
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,130
Yeah.

640
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,600
I have no idea what I'm going
to say to that girl when I see her.

641
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:47,140
You know, she said
I might be the one?

642
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,690
That's huge.

643
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,230
I've never been "the one" before.

644
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,280
Thought I was "the one" with Fiona,
but turns out I was, what, 101?

645
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:58,900
- 200.
- 200!

646
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:01,290
Look, you got nothing to worry about.

647
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,880
You'll show up and sweep her
off her German feet.

648
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:08,160
Thanks.

649
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:17,640
Yeah.

650
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,840
I will, won't I?

651
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:25,060
I'm so sad and lonely.

652
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:27,760
I just wish someone
would show up

653
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:30,300
and sweep me off
my German feet.

654
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:33,070
Mieke! I'm here.

655
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:34,740
Scotty!

656
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:36,820
About that last email.
I'm so sorry...

657
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:39,990
The past is the past.
You're here now.

658
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,750
I've been saving myself for you.

659
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:47,420
Let us make love
for one whole month.

660
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:53,960
Touch me, Scotty.

661
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,600
OK.

662
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:18,620
Oh, Scott...

663
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,520
- Honey

664
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:23,320
- Honey

665
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:25,860
- Honey

666
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,860
- Honey

667
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:31,910
- Honey

668
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:39,540
Mi scusi.

669
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:46,140
Mi scusi!

670
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:49,480
? " Hot stuff baby this evening " ?

671
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:51,550
? " Gotta have some hot stuff " ?

672
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,650
? " Gotta have some love tonight " ?

673
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,940
? " Hot stuff " ?

674
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,740
Guys, our train
doesn't leave till morning.

675
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,290
- Are we gonna sleep tonight?

676
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,760
- What do you mean, sleep?

677
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,180
We can sleep on the train tomorrow.

678
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:24,250
This is the best that could've happened.
We're in Amsterdam!

679
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,630
This is the drug and
sex capital of Europe!

680
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:28,770
Take a look at this.

681
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,260
"Club Vandersexxx."

682
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:37,400
"The red light district's
hottest sex club."

683
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:40,200
We have to check it out.
Who's with me?

684
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:41,650
I'll go.

685
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:44,620
Fine. Since no one else
is willing to go,

686
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,370
I'll just go myself.

687
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:04,140
? " I see " ?

688
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,670
? " You're waiting for me " ?

689
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:11,560
This is definitely
where I parked my car.

690
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,650
Hello there.

691
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,570
Welcome to Club Vandersexxx...

692
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,570
Amsterdam's most erotic club,

693
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,910
where your every fantasy
will be fulfilled.

694
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,830
Also says I get
a free T-shirt with flyer.

695
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:33,370
He's American.

696
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:38,510
How sad for you to grow up
in a country founded by prudes.

697
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:43,180
A country overrun
with crime and illiteracy.

698
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:45,930
A country where a man
is forced to make sex

699
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,930
to only one woman at a time,

700
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,850
and one must learn
the woman's name beforehand.

701
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:54,520
- It was horrible.
- I know.

702
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:56,670
But you can come with me...

703
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:59,810
and let the Vandersexxx begin.

704
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:07,990
? " Marijuana in my soul " ?

705
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,020
? " Your iguana in my hall " ?

706
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:11,910
I can't believe
we're doing this.

707
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:16,490
Don't worry.
Hash brownies are totally legal here.

708
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:20,530
You're gonna enjoy these, man.
These are magical.

709
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:24,050
" I like to smoke marijuana "

710
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:26,870
- You wanna do this?
- Yeah.

711
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:33,640
- Hi.
- Hi.

712
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:35,850
I need a new battery for my camera,

713
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,270
and while you're at it,
it could use a cleaning.

714
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:39,850
Wow.

715
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,990
Is that a Leica M6?

716
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:44,490
Actually, it's an M7.

717
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,740
It's got the built-in light meter.

718
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,990
It's so beautiful.

719
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:52,410
So sleek, so powerful.

720
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,580
How's the new lens system?

721
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:58,620
Makes the Nikon
look like a disposable.

722
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:01,170
You really know your cameras.

723
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:04,120
And you're very cute.

724
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:06,590
Me? Really?

725
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,880
I'm going on break.

726
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:11,800
I was going to step out back
and have a cigarette.

727
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,550
Would you like to join me?

728
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,350
I don't smoke.

729
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:18,640
Neither do I.

730
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:27,400
Hold on, hold on.

731
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:29,120
What is it?

732
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,700
This is great!

733
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:32,900
You're so innocent.

734
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,870
Let's change that... shall we?

735
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:41,130
What would you like me to do?

736
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,710
Well... I don't really know...

737
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,780
I guess I really
haven't done that much.

738
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:49,620
I haven't really found the time,
with all my extracurriculars,

739
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:53,640
and model U.N., advanced placement
classes, after-school tutor...

740
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:56,340
...ing! Ah!

741
00:48:56,430 --> 00:49:00,010
Gosh, you really like cameras!

742
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:03,980
Sometimes, we find our clients are
so overwhelmed with the pleasure,

743
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:06,800
that they sometimes scream out,"no,"

744
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,690
when really they mean,"yes."

745
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:13,110
And this is why we have the safe word.

746
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,910
The "safe word"?

747
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:19,170
If at any time the ecstasy
gets too great,

748
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,500
you just use the safe word.

749
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:26,010
Until we hear the safe word,
we will not stop.

750
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:28,710
Yeah, right. Stop.
All right.

751
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:31,850
We're going to start slowly,

752
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:36,470
teasing you with a little
light erotic foreplay.

753
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:39,170
Whee!

754
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:41,610
Oh, yes, ladies!

755
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:44,390
On, on, vandersexxx!

756
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:53,620
Hans! Gruber!

757
00:49:57,490 --> 00:49:58,710
Hi.

758
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:12,890
So, are the girls coming back?

759
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:15,590
Administer the testicle clamps!

760
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:17,590
- Huh? What? Hey!

761
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:25,900
Safe word!

762
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:36,110
What is that?!
That's not a word, it's a...

763
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,950
"Fluggen-kliggin-kien?"

764
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:43,470
Fluggen!!!

765
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,160
OK, mister, don't move.
- Excuse me?

766
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,960
Shut the hell up!

767
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,000
Oh, brother! Please don't hurt me.

768
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:58,120
Oh, no... you're fine.
That's good. You're fine.

769
00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:00,250
Give me cash? You got cash?

770
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,550
Take it all, you dirty girl.

771
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:03,950
What?

772
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:06,420
Your wallet! Focus!

773
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:09,790
- Give it to me.
- Oh!

774
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,680
Oh, I love you!

775
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,300
I love you!

776
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:19,070
I love you! I looove you!

777
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:32,950
What's so funny?

778
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:44,510
I'm really hungry.
I think I've got the munchies.

779
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,260
- Excuse me.
- Huh?

780
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:50,970
It's hot in here. You hot?
'Cause I'm really hot.

781
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:53,440
- So good.
- OK, I can't breathe! God!

782
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,010
Tao diên lên dây!

783
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:57,220
I think we got
a bad batch 'cause I'm freaking out.

784
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:59,390
I can't... I can't do this.

785
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:03,030
I saw a gay porno once.
I didn't know until halfway in.

786
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:07,200
The girls never came.
The girls never came!

787
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:10,200
I am freaking out!!

788
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:14,020
- Everything all right with you?
- No, nothing's all right.

789
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,130
You sold us a bad batch
of ash brownies.

790
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:18,200
You're a bad Rastafarian.

791
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:20,860
These are not ash brownies.

792
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,300
Hmm?

793
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,220
- What was that?
- We do not sell hash brownies.

794
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,510
We're a simple Dutch bakery!

795
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,150
Now put your clothes back on, white boy!

796
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,100
Ow! Ow! Ow!

797
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:41,940
"Fluggengegeholen!"

798
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,110
Did you say fluggegecheimen?

799
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:47,240
Yes! Yes!

800
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,940
For the love of god,
fluggengecheimen!

801
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:51,700
Are you sure?

802
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53,000
Yes, please.

803
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:55,200
As you wish.

804
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:58,790
Bring on
the fluggegecheimen!

805
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,120
Wait... what?

806
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:06,180
Uh-oh.

807
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,460
No, no, no!
I didn't say fluggegecheimen,

808
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:10,630
I said, uh...

809
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:32,400
What'd you do last night?

810
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:36,660
I don't want to talk about it.

811
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:38,040
What did you guys do?

812
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:40,290
Don't want to talk about it.

813
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:46,420
- What is that?
- Free T-shirt.

814
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:52,560
Hey, guys.

815
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:55,510
What happened to you?

816
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:57,230
I got robbed.

817
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,480
It was awesome!

818
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:03,400
Our money, passports, tickets...

819
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:05,570
Everything, gone!

820
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,740
How the hell could this happen?

821
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:11,910
We all go to Amsterdam, and
Jamie's the one who hooks up!

822
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,110
For shame!

823
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:26,210
Oh, that's me.

824
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:30,990
Coop here. Sorry.

825
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:33,930
Hello, Mr. Walters..

826
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,520
You never got the Gutterman file?

827
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,520
I told Humphrey to give it to you.

828
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:43,840
That's hogwash. I handed it
to him myself yesterday.

829
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:47,010
I'll tell Humphrey to report
to your office immediately.

830
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:49,110
Bye.

831
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,570
This job's killing me.

832
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:06,700
- Uh...
- Let me handle this.

833
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:09,080
I speak bad German.

834
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:35,110
- What did he say?
- He said he's driving.

835
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:36,490
- Oh.
- Something.

836
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,330
Jah.

837
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:43,200
Berlin?

838
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,850
Berlin?
Berlin!

839
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:02,390
- He's going to Berlin!
- Awesome!

840
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:16,100
- All right! Berlin!
- Come on, let's go!

841
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:18,450
Next stop, Berlin!

842
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,840
Beautiful!
We made it to Berlin.

843
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:45,980
Jah. Berlin!

844
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,650
- Bratislava?
- Yeah.

845
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:54,740
Bratislava!

846
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:03,500
Dear sweet mother of God.

847
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:05,650
We're in Eastern Europe.

848
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,420
Eww!

849
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,020
Excuse me.

850
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:29,770
Do you speak any English?

851
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,840
You are Americans?

852
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:34,230
Yeah.

853
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:36,230
I love America.

854
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,570
We just get "Miami Vice" on television.

855
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:43,950
Amen!
"Miami Vice" is number one new show.

856
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:45,360
Yeah.

857
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:49,040
Listen, we're trying
to get to Berlin, Germany.

858
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:51,380
Do you know if there's
a train coming anytime soon?

859
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:55,000
Oh, yes, very soon.
They are building it now.

860
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:01,370
Stop! Hammer time!

861
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:03,640
Enjoy Bratislava!

862
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:06,090
It's good you came in summer.

863
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:10,600
In winter, it can get very depressing.

864
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,820
We gotta figure something out.
How much money do we have?

865
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:20,860
Frommer's travel tip.

866
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:23,940
I don't have anything.

867
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:26,360
What? I got noth... fine.

868
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,670
$1.83 American.

869
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:37,540
What are we gonna get with that?

870
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:46,880
Gotta love that exchange rate!

871
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:49,520
Ta.

872
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,190
Dinner is served

873
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:56,760
Would the masters care
for anything else?

874
00:58:56,810 --> 00:58:58,610
Think we're good. Thanks.

875
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:02,730
Ah! A nickel!

876
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:06,070
You see this?

877
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:10,490
- I quit!

878
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:13,290
I open my own hotel!

879
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:23,450
So, we got 27 cents left.

880
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,670
What is there to do in this town?

881
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:35,520
? - " My Scotty "
- " Scotty, Scotty " ?

882
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:39,240
? " Scotty doesn't know " ?

883
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,240
? " Don't tell Scotty " ?

884
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:45,240
? - " Scotty doesn't know " ?

885
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:47,360
This song sounds familiar.

886
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:53,580
Jenny, lemme check your coat.

887
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,990
- Hey!
- Jenny!

888
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:03,340
That outfit is horrible!
Just take it off... now!

889
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:08,210
No, but I will let you
buy me a drink.

890
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:09,550
Excuse me!

891
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:14,170
You are the woman from the Paris
train station, aren't you?

892
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:16,010
- My name is...
- Christoph.

893
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:17,690
Yes.

894
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,390
What are you doing here?

895
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:23,560
This is my place. My family owns
many nightclubs in Europe.

896
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:25,980
I'd be honored if you'd join me
in my V.I.P.Room for a drink.

897
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:27,950
Mmm-kay.

898
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,660
Bye, Cooper.

899
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:41,210
- What's that?
- It's absinthe.

900
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,220
Frommer's says it's
illegal in the States

901
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:45,890
because it makes you
hallucinate and go crazy.

902
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:48,170
They call it "the green fairy."

903
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:57,850
My family has a yacht in the Aegean.

904
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:01,230
Come with me, Jennifer.
We will sail away together.

905
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,270
Oh, my God!

906
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:06,570
We will swim with dolphins,
and sip champagne by moonlight.

907
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:09,240
Oh, my God!

908
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:12,330
We will spend the day
sunbathing, drinking wine.

909
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,700
My wife makes the best sangria.

910
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:16,700
Wait... what?

911
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:18,340
Sangria.

912
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,120
You take a good Spanish Rioja,

913
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,410
and you put in slices of orange, and...

914
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:25,130
No, wait.
You said you were married?

915
01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:30,080
You go around Europe
sleeping with every woman you meet?

916
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:32,520
No, please, Jennifer.
It is not like that.

917
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:34,470
I also sleep with men.

918
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,260
I gotta say, I'm not feeling anything.

919
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:42,730
Me neither.

920
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:44,560
Sober as a judge.

921
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:47,360
How 'bout you?

922
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:49,370
Tôi ch?ng c?m th?y chó gì.

923
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:52,100
This absinthe is bullshit!

924
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:53,770
I hear you, my brother.

925
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:55,710
I'm outta here.

926
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:57,240
Excuse me.

927
01:01:57,290 --> 01:02:00,580
- Hey, so where's Christoph?
- Shut up.

928
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:24,180
- Europe!
- Europe!

929
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:27,900
- Whoo!
- Europe!

930
01:02:27,970 --> 01:02:29,470
So, tomorrow, Berlin.

931
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,410
Tomorrow, Mieke!

932
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:39,370
Check it out.

933
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:41,750
No way!

934
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:45,090
Jamie's hooking up with another girl?
Goddamn it!

935
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:48,540
It's just so unfair.
I've been all over,

936
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:51,760
looking for crazy European sex,
and he's the one who ends up getting...

937
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:53,930
- Oh, my God!

938
01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:01,050
That is some pretty fucked-up shit.

939
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:17,320
They really are the worst twins ever.

940
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:19,040
(Both screaming)

941
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:46,600
That was a pretty wild night, eh?

942
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:50,490
Yep. Pretty wild, pretty wild.

943
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:54,990
I know I was out of control.

944
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:56,580
How about you guys?
Did you...?

945
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:59,500
All right, look.
We were really drunk,

946
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:02,000
và làm vài vi?c diên r?,
và Jamie...

947
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:04,950
kissed me.

948
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,870
Let's just forget about it, 'kay?

949
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:09,340
OK, fine. I'll give it a rest.

950
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:15,090
Jamie, could I borrow your Frommer's?

951
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:20,930
Oh, here it is. Bratislava.

952
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:23,300
Hmm. Capital of Slovakia.

953
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:25,560
Oh, here's a fun fact.

954
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:28,860
You made out with your sister, man!

955
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:32,060
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
- Like two dogs in heat.

956
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,200
My friends, where is the beef?

957
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:43,160
You go to Berlin?
I'm your ride.

958
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,710
Hop in.

959
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:51,950
" "99 Red Balloons"

960
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,240
Okay. This is Mieke's
apartment building.

961
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:16,540
Wish me all sorts of luck, guys.

962
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:19,690
You'll do great, Scotty.

963
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:23,380
Thanks.

964
01:05:43,350 --> 01:05:46,990
I came all this way.
I'm not gonna miss this.

965
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:55,780
- Dude, Mieke's hideous! Run!
- Stop.

966
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,660
Hi, my name is Scott Thomas.

967
01:06:09,710 --> 01:06:11,930
I'm from America,
and I'm here to see Mieke.

968
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,430
I'm sorry, but Mieke's not here.

969
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:15,930
Do you know where she is?

970
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,050
She's gone for the summer.

971
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:36,200
My daughter had intended
to spend the summer in America,

972
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,190
looking at colleges
visiting some friends.

973
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,990
But several days ago,
she suddenly changed her mind.

974
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,960
She would not tell me why.

975
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:46,130
I think I know why.

976
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:54,800
This is Heinrich.
He's Mieke's stepbrother.

977
01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:57,920
As I was saying,
she packed up her bag and left.

978
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:01,290
- It was all very sudden.
- Do you know where she is now?

979
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:04,100
As you know she's always been
very interested in the classics,

980
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:06,580
Greek and Roman literature, history,

981
01:07:06,830 --> 01:07:08,360
and she's always enjoyed the ocean,

982
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:11,490
so she found a program that
combines all her interests.

983
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,220
Do you know where she is?

984
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:17,740
She enrolled in a summer at sea
program, based in Rome.

985
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:20,500
Rome.

986
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,250
OK, then I guess we'll go to Rome, then.

987
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:26,170
Well hold on. Unfortunately, Mieke's only
in Rome for orientation.

988
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:29,510
Tomorrow her group boards a boat
and she'll be gone for the summer.

989
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:32,710
And she'll be quite unreachable.

990
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:35,090
Unreachable.

991
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:45,050
Mieke's tour group goes
to the Vatican tomorrow,

992
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:46,970
then she gets on that boat
and she's gone.

993
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:48,560
So, it's over?

994
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:54,780
Hey! Thanks for sticking with me
through this, guys, but...

995
01:07:55,170 --> 01:07:57,250
you should probably call your parents,

996
01:07:57,430 --> 01:08:00,320
have them wire you
some money and go home.

997
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,100
What are you gonna do?

998
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:08,110
I'm going to Rome.
I'll walk, I'll hitchhike,

999
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:11,130
I'll swim if I have to,
but I'll get to Mieke somehow.

1000
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,450
Maybe that'll help.

1001
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:18,920
Where'd you get all that?

1002
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:21,890
Wait. Where's your Leica?

1003
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:23,730
Sold it.

1004
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:25,460
What?

1005
01:08:27,010 --> 01:08:29,820
You sold your Leica?
But you loved that thing.

1006
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:32,490
What about your photo tour of Europe?
What about the chateaus?

1007
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:35,150
Chateaus have been there
for 300 years.

1008
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,070
Mieke's gone in 12 hours.

1009
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:42,450
Come on let's go! Frommer's says you're supposed to

1010
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,650
check in three
hours before international flights.

1011
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,620
Come here, guidebook!

1012
01:08:46,670 --> 01:08:49,620
Whoo! We're going to Rome.
We're going to Rome!

1013
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:01,800
? " Be my girl " ?

1014
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:05,020
? " Be my girl " ?

1015
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:06,990
? " Are you gonna be my " ?

1016
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:09,520
? " Girl, yeah " ?

1017
01:09:09,610 --> 01:09:11,470
? " Be my girl " ?

1018
01:09:11,530 --> 01:09:14,060
? " Be my girl " ?

1019
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:17,200
? " Are you gonna be my girl " ?

1020
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:23,850
All right, summer at sea group.

1021
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:26,020
Our tour begins in the Vatican museum.

1022
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:28,070
This way, please.

1023
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:38,000
There it is.

1024
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:46,930
This entrance is
for private tour groups only.

1025
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:51,500
Oh... but we are
a private tour group.

1026
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,600
We've come all the way from America.

1027
01:09:56,270 --> 01:09:59,320
That guy in the orange jacket
is mentally retarded.

1028
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:08,830
Si, I can tell.
How very, very sad.

1029
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:10,900
Yes, it is.

1030
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:13,270
But if you are a tour,
where is your guide?

1031
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,620
We've got a fantastic tour guide.

1032
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:18,290
- Right here.
- What? No...

1033
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:24,800
The Vatican has been used
as a papal residence

1034
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,720
ever since the time
of Constantine the Great

1035
01:10:26,730 --> 01:10:28,430
the Great in the 5th century A.D.!

1036
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:32,310
Let them in

1037
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:36,230
OK... um... if you'll
all follow me, please.

1038
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:42,900
Have a very special day

1039
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:47,070
for a very special little man.

1040
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:48,770
OK.

1041
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:53,290
I can't believe that guy let us in.

1042
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:55,110
What a retard!

1043
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:56,800
- Okay. Let's find Mieke.
- Scusate.

1044
01:10:58,450 --> 01:11:01,480
One of our English-speaking
tour guides has called in sick.

1045
01:11:01,650 --> 01:11:04,640
Could you please take
these peoples also?

1046
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:10,460
- How big is Vatican City?
- 0.5 square kilometers.

1047
01:11:10,510 --> 01:11:14,960
- Who built the colonnades?
- Gianlorenzo Bernini, 1656.

1048
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:17,630
- Where are the bathrooms?
- Floors 2,6 and 7.

1049
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:21,120
Next I'll take you to where the
College of Cardinals elects a new pope.

1050
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:24,160
When this happens, white smoke
is sent up from the Vatican.

1051
01:11:24,170 --> 01:11:26,980
- Here's a fun fact...
- Mieke must be around here somewhere.

1052
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:28,530
Ði nào.

1053
01:11:37,490 --> 01:11:40,580
Behind me is the appartamento papale,

1054
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:43,760
or "papal apartment."
We're obviously not permitted.

1055
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,680
Excuse me, miss. What is this?

1056
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,380
That is the bell of San Marco.

1057
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:52,230
When the pope dies,
the Cardinal Vicar of Rome

1058
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:54,440
rings this bell to notify
the people of Rome.

1059
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:58,220
Next we will view the Sistine Chapel.
Follow me, please.

1060
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:03,980
Come on. I think I hear them.

1061
01:12:04,130 --> 01:12:05,030
Which way did they go?

1062
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,650
That way. I'd stake
my reputation on it.

1063
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:09,240
Good enough for me.

1064
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:13,090
Hey, check it out!
I wonder what this does.

1065
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:16,860
It doesn't do anything,
it's a rope. Come on, let's go.

1066
01:12:16,910 --> 01:12:19,000
They got a lot
of old stuff here.

1067
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:27,870
Dio mio!

1068
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,870
The bell of San Marco!

1069
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:34,510
The pope is dead!

1070
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:39,680
Whoa.

1071
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:44,400
She's not in here.

1072
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:46,940
Ði thôi. Chúng ta không th? ? dây lâu.

1073
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:49,240
Hey, check this out!

1074
01:12:49,330 --> 01:12:51,740
- I'm the pope!
- Cooper...

1075
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:54,400
take off the pope hat.

1076
01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:58,700
- Oh, no. It's OK.I'm catholic.
- Take it off, goddamnit!

1077
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:01,780
Oh, you took
the Lord's name in vain!

1078
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:04,190
Only I can forgive
you now, my son.

1079
01:13:04,470 --> 01:13:05,710
Take that fudging thing off!

1080
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:08,010
The pope breaks an open-field tackle.

1081
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:10,630
It's a Hail Mary,
he catches at the 40...

1082
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:13,300
th? 30, th? 20, th? 10...

1083
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:15,350
S? th? di!

1084
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:19,310
The pope makes a two-point conversion.

1085
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:22,160
oh, my Lord!
It's the Pope, eight,

1086
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:23,610
and the heathens, nothing!

1087
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:25,900
nothing!

1088
01:13:25,950 --> 01:13:28,600
How's you, sucka?

1089
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:32,870
Cooper, the hat! The hat!

1090
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:34,320
The hat is on fire!

1091
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:36,460
" We don't need no water
let the m... "

1092
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,420
I'm not kidding! Look!

1093
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,410
Oh, holy shit!

1094
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:42,710
I don't want this!

1095
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:45,080
Fireplace! Fireplace!
Go, go!

1096
01:13:46,670 --> 01:13:48,630
Whoa!

1097
01:13:55,630 --> 01:13:57,960
White smoke!

1098
01:13:58,010 --> 01:14:01,300
They've elected the new pope!

1099
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:06,290
I'm coming to you live
from Vatican Square

1100
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:08,890
where the College of Cardinals,
in a surprise move,

1101
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:13,780
has just elected a new pope.
The crowd is very excited.

1102
01:14:13,830 --> 01:14:15,320
This is so strange.

1103
01:14:15,510 --> 01:14:18,980
Usually they wait 15 days
to elect a new pope.

1104
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:21,330
We could be seeing
history in the making!

1105
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:23,820
We could be seeing an arrest
in the making.

1106
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:34,180
There she is. Mieke!

1107
01:14:36,770 --> 01:14:38,550
Hey! Stupid curtain!

1108
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:41,600
Let me out!

1109
01:14:44,670 --> 01:14:46,690
Mieke!

1110
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:48,840
It's the new pope!

1111
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:18,010
What the hell...?

1112
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:24,260
Mieke!

1113
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:28,570
Hold on!

1114
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:36,780
This is one crazy pope.

1115
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:47,240
You!

1116
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:50,420
Ferma! Stop! You!

1117
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:55,900
You... and your retarded friend,

1118
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:58,050
you're in big, big trouble.

1119
01:15:58,100 --> 01:15:59,300
Oy!

1120
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:04,750
Take your mitts off them boys!

1121
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,970
They're with me!

1122
01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:12,030
I've just about had enough
of you fuckin' ities!

1123
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,480
But I am Swiss!

1124
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:17,320
Them, too!

1125
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:24,370
Now, bud...

1126
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:27,380
you get in there, and you
say what you got to say.

1127
01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:31,050
Mieke. I'm here.

1128
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:32,550
I made it.

1129
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:37,620
Who are you?

1130
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:45,140
What a fucking loser!
I'm gonna videotape this.

1131
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:48,730
I'm Scott.

1132
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,180
From Ohio?

1133
01:16:50,270 --> 01:16:53,970
Scott? Scott Thomas?

1134
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:57,690
- Yes.
- From Ohio?

1135
01:16:57,770 --> 01:17:00,830
- What are you doing in Rome?
- I came here to be with you.

1136
01:17:00,910 --> 01:17:03,610
Listen, I just traveled
all the way across Europe.

1137
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:06,080
I got chased by naked men.

1138
01:17:06,150 --> 01:17:09,650
I ate brownies with absolutely
no drugs in them.

1139
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:13,820
I watched a brother
and sister make out.

1140
01:17:13,870 --> 01:17:17,960
I kicked a robot in the balls,
but I did it all so that...

1141
01:17:18,010 --> 01:17:20,180
so I could tell you one thing.

1142
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,880
I love you, Mieke.

1143
01:17:24,970 --> 01:17:27,440
Aww...

1144
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:30,170
We're perfect for each other.
What do you think?

1145
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:33,230
I think...

1146
01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:51,790
Oh, Mike... Mieke!

1147
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:07,140
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

1148
01:18:07,210 --> 01:18:08,810
I have cheated on my husband.

1149
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:11,650
Do you think God will ever forgive me?

1150
01:18:11,710 --> 01:18:13,480
Oh, yes!

1151
01:18:15,150 --> 01:18:16,220
- Father?

1152
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:20,860
- Father?

1153
01:18:26,330 --> 01:18:28,110
This sucks.

1154
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:31,900
I can't believe I'm the only one
who didn't hook up while we were here.

1155
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:34,840
Europe is officially
the worst country on Earth.

1156
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:36,370
I know.

1157
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:40,040
I thought I'd at least get to
have some crazy European sex.

1158
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:44,960
What?

1159
01:18:53,890 --> 01:18:56,060
- Scott, I have to go.
- OK.

1160
01:18:56,860 --> 01:18:59,530
My boat is leaving.

1161
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,030
I still can't believe
you came all the way here,

1162
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:03,620
just for me.

1163
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:07,040
What can I say?
I'm very unpredictable.

1164
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:09,790
Keep writing to me, Scott, OK?

1165
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:11,410
Yeah, I will.

1166
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:32,730
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1167
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:35,430
Whoo-hoo!

1168
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:39,070
Hey, guys, I'm so glad we got
to take this trip together.

1169
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:41,520
This was the best time of my life.

1170
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,080
Excuse me.

1171
01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:50,610
You're the young man who gave me
that tour of the Vatican, aren't you?

1172
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:56,030
- Listen, I'm very sorry...
- I just wanted to thank you.

1173
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:59,840
You were the most knowledgeable,
albeit idiosyncratic,

1174
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,490
tour guide I've ever had.

1175
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:03,260
Thanks.

1176
01:20:03,530 --> 01:20:05,510
But I'm not actually a tour guide.

1177
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,460
I've just read Frommer's
enough to have it memorized.

1178
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:11,350
Although I threw in a few things
Frommer's didn't know about.

1179
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:13,190
How would you like to add them?

1180
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:14,690
Excuse me?

1181
01:20:14,770 --> 01:20:17,810
That's my guidebook.

1182
01:20:23,030 --> 01:20:24,780
I'm Arthur Frommer.

1183
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:28,550
Ng?c nhiên chua!

1184
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:32,850
Frommer's is going to pay me to see
every museum and cathedral in Europe.
tu?ng dài ? châu Âu.

1185
01:20:33,110 --> 01:20:36,070
- That sounds so exciting...

1186
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:38,990
for you.

1187
01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:41,300
I figured, since you're
going to be staying,

1188
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,750
you might need this.

1189
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:46,640
- A disposable camera.
- That's right.

1190
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:47,890
Thanks, Scotty.

1191
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:49,540
That's from both of us.

1192
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:53,260
Scotty doesn't know

1193
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:59,380
Hello, Mr. Walters.

1194
01:20:59,430 --> 01:21:01,070
I see.

1195
01:21:01,150 --> 01:21:03,820
Fired? Well, I...

1196
01:21:03,890 --> 01:21:07,820
Well, if that's what you want,
I understand. I just...

1197
01:21:07,890 --> 01:21:10,660
goodbye, sir.

1198
01:21:10,730 --> 01:21:12,680
They had to catch you
eventually, right?

1199
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:14,580
- No, they fired Humphrey.
- Shut up!

1200
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:16,030
I got his office and a raise.

1201
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,670
- No!

1202
01:21:17,730 --> 01:21:21,340
Flight 341
from Rome to Cleveland...

1203
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:22,590
That's you guys.

1204
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:25,120
- Have a good flight, everybody.
- Come here.

1205
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:29,410
Be good.

1206
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,910
- Oh! OK...

1207
01:21:33,170 --> 01:21:35,750
- Cooper, have a good flight.
- Be good.

1208
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:36,890
Thanks.

1209
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:11,890
I'm on it.

1210
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:23,630
This still
counts as Europe, right?

1211
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:34,240
"Dear Mieke,

1212
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:37,080
"Greece sounds incredible.

1213
01:22:37,150 --> 01:22:39,350
"I just moved into my dorm room today,

1214
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,970
"but I can't wait to see you
over Christmas break.

1215
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:45,020
"This time I think
I'll fly to Berlin direct."

1216
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:54,010
- Hello?
- Hey, buddy, how's college?

1217
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:57,220
I just got here. My roommate
hasn't even showed up yet.

1218
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:59,470
Do they room all you
pre-med geeks together?

1219
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,400
I'm not sure I'm going pre-med.

1220
01:23:01,470 --> 01:23:03,220
I'm thinking about majoring in German.

1221
01:23:03,310 --> 01:23:05,560
German? I've got a better idea.

1222
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:07,840
Why don't you major
in not being such a woman?

1223
01:23:07,890 --> 01:23:09,310
So, how's Jenny?

1224
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,680
Jenny... Jenny who?

1225
01:23:11,850 --> 01:23:14,180
I know a lot of ladies
named Jenny, they're all...

1226
01:23:14,230 --> 01:23:15,570
Ow!

1227
01:23:17,190 --> 01:23:18,820
Hey, Scotty, what's up?

1228
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:20,190
Hi, Jenny!

1229
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:22,680
Have you heard from Jamie?
How's he doing with Frommer?

1230
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:23,630
Oh, no.

1231
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:29,750
Hold on.

1232
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:31,720
Come here, robot!

1233
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,870
Cooper, not again!

1234
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,810
Hold on, this could be
my new roommate.

1235
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:45,550
What's the freak look like?

1236
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:49,050
Is he a dork or is he cool?
Better not be cooler than me.

1237
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:51,150
Is he bigger than me?

1238
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:54,060
I just got your last email.
What are you doing here?

1239
01:23:54,110 --> 01:23:56,270
Going to college.

1240
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:58,780
You're going to college here?

1241
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:02,280
- What dorm?
- This one.

1242
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:04,580
Room 214.

1243
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:09,620
How is this possible?

1244
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:13,010
I guess they thought I was a guy.

1245
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:16,960
Now who would be dumb enough
to make a mistake like that?

1246
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,720
Do I hear kissing?

1247
01:24:27,770 --> 01:24:30,930
Are you making out with
your new roommate, Scotty?

1248
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:35,400
Scotty?

1249
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:38,200
Scotty? Scotty!

1250
01:24:38,270 --> 01:24:41,500
" Scotty doesn't know
that Fiona and me "

1251
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,210
This happy ending is bullshit.

1252
01:24:43,770 --> 01:24:46,740
When does the fairy get laid?
I'm outta here.

1253
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:50,060
" Still she's on her knees
And Scotty doesn't know "

1254
01:24:50,130 --> 01:24:53,780
" Oh, Scotty doesn't know "

1255
01:24:53,830 --> 01:24:56,390
- Catchy tune.
- Fuckin'-a, man.

1256
01:25:00,670 --> 01:25:04,060
" Fiona says she's out shopping "

1257
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:10,300
" But she's under me
And I'm not stopping "

1258
01:25:10,350 --> 01:25:14,440
Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!

1259
01:25:14,490 --> 01:25:15,960
Scotty doesn't know!

1260
01:25:15,970 --> 01:25:17,420
Hello

1261
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:21,780
and welcome to Amsterdam's finest and most
luxurious youth hostel.

1262
01:25:21,810 --> 01:25:23,160
Sounds great.

1263
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:25,780
There is no bathroom,
nor is there one nearby.

1264
01:25:25,850 --> 01:25:29,330
" I can't believe
He's so trusting "

1265
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:36,160
" While I'm right behind you thrusting "

1266
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:38,130
- Get it?
- She got it.

1267
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:41,630
If you do not wish to have
your valuables stolen,

1268
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:45,580
I suggest destroying them
or discarding them right now.

1269
01:25:45,670 --> 01:25:49,150
You can also try hiding
your valuables...

1270
01:25:49,290 --> 01:25:50,690
in your anus.

1271
01:25:51,570 --> 01:25:52,340
Drink?

1272
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:00,570
I'm gonna rip away his pants
and look at his dick, OK?

1273
01:26:00,650 --> 01:26:02,700
- Ready? Quit. Shut up.

1274
01:26:02,790 --> 01:26:05,350
Sorry. I know I fucked it up.

1275
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:07,660
Yes! You take her hair...

1276
01:26:07,710 --> 01:26:11,210
and one strand at a time,
pull it out!

1277
01:26:11,290 --> 01:26:13,960
Use her like a humping post!

1278
01:26:14,030 --> 01:26:16,260
Jenny, this is Europe.

1279
01:26:16,330 --> 01:26:18,500
They have orange juice ads
with lesbians and dildos.

1280
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:23,420
"Happy juice."

1281
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:25,390
You gotta show them something they haven't seen.

1282
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:29,590
? " Fiona's got him on the phone " ?

1283
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:32,760
? " And she's trying not to moan " ?

1284
01:26:32,850 --> 01:26:36,570
? " It's a three Way call
And he knows nothing " ?

1285
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:38,570
? " Nothing, Scotty doesn't know " ?

1286
01:26:38,650 --> 01:26:41,600
? " Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know " ?

1287
