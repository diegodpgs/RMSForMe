1
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,388
Ladies and gentlemen, we are about
to descend into Los Angeles.

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,037
The sound you just heard
was the landing gear.

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,790
The weather in Los Angeles is clear,
temperature 7 2 degrees.

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,279
We expect to make our flight today
in four hours and eighteen minutes.

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,350
We enjoyed having you on board
and hope to see you again soon.

6
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,077
[Skipped item nr. 6]

7
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,957
What's wrong?

8
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,993
The guests are all downstairs.
They're waiting to see you, Ben.

9
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,839
Dad, can you tell them
that I need to be alone for a while?

10
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,111
These are our good friends.

11
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,917
Most of them have known you
practically since you were born.

12
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,873
What is it, Ben?

13
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,473
I'm just . . .

14
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,155
Worried?

15
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,915
Well . . .

16
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,473
About what?

17
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,956
I guess about my future.

18
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,192
What about it?

19
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,392
I don't know.

20
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,394
I want it to be . . .

21
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,875
To be what?

22
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,752
Different.

23
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,998
Is anything wrong?
- No, we were just coming down.

24
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,910
The Carlsons are here!
- They are? Well, c'mon!

25
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,920
They came all the way from Tarzana!

26
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,115
C'mon, let's go! - It's wonderful
to have so many devoted friends.

27
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,110
There's the scholar!
- We're very proud of you.

28
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,120
Thanks, Mrs. Carlson.
- Is that the new car outside?

29
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,509
Ben's graduation gift. - Pickin' up
the teenyboppers won't be hard now!

30
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:22,795
I think Ben is past the teenybopper
stage, aren't you, Ben? - Yes, ma'am.

31
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,312
Excuse me,
I have to check the car for a minute.

32
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,632
Bob bought him an Alfa Romeo.

33
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,789
Here's the track star. How are you?
- Just fine, Mr. Loomis.

34
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,710
I wanna drink, then I want to hear
about that Hopperman award you won.

35
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,958
Helpingham.
- Right. Wait right here!

36
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,949
Ben, we're all so proud of you!
- Proud! Proud! Proud!

37
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,551
What are you going to do now?
- Go upstairs. - With your future?

38
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,231
Your life?
- That's a little hard to say.

39
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,240
Ben!
- Excuse me! Mr. McGuire.

40
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,513
Come with me, I want to talk to you.
Excuse us, Joanne. - Of course.

41
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,271
I just want to say one word to you.

42
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,757
Yes, sir?
- Are you listening? - Yes, I am.

43
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,997
Plastics!

44
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,588
Exactly how do you mean? - There's a
great future there. Think about it.

45
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,917
Think about it, OK?
- I will.

46
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,952
Enough said. That's a deal.

47
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,355
There he is! There's Ben!

48
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,957
Excuse me just a minute.

49
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,755
Listen everybody,
I want you all to be quiet!

50
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:03,149
I have Ben's yearbook. Let me read you
some wonderful things about him.

51
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,593
Quiet, please!
"Captain of the Cross-Country Team,

52
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,909
Head of the Debating Club, Associate
Newspaper Editor his junior year . . ."

53
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,151
I guess this isn't the bathroom.
- It's down the hall.

54
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,036
How are you, Benjamin?
- Fine, thanks, Mrs. Robinson.

55
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,040
The bathroom's at the end of the hall.

56
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,076
Such a pleasant room.
- Look, Mrs. Robinson,

57
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,594
I don't mean to be rude, but I'm . . .
- Is there an ashtray in here?

58
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,875
No. - I forgot.
The track star doesn't smoke.

59
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,198
Is it a girl?

60
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,036
Is what a girl?

61
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,198
Whatever is upsetting you.

62
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:38,431
No, I'm just disturbed about things.
- In general? - That's right.

63
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,429
Well . . .

64
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,716
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

65
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,677
I want to ask you something.
Will you take me home?

66
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,157
My husband took the car.
Will you drive me home?

67
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:04,068
Here . . . you take it.
You know how to work a foreign shift?

68
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,114
You don't?
- No.

69
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,473
Let's go.

70
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,437
Thank you.
- Right.

71
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,280
Will you come in, please?
- What?

72
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,078
Until I get the lights on. - Why?
- I don't feel safe until they're on.

73
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,750
Please go ahead of me to the porch.
I feel funny about a dark house.

74
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,158
But it's light in there.
- Please.

75
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,751
What do you drink? Bourbon?

76
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,760
Look, Mrs. Robinson, I drove you home.

77
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,228
I was glad to do it. But I have some
things on my mind. Do you understand?

78
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,351
What do you drink?

79
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,359
I don't want to be left alone
in the house. - Why not?

80
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,438
Wait till my husband comes.

81
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,113
When is he coming back?
- I don't know.

82
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,556
Drink?
- No.

83
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,155
Are you always this much afraid
of being alone? - Yes.

84
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,353
Can't you just lock the doors?

85
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,030
I'm very neurotic.

86
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,112
May I ask you a question?
What do you think of me?

87
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,592
What do you mean? - You've known me
all your life. You have some opinion.

88
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,197
I always thought
you were a very nice person.

89
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,151
Did you know I was an alcoholic?

90
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,155
What?

91
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,794
Did you know?

92
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,671
I think I should be going.

93
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,268
Sit down. - Mrs. Robinson,
this conversation has become strange.

94
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,999
Mr. Robinson will be here any minute.
- No, my husband will be home late.

95
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,749
He should be gone for several hours.

96
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,474
Oh, my God!

97
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,275
Pardon?
- Oh, no, Mrs. Robinson! No!

98
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,474
What's wrong?
- You didn't expect . . .?

99
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,955
What?

100
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,837
You didn't think I'd do something like
that? - What? - What do you think?

101
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,751
I don't know. - For God's sake,
Mrs. Robinson, here we are.

102
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,512
You got me in your house.
You give me a drink, put music on,

103
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,913
open up your private life and tell me
your husband's coming late. - So?

104
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,993
Mrs. Robinson,
you're trying to seduce me!

105
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,675
Aren't you?

106
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,910
I hadn't thought of it.
I feel very flattered.

107
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,476
Mrs. Robinson, please forgive me.

108
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,198
It's all right. - It's not all right.
It's horrible. - Sit down.

109
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,397
Please forgive me, I'm just mixed up.
- It's all right. Finish your drink.

110
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:30,994
It makes me sick that I said that.
- Forget it now.

111
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,919
What is wrong with me?
- Have you seen Elaine's portrait?

112
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,233
Her portrait?
- Yes. - No.

113
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,434
We did it last Christmas.
Want to see it? - Very much.

114
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,433
It's here, in Elaine's room.

115
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,312
Elaine really is an attractive girl.

116
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:08,318
I don't remember her as having
brown eyes. - Come over here.

117
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,749
Over there?

118
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,155
Sure.

119
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:21,038
Will you unzip my dress?
I'll go to bed. - Well, good night!

120
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,119
Won't you unzip my dress?
- I'd rather not.

121
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,836
You still think I'm seducing you?
- No, I don't, I just feel funny.

122
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:33,035
You've known me for so long.
Come on, it's hard for me to reach.

123
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,115
Thank you.

124
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,116
What are you scared of? - I'm not
scared. - Why do you keep walking out?

125
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,472
Because you're going to bed.
I shouldn't be up here.

126
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,152
Haven't you ever seen anybody
in a slip before? - Yes, but . . .

127
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,230
What if Mr. Robinson came back?
- What if? - It would look strange.

128
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,229
Don't you think he trusts us?
- But he might get the wrong idea!

129
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,276
How could anyone think you and I . . .
- But they would! Don't you see?

130
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,952
I am not trying to seduce you!
- I know, but please, Mrs. Robinson!

131
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,834
Would you like me to seduce you?
- What?

132
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,477
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
- I'm going now.

133
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,232
I hope you can forget what I said.
But I'm going home right now.

134
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,319
Can you bring up my purse?
- I must go.

135
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,991
I don't want to put this back on.
- Where is it?

136
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,556
On the table in the hall.

137
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,077
I'm in the bathroom. - Here's
the purse. - Could you bring it up?

138
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,034
I'll hand it to you.
Come to the railing.

139
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:57,237
I'm tired of this suspicion! If you
won't do this simple favor, well . . .

140
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:04,710
I'm putting it on the top step.
- For God's sake, bring me the purse!

141
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,397
I'm putting it by the door. - Will
you bring it to me? - I'd rather not.

142
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,197
All right, put it in Elaine's room,
where we were. - Right.

143
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,475
Oh, God!

144
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,314
Let me out!
- Don't be nervous.

145
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:37,392
Get away from that door. - First, I
want you to know that you can have me.

146
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,756
If you won't sleep with me now,
you can call me up any other time.

147
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,716
Understand?
- Let me out!

148
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,676
Did you understand? I find you
very attractive, and any time you . . .

149
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,314
That's him!

150
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,437
Is that Ben's car in front?
- Yes, sir!

151
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,671
I drove Mrs. Robinson home.
She asked me to, so I drove her home.

152
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,517
I appreciate it.

153
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,639
She's upstairs. She wanted me
to wait down here until you got home.

154
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,595
Standing guard over the old castle?
- Yes, sir.

155
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,914
Congratulations!
- Thank you.

156
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,991
Looks like you need a refill.
- Oh, no, I have to go.

157
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,228
Is anything wrong?
You look a little shaken up.

158
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,629
No. I'm just a little worried
about my future. Just a little upset.

159
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:49,149
Let's have a nightcap together.
Scotch? - Bourbon.

160
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,350
How old are you now?

161
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,519
20, I'll be 21 next week.

162
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,313
That's a helluva good age to be.
- Thanks.

163
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,869
Thank you, sir.

164
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,188
I wish I was that age again.
Because, Ben . . . - Sir?

165
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,519
You'll never be young again.
- I know.

166
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,432
Can I say something to you?
- What?

167
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,959
How long have we known each other?

168
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,314
How long have you and I
known each other?

169
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:07,233
How long have your Dad and I
been partners? - Quite a while.

170
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,311
I watched you grow up, Ben.
- Yes, sir.

171
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,273
In many ways I feel as though
you were my own son. - Thank you.

172
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,556
So I hope you won't mind
a friendly piece of advice.

173
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,110
I'd like to hear it.

174
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,352
I think

175
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,512
you ought to be taking it a little
easier right now than you seem to be.

176
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,512
Sow a few wild oats.
Take things as they come.

177
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,795
Have a good time with the girls.
- Don't get up.

178
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,434
I was just telling . . .
- Ben. - . . . Ben

179
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,193
to sow a few wild oats. Have a good
time. You think that's sound advice?

180
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,996
Yes, I do.
- I've got to go.

181
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,075
You have yourself
a few flings this summer.

182
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,196
I'll bet you're quite a ladies' man?
- Oh, no.

183
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,192
What? You look like the kind of guy
who has to fight them off.

184
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,236
Doesn't he look to you like he has
to fight them off? - Yes, he does.

185
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:42,674
Oh, say, Elaine gets down
from Berkeley on Saturday. - Oh, yes.

186
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,351
Why don't you give her a call?
- I will.

187
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,316
Thanks for taking me home.
I'll see you soon, I hope.

188
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,388
Your attention, please. For this
afternoon's feature attraction

189
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,912
Hey, over there, yes, I mean you!

190
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,032
Your attention please.

191
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,908
Are you ready, feature attraction?
- Can I speak to you for a second?

192
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:19,150
Listen, I need some applause
to bring this boy out here, OK? No!

193
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,388
Let me amend that.
To bring this young man out here,

194
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,798
because today he is 21 .

195
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,479
Let's go!

196
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:34,118
Hold on, I've got a few words to say.
- You always do!

197
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,278
Look who's talking!

198
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,271
Dad, can we talk for a second?
- I can't hold them much longer.

199
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,792
I'd like to discuss this.
- This boy, I'm sorry . . .

200
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,791
this young man, will continue learning
as a Helpingham Award scholar.

201
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,555
but before he does, before he does . . .

202
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,755
You're disappointing them, Ben.
You really are! - Dad, listen . . .

203
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,918
I'll give you ten seconds!

204
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,990
He is going to give us a demonstration
of what I feel safe in saying is a

205
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,069
pretty exciting birthday present.
It'd better work, or I'm out

206
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,992
over two hundred bucks.
Okay, let's hear it now for Benjamin

207
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,953
Braddock!

208
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,954
Come on, Benjie!

209
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,868
Let's hear it. Thatta boy!

210
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,992
Now folks, this remarkable young man

211
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,955
will perform some spectacular
and amazing feats of daring

212
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,039
in water that is over 6 feet deep.

213
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,953
Hello?

214
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,509
I don't know how to put this . . .
- Benjamin?

215
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,670
I was thinking about that time
after the party . . . - Where are you?

216
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,352
I was wondering if I could
buy you a drink. - Where are you?

217
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,834
The Taft Hotel.
- Did you get a room? - No.

218
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,190
I know it's pretty late, and . . .
- Give me an hour. - What?

219
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,795
I'll be there in an hour.

220
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,715
Can I help you, sir?

221
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,873
What? No, I'm just . . .

222
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,992
Are you here for an affair, sir?

223
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,709
What?

224
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,354
The Singleman party?

225
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:40,360
Yes, the Singleman party.
- It's in the Main Ballroom. - Thanks.

226
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,388
You must be one of the Porters?
- No, I . . .

227
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,311
This is my sister, Miss DeWitte.
- How do you do? - How do you do?

228
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:11,197
That's my husband, Mr. Singleman.
And Jeffrey, of course.

229
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,996
I didn't get your name, sir.
- Benjamin Braddock, sir.

230
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,434
Yes, but I'm afraid . . .
- I'll find your table!

231
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,997
Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.

232
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,950
I'm looking for a friend.
- I don't understand.

233
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,995
I'm not with your party, I'm sorry.
- I don't get it.

234
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,034
I've enjoyed meeting you, Mr. Braniff.

235
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,398
Hello, Benjamin.
- Oh, hello.

236
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,836
May I sit down?
- Of course. - Thank you.

237
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,750
How are you?
- Very well, thank you.

238
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,960
May I have a drink?
- A drink? Of course.

239
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,835
He didn't see me.
- Waiter!

240
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,555
I will have a Martini.
- Yes, madam.

241
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,158
You don't have to be so nervous.
- Nervous?

242
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,038
I am a bit nervous.
It's hard to be suave when you're . . .

243
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,712
Did you get us a room? - What?
- Did you get a room yet? - No.

244
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:09,553
Do you want to? - Well, I don't . . .
I could . . . Or we could just talk.

245
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,759
Do you want me to get it?
- No, I'll get it.

246
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,471
Now?
- Now? - Yes.

247
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,073
I don't know.

248
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,355
Why don't you get it?
- Well, I will then, excuse me.

249
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,595
Excuse me.

250
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,839
Yes, sir?

251
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,235
A room. I'd like a room, please.
- Single or double?

252
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:55,196
A single. Just for myself.
- Sign the register, please.

253
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,993
Is anything wrong, sir?
- What? No, nothing.

254
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,109
Do you have luggage, Mr. Gladstone?
- Luggage?

255
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,710
Yes, I do.
- Where is it?

256
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,913
What?
- Where is your luggage?

257
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,990
It's out in the car.
- I'll have a porter get it.- Oh no!

258
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:32,511
I don't want to cause any trouble.
I just have a toothbrush.

259
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,748
I can get it myself. - Of course.
I'll have a porter show you the room.

260
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,749
Oh, actually,
I'd just as soon find it myself.

261
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,637
I just have a toothbrush to carry
and I think I can handle it myself.

262
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,514
Whatever you say, sir.
- Thank you.

263
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,389
Mrs. Robinson?

264
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,876
For you.
- Thank you.

265
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,471
Hello?
- Mrs. Robinson?

266
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,036
It's Benjamin.
- Yes?

267
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,836
Benjamin Braddock.
- Where are you?

268
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,595
Can you look through the glass?

269
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,038
Can you see me now?
- Yes, I can.

270
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,153
I got a single room.
- That's fine.

271
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,559
But there's one thing. The desk clerk
seemed a little suspicious.

272
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,073
I don't know their policy . . .
- Do you want to go up first? - Yes.

273
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,798
I'll be up in five minutes.
- Goodbye then. - Benjamin!

274
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,879
Isn't there something
you want to tell me?

275
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:45,157
I want you to know how much
I appreciate this. - The number.

276
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,034
You ought to tell me the number.

277
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,948
You're absolutely right.

278
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,550
It's 568.

279
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,035
Thank you.

280
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,993
You're welcome.

281
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,830
Well,

282
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,354
I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.

283
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,839
Check, please.

284
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,789
I've got it.

285
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,199
I say I've got it.
The toothbrush! - Very good, sir.

286
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,518
Well, good night.
- Good night, sir.

287
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,833
Hello, Benjamin.

288
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,039
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.

289
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,348
Well . . .

290
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,028
Well . . .

291
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,554
Benjamin . . .

292
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,715
Yes?

293
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,675
I'll get undressed now, alright?
- Sure, shall I . . .?

294
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,874
Shall I just stand here?
I don't know what you want me to do?

295
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,996
Why don't you watch? - OK, thank you.
- Will you bring me a hanger? - What?

296
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,753
A hanger.
- Oh, yes.

297
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,155
Wood?

298
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,353
What?
- Wood or wire? They have both.

299
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,075
Either one.
- Okay.

300
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,635
Thank you.

301
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,588
Would you help me, please?
- Certainly.

302
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,358
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

303
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:08,709
Would this be easier in the dark?
- I can't do this.

304
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,230
You what?
- This all is wrong.

305
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,830
Do you find me undesirable?
- No!

306
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,831
You are the most attractive of all my
parent's friends. You're desirable

307
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,796
But for God's sake, what would my
parents say if they were here now?

308
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,473
What? - I have no idea.
But they made a good life for me.

309
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,152
They deserve a little better than
going to bed with the partner's wife.

310
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,513
Are you afraid of me?
- No, you're missing the point.

311
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,511
Maybe we could do something else.
Would you like to go to a movie?

312
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,075
Can I ask you a personal question?
- Anything. - Is this your first time?

313
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,159
Is this what?
- It is, isn't it? Your first time?

314
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,798
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson.
- You can admit that, can't you?

315
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,516
Are you kidding?
- It's nothing to be ashamed of.

316
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,350
Who said it was my first time?
- You're afraid of being inadequate.

317
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,358
Inadequate?

318
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,310
I guess I'd better . . .
- Don't move!

319
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,949
Ben, what are you doing?

320
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:09,956
I would say I am just drifting
here in the pool. - Why?

321
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,313
It's very comfortable
just to drift here.

322
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,273
Have you thought about
Graduate school? - No.

323
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,919
How about telling me what those
four years of college were for?

324
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,474
You got me.
- Now listen, Ben . . .

325
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,675
Look,

326
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:36,555
I think it's good for a young man,
after he's done some very good work,

327
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,677
to enjoy himself,
lie around and drink beer.

328
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,790
But after a few weeks

329
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,119
I believe that person would want
to take some stock in himself

330
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,438
and think about getting off his ass.

331
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,711
The Robinsons are here.

332
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,399
Hi, Ben,
what are you doing these days?

333
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:05,435
Oh, not too much. Taking it easy.

334
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:10,432
That's what I would do if I could.
There's nothing wrong with that.

335
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,510
Elaine's coming from Berkeley.
I want you to call her. - I will.

336
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,117
I think
you two would really hit it off.

337
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,149
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson.

338
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,837
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.

339
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,958
Hello, Benjamin.

340
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,635
Oh, my!

341
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,473
Can I talk to you for a minute.
- Sure.

342
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,356
Benjie, darling,
I'm going to ask you something,

343
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,112
but you don't have to tell me
if you don't want to. - What?

344
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,638
I'm going to ask you what you do

345
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,957
when you go off at night.

346
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,993
When I go off?

347
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:11,148
You don't have to tell me. - No,
I want to tell you. I drive around.

348
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,518
What else?
- Nothing else.

349
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,714
You don't drive from midnight
to noon the next day. - No.

350
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,152
Then what do you do?
Do you meet someone?

351
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,230
Why do you ask?
- Well, it's your business.

352
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,989
I don't want to play games.
- Wait!

353
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:35,158
I don't meet anyone, but why?
- I don't want to pry into your life,

354
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:40,799
but I would rather you didn't say
anything then be dishonest. - Wait!

355
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,389
Wait a minute!

356
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,836
Wait a minute, please.

357
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:52,793
Mrs. Robinson, do you think we could
talk a little first this time?

358
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,558
I don't think
we have much to say to each other.

359
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,316
For months, all we've done is
come up here and leap into bed.

360
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,440
Are you tired of it?
- I'm not, no.

361
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,510
But do you think we could liven it up
with some talk? - About what?

362
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,155
Anything at all.

363
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:21,390
Do you want to tell me about your
college experiences? - Oh, my God!

364
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,276
Think of another topic.

365
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:41,074
How about art?
- That's good. You start it off.

366
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,954
You start it off.
I know nothing about it.

367
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,473
Are you interested more
in Modern or in Classical Art?

368
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:53,391
Neither. - Neither? Why do you want
to talk about it? - I don't.

369
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:59,358
We're going to have a conversation!
Tell me what you did today.

370
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,392
I got up.

371
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:07,318
I fixed breakfast for my husband.
- That's something we can talk about.

372
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,593
Your husband!
- Oh, him.

373
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,635
I mean everything. I don't know
anything about how you work this.

374
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:19,676
What do you say when you leave?
- Nothing, he's asleep. - Always?

375
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:25,319
Doesn't he wake up when you come
home? - We have separate bedrooms.

376
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,070
Oh, I see. So you don't . . .

377
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:34,753
I don't want to pry,
but you don't sleep with him? - No.

378
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:40,194
How long has this been going on?
Why did you marry him?

379
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:45,953
See if you can guess.
- I can't. - Think real hard.

380
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:51,633
I can't see why you did, unless . . .
Were you forced to marry him?

381
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,917
Don't tell Elaine. - You had
to marry him because you got pregnant.

382
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,316
Are you shocked?

383
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:12,231
I never thought of you two as . . .
- Alright, let's get to bed.

384
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,910
Wait a minute!

385
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,235
So how did it happen?
- What?

386
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:22,719
You and Mr. Robinson. Do you feel like
telling me the circumstances?

387
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,513
Not really.

388
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,838
Was he a law student at the time?

389
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,475
And you were a student also?

390
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,469
At college?
- Yes.

391
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,070
What was your major?

392
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,195
Why are you asking all the questions?
- Because I'm interested.

393
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,234
What was your major at college?

394
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,076
Art.
- Art?

395
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,237
But I thought . . .

396
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,595
I guess you lost interest
in it over the years then.

397
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,199
Kind of.

398
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,276
How did it happen?

399
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,070
What?
- You and Mr. Robinson.

400
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:19,792
How do you think? - In his room,
or did he take you to a hotel?

401
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,710
What does it possibly matter?
- I'm curious.

402
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:28,876
We'd go to his car.
- In a car you did it?

403
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:33,677
I don't think we were the first.
- What kind of car was it?

404
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,156
What?
- Do you remember the make of the car?

405
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,878
Oh, my God!
- I want to know! - A Ford.

406
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,799
A Ford!

407
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,949
A Ford!
God damn it, that's great!

408
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:50,755
That's enough.

409
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:58,677
So old Elaine Robinson
got started in a Ford.

410
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,795
Don't talk about Elaine.
- Don't talk about Elaine?

411
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,315
No.

412
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,353
Why not?

413
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,351
Because I don't want you to.
- Why don't you tell me then?

414
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:16,828
There's nothing to tell.
- Why is she a big taboo subject?

415
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,989
I guess I'll have to ask her out
and find out what the big deal is.

416
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:25,953
Don't you ever take that girl out!
Do you understand that?

417
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,915
I have no intention of taking her out.

418
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,315
Good.

419
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,715
I was just kidding around.

420
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,755
Good.

421
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,430
But why shouldn't I?

422
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:51,717
I have my reasons. - Let's hear 'em.
- No. - I think I know the reason.

423
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:56,472
I'm not good enough for her, am I?
I can't even talk about her, can I?

424
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:02,438
Let's drop it. - No! I'm good enough
for you, but not for your daughter!

425
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,628
That's it, isn't it?

426
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:17,953
Yes.

427
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,473
You go
straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson!

428
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:27,711
Do you think I'm proud of all this?
- I wouldn't know. - I'm not.

429
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,153
I'm not proud that I spend my time
with a broken-down alcoholic.

430
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:36,878
I see. - I come here for no reason
other than sheer boredom.

431
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:41,438
This is the sickest, most perverted
thing that ever happened to me.

432
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:47,432
Do what you want, I'm done with this!
- Are you? - Goddamn right!

433
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:54,598
That's how you feel? That I'm sick
and disgusting? - Don't start this.

434
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,431
What? - Don't start acting hurt.
- Don't you expect me to be hurt?

435
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:05,113
You told me I'm not
good enough for Elaine. - Did I?

436
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,516
In so many words.

437
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,591
I want to apologize to you
if that's the impression you got.

438
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:16,989
Two minutes ago you told me I wasn't
good enough, now you say you're sorry!

439
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,479
I didn't mean it. I don't think
you'd be right for each other.

440
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,708
I would never say you weren't
as good a person as she is.

441
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,275
You wouldn't?

442
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,117
Of course I wouldn't.

443
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:39,519
What are you doing? - It's pretty
obvious you don't want me around.

444
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,869
I was kind of upset there.

445
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:52,276
I'm sorry I said those things.
- It's alright.

446
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:58,113
I can understand why
I'm disgusting to you. - I dunno.

447
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:03,153
I like you or I wouldn't keep
coming here if I didn't like you.

448
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,520
Wasn't it sickening?
- It's not . . .

449
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:14,675
I enjoy it. I look forward to it.
It's the one thing I look forward to.

450
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:21,318
You don't have to say that.
- I wouldn't, not if it wasn't true.

451
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,236
May I stay then?

452
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,588
Yes, please, I want you to.

453
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,393
Thank you. - Don't thank me.
Because I want you to.

454
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:39,673
But you won't ever take Elaine out,
will you? I want you to promise.

455
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:45,353
Why did you bring this up? It never
occurred to me. - Then give your word.

456
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,877
This is absurd.

457
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,311
Promise me, Benjamin.

458
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:55,709
Alright. For Christ's sake,
I promise I'll never take Elaine out.

459
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,789
Thank you.

460
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,671
Let's not talk about it.

461
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,876
Let's not talk at all.

462
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,550
Elaine's back from school.

463
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,515
It might be a nice gesture
if you asked her out.

464
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:07,198
I guess she's not good enough for you?
- Elaine and I do not get along.

465
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:11,997
You haven't seen her since
high school! I guess your evenings

466
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:16,274
are just too valuable.
- That has nothing to do with it.

467
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:21,840
I'll just have to tell Mr. Robinson
that you're too busy every evening.

468
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:27,229
Don't go on like this. If Ben
absolutely refuses to take her out . . .

469
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:33,710
I do. - . . . then I will just have to
invite the Robinsons over Thursday.

470
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,830
Well, Braddock, it's about time
you got around to doing this.

471
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,750
Your wife thinks you would say . . .
"Katy Duvalle . . ."

472
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,438
No points, right.

473
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:06,115
Here's the next question.
What's your wife's most unusual habit?

474
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,278
Come on in! I'm afraid

475
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,837
the young lady isn't quite ready yet.

476
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:16,791
What would you say to a short one?
Scotch still your drink? - Bourbon.

477
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:24,234
Not shaving her legs.

478
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,997
I'll see if she's ready yet.

479
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:50,070
This was my father's idea!
- I thought I was clear about this.

480
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,637
We'll go to dinner and have a drink
and I'll bring her right back.

481
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:59,598
It was that or a dinner party for both
families, and I couldn't handle that.

482
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,596
I have no intention of ever taking
her out again, so don't get upset!

483
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:10,352
But I am. I'm extremely
upset about it, Benjamin.

484
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,319
Hello.

485
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:14,556
Hello.

486
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,155
I want you to keep your wits tonight.

487
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:21,872
You never know what tricks
Ben picked up back there in the East.

488
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:35,038
You're living at home now, right?
- Yes.

489
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:39,318
Do you know what you're going to do?
- No.

490
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:46,149
Are you going to Graduate School?
- No.

491
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:54,758
Do you always drive like this?
- Yes.

492
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,439
Sit down!

493
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,518
Why don't you watch the show?

494
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:42,031
Do you dislike me for some reason?
- No, why should I?

495
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,152
I don't know.

496
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,714
You're missing a great effect here.

497
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,152
How do you like that?

498
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,916
Could you do it?

499
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,271
Elaine, I'm sorry.

500
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:46,715
Will you take me home now?
- I'm sorry I took you in there.

501
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,957
Where's the car?
- I want to tell you something.

502
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,075
I just want to go home.
- But can I just tell you one thing?

503
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:09,477
What? - This date was my parents'
idea. They forced me into it.

504
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:15,153
That's very nice of you to tell me.
- No, I mean I'm not really like this.

505
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,512
I hate myself like this.

506
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:24,231
Could you just stop crying?
- No, I couldn't.

507
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:27,797
But could you try?
- No.

508
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:46,839
Since I graduated, I feel like I have
to always be rude. Do you understand?

509
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,953
Yes, I do.

510
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:55,439
It's like I've been playing a game,
but the rules don't make any sense.

511
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:59,629
They're being made up
by all the wrong people. No,

512
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:04,471
I mean no one makes them up,
they seem to make themselves up.

513
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:10,072
I wonder if I could request you
to turn that down a little?

514
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:02,914
Would you like to come in?
I could make you some coffee. - No.

515
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:07,035
I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
- We won't.

516
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,432
Let's go inside.

517
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,314
Wait a minute.
- Is anything wrong?

518
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:17,032
I was thinking. It's still early.

519
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:21,435
Maybe we could do something,
go somewhere else.

520
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,553
Alright.

521
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:33,994
Where are we going?
- Where is a place to have a drink?

522
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:39,435
Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?
What is the matter?

523
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:44,431
Nothing! I'm just wondering
if they have a bar? Let's go see.

524
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,359
Let's go see if they do or not.

525
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:53,912
It seems to me there isn't a bar here.
- Yes, there is. Look, the Palm Room!

526
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:57,238
Good evening.
- How are you, sir?

527
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,434
Good evening, Mr. Gladstone.
- Hello again.

528
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:05,795
Hi, Mr. Gladstone.
How are you this evening?

529
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:11,796
Let's go somewhere else.
- Do they know you? - Of course not!

530
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:15,516
Good evening, sir.
- Come on, we're leaving.

531
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,113
Mr. Gladstone, how are you?

532
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:22,557
What's happening?
- They must think that I'm Gladstone.

533
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,673
Hello, Mr. Braniff.

534
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:40,519
Elaine, I like you.
I like you so much.

535
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,395
Do you believe that?

536
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,437
Do you?
- Yes.

537
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,277
You're the first . . .

538
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:56,756
You're the first thing
for so long that I've liked.

539
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,317
The first person
I could stand to be with.

540
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:05,071
My whole life is such a waste.

541
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,752
It's just nothing.

542
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:15,190
I'm sorry. I'll take you home now.

543
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,838
Are you having an affair with someone?

544
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,870
I'm sorry. That's not my business.

545
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,229
It just happened.

546
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:38,268
It was just this thing that happened
along with everything else.

547
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,998
Can you understand that?

548
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,754
Was she married or something?

549
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:46,675
Yes.

550
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:52,118
With a family?
- Yes. She had a husband and a son.

551
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:56,352
Did they ever find out?
- No.

552
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:01,914
And it's all over now?

553
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:04,955
Yes.

554
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:13,671
I'm glad.

555
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:26,709
Can we do something tomorrow?
- Alright.

556
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:31,029
During the day?
Go for a drive or something. - Okay.

557
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,789
You sure you really want to?
- Yes.

558
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:38,870
I only want to if you want to.
- I do. - You do?

559
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,550
Benjamin, I really do.

560
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:12,230
Drive!

561
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:16,709
Elaine and I have a date.
We're going for a drive.

562
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,752
Do exactly as I say!

563
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:28,718
It seems to me . . .
- Listen to me very carefully.

564
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:33,278
You are not to see Elaine again.
Those are my orders. Is that clear?

565
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:37,269
I can make things quite unpleasant.
- How?

566
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:41,918
To keep Elaine away from you,
I'm prepared to tell her everything.

567
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:45,549
I don't believe you.

568
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,192
You'd better do.

569
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,232
You wouldn't do that.

570
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:52,993
Try me.

571
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:16,555
Benjamin? - I'm coming up!
- I'm not dressed yet. Benjamin!

572
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,949
Go over the back fence. I'll meet you
around the corner. Put your shoes on.

573
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:28,998
What are you doing?
- I have to tell you something.

574
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:32,079
That woman,
that older woman I told you about.

575
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:37,310
That one? - Yes. That wasn't just
some woman. - What are you telling me?

576
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,593
Just tell me what this is all about?

577
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:55,594
Oh, no.

578
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:57,555
Oh, my God!

579
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:02,796
Get out of here.
- Don't cry. - Get out!

580
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,477
Goodbye, Benjamin.

581
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,512
Say that again.

582
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,916
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.

583
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:17,873
What's happening?

584
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,756
Ben says that
he and Elaine are getting married.

585
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:28,479
I don't believe it! - That's what he
says. - I'm going to Berkeley today.

586
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,118
This is so exciting.

587
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:37,470
Call the Robinsons. We have to
celebrate. - I think you should wait.

588
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,515
They don't know? - No.
- When did you decide this?

589
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:45,873
An hour ago. - Wait a minute.
You talked to Elaine this morning?

590
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:50,836
No. She doesn't know about it.
- That you're coming up to Berkeley?

591
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:56,075
No, that we're getting married.
- When did you two talk this over?

592
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:58,431
We haven't.
- You haven't?

593
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:02,717
This whole idea
sounds pretty half-baked.

594
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:06,914
No, it's not. It's completely baked.
It's a decision I've made.

595
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:12,514
How do you know she'll marry you?
- I don't. She doesn't even like me.

596
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:21,878
Student? - Not exactly.
- What's that? - Not exactly.

597
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:26,749
What are you then?
- I'm just sort of traveling through.

598
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:33,474
I like to know who's living here
and what my boys are up to.

599
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,196
I'm not up to much, actually.

600
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,352
I'm just visiting.

601
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,953
I've always wanted to see Berkeley.

602
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:52,318
You're not one of those
outside agitators? I hate that.

603
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:54,716
I won't stand for that.

604
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,995
What a coincidence!

605
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:39,431
I was wondering where you were
headed. - I'm meeting someone.

606
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:40,915
Where?

607
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:48,390
Where are you meeting this person?
- At the zoo. - The zoo?

608
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:50,796
They have a good one here?

609
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:56,074
I don't know. I've never seen it.
- I haven't either.

610
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:01,358
I might ride out there with you.

611
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:05,954
Is that him over there?
- No.

612
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:14,918
Where did he say he would meet you?
- I thought by the monkey house.

613
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,351
What are you doing here?

614
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:23,158
In Berkeley? I have this nice room,
and I've been getting to classes . . .

615
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:28,628
But you're not enrolled!
- No, I just sit in.

616
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:34,279
You're . . . I don't know what to say.
- Maybe we can talk about it.

617
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:36,711
Really incredible!

618
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:42,877
Here he comes. - What?
- I really think this is the fella.

619
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,676
He certainly is a good walker.

620
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:51,789
Am I late? I'm sorry.
- We thought by the monkey house.

621
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:56,279
Benjamin Braddock. Carl Smith.
Benjamin rode here with me on the bus.

622
01:16:56,720 --> 01:17:00,429
Glad to meet you, Ben.
- Great meeting you, Carl!

623
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:47,954
Who is it? - I ask you one question,
then I'm going. - Come in. - No.

624
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:53,076
Why are you here? - Because I am.
- Is it because I am here?

625
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:57,513
What do you think? - I think it is.
I said, I think it is.

626
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:01,635
Alright then, yes!
- I want you to leave. - I love you!

627
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:07,359
Do you just hate everything? How could
you possibly rape my mother? - What?

628
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:11,759
How could anyone do a thing like that?
- Tell me what she said. - Why?

629
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,873
Because it isn't true. Tell me.

630
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:19,632
She said she was having a drink, that
you waited for her in the parking lot,

631
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:24,073
that she was too drunk to drive home
and that you'd get her a room.

632
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:27,398
Then what?
- You went upstairs and raped her.

633
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:33,153
That's not true. There was this party
at my parents. I drove her home . . .

634
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:37,036
I don't want to hear it!
- We went up to see your portrait.

635
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,357
She got undressed!
- She's my mother!

636
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:42,473
Suddenly she was naked!
- Shut . . .!

637
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,991
Hello, Mr. McCleery.
- Who screamed?

638
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:04,115
It's alright.
- Screaming is not alright here.

639
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:08,348
It was just a visitor.
But it's alright now.

640
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:13,232
What'd you do to her? - She's upset
and she screamed, but it's OK now.

641
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:15,079
Shall I get the cops?

642
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:20,514
Wait a minute.
Look, here she is, having some water.

643
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,558
There's no need for the cops.

644
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:28,398
Alright boys, you can all go
back to your rooms now. Go ahead.

645
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:32,157
We won't have
any more of this agitation.

646
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:34,990
Will we, Braddock?
- No, sir.

647
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:41,715
I want you out of here.
- What do you mean? - Out of here!

648
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:45,232
What for?
- Because I don't like you.

649
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:18,600
I'm sorry I screamed.

650
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:26,476
When you came up here, what did you
think was going to happen between us?

651
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:33,712
I don't feel like talking. I'm sorry,
but I think I'll just do this now.

652
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:49,158
Can I sit here while you're packing?
- If you want.

653
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,318
What're you going to do now?

654
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:06,398
I don't know.

655
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:08,910
Are you going home?
- No.

656
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:11,436
Where are you going?

657
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:17,554
Stop asking me that.

658
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:31,391
I don't want you to leave.

659
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:35,474
I don't understand.

660
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,798
I don't want you to go anywhere

661
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:44,389
until you have a definite plan.
Goodbye.

662
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:22,074
What's happening?
- Benjamin. - What?

663
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,228
Will you kiss me?

664
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:58,316
Will you marry me?

665
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,719
You won't?
- I don't know.

666
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,717
But you might?

667
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:10,479
I might.

668
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:14,117
Is that so? You might marry me?

669
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,515
Yes.

670
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:17,355
When?

671
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,159
I don't know.

672
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:24,991
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to
be pushy, but . . . - I don't know.

673
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:28,833
I don't know what's happening.

674
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:31,631
You're confused?

675
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:37,629
Don't be confused.
We're getting married.

676
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:41,795
I don't see how we can.

677
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,476
We just can.

678
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,838
I have to go now.

679
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:01,354
Are you serious about this?

680
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:05,634
I'll think about it.
- You really will? - Yes.

681
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:19,951
Good God!

682
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:25,673
We get our blood tests tomorrow.
Or today's a good day.

683
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:28,076
I haven't said I'll marry you.

684
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:32,433
I happen to have my birth certificate
with me. Where's yours?

685
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:36,749
I just don't think it would work.
- Why wouldn't it?

686
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,758
Why wouldn't it?
- I just don't think it would.

687
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:54,715
Can we get our blood tests tomorrow?

688
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:59,916
Why don't you just drag me off
if you want to marry me so much?

689
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:05,070
Alright, I will. Right after we get
the tests. - I have to see Carl first.

690
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,398
Carl who?

691
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:11,918
Carl who?

692
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:16,911
Carl Smith! We've known him for years.
- That guy at the zoo?

693
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:21,797
Why do you have to see him?
- I said I might marry him.

694
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:23,878
You what?

695
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:28,837
How'd he do it? Did he get down
on his knees? I hope he didn't.

696
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:32,955
No.
- What did he say? I'm curious.

697
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:39,678
He said he thought we'd make a pretty
good team. - Oh no! He said that?

698
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:43,473
Where did he do it?

699
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:45,956
I'd like to know where it happened.

700
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:51,280
It wasn't in his car, was it?

701
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:04,874
Good night.

702
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:07,390
Are we getting married tomorrow?

703
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,155
No.

704
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:11,839
The day after tomorrow?

705
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:16,995
I don't know.
Maybe we are and maybe we're not.

706
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:08,675
Do you want to try
and tell me why you did it?

707
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:11,189
Mr. Robinson?

708
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:15,838
Do you have a grudge against me? Do
you feel a strong resentment? - No.

709
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:21,274
Did I say something wrong, or do you
just despise the things I stand for?

710
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:26,111
It has nothing to do with you, sir
- It was quite a bit to do with me!

711
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:32,355
We're civilized. Is it necessary to
threaten each other? - I didn't.

712
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,631
Could you unclench your fists?

713
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:38,231
Thank you. I can see in the dark.
I've been here quite a while.

714
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:43,356
I'm trying to say I have no personal
feelings here. I do not resent you.

715
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,995
You don't respect me either, do you?

716
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:49,311
No, sir.
- What? - No, sir.

717
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:54,470
Don't shout at me. I may not be as
young as you, but I still hear well.

718
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:56,990
Wait till I finish!

719
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:04,197
I think you should know that my wife
and I are getting divorced soon.

720
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:07,274
But why?
- Why?

721
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:12,669
What happened between
Mrs. Robinson and me was nothing!

722
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:17,796
It didn't mean anything. We might
as well have been shaking hands.

723
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:23,598
That's not saying much for my wife.
- You miss the point. - I guess I do.

724
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:27,589
The point is, I don't love your wife.
I love your daughter, sir.

725
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:32,511
Listen to this: I don't know
if I can prosecute, but I think I can.

726
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:36,589
I think I can get you behind bars
if you ever look at my daughter again.

727
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:39,315
I've made sure you can't get to her.

728
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:44,038
Stay away from me, Ben!
I don't want to mince words with you.

729
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:48,155
As far as Elaine is concerned, you're
to get her out of your filthy mind!

730
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:50,397
Is that clear to you?

731
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:56,199
That's all. You'll pardon me
if I don't shake hands with you!

732
01:28:57,120 --> 01:29:01,193
I think you are filth!
I think you are scum!

733
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:05,514
You are a degenerate!

734
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:18,511
Do you have some change for a
phone call? - I want you out of here!

735
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:22,589
I'll give you ten dollars for a dime.
I'll give you twenty.

736
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:27,830
Will you let me use that phone?
- I'm gonna call the police.

737
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:31,875
Could I make one phone call first?
- Get outta here!

738
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:44,994
Elaine Robinson has left school.

739
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:48,796
Her roommate
is coming down with a note for you.

740
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:56,800
Dear Benjamin, please forgive me,
for what I'm doing is best for you.

741
01:29:57,240 --> 01:30:01,836
My father is so upset. I love you
but it would never work out.

742
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:28,231
Hello, Benjamin.

743
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:35,239
Where is she?
- Get me the police, please.

744
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:40,959
One minute, Benjamin. Do you have a
patrol car near 1 200 Glenview Road?

745
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:45,598
Good. We have a burglar here.
I'll ask him. Are you armed?

746
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:49,949
I don't believe he is.

747
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:56,314
Where is she? - Everything is under
control. A quick drink before you go?

748
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:59,638
You can't stop me from seeing her.
I'll find her.

749
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:05,234
You can't come to the wedding.
It's already been planned.

750
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:08,269
What the hell have you done to her?

751
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:16,154
I don't think you'll
have time for that drink, after all.

752
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:19,519
I'll find her.
- I don't think so.

753
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:21,829
Say, fellas . . .

754
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:27,996
Anyone know where Carl Smith is? - He
took off last night, to get married.

755
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:31,113
Probably
one step ahead of the shotgun!

756
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:34,757
Where is he getting married?
I'm supposed to be there.

757
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:36,792
Ask Carter.

758
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:38,919
Where can I find him?

759
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:40,679
Hey, Carter?

760
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:45,389
Where's the Make Out King getting
married? - Santa Barbara.

761
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:50,910
Do you know exactly where in Santa
Barbara. I'm supposed to be there.

762
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:56,354
Where in Santa Barbara? - I don't
know. Maybe at his old man's home.

763
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:59,394
Or in the maternity ward!

764
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:03,913
Are you going to the wedding?
Tell him to save a piece for me . . .

765
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:07,670
. . . of the wedding cake!

766
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:53,429
Can I use your phone?
- Yeah.

767
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:22,354
657-2036. - Hello, who is this?
- Dr. Smith's answering service.

768
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:26,315
Is the doctor anywhere?
- Sorry, the doctor can't . . .

769
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:32,915
Where is he? - He's at his son's
wedding. But I'm sure it's over now.

770
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:38,434
I'm the Dr.'s brother, Reverend Smith.
I'm supposed to perform the ceremony.

771
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:42,350
I just got in from Portland
and I've forgotten what church.

772
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:48,272
I'm not sure, but maybe the First
Presbyterian, Allan Street. - Thanks.

773
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:51,150
Allan Street, where is it?

774
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:58,510
It's six blocks up and three over.

775
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:01,518
You need any gas, Father?

776
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,719
Oh, Jesus God, no!

777
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:10,915
Who is that guy? What's he doing?

778
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:13,555
I'll take care of him.
- He's too late.

779
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:25,351
We've got to stop him.

780
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:51,678
You crazy punk!

781
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:10,513
It's too late!
- Not for me!
