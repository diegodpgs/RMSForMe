1
00:01:00,843 --> 00:01:02,263
I think its our tradition...

2
00:01:02,644 --> 00:01:04,089
It comes out of a...

3
00:01:04,126 --> 00:01:06,430
...particularly painful
part of our history.

4
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:07,593
Yes. Yes.

5
00:01:07,595 --> 00:01:09,652
But it's been a way
we've been able to heal.

6
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:12,932
At first it was a
reminder of the rebellion

7
00:01:12,968 --> 00:01:15,416
It was the price the
Districts had to pay.

8
00:01:15,685 --> 00:01:17,475
But I think it has grown from that.

9
00:01:17,513 --> 00:01:19,534
I think its a...

10
00:01:19,844 --> 00:01:21,593
Its something that nets us all together.

11
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,741
This is your third year's game?

12
00:01:27,348 --> 00:01:30,043
What defines your personal signature?

13
00:01:36,518 --> 00:01:37,709
Shhhh. It's okay.

14
00:01:38,054 --> 00:01:40,457
It's okay. You're just dreaming.

15
00:01:40,493 --> 00:01:41,741
You're dreaming.

16
00:01:45,325 --> 00:01:46,739
I know.

17
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,007
I know what its like.

18
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:51,592
It's your first...
Prim, your name's gonna

19
00:01:51,593 --> 00:01:53,324
be there once, they're
not gonna pick you!

20
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:56,382
Try to go to sleep.

21
00:01:56,419 --> 00:01:57,953
I can't.

22
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,867
Just try.

23
00:02:00,274 --> 00:02:01,522
Just try.

24
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,803
Deep in the meadow.

25
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:21,360
Under the willow.

26
00:02:21,871 --> 00:02:25,220
Hop in the grass.

27
00:02:25,636 --> 00:02:29,452
A soft green and pillow.

28
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:32,792
You remember that song?

29
00:02:33,126 --> 00:02:34,373
Ok.

30
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,475
You finish it.

31
00:02:35,477 --> 00:02:36,396
I gotta go.

32
00:02:36,398 --> 00:02:37,646
Where?

33
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:39,693
I just gotta go.

34
00:02:39,732 --> 00:02:41,208
But I'll be back.

35
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:42,519
I love you.

36
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:52,360
I'll still cook you.

37
00:05:02,982 --> 00:05:05,005
What're you gonna do with
that when you kill it?

38
00:05:07,823 --> 00:05:09,142
Damn you, Gale!

39
00:05:09,515 --> 00:05:10,820
It's not funny.

40
00:05:10,857 --> 00:05:13,487
What're you gonna do with
a 100 pound deer, Katnip?

41
00:05:13,932 --> 00:05:16,232
It's Reaping Day, the place
is crawling with Peacekeepers.

42
00:05:16,345 --> 00:05:17,583
I was gonna sell it.

43
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:19,421
From kisskeepers..

44
00:05:19,597 --> 00:05:20,627
Of course you were.

45
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:22,144
Like you don't sell the Peacekeepers.

46
00:05:22,181 --> 00:05:23,585
No! Not today.

47
00:05:23,621 --> 00:05:25,685
It's the first deer I've seen in a year.

48
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:26,576
Now, I have nothing.

49
00:05:26,578 --> 00:05:27,816
Okay.

50
00:06:18,706 --> 00:06:21,626
What if they did? Just one you.
Why if everyone just stop watching?

51
00:06:21,664 --> 00:06:22,457
They won't, Gale.

52
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:23,725
What if they did? What if we did?

53
00:06:23,763 --> 00:06:25,011
Won't happen.

54
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,999
You root for your favorite, you
cry when they get killed. It's sick.

55
00:06:28,037 --> 00:06:28,829
Gale.

56
00:06:28,831 --> 00:06:29,976
If no one watches...

57
00:06:30,173 --> 00:06:32,408
Then they don't have a
game. It's as simple as that.

58
00:06:32,564 --> 00:06:33,353
What?

59
00:06:33,356 --> 00:06:34,602
Nothing.

60
00:06:35,622 --> 00:06:36,410
Fine, laught at...

61
00:06:36,412 --> 00:06:37,658
I'm not laughing at you.

62
00:06:44,186 --> 00:06:45,601
We could do it, you know?

63
00:06:48,305 --> 00:06:50,809
Take off. Live in the
woods. What we do anyway?

64
00:06:50,846 --> 00:06:51,692
They'd catch us.

65
00:06:51,694 --> 00:06:52,941
Maybe not.

66
00:06:53,908 --> 00:06:55,655
Cut out our tongues or worse.

67
00:06:56,269 --> 00:06:57,515
We wouldn't make it five miles.

68
00:06:57,532 --> 00:06:58,779
No, I get five miles.

69
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,936
We'll go that way.

70
00:07:01,145 --> 00:07:03,109
I have Prim. You have your brothers.

71
00:07:03,147 --> 00:07:04,217
They can come too.

72
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,465
Prim in the woods?

73
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,556
Maybe not.

74
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,864
I'm never having kids.

75
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:14,712
Not might.

76
00:07:14,714 --> 00:07:15,766
If I don't live here.

77
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,803
But you do live here.

78
00:07:16,806 --> 00:07:18,051
I know, but if I didn't.

79
00:07:21,377 --> 00:07:22,624
Oh, I forgot.

80
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:24,452
Here.

81
00:07:24,454 --> 00:07:25,700
Oh my God!

82
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,280
Is this real?

83
00:07:27,282 --> 00:07:28,445
Yeah. Better be.

84
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:29,797
Cost me a squirrel.

85
00:07:31,254 --> 00:07:32,630
Happy Hunger Games.

86
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:34,746
And be the odds be ever in your favor.

87
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,723
How many times did your name in today?

88
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,167
Forty-two?

89
00:07:45,113 --> 00:07:47,150
I guess the odds aren't
exactly in my favor.

90
00:08:15,248 --> 00:08:16,509
Thank you girl.

91
00:08:25,135 --> 00:08:26,398
What's this?

92
00:08:26,948 --> 00:08:28,747
That's a... Mocking Jay.

93
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:32,496
How much?

94
00:08:34,572 --> 00:08:35,549
You keep it.

95
00:08:35,551 --> 00:08:36,813
It's yours.

96
00:08:36,836 --> 00:08:38,099
Thank you.

97
00:08:49,941 --> 00:08:51,191
Mom?

98
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:54,937
Aww. Look at you.

99
00:08:55,324 --> 00:08:57,233
You look beautiful.

100
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,716
Let's better tuck in
that tail by the back.

101
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:01,449
Made something out for you two.

102
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,507
Okay.

103
00:09:30,244 --> 00:09:31,887
How you look beautiful too.

104
00:09:31,924 --> 00:09:33,530
We should oughta pick you.

105
00:09:34,219 --> 00:09:35,752
Oh no.

106
00:09:36,003 --> 00:09:38,016
Here's how it will pick you in the back.

107
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:45,037
Breathe.

108
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,593
Wanna see what I got you today?

109
00:09:49,484 --> 00:09:50,881
It's a Mocking Jay pin.

110
00:09:51,528 --> 00:09:52,781
To protect you.

111
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,399
And as long as you have it.

112
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,612
Nothing bad will happen to you.

113
00:09:58,082 --> 00:09:59,332
Okay?

114
00:09:59,344 --> 00:10:00,595
I promise.

115
00:10:56,453 --> 00:10:57,397
Shh.

116
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:00,096
Shh. Prim, it's okay. It's okay. Shh.

117
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:01,785
Okay, it's time to send her now.

118
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:04,321
Okay, they will prick your finger
to take just a little bit of blood.

119
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:05,162
I'm scared.

120
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,032
Prim, it doesn't hurt
much. Just a little.

121
00:11:07,469 --> 00:11:08,316
Okay?

122
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:09,622
Go sit down there with the little kids.

123
00:11:09,624 --> 00:11:10,923
I'll find you after okay?

124
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,523
Next.

125
00:11:13,271 --> 00:11:14,517
Next.

126
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:27,087
Go ahead.

127
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:28,335
Next.

128
00:11:28,927 --> 00:11:30,171
Next.

129
00:11:40,969 --> 00:11:42,213
Next.

130
00:11:44,685 --> 00:11:45,930
Next.

131
00:12:22,086 --> 00:12:23,316
Welcome.

132
00:12:23,318 --> 00:12:25,204
Welcome. Welcome.

133
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,727
Happy Hunger Games.

134
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:29,154
And...

135
00:12:29,156 --> 00:12:32,596
May the odds be ever in your favor.

136
00:12:34,056 --> 00:12:35,864
Now, before we begin.

137
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:38,063
We have a very special film.

138
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,855
Brought to you all the
way from the Capitol.

139
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,227
War.

140
00:12:50,863 --> 00:12:52,282
Terrible war.

141
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:53,394
With those...

142
00:12:53,396 --> 00:12:55,855
Orphan... and motherless child.

143
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,276
This was the uprising
that brought our land.

144
00:12:59,943 --> 00:13:03,424
13 Districts rebel against
the country that fed them.

145
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:06,158
Protected them.

146
00:13:10,514 --> 00:13:12,129
Then came the peace.

147
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:13,416
Hard fought.

148
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,421
Solely won.

149
00:13:14,423 --> 00:13:15,351
The people.

150
00:13:15,354 --> 00:13:19,105
Rose up from the ashes
and a new era was born.

151
00:13:20,128 --> 00:13:21,961
The freedom has a cost.

152
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,746
And the traitors was defeated.

153
00:13:23,923 --> 00:13:25,591
Peace-War as a nation.

154
00:13:25,696 --> 00:13:28,541
We would never know this treason again.

155
00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:30,626
And so, it was decreed...

156
00:13:30,826 --> 00:13:31,887
That each year.

157
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:35,579
The various districts of Panem
would offer up in tribute...

158
00:13:35,617 --> 00:13:37,217
One young man and woman.

159
00:13:37,255 --> 00:13:38,821
To fight to the death.

160
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:42,773
And it peg you to honor,
courage and sacrifice.

161
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,131
The lone victor...

162
00:13:44,168 --> 00:13:45,418
Bathe in riches...

163
00:13:45,454 --> 00:13:48,892
Will serve as our
reminder of our generosity.

164
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:50,248
.. and our forgiveness.

165
00:13:50,468 --> 00:13:53,063
This is how we remember our past.

166
00:13:53,607 --> 00:13:57,045
This is how we safe guard our future.

167
00:13:57,305 --> 00:13:58,898
I just love that.

168
00:14:01,483 --> 00:14:04,202
Now, the time has come to...

169
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,432
...select...

170
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:09,548
...one courageous young man and woman.

171
00:14:10,446 --> 00:14:13,885
For the honor of representing District

172
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:17,324
12 in the 74th Annual Hunger Games.

173
00:14:18,606 --> 00:14:19,918
As usual...

174
00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:22,002
...ladies first.

175
00:14:47,605 --> 00:14:49,878
Primrose Everdeen!

176
00:14:56,976 --> 00:14:58,225
Where are you?

177
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:00,717
Come on up.

178
00:15:01,594 --> 00:15:02,988
Well, come on up!

179
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:26,789
Prim!

180
00:15:26,955 --> 00:15:28,206
Prim!

181
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:29,622
No!

182
00:15:29,624 --> 00:15:31,906
I volunteer!

183
00:15:33,397 --> 00:15:34,939
I volunteer as Tribute.

184
00:15:36,826 --> 00:15:39,046
I believe we have a volunteer.

185
00:15:40,767 --> 00:15:43,254
- You need to get out of here.
- No!

186
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:44,322
- Go find mom!
- No!

187
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,620
- Prim, go find mom!
- No!

188
00:15:45,643 --> 00:15:46,428
I'm so sorry!

189
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,333
No!

190
00:15:47,335 --> 00:15:48,587
Noo!

191
00:15:48,883 --> 00:15:51,715
Noo! Nooo! Noooo!

192
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,978
In mad of turn of events
here on District 12.

193
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:03,189
District 12's very first
volunteer. Big breath.

194
00:16:07,515 --> 00:16:08,764
Come on dear.

195
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,421
What's your name?

196
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,115
Katniss Everdeen.

197
00:16:22,793 --> 00:16:25,116
Well, I bet my hat that was your sister.

198
00:16:25,154 --> 00:16:26,403
Wasn't it?

199
00:16:27,099 --> 00:16:28,348
Yes.

200
00:16:29,336 --> 00:16:34,567
Let's have a big hand for our very
first volunteer, Katniss Everdeen.

201
00:16:47,824 --> 00:16:49,085
And now...

202
00:16:49,356 --> 00:16:50,751
...for the boys.

203
00:17:00,914 --> 00:17:02,528
Peeta Mellark.

204
00:17:26,236 --> 00:17:27,557
Here we are.

205
00:17:27,943 --> 00:17:31,539
Our Tributes from District 12.

206
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:34,624
Well, go on you two. Shake hands.

207
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,505
Happy Hunger Games.

208
00:17:49,641 --> 00:17:53,746
And be the odds be ever in your favor.

209
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,322
You have 3 minutes.

210
00:18:14,154 --> 00:18:16,234
Prim, Prim, its okay.

211
00:18:16,272 --> 00:18:18,285
Shh. Prim, I don't have much time.

212
00:18:18,453 --> 00:18:19,850
Prim, listen.

213
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,935
You're gonna be okay.

214
00:18:21,937 --> 00:18:23,361
Don't take any extra food for money.

215
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:25,556
That doesn't worth putting
your name in more times, okay?

216
00:18:25,594 --> 00:18:26,846
Listen, Prim.

217
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:29,395
Gale will bring you game. He
stuck cheese from your coat.

218
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,529
Just try to win. Maybe you can.

219
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,930
Maybe I can, I am smart you know?

220
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,733
You can hunt.

221
00:18:38,974 --> 00:18:40,225
Exactly.

222
00:18:46,507 --> 00:18:47,789
It's to protect you.

223
00:18:53,611 --> 00:18:54,862
Thank you.

224
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:09,679
You can't turn out again.

225
00:19:10,588 --> 00:19:11,543
I won't

226
00:19:11,545 --> 00:19:12,964
No, you can't.

227
00:19:13,143 --> 00:19:14,247
Not like when dad died.

228
00:19:14,249 --> 00:19:16,112
I won't be here anymore.
Your all she has.

229
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:19,184
No matter what you feel, you will
be there for her. You understand?

230
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,010
Don't cry.

231
00:19:24,609 --> 00:19:26,423
Don't cry. Don't.

232
00:19:30,097 --> 00:19:30,962
It's time.

233
00:19:30,964 --> 00:19:33,069
It's okay. Prim, it's okay.

234
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,154
No! No!

235
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:37,325
I promise Prim.

236
00:19:54,907 --> 00:19:56,121
I'm fine.

237
00:19:56,158 --> 00:19:57,101
You don't know.

238
00:19:57,103 --> 00:19:58,354
I am.

239
00:19:58,892 --> 00:20:00,295
Listen to me.

240
00:20:00,334 --> 00:20:02,888
You're stronger than they are. You are.

241
00:20:03,347 --> 00:20:06,215
Get to a bow. What will if
you show them how good you are?

242
00:20:06,727 --> 00:20:08,666
They just want a good
show. That's all they want.

243
00:20:09,222 --> 00:20:10,529
If they don't have a
bow, then you make one.

244
00:20:10,531 --> 00:20:11,838
Okay? You know how to hunt.

245
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,819
They're not animals.

246
00:20:15,699 --> 00:20:16,950
It's no different Katniss.

247
00:20:18,943 --> 00:20:21,322
There's 24 of us Gale
and only one comes out.

248
00:20:21,908 --> 00:20:22,949
Yeah.

249
00:20:22,951 --> 00:20:24,327
And it's gonna be you.

250
00:20:24,828 --> 00:20:25,681
Okay.

251
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:26,905
Take care of them Gale.

252
00:20:26,907 --> 00:20:28,157
Whatever you do, don't let them starve.

253
00:20:28,162 --> 00:20:28,966
Let's go!

254
00:20:28,968 --> 00:20:30,450
I'll see you soon okay?

255
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:34,453
You two haven't had trip?

256
00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:36,126
Crystal chandeliers.

257
00:20:36,163 --> 00:20:37,487
Platinum donuts.

258
00:21:39,741 --> 00:21:42,498
200 miles per hour and you
can barely feel a thing.

259
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:45,056
I think its rather a wonderful
thing is about this opportunity...

260
00:21:45,093 --> 00:21:48,764
That even though you're here and even
though it's just for a little while.

261
00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:52,026
You get to enjoy all of this.

262
00:21:55,042 --> 00:21:57,555
I'm going to find Haymitch.

263
00:21:57,592 --> 00:22:00,068
He's probably in the back car.

264
00:22:11,719 --> 00:22:12,968
You even met him?

265
00:22:16,213 --> 00:22:17,464
Haymitch?

266
00:22:22,116 --> 00:22:23,732
You know, Katniss, he is our mentor.

267
00:22:23,826 --> 00:22:25,295
He did witness things once.

268
00:22:32,816 --> 00:22:34,025
Look!

269
00:22:34,027 --> 00:22:35,936
You know if you don't want to
talk, I understand. But I just don't

270
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,842
think there's anything wrong
of getting a little bit of help.

271
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:04,781
Congratulations.

272
00:23:23,995 --> 00:23:25,244
Where's the ice?

273
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,343
I don't... I don't know.

274
00:23:40,847 --> 00:23:42,776
Okay, so uh...

275
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:45,151
...so when do we start?

276
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:45,998
Whoah.

277
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,574
Why so eager?

278
00:23:48,085 --> 00:23:51,173
Most of you are in such a hurry.

279
00:23:51,701 --> 00:23:52,823
Yeah. I wanna know what the plan is.

280
00:23:52,825 --> 00:23:53,980
You're our mentor,
you're supposed to go...

281
00:23:53,982 --> 00:23:55,230
Encore.

282
00:23:55,604 --> 00:23:56,581
Yeah.

283
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:59,451
Our mentor is supposed to tell us how
to get sponsors and give us advice.

284
00:23:59,745 --> 00:24:01,539
Oh, okay.

285
00:24:01,966 --> 00:24:03,217
Ummm...

286
00:24:03,446 --> 00:24:07,734
Embrace the probability
of your immanent death.

287
00:24:08,516 --> 00:24:09,769
I know.

288
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,051
Can your heart...

289
00:24:11,689 --> 00:24:14,265
that there's nothing
I can do to save you.

290
00:24:15,464 --> 00:24:17,153
So why are you here then?

291
00:24:18,592 --> 00:24:19,844
The refreshments.

292
00:24:19,908 --> 00:24:21,241
Okay, I think that's enough.

293
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:27,887
You made me spill my drink.

294
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,679
Over my new pants.

295
00:24:30,766 --> 00:24:31,704
You know...

296
00:24:31,707 --> 00:24:35,230
I think I'll go finish this in my room.

297
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,556
I shouldn't have come around.

298
00:24:52,593 --> 00:24:53,913
What? It's no use.

299
00:24:53,965 --> 00:24:55,247
I'm gonna go talk to him.

300
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,980
We have two... 16 year olds.

301
00:25:09,371 --> 00:25:10,622
Yes.

302
00:25:10,728 --> 00:25:12,624
Do you remember this year?

303
00:25:12,661 --> 00:25:14,523
Aww. One of my favorite years.

304
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:16,041
And one of my favorite arenas.

305
00:25:16,078 --> 00:25:18,832
The use of the rubble, the ruin city.

306
00:25:19,635 --> 00:25:20,749
Very exciting.

307
00:25:20,751 --> 00:25:22,305
From this moment here...

308
00:25:22,342 --> 00:25:23,275
...this moment...

309
00:25:23,277 --> 00:25:25,362
.. is the moment that you never forget.

310
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:26,342
The moment...

311
00:25:26,343 --> 00:25:27,594
...when a Tribute...

312
00:25:27,991 --> 00:25:29,503
...becomes a victor.

313
00:26:04,656 --> 00:26:06,172
You'd freeze to death first.

314
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,654
Because I didn't light a fire.

315
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,412
Now that's a good way to get killed.

316
00:26:09,449 --> 00:26:11,133
What's a good way to get killed?

317
00:26:12,115 --> 00:26:13,564
Oh! Joy.

318
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,399
Why don't you join us?

319
00:26:16,162 --> 00:26:18,843
I'm just saving a life-saving advice.

320
00:26:20,396 --> 00:26:21,627
Like what?

321
00:26:21,629 --> 00:26:23,933
I wa... I was just asking
bout how to find shelter.

322
00:26:24,402 --> 00:26:28,489
Which would come in handy if
in fact you are still alive.

323
00:26:30,554 --> 00:26:31,952
How do you find shelter?

324
00:26:32,778 --> 00:26:34,180
Pass the jam.

325
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,853
How do you find shelter?

326
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,076
Give me a chance to wake up sweetheart.

327
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:41,810
This mentoring is very...

328
00:26:42,499 --> 00:26:44,148
...tax and stuff.

329
00:26:49,593 --> 00:26:51,542
Can you pass the marmalade?

330
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:54,891
That is mahogany.

331
00:26:55,423 --> 00:26:56,601
Look at you!

332
00:26:56,603 --> 00:26:59,115
Just killed a... place mat!

333
00:27:00,556 --> 00:27:02,599
You really wanna know how to stay alive?

334
00:27:04,175 --> 00:27:06,646
You get people to like you.

335
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:08,921
Oh!

336
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:10,934
Not what you're expecting.

337
00:27:12,446 --> 00:27:14,658
When you're in the
middle of the games...

338
00:27:14,695 --> 00:27:17,463
...and you're starving or freezing,

339
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:18,805
some water,

340
00:27:18,842 --> 00:27:21,437
a knife or even some matches can mean

341
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:24,035
the difference between life and death.

342
00:27:24,214 --> 00:27:27,060
And those things only
comes from Sponsors.

343
00:27:27,552 --> 00:27:32,391
And to get Sponsors, you
have to make people like you.

344
00:27:33,257 --> 00:27:35,250
And right now, sweetheart?

345
00:27:36,167 --> 00:27:38,698
You're not off to a really good start.

346
00:27:39,182 --> 00:27:40,653
There it is.

347
00:27:45,962 --> 00:27:47,212
It's huge.

348
00:27:48,393 --> 00:27:50,092
That's incredible.

349
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,227
Come on.

350
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,435
Better keep this knife.

351
00:28:33,887 --> 00:28:35,316
He knows what he's doing.

352
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,910
So now that you've seen...

353
00:28:47,947 --> 00:28:50,692
...what do you think of
this years cropful troops?

354
00:28:50,766 --> 00:28:53,446
Are there any surprises
that we can expect this year?

355
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,634
It's really hard to tell
from a Reaping but I think...

356
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:58,776
...this is a very interesting mix.

357
00:28:58,814 --> 00:28:59,648
Yes.

358
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,910
Whenever you have a volunteer
from an outline district,

359
00:29:01,983 --> 00:29:03,656
it's something you can't ignore.

360
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,197
What's that?

361
00:29:33,977 --> 00:29:35,239
What's that?

362
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,676
We were just saying
we might need to hose

363
00:29:37,678 --> 00:29:39,453
you down again before
we take you to Cinna.

364
00:29:46,404 --> 00:29:49,200
That was all the bravest
thing I've ever seen.

365
00:29:51,052 --> 00:29:52,094
I am Cinna.

366
00:29:52,096 --> 00:29:53,340
Katniss.

367
00:29:53,342 --> 00:29:55,312
I'm sorry that this happened to you.

368
00:29:55,348 --> 00:29:57,452
And I'm here to help
you in any way I can.

369
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:02,046
Most people just congratulate me.

370
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:03,950
I don't see the point in that.

371
00:30:04,922 --> 00:30:06,177
Thank you girl.

372
00:30:14,766 --> 00:30:16,024
What's this?

373
00:30:16,572 --> 00:30:18,363
That's a... Mocking Jay.

374
00:30:20,838 --> 00:30:22,096
How much?

375
00:30:24,163 --> 00:30:25,135
You keep it.

376
00:30:25,137 --> 00:30:26,395
It's yours.

377
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:27,674
Thank you.

378
00:30:36,295 --> 00:30:37,546
So tonight...

379
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,024
...they have the Tribute Parade.

380
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:41,713
Let me take you out and
show you after the wurl.

381
00:30:42,956 --> 00:30:44,665
So you're here to make me look pretty.

382
00:30:44,702 --> 00:30:46,375
I'm here to help you make an impression.

383
00:30:47,282 --> 00:30:50,034
Now usually, they dress people
in their close to their district.

384
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,252
Yeah. We're called minors.

385
00:30:51,254 --> 00:30:52,524
Yeah. But I don't want to do that.

386
00:30:53,787 --> 00:30:55,674
I'm gonna do something
that they're gonna remember.

387
00:30:56,278 --> 00:30:58,300
Did they explain about
trying to get sponsors?

388
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:01,197
Yeah, but I'm not very
good at making friends.

389
00:31:01,553 --> 00:31:02,803
We'll see.

390
00:31:04,692 --> 00:31:06,838
I just think, somebody that brave...

391
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:10,748
...shouldn't be dressed up on
some stupid costume as should they.

392
00:31:14,543 --> 00:31:15,794
I hope not.

393
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,416
It's not real fire. These suits
are built so you won't feel a thing.

394
00:31:28,815 --> 00:31:30,062
That's better on me.

395
00:31:30,148 --> 00:31:31,398
The idea...

396
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:32,868
You ready?

397
00:31:32,879 --> 00:31:33,868
Don't be afraid.

398
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,119
I'm not afraid.

399
00:31:55,386 --> 00:31:58,186
Over one hundred
thousand people, craning

400
00:31:58,188 --> 00:32:00,982
to get a glimpse this year's Tributes...

401
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:04,070
...and the Sponsors get to see
the Tributes for the first time.

402
00:32:04,107 --> 00:32:06,977
The importance of this
moment cannot be over stated.

403
00:32:12,034 --> 00:32:13,544
They're nice.

404
00:32:13,744 --> 00:32:15,922
First cheered on my counting in 15...

405
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:18,609
...14... 13...

406
00:32:21,145 --> 00:32:22,939
Here they are. Here they are.

407
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:24,574
This year's Tributes.

408
00:32:25,273 --> 00:32:26,648
The most exciting run...

409
00:32:26,773 --> 00:32:28,873
...it just gives you goosebumps.

410
00:32:28,911 --> 00:32:30,940
Don't you love, how the stylist...

411
00:32:30,977 --> 00:32:33,157
...they so clearly are able to reflect

412
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,343
the character of each district.

413
00:32:36,793 --> 00:32:38,053
There's District 4!

414
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:39,721
Fishing.

415
00:32:39,722 --> 00:32:40,935
I get it. I like it.

416
00:32:40,937 --> 00:32:42,187
That's very good.

417
00:32:43,183 --> 00:32:44,222
And behind them...

418
00:32:44,224 --> 00:32:48,061
.. we have two power plant workers.

419
00:32:48,097 --> 00:32:49,347
And then...

420
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:52,021
...what is that in the background?

421
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,699
Come on. They'll love it.

422
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:30,450
Now see that? I love that.

423
00:33:30,487 --> 00:33:32,755
Two young people,
holding their hands up!

424
00:33:32,793 --> 00:33:34,724
Saying, "I'm proud,
I'm from District 12!

425
00:33:34,727 --> 00:33:36,659
We will not be overlooked!"

426
00:33:36,742 --> 00:33:38,019
I love that.

427
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:41,257
We're gonna sure we'll be paying
attention to them right now!

428
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:44,719
And we're ready.

429
00:33:45,197 --> 00:33:46,979
President Snow, you're live!

430
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,179
Welcome.

431
00:34:21,923 --> 00:34:23,269
Welcome.

432
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:25,895
Tributes.

433
00:34:26,801 --> 00:34:28,075
We welcome you.

434
00:34:29,773 --> 00:34:31,023
We salute...

435
00:34:31,535 --> 00:34:32,784
...the courage...

436
00:34:33,464 --> 00:34:34,996
...and your sacrifice.

437
00:34:39,227 --> 00:34:40,697
And we wish you...

438
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,389
...happy Hunger Games.

439
00:34:45,046 --> 00:34:49,642
And may the odds be ever in your favor.

440
00:35:01,888 --> 00:35:03,908
That was amazing.

441
00:35:03,945 --> 00:35:07,182
Oh, we are anybody's
going be talking about.

442
00:35:07,411 --> 00:35:08,659
So brave.

443
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,792
Are you sure you're
spinning up a new flame?

444
00:35:10,928 --> 00:35:12,177
Fake flame?

445
00:35:12,593 --> 00:35:13,965
Are you sure?

446
00:35:21,563 --> 00:35:22,809
That's uh...

447
00:35:23,112 --> 00:35:24,599
...let's go upstairs.

448
00:35:29,344 --> 00:35:32,502
So each of the districts
got their own floor and

449
00:35:32,503 --> 00:35:35,658
because you're from 12,
you get the penthouse.

450
00:35:42,256 --> 00:35:43,504
Come on.

451
00:35:47,531 --> 00:35:49,662
So this is the living room.

452
00:35:50,341 --> 00:35:52,731
I know!

453
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,707
Now, your rooms are right over here.

454
00:35:56,023 --> 00:36:00,599
Why don't you go clean yourselves
up a little before dinner.

455
00:37:17,063 --> 00:37:18,309
In two weeks...

456
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,712
...23 of you will be dead.

457
00:37:21,277 --> 00:37:23,105
One of you will be alive.

458
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:25,567
Who that is depends on how well you pay

459
00:37:25,569 --> 00:37:27,894
attention over the next four days.

460
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:30,201
Particularly to what I'm about to say.

461
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:33,268
First. No fighting
with the other Tributes.

462
00:37:33,305 --> 00:37:35,813
You'll have plenty of
time for that in the arena.

463
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:40,390
There are four compulsory exercises,
the rest will be individual training.

464
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:41,542
My advice is...

465
00:37:41,544 --> 00:37:43,504
Don't ignore the survival skills.

466
00:37:43,542 --> 00:37:45,965
Everybody wants to grab a sword but most

467
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:48,391
of you wil die from natural causes.

468
00:37:48,428 --> 00:37:50,192
10% from infection.

469
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:51,958
20% from dehydration.

470
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:54,809
Exposure can kill as easily as a knife.

471
00:38:27,274 --> 00:38:28,374
Where's my knife?

472
00:38:28,604 --> 00:38:29,392
Where did you put it?

473
00:38:29,394 --> 00:38:30,173
I put my knife...

474
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:31,424
Don't touch me...

475
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,098
Fuck! You took my knife!

476
00:38:33,192 --> 00:38:35,198
I didn't touch your knife.
I didn't touch your kni...

477
00:38:35,335 --> 00:38:36,155
You liar.

478
00:38:36,157 --> 00:38:37,234
You little punk!

479
00:38:37,236 --> 00:38:38,483
You took my knife.

480
00:38:38,728 --> 00:38:39,611
Get off me.

481
00:38:39,613 --> 00:38:40,860
Just sit here.

482
00:38:42,963 --> 00:38:44,808
I should better wait for the arena.

483
00:38:44,845 --> 00:38:46,926
You're the first one I
get so watch your back huh!

484
00:38:49,851 --> 00:38:51,145
Everybody back in line.

485
00:38:51,182 --> 00:38:52,575
You know you're next to me Cato!

486
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,549
Busy career.

487
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,726
You know what that is?

488
00:38:55,728 --> 00:38:56,837
From District 1.

489
00:38:56,839 --> 00:38:57,809
...and 2.

490
00:38:57,811 --> 00:39:00,361
They've been trying to be
in a special academy till

491
00:39:00,363 --> 00:39:02,910
they're 18 and they
volunteer. By that point...

492
00:39:03,665 --> 00:39:04,669
...they're pretty lethal.

493
00:39:04,671 --> 00:39:07,245
But they don't receive
any special treatment.

494
00:39:07,283 --> 00:39:09,853
In fact, they're staying at the
exact same apartment as you do.

495
00:39:09,991 --> 00:39:12,696
And I don't think left them
out for dessert and you can.

496
00:39:13,924 --> 00:39:15,444
So how good all that?

497
00:39:16,892 --> 00:39:18,670
Obviously, they're pretty good.

498
00:39:18,672 --> 00:39:20,447
They won in almost several year but...

499
00:39:20,485 --> 00:39:21,743
Almost...

500
00:39:21,938 --> 00:39:23,417
They can be arrogant.

501
00:39:24,331 --> 00:39:28,212
And arrogance can be a big problem.

502
00:39:30,426 --> 00:39:31,685
I hear you can shoot..

503
00:39:34,746 --> 00:39:36,007
I'm alright.

504
00:39:36,018 --> 00:39:37,442
Actually, better than alright.

505
00:39:37,716 --> 00:39:39,258
I fed her by the squirrels.

506
00:39:40,266 --> 00:39:42,782
He say she hits em right
in the eye, everytime.

507
00:39:44,737 --> 00:39:46,318
- Peeta's strong.
- What?

508
00:39:46,327 --> 00:39:47,880
He can throw a 100 pound sack of flour

509
00:39:47,882 --> 00:39:49,221
right in his head. I've seen it.

510
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,734
Okay, well I cannot kill
anybody by a sack of flour.

511
00:39:51,771 --> 00:39:53,369
No, you might have a
better chance at winning

512
00:39:53,371 --> 00:39:54,962
when somebody comes
after you with a knife.

513
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,929
I have no chance of
winning. None! Alright?

514
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:04,571
It's true.

515
00:40:05,107 --> 00:40:06,364
Everybody knows it.

516
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,468
You know what my mother said?

517
00:40:11,537 --> 00:40:14,083
She said, "District 12
might finally have a winner!"

518
00:40:15,431 --> 00:40:16,980
But she wasn't talking about me.

519
00:40:18,556 --> 00:40:19,812
She was talking about you.

520
00:40:25,994 --> 00:40:27,356
I'm not very hungry.

521
00:41:05,591 --> 00:41:06,967
I'm done too.

522
00:41:49,778 --> 00:41:51,274
Throw that metal thing over there.

523
00:41:51,651 --> 00:41:52,908
What?

524
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:56,403
No.

525
00:41:56,405 --> 00:41:57,848
Haymitch says we're
not supposed to show...

526
00:41:57,888 --> 00:41:59,142
I don't care what Haymitch said.

527
00:41:59,147 --> 00:42:01,305
Those guys are looking
at you like you're a meal.

528
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,874
Throw it.

529
00:42:47,486 --> 00:42:48,739
Hi.

530
00:42:49,694 --> 00:42:50,677
Hey.

531
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:51,934
How did you do that?

532
00:42:52,992 --> 00:42:54,248
I uh...

533
00:42:54,332 --> 00:42:56,450
I used to take care of the
cakes down at the bakery.

534
00:42:57,665 --> 00:42:58,920
I'll show you.

535
00:43:01,222 --> 00:43:02,479
See?

536
00:43:03,256 --> 00:43:04,218
Wow.

537
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,474
Yeah.

538
00:43:07,006 --> 00:43:08,878
I think you have a shadow.

539
00:43:34,871 --> 00:43:37,566
Tomorrow. They will
bring you in one by one.

540
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:39,137
And evaluate you.

541
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:43,331
This is important because high
ratings will mean Sponsors.

542
00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:45,988
This is the time to
show them everything.

543
00:43:46,025 --> 00:43:48,608
There'll be a bow, make sure you use it.

544
00:43:48,735 --> 00:43:50,848
Peeta, you make sure
to show your strength.

545
00:43:51,287 --> 00:43:55,384
They'll start with District 1
so the two of you will go last.

546
00:43:56,228 --> 00:43:58,045
Not on my house to put this...

547
00:43:58,082 --> 00:43:59,859
Make sure they remember you!

548
00:44:11,277 --> 00:44:13,470
Katniss Everdeen.

549
00:44:24,952 --> 00:44:26,200
Hey Katniss.

550
00:44:27,211 --> 00:44:28,459
Shoot straight.

551
00:45:28,929 --> 00:45:30,569
Katniss Everdeen.

552
00:45:32,163 --> 00:45:33,432
District 12.

553
00:47:24,481 --> 00:47:25,727
Thank you.

554
00:47:25,853 --> 00:47:27,499
For your consideration.

555
00:47:32,899 --> 00:47:34,051
Are you crazy?

556
00:47:34,053 --> 00:47:35,170
I just got mad.

557
00:47:35,173 --> 00:47:36,421
Mad?!

558
00:47:37,096 --> 00:47:40,839
You realize that your actions
reflect badly on all of us.

559
00:47:40,876 --> 00:47:42,117
Not just you.

560
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:43,567
They just want a good show, it's fine.

561
00:47:43,767 --> 00:47:45,710
How bout just bad manners Cinna?

562
00:47:45,748 --> 00:47:47,105
How bout that?

563
00:47:47,491 --> 00:47:49,040
Well, finally!

564
00:47:49,259 --> 00:47:52,254
I hope you notice, we
have a serious situation.

565
00:47:55,444 --> 00:47:57,544
Nice shooting sweetheart!

566
00:47:58,899 --> 00:48:01,327
Wha.. Wha... What did they...

567
00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:03,755
What did they do when
you shot the apple?

568
00:48:04,176 --> 00:48:05,789
Well, they look pretty startled.

569
00:48:09,233 --> 00:48:11,999
What did you say... "Thanks for... "

570
00:48:12,036 --> 00:48:14,083
...consideration. Genius!

571
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:15,711
Genius.

572
00:48:15,713 --> 00:48:18,046
How do you think you're
gonna find this funny?

573
00:48:18,048 --> 00:48:20,378
If the game makers
decided to take it out...

574
00:48:20,415 --> 00:48:22,012
On who? On her?

575
00:48:22,636 --> 00:48:23,851
On him?

576
00:48:23,853 --> 00:48:25,225
I think they already have.

577
00:48:25,384 --> 00:48:27,995
Loosen your corset and have a drink.

578
00:48:28,288 --> 00:48:31,096
I would have given anything to see it.

579
00:48:32,169 --> 00:48:35,171
As you know the Tributes
are rated on a scale of

580
00:48:35,173 --> 00:48:38,172
1 to 12 after three days
of careful evaluation.

581
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,750
The game keepers would
like to evaluate...

582
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:45,546
From District 1, Marvel.

583
00:48:45,585 --> 00:48:48,465
The score of 9.

584
00:48:48,811 --> 00:48:50,978
Cato, the score of 10.

585
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:53,437
Clove, the score of 10.

586
00:48:54,315 --> 00:48:56,618
Four, score of...

587
00:48:56,713 --> 00:48:58,062
From District 7...

588
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,412
From District...

589
00:49:00,454 --> 00:49:03,207
Rue, the score of 7.

590
00:49:05,188 --> 00:49:06,564
From District 12...

591
00:49:08,076 --> 00:49:11,557
Peeta Mellark...

592
00:49:13,507 --> 00:49:14,758
The score of...

593
00:49:15,291 --> 00:49:16,541
8.

594
00:49:17,574 --> 00:49:19,347
Not bad. Bravo.

595
00:49:24,593 --> 00:49:26,009
And finally...

596
00:49:28,326 --> 00:49:29,938
From District 12...

597
00:49:31,766 --> 00:49:33,453
Katniss Everdeen...

598
00:49:37,489 --> 00:49:38,979
With the score of...

599
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:43,409
...eleven.

600
00:49:49,197 --> 00:49:50,571
Congratulations.

601
00:49:51,033 --> 00:49:52,370
I thought they hated me.

602
00:49:52,408 --> 00:49:53,963
They must have like you girl.

603
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,692
To Katniss Everdeen...

604
00:49:55,728 --> 00:49:58,319
The Girl On Fire!

605
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:02,536
At eleven?

606
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:03,941
She earned it.

607
00:50:03,943 --> 00:50:06,091
She shot an arrow at your head.

608
00:50:06,127 --> 00:50:07,369
Well, t'was an apple.

609
00:50:07,399 --> 00:50:08,637
...near your head.

610
00:50:09,477 --> 00:50:10,720
Sit down.

611
00:50:16,017 --> 00:50:17,257
Seneca...

612
00:50:18,025 --> 00:50:19,827
...why do you think we have a winner?

613
00:50:21,545 --> 00:50:22,789
What do you mean?

614
00:50:23,689 --> 00:50:25,171
I mean...

615
00:50:25,449 --> 00:50:28,101
...why do we have a winner?

616
00:50:30,175 --> 00:50:32,105
I mean if we just wanted to intimidate

617
00:50:32,107 --> 00:50:34,032
the Districts, why not round up

618
00:50:34,034 --> 00:50:37,890
24 of them at random and execute
them all at once. Way a lot faster...

619
00:50:40,741 --> 00:50:41,982
Hope.

620
00:50:42,876 --> 00:50:44,117
Hope?

621
00:50:44,336 --> 00:50:45,579
Hope.

622
00:50:45,745 --> 00:50:49,588
It is the only thing...
stronger than fear.

623
00:50:50,272 --> 00:50:52,060
A little hope is effective.

624
00:50:52,097 --> 00:50:53,846
A lot of hope is dangerous.

625
00:50:54,302 --> 00:50:57,732
It's track is fine.. As
long as it's contained.

626
00:51:00,486 --> 00:51:01,731
So...

627
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:05,604
So... contain it!

628
00:51:36,523 --> 00:51:37,780
Right.

629
00:51:38,156 --> 00:51:41,429
If she's staring at all my jewels,
she can't take her eye from...

630
00:51:41,868 --> 00:51:43,483
Frankly... it was rude.

631
00:51:43,522 --> 00:51:46,017
Oh, Haymitch. You should join us.

632
00:51:46,018 --> 00:51:48,513
We're having some of your favorite dish.

633
00:51:48,888 --> 00:51:50,331
Oh, lovely.

634
00:51:54,121 --> 00:51:55,082
Where's Peeta?

635
00:51:55,084 --> 00:51:57,865
He's in his room. Now listen...

636
00:51:58,297 --> 00:51:59,797
Tomorrow's the last day.

637
00:51:59,835 --> 00:52:02,738
When they let us walk
with our own Tributes right

638
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:05,642
before the game so you and
I will be going down at 9.

639
00:52:07,316 --> 00:52:08,569
Well, what about him?

640
00:52:09,231 --> 00:52:12,485
No, he says he wants to be
trained on his own from now on.

641
00:52:13,961 --> 00:52:15,212
What?

642
00:52:15,622 --> 00:52:18,385
It's kind of thing does happen
at this point if there's...

643
00:52:19,307 --> 00:52:20,884
...only one winner. Right?

644
00:52:27,217 --> 00:52:29,170
We should have some
chocolate covered stoke.

645
00:52:34,197 --> 00:52:37,784
Ladies and gentlemen. Your
master of ceremonies...

646
00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:42,584
Caesar Flickerman!

647
00:52:45,702 --> 00:52:47,469
Thank you!

648
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:51,993
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.

649
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:55,476
To the 74th Annual Hunger Games.

650
00:52:55,612 --> 00:52:59,661
Now, there are five minutes they
are all going to be out here.

651
00:52:59,859 --> 00:53:02,744
All of the Tributes
that you heard about.

652
00:53:02,781 --> 00:53:04,567
Are you excited?

653
00:53:04,605 --> 00:53:06,356
Let me hear it!

654
00:53:09,689 --> 00:53:10,938
Amazing.

655
00:53:12,788 --> 00:53:14,246
I don't feel amazing.

656
00:53:14,363 --> 00:53:15,991
Don't you know how beautiful you look?

657
00:53:16,031 --> 00:53:17,789
No. And I don't know how to make people

658
00:53:17,791 --> 00:53:19,548
like me, how do you
make people like you?

659
00:53:19,621 --> 00:53:20,618
Why do you made me like you?

660
00:53:20,621 --> 00:53:22,349
That's different. I wasn't trying.

661
00:53:22,411 --> 00:53:23,472
Exactly.

662
00:53:23,474 --> 00:53:26,534
Just be yourself. I'll
be there the whole time.

663
00:53:26,573 --> 00:53:28,614
...and just pretend
you're talking to me.

664
00:53:28,886 --> 00:53:30,137
Okay?

665
00:53:30,575 --> 00:53:31,365
Okay.

666
00:53:31,451 --> 00:53:34,190
Let's see if she does indeed shine.

667
00:53:34,193 --> 00:53:36,935
Let's have a warm round
of applause for Glimmer.

668
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:43,181
Glimmer, are you prepared?

669
00:53:43,378 --> 00:53:44,956
Yes Caesar, I am prepared.

670
00:53:44,992 --> 00:53:46,529
I like it, that's just...

671
00:53:52,106 --> 00:53:54,588
Big round of applause.

672
00:53:56,945 --> 00:53:58,195
Marvel!

673
00:54:00,939 --> 00:54:02,691
Welcome Clove.

674
00:54:02,743 --> 00:54:04,087
It's an honor to represent my district.

675
00:54:04,124 --> 00:54:04,908
So you're a fighter?

676
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:07,362
I'm prepared, vicious
and I'm ready to go.

677
00:54:08,427 --> 00:54:09,679
Cato!

678
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:36,089
From District 12...

679
00:54:36,247 --> 00:54:38,411
You know her...

680
00:54:38,447 --> 00:54:43,013
...as the girl on fire!

681
00:54:43,108 --> 00:54:47,258
Where we know it's Katniss Everdeen!

682
00:55:16,018 --> 00:55:17,268
What?

683
00:55:18,613 --> 00:55:20,407
I think someone's a little nervous.

684
00:55:22,544 --> 00:55:24,928
I said that was quite
and entrance that you've

685
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:27,313
made at the Tribute's
Parade the other day.

686
00:55:27,349 --> 00:55:28,598
Do you want to tell us about it?

687
00:55:30,219 --> 00:55:31,605
Well, I was just...

688
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:33,931
...hoping that I wouldn't burned it up!

689
00:55:42,346 --> 00:55:43,972
When you came out of that chariot...

690
00:55:44,012 --> 00:55:45,262
I have to say...

691
00:55:45,453 --> 00:55:47,655
My heart... stopped.

692
00:55:47,793 --> 00:55:50,189
To earn you experiences as well.

693
00:55:50,607 --> 00:55:51,857
My heart stopped.

694
00:55:54,765 --> 00:55:56,129
So did mine.

695
00:55:58,758 --> 00:56:00,751
Now tell me bout the
flames... are they real?

696
00:56:01,471 --> 00:56:02,720
Yes.

697
00:56:07,217 --> 00:56:09,019
In fact I'm wearing them today.

698
00:56:09,864 --> 00:56:11,116
Would you like to see?

699
00:56:12,057 --> 00:56:13,305
Wait, wait, wait.

700
00:56:13,786 --> 00:56:15,036
Is it safe?

701
00:56:16,632 --> 00:56:17,926
What do you think folks?

702
00:56:19,722 --> 00:56:21,211
I think that's a yes!

703
00:56:54,974 --> 00:56:56,466
That was really something.

704
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:58,549
Katniss, that was something.

705
00:56:59,261 --> 00:57:00,634
Thank you for that.

706
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:04,504
I have one more question for you.

707
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:08,195
It's about your sister...

708
00:57:10,855 --> 00:57:13,984
We are all very moved, I think when...

709
00:57:14,725 --> 00:57:17,188
...you volunteered
for her at the Reaping.

710
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:20,887
Does she come to say goodbye to you.

711
00:57:21,932 --> 00:57:23,183
Yes.

712
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:25,046
She did.

713
00:57:27,687 --> 00:57:29,395
And what did you say to her?

714
00:57:29,844 --> 00:57:31,095
In the end?

715
00:57:33,795 --> 00:57:35,839
I told her that I would try to win.

716
00:57:37,635 --> 00:57:39,542
That I will try to win for her.

717
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,512
Of course you did.

718
00:57:44,591 --> 00:57:46,069
And try you will.

719
00:57:47,291 --> 00:57:50,542
Ladies and gentlemen, from District 12,

720
00:57:50,544 --> 00:57:53,798
Katniss Everdeen, The Girl On Fire!

721
00:57:59,924 --> 00:58:01,106
You did it darling.

722
00:58:01,108 --> 00:58:02,283
That was incredible.

723
00:58:02,286 --> 00:58:03,535
Thank you.

724
00:58:03,894 --> 00:58:06,246
Nice job sweetheart.

725
00:58:06,933 --> 00:58:08,152
Thank you.

726
00:58:08,153 --> 00:58:09,919
Nice dress too.

727
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:12,583
Are yours?

728
00:58:12,618 --> 00:58:14,411
Peeta Mellark!

729
00:58:20,732 --> 00:58:22,800
Peeta, welcome.

730
00:58:23,153 --> 00:58:25,779
How are you finding the
Capitol? Don't say with a map.

731
00:58:27,117 --> 00:58:28,576
Uh, it's uh... different.

732
00:58:28,613 --> 00:58:29,850
It's very different.

733
00:58:29,852 --> 00:58:32,225
Different? In what
are? Give us an example.

734
00:58:32,713 --> 00:58:35,407
Uh okay, well the
showers here are weird.

735
00:58:35,483 --> 00:58:36,243
Showers?

736
00:58:36,245 --> 00:58:37,038
Yes.

737
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,286
We have different showers.

738
00:58:38,323 --> 00:58:40,011
I have a question for you Caesar.

739
00:58:40,048 --> 00:58:41,698
Do I smell like roses to you?

740
00:58:44,102 --> 00:58:45,353
Um...

741
00:58:47,545 --> 00:58:48,314
Do I?

742
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:49,110
Yeah.

743
00:58:49,112 --> 00:58:50,377
Do I smell like it?

744
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:58,098
You definitely smell better than I do.

745
00:58:58,135 --> 00:58:59,386
Well I live here longer.

746
00:59:06,107 --> 00:59:07,100
So Peeta...

747
00:59:07,102 --> 00:59:08,354
...tell me.

748
00:59:08,575 --> 00:59:10,664
Is there a special girl back home?

749
00:59:11,093 --> 00:59:13,272
No, not really.

750
00:59:13,309 --> 00:59:16,214
No? I don't believe it for a second.

751
00:59:16,254 --> 00:59:19,363
Look at that face. Handsome
man like you... Peeta.

752
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:21,977
Tell me.

753
00:59:23,819 --> 00:59:25,122
Well, there a...

754
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:27,403
There's this one girl that...

755
00:59:27,442 --> 00:59:29,019
I had a crush on forever.

756
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:34,061
But I don't think she actually
recognize me until the Reaping.

757
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,757
Well...

758
00:59:37,759 --> 00:59:39,246
I'll tell you what Peeta.

759
00:59:40,561 --> 00:59:41,814
You go out there...

760
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:43,989
...and you win this thing.

761
00:59:44,323 --> 00:59:45,684
And when you get home.

762
00:59:45,722 --> 00:59:47,655
She'll have to go out with you.

763
00:59:48,228 --> 00:59:49,482
Right folks?

764
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:54,346
Thanks but I uh...

765
00:59:54,349 --> 00:59:55,955
I don't think winnings
gonna help me at all.

766
00:59:56,282 --> 00:59:57,535
And why not?

767
01:00:01,161 --> 01:00:02,718
Because she came here with me.

768
01:00:07,428 --> 01:00:09,079
Well, that's bad luck.

769
01:00:10,164 --> 01:00:11,460
Yeah. It is.

770
01:00:13,258 --> 01:00:15,262
And I wish you all the best of luck.

771
01:00:15,503 --> 01:00:16,755
Thank you.

772
01:00:17,214 --> 01:00:18,469
Peeta Mellark.

773
01:00:19,778 --> 01:00:21,071
District 12!

774
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:27,061
What the hell is that?!

775
01:00:27,098 --> 01:00:29,211
You don't talk to me and you
say you have a crush on me?

776
01:00:29,249 --> 01:00:31,327
You say you wanna train alone...
is that how you wanna play?

777
01:00:31,362 --> 01:00:32,780
Stop! Stop it!

778
01:00:32,817 --> 01:00:34,202
Start right now.

779
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:36,969
He did you a favor.

780
01:00:36,971 --> 01:00:37,948
He made me look weak.

781
01:00:37,951 --> 01:00:39,592
He made you look desirable.

782
01:00:39,629 --> 01:00:42,022
Which in your case,
can't hurt sweetheart!

783
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:43,201
He's right Katniss.

784
01:00:43,203 --> 01:00:44,431
Of course, I'm right.

785
01:00:44,451 --> 01:00:47,870
Now I can sell the star
cross lovers from District 12.

786
01:00:47,905 --> 01:00:49,313
We are not star cross lovers.

787
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:50,898
It's a television show.

788
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:54,087
And being in love with
that boy might just get

789
01:00:54,089 --> 01:00:56,867
you Sponsors which could
save your damn life.

790
01:00:58,507 --> 01:01:01,127
Okay... why don't you get out of here?

791
01:01:01,648 --> 01:01:04,471
Maybe acting to live save you
both to one piece tomorrow.

792
01:01:04,898 --> 01:01:06,120
Manners.

793
01:01:37,431 --> 01:01:38,674
You too?

794
01:01:39,952 --> 01:01:41,477
Oh, hey.

795
01:01:42,241 --> 01:01:43,434
Can't sleep?

796
01:01:43,436 --> 01:01:45,551
No, of course not.

797
01:01:47,619 --> 01:01:49,442
I'm sorry I went after you.

798
01:01:52,434 --> 01:01:53,885
You know I meant that as a compliment.

799
01:01:55,274 --> 01:01:56,519
I know.

800
01:02:07,608 --> 01:02:08,856
Listen...

801
01:02:11,037 --> 01:02:12,277
Yeah?

802
01:02:16,491 --> 01:02:18,168
I just don't wanna change me.

803
01:02:20,881 --> 01:02:22,139
So tonight...

804
01:02:22,263 --> 01:02:23,625
...they have the Tribute Parade.

805
01:02:24,213 --> 01:02:26,328
Let me take you out and
show you after the wurl.

806
01:02:27,578 --> 01:02:29,296
So you're here to make me look pretty.

807
01:02:29,333 --> 01:02:31,015
I'm here to help you make an impression.

808
01:02:31,928 --> 01:02:34,695
Now usually, they dress people
in their close to their district.

809
01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:35,919
Yeah. We're called minors.

810
01:02:35,921 --> 01:02:37,197
Yeah. But I don't want to do that.

811
01:02:38,467 --> 01:02:40,365
I'm gonna do something
that they're gonna remember.

812
01:02:40,972 --> 01:02:43,005
Did they explain about
trying to get sponsors?

813
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:45,917
Yeah, but I'm not very
good at making friends.

814
01:02:46,275 --> 01:02:47,532
We'll see.

815
01:02:51,031 --> 01:02:52,457
How did they change you?

816
01:02:56,096 --> 01:02:57,348
I don't know.

817
01:02:57,433 --> 01:02:59,185
I'm turning to something I'm not.

818
01:03:01,246 --> 01:03:03,959
I just don't wanna be another
piece in their game, you know?

819
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:08,309
You mean you won't kill anyone?

820
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:11,623
No.

821
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,991
I'm not yet sure I would.

822
01:03:14,231 --> 01:03:16,371
Just like any by off my time came with.

823
01:03:17,726 --> 01:03:19,345
Yeah, I just keep...

824
01:03:19,347 --> 01:03:20,967
wishing I could think
of a way to show them.

825
01:03:21,477 --> 01:03:22,727
That they don't own me.

826
01:03:26,868 --> 01:03:28,678
You know, if I'm gonna die.

827
01:03:29,853 --> 01:03:31,176
I wanna still be me.

828
01:03:36,890 --> 01:03:38,174
Does that make any sense?

829
01:03:38,801 --> 01:03:40,048
Yeah.

830
01:03:42,286 --> 01:03:44,191
I just can't afford to think like that.

831
01:03:48,872 --> 01:03:50,120
I miss my sister.

832
01:03:52,586 --> 01:03:53,837
Yeah I know.

833
01:04:08,415 --> 01:04:09,990
Guess, I'll see you tomorrow.

834
01:04:13,881 --> 01:04:15,129
See you tomorrow.

835
01:04:40,499 --> 01:04:43,014
They put all kind of
stuff right in front.

836
01:04:43,051 --> 01:04:45,340
Right in the mouth of the Curnocopia.

837
01:04:45,748 --> 01:04:47,740
There'll even be a bow there.

838
01:04:47,777 --> 01:04:48,640
Don't go for it.

839
01:04:48,641 --> 01:04:49,603
Why not?

840
01:04:49,605 --> 01:04:51,686
It's a Bloodbath, they're
trying to pull you in.

841
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:53,764
It's not your game.

842
01:04:53,871 --> 01:04:56,613
You turn, run, find a high ground.

843
01:04:56,615 --> 01:04:59,358
Look for water. Water's
your new best friend.

844
01:05:00,553 --> 01:05:04,956
Don't step off that pedestal
earlier or they'll blow you sky high.

845
01:05:04,992 --> 01:05:06,242
I won't.

846
01:05:17,634 --> 01:05:19,053
Katniss.

847
01:05:20,119 --> 01:05:21,745
You can do this.

848
01:05:29,375 --> 01:05:30,628
Thanks.

849
01:05:35,022 --> 01:05:36,332
Give me your arm.

850
01:05:41,169 --> 01:05:42,420
Give me your arm.

851
01:05:49,036 --> 01:05:50,154
Give me your arm.

852
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:51,408
What is that?

853
01:05:53,622 --> 01:05:54,873
Your tracker.

854
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:04,197
Less than a minute people!

855
01:06:04,865 --> 01:06:05,844
Final checks.

856
01:06:05,846 --> 01:06:08,222
So fifteen up, they are flying.

857
01:06:45,638 --> 01:06:46,889
Here.

858
01:07:07,308 --> 01:07:08,561
Thank you.

859
01:07:17,277 --> 01:07:19,184
30 seconds.

860
01:07:25,943 --> 01:07:27,955
I'm not allowed to bet.

861
01:07:28,425 --> 01:07:30,042
But if i could I'd bet on you!

862
01:07:41,856 --> 01:07:44,201
20 seconds.

863
01:07:55,957 --> 01:07:57,956
10 seconds.

864
01:08:23,672 --> 01:08:25,934
Okay, they're in the tubes.

865
01:09:06,073 --> 01:09:07,157
50...

866
01:09:07,159 --> 01:09:08,371
...49...

867
01:09:08,373 --> 01:09:09,511
...48...

868
01:09:09,513 --> 01:09:11,673
...47... 46...

869
01:09:11,756 --> 01:09:13,799
...45... 44...

870
01:09:13,837 --> 01:09:15,882
...43... 42...

871
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,963
...41... 40...

872
01:09:18,005 --> 01:09:20,048
...39... 38...

873
01:09:20,086 --> 01:09:22,138
...37... 36...

874
01:09:22,172 --> 01:09:24,470
...35... 34...

875
01:09:24,508 --> 01:09:26,773
...33... 32...

876
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:28,976
...31... 30...

877
01:09:29,014 --> 01:09:31,062
...29... 28

878
01:09:31,099 --> 01:09:33,195
...27... 26...

879
01:09:33,232 --> 01:09:35,304
...25... 24...

880
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:37,380
...23... 22...

881
01:12:47,001 --> 01:12:48,459
And of course...

882
01:12:49,055 --> 01:12:52,107
There's the familiar boom of the cannon.

883
01:12:52,142 --> 01:12:55,436
Which marks the end of
another fallen Tribute.

884
01:16:27,206 --> 01:16:31,660
Well, that makes 13 gone
in the first eight hours.

885
01:16:31,697 --> 01:16:36,114
And Claudius, I think
I seen alliance forming.

886
01:16:45,242 --> 01:16:47,224
Please don't kill me. Oh no!

887
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:51,511
Hey, loverboy!

888
01:16:52,659 --> 01:16:54,286
You sure she went this way?

889
01:16:54,323 --> 01:16:55,574
Yeah, I'm sure.

890
01:16:56,372 --> 01:16:57,624
You better be.

891
01:16:58,010 --> 01:16:59,700
Yeah. That was a steer comb back there.

892
01:17:06,481 --> 01:17:08,458
Are you sure we shouldn't
just kill him now?

893
01:17:08,494 --> 01:17:10,434
Nah. He's our best
chance at finding her.

894
01:17:32,956 --> 01:17:34,208
Sir.

895
01:17:36,085 --> 01:17:38,505
She is almost at the edge.

896
01:17:38,715 --> 01:17:40,645
Two kilometers away
from the nearest Tribute.

897
01:17:41,448 --> 01:17:42,908
Let's turn her around.

898
01:18:43,328 --> 01:18:45,998
Killing another on my account... one.

899
01:18:46,036 --> 01:18:47,288
Two.

900
01:18:58,162 --> 01:19:00,457
Uh, she's heading
towards the left flank.

901
01:19:00,493 --> 01:19:01,745
Okay.

902
01:19:03,212 --> 01:19:04,463
Sure.

903
01:19:57,258 --> 01:19:58,677
She's almost there.

904
01:20:12,499 --> 01:20:15,920
Lucia, get a cannon ready.

905
01:20:26,643 --> 01:20:28,448
Oh there she is. There she is.

906
01:21:10,738 --> 01:21:12,001
What you got baby?

907
01:21:41,064 --> 01:21:42,326
Kill here Cato!

908
01:21:47,239 --> 01:21:49,189
I'm coming for you!

909
01:21:54,405 --> 01:21:55,698
I'll do it myself.

910
01:22:04,847 --> 01:22:05,650
Get her!

911
01:22:05,651 --> 01:22:06,902
Come on. Come on.

912
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,711
Maybe you should throw the sword.

913
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:13,892
Let's just wait her out.

914
01:22:16,823 --> 01:22:19,149
She's gonna come down at some
points. That's gonne start her there.

915
01:22:25,992 --> 01:22:27,244
Okay.

916
01:22:28,256 --> 01:22:29,528
Somebody make a fire.

917
01:25:21,630 --> 01:25:22,882
Thank you.

918
01:26:05,444 --> 01:26:06,779
Pssst.

919
01:26:08,197 --> 01:26:09,449
Pssst.

920
01:26:33,161 --> 01:26:36,269
Claudius. I think those are
trackerjackers. Am I wrong?

921
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:38,011
Oooh.

922
01:26:39,357 --> 01:26:41,203
Those things are very lethal.

923
01:26:41,454 --> 01:26:42,443
Very.

924
01:26:42,445 --> 01:26:44,656
For those of you who don't know.

925
01:26:44,657 --> 01:26:46,867
Trackerjackers are
genetically engineered wasps.

926
01:26:46,904 --> 01:26:49,188
Whose venom causes serious pain.

927
01:26:49,226 --> 01:26:54,598
Powerful hallucinations
and in extreme cases, death.

928
01:29:53,354 --> 01:29:54,606
Run!

929
01:29:55,263 --> 01:29:56,515
Run!

930
01:29:58,059 --> 01:29:59,237
Run!

931
01:29:59,239 --> 01:30:00,949
Damn it. Go!

932
01:30:02,232 --> 01:30:04,673
Katniss, no! What're you doing?

933
01:30:04,710 --> 01:30:05,988
Go!

934
01:30:16,847 --> 01:30:18,401
Hallow isn't lethal.

935
01:30:18,673 --> 01:30:21,520
But the venom of a
trackerjacker sting...

936
01:30:22,136 --> 01:30:25,672
...is enough to doze off hallucinations.

937
01:31:27,198 --> 01:31:29,128
Please do something.

938
01:31:29,712 --> 01:31:31,444
Katniss, go!

939
01:31:32,727 --> 01:31:36,972
Get out of here! What're you doing? Go!

940
01:32:36,465 --> 01:32:37,716
Rue?

941
01:32:41,169 --> 01:32:43,328
It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.

942
01:33:01,271 --> 01:33:02,522
You want mine too?

943
01:33:03,941 --> 01:33:05,193
No, that's okay.

944
01:33:06,601 --> 01:33:07,853
Here.

945
01:33:08,447 --> 01:33:09,699
Thanks.

946
01:33:14,665 --> 01:33:16,094
How long was I asleep?

947
01:33:16,887 --> 01:33:18,514
A couple of days.

948
01:33:19,046 --> 01:33:20,601
I change your leaves twice.

949
01:33:22,708 --> 01:33:23,959
Thank you.

950
01:33:25,514 --> 01:33:27,422
So what happened? When I was out?

951
01:33:28,748 --> 01:33:31,199
The girl from 1 and the boy from 10.

952
01:33:33,213 --> 01:33:34,464
And the uh...

953
01:33:35,351 --> 01:33:36,926
And the boy from my district?

954
01:33:38,616 --> 01:33:39,868
No, he's okay.

955
01:33:40,212 --> 01:33:41,766
I think he's down by the river.

956
01:33:45,282 --> 01:33:46,565
Is all about true?

957
01:33:47,212 --> 01:33:48,464
What?

958
01:33:48,944 --> 01:33:50,195
You and him.

959
01:33:51,812 --> 01:33:53,429
So where are Cato and the others?

960
01:33:53,919 --> 01:33:56,026
They got all their
supplies down by the lake.

961
01:33:56,652 --> 01:33:58,697
It's prod up in this great big pyramid.

962
01:33:59,563 --> 01:34:00,960
That sounds tempting.

963
01:34:17,109 --> 01:34:19,596
Now this green stuff is
gonna smoke like crazy, so

964
01:34:19,598 --> 01:34:22,085
as soon as you light it.
Move on to the next fire.

965
01:34:22,122 --> 01:34:23,561
Light this one last.

966
01:34:23,598 --> 01:34:25,016
And I'll meet you back over here.

967
01:34:25,053 --> 01:34:26,305
Right.

968
01:34:30,326 --> 01:34:32,412
I'll destroy their stuff
while they're chasing us.

969
01:34:32,548 --> 01:34:34,968
We need a signal, in case
one of us gets held up.

970
01:34:35,004 --> 01:34:36,256
Okay. Like what?

971
01:34:38,411 --> 01:34:39,663
Here. Watch this.

972
01:34:45,786 --> 01:34:47,163
Mocking jays.

973
01:34:47,987 --> 01:34:48,789
That's great.

974
01:34:48,790 --> 01:34:50,855
Back home, we used them
to signal all the time..

975
01:34:56,468 --> 01:34:57,720
You try.

976
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:12,021
Okay so, if we hear that means we're
okay and we'll be back real soon.

977
01:35:12,710 --> 01:35:13,962
We're gonna be okay.

978
01:35:19,814 --> 01:35:21,065
Hey.

979
01:35:21,368 --> 01:35:22,839
I'll see you for supper.

980
01:35:24,310 --> 01:35:26,730
Okay.

981
01:35:54,468 --> 01:35:56,074
Guys, guys look!

982
01:35:56,210 --> 01:35:58,087
Come here. Come on, come on look!

983
01:36:02,532 --> 01:36:03,574
Let's go.

984
01:36:03,575 --> 01:36:05,421
You stay guard over till we get back.

985
01:36:35,339 --> 01:36:38,322
I wanna see if she's gonna
figure out this booby trap.

986
01:36:38,459 --> 01:36:40,858
Yes. It seems they reburied their mines

987
01:36:40,859 --> 01:36:43,257
around that big pile of goodies.

988
01:36:55,514 --> 01:36:58,519
She certainly figure
it out, haven't she?

989
01:40:09,105 --> 01:40:10,367
Katniss!

990
01:40:12,214 --> 01:40:13,632
Katniss!

991
01:40:15,698 --> 01:40:17,325
Katniss help!

992
01:40:18,743 --> 01:40:19,995
Katniss!

993
01:40:24,565 --> 01:40:27,048
Help me! Help!

994
01:40:28,362 --> 01:40:29,614
Katniss!

995
01:40:30,166 --> 01:40:31,470
Katniss!

996
01:40:32,513 --> 01:40:33,765
It's okay.

997
01:40:42,758 --> 01:40:44,009
You're okay.

998
01:40:44,093 --> 01:40:45,062
You're alright.

999
01:40:45,063 --> 01:40:46,732
You're fine.. see?

1000
01:41:15,273 --> 01:41:16,467
It's okay.

1001
01:41:16,468 --> 01:41:17,719
You're okay.

1002
01:41:17,902 --> 01:41:19,154
You're okay.

1003
01:41:19,383 --> 01:41:20,635
You're okay.

1004
01:41:27,666 --> 01:41:29,564
Did you blow up the food?

1005
01:41:32,673 --> 01:41:33,925
Every bit of it.

1006
01:41:37,472 --> 01:41:38,723
Good.

1007
01:41:40,893 --> 01:41:42,823
You have to win.

1008
01:41:57,396 --> 01:41:58,648
Okay.

1009
01:42:06,097 --> 01:42:09,893
Deep in the meadow.

1010
01:42:10,478 --> 01:42:14,118
Under the willow.

1011
01:42:14,848 --> 01:42:18,171
A bed of grass.

1012
01:42:18,207 --> 01:42:22,338
A soft, green pillow.

1013
01:42:23,205 --> 01:42:26,271
Lay down your head.

1014
01:42:26,782 --> 01:42:30,360
And close your eyes.

1015
01:46:25,355 --> 01:46:26,935
Don't kill her.

1016
01:46:26,972 --> 01:46:28,489
You just create a murder.

1017
01:46:28,526 --> 01:46:29,783
It seems I've already got one.

1018
01:46:29,819 --> 01:46:31,864
I heard this rumors out on District 11.

1019
01:46:31,900 --> 01:46:33,303
This could get away from here.

1020
01:46:33,345 --> 01:46:34,701
What do you want?

1021
01:46:35,212 --> 01:46:37,544
There are a lot of anger out there.

1022
01:46:37,545 --> 01:46:39,875
I know you know how to handle
a mod, you've done it before.

1023
01:46:39,990 --> 01:46:45,257
If you can't scare them. Give
them something to root for.

1024
01:46:46,166 --> 01:46:47,418
Such as?

1025
01:46:49,785 --> 01:46:51,037
Young love.

1026
01:46:52,967 --> 01:46:54,818
So you were like an underdog.

1027
01:46:54,855 --> 01:46:56,670
Everyone likes an underdog.

1028
01:46:56,706 --> 01:46:57,958
I don't.

1029
01:46:59,446 --> 01:47:00,854
How many are dead?

1030
01:47:01,208 --> 01:47:02,784
10? 11? 12?

1031
01:47:03,222 --> 01:47:04,097
Uh...

1032
01:47:04,098 --> 01:47:05,558
Not personally, no!

1033
01:47:06,184 --> 01:47:07,436
I have.

1034
01:47:08,708 --> 01:47:10,263
Lots of underdogs.

1035
01:47:10,795 --> 01:47:12,245
Not too cold too.

1036
01:47:12,756 --> 01:47:14,581
Row crops. Minerals.

1037
01:47:15,375 --> 01:47:16,731
Things we need.

1038
01:47:17,847 --> 01:47:20,017
There are lots of underdogs.

1039
01:47:21,154 --> 01:47:23,636
And I think if you could see them.

1040
01:47:24,502 --> 01:47:26,901
You would not root for them either.

1041
01:47:29,509 --> 01:47:30,928
Unlike you..

1042
01:47:34,131 --> 01:47:35,414
Be careful.

1043
01:47:46,502 --> 01:47:48,813
Attention Tributes. Attention!

1044
01:47:48,849 --> 01:47:53,684
The regulations required a single
victor has been... suspended!

1045
01:47:53,721 --> 01:47:57,748
From now on, two victors
maybe crowned if both originate

1046
01:47:57,749 --> 01:48:01,774
from the same district. This
will be the only announcement.

1047
01:49:05,731 --> 01:49:07,306
Oh my God! Peeta!

1048
01:49:07,682 --> 01:49:08,933
Peeta!

1049
01:49:11,729 --> 01:49:12,981
Hi.

1050
01:49:16,132 --> 01:49:17,384
It's okay.

1051
01:49:32,896 --> 01:49:34,147
What was it?

1052
01:49:34,679 --> 01:49:35,931
The sword.

1053
01:49:37,412 --> 01:49:38,664
It's badly hurt.

1054
01:49:40,323 --> 01:49:41,574
It's gonna be fine.

1055
01:49:54,708 --> 01:49:55,960
Katniss...

1056
01:49:59,381 --> 01:50:00,209
Katniss...

1057
01:50:00,210 --> 01:50:01,462
No!

1058
01:50:02,490 --> 01:50:03,773
I'm not gonna leave you!

1059
01:50:04,597 --> 01:50:06,109
I'm not gonna do that.

1060
01:50:13,902 --> 01:50:15,154
Why not?

1061
01:50:35,276 --> 01:50:37,832
Nobody's gonna find you in here.

1062
01:50:38,072 --> 01:50:39,470
They already found me.

1063
01:50:43,654 --> 01:50:45,875
We just get you some medicine.

1064
01:50:46,094 --> 01:50:48,045
He can't. They don't
give so much parachutes.

1065
01:50:49,109 --> 01:50:50,361
We'll figure something out.

1066
01:50:51,383 --> 01:50:52,635
Like what?

1067
01:50:53,553 --> 01:50:54,804
Something.

1068
01:51:56,133 --> 01:51:57,416
Is that medicine?

1069
01:51:57,468 --> 01:51:58,395
No!

1070
01:51:58,396 --> 01:51:59,648
Soup.

1071
01:52:11,259 --> 01:52:12,792
Nice taste.

1072
01:52:14,857 --> 01:52:16,902
Do you fed
- once?

1073
01:52:19,812 --> 01:52:21,565
I think about that all the time.

1074
01:52:23,693 --> 01:52:25,257
How I tossed you that bread.

1075
01:52:25,561 --> 01:52:26,321
Peeta.

1076
01:52:26,322 --> 01:52:28,210
I should've gone to you.

1077
01:52:28,211 --> 01:52:30,098
I should've just gone out to the rain.

1078
01:52:32,852 --> 01:52:34,427
You feel hot.

1079
01:52:36,764 --> 01:52:38,808
I remember the first time I saw you.

1080
01:52:40,227 --> 01:52:42,761
Your hair was in two
braids instead of one.

1081
01:52:43,691 --> 01:52:44,974
I remember when you...

1082
01:52:45,329 --> 01:52:48,114
You sang in music as
simply the teacher said.

1083
01:52:48,134 --> 01:52:51,264
Who knows the pie song in
your head shut straight up!

1084
01:52:52,933 --> 01:52:54,466
After that...

1085
01:52:54,956 --> 01:52:56,928
I watched you going home everyday.

1086
01:52:59,598 --> 01:53:00,850
Everyday.

1087
01:53:08,904 --> 01:53:10,187
Well, say something.

1088
01:53:13,608 --> 01:53:15,235
I'm not gonna say something.

1089
01:53:18,032 --> 01:53:19,284
You can come here.

1090
01:53:21,213 --> 01:53:22,465
Please.

1091
01:53:34,398 --> 01:53:36,537
If I don't even make it.

1092
01:53:44,757 --> 01:53:47,219
Attention Tributes. Attention!

1093
01:53:47,256 --> 01:53:49,050
Commencing Insuberance.

1094
01:53:49,086 --> 01:53:52,080
There will be a feast
tomorrow at the Curnocopia.

1095
01:53:52,394 --> 01:53:55,085
This will be no ordinary occasion.

1096
01:53:55,122 --> 01:53:57,265
Each of you needs something.

1097
01:53:57,302 --> 01:53:58,799
Desperately.

1098
01:53:59,174 --> 01:54:01,302
And we planned to be...

1099
01:54:01,792 --> 01:54:03,107
...generous hosts.

1100
01:54:03,346 --> 01:54:04,598
You rather sit.

1101
01:54:06,079 --> 01:54:08,150
That we needed and you can't walk.

1102
01:54:08,187 --> 01:54:09,574
Promise me, you'll not
gonna risk your life for me.

1103
01:54:09,576 --> 01:54:10,962
I'm not gonna let you.

1104
01:54:11,171 --> 01:54:12,423
You would do it for me.

1105
01:54:13,257 --> 01:54:14,509
Wouldn't you?

1106
01:54:16,073 --> 01:54:17,388
Why are you doing this?

1107
01:54:38,574 --> 01:54:39,668
Peeta!

1108
01:54:39,669 --> 01:54:40,921
Please.

1109
01:54:41,662 --> 01:54:42,914
Stay.

1110
01:54:47,953 --> 01:54:49,204
Okay.

1111
01:54:50,258 --> 01:54:51,729
I'll stay.

1112
01:56:46,655 --> 01:56:47,907
No!

1113
01:56:53,414 --> 01:56:55,010
Where's lover boy?

1114
01:56:58,160 --> 01:57:00,147
Oh I see.

1115
01:57:00,184 --> 01:57:01,947
You're gonna help him right?

1116
01:57:02,605 --> 01:57:03,857
That's sweet.

1117
01:57:04,034 --> 01:57:07,341
Now, it's too bad you couldn't
help your little friend.

1118
01:57:07,737 --> 01:57:10,626
That little girl...
what was her name again?

1119
01:57:11,117 --> 01:57:12,368
Rue?

1120
01:57:14,423 --> 01:57:16,645
Yeah. Well we killed her.

1121
01:57:17,428 --> 01:57:18,888
And now...

1122
01:57:19,358 --> 01:57:21,069
We're gonna kill you...

1123
01:57:26,618 --> 01:57:27,870
You kill her?

1124
01:57:27,907 --> 01:57:29,122
No!

1125
01:57:29,330 --> 01:57:31,359
Cato!

1126
01:57:31,396 --> 01:57:32,647
Shout her name!

1127
01:57:42,798 --> 01:57:44,592
Just this time twelve.

1128
01:57:45,437 --> 01:57:46,689
For Rue!

1129
01:58:02,388 --> 01:58:03,776
Peeta!

1130
01:58:03,812 --> 01:58:05,127
I got it.

1131
01:58:05,163 --> 01:58:06,592
I got the medicine.

1132
01:58:06,629 --> 01:58:07,985
What happened to you?

1133
01:58:08,021 --> 01:58:09,732
No, I'm not. What happened?

1134
01:58:09,847 --> 01:58:11,917
The girl from two, she
threw a knife. I'm okay.

1135
01:58:11,955 --> 01:58:13,874
You shouldn't have gone.
You said you aren't gonna go.

1136
01:58:13,911 --> 01:58:15,162
You got worse.

1137
01:58:22,104 --> 01:58:24,044
You get some of that too.

1138
01:58:24,081 --> 01:58:25,333
I'm okay.

1139
01:58:28,218 --> 01:58:29,469
That feels better.

1140
01:58:31,441 --> 01:58:32,577
Okay.

1141
01:58:32,578 --> 01:58:33,830
Are you?

1142
01:58:34,090 --> 01:58:34,840
I'm okay.

1143
01:58:34,841 --> 01:58:36,166
No, come on. You need it too.

1144
01:58:36,928 --> 01:58:38,179
Come on.

1145
01:59:41,364 --> 01:59:42,616
Oh.

1146
01:59:42,939 --> 01:59:44,191
You're so much better.

1147
01:59:46,872 --> 01:59:48,405
Oh my God, Peeta.

1148
01:59:49,407 --> 01:59:51,253
I couldn't feel anything.

1149
01:59:52,515 --> 01:59:53,767
We could go home.

1150
01:59:55,009 --> 01:59:56,762
We could. With all the team left.

1151
01:59:58,253 --> 01:59:59,505
We could go home.

1152
02:00:04,272 --> 02:00:06,066
We know
- took off.

1153
02:00:06,243 --> 02:00:08,158
Cate's gonna be by the Curnocopia.

1154
02:00:08,159 --> 02:00:10,072
He's not gonna go to
places he doesn't know.

1155
02:00:10,270 --> 02:00:12,158
Fox face, she could be anywhere.

1156
02:00:15,309 --> 02:00:18,376
We should probably hunt around
here. We don't have any food left.

1157
02:00:18,553 --> 02:00:20,462
Okay, uh, I'll take the bow.

1158
02:00:22,548 --> 02:00:23,800
I'm just kidding.

1159
02:00:43,119 --> 02:00:44,371
Peeta?

1160
02:00:48,544 --> 02:00:49,796
Peeta?

1161
02:00:52,978 --> 02:00:54,229
Peeta?

1162
02:00:55,199 --> 02:00:56,419
Peeta?

1163
02:00:56,420 --> 02:00:57,493
Are you okay?

1164
02:00:57,494 --> 02:00:58,976
I hear the cannon.

1165
02:00:59,424 --> 02:01:01,161
That's nightlock Peeta!

1166
02:01:01,197 --> 02:01:02,804
You will be dead in a minute.

1167
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:04,067
I... I didn't know.

1168
02:01:04,069 --> 02:01:05,321
You scare me to death.

1169
02:01:05,538 --> 02:01:06,789
Damn you.

1170
02:01:06,826 --> 02:01:08,078
I'm sorry.

1171
02:01:10,106 --> 02:01:11,358
I'm sorry.

1172
02:01:19,328 --> 02:01:21,330
I don't even knew, she was following me.

1173
02:01:21,842 --> 02:01:23,094
She's clever.

1174
02:01:23,543 --> 02:01:24,794
Too clever.

1175
02:01:26,234 --> 02:01:27,412
What're you doing?

1176
02:01:27,413 --> 02:01:29,186
Maybe Cato likes berries too?

1177
02:01:35,121 --> 02:01:36,373
What time is it?

1178
02:01:36,769 --> 02:01:38,219
A little afternoon.

1179
02:01:38,257 --> 02:01:39,634
Why is it so dark?

1180
02:01:39,670 --> 02:01:41,756
Must be in a hurry to end it.

1181
02:01:44,625 --> 02:01:45,510
Ready Lusia?

1182
02:01:45,512 --> 02:01:46,847
Oh right here sir!

1183
02:01:48,610 --> 02:01:49,861
That's great.

1184
02:01:50,675 --> 02:01:51,979
Can you put that in the middle?

1185
02:01:52,015 --> 02:01:53,267
Sure.

1186
02:02:01,462 --> 02:02:02,713
That's it.

1187
02:02:03,955 --> 02:02:05,551
That's it. Excellent.

1188
02:02:15,816 --> 02:02:17,704
Did you hear that?

1189
02:02:50,804 --> 02:02:52,055
What was that?

1190
02:02:52,932 --> 02:02:54,225
It's the finale.

1191
02:03:10,175 --> 02:03:11,427
Let's go.

1192
02:05:04,787 --> 02:05:06,039
Here.

1193
02:06:18,696 --> 02:06:19,948
Go on.

1194
02:06:20,803 --> 02:06:22,055
Shoot.

1195
02:06:23,849 --> 02:06:25,581
And we both go down and you'd win.

1196
02:06:29,492 --> 02:06:30,744
Go on.

1197
02:06:32,445 --> 02:06:34,177
Dead anyway.

1198
02:06:38,819 --> 02:06:40,133
I always want a drink.

1199
02:06:43,023 --> 02:06:44,525
Until not so now.

1200
02:06:48,436 --> 02:06:50,126
How's that? Is that what you want?

1201
02:06:50,164 --> 02:06:51,415
Huh!

1202
02:06:52,923 --> 02:06:54,174
No!

1203
02:06:56,240 --> 02:06:57,950
I can still do this.

1204
02:06:59,432 --> 02:07:01,351
I can still do it.

1205
02:07:02,279 --> 02:07:03,635
One more kill.

1206
02:07:06,213 --> 02:07:07,851
It's the only thing I know how to do.

1207
02:07:09,081 --> 02:07:11,606
Bring pride to the district.

1208
02:07:15,163 --> 02:07:16,414
Not that it matters.

1209
02:07:44,132 --> 02:07:45,384
Please...!

1210
02:08:32,817 --> 02:08:35,237
Attention. Attention Tributes.

1211
02:08:35,424 --> 02:08:38,731
There has been a slight rule change.

1212
02:08:38,950 --> 02:08:43,102
The previous provision
allowing for two victors

1213
02:08:43,103 --> 02:08:47,253
from the same district has been revoked.

1214
02:08:47,290 --> 02:08:51,853
Only one victor maybe crowned. Goodluck.

1215
02:08:52,772 --> 02:08:55,902
And may the odds be ever in your favor.

1216
02:09:10,610 --> 02:09:11,862
Go ahead.

1217
02:09:15,742 --> 02:09:17,088
One of us should go home!

1218
02:09:18,601 --> 02:09:20,708
One of us has to die. They
had to have their victor.

1219
02:09:22,888 --> 02:09:24,139
No.

1220
02:09:24,996 --> 02:09:26,248
They don't.

1221
02:09:28,219 --> 02:09:29,471
Why should they?

1222
02:09:30,660 --> 02:09:31,493
No!

1223
02:09:31,494 --> 02:09:32,537
Trust me.

1224
02:09:33,174 --> 02:09:34,425
Trust me.

1225
02:09:53,474 --> 02:09:54,725
Together?

1226
02:09:56,342 --> 02:09:57,594
Together.

1227
02:09:58,836 --> 02:10:00,088
Okay.

1228
02:10:00,943 --> 02:10:02,195
One...

1229
02:10:04,500 --> 02:10:05,752
Two...

1230
02:10:11,823 --> 02:10:13,075
Three...

1231
02:10:14,775 --> 02:10:16,027
Stop!

1232
02:10:16,799 --> 02:10:18,051
Stop!

1233
02:10:21,420 --> 02:10:22,672
Ladies and gentlemen.

1234
02:10:23,642 --> 02:10:25,353
May I present the winners...

1235
02:10:25,885 --> 02:10:28,837
.. of the 74th Annual Hunger Games.

1236
02:10:55,522 --> 02:10:57,451
They're not happy with you.

1237
02:10:58,255 --> 02:10:59,757
Why? Because we didn't die?

1238
02:11:01,113 --> 02:11:02,364
Because you showed them all.

1239
02:11:03,366 --> 02:11:04,429
Well..

1240
02:11:04,430 --> 02:11:06,125
I'm sorry it didn't go
the way they planned.

1241
02:11:06,126 --> 02:11:07,820
You know I'm not very
happy with them either.

1242
02:11:07,856 --> 02:11:09,108
Katniss...

1243
02:11:09,250 --> 02:11:10,502
This is serious.

1244
02:11:11,086 --> 02:11:12,478
Not just for you.

1245
02:11:12,515 --> 02:11:14,184
They don't take this things lightly.

1246
02:12:07,563 --> 02:12:11,057
You say you couldn't help
yourself. You're so in love

1247
02:12:11,058 --> 02:12:14,551
with this boy that the dark
have not with the most...

1248
02:12:14,588 --> 02:12:16,278
Unthinkable...

1249
02:12:16,314 --> 02:12:20,414
You rather die... than not
be with him you understand?

1250
02:12:20,451 --> 02:12:21,703
How did you feel?

1251
02:12:22,198 --> 02:12:25,286
When you found him by the river?

1252
02:12:29,573 --> 02:12:32,077
I felt like the happiest
person in the world.

1253
02:12:36,240 --> 02:12:38,148
I couldn't imagine life without him.

1254
02:12:44,741 --> 02:12:47,317
And what about you Peeta?

1255
02:12:47,828 --> 02:12:49,602
Damn, she just saved my life.

1256
02:12:49,638 --> 02:12:50,979
We saved each other.

1257
02:12:52,513 --> 02:12:53,765
Ladies and gentlemen.

1258
02:12:54,359 --> 02:12:58,693
The star cross lovers
of District 12, this

1259
02:12:58,694 --> 02:13:03,028
years victors of the
74th Annual Hunger Games.

1260
02:13:19,510 --> 02:13:20,761
Congratulations.

1261
02:13:21,106 --> 02:13:22,357
Thank you.

1262
02:13:27,970 --> 02:13:29,326
What a lovely pin.

1263
02:13:29,723 --> 02:13:31,632
Thank you, it's from my district.

1264
02:13:33,008 --> 02:13:35,189
They must be very proud of you.

1265
02:13:47,915 --> 02:13:49,522
So what happens when we get back?

1266
02:13:51,691 --> 02:13:52,943
I don't know.

1267
02:13:54,132 --> 02:13:56,020
I guess I may try to forget.

1268
02:14:00,538 --> 02:14:02,353
I don't wanna forget.
