"Some way liquefies"?
Could you be
more specific?

163
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:42,103
<i>Well, to be honest,</i>

164
00:15:42,168 --> 00:15:44,983
<i>we're not quite certain
just how it works.</i>

165
00:15:45,048 --> 00:15:48,113
<i>You know what myelin is?</i>

166
00:15:48,183 --> 00:15:52,754
<i>Myelin is the fatty sheath
that insulates the nerves.</i>

167
00:15:52,823 --> 00:15:55,638
It's a little like plastic
around electrical wires.

168
00:15:55,703 --> 00:15:59,314
Without it, the nerves
cannot conduct an impulse.

169
00:15:59,383 --> 00:16:01,935
What A.L.D. Does is
strip away the myelin.

170
00:16:02,006 --> 00:16:04,177
It corrodes it,
if you like.

171
00:16:04,247 --> 00:16:06,799
This causes degeneration
of the brain.

172
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:11,539
<i>As the brain degenerates,
the body loses its functions.</i>

173
00:16:14,806 --> 00:16:18,601
But surely someone
somewhere must be

How can spinach

make the difference?

211
00:21:37,528 --> 00:21:40,528

that's normally, of course.

Somehow this buildup
strips the myelin covering?

Yes, exactly.
For the moment,
we don't know why this is.

217
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:03,409
But we feel that by
withdrawing the saturated fats
from the diet,

218
00:22:03,476 --> 00:22:06,194
we will prevent them
accumulating in the brain.

00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:28,101
yes.

I have the disease?

248

please be patient.</i>

00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:18,194
<i>Your son has been on
the diet only six weeks.</i>

309
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:22,635
<i>Wait until the end
of the trial.
What about the other boys?</i>

310
00:28:22,707 --> 00:28:25,129
What results are you
seeing in them?

311
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,951
<i>As with Lorenzo,
it's too early to tell.</i>

312
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:31,695
<i>We need the study to run
for the full six months.</i>

313
00:28:31,763 --> 00:28:34,577
That will tell you
what is obvious now,

314
00:28:34,642 --> 00:28:36,497
that avoiding apple skins
and pizza...

315
00:28:36,563 --> 00:28:39,212
<i>has no effect on
this brutal disease.
Augusto...</i>

316
00:28:39,281 --> 00:28:41,137
Please, Doctor,
is there anyone...

317
00:28:41,202 --> 00:28:45,064
who is chasing
a definitive
therapy, hmm?

318
00:28:45,138 --> 00:28:46,992
<i>You judge us
too hastily.</i>

319
00:28:47,057 --> 00:28:49,609
<i>The French have tried
bone marrow transplants.</i>

320
00:28:49,682 --> 00:28:52,648
<i>In Boston, we're about
to try immunosuppression.</i>

321
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,371
Why have we not
heard of this before?

322
00:28:55,441 --> 00:28:57,295
<i>The transplants
were disastrous...</i>

323
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,694
<i>and the immunosuppression
is highly experimental,</i>

324
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,574
<i>so the protocol
has been limited
to six boys,</i>

325
00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:05,934
<i>all more profoundly
afflicted than your son.</i>

326
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,861
For God's sake,
how afflicted
does he need to be?

327
00:29:09,936 --> 00:29:13,131
[Augusto]
It's a school, Lorenzo,

Yes, darling,

Red.

That's right, it's red.

Cyclophosphamides

We're gonna

340
00:29:48,811 --> 00:29:50,983
It's very high-risk.
We're gonna need...

<i>to keep him here

[Leah] That's it.</i>

can all change.

Now, knowing
all of this,

00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,515
do you still want us
to go ahead with it?

346

yes.

Attaboy.

357
00:30:56,902 --> 00:30:59,388
Ten weeks after diagnosis
we observe a hemianopia...

00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,330
with transient
horizontal nystagmus.

they're all doctors and

368
00:31:28,322 --> 00:31:30,330
how to help other boys
in the future.

369
00:31:30,403 --> 00:31:32,824
[Slurred]
Other boys with the boo-boo?

370

Yes, darling.

Now, in the
scanning speech,

374
00:31:42,882 --> 00:31:45,697
we look for both ends
of the pathology:

375
00:31:45,761 --> 00:31:47,866
Centrally,
for the dysphasia;

376
00:31:47,937 --> 00:31:49,945
and peripherally,
for the dysarthria.

377
00:31:50,017 --> 00:31:51,871
Now, Lorenzo,

378
00:31:51,936 --> 00:31:54,325
would you walk
for me, please?

That's right.

That's right.

Two months ago, there
was simply motor lag.

Now, note the
characteristic gait.
[Gasping and Straining]

384
00:32:10,015 --> 00:32:12,982
It's due to hyperreflexia,

00:36:17,001 --> 00:36:19,782
My boy's levels
are rising.
Now there are three.

457
00:36:19,848 --> 00:36:21,920
So, uh,
maybe we should...

458
00:36:21,992 --> 00:36:24,806
Could we have
a show of hands...
Yes.

459
00:36:24,871 --> 00:36:28,613
<i>And see how many
families there are?
This is a formal pilot study.</i>

460
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:31,047
It has to run
the full six months.

461
00:36:31,111 --> 00:36:33,794
<i>We don't
take it on ourselves
to interpret experiments.</i>

462
00:36:33,863 --> 00:36:36,229
<i>That's the responsibility
of the doctors.</i>

463
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:39,523
Come on!
Let's at least have
a show of hands!

464
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:41,445
That would
be misleading.

465
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:44,095
The medical folks call
this evidence anecdotal.

466
00:36:44,165 --> 00:36:47,940
- What's wrong with
a show of hands?
- It wouldn't have any meaning.

467
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:50,340
Excuse me.
May I say something?
Sure.

468
00:36:50,406 --> 00:36:53,721
The only way the doctors
can get useful results...

469
00:36:53,798 --> 00:36:55,653
<i>is with
a strict protocol...</i>

470
00:36:55,717 --> 00:36:59,012
<i>and statistical samples
in a control group.</i>

471
00:36:59,076 --> 00:37:01,760
And a proper time frame.
Doctors have to be
very careful.

472
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:04,676
The clinical trials
must withstand a tremendous
amount of scrutiny.

473
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:07,554
This is the way that
medical science works.

474
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:11,067
That's the only way
scientists can get
the information they need.

475
00:37:11,139 --> 00:37:12,546
So what
you're saying...

476
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:17,053
is that our children
are in the service
of medical science.

477
00:37:17,123 --> 00:37:20,090
How foolish of me.
I assumed medical science...

478
00:37:20,163 --> 00:37:23,010
was in the service
of the sufferers.

479
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:24,929
Yes, uh, thank you.

480
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:28,223
Now I think it's time
we get back to our agenda.

481
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,145
<i>Why, so we
can discuss...</i>

482
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:33,209
further salvaging
our marriages and
managing our grief?

483
00:37:33,281 --> 00:37:35,670
<i>What about
the children?</i>

484
00:37:35,745 --> 00:37:39,541
<i>No one here is
discussing the children.!</i>

485
00:37:39,616 --> 00:37:41,472
Thank you.

486
00:37:41,537 --> 00:37:43,838
If Mary has nothing
further to add,

487
00:37:43,904 --> 00:37:46,392
I would like to
introduce Dr. Chapel...

488
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:49,246
<i>who will talk about
the nasogastric tube
and suction machine.</i>

489
00:37:49,312 --> 00:37:53,916
<i>Would you join me in
giving him a warm welcome?
[Applause]</i>

490
00:37:59,391 --> 00:38:02,773
Thank you, Madame President.
Thank you, Ellie.

491
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:24,151
[Lorenzo]
Now hold my hand.
Yes.

492
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:44,883
Now the story.

493
00:38:44,954 --> 00:38:47,508
What story is that,
sweetheart?

494
00:38:47,578 --> 00:38:50,448
"La Notte
de San Lorenzo."

495
00:38:50,522 --> 00:38:52,530
San Lorenzo who is...

496
00:38:52,602 --> 00:38:54,870
My patron saint...

497
00:38:54,938 --> 00:38:58,866
and saint of
my father's village.
That's right.

498
00:38:58,938 --> 00:39:03,127
And what
happened to him?
He was in Rome...

499
00:39:03,193 --> 00:39:06,127
Mm-hmm?

500
00:39:06,202 --> 00:39:08,819
And I forgot.

501
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:10,744
Mm-hmm. Well,

502
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:13,526
many years ago,
the bad guy...

503
00:39:13,593 --> 00:39:15,448
says to him:

504
00:39:15,513 --> 00:39:18,611
"Bring us the riches
of your church."

505
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:20,884
And Lorenzo,

506
00:39:20,952 --> 00:39:23,188
he brings them
the beggars...

507
00:39:23,255 --> 00:39:25,525
and the sick people,

508
00:39:25,592 --> 00:39:27,479
and he says:

509
00:39:27,543 --> 00:39:29,778
"These are our riches."

510
00:39:29,847 --> 00:39:31,985
Yes. Bravo,
Lorenzino.

511
00:39:32,055 --> 00:39:34,924
Oh, that's wonderful,
sweetheart.
Bravo.

512
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:39,221
So clever.
And tonight,
August 10th is...

513
00:39:39,286 --> 00:39:43,824
La Notte de
S-San Lorenzo.

514
00:39:43,894 --> 00:39:46,709
<i>[Michaela]
The night of
the shooting stars.</i>

515
00:39:46,774 --> 00:39:48,628
<i>[Augusto]
When anything
can happen.</i>

516
00:39:48,693 --> 00:39:51,541
<i>[Italian Opera]</i>

517
00:40:15,988 --> 00:40:17,842
Shh-shh-shh!

518
00:40:19,314 --> 00:40:22,129
When we first went
to the Comoros,

519
00:40:22,195 --> 00:40:24,267
what did we do?

520
00:40:24,337 --> 00:40:27,371
We got to know
the country, right?
Yes.

521
00:40:27,442 --> 00:40:31,915
We studied, we got
to know the language,
resources, its laws.

522
00:40:31,986 --> 00:40:33,873
We studied, right?

523
00:40:33,936 --> 00:40:38,127
We should treat
Lorenzo's illness
like another country.

524
00:40:38,193 --> 00:40:40,266
I don't quite see
the analogy.

525
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:44,559
All right, A.L.D. Has
many dimensions, right?
Yes.

526
00:40:44,624 --> 00:40:46,860
So in order
to understand it,

527
00:40:46,928 --> 00:40:50,409
we need a command of, uh,
genetics, biochemistry,

528
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,546
microbiology, neurology,
- ology, -ology, -ology.

529
00:40:53,615 --> 00:40:56,430
We don't have time to
go to medical school.

530
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:58,916
The doctors
are in the dark.

531
00:40:58,991 --> 00:41:00,846
They're groping
in the dark.

532
00:41:00,911 --> 00:41:03,812
They've got Lorenzo
on a turvy-topsy diet.

533
00:41:03,886 --> 00:41:06,156
And that bloody
immunosuppression,

534
00:41:06,222 --> 00:41:09,003
it's brutal, useless.

535
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,925
Michaela,
we should not...

536
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:14,469
have consigned him
blindly into
their hands.

537
00:41:14,542 --> 00:41:18,087
He should not suffer
by our ignorance.

538
00:41:18,157 --> 00:41:20,394
We take responsibility,

539
00:41:20,461 --> 00:41:23,078
so we read a little...

540
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:26,945
and we go out and
inform ourselves, hmm?

541
00:41:27,021 --> 00:41:30,086
But... to miss
time with him...

542
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:33,635
while he can still speak
to us...
Oh, yes,
I know, I know.

543
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:36,871
But he expects it
of us.

544
00:42:21,225 --> 00:42:23,906
I want to take Lorenzo
off the diet.

545
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:27,520
He's been eating
cardboard for 19 weeks.
What's it getting us?

546
00:42:27,592 --> 00:42:31,933
And feed him what?
Normal foods,
things a child likes.

547
00:42:32,006 --> 00:42:35,169
Full of the long-chain
fats that we know
destroy his myelin?

548
00:42:35,238 --> 00:42:39,035
Look, on the diet, his
blood fats are still rising.

549
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:41,499
Yes, I know.
It doesn't
make any sense.

550
00:42:41,574 --> 00:42:44,770
But we don't know enough.
We don't know enough.

551
00:42:44,837 --> 00:42:47,171
We don't know it
clearly enough.

552
00:42:47,238 --> 00:42:50,717
Here, Michaela, let me
show you something.
All right.

553
00:42:52,325 --> 00:42:54,299
<i>Un piccolo acquaio.</i>

554
00:42:54,373 --> 00:42:58,170
<i>A kitchen sink?
Yes, yes,
a little kitchen sink.</i>

555
00:42:58,244 --> 00:43:01,506
All right.
Now here is the tap...

556
00:43:01,573 --> 00:43:05,248
and here's the sink basin
and the plug hole, right?

557
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:07,171
Very long-chain
saturated fats...

558
00:43:07,235 --> 00:43:10,813
<i>are introduced by
what we eat, all right?
Yes.</i>

559
00:43:10,884 --> 00:43:14,232
Also produced by the body,
or manufactured by the body,

560
00:43:14,307 --> 00:43:16,411
these very same fats.

561
00:43:16,483 --> 00:43:19,231
<i>Biosynthesis.
Biosynthesis, right.
All right.</i>

562
00:43:19,298 --> 00:43:22,910
Now normally they are
not harmful because...

563
00:43:22,977 --> 00:43:26,719
this enzyme eliminate
the excess, right?

564
00:43:26,786 --> 00:43:30,877
But in Lorenzo,
this enzyme is defective
from genetics.

565
00:43:30,946 --> 00:43:34,490
His plug hole
is blocked, right? Hmm?

566
00:43:34,561 --> 00:43:36,895
<i>Yes.
Now, we know that...</i>

567
00:43:36,961 --> 00:43:38,815
very long-chain
saturated fats...

568
00:43:38,881 --> 00:43:41,815
are made up of carbon atoms:
C-2, -4, -6, -8,

569
00:43:41,889 --> 00:43:44,189
all the way up the chain,
all right?

570
00:43:44,256 --> 00:43:48,117
<i>In Lorenzo,
his saturated C-24...</i>

571
00:43:48,191 --> 00:43:50,045
<i>and C-26...</i>

572
00:43:50,111 --> 00:43:54,846
<i>rise to four times
the normal level.</i>

573
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:57,278
[Sighs] Okay, now,

574
00:43:57,342 --> 00:44:01,718
here's where
we have a little paradox,
our mystery, okay?

575
00:44:01,791 --> 00:44:06,525
Why, when we reduce
the dietary intake
of saturated fats,

576
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:08,444
does the level
in our sink,

577
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:12,438
which we would expect
to go down, go up, hmm?

578
00:44:12,509 --> 00:44:16,056
So, logically, we should
take him off the diet.

579
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:18,230
Well, Michaela,

580
00:44:18,301 --> 00:44:21,116
just as logically,
we should not.

581
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,863
Let's not do what
the doctors did.

582
00:44:23,933 --> 00:44:27,707
Let's not act
without knowing why.

583
00:44:27,772 --> 00:44:30,106
Why, when we turn off
this tap,

584
00:44:30,171 --> 00:44:33,652
does the level
in our sink rise, hmm?

585
00:44:35,226 --> 00:44:37,780
<i>I married a plumber.
You married a man...</i>

586
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:41,146
with a simple mind,
who asks simple questions.

587
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:43,764
Here, Michaela,
brain food.

588
00:44:43,835 --> 00:44:46,257
Come on.
Oh, thank you.

589
00:45:42,294 --> 00:45:44,148
Polish rats!

590
00:45:44,213 --> 00:45:46,865
I think I have an explanation
for the paradox.

591
00:45:46,933 --> 00:45:49,802
Lorenzo, kiss
your clever mother.

592
00:45:49,877 --> 00:45:52,975
Polish rats with
a fatty acid
storage disease.

593
00:45:53,045 --> 00:45:56,077
Here, let me use
your kitchen sink.

594
00:45:57,557 --> 00:46:00,818
Here's our tap
for what we eat.
Right.

595
00:46:00,884 --> 00:46:04,199
All right.
And here's our tap...

596
00:46:04,276 --> 00:46:07,276
<i>for biosynthesis.
I see, biosynthesis,
mm-hmm.</i>

597
00:46:08,563 --> 00:46:10,417
When the rats
were deprived...

598
00:46:10,484 --> 00:46:13,298
of a specific fat
in their diet,

599
00:46:13,362 --> 00:46:16,298
their body cells compensated
by overproducing it.

600
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:18,224
If this holds true
for humans...

601
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:20,144
Then the diet
is useless...

602
00:46:20,209 --> 00:46:22,413
unless we can stop it
from overproducing,

603
00:46:22,482 --> 00:46:25,743
slow down biosynthesis,
see?
Yes, yes, and
there's more.

604
00:46:25,809 --> 00:46:28,394
For this, I deserve
two kisses, my darling.

605
00:46:28,465 --> 00:46:30,319
Ah!

606
00:46:30,385 --> 00:46:32,686
<i>In this summary,
it talks about
the concept...</i>

607
00:46:32,721 --> 00:46:36,104
<i>of fatty acid

610

C-24 and C-26...

614
00:46:56,015 --> 00:46:58,503
I have some news
t-t-too.

615
00:46:58,574 --> 00:47:00,429
It's a letter
from Omouri.

616
00:47:00,495 --> 00:47:04,291
<i>He wouldn't open it
until you got home.</i>

<i>will be speaking to us

620
00:47:20,493 --> 00:47:22,467
I've been thinking.

621
00:47:24,363 --> 00:47:28,554
I found that article
by accident. I just as
easily could have missed it.

622
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:33,354
And it was written by a Polish
biochemist, who, I'm sure,
knew nothing about A.L.D.

623
00:47:34,699 --> 00:47:38,244
Well, Michaela,
still it give us
a new line of inquiry.

624
00:47:38,315 --> 00:47:40,387
Yes, of course, but
it could take months,

625
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:44,255
and there will be other leads
and that will take more time,
and it's time we don't have.

626
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:47,232
All these experts,
working in isolation,

627
00:47:47,306 --> 00:47:50,601
each one on his own piece
of the jigsaw.

628

[Indistinct Conversation]

629
00:47:53,065 --> 00:47:57,375
Yes, a symposium is
the best way to accelerate
the exchange of information.

630
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:00,482
In that sense,
it's a very good idea,
Mr. Odone.

631
00:48:00,553 --> 00:48:03,170
Only, uh,
may I say something?

632
00:48:03,241 --> 00:48:06,405
Have you any idea
how many children
in the United States...

633
00:48:06,473 --> 00:48:10,268
die every year from
choking on French fries?

634
00:48:10,343 --> 00:48:15,078
Many more than from
adrenoleukodystrophy.

635
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,794
Ours is what is known
as an orphan disease.

636
00:48:17,864 --> 00:48:21,693
It's too small
to be noticed,
too small to be funded,

637
00:48:21,767 --> 00:48:25,311
especially with
the iron hand
of Reaganomics.

638
00:48:25,383 --> 00:48:28,099
So, while, as I say, this
remains a very good idea,

639
00:48:28,167 --> 00:48:31,942
I'm afraid it's a luxury
we just can't afford.
We appreciate that,

640
00:48:32,006 --> 00:48:34,428
so we have, uh,
prepared a budget...

641
00:48:34,501 --> 00:48:37,371
based on 40 participants
for two days.

642
00:48:37,445 --> 00:48:41,820
We think it can be done
for $35,000. My wife and I
will raise the money.

643
00:48:41,894 --> 00:48:43,900
We can't ask you
to bear the cost.
No, no,

644
00:48:43,941 --> 00:48:47,257
That's out...
no, no, no.
That's the least
of our concerns.

645
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:50,682
And, of course, your institute
will not be at risk,

646
00:48:50,757 --> 00:48:55,489
because the Odones
will underwrite any shortfall.

647
00:48:55,556 --> 00:49:00,290
Hmm? And, uh, we took
the liberty of drafting
an invitation list.

We should notify
the Muscatines.

655
00:49:36,928 --> 00:49:40,671
Of course. Well,
the foundation could help
with the arrangements.

656
00:49:40,736 --> 00:49:43,638
They could even,
perhaps...

657
00:49:43,711 --> 00:49:45,621
find some funds.

658
00:49:45,696 --> 00:49:47,932
Now, how can we
make this work?

659
00:49:47,998 --> 00:49:50,901
How about we hook it
to the back of the next
foundation family conference?

Yes. Monounsaturated C-18.

Yes.

Exactly.

toxic to an intact organism,
an animal or a human.

767

you tell Lorenzo what
an excellent job he did.

you did, Lorenzo.</i>

you truly are.

Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much.

1187

Is this a new hobby
or a nervous tic?

1188
01:24:57,410 --> 01:25:00,637
No, this is a simple mind
at work is all.

1189
01:25:00,705 --> 01:25:03,094
See, each paper clip, Deirdre,

1190
01:25:03,169 --> 01:25:05,950
- is two carbon atoms, right?
- Oh, God.

1191
01:25:06,017 --> 01:25:09,278
<i>No, no, no, really.
It's two carbon atoms,
all right?</i>

1192
01:25:09,344 --> 01:25:13,054
So, we have C-2, C-4,
C-6, you know?

1193
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:16,021
Now here's what I try to do.
I try to make a chain,

1194
01:25:16,095 --> 01:25:19,673
a very long chain,
of monounsaturated fats.

1195
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:23,453
- This is the good guys, right?
- Okay, what are these,
the bad guys?

1196
01:25:23,518 --> 01:25:27,381
<i>Yes. These, these here
is the bad guys.</i>

1197
01:25:27,454 --> 01:25:30,803
All right? Now, Deirdre,
what I'm trying to do,

1198
01:25:30,877 --> 01:25:33,245
I'm trying to understand
the relationship...

1199
01:25:33,309 --> 01:25:36,308
between the good guys
and the bad guys.

1200
01:25:36,382 --> 01:25:39,513
<i>So, okay,
I am the enzyme, right?</i>

1201
01:25:39,581 --> 01:25:42,548
And I reach out
and I grab a carbon atom...

1202
01:25:42,622 --> 01:25:44,889
and I put it on my chain,
right?

1203
01:25:44,957 --> 01:25:49,080
Here's my chain, right?
Now, here, you be
the bad guy enzyme.

1204
01:25:49,149 --> 01:25:52,444
<i>No, no, no.
Do this for me. You be
bad guy enzyme, all right?</i>

1205
01:25:52,508 --> 01:25:57,176
Take these, all right?
Now you reach out and
you grab carbon atom...

1206
01:25:57,245 --> 01:25:59,578
and you put it on
your bad guy chain, okay?

1207
01:25:59,643 --> 01:26:02,458
Oh, Augusto, I had enough
trouble with the kitchen sink.

1208
01:26:02,524 --> 01:26:05,654
No, no, you just do this.
Do this and then I explain,
okay?

1209
01:26:05,722 --> 01:26:10,457
<i>All right, all right.
So let's each start now...</i>

1210
01:26:10,523 --> 01:26:13,370
<i>making our chains, okay?</i>

1211
01:26:13,434 --> 01:26:17,329
<i>All right, putting that on.
That's good, Deirdre. Good.</i>

1212
01:26:17,402 --> 01:26:20,565
- We put another one on...
- Here's your stuff

1213
01:26:20,634 --> 01:26:23,383
<i>Ah, thank you.
Mille grazie.
Prego.</i>

1214
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:26,482
<i>Prego.! Very good.
Now, did you make
the extra copies?</i>

1215
01:26:26,552 --> 01:26:28,408
Oh, you bet.
Oh, thank you
very much.

1216
01:26:28,472 --> 01:26:31,341
For Michaela?
How is she?
She's fine,
she's fine.

1217
01:26:31,416 --> 01:26:35,212
So, here we are.
We're making our chains more
or less the same rate, right?

1218
01:26:35,289 --> 01:26:37,940
Mm-hmm.
That is what
we'd expect, right?

1219
01:26:38,008 --> 01:26:41,074
But now, Deirdre,
if we were enzymes...

1220
01:26:41,144 --> 01:26:44,940
in the bodies of little rats
and little pigs and Lorenzo,

1221
01:26:45,015 --> 01:26:49,358
then, the faster I go,
the more you slow down.

1222
01:26:49,432 --> 01:26:51,535
Now why would that be?

1223
01:26:51,607 --> 01:26:54,956
<i>Why would the faster I go,
why would you slow down...</i>

1224
01:26:55,031 --> 01:26:57,453
if we're both
separate enzymes?

1225
01:26:57,526 --> 01:27:02,162
It means that there has to be
some kind of relationship
going on.

1226
01:27:02,230 --> 01:27:06,637
We affect each other some way.
There's some kind of interplay.

1227
01:27:06,709 --> 01:27:09,612
But what is it?

Michaela! Michaela!
They are the same enzyme!

1241
01:28:11,631 --> 01:28:14,349
There is one enzyme
for both chains!

1242
01:28:14,416 --> 01:28:16,804
It's the same
bloody enzyme!

1243
01:28:17,455 --> 01:28:20,422
So, if we keep the enzyme busy
making monounsaturates...

1244
01:28:20,494 --> 01:28:23,178
It distracts it
from elongating
the saturates.

1245
01:28:23,247 --> 01:28:25,832
Right! So we have a way
to trick nature.

1246
01:28:25,901 --> 01:28:28,488
Yes, it's a principle called
competitive inhibition.

1247
01:28:28,558 --> 01:28:32,169
Right. So, Gus, Gus,
you think it's
a reasonable hypothesis?

1248
01:28:32,238 --> 01:28:36,361
Oh, I think it's more.
What you've done is to clarify
the biochemical pathway.

<i>Augusto, I really want
to congratulate you.</i>

<i>This, this would explain

1251
01:28:43,693 --> 01:28:47,467
Yes, it's C-18, you see.
It's too low down in the chain.
Right, right.

1252
01:28:47,533 --> 01:28:49,572
So, we add
a second barrier.

1253
01:28:49,644 --> 01:28:51,814
We block the bad guys
further up the chain,

1254
01:28:51,884 --> 01:28:55,942
the saturates,
further up the chain
between C-22 and C-24.

1255
01:28:56,011 --> 01:28:58,151
Then, we stop
the bloody things
completely.

1256
01:28:58,219 --> 01:29:01,185
- And how do you do that?
- By adding monounsaturated C-22.

1257
01:29:01,258 --> 01:29:04,193

You, you don't believe
it will work?

1265
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:25,671
Well, I think what
you people have done is
to postulate a theory...

1266
01:29:25,737 --> 01:29:28,104
which could be
of enormous benefit.

it creates cardiac problems

<i>How's the mother tiger?</i>

Augusto didn't
tell you.

1472
01:45:39,825 --> 01:45:42,159
I'm here to be
Lorenzo's rat.

1473
01:45:44,272 --> 01:45:46,858
That's a very kind offer,
but I can't let you.

1474
01:45:46,928 --> 01:45:51,020
I'm a carrier just the same
as you. My blood levels
are just as high as yours.

1475
01:45:51,087 --> 01:45:53,543
I've had
my baseline taken.

1476
01:45:53,616 --> 01:45:55,655
And I'm starving!

1477
01:45:55,727 --> 01:45:59,819
Oh, I have been wanting
to meet Lorenzo's main man.

1478
01:45:59,887 --> 01:46:03,946
<i>[Omouri]

It's good
to meet you too.</i>

<i>[Augusto]
Now, Michaela,
I want no argument.</i>

1481
01:46:08,751 --> 01:46:11,085
Michaela,
you cannot test it.

1482
01:46:11,150 --> 01:46:13,322
Lorenzo needs you
fit and well.

1483
01:46:13,390 --> 01:46:16,619
You would put Dierdre at risk
without discussing it?
Hey, hey.

1484
01:46:16,686 --> 01:46:19,369
Dierdre.
I backpacked
all through India.

1485
01:46:19,437 --> 01:46:22,567
I must've eaten
rapeseed oil up the wazoo.

1486
01:46:22,637 --> 01:46:25,953
Ah, I've been fasting
all day.
All right.
Try it.

1487
01:46:26,029 --> 01:46:28,647
Okay.
Here goes.

taste awful?</i>

No?
Good.
It's good.

1490
01:46:36,780 --> 01:46:38,951
Good.
Eat. Eat.

1491
01:46:43,435 --> 01:46:45,923
<i>[Suddaby]
Your sister had
no side effects?</i>

1492
01:46:45,996 --> 01:46:50,403
<i>None. If we can normalize
the levels of a carrier
so quickly, who knows?</i>

1493
01:46:50,475 --> 01:46:53,290
<i>We're going to start
Lorenzo immediately.
Marvelous.</i>

01:46:53,355 --> 01:46:55,362
<i>We're terribly
grateful to you.
Oh, no, no.</i>

1495
01:46:55,434 --> 01:46:57,343
Not to mention Deedee,

you give the lad?</i>

1498

<i>We don't have time to be

with this blood sample.</i>

You have a problem.
What is the problem?

1506
01:48:23,266 --> 01:48:26,681
<i>Could there have been
a mistake in the labeling?</i>

1507

No! No mistake.
Why?

1508
01:48:29,538 --> 01:48:31,838
<i>We ran the
assay twice...</i>

<i>and the levels of C-24

Now that we have destroyed

I'm sure that Mr. Suddaby

Mama says
this is bootleg.

1530
01:50:02,073 --> 01:50:04,920
Bootleg.
Look, I know this is only a
fraction of what it cost you...

No, no, no!
Wendy, no, no.
You gotta take it, please?

We work on
the barter system.

Our oil.
Your produce.

When are you
gonna tell Nikolais?

1537

We told him and the
other doctors and we
sent all the figures.

1538
01:50:26,231 --> 01:50:30,225
Have you heard back?
They deliberate.
They want more study.

1539
01:50:30,295 --> 01:50:32,433
Wendy, that's enough.
The other kids
have to wait?

1540
01:50:32,502 --> 01:50:35,764
Oh, great.
We know what to do
about that, don't we?

1541
01:50:35,830 --> 01:50:39,027
The doctors had a hard time
swallowing the first oil.

1542
01:50:39,094 --> 01:50:42,476
They want to see how it goes
with Lorenzo on the second.

1543
01:50:42,549 --> 01:50:44,720
But we don't have time,
do we?
No.

1544
01:50:44,790 --> 01:50:48,881
So we leave science

There's no need, Michaela,
not for four hours.

1548
01:51:32,017 --> 01:51:35,017
I turn the machine off.

1549

<i>Augusto?</i>

We hope to make an
announcement quite soon...

1553
01:51:55,919 --> 01:51:59,465
about a new development
in our diet therapy.

1554
01:51:59,535 --> 01:52:02,381
It's going to be
quite expensive.

1555
01:52:02,446 --> 01:52:05,164
With the help of the government
and this wonderful foundation,

1556
01:52:05,230 --> 01:52:09,638
we are going to start a trial
before the end of the year.

[Woman]
Excuse me, Doctor,
are you referring to the oil...

1559
01:52:34,124 --> 01:52:36,425
the Odones have invented
for Lorenzo?

1560
01:52:36,492 --> 01:52:38,696
We'll take
questions later.

1561
01:52:38,763 --> 01:52:40,618
It's all right, Loretta.
It's a good question.

1562
01:52:40,683 --> 01:52:42,690
I should've mentioned
it perhaps, but...

1563
01:52:42,762 --> 01:52:46,504
The Odones have been
extremely active and
we are in their debt.

1564
01:52:46,570 --> 01:52:50,498
<i>It's because of them
that we are now preparing
a protocol for review...</i>

1565
01:52:50,570 --> 01:52:52,903
by the human studies
committee.

1566
01:52:52,970 --> 01:52:56,134
If then we can persuade
the government to fund us,

1567
01:52:56,202 --> 01:52:58,722
then we shall know
whether this oil...

1568
01:52:58,762 --> 01:53:02,622
<i>is of more than temporary
therapeutic value.
But it works.</i>

1569
01:53:02,696 --> 01:53:05,544
The Odones have got
Lorenzo's blood levels
down to normal.

1570
01:53:05,609 --> 01:53:09,319
<i>[Nikolais]
It is for that reason
we are conducting this trial.</i>

1571
01:53:09,385 --> 01:53:12,646
You don't really expect me
to endorse a therapy just...

1572
01:53:12,712 --> 01:53:14,883
on the basis of one
hopeful observation.

1573
01:53:14,953 --> 01:53:18,564
There's two!
My boy's been taking
the oil for six months.

1574
01:53:18,632 --> 01:53:21,381
His blood levels are normal
and he's doing just fine.

1575
01:53:21,447 --> 01:53:23,301
You are playing
with people's hopes.

1576
01:53:23,367 --> 01:53:27,644
Where did these Odones
get off, thinking they
know more than the doctors?

1577
01:53:27,719 --> 01:53:30,206
Where did you get
this oil?
From the Odones.

1578
01:53:30,278 --> 01:53:35,363
<i>They bring it from England.
They don't have approval
from the F.D.A. It is bootleg.</i>

1579
01:53:35,429 --> 01:53:39,652
<i>Give the doctors...
Come on! It's a mixture
of two cooking oils.</i>

1580
01:53:39,719 --> 01:53:41,758
What's the dosage please?
Can you tell me?

1581
01:53:41,829 --> 01:53:44,644
What are the side effects?
How would
we pay for it?

1582
01:53:44,710 --> 01:53:47,294
It must be a formally
approved protocol before
we can raise the funds.

1583
01:53:47,365 --> 01:53:50,714
<i>As I understand it, it will
cost over $ 1,000 a liter.</i>

1584
01:53:50,789 --> 01:53:53,985
Let me say you're not going
to get any insurance company,

1585
01:53:54,053 --> 01:53:56,703
any government to support you
unless you have the approval.

1586
01:53:56,772 --> 01:53:59,228
The only way to get
the approval is through
thorough testing.

1587
01:53:59,300 --> 01:54:03,457
That's what they told
the Al DS people about A.Z.T.
They fought and got it.

1588
01:54:03,524 --> 01:54:07,003
They were dying and
didn't have time to wait!

1589
01:54:07,075 --> 01:54:10,141
We padded our walls yesterday.
I want that oil!

1590
01:54:10,211 --> 01:54:12,512
[Arguing, Shouting]

1591
01:54:20,194 --> 01:54:22,495
There, my darling.

1592
01:54:22,561 --> 01:54:25,595
That's a sweet boy.

1593
01:54:25,666 --> 01:54:28,481
What a big,
strong boy.

1594
01:54:28,545 --> 01:54:32,091
Yes, my darling.
Yes.

1595
01:55:01,758 --> 01:55:03,734
You see, Michaela,

1596
01:55:03,806 --> 01:55:08,410
it is as though he is trapped
down in some dark cave.

1597
01:55:09,438 --> 01:55:12,503
Because he's lost
so much myelin,

1598
01:55:12,574 --> 01:55:14,679
he can't find
his way out.

1599
01:55:14,750 --> 01:55:18,458
We know his simple
functions are intact.

1600
01:55:18,525 --> 01:55:22,715
He breaths. He swallows.
His heart beats.

1601
01:55:22,780 --> 01:55:27,537
From the outside world,
he receives sensation.

1602
01:55:27,612 --> 01:55:30,132
A touch.

1603
01:55:30,204 --> 01:55:32,986
Pain. Cold.

1604
01:55:33,916 --> 01:55:38,387
And here are the
primal feelings: Fear.

1605
01:55:38,459 --> 01:55:40,597
Hunger. Desire.

1606
01:55:41,786 --> 01:55:45,048
Up here in the neocortex,
the higher brain,

1607
01:55:45,114 --> 01:55:47,285
locked here...

1608
01:55:47,353 --> 01:55:52,536
are his reasoning,
imagination and memory,

1609
01:55:52,601 --> 01:55:56,824
the things that make us
each ourselves.

1610
01:56:00,218 --> 01:56:03,087
So, how does
he reach us...

1611
01:56:05,113 --> 01:56:09,620
when a simple swallow
is such a huge task?

1612
01:56:11,768 --> 01:56:14,289
To find...
