10
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,224
- Good morning.
- Good morning, madame.

11
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:24,061
- Good morning.
- Hello.

12
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:30,777
New delivery. I'm sure you've
got some excellent books there.

13
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,890
Got you at last!

14
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:11,312
Not the first time you've stolen
from me, is it, my little thief?!

15
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,322
- Hm? Quick, empty your pockets.
- You're hurting me!

16
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:18,281
Empty your pockets,
or I'll call the Station Inspector.

17
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,116
<i>Do as I say!</i>

18
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,501
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

19
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,712
What are you doing with all these?

20
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,386
- And the other one.
- There's nothing in it.

21
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,215
Where's the Station Inspector?!

22
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,234
Ghosts.

23
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,648
Did you draw these pictures?

24
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,326
Did you draw these pictures?

25
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,080
Where did you steal this?

26
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,584
- I didn't steal it.
- You're a thief and a liar.

27
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,166
- Get out of here.
- Give me my notebook!

28
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,546
It's no longer your notebook!

29
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,379
It is my notebook and I'll do with it
what I like! Maybe I'll just burn it!

30
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,169
- No!
- Then tell me who did the drawings!

31
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,385
Get out of here, you little thief!

32
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,556
Why are you still here?

33
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:14,442
- Go!
- Maximilian, do you hear an atrocity'?

34
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,945
Calamity? Corruption? Go!

35
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,071
Excuse me, excuse me!
Move aside!

36
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,039
Move aside! Gangway!

37
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,246
Move, move!

38
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,093
Stand aside!

39
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,452
What?!

40
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,447
- Ah! A wolf!

41
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,630
Move, move! Ah!

42
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,884
As you were.

43
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,512
Move!

44
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,862
Stop that child! Apprehend!

45
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,694
Monsieur Frick!

46
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,366
Hey! Move aside!

47
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:47,777
Whoa!

48
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,740
- Move!
- Whoa!

49
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,123
- Move!

50
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,081
- Pardon me!

51
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,120
- Sir, move!

52
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,855
Malediction!

53
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,981
Oh! No! Stop the train!

54
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,566
Hold the train! Whoa!

55
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:26,066
Help! Help! Assistance!

56
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,031
Oh! Hold it, hold the train!

57
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,413
Move the bag! Move the bag!

58
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,120
Ohhh! Oh! No!

59
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,398
- Oh, my God! I'm so sorry

60
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:29,235
I'm so sorry.

61
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,657
No, no, no.
That was very, very bad.

62
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,127
I know you're there.

63
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,047
What's your name, boy'?

64
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,681
Hugo. Hugo Cabret.

65
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,308
Stay away from me, Hugo Cabret.

66
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,515
Or I'll drag you
to the Station Inspector's office.

67
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:28,396
He'll lock you up in his little cell,

68
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:32,938
and you'll never get out,
you'll never go to school,

69
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,277
you will never get married
and have children of your own

70
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,818
to take things
that don't belong to them.

71
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,237
Give me back my notebook.

72
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,042
I'm going home to burn your notebook.

73
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:58,593
- You can't burn my notebook.
- And who's to stop me'?

74
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,398
Oh, you look so cold.

75
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:35,060
I'm very hot.
He's really upset me.

76
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:36,603
- Who's really upset you?
- That child.

77
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,681
Who are you?

78
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,309
Your grandfather stole my notebook.

79
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,766
I've got to get it back
before he burns it.

80
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,306
Papa Georges isn't my grandfather.

81
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,521
And he isn't a thief.
You're the thief.

82
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,230
You're nothing but a...

83
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,113
a reprobate.

84
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,195
- You'll have to go.
- Not without my notebook.

85
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,781
Why do you need it so badly'?

86
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,622
I can't tell you.

87
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,872
Is it a secret?

88
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,383
- Yes.
- Oh, good, I love secrets.

89
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,216
- Tell me this instant.
- No.

90
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,635
Well, if you won't tell me,
then you'll have to leave.

91
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,799
- Not without my notebook!
<i>- </i> Shh!

92
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,344
I'll get in trouble.

93
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,226
Just go home.

94
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,823
All right.

95
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,364
I'll make sure he doesn't
burn your notebook.

96
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:09,954
Now go.

97
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,587
What is it?

98
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,840
It's called an automaton.

99
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,718
An aut... An automaton?

100
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:09,096
I found him abandoned
in the attic at the museum.

101
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,350
What does he do?

102
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:18,356
He's a windup figure,
like a music box.

103
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:23,987
This is the most complicated one
I've ever seen... by far.

104
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,072
You see, this one...

105
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:32,120
this one can write.

106
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,665
It must've been made in London.

107
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,371
Where Mother was from.

108
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,918
She was from Coventry, but she...
moved to London.

109
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,254
Magicians used machines like this
when I was a boy.

110
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,715
Some walked, some danced,
some sang.

111
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:53,554
But the secret was always
in the clockwork.

112
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,593
Huh, look at that.

113
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,565
Can we fix him?

114
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:04,398
Oh, I don't know, Hugo.

115
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,779
He's badly rusted.

116
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,611
And finding parts to fit
will be very hard.

117
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,488
Of course we can fix him.

118
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,123
We're clockmakers, aren't we?

119
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,330
But only after I've finished
my work at the shop

120
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:24,498
and at the museum, hmm?
You understand.

121
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,722
We'll put this back in.
Just steady it...

122
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,761
Perfect.

123
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:52,284
You see this?
Another complication.

124
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,319
Another mystery.

125
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,238
That makes you happy.

126
00:19:57,405 --> 00:20:02,036
Mmm. A keyhole
in the shape of a heart.

127
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,078
Unfortunately, we don't have the key.

128
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,191
I fixed the gears and...

129
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,696
Uncle Claude.

130
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,628
There was a fire.

131
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,165
Your father's dead.

132
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:43,220
Pack your things, quickly.
You're coming with me.

133
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:48,937
- Quick!

134
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:02,117
You'll be my apprentice,
and you'll live with me at the station.

135
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,498
And I'll teach you how
to take care of them clocks.

136
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:14,800
These apartments were built for them
that run the station years ago.

137
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:19,346
But every body's forgotten they're here.

138
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,770
Your bed is in the corner, over there.

139
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:32,272
Now get some sleep.
We start work at 5:00.

140
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,400
Oh...

141
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:40,651
- What about school?
- You've finished with school!

142
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:45,911
There'll be no time for that
when you're in them walls.

143
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:54,799
Hugo, without me,
you'd be in the orphanage.

144
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,309
Ah, time...

145
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:10,807
- My time is... 60 seconds in a minute.

146
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,601
Sixty minutes in an hour.

147
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,442
Time is everything.

148
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,357
Everything.

149
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,779
<i>Ah,
time, time, time...</i>

150
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:36,881
OK.

151
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,314
Oh, hello.

152
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,857
- I just thought...

153
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,646
- ...rather nice joke.

154
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,405
- Ah, ah, ah!

155
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,736
Oh, oh!

156
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:04,948
Stop that!
No, Schatzi! Stop it!

157
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,078
- Oh!
- No, no, no, no!

158
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,617
Come back!

159
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,833
Stand back!
He's just a small little dog.

160
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,882
Please be careful!
You've stepped on him!

161
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,802
Don't hurt him!

162
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:19,018
- Good morning!
- Morning, sweetheart.

163
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,067
Hello, how are you?

164
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:25,987
Good morning, sir.
Can I help you with anything?

165
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,527
I'll take these.

166
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,911
I thought I might see you today.

167
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,250
I need my notebook.

168
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,626
Why do you need it so badly'?

169
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,505
To help me...

170
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,258
to fix something.

171
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,337
Go away.

172
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,221
Please just go away.

173
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,317
Wait! Hey!

174
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:28,231
- Sorry, I...
- I saw.

175
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,863
- Are you crying?
- No.

176
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,026
Hold still.

177
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,698
Look, there's nothing wrong with crying.

178
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:42,332
Sydney Carton cries.
And Heathcliff, too.

179
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:46,124
- In books, they're crying all the time.
- I can do it.

180
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,965
I need to talk to you.
It's terribly important, but...

181
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:52,676
But not here. We're too...

182
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:56,933
exposed.

183
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,229
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

184
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,982
Only to the most wonderful
place on earth.

185
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:08,487
It's Neverland and Oz and...
Treasure Island all wrapped into one.

186
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,943
- Good morning, Monsieur Labisse.

187
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,949
Ah, Isabelle.

188
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:16,328
May I present to you
Monsieur Hugo Cabret,

189
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,989
a very old and dear companion.

190
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,080
Monsieur Cabret.

191
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:29,712
Hello.

192
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,383
Well, thank you for this.

193
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:38,346
I think I'm halfway in love with
David Copperfield. Photography'?

194
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:43,435
- Back corner, left, top shelf.
- Thank you.

195
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,527
Listen, what's so important?

196
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,113
Papa Georges still has your notebook.

197
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,699
He didn't burn it.
That was all a trick.

198
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:01,957
- Why?
I don't know.

199
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:05,210
All I know is the notebook
made him very upset.

200
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:08,498
And he and Mama Jeanne stayed up
very late talking about it.

201
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,677
Well, you see, I think he was crying.

202
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,641
Why are you helping me?

203
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:24,062
Because this might be an adventure.

204
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:26,565
And I've never had one before...

205
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,610
outside of books, at least.

206
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:34,273
And I think we should be very...

207
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,868
clandestine.

208
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,490
OK.

209
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:47,662
By the way, my name's Isabelle.
Do you want a book?

210
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:51,958
Monsieur Labisse lets me borrow them,
and I'm sure I could get one for you.

211
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,546
No.

212
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,966
Don't you like books?

213
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,552
No... No, I do.

214
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:04,595
My father and I used to read
Jules Verne together.

215
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:15,401
Well, come on.

216
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,070
How do I get my notebook back?

217
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,952
Well, I think you
should stand up to him.

218
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,284
And don't tell him we talked.

219
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,040
I'll help you if I can.

220
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:27,618
Be steadfast.

221
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,344
Go away.

222
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,564
Fix it.

223
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,327
I said, fix it.

224
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:09,042
I know you've been
stealing parts from the shop.

225
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,624
You might as well use those
you haven't stolen yet.

226
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,186
Give me my notebook.

227
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,568
You've got a bit of talent.

228
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,614
But you'll have to prove there's
more to you than being a thief.

229
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,901
- You can earn your notebook.
- How?

230
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,114
Come to the booth every day.

231
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:28,531
I'll decide how long you must
work for each item you stole.

232
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:31,701
And it will be up to me
to decide when...

233
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,835
you've earned
your notebook, if ever.

234
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:39,045
- I already have a job.
- "Thief" is not a job, boy.

235
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:43,462
I have a different job.
But I'll come when I can.

236
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,137
You begin tomorrow. Go away.

237
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:51,928
I'll begin now.

238
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:03,198
Not that one, the other one.

239
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:00,748
Is this your card?

240
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:39,726
Where is it?

241
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,483
- Little man.

242
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,025
- Ah!

243
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,527
Where are your designated adults?
Answer me!

244
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,789
- Ain't got none.
- Do you have any parents?

245
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,041
- No!
- Excellent.

246
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,873
It's straight to the orphanage
with you, isn't it?

247
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,834
What were you doing
looking in that man's bottle?

248
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:49,374
Was that your...
Was that your bottle?!

249
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,293
as that your paper bag?

250
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,712
Was that your paper bag?
It states clearly...

251
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:58,805
Yes, Gustave Dasté
here. Yes, Officer, another orphan.

252
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:01,720
Um, trespass and theft this time.

253
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,390
His hand was trespassing
inside a paper bag, with the intent

254
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:08,857
- of removing its contents.

255
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:13,068
The object of his plunder? A pastry.

256
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:17,027
Be quiet!

257
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,699
Keep... Stop your sniffling,
you little urchin,

258
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:25,335
- with your filthy little mitts.

259
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,167
No, of course I wasn't talking to you.

260
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,457
I have only the highest respect for you.
Please.

261
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,256
No, that was not a comment
about your wife.

262
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:37,259
- That's absurd.

263
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:41,848
I have not heard any of those rumors.
No, I was not aware of that.

264
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,513
Well, I'm sure she will return.

265
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,556
- Come on, you little vermin.

266
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:48,270
So here's the little
pastry thief, eh?

267
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,777
- This is the one.
- Who's a little strudel thief then?

268
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:53,234
Apologies about your wife.

269
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,239
What do you think I should do about her?

270
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,150
- What? About what?
- Leaving me.

271
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:58,239
- Oy!

272
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,074
- Hey! Come on!
- Nice try.

273
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,952
Go on, get in there!

274
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,116
- Do you think it's mine?
- What?

275
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,411
I don't know what to do.
She's having a baby, you know.

276
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:10,046
- Sure it's yours?
- Who else's could it be?

277
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:13,209
Of course it's yours. When's the last
time you had relations with her?

278
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,422
- Uh...
- Any time in the last year?

279
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:18,805
- No, I don't think so.
- Very suspicious, then.

280
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,965
If you should see her, please...

281
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,805
Oh. You sure you want her back?

282
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,220
Oh, yes, yes.
I love her very much.

283
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,359
Ready?
One, two, three!

284
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:33,566
- Perfect.

285
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,664
<i>Robin Hood.</i>
I saw this movie.

286
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:48,168
With Douglas Fairbanks.
Did you see that?

287
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,670
I've never seen a movie.

288
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:53,127
- What?
- Isn't it appalling?

289
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:56,338
You've never seen <i>a</i> movie?
Not ever?

290
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:58,174
Papa Georges won't let me.

291
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,681
- He's very strict about it.
- I love the movies.

292
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,309
My father always took me
for my birthday.

293
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,557
Hugo...

294
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:14,269
is your father dead?

295
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,655
I don't want to talk about it.

296
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,334
Isabelle...

297
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:36,799
do you want to have
an adventure?

298
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,405
We could get into trouble.

299
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:11,793
That's how you know it's an adventure.

300
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,882
- How did you two rats get in here?!

301
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,088
Come on!

302
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:08,224
And I'd better not see
you in here again!

303
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:16,107
Why doesn't Papa Georges
let you go to the movies?

304
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:19,109
I don't know. He never said.

305
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:21,279
I bet my parents would've let me.

306
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:23,865
What happened to them?

307
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:29,488
They died... when I was a baby.

308
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:32,123
But Papa Georges and Mama Jeanne,
they're my godparents,

309
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:33,874
so they took me in.

310
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:38,083
They're very nice about most everything,
except the movies.

311
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,248
My father took me
to the movies all the time.

312
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:43,965
He told me about the first one
he ever saw.

313
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:47,176
He went into a dark room,
and on a white screen,

314
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:51,969
he saw a rocket fly
into the eye of the man in the moon.

315
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:53,808
- It went straight in.
- Really?

316
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,644
He said it was like seeing
his dreams in the middle of the day.

317
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:00,981
The movies were our special place...

318
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:05,236
where we could go
and watch something and...

319
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,403
we didn't miss my mum so much.

320
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:14,662
You think about him a lot, don't you?

321
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:18,336
All the time.

322
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:25,134
Hugo, um... where do you live?

323
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,191
There.

324
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,357
My uncle taught me
how to run the clocks.

325
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,901
So I just keep on doing it.

326
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:54,114
Maybe he'll come back one day,
but I doubt it.

327
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,496
Aren't you afraid someone will find out?

328
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,537
Not as long as the clocks keep
on running and no one sees me.

329
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,086
- Act natural.
- What?

330
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,926
Just keep on walking.
Act natural.

331
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:13,091
How am I acting now?

332
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:29,445
You two, halt!

333
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,652
Come here.

334
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:40,001
Good day, monsieur.
- Where are your parents?

335
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,747
I work with my Papa Georges
at the toy booth.

336
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:46,007
Surely you've seen me there before.

337
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:49,669
And this is my cousin
from the country, Hugo.

338
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,860
You'll have to forgive him.

339
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:12,526
He's quite... simple-minded.
Doltish, really.

340
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:14,535
Poor thing.

341
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:28,375
Seems Maximilian doesn't like
the cut of your jib, little man.

342
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:31,715
He is disturbed by your physiognomy.

343
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:35,132
He is upset by your visage.

344
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:38,935
Why would he not like your face?

345
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,561
Eh?

346
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:46,522
Well, perhaps he smells my cat.

347
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,571
- Cat?
- Yes.

348
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:54,200
Christina Rossetti's her name,
after the poetess.

349
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:56,911
Would you like me to recite?

350
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,618
My heart is like a singing bird

351
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,249
Whose nest is in a water'd shoot

352
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,911
My heart is like an apple tree

353
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,171
Whose boughs are bent with thick-set...

354
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,628
All right, all right.
I know the rest.

355
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,463
That's enough poetry for today.

356
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:17,349
I love poetry, particularly
that poem by Chris... tina.

357
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:18,598
- Rossetti.
- She's... yeah.

358
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:22,183
She's one of my favorites.
I know it's Rossetti.

359
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,480
I know it's Rossetti.

360
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:27,813
I love poetry, just...
not in the station.

361
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:32,822
We're here to either
get on trains or get off them.

362
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,450
Or work in different shops,
is that clear?

363
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:39,658
- Yes, sir.
- Watch your step.

364
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,077
Go on, go.

365
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:55,504
Doltish?

366
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:00,095
Now, since I just saved your life,

367
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:03,182
how about letting me see
your covert lair?

368
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:08,604
- My what?
- Where you live, in the walls.

369
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:15,823
I have to go now. I have things to do.

370
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:17,404
Hold on!

371
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:22,114
You've seen my house.
Isn't it about time that I saw yours?

372
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,998
After all, I am your only friend.

373
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,658
You're not my only friend.

374
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:28,169
Being enigmatic really doesn't suit you.

375
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:31,001
- What are you up to?
- I've got to go.

376
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,791
I should never have left
the station to begin with.

377
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,947
Hugo!

378
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:19,762
- Where did you get this?
- None of your business.

379
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,924
- I need it.
- What for?

380
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,592
I just need it.

381
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,635
Not unless...

382
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:29,100
Not unless you tell me why.

383
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:36,103
Come.

384
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:49,496
This is marvelous.
I feel just like Jean Valjean.

385
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,554
Oh, this is superlative.

386
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:12,064
What is that?

387
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,021
It's an automaton.

388
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:20,527
My father was fixing it...
before he died.

389
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:34,580
Why would my key fit
into your father's machine?

390
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,211
He looks sad.

391
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:46,640
I think he's just waiting.

392
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:48,472
For what?

393
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:51,767
To work again.

394
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:57,606
To do what he's supposed to do.

395
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,901
What happens when you wind him up?

396
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:07,032
I don't know.

397
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:24,754
What's the matter?

398
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,761
I know it's silly...

399
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:40,195
but I think it's going
to be a message from my father.

400
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:25,192
What an idiot, to think I could fix it.

401
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:31,236
- Hugo...
- It's broken!

402
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,446
It'll always be broken!

403
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,534
- Look...

404
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:47,749
Hugo, look, it doesn't
have to be like this.

405
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:49,667
- You can fix it.
- You don't...

406
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,710
You don't understand.

407
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:54,805
I thought...

408
00:52:56,715 --> 00:53:01,186
if I could fix it,
I wouldn't be so alone.

409
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:11,738
Hugo!

410
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:17,570
Hugo, look! Look, it's not done.
It's not done!

411
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:29,961
It's not writing...

412
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,176
it's drawing.

413
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:13,050
That's the movie
my father saw.

414
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,343
Georges Méliès?

415
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,755
That's Papa Georges' name.

416
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:07,101
Why would your father's machine
sign Papa Georges' name?

417
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:10,607
I don't know.

418
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:26,202
Thank you.

419
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:31,583
It was a message from my father.

420
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,590
And now we have to figure it out.

421
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:48,061
Come on.

422
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:52,812
- Come on.
- Isabelle?

423
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:59,448
Mama Jeanne, we...
We have to talk to you.

424
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:02,863
This is Hugo Cabret.

425
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:06,910
Good evening, ma'am.

426
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:14,212
Very good manners... for a thief.

427
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,957
I'm not a thief.

428
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:25,883
What's going on, Isabelle?

429
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:29,394
Oh, well, it's <i>a</i> terribly long story
filled with circumlocutions,

430
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:31,351
but do you remember
several weeks ago when...

431
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:32,810
Wait!

432
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:57,956
Mama?

433
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,551
Oh, children.

434
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:11,429
What have you done?
Where did you get this?

435
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:14,682
You'll call me a liar.

436
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,521
No, Child.

437
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,317
A mechanical man drew it.

438
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,698
Do you have him?

439
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,360
My father found him in a museum.

440
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,780
Nobody wanted him.

441
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,119
We fixed it.

442
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,751
No, but it needed my...

443
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,622
my key.

444
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:45,300
- The key I gave you.
- No, no, Mama, he...

445
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:49,763
No. No, you take this away.
Can't dredge up the past now.

446
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:52,053
Whatever happens, you don't let
Papa Georges see it.

447
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:54,938
- Please tell us what's going on.
- Out! None of your business.

448
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:56,349
You must both forget this.

449
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:59,564
My father and I,
we worked hard to fix this.

450
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:03,356
This is all I have left of him.

451
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:06,196
I need to know what this means.

452
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,322
Please.

453
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:14,746
There are things
you're too young to understand.

454
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:19,622
You should not yet
know such sadness.

455
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,969
- It's Papa Georges.
- He can't know you're here.

456
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:27,926
Quiet!

457
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:34,054
Now just keep quiet. I'll find a way
to get him out of the apartment.

458
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,181
Not a noise from either of you.

459
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:44,981
She looked at the armoire.

460
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:48,572
I already searched it when
I was looking for your notebook.

461
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:52,663
I'll look again.
You stand guard.

462
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:54,990
Splendid.

463
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:07,010
- Where's Fizzie?
- You just missed her.

464
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:09,388
Not on the stairs? Didn't you
see her when you were going past?

465
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:12,299
- No.
- No? Well, um...

466
00:59:32,861 --> 00:59:34,488
Look.

467
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:43,839
We have to investigate.

468
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:48,051
Let me. I'm taller.

469
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,057
- Knock on it.
- OK.

470
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:55,425
Back from the dead.

471
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:00,976
Stop. Stop, Georges.

472
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:04,479
- Stop it! This is your work!
- My work?!

473
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:06,481
What am I?

474
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:10,895
Nothing but a penniless merchant!
A broken windup toy.

475
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,487
I trusted you.

476
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:22,326
This is how you thank me.

477
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,463
You're cruel.

478
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,134
Cruel.

479
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,246
I should get back.

480
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:11,504
OK.

481
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:27,229
Thank you...

482
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,853
for the movie today. It...

483
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:34,561
It was a gift.

484
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:59,461
Sorry, I...

485
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:09,813
You know this volume?

486
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:14,317
My father and I
used to read it together.

487
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,445
Hmm.

488
01:04:19,898 --> 01:04:23,744
It is intended for... my godson.

489
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:31,167
But now I think it is intended...

490
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:34,921
for you, Monsieur Cabret.

491
01:04:54,516 --> 01:04:55,984
Might I have another cup?

492
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:58,190
Still brewing. Soon.

493
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:05,657
Demitasse, like everything else,
must happen at the opportune moment.

494
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:10,783
If we only knew when that moment was.

495
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:14,579
Oh, Gustave, be intrepid.

496
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,337
Say hello to her.

497
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:20,917
Come on, give me your best smile.

498
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:29,388
Your best smile.

499
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:35,974
It's beautiful.

500
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:38,526
Radiant!

501
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:42,443
Thank you.

502
01:06:08,006 --> 01:06:10,805
- Oh.
- Mademoiselle Lisette.

503
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:14,267
A very gracious good evening to you.

504
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:19,567
- Monsieur Inspector.
- Hmm, yes.

505
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:24,197
Hmm, yes.

506
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:28,360
Those are lovely posies, those.

507
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:30,449
Thank you.

508
01:06:31,446 --> 01:06:33,073
Yes, they're from Gourdon.

509
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:36,209
They come in on the overnight train,
so they're very fresh.

510
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:37,994
Ah, Gourdon.

511
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,964
Splendid country, that.

512
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:43,045
Robust.

513
01:06:46,878 --> 01:06:52,556
The weather...
the cows and such mooing.

514
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:54,811
Perfectly formed udders.

515
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:56,680
Yeah.

516
01:06:57,514 --> 01:07:01,769
Are they... Are they smelly?

517
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:04,112
Are they smelly flowers?

518
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:10,027
Oh, um... yes, a little.
They're... Please.

519
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:35,223
You see, I was injured in the war,
and it will never heal.

520
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:37,387
Good evening, mademoiselle.

521
01:07:40,265 --> 01:07:41,642
I lost my brother.

522
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:47,647
Where?

523
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,908
Verdun.

524
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:13,093
Good evening, Monsieur Inspector.

525
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:19,270
Very good evening,
Mademoiselle Lisette.

<i>by René Tabard...</i>

534
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:18,534
The Story of the First Movies.

535
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:27,539
"In 1895,
one of the very first films ever shown"

536
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:30,049
<i>was called A Train Arrives
in the Station,</i>

537
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:33,929
<i>"which had nothing more than
a train coming into the station."</i>

538
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:41,640
<i>"" When the train came
speeding toward the screen,</i>

539
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:45,023
the audience screamed,
because they thought they

540
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:48,230
- "were in danger of being run over."

541
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,485
"No one had ever seen
anything like it before."

542
01:09:57,026 --> 01:10:00,405
"No one had ever seen
anything like it before."

543
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:11,083
<i>"" What began as a sideshow
novelty soon grew into something more</i>

544
01:10:11,249 --> 01:10:13,502
<i>when the first filmmakers discovered</i>

545
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:17,218
<i>"they could use the new medium
to tell stories. "</i>

546
01:10:26,139 --> 01:10:28,062
Wow.

547
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:03,844
"The filmmaker Georges Méliès..."

548
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:08,223
was one of the first
to realize that...

549
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:11,354
films had the power...

550
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:14,570
"...to capture dreams."

551
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:20,823
"The great pioneer
of early filmmaking died during..."

552
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:25,456
"...the Great War."

553
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:27,037
Died?

554
01:11:28,576 --> 01:11:31,295
- During the Great War?
- You're interested in Méliès?

555
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:33,665
Uh...

556
01:11:34,665 --> 01:11:35,712
yes.

557
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:40,425
It's allowed.

558
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:43,178
IS it?

559
01:11:57,271 --> 01:11:59,114
He's my godfather, you see.

560
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:03,119
And very much alive,
thank you very much.

561
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:09,709
But that's not possible.

562
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:12,625
I assure you, sir...

563
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:14,964
it's true.

564
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:18,547
Why should I believe you?

565
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:22,884
Because...

566
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:26,934
Because it's true.

567
01:12:29,262 --> 01:12:31,014
Méliès alive?

568
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:43,701
Shh!

569
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:46,696
Come with me.

570
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:57,632
Your godfather is a passion of mine.

571
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:00,927
He was a great filmmaker.

572
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:03,463
Here he is at work in his studio.

573
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:09,056
And this is a handbill
from his stage act.

574
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:14,107
Here is the great crystal mystery clock

575
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:17,189
made by his mentor, Robert-Houdin.

576
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:23,908
And this... is one of his
actual cameras.

577
01:13:27,987 --> 01:13:32,993
- He was a magician?
- Yes. He began on the stage.

578
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:35,958
How did he start making movies?

579
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,214
No one really knows.

580
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:42,593
Look how happy he is.

581
01:13:44,045 --> 01:13:49,302
Professor Tabard, would you perhaps...

582
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:52,144
like to meet him?

583
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:59,527
Oh... but you see, I have met him.

584
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:05,779
My brother worked <i>as</i> a carpenter
building sets for Méliès.

585
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:09,162
<i>One day he took me to
visit the studio.</i>

586
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:13,621
<i>It was like...
something out of a dream.</i>

587
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:17,753
<i>The whole building
was made of glass.</i>

588
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:22,509
<i>In reality, this was to let in
all the sunlight necessary for filming,</i>

589
01:14:22,667 --> 01:14:25,420
<i>but to my eyes,
it was nothing short of...</i>

590
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:28,510
<i>an enchanted castle.</i>

591
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:33,352
<i>A palace made of glass.</i>

592
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:49,531
We need more light!

593
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:52,538
- Get the louvers opened.
- Open the louver, please! More!

594
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:57,248
Clear the set, please!
Everybody except actors.

595
01:14:57,410 --> 01:15:00,414
Actors only on the set, please.
Clear the set!

596
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:04,542
Why we doing this again?

597
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:06,461
There was a lobster
in front of a mermaid.

598
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:08,550
OK, if that happens again,
shout "blocked."

599
01:15:08,713 --> 01:15:10,215
If it's clear, give me a "clear."

600
01:15:22,685 --> 01:15:26,531
If you've ever wondered
where your dreams come from...

601
01:15:27,815 --> 01:15:29,067
you look around.

602
01:15:32,987 --> 01:15:34,910
This is where they're made.

603
01:15:38,117 --> 01:15:41,087
Ladies and gentlemen, the sun will set!

604
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:43,464
Knights in position,
lobsters in position.

605
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:45,795
Mermaids in position. Action!

606
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:59,764
<i>In the end,
he made over 500 movies.</i>

607
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:03,601
<i>He was phenomenally
popular in his day.</i>

608
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:08,114
But... why did he stop?

609
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:11,867
Up until today, I believed
that he died in the war...

610
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:14,570
like so many others.

611
01:16:16,906 --> 01:16:19,079
Could we watch some of his movies?

612
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:20,834
I wish you could.

613
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:24,623
But time hasn't been kind to old movies.

614
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:33,673
This is the only one
that we know of that survived.

615
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:38,140
Out of hundreds, one.

616
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:42,522
And Still...

617
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:48,362
it is a masterpiece.

618
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:53,864
We've got to get Tabard
to show Papa Georges the film.

619
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:56,120
Then he'll see he's not forgotten.

620
01:16:57,822 --> 01:16:59,745
Shouldn't I tell Mama Jeanne?

621
01:17:01,408 --> 01:17:05,504
No. I think it should be
a surprise, like a magic trick.

622
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:12,387
We need to have some... panache.

623
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:15,176
Panache.

624
01:17:16,799 --> 01:17:18,096
Well done!

625
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:35,484
Monsieur Claude?

626
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:37,369
Shh.

627
01:17:37,528 --> 01:17:39,622
Are you up there?

628
01:17:41,031 --> 01:17:42,704
Monsieur Claude, was that you?

629
01:17:42,867 --> 01:17:46,212
Keep a grip onto your spanners,
you cack-handed oaf!

630
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:48,839
You can hold onto a bottle
well enough, can't you?

631
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:50,966
Are you inebriated?

632
01:17:51,542 --> 01:17:55,843
Chateauxed, are we?
<i>Shicker?</i> Are you drunk?

633
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:57,966
He's passed out.

634
01:17:58,132 --> 01:17:59,634
He's passed out, isn't he?

635
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:02,519
You bloated buffoon!

636
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:05,564
Could've hurt a child.

637
01:18:18,444 --> 01:18:20,287
What have we here?

638
01:18:20,446 --> 01:18:23,871
Jules Verne. Yes, indeed.

639
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:26,286
- Not unknown in France.
- One of our finest.

640
01:18:26,452 --> 01:18:27,499
Very good plates.

641
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:30,631
Monsieur Labisse gave me
a book the other night.

642
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:34,714
He's always doing that,
sending books to a good home.

643
01:18:34,877 --> 01:18:36,800
That's what he calls it.

644
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:41,843
He's got real...

645
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:43,935
Purpose.

646
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:46,392
What do you mean?

647
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:49,809
Everything has a purpose,
even machines.

648
01:18:49,975 --> 01:18:54,151
Clocks tell the time
and trains take you places.

649
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:56,361
They do what they're meant to do.

650
01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:58,070
Like Monsieur Labisse.

651
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:03,823
Maybe that's why
broken machines make me so sad.

652
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:06,909
They can't do what they're meant to do.

653
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:09,920
Maybe it's the same with people.

654
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:15,256
If you lose your purpose,
it's like you're broken.

655
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:18,633
Like Papa Georges.

656
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:21,765
Maybe we can fix him.

657
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:27,309
Is that your purpose, fixing things?

658
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:29,978
I don't know.

659
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:32,768
It's what my father did.

660
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:36,773
I wonder what my purpose is.

661
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:41,569
I don't know.

662
01:19:43,153 --> 01:19:45,576
Maybe if I had known my parents...

663
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:50,498
I would know.

664
01:19:57,668 --> 01:19:59,011
Come with me.

665
01:20:07,678 --> 01:20:11,774
Right after my father died,
I would come up here a lot.

666
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:17,818
I'd imagine the whole world
was one big machine.

667
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:22,659
Machines never come
with any extra parts, you know.

668
01:20:23,861 --> 01:20:27,240
They always come with
the exact amount they need.

669
01:20:28,365 --> 01:20:32,461
So I figured if the entire world
was one big machine...

670
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,799
I couldn't be an extra part.

671
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:39,961
I had to be here for some reason.

672
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:46,013
And that means you have
to be here for some reason, too.

673
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:04,447
Get back.

674
01:21:07,363 --> 01:21:09,582
I'll bring Tabard
tomorrow night at 7:00.

675
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:12,118
Don't say anything.

676
01:21:13,243 --> 01:21:15,211
Are you sure about this?

677
01:21:16,747 --> 01:21:18,294
Not really.

678
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:23,595
But I think it's the only way to...

679
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:27,258
To fix him.

680
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:52,958
Hello. How was your day'?

681
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:33,763
Boy on the track!
There's a boy on the track!

682
01:23:33,926 --> 01:23:36,520
Get out of the way!
There's a boy!

683
01:23:38,138 --> 01:23:40,766
- Turn it off!

684
01:23:43,936 --> 01:23:47,986
Get out of the way! Move!
Come on!

685
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:53,245
- Out!

686
01:23:59,618 --> 01:24:01,040
Ahh!

687
01:24:11,588 --> 01:24:13,010
Look out!

688
01:26:21,551 --> 01:26:23,224
Morning.

689
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:27,229
Yes, he's employed here.
Large, uncouth man.

690
01:26:28,558 --> 01:26:30,686
In the Seine?

691
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:33,025
Deceased? Are you sure?

692
01:26:37,651 --> 01:26:40,780
No, he has no... no relatives.

693
01:26:42,114 --> 01:26:44,788
Thank you, I'll...
I will gather his belongings.

694
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:47,123
Thank you so much.

695
01:26:55,419 --> 01:26:57,513
If he is deceased...

696
01:26:59,756 --> 01:27:02,930
then who has been
winding the clocks?

697
01:27:20,861 --> 01:27:23,660
Good evening.
- This way, sir.

698
01:27:28,452 --> 01:27:29,874
I'll get it.

699
01:27:35,876 --> 01:27:40,097
Well, what a surprise.
Come in, come in.

700
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:44,342
Isabelle, what's the meaning of this?

701
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:49,898
Please don't be mad, Mama.

702
01:27:50,056 --> 01:27:53,651
That young man is not welcome here.

703
01:27:58,523 --> 01:28:01,572
We found out who Papa Georges is.

704
01:28:04,654 --> 01:28:08,284
I... I deeply apologize, madame.
I thought you were expecting us.

705
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:11,169
I will leave immediately
and return upon your request.

706
01:28:11,328 --> 01:28:13,501
Please keep your voices down.

707
01:28:13,663 --> 01:28:17,088
My husband's sleeping.
He hasn't been well since...

708
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:19,924
No, Mama. Mama, please
don't make them leave.

709
01:28:20,086 --> 01:28:22,509
I-I don't wish to impose
on you, Madame Méliès,

710
01:28:22,672 --> 01:28:25,767
but if this is to be
the only time we meet,

711
01:28:25,926 --> 01:28:29,055
please, let me express to you

712
01:28:29,221 --> 01:28:32,316
the profound debt of gratitude
I owe your husband.

713
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:38,814
When I was a boy,
I saw all his films.

714
01:28:39,898 --> 01:28:41,616
They inspired me.

715
01:28:42,526 --> 01:28:45,200
Your husband is a very great artist.

716
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:56,586
Oh, I am so pleased

717
01:28:56,748 --> 01:29:00,924
you remember my husband's films
with such fondness.

718
01:29:02,295 --> 01:29:06,016
But... he's so fragile now.

719
01:29:08,426 --> 01:29:11,475
It only hurts him to remember the past.

720
01:29:14,057 --> 01:29:15,855
Then we will take our leave, madame.

721
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:22,695
And I do hope you'll
forgive me for saying...

722
01:29:24,568 --> 01:29:28,539
you are as lovely now
as you were in the movies.

723
01:29:30,156 --> 01:29:34,411
Mama?
- You were in the movies?

724
01:29:34,578 --> 01:29:37,047
She appeared in almost all his films.

725
01:29:37,956 --> 01:29:42,336
- You were an actress?
- Well, I...

726
01:29:42,502 --> 01:29:45,255
Was a long time ago, children.
It was...

727
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:50,560
It was another time. I, uh... I...

728
01:29:51,845 --> 01:29:53,643
Well, I was another person.

729
01:29:55,765 --> 01:29:58,018
Would you like to meet her again?

730
01:30:01,354 --> 01:30:03,106
We have a film.

731
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:06,993
One of Georges' films?

732
01:30:07,736 --> 01:30:09,659
That's not possible. They're all gone.

733
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:12,578
May we show you?

734
01:30:12,741 --> 01:30:16,371
Please.
- Oh, yes, please, Mama. Please.

735
01:30:22,792 --> 01:30:24,635
Just be quick with it.

736
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:30,433
You were an actress,
a real cinema actress!

737
01:30:30,592 --> 01:30:34,062
- It's impossibly romantic, Mama.
- It wasn't like that.

738
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:37,724
We weren't movie stars
like they have today.

739
01:30:40,352 --> 01:30:42,104
But we did have fun.

740
01:30:47,317 --> 01:30:48,910
Madame Méliès?

741
01:31:40,537 --> 01:31:42,084
It's in color!

742
01:31:42,247 --> 01:31:44,375
But of course.
We tinted the film.

743
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:48,512
We painted it by hand,
frame by frame.

744
01:32:02,017 --> 01:32:03,394
Mama, it's you!

745
01:32:07,981 --> 01:32:08,982
Yes.

746
01:32:36,718 --> 01:32:39,471
Oh, beautiful.

747
01:32:56,738 --> 01:32:58,866
You were beautiful.

748
01:32:59,032 --> 01:33:00,909
She still is.

749
01:33:21,638 --> 01:33:28,362
I would recognize the sound
of a movie projector anywhere.

750
01:33:33,983 --> 01:33:35,656
Georges...

751
01:33:37,362 --> 01:33:40,912
you've tried to forget
the past for so long.

752
01:33:44,035 --> 01:33:48,541
It's brought you nothing
but unhappiness, hmm'?

753
01:33:49,290 --> 01:33:52,169
Maybe it's time to try and remember.

754
01:34:04,973 --> 01:34:06,896
You want to know?

755
01:34:10,103 --> 01:34:11,525
Yes.

756
01:34:15,525 --> 01:34:17,619
Just like you...

757
01:34:19,612 --> 01:34:22,206
I loved to fix things.

758
01:34:25,577 --> 01:34:28,171
I started out <i>as</i> a magician.

759
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:30,957
Mama Jeanne was my assistant.

760
01:34:44,762 --> 01:34:48,392
<i>We were very successful, I must say.
We even had our own theater.</i>

761
01:35:15,752 --> 01:35:18,175
<i>But I was always tinkering
with machines.</i>

762
01:35:18,338 --> 01:35:23,515
<i>I had my own workshop at the theater,
where I could invent new illusions.</i>

763
01:35:24,177 --> 01:35:26,805
<i>Once, I even built a
working automaton.</i>

764
01:35:27,347 --> 01:35:30,476
<i>Oh, he... was a particular treasure.</i>

765
01:35:30,642 --> 01:35:34,897
<i>I put my heart and soul into him</i>

766
01:35:38,942 --> 01:35:42,162
<i>Then, one night,
Mama Jeanne and I</i>

767
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:45,199
<i>went to visit a traveling circus.</i>

768
01:35:45,365 --> 01:35:50,292
<i>We were walking past the sideshow tents
when I noticed something.</i>

769
01:35:50,453 --> 01:35:54,174
<i>Something strange.
Something wonderful.</i>

770
01:35:54,332 --> 01:35:56,130
It will terrify you!

771
01:35:56,292 --> 01:35:59,887
Sir, madame, inside we have
moving pictures! Come and see!

772
01:36:02,173 --> 01:36:06,474
<i>The Lumière brothers
had invented the movies.</i>

773
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:23,700
<i>I fell in love with their invention.
How could I not be part of it?</i>

774
01:36:24,487 --> 01:36:27,787
<i>It was like...
It was like a new kind of magic.</i>

775
01:36:29,242 --> 01:36:33,543
<i>I asked the Lumière brothers
to sell me a camera, but they refused.</i>

776
01:36:33,705 --> 01:36:37,460
<i>You see, they were convinced
that movies were only a passing fad</i>

777
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:41,050
<i>and they saw no future in it,
or so they said.</i>

778
01:36:41,212 --> 01:36:44,056
<i>In the end, I built my own camera</i>

779
01:36:44,215 --> 01:36:47,059
<i>using leftover pieces
from the automaton.</i>

780
01:36:47,218 --> 01:36:50,518
<i>I just had to be a part
of this new wonder.</i>

781
01:36:52,015 --> 01:36:56,361
<i>We risked everything. And we sold
the theater and everything we had</i>

782
01:36:56,519 --> 01:36:59,523
<i>so we could build
our own movie studio.</i>

783
01:36:59,689 --> 01:37:01,066
Excellent.

784
01:37:03,318 --> 01:37:05,241
Cameras, are we clear?

785
01:37:06,195 --> 01:37:08,664
<i>And so the great adventure began.</i>

786
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:11,167
Actors only on the set, please!
Clear the set!

787
01:37:11,326 --> 01:37:14,330
Look at you, look at you!
Love this shape, Mel.

788
01:37:14,495 --> 01:37:17,089
It's a toile, though, right?

789
01:37:17,874 --> 01:37:22,220
<i>I wrote, designed, directed, and acted</i>

790
01:37:22,378 --> 01:37:24,927
<i>in hundreds of movies.</i>

791
01:37:25,089 --> 01:37:26,181
I'm ready.

792
01:37:34,557 --> 01:37:37,982
Oh, that was good,
that was good, yes, yes.

793
01:37:38,144 --> 01:37:40,442
That felt good, that felt good.
On the pulley? On the smoke?

794
01:37:57,914 --> 01:37:59,666
Stop, stop, stop. I saw that.

795
01:37:59,832 --> 01:38:01,880
Give me two minutes.
It was good up to there.

796
01:38:02,043 --> 01:38:04,011
Benny'? I'm gonna have a word.

797
01:38:04,170 --> 01:38:06,969
Reload. Reset the dragon.

798
01:38:07,131 --> 01:38:08,678
Benny, speak to me.

799
01:38:08,841 --> 01:38:10,593
If you pull down a little harder
on the left-hand rope,

800
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:12,762
the head will come up higher,
which will be better...

801
01:38:12,929 --> 01:38:15,102
- Under the belly!
- I see it.

802
01:38:15,264 --> 01:38:17,062
Excellent, excellent, excellent.

803
01:38:17,225 --> 01:38:19,694
The choreography was really good
up to there. Thank you, gentlemen.

804
01:38:19,852 --> 01:38:22,901
- First positions!
- Back, first positions!

805
01:38:24,315 --> 01:38:25,692
Action!

806
01:38:42,375 --> 01:38:44,548
Excellent, excellent.
Setting back.

807
01:38:44,710 --> 01:38:47,338
And in for the kill, knights.
In for the kill!

808
01:38:47,505 --> 01:38:49,849
Come on, then, attack!

809
01:38:50,425 --> 01:38:53,269
Stabbing, stabbing, and lunge!

810
01:38:53,803 --> 01:38:55,521
Good.

811
01:39:00,935 --> 01:39:03,484
Good, good. Good, knights.
Poised for the attack.

812
01:39:04,689 --> 01:39:07,192
And... knights!

813
01:39:07,358 --> 01:39:11,488
Three, two, one, freeze!

814
01:39:11,654 --> 01:39:13,327
Skeletons, that's great.
You can go.

815
01:39:13,489 --> 01:39:15,708
Pyrotechnics in, please.
Knights, please don't move.

816
01:39:15,867 --> 01:39:18,837
Freeze. Freeze, everybody.
Wait for my "action."

817
01:39:20,705 --> 01:39:24,005
Three, two, one, action!

818
01:39:29,464 --> 01:39:33,765
<i>Magic tricks and illusion
became my spaciality.</i>

819
01:39:33,926 --> 01:39:37,146
<i>The world of imagination.</i>

820
01:39:45,646 --> 01:39:50,652
<i>My beautiful wife
was my muse, my star.</i>

821
01:39:50,818 --> 01:39:53,071
<i>And we couldn't have been happier.</i>

822
01:39:53,237 --> 01:39:54,830
Action!

823
01:40:04,957 --> 01:40:07,210
<i>We thought it would never end.</i>

824
01:40:08,461 --> 01:40:09,929
<i>How could it?</i>

825
01:40:14,550 --> 01:40:17,019
<i>But then the war came.</i>

826
01:40:17,762 --> 01:40:21,357
<i>- And youth and hope were at an end.</i>

827
01:40:24,644 --> 01:40:30,447
<i>The world had no time
for magic tricks and movie shows.</i>

828
01:40:30,608 --> 01:40:34,488
<i>The returning soldiers,
having seen so much of reality,</i>

829
01:40:34,654 --> 01:40:36,782
<i>were bored by my films.</i>

830
01:40:36,948 --> 01:40:42,705
<i>Tastes had changed,
but I had not changed with them.</i>

831
01:40:44,205 --> 01:40:46,458
<i>No one wanted my movies any more.</i>

832
01:40:48,584 --> 01:40:51,303
<i>Eventually I...
I couldn't pay the actors...</i>

833
01:40:52,046 --> 01:40:53,969
<i>or keep the business
running, and...</i>

834
01:40:55,132 --> 01:40:58,432
<i>and so my enchanted castle
fell to ruin.</i>

835
01:40:58,594 --> 01:41:00,562
<i>Everything was lost.</i>

836
01:41:01,764 --> 01:41:03,732
<i>One night, in bitter despair, I...</i>

837
01:41:05,810 --> 01:41:08,780
<i>I burned all my old sets
and costumes.</i>

838
01:41:21,784 --> 01:41:24,378
<i>I was forced to sell my movies
to a company</i>

839
01:41:24,537 --> 01:41:27,461
<i>that melted them down
into chemicals.</i>

840
01:41:30,835 --> 01:41:34,214
<i>These chemicals were used
to make shoe heels.</i>

841
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:43,981
<i>With the little money I had from selling
my films, I bought the toy booth...</i>

842
01:41:46,183 --> 01:41:48,026
<i>and there I have remained.</i>

843
01:41:51,647 --> 01:41:54,821
The only thing I couldn't
bring myself to destroy

844
01:41:54,984 --> 01:41:57,658
was my beloved automaton.

845
01:41:58,904 --> 01:42:03,705
So I gave him to a museum,
hoping he would find a home.

846
01:42:03,868 --> 01:42:07,839
But they never put him on display.
And then the museum burned.

847
01:42:09,415 --> 01:42:12,840
It's all gone now.
Everything I ever made.

848
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:18,303
Nothing but ashes
and fading strips of celluloid.

849
01:42:21,594 --> 01:42:24,438
My life has taught me
one lesson, Hugo,

850
01:42:24,597 --> 01:42:27,851
and not the one I thought it would.

851
01:42:28,017 --> 01:42:30,987
Happy endings only happen in the movies.

852
01:42:35,733 --> 01:42:37,952
I'll be right back.

853
01:43:05,471 --> 01:43:09,567
Stop that! No, no!
Don't you frighten Monsieur Frick.

854
01:43:10,434 --> 01:43:12,903
Schatzi, what's he got?
What has he got?

855
01:43:16,107 --> 01:43:20,078
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness me.

856
01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:27,042
Did you see that?

857
01:43:28,869 --> 01:43:32,919
Be brave. My brave soldier.

858
01:43:38,963 --> 01:43:43,594
Oh! Monsieur Frick, I am undone!

859
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:06,999
- Good evening.
- Ah, hello.

860
01:44:07,158 --> 01:44:10,503
There has been
a disquieting development.

861
01:44:10,661 --> 01:44:12,789
- What is it?
- You know Monsieur Claude?

862
01:44:12,955 --> 01:44:15,378
- Mm-hmm.
- He's been found deceased.

863
01:44:17,042 --> 01:44:18,885
- No.
- Monsieur Claude!

864
01:44:19,044 --> 01:44:22,173
Consequently, he will no longer be
employed here winding the clocks.

865
01:44:22,339 --> 01:44:24,888
You've got a little friend. Look!

866
01:44:25,050 --> 01:44:27,223
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

867
01:44:27,386 --> 01:44:30,640
- Monsieur Claude is dead.

868
01:44:31,974 --> 01:44:34,773
What? Why'?

869
01:44:34,935 --> 01:44:36,152
What happened to him?

870
01:44:36,312 --> 01:44:38,781
They found his corpse in the Seine.

871
01:44:38,939 --> 01:44:41,488
It's been down there
for many months, it seems.

872
01:44:41,650 --> 01:44:43,197
Can't say I'm surprised.

873
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,909
He was an inebriant
of the highest order.

874
01:44:46,071 --> 01:44:48,199
- Well, yes, he was a drunk.
- Shoo.

875
01:44:48,365 --> 01:44:51,835
- Oh, I wouldn't say that.
- Yes, he was a drunk!

876
01:44:51,994 --> 01:44:53,291
Scram! Shoo!

877
01:44:53,454 --> 01:44:55,377
He could've drunk
the entire River Seine.

878
01:44:55,539 --> 01:45:00,591
- Please, go away! Go! Shh.

879
01:45:00,753 --> 01:45:02,426
- Hold it!

880
01:45:02,588 --> 01:45:05,888
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Did you think you'd escape me?

881
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:09,179
- Gustave, have a heart!
- Please, help me!

882
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:15,188
Please.
- No.

883
01:45:15,518 --> 01:45:18,647
He's been undermining
this station for too long.

884
01:45:18,813 --> 01:45:20,611
Come on!

885
01:45:20,773 --> 01:45:22,616
- What's the boy done?
- Let me go!

886
01:45:22,775 --> 01:45:24,448
- You happy now, boy?!
- Don't do this!

887
01:45:24,610 --> 01:45:25,907
Do not leave my office.

888
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:28,368
You don't understand,
I've got to go.

889
01:45:28,531 --> 01:45:30,784
You'll go nowhere
until your parents are found.

890
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:32,247
I don't have any!

891
01:45:32,409 --> 01:45:35,162
Then it's straight
to the orphanage with you.

892
01:45:35,788 --> 01:45:39,042
You'll learn a thing or two there.
I certainly did.

893
01:45:39,208 --> 01:45:42,257
How to follow orders.
How to keep to yourself.

894
01:45:42,419 --> 01:45:44,467
How to survive without a family.

895
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:49,557
Because you don't need one.
You don't need a family.

896
01:45:52,054 --> 01:45:54,307
Police headquarters,
7th arrondissement?

897
01:45:54,473 --> 01:45:58,068
Yes, it's me again.
Another orphan.

898
01:45:58,853 --> 01:46:00,947
Has been a busy week.

899
01:46:01,105 --> 01:46:06,612
Oh, trespass, theft, pilfering,
littering, pillorying,

900
01:46:06,777 --> 01:46:09,621
walking about, playing.
It's irrelevant.

901
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:11,578
Please come and pick him up.

902
01:46:12,241 --> 01:46:14,164
Anyway, how are you?

903
01:46:14,326 --> 01:46:16,749
Oh, she came back?

904
01:46:16,912 --> 01:46:20,007
Oh, you think it's yours?
Excellent.

905
01:46:20,875 --> 01:46:23,173
Well, I suppose you'll find out
in seven months.

906
01:46:23,335 --> 01:46:28,216
Pardon me. Oh, in March?
I'll try to come.

907
01:46:28,382 --> 01:46:31,056
I... I tend not to plan
that far ahead.

908
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:33,182
Are you sure?

909
01:46:34,179 --> 01:46:35,931
Well, oh, that's very flattering.

910
01:46:36,098 --> 01:46:38,977
I don't know really whether it's
appropriate for me to be the godfa...

911
01:46:40,227 --> 01:46:41,900
Oh! Sir, hold on!

912
01:46:50,487 --> 01:46:52,330
Maximilian!

913
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:54,916
Move!

914
01:46:57,119 --> 01:47:00,498
Move aside! Get out of the way!

915
01:47:27,066 --> 01:47:29,444
Maximilian, find him!

916
01:47:32,947 --> 01:47:34,870
You can't escape me!

917
01:47:56,303 --> 01:47:59,307
There's nowhere to hide up there, boy!

918
01:48:19,118 --> 01:48:21,371
307, 308, 309...

919
01:49:35,861 --> 01:49:39,411
Maximilian, he's gone
the other way. Come on!

920
01:50:42,302 --> 01:50:43,349
You!

921
01:50:44,138 --> 01:50:45,640
Get out of my way!

922
01:50:48,559 --> 01:50:50,027
Got you!

923
01:50:55,107 --> 01:50:56,984
- Oof!

924
01:51:18,839 --> 01:51:20,182
No! Oh!

925
01:51:22,926 --> 01:51:25,975
There's a boy! Turn it off!
There's a boy on the track!

926
01:51:29,933 --> 01:51:30,934
Get out of the way!

927
01:51:41,236 --> 01:51:44,035
Move back! Move aside!
Move back!

928
01:51:44,198 --> 01:51:46,371
What were you thinking?
Are you injured?

929
01:51:47,159 --> 01:51:49,662
- Come on!

930
01:51:49,828 --> 01:51:51,876
Stand aside. Careful.

931
01:51:54,458 --> 01:51:56,426
We'll let the orphanage
deal with you.

932
01:51:56,585 --> 01:51:58,838
- No, I don't belong there!
- Where do you belong?

933
01:51:59,004 --> 01:52:00,927
A child has to belong to somewhere.

934
01:52:01,089 --> 01:52:03,717
Listen to me, please!
Please, listen to me!

935
01:52:03,884 --> 01:52:06,933
You don't understand.
You have to let me go.

936
01:52:07,471 --> 01:52:13,399
I don't understand
why my father died.

937
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:15,403
Why I'm alone.

938
01:52:17,147 --> 01:52:19,900
This is my only chance...

939
01:52:21,068 --> 01:52:23,070
to work.

940
01:52:24,655 --> 01:52:27,078
You should understand!

941
01:52:32,955 --> 01:52:34,423
I do!

942
01:52:37,501 --> 01:52:39,094
I do.

943
01:52:42,839 --> 01:52:44,216
Monsieur...

944
01:52:47,636 --> 01:52:49,513
this child belongs to me.

945
01:53:10,033 --> 01:53:12,502
I'm sorry. He's broken.

946
01:53:12,661 --> 01:53:15,665
No, he's not.

947
01:53:17,666 --> 01:53:20,340
He worked perfectly.

948
01:53:44,693 --> 01:53:47,617
<i>Honored guests, I am proud</i>

949
01:53:47,946 --> 01:53:50,540
to welcome you to this gala

950
01:53:50,699 --> 01:53:55,250
celebrating the life and work
of Georges Méliès!

951
01:54:01,543 --> 01:54:05,173
For years, most of his films
were thought to be lost.

952
01:54:05,339 --> 01:54:09,094
Indeed, Monsieur Méliès
believed so himself.

953
01:54:09,259 --> 01:54:11,136
But we began a search.

954
01:54:11,303 --> 01:54:14,728
We looked through vaults,
through private collections,

955
01:54:14,890 --> 01:54:18,360
barns and catacombs.

956
01:54:19,061 --> 01:54:22,235
Our work was rewarded
with old negatives,

957
01:54:22,397 --> 01:54:27,324
boxes of prints, and trunks
full of decaying film,

958
01:54:27,486 --> 01:54:29,705
which we were able to save.

959
01:54:29,863 --> 01:54:33,618
We now have over 80 films
by Georges Méliès.

960
01:54:39,539 --> 01:54:42,588
And tonight, their creator,

961
01:54:42,751 --> 01:54:46,506
and the newest member
of the Film Academy faculty,

962
01:54:46,671 --> 01:54:49,515
is here to share them with you.

963
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:07,909
Bravo!

964
01:55:12,406 --> 01:55:13,453
Bravo!

965
01:55:24,709 --> 01:55:26,507
Ladies and gentlemen...

966
01:55:28,213 --> 01:55:29,760
I...

967
01:55:39,266 --> 01:55:42,395
I am standing
before you tonight...

968
01:55:43,895 --> 01:55:47,024
because of one
very brave young man...

969
01:55:49,985 --> 01:55:54,991
who saw a broken machine...

970
01:55:57,451 --> 01:56:01,706
and against all odds, he fixed it.

971
01:56:04,666 --> 01:56:07,795
It was the kindest magic trick...

972
01:56:09,212 --> 01:56:11,431
that ever I've seen.

973
01:56:19,556 --> 01:56:23,902
And now, my friends,

974
01:56:24,060 --> 01:56:30,363
I address you all tonight
as you truly are:

975
01:56:30,525 --> 01:56:34,780
Wizards, mermaids...

976
01:56:36,114 --> 01:56:41,496
travelers, adventurers...
magicians.

977
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:53,431
Come and dream with me.

978
01:58:22,512 --> 01:58:28,394
Yes, you can start with the thaumatrope,
the zoetrope, the praxinoscope.

979
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:31,564
Any study of the history of film
must begin with the...

980
01:58:31,730 --> 01:58:34,108
Poppy'? The cave pictographs at...

981
01:58:34,274 --> 01:58:35,742
- Niaux.
- Niaux.

982
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:38,824
About canine socialization.

983
01:58:38,987 --> 01:58:40,580
Not canine romance?

984
01:58:40,739 --> 01:58:44,585
Oh, Monsieur Frick, do I detect
a pearl in your oyster?

985
01:58:44,743 --> 01:58:47,838
The boy designed it.
It does not squeak at all.

986
01:58:48,538 --> 01:58:50,256
Don't forget to smile, darling.

987
01:58:50,415 --> 01:58:53,043
Well, which one?
I've mastered three of them.

988
01:58:55,003 --> 01:58:59,509
Don't worry. I'm now a fully
functioning man. Aren't I, dear?

989
01:58:59,674 --> 01:59:04,396
Tap the deck. And it's up,
it's up, it's up... It's there!

990
01:59:06,222 --> 01:59:08,645
- Is this your card?
- That is my card.

991
01:59:10,602 --> 01:59:16,280
<i>Once upon a time,
I met a boy named Hugo Cabret.</i>

992
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:20,370
<i>He lived in a train station.</i>

993
01:59:20,528 --> 01:59:26,080
<i>"Why did he live in a train station?"
you might well ask.</i>

994
01:59:26,951 --> 01:59:30,080
<i>That's really what this book
is going to be about.</i>

995
01:59:30,997 --> 01:59:35,503
<i>It's about how
this singular young man</i>

996
01:59:35,669 --> 01:59:40,175
<i>searched so hard to find
a secret message from his father...</i>

997
01:59:41,758 --> 01:59:45,808
<i>and how that message lit his way.</i>

998
01:59:48,098 --> 01:59:50,146
<i>All the way home.</i>

999
01:59:50,146 --> 02:00:50,146
