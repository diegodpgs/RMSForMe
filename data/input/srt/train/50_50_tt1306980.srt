1
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:34,734
So, are you staying over tonight?

2
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,234
I'm not sure.

3
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,737
There are a couple of gallery openings
I want to go to.

4
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,739
I'm, like, so nervous about my show.

5
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,579
I mean, I still have two more paintings
that I have to do.

6
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,329
Everything I've been coming up with
is completely derivative

7
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,502
of everything at the Henry.

8
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,080
- Where's my stuff?
- It's in your drawer.

9
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,716
I have a drawer?

10
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,761
Yeah, I just figured I'd, you know,
put some of your things in.

11
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,178
There wasn't anything in the drawer before.

12
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,347
There was a couple of things
but I moved them into a different one

13
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,470
'cause it made more sense that way.

14
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,223
Honey. We're getting so

15
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,479
domestic.

16
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,073
Good luck with the paintings.

17
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,744
I still have a lot of tooth
paste in my mouth right now.

18
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:28,038
- Have a great day.
- Okay.

19
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,285
- Bye.
- Bye.

20
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:40,964
- Hey.
- Yo!

21
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,925
Sorry I'm late.

22
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,971
- What's that smell? What is that?
- What?

23
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,009
Did you sit in jam or something?

24
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:52,722
- What are you talking about?
- You smell all fruity. Oh!

25
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:56,274
Yeah. I ran out of shampoo.
I had to use Rachael's.

26
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,645
That's great.

27
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,990
You smell like
you fucked the cast of <i>The View.</i>

28
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,738
Are we gonna go?

29
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,366
- Why? You don't want to be late?
- Well, I'm two minutes late already.

30
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,072
- You're already two minutes late.
- I know.

31
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:14,410
But if you really care about that, you should
probably learn to drive. That's what I think.

32
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,539
I deserved that.

33
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,166
You know what's really gonna make us late?

34
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,588
What?

35
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,291
- When I stop for cappuccinos.
- No, no, no, they have coffee there.

36
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,173
- Delicious cappuccinos.
- Dude, seriously.

37
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,384
- Your back still hurts?
- Yeah. I'm going back to the doctor today.

38
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,810
- That's not right, man.
- I know.

39
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,478
Have you been fucking in weird positions?

40
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,977
Of course,
that's where you would go with this.

41
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,648
Sometimes when I fuck in weird positions...

42
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:41,604
I tried froggy style for a while once with
a girl I was dating. Fucked up my back.

43
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,234
I don't even want to ask what that is.

44
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,692
It's kind of a doggy style, but like,
you're kind of way higher up...

45
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,699
Actually, Rachael and...
We haven't...

46
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,119
We haven't done it in
like three weeks, dude.

47
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,620
You haven't had sex in three weeks?

48
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,794
Well, she had a yeast infection, and then
she had her period right afterwards.

49
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,418
- Which has got to be done by now.
- You can't fuck with a yeast infection?

50
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:01,874
You can fuck with a yeast infection
or period.

51
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,879
- No. No, it hurts.
- It does?

52
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,461
- Well, that's what she says.
- I think that's bullshit.

53
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,137
No, but I've heard that before
from other girls.

54
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:11,683
Has she been sucking on your dick?
Been giving you blow jobs?

55
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,682
No, she doesn't like to.

56
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,980
She doesn't?
No fucking shit she doesn't like to.

57
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,308
Who likes putting dicks in their mouth?
You do it 'cause...

58
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,482
That's why they're called blow jobs.

59
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,151
- Don't get hysterical.
- It's a job.

60
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,696
I'm not hysterical. I think it is...

61
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:30,406
You... She stays at your house all the time.
She leaves her fucking shit everywhere.

62
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:34,536
You clean it up, you're a nice person.
The least she could do is fellate you.

63
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,992
You put up with a lot of shit
when you're dating a hot girl.

64
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:40,671
Truthfully, that's why, if you recall,
in high school,

65
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,122
I didn't date any hot girls, ever.

66
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,502
- That's why?
- Yes, that's why.

67
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,675
Well, we're not in high school anymore.

68
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:50,256
The relationship that I have with Rachael
is about more than sex.

69
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,433
- What is it about, Adam?
- It's about each other.

70
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,227
You know, we care about each other,
we talk to each other. It's great.

71
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,351
Wouldn't it be nice if you could do that,
and then bang the hell out of each other

72
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,431
- afterwards?
- Ideally, yes.

73
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:04,065
But it's not a perfect world, okay?
Can you hurry up, please?

74
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,405
Just gotta tie my shoe.

75
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,608
Good morning, Jenny.
Hey. How's it going?

76
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,536
Are you on the phone? I'll be quiet.

77
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,830
That's so gross, man. It's disgusting.
You shouldn't do that.

78
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,035
Hey, Kyle, Adam.

79
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,712
- Hey, Phil.
- Sorry we're late.

80
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:26,166
Look at that, you are late. Don't do that.

81
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,752
I wanted to talk to you
about the volcano piece.

82
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,759
It's coming along really well. I've got
all the research and interviews done.

83
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,556
- Great.
- But the narration

84
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,224
is turning into a bit of a problem.

85
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,428
Whoever did it, he kept clearing his throat.

86
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,855
And he doesn't take a pause, he just keeps
talking. And if there was a pause

87
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,227
I could cut around it. But...

88
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,354
- Cool?
- Grab that.

89
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:44,981
- Okay.
- So I'm just gonna...

90
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,150
It's like he doesn't care.

91
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,529
No, it's like we gotta put shit
on the radio every single day.

92
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,204
And it's pointless to spend months
working on something

93
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,123
that someone's gona hear for two seconds
while they're stopped at a red light.

94
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,871
Well, I like it when it's good radio.

95
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,998
Yeah, well, good luck with that.

96
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,671
You're in Wales? You're in Wales?

97
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,838
So does that make you Welsh, or Wale-ish?

98
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,762
I never know which one's which.

99
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,305
Okay, yeah. World music.

100
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,930
Can you hear me? Your voice sounds weird.
You sound like a robot.

101
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,431
Do I sound like a robot?

102
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,932
Does it sound weird to you?

103
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,389
You have to be quieter. I'm trying to...

104
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,521
I said you sound like a robot to me.

105
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,900
Wait, go back. Go back. It's unbelievable.
I know.

106
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,605
See, I don't know
what world music is either.

107
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,940
That's what's so weird about it.

108
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,070
"It's unbelievable. I know.

109
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:36,995
"I know. What is world music, anyway?
I'm such a fucking asshole.

110
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,494
"I'm the king of the fucking world.
Suck my dick.

111
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:42,417
"My friend Adam hasn't had his dick
sucked in six fucking months."

112
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,779
- How are you?
- Hi.

113
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,377
The patient has been complaining
of back pain and night sweats.

114
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,171
Blood tests and urine analysis are normal.

115
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,170
MRI suggests
a massive intradural malignant

116
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,923
schwannoma neurofibrosarcoma
extending in the psoas muscle

117
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,972
with nerve root compression syndrome
and bone erosion.

118
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:41,597
The growth extends from L2 to L5.
Will send patient for biopsy to confirm.

119
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,222
Yes, question?

120
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:49,525
Sorry, I just didn't follow that.
Is there something wrong with me?

121
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:53,321
Yes. Well, if you look here on your MRI,

122
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:58,323
you see this cephalopod-like object
that's spreading down your spinal column.

123
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:01,075
That is a massive
schwannoma neurofibrosarcoma.

124
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,451
Okay.

125
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,369
- So sorry. I just don't know what that...
- It's a malignant tumor.

126
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,166
- A tumor?
- Yes.

127
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,630
- Me?
- Yes.

128
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:15,427
That doesn't make any sense though.

129
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,550
I mean, I don't smoke. I don't drink.
I... You know. I recycle.

130
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,474
Actually, your case
is really quite fascinating because

131
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,645
your cancer is the result of an incredibly
rare gene mutation in chromosome 17,

132
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,940
the P53 gene that causes
the growth of malignant cells...

133
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,071
I think that given the placement and size
of your particular tumor,

134
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:47,079
the wisest course of action is to see
if we can possibly reduce this thing

135
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,128
down to a more manageable size
before we consider surgery.

136
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:54,591
Now, chemotherapy can often result
in fertility issues.

137
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,963
But I'm gonna be okay?

138
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,511
If you need someone to talk to,

139
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,846
we have an excellent staff here
at the hospital

140
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,769
of social workers and psychologists.

141
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,814
They specialize in these matters,
and they would be able to help you.

142
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,850
Now as I said, you should consider...

143
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,220
<i>Two jumps in a week</i>

144
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:46,677
<i>I bet you think that's pretty clever,</i>
<i>don't you, boy?</i>

145
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,148
<i>Flying on your motorcycle</i>

146
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:56,979
<i>Watching all the ground beneath you drop</i>

147
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:04,114
<i>You'd kill yourself for recognition</i>

148
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:08,323
<i>Kill yourself to never, ever stop</i>

149
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,836
Oh, Adam.

150
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:17,165
Listen, I'm not expecting you
to take this on.

151
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,125
I mean,
it's not like we're married or anything.

152
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:24,305
So, you know, if you have to bail,
then you should. No hard feelings.

153
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:28,726
Not that I want you do.
I hope that you don't.

154
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,304
I'm not gonna bail on you, Adam.

155
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,020
I'm here for you.

156
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,527
Okay?

157
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,197
Thank you.

158
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,652
It's gonna be okay.

159
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,708
Yeah. It'll be okay. All right?

160
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,126
- I'm gonna throw up.
- Don't throw up. You're gonna be fine.

161
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,209
- I actually think I might throw up.
- You're not gonna throw up.

162
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,794
No, open your eyes.
Look at me, look at me.

163
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,550
- Okay.
- All right?

164
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,719
What kind of cancer is it?
What's the name of the cancer?

165
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,722
- Some rare kind of cancer.
- What's it called?

166
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,804
Schwannoma... I knew this.

167
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,515
- Schwannoma? It's schwannoma?
- Schwannoma...

168
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,601
- What's schwannoma?
- That means tumor, basically.

169
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,231
Do you have a picture of it, at least?
Can I see it?

170
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,402
Why would I have a picture of it?

171
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,698
It's common practice
to fucking get pictures of shit now.

172
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:26,071
But that's like the Internet, so...

173
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,120
- It's not a picture of anything.
- Are you gonna be okay?

174
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,242
- I think so.
- What are your chances?

175
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,869
- What are your odds?
- I don't know.

176
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,575
I looked it up and it said 50/50.

177
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,252
But that's like the Internet, so...

178
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,463
That's not that bad.

179
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,254
That's better than I thought.
You're gonna be fine, man.

180
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,381
You're young.
Young people beat cancer all the time.

181
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,962
Every celebrity beats cancer.

182
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,673
Fucking Lance Armstrong,
he keeps getting it.

183
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,258
- Yeah.
- He's fine.

184
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,685
- Yeah.
- The guy from <i>Dexter?</i> He's okay.

185
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,763
Patrick Swayze? He's fine.

186
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,314
- Patrick Swayze?
- And he's older.

187
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,518
Yeah, but, dude, that guy's dead.

188
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,525
- Really?
- Yeah.

189
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,696
That's really fucked up. I didn't know that.

190
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,873
Don't even think about him, okay?
Don't worry about that.

191
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,576
- You got to look at the bright side here.
- Bright side? Of what?

192
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,501
You're gonna be fine.
What did your parents say?

193
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,711
Did they freak out? Your mother?

194
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,918
I'm not gonna tell her.

195
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,423
You're not gonna tell her?
You gotta tell her.

196
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,379
She'll probably deal with it better
than most people.

197
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,714
Your dad has Alzheimer's, you know.

198
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,424
- She's used to dealing with tragedy.
- But you know her.

199
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,134
- She loses her fucking...
- Obviously you have to tell her.

200
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,890
I'm gonna tell her.

201
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,519
- You're gonna be fine.
- Yeah.

202
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,645
You're gonna be fine. 50/50!

203
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,695
If you were a casino game,
you would have the best odds.

204
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,567
Yeah, thanks.

205
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,774
- Okay. Let's get to work.
- You don't want coffee?

206
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:49,359
I'm awake now.

207
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,788
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

208
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,165
Hi, Dad.

209
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,540
- Hi, I'm Richard.
- Adam.

210
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,042
This is Adam, your son. Remember?

211
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:04,583
Adam.

212
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,004
Hi!

213
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,345
So, what's the big news?
Is Rachael pregnant?

214
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,514
Mom, no. I'll tell you, okay?

215
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,263
Okay, okay. I know you use protection.

216
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,436
- Wow, you need to do something about this.
- What?

217
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,936
- Well, call the landlord, the paint's peeling.
- It's fine.

218
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,985
- Give me his number, I'll call him.
- Okay.

219
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,062
- Hi.
- Hi.

220
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,532
- That's new.
- Yeah. Rachael made it.

221
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,951
- It's called <i>Oppression.</i>
- No, it's <i>Liberation.</i>

222
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,450
That's right, that one's <i>Liberation.</i>

223
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,405
<i>Oppression</i> is in the bathroom.

224
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,288
- Nice.
- Thank you.

225
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,455
Sweetheart, your pills.

226
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,129
There you go.

227
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:54,637
So, what's the special occasion?

228
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:59,304
I want to tell you something, but...

229
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,109
I just need you to promise me
you're gonna stay calm.

230
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,061
Adam, don't be so overdramatic.

231
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:10,523
- Mom, just promise, okay?
- Okay, I promise.

232
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,485
You always make me out to be
some irrational loon.

233
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,945
Okay.

234
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,249
- Have you ever seen <i>Terms of Endearment?</i>
- Mmm-hmm.

235
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,002
Jesus, Adam. Just tell her.

236
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,549
Tell me what?

237
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,296
I have cancer.

238
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,259
What do you mean you have cancer?

239
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:42,393
I have cancer.
What do you want me to say?

240
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,772
When did this happen?

241
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,941
A couple of days ago.

242
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,863
A couple of days ago?

243
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,155
You waited a couple of days to tell me?

244
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,495
I'm sorry. You're right.

245
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,658
Honey.

246
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,298
- I'm moving in.
- What? No. No, Mom. No.

247
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,127
- I'm your mother, Adam.
- No! Exactly. That's why.

248
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,462
And look, you already have enough
on your plate with him.

249
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,343
Who's gonna take you
to your appointments?

250
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,346
You don't even drive a car.
Who's gonna look after you?

251
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,226
Me.

252
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,609
I'm going to take care of him.

253
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,944
Mom. Mom! Mom!

254
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,331
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna make you some green tea.

255
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,626
Can you just come back? Come sit down.

256
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:50,628
I heard on the <i>Today</i> show that
it reduces your risk of cancer by 15%.

257
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,386
Well, I already have cancer.

258
00:16:55,473 --> 00:17:01,389
So, can you just please come
and sit down. Okay?

259
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:14,947
- Hi, I'm looking for Dr. McKay.
- Second door down there.

260
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:33,624
Come in!

261
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,137
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

262
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,886
I'm supposed to have an appointment
with Dr. McKay?

263
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:42,887
Oh!

264
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,344
Sorry.

265
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:49,558
Please come in
and please call me Katherine. Hi.

266
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,064
- You're Dr. McKay.
- I am. Uh...

267
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,104
Well, have a seat. Sit down, please.

268
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,736
Sorry about this guy.

269
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,122
- You're Adam.
- Yeah.

270
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:08,872
And aren't you supposed to be wearing
an earth-toned sweater

271
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:11,454
and be like 65 or something?

272
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:12,755
Did someone say I looked like that?

273
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:18,257
No, no, no. I'm just... Sorry.
If you don't mind, how old are you?

274
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,301
- Twenty-four.
- You're 24. Wow!

275
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,758
So, what, are you like Doogie Howser
or something?

276
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,176
Who?

277
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,847
Doogie Howser? Teenage doctor.

278
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,728
- Does he work here?
- No, no.

279
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,686
I just meant you seem a little young
to be a doctor.

280
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,194
Technically I'm not a doctor yet.
I'm actually working on my doctorate.

281
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:42,448
- Okay.
- Yeah, this is a training hospital.

282
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:46,781
I see. So have you had very many patients?

283
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,701
My patient history is not...

284
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,333
- I'm your first patient, aren't I?
- No.

285
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,963
- No?
- No, not at all.

286
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,632
- Second?
- No.

287
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,879
Third?

288
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:04,469
Wow, okay, third.
How are the first two doing?

289
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,644
- Can't talk about that.
- Right.

290
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,848
So this is training for you?

291
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,603
It will be part of my dissertation.

292
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,643
Oh, so you write about all of this?

293
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,820
Don't worry, I don't use your real name.

294
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,906
Okay. That's fine.

295
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,194
Well, Dr. Ross

296
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:30,249
filled me in on your situation.

297
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,416
Yeah.

298
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:35,959
This must be incredibly difficult
that all this...

299
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:40,339
- How do you feel right now?
- Fine. Yeah, I feel...

300
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:45,180
I can't remember being so calm
in a long time.

301
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,600
That's a really common symptom
in patients like yourself.

302
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:53,057
Actually your body is in survival mode,
so what you're experiencing is shock.

303
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,017
What? I think I'm actually just fine.

304
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:59,445
Right, but that's why you're feeling
the sense of calm.

305
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:03,024
Would you describe what you're feeling
as a kind of numbness?

306
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,199
No, I'd describe it as fine.

307
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,119
- Because certain patients feel like...
- I feel great.

308
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:12,867
Well, that's wonderful.

309
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,039
- I think that's wonderful.
- Thanks.

310
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:19,837
If it's okay with you, I think maybe today

311
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,545
we'll just start with some
simple relaxation exercises.

312
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,051
- I am relaxed.
- I know you are.

313
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,131
Um...

314
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:32,095
But just humor me?

315
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,895
If you want to lie down.

316
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,644
- Lie down?
- Yeah.

317
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:49,862
Okay.

318
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:55,376
And close your eyes.

319
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,623
Really?

320
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,125
Yeah.

321
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,128
For this to work,
you're gonna have to trust me.

322
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,631
Yeah. They're closed.

323
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,841
Okay.

324
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,433
<i>No peeking,</i>
<i>keep your eyes closed.</i>

325
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:19,271
Okay, open your eyes.

326
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,612
Surprise!

327
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:28,242
His name is Skeletor.
He's a retired race dog.

328
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,035
You got me an old dog?

329
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,329
Well, he's not that old.

330
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,702
He's old enough to be retired.

331
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,827
Having a dog helps
with the healing process.

332
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,787
What, does he have a medical license?

333
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:43,666
Okay, forget it. I can just bring
him back to the shelter in the morning.

334
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,376
Well, then what happens to him?

335
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:48,508
He will be put back in his tiny cage
with 10 other dogs

336
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:51,716
who will bully and rape him
until he's eventually euthanized.

337
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,729
Okay, fine, I'll keep the dog.

338
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,728
- Really?
- Yeah.

339
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,944
This is gonna be so good for you.
I promise.

340
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,159
This whole party was my idea.

341
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:14,535
I thought maybe we could just,
you know, celebrate his life.

342
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:19,502
I mean, he's gonna be better. Right?
It's not like he...

343
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:25,003
I hope so. But, you know, I just...
I'm not even thinking about that.

344
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:29,804
Tonight I thought it was best not to think
about whether he gets better or doesn't.

345
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,098
I just thought we should celebrate
the Adam that we all know and love.

346
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,683
Have you started chemo yet?

347
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:37,015
So, what kind of cancer you got?

348
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,062
You want to know the secret
to beating this thing?

349
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,764
My uncle had what you have.

350
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:56,789
I like to get touched when I cry.
I don't know about you.

351
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,199
I'm gonna miss you so much.

352
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,627
I'm gonna miss you too, Phil.

353
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,873
Hey, Phil.

354
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,299
Yeah, buddy?

355
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:12,050
You know, I want you to know I'm still
gonna finish that Mount Moa Moa story.

356
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:15,008
You take as much time as you need.
I can't wait to hear that.

357
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,137
Thanks.

358
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,066
You know, I just wanted to say that

359
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:26,978
you've been really great
these last couple of weeks.

360
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:31,611
And then today making me breakfast
and coming with me. It's just really great.

361
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:34,614
- Thanks for saying that.
- Thank you.

362
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,492
Oh, Adam.

363
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:45,538
- Are you coming?
- If it's cool, could I just wait here?

364
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:49,508
- Well, you know it's like four hours, right?
- Yeah, yeah, no, I know.

365
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,298
So you're just gonna sit here
for four hours?

366
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:58,392
Honey, I don't want to mix that world

367
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,178
and, you know, this world.

368
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:05,687
It's like an energy thing. You know?

369
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,695
Okay. All right.

370
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,037
Good luck.

371
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,213
- Adam Lerner?
- Yep.

372
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:42,678
<i>Oh, I'm all alone</i>

373
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,515
This way, my baby.

374
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,615
<i>I know you're still listening to me</i>

375
00:24:56,245 --> 00:25:00,830
<i>Isn't a lot as far as I see</i>

376
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,583
You want a macaroon?

377
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,297
Oh, thanks. I'm all right.

378
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,431
There's weed in them.

379
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:21,883
Oh.

380
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:28,475
Yeah, thank you. But I don't do weed.

381
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,727
Come on, man, just get high with us.

382
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,188
Okay.

383
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,273
- Thanks.
- Sure.

384
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,651
Hey.

385
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:42,155
- How old are you?
- I'm 27.

386
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:45,912
That's the worst.
What a waste of a perfectly good youth.

387
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,709
Don't listen to him.
He's just messing with you.

388
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:51,914
No, no, you listen to me.
You know, this cancer is bullshit.

389
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:54,716
See, first, all your hair falls out.

390
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,543
Then your balls are gonna shrink.

391
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,469
And then to make matters worse,

392
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,882
your dick becomes a constant source
of disappointment.

393
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:05,060
You know, I was kind of scared
about this whole cancer thing.

394
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:08,105
But now I've met you guys
and, boy, do I feel better.

395
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:09,477
Thank you.

396
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:17,940
I'm Alan Lombardo, stage three lymphoma.
Pleased to meet you.

397
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:20,742
Mitch Barnett, metastatic prostate cancer.

398
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,535
Nice to meet you.

399
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:28,159
Oh, I'm Adam Lerner,
schwannoma neurofibrosarcoma.

400
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,418
Whoo! What the fuck is that?

401
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:32,584
Tough break.

402
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,962
The more syllables, the worse it is.

403
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:41,593
- These are really good.
- Yeah, my wife made them.

404
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:43,673
Are they, uh...

405
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,472
How strong are they?

406
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,766
Stee-rong.

407
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,487
<i>There's a light</i>

408
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,242
<i>A certain kind of light</i>

409
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,784
<i>That never shone on me</i>

410
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:17,667
<i>I want my life to be lived with you</i>

411
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,460
<i>Lived with you</i>

412
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:26,718
<i>There's a way</i>
<i>Everybody say</i>

413
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,267
<i>To do each and every little thing</i>

414
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:36,018
<i>But what does it bring</i>

415
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,399
<i>If I ain't got you?</i>

416
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,572
<i>Ain't got</i>

417
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:45,828
<i>Baby, you don't know what it's like</i>

418
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:50,115
<i>Baby, you don't know what it's like</i>

419
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,410
<i>To love somebody</i>

420
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:56,129
<i>To love somebody</i>

421
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,166
<i>The way I love you</i>

422
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:03,296
<i>Oh, no, no</i>

423
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,052
<i>You don't know what it's like</i>

424
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:09,973
<i>Baby, you don't know...</i>

425
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,625
Adam, are you okay?

426
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,464
So, how are you feeling,
after your first chemo?

427
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:50,267
It feels pretty bad, I gotta say.

428
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,016
My head hurts right now.

429
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,605
Yeah.

430
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:59,105
From what I understand, it's really rough.

431
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,356
Um... But it will pass.

432
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:06,816
Mmm.

433
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,997
I think it's important to remember that
these side effects are completely normal.

434
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,284
Well, that's good. I would hate to feel
special in some kind of way.

435
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,585
I'm sensing some anger, which is good.

436
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,163
I'm not angry.

437
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,001
Why would that be good?

438
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,587
Because you're expressing yourself.

439
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:30,516
You're dealing with a really serious illness

440
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,643
and it brings up a lot of emotions.

441
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:38,144
So you're trying to make me freak out
or something, right? Is that the goal here?

442
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,526
I'm not trying to make you freak out.

443
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:44,939
I do want you to get in touch with
what you're feeling inside.

444
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:48,025
- So, if you're angry...
- I'm not angry! Okay?

445
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,236
Let's just do the relaxation things, okay?

446
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,868
Can we do that? I want to hear sitars,

447
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,242
and go to my happy place
and feel the warm beam of light.

448
00:29:57,421 --> 00:30:00,037
- Can we do that?
- I see.

449
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:08,717
I'm sorry. I'm just being an asshole.

450
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,547
I didn't need to say that.

451
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,553
I don't need you to take care of me.

452
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,061
I'm trying to take care of you.

453
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,181
You're right.

454
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:25,150
Listen, there are a couple of books
I want you to check out.

455
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,027
A lot of people find them really helpful.

456
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:32,736
You don't have to read them cover-to-cover.

457
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:36,039
Just take a look
and see if anything resonates.

458
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:37,241
- Okay?
- Okay.

459
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:45,674
Sorry. Are you gonna, like,
keep touching me like that?

460
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,251
- This?
- Yeah.

461
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,085
I'm, uh...

462
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,796
I'm trying to make you feel more at ease.

463
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:56,010
That's gonna make me feel more at ease?
It's like being slapped by a sea otter.

464
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,935
Touching promotes trust.
It's one of the key ways

465
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,765
that hospital practitioners
make their patients

466
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,224
feel more secure in stressful situations.

467
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,561
Yeah, but it's just...
That's not gonna help.

468
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,111
Really? A sea otter?

469
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:10,032
Is this... Is that kind of better?

470
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,860
- Okay, this is getting creepy.
- I'm sorry.

471
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,445
Okay, you don't like that. That's fine.

472
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,034
You shouldn't do this.
You're making a mistake.

473
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,365
You're gonna look weird, man.

474
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,700
- What do you mean?
- It's gonna look fucking weird.

475
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,035
What are you talking about?

476
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:24,713
Who knows if you've got some big
Gorbachev bird shit thing on your head.

477
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,587
- You said that you liked this idea.
- I liked the idea in theory.

478
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,008
Now that we're standing here
about to do it,

479
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:32,008
I think you're gonna look like fucking
Michael Stipe or something.

480
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,589
- We have to do it.
- I'm not doing it, man.

481
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,344
- We have to do it.
- You do it. I'm not fucking doing it.

482
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,515
- Come on. Do it.
- No way.

483
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,718
- You said you would.
- I don't want to,

484
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,178
'cause if it looks fucked up
you're gonna blame me

485
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,228
every time you look
at your weird-looking bald head.

486
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,852
What? Wait a minute.

487
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,478
What do you use this for?

488
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,691
You know, my body hair.

489
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,536
When was the last time you cleaned this?

490
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,243
Like brand new.

491
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,332
- That's great.
- Totally clean.

492
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:05,129
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

493
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:10,630
Oh, fuck. Dude.

494
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,844
Holy shit.

495
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,178
Cut that part off.

496
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,981
- Shit.
- You want to do one?

497
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:28,856
Yeah, can I? Okay, I'm gonna do it.

498
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,741
I don't want to do it anymore.

499
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,410
You kinda got a Klingon thing
going on here.

500
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,034
You could pass for Worf
from <i>Star Trek.</i>

501
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,956
- Looks totally good.
- It's totally uneven.

502
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,078
Totally normal.

503
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,252
Is this attached? Jesus Christ.

504
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,454
Looks okay, right?

505
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,419
No, looks really weird.

506
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,125
- We shouldn't have done this.
- Yeah, big mistake.

507
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,505
Why didn't we go to a barber?

508
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:55,883
That would have been a good idea.
If we paid someone to do it.

509
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,091
Using your fucking balls trimmer
instead of going to the barber.

510
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:03,099
I never wash them, ever.
And it's not my balls, it's my asshole.

511
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,896
- I'm joking.
- You're not joking.

512
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,644
Not at all.

513
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,738
- How come we've never met Rachael?
- Yeah, what the fuck?

514
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:20,863
Yeah, hospitals kind of freak her out, so...

515
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,164
Hmm.

516
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,491
What?

517
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,952
Well, Adam,
nobody likes going to the hospital.

518
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:29,288
That's not why people go.

519
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:34,877
No, no, you don't get it. it's like she doesn't
want to mix the negative and the positive.

520
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,836
It's an energy thing.

521
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,431
Sounds to me like a bullshit thing.

522
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:43,894
Well, you can meet her if you want.
She's gonna pick me up right after this.

523
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,596
If you want to meet her.
I'm sure she would love to meet you guys.

524
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,771
Sure.

525
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:51,644
She's really great.
You guys are gonna like her a lot.

526
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:52,818
Okay.

527
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:58,696
Hey, it's me again.
Just calling to check if you're close.

528
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:02,028
I'll talk to you soon. Okay. See you.

529
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,240
So you need a ride, kid?

530
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:08,919
Oh, no, she's gonna come.
I'm sure she is just hung up or something.

531
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:12,998
You guys should probably go, though.
You could meet her next time.

532
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,127
Yeah, sure.

533
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,629
- See you, Adam.
- See you.

534
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:52,667
Adam, I know. I'm sorry.
Please don't be mad.

535
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,798
I was calling you for like an hour.

536
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:58,001
Yeah, my cell phone died.

537
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,136
You know, you don't have to do this.

538
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,842
I'm sorry, I am. I know I fucked up.

539
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,472
I gave you an out.

540
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:10,143
I'm doing my best.

541
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,223
Can we just go home?

542
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,533

00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,204
Mystic psychiatrist?

546
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:38,383
What is that? Is he Frodo's psychiatrist?
Why would you buy that?

547
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,303
Because the therapist lady said to buy it.

548
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,755
So, I don't know,
what else am I gonna do?

- Let's go to Mardi Gras.
- I have a girlfriend.

Why would I go to Mardi Gras?

551
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:53,811
You have a girlfriend. Yeah, I forgot.
Why would you go to Mardi Gras

when you're busy here
not getting blow jobs and hand jobs?

You know what? If you're not
gonna take advantage of this then I am.

- Hi, Claire. Hi. I'm Kyle.
- Hi.

Could you help me find
some of these, please?

556
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,335
Yeah. Sure.

557
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,843
Are these for you? I'm sorry,

558
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:27,425
- that's really none of my business.
- No. Don't worry. No, thank God.

559
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,472
They're actually for my friend.
That guy over there.

560
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,019
- That little guy in the hat.
- Yeah.

561
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:34,940
They're for him. He's my buddy.
He's really, really sick.

562
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:36,854
That's awful.

563
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:39,687
He's got type four back cancer, and...

564
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:41,396
- Oh, no. Really?
- I know, yeah.

565
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:42,571
- It's really sad.
- Poor guy.

566
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:46,652
I don't focus on that. I focus on the
positive. I take him out to bookstores.

567
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,954
I like to take him for walks.
I take him out to get snacks and

568
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:53,204
to plays, stuff like
that, while he has time.

569
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,625
That's nice of you.

570
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:58,667
- Yeah. So where are...
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

571
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,670
- They're just over this way.
- No problem. Yeah.

572
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:02,750
- All right, there you are.
- Thank you.

573
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:04,552
- Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

Bye, Claire. Nice to meet you, Claire.
Thank you, Claire.

- <i>Jesus, what took you so long to pick up?</i>

577
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:38,499
- <i>Are you okay?</i>
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

578
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:42,424
I just didn't hear the phone ring.

<i>I'll make you some dinner.</i>

<i>I'll pick up some macaroni and cheese.</i>

582
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,139
I haven't liked macaroni and cheese
since I was like ten.

583
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:58,564
- <i>You haven't?</i>
- Actually Rachael's coming over later.

584
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:02,018
So, I'm totally fine. Don't worry so much.

585
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,276
<i>Fine, if you say so. I love you.</i>

586
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,651

Oh, this one's really cool.

589
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,581
- Look at that.
- My friend did this actually.

590
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:24,665
- No way.
- Yeah.

591
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:27,753
- Your friend's a real talent.
- I know.

592
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,087
Uh-oh.

593
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:31,264
I think I got a new favorite.

That's so amazing.

595
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:37,137
It's like a circle,
but then they add a line in the middle.

596
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:39,894
And that totally sets it off.
It's like totally different.

597
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,724
- Yeah. Simple.
- Holy shit, there's two of them.

598
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,235
What the fuck?

599
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,276
So what do you think about this one?

600
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:48,731
Oh.

601
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,489
This is genius.

602
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:57,324
I mean, I'm having like
an emotional thing going on.

603
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,374
It's fucking gorgeous.

604
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:01,707
It's... You know, it's beautiful.

605
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:05,582
Oh, my God, I should've known
I would see her here.

606
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:08,835
- It's a fucking gallery opening, right?
- Who is she?

607
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,262
You know my friend,
the one who's sick with cancer?

608
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,098
That's his girlfriend.

609
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,846
I'm gonna go get some wine.

610
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,928
She doesn't really look like
she's anyone's girlfriend.

611
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:22,933
No fucking way. No fucking way.

612
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,439
Oh!

613
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,693
I fucking nailed that cunt.
Can you believe that?

614
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,023
Oh, God.

615
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,443
I don't usually say that.

616
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:49,171
Hi.

617
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:52,595
I'm sorry.

618
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,390
I didn't want to wake you.

619
00:39:58,605 --> 00:39:59,936
Come here.

620
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:04,979
I'm just... I'm so tired.
Let's just go to bed, okay?

621
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:07,064
Yeah.

622
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:12,403
- Hey.
- Oh, my God!

623
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,484
Surprise, it's Kyle.

624
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,319
- What's happening, guys?
- Hi, Kyle.

625
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,494
What time is it?

626
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,618
Did I come at a bad time?
Am I interrupting something?

627
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,992
We were just about to go to bed.

628
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:26,083
I'm sorry. I was in the neighborhood.
I was just on a date.

629
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:28,085
Claire, the girl I met at the bookstore?

630
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:31,259
My date did not go well, unfortunately,

631
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:35,510
due to a lack of chemistry and, I think,
an overuse of profanity on my part.

632
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,012
But whilst on my date,

633
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,393
- I ran into Rachael.
- Oh, yeah?

634
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:45,770
And I would like to present to you
what I have grown to call

635
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:49,019
exhibit whore!

636
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,899
Look at it! That's Rachael.

637
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,153
And that's a fucking filthy
Jesus-looking motherfucker!

638
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:58,156
And they're kissing! I did it!
I fucking nailed you!

639
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,953
I've hated you for months!

640
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:03,954
And now I have fucking evidence
that you suck as a person!

641
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:06,832
Holy shit! Holy shit!

642
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,127
Nothing? Nothing?

643
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,513
Okay. You guys should talk about this.

644
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,890
What? Were you cheating on me?

645
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,344
Listen...

646
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,315
- Yes.
- Seriously?

647
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:29,609
Adam...

648
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,364
You have no idea how hard it's been.

649
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,612
I don't know how to do this.

650
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:43,327
This has been so stressful,
and you've been so sick.

651
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,785
And shit! Okay, you know what?
Kyle is the one

652
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:49,086
who has been using your cancer for girls.
All right?

653
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:52,711
You told me that. All right?
So why am I the bad guy?

654
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:54,508
Because you're his girlfriend,
you cheated on him.

655
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,756
He has fucking cancer, you lunatic!

656
00:41:56,848 --> 00:42:00,466
Okay, Adam, we had problems
long before you got sick.

657
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:05,099
And then when you got sick,
I just didn't know what to do.

658
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:11,477
Well, then...

659
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:17,862
Why are you here then?
Why do you spend every night in my bed?

660
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:20,910
I didn't want to abandon you.

661
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,907
Let's just go to bed.

662
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,539
And we will talk about this tomorrow.
All right? I'm sorry.

663
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,838
I can't stand in the kitchen
and listen to this bullshit any longer.

664
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,132
You gotta get out of here.
This is crazy!

665
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:37,256
- You're so weird.
- Adam...

666
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,553
This is the most uncomfortable
situation ever!

667
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,629
- Just leave!
- Yeah.

668
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,807
- And then we're gonna talk tomorrow.
- Get up!

669
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,850
No, you won't!
Why will you talk tomorrow?

670
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,223
- I care about you, Adam. All right?
- This is disgusting.

671
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:49,522
- It's not like this.
- You are reprehensible.

672
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:51,019
- That's what this behavior is.
- Shut up for a second.

673
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:53,438
Kyle does not have your best interests
in mind.

674
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,895
All right?
I've thought that for a very long time.

675
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,901
- I didn't fuck a filthy bearded hippy.
- I want you to know that.

676
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,108
- I didn't make out with a disgusting hippy.
- I care about you.

677
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:02,034
- Fuck you!
- You're disgusting.

678
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,704
This is the best thing
that has ever happened to you.

679
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,630
- Why?
- Why?

680
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:59,208
You deserve better. Way better.

681
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,294
If I was your girlfriend,
you know what I would be doing?

682
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:03,050
I'd be sucking your cock every
thirty minutes.

683
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,177
I'd be baking you fucking cookies all day
and shit.

684
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:07,054
- What kind of cookies?
- Any kind.

685
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,347
You'd make me snickerdoodle cookies?

686
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,929
I'd bathe you in snickerdoodle cookies.

687
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:14,015
- I'm getting nauseous.
- Actually?

688
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,566
No, that was a joke.

689
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,189
- Hi.
- Oh! Look at this guy.

690
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,489
I love greyhounds. Hi. What's his name?

691
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:23,112
Skeletor.

692
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:26,694
- This is Marlow.
- Marlow! Hello, Marlow! Look at this guy.

693
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:29,830
- Do you guys live around here?
- Yeah, we sure do.

694
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,407
He's licking his balls.

695
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,912
- That was awesome.
- That was wonderful.

696
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,417
Yeah, we should probably go.
He gets cold

697
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:38,665
- when he's not moving.
- Yeah, okay.

698
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,169
- Right.
- Nice to meet you.

699
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,217
Okay. Okay. Nice to meet you.

700
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:45,047
- Bye. Nice to meet you.
- Come on.

701
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:47,006
You could've fucked the shit
out of that girl. You know that?

702
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,511
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?

703
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:51,766
No one wants to fuck me.
I look like Voldemort.

704
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:55,105
No, you don't.

705
00:44:56,694 --> 00:45:01,028
It doesn't matter, man. Seriously.
You just invite her out on a doggy date,

706
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:03,489
tell her you have cancer,
and fuck the shit out of her.

707
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:06,192
You really think that a girl's gonna
go for me just 'cause I have cancer?

708
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:09,529
For the millionth time, yes!
You're fucking single now.

709
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:12,411
Dude, help me help you get laid.

710
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,958
- You think that would work?
- It would totally work.

711
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:18,833
All right, let's do it.

712
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:22,088
Lots of hot girls!
Good odds tonight. Lots!

713
00:45:22,178 --> 00:45:23,668
- Okay, right there.
- Yep. All right.

714
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:27,676
Blue shirt. Go for it.
Just talk, spark up a conversation.

715
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:29,803
Hey, how's it going?

716
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,813
Okay, you know what I would do?

717
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,979
Get into the cancer thing faster.

718
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,480
- Faster?
- Faster.

719
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:41,902
- She didn't say anything.
- I know,

720
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,071
but it's your hook, man. It's what you got.
You know?

721
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:47,241
So, what, that's the first thing I say?
Just like, "Hello, I have cancer."

722
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:49,114
That's what makes you different.
It's what sets you apart.

723
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:51,366
- You know, you're sympathetic.
- Okay. Okay.

724
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,697
- Just try it.
- Okay.

725
00:45:58,214 --> 00:45:59,954
- It's a great song.
- Totally.

726
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:01,539
I have cancer.

727
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,500
I was wrong. I was wrong. It was weird.

728
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,381
- It's weird like that.
- That's too soon.

729
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:07,552
- It doesn't sound cool.
- No.

730
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,255
I'm Kyle. How's it going?

731
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,306
- Allison. This is Jackie.
- Allison? Jackie.

732
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:12,850
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you guys.

733
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:15,223
- It's my birthday today!
- Happy birthday!

734
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:18,514
Cheers!

735
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:22,110
- I'm here with my buddy, actually.
- The skinny one?

736
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,357
- One second.
- Yeah.

737
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,115
Look, I met two nice girls.
They're right there.

738
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:29,487
- Yeah, they're cute.
- Yeah, let's go over.

739
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:30,658
- Are they nice?
- They're very nice.

740
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,282
- They're talking to you?
- Yeah.

741
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:33,613
- Really?
- Take the hat off.

742
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:35,699
- Take it off. Take it off.
- I'm not taking it off.

743
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:37,620
What do you guys do?

744
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:39,748
I just designed the website for the Swiffer.

745
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,454
- The Swiffer? Really?
- Yeah.

746
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:45,588
Sorry, I got excited. I'm a fan. I
kike Swiffer. I use it for everything.

747
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:47,885
Mopping and sweeping.

748
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,968
I just got a dog and he sheds a lot.

749
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:56,519
And when there's hair all over the place
I just use a wet cloth. Taken care of.

750
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,187
That's cool. What's your dog's name?

751
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:02,642
His name is Skeletor. Cool guy.

752
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:10,650
- It's kind of...
- Warm in here, isn't it?

753
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:14,078
- Oh, you're so bald.
- No, no. It's just cancer.

754
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,530
- I'm sorry, what?
- Cancer.

755
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,788
Yeah, I have cancer. It's not contagious.

756
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:22,916
Oh, my God.
Well, what Kind of cancer is it?

757
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:26,169
It's spinal.

758
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,295
It's in his spine.

759
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:30,549
I didn't even know that was possible.
How did you get it?

760
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,181
Bad mattress.

761
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:37,138
- He's joking. It was a joke.
- Oh!

762
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,264
- He's just kidding.
- Oh, my God.

763
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:41,974
See. He still has a sense of humor about it.
He's inspirational.

764
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:44,480
- It's an inspiration.
- Very cute.

765
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:48,437
Can I... May we touch it?

766
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,864
Is that weird?

767
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:54,694
- Yeah, if you want to.
- You can do more than touch it. Come on.

768
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:57,872
Oh... Oh, this is a really nice head.

769
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,370
Play with it a little.
Let's all rub it together.

770
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:02,417
It will grow if you rub it enough.

771
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:03,915
There you go.

772
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:07,381
What are you doing? Are you okay?

773
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:09,049
I've got to go to sleep.

774
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:13,049
No, man. You can't.
We have to be awake when they're awake.

775
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,471
That's how we have sex.

776
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,300
That's the whole purpose of this.
Don't throw all this away.

777
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:19,056
Don't waste my time, man.

778
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:24,641
Okay. Can you give me an approximate time
when I'll be having sex?

779
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,236
Ninety-five minutes from now,
we'll be having sex.

780
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,735
- I'm not gonna make it.
- That's how fucking long it's gonna take.

781
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:33,908
I wish it was sooner.
These girls, 96 minutes.

782
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,656
Hey, what's happening? Look at that.

783
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,988
- Got a wiener.
- You got one!

784
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:41,369
So, you guys want to hit up Lash?
I know the DJ.

785
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,543
- Oh, nice.
- I'm gonna have to crash out.

786
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:49,624
Sorry, I'm just exhausted.
The chemo just takes it out of you.

787
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:58,925
But, you know, I have some really potent
medical weed at my house

788
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:01,010
if you want to come over?

789
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:03,642
- That sounds fun.
- That does sound fun!

790
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:06,098
That's a great idea. I love that.

791
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:09,105
- Game on!
- Yeah, let's do it. Nice!

792
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,858
Let's do it. Let's get a cab.
There's cabs over here.

793
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:17,151
Sensational. That's pimping.

794
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:20,079
That was actually very pimp.
That was impressive.

795
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:30,039
I'm sorry, am I hurting you?

796
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:32,045
- No, no, keep going.
- Okay.

797
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:37,384
Are you sure? 'Cause you just don't really
look like you're having a good time.

798
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:44,179
Mmm. No, but it does...
It hurts. I'm sorry. Yeah, my back is...

799
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:47,356
- Yeah, maybe you should just...
- I'll get off you.

800
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:48,899
Maybe...

801
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:53,900
- Yeah, if you don't...
- Sorry.

802
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:09,420
I wonder what the machine gun
budget on this film was.

803
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:13,541
You can't afford actors,
but you need one million machine guns.

804
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:17,337
- Can we watch something else?
- No, I want to see how this ends.

805
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:50,494
I fucked her.

806
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,408
Adam?

807
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:25,989
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

808
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,240
What are you doing?

809
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,701
Good old chemotherapy.

810
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:33,834
Oh. Waiting for the bus.

811
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:41,091
I'm on my way home right now.
I have my car if you want a ride.

812
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,671
I'm used to the bus.

813
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:43,846
- Thank you.
- No, I can't just let you...

814
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,676
I can't make you wait for the bus.

815
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,806
I live kind of far away.

816
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:51,138
I won't take no for an answer.

817
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:03,029
Sorry about the mess.
I'm not good at getting rid of stuff.

818
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,530
Yeah, I see.

819
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:09,578
Let me know if you need to pull over,
or anything.

820
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,078
Like if the chemo's...

821
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:14,037
If you feel nauseous, just say the word
and I'll pull right over.

822
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,712
Okay, thanks.

823
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:19,800
So you don't have a car.

824
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,969
No, I don't even have a license actually.

825
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:23,262
Why not?

826
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:27,092
It's incredibly dangerous.
It's like the fifth leading cause of death.

827
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:32,513
Which is, I guess, just a few behind cancer.

828
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,983
Still, the bus?

829
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:38,818
The bus after chemo?

830
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:41,989
Yeah. Well, usually Rachael drives me.

831
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:46,569
But we broke up.

832
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,575
She kind of cheated on me.

833
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:55,081
Oh, um...

834
00:52:56,048 --> 00:52:58,209
Adam, do you want to talk about this?

835
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:02,760
You know what? Actually, no.
Let's not do the therapy in the car.

836
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,588
- You're just giving me a ride as a friend.
- Yeah, Adam, if...

837
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:08,925
You know, what we should really talk about
is, you have trash on your floor.

838
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,509
And there's no reason.

839
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:13,471
You know, at least have a bag in the back
to put the trash in.

840
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:16,147
Adam, your girlfriend cheated on you.

841
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:19,276
We don't have to talk about it.
We don't have to.

842
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:24,235
I just broke up with somebody
recently myself.

843
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:25,862
- You did?
- Yeah, it sucks.

844
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:29,537
- Sorry.
- No. Well, it's good because...

845
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:38,288
- We actually shouldn't be talking about it.
- Why not?

846
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:40,794
It's not appropriate for me
to tell you personal things

847
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,875
because the patient-therapist relationship
doesn't really work

848
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:45,382
if you know all my problems.

849
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,720
Admittedly I do check his Facebook
like every day

850
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:54,224
to see if he's dating somebody new,
which is so pathetic.

851
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,895
I shouldn't have said that.
I should have stopped.

852
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:57,098
Yeah.

853
00:53:57,985 --> 00:54:00,021
- We could just listen to the radio.
- Yes.

854
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:04,813
<i>And our day is coming by and by</i>

855
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:13,823
<i>I'm traveling this long road to be with you</i>

856
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,408
- Stop the car.
- Are you okay?

857
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:17,834
- Yeah, let's just stop.
- I'm stopping the car.

858
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:25,505
- I just...
- What are you doing?

859
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:27,552
I just can't handle this mess.

860
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:30,464
Are you serious?

861
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,345
Adam.

862
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:40,475
You don't have to. That's my dinner.
The brown thing is my dinner.

863
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:42,935
- Which one?
- That... This thing.

864
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,191
- You're gonna eat that?
- This is new. Don't judge me.

865
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:57,328
Hey, nice. Look at that.

866
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:01,874
Could you unlock the door?

867
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:20,223
- Thanks for the ride.
- No problem.

868
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:23,935
- Thank you for cleaning my car.
- Yeah.

869
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:30,483
- I'll see you next week.
- Okay.

870
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,158
Okay.

871
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:35,488
Uh... Are you gonna be okay by yourself?

872
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:39,784
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll be totally fine.
- Okay.

873
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:42,123
- Bye.
- Bye.

874
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:49,585
Hey, Adam?

875
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:52,713
Listen.

876
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:58,473
I just want you to have my cell number.

877
00:55:58,564 --> 00:56:02,807
Just if you need anything. You have it.

878
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:06,147
Thanks. Did I just, like, score your digits?

879
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:11,482
- No.
- No. That was a joke.

880
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:13,571
That's fine.

881
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:15,573
- I don't know why I said that.
- No, that's okay.

882
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:17,575
That would be inappropriate.

883
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:19,031
Of course. I know that.

884
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:21,458
It's a defense mechanism. And that's fine.

885
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,122
Yeah.

886
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:26,671
That's for emergencies.

887
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:30,258
- And if you need someone to talk to.
- Yeah.

888
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:33,261
- Good night. Okay.
- Good night. Thank you.

889
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:41,645
<i>The great white.</i>

890
00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:46,942
<i>It is the largest predator in the sea.</i>

891
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:50,896
I thought the deserts were crazy.
The ocean's fucking nuts, man.

892
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:52,197
I like the trees.

893
00:56:52,701 --> 00:56:54,066
The trees are gonna be bananas.

894
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:55,196
Jesus!

895
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:01,407
You okay?

896
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,584
- Lift your elbows above your ears.
- What are you talking about?

897
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:07,253
- It helps you stop coughing.
- I'm not doing that.

898
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,256
I always heard it would
help you stop coughing.

899
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:19,637
I'm just here to pick up my things

900
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:22,891
and then I'll get out of your way.

901
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:26,348
- Yeah, I put all your things in a box.
- Okay.

902
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:28,605
It's outside the door.

903
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:30,686
You walked right past it.

904
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,270
Oh.

905
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:35,153
Well, then I guess I'll be on my way.

906
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:41,242
You're smoking weed?

907
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,206
Well, it's medicinal.

908
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,830
You got a prescription
for medicinal marijuana?

909
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:49,209
No, I got a prescription
for medicinal marijuana.

910
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,210
Adam was too afraid.

911
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:54,134
Well, what's wrong with you, Kyle?

912
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:56,086
I have night blindness.

913
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:59,594
My cones and rods are askew

914
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:02,847
and weed fixes it.

915
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:07,981
You took down my painting.

916
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:11,235
Well, it didn't really fit there
with the new TV.

917
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,568
Adam, can I talk to you outside
for a second, please?

918
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,071
Yeah.

919
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:20,740
It's all right.

920
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:29,245
So, how are you feeling?

921
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:31,913
Pretty awesome.

922
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:38,136
I wanted to tell you that I'm really sorry.

923
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:40,926
Well...

924
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,009
I'm sorry, too.

925
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:47,722
I mean, I know this wasn't easy for you.

926
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:53,481
I'm sorry I didn't come to your opening.
It's just because I hate you so much.

927
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,401
I'm glad you didn't come.

928
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:04,496
It was a complete disaster.

929
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:08,287
No one bought any of my paintings.

930
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,463
That's weird, they're so good.

931
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:16,128
Really?

932
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,335
Yeah, they're great.
I'm sorry that happened.

933
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:21,342
It's just, you know,
you'll get them next time.

934
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:23,931
Oh, God.

935
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:29,138
I don't want to break up.

936
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,940
I can do better.

937
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:38,439
We can start over again,

938
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:42,651
and I'll just do better.

939
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:44,911
You should go.

940
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:52,911
Really, you should. You should go.

941
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:55,338
I don't want to go.
I want to stay here with you.

942
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,837
No. No. You know what? Seriously.

943
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:02,671
You should get
the fuck off my porch. Now.

944
01:00:07,479 --> 01:00:09,015
That's the box.

945
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,982
- Your painting?
- I made it for you.

946
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,029
<i>I was all right</i>

947
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:30,745
<i>For a while</i>

948
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:35,545
<i>I could smile for a while</i>

949
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:41,085
<i>But I saw you last night</i>
<i>You held my hand so tight</i>

950
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:45,173
<i>As you stopped to say, "Hello"</i>

951
01:00:46,935 --> 01:00:49,597
<i>You wished me well</i>

952
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:52,012
<i>You couldn't tell</i>

953
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:59,187
<i>That I'd been crying over you</i>

954
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:04,320
<i>Crying over you</i>

955
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:08,487
<i>Then you said, "So long"</i>

956
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:13,200
<i>Left me standing all alone</i>

957
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:14,455
<i>Alone and crying</i>

958
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:16,662
- It actually looks a lot better.
- It's not that bad like this.

959
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,542
Yeah. We could hang this up.

960
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,546
You were around before TV, right?

961
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,761
No, 'cause I want to hear about the radio.

962
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:29,512
Because the radio used to be like
a really... We work in radio, right?

963
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:30,843
Yeah.

964
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:33,019
Like, they talk about people
just sitting around

965
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:35,188
and listening to the radio, like, actively.

966
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:36,890
Glued to the radio. Yeah.

967
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:38,191
Well, what did you listen to?

968
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:39,609
<i>Little Orphan Annie.</i>

969
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,863
<i>What did you look at while you were</i>
<i>listening to it? Just nothing?</i>

970
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:45,361
It engaged everything somehow.

971
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:47,283
<i>What kind of stuff do you guys do?</i>

972
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,031
I'm doing this piece on a volcano.

973
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:51,704
I do radio that I think people
would actually want to listen to.

974
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,782
Mostly stuff about food.

975
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:56,368
- Best hamburger. Best hamburger in Seattle.
- People like to listen...

976
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:58,670
You'd listen to that as opposed to,
"Hey, coming up next,

977
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:01,631
"you're gonna hear a guy talk about
a volcano for twenty minutes."

978
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,254
- You know what I'd do?
- What?

979
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:04,801
I'd turn on the TV.

980
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:07,049
Yeah.
That would be a very good idea.

981
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,471
It's not the same.

982
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:10,678
What do you mean,
it's not the same?

983
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:13,055
You get audio and video.

984
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:16,138
Guys, Bernie blended up some Wheatgrass.

985
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:17,313
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

986
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,891
It's like drinking liquid lawn cuttings.

987
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:24,529
Jesus! Bernie, Adam.

988
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:26,823
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

989
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:27,990
Hi, Adam.

990
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:29,568
And this is my friend, Kyle.

991
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:31,619
- Oh, God.
- Good, you like it.

992
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,655
It's not good.

993
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,666
So, Adam, I'm surprised.

994
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:40,162
The way Mitch talks about you
I thought you were much older.

995
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:42,589
He's 85 years old.
He just looks really good.

996
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:46,043
Okay, I got to go.

997
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:47,593
No, no, honey. Come on, stay.

998
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:49,546
Stick around. I haven't seen you all day.

999
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:51,009
- Are you all right?
- I'm good.

1000
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:53,012
Good stuff. Good stuff.

1001
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:56,139
Really good stuff. I love you.

1002
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,513
I love you, too.

1003
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,608
Mom, I'm sorry.
I can't talk about this anymore.

1004
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:04,778
I'm at an appointment, okay?
And I'm late already.

1005
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:06,604
Yes, I'm here. I'm standing in the office

1006
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,531
talking on the phone to you.
So I'm just gonna get off.

1007
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:09,903
<i>I just want to know</i>
<i>if you tried those recipes.</i>

1008
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:11,360
Okay.

1009
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:12,910
<i>Do you know what you're gonna make</i>
<i>for dinner?</i>

1010
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:14,863
I don't know what I'm gonna make
for dinner.

1011
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:18,166
I'll figure something out, okay?
I'm hanging up now. Goodbye.

1012
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:19,459
<i>Bye. I love you.</i>

1013
01:03:19,546 --> 01:03:21,377
Me, too. Bye.

1014
01:03:22,674 --> 01:03:25,757
God. Sorry about that.

1015
01:03:25,844 --> 01:03:28,802
Don't worry about it. I have parents, too.

1016
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:31,220
Do yours give you migraines?

1017
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:34,758
Well, I would talk to my therapist
about my parents.

1018
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:35,929
Really?

1019
01:03:36,021 --> 01:03:39,309
Yeah, we could do role play.
I'll be your mom.

1020
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:41,890
Oh, God, no. That's disgusting.

1021
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,184
Why is that disgusting?

1022
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:46,485
Uh...

1023
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:50,031
No, it's not. I mean, okay, my mom...

1024
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:55,321
I don't know. She's a crazy person.
She just worries all day every day.

1025
01:03:55,832 --> 01:04:00,451
And honestly it annoys the shit out of me.
It's way too much.

1026
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:02,831
And it's not helpful

1027
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:06,164
and I can't talk to her.
I don't call her back.

1028
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:09,793
It's a problem.

1029
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:12,925
So she's got this husband
that can't talk to her

1030
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:16,053
and this son that won't?

1031
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:23,106
Yeah, I guess.

1032
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:26,354
Makes you kind of a dick.

1033
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,111
Me?

1034
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,941
Is that like the medical term?

1035
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:36,028
Yeah, I mean, listen...

1036
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:38,742
You can't change who your parents are.

1037
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:42,997
The only thing you can change
is how you choose to deal with that.

1038
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:50,588
Aren't you supposed to, like, subtly
manipulate me into figuring this stuff out?

1039
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:52,088
Not just call me on my shit?

1040
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:56,799
Yeah, you cleaned my car.
So we're completely beyond that.

1041
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:08,185
It's weird, isn't it? Shouldn't have
done it. Shouldn't have gone for it.

1042
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:11,521
- It was good. It was good. It's all right.
- No, it wasn't. It was so forced, I'm sorry.

1043
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:14,904
- Try it again. I was too far.
- Okay.

1044
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:16,780
- If I'm a little closer.
- It'll make it really natural.

1045
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:18,031
- Yeah.
- Totally.

1046
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:22,658
That was better.

1047
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,127
Okay.

1048
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:34,966
- You're all set.
- Thanks.

1049
01:05:39,227 --> 01:05:40,763
Where's Mitch?

1050
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:45,263
He died last night.

1051
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:55,110
We were just with him. He was fine.
What happened?

1052
01:05:55,994 --> 01:05:58,155
What does it matter? His heart stopped.

1053
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:32,944
"He leads me in the paths
of righteousness for his name's sake.

1054
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:35,317
"Even though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death

1055
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:38,616
"I will fear no evil for thou art with me.

1056
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:41,615
"Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

1057
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:45,870
"Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies."

1058
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:56,005
<i>Nation, I have your test results.</i>

1059
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:59,967
<i>Good news! You're me-positive.</i>

1060
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:03,596
<i>This is</i> Cheating Death
<i>with Dr. Stephen T. Colbert.</i>

1061
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:05,677
<i>... speculation, Mount Moa Moa,</i>

1062
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:09,356
<i>located on the highlands of Savai'i,</i>
<i>erupted early this morning,</i>

1063
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:13,651
<i>shooting a plume of black ash and smoke</i>
<i>nearly four miles into the air.</i>

1064
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:17,071
<i>Initial reports this morning suggested</i>
<i>that Mount Moa Moa was getting weaker.</i>

1065
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:21,197
<i>Our analyst can now confirm that</i>
<i>the volcano is actually growing stronger.</i>

1066
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:25,701
<i>Again, Mount Moa Moa has just erupted.</i>
<i>This is live footage taken...</i>

1067
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:47,931
So, I think I'm starting to realize
I'm probably gonna die.

1068
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:52,649
- Did something happen?
- No, it's just... Look at me.

1069
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:58,814
I wake up and I look in the mirror
and, like, it's pretty obvious, you know.

1070
01:08:01,286 --> 01:08:06,701
Mitch died. Alan's probably gonna die.

1071
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:09,825
And, you know, so am I.

1072
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:12,164
You don't know that.

1073
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:14,496
And a lot of what you're feeling right now
is from the treatment.

1074
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:17,378
I know, but it's... Look.

1075
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:21,294
Thank you,
but you don't have to try and cheer me up.

1076
01:08:21,389 --> 01:08:26,679
I'm actually really okay with it. You know.
Okay, I'm gonna die.

1077
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:28,100
You're gonna die.

1078
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:30,803
You know, hopefully a lot later than I am.

1079
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:33,935
It's just what happens. And, you know,

1080
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:38,027
it doesn't really mean anything anyway.

1081
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:41,443
Okay. I mean, Adam, right now

1082
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:44,651
you're going through
what's called the alienation phase.

1083
01:08:44,746 --> 01:08:47,783
And I know that you feel really helpless.

1084
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:51,458
But I think it's important to remember
that the way you feel

1085
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:53,785
is completely normal
for someone in your situation.

1086
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:58,464
Sorry, but I just have to call you on this.

1087
01:08:58,551 --> 01:08:59,882
It's just bullshit.

1088
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,676
It's what everybody has been saying
from the beginning.

1089
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:05,847
Like, "Well, you'll feel better,"
and, "Don't worry," and, "This is all fine."

1090
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:08,390
And, like, it's not. You know?

1091
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:12,311
I don't know why everybody's
so fucking scared to just say it.

1092
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,263
Like, "You're dying, dude."

1093
01:09:16,444 --> 01:09:21,029
It makes it worse that
no one will just say it.

1094
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:24,824
Okay. Um...

1095
01:09:27,455 --> 01:09:31,039
Adam, I'm here to help you.
I'm trying to help you.

1096
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,285
Why?

1097
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:36,369
So thirty years from now
you can be at some cocktail party,

1098
01:09:36,464 --> 01:09:39,831
and tell an inspiring anecdote
about your third patient ever,

1099
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:42,759
and how you coached him
into feeling normal right before he died?

1100
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:45,545
Okay, Adam, I'm sorry
if I'm saying the wrong things.

1101
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,052
I'm trying. I really am.

1102
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:52,602
No, you know what? This just isn't working.
I don't know why I came here.

1103
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:06,403
<i>This is Kyle.</i>
<i>I'm not around. Leave a message.</i>

1104
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:11,371
Hey, man.
I'm just calling to see if you could take me

1105
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:14,915
to the doctor's appointment tomorrow.

1106
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:20,876
It's the big one. So...

1107
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,474
<i>Oh, my God! What's wrong?</i>

1108
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:44,271
Hi, Mom.

1109
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:45,901
The doctor's just in
with another patient.

1110
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:47,653
He should be out in a few minutes.

1111
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:49,741
Are you guys holding up all right?

1112
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:53,071
It's cold in here. Is there any way
you can lower the air conditioning?

1113
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:56,579
Unfortunately the temperature
is controlled by a central thermostat.

1114
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:00,787
My son has cancer.

1115
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:04,207
Really, if I could I would.
But there is nothing I can do.

1116
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:06,629
Don't worry about it. I'm fine.

1117
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:09,504
- Are you sure? I can get you a blanket.
- I'm really okay. Thanks.

1118
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:11,388
- I'd love a blanket.
- We're fine.

1119
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:14,971
Okay, but if you need anything
you let me know.

1120
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:24,852
I don't like her.

1121
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:30,612
You're warm.

1122
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:34,287
I'm fine.

1123
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:46,624
Hmm.

1124
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:50,299
- What?
- Nothing.

1125
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:51,629
What?

1126
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:54,716
He just went to a state college, that's all.

1127
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:56,600
You're unbelievable.

1128
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:59,224
I just worry you're not getting
the best care possible.

1129
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,306
Would you just stop it? Please?

1130
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,891
I'm not him. I can take care of myself.

1131
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:07,228
It's just so hard
when you won't let me take care of you.

1132
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:09,564
- It's just really hard.
- I am letting you take care of me.

1133
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:12,150
You drove me here,
didn't you? Didn't you?

1134
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:37,641
And what about you?

1135
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:39,594
What about me?

1136
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:42,430
How are you?

1137
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:48,941
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1138
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:51,989
You know, what's going on in your life?

1139
01:12:52,076 --> 01:12:57,036
The highlight of my week is this
cancer support group I've been going to.

1140
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:59,535
You're going to a support group?

1141
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:03,831
It's for parents whose kids have cancer.

1142
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:08,794
I didn't know you were doing that.

1143
01:13:09,844 --> 01:13:12,460
How could you? You never call me back.

1144
01:13:17,018 --> 01:13:19,555
You're right. I'm sorry.

1145
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:25,769
You don't have to say you're sorry.

1146
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:36,408
Sorry to keep you folks waiting.

1147
01:13:41,876 --> 01:13:44,743
Anyway, I will cut to the chase.

1148
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:47,670
The cancer is not responding to the chemo.

1149
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:53,551
As you can see the tumor is continuing
to grow here along the nerve.

1150
01:13:53,638 --> 01:13:57,005
We have to remove it now,
or we risk metastasis.

1151
01:13:57,099 --> 01:14:00,762
- Okay, so what do we do?
- We need to operate.

1152
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:02,184
Now I've moved some things around

1153
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:05,138
and I can get you in this Thursday morning
with Dr. Walderson.

1154
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:07,188
She is one of our finest neurosurgeons.

1155
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:10,359
But he's gonna be okay, right?
You're going to fix it.

1156
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:14,276
Considering the placement
and the size of the tumor,

1157
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:16,904
a surgery of this nature
is always very dangerous

1158
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:19,610
and potentially life-threatening itself.

1159
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:22,617
The surgeons will attempt to be
very aggressive.

1160
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:26,542
However if we are not successful
in removing the cancer,

1161
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:29,746
then unfortunately
we will be out of options.

1162
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:41,803
I'm not gonna bring up the fact
that your surgery is tomorrow.

1163
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:44,306
I'm not even thinking about it.
So, don't worry about it,

1164
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:47,139
'cause I'm not gonna bring it up.

1165
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:49,849
You remember the last time we were here?

1166
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:52,401
Yeah. It was prom night.

1167
01:14:56,575 --> 01:15:00,909
The memory seems really far away.

1168
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:05,957
Yeah. It was a long time ago.
I don't even remember who you went with.

1169
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:07,624
Nora Mattingly.

1170
01:15:07,712 --> 01:15:11,500
That girl... That girl sucked.
You knew how to pick them.

1171
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:14,673
- Even then I think you knew.
- Yeah.

1172
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,751
Well, she seemed sweet.

1173
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:19,178
No, she didn't. She always sucked.

1174
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:22,052
- You just always hate my girlfriends.
- That's not true.

1175
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:24,342
Okay, it is actually.

1176
01:15:24,437 --> 01:15:28,305
But it's because you always date people
who are fucking dickheads, man.

1177
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:31,607
You date needy bitches. Why?

1178
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:39,903
It's fucking cold.

1179
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:45,029
And it's only midnight.

1180
01:15:45,124 --> 01:15:47,866
Dude, let's go to the bar, man.
Let's try to get laid.

1181
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:51,418
- What's the fucking point?
- Come on. Live in the now.

1182
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:54,212
- I have fun with that.
- I know you have fun with it.

1183
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,541
Well, you could, too, maybe. Let's do it.

1184
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:57,966
You're drunk.

1185
01:15:58,054 --> 01:16:00,670
It worked. Take your hat off.

1186
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:04,424
- You're just gonna leave this here?
- A homeless gentleman will collect it.

1187
01:16:04,769 --> 01:16:06,805
- Oh, fuck.
- Are you drunk?

1188
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:08,727
- You're really drunk.
- I'm a little drunk.

1189
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,054
You think I should drive?

1190
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:13,312
I would let you drive
but you don't know how.

1191
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:17,486
You don't have a license even.
That's so funny.

1192
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:20,773
It might be my last chance.

1193
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:23,985
- So you want to drive, right now?
- Yeah.

1194
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,571
That's what you want to do?

1195
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:28,951
That's your make-a-wish? To drive?

1196
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:32,710
We could be having sex with hookers
while skydiving right now.

1197
01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:36,164
And instead you want to do something
I learned to do when I was fifteen?

1198
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:38,082
Can I have the keys?

1199
01:16:43,182 --> 01:16:44,843
Okay. Be careful.

1200
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:47,508
Whoa!

1201
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:50,018
Just drive carefully.

1202
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:56,150
Don't change my seat adjustment, okay?
It's all in places I like.

1203
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:59,942
Okay. Okay. Now the first thing...

1204
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:05,359
What the fuck!

1205
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:10,326
Make a left.
Make a left! It's a one-way street.

1206
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:12,829
What the fuck! Jesus Christ!

1207
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,956
There's a car! Wrong way! Wrong way!

1208
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:18,960
Christ, dude. What the hell?
Adam! Stop, man!

1209
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:20,166
Stop!

1210
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:23,882
What the fuck are you doing, man?

1211
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:26,635
- You're being an idiot right now.
- Get out.

1212
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:28,135
- Get out? This is my car.
- Get out of the car.

1213
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:30,263
- Get out. Just get out!
- Don't hit me!

1214
01:17:30,354 --> 01:17:31,890
- I can't fucking let you do this.
- Get out!

1215
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:33,687
Jesus Christ, man!

1216
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:35,560
Shit.

1217
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:02,959
Oh, no.

1218
01:18:03,596 --> 01:18:05,552
No, you are not calling her, man!

1219
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:09,098
After what she did to you!
You're a pussy, Adam.

1220
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,926
You're a selfish piece of shit!

1221
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:15,809
You care more about getting yourself
fucking laid than being my friend.

1222
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:24,613
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, it's Adam.

1223
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:28,572
Adam? It's midnight. What's going on?

1224
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:31,536
I'm just probably having
a nervous breakdown.

1225
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:34,619
I think I just fractured my larynx.

1226
01:18:37,254 --> 01:18:39,961
I'm really, really glad that you called.

1227
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:46,298
I just want it to be over.
I'm so fucking tired of being sick.

1228
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:56,137
<i>You know, if this surgery doesn't work,</i>
<i>it's... That's it.</i>

1229
01:18:57,816 --> 01:19:02,435
And I've never, you know...
I've never been to fucking Canada.

1230
01:19:02,529 --> 01:19:05,942
I've never told a girl I loved her.

1231
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,568
<i>It sounds stupid, doesn't it?</i>

1232
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:12,278
No, it doesn't.

1233
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:17,416
Sorry. I was such an asshole the other day.

1234
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:22,121
<i>No, I was an asshole.</i>
<i>I was totally unprepared for you.</i>

1235
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:25,089
This job is really hard.

1236
01:19:28,138 --> 01:19:30,504
If I fuck up
I can ruin somebody's whole life.

1237
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:34,592
Well, I guess we're both beginners at this.

1238
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:35,802
<i>Yeah.</i>

1239
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,638
<i>What were you doing when I called?</i>

1240
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:42,187
Were you on Facebook?

1241
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:47,859
You know, stalking my ex-boyfriend actually
isn't the only thing I do in my free time.

1242
01:19:49,952 --> 01:19:51,817
I wish you were my girlfriend.

1243
01:19:59,878 --> 01:20:01,834
Girlfriends can be nice.

1244
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,211
<i>You just had a bad one.</i>

1245
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:09,551
I bet you would be a good one.

1246
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:17,927
Let me in,
man. Jesus. It's fucking freezing.

1247
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:19,808
<i>I'm gonna go.</i>

1248
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:21,684
- Yeah, it's no problem.
- <i>Thanks.</i>

1249
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:24,020
Thanks for everything.

1250
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:26,231
Good night.

1251
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:44,244
Come here, boy.

1252
01:22:45,586 --> 01:22:46,746
Yeah.

1253
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:42,347
Okay. Ready?

1254
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:44,883
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1255
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:47,477
- It's gonna be good. It's going to be fine.
- Yeah.

1256
01:23:47,564 --> 01:23:49,646
- Adam.
- That's your mom.

1257
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:50,848
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1258
01:23:50,943 --> 01:23:52,308
Awesome.

1259
01:23:54,738 --> 01:23:56,899
So, I'll just... I'll park the car, I guess.

1260
01:23:56,990 --> 01:24:00,198
And then I'll come in and I'll see you
before you go in there, right?

1261
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:03,197
Yeah, there's...
It depends on if they bring me in first.

1262
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:05,700
- If not before then...
- Right after.

1263
01:24:05,791 --> 01:24:08,203
- Yeah, I'll see you after.
- Okay.

1264
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:17,465
- Yeah.
- Take care, man.

1265
01:24:20,973 --> 01:24:23,464
Okay. I'll see you in there.

1266
01:24:27,854 --> 01:24:29,094
Thanks.

1267
01:24:38,532 --> 01:24:39,863
- Good morning, Adam.
- Hi.

1268
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:42,657
I'm Dr. Walderson.
I'm gonna be doing your surgery today.

1269
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,326
- How are you feeling?
- Great, thanks.

1270
01:24:44,413 --> 01:24:46,074
Good. Good, good.

1271
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:50,791
So, we're gonna take excellent care
of you. The surgical team is top notch.

1272
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:52,538
Just try to relax.

1273
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:54,870
- See you later.
- Thanks.

1274
01:24:54,965 --> 01:24:56,876
- What's this?
- Standard paperwork.

1275
01:24:57,009 --> 01:25:01,924
Hospital liability and disclaimer forms,
and organ donor authorization.

1276
01:25:02,014 --> 01:25:03,845
- Sign right there.
- Okay.

1277
01:25:07,311 --> 01:25:08,642
Thanks.

1278
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:13,938
- I got a new coat.
- Yeah?

1279
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:17,359
Brooks Brothers. Silk pockets, feel.

1280
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:19,652
- Feel.
- I'm feeling.

1281
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:21,526
- Nice?
- Yeah.

1282
01:25:21,617 --> 01:25:22,857
Listen.

1283
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:25,859
I know it's a little hard to follow
everything that's going on right now.

1284
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:30,573
But I just want you to know,
I love you, very much.

1285
01:25:34,671 --> 01:25:37,663
- Okay.
- Okay, Dad.

1286
01:25:38,383 --> 01:25:39,498
Okay.

1287
01:25:40,218 --> 01:25:41,924
Hello, Adam. I'm Dr. Lee.

1288
01:25:42,012 --> 01:25:43,548
I am here to administer your anesthesia.

1289
01:25:43,639 --> 01:25:44,879
Okay. Hi.

1290
01:25:45,057 --> 01:25:46,718
Excuse me, please.

1291
01:25:47,351 --> 01:25:50,468
Now, just relax. I'm going to inject
the anesthesia through your IV.

1292
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:52,803
It's gonna take a few moments
before you start to feel the effects.

1293
01:25:52,898 --> 01:25:54,183
You're doing it now?

1294
01:25:54,274 --> 01:25:56,481
If you guys just want to head over
to the waiting room that'd be great.

1295
01:25:56,568 --> 01:25:59,685
- And how long does it last?
- That really depends on the individual.

1296
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:01,611
Right, but how do you know
it's gonna last long enough

1297
01:26:01,698 --> 01:26:05,486
so I don't wake up in
the middle of the surgery?

1298
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:08,618
So that you make sure
that I'm gonna wake up after.

1299
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:09,740
Mom.

1300
01:26:11,291 --> 01:26:13,907
Sweetie, you're gonna be just fine.

1301
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:24,756
I'm really sorry but we need
to get Adam to the operating room.

1302
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:27,470
Could you just wait a moment, please?

1303
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:33,431
I'm sorry.

1304
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:37,772
I love you.

1305
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:43,438

01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:38,726
It's been five hours.

1332
01:28:39,898 --> 01:28:40,887
Has it?

1333
01:28:42,234 --> 01:28:44,725
Something's wrong,
we should have heard by now.

1334
01:28:46,363 --> 01:28:48,900
Don't worry.
Adam's gonna be fine. Okay?

1335
01:28:52,786 --> 01:28:55,493
- Um, Adam Lerner?
- Yeah.

1336
01:28:57,290 --> 01:29:00,202
Dr. Walderson's one of the best surgeons
in the country.

1337
01:29:00,293 --> 01:29:01,954
So, he's in good hands.

1338
01:29:03,088 --> 01:29:04,453
Who are you?

1339
01:29:06,299 --> 01:29:07,789
I'm Katherine.

1340
01:29:09,135 --> 01:29:13,048
- I'm...
- Therapist. Yeah.

1341
01:29:13,306 --> 01:29:15,297
I'm Kyle. I'm Adam's friend.

1342
01:29:15,392 --> 01:29:16,928
Hi. Hi.

1343
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:19,847
These are Adam's parents.

1344
01:29:22,899 --> 01:29:24,059
It's nice to meet you guys.

1345
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:27,358
Did he say I'm a dick? 'Cause I'm not.

1346
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:30,562
I want you to know I smothered him
because I love him.

1347
01:29:34,661 --> 01:29:36,367
Seriously, did he say anything?

1348
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:42,495
I can't. I wouldn't talk about
that kind of thing anyway.

1349
01:29:52,304 --> 01:29:54,135
Mr. and Mrs. Lerner?

1350
01:29:56,433 --> 01:30:00,176
So, as you can imagine with a surgery
of this magnitude,

1351
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:03,182
there were some unforeseen complications.

1352
01:30:03,273 --> 01:30:06,356
The bone erosion was much greater
than initially anticipated.

1353
01:30:06,443 --> 01:30:10,652
We had to remove part of the hip and pelvis,
as well as most of the right psoas muscle.

1354
01:30:11,489 --> 01:30:15,482
We also had to remove a good amount of
the sheath tissue around the sciatic nerve.

1355
01:30:16,202 --> 01:30:19,820
It's not gonna be an easy road back,
but he's gonna be okay.

1356
01:30:20,373 --> 01:30:22,238
He's gonna be okay?

1357
01:30:23,043 --> 01:30:24,999
You should start
with that information, okay?

1358
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:27,452
That should be the first thing you say.

1359
01:30:27,547 --> 01:30:29,083
Good.

1360
01:30:29,174 --> 01:30:31,005
He's gonna be okay.

1361
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:33,674
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.

1362
01:30:39,017 --> 01:30:40,177
Mommy.

1363
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:44,427
My little boy.

1364
01:30:44,522 --> 01:30:45,932
- Hi, Dad.
- Adam.

1365
01:30:46,024 --> 01:30:49,642
- It's nice here. We got a good room.
- I know.

1366
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:51,101
We need to go on more vacations.

1367
01:30:51,196 --> 01:30:55,405
Yes, we'll go on a huge vacation.
We'll go to Hawaii.

1368
01:30:58,662 --> 01:31:00,198
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

1369
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:02,119
What's up?

1370
01:31:02,207 --> 01:31:05,699
I'm afraid to touch you,
but it's good to see you, dude. Yeah.

1371
01:31:05,794 --> 01:31:07,079
Boom.

1372
01:31:07,253 --> 01:31:10,711
You look... You look really good.

1373
01:31:10,799 --> 01:31:13,882
I'm high as a motherfucker.

1374
01:31:14,177 --> 01:31:15,758
we don't get high.

1375
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:17,506
Cool, man.

1376
01:31:32,445 --> 01:31:34,060
It's you.

1377
01:31:34,155 --> 01:31:35,770
It is me.

1378
01:31:38,201 --> 01:31:39,486
How are you feeling?

1379
01:31:40,412 --> 01:31:45,076
Great. I love morphine.

1380
01:31:46,876 --> 01:31:48,582
What time is it?

1381
01:31:48,837 --> 01:31:50,577
Um... It's 8:00.

1382
01:31:52,048 --> 01:31:54,664
I was just working late
so I thought I would stop by.

1383
01:31:54,759 --> 01:31:58,092
Working late?
Do you have a new patient?

1384
01:31:58,763 --> 01:32:01,049
I got a few new patients actually.

1385
01:32:01,141 --> 01:32:02,551
That's good.

1386
01:32:04,644 --> 01:32:07,852
I want to make you pancakes sometime.

1387
01:32:08,773 --> 01:32:12,357
- That is really nice, Adam.
- You're gonna like it.

1388
01:32:34,799 --> 01:32:36,630
I'm peeing right now.

1389
01:32:38,553 --> 01:32:40,544
I'm not gonna look.

1390
01:32:49,314 --> 01:32:50,929
Oh, it's gross!

1391
01:32:51,024 --> 01:32:53,481
Oh, God. Okay. I just need to...

1392
01:32:54,611 --> 01:32:55,600
Oh!

1393
01:32:56,821 --> 01:32:59,904
Oh, I keep looking back at it,
thinking it's gonna be less gross.

1394
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:01,401
Can we just get it over with? Come on.

1395
01:33:01,493 --> 01:33:03,905
- Your mom does this?
- She does it all the time.

1396
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:05,201
This is like <i>Saw</i> shit.

1397
01:33:05,288 --> 01:33:08,200
Your words are so comforting.
It's really reassuring.

1398
01:33:08,291 --> 01:33:11,749
- You're a good friend.
- Okay. I'm just gonna do it.

1399
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:13,918
I'm just gonna act like it's nothing.

1400
01:33:14,005 --> 01:33:16,166
- I'm really proud of you, man.
- Okay. Let's just go.

1401
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:17,997
Let's just do this.

1402
01:33:18,343 --> 01:33:21,961
Oh, I'm doing it. I'm inside of you!

1403
01:33:22,055 --> 01:33:24,671
- Wait, wait, wait. Is that your finger?
- What?

1404
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:26,176
- Is that your finger?
- No.

1405
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:28,633
- There's Q-tips.
- I know. I got one.

1406
01:33:28,728 --> 01:33:30,889
- That was your finger.
- It wasn't. What? Is it bad if it was?

1407
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:32,265
Did you wash your hands?

1408
01:33:32,357 --> 01:33:34,973
It was a Q-tip the whole time.
Don't worry about it.

1409
01:33:35,068 --> 01:33:38,231
This looks like Kuato
from <i>Total Recall.</i>

1410
01:33:38,321 --> 01:33:41,028
- "The oxygen."
- No! Don't do that.

1411
01:33:42,242 --> 01:33:45,780
Can we get this going? It's 7:30 now.
Come on, put the bandage on.

1412
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:47,201
Excuse me.

1413
01:33:49,874 --> 01:33:52,957
And you are ready for your date.

1414
01:33:53,753 --> 01:33:56,870
All right-y, there we go.

1415
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:04,552
That's crazy. I look pretty good.

1416
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:06,675
- I'd fuck you.
- Thanks.

1417
01:34:08,184 --> 01:34:09,390
Who could that be?

1418
01:34:09,477 --> 01:34:11,058
Go answer it. Just go.

1419
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:16,056
- Hey.
- Hey.

1420
01:34:16,151 --> 01:34:17,687
You look nice.

1421
01:34:17,777 --> 01:34:21,520
Thanks. You, too. You look super nice.

1422
01:34:23,283 --> 01:34:25,365
- You want to come in?
- Yeah.

1423
01:34:25,451 --> 01:34:26,816
Nice place.

1424
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:30,035
Look at you. Walking up a storm.

1425
01:34:30,123 --> 01:34:32,239
Oh, la, la, la, la.

1426
01:34:34,836 --> 01:34:36,576
- You remember Kyle.
- Yeah, hi.

1427
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:38,536
- Hi.
- Good to see you. We met before.

1428
01:34:38,631 --> 01:34:41,293
I see you brought pizza which is good
because I haven't fed him yet all day.

1429
01:34:41,384 --> 01:34:43,124
I did just change the dressing on his wound.

1430
01:34:43,219 --> 01:34:44,959
- Yeah, he came to...
- If it starts seeping though,

1431
01:34:45,054 --> 01:34:46,339
I left all the stuff out.

1432
01:34:46,431 --> 01:34:48,513
There's some Vicodin in the bathroom
if you need it.

1433
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:52,013
I know people take it recreationally,
but he actually needs it for his aches.

1434
01:34:52,103 --> 01:34:54,185
Are there channels he can't watch?

1435
01:34:56,441 --> 01:34:58,682
That's funny. See, she's cool.

1436
01:34:58,776 --> 01:35:00,641
So, you're doing your doctorate, I hear?
That's...

1437
01:35:00,737 --> 01:35:01,726
- Dude?
- Yeah.

1438
01:35:01,821 --> 01:35:03,061
- You're awesome.
- Yeah.

1439
01:35:03,156 --> 01:35:05,021
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Okay.

1440
01:35:05,116 --> 01:35:07,448
- She's cool. She's funny.
- I know.

1441
01:35:25,428 --> 01:35:26,838
So...

1442
01:35:28,932 --> 01:35:30,263
So...

1443
01:35:32,769 --> 01:35:34,054
Now what?

1444
01:35:40,485 --> 01:35:46,321
<i>Unsealed on a porch a letter sat</i>

1445
01:35:47,283 --> 01:35:52,118
<i>Then you said,</i>
<i>"I want to leave it again"</i>

1446
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:59,914
<i>Once I saw her</i>
<i>on a beach of weathered sand</i>

1447
01:36:00,838 --> 01:36:05,673
<i>And on the sand,</i>
<i>"I wanna leave it again"</i>

1448
01:36:06,177 --> 01:36:07,337
<i>Yeah</i>

1449
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:12,464
<i>On a weekend, I wanna wish it all away, yeah</i>

1450
01:36:12,934 --> 01:36:19,681
<i>And they called and I said that</i>
<i>"I want what I said," then I call out again</i>

1451
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:27,730
<i>And the reason ought to leave</i>
<i>her calm, I know</i>

1452
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:33,117
<i>I said, "I know what I waited,</i>
<i>not a boxer or the bag"</i>

1453
01:36:33,371 --> 01:36:38,536
<i>Oh, yeah, can you see them</i>

1454
01:36:39,544 --> 01:36:41,660
<i>Out on the porch?</i>

1455
01:36:42,505 --> 01:36:47,044
<i>Yeah, but they don't wave</i>

1456
01:36:47,135 --> 01:36:53,847
<i>I see them</i>
<i>round the front way, yeah</i>

1457
01:36:53,933 --> 01:36:59,394
<i>And I know and I know</i>
<i>I don't wanna stay</i>

1458
01:37:00,606 --> 01:37:02,016
<i>At all</i>

1459
01:37:03,067 --> 01:37:06,025
<i>I don't wanna stay</i>

1460
01:37:09,991 --> 01:37:12,323
<i>I don't wanna stay</i>

1461
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:15,823
<i>I don't... Don't wanna... Oh...</i>

1462
01:37:17,457 --> 01:37:18,742
<i>Yeah</i>

1463
01:37:25,131 --> 01:37:28,999
<i>Ooh...</i>

1464
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:36,640
<i>Oh...</i>
