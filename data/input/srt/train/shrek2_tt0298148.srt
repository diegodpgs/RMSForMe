You're all grown up.

311
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:55,430
- Who are you?
- Oh, sweet pea!

312
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,530
I'm your fairy godmother.

313
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,240
- I have a fairy godmother?
- Shush, shush.

314
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:04,680
Now, don't worry.
I'm here to make it all better.

Thank you very much,
Fairy Godmother,

339
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,150

[gasps and mutterings of disapproval]

- We didn't like you, anyway.

[dog barks]

344

Oh! You got a puppy?
All I got in my room was shampoo.

345
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,130
Oh, uh...

346
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,230
Fairy Godmother, furniture...

347
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,300
[giggles]

348
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,710
I'd like you to meet my husband, Shrek.

349
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,440
Your husband? What? What did you say?
When did this happen?

350
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,180
Shrek is the one who rescued me.

351
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:51,190
- But that can't be right.
- Oh, great, more relatives!

352
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,050
She's just trying to help.

353
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,350
Good! She can help us pack.
Get your coat, dear. We're leaving.

354
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,950
- What?
- I don't want to leave.

355
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,590
When did you decide this?

356
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,330
- Shortly after arriving.
- Look, I'm sorry...

357
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,770
No, that's all right.
I need to go, anyway.

358
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,170
But remember, dear.
If you should ever need me...

359
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,400
happiness...

360
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,200
is just a teardrop away.

361
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,840
Thanks, but we've got all
the happiness we need.

362
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,780
Happy, happy, happy...

363
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,040
[laughs] So I see.

364
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,980
Let's go, Kyle.

365
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,240
- Very nice, Shrek.
- What?

366
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,050
I told you coming here was a bad idea.

367
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,790
You could've at least tried
to get along with my father.

368
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,460
I don't think I was going to get
Daddy's blessing,

369
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,330
even if I did want it.

370
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,430
Do you think it might be nice
if somebody asked me what I wanted?

371
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,900
Sure. Do you want me
to pack for you?

372
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:46,880
You're unbelievable!
You're behaving like a...

373
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,940
- Go on! Say it!
- Like an ogre!

374
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,480
Here's a news flash for you!

375
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:55,480
Whether your parents like it or not...
I am an ogre!

376
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,250
- [yelps]
- [roars]

377
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:05,090
And guess what, Princess?
That's not about to change.

378
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:15,030
I've made changes for you, Shrek.
Think about that.

379
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:20,900
That's real smooth, Shrek.
"I'm an ogre!"

380
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,210
[mimics Shrek roaring]

381
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,240
[sniffling]

382
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,260
I knew this would happen.

383
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,270
[Lillian] You should.
You started it.

384
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,330
I can hardly believe that, Lillian.
He's the ogre. Not me.

385
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,880
I think, Harold, you're taking this
a little too personally.

386
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,310
This is Fiona's choice.

387
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,480
But she was supposed to choose
the prince we picked for her.

388
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:07,780
I mean, you expect me to give
my blessings to this... thing?

389
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:11,790
Fiona does.
And she will never forgive you if you don't.

390
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:16,490
I don't want to lose
our daughter again, Harold.

391
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:19,160
Oh, you act as if love
is totally predictable.

392
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,070
Don't you remember when
we were young?

393
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:25,140
We used to walk
down by the lily pond and...

394
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:28,440
- they were in bloom...
- Our first kiss.

395
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,910
It's not the same!

396
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,010
I don't think you realize that
our daughter has married a monster!

397
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,420
Oh, stop being such a drama king.

398
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:38,390
Fine! Pretend there's nothing wrong!

399
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,480
La, di, da, di, da!
Isn't it all wonderful!

400
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,580
I'd like to know
how it could get any worse!

401
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,920
- Hello, Harold.
- [gasps]

402
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,050
- What happened?
- Nothing, dear!

403
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:50,120
Just the old crusade wound
playing up a bit!

404
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,190
[chuckles]

405
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,930
I will just stretch it
out here for a while.

406
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,100
You better get in.
We need to talk.

407
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:59,300
Actually, Fairy Godmother,
off to bed.

408
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,040
[yawns] Already taken my pills,
and they tend to make me a bit drowsy.

409
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:06,980
So, how about... we make this
a quick visit. What?

410
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,950
Oh, hello.
Ha-ha-ha!

411
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,220
So, what's new?

412
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:18,020
You remember my son,
Prince Charming?

413
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:21,550
Is that you? My gosh!
It's been years.

414
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,790
When did you get back?

415
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:26,860
Oh, about five minutes ago, actually.

416
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,460
After I endured blistering winds,
scorching desert...

417
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,570
I climbed to the highest room
in the tallest tower...

418
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,040
Mommy can handle this.

419
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:40,240
He endures blistering winds
and scorching desert!

420
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,280
He climbs to the highest bloody room
of the tallest bloody tower...

421
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,480
And what does he find?

422
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,290
Some gender-confused wolf
telling him that his princess

423
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,260
is already married.

424
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,800
It wasn't my fault.
He didn't get there in time.

425
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,560
Stop the car!

426
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,000
[crash]

427
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,730
Harold.

428
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,460
You force me to do something
I really don't want to do.

429
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,510
[gasps] Where are we?

430
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:09,570
Hi. Welcome to Friar's Fat Boy!
May I take your order?

431
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:13,770
My diet is ruined!
I hope you're happy. Er... okay.

Two Renaissance Wraps,

- I will have the Medieval Meal.
- One Medieval Meal and, Harold...

434
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,360
- Curly fries?
- No, thank you.

435
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:25,160
- Sourdough soft taco, then?
- No, really, I'm fine.

436
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:29,130
Your order, Fairy Godmother.
This comes with the Medieval Meal.

437
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,360
There you are, dear.

438
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,600
We made a deal, Harold, and I assume
you don't want me to go back on my part.

439
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,870
[sighs deeply] Indeed not.

440
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:43,610
So, Fiona and Charming will be together.

441
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,170
- Yes.
- Believe me, Harold. It's what's best.

442
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,780
Not only for your daughter...

443
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:53,080
but for your Kingdom.

444
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,820
What am I supposed to do about it?

445
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,360
Use your imagination.

Mmm! Exquisite.

I'm sure he just went off to look for
a nice... mud hole to cool down in.

That's the Fairy Godmother's cottage.

She's the largest producer of hexes
and potions in the whole kingdom.

Tell Princess Fiona her husband,
Sir Shrek, is here to see her.

Hello, handsome.

949
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:49,370
Shrek!

950
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:52,810
- Princess!
- Donkey?

951
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,040
Wow! That potion
worked on you, too?

952
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,380
What potion?

953
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:59,650
Shrek and I took some magic potion.
And well...

954
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,950
Now, we're sexy!

955
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:04,320
Shrek?

956
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:05,380
[purrs]

957
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:11,160
For you, baby... I could be.

958
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:13,560
- Yeah, you wish.
- Donkey, where is Shrek?

959
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,970
He went inside looking for you.

960
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:18,830
Shrek?

961
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:22,400
Fiona! Fiona!

962
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:26,510
You want to dance, pretty boy?

963
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:33,010
Are you going so soon?
Don't you want to see your wife?

964
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,340
Fiona?

965
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:39,020
Shrek?

966
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:41,930
Aye, Fiona. It is me.

967
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,690
What happened to your voice?

968
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:47,900
The potion changed
a lot of things, Fiona.

969
00:58:47,970 --> 00:58:50,600
But not the way I feel about you.

970
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:52,140
Fiona?

971
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:55,910
- Charming?
- Do you think so?

972
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:59,810
[laughs] Dad. I was so hoping
you'd approve.

973
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:03,510
- Um... Who are you?
- Mom, it's me, Shrek.

974
00:59:03,590 --> 00:59:07,020
I know you never get a second chance
at a first impression,

975
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,590
but, well, what do you think?

976
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:16,520
[Shrek in distance] Fiona! Fiona!

977
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,860
Fiona!

978
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:23,930
- Fiona!
- Fiona, Fiona! Ho-ho-ho!

979
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:27,530
Oh, shoot! I don't think they
can hear us, pigeon.

980
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:29,130
[sighs deeply]

981
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:33,550
Don't you think you've already
messed her life up enough?

982
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,480
I just wanted her to be happy.

983
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:38,880
And now she can be.

984
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,940
Oh, sweetheart.

985
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:44,890
She's finally found
the prince of her dreams.

986
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,020
But look at me.
Look what I've done for her.

987
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:52,400
It's time you stop living
in a fairy tale, Shrek.

988
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:56,630
She's a princess,
and you're an ogre.

989
00:59:56,700 --> 01:00:00,730
That's something no amount
of potion will ever change.

990
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:09,980
But...

991
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:11,570
I love her.

992
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:14,490
If you really love her...

993
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,610
you will let her go.

994
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:17,760
[ Nick Cave: People Ain't No Good]

995
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,780
[ Nick Cave: People Ain't No Good]

996
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:22,550
Shrek?

997
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:23,720
Señor.

998
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,790
What's going on?
Where are you going?

999
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:37,440
You wouldn't have had anything to do
with this, would you, Harold?

1000
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:45,710
 People just ain't no good 

1001
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:51,890
 I think that's well understood 

1002
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,620
There you go, boys.

1003
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:55,660
Just leave the bottle, Doris.

1004
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:58,130
Hey. Why the long face?

1005
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:01,730
It was all just a stupid mistake.

1006
01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:06,500
I never should have rescued her
from that tower in the first place.

1007
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:10,610
I hate Mondays.

1008
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:14,340
I can't believe you'd walk away from
the best thing that happened to you.

1009
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,010
What choice do I have?

1010
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:19,540
She loves that pretty boy,
Prince Charming.

1011
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:21,710
Come on. Is he really
that good-looking?

1012
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:24,280
Are you kidding?
He's gorgeous!

1013
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:27,560
He has a face that looks like
it was carved by angels.

1014
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:30,220
- Oh. He sounds dreamy.
- You know...

1015
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:33,670
shockingly, this isn't
making me feel any better.

1016
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:40,430
Look, guys.
It's for the best.

1017
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:41,910
Mom and Dad approve,

1018
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:45,340
and Fiona gets the man
she's always dreamed of.

1019
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,280
Everybody wins.

1020
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:49,580
Except for you.

1021
01:01:49,650 --> 01:01:52,950
I don't get it, Shrek.
You love Fiona.

1022
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:54,390
Aye.

1023
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:57,950
And that's why
I have to let her go.

1024
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,820
Excuse me, is she here?

1025
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:04,060
She's, uh... in the back.

1026
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:07,130
Oh, hello again.

1027
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:13,500
Fairy Godmother. Charming.

1028
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:17,910
You'd better have a good reason
for dragging us down here, Harold.

1029
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:23,780
Well, I'm afraid Fiona isn't really...
warming up to Prince Charming.

1030
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:27,380
- FYI, not my fault.
- No, of course it's not, dear.

1031
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,320
I mean,
how charming can I be

1032
01:02:29,390 --> 01:02:31,790
when I have to pretend
I'm that dreadful ogre?

1033
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,920
No, no, it's nobody's fault.

1034
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,360
Perhaps it's best if we just
call the whole thing off, okay?

1035
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:41,770
- [both] What?
- You can't force someone to fall in love!

1036
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:45,030
I beg to differ.
I do it all the time!

1037
01:02:45,110 --> 01:02:49,540
Have Fiona drink this and she will fall in love
with the first man she kisses,

1038
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:51,580
which will be Charming.

1039
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:55,670
- Umm... no.
- What did you say?

1040
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:58,150
I can't. I won't do it.

1041
01:02:58,220 --> 01:02:59,810
Oh, yes, you will.

1042
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:03,480
If you remember, I helped you
with your happily ever after.

1043
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:07,120
And I can take it away
just as easily.

1044
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,430
Is that what you want? Is it?

1045
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,890
- No.
- Good boy.

1046
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:15,700
Now, we have to go.

1047
01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:18,030
I need to do Charming's hair
before the ball.

1048
01:03:18,110 --> 01:03:20,370
He's hopeless.
He's all high in the front.

1049
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:23,270
He can never get to the back.
You need someone to do the back.

1050
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:25,010
Oh. Thank you, Mother.

1051
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:26,910
[Donkey] Mother?

1052
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:30,140
Um... Mary! A talking horse!

1053
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:31,210
The ogre!

1054
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:37,110
Stop them! Thieves! Bandits!
Stop them!

1055
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,750
(Announcer) The abs are fab
and it's gluteus to the maximus

1056
01:03:41,830 --> 01:03:45,200
here at tonight's Far, Far Away
Royal Ball blowout!

1057
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:48,360
The coaches are lined up
as the cream of the crop pours out of them

1058
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,200
like Miss Muffet's curds and whey.

1059
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:52,240
Everyone who's anyone
has turned out

1060
01:03:52,310 --> 01:03:54,830
to honor Princess Fiona
and Prince Shrek.

1061
01:03:54,910 --> 01:03:57,940
And, oh my,
the outfits look gorgeous!

1062
01:03:58,010 --> 01:03:59,380
Look! Hansel and Gretel!

1063
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:02,080
What the heck are the crumbs for?

1064
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:05,210
And right behind them,
Tom Thumb and Thumbelina!

1065
01:04:05,290 --> 01:04:07,950
- Oh, aren't they adorable!
- [screaming]

1066
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:11,150
[woman] Here comes Sleeping Beauty!

1067
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:13,160
Tired old thing.

1068
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:16,800
Who's this? Who's this?
Who is this?

1069
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:20,030
Oh. It's the one, it's the only...

1070
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,700
It's the Fairy Godmother!

1071
01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:26,000
Hello, Far, Far Away!

1072
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:29,340
Can I get a whoop whoop?

1073
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:34,080
May all your endings be happy and...

1074
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:37,240
Well, you know the rest!

1075
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:40,310
We will be right back with the Royal
Far, Far Away Ball

1076
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:42,290
after these messages.

1077
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:43,980
I hate these ball shows.

1078
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:47,220
They bore me to tears.
Flip over to Wheel Of Torture!

1079
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:50,920
I'm not flipping anywhere, sir,
until I see Shrek and Fiona.

1080
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,660
Whizzes on you guys.

1081
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:55,860
Hey, mice, pass me a buffalo wing!

1082
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:58,170
No, to your left. Your left!

1083
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:04,410
- Tonight on "Knights"...
- Now here's a good show!

1084
