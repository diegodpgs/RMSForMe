34
00:02:53,929 --> 00:02:58,049
- How 'bout a souvenir picture?
- * Two in love can make it *

35
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,047
- Turn towards each other.

* For me and you **

40
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:50,188
My God! My phone just
does not work out here.

41
00:03:50,348 --> 00:03:52,510
Oh, my God!
How are we ever gonna live?

42
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,587
Uh! Thanks.

43
00:03:57,748 --> 00:03:59,506
There's a counsellor. Oh, excuse me.

44
00:03:59,665 --> 00:04:01,465
Um, can you tell me where
the Navajo bunk is?

45
00:04:01,624 --> 00:04:03,785
- It's right over there.
- Thanks.

46
00:04:07,463 --> 00:04:10,462
Now, girls, let's find our duffles
as quickly as we can.

47
00:04:10,622 --> 00:04:12,581
We have a big first day
ahead of us.

48
00:04:12,741 --> 00:04:15,099
I'm going to turn the bullhorn
over now to my daughter,

49
00:04:15,258 --> 00:04:17,740
and right-hand man,
Marva, Jr.

50
00:04:17,901 --> 00:04:21,898
Marva, bunk assignments,
if you please.

51
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:24,696
All right, ladies,
here we go. Listen up.

52
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:31,214
Wait a minute.
I thought this was a boy's camp.

53
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:40,770
Okay, found my duffle.

54
00:04:45,488 --> 00:04:49,328
Now the question is...
how do I get it out?

55
00:04:51,407 --> 00:04:54,525
Okay, I can do it.
Okay... no, I can't.

56
00:04:54,686 --> 00:04:56,964
- You must be new.
- How could you tell?

57
00:04:57,124 --> 00:04:59,205
You didn't know how to grab your duffle...

58
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,603
before the aides tossed
it into the heap.

59
00:05:01,764 --> 00:05:03,521
- I would say you need some serious help.
- Thanks.

60
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:05,642
It's the big, yellow one.

61
00:05:07,522 --> 00:05:09,799
Whoa! Now,
that's my kinda woman.

62
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:12,160
- Yo, tie-dye girl!
- Hmm?

63
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,678
Could you give me an hand
with my duffle? It's the yellow one,

64
00:05:14,838 --> 00:05:16,599
- buried way in there.
- Sure.

65
00:05:17,678 --> 00:05:19,436
Oh, that?
No problem.

66
00:05:20,836 --> 00:05:22,836
Hey, you're
from California?

67
00:05:22,997 --> 00:05:26,354
Do you, like, live in Hollywood?
Do you, like, live next door to a movie star?

68
00:05:26,514 --> 00:05:28,352
What are you two,
Lucy and Ethel?

69
00:05:28,512 --> 00:05:30,473
I've never even been
to Hollywood.

70
00:05:30,633 --> 00:05:33,670
I live in Napa. That's northern California.
And I live next door to a vineyard.

71
00:05:33,831 --> 00:05:35,591
- A what-yard?
- A vineyard.

72
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:37,950
It's where you grow grapes
to make wine.

73
00:05:38,109 --> 00:05:40,868
That's what we do.
Me and my dad, we own a vineyard.

74
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,509
- Parker, Hallie!
- Right here.

75
00:05:43,668 --> 00:05:45,746
- Arapaho.
- Same as me. That's where I am.

76
00:05:45,907 --> 00:05:49,985
Yes! Come on, you guys.

77
00:05:50,146 --> 00:05:53,664
So, ah, either of you, by any chance,
know how to play poker?

78
00:05:53,824 --> 00:05:55,944
- No.
- Never played it before.

79
00:05:56,104 --> 00:05:58,381
No? Gee,
what a shame.

80
00:05:58,542 --> 00:06:01,622
So, ah, how much cash did you guys
bring with you this summer?

81
00:06:01,781 --> 00:06:04,139
- How much?
- A lot.

82
00:06:04,299 --> 00:06:08,538
Whoa! Who is in there?

83
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:10,457
Come on. Let's go.

84
00:06:20,695 --> 00:06:22,852
Well, here we are.

85
00:06:23,012 --> 00:06:26,092
Camp Walden for Girls.

86
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,571
We travelled all the way
from London for this?

87
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:31,692
Well, it's rather picturesque.
Don't you think?

88
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,609
Eh, um--

89
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,890
Not exactly the term
I think I would have used.

90
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,807
- All right. Shall we review your mother's list?
- Mm-hmm.

91
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:41,767
- Now, let's see. Vitamins?
- Check.

92
00:06:41,927 --> 00:06:43,687
- Minerals?
- Check.

93
00:06:43,846 --> 00:06:47,204
- List of daily fruits and vegetables.
- Check. Check.

94
00:06:47,364 --> 00:06:49,404
Check for fruits,
check for vegetables. Go on.

95
00:06:49,563 --> 00:06:52,522
Sun block, lip balm,
insect repellant,

96
00:06:52,682 --> 00:06:56,201
stationery, stamps, photograph
of your mother, grandfather...

97
00:06:56,362 --> 00:06:58,520
and, of course,
your trusty butler, me.

98
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:01,119
- Got it all, I think.
- Oh, and, um--

99
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,239
Here's a little something
from your grandfather.

100
00:07:03,398 --> 00:07:05,477
A spanking-new deck
of cards.

101
00:07:05,637 --> 00:07:09,796
Maybe you'll actually find somebody on this
continent who can whip your tush at poker.

102
00:07:09,955 --> 00:07:11,715
Well, I doubt it.
But, thanks.

103
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,715
And thanks for
bringing me here, Martin.

104
00:07:18,754 --> 00:07:21,552
Now, you remember,
if you change your mind...

105
00:07:21,712 --> 00:07:25,232
and want me to come here and collect you at
the end of camp, I'm only a phone call away.

106
00:07:25,392 --> 00:07:27,750
Thanks,
but I'll be fine.

107
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:30,830
Really. See you in eight weeks,
Marty ol' pal.

108
00:07:30,989 --> 00:07:34,466
Missing you already,
queen of my heart.

109
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:52,420
- Have fun, old bean.
- I will.

110
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,737
- Toodle-oo.
- Toodle-oo.

111
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,617
Airport, please.

112
00:08:15,093 --> 00:08:18,450
* Such a feeling
coming over me *

113
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,411
Okay, hurry up.

114
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:24,728
* There is wonder
in the things I see *

115
00:08:27,648 --> 00:08:30,086
She brought a date.

116
00:08:30,246 --> 00:08:32,047
She didn't.

117
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:35,205
Mom! Mom! Are you there?
Pick up! Mom!

118
00:08:35,365 --> 00:08:38,285
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Slow down. Thank you.

119
00:08:38,444 --> 00:08:41,803
Have some too, okay?

120
00:08:41,962 --> 00:08:45,042
- It's something.
- It smells good.

121
00:08:45,202 --> 00:08:47,640
- I'll save ya a seat, Annie.
- Okay, thanks.

122
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,837
Excuse me, girls. I've just got to have
a scoop of these gorgeous strawberries.

123
00:08:54,998 --> 00:08:57,877
- Would you care for some, dear?
- Oh, no thanks. Can't. I'm-- I'm allergic.

124
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,436
Oh, that's too bad.
How 'bout you, dear? Strawberries?

125
00:09:00,595 --> 00:09:03,635
Oh, sorry, wish I could, but I can't.
I'm-I'm allergic.

126
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:05,554
Yes, allergic.

127
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:08,592
You just... told me that.
How did you get over there?

128
00:09:08,753 --> 00:09:12,710
Oh, well. First day of camp.
You'll have to excuse the old girl.

129
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:16,671
At least I'm not putting
salt in the sugar shakers.

130
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:21,787
Ah, well, I mean, you know.
Sugar in the salt shak--

131
00:09:21,948 --> 00:09:23,707
Now where did she go?

132
00:09:35,343 --> 00:09:37,421
Touche.

133
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,383
Good job.

134
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:41,700
All right!
Excellent, kid.

135
00:09:41,861 --> 00:09:44,541
The winner, and still undefeated
champ from Napa, California,

136
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:48,577
- Miss Hallie Parker.
- Yeah, Hallie.

137
00:09:48,738 --> 00:09:50,497
Do we have
any challengers?

138
00:09:53,216 --> 00:09:55,575
Oh, come on. Ladies,
let's not be damsels in distress here.

139
00:09:55,735 --> 00:09:57,576
I'll take
a whack at it.

140
00:09:57,735 --> 00:10:02,933
Okay. We've got ourselves
a chal-len-ger. Suit up.

141
00:10:03,093 --> 00:10:05,491
Cool.
Ooh, thanks.

142
00:10:12,609 --> 00:10:14,489
Here I go.

143
00:10:15,968 --> 00:10:18,246
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

144
00:10:18,406 --> 00:10:20,965
Go, Annie. Whoa!

145
00:10:21,086 --> 00:10:24,006
Fencers ready?

146
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:27,165
Ready. - All set.

147
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:30,243
En garde! Fence!

148
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,599
- Oops.
- Ah!

149
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,272
Touche!

150
00:10:57,953 --> 00:11:00,231
- Nice catch.
- Thanks.

151
00:11:07,508 --> 00:11:11,308
Touche!

152
00:11:11,468 --> 00:11:15,665
- Sorry, let me help you.
- No, let me help you!

153
00:11:15,824 --> 00:11:17,585
- What'd ya do that for?
- Me? You pushed me in.

154
00:11:17,746 --> 00:11:20,544
I did not.

155
00:11:20,704 --> 00:11:23,424
Okay, that was
quite a show.

156
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:27,181
All right. I think we've got ourselves
a new camp champ from London, England,

157
00:11:27,341 --> 00:11:30,621
Miss Annie James.

158
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,579
All right, girls.
Shake hands.

159
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,500
Come on, girls.

160
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:00,890
Oh, my!

161
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:04,207
Why's everyone
staring?

162
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:06,766
- Don't you see it?
- See what?

163
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:10,684
- The resemblance between us.
- Resemblance? Between you and me?

164
00:12:12,046 --> 00:12:13,844
Let me see.
Turn sideways.

165
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:18,204
Now the other way.

166
00:12:20,403 --> 00:12:24,122
Well, your eyes are
much closer together than mine.

167
00:12:24,282 --> 00:12:26,279
Your ears, well, don't worry,
you'll grow into them.

168
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,359
Your teeth are a little crooked.

169
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,878
Ah! And that nose! Well, don't worry,
dear, those things can be fixed.

170
00:12:34,237 --> 00:12:38,595
- Want me to deck her for ya?
- Hold on. I'm not quite finished yet.

171
00:12:38,756 --> 00:12:40,834
You wanna know
the real difference between us?

172
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:44,873
Let me see.
I know how to fence and you don't?

173
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:47,953
Or, I have class and you don't.
Take your pick.

174
00:12:48,113 --> 00:12:52,229
- Why, I oughta--
- Ladies, it's time to break up this little lovefest.

175
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:56,589
Annie, Hallie.
I mean, Hallie, Annie.

176
00:12:56,749 --> 00:12:58,708
I-I-I mean-- Whoa!

177
00:13:06,227 --> 00:13:10,423
Sorry, ladies. Two pair.
Read 'em and weep.

178
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,704
Aah! I'm out.

179
00:13:12,865 --> 00:13:16,062
- So that's it? No more takers?
- I have nothing left.

180
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,662
I'll take
a whack at it.

181
00:13:30,617 --> 00:13:32,376
Take a seat,
Parker.

182
00:13:36,694 --> 00:13:38,454
Deal me in.

183
00:13:41,012 --> 00:13:44,053
* Now, on the day
I was born *

184
00:13:44,212 --> 00:13:46,610
* The nurses all
gathered 'round *

185
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:49,171
* And they gazed
in a wide wonder *

186
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,089
* At the joy
they had found *

187
00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:53,168
* The head nurse spoke up *

188
00:13:53,328 --> 00:13:55,528
* Said leave this one alone *

189
00:13:55,687 --> 00:13:59,685
* She could tell right away
that I was bad to the bone *

190
00:13:59,846 --> 00:14:02,286
* Bad to the bone **

191
00:14:05,963 --> 00:14:09,002
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'll make you a little deal.

192
00:14:09,163 --> 00:14:12,441
Loser jumps into the lake
after the game.

193
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:16,120
- Excellent.
- Butt naked.

194
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:21,757
Even more excellent.
Start unzipping, Parker.

195
00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:24,758
Straight.
In diamonds.

196
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:27,636
You're good, James.

197
00:14:27,796 --> 00:14:30,433
But, you're
just not good enough.

198
00:14:31,674 --> 00:14:35,152
In your honour,
a royal flush.

199
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:39,711
- Love the birthday suit.
- Lookin' good.

200
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,630
Oww, baby!

201
00:14:56,265 --> 00:14:58,025
Grab her clothes.

202
00:15:05,021 --> 00:15:07,463
Oh, right. Fine.

203
00:15:07,623 --> 00:15:12,778
If that's the way you want it,
then let the games begin.

204
00:15:12,939 --> 00:15:18,297
I swear I heard your evil clone sneaking all
the way up toward the mess hall this morning.

205
00:15:18,456 --> 00:15:22,536
I am so tired. I'm going back
into bed and sleeping till lunch.

206
00:15:25,173 --> 00:15:27,535
That does not seem like
a possibility, babe.

207
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:30,531
- Why not?
- That's why not.

208
00:15:33,611 --> 00:15:35,570
No... way.

209
00:15:44,248 --> 00:15:46,406
Shh.

210
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:49,164
- Be quiet.
- Oh, I hope they're sleeping.

211
00:15:51,527 --> 00:15:53,724
The coast is clear.
Okay, let's go in.

212
00:15:56,363 --> 00:15:59,121
- Payback time.
- Don't wake her.

213
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:03,722
- Careful.
- Shh.

214
00:16:14,077 --> 00:16:17,755
Got milk?

215
00:16:57,461 --> 00:17:00,859
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

216
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,819
Oh, my God.

217
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,492
She didn't get me.

218
00:17:26,889 --> 00:17:31,088
Ah! That girl
is without a doubt...

219
00:17:31,248 --> 00:17:34,568
the lowest, most awful creature
that ever walked the planet!

220
00:17:34,727 --> 00:17:36,807
Thank you. Thank you very much.

221
00:17:39,806 --> 00:17:42,525
- Morning, girls.
- Morning, Marvas.

222
00:17:42,684 --> 00:17:45,282
Marvas!

223
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:47,842
Surprise inspection.

224
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:50,042
Attention!

225
00:17:51,481 --> 00:17:53,521
* Navajos **

226
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,918
No, no, Marva.
Do not go in there.

227
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:02,597
One of the girls got sick last night,
and it is a big, big mess.

228
00:18:02,756 --> 00:18:05,638
Save yourself the aggravation.
It's really disgusting.

229
00:18:05,797 --> 00:18:08,994
Oh, well, if someone's sick,
dear, then I must go in.

230
00:18:12,114 --> 00:18:15,232
- Move aside, dear.
- No, no, really. I insist.

231
00:18:15,392 --> 00:18:18,512
I can't let you go in there.
She's highly contagious.

232
00:18:18,671 --> 00:18:20,870
Honest.

233
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,430
Actually, we're all
quite fine in here,

234
00:18:23,589 --> 00:18:27,507
unless Hallie Parker knows
something we don't know.

235
00:18:27,668 --> 00:18:31,626
Really. I insist. Open the door
and come see for yourself, ma'am.

236
00:18:31,785 --> 00:18:33,985
Stand aside, Hallie.

237
00:18:38,103 --> 00:18:41,343
Whoa!

238
00:18:42,743 --> 00:18:45,060
Mommy!

239
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:52,497
No! No!

240
00:18:52,658 --> 00:18:55,418
No!

241
00:19:01,855 --> 00:19:06,534
- I told you it was a mess in here.
- She should know. She did it!

242
00:19:06,694 --> 00:19:08,492
You!
And you!

243
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,173
Pack your bags!

244
00:19:33,443 --> 00:19:36,203
Okay, girls.
The rest of you...

245
00:19:36,364 --> 00:19:38,641
back to your activities.

246
00:19:40,641 --> 00:19:45,039
You two...
the isolation cabin.

247
00:20:47,136 --> 00:20:51,176
Oh!

248
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:53,813
Oh, gosh,
it's stuck.

249
00:20:59,971 --> 00:21:03,051
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

250
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:08,409
Ah! Oh, man!

251
00:21:18,004 --> 00:21:22,804
- Oh, here's your--
- Cuppy.

252
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,401
Any of your
pictures ruined?

253
00:21:28,561 --> 00:21:32,201
- Only the beautiful Leo DiCaprio.
- Who?

254
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,200
You've never heard
of Leonardo DiCaprio?

255
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:37,117
How far away
is London anyway?

256
00:21:37,277 --> 00:21:39,437
Well, from here
it's 3,000 miles,

257
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:42,555
but sometimes
it seems much further.

258
00:21:42,714 --> 00:21:47,554
- How far away is your home?
- Oh, California is way at the other end of the country.

259
00:21:47,713 --> 00:21:50,754
Actually, here's a picture of my house.

260
00:21:50,914 --> 00:21:54,392
- Wow! It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

261
00:21:54,552 --> 00:21:57,271
We built it when I was little.
We've got this incredible porch...

262
00:21:57,431 --> 00:21:59,350
that looks over
the entire vineyard.

263
00:21:59,509 --> 00:22:01,950
- And then--
- Who-- Who's that?

264
00:22:02,109 --> 00:22:04,309
Oh, that's my dad. He didn't know
I was taking the picture then...

265
00:22:04,469 --> 00:22:06,227
or else he would have
turned around.

266
00:22:06,387 --> 00:22:09,907
He's kinda like my best friend.
We do everything together.

267
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:17,863
- What's the matter?
- Oh, it's chilly in here, that's all.

268
00:22:23,701 --> 00:22:26,462
- Want one?
- Oh, sure, I love Oreos.

269
00:22:26,621 --> 00:22:29,779
At home I eat them with--
I eat them with peanut butter.

270
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:34,177
You do?
That is so weird. So do l.

271
00:22:34,338 --> 00:22:37,575
You're kidding. Most people
find that totally disgusting.

272
00:22:37,735 --> 00:22:39,537
I know.
I don't get it.

273
00:22:39,697 --> 00:22:41,855
Me either.

274
00:22:45,254 --> 00:22:47,012
What's your
dad like?

275
00:22:47,173 --> 00:22:49,133
I mean, is he the kind of father
you can talk to,

276
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:51,892
or is he one of those workaholic types who says,
"I'll talk to ya later, honey,"

277
00:22:52,051 --> 00:22:53,810
but, you know,
never really does?

278
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,810
- I hate that.
- I don't have a father, actually.

279
00:22:56,969 --> 00:22:59,568
I mean, I had one once,
I suppose.

280
00:22:59,728 --> 00:23:02,205
But my parents
divorced years ago.

281
00:23:02,365 --> 00:23:04,447
My mother never even
mentions him.

282
00:23:04,607 --> 00:23:07,404
It's like he evaporated
into thin air or something.

283
00:23:07,565 --> 00:23:10,364
It's scary the way nobody
stays together any more.

284
00:23:10,525 --> 00:23:13,322
- Tell me about it.
- How old are you?

285
00:23:13,483 --> 00:23:16,522
I'll be 12 on October 11.

286
00:23:16,682 --> 00:23:19,800
- So will l.
- Your birthday's on October 11?

287
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,000
- Yeah.
- How weird is that?

288
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,599
Extremely.

289
00:23:24,758 --> 00:23:26,797
Oh, hey.
It stopped raining.

290
00:23:26,957 --> 00:23:30,358
You wanna go get
a Popsicle or something?

291
00:23:37,353 --> 00:23:40,953
- What's the matter?
- Hallie, what's your mother like?

292
00:23:41,112 --> 00:23:46,032
I never met her. She and my dad split
up when I was a baby, maybe even before.

293
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:48,950
I'm not sure.
He doesn't like to talk about her.

294
00:23:49,111 --> 00:23:51,510
But I know she was
really, really beautiful.

295
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,988
How do you know that?

296
00:23:54,148 --> 00:23:58,028
Well, because my dad had this old
picture of her hidden in his sock drawer,

297
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:01,865
and he caught me looking at it, like,
all the time, so he gave it to me to keep.

298
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:05,624
Look, I'm-I'm really thirsty. Sure you don't want
to go to the mess hall and get a lemonade?

299
00:24:05,785 --> 00:24:09,062
Will you stop thinking about
your stomach at a time like this?

300
00:24:09,221 --> 00:24:11,783
- At a time like what?
- Don't you realize what's happening?

301
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:15,539
I mean,
think about it.

302
00:24:15,698 --> 00:24:17,460
I only
have a mother,

303
00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:19,578
and you only have
a father.

304
00:24:19,738 --> 00:24:21,498
You've never seen
your mom,

305
00:24:21,657 --> 00:24:23,698
and I've never
seen my dad.

306
00:24:23,858 --> 00:24:26,096
You have one old picture
of your mom,

307
00:24:26,255 --> 00:24:28,577
and I have one old picture
of my dad.

308
00:24:28,736 --> 00:24:31,095
But at least yours
is probably a whole picture.

309
00:24:31,254 --> 00:24:33,133
Mine is a pathetic
little thing,

310
00:24:33,294 --> 00:24:35,413
all crinkled and ripped
right down the middle and--

311
00:24:35,573 --> 00:24:39,091
What are you rummaging
in your trunk for?

312
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,371
This.

313
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,290
It's a picture
of my mom,

314
00:24:43,451 --> 00:24:45,208
and it's
ripped too.

315
00:24:45,369 --> 00:24:47,609
Right down
the middle?

316
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,888
Right down
the middle.

317
00:25:06,323 --> 00:25:09,440
This is so...
freaky.

318
00:25:11,001 --> 00:25:12,760
Okay.

319
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:15,956
On the count of three,
we'll show them to each other, okay?

320
00:25:16,117 --> 00:25:18,238
Okay.

321
00:25:18,398 --> 00:25:20,396
One.

322
00:25:20,556 --> 00:25:22,917
Two.

323
00:25:23,076 --> 00:25:24,876
- Three.
- Three.

324
00:25:31,393 --> 00:25:34,671
- That's my dad.
- That's my mom.

325
00:25:36,751 --> 00:25:38,510
That's the lunch bell.

326
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:41,789
I'm not so
hungry any more.

327
00:25:42,949 --> 00:25:45,506
So if--
if your mom...

328
00:25:45,626 --> 00:25:47,787
is my mom...

329
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:50,545
and my dad
is your dad...

330
00:25:50,706 --> 00:25:54,384
and we're both born on October 11...

331
00:25:54,544 --> 00:25:56,303
then you and I
are like--

332
00:25:56,464 --> 00:25:58,262
Iike sisters.

333
00:25:58,421 --> 00:26:00,183
Sisters?

334
00:26:00,343 --> 00:26:03,101
Hallie, we're
like twins.

335
00:26:11,417 --> 00:26:13,777
I just don't know what to say.

336
00:26:13,937 --> 00:26:15,696
What's that
you're holding?

337
00:26:15,855 --> 00:26:18,416
My locket.
I got it when I was born.

338
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:20,574
It has an "H"
on it.

339
00:26:20,734 --> 00:26:23,652
I got mine when I was born, too,

340
00:26:23,814 --> 00:26:27,412
except mine has
an "A" on it.

341
00:26:27,572 --> 00:26:30,492
Ooh, now I've got goose bumps.

342
00:26:30,651 --> 00:26:33,050
My God, so I'm
not an only child.

343
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:36,129
I'm a twin.
I'm a twin-- there's two of me.

344
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:38,049
I mean,
two of us.

345
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,127
- This is like--
- Mind boggling.

346
00:26:40,286 --> 00:26:42,687
- Totally.
- Completely.

347
00:26:42,847 --> 00:26:45,924
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

348
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:53,801
Tell me, what's Mom like?

349
00:26:53,962 --> 00:26:57,642
Well, she designs wedding gowns.

350
00:26:57,801 --> 00:27:00,199
Really?

351
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:02,599
She's becoming
quite famous, actually.

352
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,757
A princess in Greece
just bought one of her gowns.

353
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,678
Wow.

354
00:27:07,837 --> 00:27:10,436
Y-You know what's
interesting?

355
00:27:10,594 --> 00:27:13,795
Neither one of our parents
ever got married again.

356
00:27:13,955 --> 00:27:16,074
Has Dad ever been close
to getting remarried?

357
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:20,672
Never. He always says
I'm the only girl in his life.

358
00:27:20,832 --> 00:27:22,752
Yeah, Mom's never
come close either.

359
00:27:29,828 --> 00:27:32,509
I have a brilliant,
beyond brilliant idea.

360
00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:34,987
I'm serious.
I am a total genius.

361
00:27:35,147 --> 00:27:37,348
You want to know
what Dad is like, right?

362
00:27:37,507 --> 00:27:39,265
Right.

363
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:41,344
And I'm dying
to know Mom.

364
00:27:41,505 --> 00:27:43,785
So what I'm thinking is--
Don't freak out, okay?

365
00:27:43,944 --> 00:27:46,543
I think we should switch places.

366
00:27:46,703 --> 00:27:49,462
When camp's over
I'll go back to London as you,

367
00:27:49,622 --> 00:27:51,503
and you go back
to California as me.

368
00:27:51,662 --> 00:27:55,819
- What?
- Annie, we can pull it off. We're twins, aren't we?

369
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,097
Hallie, we're totally
and completely 100 %/% different.

370
00:27:59,258 --> 00:28:01,658
So, what's the problem?
I'll teach you to be me...

371
00:28:01,818 --> 00:28:03,777
and you teach me
to be you.

372
00:28:03,937 --> 00:28:05,695
Look, I can
do you already.

373
00:28:05,854 --> 00:28:08,655
Yes, you want to know
the difference between us?

374
00:28:08,815 --> 00:28:10,734
I have class
and you don't.

375
00:28:10,893 --> 00:28:15,452
Come on, Ann. I got to meet my ma.

376
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:18,610
The truth is, you know,
if we switch,

377
00:28:18,771 --> 00:28:22,210
sooner or later
they'll have to unswitch us.

378
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:24,168
And when they do,
they'll have to meet again,

379
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:27,568
- face to face.
- After all these years.

380
00:28:27,728 --> 00:28:32,007
Thank you. I told you I'm brilliant.

381
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:35,165
Okay. 'Tis grandfather.

382
00:28:35,324 --> 00:28:38,405
- He's so cute. What do we call him?
- Grandfather.

383
00:28:38,564 --> 00:28:40,804
Why didn't I think of that?

384
00:28:40,963 --> 00:28:42,960
This is Martin,
he's our butler.

385
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,522
- We have a butler?
- Mm-hmm.

386
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,760
Okay. Living-room's first.
Then over here is the dining room.

387
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:50,880
But we never eat in there
except for Thanksgiving...

388
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:53,358
and Christmas and,
of course, October 11.

389
00:28:53,518 --> 00:28:57,478
* Believe in the magic
that can set you free *

390
00:28:57,637 --> 00:28:59,476
* Ahh-hh-hh *

391
00:28:59,635 --> 00:29:02,074
* Talkin' 'bout the magic *

392
00:29:02,236 --> 00:29:05,594
* Do you believe in magic *

393
00:29:05,753 --> 00:29:08,594
* Do you believe, believe *

394
00:29:08,753 --> 00:29:11,553
* Do you believe in magic **

395
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:17,030
Okay. I-I'm ready.

396
00:29:37,981 --> 00:29:40,662
- Don't shut your eyes!
- Oh. Okay. Right.

397
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:42,941
Sorry. Just got
a little nervous.

398
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,660
You're nervous?
An 11-year-old is cutting my hair.

399
00:29:45,781 --> 00:29:47,618
Hey, you sounded just like me.

400
00:29:47,778 --> 00:29:51,498
Well, I'm supposed to, aren't I?
Go on, just do it.

401
00:29:55,696 --> 00:29:57,496
Don't panic.
You look great.

402
00:30:07,651 --> 00:30:09,410
Looking good.

403
00:30:12,929 --> 00:30:17,008
This is so... scary.

404
00:30:17,168 --> 00:30:20,006
Honey, you never
looked better.

405
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:24,325
Oh, my God!

406
00:30:24,486 --> 00:30:26,244
What?

407
00:30:26,404 --> 00:30:28,163
I have
pierced ears.

408
00:30:28,324 --> 00:30:30,683
No. No, no and no.

409
00:30:30,843 --> 00:30:32,601
Not happening.
Sorry, wrong number.

410
00:30:32,761 --> 00:30:34,842
I won't.
I refuse.

411
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:36,761
Then cutting your hair
was a total waste,

412
00:30:36,921 --> 00:30:38,679
'cause, I mean, there's no way
I can go to camp...

413
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:40,600
with pierced ears
and come home without 'em.

414
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,719
I mean, come on.
Get real.

415
00:30:57,951 --> 00:30:59,714
Needle sterilized.

416
00:30:59,872 --> 00:31:01,911
Y-You-- You sure you know
what you're doing?

417
00:31:02,071 --> 00:31:05,311
Relax. I've gone with all my friends
to get their ears pierced.

418
00:31:05,471 --> 00:31:08,029
It's nothing.
Just close your eyes,

419
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:10,389
and it will be over
before you know it.

420
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:13,626
- Earring ready?
- Yes.

421
00:31:13,787 --> 00:31:15,546
Good.
Hand me the apple.

422
00:31:18,026 --> 00:31:19,785
Thank you.

423
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:22,624
Just relax. I'm telling you,
this is not a big deal.

424
00:31:22,784 --> 00:31:25,463
On the count of three,
remove the ice.

425
00:31:25,622 --> 00:31:28,701
One... two...

426
00:31:28,862 --> 00:31:30,902
three.

427
00:31:45,135 --> 00:31:47,335
Girls, time to say
your last goodbyes.

428
00:31:47,496 --> 00:31:49,934
- The busses are loading.
- Busses one and two leaving.

429
00:31:50,095 --> 00:31:52,812
I'll see you guys next summer, I promise.

430
00:31:52,973 --> 00:31:55,652
Okay, so call me every single day.

431
00:31:55,812 --> 00:31:57,570
All right. And write me.
Don't forget.

432
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:00,051
I won't.

433
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:02,409
Okay. This is it.

434
00:32:02,569 --> 00:32:05,449
So remember, you're going
to find out how Mom and Dad met.

435
00:32:05,609 --> 00:32:08,246
- And you're going to find out why they broke up.
- Annie James,

436
00:32:08,407 --> 00:32:10,965
- your car is here.
- That's you.

437
00:32:11,085 --> 00:32:13,965
Here's your ticket and passport.
Martin will pick you up at the airport tomorrow morning.

438
00:32:14,124 --> 00:32:18,284
- What time do you leave?
- Oh, not for a couple of hours. Give Mom a kiss for me.

439
00:32:18,444 --> 00:32:21,522
- Give Dad one for me.
- Annie James, front and centre.

440
00:32:21,681 --> 00:32:23,441
Bye.

441
00:32:23,602 --> 00:32:26,320
- Bye.
- Last call, Annie James.

442
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:32,718
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

443
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,676
Good luck.

444
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:57,748
Okay. This is it.

445
00:32:57,908 --> 00:33:00,669
God, I hope
she likes me.

446
00:33:00,829 --> 00:33:02,867
Please like me.

447
00:33:03,026 --> 00:33:04,786
Please.

448
00:33:34,535 --> 00:33:38,374
- Annie!
- Martin.

449
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:44,572
- Missed you.
- Missed you.

450
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:48,049
- What have you done to your hair?
- Cut it. Do you like it?

451
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:51,170
Love it. It's the new you.

452
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:53,088
And you've had
your ears pierced.

453
00:33:53,247 --> 00:33:55,088
Give me five,
girlfriend.

454
00:34:10,162 --> 00:34:14,043
* There she goes *

455
00:34:14,201 --> 00:34:18,478
* There she goes again *

456
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,118
* Racing through my brain *

457
00:34:22,277 --> 00:34:25,557
* And I just can't contain *

458
00:34:25,718 --> 00:34:29,196
* This feeling
that she makes *

459
00:34:38,633 --> 00:34:41,790
* There she goes *

460
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:44,830
* There she goes again *

461
00:34:44,991 --> 00:34:49,147
* She calls my name **

462
00:35:24,015 --> 00:35:26,615
- Home again.
- Thank you.

463
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:32,051
This is it.
7 Primbrook Lane.

464
00:35:59,163 --> 00:36:01,761
Hello.

465
00:36:28,832 --> 00:36:31,190
Grandfather?

466
00:36:33,631 --> 00:36:37,468
- I'm home.
- Is that my little girl?

467
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:40,188
That tall, gangly thing?

468
00:36:40,308 --> 00:36:42,587
Yes, it's me.

469
00:36:42,747 --> 00:36:47,025
Oh, welcome home.

470
00:36:47,185 --> 00:36:50,103
- Did you have a good time, sweet pea?
- Uh-huh, great.

471
00:36:50,262 --> 00:36:52,184
What are you doing?

472
00:36:52,345 --> 00:36:54,103
- Just smelling.
- Smelling?

473
00:36:54,262 --> 00:36:56,141
- I'm making a memory.
- Oh.

474
00:36:56,301 --> 00:36:58,221
Years from now,
when I'm all grown up,

475
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,459
I'll always remember
my grandfather...

476
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:02,659
and how he
always smelt of...

477
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,739
peppermint
and pipe tobacco.

478
00:37:04,899 --> 00:37:06,657
Good to have you back.

479
00:37:06,816 --> 00:37:08,576
Annie?

480
00:37:13,255 --> 00:37:15,732
Annie?

481
00:37:16,895 --> 00:37:19,052
- Mother.
- You're back.

482
00:37:35,327 --> 00:37:38,525
- I can't believe it's you.
- And I can't believe it's you.

483
00:37:38,686 --> 00:37:41,966
And with short hair.
Who cut it for you?

484
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:44,923
A girl I met at camp.
Do you hate it?

485
00:37:45,082 --> 00:37:47,563
No, I absolutely
love it.

486
00:37:47,722 --> 00:37:50,760
You got your ears pierced?

487
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,082
Well, are there any other surprises?

488
00:37:53,242 --> 00:37:56,119
Belly button rings,
tattoos?

489
00:37:56,279 --> 00:37:58,560
Ah, darling,
what is it?

490
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:01,277
I'm sorry.
It's just--

491
00:38:01,397 --> 00:38:03,635
I've missed you
so much.

492
00:38:03,796 --> 00:38:05,916
Oh.

493
00:38:06,077 --> 00:38:07,835
I know.

494
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:11,394
- It seems like it's been forever.
- You have no idea.

495
00:38:18,032 --> 00:38:21,630
So, come on. Tell me,
did you like everyone? Was it fun?

496
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:26,028
- Ah, Martin.
- I found a stowaway in your suitcase.

497
00:38:26,187 --> 00:38:27,947
Oh, my God. Cuppy!

498
00:38:28,108 --> 00:38:30,347
- Cuppy?
- He-- He belongs to my friend,

499
00:38:30,507 --> 00:38:32,706
the one I was, umm,
telling you about.

500
00:38:32,865 --> 00:38:34,985
I can't imagine
how he got into my suitcase.

501
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,543
Well, since he's not our Cuppy, shall
we dispose of the little creature?

502
00:38:38,703 --> 00:38:43,302
No! I mean, no.
I'll-- I'll mail him to her.

503
00:38:43,463 --> 00:38:45,861
She loves this thing a lot--
a lot, a lot.

504
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,981
And she's, like,
slept with this thing her entire life,

505
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:51,938
And she could never be, like--
Stay in a foreign country without him.

506
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:54,818
No, no. I'll take care of it.

507
00:38:54,978 --> 00:38:57,896
That will be all, Martin.
Thank you.

508
00:38:58,055 --> 00:39:00,257
Hello.

509
00:39:00,417 --> 00:39:03,135
Oh, hi.
How's the photo shoot going?

510
00:39:07,293 --> 00:39:11,091
Hmm. Well, can't you
manage without me?

511
00:39:11,251 --> 00:39:13,491
I mean, Annie just
got home from camp.

512
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,889
Hmm. Yeah.

513
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:27,485
* Here comes the sun
Do-dum-do-do *

514
00:39:27,646 --> 00:39:29,443
* Here comes the sun *

515
00:39:29,604 --> 00:39:32,285
* And I say
it's all right *

516
00:39:36,484 --> 00:39:41,240
- * Little darlin', it's been a long, cold lonely winter *
- Okay. Hold on a moment.

517
00:39:41,401 --> 00:39:45,438
Annie, would you hate very much
running down to the studio with me?

518
00:39:45,598 --> 00:39:48,400
- * It seems like years *
- No, I'd love it.

519
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:50,838
* Since it's been here *

520
00:39:50,998 --> 00:39:54,637
* Here comes the sun
Do-dum-do-do *

521
00:39:54,797 --> 00:39:56,556
* Here comes the sun *

522
00:39:56,715 --> 00:40:00,395
* And I say it's all right *

523
00:40:07,272 --> 00:40:09,030
* Little darlin' *

524
00:40:09,191 --> 00:40:11,429
* That smile's returning *

525
00:40:11,589 --> 00:40:13,948
* To their faces *

526
00:40:14,109 --> 00:40:17,827
* Little darlin'
It seems like years *

527
00:40:17,986 --> 00:40:21,346
* Since it's been here *

528
00:40:21,507 --> 00:40:24,503
* Here comes the sun
Do-dum-do-do *

529
00:40:24,664 --> 00:40:28,543
- Wow. That's incredible. You designed that?
- * Here comes the sun and I say *

530
00:40:28,704 --> 00:40:31,424
- * It's all right **
- Well, I had to do something while you were at camp.

531
00:40:31,583 --> 00:40:35,141
- You don't think it's too--
- No, it's gorgeous. I love it.

532
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,501
You know who would look
really beautiful in that gown?

533
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,098
- I mean, like, really beautiful?
- Who?

534
00:40:41,259 --> 00:40:43,099
- You.
- Me?

535
00:40:43,258 --> 00:40:45,857
You know what? I think that time
change has made you a little loopy.

536
00:40:46,018 --> 00:40:48,216
Come on. Let's see
what all the fuss is about.

537
00:40:48,376 --> 00:40:50,135
Okay. I'm here.

538
00:40:50,296 --> 00:40:52,056
Ah, we're saved.

539
00:40:52,214 --> 00:40:55,215
- Hi, Angela.
- Hi. Sorry, we don't know what to do with the veil.

540
00:40:55,374 --> 00:40:57,413
If she wears it, it covers the back
of the dress, and if she doesn't,

541
00:40:57,573 --> 00:40:59,571
- the dress looks--
- lncomplete, you're right.

542
00:40:59,731 --> 00:41:02,451
Can you try turning sideways
with your chin up?

543
00:41:02,612 --> 00:41:05,529
Yeah, I see the problem.
Can I have the veil? Annie, darling,

544
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:08,888
pass me one of those hats
on display in the window.

545
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,809
- Me?
- Yes.

546
00:41:12,207 --> 00:41:15,487
* Somebody like you *

547
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:18,005
- Which one do you like?
- The white one.

548
00:41:18,164 --> 00:41:20,566
- Me too.
- * Do you know I'll never let you *

549
00:41:20,726 --> 00:41:22,523
- * Go *
- Try this.

550
00:41:22,684 --> 00:41:25,964
Now, throw the veil
straight back.

551
00:41:26,123 --> 00:41:28,201
That's it. Now spin around.
I want to see the back of the dress.

552
00:41:28,362 --> 00:41:31,320
That's beautiful. Did you get that?
Just how it falls. Just down there.

553
00:41:31,479 --> 00:41:34,638
Don't worry about the bouquet.
You're married now. You've got to learn to juggle.

554
00:41:34,799 --> 00:41:40,277
- Don't forget you look happy. It is your wedding day.
- My mom is too cool.

555
00:41:40,438 --> 00:41:43,794
- * I'll never let you go *
- * Never, never gonna let you go *

556
00:41:43,957 --> 00:41:47,955
* I'll never let you go *

557
00:41:48,114 --> 00:41:50,595
* I'll never let you go *

558
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,869
* Never let you go *

559
00:42:02,029 --> 00:42:04,870
* I'll never let you go **

560
00:42:05,029 --> 00:42:08,349
So, doesn't designing all these
wedding gowns ever make you think about...

561
00:42:08,508 --> 00:42:11,386
getting married again, or at least
make you think about the "F" word.

562
00:42:11,546 --> 00:42:13,304
The "F" word?

563
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:16,784
- My father.
- Oh! Oh, that "F" word.

564
00:42:16,944 --> 00:42:18,703
Well, no, actually,

565
00:42:18,862 --> 00:42:22,142
because I didn't even wear a wedding
gown when I married the "F" word.

566
00:42:22,303 --> 00:42:25,340
- You didn't? Why not?
- Why the sudden curiosity...

567
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,261
about your dad,
huh?

568
00:42:27,421 --> 00:42:29,180
Well, maybe because
he's never mentioned.

569
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:31,178
And you can't blame
a kid for wondering.

570
00:42:31,337 --> 00:42:33,099
Mother, you can't avoid
the subject forever.

571
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,017
At least tell me
what he was like.

572
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:38,135
Okay. He was quite lovely,
to tell you the truth.

573
00:42:38,294 --> 00:42:41,655
When we met he was...
actually, entirely lovely.

574
00:42:41,814 --> 00:42:43,574
- All right?
- All right.

575
00:42:43,732 --> 00:42:45,494
So, did you meet
him here in London?

576
00:42:45,655 --> 00:42:47,852
- We met on the Q.E. 2.
- Q.E. what?

577
00:42:48,012 --> 00:42:51,692
The Queen Elizabeth 2.
It's an ocean liner that sails from London to New York,

578
00:42:51,852 --> 00:42:54,650
'cause I wasn't keen on flying then
and neither was your father.

579
00:42:54,811 --> 00:42:58,689
We met our first night on board ship.
We were seated next to each other at dinner.

580
00:42:58,849 --> 00:43:00,688
- He's an American, you know.
- No kidding?

581
00:43:00,848 --> 00:43:03,887
So, was it love at first sight?

582
00:43:04,046 --> 00:43:08,604
I knew you were going to ask me
all these questions one day. Taxi!

583
00:43:08,764 --> 00:43:10,725
Dear ol' Dad.

584
00:43:10,885 --> 00:43:13,842
I wonder what he's doing
at this very moment.

585
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:25,000
Thanks.

586
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:29,918
- Got it?
- Oh, gosh.

587
00:43:30,077 --> 00:43:31,835
It's him.

588
00:43:31,996 --> 00:43:34,397
Hey, Hal!

589
00:43:34,557 --> 00:43:36,315
Welcome home,
kiddo.

590
00:43:41,113 --> 00:43:42,872
Get into these arms,
you little punk.

591
00:43:43,032 --> 00:43:45,270
Dad. Finally.

592
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:55,827
Oh, I hope you had a lousy time at that
camp, because you are not going back.

593
00:43:55,988 --> 00:43:58,707
I missed you too much.

594
00:43:58,867 --> 00:44:00,786
What happened
to you, Hal?

595
00:44:00,945 --> 00:44:02,704
Something's changed.

596
00:44:02,865 --> 00:44:05,146
Are you
getting taller?

597
00:44:07,543 --> 00:44:09,343
So, what's up,
Dad?

598
00:44:09,503 --> 00:44:11,502
I mean, how's Chessy
and everybody?

599
00:44:11,662 --> 00:44:14,861
Great. Everybody's great.
Can't wait to see you.

600
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,821
Eight weeks really
is too long, Hal.

601
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,578
- A lot's been happening around here.
- A lot's happened to me too, Dad.

602
00:44:20,738 --> 00:44:23,657
I mean, I feel like
I'm practically a new woman.

603
00:44:25,737 --> 00:44:27,975
What's the matter?
I cut myself shaving?

604
00:44:28,135 --> 00:44:32,133
No, it's just-- just seeing you
for the first time.

605
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:35,454
I mean, you know,
in so long.

606
00:44:35,613 --> 00:44:38,212
You look taller to me, too, Dad.

607
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:40,450
Come on, squirt.
Let's get home.

608
00:44:54,847 --> 00:44:57,005
Oh, by the way,
thanks for all those newsy letters.

609
00:44:57,165 --> 00:44:59,805
I'm really glad I bought you
that personalized stationery...

610
00:44:59,965 --> 00:45:01,724
you just had
to have.

611
00:45:01,883 --> 00:45:04,321
- Well, we meant to write, Dad, but we just got so--
- We?

612
00:45:04,482 --> 00:45:06,243
Oh!
Oh, me and my friend.

613
00:45:06,402 --> 00:45:08,961
I-I met this girl at camp
and we got really close.

614
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:12,280
- Great.
- Practically like sisters.

615
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,678
- She was a lovely girl.
- Lovely girl?

616
00:45:14,839 --> 00:45:16,836
All of sudden
you're so proper?

617
00:45:16,997 --> 00:45:20,316
You're still biting those nails, I see.

618
00:45:20,477 --> 00:45:22,754
- Dad, you noticed.
- What do you mean noticed?

619
00:45:22,914 --> 00:45:24,676
You've been biting
them since you could chew.

620
00:45:24,836 --> 00:45:28,354
But I've decided to stop, Dad.
It's a horrid habit.

621
00:45:28,513 --> 00:45:30,353
Lovely girl, horrid habit.

622
00:45:30,514 --> 00:45:33,431
What did I do, send you
to summer camp or finishing school?

623
00:45:33,592 --> 00:45:36,351
And why do you keep saying "Dad"
at the end of every sentence?

624
00:45:36,511 --> 00:45:39,230
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
I was doing it, Dad.

625
00:45:40,628 --> 00:45:43,189
Sorry, Dad.

626
00:45:43,309 --> 00:45:46,186
Do you want to know
why I keep saying "dad"?

627
00:45:46,346 --> 00:45:49,786
- The truth?
- Because you missed your old man so much, right?

628
00:45:49,946 --> 00:45:54,665
Exactly. It's because
in my whole life,

629
00:45:54,825 --> 00:45:57,143
I mean, you know,
for the past eight weeks,

630
00:45:57,303 --> 00:46:01,102
I was never able to say the word "dad."
Never. Not once.

631
00:46:01,262 --> 00:46:03,501
And if you ask me,
I mean,

632
00:46:03,662 --> 00:46:06,700
a dad is an irreplaceable
person in a girl's life.

633
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:10,777
Think about it. There's a whole day
devoted to celebrating fathers.

634
00:46:10,937 --> 00:46:13,499
Just imagine someone's life
without a father--

635
00:46:13,658 --> 00:46:17,534
never buying a Father's Day card,
never sitting on their father's lap,

636
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:23,174
never being able to say, "Hi, Dad" or "What's up,
Dad" or "Catch you later, Dad."

637
00:46:23,334 --> 00:46:26,812
I mean, a baby's first words
are always "dada," aren't they?

638
00:46:26,971 --> 00:46:30,249
Let me see if I get this--
You miss being able to call me dad?

639
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:33,890
Yeah.
I really have, Dad.

640
00:46:39,767 --> 00:46:42,006
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

641
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:44,806
Now you're starting to sound
like your old self.

642
00:47:07,639 --> 00:47:10,317
Hello, gorgeous!

643
00:47:10,476 --> 00:47:12,394
Oh, look at you!

644
00:47:12,555 --> 00:47:14,954
Oh, you grew.

645
00:47:15,115 --> 00:47:18,552
Oh, we missed you
so much.

646
00:47:18,713 --> 00:47:21,672
Hey, don't you dare let your old man talk
you out of going back to camp. Okay?

647
00:47:21,831 --> 00:47:23,592
You're a growing girl.
You need adventure.

648
00:47:23,751 --> 00:47:26,671
- Okay.
- Oh, you hungry?

649
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:28,589
I made corn bread
and chili.

650
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:31,108
- Why are you so quiet? What's wrong?
- Nothing, it's just--

651
00:47:31,267 --> 00:47:33,190
I'm so happy
to be home.

652
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:35,947
Hey, did I hear somethin' about
corn bread and chili?

653
00:47:36,106 --> 00:47:38,667
Yeah, it's on
the stove. So...

654
00:47:38,787 --> 00:47:40,984
something's changed
about you, Hal.

655
00:47:41,145 --> 00:47:43,263
Umm, I can't
put my finger on it,

656
00:47:43,424 --> 00:47:47,303
- but something about you is definitely changed.
- Really?

657
00:47:47,463 --> 00:47:51,182
Well, it's just
the same old me. Honest.

658
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:56,100
Hi, Sammy.

659
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:01,457
What is wrong with you,
you goofball? It's Hallie.

660
00:48:01,616 --> 00:48:05,576
Oh, I-I probably just smell
like camp, that's all.

661
00:48:05,735 --> 00:48:07,495
What's the matter
with you?

662
00:48:07,655 --> 00:48:11,732
It's like you didn't even recognize her.

663
00:48:15,012 --> 00:48:18,371
Wow!
It's even better than the pictures.

664
00:48:19,929 --> 00:48:23,250
Okay, kiddo.
What do ya wanna do first, huh?

665
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:28,728
You wanna eat and then unpack?
Or, uh, we could unpack and then eat.

666
00:48:28,887 --> 00:48:33,087
- Or we could eat while we unpack.
- Do you mean I can eat in my room?

667
00:48:33,247 --> 00:48:35,964
Yeah, I'd say it's
a definite possibility.

668
00:48:36,125 --> 00:48:39,644
Hey, Hal, when you're done, come on down.
There's someone I want you to meet.

669
00:48:39,805 --> 00:48:42,842
- Okay, Dad.
- Okay, Hal.

670
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,279
Look at you. Always eating.

671
00:48:50,438 --> 00:48:52,121
- Did you tell her?
- No.

672
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,077
Nicky.

673
00:48:54,238 --> 00:48:56,638
- I will. I will.
- Tell me what?

674
00:48:56,798 --> 00:49:00,675
Hal, it is none of my business how your
father makes a fool out of himself. Okay?

675
00:49:00,835 --> 00:49:02,916
He's a big boy.
He can do what he wants.

676
00:49:03,076 --> 00:49:05,274
Okay. Okay.
So, who is she?

677
00:49:07,912 --> 00:49:09,672
Her name's
Meredith Blake.

678
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:12,151
She's a publicist
from San Francisco.

679
00:49:12,312 --> 00:49:14,071
Your father hired her
at the beginning of the summer...

680
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:16,310
to do some publicity
for the vineyard.

681
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:20,308
If you ask me, she's doin' a better job
of sellin' herself than the grapes.

682
00:49:20,467 --> 00:49:23,028
What do you mean?

683
00:49:23,148 --> 00:49:24,906
Oy.

684
00:49:25,066 --> 00:49:27,227
Look, you and I both know
your father's...

685
00:49:27,388 --> 00:49:29,866
not some kind of suave, debonair
bachelor-of-the-month type.

686
00:49:30,025 --> 00:49:32,144
So, I gotta ask myself, "What does
a hot, young thing like that...

687
00:49:32,304 --> 00:49:35,304
see in a guy who walks around
with his shirttail hangin' out...

688
00:49:35,463 --> 00:49:38,221
and his cereal bowl
full of chili?"

689
00:49:38,381 --> 00:49:41,140
Then, I realized there's about a million
reasons why that girl's gigglin'.

690
00:49:43,979 --> 00:49:46,700
And all of them are sitting at
the Napa Valley Community Bank.

691
00:49:46,861 --> 00:49:49,698
You mean, you don't think
she even really likes him?

692
00:49:49,857 --> 00:49:51,699
Eh, what do I know?
But I'll tell you one thing.

693
00:49:51,858 --> 00:49:54,016
This one's got your father
eating out of the palm of her hand.

694
00:49:54,176 --> 00:49:56,335
They do everything together.
They ride together.

695
00:49:56,496 --> 00:49:59,775
They swim together.
They go out to eat dinner every night.

696
00:49:59,933 --> 00:50:03,853
But, you know what? Meet her. See for
yourself. Don't let me influence you.

697
00:50:04,013 --> 00:50:05,892
There's my girl.

698
00:50:06,053 --> 00:50:11,371
Honey, I want you to meet
a friend of mine. Hal,

699
00:50:11,531 --> 00:50:12,889
this is Meredith Blake.

700
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:18,328
Hi.

701
00:50:20,286 --> 00:50:22,847
Hi,
Meredith Blake.

702
00:50:23,006 --> 00:50:26,125
Wow. I can't believe I'm finally
meeting the famous Hallie.

703
00:50:26,284 --> 00:50:29,123
I have looked forward
to this all summer.

704
00:50:29,284 --> 00:50:31,044
Really?
Well, here I am.

705
00:50:31,203 --> 00:50:33,241
Oh, Nicky,
she's adorable!

706
00:50:33,401 --> 00:50:35,761
You know, the way your father
talked about you,

707
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,799
I expected to meet a little girl,
but you are so grown up.

708
00:50:38,959 --> 00:50:42,319
I'll be 12 soon. How old are you?

709
00:50:42,479 --> 00:50:45,076
Twenty-six.

710
00:50:45,236 --> 00:50:47,638
Only 15 years older than me.
How old are you, again, Dad?

711
00:50:47,796 --> 00:50:49,556
Wow! Suddenly, you're
so interested in math.

712
00:50:49,716 --> 00:50:51,994
Look, I'm gonna go inside.
I'm gonna get some more chili,

713
00:50:52,154 --> 00:50:54,993
maybe a bottle of champagne
to celebrate.

714
00:50:55,154 --> 00:50:59,154
- What are we celebrating?
- Your homecoming, of course.

715
00:50:59,313 --> 00:51:02,471
Be right back.

716
00:51:02,631 --> 00:51:05,030
Meredith Blake.

717
00:51:05,191 --> 00:51:08,429
Hello, Reverend Mosby.

718
00:51:08,589 --> 00:51:13,028
Mm-hmm. Of course. No, I understand
it's for a local charity?

719
00:51:13,187 --> 00:51:15,666
Oh, yes.
I am writing it all down.

720
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:18,946
Okay, it sounds
very worthwhile, I agree.

721
00:51:19,105 --> 00:51:20,904
But, unfortunately,
I see that Mr Parker...

722
00:51:21,064 --> 00:51:23,145
is going to be
out of the country on those days.

723
00:51:23,304 --> 00:51:26,862
Yes. Absolutely.
I will be sure to mention it to him.

724
00:51:27,022 --> 00:51:28,781
Thank you.

725
00:51:28,943 --> 00:51:32,740
So, how was camp, Hal?
Was it fabulous?

726
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:35,820
My dad's going
out of the country?

727
00:51:35,979 --> 00:51:39,657
Oh, no. I just had to tell a little
white lie to get him out of something.

728
00:51:39,816 --> 00:51:43,296
You know, I have never heard a man
talk about his daughter...

729
00:51:43,457 --> 00:51:45,855
the way Nicky
talks about you.

730
00:51:46,015 --> 00:51:48,136
You two are obviously
incredibly close.

731
00:51:48,294 --> 00:51:50,373
Well, you know,
we're closer than close.

732
00:51:50,535 --> 00:51:52,292
We're all
each other has.

733
00:51:53,853 --> 00:51:57,172
Ohh!

734
00:51:57,331 --> 00:51:59,491
Sorry. Did I
get you wet, Mer?

735
00:51:59,651 --> 00:52:01,929
Just a little, Hal.

736
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:05,047
Mm.

737
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:06,968
Hey.
Guess what?

738
00:52:07,129 --> 00:52:11,446
Your daddy took me riding the other day,
and he let me ride your horse.

739
00:52:11,607 --> 00:52:13,566
I hope that's okay
with you.

740
00:52:13,724 --> 00:52:18,084
Oh, sure. She's probably used
to strange women riding her.

741
00:52:18,244 --> 00:52:20,802
Not that you're
strange or anything.

742
00:52:20,922 --> 00:52:24,081
Actually, compared to the others,
you are relatively normal.

743
00:52:24,242 --> 00:52:26,640
Others?
What others?

744
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,837
- Do you want the 411?
- What's the 411?

745
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,399
The information--
the lowdown on other women.

746
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,316
Can't say
I blame you.

747
00:52:34,477 --> 00:52:37,837
I'd wanna know if I was number 28--
I mean, 29 in a man's life.

748
00:52:37,997 --> 00:52:40,475
I'm number 29?

749
00:52:40,635 --> 00:52:42,316
Yeah. It's always
the same routine--

750
00:52:42,475 --> 00:52:44,354
horseback riding
through the vineyards,

751
00:52:44,514 --> 00:52:47,433
romantic dinners with
his special reserved-label wine,

752
00:52:47,592 --> 00:52:49,832
- moonlight swims--
- Here we go--

753
00:52:49,993 --> 00:52:53,389
a bottle of my special
reserve-label.

754
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:56,230
So, did you girls find something
to talk about while I was gone?

755
00:52:57,709 --> 00:53:01,390
- Does that mean yes?
- It sure does.

756
00:53:01,548 --> 00:53:05,185
Will somebody grab that, please?

757
00:53:07,946 --> 00:53:10,585
James residence.
Annie?

758
00:53:10,744 --> 00:53:13,184
- Yes, Martin.
- Oh, dear. It sounds just like you on the phone.

759
00:53:13,344 --> 00:53:16,182
I'm sorry.
To whom did you wish to speak?

760
00:53:16,343 --> 00:53:18,499
Annie?
Of course.

761
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:20,541
One moment, please.

762
00:53:20,701 --> 00:53:22,900
A Mildred Plotker
for you.

763
00:53:23,059 --> 00:53:24,820
Sounds just like
your twin.

764
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,820
My twin?
Very funny.

765
00:53:26,978 --> 00:53:28,856
Good one, Martin.
Hello.

766
00:53:29,017 --> 00:53:32,217
Oh, Mildred, darling.
Hi. How are you?

767
00:53:32,377 --> 00:53:35,375
- Hey, how's it going over there?
- Oh, everything's quite lovely here.

768
00:53:35,536 --> 00:53:37,295
W-We're expecting
a bit of rain today.

769
00:53:37,455 --> 00:53:39,613
But, Mildred, can you--
can you hold on for a moment?

770
00:53:39,774 --> 00:53:42,772
Okay, but hurry, Hal.
I've got to talk to you.

771
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:49,450
Okay. Now I can talk. Oh, my God! Mom's incredible.

772
00:53:49,611 --> 00:53:52,330
I cannot believe I lived
my entire life without knowing her.

773
00:53:52,488 --> 00:53:54,247
Sh-She's beautiful
and fun...

774
00:53:54,407 --> 00:53:57,768
- and smart, and I love the gowns she designs.
- But--

775
00:53:57,927 --> 00:54:00,526
And I got her talking about how she
and Dad first met. And, if you ask me,

776
00:54:00,685 --> 00:54:03,605
- there's like a whole possibility, like--
- Hallie, stop!

777
00:54:03,765 --> 00:54:06,243
We've got a major problem. You're going to
have to bring Mother out here immediately.

778
00:54:06,403 --> 00:54:09,523
Immediately? Are you nuts?
I've only had one day with her.

779
00:54:09,683 --> 00:54:11,442
I'm just getting to know her.
I can't. I won't.

780
00:54:11,601 --> 00:54:14,602
But this is an emergency!
Dad's in love.

781
00:54:14,761 --> 00:54:16,961
Get out of here!
Dad doesn't fall in love.

782
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,918
I mean,
at least not seriously.

783
00:54:19,078 --> 00:54:21,239
Trust me.
He's serious about this one.

784
00:54:21,398 --> 00:54:23,837
He's always holding her hand
and kissing her neck...

785
00:54:23,997 --> 00:54:25,758
and waiting on her
hand and foot.

786
00:54:25,918 --> 00:54:28,155
- He is?
- It's disgusting.

787
00:54:28,316 --> 00:54:31,074
Well, you'll just have to break 'em up.
Sabotage her. Do whatever you have to.

788
00:54:31,233 --> 00:54:33,953
I'm trying, but, I mean,
I'm at a slight disadvantage.

789
00:54:34,113 --> 00:54:36,752
I only met the man
12 hours ago.

790
00:54:36,913 --> 00:54:39,112
Hal, you've got to get
back here to help me.

791
00:54:39,273 --> 00:54:42,071
Annie, I can't.
I want more time with Mom.

792
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:44,311
What's going on?

793
00:54:44,471 --> 00:54:46,588
Ann, are you still there?
I can barely hear you. Ann.

794
00:54:46,749 --> 00:54:49,229
- I'm here. What do you--
- Operator. Operator.

795
00:54:49,388 --> 00:54:51,668
- I think I lost you, Ann.
- Hello?

796
00:54:51,827 --> 00:54:55,305
Thanks for all the help, Hal.

797
00:54:55,466 --> 00:54:58,105
Hm.

798
00:54:58,264 --> 00:55:01,903
Hi. I had a phone call
from a friend at camp.

799
00:55:02,062 --> 00:55:04,064
Yeah. I-It's
an old camp tradition.

800
00:55:04,223 --> 00:55:08,140
Talk to your friend from inside a closet.
Kinda stupid, I know, but--

801
00:55:08,302 --> 00:55:13,818
So, breakfast anyone?

802
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:17,857
Okay. Here we go.
Most important meal of the day.

803
00:55:18,018 --> 00:55:20,978
Eggs sunny-side up,
bacon, side of toast...

804
00:55:21,137 --> 00:55:22,895
and, in case you're
really hungry,

805
00:55:23,056 --> 00:55:25,614
a stack of humongous chocolate chip
pancakes, which smell incredible,

806
00:55:25,774 --> 00:55:29,734
- if I do say so myself.
- Thanks, Chessy.

807
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:31,972
You're not hungry again?

808
00:55:32,131 --> 00:55:33,813
You hardly touched your chili,
your favourite food in the world.

809
00:55:33,973 --> 00:55:36,210
And now you don't want breakfast?
Are you sick, honey?

810
00:55:36,371 --> 00:55:38,209
I'm fine.
I promise.

811
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:40,130
Where's Dad?

812
00:55:40,291 --> 00:55:42,688
Oh. He and Miss "I'll Just Have
Half A Grapefruit, Thank You"...

813
00:55:42,848 --> 00:55:44,687
Ieft about
an hour ago.

814
00:55:44,847 --> 00:55:47,206
You overslept,
and he didn't want to wake you.

815
00:55:47,367 --> 00:55:49,446
Of course, I'd probably oversleep, too,
if I were up until midnight...

816
00:55:49,606 --> 00:55:51,726
making mysterious phone calls
from my bathroom.

817
00:55:51,886 --> 00:55:54,644
Um. Oh. Oh. That.

818
00:55:54,804 --> 00:55:56,642
I was calling a friend
from camp, Mildred.

819
00:55:56,802 --> 00:55:59,244
She lives
in New York.

820
00:55:59,403 --> 00:56:02,160
Oh, I see. So, you wanted
to wait and call Mildred...

821
00:56:02,321 --> 00:56:05,241
at a time that was convenient for her
because of the time difference.

822
00:56:05,401 --> 00:56:07,718
Exactly. Because--
Because of the time difference.

823
00:56:07,879 --> 00:56:11,239
Uh-huh. So, you waited until it was
3:00 in the morning her time?

824
00:56:11,398 --> 00:56:14,397
- That makes perfect sense.
- Actually--

825
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:17,396
It was 7:00 at night
her time.

826
00:56:17,556 --> 00:56:19,315
You see, she lives in New York,
but she was on vacation...

827
00:56:19,474 --> 00:56:21,233
with her family
in Bora Bora.

828
00:56:23,514 --> 00:56:27,833
- Mm-hmm.
- Very smooth.

829
00:56:27,992 --> 00:56:30,391
Okay, look, smarty pants,
your father wants you...

830
00:56:30,552 --> 00:56:32,469
to meet him at his office as soon
as you're done with breakfast.

831
00:56:32,629 --> 00:56:35,030
He does?
Thanks.

832
00:56:35,189 --> 00:56:37,109
I'm done.

833
00:56:41,267 --> 00:56:43,026
That dog
has gotten so weird.

834
00:56:43,186 --> 00:56:45,744
Bye, Chessy. Thanks again
for breakfast. It was great.

835
00:56:48,345 --> 00:56:51,143
Push, Hal.

836
00:56:51,302 --> 00:56:54,862
Sorry. I... forgot.

837
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:02,699
Honey, I'm really glad
you're here,

838
00:57:02,858 --> 00:57:05,579
'cause there's something really
important I want to talk to you about.

839
00:57:05,738 --> 00:57:09,577
That's funny, because there's something really
important that I want to talk to you about.

840
00:57:09,736 --> 00:57:12,056
- Yeah? Well, you go first.
- No, you.

841
00:57:12,216 --> 00:57:16,455
Okay. I want to talk to you
about Meredith.

842
00:57:16,614 --> 00:57:19,692
And I want to talk to you
about my mother.

843
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:23,413
- What about Meredith?
- Well, what about your mother?

844
00:57:23,572 --> 00:57:25,531
Dad, I'm almost 12.
How long do you expect me...

845
00:57:25,691 --> 00:57:28,452
to buy that story that the stork
dropped me on your doorstep?

846
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:31,649
Oh, come on, Hal.
We've talked about your mother.

847
00:57:31,809 --> 00:57:33,767
No, we haven't.
Not really.

848
00:57:33,927 --> 00:57:37,167
A girl needs more in life than
a half a crumpled old photograph.

849
00:57:37,326 --> 00:57:39,085
Dad, I'm almost
a teenager.

850
00:57:39,246 --> 00:57:41,087
Face it.
I need a mother.

851
00:57:41,246 --> 00:57:43,285
You know what?
You're right.

852
00:57:43,445 --> 00:57:47,644
You're absolutely right. You do need
a mother. Which brings me to--

853
00:57:50,242 --> 00:57:52,800
- Meredith.
- Hi. Hello, Hal.

854
00:57:52,922 --> 00:57:54,680
Hi.

855
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,759
Hallie, this is
my assistant, Richard.

856
00:57:56,919 --> 00:57:59,520
Richard, this is Nick's daughter, the
one I've been telling you so much about.

857
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:02,357
- Oh, hello. How are you?
- Hi there.

858
00:58:02,517 --> 00:58:04,756
- Did you tell her?
- Almost.

859
00:58:04,915 --> 00:58:06,836
Hey, if you're free later,

860
00:58:06,996 --> 00:58:08,755
why don't we all
have lunch on the terrace?

861
00:58:08,915 --> 00:58:12,274
Well, actually, I promised Hal
we'd hang out together this afternoon.

862
00:58:12,434 --> 00:58:14,872
Oh, no problem.
I've got plenty to do.

863
00:58:15,032 --> 00:58:18,672
I'm working on a new label design,
Nicky, featuring Y-O-U.

864
00:58:18,832 --> 00:58:21,389
You're gonna love it.
See you for dinner, darling.

865
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:24,750
- Bye, Hal.
- Bye.

866
00:58:24,909 --> 00:58:27,028
The first change I make is to send
that two-faced little brat...

867
00:58:27,187 --> 00:58:29,187
off to boarding-school
in Timbuktu.

868
00:58:29,347 --> 00:58:31,147
Ooh. Ice Woman!

869
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:33,305
And proud of it, babe.

870
00:58:40,062 --> 00:58:42,783
Come on, Dad.

871
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:48,701
Okay. Okay. You win.

872
00:58:48,861 --> 00:58:51,259
Pull up.
Give that horse a rest.

873
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:53,658
Whoa, Sprout.

874
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:57,298
So, honey, are you excited about our camping trip?

875
00:58:57,458 --> 00:58:59,416
- What camping trip?
- What camping trip?

876
00:58:59,575 --> 00:59:01,336
The one
we take every summer...

877
00:59:01,495 --> 00:59:03,495
before you go back
to school.

878
00:59:03,655 --> 00:59:07,814
Oh. Oh. That camping trip.
Yeah. Sure. I can't wait.

879
00:59:07,973 --> 00:59:11,411
So, uh, Hal.

880
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:13,333
What do you think
of Meredith?

881
00:59:13,492 --> 00:59:16,210
As what, Dad?

882
00:59:16,369 --> 00:59:19,490
Your-- Your publicist,
your friend, your--

883
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:22,807
No. Just what do you think
of her as a person?

884
00:59:22,968 --> 00:59:24,688
Oh. She's cute.

885
00:59:24,848 --> 00:59:26,606
She has nice hair,
good teeth.

886
00:59:26,766 --> 00:59:28,565
She can spell
the word "you."

887
00:59:28,726 --> 00:59:31,605
Honestly, Dad, the woman is
a complete stranger to me.

888
00:59:31,765 --> 00:59:33,644
Why do you
want my opinion, anyway?

889
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:35,603
Well, I'll tell
you why, Hal.

890
00:59:35,762 --> 00:59:38,643
- Because, believe it or not--
- Race you back to the ranch, Dad.

891
00:59:38,802 --> 00:59:41,120
H-Hal.

892
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,960
Hal, I'm trying
to tell you something.

893
00:59:47,279 --> 00:59:49,678
Hey!
Slow down.

894
01:00:13,111 --> 01:00:15,468
I'm in so over my head, here.
I-I can't handle this.

895
01:00:15,628 --> 01:00:17,588
I-I just can't.
I'm only one kid.

896
01:00:17,747 --> 01:00:20,787
- You got something you want
to share with the class, there, Hal?

897
01:00:20,947 --> 01:00:23,505
Chessy, you--
you gave me a fright.

898
01:00:25,143 --> 01:00:27,145
I gave you
a fright?

899
01:00:27,304 --> 01:00:31,624
You scared me. I didn't know
you were like-- Iike in here.

900
01:00:31,784 --> 01:00:34,901
Are you sure there isn't anything
you want to talk to me about?

901
01:00:36,701 --> 01:00:40,499
Like, why Sammy never comes
near you any more.

902
01:00:40,658 --> 01:00:44,578
Or why your
appetite's changed.

903
01:00:44,738 --> 01:00:47,377
Or why, all of a sudden,
you're neat as a pin...

904
01:00:47,537 --> 01:00:51,736
and using expressions like,
"You gave me a fright."

905
01:00:51,895 --> 01:00:55,775
Chessy, l... changed a lot
over the summer, that's all.

906
01:00:55,934 --> 01:00:58,813
Okay.

907
01:00:58,972 --> 01:01:02,133
Boy, if I didn't know any better,
I'd say it's almost like you were--

908
01:01:04,451 --> 01:01:06,530
Forget it.
It's impossible.

909
01:01:06,689 --> 01:01:09,049
Almost as if
I were who, Chessy?

910
01:01:09,209 --> 01:01:11,769
Nobody. Nobody.
Forget I mentioned it.

911
01:01:11,888 --> 01:01:15,006
Almost as if
I were... Annie?

912
01:01:23,403 --> 01:01:25,162
You know
about Annie?

913
01:01:25,322 --> 01:01:27,922
I am Annie.

914
01:01:28,082 --> 01:01:30,680
- Oh.
- Hal.

915
01:01:30,841 --> 01:01:34,359
Hal, why did you take off
on me like that?

916
01:01:34,519 --> 01:01:37,518
I told you I wanted
to talk to you about something.

917
01:01:39,598 --> 01:01:41,877
Chessy, why are you
looking at her like that?

918
01:01:42,036 --> 01:01:44,234
Like what?

919
01:01:44,397 --> 01:01:46,156
I'm not looking at her any special way.

920
01:01:46,317 --> 01:01:49,074
I'm looking at her like
I've looked at her for 11 years.

921
01:01:49,233 --> 01:01:51,834
Since the day she came home
from the hospital--

922
01:01:51,995 --> 01:01:54,791
Six pounds, 11 ounces,
21 inches long--

923
01:01:54,952 --> 01:01:57,512
This is how
I look at her.

924
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:01,150
Can I hug her?

925
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:04,188
Oh, she's so beautiful...

926
01:02:04,349 --> 01:02:06,948
and so big.

927
01:02:07,107 --> 01:02:09,867
I'm gonna make you
something special to eat.

928
01:02:10,027 --> 01:02:11,906
What would you like?
Anything? You know what?

929
01:02:12,067 --> 01:02:15,226
It doesn't matter. I'm just gonna
go whip up everything we've got.

930
01:02:15,385 --> 01:02:17,144
Okay?
Okay.

931
01:02:17,305 --> 01:02:21,903
Hal, come here.
Now, we have to talk.

932
01:02:22,062 --> 01:02:24,382
- Okay. Shoot.
- Okay.

933
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:26,620
Honey,

934
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:31,140
I wanna know what you think
about making Meredith...

935
01:02:31,299 --> 01:02:33,057
part of the family.

936
01:02:33,219 --> 01:02:37,177
- Part of our family?
- Yeah.

937
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:40,857
- I think it's an awesome idea. Inspired.
- Yeah? You do?

938
01:02:41,015 --> 01:02:43,574
- Brilliant. Really?
- Really? You do?

939
01:02:43,734 --> 01:02:47,253
Totally. I mean, like it's a dream come
true. I've always wanted a big sister.

940
01:02:47,413 --> 01:02:50,530
Oh.

941
01:02:50,691 --> 01:02:53,172
Um. Honey, I think
you're kinda missin' the point.

942
01:02:53,331 --> 01:02:56,529
No, I'm not.
You're going to adopt Meredith.

943
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:58,809
That is so sweet, Dad.

944
01:02:58,969 --> 01:03:01,407
No, I'm not going
to adopt her.

945
01:03:01,568 --> 01:03:05,647
I'm... going
to marry her.

946
01:03:05,808 --> 01:03:07,565
Marry her!
That's insane!

947
01:03:07,725 --> 01:03:10,445
How can you marry a woman
young enough to be my big sister?

948
01:03:10,606 --> 01:03:15,723
Hal. Hal. Hal, calm down.

949
01:03:15,884 --> 01:03:17,642
Hal.

950
01:03:17,803 --> 01:03:21,000
Are you speaking French?

951
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:23,200
I-I learned it
at camp.

952
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:25,918
Okay.
I'm-I'm sorry.

953
01:03:26,078 --> 01:03:30,157
Let-Let's discuss this calmly--
calmly and rationally.

954
01:03:30,317 --> 01:03:33,795
- Yeah, and in English, if you don't mind. All right?
- Okay.

955
01:03:33,955 --> 01:03:36,915
Sweetheart, what
has gotten into you?

956
01:03:37,075 --> 01:03:39,433
Nothing. Nothing.
Just-- Just--

957
01:03:39,592 --> 01:03:41,355
Dad, you can't
get married.

958
01:03:41,513 --> 01:03:43,272
It'll totally ruin
completely everything.

959
01:03:43,433 --> 01:03:47,432
Hal. Hal.

960
01:03:47,592 --> 01:03:49,949
Hallie.

961
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:52,669
Don't look at me.
I don't know a thing.

962
01:04:06,905 --> 01:04:10,943
She thought I was going to adopt her?

963
01:04:11,103 --> 01:04:14,740
- Hi, doll.
- Hi.

964
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:16,658
Oh, you look
stressed, baby.

965
01:04:20,378 --> 01:04:22,138
- How about a martini?
- How about a double?

966
01:04:22,298 --> 01:04:25,778
Coming right up.

967
01:04:25,937 --> 01:04:28,937
Chessy.

968
01:04:29,096 --> 01:04:32,175
Don't you love it? It's just what
we need. It's such a big house.

969
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:34,212
Chessy!

970
01:04:36,813 --> 01:04:38,572
You rang?

971
01:04:38,732 --> 01:04:42,411
Two martinis, please.
And make Mr Parker's a double.

972
01:04:44,369 --> 01:04:47,529
Chess, please.
I'm getting a migraine.

973
01:04:47,690 --> 01:04:50,568
Mm-hmm.

974
01:04:50,728 --> 01:04:52,486
I told Hallie.

975
01:04:52,645 --> 01:04:54,407
You did?
And?

976
01:04:54,567 --> 01:04:56,965
She went ballistic.
She started yelling in French.

977
01:04:57,125 --> 01:04:58,884
I didn't even know
she spoke French.

978
01:04:59,043 --> 01:05:00,805
I don't know what's
gotten into her.

979
01:05:00,965 --> 01:05:04,321
Oh, Nicky. This reaction
is totally classic.

980
01:05:04,481 --> 01:05:07,283
It's "Daddy's Getting
Remarried 101."

981
01:05:07,442 --> 01:05:10,241
I'd be worried if
she didn't act this way.

982
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,120
Look. Why don't I
go talk to her?

983
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,039
You know,
woman to woman.

984
01:05:15,199 --> 01:05:18,638
I-I think she's a little sensitive
about you right now.

985
01:05:18,797 --> 01:05:21,196
That's why
I need to do it.

986
01:05:21,357 --> 01:05:23,434
We've got to break
the ice sometime.

987
01:05:23,594 --> 01:05:26,235
Wear your shirt
like this.

988
01:05:26,395 --> 01:05:29,113
I like it when I can see
a little chest hair.

989
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:40,149
Hm.

990
01:05:43,348 --> 01:05:45,987
Knock, knock.
Can I join you?

991
01:05:46,147 --> 01:05:48,066
Sure.

992
01:05:52,744 --> 01:05:54,506
Guess the news
of the engagement...

993
01:05:54,666 --> 01:05:56,824
- came as a bit of a shock, huh?
- Basically.

994
01:05:56,983 --> 01:06:00,343
You know, I remember
what it was like to be 11.

995
01:06:00,504 --> 01:06:03,541
I had my first beau at 11.
It's a wonderful age.

996
01:06:03,701 --> 01:06:05,979
You're just starting to feel
like a woman,

997
01:06:06,139 --> 01:06:08,899
and, believe it or not,
soon, you'll understand...

998
01:06:09,058 --> 01:06:10,818
what it's like
to be in love.

999
01:06:10,979 --> 01:06:12,738
Me?
I don't think so.

1000
01:06:12,898 --> 01:06:15,017
I don't even have
my 12-year-old molars yet.

1001
01:06:15,177 --> 01:06:17,096
Oh, well.
Take it from someone...

1002
01:06:17,255 --> 01:06:19,976
who got their molars
very early in life,

1003
01:06:20,136 --> 01:06:22,493
being in love is
a fantastic mystery...

1004
01:06:22,654 --> 01:06:24,652
that takes a man
and a woman--

1005
01:06:24,815 --> 01:06:28,451
I don't mean to be jerky when you're
trying to be all mushy and everything,

1006
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:30,530
but I know what mystery
my dad sees in you.

1007
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:32,771
You do?

1008
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:34,889
You're young and beautiful
and sexy.

1009
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:36,808
And, hey.
The guy's only human.

1010
01:06:36,969 --> 01:06:38,728
But, if you ask me,
marriage is supposed to be...

1011
01:06:38,889 --> 01:06:40,727
based on something more
than just sex, right?

1012
01:06:40,887 --> 01:06:42,646
Boy.

1013
01:06:42,806 --> 01:06:45,166
Your father
underestimates you.

1014
01:06:45,327 --> 01:06:49,044
But you won't,
will you, Meredith?

1015
01:06:49,206 --> 01:06:51,803
Being young and beautiful
is not a crime, you know.

1016
01:06:51,964 --> 01:06:55,484
And for your 411,
I adore your father.

1017
01:06:55,643 --> 01:06:58,641
He's exactly the kind of man
I always planned on marrying.

1018
01:06:58,801 --> 01:07:00,759
This is
the real deal, honey,

1019
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:03,359
and nothing you do is going
to come between us.

1020
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:05,279
Hate to break
it to you, angel,

1021
01:07:05,437 --> 01:07:08,118
but you are no longer
the only girl in Nick Parker's life.

1022
01:07:08,278 --> 01:07:11,157
- Get over it.
- If this is the real deal,

1023
01:07:11,316 --> 01:07:13,074
then my dad's money...

1024
01:07:13,234 --> 01:07:16,275
has nothing to do with you
wanting to marry him, right?

1025
01:07:16,434 --> 01:07:19,675
Okay, puss. You listen,
and you listen good.

1026
01:07:19,834 --> 01:07:23,152
I am marrying your father in two weeks,
whether you like it or not.

1027
01:07:23,311 --> 01:07:25,390
So I suggest you do not tangle
with me any more.

1028
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:29,429
You are in way over your head.
Is that clear?

1029
01:07:31,067 --> 01:07:32,908
Crystal.

1030
01:07:38,227 --> 01:07:41,705
Martin, a refill, please.

1031
01:07:41,864 --> 01:07:44,145
You must have grown
three inches, I swear,

1032
01:07:44,305 --> 01:07:47,302
in six weeks.

1033
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:50,223
- Lovely choice of wine, by the way, Martin.
- Thank you, sir.

1034
01:07:50,382 --> 01:07:52,461
May I have a sip?

1035
01:07:52,621 --> 01:07:55,299
I don't think
you're gonna like it.

1036
01:08:05,216 --> 01:08:09,255
Well, if you ask me, the bouquet is
a little too robust for a Merlot,

1037
01:08:09,415 --> 01:08:12,852
but, then again, I'm partial to
the softer California grape.

1038
01:08:15,613 --> 01:08:18,611
She learned about wine
at this summer camp?

1039
01:08:18,771 --> 01:08:20,572
She must have.

1040
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:28,728
Darling, are you all right?

1041
01:08:28,889 --> 01:08:30,647
I had one sip too many,
I guess.

1042
01:08:30,807 --> 01:08:33,368
You know, Mother, I feel like
I could use a bit of fresh air.

1043
01:08:33,527 --> 01:08:36,365
W-Would it be okay if
I stepped outside for a moment?

1044
01:08:36,525 --> 01:08:38,284
Are-Are you okay?
Would you like me to go with you?

1045
01:08:38,443 --> 01:08:41,483
Oh, no, no, no. I'll be fine.
Just got a touch woozy, that's all.

1046
01:08:44,241 --> 01:08:46,002
Woozy, huh?

1047
01:09:05,954 --> 01:09:09,953
Um, yes, I'd like to place
a collect call to America, please.

1048
01:09:11,753 --> 01:09:14,591
Hello.

1049
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:17,230
- What's up?
- Hal, I'm desperate.

1050
01:09:17,389 --> 01:09:20,348
- Dad's getting married.
- What do you mean, getting married?

1051
01:09:20,508 --> 01:09:23,229
I mean black tie, white gown--
the whole enchilada.

1052
01:09:23,388 --> 01:09:25,506
- What?
- The wedding's in two weeks.

1053
01:09:25,666 --> 01:09:28,387
So, if there's any hope of getting
Mom and Dad back together,

1054
01:09:28,548 --> 01:09:31,105
we've got to do it fast,
and I mean really fast.

1055
01:09:31,265 --> 01:09:34,145
Okay. So, Mom and I are going out
to the theatre tonight.

1056
01:09:34,304 --> 01:09:36,743
I'll-I'll drop the bomb on her
first thing in the morning.

1057
01:09:36,902 --> 01:09:38,741
Okay. Thanks.

1058
01:09:38,902 --> 01:09:41,621
- And, Hallie, hurry!
- Okay, I will.

1059
01:09:43,701 --> 01:09:45,498
Oh, excuse me, sir.

1060
01:09:45,659 --> 01:09:48,939
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh. Yes.

1061
01:09:49,098 --> 01:09:51,696
Now, what say you and I
take a little stroll...

1062
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:53,697
in the park,
eh, young lady?

1063
01:09:53,858 --> 01:09:57,015
- Okay.
- Um. Now--

1064
01:09:57,174 --> 01:10:02,133
- Come on. What's this all about?
- Well, it's a long story.

1065
01:10:02,293 --> 01:10:05,372
Well, it's a very big park, and we've
got plenty of time, you know.

1066
01:10:05,533 --> 01:10:07,291
Well, first of all--

1067
01:10:23,407 --> 01:10:26,923
Just do it, sweet pea.

1068
01:10:34,602 --> 01:10:36,921
Darling, come in.
I just have to finish this sketch...

1069
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,839
and FedEx it
off to Paris.

1070
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,760
And then, how about you and I
go out to lunch...

1071
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:43,079
and spend the rest of the day
getting lost in Harrod's, huh?

1072
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:44,998
I can't, Mother.

1073
01:10:45,156 --> 01:10:47,358
Sorry. I-I have to go
out of town today.

1074
01:10:47,518 --> 01:10:49,516
Oh, you have
to go out of town?

1075
01:10:49,676 --> 01:10:53,276
And where, may I ask,
are you going?

1076
01:10:53,436 --> 01:10:56,994
- Annie. Annie.
- That's where I have to go.

1077
01:10:57,153 --> 01:11:01,471
- I have to go see Annie.
- I see. And where might Annie be?

1078
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:05,152
In Napa with her father,
Nick Parker.

1079
01:11:12,829 --> 01:11:14,787
You're not Annie?

1080
01:11:14,946 --> 01:11:17,146
That would be correct.

1081
01:11:17,307 --> 01:11:19,666
You're Hallie?

1082
01:11:22,265 --> 01:11:24,024
I am.

1083
01:11:24,184 --> 01:11:26,422
Annie and I
met at the camp,

1084
01:11:26,581 --> 01:11:30,782
and-and we decided
to switch places.

1085
01:11:30,941 --> 01:11:33,819
I'm sorry,
but I've never seen you,

1086
01:11:33,979 --> 01:11:36,579
and-and I dreamt of meeting you
my whole life.

1087
01:11:36,739 --> 01:11:39,977
And Annie felt the exact
same way about Dad, so--

1088
01:11:40,136 --> 01:11:42,417
so, we sorta
just switched lives.

1089
01:11:42,577 --> 01:11:44,816
I hope you're
not mad,

1090
01:11:44,976 --> 01:11:47,255
because I love you so much,
and I just hope that one day...

1091
01:11:47,414 --> 01:11:50,414
you could love me as me
and not as Annie.

1092
01:11:52,012 --> 01:11:54,574
Oh, darling.

1093
01:11:54,693 --> 01:11:57,092
I've loved you
your whole life.

1094
01:12:04,727 --> 01:12:09,167
I've never been so happy
in my entire life.

1095
01:12:13,286 --> 01:12:16,565
So, l-- I guess you have
to switch us back now, huh?

1096
01:12:18,924 --> 01:12:21,723
Well, technically,
you belong to your dad,

1097
01:12:21,882 --> 01:12:24,642
and Annie belongs to me.

1098
01:12:24,802 --> 01:12:26,801
His-and-hers kids.

1099
01:12:26,961 --> 01:12:30,118
No offence, Mom,
but this arrangement really sucks.

1100
01:12:30,277 --> 01:12:32,200
I agree,
it totally sucks.

1101
01:12:32,359 --> 01:12:34,597
Then, I say we fly to Napa,
see Annie and Dad...

1102
01:12:34,756 --> 01:12:37,757
and work this
whole thing out.

1103
01:12:37,917 --> 01:12:39,875
And I say
you're right.

1104
01:12:40,035 --> 01:12:41,995
Not to worry, darling.
I'll take care of everything.

1105
01:12:42,154 --> 01:12:44,954
You're not to worry.
Okay?

1106
01:12:48,312 --> 01:12:50,752
I'm sorry.
I can't handle this.

1107
01:12:50,911 --> 01:12:53,829
I mean, I haven't seen or heard
from Nick Parker in over 11 years,

1108
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:56,071
and suddenly I'm flying
halfway across the world to--

1109
01:12:56,230 --> 01:12:59,028
I'm not mature enough for this.

1110
01:12:59,187 --> 01:13:02,268
If the man didn't make me so nuts,
I'd still be married to him.

1111
01:13:03,986 --> 01:13:06,546
I mean, we came up with this arrangement so
that we'd never have to see each other again.

1112
01:13:06,705 --> 01:13:08,825
I mean, look at me, Martin.
Have you ever seen me like this?

1113
01:13:08,985 --> 01:13:10,743
- We-- I--
- Don't answer that.

1114
01:13:10,904 --> 01:13:14,064
I mean, what if he doesn't
recognize me?

1115
01:13:14,224 --> 01:13:16,502
No, don't answer that,
either.

1116
01:13:16,663 --> 01:13:19,461
So, Hallie said
he was a-- a hunk?

1117
01:13:19,622 --> 01:13:21,940
He was rather dishy.

1118
01:13:22,101 --> 01:13:24,978
He had a smile that made me go weak
at the knees, if you can imagine that.

1119
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:29,537
- Okay, I'm all set, Mom.
- Great. Me too. Almost.

1120
01:13:29,697 --> 01:13:32,458
Mom, your-your suitcase
is like totally empty.

1121
01:13:32,617 --> 01:13:34,375
Oh, right.
Sorry.

1122
01:13:34,536 --> 01:13:37,415
Um, did you speak
to your father, dear?

1123
01:13:37,575 --> 01:13:39,335
Um, yeah. Yeah.
I just hung up with him, actually.

1124
01:13:39,494 --> 01:13:41,294
He said he's really anxious
to see you.

1125
01:13:41,453 --> 01:13:44,772
Anxious-nervous, like he's totally,
completely dreading it?

1126
01:13:44,932 --> 01:13:49,612
- Or anxious-excited, like he's looking forward to it?
- Anxious-excited, definitely.

1127
01:13:49,770 --> 01:13:52,130
- Oh.
- He said he'll meet us tomorrow at noon...

1128
01:13:52,289 --> 01:13:54,247
at the Stafford Hotel
in San Francisco.

1129
01:13:54,408 --> 01:13:56,608
My, my, my.
That's incredibly soon. Isn't it?

1130
01:13:56,768 --> 01:14:00,325
Well, um, why don't you run downstairs
and-- and gather up our tickets...

1131
01:14:00,486 --> 01:14:03,045
- from your grandfather while I finish up here.
- Okay.

1132
01:14:03,165 --> 01:14:06,404
Liar, liar.
Pants on fire.

1133
01:14:06,563 --> 01:14:09,123
- Shh!
- Oh, Martin. I have a really ridiculous,

1134
01:14:09,243 --> 01:14:11,083
somewhat childish request
to make.

1135
01:14:11,242 --> 01:14:13,801
Martin, you know that
you're more than a butler to me.

1136
01:14:13,922 --> 01:14:16,121
You're more like a lovable brother who
just happens to wait on us, and, anyway,

1137
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:19,838
- I was wondering if--
- I would accompany you on the trip?

1138
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,998
- Make it a bit easier for you?
- Would you, Martin? Thank you so much.

1139
01:14:23,157 --> 01:14:25,436
I'd be so grateful and you don't
even have to come as our butler.

1140
01:14:25,597 --> 01:14:27,638
- Just as a friend.
- Madam, I'd be honoured.

1141
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:31,474
And may I say as a friend,
if I was seeing my ex...

1142
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:33,755
after 11 years
and I had your legs,

1143
01:14:36,553 --> 01:14:37,751
I'd wear
this little baby.

1144
01:14:39,672 --> 01:14:41,671
You'll kill in it!

1145
01:14:48,068 --> 01:14:50,267
- Bye, darling.
- Wish me luck.

1146
01:14:50,427 --> 01:14:52,188
Good luck.

1147
01:14:55,026 --> 01:14:57,026
- Bye, Pop.
- Bye, Hal.

1148
01:14:57,187 --> 01:14:59,425
So you're coming to Napa
for Thanksgiving. Right?

1149
01:14:59,585 --> 01:15:01,863
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

1150
01:15:02,023 --> 01:15:05,223
Bye.

1151
01:15:05,384 --> 01:15:08,863
- Oh, and say hello to your father for me.
- I will.

1152
01:15:18,178 --> 01:15:20,056
Airport, please.

1153
01:15:39,048 --> 01:15:41,289
Okay. They'll be here
any minute.

1154
01:15:41,449 --> 01:15:44,486
Now, be nice, Daddy.
He's everything you ever wanted...

1155
01:15:44,647 --> 01:15:47,208
for your little girl,
plus millions more.

1156
01:15:47,368 --> 01:15:49,326
Then you know
I'll be nice.

1157
01:15:51,407 --> 01:15:54,324
Oh! Okay. There he is...

1158
01:15:54,484 --> 01:15:57,844
with the whole
motley crew.

1159
01:15:59,163 --> 01:16:01,801
- Hi, darling.
- Hi.

1160
01:16:01,962 --> 01:16:04,560
Hallie, Chessy
and Sammy!

1161
01:16:04,722 --> 01:16:07,039
What in the world
are you doing here?

1162
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,118
Honey, a dog
at the Stafford?

1163
01:16:09,278 --> 01:16:12,238
- Hal begged me to bring him.
- Oh, you're such a softy.

1164
01:16:12,398 --> 01:16:14,677
- Oh!
- Good doggy.

1165
01:16:14,837 --> 01:16:16,837
So, Meredith.
These the folks?

1166
01:16:16,996 --> 01:16:19,755
Yes. Mom, Dad.
You finally meet.

1167
01:16:19,915 --> 01:16:23,794
This is my fianc and the love
of my life, Nicholas Parker.

1168
01:16:23,953 --> 01:16:26,911
Hello, Nicholas.
I'm so pleased to meet you.

1169
01:16:27,072 --> 01:16:28,833
- I'm Vicki.
- Hi.

1170
01:16:28,991 --> 01:16:31,151
And this is Nick's
adorable daughter, Hallie.

1171
01:16:31,311 --> 01:16:34,430
This entire prenuptial get together
was her idea, I'll have you know.

1172
01:16:34,591 --> 01:16:36,389
How are you, young lady?
We've heard nothing...

1173
01:16:36,549 --> 01:16:40,669
- but wonderful things about you.
- Hello, pet.

1174
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:43,546
You may call me
Aunt Vicki.

1175
01:16:54,303 --> 01:16:57,022
- Other end, madam.
- Oops!

1176
01:17:01,579 --> 01:17:04,177
- Yopes!
- That was a great flight. Wasn't it?

1177
01:17:04,338 --> 01:17:08,097
- I mean, it was so quick.
- I've never seen you quite so thirsty before, madam.

1178
01:17:08,257 --> 01:17:12,056
Well, would you believe, Martin darling,
I've never tasted vodka before this trip.

1179
01:17:13,176 --> 01:17:14,335
You could have
fooled me, ma'am.

1180
01:17:14,495 --> 01:17:16,413
Come on. Let's rock and roll.

1181
01:17:16,574 --> 01:17:19,574
I am in such
major trouble here.

1182
01:17:19,734 --> 01:17:22,611
If the hotel can do it, I think
that room is perfect for the wedding.

1183
01:17:22,772 --> 01:17:24,732
Not too big. Not too cramped.
And not that...

1184
01:17:24,892 --> 01:17:26,650
I don't like the idea
of having the wedding at the house,

1185
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:30,650
- it's just that this could be amazing.
- Sammy!

1186
01:17:30,809 --> 01:17:33,128
So, I've already checked us in.
Why don't we go upstairs,

1187
01:17:33,287 --> 01:17:36,168
- freshen up and then rendezvous for lunch?
- Great!

1188
01:17:36,327 --> 01:17:39,645
- Meet you in the bar in ten. Okay?
- Oh! Perf.

1189
01:17:39,805 --> 01:17:41,926
Sweetheart,
now that we're here,

1190
01:17:42,086 --> 01:17:44,485
why don't we go check out
the honeymoon suite?

1191
01:17:44,644 --> 01:17:47,364
I bet it is to die for.

1192
01:17:53,322 --> 01:17:56,240
Ooh. Oops!
I forgot my bag.

1193
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,198
Hey, hang on. Sammy!

1194
01:17:59,358 --> 01:18:01,478
Sammy!

1195
01:18:05,235 --> 01:18:10,394
- Sammy.
- Excuse me. Did you find a beige-- Thank you.

1196
01:18:10,555 --> 01:18:12,634
- Oop!
- Mom!

1197
01:18:12,794 --> 01:18:15,272
Darling, you didn't have to wait for me.
I could have found the room by myself.

1198
01:18:15,433 --> 01:18:18,592
Besides, I need to get
a little fresh air.

1199
01:18:18,753 --> 01:18:22,630
Go on, sweetie.
I'll meet you up "thairs."

1200
01:18:22,789 --> 01:18:26,309
I like that jacket, by the way. Were you wearing
that the whole time we were on the plane?

1201
01:18:26,469 --> 01:18:29,830
- Mom, watch out!
- Sorry.

1202
01:18:29,988 --> 01:18:33,586
She's drunk. She's never had
more than one glass of wine...

1203
01:18:33,746 --> 01:18:37,624
in her entire life, and she chooses
today to show up totally zonked.

1204
01:18:37,785 --> 01:18:39,703
Yeah, well, just do
what the woman says...

1205
01:18:39,864 --> 01:18:41,623
and meet her up "thairs."

1206
01:18:44,383 --> 01:18:47,100
Maybe that's why they make
"do not disturb" signs.

1207
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:53,778
Alone at last.

1208
01:19:04,775 --> 01:19:07,734
Hallie Parker.

1209
01:19:07,894 --> 01:19:10,652
Oh. Don't do this to me.
I'm already seeing double.

1210
01:19:10,813 --> 01:19:12,812
It's me, Mom,
Annie.

1211
01:19:12,972 --> 01:19:14,730
Oh, darling.

1212
01:19:15,971 --> 01:19:17,728
You look wonderful.

1213
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:22,608
Oh, my girls.

1214
01:19:22,767 --> 01:19:25,248
I can't believe
you're together.

1215
01:19:25,407 --> 01:19:28,326
But how could you do this to me?

1216
01:19:28,486 --> 01:19:30,724
Excuse me.
I hate to interrupt but,

1217
01:19:30,886 --> 01:19:33,004
might I suggest that
we continue...

1218
01:19:33,166 --> 01:19:36,082
this little powwow inside?

1219
01:19:36,243 --> 01:19:38,003
Hi. You probably
don't remember me.

1220
01:19:38,163 --> 01:19:39,922
Chessy!

1221
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,601
I knew I always
liked her.

1222
01:19:43,762 --> 01:19:47,039
One of you, I'm not sure
which one at the moment,

1223
01:19:47,198 --> 01:19:50,798
but one of you told me your father
knew I was arriving here today.

1224
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:53,557
And I'm here to tell you
the man I just saw in the elevator...

1225
01:19:53,716 --> 01:19:58,036
had absolutely no idea he and I were on the
same planet, let alone in the same hotel.

1226
01:19:58,196 --> 01:20:00,953
- You saw Dad already?
- Yes, I did.

1227
01:20:01,113 --> 01:20:03,914
Oh! The man went
completely ashen like I was...

1228
01:20:04,073 --> 01:20:06,271
the bloody ghost
of Christmas past.

1229
01:20:06,431 --> 01:20:08,832
Can one of you get
something cold for my head?

1230
01:20:08,991 --> 01:20:11,390
I mean, don't you think I pondered
what it was going to be like to see...

1231
01:20:11,551 --> 01:20:13,871
your father after
all these years?

1232
01:20:14,030 --> 01:20:16,508
Well, let me tell you.
Me waving like a mindless idiot...

1233
01:20:16,667 --> 01:20:19,227
while Nick Parker's wrapped around
another woman's arms...

1234
01:20:19,386 --> 01:20:21,227
is not exactly the scenario
I had in mind.

1235
01:20:21,388 --> 01:20:23,306
No, sirree.

1236
01:20:23,466 --> 01:20:26,306
Martin! What are you doing?

1237
01:20:26,465 --> 01:20:28,784
Going for a dip, madam. Do you mind?

1238
01:20:28,944 --> 01:20:32,944
Uh? No, no. No, that's--
that's perfectly perfect. Have fun.

1239
01:20:33,103 --> 01:20:35,981
- Someone ought to.
- Hello.

1240
01:20:36,141 --> 01:20:38,341
Hello.
Hello to you.

1241
01:20:38,502 --> 01:20:41,378
- Chessy, this is our butler Martin.
- How do you do?

1242
01:20:41,539 --> 01:20:43,499
I'm her butler.

1243
01:20:46,658 --> 01:20:51,616
Gee! The pleasure
is all mine, monsieur.

1244
01:20:51,775 --> 01:20:54,813
Girls, you were going
to tell me why you lied...

1245
01:20:54,974 --> 01:20:57,854
- and brought me here without telling your father.
- Were they?

1246
01:20:58,014 --> 01:21:01,331
Okay, that's good. Uh, well,
then I'm just gonna go back to my room and check out...

1247
01:21:01,491 --> 01:21:03,892
- the old mini-bar situation.
- Allow me to assist you.

1248
01:21:04,051 --> 01:21:08,491
Wait! Does everyone here
know something I don't know?

1249
01:21:10,208 --> 01:21:13,287
Mom. Daddy's
getting married.

1250
01:21:15,766 --> 01:21:18,046
To Cruella de Vil.
She's awful, Mom.

1251
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:21,405
- We can't let him go through with it.
- She's all wrong for him, Mom.

1252
01:21:21,566 --> 01:21:24,724
And the only way he won't marry her
is if-- You tell her.

1253
01:21:24,883 --> 01:21:27,444
She knows you better.

1254
01:21:28,922 --> 01:21:32,842
- Is if he sees you again.
- Wait a minute!

1255
01:21:33,002 --> 01:21:35,039
You're not trying to set me up
with your father?

1256
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:38,358
Actually, we are.
You're perfect for each other.

1257
01:21:38,517 --> 01:21:41,237
Hold it.
You two knew about this?

1258
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:43,676
What? Oh, no.

1259
01:21:43,836 --> 01:21:48,754
- No! Madam, no. Absolutely no idea.
- No, no, no, no. I had no idea.

1260
01:21:48,914 --> 01:21:52,274
- Yes. I did know something.
- Yes. Technically, yes. I had an inkling anyway.

1261
01:21:52,435 --> 01:21:55,192
- Hallie told me the story.
- It's their idea. It's so sweet.

1262
01:21:55,351 --> 01:21:57,553
- I'm an old romantic, you know. You know me.
- So am l.

1263
01:21:57,712 --> 01:22:00,549
Okay, okay.
Let me say this...

1264
01:22:00,710 --> 01:22:02,509
Ioud and clear.

1265
01:22:02,670 --> 01:22:05,988
Nick Parker and I have absolutely
nothing in common... any more.

1266
01:22:06,149 --> 01:22:08,907
Plus, in case
you haven't noticed,

1267
01:22:09,066 --> 01:22:14,225
he seems extremely content with his
leggy, tight-skirted, bare-backed fiance.

1268
01:22:14,384 --> 01:22:18,664
And I want the two of you to explain to your
father that I am here for one purpose only.

1269
01:22:18,824 --> 01:22:21,823
And that is to switch
the two of you back.

1270
01:22:21,984 --> 01:22:25,541
Now, let's do what we have to do
and be done with it. Understood?

1271
01:22:27,862 --> 01:22:29,820
- Hey, Dad. What's up?
- Hi. Just running down to the lobby. Hey, Hal!

1272
01:22:29,979 --> 01:22:31,939
- Huh?
- Do me a favour, will you, while I'm gone.

1273
01:22:32,098 --> 01:22:33,939
- Will you just look after Meredith for me?
- Mm-hmm.

1274
01:22:34,099 --> 01:22:36,416
- Huh? Thanks. Hallie, Hallie.
- Yeah?

1275
01:22:36,577 --> 01:22:39,015
How do I look?
Like presentable and everything?

1276
01:22:39,175 --> 01:22:43,775
- Not too old?
- You look fab, Dad. Young and fab.

1277
01:22:50,652 --> 01:22:54,970
- Dad.
- I thought you were going to keep Meredith company.

1278
01:22:55,130 --> 01:22:56,890
- I was?
- Yeah.

1279
01:22:57,049 --> 01:23:00,569
I mean, I am, yeah. I was
just looking for her, actually.

1280
01:23:00,727 --> 01:23:02,687
Great to see you,
Dad.

1281
01:23:02,847 --> 01:23:05,167
It's great to see
you too, squirt.

1282
01:23:06,807 --> 01:23:08,965
- Nice outfit.
- Oh. Thanks.

1283
01:23:09,125 --> 01:23:11,605
Well, go on.
Get up there. Come on.

1284
01:23:11,765 --> 01:23:13,923
* Let's get together
Yeah, yeah, yeah *

1285
01:23:14,083 --> 01:23:16,363
* Why don't you and I combine *

1286
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:18,522
* Let's get together
What do you say **

1287
01:23:18,682 --> 01:23:20,560
- Have you seen your father?
- You talkin' to me?

1288
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:23,760
What are you? Robert De Niro?
Yes, I am talking to you.

1289
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,478
Oh, Meredith.

1290
01:23:26,598 --> 01:23:29,997
- Uh, yeah. I just saw him.
- Well, hello! Where was he?

1291
01:23:30,157 --> 01:23:32,396
Uh, he went that-a-way.
I think.

1292
01:23:39,393 --> 01:23:42,434
- What are you staring at?
- Oh, nothing, nothing.

1293
01:23:42,593 --> 01:23:45,470
You're just really very pretty.
That's all.

1294
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:48,232
Oh. Don't tell me you're gonna
break your rotten streak...

1295
01:23:48,392 --> 01:23:50,510
and suddenly
be nice to me?

1296
01:23:50,669 --> 01:23:54,030
If you see your father,
tell him he's late and I'm waiting.

1297
01:23:56,428 --> 01:23:59,067
Whatever you say,
Cruella.

1298
01:24:05,345 --> 01:24:09,263
Here you go.
This will cure anything you've got.

1299
01:24:09,422 --> 01:24:12,143
- Just don't ask what's in it.
- Okay.

1300
01:24:14,021 --> 01:24:17,781
Here's to--
Here's to you.

1301
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:20,618
May your life be
far less complicated than mine.

1302
01:24:20,778 --> 01:24:22,578
Thank you.

1303
01:24:22,738 --> 01:24:25,497
Ugh.

1304
01:24:25,657 --> 01:24:27,496
Martini, dry, please.

1305
01:24:27,656 --> 01:24:29,816
I beg your pardon.
I--

1306
01:24:29,976 --> 01:24:32,655
I think I just drank tar.

1307
01:24:32,815 --> 01:24:36,293
Here's your martini
and your bill, Ms James.

1308
01:24:36,454 --> 01:24:38,452
Thank you.

1309
01:24:46,609 --> 01:24:50,728
- You're Elizabeth James?
- Guilty.

1310
01:24:50,888 --> 01:24:56,246
Ah! I just saw a wedding dress you designed
in Vogue and fell completely in love with it.

1311
01:24:56,406 --> 01:24:58,724
I faxed your office just yesterday
and they said you were out of town...

1312
01:24:58,884 --> 01:25:01,565
and didn't know
if you could make another.

1313
01:25:01,724 --> 01:25:06,084
- I can't believe it. It's fate. I'm Meredith Blake.
- How do you do?

1314
01:25:16,518 --> 01:25:18,279
Sorry.

1315
01:25:22,835 --> 01:25:26,115
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

1316
01:25:26,276 --> 01:25:28,193
Where have you been?
We've been looking all over for you.

1317
01:25:28,354 --> 01:25:31,114
Nicholas, I think this hotel
is perfect for the wedding.

1318
01:25:31,274 --> 01:25:34,591
- The more I see of it, the more I like it.
- Me too.

1319
01:25:34,751 --> 01:25:36,513
Absolutely.

1320
01:25:39,630 --> 01:25:43,469
Now, tell me, dear. How many are we
expecting from your side of the family?

1321
01:25:43,629 --> 01:25:45,748
Just a guestimate.

1322
01:25:45,908 --> 01:25:49,626
Can I get back to you on that?
I'm-- I'm not sure at the moment.

1323
01:25:49,785 --> 01:25:52,185
Excuse me.

1324
01:25:52,346 --> 01:25:54,706
Pardon me. Sorry.

1325
01:25:56,504 --> 01:25:58,903
- Oh, boss, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1326
01:25:59,062 --> 01:26:01,264
- Uh, sir? Oh!
- Dad, watch out!

1327
01:26:01,423 --> 01:26:04,500
Oh! - Oh, careful!

1328
01:26:25,694 --> 01:26:28,811
- Hello, Liz.
- Hello, Nick.

1329
01:26:30,411 --> 01:26:33,771
Well, gosh. There you are.
What do you know?

1330
01:26:33,930 --> 01:26:36,169
Uh... is there something going on here
that I should know about,

1331
01:26:36,329 --> 01:26:38,569
because I'm stunned
to see you.

1332
01:26:38,728 --> 01:26:42,567
But, uh, you don't seem
as stunned to see me.

1333
01:26:42,726 --> 01:26:48,124
I mean, I haven't seen or heard
from you in what-- ten, eleven years?

1334
01:26:48,284 --> 01:26:51,284
- All of a sudden on the very day that--
- Dad...

1335
01:26:51,444 --> 01:26:55,482
- I can explain why she's here.
- Hallie. You know who this is?

1336
01:26:55,643 --> 01:26:57,562
Actually, yes.

1337
01:26:57,721 --> 01:27:00,480
And actually,
I'm not Hallie.

1338
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:02,880
Actually,
I am.

1339
01:27:03,039 --> 01:27:05,079
Both of them?

1340
01:27:08,199 --> 01:27:11,157
Annie? Hallie?

1341
01:27:11,316 --> 01:27:13,956
I guess you and Mom kind of think
alike 'cause you both sent us...

1342
01:27:14,116 --> 01:27:16,354
to the same camp
and we met there.

1343
01:27:16,515 --> 01:27:19,672
And the whole thing
just sort of spilled out.

1344
01:27:19,832 --> 01:27:23,431
They switched
places on us, Nick.

1345
01:27:23,592 --> 01:27:25,910
You mean I've had Annie
with me all this time?

1346
01:27:26,071 --> 01:27:29,910
Well, I wanted to know what you were
like, and Hallie wanted to know Mom.

1347
01:27:30,069 --> 01:27:32,469
And...
are you angry?

1348
01:27:32,630 --> 01:27:35,388
Oh, honey.
Of course not.

1349
01:27:35,547 --> 01:27:37,905
I just can't believe
it's you.

1350
01:27:40,906 --> 01:27:44,303
Last time I saw you, you had diaper
rash. Oh, squirt, you're all wet.

1351
01:27:44,464 --> 01:27:47,703
- It's all right.
- Look at you.

1352
01:27:47,862 --> 01:27:51,982
Well, I'm grown up now
and quite without a father.

1353
01:27:52,142 --> 01:27:54,820
And I'm headed into my crazy,
mixed-up teenage years,

1354
01:27:54,981 --> 01:27:59,259
and I'll be the only girl I know
without a mother to fight with.

1355
01:27:59,419 --> 01:28:01,538
Hallie, you've been in London
all this time?

1356
01:28:02,859 --> 01:28:04,618
Come here,
squirt.

1357
01:28:09,417 --> 01:28:13,213
Mom's amazing, Dad. I don't know
how you ever let her go.

1358
01:28:13,372 --> 01:28:16,212
Girls, why-- why don't
you let your father and l...

1359
01:28:16,373 --> 01:28:18,532
talk alone for a couple
of minutes, okay?

1360
01:28:18,691 --> 01:28:22,810
- Sure. Fine.
- Take your time.

1361
01:28:22,970 --> 01:28:25,928
I don't
believe this.

1362
01:28:26,088 --> 01:28:27,969
Seeing them
together.

1363
01:28:28,129 --> 01:28:32,086
- And seeing you. Ow!
- Ooh! Let me help you with that.

1364
01:28:32,245 --> 01:28:35,965
- Oh, excuse me. Do you have a first aid kit?
- Yeah, of course.

1365
01:28:37,085 --> 01:28:38,843
Why don't you
lie down?

1366
01:28:40,924 --> 01:28:42,682
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1367
01:28:43,042 --> 01:28:46,322
So, how are you,
Lizzy?

1368
01:28:46,482 --> 01:28:48,919
Or does everyone
call you Elizabeth now?

1369
01:28:49,081 --> 01:28:51,640
Oh, no, no. Lizzy's-Lizzy's fine.

1370
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,759
My dad still calls
me Lizzy.

1371
01:28:53,919 --> 01:28:58,118
- Yeah. I've been, uh, been terrific.
- Yeah.

1372
01:28:58,277 --> 01:29:01,396
You know, you haven't
changed a bit.

1373
01:29:01,555 --> 01:29:03,715
Finally.
There you are.

1374
01:29:03,875 --> 01:29:08,112
Oh! Uh... oh, good. You've met.
Honey, Elizabeth designs...

1375
01:29:08,273 --> 01:29:10,114
wedding gowns
and she's going to make my--

1376
01:29:10,273 --> 01:29:12,752
Wait, um...
I-- I don't understand.

1377
01:29:12,911 --> 01:29:16,272
How did you two meet?
And Nicky, why are you all wet?

1378
01:29:16,431 --> 01:29:18,510
You're making my fiance's
wedding gown.

1379
01:29:18,669 --> 01:29:20,748
Well, I-I didn't know
she was your fiance.

1380
01:29:20,909 --> 01:29:23,228
Well, how did we meet?
How did you two meet?

1381
01:29:23,387 --> 01:29:26,027
- Am I missing something here?
- You know what?

1382
01:29:26,186 --> 01:29:29,426
- This is one small world.
- Um, how small?

1383
01:29:29,586 --> 01:29:31,464
- Hi, Meredith.
- Hello.

1384
01:29:31,625 --> 01:29:34,625
- How ya doin'?
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

1385
01:29:34,785 --> 01:29:39,022
Honey, did I ever mention to you
that Hallie was a twin?

1386
01:29:39,181 --> 01:29:42,021
No. I'm afraid you forgot
that little detail.

1387
01:29:42,181 --> 01:29:45,299
Don't feel bad, Mer.
He never mentioned it to me either.

1388
01:29:45,459 --> 01:29:48,578
By the way, I'm the real Hallie.
This is Annie.

1389
01:29:48,739 --> 01:29:52,378
She was pretending to be me
while I was pretending to be her.

1390
01:29:52,538 --> 01:29:56,735
And this is our mother,
Elizabeth James.

1391
01:29:56,896 --> 01:29:58,737
This is your mother?

1392
01:29:58,896 --> 01:30:01,494
- Yes. - Yes.
- You were married to him?

1393
01:30:01,653 --> 01:30:03,733
- Yeah.
- Guilty again.

1394
01:30:03,893 --> 01:30:06,572
Oh, well.
This is a small world.

1395
01:30:06,733 --> 01:30:08,611
- And getting smaller.
- And what a coincidence...

1396
01:30:08,772 --> 01:30:11,931
that we're all here
on the exact same weekend.

1397
01:30:12,090 --> 01:30:15,608
My, my, my.
How sweet.

1398
01:30:21,845 --> 01:30:23,927
Hal, I've had
enough surprises for one day.

1399
01:30:24,086 --> 01:30:26,523
Will you please just tell me
where we're going?

1400
01:30:26,684 --> 01:30:28,966
You're gonna love it, Dad.
Trust me.

1401
01:30:30,684 --> 01:30:32,722
Hello.

1402
01:30:34,921 --> 01:30:36,401
Hey.

1403
01:30:39,759 --> 01:30:44,398
So, uh... do you have
any idea where they're taking us?

1404
01:30:44,559 --> 01:30:47,357
- Not a clue.
- Right.

1405
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:06,231
Where are we?

1406
01:31:10,348 --> 01:31:12,188
This is where
we're eating?

1407
01:31:12,349 --> 01:31:16,546
No. Actually,
that's where we're eating.

1408
01:31:18,946 --> 01:31:21,184
It's ours for the night.

1409
01:31:21,344 --> 01:31:25,984
Wow! So, how exactly
are we paying for this?

1410
01:31:26,143 --> 01:31:30,102
- Well, we pooled our allowances.
- Yeah. Right, Annie.

1411
01:31:30,262 --> 01:31:32,301
Okay.
Grandfather chipped in a bit.

1412
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:35,738
- Annie.
- Okay. He chipped in a lot.

1413
01:31:35,899 --> 01:31:39,897
- Come on. You guys are gonna love it.
- Pretty snazzy.

1414
01:31:40,057 --> 01:31:44,776
Elizabeth and Nick,
your dinner awaits you.

1415
01:31:51,614 --> 01:31:53,373
Girls.

1416
01:32:00,371 --> 01:32:02,529
The table
is only set for two.

1417
01:32:02,690 --> 01:32:06,408
Oh, that's the other part
of the surprise.

1418
01:32:06,569 --> 01:32:10,446
- We're not joining you.
- You're not?

1419
01:32:10,606 --> 01:32:12,364
No, but I am.

1420
01:32:12,528 --> 01:32:15,564
Good evening. I'm Chessy,
and I'll be your server this evening.

1421
01:32:15,725 --> 01:32:18,565
- No wisecracks, please.
- And I'm Martin your sommelier.

1422
01:32:18,724 --> 01:32:20,683
May I offer you both
a taste of the bubbly...

1423
01:32:20,844 --> 01:32:22,602
in the hope that
you get a bit shnockered...

1424
01:32:22,762 --> 01:32:25,642
and not fire this lovely lady
and myself...

1425
01:32:25,801 --> 01:32:29,880
for following the orders
of these audacious 11-year-olds.

1426
01:32:30,039 --> 01:32:32,038
Annie, mood music,
please.

1427
01:32:36,156 --> 01:32:38,757
* I love you *

1428
01:32:39,956 --> 01:32:41,794
Just relax.

1429
01:32:41,954 --> 01:32:46,114
- * For sentimental reasons *
- Sail though time back to yesteryear.

1430
01:32:46,274 --> 01:32:49,912
* I hope you do believe me *

1431
01:32:50,073 --> 01:32:53,070
You do get all this,
don't you?

1432
01:32:53,231 --> 01:32:58,429
- Yes, I'm beginning to.
- * I'll give you my heart *

1433
01:32:58,589 --> 01:33:01,908
- They're recreating the night we met-- the boat,
the music-- - * I love you *

1434
01:33:02,069 --> 01:33:06,185
- The help.
- It's so sweet.

1435
01:33:06,345 --> 01:33:10,504
Martin, I think I'll take that drink.

1436
01:33:10,665 --> 01:33:12,944
Thank you, Martin.

1437
01:33:13,103 --> 01:33:16,542
Oh! Yeah.

1438
01:33:16,702 --> 01:33:21,940
- * And say we'll never part *
- To tell you the truth,

1439
01:33:22,101 --> 01:33:25,378
- I haven't been on a boat since the Q.E. 2.
- Neither have l.

1440
01:33:25,538 --> 01:33:29,137
Hmm? Well, then,
here's to, uh--

1441
01:33:29,298 --> 01:33:31,215
Our daughters.

1442
01:33:31,496 --> 01:33:35,055
Our daughters.

1443
01:33:37,454 --> 01:33:39,854
* Darling, I'm never lonely *

1444
01:33:40,014 --> 01:33:44,813
- Now I know how a goldfish feels.
- Ugh!

1445
01:33:44,972 --> 01:33:47,172
You know, sometime
if we're ever really alone,

1446
01:33:47,331 --> 01:33:50,171
maybe we could...
talk about...

1447
01:33:50,330 --> 01:33:52,890
what happened
between us.

1448
01:33:53,049 --> 01:33:57,408
It all feels a bit hazy to me now.
It ended so fast.

1449
01:33:57,568 --> 01:34:00,245
It started so fast.

1450
01:34:00,406 --> 01:34:02,568
Well, that part
I remember perfectly.

1451
01:34:05,285 --> 01:34:09,125
- * I've given you my heart **
- It looks like things are heating up quite nicely.

1452
01:34:09,284 --> 01:34:11,843
I'd say it's safe
to serve the vichyssoise.

1453
01:34:11,963 --> 01:34:14,402
You ladle,
I'll serve.

1454
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:19,318
I'm sorry.

1455
01:34:23,678 --> 01:34:26,878
Yes, I'll...
uh, ladle.

1456
01:34:27,038 --> 01:34:30,515
Right.
And then I'll--

1457
01:34:30,674 --> 01:34:32,434
- Serve?
- Right.

1458
01:34:32,594 --> 01:34:34,354
Right.

1459
01:34:34,515 --> 01:34:39,992
So... you've done
fantastically well. Um...

1460
01:34:40,152 --> 01:34:43,991
your dream of owning your own
vineyard actually came true.

1461
01:34:44,150 --> 01:34:46,070
Mm-hmm. What about you?
You were always drawing...

1462
01:34:46,230 --> 01:34:48,789
on napkins
and corners of newspapers.

1463
01:34:48,948 --> 01:34:53,268
- Now you're this major designer.
- Yeah, it's great.

1464
01:34:53,427 --> 01:34:55,745
We both actually got
where we wanted to go.

1465
01:34:55,905 --> 01:34:58,186
Yeah, we did.

1466
01:35:00,384 --> 01:35:03,744
Anyway, what are we going
to do about the girls?

1467
01:35:03,903 --> 01:35:06,463
Well, now that they met,
we can't very well keep them apart.

1468
01:35:06,623 --> 01:35:09,742
Well, I could keep them for half of
the year, and then you could keep them.

1469
01:35:09,901 --> 01:35:12,461
- Well-- - Guys.
They can't go to two different schools every year.

1470
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:14,539
- That's nuts.
- I agree.

1471
01:35:14,698 --> 01:35:16,539
Well, then, I could keep them both for
a whole year, and you could keep them...

1472
01:35:16,700 --> 01:35:18,458
- Liz.
- Hmm. Mm-mm.

1473
01:35:18,618 --> 01:35:20,376
- That's why we came up with--
- Mm-hmm.

1474
01:35:20,536 --> 01:35:25,255
Oh, G-- Sorry. Ignore me. Enjoy your soup.

1475
01:35:25,414 --> 01:35:28,215
That's why we came up
with the solution that we have.

1476
01:35:28,376 --> 01:35:31,053
Really?
I thought it was because...

1477
01:35:31,214 --> 01:35:33,614
we decided never to see
each other again.

1478
01:35:33,773 --> 01:35:36,091
Not we, Liz.

1479
01:35:36,252 --> 01:35:39,649
Well, you know, that part's become
a bit hazy to me, too, over the years.

1480
01:35:39,811 --> 01:35:44,088
- You don't remember the day you packed?
- No, that day I remember perfectly.

1481
01:35:44,248 --> 01:35:46,328
Did I hurt you when
I threw that, um...

1482
01:35:46,489 --> 01:35:50,006
- What was it? Uh, uh--
- It was... a hair dryer.

1483
01:35:50,165 --> 01:35:54,843
Oh, right. Sorry.

1484
01:35:56,884 --> 01:36:00,682
You know, I may never
be alone with you again.

1485
01:36:00,843 --> 01:36:05,561
So, about that day that you packed--
Why'd you do it?

1486
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:07,879
Oh, Nick.
We were so young...

1487
01:36:08,039 --> 01:36:10,959
and we both had tempers.

1488
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:13,837
We said stupid things
and so I packed.

1489
01:36:13,997 --> 01:36:15,957
Got on
my very first 747,

1490
01:36:16,116 --> 01:36:20,755
and... you didn't
come after me.

1491
01:36:20,914 --> 01:36:23,474
I didn't know that
you wanted me to.

1492
01:36:26,194 --> 01:36:28,191
Well, it doesn't
really matter any more.

1493
01:36:28,352 --> 01:36:30,992
So, let's just
put a good face on...

1494
01:36:31,151 --> 01:36:34,108
for the girls and get the show
on the road, huh?

1495
01:36:34,269 --> 01:36:37,588
Yeah, sure.
Let's...

1496
01:36:37,749 --> 01:36:40,227
get the show
on the road.

1497
01:36:46,025 --> 01:36:48,505
Your passport, Ms James.
Have a safe trip home.

1498
01:36:49,104 --> 01:36:50,423
Thank you.

1499
01:36:50,585 --> 01:36:54,103
- All set then. Where's Annie?
- I just rang up. She's on her way down.

1500
01:36:54,263 --> 01:36:56,022
Right.

1501
01:36:58,180 --> 01:37:00,260
So, I'll send Hallie
back to you over Christmas.

1502
01:37:00,422 --> 01:37:04,099
- And Annie will spend Easter with you.
- Mm-hmm.

1503
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:11,098
Honey, what are you doing in those
clothes? We've got a plane to catch.

1504
01:37:11,257 --> 01:37:15,775
Here's the deal, Mom. We thought it over,
and we decided we're being totally gypped.

1505
01:37:15,935 --> 01:37:20,173
Dad promised we'd go on our camping
trip. And we want to go... together.

1506
01:37:20,334 --> 01:37:22,212
What camping trip?

1507
01:37:22,372 --> 01:37:24,532
The one we go on every summer
before school starts.

1508
01:37:24,691 --> 01:37:26,531
Annie, this is ridiculous.
Go upstairs and put your clothes on.

1509
01:37:26,692 --> 01:37:29,490
- Are you sure I'm Annie?
- Well, of course, I'm sure.

1510
01:37:29,651 --> 01:37:33,687
But, it's kind of hard
to be 100 %/% positive, isn't it?

1511
01:37:33,847 --> 01:37:37,007
Girls, this is totally unfunny.
You're gonna make your mother miss her aeroplane.

1512
01:37:37,168 --> 01:37:38,887
- Annie!
- Yes!

1513
01:37:46,602 --> 01:37:48,604
This one's Hallie.
I'm positive.

1514
01:37:48,763 --> 01:37:50,642
You know, I hope
you're right, Dad.

1515
01:37:50,803 --> 01:37:54,721
Because you wouldn't want to send the
wrong kid all the way back to England.

1516
01:37:54,881 --> 01:37:56,639
Would you?

1517
01:38:02,878 --> 01:38:06,158
Here's our proposition.

1518
01:38:06,317 --> 01:38:08,355
We go back to Dad's house,
pack our stuff,

1519
01:38:08,515 --> 01:38:11,154
and the four of us leave
on the camping trip.

1520
01:38:11,314 --> 01:38:13,873
- The four of us?
- And when you bring us back,

1521
01:38:14,034 --> 01:38:17,192
- we'll tell you who's Annie and who's Hallie.
- Or you do as we say,

1522
01:38:17,351 --> 01:38:21,990
and I take one of you back with me
to London whether you like it or not.

1523
01:38:27,947 --> 01:38:30,828
And what am I supposed to do
for three days? Sit home and knit?

1524
01:38:30,987 --> 01:38:33,347
Honey, we have kind of
a sticky situation.

1525
01:38:33,506 --> 01:38:38,465
- Sticky situation? What do you mean,
"sticky situation"? What exactly-- - Hmm-hmm.

1526
01:38:40,304 --> 01:38:42,422
Excuse me.
What is she doing here?

1527
01:38:42,585 --> 01:38:44,342
You see, that's part of the deal.
The four of us--

1528
01:38:44,502 --> 01:38:46,861
We... go together.

1529
01:38:47,020 --> 01:38:49,421
- What are you suddenly, the Brady Bunch? This is ridic--
- Hello.

1530
01:38:49,582 --> 01:38:51,380
Everything all right?

1531
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:53,298
Well, no.
Actually it isn't.

1532
01:38:53,457 --> 01:38:56,378
I didn't realize that
you were going on this little outing.

1533
01:38:56,538 --> 01:39:00,256
- And to tell you the truth,
I'm not so sure that I'm okay with it. - I agree.

1534
01:39:00,415 --> 01:39:03,615
I think the ex-wife in
the next sleeping bag is a little weird.

1535
01:39:03,775 --> 01:39:07,934
- Thank you.
- I absolutely insist that you come with us. Really.

1536
01:39:08,095 --> 01:39:10,093
Liz--

1537
01:39:11,012 --> 01:39:12,012
No, honestly, Nick.
I've messed up your entire weekend.

1538
01:39:12,171 --> 01:39:15,731
It's the least I can do.
Really, please.

1539
01:39:26,248 --> 01:39:28,005
Dad, what's Meredith
doing here?

1540
01:39:28,166 --> 01:39:31,446
- Your mother invited her.
- What?

1541
01:39:31,605 --> 01:39:33,364
Be nice.

1542
01:39:45,281 --> 01:39:49,078
- Okay. All set? Have fun, everyone.
- What?

1543
01:39:49,238 --> 01:39:51,238
Liz, what are
you doing?

1544
01:39:51,398 --> 01:39:55,316
Well, I really think that you and Meredith
need some time alone before the big day.

1545
01:39:55,475 --> 01:39:57,355
Mom, come on!
That's not the plan.

1546
01:39:57,516 --> 01:39:59,676
Ah, honestly, you'll have
much more fun without me.

1547
01:39:59,834 --> 01:40:02,993
Wait, wait. If you're not going,
I certainly don't have to go.

1548
01:40:03,154 --> 01:40:04,914
I mean, trust me,
I'm not a big nature girl.

1549
01:40:05,073 --> 01:40:06,911
But this is your chance
to really get to know the girls.

1550
01:40:07,072 --> 01:40:09,712
I mean after all,
starting next week, they're--

1551
01:40:09,871 --> 01:40:11,630
they're half yours.

1552
01:40:17,268 --> 01:40:19,187
Have fun all of you!

1553
01:40:23,585 --> 01:40:25,344
Bye-bye!

1554
01:40:25,505 --> 01:40:29,344
Oh, I would pay big money
to see that woman climb a mountain.

1555
01:40:37,181 --> 01:40:39,341
Whoa!

1556
01:40:39,501 --> 01:40:42,898
- Come on, you guys.
- Whoa! Oh!

1557
01:40:56,133 --> 01:41:00,332
Oh, I'm gonna
kill my trainer.

1558
01:41:00,491 --> 01:41:04,291
He says I'm in such great shape. I can't
believe people actually do this for fun.

1559
01:41:05,930 --> 01:41:07,849
Hold on.
We're stopping.

1560
01:41:08,008 --> 01:41:11,209
Again? Dad, at this rate,
it'll take us...

1561
01:41:11,368 --> 01:41:13,126
three days just
to get to the lake.

1562
01:41:13,287 --> 01:41:17,286
Meredith isn't used to the altitude.
Just chill, okay?

1563
01:41:17,446 --> 01:41:21,566
Ooh.

1564
01:41:21,725 --> 01:41:24,444
Ah, I'm in serious pain.

1565
01:41:24,604 --> 01:41:28,523
Somebody hand me my Evian.
I can't move.

1566
01:41:28,683 --> 01:41:30,681
Sure.

1567
01:41:34,721 --> 01:41:36,478
Brilliant.

1568
01:41:41,158 --> 01:41:42,917
Here you go, Mer.

1569
01:41:50,873 --> 01:41:54,233
Honey, you okay?
What happened?

1570
01:41:54,393 --> 01:41:57,271
This little guy was
on her Evian bottle.

1571
01:41:57,431 --> 01:42:00,111
Oh, he won't hurt you,
Meredith.

1572
01:42:00,271 --> 01:42:02,509
Oh, right, right, right.
Right. I know.

1573
01:42:02,669 --> 01:42:05,789
You, uh, go ahead.

1574
01:42:05,949 --> 01:42:07,947
I'll be fine.

1575
01:42:08,107 --> 01:42:10,267
Get that thing away from me.

1576
01:42:10,508 --> 01:42:11,546
I hate things that crawl.

1577
01:42:11,707 --> 01:42:14,785
Aagh! How can you touch that?
Just put it down.

1578
01:42:14,944 --> 01:42:17,664
Okay. Okay.
I'll put it down.

1579
01:42:19,344 --> 01:42:22,663
- Girls?
- What? - What?

1580
01:42:22,822 --> 01:42:25,861
I'm going to take the lead. The two
of you help Meredith. All right?

1581
01:42:26,021 --> 01:42:28,581
Sure, you'll help me.

1582
01:42:28,701 --> 01:42:32,099
Right over a cliff,
you'll help me.

1583
01:42:32,258 --> 01:42:35,458
- Not a bad idea.
- Yeah. See any cliffs?

1584
01:42:35,619 --> 01:42:38,177
- Aah, my backpack.
- Need a hand, Mer?

1585
01:42:40,497 --> 01:42:45,773
Not from you, thank you.
Don't think I can't see right past those angelic faces.

1586
01:42:45,932 --> 01:42:47,694
One more trick from you two,
and I promise...

1587
01:42:47,854 --> 01:42:52,130
I will make your lives miserable
from the day I say "I do."

1588
01:42:52,290 --> 01:42:55,610
Got it?

1589
01:42:55,770 --> 01:42:59,090
Got it, Cruella.

1590
01:42:59,250 --> 01:43:02,047
What did you call me?

1591
01:43:02,207 --> 01:43:05,687
Nothing, nothing.
Not a thing, Cruella.

1592
01:43:05,847 --> 01:43:10,165
Oh, by the way, Mer, I think there's
something on your head.

1593
01:43:23,362 --> 01:43:27,558
Are you all right?

1594
01:43:27,719 --> 01:43:32,638
- Aah!
- What... happened?

1595
01:43:32,797 --> 01:43:36,634
Ask... them.

1596
01:43:42,555 --> 01:43:46,590
What did we do, Dad?
We were right behind you.

1597
01:43:50,269 --> 01:43:52,948
Here we go, girls.
This will hold us for a while.

1598
01:43:57,907 --> 01:43:59,988
Sure you don't want
some trout, Mom?

1599
01:44:00,147 --> 01:44:02,386
Is that okay, by the way,
if we start calling you mom?

1600
01:44:02,546 --> 01:44:05,705
I think your mother would prefer
if you called me Meredith.

1601
01:44:05,864 --> 01:44:11,102
And no thank you. I do not eat...
trout... for the thousandth time.

1602
01:44:11,261 --> 01:44:13,462
I will wait
until breakfast.

1603
01:44:13,623 --> 01:44:15,501
- What are we having?
- Trout.

1604
01:44:15,660 --> 01:44:18,141
Come on. It's part of the experience.

1605
01:44:18,301 --> 01:44:21,538
Mmm. And what's the other part?
Being eaten to death by mosquitoes?

1606
01:44:21,698 --> 01:44:24,138
God, you'd think
they actually like this stuff.

1607
01:44:24,299 --> 01:44:27,296
Well, what's that you're using?
Let me see that.

1608
01:44:30,656 --> 01:44:34,653
Well, you're gonna attract every
mosquito in the state with this stuff.

1609
01:44:34,813 --> 01:44:36,973
It's sugar and water.
Where'd you get it?

1610
01:44:38,973 --> 01:44:42,372
That's it. I am taking
one large sleeping pill...

1611
01:44:42,533 --> 01:44:44,450
and going to bed.

1612
01:44:50,968 --> 01:44:54,006
Meredith,
what are you doing?

1613
01:44:54,165 --> 01:44:57,446
I don't want the mountain lions to--

1614
01:44:57,606 --> 01:45:01,525
There are no mountain lions
up here, are there?

1615
01:45:03,203 --> 01:45:04,962
No.

1616
01:45:20,197 --> 01:45:21,956
Good night.

1617
01:45:26,275 --> 01:45:29,314
Girls, I'm telling you.
Lay off.

1618
01:45:29,473 --> 01:45:32,394
This isn't her thing, okay? I'm not
marrying her because she's Annie Oakley.

1619
01:45:32,553 --> 01:45:34,312
Who's Annie Oakley?

1620
01:45:34,471 --> 01:45:37,431
Just cool it.

1621
01:45:53,106 --> 01:45:55,305
Come on. Come on.

1622
01:45:55,466 --> 01:45:57,224
Okay.

1623
01:45:57,384 --> 01:46:00,582
I hope that
one large sleeping pill worked.

1624
01:46:07,821 --> 01:46:10,299
- You take that side.
- All right.

1625
01:46:13,337 --> 01:46:17,617
- Gosh, she's heavy.
- She's also like... snoring.

1626
01:46:25,531 --> 01:46:28,372
Nicky?

1627
01:46:53,962 --> 01:46:57,083
Sweet dreams, Mommie Dearest.

1628
01:47:11,756 --> 01:47:16,035
Mmm.
That feels nice.

1629
01:47:25,670 --> 01:47:28,870
Nicky!

1630
01:47:31,430 --> 01:47:34,509
Oh, man.

1631
01:47:34,668 --> 01:47:36,428
Ooh!

1632
01:47:42,785 --> 01:47:44,544
Ugh!

1633
01:47:47,264 --> 01:47:50,261
Ugh! Ugh!

1634
01:47:50,421 --> 01:47:53,301
- What's goin' on?
- Here's what's going on, buddy!

1635
01:47:53,462 --> 01:47:56,860
The day we get married is the day
I ship those brats off to Switzerland.

1636
01:47:57,021 --> 01:48:01,738
Get the picture?
It's me or them. Take your pick.

1637
01:48:03,938 --> 01:48:06,057
Them.

1638
01:48:06,217 --> 01:48:11,055
- Excuse me?
- T-H-E-M, them.

1639
01:48:11,216 --> 01:48:12,974
Get the picture?

1640
01:48:29,448 --> 01:48:32,087
Hello.
You're back so soon.

1641
01:48:32,246 --> 01:48:35,606
- Did you have fun?
- Well, I wouldn't go right to fun.

1642
01:48:35,766 --> 01:48:39,603
- You wouldn't?
- We've been punished to the end of the century.

1643
01:48:39,764 --> 01:48:44,282
- Starting now. Go!
- Where's Meredith?

1644
01:48:44,441 --> 01:48:49,840
We played a couple of harmless tricks on
her and she kind of freaked out a little.

1645
01:48:49,999 --> 01:48:53,079
A little?
Hmm.

1646
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:56,398
She threw this
at my head.

1647
01:48:56,557 --> 01:48:59,117
At least it's smaller
than a hair dryer.

1648
01:48:59,237 --> 01:49:01,836
Oh, Nick, it's all my fault.
If I hadn't suggested she go--

1649
01:49:01,995 --> 01:49:05,316
Or tricked!
Tricked would be more like it.

1650
01:49:05,475 --> 01:49:07,513
Like mother,
like daughters.

1651
01:49:07,673 --> 01:49:09,432
I-I really am sorry.

1652
01:49:09,592 --> 01:49:12,152
- We are too, Dad. Really.
- Yeah.

1653
01:49:12,272 --> 01:49:14,670
Up to your room...
now.

1654
01:49:20,589 --> 01:49:22,909
I gotta remember
to thank them one day.

1655
01:49:27,066 --> 01:49:30,346
So, where's Chessy?
I'm starving.

1656
01:49:30,506 --> 01:49:35,506
Well, she and Martin went off on
a picnic around noon... yesterday.

1657
01:49:35,665 --> 01:49:38,622
Really! Who would
have thought-- my nanny, your butler!

1658
01:49:38,783 --> 01:49:40,983
Hmm.

1659
01:49:41,142 --> 01:49:43,780
Well, what do you say,
I whip us up something to eat?

1660
01:49:43,940 --> 01:49:49,058
- You can cook now?
- Oh, yeah. I can, uh, make pasta and pasta and, uh--

1661
01:49:49,218 --> 01:49:53,777
- Mmm, pasta sounds good.
- Well, pasta it is.

1662
01:49:59,095 --> 01:50:01,095
Okay, I'll take two.

1663
01:50:01,255 --> 01:50:06,133
- Hey, Dad!
- Wow! You look so nice!

1664
01:50:06,293 --> 01:50:10,771
- Where are you going?
- Good night, ladies.

1665
01:50:18,448 --> 01:50:22,685
- Oh, wow!
- This is where I keep my private stash.

1666
01:50:22,846 --> 01:50:25,046
Did you know
I also collect wine?

1667
01:50:25,206 --> 01:50:28,803
- Really?
- I'm a man of limited interest. Come here.

1668
01:50:30,883 --> 01:50:34,881
This...
is a 1921 Burgundy.

1669
01:50:35,042 --> 01:50:40,479
- They say the rain that year made this
the best Burgundy ever harvested. - Oh.

1670
01:50:40,639 --> 01:50:42,879
Now, you will appreciate this.
Come here.

1671
01:50:52,554 --> 01:50:54,396
Look.

1672
01:50:54,557 --> 01:50:57,553
"VJ day, 1945."

1673
01:50:57,713 --> 01:51:00,554
- That's incredible.
- I love that.

1674
01:51:05,510 --> 01:51:08,749
Now, this is the same wine that
was served at my parents' wedding.

1675
01:51:08,908 --> 01:51:10,788
- A Bordeaux-- '52.
- Aww.

1676
01:51:10,949 --> 01:51:14,148
I think my sister
was conceived on this baby.

1677
01:51:16,226 --> 01:51:20,226
What's this one?
"Where dreams have no end--

1678
01:51:20,385 --> 01:51:24,944
- 1983."
- That one actually took me years to track down.

1679
01:51:25,105 --> 01:51:28,781
Why?
Where's it from?

1680
01:51:28,941 --> 01:51:32,261
It's the wine that we drank
at our wedding.

1681
01:51:35,020 --> 01:51:37,100
I know. I have
every bottle ever made.

1682
01:51:37,259 --> 01:51:39,859
You do?

1683
01:51:40,018 --> 01:51:42,737
I do.

1684
01:51:46,056 --> 01:51:49,376
- Can we open one?
- You're the only one I'd drink it with.

1685
01:51:52,733 --> 01:51:56,852
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah. I just got a little dust in my eye.

1686
01:51:57,011 --> 01:51:59,051
Hmm?
I can offer you a clean sleeve.

1687
01:51:59,211 --> 01:52:04,009
No, no.
I'm fine really. All better.

1688
01:52:04,170 --> 01:52:07,529
You don't always have
to be so brave, you know.

1689
01:52:07,688 --> 01:52:11,247
Oh, but I do actually.

1690
01:52:18,363 --> 01:52:20,924
That will be Chessy.

1691
01:52:21,084 --> 01:52:24,122
She has a key.

1692
01:52:34,718 --> 01:52:39,117
Hello. Anybody home?

1693
01:52:39,277 --> 01:52:41,035
We'll be right up.

1694
01:53:05,427 --> 01:53:07,505
* Oh *

1695
01:53:07,664 --> 01:53:11,504
* Every time *

1696
01:53:11,664 --> 01:53:16,023
* We say goodbye *

1697
01:53:16,182 --> 01:53:20,023
* I die a little *

1698
01:53:21,381 --> 01:53:24,979
* Every time *

1699
01:53:25,140 --> 01:53:29,098
* We say goodbye *

1700
01:53:29,258 --> 01:53:32,817
* I wonder why *

1701
01:53:32,976 --> 01:53:35,296
* A little *

1702
01:53:35,455 --> 01:53:37,255
* Why the gods *

1703
01:53:37,414 --> 01:53:40,694
* Above me *

1704
01:53:40,855 --> 01:53:46,332
* Who must be in the know *

1705
01:53:49,770 --> 01:53:53,090
* Think so little of me *

1706
01:53:53,250 --> 01:53:58,168
- Take care of yourself.
- Yeah, I will. You too.

1707
01:53:58,328 --> 01:54:01,246
* They allow you to go *

1708
01:54:01,405 --> 01:54:05,364
* And when you're near *

1709
01:54:07,884 --> 01:54:11,203
* There sits an air *

1710
01:54:11,362 --> 01:54:14,400
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1711
01:54:14,561 --> 01:54:16,401
* Of spring about it *

1712
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:21,359
* I can hear *

1713
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:26,236
* A lark somewhere *

1714
01:54:26,395 --> 01:54:30,276
* Begin to sing *

1715
01:54:30,435 --> 01:54:32,834
* About it *

1716
01:54:32,994 --> 01:54:35,195
* There's no love *

1717
01:54:35,354 --> 01:54:38,233
* So finer *

1718
01:54:38,392 --> 01:54:41,831
* But how strange
the change *

1719
01:54:41,990 --> 01:54:44,670
* You made *

1720
01:54:44,830 --> 01:54:46,950
* Your mind up *

1721
01:54:47,109 --> 01:54:48,868
* Every time *

1722
01:54:50,947 --> 01:54:53,667
* We say goodbye **

1723
01:55:09,982 --> 01:55:12,940
Hello.
We're home.

1724
01:55:13,101 --> 01:55:17,019
- Grandfather?
- I'll check the study.

1725
01:55:23,058 --> 01:55:24,816
Hey, stranger.

1726
01:55:28,056 --> 01:55:31,693
Hey, Mom, did you know the Concorde
gets you here in half the time?

1727
01:55:31,853 --> 01:55:34,493
Yes, I-I've heard that.

1728
01:55:36,530 --> 01:55:39,090
Huh!
What are you doing here?

1729
01:55:39,209 --> 01:55:42,090
It took us around 30 seconds
after you guys left...

1730
01:55:42,251 --> 01:55:44,448
for us to realize we didn't
want to lose you two again.

1731
01:55:44,609 --> 01:55:47,048
We?

1732
01:55:50,045 --> 01:55:51,844
We.

1733
01:55:54,085 --> 01:55:56,763
I made the mistake of not coming
after you once, Lizzy.

1734
01:55:56,924 --> 01:56:01,242
I'm not going to do that again
no matter how brave you are.

1735
01:56:01,402 --> 01:56:05,441
And I suppose you just expect
me to go weak at the knees...

1736
01:56:05,601 --> 01:56:08,319
and fall into your arms
and cry hysterically...

1737
01:56:08,479 --> 01:56:11,999
and say we'll just figure this whole
thing out-- a bicontinental relationship...

1738
01:56:12,159 --> 01:56:16,195
with our daughters being raised
here an-and there and...

1739
01:56:16,356 --> 01:56:21,874
and you and I just... picking up
where we left off, and--

1740
01:56:22,035 --> 01:56:24,833
and growing old
together and--

1741
01:56:24,994 --> 01:56:26,753
and--

1742
01:56:26,913 --> 01:56:30,033
Come on, Nick.
What do you expect?

1743
01:56:30,192 --> 01:56:33,191
- To live happily ever after?
- Yes...

1744
01:56:33,350 --> 01:56:35,151
to all the above.

1745
01:56:35,311 --> 01:56:37,390
Except you don't have
to cry hysterically.

1746
01:56:39,228 --> 01:56:40,987
Oh, yes, I do.

1747
01:57:17,054 --> 01:57:20,374
We actually did it.

1748
01:57:21,373 --> 01:57:23,652
* This will be
an everlasting love *

1749
01:57:23,813 --> 01:57:27,291
* This will be
the one I've waited for *

1750
01:57:27,451 --> 01:57:30,531
* This will be
the first time *

1751
01:57:30,689 --> 01:57:34,287
* Anyone has loved me *

1752
01:57:34,447 --> 01:57:37,927
* I'm so glad
you found me in time *

1753
01:57:38,087 --> 01:57:41,606
* And I'm so glad that
you rectified my mind *

1754
01:57:41,765 --> 01:57:45,284
* This will be
an everlasting love *

1755
01:57:45,444 --> 01:57:48,964
* For me
Yeah, whoa-oa *

1756
01:57:49,123 --> 01:57:53,161
* Loving you
is some kind of wonderful *

1757
01:57:53,320 --> 01:57:57,000
* Because you've shown me
just how much you care *

1758
01:57:57,160 --> 01:58:00,279
* You've given me
the thrill of a lifetime *

1759
01:58:00,439 --> 01:58:04,197
* And made me believe you've got
more thrills to spare, oh *

1760
01:58:04,357 --> 01:58:08,876
* This will be
an everlasting love *

1761
01:58:09,035 --> 01:58:11,754
* Oh, yes, it will now *

1762
01:58:15,433 --> 01:58:18,793
* You've brought a lot
of sunshine into my life *

1763
01:58:18,952 --> 01:58:22,430
* You've filled me
with happiness I never knew *

1764
01:58:22,590 --> 01:58:25,470
* You gave me more joy
than I ever dreamed of *

1765
01:58:25,629 --> 01:58:29,547
* And no one, no one
can take the place of you *

1766
01:58:29,707 --> 01:58:33,027
* This will be you and me *

1767
01:58:33,188 --> 01:58:36,265
* Yes, sirree, eternally *

1768
01:58:36,425 --> 01:58:38,225
* Hugging and squeezing
and kissing and pleasing *

1769
01:58:38,385 --> 01:58:40,463
* Together forever
Through rain and whatever *

1770
01:58:40,623 --> 01:58:43,664
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You and me *

1771
01:58:43,823 --> 01:58:45,822
* So long as I'm living
true love I'll be giving *

1772
01:58:45,983 --> 01:58:47,860
* To you I'll be serving
'cause you're so deserving *

1773
01:58:48,021 --> 01:58:50,499
* Hey, you're so deserving *

1774
01:58:50,660 --> 01:58:54,297
* From now on
From now on, yeah *

1775
01:58:54,458 --> 01:58:57,978
* From now on
From now on *

1776
01:58:58,137 --> 01:59:00,055
* From now on **
