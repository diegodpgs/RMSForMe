2
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:03,562
I knew Harvey Dent.

3
00:01:04,577 --> 00:01:05,913
I was his friend.

4
00:01:08,389 --> 00:01:14,419
And it will be a very long time
before someone inspires us the way he did.

5
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:18,848
I believed in Harvey Dent.

6
00:01:37,852 --> 00:01:40,194
Dr. Pavel... I'm CIA.

7
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:41,642
He wasn't alone.

8
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,039
- Uh... You don't get to bring friends.
- They are not my friends.

9
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,395
Don't worry, no charge for them.

10
00:01:48,395 --> 00:01:52,017
- And why would I want them?
- They were trying to grab your prize.

11
00:01:52,355 --> 00:01:54,281
They work for the mercenary.

12
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:55,999
The masked man.

13
00:01:56,661 --> 00:01:59,013
- Bane?
- Aye.

14
00:01:59,724 --> 00:02:01,778
Get 'em on board. I'll call it in.

15
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,882
The flight plan I just filed
with the agency...

16
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,521
lists me, my men, Dr. Pavel here...

17
00:02:16,772 --> 00:02:18,857
but only one... of you!

18
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:26,392
First one to talk
gets to stay on my aircraft!

19
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:36,923
Who paid you to grab Dr. Pavel?

20
00:02:42,281 --> 00:02:44,261
He didn't fly so good!

21
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,540
Who wants to try next?

22
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,358
Tell me about Bane!
Why does he wear the mask?

23
00:02:53,898 --> 00:02:55,966
A lot o' loyalty for a hired gun!

24
00:02:56,263 --> 00:02:59,416
Well, perhaps he's wonderin'
why someone would shoot a man...

25
00:03:00,148 --> 00:03:02,686
before throwing him out of a plane.

26
00:03:07,273 --> 00:03:08,906
At least you can talk.

27
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:12,626
- Who are you?
- It doesn't matter who we are.

28
00:03:13,364 --> 00:03:15,593
What matters is our plan.

29
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:25,461
No one cared who I was
till I put on the mask.

30
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:29,004
If I pull that off, will you die?

31
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:32,546
- It would be extremely painful.
- You're a big guy.

32
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:33,745
For you.

33
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,895
- Was getting caught part of your plan?
- Of course.

34
00:03:46,774 --> 00:03:50,260
Dr. Pavel refused our offer
in favor of yours.

35
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,068
- We had to find out what he told you...
- Nothing. I said nothing.

36
00:04:07,294 --> 00:04:10,903
Well, congratulations!
You got yourself caught.

37
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:14,555
- Sir?
- Now what's the next step of your masterplan?

38
00:04:15,283 --> 00:04:16,797
Crashing this plane...

39
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,944
with no survivors!

40
00:04:47,093 --> 00:04:48,168
Mayday, Mayday!
Mayday...

41
00:05:35,777 --> 00:05:37,988
What you doin' to me?
Let me out!

42
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:41,831
No!

43
00:05:42,673 --> 00:05:44,640
No, no, no! No!

44
00:05:55,864 --> 00:05:58,987
No! They expect one of us
in the wreckage, brother.

45
00:06:00,974 --> 00:06:02,506
Have we started the fire?

46
00:06:02,665 --> 00:06:05,660
Yes. Fhe fire rises.

47
00:06:15,063 --> 00:06:18,470
Calm down, doctor.
Now is not the time for fear.

48
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,825
That comes later.

49
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,243
Harvey Dent Day
may not be our oldest public holiday,

50
00:06:51,596 --> 00:06:54,653
but we're here tonight
because it's one of the most important.

51
00:06:54,954 --> 00:06:58,997
Harvey Dent's uncompromising stand
against organized crime

52
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:03,326
had made Gotham a safer place than it was
at the time of his death, eight years ago.

53
00:07:03,326 --> 00:07:06,322
This city has seen a historic turnaround.

54
00:07:06,823 --> 00:07:12,024
No city is without crime, but this city is
without organized crime because the Dent Act

55
00:07:12,024 --> 00:07:15,671
gave law enforcement
teeth in its fight against the mob.

56
00:07:15,671 --> 00:07:19,301
Now,  people are talking about
repealing the Dent Act

57
00:07:19,456 --> 00:07:22,718
and to them I say
"Not on my watch".

58
00:07:24,131 --> 00:07:26,786
I wanna thank the Wayne Foundation
for hosting this event.

59
00:07:26,786 --> 00:07:31,167
I'm told Mr. Wayne couldn't be here tonight.
I'm sure he's with us in spirit.

60
00:07:31,225 --> 00:07:33,877
And now I'm gonna... give way
to an important voice....

61
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:36,472
You ever lay eyes on Wayne
at one of these things?

62
00:07:36,472 --> 00:07:38,475
No one has. Not in years.

63
00:07:38,595 --> 00:07:42,680
... people put their faith
in a murderous thug in a mask and a cape.

64
00:07:42,715 --> 00:07:45,970
A thug who showed his true nature...

65
00:07:46,374 --> 00:07:48,535
when he betrayed the trust
of this great man...

66
00:07:49,957 --> 00:07:51,655
and murdered 'im in cold blood.

67
00:07:52,182 --> 00:07:54,633
Sweetheart!
Not so fast with the chow.

68
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:55,873
- Shrimp balls?
- Jim Gordon...

69
00:07:56,078 --> 00:07:56,685
Thank you.

70
00:07:56,685 --> 00:08:00,511
... can tell you the truth about Harvey Dent.
He could... But I-I'll let 'im tell you himself.

71
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,896
Commissioner Gordon!

72
00:08:11,476 --> 00:08:12,503
The truth?

73
00:08:17,732 --> 00:08:18,746
I have...

74
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,570
written a speech...

75
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:25,708
telling the truth about Harvey Dent.

76
00:08:30,915 --> 00:08:32,970
Maybe the time isn't right.

77
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,419
Maybe right now...

78
00:08:39,655 --> 00:08:41,987
all you need to know is
that there are...

79
00:08:43,077 --> 00:08:47,311
1,000 inmates in Blackgate Prison
as a direct result of the Dent Act.

80
00:08:47,311 --> 00:08:52,182
These are violent criminals, essential... cogs
in the organized-crime machine.

81
00:08:52,536 --> 00:08:56,808
Maybe, for now, all I should say
about the death of Harvey Dent is this...

82
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,511
it has not been for nothing.

83
00:09:05,257 --> 00:09:07,712
- Did you see the guy who owns the house?
- No. You know, I heard

84
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,988
- he never leaves the east wing.
- You know, I heard he had an accident.

85
00:09:11,103 --> 00:09:13,917
- Yeah, that he's disfigured. He has to wear a...
- Mr. Till!

86
00:09:15,203 --> 00:09:18,663
Why are your people
using the main staircase?

87
00:09:19,423 --> 00:09:20,952
And where's Mrs. Bolton?

88
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,964
Uh, she's at the bar, sir.
Can I help?

89
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,397
The east drawing room.

90
00:09:25,777 --> 00:09:31,006
Unlock the door, put the tray on the table,
lock the door again. Nothing more.

91
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,433
I'm sorry, Miss Tate.
I tried, but he won't see you.

92
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:39,604
And you know,
you mustn't take it personally.

93
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:43,331
Everyone knows that Wayne's holed up
in there with 8-inch nails,

94
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,479
peeing into Mason jars...

95
00:09:45,566 --> 00:09:47,632
It's very good of you
to let me on the ground.

96
00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:03,647
Why are you wasting your time
trying to talk to a man

97
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:08,631
who threw away your investment
on some save-the-world vanity project?

98
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,870
He can't get your money back.
I can.

99
00:10:11,601 --> 00:10:15,902
I could try explaining that
a save-the-world project, vain or not,

100
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,680
is worth investing in, Mr. Daggett.

101
00:10:18,715 --> 00:10:21,953
But you understand only money
and the power you think it buys,

102
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:25,003
so, why waste my time... indeed?

103
00:10:25,672 --> 00:10:27,187
Second shift reports in?

104
00:10:27,187 --> 00:10:29,210
You should spend some more time
with the mayor.

105
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,085
Well, that's your department.

106
00:10:32,013 --> 00:10:34,049
Anyone shown him the crime stats?

107
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,510
He goes by his gut and it continues to bother 'im,
no matter what the numbers.

108
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:39,142
Must be popular with his wife.

109
00:10:39,142 --> 00:10:41,914
Not really.
She took the kids and left for Cleveland.

110
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:45,638
He'll have plenty o' time for visits.
The mayor's gonna dump 'im in the spring.

111
00:10:46,276 --> 00:10:47,998
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

112
00:10:47,998 --> 00:10:51,483
- But he's a hero.
- A war hero. This is peacetime.

113
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:25,626
Oh! Sorry, sorry.
I'm so terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne.

114
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:29,729
It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

115
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:36,870
Although you don't have the long nails
or... the facial scars, sir.

116
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,151
That what they say about me?

117
00:11:40,877 --> 00:11:43,793
It's just that no... no one ever sees you.

118
00:11:44,164 --> 00:11:48,149
That's a beautiful necklace. Reminds me
of one that belonged to my mother.

119
00:11:48,253 --> 00:11:50,471
It can't be the same one...

120
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:54,826
cause her pearls are in this safe...

121
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,753
the manufacturer clearly explained...

122
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:03,811
is uncrackable.

123
00:12:09,043 --> 00:12:10,017
Oops.

124
00:12:10,944 --> 00:12:13,322
Nobody told me it was uncrackable.

125
00:12:14,864 --> 00:12:17,216
I'm afraid
I can't let you take those.

126
00:12:17,897 --> 00:12:21,704
Look, you wouldn't beat up a woman
any more than I would beat up a cripple.

127
00:12:23,105 --> 00:12:26,220
Of course... sometimes
exceptions have to be made.

128
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:33,408
Good night, Mr. Wayne.

129
00:12:48,814 --> 00:12:50,247
Can I have a ride?

130
00:12:50,607 --> 00:12:52,058
You read my mind.

131
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:53,734
Let's go.

132
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:58,815
- Miss Tate was asking to see you again.
- She's very persistent.

133
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,423
And quite lovely,
in case you were wondering.

134
00:13:01,423 --> 00:13:03,719
- I wasn't.
- What are you doing?

135
00:13:03,748 --> 00:13:07,174
Examining print dust.
We've been robbed.

136
00:13:07,174 --> 00:13:10,401
And this is your idea
of, uh, sounding the alarm, is it?

137
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:12,542
She took the pearls,
tracking device and all.

138
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,195
- "She"?
- One o' the maids.

139
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,456
Perhaps you should stop lettin' em
in this side of the house.

140
00:13:16,456 --> 00:13:19,571
Perhaps you should start learning
to make your own bed.

141
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,139
- Why were you dusting for prints?
- I wasn't.

142
00:13:24,332 --> 00:13:25,452
She was.

143
00:13:29,213 --> 00:13:32,381
Sir. Congressman Gilly's wife
has been calling in.

144
00:13:32,381 --> 00:13:35,652
Apparently, the Congressman never made it home
after the Wayne Foundation event.

145
00:13:36,945 --> 00:13:38,753
That's a job for the police?

146
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:41,433
When you and Dent cleaned up the streets,
you cleaned them good.

147
00:13:41,673 --> 00:13:45,668
And pretty soon we'll be chasing down, uh,
overdue library books.

148
00:13:47,234 --> 00:13:51,658
And yet, here you are,
like we're still at war.

149
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,542
- What's your name, son?
- Blake, sir.

150
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,885
You have something
you wanna ask me, officer Blake?

151
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:03,471
It's about that night. This night,
eight years ago. The night Dent died.

152
00:14:03,471 --> 00:14:05,409
The last confirmed sighting of the Batman.

153
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:08,863
He murders those people,
takes down two SWAT teams,

154
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:12,453
breaks Dent's neck
and then just... vanishes?

155
00:14:12,981 --> 00:14:15,021
I'm not hearing a question, son.

156
00:14:15,566 --> 00:14:17,209
Don't you wanna know who he was?

157
00:14:18,351 --> 00:14:20,709
I know exactly who he was.

158
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,312
He was the Batman.

159
00:14:27,051 --> 00:14:29,332
Let's go see
about the Congressman's wife.

160
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,136
Master Wayne?

161
00:14:41,816 --> 00:14:43,096
Master Wayne?

162
00:15:14,797 --> 00:15:16,692
You haven't been down here
in a long time.

163
00:15:16,692 --> 00:15:20,777
Trying to find out more about
our jewel thief. I ran her... prints.

164
00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:23,082
Unless she's lost a lot o' weight...

165
00:15:24,016 --> 00:15:26,132
she was wearing
someone else's fingerprints.

166
00:15:26,454 --> 00:15:27,425
She's... good.

167
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,977
She may be, but we have a trace
on the necklace.

168
00:15:30,977 --> 00:15:34,059
We do. So, I cross-referenced
the address she went back to...

169
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:38,132
with police data
on high-end B and E's, and, um....

170
00:15:38,403 --> 00:15:40,095
Selina Kyle.

171
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:45,211
Databases are full of close-calls...
tips from fences...

172
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:49,422
She's good, but the ground
is shrinking beneath her feet.

173
00:15:49,426 --> 00:15:52,311
We should send the police
before she fences the pearls.

174
00:15:52,346 --> 00:15:54,630
She won't.
She likes them too much.

175
00:15:54,665 --> 00:15:56,694
And they weren't
what she was after.

176
00:15:56,694 --> 00:15:58,964
- What was she after?
- My fingerprints.

177
00:15:58,964 --> 00:16:01,943
It was printer toner
mixed with graphite on the safe.

178
00:16:02,214 --> 00:16:04,856
It gives a good pull
and it's untraceable.

179
00:16:04,891 --> 00:16:07,548
Fascinating. You two should exchange
notes over coffee.

180
00:16:07,781 --> 00:16:09,904
So, now you're tryin'
to set me up with a jewel thief...

181
00:16:09,904 --> 00:16:14,235
At this point, I'd set you up with a chimpanzee,
if it brought you back to the world.

182
00:16:14,938 --> 00:16:18,837
- There's nothing out there for me.
- And that's the problem.

183
00:16:19,122 --> 00:16:21,521
You hung up your cape and your cowl,
but you didn't move on.

184
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,347
You never went to find a life.

185
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:25,365
- To find someone.
- Alfred...

186
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,857
- I did find someone.
- I know, and you lost them.

187
00:16:29,994 --> 00:16:31,786
But that's all part of living, sir.

188
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:36,159
But you're not living, you're just waiting,
hoping for things to go bad again.

189
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,996
Remember when you left Gotham?

190
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,968
Before all this, before Batman?

191
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:42,959
You were gone seven years.

192
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:47,429
Seven years I waited,
hoping that you wouldn't come back.

193
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:51,361
Every year, I took a holiday.
I-I went to Florence.

194
00:16:51,361 --> 00:16:53,928
There's this cafe
on the banks of the Arno.

195
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,626
Every fine evening I'd sit there
and order a Fernet Branca.

196
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,086
I had this fantasy...

197
00:17:01,717 --> 00:17:04,060
that I would look across the tables...

198
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,472
and I'd see you there, with a... wife.

199
00:17:08,774 --> 00:17:10,984
Maybe, uh, a couple o' kids.

200
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:16,168
You wouldn't say anything to me,
nor me to you.

201
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:21,214
But we'd both know...
that you'd made it.

202
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:23,805
That you were happy.

203
00:17:26,867 --> 00:17:30,524
I never wanted you...
to come back to Gotham.

204
00:17:31,765 --> 00:17:36,328
I always knew there was nothing here
for you, except pain... and tragedy.

205
00:17:36,371 --> 00:17:39,180
And I wanted something
more for you than that.

206
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:45,628
I still do.

207
00:17:49,997 --> 00:17:52,595
They wash up here
a couple o' times a month.

208
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:54,442
And more when it gets colder.

209
00:17:54,477 --> 00:17:56,443
Homeless,
sheltering in the tunnels.

210
00:17:58,132 --> 00:18:02,225
Uh, we pulled 'im from the basin,
but other than that we didn't touch 'im.

211
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:07,938
- What?
- Name's Jimmy. He's from St. Swithin's.

212
00:18:08,481 --> 00:18:12,126
It's the boys' home
where I... coach some ball.

213
00:18:15,242 --> 00:18:16,719
Jimmy hadn't been around for months.

214
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,099
- No? Why?
- Blake, you know why.

215
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:23,623
He aged out. We don't have the resources
to keep boys on after 16.

216
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:25,916
Yeah, look, I thought the Wayne Foundation
gave money for that.

217
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:27,729
Not for the past couple o' years.

218
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:32,215
- He has a brother here, doesn't he?
- Mark. I'll tell 'im.

219
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,133
I'd like to... if that's all right.

220
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,330
You know what he was doing
down there in the tunnels?

221
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,266
Lot of guys been goin' down the tunnels
when they age out.

222
00:18:44,836 --> 00:18:46,774
Say you can live down there.

223
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:50,305
- Say there's work down there.
- Work?

224
00:18:51,022 --> 00:18:53,163
What kinda work
are you gonna find in the sewers?

225
00:18:53,874 --> 00:18:56,359
More than you can find up here,
I guess.

226
00:18:57,349 --> 00:19:00,299
- So, you know about him?
- Course.

227
00:19:01,761 --> 00:19:03,749
Do you think he's comin' back?

228
00:19:05,815 --> 00:19:06,945
I don't know.

229
00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:22,314
You brought a date?

230
00:19:22,721 --> 00:19:25,592
I like having someone around
to open doors for me.

231
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,268
Right hand. No partials.

232
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,344
- Very nice.
- Mm-hm.

233
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:41,147
Not so fast, handsome.
You got somethin' for me?

234
00:19:42,322 --> 00:19:43,377
Ah, yes.

235
00:19:53,431 --> 00:19:56,319
I don't know what you're planning
to do with Mr. Wayne's prints,

236
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:59,893
but... I'm guessing
you'll need his thumb.

237
00:20:00,346 --> 00:20:04,110
- You don't count so good, huh?
- I count fine.

238
00:20:04,145 --> 00:20:07,265
In fact,
I'm counting to 10... right now.

239
00:20:09,818 --> 00:20:10,878
Okay.

240
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:17,459
My friend's outside.
Just... hit "Send".

241
00:20:29,455 --> 00:20:33,474
- This place is a little dead.
- It'll liven up in a minute. Trust me.

242
00:20:35,787 --> 00:20:38,911
- Is everything okay?
- Great. Catch you later.

243
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:44,663
Hm.

244
00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:47,724
It would have been a lot easier...

245
00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:50,583
to just give me what we agreed.

246
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,833
We can't have loose ends.

247
00:20:53,229 --> 00:20:57,285
And even in that dress,
no one's gonna miss you.

248
00:20:57,413 --> 00:20:58,277
No.

249
00:20:58,822 --> 00:21:03,570
But my friend over there?
Every cop in the city's missing him.

250
00:21:04,292 --> 00:21:05,375
That's cute.

251
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:08,727
But... they're not gonna
be looking in a place like this.

252
00:21:08,762 --> 00:21:11,814
I don't know.
You did just use his cell phone.

253
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:22,947
- Go!
- Go!

254
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,829
Police! Get down now!

255
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,344
Help me! Help me!

256
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,555
Help me, please! Please, help me!

257
00:21:58,145 --> 00:22:00,046
Keep some pressure on that,
sweetheart.

258
00:22:03,209 --> 00:22:04,248
Call me?

259
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,816
- You okay, miss?
- He's bleeding. You gotta help 'im.

260
00:22:14,684 --> 00:22:16,066
I got the Congressman.

261
00:22:44,895 --> 00:22:45,614
Clear!

262
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:54,047
Manhole! Get this up!
Get the DWP down here!

263
00:22:55,196 --> 00:22:56,540
You three, down with me.

264
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:00,563
You two, you go down,
cover the next exit!

265
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,145
What, they went down there?

266
00:23:49,787 --> 00:23:53,048
- We're gonna go down there, right?
- That was a gas explosion, kid.

267
00:23:53,063 --> 00:23:56,538
- Wasn't gas. It's a sewer.
- No one goes in there till we know what's down there.

268
00:23:56,573 --> 00:23:58,411
We know what's down there, sir.
The police commissioner.

269
00:23:58,713 --> 00:24:00,187
Someone get this hothead outta here?

270
00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:02,713
And where's that DWP guy?

271
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,792
Why are you here?

272
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,715
Answer him.

273
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,387
I was asking you.

274
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,494
It's the police commissioner.

275
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:02,906
And you brought him down here?

276
00:25:03,353 --> 00:25:06,231
- We didn't know what to do. We just thought...
- You panicked.

277
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:09,501
And your weakness has cost the lives
of three others.

278
00:25:09,536 --> 00:25:11,034
No, he-he's alone.

279
00:25:14,823 --> 00:25:17,899
Search him.
Then I will kill you.

280
00:25:47,467 --> 00:25:50,364
- He's dead.
- So, show me his body.

281
00:25:50,595 --> 00:25:53,923
The water runs to any one of the outflows.
We'll never find 'im.

282
00:26:00,012 --> 00:26:02,358
- Follow him!
- Follow him?

283
00:26:17,991 --> 00:26:21,819
You okay? You okay?
Hey! Hey! You awake?

284
00:26:28,363 --> 00:26:29,773
I need to see Bruce Wayne.

285
00:26:29,904 --> 00:26:32,506
I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't take
unscheduled calls.

286
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,554
Even from a police officer.

287
00:26:34,822 --> 00:26:38,304
And if I go get a warrant for
the investigation of Harvey Dent's murder?

288
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:40,335
That still count as unscheduled?

289
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,981
What can I do for you, officer?

290
00:26:47,449 --> 00:26:49,291
Commissioner Gordon's been shot.

291
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,694
He chased a gunman
down into the sewers.

292
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:57,344
When I pulled 'im out, he was babblin'
about an underground army.

293
00:26:57,593 --> 00:26:59,560
A masked man called Bane.

294
00:27:00,447 --> 00:27:02,429
Well, shouldn't you be telling
your superior officers about this?

295
00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:05,642
They asked me if he saw
any giant alligators.

296
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,791
He needs you.

297
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,112
He needs the Batman.

298
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:15,854
- If Commissioner Gordon thinks...
- Oh, he doesn't know or care who you are.

299
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,873
But we've met before.

300
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:23,861
It was a long time ago.
I was a kid. Uh... St. Swithin's?

301
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:28,592
It used to be funded by
the Wayne Foundation. It's an orphanage.

302
00:27:29,736 --> 00:27:33,653
My mom died when I was small. It was
a car accident, I don't really remember it.

303
00:27:34,608 --> 00:27:39,052
But... my dad got shot a couple years later
over a gambling debt...

304
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:43,335
and I remember that one... just fine.

305
00:27:44,557 --> 00:27:47,552
Not a lot o' people know
what it feels like, do they?

306
00:27:47,935 --> 00:27:49,233
To be angry...

307
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,778
in your bones...

308
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:58,826
I mean, they understand.
Foster parents.

309
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,790
Everybody understands...

310
00:28:01,323 --> 00:28:02,531
for a while.

311
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,036
And then they want the angry little kid
to do something he knows he can't do.

312
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,192
Move on.

313
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:11,313
So, after a while,
they stop understanding.

314
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,810
They send the angry kid
to a boys' home.

315
00:28:13,845 --> 00:28:17,528
I figured it out too late.
You gotta learn to hide the anger.

316
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:20,572
Practice smiling in a mirror.

317
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,249
It's like puttin' on a mask.

318
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:28,796
So, you showed up this one day,
in a cool car.

319
00:28:29,032 --> 00:28:30,546
Pretty girl on your arm.

320
00:28:31,863 --> 00:28:33,538
We were so excited.

321
00:28:33,941 --> 00:28:36,750
Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphan?

322
00:28:37,068 --> 00:28:40,680
I mean, we used to make up stories
about you, man. Legends.

323
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,271
And, you know, with the other kids,
that's all it was, just stories, but....

324
00:28:46,484 --> 00:28:48,916
Right when I saw you,
I knew who you really were.

325
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:52,793
I'd seen that look on your face before.

326
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,973
It's the same one I taught myself.

327
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,614
I don't know why you took the fall
for Dent's murder...

328
00:29:01,841 --> 00:29:04,012
but I'm still a believer in the Batman...

329
00:29:04,733 --> 00:29:06,220
even if you're not.

330
00:29:09,129 --> 00:29:14,163
Why did you say that your boys' home
used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation?

331
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,753
Because the money stopped.

332
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,835
Might be time to get some fresh air.
Start payin' attention to the details.

333
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,640
Some o' those details
might need your help.

334
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,513
You check that name? Bane?

335
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:29,349
He's a mercenary.
No other known names.

336
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,977
Him and his men were behind
a coup in West Africa...

337
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:36,678
that secured mining operations
for our friend John Daggett.

338
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:40,642
- Now Daggett's brought 'em here.
- Or so it seems.

339
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,392
- I'll keep digging.
- Yeah.

340
00:29:45,663 --> 00:29:51,794
Alfred! Why did the Wayne Foundation
stop funding boys' homes in the city?

341
00:29:52,277 --> 00:29:57,270
The foundation is funded by
the profits of Wayne Enterprises.

342
00:29:57,505 --> 00:29:59,195
There have to be some.

343
00:29:59,327 --> 00:30:02,424
- Time to talk to Mr. Fox, I think.
- I'll get 'im on the phone.

344
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:06,056
No, no, no, no, no. Do we still have
any cars... around the place?

345
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:08,639
Yes. One or two.

346
00:30:08,855 --> 00:30:10,808
I need an appointment
at the hospital for my leg.

347
00:30:10,956 --> 00:30:14,054
- Which hospital?
- Whichever one Jim Gordon's in.

348
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:21,350
-  I have seen worse cartilage in knees.
- That's good.

349
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,941
No. That's because
there is no cartilage in your knee,

350
00:30:23,976 --> 00:30:27,467
and not much of any use
in your elbows or your shoulders.

351
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,618
Between that and the scar tissue
on your kidneys,

352
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,640
the residual concussive damage
to your brain tissue

353
00:30:32,675 --> 00:30:35,290
and the general scarred-over quality
of your body,

354
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,994
I cannot recommend
that you go heli-skiing, Mr. Wayne.

355
00:30:38,175 --> 00:30:39,028
Right.

356
00:30:53,927 --> 00:30:56,036
We were in this together...

357
00:30:58,692 --> 00:31:00,300
then you were gone.

358
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:02,655
The Batman wasn't needed anymore.

359
00:31:02,773 --> 00:31:05,612
- We won.
- Based on a lie.

360
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:12,729
And now there's evil
rising from where we tried to bury it.

361
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:20,383
- The Batman... has to come back.
- What if he doesn't exist anymore?

362
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:22,273
He must.

363
00:31:38,235 --> 00:31:40,050
You took my goddamn wallet,
didn't you?

364
00:31:40,085 --> 00:31:42,321
- You f... You took my wallet!
- No, I...

365
00:31:43,555 --> 00:31:45,737
- Get out.
-  She took my... Ah!

366
00:31:46,214 --> 00:31:48,738
- Now.
- Creep!

367
00:31:48,819 --> 00:31:51,408
I don't know what he's so upset about.
There's only 60 bucks in here.

368
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,021
Probably the watch.

369
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:09,154
Who's that?

370
00:32:09,154 --> 00:32:11,655
Another stiff can barely
climb out of his sports car.

371
00:32:12,282 --> 00:32:14,619
- No, that's Bruce Wayne!
- Mr. Wayne, over here!

372
00:32:19,598 --> 00:32:21,901
- I'm not sure if my assistant...
- Right through here, Mr. Wayne.

373
00:32:21,901 --> 00:32:23,212
Thank you so much.

374
00:32:28,784 --> 00:32:32,359
Bruce Wayne... at a charity ball.

375
00:32:33,636 --> 00:32:35,390
Miss Tate, isn't it?

376
00:32:36,499 --> 00:32:39,830
Even before you became a recluse,
you never came to these things.

377
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:42,888
The proceeds go to the big fat spread.
It's not about charity.

378
00:32:42,888 --> 00:32:48,074
It's about feeding the ego
of... whichever society hag laid this on.

379
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:50,969
Actually,
this is my party, Mr. Wayne.

380
00:32:51,353 --> 00:32:52,247
Oh.

381
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:57,992
And the proceeds will go where they should,
because I paid for the big fat spread myself.

382
00:32:58,577 --> 00:33:00,024
That's very generous o' you.

383
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:03,836
You have to invest if you want
to restore balance to the world.

384
00:33:04,221 --> 00:33:06,065
Take our clean-energy project.

385
00:33:06,538 --> 00:33:08,911
Sometimes
the investment doesn't pay off.

386
00:33:09,933 --> 00:33:13,535
- I'm sorry.
- You have a practised apathy, Mr. Wayne.

387
00:33:13,696 --> 00:33:18,915
But a man who doesn't care about the world
doesn't spend half his fortune on a plan to save it.

388
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,762
And isn't so wounded when it fails...

389
00:33:23,311 --> 00:33:25,054
that he goes into hiding.

390
00:33:26,358 --> 00:33:28,357
Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne.

391
00:33:32,517 --> 00:33:33,762
You mind if I cut in?

392
00:33:35,294 --> 00:33:36,251
Thank you.

393
00:33:39,953 --> 00:33:42,936
- You don't seem happy to see me.
- You were supposed to be a shut-in.

394
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,803
I felt like some fresh air.

395
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:47,699
Why didn't you call the police?

396
00:33:51,264 --> 00:33:51,281
I have a powerful friend
who deals with things like this.

397
00:33:51,316 --> 00:33:55,523
That's a brazen costume for a...
cat burglar.

398
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,807
Yeah?
Who are you pretending to be?

399
00:33:58,939 --> 00:34:01,371
Bruce Wayne. Eccentric billionaire.

400
00:34:02,391 --> 00:34:04,560
- Who's your date?
- His wife's in Ibiza.

401
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:08,605
She left her diamonds behind, though.
Worried they might get stolen.

402
00:34:08,832 --> 00:34:10,740
It's pronounced "Ibiza".

403
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,943
You wouldn't want any o' these folks
realizing you're a crook, not a social climber.

404
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:18,185
You think I care what anyone
in this room thinks of me?

405
00:34:20,008 --> 00:34:22,184
I doubt you care what anyone
in any room thinks of you.

406
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:26,049
Don't condescend, Mr. Wayne.
You don't know a thing about me.

407
00:34:26,817 --> 00:34:30,901
Well, Selina Kyle... I know that you came here
from your walk-up in Old Town.

408
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,903
A modest place for a master jewel thief.

409
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,341
Which means that either
you're saving for retirement

410
00:34:35,341 --> 00:34:38,928
or... you're in deep
with the wrong people.

411
00:34:40,615 --> 00:34:41,877
You don't get to judge me

412
00:34:41,877 --> 00:34:44,648
just because you were born
in the master bedroom of Wayne Manor.

413
00:34:44,648 --> 00:34:48,604
- Actually, I was born in the Regency Room.
- I started out doing what I had to.

414
00:34:50,336 --> 00:34:53,677
Once you've done what you had to,
they never let you do what you want to.

415
00:34:53,712 --> 00:34:55,046
Start fresh.

416
00:34:55,228 --> 00:34:58,333
Ugh. There's no fresh start
in today's world.

417
00:34:58,615 --> 00:35:01,431
Any 12-year-old with a cell phone
could find out what you did.

418
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,782
Everything we do is collated
and quantified. Everything sticks.

419
00:35:05,968 --> 00:35:08,193
Is that how you justify stealing?

420
00:35:08,694 --> 00:35:10,951
I take what I need from those
who have more than enough.

421
00:35:10,951 --> 00:35:13,193
I don't stand on the shoulders
of people with less.

422
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,148
Robin Hood?

423
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,576
I think I'd do more to help someone
than most of the people in this room. Than you.

424
00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:21,995
You think maybe you're assuming
a little too much?

425
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:26,352
Maybe you're being unrealistic about
what's really in your pants other than your wallet.

426
00:35:26,352 --> 00:35:27,372
Ouch.

427
00:35:27,778 --> 00:35:32,638
You think all this can last?
There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne.

428
00:35:33,555 --> 00:35:37,721
You and your friends better batten down
the hatches, cause when it hits...

429
00:35:37,908 --> 00:35:41,881
you're all gonna wonder how
you ever thought you could live so large

430
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:44,784
and leave so little for the rest of us.

431
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:50,518
You sound like
you're looking forward to it.

432
00:35:52,336 --> 00:35:53,760
I'm adaptable.

433
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,242
Those pearls do look better on you
than they did in my safe.

434
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,925
But I still can't let you keep 'em.

435
00:36:07,527 --> 00:36:10,189
You... You...
You scared her off!

436
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,472
Not likely.

437
00:36:16,602 --> 00:36:17,883
Must have lost my ticket.

438
00:36:18,116 --> 00:36:20,917
- Your wife said you were taking a cab home.
- My wife?!

439
00:36:28,954 --> 00:36:30,000
Just you, sir?

440
00:36:33,488 --> 00:36:35,046
Don't worry, Master Wayne.

441
00:36:36,272 --> 00:36:39,208
Takes a little time to get back
in the swing of things.

442
00:36:41,816 --> 00:36:44,711
Bruce Wayne... as I live and breathe.

443
00:36:46,585 --> 00:36:49,016
What brings you out of cryo-sleep,
Mr. Wayne?

444
00:36:49,016 --> 00:36:50,665
I see
you haven't lost your sense of humor.

445
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:53,335
Even if you have lost...
most o' my money.

446
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,181
Actually, you did that.

447
00:36:55,216 --> 00:36:57,823
If you funnel
your entire R & D budget

448
00:36:57,823 --> 00:37:01,144
into a fusion project
that you then mothball,

449
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:04,739
- your company is unlikely to thrive.
- What are my options?

450
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:07,510
Well, if you're unwilling
to turn on the machine...

451
00:37:08,299 --> 00:37:12,041
- I can't. I can't, Lucius.
- Well, then sit tight.

452
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,195
Your majority keeps Daggett at bay,

453
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:18,495
while we figure out a future for
the energy program with Miranda Tate.

454
00:37:18,532 --> 00:37:21,245
She has supported the project
all the way.

455
00:37:21,525 --> 00:37:24,581
She's smart. And... quite lovely.

456
00:37:25,706 --> 00:37:28,459
We all just want
what's best for you, Bruce.

457
00:37:29,441 --> 00:37:30,932
Show her the machine.

458
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,719
- I'll think it over.
- Anything else?

459
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:37,089
Nope. Why?

460
00:37:37,554 --> 00:37:41,658
These conversations used to end
with an unusual request.

461
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,592
I retired.

462
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:47,660
Mm-hm. Well, let me show you
some stuff anyway.

463
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,049
Just for old times' sake.

464
00:37:58,245 --> 00:38:00,068
I figured you'd have
shut this place down.

465
00:38:00,413 --> 00:38:03,268
Oh, it was always shut down...
officially.

466
00:38:03,303 --> 00:38:04,155
All this new stuff.

467
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:08,952
After your father died, Wayne Enterprises
set up 14 different defense subsidiaries.

468
00:38:09,227 --> 00:38:11,788
For years, I've been shuttering
and consolidating

469
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,375
all the different prototypes
under one roof.

470
00:38:14,714 --> 00:38:16,125
- My roof.
- Why?

471
00:38:16,655 --> 00:38:19,134
Keep them from falling
into the wrong hands.

472
00:38:22,304 --> 00:38:24,222
Oh, now you're just showin' off.

473
00:38:25,773 --> 00:38:30,019
Defense Department projects
for tight geometry urban pacification.

474
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:35,136
Rotors are configured to maneuver
between buildings without recirculation.

475
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:37,112
What's it called?

476
00:38:38,126 --> 00:38:42,449
Oh, it has a long, uninteresting
Wayne Enterprises designation.

477
00:38:42,518 --> 00:38:45,247
I just took to calling it...
the Bat.

478
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,427
And, yes, Mr. Wayne,
it does come in black.

479
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,257
Works fine...
except for the autopilot.

480
00:38:54,607 --> 00:38:57,569
- Takes a better mind than mine to fix it.
- Better mind?

481
00:38:58,798 --> 00:39:01,421
Well... I was trying to be modest.

482
00:39:01,984 --> 00:39:03,584
A less busy mind.

483
00:39:04,272 --> 00:39:05,401
Yours.

484
00:39:13,189 --> 00:39:16,315
- Is it really painful?
- You're very welcome to try it, Alfred.

485
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,371
Happy watching. Thank you, sir.

486
00:39:21,774 --> 00:39:22,746
Not bad.

487
00:39:28,078 --> 00:39:29,416
Not bad at all.

488
00:39:32,955 --> 00:39:36,064
If you're seriously considering
going back out there,

489
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,208
you should hear the rumors
surrounding Bane.

490
00:39:38,698 --> 00:39:39,786
I'm all ears.

491
00:39:40,927 --> 00:39:44,229
There is a prison
in a more ancient part of the world.

492
00:39:45,114 --> 00:39:50,161
A pit... where men are thrown
to suffer and die.

493
00:39:50,281 --> 00:39:53,831
But sometimes
a man rises from the darkness.

494
00:39:54,189 --> 00:39:58,103
Sometimes
the pit sends something back.

495
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,580
- Bane.
- Bane.

496
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:04,088
Born and raised in hell on earth.

497
00:40:04,123 --> 00:40:07,791
- Born in a prison?
- No one knows why, or how he escaped.

498
00:40:07,791 --> 00:40:10,293
But they do know that once he did...

499
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:15,116
he was trained by Ra's Al Ghul,
your mentor.

500
00:40:15,286 --> 00:40:17,422
Bane was a member
of the League of Shadows...

501
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:19,794
And then...
he was excommunicated.

502
00:40:20,026 --> 00:40:25,763
And any man who is too extreme
for Ra's Al Ghul is not to be trifled with.

503
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:29,413
I didn't realize I was known
for trifling with criminals.

504
00:40:29,698 --> 00:40:30,831
That was then.

505
00:40:31,515 --> 00:40:34,575
And you can strap up your leg
and put your mask back on,

506
00:40:34,813 --> 00:40:36,840
but that doesn't make you
what you were.

507
00:40:37,246 --> 00:40:41,729
If this man is everything that you say he is,
then the city needs me.

508
00:40:42,097 --> 00:40:44,714
The city needs Bruce Wayne.

509
00:40:45,322 --> 00:40:47,423
Your resources, your knowledge.

510
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:50,393
It doesn't need your body,
or your life.

511
00:40:51,296 --> 00:40:52,365
That time's past.

512
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,910
You're afraid that, if I go back out there,
I'll fail.

513
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,216
No.

514
00:40:59,086 --> 00:41:01,791
I'm afraid that you want to.

515
00:41:16,395 --> 00:41:19,615
You can't short the stock because
Bruce Wayne goes to a party.

516
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:23,480
Wayne coming back is change.
Change is either good or bad. I vote bad.

517
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,343
- On what basis?
- I flipped a coin.

518
00:41:32,641 --> 00:41:34,824
Rye. It says rye.
I said no rye, man.

519
00:41:37,563 --> 00:41:40,851
Hey, rookie! Lose the helmet.
We need faces for camera.

520
00:41:46,323 --> 00:41:48,300
Come on. Let's go scalping.

521
00:42:03,662 --> 00:42:04,632
C'mon.

522
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,464
Everybody down, now!
Right now!

523
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:52,893
This is a stock exchange.
There's no money you can steal.

524
00:42:52,893 --> 00:42:56,107
Really?
Then why are you people here?

525
00:43:12,773 --> 00:43:15,258
Please, everybody, stay back!
Go down to the end of the block!

526
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,306
We have an emergency situation!

527
00:43:20,742 --> 00:43:22,265
You gotta get in there!

528
00:43:22,615 --> 00:43:24,153
This is a hostage situation.

529
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:28,153
No, no, no. This is a robbery. They have
direct access to the online trading desk.

530
00:43:28,153 --> 00:43:29,916
I'm not riskin' my men
for your money.

531
00:43:33,979 --> 00:43:36,346
Sir, we're gonna have to ask you
to move. We have a situation here.

532
00:43:36,486 --> 00:43:38,563
It's not our money,
it's everybody's.

533
00:43:38,598 --> 00:43:40,856
Really?
Mine's in my mattress.

534
00:43:41,011 --> 00:43:42,371
You don't put these guys down,

535
00:43:42,371 --> 00:43:45,404
that stuffing in your mattress
might be worth a whole helluva lot less.

536
00:43:45,547 --> 00:43:47,981
Cut the fiber cable
and take out that cell tower.

537
00:43:48,016 --> 00:43:49,988
- Thank you.
- That'll slow 'em down.

538
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:57,880
They cut the fiber.

539
00:43:59,299 --> 00:44:00,420
Cell's working.

540
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,763
For now.

541
00:44:07,708 --> 00:44:09,533
Get all these barriers up.
I want all of them up.

542
00:44:09,533 --> 00:44:11,212
No one gets in or out
o' any of these streets.

543
00:44:11,212 --> 00:44:12,916
- Where am I supposed to move it?
- Back it up.

544
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,800
All right,
just stay in your vehicle, okay?

545
00:44:27,981 --> 00:44:30,124
How much longer
does the program need?

546
00:44:31,946 --> 00:44:33,186
Eight minutes.

547
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:37,153
- Time to go mobile.
- Everybody, up!

548
00:44:41,434 --> 00:44:42,678
You two, move!

549
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:46,916
Thank you.

550
00:44:48,071 --> 00:44:48,878
Steady...

551
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,512
Steady!

552
00:45:07,668 --> 00:45:08,859
I've got something.

553
00:45:09,793 --> 00:45:12,032
Hold your fire,
they've got hostages.

554
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,367
Hold your fire!

555
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,541
Go, go!

556
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:39,950
Please! Just let me go!
Hey! Please! Hey!

557
00:45:42,508 --> 00:45:43,821
Shoot the tires.

558
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:45,262
There's no shot.

559
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:49,912
Now, back off.
Back off, they've got hostages.

560
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,623
<i> ... P.D. are pursuing
the four suspects through downtown,</i>

561
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,617
<i>in response to a hostage situation.
Gotham P.D...</i>

562
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,104
What's goin' on with the lights?

563
00:46:10,325 --> 00:46:11,590
It can't be.

564
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,144
What the hell was that?

565
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,541
Oh, boy, you are in
for a show tonight, son.

566
00:46:21,772 --> 00:46:24,366
Please! Help, help, help!

567
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:42,905
Sorry.

568
00:46:43,497 --> 00:46:46,469
Put that thing away
before you hurt yourself. Get in!

569
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,764
Let's go. You, get in the car!
They've spotted the Batman.

570
00:47:01,168 --> 00:47:04,594
Call everyone in. Every car patrol,
beat cop, off-duty too.

571
00:47:04,594 --> 00:47:07,514
Pull 'em in now! I'm gonna do
what Jim Gordon never could.

572
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:10,469
- What's that?
- I'm gonna take down the Batman.

573
00:47:11,026 --> 00:47:13,896
<i> ... are confirming four suspects
are carrying two hostages</i>

574
00:47:13,896 --> 00:47:16,345
<i>that were kidnapped
from the Gotham Stock Exchange.</i>

575
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,975
<i>- Reports from the eyewitnesses...
- Scott, look at that spot dead center o' your screen.</i>

576
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,743
<i>- What do you see?
- I see that Bat... Batman.</i>

577
00:47:21,743 --> 00:47:24,757
<i>Hard to believe, but the four suspects
are now being pursued</i>

578
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,800
<i>by what appears to be...
the Batman.</i>

579
00:47:27,365 --> 00:47:28,404
Well, what do you know?

580
00:47:33,412 --> 00:47:35,564
Sir, what about the armed robbers?

581
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:41,222
Please! Just let me go! Please!

582
00:47:50,504 --> 00:47:53,528
<i> One bike's pulled off.
No hostage. Should we pursue?</i>

583
00:47:58,656 --> 00:48:00,415
Negative. Stay on the Batman.

584
00:48:02,905 --> 00:48:04,683
- He's gettin' away.
- Who do you wanna catch, huh?

585
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:07,618
Some robber, or the son of a bitch
who killed Harvey Dent?

586
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:13,539
<i> ... the entire upper west hill,</i>

587
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,225
<i>Central Heights
and East Park Side areas.</i>

588
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:19,442
Eight years... he has to pick tonight.

589
00:48:19,712 --> 00:48:21,577
He's drawing the cops off Bane.

590
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,533
Please! Just let me go!

591
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,076
Please!

592
00:49:52,526 --> 00:49:53,736
<i>We lost 'im.</i>

593
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,651
How could you lose 'im?

594
00:49:55,928 --> 00:49:57,587
<i>He's got a lot of firepower.</i>

595
00:49:57,755 --> 00:49:59,067
What, and you don't?!

596
00:50:03,677 --> 00:50:05,122
<i>He's headin' back downtown.</i>

597
00:50:05,596 --> 00:50:07,736
Then he's as dumb as he dresses.

598
00:50:08,095 --> 00:50:09,545
Close it off, gentlemen.

599
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:44,479
Like a rat in a trap, gentlemen.

600
00:50:49,912 --> 00:50:52,809
You might have
the wrong animal there, sir.

601
00:51:03,763 --> 00:51:05,209
You sure it was 'im?

602
00:51:12,216 --> 00:51:15,571
Bane says the Batman interfered,
but the task was accomplished.

603
00:51:15,815 --> 00:51:17,556
What about the men they arrested?

604
00:51:17,681 --> 00:51:21,619
He said, and I quote,
"They would die before talking".

605
00:51:22,948 --> 00:51:25,135
Where does he find these guys?

606
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:28,494
Open the champagne.

607
00:51:30,701 --> 00:51:34,817
- And can we get some girls in here?
- Careful what you wish for.

608
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:48,465
- Cat got your tongue?
- You dumb bitch.

609
00:51:48,582 --> 00:51:50,778
Nobody ever accused me
of being dumb.

610
00:51:50,903 --> 00:51:53,624
You're dumb...
for comin' here tonight.

611
00:51:54,943 --> 00:51:57,043
I want what you owe me.

612
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,895
Want... doesn't get.

613
00:52:01,294 --> 00:52:04,854
Nice outfit.
Those heels make it tough to walk?

614
00:52:04,993 --> 00:52:05,944
I don't know.

615
00:52:07,248 --> 00:52:08,511
Do they?

616
00:52:09,859 --> 00:52:11,714
- So, where is it?
- Where is what?

617
00:52:11,714 --> 00:52:14,192
The program. The "clean slate".

618
00:52:14,336 --> 00:52:17,724
The ultimate tool for a master thief
with a record.

619
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,435
Hold it right there!

620
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:36,200
- Where is it?
- The clean slate?

621
00:52:36,585 --> 00:52:38,858
Where you type in someone's name,
date of birth,

622
00:52:39,344 --> 00:52:43,440
in a few minutes they're gone
from every database on earth?

623
00:52:44,167 --> 00:52:46,992
- Sound a little too good to be true?
- You're lying!

624
00:52:47,474 --> 00:52:51,353
- Rykin Data took it to prototype stage.
- That's why I bought 'em.

625
00:52:52,775 --> 00:52:54,190
But they had nothing.

626
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:56,912
It was a gangland myth.

627
00:53:07,979 --> 00:53:09,121
Stay back!

628
00:53:12,657 --> 00:53:14,137
I'm not bluffing!

629
00:53:15,241 --> 00:53:16,248
They know.

630
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:18,509
They just don't care.

631
00:53:35,964 --> 00:53:37,093
You gotta be kidding me.

632
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:39,842
- No guns. No killing.
- Where's the fun in that?

633
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:01,603
My mother warned me about
getting into cars with strange men.

634
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,163
This isn't a car.

635
00:54:53,126 --> 00:54:54,855
See you around.

636
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:56,866
You're welcome.

637
00:54:57,124 --> 00:55:00,154
- I had it under control.
- Those weren't street thugs.

638
00:55:00,481 --> 00:55:03,398
They were trained killers.
I saved your life.

639
00:55:04,285 --> 00:55:08,399
In return, I need to know
what you did with Bruce Wayne's fingerprints.

640
00:55:08,833 --> 00:55:11,486
Wayne wasn't kidding about
a powerful friend.

641
00:55:12,906 --> 00:55:15,055
I sold his prints to Daggett...

642
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:18,755
for something
that doesn't even exist.

643
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:23,114
- I doubt many people get the better of you.
- Hey, when a girl's desperate....

644
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:25,832
- What's he gonna do with them?
- I don't know,

645
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:29,076
but Daggett seemed pretty interested
in that mess at the stock market.

646
00:55:34,814 --> 00:55:35,856
Miss Kyle?

647
00:55:38,898 --> 00:55:41,022
So, that's what that feels like.

648
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,198
I see from the television coverage

649
00:56:02,198 --> 00:56:04,982
that you got your taste
for wanton destruction back.

650
00:56:05,164 --> 00:56:06,541
I retrieved this.

651
00:56:07,318 --> 00:56:09,573
Aren't the police supposed
to be investigating, then?

652
00:56:09,831 --> 00:56:13,160
- They don't have the tools to analyze it.
- They would if you gave them to them.

653
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:16,133
One man's tool...
is another man's weapon.

654
00:56:16,133 --> 00:56:19,333
In your mind, perhaps. But there aren't
many things you can't turn into a weapon.

655
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,627
Alfred, enough!
The police weren't gettin' it done.

656
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:25,509
Perhaps they might have...
if you hadn't made a sideshow of yourself.

657
00:56:25,509 --> 00:56:29,224
- You thought I didn't have it in me.
- Now, you led a bloated police force on a merry chase

658
00:56:29,351 --> 00:56:32,109
with a load of fancy new toys from Fox.

659
00:56:32,144 --> 00:56:34,787
What about when
you come up against him? What then?

660
00:56:34,787 --> 00:56:40,134
- I'll fight harder. I always have.
- Take a look. His speed... his ferocity, his training....

661
00:56:40,166 --> 00:56:45,974
I see the power of belief.
I see... the League of Shadows resurgent.

662
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:49,437
- You said he was excommunicated.
- By Ra's Al Ghul.

663
00:56:50,581 --> 00:56:51,942
Who leads them now?

664
00:56:52,016 --> 00:56:54,326
Ra's Al Ghul was
the League of Shadows and I beat 'im.

665
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:57,571
Bane is just a mercenary.
We need to find out what he's up to.

666
00:56:58,571 --> 00:57:01,291
Trades... of some kind. Coded.

667
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,966
And my fingerprint,
courtesy of Selina Kyle.

668
00:57:05,041 --> 00:57:06,113
Get this to Fox.

669
00:57:06,113 --> 00:57:10,131
He can crack the code and tell us...
what trades they were executing.

670
00:57:14,189 --> 00:57:17,862
I'll get this to Mr. Fox,
but no more.

671
00:57:19,588 --> 00:57:23,299
I've sewn you up, I've set your bones,
but I won't bury you.

672
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:26,694
I've buried enough members...
of the Wayne family.

673
00:57:27,461 --> 00:57:32,184
- You'll leave me?
- You see only one end to your journey.

674
00:57:33,217 --> 00:57:37,329
Leaving is all I have...
to make you understand.

675
00:57:42,023 --> 00:57:45,713
You used to talk about finishing,
about a life beyond that awful cave.

676
00:57:45,874 --> 00:57:49,624
Alfred, Rachel died... knowing
that we had decided to be together.

677
00:57:49,624 --> 00:57:53,467
That was my life beyond the cave.
I can't just... move on.

678
00:57:54,128 --> 00:57:57,188
She... She didn't. She couldn't.

679
00:57:57,794 --> 00:57:59,044
What if she had?

680
00:57:59,306 --> 00:58:00,858
She... I mean,
I can't change that.

681
00:58:01,055 --> 00:58:04,023
What if before she died
she wrote a letter,

682
00:58:04,058 --> 00:58:07,543
saying she chose
Harvey Dent over you?

683
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:12,979
And what if...

684
00:58:14,434 --> 00:58:15,920
to spare you pain...

685
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,934
I burnt that letter?

686
00:58:20,989 --> 00:58:25,269
How dare you use Rachel...
to try to stop me?

687
00:58:25,291 --> 00:58:28,462
I am using the truth,
Master Wayne.

688
00:58:29,323 --> 00:58:32,035
Maybe it's time we all stopped
trying to outsmart the truth

689
00:58:32,233 --> 00:58:33,977
and let it have its day.

690
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:38,049
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

691
00:58:38,253 --> 00:58:40,635
You expect to destroy my world...

692
00:58:43,136 --> 00:58:45,691
and then think that
we're gonna shake hands?

693
00:58:45,793 --> 00:58:46,912
No, no.

694
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:52,034
- I know what this means.
- What does it mean?

695
00:58:52,069 --> 00:58:54,596
It means your hatred.

696
00:58:54,779 --> 00:58:58,325
And it also means losing someone
that I have cared for

697
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:02,186
since I first heard his cries... echo

698
00:59:03,732 --> 00:59:05,233
through this house.

699
00:59:06,121 --> 00:59:10,578
But it might also mean
saving your life.

700
00:59:11,699 --> 00:59:14,651
And that... is more important.

701
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,902
Goodbye, Alfred.

702
00:59:40,216 --> 00:59:41,329
Alfred?

703
00:59:46,546 --> 00:59:49,031
- Answering your own door?
- Yeah.

704
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,833
Page three.

705
00:59:52,427 --> 00:59:56,470
Seems you made a series of large
put options on the futures exchange...

706
00:59:56,684 --> 00:59:58,249
verified by thumbprint.

707
00:59:58,284 --> 01:00:00,782
Those options expired
at midnight last night.

708
01:00:01,004 --> 01:00:05,808
Long-term, we may be able to prove fraud.
But for now, you're completely broke

709
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:09,485
and Wayne Enterprises is about
to fall into the hands of John Daggett.

710
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:13,411
The weapons. We can't let Daggett
get his hands on Applied Sciences.

711
01:00:13,411 --> 01:00:16,662
No. Applied Sciences is all locked up
and off the books.

712
01:00:16,906 --> 01:00:19,635
The energy project, however,
is a different story.

713
01:00:20,129 --> 01:00:21,488
Miranda Tate.

714
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:24,767
We need to convince the board
to get behind her.

715
01:00:24,767 --> 01:00:25,813
Let's show 'er the reactor.

716
01:00:25,933 --> 01:00:29,335
We're meeting her there in... 35 minutes,
so you better get dressed.

717
01:00:29,817 --> 01:00:33,331
You brought me out here
to show me this, Mr. Fox?

718
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:35,518
Bear with me, Miss Tate.

719
01:00:39,361 --> 01:00:42,578
Please, keep hands and feet
inside the car at all times.

720
01:00:48,515 --> 01:00:50,019
This is it, isn't it?

721
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:53,228
The reactor is beneath the river...

722
01:00:54,022 --> 01:00:57,569
so it can be instantly flooded
in the event of a security breach.

723
01:00:58,457 --> 01:01:01,198
Is Bruce Wayne really that paranoid?

724
01:01:01,597 --> 01:01:03,720
I'm gonna plead the Fifth
on that one.

725
01:01:10,781 --> 01:01:13,855
I thought you might like to see
what your investment built.

726
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:18,367
No fossil fuels.
Free clean energy for an entire city.

727
01:01:18,452 --> 01:01:22,227
Three years ago,
a Russian scientist published a paper

728
01:01:22,227 --> 01:01:24,221
on weaponized fusion reactions.

729
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:29,309
One week later, your reactor
started developing problems.

730
01:01:30,755 --> 01:01:32,480
I think this machine works.

731
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:39,282
Miranda... If it were operational...
the danger to Gotham would be too great.

732
01:01:39,451 --> 01:01:42,239
Would it make you feel better
to know that the Russian scientist

733
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:45,650
died in a plane crash
six months ago?

734
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:49,226
Someone will work out
what Dr. Pavel did.

735
01:01:49,226 --> 01:01:55,205
Someone will figure out a way to...
make this power source... into a nuclear weapon.

736
01:01:56,705 --> 01:02:01,085
I need you to take control
of Wayne Enterprises...

737
01:02:01,614 --> 01:02:02,949
and this reactor.

738
01:02:03,232 --> 01:02:05,346
- To do what with it?
- Nothing.

739
01:02:06,571 --> 01:02:08,765
Until we can guarantee its safety.

740
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,950
- And if we can't?
- Decommission it. Flood it.

741
01:02:12,317 --> 01:02:16,050
Destroy the world's best chance
for a sustainable future?

742
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:17,524
If the world's not ready, yes.

743
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:22,159
Bruce, if you want to save the world,
you have to start trusting it.

744
01:02:22,578 --> 01:02:23,905
I'm trusting you.

745
01:02:24,087 --> 01:02:26,074
Doesn't count.
You have no choice.

746
01:02:26,793 --> 01:02:29,127
I could have flooded this chamber
at any time in the last three years.

747
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:31,448
I'm choosing to trust you.

748
01:02:32,273 --> 01:02:33,265
Please.

749
01:02:40,702 --> 01:02:44,414
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
This meeting will now come to order.

750
01:02:45,031 --> 01:02:47,929
I'd like to point out that we have
a non-board member here,

751
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:51,750
which is highly irregular,
even if his family name is above the door.

752
01:02:51,785 --> 01:02:54,121
Bruce Wayne's family
built this company.

753
01:02:54,332 --> 01:02:55,949
And he himself has run it.

754
01:02:55,949 --> 01:03:01,013
Into the ground, sir! Does anybody disagree?
And check the share price this morning.

755
01:03:01,048 --> 01:03:05,246
Crazy gamblin' on futures
has not only cost Mr. Wayne his seat,

756
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:09,200
it's cost us all a lot of money.
And he has to go.

757
01:03:10,679 --> 01:03:12,812
I'm afraid he has a point, Mr. Wayne.

758
01:03:21,045 --> 01:03:22,288
Now, back to business.

759
01:03:23,395 --> 01:03:26,248
- Hey, Mr. Wayne, over here!
- How's it feel to be one o' the people, Mr. Wayne?

760
01:03:26,795 --> 01:03:27,928
Mr. Wayne,
they're towing your car!

761
01:03:27,928 --> 01:03:30,111
I didn't know what to do,
they had paperwork, I didnt notice it.

762
01:03:32,551 --> 01:03:34,315
Looks like you need a ride, huh?

763
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:36,122
Wayne, we'll give you a ride!

764
01:03:36,869 --> 01:03:41,132
How the hell did Miranda Tate get
the inside track on the Wayne board?

765
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:43,735
I mean, she been meeting with 'im?
She been sleeping with 'im?

766
01:03:43,735 --> 01:03:46,596
- Not that we know of.
- Ah, clearly, you don't know much of anything, do you?

767
01:03:46,596 --> 01:03:48,514
- Where is Bane?
- Oh, we told him it was urgent.

768
01:03:48,637 --> 01:03:50,984
- Oh, where is that masked...?
- Speak of the devil...

769
01:03:51,575 --> 01:03:53,159
and he shall appear.

770
01:03:53,286 --> 01:03:56,579
What... the hell is going on?

771
01:03:57,149 --> 01:04:00,503
- The plan is proceeding as expected.
- Oh, really?

772
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:03,649
Do I look like I'm running
Wayne Enterprises right now?

773
01:04:03,791 --> 01:04:08,176
Your hit on the stock exchange,
it didn't work, my friend.

774
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:13,840
And now you have my construction crews
going around the city at 24 hours a day.

775
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:18,934
How exactly is that supposed to help
my company absorb Wayne's?

776
01:04:21,316 --> 01:04:23,818
- Leave us.
- No. You stay here.

777
01:04:23,941 --> 01:04:24,988
I'm in charge.

778
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:28,427
Do you feel in charge?

779
01:04:33,718 --> 01:04:38,340
- I've paid you a small fortune.
- And this gives you power over me?

780
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:40,310
What is this?

781
01:04:40,689 --> 01:04:45,627
Your money and infrastructure
have been important...

782
01:04:46,055 --> 01:04:47,253
till now.

783
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:50,788
- What are you?
- I'm Gotham's reckoning.

784
01:04:50,911 --> 01:04:54,033
Here to end the borrowed time
you've all been living on.

785
01:04:56,001 --> 01:04:58,563
You're... pure evil.

786
01:04:59,104 --> 01:05:01,026
I'm necessary evil.

787
01:05:01,178 --> 01:05:03,678
No. No, no, no!

788
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,314
When you started, why the mask?

789
01:05:10,791 --> 01:05:13,283
- To protect the people closest to me.
- Yet you were a loner, right?

790
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:16,567
- You didn't have any family?
- There are always people you care about.

791
01:05:16,902 --> 01:05:21,062
You just... don't realize how much
until they're gone.

792
01:05:21,252 --> 01:05:24,157
The idea was to be a symbol.

793
01:05:24,333 --> 01:05:29,235
Batman... could be anybody.
That was the point.

794
01:05:29,929 --> 01:05:33,182
- Well, it's damn good to see 'im back.
- Not everybody agrees.

795
01:05:33,271 --> 01:05:37,037
- They'll figure that out in the end.
- You got anything on Bane's whereabouts?

796
01:05:37,969 --> 01:05:41,418
Yeah. I got 500 pages of tunnel records
and a flashlight.

797
01:05:41,490 --> 01:05:43,157
I could use some help, actually.

798
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:46,437
You know what?
Drop me in Old Town.

799
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:51,975
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
I don't think so!

800
01:05:51,975 --> 01:05:53,701
- That's the way this works!
- I don't think so! Hey!

801
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,427
- That is the way...
- He's not a mark.

802
01:05:56,036 --> 01:05:58,458
And he doesn't have a cent
to his name, anyway.

803
01:05:59,613 --> 01:06:03,575
Yeah, it's not much. But...
it's more than you've got right now.

804
01:06:03,923 --> 01:06:06,419
Actually,
they're... letting me keep the house.

805
01:06:06,587 --> 01:06:09,172
The rich don't even go broke
the same as the rest of us, huh?

806
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:13,426
My powerful... friend might hope
to change your mind about leaving.

807
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:16,394
- And how would he do that?
- By giving you what you want.

808
01:06:16,598 --> 01:06:19,282
- It doesn't exist.
- He says it does.

809
01:06:19,784 --> 01:06:22,429
- He wants to meet tonight.
- Why?

810
01:06:22,519 --> 01:06:25,945
He needs to find Bane.
Says you'd know how.

811
01:06:29,153 --> 01:06:31,475
- Tell him I'll think about it.
- Okay.

812
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:32,947
I like your place.

813
01:06:34,829 --> 01:06:35,914
Mr. Wayne?

814
01:06:38,629 --> 01:06:40,649
I'm sorry they took all your money.

815
01:06:41,871 --> 01:06:43,034
No, you're not.

816
01:06:44,405 --> 01:06:46,859
- Can we help you, officer?
- Uh, yeah.

817
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:50,607
John Daggett's body was just found
in a dumpster about an hour ago.

818
01:06:50,983 --> 01:06:53,182
- Thought you might wanna know.
- Why?

819
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:54,654
Well,
his name's all over these permits

820
01:06:54,654 --> 01:06:57,167
I just pulled to, uh,
map the tunnels under Gotham.

821
01:06:57,167 --> 01:07:01,358
That's MTA maintenance, uh,
sewer construction, couple of other things.

822
01:07:01,358 --> 01:07:03,930
Where did you get to
with the tunnel searches?

823
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:07,694
Remind me to tell detail
to keep hotheads out.

824
01:07:07,756 --> 01:07:09,733
We've had teams down there.
It's a huge network.

825
01:07:09,882 --> 01:07:13,381
Well, get more men. Work a grid.
I want 'im found.

826
01:07:13,508 --> 01:07:15,888
Yeah, the, uh, masked man.
We're on it.

827
01:07:15,906 --> 01:07:18,854
Lose the uniform.
You're working for me now.

828
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,501
And we could use some hotter heads
around here.

829
01:07:21,707 --> 01:07:25,195
- Sir, that could also be a coincidence.
- You're a detective now, son.

830
01:07:25,887 --> 01:07:28,941
You're not allowed to believe
in coincidence anymore.

831
01:07:40,235 --> 01:07:41,685
Nobody's answering.

832
01:07:42,046 --> 01:07:42,958
No.

833
01:07:43,379 --> 01:07:45,341
I'm... on my own now.

834
01:07:45,837 --> 01:07:47,281
Do you have keys?

835
01:07:48,501 --> 01:07:49,721
Never needed them.

836
01:07:56,402 --> 01:07:58,174
Hope you didn't like me
for my money.

837
01:07:58,874 --> 01:08:01,020
Suffering builds character.

838
01:08:07,635 --> 01:08:10,289
I'll take care of
your parents' legacy, Bruce.

839
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:13,492
Who's this?

840
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:22,597
Where's Alfred?

841
01:08:24,391 --> 01:08:25,776
He left...

842
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,172
taking everything.

843
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:54,754
What's that?

844
01:08:55,876 --> 01:08:57,906
My power's been shut off.

845
01:09:03,585 --> 01:09:04,804
You're good at that.

846
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:08,859
When I was a child,
we had almost nothing.

847
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:14,018
But on the nights when we had a fire,
we felt very rich indeed.

848
01:09:15,813 --> 01:09:18,851
I assumed your family was... wealthy.

849
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:21,174
Not always.

850
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:23,476
Not when I was young.

851
01:09:24,264 --> 01:09:25,930
An old mistake.

852
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:28,871
I've made a few myself.

853
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:31,887
More than a few.

854
01:09:34,086 --> 01:09:37,491
We could leave.
Tonight.

855
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:42,405
Take my plane...
go anywhere we wanted.

856
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:45,718
Someday, perhaps.

857
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:48,136
Not tonight.

858
01:10:16,253 --> 01:10:18,464
Don't be shy.

859
01:10:20,257 --> 01:10:22,683
Wayne says you can get me
the clean slate.

860
01:10:23,147 --> 01:10:25,924
- That depends.
- On what?

861
01:10:26,134 --> 01:10:27,684
On what you want it for.

862
01:10:27,913 --> 01:10:30,609
I acquired it to keep it
out of the wrong hands.

863
01:10:31,248 --> 01:10:33,232
Still don't trust me, huh?

864
01:10:34,478 --> 01:10:38,563
- How can we change that?
- Start by taking me to Bane.

865
01:10:41,675 --> 01:10:42,781
You asked.

866
01:10:45,386 --> 01:10:47,283
From here,
Bane's men patrol the tunnels.

867
01:10:47,801 --> 01:10:49,958
And they're not
your average brawlers.

868
01:10:50,730 --> 01:10:52,173
Neither am I.

869
01:11:00,185 --> 01:11:01,423
- He's behind you.
- Who?

870
01:11:01,476 --> 01:11:02,415
Me.

871
01:11:07,559 --> 01:11:08,551
What do you think you're...?

872
01:11:21,537 --> 01:11:23,173
Just a little further.

873
01:11:31,021 --> 01:11:33,514
I had to find a way to stop them
trying to kill me.

874
01:11:33,745 --> 01:11:41,135
- You made a serious mistake.
- Not as serious as yours... I fear.

875
01:11:45,175 --> 01:11:46,217
Bane.

876
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:49,444
Let's not stand on ceremony here...

877
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,805
Mr. Wayne.

878
01:12:04,505 --> 01:12:08,558
Peace has cost you your strength.
Victory has defeated you.

879
01:13:10,614 --> 01:13:16,149
Theatricality and deception,
powerful agents to the uninitiated.

880
01:13:16,188 --> 01:13:19,327
But we are initiated,
aren't we, Bruce?

881
01:13:20,065 --> 01:13:22,576
Members of the League of Shadows.

882
01:13:24,808 --> 01:13:27,317
And you betrayed us.

883
01:13:28,047 --> 01:13:30,971
"Us"? You were excommunicated...

884
01:13:31,259 --> 01:13:33,614
by a gang of psychopaths.

885
01:13:37,710 --> 01:13:40,790
I am the League of Shadows.

886
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:44,407
And I'm here to fulfill
Ra's Al Ghul's destiny.

887
01:13:57,771 --> 01:14:01,559
You fight like a younger man.
Nothing held back.

888
01:14:02,577 --> 01:14:05,800
Admirable... but mistaken.

889
01:14:09,427 --> 01:14:16,402
Oh, you think darkness is your ally...
But you merely adopted the dark.

890
01:14:17,288 --> 01:14:19,169
I was born in it.

891
01:14:19,746 --> 01:14:21,941
Molded by it.

892
01:14:23,041 --> 01:14:26,127
I didn't see the light
until I was already a man.

893
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:29,379
By then, it was nothing to me
but blinding!

894
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:36,769
The shadows betray you
because they belong to me!

895
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:45,104
I will show you where
I have made my home,

896
01:14:45,272 --> 01:14:48,299
whilst preparing to bring justice.

897
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:53,435
Then, I will break you.

898
01:15:01,961 --> 01:15:03,895
Your precious armory.

899
01:15:04,189 --> 01:15:07,661
Gratefully accepted.
We will need it.

900
01:15:16,853 --> 01:15:20,521
Ah, yes! I was wondering
what would break first.

901
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:26,617
Your spirit...

902
01:15:31,539 --> 01:15:32,860
or your body.

903
01:16:17,098 --> 01:16:20,220
Get me commissioner Gordon. I got a line
on the Congressman's kidnapping.

904
01:16:33,214 --> 01:16:34,255
- Excuse me, miss.
- Uh, yes?

905
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:37,686
I'm gonna need to see your ticket
and identification, please.

906
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:39,802
Oh. Do you mind?

907
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:55,735
I showed your picture
to the Congressman. Guess what.

908
01:16:56,245 --> 01:16:58,571
Don't tell me. Still in love?

909
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:01,665
Oh, head over heels.
Pressing charges, though.

910
01:17:02,555 --> 01:17:05,416
You've made some mistakes... Miss Kyle.

911
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:09,459
- Girl's gotta eat.
- And you have an appetite.

912
01:17:09,852 --> 01:17:11,917
Why would you run?
You can't hide from us with a record like this.

913
01:17:12,085 --> 01:17:14,128
Maybe it's not you
I'm running from.

914
01:17:14,462 --> 01:17:17,783
Who then? Bane?
What do you know about him?

915
01:17:19,287 --> 01:17:22,303
That you should be
as afraid of him as I am.

916
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,112
We can offer you protection.

917
01:17:27,968 --> 01:17:28,917
Okay.

918
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:37,163
When I spotted you, I was looking
for a friend of mine. Bruce Wayne.

919
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:41,238
Did they kill 'im?

920
01:17:43,183 --> 01:17:44,897
I'm not sure.

921
01:18:04,710 --> 01:18:06,055
Why didn't you just...

922
01:18:08,316 --> 01:18:09,225
kill me?

923
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:13,285
You don't fear death,
you welcome it.

924
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:16,379
Your punishment must be more severe.

925
01:18:17,377 --> 01:18:20,118
- Torture?
- Yes.

926
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:22,738
But not of your body.

927
01:18:26,650 --> 01:18:28,165
Of your soul.

928
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:32,207
- Where am I?
- Home.

929
01:18:33,245 --> 01:18:35,877
Where I learned
the truth about despair.

930
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,440
As will you.

931
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,715
There is a reason why
this prison is the worst hell on earth.

932
01:18:43,502 --> 01:18:44,641
Hope.

933
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:47,768
Every man who has rotted here
over the centuries

934
01:18:47,768 --> 01:18:51,900
has... looked up to the light
and imagined climbing to freedom.

935
01:18:52,831 --> 01:18:56,574
So easy. So simple.

936
01:18:57,274 --> 01:19:03,226
And like shipwrecked men turning
to seawater from uncontrollable thirst...

937
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:07,622
many have died trying.

938
01:19:07,947 --> 01:19:11,675
I learned here that there can be
no true despair without hope.

939
01:19:13,018 --> 01:19:16,189
So... as I terrorize Gotham,

940
01:19:16,189 --> 01:19:19,962
I will feed its people hope
to poison their souls.

941
01:19:20,587 --> 01:19:22,923
I will let them believe
that they can survive,

942
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:29,294
so that you can watch them
clambering over each other to stay in the sun.

943
01:19:32,126 --> 01:19:35,430
You can watch me
torture an entire city.

944
01:19:35,891 --> 01:19:39,315
And then, when you have truly understood
the depth of your failure...

945
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:42,568
we will fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's destiny.

946
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:48,589
We will destroy Gotham.

947
01:19:49,631 --> 01:19:52,301
And then, when it is done...

948
01:19:52,612 --> 01:19:54,222
and Gotham is...

949
01:19:56,063 --> 01:19:57,422
ashes...

950
01:20:03,067 --> 01:20:05,442
then you have my permission to die.

951
01:20:20,209 --> 01:20:21,559
You're locking her up in here?

952
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:25,444
The Dent Act allows non-segregation
based on extraordinary need.

953
01:20:25,809 --> 01:20:28,778
First time she broke out
of women's correctional, she was 16.

954
01:20:28,973 --> 01:20:32,576
- Little closer, baby.
- Why, honey? You wanna hold my hand?

955
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:35,439
She's gonna be fine.

956
01:20:36,584 --> 01:20:39,689
I still don't see the need of
a board meeting for the energy project.

957
01:20:39,715 --> 01:20:41,144
Bruce got a lot of things right.

958
01:20:41,144 --> 01:20:43,924
Keeping the board in the dark
was not one of them.

959
01:20:46,608 --> 01:20:48,403
How good of you to join us.

960
01:20:48,785 --> 01:20:51,420
Chair. President.

961
01:20:51,698 --> 01:20:55,378
All I need now is
one more ordinary board member.

962
01:20:55,516 --> 01:20:58,954
Mr. Fox,
would you like to nominate?

963
01:20:59,148 --> 01:20:59,976
No.

964
01:21:00,623 --> 01:21:01,995
I will volunteer.

965
01:21:02,447 --> 01:21:03,858
Where you taking us?

966
01:21:14,725 --> 01:21:17,546
You were right, commissioner.
Will you excuse us, please?

967
01:21:17,822 --> 01:21:18,763
What happened?

968
01:21:19,013 --> 01:21:20,958
Your masked man kidnapped
the Wayne Enterprises board.

969
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:24,423
He let most of 'em go,
but he took three of them into the sewers.

970
01:21:24,458 --> 01:21:26,547
No more patrols.
No more hide and seek.

971
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:29,425
Get every available cop down there
and smoke 'im out!

972
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:33,171
- The mayor won't want panic.
- So, it's a training exercise?

973
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:38,150
I'm sorry
I didn't take you seriously.

974
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:40,339
Not you.

975
01:21:40,524 --> 01:21:42,416
You're telling me the Batman's gone...

976
01:21:43,035 --> 01:21:47,611
so you chase up the Daggett leads...
any way you can.

977
01:21:48,122 --> 01:21:49,218
Yes, sir.

978
01:21:59,827 --> 01:22:04,471
He asks how much
you would pay us to let you die.

979
01:22:05,175 --> 01:22:07,502
I told 'im.
I told 'im you have nothing.

980
01:22:07,952 --> 01:22:09,409
Do it for the pleasure.

981
01:22:09,409 --> 01:22:12,718
They pay me more than that
to keep you alive.

982
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:22,364
He will try the climb.

983
01:22:36,691 --> 01:22:39,305
Has anyone... ever made it?

984
01:22:40,181 --> 01:22:41,724
Of course not.

985
01:22:52,158 --> 01:22:54,473
He says there is one who did.

986
01:22:55,476 --> 01:22:56,704
A child.

987
01:22:58,251 --> 01:23:02,284
- A child born in this hell.
- Bane.

988
01:23:03,050 --> 01:23:06,014
An old legend. Nothing more.

989
01:23:09,964 --> 01:23:11,005
Don't.

990
01:23:11,269 --> 01:23:15,717
Whatever it is they want you to see,
it's happening soon.

991
01:23:41,252 --> 01:23:42,847
Fire in the hole!

992
01:24:11,751 --> 01:24:12,917
Turn it on.

993
01:24:17,035 --> 01:24:21,692
I only need one other board member.
There are eight others waiting.

994
01:24:21,994 --> 01:24:23,114
I won't do it.

995
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,093
All right, stop.

996
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:29,014
Lucius, you'll kill this man,
and yourself...

997
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:31,547
and you'll barely slow them down.

998
01:24:57,801 --> 01:25:00,534
Go on, then. Do your work.

999
01:25:03,281 --> 01:25:05,501
Take them up to the surface.

1000
01:25:05,608 --> 01:25:06,802
People of their status

1001
01:25:06,802 --> 01:25:12,582
deserve to experience
the next era of western civilization.

1002
01:25:16,941 --> 01:25:19,365
I've been to half of Daggett's
cement plants and log locations

1003
01:25:19,365 --> 01:25:21,194
they poured for underground construction.

1004
01:25:21,194 --> 01:25:23,185
<i>Anything strange about the pourings?</i>

1005
01:25:23,844 --> 01:25:27,246
Honestly, commissioner...
I don't know anything about civil engineering.

1006
01:25:27,582 --> 01:25:30,112
But you know about patterns.
Keep lookin'.

1007
01:25:36,105 --> 01:25:37,140
It's done.

1008
01:25:41,122 --> 01:25:41,122
This is now...
a 4-megaton nuclear bomb.

1009
01:25:42,891 --> 01:25:45,615
Pull the core out of the reactor.

1010
01:25:47,117 --> 01:25:48,809
No, you cannot.

1011
01:25:49,234 --> 01:25:52,714
This is the only power source
capable of sustaining it.

1012
01:25:53,442 --> 01:25:57,468
If you move it,
the core will decay in a matter of months.

1013
01:25:57,558 --> 01:26:01,261
- Five, by my calculations.
- And then it will go off!

1014
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:06,994
And for the sake of your children,
Dr. Pavel...

1015
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:09,591
indeed I hope it does.

1016
01:26:10,252 --> 01:26:12,364
Hey. Hey!

1017
01:26:14,866 --> 01:26:17,344
That was you in front
of the stock exchange, wasn't it?

1018
01:26:18,627 --> 01:26:20,403
- When?
- When?

1019
01:26:20,438 --> 01:26:22,703
When half the city's cops were tryin'
to pull onto Castle Street

1020
01:26:22,703 --> 01:26:24,322
and your truck was shuttin' them out.

1021
01:26:24,890 --> 01:26:28,394
- Oh, yeah. You're the cop.
- Detective now.

1022
01:26:28,637 --> 01:26:32,371
And, uh, as a detective,
we're not allowed to believe in coincidence.

1023
01:26:42,443 --> 01:26:44,690
What were you doin' here?
What are you workin' on?

1024
01:26:52,905 --> 01:26:54,527
Commissioner, it's Blake.

1025
01:26:54,562 --> 01:26:58,631
I got two dead witnesses
and a lot of questions. Call me whenev...

1026
01:26:59,619 --> 01:27:02,616
Wait a minute. I'm looking at
four barrels of poly-isobutylene.

1027
01:27:04,689 --> 01:27:06,810
That looks like motor oil
right next to it.

1028
01:27:07,099 --> 01:27:10,880
Jesus! They're not makin' cement.
They're makin' explosives.

1029
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:20,857
- Patch me in to Foley.
- Foley's overseeing the operation.

1030
01:27:21,066 --> 01:27:22,491
They're heading into a trap!

1031
01:27:23,764 --> 01:27:26,031
We're seeing literally thousands of police
heading into the sewers.

1032
01:27:26,284 --> 01:27:29,874
- Mr. Mayor? Lit-literally thousands of police.
- It's a training exercise, that's all.

1033
01:27:30,026 --> 01:27:33,673
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got tickets
to watch our boys thrash Rapid City.

1034
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:37,793
- Foley.
- It's a trap! Pull everyone out!

1035
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:40,984
Bane has been pouring concrete
laced with explosives!

1036
01:27:41,107 --> 01:27:41,926
Where?

1037
01:27:58,489 --> 01:27:59,782
<i>There's a ring around the tunnels!</i>

1038
01:27:59,782 --> 01:28:02,255
<i>They're gonna blow it and
trap the cops underground!</i>

1039
01:28:03,210 --> 01:28:06,112
Pull 'em out. Pull 'em out! Now!

1040
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:32,347
That's a lovely, lovely voice.

1041
01:29:13,517 --> 01:29:15,226
Let the games begin.

1042
01:30:31,744 --> 01:30:32,665
Everybody okay?

1043
01:30:34,137 --> 01:30:36,396
- Let's move! Move, move!
- Go, go!

1044
01:30:50,189 --> 01:30:51,507
Gotham...

1045
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:55,414
take control.

1046
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:59,349
Take control of your city.

1047
01:31:04,834 --> 01:31:06,710
- Foley.
- Jesus, Blake.

1048
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:09,281
Every cop in the city's
down in those tunnels.

1049
01:31:10,051 --> 01:31:11,322
Not every cop.

1050
01:31:25,664 --> 01:31:28,683
Sir, are you okay? I'm a police officer.
I need your car right now.

1051
01:32:19,657 --> 01:32:21,174
Clear the corners, rookie.

1052
01:32:22,770 --> 01:32:24,265
Get my coat, son.

1053
01:32:24,374 --> 01:32:25,355
This....

1054
01:32:26,506 --> 01:32:30,092
This is the instrument
of your liberation.

1055
01:32:32,844 --> 01:32:34,941
Satellite shows a radiation spike.

1056
01:32:36,278 --> 01:32:38,687
Whatever it is... it's nuclear.

1057
01:32:43,216 --> 01:32:45,916
Identify yourself to the world.

1058
01:32:47,478 --> 01:32:51,999
Dr. Leonid Pavel... nuclear physicist.

1059
01:32:52,506 --> 01:32:54,819
Pavel was confirmed dead.

1060
01:32:54,854 --> 01:32:58,522
Plane crash on an agency
pull out of Uzbekistan, but....

1061
01:32:59,645 --> 01:33:00,832
It looks like it's him.

1062
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:03,810
And what...? What is this?

1063
01:33:04,301 --> 01:33:07,754
It's a... fully primed neutron bomb...

1064
01:33:08,339 --> 01:33:10,908
with a blast radius of... six miles.

1065
01:33:11,598 --> 01:33:15,204
And who is capable of disarming
such a device?

1066
01:33:16,999 --> 01:33:18,174
Only me.

1067
01:33:19,142 --> 01:33:20,348
Only you.

1068
01:33:21,787 --> 01:33:23,689
Thank you, good doctor.

1069
01:33:26,670 --> 01:33:32,171
Now... this bomb is armed!
And this bomb is mobile!

1070
01:33:32,264 --> 01:33:37,361
And the identity of the triggerman
is a mystery.

1071
01:33:37,929 --> 01:33:42,497
For one of you... holds the detonator!

1072
01:33:42,932 --> 01:33:45,622
Now,
we come here not as conquerors...

1073
01:33:46,431 --> 01:33:51,860
but as liberators, to return control
of this city to the people.

1074
01:33:53,434 --> 01:33:57,803
And at the first sign of interference
from the outside world...

1075
01:33:58,734 --> 01:34:02,424
or from those people
attempting to flee...

1076
01:34:04,449 --> 01:34:06,848
this anonymous Gothamite...

1077
01:34:07,208 --> 01:34:12,400
this unsung hero... will trigger the bomb.

1078
01:34:14,151 --> 01:34:16,743
<i>For now, martial law is in effect.</i>

1079
01:34:17,461 --> 01:34:22,286
Return to your homes...
hold your families close...

1080
01:34:23,638 --> 01:34:24,933
and wait.

1081
01:34:26,210 --> 01:34:29,394
Tomorrow, you claim
what is rightfully yours.

1082
01:34:35,568 --> 01:34:36,855
Pull back the fighters.

1083
01:34:38,023 --> 01:34:40,370
Start
high-level reconnaissance flights.

1084
01:34:41,588 --> 01:34:43,361
Get the President on the line.

1085
01:35:03,883 --> 01:35:08,418
<i>Tanks and planes cannot stop us
from detonating our device.</i>

1086
01:35:08,651 --> 01:35:11,120
<i>Send an emissary
to discuss terms of access</i>

1087
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:13,674
<i>for supplies and communication.</i>

1088
01:35:19,155 --> 01:35:20,982
How many of you are there, son?

1089
01:35:22,943 --> 01:35:26,750
You don't have enough men to stop
12 million people from leaving this island.

1090
01:35:27,263 --> 01:35:31,360
No. No, we don't.
But you do.

1091
01:35:32,811 --> 01:35:36,218
Now, why the hell would I try
to help you keep your hostages?

1092
01:35:36,417 --> 01:35:38,902
If one person crosses this bridge...

1093
01:35:39,237 --> 01:35:41,277
Gotham gets blown to hell.

1094
01:35:47,138 --> 01:35:49,651
<i>The people of our greatest
city are resilient.</i>

1095
01:35:50,922 --> 01:35:54,932
<i>They have proven this before...
and they will prove it again.</i>

1096
01:35:56,592 --> 01:35:59,675
<i>We do not negotiate with terrorists...</i>

1097
01:36:00,353 --> 01:36:02,567
<i>but we do recognize realities.</i>

1098
01:36:03,268 --> 01:36:05,473
<i>As this situation develops...</i>

1099
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:09,041
<i>one thing must be understood
above all others.</i>

1100
01:36:11,098 --> 01:36:14,091
<i>People of Gotham,
we have not abandoned you.</i>

1101
01:36:14,328 --> 01:36:15,665
What does that mean?

1102
01:36:16,521 --> 01:36:18,640
It means we're on our own.

1103
01:36:19,209 --> 01:36:21,134
I have to get in front of a camera.

1104
01:36:21,336 --> 01:36:23,806
Oh, sir, they will kill you
the second you show your face.

1105
01:36:24,181 --> 01:36:28,483
Bane says he's giving Gotham back
to the people. They need to know I could lead.

1106
01:36:28,483 --> 01:36:31,828
- Bane's not gonna let that happen.
- Then he'll show his true colors.

1107
01:36:31,828 --> 01:36:33,186
And you'll be dead.

1108
01:36:52,031 --> 01:36:56,639
Behind you...
stands a symbol of oppression.

1109
01:36:57,872 --> 01:37:03,123
Blackgate Prison,
where a thousand men have languished

1110
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:08,722
under the name of this man:
Harvey Dent.

1111
01:37:09,774 --> 01:37:17,111
Who has been held up to you
as the shining example of justice!

1112
01:37:17,212 --> 01:37:19,648
We're just gonna keep moving you
till we can get you in front of a camera.

1113
01:37:19,648 --> 01:37:24,045
You have been supplied
with a false idol to stop you

1114
01:37:24,213 --> 01:37:27,373
tearing down this corrupt city!

1115
01:37:27,373 --> 01:37:28,075
Yes! Yes!

1116
01:37:28,075 --> 01:37:32,220
Let me tell you the truth
about Harvey Dent.

1117
01:37:32,388 --> 01:37:36,693
From the words of Gotham's
police commissioner...

1118
01:37:37,707 --> 01:37:39,478
James Gordon...

1119
01:37:40,609 --> 01:37:43,690
"The Batman didn't murder Harvey Dent."

1120
01:37:43,858 --> 01:37:45,606
"He saved my boy,"

1121
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:50,285
"then took the blame
for Harvey's appalling crimes"

1122
01:37:50,285 --> 01:37:53,265
"so that I could, to my shame,"

1123
01:37:53,367 --> 01:37:59,859
"build a lie around this fallen idol."

1124
01:38:02,006 --> 01:38:07,088
"I praised the madman
who tried to murder my own child."

1125
01:38:07,462 --> 01:38:10,575
"Well, I can no longer live with my lie."

1126
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:15,089
"It is time to trust the people of Gotham
with the truth..."

1127
01:38:15,372 --> 01:38:19,668
"and it is time for me to resign."

1128
01:38:20,354 --> 01:38:23,846
And do you accept
this man's resignation?

1129
01:38:25,482 --> 01:38:29,868
And do you accept
the resignation of all of these liars?

1130
01:38:29,986 --> 01:38:31,687
Of all the corrupt?

1131
01:38:35,371 --> 01:38:37,595
Those men locked up
for eight years in Blackgate

1132
01:38:37,854 --> 01:38:41,379
and denied parole under the Dent Act,
it was based on a lie.

1133
01:38:43,018 --> 01:38:44,871
Gotham needed a hero.

1134
01:38:45,105 --> 01:38:48,778
Well, it needs it now more than ever.
You betrayed everything you stood for.

1135
01:38:50,980 --> 01:38:56,562
There's a point... far out there
when the structures fail you,

1136
01:38:56,562 --> 01:38:58,714
and when the rules
aren't weapons anymore,

1137
01:38:58,714 --> 01:39:03,706
they're... shackles,
letting the bad guy get ahead.

1138
01:39:05,465 --> 01:39:10,259
One day... you may face
such a moment of crisis.

1139
01:39:10,259 --> 01:39:13,689
And in that moment,
I hope you have a friend like I did...

1140
01:39:14,862 --> 01:39:20,265
to plunge their hands into the filth,
so that you can keep yours clean!

1141
01:39:21,579 --> 01:39:24,331
Your hands look plenty filthy to me,
commissioner.

1142
01:39:26,048 --> 01:39:29,808
We take Gotham from the corrupt!

1143
01:39:31,551 --> 01:39:32,778
The rich!

1144
01:39:33,674 --> 01:39:35,510
The oppressors of generations

1145
01:39:35,678 --> 01:39:40,188
who have kept you down
with myths of opportunity.

1146
01:39:40,266 --> 01:39:42,465
And we give it back to you...

1147
01:39:44,018 --> 01:39:45,542
the people.

1148
01:39:47,113 --> 01:39:49,210
Gotham is yours!

1149
01:39:49,527 --> 01:39:53,013
None shall interfere.
Do as you please.

1150
01:39:54,372 --> 01:39:58,908
But start by storming Blackgate
and freeing the oppressed!

1151
01:39:58,908 --> 01:39:59,803
Open it!

1152
01:40:08,339 --> 01:40:11,020
Step forward,
those who would serve...

1153
01:40:13,065 --> 01:40:15,548
for an army will be raised.

1154
01:40:18,999 --> 01:40:23,613
The powerful will be ripped
from their decadent nests...

1155
01:40:27,856 --> 01:40:33,489
and cast out into the cold world
that we know and endure.

1156
01:40:38,341 --> 01:40:41,270
Courts will be convened.

1157
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:51,027
Spoils will be enjoyed!

1158
01:40:55,317 --> 01:40:57,042
Blood will be shed!

1159
01:41:00,371 --> 01:41:02,698
The police will survive...

1160
01:41:02,931 --> 01:41:07,144
as they learn to serve... true justice!

1161
01:41:08,612 --> 01:41:10,980
This great city...

1162
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:15,298
it will endure.

1163
01:41:17,569 --> 01:41:20,755
Gotham will survive!

1164
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:45,684
He says
you must first fix your back.

1165
01:41:45,719 --> 01:41:48,647
- How does he know?
- Ah, he was the prison doctor.

1166
01:41:48,647 --> 01:41:52,499
He's a morphine addict
who incurred the displeasure

1167
01:41:52,499 --> 01:41:56,772
of powerful people...
including your masked friend.

1168
01:41:57,465 --> 01:41:58,488
How?

1169
01:42:00,305 --> 01:42:04,036
Many years ago...
it was a time of plague.

1170
01:42:06,224 --> 01:42:09,162
Some of the other prisoners
attacked Bane.

1171
01:42:11,381 --> 01:42:14,588
The doctor's fumbling attempts
to repair the damage...

1172
01:42:15,425 --> 01:42:17,470
left him in perpetual agony.

1173
01:42:17,570 --> 01:42:24,131
- The mask holds the pain at bay.
- Bane... was the child you spoke of?

1174
01:42:24,382 --> 01:42:25,751
He was born here?

1175
01:42:26,647 --> 01:42:31,002
The legend is that there was a mercenary
who worked for a local warlord.

1176
01:42:31,488 --> 01:42:34,024
He fell in love with
the warlord's daughter.

1177
01:42:34,818 --> 01:42:38,161
They were married in secret.
When the warlord found out...

1178
01:42:39,087 --> 01:42:42,755
the mercenary was...
condemned to this pit.

1179
01:42:43,319 --> 01:42:45,800
But then he exiled him instead.

1180
01:42:45,901 --> 01:42:49,737
The mercenary understood that
it was the daughter who had secured his release.

1181
01:42:49,936 --> 01:42:54,612
But what he could not know...
was the true price of his freedom.

1182
01:42:55,921 --> 01:42:57,878
She took his place in the pit.

1183
01:43:00,788 --> 01:43:04,171
And she was with child,
I mean, the-the mercenary's child.

1184
01:43:06,912 --> 01:43:10,476
Innocence cannot flower underground.
It has to be stamped out.

1185
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:18,074
One day... the doctor forgot
to lock the cell.

1186
01:43:25,591 --> 01:43:27,689
But the child had a friend...

1187
01:43:28,595 --> 01:43:33,706
a protector... who showed the others
that this innocence was their redemption.

1188
01:43:33,874 --> 01:43:35,550
It was to be prized.

1189
01:43:35,874 --> 01:43:37,837
The mother was not so lucky.

1190
01:43:40,712 --> 01:43:44,405
This is Bane's prison now.
He wouldn't want this story told.

1191
01:43:55,846 --> 01:43:59,372
There's a vertebra...
protruding from your back.

1192
01:43:59,874 --> 01:44:01,925
It has to be put back.

1193
01:44:07,131 --> 01:44:09,700
Stay like this until you stand.

1194
01:44:19,054 --> 01:44:22,832
Did you not think
I would return, Bruce? Hm?

1195
01:44:28,458 --> 01:44:30,360
I told you I was immortal.

1196
01:44:32,792 --> 01:44:34,943
I watched... I watched you die.

1197
01:44:34,943 --> 01:44:37,728
Oh, there are
many forms of immortality.

1198
01:44:39,750 --> 01:44:41,107
Once, I had a wife...

1199
01:44:42,764 --> 01:44:44,246
my great love.

1200
01:44:45,845 --> 01:44:49,509
- She was taken from me.
- You were the mercenary.

1201
01:44:53,161 --> 01:44:55,121
Bane is your child.

1202
01:44:56,852 --> 01:44:58,083
Your heir.

1203
01:44:58,118 --> 01:45:00,710
An heir to ensure
the League of Shadows fulfills its duty

1204
01:45:00,877 --> 01:45:03,346
to restore balance to civilization.

1205
01:45:03,951 --> 01:45:04,908
No.

1206
01:45:04,943 --> 01:45:08,301
You yourself fought the decadence
of Gotham for years...

1207
01:45:08,679 --> 01:45:10,300
with all your strength...

1208
01:45:10,762 --> 01:45:14,974
all your resources,
all your moral authority.

1209
01:45:15,899 --> 01:45:18,728
And the only victory
you could achieve was a lie.

1210
01:45:19,354 --> 01:45:22,583
Now you understand.
Gotham is beyond saving.

1211
01:45:22,637 --> 01:45:23,155
No.

1212
01:45:23,155 --> 01:45:26,341
- And must be allowed to die.
- No!

1213
01:45:32,716 --> 01:45:36,618
Yeah. Just lift your head.
Oh, that's good.

1214
01:45:42,466 --> 01:45:44,022
No. No!

1215
01:46:18,999 --> 01:46:21,057
- What's that?
- This was someone's home.

1216
01:46:21,057 --> 01:46:23,223
And now it's everyone's home.

1217
01:46:25,277 --> 01:46:28,008
There's a storm coming, remember?
This is what you wanted.

1218
01:46:57,346 --> 01:47:00,189
It's for the bus.
In case there's a chance to evacuate.

1219
01:47:00,189 --> 01:47:02,015
Any news?
Is the commissioner...?

1220
01:47:02,094 --> 01:47:05,409
The less you know, father.
How are the boys doin'?

1221
01:47:05,409 --> 01:47:08,386
Well, we've had more power on,
so they've got some TV.

1222
01:47:08,644 --> 01:47:10,011
It's good to see you.

1223
01:47:10,518 --> 01:47:14,311
Blake, you be careful out there.
They're huntin' down cops like dogs.

1224
01:47:20,142 --> 01:47:21,434
Why build yourself?

1225
01:47:23,939 --> 01:47:29,072
- I'm not meant to die in here.
- Here, there. What's the difference?

1226
01:48:30,805 --> 01:48:35,909
- I told you it could not be done.
- You told me a child did it.

1227
01:48:36,968 --> 01:48:42,531
But no ordinary child.
A child... born in hell.

1228
01:48:46,747 --> 01:48:48,690
Forged from suffering.

1229
01:48:50,148 --> 01:48:52,441
Hardened by pain.

1230
01:48:54,191 --> 01:48:56,612
Not a man from privilege.

1231
01:49:15,862 --> 01:49:17,540
We got boots on the ground, sir.

1232
01:49:18,426 --> 01:49:19,984
Just waiting on intel.

1233
01:49:25,416 --> 01:49:28,174
- You have ID?
- Course not.

1234
01:49:28,186 --> 01:49:31,248
- Well, how can we trust you?
- We don't have any choice.

1235
01:49:31,968 --> 01:49:34,251
Commissioner Gordon.
Captain Jones, Special Forces.

1236
01:49:34,266 --> 01:49:35,824
Captain.
Glad to have you here.

1237
01:49:35,986 --> 01:49:38,487
It's our job, sir.
Now, uh, how many of you are there?

1238
01:49:38,655 --> 01:49:41,536
Well, there's dozens.
I-I'd rather not say exactly.

1239
01:49:41,944 --> 01:49:44,994
But the men trapped underground
number almost 3,000.

1240
01:49:45,161 --> 01:49:47,295
- What kinda condition are they in?
- They're getting food an' water.

1241
01:49:47,330 --> 01:49:49,165
- Can we break 'em out?
- Yes, sir.

1242
01:49:49,393 --> 01:49:52,380
Take out the mercenaries
guarding the outflow south of Ackerman Park....

1243
01:49:52,408 --> 01:49:55,251
blow the rubble, we can make a hole
big enough for 10 at a time.

1244
01:49:55,525 --> 01:49:57,629
I-I'm in contact with my partner
who's down there.

1245
01:49:57,629 --> 01:49:58,549
They're just waitin' for the day.

1246
01:49:58,549 --> 01:50:00,343
Men who haven't seen daylight
in 3 months?

1247
01:50:00,343 --> 01:50:02,835
Police officers who haven't seen daylight
in 3 months.

1248
01:50:02,835 --> 01:50:06,309
What about the bomb?
Satellite can't pick up any... radiation hot spots.

1249
01:50:06,309 --> 01:50:09,569
They keep it on a truck.
It must have a lead-lined roof.

1250
01:50:09,644 --> 01:50:12,405
- They-they move it constantly.
-  Good. So you know the truck?

1251
01:50:12,566 --> 01:50:15,657
Well, it's one of three.
We've been tracking it.

1252
01:50:16,504 --> 01:50:17,477
Decoy.

1253
01:50:19,017 --> 01:50:20,432
You don't really think
he's comin' back, do you?

1254
01:50:20,432 --> 01:50:21,846
Doesn't matter what I think.

1255
01:50:22,387 --> 01:50:26,215
Actually, it does. You should put your faith
in something a little more real.

1256
01:50:26,374 --> 01:50:29,545
- The-the routes don't vary much.
- Okay. What about the triggerman?

1257
01:50:29,545 --> 01:50:34,025
No leads. It's-it's a bluff. Bane wouldn't
give control of that bomb to someone else.

1258
01:50:34,174 --> 01:50:38,356
We can't take that chance. Until we have
the triggerman, we just track the device.

1259
01:50:38,474 --> 01:50:42,301
And meanwhile, Gotham lives
under a warlord, like some failed state?

1260
01:50:42,515 --> 01:50:45,431
Dial it back, officer.
This situation is unprecedented.

1261
01:50:45,666 --> 01:50:47,471
We can't do anything to risk millions of lives.

1262
01:50:47,471 --> 01:50:51,079
You gonna tell 'im?
You gonna tell 'im what's really goin' on?

1263
01:50:51,079 --> 01:50:54,363
Captain, the... situation is
more complicated than you think.

1264
01:50:54,363 --> 01:50:56,324
There's... someone you need to meet.

1265
01:50:56,918 --> 01:50:58,718
Came upstairs
lookin' for a vantage point.

1266
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:00,853
Found the people
who run the corporation livin' out there.

1267
01:51:00,853 --> 01:51:04,444
- What corporation?
- Wayne Enterprises. You good?

1268
01:51:13,790 --> 01:51:16,047
Mr. Fox, would you like to brief
the captain?

1269
01:51:16,189 --> 01:51:18,432
Uh, Miss Tate's
fully aware of the situation.

1270
01:51:18,822 --> 01:51:23,342
And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises,
I have to take responsibility for it.

1271
01:51:23,441 --> 01:51:25,291
- Why?
- We built it.

1272
01:51:25,783 --> 01:51:26,933
You built the bomb?

1273
01:51:26,933 --> 01:51:31,161
It was built as a fusion reactor.
First of its kind.

1274
01:51:31,606 --> 01:51:35,201
Bane turned the core into a bomb
and removed it from the reactor.

1275
01:51:35,201 --> 01:51:38,399
- Here's the important part.
- As the device's fuel cells deteriorate,

1276
01:51:38,566 --> 01:51:42,466
it becomes increasingly unstable,
to the point of detonation.

1277
01:51:42,466 --> 01:51:44,163
This bomb is a time bomb.

1278
01:51:44,163 --> 01:51:48,283
And it will go off in 23 days,
regardless of Bane's revolution

1279
01:51:48,451 --> 01:51:51,435
or what we, or the outside world,
choose to do.

1280
01:51:51,470 --> 01:51:54,300
So, your appease men plan
might not be as practical as you thought.

1281
01:51:54,569 --> 01:51:58,919
- Could you disarm it?
- I could reconnect it to the reactor. Stabilize it.

1282
01:51:59,087 --> 01:52:02,001
- Let's move away from this location and call it in.
- Right. Let's go.

1283
01:52:02,001 --> 01:52:05,211
No, no, we'll take it from here.
You stay and look after these folks.

1284
01:52:13,045 --> 01:52:14,192
Someone sold us out.

1285
01:52:15,812 --> 01:52:17,271
Go, go, go!

1286
01:52:38,815 --> 01:52:43,617
- I'll die before I talk.
- I'm on your schedule, captain.

1287
01:52:50,392 --> 01:52:52,357
There were people living upstairs.

1288
01:52:52,971 --> 01:52:54,987
Round them up for judgment...

1289
01:52:59,332 --> 01:53:03,719
and hang them...
where the world could see.

1290
01:53:05,820 --> 01:53:10,540
<i>Police have cordoned off the entire
Central Heights and East Park Side areas...</i>

1291
01:53:10,784 --> 01:53:13,831
<i>as well as Merchant and South Shoreline
Boulevards in an attempt...</i>

1292
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:22,822
He says the leap to freedom
is not about strength.

1293
01:53:23,121 --> 01:53:24,898
My body makes the jump.

1294
01:53:25,465 --> 01:53:29,362
Survival is the spirit. The soul.

1295
01:53:32,462 --> 01:53:35,224
My soul is as ready to escape
as my body.

1296
01:53:35,515 --> 01:53:40,300
- Fear... is why you fail.
- No, I'm not afraid.

1297
01:53:42,111 --> 01:53:43,335
I'm angry.

1298
01:54:12,912 --> 01:54:13,809
Bruce.

1299
01:54:15,306 --> 01:54:16,937
<i>Why do we fall?</i>

1300
01:54:22,697 --> 01:54:24,270
You do not fear death.

1301
01:54:25,358 --> 01:54:29,947
You think this makes you strong.
It makes you weak.

1302
01:54:30,628 --> 01:54:31,606
Why?

1303
01:54:31,846 --> 01:54:34,048
How can you move
faster than possible...

1304
01:54:34,347 --> 01:54:36,463
fight longer than possible...

1305
01:54:37,105 --> 01:54:40,530
without the most powerful impulse
of the spirit?

1306
01:54:41,980 --> 01:54:43,711
The fear of death.

1307
01:54:44,304 --> 01:54:45,970
I do fear death.

1308
01:54:47,797 --> 01:54:49,755
I fear dying in here...

1309
01:54:50,550 --> 01:54:52,487
while my city burns.

1310
01:54:53,635 --> 01:54:55,559
There's no one there to save it.

1311
01:54:56,980 --> 01:54:58,608
Then make the climb.

1312
01:55:03,830 --> 01:55:04,333
How?

1313
01:55:06,190 --> 01:55:07,995
As the child did...

1314
01:55:12,697 --> 01:55:14,449
Without the rope.

1315
01:55:17,137 --> 01:55:19,427
Then fear will find you again.

1316
01:55:26,606 --> 01:55:30,588
Ah, supplies for your journey?
Oh, that's... that's wonderful. That's....

1317
01:55:35,661 --> 01:55:38,639
- What does that mean?
- Rise.

1318
01:55:40,370 --> 01:55:41,218
No.

1319
01:57:11,149 --> 01:57:15,287
No, there's been a mistake!
Take... take me to Bane!

1320
01:57:17,984 --> 01:57:19,431
I wanna see Bane!

1321
01:57:22,944 --> 01:57:24,023
Order!

1322
01:57:24,306 --> 01:57:26,974
This is a mistake!
Where is Bane?

1323
01:57:27,002 --> 01:57:29,347
There's been no mistake,
Mr. Stryver.

1324
01:57:29,586 --> 01:57:32,199
You are... Philip Stryver,

1325
01:57:32,234 --> 01:57:35,650
executive vice-president
of... Daggett Industries...

1326
01:57:35,673 --> 01:57:39,422
who, for years, has been living
off the blood and sweat

1327
01:57:39,635 --> 01:57:45,354
- of people less powerful than him.
- Call Bane. I'm... I am one of you.

1328
01:57:45,389 --> 01:57:49,035
Bane has no authority here.
This is merely a sentencing hearing.

1329
01:57:49,035 --> 01:57:53,784
Now, the choice is yours.
Exile... or death!

1330
01:57:58,145 --> 01:57:59,216
Order!

1331
01:58:00,340 --> 01:58:01,952
Exi... exile.

1332
01:58:02,458 --> 01:58:03,483
Sold.

1333
01:58:04,023 --> 01:58:05,957
To the man in the cold sweat.

1334
01:58:13,208 --> 01:58:14,569
You follow the thick ice.

1335
01:58:14,571 --> 01:58:17,080
You try to swim...
you're dead in minutes.

1336
01:58:17,115 --> 01:58:18,469
Has anyone made it?

1337
01:58:32,089 --> 01:58:34,804
Where the hell are they?
It's not like we have a lot o' time here.

1338
01:58:35,013 --> 01:58:37,947
- How long?
- Bomb goes off tomorrow.

1339
01:58:38,446 --> 01:58:41,053
- We have about 18 hours to do something.
- To do what?

1340
01:58:41,118 --> 01:58:43,529
To mark the truck.
Get a GPS on it

1341
01:58:43,529 --> 01:58:45,929
so we can start to figure out
how to bring it down.

1342
01:58:52,246 --> 01:58:53,188
That's it?

1343
01:58:56,085 --> 01:58:57,064
Foley.

1344
01:58:58,794 --> 01:59:02,509
- Where's Foley, damn it?
- You shouldn't be out on the streets.

1345
01:59:07,371 --> 01:59:10,239
- Jim, he's not here.
- You let your wife come to the door?

1346
01:59:10,350 --> 01:59:13,692
- When the city's under occupation?
- Wait in the kitchen, honey.

1347
01:59:13,727 --> 01:59:16,536
What did you do?
Bury your uniform in the backyard?

1348
01:59:16,571 --> 01:59:18,737
You saw what they did
to those Special Forces.

1349
01:59:18,831 --> 01:59:21,140
Have you forgotten all the years
we were out on patrol?

1350
01:59:21,185 --> 01:59:24,198
When every gangbanger wanted to plant one
as soon as our backs were turned?

1351
01:59:24,198 --> 01:59:27,400
That was different and you know it.
These guys run the city.

1352
01:59:27,400 --> 01:59:28,598
The government's done a deal with 'em.

1353
01:59:28,703 --> 01:59:31,358
Bane's got their balls in a vice.
That's not a deal.

1354
01:59:31,437 --> 01:59:34,728
You move on Bane...
the triggerman is gonna hit the button.

1355
01:59:34,728 --> 01:59:38,106
You think he's given control of that bomb
to one of the people?

1356
01:59:39,175 --> 01:59:41,327
You think
this is part of some revolution?

1357
01:59:41,327 --> 01:59:44,252
There's one man with his finger
on the button. That's Bane.

1358
01:59:44,290 --> 01:59:47,413
Look... We've all gotta keep
our heads down till they can fix this.

1359
01:59:47,471 --> 01:59:52,023
- If you still had a family here...
- This only gets fixed from inside the city!

1360
01:59:53,266 --> 01:59:54,230
Look, Peter.

1361
01:59:55,950 --> 02:00:00,572
I'm not asking you to... walk down Grand in
your dress blues, but something has to be done.

1362
02:00:00,572 --> 02:00:02,679
- Sorry, Jim. I gotta...
- ... Keep your head down?

1363
02:00:02,756 --> 02:00:05,310
What good's that gonna do tomorrow
when that thing blows?

1364
02:00:05,345 --> 02:00:06,903
You don't know
that's gonna happen.

1365
02:00:11,834 --> 02:00:14,255
I hear you're looking for men,
commissioner.

1366
02:00:14,357 --> 02:00:15,767
How about me instead?

1367
02:00:15,895 --> 02:00:18,521
Miss Tate, I, uh,
I can't ask you to do that.

1368
02:00:19,421 --> 02:00:20,464
Please.

1369
02:00:21,535 --> 02:00:24,136
You little punk!
What'd you take?

1370
02:00:24,136 --> 02:00:26,716
I... nothing!
I didn't take anything!

1371
02:00:26,911 --> 02:00:29,614
You steal from us...
you little bastard?

1372
02:00:30,535 --> 02:00:33,089
Now... You boys know
you can't come into my neighborhood

1373
02:00:33,089 --> 02:00:34,644
without asking politely.

1374
02:00:40,514 --> 02:00:43,945
Never steal anything from someone
you can't outrun, kid.

1375
02:00:50,229 --> 02:00:51,927
You're pretty generous...
for a thief.

1376
02:01:01,207 --> 02:01:03,905
- I thought they killed you.
- Not yet.

1377
02:01:04,210 --> 02:01:07,073
- If you're expecting an apology...
- It wouldn't suit you.

1378
02:01:08,865 --> 02:01:09,965
I need your help.

1379
02:01:10,280 --> 02:01:14,132
- And why would I help you?
- For this. Clean slate.

1380
02:01:14,273 --> 02:01:16,059
You'd trust me with that?

1381
02:01:16,756 --> 02:01:18,300
After what I did to you?

1382
02:01:18,561 --> 02:01:20,716
I'll admit,
I was a little let down.

1383
02:01:23,251 --> 02:01:26,325
But I still think there's more to you.
In fact, I think that for you...

1384
02:01:26,636 --> 02:01:27,951
this isn't just a tool.

1385
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:31,241
It's an escape route.
You wanna disappear. Start fresh.

1386
02:01:32,399 --> 02:01:35,371
- I can't even get off this island.
- I can give you a way off...

1387
02:01:35,406 --> 02:01:36,974
once you get me to Lucius Fox.

1388
02:01:37,169 --> 02:01:40,100
I need you to find out where
they're holding him and take me in.

1389
02:01:43,651 --> 02:01:44,920
Why do you need Fox?

1390
02:01:44,955 --> 02:01:47,584
- To save the city.
- Who says it needs saving?

1391
02:01:47,740 --> 02:01:49,236
Maybe I like it this way.

1392
02:01:49,355 --> 02:01:50,743
Maybe you do...

1393
02:01:52,221 --> 02:01:54,687
but tomorrow that bomb's going off.

1394
02:01:57,270 --> 02:01:59,192
Got your powerful friend
on the case?

1395
02:01:59,227 --> 02:02:00,271
I'm trying...

1396
02:02:01,188 --> 02:02:02,729
but I need Fox.

1397
02:02:03,125 --> 02:02:04,316
As it approaches...

1398
02:02:05,545 --> 02:02:06,823
flip the switch.

1399
02:02:06,850 --> 02:02:10,828
The needle hits 200, you give me the signal,
I'll mark the truck. Okay?

1400
02:02:11,860 --> 02:02:13,195
Heads up, heads up.

1401
02:02:29,647 --> 02:02:32,178
- I got it.
- Mercenaries on your 6.

1402
02:02:32,407 --> 02:02:35,044
Stand still! Keep your hands
where we can see them!

1403
02:02:37,451 --> 02:02:39,401
Commissioner Gordon,
you are under arrest.

1404
02:02:39,636 --> 02:02:43,036
- On whose authority?
- The people of Gotham.

1405
02:02:43,751 --> 02:02:48,344
No lawyer? No witnesses?
What sort o' due process is this?

1406
02:02:48,824 --> 02:02:52,245
Your guilt has been determined,
this is merely a sentencing hearing.

1407
02:02:52,460 --> 02:02:53,907
Now, what will it be?

1408
02:02:55,180 --> 02:02:58,259
Death... or... exile?

1409
02:02:58,312 --> 02:03:02,082
Crane, if you think we're going out
onto that ice willingly...

1410
02:03:03,148 --> 02:03:04,785
you have another thing coming.

1411
02:03:07,085 --> 02:03:08,638
Death, then.

1412
02:03:08,638 --> 02:03:10,882
- Looks that way.
- Very well.

1413
02:03:11,078 --> 02:03:12,140
Death...

1414
02:03:13,719 --> 02:03:15,439
by exile.

1415
02:03:18,201 --> 02:03:19,768
Bring her to me.

1416
02:03:26,263 --> 02:03:28,589
Hey! Hey, hey, we're goin' now.
Blake says they're ready!

1417
02:03:28,589 --> 02:03:30,844
Get your gear on! Hey!

1418
02:03:38,077 --> 02:03:39,786
Find this one a spot,
got a big day tomorrow.

1419
02:03:39,954 --> 02:03:42,799
We all do.
It's not every day you bag Bruce Wayne.

1420
02:03:45,395 --> 02:03:47,069
- Bruce.
- You okay?

1421
02:03:47,104 --> 02:03:49,361
Picked a hell of a time
to go on vacation, Mr. Wayne.

1422
02:03:49,450 --> 02:03:51,131
How long until that core ignites?

1423
02:03:51,298 --> 02:03:55,327
- That bomb goes off in 12 hours.
- Unless we can reconnect it to the reactor.

1424
02:03:55,988 --> 02:03:59,418
- Can you get Miranda out of here?
- Not tonight. I'm sorry.

1425
02:03:59,820 --> 02:04:02,401
- Do what's necessary.
- Tonight I need you.

1426
02:04:02,483 --> 02:04:04,485
- What for?
- To get me back in the game.

1427
02:04:05,047 --> 02:04:08,951
Sorry to spoil things, boys,
but... Bane wants these guys to 'imself.

1428
02:04:11,416 --> 02:04:14,604
- I won't forget about you, Miranda.
- I know.

1429
02:04:23,788 --> 02:04:27,397
- I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne.
- He should be so lucky.

1430
02:04:33,343 --> 02:04:35,881
Any move I make on Bane or the bomb...

1431
02:04:36,216 --> 02:04:38,101
triggerman sets it off.

1432
02:04:38,322 --> 02:04:41,357
Well, they won't use radio or cell.
Too much interference.

1433
02:04:41,357 --> 02:04:43,052
Infrared doesn't have the range.

1434
02:04:43,244 --> 02:04:46,065
It'll have to be a microburst.
Longwave.

1435
02:04:46,100 --> 02:04:47,729
- Could you block it?
- Yes.

1436
02:04:47,897 --> 02:04:51,472
But I'll need
the EMP cannon guidance mount from the Bat.

1437
02:04:52,784 --> 02:04:54,115
Remember where you parked?

1438
02:05:08,864 --> 02:05:10,168
She fly okay?

1439
02:05:11,322 --> 02:05:14,430
Yeah. Even without the autopilot,
thanks.

1440
02:05:14,703 --> 02:05:17,349
Autopilot?
That's what you're there for.

1441
02:05:56,984 --> 02:05:59,446
Okay. It's clear. Come on, quick.
One at a time.

1442
02:06:03,639 --> 02:06:04,625
Wait, wait!

1443
02:06:06,453 --> 02:06:07,530
Ross!

1444
02:06:07,984 --> 02:06:08,941
Ross?

1445
02:06:09,897 --> 02:06:12,513
- Lock it up.
- No, keep down.

1446
02:06:12,565 --> 02:06:13,867
Get down!

1447
02:06:15,906 --> 02:06:17,001
Who are you?

1448
02:06:46,686 --> 02:06:47,748
Light it up.

1449
02:07:05,918 --> 02:07:08,821
- Dad, check it out.
- Honey! Come take a look.

1450
02:07:19,113 --> 02:07:20,542
Impossible.

1451
02:07:21,785 --> 02:07:23,530
Keep 'er close.

1452
02:07:24,339 --> 02:07:26,116
He'll come for her.

1453
02:07:26,308 --> 02:07:27,923
Where's Miranda Tate?

1454
02:07:28,658 --> 02:07:29,940
Bane took her.

1455
02:07:30,378 --> 02:07:33,412
He's holed up at city hall,
surrounded by his army.

1456
02:07:33,999 --> 02:07:36,567
This blocks the remote detonator signal
to the bomb.

1457
02:07:36,567 --> 02:07:40,566
Get it onto it before sunrise.
They might hit the button when it starts.

1458
02:07:41,111 --> 02:07:43,541
- When what starts?
- War.

1459
02:08:19,868 --> 02:08:21,123
You missed a spot.

1460
02:08:24,785 --> 02:08:27,530
If you working alone...
wear a mask.

1461
02:08:27,624 --> 02:08:29,728
I'm not afraid to be seen
standing up to these guys.

1462
02:08:34,617 --> 02:08:36,257
Count to five, then throw.

1463
02:08:46,989 --> 02:08:50,006
Hey, no offense, but you got
somethin' bigger in that belt?

1464
02:09:00,176 --> 02:09:03,052
- What now?
- All-out assault on Bane.

1465
02:09:03,579 --> 02:09:05,528
But you need to get people
across the bridge.

1466
02:09:05,718 --> 02:09:07,933
- Why?
- In case we fail.

1467
02:09:08,158 --> 02:09:11,190
Lead an exodus.
Save as many lives as you can.

1468
02:09:11,225 --> 02:09:13,920
- You don't need me here?
- You've given me an army.

1469
02:09:14,271 --> 02:09:15,379
Now go.

1470
02:09:16,230 --> 02:09:18,654
- Hey, thanks.
- Don't thank me yet.

1471
02:09:18,926 --> 02:09:20,889
Well, I might not get a chance later.

1472
02:09:34,992 --> 02:09:36,351
You shouldn't have.

1473
02:09:37,585 --> 02:09:39,562
The midtown tunnel's
blocked by debris...

1474
02:09:40,001 --> 02:09:43,141
but the cannons have enough firepower
to make a path for people.

1475
02:09:43,374 --> 02:09:45,326
Wait until the fighting begins.

1476
02:09:45,361 --> 02:09:48,272
You're gonna wage a war
to save your stuck-up girlfriend?

1477
02:09:48,307 --> 02:09:49,813
To start it, throttle...

1478
02:09:50,855 --> 02:09:54,395
- I got it.
- We have 45 minutes to save this city.

1479
02:09:54,395 --> 02:09:57,451
No, I've got 45 minutes
to get clear of the blast radius

1480
02:09:57,451 --> 02:09:59,461
cause you don't stand a chance
against these guys.

1481
02:09:59,461 --> 02:10:02,916
- With your help, I might.
- I'll open that tunnel, then I'm gone.

1482
02:10:04,397 --> 02:10:05,836
There's more to you than that.

1483
02:10:09,541 --> 02:10:11,330
Sorry to keep letting you down.

1484
02:10:15,269 --> 02:10:16,561
Come with me.

1485
02:10:18,171 --> 02:10:19,457
Save yourself.

1486
02:10:21,964 --> 02:10:26,963
You don't owe these people any more.
You've given them everything.

1487
02:10:27,170 --> 02:10:30,312
Not everything.
Not yet.

1488
02:11:10,556 --> 02:11:11,858
<i>Disperse!</i>

1489
02:11:12,030 --> 02:11:14,566
<i>Disperse or be fired upon!</i>

1490
02:11:15,918 --> 02:11:17,886
There's only one police
in this town.

1491
02:11:57,183 --> 02:11:58,614
Open fire.

1492
02:12:49,903 --> 02:12:52,005
- Here it comes!
- Get ready!

1493
02:13:21,837 --> 02:13:25,837
So, you came back
to die with your city.

1494
02:13:26,326 --> 02:13:29,766
No. I came back to stop you.

1495
02:13:40,875 --> 02:13:41,840
Now!

1496
02:13:54,877 --> 02:13:56,281
That's impossible.

1497
02:13:58,323 --> 02:13:59,830
Cut over to Fifth!

1498
02:14:13,895 --> 02:14:16,027
Off you go.
Get on the bus. Go ahead.

1499
02:14:16,118 --> 02:14:18,671
You, come with me. You too.

1500
02:14:18,933 --> 02:14:22,019
Hey, you, you, and you,
come 'ere, come 'ere.

1501
02:14:22,312 --> 02:14:24,224
Everyone else
get on the bus, okay?

1502
02:14:24,259 --> 02:14:27,121
You guys... you go knock on doors
and spread the word, okay?

1503
02:14:27,121 --> 02:14:31,139
The bomb is gonna go off. You get out by
the South Street tunnel or over the bridge.

1504
02:14:31,139 --> 02:14:33,973
You go, you do two blocks,
you get back to the bus. All right?

1505
02:14:33,973 --> 02:14:35,473
Go, go! Go!

1506
02:14:35,964 --> 02:14:37,177
Is he back?

1507
02:14:39,051 --> 02:14:40,430
Keep your eyes open.
Go, go.

1508
02:16:02,843 --> 02:16:03,992
Cover the doors!

1509
02:16:07,441 --> 02:16:10,834
Where's your trigger?!
Where is it?!

1510
02:16:11,955 --> 02:16:14,375
You'd never give it
to an ordinary citizen!

1511
02:16:14,749 --> 02:16:17,719
Where is it?
Where's your trigger?!

1512
02:16:18,753 --> 02:16:21,436
Where is it?! Where is it?!

1513
02:16:29,351 --> 02:16:31,300
Tell me where the trigger is.

1514
02:16:31,833 --> 02:16:35,858
Then... you have my permission to die.

1515
02:16:47,737 --> 02:16:49,325
I broke you.

1516
02:16:50,619 --> 02:16:52,494
How have you come back?

1517
02:16:52,766 --> 02:16:57,447
You think you're the only one...
who could learn the strength to escape?

1518
02:16:57,482 --> 02:16:59,116
Where's the trigger?

1519
02:16:59,388 --> 02:17:01,629
But I never escaped.

1520
02:17:02,505 --> 02:17:03,863
But the child...

1521
02:17:05,842 --> 02:17:07,885
The child of Ra's Al Ghul
made the climb.

1522
02:17:08,053 --> 02:17:10,867
But he's not the child of Ra's Al Ghul.

1523
02:17:14,423 --> 02:17:15,426
I am.

1524
02:17:16,144 --> 02:17:18,042
And though I'm not ordinary...

1525
02:17:19,898 --> 02:17:21,699
I'm a citizen.

1526
02:17:41,299 --> 02:17:42,378
Miranda?

1527
02:17:45,575 --> 02:17:46,635
Why?

1528
02:17:47,195 --> 02:17:48,402
Talia.

1529
02:17:49,375 --> 02:17:52,355
My mother named me Talia,
before she was killed...

1530
02:17:52,948 --> 02:17:56,171
the way I would have been killed,
if not for my protector...

1531
02:17:57,400 --> 02:17:58,446
Bane.

1532
02:18:06,125 --> 02:18:07,176
Goodbye.

1533
02:18:09,497 --> 02:18:11,592
I climbed out of the pit.

1534
02:18:17,608 --> 02:18:19,210
I found my father...

1535
02:18:22,353 --> 02:18:25,381
and brought him back
to exact terrible vengeance.

1536
02:18:26,425 --> 02:18:27,894
But by that time...

1537
02:18:29,471 --> 02:18:32,886
the prisoners and doctor had done
their work to my friend.

1538
02:18:33,181 --> 02:18:34,627
My protector.

1539
02:18:38,268 --> 02:18:41,692
The League took us in.
Trained us.

1540
02:18:42,179 --> 02:18:44,709
But my father could not accept Bane.

1541
02:18:45,522 --> 02:18:47,151
He saw only a monster.

1542
02:18:47,319 --> 02:18:53,198
His very existence was a reminder
of the hell he'd left his wife to die in.

1543
02:18:53,703 --> 02:18:57,067
He excommunicated Bane
from the League of Shadows.

1544
02:18:57,102 --> 02:19:01,503
His only crime...
was that he loved me.

1545
02:19:03,251 --> 02:19:06,413
I could not forgive my father.

1546
02:19:10,800 --> 02:19:12,883
Until you murdered him.

1547
02:19:30,320 --> 02:19:35,390
He was trying... to kill...
millions of innocent people.

1548
02:19:36,076 --> 02:19:40,287
Innocent is a strong word
to throw around Gotham, Bruce.

1549
02:19:42,612 --> 02:19:45,317
I honor my father
by finishing his work.

1550
02:19:57,710 --> 02:20:02,782
Vengeance against the man who killed him
is simply a reward for my patience.

1551
02:20:04,080 --> 02:20:05,079
You see...

1552
02:20:06,564 --> 02:20:11,058
it's the slow knife,
the knife that takes its time.

1553
02:20:14,650 --> 02:20:15,757
The knife...

1554
02:20:16,828 --> 02:20:20,432
that waits...
years without forgetting...

1555
02:20:20,614 --> 02:20:24,038
then slips quietly between the bones.

1556
02:20:24,749 --> 02:20:26,041
That's the knife...

1557
02:20:27,377 --> 02:20:28,710
that cuts deepest.

1558
02:20:28,878 --> 02:20:30,235
Please.

1559
02:20:37,794 --> 02:20:40,017
Maybe... your knife...

1560
02:20:40,723 --> 02:20:43,433
- was too slow.
- The truck is under attack.

1561
02:20:43,988 --> 02:20:47,491
Gordon. You gave him
a way to block my signal.

1562
02:20:48,151 --> 02:20:49,205
No matter.

1563
02:20:51,745 --> 02:20:53,885
He's bought Gotham 11 minutes.

1564
02:20:57,915 --> 02:20:58,785
Come on!

1565
02:20:59,993 --> 02:21:00,785
This way!

1566
02:21:07,245 --> 02:21:09,613
<i>Stay there!
What are you doin'?</i>

1567
02:21:09,967 --> 02:21:13,001
Blake, MCU!
I'm gettin' these boys to safety!

1568
02:21:13,001 --> 02:21:14,886
<i>You're gettin' us all killed!</i>

1569
02:21:14,921 --> 02:21:18,228
<i>If anyone crosses this bridge,
they'll blow the city!</i>

1570
02:21:18,263 --> 02:21:21,310
It's gonna blow anyway!
We need to open this bridge, now!

1571
02:21:21,429 --> 02:21:24,941
Detective, if you take one step forward,
we will shoot you!

1572
02:21:25,084 --> 02:21:28,637
If you take two steps forward,
we will blow the bridge!

1573
02:21:30,644 --> 02:21:33,919
Okay, go back by the bus and wait for me,
all right? Just go back and wait.

1574
02:21:37,368 --> 02:21:41,116
Prepare a convoy. We must secure
the bomb until it detonates.

1575
02:21:42,521 --> 02:21:46,057
Don't kill him.
I want him to feel the heat.

1576
02:21:47,255 --> 02:21:52,122
Feel the fire of
12 million souls you failed.

1577
02:21:57,737 --> 02:21:59,209
Goodbye, my friend.

1578
02:22:07,352 --> 02:22:08,753
Goodbye.

1579
02:22:09,484 --> 02:22:12,973
Keep movin' forward!
Flank them at the stairs!

1580
02:22:21,102 --> 02:22:22,219
Shoot them.

1581
02:22:23,581 --> 02:22:24,789
Shoot them all.

1582
02:22:34,187 --> 02:22:37,166
We both know
that I have to kill you now.

1583
02:22:40,635 --> 02:22:43,176
You'll just have
to imagine the fire.

1584
02:22:50,842 --> 02:22:52,618
About the whole no-guns thing...

1585
02:22:53,875 --> 02:22:56,695
I'm not sure I feel
as strongly about it as you do.

1586
02:23:10,459 --> 02:23:11,510
Pull up.

1587
02:23:14,646 --> 02:23:15,886
Stay level.

1588
02:23:28,451 --> 02:23:31,227
We have to force that convoy east
to the entrance to the reactor.

1589
02:23:33,470 --> 02:23:36,739
I need you on the ground.
I'll be in the air. Go!

1590
02:23:36,999 --> 02:23:40,245
The situation has changed.
Your orders are out o' date.

1591
02:23:40,804 --> 02:23:44,113
I'm a cop, like you,
and I'm walkin' out there.

1592
02:23:44,907 --> 02:23:47,147
Please, do not shoot me!

1593
02:23:48,953 --> 02:23:50,560
Shoot at his feet.

1594
02:24:00,089 --> 02:24:02,424
Nothing like a little air superiority.

1595
02:24:02,592 --> 02:24:04,862
Detective! Please, stop!

1596
02:24:05,261 --> 02:24:08,119
Please, detective! Stop!

1597
02:24:08,604 --> 02:24:10,529
Stop walking!

1598
02:24:11,194 --> 02:24:13,876
Blow it! Do it!

1599
02:24:25,294 --> 02:24:28,123
You have to get that bomb here.
And you've got 10 minutes.

1600
02:24:38,825 --> 02:24:41,177
They're pushing us
to the entrance of the reactor.

1601
02:24:41,212 --> 02:24:43,660
They're gonna
try to reconnect the core.

1602
02:24:45,179 --> 02:24:50,213
You idiots! You sons of bitches!
You're killin' us!

1603
02:24:50,515 --> 02:24:52,258
Yeah, follow your orders!

1604
02:24:52,739 --> 02:24:55,088
All right, boys. Get in a circle.
Bow your heads.

1605
02:24:57,866 --> 02:24:58,915
It's on my side.

1606
02:25:47,488 --> 02:25:50,615
Hey, father, let's get everyone
back on the bus, okay? Go, go, go, go!

1607
02:25:50,783 --> 02:25:53,949
- Back on the bus!
- There's nowhere to go.

1608
02:25:55,036 --> 02:25:56,189
On the bus!

1609
02:26:52,539 --> 02:26:55,023
You've got to turn the truck east!

1610
02:26:59,581 --> 02:27:00,775
Stay straight!

1611
02:27:33,234 --> 02:27:36,143
Gimme a hand!
We can get a cable on it!

1612
02:27:43,341 --> 02:27:46,085
Fox showed me
how to override the reactor.

1613
02:27:49,862 --> 02:27:50,891
Oh, dear.

1614
02:27:54,657 --> 02:27:58,053
Including... the emergency flood.

1615
02:28:14,550 --> 02:28:16,798
There's... no way...

1616
02:28:17,418 --> 02:28:18,471
this bomb...

1617
02:28:19,348 --> 02:28:21,076
will be stopped.

1618
02:28:22,314 --> 02:28:23,475
What are you doing?

1619
02:28:23,475 --> 02:28:25,448
Protection from the blast.
We're gonna be all right!

1620
02:28:25,448 --> 02:28:27,416
- Tunnel time. Go!
- It's an atom bomb!

1621
02:28:27,416 --> 02:28:28,587
You think they need
to hear that right now?

1622
02:28:28,587 --> 02:28:30,808
You wanna let 'em die
without hope? C'mon!

1623
02:28:31,090 --> 02:28:32,672
Prepare yourselves.

1624
02:28:34,709 --> 02:28:36,616
My father's... work...

1625
02:28:37,870 --> 02:28:39,066
is done.

1626
02:28:45,380 --> 02:28:48,152
- What are you doing?
- I can get it out over the bay!

1627
02:28:48,798 --> 02:28:50,937
Set it to fly out over the water,
then eject?

1628
02:28:50,972 --> 02:28:52,507
No autopilot.

1629
02:28:54,477 --> 02:28:57,606
You could've gone anywhere,
been anything. But you came back here.

1630
02:28:57,779 --> 02:28:58,944
So did you.

1631
02:28:59,321 --> 02:29:01,153
I guess we're both suckers.

1632
02:29:09,234 --> 02:29:12,171
- I never cared who you were.
- And you were right.

1633
02:29:12,171 --> 02:29:14,569
Shouldn't the people know
the hero who saved them?

1634
02:29:14,737 --> 02:29:15,904
A hero can be anyone.

1635
02:29:16,072 --> 02:29:19,399
Even a man doing simple things,
as simple... and reassuring

1636
02:29:19,399 --> 02:29:21,887
as putting a coat around
a young boy's shoulders...

1637
02:29:22,294 --> 02:29:24,915
to let 'im know
the world hadn't ended.

1638
02:29:42,784 --> 02:29:44,094
Bruce Wayne?

1639
02:29:57,449 --> 02:30:00,815
C'mon! There you go!
Okay, you too. Come on, father.

1640
02:30:19,911 --> 02:30:21,745
Hey, heads down!
This is it!

1641
02:30:21,887 --> 02:30:24,964
- No.
- No! That's Batman!

1642
02:31:13,259 --> 02:31:14,468
That's detonation!

1643
02:31:22,130 --> 02:31:23,875
It's out over the bay!
It's clear of the city!

1644
02:31:43,724 --> 02:31:45,847
"I see a beautiful city..."

1645
02:31:46,555 --> 02:31:48,340
"and a brilliant people..."

1646
02:31:49,085 --> 02:31:51,247
"rising from this abyss."

1647
02:31:52,144 --> 02:31:56,612
"I see the lives... for which
I lay down my life..."

1648
02:31:56,767 --> 02:31:57,757
"peaceful..."

1649
02:31:58,695 --> 02:32:02,276
"useful, prosperous and happy."

1650
02:32:04,538 --> 02:32:08,227
"I see that I hold
a sanctuary in their hearts..."

1651
02:32:10,060 --> 02:32:12,933
"and in the hearts
of their descendants..."

1652
02:32:13,707 --> 02:32:15,762
"generations hence."

1653
02:32:18,129 --> 02:32:21,900
"It is a far, far better thing
that I do..."

1654
02:32:23,217 --> 02:32:25,267
"than I have ever done."

1655
02:32:26,435 --> 02:32:30,518
"It is a far, far better rest
that I go to..."

1656
02:32:33,644 --> 02:32:35,455
"than I have ever known."

1657
02:32:54,063 --> 02:32:56,839
I'm so sorry.
I failed you.

1658
02:32:59,315 --> 02:33:00,774
You trusted me...

1659
02:33:02,464 --> 02:33:03,976
and I failed you.

1660
02:33:07,835 --> 02:33:09,318
Can I change your mind...

1661
02:33:11,849 --> 02:33:13,727
about quitting the force?

1662
02:33:14,896 --> 02:33:18,732
You know what you said about...
structures becomin' shackles?

1663
02:33:19,014 --> 02:33:22,752
You were right,
and I can't take it. The... injustice.

1664
02:33:22,752 --> 02:33:27,189
I mean... no one's ever gonna know
who saved an entire city.

1665
02:33:27,224 --> 02:33:28,328
They know.

1666
02:33:30,454 --> 02:33:31,816
It was the Batman.

1667
02:33:50,051 --> 02:33:53,496
Mr. Wayne's will was not amended
to reflect his more modest estate.

1668
02:33:53,496 --> 02:33:57,258
Nonetheless, there are considerable
assets to... dispose of.

1669
02:33:57,934 --> 02:34:01,271
The contents of the house are to be sold
to settle the estate's accounts

1670
02:34:01,271 --> 02:34:05,652
and the remainder is left in its entirety
to Alfred J. Pennyworth.

1671
02:34:07,488 --> 02:34:11,210
The house and grounds are left
to the city of Gotham on condition

1672
02:34:11,210 --> 02:34:15,306
that they never be demolished,
altered or otherwise interfered with...

1673
02:34:16,112 --> 02:34:19,832
and that they shall be used for
one purpose, and one purpose only:

1674
02:34:21,610 --> 02:34:25,778
the housing and care of the city's
at-risk and orphaned children.

1675
02:34:26,504 --> 02:34:30,601
My clerk can help anyone with
the smaller correspondences and instructions.

1676
02:34:31,156 --> 02:34:32,439
Blake, John.

1677
02:34:32,785 --> 02:34:36,337
- Nothing here.
- Uh, um, try my legal name.

1678
02:34:39,472 --> 02:34:42,092
You should use your full name.
I like that name....

1679
02:34:42,477 --> 02:34:44,329
-  ... Robin.
- Thanks.

1680
02:34:44,457 --> 02:34:46,526
Why do we even worry about
the stabilization software?

1681
02:34:48,969 --> 02:34:49,011
This entire autopilot system's
completely obsolete.

1682
02:34:49,011 --> 02:34:52,300
Please... I just need to know
what I could've done to fix it.

1683
02:34:52,652 --> 02:34:57,160
But... Mr. Fox, i-it's already been fixed.
Software patch. Six months ago.

1684
02:34:57,160 --> 02:34:59,021
Check the ID on the patch.

1685
02:35:01,984 --> 02:35:03,014
Bruce Wayne.

1686
02:35:04,443 --> 02:35:06,617
- Any news on the missing item?
