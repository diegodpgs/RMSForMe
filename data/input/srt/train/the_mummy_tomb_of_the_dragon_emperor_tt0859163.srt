1
00:01:23,322 --> 00:01:24,615
Leave me.

2
00:01:24,698 --> 00:01:26,826
Prepare for war!

3
00:02:14,123 --> 00:02:15,791
Stop! I am not harmed.

4
00:02:23,716 --> 00:02:24,758
We attack tonight!

5
00:04:00,145 --> 00:04:04,233
I have too much to do for one lifetime.

6
00:04:54,325 --> 00:04:55,576
Your Majesty...

7
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,333
Rise up.

8
00:05:05,753 --> 00:05:09,173
I do not possess the secret of
immortality, my Lord...

9
00:05:09,256 --> 00:05:12,218
...but I know where to find it.

10
00:05:13,677 --> 00:05:14,720
General...

11
00:05:17,264 --> 00:05:19,058
No man is to touch her.

12
00:05:19,475 --> 00:05:22,937
She is mine.

13
00:06:04,061 --> 00:06:05,980
This is a key.

14
00:06:39,096 --> 00:06:40,973
You have served me well.

15
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:46,812
I will grant you anything you desire.

16
00:06:48,272 --> 00:06:51,942
I want to spend my life with General Ming.

17
00:06:54,278 --> 00:06:55,779
Of course.

18
00:06:56,363 --> 00:06:57,406
Read.

19
00:07:27,144 --> 00:07:29,563
I feel your spell working.

20
00:07:31,065 --> 00:07:36,821
I am now immortal.

21
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,075
Come, I want to show you something.

22
00:07:56,715 --> 00:08:00,386
Become my queen and I will let him live.

23
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:04,598
Do what he says! Save yourself!

24
00:08:08,602 --> 00:08:10,896
You will never keep your word.

25
00:08:12,523 --> 00:08:13,566
You are right.

26
00:08:27,496 --> 00:08:29,582
Now, join General Ming in hell.

27
00:08:46,265 --> 00:08:47,600
What did you do to me?

28
00:08:48,517 --> 00:08:50,728
I cursed you and your army.

29
00:09:05,326 --> 00:09:06,869
Surround the Palace!

30
00:09:06,994 --> 00:09:08,412
The Emperor is in trouble!

31
00:14:14,635 --> 00:14:17,805
NINGXIA PROVINCE, CHINA

32
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,411
SHANGHAI, CHINA

33
00:26:29,495 --> 00:26:31,455
CHINESE NEW YEAR, 1947

34
00:31:28,711 --> 00:31:31,505
The O'Connells are in Shanghai.

35
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:34,592
Do they have the Eye of Shangri-La?

36
00:31:34,675 --> 00:31:37,052
Our spy says they do.

37
00:31:37,553 --> 00:31:38,596
Good.

38
00:31:38,804 --> 00:31:39,972
Assemble the troops!

39
00:31:40,055 --> 00:31:41,098
Yes sir.

40
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:46,645
Soldiers!

41
00:31:47,229 --> 00:31:50,649
Soon all our training and sacrifice...

42
00:31:51,317 --> 00:31:53,861
will bear great fruit.

43
00:31:54,904 --> 00:31:58,157
It is my dream to raise our Emperor
from his tomb.

44
00:31:58,866 --> 00:32:01,994
Only He can bring order out of this chaos.

45
00:32:03,037 --> 00:32:04,079
Soldiers...

46
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:09,001
tonight our great battle begins!

47
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,107
I live to serve you, my Lord.

48
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,775
I can help you become immortal.

49
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,695
If you are lying, you will burn.

50
00:52:28,888 --> 00:52:31,223
Welcome to the modern world, my Lord.

51
00:52:31,765 --> 00:52:33,684
Why did you raise me?

52
00:52:34,101 --> 00:52:38,314
I love this land.
Only you can lead us back to greatness.

53
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:41,567
What is in it for you?

54
00:52:43,152 --> 00:52:45,946
I want to serve as your general.

55
00:52:46,655 --> 00:52:49,116
The last general I trusted...

56
00:52:49,408 --> 00:52:52,203
betrayed me.

57
00:52:52,786 --> 00:52:55,539
I will not make that mistake.

58
00:53:01,962 --> 00:53:06,509
I cannot escape this curse
until I am immortal...

59
00:53:07,301 --> 00:53:08,803
General.

60
00:53:10,513 --> 00:53:12,515
I understand, my Lord.

61
00:53:12,807 --> 00:53:16,685
We need to find the Pool of Eternal Life.

62
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:21,440
This will point the way.

63
01:00:07,179 --> 01:00:08,931
Clear a path to the Golden Tower.

64
01:02:22,439 --> 01:02:23,983
Set up a crossfire!

65
01:02:24,650 --> 01:02:25,901
Move it!

66
01:03:07,985 --> 01:03:09,403
Please! I need your help!

67
01:03:09,653 --> 01:03:11,697
These soldiers are evil!

68
01:03:32,218 --> 01:03:33,886
Shoot! Kill them!

69
01:07:41,008 --> 01:07:42,968
Shangri-La.

70
01:11:38,829 --> 01:11:39,997
Mother.

71
01:11:41,499 --> 01:11:42,541
My sweet daughter.

72
01:11:51,425 --> 01:11:52,510
I beg you...

73
01:11:54,261 --> 01:11:56,138
My father is dying.

74
01:11:56,597 --> 01:11:57,890
They are my friends.

75
01:13:00,411 --> 01:13:03,956
Where are you going, General?
Our destiny awaits.

76
01:13:45,873 --> 01:13:49,210
I was wrong to involve you in my revenge.

77
01:13:49,752 --> 01:13:51,253
No, mother.

78
01:13:52,338 --> 01:13:54,507
I would do anything for you.

79
01:18:01,253 --> 01:18:04,089
You look tired, you should rest.

80
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:06,258
I'll stay.

81
01:18:07,426 --> 01:18:09,595
Fate is about to deal its final hand.

82
01:18:09,929 --> 01:18:12,181
If we are to defeat the Emperor...

83
01:18:12,515 --> 01:18:16,143
I must ask for one more sacrifice.

84
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:17,812
Anything, mother.

85
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:21,816
Your immortality.

86
01:19:01,438 --> 01:19:03,816
General Ming's daughter.

87
01:19:04,650 --> 01:19:06,986
Your child will be mine.

88
01:22:08,042 --> 01:22:09,210
Grab her.

89
01:22:09,919 --> 01:22:11,629
Guard her with your life.

90
01:22:38,572 --> 01:22:40,199
AWAKE!

91
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:18,547
Today you awake to a world...

92
01:24:19,298 --> 01:24:21,675
in the grip of chaos and corruption.

93
01:24:21,759 --> 01:24:23,844
Open the gates of the past

94
01:24:23,928 --> 01:24:26,472
and free the souls
of the wrongfully damned.

95
01:24:27,181 --> 01:24:29,058
I will restore order...

96
01:24:29,767 --> 01:24:32,061
I will retake what is mine.

97
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:35,397
I will crush any idea of freedom.

98
01:24:35,523 --> 01:24:38,651
In the name of the ancestors
and the righteous,

99
01:24:38,734 --> 01:24:42,112
I sacrifice my immortality
and that of my daughter

100
01:24:42,196 --> 01:24:44,073
so that you may rise this day!

101
01:24:44,198 --> 01:24:46,075
I will slaughter without mercy.

102
01:24:46,408 --> 01:24:48,911
I will conquer without compassion.

103
01:24:49,245 --> 01:24:51,580
I will now lead you past the Great Wall.

104
01:24:51,956 --> 01:24:55,543
Once you cross, you will be indestructible.

105
01:24:56,502 --> 01:25:01,674
Bring down the wrath of the oppressed
on this Emperor and all who follow him!

106
01:25:02,174 --> 01:25:04,301
I raised you for one purpose...

107
01:25:04,593 --> 01:25:07,346
to enforce my will on the entire world!

108
01:25:08,013 --> 01:25:09,473
Long live the Emperor!

109
01:25:12,059 --> 01:25:15,437
I call upon the hundreds and the thousands

110
01:25:15,521 --> 01:25:20,401
that you may rise up and seize this moment
to take your victory,

111
01:25:20,484 --> 01:25:24,280
to take your justice
and to take your revenge!

112
01:25:43,299 --> 01:25:44,842
Zi Yuan.

113
01:25:51,223 --> 01:25:52,808
It's General Ming!

114
01:25:53,267 --> 01:25:54,894
Follow General Ming!

115
01:25:59,190 --> 01:26:02,318
Prepare for battle!

116
01:26:53,869 --> 01:26:57,998
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

117
01:27:00,835 --> 01:27:02,419
Archers form up!

118
01:27:41,584 --> 01:27:43,210
Death to General Ming!

119
01:27:47,214 --> 01:27:48,591
Charge!

120
01:28:17,787 --> 01:28:20,247
We can't let them cross the wall!

121
01:29:46,959 --> 01:29:48,377
You are no longer immortal.

122
01:34:06,677 --> 01:34:07,761
Get in!

123
01:34:08,637 --> 01:34:11,348
The O'Connells are going to
stop the Emperor!

124
01:35:23,379 --> 01:35:25,840
I dug you up...

125
01:35:26,757 --> 01:35:29,218
and I'm gonna put you down.

126
01:37:03,270 --> 01:37:04,355
Let go!

127
01:37:04,438 --> 01:37:05,523
Never!

128
01:39:16,570 --> 01:39:18,322
The Emperor is dead.

129
01:39:18,614 --> 01:39:20,282
The Emperor is dead!
