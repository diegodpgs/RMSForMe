ÿÿÿ? Running away with me ?

295
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,094
? It was just my imagination ?

296
00:16:19,094 --> 00:16:23,482
ÿÿÿ? Running away with me ?

297
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,986
ÿÿÿ? Running away with me ?

298
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:31,490
ÿÿ- ? Running away with me ?
ÿÿ- ? Just my imagination ?

299
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,494
ÿÿ- ? Running away with me ?
ÿÿ- ? Just my imagination ?

300
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,998
ÿÿÿ? Running away ??

301
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,666
Are you insane?
What are you doing?

302
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,251
ÿÿOh, God, what is this?

303
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,703
ÿÿI didn't want to,
ÿÿbut I will call the police.

304
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,705
ÿI'm sleeping. It's a dream.

305
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:50,209
ÿIt's one of those dreams
ÿand you know you're dreaming.

306
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,627
How do you keep
getting in here?

307
00:16:51,627 --> 00:16:53,345
ÿIt's you who's in here.

308
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,630
Oh, my.

309
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,932
This is more serious
than I thought.

310
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,267
ÿÿÿGo away, you don't exist.

311
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,269
I'm gonna ask
a series of questions.

312
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,271
I want you
to answer honestly.

313
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,190
Has your recent
alcohol consumption increased?

314
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,608
ÿÿÿYeah, so?

315
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,311
ÿÿÿSo are you hearing voices
ÿÿÿor seeing things

316
00:17:09,311 --> 00:17:10,729
ÿthat aren't quite real to you?

317
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,781
ÿÿÿAs a matter of fact, yeah.

318
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:16,151
Have you recently sought
consult from a mental
health professional?

319
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:18,954
ÿÿWhat? How do you know that?
ÿÿStay away from me.

320
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,290
Do you often feel paranoid,
like people are out to get you?

321
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,375
ÿWhy are you asking me
ÿso many questions?

322
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,795
I'll take that as a yes.
Listen to me.

323
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,298
ÿÿYou have fantasized,
ÿÿquite convincingly,

324
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,800
ÿÿthat you've rented
ÿÿan apartment that, in fact,

325
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,169
ÿÿÿbelongs to somebody else.

326
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:36,422
Pick up that pillow.

327
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,424
Pick it up. It's OK.

328
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,592
There's a small red stain
on the back

329
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:43,062
where I once spilled
cherry cough syrup.

330
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,148
Yes, that's it.
How else would I know that?

331
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,650
Or the fact that these sheets
that you're now soiling

332
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,102
are from Nordstrom.

333
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,571
I still have the receipt,
it's in that drawer there.

334
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,074
Open it up and check.

335
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,860
I think you need to
come to terms with the fact

336
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,695
that you may be mentally ill.

337
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,499
ÿÿÿ- Really?
ÿÿÿ- Yes.

338
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,118
This is my apartment.
These are my sheets.

339
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,455
That's my nightstand.
That's my picture...

340
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:13,876
ÿ- Where's my picture?
ÿ- What picture?

341
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:16,845
ÿÿÿThere was a picture there
ÿÿÿof my...

342
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:20,299
There was a picture
right there on the nightstand.

343
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,717
That was empty when I moved in.

344
00:18:21,717 --> 00:18:23,135
ÿÿÿIt was just there.

345
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:26,105
OK, you know what? I've had
enough. I am calling the police.

346
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,607
ÿÿÿ- No, no, no, no.
ÿÿÿ- It's too late.

347
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,395
ÿÿÿWhat'd you do to my phone?

348
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,199
Why can't I...?

349
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,620
ÿYou stay right there.

350
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,072
ÿI'm gonna use the one
ÿin the kitchen.

351
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,714
ÿÿÿHey, Grace,
ÿÿÿDavid Abbott here.

352
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,217
ÿÿÿUh, the people who sublet
ÿÿÿthis apartment to me,

353
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,137
ÿÿ- do you have their number?
ÿÿ- Why? Is something wrong?

354
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:02,007
Uh, no, no. I was just wondering
about the previous tenant,
that's all. Just wondering.

355
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,310
ÿÿOh, well, you know,
ÿÿthe woman that I dealt with,

356
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,930
she didn't wanna talk about it.
It was some kind of tragedy
in the family.

357
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:11,817
ÿÿÿI didn't press for details
ÿÿÿ'cause I don't need
ÿÿÿany more drama.

358
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:15,070
ÿ- So you think this girl died?
ÿ- Well, you better hope so.

359
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,573
ÿÿÿ'Cause that's the only way
ÿÿÿthey're gonna get off

360
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,526
ÿÿÿthis month-to-month thing
ÿÿÿand give you a real lease.

361
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:23,662
- That's not the reason I was...
- Come on, David, grow up.

362
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,664
ÿÿLook, it has a view,
ÿÿit has a fireplace.

363
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,451
ÿÿPeople would kill their
ÿÿgrandmothers for a lot less
ÿÿin this city. [chuckles]

ÿÿÿI Put A Spell On You]

365
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,797
ÿÿÿ? I put a spell on you ?

366
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:50,856
? Because you're mine ?

367
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:59,615
ÿÿ? Stop the things you do ?

368
00:20:00,983 --> 00:20:03,368
- Can I help you with anything?
- No.

369
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,705
I mean, do you
believe in this stuff?

370
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,992
ÿÿWell, you don't...
ÿÿuntil you do.

371
00:20:09,992 --> 00:20:11,493
ÿÿThat's a little dated.

372
00:20:11,994 --> 00:20:13,912
ÿÿÿI recommend
ÿÿÿthe Rosemary Preston.

373
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:15,414
ÿÿÿIt's totally seminal.

374

'Scuse me.
Where's your UFO section?

375
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,419
It's back
and to the left.

376
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,972
Ufology. It's not
even a real science.

00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,341
ÿSo, what kind of
ÿencounter have you had?

378
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:28,727
ÿÿ- Encounter?
ÿÿ- Ectoplasm?

379
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,679
ÿÿÿSoniferous ether?

380
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:34,149
ÿÿÿI have a killer s?ance book
ÿÿÿif you're into communication.

00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:37,603
Uh, communicating

ÿÿI have exactly
ÿÿwhat you need.

384
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,413
ÿÿÿYeah.

385
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,918

ÿÿOK.

00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:28,820
ÿÿÿI've got a hot, moist
ÿÿÿcup of coffee in my hand.

395
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,323
ÿÿThere is no coaster
ÿÿon this table.

396

ÿÿÿI'm going to set it down

ÿÿÿ- Ah!

398
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:39,748
We... We need to talk.

399
00:21:39,748 --> 00:21:43,251
ÿ- About what?
ÿ- Um...

400
00:21:43,251 --> 00:21:45,754
Has it crossed your mind
that there might be something

401
00:21:46,254 --> 00:21:50,175
a little off about the way
you've been spending your days?

402
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:54,012
Actually, yes. It's weird having
a squatter in your living room.

403
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:55,847
I am not...

404
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,400
OK, let's start over.

405
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,402
Hi, I'm David Abbott.

406
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,354
And you are...?

407
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:04,856
ÿI am, uh...

408
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:09,077
ÿÿÿI'm Elizabeth.
ÿÿÿMy name is Elizabeth.

409
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,497
You... You didn't know that.
You... you had to read that.

410
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,200
ÿI think I know my own name.

411
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,503
OK. When was the last time
that you remember

412
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,373
actually talking
to someone other than me?

413
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,792
ÿÿThe other day.
ÿÿThe other day.

414
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:26,294
And... And when
you're not here,

415
00:22:26,795 --> 00:22:29,798
what do you do
with the rest of your day?

416
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:33,051
ÿÿÿWell, certainly a lot more
ÿÿÿthan you do, that's for sure.

417
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:34,853
Let's not stray
from the point, Lizzie.

418
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,222
Don't call me Lizzie.
I'm not in kindergarten.

419
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:40,142
ÿÿ- My name's Elizabeth.
ÿÿ- You think. Let me ask you,

420
00:22:40,142 --> 00:22:43,111
has anything, uh, dramatic
happened to you recently?

421
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,229
ÿÿLike what?

422
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,782
I don't know,
like dying maybe?

423
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,650
How dare you say that to me?

424
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:49,568
OK, calm down.

425
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:52,237
ÿÿÿGet your hands off of me,
ÿÿÿyou pervert!

426
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:54,740
ÿÿÿCalm down. I'm not...
ÿÿÿI'm not here to hurt you.

427
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,075
ÿI'm trying to help you
ÿface the fact that...

428
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,660
ÿÿÿ- I'm not dead.
ÿÿÿ- Look around you.

429
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:00,662
ÿThere should be
ÿa bright light nearby.

430
00:23:00,662 --> 00:23:03,081
ÿ- There's no light.
ÿ- Walk into the light,
ÿElizabeth!

431
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,467
ÿÿÿThere is no light!
ÿÿÿI am not dead!

432
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,887
I think I would know
if I was dead!

433
00:23:09,838 --> 00:23:11,840
[gasps]

434
00:23:12,841 --> 00:23:14,676
What's happening to me?

435
00:23:14,676 --> 00:23:15,894
ÿÿYou're dead!

436
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,562
ÿÿÿStop saying that!

437
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,098
ÿÿ- Missed.
ÿÿ- [grunting]

438
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:24,186
OK. OK, that's enough.
That's enough.

439
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,938
You're just giving me
a headache! Get off of me!

440
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:28,356
OK. All right, all right.

441
00:23:28,356 --> 00:23:29,825
It's not my fault
you're the way you are.

442
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,660
I just want you

I've tried to be nice,

ÿÿOoh! A butter dish.

Hey, you want bells and whistles

Oh, come on.
He can't see me, either.

479
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:46,161
For some hideous reason,
only you can.

OK, there's somethin'.
Definitely a presence.

Tell me more.

ÿÿÿ- I'm not moving!
ÿÿÿ- Why not?

494
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,993
It's not like it's

ÿ- What?
ÿ- Yes, it is.

496
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,446
ÿÿ- It's got a view.
ÿÿ- And a fireplace.

Whatever, dude.

ÿYo, do you have,

ÿÿÿI'm, like,

"Could you please
talk to her?"

ÿÿ- I'm ignoring you.
ÿÿ- I'm ignoring you.

507
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,944
She won't accept
that she's dead.

508
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:56,064
ÿÿI told her to walk to the
ÿÿlight. She wouldn't do it.

00:26:56,064 --> 00:26:57,565
ÿÿÿThat's because
ÿÿÿthere is no light.

God, you're infuriating!

511

Wait, what's goin' on?

ÿÿÿBlah, blah, blah.

00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,407
You know what?
Do you think I like this?

514
00:27:05,407 --> 00:27:06,908
ÿÿÿDo you think this
ÿÿÿis easy for me?

515
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:10,328
ÿÿÿI know something's different,
ÿÿÿsomething is not right.

00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:12,631
ÿÿ- I'm walking through walls.
ÿÿ- You know,

517
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:13,915
I don't think
I can help you.

518
00:27:13,915 --> 00:27:17,419
This is one of the most alive
spirits I've ever been around.

519
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:19,838
ÿÿ- She's not goin' anywhere.
ÿÿ- What do you mean?

520
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:23,174
I agree with her, dude.
She's not dead.

521
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,430
But you, whoa.

522
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:31,316
You gotta deal with this...

523
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:38,990
'Cause seriously, that's like
the darkest aura I've ever seen.

Suckin' the life right outta
you. It's killin' you, man.

525
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,996
You have
to let her go, dude.

526
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:48,366
ÿÿÿHow can I,
ÿÿÿwhen she won't leave?

527
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:50,168
Not your spirit girl.

528
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,087
I'm talkin' 'bout
the other one.

529
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,039
The one you're
keepin' in here.

530
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:57,625
That's what's really
haunting you, isn't it?

531
00:27:57,625 --> 00:28:00,211
- I don't wanna talk about that.
- [chuckles] Oh, I get it.

532
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,213
You were dumped.

533
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:05,550
Probably for some guy
who doesn't have a couch
fused to his ass.

534
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,434
Shut up.

535
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,436
You can dish it out
but you can't take it?

536
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,557
ÿYou bring Father Flanagan
ÿand the Joy Luck Club in here
ÿto get rid of me.

537
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:14,526
But I talk about you
getting dumped once...

538
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:18,563
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.
Shut the hell up!

539
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,615
Sorry for your loss, bro.

ÿÿÿA word to the wise, girl.

541
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,206
ÿÿÿShow some respect

I'm sorry.

544
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:49,260
It occurred
to me now that I...

545
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,647
...probably don't
know you all that well.

546
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,318
I got this place for the roof.

547
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,272
ÿÿÿI was gonna do
ÿÿÿa whole garden out here...

...eventually,
I think.

549
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,611
Now I'm babbling.

550
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:08,113
I, uh...

551
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,032
I'm really sorry.

552
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:13,952
Most people who deal with loss

553
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,421
ÿreally find it helpful
ÿto talk about things.

ÿÿI don't wanna talk about it!

555
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,625
Anger works too.

00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:25,346
ÿÿÿWho was he talking about?

557
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,766
ÿÿÿLaura. Her name was Laura.

00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,684
ÿÿWho's Laura?

559
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,636
She was my wife.

560
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,195
What do you
think I am, stupid?

561
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,564
What is this?
Oh, come on.

Don't. This is

564
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,708
How would you know? Have you
ever been in a bar in your life?

Um... So you OK?

Say goodbye, walk to the door,

ÿÿ- Sleep? You gettin' any?

587
00:30:48,796 --> 00:30:49,714
Eight hours.

589

Opium addicts

ÿWhy are you still here?

00:31:56,948 --> 00:32:00,785
That's a scary question.
I have no idea.

608
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:02,587
Why are you the only one
that can see me?

ÿDon't ask me.

All I know is
when I'm not with you,

ÿÿOh, my God.

I mean, then I'd
know once and for all.

620
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,908
I'm trying
to figure it out. I...

624
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,835
Look.

625
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:52,837
You have two realities
to choose from.

626
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:55,840
First one being that a woman
has come into your life

627
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,342
in a very unconventional way

628
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:59,344
and she happens
to need your assistance.

629
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:00,845
ÿÿRight.

630
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:03,348
The second one is that
you're an insane person,

631
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,850
sitting on a park bench
talking to yourself.

632
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:10,188
I think I prefer
the first one.

633
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:12,023
OK.

634
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:13,408
Let's find out who I am.

ÿÿ- Nobody live there.

Finally, somebody normal.
I bet we were friends.

ÿHi, I'm... I'm David.
ÿI am a new tenant here.

ÿHi, David, Katrina.
ÿCome on in.

ÿ- She's friendly, I like her.
ÿ- This'll just take a sec.

645
00:33:44,972 --> 00:33:49,110
ÿÿÿI have a question.
ÿÿÿThe apartment upstairs,
ÿÿÿit belonged to a young woman.

00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,112
ÿYeah, I think there
ÿwas somebody up there.

647
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,614
ÿÿBut she was, like,
ÿÿtotally antisocial.

648
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:56,067
OK, maybe we
weren't close friends.

649
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,986
ÿÿKinda like a cat lady,
ÿÿbut without any cats.

650
00:33:59,487 --> 00:34:00,788
ÿÿRight?

651
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,707
OK, I think we're done here.
Let's go.

652
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,992
ÿÿÿ- OK, thank you.
ÿÿÿ- Look. This is so retro,

653
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,545
ÿÿÿbut I've got a window
ÿÿÿI can't get open.

654
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:09,831
ÿÿÿ- She's got to be kidding.
ÿÿÿ- What?

655
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:10,798
- What?
- What?

656
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,800
She wants you to come in.

657
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,302
ÿÿWell, if it's painted shut

but I have dinner plans.

Well, I got dessert.

663
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,318

00:34:38,693 --> 00:34:40,995
Why is she wearing
workout clothes?

669
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,331
If you were gonna work out
in the middle of the day,

670
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,333
the only reason
to wear workout clothes,

671
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,335
do you really need
a push-up bra?

ÿÿThe whole point's
ÿÿto strap 'em down.

ÿ- Why? Something might
ÿjog my memory.

674
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:54,876
Too bad.
You're like an AM radio

675
00:34:54,876 --> 00:34:57,762
that someone shoved in my head
and I can't turn off.

676
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,098
You don't think she was
completely un-classy

677
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,466
ÿand predatory?

678
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:04,185
ÿThose happen to be
ÿtwo of men's favorite things.

679
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,436
Why don't you
date a pit bull?

680
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,888
Maybe I will.

681
00:35:06,888 --> 00:35:08,890
ÿÿÿ- Damn it!
ÿÿÿ- What?

682
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:12,393
[sighing] I locked my key
in the apartment.

683
00:35:12,393 --> 00:35:14,896
There's a spare key
under the fire extinguisher.

684
00:35:14,896 --> 00:35:19,150
I guess she's sexy if you're
into that whole tall, big boobs,

ÿÿI guess if you
ÿÿwanna be that guy.

Look, there are five
other units here,

688
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:28,326
and not one person even
remembers what you look like.

disconnected from people.

ÿ- Are you sure you want that?
ÿ- Oh, yes, I'm sure.

691
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,335
Next drawer on the left.

692
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,723
ÿÿÿThere's a funnel in there
ÿÿÿtoo, if you need it.

693
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,728

- What is it?

694
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:48,729
New leads.

695
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:51,232
Look, there's an address
written on here.

696
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,734
I can't make that out.
Is that a five or a six?

697
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,436
ÿÿÿUm, I think it's a...

698
00:35:55,436 --> 00:35:57,905
ÿÿNo, no, no, that's a five.
ÿÿDefinitely a five.

699
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,857
So we have an address,
a dry cleaning ticket

700
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:02,743
ÿÿÿand a book of matches.
ÿÿÿYou know what that means?

701
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,779
We could start
a very small fire?

ÿÿArmani, I believe.

705
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:12,670
Yes. I remember them.
They were expensive.

706
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,340
Do you remember anything else
about the woman? It's important.

707
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,459
She's pleasant,
but a little dull maybe.

708
00:36:18,459 --> 00:36:20,044
- Dull?
- Dull?

ÿI think of her, I think
ÿof sadness, loneliness.

710
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,384
I don't need a psychological
profile from this guy.

711
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:28,886
ÿÿ- Can we just get the pants?
ÿÿ- Can I get the pants?

712
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,106
ÿÿItem left too long.
ÿÿWe give them
ÿÿto homeless shelter.

713
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:34,725
Gave away my pants?
Are you insane?
They were Armani.

714
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:38,196
OK, let's go.

ÿÿÿ- Can I help you?
ÿÿÿ- Hi.

723
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:16,317
This might sound a little odd,
but I was wondering if you knew
a certain woman.

724
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,736
ÿÿBlond,
ÿÿabout five-foot-one...

ÿÿÿ- Two. And a half.
ÿÿÿ- Two and a half?

726

Oh, my God. Who are you?

ÿÿI don't know you. I...

- Did my wife hire you?
- I'm sorry, what?

729
00:37:27,862 --> 00:37:29,196
I knew she'd find out.

730
00:37:29,697 --> 00:37:31,699
Whatever she's payin' you,
I'll double it.

731

ÿÿ- Anything you want.
ÿÿ- I'm not looking for money.

- That's her.
Come back around six.

ÿÿWow.

Well, look
on the bright side.

At 6:00,
I'm coming into some money.

00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,456
Oh, my God.

742
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,959
Maybe I was a slut.

743
00:38:15,409 --> 00:38:18,296
A lonely,
home-wrecking slut.

744
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:30,224
I mean, seriously.
So, what if I was a slut?

745
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:33,511
- There's nothing wrong
with a sexual appetite.
- Not at all.

746
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:36,347
Look who I'm talking to,
Mr. Tried To Feel Me Up.

747
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:38,849
ÿÿI'm trying
ÿÿto agree with you.

748
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:40,151
- [gasps] David.
- What?

749
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,519
This is it.

750
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,604
You recognize it? Good.

751
00:38:43,604 --> 00:38:45,606
ÿÿOK. Come on.

752
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:53,531
This is Moose's.
I loved this restaurant.

753
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:55,533
ÿ- You ate here a lot.
ÿ- No.

754
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:57,368
ÿ- No.
ÿ- I never did.

755
00:38:57,368 --> 00:39:00,705
I remember looking
in that window and wishing
I could eat in here.

756
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:04,125
ÿÿWhat, were you a homeless
ÿÿstreet urchin? Why didn't you?

757
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:07,845
I wanted to, I just
never got around to it.

758
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,632
Maybe the dry-cleaner guy
was right about me.

759
00:39:11,632 --> 00:39:13,300
ÿHello, can I help you?

760
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,770
ÿNo, thank you.
ÿMaybe some other time.

761
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,472
ÿÿ[man] Kenny!

762
00:39:18,472 --> 00:39:20,858
Ivan, call 911,
we need an ambulance!

763
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,777
- [woman 1] You OK?
- [woman 2] Undo his collar.

764
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,061
ÿÿÿ- Is he breathing?
ÿÿÿ- I can't tell.

765
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:27,898
ÿ- We should do mouth-to-mouth.
ÿ- [man] God. We need a doctor.

766
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:29,400
We really have to find a doctor.

767
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,902
Is there a doctor here?
Anyone?

768
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:33,904
ÿÿÿ- Feel his chest.
ÿÿÿ- [David] What?

769
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:36,323
His chest,
check and see if it's bloated.

770
00:39:36,323 --> 00:39:38,909
ÿÿ- How would I know?
ÿÿ- Just do it!

771
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:42,496
ÿÿÿExcuse me. Pardon me.
ÿÿÿI need to feel his chest.

772
00:39:42,496 --> 00:39:43,798
ÿÿCan you feel his ribs?

773
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,133
ÿÿNo, but I can if I press down.

774
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,335
- What are you doing?
- Does he feel bloated?

775
00:39:48,335 --> 00:39:49,303
ÿÿ- Mmm... I think so.
ÿÿ- Think what?

776
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,889
ÿÿÿTell them you'll need
ÿÿÿa sharp paring knife

777
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,391
ÿÿand a bottle of vodka.

778
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,010
ÿÿI need a sharp paring knife
ÿÿand a bottle of vodka.

779
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,261
- Ivan?
- Yeah, got it.

780
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:59,480
- What's wrong?
- It's a tension pneumothorax.

781
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,016
ÿÿ- It's a tension nemothaxer.
ÿÿ- Pneumothorax.

782
00:40:02,016 --> 00:40:03,684
- Pneumothaxer.
- Pneumothorax.

783
00:40:03,684 --> 00:40:04,568
- Pneumathurman.
- Never mind.

784
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,438
ÿÿÿ- Never mind!
ÿÿÿ- But what is it?

785
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:10,191
ÿÿÿAir is escaping out of
ÿÿÿthe lungs into his chest.

786
00:40:10,191 --> 00:40:11,692
...out of his lungs
into his chest.

787
00:40:11,692 --> 00:40:13,611
ÿÿÿ- Open his shirt.
ÿÿÿ- Open his shirt.

788
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,029
- No, you do it.
- I'll do it.

789
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,948
ÿA valve at the opening of the
ÿlungs. If it doesn't close,

790
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:21,619
ÿÿit constricts the lungs
ÿÿand compresses the organs.

791
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:24,622
I want you to feel for his ribs
again. A little bit lower.

792
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,674
ÿÿThe spot between two ribs,
ÿÿdo you feel that?

793
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,176
ÿÿÿOK, splash
ÿÿÿsome vodka on it.

794
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,929
ÿÿ- All right. Get the knife.
ÿÿ- OK.

795
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,550
Uh, can I ask everyone just
to stand back a little bit here?

796
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:39,353
A little bit further, please.
A little bit further. Thank you.

797
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:42,807
ÿÿ- What am I doing
ÿÿwith the knife?
ÿÿ- Make an incision.

798
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:44,692
You know what? No.

799
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:48,195
ÿ- This man's life is at stake.
ÿ- I... I can't stab a man.

800
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,197
ÿOK. There's nothing
ÿto be afraid of.

801
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:53,117
ÿÿÿYou're gonna make
ÿÿÿa hole for the air to escape.

802
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,069
So put the knife
on that spot.

803
00:40:55,569 --> 00:40:57,071
Oh, my God.
How do you know this?

804
00:40:57,071 --> 00:41:00,124
ÿI don't know, I just do.
ÿNow do it! Put the knife there.

805
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:03,127
ÿÿÿNow, you're gonna need
ÿÿÿto push harder than that.

806
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:04,745
ÿ- A little bit harder.
ÿ- Oh, God!

807
00:41:04,745 --> 00:41:06,747
ÿÿOK! OK, good!
ÿÿThat's enough.

808
00:41:06,747 --> 00:41:09,550
ÿAll right, now, take the
ÿpourer out of the vodka bottle.

809
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,669
ÿÿ- What?
ÿÿ- You're doing good. Now...

810
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:12,970
Hold on.

811
00:41:16,757 --> 00:41:19,260
ÿ- Go.
ÿ- Put the pourer
ÿin the hole you made.

812
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,728
ÿWhat?

813
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,730
ÿIt's gonna keep the wound open
ÿso air can escape. Do it!

814
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,483
ÿÿÿ- I can't.
ÿÿÿ- Do it.

815
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:30,404
- He's breathing.
- [David] He's breathing!

816
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:31,772
He's breathing!

817
00:41:32,273 --> 00:41:33,607
ÿI'm a doctor.

818
00:41:33,607 --> 00:41:34,492
ÿI'm a doctor!

819
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,610
I know. Thank God.

820
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:38,078
The ambulance
will be here right away.

821
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,531
ÿÿÿ[Elizabeth] Ask him where
ÿÿÿthe nearest hospital is.

822
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:42,616
Do you know where
the nearest hospital is?

823
00:41:42,616 --> 00:41:44,451
A few blocks,
St. Matthews.

824
00:41:44,451 --> 00:41:46,287
- Thank you.
- St. Matthews?

825
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:49,840
I may have been a homewrecking
whore, but I saved lives.

826
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,342
David, I worked
in that hospital.

827
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,843
I know it,
it sounds so familiar.

828
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:55,846
ÿÿÿ- I've never saved a life.
ÿÿÿ- It's the best.

829
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,849
One minute you're looking
at this monitor,
it says "game over,"

830
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,852
then you bring it back,
a little blip and it's there!

831
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:04,855
ÿ- What's that?
ÿ- That's just a little blood.

832
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,358
ÿÿÿ- [groans]
ÿÿÿ- [thuds]

833
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,193
ÿDavid?

834
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,867
ÿ- I work here.
ÿ- You did?

835
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,870
ÿÿThe receptionist,
ÿÿher name is Amita.

836
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,822
ÿIt's all coming
ÿback to me now.

837
00:42:21,822 --> 00:42:23,908
ÿÿThere's Bill and Karen

838
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:26,327
ÿÿand Michael and, uh...

839
00:42:26,327 --> 00:42:29,713
ÿElizabeth?
ÿYou mean Elizabeth Masterson?

840
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,131
Masterson.
Yes, that's my name.

841
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:33,417
Yes, that's it.
Elizabeth Masterson.

842
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:37,755
Dr. Masterson is, um...

843
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:41,675
...is not active
on our staff right now.

844
00:42:41,675 --> 00:42:44,011
Hold on.
Let me talk to someone.

845
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:46,730
Excuse me, doctor?

846
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,649
ÿÿOh, no, she's got the tone.

847
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,067
ÿÿ- What tone?
ÿÿ- The tone.

848
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,518
ÿÿÿWhen you're trying
ÿÿÿto pass the buck

849
00:42:51,518 --> 00:42:54,104
ÿonto somebody else
ÿto tell you your friend died!

850
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:56,607
Excuse me, sir.

851
00:42:56,607 --> 00:43:00,527
I need you to go to
the third-floor nurses' station.

852
00:43:02,529 --> 00:43:05,332
Oh, no, it's Fran.
She's my mentor.

853
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:07,251
They wouldn't send us up here
if it wasn't bad.

854
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,752
ÿÿ- [Fran] Mr. Abbott?
ÿÿ- Hi, yes.

855
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,204
ÿÿ- Fran Lo.
ÿÿ- Nice to meet you.

856
00:43:10,204 --> 00:43:13,007
You've been inquiring
about Elizabeth Masterson?

857
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:16,043
Right. Could you tell me
what happened to her?

858
00:43:16,043 --> 00:43:18,462
First I need to know
your relationship with her.

859
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:21,548
ÿTell her you're my boyfriend.
ÿShe can't tell you anything

860
00:43:21,548 --> 00:43:24,385
ÿÿunless she knows
ÿÿwe're intimately connected.

861
00:43:24,385 --> 00:43:27,354
We were romantic
with each other.

862
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:30,441
- What do you mean?
- Boyfriend-girlfriend.

863
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,443
I know what romantic means,

864
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:35,446
but I... I have
a hard time believing that.

865
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,398
ÿÿ- What? Why?
ÿÿ- What? Why?

866
00:43:37,398 --> 00:43:40,284
Elizabeth's whole life
was this hospital.

867
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,652
"Was"? Did she say "was"?

868
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:43,988
I don't know of a single date
she'd ever been on.

869
00:43:44,405 --> 00:43:47,791
ÿÿWe were fairly recent.
ÿÿI live in her apartment...

870
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,660
ÿÿ- David.
ÿÿ- Building.

871
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,546
So, you don't know
about the accident.

872
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:54,915
ÿÿÿ[David] Accident.

873
00:43:55,749 --> 00:43:58,636
Oh, God, David.
I remember it.

874
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,971
ÿIt was awful.

875
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,141
I was... I've been away.

876
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,926
It was three months ago.

877
00:44:05,926 --> 00:44:08,429
ÿÿÿ- [heart beating]
ÿÿÿ- Three months.

878
00:44:08,929 --> 00:44:10,848
ÿÿI'm sorry.

879
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:14,818
I was away for awhile
on a business trip.

880
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:23,744
ÿ[beating intensifies]

ÿÿOh, my God.

883
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:57,695
What was that?
You were, like, flying.

884
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:03,117
ÿOh, my God. It's you.

885
00:45:04,985 --> 00:45:06,487
It's you,
it's really you.

886
00:45:06,487 --> 00:45:08,989
You're... you're not dead,
you're alive.

00:45:08,989 --> 00:45:11,909
I know, David, but I'm
in a coma. This is not good.

888
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:13,827
Well, it's way better than dead.

889
00:45:13,827 --> 00:45:16,246
Look at you.
Your body is healing, it's...

890
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:19,166
You don't have any scars.
You look pretty.

891
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,636
ÿIt doesn't matter how I look.

892
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,639
ÿÿÿThree months,
ÿÿÿthat's a persistent coma.

893
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:28,008
ÿÿÿOK, well, we're here now.
ÿÿÿLet's do something.

894
00:45:28,008 --> 00:45:29,393
ÿÿLike what?

895
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,679
Like... I don't know.
You're the doctor.

896
00:45:32,679 --> 00:45:34,515
ÿRight. Right.

897
00:45:37,017 --> 00:45:38,152
ÿÿ- Forget it.
ÿÿ- What?

898
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,653
ÿÿI was gonna
ÿÿsay that we...

899
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:42,740
ÿÿÿI need to find a way
ÿÿÿto put myself together again.

900
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:46,360
ÿOK, good, good. That's great.
ÿHow do we do that?

901
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,412
ÿÿMaybe I should
ÿÿtry this.

902
00:45:53,534 --> 00:45:54,785
Something's happening!

903
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:57,121
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
I think it's working!

904
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:59,123
ÿÿÿYeah? No.

905
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:01,125
ÿÿÿLet me try again.

906
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,709
ÿÿI mean, really focus on it.

907
00:46:02,709 --> 00:46:04,711
Hold on inside there.

908
00:46:08,382 --> 00:46:10,467
ÿÿÿI'm not sticking.

909
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:12,770
ÿIt's like I'm no longer
ÿconnected to this body.

910
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:16,356
All right, all right, all right,
all right. Turn around.

911
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:18,475
ÿÿÿ- What?
ÿÿÿ- I want to try something.

912
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:19,860
ÿÿOK.

913
00:46:26,733 --> 00:46:28,118
You felt that.

914
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:29,369
My hand tingled.

915
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:32,039
You are still connected
to your body.

916
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,540
ÿÿÿThe monitor doesn't agree.

917
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,992
Machines don't know everything.

918
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,661
ÿÿÿEverything in my training
ÿÿÿtells me they do.

919
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:39,913
Then how are we having
this conversation?

920
00:46:39,913 --> 00:46:42,049
- I don't know.
- [door opens]

921
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,751
Mr. Abbott? I'm sorry.
I have an appointment,

922
00:46:45,252 --> 00:46:47,671
and I can't leave you
here unattended.

923
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:50,140
Can I just have a couple
more minutes, please?

924
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,258
ÿI'm saying goodbye.

925
00:46:51,258 --> 00:46:53,677
ÿÿ- Of course.
ÿÿ- Thank you.

926
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:56,480
ÿÿÿMy nieces must have
ÿÿÿmade these things for me.

927
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,266
Wow, that's
an amazing likeness.

928
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:01,185
ÿÿ[Elizabeth chuckles]

929
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:03,103
Look at this.

930
00:47:03,437 --> 00:47:06,106
ÿThat's the picture
ÿfrom my nightstand.

931
00:47:06,106 --> 00:47:07,491
Abby must have brought it.

932
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,909
You look great.

933
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:13,697
Look at me now.

934
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:17,534
These levels
aren't changing, David.

935
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:20,037
If anything,
they're decreasing.

936
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:22,539
ÿÿHey, um...

937
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:25,375
- I'm gonna have to leave soon.
- All right.

938
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:28,045
Want me to wait
downstairs in the lobby?

939
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:31,348
ÿNo, no, that's sweet.
ÿYou should go.

940
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,716
Thank you
for helping me.

941
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:35,185
ÿÿIt was my pleasure.

942
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:38,805
Um... Are you sure you don't
want to come back with me?

943
00:47:38,805 --> 00:47:41,892
ÿÿÿAfter all, it is your
ÿÿÿapartment. It's fine.

944
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:45,395
After I made
it here, I...

945
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:48,565
...can't imagine
leaving myself, you know?

946
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:50,067
ÿOK, I know, I just...

947
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:53,320
It just feels weird
leaving you here alone.

948
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,706
ÿÿI don't know
ÿÿwhere else I belong.

949
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:59,209
Mr. Abbott. I'm sorry.

950
00:48:02,829 --> 00:48:04,831
ÿGoodbye, Elizabeth.

951
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:09,253
Goodbye.

952
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:18,929
Oh, I hate this.

953
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:20,931
She finally gets a life,
and then....

954
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:22,933
ÿÿYou know what?
ÿÿThat guy was cute.

955
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:25,936
ÿÿÿAt least she got a chance
ÿÿÿto hang with him for a while.

956
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:28,939
Yeah. It woulda been awful
if she'd gone through
her whole life

957
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:32,492
not knowing
what it was all about.

958
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:51,128
ÿÿ- [moaning]
ÿÿ- Oh, my God. Jenny?

959
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:54,214
No wonder
I could never find you.

960
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,023
I guess you got my job.

961
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:06,810
Yeah. I think I've
earned it. I deserve it.

962
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:08,612
Everything
you thought it would be?

963
00:49:08,895 --> 00:49:12,649
It is. And it's time to upgrade
from the 330 to the 740.

964
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:15,152
ÿ- Goin' to the dealer tonight.
ÿ- [phone rings]

965
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:17,654
Hold on. It's Walsh,
I have to take this.

966
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:19,122
ÿÿHello?

967
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:21,575
ÿReally? You want me to do it?

968
00:49:23,076 --> 00:49:24,578
ÿSure, of course I can.

969
00:49:29,583 --> 00:49:32,970
ÿÿDude, did you know I can get
ÿÿa built-in jack for my iPod?

970
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,339
Did you know there's
people out there dying?

971
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:36,807
ÿÿÿI'm in a coma,
ÿÿÿhave you noticed?

972
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,759
ÿÿI know. Sweet!

973
00:49:43,764 --> 00:49:46,266
ÿÿ[children laughing]

974
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:49,936
ÿÿÿZoe? Lily Vanilli?

975
00:49:49,936 --> 00:49:53,023
ÿÿOh, my God,
ÿÿyou guys got so big!

976
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,193
Beat ya!

977
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:57,694
ÿÿÿ- Did not!
ÿÿÿ- Did too!

978
00:49:58,278 --> 00:49:59,579
ÿÿÿ- Did not!
ÿÿÿ- Did too!

979
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,114
Did not!
Did too!

980
00:50:01,114 --> 00:50:03,033
ÿHow could I feel him
ÿand not you guys?

981
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:04,501
ÿÿÿ- Did not!
ÿÿÿ- Did too!

982
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,536
ÿÿ- Oh, that's funny.
ÿÿ- Abby.

983
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:09,339
ÿÿÿI remember saying
ÿÿÿno running, no screaming!

984
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:12,259
- Abby, can you feel me?
- All right, chill, I'm serious.

985
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,260
ÿÿI guess not.

986
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,713
ÿÿÿ- I hope you feel better.
ÿÿÿ- Get well soon.

987
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:18,048
ÿI love you.

988
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:20,384
I remember
when you pushed us...

989
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:22,386
It's so sweet you guys
come and visit me.

990
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:24,971
ÿ- And I really miss...
ÿ- Excuse me.

991
00:50:24,971 --> 00:50:27,057
ÿÿÿ- Mrs. Brody, hi.
ÿÿÿ- Hi.

992
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:29,559
Dr. Rushton. Could I
have a quick word?

993
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:32,562
ÿÿ- Sure.
ÿÿ- What do you want?

994
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:36,116
First of all, I hope you
know how much we all love
and miss Elizabeth.

995
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,902
ÿPlease. He's doing high fives
ÿhe's not in Phoenix.

996
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:41,204
And because she was
a senior resident here,

997
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,707
we've taken some fairly
extraordinary measures

998
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:47,244
to make her feel more
comfortable these last
three months.

999
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:49,629
ÿÿLily! Turn it back!

1000
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:50,997
ÿÿZoe, what did we talk about?

1001
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,550
ÿÿÿWatch your sister. Sorry.

1002
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,503
This is hard to say.

1003
00:50:56,503 --> 00:50:58,922
Um, when we come
to work here,

1004
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:01,341
we are asked
to sign release forms.

1005
00:51:01,341 --> 00:51:02,726
ÿOK.

1006
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,227
I don't like
the sound of this.

1007
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:09,316
Did you know your sister's
opinion about artificially
prolonging life?

1008
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,485
ÿ- No.
ÿ- She was against it.

1009
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:12,936
ÿReally?

1010
00:51:12,936 --> 00:51:14,938
ÿÿOK, that was before.
ÿÿI am completely for it now.

1011
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:18,442
Honestly, most in our
profession feel that way.

1012
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:21,278
ÿÿNot me!
ÿÿI'm perfectly happy.

1013
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:22,579
Come on, Abby!

1014
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,581
You have got to feel me,
I'm your sister!

1015
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:27,584
But there's still some
brain activity, isn't there?

1016
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,586
ÿPeople have woken up
ÿfrom this kind of coma.

1017
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,372
- All the time.
- Not on any record I've found.

1018
00:51:32,372 --> 00:51:36,176
Of course they have!
Otherwise, what am I doing here?

1019
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:38,628
- Ugh, I feel car sick.
- [kids laughing]

1020
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:41,465
ÿ- What are you doing?
ÿ- We're looking for the stick.

1021
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:42,432
ÿWhat stick?

1022
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:45,552
- You said she had a stick...
- Stop! Come on.

1023
00:51:45,552 --> 00:51:48,188
ÿTV is going to become
ÿa very dim memory for you two.

1024
00:51:48,722 --> 00:51:50,724
Mrs. Brody,
Elizabeth did sign a release.

1025
00:51:50,724 --> 00:51:52,726
But because
of the special situation,

1026
00:51:52,726 --> 00:51:56,313
ÿÿwe won't take any terminal
ÿÿaction without your explicit
ÿÿapproval.

1027
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:58,648
Now, I've prepared
this paperwork...

1028
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:00,150
Don't sign that.
I'm here!

1029
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,652
ÿ- ...if you decide to sign...
ÿ- I'll think about it.

1030
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:05,238
ÿÿÿAbby, I'll baby-sit more,
ÿÿÿI swear!

1031
00:52:05,238 --> 00:52:07,240
ÿÿÿAnd those jeans you love?
ÿÿÿThey're yours!

1032
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:09,543
ÿÿÿWe sometimes find
ÿÿÿthat it's easier

1033
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:12,913
just to ask God's forgiveness
and not prolong the inevitable.

1034
00:52:12,913 --> 00:52:14,714
ÿÿÿI said I'd think about it.

01:01:09,113 --> 01:01:11,449
This is my work.

1186
01:01:11,449 --> 01:01:14,836
I was a landscape architect.
I had my own company for awhile.

1187
01:01:16,838 --> 01:01:18,339
ÿDavid, I've been here before.

1188
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:20,341
ÿÿÿWhat do you mean?

1189
01:01:20,341 --> 01:01:22,677
ÿI know this is gonna
ÿsound really strange,

1190
01:01:22,677 --> 01:01:25,680
ÿÿbut I dreamed of this place.

1191
01:01:26,681 --> 01:01:30,185
ÿÿÿThese flowers, everything.

1192
01:01:30,685 --> 01:01:33,188
It's beautiful.

1193
01:01:33,188 --> 01:01:35,190
ÿÿÿI had no idea, David.

1194
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:38,193
What a joy it must be
to create a place like this.

1195
01:01:40,195 --> 01:01:41,696
Yeah, it was.

1196
01:01:41,946 --> 01:01:43,481
ÿÿÿIs it gonna be again?

1197
01:01:44,782 --> 01:01:46,117
Sure.

1198
01:01:46,117 --> 01:01:47,986
Promise?

1199
01:02:02,133 --> 01:02:04,052
[phone ringing]

1200
01:02:04,052 --> 01:02:07,255
Oh, wow.
Who the hell's calling me?

1201
01:02:07,255 --> 01:02:08,723
ÿHello?

1202
01:02:09,007 --> 01:02:10,258
ÿÿÿDavid, it's Grace.

1203
01:02:10,258 --> 01:02:13,645
ÿWell, you are the luckiest man
ÿin San Francisco.

1204
01:02:13,645 --> 01:02:16,264
Thank you.
Why do you say that?

1205
01:02:16,264 --> 01:02:18,066
Great news,
the apartment is yours.

1206
01:02:18,349 --> 01:02:20,602
And they're willing
to give you a nice long lease.

1207
01:02:20,602 --> 01:02:22,103
ÿÿÿHow long a lease?

1208
01:02:22,103 --> 01:02:24,188
ÿÿReally long.
ÿÿAnd I'm gonna send it over,

1209
01:02:24,689 --> 01:02:27,158
- and I'll talk to you tomorrow.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1210
01:02:27,158 --> 01:02:28,660
Why are they giving me
a long lease now?

1211
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:32,947
It's a terrible story.
The tenant was in
some kind of coma,

1212
01:02:32,947 --> 01:02:35,250
and it is what it is,
so they're gonna pull the plug.

1213
01:02:35,617 --> 01:02:39,504
ÿBut get this: they are gonna
ÿthrow in that couch you like.

1214
01:02:39,504 --> 01:02:42,040
-David?
- What?

1215
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,374
We gotta go talk to your sister.

1216
01:02:43,374 --> 01:02:45,627
ÿÿÿWhy? What are you
ÿÿÿgonna say to her?

1217
01:02:45,627 --> 01:02:47,128
What kind of dirt
do you have on her?

1218
01:02:47,629 --> 01:02:48,346
ÿ[? Kay Hanley:Lust For Life]

ÿ[Elizabeth] Her

01:02:50,431 --> 01:02:53,434
ÿIn the third grade she told
ÿeverybody it was Leia,
ÿlike Princess Leia.

1221
01:02:53,434 --> 01:02:55,219
ÿÿÿAll right. What else?

1222
01:02:55,219 --> 01:02:57,722
Um... She's
lactose intolerant?

1223
01:02:58,222 --> 01:03:00,224
ÿÿÿAll right, look, the only
ÿÿÿway this is gonna work

1224
01:03:00,224 --> 01:03:02,727
ÿÿÿis if I could tell her
ÿÿÿsomething that only you know.

1225
01:03:02,727 --> 01:03:04,562
ÿÿSomething so intimate,
ÿÿso personal...

Oh! Oh!

1227
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:09,117
She kissed her ex-boyfriend J.J.
five minutes before her wedding.

1228
01:03:09,117 --> 01:03:11,152
ÿÿÿOh, that'll work.
ÿÿÿThat's good.

1229
01:03:11,152 --> 01:03:14,739

ÿSo, how did you know Elizabeth?
ÿYou must've worked together.

1232
01:03:24,632 --> 01:03:26,134
ÿÿGod knows she
ÿÿwasn't dating anybody.

ÿÿEverybody likes
ÿÿto rub that one in.

Would you like some tea?

01:03:38,646 --> 01:03:40,148
ÿÿWell, yes, thank you, madam.

1239
01:03:40,148 --> 01:03:43,651
Abort. Don't do this in front of
them, it's gonna freak them out.

1240
01:03:43,985 --> 01:03:46,821
ÿÿI'm sorry, you were saying?
ÿÿHow did you know her?

1241
01:03:46,821 --> 01:03:48,823
ÿÿÿ- Lie. Lie your butt off.
ÿÿÿ- We worked together.

01:03:49,107 --> 01:03:50,325
ÿ- No!
ÿ- No.

1243
01:03:50,325 --> 01:03:53,411
No. You're not credible
as a doctor. Make something up.

1244
01:03:53,411 --> 01:03:56,948
ÿI mean, I didn't work
ÿwith her. We worked
ÿtogether on my illness.

1245
01:03:57,248 --> 01:03:58,416
I was a patient of hers.

1246
01:03:58,416 --> 01:04:00,668
ÿÿÿLily? Can you see me?

1247
01:04:00,668 --> 01:04:03,454
ÿ[David] I was sick.
ÿI had, uh, meningitis.

01:04:03,454 --> 01:04:05,373
ÿÿÿSpiral meningitis.

1249
01:04:05,373 --> 01:04:06,758
ÿÿÿOoh. I'm so sorry.

1250
01:04:06,758 --> 01:04:08,710
Spiral meningitis?
It's not even a disease.

1251
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:11,295
ÿÿOh, no, it's OK.
ÿÿI'm much better now.

1252
01:04:11,295 --> 01:04:12,296
I, uh...

1253
01:04:12,296 --> 01:04:14,298
Elizabeth, uh,
she believed in me,

1254
01:04:14,298 --> 01:04:18,219
ÿbelieved that I would recover
ÿwhen nobody else did.

1255
01:04:18,219 --> 01:04:19,554
And then I did.

1256
01:04:19,554 --> 01:04:21,556
ÿÿÿThat sounds just like her.

1257
01:04:21,556 --> 01:04:24,525
But why are you
telling me this?

1258
01:04:24,525 --> 01:04:29,397
ÿÿUh... Because I know
ÿÿabout Elizabeth's situation,

1259
01:04:29,397 --> 01:04:31,949
ÿÿand I just wanna say that...

1260
01:04:32,483 --> 01:04:33,951
ÿLily.

1261
01:04:33,951 --> 01:04:36,621
- ...there are things...
- You know I'm here, don't you?

1262
01:04:37,155 --> 01:04:38,156
ÿÿ[David] ...sometimes that...

1263
01:04:38,623 --> 01:04:40,992
ÿÿÿ...that are beyond
ÿÿÿour understanding.

1264
01:04:42,744 --> 01:04:45,630
And so, I just
wanted to ask you...

1265
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:48,633
Actually,
I just want to beg you

1266
01:04:49,133 --> 01:04:51,919
to, um... to give her
a little bit more time.

1267
01:04:51,919 --> 01:04:54,138
She's gonna pull
through this thing.

01:04:54,138 --> 01:04:55,840
I just know it.

1269

That's really
sweet of you to say,

ÿÿ- It's David, right?
ÿÿ- Mm-hmm.

1274
01:05:08,102 --> 01:05:12,023
ÿYou see, it's too late because
ÿI've already signed the papers.

1275
01:05:12,023 --> 01:05:14,525
ÿÿOh, Abby. I'm here.

1276
01:05:14,525 --> 01:05:16,411
Can you feel me?
I'm right here.

1277

ÿÿWe're terminating life support
ÿÿtomorrow at noon,

1278
01:05:19,614 --> 01:05:21,365
ÿwhile the girls
ÿare in school.

1279
01:05:21,365 --> 01:05:24,869
ÿÿÿI mean, the past three months
ÿÿÿhave been so hard on them,

1280
01:05:24,869 --> 01:05:26,621
ÿÿÿon this whole family.

1281
01:05:26,621 --> 01:05:28,423
Well, I understand that.
I really do.

1282
01:05:28,423 --> 01:05:30,925
But I think you're makin'
a grave mistake here,

1283
01:05:30,925 --> 01:05:34,178
ÿ- because I really believe...
ÿ- It's for the best. Really.

1284
01:05:34,178 --> 01:05:37,098
ÿÿÿThis is what
ÿÿÿElizabeth wanted.

1285
01:05:37,098 --> 01:05:40,685
ÿÿÿI mean, I spent my
ÿÿÿwhole life thinking
ÿÿÿI knew what was best for her.

1286
01:05:40,685 --> 01:05:44,605
ÿÿÿWhat she should wear,
ÿÿÿwhat men she should date.

1287
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:49,393
ÿÿThis is the last thing
ÿÿElizabeth asked for.

1288
01:05:49,894 --> 01:05:51,395
ÿÿAnd for the
ÿÿfirst time in my life,

1289
01:05:51,395 --> 01:05:54,398
ÿI'm gonna
ÿrespect her wishes.

1290
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:57,902
ÿÿÿOh, Abby.

1291
01:05:57,902 --> 01:06:00,371
Look.

1292
01:06:00,371 --> 01:06:02,373
This is gonna sound
really strange to you, but...

1293
01:06:02,373 --> 01:06:04,375
Oh, no.

1294
01:06:04,375 --> 01:06:06,828
...the truth is,
is that Elizabeth
is here with us right now.

1295
01:06:06,828 --> 01:06:11,165
She came here with me,
she's standing next to you,
begging you to wait.

1296
01:06:11,666 --> 01:06:13,384
ÿÿÿRight next to me?

1297
01:06:13,384 --> 01:06:15,470
ÿ- Right there.
ÿ- David, stop.

1298
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:17,588
No, let me do this.
I don't know how or why,

1299
01:06:17,588 --> 01:06:20,057
but somehow I can see
your sister's spirit.

1300
01:06:20,057 --> 01:06:23,060
I know it's crazy,
but I also can talk to her.

1301
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:26,564
So why don't I have her just
explain the whole thing to you,

1302
01:06:26,564 --> 01:06:28,015
and I'll translate.

1303
01:06:30,935 --> 01:06:33,437
ÿCould you just hold on,
ÿjust a sec?

1304
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:39,360
OK, tea party's over.
Time for Wiggly Safari!

1305
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:41,195
ÿÿ[both] Yeah!

1306
01:06:41,195 --> 01:06:44,832
ÿ- OK, David, this could work.
ÿ- I think I was
ÿgetting through to her.

1307
01:06:44,832 --> 01:06:48,419
- You need to get her
to the hospital.
- Right to the hospital.

1308
01:06:48,419 --> 01:06:53,007
- Get her to rip those papers...
- Get outta here, freak!

1309

ÿI'm not makin' this up!

1310
01:06:55,877 --> 01:06:57,628
Abby, calm down,
just calm down!

1311
01:06:57,628 --> 01:07:00,014
ÿÿÿI'll chop you!
ÿÿÿI swear, I will chop you!

1312
01:07:00,014 --> 01:07:01,849
ÿ- Tell her about J.J.
ÿ- I know about J.J.

1313
01:07:01,849 --> 01:07:04,602
- What?
- I know what you did with J.J.

1314
01:07:04,602 --> 01:07:07,188
I'll tell everybody.

1315
01:07:07,188 --> 01:07:09,190
How do you know that?
Nobody knows that!

1316
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:11,225
ÿÿÿGet outta here! Get going!

1317
01:07:18,115 --> 01:07:19,116
ÿÿYou kids OK?

1318
01:07:19,483 --> 01:07:23,871
ÿÿMommy, is Auntie Elizabeth
ÿÿgonna have more tea?

1319
01:07:25,873 --> 01:07:27,325
ÿWhat?

1320
01:07:39,887 --> 01:07:41,389
ÿWell, I don't
ÿthink your sister's

1321
01:07:41,889 --> 01:07:43,891
a very spiritual person.

1322
01:07:43,891 --> 01:07:45,343
She's just
bein' a good mom.

Tryin' to keep her kids
away from a crazy guy.

1324
01:07:52,516 --> 01:07:54,518
ÿÿÿI think I would have
ÿÿÿliked to have been a mom.

1325
01:07:54,518 --> 01:07:56,487
ÿYou'd make a good one.

ÿÿÿThis can't be it.

1329

- OK, I'm sorry.

1330
01:08:07,782 --> 01:08:10,084
ÿI know you don't
ÿlike to be called that.

1331
01:08:10,084 --> 01:08:11,452
I'm warming up to it.

1332
01:08:12,787 --> 01:08:14,288
ÿÿI can go to
ÿÿthat hospital.

1333
01:08:14,288 --> 01:08:16,207
I could talk to your friend,
Fran. I could...

1334
01:08:16,207 --> 01:08:18,843
ÿ- No, David.
ÿ- ...talk to the asshole guy.

1335
01:08:18,843 --> 01:08:22,346
Brett? No. Just stop,
they'll put you
in a straitjacket.

1336
01:08:22,346 --> 01:08:25,349
There's no way anyone's
gonna believe I'm still here.

1337
01:08:25,349 --> 01:08:27,551
ÿÿÿYour niece,
ÿÿÿthe little girl. She saw you.

1338
01:08:27,551 --> 01:08:29,053
Oh, great.

1339
01:08:29,053 --> 01:08:31,055
My fate's in the hands
of a four-year-old

1340
01:08:31,555 --> 01:08:34,275
who has seven other
imaginary friends.

1341
01:08:34,775 --> 01:08:36,611
ÿÿWait.
ÿÿThere is someone else.

1342
01:08:36,611 --> 01:08:38,062
What do you mean?

1343
01:08:38,062 --> 01:08:39,563
Come on.

1344
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:43,234
ÿÿÿ- [David] Darryl!
ÿÿÿ- Dude.

1345
01:08:43,234 --> 01:08:44,068
ÿ- Yeah.
ÿ- Whoa, whoa.

1346
01:08:44,568 --> 01:08:45,987
ÿThe spirit's
ÿwith you, isn't it?

1347
01:08:45,987 --> 01:08:48,456
ÿYou can't bring that thing
ÿin here. What are you thinking?

1348
01:08:48,789 --> 01:08:52,293
ÿ- You were right. She's alive.
ÿ- Righteous.

1349
01:08:52,293 --> 01:08:55,129
She's in a coma. Her family's
gonna take her off life support.

1350
01:08:55,129 --> 01:08:56,631
ÿÿÿNot so righteous.

1351
01:08:56,914 --> 01:09:00,384
ÿÿÿSo, what, are you
ÿÿÿguys socializing now?

1352
01:09:00,384 --> 01:09:03,337
We've... acclimated.

1353
01:09:03,337 --> 01:09:05,840
ÿÿÿYeah, I can tell.

1354
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:08,809
ÿÿÿIn fact, I'm sensin' some
ÿÿÿpretty intense feelings

1355
01:09:08,809 --> 01:09:10,311
ÿÿÿshe has for you, bro.

1356
01:09:10,311 --> 01:09:13,981
ÿ- Really?
ÿ- No, I don't.

1357
01:09:14,265 --> 01:09:17,068
ÿMajor red aura.
ÿSomebody's embarrassed.

1358
01:09:17,351 --> 01:09:20,271
ÿ- I am not. Can we focus here?
ÿ- OK.

1359
01:09:20,271 --> 01:09:23,524
- Ask him if there's a spell....
- Or a chant. Anything to get...

1360
01:09:23,524 --> 01:09:25,192
ÿ- My spirit...
ÿ- ...back in her body?

1361
01:09:25,192 --> 01:09:27,778
ÿWhoa. You're totally asking
ÿthe wrong question, man.

1362
01:09:27,778 --> 01:09:29,530
Why is that wrong?

1363
01:09:30,364 --> 01:09:32,366
ÿLook, I have the gift.

1364
01:09:32,366 --> 01:09:34,285
ÿÿI didn't ask for it,
ÿÿbut I do.

1365
01:09:34,285 --> 01:09:35,703
ÿÿÿI can sense these things,

1366
01:09:36,203 --> 01:09:37,705
ÿspirits, whatever
ÿyou wanna call 'em.

1367
01:09:38,205 --> 01:09:40,541
Why they're hangin' here
in the first place?

1368
01:09:40,541 --> 01:09:42,343
That's their
unfinished business.

1369
01:09:42,343 --> 01:09:43,794
So do I have the gift?

1370
01:09:44,128 --> 01:09:47,014
ÿÿÿDude, please.
ÿÿÿYou definitely don't have it.

1371
01:09:47,515 --> 01:09:48,799
ÿÿYou're a civilian.

1372
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:52,136
But if I don't have it,
how is it that I can see her

1373
01:09:52,136 --> 01:09:54,055
and talk to her
when no one else can?

1374
01:09:54,055 --> 01:09:56,941
- Exactly.
- Exactly what?

1375
01:09:56,941 --> 01:09:59,894
ÿÿThat's the right question.

1376
01:09:59,894 --> 01:10:02,279
What the hell
is he talking about?

1377
01:10:02,279 --> 01:10:04,315
God, I feel like it's
right there in front of us.

1378
01:10:04,782 --> 01:10:06,317
I just can't
get a handle on it.

1379
01:10:06,317 --> 01:10:09,820
ÿÿHow do you solve a problem
ÿÿthat isn't possible
ÿÿin the first place?

1380
01:10:10,321 --> 01:10:13,290
Because nothing seems
impossible to me anymore.

1381
01:10:13,290 --> 01:10:16,827
I mean, why did I move into your
apartment in the first place?

1382
01:10:16,827 --> 01:10:19,330
Why can I see you
when no one else can?

1383
01:10:19,330 --> 01:10:22,833
I mean, why was I down
in that restaurant
when that guy collapsed?

1384
01:10:22,833 --> 01:10:26,253
It all seems
interrelated somehow.

1385
01:10:26,253 --> 01:10:28,139
ÿ- What are you doing?
ÿ- I don't know.

1386
01:10:28,139 --> 01:10:30,891
I feel like I missed something
here. Wait a second.

1387
01:10:30,891 --> 01:10:33,894
ÿÿRosemary Preston lives
ÿÿright here in San Francisco.

1388
01:10:33,894 --> 01:10:35,312
We could go talk to her.

1389
01:10:35,312 --> 01:10:37,732
ÿÿI'll call Information,
ÿÿmaybe she's listed.

1390
01:10:37,732 --> 01:10:39,100
Where did you get this?

1391
01:10:41,318 --> 01:10:43,654
It was just
at the hospital.

1392
01:10:44,155 --> 01:10:46,657
ÿÿYeah. I, uh...

1393
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:49,660
ÿÿI took it.

1394
01:10:51,162 --> 01:10:52,580
ÿI'm sorry. I...

1395
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:53,497
ÿÿÿI just...

1396
01:10:53,998 --> 01:10:56,951
ÿÿÿI wanted to have
ÿÿÿa picture of you.

1397
01:10:57,501 --> 01:11:00,371
ÿÿÿI wasn't sure that I was
ÿÿÿgonna ever see you again.

1398
01:11:00,371 --> 01:11:02,706
ÿÿI'm sorry.

1399
01:11:02,706 --> 01:11:04,708
ÿÿNo, don't be sorry.

1400
01:11:07,711 --> 01:11:09,713
ÿÿThat's really nice.

1401
01:11:11,215 --> 01:11:13,217
ÿÿI really like that picture.

1402
01:11:14,218 --> 01:11:16,687
ÿYeah. Yeah,
ÿI liked it too.

1403
01:11:18,105 --> 01:11:20,608
I had just gotten
my MCAT scores back.

1404
01:11:20,608 --> 01:11:22,893
ÿÿWell,
ÿÿyou must've done well.

1405
01:11:22,893 --> 01:11:26,313
No, actually, I bombed.
My scores were so low

1406
01:11:26,313 --> 01:11:28,816
I couldn't even get
into correspondence school.

1407
01:11:28,816 --> 01:11:31,569
ÿÿÿ- And that's a good thing?
ÿÿÿ- No.

1408
01:11:31,569 --> 01:11:34,872
I know it sounds kinda crazy. I
wanted to go back to the library

1409
01:11:34,872 --> 01:11:37,208
and start studying immediately,
but Abby said no.

1410
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:40,077
The only thing to do
was to burn my scores

1411
01:11:40,077 --> 01:11:42,880
ÿand drink margaritas.

1412
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,882
ÿÿLots and lots of margaritas.

1413
01:11:44,882 --> 01:11:46,967
ÿÿÿ[David] Well,
ÿÿÿlooks like she was right.

1414
01:11:46,967 --> 01:11:50,171
[chuckles] It's just funny
because the one time

1415
01:11:50,171 --> 01:11:53,174
I completely failed
at something,

1416
01:11:53,174 --> 01:11:55,593
I had more fun
than I'd ever had in my life.

1417
01:11:57,478 --> 01:11:58,979
ÿYou look happy.

1418
01:12:01,482 --> 01:12:04,268
I was happy.

1419
01:12:04,268 --> 01:12:07,071
But what was I doing
with the rest of my time?

1420
01:12:07,071 --> 01:12:09,690
When I think about my life
and I...

1421
01:12:11,025 --> 01:12:13,027
ÿAll I can remember is working.

1422
01:12:14,028 --> 01:12:16,030
ÿYou know? Working and working

1423
01:12:16,530 --> 01:12:19,366
ÿÿand trying so hard.

1424
01:12:19,366 --> 01:12:21,168
And for what?

1425
01:12:21,168 --> 01:12:23,170
You help people.

1426
01:12:24,171 --> 01:12:25,673
You save lives.

1427
01:12:25,673 --> 01:12:28,375
Yeah. Including my own.

1428
01:12:28,375 --> 01:12:31,378
I saved my life, for later.

1429
01:12:33,881 --> 01:12:35,883
I just...

1430
01:12:35,883 --> 01:12:38,352
I never thought
there wouldn't be a later.

1431
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:41,105
ÿÿNo, don't say that.
ÿÿThere's still time.

1432
01:12:41,105 --> 01:12:42,890
ÿÿWe're gonna see this lady...

1433
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:46,810
ÿYou know, I just don't want
ÿto spend my last night crying.

1434
01:12:46,810 --> 01:12:49,813
Or... fighting my fate.

1435
01:12:51,065 --> 01:12:53,367
I wanna do
something with you.

1436
01:12:55,870 --> 01:12:58,622
ÿÿOK. OK, great.

1437
01:12:59,123 --> 01:13:00,124
ÿWhat do you want to do?

1438
01:13:00,124 --> 01:13:01,625
ÿÿÿYou want to fly to Paris?

1439
01:13:01,625 --> 01:13:03,627
ÿÿÿSee the Eiffel Tower?
ÿÿÿNo problem.

1440
01:13:03,627 --> 01:13:06,630
ÿYou wanna dance on a beach
ÿin Bali? Let's go! Let's do it!

1441
01:13:07,081 --> 01:13:07,998
ÿÿÿAnywhere in the world

1442
01:13:08,299 --> 01:13:11,252
ÿthat will take
ÿMasterCard or Visa.

1443
01:13:11,252 --> 01:13:12,753
ÿÿÿAnywhere.

1444
01:13:14,755 --> 01:13:17,258
There is something
that I would like to do.

1445
01:13:18,642 --> 01:13:20,094
ÿÿÿAnything.

1446
01:13:22,012 --> 01:13:23,514
ÿÿI'm so bad at this.

1447
01:13:24,014 --> 01:13:26,016
ÿÿÿWhat? What is it?

1448
01:13:35,492 --> 01:13:36,994
Are you nervous?

1449
01:13:38,495 --> 01:13:40,998
ÿÿ- A little.
ÿÿ- Why?

1450
01:13:40,998 --> 01:13:44,001
ÿÿÿI don't know.

1451
01:13:44,001 --> 01:13:48,005
How can you be nervous
when I can't even touch you?

1452
01:13:48,005 --> 01:13:52,009
ÿI think I'm more nervous
ÿbecause you can't touch me.

1453
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:54,511
Why?

1454
01:13:56,013 --> 01:13:59,516
ÿÿÿYou know in the hospital
ÿÿÿwhen you touched my hand?

1455
01:14:00,301 --> 01:14:02,136
ÿÿI felt it.

1456
01:14:02,136 --> 01:14:05,556
ÿÿI mean,
ÿÿmy spirit felt it.

1457
01:14:05,556 --> 01:14:08,025
ÿÿÿI don't know how.

1458
01:14:09,059 --> 01:14:12,646
But I think if you could
ever really touch me...

1459
01:14:14,148 --> 01:14:16,984
ÿÿ...I might wake up
ÿÿfrom all of this.

1460
01:14:34,885 --> 01:14:36,887
I can almost feel that.

1461
01:14:37,388 --> 01:14:38,889
ÿMe too.

1462
01:14:40,307 --> 01:14:43,093
ÿÿI think I know what
ÿÿmy unfinished business is.

1463
01:14:43,093 --> 01:14:44,428
What?

1464
01:14:46,397 --> 01:14:47,898
You.

1465
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:14,591
ÿÿÿElizabeth.

1466
01:15:16,093 --> 01:15:17,594
ÿÿÿElizabeth?

1467
01:15:17,594 --> 01:15:20,097
ÿÿÿ- Elizabeth?!
ÿÿÿ- I'm right here.

1468
01:15:20,097 --> 01:15:22,766
Oh, good, good.
I thought you were gone.

1469
01:15:22,766 --> 01:15:24,718
Suddenly I know
what I'm supposed to do,

1470
01:15:24,718 --> 01:15:26,687
ÿÿbecause this time
ÿÿI can do something.

1471
01:15:26,687 --> 01:15:28,472
ÿÿWhat are you talking about?

1472
01:15:28,472 --> 01:15:31,859
Lizzie, when we first met, I
kept saying that you were dead.

1473
01:15:31,859 --> 01:15:34,862
ÿÿBut it was me that was dead,
ÿÿand you brought me back.

1474
01:15:34,862 --> 01:15:36,864
ÿYou saved me.

1475
01:15:37,364 --> 01:15:39,199
ÿÿAnd now it's my turn
ÿÿto save you.

1476
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:40,534
ÿÿHow?

1477
01:15:40,901 --> 01:15:43,037
ÿÿÿI'm gonna steal your body.

David. David, what are you
thinking? You can't do this!

1480
01:15:50,127 --> 01:15:52,579
ÿÿ- Why can't I?
ÿÿ- Because you'll go to jail.

1481
01:15:52,579 --> 01:15:55,966
So? If something happens to you,
you think I care where I'll be?

1482
01:15:55,966 --> 01:15:59,887
At least this'll buy us
a little more time.

1483
01:15:59,887 --> 01:16:02,756
The things you'd have to know to
even start to pull this off...

1484
01:16:02,756 --> 01:16:05,642
You know them.
You'll talk me through it.

1485
01:16:06,927 --> 01:16:08,929
ÿÿÿOK, you're
ÿÿÿgonna need a van.

1486
01:16:08,929 --> 01:16:12,316
ÿAnd somebody
ÿwith no morals.

ÿÿ- What are we movin' again?
ÿÿ- Medical supplies.

01:16:22,493 --> 01:16:24,695
ÿ- You didn't tell him?
ÿYou have to.
ÿ- Shh.

1491
01:16:24,695 --> 01:16:26,663
You know, David,
he looks familiar to me.

1492
01:16:26,663 --> 01:16:28,749
ÿÿÿ- You saw him at the bar.
ÿÿÿ- Saw who at the bar?

1493
01:16:28,749 --> 01:16:30,701
ÿNo one, never mind.

OK, and we're in such a hurry

1496
01:16:36,924 --> 01:16:40,377
ÿÿThere's a one-day sale
ÿÿon hospital beds.
ÿÿI always wanted one.

Oh, great. Now you're
gonna become a bed potato.

01:16:45,549 --> 01:16:47,468
ÿ- Not yet what?
ÿ- We're not there yet.

1500
01:16:47,468 --> 01:16:49,386
OK, Dave,
be honest with me.

1501
01:16:49,386 --> 01:16:51,889
Has your imaginary friend
come out to play, huh?

1502
01:16:51,889 --> 01:16:53,891
ÿÿÿ- Oops.
ÿÿÿ- Oh, God!

1503
01:16:53,891 --> 01:16:55,225
Whoa!

1504
01:16:55,225 --> 01:16:58,779
ÿ? I've got a bad case
ÿof lovin' you ??

1505
01:16:59,563 --> 01:17:01,565
OK, grab a cart.

1506
01:17:01,565 --> 01:17:04,118
You need
a blood pressure cuff

1507
01:17:04,618 --> 01:17:07,621
ÿand a portable ventilator,
ÿright there, that yellow thing.

1508
01:17:08,205 --> 01:17:10,574
Dave, what the hell are you
doing? This isn't a sale, man!

1509
01:17:10,574 --> 01:17:12,075
ÿÿAll right. OK.

1510
01:17:12,075 --> 01:17:13,877
I knew you wouldn't come
if I told you.

1511
01:17:13,877 --> 01:17:16,330
ÿ- Do I really wanna hear this?
ÿ- My imaginary friend

1512
01:17:16,330 --> 01:17:17,748
ÿÿÿis not imaginary.

1513
01:17:17,748 --> 01:17:20,167
She is the spirit
of a girl in a coma upstairs

1514
01:17:20,584 --> 01:17:22,920
ÿÿÿwho they're about
ÿÿÿto take off life support.

1515
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,388
We've got to get
her body someplace safe.

1516
01:17:24,838 --> 01:17:26,423
ÿÿÿ- Really?
ÿÿÿ- Really.

1517
01:17:26,423 --> 01:17:28,809
- You should've told him.
- He wouldn't have believed me.

1518
01:17:28,809 --> 01:17:31,812
ÿÿÿ- Does he believe you now?
ÿÿÿ- I had to get him
ÿÿÿinto the hospital!

1519
01:17:31,812 --> 01:17:33,313
ÿÿÿLet me take you
ÿÿÿto the psych ward.

1520
01:17:33,313 --> 01:17:35,599
ÿÿÿThere are people up there
ÿÿÿwho can help you!

1521
01:17:36,016 --> 01:17:37,901
ÿÿÿNo time.
ÿÿÿIt's 11:30 right now.

1522
01:17:37,901 --> 01:17:39,903
ÿShe's gonna be dead
ÿin half an hour!

1523
01:17:39,903 --> 01:17:41,905
ÿÿÿTell him I know
ÿÿÿthis is a stretch.

1524
01:17:41,905 --> 01:17:43,824
ÿElizabeth is standing
ÿright behind you right now.

1525
01:17:43,824 --> 01:17:46,326
ÿÿShe says she knows what
ÿÿa stretch this is for you.

1526
01:17:46,326 --> 01:17:47,828
ÿÿ- Oh, does she? OK.
ÿÿ- Yes.

1527
01:17:47,828 --> 01:17:49,830
Well, if your friend's
really behind me,

1528
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:51,999
ask her what I'm doing:
rock, paper or scissors?

1529
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:54,084
- Rock.
- Rock.

1530
01:17:54,535 --> 01:17:56,003
ÿÿ- Scissors.
ÿÿ- Scissors.

1531
01:17:56,753 --> 01:17:58,622
- Paper.
- Paper.

1532
01:17:58,622 --> 01:18:00,507
ÿ- Rock again.
ÿ- Rock again.

1533
01:18:00,791 --> 01:18:03,210
ÿÿ- He's flipping me off.
ÿÿ- Are you flipping her off?

1534
01:18:03,210 --> 01:18:06,346
ÿÿÿ- You're flipping her off!
ÿÿÿ- How...?

1535
01:18:06,346 --> 01:18:08,882
OK. OK, sometimes
people with emotional

1536
01:18:08,882 --> 01:18:11,935
and mental disturbances
can have psychic moments.

1537
01:18:11,935 --> 01:18:13,470
But even if she was real,

1538
01:18:13,470 --> 01:18:15,889
do you know what you're
risking for this woman?

1539
01:18:15,889 --> 01:18:17,357
ÿ- Yes!
ÿ- Why?

1540
01:18:19,276 --> 01:18:20,644
ÿBecause I love her.

1541
01:18:21,612 --> 01:18:23,146
ÿI love her.

1542
01:18:23,146 --> 01:18:25,199
ÿÿÿI do, I love you.

1543
01:18:26,617 --> 01:18:28,986
No one's ever
said that to me before.

1544
01:18:35,542 --> 01:18:37,044
- David?
- What?

1545
01:18:37,044 --> 01:18:40,047
- Tell him thank you.
- We're really grateful, Jack.

1546
01:18:40,047 --> 01:18:41,048
I'm not
doin' it for you.

1547
01:18:41,048 --> 01:18:42,833
ÿÿÿThen why are you doing it?

1548
01:18:42,833 --> 01:18:46,136
Because someday, trust me, I'm
gonna need help movin' a body.

1549
01:18:46,136 --> 01:18:49,139
When that day comes, I don't
wanna hear any shit from you.

1550
01:18:52,342 --> 01:18:54,645
OK, get me on the gurney, quick.

1551
01:18:54,645 --> 01:18:55,929
[Jack] Oh, my God. David.

1552
01:18:55,929 --> 01:18:57,431
[David] I know.
She's pretty, right?

1553
01:18:57,431 --> 01:18:59,149
ÿÿThat's really sweet,
ÿÿbut we've gotta go.

1554
01:18:59,650 --> 01:19:01,652
No, that's not it.
This is her.

1555
01:19:01,652 --> 01:19:06,156
This is the woman
I set you up with, the woman
you stood up that night!

1556
01:19:06,156 --> 01:19:07,658
ÿI was gonna
ÿmeet Elizabeth?

1557
01:19:07,658 --> 01:19:11,028
And she didn't make it either,
because she had an accident.

1558
01:19:12,112 --> 01:19:13,497
ÿÿIt was you.

1559
01:19:13,497 --> 01:19:14,865
Is that it?
Is that why?

1560
01:19:14,865 --> 01:19:16,783
ÿÿI was supposed to meet you.

1561
01:19:17,751 --> 01:19:19,086
ÿÿÿHow did you know her?

1562
01:19:19,086 --> 01:19:21,455
I'm friends with her sister.
We went out years ago.

1563
01:19:21,455 --> 01:19:23,957
ÿÿI knew I'd seen him before.
ÿÿThat's J.J.!

1564
01:19:23,957 --> 01:19:25,959
- Jack is J.J.?
- Yeah.

1565
01:19:25,959 --> 01:19:28,962
What did you...? No one's
called me J.J. since college.

1566
01:19:28,962 --> 01:19:30,964
He's older and hairier,
but it's him.

1567
01:19:30,964 --> 01:19:33,350
He's the one who tongued
Abby at the wedding?

1568
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:34,718
How the hell did you know?
Nobody knows.

1569
01:19:35,135 --> 01:19:36,720
ÿÿÿ- It's Elizabeth.
ÿÿÿ- Oh, my God.

1570
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:39,773
ÿ- She really is here.
ÿ- I told you!

1571
01:19:39,773 --> 01:19:41,191
Well, let's get her
on the gurney!

1572
01:19:41,191 --> 01:19:43,560
I don't want them killing
Abby's sister! Come on.

ÿÿÿBuy some time.

ÿDr. Walsh sent me down

I had no verbal or written
