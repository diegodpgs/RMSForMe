1
00:00:13,518 --> 00:00:16,078
"I'll miss you, Chihiro.
Your best friend, Rumi."

2
00:00:16,158 --> 00:00:21,232
Chihiro.
Chihiro, we're almost there.

3
00:00:23,078 --> 00:00:25,750
This really is
in the middle of nowhere.

4
00:00:25,838 --> 00:00:28,556
I'm gonna have to go
to the next town to shop.

5
00:00:28,637 --> 00:00:30,867
We'll just have to
learn to like it.

6
00:00:33,077 --> 00:00:36,910
Look, Chihiro. There's your new school.
Looks great, doesn't it?

7
00:00:37,877 --> 00:00:40,515
It doesn't look so bad.

8
00:00:47,195 --> 00:00:51,792
It's gonna stink.
I liked my old school.

9
00:00:54,035 --> 00:00:56,913
Mom!
My flowers are dying!

10
00:00:56,995 --> 00:00:59,668
I told you not to smother them
like that.

11
00:00:59,755 --> 00:01:03,714
We'll put them in water
when we get to our new home.

12
00:01:03,794 --> 00:01:07,503
I fiinally get a bouquet, and it's
a goodbye present. That's depressing.

13
00:01:07,594 --> 00:01:10,950
Daddy bought you a rose for your
birthday. Don't you remember?

14
00:01:11,034 --> 00:01:14,265
Yeah, one.
Just one rose isn't a bouquet.

15
00:01:14,354 --> 00:01:16,822
Hold on to your card.
I'm opening the window.

16
00:01:16,913 --> 00:01:20,622
And quit whining.
It's fun to move to a new place.

17
00:01:57,031 --> 00:02:00,705
Wait.
Did I take the wrong turn?

18
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:03,149
This can't be right.

19
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,664
- Look, there's our house.
- Huh?

20
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,138
It's that blue one on the end.

21
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:11,984
Oh, you're right.
I must have missed the turn-off.

22
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:14,503
This road should get us there.

23
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,899
Honey, don't take a short cut.
You always get us lost.

24
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:19,945
Trust me. It's gonna work.

25
00:02:20,028 --> 00:02:22,099
What are those stones?
They look like little houses.

26
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:25,340
They're shrines. Some people think
little spirits live there.

27
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:35,702
- Dad, I think we're lost.
- We're fiine. I've got four-wheel drive.

28
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,107
Sit down, please, sweetie.

29
00:02:57,426 --> 00:02:59,576
Slow down!
You're gonna kill us.

30
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,659
What's that?

31
00:03:17,025 --> 00:03:21,496
- What's this old building?
- It looks like an entrance.

32
00:03:21,585 --> 00:03:25,133
Honey, get back in the car.
We're going to be late.

33
00:03:25,225 --> 00:03:27,056
Chihiro.

34
00:03:27,144 --> 00:03:29,055
Oh, for heaven's sake.

35
00:03:29,144 --> 00:03:31,817
This building's not old. It's fake.

36
00:03:31,904 --> 00:03:35,100
These stones are just made of plaster.

37
00:03:44,263 --> 00:03:47,255
- The wind's pulling us in.
- What is it?

38
00:03:47,343 --> 00:03:49,537
Come on. Let's go in.
I want to see what's on the other side.

39
00:03:49,623 --> 00:03:52,295
I'm not going.
It gives me the creeps.

40
00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:56,819
Don't be such a scaredy-cat, Chihiro.
Let's just take a look.

41
00:03:56,902 --> 00:03:59,052
The movers will get to our house
before we do.

42
00:03:59,142 --> 00:04:02,770
It's all right. They've got the keys.
They can start without us.

43
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:06,456
- All right. Just a quick look.
- Forget it. I'm not going.

44
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:10,530
Come on, you guys.
Let's get out of here.

45
00:04:10,621 --> 00:04:13,976
- Come on, honey. It'll be fun.
- I'm not going!

46
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,892
Chihiro, just wait in the car then.

47
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,571
But, Mom!

48
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,008
Wait for me!

49
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,296
Everybody watch your step.

50
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,451
Chihiro, don't cling like that.
You'll make me trip.

51
00:05:14,456 --> 00:05:18,005
- What is this place?
- Oh, do you hear that?

52
00:05:26,216 --> 00:05:29,685
- It sounds like a train.
- We must be near a train station.

53
00:05:29,776 --> 00:05:32,084
Come on.
Let's go check it out.

54
00:06:08,213 --> 00:06:12,171
- What are those weird buildings?
- I knew it.

55
00:06:12,253 --> 00:06:15,961
It's an abandoned theme park. See?

56
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:19,646
They built them everywhere
in the early '90s.

57
00:06:19,732 --> 00:06:23,611
Then the economy went bad,
and they all went bankrupt.

58
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:25,602
This must be one of them.

59
00:06:25,691 --> 00:06:28,649
Where are you going?
You said just a quick look.

60
00:06:28,732 --> 00:06:31,370
Now let's go back.

61
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:35,722
Hey!

62
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,927
Did you hear that building?
It was moaning.

63
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,525
It's just the wind.
Oh, what a beautiful place.

64
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,169
We should have brought our lunch.
Then we could have had a picnic.

65
00:06:56,929 --> 00:06:59,204
Look. They were planning
to put a river here.

66
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:06,923
Hey, you smell that?

67
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:09,920
- Something smells delicious.
- Yeah, and I'm starving.

68
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:13,239
Maybe this theme park's
still in business. Let's go.

69
00:07:13,328 --> 00:07:16,957
- Chihiro, hurry it up.
- Wait a minute.

70
00:07:50,205 --> 00:07:51,924
This way.

71
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:59,161
How strange.
They're all restaurants.

72
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,440
Where is everybody?

73
00:08:02,685 --> 00:08:05,562
Ah, there it is.

74
00:08:09,644 --> 00:08:12,602
Hey, I found it!

75
00:08:22,843 --> 00:08:24,674
Hey, you gotta see this. In here.

76
00:08:27,043 --> 00:08:29,432
Ah, look at this.

77
00:08:29,523 --> 00:08:32,434
Hello in there!
Does anybody work here?

78
00:08:32,523 --> 00:08:35,275
Come in, Chihiro. It looks delicious.

79
00:08:35,362 --> 00:08:37,353
Anybody?

80
00:08:41,122 --> 00:08:44,557
Don't worry, honey.
We can pay the bill when they get back.

81
00:08:44,642 --> 00:08:47,314
Good plan.
Hey, that looks great.

82
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,869
I wonder what this is called.

83
00:08:51,121 --> 00:08:54,271
Oh, it's delicious.
Chihiro, you have to taste this.

84
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:58,911
I don't want any. We're gonna get
in trouble. Let's just get out of here.

85
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,072
Don't worry.
You've got Daddy here.

86
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,629
He's got credit cards and cash.

87
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,912
Chihiro, you have to try this.
It's so tender.

88
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:14,990
- Mustard?
- Thank you.

89
00:09:25,478 --> 00:09:29,074
Come on, you guys.
You can't.

90
00:10:37,394 --> 00:10:39,304
That's weird.

91
00:11:09,111 --> 00:11:11,784
There's the train.

92
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,301
You shouldn't be here.
Get out of here now!

93
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,301
- What?
- It's almost night.

94
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,301
Leave, before it gets dark.

95
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:32,224
They're lighting the lamps.
Get out of here.

96
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:35,858
You've gotta get across the river.
Go! I'll distract them.

97
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:51,382
What's up with him?

98
00:11:58,948 --> 00:12:00,858
Mom! Dad!

99
00:12:00,948 --> 00:12:05,384
Come on! Quit eating!
Let's get out of here!

100
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:36,258
Mom! Dad!
Where are you?

101
00:12:44,704 --> 00:12:46,296
Mommy!

102
00:13:08,303 --> 00:13:10,099
Water?

103
00:13:23,222 --> 00:13:26,896
What?
I'm dreaming! I'm dreaming!

104
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:31,175
Come on.
Wake up! Wake up!

105
00:13:32,261 --> 00:13:34,933
Wake up.

106
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,094
It's just a dream.
It's just a dream. Go away.

107
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,172
Away. Disappear.

108
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,650
I'm see-through!

109
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:01,370
It's just a bad dream.

110
00:14:54,255 --> 00:14:56,644
Don't be afraid.
I just want to help you.

111
00:14:56,735 --> 00:14:58,804
No! No! No!

112
00:14:58,895 --> 00:15:00,965
Open your mouth and eat this.

113
00:15:01,055 --> 00:15:04,763
- You have to eat some food from
this world, or else you'll disappear.
- No!

114
00:15:09,454 --> 00:15:12,605
Don't worry.
It won't turn you into a pig.

115
00:15:12,694 --> 00:15:14,730
Chew it and swallow.

116
00:15:24,693 --> 00:15:26,923
There you go.
You're all better.

117
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:29,083
See for yourself.

118
00:15:36,692 --> 00:15:39,252
- I'm okay.
- You see?

119
00:15:39,332 --> 00:15:42,005
- Now, come with me.
- Where are my mom and dad?

120
00:15:42,091 --> 00:15:44,366
They didn't really
turn into pigs, did they?

121
00:15:44,452 --> 00:15:47,124
You can't see them now,
but you will.

122
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,406
Don't move.

123
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:13,768
That bird's looking for you.
You've gotta get out of here.

124
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:16,488
Ah! My legs!
I can't stand up.

125
00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:18,241
Help! What do I do?

126
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:21,480
Calm down.
Take a deep breath.

127
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:28,480
In the name of the wind
and water within thee, unbind her.

128
00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:30,365
Get up.

129
00:17:11,325 --> 00:17:15,364
You have to hold your breath
while we cross the bridge.

130
00:17:15,445 --> 00:17:21,394
Even the tiniest breath will break the
spell, and then everyone will see you.

131
00:17:25,764 --> 00:17:27,755
I'm scared.

132
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:29,755
Now, just stay calm.

133
00:17:29,845 --> 00:17:32,756
Welcome. Welcome.
Always nice to see you.

134
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,278
Welcome back.
Welcome. Welcome.

135
00:17:35,364 --> 00:17:37,752
- I'm back from my mission.
- Ah, welcome.

136
00:17:37,843 --> 00:17:39,754
Welcome back, Master Haku.

137
00:17:39,843 --> 00:17:42,721
Take a deep breath.

138
00:17:42,803 --> 00:17:44,873
Hold it.

139
00:18:00,642 --> 00:18:04,680
- Welcome. Welcome.
- It's good to see you.

140
00:18:05,801 --> 00:18:07,757
Hang on. Almost there.

141
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:12,640
Master Haku!
Where have you been?

142
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:15,831
Wha... A human?

143
00:18:15,921 --> 00:18:17,990
Let's go!

144
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,318
Master Haku!
Master Haku!

145
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:42,075
Here. Hurry. Boy, boy, boy,
it stinks up the place.

146
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:44,957
- They know you're here.
- I'm sorry. I took a breath.

147
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:47,030
No, Chihiro, you did very well.

148
00:18:47,118 --> 00:18:49,916
Listen carefully
to what I tell you to do.

149
00:18:49,998 --> 00:18:51,556
You can't stay here.
They'll fiind you...

150
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:53,629
and you'll never get
to rescue your parents.

151
00:18:53,718 --> 00:18:55,709
I'll create a diversion
while you escape.

152
00:18:55,798 --> 00:18:58,028
No! Don't leave me.
I don't wanna be alone.

153
00:18:58,118 --> 00:19:01,554
You don't have any choice
if you want to help your parents.

154
00:19:01,637 --> 00:19:03,548
This is what you have to do.

155
00:19:03,637 --> 00:19:07,425
They did turn into pigs.
I wasn't dreaming.

156
00:19:07,517 --> 00:19:09,428
Don't worry.

157
00:19:09,517 --> 00:19:14,192
Now, when things quiet down,
go out through the back gate.

158
00:19:14,277 --> 00:19:17,188
Go all the way down the stairs
until you reach the boiler room...

159
00:19:17,277 --> 00:19:19,551
where they stoke the fiires.

160
00:19:19,636 --> 00:19:24,231
There you'll fiind Kamajii,
the boiler man.

161
00:19:24,316 --> 00:19:26,193
Kamajii?

162
00:19:26,276 --> 00:19:30,315
Tell him you want to work here.
Even if he refuses, you must insist.

163
00:19:30,396 --> 00:19:34,308
If you don't get a job,
Yubaba will turn you into an animal.

164
00:19:34,395 --> 00:19:36,306
Yubaba. Huh?

165
00:19:36,395 --> 00:19:38,783
You'll see.
She's the witch who rules the bathhouse.

166
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:42,424
Kamajii will try to turn you away
or trick you into leaving...

167
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,824
but just keep asking for work.

168
00:19:44,915 --> 00:19:47,508
It'll be hard work,
but you'll be able to stay here.

169
00:19:47,594 --> 00:19:50,062
- Then even Yubaba can't harm you.
- Mm-hmm.

170
00:19:50,154 --> 00:19:53,065
- Master Haku?
- Master Haku, where are you?

171
00:19:53,154 --> 00:19:56,987
I have to go. And don't forget,
Chihiro, I'm your friend.

172
00:19:57,074 --> 00:19:58,825
How did you know
my name's Chihiro?

173
00:19:58,913 --> 00:20:01,302
I've known you since you were
very small. Good luck.

174
00:20:01,393 --> 00:20:04,305
And whatever you do,
don't make a sound.

175
00:20:04,393 --> 00:20:06,304
Master Haku.

176
00:20:06,393 --> 00:20:08,384
Calm down. I'm coming.

177
00:20:10,193 --> 00:20:12,582
Master Haku,
Yubaba wants to see you.

178
00:20:12,672 --> 00:20:16,711
I know.
It's about my mission, right?

179
00:24:23,934 --> 00:24:27,688
Uh, hello? Excuse me.

180
00:24:34,734 --> 00:24:37,406
Uh, hello?

181
00:24:42,933 --> 00:24:45,208
Uh, hello.
Are you Kamajii?

182
00:24:45,293 --> 00:24:47,761
Eh?

183
00:24:52,853 --> 00:24:56,527
Haku told me to come here
and ask you for work.
Could you give me a job, please?

184
00:25:02,132 --> 00:25:04,884
Four bath tokens at once.

185
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:07,326
Come on.
Get to work, you little runts.

186
00:25:08,811 --> 00:25:13,805
Yeah, I'm Kamajii, slave to the
boiler that heats the baths.

187
00:25:13,891 --> 00:25:16,644
Move it, ya stupid soot balls.

188
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:19,325
Please, I've gotta get a job here.

189
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,322
I don't need any help.

190
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:24,368
The place is full of soot.
I just cast a spell on them...

191
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:26,725
and I've got all
the workers I need.

192
00:25:41,209 --> 00:25:43,598
Oh. Sorry.

193
00:25:46,528 --> 00:25:48,917
Wait. Just a second.

194
00:26:00,688 --> 00:26:02,917
Out of the way.

195
00:26:55,444 --> 00:26:57,877
What should I do with this?

196
00:27:04,243 --> 00:27:08,474
- Should I leave it here?
- Finish what you started, human.

197
00:28:08,118 --> 00:28:12,270
Hey, you runts.
You wanna turn back into soot?

198
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:15,907
And you, back off.
You can't just take someone else's job.

199
00:28:15,998 --> 00:28:19,388
If they don't work, the spell wears off.
They turn back into soot.

200
00:28:19,477 --> 00:28:23,789
There's no work for you here, got it?
Try somewhere else.

201
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:35,868
You soot balls got a problem?
Now, get back to work!

202
00:28:36,956 --> 00:28:39,676
Chow time. What's going on?

203
00:28:39,756 --> 00:28:41,986
Are you guys fiighting again?

204
00:28:43,076 --> 00:28:46,785
Where's your other bowl?
From yesterday?

205
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:49,595
I keep telling you
to leave it out, Kamajii.

206
00:28:49,675 --> 00:28:51,745
Meal time!
Take a break.

207
00:29:07,154 --> 00:29:12,353
A human! You're in trouble.
You're the one everyone's looking for.

208
00:29:13,114 --> 00:29:15,548
- She's my granddaughter.
- Granddaughter?

209
00:29:17,114 --> 00:29:20,992
She said she wants to work here,
but I've got all the help I need.

210
00:29:21,073 --> 00:29:24,588
Will you take her to see Yubaba?
She's a tough little girl.

211
00:29:24,673 --> 00:29:26,584
I think she can handle it.

212
00:29:26,672 --> 00:29:29,312
No way.
I'm not gonna risk my life.

213
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:33,021
What if I give you
this roasted newt? Hmm?

214
00:29:33,112 --> 00:29:35,865
Mm, it's a good one.

215
00:29:35,953 --> 00:29:39,991
If you want a job,
you'll have to make a deal with Yubaba.

216
00:29:40,072 --> 00:29:42,461
She's the head honcho here.

217
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:46,463
Give me that! Come on, little girl.
You better follow me.

218
00:29:52,511 --> 00:29:56,503
- Can't you even manage
a-a "yes, ma'am" or a "thank you"?
- Yes, ma'am.

219
00:29:56,591 --> 00:29:58,502
What a dope. Hurry up.

220
00:29:58,591 --> 00:30:00,820
Yes, ma'am.

221
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,980
Uh, you don't need your shoes
or your socks.

222
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,708
- Just leave 'em.
- Yes, ma'am.

223
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,226
Thank the boiler man,
you idiot.

224
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,778
You know he's really
sticking his neck out for you.

225
00:30:15,869 --> 00:30:19,987
Ow! Thank you,
Mr Boiler Man.

226
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:22,822
Good luck.

227
00:30:32,188 --> 00:30:33,906
We have to go all the way
to the top floor.

228
00:30:33,988 --> 00:30:36,297
That's where Yubaba lives.

229
00:30:49,787 --> 00:30:51,379
Get over here.

230
00:30:56,466 --> 00:30:58,776
You want to lose your nose?

231
00:31:08,986 --> 00:31:10,782
More appetizers.

232
00:31:10,866 --> 00:31:13,983
- I've run out of those.
- They're not spicy enough.

233
00:31:22,864 --> 00:31:25,095
- We're halfway there. Just stay close.
- Okay.

234
00:31:29,784 --> 00:31:31,263
Here we go.

235
00:31:34,304 --> 00:31:35,942
The radish spirit.

236
00:31:41,663 --> 00:31:43,858
Sorry, sir. This elevator
doesn't go any higher.

237
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,537
You'll have to take
another one. Thank you.

238
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:11,375
- He's following us.
- Just don't look at him.

239
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,414
Step out to the right,
please, gentlemen.

240
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,460
Your rooms are right this way.

241
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:41,369
- Rin?
- What?

242
00:32:42,978 --> 00:32:46,414
What's that smell?
It's human.

243
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:49,377
- You smell just like a human.
- Oh, really?

244
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:52,895
Where's it coming from, Rin?
Come on.

245
00:32:52,978 --> 00:32:55,617
You're hiding something,
aren't you?

246
00:32:55,697 --> 00:32:59,406
- Show it to me.
- Is this what you smell?

247
00:32:59,498 --> 00:33:02,171
Roasted newt.

248
00:33:02,257 --> 00:33:05,533
No way, frog. I'm saving
every last bite for myself.

249
00:33:05,618 --> 00:33:08,450
Please, just a little bit?
Just give me a leg.

250
00:33:10,017 --> 00:33:12,814
If you want to go up,
pull the lever on your right.

251
00:34:58,089 --> 00:35:00,159
Aren't you even
going to knock?

252
00:35:00,249 --> 00:35:03,878
You're the most pathetic
little girl I've ever seen.

253
00:35:14,128 --> 00:35:16,163
Well, come in.

254
00:35:19,648 --> 00:35:21,525
I said come in!

255
00:35:48,725 --> 00:35:51,479
Quiet down.
You're making a racket.

256
00:36:10,204 --> 00:36:11,636
Excuse me?

257
00:36:11,724 --> 00:36:14,158
I was wondering
if you could give me a job.

258
00:36:22,724 --> 00:36:25,715
I don't want to hear
such a stupid request.

259
00:36:25,803 --> 00:36:29,112
You're just a stinking,
useless weakling.

260
00:36:29,203 --> 00:36:33,082
And this is certainly
no place for humans.

261
00:36:34,562 --> 00:36:37,315
It's a bathhouse for the spirits.

262
00:36:37,402 --> 00:36:41,519
It's where they come
to replenish themselves.

263
00:36:41,602 --> 00:36:46,437
And you humans always make
a mess of things, like your parents...

264
00:36:46,521 --> 00:36:51,470
who gobbled up the food
of the spirits like pigs.

265
00:36:51,561 --> 00:36:57,192
They got what they deserved.
And you should be punished too.

266
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,717
You could be a piglet.

267
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,759
Or maybe you'd prefer
a lump of coal.

268
00:37:14,479 --> 00:37:16,231
I can see you shaking.

269
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,550
Actually, I'm impressed
you made it this far.

270
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:23,268
But I'm sure you didn't
do it on your own.

271
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,919
Let's thank
whoever helped you.

272
00:37:25,999 --> 00:37:30,389
Just who was it, dear?
Why don't you tell me.

273
00:37:33,038 --> 00:37:34,949
Please!
Can't you give me a job?

274
00:37:35,038 --> 00:37:38,155
- Don't start that again!
- Please! I just want to work!

275
00:37:38,237 --> 00:37:43,790
Don't say that!

276
00:37:47,278 --> 00:37:50,906
Why in the world do you think
I should give you a job?

277
00:37:50,997 --> 00:37:54,909
Anyone can see you're a lazy,
spoiled crybaby...

278
00:37:54,997 --> 00:37:57,590
and you have no manners.

279
00:37:57,676 --> 00:38:00,907
This is a high-class place
I'm running here.

280
00:38:00,996 --> 00:38:03,590
So there's no job for you.
Now get out.

281
00:38:03,676 --> 00:38:06,429
I've got all the lazy bums I need.

282
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:12,793
Or maybe I'll give you
the most diffiicult job I've got...

283
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:18,825
and work you until you
breathe your very last breath.

284
00:38:31,354 --> 00:38:34,630
Oh, dear!
You woke up the baby.

285
00:38:35,554 --> 00:38:38,784
Mommy's here.
Be a good boy now.

286
00:38:38,874 --> 00:38:41,148
Why are you still here?
I told you to leave.

287
00:38:41,233 --> 00:38:43,190
I want you
to give me a job, please!

288
00:38:43,273 --> 00:38:46,549
Quiet down.
You're scaring the baby... Ooh!

289
00:38:46,993 --> 00:38:50,542
Hi, sweetie.
Don't be angry.

290
00:38:51,713 --> 00:38:54,181
That's a good boy.

291
00:38:54,272 --> 00:38:56,581
I'm not leaving
until you give me a job!

292
00:38:56,672 --> 00:38:59,664
Okay. Okay. Just be quiet.

293
00:38:59,752 --> 00:39:04,666
Here comes Mommy.
I'm coming to get you.

294
00:39:24,551 --> 00:39:26,506
That's your contract.

295
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:29,548
Sign your name away...

296
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:32,018
and I'll put you to work.

297
00:39:32,109 --> 00:39:34,465
If I hear one little complaint
out of you...

298
00:39:34,549 --> 00:39:37,507
you'll be joining your parents
in the pigpen.

299
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:40,262
So l...
Do I sign my name here?

300
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:43,580
Just sign it!
Do you want the job or not?

301
00:39:48,629 --> 00:39:51,222
I can't believe
I took that oath...

302
00:39:51,308 --> 00:39:54,220
to give a job
to anyone who asks.

303
00:39:55,388 --> 00:40:00,017
Ridiculous. I hate being
so nice all the time. Ha!

304
00:40:00,868 --> 00:40:02,778
Are you done yet?

305
00:40:07,067 --> 00:40:10,264
- So your name's Chihiro.
- Yes, ma'am.

306
00:40:10,347 --> 00:40:13,258
What a pretty name.

307
00:40:22,306 --> 00:40:25,457
And it belongs to me now.

308
00:40:25,546 --> 00:40:28,822
From now on your name
is Sen. You got that?

309
00:40:28,905 --> 00:40:31,500
- Answer me, Sen!
- Oh. Yes, ma'am.

310
00:40:32,186 --> 00:40:34,415
You called for me?

311
00:40:36,425 --> 00:40:39,894
This girl signed a contract.
Set her up with a job.

312
00:40:39,985 --> 00:40:42,817
Right. What's your name?

313
00:40:42,905 --> 00:40:46,453
What? Chih...
Oh, it's Sen.

314
00:40:46,545 --> 00:40:48,740
Okay, Sen, follow me.

315
00:40:57,384 --> 00:41:00,932
- Haku, uh...
- Don't talk to me.

316
00:41:01,024 --> 00:41:03,253
And address me
as Master Haku.

317
00:41:18,502 --> 00:41:21,937
I don't care if Yubaba
gets angry with us.

318
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:23,933
We're not taking humans.

319
00:41:24,022 --> 00:41:26,661
- She's already under contract.
- What?

320
00:41:26,741 --> 00:41:28,299
I promise to work very hard.

321
00:41:28,381 --> 00:41:30,497
We are not going to take her
in our department.

322
00:41:30,581 --> 00:41:32,060
She'll stink up the whole place.

323
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:35,938
Three days of eating our food
and her smell will go away.

324
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:38,581
And if she doesn't work hard,
roast her...

325
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,459
boil her,
do whatever you want.

326
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,054
Now get back to work.
Where is Rin?

327
00:41:44,141 --> 00:41:46,574
What? Don't you
dump her on me!

328
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,571
You said
you wanted an assistant.

329
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,810
That's perfect.
Give the girl to Rin.

330
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,811
- Oh, great.
- Sen, get going.

331
00:41:52,899 --> 00:41:54,651
Right.

332
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,652
Why are you picking on me?
You owe me one, Haku, you hear me?

333
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,297
Have a nice day.

334
00:42:00,379 --> 00:42:01,653
Hmph.

335
00:42:02,659 --> 00:42:04,456
Come on.

336
00:42:13,018 --> 00:42:14,974
- I can't believe you pulled it off.
- Huh?

337
00:42:15,058 --> 00:42:17,049
You're such a dope.
I was really worried.

338
00:42:17,138 --> 00:42:20,732
Now keep on your toes. And if
you need anything, ask me, okay?

339
00:42:20,818 --> 00:42:24,572
- Okay.
- Hmm? What's wrong?

340
00:42:25,577 --> 00:42:27,568
I don't feel so good.

341
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:34,615
So this is our room.

342
00:42:34,696 --> 00:42:37,335
A little food and some sleep
and you'll be fiine.

343
00:42:40,656 --> 00:42:43,773
Here's your apron. You have
to wash it yourself. Your pants.

344
00:42:44,536 --> 00:42:46,366
You're so puny.

345
00:42:47,496 --> 00:42:48,815
Way too big.

346
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:53,608
- Rin, you know Haku?
- What about him?

347
00:42:53,695 --> 00:42:55,811
There aren't two of him
here, are they?

348
00:42:55,896 --> 00:42:58,807
Two Hakus?
I can barely stand one.

349
00:43:00,214 --> 00:43:02,012
Too big.
He's Yubaba's henchman.

350
00:43:02,094 --> 00:43:03,925
Don't trust anything he says.

351
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:09,131
Let's see.

352
00:43:10,134 --> 00:43:13,444
Aha. Here we go.

353
00:43:13,534 --> 00:43:15,888
Wh-What...
What's wrong with you?

354
00:43:15,974 --> 00:43:18,488
Are you feeling okay?

355
00:43:18,573 --> 00:43:21,087
Quiet down.
What's your problem?

356
00:43:21,173 --> 00:43:24,085
It's the new girl.
She doesn't feel so good.

357
00:44:55,567 --> 00:45:00,322
Meet me at the bridge.
I'll take you to your parents.

358
00:45:44,203 --> 00:45:46,319
My shoes are gone.

359
00:45:51,362 --> 00:45:52,636
Huh?

360
00:45:59,721 --> 00:46:01,440
Thank you.

361
00:47:09,637 --> 00:47:11,195
Follow me.

362
00:47:54,033 --> 00:47:58,549
Mom! Dad! Are you all right?
It's me, Sen! Hey, wake up!

363
00:47:58,634 --> 00:48:01,670
Mom! Dad!

364
00:48:04,713 --> 00:48:06,749
What's wrong with them?
Are they sick?

365
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:09,552
No. They ate too much.
They're sleeping it off.

366
00:48:09,632 --> 00:48:13,591
They don't remember
being human.

367
00:48:18,872 --> 00:48:21,181
Don't you worry! I promise
I'll get you out of here!

368
00:48:21,272 --> 00:48:24,502
So just don't get any fatter!
Or they'll eat you!

369
00:48:32,871 --> 00:48:35,339
Here are your clothes.
Hide them.

370
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:39,387
I thought they'd
been thrown away.

371
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:41,904
You'll need them to get home.

372
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,981
My goodbye card's still here.

373
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:52,423
Chihiro.

374
00:48:52,509 --> 00:48:56,263
Chihiro.
That's my name, isn't it?

375
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,421
That's how Yubaba controls you,
by stealing your name.

376
00:48:59,509 --> 00:49:01,943
So hold on to that card.
Keep it hidden.

377
00:49:02,029 --> 00:49:04,338
And while you're here,
you must call yourself Sen.

378
00:49:04,428 --> 00:49:08,182
I can't believe I forgot my name.
She almost took it from me.

379
00:49:08,269 --> 00:49:12,227
If you completely forget it,
you'll never fiind your way home.

380
00:49:12,308 --> 00:49:15,186
I've tried everything
to remember mine.

381
00:49:15,268 --> 00:49:17,179
You can't remember
your name?

382
00:49:17,268 --> 00:49:20,305
No. But for some reason
I remember yours.

383
00:49:23,267 --> 00:49:26,020
Here you go. Eat this.
You must be hungry.

384
00:49:26,107 --> 00:49:27,745
No.

385
00:49:27,827 --> 00:49:31,820
I put a spell on it so it'll give you
back your strength. Just eat it.

386
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:10,614
Have some more.
You'll be all right.

387
00:50:25,583 --> 00:50:28,336
- Just stay out of trouble.
- Thank you, Haku.

388
00:50:28,423 --> 00:50:30,414
You're a good friend.

389
00:52:04,594 --> 00:52:07,393
Where were you, Sen?
I was really worried.

390
00:52:07,474 --> 00:52:08,623
I'm sorry.

391
00:52:18,074 --> 00:52:19,746
Out of my way.

392
00:52:32,393 --> 00:52:35,032
Hey, Sen, haven't you ever
worked a day in your life?

393
00:52:35,112 --> 00:52:37,945
Rin and Sen,
you get the big tub today.

394
00:52:38,033 --> 00:52:40,262
What?
Hey, that's frog work.

395
00:52:40,352 --> 00:52:43,389
Orders from the top.
So quit your complaining.

396
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:05,461
Hello. Aren't you getting
wet out there?

397
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:12,428
- Sen, hurry up!
- Coming.

398
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:14,501
I'll leave the door
open for you.

399
00:53:42,188 --> 00:53:44,382
- Heard you got the big tub, Rin.
- Leave me alone.

400
00:53:48,307 --> 00:53:50,981
Those jerks. They haven't
cleaned this tub in months.

401
00:54:05,746 --> 00:54:07,976
We only use this tub
for our really fiilthy guests.

402
00:54:08,066 --> 00:54:10,705
Disgusting. This sludge is so caked on,
it'll take days to scrub off.

403
00:54:10,786 --> 00:54:13,458
Rin, Sen, you've got
some customers on the way.

404
00:54:13,546 --> 00:54:17,140
Wait. Give us a minute.
This is clearly harassment.

405
00:54:17,226 --> 00:54:19,057
We'll have to soak it off.

406
00:54:19,145 --> 00:54:22,058
- Get an herbal soak token
from the foreman.
- A what?

407
00:54:25,025 --> 00:54:27,664
- An herbal soak token.
- Right.

408
00:54:29,225 --> 00:54:31,055
Hey, Rin, what's a foreman?

409
00:54:33,705 --> 00:54:37,538
Hmm. Something's coming.
I wonder what.

410
00:54:47,023 --> 00:54:50,732
What useless scum
is slinking around in the rain?

411
00:55:15,221 --> 00:55:19,931
I can't waste a token on you.
Relax. Good morning.

412
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:21,977
Enjoy. Have a nice bath.

413
00:55:22,061 --> 00:55:26,134
- For the radish spirit.
- One sulfur soak.

414
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,688
Why are you still standing here?
Scrub it yourself.

415
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:30,692
I'm not giving you a token.

416
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:33,692
Relax. Good morning.
I said scrub it yourself.

417
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:37,216
But I was told
it has to have an herbal soak.

418
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:41,133
Well, that's too bad.
Huh? Mugwort bath?

419
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:43,210
Relax and enjoy it.

420
00:55:50,179 --> 00:55:52,135
Hmm?

421
00:55:52,218 --> 00:55:55,608
Foreman speaking.
Oh, yes. Huh? What?

422
00:55:55,699 --> 00:55:58,132
Thank you very much.

423
00:55:58,218 --> 00:56:00,778
Get back here! Hey!
Wait a minute!

424
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:03,497
<i>- What's going on?
- Nothing. Everything's fiine.</i>

425
00:56:03,577 --> 00:56:06,251
<i>- We have an intruder.
- Is it a human? </i>

426
00:56:06,337 --> 00:56:09,534
I'm not quite sure.
Figure it out and report back.

427
00:56:09,618 --> 00:56:12,336
Wow, Sen.
You got a really good one.

428
00:56:12,417 --> 00:56:14,806
Clip this on, then let go.

429
00:56:16,257 --> 00:56:19,248
It goes straight to Kamajii,
then he sends us our water.

430
00:56:24,256 --> 00:56:27,169
You pull on this to start
the water flowing. Give it a try.

431
00:56:35,936 --> 00:56:38,290
Uhh. You're such a klutz.

432
00:56:38,376 --> 00:56:40,331
Yuck! What's in this water?

433
00:56:40,415 --> 00:56:42,849
Dried worm salts.
It's supposed to be good for you.

434
00:56:42,935 --> 00:56:46,449
And with water this murky, you
can't see all the sludge in the tub.

435
00:56:48,415 --> 00:56:51,451
Yank it again when
the bath is full. It'll stop.

436
00:56:51,535 --> 00:56:54,924
You can let go of the rope now.
I'll go get us some breakfast.

437
00:56:55,014 --> 00:56:56,766
Okay.

438
00:57:17,452 --> 00:57:19,125
Ow!

439
00:57:24,972 --> 00:57:27,406
Uh, sir, the bath's
not ready yet.

440
00:57:33,051 --> 00:57:34,643
There's so many.

441
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:39,243
What? They're all for me?

442
00:57:42,771 --> 00:57:44,887
Thanks, but I don't
need any more.

443
00:57:47,451 --> 00:57:49,406
No. I only need one.

444
00:58:04,409 --> 00:58:06,559
- Oh, Yubaba.
- It's a stink spirit.

445
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,799
And apparently,
it's an extra smelly one.

446
00:58:08,889 --> 00:58:10,845
He... He's headed
straight for the bridge.

447
00:58:10,928 --> 00:58:13,317
- Go away!
- Go away!

448
00:58:13,409 --> 00:58:17,367
No, no, we're closed! Go away!
No! Hey! We're not open!

449
00:58:17,448 --> 00:58:19,962
No, please!
No! Leave us!

450
00:58:22,928 --> 00:58:27,284
Hmm. Something's fiishy. That doesn't
seem like a stink spirit to me.

451
00:58:27,368 --> 00:58:29,598
But we have no choice.
Go greet him.

452
00:58:29,688 --> 00:58:34,124
Just give him a bath and get him
out of here as fast as you can.

453
00:58:34,207 --> 00:58:36,880
Everybody go back
to your rooms!

454
00:58:40,047 --> 00:58:43,119
- Sen, Yubaba wants to see you.
- Yes, sir.

455
00:58:43,206 --> 00:58:45,640
Sen, don't mess this up.

456
00:58:45,727 --> 00:58:48,878
Take this guest to the big tub
and take care of him.

457
00:58:48,966 --> 00:58:51,877
- But... But l...
- No buts or I'll turn you into coal.

458
00:58:51,966 --> 00:58:55,038
- You hear me?
- Ahh! It's here.

459
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:07,434
Hands down.
You'll insult our guest.

460
00:59:15,404 --> 00:59:19,716
Look, a valued customer.
Welcome to our baths.

461
00:59:21,763 --> 00:59:24,437
Ahh! Eww! Ohh!
Oh, it's money.

462
00:59:24,524 --> 00:59:26,912
Sen, take the nice
customer's money.

463
00:59:27,003 --> 00:59:28,834
Yes, ma'am.

464
00:59:36,922 --> 00:59:40,437
Don't make him wait.
Get him to the bath.

465
00:59:41,602 --> 00:59:43,194
This way.

466
00:59:57,401 --> 00:59:59,392
Eww!

467
01:00:01,801 --> 01:00:03,631
Sen!

468
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,310
- Our food!
- Open the windows, all of them!

469
01:00:57,557 --> 01:00:59,946
What? Just a minute, sir.

470
01:01:06,076 --> 01:01:08,795
- Disgusting?
- I don't think it's very funny.

471
01:01:08,876 --> 01:01:11,310
Let's see what she'll do next.

472
01:01:15,195 --> 01:01:17,265
Look. She wants to refiill the tub.

473
01:01:17,356 --> 01:01:20,347
Oh, dear! She's gonna waste
all our good water!

474
01:01:33,554 --> 01:01:37,104
- Who gave her all the bath tokens?
- Don't look at me. I didn't do it.

475
01:02:19,551 --> 01:02:22,065
Oh, no!
That's our best herbal formula!

476
01:02:48,029 --> 01:02:50,065
Sen! Sen, where are you?

477
01:02:50,149 --> 01:02:52,902
- Over here!
- Don't worry.

478
01:02:52,989 --> 01:02:55,628
St-Stay right where you are.
I'm coming to help you.

479
01:02:55,708 --> 01:02:58,176
You're gonna be fiine.
I won't let him hurt you.

480
01:02:58,268 --> 01:03:02,147
I think he needs help. It feels
like there's a thorn in his side.

481
01:03:02,228 --> 01:03:04,696
- A thorn?
- It won't come out!

482
01:03:04,788 --> 01:03:08,667
What's that?
He has a thorn? Hmm.

483
01:03:08,748 --> 01:03:11,580
- Get the staff down there.
- Huh?
- Step on it!

484
01:03:14,787 --> 01:03:16,742
Listen to me.

485
01:03:16,827 --> 01:03:19,216
That's no stink spirit
we have on our hands.

486
01:03:21,587 --> 01:03:23,861
- Grab onto this rope.
- Right!

487
01:03:33,106 --> 01:03:35,574
- Hold on tight.
- Got it.

488
01:03:35,665 --> 01:03:39,579
Hurry up, now.
Everyone get in there and help them.

489
01:03:39,665 --> 01:03:41,577
We've got it tied on!

490
01:03:43,025 --> 01:03:46,415
Everyone, ready on my command.

491
01:03:46,504 --> 01:03:49,099
And... heave!

492
01:03:49,184 --> 01:03:53,736
- And... heave!
- Heave!

493
01:03:54,184 --> 01:03:56,618
- And... heave!
- Heave!

494
01:03:56,704 --> 01:04:01,220
And heave!

495
01:04:04,223 --> 01:04:05,861
A bicycle?

496
01:04:05,944 --> 01:04:09,140
Thought so.
Get ready, now!

497
01:04:09,223 --> 01:04:14,377
Heave!

498
01:04:43,381 --> 01:04:46,020
Sen! Sen, where are you?

499
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:58,934
Well done.

500
01:05:04,019 --> 01:05:06,169
Huh?

501
01:05:28,498 --> 01:05:33,332
- Gold!
- Hey, wait! That's company property!

502
01:05:33,417 --> 01:05:36,853
Back off! Our guest
is still here, you idiots!

503
01:05:42,657 --> 01:05:45,693
Sen, you're in our guest's way.
Step aside.

504
01:05:45,776 --> 01:05:48,415
Open the main gates! Make way!

505
01:06:14,974 --> 01:06:20,094
Sen, you did great!
We made so much money!

506
01:06:20,174 --> 01:06:24,406
That spirit is rich and powerful.
Everyone, learn from Sen.

507
01:06:24,493 --> 01:06:27,292
Sake's on the house tonight.

508
01:06:27,373 --> 01:06:30,888
But fiirst, hand over
all the gold you picked up.

509
01:06:30,974 --> 01:06:34,363
- That's not fair!
- How stingy! That's no fair!

510
01:07:32,246 --> 01:07:34,884
There's so much water.
It looks like a sea.

511
01:07:34,965 --> 01:07:38,003
What'd you expect after all that rain?

512
01:07:40,085 --> 01:07:44,397
I've gotta get out of this place.
Someday, I'm getting on that train.

513
01:08:08,403 --> 01:08:11,122
What's wrong?

514
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,960
It's gold! Huh?

515
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,996
What do you think you're doing?
You're not allowed in there.

516
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,436
The bath's closed.
Get out, you! Get out of there!

517
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:56,636
Ooh! Oh!
More gold!

518
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:59,631
Are you... Are you...
Are you giving them to me?

519
01:09:04,879 --> 01:09:06,869
Wait. You can make gold?

520
01:09:10,839 --> 01:09:12,430
Uh, gimme!

521
01:09:20,517 --> 01:09:23,395
What's going on in there?

522
01:09:23,478 --> 01:09:25,946
It's way past bedtime.
Come on!

523
01:09:26,038 --> 01:09:27,630
Wh...

524
01:09:29,397 --> 01:09:32,594
Hey, boss, up here.
I'm hungry. Starving!

525
01:09:32,678 --> 01:09:35,032
- And I want you to serve me.
- I know that voice.

526
01:09:35,117 --> 01:09:39,713
Here, I'll pay you up front.
And I wanna take a bath too.

527
01:09:39,797 --> 01:09:41,946
Why don't you wake everyone up?

528
01:09:47,597 --> 01:09:50,315
Mom, Dad, I got a gift
from the river spirit!

529
01:09:50,396 --> 01:09:53,069
Maybe if you eat it,
it'll break the spell.

530
01:09:58,035 --> 01:10:01,584
Which ones are you?
Mom, Dad!

531
01:10:13,074 --> 01:10:15,429
Bad dream.

532
01:10:15,514 --> 01:10:17,822
Rin?

533
01:10:20,754 --> 01:10:22,665
Where is everybody?

534
01:10:28,993 --> 01:10:31,223
Wow. It really is a sea.

535
01:10:36,912 --> 01:10:39,507
I sure hope they're
doing all right over there.

536
01:10:43,832 --> 01:10:45,823
Kamajii lit the boiler already?

537
01:10:45,912 --> 01:10:48,823
How long was I asleep?

538
01:10:48,912 --> 01:10:51,301
Hurry up!

539
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:54,304
Come on, he's starving!
Can't you cook any faster?

540
01:10:54,391 --> 01:10:58,430
Serve everything you've got,
even leftovers if you have to.
Hurry up! He's starving!

541
01:11:00,431 --> 01:11:02,819
- Hey, Sen.
- Oh, Rin.

542
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:05,424
I was just coming to wake you up.
Look.

543
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:07,899
It's real gold.
There's a new guest here who's loaded.

544
01:11:07,990 --> 01:11:10,424
He's giving gold away
by the handfuls!

545
01:11:21,469 --> 01:11:25,542
Just keep the food coming.
I wanna eat everything!

546
01:11:29,589 --> 01:11:32,467
- Who is the guest?
- Oh, who cares?

547
01:11:32,549 --> 01:11:34,823
Come on,
before Yubaba wakes up.

548
01:11:34,909 --> 01:11:36,819
I'm going to go look for Haku.

549
01:11:36,909 --> 01:11:39,945
Oh! Would you quit
worrying about Haku?

550
01:11:40,028 --> 01:11:42,258
- Come on, Sen. Let's go get some gold.
- Come on, Rin!

551
01:11:42,347 --> 01:11:44,464
- Let's go get some more!
- You bet!

552
01:12:09,066 --> 01:12:13,025
He better get here before
I forget what my parents look like.

553
01:12:13,106 --> 01:12:15,824
I sure hope
Dad hasn't gotten too fat.

554
01:12:44,463 --> 01:12:47,500
It's Haku! He's back!

555
01:12:50,422 --> 01:12:52,857
Are birds chasing him?

556
01:13:03,302 --> 01:13:06,338
Haku! Fight 'em!
Come on!

557
01:13:06,422 --> 01:13:09,255
He's hurt!
Haku, this way!

558
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:29,569
Huh? It's just paper.

559
01:13:58,098 --> 01:14:00,407
Haku, you're bleeding.

560
01:14:05,978 --> 01:14:10,927
Hold still. Those paper things are
gone now. You're going to be all right.

561
01:14:23,937 --> 01:14:25,847
He went in that top window.

562
01:14:25,936 --> 01:14:28,894
I've got to get there
before he bleeds to death!

563
01:14:36,455 --> 01:14:40,005
<i>Welcome the rich man
He's hard for you to miss</i>

564
01:14:40,095 --> 01:14:44,929
<i>His butt keeps getting bigger
so there's plenty there to kiss</i>

565
01:14:45,015 --> 01:14:49,007
- Oh, hey, everybody, bow down.
- Welcome, rich man.

566
01:14:49,095 --> 01:14:52,245
<i>Beg for tips
This is the time</i>

567
01:14:52,335 --> 01:14:55,610
<i>Beg for tips
Make yourselves a dime</i>

568
01:14:57,213 --> 01:15:01,002
Give me some dough!
Give me some tips, please, sir!

569
01:15:01,093 --> 01:15:05,166
I'll do anything for you!
Just give me some tips!

570
01:15:08,973 --> 01:15:11,441
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Going upstairs.

571
01:15:11,533 --> 01:15:15,525
No, you're not.
Huh? Blood!

572
01:15:19,692 --> 01:15:21,684
Get out of the way!
Our guest is coming through here!

573
01:15:23,412 --> 01:15:25,289
Thank you for helping me earlier.

574
01:15:25,372 --> 01:15:28,330
- Don't talk to him, you stinking hum...
- Hey!

575
01:15:50,021 --> 01:15:51,613
I don't want any, but thanks.

576
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:57,252
I'm sorry,
but I'm in a really big hurry.

577
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:11,418
Hey, there! Hey!
Get back! Get back now!

578
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:14,298
Everybody, out!

579
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:18,134
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, sir.
You'll have to excuse the little girl.

580
01:16:18,219 --> 01:16:21,052
She's just a human.

581
01:16:22,299 --> 01:16:24,290
- Wipe that smile off your face.
- What?

582
01:16:24,378 --> 01:16:27,052
- You're still smiling.
- No, I'm not.

583
01:18:00,651 --> 01:18:02,563
It's Yubaba!

584
01:19:14,807 --> 01:19:18,004
We're in a big mess.

585
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:22,477
He's a No-Face!
It's all your fault. You're so greedy.

586
01:19:22,566 --> 01:19:25,683
You attract terrible guests.
All right, I'm on my way.

587
01:19:25,765 --> 01:19:29,759
Don't let him eat anyone else
till I get down there.

588
01:19:30,806 --> 01:19:33,763
Haku is bleeding all over the carpet.

589
01:19:33,845 --> 01:19:36,757
Get him out of here.
He'll be dead soon anyway.

590
01:19:59,403 --> 01:20:02,315
Hi, sweetie.
Hiding under the cushions again?

591
01:20:06,043 --> 01:20:10,355
Oh, I woke you,
and you were sound asleep.

592
01:20:10,442 --> 01:20:13,400
I'm sorry.
Let me give you a kiss.

593
01:20:16,322 --> 01:20:18,517
Go back to sleep, now.

594
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,751
Ow! Let go of me!

595
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:53,468
Wow, you're a big baby.
Would you mind letting go of me?

596
01:20:53,559 --> 01:20:57,188
- I'm in a really big hurry.
- You came in here to make me sick.

597
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:00,430
- Huh?
- You're a bad germ from outside,
aren't you?

598
01:21:00,519 --> 01:21:05,149
I'm not a germ, I'm a human.
Now, would you please let go of me?

599
01:21:05,239 --> 01:21:09,914
You'll get sick if you go outside.
So stay here and play with me.

600
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:12,512
- You won't get sick.
- Yes, you will.

601
01:21:12,598 --> 01:21:14,554
That's why I've never
left this room.

602
01:21:14,637 --> 01:21:17,391
Staying in this room
is what'll make you sick.

603
01:21:17,478 --> 01:21:21,437
Listen, someone very important
to me is terribly hurt.

604
01:21:21,517 --> 01:21:24,315
I've got to go right now,
so please let go of me.

605
01:21:24,397 --> 01:21:27,389
If you go I'll cry,
and Mama will hear me...

606
01:21:27,477 --> 01:21:29,832
and Mama will come in here
and kill you.

607
01:21:29,917 --> 01:21:33,192
- Play with me, or I'll break your arm.
- That hurts!

608
01:21:33,277 --> 01:21:35,472
Please!
I'll play with you later, okay?

609
01:21:35,556 --> 01:21:38,195
No, I wanna play now!

610
01:21:41,277 --> 01:21:43,551
Germs!
I've got germs, see?

611
01:21:55,196 --> 01:21:57,425
Haku! What are you doing?

612
01:21:57,515 --> 01:22:00,109
Get away! Get back!
Haku, are you okay?

613
01:22:00,194 --> 01:22:02,186
Can you hear me?

614
01:22:02,275 --> 01:22:04,629
Shut your mouth! Haku!

615
01:22:08,994 --> 01:22:11,064
Get back!

616
01:22:13,994 --> 01:22:16,030
Stop it!

617
01:22:29,993 --> 01:22:33,905
I'm not afraid of germs.
If you don't play with me, I'll cry.

618
01:22:33,993 --> 01:22:36,460
Please don't cry.
Just wait.

619
01:22:36,552 --> 01:22:39,019
Right now, or I'll start crying.

620
01:22:41,272 --> 01:22:42,830
Don't cry! Don't cry!

621
01:22:42,912 --> 01:22:46,142
What a spoiled brat!

622
01:22:47,191 --> 01:22:51,150
Shut your big mouth!
You're a bit of a porker, aren't you?

623
01:22:57,831 --> 01:23:00,867
- Still see-through.
- Mama?

624
01:23:00,951 --> 01:23:05,978
You pea-brain. Can't you even
tell me from your own mother?

625
01:23:13,949 --> 01:23:16,942
There, now.
Your body matches your brain.

626
01:23:17,029 --> 01:23:19,987
Let's see.
What else can we mess with?

627
01:23:38,148 --> 01:23:40,980
This is our little secret.
You tell anyone else...

628
01:23:41,068 --> 01:23:42,864
and I'll rip your mouth out.

629
01:23:44,388 --> 01:23:48,460
- Who are you?
- Zeniba. I'm Yubaba's twin sister.

630
01:23:48,547 --> 01:23:52,459
It was nice of you to lead me
straight to this dragon's hiding place.

631
01:23:52,547 --> 01:23:55,664
- Now, hand him over to me.
- What do you want with Haku?

632
01:23:55,747 --> 01:23:58,214
- He's badly hurt.
- Too bad.

633
01:23:58,306 --> 01:24:00,615
He stole my solid gold seal.

634
01:24:00,706 --> 01:24:03,379
It's magic and powerful,
and I want it back!

635
01:24:03,466 --> 01:24:06,264
Haku wouldn't steal.
He's a good person.

636
01:24:06,346 --> 01:24:10,464
Huh! Do you know why
he became my sister's apprentice?

637
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:15,016
To steal her magic secrets,
and now he's stolen my magic too.

638
01:24:15,105 --> 01:24:19,257
He's a greedy little thief.
There's nothing good about him.

639
01:24:19,344 --> 01:24:24,372
Step aside, little girl.
I'm going to take my seal back from him.

640
01:24:24,464 --> 01:24:29,492
There's a spell on the seal,
and anyone who steals it will die.

641
01:24:30,344 --> 01:24:32,494
No, you can't!

642
01:24:39,583 --> 01:24:41,699
You idiots!
What's your problem?

643
01:24:41,784 --> 01:24:44,217
Keep quiet.
I don't want my sister coming up here.

644
01:24:51,862 --> 01:24:54,422
Ow. A paper cut.

645
01:24:54,662 --> 01:24:57,017
Haku, we're falling!

646
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:18,660
Haku!

647
01:25:46,539 --> 01:25:49,655
- What's going on here?
- Haku!
- Sen, be careful! Stay back!

648
01:25:52,498 --> 01:25:53,897
Haku!

649
01:25:57,458 --> 01:25:59,369
What's wrong with you?

650
01:26:02,578 --> 01:26:05,011
This looks serious.

651
01:26:06,697 --> 01:26:09,894
Haku, don't give up!
What do we do? Is he dying?

652
01:26:09,977 --> 01:26:13,366
It looks like he's bleeding
from the inside.

653
01:26:13,457 --> 01:26:16,050
- From the inside?
- I think so.

654
01:26:16,137 --> 01:26:17,774
Maybe he swallowed something.

655
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:21,531
Haku, I got this gift
from the river spirit.

656
01:26:21,616 --> 01:26:23,652
Eat it.
Maybe it'll help.

657
01:26:25,736 --> 01:26:28,125
Come on!
Open your mouth!

658
01:26:28,216 --> 01:26:30,968
Please, Haku!
Eat it!

659
01:26:32,895 --> 01:26:36,888
- See? It's okay.
- Medicine from the river spirit.

660
01:26:36,975 --> 01:26:40,206
Open your mouth.
That's it.

661
01:26:43,974 --> 01:26:46,967
Got it.
Now swallow.

662
01:27:05,653 --> 01:27:08,611
Sen, look there!

663
01:27:19,851 --> 01:27:23,003
- The gold seal!
- Get that black slug!
Over there! Get it!

664
01:27:42,811 --> 01:27:45,324
Hurry, before it rubs off on you!

665
01:27:49,450 --> 01:27:53,409
- Evil, be gone!
- Haku stole this seal
from Yubaba's sister.

666
01:27:53,489 --> 01:27:56,959
Zeniba's solid gold
monogrammed seal.

667
01:27:57,049 --> 01:27:59,244
That's as powerful as it gets.

668
01:28:01,649 --> 01:28:05,357
Look! He's changed back.
Help me. What do we do?

669
01:28:07,569 --> 01:28:09,958
Haku! Haku, wake up!

670
01:28:12,088 --> 01:28:14,124
Zeniba put a curse on the seal.

671
01:28:14,208 --> 01:28:17,996
That's strong magic.
It's made him gravely ill.

672
01:28:27,367 --> 01:28:30,165
That should make him more comfortable.

673
01:28:32,887 --> 01:28:36,640
Poor Haku. He's had it hard
ever since he got here.

674
01:28:36,726 --> 01:28:40,639
He just showed up out of nowhere,
just like you did.

675
01:28:40,726 --> 01:28:44,401
But he got mixed up with Yubaba.
He took a job as her apprentice.

676
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:46,919
I warned him it was too dangerous.

677
01:28:47,006 --> 01:28:50,042
"Just quit. Go back home,"
I told him.

678
01:28:50,126 --> 01:28:54,199
But he said for some reason
he had no home to return to.

679
01:28:54,285 --> 01:28:56,515
Once Yubaba got control over him...

680
01:28:56,605 --> 01:29:00,439
his face turned pale
and his eyes turned steely.

681
01:29:00,525 --> 01:29:03,755
He's never been the same.

682
01:29:03,845 --> 01:29:07,757
Kamajii, what if I take
the gold seal back to Zeniba?

683
01:29:07,844 --> 01:29:11,473
I could give back the seal
and apologize to her for Haku.

684
01:29:11,564 --> 01:29:13,634
Can you tell me where Zeniba lives?

685
01:29:13,724 --> 01:29:16,033
You'd go to Zeniba's?

686
01:29:16,124 --> 01:29:18,843
It might help,
but she's one dangerous witch.

687
01:29:18,923 --> 01:29:22,155
Please?
Haku helped me before.

688
01:29:22,243 --> 01:29:23,881
Now I wanna help him.

689
01:29:25,642 --> 01:29:28,475
I know how you can get there...

690
01:29:28,563 --> 01:29:31,316
but you'll have to get back
on your own.

691
01:29:31,402 --> 01:29:33,870
Wait here.

692
01:29:35,123 --> 01:29:38,637
Let's see, now.
I know it's around here somewhere.

693
01:29:39,442 --> 01:29:42,400
Everyone, I need my shoes
and clothes, please.

694
01:29:51,001 --> 01:29:53,673
Sen! I've looked everywhere for you.

695
01:29:56,401 --> 01:29:58,631
- Rin!
- There's blood everywhere.

696
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:01,917
What's going on here?
Who are those guys?

697
01:30:02,001 --> 01:30:05,310
I picked up some new friends.
See?

698
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:08,756
- Everyone's looking for you.
Yubaba is furious.
- Huh?

699
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:12,549
The guy with all the gold turned out
to be a monster called "No-Face."

700
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:15,756
And he says that you
let him into the bathhouse.

701
01:30:18,919 --> 01:30:21,114
I did let him in.

702
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:24,315
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. I thought he was a customer.

703
01:30:24,399 --> 01:30:27,357
What? He's a monster.
He's already swallowed three people.

704
01:30:27,438 --> 01:30:31,067
Found it!
Here it is, Sen.

705
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:35,595
- Hey, we're busy, boiler man.
- You can use this.

706
01:30:35,678 --> 01:30:38,875
You've got train tickets?
Uh, how did you get a hold of them?

707
01:30:38,958 --> 01:30:41,518
I've been saving them for 40 years.

708
01:30:41,597 --> 01:30:45,226
Now, listen carefully. The train stop
you want is called Swamp Bottom.

709
01:30:45,318 --> 01:30:47,831
- Swamp Bottom?
- That's where Zeniba lives.

710
01:30:47,917 --> 01:30:49,714
- The sixth stop.
- Sixth stop.

711
01:30:49,797 --> 01:30:53,790
Make sure you get it right. The train
used to run in both directions...

712
01:30:53,876 --> 01:30:55,753
but these days it's a one-way ride.

713
01:30:55,836 --> 01:30:57,475
Still want to go?

714
01:30:57,556 --> 01:31:02,152
Yep. I'll walk back
along the tracks.

715
01:31:02,236 --> 01:31:06,275
- Sen, what about No-Face?
- I'll take care of that now.

716
01:31:06,355 --> 01:31:10,269
Haku, I'll be back soon.
Just hold on.

717
01:31:10,355 --> 01:31:15,509
- What's going on?
- Something you wouldn't recognize.
It's called "love."

718
01:31:23,355 --> 01:31:26,107
- He just keeps getting bigger!
- I'm scared.

719
01:31:26,195 --> 01:31:28,629
- I don't wanna be eaten by it.
- It's her.

720
01:31:36,154 --> 01:31:39,624
Oh, Sen, thank goodness.
Yubaba can't hold him off much longer.

721
01:31:43,073 --> 01:31:47,385
There's no need to get upset.
I'm sure they'll fiind Sen somewhere.

722
01:31:47,472 --> 01:31:49,940
Where is Sen?
I want Sen!

723
01:31:50,032 --> 01:31:52,227
Hurry! This way!

724
01:31:57,352 --> 01:32:00,822
- Madam, Sen is here now.
- Finally!

725
01:32:00,912 --> 01:32:05,780
Sen has arrived, sir. She'll be
with you in just a few minutes.

726
01:32:05,872 --> 01:32:09,659
He's destroying everything.
It's costing us a fortune.

727
01:32:09,751 --> 01:32:13,710
So suck up to him and get
every last speck of gold he's...

728
01:32:15,791 --> 01:32:19,021
Eww! What's that
dirty mouse doing here?

729
01:32:19,110 --> 01:32:22,786
Huh? He's your...
He doesn't look familiar?

730
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:27,386
Familiar? Don't be stupid.
Now, get in there.

731
01:32:28,990 --> 01:32:31,379
Here's Sen.

732
01:32:31,469 --> 01:32:34,666
Will Sen be all right
in there by herself?

733
01:32:34,750 --> 01:32:37,707
- You wanna take her place?
- Huh?

734
01:32:56,828 --> 01:33:00,422
Try this.
It's delicious.

735
01:33:02,067 --> 01:33:06,458
Want some gold?
I'm not giving it to anybody else.

736
01:33:10,067 --> 01:33:13,979
Come closer, Sen.
What would you like?

737
01:33:14,067 --> 01:33:15,977
Just name it.

738
01:33:16,067 --> 01:33:18,137
I would like to leave, sir.

739
01:33:18,226 --> 01:33:20,740
I have someplace I need
to go to right away, please.

740
01:33:23,346 --> 01:33:25,541
You should go back
to where you came from.

741
01:33:25,625 --> 01:33:28,743
Yubaba doesn't want you
in the bathhouse any longer.

742
01:33:30,825 --> 01:33:33,623
Where is your home?
Don't you have any friends or family?

743
01:33:34,505 --> 01:33:37,736
No. No!

744
01:33:37,825 --> 01:33:42,614
I'm lonely.
I'm lonely.

745
01:33:42,705 --> 01:33:44,775
What is it that you want?

746
01:33:44,864 --> 01:33:48,174
I want Sen.
I want Sen!

747
01:33:49,464 --> 01:33:50,453
Take the gold.

748
01:33:50,544 --> 01:33:54,093
- Are you going to eat me?
- Take it!

749
01:34:03,143 --> 01:34:06,055
If you want to eat me,
eat this fiirst.

750
01:34:07,062 --> 01:34:11,692
I was saving this for my parents,
but I think you'd better have it.

751
01:34:31,421 --> 01:34:32,900
Sen!

752
01:34:35,101 --> 01:34:39,013
Sen, what did you do to me?

753
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:55,729
Enough!
I don't care if he's rich!

754
01:34:56,979 --> 01:34:59,493
This nonsense has gotta stop!

755
01:35:12,218 --> 01:35:13,856
No-Face!

756
01:35:13,938 --> 01:35:16,372
Over here!

757
01:36:00,295 --> 01:36:02,490
I'll get you for this, Sen!

758
01:36:19,853 --> 01:36:21,651
Sen, this way!

759
01:36:37,613 --> 01:36:42,049
- Hey, over here!
- Sen, don't call him over!

760
01:36:45,652 --> 01:36:47,960
I think being in the bathhouse
makes him crazy.

761
01:36:48,051 --> 01:36:49,564
He needs to get out of there.

762
01:36:49,652 --> 01:36:53,246
- Yeah? And go where?
- I don't know.

763
01:36:53,331 --> 01:36:55,083
You don't know?

764
01:36:55,171 --> 01:36:57,559
Great.
Now he's following us.

765
01:37:14,970 --> 01:37:17,085
- You'll have to walk from here.
- Okay.

766
01:37:17,170 --> 01:37:19,205
The station's just down the tracks.

767
01:37:19,289 --> 01:37:21,200
Thanks, Rin.

768
01:37:21,289 --> 01:37:25,282
- You better come back, you hear me?
- I will.

769
01:37:28,409 --> 01:37:33,436
Sen, I'm sorry I called you
a dope before! I take it back!

770
01:37:41,608 --> 01:37:45,725
No-Face, if you put even one scratch
on that girl, you're in big trouble.

771
01:37:49,128 --> 01:37:51,595
There's the station.

772
01:38:01,846 --> 01:38:03,757
Here comes the train.
Come on.

773
01:38:27,805 --> 01:38:30,034
Oh. We'd like to go
to Swamp Bottom, please.

774
01:38:34,563 --> 01:38:36,555
Huh?

775
01:38:36,644 --> 01:38:39,283
- Oh. You wanna come with us?
- Uh-huh.

776
01:38:39,363 --> 01:38:41,798
He'd like to come too, please.

777
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:25,795
Sit here.
Behave yourself, okay?

778
01:41:27,991 --> 01:41:30,142
- Kamajii, wake up.
- Hmm?

779
01:41:31,911 --> 01:41:36,189
- Haku, you're all right.
- I'm fiine. Where is Sen?

780
01:41:36,271 --> 01:41:39,183
Did she go somewhere?
Can you tell me what's going on?

781
01:41:39,270 --> 01:41:42,308
You blacked out, remember?

782
01:41:42,390 --> 01:41:45,188
Yeah, I remember being in darkness.

783
01:41:45,270 --> 01:41:48,307
Then I could hear Sen's voice
calling out my name.

784
01:41:48,390 --> 01:41:50,585
So I followed her voice,
and the next thing I knew...

785
01:41:50,669 --> 01:41:52,581
I was lying here
feeling better than ever.

786
01:41:52,669 --> 01:41:55,662
Pure love.
It broke Zeniba's spell.

787
01:41:55,749 --> 01:41:59,026
Sen left to return the golden seal.

788
01:41:59,109 --> 01:42:01,987
She did it to save you.

789
01:42:05,549 --> 01:42:08,858
This gold doesn't even come close
to covering the damage
that stupid No-Face caused.

790
01:42:08,949 --> 01:42:11,781
Sen didn't get nearly enough.
She'll have to be punished.

791
01:42:11,869 --> 01:42:16,066
- Madam, you see, Sen was the one
that saved us from No-Face.
- Yes, yes.

792
01:42:16,148 --> 01:42:19,902
So what?
This whole mess is her fault.

793
01:42:19,988 --> 01:42:22,548
And now she's run away from here.

794
01:42:22,627 --> 01:42:24,983
She's even abandoned her own parents!

795
01:42:25,067 --> 01:42:28,264
Those pigs must be ready
to eat by now.

796
01:42:28,347 --> 01:42:32,101
- Turn them into bacon.
- Wait a minute.

797
01:42:32,187 --> 01:42:34,098
- Huh?
- Master Haku?

798
01:42:34,187 --> 01:42:36,143
You're still alive?
What is it you want?

799
01:42:38,466 --> 01:42:41,856
You still haven't noticed that something
precious to you has been replaced.

800
01:42:41,946 --> 01:42:45,302
Don't get fresh with me, young man.

801
01:42:45,386 --> 01:42:47,775
Since when do you
talk that way to your master?

802
01:43:39,582 --> 01:43:41,812
My baby!

803
01:43:43,702 --> 01:43:46,262
No!

804
01:43:47,501 --> 01:43:50,096
- My baby!
- It's just dirt.

805
01:43:50,181 --> 01:43:53,218
Where's my baby?

806
01:43:53,301 --> 01:43:56,213
Where are you, sweetie?

807
01:43:58,021 --> 01:44:02,333
Come out! Please, come out!
Where are you?

808
01:44:05,780 --> 01:44:08,771
Sweetie!
Sweetie pie!

809
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:15,968
You!

810
01:44:18,579 --> 01:44:21,651
Where is he?

811
01:44:23,219 --> 01:44:27,734
What did you do with my baby?

812
01:44:27,819 --> 01:44:29,730
He's with your sister.

813
01:44:29,819 --> 01:44:31,854
Zeniba?

814
01:44:52,657 --> 01:44:56,366
Very clever, Haku.
I get it.

815
01:44:56,457 --> 01:44:59,415
You'll get my baby back for me,
but at a price.

816
01:45:00,816 --> 01:45:03,046
So, what do you want?

817
01:45:03,136 --> 01:45:06,606
Tear up Sen's contract.
And then I want you...

818
01:45:06,696 --> 01:45:10,051
to return Sen and her mother
and father back to the human world.

819
01:45:10,136 --> 01:45:12,569
Fine, but on one condition.

820
01:45:12,655 --> 01:45:16,568
I get to give Sen one fiinal test.

821
01:46:03,532 --> 01:46:05,488
I hope this is the right stop.

822
01:46:06,372 --> 01:46:08,601
Let's go.

823
01:46:34,570 --> 01:46:36,400
You can ride on my shoulder
if you're tired.

824
01:47:54,724 --> 01:47:56,635
Come in.

825
01:48:01,083 --> 01:48:03,551
Hello?

826
01:48:05,203 --> 01:48:07,956
Hurry up.
I don't have all day.

827
01:48:08,043 --> 01:48:09,954
Come on.

828
01:48:12,403 --> 01:48:15,678
- So, you all made it.
- Hmm?

829
01:48:15,762 --> 01:48:19,152
Sit down.
I'll make some tea.

830
01:48:25,242 --> 01:48:28,075
Excuse me, ma'am.
Haku stole this from you.

831
01:48:28,161 --> 01:48:29,390
I came to give it back.

832
01:48:32,841 --> 01:48:35,149
Do you have any idea what this is?

833
01:48:35,241 --> 01:48:38,472
Yes. It's the golden seal
you were looking for.

834
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:42,519
I'm here to apologize for Haku.
I'm very sorry.

835
01:48:42,601 --> 01:48:46,434
He sliced me in two, you know,
and I'm still angry.

836
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:50,035
- What?
- What? The protective spell is gone.

837
01:48:51,239 --> 01:48:54,277
I'm sorry. You mean that black slug
that was on your seal?

838
01:48:54,359 --> 01:48:56,271
I think I squashed it with my foot.

839
01:48:56,359 --> 01:48:58,827
Squashed it?

840
01:49:00,999 --> 01:49:03,069
That wasn't my slug.

841
01:49:03,159 --> 01:49:07,311
My sister put that slug into Haku
so she could control him.

842
01:49:07,398 --> 01:49:10,231
You squashed it.

843
01:49:12,318 --> 01:49:14,593
What happened to my spell?

844
01:49:14,678 --> 01:49:17,397
Only love can break it.
Come, now.

845
01:49:18,358 --> 01:49:22,191
Can you please turn these two
back into their normal forms?

846
01:49:22,278 --> 01:49:25,429
The spell on those two
wore off long ago.

847
01:49:25,517 --> 01:49:28,395
Change back if you want.

848
01:49:35,197 --> 01:49:39,189
I don't get along with my sister.
She's so obnoxious.

849
01:49:39,276 --> 01:49:41,631
You saw how tacky her home is.

850
01:49:41,716 --> 01:49:44,788
We're identical twins,
yet exact opposites.

851
01:49:48,796 --> 01:49:51,868
I'm sorry she turned
your parents into pigs.

852
01:49:51,955 --> 01:49:55,425
But there's nothing I can do.
It's just the way things are.

853
01:49:55,515 --> 01:49:58,587
You'll have to help
your parents and Haku on your own.

854
01:49:58,675 --> 01:50:00,666
Use what you remember about them.

855
01:50:00,755 --> 01:50:03,667
What? Can't you please give me
more of a hint than that?

856
01:50:03,754 --> 01:50:07,952
It seems like I met Haku before,
but it was a long time ago.

857
01:50:08,035 --> 01:50:11,470
That's a good start.
Once you've met someone...

858
01:50:11,554 --> 01:50:13,624
you never really forget them.

859
01:50:13,714 --> 01:50:17,309
It just takes a while
for your memories to return.

860
01:50:17,394 --> 01:50:22,786
While you're thinking, the boys and I
are going to make you something.

861
01:50:28,713 --> 01:50:30,624
Come on.
Keep at it.

862
01:50:33,993 --> 01:50:36,553
No-Face, where did you learn
to spin thread?

863
01:50:36,632 --> 01:50:38,190
You're really good at this.

864
01:50:38,272 --> 01:50:41,947
Now let's weave the threads together.

865
01:50:43,752 --> 01:50:46,185
Knit one, pearl two.
Knit one, pearl two.

866
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:47,989
Knit one...
That's right.

867
01:50:48,072 --> 01:50:51,223
Granny, I can't remember
anything at all.

868
01:50:51,311 --> 01:50:55,304
Haku could be dead already,
and I'm just sitting around here.

869
01:50:55,391 --> 01:50:59,304
My mom and dad
could've been eaten for dinner.

870
01:51:00,830 --> 01:51:03,629
Wait just a little bit longer.

871
01:51:03,710 --> 01:51:07,908
There we go.
Use it to tie back your hair.

872
01:51:12,350 --> 01:51:14,067
It's beautiful.

873
01:51:14,150 --> 01:51:19,178
It'll protect you. It's made from
the threads your friends wove together.

874
01:51:19,269 --> 01:51:21,703
Thank you.

875
01:51:30,069 --> 01:51:33,220
What good timing.
We've got another guest.

876
01:51:33,308 --> 01:51:35,220
- Will you let him in?
- Sure.

877
01:51:48,747 --> 01:51:52,625
Haku! Haku.

878
01:51:52,707 --> 01:51:55,937
Thank goodness.
You're alive!

879
01:51:56,027 --> 01:51:58,666
I can't believe it.
How did it happen?

880
01:52:00,787 --> 01:52:03,141
That's love for you.

881
01:52:03,226 --> 01:52:06,536
Look, Granny.
Haku's alive.

882
01:52:06,626 --> 01:52:10,538
Haku, I will forgive you
for stealing my precious seal.

883
01:52:10,626 --> 01:52:14,015
But in return,
you must take care of this girl.

884
01:52:14,105 --> 01:52:17,734
Okay, you two,
it's time to go home.

885
01:52:17,825 --> 01:52:20,213
Come back soon.

886
01:52:20,305 --> 01:52:22,978
No-Face, why don't you stay with me?

887
01:52:23,065 --> 01:52:26,057
I could use a good helper.

888
01:52:27,144 --> 01:52:30,853
Granny! Thank you so much.
I'll miss you.

889
01:52:30,944 --> 01:52:34,380
Don't worry.
You'll be all right, Sen.

890
01:52:34,464 --> 01:52:37,694
I want you to know my real name.
It's Chihiro.

891
01:52:37,784 --> 01:52:40,251
Chihiro.
What a pretty name.

892
01:52:40,344 --> 01:52:43,097
- You take good care of it.
- I will.

893
01:52:43,183 --> 01:52:46,061
- Off you go.
- Okay. Bye.

894
01:52:46,143 --> 01:52:50,534
Granny, take care!
Thanks for everything!

895
01:53:38,620 --> 01:53:42,692
Haku, listen. I just remembered
something from a long time ago.

896
01:53:42,779 --> 01:53:45,691
I think it may help you.
Once, when I was little...

897
01:53:45,779 --> 01:53:48,054
I dropped my shoe into a river.

898
01:53:48,138 --> 01:53:51,255
And when I tried to get it back,
I fell in.

899
01:53:51,339 --> 01:53:55,297
I thought I'd drown,
but the water carried me to shore.

900
01:53:55,378 --> 01:53:58,050
It fiinally came back to me.

901
01:53:58,138 --> 01:54:01,130
The river's name was
the Kohaku River.

902
01:54:01,217 --> 01:54:05,096
I think that was you,
and your real name is Kohaku River!

903
01:54:26,136 --> 01:54:28,808
You did it, Chihiro!
I remember.

904
01:54:28,896 --> 01:54:31,046
I was the spirit
of the Kohaku River.

905
01:54:31,135 --> 01:54:34,844
- A river spirit?
- My name is the Kohaku River.

906
01:54:34,935 --> 01:54:37,529
They fiilled in that river.
It's all apartments now.

907
01:54:37,615 --> 01:54:40,448
That must be why I can't
fiind my way home, Chihiro.

908
01:54:40,534 --> 01:54:44,130
I remember you falling into my river,
and I remember your little pink shoe.

909
01:54:44,214 --> 01:54:47,445
So you're the one who carried me
back into shallow water.

910
01:54:47,534 --> 01:54:50,810
You saved me.
I knew you were good.

911
01:55:23,612 --> 01:55:26,001
Hey, there they are!

912
01:55:38,211 --> 01:55:41,327
I see you failed
to bring my baby back.

913
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:46,159
- Mama!
- My baby!

914
01:55:46,250 --> 01:55:50,448
Are you traumatized?
Did they do terrible things to you?

915
01:55:50,530 --> 01:55:53,680
You're standing all by yourself.
When did that happen?

916
01:55:53,770 --> 01:55:56,967
Don't forget your promise.
You must return...

917
01:55:57,049 --> 01:55:59,438
Chihiro and her parents
to the human world.

918
01:56:00,849 --> 01:56:02,840
Not so fast, Haku.

919
01:56:02,929 --> 01:56:06,080
I get to give Sen one fiinal test.

920
01:56:06,169 --> 01:56:08,683
- Shut up!
- Stop it, Mama.

921
01:56:08,768 --> 01:56:10,679
Leave her alone.

922
01:56:10,768 --> 01:56:12,838
Sen and I had a really good time.

923
01:56:13,587 --> 01:56:16,419
But a deal is a deal, sweetie.

924
01:56:16,506 --> 01:56:18,701
I have to give Sen one fiinal test.

925
01:56:18,785 --> 01:56:22,062
If you make Sen cry,
I won't like you any more.

926
01:56:22,145 --> 01:56:26,582
- But...
- Hey, Granny!
- Granny?

927
01:56:26,665 --> 01:56:29,054
You're right.
A deal's a deal.

928
01:56:40,464 --> 01:56:43,262
Okay, I'm ready.
I'll take your test.

929
01:56:43,344 --> 01:56:46,973
You've got guts.
I've got your contract right here.

930
01:56:47,064 --> 01:56:51,296
Come this way.
This'll only take a minute.

931
01:56:51,384 --> 01:56:53,738
Don't worry.

932
01:56:57,103 --> 01:57:00,857
See if you can tell which of
these pigs is your mother and father.

933
01:57:10,502 --> 01:57:14,461
You get one try. If you get it right,
you can all go home.

934
01:57:24,781 --> 01:57:27,818
Huh?
There must be a mistake.

935
01:57:27,901 --> 01:57:29,971
None of these pigs
are my mom or dad.

936
01:57:30,061 --> 01:57:33,735
None of them?
Is that really your answer?

937
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:42,412
Oh, you got it!

938
01:57:42,500 --> 01:57:45,014
Sen! Yes!

939
01:57:49,060 --> 01:57:51,892
- Thank you, everyone.
- All right, you win.

940
01:57:51,979 --> 01:57:53,936
Get out of my sight.

941
01:57:54,019 --> 01:57:58,011
Thanks for everything, Granny.
Goodbye!

942
01:57:58,099 --> 01:58:01,010
- Goodbye!
- Thank you!

943
01:58:01,099 --> 01:58:03,054
- Haku!
- Let's go!

944
01:58:03,138 --> 01:58:06,335
- Where are my mom and dad?
- They're there now,
and they're looking for you.

945
01:58:13,938 --> 01:58:16,896
- There's no water here.
- But I can't go any farther.

946
01:58:16,977 --> 01:58:20,333
Just go back the way you came. You'll
be fiine. But you have to promise...

947
01:58:20,417 --> 01:58:22,885
not to look back, not until
you've passed through the tunnel.

948
01:58:22,977 --> 01:58:25,127
What about you?
What'll you do?

949
01:58:25,217 --> 01:58:28,572
Don't worry. I'll go back
and have a talk with Yubaba.

950
01:58:28,657 --> 01:58:31,045
I'll tell her I'm going
to quit being her apprentice.

951
01:58:31,136 --> 01:58:33,604
I'm fiine.
I got my name back.

952
01:58:33,696 --> 01:58:36,051
- Will we meet again sometime?
- Sure we will.

953
01:58:36,136 --> 01:58:37,967
- Promise?
- Promise.

954
01:58:38,056 --> 01:58:40,092
Now go, and don't look back.

955
01:59:02,774 --> 01:59:04,526
Chihiro!

956
01:59:04,614 --> 01:59:07,526
Where have you been?
Hurry up!

957
01:59:11,214 --> 01:59:14,603
- Mom, Dad!
- You shouldn't run off like that, honey.

958
01:59:14,693 --> 01:59:16,604
You could get in big trouble.

959
01:59:16,693 --> 01:59:19,048
Are you guys sure you're all right?

960
01:59:19,133 --> 01:59:22,045
Let's go.
I don't wanna miss the movers.

961
01:59:32,652 --> 01:59:34,563
Chihiro, hurry up.

962
01:59:43,131 --> 01:59:45,201
Everybody, watch your step.

963
01:59:45,291 --> 01:59:48,681
Chihiro, don't cling like that.
You'll make me trip.

964
02:00:01,090 --> 02:00:03,684
We made it.
Hey, what happened?

965
02:00:03,770 --> 02:00:05,680
What is it?

966
02:00:05,770 --> 02:00:08,442
Look at that.

967
02:00:09,729 --> 02:00:13,563
- It's all dusty inside too.
- Is this someone's idea of a joke?

968
02:00:13,649 --> 02:00:16,447
- Looks like it.
- I told you we shouldn't have stopped.

969
02:00:22,408 --> 02:00:26,083
Come on, Chihiro.
Let's get to our new home.

970
02:00:26,168 --> 02:00:28,124
You're not scared, are you?

971
02:00:28,208 --> 02:00:31,006
Don't be afraid, honey.
Everything's gonna be okay.
