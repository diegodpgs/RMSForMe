1
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,900
A soldier does not speak...

2
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,900
...until spoken to by a superior officer.

3
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,300
A soldier shows no mercy.

4
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,500
Mercy is weakness.

5
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,500
Weakness is death.

6
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,700
The Forces are his family.

7
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,900
He is most happy...

8
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,000
...when following orders.

9
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,500
A soldier lives to kill.

10
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,500
A soldier needs no friend or family.

11
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,600
War is his friend.

12
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,000
The Forces are his family.

13
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,900
Sir, Colonel Mekum has
his new batch unpacked.

14
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,300
l think he wants to show them off.

15
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,100
Well....

16
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,900
-They're pretty.
-What's so hot about them?

17
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,200
They're very much improved, Captain.

18
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,800
Colonel Mekum from HQ.
He's their commanding officer.

19
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,700
Sir.

20
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,500
'"lmproved.'" How?

21
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,500
ln every way possible.

22
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,000
You see, your old ones,
they're selected at birth.

23
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,800
With my new ones,
we're talking recombination.

24
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,700
They're practically manufactured,
using DNA profiles...

25
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,800
...and some manipulation.

26
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,200
More endurance, quicker responses...

27
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,600
...better hand-eye...

28
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
...improved technical training.

29
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,700
lt's a whole different standard.

30
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,500
My daddy was in maintenance...

31
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,600
...and he had a saying:

32
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,900
'"lf it ain't broke, don't fix it.'"

33
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,200
'"Maintenance.'"

34
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,800
l'm afraid l don't get your point.

35
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,500
The veterans you see...

36
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,400
...standing before you here
have been through all kinds of heavy shit.

37
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,300
They've always got the job done.

38
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,200
Your new soldiers, these hotshots,
how much action have they seen?

39
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,400
And are they battle-tested?

40
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,300
How about a few tests,
just to get you on board?

41
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,900
Make you a believer.

42
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,100
Ninety-nine percent. That's...

43
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,800
...very good.

44
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,700
Seen enough, Captain?

45
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,600
What about endurance?

46
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,800
Caine 607, forward.

47
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,400
Sir!

48
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,800
Fifteen miles, 607, on the run.

49
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,700
You've got 60 minutes.

50
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,700
Go.

51
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,900
My man left exactly...

52
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,900
...20 minutes after yours.

53
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,700
Make a note of that.

54
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,300
Age is a factor. But the real factor
is the training program.

55
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,400
Especially the psychological.

56
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,300
The mind controls the body, after all.

57
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,500
And we're doing such wonderful things
with the mind.

58
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,500
Sir!

59
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,300
At ease, Soldier.

60
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,800
What is the price of all that speed?

61
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,700
ls your soldier tired?

62
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,100
'"Tired?'"

63
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,800
Todd ran the pace
he's been taught to run...

64
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
...and he's still strong.

65
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
Send him up the chain, Rube.

66
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,600
Soldier! Up the chain!

67
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Sir!

68
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,300
607, on the double, up the chain.

69
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,300
Sir!

70
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,400
What about spirit?

71
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,900
l believe you mean AQ, Captain.
Aggressive qualities.

72
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,900
Much higher.

73
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,300
Much better.

74
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,200
What if they fought?

75
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,500
You mean up there?

76
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,000
Go ahead, Rube.

77
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,300
Tell Todd to take him.

78
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,200
No.

79
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,300
'"No?'"

80
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,000
Not fair.

81
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,700
No contest.

82
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,200
Send two more of your old ones up.

83
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,600
Romero, Goines, up the chain!

84
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,400
Get him, men!

85
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,700
Get down here.

86
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,700
Get down here!

87
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,400
Get your ass down here on the double!

88
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,000
Come on, double up! Down, down!

89
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,200
Sir!

90
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,500
Look at you.

91
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,700
Do you know how much it cost
to breed you, you big moron?

92
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,800
To train you?

93
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,800
To feed you?

94
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,700
What good is this man now?

95
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,600
He's got no depth perception!

96
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,800
All he can do is walk, point,
and take the first hit!

97
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,200
-What about the bodies?
-Waste disposal.

98
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,200
Fall in.

99
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,400
Sir!

100
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,300
Todd was our best man.

101
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,100
You still don't get it, do you?

102
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,800
Your men...

103
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,100
...are obsolete.

104
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,900
You'll write this up as a training accident...

105
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,000
...and you'll make sure these bodies
get dumped a long way from here.

106
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,700
We don't want any unnecessary questions.

107
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,900
Someone, please...

108
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,000
...let us know what's going on!

109
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,600
Hawkins!

110
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,400
Give us something! Anything!

111
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,100
Quiet, please!

112
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Quiet!

113
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,900
How many of them are there?

114
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,500
There is one man...

115
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,800
...unarmed.

116
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,400
How could there only be one?
How could he get here?

117
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,400
He was unconscious when we found him.

118
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,100
We couldn't ask him anything.

119
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,600
Hang on. Jimmy's back!

120
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,200
There's nothing out there.

121
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,300
l couldn't see nobody.

122
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,200
Couldn't see no vehicles, no ship, nothing.

123
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,700
Plus the wind's up again real strong.

124
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,400
Everybody, calm down.

125
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,200
We have an injured man among us.

126
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,800
We all want to do the decent thing.

127
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,900
The decent thing is to help him.

128
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,800
Sandra, Mace's wife,
is looking after him now.

129
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,000
Now, l'd like a vote of support
from all of you.

130
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
You keep an eye on him, Mace.

131
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
Watch him.

132
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,300
There are words on his shoulder.

133
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,900
'"Tannhauser Gate...

134
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,400
'"...Argentine Sector...

135
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,100
'"...Shanghai 2012.'"

136
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,100
Sandra, the Tannhauser Gate was a battle.

137
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,200
He's a soldier.

138
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,900
Where's Nathan?

139
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,100
Tiger!

140
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,900
Nathan, there's another tiger.

141
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,700
Help, help, help!

142
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,700
We're sorry if we woke you.

143
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Just playing with the boy.

144
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Sergeant...

145
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
...l made something for you.

146
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,800
lt's to help you walk, you see?

147
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,800
lsn't it? Like this.

148
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,700
See?

149
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,400
Here you go.

150
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,600
l don't see how you cannot remember
how you got here, Sergeant.

151
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,600
You're not a deserter, are you, Sergeant?

152
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,900
No, sir.

153
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,700
Why aren't you with your unit?

154
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,900
Come on, Slade, let the man eat.

155
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,200
lt's not an unreasonable question.

156
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,900
How about it, Sergeant?

157
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,000
l was replaced.

158
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,300
'"Replaced?'"

159
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,600
By a better soldier, sir.

160
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:25,100
When we left Earth 12 years ago,
we never thought we'd end up here.

161
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,200
When we crashed, a lot of people died.

162
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:33,100
A few years later, when the dumpers
started coming and dropping stuff...

163
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,900
...people tried to get their attention
with fires and explosions.

164
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,700
But it didn't work.

165
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,100
They must be unmanned or...

166
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,300
...maybe they just don't care.

167
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,800
So, we had to forget about a better life
on the Trinity Moons.

168
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,800
One good thing though:

169
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,400
Nobody bothers us.

170
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,500
Who'd fight for a godforsaken place
like this?

171
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,900
But...

172
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,900
...l guess you like the fighting.

173
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,600
You must.

174
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,700
You're...

175
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,300
...a soldier.

176
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,300
The biannual security sweep.

177
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,900
We'll be patrolling the Arcadia system.

178
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,800
We're going to set up
unmanned monitoring stations here...

179
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,800
...here, here, here.

180
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,000
Now, we send the new soldiers out
on patrol.

181
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,600
Routine stuff as you say, Captain,
but good experience and...

182
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,700
...l'll have a chance to see them
in a non-training environment.

183
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,100
You're coming?

184
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,200
Yes, Captain.

185
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,600
l want to observe these men at close hand.

186
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,600
Well, what about opposition?

187
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,400
lt's all deserted.
We're just confirming that.

188
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,500
But say we do encounter activity.

189
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Miners, refugees of some sort?

190
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,600
Well, we won't.

191
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,400
lf so, they'll be officially classifiable
as hostiles.

192
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,300
Just by being there?

193
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,300
We don't want paperwork,
and we certainly don't want passengers.

194
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,500
Understood?

195
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,100
You have to watch out for those.

196
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,900
They probably wouldn't kill someone
your size.

197
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,800
But someone smaller, like me...

198
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,300
...or Nathan....

199
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,200
He was bitten once...

200
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,900
...and he almost died.

201
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,100
He was sick for a long time.

202
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,600
That's why he can't speak.

203
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,000
Here.

204
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,300
You try one.

205
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,100
Here.

206
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,700
Everything we own, Sergeant,
everything in the entire village...

207
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,400
...we've had to salvage from out here.

208
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,200
-You're all set, Jimmy.
-Back in a minute.

209
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,100
Whatever looks useful,
if we can get a chain to it...

210
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,100
...we're going to go for it.

211
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,100
You hear that?

212
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,500
That means she's really close.

213
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,100
She's going to blow!

214
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,600
On my way!

215
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,500
Line up!

216
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,700
Come on, Jimmy!

217
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,800
Jimmy, come on!

218
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,500
Come on!

219
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,400
Hurry up! Let's go!

220
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,300
-Mace!
-Give me your hand!

221
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,900
-Too strong!
-Stretch!

222
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,500
Reach, Jimmy!

223
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,900
l can't reach!

224
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,200
Help!

225
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,400
Help!

226
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,900
Pull!

227
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,000
Mace! Help!

228
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,800
Pull!

229
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,400
All right, we got him!

230
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,300
You were almost bacon on that one.

231
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,400
Thank you.

232
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,800
They're dumpers.

233
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,900
They come every 20 or 30 days.

234
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,300
Sergeant, the gun. Please.

235
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,500
Thanks, partner!

236
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,100
Them no-goods would've let me
blow away.

237
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,800
Sergeant Todd...

238
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,000
...what's it like?

239
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,500
What's it like being a soldier?

240
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,500
What do you think about?

241
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
You must think about something.

242
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,200
What about feelings, then?

243
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,200
You must feel something.

244
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,800
Fear.

245
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,700
'"Fear?'"

246
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,300
Fear and discipline.

247
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,200
Now?

248
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,800
Always.

249
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,900
Oh, my God.

250
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,300
Merry Christmas!

251
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,800
Merry Christmas, Sergeant!

252
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,200
l was going to give this scarf to him
last night, but he disappeared.

253
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,900
lt's beautiful, Jimmy.

254
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,800
He'll love it.

255
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,200
Well, he saved my life out there.
l guess Mace told you.

256
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,600
You should give it to him yourself.

257
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,500
He's in the meeting room.

258
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,700
He's doing exercises.

259
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,300
Children....

260
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,200
You're supposed to be doing your lessons.

261
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,800
Scarf!

262
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,000
People are upset about him.

263
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,100
There's going to be a meeting.

264
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,800
He's not fully recovered.

265
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,500
That's what scares people.

266
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,700
He gets stronger every day.

267
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,100
Are you scared of him, Mace?

268
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,400
Yes.

269
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,500
l've never been afraid of anyone before.
Not like this.

270
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,900
l feel he could break me in half
with no real effort and no real...

271
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,200
...feeling.

272
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,400
He is most happy when following orders.

273
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,400
A soldier shows no mercy.

274
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,300
Mercy is weakness.

275
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,300
Weakness is death.

276
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,300
A soldier needs no friend or family.

277
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,800
War is his friend.

278
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,900
The Forces are his family.

279
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,600
What the hell do you think you're doing?

280
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,900
You could have killed him.

281
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:43,000
No one here has any animosity
towards you, Sergeant.

282
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,100
None of us here is your enemy.

283
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,300
Furthermore, we respect your qualities.

284
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,800
We have no doubt that you are a very...

285
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,600
...very good soldier.

286
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,700
But because of your training...

287
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:58,400
...we don't think you'll ever be able
to function in a group like this:

288
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,400
A community of families...

289
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,800
...of children...

290
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,100
...where the ability to fight is not
the sole purpose of existence.

291
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,700
You're different from us, Sergeant.

292
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,700
We don't hate you for that.

293
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,900
But we have agreed
that to try to include you...

294
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:17,300
...would pose an intolerable risk
to the community itself.

295
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,100
We'll give you any tools you need:

296
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:26,200
Some warm clothing,
some boots, a good knife.

297
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,400
Sergeant, you're our friend.

298
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,600
lt's just....

299
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,000
lf you need us, you can ask us for help.

300
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:50,000
Command, we are on course
for Arcadia 234.

301
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:58,000
-How will you find him?
-He'll have stayed close to the wire.

302
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
What'll l tell the council?

303
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,700
We all voted.

304
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,100
We voted wrong.

305
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,500
We were wrong.

306
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,500
We made a mistake.

307
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,100
We're sorry.

308
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,600
lt's some kind of landing party.

309
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,400
Hey! Over here!

310
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,000
Stay with me, sir.

311
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,700
All units stand by
for Arcadia 234 security sweep.

312
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,000
Any trespassers will be considered hostile.

313
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,000
Wait! What's going on?

314
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,900
Somebody's landing!
Jimmy Pig spotted a ship!

315
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:44,700
Two hostiles at 12:00.

316
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,800
Hostiles eliminated.

317
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,900
lt's no good.

318
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,800
l've lost too much blood.

319
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,400
Why?

320
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,900
Was it a mistake?

321
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,300
Oh, God, no!

322
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,800
Not Sandra.

323
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,300
Please...

324
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,300
...not Nathan.

325
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,100
Please....

326
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,400
People!

327
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,200
They spotted people!

328
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,900
Two civilians, unarmed.

329
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:26,300
They killed both of them. They spotted
smoke from some sort of camp.

330
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,000
Jesus Christ! A camp?

331
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,100
Excellent.

332
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:31,500
This'll be very good experience
for the men.

333
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,000
Let's see how they do.

334
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,600
Civilians need to be protected.

335
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:38,800
Whoever they are, they don't belong there.
Officially, they're hostiles.

336
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:50,000
Three-man fire team only.

337
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,100
Prepare to deploy.

338
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:56,800
Everybody!

339
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,300
Calm down!

340
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,300
Calm down.

341
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,600
l'm going to go out and talk to them.

342
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,900
Those of you with weapons,
prepare to defend us.

343
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,600
God, help us.

344
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,900
Three-man fire team in position.

345
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,200
Crawler to fire team.

346
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:06,800
Engage.

347
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:12,800
Report from Crawler 1 :
Everything under control.

348
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,000
-ls there resistance?
-lneffectual.

349
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,100
Three men are going in to clean them out.

350
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:19,600
Caine's ordered the rest to hold back.

351
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,900
Sounds reckless. Three against 50.

352
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,100
l can tell these men
have no combat experience.

353
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,600
The old ones, the veterans...

354
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:30,700
...they would've called for support,
just in case.

355
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,300
Speaking of the old ones...

356
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:36,200
...why don't we have Riley and his crew
put up the monitoring unit?

357
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,800
Atten-hut!

358
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:44,400
Sir.

359
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,700
Riley?

360
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:49,500
-Will we be issued weapons, sir?
-No, Riley.

361
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,300
Only soldiers get weapons.

362
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,700
Yes, sir!

363
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:58,800
You don't even have
to salute anymore, Riley.

364
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,200
Now!

365
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:05,100
You need any help, partner?

366
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:23,400
Riley and team deploying monitor unit.

367
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:32,800
Don't panic!

368
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:35,300
Up the stairs. Come on.

369
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,000
Will, take him.

370
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:46,500
Go, go!

371
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,200
Get inside the bedroom!

372
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,300
Come in, Unit 703.

373
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,000
Unit 703, do you copy?

374
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,100
A growl?

375
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:10,800
He heard a growl?

376
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:11,800
Well...

377
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:15,000
...he didn't say the word '"growl.'"
He said, '"a throat noise.'"

378
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,300
But l asked him to imitate it,
and it sounded like a growl to me.

379
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:26,000
We're obviously up against
a significant military presence here.

380
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:30,200
Well, let's send in the rest of the men.

381
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,600
Absolutely not.

382
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:36,100
Those bastards are just waiting
for us in there.

383
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:37,700
No.

384
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:39,800
We don't fall for an ambush.

385
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,100
Colonel...

386
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,000
...my daddy always said:

387
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,700
'"When you want to insert a nail
into a piece of wood...

388
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:48,200
'"...you don't do anything
fancy or glamorous.

389
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:51,700
'"Just take the damn hammer
and hit the son of a bitch till it's in.'"

390
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:54,800
What exactly does that crap mean
in English, Captain?

391
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,700
Withdraw your men.

392
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,800
Load them up with heavy artillery.

393
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:03,500
At night, they'll go back and pound
that place with mortars, rockets, cannons...

394
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,500
...everything we got...

395
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:07,800
...from a safe distance.

396
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,700
lt ain't fancy...

397
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:13,500
...but it will sure take care
of your hostile military force.

398
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,700
All right, do it. Withdraw the men.

399
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:28,600
Push really hard, okay? Hard.

400
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:11,000
They killed him, didn't they?

401
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,800
How do you know they'll be back?

402
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:45,000
Because they're soldiers, sir...

403
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,400
...like me.

404
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:50,800
-Why are they doing this?
-They're obeying orders, sir.

405
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:52,800
lt's their duty.

406
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,900
Do you know how many they'll be?

407
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:57,400
Seventeen more, sir.

408
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,900
You can't fight 17 on your own.

409
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:03,500
You have to organize us.
We're not cowards.

410
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:06,500
We'll do as you tell us.

411
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,300
-We'll fight.
-No.

412
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:13,200
Why not?

413
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:15,900
Soldiers deserve soldiers, sir.

414
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:18,200
But one soldier...

415
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:21,300
...against 17?

416
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,700
What are you going to do?

417
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:30,400
l'm going to kill them all, sir.

418
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,100
Crawlers 1 and 2...

419
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,000
...proceed to settlement...

420
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
...and commence bombardment.

421
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,700
Crawler 1, we are red.

422
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:15,000
We are red.

423
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,300
Crawler 2 to Crawler 1 :

424
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,100
-Report.
-Crawler 2, we are two down.

425
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:21,800
Responding to sniper activity.

426
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,900
Crawlers 1 and 2, split up.

427
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:26,500
Crawler 1, locate and neutralize the sniper.

428
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:27,600
Caine 607...

429
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,100
...proceed to the settlement
and commence bombardment.

430
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:32,500
Roger, 1 . We're proceeding to target.

431
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:49,600
Crawler 1, deploying ground forces.

432
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:43,200
All units...

433
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:44,500
...report.

434
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,800
438, negative.

435
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,800
515, negative.

436
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:52,900
523, negative.

437
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:02,900
Squad 1, to your 9:00!
Squad 2, stand by with covering fire!

438
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:19,400
Enemy sniper at 12:00!

439
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:25,000
Sniper located!

440
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:04,200
-Ambush!
-Retreat!

441
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:04,800
l think we have to assume
that the missing men are down.

442
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:08,300
Maybe you should've made them smart
instead of fast.

443
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:19,000
Squad 1, do you copy?

444
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,500
Squad 2, do you copy?

445
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:24,000
Squad 3, do you copy?

446
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,300
607 to Command.
1.5 clicks from settlement.

447
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:30,200
Will engage enemy in two minutes.

448
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:32,600
Roger, 607.

449
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,000
Crawler 1 to Command.

450
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,900
We have lost radio contact
with all ground units.

451
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:44,400
We are still searching for the sniper.

452
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:57,100
Crawler 2 to Crawler 1 . Come in, 1 .

453
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:58,200
One.

454
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:01,900
Two to one. Take your port to our 9:00
and commence firing.

455
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:05,300
Affirmative, 2.
Port to 9:00 and commence firing.

456
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,700
Crawler 2 to Crawler 1 .

457
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:26,800
Again, proceed to Port 9:00.

458
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:28,500
Affirmative.

459
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,200
Proceed to Port 9:00.

460
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,100
Where's my father?

461
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,300
Two to one.

462
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,200
You're still on 12:00. Correct: 9:00.

463
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,500
Affirmative, 2.

464
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:05,100
Crawler 1!

465
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:07,900
You're on a collision course with me!

466
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:09,500
Affirmative, 2.

467
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,000
Crawler 1, do you copy?

468
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,700
Crawler 2, do you copy?

469
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:59,300
Are any ofyou men out there?

470
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:02,200
Can any ofyou men hear me?

471
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:05,400
Your men...

472
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:07,200
...are obsolete.

473
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:13,400
-Try Number 1 .
-l tried Number 1 ! l can't get either!

474
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:16,500
This is bad. We don't know
what we're up against. How many?

475
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:19,000
They couldn't get figures on enemy troops.

476
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,800
We're sitting ducks.
There could be a few divisions out there.

477
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:24,500
We don't even have the weapons
to arm the old soldiers.

478
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:26,000
ls that a recrimination?

479
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,400
Because if it is,
l will have you court-martialed.

480
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:31,200
-No, sir.
-All right, don't panic. Don't panic.

481
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,100
l am not panicking!

482
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:19,900
Captain...

483
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,200
...you must have some
of those new DX-57s on board.

484
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:25,000
Planet killers, you mean.

485
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,400
We carry 15.

486
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,900
One's enough.

487
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:31,800
We set it on a short fuse
and we get out of here.

488
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,000
Boom. We win.

489
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:49,200
Brave. lt means that even
when you're scared...

490
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:51,600
...you control your emotions.

491
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,500
You make the fear be really small and tiny.

492
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:56,800
Oh, no!

493
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:44,500
We should go, sir.

494
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:06,300
Take him.

495
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Go back.

496
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:21,600
Go back! Go back!

497
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,300
Right horizontal.

498
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:09,400
Roger. Right horizontal checks green.

499
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:10,900
What are we waiting for?

500
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:12,100
Give us a go.

501
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:14,600
We'll give Riley and his men

Losing men in combat is one thing,
abandoning them--

506
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:30,500
l'm not going to die
because of your pompous bullshit.

Come on! On the double! Let's go!

Close up the lower hatch.

513
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,600
Punch up your port power cluster.

514
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:12,700
What was that?

515
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:14,000
What was what?

516
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:21,600
Get off of me!

517
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:26,100
Fucking morons! Get your hands off me!
Ten minutes to go, understand?

518
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,500
You're killing yourselves!

519
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:30,600
What are you doing?

520
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:42,300
You?

521

Don't leave us!

525
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:52,000
We must get out of here!

526
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,300
Colonel!

527

Aye-aye, sir.
