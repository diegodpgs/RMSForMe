1
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,359
Henslowe, do you know what happens
to a man who doesn’t pay his debts?

2
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:59,197
His boots catch fire!

3
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:02,480
Why do you howl...

4
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:05,080
when it is I who am bitten?

5
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:07,999
-What am I, Mr. Lambert?
-Bitten, Mr. Fennyman.

6
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,880
How badly bitten, Mr. Frees?

7
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:12,840
12 pounds, 1 schilling and 4 pence,
Mr. Fennyman, including interest.

8
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,719
-Aaah! I can pay you!
-When?

9
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,800
Two weeks! Three weeks at the most!
Oh, for pity’s sake!

10
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:19,961
Take them out.

11
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,881
Where will you find...

12
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:23,879
16 pounds, 5 schillings and 9 pence...

13
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,800
Including interest, in 3 weeks?

14
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:28,480
-I have a wonderful new play.
-Put them back in.

15
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,400
-It’s a comedy!
-Cut off his nose.

16
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:33,211
It’s a new comedy
by William Shakespeare.

17
00:02:34,841 --> 00:02:36,761
-And his ears.
-And a share!

18
00:02:36,762 --> 00:02:38,958
We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!

19
00:02:40,522 --> 00:02:42,082
Partners?

20
00:02:45,802 --> 00:02:48,122
It’s a crowd-tickler.

21
00:02:48,203 --> 00:02:51,395
Mistaken identities.
Shipwreck. Pirate king.

22
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:54,441
-A bit with a dog, and love triumphant.
-I think I've seen it.

23
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:56,123
I didn’t like it.

24
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:59,763
-But this time it is by Shakespeare.
-What’s it called?

25
00:02:59,844 --> 00:03:02,523
"Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate’s Daughter".

26
00:03:02,603 --> 00:03:04,603
Good title.

27
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,963
A play takes time.
Find the actors, rehearsals.

28
00:03:07,964 --> 00:03:10,243
Let’s say we open in 2 weeks.

29
00:03:10,363 --> 00:03:12,763
That’s, what, 500 groundlings
at tuppence a head.

30
00:03:12,764 --> 00:03:16,284
In addition, 400 backsides at
three pence, a penny extra for cushions.

31
00:03:16,324 --> 00:03:18,204
Call it, uh, 200 cushions.

32
00:03:18,283 --> 00:03:21,964
Say two performances for safety.
How much is that, Mr. Frees?

33
00:03:21,965 --> 00:03:24,965
-20 pounds to the penny, Mr. Fennyman.
-Correct.

34
00:03:25,044 --> 00:03:28,044
-But I have to pay the actors and the author.
-Share of the profits.

35
00:03:28,045 --> 00:03:30,444
-There’s never any...
-Of course not.

36
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:34,819
Mr. Fennyman, I think you
might have hit upon something.

37
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:36,641
Sign there.

38
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:44,286
So, "Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate’s Daughter".

39
00:03:45,207 --> 00:03:46,207
Almost finished?

40
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:49,646
Without doubt he’s completing
it at this very moment.

41
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:29,268
<b><u>Subtitles by ADONI@</u></b>

42
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,289
Will. Will!

43
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,769
Where is my play?

44
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,969
Tell me you have it nearly done.
Tell me you have it started.

45
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,290
<i>Doubt that the stars are fire,
doubt that the sun doth move.</i>

46
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,976
No, no, we haven’t the time.
Talk prose.

47
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,850
Where is my play?

48
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:04,449
-It is all locked safe in here.
-God be praised.

49
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,251
Locked?

50
00:05:06,331 --> 00:05:09,610
-As soon as I find my muse.
-Who is she this time?

51
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:11,450
She is always Aphrodite.

52
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:14,250
Aphrodite Baggot, who does it
behind the Dog and Trumpet?

53
00:05:14,251 --> 00:05:17,211
Henslowe, you have no soul...

54
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:20,891
so how can you understand
the emptiness that seeks a soul mate?

55
00:05:20,892 --> 00:05:22,731
Ow! Will!

56
00:05:22,812 --> 00:05:25,612
I am a dead man and buggered to boot.

57
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,091
My theater is closed by the plague
these twelve weeks.

58
00:05:28,131 --> 00:05:30,971
My actors are forced to tour
the inn yards of England...

59
00:05:30,972 --> 00:05:33,851
while Mr. Burbage and the Chamberlain’s
Men are invited to court...

60
00:05:33,852 --> 00:05:36,732
and receive 10 pounds
to play your piece...

61
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:39,611
written for my theater,
by my writer, at my risk...

62
00:05:39,612 --> 00:05:41,532
when you were green and grateful.

63
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:44,412
-What piece? "Richard Crookback"?
-No! It's comedy they want.

64
00:05:44,413 --> 00:05:46,253
Like "Romeo and Ethel".

65
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:49,212
-Who wrote that?
-Nobody. You were writing it for me.

66
00:05:49,213 --> 00:05:52,093
-I gave you 3 pound a month since.
-Half what you owe me.

67
00:05:52,094 --> 00:05:54,412
I'm still due for
"One Gentleman of Verona".

68
00:05:54,413 --> 00:05:57,773
What is money to you and me?
I, your patron, you, my word Wright.

69
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,614
When the plague lifts...

70
00:05:59,695 --> 00:06:02,573
Burbage will have a new play
by Christopher Marlowe for the "Curtain".

71
00:06:02,574 --> 00:06:04,494
-I will have nothing for the "Rose".
-Mr. Henslowe.

72
00:06:04,495 --> 00:06:07,069
-Will you lend me 50 pounds?
-50 pounds? What for?

73
00:06:07,111 --> 00:06:09,294
Burbage offers me a partnership
in the Chamberlain’s Men.

74
00:06:09,295 --> 00:06:13,117
For 50 pounds, my days
as a hired player are over.

75
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:15,896
Oh, cut out my heart.
Throw my liver to the dogs.

76
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,815
No, then?

77
00:06:17,895 --> 00:06:20,735
Theaters are handmaidens of the devil!

78
00:06:20,816 --> 00:06:25,254
The players breed lewdness in your wives
and wickedness in your children!

79
00:06:25,255 --> 00:06:29,655
And the "Rose" smells
thusly rank by any name!

80
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:34,175
I say, a plague on both their houses!

81
00:06:34,256 --> 00:06:36,096
Where are you going?

82
00:06:36,177 --> 00:06:38,176
My weekly confession.

83
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:45,937
Words, words, words.

84
00:06:46,016 --> 00:06:48,337
Once, I had the gift.

85
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:52,257
I could make love out of words
as a potter makes cups of clay.

86
00:06:52,258 --> 00:06:54,176
Love that overthrows empires.

87
00:06:54,177 --> 00:06:57,536
Love that binds two hearts together,
come hellfire and brimstone.

88
00:06:57,537 --> 00:07:01,298
For sixpence a line,
I could cause a riot in a nunnery.

89
00:07:01,377 --> 00:07:04,658
-But now...
-And yet you tell me you lie with women.

90
00:07:06,258 --> 00:07:08,898
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe...

91
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:12,937
Rosaline, Borage’s seamstress,
Aphrodite, who does it behind...

92
00:07:12,938 --> 00:07:15,618
Yes, now and again.
What of it?

93
00:07:15,738 --> 00:07:17,301
I have lost my gift.

94
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:19,659
I am here to help you.

95
00:07:19,698 --> 00:07:22,059
Tell me, in your own words.

96
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,339
It’s as if my quill is broken...

97
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:33,179
as if the organ of my imagination
has dried up...

98
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:36,779
as if the proud tower
of my genius has collapsed.

99
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,295
Interesting.

100
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,419
-Nothing comes.
-Most interesting.

101
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,720
It’s like trying to pick a lock
with a wet herring.

102
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:49,987
Tell me, are you lately humbled
in the act of love?

103
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:53,581
How long has it been?

104
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:57,661
A goodly length in times past,
but lately...

105
00:07:57,662 --> 00:08:00,941
No, no.
You have a wife, children?

106
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,582
Aye.

107
00:08:06,662 --> 00:08:10,981
I was a lad of 18. Anne Hathaway
was a woman half as old again.

108
00:08:10,982 --> 00:08:13,902
-A woman of property?
-She had a cottage.

109
00:08:13,983 --> 00:08:17,229
One day she was 3 months
gone with child, so...

110
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,582
And your relations?

111
00:08:18,622 --> 00:08:22,222
-On my mother’s side, the Ardens.
-No, your marriage bed.

112
00:08:22,223 --> 00:08:25,663
4 years and a 100 miles away
in Stratford.

113
00:08:25,743 --> 00:08:29,383
A cold bed, too,
since the twins were born.

114
00:08:29,463 --> 00:08:31,302
Banishment was a blessing.

115
00:08:31,383 --> 00:08:36,322
-So, now you are free to love...
-Yet cannot love, nor write it.

116
00:08:37,424 --> 00:08:41,104
Here is a... a bangle...

117
00:08:41,184 --> 00:08:44,544
found in Psyche’s temple
on Olympus.

118
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,824
Cheap at 4 pence.

119
00:08:46,904 --> 00:08:51,624
Write your name on a paper
and feed it into the snake.

120
00:08:51,704 --> 00:08:53,624
Will it restore my gift?

121
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,984
The woman who wears the snake will
dream of you, and your gift will return.

122
00:08:56,985 --> 00:09:00,066
Words will flow like a river.

123
00:09:00,145 --> 00:09:02,149
See you next week.

124
00:09:03,505 --> 00:09:06,421
-Now where?
-To the palace at Whitehall.

125
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:09,666
All right.

126
00:09:11,746 --> 00:09:13,026
Hello, Will.

127
00:09:13,106 --> 00:09:16,026
Prithee, Mr. Kempe. Break a leg.

128
00:09:16,106 --> 00:09:19,826
-You too, good Crab.
-Crab’s nervous. He’s never played the palace.

129
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:22,225
When will you write me
a tragedy, Will?

130
00:09:22,226 --> 00:09:25,505
-I could do it.
-No, they'd laugh at Seneca if you played it.

131
00:09:25,506 --> 00:09:28,706
There is no dog in the first scene,
Mr. Kempe, thank you.

132
00:09:28,707 --> 00:09:31,754
-How goes it, Will?
-I’m still owed money for this play...

133
00:09:31,797 --> 00:09:33,866
-Burbage.
-Not by me. I only stole it.

134
00:09:33,986 --> 00:09:36,386
My sleeve wants for a button,
Mistress Rosaline.

135
00:09:36,387 --> 00:09:38,717
Where were my seamstress' eyes?

136
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,405
When are you coming over
to the Chamberlain’s Men?

137
00:09:41,406 --> 00:09:42,586
When I have £50.

138
00:09:42,587 --> 00:09:45,947
-You writing?
-A comedy. All but done.

139
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:47,753
A pirate comedy.

140
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,451
-Wonderful.
-Bring it tomorrow.

141
00:09:49,476 --> 00:09:51,762
-It’s for Henslowe. He paid me.
-How much?

142
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:53,082
-£10.
-You’re a liar.

143
00:09:53,122 --> 00:09:56,801
He wants Romeo for Ned
and the Admiral’s Men.

144
00:09:56,802 --> 00:09:58,547
Mmm. Ned’s wrong for it.

145
00:09:58,548 --> 00:10:00,908
Will?

146
00:10:00,989 --> 00:10:04,116
Here’s 2 sovereigns. I'll give
you another 2 when I see the pages.

147
00:10:04,156 --> 00:10:06,096
-Done.
-Burbage, I will see you hanged...

148
00:10:06,097 --> 00:10:08,158
-for a pickpocket.
-The queen has commanded it.

149
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,589
She loves a comedy. And
the Master of the Revels favours us.

150
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:14,510
And what favour does Mr. Tilney
receive from you?

151
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:16,389
-Ask him.
-She comes!

152
00:10:41,711 --> 00:10:44,071
<i>Cease to persuade,
my loving Proteus.</i>

153
00:10:44,072 --> 00:10:46,271
<i>Home-keeping youth
have ever homely wits,</i>

154
00:10:46,272 --> 00:10:50,089
<i>were it not affection
chains thy tender days...</i>

155
00:10:51,911 --> 00:10:54,271
When will you write me a sonnet, Will?

156
00:10:54,272 --> 00:10:57,671
-I’ve lost my gift.
-You left it in my bed.

157
00:10:57,672 --> 00:10:59,472
Come to look for it again.

158
00:11:05,152 --> 00:11:08,912
Are you to be my muse, Rosaline?

159
00:11:08,992 --> 00:11:11,952
Burbage has my keeping...

160
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:14,038
but you have my heart.

161
00:11:16,472 --> 00:11:18,432
You see?
The consumptives plot against me.

162
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:20,352
Will Shakespeare has a play.

163
00:11:20,353 --> 00:11:22,673
Let’s go and cough through it.

164
00:11:24,353 --> 00:11:27,553
<i>My father weeping,
my mother wailing...</i>

165
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:32,113
<i>our maid howling,
our cat wringing her hands.</i>

166
00:11:32,194 --> 00:11:35,434
<i>Yet did not this coldhearted cur...</i>

167
00:11:35,515 --> 00:11:38,314
<i>shed one tear...</i>

168
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,555
You see?
Comedy.

169
00:11:54,762 --> 00:11:58,516
Love, and a bit with a dog.
That’s what they want.

170
00:12:06,196 --> 00:12:09,956
<i>He is a stone, a very pebble stone,</i>

171
00:12:10,037 --> 00:12:13,877
<i>and has no more pity in him
than a dog!</i>

172
00:12:13,956 --> 00:12:16,836
<i>A Jew would have wept
to have seen our parting.</i>

173
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:21,517
<i>Now the dog all this while
sheds not a tear, nor speaks a word...</i>

174
00:12:21,598 --> 00:12:23,998
Well played, Master Crab!

175
00:12:24,758 --> 00:12:27,958
I commend you!

176
00:12:30,758 --> 00:12:33,358
<i>What light is light...</i>

177
00:12:33,438 --> 00:12:35,764
<i>if Silvia be not seen?</i>

178
00:12:36,358 --> 00:12:38,838
<i>What joy is joy...</i>

179
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:41,079
<i>if Silvia be not by?</i>

180
00:12:41,158 --> 00:12:43,959
<i>Unless it be to think that she is by...</i>

181
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:47,799
<i>and feed upon the shadow of perfection.</i>

182
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:52,119
<i>Except I be by Silvia
in the night,</i>

183
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:55,519
<i>there is no music
in the nightingale.</i>

184
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,399
<i>Unless I look on Silvia
in the day,</i>

185
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:01,760
<i>there is no day for me to look upon.</i>

186
00:13:24,161 --> 00:13:27,640
Did you like Proteus
or Valentine best?

187
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:30,521
Proteus for speaking.
Valentine for looks.

188
00:13:30,522 --> 00:13:32,921
Oh, I liked the dog for laughs.

189
00:13:32,922 --> 00:13:35,320
Silvia, I did not care for much.

190
00:13:35,322 --> 00:13:37,240
His fingers were red
from fighting...

191
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:40,361
and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons.

192
00:13:40,442 --> 00:13:44,469
Stage love will never be true love
while the law of the land...

193
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,241
has our heroines being played
by pipsqueak boys in petticoats.

194
00:13:48,242 --> 00:13:51,282
-Oh, when can we see another?
-When the queen commands it.

195
00:13:51,283 --> 00:13:53,122
No, but at the playhouse. Nurse!

196
00:13:53,203 --> 00:13:56,922
Be still. Playhouses are not
for wellborn ladies.

197
00:13:56,923 --> 00:13:59,083
Oh! I’m not so wellborn.

198
00:13:59,163 --> 00:14:01,562
Well-monied is the same
as wellborn,

199
00:14:01,563 --> 00:14:03,962
and well-married
is more so.

200
00:14:03,963 --> 00:14:06,313
Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.

201
00:14:06,364 --> 00:14:08,762
All the men at court
are without poetry.

202
00:14:08,763 --> 00:14:11,642
If they see me, they see
my father’s fortune.

203
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:15,084
I will have poetry in my life...

204
00:14:15,164 --> 00:14:17,003
and adventure.

205
00:14:18,084 --> 00:14:20,644
And love.
Love above all.

206
00:14:20,724 --> 00:14:22,604
Like Valentine and Silvia?

207
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:26,365
No, not the artful postures of love...

208
00:14:26,444 --> 00:14:30,285
but love that overthrows life.

209
00:14:30,365 --> 00:14:33,885
Unbiddable, ungovernable,
like a riot in the heart...

210
00:14:33,966 --> 00:14:38,205
and nothing to be done,
come ruin or rapture.

211
00:14:38,206 --> 00:14:41,726
Love as there has never been
in a play.

212
00:14:41,805 --> 00:14:45,566
I will have love,
or I will end my days as...

213
00:14:45,646 --> 00:14:47,486
As a nurse?

214
00:14:48,685 --> 00:14:52,166
Oh, but I would be
Valentine and Silvia too.

215
00:14:52,246 --> 00:14:56,322
Oh, good nurse,
God save you, and good night.

216
00:14:57,446 --> 00:15:00,246
I would stay asleep my whole life...

217
00:15:00,326 --> 00:15:04,087
if I could dream myself
into a company of players.

218
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:07,082
Clean your teeth
while you dream, then.

219
00:15:09,807 --> 00:15:12,287
Now spit.

220
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:37,969
This time the boots are coming off.

221
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:39,343
What have I done?

222
00:15:39,408 --> 00:15:41,408
The theaters have all been
closed down by the plague.

223
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:44,209
-Oh, that.
-By order of the Master of the Revels.

224
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:48,529
Mr. Fennyman, allow me to explain
about the theater business.

225
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:53,163
The natural condition is one of insurmountable
obstacles on the road to imminent disaster.

226
00:15:53,206 --> 00:15:55,010
-So what do we do?
-Nothing.

227
00:15:55,089 --> 00:15:57,774
Strangely enough,
it all turns out well.

228
00:15:57,816 --> 00:16:01,199
-How?
-I don’t know. It’s a mystery.

229
00:16:01,234 --> 00:16:03,490
Shall I kill him, Mr. Fennyman?

230
00:16:03,491 --> 00:16:05,291
The theaters are reopened...

231
00:16:05,411 --> 00:16:08,931
by order of the Master of the Revels!

232
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:12,052
The theaters are reopened!

233
00:16:12,786 --> 00:16:16,331
Mr. Fennyman, Mr. Tilney
has reopened the playhouses.

234
00:16:16,451 --> 00:16:18,651
If you wouldn’t mind.

235
00:16:22,197 --> 00:16:25,892
-Where’s the play?
-Oh, it’s coming. It’s coming.

236
00:16:28,452 --> 00:16:30,252
It’s coming.

237
00:16:41,012 --> 00:16:42,813
Will!

238
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:44,733
Will, I have wonderful news.

239
00:16:44,853 --> 00:16:46,772
So have I.
Romeo and Rosaline, scene one.

240
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:48,573
God, I’m good!

241
00:16:48,693 --> 00:16:51,453
Rosaline?
You mean Ethel.

242
00:16:56,617 --> 00:16:58,292
Richard?

243
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:01,866
Burbage!

244
00:17:07,984 --> 00:17:09,614
Mr. Tilney.

245
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:13,215
Like you,
I found him not at home.

246
00:17:15,455 --> 00:17:18,215
I would’ve made you immortal.

247
00:17:20,975 --> 00:17:24,014
Tell Burbage he has lost
a new play by Will Shakespeare.

248
00:17:24,015 --> 00:17:26,576
What does Burbage care of that?

249
00:17:26,656 --> 00:17:30,256
He’s readying the "Curtain"
for Kit Marlowe.

250
00:17:30,336 --> 00:17:33,456
-You’ve opened the playhouses?
-I have, Master Shakespeare.

251
00:17:33,536 --> 00:17:36,415
-But the plague...
-Yes, I know...

252
00:17:36,496 --> 00:17:39,296
but he was always hanging around the house.

253
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:56,176
The special today is a pig’s foot
marinated in juniper berry vinegar,

254
00:17:56,177 --> 00:17:58,061
served on a buckwheat pancake...

255
00:17:58,139 --> 00:18:02,921
-Will! Have you finished?
-Yes, nearly.

256
00:18:02,946 --> 00:18:05,562
Good morning, Master Nol.
You'll have a nice part.

257
00:18:05,563 --> 00:18:08,792
-Yes!
-We’ll need Ralph for the pirate king.

258
00:18:08,793 --> 00:18:10,978
Clear that bloody table!

259
00:18:10,979 --> 00:18:13,897
None other than the Admiral’s Men
are out on tour.

260
00:18:13,898 --> 00:18:15,978
I need actors!

261
00:18:16,058 --> 00:18:19,897
Those of you who are unknown
will have a chance to be known!

262
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:24,978
-What about the money, Mr. Henslowe?
-It won’t cost you a penny! Ha ha ha!

263
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:26,739
Auditions in half an hour!

264
00:18:32,017 --> 00:18:34,280
Ralph Bagswell,
I'd have a part for you...

265
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:36,544
but, alas, I hear you are
a drunkard’s drunkard.

266
00:18:36,586 --> 00:18:38,671
Never when I’m working.

267
00:18:39,176 --> 00:18:41,260
Never when I’m working!

268
00:18:42,376 --> 00:18:46,341
-Get me to drink mandragora.
-Straight up, Will?

269
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,590
Give my friend a beaker
of your best brandy.

270
00:18:49,801 --> 00:18:51,261
Kit.

271
00:18:51,581 --> 00:18:54,591
-How goes it, Will?
-Wonderful. Wonderful.

272
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,620
-Burbage says you have a play.
-I have, and the chinks to show for it.

273
00:18:58,621 --> 00:19:01,261
I insist.
A beaker for Mr. Marlowe.

274
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,220
I hear you have a new play
for the "Curtain".

275
00:19:04,263 --> 00:19:06,300
Not new.
My "Doctor Faustus".

276
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:08,998
Ah. I love your early work.

277
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:11,621
<i>Was this the face that
launched a thousand ships...</i>

278
00:19:11,622 --> 00:19:14,141
<i>and burnt the topless towers
of llium?"</i>

279
00:19:14,142 --> 00:19:17,010
I have a new one
nearly finished, and better.

280
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,862
"The Massacre at Paris".

281
00:19:20,405 --> 00:19:23,543
-Good title.
-Yours?

282
00:19:23,623 --> 00:19:26,250
"Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate’s Daughter".

283
00:19:28,249 --> 00:19:31,703
-Yes, I know. I know.
-What is the story?

284
00:19:32,389 --> 00:19:34,683
Well, there’s this pirate...

285
00:19:37,205 --> 00:19:39,980
In truth,
I have not written a word.

286
00:19:40,664 --> 00:19:42,788
Romeo.

287
00:19:42,825 --> 00:19:45,744
Romeo is Italian...

288
00:19:45,824 --> 00:19:47,984
always in and out of love.

289
00:19:48,065 --> 00:19:50,263
Yes, that’s good.
Until he meets...

290
00:19:50,264 --> 00:19:52,504
-Ethel.
-Do you think?

291
00:19:52,585 --> 00:19:55,024
-The daughter of his enemy.
-The daughter of his enemy.

292
00:19:55,025 --> 00:19:57,224
His best friend
is killed in a duel...

293
00:19:57,225 --> 00:20:00,664
by Ethel’s brother, or something.
His name is Mercutio.

294
00:20:00,665 --> 00:20:02,505
Mercutio.
Good name.

295
00:20:02,586 --> 00:20:05,865
-Will! They’re waiting for you!
-Yes, I’m coming.

296
00:20:05,944 --> 00:20:08,585
Good luck with yours, Kit.

297
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,334
I thought your play
was for Burbage.

298
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:14,428
-This is a different one.
-A different one you haven’t written?

299
00:20:15,146 --> 00:20:16,785
<i>Was this the face...</i>

300
00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:19,305
<i>that launched a thousand ships...</i>

301
00:20:19,306 --> 00:20:21,704
<i>and burnt the topless
towers of llium?</i>

302
00:20:21,705 --> 00:20:23,226
Thank you!

303
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,865
<i>Was this the face that
launched a thousand ships...</i>

304
00:20:25,866 --> 00:20:27,183
<i>And burnt the top-</i>

305
00:20:27,223 --> 00:20:28,546
Thank you!

306
00:20:28,547 --> 00:20:30,466
<i>Was this the face...</i>

307
00:20:30,467 --> 00:20:33,986
<i>that launched a thousand ships
and burnt the topless towers...</i>

308
00:20:33,987 --> 00:20:36,647
I would like to give you something
from Faustus...

309
00:20:36,648 --> 00:20:38,948
-by Christopher Marlowe.
-How refreshing.

310
00:20:38,949 --> 00:20:40,666
<i>...the topless towers of llium?</i>

311
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:43,667
<i>Sweet Helen,
make me immortal with a kiss.</i>

312
00:20:46,908 --> 00:20:48,747
<i>W- W- Was this the f...</i>

313
00:20:48,828 --> 00:20:52,261
Very good, Mr. Wabash.
Report to the property master.

314
00:20:53,389 --> 00:20:56,353
My tailor wants to be an actor.

315
00:20:56,378 --> 00:21:00,021
I have a few debts here and there.
Well, that seems to be everybody.

316
00:21:00,396 --> 00:21:02,398
-Did you see a "Romeo"?
-I did not.

317
00:21:02,437 --> 00:21:05,002
Well, I to my work,
you to yours.

318
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:07,869
Oh, God.

319
00:21:12,621 --> 00:21:14,883
May I begin, sir?

320
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:18,630
-Your name?
-Thomas Kent.

321
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,738
I would like to do a speech
by a writer...

322
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:24,042
who commands the heart of every player.

323
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:30,910
<i>What light is light...</i>

324
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,809
<i>if Silvia be not seen?</i>

325
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:39,205
<i>What joy is joy
if Silvia be not by?</i>

326
00:21:40,271 --> 00:21:46,412
<i>Unless it be to think that she is by
and feed upon the shadow of perfection.</i>

327
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:52,525
<i>Except I be by Silvia
in the night...</i>

328
00:21:53,072 --> 00:21:56,298
<i>there is no music
in the nightingale.</i>

329
00:21:56,832 --> 00:22:00,672
<i>Unless I look on Silvia
in the day...</i>

330
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:04,467
<i>there is no day
for me to look upon.</i>

331
00:22:05,233 --> 00:22:10,173
<i>She is my essence,
and I leave to be if I be not...</i>

332
00:22:10,193 --> 00:22:12,913
-Take off your hat!
-My hat?

333
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:15,673
Where’d you learn how to do that?

334
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,992
-I...
-Let me see you. Take off your hat.

335
00:22:17,993 --> 00:22:22,272
-Are you M-Master Shakespeare?
-Wait there. Wait there!

336
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:38,048
-Will, w-where are the pages?
-Where is the boy?

337
00:22:40,981 --> 00:22:43,915
B- B- B- Break a leg!

338
00:22:47,476 --> 00:22:50,274
Sir, will you buy my sweet orange?

339
00:23:08,296 --> 00:23:09,547
Hey!

340
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:29,157
Everybody ready? All away!

341
00:23:30,358 --> 00:23:33,512
-Follow that boat!
-Right you are, governor.

342
00:23:38,412 --> 00:23:41,315
I know your face.
Are you an actor?

343
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:44,605
-Yes.
-Yes, I think I’ve seen you in something.

344
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:47,476
-That one about a king.
-Really?

345
00:23:47,585 --> 00:23:50,967
I had that Christopher Marlowe
in my boat once.

346
00:24:02,202 --> 00:24:05,760
-Do you know that house?
-Sir Robert De Lesseps.

347
00:24:15,609 --> 00:24:19,325
Where is she?
Our guests are upon us!

348
00:24:19,362 --> 00:24:23,081
Lord Wessex, too,
bargaining for a bride.

349
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:26,041
My husband will have it settled tonight.

350
00:24:26,122 --> 00:24:28,560
Stamped, sealed
and celebrated.

351
00:24:28,561 --> 00:24:31,641
Tomorrow he drags me off to the country...

352
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:36,430
and it will be three weeks gone
before we return from our estates.

353
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,562
God save you, Mother.

354
00:24:39,641 --> 00:24:42,442
Hot water, Nurse.

355
00:24:45,562 --> 00:24:47,321
I seek Master Thomas Kent.

356
00:24:47,322 --> 00:24:49,231
-Who, sir?
-The actor.

357
00:24:49,243 --> 00:24:51,561
-Who asks for him?
-Will Shakespeare.

358
00:24:51,562 --> 00:24:54,564
Poet, playwright of the "Rose".

359
00:24:54,673 --> 00:24:55,883
Master Kent...

360
00:24:55,962 --> 00:24:58,923
is my nephew.

361
00:24:59,003 --> 00:25:00,844
I will wait.

362
00:25:00,923 --> 00:25:03,243
Much good may it do you.

363
00:25:06,523 --> 00:25:08,684
<i>"Romeo Montague...</i>

364
00:25:08,764 --> 00:25:10,663
<i>a Young Man of Verona".</i>

365
00:25:10,684 --> 00:25:12,524
Verona again?

366
00:25:12,604 --> 00:25:14,523
<i>"A comedy of quarreling families...</i>

367
00:25:14,524 --> 00:25:16,763
<i>"reconciled in the discovery
of Romeo...</i>

368
00:25:16,764 --> 00:25:19,163
<i>"to be the very same Capulet cousin...</i>

369
00:25:19,164 --> 00:25:22,883
<i>"stolen from the cradle and fostered
to manhood by his Montague mother...</i>

370
00:25:22,884 --> 00:25:27,165
<i>"that was robbed of her own child
by the pirate king".</i>

371
00:25:27,244 --> 00:25:29,164
Your mother and your father...

372
00:25:29,165 --> 00:25:32,044
From tomorrow,
away in the country for three weeks!

373
00:25:33,213 --> 00:25:35,251
Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?

374
00:25:35,276 --> 00:25:37,761
-He looks well enough for a charlatan.
-Oh, Nurse!

375
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:41,119
He would give Thomas Kent the life
of Viola De Lesseps' dreaming.

376
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,565
My lady, when your parents return,
I will tell.

377
00:25:43,566 --> 00:25:45,406
You will not tell.

378
00:25:45,486 --> 00:25:47,726
As I love you and you love me...

379
00:25:47,727 --> 00:25:51,927
you will bind my breast
and buy me a boy’s wig.

380
00:25:57,036 --> 00:26:00,326
- Master Plum. What business here?
-The 5 schilling business, Will.

381
00:26:00,327 --> 00:26:02,407
We play for the dancing.

382
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,237
-I seek Master Thomas Kent.
-Musicians don’t eat.

383
00:26:24,385 --> 00:26:26,398
Sir Robert’s orders.

384
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:29,058
She’s a beauty, my lord,
as would take...

385
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:31,526
a king to church
for the dowry of a nutmeg.

386
00:26:31,569 --> 00:26:35,265
My plantations in Virginia
are not mortgaged for a nutmeg.

387
00:26:35,323 --> 00:26:37,808
I have an ancient name
which will bring you preferment...

388
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:39,729
when your grandson is a Wessex.

389
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,974
-Is she fertile?
-Oh, she will breed.

390
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:45,961
-If she do not, send her back.
-Is she obedient?

391
00:26:46,006 --> 00:26:49,543
As any mule in Christendom.
But if you are the man to ride her...

392
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,593
there are rubies in the saddlebag.

393
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,704
I like her.

394
00:27:13,785 --> 00:27:17,771
By all the stars in heaven.
Who is she?

395
00:27:17,852 --> 00:27:21,172
Viola De Lesseps?
Dream on, Will.

396
00:27:58,018 --> 00:28:00,103
Master Shakespeare.

397
00:28:06,589 --> 00:28:09,363
-My lady Viola.
-My lord.

398
00:28:09,835 --> 00:28:12,114
I have spoken with your father.

399
00:28:12,235 --> 00:28:15,433
So, my lord?
I speak with him every day.

400
00:28:32,194 --> 00:28:33,919
Good sir.

401
00:28:35,016 --> 00:28:37,519
I heard you were a poet.

402
00:28:40,616 --> 00:28:42,897
A poet of no words?

403
00:28:48,156 --> 00:28:49,824
Poet?

404
00:28:50,212 --> 00:28:54,030
I was a poet till now, but I’ve seen
beauty that puts...

405
00:28:54,031 --> 00:28:57,779
my poems at one with
the talking ravens in the Tower.

406
00:28:57,811 --> 00:29:00,597
-How do I offend, my lord?
-By coveting my property.

407
00:29:00,598 --> 00:29:03,291
I cannot shed blood in her house,
but I will cut your throat...

408
00:29:03,338 --> 00:29:05,618
anon.
Do you have a name?

409
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:08,378
Christopher Marlowe,
at your service.

410
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,819
Romeo! Romeo!

411
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:36,699
A Young Man of Verona.

412
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,421
A comedy by William Shakespeare.

413
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,459
-My lady!
-Who is there?

414
00:29:43,501 --> 00:29:45,814
-Will Shakespeare.
-Madam!

415
00:29:46,595 --> 00:29:48,945
Anon, good nurse,
anon.

416
00:29:49,402 --> 00:29:53,217
-Master Shakespeare?
-The same, alas.

417
00:29:53,256 --> 00:29:55,854
-But why alas?
-A lowly player.

418
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:59,581
Alas, indeed, for I thought you
the highest poet of my esteem...

419
00:29:59,582 --> 00:30:02,219
and a writer of plays
that capture my heart.

420
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,542
-I am him too.
-Madam!

421
00:30:04,621 --> 00:30:07,422
Anon!
I will come again.

422
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:12,404
Oh, I am fortune’s fool.
I will be punished for this.

423
00:30:15,152 --> 00:30:16,982
Oh, my lady, my love!

424
00:30:17,998 --> 00:30:20,012
If they find you here, they will kill you.

425
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:23,742
-You can bring them with a word.
-Oh, not for the world.

426
00:30:23,743 --> 00:30:26,783
-Madam!
-Anon!

427
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:25,307
<i>Draw, if you be men!</i>

428
00:31:25,344 --> 00:31:27,347
<i>Gregory,
remember thy swashing blow!</i>

429
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:30,666
<i>Part, fools! Put up your swords.
You know not what you do.</i>

430
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:33,546
It starts well, then it’s all long-faced
about some Rosaline.

431
00:31:33,589 --> 00:31:36,365
Where’s the comedy, Will?
Where’s the dog?

432
00:31:36,392 --> 00:31:37,829
Do you think it’s funny?

433
00:31:37,867 --> 00:31:41,167
I was a pirate king, now I’m a nurse.
That’s funny.

434
00:31:41,215 --> 00:31:44,097
We are 6 men short, and those we
have will be over parted ranters...

435
00:31:44,098 --> 00:31:46,156
and stutterers who should be
sent back to the stews.

436
00:31:46,217 --> 00:31:48,347
My Romeo’s let me down.
I see disaster.

437
00:31:48,348 --> 00:31:50,866
We are 4 acts short,
if you’re looking for disaster.

438
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:53,585
-Sir!
-Who are you, master?

439
00:31:53,813 --> 00:31:56,309
I’m Ethel, sir, the pirate’s daughter.

440
00:31:56,842 --> 00:31:59,220
I'll be damned if you are!

441
00:32:00,808 --> 00:32:02,511
Your attention, please!

442
00:32:02,548 --> 00:32:05,828
-Gentlemen, thank you!
-You are welcome.

443
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:08,468
-Who’s that?
-Nobody. He’s the author.

444
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:11,428
We are about to embark on a great voyage.

445
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:14,818
It is customary to make a little speech
on the first day.

446
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:17,269
It does no harm.
Authors like it.

447
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:20,549
You want to know what parts you are
to receive. All will be settled as we...

448
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,390
I’ll do it.

449
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,790
Now listen to me, you dregs.

450
00:32:24,871 --> 00:32:26,789
Actors are 10 a penny...

451
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:31,016
and I, Hugh Fennyman,
hold your nuts in my hand.

452
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,631
Huzzah!

453
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:36,151
The Admiral’s Men
are returned to the house!

454
00:32:36,231 --> 00:32:38,151
Huzzah!

455
00:32:39,043 --> 00:32:40,113
Ned!

456
00:32:41,431 --> 00:32:44,231
Henslowe!

457
00:32:44,311 --> 00:32:46,151
Earl! Good to see you.

458
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,502
Who is this?

459
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,925
Silence, you dog!

460
00:32:54,912 --> 00:32:56,814
I am "Hieronimo".

461
00:32:57,412 --> 00:33:01,017
I am "Tamburlaine".
I am "Faustus".

462
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:05,649
I am "Barabbas",
the Jew of Malta.

463
00:33:07,221 --> 00:33:09,556
Oh, yes, Master Will.
I am "Henry the 6th".

464
00:33:10,164 --> 00:33:13,432
What is the play,
and what is my part?

465
00:33:13,513 --> 00:33:15,872
-Uh, one moment, sir...
-Who are you?

466
00:33:16,873 --> 00:33:20,481
I’m, um... I’m the money.

467
00:33:20,506 --> 00:33:23,593
Then you may remain,
so long as you remain silent.

468
00:33:23,674 --> 00:33:27,343
Pay attention. You will see
how genius creates a legend.

469
00:33:27,383 --> 00:33:29,692
-Thank you, sir.
-We are in desperate want...

470
00:33:29,693 --> 00:33:32,874
of a "Mercutio", Ned.
A young nobleman of Verona.

471
00:33:32,954 --> 00:33:34,873
-And the title of this piece?
-"Mercutio".

472
00:33:34,874 --> 00:33:36,125
Is it?

473
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:39,255
I will play him.

474
00:33:40,914 --> 00:33:43,715
Mr. Pope. Mr. Philips.
Welcome.

475
00:33:43,795 --> 00:33:45,673
George Bryan.
James Armitage.

476
00:33:45,674 --> 00:33:47,809
Sam, my pretty one!

477
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:51,435
-Are you ready to fall in love again?
-I am, Master Shakespeare.

478
00:33:51,515 --> 00:33:53,635
Your voice.
Have they dropped?

479
00:33:53,716 --> 00:33:55,995
No! No.
A touch of cold only.

480
00:33:56,115 --> 00:34:00,603
Master Henslowe, you have your actors,
except Thomas Kent.

481
00:34:00,716 --> 00:34:03,076
I saw his "Tamburlaine", you know.

482
00:34:03,156 --> 00:34:05,075
-It was wonderful.
-Yes, I saw it.

483
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:06,995
Of course, such mighty writing.

484
00:34:06,996 --> 00:34:09,520
There’s no one like Marlowe.

485
00:34:22,558 --> 00:34:24,465
Better fortune, boy.

486
00:34:24,466 --> 00:34:25,958
I was in a play.

487
00:34:26,204 --> 00:34:29,218
They cut my head off
in "Titus Andronicus".

488
00:34:29,243 --> 00:34:32,197
When I write plays,
they’ll be like "Titus".

489
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,678
You admire it.

490
00:34:33,758 --> 00:34:35,829
I liked it when they cut heads off,

491
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:38,638
and the daughter mutilated with knives.

492
00:34:38,718 --> 00:34:41,381
-What’s your name?
-John Webster.

493
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:42,719
Here, kitty, kitty.

494
00:34:47,404 --> 00:34:49,119
Plenty of blood.

495
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,998
That’s the only writing.

496
00:34:52,118 --> 00:34:54,357
I have to get back.

497
00:34:54,393 --> 00:34:57,245
<i>See, where he comes.
So please you step aside.</i>

498
00:34:57,287 --> 00:34:59,392
<i>I’ll know his grievance,
or be much denied.</i>

499
00:34:59,435 --> 00:35:02,879
<i>I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
to hear true shrift. Come, madam.</i>

500
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,139
Cut around him for now.

501
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,476
-What? Who?
-Romeo.

502
00:35:05,477 --> 00:35:07,374
-The one who came with your letter.
-What?

503
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:08,950
<i>Good morrow, cousin.</i>

504
00:35:08,994 --> 00:35:12,424
<i>-Is the day so young?
-But new struck nine.</i>

505
00:35:12,491 --> 00:35:14,579
<i>Ay me.
Sad hours seem long.</i>

506
00:35:14,614 --> 00:35:17,003
<i>What sadness
lengthens Romeo’s hours?</i>

507
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,735
<i>Not having that which having
makes them short.</i>

508
00:35:19,775 --> 00:35:20,566
Good!

509
00:35:20,607 --> 00:35:22,154
<i>-In love?
-Out.</i>

510
00:35:22,155 --> 00:35:25,869
<i>-Of love?
-Out of her favour where I am in love.</i>

511
00:35:25,911 --> 00:35:28,466
No, no, don’t spend it all at once.

512
00:35:29,501 --> 00:35:31,175
Yes, sir.

513
00:35:31,211 --> 00:35:33,801
-Do you understand me?
-No, sir.

514
00:35:34,618 --> 00:35:37,080
You’re speaking about
a baggage we never even meet.

515
00:35:37,081 --> 00:35:40,281
What will be left in his purse
when he meets his Juliet?

516
00:35:40,282 --> 00:35:42,280
-Juliet? You mean Ethel.
-God’s teeth!

517
00:35:42,281 --> 00:35:45,562
Am I to suffer this constant stream
of interruption?

518
00:35:47,081 --> 00:35:52,042
What will he do in Act Two,
when he meets the love of his life?

519
00:35:52,043 --> 00:35:56,123
I’m very sorry, sir.
I have not seen Act Two.

520
00:35:57,205 --> 00:36:01,083
Of course you have not.
I have not written it. Go once more.

521
00:36:02,217 --> 00:36:05,243
Will.
Where is Mercutio?

522
00:36:05,323 --> 00:36:08,202
Locked safe in here. I’ll leave
the scene in your safekeeping, Ned.

523
00:36:08,203 --> 00:36:10,043
I have a sonnet to write.

524
00:36:10,123 --> 00:36:12,147
Sonnet?
You mean a play!

525
00:36:16,144 --> 00:36:21,602
<i>" For Lady Viola De Lesseps,
by the hand of Thomas Kent.</i>

526
00:36:22,323 --> 00:36:25,758
<i>" Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?</i>

527
00:36:25,793 --> 00:36:29,023
<i>" Thou art more lovely
and more temperate.</i>

528
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:33,842
<i>" Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May... "</i>

529
00:36:33,885 --> 00:36:35,805
Two hours at prayer!

530
00:36:35,886 --> 00:36:39,792
-Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
-Piety is for Sunday!

531
00:36:39,837 --> 00:36:42,778
And 2 hours of prayer is not piety,
it is self-importance.

532
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,178
It would be better that you return
tomorrow, my lord.

533
00:36:45,182 --> 00:36:47,900
It would be better if you’d tell her
to get off her knees and show...

534
00:36:47,942 --> 00:36:50,906
some civility to her 6day
lord and master!

535
00:36:53,604 --> 00:36:54,642
Mmmph!

536
00:37:00,579 --> 00:37:01,967
My lady Viola.

537
00:37:02,047 --> 00:37:05,201
Lord Wessex.
You’ve been waiting.

538
00:37:05,226 --> 00:37:06,287
I am aware of it.

539
00:37:07,487 --> 00:37:09,784
But it is beauty’s privilege.

540
00:37:10,053 --> 00:37:11,408
You flatter, my lord.

541
00:37:11,487 --> 00:37:15,088
No. I have spoken to the queen.

542
00:37:15,587 --> 00:37:19,027
Her Majesty’s consent is requisite
when a Wessex takes a wife...

543
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,747
and once given,
her consent is her command.

544
00:37:20,786 --> 00:37:23,185
Do you intend to marry, my lord?

545
00:37:23,248 --> 00:37:27,808
Your father should keep you better
informed. He has bought me for you.

546
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:32,767
He returns from his estates to see us
married two weeks from Saturday.

547
00:37:32,768 --> 00:37:35,349
You are allowed to show your pleasure.

548
00:37:36,369 --> 00:37:39,169
But I do not love you, my lord.

549
00:37:39,249 --> 00:37:41,889
How your mind hops about.

550
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:44,329
Your father was a shopkeeper.

551
00:37:44,354 --> 00:37:47,257
Your children will bear arms,
and I will recover my fortune.

552
00:37:47,258 --> 00:37:49,376
That is the only matter
under discussion today.

553
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:50,929
You will like Virginia.

554
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:53,490
-Virginia?
-Oh, yes.

555
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:56,533
My fortune lies in my plantations.
The tobacco weed.

556
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:00,089
I need 4,000 pounds to fit out a ship
and put my investments to work.

557
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:02,890
I fancy tobacco has a future.

558
00:38:02,971 --> 00:38:05,811
We will not stay there long, 3-4 years.

559
00:38:07,388 --> 00:38:10,130
-But why me?
-It was your eyes.

560
00:38:11,386 --> 00:38:13,152
No, your lips.

561
00:38:23,252 --> 00:38:26,131
Will you defy your father
and your queen?

562
00:38:26,132 --> 00:38:28,052
The queen has consented?

563
00:38:28,053 --> 00:38:29,892
She wants to inspect you.

564
00:38:29,972 --> 00:38:32,453
At Greenwich, come Sunday.

565
00:38:32,532 --> 00:38:38,613
Be submissive, modest,
grateful and brief.

566
00:38:40,053 --> 00:38:43,013
I will do my duty, my lord.

567
00:38:47,413 --> 00:38:51,973
<i>"Master Will,
poet dearest to my heart...</i>

568
00:38:52,054 --> 00:38:55,814
<i>I beseech you
banish me from yours.</i>

569
00:38:55,894 --> 00:38:59,013
<i>I am to marry Lord Wessex.</i>

570
00:39:00,055 --> 00:39:02,374
<i>A daughter’s duty...</i>

571
00:39:02,454 --> 00:39:04,774
<i>and the queen’s command".</i>

572
00:39:25,095 --> 00:39:29,096
Gentlemen upstage, Ladies downstage.

573
00:39:30,976 --> 00:39:34,456
Gentlemen upstage, Ladies downstage.

574
00:39:34,535 --> 00:39:37,655
Are you a lady Mr. Kent?

575
00:39:37,736 --> 00:39:39,417
I’m very sorry, sir.

576
00:39:41,897 --> 00:39:44,696
We’re gonna have to do it again.

577
00:39:45,977 --> 00:39:48,297
You did not like the speech?

578
00:39:48,377 --> 00:39:50,296
No, the speech is excellent.

579
00:39:50,297 --> 00:39:53,817
<i>Oh, then I see Queen Mab
hath been with you.</i>

580
00:39:53,897 --> 00:39:56,057
Excellent and a good length.

581
00:39:56,138 --> 00:40:00,337
But then he disappears
for the length of a bible.

582
00:40:01,457 --> 00:40:03,577
There. You have this duel.

583
00:40:03,658 --> 00:40:07,377
A skirmish of words and swords
such as I never wrote, nor anyone.

584
00:40:07,378 --> 00:40:12,218
He dies with such passion
and poetry as you ever heard.

585
00:40:12,298 --> 00:40:14,939
<i>A plague on both your houses!</i>

586
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:22,019
He dies?

587
00:40:24,978 --> 00:40:27,339
-Ohh!
-Will!

588
00:40:27,459 --> 00:40:29,339
Where are my pages?

589
00:40:41,059 --> 00:40:42,940
Did you give her my letter?

590
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,621
And this is for you!

591
00:40:59,021 --> 00:41:02,142
Oh, Thomas, she has cut my strings.

592
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:05,342
I’m unmanned...

593
00:41:05,461 --> 00:41:08,422
unmended and unmade...

594
00:41:08,501 --> 00:41:10,302
like a puppet in a box.

595
00:41:10,422 --> 00:41:13,023
-Writer, is he?
-Row your boat!

596
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:16,791
She tells me to keep away.
She is to marry Lord Wessex!

597
00:41:16,834 --> 00:41:18,193
What should I do?

598
00:41:18,418 --> 00:41:20,664
If you love her,
you must do as she asks.

599
00:41:20,704 --> 00:41:23,701
-And break her heart and mine?
-It is only yours you can know.

600
00:41:23,702 --> 00:41:26,994
-She loves me, Thomas!
-Does she say so?

601
00:41:26,995 --> 00:41:30,422
No, and yet she does where
the ink has run with tears.

602
00:41:30,423 --> 00:41:33,664
-Was she weeping when she gave you this?
-Uh...

603
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:36,958
-Her letter came to me by the nurse.
-Your aunt.

604
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:38,746
Yes, my aunt.

605
00:41:39,823 --> 00:41:42,104
But perhaps she wept a little.

606
00:41:44,304 --> 00:41:46,463
Tell me how you love her, Will.

607
00:41:46,544 --> 00:41:50,398
Like a sickness and its cure together.

608
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:52,585
Oh, yes.

609
00:41:52,664 --> 00:41:54,945
Like rain and sun.

610
00:41:55,024 --> 00:41:57,505
Like cold and heat.

611
00:41:58,586 --> 00:42:00,880
Is your lady beautiful?

612
00:42:01,604 --> 00:42:05,745
Since I came here from the country,
I have not seen her close.

613
00:42:05,825 --> 00:42:08,626
Tell me, is...
is she beautiful?

614
00:42:08,705 --> 00:42:12,345
Thomas, if I could write
with the beauty of her eyes...

615
00:42:12,346 --> 00:42:16,225
I was born to look in them
and know myself.

616
00:42:17,598 --> 00:42:19,994
-A-A-And her lips?
-Her lips?

617
00:42:20,036 --> 00:42:24,225
The early morning rose would wither
on the branch if it could feel envy.

618
00:42:24,226 --> 00:42:26,865
And her voice,
like lark’s song?

619
00:42:26,866 --> 00:42:29,746
Deeper, softer.
None of your twittering larks.

620
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:33,266
I would banish nightingales from her
garden before they interrupt her song.

621
00:42:33,267 --> 00:42:35,828
-Ah, she sings too?
-Constantly.

622
00:42:35,907 --> 00:42:39,227
Without doubt. And plays the lute.
She has a natural ear.

623
00:42:39,228 --> 00:42:41,187
And her bosom.

624
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:45,148
-Did I mention her bosom?
-What of her bosom?

625
00:42:45,227 --> 00:42:47,743
Oh, Thomas, a pair of pippins...

626
00:42:47,744 --> 00:42:50,629
as round and rare
as golden apples.

627
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:53,587
I think milady is wise
to keep your love at a distance.

628
00:42:53,588 --> 00:42:56,948
For what lady could live up
to it close to...

629
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,693
when her eyes and lips and voice...

630
00:42:59,694 --> 00:43:02,571
may be no more beautiful than mine.

631
00:43:02,604 --> 00:43:05,998
Besides, can a... can a lady of wealth
and noble marriage...

632
00:43:05,999 --> 00:43:09,548
love happily with
a bank side poet and player?

633
00:43:09,549 --> 00:43:11,750
Yes, by God!

634
00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:14,548
Love knows nothing
of rank or riverbank.

635
00:43:14,549 --> 00:43:17,668
It will spark between a queen and
the poor vagabond who plays the king...

636
00:43:17,669 --> 00:43:20,069
an their love should be minded by each...

637
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:22,709
for love denied blights
the soul we owe to God.

638
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:25,668
So tell my lady William Shakespeare
waits for her in the garden.

639
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:27,510
But what of Lord Wessex?

640
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:30,870
For one kiss I would defy
a thousand Wessexes.

641
00:43:38,471 --> 00:43:40,391
Oh, Will.

642
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:43,356
Thank you, my lady.

643
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:46,714
Lady?

644
00:43:46,813 --> 00:43:50,071
Viola De Lesseps.
Known her since she was this high.

645
00:43:50,408 --> 00:43:52,775
Wouldn’t deceive a child.

646
00:43:54,192 --> 00:43:58,312
Strangely enough,
I’m a bit of a writer me self.

647
00:43:58,393 --> 00:44:00,951
It wouldn’t take you long to read it.

648
00:44:00,952 --> 00:44:03,552
I expect you’d know all the booksellers!

649
00:44:11,793 --> 00:44:13,712
Can you love a fool?

650
00:44:13,713 --> 00:44:16,392
Can you love a player?

651
00:44:23,993 --> 00:44:26,334
Wait!
You’re still a maid...

652
00:44:26,335 --> 00:44:29,433
and perhaps as mistook in me
as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.

653
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:32,152
Are you the author of the plays
of William Shakespeare?

654
00:44:32,153 --> 00:44:33,674
I am.

655
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:36,554
Then kiss me again,
for I am not mistook.

656
00:44:49,075 --> 00:44:51,875
I do not know how to undress a man.

657
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:53,854
It is strange to me too.

658
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,720
Go to.
Go to.

659
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,440
I would not have thought it.

660
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,481
There is something
better than a play.

661
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,001
There is.

662
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,401
Even your play.

663
00:46:26,441 --> 00:46:28,241
Oh?

664
00:46:29,521 --> 00:46:31,977
And that was only my first try.

665
00:46:47,842 --> 00:46:49,642
Will.

666
00:46:51,982 --> 00:46:54,263
You would not leave me.

667
00:46:54,383 --> 00:46:56,253
I must.

668
00:46:56,482 --> 00:46:58,402
Look how pale the window.

669
00:46:58,403 --> 00:47:00,203
Moonlight.

670
00:47:00,322 --> 00:47:03,043
Mmm, no.
The morning rooster woke me.

671
00:47:03,164 --> 00:47:06,124
It was the owl.
Come to bed.

672
00:47:08,123 --> 00:47:10,404
Oh, let Henslowe wait.

673
00:47:12,283 --> 00:47:14,084
Mr. Henslowe?

674
00:47:14,204 --> 00:47:16,544
Mmm, let him be damned for his pages.

675
00:47:16,604 --> 00:47:18,404
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

676
00:47:18,525 --> 00:47:21,284
There is time. Mmm!
It is still dark.

677
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:24,244
-It’s broad day. The rooster tells us so.
-It was the owl.

678
00:47:24,284 --> 00:47:26,798
Believe me, love, it was the owl...

679
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:31,154
You would leave us players
without a scene to read today?

680
00:47:34,846 --> 00:47:35,845
My lady?

681
00:47:35,964 --> 00:47:38,602
The house is stirring.
It is a new day.

682
00:47:39,645 --> 00:47:41,926
It is a new world.

683
00:47:42,046 --> 00:47:44,904
<i>Good pilgrim,
you do wrong your hand too much...</i>

684
00:47:44,926 --> 00:47:47,484
<i>which mannerly devotion
shows in this.</i>

685
00:47:47,485 --> 00:47:50,645
<i>For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch...</i>

686
00:47:50,646 --> 00:47:53,927
<i>and palm to palm
is holy palmers' kiss.</i>

687
00:47:54,006 --> 00:47:57,567
<i>Have not saints lips,
and holy palmers too?</i>

688
00:47:57,646 --> 00:47:59,486
<i>Aye, pilgrim.</i>

689
00:47:59,566 --> 00:48:01,886
<i>Lips that they must use
in prayer.</i>

690
00:48:01,967 --> 00:48:05,086
<i>Oh, then, dear saint,
let lips do what hands do.</i>

691
00:48:05,087 --> 00:48:06,927
<i>They pray.</i>

692
00:48:07,007 --> 00:48:10,287
<i>Grant thou,
lest faith turn to despair.</i>

693
00:48:10,367 --> 00:48:13,648
<i>Saints do not move,
though grant for prayers' sake.</i>

694
00:48:15,287 --> 00:48:18,404
-It’s you.
-Suffering cats!

695
00:48:19,607 --> 00:48:24,609
<i>Then move not while
my prayer’s effect I take.</i>

696
00:48:28,769 --> 00:48:32,049
<i>Thus from my lips,
by thine my sin is purged.</i>

697
00:48:32,129 --> 00:48:34,847
<i>Then have my lips
the sin that they have took.</i>

698
00:48:34,848 --> 00:48:39,487
<i>Sin from my lips? Oh, trespass
sweetly urged. Give me my sin again.</i>

699
00:48:39,488 --> 00:48:42,009
Yes, yes!
Um, not quite right.

700
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:44,009
It is more...
Let me.

701
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:46,929
<i>Then have my lips
the sin that they have took.</i>

702
00:48:47,009 --> 00:48:51,863
<i>Sin from my lips? Oh, trespass
sweetly urged. Give me my sin again.</i>

703
00:48:57,330 --> 00:48:59,850
-You kiss by the book.
-Well, Will!

704
00:48:59,851 --> 00:49:01,850
It was lucky you were here.

705
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:04,329
-Why do not I write the rest of your play...
-Yes, yes!

706
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:08,371
Uh, continue. Now the nurse.
Where is Ralph?

707
00:49:08,651 --> 00:49:12,171
<i>Madam, your mother
craves a word with you.</i>

708
00:49:13,891 --> 00:49:16,611
<i>-What is her mother?
-Marry, bachelor,</i>

709
00:49:16,612 --> 00:49:19,171
<i>her mother is the lady of the house,
and a good lady...</i>

710
00:49:19,172 --> 00:49:21,292
<i>and a wise and virtuous.</i>

711
00:49:21,371 --> 00:49:24,251
<i>I nursed her daughter
that you talked withal.</i>

712
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:28,802
<i>I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
shall have the chinks.</i>

713
00:49:28,844 --> 00:49:30,896
<i>Is she a Capulet?</i>

714
00:49:30,963 --> 00:49:34,891
<i>Oh, dear account!
My life is my foe’s debt.</i>

715
00:49:34,892 --> 00:49:37,572
<i>Away. Be gone.
The sport is at the best.</i>

716
00:49:37,652 --> 00:49:40,613
<i>Aye, so I fear.
The more is my unrest.</i>

717
00:49:41,733 --> 00:49:44,853
<i>Come hither, nurse.
What is yon gentleman?</i>

718
00:49:44,932 --> 00:49:47,292
<i>The son and heir of old Tiberio.</i>

719
00:49:47,293 --> 00:49:49,531
Let it be night.

720
00:49:49,571 --> 00:49:52,932
<i>What’s he that follows
here that would not dance?</i>

721
00:49:52,933 --> 00:49:55,574
<i>-I know not.
-Go ask his name.</i>

722
00:49:56,934 --> 00:50:00,613
<i>If he be married, my grave is like
to be my wedding bed.</i>

723
00:50:02,218 --> 00:50:03,574
No, do not go.

724
00:50:03,654 --> 00:50:05,493
I must. I must.

725
00:50:05,574 --> 00:50:08,694
<i>-The only son of your great enemy.
-Terrible.</i>

726
00:50:08,774 --> 00:50:10,775
<i>Simply... terrible!</i>

727
00:50:16,935 --> 00:50:21,656
<i>But soft, what light
through yonder window breaks?</i>

728
00:50:21,736 --> 00:50:26,335
<i>It is the east,
and Juliet is the sun.</i>

729
00:50:26,416 --> 00:50:30,776
<i>Arise, fair sun,
and kill the envious moon...</i>

730
00:50:30,855 --> 00:50:33,735
<i>who is already sick
and pale with grief...</i>

731
00:50:33,736 --> 00:50:38,097
<i>that thou, her maid,
art far more fair than she".</i>

732
00:50:38,176 --> 00:50:40,814
-Oh, Will.
-Yes, some of it’s speak able.

733
00:50:40,852 --> 00:50:43,655
<i>It is my lady.
Oh, it is my love!</i>

734
00:50:43,656 --> 00:50:46,376
<i>Oh, that she knew she were!</i>

735
00:50:46,457 --> 00:50:49,897
<i>The brightness of her cheek
would shame those stars...</i>

736
00:50:49,977 --> 00:50:52,255
<i>as daylight doth a lamp".</i>

737
00:50:52,256 --> 00:50:55,336
<i>Her eyes in heaven would
through the airy region...</i>

738
00:50:55,337 --> 00:50:57,818
<i>stream so bright...</i>

739
00:50:57,897 --> 00:51:01,863
<i>that birds would sing
and think it were not night.</i>

740
00:51:01,905 --> 00:51:05,938
<i>See how she leans her cheek
upon her hand.</i>

741
00:51:06,018 --> 00:51:08,819
<i>Oh, that I were a glove
upon that hand...</i>

742
00:51:08,898 --> 00:51:11,058
<i>that I might touch that cheek.</i>

743
00:51:11,138 --> 00:51:12,271
<i>Ay, me.</i>

744
00:51:12,397 --> 00:51:16,178
<i>Oh, Romeo, Romeo!</i>

745
00:51:16,258 --> 00:51:18,738
<i>Wherefore art thou, Romeo?</i>

746
00:51:18,819 --> 00:51:22,298
<i>-Deny thy father and...
-and refuse thy name.</i>

747
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:25,178
<i>Or, if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love...</i>

748
00:51:25,179 --> 00:51:27,819
<i>and I’ll no longer be a Capulet.</i>

749
00:51:27,899 --> 00:51:30,681
<i>Shall I hear more,
or shall I speak at this?</i>

750
00:51:31,819 --> 00:51:34,538
<i>What man art thou that
thus be screened in night...</i>

751
00:51:34,539 --> 00:51:37,140
<i>so stumblest on my counsel?"</i>

752
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,386
<i>By a name I know not
how to tell thee who I am.</i>

753
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:44,979
<i>My name, dear saint, is hateful to
myself, because it is an enemy to thee.</i>

754
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:48,301
<i>Had I it written
I would tear the word.</i>

755
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:52,541
<i>The orchard walls are high
and hard to climb...</i>

756
00:51:52,621 --> 00:51:55,661
<i>and the place death,
considering who thou art...</i>

757
00:51:55,742 --> 00:51:58,300
<i>if any of my kinsmen find thee here.</i>

758
00:51:58,301 --> 00:52:01,222
<i>If they do see thee, they will murder thee.</i>

759
00:52:01,301 --> 00:52:05,621
<i>Alack, there lies more peril
in thine eye than 20 of their swords.</i>

760
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:09,940
<i>Look thou but sweet,
and I am proof against their enmity.</i>

761
00:52:09,941 --> 00:52:12,221
<i>Would not for the world
they saw thee here.</i>

762
00:52:12,222 --> 00:52:15,101
<i>I have night’s cloak
to hide me from their eyes.</i>

763
00:52:15,102 --> 00:52:18,462
<i>-And but thou love me let them find me here.
-Good night.</i>

764
00:52:18,582 --> 00:52:20,423
<i>Good night...</i>

765
00:52:20,502 --> 00:52:23,342
<i>as sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart...</i>

766
00:52:23,343 --> 00:52:25,623
<i>as that within my breast.</i>

767
00:52:25,702 --> 00:52:27,902
<i>Oh, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?</i>

768
00:52:27,903 --> 00:52:31,396
-That’s my line.
-Oh. It is mine too.

769
00:52:31,443 --> 00:52:34,396
<i>Oh, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?</i>

770
00:52:34,438 --> 00:52:36,875
<i>What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?</i>

771
00:52:36,922 --> 00:52:40,381
<i>The exchange of thy love’s
faithful vow for mine.</i>

772
00:52:40,424 --> 00:52:43,704
<i>My bounty is as boundless
as the sea.</i>

773
00:52:43,824 --> 00:52:46,344
<i>My love is deep.</i>

774
00:52:46,423 --> 00:52:48,864
<i>The more I give to thee...</i>

775
00:52:48,944 --> 00:52:50,824
<i>the more I have...</i>

776
00:52:50,904 --> 00:52:52,903
<i>for both are infinite.</i>

777
00:52:54,456 --> 00:52:55,265
Madam?

778
00:52:55,345 --> 00:52:59,305
<i>-I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.
-Juliet!</i>

779
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:01,113
Anon, good nurse.

780
00:53:01,114 --> 00:53:04,065
<i>Anon, good nurse
Sweet Montague, be true.</i>

781
00:53:04,185 --> 00:53:06,985
Stay but a little.
I will come again.

782
00:53:07,066 --> 00:53:09,865
<i>Stay but a little.
I will come again.</i>

783
00:53:09,945 --> 00:53:12,225
<i>Oh, blessed, blessed night.</i>

784
00:53:13,465 --> 00:53:15,745
<i>I am a feared...</i>

785
00:53:15,866 --> 00:53:20,066
<i>being in night,
all this is but a dream.</i>

786
00:53:20,186 --> 00:53:24,788
<i>Too flattering sweet
to be substantial.</i>

787
00:53:27,466 --> 00:53:30,346
<i>To cease thy strife
and leave me to my grief.</i>

788
00:53:30,347 --> 00:53:32,245
<i>A thousand times, good night.</i>

789
00:53:32,346 --> 00:53:34,746
<i>A thousand times
the worse to want thy light.</i>

790
00:53:34,747 --> 00:53:38,467
I cannot move in this dress.
It makes me look like a pig.

791
00:53:38,468 --> 00:53:41,988
I have no neck in this pig dress.

792
00:53:45,147 --> 00:53:48,667
-How is it?
-It’s all right.

793
00:53:52,428 --> 00:53:55,068
Ned, I know, I know.

794
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:57,949
-It’s good.
-Oh?

795
00:53:58,028 --> 00:54:00,668
The title won’t do.

796
00:54:00,748 --> 00:54:02,429
Ah.

797
00:54:02,508 --> 00:54:05,829
"Romeo and Juliet".
Just a suggestion.

798
00:54:06,989 --> 00:54:08,828
Thank you, Ned.

799
00:54:10,909 --> 00:54:15,869
-You are a gentleman.
-And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.

800
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:18,629
<i>-What o’clock tomorrow shall I send to thee?
-By the hour of nine.</i>

801
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,829
<i>I shall not fail.
"Tis 20 year till then.</i>

802
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:22,910
<i>I have forgot why I called thee back.</i>

803
00:54:22,989 --> 00:54:25,590
-You mean no dog of any kind?
-Shh! Silence.

804
00:54:25,796 --> 00:54:30,764
The friar marries them in secret, then Ned
gets into a fight with one of the Capulets.

805
00:54:30,793 --> 00:54:33,315
Romeo tries to stop them and gets in
Ned’s way.

806
00:54:33,357 --> 00:54:34,900
I mean, in Mercutio's way.

807
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:38,230
So Tybalt kills Mercutio,
then Romeo kills Tybalt.

808
00:54:38,231 --> 00:54:40,510
Then the prince banishes him
from Verona.

809
00:54:40,511 --> 00:54:42,710
That must be when he goes on the voyage
and gets shipwrecked...

810
00:54:42,791 --> 00:54:44,711
on the island of the pirate king.

811
00:54:44,712 --> 00:54:48,432
For God’s sake, cease your prattling
and get out!

812
00:54:48,512 --> 00:54:50,871
Get out!

813
00:54:53,431 --> 00:54:55,272
A thousand apologies.

814
00:54:56,952 --> 00:54:59,591
Please.

815
00:54:59,672 --> 00:55:02,391
<i>...and with a silken thread
plucks it back again...</i>

816
00:55:02,392 --> 00:55:04,632
<i>so loving-jealous
of his liberty.</i>

817
00:55:04,633 --> 00:55:07,123
<i>I would I were thy bird.</i>

818
00:55:07,124 --> 00:55:10,099
<i>-Sweet, so would I; yet I should
kill thee with much cherishing.</i>

819
00:55:10,513 --> 00:55:13,553
<i>Good night.
Good night.</i>

820
00:55:13,633 --> 00:55:18,380
<i>Parting is such sweet sorrow, that I
shall say good night till it be morrow.</i>

821
00:55:25,673 --> 00:55:28,354
Sunday.

822
00:55:28,434 --> 00:55:30,473
"Tis Sunday.

823
00:55:36,794 --> 00:55:39,634
I found something in my sleep.

824
00:55:39,715 --> 00:55:43,015
The friar who married them
will take up their destinies.

825
00:55:43,845 --> 00:55:47,603
-But it will end well for love.
-In heaven, perhaps.

826
00:55:47,655 --> 00:55:50,301
It is not a comedy I’m writing now.

827
00:55:52,055 --> 00:55:55,162
A broad river divides my lovers.

828
00:55:55,219 --> 00:55:58,595
Family, duty, fate.

829
00:56:00,789 --> 00:56:03,681
As unchangeable as nature.

830
00:56:03,799 --> 00:56:05,196
Yes.

831
00:56:06,584 --> 00:56:09,118
This is not life, Will.

832
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:12,068
It is a stolen season.

833
00:56:12,834 --> 00:56:14,156
Be patient, my lord.

834
00:56:14,157 --> 00:56:17,635
-Do you ask Her Majesty to be patient?
-My Lord, I will go...

835
00:56:17,636 --> 00:56:20,597
Sunday.
Greenwich!

836
00:56:23,957 --> 00:56:25,797
Now, pay attention, nursie.

837
00:56:25,876 --> 00:56:28,277
The queen...
Gloriana Regina...

838
00:56:28,357 --> 00:56:31,796
God’s chosen vessel, the radiant one
who shines her light on us...

839
00:56:31,797 --> 00:56:34,877
is at Greenwich today and prepared
during the evening’s festivities...

840
00:56:34,878 --> 00:56:37,997
to bestow her gracious favour
on my choice of wife.

841
00:56:37,998 --> 00:56:40,597
And if we’re late for lunch,
the old boot will not forgive!

842
00:56:40,598 --> 00:56:44,677
So get you to my lady’s chamber and produce her
with or without her undergarments!

843
00:56:44,678 --> 00:56:46,997
You cannot!
Not for the queen herself!

844
00:56:46,998 --> 00:56:50,116
What will you have me do?
Marry you instead?

845
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:52,245
To be the wife of a poor player?

846
00:56:52,285 --> 00:56:56,557
Can I wish that for Lady Viola
except in my dreams?

847
00:56:56,598 --> 00:57:00,231
And yet I would if I were free to follow
my desire in the harsh light of day.

848
00:57:00,272 --> 00:57:02,720
You follow your desire freely enough
in the night.

849
00:57:02,759 --> 00:57:05,997
-So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
-Then I’ll go with you.

850
00:57:06,037 --> 00:57:08,998
-You cannot. Wessex will kill you.
-I know how to fight.

851
00:57:08,999 --> 00:57:10,999
Stage fighting.

852
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,080
Oh, Will.

853
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,999
As Thomas Kent,
my heart belongs to you...

854
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,200
but as Viola,
the river divides us...

855
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:24,200
and I must marry Wessex
a week from Saturday.

856
00:57:24,281 --> 00:57:27,082
I’ll drag her down
by the queen’s command!

857
00:57:29,882 --> 00:57:31,801
Good morning, my Lord.

858
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:36,722
My lady. The tide waits for no man,
but I swear it would wait for you.

859
00:57:36,802 --> 00:57:40,201
Oh, here we come at last, my lord!

860
00:57:40,281 --> 00:57:42,642
Are you bringing your laundrywoman?

861
00:57:44,922 --> 00:57:47,601
Her chaperone,
my lady’s country cousin.

862
00:57:47,602 --> 00:57:52,705
My, but you be a handsome gallant,
just as she said.

863
00:57:52,745 --> 00:57:54,759
You may call me Miss Wilhelmina.

864
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:58,163
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps.

865
00:57:58,243 --> 00:58:00,963
Oh, my Lord, you will not shake me off.

866
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:05,483
Aye, she never needed me more.
I swear by your britches.

867
00:58:36,865 --> 00:58:38,455
-Now?
-Now.

868
00:58:39,085 --> 00:58:41,965
The queen asks for you.
Answer well.

869
00:58:44,766 --> 00:58:47,044
-Is there a man?
-A man, my lord?

870
00:58:47,045 --> 00:58:50,564
There was a man, a poet.
A theater poet, I think.

871
00:58:50,565 --> 00:58:53,326
-Does he come to the house?
-A theater poet?

872
00:58:53,406 --> 00:58:56,846
An insolent penny-a-page rogue!
Marlowe, he said. Christopher Marlowe.

873
00:58:56,847 --> 00:58:59,047
-Has he been to the house?
-Marlowe?

874
00:58:59,127 --> 00:59:01,326
Oh, yes. He is the one.

875
00:59:01,406 --> 00:59:04,767
Lovely waistcoat.
Shame about the poetry.

876
00:59:04,887 --> 00:59:07,447
That dog!

877
00:59:22,568 --> 00:59:24,488
Your Majesty.

878
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,849
Stand up straight, girl.

879
00:59:31,369 --> 00:59:33,168
I’ve seen you.

880
00:59:33,288 --> 00:59:36,928
You are the one who comes to all
the plays at Whitehall, at Richmond.

881
00:59:36,929 --> 00:59:39,369
Your Majesty.

882
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:42,319
What do you love so much?

883
00:59:42,609 --> 00:59:45,880
-Your Majesty...
-Speak up, girl, I know who I am!

884
00:59:46,409 --> 00:59:49,519
Do you love stories
of kings and queens...

885
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:53,951
of feats of arms,
or is it courtly love?

886
00:59:53,989 --> 00:59:55,891
I love theater.

887
00:59:55,916 --> 00:59:59,090
To have stories acted for me
by a company of fellows is indeed...

888
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:02,673
They’re not acted for you;
they are acted for me. And?

889
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:08,571
-And I love poetry above all.
-Above Lord Wessex?

890
01:00:09,391 --> 01:00:13,491
My lord, when you cannot find your wife,
you better look for her at the playhouse.

891
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:18,570
Playwrights teach us
nothing about love.

892
01:00:18,611 --> 01:00:21,930
They make it pretty; they make
it comical; or they make it lust.

893
01:00:21,931 --> 01:00:25,073
-They cannot make it true.
-Oh, but they can.

894
01:00:28,812 --> 01:00:33,772
I mean, Your Majesty, they...
they do not, they have... not...

895
01:00:33,853 --> 01:00:36,538
but I believe
there is one who can.

896
01:00:37,013 --> 01:00:41,308
My Lady Viola is young in the world.
Your Majesty is wise in it.

897
01:00:41,348 --> 01:00:43,982
Nature and truth
are the very enemies of playacting.

898
01:00:44,023 --> 01:00:48,013
-I’ll wager my fortune.
-I thought you were here because you had none.

899
01:00:53,414 --> 01:00:57,453
-Well, no one will take your wager, it seems.
-50 pounds.

900
01:01:00,014 --> 01:01:01,814
50 pounds?

901
01:01:03,294 --> 01:01:08,013
A very worthy sum on a very worthy question.

902
01:01:08,094 --> 01:01:12,737
Can a play show us the very truth
and nature of love?

903
01:01:13,094 --> 01:01:16,216
I bear witness to the wager...

904
01:01:16,295 --> 01:01:19,718
and will be the judge of it
as occasion arises.

905
01:01:21,895 --> 01:01:24,495
I have seen nothing
to settle it yet.

906
01:01:25,376 --> 01:01:27,855
Are there no more fireworks?

907
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:32,204
They would be soothing after the
excitements of Lady Viola’s audience.

908
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:35,817
Have her, then,
but you are a lordly fool.

909
01:01:35,896 --> 01:01:39,776
She’s been plucked since I saw her last,
and not by you.

910
01:01:39,777 --> 01:01:42,577
It takes a woman to know it.

911
01:01:46,056 --> 01:01:47,897
Marlowe.

912
01:01:58,377 --> 01:02:00,218
Burbage?

913
01:02:00,297 --> 01:02:03,057
Huh? Who’s there?

914
01:02:03,138 --> 01:02:05,698
Marlowe.

915
01:02:07,178 --> 01:02:09,217
You are playing my Dr. Faustus this afternoon.

916
01:02:09,218 --> 01:02:11,339
Don’t spend yourself in sport.

917
01:02:11,418 --> 01:02:14,937
-What do you want, Kit?
-My "Massacre at Paris" is complete.

918
01:02:14,938 --> 01:02:18,177
-What? You have the last act?
-If you have the money.

919
01:02:18,178 --> 01:02:22,098
-Tomorrow.
-Then tomorrow you shall have the pages.

920
01:02:22,179 --> 01:02:24,379
Oh, will you desist, madam!

921
01:02:24,459 --> 01:02:27,260
-Oh!
-20 pounds on delivery.

922
01:02:27,299 --> 01:02:30,499
Now, what is money to men like us?

923
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:36,140
Besides, if I need a play, I have another
waiting... a comedy by Shakespeare.

924
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:38,019
Oh, "Romeo".

925
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:41,179
-Gave it to Henslowe.
-Never!

926
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:44,219
Well, I’m to Deptford.
I leave you my respects, Miss Rosaline.

927
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:47,220
I gave Shakespeare
2 sovereigns for "Romeo".

928
01:02:47,301 --> 01:02:51,620
You did, but Ned Alleyn and the Admiral’s Men
have the playing of it at the "Rose".

929
01:02:51,621 --> 01:02:53,500
Treachery!

930
01:02:54,781 --> 01:02:56,940
Traitor and thief!

931
01:02:59,741 --> 01:03:01,901
Oh, no.

932
01:03:01,941 --> 01:03:03,902
No!

933
01:03:20,942 --> 01:03:23,021
<i>By my head, here comes the Capulets.</i>

934
01:03:23,022 --> 01:03:25,823
<i>By my heel, I care not.</i>

935
01:03:26,903 --> 01:03:29,142
<i>Follow me close.
I will speak with them.</i>

936
01:03:29,143 --> 01:03:32,097
<i>Gentlemen, good-den!
A word with one of you.</i>

937
01:03:32,143 --> 01:03:34,303
Are you going to do it like that?

938
01:03:34,383 --> 01:03:36,503
Positions.

939
01:03:36,583 --> 01:03:40,782
<i>-By my head, here comes the Capulets.
-By my heel, I care not.</i>

940
01:03:40,783 --> 01:03:43,022
<i>Follow me close.
I will speak to them.</i>

941
01:03:43,023 --> 01:03:45,872
<i>Gentlemen, good-den!
A word with one of you.</i>

942
01:03:46,104 --> 01:03:49,185
<i>And but one word with one of us?</i>

943
01:03:49,265 --> 01:03:51,983
<i>Couple it with something;
make it a word and a blow.</i>

944
01:03:51,984 --> 01:03:55,663
Where’s that thieving hack that
can’t keep his pen in his own ink pot?

945
01:03:55,664 --> 01:03:57,704
What is this rabble?

946
01:03:59,944 --> 01:04:02,625
Draw, if you be a man!

947
01:04:24,707 --> 01:04:26,986
Wonderful.
Wonderful!

948
01:04:27,826 --> 01:04:31,106
And a dog.

949
01:04:32,627 --> 01:04:34,507
No!

950
01:04:34,587 --> 01:04:37,707
Have privy, players! Please!

951
01:04:37,787 --> 01:04:40,547
Oh! Not with my props!

952
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:41,988
Oh!

953
01:04:42,067 --> 01:04:44,868
-Will! What...
-A writer’s quarrel.

954
01:04:44,948 --> 01:04:47,227
Quite normal.

955
01:04:48,588 --> 01:04:50,628
Stay here.

956
01:05:02,801 --> 01:05:04,349
You are hurt.

957
01:05:16,790 --> 01:05:20,110
I dreamed last night
of a shipwreck.

958
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:24,910
-You were cast ashore in a far country.
-Oh, not yet. Not yet.

959
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:27,949
Hey, we need that
for the balcony scene.

960
01:05:27,950 --> 01:05:30,149
My investment!
Lambert!

961
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:33,670
Vengeance!

962
01:06:00,032 --> 01:06:01,991
A famous victory!

963
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:05,992
Kegs and legs open,
and on the house!

964
01:06:06,112 --> 01:06:08,110
Oh, what happy hour.

965
01:06:08,192 --> 01:06:11,238
-This is a tavern!
-It is also a tavern.

966
01:06:11,278 --> 01:06:15,888
-I remember you. The poet!
-Yes, William the Conqueror.

967
01:06:16,313 --> 01:06:18,954
One at a time.
One at a time.

968
01:06:19,033 --> 01:06:23,391
Oh, he’s a pretty one. Tell me
your story while I tickle your fancy.

969
01:06:26,714 --> 01:06:30,393
-It’s a house of ill repute.
-It is, Thomas, but of good reputation.

970
01:06:30,394 --> 01:06:33,153
Come.
There’s no harm in a drink.

971
01:06:33,234 --> 01:06:37,835
You are welcome to my best house.
Here’s to the Admiral’s Men.

972
01:06:37,914 --> 01:06:39,633
-The Admiral’s Men!
-The Admiral’s Men!

973
01:06:39,634 --> 01:06:41,474
The Admiral’s Men!

974
01:07:03,676 --> 01:07:06,796
Well, I... I quite liked it.

975
01:07:06,876 --> 01:07:08,267
Master Kent...

976
01:07:08,997 --> 01:07:11,996
you have not yet dipped your wick.

977
01:07:13,414 --> 01:07:15,500
My wick?

978
01:07:15,996 --> 01:07:20,116
Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theater,
you must have a part in my play.

979
01:07:20,117 --> 01:07:24,877
I am writing an apothecary,
a small but vital role.

980
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:27,917
My heavens.
I thank you.

981
01:07:27,997 --> 01:07:30,197
What’s the play about, then?

982
01:07:30,278 --> 01:07:32,358
Well, there’s this nurse...

983
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:39,630
Silence, silence, silence!

984
01:07:40,318 --> 01:07:46,798
Master Shakespeare has asked me
to play the part of the apothecary.

985
01:07:48,599 --> 01:07:50,925
The apothecary?

986
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:54,399
Will, what is this story?
Where is the shipwreck?

987
01:07:54,479 --> 01:07:56,559
How does the comedy end?

988
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:00,758
-By God, I wish I knew.
-By God, if you do not, who does?

989
01:08:00,759 --> 01:08:04,319
Let us have pirates,
clowns and a happy ending...

990
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:08,301
or we shall send you
back to Stratford to your wife.

991
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:26,481
Will! Mr. Henslowe! Gentlemen all!

992
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:30,280
A black day for us all!
There is news from a tavern in Deptford.

993
01:08:30,281 --> 01:08:32,601
Marlowe is dead.

994
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:38,602
Stabbed.

995
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:42,881
Stabbed to death
in a tavern at Deptford.

996
01:08:45,122 --> 01:08:47,072
What have I done?

997
01:08:47,643 --> 01:08:50,362
He was the first man among us.

998
01:08:50,442 --> 01:08:53,003
A great light has gone out.

999
01:09:08,123 --> 01:09:10,083
Forgive me.

1000
01:09:13,004 --> 01:09:15,164
God forgive me.

1001
01:09:40,645 --> 01:09:43,685
...Our Lord
Jesus Christ’s sake.

1002
01:09:43,766 --> 01:09:46,086
~One morning in the month of May~

1003
01:09:46,166 --> 01:09:49,086
~From my cot I stray~

1004
01:09:49,165 --> 01:09:51,726
~Just at the dawning of the day~

1005
01:09:51,806 --> 01:09:54,287
~I met with a charming maid~

1006
01:09:56,126 --> 01:09:59,726
You look sad, my lady.
Let me take you riding.

1007
01:09:59,807 --> 01:10:03,646
-It’s not my riding day, my lord.
-Bless me, I thought it was a horse.

1008
01:10:04,229 --> 01:10:05,687
I’m going to church.

1009
01:10:05,767 --> 01:10:09,326
Of course. I understand.
It is to be expected.

1010
01:10:09,408 --> 01:10:12,687
Yes, it is to be expected...
on Sunday.

1011
01:10:12,767 --> 01:10:15,927
And on a day of mourning.

1012
01:10:16,008 --> 01:10:19,008
I never met the fellow
but once at your house.

1013
01:10:19,088 --> 01:10:21,007
Mourning?

1014
01:10:22,688 --> 01:10:25,329
Who is dead, my lord?

1015
01:10:25,408 --> 01:10:30,129
Oh! Dear God, I did not think
it would be me to tell you.

1016
01:10:30,209 --> 01:10:34,649
Great loss to playwriting
and to dancing.

1017
01:10:35,729 --> 01:10:37,569
My lady.

1018
01:10:37,649 --> 01:10:41,169
-He is dead?
-Killed last night in a tavern.

1019
01:10:42,729 --> 01:10:46,167
Come then.
We’ll say a prayer for his soul.

1020
01:10:50,049 --> 01:10:56,471
~Who can remember sorrow~

1021
01:11:28,052 --> 01:11:32,933
Spare me, dear ghost.

1022
01:11:33,012 --> 01:11:36,427
Spare me, for the love of Christ.
Spare me!

1023
01:11:49,374 --> 01:11:50,574
Will!

1024
01:11:51,653 --> 01:11:53,453
Oh, my love.

1025
01:11:54,204 --> 01:11:56,218
I thought you were dead.

1026
01:12:00,494 --> 01:12:02,294
It is worse.

1027
01:12:03,174 --> 01:12:05,174
I’ve killed a man.

1028
01:12:09,334 --> 01:12:12,134
Marlowe’s touch
was in my "Titus Andronicus"...

1029
01:12:12,135 --> 01:12:15,615
and my "Henry 6th" was a house built
on his foundations.

1030
01:12:16,695 --> 01:12:19,254
You never spoke so well of him.

1031
01:12:19,255 --> 01:12:21,453
He was not dead before.

1032
01:12:22,335 --> 01:12:27,313
I would exchange all my plays to come
for all of his that will never come.

1033
01:12:28,176 --> 01:12:30,255
You lie.

1034
01:12:31,856 --> 01:12:35,856
You lie by this river
as you lied in my bed.

1035
01:12:35,936 --> 01:12:38,295
My love is no lie.

1036
01:12:39,416 --> 01:12:41,856
I have a wife, yes...

1037
01:12:41,936 --> 01:12:45,135
and I cannot marry the daughter
of Sir Robert De Lesseps.

1038
01:12:45,136 --> 01:12:50,016
You needed no wife come from Stratford
to tell you that...

1039
01:12:50,017 --> 01:12:52,977
and yet, you let me come to your bed.

1040
01:12:53,057 --> 01:12:56,177
Calf-love.

1041
01:12:56,257 --> 01:13:00,497
I loved the writer and gave up
the prize for a sonnet.

1042
01:13:00,577 --> 01:13:03,218
I was the more deceived.

1043
01:13:03,298 --> 01:13:06,099
Yes, you were deceived...

1044
01:13:06,178 --> 01:13:09,417
for I did not know
how much I loved you.

1045
01:13:11,938 --> 01:13:14,898
I love you, Will...

1046
01:13:14,979 --> 01:13:16,978
beyond poetry.

1047
01:13:17,058 --> 01:13:19,458
Oh, my love.

1048
01:13:19,539 --> 01:13:23,471
-You ran from me before.
-When I thought you dead, I did not care...

1049
01:13:23,499 --> 01:13:25,700
about all the plays
that would never come...

1050
01:13:25,779 --> 01:13:28,458
only that I would
never see your face.

1051
01:13:28,459 --> 01:13:31,619
I saw our end and it will come.

1052
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:36,139
-You cannot marry Wessex.
-If not you, why not Wessex?

1053
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:38,699
If not Wessex, the queen
will know the cause...

1054
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:43,180
-and there will be no more Will Shakespeare.
-No. No.

1055
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:47,540
But I will go to Wessex
as a widow from these vows...

1056
01:13:47,661 --> 01:13:50,567
as solemn as they
are unsanctified.

1057
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:55,180
For killing Juliet’s
kinsman Tybalt...

1058
01:13:55,181 --> 01:13:57,929
the one who killed
Romeo’s friend Mercutio...

1059
01:13:57,994 --> 01:14:01,569
Romeo is banished. But the friar
who married Romeo and Juliet...

1060
01:14:01,609 --> 01:14:02,580
Is that me?

1061
01:14:02,581 --> 01:14:07,340
You, Edward. The friar who married
them gives Juliet a potion to drink.

1062
01:14:07,341 --> 01:14:10,986
It is a secret potion.
It makes us seeming dead.

1063
01:14:11,021 --> 01:14:13,862
She is placed in the tomb of the Capulets.

1064
01:14:13,942 --> 01:14:17,396
She will awake to life and love
when Romeo comes to her side again.

1065
01:14:19,422 --> 01:14:21,622
I have not said all.

1066
01:14:22,662 --> 01:14:28,400
By maligned fate, the message goes astray
which would tell Romeo of the friar’s plan.

1067
01:14:28,425 --> 01:14:31,583
He hears only that Juliet is dead.

1068
01:14:32,189 --> 01:14:35,381
-And thus he goes to the apothecary...
-That’s me.

1069
01:14:35,421 --> 01:14:38,142
...and buys a deadly poison.

1070
01:14:38,143 --> 01:14:40,833
He enters the tomb to say farewell
to Juliet...

1071
01:14:40,834 --> 01:14:43,198
who lies there cold as death.

1072
01:14:43,597 --> 01:14:46,219
He drinks the poison.

1073
01:14:46,584 --> 01:14:49,596
He dies by her side...

1074
01:14:50,184 --> 01:14:53,784
and then she wakes
and sees him dead.

1075
01:14:54,381 --> 01:14:58,200
And so Juliet takes his dagger...

1076
01:14:58,545 --> 01:15:00,047
and then kills herself.

1077
01:15:04,385 --> 01:15:07,385
Well, that will have them
rolling in the aisles.

1078
01:15:07,466 --> 01:15:10,225
Sad... and wonderful.

1079
01:15:11,345 --> 01:15:14,144
I have a blue velvet cap
that’ll do well.

1080
01:15:14,145 --> 01:15:18,785
I’ve seen just such a cap
on an apothecary. Just so.

1081
01:15:19,986 --> 01:15:22,946
Yes, it will serve.

1082
01:15:24,786 --> 01:15:27,186
But there’s a scene missing.

1083
01:15:27,776 --> 01:15:30,576
Between marriage and death?

1084
01:15:35,987 --> 01:15:39,907
The play...
all written out for you.

1085
01:15:41,387 --> 01:15:43,986
I had the clerk at Bridewell do it.

1086
01:15:43,987 --> 01:15:46,307
He has a good fist for lettering.

1087
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:51,016
There is a new scene.

1088
01:15:56,059 --> 01:15:57,988
Will you read in for me?

1089
01:15:58,035 --> 01:16:01,171
<i>Wilt thou be gone?
It’s not yet near day.</i>

1090
01:16:02,025 --> 01:16:03,669
<i>It was the nightingale, and not the lark...</i>

1091
01:16:03,748 --> 01:16:06,308
<i>that pierced the fearful hollow
of thine ear.</i>

1092
01:16:06,309 --> 01:16:12,092
<i>Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree.
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.</i>

1093
01:16:12,149 --> 01:16:16,029
<i>It was the lark,
the herald of the morn...</i>

1094
01:16:16,109 --> 01:16:18,350
<i>no nightingale.</i>

1095
01:16:18,429 --> 01:16:21,308
<i>Look, love,
what envious streaks...</i>

1096
01:16:21,309 --> 01:16:25,270
<i>do lace the severing clouds
in yonder east.</i>

1097
01:16:25,349 --> 01:16:29,030
<i>Night’s candles are burnt out...</i>

1098
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:34,750
<i>and jocund day stands tiptoe
on the misty mountaintops.</i>

1099
01:16:34,831 --> 01:16:39,343
<i>I must be gone and live,
or stay and die.</i>

1100
01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:44,671
<i>Yon light is not daylight;
I know it, I.</i>

1101
01:16:44,751 --> 01:16:47,591
<i>It is some meteor
that the sun exhales...</i>

1102
01:16:47,671 --> 01:16:52,152
<i>to be to thee this night a torchbearer...</i>

1103
01:16:52,231 --> 01:16:55,312
<i>to light thee on thy way to Mantua.</i>

1104
01:16:56,911 --> 01:17:02,512
<i>Therefore, stay yet.
Thou needst not to be gone.</i>

1105
01:17:02,632 --> 01:17:07,832
<i>Let me be ta'en,
let me be put to death.</i>

1106
01:17:07,912 --> 01:17:12,033
<i>I am content, so thou wilt have it so.</i>

1107
01:17:12,153 --> 01:17:16,993
<i>I have more care to stay...
than will to go.</i>

1108
01:17:17,073 --> 01:17:22,314
<i>Come, death, and welcome.
Juliet wills it so.</i>

1109
01:17:44,315 --> 01:17:47,275
You will go far, I fear.

1110
01:17:51,075 --> 01:17:53,475
I hope we work together again.

1111
01:17:55,781 --> 01:18:01,096
<i>Such mortal drugs I have,
but Mantua’s law is death...</i>

1112
01:18:01,097 --> 01:18:03,395
<i>death to any he that utters them.</i>

1113
01:18:03,610 --> 01:18:06,368
Then him. Then me.

1114
01:18:06,393 --> 01:18:10,556
<i>Put this in any liquid thing you will and...</i>

1115
01:18:10,676 --> 01:18:14,717
What is it? What is it?

1116
01:18:14,796 --> 01:18:18,596
<i>How silver sweet sound
lovers" tongues by night.</i>

1117
01:18:18,635 --> 01:18:20,740
<i>-Like soft music...
-Shakespeare!</i>

1118
01:18:37,237 --> 01:18:40,060
Upstart inky pup!

1119
01:18:40,198 --> 01:18:43,037
I’ll show you your place,
which is in hell!

1120
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:50,518
-You’re on my ground now!
-By God, I’ll fight the lot of you!

1121
01:18:50,519 --> 01:18:52,359
I am more than enough!

1122
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,799
Move!

1123
01:20:20,411 --> 01:20:22,811
Absent friends.

1124
01:20:24,009 --> 01:20:27,010
This is the murderer of Kit Marlowe!

1125
01:20:27,605 --> 01:20:28,805
Will?

1126
01:20:28,845 --> 01:20:32,603
I rejoiced in his death because I thought
it was yours! That is all I know of Marlowe!

1127
01:20:32,604 --> 01:20:36,044
Will? Uh, it’s true.

1128
01:20:36,125 --> 01:20:38,805
It was a... tavern brawl.

1129
01:20:38,885 --> 01:20:43,645
Marlowe attacked
and got his own knife in the eye.

1130
01:20:43,725 --> 01:20:45,886
A quarrel about the bill.

1131
01:20:45,925 --> 01:20:49,127
The bill?
Oh, vanity, vanity!

1132
01:20:49,166 --> 01:20:52,380
Not the billing,
the bill!

1133
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:59,766
-Oh, God. I am free of it.
-Where is she?

1134
01:21:01,609 --> 01:21:03,848
-Close it.
-My Lord Wessex.

1135
01:21:03,888 --> 01:21:06,967
The Rose harbors the ass
that shits on my name!

1136
01:21:07,046 --> 01:21:09,167
Take it down stone by stone.

1137
01:21:09,247 --> 01:21:12,887
I want it plowed into the ground
and sown with quicklime!

1138
01:21:12,888 --> 01:21:14,766
Mr. Tilney, what is this?

1139
01:21:14,767 --> 01:21:17,167
Sedition and indecency.

1140
01:21:17,168 --> 01:21:19,769
Master of the Revels, sir.
She’s over here.

1141
01:21:19,848 --> 01:21:22,368
-Where, boy?
-There.

1142
01:21:22,448 --> 01:21:24,528
I saw her bubbies.

1143
01:21:24,608 --> 01:21:28,809
So, a woman on the stage!

1144
01:21:28,888 --> 01:21:32,848
A woman!
I say this theater is closed!

1145
01:21:32,929 --> 01:21:34,328
Why, sir?

1146
01:21:34,408 --> 01:21:38,369
For lewdness and unashamed faced ness!

1147
01:21:38,448 --> 01:21:43,128
And for displaying a female
on the public stage!

1148
01:21:57,610 --> 01:21:59,570
Not him, her!

1149
01:22:03,192 --> 01:22:04,958
That’s who I meant.

1150
01:22:06,931 --> 01:22:10,290
-He’s a woman.
-This theater is closed.

1151
01:22:12,131 --> 01:22:15,411
Notice will be posted!

1152
01:22:15,491 --> 01:22:18,331
Ned, I swear, I knew nothing of this.

1153
01:22:18,411 --> 01:22:21,171
-Nobody knew.
-He did.

1154
01:22:21,251 --> 01:22:24,131
I saw him kissing her bubbies.

1155
01:22:26,492 --> 01:22:28,530
It is over.

1156
01:22:29,212 --> 01:22:32,212
I’m sorry, Mr. Henslowe.

1157
01:22:46,001 --> 01:22:48,271
I wanted to be an actor.

1158
01:22:49,614 --> 01:22:51,614
I’m so sorry, Will.

1159
01:22:57,093 --> 01:23:00,053
You were... w-w...

1160
01:23:01,254 --> 01:23:03,374
w-wonderful.

1161
01:23:04,934 --> 01:23:07,054
Thank you.

1162
01:23:15,335 --> 01:23:19,415
<i>Put this in any liquid thing you will
and...</i>

1163
01:23:25,575 --> 01:23:28,016
Everything all right?

1164
01:24:03,617 --> 01:24:06,217
I would’ve been good.

1165
01:24:07,137 --> 01:24:10,058
-I would’ve been great.
-So would I.

1166
01:24:10,178 --> 01:24:12,459
We both would.

1167
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:36,180
Lambert, kill him.

1168
01:24:37,459 --> 01:24:39,659
That can wait.

1169
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:48,762
The Master of the Revels despises us all
for vagrants and peddlers of bombast.

1170
01:24:49,740 --> 01:24:51,860
But my father, James Burbage...

1171
01:24:51,861 --> 01:24:56,141
had the first license to make a company
of players from Her Majesty...

1172
01:24:56,221 --> 01:25:00,741
and he drew from poets
the literature of the age.

1173
01:25:00,821 --> 01:25:04,182
We must show them
that we are men of parts.

1174
01:25:04,261 --> 01:25:06,820
Will Shakespeare has a play.

1175
01:25:07,621 --> 01:25:11,902
I have a theater.
The "Curtain" is yours.

1176
01:25:43,904 --> 01:25:47,304
Will!
We’ll be needing a Romeo.

1177
01:25:53,744 --> 01:25:55,784
Oranges! Sweet oranges!

1178
01:26:22,426 --> 01:26:24,293
My ship is moored at bank side...

1179
01:26:24,294 --> 01:26:27,187
bound for Virginia
on the afternoon tide.

1180
01:26:27,230 --> 01:26:30,467
Please do not weep, Lady De Lesseps.
You are gaining a colony.

1181
01:26:30,547 --> 01:26:35,747
And you, my lord, are gaining 5,000 pounds
by these drafts in my hand.

1182
01:26:35,826 --> 01:26:38,467
Would you oblige me with 50 or so in gold...

1183
01:26:38,547 --> 01:26:41,507
just to settle my accounts
at the dockside?

1184
01:26:42,747 --> 01:26:45,508
Ah, the bride!

1185
01:26:46,707 --> 01:26:49,508
Good morning, my lord.

1186
01:26:49,588 --> 01:26:53,875
I see you are... open for business,
so let’s to church.

1187
01:26:59,201 --> 01:27:00,228
Be gone!

1188
01:27:56,232 --> 01:27:58,072
Oh, my lord!

1189
01:27:58,151 --> 01:28:00,632
-Be good to her, my lord.
-I will.

1190
01:28:00,712 --> 01:28:02,712
Oh, God bless you!

1191
01:28:02,791 --> 01:28:05,513
Thank you. Uh, let go.
There’s a good nurse.

1192
01:28:05,592 --> 01:28:07,472
The tide will not wait!

1193
01:28:07,553 --> 01:28:11,272
Farewell!
You’ll all be welcome in Virginia!

1194
01:28:36,714 --> 01:28:41,195
Candy apples!

1195
01:28:41,274 --> 01:28:44,674
Buy my apples!

1196
01:28:48,995 --> 01:28:51,115
Thank you, sir.
Apples!

1197
01:28:58,315 --> 01:29:01,555
Is this, uh...
Is this all right?

1198
01:29:01,635 --> 01:29:03,476
Yeah.

1199
01:29:18,157 --> 01:29:22,277
Licentiousness is made a show!
Vice is made a show!

1200
01:29:22,397 --> 01:29:26,757
Vanity and pride
likewise made a show!

1201
01:29:26,838 --> 01:29:31,597
This is the very business of show!

1202
01:29:40,358 --> 01:29:44,718
T- T- T- Two...

1203
01:29:44,798 --> 01:29:47,318
T- T- T- T... T... T...

1204
01:29:47,399 --> 01:29:50,919
T... T- T- Two households...

1205
01:29:50,999 --> 01:29:53,799
-We’re lost.
-No, it will turn out well.

1206
01:29:53,919 --> 01:29:57,198
-How will it?
-I don’t know. It’s a mystery.

1207
01:29:59,639 --> 01:30:02,999
T- T... T... T- T...

1208
01:30:03,119 --> 01:30:05,320
T... T...

1209
01:30:54,523 --> 01:30:56,963
Two households...

1210
01:30:57,043 --> 01:31:00,043
both alike in dignity...

1211
01:31:00,124 --> 01:31:02,762
in fair Verona...

1212
01:31:02,843 --> 01:31:05,323
where we lay our scene.

1213
01:31:05,403 --> 01:31:08,364
From ancient grudge break
to new mutiny...

1214
01:31:08,403 --> 01:31:11,683
where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

1215
01:31:11,723 --> 01:31:14,643
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes...

1216
01:31:14,684 --> 01:31:17,724
a pair of star-crossed lovers
take their life...

1217
01:31:17,764 --> 01:31:20,444
whose misadventured,
piteous overthrows...

1218
01:31:20,484 --> 01:31:23,805
doth with their death
bury their parents" strife.

1219
01:31:26,844 --> 01:31:29,804
...the which of you
with patient ears attend...

1220
01:31:29,885 --> 01:31:34,444
what here shall miss,
our toil shall strive to mend.

1221
01:31:40,525 --> 01:31:42,445
-Wonderful.
-Was it...

1222
01:31:43,526 --> 01:31:45,485
good?

1223
01:31:48,126 --> 01:31:51,167
<i>Gregory, on my word
we’ll not carry coals.</i>

1224
01:31:51,246 --> 01:31:54,166
<i>No, for then
we should be colliers.</i>

1225
01:31:54,246 --> 01:31:56,647
<i>I mean, and we be
in choler we’ll draw.</i>

1226
01:31:56,726 --> 01:31:59,686
-Master Shakespeare.
-Luck be with you, Sam. Sam!

1227
01:31:59,767 --> 01:32:02,853
It’s not my fault.
I could do it yesterday.

1228
01:32:02,878 --> 01:32:05,247
Do me a speech. Do me a line.

1229
01:32:05,326 --> 01:32:09,007
<i>Parting is such sweet sorrow.</i>

1230
01:32:09,087 --> 01:32:12,207
-Another little problem.
-What do we do now?

1231
01:32:12,288 --> 01:32:16,047
-The show must... You know.
-Go on!

1232
01:32:16,128 --> 01:32:19,408
Juliet does not come on for 20 pages.
It will be all right.

1233
01:32:19,488 --> 01:32:21,807
-How will it?
-I don’t know. It’s a mystery.

1234
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:24,088
<i>-Fear me not.
-No, marry, I fear thee!</i>

1235
01:32:26,409 --> 01:32:29,168
<i>-Let them begin.
-I will frown as I pass by.</i>

1236
01:32:29,248 --> 01:32:32,888
<i>-Let them take it as they list!
-Nay, as they dare.</i>

1237
01:32:32,968 --> 01:32:36,849
<i>I will bite my thumb at them, which is
disgrace to them if they bear it.</i>

1238
01:32:36,928 --> 01:32:39,729
<i>Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir?</i>

1239
01:32:39,809 --> 01:32:42,969
<i>-I do bite my thumb, sir.
-Excuse me. Thank you.</i>

1240
01:32:43,049 --> 01:32:46,530
<i>-Thank you. Excuse me.
-Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</i>

1241
01:32:46,609 --> 01:32:48,369
-Can we talk?
-Shh!

1242
01:32:48,409 --> 01:32:51,151
-We have no Juliet.
-No Juliet?

1243
01:32:51,191 --> 01:32:53,970
-No Juliet?
-It’ll be all right, madam.

1244
01:32:54,010 --> 01:32:56,248
-What happened to Sam?
-Who are you?

1245
01:32:56,288 --> 01:32:58,088
Thomas Kent.

1246
01:32:58,512 --> 01:33:00,512
Do you know it?

1247
01:33:01,758 --> 01:33:03,758
Every word.

1248
01:33:12,850 --> 01:33:15,731
<i>I’ll go along,
no such sight to be shown...</i>

1249
01:33:15,811 --> 01:33:18,812
<i>but to rejoice in splendor
of mine own.</i>

1250
01:33:18,891 --> 01:33:21,091
<i>Nurse!</i>

1251
01:33:23,371 --> 01:33:26,492
<i>Where’s my daughter?
Call her forth to me.</i>

1252
01:33:26,572 --> 01:33:29,653
<i>Now, by my maidenhead
at 12 years old...</i>

1253
01:33:29,732 --> 01:33:31,572
<i>I bade her come.</i>

1254
01:33:31,652 --> 01:33:33,652
How now, who calls?

1255
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:36,372
<i>What, ladybird!</i>

1256
01:33:36,452 --> 01:33:38,133
<i>God forbid!
Where’s this girl?</i>

1257
01:33:38,212 --> 01:33:40,733
<i>What, lamb!</i>

1258
01:33:40,813 --> 01:33:42,933
<i>What, ladybird!</i>

1259
01:33:43,972 --> 01:33:46,293
<i>What, Juliet!</i>

1260
01:33:47,372 --> 01:33:50,613
<i>How now, who calls?</i>

1261
01:33:53,453 --> 01:33:57,854
-We’ll all be put in the Clink.
-See you in jail.

1262
01:34:00,854 --> 01:34:03,894
<i>Your mother...
Your mother.</i>

1263
01:34:03,973 --> 01:34:07,134
<i>Madam, I am here.
What is your will?</i>

1264
01:34:07,214 --> 01:34:09,174
<i>This is the matter.</i>

1265
01:34:09,255 --> 01:34:11,574
<i>Nurse, give leave a while.
We must talk in secret.</i>

1266
01:34:11,654 --> 01:34:16,215
<i>Nurse, come back again. I have
remembered me; thou's hear our counsel.</i>

1267
01:34:16,295 --> 01:34:19,494
<i>Thou knowest my daughter’s
of a pretty age.</i>

1268
01:34:19,575 --> 01:34:22,935
<i>-Faith, I know her age unto an hour.
-She’s not 14.</i>

1269
01:34:23,015 --> 01:34:28,296
<i>Oh, I’ll lay 14 of my teeth.
And yet my teen be it spoken...</i>

1270
01:34:28,375 --> 01:34:31,015
<i>I have but 4.</i>

1271
01:34:52,297 --> 01:34:54,257
<i>Tell me, daughter Juliet...</i>

1272
01:34:54,336 --> 01:34:58,737
<i>how stands your dispositions
to be married?</i>

1273
01:34:58,817 --> 01:35:01,818
<i>It is an honor
that I dream not of.</i>

1274
01:35:05,938 --> 01:35:08,698
<i>Hold, Tybalt!
Good Mercutio!</i>

1275
01:35:17,631 --> 01:35:19,219
<i>I’m sped.</i>

1276
01:35:19,299 --> 01:35:21,979
<i>Courage, man;
the hurt cannot be much.</i>

1277
01:35:22,058 --> 01:35:27,139
<i>Ask for me tomorrow,
you shall find me a grave man.</i>

1278
01:35:34,059 --> 01:35:35,059
<i>Yes!</i>

1279
01:35:42,219 --> 01:35:43,219
<i>Yah!</i>

1280
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:46,620
<i>Such mortal drugs I have...</i>

1281
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:51,141
<i>but Mantua’s law is death
to any he that utters them.</i>

1282
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:53,660
Then him. Then me.

1283
01:36:01,820 --> 01:36:03,781
<i>Romeo, away, be gone!</i>

1284
01:36:03,901 --> 01:36:08,101
<i>The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amazed!</i>

1285
01:36:08,222 --> 01:36:12,261
<i>The prince will doom thee death if thou
art taken. Hence, be gone, away!</i>

1286
01:36:13,461 --> 01:36:15,662
<i>Oh, I am Fortune’s fool!</i>

1287
01:36:15,781 --> 01:36:17,582
<i>Why dost thou stay?</i>

1288
01:36:17,702 --> 01:36:19,582
<i>Which way ran he that killed Mercutio?</i>

1289
01:36:19,702 --> 01:36:21,783
<i>That murderer, which way ran he?</i>

1290
01:36:21,903 --> 01:36:24,543
<i>-There lies that Tybalt.
-Up, sir. Go with me.</i>

1291
01:36:24,662 --> 01:36:26,583
<i>I charge thee
in the Prince’s name obey.</i>

1292
01:36:26,703 --> 01:36:29,262
<i>Where are the vile beginners
of this fray?</i>

1293
01:36:29,383 --> 01:36:31,503
<i>Oh, I am Fortune’s fool.</i>

1294
01:36:34,223 --> 01:36:36,063
<i>You are married?</i>

1295
01:36:39,583 --> 01:36:44,383
<i>If you be married, my grave
is like to be my wedding bed.</i>

1296
01:36:59,505 --> 01:37:01,625
<i>Art thou gone so...</i>

1297
01:37:04,145 --> 01:37:06,185
<i>love, lord...</i>

1298
01:37:06,265 --> 01:37:08,385
<i>aye, husband, friend?</i>

1299
01:37:08,464 --> 01:37:13,026
<i>I must hear from thee
every day in the hour...</i>

1300
01:37:13,106 --> 01:37:15,905
<i>for in a minute
there are many days.</i>

1301
01:37:15,986 --> 01:37:19,426
<i>Oh, by this count
I shall be much in years ere again...</i>

1302
01:37:19,506 --> 01:37:21,826
<i>I behold my Romeo.</i>

1303
01:37:22,391 --> 01:37:23,746
<i>Farewell.</i>

1304
01:37:25,187 --> 01:37:28,572
<i>Oh, thinks thou we shall ever meet again?</i>

1305
01:37:29,947 --> 01:37:32,867
<i>Methinks I see thee,
now thou art so low...</i>

1306
01:37:32,947 --> 01:37:36,267
<i>as one dead in the bottom of a tomb.</i>

1307
01:37:36,347 --> 01:37:40,346
<i>Either my eyesight fails,
or thou look’s pale.</i>

1308
01:37:41,747 --> 01:37:43,867
<i>Then trust me, love...</i>

1309
01:37:43,948 --> 01:37:46,187
<i>in my eyes, so do you.</i>

1310
01:37:46,267 --> 01:37:49,868
<i>Dry sorrow
drinks our blood.</i>

1311
01:37:49,948 --> 01:37:51,789
<i>Adieu.</i>

1312
01:37:53,228 --> 01:37:55,749
<i>Adieu.</i>

1313
01:37:55,828 --> 01:37:58,468
<i>Take thou this vial,
being then in bed...</i>

1314
01:37:58,548 --> 01:38:01,509
<i>and this distilling liquor
drink thou off.</i>

1315
01:38:01,588 --> 01:38:05,388
<i>No warmth, no breath,
shall testify thou livest.</i>

1316
01:38:05,469 --> 01:38:08,309
<i>And in this borrowed likeness
of shrunk death...</i>

1317
01:38:08,389 --> 01:38:11,469
<i>thou shalt continue
2 and 40 hours...</i>

1318
01:38:11,550 --> 01:38:15,029
<i>and then awake
as from a pleasant sleep.</i>

1319
01:38:15,109 --> 01:38:17,109
<i>What ho! Apothecary!</i>

1320
01:38:20,469 --> 01:38:23,950
<i>Come hither, man.
I see that thou art poor.</i>

1321
01:38:24,030 --> 01:38:26,829
<i>Hold, there is 40 ducats.</i>

1322
01:38:26,911 --> 01:38:30,509
<i>-Let me have a dram of poison...
-Such mortal drugs I have...</i>

1323
01:38:30,590 --> 01:38:34,469
<i>but Mantua’s law is death
to any he that utters them.</i>

1324
01:38:34,550 --> 01:38:37,910
<i>-Art thou so...
-My poverty, but not my will, consents.</i>

1325
01:38:43,512 --> 01:38:46,510
<i>I pay thy poverty
and not thy will.</i>

1326
01:38:50,151 --> 01:38:52,231
<i>Eyes, look your last.</i>

1327
01:38:52,311 --> 01:38:54,952
<i>Arms, take your last embrace.</i>

1328
01:38:55,032 --> 01:39:00,671
<i>And, lips,
oh, you, the doors of breath...</i>

1329
01:39:00,752 --> 01:39:03,072
<i>seal with a righteous kiss...</i>

1330
01:39:04,952 --> 01:39:09,352
<i>the dateless bargain
to engrossing death.</i>

1331
01:39:10,593 --> 01:39:16,553
<i>Come, bitter conduct.
Come, unsavoury guide.</i>

1332
01:39:16,633 --> 01:39:20,193
<i>Thou, desperate pilot,
now at once...</i>

1333
01:39:20,273 --> 01:39:24,873
<i>run on the dashing rocks
thy seasick weary bark.</i>

1334
01:39:24,953 --> 01:39:27,273
<i>Here’s to my love!</i>

1335
01:39:34,874 --> 01:39:37,915
<i>Oh... true apothecary!</i>

1336
01:39:41,755 --> 01:39:43,914
<i>Thy drugs are quick.</i>

1337
01:39:48,515 --> 01:39:50,995
<i>Thus with a kiss...</i>

1338
01:39:53,596 --> 01:39:55,595
<i>I die.</i>

1339
01:40:12,596 --> 01:40:14,596
<i>Where is my lord?</i>

1340
01:40:16,276 --> 01:40:20,236
<i>I do remember well where I should be,
and there I am. Where is my Romeo?</i>

1341
01:40:20,317 --> 01:40:21,557
Dead!

1342
01:40:34,397 --> 01:40:36,358
<i>What’s this?</i>

1343
01:40:36,438 --> 01:40:39,997
<i>A cup, closed
in my true love’s hand?</i>

1344
01:40:41,612 --> 01:40:45,159
<i>Poison, I see,hath been
his timeless end.</i>

1345
01:40:50,598 --> 01:40:54,999
<i>Oh, happy dagger,
this is thy sheath.</i>

1346
01:40:57,839 --> 01:41:00,080
<i>There rust...</i>

1347
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:03,639
<i>and let me die.</i>

1348
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:13,680
<i>A glooming peace
this morning with it brings.</i>

1349
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:18,000
<i>The sun for sorrow
will not show his head.</i>

1350
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:22,840
<i>Go hence, to have more talk
of these sad things.</i>

1351
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:25,081
<i>Some shall be pardoned...</i>

1352
01:41:25,201 --> 01:41:28,081
<i>and some punished.</i>

1353
01:41:28,161 --> 01:41:32,121
<i>For never was a story
of more woe...</i>

1354
01:41:32,202 --> 01:41:35,642
<i>than this of Juliet...</i>

1355
01:41:35,762 --> 01:41:37,881
<i>and her Romeo.</i>

1356
01:42:03,923 --> 01:42:06,644
Bravo!

1357
01:42:10,243 --> 01:42:12,124
-Yea! Yea!
-Yea!

1358
01:42:56,646 --> 01:42:59,206
-Bravo!
-Yea! Bravo!

1359
01:43:13,086 --> 01:43:17,328
-God save the queen!
-I arrest you in the name of Queen Elizabeth!

1360
01:43:17,408 --> 01:43:21,248
Arrest who, Mr. Tilney?

1361
01:43:21,328 --> 01:43:23,008
Everyone!

1362
01:43:23,087 --> 01:43:26,288
Admiral’s Men,
the Chamberlain’s Men...

1363
01:43:26,368 --> 01:43:30,528
and every one of you ne'er-do-wells
that stand in contempt...

1364
01:43:30,609 --> 01:43:33,849
of the authority vested
in me by Her Majesty!

1365
01:43:33,928 --> 01:43:37,809
Contempt? You closed the "Rose".
I have not opened it.

1366
01:43:37,888 --> 01:43:40,288
That woman is a woman!

1367
01:43:40,368 --> 01:43:42,369
What?

1368
01:43:42,449 --> 01:43:45,530
A woman?
You mean that goat?

1369
01:43:45,609 --> 01:43:50,809
I’ll see you all in Clink, in the name
of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth!

1370
01:43:50,890 --> 01:43:54,089
Mr. Tilney!

1371
01:43:59,090 --> 01:44:02,690
Have a care with my name.
You will wear it out.

1372
01:44:10,210 --> 01:44:12,891
The queen of England
does not attend...

1373
01:44:12,971 --> 01:44:14,930
exhibitions of public lewdness.

1374
01:44:15,011 --> 01:44:17,891
So something is out of joint.

1375
01:44:19,730 --> 01:44:23,251
Come here, Master Kent.
Let me look at you.

1376
01:44:37,452 --> 01:44:40,253
Yes, the illusion is remarkable.

1377
01:44:40,332 --> 01:44:42,932
And your error, Mr. Tilney,
is easily forgiven.

1378
01:44:44,213 --> 01:44:48,053
But I know something of
a woman in a man’s profession.

1379
01:44:48,133 --> 01:44:50,973
Yes, by God,
I do know about that.

1380
01:44:52,653 --> 01:44:55,454
That is enough from you, Master Kent.

1381
01:45:00,094 --> 01:45:02,253
If only Lord Wessex were here.

1382
01:45:02,334 --> 01:45:04,294
He is, ma'am.

1383
01:45:07,094 --> 01:45:10,174
Y-Your Majesty.

1384
01:45:11,375 --> 01:45:14,254
There was a wager I remember...

1385
01:45:14,334 --> 01:45:18,976
as to whether a play could show
the very truth and nature of love.

1386
01:45:19,055 --> 01:45:21,535
I think you lost it today.

1387
01:45:26,015 --> 01:45:29,775
You are an eager boy.
Did you like the play?

1388
01:45:29,855 --> 01:45:32,656
I liked it when she stabbed herself,
Your Majesty.

1389
01:45:39,056 --> 01:45:41,376
Master Shakespeare.

1390
01:45:43,856 --> 01:45:46,737
Next time you come to Greenwich,
come as yourself...

1391
01:45:46,817 --> 01:45:49,817
and we will speak some more.

1392
01:46:06,577 --> 01:46:08,738
Your Majesty.

1393
01:46:10,098 --> 01:46:14,499
Why, Lord Wessex.
Lost your wife so soon?

1394
01:46:14,578 --> 01:46:17,218
Indeed I am a bride short...

1395
01:46:17,298 --> 01:46:21,819
and my ship sails for the new world
on the evening tide.

1396
01:46:22,182 --> 01:46:24,379
How is this to end?

1397
01:46:24,408 --> 01:46:29,476
As stories must when love’s denied,
with tears and a journey.

1398
01:46:30,396 --> 01:46:36,020
Those whom God has joined in marriage
not even I can put asunder.

1399
01:46:36,218 --> 01:46:37,820
Master Kent.

1400
01:46:43,300 --> 01:46:47,860
Lord Wessex, as I foretold,
has lost his wife in the playhouse.

1401
01:46:48,980 --> 01:46:52,620
Go make your farewell
and send her out.

1402
01:46:52,701 --> 01:46:55,060
It’s time to settle accounts.

1403
01:46:57,599 --> 01:47:01,022
-How much was that wager?
-50 shillings.

1404
01:47:02,301 --> 01:47:03,493
Pounds.

1405
01:47:04,822 --> 01:47:09,102
Give it to Master Kent.
He will see it rightfully home.

1406
01:47:16,383 --> 01:47:20,142
Tell Master Shakespeare
something more cheerful next time...

1407
01:47:20,262 --> 01:47:22,982
for "Twelfth Night".

1408
01:47:39,252 --> 01:47:41,652
Too late.
Too late.

1409
01:47:51,143 --> 01:47:53,144
My Lady Wessex.

1410
01:48:07,666 --> 01:48:10,545
A hired player no longer.

1411
01:48:10,665 --> 01:48:15,626
50 pounds, Will,
for the poet of true love.

1412
01:48:16,746 --> 01:48:19,024
I’m done with theater.

1413
01:48:20,306 --> 01:48:25,186
The playhouse is for dreamers.
Look what the dream brought us.

1414
01:48:26,306 --> 01:48:28,787
It was we ourselves did that.

1415
01:48:30,146 --> 01:48:34,186
And for my life to come,
I would not have it otherwise.

1416
01:48:34,307 --> 01:48:38,267
I have hurt you, and I’m sorry for it.

1417
01:48:38,387 --> 01:48:42,266
If my hurt is to be
that you write no more...

1418
01:48:42,347 --> 01:48:44,627
then I shall be the sorrier.

1419
01:48:49,987 --> 01:48:52,427
The queen commands
a comedy, Will...

1420
01:48:52,548 --> 01:48:57,428
-for "Twelfth Night".
-A comedy.

1421
01:48:57,548 --> 01:48:59,468
What would my hero be?

1422
01:48:59,508 --> 01:49:03,242
The saddest wretch in all the kingdom,
sick with love?

1423
01:49:04,988 --> 01:49:08,309
It’s a beginning.

1424
01:49:08,389 --> 01:49:12,308
Let him be a duke,
and your heroine...

1425
01:49:12,389 --> 01:49:15,590
Sold in marriage
and halfway to America.

1426
01:49:17,349 --> 01:49:21,389
At sea, then.
A voyage to a new world.

1427
01:49:21,469 --> 01:49:24,230
A storm.
All are lost.

1428
01:49:24,309 --> 01:49:27,630
She lands... on a...

1429
01:49:27,710 --> 01:49:30,590
vast and empty shore.

1430
01:49:31,990 --> 01:49:33,951
She’s brought to the duke...

1431
01:49:35,311 --> 01:49:38,230
-Orsino.
-Orsino?

1432
01:49:39,311 --> 01:49:41,150
Good name.

1433
01:49:41,232 --> 01:49:46,951
But fearful of her virtue,
she comes to him dressed as a boy.

1434
01:49:46,988 --> 01:49:50,170
And thus is unable
to declare her love.

1435
01:49:51,311 --> 01:49:53,432
But all ends well.

1436
01:49:53,512 --> 01:49:55,632
How does it?

1437
01:49:56,391 --> 01:49:57,752
I don’t know.

1438
01:49:59,272 --> 01:50:01,953
It’s a mystery.

1439
01:50:08,588 --> 01:50:11,152
You will never age for me...

1440
01:50:11,210 --> 01:50:14,633
nor fade, nor die.

1441
01:50:15,613 --> 01:50:17,613
Nor you for me.

1442
01:50:19,195 --> 01:50:21,395
Good-bye, my love.

1443
01:50:22,273 --> 01:50:24,474
A thousand times good-bye.

1444
01:50:29,416 --> 01:50:31,616
Write me well.

1445
01:51:02,115 --> 01:51:05,596
My story starts at sea...

1446
01:51:05,676 --> 01:51:09,425
a perilous voyage
to an unknown land.

1447
01:51:10,116 --> 01:51:12,316
A shipwreck.

1448
01:51:14,876 --> 01:51:18,516
The wild waters roar and heave.

1449
01:51:19,677 --> 01:51:22,796
The brave vessel is dashed all to pieces...

1450
01:51:25,437 --> 01:51:29,157
and all the helpless souls within her...

1451
01:51:29,237 --> 01:51:31,238
drowned.

1452
01:51:33,998 --> 01:51:37,157
All save one:

1453
01:51:37,238 --> 01:51:39,238
a lady...

1454
01:51:40,638 --> 01:51:43,596
whose soul is greater
than the ocean...

1455
01:51:44,798 --> 01:51:49,500
and her spirit stronger
than the sea’s embrace.

1456
01:51:51,119 --> 01:51:54,118
Not for her a watery end...

1457
01:51:55,599 --> 01:52:00,189
but a new life beginning
on a stranger shore.

1458
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:05,919
It will be a love story,

1459
01:52:09,879 --> 01:52:13,880
for she will be my heroine for all time.

1460
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:20,000
And her name will be Viola.

1461
01:52:38,781 --> 01:52:42,952
