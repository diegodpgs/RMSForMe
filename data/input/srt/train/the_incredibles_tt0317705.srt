1
00:00:33,206 --> 00:00:35,197
- Is this on?
- That's fine.

2
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:37,561
I can break through walls,
I just can't...

3
00:00:37,646 --> 00:00:39,716
- That's fine.
- I can't get this on.

4
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,125
So, Mr Incredible...

5
00:00:41,206 --> 00:00:45,324
...do you have a secret identity?
- Every superhero does.

6
00:00:45,406 --> 00:00:47,203
I don't know one who doesn't.

7
00:00:47,286 --> 00:00:50,005
Who wants the pressure
of being super all the time?

8
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,644
Yes, I have a secret identity.

9
00:00:53,726 --> 00:00:57,002
Can you see me in this
at the supermarket?

10
00:00:57,086 --> 00:00:59,725
Who'd want to go shopping as Elastigirl?

11
00:01:01,726 --> 00:01:05,321
Superladies are always trying
to tell you their secret identity.

12
00:01:05,406 --> 00:01:08,876
Think it'll strengthen the relationship.

13
00:01:08,966 --> 00:01:13,278
Girl, I don't want to know
about your mild-mannered alter ego.

14
00:01:13,366 --> 00:01:18,076
I mean, you tell me you're
a super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe,

15
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:22,000
that's all right with me. I'm good.

16
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:24,145
No matter how often
you save the world,

17
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:27,585
it always manages to get back
in jeopardy again.

18
00:01:27,669 --> 00:01:31,503
Sometimes I just want it to stay saved,
you know, for a little bit.

19
00:01:31,589 --> 00:01:34,262
I feel like the maid.
"I just cleaned up this mess."

20
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:36,738
"Can we keep it clean
for ten minutes?"

21
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:39,138
- I could get to that point.
- "Please?"

22
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:41,379
Don't get up. We're not finished.

23
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:44,700
Sometimes I think I'd just like
the simple life, you know.

24
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:47,144
Relax a little and raise a family.

25
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:50,221
Settle down? Are you kidding?
I'm at the top of my game.

26
00:01:50,309 --> 00:01:52,869
I'm up there with the big dogs.
Girls, come on.

27
00:01:52,949 --> 00:01:56,180
Leave the saving of the world
to the men? I don't think so.

28
00:01:57,069 --> 00:01:58,707
I don't think so.

29
00:02:15,415 --> 00:02:17,133
<i>Now an important bulletin.</i>

30
00:02:17,215 --> 00:02:20,366
<i>A pursuit between police</i>
<i>and armed gunmen is underway,</i>

31
00:02:20,455 --> 00:02:23,253

32
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:30,171
Yeah, I've got time.

33
00:02:54,655 --> 00:02:56,646
Mr Incredible.

34
00:03:00,695 --> 00:03:04,324
- What is it, ma'am?
- My cat, Squeaker, won't come down.

35
00:03:06,455 --> 00:03:09,253
Certainly. But stand clear.
There could be trouble.

36
00:03:09,335 --> 00:03:11,212
No, he's quite tame.

37
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,649
Let go now.

38
00:03:40,295 --> 00:03:42,855
Thank you, Mr Incredible.
You've done it again.

39
00:03:42,935 --> 00:03:45,085
- You're the best.
- I'm just here to help.

40
00:03:45,175 --> 00:03:47,530
<i>A</i>tt<i>ention all units.</i>
<i>A tour bus robbe</i>ry...

41
00:03:47,615 --> 00:03:50,049
Tour bus robbery. I've still got time.

42
00:03:50,135 --> 00:03:52,251
Officers. Ma'am. Squeaker.

43
00:03:52,695 --> 00:03:54,970
- Cool. Ready for take-off.
- What the...?

44
00:03:55,055 --> 00:03:57,569
- Who are you supposed to be?
- I'm IncrediBoy.

45
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:59,088
What? No.

46
00:03:59,175 --> 00:04:01,325
You're that kid from the fan club.

47
00:04:01,415 --> 00:04:04,213
Brophy. Brody. Buddy. Buddy.

48
00:04:04,295 --> 00:04:06,047
My name is IncrediBoy.

49
00:04:06,135 --> 00:04:08,126
I've been nice, I've stood for photos,

50
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:12,288
- signed every scrap of paper...
- Don't worry about training me.

51
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:16,209
I know your moves, your style,
favourite catchphrases, everything.

52
00:04:16,295 --> 00:04:17,933
I'm your number one fan.

53
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:22,847
Hey, wait.

54
00:04:31,455 --> 00:04:35,846
You know, you can tell a lot about
a woman by the contents of her purse,

55
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:39,325
but maybe that's not
what you had in mind.

56
00:04:39,415 --> 00:04:40,643
Hey, look...

57
00:04:45,975 --> 00:04:47,169
Elastigirl.

58
00:04:47,255 --> 00:04:49,246
Mr Incredible.

59
00:04:49,975 --> 00:04:51,647
It's all right. I've got him.

60
00:04:51,735 --> 00:04:53,771
Sure. I just took him out for you.

61
00:04:53,855 --> 00:04:57,291
- Sure. His attention was on me.
- A fact I exploited to do my job.

62
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,208
- My job.
- A simple thank you will suffice.

63
00:05:00,295 --> 00:05:02,286
Thanks, but I don't need any help.

64
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:06,607
- Whatever happened to "ladies first"?
- Whatever happened to equal treatment?

65
00:05:06,695 --> 00:05:08,686
The lady got me first.

66
00:05:09,135 --> 00:05:12,207
- Well, we could share, you know.
- I work alone.

67
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:14,684
Well, I think you need to be more

68
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:16,684
flexible.

69
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:19,005
Are you doing anything later?

70
00:05:19,095 --> 00:05:21,370
I have a previous engagement.

71
00:05:32,215 --> 00:05:34,285
Now, you just stay here.

72
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,128
They usually pick up
the garbage in an hour.

73
00:05:37,215 --> 00:05:39,775
- Hey, Incredible.
- Hey, Frozone.

74
00:05:39,855 --> 00:05:43,131
- Shouldn't you be getting ready?
- I still got time.

75
00:05:44,815 --> 00:05:46,533
He's gonna jump!

76
00:06:00,095 --> 00:06:02,086
I think you broke something.

77
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:04,928
With counselling,
I think you'll come to forgive me.

78
00:06:05,015 --> 00:06:07,006
Wait a minute.

79
00:06:36,135 --> 00:06:37,534
Bomb Voyage.

80
00:06:37,935 --> 00:06:39,334
Mr Incredible...!

81
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:40,530
And IncrediBoy.

82
00:06:41,815 --> 00:06:43,294
IncrediBoy?

83
00:06:44,335 --> 00:06:48,089
Aren't you curious about how I get
around so fast? I have rocket boots.

84
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:49,733
- Go home, Buddy. Now.
- What?

85
00:06:49,815 --> 00:06:50,804
Little oaf...!

86
00:06:50,895 --> 00:06:54,126
Can we talk?
You always say be true to yourself,

87
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:56,934
but you never say
which part to be true to.

88
00:06:57,015 --> 00:07:01,611
Well, I've finally figured out who I am.
I am your ward, IncrediBoy.

89
00:07:01,695 --> 00:07:04,414
And now, you have officially
carried it too far.

90
00:07:04,495 --> 00:07:06,929
This is because I don't have powers,
isn't it?

91
00:07:07,015 --> 00:07:10,803
Not every superhero has powers,
you know. You can be super without them.

92
00:07:10,895 --> 00:07:14,251
I invented these.
I can fly. Can you fly?

93
00:07:14,335 --> 00:07:16,371
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

94
00:07:16,455 --> 00:07:18,252
And your outfit is totally ridiculous!

95
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:21,492
Just give me one chance.
I'll show you. I'll get the police.

96
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:23,964
- Buddy, don't.
- It'll only take a second.

97
00:07:24,055 --> 00:07:25,807
No, stop. There's a bomb.

98
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:29,890
Let go, you're wrecking
my flight pattern.

99
00:07:29,975 --> 00:07:32,728
- I can do this if you let go.
- Will you just...?

100
00:07:32,855 --> 00:07:35,892
- I'm trying to help. Stop.
- Let go of my cape.

101
00:08:17,975 --> 00:08:21,809
Take this one home. And make sure
his mom knows what he's been doing.

102
00:08:21,895 --> 00:08:23,692
I can help you. You're making a...

103
00:08:23,775 --> 00:08:26,767
- The jumper. You sent paramedics?
- They picked him up.

104
00:08:26,855 --> 00:08:30,814
That blast was caused by Bomb Voyage,
who I caught robbing the vault.

105
00:08:30,895 --> 00:08:33,250
We might nab him
if we set up a perimeter.

106
00:08:33,335 --> 00:08:35,212
- He got away?
- Well, yeah.

107
00:08:35,295 --> 00:08:37,729
- Skippy here made sure of that.
- IncrediBoy.

108
00:08:37,815 --> 00:08:40,887
You're not affiliated with me.
Holy smokes, I'm late.

109
00:08:40,975 --> 00:08:44,934
- Listen, I've gotta be somewhere.
- What about Bomb Voyage?

110
00:08:45,015 --> 00:08:47,813
Any other night, I'd go after him,
but I gotta go.

111
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:51,205
Don't worry.
We'll get him. Eventually.

112
00:08:56,615 --> 00:08:59,288
- Is the night still young?
- You're very late.

113
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:02,606
- How do I look? Good?
- The mask. You still got the mask.

114
00:09:05,055 --> 00:09:06,852
Showtime.

115
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:13,804
Robert Parr, will you have this woman
to be your lawful wedded wife?

116
00:09:13,895 --> 00:09:16,967
You're late. When you asked
if I was doing anything later,

117
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:20,172
I didn't realize you'd forgotten.
I thought it was banter.

118
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:22,610
- It was.
- Cutting it close, don't you think?

119
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,084
You need to be more flexible.

120
00:09:25,175 --> 00:09:27,564
I love you, but if we're
gonna make this work,

121
00:09:27,655 --> 00:09:29,646
you must be more than Mr Incredible.

122
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,691
You know that. Don't you?

123
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:34,130
...so long as you both shall live?
- I do.

124
00:09:34,215 --> 00:09:37,127
I pronounce this couple
husband and wife.

125
00:09:39,655 --> 00:09:43,045
As long as we both shall live.
No matter what happens.

126
00:09:43,135 --> 00:09:47,128
Hey, come on. We're superheroes.
What could happen?

127
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:52,971
<i>In a stunning turn of events,</i>

<i>the famed superhero in Superior Court.</i>

131
00:10:05,414 --> 00:10:08,611
Mr Sansweet didn't ask to be saved.
He didn't want to be saved.

132
00:10:08,694 --> 00:10:11,527
The injury received from
Mr Incredible's "actions",

133
00:10:11,614 --> 00:10:13,844
- causes him daily pain.
- I saved your life.

134
00:10:13,934 --> 00:10:16,323
You didn't save my life.
You ruined my death.

135
00:10:16,414 --> 00:10:17,847
No further comment.

136
00:10:17,934 --> 00:10:22,052
<i>Shortly, another suit was filed</i>

It is time for their secret identity
to become their only identity.

140
00:10:34,574 --> 00:10:37,407

Denied? You're denying my claim?

150
00:11:09,973 --> 00:11:12,441
I don't understand,
I have full coverage.

151
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:16,452
I'm sorry, but our liability
is spelled out in paragraph <i>1</i> 7.

152
00:11:16,452 --> 00:11:17,009
I'm sorry, but our liability
is spelled out in paragraph <i>1</i> 7.

153
00:11:17,092 --> 00:11:19,560
- It states clearly...
- I can't pay for this.

154
00:11:19,652 --> 00:11:21,882
Excuse me. Claims, Bob Parr.

155
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,532
I'm calling to celebrate
a momentous occasion.

156
00:11:24,612 --> 00:11:26,728
We're now officially moved in.

157
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:30,361
That's great, honey. The last
three years don't count because...?

158
00:11:30,452 --> 00:11:34,764
Because I finally unpacked the last box.
Now, it's official.

159
00:11:34,852 --> 00:11:37,730
- <i>Why do we have so much junk?</i>
- Listen, I've got a client.

160
00:11:37,812 --> 00:11:40,724
Say no more. Go save the world
one policy at a time.

161
00:11:40,812 --> 00:11:43,121
I gotta go pick up the kids.
See you tonight.

162
00:11:43,212 --> 00:11:45,726
Bye, honey.
Excuse me. Where were we?

163
00:11:45,812 --> 00:11:50,090
I'm on a fixed income,
and if you can't help me,

164
00:11:50,172 --> 00:11:52,402
I don't know what I'll do.

165
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:03,004
Listen closely.
I'd like to help you, but I can't.

166
00:12:03,092 --> 00:12:06,607
I'd like to say take a copy of
your policy to Norma Wilcox on...

167
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:11,720
Norma Wilcox. W-I-L-C-O-X.
On the third floor. But I can't.

168
00:12:11,812 --> 00:12:15,122
I also do not advise you
to fill out and file a WS2475 form

169
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:17,680
with our legal department
on the second floor.

170
00:12:17,772 --> 00:12:20,844
I wouldn't expect someone
to resolve the matter quickly.

171
00:12:20,932 --> 00:12:23,400
I'd like to help,
but there's nothing I can do.

172
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:27,246
- Thank you, young man.
- I'm sorry, ma'am. I know you're upset.

173
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:29,323
Pretend to be upset.

174
00:12:32,612 --> 00:12:36,810
Parr. You authorized payment
on the Walker policy.

175
00:12:36,892 --> 00:12:39,042
Someone broke into their house, Mr Huph.

176
00:12:39,132 --> 00:12:41,692
- Their policy covers...
- I don't wanna know.

177
00:12:41,772 --> 00:12:45,685
Don't tell me about coverage. Tell me
how you keep Insuricare in the black.

178
00:12:45,772 --> 00:12:49,765
How's that possible, with you writing
cheques to every Harry Hardluck

179
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,127
that gives you a phone call.

180
00:12:54,252 --> 00:12:57,130
<i>Morning break is over.</i>

181
00:13:01,092 --> 00:13:03,447
I appreciate you coming
down here, Mrs Parr.

182
00:13:04,132 --> 00:13:07,647
What's this about?
Has Dash done something wrong?

183
00:13:07,732 --> 00:13:11,725
He's a disruptive influence and he
openly mocks me in front of the class.

184
00:13:11,812 --> 00:13:14,121
- He says.
- Look, I know it's you.

185
00:13:14,212 --> 00:13:17,124
- He puts thumbtacks on my stool.
- You saw him do this?

186
00:13:17,212 --> 00:13:21,046
Well... not really. No.
Actually, not.

187
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:23,088
Then how do you know it was him?

188
00:13:23,172 --> 00:13:25,606
I hid a camera.
And this time, I've got him.

189
00:13:31,772 --> 00:13:34,332
See? You see?

190
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:35,925
You don't see it?

191
00:13:37,852 --> 00:13:40,082
He moves. Right there.

192
00:13:40,172 --> 00:13:45,292
Wait, wait. Right there.
Right as I'm sitting down.

193
00:13:45,372 --> 00:13:49,331
I don't know how he does it,
but there's no tack before he moves

194
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:53,371
and after he moves, there's a tack.
Coincidence? I think not.

195
00:13:56,212 --> 00:13:58,806
- Bernie...
- Don't "Bernie" me.

196
00:13:58,892 --> 00:14:00,883
This little rat is guilty.

197
00:14:00,972 --> 00:14:05,204
You and your son can go now, Mrs Parr.
I'm sorry for the trouble.

198
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:08,125
You're letting him go again?
He's guilty.

199
00:14:08,212 --> 00:14:11,682
You can see it on his smug little face.
Guilty, I say, guilty.

200
00:14:15,212 --> 00:14:19,842
Dash, this is the third time this year
you've been sent to the office.

201
00:14:19,932 --> 00:14:24,289
We need to find a better outlet.
A more constructive outlet.

202
00:14:24,372 --> 00:14:27,125
Maybe I could,
if you'd let me go out for sports.

203
00:14:27,212 --> 00:14:29,282
Honey, you know why we can't do that.

204
00:14:29,372 --> 00:14:33,809
I promise I'll slow up.
I'll only be the best by a tiny bit.

205
00:14:33,892 --> 00:14:37,771
Dashiell Robert Parr,
you are an incredibly competitive boy.

206
00:14:37,852 --> 00:14:41,288
And a bit of a show-off.
The last thing you need is temptation.

207
00:14:41,372 --> 00:14:44,603
You always say, "Do your best."
But you don't really mean it.

208
00:14:44,692 --> 00:14:46,842
Why can't I do the best that I can do?

209
00:14:46,932 --> 00:14:51,767
Right now, the world wants us to fit in,
so we gotta be like everybody else.

210
00:14:51,852 --> 00:14:54,446
Dad said our powers
were nothing to be ashamed of.

211
00:14:54,532 --> 00:14:58,286
- Our powers made us special.
- Everyone's special, Dash.

212
00:14:58,372 --> 00:15:00,932
Which is another way
of saying no one is.

213
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:12,403
Hey, Rydinger, where you headed?

214
00:15:14,732 --> 00:15:16,848
- Hi, Tony.
- Hey.

215
00:15:16,932 --> 00:15:20,129
- Hey, Tony, can I carry your books?
- That's kind of funny.

216
00:15:20,652 --> 00:15:23,212
Hey, Tony, do you play football?

217
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:28,007
Tony, I thought we were
gonna go swimming.

218
00:15:29,692 --> 00:15:31,569
He looked at me.

219
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:34,327
Come on, Violet.

220
00:15:57,732 --> 00:16:00,530
Darn kids. Sitting on the driveway...

221
00:16:01,812 --> 00:16:03,803
Oh, great.

222
00:16:38,532 --> 00:16:40,284
Mom.

223
00:16:41,372 --> 00:16:44,842
- You're making weird faces again.
- No, I'm not.

224
00:16:44,932 --> 00:16:47,241
You make weird faces, honey.

225
00:16:47,332 --> 00:16:50,722
- Do you have to read at the table?
- Yeah.

226
00:16:51,372 --> 00:16:53,567
Smaller bites, Dash.

227
00:16:53,652 --> 00:16:56,405
Bob, could you help
the carnivore cut his meat?

228
00:16:57,332 --> 00:17:01,769
Dash, you have something you
wanna tell your father about school?

229
00:17:01,852 --> 00:17:05,481
- Well, we dissected a frog.
- Dash got sent to the office again.

230
00:17:05,572 --> 00:17:08,006
- Good.
- No, Bob, that's bad.

231
00:17:08,092 --> 00:17:11,129
- What?
- Dash got sent to the office again.

232
00:17:11,212 --> 00:17:12,964
- What? What for?
- Nothing.

233
00:17:13,052 --> 00:17:15,805
He put a tack on the teacher's chair,
during class.

234
00:17:15,892 --> 00:17:18,486
Nobody saw me.
You could barely see it on the tape.

235
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:21,484
They caught you on tape
and you still got away with it?

236
00:17:21,572 --> 00:17:24,086
You must have been booking.
How fast did you go?

237
00:17:24,172 --> 00:17:27,767
- We are not encouraging this.
- I'm not, I'm just asking how fast...

238
00:17:27,852 --> 00:17:29,205
Honey.

239
00:17:31,652 --> 00:17:34,485
First the car,
now I gotta pay to fix the table...

240
00:17:34,572 --> 00:17:36,802
What happened to the car?

241
00:17:37,372 --> 00:17:40,045
Here. I'm getting a new plate.

242
00:17:41,252 --> 00:17:43,243
How about you, Vi?
How was school?

243
00:17:43,332 --> 00:17:45,971
- Nothing to report.
- You've hardly eaten.

244
00:17:46,052 --> 00:17:49,567
- I'm not hungry for meatloaf.
- Well, it is leftover night.

245
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,485
We have steak, pasta...
What are you hungry for?

246
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,166
- Tony Rydinger.
- Shut up.

247
00:17:55,252 --> 00:17:58,085
- Well, you are.
- I said, shut up, you little insect.

248
00:17:58,172 --> 00:18:00,606
- Well, she is.
- Do not shout at the table.

249
00:18:00,692 --> 00:18:03,968
- Honey.
- Kids. Listen to your mother.

250
00:18:04,692 --> 00:18:07,525
She'd eat if we were having Tonyloaf.

251
00:18:07,612 --> 00:18:09,125
That's it.

252
00:18:09,212 --> 00:18:10,327
Stop it.

253
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:14,727
- You're gonna be toast.
- Stop running in the house.

254
00:18:15,332 --> 00:18:16,526
Sit down.

255
00:18:17,452 --> 00:18:20,012
- Hey, no force fields.
- You started it.

256
00:18:20,092 --> 00:18:22,560
You sit down. You sit down.

257
00:18:22,652 --> 00:18:23,971
Violet.

258
00:18:30,732 --> 00:18:31,851
"Simon J Paladino...

259
00:18:31,851 --> 00:18:32,283
"Simon J Paladino...

260
00:18:33,451 --> 00:18:36,488
...Iongtime advocate
of superhero rights, is missing."

261
00:18:36,891 --> 00:18:38,796
- Gazerbeam.
- Bob. It's time to engage.

262
00:18:38,796 --> 00:18:41,105
- Gazerbeam.
- Bob. It's time to engage.

263
00:18:41,196 --> 00:18:43,471
Do something.
Don't just stand there.

264
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:45,990
- I need you to intervene.
- Intervene?

265
00:18:46,076 --> 00:18:48,192
OK. I'm intervening.

266
00:18:49,676 --> 00:18:51,792
Violet, let go of your brother.

267
00:18:51,876 --> 00:18:53,355
Hello?

268
00:18:54,236 --> 00:18:55,908
Get the door.

269
00:18:56,396 --> 00:18:59,832
- Hey, Lucius.
- Hey, Speedo. Helen, Vi, Jack-Jack.

270
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:03,431
- Ice of you to drop by.
- Never heard that one before.

271
00:19:03,516 --> 00:19:05,154
Lucius.

272
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,430
- I like it when it shatters.
- I'll be back later.

273
00:19:13,516 --> 00:19:15,950
- Where are you two going?
- It's Wednesday.

274
00:19:16,036 --> 00:19:19,108
Bowling night.
Say hello to Honey for me, Lucius.

275
00:19:19,196 --> 00:19:21,756
Will do. Good night, Helen.
Good night, kids.

276
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:28,545
Don't think you've avoided
talking about the principal's office.

277
00:19:28,636 --> 00:19:30,706
Your father and I
are gonna discuss it.

278
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:33,629
I'm not the only kid
who's been sent to the office.

279
00:19:33,716 --> 00:19:35,707
Other kids don't have superpowers.

280
00:19:35,796 --> 00:19:39,027
- It's perfectly normal...
- What do you know about normal?

281
00:19:39,116 --> 00:19:41,676
What does this family
know about normal?

282
00:19:41,756 --> 00:19:45,544
- Now, wait a minute, young lady.
- We act normal. I wanna be normal.

283
00:19:45,636 --> 00:19:49,515
The only normal one is Jack-Jack,
and he's not even toilet trained.

284
00:19:50,796 --> 00:19:52,468
Lucky.

285
00:19:52,556 --> 00:19:54,945
I meant about being normal.

286
00:19:57,236 --> 00:19:59,147
So now I'm in deep trouble.

287
00:19:59,236 --> 00:20:02,194
I mean, one more jolt of this
death ray and I'm an epitaph.

288
00:20:02,276 --> 00:20:05,393
Somehow I found cover.
What does Baron Von Ruthless do?

289
00:20:05,476 --> 00:20:08,149
He starts monologuing.

290
00:20:08,236 --> 00:20:12,115
He starts this prepared speech
about how feeble I am compared to him.

291
00:20:12,196 --> 00:20:15,905
How inevitable my defeat is,
the world will soon be his.

292
00:20:16,396 --> 00:20:17,749
Yammering.

293
00:20:17,836 --> 00:20:20,873
The guy has me on a platter,
and he won't shut up.

294
00:20:20,956 --> 00:20:24,392
- <i>... three Municiberg, we have a 23</i>- <i>56...</i>
- 23-56, what is that?

295
00:20:24,476 --> 00:20:26,626
- Robbery?
- This is just sad.

296
00:20:26,716 --> 00:20:28,547
- Want to catch a robber?
- No.

297
00:20:28,636 --> 00:20:31,025
Tell you the truth,
I'd rather go bowling.

298
00:20:31,116 --> 00:20:35,394
Look, what if we actually did
what our wives think we're doing?

299
00:20:35,476 --> 00:20:36,989
Just to shake things up.

300
00:20:37,076 --> 00:20:41,547
He's not alone.
The fat guy's still with him.

301
00:20:41,636 --> 00:20:43,866
They're just talking.

302
00:20:43,956 --> 00:20:46,675
- What are we doing here?
- Protecting people.

303
00:20:46,756 --> 00:20:49,224
- Nobody asked us.
- You need an invitation?

304
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:52,752
I'd like one, yes. We keep
sneaking out to do this, and...

305
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:56,146
- You remember Gazerbeam?
- There was something in the paper.

306
00:20:56,236 --> 00:20:59,308
- He had trouble with civilian life.
- When did you see him?

307
00:20:59,396 --> 00:21:02,627
I don't see anyone from the old days.
Just you.

308
00:21:02,716 --> 00:21:04,991
- We're pushing our luck as it is.
- Come on.

309
00:21:05,076 --> 00:21:07,749
It was fun the first time,
but if we keep...

310
00:21:07,836 --> 00:21:11,067
- <i>We have a report on a fire...</i>
- A fire. We're close.

311
00:21:11,156 --> 00:21:13,954
- Yeah, baby.
- We're gonna get caught.

312
00:21:16,516 --> 00:21:18,871
Fire. Yeah.

313
00:21:26,636 --> 00:21:28,752
- Is that everybody?
- Yeah.

314
00:21:30,196 --> 00:21:33,347
- It better be.
- Can't you put this out?

315
00:21:33,476 --> 00:21:36,468
I can't lay a layer thick enough.
It evaporates too fast.

316
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:38,672
- What's that mean?
- It means it's hot.

317
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,986
- I'm dehydrated, Bob.
- You're out of ice?

318
00:21:41,076 --> 00:21:43,351
You can't run out.
Use water in the air.

319
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:47,065
There is no water in this air.
What's your excuse, run out of muscle?

320
00:21:47,156 --> 00:21:49,954
I can't smash walls.
The building's getting weaker.

321
00:21:50,036 --> 00:21:53,073
- It's gonna come down on top of us.
- I wanted to go bowling.

322
00:21:55,716 --> 00:21:59,186
All right. Stay right on my tail.
This is gonna get hot.

323
00:22:17,516 --> 00:22:19,108
Oh, good.

324
00:22:21,156 --> 00:22:22,635
That ain't right.

325
00:22:24,836 --> 00:22:28,272
- We look like incompetent bad guys.
- You get water out of the air.

326
00:22:28,356 --> 00:22:30,074
Freeze.

327
00:22:34,356 --> 00:22:35,391
Freeze.

328
00:22:35,476 --> 00:22:38,149
- I'm thirsty.
- I said freeze.

329
00:22:38,236 --> 00:22:40,989
I'm just getting a drink.

330
00:22:44,756 --> 00:22:49,625
- You've had your drink. Now...
- I know. Freeze.

331
00:22:52,516 --> 00:22:54,029
Police officers.

332
00:23:05,276 --> 00:23:07,232
That was way too close.

333
00:23:07,316 --> 00:23:09,955
We are not doing that again.

334
00:23:12,396 --> 00:23:15,468
<i>Verify you want to switch targets? Over.</i>

335
00:23:15,556 --> 00:23:18,946
Trust me. This is the one
he's been looking for.

336
00:23:43,796 --> 00:23:46,993
- I thought you'd be back by <i>1 1</i>.
- I said I'd be back later.

337
00:23:47,076 --> 00:23:50,751
I assumed if you came back at all
you'd be "back later".

338
00:23:50,836 --> 00:23:53,509
Well, I'm back, OK?

339
00:23:59,876 --> 00:24:01,912
Is this rubble?

340
00:24:01,996 --> 00:24:05,306
It was just a little workout.
Just to stay loose.

341
00:24:05,396 --> 00:24:08,832
You know how I feel about that.
We can't blow cover again.

342
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:11,828
- The building was coming down anyway.
- What?

343
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:13,508
You knocked down a building?

344
00:24:13,596 --> 00:24:16,349
It was on fire. Structurally unsound.

345
00:24:16,436 --> 00:24:18,825
Were you listening
to the police scanner?

346
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,794
I performed a public service.
You act like that's bad.

347
00:24:21,876 --> 00:24:23,355
It is a bad thing.

348
00:24:23,436 --> 00:24:27,395
Uprooting our family again, so you can
relive the glory days is a bad thing.

349
00:24:27,476 --> 00:24:30,274
It's better than acting like
they didn't happen.

350
00:24:30,356 --> 00:24:32,631
Yes. They happened.
But this, our family,

351
00:24:32,716 --> 00:24:35,947
is what's happening now, Bob.
You are missing this.

352
00:24:36,036 --> 00:24:39,267
I can't believe you don't want to go
to your son's graduation.

353
00:24:39,356 --> 00:24:42,666
It's not a graduation.
He's moving from fourth to fifth grade.

354
00:24:42,756 --> 00:24:44,667
- It's a ceremony.
- It's psychotic.

355
00:24:44,756 --> 00:24:49,272
They create ways to celebrate mediocrity
but if someone is exceptional...

356
00:24:49,356 --> 00:24:51,506
This is not about you.
It's about Dash.

357
00:24:51,596 --> 00:24:54,315
You want to do something for Dash?
Let him compete.

358
00:24:54,396 --> 00:24:57,035
- Let him go out for sports.
- I will not be the enemy.

359
00:24:57,116 --> 00:24:59,869
- You know why we can't.
- Because he'd be great.

360
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,912
This is not about you.

361
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:06,794
All right, Dash.
I know you're listening. Come on out.

362
00:25:06,876 --> 00:25:09,026
Vi? You, too, young lady.

363
00:25:09,116 --> 00:25:11,425
Come on. Come on out.

364
00:25:12,436 --> 00:25:14,996
It's OK, kids.
We're just having a discussion.

365
00:25:15,076 --> 00:25:16,748
Pretty loud discussion.

366
00:25:16,836 --> 00:25:20,306
But that's OK. What's important
is that Mommy and I are a team.

367
00:25:20,396 --> 00:25:25,993
- We're united against the forces of...
- Pig-headedness?

368
00:25:26,076 --> 00:25:28,510
- I was gonna say evil.
- We're sorry we woke you.

369
00:25:28,596 --> 00:25:30,826
Everything's OK.
Go back to bed. It's late.

370
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:32,952
- Night, Mom. Night, Dad.
- Good night.

371
00:25:33,036 --> 00:25:36,346
In fact, we should all be in bed.

372
00:25:48,796 --> 00:25:53,312
<i>Request claim</i>
<i>on claim numbers 1 58, 183...</i>

373
00:25:53,396 --> 00:25:55,910
<i>Haven't you got him yet?</i>
<i>Where is he?</i>

374
00:25:55,996 --> 00:25:58,510
<i>Mr Huph would like to</i>
<i>talk to you in his office.</i>

375
00:25:58,596 --> 00:26:00,587
- Now?
- <i>Now.</i>

376
00:26:18,316 --> 00:26:20,307
Sit down, Bob.

377
00:26:24,556 --> 00:26:28,868
I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.

378
00:26:29,556 --> 00:26:32,229
- Ask me why.
- OK. Why?

379
00:26:32,316 --> 00:26:34,147
Why what? Be specific, Bob.

380
00:26:34,236 --> 00:26:37,672
- Why are you unhappy?
- Your customers make me unhappy.

381
00:26:37,756 --> 00:26:40,873
- You've gotten complaints?
- Complaints I can handle.

382
00:26:40,956 --> 00:26:44,426
What I can't handle is your customers'
inexplicable knowledge

383
00:26:44,516 --> 00:26:48,304
of Insuricare's inner workings.
They're experts. Experts, Bob.

384
00:26:48,396 --> 00:26:51,388
Exploiting every loophole,
dodging every obstacle.

385
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:53,785
They're penetrating the bureaucracy.

386
00:26:53,876 --> 00:26:56,515
- Did I do something illegal?
- No.

387
00:26:56,596 --> 00:27:00,748
- We shouldn't help our customers?
- The law requires that I answer no.

388
00:27:00,836 --> 00:27:03,908
- We're supposed to help people.
- Help our people.

389
00:27:03,996 --> 00:27:08,148
Starting with our stockholders.
Who's helping them out, huh?

390
00:27:10,156 --> 00:27:14,149
You know, Bob, a company...

391
00:27:14,236 --> 00:27:15,794
Is like an enormous clock.

392
00:27:15,876 --> 00:27:19,710
...is like an enormous...
Yes. Precisely.

393
00:27:19,796 --> 00:27:24,267
It only works if all
the little cogs mesh together.

394
00:27:24,356 --> 00:27:29,476
Now, a clock needs to be cleaned,
well-lubricated and wound tight.

395
00:27:29,556 --> 00:27:35,028
The best clocks have jewel movements,
cogs that fit, that cooperate by design.

396
00:27:35,116 --> 00:27:39,314
I'm being metaphorical, Bob.
Know what I mean by cooperative cogs?

397
00:27:39,396 --> 00:27:40,988
Bob?

398
00:27:41,116 --> 00:27:43,835
Bob? Look at me
when I'm talking to you, Parr.

399
00:27:43,916 --> 00:27:47,033
- That man out there needs help.
- Don't change the subject.

400
00:27:47,116 --> 00:27:50,153
- We're discussing your attitude.
- He's getting mugged.

401
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:52,670
- Let's hope we don't cover him.
- I'll be back.

402
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:56,146
Stop right now or you're fired.

403
00:27:58,556 --> 00:28:00,626
Close the door.

404
00:28:02,356 --> 00:28:04,551
Get over here, now.

405
00:28:08,116 --> 00:28:11,586
I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.

406
00:28:12,596 --> 00:28:16,225
- He got away.
- Good thing, too.

407
00:28:16,316 --> 00:28:18,876
You were this close to losing your...

408
00:28:30,316 --> 00:28:33,786
<i>Please report to</i>
<i>operating room 7 22 immediately.</i>

409
00:28:40,156 --> 00:28:41,794

- He'll live.

410
00:28:41,876 --> 00:28:43,434
- I'm fired.
- You think?

411
00:28:43,516 --> 00:28:46,155
- What can I say?
- Nothing you haven't said before.

412
00:28:46,236 --> 00:28:48,192
- Someone was in trouble.
- As always.

413
00:28:48,276 --> 00:28:49,675
I had to do something.

414
00:28:49,756 --> 00:28:52,873
When you say that, it's
a month and a half of trouble for me.

415
00:28:52,956 --> 00:28:55,186
Thousands of taxpayers' dollars.

416
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:57,744
- I know.
- We pay to keep the company quiet.

417
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:00,828
We pay damages, erase memories,
relocate your family.

418
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:03,476
Every time it gets harder.
Money, money, money.

419
00:29:03,556 --> 00:29:07,310
We can't keep doing this. We appreciate
what you did in the old days,

420
00:29:07,396 --> 00:29:10,593
but those days are over.
From now on, you're on your own.

421
00:29:13,636 --> 00:29:17,993
Listen, Bob. Maybe I could relocate you,
you know, for old times' sake.

422
00:29:18,076 --> 00:29:21,034
I can't do that to my family.
Everyone just got settled.

423
00:29:21,116 --> 00:29:23,266
I'll make it work. Thanks.

424
00:29:23,356 --> 00:29:25,347
Take care of yourself.

425
00:29:36,956 --> 00:29:39,072
What are you waiting for?

426
00:29:39,156 --> 00:29:43,035
I don't know.
Something amazing, I guess.

427
00:29:43,796 --> 00:29:45,866
Me, too, kid.

428
00:30:21,436 --> 00:30:22,755

<i>Voice</i>- <i>matching will ensure security.</i>

450
00:31:31,516 --> 00:31:35,191
<i>The supers aren't gone, Mr Incredible.</i>
<i>You're still here.</i>

451
00:31:35,276 --> 00:31:37,506
<i>You can still do great things.</i>

452
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:42,226
<i>Or you can listen to police scanners.</i>
<i>Your choice.</i>

453
00:31:42,316 --> 00:31:45,706
<i>You have 2 4 hours to respond.</i>
<i>Think about it.</i>

454
00:32:22,396 --> 00:32:25,035
<i>This message will self</i>- <i>destruct.</i>

455
00:32:42,236 --> 00:32:44,796
You are one distracted guy.

456
00:32:44,876 --> 00:32:46,832
Am I? I don't mean to be.

457
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:52,388
I know you miss being a hero
and your job is frustrating.

458
00:32:52,476 --> 00:32:56,947
I want you to know how much it means
to me that you stay at it anyway.

459
00:32:57,036 --> 00:32:59,550
- Honey? About the job?
- What?

460
00:32:59,636 --> 00:33:01,786
- Something's happened.
- What?

461
00:33:01,876 --> 00:33:03,434
- The...
- What?

462
00:33:03,516 --> 00:33:06,906
The company is sending me
to a conference.

463
00:33:06,996 --> 00:33:09,635
Out of town.
I'm gonna be gone for a few days.

464
00:33:09,716 --> 00:33:14,073
They've never sent you to a conference
before. This is good, isn't it?

465
00:33:14,156 --> 00:33:15,145
Yes.

466
00:33:15,236 --> 00:33:18,387
You see. They're finally
recognizing your talents.

467
00:33:18,476 --> 00:33:19,829
- You're moving up.
- Yes.

468
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:22,908
- Honey. This is wonderful.
- Yes, it is.

469
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:26,110
<i>Hello?</i>

470
00:33:26,196 --> 00:33:28,107
This is Mr Incredible.

471
00:33:28,836 --> 00:33:30,030
I'm in.

472
00:33:35,636 --> 00:33:39,754
The Omnidroid 9000
is a top secret prototype battle robot.

473
00:33:39,836 --> 00:33:43,226
Its artificial intelligence
enables it to solve any problem

474
00:33:43,316 --> 00:33:46,069
it's confronted with. Unfortunately...

475
00:33:46,156 --> 00:33:49,626
Let me guess. It got smart enough
to wonder why it took orders.

476
00:33:49,716 --> 00:33:53,755
We lost control. It's loose in
the jungle, threatening our facility.

477
00:33:53,836 --> 00:33:56,350
We've evacuated all personnel
from the island.

478
00:33:56,436 --> 00:33:57,664
How am I going in?

479
00:33:57,756 --> 00:34:01,510
The Omnidroid's defences necessitate
an air drop from 5000 feet.

480
00:34:01,596 --> 00:34:04,952
Its cloaking devices
make it difficult to track.

481
00:34:05,036 --> 00:34:08,187
We're pretty sure it's on
the southern half of the island.

482
00:34:08,276 --> 00:34:11,871
One more thing. Obviously it
represents a significant investment.

483
00:34:11,956 --> 00:34:14,151
Shut it down without destroying it.

484
00:34:14,236 --> 00:34:16,704
You are Mr Incredible.

485
00:34:34,836 --> 00:34:37,430
I've got to warn you,
it's a learning robot.

486
00:34:37,516 --> 00:34:41,145
Every moment you fight it increases
its knowledge of how to beat you.

487
00:34:41,236 --> 00:34:43,352
Shut it down quickly.
Don't destroy it.

488
00:34:43,436 --> 00:34:46,826
- And don't die.
- Great. Thanks.

489
00:35:15,476 --> 00:35:17,114
Showtime.

490
00:37:19,516 --> 00:37:21,029
My back.

491
00:38:26,156 --> 00:38:29,671
Surprising. We must bring him back.

492
00:38:29,756 --> 00:38:33,465
Sound the all clear,
and invite him to dinner.

493
00:38:52,036 --> 00:38:54,152
Most important, keep things light.

494
00:38:54,236 --> 00:38:57,990
Praise him. Make him feel
like we appreciate his abilities.

495
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:03,114
- Am I overdressed?
- Actually, you look rather dashing.

496
00:39:03,476 --> 00:39:06,115
- I take it our host is...
- I'm sorry.

497
00:39:06,196 --> 00:39:09,347
He won't be dining with us.
He hopes you'll understand.

498
00:39:09,436 --> 00:39:12,826
Of course. I do usually make it a point
to know who I'm working for.

499
00:39:12,916 --> 00:39:15,714
He prefers a certain amount
of anonymity.

500
00:39:15,796 --> 00:39:18,264
Surely, you of all people
understand that.

501
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:22,827
I was just wondering, of all the places
to settle down, why live...

502
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:26,989
With a volcano? He's attracted to power.
So am I.

503
00:39:27,076 --> 00:39:30,705
- It's a weakness we share.
- Seems a bit unstable.

504
00:39:30,796 --> 00:39:33,868
I prefer to think of it
as misunderstood.

505
00:39:33,956 --> 00:39:35,435
Aren't we all?

506
00:39:35,516 --> 00:39:38,110
Volcanic soil is among
the most fertile on Earth.

507
00:39:38,196 --> 00:39:41,233
Everything at the table
was grown right here.

508
00:39:41,316 --> 00:39:45,389
- How does it compare?
- Everything's delicious.

509
00:41:04,876 --> 00:41:07,071
- Jeez.
- Hurry, honey.

510
00:41:07,156 --> 00:41:09,112
Or you'll be late for work.

511
00:41:10,636 --> 00:41:12,592
- Have a great day, honey.
- Thanks.

512
00:41:12,676 --> 00:41:15,429
- Help customers, climb ladders...
- Bring bacon.

513
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:17,472
All that jazz.

514
00:41:24,796 --> 00:41:28,311
- <i>You have an appointment?</i>
- I'm an old friend. I just wanted to...

515
00:41:28,396 --> 00:41:31,706
- <i>All visitors are required...</i>
- <i>Go check the electric fence.</i>

516
00:41:31,796 --> 00:41:33,787
<i>What is it?</i>
<i>What do you want?</i>

517
00:41:35,116 --> 00:41:38,870
<i>My God, you've go</i>tt<i>en fat. Come in.</i>
<i>Come, come.</i>

518
00:41:45,756 --> 00:41:50,307
Yes, things are going quite well.
Quite well. My God, no complaints.

519
00:41:50,396 --> 00:41:54,594
But, you know, it is not the same.
Not the same at all.

520
00:41:54,676 --> 00:41:57,349
Weren't you in the news?
Some show in Prague?

521
00:41:57,436 --> 00:41:59,427
Milan, darling. Milan.

522
00:41:59,516 --> 00:42:03,270
Supermodels. Nothing super about them.

523
00:42:03,356 --> 00:42:05,506
Spoiled, stupid, little stick figures

524
00:42:05,596 --> 00:42:08,235
with poofy lips
who think only about themselves.

525
00:42:08,796 --> 00:42:11,993
I used to design for gods.

526
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:17,716
But perhaps you come with a challenge?
I was surprised to get your call.

527
00:42:17,796 --> 00:42:20,515
E, I just need a patch job.

528
00:42:20,596 --> 00:42:23,713
This is megamesh.
Outmoded, but very sturdy.

529
00:42:23,796 --> 00:42:27,914
And you've torn right through it.
What have you been doing, Robert?

530
00:42:27,996 --> 00:42:30,191
Moonlighting hero work?

531
00:42:30,276 --> 00:42:32,267
Must have happened a long time ago.

532
00:42:32,356 --> 00:42:35,314
I see. This is a hobo suit, darling.

533
00:42:35,396 --> 00:42:37,990
You can't be seen in this.
I won't allow it.

534
00:42:38,076 --> 00:42:41,955
- Fifteen years ago, maybe, but now?
- What do you mean? You designed it.

535
00:42:42,036 --> 00:42:45,073
I never look back, darling.
It distracts from the now.

536
00:42:45,156 --> 00:42:47,716
You need a new suit.
That much is certain.

537
00:42:47,796 --> 00:42:50,151
Where the heck
am I gonna get a new suit?

538
00:42:50,236 --> 00:42:52,545
You can't. It's impossible.
I'm too busy.

539
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:54,752
So ask me now,
before I again become sane.

540
00:42:54,836 --> 00:42:57,634
Wait. You want to make me a suit?

541
00:42:57,716 --> 00:43:00,913
You push too hard, darling.
But I accept.

542
00:43:01,396 --> 00:43:03,956
- It will be bold. Dramatic.
- Yeah.

543
00:43:04,036 --> 00:43:09,030
- Heroic.
- Yeah, something classic, like Dynaguy.

544
00:43:09,116 --> 00:43:12,313
He had a great look.
The cape and the boots...

545
00:43:12,396 --> 00:43:13,385
No capes.

546
00:43:14,716 --> 00:43:18,311
- Isn't that my decision?
- Do you remember Thunderhead?

547
00:43:18,396 --> 00:43:21,115
Tall, storm powers. Nice man.
Good with kids.

548
00:43:21,196 --> 00:43:23,949
- Listen, E...
- November <i>1</i> 5th of '58.

549
00:43:25,396 --> 00:43:30,424
<i>All was well, another day saved</i>
<i>when his cape snagged on a missile fin.</i>

550
00:43:30,516 --> 00:43:32,791
Thunderhead was not
the brightest bulb...

551
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:33,865
Stratogale.

552
00:43:33,956 --> 00:43:38,984
<i>April 23rd, '57.</i>
<i>Cape caught in a jet turbine.</i>

553
00:43:39,076 --> 00:43:41,226
You can't generalize about these...

554
00:43:41,316 --> 00:43:44,467
<i>Meta</i>- <i>Man. Express elevator.</i>
<i>Dynaguy, snag on takeoff.</i>

555
00:43:44,556 --> 00:43:47,593
Splashdown, sucked into a vortex.
No capes.

556
00:43:47,676 --> 00:43:51,589
Now, go on. Your new suit will be
finished before your next assignment.

557
00:43:51,676 --> 00:43:53,632
You know I'm retired from hero work.

558
00:43:53,716 --> 00:43:57,311
As am I, Robert.
Yet, here we are.

559
00:43:57,396 --> 00:44:01,071
E, I only need a patch job.
For sentimental reasons.

560
00:44:01,876 --> 00:44:05,027
Fine. I will also fix the hobo suit.

561
00:44:05,116 --> 00:44:09,473
- You're the best of the best, E.
- Yes, I know, darling. I know.

562
00:44:21,956 --> 00:44:24,186
Don't answer it, honey, I got it.

563
00:44:24,276 --> 00:44:26,995
- Hello?
- We have a new assignment for you.

564
00:44:30,756 --> 00:44:33,589
- <i>When can you get here?</i>
- <i>I'll leave tomorrow morning.</i>

565
00:44:33,676 --> 00:44:35,348
- <i>See you there.</i>
- Goodbye.

566
00:44:38,076 --> 00:44:40,670
Who was that, honey? The office?

567
00:44:40,756 --> 00:44:45,352
Another conference.
Short notice, but you know, duty calls.

568
00:44:52,876 --> 00:44:54,912
- Bob?
- Yeah, what's up, honey?

569
00:44:57,156 --> 00:44:59,306
- Have a great trip.
- Thanks, sweetie.

570
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:01,705
- I'll call you when I get there.
- I love you.

571
00:45:01,796 --> 00:45:05,948
- So much.
- I love you too.

572
00:45:18,196 --> 00:45:20,471
<i>This is your automated Captain.</i>

573
00:45:20,556 --> 00:45:23,673
<i>Would you care for more mimosa?</i>

574
00:45:23,756 --> 00:45:26,748
- Don't mind if I do. Thanks.
- <i>You're welcome.</i>

575
00:45:28,156 --> 00:45:32,627
<i>Currently 78 degrees in Nomanisan.</i>
<i>Perfect weather for flying.</i>

576
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:41,985
<i>Please fasten your seat belt.</i>
<i>We're beginning our descent.</i>

577
00:46:05,636 --> 00:46:09,709
- Hello, Mr Incredible. Nice suit.
- Thanks.

578
00:46:09,796 --> 00:46:13,152
Nice to be back, Mirage.

579
00:46:37,436 --> 00:46:40,985
You'll be briefed on your assignment
in the conference room at two.

580
00:46:41,076 --> 00:46:44,352
- D Wing, room A-<i>1 1</i> 3.
- 2.00. Got it.

581
00:46:44,436 --> 00:46:46,028
See you there.

582
00:47:17,196 --> 00:47:18,754
Edna.

583
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,475
- I'd like to speak to Edna, please.
- <i>This is Edna.</i>

584
00:47:21,556 --> 00:47:24,150
- E? This is Helen.
- <i>Helen who?</i>

585
00:47:24,236 --> 00:47:27,353
Helen Parr? You know...

586
00:47:28,196 --> 00:47:29,185
Elastigirl?

587
00:47:29,276 --> 00:47:33,349
<i>Darling. It's been such a long time</i>
<i>after all these years. So long.</i>

588
00:47:33,436 --> 00:47:34,994
It's been a while. Listen.

589
00:47:35,076 --> 00:47:38,591
There's only one person Bob would trust
to patch his suit. You.

590
00:47:38,676 --> 00:47:43,386
Yes, marvellous, isn't it? Better than
those horrible pyjamas he used to wear.

591
00:47:43,476 --> 00:47:46,149
They are finished.
When are you coming to see?

592
00:47:46,236 --> 00:47:48,466
- <i>I'm calling about...</i>
- Don't make me beg.

593
00:47:48,556 --> 00:47:52,265
- I won't do it, you know.
- Beg, no, I'm calling about suit.

594
00:47:52,356 --> 00:47:55,109
About Bob's suit.
I'm calling about Bob's suit.

595
00:47:55,196 --> 00:47:58,871
You come in one hour, darling.
I insist, OK? OK. Goodbye.

596
00:48:28,876 --> 00:48:30,514
It's bigger.

597
00:48:31,796 --> 00:48:33,229
It's badder.

598
00:48:34,316 --> 00:48:39,390
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's too much for Mr Incredible.

599
00:48:41,516 --> 00:48:43,984
It's finally ready.

600
00:48:44,076 --> 00:48:47,864
You know, I went through quite a few
supers to get it worthy to fight you,

601
00:48:47,956 --> 00:48:50,914
but man, it wasn't good enough.

602
00:48:50,996 --> 00:48:54,875
After you trashed the last one,
I had to make some major modifications.

603
00:48:54,956 --> 00:48:58,107
Sure it was difficult,
but you are worth it.

604
00:48:58,196 --> 00:49:02,155
I mean, after all,
I am your biggest fan.

605
00:49:03,196 --> 00:49:06,632
- Buddy?
- My name is not Buddy.

606
00:49:06,756 --> 00:49:08,792
And it's not IncrediBoy either.

607
00:49:08,876 --> 00:49:12,346
That ship has sailed.
All I wanted was to help you.

608
00:49:12,436 --> 00:49:15,872
I only wanted to help.
And what did you say to me?

609
00:49:15,956 --> 00:49:18,470
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

610
00:49:18,556 --> 00:49:21,912
It tore me apart.
But I learned an important lesson.

611
00:49:21,996 --> 00:49:24,191
You can't count on anyone.

612
00:49:24,276 --> 00:49:26,107
Especially your heroes.

613
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:29,108
I was wrong to treat you that way.
I'm sorry.

614
00:49:29,196 --> 00:49:32,393
See? Now you respect me,
because I'm a threat.

615
00:49:32,476 --> 00:49:33,989
That's the way it works.

616
00:49:34,076 --> 00:49:36,715
There's whole countries
who want respect.

617
00:49:36,796 --> 00:49:39,469
And they will pay
through the nose to get it.

618
00:49:39,556 --> 00:49:42,150
How do you think I got rich?
I invented weapons.

619
00:49:42,236 --> 00:49:46,229
Now I have a weapon only I can defeat.
And when I unleash it, I'll get...

620
00:49:47,956 --> 00:49:50,675
You sly dog.
You got me monologuing.

621
00:49:50,756 --> 00:49:52,633
I can't believe it.

622
00:49:53,676 --> 00:49:56,986
It's cool, huh? Zero-point energy.

623
00:49:57,076 --> 00:50:00,034
I save the best inventions for myself.

624
00:50:00,116 --> 00:50:01,834
Am I good enough now?

625
00:50:03,236 --> 00:50:07,627
Who's super now?
I'm Syndrome. Your nemesis and...

626
00:50:08,556 --> 00:50:10,194
Oh, brilliant.

627
00:50:27,556 --> 00:50:29,865
All right, try this one on
for size, big boy.

628
00:51:03,356 --> 00:51:05,790
Gazerbeam.

629
00:51:16,756 --> 00:51:18,553
"Kronos?"

630
00:51:43,396 --> 00:51:46,945
<i>Life reading negative.</i>
<i>Mr Incredible terminated.</i>

631
00:51:50,356 --> 00:51:54,793
This project has completely
confiscated my life, darling.

632
00:51:54,876 --> 00:51:58,949
Consumed me as only hero work can.
My best work, I must admit.

633
00:51:59,036 --> 00:52:02,745
Simple, elegant, yet bold.
You will die.

634
00:52:02,836 --> 00:52:04,827
- E, I just...
- I did Robert's suit,

635
00:52:04,916 --> 00:52:08,352
and it turned out so beautiful,
I had to continue.

636
00:52:08,436 --> 00:52:12,224
It's great to see you, but I have
no idea what you're talking about.

637
00:52:12,316 --> 00:52:14,307
- I just...
- Yes, words are useless.

638
00:52:15,436 --> 00:52:19,395
Too much of it, darling. Too much.
That is why I show you my work.

639
00:52:19,476 --> 00:52:21,194
That is why you are here.

640
00:52:27,476 --> 00:52:29,626
Edna Mode.

641
00:52:30,476 --> 00:52:31,955
And guest.

642
00:52:48,316 --> 00:52:49,954
Come. Sit.

643
00:52:53,756 --> 00:52:56,828
- Cream and sugar?
- Thanks.

644
00:52:56,916 --> 00:52:59,430
- I started with the baby.
- Started?

645
00:52:59,516 --> 00:53:03,350
Darling. I cut it a little roomy
for the free movement.

646
00:53:03,436 --> 00:53:06,394
The fabric is comfortable
for sensitive skin,

647
00:53:06,756 --> 00:53:10,988
and can also withstand
a temperature of over <i>1</i> 000 degrees.

648
00:53:12,796 --> 00:53:14,912
Completely bulletproof.

649
00:53:17,036 --> 00:53:19,596
And machine washable.
That's a new feature.

650
00:53:19,676 --> 00:53:22,395
What on earth do you think
the baby will be doing?

651
00:53:22,476 --> 00:53:26,628
Well, I'm sure I don't know, darling.
Luck favours the prepared.

652
00:53:26,716 --> 00:53:29,833
I didn't know the baby's powers,
so I covered the basics.

653
00:53:29,916 --> 00:53:32,146
- Jack-Jack doesn't have any powers.
- No?

654
00:53:32,236 --> 00:53:34,192
Well, he'll look fabulous anyway.

655
00:53:35,716 --> 00:53:39,629
Your boy's suit I designed
to withstand enormous friction

656
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:43,868
without heating up or wearing out.
A useful feature.

657
00:53:43,956 --> 00:53:46,390
Your daughter's suit was tricky.

658
00:53:46,476 --> 00:53:51,789
I finally created a sturdy material that
will disappear completely as she does.

659
00:53:54,836 --> 00:53:59,148
Your suit can stretch as far as you can,
without injuring yourself,

660
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:02,034
and still retain its shape.

661
00:54:02,116 --> 00:54:04,266
Virtually indestructible...

662
00:54:05,476 --> 00:54:08,070
...yet it breathes like Egyptian cotton.

663
00:54:08,156 --> 00:54:11,466
As an extra feature,
each suit contains a homing device,

664
00:54:11,556 --> 00:54:15,629
giving you the precise global location
of the wearer at the touch of a button.

665
00:54:16,476 --> 00:54:19,229
Well, darling? What do you think?

666
00:54:19,316 --> 00:54:23,628
What do I think?
Bob is retired. I'm retired.

667
00:54:23,716 --> 00:54:25,707
Our family is underground.

668
00:54:25,796 --> 00:54:29,027
You helped my husband resume
secret hero work behind my back?

669
00:54:29,116 --> 00:54:31,186
Well, I assumed you knew, darling.

670
00:54:31,276 --> 00:54:34,074
Why would he keep secrets from you?

671
00:54:34,156 --> 00:54:36,989
He wouldn't. Didn't. Doesn't.

672
00:54:37,076 --> 00:54:40,512
Men at Robert's age are often unstable.

673
00:54:40,596 --> 00:54:42,826
Prone to weakness.

674
00:54:42,916 --> 00:54:46,147
- What are you saying?
- Do you know where he is?

675
00:54:46,236 --> 00:54:49,865
- Of course.
- Do you know where he is?

676
00:56:17,215 --> 00:56:20,525
- Hey, hey. We got a man down.
- Come on, let's go.

677
00:56:24,095 --> 00:56:26,370
Are you OK? What happened?

678
00:56:28,335 --> 00:56:31,566
<i>Break surveillance and engage. Over.</i>
<i>Continuing sweep...</i>

679
00:58:08,775 --> 00:58:11,573
- <i>Insuricare.</i>
- Oh, hello. This is Helen Parr.

680
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:14,772
Bob Parr is my husband.
I was wondering if you could give me

681
00:58:14,855 --> 00:58:18,814
the number of the hotel he's staying at?
The number I have is no good.

682
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:21,614
- <i>Mr Parr no longer works here.</i>
- What do you mean?

683
00:58:21,695 --> 00:58:24,163
He's on a business trip.
A company retreat.

684
00:58:24,255 --> 00:58:27,053
<i>My records say he was terminated</i>
<i>two months ago.</i>

685
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:59,612
So, you don't know where he is.

686
00:59:01,495 --> 00:59:04,726
Would you like to find out?

687
01:00:17,878 --> 01:00:20,950
I am such an idiot.

688
01:00:21,038 --> 01:00:23,233
I let this happen, you know.

689
01:00:23,318 --> 01:00:27,152
The new sports car, the getting
in shape, the blond hair, the lies.

690
01:00:27,238 --> 01:00:30,275
Yes, he attempts to relive the past.

691
01:00:30,358 --> 01:00:33,987
Now I'm losing him. What'll I do?

692
01:00:34,078 --> 01:00:36,751
What are you talking about?

693
01:00:37,958 --> 01:00:41,997
You are Elastigirl.
My God, pull yourself together.

694
01:00:42,078 --> 01:00:44,069
What will you do?
Is this a question?

695
01:00:44,158 --> 01:00:46,592
Show him you remember
that he is Mr Incredible,

696
01:00:46,678 --> 01:00:49,476
and you will remind him who you are.

697
01:00:49,558 --> 01:00:53,597
Well, you know where he is.
Go. Confront the problem. Fight. Win.

698
01:00:54,038 --> 01:00:57,792
And call me when you get back, darling.
I enjoy our visits.

699
01:00:57,878 --> 01:01:00,267
There's lots of leftovers
you can reheat.

700
01:01:00,358 --> 01:01:04,192
Make sure Dash does his homework.
And both of you, get to bed on time.

701
01:01:04,278 --> 01:01:08,112
I should be back tonight. Late. You can
be in charge that long, can't you?

702
01:01:08,198 --> 01:01:10,837
Yeah. But why am I in charge again?

703
01:01:10,918 --> 01:01:13,227
Nothing.
Just a little trouble with Daddy.

704
01:01:13,318 --> 01:01:17,516
You mean Dad's in trouble,
or Dad is the trouble?

705
01:01:17,598 --> 01:01:21,352
I mean either he's in trouble,
or he's going to be.

706
01:01:27,278 --> 01:01:29,746
What's that?
Where'd you get that, Mom?

707
01:01:29,838 --> 01:01:31,988
You made a cool outfit?
Are those for us?

708
01:01:32,078 --> 01:01:33,511
We all get cool outfits?

709
01:01:34,478 --> 01:01:37,151
Dash, you come back here this moment.

710
01:01:38,558 --> 01:01:40,833
Hey, Snug. Thanks for getting back.

711
01:01:40,918 --> 01:01:44,308
I know this is short notice,
but I was hoping that I could...

712
01:01:44,398 --> 01:01:47,231
What are these?
Look, I'm The Dash.

713
01:01:47,318 --> 01:01:49,878
- The Dash likes.
- Just a second.

714
01:01:49,958 --> 01:01:53,712
- Take that off before somebody sees.
- You're packing one just like it.

715
01:01:53,798 --> 01:01:56,358
- Are you hiding something?
- I'm on the phone...

716
01:01:56,438 --> 01:01:58,747
- Dash.
- This is yours. It's specially made.

717
01:01:58,838 --> 01:02:02,069
- What's going on?
- You're not coming. I gotta pack.

718
01:02:04,198 --> 01:02:06,075
What makes you think it's special?

719
01:02:06,158 --> 01:02:08,991
I don't know. Why'd Mom try to hide it?

720
01:02:17,118 --> 01:02:20,394
Snug, I'm calling
in a solid you owe me.

721
01:02:20,478 --> 01:02:23,834
- <i>What do you need?</i>
- A jet. What do you got that's fast?

722
01:02:23,918 --> 01:02:26,307
<i>Let me think.</i>

723
01:02:34,278 --> 01:02:37,190
Island approach.
India Golf niner-niner checking in.

724
01:02:37,278 --> 01:02:39,269
VFR on top. Over.

725
01:02:41,598 --> 01:02:44,396
Island tower,
this is India Golf niner-niner

726
01:02:44,478 --> 01:02:47,390
requesting vectors to the initial. Over.

727
01:02:56,878 --> 01:02:59,392
Easy, Helen. Easy. Easy, girl.

728
01:02:59,478 --> 01:03:03,869
You're overreacting. Everything's fine.
They're just all getting coffee.

729
01:03:04,598 --> 01:03:08,830
At the same time. Yeah.

730
01:03:21,078 --> 01:03:24,787
You sir, truly are "Mr Incredible".

731
01:03:24,878 --> 01:03:29,235
I was right to idolize you. I knew you
were tough, but tricking the probe

732
01:03:29,318 --> 01:03:32,947
by hiding under the bones
of another super? Oh, man.

733
01:03:33,038 --> 01:03:35,472
I'm still geeking out about it.

734
01:03:36,838 --> 01:03:40,069
And then you had to
just go and ruin the ride.

735
01:03:40,158 --> 01:03:44,948
I mean, Mr Incredible calling for help?
"Help me, help me."

736
01:03:45,038 --> 01:03:47,313
Lame.

737
01:03:47,398 --> 01:03:51,914
- All right, who did you contact?
- Contact? What are you talking about?

738
01:03:56,398 --> 01:03:58,753
I am referring to last night
at 23:07 hours

739
01:03:58,838 --> 01:04:02,069
while you were snooping around.
You sent out a homing signal.

740
01:04:02,158 --> 01:04:05,195
I didn't know about the homing device.

741
01:04:09,518 --> 01:04:13,670
And now a government plane is
requesting permission to land here.

742
01:04:13,758 --> 01:04:16,670
- Who did you contact?
- I didn't send for a plane.

743
01:04:16,758 --> 01:04:18,589
Play the transmission.

744
01:04:19,478 --> 01:04:23,073
- <i>India golf niner</i>- <i>niner checking in.</i>
- Helen.

745
01:04:23,158 --> 01:04:26,230
So you do know these people.

746
01:04:26,318 --> 01:04:29,071
Well, then, I'll send them
a little greeting.

747
01:04:32,558 --> 01:04:34,708
- Violet.
- It's not my fault.

748
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:37,028
Dash ran away,
I knew I'd get blamed for it.

749
01:04:37,118 --> 01:04:41,555
That's not true. You said, "Something's
up with Mom. We have to find out what."

750
01:04:41,638 --> 01:04:45,074
- It's not my fault.
- Hundred percent all-yours idea.

751
01:04:45,158 --> 01:04:47,911
Wait a minute.
You left Jack-Jack alone?

752
01:04:47,998 --> 01:04:50,751
- Of course we got a sitter.
- We got someone, Mom.

753
01:04:50,838 --> 01:04:53,068
- We wouldn't do that.
- Thanks a lot.

754
01:04:53,158 --> 01:04:56,150
All right, well, who'd you get?

755
01:04:56,238 --> 01:04:58,388
You don't have to worry
about one thing.

756
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:01,834
I've got baby-sitting wired.
I've taken courses, learned CPR,

757
01:05:01,918 --> 01:05:04,990
- excellent marks and certificates.
- Kari.

758
01:05:05,078 --> 01:05:07,228
I brought Mozart to play while he sleeps

759
01:05:07,318 --> 01:05:10,116
because experts say
Mozart makes babies smarter.

760
01:05:10,198 --> 01:05:11,233
Kari...

761
01:05:11,318 --> 01:05:13,957
They don't have to listen
cos they're asleep.

762
01:05:14,038 --> 01:05:16,029
I wish my parents played Mozart

763
01:05:16,118 --> 01:05:19,076
because I often don't know
what anyone's talking about.

764
01:05:19,158 --> 01:05:22,275
Kari, I really don't feel comfortable
with this.

765
01:05:22,358 --> 01:05:25,589
I'll pay you for your trouble,
but I'd rather call a service.

766
01:05:25,678 --> 01:05:30,069
There's really no need. I can totally
handle anything this baby can dish out.

767
01:05:30,158 --> 01:05:32,718
Can't I, little baby? I can handle it.

768
01:05:32,798 --> 01:05:34,868
<i>Who can handle it?</i>

769
01:05:41,918 --> 01:05:46,628
India Golf niner-niner transmitting
in the blind guard. Disengage.

770
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:17,476
Disengage.

771
01:06:17,558 --> 01:06:19,674
- <i>Friendlies...</i>
- Call off the missiles.

772
01:06:19,758 --> 01:06:23,467
- I'll do anything.
- Too late. Fifteen years too late.

773
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:30,427
...south-southwest of your position.
Angels ten. Track east.

774
01:06:30,518 --> 01:06:33,032
Vi. Put a force field around the plane.

775
01:06:33,118 --> 01:06:34,710
You said not to use our powers.

776
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:36,993
I know.
Listen to what I'm saying now.

777
01:06:37,078 --> 01:06:39,273
Disengage. Repeat, disengage.

778
01:06:43,758 --> 01:06:46,272
- Mom?
- Violet.

779
01:06:46,358 --> 01:06:50,829
Mayday. India Golf niner-niner is
buddy-spiked. There are children aboard.

780
01:06:50,918 --> 01:06:53,148
- <i>There are children aboard.</i>
- No.

781
01:06:54,798 --> 01:06:57,596
- Put a field around us!
- I've never done one that big.

782
01:06:57,678 --> 01:06:58,747
Do it now.

783
01:07:00,238 --> 01:07:01,353
Abort.

784
01:07:03,678 --> 01:07:05,157
Abort.

785
01:07:35,118 --> 01:07:36,870
Brace yourselves.

786
01:07:42,878 --> 01:07:45,711
- Mom.
- Everybody calm down.

787
01:07:45,798 --> 01:07:47,789
I'll tell you what we're not gonna do.

788
01:07:47,878 --> 01:07:50,187
We're not gonna panic, we're...
Look out.

789
01:08:00,998 --> 01:08:01,078
- Who's idea was this?
- What are we gonna do?

790
01:08:01,078 --> 01:08:03,672
- Who's idea was this?
- What are we gonna do?

791
01:08:03,758 --> 01:08:05,828
We're dead.

792
01:08:05,918 --> 01:08:08,512
- It blew up.
- We survived but we're dead.

793
01:08:08,598 --> 01:08:10,111
Stop it.

794
01:08:10,838 --> 01:08:14,547
We are not gonna die.
Both of you will get a grip.

795
01:08:14,638 --> 01:08:16,947
Or so help me
I will ground you for a month.

796
01:08:17,038 --> 01:08:18,790
Understand?

797
01:08:19,358 --> 01:08:23,067
We have a confirmed hit.
Target was destroyed.

798
01:08:23,158 --> 01:08:25,069
You'll get over it.

799
01:08:25,158 --> 01:08:28,753
I seem to recall
you prefer to "work alone".

800
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:40,467
Release me. Now.

801
01:08:40,558 --> 01:08:43,516
- Or what?
- I'll crush her.

802
01:08:43,598 --> 01:08:46,158
That sounds a little dark for you.
Well, go ahead.

803
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:49,036
It'll be easy.
Like breaking a toothpick.

804
01:08:50,118 --> 01:08:52,109
Show me.

805
01:09:02,798 --> 01:09:04,868
I knew you couldn't do it.

806
01:09:04,958 --> 01:09:08,030
Even when you have nothing to lose.

807
01:09:08,118 --> 01:09:09,676
You're weak.

808
01:09:09,758 --> 01:09:11,828
And I've outgrown you.

809
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:26,875
Those were short-range missiles.
Land-based. That way is our best bet.

810
01:09:26,958 --> 01:09:29,756
You want to go toward
the people that tried to kill us?

811
01:09:29,838 --> 01:09:33,751
- If it means land, yes.
- Do you expect us to swim there?

812
01:09:33,838 --> 01:09:37,035
I expect you to trust me.

813
01:10:35,318 --> 01:10:37,434
What a trooper.

814
01:10:37,518 --> 01:10:39,509
I'm so proud of you.

815
01:10:39,598 --> 01:10:41,509
Thanks, Mom.

816
01:10:46,998 --> 01:10:49,956
I think your father is in trouble.

817
01:10:50,038 --> 01:10:52,757
If you haven't noticed,
we're not doing so hot.

818
01:10:52,838 --> 01:10:56,831
I'm going to look for him. So you're
in charge until I get back, Violet.

819
01:10:56,918 --> 01:10:59,034
- What?
- You heard her.

820
01:11:01,358 --> 01:11:04,714
Put these on. Your identity
is your most valuable possession.

821
01:11:04,798 --> 01:11:05,787
Protect it.

822
01:11:05,878 --> 01:11:08,631
And if anything goes wrong,
use your powers.

823
01:11:08,718 --> 01:11:11,312
- But you said never to use...
- I know what I said.

824
01:11:14,438 --> 01:11:18,795
Remember the bad guys on those shows
you used to watch on Saturday mornings?

825
01:11:18,878 --> 01:11:22,109
Well, these guys
are not like those guys.

826
01:11:22,198 --> 01:11:25,554
They won't exercise restraint
because you're children.

827
01:11:25,638 --> 01:11:28,675
They will kill you
if they get the chance.

828
01:11:28,758 --> 01:11:30,908
Do not give them that chance.

829
01:11:30,998 --> 01:11:33,034
- Mom?
- Vi, I'm counting on you.

830
01:11:33,118 --> 01:11:35,552
- There's...
- I'm counting on you. Be strong.

831
01:11:36,838 --> 01:11:41,036
Dash, if anything goes wrong,
I want you to run as fast as you can.

832
01:11:41,118 --> 01:11:43,586
- As fast as I can?
- As fast as you can.

833
01:11:43,678 --> 01:11:47,910
Stay hidden. Keep each other safe.
I'll be back by morning.

834
01:11:51,118 --> 01:11:52,710
Mom.

835
01:11:53,398 --> 01:11:56,276
Mom, what happened on the plane.
I'm sorry.

836
01:11:56,358 --> 01:11:59,509
I wanted to help.
When you asked me to... I'm sorry.

837
01:11:59,598 --> 01:12:05,150
It isn't your fault. It wasn't fair
for me to suddenly ask so much of you.

838
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:07,468
But things are different now.

839
01:12:07,558 --> 01:12:10,436
And doubt is a luxury
we can't afford anymore, sweetie.

840
01:12:10,518 --> 01:12:12,907
You have more power than you realize.

841
01:12:12,998 --> 01:12:15,387
Don't think. And don't worry.

842
01:12:15,478 --> 01:12:17,912
If the time comes,
you'll know what to do.

843
01:12:17,998 --> 01:12:20,432
It's in your blood.

844
01:12:55,998 --> 01:12:58,466
He's not weak, you know.

845
01:12:58,558 --> 01:12:59,547
What?

846
01:12:59,638 --> 01:13:01,833
Valuing life is not weakness.

847
01:13:01,918 --> 01:13:05,467
If you're talking about
what happened in the containment unit,

848
01:13:05,558 --> 01:13:10,029
- I had everything under control.
- And disregarding it is not strength.

849
01:13:10,118 --> 01:13:12,837
I called his bluff, sweetheart,
that's all.

850
01:13:12,918 --> 01:13:15,193
I knew he wouldn't have it in him to...

851
01:13:15,278 --> 01:13:18,190
Next time you gamble,
bet your own life.

852
01:14:26,598 --> 01:14:28,589
A rocket?

853
01:16:17,038 --> 01:16:21,793
Well, not that this isn't fun,
but I'm gonna go look around.

854
01:16:21,878 --> 01:16:25,587
What do you think is going on here?
You think we're on vacation?

855
01:16:25,678 --> 01:16:28,431
Mom and Dad's lives
could be in jeopardy.

856
01:16:28,518 --> 01:16:30,827
Or worse. Their marriage.

857
01:16:30,918 --> 01:16:32,829
Their marriage?

858
01:16:32,918 --> 01:16:37,309
So the bad guys are trying to wreck
Mom and Dad's marriage.

859
01:16:37,398 --> 01:16:39,514
Forget it. You're so immature.

860
01:16:39,598 --> 01:16:42,556
- I'm gonna go look around.
- Mom said to stay hidden.

861
01:16:42,638 --> 01:16:45,391
I'm not gonna leave the cave.

862
01:17:23,238 --> 01:17:25,035
Cool.

863
01:17:25,278 --> 01:17:26,996
Cool.

864
01:17:28,438 --> 01:17:30,793
<i>Roger. We are ready for launch.</i>

865
01:17:40,398 --> 01:17:44,027
- Vi.
- What did you do?

866
01:17:56,158 --> 01:17:59,036
<i>ETA two</i>- <i>niner. Over.</i>

867
01:18:01,038 --> 01:18:04,474
<i>TCI clear. Condition yellow.</i>
<i>Status norm.</i>

868
01:18:06,478 --> 01:18:08,196
<i>Not responding to IFF.</i>

869
01:18:08,278 --> 01:18:10,155
<i>IRCM reads negative.</i>

870
01:18:11,638 --> 01:18:13,230
- Bob.
- What?

871
01:18:13,318 --> 01:18:14,592
I didn't say anything.

872
01:18:42,238 --> 01:18:44,468
<i>Identification, please.</i>

873
01:18:44,878 --> 01:18:47,676
- Hey. Hey, Violet. Come here, look.
- What?

874
01:18:47,758 --> 01:18:48,873
- It talks.
- What?

875
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:50,232
There. That one.

876
01:18:50,318 --> 01:18:51,831
<i>Voice key incorrect.</i>

877
01:18:52,398 --> 01:18:56,357
- "Voice key"?
- <i>Voice key incorrect.</i>

878
01:18:56,438 --> 01:18:57,996
Wait a second.

879
01:18:59,798 --> 01:19:01,516
- What do we do?
- Run.

880
01:19:01,598 --> 01:19:03,589
- Where are we going?
- Away from here.

881
01:19:08,278 --> 01:19:10,712
<i>Intruder alert.</i>

882
01:19:32,118 --> 01:19:35,235
- There isn't much time.
- No, there isn't.

883
01:19:35,318 --> 01:19:37,434
In fact, there's no time at all.

884
01:19:37,518 --> 01:19:39,588
- Please...
- Why are you here?

885
01:19:39,678 --> 01:19:44,433
How can you possibly bring me lower?
What more can you take away from me?

886
01:19:44,518 --> 01:19:48,147
Family survived the crash.

887
01:19:48,238 --> 01:19:51,230
- They're here on the island.
- They're alive?

888
01:20:04,318 --> 01:20:06,388
- Helen?
- Hello.

889
01:20:06,478 --> 01:20:08,708
You must be Mrs...

890
01:20:09,198 --> 01:20:12,986
- She was helping me to escape.
- No. That's what I was doing.

891
01:20:13,078 --> 01:20:17,549
Let go of me. Let go, you lousy,
lying, unfaithful creep.

892
01:20:18,838 --> 01:20:21,193
How could I betray the perfect woman?

893
01:20:21,278 --> 01:20:23,997
- You're referring to me now?
- Where are the kids?

894
01:20:24,078 --> 01:20:26,069
- They triggered the alert.
- What?

895
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:29,514
- Security's in the jungle. Get going.
- Our kids are in danger?

896
01:20:29,598 --> 01:20:31,589
Why'd you bring them?

897
01:20:31,678 --> 01:20:34,715
They stowed away.
You're not striking the proper tone.

898
01:20:42,278 --> 01:20:45,827
- Think they're supers?
- Dash, remember what Mom said.

899
01:20:45,918 --> 01:20:47,351
- What?
- Stop talking.

900
01:20:47,438 --> 01:20:50,316
- Hold it. Freeze.
- Dash, run.

901
01:20:50,398 --> 01:20:52,434
- What?
- Run.

902
01:20:53,118 --> 01:20:55,791
- They're supers.
- Get the boy.

903
01:20:56,838 --> 01:20:58,237
Show yourself.

904
01:22:21,518 --> 01:22:23,554
I'm alive. Yeah.

905
01:23:33,238 --> 01:23:35,957
I should've told you I was fired,
I admit it.

906
01:23:36,038 --> 01:23:39,030
- I didn't want you to worry.
- You didn't want me to worry?

907
01:23:39,118 --> 01:23:41,586
We're running for our lives
through a jungle.

908
01:23:41,678 --> 01:23:45,034
You keep trying to pick a fight,
but I'm just happy you're alive.

909
01:23:46,918 --> 01:23:49,751
I know you're there,
Little Miss Disappear.

910
01:24:01,678 --> 01:24:03,634
You can't hide from me.

911
01:24:09,598 --> 01:24:11,828
- There you are.
- Hey.

912
01:24:15,918 --> 01:24:18,273
Don't touch my sister.

913
01:24:25,198 --> 01:24:27,234
- How are you doing that?
- I don't know.

914
01:24:27,318 --> 01:24:28,956
Whatever you do, don't stop.

915
01:24:44,718 --> 01:24:46,470
Mom. Dad.

916
01:24:48,278 --> 01:24:49,472
Kids.

917
01:24:49,558 --> 01:24:51,276
You're all right.

918
01:24:51,358 --> 01:24:54,156
- We were worried.
- I thought I'd never see you again.

919
01:25:11,598 --> 01:25:13,111
I love you.

920
01:25:28,158 --> 01:25:29,716
Time-out.

921
01:25:31,398 --> 01:25:34,515
What have we here?
Matching uniforms?

922
01:25:35,278 --> 01:25:38,668
Oh, no. Elastigirl?

923
01:25:40,198 --> 01:25:42,666
You married Elastigirl?

924
01:25:44,358 --> 01:25:46,588
And got busy.

925
01:25:46,678 --> 01:25:49,272
It's a whole family of supers.

926
01:25:49,358 --> 01:25:51,428
Looks like I've hit the jackpot.

927
01:25:52,038 --> 01:25:53,710
This is just too good.

928
01:25:53,798 --> 01:25:57,313
- <i>The ship's unique design...</i>
- <i>There were no fatalities...</i>

929
01:25:58,838 --> 01:26:02,035
Oh, come on.
You gotta admit, this is cool.

930
01:26:02,118 --> 01:26:05,315
Just like a movie.
The robot will emerge dramatically,

931
01:26:05,398 --> 01:26:08,151
do some damage.
Throngs of screaming people.

932
01:26:08,238 --> 01:26:12,789
And just when all hope is lost,
Syndrome will save the day.

933
01:26:12,878 --> 01:26:15,312
I'll be a bigger hero
than you ever were.

934
01:26:15,398 --> 01:26:19,232
You mean you killed off real heroes
so that you could pretend to be one?

935
01:26:19,318 --> 01:26:22,037
I'm real.
Real enough to defeat you.

936
01:26:22,118 --> 01:26:26,191
I did it without your precious gifts,
your oh-so-special powers.

937
01:26:26,278 --> 01:26:30,715
I'll give them heroics. The most
spectacular heroics anyone's ever seen.

938
01:26:30,798 --> 01:26:34,029
And when I'm old and I've had my fun,
I'll sell my inventions

939
01:26:34,118 --> 01:26:38,509
so that everyone can be superheroes.
Everyone can be super.

940
01:26:38,598 --> 01:26:41,317
And when everyone's super...

941
01:26:43,598 --> 01:26:45,316
...no one will be.

942
01:27:06,118 --> 01:27:08,109
Take cover.

943
01:27:09,598 --> 01:27:11,589
Fire at will.

944
01:27:19,558 --> 01:27:21,549
<i>It's overwhelming the tanks.</i>

945
01:27:21,638 --> 01:27:22,991
I'm sorry.

946
01:27:23,078 --> 01:27:26,957
This is my fault.
I've been a lousy father.

947
01:27:27,038 --> 01:27:30,633
Blind to what I have.
So obsessed with being undervalued

948
01:27:30,718 --> 01:27:33,676
- that I undervalued all of you.
- Dad?

949
01:27:33,758 --> 01:27:34,747
Don't interrupt.

950
01:27:34,838 --> 01:27:37,511
So caught up in the past that I...

951
01:27:38,998 --> 01:27:42,707
You are my greatest adventure.
And I almost missed it.

952
01:27:42,798 --> 01:27:45,676
I swear, I'm gonna get us
out of this safely if I...

953
01:27:45,758 --> 01:27:49,387
Well, I think Dad has made
some excellent progress today

954
01:27:49,478 --> 01:27:52,117
but I think it's time we wind down now.

955
01:27:54,678 --> 01:27:56,669
We need to get back to the mainland.

956
01:27:56,758 --> 01:27:59,113
I saw an aircraft hangar on my way in.

957
01:28:08,638 --> 01:28:10,310
Where are all the guards?

958
01:28:10,398 --> 01:28:11,797
Go, go.

959
01:28:15,558 --> 01:28:18,550
Hey, every time they run,
you take a shot.

960
01:28:34,038 --> 01:28:36,632
This is the right hangar,
but I don't see any jets.

961
01:28:36,718 --> 01:28:39,551
- A jet's not fast enough.
- What's faster than a jet?

962
01:28:39,638 --> 01:28:41,629
How about a rocket?

963
01:28:44,318 --> 01:28:48,197
- Great. I can't fly a rocket.
- You don't have to.

964
01:28:48,278 --> 01:28:50,951
Use the coordinates
from the last launch.

965
01:28:52,718 --> 01:28:56,233
Wait. I bet Syndrome's changed
the password by now.

966
01:28:56,318 --> 01:28:58,957
- How do I get into the computer?
- <i>Say please.</i>

967
01:29:14,078 --> 01:29:15,989
- Honey?
- What?

968
01:29:16,078 --> 01:29:17,909
- Where is my supersuit?
- What?

969
01:29:17,998 --> 01:29:21,388
Where is my supersuit?

970
01:29:21,478 --> 01:29:24,311
- I put it away.
- Where?

971
01:29:24,398 --> 01:29:26,673
Why do you need to know?

972
01:29:26,758 --> 01:29:27,747
I need it.

973
01:29:27,838 --> 01:29:30,796
Don't think about running off
to doing no derrin'-do.

974
01:29:30,878 --> 01:29:33,108
We've planned this dinner
for two months.

975
01:29:33,198 --> 01:29:35,871
- The public is in danger.
- My evening's in danger.

976
01:29:35,958 --> 01:29:39,553
Tell me where my suit is.
We are talking about the greater good.

977
01:29:39,638 --> 01:29:41,629
"Greater good"? I am your wife.

978
01:29:41,718 --> 01:29:44,630
I'm the greatest good
you are ever gonna get.

979
01:29:47,958 --> 01:29:48,947
Run.

980
01:29:50,998 --> 01:29:52,351
My baby.

981
01:29:56,278 --> 01:29:58,712
- The supers have returned.
- Is that Fironic?

982
01:29:58,798 --> 01:30:02,188
- Fironic?
- No, Fironic has a different outfit.

983
01:30:02,278 --> 01:30:06,874
No, no, I'm a new superhero.
I'm Syndrome.

984
01:30:09,718 --> 01:30:11,151
All right, stand back.

985
01:30:15,238 --> 01:30:19,789
Someone needs to teach
this hunk of metal a few manners.

986
01:30:48,278 --> 01:30:51,953
- Are we there yet?
- We get there when we get there.

987
01:30:53,878 --> 01:30:55,948
How you doing, honey?

988
01:30:56,038 --> 01:30:58,836
Do I have to answer?

989
01:31:00,798 --> 01:31:03,915
Kids, strap yourselves down
like I told you.

990
01:31:07,598 --> 01:31:09,589
Here we go, honey.

991
01:31:10,118 --> 01:31:13,428
Ready, Violet? Ready?

992
01:31:13,518 --> 01:31:14,667
Now.

993
01:31:17,598 --> 01:31:19,031
This is gonna be rough.

994
01:31:26,078 --> 01:31:28,433
It's in the financial district.
Which exit?

995
01:31:28,518 --> 01:31:29,507
Traction Avenue.

996
01:31:29,598 --> 01:31:33,113
- That's downtown. What about Seventh?
- Don't take Seventh.

997
01:31:33,198 --> 01:31:35,712
- We missed it.
- Ask how to get there, I told you.

998
01:31:35,798 --> 01:31:37,595
- Traction.
- That's downtown.

999
01:31:37,678 --> 01:31:39,270
Get in the right lane. Signal.

1000
01:31:39,358 --> 01:31:41,553
- Not Traction.
- You're gonna miss it.

1001
01:32:07,038 --> 01:32:09,598
Is everybody OK back there?

1002
01:32:09,678 --> 01:32:13,193
- Super-duper, Dad.
- Let's do that again.

1003
01:32:15,718 --> 01:32:18,755
Wait here and stay hidden.
I'm going in.

1004
01:32:19,598 --> 01:32:21,987
While I watch helplessly
from the sidelines?

1005
01:32:22,078 --> 01:32:24,717
- I don't think so.
- I'm asking you to wait there.

1006
01:32:24,798 --> 01:32:28,996
I'm telling you not a chance.
I'm with you for better or worse.

1007
01:32:29,078 --> 01:32:30,989
I have to do this alone.

1008
01:32:31,078 --> 01:32:33,114
- What is this to you? Playtime?
- No.

1009
01:32:33,198 --> 01:32:34,995
- So you can be Mr Incredible?
- No.

1010
01:32:35,078 --> 01:32:36,352
- Then what?
- I'm not...

1011
01:32:36,438 --> 01:32:39,316
- I'm not strong enough.
- This will make you stronger?

1012
01:32:39,398 --> 01:32:42,196
- Yes. No.
- That's what this is? A workout?

1013
01:32:42,278 --> 01:32:44,269
I can't lose you again.

1014
01:32:45,638 --> 01:32:48,471
I can't. Not again.

1015
01:32:48,558 --> 01:32:50,788
I'm not strong enough.

1016
01:32:58,878 --> 01:33:01,676
If we work together,
you won't have to be.

1017
01:33:01,758 --> 01:33:03,476
I don't know what'll happen.

1018
01:33:03,558 --> 01:33:06,152
We're superheroes.
What can happen?

1019
01:33:10,278 --> 01:33:12,075
Vi. Dash. No.

1020
01:33:21,558 --> 01:33:22,627
Violet?

1021
01:33:25,878 --> 01:33:28,267
- Dad.
- Go, go.

1022
01:33:37,558 --> 01:33:40,868
- I'm OK, Mom. Really.
- Stay here, OK?

1023
01:33:51,238 --> 01:33:52,432
Frozone.

1024
01:33:52,518 --> 01:33:53,587
Yeah.

1025
01:33:56,598 --> 01:33:57,713
Bob.

1026
01:33:58,718 --> 01:33:59,707
Hey.

1027
01:34:15,358 --> 01:34:16,507
Syndrome's remote.

1028
01:34:25,878 --> 01:34:28,073
The remote controls the robot.

1029
01:34:30,678 --> 01:34:33,033
- Throw it, throw it.
- Go long.

1030
01:34:43,758 --> 01:34:44,873
Got it.

1031
01:34:49,558 --> 01:34:51,514
Honey, take out its guns.

1032
01:34:58,918 --> 01:35:00,067
Gotcha.

1033
01:35:43,478 --> 01:35:45,389
I've got it. I've got the remote.

1034
01:35:46,998 --> 01:35:49,307
A remote? A remote that controls what?

1035
01:35:52,518 --> 01:35:53,507
The robot?

1036
01:36:01,358 --> 01:36:02,996
It's coming back.

1037
01:36:05,718 --> 01:36:07,754
- That wasn't right.
- Give me that.

1038
01:36:08,558 --> 01:36:11,789
We can't stop it. The only thing
that can penetrate it is...

1039
01:36:15,158 --> 01:36:16,352
...itself.

1040
01:36:16,438 --> 01:36:17,871
It's getting closer.

1041
01:36:17,958 --> 01:36:19,471
- It doesn't work.
- Kids.

1042
01:36:21,518 --> 01:36:22,837
It's not doing anything.

1043
01:36:22,918 --> 01:36:25,273
- Buy us some time.
- Try the one next to it.

1044
01:36:30,158 --> 01:36:31,227
Honey.

1045
01:36:37,118 --> 01:36:39,393
Wait a minute.
Press that button again.

1046
01:36:40,638 --> 01:36:44,756
- No, the other one. The first one.
- First button. Got it.

1047
01:36:44,838 --> 01:36:47,068
- It's getting closer.
- Look out.

1048
01:36:47,158 --> 01:36:49,752
- Get out of here.
- We're not going anywhere.

1049
01:36:49,838 --> 01:36:51,476
- Press the button.
- Not yet.

1050
01:36:51,558 --> 01:36:53,947
- Hang on.
- What are you waiting for?

1051
01:36:54,038 --> 01:36:56,154
A closer target. You got one shot.

1052
01:36:59,598 --> 01:37:00,997
Everybody duck.

1053
01:37:23,038 --> 01:37:25,154
Hey, Zone.

1054
01:37:30,918 --> 01:37:32,192
No.

1055
01:37:32,278 --> 01:37:36,157
Did you see that?
That's the way to do it.

1056
01:37:36,238 --> 01:37:40,231
- That's old school.
- Yeah. No school like the old school.

1057
01:37:42,998 --> 01:37:46,149
Just like old times.

1058
01:37:46,238 --> 01:37:48,433
Yeah. Hurt then too.

1059
01:37:51,278 --> 01:37:53,553
We've frozen all of Syndrome's assets.

1060
01:37:53,638 --> 01:37:57,108
If he even sneezes, we'll be there
with a hanky and some handcuffs.

1061
01:37:57,198 --> 01:37:59,348
Our country are indebted to you.

1062
01:37:59,438 --> 01:38:02,987
- Can we come out of hiding?
- Let the politicians figure that out.

1063
01:38:03,078 --> 01:38:06,548
I've been asked to assure you
we'll take care of everything else.

1064
01:38:06,638 --> 01:38:07,912
You did good.

1065
01:38:07,998 --> 01:38:09,909
<i>Hi, this is Kari.</i>

1066
01:38:09,998 --> 01:38:12,751
<i>I have a question about Jack</i>- <i>Jack...</i>

1067
01:38:12,838 --> 01:38:14,556
Come on. We're in a limo.

1068
01:38:14,638 --> 01:38:17,357
Hey, you're wearing your hair back?

1069
01:38:17,438 --> 01:38:20,157
- Yeah, I just... yeah.
- It looks good.

1070
01:38:20,238 --> 01:38:22,798
- Thanks.
- That was cool when you threw that car.

1071
01:38:22,878 --> 01:38:25,267
Not as cool as you running on water.

1072
01:38:25,358 --> 01:38:28,714
That was sweet when you
snagged that bad guy with your arm

1073
01:38:28,798 --> 01:38:31,312
and whiplashed him
into the other guy. Sweet.

1074
01:38:31,398 --> 01:38:34,310
- I'm trying to listen to messages.
- <i>Mrs Parr, it's me.</i>

1075
01:38:34,398 --> 01:38:37,834
<i>Jack</i>- <i>Jack is fine,</i>
<i>but weird things are happening.</i>

1076
01:38:37,918 --> 01:38:42,867
<i>Jack</i>- <i>Jack's still fine, but I'm weirded</i>
<i>out. When are you coming back?</i>

1077
01:38:42,958 --> 01:38:45,267
...aced those guys
that tried to kill us.

1078
01:38:45,358 --> 01:38:49,271
That was the best vacation ever.
I love our family.

1079
01:38:49,358 --> 01:38:52,077
<i>I'm not fine, Mrs Parr.</i>

1080
01:38:52,158 --> 01:38:54,797
<i>Put that down. Stop it.</i>
<i>You need to call me.</i>

1081
01:38:54,878 --> 01:38:56,470
<i>I need help, Mrs...</i>

1082
01:38:56,558 --> 01:38:58,469
Bob, listen to this.

1083
01:38:58,558 --> 01:39:00,628
<i>I'm gonna call the police...</i>

1084
01:39:00,718 --> 01:39:02,197
<i>Hi, this is Kari.</i>

1085
01:39:02,278 --> 01:39:06,237
<i>Sor</i>ry <i>for freaking out,</i>
<i>but your baby has special needs.</i>

1086
01:39:06,318 --> 01:39:08,274
<i>Thanks for sending a replacement.</i>

1087
01:39:08,358 --> 01:39:10,952
I didn't call a replacement.

1088
01:39:16,278 --> 01:39:18,428
The baby is sleeping.

1089
01:39:20,758 --> 01:39:22,908
You took away my future.

1090
01:39:22,998 --> 01:39:26,274
I'm returning the favour.
Don't worry, I'll be a good mentor.

1091
01:39:26,358 --> 01:39:29,509
Supportive, encouraging.
Everything you weren't.

1092
01:39:29,598 --> 01:39:33,352
And in time, who knows,
he might make a good sidekick.

1093
01:39:37,318 --> 01:39:40,469
He's getting away, Bob.
We have to do something.

1094
01:39:55,438 --> 01:39:56,837
What's happening?

1095
01:40:02,478 --> 01:40:05,550
- Stop him. Throw something.
- I might hit Jack-Jack.

1096
01:40:09,598 --> 01:40:10,951
Throw me.

1097
01:40:14,918 --> 01:40:16,351
Bob, throw me.

1098
01:40:22,278 --> 01:40:23,313
No.

1099
01:40:25,838 --> 01:40:29,228
This isn't the end of it.
I will get your son, eventually.

1100
01:40:29,318 --> 01:40:30,592
I'll get your son.

1101
01:40:32,278 --> 01:40:33,393
Oh, no.

1102
01:40:44,278 --> 01:40:47,953
Look at Mommy, honey.
Don't look down. Mommy's got you.

1103
01:40:48,038 --> 01:40:50,506
Everything is all right.

1104
01:41:04,838 --> 01:41:06,908
That's my girl.

1105
01:41:06,998 --> 01:41:09,637
Does this mean we have to move again?

1106
01:41:12,598 --> 01:41:13,997
Oh, man.

1107
01:41:14,078 --> 01:41:16,751
That was totally wicked.

1108
01:41:33,036 --> 01:41:35,834
Do we have to have cheerleaders
at the track meet?

1109
01:41:35,916 --> 01:41:38,828
- What is that all about?
- I thought it was more...

1110
01:41:40,436 --> 01:41:42,745
- You're Violet, right?
- That's me.

1111
01:41:42,836 --> 01:41:44,792
- See you, Vi.
- You look different.

1112
01:41:44,876 --> 01:41:48,073
I feel different. Is different OK?

1113
01:41:48,156 --> 01:41:51,228
Different is great.

1114
01:41:51,316 --> 01:41:53,511
Would you...

1115
01:41:53,596 --> 01:41:55,632
- Yeah?
- Do you think maybe you and I...

1116
01:41:55,716 --> 01:41:58,230
- Yeah?
- You know, do you...

1117
01:41:58,316 --> 01:42:01,069
I like movies.
I'll buy the popcorn. OK?

1118
01:42:01,156 --> 01:42:04,831
A movie. There you go. Yeah.

1119
01:42:04,916 --> 01:42:07,669
- Wait, so Friday?
- Friday.

1120
01:42:11,516 --> 01:42:12,665
- Go, Dash, go.
- Run.

1121
01:42:14,476 --> 01:42:16,751
Come on, run. Pick up the pace.

1122
01:42:16,836 --> 01:42:18,110
Run.

1123
01:42:18,196 --> 01:42:19,470
Pull back.

1124
01:42:19,556 --> 01:42:22,275
Pace it. Slow down just a little bit.

1125
01:42:22,356 --> 01:42:25,075
- Make it close.
- Second.

1126
01:42:25,156 --> 01:42:26,635
Close second, yeah.

1127
01:42:30,796 --> 01:42:33,026
That's my boy.

1128
01:42:33,116 --> 01:42:34,788
Dash, I'm so proud of you.

1129
01:42:34,876 --> 01:42:37,390
I didn't know what the heck
you wanted me to do.

1130
01:42:49,196 --> 01:42:52,029
Behold the Underminer.

1131
01:42:52,556 --> 01:42:54,911
I am always beneath you,

1132
01:42:54,996 --> 01:42:58,386
but nothing is beneath me.

1133
01:42:58,476 --> 01:43:04,506
I hereby declare war
on peace and happiness.

1134
01:43:04,596 --> 01:43:08,635
Soon all will tremble before me.
