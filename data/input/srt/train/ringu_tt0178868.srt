1
00:00:10,528 --> 00:00:13,197
(rain patering)

2
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,049
TEENAGED GIRL:
I hate television.

3
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,383
Gives me headaches.

4
00:00:32,425 --> 00:00:33,468
(woman on TV):
...makes your

5
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:34,385
color-treated hair...

6
00:00:34,427 --> 00:00:35,595
You know, I heard there's

7
00:00:35,637 --> 00:00:38,264
so many magnetic waves traveling
through the air

8
00:00:38,306 --> 00:00:41,643
because of TV and telephones,
that we're losing, like

9
00:00:41,684 --> 00:00:44,771
ten times as many brain cells
as we're supposed to.

10
00:00:44,812 --> 00:00:47,607
Like, all the molecules
in our heads are all unstable.

11
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:49,192
All the companies know
about it

12
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:51,027
but they're not
doing anything about it.

13
00:00:51,069 --> 00:00:53,655
It's, like, a big conspiracy.

14
00:00:53,738 --> 00:00:55,657
(sighing):
You can pick something.

15
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,241
I don't care.

16
00:00:57,283 --> 00:00:59,160
Say hello to luscious,
full bod...

17
00:01:00,411 --> 00:01:02,789
You have any idea
how many electro-rays

18
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,833
are traveling
through our head every second?

19
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:06,834
I got a better one.

20
00:01:07,502 --> 00:01:09,045
Have you heard about
this videotape

21
00:01:09,087 --> 00:01:10,838
that kills you
when you watch it?

22
00:01:11,381 --> 00:01:12,590
What kind of tape?

23
00:01:12,632 --> 00:01:14,842
A tape, a regular tape.

24
00:01:14,884 --> 00:01:16,219
People rent it, I don't know.

25
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,553
You start to play it

26
00:01:17,595 --> 00:01:20,306
and it's, like,
somebody's nightmare.

27
00:01:20,348 --> 00:01:23,810
Then suddenly,
this woman comes on

28
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:26,104
smiling at you, right?

29
00:01:26,145 --> 00:01:29,315
Seeing you through the screen...

30
00:01:29,357 --> 00:01:32,068
and as soon as
it's over...

31
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,861
your phone rings.

32
00:01:33,903 --> 00:01:36,990
Someone knows
you've watched it

33
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:39,575
and what they say is...

34
00:01:39,617 --> 00:01:42,870
"You will die
in seven days"

35
00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:45,873
and exactly seven
days later...

36
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:47,375
Who told you that?

37
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:49,168
Somebody from Revere.
I don't...

38
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,503
Who told you?

39
00:01:50,545 --> 00:01:52,630
What's your problem?

40
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:55,842
I've watched it.

41
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:58,011
(sighing):
It's a story, Katie.

42
00:01:58,052 --> 00:01:59,887
No, me and Josh,
we saw it last weekend.

43
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:01,055
I thought you were
with your parents.

44
00:02:01,097 --> 00:02:02,223
I wanted to tell you.

45
00:02:02,265 --> 00:02:03,391
You were with
Josh all weekend?

46
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:05,059
Some of his friends
got this-this place

47
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:06,060
up in the mountains.

48
00:02:06,102 --> 00:02:08,104
They were trying
to record a football game.

49
00:02:08,146 --> 00:02:09,772
I guess the reception
was so bad...

50
00:02:09,814 --> 00:02:10,815
What are you talking about?

51
00:02:10,857 --> 00:02:11,816
Listen to me!

52
00:02:11,858 --> 00:02:14,193
When we played the tape,
the game wasn't there.

53
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:16,988
It was...

54
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,656
What?

55
00:02:18,698 --> 00:02:20,283
Wh-What was it?

56
00:02:20,325 --> 00:02:23,328
It was something else.

57
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:29,584
We thought it was
some kind of sick joke...

58
00:02:29,626 --> 00:02:31,753
and then the phone rang.

59
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:36,049
It was a week ago...

60
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,219
one week ago tonight.

61
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:42,221
(chuckles nervously)

62
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:44,557
You're just trying to scare me.

63
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:50,104
(gagging)

64
00:02:52,398 --> 00:02:53,691
(gagging continuing)

65
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:55,777
Oh, my God, Katie!

66
00:02:55,902 --> 00:02:57,528
Are you okay?

67
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,780
Katie... oh, my...

68
00:02:58,905 --> 00:02:59,781
(snickering)

69
00:02:59,906 --> 00:03:02,325
You freak!

70
00:03:02,367 --> 00:03:04,327
(laughing):
You totally fell for it!

71
00:03:04,369 --> 00:03:06,037
No.

72
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:10,500
So... did you guys,
you know, do anything?

73
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:13,753
Like what?

74
00:03:13,795 --> 00:03:16,422
Oh, my God, you totally did!

75
00:03:16,464 --> 00:03:17,674
You ho!

76
00:03:17,715 --> 00:03:18,925
Tell me now!

77
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:20,093
(phone ringing)

78
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:23,429
(gasps)

79
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:25,431
(ticking)

80
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:27,100
(ringing continuing)

81
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:38,361
There really is a tape?

82
00:03:38,403 --> 00:03:40,571
(ringing continuing)

83
00:03:47,662 --> 00:03:50,623
(ringing continuing)

84
00:04:00,758 --> 00:04:01,718
(sighs)

85
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,052
This is so lame.

86
00:04:03,094 --> 00:04:04,220
Wait, don't!

87
00:04:04,262 --> 00:04:06,222
Embrey residence.

88
00:04:06,264 --> 00:04:08,266
(pants nervously)

89
00:04:18,276 --> 00:04:20,278
(rain continuing)

90
00:04:24,115 --> 00:04:27,410
Hello.

91
00:04:27,452 --> 00:04:29,412
Hi, Mom.

92
00:04:29,454 --> 00:04:30,413
(sighs angrily)

93
00:04:30,455 --> 00:04:31,372
(chuckles)

94
00:04:31,414 --> 00:04:32,540
Yeah, that was Becca.

95
00:04:32,582 --> 00:04:33,708
My mom says hi.

96
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,876
She's glad you're here.

97
00:04:34,917 --> 00:04:37,045
Ask her where she keeps
the Vicodin.

98
00:04:37,086 --> 00:04:38,212
(chuckles)

99
00:04:38,254 --> 00:04:40,214
Yeah, we're about
to go to sleep.

100
00:04:40,256 --> 00:04:43,384
Okay. Yeah, I will.

101
00:04:43,426 --> 00:04:47,513
Okay! Okay, yeah, yeah, I will.

102
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:50,516
No, I won't.

103
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:51,851
Bye, Mom.

104
00:04:51,893 --> 00:04:54,187
(beeps)

105
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:56,773
(TVstatic blaring)

106
00:05:05,907 --> 00:05:07,909
(static continuing)

107
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:19,212
Becca, quit being a bitch.

108
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:20,713
Where's the remote?

109
00:05:26,678 --> 00:05:30,556
(rain continuing)

110
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:33,559
(TVstatic resumes)

111
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,944
(static continues)

112
00:05:46,072 --> 00:05:47,949
Becca, quit it!

113
00:05:48,074 --> 00:05:50,576
(static continues)

114
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:55,248
(whimpers)

115
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:59,294
(panting nervously)

116
00:05:59,335 --> 00:06:00,545
(sighs)

117
00:06:00,586 --> 00:06:03,923
(gasps) (eerie rumbling)

118
00:06:23,735 --> 00:06:26,696
(panting)

119
00:06:26,738 --> 00:06:28,698
(whimpers softly)

120
00:06:33,244 --> 00:06:36,080
(whimpers)
(thump)

121
00:06:45,923 --> 00:06:48,843
Becca, can you hear me?

122
00:06:48,885 --> 00:06:51,888
(panting)

123
00:06:56,351 --> 00:06:58,311
(static hissing)

124
00:07:08,363 --> 00:07:10,323
(hissing continuing)

125
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:19,540
(breathing nervously)

126
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:28,800
(high-pitched
electronic whine)

127
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:31,302
(static blaring)

128
00:07:31,594 --> 00:07:33,346
(rain continuing)

129
00:07:43,523 --> 00:07:46,693
(rain patering)

130
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:48,027
(distant door opens)

131
00:07:48,027 --> 00:07:49,821
WOMAN:
Don't tell me what to write!

132
00:07:49,862 --> 00:07:51,990
That asshole's screaming
for my attention

133
00:07:52,031 --> 00:07:54,242
and I'm not going
to give it to him.

134
00:07:54,284 --> 00:07:55,660
I am being objective!

135
00:07:55,702 --> 00:07:57,745
Listen, Harvey,
you punctilious prick

136
00:07:57,787 --> 00:07:58,871
you touch my column

137
00:07:58,913 --> 00:08:01,708
and I'm coming down there
and poking your eye out

138
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:04,335
with that little red pencil
you like so much!

139
00:08:04,377 --> 00:08:05,628
Harvey?

140
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,338
Shit!

141
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,343
Hey...

142
00:08:12,385 --> 00:08:14,679
Hey.

143
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:16,514
Sorry I'm late.

144
00:08:16,556 --> 00:08:18,516
No worries.

145
00:08:18,558 --> 00:08:20,518
I'll wait in the car.

146
00:08:22,562 --> 00:08:24,939
Have you got a moment,
Ms. Keller?

147
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:26,107
Um, sure.

148
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:27,609
Call me Rachel.

149
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,235
Please, sit down.

150
00:08:29,277 --> 00:08:31,988
He certainly is
very independent, isn't he?

151
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,489
Oh, yeah, he sure is.

152
00:08:33,531 --> 00:08:35,742
I never have to tell him
to do anything.

153
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:37,118
Well, if that's a problem

154
00:08:37,201 --> 00:08:39,871
you'd be the first teacher
in history to say so.

155
00:08:39,912 --> 00:08:41,873
Ms. Keller...

156
00:08:41,914 --> 00:08:42,665
Rachel.

157
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,668
I know that Aidan recently lost

158
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,794
his cousin...

159
00:08:46,836 --> 00:08:48,046
Yes, and I'm doing what I can

160
00:08:48,087 --> 00:08:49,881
to find him some good
daycare. It's just...

161
00:08:49,922 --> 00:08:51,257
Oh, no,
that's not what I meant.

162
00:08:51,257 --> 00:08:52,467
By all means, take your time.

163
00:08:52,508 --> 00:08:55,178
I know they were very close,
Aidan and his cousin.

164
00:08:55,219 --> 00:08:57,764
Yeah. They spent a few
nights a week together.

165
00:08:57,805 --> 00:09:00,141
Did he talk to you
about her death?

166
00:09:00,183 --> 00:09:03,603
Well, like you said, he's
not the talkative type.

167
00:09:03,645 --> 00:09:06,314
That doesn't mean
he has nothing to say.

168
00:09:08,691 --> 00:09:10,860
He knows I'm there.

169
00:09:10,902 --> 00:09:13,363
Yes, I'm sure he does

170
00:09:13,404 --> 00:09:17,659
but he may be expressing himself
in... other ways.

171
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,453
I'd like to show you something.

172
00:09:30,713 --> 00:09:33,132
That's his cousin.

173
00:09:33,132 --> 00:09:34,801
That's Katie.

174
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:38,888
Ms. Keller...
I'm bothered by these drawings.

175
00:09:41,683 --> 00:09:44,727
Listen, I appreciate
your concern

176
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:48,189
but my son lost his best
friend three nights ago.

177
00:09:48,231 --> 00:09:50,149
He's just trying
to deal with it.

178
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:52,568
Yes, I understand,
but these pictures...

179
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,195
Are Aidan's way
of working it out...

180
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,989
of expressing himself,
like you said.

181
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,657
(keys jingling)

182
00:09:57,699 --> 00:10:00,201
He'll be okay.

183
00:10:02,328 --> 00:10:04,998
You say she died
three nights ago?

184
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,499
Yeah, that's right.

185
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:09,711
Aidan drew these last week.

186
00:10:12,297 --> 00:10:15,300

187
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,811

188
00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:36,654
What?

189
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,365
Nothing.

190
00:10:48,499 --> 00:10:50,460
Shall we read something?

191
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:52,003
I'm kind of tired.

192
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:53,212
Okay.

193
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:56,674
Sweet dreams.

194
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,262
We don't have enough time.

195
00:11:03,932 --> 00:11:06,559
Oh, honey,
I know I've been working a lot

196
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:07,644
and I'm sorry

197
00:11:07,685 --> 00:11:10,688
but I promise you,
I'm going to make it up to you.

198
00:11:10,772 --> 00:11:12,899
I'm not talking about that.

199
00:11:12,941 --> 00:11:16,069
I'm talking about
time before we die.

200
00:11:18,112 --> 00:11:19,572
You have lots of time.

201
00:11:19,614 --> 00:11:22,075
So, you know when I'm going
to die?

202
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:23,076
No.

203
00:11:23,117 --> 00:11:24,577
No one does

204
00:11:24,619 --> 00:11:27,580
but I know you don't have
to worry about it.

205
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:30,291
Katie knew.

206
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,793
She told me.

207
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:34,379
Katie told you she was going
to die?

208
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,131
She said she didn't
have enough time.

209
00:11:40,218 --> 00:11:42,261
Good night, Rachel.

210
00:11:55,275 --> 00:11:59,237
(traffic passing)

211
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,781
RACHEL:
Oh, shit!

212
00:12:01,823 --> 00:12:04,492
(grunting)

213
00:12:04,534 --> 00:12:06,661
Aidan...

214
00:12:08,538 --> 00:12:09,747
Goddamn it!

215
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:11,082
Honey?!

216
00:12:11,124 --> 00:12:14,168
Have you seen my black dress?

217
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,212
Aidan?

218
00:12:16,254 --> 00:12:18,589
Have you seen my black...

219
00:12:18,631 --> 00:12:20,591
dress?

220
00:12:23,594 --> 00:12:25,305
It's a little wrinkled.

221
00:12:30,643 --> 00:12:32,312
It's fine.

222
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,737

00:13:12,352 --> 00:13:14,020
Yeah. Thank you.

228
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,382
Kids don't have strokes...

229
00:13:42,382 --> 00:13:44,342
unless they're on drugs.

230
00:13:44,384 --> 00:13:46,719
So, then,
why the closed coffin?

231
00:13:50,974 --> 00:13:52,934
Oh, Ruthie.

232
00:13:52,976 --> 00:13:55,603
I'm so sorry.

233
00:13:55,645 --> 00:13:58,940
(sniffles)

234
00:14:04,946 --> 00:14:06,906
You all right, Dave?

235
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,828
Yeah, I'm fine.

236
00:14:11,869 --> 00:14:14,247
How are you?

237
00:14:22,422 --> 00:14:25,883
He sleeps all day.

238
00:14:25,925 --> 00:14:27,218
He doesn't move.

239
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,386
(dish claters)

240
00:14:28,428 --> 00:14:31,431
It's too much for him.

241
00:14:33,433 --> 00:14:36,728
It doesn't make
any sense, Rachel.

242
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:39,355
I spent four hours
on the Internet

243
00:14:39,397 --> 00:14:41,983
and I couldn't find
one single case

244
00:14:42,025 --> 00:14:45,445
of a 16-year-old girl's
heart just stopping.

245
00:14:45,445 --> 00:14:48,865
I spoke to three different
doctors and not one of them

246
00:14:48,906 --> 00:14:53,453
could tell me exactly what
happened to my daughter.

247
00:14:53,494 --> 00:14:54,871
(dish claters)

248
00:14:54,912 --> 00:14:57,498
(water stops running)

249
00:14:57,582 --> 00:15:01,502
She was close...
(sniffles) with you.

250
00:15:01,586 --> 00:15:03,212
And Aidan.

251
00:15:03,254 --> 00:15:05,882
But she confided in you.

252
00:15:05,923 --> 00:15:08,384
Yeah, but she never
said anything...

253
00:15:08,426 --> 00:15:11,304
nothing that would explain
what happened.

254
00:15:11,346 --> 00:15:13,389
But you could find out.

255
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:15,934
It's what you do, isn't it...

256
00:15:15,975 --> 00:15:17,435
ask questions?

257
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:21,814
Rachel, please.

258
00:15:26,194 --> 00:15:28,655
I saw her face.

259
00:15:38,665 --> 00:15:40,667
TEENAGED GIRL:
I knew Becca.

260
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:43,169
I mean, she was a little
intense, but she wasn't crazy.

261
00:15:43,211 --> 00:15:45,171
They don't put you in booties
and a straightjacket

262
00:15:45,213 --> 00:15:46,881
if you're just freaked out.

263
00:15:46,923 --> 00:15:50,134
Something scared the shit
out of her.

264
00:15:50,176 --> 00:15:51,386
Hi.

265
00:15:51,427 --> 00:15:53,346
(music playing softly)

266
00:15:53,388 --> 00:15:56,266
So, who's
in the mental hospital?

267
00:15:56,474 --> 00:15:57,767
Becca...

268
00:15:57,976 --> 00:15:59,435
Katie's friend.

269
00:15:59,477 --> 00:16:00,979
Oh, right.
She was the one who was...

270
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,356
There when it happened.

271
00:16:03,398 --> 00:16:07,026
So, what do you think
they were doing up there?

272
00:16:08,695 --> 00:16:10,989
Oh, thanks.

273
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,074
I remember I was that age.

274
00:16:13,116 --> 00:16:15,368
Me and my girlfriend used to

275
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,578
sneak up to my room, get high.

276
00:16:17,704 --> 00:16:20,373
Do you think maybe
she was into...?

277
00:16:20,415 --> 00:16:21,874
TEENAGED BOY:
It's not about that.

278
00:16:21,874 --> 00:16:24,794
It's about the tape.

279
00:16:24,836 --> 00:16:26,462
Kellen, don't even.

280
00:16:26,504 --> 00:16:27,964
What tape?

281
00:16:28,006 --> 00:16:30,008
The one that kills you
when you watch it.

282
00:16:30,049 --> 00:16:31,592
Oh, please.

283
00:16:31,718 --> 00:16:34,262
What was on the tape?

284
00:16:34,304 --> 00:16:36,222
I haven't seen it, obviously.

285
00:16:36,264 --> 00:16:37,890
RACHEL:
But Katie told you

286
00:16:37,932 --> 00:16:39,183
she saw this tape?

287
00:16:39,225 --> 00:16:40,685
Not Katie.

288
00:16:40,727 --> 00:16:43,062
I heard it from her boyf...

289
00:16:43,062 --> 00:16:44,731
You heard it from who?

290
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:47,984
She was dating
this guy Josh.

291
00:16:48,026 --> 00:16:49,360
He goes to Revere.

292
00:16:49,402 --> 00:16:51,362
It was kind
of a secret.

293
00:16:51,404 --> 00:16:52,530
Kind of?

294
00:16:52,572 --> 00:16:54,616
Where is he... Josh?
Is-Is he here?

295
00:16:54,657 --> 00:16:55,700
KELLEN:
Josh is dead.

296
00:16:55,742 --> 00:16:58,202
RACHEL:
What?

297
00:16:58,244 --> 00:17:00,288
What happened?

298
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,749
Supposedly, he killed himself...

299
00:17:02,749 --> 00:17:05,209
the same night that Katie died.

Time of death, Wade

00:20:42,969 --> 00:20:44,596
that's all I want to know.

326
00:20:44,637 --> 00:20:46,097
The name's Katie Embrey.

327
00:20:46,139 --> 00:20:48,308
Pull the report
and read the time.

328
00:20:48,308 --> 00:20:51,311
No, that's okay. I'll hold.

"Punctilious prick"?

330

Nice alliteration, huh?

331

You're fired.

the time of death?

(door creaks)

346
00:22:01,172 --> 00:22:03,091
Hi. I was wondering...

347
00:22:03,132 --> 00:22:05,510
Pick a card, any card.

348
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:07,220
Go ahead.

349
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,847
Okay, put it back.

350
00:22:09,889 --> 00:22:11,975
Don't let me see it.

351
00:22:17,063 --> 00:22:18,481
That your card?

352
00:22:18,523 --> 00:22:19,941
No.

353
00:22:19,983 --> 00:22:22,944
Damn.

354
00:22:22,986 --> 00:22:24,570
I was wondering
if you'd remember someone

355
00:22:24,612 --> 00:22:25,571
from a week ago.

356
00:22:25,613 --> 00:22:27,573
Was there a problem?

357
00:22:27,573 --> 00:22:28,950
It's my niece.

358
00:22:29,033 --> 00:22:31,077
She sort of ran out

359
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:32,620
on her parents.

360
00:22:32,662 --> 00:22:34,455
No.

361
00:22:34,497 --> 00:22:35,915
I have some photos here.

362
00:22:35,915 --> 00:22:38,251
That's her and her friends.

363
00:22:38,293 --> 00:22:39,961
I think they stayed
here a night or so.

364
00:22:40,003 --> 00:22:42,255
Yeah, they were in Cabin 12.

365
00:22:42,255 --> 00:22:45,425
They didn't pay.

366
00:22:45,466 --> 00:22:49,137
Had a number of complaints,
about the TV, mainly.

367
00:22:49,178 --> 00:22:51,681
Uh, reception's never good here.

368
00:22:51,764 --> 00:22:53,308
That's why we bought

369
00:22:53,349 --> 00:22:55,977
tape players for videos.

370
00:22:56,102 --> 00:22:58,396
Quite a selection.

371
00:22:58,438 --> 00:23:00,607
(scoffs)

372
00:23:00,648 --> 00:23:01,983
Mostly they're hand-me-downs

373
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:03,192
left by other guests.

374
00:23:03,234 --> 00:23:06,863
Anyway, they didn't pay.

375
00:23:06,904 --> 00:23:09,324
And kids like that
sometimes don't.

376
00:23:09,365 --> 00:23:10,908
Miss?

377
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,660
You know, I'm kind of tired.

378
00:23:12,702 --> 00:23:15,663
I'm thinking I might take a nap
before I drive back.

379
00:23:15,705 --> 00:23:16,831
(sniffles)

380
00:23:16,873 --> 00:23:18,625
I'll take Cabin 12.

381
00:23:31,471 --> 00:23:32,347
Hey.

382
00:23:33,765 --> 00:23:36,476
This is your card, right?

383
00:23:38,645 --> 00:23:41,022
That's it.

What do you think?

MAN:
Well, it's a pretty cool effect.

421
00:27:45,058 --> 00:27:49,896
What does this have to do
with the tape?

422
00:27:49,938 --> 00:27:53,107
Take my picture.

423
00:27:56,152 --> 00:27:57,445
(whirring)

424
00:27:57,487 --> 00:27:58,947
Are you going to look at me

425
00:27:58,988 --> 00:28:01,199
at least?

00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,953
(camera beeps)

427
00:28:06,245 --> 00:28:07,914
This the same camera?

428
00:28:07,914 --> 00:28:10,833
No. Scan the rest.

(beeping)

430
00:28:14,545 --> 00:28:16,381
So, what do you think?

431
00:28:19,717 --> 00:28:22,303
Well, look, I thought you said
this was about a tape.

you shouldn't see it.

(chuckling)

435
00:28:32,855 --> 00:28:35,483
No, I should know
more about it first.

436
00:28:35,525 --> 00:28:37,443
Well, isn't that why I'm here?

437
00:28:37,485 --> 00:28:39,779
So you can benefit
from my wisdom?

438
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:41,489
Four kids are dead, Noah.

439

That was very student film.

So, you been working a lot?

I'm not tired, Noah.

00:30:47,073 --> 00:30:48,366
Okay.

464
00:30:48,408 --> 00:30:50,702
That tape didn't scare you?

465
00:30:50,743 --> 00:30:52,203
No, not really. Sorry.

466
00:30:52,245 --> 00:30:53,246
Four people are dead.

467
00:30:53,288 --> 00:30:55,373
Yeah, but like I said,
not from watching...

468
00:30:55,415 --> 00:30:56,708
Four people who watched it.

469
00:30:56,749 --> 00:30:57,875
Come on, we watched it.

470
00:30:57,917 --> 00:30:58,918
We're hanging.

471
00:30:58,918 --> 00:31:01,045
It... takes a week.

472
00:31:01,087 --> 00:31:04,215
Right. Yeah, I'm just
going to go downtown.

473
00:31:04,257 --> 00:31:05,883
I got to pick up some
cameras from this guy

474
00:31:05,925 --> 00:31:07,051
and then I got
to prep this thing

475
00:31:07,093 --> 00:31:08,261
that I may end up
doing next week.

- Hmm?

Would you say that I'm gullible?

00:31:11,973 --> 00:31:13,057
No.

479
00:31:13,099 --> 00:31:14,100
Easily rattled?

480
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,143
Definitely not.

481
00:31:15,184 --> 00:31:16,269
I mean, you're a little

482
00:31:16,311 --> 00:31:17,937
highly strung maybe.

483
00:31:17,979 --> 00:31:20,064
And you ain't much
of a dresser.

484
00:31:20,106 --> 00:31:21,107
Who made it?

485
00:31:21,107 --> 00:31:22,942
Where'd it come from?

486
00:31:24,611 --> 00:31:25,903
All right.

487
00:31:25,945 --> 00:31:29,574
Make me a copy.
I'll see what I can do.

488
00:31:34,287 --> 00:31:35,246

Yeah, why?

504
00:33:34,115 --> 00:33:36,034
The numbers are all screwed up.

505
00:33:37,577 --> 00:33:42,415
The same problem
got copied, I guess.

506
00:33:42,749 --> 00:33:43,791
That's impossible.

507
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:45,376
The numbers of
the control track

508
00:33:45,418 --> 00:33:47,629
they put on the tape
whenever it's recorded

509
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:50,506
which means theoretically,
there shouldn't be any images.

00:33:55,219 --> 00:33:56,638
Okay, when you record a tape

513
00:33:56,763 --> 00:33:59,098
the makeup of the tracks
is like a signature

514
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,892
for whatever did the recording

515
00:34:00,934 --> 00:34:03,269
like a camcorder,
VCR, whatever.

516
00:34:03,311 --> 00:34:05,980
So the control track could
tell us where it came from.

517
00:34:06,022 --> 00:34:07,482
But to not have one...

518
00:34:07,523 --> 00:34:09,817
I mean, that's like being born
without fingerprints.

519
00:34:09,859 --> 00:34:12,612
Then, how did this get recorded?

520
00:34:12,654 --> 00:34:14,572
I don't know.

521
00:34:14,614 --> 00:34:17,992
But I'm going to find out.

522
00:34:18,034 --> 00:34:19,619
NOAH:
All right, take a look.

523
00:34:19,661 --> 00:34:21,871
You should be able
to see the camera here

524
00:34:21,913 --> 00:34:23,081
in the reflection.

525
00:34:23,122 --> 00:34:25,166
The angle's straight
on, but you don't.

526
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:26,960
Hmm. What's that?

527
00:34:27,627 --> 00:34:28,795
It looks like she's walking away

528
00:34:28,836 --> 00:34:29,796
whoever she is.

529
00:34:29,837 --> 00:34:31,631
No, I mean up there at the top.

530
00:34:32,799 --> 00:34:34,801
Oh, no, that's
just the tracking.

531
00:34:34,842 --> 00:34:36,427
I can fix that.

532
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:37,470
Whup, sorry.

533
00:34:37,512 --> 00:34:38,471
Wait, go back.

534
00:34:38,513 --> 00:34:39,681
There's something there.

535
00:34:39,806 --> 00:34:41,641
Yeah, you're right.

536
00:34:41,683 --> 00:34:43,101
- There's more picture.
- Hold on.

537
00:34:43,142 --> 00:34:44,269
I'm going to stretch
the alignment.

538
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,478
Yeah, it's working.

539
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,479
Yeah, it won't go any further.

540
00:34:46,521 --> 00:34:47,480
Okay, keep going.

541
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,481
No, no, no, no, let me do it.

542
00:34:48,481 --> 00:34:49,482
Wait, it won't go any further.

543
00:34:49,524 --> 00:34:50,608
It won't go any further!
Get...

544
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:51,901
- Let me do it.
- Shit!

545
00:34:51,943 --> 00:34:52,902
Oh...

546
00:34:52,944 --> 00:34:54,821
(door opens)

547
00:34:54,821 --> 00:34:55,697
Hey, Noah

548
00:34:55,738 --> 00:34:56,990
I picked up the cameras.

549
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,324
They're in really good shape.

550
00:34:58,366 --> 00:34:59,826
Did you see the reprints I did

551
00:34:59,826 --> 00:35:01,536
of that Guatemala stuff?

552
00:35:01,577 --> 00:35:04,080
'Cause they came out kind of...

553
00:35:04,122 --> 00:35:05,498
overexposed.

554
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,916
You working?

555
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:09,168
This is a friend, Rachel Keller.

556
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,795
She writes for the "P.I."

557
00:35:10,837 --> 00:35:13,214
Rachel, this is Beth,
my assistant.

558
00:35:13,256 --> 00:35:15,592
Well, I prefer
"partner in crime."

559
00:35:15,633 --> 00:35:17,010
(all chuckling)

560
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,345
She's a journalism student
at Kirkland, actually.

561
00:35:19,387 --> 00:35:20,930
Well, I'll stay
out of your way.

562
00:35:20,972 --> 00:35:21,973
I'm not even here.

563
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:27,103
Rachel is researching a story.
It's this video hoax.

564
00:35:27,145 --> 00:35:29,022
It's sort of interesting.
So you know video.

565
00:35:29,063 --> 00:35:30,898
Why don't you come take a look
at this thing with the tracking.

566
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,941
RACHEL:
You know, I'm late.

567
00:35:31,983 --> 00:35:32,942
I really should go.

568
00:35:32,984 --> 00:35:34,235
Yeah, but why are you taking...?

569
00:35:34,277 --> 00:35:35,361
I got to go.

570
00:35:35,403 --> 00:35:36,904
It's good to meet you.

571
00:35:39,365 --> 00:35:42,035
(elevator grinding)

572
00:35:42,076 --> 00:35:43,703
So you're taking the tape?

573
00:35:43,745 --> 00:35:44,996
I don't want her to see it.

574
00:35:45,038 --> 00:35:46,664
Whoa. You don't
want her to see it?

575
00:35:46,706 --> 00:35:47,749
What about me
seeing it?

576
00:35:47,874 --> 00:35:49,584
You had no problem
showing it to me.

577
00:35:49,626 --> 00:35:52,045
I did have a problem.

578
00:35:52,045 --> 00:35:53,046
You're angry.

579
00:35:53,087 --> 00:35:54,213
I'm not angry.

580
00:35:54,255 --> 00:35:55,924
Oh, no? What
are you then?

581
00:35:55,965 --> 00:35:57,508
In a hurry.

582
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,718
(scoffs)

583
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,387
Look, I'm sorry, but I'm
not going to get all worked up

584
00:36:01,429 --> 00:36:02,805
over some high school rumor.

585
00:36:05,391 --> 00:36:07,518
What are you thinking?

586
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,771
I'm thinking this is
the part where I say

587
00:36:09,896 --> 00:36:12,148
"You're a flake,
never finishes anything."

588
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,233
Then you say
I'm "an obsessive bitch.

589
00:36:14,275 --> 00:36:15,735
Needs to lighten up."

590
00:36:15,735 --> 00:36:16,903
Then I storm out

591
00:36:16,945 --> 00:36:19,322
all pissed off, kicking myself
for ever thinking

592
00:36:19,364 --> 00:36:20,782
that you could just...

593
00:36:20,865 --> 00:36:23,076
grow up.

594
00:36:26,913 --> 00:36:30,083
So, why don't we just
cut to that part right now

595
00:36:30,124 --> 00:36:32,418
and save ourselves
a lot of grief?

596
00:36:34,879 --> 00:36:36,506
All right.

597
00:36:36,547 --> 00:36:38,591
Bye.

598
00:36:59,445 --> 00:37:01,572
(eerie rumbling)

599
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,704
Watch out, missy.

600
00:37:07,745 --> 00:37:09,747
Bad luck.
You don't need that.

601
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:14,794
(wheels squeaking and
clicking)

602
00:37:24,804 --> 00:37:26,848
(squeaking continues)

603
00:37:26,973 --> 00:37:30,768
(game show plays on TV)

604
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:34,230
(squeaking continues)

605
00:37:39,777 --> 00:37:41,654
Becca?

606
00:37:41,696 --> 00:37:44,490
Becca.

607
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:46,701
We're almost there.

608
00:37:46,743 --> 00:37:47,869
HOST (on TV):
Summer, actually.

609
00:37:47,952 --> 00:37:49,871
So circle gets that square.

610
00:37:49,954 --> 00:37:52,832
We take a break,
while you check this out.

611
00:37:52,874 --> 00:37:55,126
This is how you can be part...

612
00:37:55,168 --> 00:37:57,170
RACHEL:
Do you remember anything

613
00:37:57,211 --> 00:37:58,463
about that night...

614
00:37:58,504 --> 00:38:00,548
that night with Katie?

615
00:38:03,384 --> 00:38:06,012
Do you remember...

616
00:38:06,054 --> 00:38:08,056
how she died?

617
00:38:10,516 --> 00:38:13,144
Becca?

618
00:38:23,196 --> 00:38:25,573
She told you about a videotape,
didn't she?

619
00:38:31,371 --> 00:38:33,831
She was afraid, wasn't she?

620
00:38:33,873 --> 00:38:36,793
Something was happening to her.

621
00:38:36,834 --> 00:38:39,295
Becca...

622
00:38:39,337 --> 00:38:42,340
how did she die?

623
00:38:42,382 --> 00:38:44,133
Please.

624
00:38:44,175 --> 00:38:46,302
I need to know.

625
00:38:49,389 --> 00:38:51,224
And you will.

626
00:38:55,395 --> 00:38:57,313
She'll show you.

627
00:38:57,355 --> 00:38:58,940
Who?

628
00:38:59,023 --> 00:39:01,859
Who will show me?

629
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:04,988
Not now.

630
00:39:10,743 --> 00:39:13,913
Four days.

631
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,754
WOMAN:
Yeah, well, your home VCRs

632
00:39:21,796 --> 00:39:23,089
will give you a tracking window

633
00:39:23,089 --> 00:39:24,424
but they won't
let you stretch it.

634
00:39:24,465 --> 00:39:26,926
There's no point, really, unless
you're talking restoration.

635
00:39:26,926 --> 00:39:28,136
Archives will come in here

636
00:39:28,177 --> 00:39:29,929
with these crummy old tapes
sometimes.

637
00:39:29,971 --> 00:39:32,140
Tracks totally shot...
servos can't line them up.

638
00:39:32,181 --> 00:39:33,725
But the big box here's
a warhorse.

639
00:39:33,766 --> 00:39:34,726
Totally analog.

640
00:39:34,767 --> 00:39:36,894
She'll read to the very edge
of your tape.

641
00:39:36,936 --> 00:39:39,731
Just don't force her or
she'll get pissy with you.

642
00:39:39,772 --> 00:39:42,984
Your tracking, your monitor,
your printer, if you need it.

643
00:39:43,067 --> 00:39:45,445
So, uh...

644
00:39:45,445 --> 00:39:47,905
what are we watching,
home movies or something?

645
00:39:47,947 --> 00:39:51,326
I'd really
rather watch it alone.

646
00:39:51,367 --> 00:39:53,119
Really.

647
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,038
Whatever.

648
00:39:57,373 --> 00:40:00,376
(whirring)

649
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:06,090
(sighs heavily)

650
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,846
Come on...

651
00:40:11,888 --> 00:40:15,266
(soft high-pitched humming)

652
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:17,977
Come on.

653
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,692
(humming intensifies)

654
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,952
Lighthouse.

655
00:40:36,829 --> 00:40:38,957
Shit.

656
00:40:38,998 --> 00:40:41,459
Hello? Somebody?

657
00:40:44,045 --> 00:40:45,838
(tape deck whirring)

658
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:47,465
(grunting softly)

659
00:40:47,507 --> 00:40:50,343
Damn.

660
00:41:00,979 --> 00:41:04,190

661
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,701

662
00:41:25,086 --> 00:41:26,796

(fly buzzes)

664
00:41:28,089 --> 00:41:30,550
Hey, you... you got a... ya...

665
00:41:40,393 --> 00:41:42,604
Well, that seems to be
the lot of it.

666
00:41:42,645 --> 00:41:44,188
Thank you.

667
00:41:53,531 --> 00:41:56,659

00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:02,332

Uh... mmm... no. No problem.

716
00:46:26,512 --> 00:46:28,306
Everything okay?

717
00:46:28,348 --> 00:46:31,184
Oh, yeah. He was an angel.

718
00:46:31,184 --> 00:46:34,020
L-I... went in to tell him
that it was bedtime

719
00:46:34,062 --> 00:46:36,272
and he was already
under the covers.

720
00:46:36,314 --> 00:46:38,483
And then he read me
a bedtime story.

00:46:38,524 --> 00:46:40,860
Um... (clears throat)

722
00:46:40,902 --> 00:46:42,946
He learned the word "conundrum."

00:46:42,987 --> 00:46:43,947
Really?

724
00:46:43,988 --> 00:46:47,241
Yeah. And then...
he drew my picture.

725
00:46:47,283 --> 00:46:49,410
Well, here you go.

726
00:46:49,535 --> 00:46:50,828

Hey, Ruthie, it's me.

732
00:47:25,989 --> 00:47:28,241
I'm sorry to call so late,
but I need a favor.

733
00:47:28,241 --> 00:47:29,993
I have to go upstate
to do this story

734
00:47:30,034 --> 00:47:31,744

to watch Aidan for me.

RUTHIE (on phone):
Oh, Rachel, I don't know.

736
00:47:33,913 --> 00:47:35,164
How long will you be gone?

737
00:47:35,206 --> 00:47:36,833
It's just for two days,
I promise.

738
00:47:36,874 --> 00:47:38,418
This isn't the best time for me.

741
00:47:41,796 --> 00:47:43,756
Hold on a sec...
Sorry.

743
00:47:46,217 --> 00:47:47,927

744
00:47:47,969 --> 00:47:49,470

750
00:48:38,311 --> 00:48:40,271

752
00:48:55,703 --> 00:48:57,830

761

Why, baby, why? Why?!

762
00:50:03,313 --> 00:50:05,106
I couldn't sleep.

763
00:50:10,069 --> 00:50:13,531
Who is she, Rachel?

764
00:50:13,573 --> 00:50:15,575
(phone ringing)

765
00:50:25,209 --> 00:50:27,086

768
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:32,216
Leave him alone!

769

NOAH (on phone):
Rachel?

770

771
00:50:38,056 --> 00:50:39,349
Noah...

772
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:40,808
L-Listen to me. R-Rachel...

773
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:42,810
I need to talk to you, okay?

774
00:50:42,852 --> 00:50:44,896
I...

775
00:50:47,774 --> 00:50:49,651
I believe you.

776
00:50:49,692 --> 00:50:52,904
Rachel, you there?

777
00:50:52,946 --> 00:50:54,322
(quiet sobbing)

778
00:50:54,364 --> 00:50:57,533
He... He watched the tape.

779
00:50:57,575 --> 00:51:00,495
Who? Who watched it?

780
00:51:00,536 --> 00:51:02,538
(sobs)

781
00:51:03,998 --> 00:51:06,167
Our son.

782
00:51:08,711 --> 00:51:13,508
(unearthly whistling)

783
00:51:22,433 --> 00:51:24,394
(rain patering)

784
00:51:30,984 --> 00:51:32,819
You took my picture.

785
00:51:37,156 --> 00:51:39,993
I've seen you.

786
00:51:39,993 --> 00:51:43,705
When I'm in the yard at school.

787
00:51:43,788 --> 00:51:45,790
You're there.

788
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,127
You wish I was around more?

789
00:51:49,168 --> 00:51:51,963
No.

790
00:51:52,005 --> 00:51:53,715
Do you want to be around more?

791
00:51:55,091 --> 00:51:56,843
Rachel and I were...

792
00:51:56,884 --> 00:51:58,845
Young.

793
00:51:58,845 --> 00:52:00,847
Mom's told me that story.

794
00:52:05,226 --> 00:52:07,270
The thing is, I...

795
00:52:07,312 --> 00:52:09,897
I don't think
I'd make a good father.

796
00:52:11,816 --> 00:52:14,736
Maybe it was because
my own was...

797
00:52:14,819 --> 00:52:17,989
such a... disappointment.

798
00:52:26,539 --> 00:52:29,500
Thing is, I don't want
anyone else to do it, either.

799
00:52:32,378 --> 00:52:35,173
Be your father.

800
00:52:35,214 --> 00:52:36,758
It's a conundrum.

801
00:52:36,799 --> 00:52:38,801
(laughs)

802
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:42,889
Yeah, it is.

803
00:52:44,432 --> 00:52:46,434
(paper crackling)

804
00:52:54,692 --> 00:52:58,071
(pages turning)

805
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:10,708
(rain falling)

806
00:53:18,466 --> 00:53:20,051
(door opening)

807
00:53:21,094 --> 00:53:22,804
Time to go, mister.

808
00:53:22,845 --> 00:53:24,013
I'm not finished.

809
00:53:26,432 --> 00:53:29,060
Noah said to make one for you.

810
00:53:36,651 --> 00:53:38,194
RACHEL:
You could almost draw

811
00:53:38,236 --> 00:53:40,530
a line through her life.

812
00:53:40,571 --> 00:53:43,074
On one side,
there's this happy woman

813
00:53:43,116 --> 00:53:46,828
who spends her time with her
husband, riding horses

814
00:53:46,911 --> 00:53:50,456
everything sheltered,
protected and comfortable.

815
00:53:50,498 --> 00:53:55,086
Her face, there's... light,
there's pride.

816
00:53:55,128 --> 00:53:57,297
And then, one day,
something happens

817
00:53:57,338 --> 00:53:59,799
and she takes
this hard corner

818
00:53:59,799 --> 00:54:01,843
and the light... goes out

819
00:54:01,926 --> 00:54:04,971
and then she ends up
at Eola County Psychiatric

820
00:54:05,013 --> 00:54:06,973
all alone.

821
00:54:07,015 --> 00:54:09,017
NOAH:
What happened to her?

822
00:54:09,058 --> 00:54:11,019
I don't know yet

823
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:13,688
but I think it has something
to do with the horses.

824
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:16,149
It think we should go
to the island together.

825
00:54:16,149 --> 00:54:17,692
It's Tuesday, Noah.

826
00:54:17,734 --> 00:54:19,777
I only have one day left.

827
00:54:19,819 --> 00:54:21,279
I need you to go to the
hospital

828
00:54:21,321 --> 00:54:23,197
and find out as much
as you can about Anna.

829
00:54:23,239 --> 00:54:27,243
The images on the tape
are leading us somewhere.

830
00:54:27,285 --> 00:54:28,786
Katie saw them all, too.

831
00:54:28,828 --> 00:54:32,457
I think... before you die

832
00:54:32,498 --> 00:54:34,459
you see the ring.

833
00:54:44,844 --> 00:54:47,597
(wipers clacking)

834
00:54:47,639 --> 00:54:48,681
Shit!

835
00:54:48,723 --> 00:54:51,517
Hey, Rach! Wait!

836
00:55:00,693 --> 00:55:03,196
(rain splatering)

837
00:55:06,532 --> 00:55:12,580
(bell clanging)

838
00:55:16,417 --> 00:55:19,712

(chuckles softly)

846
00:56:27,113 --> 00:56:28,990
Hey, you.

847
00:56:29,115 --> 00:56:30,742
(nickers)

848
00:56:30,783 --> 00:56:32,911
Ooh.

849
00:56:34,996 --> 00:56:36,122
It's okay.

850
00:56:36,164 --> 00:56:37,749
I'm not going to hurt you.

851
00:56:38,958 --> 00:56:39,918
Yeah.

852
00:56:39,959 --> 00:56:41,419
Easy, boy.

853
00:56:41,461 --> 00:56:43,296
(nickering)

854
00:56:45,298 --> 00:56:47,383
That's it.

855
00:56:47,425 --> 00:56:51,012
(whinnying nervously)

856
00:56:53,556 --> 00:56:54,515
Hey, boy.

857
00:56:54,557 --> 00:56:56,017
I'm not going to hurt you.

858
00:56:56,059 --> 00:56:58,478
(whinnying frantically)

859
00:57:02,398 --> 00:57:03,858
It's okay. Calm down.

860
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,735
(whinnying)

861
00:57:07,862 --> 00:57:08,821
Somebody!

862
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,989
(whinnies)

863
00:57:14,994 --> 00:57:16,287
(whinnying)

864
00:57:18,539 --> 00:57:19,666
Jesus Christ!

865
00:57:19,707 --> 00:57:20,959
(whinnies)

866
00:57:23,753 --> 00:57:25,171
Somebody help!

867
00:57:27,131 --> 00:57:28,633
(grunting)

868
00:57:29,842 --> 00:57:30,802
Daddy, my horse!

869
00:57:33,429 --> 00:57:34,639
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

870
00:57:34,681 --> 00:57:35,682
(horse whinnying)

871
00:57:35,723 --> 00:57:36,808
He's going out!

872
00:57:36,849 --> 00:57:38,309
Over here!

873
00:57:38,351 --> 00:57:40,186
Whoa! Whoa! Easy!

874
00:57:40,186 --> 00:57:41,396
Come on.

875
00:57:42,355 --> 00:57:43,940
(snorting)

876
00:57:46,192 --> 00:57:47,443

00:57:48,486 --> 00:57:51,072
No, down! No!

879
00:57:51,197 --> 00:57:52,573
(grunting and gasping)

880
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:56,995

(speaking indistinctly)

892
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:49,964
I need to see the records

893
00:58:50,006 --> 00:58:51,716
for a patient named Anna Morgan.

894
00:58:51,758 --> 00:58:54,260
Are you a relative?

895
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:55,595
Well, no.

896
00:58:55,595 --> 00:58:56,721
I'm sorry, sir.

897
00:58:56,763 --> 00:58:58,598
We're a mental health facility.

898
00:58:58,598 --> 00:58:59,933
Our records are private.

899
00:58:59,933 --> 00:59:01,768
Well, she's been dead 24 years.

900
00:59:01,768 --> 00:59:03,269
I don't think she'll mind.

901
00:59:03,311 --> 00:59:04,604
I'm sorry.

902
00:59:04,646 --> 00:59:06,564
It's impossible.

903
00:59:06,606 --> 00:59:08,566
Look...

904
00:59:08,608 --> 00:59:10,777
I've seen them before.

905
00:59:10,818 --> 00:59:12,362
I've been up there.

906
00:59:12,403 --> 00:59:13,446
MAN:
Nice try.

907
00:59:13,488 --> 00:59:16,115
The record rooms
are downstairs, guy.

908
00:59:16,157 --> 00:59:18,159

909
00:59:18,243 --> 00:59:20,703
You win.

(hammering continuing)

926
01:01:58,861 --> 01:02:00,154
Excuse me, Mr. Morgan.

927
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:03,575
I was wondering if you'd have
a moment to speak with me.

928
01:02:03,616 --> 01:02:04,617
My name's Rachel Keller.

929
01:02:04,659 --> 01:02:06,244
I'm a writer with
the "Seattle P.I."

930
01:02:06,286 --> 01:02:08,204
You want to know
about the horses.

931
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:11,874
I didn't mean to...

932
01:02:11,916 --> 01:02:14,752
It's just I wasn't able to
find a number to reach you.

933
01:02:14,794 --> 01:02:17,755
Every now and then,
a writer comes along...

934
01:02:17,797 --> 01:02:19,632
heard about what happened.

935
01:02:19,632 --> 01:02:23,094
What's left to write about,
though, I don't know.

936
01:02:23,136 --> 01:02:25,763
I was hoping you had
just a few minutes.

937
01:02:25,805 --> 01:02:29,767
Well, work never ends
around here, really...

938
01:02:29,809 --> 01:02:32,020
but I guess I got a few.

939
01:02:32,061 --> 01:02:35,189
So, what is it
you're writing, miss?

940
01:02:35,732 --> 01:02:36,816
About horses in general

941
01:02:36,858 --> 01:02:38,067
or just those that go strange?

942
01:02:38,109 --> 01:02:40,737
I read you had
to put so many down.

943
01:02:40,778 --> 01:02:42,739
Most put themselves down.

944
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:44,073
They drowned.

945
01:02:44,115 --> 01:02:45,241
How'd they get out?

946
01:02:45,283 --> 01:02:46,576
They just broke

947
01:02:46,618 --> 01:02:49,621
through the fences
and ran to the shore.

948
01:02:49,662 --> 01:02:51,247
So, they went crazy?

949
01:02:51,289 --> 01:02:53,374
It would seem so, yes...

950
01:02:53,499 --> 01:02:56,753
or maybe they just sense things
before we do.

951
01:02:58,838 --> 01:03:01,799
So, where are your horses now?

952
01:03:03,843 --> 01:03:05,386
I don't breed anymore.

953
01:03:05,470 --> 01:03:07,764
I guess you wouldn't...

954
01:03:07,805 --> 01:03:10,183
not after what happened.

955
01:03:10,224 --> 01:03:14,687
That must've been hard...
on both of you...

956
01:03:14,729 --> 01:03:17,774
you and your wife.

957
01:03:17,815 --> 01:03:20,276
(thunder rumbling)

958
01:03:20,318 --> 01:03:24,948
I'm sorry, miss,
what's your name again?

959
01:03:24,989 --> 01:03:26,366
Rachel.

960
01:03:26,366 --> 01:03:27,867
Well, Rachel...

961
01:03:27,867 --> 01:03:31,204
you want to tell me what's
really on your mind?

962
01:03:34,749 --> 01:03:36,709
Do you know what this is?

963
01:03:39,212 --> 01:03:41,172
I think it's a message...

964
01:03:41,214 --> 01:03:43,216
from your wife.

965
01:03:45,009 --> 01:03:46,177
Anna's on this tape.

966
01:03:46,219 --> 01:03:47,887
She's right there in that room.

967
01:03:47,929 --> 01:03:51,391
You can see the lighthouse,
the horses...

968
01:03:53,393 --> 01:03:55,019
Where'd you get that?

969
01:03:55,061 --> 01:03:56,896
Shelter Mountain Inn.

970
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:00,817
Is that the only one?

971
01:04:02,902 --> 01:04:05,488
I made a copy.

972
01:04:07,615 --> 01:04:09,284
(sighs)

973
01:04:11,744 --> 01:04:15,707
I've got a lot of work
to do today...

974
01:04:15,748 --> 01:04:17,750
a lot of acres out there.

975
01:04:17,792 --> 01:04:21,045
Minute I think I'm done
with one thing...

976
01:04:23,423 --> 01:04:27,051
...another thing needs fixing.

977
01:04:27,093 --> 01:04:29,304
You don't want to see this tape?

978
01:04:29,345 --> 01:04:31,055
You're not even curious?

979
01:04:31,097 --> 01:04:32,724
Curious?

980
01:04:32,765 --> 01:04:35,101
No. I don't think so.

981
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:38,605
Mr. Morgan...

982
01:04:38,605 --> 01:04:39,772
I can't help you.

983
01:04:41,816 --> 01:04:43,484
Where's your daughter?

984
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:45,236
Maybe she could help...

985
01:04:45,278 --> 01:04:47,614
I don't have a daughter.

986
01:04:47,614 --> 01:04:48,865
Excuse me?

987
01:04:48,907 --> 01:04:50,950
What is it with reporters?

988
01:04:50,992 --> 01:04:53,328
You take one person's tragedy

989
01:04:53,369 --> 01:04:56,497
and force the world
to experience it...

990
01:04:56,623 --> 01:04:59,918
spread it like sickness.

991
01:04:59,959 --> 01:05:01,002
Mr. Morgan...

992
01:05:01,044 --> 01:05:02,378
Tell me, miss...

993
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:04,964
what is it you think you know?

994
01:05:07,091 --> 01:05:09,677
Then leave it alone.

Hi, Mom.

1022
01:07:54,801 --> 01:07:56,928
Honey, the house you drew
for me...

1023
01:07:56,970 --> 01:07:57,971
Uh-huh?

1024
01:07:57,971 --> 01:07:59,389
...where did you see it?

1025
01:07:59,430 --> 01:08:01,099
Did you see it in your head?

1026
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:02,684
Is that why you drew it?

1027
01:08:02,809 --> 01:08:04,143
In my head?

1028
01:08:04,143 --> 01:08:06,980
Aidan... why did you draw
that house?

1029
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:08,690
Because she told me to.

1030
01:08:08,815 --> 01:08:09,983
Who?

1031
01:08:10,024 --> 01:08:13,194
Who told you to?

1032
01:08:13,236 --> 01:08:14,904
The little girl.

1033
01:08:18,324 --> 01:08:21,828
She talks to you?

1034
01:08:21,869 --> 01:08:23,830
No.

1035
01:08:23,871 --> 01:08:25,832
She shows me things.

1036
01:08:25,873 --> 01:08:28,459
Did she show you the horses?

1037
01:08:28,501 --> 01:08:31,629
She doesn't like it in the barn.

1038
01:08:31,671 --> 01:08:34,841
The horses keep her up at night.

1039
01:08:34,882 --> 01:08:38,469
So, she still lives there?

1040
01:08:40,555 --> 01:08:43,016
No.

1041
01:08:43,016 --> 01:08:46,227
(whispering):
She lives in a dark place now.

1042
01:08:54,652 --> 01:08:56,154
(clock ticking)

1043
01:09:02,827 --> 01:09:06,164
(puzzle pieces clicking)

1044
01:09:06,205 --> 01:09:08,166
(ticking loudly)

1045
01:09:08,207 --> 01:09:10,209
(puzzle pieces clicking)

1046
01:09:11,377 --> 01:09:12,503
(door opening)

1047
01:09:12,545 --> 01:09:14,005
WOMAN:
You're getting a little old

1048
01:09:14,047 --> 01:09:15,757
to be crabbing out there, Cal.

1049
01:09:15,798 --> 01:09:17,967
Your body's about outlived
its warranty, you know.

1050
01:09:18,009 --> 01:09:19,969
You ain't exactly
the catch of the day.

1051
01:09:20,011 --> 01:09:22,722
Oh... let's see you
catch one better!

1052
01:09:22,764 --> 01:09:23,723
CAL:
Yeah...

1053
01:09:23,765 --> 01:09:25,725
Good afternoon.

1054
01:09:25,767 --> 01:09:27,727
I'm Dr. Grasnik.

1055
01:09:27,769 --> 01:09:29,729
I think he was here before me.

1056
01:09:29,771 --> 01:09:32,732
Darby? Darby's always here.

1057
01:09:32,774 --> 01:09:34,734
Aren't you, Darby?

1058
01:09:34,776 --> 01:09:36,361
He's my son's boy.

1059
01:09:36,402 --> 01:09:39,072
Come over on the ferry, did you?

1060
01:09:39,113 --> 01:09:40,573
Yes.

1061
01:09:40,615 --> 01:09:44,285
Um... have you lived here long?

1062
01:09:44,327 --> 01:09:45,286
Born and raised.

1063
01:09:45,328 --> 01:09:46,913
Only doctor on the island.

1064
01:09:46,955 --> 01:09:50,583
Then you know the Morgans
and their daughter.

1065
01:09:50,625 --> 01:09:53,169
Do you know
their daughter?

1066
01:09:53,211 --> 01:09:55,755
Do you know their daughter?

1067
01:09:55,797 --> 01:09:57,423
(clock ticking continuing)

1068
01:09:57,465 --> 01:09:58,758
What's this about?

1069
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,426
Look, I'm sorry.

1070
01:10:00,468 --> 01:10:02,804
L-I don't know how to say this

1071
01:10:02,887 --> 01:10:06,349
but I'm seeing things
in my head... images...

1072
01:10:06,391 --> 01:10:08,351
and so is my son.

1073
01:10:08,393 --> 01:10:11,980
My son, that...
that's why I'm here

1074
01:10:12,021 --> 01:10:15,817
and somehow,
I don't know how, but...

1075
01:10:15,858 --> 01:10:18,611
it's because of that girl.

1076
01:10:21,990 --> 01:10:25,535
Haven't heard anybody say that
in a long time.

1077
01:10:27,161 --> 01:10:28,454
(squeaking loudly)

1078
01:10:28,496 --> 01:10:30,957
She wanted a child
more than anything.

1079
01:10:30,957 --> 01:10:32,083
Poor Anna.

1080
01:10:32,125 --> 01:10:33,751
They tried hard for years

1081
01:10:33,793 --> 01:10:36,379
but sometimes
it's just not meant to be.

1082
01:10:36,421 --> 01:10:38,423
Then one winter, they went away.

1083
01:10:38,464 --> 01:10:39,757
When they came back

1084
01:10:39,799 --> 01:10:41,759
it was with Samara.

1085
01:10:41,801 --> 01:10:43,761
Adopted, they said.

1086
01:10:43,803 --> 01:10:45,722
Never did say from where.

1087
01:10:45,763 --> 01:10:49,142
Said the mother had died
of complications.

1088
01:10:49,183 --> 01:10:51,936
But they had their baby,
they had their horses...

1089
01:10:51,978 --> 01:10:53,980
everything was fine...

1090
01:10:54,022 --> 01:10:56,399
till Anna started coming
to see me.

1091
01:10:56,441 --> 01:10:58,610
Said she was
suffering visions...

1092
01:10:58,651 --> 01:10:59,986
seeing things...

1093
01:10:59,986 --> 01:11:01,988
horrible things...

1094
01:11:01,988 --> 01:11:04,782
like they'd been burned
inside her...

1095
01:11:04,824 --> 01:11:06,784
and it only happened

1096
01:11:06,826 --> 01:11:08,119
around Samara...

1097
01:11:08,161 --> 01:11:10,496
that the girl put them there.

1098
01:11:10,496 --> 01:11:12,498
(merry-go-round
squeaking continues)

1099
01:11:12,498 --> 01:11:15,501
Were you Samara's
doctor, too?

1100
01:11:15,501 --> 01:11:18,296
Was there anything wrong
with her?

1101
01:11:18,338 --> 01:11:19,797
You mean medically?

1102
01:11:19,839 --> 01:11:21,883
I mean whatever you mean.

1103
01:11:21,966 --> 01:11:24,302
(squeaking continuing)

1104
01:11:24,344 --> 01:11:27,805
When Darby, there, was born...

1105
01:11:27,847 --> 01:11:32,769
we knew something wasn't right
with him...

1106
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:35,813
but we loved him anyway.

1107
01:11:35,855 --> 01:11:38,191
Takes work, you know.

1108
01:11:38,232 --> 01:11:40,985
Some people have limits.

1109
01:11:43,029 --> 01:11:45,865
So, what happened to her?

1110
01:11:45,907 --> 01:11:48,618
I referred them
to Eola Psychiatric

1111
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:49,911
on the mainland.

1112
01:11:49,953 --> 01:11:51,996
I assume she's still there.

1113
01:11:52,038 --> 01:11:54,540
You don't know?

1114
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:58,002
How can you not know?

1115
01:11:58,044 --> 01:12:00,546
We've been through...

1116
01:12:00,546 --> 01:12:03,675
a lot of hard years out here...

1117
01:12:03,716 --> 01:12:05,677
mean winters...

1118
01:12:05,718 --> 01:12:08,846
small hauls, no fish...

1119
01:12:08,888 --> 01:12:12,308
and that was long
before the horses.

1120
01:12:12,350 --> 01:12:14,394
See, when you live on an island

1121
01:12:14,435 --> 01:12:17,146
you catch a cold,
it's everybody's cold.

1122
01:12:17,188 --> 01:12:18,314
No offense, ma'am

1123
01:12:18,356 --> 01:12:20,525
but what the hell
does that mean?

1124
01:12:20,566 --> 01:12:23,820
It means ever since
that girl's been gone

1125
01:12:23,861 --> 01:12:25,822
things have been better.

1126
01:12:25,863 --> 01:12:28,700
(squeaking continuing)

1127
01:12:28,741 --> 01:12:30,201
MAN:
1978.

1128
01:12:30,243 --> 01:12:32,704
Man, we're really going
back in time, here.

1129
01:12:32,745 --> 01:12:35,248
Yeah, the lady at reception said
it should still be here.

1130
01:12:35,248 --> 01:12:38,376
Should be. You say you're
the patient's father, right?

1131
01:12:38,418 --> 01:12:40,253
Yep. Richard Morgan, that's me.

1132
01:12:40,295 --> 01:12:41,713
What is your secret?

1133
01:12:41,754 --> 01:12:43,590
Diet and exercise, man.

1134
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:44,591
No shit!

1135
01:12:44,591 --> 01:12:46,926
Yeah, that's all it takes.

1136
01:12:46,926 --> 01:12:49,262
You know, I'm
not an idiot.

1137
01:12:49,304 --> 01:12:51,764
You try and walk out
of here with my file

1138
01:12:51,806 --> 01:12:54,267
and I'll be on you
like white on rice.

1139
01:12:54,267 --> 01:12:55,393
You understand?

1140
01:12:55,435 --> 01:12:56,561
No, man.

1141
01:12:56,603 --> 01:12:58,730
I just want to watch it.

1142
01:12:58,771 --> 01:13:01,774
I'm responsible
for every file tape in here.

1143
01:13:01,774 --> 01:13:05,111
I have a system...
and I don't want anyone

1144
01:13:05,153 --> 01:13:06,946
disarranging it.

1145
01:13:06,988 --> 01:13:10,992
I'd never... disarrange...

1146
01:13:11,034 --> 01:13:14,162
Long as we understand
each other.

1147
01:13:15,455 --> 01:13:17,957
Okay, now I'm mad.

1148
01:13:17,999 --> 01:13:20,960
Does it say who was
the last person to watch it?

1149
01:13:24,464 --> 01:13:25,465
Yeah.

1150
01:13:25,506 --> 01:13:26,841
It was you.

1151
01:13:28,801 --> 01:13:30,762
Come on, come on!

1152
01:13:30,803 --> 01:13:32,764
(cell phone beeping)

1153
01:13:32,805 --> 01:13:35,016
(man over phone):
The mobile unit you've called

1154
01:13:35,099 --> 01:13:37,435
is not responding
or is outside the coverage area.

1155
01:13:37,477 --> 01:13:39,020
You piece of shit!

1156
01:13:39,145 --> 01:13:41,105
(beeping)

1157
01:13:41,147 --> 01:13:42,482
(sighs)

1158
01:13:42,482 --> 01:13:44,901
Come on, Rachel.

1159
01:13:46,319 --> 01:13:48,279
(crickets chirping)

1160
01:13:56,621 --> 01:13:58,623
Hello?

1161
01:14:02,168 --> 01:14:05,505
(door creaking)

1162
01:14:05,546 --> 01:14:07,548
Mr. Morgan?

1163
01:14:17,642 --> 01:14:19,519
~ ~

1164
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:21,562
Mr. Morgan?

1165
01:14:31,573 --> 01:14:33,575
~ ~

1166
01:14:37,954 --> 01:14:40,415
(doors ratling)

1167
01:14:50,216 --> 01:14:53,469
(eerie rumbling)

1168
01:14:53,511 --> 01:14:57,807
(inhales slowly)

1169
01:14:57,849 --> 01:14:59,851
(exhales slowly)

1170
01:15:09,861 --> 01:15:11,863
(clock ticking)

1171
01:15:20,121 --> 01:15:22,540
(ticking continues)

1172
01:15:27,921 --> 01:15:29,130
(gasps)

1173
01:15:31,466 --> 01:15:33,468
(shudders)

1174
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,562
(tape machine whirring)

1175
01:15:55,949 --> 01:15:59,369
MAN (on tape):
This is SM0015

1176
01:15:59,410 --> 01:16:02,372
Samara Morgan, hour 14.

1177
01:16:06,084 --> 01:16:07,460
Good. Very good.

1178
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:11,172
So, what is it
that's keeping you awake?

1179
01:16:11,256 --> 01:16:13,424
You must sleep sometime.

1180
01:16:13,466 --> 01:16:16,636
Do you dream about something?

1181
01:16:18,805 --> 01:16:20,765
Samara?

1182
01:16:24,978 --> 01:16:27,480
Let's talk about the pictures.

1183
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,067
How did you make them?

1184
01:16:34,529 --> 01:16:37,282
Samara?

1185
01:16:37,323 --> 01:16:39,450
How did you make these pictures?

1186
01:16:41,953 --> 01:16:44,330
I don't...

1187
01:16:44,330 --> 01:16:46,457
make them.

1188
01:16:46,499 --> 01:16:49,377
I see them...

1189
01:16:49,419 --> 01:16:51,963
and then...

1190
01:16:52,005 --> 01:16:55,216
they just... are.

1191
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:57,844
MAN:
Samara...

1192
01:16:57,885 --> 01:17:01,347
I need you to start
telling me the truth, okay?

1193
01:17:01,347 --> 01:17:03,516
Can I see my mommy?

1194
01:17:03,558 --> 01:17:05,101
No, Samara.

1195
01:17:05,143 --> 01:17:07,604
Not until we understand
what's wrong with you.

1196
01:17:09,272 --> 01:17:11,024
I love my mommy.

1197
01:17:11,065 --> 01:17:13,526
Yes, you do.

1198
01:17:13,568 --> 01:17:17,739
But you don't want to hurt her
anymore, now, do you?

1199
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:20,658
You don't want to hurt anyone.

1200
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:26,164
But I do, and I'm sorry.

1201
01:17:26,205 --> 01:17:28,249
It won't stop.

1202
01:17:28,291 --> 01:17:30,251
Well, that's why you're here.

1203
01:17:30,376 --> 01:17:33,212
So that I can help you
to make it stop.

1204
01:17:35,465 --> 01:17:37,133
He's going to leave me here.

1205
01:17:37,175 --> 01:17:40,094
Who?

1206
01:17:40,136 --> 01:17:42,430
Daddy.

1207
01:17:42,472 --> 01:17:44,641
They just want to help you.

1208
01:17:44,682 --> 01:17:47,727
Not Daddy.

1209
01:17:47,769 --> 01:17:50,730
Your daddy loves you.

1210
01:17:50,772 --> 01:17:53,399
Daddy loves the horses.

1211
01:17:55,652 --> 01:17:57,820
He wants me to go away.

1212
01:17:59,530 --> 01:18:01,741
No, he doesn't.

1213
01:18:01,783 --> 01:18:05,703
But he doesn't know...

1214
01:18:05,745 --> 01:18:07,705
He doesn't know what?

1215
01:18:07,747 --> 01:18:09,415
Samara?

1216
01:18:09,457 --> 01:18:11,584
(static hissing)

1217
01:18:13,878 --> 01:18:17,757
She's never gonna whisper
in my fucking ear ever again!

1218
01:18:17,799 --> 01:18:20,260
What did you do to her?

1219
01:18:24,597 --> 01:18:27,225
She was your daughter!

1220
01:18:30,561 --> 01:18:32,772
You killed Samara,
didn't you?

1221
01:18:32,814 --> 01:18:34,190
You killed her,
and when your wife...

1222
01:18:34,232 --> 01:18:37,235
My wife was not supposed
to have a child!

1223
01:18:45,785 --> 01:18:47,287
Mr. Morgan...

1224
01:18:49,372 --> 01:18:50,331
What are you doing?

1225
01:18:50,456 --> 01:18:52,333
The whispers... you could
hear them all the time.

1226
01:18:52,458 --> 01:18:54,627
At night. In your sleep.

1227
01:18:54,669 --> 01:18:56,337
Even the damn horses.

1228
01:18:56,421 --> 01:18:58,464
Mr. Morgan, come out of there.

1229
01:18:58,506 --> 01:19:00,008
And those pictures.

1230
01:19:00,049 --> 01:19:01,175
Oh, Good Christ.

1231
01:19:01,217 --> 01:19:02,844
The things she'd show you.

1232
01:19:02,885 --> 01:19:05,138
She's still showing them.

1233
01:19:05,179 --> 01:19:07,307
And she'll never stop.

1234
01:19:07,348 --> 01:19:10,727
You coming here proves that.

1235
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:14,647
Where is she? Please.

1236
01:19:14,689 --> 01:19:16,149
I have to stop her.

1237
01:19:16,149 --> 01:19:18,026
If I don't, my son will die!

1238
01:19:18,067 --> 01:19:20,153
Oh, yes.

1239
01:19:20,194 --> 01:19:22,280
He will.

1240
01:19:22,322 --> 01:19:24,324
She never sleeps.

1241
01:19:24,324 --> 01:19:25,450
Wait. No...

1242
01:19:26,326 --> 01:19:28,536
No!

1243
01:19:28,578 --> 01:19:30,496
(screaming)

1244
01:19:31,664 --> 01:19:34,375
No!

1245
01:19:34,459 --> 01:19:35,877
No!

1246
01:19:35,919 --> 01:19:37,337
Rachel! Shh! Shh!

1247
01:19:37,337 --> 01:19:38,588
It's all right!

1248
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:39,631
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1249
01:19:39,672 --> 01:19:40,673
It's okay. It's okay.

1250
01:19:40,673 --> 01:19:42,342
You're okay.

1251
01:19:42,383 --> 01:19:44,135
Shh, shh, shh!

1252
01:19:44,177 --> 01:19:45,637
You're okay.

1253
01:19:45,678 --> 01:19:47,138
You're okay.

1254
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:49,140
You okay?

1255
01:19:57,190 --> 01:20:00,235
NOAH:
Oh, Jesus.

1256
01:20:00,276 --> 01:20:03,738
(gasping)

1257
01:20:13,831 --> 01:20:15,667
SAMARA:
She doesn't like the barn.

1258
01:20:15,708 --> 01:20:19,629
The horses keep her up
at night.

1259
01:20:26,386 --> 01:20:29,180
She doesn't like the barn.

1260
01:20:29,222 --> 01:20:31,432
What?

1261
01:20:31,474 --> 01:20:34,477
The horses keep her awake.

1262
01:20:40,525 --> 01:20:42,527
(doors creaking)

1263
01:20:51,828 --> 01:20:53,871
(crickets chirping)

1264
01:21:03,464 --> 01:21:06,384
~ ~

1265
01:21:06,426 --> 01:21:08,386
(whispering):
Samara...

1266
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:21,316
~ ~

1267
01:21:29,782 --> 01:21:32,619

~ ~

1269
01:21:45,048 --> 01:21:46,758
He kept her here.

1270
01:21:49,344 --> 01:21:53,139
Her mother was going crazy.

1271
01:21:53,181 --> 01:21:56,392
Morgan blamed the child.

1272
01:21:56,434 --> 01:21:58,519
So he kept her here.

1273
01:22:01,314 --> 01:22:02,982
Alone.

1274
01:22:03,024 --> 01:22:05,235
Not alone.

1275
01:22:13,910 --> 01:22:16,955
~ ~

1276
01:22:27,006 --> 01:22:29,008

1277
01:22:36,057 --> 01:22:37,058
Rachel...

1278
01:22:41,479 --> 01:22:43,481
There's something under here.

1279
01:22:50,655 --> 01:22:54,033
It looks like
it's etched into the wood.

1280
01:22:59,539 --> 01:23:01,499
Or burned.

1281
01:23:12,051 --> 01:23:14,262
(wallpaper ripping)

1282
01:23:24,105 --> 01:23:27,108
~ ~

1283
01:23:29,485 --> 01:23:32,739
I've seen this tree before.

1284
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:34,616
Yeah, it was on the tape.

1285
01:23:34,657 --> 01:23:36,451
No.

1286
01:23:36,492 --> 01:23:39,037
I've been there.

1287
01:23:41,456 --> 01:23:43,917
Shelter Mountain.

1288
01:23:54,135 --> 01:23:57,096

1289
01:24:07,106 --> 01:24:09,108
~ ~

1290
01:24:13,821 --> 01:24:16,282
RACHEL:
The sun came through the leaves,

1291
01:24:16,282 --> 01:24:18,368
lit them up like it was on fire.

1292
01:24:19,786 --> 01:24:21,788
Right at sunset.

1293
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:28,169
Right when I watched the tape.

1294
01:24:33,925 --> 01:24:35,927
That was a week ago.

1295
01:24:41,766 --> 01:24:42,725
(sighs heavily)

1296
01:24:44,143 --> 01:24:46,437
We're back to where
we started from.

1297
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:48,106
Something led us here.

1298
01:24:48,147 --> 01:24:49,941
The tree,
the drawing on the wall...

1299
01:24:49,983 --> 01:24:51,859
It doesn't matter.

1300
01:24:51,901 --> 01:24:54,279
We're too late.

1301
01:24:56,990 --> 01:24:58,700
You have to help him.

1302
01:24:58,741 --> 01:25:00,535
What are you talking about?

1303
01:25:00,577 --> 01:25:02,579
Aidan.

1304
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:04,455
It's up to you now.

1305
01:25:04,497 --> 01:25:06,708
Just use the time you have
and figure something out.

1306
01:25:06,749 --> 01:25:08,668
We'll figure this out
together, right now!

1307
01:25:08,668 --> 01:25:09,711
It's too late, Noah!

1308
01:25:09,836 --> 01:25:12,213
Stop it, okay? There's a reason
that we're here!

1309
01:25:12,255 --> 01:25:13,673
- What?!
- I don't know, okay?

1310
01:25:13,715 --> 01:25:15,383
There's something in this room!

1311
01:25:15,425 --> 01:25:17,427
I mean, it's in this phone!

1312
01:25:17,468 --> 01:25:20,138
It's in this television!

1313
01:25:20,179 --> 01:25:21,139
Come on!

1314
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:22,265
Tell us now, why don't you?!

1315
01:25:22,307 --> 01:25:23,266
(grunts)

1316
01:25:23,308 --> 01:25:24,267
(clatering)

1317
01:25:24,309 --> 01:25:27,186
Noah...

1318
01:25:27,186 --> 01:25:28,605
Iook.

1319
01:25:28,646 --> 01:25:31,107

01:26:22,033 --> 01:26:23,993

(both panting)

1329
01:27:09,497 --> 01:27:11,749
Aw, Jesus.

1330
01:27:11,791 --> 01:27:14,210
How far down
do you think it goes?

1331
01:27:14,252 --> 01:27:16,588
I can't see anything.

1332
01:27:20,133 --> 01:27:22,969
(staticky blurts)

1333
01:27:25,763 --> 01:27:27,932
We should drop something.

1334
01:27:30,101 --> 01:27:31,936
(static hissing)

1335
01:27:42,655 --> 01:27:44,657

1336
01:27:50,330 --> 01:27:54,167
(both breathing deeply)

1337
01:27:58,296 --> 01:28:00,089
(rock hiting botom)

1338
01:28:04,594 --> 01:28:06,638
Do you think
she's down there?

1339
01:28:06,679 --> 01:28:08,389
Shh...

1340
01:28:08,431 --> 01:28:11,601

Rachel!

01:29:10,410 --> 01:29:12,912
Rachel!

1351
01:29:12,954 --> 01:29:15,206
I'm here!

1352
01:29:15,248 --> 01:29:17,584
I'm all right!

1353
01:29:17,625 --> 01:29:19,460
(quietly):
I think.

1354
01:29:19,502 --> 01:29:22,046
I'll go find something
to get you out!

1355
01:29:23,089 --> 01:29:24,799
Hurry!

1356
01:29:34,851 --> 01:29:37,562
(gasping)

1357
01:29:46,446 --> 01:29:48,448

(eerie screeching)

1360
01:30:09,594 --> 01:30:10,970
Noah?

1361
01:30:10,970 --> 01:30:12,513
(stone scraping)

1362
01:30:16,684 --> 01:30:18,645
(grunting)

1363
01:30:20,063 --> 01:30:21,272
Noah?

1364
01:30:21,314 --> 01:30:22,607
Noah!

1365
01:30:24,651 --> 01:30:26,236
(static blips)

1366
01:30:26,277 --> 01:30:27,654

1369
01:30:33,076 --> 01:30:34,035
Oh!

1370
01:30:34,077 --> 01:30:38,039

1374
01:31:01,938 --> 01:31:06,276
~ Here we go ~

1375
01:31:06,317 --> 01:31:11,197
~ The world is spinning ~

1376
01:31:11,197 --> 01:31:23,376
~ When it stops,
it's just beginning. ~

1377
01:31:26,212 --> 01:31:28,715
ANNA:
Isn't it beautiful here, Samara?

1378
01:31:33,177 --> 01:31:35,930
So peaceful.

1379
01:31:38,391 --> 01:31:41,561
I know things will get better.

1380
01:31:46,524 --> 01:31:49,193
(breath quivering)

1381
01:31:51,529 --> 01:31:54,699
All I ever wanted was you.

(panting)

1386
01:32:36,157 --> 01:32:39,160
She was still alive.

1387
01:32:44,624 --> 01:32:46,584
Where did you go?

1388
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:55,802
(gasping)

1389
01:33:05,812 --> 01:33:08,481
(panting)

1390
01:33:16,322 --> 01:33:19,534
It's okay now.

1391
01:33:19,576 --> 01:33:21,578
It's okay.

1392
01:33:23,621 --> 01:33:25,790
NOAH:
Rachel!

1393
01:33:29,752 --> 01:33:34,007
Rachel, the sun's set!

1394
01:33:34,048 --> 01:33:35,216
The sun has set!

1395
01:33:35,258 --> 01:33:36,467
It's past sunset.

1396
01:33:36,509 --> 01:33:37,635
Do you hear me?

1397
01:33:37,677 --> 01:33:40,346
It's past sunset!

1398
01:33:44,309 --> 01:33:47,103
Rachel?

1399
01:33:56,529 --> 01:33:58,531
Rachel?

1400
01:34:03,578 --> 01:34:06,497
Rachel, are you there?

1401
01:34:06,539 --> 01:34:08,541
(shivering)

1402
01:34:11,544 --> 01:34:13,212
I'm here.

1403
01:34:13,254 --> 01:34:15,882
(frogs croaking)

(speaking indistinctly)

1406
01:34:30,313 --> 01:34:32,649
They're going to bury her
next week.

1407
01:34:36,486 --> 01:34:38,154
It's over.

1408
01:34:45,662 --> 01:34:47,580
You okay?

1409
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:53,211
She wanted that child
more than anything in the world.

1410
01:34:53,253 --> 01:34:56,339
How could she have done that?

1411
01:34:59,550 --> 01:35:02,553
She just wanted to be heard.

1412
01:35:05,890 --> 01:35:09,894
Sometimes children...

1413
01:35:09,936 --> 01:35:14,065
yell or cry or draw pictures.

1414
01:35:14,107 --> 01:35:17,110
~ ~

1415
01:35:27,036 --> 01:35:29,038
I want to go home.

~ ~

1417
01:35:44,137 --> 01:35:47,807
I can't imagine being stuck
down a well all alone like that.

1418
01:35:49,475 --> 01:35:51,811
How long could you survive?

1419
01:35:58,484 --> 01:36:00,069
Seven days.

1420
01:36:06,117 --> 01:36:09,621
You could survive
for seven days.

1421
01:36:16,711 --> 01:36:19,714

1422

1424
01:36:38,858 --> 01:36:41,194
Come on.

1425
01:36:41,236 --> 01:36:43,071
Hey.

1426
01:36:48,785 --> 01:36:51,788

1429
01:37:18,648 --> 01:37:21,609
Why don't you just
call me sometime?

1430
01:37:21,651 --> 01:37:23,611
Unless you're renting a movie.

1431
01:37:23,653 --> 01:37:25,280
(chuckles)

1432
01:37:25,321 --> 01:37:26,614
(sighs)

1433
01:37:26,656 --> 01:37:28,658
Call me tomorrow...

1434
01:37:32,620 --> 01:37:34,956
...and the day after that.

1435

(murmurs)

1438
01:38:16,289 --> 01:38:18,333
Rachel?

1439
01:38:18,374 --> 01:38:21,336
Hmm?

1440
01:38:21,377 --> 01:38:24,339
What time is it?

1441
01:38:24,380 --> 01:38:27,342
It's either really late
or really early...

1442
01:38:27,383 --> 01:38:30,678
depending on how you look at it.

1443
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:33,181
Don't you have to be at work?

1444
01:38:33,222 --> 01:38:36,184
Not today.

1445
01:38:40,563 --> 01:38:43,524
What happened to the girl?

1446
01:38:43,650 --> 01:38:45,526
Samara?

1447
01:38:45,652 --> 01:38:47,528
Is that her name?

1448
01:38:47,570 --> 01:38:48,863
Mm-hmm.

1449
01:38:48,905 --> 01:38:51,115
Is she still in the dark place?

1450
01:38:51,157 --> 01:38:52,450
No.

1451
01:38:52,492 --> 01:38:55,161
We set her free.

1452
01:38:57,163 --> 01:38:59,165
You helped her?

1453
01:38:59,165 --> 01:39:00,792
Yeah.

1454
01:39:00,833 --> 01:39:02,835
Why did you do that?

1455
01:39:05,004 --> 01:39:06,631
What's wrong, honey?

1456
01:39:06,673 --> 01:39:08,549
You weren't supposed
to help her.

1457
01:39:08,591 --> 01:39:10,260
It's okay now.

1458
01:39:10,301 --> 01:39:12,804
She's not going to hurt you.

1459
01:39:12,845 --> 01:39:14,305
She...

1460
01:39:20,395 --> 01:39:22,063
Don't you understand, Rachel?

1461
01:39:24,107 --> 01:39:26,442
She never sleeps.

01:45:38,398 --> 01:45:40,066
AIDAN:
Don't you understand, Rachel?

1529
01:45:40,108 --> 01:45:42,068
But he doesn't know.

1530
01:45:42,068 --> 01:45:43,486
She never sleeps.

1531
01:45:43,528 --> 01:45:45,071
MORGAN:
You take one person's tragedy

1532
01:45:45,113 --> 01:45:48,283
and force the world
to experience it.

1533
01:45:48,324 --> 01:45:49,867
You spread it like sickness.

1534
01:45:49,909 --> 01:45:52,537
MAN:
You don't want to hurt anyone.

1535
01:45:52,579 --> 01:45:54,205
But I do.

1536
01:45:55,123 --> 01:45:58,459
And I'm sorry.

1537
01:45:58,501 --> 01:46:01,921
It won't stop.

1538
01:46:04,924 --> 01:46:07,468
RACHEL:
I made a copy.

1539
01:46:09,262 --> 01:46:11,764
Push it in.

1540
01:46:11,764 --> 01:46:13,766
"Play."

1541
01:46:13,808 --> 01:46:15,143
Push.

1542
01:46:19,606 --> 01:46:22,567
(high-pitched
electronic whining)

1543
01:46:22,609 --> 01:46:26,529
It's going to keep killing,
isn't it?

1544
01:46:26,613 --> 01:46:28,823
She'll never stop.

1545
01:46:28,865 --> 01:46:30,283
Don't worry, sweetie.

1546
01:46:30,325 --> 01:46:33,578
You're going to be okay.

1547
01:46:38,917 --> 01:46:42,462
What about the person
we show it to?

1548
01:46:42,503 --> 01:46:44,714
What happens to them?

1549
01:46:51,304 --> 01:46:54,265
(static hissing)

1550
01:46:54,307 --> 01:46:56,267
(static blaring)

1551
01:54:24,048 --> 01:54:26,009
(music box playing)

1552
01:54:26,050 --> 01:54:30,471
CHILD:
~ Here we go ~

1553
01:54:30,555 --> 01:54:35,685
~ The world is spinning ~

1554
01:54:35,727 --> 01:54:40,023
~ When it stops ~

1555
01:54:40,064 --> 01:54:45,987
~ It's just beginning ~

1556
01:54:47,947 --> 01:54:52,493
~ Sun comes up ~

1557
01:54:52,619 --> 01:54:57,916
~ We laugh and we cry ~

1558
01:54:57,957 --> 01:55:02,295
~ Sun goes down ~

1559
01:55:02,337 --> 01:55:05,423
~ And then we all die. ~
