0
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,440
DOWNFALL

0
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,210
I feel as if I should be angry
with that child that...

0
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,900
naive young girl.
Or that I must not forgive her...

0
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,060
for not recognising the
nature of that monster.

0
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,020
For not being aware of what
she was getting into.

0
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,190
And especially that I went
along without thinking.

0
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:54,960
Because I wasn't a fanatical Nazi.
I could have said in Berlin:

0
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,640
'No I'm not doing it. I don't want
to go to the Führer's headquarters.'

0
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,810
But I didn't do that.
I was too curious.

0
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,450
I also didn't realise...

0
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,700
that destiny would take me somewhere
I didn't want to be.

0
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:20,470
But nevertheless I find it hard
to forgive myself.

0
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,580
The ladies are here.

0
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,310
It's confirmed.
-They can pass.

0
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,470
'Wolfsschanze'
headquarters of the Führer

0
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,070
November 1942
Rastenburg East-Prussia

0
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,800
Sit down ladies.

0
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,570
One moment. The Führer is feeding
his dog. He'll see you in a short while.

0
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,340
Can you tell us... How are we supposed
to address the Führer?

0
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,540
The Führer first speaks to you
and then you reply: Heil mein Führer.

0
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,630
And the Nazi salute?

0
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,230
That won't be necessary...

0
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:42,440
since the Führer isn't looking for
a soldier but for a secretary.

0
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,560
Act as normal and calm
as you can.

0
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,680
I'll see if
he has time for you.

0
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,970
Mein Führer
the ladies from Berlin are here.

0
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:20,450
Thank you for coming
in the middle of the night.

0
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,660
Sometimes during a war
one is not in control of time.

0
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,310
Can I ask your name?
-Margarethe Lorenz.

0
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,430
Where are you from?
-From Fulda.

0
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,600
And what is your name?
-Ursula Puttkammer. Heil mein Führer.

0
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,250
No need for that.
Where are you from?

0
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,850
Frankfurt am Main mein Füh...

0
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,020
Hannah Potrovsky
born and raised in Berlin.

0
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,140
In Pankow to be precise.

0
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,780
Hedwig Brandt
from Crailsheim Schwaben.

0
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,990
And you are?
-Traudl Humps. I'm from Munich.

0
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,680
A lady from Munich.

0
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,610
Shall we start then
Fräulein Humps?

0
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,190
My Blondi won't hurt you.
She's very intelligent.

0
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,360
She's much smarter
than most people.

0
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,170
First sit down please.

0
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,860
Don't be nervous. I make
many mistakes during dictation.

0
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,500
You won't make nearly as many.

0
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,440
You're very young.

0
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,660
How old are you?
-22 mein Führer.

0
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:16,520
My German fellow-countrymen
and women...

0
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,610
...fellow party members.

0
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,310
It is I think rather special...

0
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:30,090
that after 20 years of service a man still
stands in front of his supporters...

0
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:40,000
...and that in all those 20 years
his program never needed to be modified.

0
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,780
I suggest we try it again.

0
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,150
I did it.
He hired me.

0
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,450
Berlin - 20 April 1945
Hitler's 56th birthday

0
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,540
two and a half years later

0
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,110
Take cover.

0
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,400
Hurry. Continue.
Get that off the street.

0
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,820
Take cover.

0
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,000
That's artillery fire.

0
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,690
Don't be silly.
Where would it be coming from?

0
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,820
You're right. These are no planes
this is artillery.

0
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:15,560
It's the Russians.
What a birthday present.

0
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,820
Where is that cannon fire coming from?

0
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,950
Happy Birthday
mein Führer.

0
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,560
The city centre of Berlin
is under fire.

0
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,440
Grenades have hit near the Brandenburger
Tor and the Reichstag.

0
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,380
Where did they come from?
-We don't know yet.

0
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,040
I have Koller on the line.
-Give me Koller.

0
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,730
Koller do you know Berlin
is under artillery fire?

0
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,380
No.
-Can't you hear the shooting?

0
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,030
No I'm in Wildpark-Werder.
-Berlin is chaotic.

0
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,160
Apparently the Russians captured
a railway bridge over the Oder.

0
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,340
The enemy has no railway
artillery near the Oder.

0
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,950
It's not long-range artillery.

0
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:06,160
The anti-aircraft defence near the
Zoo-Bunker reports they're 10 to 12...

0
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:10,860
...cm calibres. The Russians have
positions near Marzahn.

0
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,550
That's only 12 kilometres from the centre.
Are the Russians that close?

0
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,730
They should hang the entire
Luftwaffe leadership.

0
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,870
This is unheard-of.

0
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,030
The Russians are at 12 kilometres
from the city centre.

0
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,680
Nobody told me anything.
I had to ask.

0
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,330
Maybe it's long-range artillery
after all.

0
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,990
That railway bridge over the Oder...
-Nonsense.

0
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,850
That Himmler
such a pompous buffoon.

0
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:53,110
Party bosses everywhere.
They make me so sick.

0
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,810
The Führer starts
'Clausewitz' today.

0
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,490
Berlin as a front city.
He won't be able to keep the city.

0
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,140
If the Führer stays here
the Reich will go down with him.

0
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,300
We have to talk him out of it.
Talk to Hewel.

0
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,940
He's the only diplomat
with any influence on him.

0
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,590
Hewel tried everything.
It's useless.

0
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,710
Talk to your sister-in-law then.

0
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:26,440
Why not? You're married
to the sister of Eva Braun.

0
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,600
We must try everything.
Berlin is almost surrounded.

0
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,730
You're still young.
You'll be a father soon.

0
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,850
Do you want to die here?
-Absolutely not.

0
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,140
Gentlemen the Führer.

0
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,640
Everything out. Quickly.
We're leaving in two hours.

0
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,930
What's going on?
-We're leaving.

0
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,570
'Clausewitz' has started.

0
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:17,660
All the ministries and departments
are leaving Berlin.

0
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,380
And who's going to look after
the people and the soldiers?

0
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,060
Don't ask me professor.
-This is insane.

0
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,880
Professor.

0
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,010
I won't allow the
evacuation of my office.

0
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:53,690
Is that so?
-Food supply would collapse.

0
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,820
A good soldier can
always find food.

0
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:02,020
And when there's fighting all over the city
where does he get it? The population.

0
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,030
It's irresponsible.
-It's an order from the Führer.

0
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,720
As department head I
report to the SS and to Himmler.

0
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,400
But as a doctor I'm part of the Wehrmacht
and they're not leaving yet.

0
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,530
Keep that in mind.

0
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:26,860
The professor stays in Berlin.
Get him the proper papers.

0
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,990
We're leaving.

0
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,150
Everything for Germany.
Heil mein Führer.

0
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,320
Führer I...
Heil mein Führer.

0
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,360
They're in such a hurry
to get away from here.

0
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,970
The brown nosing is the worst.

0
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:03,130
They say 'Sieg Heil'. but they think
'Lick my... you know what.'

0
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,900
Mein Führer I beg you: Leave Berlin.
It is not too late yet.

0
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,500
Too late?

0
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,150
Hewel come here for a moment.

0
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:23,470
I'm sure you agree we should contact
the Allies...

0
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:29,190
...and start conducting politics.
-Certainly. We need politics.

0
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:33,360
Politics?
I don't do politics anymore.

0
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,960
I'm fed up with it.

0
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,210
When I'm dead you'll have plenty
of time for politics.

0
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:48,600
It's good dear Himmler.
My loyal Heinrich.

0
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,540
It's good.
Just go.

0
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,450
He has no strength left.

0
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:20,130
What did you expect from a
vegetarian teetotaller?

0
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:24,300
Seriously though Fegelein.
I'm taking control now.

0
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,420
Berlin will fall in a couple of days.

0
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,630
When the Führer's dead who will
the Allies negotiate with?

0
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:35,750
Why do you think they'll
negotiate with you?

0
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,400
The Nazi state and my SS are needed
to maintain order.

0
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,520
One hour with Eisenhower
and he'll feel the same way.

0
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,720
The first contact has been made.
-Careful that's high treason.

0
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,850
Fegelein I have other concerns.

0
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:56,050
Should I give Eisenhower the Nazi salute
or shake his hand?

0
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,220
Look at that.

0
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,920
The best guests
always arrive late.

0
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,650
Leaving already gentlemen?
I wanted to talk to you.

0
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:19,870
The scorched-earth order...
-I really have to go now.

0
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,000
Come and see me one day
in Hohenlychen.

0
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:30,820
I'm going north to help with the
battle of Berlin there.

0
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,440
You know Speer... There's an
advantage to those bombings.

0
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:51,170
It's easier to clean up debris
than to demolish everything ourselves.

0
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,390
When the war will be over
reconstruction will be quick.

0
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:03,690
We spent thousands of hours
together with these replicas.

0
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,390
You're a true genius Speer.

0
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:15,690
Yes absolutely. Only you and I know that
the Third Reich would be inconceivable...

0
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:20,910
...with only warehouses and factories.
Skyscrapers and hotels.

0
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:26,120
This Third Reich will be a treasury
full of art and culture...

0
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,780
...that will survive thousands of years.

0
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:34,260
We see before us the ancient cities
the Acropolis...

0
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,390
We see the medieval cities...
the cathedrals...

0
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:42,090
...and we know that the people
need that.

0
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,820
Indeed Speer.

0
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,520
That was my vision...

0
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,690
...and it still is.

0
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:04,520
Mein Führer if you want to realize
these plans you must leave Berlin.

0
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,860
Eva you say something.

0
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,520
He's the Führer.
He knows what's best.

0
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,730
You must leave Berlin.
The Russians almost have us isolated.

0
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,340
I can't do that my child.

0
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:30,080
I would be like a lama priest
with an empty prayer wheel.

0
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:36,100
I have to solve the problem
here in Berlin or perish.

0
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,710
Speer...

0
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,890
...what do you think?

0
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,580
You have to be on the stage
when the curtain falls.

0
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:06,980
Reload.

0
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,650
Go away. Leave me alone.

0
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:23,820
How old are you? Twelve?
And you? Fourteen?

0
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,470
Why are you here?
To play at war? Go home.

0
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:31,640
Who are you? What do you want?
I want my son. Alive.

0
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,290
You should be proud.
He destroyed two tanks.

0
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,940
The Führer will decorate him
for it today.

0
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,600
You're still young.
At which front did you fight?

0
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,200
I haven't had
the honour yet.

0
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:50,420
Count yourself lucky.
Send the children home.

0
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,550
We'll defend this position
to the last man.

0
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:57,200
Which position?
This is not a position it's a trap.

0
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,380
The Russians will come from two sides
and you won't be able to get out.

0
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,980
We'll shoot back.
-What with?

0
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,590
With the anti-aircraft guns.

0
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,770
The Russians will arrive with several
armies tanks and heavy artillery.

0
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,460
Do you really think you'll
last even five minutes?

0
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,590
We promised the Führer.

0
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,240
Don't you understand?
The war is lost.

0
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,810
Coward.

0
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,590
Go away. Right now.

0
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,330
If you're still here when the Russians
arrive you'll all be dead.

0
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:45,720
The 9th army had to retreat
or they would have been decimated...

0
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:51,460
We won't retreat the 9th army.
Busse must fight where he stands.

0
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,590
Führer then the 9th army is lost.

0
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,330
We'll push back the Soviet armies
in the north and east...

0
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:05,030
...with a ruthless mighty attack.

0
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,110
Using which units?

0
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,850
Steiner will attack from the north
and join the 9th army.

0
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,550
The 9th army is unable to move.

0
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,160
The enemy outnumbers us ten times.

0
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,810
Wenck's 12th army must
support them.

0
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:29,550
The 12th army is approaching the Elbe.
-Then it must turn around.

0
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:34,240
Then the western front would be open.
-Do you doubt my orders?

0
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:38,420
I think I've been
clear enough.

0
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:47,290
The Allies will see that only we
can stop the Bolsheviks.

0
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:52,510
We have to keep Berlin and
make a deal with the Americans.

0
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,940
Mohnke you're here.
-Mein Führer.

0
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:21,200
Today 'Clausewitz' started.
Berlin will be a front city.

0
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,420
You will be the commander of the
defensive circle around the citadel.

0
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,120
We'll fight until the last man in Berlin.

0
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,810
There are still three million civilians here.
They have to be evacuated.

0
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:43,640
I understand your concern Mohnke.
But we have to be cold as ice.

0
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,810
We can't spend any energy
on so-called civilians.

0
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,550
With all due respect what will
happen to the women and children...

0
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,680
...and the thousands of wounded
and elderly?

0
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,850
In a war such as this one
there are no civilians.

0
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,990
The Führer has lost all
sense of reality.

0
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,640
He's moving divisions around
that no longer exist.

0
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,380
Gruppe Steiner has been scattered
yet Steiner must attack. Madness.

0
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,550
But why don't you tell him that?
-He doesn't listen to reason.

0
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:22,250
Something has to happen.
-Are you crazy? He'll throw us out.

0
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:28,510
We're soldiers.
We took an oath.

0
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,110
Does that mean we can't use
our own brains anymore?

0
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,770
And that's coming from you?
A ruthless careerist?

0
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:36,860
I beg your pardon?

0
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,160
Where were you?
-None of your business.

0
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,270
The most successful tank hunters of the
Berlin Hitler-Jugend stand before you.

0
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,670
I'm proud of you.

0
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,490
This boy took out two tanks
using anti-tank shells.

0
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:40,710
His name is Peter Kranz.
-So you're Peter.

0
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,450
I wish my generals were
as brave as you.

0
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,400
Very good.

0
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,030
You've made history.

0
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:11,250
And when Germania will rise
from these ruins...

0
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,860
...you will be the heroes.

0
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,510
Heil to you.

0
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:51,420
I don't know about you
but I prefer air raids.

0
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:57,160
What will happen to us?
-I could go if I wanted to.

0
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,380
But everybody is deserting him.
We can't all go can we?

0
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,460
I can't go either.

0
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,790
I wouldn't know
where to go.

0
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:17,990
My parents and all
my friends warned me.

0
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,120
Don't get involved with the Nazis.

0
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,760
What should I say:
'Hello I made a mistake'?

0
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,360
'When things went wrong
I admitted my mistake.'

0
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:32,050
Life will go on.

0
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:43,620
What do you think Herr Oberst?
-We have to go.

0
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,870
Go where?
-I don't know.

0
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,470
Wherever they need us.

0
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,040
Let's go upstairs.
We'll party.

0
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:08,610
Come on.

0
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,280
Come children.

0
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,180
We should have fun today.

0
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:34,280
Wherever the enemy goes
all they find is destruction.

0
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,930
That's the death sentence
for the German people.

0
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:43,130
No power no gas no drinking
water no coal no traffic.

0
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:50,940
If you destroy everything our country
will go back to the Middle Ages.

0
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,590
This order denies the people
any chance of survival.

0
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:59,790
If the war is lost what does it matter
that the people are lost too?

0
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:06,040
The primary necessities of life of the
German people aren't relevant right now.

0
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,680
On the contrary.
We'd best destroy them ourselves.

0
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,810
Our people turned out weak...

0
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:16,970
...and according to the laws of nature
they should die out.

0
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:20,610
They're your people.
You're their Führer.

0
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,740
What remains after this battle...

0
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:28,940
...is only the inferior.
The superior will have fallen.

0
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:39,590
Come along. You have to dance.

0
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:43,240
Care to dance Fräulein Braun?
-I'd love to.

0
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,980
May I?
-Go ahead.

0
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,060
What's wrong?

0
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,390
We have to leave Berlin Eva.
You must convince him.

0
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,120
Or else come with me.

0
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,610
You'll die.

0
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,950
Can somebody play some music?
I want to dance.

0
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,510
Dance.

0
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,820
Do you have a request?
-As long as it swings.

0
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,790
Traudl.

0
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:48,270
It's all so unreal.

0
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:54,510
It's like a dream you
can't get out of.

0
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,600
It keeps on going.

0
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,380
Gerda I don't feel well.

0
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,570
Traudl come.

0
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,310
I did not move...

0
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,020
I did not move
my command post.

0
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,530
To the west? How so?

0
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:15,190
I'm at 1000 meters from the enemy.
-General.

0
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,950
And general?

0
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:41,090
I'll be executed.
-What? Why?

0
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:46,320
They think I moved my
command post to the west.

0
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:49,980
Be sensible general.
-Come along.

0
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,280
Schenck.
-Mohnke.

0
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:14,450
I'm under the chancellery.
I'm commander of the citadel now.

0
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:19,140
I need help.
-That will be difficult. Everything's gone.

0
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,750
My assistant and I are
the only ones here.

0
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,740
You're a doctor aren't you?
-Yes an internist.

0
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:29,430
Commandeer a car and
bring all the medication...

0
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,550
...you can find to me.

0
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:36,200
I'll do my best.
-Thanks. Hurry.

0
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:28,480
I need to talk to the Führer.

0
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,160
What about?
-I'm going to be executed.

0
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:37,850
Wait here.

0
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,450
Your weapon please.

0
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:48,790
Not here.

0
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,010
Guard post 2.
Understood.

0
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,650
General...

0
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,820
Not you.

0
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,870
What's going on here?
Why am I going to be executed?

0
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,560
You know that any evasive manoeuvre
towards the west is forbidden.

0
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,770
Officers who don't obey
must be executed.

0
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:43,410
What do you mean?
My troops have been fighting for days.

0
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:48,620
My command post
is a kilometre away from the front line.

0
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,710
Continue.

0
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:55,390
Do you see this? I don't want you
to use that tone with me.

0
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,080
And now do whatever
you feel you must.

0
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,770
It's best if you tell this to the
Führer yourself. Come along.

0
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:24,280
You can't pass Oberst.
-Orders from brigade-führer Mohnke:

00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,400
I have to get into the hospital.
We need medication.

0
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,530
There's nobody left.
They all took off.

0
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:33,650
And the wounded?
-How should I know?

0
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,260
I'm going to have a look.
You stay here.

0
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:40,620
Be very careful.
There are lots of Russians here.

0
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:46,130
See that? That's where the
Reich ends. Behind it is Russkie land.

0
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,530
May I?

0
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:10,450
He's damned stubborn.
Why doesn't he let me do that?

0
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,320
I should have been back by now.
Are you sure the Führer still needs me?

0
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:18,970
Drink.
-Führer's orders.

0
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:22,590
You made a big impression
on the Führer.

0
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,200
But you don't think Steiner
will attack do you?

0
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,320
I doubt whether Steiner
is able to do anything...

0
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,450
...but you probably know that
better than I do.

0
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,610
If Steiner doesn't attack
Berlin is lost.

0
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,370
The Führer was impressed
with your report.

0
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:52,060
He puts you in command of
the defence of Berlin.

0
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:57,780
I'd have preferred it
if he executed me.

0
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,790
Let them get closer.

0
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,770
Tank alert.

0
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:28,650
Take it easy. Wait kid.
They're still too far.

0
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:22,050
Is it German artillery that I hear?
-I'm afraid not.

0
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,660
But hasn't Steiner's
attack started?

0
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,910
You have to go as fast as you can.
Time is running out.

0
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,510
But the Führer has
the situation under control.

0
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,110
Steiner will make
all the difference.

0
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,280
He says it will change
military history.

0
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,450
Everybody but the Führer knows
that's a fantasy.

0
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:50,180
I even wonder if he believes it himself.
-Why would he be playing games?

0
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,260
What does he have to lose?

0
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,860
I don't believe a word of it.

0
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:58,510
The enemy made a breakthrough.

0
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:02,680
They took Zossen and are advancing
towards Stahnsdorf.

0
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:06,850
They're at the northern city border
between Frohnau and Pankow.

0
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:12,590
In the east they reached
Lichtenberg Mahlsdorf and Karlshorst.

0
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:16,240
If Steiner attacks
everything will be alright.

0
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,460
Mein Führer...

0
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,590
Steiner...

0
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:28,760
Steiner didn't have enough force.

0
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,890
The attack didn't take place.

0
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:53,930
The following stay here:
Keitel Jodl Krebs and Burgdorf.

0
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:13,780
That was an order.
Steiner's attack was an order.

0
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:18,470
How dare you
ignore my orders?

0
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,170
Is this what it came to?

0
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:29,950
The military everybody lied
to me. Even the SS.

0
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:35,680
The generals are no more than
a bunch of disloyal cowards.

0
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,290
I don't allow that...

0
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:43,510
Cowards traitors and incompetents.
-Führer this is outrageous.

0
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:47,680
The generals are the scum
of the German people.

0
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,810
No sense of honour.

0
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:55,500
You call yourself general because
you spent years at the academy...

0
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:59,150
...where you only learnt
to use knife and fork.

0
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:03,850
For years the military
obstructed me.

0
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:08,540
All you ever did is
thwart me.

0
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:12,430
I should have had...

0
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,650
...all the high officers executed.
Like Stalin did.

0
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,990
I never went to the academy.

0
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:31,770
But I conquered all
of Europe on my own.

0
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,130
Traitors.

0
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:43,340
I've been betrayed and deceived
from the start.

0
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:48,560
Such enormous betrayal
of the German people.

0
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:54,820
But all these traitors will pay.
With their own blood.

0
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:57,870
They will drown
in their own blood.

0
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,040
Calm Gerda.

0
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,250
All my orders have
been ignored.

0
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:18,990
How can I be a leader
under these circumstances?

0
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:22,850
It's over.

0
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:29,920
The war is lost.

0
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:39,590
But if you think this means
I'll leave Berlin...

0
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:44,290
...you're wrong. I'd rather
shoot a bullet through my head.

0
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:51,220
Do what you want.

0
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:15,720
The Führer wasn't serious about
killing himself was he?

0
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,840
Frau Junge Frau Christian.

0
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:27,190
Get changed. In one hour
a plane will take you south.

0
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,770
Everything is lost.

0
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:33,380
Completely lost.

0
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:40,680
You know I'll stay with you.
You can't send me away.

0
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,090
I'm staying too mein Führer.

0
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:20,690
Now what?

0
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:23,300
Time to end this charade.

0
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:28,510
Do you want us to stop fighting?
That's inconceivable.

0
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:34,240
The Führer doesn't want us to capitulate.
No more November 1918. Ever.

0
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,400
But he doesn't want to be in charge
anymore. He said: 'Do what you want'.

0
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,050
Nobody can replace him.
He's the Führer.

0
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:44,650
The Führer's confused.
He'll recover.

0
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:48,300
Great.
And then what?

0
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:54,040
No capitulation. That was
never his intention.

0
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,690
We owe it to him.
-Hollow phrases.

0
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:00,300
We have to act now.
Or it will be too late.

0
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:03,950
You're only looking after yourself.
-Mind your words.

0
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,740
Damn.

0
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,610
We'll never get out of here alive.
It's all over.

0
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,180
We've got to wait.

0
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:29,350
Even the Führer doesn't believe in it
anymore. What will happen to us?

0
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:34,050
Günsche says there's a tunnel
that goes under the Russian lines.

0
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:37,700
Why did you say
you wanted to stay with him?

0
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,870
I don't know.
Honestly.

0
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,090
It stopped.
Let's go for a walk.

0
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:30,480
Traudl.

0
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,560
Look here.

0
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:57,600
I'm lighting another one.

0
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:18,150
Let's go down again.

0
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:52,360
Where do they come from?
-Volkssturm. Drafted this afternoon.

0
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:55,490
They have to get
out of the field of fire.

0
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:03,320
The Volkssturm is under the
direct command of Dr. Goebbels.

0
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:10,140
I want them to go away from there.
This is insane.

0
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:12,750
I'll take the responsibility.

0
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,570
I think this is wrong.
-Great.

0
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,700
Stop. Lights out.

0
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:33,830
Stop. Stay where you are.

0
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:37,480
Stay where you are.
-Alright Germans.

0
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,690
Help. They want to kill us.
-What is all this?

0
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:49,870
A Greifkommando.
-You're kidding.

0
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,900
Stop it.
Let those men go.

0
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:06,560
What's this?
You have no authority here.

0
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:11,770
These men are on the run.
Traitors will be killed.

0
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,950
They're old men. Civilians.
You can't do this.

0
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,410
Who's going to stop me?
You maybe?

0
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,580
Stop it. That's enough.

0
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,090
Dismissed.

0
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,980
This man's a doctor.

0
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:38,880
Can you operate?
-Not really.

0
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:46,140
Don't let the children
take too many toys.

0
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:49,790
And not too much nightwear.
That's no longer needed.

0
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:53,450
Herr Minister...
-Frau Junge my family will arrive soon.

0
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:58,130
Can you look after them for a moment?
Thank you.

0
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:00,220
Brigade-führer what can I do for you?

0
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:03,860
Your Volkssturm is an easy prey
for the Russians.

0
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:06,980
They have neither combat experience
nor good weapons.

0
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:12,710
Their unconditional belief
in the final victory makes up for that.

0
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:17,390
Herr Minister without weapons
these men can't fight.

0
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,480
Their deaths will be pointless.

0
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,600
I don't pity them.

0
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,760
I repeat:
I don't pity them.

0
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:29,890
The people called this
upon themselves.

0
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:34,570
This may come as a surprise to you.
Don't fool yourself.

0
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:38,740
We didn't force the people.
They gave us a mandate.

0
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:42,380
And now they're paying for it.

0
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:02,020
Eva you have to leave the Führer.

0
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,620
Don't be stupid.
This is about life and death.

0
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,220
How can you say that?
Where are you?

0
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:10,870
I decided
not to die in Berlin.

0
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:16,070
Does my sister know where you are?
-Think about it. I'll call you back.

0
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,760
Children your room is to the right.

0
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,400
Wait for me.

0
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,610
Hello Frau Goebbels.
-Good to see you Frau Junge.

0
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,080
Line up children.

0
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,680
Helga come. Line up.

0
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:52,410
Let's make ourselves look good and
then we go say hello to uncle Hitler.

0
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:58,660
Do you remember the song?

0
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:42,410
The best thing to do is to
shoot yourself in the mouth.

0
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:49,700
You won't feel a thing.
You'll be dead right away.

0
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:53,340
I want to be a beautiful corpse.
I'll take poison.

0
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:56,980
If I have to die
at least without any pain.

0
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,070
That's definitely painless.

0
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:04,270
It paralyses the nervous system
and the respiratory system.

0
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:06,350
A matter of seconds.

0
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:11,560
Can I have one too?
-Me too.

0
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:21,450
Himmler provided me well.

0
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:41,350
Thank you.

0
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:47,080
I would have liked to give you
a nicer present.

00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,130
Berlin 23 April 1945.

0
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:07,980
Dear sister. I'm sorry
to write you this.

0
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:13,180
But this is how it is. It could
be over any moment.

0
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:16,830
First of all: Hermann isn't with us.

0
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:20,990
But I'm sure
you'll see him again.

0
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:26,720
He'll get through this
and he'll fight from Bavaria.

0
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:30,880
The Führer lost all hope
of a good outcome.

0
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:36,090
Dear son. I don't know
if you'll receive this letter.

0
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:41,810
Maybe someone will allow me
to send you a last greeting.

0
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:45,980
I stayed with daddy
against his will.

0
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:49,620
Last Sunday the Führer
wanted to help me escape.

0
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,750
But you know your mother.
We have the same blood.

0
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:56,910
I won't even think about it.
Our ideology's going down the drain...

0
00:56:57,430 --> 00:57:02,640
...and with it everything that made life
beautiful and worthwhile.

0
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:07,320
After the Führer and National Socialism
there's nothing left to live for.

0
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,970
That's why I brought
the children too.

0
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:13,570
They're too good for the life
that awaits them.

0
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:18,770
God will have mercy on me
if I bring them redemption myself.

0
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:30,750
I'll wear my bracelet with the green
stone until the very end.

0
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:36,480
After that I want
you to always wear it.

0
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:41,690
Unfortunately my diamond watch
is with the watchmaker.

0
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:46,390
I included the address below.
I hope you're lucky enough to get it.

0
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,000
I want you to get it.

0
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:54,220
You'll also get the bracelet
with the topaz pendant.

0
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:57,350
A birthday present
from the Führer.

0
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:02,570
I owe some money
to the Heise company.

0
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:08,510
There may be more debts but
no more than 1500 Reichsmarks.

0
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:16,340
All correspondence with
the Führer must be burnt.

0
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:24,690
I'm sending you some food and tobacco.
The coffee is also for Lindner and Kathl.

0
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:30,950
The cigarettes are for Mandi the tobacco
for daddy the chocolate for mummy.

0
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:36,390
I can't think of anything else.
That's it for today.

0
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:41,050
Dear sister I wish
you lots of happiness.

0
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:45,140
And remember
you will see Hermann again.

0
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:49,320
The warmest regards
and a kiss from...

0
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,400
...your sister.

0
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:45,210
Inge.

0
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:40,050
Listen Keitel.
I want you to leave this evening.

0
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:44,230
Go to Dönitz and help him
with the organisation.

0
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:47,880
Things have to be
started up again.

0
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:51,530
I don't understand you.

0
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:55,710
We have no more oil fields.
That's catastrophic.

0
01:00:56,210 --> 01:01:01,950
It makes any serious operation
impossible.

0
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:08,760
When everything has been solved
here we must get the oil fields back.

0
01:01:13,450 --> 01:01:16,580
Any questions?
-No mein Führer.

0
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:19,710
Good.
Have a good trip.

0
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:49,490
Mein Führer since you have decided
to stay here in Berlin...

0
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:56,630
...do you agree that I take charge...

0
01:02:57,150 --> 01:03:00,280
...with complete freedom of action?

0
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,890
If I receive no reply
by 2200 hours...

0
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:06,440
...I'll assume you have
been incapacitated.

0
01:03:06,970 --> 01:03:10,620
I will then act on behalf
of the country and the motherland.

0
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:14,270
That's high treason.
And betrayal of you.

0
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,400
Göring's concerns are not
entirely unjustified.

0
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:21,060
If our communication
system fails...

0
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:24,710
...we'll be cut off
from the outside world.

0
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:27,320
We won't be able
to issue orders anymore.

0
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,450
I think Göring wants to
seize the power.

0
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:34,110
I never trusted his clique
on the Obersalzberg.

0
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:36,720
This looks like a coup.

0
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:40,890
The loser the sponger.

0
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:44,020
A parvenu a lazy bastard.

0
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:49,860
How dare he say
I'm incapacitated?

0
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:54,040
Hello.
-How did you get into Berlin?

0
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:57,170
It wasn't easy
but I must speak to the Führer.

0
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:00,300
If I were you
I'd wait a bit.

0
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:03,950
The Luftwaffe.
What did he turn that into?

0
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,610
For that alone
he should be executed.

0
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:13,860
This morphine addict
corrupted the country.

0
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:16,460
And now this.

0
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:20,100
He's betraying me.

0
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:24,790
Me of all people.

0
01:04:24,790 --> 01:04:35,200
I want Göring stripped
of his power right away.

0
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,840
And in case I don't
survive the war...

0
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:42,490
...he must be
executed immediately.

0
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:49,250
What's going to happen to us?
Is there any hope left?

0
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:54,980
Frau Junge leave from
here before it's too late.

0
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:59,660
The Führer wants to stay.
We can't leave him behind can we?

0
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:05,390
He doesn't need anybody for what
awaits him. And least of all you.

0
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:10,600
But Herr Goebbels and his wife
stay here. And the children.

0
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:22,050
But the children...

0
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:27,780
I have always believed...

0
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:32,460
...that there was a way out.

0
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:41,310
Come in.

0
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:45,480
Albert. Hello.

0
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:59,010
You have a fever.

0
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:02,650
Albert I can't stand
it anymore.

0
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:07,340
Why don't you leave with
the children Magda?

0
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:10,460
Leave?
And go where?

0
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:15,670
I can arrange for you to be
taken to Schwanenwerder by barge.

0
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:19,830
You can hide
until everything's over.

0
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:22,440
It won't be long now anyway.

0
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,040
I thought about it.

0
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:31,810
My children cannot grow up
in a world without National Socialism.

0
01:06:34,930 --> 01:06:39,610
Think about it. The children
have a right to a future.

0
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:48,470
If National Socialism dies
there will be no future.

0
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:07,490
I can't believe
you really want that.

0
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:12,170
Go now.

0
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:45,110
Come in.

0
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,360
I knew you'd come.

0
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:55,000
You wouldn't desert
the Führer.

0
01:07:59,030 --> 01:08:04,760
I've come to say goodbye to the Führer.
I'm going back to Hamburg tonight.

0
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,880
Of course you must go.
Sit down.

0
01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:13,610
I took some furniture
you designed.

0
01:08:13,610 --> 01:08:16,160
I couldn't leave it behind.

0
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:20,840
Please you must
not have eaten all day.

0
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:23,450
That's true.

0
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:33,340
It's very important that you came.
It shows him you're on his side.

0
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,940
Did he ever doubt that?

0
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:41,150
Lately he often thought
you were against him too.

0
01:08:41,670 --> 01:08:45,310
I always said you'd come
and here you are.

0
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,640
I think he liked it that you
advised him to stay in Berlin.

0
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:56,240
I also think it's best.

0
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:01,450
And you know...

0
01:09:02,490 --> 01:09:04,570
...it may sound strange...

0
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:11,860
...but I'm really happy here.
And I'm not afraid.

0
01:09:38,610 --> 01:09:43,300
You came.
-Mein Führer I...

0
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:45,380
It's good.

0
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:48,510
Let's sit down.

0
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:11,690
I had great plans
for the Germans and the world.

0
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:18,470
Nobody understood me.
Not even my old brothers in arms.

0
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:28,910
The opportunities we had.
The whole world was ours to grab.

0
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:33,480
Too late.

0
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:44,960
I can only be proud for openly
fighting the Jews...

0
01:10:46,530 --> 01:10:50,700
...and for cleansing the Lebensraum
from the Jewish poison.

0
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:59,580
I don't find it hard to continue.
One brief moment...

0
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:10,020
...and then eternal peace.

0
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:17,320
But please spare the people
mein Führer.

0
01:11:17,330 --> 01:11:23,070
If my people cannot endure
this ordeal...

0
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:26,200
...I won't shed a tear.

0
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,810
They get what they deserve.

0
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:35,070
They called this fate
upon themselves.

0
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:42,380
For months...

0
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:46,040
...I have to tell you this...

0
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:51,260
...for months I have sabotaged
your orders for destruction.

0
01:11:53,350 --> 01:12:00,130
I not only ignored your orders
but even acted against them.

0
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:06,910
I had to tell you.

0
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:20,400
This never compromised
my personal loyalty to you.

0
01:12:33,670 --> 01:12:36,280
So you're leaving.

0
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:39,100
Good.

0
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:41,180
Goodbye.

0
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:54,890
I wish you all the best.

0
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:20,580
Eat well gentlemen.

0
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:17,970
Peter.

0
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,650
It's alright son.

0
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,060
He has a fever.

0
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:51,260
Yes but he's alive.

0
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:20,340
Loyalty and courage
still exist in this world.

0
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:23,990
Ritter von Greim
and Fräulein Reitsch how good...

0
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:31,300
...that the both of you arrived
more or less unharmed.

0
01:15:32,350 --> 01:15:33,390
Sit down.

0
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:38,090
We came under heavy fire but
still arrived in Gatow.

0
01:15:38,610 --> 01:15:41,220
From there
we couldn't continue.

0
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:46,440
We flew in a Fieseler Storch
over the Russian lines...

0
01:15:47,490 --> 01:15:50,100
...and landed on the
East-West axis close to here.

0
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:53,240
Before landing the Soviets
had a go at us.

0
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:59,630
General Von Greim I appoint you
supreme commander of the Luftwaffe.

0
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:03,290
I hereby promote you
to General-Feldmarschall.

0
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:07,020
A big responsibility
rests on your shoulders.

0
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:10,680
You have to rebuild the
Luftwaffe from scratch.

0
01:16:11,210 --> 01:16:13,820
Many mistakes have been made.
Be ruthless.

0
01:16:15,390 --> 01:16:18,530
Life doesn't forgive weakness.

0
01:16:20,630 --> 01:16:26,390
This so-called humanity
is religious drivel.

0
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:33,190
Compassion is an eternal sin.
To feel compassion for the weak...

0
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:35,290
...is a betrayal of nature.

0
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:41,570
The strong can only triumph
if the weak are exterminated.

0
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:45,880
Being loyal to this law
I've never had compassion.

0
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:54,090
I've always been ruthless
when faced with internal...

0
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:58,800
...opposition from other races.
And that's the only way.

0
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:02,990
Apes for instance...

0
01:17:03,990 --> 01:17:08,700
...kill all the odd ones.

0
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:14,980
And what applies to apes
must definitely apply to humans.

0
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,380
Himmler made an offer to surrender...

0
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:29,140
...to the allied powers.

0
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:31,230
Via Count Bernadotte.

0
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:35,940
A message from the English radio.

0
01:17:40,650 --> 01:17:45,890
Himmler.
Himmler of all people.

0
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:54,270
The most loyal of my loyals.
That's the worst betrayal.

0
01:17:57,930 --> 01:17:59,120
Göring he was corrupt.
Always has been.

0
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:08,340
Speer an absent-minded artist.
All the others: yes.

0
01:18:08,860 --> 01:18:15,110
But Himmler?
Has he gone insane?

0
01:18:15,630 --> 01:18:19,790
He must have told
them I'm sick.

0
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,400
Maybe even dead.

0
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:33,330
Leave me alone with Ritter Von Greim
and Fräulein Reitsch.

0
01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:39,580
And get Fegelein.
-We don't know where he is.

0
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:43,740
What? He's Himmler's assistant.
He must be available.

0
01:18:43,740 --> 01:18:48,430
We haven't seen him for days.
-I want a report immediately.

0
01:18:51,550 --> 01:18:53,110
Please stay here Doctor.

0
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:02,480
You and Greim must go as quickly
as possible. Fly to Dönitz.

0
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:08,730
Tell him to do anything
it takes to punish Himmler.

0
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:13,410
We've decided to
die with you.

0
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:18,620
Thank you for this proof of loyalty.

0
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:23,820
But Himmler must die.
He committed treason.

0
01:19:23,830 --> 01:19:28,510
He's no longer privvy
to my plans.

0
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:30,070
Mein Führer?

0
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:34,240
Do you think I'll sit and wait until
those Jewish swine slaughter me?

0
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:38,920
This is part of a huge decoy operation.
I've allowed the enemy...

0
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:44,130
...to invade the Reich and they
think they've won.

0
01:19:44,650 --> 01:19:48,290
But mark my words: they have
another thing coming.

0
01:19:48,290 --> 01:19:52,460
Dönitz is mobilising in the north.
Kesselring in the south.

0
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:57,140
We'll surround the enemy
and crush them.

0
01:19:57,660 --> 01:20:02,870
From Prague three armies will attack
the Russians simultaneously from the back.

0
01:20:03,390 --> 01:20:08,590
I didn't know we still had
so many reserve troops.

0
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:13,280
I made sure you'll soon have
a 1000 of the most modern...

0
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:17,440
...jets at your disposal.

0
01:20:17,970 --> 01:20:22,130
With those you can make the
Luftwaffe ready for battle again.

0
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:27,340
I kneel to your genius at the
altar of the motherland.

0
01:20:42,220 --> 01:20:43,780
Heil mein Führer.

0
01:20:46,910 --> 01:20:50,030
You also request to leave Berlin?

0
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:55,760
Mein Führer as you know
all medical departments...

0
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:59,400
...that fall under the SS and Himmler
have left Berlin.

0
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:04,610
Himmler is a traitor.
He won't escape punishment.

0
01:21:05,130 --> 01:21:09,970
Mein Führer as Reichsarzt SS
I have no more work here.

0
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:14,650
Your request to leave Berlin
is unacceptable.

0
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:18,300
My family...

0
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:22,980
If the Russians...
I must leave.

0
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,060
You did nothing wrong.

0
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:31,310
Future generations will thank you
for you medical research.

0
01:21:31,830 --> 01:21:33,910
I take all the responsibility.

0
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:42,760
We'll talk about it later.

0
01:21:57,100 --> 01:22:01,270
GruppenFührer Fegelein cannot
be found. He's not in the bunker.

0
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:04,390
What you can't find Fegelein?

0
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:09,600
Keep searching.
I need to talk to him. Immediately.

0
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:14,800
If he left just like that
that's desertion. Treason.

0
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:16,880
Bring me Fegelein.

0
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:20,010
Fegelein. Fegelein.

0
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:34,620
Daddy why are you wearing
your Sunday uniform?

0
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:42,430
Ernst is something wrong?
-No.

0
01:22:42,950 --> 01:22:44,510
Thank you.

0
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,600
Brigitte is hungry too.

0
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:52,320
Ilse you should
eat something as well.

0
01:22:54,410 --> 01:22:56,490
Thank you.
-There you go.

0
01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:02,730
Thank you.

0
01:23:56,750 --> 01:24:00,390
What is it?
-GruppenFührer you're under arrest.

0
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:03,000
What?
-You're suspected of desertion.

0
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:05,600
Get dressed.
You'll come with us.

0
01:24:10,810 --> 01:24:12,370
Search the room.

0
01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:16,010
Let go of me.
You can't give me orders.

0
01:24:18,090 --> 01:24:21,220
You can't have Hermann
executed can you?

0
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:24,860
There's no doubt.
He wanted to flee.

0
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:28,500
What does it matter?
Everything's over.

0
01:24:29,550 --> 01:24:32,150
Think of my poor sister.
She's pregnant by Hermann.

0
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:35,790
He collaborated with Himmler.
He's a traitor.

0
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:44,120
There's no mercy for traitors.
No compassion for them.

0
01:24:46,210 --> 01:24:49,330
He'll be court-martialled
and executed.

0
01:24:50,370 --> 01:24:52,450
What's the point of that?

0
01:24:54,530 --> 01:24:56,100
It is my wish.

0
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:11,030
You're the Führer.

0
01:25:14,870 --> 01:25:15,910
Speak.

0
01:25:16,430 --> 01:25:19,030
The Russians are advancing
more and more.

0
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:22,680
There are no more reserves.
Supplies from the air are impossible.

0
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,800
There is no ammunition coming
in anymore.

0
01:25:29,970 --> 01:25:32,570
In the north the Russians are standing
in front of the Weidendammer bridge.

0
01:25:33,090 --> 01:25:36,210
In the east: Lustgarten.
South: Potsdammer Platz.

0
01:25:36,730 --> 01:25:40,380
West: Tiergarten about 400 metres
away from the chancellery.

0
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:44,540
How long can you hold out?
-At most two days.

0
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:48,190
Including the government area?
-Yes.

0
01:25:49,230 --> 01:25:54,430
As a soldier I suggest we
flee Berlin. It's surrounded.

0
01:25:54,960 --> 01:26:01,220
The battle of Berlin killed about
20000 of our best officers.

0
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:04,870
That's what young people are for.

0
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:09,050
What you suggest is insane.
Ridiculous.

0
01:26:09,570 --> 01:26:12,700
Think of the thousands of wounded.
We can't help them.

0
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:17,400
Mein Führer the orders have been written.
I give you my word...

0
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:22,620
The Führer cannot make a honourless
disappearance from world history.

0
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:27,320
Even if an advance is successful...

0
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,970
...I'll end up in another
troublesome situation.

0
01:26:31,490 --> 01:26:36,710
I'd have to stay in the open air
or on a farm...

0
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:38,800
...and wait for the end.

0
01:26:40,370 --> 01:26:46,110
Wenck is advancing with the 12th army.
He can join the 9th...

0
01:26:46,450 --> 01:26:50,630
...and give the Russians
the final blow.

0
01:26:51,330 --> 01:26:55,510
Wenck's an excellent fellow.
Send a telegram to Keitel:

0
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:04,380
Immediately report to me the following:
1. Where are Wenck's vanguard located?

0
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:08,030
2. When will they attack again?

0
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:14,820
3. Where is the 9th army?
4. Where will the 9th make a breakthrough?

0
01:27:16,910 --> 01:27:21,600
You'll see gentlemen.
I'll be right.

0
01:27:22,130 --> 01:27:24,740
Wenck will come.

0
01:27:31,230 --> 01:27:33,310
Wenck will come.

0
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:50,740
I want to know if Wenck
can do anything at all.

0
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:55,960
It's unlikely that Wenck's
small amount of troops...

0
01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:01,180
What's unlikely about the offensive?
-Wenck can't do anything anymore.

0
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:05,880
Then why don't you tell the Führer that?
Has everybody gone mad?

0
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:09,530
Do you think the Führer doesn't know?
He'll never surrender.

0
01:28:10,050 --> 01:28:13,710
And neither will we. I've been
through that once. Never again.

0
01:28:14,230 --> 01:28:16,320
Come along. I have to go.

0
01:28:26,470 --> 01:28:28,040
Stop right there.

0
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:41,680
Heil Hitler.

0
01:29:30,470 --> 01:29:33,080
Excuse me. I fell asleep.

0
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,690
Did you get some rest my child?

0
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:41,260
In shorthand.

0
01:29:47,530 --> 01:29:51,180
My political will.

0
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:57,450
More than 30 years have passed...

0
01:29:57,460 --> 01:30:02,150
...since I made my contribution
as a volunteer...

0
01:30:02,150 --> 01:30:06,330
...during the first World War.

0
01:30:06,850 --> 01:30:12,070
During those 30 years
I learnt to think act and live...

0
01:30:12,590 --> 01:30:15,720
...out of love and loyalty
for my people.

0
01:30:19,660 --> 01:30:23,300
Excuse me. The shooting.
-Please sit down.

0
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:29,630
Centuries will pass...

0
01:30:30,150 --> 01:30:34,310
...but from the ruins
of our cities and monuments...

0
01:30:34,310 --> 01:30:40,040
...the hatred
of the people...

0
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:43,160
...who did this to us
will continue to flare up.

0
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:47,850
International Judaism and
its allies.

0
01:30:59,030 --> 01:31:01,110
What is it Herr Minister?

0
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:07,360
Imagine this.
The Führer wants me to leave Berlin.

0
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,480
He ordered it.

0
01:31:12,570 --> 01:31:16,210
I've never ignored an order
from the Führer.

0
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:30,620
But I will ignore this order.
I'll stay with the Führer.

0
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:36,420
Please Frau Junge...

0
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:41,630
...I want to dictate my will to you.

0
01:31:43,710 --> 01:31:46,830
I'm typing
the Führer's will.

0
01:31:47,870 --> 01:31:49,950
Good.

0
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,600
I understand.
Some other time.

0
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:06,000
Mein Führer according to the racial law
I'm obliged to ask you:

0
01:32:06,530 --> 01:32:09,130
Mein Führer are you
of Aryan descent?

0
01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:16,670
Can I see your identity card?

0
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:20,880
You're talking to the Führer here.
-Alright then.

0
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:25,040
And you Fräulein Braun
are you of Aryan descent?

0
01:32:25,870 --> 01:32:29,000
Then there's nothing
to stop us.

0
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:33,160
I'm asking you now:
Do you mein Führer Adolf Hitler...

0
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:38,890
...take Eva Braun present here
as your wife? Answer 'yes'.

0
01:32:40,970 --> 01:32:44,610
Do you Eva Braun take Führer
Adolf Hitler present here...

0
01:32:45,130 --> 01:32:48,260
...as your husband?
Answer 'yes'.

0
01:32:49,820 --> 01:32:52,940
Then I declare you
man and wife.

0
01:33:32,250 --> 01:33:34,330
Two men here.

0
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,160
Everything will be alright.

0
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:42,680
You must go to the Führer right away.
-Now?

0
01:34:02,350 --> 01:34:06,520
How long can we hold out?
-Twenty hours no more.

0
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:13,810
The Russians are close. At the moment
we forced them to stop.

0
01:34:14,330 --> 01:34:19,530
You know Mohnke. The western
democracies are decadent.

0
01:34:20,050 --> 01:34:25,260
They'll succumb to
the people from the east.

0
01:34:28,380 --> 01:34:30,980
All the best. Thank you.

0
01:34:32,030 --> 01:34:35,150
It wasn't just for Germany.

0
01:34:55,050 --> 01:34:57,130
A message from Keitel.

0
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:03,570
1. Wenck's vanguard are
stuck south of Schwielowsee.

0
01:35:04,090 --> 01:35:07,730
2. The 12th army can't continue
the attack on Berlin.

0
01:35:08,770 --> 01:35:12,420
3. The 9th army is
completely surrounded.

0
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:37,570
What do we do when the last
ammunition reserves have been exhausted?

0
01:35:38,610 --> 01:35:41,730
I'll never surrender. Never.

0
01:35:43,810 --> 01:35:49,030
I forbid you and the other
commanders to surrender.

0
01:36:01,030 --> 01:36:06,770
Listen Günsche. My wife and I
are going to commit suicide.

0
01:36:07,290 --> 01:36:11,460
I don't want my corpse
exposed by the Russians.

0
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:15,110
I don't want them to get me
dead or alive.

0
01:36:15,630 --> 01:36:19,280
I want to be burnt
and never to be found.

0
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:26,570
Günsche I want you to promise me...

0
01:36:27,090 --> 01:36:32,300
...that you will do
all that it takes.

0
01:36:32,830 --> 01:36:34,910
Mein Führer...

0
01:36:34,910 --> 01:36:39,080
...this is a terrible order
but I will execute it.

0
01:37:06,350 --> 01:37:09,480
Kempka.
-Erich I need 200 litres of petrol.

0
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:13,120
Are you mad?
Where should I find them?

0
01:37:13,650 --> 01:37:15,730
From the parked vehicles.

0
01:37:16,770 --> 01:37:19,380
What's all that petrol for?
-I can't say.

0
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:39,190
Come please.
The Führer wants to see us.

0
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:51,250
Should I tell the Führer
you're indisposed?

0
01:37:52,290 --> 01:37:55,420
It's only my collapsed lung.

0
01:37:57,460 --> 01:37:59,540
I'll die soon anyway.

0
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:47,120
Excuse me.

0
01:38:59,690 --> 01:39:01,780
Over here Herr Professor.

0
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:13,380
One moment please.

0
01:39:22,620 --> 01:39:24,180
Excuse me.

0
01:39:57,610 --> 01:40:01,780
I'm sorry to interrupt
your important work.

0
01:40:02,300 --> 01:40:06,470
Mein Führer keep faith
in the final victory.

0
01:40:06,990 --> 01:40:11,680
Lead us
and we shall follow.

0
01:40:15,470 --> 01:40:17,040
Come along.

0
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:26,390
Join the gang.

0
01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:31,230
Come. Have a drink.

0
01:40:32,270 --> 01:40:35,920
Besides drinking there's little we can do.
-Do sit down.

0
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:43,220
That's better.
Yes the situation is pretty shitty.

0
01:40:47,390 --> 01:40:51,030
Can we sit down?
-Please do Fräulein...

0
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:55,730
Frau...
-That's Frau Hitler.

0
01:40:58,330 --> 01:40:59,890
It's alright.

0
01:41:01,980 --> 01:41:04,580
A pity we can't go
outside anymore.

0
01:41:05,110 --> 01:41:08,230
Only if you want
to die a heroic death.

0
01:41:08,750 --> 01:41:14,490
Fritz control yourself a bit.
-Yes. Control.

0
01:41:15,530 --> 01:41:17,090
Take cover.

0
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:42,210
What are you doing here?
-I have to report to the Führer.

0
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:44,820
You can't right now.
Sit down.

0
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:47,420
Sit. Drink.

0
01:41:51,590 --> 01:41:53,680
Let me introduce Frau Hitler.

0
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:57,850
So young and so many decorations.
You must be proud.

0
01:42:00,970 --> 01:42:03,580
Excuse me.
I'm not used to drinking anymore.

0
01:42:04,620 --> 01:42:07,230
You can use our toilet.

0
01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:20,230
If your hand shakes the bullet
might only hit an optic nerve.

0
01:42:20,750 --> 01:42:25,440
That's why it's good
to also take the poison.

0
01:42:25,970 --> 01:42:30,660
When you bite through the capsule
pull the trigger.

0
01:42:31,180 --> 01:42:33,260
Will I have enough time?

0
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:36,910
The poison starts working
after one or two seconds.

0
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:56,930
Tornow you too.

0
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:07,530
Come Blondi.

0
01:43:39,190 --> 01:43:41,790
You know Frau Junge
I've known...

0
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:45,440
my husband for
more than 15 years.

0
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:50,650
But when I think about it
I know nothing about him.

0
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:53,260
Even though he likes to talk.

0
01:43:56,390 --> 01:44:01,080
I longed for Berlin
but he's so different now.

0
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:05,250
He only talks about dogs
and vegetarian food now.

0
01:44:05,770 --> 01:44:08,370
I hate Blondi.

0
01:44:09,940 --> 01:44:15,150
I sometimes kick her and Adolf
then wonders why she acts strange.

0
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:28,700
I think he doesn't want anybody
to really know him.

0
01:44:31,830 --> 01:44:36,520
...he can be so caring
in his private life.

0
01:44:38,090 --> 01:44:42,780
And then he uses
that rude language again.

0
01:44:43,830 --> 01:44:45,910
When he's the Führer you mean?

0
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:50,610
Come let's smoke another one.

0
01:45:12,410 --> 01:45:13,970
I'm sorry.

0
01:45:16,050 --> 01:45:20,220
You have so many worries
and here I am whining.

0
01:45:21,260 --> 01:45:24,910
Frau Junge I'm giving you this coat
as a goodbye present.

0
01:45:25,950 --> 01:45:30,650
I like fashionable ladies.
I want you to enjoy it.

0
01:45:31,690 --> 01:45:34,300
What a surprise. Thank you.

0
01:45:35,860 --> 01:45:39,510
I just don't know where and when
I can wear it.

0
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:44,210
Please try to get out of here.

0
01:45:45,770 --> 01:45:47,340
Promise me.

0
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:21,610
Thank you. That was very good
Fräulein Manziarly.

0
01:47:42,620 --> 01:47:46,790
The time has come. It's finished.

0
01:48:25,630 --> 01:48:27,710
The Führer wants to say goodbye.
Come with me.

0
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:02,830
You're the bravest mother
of the Reich.

0
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:07,530
Führer you made me the happiest
woman in Germany.

0
01:49:31,670 --> 01:49:33,760
Salute my beautiful Bavaria.

0
01:49:57,380 --> 01:49:59,460
Children what are you doing here?

0
01:49:59,990 --> 01:50:02,590
We want to see aunt Eva
and uncle Hitler.

0
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:06,770
Have you eaten anything yet?
-Only breakfast.

0
01:50:08,330 --> 01:50:11,980
Stay here I'll get something to eat.
I'll be right back.

0
01:50:21,180 --> 01:50:25,870
Comrades this is the
latest news from the outside.

0
01:50:26,390 --> 01:50:31,610
Berlin is full of warehouses: There were
houses here there were houses there.

0
01:50:37,140 --> 01:50:39,220
Herr Günsche
I want to speak to the Führer.

0
01:50:41,310 --> 01:50:42,870
Please I have to.

0
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:46,000
Frau Goebbels the Führer
doesn't want to be disturbed.

0
01:50:46,010 --> 01:50:49,130
Please Günsche
just for a moment.

0
01:50:49,660 --> 01:50:51,220
Please.

0
01:50:58,690 --> 01:51:01,300
Mein Führer Frau Goebbels is here.

0
01:51:07,780 --> 01:51:09,340
What is it?

0
01:51:09,860 --> 01:51:13,510
Mein Führer I beg you:
Leave Berlin.

0
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:20,300
Don't leave us Führer.
What will become of us?

0
01:51:24,180 --> 01:51:31,480
Tomorrow I'll be cursed by millions
but that's how it is.

0
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:36,370
Get up. Come.

0
01:51:38,980 --> 01:51:41,070
Come.

0
01:51:49,410 --> 01:51:52,010
Aunt Traudl I like it
when it thunders.

0
01:51:52,540 --> 01:51:56,190
Why?
-Nothing can happen to us here.

0
01:51:56,710 --> 01:51:58,800
Can it?
-No.

0
01:52:08,310 --> 01:52:09,870
Gotcha.

0
01:52:32,900 --> 01:52:36,550
Reichsleiter it's over.

0
01:52:55,430 --> 01:52:58,040
The Führer is dead.

0
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:15,890
There's daddy.

0
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:31,010
Are you crazy?
For that damned petrol of yours...

0
01:53:31,530 --> 01:53:33,620
Erich shut up.

0
01:53:44,070 --> 01:53:45,640
Stand back.

0
01:53:59,100 --> 01:54:00,670
Come on continue.

0
01:54:01,190 --> 01:54:02,750
Continue.

0
01:55:32,280 --> 01:55:35,410
No don't.

0
01:55:36,690 --> 01:55:38,780
Let grandpa go.

0
01:55:45,130 --> 01:55:48,780
Order. Order.
We must have order.

0
01:55:49,830 --> 01:55:52,430
Order has to return.

0
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:10,940
This way. We know the way.
You can trust us.

0
01:56:11,980 --> 01:56:13,550
Hurry.

0
01:56:20,060 --> 01:56:22,670
I was on the side of
the Red Beasts.

0
01:56:26,710 --> 01:56:28,790
I supported the Bolsheviks.

0
01:56:36,290 --> 01:56:37,850
Let's hope the Russians
got our message.

0
01:56:38,380 --> 01:56:40,980
We'll soon find out.
-Or not.

0
01:56:46,210 --> 01:56:49,340
What news do you have General?

0
01:56:49,860 --> 01:56:55,070
Adolf Hitler and his wife
committed suicide in the bunker.

0
01:56:58,210 --> 01:57:02,380
The new government
authorised me...

0
01:57:04,470 --> 01:57:07,600
...to start peace talks...

0
01:57:08,120 --> 01:57:14,380
...between our countries that both
suffered severe losses.

0
01:57:15,420 --> 01:57:20,120
General if you were me
would you make peace with you?

0
01:57:20,640 --> 01:57:24,810
My government will never accept
unconditional surrender.

0
01:57:27,420 --> 01:57:31,590
Given the situation
you have no other choice.

0
01:57:34,720 --> 01:57:37,330
Surrender? Never.
That's shameful.

0
01:57:38,380 --> 01:57:40,460
Years ago I conquered
Berlin on the Reds...

0
01:57:40,980 --> 01:57:45,140
...and I'll defend the city
to my dying day.

0
01:57:46,180 --> 01:57:48,790
In the short time I have
as Chancellor...

0
01:57:49,310 --> 01:57:53,470
...I'll never sign
a surrender treaty.

0
01:57:53,990 --> 01:57:57,120
It's for the sake of the people.
-The Führer's orders are final.

0
01:57:57,640 --> 01:58:01,280
This is crazy.
We have to start negotiations.

0
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:04,920
I repeat gentlemen:
I do not surrender.

0
01:58:05,970 --> 01:58:08,570
Send a message to Marshal Zhukov.
-Zhukov?

0
01:58:09,090 --> 01:58:11,690
What's happening?
-We're surrendering.

0
01:58:12,210 --> 01:58:15,340
Then I must kill you.
The Führer forbids any surrender.

0
01:58:35,420 --> 01:58:38,540
How long does it work?
-Around four hours.

0
01:59:15,650 --> 01:59:20,850
Children the doctor has the medication
I told you about.

0
01:59:21,370 --> 01:59:23,980
It's a bit bitter
but it will work.

0
01:59:25,540 --> 01:59:27,100
A sip for everybody.

0
01:59:28,660 --> 01:59:30,740
Who wants to go first?

0
01:59:33,350 --> 01:59:36,990
Heide you're always so brave?

0
01:59:42,720 --> 01:59:44,280
Have another sip.

0
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:49,480
See? That wasn't so bad.

0
01:59:54,630 --> 01:59:56,710
Well done.
Helmut.

0
01:59:59,830 --> 02:00:04,520
This medication makes sure you don't
get ill in this humid bunker.

0
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:07,640
But it's not humid
in the bunker.

0
02:00:12,330 --> 02:00:13,890
Well done.

0
02:00:23,140 --> 02:00:24,700
Helga.

0
02:00:27,430 --> 02:00:28,470
I don't want to.

0
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:33,630
What's that? Do you want to get sick?
-Please mama. I don't want to drink it.

0
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:41,450
Don't cry baby.
That doesn't help.

0
02:00:41,970 --> 02:00:44,060
You have to drink the medicine.

0
02:00:47,710 --> 02:00:49,280
Helga.

0
02:00:55,010 --> 02:00:57,620
Come on open your mouth.

0
02:01:18,950 --> 02:01:20,520
Goodnight children.

0
02:01:31,290 --> 02:01:34,420
One day the lie will fall apart...

0
02:01:34,420 --> 02:01:37,550
...and there will be light
in the darkness.

0
02:01:38,590 --> 02:01:40,150
Please read that.

0
02:01:41,200 --> 02:01:45,890
One day the lie will fall apart
and there will be light in the darkness.

0
02:01:47,460 --> 02:01:50,590
Let's do it differently.
One day the lie will collapse...

0
02:01:51,110 --> 02:01:55,800
...and truth will triumph
once again.

0
02:01:56,320 --> 02:01:59,980
At that moment we will
stand above everybody...

0
02:02:00,500 --> 02:02:02,580
...pure and...

0
02:02:05,710 --> 02:02:07,800
immaculate.

0
02:06:14,850 --> 02:06:17,980
We don't stand a chance.
-So what? I want to get away.

0
02:06:18,500 --> 02:06:20,070
How do we get
through the lines?

0
02:06:20,590 --> 02:06:23,200
Doesn't matter.
I'm not staying another minute.

0
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:26,850
We'll die.
-It won't be that bad surely.

0
02:06:27,890 --> 02:06:30,500
If we stay the Russians
will get us for sure.

0
02:06:32,580 --> 02:06:33,630
All the best.

0
02:06:34,150 --> 02:06:36,240
Come let's go.

0
02:08:05,100 --> 02:08:11,840
On 30 April 1945 the Führer
committed suicide...

0
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:17,570
...and in doing so he deserted
everybody who was loyal to him.

0
02:08:18,100 --> 02:08:23,310
You German soldiers were loyal to
the Führer and were prepared...

0
02:08:23,830 --> 02:08:30,090
...to continue the battle for Berlin
although ammunition was in short supply...

0
02:08:30,610 --> 02:08:35,310
...and further resistance
was pointless.

0
02:08:35,830 --> 02:08:39,480
I hereby declare an
immediate cease-fire.

0
02:08:41,050 --> 02:08:43,650
Each hour you continue fighting...

0
02:08:44,180 --> 02:08:50,960
...prolongs the suffering of the people
of Berlin and of our wounded.

0
02:08:51,480 --> 02:08:55,130
In agreement with the supreme
command of the Soviet troops...

0
02:08:55,650 --> 02:09:01,390
...I order you to stop
fighting immediately.

0
02:09:01,910 --> 02:09:09,210
Weidling former commander
of the Berlin defence area.

0
02:09:10,780 --> 02:09:12,860
A glass of water please.

0
02:10:18,600 --> 02:10:21,210
I don't need you anymore.

0
02:10:24,340 --> 02:10:26,950
The game's over.

0
02:11:34,660 --> 02:11:37,270
It's time.
-Don't you see what's going on here?

0
02:11:37,790 --> 02:11:40,910
I insist that you help us
as a doctor.

0
02:11:41,960 --> 02:11:44,040
Alright then.

0
02:11:51,330 --> 02:11:56,020
Go. You did a lot.
Thank you.

0
02:12:02,770 --> 02:12:08,860
Schädle hurry. Come on.
-I'm not going anywhere anymore.

0
02:12:11,460 --> 02:12:13,030
Come along.

0
02:12:51,630 --> 02:12:54,230
Are you alright?
-Keep going.

0
02:13:31,030 --> 02:13:34,680
Sturmmann Krüger and his group
defended the Wolf Bridge...

0
02:13:35,200 --> 02:13:37,800
...and he receives the Iron Cross.

0
02:13:38,320 --> 02:13:42,490
Sturmmann Wagner took out two
machine-gun nests...

0
02:13:43,010 --> 02:13:46,140
...and therefore receives
the Iron Cross.

0
02:13:46,660 --> 02:13:50,310
Sturmmann Rauch has gotten
messages through the lines...

0
02:13:50,830 --> 02:13:53,430
...and receives the Iron Cross.

0
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:26,680
The others are coming.

0
02:14:33,320 --> 02:14:35,400
Take cover Müller.

0
02:14:55,030 --> 02:14:56,070
Who's that?

0
02:15:03,730 --> 02:15:05,810
A German.

0
02:15:11,430 --> 02:15:12,990
Herr Hewel?

0
02:15:16,640 --> 02:15:18,720
Thank God you're alive.

0
02:15:20,810 --> 02:15:22,370
Where are the others?

0
02:15:24,980 --> 02:15:29,140
I don't know Frau Junge.
Somewhere. Maybe.

0
02:15:29,670 --> 02:15:32,790
Most people from my group
must be dead.

0
02:15:33,310 --> 02:15:35,920
I should never
have left that bunker.

0
02:15:36,440 --> 02:15:41,130
I should have shot myself
but I couldn't.

0
02:15:43,210 --> 02:15:46,340
Eat something first.
There's always enough time to die.

0
02:16:43,650 --> 02:16:46,260
You stay with the women.

0
02:16:47,390 --> 02:16:48,950
Come along.

0
02:17:01,480 --> 02:17:05,130
The Russians have surrounded us.
-What's going to happen to us?

0
02:17:05,650 --> 02:17:08,250
Maybe you can get through.
You could try.

0
02:17:08,770 --> 02:17:10,340
I'm not taking another step.

0
02:17:11,380 --> 02:17:16,070
Think about it. The Russians
are after us.

0
02:17:16,590 --> 02:17:21,800
As a woman you might have a chance.
Try it.

0
02:17:22,840 --> 02:17:24,400
Good luck.

0
02:17:27,010 --> 02:17:31,180
When you walk past the Russians
don't look them in the eyes.

0
02:17:31,700 --> 02:17:35,350
Remember that well. All the best.

0
02:17:44,370 --> 02:17:45,930
The Russians.

0
02:17:58,510 --> 02:18:01,120
Gerda let's go.
-You go.

0
02:18:01,640 --> 02:18:04,770
I'm exhausted.
-Please.

0
02:18:06,860 --> 02:18:11,030
I have to give it a try.
Don't be angry with me.

0
02:18:15,210 --> 02:18:16,770
I'll be alright.

0
02:18:29,900 --> 02:18:31,470
Herr Doktor.

0
02:18:31,990 --> 02:18:36,690
My comrades want to surrender.
Can I join you?

0
02:18:37,210 --> 02:18:40,860
The Führer's dead. Do you want
to continue the war on your own?

0
02:18:41,380 --> 02:18:42,950
I'm obliged by my oath.

0
02:18:43,470 --> 02:18:48,170
Then you'd better go
to the brigade-führer.

0
02:19:16,840 --> 02:19:18,400
The Russians are evacuating the square.
-So?

0
02:19:19,450 --> 02:19:21,540
No opposition.
No shooting.

0
02:19:22,060 --> 02:19:24,670
Then they'll be
here within the hour.

0
02:19:25,190 --> 02:19:27,280
What shall we do?

0
02:19:27,280 --> 02:19:31,970
We can't surrender.
-What exactly do you mean?

0
02:19:32,500 --> 02:19:36,150
When the Russians come
we'll empty our weapons on them.

0
02:19:36,670 --> 02:19:40,320
The last bullets are for ourselves.
-That's radical.

0
02:19:40,320 --> 02:19:45,540
Is this prestigious murder and suicide
our only option?

0
02:19:46,070 --> 02:19:49,720
We're SS officers.
We can't survive the Führer.

0
02:19:49,720 --> 02:19:52,850
Who agrees with me?

0
02:21:40,520 --> 02:21:43,650
Come and sit down with me?
-Please.

0
02:21:49,480 --> 02:21:54,700
Why do you want to continue living?
-And you? Why do you want to die?

0
02:21:56,270 --> 02:21:58,390
See this?

0
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:02,110
The Führer gave it
to me personally.

0
02:22:02,640 --> 02:22:06,360
As a last decoration?
-Maybe.

0
02:22:06,900 --> 02:22:11,680
A goodbye present from Hitler.
I had to promise him something.

0
02:22:11,680 --> 02:22:16,990
If the Russians get me
I have to kill myself.

0
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:23,370
Did he make you promise that?
But why?

0
02:22:23,900 --> 02:22:27,090
Maybe he didn't want
me to be forced...

0
02:22:27,620 --> 02:22:29,750
...to say anything bad
about him.

0
02:22:30,280 --> 02:22:34,530
But as a diplomat
you're under international protection.

0
02:22:35,060 --> 02:22:38,780
Who will benefit
if you stick to your deal?

0
02:22:39,310 --> 02:22:40,910
There they are.

0
02:22:54,320 --> 02:22:55,910
Don't shoot comrades.

0
02:22:59,910 --> 02:23:04,700
We surrendered.
The war is over.

0
02:23:05,760 --> 02:23:07,880
It's over.

0
02:24:43,430 --> 02:24:46,610
Complete surrender took place
on 7 May 1945.

0
02:24:48,740 --> 02:24:51,930
Hostilities were suspended
on 8 May.

0
02:24:54,060 --> 02:24:57,780

than 50 million people.

0
02:24:59,370 --> 02:25:04,680

in German concentration camps.

0

0
02:25:11,060 --> 02:25:14,250

on 14 April 1997.

0
02:25:14,780 --> 02:25:19,030

and would break many flying records.

Heinrich Himmler tried to escape
using a false name.

Martin Bormann and Ludwig
Stumpfegger committed suicide...

0

near the Lehrter Bahnhof.

by the Soviets in 1955.

He still lives in Berlin.

0
02:27:20,200 --> 02:27:22,860
Traudl Junge was classified
as a 'young follower'.

0
02:27:23,390 --> 02:27:26,580
She worked as a secretary and lived
in Munich until her death in 2002.

0
02:27:27,110 --> 02:27:32,430
All the horror I heard about during
the Nuremberg trial...

0
02:27:32,430 --> 02:27:39,340
...the 6 million Jews dissidents
or people of another race...

0
02:27:39,870 --> 02:27:45,710
...who died shocked me deeply.

0
02:27:46,780 --> 02:27:51,560
But I hadn't made the connection
with my own past yet.

0
02:27:52,620 --> 02:27:57,410
I reassured myself by thinking
I wasn't personally guilty of it.

0
02:27:57,940 --> 02:28:03,250
And that I hadn't known
about the sheer size of it.

0
02:28:03,780 --> 02:28:10,160
But one day I walked
past a commemorative plaque...

0
02:28:10,690 --> 02:28:14,410
...for Sophie Scholl
here in the Franz-Joseph-Strasse.

0
02:28:15,480 --> 02:28:18,130
I saw that she was my age...

0
02:28:18,660 --> 02:28:24,510
...and that she was executed in
the year I joined Hitler.

0
02:28:25,040 --> 02:28:30,360
And only then did I realise...

0
02:28:31,420 --> 02:28:34,080
that youth is no excuse.

0
02:28:34,610 --> 02:28:40,990
And that it might have been
possible to find out the truth.

0
02:31:20,050 --> 02:31:23,240
DOWNFALL
