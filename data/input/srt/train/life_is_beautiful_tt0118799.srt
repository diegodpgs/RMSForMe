1
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,720
This is a simple story...

2
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,370
but not an easy one, to tell.

3
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,370
Like a fable, there is sorrow...

4
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,120
and, like a fable, it is full
of wonder and happiness.

5
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,930
I sing what I see. Nothing gets by me.

6
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,690
"Here I am", said I to chaos.

7
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,250
"I am your slave!"
And he: "Good."

8
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,410
"For what?" - said I.

9
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,690
Free in the end, I am!
What good is a caress when bliss...

10
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,450
this man came to possess?

11
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,370
Here I am, ready.

12
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,170
The trains are gone,
the brakes are gone.

13
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,610
And I can resist no more.
Go, sweet Bacchus, take me.

14
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,650
The brakes are gone!
The brakes are gone!

15
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,000
I heard you.

16
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,210
- No, they're really gone!
- Hit the brakes!

17
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,170
Weren't you reciting a poem?

18
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,210
It doesn't work!

19
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,930
Brake!

20
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,250
We're going to die! The woods!

21
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,410
Brake!

22
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,650
The king is coming!

23
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,050
There he is!

24
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,730
It's full of people
down there. Straight.

25
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,370
We have no brakes!

26
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,060
We have no brakes! Move!

27
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,650
Go for a walk.

28
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,900
Otherwise, we'll get there tomorrow.

29
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,980
I found the screw.

30
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,700
Now what do you need?

31
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,660
Nothing. I need ten minutes alone.

32
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,420
All right, I'll leave you alone.

33
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,700
Do you want the screw from before?

34
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,940
No, I want to be alone.

35
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,900
Do I toss out the screw, if I find it?

36
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,900
I need ten minutes alone.

37
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,180
I'm washing my hands.

38
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,660
Pretty girl! How's it going?

39
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,340
What are you doing?

40
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,850
Did your mom put this stuff here?

41
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,700
No, the landlady did.

42
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,460
Is it a market? It's beautiful.

43
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,580
How much is it? How old are you?

44
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,020
- What's your name?
- Eleonora.

45
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,260
Nice to meet you. I'm Prince Guido.

46
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,220
- Prince?
- I'm a prince, I am.

47
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,140
All this is mine.

48
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,420
Here starts the prince's principate.

49
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,780
I'll call this place Addis Ababa.

50
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:48,380
I'll change it all. Out go
the cows, in come the camels.

51
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,540
Camels?

52
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,780
Even a few hippopotamus.

53
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,940
I must go. I'm meeting
with the princess.

54
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,530
- When?
- Now!

55
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,060
Good morning, Princess!

56
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:07,470
How frightening. I almost
killed myself. Did I hurt you?

57
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,150
I've never been better.

58
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,830
Do you always leave the house like this?

59
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,670
I wanted to burn that
wasps nest, but I got stung.

60
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,100
A wasp stung you? There? Allow me.

61
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,510
Hold still, Princess.

62
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,990
A wasp's poison is very dangerous.

63
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,710
You have to get it out.

64
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,070
- Lie down. It'll take a while.
- No, thank you.

65
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,230
- Did you get stung anywhere else?
- No, thank you.

66
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,790
What a place here! It's beautiful!

67
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,750
Pigeons fly, women fall from
the sky. I'm moving here!

68
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,630
It's all his! He wants to fill it,
with camels! He's a prince!

69
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,550
Exactly.

70
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,710
Prince Guido at your service, Princess.

71
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,550
I'm coming!

72
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,630
Goodbye, then.

73
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,070
- How can I thank you?
- There's no need.

74
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,190
If you really want to thank me...

75
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,550
I'll take some eggs, to make
a nice omelet, for my squire.

76
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,670
Take whatever you want. It's all yours.

77
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,990
Thank you!

78
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,990
I'll take two... six.
All right? I'll make a nice omelet.

79
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,110
Goodbye, Eleonora! My regards, Princess.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,070
Farewell.

81
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,150
Here I am, Nuvolari!
Tonight's special: Omelet!

82
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,190
All camels here!

83
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,260
- Where is this house?
- Turn left. We're almost there.

84
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,350
Is your uncle sleeping with us?

85
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,430
He's lived in the hotel for 30 years.

86
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,550
He's the head maitre.

87
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,550
He's lending us the house.
He uses it for storage.

88
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,870
There. We're here.

89
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,150
That's Robin Hood, my uncle's horse.

90
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,270
Here's my uncle's buggy
and my uncle's house.

91
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,230
And inside is my uncle.

92
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,920
Hello, dear uncle!
Here we are! Hurry, it's late.

93
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,840
Here we are. The car broke down!

94
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,320
Uncle!

95
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,360
- Barbarians.
- Who were they?

96
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,640
- Barbarians.
- Why didn't you cry for help?

97
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,330
Silence is the most powerful cry.

98
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,240
Is he your poet friend?

99
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,640
My name is Ferruccio.
I'm also an upholsterer.

100
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,360
Here you are. It's an old
storehouse, full of odds and ends.

101
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,840
An old passion...
an odd and end in itself!

102
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,200
What's all this stuff for?

103
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,400
You can stay as long as you want.
It's not easy to be a waiter.

104
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,600
That's the bed. Legend has it,
Garibaldi slept there.

105
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,640
Nothing is more necessary,
than the unnecessary.

106
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,040
Barbarians.

107
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,640
The town hall is on Via Sestani,
to the right after the colonnade.

108
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:46,200
The bathroom, equipped with
the invention, of Mr. Bidet.

109
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:50,030
There are a few books here,
among which, The Life of Petrarch.

110
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:54,960
The kitchen is in there. This is a
velocipede, commonly called a bike.

111
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:59,120
I have to get back to the hotel.
There's only one key. Don't lose it.

112
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:04,000
It's so good to see you.
I'm coming, Robin Hood!

113
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,880
What an uncle!

114
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,480
Look at this!

115
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,880
Didn't I tell you? We're in a city.
You can do whatever you want.

116
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,680
If you want to do something, you do it.

117
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,190
You want to let yourself go?
You want to yell? Yell!

118
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,640
Stop it! What are you, crazy?

119
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,600
You can not act,
like you do in the country.

120
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,450
You've been yelling like a madman.

121
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,160
You can't yell!

122
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,000
Mary! The key!

123
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,800
See? You can't yell.

124
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:45,530
Understand? If you stopped
thinking, so much about poetry...

125
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,360
you'd make your father happier
and you'd make more money than him.

126
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,490
That's right, Oreste.
That's what I tell him too.

127
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,730
You have to settle down!

128
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,450
What a nice hat. How does it look?

129
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,090
- Nice. How does it look?
- Nice, but it's mine.

130
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,210
When do I start working?

131
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,530
You're already late. Right away!

132
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,220
Get that armchair and
take it to the workshop.

133
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:10,370
- That one?
- That one. And be careful!

134
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,250
Good. I'm going to
the town hall. Goodbye.

135
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,090
Goodbye, and behave yourselves...

136
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,600
because these are hard times.

137
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,330
Hard, hard times!

138
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,290
They're hard times?

139
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,330
Why, what are your political views?

140
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,530
Benito! Adolph! Be good!

141
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,450
What did you say?

142
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,650
I said, how are things going?

143
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,650
Goodbye, then.

144
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,330
Careful! You'll break the legs!

145
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,090
Goodbye!

146
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,170
He pulled it off. He took my hat.
I'll find him though.

147
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,490
Benito, you're going to get a slap!

148
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:59,210
I need to do the whole bureaucratic
procedure, to open a bookstore.

149
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,610
- Does it take a long time?
- Years.

150
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,530
Then we'd better open a file now.

151
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,090
First you apply, and the
department head has to sign it.

152
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,450
I almost scrambled my eggs.
I've had them since yesterday.

153
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,490
I forgot about them. Thank God,
they didn't break. Take note.

154
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,330
I, the undersigned, Guido Orefice...

155
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,170
- am applying to open...
- He can't sign it now!

156
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,330
What's going on?

157
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,840
I need your signature
to open a bookstore.

158
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,900
- Miss, what's going on?
- Mr. Rodolfo, I told him.

159
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,380
- Just one signature.
- No, I can't.

160
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,890
My substitute will be
here, in an hour. Ask him.

161
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,540
- All I need is a signature.
- We close at one here!

162
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,620
It's ten to one.

163
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,100
File a complaint.

164
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,220
Boy, is he nasty.

165
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,780
To sign a paper, open a file,
all he had to do was...

166
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,860
Now I have to wait one
hour, for his substitute.

167
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,340
I'm filing a complaint.
Write, "I, the undersigned..."

168
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,460
What a wallop!

169
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,340
Are you hurt? I'll help you.

170
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,060
Come here. I didn't do it on purpose.

171
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,700
Don't touch me!

172
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,860
You can forget about your bookshop!

173
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,050
No, the eggs!

174
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,100
You scoundrel! I'll kill you!

175
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,580
Out of the way!

176
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,580
Good morning, Princess.

177
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,740
I wonder, if we'll ever bump
into each other, standing up.

178
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,460
Excuse me, but I've got to run.

179
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,050
Farewell, Princess!

180
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,410
- Chicken.
- That's easy.

181
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,220
It's served whole,
bottom down on the plate.

182
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,100
"Will you cut it for me?"
"Naturally."

183
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,670
I stick the blade under the wing,
then I rip off the drumstick.

184
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,430
I cut the meat along the
bottom of the breastbone.

185
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,120
- Off go the wings, breast and skin.
- Lobster.

186
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,540
Piece of cake, Uncle.

187
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,590
I stick the wing under the leg.

188
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,070
Off goes the leg. I rip off
the lobster, stick the...

189
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,270
Lobster is a crustacean.

190
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,590
Off goes the crust... of the crustacean.

191
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,660
Off go the crust and antennae.
Who eats the antennae?

192
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,510
Off go the antennae,
off goes the lobster.

193
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,070
There's nothing left.

194
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,910
We're out of lobster,
but the chicken is delicious.

195
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,270
- I don't remember how to do lobster.
- You serve it as is.

196
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,350
There's no need to touch it!

197
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,670
That's too easy.
That's why I didn't remember.

198
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,470
- Continue.
- Behavior!

199
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,590
Stand by. Still, like this.

200
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,430
"Waiter?" - "Yes?"

201
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,990
In position. Stand by behavior. Waiter!

202
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,420
Why only me? There must be,
other waiters, right?

203
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,590
Bowing! Piece of cake.

204
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,350
You bow down, further.

205
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,260
Like this, at a 45 degree angle,
just like a champagne bottle.

206
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,270
45 degrees, even 50 or 55.

207
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,190
90 degrees. A right angle. 180.

208
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,550
How far do I bow down?
180 degrees? Like this?

209
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,510
Think of a sunflower.
They bow to the sun.

210
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,070
But if you see some,
that are too bowed down...

211
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,710
it means they're dead!

212
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,110
You're serving. You're not a servant.

213
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,310
Serving is a supreme art.

214
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,790
God is the first servant.

215
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,950
God serves men, but he's
not a servant, to men.

216
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,990
- There was no button here.
- It doesn't go there, silly.

217
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,270
I have to take the car back to Pop.
He's counting on it.

218
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,270
You'll take it back in a month or so.

219
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,160
No, I've got to get it
back soon. You know why?

220
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,880
Why?

221
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,520
- What? What time is it?
- Were you sleeping?

222
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,880
Of course I was.

223
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,720
You fell asleep while talking to me!

224
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,080
- How did you do that?
- Schopenhauer.

225
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,880
Who?

226
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,440
Schopenhauer says that with willpower,
you can do anything.

227
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,360
"I am what I want to be."

228
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,480
Right now I want to sleep,
so I was saying to myself...

229
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,760
"I'm sleeping, sleeping",
and I fell asleep.

230
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,000
Amazing. And it's simple too.

231
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:46,200
I want to try too.
I'm sleeping, sleeping, sleeping...

232
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,200
Don't move your hands.
You're not a juggler.

233
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,560
It's a matter of thought.
It's serious, and it takes time.

234
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,520
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

235
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,320
Amazing, though.

236
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,640
Wake up.

237
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:05,230
Wake up.

238
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,080
What is it now? What are you doing?

239
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,320
- It totally works!
- What works?

240
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,280
Schopenhauer. You know
what I just said? "Wake up".

241
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,560
Bam, you woke up.
This theory is incredible.

242
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,040
- How does it work?
- You were yelling in my ear!

243
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,840
That's why I woke up.

244
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,160
- So I should say it quieter.
- Don't say it at all!

245
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,720
It's deep. You have to think it.

246
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,000
Why are you running? Slow down!

247
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,480
Hurry up. It's late!

248
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,520
Mary, the key!

249
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,520
Every morning, she throws the key.

250
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,920
Look!

251
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,730
There's that teacher.
Boy, is she pretty.

252
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,010
I even dreamt about her.
Come with me. I'll introduce you.

253
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,050
- Holy smokes! Stay still!
- What is it?

254
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,450
Don't move!

255
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,530
The one in the car.
He's that jerk the eggs fell on.

256
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,810
He'll kill me if he sees me. Be good.

257
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,010
- What's he doing?
- He's talking.

258
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,090
- What's he saying?
- How do I know?

259
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,570
- What's he doing?
- He's saying goodbye.

260
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,010
He's got a car just
like mine! There he is!

261
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,850
Don't move. He'll kill me if he sees me!

262
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,330
Stay still, Ferruccio.

263
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,280
Good morning, Princess!

264
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,010
It's you again. How do you do this?

265
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,570
This is the princess, who fell
from the sky into my arms.

266
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,810
Is he the one, who sucked the
stinger out of your thigh?

267
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,890
Yes. We keep meeting like this.
You just suddenly show up.

268
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,170
We could make plans to meet.

269
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,680
- Tonight at 8:00?
- No, it's nicer this way.

270
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,330
Let's go, Dora. You'll be late.

271
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,040
I hope we meet again suddenly.

272
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,210
Farewell, Princess!

273
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,370
Did you see her? She's pretty, huh?

274
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,690
She likes it when I suddenly appear.

275
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,840
I don't believe it.

276
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,250
"Obscurity."

277
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,930
You're a genius!

278
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,890
"The bigger it is, the less you see it."

279
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,610
Solution: Obscurity.

280
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,300
Marvelous. Did you make that riddle up?

281
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,850
No, but you solved it in five minutes.
It took me eight days.

282
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,530
Obscurity!

283
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,290
Salmon, salad and a glass of white wine.

284
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,490
Listen to this one, Guido.

285
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,460
If I may, it's my turn.

286
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,540
My pop told me this,
when I was a wee boy.

287
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,130
"The dwarves and Snow White,
sit down for a bite.

288
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:46,540
How fast can you guess,
what she serves her guests next?"

289
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,980
It sounds refined.

290
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,100
I want to solve it, right now.

291
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:57,420
- Eat first or it'll get cold.
- I don't want to. It's too late.

292
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,580
Salad, salmon, white wine. It's light.

293
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,500
The dwarves...

294
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,460
and Snow White.

295
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:10,700
- Is the kitchen closed?
- Everybody's gone. Why?

296
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,780
A gentleman from Rome is here,
from the Ministry. He wants to eat.

297
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,420
The kitchen is closed.

298
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,900
Oh, well, he would have
given you a good tip.

299
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,820
The kitchen is open.

300
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,060
Come right in.

301
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,020
Doctor, you're not eating anything?

302
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,180
"The dwarves and Snow White..."

303
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,580
I know the kitchen is closed.
Maybe a cold dish.

304
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:47,180
- It's all delicious. Take your pick.
- Something light.

305
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:50,060
Well, we've got meat,
a nice heavy steak...

306
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,380
lamb, kidneys, some
greasy breaded liver.

307
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,810
- Otherwise, there's fish.
- Fish.

308
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,140
We have... a nice fatty turbot...

309
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,340
eel, stuffed with fatty sausage,
and greased with Grand Marnier...

310
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,100
or some lean salmon...

311
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,460
The salmon, thank you.

312
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:09,020
- Side dish?
- There's a side dish too?

313
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,020
Of course. We have very,
very fried mushrooms...

314
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,620
buttered potatoes in Nancy butter,
with a flaky sauce...

315
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,340
Is there a small, light salad?
If not, nothing.

316
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:26,060
A light salad? What a pity.
The very, very fried mushrooms...

317
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,660
were out of this world.
So, a light salad...

318
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,150
a lean salmon and a glass of white wine.

319
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,430
Perfect. As soon as possible.

320
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,350
I'll do my best.

321
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,510
"How fast can you guess,
what she serves her guests next?"

322
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,830
Right.

323
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,790
- "The dwarves and Snow White."
- Good night, Doctor.

324
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,950
Good night, genius.

325
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,120
What did he say?

326
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,550
The dwarves? What is he, drunk?

327
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,310
It's a riddle. "Seven seconds".

328
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,910
"Seven seconds" is the solution.
"The dwarves and Snow White."

329
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,150
If there are seven dwarves dining...

330
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,510
and she serves seconds,
that means "seven seconds".

331
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,190
Doctor Lessing is a physician,
a very serious person.

332
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,390
But he's obsessed with riddles.
He loses sleep over them.

333
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,750
Excuse me, the "Francesco
Petrarca" school.

334
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,340
The elementary school?

335
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,550
A friend of mine teaches there.
It's beautiful.

336
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,870
It's not far from here. Why?

337
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,300
Good. I can sleep an extra half hour.

338
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,710
Do you have to go, to that
school, tomorrow morning?

339
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,470
They're expecting me at 8:30.

340
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,830
Please, children, silence!
A moment of attention.

341
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,870
The inspector from Rome,
will be here shortly.

342
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,990
I want to make a good impression on him.

343
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,590
Listen very quietly and
carefully to what he says.

344
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,790
He'll tell us some very important
things about our beautiful country.

345
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,440
The inspector is here, ma'am.

346
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:14,080
He's already here? He's early!

347
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,720
Sit down, Roberto!

348
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,470
All rise!

349
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,360
Good morning, Princess.

350
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,720
Good morning, Mr. Inspector.
I'm the principal.

351
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,960
These are some of our teachers.

352
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,800
Good.

353
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,320
Therefore...

354
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,640
How many years have you
taught, in this school district?

355
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,080
Sixteen.

356
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,000
Are you up to date, with the ongoing...

357
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,160
school program, approved
by the Ministry this year?

358
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,600
Yes.

359
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:05,480
Did you read the bulletin,
regarding childhood hygiene?

360
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,400
Of course.

361
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,800
What are you doing on Sunday?

362
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:16,480
No, I mean, Sunday is St. Mary's Day.
What are you doing?

363
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,840
I'm going to the theater.

364
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,040
- To see what?
- Offenbach.

365
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,120
Right, they're playing Offenbach.

366
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,360
Fine. Well...

367
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:34,120
Thank you very much, and
goodbye. I just came to...

368
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,640
We know.

369
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,920
As you know, the inspector...

370
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,680
came from Rome to talk to us
about the race manifesto...

371
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:44,040
signed by the most well
versed Italian scientists.

372
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,200
He will, and we're very honored...

373
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,630
demonstrate to us that our race...

374
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,560
is a superior race...

375
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,760
the best of all.

376
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,610
Take your seats.

377
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,880
Go ahead, Inspector.

378
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,580
- Our race...
- Is superior.

379
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,010
Naturally!

380
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,210
Our race is superior.

381
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:10,730
I've just come from Rome,
right this minute...

382
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,010
to come and tell you in order
that, you'll know, children...

383
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,930
that our race is a superior one.

384
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,810
I was...

385
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,930
chosen, I was, by racist
Italian scientists...

386
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,850
in order to demonstrate...

387
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,490
how superior our race is.

388
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:30,160
Why did they pick me, children?

389
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,170
Must I tell you?

390
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,610
Where can you find...

391
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,730
someone more handsome than me?

392
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,560
Justly so, there is silence.
I'm an original "superior race"...

393
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,010
pure Aryan.

394
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,810
Children.

395
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,770
Let's start with something that one says:
"What's so big about that?"

396
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,170
The ear. Look at the
perfection of this ear.

397
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,680
Left auricle...

398
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,250
with a pendant little bell at the end.

399
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,130
Check it out. Movable cartilage.

400
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,770
Bendable.

401
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,610
Find two ears more beautiful
than these and I'll leave!

402
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,410
But you have to show me them.
They dream about these in France!

403
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,370
Races exists, children. You bet they do!

404
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,540
But let's continue.

405
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,490
I want to show you something else.

406
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,210
Pay attention.

407
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,450
He said Inspector?

408
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,410
From Rome?

409
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,610
The belly button!

410
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,890
Take a look at this
belly button! What a knot!

411
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,170
But you can't untie it,
not even with your teeth!

412
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,050
Those racist scientists tried it.
Not a chance!

413
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:42,010
This is an Italian belly button.
It's part of our race!

414
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,050
Check out this style!

415
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:48,780
Look at these muscles:
Caps, biceps, triceps!

416
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,700
Look at this beauty! Admire this hip!

417
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,740
Just look at the movement!

418
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:59,980
Gentlemen!

419
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,220
I must say goodbye now.

420
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:07,220
I have to go. I have an appointment.

421
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,910
I'll make my Aryan exit
and bid you farewell.

422
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,740
Farewell! The belly button!

423
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,900
I'll see you in Venice, Princess.

424
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,260
I can only hear out of this ear.

425
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,150
Look at me, Princess.

426
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,070
Go on, I'm down here.

427
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,550
Look at me, Princess.

428
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,480
Turn around, Princess.

429
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,110
Turn around, around...

430
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,030
- Can we get a chocolate ice cream?
- Yes, but we'll have to be quick.

431
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,270
Why?

432
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,810
We have to be at the Prefect's at eight.

433
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,390
We were invited to dinner.

434
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,190
- Where?
- At the Prefect's.

435
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,990
Have pity on me, Lord.
Let it not be true.

436
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,070
- Another dinner at the Prefect's?
- Your mother is coming too.

437
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,510
Bingo!

438
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,420
Let's us just go to dinner.

439
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:07,070
We'll stop by the Prefect's for coffee.

440
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,150
I'm not coming!

441
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,710
All right, I heard you!
I'll tell him we're not going.

442
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,950
It'll just be me and you.

443
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,240
- Good evening, Rodolfo!
- Good evening, Mr. Prefect.

444
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:21,910
I'll see you later at my house.
I'll expect you at 8:00.

445
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,840
We'll be there at 8:00 sharp.

446
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:30,280
Where is she? Did you see her?

447
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,640
- She has to be here.
- You're here?

448
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,680
On time tomorrow, got it?

449
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:39,080
Did you take that stuff out of the car?

450
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,670
It's silk. Don't ruin it.
Be very careful.

451
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,800
- What an opera.
- Beautiful!

452
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,920
Is that one of your curtains?

453
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:53,960
No, it must be one of my colleague's.

454
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,360
He took my hat again!

455
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,520
- Let's go.
- Don't you see how it's raining?

456
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:04,210
- You go get the car.
- It's right around the corner.

457
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,560
All right, you wait here.

458
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:09,880
I'll pull up right here and toot.

459
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:13,080
Give me the key!

460
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,240
Not the house key! The car key!

461
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:18,840
The car key? Are you crazy?

462
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,480
Keep him busy, you know,
the jerk, the eggs fell on.

463
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,960
Keep him busy as long as you can.
I'll see you tonight.

464
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:26,160
Inside the car there's... Go slow!

465
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,960
The least you could have done,
is come get me with the umbrella.

466
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,840
You're just plain rude.
Look what a mess I am.

467
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:51,800
Plus, dinner at the Prefect's,
gets me so nervous!

468
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:55,560
I knew it. I've got the hiccups.

469
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:59,640
I always get them, when I'm made
to do something, I don't want to.

470
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:02,680
Don't you know, that it takes
so little, to make me happy?

471
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:05,400
A chocolate ice cream,
is enough! Even two!

472
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:08,840
A nice walk together and
then whatever happens, happens.

473
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:11,090
Instead you...

474
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,970
Good morning, Princess!

475
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,490
This is incredible.
You owe me an explanation.

476
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:21,330
No, you're the one who
owes me an explanation!

477
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,250
I stop under a roof and you
fall from the sky into my arms.

478
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:27,130
I fall off my bicycle
and end up in your arms.

479
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,930
I do an inspection at school,
and there you are again!

480
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,210
You even turn up in my dreams.

481
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:37,930
Will you leave me alone?
You've really got a crush on me.

482
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,850
I don't blame you, but...

483
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,290
All right. At this point,
I give in. You win.

484
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:46,370
Where shall we go, Princess?
To the sea! Do you like the sea?

485
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,490
Yes, but they're waiting for me,
at the theater. Take me back.

486
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,810
What's happening?

487
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:55,530
Princess, do you know how to
turn on the windshield wipers?

488
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,490
Step on the brakes!

489
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,810
Have no fear! Hang on to me!

490
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,730
It's broken!

491
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,770
When did you learn to drive?

492
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,170
- Ten minutes ago.
- I thought it was less than that.

493
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,170
- The top doesn't close.
- The door won't open.

494
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,930
Wait! We're stuck!

495
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,520
We'll get out of here.
I'll take care of it.

496
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,690
The important thing is,
that you don't get wet.

497
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,810
Cover yourself with this.

498
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,890
Take it. We'll get out of here now.

499
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,170
I'll take care of everything.

500
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,650
Here we go.

501
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,890
Step right out, Princess.

502
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,770
There! Step right out!

503
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,850
There's a huge puddle!
You'll get your feet wet! Wait!

504
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,130
Here!

505
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,540
- Go ahead, Princess.
- Where are we?

506
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:58,420
We've already been here.

507
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:02,020
- Me and you? When?
- Don't you remember?

508
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,820
The night it was raining...

509
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:06,250
and I made you an umbrella,
out of a pillow!

510
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:07,810
It was a beautiful night.

511
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,220
I put the steering wheel,
on my shoulder...

512
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,820
did a little waltz, and when
I stopped in front of you...

513
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,090
you kissed me.

514
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,140
Princess, your behind
is blowing in the wind.

515
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:35,650
It depends on the person.
My pop was like that.

516
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,580
He had the ability,
to make me do anything.

517
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,980
He understood me.
He knew how to deal with me.

518
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:43,100
I was like putty in his hand.

519
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,790
I always, always, always said yes.

520
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,780
So, all these treasures you're hiding...

521
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:54,460
there is a way, to open this treasure
chest, and always get you to say yes!

522
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,700
It's easier, than you think.

523
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:59,130
- All you need is the right key.
- And where exactly is it?

524
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:01,570
Heaven knows.

525
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,380
It's clearing up.

526
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,890
So, you were saying...

527
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:09,380
the key that always makes you
say yes, has to come from heaven.

528
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,570
Yes.

529
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,820
I'll give it a try.

530
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:17,340
If the Virgin Mary tosses it
down to me... You never know.

531
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,380
Mary, the key!

532
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,900
Is this it?

533
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:28,900
Do you really have to go home?
What about the chocolate ice cream?

534
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,860
- Let's get it right now.
- No, not now.

535
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,260
- Then when?
- I don't know.

536
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:36,220
Are we going to let
heaven decide that too?

537
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,720
No, leave Mary alone.

538
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:40,110
Don't bother her over an ice cream!

539
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,750
No, it's way too important.
We can't decide when to have it.

540
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,340
I have to ask her.

541
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,470
Mary, send someone to find out...

542
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,230
how long before we
can have the ice cream!

543
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,510
Seven seconds!

544
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,430
- This is my house.
- I've gone by here a thousand times.

545
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,470
I've always asked myself:
Who lives there?

546
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,870
I wanted to open my
store right out front.

547
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,630
- The bookshop?
- Yes. I'll see you every day.

548
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,270
Goodbye then.

549
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,670
You've been so nice to me.
All I want now is a hot bath.

550
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,990
I forgot to tell you.

551
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,710
Go ahead.

552
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,550
You can't imagine how much,
I feel like making love to you.

553
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,830
But I'll never tell anyone,
especially not you.

554
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,870
They'd have to torture
me to make me say it.

555
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,910
- Say what?
- That I want to make love to you.

556
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,150
Not just once. Over and over again!

557
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,870
But I'll never tell you that.

558
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,430
I'd have to be crazy to tell you
I'd even make love to you now...

559
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,350
right here, for the rest of my life.

560
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,270
You'd better run or you'll get wet.
It's going to rain again.

561
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,150
Princess.

562
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,950
- You're all wet.
- My suit is no big deal.

563
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,710
It's that hat that bothers me.

564
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,110
I need a dry hat,
but where can I find one?

565
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,630
How did it go? Right, it's easy!

566
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,540
Mary, send someone to
give my friend, a dry hat.

567
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,710
Good night, Princess. Farewell.

568
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:39,080
- Excuse me, where's the restroom?
- Straight ahead to the left.

569
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:49,560
If you don't get up immediately...

570
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:53,440
I swear on your father's deathbed,
I'll never speak to you again.

571
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,120
For the rest of my life!

572
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,320
I'm going to count, to three now.

573
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,720
If you don't get up,
I'll force you to get up.

574
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:16,280
Good girl.

575
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,680
Do you know, who's getting married?

576
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,600
Didn't I tell you?
That jerk the eggs fell on!

577
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:27,080
- Who's he marrying?
- I don't know.

578
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,240
But she hasn't, even shown up yet.

579
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:31,440
Everybody's waiting.

580
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,600
I've looked everywhere, for you!

581
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,760
- Your uncle.
- My uncle?

582
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:37,760
Something's happened. Come with me!

583
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,680
Outside! The horse!

584
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:44,280
What's that?

585
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:46,400
Is that your horse?

586
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:49,040
What a sight!
What did they write on him?

587
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:52,040
"Achtung, Jewish horse."

588
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:56,240
The usual barbarians, vandals.
It's sad. What nonsense.

589
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,640
"Jewish horse!"

590
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:01,800
Don't get upset. They just did it to...

591
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:04,760
They didn't do it "to".
They did it "to".

592
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:08,040
You'll have to get used to it, Guido.

593
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:10,760
- They'll start with you too.
- With me?

594
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:13,080
What could possibly, happen to me?

595
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:15,770
The worst they can do is undress me,
paint me yellow and write...

596
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,890
"Achtung, Jewish waiter."

597
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,050
I didn't even know,
this horse was Jewish.

598
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,480
Let's go. I'll clean
him up in the morning.

599
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,410
Take him back, to the stall.

600
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,400
Look, there, in front of you!

601
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,810
Wait. I'll surprise her.

602
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,530
Come with me. I'd like to
introduce you, to Fido Giovanardi.

603
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:18,450
Doctor Lessing! Where are you going?

604
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,850
Urgent telegram.

605
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,490
I must go to Berlin, immediately.

606
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:26,330
- What are these flowers?
- They're for your departure.

607
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,010
I'll take just one.

608
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,290
I'll take it to my wife: Guido's flower.

609
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,410
I truly enjoyed myself, with you.

610
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,330
You're the most ingenious...

611
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,970
waiter, I've ever come across.

612
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:45,130
Thank you. You're the customer with
the most culture, I've ever served.

613
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,810
Thank you.

614
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,730
Goodbye, Doctor Lessing.

615
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,650
By the way.

616
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:55,370
"If you say my name...

617
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,880
I'm not there anymore. Who am I?"

618
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,660
If you say my name,
I'm not there anymore.

619
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,860
What is it? What did he say?

620
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,340
"Silence!"

621
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:16,660
Beautiful. If you say the word,
it's not there anymore. Silence.

622
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:22,460
I'm not talking about Berlin,
in the outskirts. Imagine that!

623
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,340
Third grade. Listen to this problem.

624
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,220
I remember it because it shocked me.

625
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:32,340
A lunatic costs the state,
four marks a day.

626
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,620
A cripple, four and a half marks.

627
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:37,380
An epileptic, three marks and a half.

628
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:40,820
Considering that the average,
is four marks a day...

629
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:44,220
and there are 300,000 patients,
how much would the state save...

630
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:46,980
if these individuals, were eliminated?

631
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,380
I can't believe this!

632
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:52,020
That was my exact reaction.

633
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:55,100
I can't believe,
a seven-year-old child...

634
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:57,060
has to solve this kind of equation.

635
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:01,140
It's a difficult calculation.
Proportions, percentages.

636
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:03,420
They need at least some algebra,
to do those equations.

637
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,340
That's high school material for us.

638
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:09,380
No, all it takes is multiplication.
You said there are 300,000 cripples?

639
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,260
300,000 times four.

640
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:15,500
If we killed them all,
we'd save 1,200,000 marks a day.

641
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:18,090
- It's easy!
- Exactly!

642
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,380
But you're an adult.

643
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:22,460
They make seven-year-old-children,
do this in Germany!

644
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,380
It's truly another race.

645
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:28,970
"Good morning, Princess."

646
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:33,700
- What did you say?
- It's here, on the cake.

647
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,350
Why are you just
standing there? Let's go!

648
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,310
Let's dance.

649
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,550
Just a few words.
You already know it all by now...

650
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,670
and you've known for several years.

651
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,790
Dora and I were born on the same street.

652
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,590
We went to school together,
we had the same friends.

653
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,750
Dora is the woman of my life...

654
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,110
and I'm the man in
her life, therefore...

655
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,750
we've decided to get
married, within the year.

656
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,590
You're all officially invited.
on April the 9th...

657
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,230
to the Basilica of
Santa Maria del Pellegrino.

658
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:02,470
And then we'll celebrate till dawn,
all together, right here...

659
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,710
just as happy, as we are now.

660
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,380
Kiss her! Kiss her!

661
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,150
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

662
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,150
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

663
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,580
Who put this armchair, here?

664
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,110
Are you all right?

665
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,190
- I'm fine.
- I'm sorry.

666
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,310
- I didn't get hurt.
- No, I was talking about...

667
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,550
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- It's going fine.

668
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,630
Go back to your table.

669
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,560
Go on. I can do this.

670
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:49,080
Are you all right?

671
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:52,020
Fine! Why are you all asking me that?

672
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:53,920
Is there something wrong?

673
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:56,760
No, nothing is wrong.

674
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,760
But... Go to the kitchen.

675
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:06,310
The kitchen.

676
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:08,640
They moved everything around tonight.

677
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:10,800
Look where they put the kitchen.

678
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:22,490
Peek-a-boo! Guess who?

679
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:25,800
It's me! What, have you gone soft?

680
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,190
Miss.

681
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:30,960
We finally meet, Dora.

682
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:35,320
He never introduced us.
You were scared to, weren't you?

683
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:38,990
Now you don't need to come
with us, to the brothel anymore!

684
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:42,280
I apologize if I've disrupted you.
Happiness and best wishes to all.

685
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:44,240
You sly old dog!

686
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:46,960
What a jolly fellow!

687
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:54,280
Everything is just fine.
I'll pick it all up.

688
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:56,280
I apologize.

689
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,400
Princess!

690
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:10,320
You're here too?

691
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:25,610
Take me away.

692
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,570
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

693
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:46,320
a magnificent surprise,
offered by the Grand Hotel.

694
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,840
The Ethiopian cake!

695
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:43,330
Thank you! Music, maestro!

696
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,970
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

697
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,050
Right this way, Princess.

698
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:55,730
But you're...

699
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,530
Quickly, Princess.

700
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,940
But he's...

701
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:26,260
He's that jerk, with the eggs!

702
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:01,940
Ferruccio!

703
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:05,140
He's got the keys to
the house, darn it all!

704
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:12,940
Some wire. I can open
it if, I find some wire.

705
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:17,220
I'm a whiz with wire. My pop taught me.

706
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:20,540
I used to make toys out of wire,
when I was a kid.

707
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:29,500
I opened it.

708
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:57,740
Joshua!

709
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,390
Let's go. You're going
to make Mommy late.

710
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,950
I lost my tank.

711
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,310
Don't worry. We'll find it.

712
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,870
Where did you leave the tank?

713
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,190
- It's on the stairs.
- I'll get it.

714
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,780
Hold the bicycle. I'll get it.

715
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,110
Here.

716
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,420
Let's go.

717
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,390
- Go, Pop!
- Go slow!

718
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,110
You're late for school! Go!

719
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,670
There's a horse! Two horses!

720
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,550
Stop ringing that bell!
It's driving me mad!

721
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:43,070
- It's not me, it's Joshua.
- It's not me, it's Pop!

722
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,990
Stop it! Let me off!

723
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,350
Here we are.

724
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,990
See you tonight.

725
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,590
Go fast, Pop!

726
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,270
Can we buy this for Mommy?

727
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,270
- How much does it cost?
- Fifteen lire.

728
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,630
It's a fake. It's probably
a fake cake, like your tank.

729
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,310
Let's go, Joshua.

730
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,670
"No Jews or dogs...

731
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,510
allowed."

732
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,310
Why aren't Jews or
dogs allowed to go in?

733
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,740
They just don't want
Jews or dogs to go in.

734
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,990
Everybody does what they want to.

735
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,070
There's a hardware store there.

736
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,000
They don't let Spanish people
or horses into his store.

737
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,920
Further ahead, there's a drugstore.

738
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:50,280
I was with a Chinese friend of
mine yesterday, who had a kangaroo.

739
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:51,110
I said, "May we?"

740
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:53,400
"No, we don't want any
Chinese or kangaroos here."

741
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:55,520
They don't like them.
What can I tell you?

742
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:58,160
We let everybody, into our bookshop.

743
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:00,080
No. From now on, we'll write it too.

744
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:02,560
- Is there anybody you don't like?
- Spiders. What about you?

745
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,040
I don't like Visigoths.
Starting tomorrow we'll write...

746
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:07,920
"No spiders and Visigoths allowed."

747
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:10,840
I'm sick and tired of these Visigoths.

748
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:20,440
Good morning.

749
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:22,600
Everything's half price.

750
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:25,760
- Guido Orefice?
- That's me.

751
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:29,280
- You have to come to the Prefect's.
- Again?

752
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:31,320
- He already went.
- Let's go.

753
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:32,400
Why?

754
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:37,920
- Is that man with you?
- Yes. Let's go.

755
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:39,320
All right.

756
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:41,080
- I'm coming too.
- No.

757
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:42,360
You stay here. It won't
take long, will it?

758
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,280
Not long at all.

759
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,710
Joshua, make sure you
treat the customers good!

760
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:50,440
I'll be right back.

761
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,220
- I'll take this one.
- It costs five lire.

762
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:56,810
No, it says ten lire.

763
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,580
Everything's half price.

764
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:05,860
Give this to your mom and
tell her, it's from Grandma.

765
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:09,370
I've never seen my grandma before.

766
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:12,020
- Would you like to meet her?
- Yes.

767
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:14,940
You'll meet her tomorrow.

768
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:17,020
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

769
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:19,300
Because tomorrow is your birthday...

770
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:21,550
and your grandma will come.
and bring you a nice present.

771
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:24,620
A new tank?

772
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:26,790
No, a surprise.

773
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:28,700
Give the letter to your mom.

774
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:31,780
Bye, Joshua.

775
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:33,580
You forgot your change, Grandma.

776
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:41,100
Thank you.

777
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:44,390
- When are you coming?
- In an hour or so.

778
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:47,150
I'm going to stop by my uncle,
to see if he'll bring some leftovers.

779
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:51,270
- Then what did Grandma say?
- She's coming tomorrow.

780
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:55,020
It's about time!

781
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:56,900
JEWISH STORE

782
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:59,780
- It's time for your bath now.
- I don't want to take one.

783
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:02,630
- Go take a bath.
- I took one on Friday.

784
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:04,270
He's right.

785
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:06,190
You change your shirt.

786
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:08,590
- I changed it on Thursday!
- Don't forget the flowers!

787
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:11,020
They're outside. I already picked them.

788
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:14,940
- I'll come with you, Pop!
- You have to take a bath, stubborn!

789
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:17,460
I don't want to take one!

790
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:19,400
Hurry up. I have to go pick Grandma up.

791
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,800
- Where do you want the flowers?
- Set them down. I'll be right there.

792
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:41,680
I took one on Friday!

793
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:48,520
Do you know where Joshua is?

794
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:50,610
He must be in there.

795
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:52,520
Will you put those things, in order?

796
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:53,880
Why don't you show me, the flowers?

797
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:54,720
They look so beautiful.

798
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:57,410
They are. I'll bring them right over.
You want to see the flowers?

799
00:52:57,530 --> 00:53:00,300
I'll make them, come right over.

800
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:01,520
Come, flowers!

801
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:03,240
Come, nightstand!

802
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:06,170
Schopenhauer, willpower, I want
the nightstand to come here.

803
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:08,720
Nightstand, come.

804
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:12,440
Stop, nightstand!

805
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:15,650
The nightstand seems, very dirty to me.

806
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:18,840
Good morning, Princess!

807
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:25,090
He can already read and write?

808
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,680
- For over a year now.
- You did a good job.

809
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:29,770
We're here.

810
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:31,800
I'll help you get out.

811
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,730
No, I can do it myself.

812
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,730
Dora, what's wrong?

813
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:14,060
Are we there?

814
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:16,470
No, it's a crossing.

815
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:21,700
Will you tell me, where we're going now?

816
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:24,140
What do you mean, where?

817
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:27,070
You asked me a thousand times.
We're going...

818
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:29,620
to the place... What's it called?

819
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,380
We're going...

820
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,630
Where are we going?

821
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:37,460
What day is it today?
Today is your birthday!

822
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:39,980
You've always said you
wanted, to go on a trip!

823
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,070
It took me months to
plan this whole thing.

824
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:46,460
You know where we're going?

825
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:49,190
I can't tell you. I promised
Mom, I wouldn't tell.

826
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:51,030
You know how she is. She'll get mad.

827
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:53,150
It makes me laugh.

828
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,500
My pop planned something like
this for me when I was little too.

829
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,160
It was so... Boy, it was funny!

830
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,350
I'm not going to tell you.
I want you to see for yourself.

831
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,760
It's a surprise.
You know, it's really...

832
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,310
It really makes me laugh.

833
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,710
I'm tired.

834
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,670
Go to sleep.

835
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:26,150
Where are we going?
Where are they taking us?

836
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:48,750
What time is it?
We're leaving right on time.

837
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,520
What organization!

838
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:53,160
- You've never taken a train, huh?
- No. Is it nice?

839
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,680
It's really nice!

840
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,880
It's all wooden inside. Everybody
stands up. There's not one seat.

841
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,170
- There aren't any seats?
- What? Seats on a train?

842
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,360
It's obvious, you've never been on one!

843
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,570
No, everybody stands
real close together.

844
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,130
Do you see this line?

845
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:10,690
I got the last tickets just in time!

846
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:14,010
Hurry up, Uncle Eliseo.
I don't want them to say, "Too late.

847
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,650
It's full. Go back home."

848
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:19,130
Wait up. We've got a reservation!
Leave some room for us!

849
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,050
Look at this line!

850
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:25,420
Here we are! We made a reservation!

851
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:30,010
Thank you!

852
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:37,050
- May I help you?
- There's been a mistake.

853
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:39,570
What mistake?

854
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:42,300
My husband and son are on that train.

855
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:45,170
What's your husband's name?

856
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:47,370
Guido Orefice.

857
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:54,940
Joshua Orefice...

858
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:58,900
and Eliseo Orefice
are on that train too.

859
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:00,820
There's no mistake.

860
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,500
I want to get on that train too.

861
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:09,970
- We're all ready.
- Send them off then.

862
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:11,380
Go, leave!

863
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:16,710
Go back home, ma'am.

864
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:18,340
I want to get on that train.

865
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:29,500
Let me get on that train!

866
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,120
Mom's here!

867
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,520
They stopped the train,
to let Mom get on.

868
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:06,350
Uncle Eliseo.

869
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:48,150
Are you happy? Did you see
this place? Are you tired?

870
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:51,510
- I didn't like the train.
- Me either.

871
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:53,710
We'll take the bus back.

872
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:57,910
We're taking the bus back!
The one with the seats in it!

873
01:00:58,030 --> 01:01:00,710
- I told them.
- It's better.

874
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,910
You see? It's all organized!

875
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,670
Did you see that line?

876
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:09,270
People are lined up to get inside!

877
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:12,760
- Everybody wants to get in!
- What game is this?

878
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,520
That's it!

879
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,990
It's that game where...

880
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:19,350
It's the game...

881
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,280
We're all players.

882
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:25,170
It's all organized. The game is...

883
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:28,280
the men are over here,
the women are over there.

884
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:31,400
Then there's the soldiers.
They give us our schedule.

885
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:33,880
It's hard, you know. It's not easy.

886
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:37,560
If somebody makes a mistake,
they get sent right home.

887
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:39,570
That means, you have to be very careful.

888
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:43,000
But if you win, you get first prize!

889
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:45,280
What's the prize?

890
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,290
First prize!

891
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:51,640
- It's a tank.
- I already have one.

892
01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:55,290
This one's a real tank! Brand new!

893
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:57,450
Real?

894
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:00,170
Yes! I didn't want to tell you.

895
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:09,250
Where's Uncle Eliseo going?

896
01:02:09,370 --> 01:02:11,810
He's on another team.
It's all organized.

897
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:13,930
Bye, Uncle!

898
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:19,010
A real tank.

899
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:34,010
What did I tell you?

900
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:36,490
Fabulous!

901
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:38,530
What a place!

902
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:42,660
Hurry up or they'll steal our places.
We've got a reservation. Two singles!

903
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:45,890
Coming through!

904
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:48,210
There's our place!

905
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:55,180
This is our bed. We'll sleep real close.

906
01:02:57,220 --> 01:03:00,660
It's ugly here. It smells.
I want to be with Mommy.

907
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:02,700
We will be!

908
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:05,420
- I'm hungry!
- We'll eat!

909
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:08,670
Plus, they're really
mean here! They yell!

910
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:11,440
They yell, because
everybody wants first prize.

911
01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:12,630
They have to be tough.

912
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:17,390
- Can I see Mommy?
- When the game's over.

913
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:18,750
When's it over?

914
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:23,030
You have to get a thousand points.

915
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:26,910
Whoever gets a thousand
points, wins a tank.

916
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:29,710
I don't believe you.
Are we getting a snack?

917
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:32,190
A snack?

918
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:34,990
Just ask. We're all friends here.

919
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:37,790
- Look who's here. What's his name?
- Bartolomeo.

920
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,950
Let me ask you something.

921
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:43,070
Did the guy who hands out the
bread and jam already come by?

922
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:47,830
Darn it all! We missed him, by a second!

923
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:51,270
He'll come back again though, won't he?

924
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,960
He's coming back.

925
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,880
- What did he say?
- He asked if anyone speaks German.

926
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,070
He's going to explain the camp's rules.

927
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,520
- Do you speak German?
- No.

928
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:22,880
The game starts now. Whoever's
here is here, whoever's not is not.

929
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:28,860
The first one to get,
a thousand points wins.

930
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:29,920
The prize is a tank!

931
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:31,990
Lucky him!

932
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:44,160
Every day we'll announce, who's
in the lead from that loudspeaker.

933
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:47,010
The one with the least points,
has to wear a sign saying "jackass"...

934
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:48,360
right here on his back.

935
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:57,900
We play the part, of the
real mean guys, who yell.

936
01:04:58,020 --> 01:04:59,370
Whoever's scared, loses points.

937
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:17,450
You'll lose your points.
for three things.

938
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:20,410
One: If you cry.

939
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:23,300
Two: If you want to see your mommy.

940
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:26,700
Three: If you're hungry
and you want a snack.

941
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:28,260
Forget about it!

942
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:39,060
It's easy to lose points,
for being hungry.

943
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:41,260
Just yesterday, I lost 40 points...

944
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:44,020
because I absolutely had
to have, a jam sandwich.

945
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:48,820
Apricot jam! He wanted strawberry.

946
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:58,740
Don't ask for any lollipops.
You won't get any.

947
01:05:58,870 --> 01:06:00,380
We eat them all!

948
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:03,860
I ate 20 of them yesterday!

949
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:08,470
What a stomachache.
But they sure were good.

950
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:10,540
You bet.

951
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:21,580
Sorry if I'm going so fast,
but I'm playing hide and seek.

952
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:23,500
I have to go now or they'll find me.

953
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:34,590
Don't ask me anything.

954
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:36,980
Ask Bartolomeo. He knows everything.

955
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:39,350
Don't forget to tell me,
what he said too.

956
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:41,300
A thousand points?

957
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:43,670
I told you, we're going to have fun!

958
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,950
These guys are crazy!

959
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:49,790
This has to weigh a hundred kilos!
It's got to be 3,000 degrees in here!

960
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,280
Vittorino, I can't cope anymore!

961
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,120
- After only the first one?
- Why, are there more to move?

962
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:57,400
We're here until tonight!

963
01:06:57,530 --> 01:07:00,720
Bartolomeo, what happened?
Where are they taking you?

964
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:03,410
To the hospital. I hurt my arm.

965
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:06,880
We're going to die here!

966
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:10,840
I can't take it anymore!
I'm putting this down.

967
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:13,320
I'll tell them I can't do it.
What can they do to me?

968
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:15,880
They'll kill you!

969
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:20,200
- Where does this thing go?
- Down there.

970
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:22,890
Good Lord! I'll never make it!

971
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:32,880
It's got to be 10,000 degrees in here!

972
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:03,360
Pop!

973
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:21,140
Look here! See? It's nice, huh?

974
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:25,580
We're signed up.

975
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:28,860
When I got there to sign up...

976
01:08:28,990 --> 01:08:31,630
the referee was there and he said...

977
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:34,340
"No, you and your son
aren't on the list.

978
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:36,700
You didn't pay your dues."

979
01:08:36,830 --> 01:08:38,740
I almost fell over.

980
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:41,860
He said, "You can go home."
I said, "No, you go home!

981
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:44,590
Joshua and I signed up.

982
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:49,420
Give me my number!"
In fact, they gave me one. Look.

983
01:08:49,550 --> 01:08:53,060
I had them put it here,
too, just in case.

984
01:08:53,190 --> 01:08:55,150
See what a nice place...

985
01:08:56,230 --> 01:08:58,190
your pop takes you to?

986
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:02,870
Did you play with the other kids?

987
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:05,510
Yes, but they don't know the rules.

988
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:09,110
They said it isn't true,
that first prize is a tank.

989
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,300
They don't know anything,
about the points.

990
01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:14,790
Did you fall for that?
They're as sly as foxes.

991
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:16,830
They want to beat you! Are you joking?

992
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,390
There's no tank? Don't you believe them!

993
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:23,270
How many points, did we get today?

994
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,150
Fifty.

995
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:28,030
Forty-eight. They took two
points away from me, because...

996
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,220
I tripped, while I was...

997
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:32,470
playing hopscotch.

998
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,230
We...

999
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:38,950
laughed like crazy today!
I died laughing!

1000
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:40,880
Boy, did I have fun!

1001
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,280
I can't wait to start
all over again, tomorrow!

1002
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:46,950
Hopscotch, tug of war and
ring around the rosy.

1003
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,230
Every game. I don't even
remember all of them.

1004
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:52,870
"You guys are obsessed!
Stop! I'm tired!", I said.

1005
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,800
Listen.

1006
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:58,310
- Did you eat something?
- Yes, but I didn't ask for a snack.

1007
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:02,280
Good boy! That means
you got 12 points too!

1008
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,600
Forty-eight for me, 12 for you.

1009
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:05,920
Sixty points.

1010
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:09,080
This is what you get,
when you get up to 60.

1011
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:12,410
A plain piece of bread, no jam.

1012
01:10:12,530 --> 01:10:14,520
Here, eat this.

1013
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:20,490
- Is 60 points a lot?
- Are you kidding?

1014
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:22,050
It sure is!

1015
01:10:25,690 --> 01:10:28,080
Look who's here! Bartolomeo!

1016
01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:29,200
How'd it go?

1017
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:33,330
Any worse than this... I got 20 of them.

1018
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:39,530
We got more than him.

1019
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:41,880
Don't tell him that. We're in the lead!

1020
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:53,770
I already told you:
No children or old ladies!

1021
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:56,730
Back inside! You don't work!

1022
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:59,290
The rest, downstairs!

1023
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:02,220
Let's go, girls, quickly.
Come on. This way!

1024
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:06,140
That one's new. She learned right away.

1025
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:07,520
The lady at the door...

1026
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:09,570
she seemed nice, when she first came.

1027
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:11,420
She's the worst of all!

1028
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:14,180
At least she didn't send the
old ladies and children to work.

1029
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:17,690
They don't send old people and
kids to work, because they kill them!

1030
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:20,420
One of these days, they'll
call them to take a shower.

1031
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:22,260
"Children, shower time!"

1032
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:25,740
The truth is, they make them
shower, there in the gas chamber.

1033
01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:34,460
Downstairs!

1034
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:40,820
How can I do this?

1035
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:42,420
Vittorino!

1036
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:46,170
Where'd they find all these anvils?

1037
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:48,060
Pop!

1038
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:52,100
Why are you here?
You're not supposed to be here!

1039
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:53,870
Go away!

1040
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:56,220
Why aren't you, with the other kids?

1041
01:11:56,350 --> 01:11:58,020
They said...

1042
01:11:58,150 --> 01:12:01,110
all us kids have to take a
shower today, and I don't want to.

1043
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:04,590
- Go take a shower!
- No!

1044
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:07,510
I'm not going to.

1045
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,070
Go take a shower!

1046
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,640
What are you doing here?

1047
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:18,350
We're making... a tank.

1048
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:21,550
We're building the tank.
We're still working on the tracks.

1049
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,430
We're running slow.

1050
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:28,000
You can't stay here.
Go take your shower!

1051
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:31,000
I don't want to!

1052
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,230
You stubborn thing! I'll tell Mom!

1053
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:34,670
Ten points off for you!

1054
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:35,760
Hide behind there.

1055
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,880
We'll go back together, when I'm done.

1056
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,800
Don't let anyone see you!

1057
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,720
This sure is fun.

1058
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:56,640
Everything!

1059
01:12:56,770 --> 01:12:59,200
Take everything off! Hang it up there!

1060
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:02,360
You'll get it back, after the shower.

1061
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:03,680
Forward!

1062
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:07,960
Remember your number,
to get your clothes back!

1063
01:13:11,410 --> 01:13:14,400
Women and children, will shower together.

1064
01:13:14,530 --> 01:13:16,440
Are you hurt?

1065
01:13:26,930 --> 01:13:28,760
Thanks, Bartolomeo.

1066
01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:31,650
From now on, you have to
hide here, the whole day.

1067
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:34,200
If they see us now it's over.
We're disqualified.

1068
01:13:34,330 --> 01:13:36,000
What do I have to do?

1069
01:13:36,130 --> 01:13:38,360
You have to stay.
Vittorino, help me out.

1070
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:40,410
You have to hide here, all day.

1071
01:13:40,530 --> 01:13:44,690
Don't let anyone see you,
especially those mean guys who yell.

1072
01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:46,040
Remember.

1073
01:13:46,170 --> 01:13:47,930
Stay hidden!

1074
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:50,580
This is the hardest part.

1075
01:13:50,710 --> 01:13:55,060
If we get this right, the tank is ours.
It's worth 120 points a day.

1076
01:13:55,190 --> 01:13:57,910
I'll take you with me.
I'll hide you. You're gone.

1077
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:00,780
Who's ever seen you before?
Who are you? Where is he?

1078
01:14:00,910 --> 01:14:02,180
Got it?

1079
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:08,420
Got ya!

1080
01:14:10,190 --> 01:14:11,510
Good boy!

1081
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,790
Anybody here? Am I disturbing?

1082
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:37,640
Come here!

1083
01:15:37,770 --> 01:15:39,640
Quick as lightning!

1084
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:47,050
Good morning, Princess!

1085
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:51,050
Last night, I dreamt
about you all night!

1086
01:15:51,170 --> 01:15:55,320
We were going to the movies.
You were wearing that pink suit...

1087
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:57,010
that I really like.

1088
01:15:57,130 --> 01:15:59,360
You're all I think about, Princess.

1089
01:15:59,490 --> 01:16:01,960
I always think about you. And now...

1090
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:03,520
Mommy!

1091
01:16:03,650 --> 01:16:07,490
Pop wheels me in the wheelbarrow,
but he doesn't know, how to drive!

1092
01:16:07,610 --> 01:16:08,960
We laugh like crazy!

1093
01:16:09,090 --> 01:16:12,720
We're in the lead! How many
points do we have today?

1094
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:16,080
Run! The mean guys,
who yell, are behind us!

1095
01:16:16,090 --> 01:16:18,450
- Where?
- Over here! Come on!

1096
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:33,450
Are they dry?

1097
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:36,650
They're dry.

1098
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:38,410
Catch.

1099
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:40,050
Get dressed.

1100
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:57,130
What happened to Vittorino,
Alfonso and the others?

1101
01:16:57,260 --> 01:16:59,460
They didn't make it.

1102
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:53,060
"If you say my name,
I'm not there anymore."

1103
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:54,420
Silence.

1104
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,830
Thank goodness. I was getting scared.
What happened to you?

1105
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,080
They're half crazy!

1106
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:35,550
The man who does the
check-ups, the Captain...

1107
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:38,350
He's a friend of mine.
I met him when I was a waiter.

1108
01:18:38,490 --> 01:18:42,440
He said they're having a dinner with
all the officials and their wives.

1109
01:18:42,570 --> 01:18:45,840
He asked me if I wanted to
wait tables, at the dinner.

1110
01:18:45,970 --> 01:18:49,680
Maybe he wants to help me.
He might get us out of here.

1111
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:57,880
Have you seen Joshua?

1112
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,800
What do you mean, no?

1113
01:19:06,890 --> 01:19:08,840
What are you doing? Come here!

1114
01:19:08,970 --> 01:19:13,020
- No.
- I told you to come.

1115
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:14,620
No? Come on out!

1116
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:18,010
Come out! Look here. You're all dirty.

1117
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:20,330
Where have you been?

1118
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:23,930
I had to finish playing rummy.

1119
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:27,890
They make buttons and soap out of us.

1120
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:33,540
- What are you saying?
- They burn us all in the oven.

1121
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:36,770
Who told you that?

1122
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:41,500
A man was crying. He said they
make buttons and soap out of us.

1123
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:46,090
You fell for that?

1124
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:48,290
Again?

1125
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:51,580
I thought you were a sharp boy...
cunning, intelligent.

1126
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:55,460
Buttons and soap out of people?
That'll be the day!

1127
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:57,940
You believed that?

1128
01:19:58,780 --> 01:20:02,660
Just imagine. Tomorrow morning,
I wash my hands with Bartolomeo...

1129
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:04,340
a good scrub.

1130
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:07,100
Then I'll button up with Francesco.

1131
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:08,370
Darn it all!

1132
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,940
Look! I just lost Giorgio!

1133
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:13,220
Does this look like a person?

1134
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:16,220
Come on! They were teasing you!
And you fell for it!

1135
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:18,460
What else did they tell you?

1136
01:20:18,590 --> 01:20:20,380
That we get cooked in the oven.

1137
01:20:24,270 --> 01:20:26,140
They burn us up in the oven.

1138
01:20:29,710 --> 01:20:32,660
You fell for that too!
You just eat everything up!

1139
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:34,940
I've heard of a wood oven...

1140
01:20:35,070 --> 01:20:36,980
but I've never seen a man oven before.

1141
01:20:37,910 --> 01:20:41,510
"I'm made of wood!" - "Take this lawyer!"

1142
01:20:41,630 --> 01:20:43,980
"This lawyer doesn't burn.
He's not dry enough.

1143
01:20:44,110 --> 01:20:45,670
Look at that smoke!"

1144
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:49,830
Buttons, soap, we get
burned in the oven.

1145
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:51,910
Let's be serious now.

1146
01:20:52,030 --> 01:20:54,670
I have a bag race,
with the bad guys tomorrow.

1147
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:58,160
That's enough. I want to go home.

1148
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:02,470
- Now?
- Right now.

1149
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,680
It's raining now. You'll come
down with a terrible fever!

1150
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,560
I don't care. Let's go.

1151
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:11,230
All right. If you want to go...

1152
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,280
I'll get our stuff and we'll leave.

1153
01:21:15,530 --> 01:21:17,680
- We can leave?
- Naturally.

1154
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:20,160
What do you think they do,
force people to stay here?

1155
01:21:20,290 --> 01:21:22,200
That'll be the day.

1156
01:21:22,330 --> 01:21:24,050
Wouldn't that be great? Let's go.

1157
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,210
We'll pack our bags...

1158
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:27,840
and get out of here.

1159
01:21:27,970 --> 01:21:31,560
What a shame. We were in the lead.
We're quitting. Off the list we go.

1160
01:21:31,690 --> 01:21:34,560
Some other kid, will win the real tank.

1161
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:37,520
There aren't any other kids.
I'm the only one left.

1162
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:40,720
There aren't any more kids?
It's chock-full of them here!

1163
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:42,280
Where are they then?

1164
01:21:42,410 --> 01:21:45,050
They're all hiding.
Nobody's supposed to see them.

1165
01:21:45,170 --> 01:21:48,950
- This is a serious game!
- I just don't get it.

1166
01:21:49,090 --> 01:21:50,970
How many points do we have?

1167
01:21:51,090 --> 01:21:53,080
Almost 687.

1168
01:21:53,210 --> 01:21:55,090
I told you a thousand times.

1169
01:21:55,890 --> 01:21:57,240
Let's go, though.

1170
01:21:57,370 --> 01:22:00,200
- We're winning, but if you want...
- We're winning?

1171
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:04,560
We're first, I told you.
But we'll quit if you want.

1172
01:22:05,410 --> 01:22:08,250
I saw the chart yesterday.
We'll go anyway, though.

1173
01:22:08,370 --> 01:22:10,170
Bye, Bartolomeo.
Joshua and I are leaving.

1174
01:22:10,290 --> 01:22:12,010
We're fed up here.

1175
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:16,080
The tank is done. It's ready.

1176
01:22:16,210 --> 01:22:18,970
Clean the spark plugs off,
before you start it.

1177
01:22:19,090 --> 01:22:21,660
Open the throttle...

1178
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:24,730
otherwise the cannon will
get stuck, with the tracks.

1179
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:27,430
And the gun. Did you see how nice it is?

1180
01:22:27,470 --> 01:22:28,850
It came out beautiful!

1181
01:22:28,970 --> 01:22:32,570
Lift the emergency brake off,
before you move! We're going.

1182
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:34,650
Joshua wants to quit.

1183
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:38,090
We could have gone back with a tank
soon, but we'll take the bus today.

1184
01:22:38,220 --> 01:22:40,410
Joshua and I are leaving.
So long, everybody!

1185
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:42,330
We're tired of this place.

1186
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:45,050
Let's go or we'll miss the bus.

1187
01:22:50,710 --> 01:22:52,060
Let's go, Joshua.

1188
01:22:55,390 --> 01:22:58,980
It's raining. I'll come
down with a terrible fever!

1189
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,710
It's me, Pop!

1190
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:11,830
I have to tell you something
important! Come here!

1191
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:14,520
That little rascal's, been
running away all morning.

1192
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:17,200
- Is there really a kid?
- There must be two thousand!

1193
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:19,310
They're like mice.
They hide all over the place!

1194
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:22,080
Those creeps want our tank! Stop!

1195
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:23,520
Wait.

1196
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:27,150
I might have spotted him.

1197
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,590
I think he's nearby.

1198
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:33,570
Look. Go see if he's hiding
in there. I'll wait here.

1199
01:24:33,690 --> 01:24:35,600
I'll keep a watch out.

1200
01:24:41,890 --> 01:24:43,450
He's there, Pop!

1201
01:24:43,570 --> 01:24:45,560
- What'd he look like? Blond?
- Yes.

1202
01:24:45,690 --> 01:24:48,210
That's him then. His name is... Schwanz.

1203
01:24:48,330 --> 01:24:50,410
He's been in there for three weeks.

1204
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:52,970
He was the runner up.
We beat him, though!

1205
01:24:53,090 --> 01:24:55,810
Sooner or later,
I'll find the others too.

1206
01:24:55,940 --> 01:24:58,400
- How many are there?
- It's swarming, I told you.

1207
01:24:58,530 --> 01:25:00,130
They're all hidden.

1208
01:25:09,210 --> 01:25:12,020
- Look, Pop!
- There's a hideout!

1209
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:15,810
Got ya, got ya, got ya!
You're out! Let's go.

1210
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:26,180
- Holy smokes! She saw us!
- Are we out?

1211
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:28,610
She's coming over for you.

1212
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:30,540
Now it's time for the "be quiet" game.

1213
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:33,410
You're never to speak.

1214
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:35,170
Swear it!

1215
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:38,250
- Swear it!
- I swear.

1216
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:43,490
They all talk strange.
You can't understand a word.

1217
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:46,060
If we get through this,
the first prize is ours.

1218
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:49,060
They're rounding up everyone in
first place. It's the silence game.

1219
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:50,380
Not a word, got it?

1220
01:25:58,020 --> 01:25:59,820
Why are you here, with the children?

1221
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:01,740
Quiet! You're never to speak.

1222
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:04,340
I swear.

1223
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:01,000
I have to talk to you. Very important.

1224
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:04,000
- Where? When?
- I'll signal you. Later.

1225
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:17,920
Thank you.

1226
01:28:02,490 --> 01:28:04,840
I told you not to talk to the children.

1227
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:34,220
Doctor, my wife is here too.

1228
01:28:55,910 --> 01:28:57,310
Slowly.

1229
01:28:57,430 --> 01:28:59,870
Eat slowly. It's bad for you.

1230
01:28:59,990 --> 01:29:03,870
We're in the lead.
We just might leave early.

1231
01:29:03,990 --> 01:29:06,100
The game finishes early.

1232
01:29:06,230 --> 01:29:09,060
Don't make a mistake now
that we're in the lead.

1233
01:29:09,190 --> 01:29:10,510
Slowly.

1234
01:29:31,870 --> 01:29:33,670
So. Pay attention.

1235
01:29:39,190 --> 01:29:42,950
"Fat, fat, ugly, ugly,
all yellow in reality.

1236
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:46,590
If you ask me what I am...

1237
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:49,310
I answer, 'Cheep, cheep, cheep'.

1238
01:29:54,850 --> 01:29:58,200
Walking along I go, 'Poopoo'.

1239
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,710
Who am I? Tell me true."

1240
01:30:05,050 --> 01:30:06,770
A duckling, right?

1241
01:30:09,770 --> 01:30:11,570
Is it a duckling?

1242
01:30:13,130 --> 01:30:15,570
It's not!

1243
01:30:16,570 --> 01:30:19,720
A veterinarian friend of mine
sent it to me from Vienna.

1244
01:30:19,850 --> 01:30:22,200
I can't send him mine...

1245
01:30:22,330 --> 01:30:24,680
until I solve this one.

1246
01:30:25,770 --> 01:30:27,720
I thought...

1247
01:30:27,850 --> 01:30:29,970
duck-billed platypus...

1248
01:30:30,090 --> 01:30:32,000
but it doesn't go,
"Cheep, cheep, cheep".

1249
01:30:32,130 --> 01:30:34,330
A duck-billed platypus goes...

1250
01:30:39,850 --> 01:30:43,400
I translated it into
Italian, for you last night.

1251
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:47,130
Well, what do you say?

1252
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:51,570
Everything points, to a duckling.

1253
01:30:53,780 --> 01:30:55,410
Help me.

1254
01:30:58,930 --> 01:31:00,930
For heaven's sake...

1255
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:03,090
help me.

1256
01:31:03,210 --> 01:31:05,330
I can't even sleep.

1257
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:23,770
It's the duckling!

1258
01:33:43,570 --> 01:33:45,220
Come here!

1259
01:33:47,410 --> 01:33:49,940
- I'm tired.
- Come here.

1260
01:33:55,740 --> 01:33:57,530
Where are we here?

1261
01:33:57,660 --> 01:34:00,380
I might have taken the wrong way.

1262
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:03,460
Good boy, sleep. Dream sweet dreams.

1263
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:05,810
Maybe it's only a dream!

1264
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:07,930
We're dreaming, Joshua.

1265
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:10,450
Tomorrow morning Mommy
will come wake us up...

1266
01:34:10,580 --> 01:34:14,650
and bring us two nice
cups of milk and cookies.

1267
01:34:14,780 --> 01:34:16,780
First, we'll eat.

1268
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:19,700
Then I'll make love to her,
two or three times...

1269
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:22,020
if I can.

1270
01:35:09,190 --> 01:35:11,230
Excuse me, Bartolomeo.

1271
01:35:11,350 --> 01:35:13,780
They've called those
two officers, 20 times.

1272
01:35:13,820 --> 01:35:14,780
I bet they escaped.

1273
01:35:14,910 --> 01:35:18,990
- Did you understand anything else?
- It's clear enough.

1274
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:19,870
The war is over.

1275
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:21,640
They're running all over the place.

1276
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:24,120
Where are those trucks going?

1277
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:26,880
The important thing is not,
to get on those trucks.

1278
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,070
They leave full and come back empty.

1279
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:31,000
You know where they're going?

1280
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:34,640
What about the women? What's going on?

1281
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:37,520
Let's get out of this dump and split up.

1282
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:39,680
We don't even have to pack our bags!

1283
01:35:39,810 --> 01:35:42,270
I've been hearing only
dogs and machine guns.

1284
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:45,470
- They want to get rid of everything.
- I'm leaving.

1285
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:48,960
See you in Viareggio.
We'll start an anvil factory!

1286
01:35:49,090 --> 01:35:50,410
So long, guys. I'm leaving.

1287
01:36:07,210 --> 01:36:08,800
Come see.

1288
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:11,520
Look how mad they are! Furious!

1289
01:36:12,810 --> 01:36:15,000
You see? They're looking for you.

1290
01:36:15,130 --> 01:36:17,120
Just for you. All this is over you!

1291
01:36:17,250 --> 01:36:19,160
You're the last one!
The last one to find!

1292
01:36:19,290 --> 01:36:22,360
They're even looking under the rocks!

1293
01:36:22,490 --> 01:36:25,130
The game is over tomorrow.
They'll give the award.

1294
01:36:25,250 --> 01:36:28,370
If they don't find you tonight,
it's worth 60 points!

1295
01:36:28,490 --> 01:36:30,160
How many points do we have?

1296
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:33,210
We've got 940 points. Plus 60?

1297
01:36:33,330 --> 01:36:35,480
- A thousand!
- First place! We win!

1298
01:36:35,610 --> 01:36:37,920
They're looking all over for you.

1299
01:36:38,050 --> 01:36:40,280
No mistakes tonight. This is it!

1300
01:36:40,410 --> 01:36:43,690
- Go hide in that box, quick!
- Schwanz is in there.

1301
01:36:43,810 --> 01:36:45,530
Who?

1302
01:36:45,650 --> 01:36:47,840
The blond boy.

1303
01:36:50,060 --> 01:36:52,440
They got him yesterday.
He was eliminated.

1304
01:36:52,570 --> 01:36:55,220
It's the safest place to hide.
Nobody will look.

1305
01:36:55,330 --> 01:36:58,050
Let's go, quick as lightning. Come on!

1306
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:03,260
Inside!

1307
01:37:03,390 --> 01:37:06,180
Take this blanket, in case you get cold.

1308
01:37:06,310 --> 01:37:08,420
I'll be back soon.

1309
01:37:08,550 --> 01:37:11,770
I'll put them on the wrong track.
I think I saw him over there!

1310
01:37:40,150 --> 01:37:43,380
Pop, you scared me to death!

1311
01:37:43,510 --> 01:37:45,460
Give me the blanket. Are you cold?

1312
01:37:45,590 --> 01:37:47,390
Give me your sweater then.

1313
01:37:47,510 --> 01:37:50,420
I'll throw it on a tree
and put them off track.

1314
01:37:50,550 --> 01:37:53,390
They're looking all over for you!

1315
01:37:53,510 --> 01:37:55,980
Everybody's yelling, "Where's Joshua?".

1316
01:37:56,110 --> 01:37:59,580
They're even cursing.
They're really, really mad!

1317
01:37:59,710 --> 01:38:02,870
No one will find you.
Bye, now. I'll be back later.

1318
01:38:03,830 --> 01:38:05,500
Listen...

1319
01:38:05,630 --> 01:38:08,630
if I'm really late coming back...

1320
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:10,500
don't you move.

1321
01:38:10,630 --> 01:38:13,710
Don't come out.
You're not to come out...

1322
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:17,150
until it's completely quiet...

1323
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:19,350
and nobody is in sight, just to be safe.

1324
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:20,750
Say it!

1325
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:24,020
I won't come out until nobody is around.

1326
01:38:24,150 --> 01:38:26,060
Good boy, stubborn.

1327
01:38:53,890 --> 01:38:55,240
Leave!

1328
01:38:55,370 --> 01:38:57,360
Go away, dog!

1329
01:38:57,490 --> 01:38:59,400
Go, dog!

1330
01:38:59,530 --> 01:39:00,850
Leave.

1331
01:39:13,290 --> 01:39:14,810
Good job, Ferruccio.

1332
01:39:14,930 --> 01:39:16,810
It works.

1333
01:39:40,490 --> 01:39:42,490
Is there anyone called Dora here?

1334
01:40:20,940 --> 01:40:22,900
Dora, are you here? It's Guido.

1335
01:40:23,980 --> 01:40:27,260
I know someone is hiding here.
Is there a Dora here?

1336
01:40:36,350 --> 01:40:39,150
Is there a Dora here?
She's Italian. She's my wife.

1337
01:40:39,270 --> 01:40:42,100
Yes, there's a Dora here.

1338
01:40:43,070 --> 01:40:44,870
It's me, Dora!

1339
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:48,390
It's not her! Is there another Dora?

1340
01:40:48,510 --> 01:40:50,660
Jump out of the truck,
as soon as you can!

1341
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:53,030
Get off! Jump out!

1342
01:45:58,340 --> 01:46:00,220
It's true!

1343
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:18,360
Mommy!

1344
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:32,160
This is my story.

1345
01:47:33,640 --> 01:47:36,200
This is the sacrifice my father made.

1346
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:40,640
This was his gift to me.

1347
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:43,040
- We won!
- Yes, we won!

1348
01:47:45,140 --> 01:47:48,010
A thousand points to
laugh like crazy about!

1349
01:47:49,090 --> 01:47:52,640
We came in first!
We're taking the tank home!

1350
01:47:52,770 --> 01:47:55,050
We won!
