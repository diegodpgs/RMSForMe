Three more will die, and there is
nothing you can do to save them.

354

You must accept
that this is beyond your control...

...or, by the time you realize you
made all of this possible...

...the unholy murder of five
innocent young women...

363

...and the attempted murder of a sixth.

Here, I brought you these,
all the way from Syria.

I found this:
