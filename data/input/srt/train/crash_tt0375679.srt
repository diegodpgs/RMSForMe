1
00:02:46.335 --> 00:02:48.394
It's the sense of touch.

2
00:02:49.972 --> 00:02:51.234
What?

3
00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.209
Any real city, you walk, you know?

4
00:02:57.313 --> 00:03:01.079
You brush past people.
People bump into you.

5
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.242
In L.A., nobody touches you.

6
00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.254
We're always behind
this metal and glass.

7
00:03:11.727 --> 00:03:14.628
I think we miss
that touch so much

8
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.689
that we crash into each other
just so we can feel something.

9
00:03:20.736 --> 00:03:22.897
You guys okay?

10
00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:25.098
I think he hit his head.

11
00:03:26.008 --> 00:03:27.976
You don't think that's true?

12
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.010
Stay in your car.

13
00:03:30.112 --> 00:03:32.910
Graham, I think
we got rear-ended.

14
00:03:33.015 --> 00:03:35.074
I think we spun around twice.

15
00:03:35.184 --> 00:03:40.144
And somewhere in there,
one of us lost our frame of reference.

16
00:03:40.256 --> 00:03:42.656
And I'm gonna go look for it.

17
00:03:44.694 --> 00:03:47.492
- Calm down, ma'am.
- I am calm!

18
00:03:47.597 --> 00:03:49.690
I need to see your registration
and insurance.

19
00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.734
Why? It's not my fault!
It's her fault! She do this!

20
00:03:52.868 --> 00:03:53.630
My fault?

21
00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.634
Ma'am, you really need
to wait in your vehicle.

22
00:03:55.738 --> 00:03:56.670
My fault?

23
00:03:56.772 --> 00:03:59.240
Stop in middle of street!
Mexicans no know how to drive.

24
00:03:59.375 --> 00:04:01.343
She "blake" too fast.

25
00:04:01.444 --> 00:04:04.140
I "blake" too fast? I "blake" too fast.

26
00:04:04.247 --> 00:04:07.307
- I'm sorry you no see my "blake" lights.
- Ma'am.

27
00:04:07.416 --> 00:04:10.852
See, I stop when I see a long line of cars
stopped in front of me.

28
00:04:10.953 --> 00:04:13.922
Maybe you see over
steering wheel, you "blake" too!

29
00:04:14.023 --> 00:04:15.012
Ma'am!

30
00:04:15.124 --> 00:04:17.388
I call immigration on you.
Look what you do my car.

31
00:04:17.493 --> 00:04:21.224
Officer, can you please write in your report how
shocked I am to be hit by an Asian driver!

32
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.424
- Ma'am!
- Ma'am, no. See, Detective...

33
00:04:29.472 --> 00:04:32.839
All right. You've got to calm down.

34
00:04:40.483 --> 00:04:42.747
Hey, Detective! Nice entrance.

35
00:04:42.852 --> 00:04:44.581
Fuck you.

36
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.624
Hey, you okay?

37
00:04:50.793 --> 00:04:51.987
I'm freezin'.

38
00:04:52.094 --> 00:04:54.858
Shit. I heard it might snow.

39
00:04:54.964 --> 00:04:57.262
- Get outta here.
- That's what I heard.

40
00:04:57.366 --> 00:05:00.062
- You got a smoke?
- Nah. I quit.

41
00:05:00.202 --> 00:05:02.864
Yeah, me too.

42
00:05:03.005 --> 00:05:05.473
- What do you got?
- Dead kid.

43
00:05:15.785 --> 00:05:17.047
Hey, Bob.

44
00:05:59.128 --> 00:06:01.961
You get one free box of ammunition.
What kind do you want?

45
00:06:14.844 --> 00:06:17.836
Yo, Osama! Plan a jihad
on your own time.

46
00:06:17.947 --> 00:06:20.541
What do you want?

47
00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:24.786
Are you making insult at me?

48
00:06:24.887 --> 00:06:27.788
Am I making insult "at" you?
Is that the closest you can come to English?

49
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.825
- Yes, I speak English! I am American citizen.
- Oh, God, here we go.

50
00:06:30.926 --> 00:06:33.292
I have right like you.
I have right to buy gun.

51
00:06:33.396 --> 00:06:35.523
Not in my store, you don't!
Andy, get him outta here now!

52
00:06:35.631 --> 00:06:37.792
- Go wait in the car.
- Now. Get out!

53
00:06:39.201 --> 00:06:40.793
You're an ignorant man!

54
00:06:40.936 --> 00:06:42.528
Yeah, I'm ignorant?
You're liberating my country.

55
00:06:42.671 --> 00:06:45.697
And I'm flying 747 s into your mud huts
and incinerating your friends?

56
00:06:45.841 --> 00:06:48.833
- Get the fuck out!
- No, you get the fuck out!

57
00:06:48.978 --> 00:06:50.605
No, don't touch me!
He cheat me!

58
00:06:50.713 --> 00:06:52.613
- Andy, now!
- Let's go.

59
00:06:52.715 --> 00:06:54.182
Okay.

60
00:06:57.787 --> 00:07:00.585
You can give me the gun
or give me back the money.

61
00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:04.750
And I am really hoping
for the money.

62
00:07:08.564 --> 00:07:11.124
- What kind of ammunition do you want?
- Whatever fits.

63
00:07:11.233 --> 00:07:13.224
We got a lot of kinds.

64
00:07:13.369 --> 00:07:15.735
We got long colts,
short colts, bull heads,

65
00:07:15.838 --> 00:07:18.363
flat nose, hollow points,
wide cutters,

66
00:07:18.507 --> 00:07:21.943
and a dozen more that'll fit
any size hole.

67
00:07:22.044 --> 00:07:25.810
Just depends upon how
much bang you can handle.

68
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.116
I'll take the ones
in the red box.

69
00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:35.789
- You know what those are?
- Can I have them?

70
00:07:45.935 --> 00:07:50.099
Did you see any white people waitin' an hour
and 32 minutes for a plate of spaghetti?

71
00:07:50.239 --> 00:07:51.672
And how many cups of coffee
did we get?

72
00:07:51.774 --> 00:07:54.709
You don't drink coffee
and I didn't want any.

73
00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:58.507
Man, that woman poured cup after cup
to every single white person around us.

74
00:07:58.614 --> 00:08:01.674
But did she even ask you
if you wanted any?

75
00:08:01.784 --> 00:08:03.752
We didn't get any coffee that you didn't want
and I didn't order,

76
00:08:03.853 --> 00:08:06.083
and that's evidence
of racial discrimination?

77
00:08:06.188 --> 00:08:08.179
Did you notice
that our waitress was black?

78
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.758
And black women don't think
in stereotypes?

79
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.294
You tell me.
When was the last time you met one

80
00:08:13.395 --> 00:08:15.659
who didn't think she knew
everything about your lazy ass

81
00:08:15.764 --> 00:08:17.629
before you even opened
your mouth, huh?

82
00:08:17.733 --> 00:08:19.997
That waitress sized us up
in two seconds.

83
00:08:20.135 --> 00:08:23.901
We're black, and black people don't tip.
She wasn't gonna waste her time.

84
00:08:24.006 --> 00:08:26.975
Somebody like that? Nothing you can do
to change their mind.

85
00:08:27.109 --> 00:08:29.543
How much did you leave?

86
00:08:29.645 --> 00:08:31.545
You expect me to pay
for that kind of service?

87
00:08:32.515 --> 00:08:36.042
What? What the fuck
is you laughin' at, man?

88
00:08:36.151 --> 00:08:39.177
I'm seriously starting to think
that you're jealous of Karen.

89
00:08:39.288 --> 00:08:43.486
Hardly. I'd just like to see you get through
a meal without calling her or anyone else.

90
00:08:43.592 --> 00:08:48.120
Okay, no more phone calls.
As a matter of fact, you can hold the battery.

91
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.061
Okay?

92
00:08:51.534 --> 00:08:53.866
Ten bucks says
she calls you in the car.

93
00:08:54.003 --> 00:08:56.665
Wait, wait, wait.
See what that woman just did?

94
00:08:56.805 --> 00:08:58.739
- You see that?
- She's cold.

95
00:08:58.874 --> 00:09:02.207
She got colder
as soon as she saw us.

96
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:05.439
- Ah, come on, don't start.
- Man, look around you, man.

97
00:09:05.548 --> 00:09:09.006
You couldn't find a whiter, safer
or better-lit part of this city right now.

98
00:09:09.118 --> 00:09:11.018
But yet this white woman
sees two black guys

99
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.816
who look like UCLA students
strolling down the sidewalk,

100
00:09:13.923 --> 00:09:16.357
and her reaction
is blind fear?

101
00:09:16.458 --> 00:09:18.949
Look at us, dawg.
Are we dressed like gangbangers?

102
00:09:19.061 --> 00:09:22.394
Huh? No.
Do we look threatening? No.

103
00:09:22.498 --> 00:09:26.400
Fact. If anybody should be
scared around here, it's us!

104
00:09:26.535 --> 00:09:30.471
We're the only two black faces surrounded by
a sea of over-caffeinated white people

105
00:09:30.606 --> 00:09:33.302
patrolled by
the trigger-happy L.A.P.D.

106
00:09:33.409 --> 00:09:36.970
So you tell me.
Why aren't we scared?

107
00:09:37.079 --> 00:09:39.274
'Cause we got guns?

108
00:09:39.381 --> 00:09:41.281
You could be right.

109
00:09:44.253 --> 00:09:46.483
- Get the fuck outta the car!
- Gimme the keys!

110
00:09:46.589 --> 00:09:49.319
- Hurry up! Get down!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

111
00:09:49.425 --> 00:09:53.657
- No, no! Please!
- Don't look at me! Turn around!

112
00:09:53.762 --> 00:09:57.289
- Come on! Go!
- We're fine! Just keep moving!

113
00:10:02.504 --> 00:10:06.941
No, no, no! Take that voodoo-assed thing
off of there right now.

114
00:10:07.076 --> 00:10:09.374
I know you just didn't call
Saint Christopher voodoo.

115
00:10:09.478 --> 00:10:11.343
Man's the patron saint
of travelers, dawg.

116
00:10:11.447 --> 00:10:14.314
You had a conversation
with God, huh? What did God say?

117
00:10:14.416 --> 00:10:18.910
"Go forth, my son, and leave big slobbery
suction rings on every dashboard you find"?

118
00:10:19.021 --> 00:10:20.113
Why the hell do you do that?

119
00:10:20.222 --> 00:10:23.089
Look at the way your crazy ass drive,
then ask me again.

120
00:10:30.833 --> 00:10:33.358
Chevy pickup and Mercedes
driving north on Balboa.

121
00:10:33.502 --> 00:10:36.164
Pickup cuts in front. Driver of the Mercedes
gets pissed, pulls a gun.

122
00:10:36.305 --> 00:10:38.967
Doesn't realize the guy in the pickup
is a cop coming off shift.

123
00:10:39.108 --> 00:10:40.973
This Barry Gibb dude is a cop?

124
00:10:41.076 --> 00:10:43.510
Yeah. Name's Conklin.
He's a narc out of Wilshire.

125
00:10:43.612 --> 00:10:45.477
I got the Mercedes.

126
00:10:46.382 --> 00:10:50.011
Mercedes takes a shot at him.
Detective Conklin returns fire. One shot.

127
00:10:50.119 --> 00:10:53.680
Mercedes rolls to a stop. Driver opens the
door, falls out dead.

128
00:10:53.789 --> 00:10:56.587
He looks very relaxed
for just having shot somebody.

129
00:10:56.692 --> 00:10:58.489
He says he kept tryin'
to drive away.

130
00:10:58.594 --> 00:11:00.653
The Mercedes kept pulling up next to him,
screaming, waving a gun.

131
00:11:00.763 --> 00:11:03.357
Shot back in self-defense.

132
00:11:03.465 --> 00:11:07.663
- Anybody actually see who shot first?
- They just heard two bangs.

133
00:11:07.803 --> 00:11:09.634
Find me a witness.

134
00:11:23.819 --> 00:11:26.583
That is a nice gun.

135
00:11:26.689 --> 00:11:31.251
The car's registered
to a Cindy Bradley.

136
00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.225
And that's not Cindy.

137
00:11:33.328 --> 00:11:36.126
That is a William Lewis.

138
00:11:36.231 --> 00:11:39.200
Found under the front seat.
Hollywood Division.

139
00:11:43.706 --> 00:11:47.642
Looks like Detective Conklin
shot himself the wrong nigger.

140
00:11:59.188 --> 00:12:02.316
- How much longer are you gonna be?
- This is the last one.

141
00:12:02.424 --> 00:12:03.413
Thank you.

142
00:12:13.102 --> 00:12:15.468
You don't think reporters listen to police calls?

143
00:12:15.571 --> 00:12:17.368
I need to talk to you
for a second.

144
00:12:19.241 --> 00:12:21.709
You just give me a minute,
all right?

145
00:12:21.844 --> 00:12:24.677
- Find Flanagan, will you? Now.
- Yes, sir.

146
00:12:26.515 --> 00:12:27.504
Yes, honey?

147
00:12:27.616 --> 00:12:29.447
I want the locks changed again in the morning.

148
00:12:29.551 --> 00:12:33.282
You want... Why don't you just go lie down?
Have you checked on James?

149
00:12:33.388 --> 00:12:36.323
Of course. I've checked on him every five
minutes since we've been home.

150
00:12:36.425 --> 00:12:40.657
Do not patronize me. I want the locks
changed again in the morning.

151
00:12:41.463 --> 00:12:44.057
It's okay.
Just go to bed.

152
00:12:44.166 --> 00:12:47.658
You know, didn't I just ask you
not to treat me like a child?

153
00:12:47.803 --> 00:12:51.864
I'm sorry, Miss Jean.
Is okay I go home now?

154
00:12:52.007 --> 00:12:53.497
It's fine. Thank you
very much for staying.

155
00:12:53.642 --> 00:12:55.269
You're welcome. No problem.
Good night.

156
00:12:55.377 --> 00:12:58.141
- Good night.
- We'll see you tomorrow.

157
00:12:58.247 --> 00:13:02.343
I would like the locks
changed again in the morning.

158
00:13:02.451 --> 00:13:04.783
And you might mention
that we'd appreciate it

159
00:13:04.887 --> 00:13:07.082
if next time they didn't send
a gang member.

160
00:13:07.189 --> 00:13:09.487
- A gang member? You mean that kid in there?
- Yes, yes.

161
00:13:09.591 --> 00:13:13.288
Yes. The guy with the shaved head,
the pants around his ass, the prison tattoo.

162
00:13:13.395 --> 00:13:14.623
- Those are not prison tattoos.
- Oh, really?

163
00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:17.028
And he's not gonna sell our key
to one of his gangbanger friends

164
00:13:17.132 --> 00:13:19.498
- the moment he is out our door?
- We've had a tough night.

165
00:13:19.635 --> 00:13:23.298
- It'd be best if you went upstairs...
- And wait for them to break in?

166
00:13:23.438 --> 00:13:26.874
I just had a gun pointed in my face.

167
00:13:27.009 --> 00:13:27.976
You lower your voice!

168
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:30.977
And it was my fault
because I knew it was gonna happen.

169
00:13:31.079 --> 00:13:33.570
But if a white person sees two black men
walking towards her,

170
00:13:33.682 --> 00:13:37.243
and she turns and walks in the other direction,
she's a racist, right?

171
00:13:37.352 --> 00:13:39.946
Well, I got scared
and I didn't say anything.

172
00:13:40.055 --> 00:13:42.319
And ten seconds later
I had a gun in my face!

173
00:13:42.424 --> 00:13:46.622
I am telling you. Your amigo in there is gonna
sell our key to one of his homies.

174
00:13:46.728 --> 00:13:51.222
And this time it'd be really fucking great
if you acted like you actually gave a shit!

175
00:14:19.161 --> 00:14:21.356
All right, what have we got?
Talk to me, Karen.

176
00:14:21.463 --> 00:14:23.397
Flanagan doesn't think
anybody has the story yet.

177
00:14:23.498 --> 00:14:25.898
I'm the goddamn
District Attorney of Los Angeles.

178
00:14:26.034 --> 00:14:29.197
If my car gets jacked,
it's gonna make news.

179
00:14:29.338 --> 00:14:31.135
Fuck!

180
00:14:32.341 --> 00:14:34.605
Why did these guys
have to be black?

181
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:36.371
I mean, why?

182
00:14:36.478 --> 00:14:38.139
No matter how we spin this,

183
00:14:38.247 --> 00:14:41.307
I'm either gonna lose the black vote
or I'm gonna lose the law-and-order vote.

184
00:14:41.416 --> 00:14:44.977
You're worrying too much. You have
a lot of support in the black community.

185
00:14:46.688 --> 00:14:49.213
All right. If we can't duck this thing,
we're gonna have to neutralize it.

186
00:14:49.324 --> 00:14:53.886
What we need is a picture of me
pinning a medal on a black man.

187
00:14:53.996 --> 00:14:55.827
Bruce?

188
00:14:57.099 --> 00:14:58.726
The firefighter.

189
00:14:58.867 --> 00:15:01.802
The one who saved the camp or something.
Northridge. What's his name?

190
00:15:01.904 --> 00:15:03.030
He's Iraqi.

191
00:15:04.039 --> 00:15:07.236
He's Iraqi?
Well, he looks black.

192
00:15:07.342 --> 00:15:11.142
He's dark-skinned, sir, but he's Iraqi.
His name's Saddam Khahum.

193
00:15:11.246 --> 00:15:14.238
Saddam?
His-His name's Saddam?

194
00:15:14.349 --> 00:15:18.445
That's real good, Bruce. I'm gonna pin a medal
on an Iraqi named Saddam.

195
00:15:18.553 --> 00:15:20.748
Give yourself a raise, will you?

196
00:15:23.759 --> 00:15:26.489
It's been good
doing business with you.

197
00:15:27.362 --> 00:15:30.729
- How soon can I have them?
- I'm picking them up right now.

198
00:15:30.832 --> 00:15:34.461
Look, you're not listening to me.
This is an emergency.

199
00:15:34.603 --> 00:15:37.470
I keep telling you he's in pain.
He can't sleep.

200
00:15:37.572 --> 00:15:41.474
Mr. Ryan, your father has been to the clinic
three times in the last month.

201
00:15:41.576 --> 00:15:46.878
He is being treated for a urinary tract infection.
That is by no means an emergency.

202
00:15:46.982 --> 00:15:51.112
If you have any more questions
about your HMO plan, why don't you

203
00:15:51.219 --> 00:15:54.780
make an appointment to come in between
10:00 and 4:00, Monday through Friday.

204
00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:56.949
What does my father do
about sleeping tonight?

205
00:15:57.025 --> 00:15:58.856
I don't know.
I'm not a doctor.

206
00:15:58.927 --> 00:16:01.760
- I wanna talk to your supervisor.
- I am my supervisor!

207
00:16:01.863 --> 00:16:03.763
- What is your name?
- Shaniqua Johnson.

208
00:16:03.865 --> 00:16:06.561
Shaniqua.
Big fucking surprise that is.

209
00:16:22.884 --> 00:16:25.250
<i>Bronson Avenue, Westwood</i>.

210
00:16:25.354 --> 00:16:28.050
<i>Vehicle is described as a black</i>
<i>late-model Lincoln Navigator</i>.

211
00:16:28.156 --> 00:16:32.684
<i>California plate</i>
<i>4 Peter Charles Ida 315</i>.

212
00:16:32.794 --> 00:16:36.230
<i>Suspects are two black males,</i>
<i>approximately 20 years of age</i>.

213
00:16:44.639 --> 00:16:45.663
That's not it.

214
00:16:46.908 --> 00:16:48.842
That's not the vehicle, John.
The plates don't match.

215
00:16:48.944 --> 00:16:52.675
The driver's gotta be 40. Nobody jacks a car
and takes it to Studio City.

216
00:16:57.753 --> 00:17:00.051
They were doin' something.

217
00:17:44.366 --> 00:17:45.765
Enthusiastic.

218
00:17:47.002 --> 00:17:49.129
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em, please.

219
00:17:49.271 --> 00:17:53.503
I'm gonna need to see
your driver's license and registration.

220
00:17:53.608 --> 00:17:55.769
No problem.

221
00:17:55.877 --> 00:17:59.745
I'm gonna have to reach inside the glove
compartment to get the registration.

222
00:17:59.848 --> 00:18:02.214
- Is that okay?
- Nice and slow, please.

223
00:18:02.317 --> 00:18:03.682
Okay.

224
00:18:07.823 --> 00:18:10.018
How are you tonight, Officer?

225
00:18:10.125 --> 00:18:12.025
Excellent.

226
00:18:13.829 --> 00:18:15.558
Here you go.

227
00:18:18.867 --> 00:18:20.926
Stay inside the vehicle, please.

228
00:18:30.345 --> 00:18:32.404
Let's do it again right now.

229
00:18:33.248 --> 00:18:35.273
Step outta the car, please, sir.

230
00:18:35.383 --> 00:18:39.080
Wait a minute, Officer.
I haven't been drinking or anything.

231
00:18:39.187 --> 00:18:41.417
Then we shouldn't have a problem.

232
00:18:41.523 --> 00:18:44.117
He doesn't drink.
He's a Buddhist, for Christ's sake.

233
00:18:44.226 --> 00:18:46.126
No, it's okay.

234
00:18:46.228 --> 00:18:47.718
It's fine.

235
00:18:52.801 --> 00:18:54.792
Step onto the sidewalk, sir.

236
00:18:56.404 --> 00:18:58.599
That's good. Right there.

237
00:19:00.342 --> 00:19:01.866
Look at me.

238
00:19:02.777 --> 00:19:04.711
I want you to stand
on your right foot.

239
00:19:04.813 --> 00:19:08.977
Touch your nose
with the index finger of your left hand.

240
00:19:13.355 --> 00:19:15.380
I told you he doesn't drink.

241
00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:18.687
Ma'am, I'm only gonna tell you
one time to stay in the vehicle.

242
00:19:18.793 --> 00:19:21.387
- Ma'am?
- Honey, honey, I'm okay. I got this.

243
00:19:21.496 --> 00:19:24.863
Don't you "ma'am" me. Who the hell
do you think you're talking to?

244
00:19:24.966 --> 00:19:28.163
Look, Officer, my wife
has had a couple of drinks...

245
00:19:28.303 --> 00:19:31.272
Both of you, turn around. Put your hands on
top of your head and interlock your fingers.

246
00:19:31.373 --> 00:19:33.170
Wait. We're only a block away from our house.

247
00:19:33.275 --> 00:19:35.675
Hands on your head.
Interlock your fingers.

248
00:19:35.777 --> 00:19:38.837
- Hands on your head. Interlock your fingers.
- I'm a television director.

249
00:19:38.947 --> 00:19:41.711
Me and my wife were just coming home
from an awards show.

250
00:19:41.816 --> 00:19:44.148
Take your hands off him.
He's done nothing wrong.

251
00:19:44.252 --> 00:19:46.345
Put your hands on top
of your head, ma'am.

252
00:19:46.454 --> 00:19:47.944
- Do what he says.
- Fuck you!

253
00:19:48.056 --> 00:19:49.023
Put your hands...

254
00:19:49.124 --> 00:19:51.922
And you keep
your filthy fucking hands off me!

255
00:19:52.027 --> 00:19:53.654
You motherfucking pig!

256
00:19:53.762 --> 00:19:57.289
- Just stop talking!
- That's quite a mouth you have.

257
00:19:57.399 --> 00:19:59.128
Of course you know that.

258
00:19:59.267 --> 00:20:03.067
Fuck you! That's what
this is all about, isn't it?

259
00:20:03.171 --> 00:20:05.969
You thought you saw a white woman blowin' a
black man. That drove your cracker ass crazy.

260
00:20:06.074 --> 00:20:07.803
Will you just shut
your fucking mouth!

261
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:10.969
I'd listen to your husband, ma'am.

262
00:20:11.079 --> 00:20:13.377
Put your legs open.

263
00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:19.610
Do you have any guns or knives
or anything I might get stuck with?

264
00:20:19.721 --> 00:20:22.212
I'm wearing a cocktail dress.
What do you think?

265
00:20:22.324 --> 00:20:24.451
You'd be surprised some of the places
I've found weapons.

266
00:20:24.559 --> 00:20:25.457
He's clean.

267
00:20:26.995 --> 00:20:30.863
What do you think we should do about this,
Mr. Thayer?

268
00:20:31.733 --> 00:20:35.066
My partner and I just witnessed your wife
performing fellatio on you

269
00:20:35.203 --> 00:20:37.330
while you were operating
a motor vehicle.

270
00:20:37.472 --> 00:20:41.568
That's reckless endangerment,
which incidentally is a felony.

271
00:20:43.578 --> 00:20:48.174
We could charge your wife with lewd conduct
and performing a sexual act in public.

272
00:20:50.418 --> 00:20:53.148
You say you're a block from home.

273
00:20:53.255 --> 00:20:55.621
We could use our discretion

274
00:20:55.724 --> 00:20:57.749
and let you go with a warning,

275
00:20:58.693 --> 00:21:01.127
or we could cuff you and put you
in the back of the car.

276
00:21:03.898 --> 00:21:06.833
What do you think
we should do, sir?

277
00:21:14.342 --> 00:21:17.573
Look, we're sorry, and

278
00:21:17.679 --> 00:21:23.208
we would appreciate if you would just
let us go with a warning, please.

279
00:21:27.822 --> 00:21:30.518
The man's apologizing, Tommy.

280
00:21:30.625 --> 00:21:33.719
I think we can let him go.
Don't you?

281
00:21:36.431 --> 00:21:37.989
Yeah.

282
00:21:38.099 --> 00:21:40.363
All right.

283
00:21:41.536 --> 00:21:43.003
You can go.

284
00:21:52.547 --> 00:21:54.845
You folks
drive safe now, huh?

285
00:22:29.084 --> 00:22:31.450
Let's go, Tommy.

286
00:22:39.594 --> 00:22:41.494
It won't close.

287
00:22:42.831 --> 00:22:43.798
I can do that.

288
00:22:43.898 --> 00:22:45.798
Dad, you couldn't even get it open.

289
00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.891
Have respect for your father.
Give me the gun!

290
00:22:49.704 --> 00:22:52.332
Here. Now you can shoot
anybody you want.

291
00:22:52.474 --> 00:22:55.238
Dorri, that man
could've killed your mother.

292
00:22:55.343 --> 00:22:58.710
You think I should let crazy people
do what they want to us?

293
00:22:58.813 --> 00:23:00.303
Farhad, it won't close.

294
00:23:04.919 --> 00:23:07.353
Dorri, you should be at work.

295
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.891
Who are you calling?

296
00:23:21.035 --> 00:23:23.629
I'm gonna report their asses.
Sons of bitches.

297
00:23:23.772 --> 00:23:27.731
You actually believe they're gonna take
anything you have to say seriously?

298
00:23:27.876 --> 00:23:32.210
Do you have any idea how that felt?
To have that pig's hands all over me?

299
00:23:32.313 --> 00:23:34.144
And you just stood there!

300
00:23:36.151 --> 00:23:37.948
And then you apologized to him?

301
00:23:38.052 --> 00:23:40.953
What did you want me to do?
Get us both shot?

302
00:23:41.055 --> 00:23:44.491
They were gonna shoot us
on Ventura Boulevard! Pathetic.

303
00:23:44.592 --> 00:23:48.358
Well, maybe you would've been satisfied
with just being arrested.

304
00:23:48.463 --> 00:23:52.331
Oh, I get it. Much better to let him
shove his hand up my crotch

305
00:23:52.467 --> 00:23:55.231
than get your name in the paper.

306
00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:57.463
You finally got me
figured out, 'cause see,

307
00:23:57.605 --> 00:24:00.369
that's exactly
what I was worried about right there.

308
00:24:00.475 --> 00:24:03.535
Oh? You weren't afraid that
all your good friends at the studio

309
00:24:03.645 --> 00:24:07.513
were gonna read about you in the morning
and realize he's actually black?

310
00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:11.175
You need to calm down right now.

311
00:24:11.286 --> 00:24:16.121
What I need is a husband who will not just
stand there while I am being molested!

312
00:24:16.224 --> 00:24:19.193
They were cops for God sakes!
They had guns!

313
00:24:20.862 --> 00:24:23.592
Maybe I should've let them
arrest your ass.

314
00:24:23.698 --> 00:24:27.429
Sooner or later you gotta find out
what it is really like to be black.

315
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:30.335
Fuck you, man.
Like you know.

316
00:24:30.438 --> 00:24:34.135
The closest you ever came to being black,
Cameron, was watching <i>The Cosby Show</i>.

317
00:24:34.242 --> 00:24:37.336
At least I wasn't watching it
with the rest of the equestrian team.

318
00:24:37.445 --> 00:24:39.606
You're right, Cameron.
I got a lot to learn

319
00:24:39.714 --> 00:24:42.808
'cause I haven't quite learned
how to shuck and jive.

320
00:24:42.917 --> 00:24:45.784
Let me hear it again.
Thank you, mister policeman.

321
00:24:45.887 --> 00:24:48.617
You sure is mighty kind
to us poor black folk.

322
00:24:48.723 --> 00:24:53.251
You be sure to let me know next time
you wanna finger-fuck my wife.

323
00:24:54.796 --> 00:24:57.697
How the fuck do you say
something like that to me?

324
00:24:58.833 --> 00:25:00.027
You know, fuck you!

325
00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:05.765
That's good. A little anger.
It's a bit late, but it's nice to see!

326
00:25:55.623 --> 00:25:56.681
How's it goin'?

327
00:25:56.791 --> 00:25:58.452
Okay.

328
00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.687
You didn't get scared
or something, did you?

329
00:26:00.795 --> 00:26:03.559
There's no monsters in the closet, right?
'Cause I hate monsters.

330
00:26:03.665 --> 00:26:06.657
There's no such thing
as monsters.

331
00:26:06.768 --> 00:26:08.759
Ah, that's a good thing.

332
00:26:08.903 --> 00:26:10.370
I heard a bang.

333
00:26:10.471 --> 00:26:12.063
Like a truck bang?

334
00:26:12.206 --> 00:26:14.265
Like a gun.

335
00:26:21.549 --> 00:26:25.383
That's funny, 'cause we moved
outta that bad neighborhood.

336
00:26:25.486 --> 00:26:28.284
And there's not
too many guns around here.

337
00:26:29.691 --> 00:26:32.057
How far can bullets go?

338
00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:34.128
They go pretty far.

339
00:26:34.228 --> 00:26:37.026
But they usually get stuck
in something and stop.

340
00:26:37.131 --> 00:26:38.792
What if they don't?

341
00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:42.666
You thinking about that bullet
that came through your window?

342
00:26:45.373 --> 00:26:47.432
You think we should move again?

343
00:26:47.575 --> 00:26:48.974
I like it here.

344
00:26:49.077 --> 00:26:51.068
Me too. But if that bullet
found out where we lived...

345
00:26:52.714 --> 00:26:53.703
Oh, hold on.

346
00:26:53.815 --> 00:26:55.305
What?

347
00:26:55.416 --> 00:26:57.441
So stupid!
How can I forget this?

348
00:26:58.853 --> 00:26:59.820
What?

349
00:27:02.023 --> 00:27:03.684
Nah. Forget it.
You ain't gonna believe me.

350
00:27:03.791 --> 00:27:05.349
Tell me.

351
00:27:06.227 --> 00:27:08.661
Okay.

352
00:27:08.763 --> 00:27:12.426
When I was five, this fairy
came into my room one night.

353
00:27:12.533 --> 00:27:15.161
- Right.
- See, I told you you weren't gonna believe me.

354
00:27:15.303 --> 00:27:17.737
- Okay, go to sleep now, you little rat.
- No, tell me.

355
00:27:19.874 --> 00:27:22.138
Okay.

356
00:27:22.243 --> 00:27:27.510
So this fairy comes into my room and I'm like,
"Yeah, right, you're a fairy. "

357
00:27:27.615 --> 00:27:29.640
Anyway, we're talking, you know.

358
00:27:29.751 --> 00:27:32.845
And she's flying all around the room,
knocking down all my posters and stuff.

359
00:27:32.954 --> 00:27:35.320
She was flying?

360
00:27:35.423 --> 00:27:38.051
She had these little stubby wings.
She could've glued 'em on, you know?

361
00:27:38.159 --> 00:27:40.787
Like I'm gonna believe
she's a fairy.

362
00:27:40.895 --> 00:27:42.863
So she said, "I'll prove it. "

363
00:27:42.964 --> 00:27:45.558
So she reaches
into her backpack.

364
00:27:45.667 --> 00:27:47.931
And she pulls out
this invisible cloak.

365
00:27:48.069 --> 00:27:52.631
She ties it around my neck, and she tells me
that it's impenetrable.

366
00:27:52.774 --> 00:27:55.004
You know what
impenetrable means?

367
00:27:55.109 --> 00:27:56.974
It means that nothing
can go through it.

368
00:27:57.011 --> 00:27:59.275
No bullets. Nothing.

369
00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:03.248
She told me that if I wore it,
nothing would hurt me.

370
00:28:03.351 --> 00:28:08.311
So I did. And my whole life,
I never got shot, stabbed.

371
00:28:08.423 --> 00:28:11.358
Nothing.
I mean, how weird is that?

372
00:28:11.459 --> 00:28:15.418
Only she told me that I was supposed to give it
to my daughter on her fifth birthday.

373
00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:17.293
And I forgot.

374
00:28:17.398 --> 00:28:18.888
Can I touch it?

375
00:28:19.033 --> 00:28:21.058
Sure, go ahead.

376
00:28:23.471 --> 00:28:26.463
- I don't feel it.
- Yeah. It's pretty cool, huh?

377
00:28:26.607 --> 00:28:30.475
I can take it off and tie it around your
shoulders. She told me how to do it.

378
00:28:30.578 --> 00:28:34.207
- Unless you think it's stupid.
- Don't you need it?

379
00:28:34.315 --> 00:28:37.113
No, not anymore.

380
00:28:37.218 --> 00:28:40.153
So what do you think?
You want it?

381
00:28:46.427 --> 00:28:48.156
Okay, let's get outta here.

382
00:28:53.901 --> 00:28:54.868
Okay.

383
00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:11.512
Put your head up.

384
00:29:16.491 --> 00:29:19.187
Okay. Is that too tight?

385
00:29:19.293 --> 00:29:21.761
Do you feel anything at all?

386
00:29:21.863 --> 00:29:24.263
Good. Then it's just right.

387
00:29:30.571 --> 00:29:33.039
Do I take it off
when I have a bath?

388
00:29:33.174 --> 00:29:35.938
No, you leave it on
all the time.

389
00:29:36.043 --> 00:29:41.413
Until you have a daughter when she turns five,
then you give it to her.

390
00:29:41.516 --> 00:29:42.813
Okay?

391
00:29:43.684 --> 00:29:44.651
Okay.

392
00:29:47.088 --> 00:29:50.524
Okay. Good night, sweetie.

393
00:29:51.726 --> 00:29:54.251
Good night.

394
00:30:33.601 --> 00:30:37.002
Nah, nah. You wanna listen to music
of the oppressor, you go right ahead, man.

395
00:30:37.939 --> 00:30:41.170
How in the lunacy of your mind
is hip-hop music of the oppressor?

396
00:30:41.275 --> 00:30:44.540
Listen to it, man!
"Nigger this, nigger that. "

397
00:30:44.645 --> 00:30:48.103
You think white people go around calling
each other honkies all day, man?

398
00:30:48.216 --> 00:30:49.649
"Hey, honky, how's business?"

399
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:51.718
"Going great, cracker.
We're diversifying. "

400
00:30:51.819 --> 00:30:56.620
How 'bout this, huh? Listen. You like that?
Man's singin' about lynchin' niggers.

401
00:30:56.724 --> 00:30:58.453
And you think
there's a difference, don't you? Huh?

402
00:30:58.559 --> 00:31:02.655
<i>Gonna buy me a rope</i>
<i>and lynch me a nigger</i>

403
00:31:02.763 --> 00:31:05.960
You have absolutely no idea where hip-hop
music comes from, do you?

404
00:31:06.067 --> 00:31:08.627
<i>I'd shoot 'em dead first</i>
<i>but I done broke my trigger</i>

405
00:31:08.769 --> 00:31:10.999
See, back in the '60s we had
smart, articulate black men.

406
00:31:11.138 --> 00:31:13.436
<i>Gonna get out my sheet</i>
<i>Put my hood on my head</i>

407
00:31:13.541 --> 00:31:16.442
Like Huey Newton, Bobby Seale,
Eldridge Cleaver, Fred Hampton.

408
00:31:16.544 --> 00:31:17.909
<i>Gonna string 'em up good</i>

409
00:31:18.012 --> 00:31:19.809
These brothers were speaking out,
and people were listening!

410
00:31:19.914 --> 00:31:21.609
<i>Then they'll be dead</i>

411
00:31:21.716 --> 00:31:23.707
Then the FBI said,
"No, we can't have that. "

412
00:31:23.818 --> 00:31:26.616
<i>Home of the brave</i>
<i>and the land of the free</i>

413
00:31:26.721 --> 00:31:28.780
"Let's give the niggers
this music by a bunch of mumbling idiots

414
00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:31.620
and sooner or later,
they'll all copy it, and nobody

415
00:31:31.726 --> 00:31:33.717
will be able to understand
a fucking word they say.

416
00:31:33.828 --> 00:31:35.989
End of problem. "

417
00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:44.301
What the fuck was that, dawg?

418
00:31:58.619 --> 00:32:00.849
- Holy shit!
- What?

419
00:32:00.955 --> 00:32:02.513
Man, we done ran over a Chinaman.

420
00:32:03.758 --> 00:32:05.487
You're sayin' there's a Chinaman
under this truck?

421
00:32:05.593 --> 00:32:06.685
What part don't you understand?

422
00:32:06.794 --> 00:32:09.627
There's a Chinaman stuck
underneath the fucking truck.

423
00:32:12.066 --> 00:32:13.033
Help me.

424
00:32:13.167 --> 00:32:15.829
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

425
00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:19.633
Ah, God. What the hell did he do,
just leap out in front of the truck?

426
00:32:20.541 --> 00:32:22.805
Man! This is so
completely fucked up.

427
00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:24.775
Oh, really? No shit!

428
00:32:24.879 --> 00:32:27.939
Okay, hold up.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

429
00:32:28.049 --> 00:32:30.017
- Get back in the truck.
- What?

430
00:32:30.117 --> 00:32:32.312
- Yes, get back in the truck.
- You think we didn't drag him far enough?

431
00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:35.287
No, we gonna drive away.
And he gonna let go.

432
00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:37.084
He's not gonna let go, Anthony.

433
00:32:37.191 --> 00:32:40.285
You know why? Because he's stuck
underneath the fucking truck!

434
00:32:40.394 --> 00:32:45.627
Now, if he could've let go, he probably would've
considered that option half a block back.

435
00:32:45.733 --> 00:32:49.191
What you and I gotta do, just grab his arms
and pull him from underneath.

436
00:32:49.337 --> 00:32:50.929
You grab his arm,
it's gonna fall off.

437
00:32:51.072 --> 00:32:53.836
Then you gonna be standing in the street
holding a Chinaman's arm.

438
00:32:53.941 --> 00:32:55.841
Then what your ass gonna do, huh?

439
00:32:56.777 --> 00:33:00.304
If we leave this man here, he dies.
Then we're up for murder charges.

440
00:33:01.315 --> 00:33:04.375
Just grab his arm.
We'll just pull him out.

441
00:33:09.557 --> 00:33:12.856
I don't wanna cause any problems, Lieutenant.
I just want a new partner.

442
00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.019
I understand. Your partner's a racist prick.

443
00:33:15.129 --> 00:33:17.563
But you don't wanna stir up
any bad feelings with him.

444
00:33:17.665 --> 00:33:19.462
He's been on the force for a long time.

445
00:33:19.567 --> 00:33:21.728
Seventeen years.

446
00:33:21.869 --> 00:33:24.064
And I do have to work here, sir.

447
00:33:24.205 --> 00:33:26.605
So you don't mind
that there's a racist prick on the force.

448
00:33:26.707 --> 00:33:29.676
You just don't want him
to ride in your car.

449
00:33:29.777 --> 00:33:32.575
If you need me to go on record
about this, sir, I will.

450
00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.477
That'd be great.
Write a full report.

451
00:33:34.582 --> 00:33:37.380
Because I'm anxious to
understand how an obvious bigot

452
00:33:37.485 --> 00:33:40.420
could've gone undetected
in this department for 17 years.

453
00:33:40.521 --> 00:33:42.682
Eleven of which he was under
my personal supervision.

454
00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:45.190
Which doesn't speak very highly
of my managerial skills.

455
00:33:45.292 --> 00:33:48.989
But that's not your concern.
I can't wait to read it.

456
00:33:49.096 --> 00:33:52.998
What if I said I wanted a new partner
for personal reasons?

457
00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:56.365
So now you're saying he's not a racist prick,
you just don't like him.

458
00:33:56.504 --> 00:33:59.371
- Yes, sir.
- That's not a good enough reason.

459
00:33:59.473 --> 00:34:02.374
Then I guess I should think of a better one
and get back to you.

460
00:34:02.476 --> 00:34:05.411
So you think I'm asking you
to make one up.

461
00:34:05.513 --> 00:34:10.280
Uh, no, sir. I just can't
think of one... right now.

462
00:34:10.384 --> 00:34:12.477
You wanna know what I heard?

463
00:34:13.921 --> 00:34:15.980
I heard it was a case
of uncontrollable flatulence.

464
00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:18.217
You want me to say
he has flatulence?

465
00:34:18.325 --> 00:34:21.089
Not him. You.
You have uncontrollable flatulence.

466
00:34:21.195 --> 00:34:24.653
You're too embarrassed to ride with anybody
else so you're requesting a one-man car.

467
00:34:24.765 --> 00:34:27.700
I'm not... comfortable with that,
Lieutenant.

468
00:34:27.835 --> 00:34:30.736
I wouldn't be either. Which is why
I understand your need for privacy.

469
00:34:30.838 --> 00:34:34.604
Just like I'm sure you understand how hard
a black man has to work to get to,

470
00:34:34.708 --> 00:34:37.836
say, where I am, in a racist fucking
organization like the L.A.P.D.

471
00:34:37.945 --> 00:34:40.971
And how easily
that can be taken away.

472
00:34:41.082 --> 00:34:44.176
Now, that being said,
it's your decision.

473
00:34:44.285 --> 00:34:49.086
You can put your career and mine on the line
in pursuit of a just cause,

474
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:53.092
or you can admit to having
an embarrassing problem

475
00:34:53.194 --> 00:34:55.492
of a personal nature.

476
00:34:58.799 --> 00:35:00.767
Fuck.

477
00:35:31.165 --> 00:35:32.132
Excuse me.

478
00:35:33.534 --> 00:35:36.094
Excuse me. Sir?

479
00:35:36.237 --> 00:35:37.465
You finished?

480
00:35:37.605 --> 00:35:41.371
I replaced the lock.
But you got a real problem with that door.

481
00:35:41.475 --> 00:35:43.943
You fix the lock?

482
00:35:44.078 --> 00:35:48.208
Nah, I replaced the lock.
But you gotta fix that door.

483
00:35:48.315 --> 00:35:51.716
- Just fix the lock!
- Sir, sir, sir. Listen to me.

484
00:35:51.819 --> 00:35:54.982
What you need
is a new door.

485
00:35:55.089 --> 00:35:57.523
- I need new door?
- Yeah.

486
00:35:57.625 --> 00:36:00.093
Okay. How much?

487
00:36:00.194 --> 00:36:04.130
I don't... Sir, you're gonna have to call
somebody that sells doors.

488
00:36:04.231 --> 00:36:08.327
You try to cheat me, right?
You have a friend that fix door?

489
00:36:08.469 --> 00:36:10.596
Nah, I don't have a friend
that fix doors, bro.

490
00:36:10.738 --> 00:36:13.070
Then go and fix the fucking lock, you cheater.

491
00:36:13.174 --> 00:36:15.938
You... You know what?

492
00:36:16.043 --> 00:36:19.501
Why don't you just pay for the lock
and I won't charge you for the time.

493
00:36:19.613 --> 00:36:22.013
You don't fix the lock!
I pay! You think I'm stupid?

494
00:36:22.116 --> 00:36:25.279
You fix the fucking lock,
you cheater!

495
00:36:25.386 --> 00:36:27.877
- I'd appreciate if you'd stop calling me names.
- Then fix the fucking lock!

496
00:36:27.988 --> 00:36:31.424
I replaced the lock!
You gotta fix the fucking door!

497
00:36:31.525 --> 00:36:34.756
You cheat!
You fucking cheater!

498
00:36:34.862 --> 00:36:37.558
- Fine. Don't pay.
- What?

499
00:36:37.665 --> 00:36:40.395
- Have a good night.
- What? No. Wait!

500
00:36:40.534 --> 00:36:43.503
Wait! You come back here!
You fix the lock!

501
00:36:43.637 --> 00:36:45.764
Come here! You fix my lock!

502
00:36:45.906 --> 00:36:47.396
Fix the fucking lock!

503
00:36:53.614 --> 00:36:57.573
I understand. You run over a Chinaman.
Stuff him in the back.

504
00:36:57.685 --> 00:37:00.552
Then bring the truck here
so I can share in the experience.

505
00:37:00.654 --> 00:37:03.487
Come on, man. It's a little bit of blood.
It'll wash right off.

506
00:37:03.591 --> 00:37:05.889
- Georgie, burn this thing.
- Burn it?

507
00:37:05.993 --> 00:37:08.223
It's a brand-new Navigator.
All you need is a little piece of carpet.

508
00:37:08.329 --> 00:37:10.320
You watch the Discovery Channel?

509
00:37:10.431 --> 00:37:13.832
- Not a lot.
- They got some good shit on that channel.

510
00:37:13.968 --> 00:37:17.529
Every night there is a show
with somebody shining a blue light

511
00:37:17.671 --> 00:37:21.869
and finding tiny specks of blood splattered
on carpets and walls and ceiling fans,

512
00:37:21.976 --> 00:37:26.504
bathroom fixtures and special-edition plastic
Burger King tray cups.

513
00:37:26.614 --> 00:37:30.106
The next thing they show is some stupid
redneck in handcuffs

514
00:37:30.217 --> 00:37:34.415
who looks absolutely stunned
that this is happening to him.

515
00:37:34.521 --> 00:37:37.547
Sometimes the redneck is actually watching
the Discovery Channel

516
00:37:37.658 --> 00:37:39.649
when they break in to arrest him.

517
00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:44.993
And he still can't figure out how on earth
they could've caught him!

518
00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:56.842
Do I look like I wanna be
on the Discovery Channel?

519
00:37:56.944 --> 00:37:58.138
No.

520
00:37:58.245 --> 00:38:00.805
Then get the fuck
outta my shop.

521
00:38:03.317 --> 00:38:05.444
Oh, yeah, make sure
you get that.

522
00:38:05.552 --> 00:38:08.953
Without him, things could've gone really
fucking wrong tonight.

523
00:38:11.058 --> 00:38:14.824
- Fuck!
- Don't! Don't you dare.

524
00:38:14.928 --> 00:38:16.793
Don't.

525
00:38:16.897 --> 00:38:19.991
Graham Waters.

526
00:38:20.134 --> 00:38:24.366
No. No, he's not here, Mom.

527
00:38:25.839 --> 00:38:28.808
I'm not gonna go looking for him.

528
00:38:28.942 --> 00:38:32.241
Look, he'll be home when...
Just leave it alone.

529
00:38:32.346 --> 00:38:37.010
Mom, I can't talk to you right now, okay?
I'm having sex with a white woman.

530
00:38:37.117 --> 00:38:39.551
Okay, where were we?

531
00:38:39.653 --> 00:38:42.121
I was white, and you were
about to jerk off in the shower.

532
00:38:42.222 --> 00:38:45.089
Oh, shit!

533
00:38:45.192 --> 00:38:47.251
Come on.

534
00:38:47.361 --> 00:38:52.321
I would've said you were Mexican, but I don't
think it would've pissed her off as much.

535
00:38:52.433 --> 00:38:54.731
Why do you keep everybody
at a certain distance, huh?

536
00:38:54.868 --> 00:38:58.497
- What, you start to feel something and panic?
- Come on, Maria.

537
00:38:58.639 --> 00:39:02.075
You're just pissed
'cause I answered the phone.

538
00:39:02.176 --> 00:39:04.542
That's just where
I begin to get pissed.

539
00:39:04.645 --> 00:39:07.978
I mean, really, what kind of man
speaks to his mother that way?

540
00:39:08.082 --> 00:39:12.143
Oh, this is about my mother.
What do you know about my mother?

541
00:39:12.252 --> 00:39:15.187
If I was your father,
I'd kick your fucking ass.

542
00:39:16.657 --> 00:39:18.648
Okay. I was raised badly.

543
00:39:18.759 --> 00:39:22.195
Why don't you take your clothes off,
get back into bed and teach me a lesson?

544
00:39:22.296 --> 00:39:26.255
You want a lesson? I'll give you a lesson.
How 'bout a geography lesson?

545
00:39:26.367 --> 00:39:30.497
My father's from Puerto Rico.
My mother's from El Salvador.

546
00:39:30.637 --> 00:39:33.663
Neither one of those is Mexico.

547
00:39:33.807 --> 00:39:36.241
Ah. Then I guess the big mystery is

548
00:39:36.343 --> 00:39:39.801
who gathered all those
remarkably different cultures together

549
00:39:39.913 --> 00:39:42.973
and taught them all how
to park their cars on their lawns?

550
00:40:10.778 --> 00:40:13.144
Pop, you okay?

551
00:40:13.247 --> 00:40:16.273
If I could piss, I'd be okay.

552
00:40:17.818 --> 00:40:20.548
I'm... Jesus.

553
00:40:20.654 --> 00:40:23.145
I'm done now.

554
00:40:23.257 --> 00:40:25.282
Give me a hand.

555
00:40:27.795 --> 00:40:29.729
Wait a goddamn minute!

556
00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:32.492
- Wait a minute.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

557
00:40:34.501 --> 00:40:37.937
All right. Okay. Okay.

558
00:40:45.345 --> 00:40:47.939
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop!

559
00:40:48.048 --> 00:40:50.710
- I gotta go back.
- Okay.

560
00:41:02.996 --> 00:41:06.090
What, are you gonna
stand there and stare at me?

561
00:42:15.068 --> 00:42:17.696
- So Conklin just shot him?
- Mm-hmm.

562
00:42:17.838 --> 00:42:19.499
- They know each other?
- Sir.

563
00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:20.732
It's a grudge thing?

564
00:42:20.874 --> 00:42:22.774
Not as far as we can tell.

565
00:42:24.111 --> 00:42:25.908
You think this is
racially motivated?

566
00:42:26.013 --> 00:42:29.346
Well, a dozen people heard the shots.
Nobody saw anything.

567
00:42:29.449 --> 00:42:31.417
- Who do we have on it?
- Graham Waters.

568
00:42:31.518 --> 00:42:35.511
Waters. All right. Well, tell him
he speaks to no one but me.

569
00:42:35.622 --> 00:42:38.785
Call a press conference for 4:00,
and I want Waters here at 3:30.

570
00:42:38.892 --> 00:42:40.792
And would someone
please find Flanagan.

571
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:44.456
Oh! What up, Mo Phat?

572
00:42:46.166 --> 00:42:50.466
Man robs purses from old ladies and you,
"Hey, how's it goin', Mo Phat?"

573
00:42:50.604 --> 00:42:53.596
That nigger will steal teeth
from a cripple, man.

574
00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:56.231
You callin' him a thief?
And we do what?

575
00:42:56.376 --> 00:42:58.276
The man steals
from black people.

576
00:42:58.378 --> 00:43:02.610
Only reason black people steal from their own
is 'cause they terrified of white people.

577
00:43:02.716 --> 00:43:03.978
Oh, man, please.

578
00:43:04.084 --> 00:43:07.451
Think about it. Sherman Oaks.
Burbank. Santa Monica.

579
00:43:07.554 --> 00:43:10.114
All scary-ass places
for a brother to find himself.

580
00:43:10.223 --> 00:43:12.623
Drop Mo Phat at a Starbucks
in Toluca Lake,

581
00:43:12.726 --> 00:43:16.856
that nigger will run like a rabbit soon
as somebody say "decaf latte. "

582
00:43:16.964 --> 00:43:20.195
What the fuck did you do to my car?

583
00:43:27.608 --> 00:43:31.044
Sorry I take your car, Miss Jean.

584
00:43:31.144 --> 00:43:34.113
I turn key to my car, but nothing.

585
00:43:34.214 --> 00:43:36.148
James wanted to take this to school.

586
00:43:36.249 --> 00:43:38.945
But I don't want the kids to fight over it.

587
00:43:39.052 --> 00:43:42.783
- Are these clean or dirty?
- All clean, senora!

588
00:43:42.889 --> 00:43:47.792
You know, Maria, just once I would like to
wake up and find these dishes in the cabinet.

589
00:43:49.129 --> 00:43:51.689
<i>Si, senora</i>.
No problem.

590
00:43:53.266 --> 00:43:55.029
I'm startin' to understand now.

591
00:43:55.168 --> 00:43:58.069
By your work, you're settin' an example
for our neighborhood.

592
00:43:58.171 --> 00:44:00.639
Sort of like a big brother
kind of thing, right?

593
00:44:01.675 --> 00:44:03.142
Yeah, you laugh, man.

594
00:44:03.276 --> 00:44:07.406
But you have never seen me steal
from a black person ever in your life.

595
00:44:09.449 --> 00:44:11.576
What the hell do you think
you doin' right now, man?

596
00:44:11.685 --> 00:44:13.152
Wavin' down the bus.

597
00:44:13.253 --> 00:44:15.744
Put your hand down, dawg!
Are you outta your mind?

598
00:44:15.856 --> 00:44:18.256
You actually expect me
to get on a bus?

599
00:44:18.358 --> 00:44:20.622
No. I was hopin' we could
push your car across town.

600
00:44:20.727 --> 00:44:22.661
You know why? 'Cause we just don't
do stuff like that no more.

601
00:44:22.763 --> 00:44:25.391
You have no idea, do you?

602
00:44:25.499 --> 00:44:28.991
You have no idea why they put them great big
windows on the sides of buses, do you?

603
00:44:29.136 --> 00:44:31.627
- Why?
- One reason only.

604
00:44:31.772 --> 00:44:36.106
To humiliate the people of color
who are reduced to ridin' on 'em.

605
00:44:36.209 --> 00:44:37.574
I didn't know that.

606
00:44:37.678 --> 00:44:40.647
You could fill the Staples Center
with what you don't know.

607
00:44:40.747 --> 00:44:42.715
You know the Kings
are playin' tonight.

608
00:44:42.816 --> 00:44:46.183
You don't like hockey! The only reason
you say you do is to piss me off!

609
00:44:46.286 --> 00:44:48.584
I love hockey.

610
00:44:48.689 --> 00:44:50.247
Cut! Print. Moving on.

611
00:44:50.357 --> 00:44:51.483
Okay, that takes us into scene 12.

612
00:44:51.558 --> 00:44:52.923
Okay, that takes us into scene 12.

613
00:44:54.661 --> 00:44:57.687
Jamal, that's what
I'm talking about.

614
00:44:57.798 --> 00:44:59.163
Right on.

615
00:45:01.068 --> 00:45:04.504
- Cam, you got a second?
- Yeah, Fred, I just wanna grab some coffee.

616
00:45:04.604 --> 00:45:07.368
Yeah. Listen. I think
we need another take, buddy.

617
00:45:07.474 --> 00:45:10.204
That looked
pretty terrific, man.

618
00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:14.474
This is gonna sound strange, but is Jamal
seeing a speech coach or something?

619
00:45:14.581 --> 00:45:16.515
What do you mean?

620
00:45:16.616 --> 00:45:20.074
Have you noticed, uh...
This is weird for a white guy to say,

621
00:45:20.187 --> 00:45:23.953
but have you noticed
he's talking a lot less black lately?

622
00:45:26.059 --> 00:45:27.526
No, I haven't noticed that.

623
00:45:27.627 --> 00:45:31.620
Really? Like in this scene, he was supposed to
say, "Don't be talkin' 'bout that. "

624
00:45:31.732 --> 00:45:34.064
And he changed it to,
"Don't talk to me about that. "

625
00:45:34.201 --> 00:45:35.463
Wait a minute.

626
00:45:35.602 --> 00:45:40.130
You think because of that, the audience
won't recognize him as being a black man?

627
00:45:40.273 --> 00:45:41.240
Come on!

628
00:45:41.374 --> 00:45:43.433
Is there a problem, Cam?

629
00:45:43.577 --> 00:45:45.169
Excuse me?

630
00:45:45.278 --> 00:45:47.576
Is there a problem, Cam?

631
00:45:52.486 --> 00:45:55.011
No, we don't have a problem.

632
00:45:55.122 --> 00:45:58.319
I mean, 'cause all I'm saying
is it's not his character.

633
00:45:58.425 --> 00:46:01.019
Eddie's supposed to be
the smart one, not Jamal, right?

634
00:46:01.128 --> 00:46:04.928
You're the expert here.
But to me, it rings false.

635
00:46:08.301 --> 00:46:12.101
- We're gonna do it one more time.
- Thanks, buddy.

636
00:46:12.205 --> 00:46:16.141
Everybody back.
Let's do it one more time.

637
00:46:18.678 --> 00:46:20.771
Jamal, um...

638
00:46:24.985 --> 00:46:26.612
Morning, Carol.
Who do I have?

639
00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.051
Hold for a minute, please.

640
00:46:28.155 --> 00:46:32.353
Mr. Trujillo called and cancelled,
but you have a walk-in, Mr. Ryan.

641
00:46:35.595 --> 00:46:38.325
Send him in.

642
00:46:38.431 --> 00:46:40.729
- Mr. Ryan.
- Yeah.

643
00:46:40.834 --> 00:46:42.995
My name is Shaniqua Johnson.

644
00:46:43.136 --> 00:46:45.696
I believe we spoke last night.

645
00:46:45.839 --> 00:46:49.275
Oh, yeah. I wanted
to apologize about that.

646
00:46:49.409 --> 00:46:52.401
I haven't been gettin' too much sleep.
My father's in a lot of pain.

647
00:46:52.512 --> 00:46:55.003
Oh! I'm sorry to hear that.

648
00:46:55.115 --> 00:46:59.211
This doctor he's been seein'
says he's got a urinary tract infection.

649
00:46:59.319 --> 00:47:02.811
But he's been takin' this medicine for a month,
and he keeps gettin' worse.

650
00:47:02.923 --> 00:47:04.948
And he's been back to see
Dr. Robertson?

651
00:47:05.058 --> 00:47:07.754
Yeah. Between you and me,
the man's an idiot.

652
00:47:07.861 --> 00:47:09.795
- Really?
- No offense.

653
00:47:09.896 --> 00:47:13.332
But the guy sees 100 patients an hour.
I think his nurses are doing most of the work.

654
00:47:13.433 --> 00:47:18.496
Mmm. If you're unhappy, your father's welcome
to see a doctor outside the network.

655
00:47:18.638 --> 00:47:23.075
And if this new doctor
says it's not an infection,

656
00:47:23.176 --> 00:47:26.304
says it's his prostate and it needs to be
operated on, is that gonna be covered?

657
00:47:26.413 --> 00:47:30.008
- Not unless Dr. Robertson authorizes...
- What good is that gonna do?

658
00:47:30.116 --> 00:47:32.812
I'm sorry. There's nothing else I can do.

659
00:47:32.919 --> 00:47:35.285
All right.
You know what I can't do?

660
00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:39.184
I can't look at you without
thinking about the five or six

661
00:47:39.292 --> 00:47:41.658
more qualified white men
who didn't get your job.

662
00:47:41.761 --> 00:47:43.490
It's time for you to go.

663
00:47:43.597 --> 00:47:46.725
I'm saying this 'cause I'm hoping
that I'm wrong about you.

664
00:47:46.833 --> 00:47:48.460
I'm hoping that someone like yourself,

665
00:47:48.602 --> 00:47:50.832
someone who may have been
given a helping hand,

666
00:47:50.971 --> 00:47:53.735
might have a little compassion
for someone in a similar situation.

667
00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:55.899
Carol, I need security in my office!

668
00:47:56.042 --> 00:47:59.068
You don't like me, that's fine.
I'm a prick.

669
00:47:59.179 --> 00:48:01.739
My father doesn't deserve
to suffer like this.

670
00:48:01.848 --> 00:48:03.873
He was a janitor.
He struggled his whole life.

671
00:48:03.984 --> 00:48:05.815
Saved enough to start
his own company.

672
00:48:05.919 --> 00:48:07.887
Twenty-three employees,
all of them black.

673
00:48:07.988 --> 00:48:10.684
Paid 'em equal wages
when no one else was doing that.

674
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:15.659
For 30 years he worked side by side with
those men, sweeping and carrying garbage.

675
00:48:15.762 --> 00:48:17.627
Then the city council decides to give

676
00:48:17.731 --> 00:48:20.996
minority-owned companies
preference in city contracts.

677
00:48:21.134 --> 00:48:23.864
And overnight,
my father loses everything.

678
00:48:24.004 --> 00:48:27.405
His business, his home, his wife.
Everything!

679
00:48:27.507 --> 00:48:31.170
Not once does he blame your people.

680
00:48:31.278 --> 00:48:34.770
I'm not asking you to help me.

681
00:48:34.881 --> 00:48:39.215
I'm asking that you do this small thing
for a man who lost everything

682
00:48:39.319 --> 00:48:41.651
so people like yourself
could reap the benefits.

683
00:48:41.755 --> 00:48:44.053
And do you know
what it's gonna cost you?

684
00:48:44.157 --> 00:48:46.091
Nothing.

685
00:48:46.192 --> 00:48:48.126
Just a flick of your pen.

686
00:48:49.696 --> 00:48:52.631
Your father sounds
like a good man.

687
00:48:52.732 --> 00:48:56.862
And if he'd come in here today, I probably
would've approved this request.

688
00:48:57.003 --> 00:49:01.440
But he didn't come in. You did.
And for his sake, it's a real shame.

689
00:49:01.508 --> 00:49:04.477
Get him the hell outta my office.

690
00:49:08.581 --> 00:49:11.482
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

691
00:49:11.584 --> 00:49:16.214
Sir, I spoke to our employee, and he told you
you needed to replace or repair the door.

692
00:49:16.323 --> 00:49:17.984
He say he fix the lock.

693
00:49:18.091 --> 00:49:20.685
- You come here, see how "fix-ed" it is!
- <i>You're yelling again</i>.

694
00:49:20.794 --> 00:49:22.694
I am not yelling! I'm upset!

695
00:49:22.796 --> 00:49:25.162
Yes... Yes, I am.

696
00:49:25.265 --> 00:49:26.892
Mom, are you all right?

697
00:49:27.033 --> 00:49:31.265
Stop washing.
Insurance must take picture.

698
00:49:31.404 --> 00:49:32.871
Okay?

699
00:49:34.274 --> 00:49:36.640
Look what they wrote.

700
00:49:36.743 --> 00:49:38.711
They think we're Arab.

701
00:49:38.845 --> 00:49:40.904
When did Persian become Arab?

702
00:49:41.014 --> 00:49:43.847
I want his name. Yes.

703
00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:45.542
Oh, my God.

704
00:49:45.652 --> 00:49:48.712
- I want his name! Give me his name!
- Dad?

705
00:49:48.822 --> 00:49:50.187
I'm not giving you his name, sir.

706
00:49:50.290 --> 00:49:54.090
- Dad, did they take the gun?
- Not fix my lock! I want his name!

707
00:49:54.194 --> 00:49:56.219
I'm gonna hang up now, sir.

708
00:49:56.329 --> 00:50:00.095
Don't hang up! Shit!

709
00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:02.031
Oh, thank God.

710
00:50:47.981 --> 00:50:49.243
Mom?

711
00:50:51.017 --> 00:50:53.247
Mom, it's cold. Come on.

712
00:51:15.508 --> 00:51:17.806
Did you find your brother?

713
00:51:19.946 --> 00:51:22.073
No, Mom.

714
00:51:31.558 --> 00:51:34.083
I was doin' good.

715
00:51:35.395 --> 00:51:38.853
I was... I was doin' real good.

716
00:51:40.667 --> 00:51:42.965
- I know, Mom.
- I was doin'...

717
00:51:47.907 --> 00:51:49.841
It's okay.

718
00:52:01.221 --> 00:52:03.382
Did you find your brother?

719
00:52:05.725 --> 00:52:08.125
No, Mom.

720
00:52:09.462 --> 00:52:11.987
Tell him to come home.

721
00:52:13.399 --> 00:52:18.666
Tell him I'm not mad, okay?
Okay, baby?

722
00:52:18.805 --> 00:52:21.365
Okay, Mom.

723
00:52:21.508 --> 00:52:23.976
Okay, baby.

724
00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:25.702
Okay.

725
00:52:26.746 --> 00:52:28.771
Okay.

726
00:53:04.384 --> 00:53:07.319
- Did you apologize to your mother?
- She wasn't there.

727
00:53:09.289 --> 00:53:12.918
Internal Affairs called.
Found something in the Mercedes.

728
00:53:15.695 --> 00:53:17.925
That's lunch. One hour.

729
00:53:47.126 --> 00:53:48.957
I tried to call.

730
00:53:49.062 --> 00:53:51.189
Sounded like you're havin'
a bad day, huh?

731
00:53:51.297 --> 00:53:52.594
Yeah.

732
00:53:57.103 --> 00:53:58.900
What?

733
00:53:59.906 --> 00:54:01.874
I got scared, Cam.

734
00:54:01.975 --> 00:54:07.436
It's not like I haven't been
pulled over before. You know?

735
00:54:07.547 --> 00:54:09.538
But not like that.

736
00:54:10.883 --> 00:54:12.874
And, yes, I was a little drunk.

737
00:54:12.986 --> 00:54:16.922
And I was mouthing off.

738
00:54:17.023 --> 00:54:19.218
I'm sorry.

739
00:54:21.361 --> 00:54:23.090
But when that man was
putting his hands on me...

740
00:54:23.196 --> 00:54:24.891
I don't wanna talk about it.

741
00:54:24.998 --> 00:54:28.331
I can't believe
you let him do that, baby.

742
00:54:29.702 --> 00:54:33.297
Look, I know what you did
was the right thing. Okay?

743
00:54:34.874 --> 00:54:37.570
But I was humiliated!

744
00:54:37.677 --> 00:54:39.838
For you.

745
00:54:39.946 --> 00:54:44.406
I just couldn't stand to see
that man take away your dignity.

746
00:54:44.517 --> 00:54:47.543
Yeah. That's what happened.

747
00:54:47.654 --> 00:54:50.680
- Oh, baby, don't do this.
- No. No, you're right.

748
00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:52.553
I ain't doin' it.

749
00:54:52.659 --> 00:54:55.184
You gonna walk away from me?

750
00:54:55.295 --> 00:54:58.458
- Cameron!
- Just go home.

751
00:55:04.504 --> 00:55:05.835
Mm-hmm.

752
00:55:07.373 --> 00:55:08.340
I understand.

753
00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:11.638
Thanks.

754
00:55:15.014 --> 00:55:18.415
- Has your father read his policy?
- He doesn't read English.

755
00:55:22.255 --> 00:55:24.519
Mr. Golzari, you said
you called the locksmith?

756
00:55:26.359 --> 00:55:27.519
Yes. I tell him, fix it.

757
00:55:28.461 --> 00:55:34.764
They said their man told you to fix the door,
and you didn't do so.

758
00:55:36.803 --> 00:55:38.794
Are you saying it's his fault?

759
00:55:40.139 --> 00:55:44.542
Insurance company is calling it negligence.
They're not covering any of this.

760
00:55:52.251 --> 00:55:57.348
No. This store is all we have.

761
00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:16.565
I really am sorry.

762
00:56:39.132 --> 00:56:41.293
What time
you must go to work?

763
00:56:41.434 --> 00:56:42.662
Not until tonight.

764
00:56:44.437 --> 00:56:45.904
Go home and sleep.

765
00:56:49.142 --> 00:56:51.736
It's okay. It's okay.
Go home and sleep.

766
00:57:15.001 --> 00:57:16.059
Hey.

767
00:57:17.870 --> 00:57:21.271
Maybe they didn't tell you,
but I've been reassigned.

768
00:57:21.374 --> 00:57:23.569
Yeah, they told me.

769
00:57:23.676 --> 00:57:26.474
I just wanted to say, good luck

770
00:57:26.579 --> 00:57:28.410
and it was good ridin' with you.

771
00:57:28.514 --> 00:57:30.175
You too.

772
00:57:33.186 --> 00:57:36.451
Wait till you've been
on the job a few more years.

773
00:57:36.556 --> 00:57:39.753
- Yeah.
- Look at me, look at me.

774
00:57:39.859 --> 00:57:44.489
Wait till you've been doin' it
a little longer.

775
00:57:44.597 --> 00:57:48.499
You think you know
who you are, hmm?

776
00:57:48.634 --> 00:57:51.398
You have no idea.

777
00:57:54.907 --> 00:57:57.933
Yo, Gomez,
you ready to roll, homie?

778
00:57:58.044 --> 00:57:59.875
Ready, amigo.

779
00:58:09.689 --> 00:58:12.715
Radio check, 2-1-L-2-3.

780
00:58:12.825 --> 00:58:17.489
<i>2- 1-L-23, picking up screams and noises</i>
<i>from your car</i>.

781
00:58:17.597 --> 00:58:21.397
<i>21-L, is your mike open</i>
<i>by any chance?</i>

782
01:00:33.866 --> 01:00:34.696
Call it in.

783
01:01:13.239 --> 01:01:14.001
Ma'am?

784
01:01:14.106 --> 01:01:16.006
Can you hear me?

785
01:01:16.108 --> 01:01:18.668
Paramedics are rolling.
They'll be here in two minutes.

786
01:01:18.778 --> 01:01:21.838
- Get an extinguisher, and get that fire out.
- Jesus.

787
01:01:25.518 --> 01:01:28.919
Ma'am, are you hurt?

788
01:01:29.021 --> 01:01:32.081
- Can you move?
- L... I can't breathe.

789
01:01:35.161 --> 01:01:38.187
Okay, I'm gonna get you out.

790
01:01:45.004 --> 01:01:46.471
It's okay.

791
01:01:50.676 --> 01:01:53.167
Okay. Okay.

792
01:01:53.279 --> 01:01:55.179
Okay, I'm gonna get you out.

793
01:01:59.452 --> 01:02:01.545
No!

794
01:02:01.654 --> 01:02:04.589
- It's okay.
- Get away from me!

795
01:02:04.757 --> 01:02:07.783
Get away.
Stay away from me!

796
01:02:07.893 --> 01:02:11.192
Not you! Not you!

797
01:02:11.297 --> 01:02:14.095
- It's okay.
- Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

798
01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:17.795
- Keep away from me!
- Lady, I'm tryin'... I'm tryin' to help you.

799
01:02:17.937 --> 01:02:20.428
Fuck you! Not you!

800
01:02:20.573 --> 01:02:23.542
Somebody! Anybody else!

801
01:02:23.642 --> 01:02:27.305
- Please, somebody! Not you!
- Stop moving!

802
01:02:27.413 --> 01:02:30.905
No! Get your filthy
fucking hands off me!

803
01:02:31.016 --> 01:02:35.180
Stop moving. Lady, I'm not
gonna fucking hurt you!

804
01:02:40.159 --> 01:02:43.253
Okay. Okay.

805
01:02:43.362 --> 01:02:45.227
Please don't touch me. Don't, don't.

806
01:02:45.331 --> 01:02:49.097
I'm not gonna touch you.
But there's nobody else here yet

807
01:02:49.235 --> 01:02:51.203
and that's gasoline there.

808
01:02:52.872 --> 01:02:56.137
We need to get you
outta here right away. Okay?

809
01:02:56.242 --> 01:02:58.437
Oh, my... Oh, my...
Oh, my... Oh, my God.

810
01:02:58.544 --> 01:03:04.244
Okay. I need to reach across your lap.
Can I do that, please?

811
01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:09.488
Yeah. Yeah.

812
01:03:10.890 --> 01:03:12.551
Thanks.

813
01:03:16.529 --> 01:03:20.295
Is anything broken?

814
01:03:20.399 --> 01:03:22.833
L- I don't think so.

815
01:03:22.968 --> 01:03:25.869
Okay. Then that's good.

816
01:03:25.971 --> 01:03:28.462
Are you... Are you
gonna get me out?

817
01:03:28.607 --> 01:03:31.872
Yeah, I'm gonna get you out. Okay?

818
01:03:31.977 --> 01:03:35.310
Look at me. Look at me.
I'm gonna get you out.

819
01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:42.987
Oh, fuck!

820
01:03:43.088 --> 01:03:46.080
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

821
01:03:48.194 --> 01:03:50.992
I'm gonna have to cut your belt, okay?

822
01:03:51.096 --> 01:03:53.189
I'm gonna have to cut the belt.

823
01:03:54.333 --> 01:03:55.800
It's okay, it's okay.

824
01:03:55.935 --> 01:03:58.529
It's okay.
Okay, we're gonna get you out.

825
01:03:58.671 --> 01:04:00.969
Everything's gonna be fine.
Look at me!

826
01:04:01.073 --> 01:04:03.541
Everything's gonna be fine.
We're gonna get you outta here.

827
01:04:03.676 --> 01:04:05.473
Everything's gonna be fine.

828
01:04:22.027 --> 01:04:24.495
Ryan!

829
01:04:59.765 --> 01:05:01.198
Pull!

830
01:05:16.482 --> 01:05:17.779
It's okay.

831
01:05:27.259 --> 01:05:28.692
It's okay.

832
01:05:29.662 --> 01:05:33.291
All right.
It's okay, it's okay.

833
01:05:33.399 --> 01:05:35.867
It's all right.
I got it. I got it.

834
01:05:36.001 --> 01:05:37.969
Ma'am? Ma'am,
can you walk with me?

835
01:05:38.103 --> 01:05:40.469
It's cool, it's cool.

836
01:05:41.874 --> 01:05:44.866
Here we go.
All right, you're doin' great.

837
01:06:16.075 --> 01:06:19.272
The D.A. Wanted me to apologize.
He really wanted to be here himself.

838
01:06:19.378 --> 01:06:22.108
No, he didn't! If he did his own dirty work
none of us would have jobs.

839
01:06:22.214 --> 01:06:24.478
- Jake Flanagan. I work with Rick.
- Graham Waters.

840
01:06:24.583 --> 01:06:27.416
- Thanks for coming in.
- He just pulled into the garage.

841
01:06:27.519 --> 01:06:30.647
Great. Press conference is in ten minutes,
so we'll make this short.

842
01:06:30.756 --> 01:06:34.123
Internal Affairs says this Conklin
has two suspicious shootings on his record.

843
01:06:34.226 --> 01:06:37.491
Both black men.
Both times he was cleared, but only just.

844
01:06:37.596 --> 01:06:40.394
Detective Lewis
makes black man number three.

845
01:06:40.499 --> 01:06:43.957
You know any reason why
we shouldn't hang Conklin for this?

846
01:06:44.103 --> 01:06:49.097
Well, it's more complicated
than we originally thought.

847
01:06:49.241 --> 01:06:55.111
We found $300,000 in the trunk of the car
that Detective Lewis was driving.

848
01:06:55.214 --> 01:06:57.273
Shit!

849
01:06:57.383 --> 01:07:01.877
Ah. Go down to the garage. Tell him
to stay in the car until he hears from me.

850
01:07:01.987 --> 01:07:05.889
You found the money in the Mercedes.
I thought that wasn't his car.

851
01:07:05.991 --> 01:07:10.189
The car's registered to a Cindy Bradley.
We haven't been able to get in touch with her.

852
01:07:10.295 --> 01:07:13.423
Apparently she, uh,
left town this morning.

853
01:07:13.532 --> 01:07:17.332
So it wasn't Lewis's car. He may not have
known the money was in it.

854
01:07:23.742 --> 01:07:27.007
You really think you're gonna
be able to make that fly?

855
01:07:28.714 --> 01:07:29.772
Give us a minute.

856
01:07:31.417 --> 01:07:33.578
No problem.

857
01:07:41.093 --> 01:07:43.288
Who knows about the money?

858
01:07:43.395 --> 01:07:45.420
You gotta be kiddin' me.

859
01:07:45.531 --> 01:07:49.399
There are only two people
in this room.

860
01:07:49.535 --> 01:07:52.868
Myself, my partner,
Ferguson and Internal Affairs.

861
01:07:52.971 --> 01:07:55.439
- Jim Ferguson?
- Yeah.

862
01:07:59.978 --> 01:08:02.412
Okay. I guess
I don't see a problem.

863
01:08:02.514 --> 01:08:05.039
As it wasn't Lewis's car, the money isn't
clear evidence of any wrongdoing.

864
01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:08.119
And even if it was, we aren't
going to prosecute a dead man.

865
01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:12.623
Which means the money Internal Affairs
is holding can't be considered evidence.

866
01:08:12.724 --> 01:08:15.022
You can do this dance if you want to,

867
01:08:15.127 --> 01:08:18.585
but I'm willing to bet when the coroner's report
comes back tomorrow

868
01:08:18.697 --> 01:08:21.666
it's going to say that Detective Lewis
was coked out of his head.

869
01:08:23.135 --> 01:08:24.602
Fucking black people, huh?

870
01:08:24.703 --> 01:08:26.728
What did you just say?

871
01:08:26.872 --> 01:08:28.840
I mean,

872
01:08:28.941 --> 01:08:31.432
I know all the sociological
reasons why per capita

873
01:08:31.577 --> 01:08:34.637
eight times more black men
are incarcerated than white men.

874
01:08:34.746 --> 01:08:38.614
Schools are a disgrace. Lack of opportunity.
Bias in the judicial system.

875
01:08:38.717 --> 01:08:40.685
All that stuff.
All that stuff!

876
01:08:40.786 --> 01:08:44.847
But still, it's gotta get to you,
on a gut level as a black man,

877
01:08:44.957 --> 01:08:47.892
they just can't keep their hands
out of the cookie jar.

878
01:08:53.132 --> 01:08:55.225
Of course, you and I
know that's not the truth.

879
01:08:55.334 --> 01:08:57.325
But that's the way
it always plays, doesn't it?

880
01:08:57.469 --> 01:09:00.905
And assholes like Lewis keep
feeding the flames. It's gotta get to you.

881
01:09:02.174 --> 01:09:04.472
What did you say
you did for the D.A. Again?

882
01:09:04.576 --> 01:09:06.544
You coach ball down in Compton.
Am I right?

883
01:09:06.645 --> 01:09:08.579
Oh, please, don't do that.

884
01:09:09.381 --> 01:09:11.508
Don't act like you know
something about me, okay?

885
01:09:11.617 --> 01:09:16.020
What do you think those kids need...
to make them believe, to give them hope?

886
01:09:16.121 --> 01:09:18.282
You think they need another
drug-dealing cop

887
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:21.325
or do you think they need
a fallen black hero?

888
01:09:21.426 --> 01:09:26.022
Why don't you cut through the bullshit
and just tell me what it is you want.

889
01:09:28.033 --> 01:09:30.831
The D.A.'s squad loses
its lead investigator next month.

890
01:09:30.969 --> 01:09:34.837
Rick is quite adamant
that his replacement be a person of color.

891
01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:39.104
It's a high-profile position, and he wants
to send the right message to the community.

892
01:09:39.211 --> 01:09:42.874
And the right message is,
"Look at this black boy I just bought?"

893
01:09:42.981 --> 01:09:46.576
Well, fuck you very much.
But thanks for thinking of me.

894
01:09:47.953 --> 01:09:50.353
Actually we were thinking of you.

895
01:09:51.723 --> 01:09:53.714
Until we saw that.

896
01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:55.854
It's your brother's file.

897
01:09:56.862 --> 01:09:59.092
Twenty-something years old
and already three felonies.

898
01:09:59.198 --> 01:10:01.894
Three strikes law. Kid's going away
for life for stealing a car.

899
01:10:02.034 --> 01:10:04.696
Christ, that's a shitty law.

900
01:10:04.836 --> 01:10:06.770
There's a warrant in there.

901
01:10:06.872 --> 01:10:11.206
But still, hey, he had
every opportunity you had.

902
01:10:14.046 --> 01:10:15.946
Fucking black people, huh?

903
01:10:20.319 --> 01:10:24.756
So all, uh... all I need to do
to make this disappear

904
01:10:24.856 --> 01:10:27.154
is to frame
a potentially innocent man?

905
01:10:27.259 --> 01:10:30.558
What are you? The fucking defender
of all things white?

906
01:10:30.662 --> 01:10:34.393
We're talking about a white man
who shot three black men.

907
01:10:34.499 --> 01:10:39.232
And you're arguing with me that maybe
we're not being fair to him?

908
01:10:39.371 --> 01:10:42.340
You know what? Maybe you're right.
Maybe Lewis did provoke this.

909
01:10:42.441 --> 01:10:44.602
And maybe he got exactly
what was coming to him.

910
01:10:44.710 --> 01:10:47.702
Or maybe stoned or not,
just being a black man in the Valley

911
01:10:47.813 --> 01:10:50.145
was enough to get him killed.

912
01:10:50.249 --> 01:10:54.310
There was no one there to see who shot first,
so there is no way to know.

913
01:10:54.419 --> 01:10:57.786
Which means we
could get this wrong.

914
01:10:59.658 --> 01:11:02.718
Maybe that's what happened with
your brother. Maybe we got it wrong.

915
01:11:02.828 --> 01:11:07.288
Maybe Lewis isn't the only one
who deserves the benefit of the doubt.

916
01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:09.963
You're the one closest to all this.

917
01:11:10.102 --> 01:11:11.865
You need to tell us.

918
01:11:15.707 --> 01:11:18.141
What does your gut tell you?

919
01:11:30.922 --> 01:11:34.085
So? Graham?

920
01:11:34.192 --> 01:11:36.319
What do I tell 'em?

921
01:11:36.428 --> 01:11:40.330
You tell me, and I'll tell them.

922
01:11:47.005 --> 01:11:51.169
Well, I think given
Detective Conklin's history,

923
01:11:51.276 --> 01:11:54.336
it's pretty clear
what happened last night.

924
01:11:54.446 --> 01:11:57.006
Okay.

925
01:12:13.632 --> 01:12:15.896
<i>Before I get to why we're here,</i>

926
01:12:16.034 --> 01:12:19.970
I know that many of you have heard
we had our car stolen last night.

927
01:12:20.072 --> 01:12:24.441
And as you could imagine, my wife and I
are both pretty shaken up.

928
01:12:24.543 --> 01:12:26.374
But we're okay.

929
01:12:26.478 --> 01:12:31.108
And Jean and I truly appreciate all your calls
and your concern. Thank you.

930
01:12:31.216 --> 01:12:36.813
Now, just after 9:00 p. m. Last night,
Detective William Lewis,

931
01:12:36.922 --> 01:12:40.085
an eight-year veteran of the force
and an active member of the black community,

932
01:12:40.192 --> 01:12:42.422
was gunned down
by a fellow officer.

933
01:13:42.921 --> 01:13:44.115
Get outta the car!

934
01:13:44.222 --> 01:13:46.087
Gimme the keys!
Get out... What the fuck?

935
01:13:48.093 --> 01:13:50.118
Whoa! What the fuck
are you doing, man?

936
01:13:50.228 --> 01:13:52.093
Shit! You wanna get killed, nigger?

937
01:13:52.197 --> 01:13:53.095
Say that again!

938
01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:57.395
- Say that again!
- You stupid motherfucker!

939
01:13:57.536 --> 01:14:00.835
Say it again, huh!
Call me a nigger again!

940
01:14:00.939 --> 01:14:03.305
- Man, what the fuck? Get off!
- Fuck you!

941
01:14:03.408 --> 01:14:06.241
- Shoot him!
- I'll blow your head off!

942
01:14:06.344 --> 01:14:09.404
- Shoot this motherfucker!
- I swear to God, I'm gonna blow your head off!

943
01:14:09.514 --> 01:14:10.640
Stop talkin' and shoot!

944
01:14:12.017 --> 01:14:14.884
- Stop! Let's go! Here comes the po-po.
- Get off of me!

945
01:14:16.988 --> 01:14:19.752
Hey, hey! Where you goin', man? Hell, no!

946
01:14:19.858 --> 01:14:21.826
- Oh, shit.
- Anthony! Anthony!

947
01:14:24.396 --> 01:14:25.658
Get the fuck outta my car!

948
01:14:25.764 --> 01:14:28.028
Shit! Damn!

949
01:14:28.133 --> 01:14:30.328
- What are you doin', man? Get outta the car!
- Fuck you!

950
01:14:34.339 --> 01:14:37.672
Car 25 in pursuit of a black Navigator.
West bound.

951
01:14:38.443 --> 01:14:40.638
I will blow you away!
Get the fuck out of the car!

952
01:14:40.745 --> 01:14:42.178
Go on! Shoot me then!

953
01:14:43.915 --> 01:14:48.249
2-2 Ida Tom Adam 3...
Oh, Christ!

954
01:14:53.825 --> 01:14:56.020
- Get the fuck outta the car!
- You get the fuck outta the car!

955
01:14:56.127 --> 01:14:58.493
- Get outta the fucking car!
- It's my fucking car!

956
01:14:58.597 --> 01:15:00.963
- It's my fucking gun!
- Fuck, it's my gun now!

957
01:15:01.066 --> 01:15:03.261
Gimme my fucking gun!

958
01:15:10.609 --> 01:15:12.372
Fuck!

959
01:15:14.145 --> 01:15:18.047
Hands in plain sight!
Step out of the vehicle!

960
01:15:20.952 --> 01:15:24.945
Hands in plain sight!
Step out of the vehicle!

961
01:15:28.226 --> 01:15:30.786
Slowly step out of the vehicle.

962
01:15:30.896 --> 01:15:34.593
- Get out of my car.
- You so brave, you get outta the car, man.

963
01:15:37.702 --> 01:15:41.502
Turn off the engine.
Throw the keys out the window.

964
01:15:54.152 --> 01:15:57.485
You fucking want me?
Here I am, you pig fuck!

965
01:15:57.589 --> 01:15:58.954
Lie face down on the ground.

966
01:15:59.057 --> 01:16:01.719
- Spread your arms and legs.
- No, you lie face down!

967
01:16:01.826 --> 01:16:03.919
Don't come any closer!
Down on your knees!

968
01:16:04.029 --> 01:16:06.497
Fuck you! What are you gonna do?
Pull the fucking trigger!

969
01:16:06.598 --> 01:16:07.530
On your knees now!

970
01:16:07.632 --> 01:16:10.362
You get on your knees
and suck my fucking dick!

971
01:16:10.502 --> 01:16:13.198
Do I look like
I'm fucking joking with you?

972
01:16:13.338 --> 01:16:14.862
That's what you look like,
a fucking joke to me.

973
01:16:15.006 --> 01:16:17.201
- This man is making threatening gestures.
- Threatening gestures?

974
01:16:17.309 --> 01:16:19.641
You wanna see a threatening gesture?
I got a threatening gesture.

975
01:16:19.744 --> 01:16:23.441
- I know this man! I know this man!
- Get back.

976
01:16:23.548 --> 01:16:26.073
- Give me some space. I know this guy.
- Get outta the way.

977
01:16:26.184 --> 01:16:27.276
Step away.

978
01:16:27.385 --> 01:16:29.410
Give me some goddamn room.
I know this guy.

979
01:16:31.289 --> 01:16:33.849
- Man, don't walk up on me!
- See what's happening here?

980
01:16:33.959 --> 01:16:36.154
Do you wanna die here, huh?
Is that what you want?

981
01:16:36.261 --> 01:16:38.229
'Cause these guys
really wanna shoot you.

982
01:16:38.330 --> 01:16:40.890
And the way you're acting,
they'll be completely fucking justified.

983
01:16:40.999 --> 01:16:42.227
Fuck you!

984
01:16:42.334 --> 01:16:45.633
Fuck me? I'm not the one who's fucked here.
You're the one.

985
01:16:45.770 --> 01:16:48.637
'Cause you're the one
whose head's gonna be blown off!

986
01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:50.002
Officer Hanson, step away.

987
01:16:50.108 --> 01:16:53.566
He's a friend of mine, okay? He's a fucking
friend! This man is not armed!

988
01:16:53.712 --> 01:16:56.613
He's not gonna shoot you, me,
or anybody else, all right?

989
01:16:56.715 --> 01:16:58.740
So give me two goddamn seconds.
Can you do that?

990
01:16:58.850 --> 01:17:02.115
Lower your firearm.
Lower your firearm!

991
01:17:07.325 --> 01:17:10.590
You startin' to understand
the situation?

992
01:17:10.695 --> 01:17:13.357
What do you want from me?

993
01:17:13.465 --> 01:17:17.993
Unless you think your wife is better off with
a husband who has a bloody stump for a head,

994
01:17:18.136 --> 01:17:20.036
I want you to sit on that curb,
put your hands on your head

995
01:17:20.138 --> 01:17:22.368
and do nothing until I speak with these officers.

996
01:17:22.474 --> 01:17:25.443
I'm not sittin' on no curb, I'm not puttin'
my hands on my head for nobody.

997
01:17:25.577 --> 01:17:29.570
Then stand where you are and keep your
hands in sight. Can you do that, huh?

998
01:17:32.651 --> 01:17:34.812
Yeah, I can do that.

999
01:17:34.919 --> 01:17:37.149
Good.

1000
01:17:37.255 --> 01:17:41.055
I told this man to stay where he is and keep his
hands in plain sight.

1001
01:17:41.159 --> 01:17:45.926
This man better be related to you by blood
because this is fucking nuts.

1002
01:17:46.031 --> 01:17:48.124
I need this favor.

1003
01:17:48.233 --> 01:17:52.260
You can check the guy's name, his license.
He's got no priors, no warrants.

1004
01:17:52.404 --> 01:17:54.929
I need to let him go
with a warning.

1005
01:17:55.073 --> 01:17:59.942
- What kind of fucking warning?
- A harsh warning.

1006
01:18:02.514 --> 01:18:04.379
Thank you.

1007
01:18:07.252 --> 01:18:11.279
You've been warned. Do you understand me?
Do you understand me!

1008
01:18:11.389 --> 01:18:14.654
You want something from me?
'Cause I'm right here.

1009
01:18:14.759 --> 01:18:18.786
- I'm trying to help you.
- I didn't ask for your help, did I?

1010
01:18:20.932 --> 01:18:23.127
Go home.

1011
01:18:26.805 --> 01:18:29.137
Yeah, that I can do.

1012
01:19:47.719 --> 01:19:49.619
Look at me.

1013
01:19:51.089 --> 01:19:53.751
You embarrass me.

1014
01:19:53.858 --> 01:19:55.951
You embarrass yourself.

1015
01:20:39.137 --> 01:20:40.104
Daddy's home!

1016
01:21:00.959 --> 01:21:02.017
- What's up?
- Give me my money!

1017
01:21:02.126 --> 01:21:04.560
- What? What money?
- Daddy!

1018
01:21:04.662 --> 01:21:07.927
- To pay for my store. Give me my money!
- Honey, stay inside. Elizabeth!

1019
01:21:08.032 --> 01:21:09.522
Give me my money!

1020
01:21:11.102 --> 01:21:14.162
- I want my fucking money! Give me that truck!
- That's not my truck!

1021
01:21:14.305 --> 01:21:16.637
- Daddy?
- Elizabeth!

1022
01:21:16.741 --> 01:21:21.007
Hey, you know what?
Hey, I got $50. Here.

1023
01:21:21.112 --> 01:21:23.171
Fifty dollars?
You took everything!

1024
01:21:23.281 --> 01:21:23.940
Mommy?

1025
01:21:25.717 --> 01:21:27.309
I'm coming, I'm coming!

1026
01:21:27.418 --> 01:21:31.616
- He doesn't have it.
- Hasn't got what?

1027
01:21:31.723 --> 01:21:35.955
I have it. He doesn't
have the impenetrable cloak!

1028
01:21:37.161 --> 01:21:38.788
Lara, stay outta the street!

1029
01:22:06.424 --> 01:22:10.087
- It's okay, Daddy.
- What... What?

1030
01:22:10.194 --> 01:22:11.627
I'll protect you.

1031
01:22:38.923 --> 01:22:41.585
It's okay. Daddy's okay.

1032
01:22:41.693 --> 01:22:44.719
It's a really good cloak.

1033
01:23:51.796 --> 01:23:56.756
I sent her out for groceries,
and that was two hours ago, Carol.

1034
01:23:56.901 --> 01:23:58.766
Well, you are one to talk.

1035
01:23:58.870 --> 01:24:02.738
You go through, like,
six housekeepers a year?

1036
01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:06.241
I'm not snapping at you!
I am angry.

1037
01:24:07.512 --> 01:24:09.571
Yes! At them! Yes!

1038
01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:14.014
At them, the police,
at Rick, at Maria,

1039
01:24:14.118 --> 01:24:17.815
at the dry cleaners who destroyed
another blouse today,

1040
01:24:17.922 --> 01:24:21.881
at the gardener who keeps
overwatering the lawn.

1041
01:24:21.993 --> 01:24:23.153
I...

1042
01:24:24.395 --> 01:24:26.920
I just thought that...

1043
01:24:27.031 --> 01:24:30.558
Carol, I just thought that
I would wake up today

1044
01:24:30.701 --> 01:24:33.670
and I would feel better, you know?

1045
01:24:33.771 --> 01:24:37.730
But I was still mad.
And I realized...

1046
01:24:37.875 --> 01:24:41.777
I realized that it had nothing
to do with my car being stolen.

1047
01:24:43.815 --> 01:24:47.581
I wake up like this
every morning!

1048
01:24:47.685 --> 01:24:51.644
I am angry all the time,
and I don't know why.

1049
01:24:51.756 --> 01:24:55.089
Carol, I don't know why! And I...

1050
01:24:56.761 --> 01:24:59.821
Yeah, yeah, call me back.

1051
01:24:59.931 --> 01:25:01.796
Bye.

1052
01:26:52.977 --> 01:26:54.945
Really appreciate this.

1053
01:26:55.046 --> 01:26:57.241
You're welcome.

1054
01:27:03.087 --> 01:27:04.987
So how long you been out there tonight?
It's cold.

1055
01:27:05.089 --> 01:27:07.216
Hour maybe.

1056
01:27:07.325 --> 01:27:09.122
Big surprise, huh?

1057
01:27:09.227 --> 01:27:12.492
Yeah, this ain't exactly
"pick up a brother" territory.

1058
01:27:12.597 --> 01:27:14.360
True.

1059
01:27:14.465 --> 01:27:16.433
So where you headed?

1060
01:27:16.567 --> 01:27:18.694
Anywhere the other side
of the hill.

1061
01:27:22.139 --> 01:27:24.403
That's some good music.

1062
01:27:24.508 --> 01:27:26.408
Mm-hmm.

1063
01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:29.911
No, really.
I'm startin' to understand it.

1064
01:27:30.014 --> 01:27:33.074
Wrote me a country song
myself just yesterday.

1065
01:27:33.184 --> 01:27:35.379
I'll bet you did.

1066
01:27:50.735 --> 01:27:52.965
So what was goin' on
in the Valley tonight?

1067
01:27:53.104 --> 01:27:54.731
Ice-skatin'.

1068
01:27:55.906 --> 01:27:56.930
Ice-skatin'.

1069
01:27:57.074 --> 01:27:59.634
Love the ice-skatin'.

1070
01:27:59.744 --> 01:28:03.373
When I was a kid,
I always wanted to be a goalie.

1071
01:28:03.481 --> 01:28:05.073
Come on!

1072
01:28:05.182 --> 01:28:08.447
What, you... you think
that's funny or somethin'?

1073
01:28:08.552 --> 01:28:10.577
I think you're having fun.

1074
01:28:10.688 --> 01:28:12.679
Yeah. Whatever.

1075
01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:23.467
Something else funny?

1076
01:28:23.601 --> 01:28:25.865
Oh, yeah.

1077
01:28:28.205 --> 01:28:30.002
Yeah? What's that?

1078
01:28:30.107 --> 01:28:31.870
People, man. People.

1079
01:28:33.044 --> 01:28:34.944
People like me.

1080
01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:39.071
No, no, no, no.
I'm not laughin' at you, man.

1081
01:28:40.084 --> 01:28:41.051
I can see that.

1082
01:28:41.152 --> 01:28:44.849
- Why don't you laugh outside?
- Why are you gettin' all bent outta shape?

1083
01:28:44.955 --> 01:28:47.685
I'm not gettin' bent, man.
Just pulling over.

1084
01:28:50.194 --> 01:28:54.290
Come on, man, keep drivin'.
I said I'm not laughing at you.

1085
01:28:54.398 --> 01:28:56.798
And I'm not telling you
to get the fuck out of my car.

1086
01:28:56.901 --> 01:28:59.461
Why you bein' a fucking jerk?
Just drive the car.

1087
01:28:59.603 --> 01:29:01.468
I've got a better idea.
Get out now.

1088
01:29:01.572 --> 01:29:03.164
Fine. You want me
to show you? I'll show you.

1089
01:29:03.307 --> 01:29:05.935
Get your hands out of your pocket.
Put your hands where I can see 'em.

1090
01:29:06.043 --> 01:29:08.034
- Who the fuck you think you're talkin' to?
- Put your hands where I can see!

1091
01:29:08.145 --> 01:29:11.046
You wanna see what's in my hands?
I'll show you what's in my fuckin' hands!

1092
01:29:47.284 --> 01:29:49.980
Oh, God.

1093
01:30:24.455 --> 01:30:28.858
<i>Thank you, Brother Merle</i>.
<i>That was Merle Haggard on KYHA</i>.

1094
01:30:28.959 --> 01:30:31.052
<i>The scene of country music</i>
<i>here in L. A</i>.

1095
01:30:31.162 --> 01:30:33.357
<i>It's a cold night,</i>
<i>and it's getting colder</i>.

1096
01:30:33.464 --> 01:30:37.457
<i>We're giving out tickets to the rodeo coming</i>
<i>to the Fairplex in Pomona</i>.

1097
01:30:41.038 --> 01:30:45.270
- Hey, you okay?
- I'm freezin'.

1098
01:30:45.376 --> 01:30:48.345
Shit. I heard it might snow.

1099
01:30:48.446 --> 01:30:50.778
- Get outta here.
- That's what I heard.

1100
01:30:50.881 --> 01:30:54.146
- You got a smoke?
- Nah. I quit.

1101
01:30:54.251 --> 01:30:56.412
Yeah, me too.

1102
01:30:56.520 --> 01:31:01.719
- What do you got?
- Dead kid.

1103
01:31:01.826 --> 01:31:04.317
Hey, Bob.

1104
01:32:31.415 --> 01:32:34.441
Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!

1105
01:32:34.552 --> 01:32:37.453
- Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!
- Do you speak English?

1106
01:32:37.555 --> 01:32:41.548
I am speaking English, you stupid cow!
My husband name Choi Jin Gui!

1107
01:32:43.794 --> 01:32:45.352
- Jin Gui!
- Ma'am!

1108
01:32:45.462 --> 01:32:48.659
Kim Lee.

1109
01:32:54.605 --> 01:32:58.735
I thought you were dead.
I called every hospital.

1110
01:32:58.842 --> 01:33:00.605
It's okay. I'm okay.

1111
01:33:00.711 --> 01:33:03.509
Thank you for finding me.

1112
01:33:06.216 --> 01:33:09.708
- Will you do something for me?
- Anything.

1113
01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:11.583
Go to the locker.

1114
01:33:15.793 --> 01:33:17.727
No, next one.

1115
01:33:20.798 --> 01:33:23.562
In my wallet, there's a check.

1116
01:33:23.701 --> 01:33:25.828
Bring it here.

1117
01:33:33.844 --> 01:33:37.075
Oh, I get it. When I said get me
a black Lincoln Navigator,

1118
01:33:37.181 --> 01:33:40.548
you thought I said get me
a white piece of shit panel van.

1119
01:33:40.651 --> 01:33:45.679
- Fine, fine. Just give me whatever for it.
- You should see this.

1120
01:34:01.739 --> 01:34:03.730
I'll take the van.

1121
01:34:04.808 --> 01:34:06.105
They're chained to the van.

1122
01:34:06.210 --> 01:34:07.802
So I'll take them too.

1123
01:34:09.246 --> 01:34:11.237
You wanna buy these Chinamen?

1124
01:34:11.348 --> 01:34:13.873
Don't be ignorant.
They're Thai or Cambodian.

1125
01:34:13.984 --> 01:34:15.713
Entirely different kind of chinks.

1126
01:34:15.819 --> 01:34:18.913
- What the hell are you gonna do with 'em?
- Sell 'em. What you think?

1127
01:34:19.023 --> 01:34:23.357
I'll give you 500 apiece,
and you can keep the van.

1128
01:34:41.512 --> 01:34:44.481
Oh, no!

1129
01:34:48.218 --> 01:34:50.482
No! No!

1130
01:35:06.603 --> 01:35:08.537
This is Dorri.

1131
01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:18.475
Oh.

1132
01:35:18.582 --> 01:35:20.914
Oh. Mmm, mmm, mmm.

1133
01:35:21.018 --> 01:35:25.216
My baby. My poor baby!

1134
01:35:27.491 --> 01:35:29.322
Mom.

1135
01:35:30.060 --> 01:35:34.724
I promise you... I promise I'm gonna
find out who did this, Mom.

1136
01:35:36.633 --> 01:35:39.397
Oh, I already know.

1137
01:35:41.405 --> 01:35:43.134
You did.

1138
01:35:45.476 --> 01:35:50.106
I asked you to find your brother,
but you were busy.

1139
01:35:50.214 --> 01:35:54.014
We weren't much good
to you anymore, were we?

1140
01:35:58.388 --> 01:36:01.357
You got things to do. You go ahead.
I'll sign the papers.

1141
01:36:01.458 --> 01:36:03.358
I wanna stay.

1142
01:36:03.460 --> 01:36:07.123
I just wanna wait
with my baby.

1143
01:36:17.841 --> 01:36:18.808
He came home.

1144
01:36:19.877 --> 01:36:21.811
Did you know that?

1145
01:36:21.912 --> 01:36:24.745
My little boy.

1146
01:36:24.848 --> 01:36:26.645
When I was sleepin',

1147
01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:29.810
he brought me groceries.

1148
01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:31.911
It's the last thing he did.

1149
01:37:11.228 --> 01:37:13.219
What happened?

1150
01:37:19.770 --> 01:37:21.635
What did you do?

1151
01:37:22.739 --> 01:37:25.264
What did you do?

1152
01:37:27.477 --> 01:37:29.411
I shoot a little girl.

1153
01:37:29.513 --> 01:37:31.743
What?

1154
01:37:31.849 --> 01:37:34.647
No, she's okay. She's...

1155
01:37:36.286 --> 01:37:38.516
She's... Here.

1156
01:37:38.622 --> 01:37:43.753
The gun shoot her,
but she's okay, Dorri.

1157
01:37:43.861 --> 01:37:46.853
Nothing happened.

1158
01:37:48.565 --> 01:37:49.793
She's my...

1159
01:37:51.468 --> 01:37:53.231
What are you
talking about, Daddy?

1160
01:37:57.007 --> 01:37:58.804
My angel.

1161
01:38:00.944 --> 01:38:02.878
My angel!

1162
01:38:04.681 --> 01:38:07.377
She came to protect me.

1163
01:38:08.685 --> 01:38:11.085
To protect us!

1164
01:38:12.823 --> 01:38:14.620
You understand?

1165
01:38:18.962 --> 01:38:20.987
Take this. Please.

1166
01:38:22.566 --> 01:38:24.466
Take it.

1167
01:38:28.872 --> 01:38:31.340
Hey! Hey!

1168
01:38:31.475 --> 01:38:35.104
Everything is okay, Dorri.

1169
01:38:35.212 --> 01:38:36.941
It's okay.

1170
01:38:41.985 --> 01:38:43.612
Okay, Daddy.

1171
01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:45.312
Okay.

1172
01:39:08.779 --> 01:39:09.746
Jean?

1173
01:39:09.846 --> 01:39:11.871
- <i>Rick?</i>
- Yeah. What's wrong.

1174
01:39:11.982 --> 01:39:14.610
I fell down the stairs.

1175
01:39:14.718 --> 01:39:18.051
- Are you all right?
- <i>I tried calling you</i>.

1176
01:39:18.155 --> 01:39:21.352
I couldn't get through
to anyone. Not...

1177
01:39:21.458 --> 01:39:24.894
Not Kath, not Marge, not Julie.

1178
01:39:24.995 --> 01:39:27.725
I'm getting in the elevator. I'll be in my car.
I'll be home in 20 minutes.

1179
01:39:27.831 --> 01:39:30.823
It's okay. Maria drove me to emergency.
It's just a bad sprain.

1180
01:39:30.968 --> 01:39:33.402
Carol was the only one
that was home and

1181
01:39:33.503 --> 01:39:37.132
she said she couldn't come get me because
she was getting a massage.

1182
01:39:37.274 --> 01:39:39.640
That's because she's a bitch.

1183
01:39:39.743 --> 01:39:42.610
She's been my friend for ten years.

1184
01:39:43.780 --> 01:39:45.680
<i>All right, honey</i>.
<i>Feel better</i>.

1185
01:39:45.782 --> 01:39:48.046
I'll be there soon.

1186
01:39:50.253 --> 01:39:52.153
I love you.

1187
01:39:52.255 --> 01:39:54.485
I love you too.

1188
01:40:16.747 --> 01:40:18.840
Miss Jean.

1189
01:40:20.884 --> 01:40:23.512
Would you like to sit up?

1190
01:40:29.192 --> 01:40:32.389
Here. Good!

1191
01:40:41.038 --> 01:40:43.199
Do you wanna hear
something funny?

1192
01:40:43.340 --> 01:40:45.274
What, Mrs. Jean?

1193
01:40:47.110 --> 01:40:49.840
You're the best friend I've got.

1194
01:44:03.974 --> 01:44:05.441
Hi.

1195
01:44:06.009 --> 01:44:07.772
Hi.

1196
01:44:13.316 --> 01:44:14.442
I love you.

1197
01:45:44.307 --> 01:45:46.207
All right.

1198
01:45:46.309 --> 01:45:49.574
Everybody out, man.
You're free to go.

1199
01:45:52.515 --> 01:45:54.813
All right, come on.

1200
01:45:54.918 --> 01:45:58.251
Come on now! This is America.
Time is money. Chop, chop!

1201
01:45:58.355 --> 01:45:59.947
Come on, y'all.

1202
01:46:03.259 --> 01:46:04.886
Come on.

1203
01:46:29.419 --> 01:46:31.444
That's $40.

1204
01:46:31.554 --> 01:46:34.546
Buy everybody chop suey.
You understand?

1205
01:46:35.959 --> 01:46:38.427
Dopey fucking Chinaman.

1206
01:47:09.459 --> 01:47:11.222
Aah! Oh, my God!

1207
01:47:11.327 --> 01:47:13.420
What the hell is wrong with you?

1208
01:47:15.131 --> 01:47:18.692
Uh-uh! Don't talk to me
unless you speak American!
