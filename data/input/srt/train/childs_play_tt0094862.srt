1
00:00:36,957 --> 00:00:38,892
I got the strangler!

2
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:40,894
Wabash and Van Buren!

3
00:01:08,889 --> 00:01:10,413
Oh, shit.

4
00:01:15,762 --> 00:01:17,059
Oh, shit!

5
00:01:17,331 --> 00:01:19,595
Jack, get the van.

6
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,996
Eddie, help me!

7
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,504
Eddie, don't leave me!
God, no!

8
00:01:41,921 --> 00:01:44,389
Give it up, Ray!
It's over!

9
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:07,971
Oh, God, I'm dying.

10
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:14,274
You hear this,
you son of a bitch?

11
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:18,748
I'm gonna get you for it!

12
00:03:20,552 --> 00:03:22,543
I'm gonna get you...

13
00:03:22,653 --> 00:03:24,645
and I'm gonna get Eddie...

14
00:03:24,723 --> 00:03:27,453
no matter what!

15
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:44,037
I gotta find somebody.

16
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:54,511
I don't know. I gotta find somebody.

17
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:41,064
Give me the power,
I beg of you!

18
00:06:23,632 --> 00:06:27,728
I have no friends.
No one will play with me.

19
00:06:27,836 --> 00:06:30,862
Uh-oh. There's a friend in need.

20
00:06:31,973 --> 00:06:33,634
Hey, cheer up.

21
00:06:33,742 --> 00:06:36,335
- Who are you?
- I'm a Good Guy.

22
00:06:36,444 --> 00:06:38,775
I've just come
from the Good Guy clubhouse...

23
00:06:38,846 --> 00:06:40,780
and I'll be your friend
to the end.

24
00:06:40,882 --> 00:06:45,341
You will?
You mean you'll be my friend now?

25
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,354
Sure, I will.

26
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:49,356
Hidey-ho.

27
00:06:50,424 --> 00:06:52,893
I saw this one.

28
00:07:13,347 --> 00:07:16,373
All right, Good Guys,
that's our ''Good Guy Show'' for today...

29
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:17,745
but don't go away...

30
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:20,911
because we've got a very important
Good Guy message...

31
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:23,421
just for you.

32
00:07:25,326 --> 00:07:28,955
Hi, Good Guys.
Boy, have I got news for you.

33
00:07:29,063 --> 00:07:32,430
Now you can have your very own
Good Guy doll.

34
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:34,899
That's right.
You can have all the adventures...

35
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:37,994
we have on TV
in your very own home.

36
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:41,399
Good Guys say
three different sentences.

37
00:07:41,508 --> 00:07:45,239
We even turn our heads
and blink our eyes when you talk to us.

38
00:07:45,345 --> 00:07:46,573
Right, Oscar?

39
00:07:47,614 --> 00:07:50,275
Hi, I'm Oscar,
and I'm your friend to the end.

40
00:07:50,383 --> 00:07:51,976
Hidey-ho!

41
00:07:53,587 --> 00:07:55,383
Wow!

42
00:07:55,489 --> 00:07:58,424
Every Good Guy has a name
all his own...

43
00:07:58,524 --> 00:08:01,584
so he can be
your very own best friend.

44
00:08:01,695 --> 00:08:05,562
So remember to tell Mom and Dad
you want a Good Guy.

45
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:09,625
Perfect for birthdays
or just any old time.

46
00:08:09,736 --> 00:08:11,966
And remember, you can buy...

47
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:15,366
all our Good Guy accessories too.

48
00:08:15,475 --> 00:08:17,841
- Right, Oscar?
- Right.

49
00:08:19,545 --> 00:08:22,013
Brought to you exclusively
by Play Pals...

50
00:08:22,281 --> 00:08:24,010
makers of Good Guys
and other fine toys.

51
00:08:24,283 --> 00:08:27,912
Found in toy stores
throughout the greater Chicago area.

52
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:34,424
Mommy, wake up!

53
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:59,517
- What time is it, Andy?
- Wake up.

54
00:08:59,584 --> 00:09:01,745
It's only 6:30 in the morning.

55
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:09,885
But it's a beautiful day outside.
See?

56
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:14,930
It certainly is.
How long you been up, birthday boy?

57
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:17,433
Since forever.

58
00:09:17,536 --> 00:09:20,562
I made you breakfast in bed.

59
00:09:20,672 --> 00:09:23,266
You did? Oh, God.

60
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,605
Well, thanks.

61
00:09:25,677 --> 00:09:28,612
Well, this looks just excellent.

62
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,281
I'll tell you what.

63
00:09:33,351 --> 00:09:35,945
Why don't I eat this
just a little later, okay?

64
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:41,815
But first I gotta give you
your super-duper birthday tummy-gummy.

65
00:09:41,926 --> 00:09:44,394
Come here. Come here.

66
00:09:47,065 --> 00:09:50,432
That's one. How many years
old are you today? Two.

67
00:09:50,535 --> 00:09:52,695
Happy birthday, pumpkin.

68
00:09:52,804 --> 00:09:56,671
Thanks. Can we open
my presents now, Mommy?

69
00:09:56,774 --> 00:09:59,766
- Yes, we can.
- Terrific!

70
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,009
Good morning, Chicago.
Leading off at this hour...

71
00:10:04,082 --> 00:10:06,744
Charles Lee Ray,
the notorious Lake Shore Strangler...

72
00:10:06,851 --> 00:10:11,049
was shot and killed shortly before 3:00
a.m. this morning on Wabash Avenue.

73
00:10:11,322 --> 00:10:14,450
Can I open this first, Mommy?

74
00:10:14,558 --> 00:10:17,460
Andy, don't you want to start
with the smaller one first?

75
00:10:19,364 --> 00:10:21,263
Okay, go ahead.

76
00:10:27,304 --> 00:10:30,831
Well, what do you think?
You need these clothes so badly.

77
00:10:30,941 --> 00:10:34,775
I think they're gonna be okay.
We'll just take them up a couple inches.

78
00:10:38,081 --> 00:10:40,846
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

79
00:10:41,785 --> 00:10:43,843
I know.
You want some toys, don't you?

80
00:10:43,954 --> 00:10:45,854
Not boring old clothes.

81
00:10:47,925 --> 00:10:49,085
Try the other one.

82
00:10:53,497 --> 00:10:55,522
What do you think?

83
00:10:55,632 --> 00:10:57,897
I want a Good Guy to go with it.

84
00:10:58,001 --> 00:11:01,062
I know you do, Andy,
but I didn't know about it...

85
00:11:01,338 --> 00:11:03,396
in time this month
to save up for it.

86
00:11:11,882 --> 00:11:13,713
- Karen.
- Hi.

87
00:11:13,816 --> 00:11:17,446
You know that doll you wanted
for Andy? It cost 100 bucks.

88
00:11:17,554 --> 00:11:20,785
There was a peddler in the alley behind
the store and I think he's got one.

89
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:24,758
- Why would a peddler have a doll?
- Grab your purse. We can get a deal.

90
00:11:24,861 --> 00:11:27,386
- I can't leave.
- Do you want it or not?

91
00:11:27,497 --> 00:11:30,624
- Of course.
- Then come on.

92
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,770
There he is.

93
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:41,608
Okay, show her.

94
00:11:43,646 --> 00:11:45,977
Well, is it a Good Guy or not?

95
00:11:47,116 --> 00:11:48,777
It is.

96
00:11:48,884 --> 00:11:51,513
- Well, I told you.
- How much do you want?

97
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,851
- Fifty bucks.
- Ten and not a penny more.

98
00:11:53,956 --> 00:11:56,289
- Thirty.
- That thing is not worth thirty.

99
00:11:56,392 --> 00:11:58,791
Take it or leave it.
Somebody else will buy it.

100
00:11:58,894 --> 00:12:00,919
- Take it.
- It's too much money.

101
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,521
No, it isn't. You have no idea
how much Andy wants this doll.

102
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:06,260
- But we don't know if it works.
- Here you go, lady.

103
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:08,893
- May it bring you and your kid joy.
- Thank you.

104
00:12:09,005 --> 00:12:10,768
Hold on, you!

105
00:12:10,872 --> 00:12:13,602
How do we know the damn thing
isn't stolen?

106
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:16,735
- Steal this!
- Steal this yourself.

107
00:12:16,846 --> 00:12:19,643
- Maggie.
- I think I dated him.

108
00:12:19,715 --> 00:12:22,741
Come on. We gotta get back to work.

109
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,722
Andy's going to love it!

110
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,588
Nice of you to drop by.
Have a nice break?

111
00:12:31,693 --> 00:12:34,491
- Sorry. I was only gone for a minute.
- Have a heart, Criswell.

112
00:12:34,596 --> 00:12:37,030
We were downstairs buying her little boy
a birthday present.

113
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,359
We have specified break times
for activities like that.

114
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:44,404
Mrs. Howe is sick and we're shorthanded
tonight. You have to fill in.

115
00:12:44,506 --> 00:12:47,066
I can't. I have to pick up my son
at the day care.

116
00:12:47,342 --> 00:12:49,867
- This is an emergency.
- I'll take over for her.

117
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:53,880
Miss Peterson, you work in shoes,
not in jewelry.

118
00:12:53,948 --> 00:12:58,612
You'll have to do it. You can take off
at 5:00 but be back at 7:00.

119
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,516
It's my son's birthday.

120
00:13:00,622 --> 00:13:02,988
Are you happy with your job?

121
00:13:03,091 --> 00:13:04,489
Yes, I am.

122
00:13:04,592 --> 00:13:06,458
Then I suggest--

123
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,393
Chill out, would you, Walter?

124
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,330
- I'll take care of Andy.
- You can't do it again.

125
00:13:12,434 --> 00:13:15,402
Don't be silly. It'll be
the hottest date I've had in months.

126
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,563
I can't imagine why.

127
00:13:26,781 --> 00:13:30,273
- Where are you going?
- ''Good Guys'' are on TV.

128
00:13:30,384 --> 00:13:32,545
I may have something
better for you.

129
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,019
What?

130
00:13:36,424 --> 00:13:37,857
This isn't groceries.

131
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,568
A Good Guy! I knew it!

132
00:13:54,675 --> 00:13:56,642
I knew you'd get me one!

133
00:13:56,743 --> 00:13:58,336
Show me how he works.

134
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:02,674
Hi, I'm Andy.
What's your name?

135
00:14:04,017 --> 00:14:07,351
Hi, I'm Chucky,
and I'm your friend to the end.

136
00:14:07,454 --> 00:14:09,388
Hidey-ho.

137
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:13,659
Wow! He's something, isn't he?

138
00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:15,751
Oh, Mom, thanks.

139
00:14:17,965 --> 00:14:20,558
You're welcome, honey.

140
00:14:39,486 --> 00:14:43,047
- See, that's how you build things.
- WDOL with a late-breaking report.

141
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:46,315
Eddie Caputo,
accomplice of Charles Lee Ray...

142
00:14:46,425 --> 00:14:48,394
has just escaped
the Michigan Avenue Precinct.

143
00:14:48,495 --> 00:14:51,828
More details to follow
on the news at 9:00 next.

144
00:14:55,402 --> 00:14:58,838
Hey, Chucky,
you're not watching me.

145
00:15:01,408 --> 00:15:03,376
Hey, want to play?

146
00:15:03,442 --> 00:15:05,308
Time for bed, Andy.

147
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,374
Come on, Chucky. We have to
get ready to go to bed.

148
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,660
Aunt Maggie,
Chucky wants to watch...

149
00:15:24,764 --> 00:15:27,926
the 9:00 news.

150
00:15:28,034 --> 00:15:29,660
Sure he does.

151
00:15:32,504 --> 00:15:34,495
Okay, kid, off we go.

152
00:15:34,606 --> 00:15:36,801
Come on. There we go.

153
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,841
- Chucky.
- Oh, yes, Chucky.

154
00:15:42,981 --> 00:15:45,609
You too. Off we go.

155
00:15:48,487 --> 00:15:52,753
Now it's brush your teeth
and under the covers with you.

156
00:15:54,526 --> 00:15:56,653
Okay? Agreed?

157
00:15:56,761 --> 00:15:58,627
Good.

158
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,960
You yell when you're ready
for me to tuck you in.

159
00:16:03,969 --> 00:16:07,597
Hey, Chucky,
want to see my room?

160
00:16:22,888 --> 00:16:25,379
Andy, are you
brushing your teeth?

161
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,924
Yes, Aunt Maggie!

162
00:16:28,025 --> 00:16:30,290
Good.

163
00:16:36,902 --> 00:16:39,393
And now, Action News at 9:00.

164
00:16:41,038 --> 00:16:43,836
In Washington today,
the mayor replied...

165
00:16:43,941 --> 00:16:47,377
that he would study
the congressional findings carefully...

166
00:16:47,478 --> 00:16:51,505
and have the commission on gang-related
violence issue recommendations to him.

167
00:16:51,582 --> 00:16:53,607
Back to you, Steve.

168
00:16:53,718 --> 00:16:55,618
Thank you, Terry.

169
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:58,416
Police have now clarified
the information...

170
00:16:58,523 --> 00:17:00,423
regarding the escape
of Eddie Caputo.

171
00:17:00,525 --> 00:17:02,584
Caputo eluded his captors...

172
00:17:02,693 --> 00:17:05,923
while being transferred onto
a prison bus on his way to court.

173
00:17:14,505 --> 00:17:17,473
Okay, mister, what do you
have to say about this?

174
00:17:17,574 --> 00:17:20,475
- About what?
- Come on.

175
00:17:22,012 --> 00:17:26,416
You know, you have to learn
that when I say something, I mean it.

176
00:17:26,517 --> 00:17:29,917
- But what did I do?
- You know what I'm talking about.

177
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,546
Turning the TV on
and putting Chucky in front of it...

178
00:17:32,622 --> 00:17:35,022
when I told you
it was time to go to bed.

179
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:37,693
- I didn't do that.
- No? What did Chucky do?

180
00:17:37,794 --> 00:17:40,592
Walk into the living room
and turn it on by himself?

181
00:17:40,698 --> 00:17:42,756
Did you do that, Chucky?

182
00:17:42,866 --> 00:17:45,494
Andy, stop it!
Under the covers! Hurry.

183
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:51,006
- But Aunt--
- Under the covers and not another word.

184
00:17:51,274 --> 00:17:54,607
But I didn't put Chucky
in front of the TV.

185
00:17:54,711 --> 00:17:57,874
Shh. Enough. Okay?

186
00:17:57,981 --> 00:17:59,538
Give me a kiss.

187
00:17:59,649 --> 00:18:02,675
Good night, baby,
and happy birthday.

188
00:18:02,785 --> 00:18:04,720
Good night, Aunt Maggie.

189
00:18:21,471 --> 00:18:25,907
I told you she'd be mad at you
if you watched the news.

190
00:20:19,954 --> 00:20:21,854
Andy, is that you?

191
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,479
How did that happen?

192
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:01,644
Hello?

193
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:04,746
Hi. How's it going?
How's Andy?

194
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:08,315
- Karen?
- Who else? Is something wrong?

195
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,796
No.

196
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,862
Everything's fine.

197
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:18,562
You don't sound
like everything's fine.

198
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:23,334
I just had a bit of
the alone-at-night willies.

199
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:26,003
Now, would you
stop worrying and...

200
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,911
give Criswell
a kick in the pants for me.

201
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:31,873
You got it.

202
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,749
Listen. Thank you for everything.
You're a real pal.

203
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,015
Oh, yeah?

204
00:22:37,288 --> 00:22:41,919
Yeah. Give Andy a kiss for me.
See you soon. Bye.

205
00:23:19,997 --> 00:23:22,488
What is wrong with me?

206
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,999
I'm scaring myself
half to death.

207
00:23:55,098 --> 00:23:56,929
Get away from this barricade.

208
00:23:57,034 --> 00:24:00,003
Move it back.
There's nothing to see.

209
00:24:00,103 --> 00:24:04,506
Let's move this police line back.
Go on home, folks, please.

210
00:24:15,285 --> 00:24:18,220
She was on the sixth floor.

211
00:24:28,632 --> 00:24:30,532
Whoa, miss!
What are you doing?

212
00:24:30,634 --> 00:24:32,362
I live here.

213
00:24:48,485 --> 00:24:50,281
Mommy!

214
00:24:50,387 --> 00:24:52,013
Oh, thank God.

215
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,882
Are you all right?

216
00:24:54,991 --> 00:24:57,551
I'm so glad.
I got so scared when--

217
00:24:57,661 --> 00:25:00,254
What's wrong? Where's Maggie?

218
00:25:00,363 --> 00:25:04,300
- She had an accident.
- What kind of an accident?

219
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,426
Mrs. Barclay,
I'm Detective Mike Norris, homicide.

220
00:25:07,536 --> 00:25:09,629
Could I talk to you
out in the hall?

221
00:25:09,739 --> 00:25:12,503
- Why? What's happened to Maggie?
- Please.

222
00:25:14,877 --> 00:25:16,811
I'll be right back.

223
00:25:24,787 --> 00:25:26,550
Look, Mrs. Barclay--

224
00:25:33,829 --> 00:25:35,558
What?

225
00:25:35,663 --> 00:25:38,633
- Miss Peterson's dead, Mrs. Barclay.
- What?

226
00:25:41,604 --> 00:25:45,370
- How?
- She fell from your kitchen window.

227
00:25:45,473 --> 00:25:47,532
- No!
- Whoa.

228
00:25:48,911 --> 00:25:50,502
You all right?

229
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:52,876
Yes.

230
00:25:52,947 --> 00:25:54,575
Come on.

231
00:26:11,733 --> 00:26:13,963
Do you got any idea
what these are?

232
00:26:19,542 --> 00:26:21,008
No.

233
00:26:21,275 --> 00:26:24,245
They look like footprints,
don't they? Very small footprints.

234
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,441
- What are you implying?
- I don't know.

235
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:32,019
What would Andy be doing
up on the counter, right?

236
00:26:32,287 --> 00:26:36,382
I already checked his closet.
None of his shoes matched these prints.

237
00:26:36,491 --> 00:26:37,890
Mommy?

238
00:26:39,494 --> 00:26:42,429
Chucky wanted to know
what was going on.

239
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,964
I want you to go to bed.
We are very busy.

240
00:26:45,033 --> 00:26:48,297
- But Mom--
- Right now, please.

241
00:26:51,506 --> 00:26:53,235
What's on your feet?

242
00:26:53,341 --> 00:26:56,673
Good Guy pj sneakers.

243
00:26:56,778 --> 00:26:59,712
Wow. Come here.

244
00:27:01,783 --> 00:27:05,240
- Can I see the bottoms of them?
- Sure.

245
00:27:05,352 --> 00:27:08,879
Look at this. There's a gun.
Is that a cowboy hat?

246
00:27:08,989 --> 00:27:12,390
Andy, get into bed.
I'll be in to tuck you in.

247
00:27:12,459 --> 00:27:14,893
- But Mom--
- Right now!

248
00:27:18,932 --> 00:27:21,627
Why are you treating Andy
like this?

249
00:27:21,735 --> 00:27:25,364
If he says he doesn't know how those
footprints got there, then he doesn't.

250
00:27:25,472 --> 00:27:28,464
Look, somebody made those footprints.
If not Andy, then who?

251
00:27:28,575 --> 00:27:30,543
I don't know
and I don't care.

252
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:33,409
I've just lost my best friend
to a horrible accident...

253
00:27:33,513 --> 00:27:37,540
and I would like some time alone with
my son who I'm sure is just as upset.

254
00:27:37,618 --> 00:27:39,812
I'm sorry.

255
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,013
I'll clear everybody out of here
right away.

256
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,952
Hey, guys, you done?
Let's go.

257
00:27:46,058 --> 00:27:48,549
Let's go, everybody.
Out of here!

258
00:27:58,005 --> 00:28:00,495
What do you think
was so important...

259
00:28:00,574 --> 00:28:03,236
about my sneakers, Chucky?

260
00:28:03,342 --> 00:28:06,676
You don't know either, do you?

261
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:28,429
Let me know if you find anything out
about those footprints.

262
00:28:31,737 --> 00:28:34,535
I know who was
on the kitchen counter.

263
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,870
- Who, Andy?
- Chucky!

264
00:28:37,977 --> 00:28:39,467
Your doll?

265
00:28:40,646 --> 00:28:44,945
That's enough stories for tonight.
Back to bed. I mean it!

266
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:52,790
Good night, detective.

267
00:28:55,961 --> 00:28:57,861
- What?
- Are you going to call me?

268
00:28:57,963 --> 00:29:01,832
- You don't give up, do you?
- I just-- I hate loose ends.

269
00:29:01,901 --> 00:29:04,369
And I hate people
who don't know when stop.

270
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:09,333
- Ouch. A spirited lady.
- No kidding.

271
00:29:09,442 --> 00:29:12,535
I want that autopsy report
first thing tomorrow...

272
00:29:12,644 --> 00:29:15,375
and anything you can find out
about the Barclays.

273
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,176
You got it! Anything else?

274
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:21,777
Yeah. Here.
Get this to the lab.

275
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:23,786
I found it in the corner
of the kitchen.

276
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:26,516
- What is this?
- Possible murder weapon.

277
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,723
Come on. You're kidding me.

278
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:34,559
Hey, you are kidding me,
aren't you?

279
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:04,626
Who are you talking to?

280
00:30:04,696 --> 00:30:06,788
Chucky.

281
00:30:17,908 --> 00:30:19,240
Chucky, huh?

282
00:30:19,343 --> 00:30:21,710
Yeah, sure, Chucky.

283
00:30:21,812 --> 00:30:24,372
He's sitting right over there.

284
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:30,520
Chucky's been talking to you too,
hasn't he?

285
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:33,647
- What's he been saying?
- All kinds of things.

286
00:30:33,757 --> 00:30:37,716
His real name
is Charles Lee Ray...

287
00:30:37,828 --> 00:30:41,628
and he's been sent down
from heaven by Daddy...

288
00:30:41,732 --> 00:30:43,893
to play with me.

289
00:30:47,738 --> 00:30:50,969
He has, has he?
Anything else?

290
00:30:51,074 --> 00:30:54,704
Yes. He said Aunt Maggie
was a real bitch...

291
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:57,508
and got what she deserved.

292
00:30:57,613 --> 00:31:01,515
Andy, how can you say
something so horrible?

293
00:31:01,617 --> 00:31:03,609
I didn't say it. Chucky did.

294
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,556
Andy, stop it. You know perfectly well
that you're making this up!

295
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:12,390
But I'm not. Chucky's alive.
Really, he is.

296
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,930
Chucky-- Chucky's a doll.

297
00:31:15,032 --> 00:31:17,431
He's made of plastic
and stuffing.

298
00:31:17,533 --> 00:31:20,696
Look at him.
Does he look like anything else?

299
00:31:20,803 --> 00:31:22,771
Don't, you'll hurt him.

300
00:31:22,872 --> 00:31:24,864
Andy, look!

301
00:31:24,974 --> 00:31:28,034
You don't really think
that Chucky is alive, do you?

302
00:31:28,311 --> 00:31:29,608
But he is.

303
00:31:29,712 --> 00:31:32,840
Andy, stop it! Please!

304
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:38,514
It's 'cause of Aunt Maggie
you're yelling at me, isn't it?

305
00:31:41,557 --> 00:31:44,856
Yes. Yes, I guess it is.

306
00:31:44,961 --> 00:31:46,952
I'm sorry.

307
00:31:47,063 --> 00:31:50,294
I'll stop making up stories.

308
00:31:55,071 --> 00:31:56,971
Thanks, champ.

309
00:31:58,407 --> 00:32:00,500
Do you want to sleep
in with me tonight?

310
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,373
No, it's all right.

311
00:32:02,477 --> 00:32:05,605
I've got Chucky.

312
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,651
Come on, into bed.

313
00:32:15,757 --> 00:32:17,657
Good night, sweetheart.

314
00:32:19,661 --> 00:32:21,289
I love you.

315
00:32:27,469 --> 00:32:28,663
Bye-bye.

316
00:32:37,612 --> 00:32:42,015
You're right, Chucky.
She didn't believe me.

317
00:32:48,723 --> 00:32:51,020
Hi. I like to be hugged.

318
00:32:51,091 --> 00:32:55,995
Good. I'd love to hug you too.

319
00:33:10,412 --> 00:33:12,880
You sure you're all right
about last night?

320
00:33:12,981 --> 00:33:15,609
No bad dreams
about Aunt Maggie?

321
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,947
And Chucky's only a doll, right?

322
00:33:21,323 --> 00:33:23,483
Off to school then.
I love you tons.

323
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,830
43rd street.
Next stop, 47th.

324
00:35:34,319 --> 00:35:36,787
Is that Eddie's?

325
00:35:40,692 --> 00:35:45,220
Look, you stay here.
I have to go tinkle.

326
00:35:55,307 --> 00:35:57,934
I'll be right there, Chucky!

327
00:39:07,362 --> 00:39:11,559
- Mrs. Barclay?
- I came as soon as I got your message.

328
00:39:11,667 --> 00:39:14,261
You haven't picked up your son
from school?

329
00:39:14,368 --> 00:39:18,566
- I came directly from work. Why?
- Let's go into my office.

330
00:39:18,674 --> 00:39:21,665
- Is something wrong with Andy?
- Please.

331
00:39:29,383 --> 00:39:32,580
- I don't know how to tell you this.
- Tell me what?

332
00:39:32,653 --> 00:39:36,453
Do you have any idea why your
Aunt Maggie fell out of that window?

333
00:39:36,557 --> 00:39:39,993
- Yes.
- Could you tell me why?

334
00:39:40,261 --> 00:39:44,925
'Cause she saw Chucky and
it scared her so much, she fell out.

335
00:39:45,032 --> 00:39:46,294
She did, huh?

336
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,200
So why did Chucky
go to see Eddie Caputo?

337
00:39:50,271 --> 00:39:51,829
Mommy!

338
00:39:57,245 --> 00:39:59,441
All right, sweetheart.
Come on.

339
00:40:01,716 --> 00:40:03,650
Now listen to me, okay?

340
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:08,446
Nobody believes you about Chucky.

341
00:40:08,556 --> 00:40:12,652
Unless you start telling the truth
right now...

342
00:40:12,727 --> 00:40:15,287
they're going to
take you away from me.

343
00:40:18,032 --> 00:40:19,659
You hear that, Chucky?

344
00:40:19,767 --> 00:40:23,794
They're taking me away
unless you say something.

345
00:40:25,705 --> 00:40:29,005
Please, say something.

346
00:40:29,277 --> 00:40:31,768
Come on, Chucky!
Say something!

347
00:40:31,878 --> 00:40:35,644
Tell me why you lied to me
about everything.

348
00:40:35,715 --> 00:40:38,879
Come on, Chucky!
Say something!

349
00:40:38,985 --> 00:40:40,646
Tell me!

350
00:40:40,755 --> 00:40:45,054
Hi! I'm Chucky and
I'm your friend to the end. Hidey-ho.

351
00:40:47,828 --> 00:40:50,625
Mommy, he's doing it on purpose!

352
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:55,394
He told me never to tell about him
or he'd kill me.

353
00:40:55,502 --> 00:40:59,268
Mrs. Barclay, my name is Dr. Ardmore.
I'm from County General.

354
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:01,432
I've seen more than enough.

355
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:04,669
Maybe Andy should spend
a couple of days with us.

356
00:41:42,549 --> 00:41:46,280
Well, say something,
you little bastard.

357
00:41:47,953 --> 00:41:50,251
Say something, damn it!

358
00:41:51,757 --> 00:41:53,851
Hi. I like to be hugged.

359
00:42:35,768 --> 00:42:38,328
"He wants you
for a best friend."

360
00:42:38,437 --> 00:42:39,995
Yeah, sure.

361
00:43:38,596 --> 00:43:41,394
Hi. I'm Chucky!
Want to play?

362
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,356
Talk to me.

363
00:44:47,563 --> 00:44:49,464
Come on, talk!

364
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,463
I said talk to me, damn it!
All right!

365
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:56,936
Then I'm going to make you talk!

366
00:45:08,484 --> 00:45:11,818
Talk to me,
or I'll throw you in the fire!

367
00:45:11,887 --> 00:45:15,220
You stupid bitch!
You filthy slut!

368
00:45:15,324 --> 00:45:17,519
I'll teach you
to fuck with me!

369
00:45:57,433 --> 00:45:58,899
Stop!

370
00:46:51,753 --> 00:46:53,687
Detective Norris!

371
00:46:53,755 --> 00:46:56,382
- What are you doing back here?
- Andy was telling the truth.

372
00:46:56,491 --> 00:47:00,551
- Chucky is alive and killed Caputo.
- What?

373
00:47:00,662 --> 00:47:04,962
I was about to throw away the box
he came in when the batteries fell out.

374
00:47:05,232 --> 00:47:08,862
Don't you see? He's been moving
and talking without any batteries.

375
00:47:08,936 --> 00:47:12,770
- What are you talking about?
- How I found out the doll is alive.

376
00:47:12,873 --> 00:47:15,308
I threatened
to throw him into the fireplace...

377
00:47:15,409 --> 00:47:17,877
when all of a sudden,
he came alive.

378
00:47:17,978 --> 00:47:20,344
I dropped him, and he ran out
of the apartment.

379
00:47:21,849 --> 00:47:23,782
Good night, Mrs. Barclay.

380
00:47:23,851 --> 00:47:26,614
Wait a minute!
I am telling you the truth!

381
00:47:26,687 --> 00:47:32,182
- He killed Maggie and Caputo.
- Look, I sympathize with you.

382
00:47:32,292 --> 00:47:35,352
I hated what happened in there today,
but lying is--

383
00:47:35,462 --> 00:47:38,989
Lying? Does this look
like I'm lying?

384
00:47:39,266 --> 00:47:41,666
- How did you get those?
- Chucky bit me.

385
00:47:41,767 --> 00:47:44,760
Oh, for God's sake!

386
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:46,770
All right, don't believe me!

387
00:47:47,841 --> 00:47:50,240
- Where you goin'?
- To find Chucky!

388
00:47:50,344 --> 00:47:52,311
How you gonna do that?

389
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:54,777
I'll start with the peddler
I bought him from.

390
00:47:54,847 --> 00:47:59,308
That isn't a good part of town!
You hear me?

391
00:47:59,385 --> 00:48:02,355
You don't want to go down there
at this time of night.

392
00:48:06,827 --> 00:48:08,852
Goddamn it!

393
00:49:23,668 --> 00:49:25,568
What's she doin' here?

394
00:49:29,608 --> 00:49:31,507
Hey, excuse me.

395
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:33,941
Mister!

396
00:49:37,348 --> 00:49:40,647
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Do you remember me?

397
00:49:40,718 --> 00:49:44,484
I bought a doll from you in back of
Carson's department store yesterday.

398
00:49:44,589 --> 00:49:46,682
- Doll?
- A Good Guy doll.

399
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:50,227
- You sold it to me. Do you remember?
- What about it?

400
00:49:50,328 --> 00:49:53,388
- Where did you get it?
- What will you give me if I tell you?

401
00:49:53,498 --> 00:49:57,867
I don't have much.
You're welcome to whatever I have.

402
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:04,767
It's not enough.
What else you got?

403
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:07,708
- That's all I've got.
- All you got?

404
00:50:07,811 --> 00:50:10,576
- What are you-- Yes.
- That's not all you got.

405
00:50:10,682 --> 00:50:13,412
- Wait a minute.
- No, you got a lot.

406
00:50:14,885 --> 00:50:18,446
- Wait! No!
- Pig!

407
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:22,856
- He's a cop!
- What about the rest of you?

408
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,428
You wanna party too?

409
00:50:31,502 --> 00:50:35,700
You want to answer the lady now?
Where did you get that doll?

410
00:50:35,806 --> 00:50:37,706
I don't know nothin'
about no doll.

411
00:50:37,808 --> 00:50:40,572
You won't know nothin'
about nothin'! Now talk!

412
00:50:40,676 --> 00:50:43,578
A burned-out toy store on Wabash!
That's where I got it.

413
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:48,550
Get outta here!

414
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,920
What's wrong?

415
00:50:53,023 --> 00:50:54,319
Nothing.

416
00:50:56,326 --> 00:50:58,817
Wait. Something the peddler said
upset you. What was it?

417
00:50:58,929 --> 00:51:01,022
I just told you-- nothing.

418
00:51:01,297 --> 00:51:04,563
Goddamn it! My son's life
is at stake! What was it?

419
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:09,964
The place where he said he got the doll,
Charles Lee Ray died there.

420
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:11,706
Who?

421
00:51:11,808 --> 00:51:15,675
The Lake Shore Strangler.
He's partners with Eddie Caputo.

422
00:51:15,778 --> 00:51:19,374
- Where are you going?
- Wabash and Van Buren.

423
00:51:19,482 --> 00:51:22,713
It's an abandoned wreck of a store.
Why don't you believe me?

424
00:51:22,819 --> 00:51:26,254
It was struck by lightning
the night Charles Lee Ray died.

425
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:32,591
- How do you know that?
- Because I was there! I killed him!

426
00:51:39,435 --> 00:51:41,926
Why didn't you tell me?

427
00:51:42,038 --> 00:51:45,474
It's not exactly the kind of thing
you tell someone.

428
00:51:45,541 --> 00:51:48,908
Let me take you home.
You need some sleep.

429
00:51:49,011 --> 00:51:51,570
- Did he say anything?
- Who?

430
00:51:51,681 --> 00:51:55,777
- Charles Lee Ray.
- He threatened to kill me and Caputo.

431
00:52:08,764 --> 00:52:11,755
Sorry you couldn't find anything
to help Andy.

432
00:52:11,867 --> 00:52:13,494
I really am.

433
00:52:13,603 --> 00:52:17,505
But I did. I found out
that Chucky is Charles Lee Ray.

434
00:52:17,607 --> 00:52:21,805
The only thing I don't know
is how he got inside the doll.

435
00:52:21,877 --> 00:52:24,778
- Good night.
- Where did Charles Lee Ray live?

436
00:52:25,914 --> 00:52:28,508
Look, please, will you
just get out of the car?

437
00:52:28,617 --> 00:52:30,278
Just tell me.

438
00:52:30,385 --> 00:52:32,786
Don't you understand?
Andy's life depends on it.

439
00:52:33,589 --> 00:52:36,386
730 Stoney Island,
the south side.

440
00:52:36,458 --> 00:52:40,326
I've already checked.
There's nothing there. Good night.

441
00:52:40,428 --> 00:52:41,759
Where are you going?

442
00:52:43,431 --> 00:52:45,399
- Home. Get some sleep.
- You can't do that!

443
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,934
Don't you see?
You just said it.

444
00:52:48,036 --> 00:52:50,368
Chucky killed Caputo.
That leaves you.

445
00:52:50,472 --> 00:52:52,963
- That does it.
- Please listen to me.

446
00:52:57,579 --> 00:52:59,843
- Out.
- I am telling you the truth!

447
00:52:59,914 --> 00:53:03,975
- Why won't you believe me?
- Because I'm sane and rational.

448
00:53:06,221 --> 00:53:08,189
All right!

449
00:53:08,289 --> 00:53:10,449
Do you remember what you said
the first night you met me?

450
00:53:10,558 --> 00:53:12,457
- What?
- You didn't like loose ends.

451
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:16,360
I'm a loose end. You can't let go what I
said tonight without checking it out.

452
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:18,364
For the last time,
good night.

453
00:54:16,557 --> 00:54:18,821
Good night, asshole.

454
00:55:06,638 --> 00:55:08,266
Oh, God!

455
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,941
Look out!

456
00:56:17,676 --> 00:56:21,441
Won't do ya any good!
You can't hurt me!

457
00:58:48,957 --> 00:58:51,517
What are you doing here?

458
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:54,494
After I talked to you last night...

459
00:58:54,596 --> 00:58:57,929
I decided to go back to the station
and pull Ray's file.

460
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,697
I learned a couple of things.
His nickname was Chucky.

461
00:59:03,405 --> 00:59:05,305
He spent a lot of time
with this man.

462
00:59:12,347 --> 00:59:15,748
All we have to do is find him
before Chucky does.

463
00:59:27,829 --> 00:59:29,888
Over here!

464
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,698
It's me. Chucky.

465
00:59:33,801 --> 00:59:37,397
What d'ya think?
The grigri work?

466
00:59:39,507 --> 00:59:43,534
You know, when I came here
learning about how to beat death...

467
00:59:43,644 --> 00:59:46,272
I thought maybe you were
pullin' my chain.

468
00:59:46,381 --> 00:59:48,280
But not now.

469
00:59:49,417 --> 00:59:52,284
- Only one problem.
- What?

470
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:56,551
This. I didn't think
anybody could hurt me.

471
00:59:56,624 --> 00:59:58,387
But last night I got shot.

472
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,551
Know somethin'?
It hurt.

473
01:00:01,629 --> 01:00:04,928
It hurt like a son of a bitch.
It even bled.

474
01:00:04,999 --> 01:00:06,227
Why's that?

475
01:00:07,435 --> 01:00:09,596
- You're turning human?
- What?

476
01:00:10,805 --> 01:00:14,605
The more time you spend
in that body...

477
01:00:14,708 --> 01:00:16,608
the more human you become.

478
01:00:18,546 --> 01:00:20,878
You mean I have to live
the rest of my life in this body?

479
01:00:22,349 --> 01:00:25,580
No fucking way! You got me
into this, you get me out!

480
01:00:27,521 --> 01:00:29,886
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

481
01:00:30,891 --> 01:00:34,348
Because you're an abomination!

482
01:00:34,462 --> 01:00:37,225
An outrage against nature!

483
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:39,798
You've perverted everything
I've taught you...

484
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,663
and used it for evil!

485
01:00:41,768 --> 01:00:43,668
You have to be stopped!

486
01:00:47,574 --> 01:00:50,407
You know, I thought
something like this might happen.

487
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:53,502
- That's why I prepared for it.
- What are you talking about?

488
01:00:54,348 --> 01:00:56,008
Your own personal mojo.

489
01:00:57,718 --> 01:00:59,708
- Give me that.
- Sure. How do you want it?

490
01:00:59,819 --> 01:01:01,616
Broken leg?

491
01:01:04,358 --> 01:01:08,623
Shouldn't tell your customers
where you hide things like this.

492
01:01:08,729 --> 01:01:10,719
Gets you in trouble every time.

493
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:13,697
How do I get out of this body?

494
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,564
- No. I won't tell you.
- Yeah?

495
01:01:19,539 --> 01:01:22,975
Tell me or die.
Your choice.

496
01:01:23,909 --> 01:01:25,810
I'll tell you.

497
01:01:27,614 --> 01:01:30,947
You have to transfer your soul
out of the doll...

498
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:35,316
into that of the first human being you
revealed your true self to.

499
01:01:35,421 --> 01:01:38,913
You mean the first person I let in on
the fact that I was really alive?

500
01:01:42,495 --> 01:01:45,328
I just don't believe it.

501
01:01:45,431 --> 01:01:49,491
The first person I told my secret
was a six-year-old kid.

502
01:01:49,602 --> 01:01:51,627
I'm gonna be six years old again.

503
01:01:51,737 --> 01:01:56,333
Well, it's been fun,
but I gotta go.

504
01:01:56,408 --> 01:01:59,400
I have a date
with a six-year-old boy.

505
01:02:01,013 --> 01:02:03,481
And you have a date
with death.

506
01:02:06,618 --> 01:02:08,644
So long.

507
01:02:33,812 --> 01:02:35,711
Hold it! Wait!

508
01:02:43,355 --> 01:02:45,289
Oh, my God.

509
01:02:48,326 --> 01:02:50,817
- Too late.
- What?

510
01:02:50,929 --> 01:02:53,295
Must save the boy. Must--

511
01:02:56,468 --> 01:02:58,458
Must get his souI...

512
01:02:58,569 --> 01:03:02,266
into him like he got into doll.

513
01:03:02,373 --> 01:03:03,806
What?

514
01:03:03,908 --> 01:03:07,639
You must stop him
before he can say the chant.

515
01:03:07,712 --> 01:03:10,977
Kill him before he can say it.

516
01:03:11,249 --> 01:03:12,978
But how?

517
01:03:13,851 --> 01:03:18,311
The heart.
His heart is almost human.

518
01:03:20,291 --> 01:03:23,920
It's the only way.
Through the heart.

519
01:03:41,746 --> 01:03:45,546
Help me!
Dr. Ardmore, Chucky's here!

520
01:03:54,892 --> 01:03:58,349
Help me! He's coming to kill me!

521
01:03:58,462 --> 01:04:00,224
He's here! Chucky's here!

522
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:03,367
I don't see anybody.

523
01:04:03,367 --> 01:04:05,527
But Chucky's here.

524
01:04:05,636 --> 01:04:07,796
And he's going to kill me.

525
01:04:11,574 --> 01:04:15,943
But Chucky is here,
and he's going to kill me!

526
01:04:18,948 --> 01:04:21,473
He's going to kill me.

527
01:04:21,584 --> 01:04:24,712
Please don't leave me. Please.

528
01:05:21,410 --> 01:05:23,343
Stop!

529
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:25,512
Stop him!

530
01:05:39,395 --> 01:05:40,726
Check the north corridor!

531
01:06:26,507 --> 01:06:28,873
Easy, Andy, easy.
It's all right.

532
01:06:28,976 --> 01:06:32,309
You're not gonna need this anymore.

533
01:06:32,412 --> 01:06:36,474
But I do! Chucky's in the room,
and he's trying to kill me!

534
01:06:36,583 --> 01:06:38,552
No. It's gonna be all right.

535
01:06:38,653 --> 01:06:40,450
I'm gonna protect you.

536
01:06:41,889 --> 01:06:43,789
Easy, boy, easy.

537
01:06:43,891 --> 01:06:45,586
Nobody's here.

538
01:06:45,693 --> 01:06:47,991
No, please! He'll kill you too.

539
01:06:48,262 --> 01:06:51,719
No. Please listen to me. Please!

540
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:54,563
This is just gonna sting you
for one second.

541
01:07:09,216 --> 01:07:11,845
Stop! Stop!

542
01:07:37,410 --> 01:07:38,468
What happened?

543
01:07:38,578 --> 01:07:41,172
Miss, could you just excuse us
for a minute?

544
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,747
What?

545
01:07:44,951 --> 01:07:46,316
- What?
- Yeah, yeah.

546
01:07:46,419 --> 01:07:49,581
Fried him to a crisp with the electric
shock machine, and then he escaped.

547
01:07:49,689 --> 01:07:51,350
Escaped? Where?

548
01:07:51,457 --> 01:07:54,585
We don't know,
but I bet she does.

549
01:07:59,933 --> 01:08:01,832
You seen Chucky anywhere?

550
01:08:03,336 --> 01:08:04,859
- Who's Chucky?
- Kid's doll.

551
01:08:04,971 --> 01:08:08,133
The same one that was at the station.
Have you seen him?

552
01:08:08,241 --> 01:08:10,801
What am I gonna know about a doll?
Where are you goin'?

553
01:08:14,347 --> 01:08:15,677
They think Andy did it.

554
01:08:15,782 --> 01:08:19,218
The girl said Chucky was here
looking for Andy.

555
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:21,218
- Where would Andy go?
- Home.

556
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:23,720
- I said go there if he was in trouble.
- Does he have a key?

557
01:08:23,822 --> 01:08:26,223
- It's under the mat.
- Come on. We don't have much time.

558
01:08:52,318 --> 01:08:53,410
Look, George.

559
01:08:53,518 --> 01:08:55,986
- Some child left their doll.
- Leave it alone.

560
01:08:56,254 --> 01:08:58,916
Whoever left it there
will come back looking for it.

561
01:09:04,663 --> 01:09:06,597
Ugly doll.

562
01:09:07,933 --> 01:09:09,559
Fuck you.

563
01:10:53,036 --> 01:10:54,765
Surprise!

564
01:11:26,469 --> 01:11:27,663
Batter up!

565
01:12:11,647 --> 01:12:15,413
Give me the power,
I beg of you.

566
01:12:41,409 --> 01:12:43,001
Can you hear me?

567
01:13:02,797 --> 01:13:04,924
Karen, are you all right?

568
01:13:09,537 --> 01:13:12,506
Just take care of Andy.

569
01:13:18,245 --> 01:13:20,509
Take this. Take it.

570
01:13:22,784 --> 01:13:24,376
Mommy.

571
01:14:24,477 --> 01:14:26,446
What's wrong? Gun jammed?

572
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:08,548
Andy, help me!
The matches!

573
01:15:10,522 --> 01:15:11,854
Please! Now!

574
01:15:23,969 --> 01:15:26,665
Andy, no, please.

575
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:29,605
We're friends to the end.
Remember?

576
01:15:29,708 --> 01:15:33,406
This is the end, friend.

577
01:16:17,688 --> 01:16:19,622
Oh, my baby.

578
01:16:21,426 --> 01:16:23,326
You all right?

579
01:16:30,267 --> 01:16:33,896
Go get me the first-aid kit
under the kitchen sink really fast.

580
01:16:34,005 --> 01:16:37,736
- What happened?
- Oh, God. Chucky's dead.

581
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:53,246
Mommy, Chucky's gone.

582
01:16:54,024 --> 01:16:55,993
Andy, hurry up.

583
01:17:12,409 --> 01:17:14,343
Hello, Andy.

584
01:17:16,513 --> 01:17:18,377
Mommy.

585
01:17:26,890 --> 01:17:29,358
Give me the boy
and I'll let you live!

586
01:17:29,459 --> 01:17:32,258
Do you hear me?
Give me the boy!

587
01:18:29,418 --> 01:18:32,148
Give me the boy!

588
01:19:40,487 --> 01:19:42,421
What the hell's goin' on here?

589
01:19:48,662 --> 01:19:50,289
God!

590
01:19:53,368 --> 01:19:54,835
Oh, Jesus.

591
01:19:58,006 --> 01:20:00,668
I got a cop down--
multiple stab wounds.

592
01:20:00,774 --> 01:20:04,175
Brewster Apartments
on north Grand Street. Make it fast.

593
01:20:04,279 --> 01:20:06,576
They're gonna be here in ten minutes.
What happened?

594
01:20:06,648 --> 01:20:09,775
The kid was right.
The doll's alive.

595
01:20:09,883 --> 01:20:12,511
- He almost got the three of us.
- What?

596
01:20:14,321 --> 01:20:18,223
You don't believe me? Go on.
Check it out in the hall.

597
01:20:18,325 --> 01:20:21,988
He's scattered all over the hall.
But don't touch it. Understand?

598
01:20:22,229 --> 01:20:25,323
- Don't you touch one part of it!
- All right. Take it easy.

599
01:20:25,432 --> 01:20:27,195
Just relax, all right?

600
01:21:07,006 --> 01:21:11,340
I'd like you to take a look, because
there's no way this thing's alive.

601
01:21:12,745 --> 01:21:16,181
- I told you not to touch it.
- Be sensible.

602
01:21:16,282 --> 01:21:18,512
Look. It's as dead as they come.

603
01:21:20,321 --> 01:21:22,584
Choke him! Kill him!

604
01:21:35,301 --> 01:21:39,635
Kill him now! Strangle him!
Don't let go!

605
01:21:45,011 --> 01:21:46,535
God.

606
01:21:55,488 --> 01:21:58,218
Kill them! Kill them all!

607
01:21:58,323 --> 01:22:00,382
The heart!
Shoot him in the heart!

608
01:22:25,884 --> 01:22:28,284
Hi. I'm Chucky.

609
01:22:28,353 --> 01:22:30,684
Wanna play--

610
01:22:42,367 --> 01:22:45,426
- You believe me now?
- Yeah.

611
01:22:47,806 --> 01:22:50,274
But who's gonna believe me?

612
01:22:54,311 --> 01:22:55,472
Come on.

613
01:22:58,350 --> 01:23:00,544
All right. Ready?
Here we go.

614
01:23:21,973 --> 01:23:25,408
Come on. We're gonna
go to the hospital with Mike.

615
01:23:25,509 --> 01:23:26,976
Let's go.
