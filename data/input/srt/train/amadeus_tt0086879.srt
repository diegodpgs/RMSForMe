1
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,880
Mozart!

2
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,760
Mozart!

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,880
Forgive your assassin!

4
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,000
I confess,I killed you!

5
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,560
"S?,I killed you,Mozart.

6
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,200
Mozart,"piet?! Forgive your assassin!

7
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,680
Forgive me,Mozart!

8
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,440
Signore Salieri, open the door,be good now!

9
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,880
"Signore",we have something special for you.

10
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,480
Something you're going to love.

11
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,600
Is that good!

12
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,000
"Signore",believe me...

13
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,280
...this is the most delicious thing I ever ate in my life!

14
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,280
Really,you don't know what you're miss...

15
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,280
All right,that's enough! Open the door.

16
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,400
"Signore",if you don't open this door...

17
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,480
...we're gonna leave nothing for you.

18
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,480
And I'm never gonna come see you again!

19
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,760
Good morning,Father.

20
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,200
Herr Salieri?

21
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,640
Leave me alone.

22
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,480
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.

23
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,080
Do you know who I am?

24
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,120
That makes no difference.

25
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,880
All men are equal in God's eyes.

26
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,520
Are they?

27
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,000
Offer me your confession.

28
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,160
I can offer you God's forgiveness.

29
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,400
How well are you trained in music?

30
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,960
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.

31
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,440
- Where? - Here in Vienna.

32
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,600
Then you must know this.

33
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,040
I can't say that I do.

34
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,520
What is it?

35
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,800
It was a very popular tune in its day.

36
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,880
I wrote it.

37
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,280
Here,how about this?

38
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,040
This one brought down the house when we played it.

39
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,000
Well?

40
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,760
I regret it is not too familiar.

41
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,080
Can you recall no melody of mine?

42
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,520
I was the most famous composer in Europe.

43
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,880
I wrote 40 operas alone.

44
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,720
Here!

45
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,920
What about this one?

46
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,800
Yes,I know that!

47
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,560
That's charming!

48
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,360
I'm sorry,I didn't know you wrote that.

49
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,080
I didn't.

50
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,520
That was Mozart.

51
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,880
Wolfgang...

52
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,480
...Amadeus Mozart.

53
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,320
The man you accuse yourself of killing.

54
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,400
You've heard that?

55
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,160
Is it true?

56
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,880
For God's sake,my son...

57
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,440
...if you have something to confess, do it now.

58
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,880
Give yourself some peace.

59
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,240
He...

60
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,840
...was my idol.

61
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,360
Mozart.

62
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,360
I can't think of a time when I didn't know his name.

63
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,360
I was playing games...

64
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,880
... when he was playing music for kings and emperors.

65
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,360
Even the pope in Rome.

66
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,080
I admit,I was jealous...

67
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,520
... when I heard the tales they told about him.

68
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,080
Not of the brilliant little prodigy...

69
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,200
... but of his father, who had taught him everything.

70
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,240
My father,he did not care for music.

71
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,840
When I told him...

72
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,600
...how I wished I could be like Mozart...

73
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,240
... he would say,"Why? Do you want to be a trained monkey?

74
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:08,000
You'd like me to drag you around, doing tricks like a circus freak?"

75
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,480
How could I tell him...

76
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,000
...what music meant to me?

77
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,720
While my father prayed earnestly to God...

78
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,880
... to protect commerce...

79
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,000
... I would offer up...

80
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,680
... secretly...

81
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,120
... the proudest prayer a boy could think of.

82
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,680
"Lord,make me a great composer."

83
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,840
"Let me celebrate your glory through music...

84
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,040
... and be celebrated myself."

85
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,960
"Make me famous through the world."

86
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,440
"Make me immortal."

87
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,600
"After I die...

88
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:12,760
...let people speak my name with love for what I wrote."

89
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,560
"In return...

90
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,200
...I will give you my chastity...

91
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,320
...my industry...

92
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,720
...my deepest humility, every hour of my life."

93
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,160
"Amen."

94
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,960
And do you know what happened?

95
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,840
A miracle!

96
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,440
My life changed forever.

97
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,280
I knew God had arranged it all. That was obvious.

98
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,720
One minute I was a frustrated boy...

99
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,800
...in an obscure little town. The next I was here...

100
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,040
...in Vienna,city of musicians...

101
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,000
... and Emperor Joseph, the musical king.

102
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,200
In a few years,I was his court composer. Isn't that incredible?

103
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,640
Every night I sat with the emperor of Austria...

104
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,680
... playing duets with him...

105
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,120
... correcting the royal sight-reading.

106
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,920
Actually,the man had no ear at all.

107
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,880
But what did it matter?

108
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,960
He adored my music.

109
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,080
Tell me...

110
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,080
If you had been me...

111
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:57,400
...wouldn't you have thought God had accepted your vow?

112
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,160
And believe me,I honored it.

113
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,880
I was a model of virtue.

114
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,400
I kept my hands off women.

115
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:10,080
I worked hours every day teaching students,many for free!

116
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,480
Sitting on endless committees to help poor musicians.

117
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,320
Work,that was all my life.

118
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,680
And it was wonderful.

119
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,960
Everybody liked me.

120
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,160
I liked myself.

121
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,760
Until he came.

122
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,440
He came to Vienna to play some of his music...

123
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:47,320
...at the residence of the Prince Archbishop of Salzburg.

124
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,480
Eagerly,I went there to seek him out.

125
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,680
That night...

126
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,720
... changed my life.

127
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,040
As I wandered through the salon...

128
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,960
... I played a little game with myself.

129
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,600
This man had written his first concerto at the age of 4...

130
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,960
... his first symphony at 7, a full-scale opera at 12!

131
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,000
Did it show?

132
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,800
Is talent like that...

133
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,960
... written on the face?

134
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,360
Which one of them...

135
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,280
... could he be?

136
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,360
Mozart is not here.

137
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,280
- Stop it! - I am.

138
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,880
- Stop it! - I am stopping it.

139
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,160
I am! I'm stopping it. Slowly.

140
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,840
There. You see? I've stopped.

141
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,040
- Now we're going back. - No!

142
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,920
Yes! You don't know where you are.

143
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,000
Here,everything goes backwards.

144
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,440
People walk and dance and sing and even talk backwards.

145
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:20,640
- That's stupid. - Why? People fart backwards.

146
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,200
Ssa-ym-ssik!

147
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,040
Ssa-ym-ssik!

148
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,600
Yes,you are. You are very sick.

149
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,600
No! Say it backwards,shitwit!

150
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,120
Ssa-ym-ssik.

151
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,280
Ssik,kiss.

152
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,960
Ym,my. Ssa.

153
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,520
Kiss my ass.

154
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,040
Em-yrram!

155
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,960
- I'm not playing! - Say it,it's serious.

156
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,120
It's very serious.

157
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,560
Yrram.

158
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,320
Marry me.

159
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,640
I'm not gonna marry you. You're a fiend.

160
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,800
Uoy-evol-I-tub.

161
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,720
Tub.

162
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,360
But I...

163
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,520
...love...

164
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,800
But I love you?

165
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,920
- Tihs-ym-tae. - What?

166
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,720
- Eat. - Eat.

167
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,920
- Ym,my. - My.

168
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,360
Tihs. Eat my shit.

169
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,680
You filthy fiend!

170
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,400
You filthy...!

171
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,400
My music.

172
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,640
They've started without me.

173
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,800
That was Mozart!

174
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:19,040
That giggling,dirty creature I'd just seen crawling on the floor.

175
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,680
- I think that went well,don't you? - Indeed.

176
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,360
The Viennese know good music, don't you think?

177
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,200
Certainly.

178
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,520
Your Grace.

179
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,920
Ah,Mozart.

180
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,920
- Why? - Why what,sir?

181
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,040
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests...

182
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,600
...by one of my own servants?

183
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,360
The more license I allow you, the more you take.

184
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,960
If His Grace is not satisfied, he can dismiss me.

185
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,720
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg.

186
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,200
- Your father is waiting for you there. - No,Your Grace!

187
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,400
I would prefer you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.

188
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:15,000
I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service...

189
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,480
...and learn your place.

190
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,160
On the page it looked...

191
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,160
Nothing!

192
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,480
The beginning simple,almost comic.

193
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,280
Just a pulse.

194
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,120
Bassoons,basset horns...

195
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,880
...like a rusty squeezebox.

196
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,800
And then,suddenly...

197
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,840
...high above it...

198
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,840
...an oboe.

199
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,280
A single note,hanging there, unwavering.

200
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,760
Until...

201
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,480
...a clarinet took it over...

202
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:45,320
...sweetened it into a phrase of such delight.

203
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,560
This was no composition by a performing monkey.

204
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,720
This was a music I had never heard.

205
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,480
Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing.

206
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,320
It seemed to me I was hearing the voice of God.

207
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,080
Excuse me.

208
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,120
But why?

209
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:21,080
Why would God choose an obscene child to be his instrument?

210
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,560
It was not to be believed.

211
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:29,960
This piece had to be an accident. It had to be.

212
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,080
It better be.

213
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,640
How good is he,this Mozart?

214
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:43,480
He's remarkable,Majesty. I heard an extraordinary opera of his last month.

215
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,640
-Idomeneo,King of Crete.  - That?

216
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,880
A tiresome piece. I heard it too.

217
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,080
Tiresome?

218
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,560
A young man trying to impress beyond his abilities.

219
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,800
Too much spice.

220
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,880
Too many notes.

221
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,360
Majesty...

222
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,080
...it was the most promising work I've heard in years.

223
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,920
Then,we should make some effort to acquire him.

224
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,520
We could use a good German composer in Vienna,surely?

225
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:22,000
I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say...

226
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,600
...an opera in German for our National Theater.

227
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,800
Excellent,sire!

228
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,040
But not German. I beg,Your Majesty.

229
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,640
Italian is the proper language for opera.

230
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,120
All educated people agree on that.

231
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,440
What do you think,chamberlain?

232
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,360
In my opinion,it's time we had a piece in our own language.

233
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:56,240
Plain German for plain people.

234
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,200
Kapellmeister?

235
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,000
Majesty...

236
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,040
...I must agree with "Herr Direttore".

237
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,760
German is...

238
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,680
...too brute for singing.

239
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,600
Court composer...

240
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,640
...what do you think?

241
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,960
I think it's an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna.

242
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,280
It should infuriate the archbishop...

243
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,200
...if that is Your Majesty's intention.

244
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,480
You are "cattivo",court composer.

245
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,520
I want to meet this young man. Arrange a pleasant welcome for him.

246
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,960
Well,there it is!

247
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,240
This is a beautiful wig for you.

248
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,400
It looks so marvelous and I love it.

249
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,440
The other one.

250
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,960
Here is the other one. I think you will love it.

251
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,360
Here's the third one. So? Here we go.

252
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,240
- How do you like it? - They're all so beautiful!

253
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,320
Why don't I have three heads?

254
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,680
This is funny!

255
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,240
Three heads!

256
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,680
Gentlemen.

257
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:03,440
- Good morning. - Morning,Your Majesty.

258
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,640
What do you have for me today?

259
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,760
- Your Majesty,"Herr Mozart". - Yes,what about him?

260
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,480
He's here.

261
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,120
Well,there it is. Good!

262
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:23,840
I hope you won't find it improper, but I've written a march in his honor.

263
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,080
What a charming idea,court composer. May I see?

264
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,680
Just a...

265
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:34,120
Just a trifle,of course.

266
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,720
May I try it?

267
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,280
Let's have some fun.

268
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,440
Delightful,court composer!

269
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,040
May I play it when he comes in?

270
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,000
- You do me too much honor. - Bring in "Herr Mozart".

271
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,880
But slowly.

272
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,280
I need a minute to practice.

273
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,120
Good,continue.

274
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,840
G,Majesty.

275
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,880
Excellent!

276
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,200
Good,Majesty.

277
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,760
Continue. Very good.

278
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,320
Very good,Majesty.

279
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,480
Tempo! Up.

280
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,400
Lightly,then strongly! It's a march,Majesty.

281
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,800
Again.

282
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,760
Bravo,Majesty!

283
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:58,760
Gentlemen,please. A little less enthusiasm,I beg you.

284
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,480
No,please. It's not a holy relic.

285
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,640
You know,we have met before. In this very room.

286
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,200
You don't recall. You were only 6. He was giving a delightful concert!

287
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,040
As he got off the stool,he fell.

288
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,120
My sister Antoinette helped him up. Know what he did?

289
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:31,840
He jumped into her arms and said, "Will you marry me? Yes or no?"

290
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,000
You know all these gentlemen. The Baron Van Swieten.

291
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,960
- I'm a great admirer of yours. - Thank you.

292
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,400
Kapellmeister Bonno.

293
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,080
My pleasure.

294
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,920
The Director of Opera, Count Orsini-Rosenberg.

295
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,920
Sir,yes. The honor is mine, absolutely!

296
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,800
Here is our illustrious court composer...

297
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,200
...Maestro Salieri.

298
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:08,360
At last,such immense joy!

299
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,560
I know your work well.

300
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:15,360
You know,I composed some variations on a melody of yours.

301
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,520
- Really? Which one? - "Mio Caro Adone."

302
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,120
I'm flattered.

303
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,440
A funny tune, but it yielded good things.

304
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,520
And now he has returned the compliment.

305
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,320
"Herr Salieri" composed this little march for you.

306
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,800
Really?

307
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,040
Well,there it is.

308
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:41,600
Down to business. We're going to commission an opera from you.

309
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,760
What do you say?

310
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,880
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?

311
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,320
Sire,if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.

312
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,480
Did we?

313
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,880
I don't think it was really decided, Your Majesty.

314
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,160
- German. Please let it be German. - Why so?

315
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,600
Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto.

316
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,360
Have I seen it?

317
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,640
I don't think you have,"Herr Direktor". It's quite new.

318
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,200
- I'll show it to you immediately. - I think you'd better.

319
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,120
Well...

320
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:30,920
...tell us about it. Tell us the story.

321
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,560
Well,it's quite amusing,Majesty.

322
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:42,080
It's set... The whole thing is set in a...

323
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,600
Yes? Where?

324
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,840
In a harem,Majesty. In a seraglio.

325
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:57,320
- You mean in Turkey? - Yes,exactly.

326
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,480
Then why especially does it have to be in German?

327
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:08,080
It doesn't,especially. It could be in Turkish if you really want.

328
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,920
No,my dear fellow,the language is not finally the point.

329
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,720
Do you really think that subject is appropriate for a national theater?

330
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,120
Why not? It's charming.

331
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:28,840
I mean,I won't actually show concubines exposing their...

332
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,480
It's not indecent. It's highly moral,Majesty.

333
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,480
It's full of proper German virtues.

334
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,040
Excuse me,Majesty,but what do you think these could be?

335
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,440
Being a foreigner,I'd love to learn.

336
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,000
Well,tell him,Mozart.

337
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,720
Name us a German virtue.

338
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,880
- Love,sire. - Oh,love!

339
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:58,240
Of course,in Italy we know nothing about love.

340
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,600
No,I don't think you do.

341
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:07,400
Watching Italian opera, all those male sopranos screeching...

342
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:14,640
...stupid,fat couples rolling their eyes about. That's not love. It's rubbish!

343
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,360
Majesty,you choose the language.

344
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,120
I'll set it to the finest music ever offered a monarch.

345
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:28,520
Well,there it is. Let it be German.

346
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,480
This is yours.

347
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,400
Keep it. It's already here in my head.

348
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,840
What? On one hearing only?

349
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:41,880
I think so,sire. Yes.

350
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,040
Show us.

351
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:19,720
The rest is just the same,isn't it?

352
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,400
That doesn't really work,does it?

353
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,880
Did you try...?

354
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,320
Shouldn't it be a bit more...?

355
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,240
Or this?

356
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,040
This. Yes.

357
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,200
Better? What do you think?

358
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:35,480
Grazie,Signore.

359
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:40,360
All I ever wanted was to sing to God.

360
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,360
He gave me that longing...

361
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,760
...and then made me mute. Why?

362
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,760
Tell me that.

363
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,840
If he didn't want me to praise him with music...

364
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,920
...why implant the desire...

365
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,360
...like a lust in my body?

366
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,600
And then deny me the talent?

367
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,960
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson,sir.

368
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,400
Maestro.

369
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,120
Well...?

370
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,200
How do you like it?

371
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,800
It's Turkish.

372
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,600
My hairdresser said everything this year's going to be Turkish.

373
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,200
Does he?

374
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,480
What else did he tell you today?

375
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:45,280
Come,come! Give me some gossip.

376
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,720
Well,I heard you met "Herr Mozart".

377
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,960
News travels fast in Vienna.

378
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,160
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?

379
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,600
- Yes. - Is there a part in it for me?

380
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,520
- No. - How do you know?

381
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,400
- Do you know where it's set,my dear? - Where?

382
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,160
In a harem.

383
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:18,320
- What's that? - A brothel.

384
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,080
Come.

385
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,480
Let's begin.

386
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,160
- What does he look like? - Mozart?

387
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,720
- You might be disappointed. - Why?

388
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,240
Looks and talent don't always go together,Katerina.

389
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,240
Looks don't concern me,maestro.

390
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,920
Only talent interests a woman of taste.

391
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:49,040
Shall we continue?

392
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,760
There she was.

393
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,400
I don't know where they met or how.  There she stood!

394
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,960
On stage,for all to see.

395
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,800
Showing off like the greedy songbird she was.

396
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:18,680
Ten minutes of ghastly scales. Arpeggios!

397
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:24,560
Whizzing up and down like fireworks at a fairground.

398
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,920
Understand,I was in love with the girl.

399
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,120
Or at least in lust.

400
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:47,280
And I swear to you, I never laid a finger on her.

401
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,360
All the same,I couldn't bear to think of anyone else touching her.

402
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:00,040
Least of all,"the creature".

403
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:47,840
Brava,madame! You are an ornament to our stage.

404
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,880
Your Majesty.

405
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,920
Well,"Herr Mozart". A good effort.

406
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,840
Well,decidedly that.

407
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:03,360
An excellent effort! You have shown us something...

408
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,680
...quite new tonight. - It is new.

409
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,480
- It is,isn't it,sire? - Yes,indeed.

410
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:14,080
So then,you liked it? You really liked it,sire?

411
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,280
Well,of course I did! It's very good!

412
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,520
Of course,now and then, just now and then...

413
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,520
...it seemed a touch...

414
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,640
What do you mean,sire?

415
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:32,640
Well,I mean,occasionally, it seems to have...

416
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,840
How shall one say...?

417
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,400
How shall one say,"direktor"?

418
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,160
- Too many notes,Majesty? - Exactly. Very well put.

419
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,560
- Too many notes. - I don't understand.

420
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,320
There are just as many notes as I required,neither more nor less.

421
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,200
My dear fellow,there are in fact...

422
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:01,920
...only so many notes the ear can hear in an evening.

423
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:07,320
I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I,court composer?

424
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,480
Yes. On the whole,yes,Majesty.

425
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,240
This is absurd!

426
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,720
Young man,don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious.

427
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,600
It's quality work.

428
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:25,480
And there are simply too many notes. Just cut a few and it'll be perfect.

429
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,560
Which few did you have in mind?

430
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,360
Wolfgang!

431
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:35,960
Wolfgang,my dear!

432
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:40,080
- Wolfgang! - Majesty,this is "Frau Weber".

433
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,360
She's my landlady.

434
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:52,520
- Enchanted,madame. - Sire,such an honor!

435
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,800
This is my dear daughter,Constanze.

436
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:03,400
- She's the fiancée of "Herr Mozart". - Really?

437
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:11,000
How charming. Please.

438
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,920
Well...

439
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,000
...when do you marry?

440
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:36,200
We haven't exactly received my father's consent yet.

441
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:41,960
Not entirely. Not altogether.

442
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:48,200
- Excuse me,but how old are you? - 26.

443
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,760
My advice is for you to marry this charming young lady...

444
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,280
...and stay with us in Vienna. - You see?

445
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,600
I told him that, but he won't listen to me.

446
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,840
Your Majesty, you give such wonderful...

447
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:10,120
...such royal advice. May I...?

448
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,600
Well,there it is.

449
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:26,240
Wolfie,will you get some water?

450
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:31,840
Will you get some water,please?

451
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,440
Wolfie,get some water!

452
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:49,720
Excuse me. Excuse me.

453
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,600
Did you know?

454
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:02,680
- What? - The marriage.

455
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,320
What does it matter to you?

456
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:12,920
Nothing. He can marry who he pleases, I don't give a damn.

457
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,800
How was I?

458
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,160
You were sublime.

459
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:23,320
And what did you think of the music?

460
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,560
Extremely clever.

461
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,840
Katerina,I...

462
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,240
Excuse me.

463
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:35,000
Is that woman still lying on the floor?

464
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:41,200
- No,she's fine. - Oh,I'm so relieved.

465
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,920
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.

466
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:49,240
- Did you like it then? - How could I not?

467
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:53,040
It's the best music in Vienna today,don't you agree?

468
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:58,000
She must be dazzling in bed.

469
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:02,120
I assume she's the virtuoso in that department.

470
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:07,800
No other reason why you'd marry someone like that.

471
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,800
Come in.

472
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:15,840
Excuse me. Wolfie,Mom isn't feeling very well.

473
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,720
- Can we go home? - Yes.

474
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:21,160
No,no,no. You can't take him away now.

475
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,120
This is his night.

476
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,920
Won't you introduce us,Wolfgang?

477
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:32,400
Excuse us,"Fräulein". Good night,"signore".
