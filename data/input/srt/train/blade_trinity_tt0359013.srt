1
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:48,136
<i>In the movies, Dracula wears a cape,</i>

2
00:00:48,175 --> 00:00:50,444
<i>and some old English guy
always manages to save the day</i>

3
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:53,021
<i>at the last minute
with crosses and holy water.</i>

4
00:00:53,752 --> 00:00:56,559
<i>But everybody knows
the movies are full of shit.</i>

5
00:00:57,521 --> 00:01:02,175
<i>The truth is it started with Blade,
and it ended with him.</i>

6
00:01:02,252 --> 00:01:04,636
<i>The rest of us
were just along for the ride.</i>

7
00:03:07,577 --> 00:03:09,192
What's this chicken scratch?

8
00:03:09,462 --> 00:03:11,538
It's cuneiform.

9
00:03:11,615 --> 00:03:13,885
It's about 4,000 years old.

10
00:03:14,538 --> 00:03:15,615
So why here?

11
00:03:15,692 --> 00:03:18,500
Because this is the cradle of civilization.

12
00:03:19,962 --> 00:03:22,385
He would've been comfortable here.

13
00:03:22,462 --> 00:03:24,808
I don't know, Dan.
This seems like another dead end.

14
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:26,115
There's something beneath us.

15
00:03:26,192 --> 00:03:28,000
You find a watch?

16
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:32,269
Is it a body?

17
00:03:36,385 --> 00:03:37,500
Guys?

18
00:03:40,885 --> 00:03:42,769
Aah!

19
00:03:44,462 --> 00:03:47,077
Go! Aah!

20
00:03:47,154 --> 00:03:48,885
What the fuck?!

21
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:00,615
Aah!

22
00:06:13,138 --> 00:06:14,676
I'm on the Stonebridge overpass.

23
00:06:14,753 --> 00:06:16,061
Got it. Heading westbound.

24
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,176
I'm just beneath ya.

25
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,638
Go!

26
00:08:30,407 --> 00:08:32,176
I got him. Pull!

27
00:08:33,407 --> 00:08:34,368
You all right, man?

28
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:52,753
He's got a gun!

29
00:09:06,715 --> 00:09:08,522
Oh, my God!

30
00:09:19,445 --> 00:09:20,599
Ouch.

31
00:09:23,253 --> 00:09:25,138
Staked you with silver.

32
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:27,945
Why aren't you ash?

33
00:09:28,022 --> 00:09:30,099
Why aren't you smarter?

34
00:09:31,099 --> 00:09:33,522
Not a vampire, dumb shit!

35
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,792
Set your sorry ass up.

36
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,061
Damn.

37
00:10:26,215 --> 00:10:28,292
Oh, Blade.

38
00:11:04,138 --> 00:11:05,830
What the fuck happen tonight?

39
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,907
How should I know?

40
00:11:10,945 --> 00:11:12,292
He was human.

41
00:11:13,099 --> 00:11:14,330
You're gettin' reckless, Blade.

42
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,138
Killing vampires is clean.

43
00:11:16,215 --> 00:11:19,830
They ash-- don't leave
any evidence behind.

44
00:11:19,868 --> 00:11:21,368
Killing humans is messy.

45
00:11:21,445 --> 00:11:23,292
You better hope nobody ID'd you.

46
00:11:24,215 --> 00:11:26,176
This worked really good.

47
00:11:30,138 --> 00:11:31,292
What's this?

48
00:11:31,368 --> 00:11:33,638
A new delivery system for your serum.

49
00:11:33,676 --> 00:11:35,599
It's an effervescent inhaler.

50
00:11:35,676 --> 00:11:37,407
Just bite down on the mouth guard.

51
00:11:37,484 --> 00:11:39,484
Delivery's automatic.

52
00:11:39,561 --> 00:11:41,099
Some friends of mine made it.

53
00:11:41,676 --> 00:11:43,215
Friends?

54
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:45,984
Yeah.
You remember those?

55
00:11:46,022 --> 00:11:47,445
<i>It was horrible.</i>

56
00:11:47,522 --> 00:11:50,830
<i>The one car crashed, and then the guy
in the coat was shooting the other guy.</i>

57
00:11:50,907 --> 00:11:53,138
<i>- It looked like there was a lot of blood.
- Thank you.</i>

58
00:11:53,253 --> 00:11:55,330
<i>That was just a taste
of the mayhem that occurred</i>

59
00:11:55,407 --> 00:11:57,061
<i>during tonight's brazen shootout</i>

60
00:11:57,099 --> 00:11:59,253
<i>that left at least four people dead.</i>

61
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,138
<i>Now, apparently, an anonymous citizen</i>

62
00:12:01,215 --> 00:12:02,945
<i>captured the whole event on video.</i>

63
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,753
Hey, Ray.
Hey, we got a lead.

64
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,215
Let's catch a plane, Wilson.

65
00:12:06,253 --> 00:12:07,907
It's time to take these cowboys down.

66
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:09,478
That's what I'm talkin' about.

67
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:43,478
What's he been doing?

68
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:45,171
Fuck all. Just feeding.

69
00:12:45,248 --> 00:12:46,786
Been through five of them so far.

70
00:12:46,863 --> 00:12:48,324
Do you think we have enough security?

71
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:51,517
We didn't capture him.
He allowed us to take him in.

72
00:12:51,555 --> 00:12:52,555
You understand?

73
00:12:52,632 --> 00:12:53,978
I'm gonna go in.

74
00:14:00,748 --> 00:14:02,671
You shouldn't have woken me.

75
00:14:03,555 --> 00:14:04,709
We had to.

76
00:14:09,363 --> 00:14:13,478
Your blood, your sacrament,
can set us free now.

77
00:14:14,632 --> 00:14:16,748
What makes you think I care?

78
00:14:16,863 --> 00:14:18,094
Your people need you.

79
00:14:18,171 --> 00:14:19,440
My people?

80
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:26,324
You're nothing but shadows
of your former selves.

81
00:14:26,363 --> 00:14:28,632
Look how far you have fallen.

82
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:30,786
The world's changed since your time.

83
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:32,632
The humans have a new hunter.

84
00:14:34,171 --> 00:14:35,478
Blade.

85
00:14:35,594 --> 00:14:38,517
And you'd like me
to kill him, wouldn't you?

86
00:14:38,594 --> 00:14:40,671
Yes.

87
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,401
Subject is heading west.

88
00:15:09,478 --> 00:15:10,555
Got him.

89
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,914
Tonight, Dr. Edgar Vance,
forensic psychiatrist

90
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:22,491
<i>and author of the New York Times
bestseller Human Health,</i>

91
00:15:22,568 --> 00:15:24,645
<i>The Whole Being Breakthrough.</i>

92
00:15:24,722 --> 00:15:28,568
Also with us, Martin Vreede,
Chief of Police.

93
00:15:28,645 --> 00:15:32,260
They'll be here for the next hour,
and they'll be taking your calls,

94
00:15:32,337 --> 00:15:35,607
<i>next on Bently Tittle Live.</i>

95
00:15:36,721 --> 00:15:39,106
ok
Chief Vreede.

96
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:41,811
What's your take on all these rumors
we've been hearing about vampires?

97
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,981
If vampires existed, don't you think
we would've found them by now?

98
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,756
they should focus in on characters
like this Blade criminal.

99
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,650
Now, that's the guy I wanna hear about.

100
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:54,213
I wanna hear about this character Blade.
What about him?

101
00:15:54,577 --> 00:15:57,000
He's a sociopath
that we've been pursuing.

102
00:15:57,215 --> 00:16:00,753
Blade is a troubled individual.

103
00:16:00,954 --> 00:16:03,301
I understand that he is
under the impression

104
00:16:03,741 --> 00:16:05,665
that there is a vast conspiracy
of vampires.

105
00:16:08,609 --> 00:16:10,917
Now, you've got to look
at the psychiatric underpinnings

106
00:16:13,923 --> 00:16:16,346
Congratulations.
You're famous.

107
00:16:16,423 --> 00:16:17,807
Somebody nailed us.

108
00:16:17,884 --> 00:16:20,384
Your face is all over the papers
and television.

109
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,153
Media's eatin' it up.

110
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,807
- Like I care.
- Well, you should.

111
00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:27,538
Something like this--
taking out a human--

112
00:16:27,576 --> 00:16:30,153
as far as the rest
of the world is concerned,

113
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,346
you're public enemy number one.

114
00:16:32,384 --> 00:16:35,230
Didn't know this was
a popularity contest.

115
00:16:36,076 --> 00:16:38,769
Damn it, Blade.
Don't you see what they're doing?

116
00:16:38,846 --> 00:16:41,807
They're waging
a goddamn P.R. campaign.

117
00:16:41,884 --> 00:16:44,961
Now it's not just vampires
we gotta worry about,

118
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:48,076
we're gonna have to take on
the rest of the world, too.

119
00:16:49,653 --> 00:16:52,807
You worry too much, old man.

120
00:16:52,884 --> 00:16:55,076
That's why we're still alive, goddamn it.

121
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,500
I've been doing this
since before you were born, Blade.

122
00:16:58,538 --> 00:17:00,230
You're like a son to me.

123
00:17:00,884 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm sorry I got old on ya.

124
00:17:03,076 --> 00:17:06,115
I see you alone,
surrounded by enemies.

125
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,000
And it breaks my heart.

126
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,384
We can't win this war alone.

127
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,863
Oh, got it! Got it!

128
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,760
Baby on board.

129
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:21,453
Oh! Looks like we got ourselves
a combo meal!

130
00:17:35,084 --> 00:17:37,699
Chicky, chicky, chicky, chicky, chicky!

131
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:26,176
Oh, yeah, baby!

132
00:18:26,253 --> 00:18:28,022
What's for dinner?

133
00:18:39,522 --> 00:18:40,637
Aah!

134
00:18:40,984 --> 00:18:42,407
Hey, pretty lady.

135
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,791
No! No!

136
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:54,022
No!

137
00:18:57,099 --> 00:18:59,137
Scream if this hurts, chica.

138
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:03,868
Aah!

139
00:19:04,214 --> 00:19:05,714
Fuck you?

140
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:08,445
Aah!

141
00:19:08,521 --> 00:19:10,098
Garlic!

142
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,942
<i>Scream if this hurts, chica.</i>

143
00:20:14,602 --> 00:20:16,871
Aah!

144
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:18,813
What is it?

145
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,621
What you were worried about.

146
00:21:38,198 --> 00:21:39,621
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

147
00:21:43,467 --> 00:21:45,160
<i>Shoot to kill!</i>

148
00:22:21,352 --> 00:22:22,544
Aah!

149
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:16,660
Move a finger and you're dead.

150
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,390
How's about this one?

151
00:23:18,467 --> 00:23:19,775
He's got something in his hand!

152
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,236
Get out, Blade!

153
00:23:26,621 --> 00:23:27,621
Shit!

154
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,621
What's going on in there?

155
00:23:44,682 --> 00:23:46,028
Somebody talk to me!

156
00:23:49,593 --> 00:23:53,724
Aah!

157
00:23:53,861 --> 00:23:55,207
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

158
00:24:39,861 --> 00:24:42,707
Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

159
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,669
Special Agents Ray Cumberland,
Wilson Hale, FBI.

160
00:24:50,746 --> 00:24:53,169
- We've been tracking you a long time.
- Mm-hmm.

161
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:55,207
Whistler.

162
00:24:55,284 --> 00:24:56,476
Dead.

163
00:24:58,284 --> 00:24:59,900
Just like all your victims.

164
00:25:01,553 --> 00:25:03,169
Say, how many people
have you killed, Blade?

165
00:25:03,246 --> 00:25:05,515
Thirty? Forty? Fifty?

166
00:25:06,784 --> 00:25:08,900
1,182.

167
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:12,053
But they were all familiars.

168
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,053
People who work with them.

169
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:17,823
Oh. And by "them,"
you mean vampires, right?

170
00:25:22,065 --> 00:25:25,373
You can keep doing your song
and dance as long as you want, Blade.

171
00:25:25,411 --> 00:25:26,911
It's not gonna play.

172
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,296
We know what you are.

173
00:25:29,373 --> 00:25:31,065
You're a stone-cold killer.

174
00:25:31,142 --> 00:25:32,757
And you're sick as fuck.

175
00:25:32,796 --> 00:25:35,257
Let's leave the diagnosis
to the professionals.

176
00:25:36,796 --> 00:25:38,065
Hello, Blade.

177
00:25:38,642 --> 00:25:39,873
My name is Dr. Vance.

178
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:43,565
I've been charged with giving you
a psychiatric evaluation.

179
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:47,757
Gentlemen, would you mind giving us
just a couple of minutes alone?

180
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:49,565
He's all yours.

181
00:26:01,071 --> 00:26:03,455
I know you must find this
very frightening...

182
00:26:04,571 --> 00:26:06,994
...but I want you to know
that I'm here to help.

183
00:26:08,071 --> 00:26:09,686
And in order for me to do that,

184
00:26:09,724 --> 00:26:13,801
I'm gonna have to ask you
a couple of questions, okay?

185
00:26:14,148 --> 00:26:15,648
Do you know what day it is?

186
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:23,592
<i>How about the President?
You know who that is.</i>

187
00:26:22,168 --> 00:26:24,053
An asshole.

188
00:26:30,973 --> 00:26:33,935
<i>But I want to hear you
talk about vampires.</i>

189
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:35,864
What can you tell me about them?

190
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,765
They exist.

191
00:26:41,073 --> 00:26:42,342
Are you one of them?

192
00:26:45,816 --> 00:26:47,701
Tell me about blood.

193
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,624
When you drink blood,

194
00:26:49,701 --> 00:26:52,509
do you ever feel sexually aroused?

195
00:26:56,701 --> 00:27:00,663
Just strikes me
that this business of vampirism

196
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:04,209
has a very strong element
of sexual confusion.

197
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:15,787
And I'm wondering what your
relationship with your mother was like.

198
00:27:11,932 --> 00:27:13,586
A nocturnal visit.

199
00:27:18,633 --> 00:27:19,979
Were the two of you very close?

200
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:29,403
He's psychotic.

201
00:27:29,479 --> 00:27:30,441
No shit.

202
00:27:30,518 --> 00:27:31,633
For his safety and for the public's,

203
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,903
I'm recommending that he be transferred
immediately to County Psychiatric--

204
00:27:34,018 --> 00:27:35,672
Fuck that!
That man is my prisoner.

205
00:27:35,749 --> 00:27:37,903
He's wanted in connection
with a laundry list of federal crimes.

206
00:27:37,979 --> 00:27:40,133
Hold on, gentlemen.
We're in my jurisdiction now.

207
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,556
You got a problem with that,
you talk to the local magistrate.

208
00:27:42,633 --> 00:27:44,441
- That man is my prisoner!
- The call has already been made.

209
00:27:44,518 --> 00:27:45,710
Don't fuck with my thing!

210
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:48,403
There's a team from the hospital
effecting the transfer immediately.

211
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:50,326
You're supposed to be
working with us on this, Chief.

212
00:27:50,403 --> 00:27:51,326
Not this time.

213
00:27:56,518 --> 00:28:00,133
This is just a little something
to keep you compliant.

214
00:28:02,018 --> 00:28:05,095
The usual dose for this sort of thing
is two, three hundred milligrams,

215
00:28:05,172 --> 00:28:09,979
but I think with a big,
strapping hybrid like yourself,

216
00:28:10,056 --> 00:28:12,479
I'll kick it up to a couple thousand.

217
00:28:12,556 --> 00:28:14,903
You don't have a problem
with needles, do ya?

218
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:18,595
There.

219
00:28:18,672 --> 00:28:20,056
That wasn't so bad, was it?

220
00:28:22,172 --> 00:28:23,979
Ooh, you're weak.

221
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,441
In need of your serum.

222
00:28:27,595 --> 00:28:29,095
That must be a bad feeling.

223
00:28:30,441 --> 00:28:32,903
I mean, who would've imagined

224
00:28:32,979 --> 00:28:35,941
that a mere human like me
could overpower you.

225
00:28:38,518 --> 00:28:40,479
You're one of them.

226
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:43,364
A familiar.

227
00:28:47,172 --> 00:28:49,249
Going on five years now.

228
00:28:52,787 --> 00:28:54,749
It's the endgame, Blade.

229
00:28:55,326 --> 00:28:57,710
All their plans are coming to fruition.

230
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:02,172
Why don't you just sit back
and enjoy the show?

231
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:12,941
I hate familiars.

232
00:29:22,133 --> 00:29:24,864
<i>It's why we're still alive, goddamn it.</i>

233
00:29:25,095 --> 00:29:27,287
<i>You're like a son to me.</i>

234
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:33,633
<i>Sorry I got old on ya.</i>

235
00:29:34,787 --> 00:29:38,979
<i>I see you alone,
surrounded by enemies.</i>

236
00:29:39,056 --> 00:29:40,941
<i>It breaks my heart.</i>

237
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,441
Hi, Blade.

238
00:30:07,518 --> 00:30:09,249
So glad to finally meet you.

239
00:30:09,326 --> 00:30:11,210
I am such a fan.

240
00:30:12,364 --> 00:30:14,403
I like your tattoos.

241
00:30:15,287 --> 00:30:16,787
Do they mean anything?

242
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,095
Stupid.

243
00:30:19,749 --> 00:30:21,364
Are you okay?

244
00:30:21,441 --> 00:30:23,095
Are you tired?

245
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:26,056
You're weak.

246
00:30:29,804 --> 00:30:32,611
We moved the humans around.

247
00:30:33,227 --> 00:30:34,804
Like pawns.

248
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,265
We used them...

249
00:30:38,034 --> 00:30:39,573
...to flush you out.

250
00:30:48,573 --> 00:30:49,842
You're not so big.

251
00:30:51,957 --> 00:30:53,765
You're all alone, Blade.

252
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,765
No one's gonna help you now.

253
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,534
- Evening, ladies.
- Hannibal King!

254
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,804
Wake up, Blade.
This is your rescue.

255
00:32:11,573 --> 00:32:12,611
Go!

256
00:32:58,265 --> 00:32:59,534
Freeze!

257
00:33:13,111 --> 00:33:14,227
Whistler!

258
00:33:15,381 --> 00:33:16,688
This way!

259
00:33:24,688 --> 00:33:26,073
Blade!

260
00:33:26,111 --> 00:33:27,573
You're dead!

261
00:33:28,227 --> 00:33:29,381
Get down!

262
00:33:36,457 --> 00:33:37,457
Blade.

263
00:33:44,804 --> 00:33:45,996
Hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

264
00:33:46,073 --> 00:33:47,034
Where are you going?

265
00:33:47,111 --> 00:33:48,727
Where the fuck is he going?

266
00:33:48,804 --> 00:33:50,957
This is supposed to be a rescue!

267
00:33:56,957 --> 00:33:58,034
Get back, get back!

268
00:34:01,073 --> 00:34:02,111
We're pinned down.

269
00:34:02,227 --> 00:34:03,304
I can't shoot around corners.

270
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:04,381
<i>I can.</i>

271
00:34:41,765 --> 00:34:43,611
Aah!

272
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:07,457
Okay. We're fucked.

273
00:35:07,534 --> 00:35:08,611
We're fine.

274
00:35:20,964 --> 00:35:22,964
Forgot my sword.

275
00:35:31,426 --> 00:35:33,041
Whoo! Come on!

276
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:48,387
Abby.

277
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:52,656
Aah!

278
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:56,233
We got him.

279
00:35:56,272 --> 00:35:57,849
We'll be there soon.

280
00:35:57,926 --> 00:35:59,618
Who the hell are you people?

281
00:35:59,656 --> 00:36:02,387
Well, my name is Hannibal  King.

282
00:36:02,464 --> 00:36:04,695
And this little hellion
right here is Abigail.

283
00:36:05,233 --> 00:36:06,502
Whistler's daughter.

284
00:36:18,618 --> 00:36:21,195
I thought the vampires
killed Whistler's family.

285
00:36:21,272 --> 00:36:24,656
They did.
I was born later out of wedlock.

286
00:36:26,656 --> 00:36:28,810
When I came of age,
I tracked my dad down,

287
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:30,233
and I told him I wanted in.

288
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:32,695
Been doing it ever since.

289
00:36:39,156 --> 00:36:41,118
Welcome to the honeycomb hideout.

290
00:36:42,195 --> 00:36:44,118
How do you bankroll this operation?

291
00:36:44,195 --> 00:36:45,618
I date a lot of older men.

292
00:36:46,964 --> 00:36:48,849
Come on, man, I'm joking.

293
00:36:48,926 --> 00:36:50,579
You met Dex.

294
00:36:50,656 --> 00:36:51,887
This is Hedges.

295
00:36:51,964 --> 00:36:54,733
Sommerfield-- she's the one who built
that new serum inhaler of yours.

296
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:59,772
That runt you saw earlier,
that was Sommerfield's daughter Zoe.

297
00:37:01,772 --> 00:37:03,502
We call ourselves the Nightstalkers.

298
00:37:04,195 --> 00:37:07,464
Hmm. Sounds like rejects
from a Saturday morning cartoon.

299
00:37:07,541 --> 00:37:11,195
We were gonna go with
the Care Bears, but, uh, that was taken.

300
00:37:14,618 --> 00:37:15,772
How many of you are there?

301
00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:16,926
There's enough.

302
00:37:16,964 --> 00:37:18,579
We operate in sleeper cells.

303
00:37:18,656 --> 00:37:20,964
When one goes down, another cell
activates to pick up the slack.

304
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:23,733
Consider us your reinforcements.

305
00:37:25,002 --> 00:37:27,387
What, you amateurs
are supposed to be helping me?

306
00:37:29,464 --> 00:37:30,849
You?

307
00:37:31,887 --> 00:37:33,156
Look at you.

308
00:37:33,233 --> 00:37:34,464
You're kids.

309
00:37:35,233 --> 00:37:36,772
You're not ready to roll with this.

310
00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:39,272
I mean, look at the way you're dressed.

311
00:37:40,272 --> 00:37:41,964
What, that's supposed to be tactical?

312
00:37:42,772 --> 00:37:44,887
What is this? What is that?
"Fuck you."

313
00:37:44,964 --> 00:37:46,310
It's a joke, huh?

314
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:49,310
What the fuck is wrong with y'all?
Y'all think this is a joke?

315
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:51,926
You think this is a fucking sitcom?

316
00:37:52,426 --> 00:37:54,887
Okay, first off, that's just rude.

317
00:37:54,964 --> 00:37:58,656
Second, I'm pretty sure
we saved your ass back there.

318
00:38:01,118 --> 00:38:02,810
I'm impressed.

319
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:05,887
Look, Blade, my father meant
for us to help you.

320
00:38:05,964 --> 00:38:08,772
Like it or not, we are all you got.

321
00:38:09,349 --> 00:38:11,964
What the hell makes you think
you know about hunting vampires?

322
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:15,618
Well, here's for starters.

323
00:38:16,349 --> 00:38:17,733
I used to be one.

324
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:20,464
Do I pass the audition?

325
00:38:22,195 --> 00:38:23,502
Rookies.

326
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,579
Fucking Hannibal King!

327
00:38:26,656 --> 00:38:30,233
I should've ripped his bleeding heart
out when I had the chance!

328
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:32,810
Ugh!

329
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:35,849
Ugh!

330
00:38:37,695 --> 00:38:39,387
We had Blade.

331
00:38:39,464 --> 00:38:40,772
We had him!

332
00:38:40,849 --> 00:38:42,118
Ugh!

333
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,502
And don't tell me "I told you so," Asher.

334
00:38:45,579 --> 00:38:47,426
What's wrong, half pint?
You need a time out?

335
00:38:47,502 --> 00:38:48,656
Blow me.

336
00:38:50,002 --> 00:38:52,118
We got caught with our pants down.

337
00:38:52,195 --> 00:38:53,502
Pants down?

338
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:56,618
They pretty much
fucking ass-raped us.

339
00:38:56,695 --> 00:38:58,079
Oh, you loved it.

340
00:38:58,156 --> 00:38:59,695
Has he been told?

341
00:39:00,426 --> 00:39:02,272
About your failure?

342
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:04,387
Yes.

343
00:39:06,195 --> 00:39:08,233
Maybe it's time I joined the game.

344
00:39:14,964 --> 00:39:18,118
You know the kind of woman
that just screams trouble?

345
00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:21,733
You see her and every warning bell
in your brain starts going off,

346
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:25,695
but you still manage to ask
for her number.

347
00:39:25,772 --> 00:39:27,656
Well, that's all I ever hook up with.

348
00:39:27,733 --> 00:39:29,426
<i>But this betty...</i>

349
00:39:30,349 --> 00:39:34,502
Whoa! She blew 'em all away
in the shitstorm sweepstakes.

350
00:39:35,002 --> 00:39:36,656
Her name is Danica Talos.

351
00:39:36,733 --> 00:39:38,233
You met her earlier.

352
00:39:38,349 --> 00:39:41,695
And unlike typical vampires,
her fangs are located in her vagina.

353
00:39:44,387 --> 00:39:45,887
Moving on.

354
00:39:45,964 --> 00:39:48,772
The man on her left
is her brother Asher,

355
00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:52,233
and this walking diaper stain
is Jarko Grimwood.

356
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:53,887
I picked Danica up in a bar

357
00:39:53,964 --> 00:39:56,079
and spent the next five years
playing hide-and-go-suck

358
00:39:56,195 --> 00:39:58,541
as her little vampire cabana boy.

359
00:39:58,618 --> 00:40:01,002
Eventually, Abigail found me.

360
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:04,541
Sommerfield managed to treat me
with a cure, and now I kill them.

361
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,849
And that's basically
turning a frown upside-down.

362
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:12,733
We need to pool our resources, Blade.

363
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:14,656
"We"?

364
00:40:16,656 --> 00:40:17,926
Yeah, we.

365
00:40:18,733 --> 00:40:20,464
He's come back.

366
00:40:22,926 --> 00:40:24,310
Take a look at this.

367
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:30,656
You gotta be kidding me.

368
00:40:33,972 --> 00:40:36,241
He is real.
BLADE BABA

369
00:40:35,897 --> 00:40:37,050
This is a piece of his armor.

370
00:40:37,127 --> 00:40:40,474
With it, we were able to extrapolate a
basic idea of what this fucker looked like.

371
00:40:40,589 --> 00:40:41,743
Check this out.

372
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:45,281
Dracula's only one
of the names he's gone by.

373
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:49,474
The Babylonians worshipped him
as Dagon, and now they call him Drake.

374
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:52,781
If you believe in the legends,
he was born in ancient Sumeria.

375
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:04,820
Nobody really knows the specifics
of his origin, but we do know this.

376
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,166
He was the first of his kind.

377
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:14,666
<i>The patriarch of hominus nocturna.</i>

378
00:41:19,858 --> 00:41:22,243
He was born perfect.

379
00:41:25,089 --> 00:41:29,858
And just like the great white shark,
this guy has never had to evolve.

380
00:41:30,435 --> 00:41:31,974
Forget the movies, forget the books.

381
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:33,666
There's no happy ending with this guy.

382
00:41:36,204 --> 00:41:38,281
He's been there,
moving behind the scenes,

383
00:41:38,358 --> 00:41:42,627
cutting a bloody fucking path
through the ages, until suddenly...

384
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,050
...just like that...

385
00:41:49,627 --> 00:41:51,820
...he up and disappeared.

386
00:41:51,935 --> 00:41:53,512
And then we heard a rumor.

387
00:41:53,589 --> 00:41:55,627
The vampires were searching for him.

388
00:41:55,743 --> 00:41:58,050
Some say he'd been sleeping
through the ages,

389
00:41:58,127 --> 00:42:01,089
that he'd retreated from a world
he'd become disgusted with.

390
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:05,243
And according to our information, they
found him in Iraq about six months ago.

391
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,050
And he was pissed.

392
00:42:30,974 --> 00:42:34,166
Don't try to use my name,
that's fatal

393
00:42:34,204 --> 00:42:36,781
Tried to claim my fame,
but that's fatal

394
00:42:36,858 --> 00:42:39,897
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal

395
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,781
Tried to claim my fame,
but that's fatal

396
00:42:42,858 --> 00:42:45,550
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal

397
00:42:45,627 --> 00:42:48,974
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal

398
00:43:01,935 --> 00:43:04,127
In the window...

399
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:06,474
You sell vampire merchandise?

400
00:43:08,704 --> 00:43:09,897
Uh, yeah.

401
00:43:09,974 --> 00:43:11,320
Look around.

402
00:43:11,397 --> 00:43:12,974
We might have a few things.

403
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,435
We've got Dracula lunchboxes.

404
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:18,781
Did you see those?

405
00:43:18,858 --> 00:43:22,320
There's bobble heads, key chains.

406
00:43:22,802 --> 00:43:25,417
We've got just about anything.

407
00:43:25,494 --> 00:43:28,225
Even vampire vibrators.

408
00:43:31,865 --> 00:43:34,634
Was there something special
you needed?

409
00:43:36,403 --> 00:43:37,480
Hey, guy.

410
00:43:38,326 --> 00:43:39,749
She's talkin' to ya.

411
00:43:47,172 --> 00:43:48,672
What?

412
00:43:48,749 --> 00:43:50,595
You wanna kiss me, pretty boy?

413
00:43:50,672 --> 00:43:53,057
Aah!

414
00:43:53,134 --> 00:43:54,211
No!

415
00:43:54,288 --> 00:43:56,326
Tried to claim my fame,
but that's fatal

416
00:43:56,365 --> 00:43:59,518
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal

417
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,749
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal

418
00:44:01,826 --> 00:44:06,749
Aah!

419
00:44:06,903 --> 00:44:10,057
Aah!

420
00:44:17,134 --> 00:44:20,403
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal

421
00:44:21,057 --> 00:44:22,134
Why wake up Drake now?

422
00:44:22,211 --> 00:44:24,211
That's exactly what we've been
trying to figure out.

423
00:44:24,288 --> 00:44:25,518
When I was under the fang,

424
00:44:25,595 --> 00:44:29,442
there used to be talk about
some kind of vampire final solution.

425
00:44:29,518 --> 00:44:31,403
But I could never figure out why
they'd want to destroy their food source.

426
00:44:31,518 --> 00:44:33,403
I mean, that makes no sense, right?

427
00:44:33,442 --> 00:44:34,980
They've always had plans
for the human race,

428
00:44:35,057 --> 00:44:37,442
and it seems likely
that whatever they're cooking up,

429
00:44:37,518 --> 00:44:39,249
Drake's return is part of it.

430
00:44:39,326 --> 00:44:40,249
Let's face it.

431
00:44:40,326 --> 00:44:42,365
We are fighting a losing battle here.

432
00:44:42,403 --> 00:44:44,865
So we kill a few hundred
of them a year-- big deal.

433
00:44:44,942 --> 00:44:47,788
There are thousands of them out there,
maybe tens of thousands.

434
00:44:47,865 --> 00:44:49,018
We need a new tactic.

435
00:44:49,095 --> 00:44:50,211
Like what?

436
00:44:50,326 --> 00:44:51,749
A biological weapon.

437
00:44:53,365 --> 00:44:54,788
For you sighted people...

438
00:44:57,326 --> 00:44:59,326
...here's a little show and tell.

439
00:44:59,403 --> 00:45:01,865
For the last year,
I've been working with synthesized DNA

440
00:45:01,942 --> 00:45:05,749
in order to create an artificial virus
targeted specifically at vampires.

441
00:45:05,826 --> 00:45:07,826
We're calling it DayStar.

442
00:45:07,903 --> 00:45:09,442
Think about it, Blade.

443
00:45:10,134 --> 00:45:12,557
We could wipe 'em all out
in one single move.

444
00:45:12,634 --> 00:45:14,288
So what's been holding you back?

445
00:45:14,326 --> 00:45:16,634
The lethality in vampires is still spotty.

446
00:45:16,711 --> 00:45:19,711
The bottom line is we need
a better strand of DNA to work with.

447
00:45:20,557 --> 00:45:22,480
We need Dracula's blood.

448
00:45:22,557 --> 00:45:25,057
Because Dracula is the progenitor
of the vampire race,

449
00:45:25,134 --> 00:45:27,442
his DNA is still pure.

450
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,942
It hasn't been diluted by a hundred
generations of selective mutation.

451
00:45:32,018 --> 00:45:37,595
We get his blood, we can boost
DayStar's viral efficacy to 100%.

452
00:45:37,672 --> 00:45:39,749
All the vampires go bye-bye.

453
00:45:40,903 --> 00:45:43,788
So, can we just
go right ahead and sign you up

454
00:45:43,865 --> 00:45:46,018
for one of our secret
Nightstalker decoder rings?

455
00:45:51,672 --> 00:45:52,672
Oh.

456
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:54,057
Holy shit.

457
00:45:54,095 --> 00:45:56,749
Um, gentlemen and hottie,

458
00:45:56,826 --> 00:45:59,518
uh, we have a wide assortment
of ass-kickery

459
00:45:59,595 --> 00:46:01,518
for your viewing pleasure today.

460
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:05,172
Electronic pistol-- comes in a variety
of tasty calibers.

461
00:46:06,134 --> 00:46:07,518
Explosive rounds.

462
00:46:07,595 --> 00:46:09,634
Yeah, but with
a concentrated burst of UV light

463
00:46:09,711 --> 00:46:11,595
instead of your standard hollow points.

464
00:46:11,672 --> 00:46:13,326
I call 'em sun dogs.

465
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:16,480
Hedges. Super-size me, sweetheart.

466
00:46:18,865 --> 00:46:21,172
This little pea shooter--
it's a modified version

467
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:23,865
of the Army's objective
individual combat weapon.

468
00:46:23,942 --> 00:46:25,595
Pick your poison-- sun dogs, stakes,

469
00:46:25,672 --> 00:46:27,134
heat-seeking mini rockets.

470
00:46:27,211 --> 00:46:30,403
Basically, whatever gets you hard,
this puppy'll pump 'em out.

471
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,326
Course, it doesn't have
the range of a sword, but...

472
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:36,018
Oh, God.

473
00:46:36,095 --> 00:46:38,403
Over here, we, um--

474
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,057
we call this the UV Arc.

475
00:46:42,095 --> 00:46:44,172
Whoa. Sorry.

476
00:46:44,249 --> 00:46:47,018
The two points are connected
by a powerful UV laser--

477
00:46:47,057 --> 00:46:49,018
- Hedges, I'll take it from here.
- Yes.

478
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:52,134
This bad boy is half as hot as the sun.

479
00:46:52,172 --> 00:46:55,403
It can cut through vampires
like a knife through butter.

480
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,672
We're still trying to sort out fact
from fiction when it comes to Dracula.

481
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:00,980
Turning into mist?
Kinda doubt it.

482
00:47:01,057 --> 00:47:04,403
General shape-shifting?
Maybe.

483
00:47:05,095 --> 00:47:07,595
Not into a bat or a wolf
or anything like that,

484
00:47:07,672 --> 00:47:11,442
but another human,
with practice, could be possible.

485
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:14,826
Because he wouldn't have
a traditional skeletal structure.

486
00:47:14,942 --> 00:47:18,057
Something more like a snake's,
with thousands of tiny bones--

487
00:47:18,134 --> 00:47:21,480
I have a-- I have a question
about that, Hedges.

488
00:47:21,557 --> 00:47:23,326
Have you ever been laid?

489
00:47:24,095 --> 00:47:25,788
Many times.

490
00:47:25,865 --> 00:47:26,903
With ladies.

491
00:47:28,749 --> 00:47:30,249
Time for a little pressure.

492
00:47:30,942 --> 00:47:33,518
The weakest link
in the vampire chain of command

493
00:47:33,557 --> 00:47:35,595
has always been their familiars.

494
00:47:35,672 --> 00:47:37,826
Since the vampires can't go out
in the daylight,

495
00:47:37,903 --> 00:47:40,595
they get the humans to do
all their dirty work.

496
00:47:40,672 --> 00:47:42,480
We bleed the wannabes...

497
00:47:43,172 --> 00:47:45,288
Sooner or later,
they'll take us right to the real.

498
00:47:45,942 --> 00:47:47,480
I got you some new wheels.

499
00:47:47,557 --> 00:47:48,942
You take care of it now.

500
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:56,179
She's making playlists.

501
00:47:57,025 --> 00:47:58,987
She likes to listen to MP3s
when she hunts.

502
00:47:59,102 --> 00:48:01,371
It's like her own
internal soundtrack, you know?

503
00:48:01,448 --> 00:48:05,333
Dark core, trip hop, whatever
kids are listening to these days.

504
00:48:06,025 --> 00:48:08,756
Me, I'm more of
a David Hasselhoff fan, you know?

505
00:48:10,525 --> 00:48:12,679
Come on, come on
like that, ya'll

506
00:48:14,602 --> 00:48:16,640
Come on, come on,
like that, y'all

507
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:19,564
Let me see you say ho

508
00:48:40,487 --> 00:48:42,564
Let me see you say ho

509
00:48:47,294 --> 00:48:51,025
Aah!

510
00:48:54,871 --> 00:48:56,602
Ah! Aah!

511
00:49:02,179 --> 00:49:04,564
Eventually, you know,
your head is gonna pop off.

512
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,871
Fuck! No, no!
Please, please! Please.

513
00:49:06,948 --> 00:49:08,102
Who's your handler?

514
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:09,679
I don't know my fucking handler.

515
00:49:09,756 --> 00:49:11,448
I swear. I swear!

516
00:49:11,525 --> 00:49:13,640
Oh, shit! Please! Please!

517
00:49:18,256 --> 00:49:19,679
<i>Oh, it's you.</i>

518
00:49:20,371 --> 00:49:21,410
I'll take that.

519
00:49:22,256 --> 00:49:23,179
Come on!

520
00:49:23,256 --> 00:49:24,717
Let's go! Come on!

521
00:49:28,756 --> 00:49:29,756
<i>Hello?</i>

522
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:30,910
<i>Hello?</i>

523
00:49:32,448 --> 00:49:34,794
Hello, this is Dr. Vance.
You paged me.

524
00:49:36,217 --> 00:49:37,140
It's for you.

525
00:49:37,217 --> 00:49:38,525
Yeah, go ahead.

526
00:49:39,102 --> 00:49:40,717
Hello?

527
00:49:40,794 --> 00:49:43,064
Aah!

528
00:49:43,833 --> 00:49:45,487
You know, at some point, you, uh,

529
00:49:45,564 --> 00:49:47,833
you might want to consider
sitting down with somebody.

530
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:49,794
You know? Have a little share time?

531
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:52,102
Kick back?
Get in touch with your inner child?

532
00:49:52,179 --> 00:49:53,140
That sort of thing?

533
00:49:53,217 --> 00:49:57,564
Also-- just a thought-- but you might
wanna consider blinking once in a while.

534
00:50:02,371 --> 00:50:06,256
I'm sorry, I, uh,
I ate a lot of sugar today.

535
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:23,871
Hey.

536
00:50:23,948 --> 00:50:26,102
You just can't walk in here like-- aah!

537
00:50:33,602 --> 00:50:34,717
Excuse me, sir.

538
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:42,871
Don't do that.

539
00:50:59,987 --> 00:51:00,948
Where's Vance?

540
00:51:01,025 --> 00:51:03,025
I'm sorry, but you can't see
Dr. Vance right now.

541
00:51:11,871 --> 00:51:12,987
Sit.

542
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:18,948
Can I, uh, can I help you?

543
00:51:18,987 --> 00:51:21,064
Remember me?
Time for payback.

544
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:23,371
All right, Vance,
what the hell do you know?

545
00:51:25,948 --> 00:51:26,987
Oh, Jesus.

546
00:51:27,064 --> 00:51:28,179
It's him.

547
00:51:28,256 --> 00:51:29,910
Abby. It's Drake!

548
00:51:35,871 --> 00:51:37,948
Aah!

549
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:47,448
So, you're the hunter they all fear.

550
00:51:47,525 --> 00:51:48,948
I had a feeling about you.

551
00:51:49,025 --> 00:51:50,217
Just shoot him!

552
00:51:50,294 --> 00:51:51,833
Go ahead, Blade.

553
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:53,179
Show me what you're made of.

554
00:51:53,256 --> 00:51:54,256
Aah!

555
00:53:19,833 --> 00:53:22,217
Aah! Oh, my God!

556
00:53:22,294 --> 00:53:24,333
He got my baby!

557
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:27,140
Aah! No! My baby!

558
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:26,448
Ah, careful, Daywalker.

559
00:54:26,525 --> 00:54:28,410
I've been told about you.

560
00:54:28,487 --> 00:54:30,448
Your weakness for humans.

561
00:54:30,525 --> 00:54:32,025
Why'd you kill Vance?

562
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,256
He'd outlived his purpose.

563
00:54:34,794 --> 00:54:35,833
He died a good death.

564
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:37,794
Quick, clean.

565
00:54:37,871 --> 00:54:39,794
I wouldn't know anything about that.

566
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:41,179
You will.

567
00:54:42,948 --> 00:54:45,448
How are you able to survive in sunlight?

568
00:54:45,487 --> 00:54:47,717
Haven't you read Stoker's fable?

569
00:54:48,679 --> 00:54:51,294
I was the first of the vampires.

570
00:54:52,679 --> 00:54:54,371
I am unique.

571
00:54:54,448 --> 00:54:55,871
So that's why they brought you back.

572
00:54:55,987 --> 00:54:57,256
Of course.

573
00:54:57,333 --> 00:55:00,294
They believe through me
they could become Daywalkers.

574
00:55:05,564 --> 00:55:07,025
Look at them down there.

575
00:55:07,102 --> 00:55:09,833
Scurrying around like insects.

576
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:13,910
They don't know anything about honor
or living by the sword,

577
00:55:13,987 --> 00:55:15,525
not like you and I do.

578
00:55:16,064 --> 00:55:19,410
Do you think they could ever grasp
what it means to be immortal?

579
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:20,756
You're not immortal.

580
00:55:21,487 --> 00:55:24,948
I must've heard hundreds of you rodents
make the same claim.

581
00:55:25,602 --> 00:55:28,371
Each one of them have tasted
the end of my sword.

582
00:55:28,448 --> 00:55:30,333
Perhaps I will too, then,

583
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:33,910
but I think it is more likely
the next time we meet,

584
00:55:33,948 --> 00:55:36,179
<i>you fall before mine.</i>

585
00:55:36,987 --> 00:55:38,179
Catch!

586
00:55:56,294 --> 00:55:57,679
Cootchie coo.

587
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:00,602
Did you see that guy?

588
00:56:00,679 --> 00:56:02,179
We're gonna lose, man.
We're gonna--

589
00:56:02,256 --> 00:56:04,410
Oh! God!

590
00:56:04,448 --> 00:56:06,333
We're gonna fucking lose!

591
00:56:06,792 --> 00:56:07,792
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on.

592
00:56:07,984 --> 00:56:09,561
What are you-- what is that?
What are you doing?

593
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,022
It's an elastic protein, okay?

594
00:56:11,099 --> 00:56:12,484
It's gonna stop the hemorrhaging.

595
00:56:12,561 --> 00:56:13,638
Okay.

596
00:56:13,715 --> 00:56:14,792
Is it gonna hurt?

597
00:56:14,869 --> 00:56:16,638
Yeah, it's gonna sting a little.

598
00:56:16,676 --> 00:56:18,099
Really?

599
00:56:20,292 --> 00:56:22,215
Fuck me!

600
00:56:22,292 --> 00:56:23,407
Aah!

601
00:56:27,099 --> 00:56:28,869
<i>I had a family once.</i>

602
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:31,869
<i>Wife, two daughters.</i>

603
00:56:36,061 --> 00:56:38,522
<i>Then a drifter came calling
one evening.</i>

604
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:41,022
<i>A vampire.</i>

605
00:56:42,292 --> 00:56:44,484
<i>He toyed with 'em first.</i>

606
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:50,138
<i>Tried to make me decide
which order they'd die in.</i>

607
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:53,522
<i>I've been doing this a long time.</i>

608
00:56:53,638 --> 00:56:55,792
<i>Since before you were born.</i>

609
00:56:56,869 --> 00:56:59,138
<i>I don 't want this life for you, Abby.</i>

610
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:41,599
Hey, Blade.

611
00:57:41,676 --> 00:57:44,215
I got a question for you.

612
00:57:44,292 --> 00:57:46,792
Say we're successful.
Say we wipe out all the vampires.

613
00:57:46,869 --> 00:57:48,369
What then,  huh?

614
00:57:49,099 --> 00:57:50,946
You ever ask yourself that?

615
00:57:51,984 --> 00:57:53,061
I mean, somehow,

616
00:57:53,138 --> 00:57:58,215
l-- I don't picture you teaching karate
at the local Y.

617
00:58:08,561 --> 00:58:10,138
He hates me, doesn't he?

618
00:58:10,215 --> 00:58:11,446
Yeah.

619
00:58:25,759 --> 00:58:27,105
Why do you do that?

620
00:58:27,875 --> 00:58:31,990
Because there's something bad
inside of me.

621
00:58:33,452 --> 00:58:35,336
This keeps it from getting out.

622
00:58:35,413 --> 00:58:37,413
Why can't you just be nice?

623
00:58:42,836 --> 00:58:45,067
Because the world isn't nice.

624
00:58:50,605 --> 00:58:52,067
I found where the vampires are working.

625
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:54,452
Biomedica Enterprises.

626
00:58:54,528 --> 00:58:57,221
They've been buying up
all sorts of supplies.

627
00:58:57,298 --> 00:58:58,798
Check it out.

628
00:58:59,759 --> 00:59:01,413
Taq polymerase,

629
00:59:01,490 --> 00:59:04,259
bone marrow growth supplement,

630
00:59:04,298 --> 00:59:07,182
genetic sequencing enzymes.

631
00:59:08,298 --> 00:59:09,836
You want a party favor?

632
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:11,375
Lucky seven.

633
00:59:11,452 --> 00:59:13,028
Silver hollow points.

634
00:59:13,067 --> 00:59:14,528
Done.

635
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:44,144
You wanted to see me?

636
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:46,259
We've got trouble.

637
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:48,990
Doing a little moonlighting, Chief?

638
00:59:49,028 --> 00:59:50,452
Shit!

639
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:03,105
What are you doing here?

640
01:00:03,644 --> 01:00:04,644
Talk.

641
01:00:06,259 --> 01:00:07,259
Talk.

642
01:00:10,836 --> 01:00:12,144
Spill it!

643
01:00:12,221 --> 01:00:13,375
You know what we're doing.

644
01:00:14,105 --> 01:00:15,452
What's inside?

645
01:00:16,798 --> 01:00:18,721
Aah!

646
01:00:22,913 --> 01:00:25,567
Now, what's behind door number one?

647
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:29,452
I can't tell you.
They-- they'll kill me.

648
01:00:29,528 --> 01:00:31,567
<i>Kill you?
Motherfucker, I'll kill you.</i>

649
01:00:31,644 --> 01:00:33,105
I'll just enjoy it better.

650
01:00:41,144 --> 01:00:42,567
You know the routine.

651
01:00:58,875 --> 01:01:00,067
Lights.

652
01:01:03,105 --> 01:01:04,182
God in Heaven.

653
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:21,105
What is this place?

654
01:01:22,028 --> 01:01:23,990
It's a blood farming facility.

655
01:01:29,913 --> 01:01:33,875
Vampires decided that hunting humans
on a piecemeal basis was...

656
01:01:33,913 --> 01:01:35,182
too inefficient.

657
01:01:36,144 --> 01:01:38,990
Why kill your prey
when you can keep them alive?

658
01:01:42,105 --> 01:01:44,028
Under optimal conditions,
a donor can generate

659
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:46,759
anywhere from 50 to 100
pints of blood.

660
01:01:47,336 --> 01:01:48,952
Productive.

661
01:01:50,605 --> 01:01:52,144
Where do you get all these people?

662
01:01:53,759 --> 01:01:56,528
They got processing centers
in every major city.

663
01:01:56,567 --> 01:01:58,682
At any given time, there's what,

664
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:02,336
two, three million homeless
wandering around America?

665
01:02:02,413 --> 01:02:04,221
They just pull 'em in off the streets.

666
01:02:06,144 --> 01:02:07,875
Nobody cares about them.

667
01:02:08,952 --> 01:02:11,336
We're doing this country
a service, really.

668
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:16,259
Vampire final solution.

669
01:02:17,221 --> 01:02:19,182
Are they aware?

670
01:02:19,259 --> 01:02:21,144
Do they feel anything?

671
01:02:21,875 --> 01:02:23,990
They're in a chemical-induced coma.

672
01:02:24,067 --> 01:02:25,528
They're brain dead.

673
01:02:29,182 --> 01:02:30,528
Look at this.

674
01:02:31,182 --> 01:02:32,836
This the future you want?

675
01:02:32,913 --> 01:02:37,105
<i>Don't you think that they have
a place for you in their future?</i>

676
01:02:37,798 --> 01:02:39,375
We don't have a choice!

677
01:02:40,336 --> 01:02:42,721
They're going to win.
Can't you see that?

678
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:44,413
He's come back!

679
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:46,644
There's nothing stopping them now.

680
01:02:46,759 --> 01:02:48,182
There's me.

681
01:02:49,298 --> 01:02:50,490
Go!

682
01:02:51,682 --> 01:02:53,798
You got 20 seconds.

683
01:02:56,528 --> 01:02:57,875
Twenty.

684
01:03:04,182 --> 01:03:06,413
Shutdown password-- what is it?

685
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:08,144
Harvest.

686
01:03:09,259 --> 01:03:10,221
Put it in.

687
01:03:25,605 --> 01:03:26,682
Let's go.

688
01:03:38,759 --> 01:03:41,567
Where'd you go?
See? I turned my back on you.

689
01:03:41,605 --> 01:03:44,221
- Oh! You win.
- One more, one more.

690
01:03:44,298 --> 01:03:47,913
"Now, Nome King,
having never tried to be good,

691
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,605
was very bad indeed."

692
01:03:51,682 --> 01:03:54,413
"Having decided to conquer
the land of Oz

693
01:03:54,452 --> 01:03:57,952
and to destroy the Emerald City..."

694
01:04:04,528 --> 01:04:06,028
This ain't no video game.

695
01:04:06,182 --> 01:04:07,490
This ain't no video game.

696
01:04:11,375 --> 01:04:12,375
Come on, now.

697
01:04:37,083 --> 01:04:40,006
Dude, you're dead.

698
01:04:47,314 --> 01:04:49,545
Mom, the lights are weird.

699
01:04:51,045 --> 01:04:52,314
What do you mean?

700
01:04:52,352 --> 01:04:53,814
They're going on and off.

701
01:04:57,122 --> 01:04:58,737
Guys?

702
01:05:00,122 --> 01:05:03,199
Zoe, I want you to go,
and I want you to hide, okay?

703
01:05:03,237 --> 01:05:05,699
Like we talked about. Go on.

704
01:07:36,793 --> 01:07:38,486
Something's not right.

705
01:08:51,557 --> 01:08:53,095
Zoe?

706
01:08:56,103 --> 01:08:57,257
Whistler.

707
01:10:10,603 --> 01:10:12,103
Use it.

708
01:10:14,449 --> 01:10:15,718
Use it.

709
01:10:19,564 --> 01:10:21,603
Use it.

710
01:10:26,218 --> 01:10:28,987
Aah!

711
01:10:41,834 --> 01:10:43,411
Back off, pooch.

712
01:10:46,911 --> 01:10:49,257
Jesus Christ!

713
01:10:50,641 --> 01:10:52,180
What the fuck?!

714
01:10:52,257 --> 01:10:53,487
Good dog.

715
01:10:53,564 --> 01:10:56,026
What the fuck?!

716
01:10:59,103 --> 01:11:00,295
His name's Pac-Man.

717
01:11:01,334 --> 01:11:05,103
We've been porting the vampire gene
into other species-- experimenting.

718
01:11:05,141 --> 01:11:08,987
You made a goddamn
vampire Pomeranian?

719
01:11:10,295 --> 01:11:11,487
Yeah.

720
01:11:17,295 --> 01:11:18,757
Precious, isn't he?

721
01:11:18,834 --> 01:11:20,987
Well, that depends who you ask,
because clearly,

722
01:11:21,026 --> 01:11:22,987
this dog has a bigger dick than you.

723
01:11:24,064 --> 01:11:27,949
And when the fuck
did you see my dick, fuckface?

724
01:11:29,141 --> 01:11:30,757
Ow!

725
01:11:30,795 --> 01:11:33,295
<i>I was talking to her!</i>

726
01:11:36,911 --> 01:11:38,641
Poor King.

727
01:11:39,526 --> 01:11:42,680
You look so distraught!

728
01:11:46,834 --> 01:11:48,257
Give me that chair.

729
01:11:56,975 --> 01:11:59,090
You're tasting a little bland, lover.

730
01:11:59,128 --> 01:12:02,013
Are you getting enough
fatty acids in your diet?

731
01:12:02,052 --> 01:12:04,898
Have you tried lake trout?

732
01:12:04,975 --> 01:12:06,628
Mackerel?

733
01:12:06,705 --> 01:12:09,936
How about you take
a sugar-frosted fuck

734
01:12:10,013 --> 01:12:12,013
off the end of my dick?

735
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:16,936
And how about everyone here
not saying the word "dick" anymore?

736
01:12:17,013 --> 01:12:19,667
It provokes my envy.

737
01:12:27,128 --> 01:12:28,975
Tell us about Blade, King.

738
01:12:29,052 --> 01:12:31,628
What's this weapon
he's been planning?

739
01:12:32,205 --> 01:12:34,128
I can tell you two things.

740
01:12:35,705 --> 01:12:41,436
One...your hairdo is ridiculous.

741
01:12:42,475 --> 01:12:47,552
Two, I ate a lot of garlic,
and I just farted.

742
01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:49,052
Silent but deadly.

743
01:12:50,475 --> 01:12:52,744
Spit it out, you fucking fruitcake!

744
01:12:52,821 --> 01:12:53,782
All right! Fuck!

745
01:12:53,859 --> 01:12:55,513
I'll tell you about the weapon.

746
01:13:03,590 --> 01:13:05,013
It's a new flavor crystal formula.

747
01:13:05,052 --> 01:13:06,859
Twice the chocolaty goodness,
half the calories.

748
01:13:06,936 --> 01:13:08,667
Plus, it helps
prevent tooth decay. There.

749
01:13:17,859 --> 01:13:19,859
You're brave, King.

750
01:13:19,936 --> 01:13:21,321
I'll give you that.

751
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:26,128
But underneath all that swagger,

752
01:13:26,205 --> 01:13:29,013
I know what you really fear.

753
01:13:29,513 --> 01:13:32,859
What would hurt you
more than anything else.

754
01:13:45,705 --> 01:13:50,398
You don't want to go back
to being one of us, do you?

755
01:13:58,436 --> 01:14:02,321
I'm gonna bite you again, King.

756
01:14:02,398 --> 01:14:06,975
And I'm gonna leave you here
while you turn.

757
01:14:07,013 --> 01:14:10,667
I'm going to watch you day after day

758
01:14:10,705 --> 01:14:14,936
as the thirst
keeps building and building.

759
01:14:17,282 --> 01:14:18,821
And then,

760
01:14:18,898 --> 01:14:22,475
when you can't stand it anymore...

761
01:14:27,744 --> 01:14:30,398
...I'm gonna bring the little girl in here...

762
01:14:32,013 --> 01:14:33,744
...for you to feed on.

763
01:14:35,552 --> 01:14:37,705
Would you like that, King?

764
01:14:39,205 --> 01:14:42,244
Would you enjoy taking her life?

765
01:14:57,667 --> 01:14:59,590
Now we're getting somewhere, my pet.

766
01:15:20,859 --> 01:15:22,090
Are you all right?

767
01:15:23,359 --> 01:15:25,244
Yeah. I'll be fine.

768
01:15:27,782 --> 01:15:29,744
Don't let it turn inward.

769
01:15:31,859 --> 01:15:34,898
I already has...

770
01:16:31,037 --> 01:16:32,268
He's one of ours.

771
01:16:32,345 --> 01:16:33,768
My name is Caulder.

772
01:16:33,845 --> 01:16:35,806
I'll be your driver this evening.

773
01:16:45,229 --> 01:16:47,614
Sommerfield left you a video message.

774
01:16:51,498 --> 01:16:53,652
<i>If you're watching this,
I'm already dead.</i>

775
01:16:54,537 --> 01:16:59,037
<i>If Zoe's alive, I want you to promise me
that you'll take care of her, okay?</i>

776
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:01,652
<i>I've been reading her
the Oz books every night.</i>

777
01:17:02,806 --> 01:17:05,229
<i>We just started reading
The Emerald City of Oz.</i>

778
01:17:05,306 --> 01:17:07,614
<i>You know, the one
with the Nome King?</i>

779
01:17:10,191 --> 01:17:13,883
<i>I think I've managed to cultivate
a workable strain of the DayStar virus.</i>

780
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:16,998
<i>As a precaution, I transmitted
the genetic sequence to Caulder</i>

781
01:17:17,075 --> 01:17:19,152
<i>in case our main stock was destroyed.</i>

782
01:17:19,921 --> 01:17:21,960
<i>In order for it
to achieve maximum lethality,</i>

783
01:17:22,037 --> 01:17:24,229
<i>you're gonna need to interfuse it
with Drake's blood.</i>

784
01:17:25,075 --> 01:17:28,883
<i>Now, if it works,
every vampire in the immediate vicinity</i>

785
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:30,421
<i>should die almost instantly.</i>

786
01:17:31,614 --> 01:17:33,075
<i>There's one other thing.</i>

787
01:17:33,614 --> 01:17:36,268
<i>Blade, you need to know</i>

788
01:17:36,345 --> 01:17:38,883
<i>that there's a chance
the virus could destroy you, too.</i>

789
01:17:38,921 --> 01:17:40,152
<i>Because you're a hybrid,</i>

790
01:17:40,191 --> 01:17:43,460
<i>l-- I'm not sure if your immune system
will be able to tolerate it.</i>

791
01:17:44,614 --> 01:17:48,806
<i>I'm sorry. We just didn 't have
enough time to properly test it.</i>

792
01:17:51,268 --> 01:17:54,729
So, shall we take a look
at the plague arrow?

793
01:17:55,768 --> 01:17:59,152
I only had time to fabricate
a small amount of DayStar.

794
01:17:59,998 --> 01:18:04,806
However, I was able to outfit it.

795
01:18:05,998 --> 01:18:08,075
A compressed gas projectile...

796
01:18:09,383 --> 01:18:15,037
...that can be shot from one
of the four-barrel rifles or a bow.

797
01:18:17,421 --> 01:18:20,883
Either way, you must be sure
that the shot counts.

798
01:18:21,768 --> 01:18:24,152
You would simply not have enough
for a second shot.

799
01:18:33,614 --> 01:18:35,345
Do you know who I am?

800
01:18:35,806 --> 01:18:37,383
You're the Nome King.

801
01:18:38,806 --> 01:18:39,806
Ah.

802
01:18:39,921 --> 01:18:41,845
The Nome King.

803
01:18:41,921 --> 01:18:43,806
How sweet.

804
01:18:43,883 --> 01:18:46,883
Tell me, child,
do you want to die?

805
01:18:46,998 --> 01:18:48,421
I'm not afraid.

806
01:18:48,498 --> 01:18:49,921
I'll go to Heaven.

807
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:51,921
There is no Heaven.

808
01:18:51,998 --> 01:18:55,268
No God, no angels.

809
01:18:55,345 --> 01:18:58,460
The only thing in your future
is nothingness.

810
01:18:58,537 --> 01:19:00,729
But what if you could change that?

811
01:19:00,806 --> 01:19:03,614
What if you could
remain a child forever?

812
01:19:04,421 --> 01:19:05,883
Wouldn't you like that?

813
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,845
Wouldn't you accept that gift?

814
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:11,998
My friends are coming to kill you.

815
01:19:33,729 --> 01:19:35,768
This blood

816
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:46,575
Wake the night!

817
01:19:54,191 --> 01:19:56,498
It's gonna wake the night

818
01:20:02,114 --> 01:20:03,614
It's gonna wake the night

819
01:20:03,691 --> 01:20:05,383
Wake the night!

820
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:07,268
This blood

821
01:20:10,345 --> 01:20:11,537
This blood

822
01:20:11,614 --> 01:20:13,921
It's gonna wake the night

823
01:20:13,998 --> 01:20:16,075
This blood

824
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:18,729
This blood

825
01:20:18,806 --> 01:20:21,345
It's gonna wake the night!

826
01:20:34,883 --> 01:20:37,345
- This blood
- Wake the night!

827
01:20:44,306 --> 01:20:45,921
It's gonna wake the night

828
01:20:52,998 --> 01:20:54,960
- This blood
- Wake the night!

829
01:21:02,421 --> 01:21:04,037
Wake the night!

830
01:21:04,114 --> 01:21:05,537
This blood

831
01:21:06,652 --> 01:21:08,845
This blood

832
01:21:08,883 --> 01:21:10,998
It's gonna wake the night!

833
01:21:20,018 --> 01:21:22,056
Gonna be sorry you did that.

834
01:21:22,133 --> 01:21:23,095
Why?

835
01:21:25,441 --> 01:21:27,710
Nobody's coming for you, Kingshit.

836
01:21:29,749 --> 01:21:30,710
Sure they are.

837
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:32,556
God--

838
01:21:32,633 --> 01:21:37,941
See, one of the things you fuckheads
need to know about us Nightstalkers

839
01:21:37,979 --> 01:21:43,133
is that when you join our club, you get
all sorts of groovy little door prizes.

840
01:21:43,210 --> 01:21:47,787
And one of them is this nifty little tracking
node surgically implanted in your body.

841
01:21:49,749 --> 01:21:50,864
- Bullshit.
- Yeah.

842
01:21:54,018 --> 01:21:56,056
See, when one of us goes missing...

843
01:21:57,287 --> 01:21:59,941
...the others,
they just dial up the satellite

844
01:22:00,018 --> 01:22:01,672
which is in space.

845
01:22:01,710 --> 01:22:03,287
And then presto.

846
01:22:04,056 --> 01:22:05,902
Instant cavalry.

847
01:22:06,864 --> 01:22:08,133
You like that, huh?

848
01:22:09,402 --> 01:22:10,710
Go fuck your sister.

849
01:22:10,787 --> 01:22:12,633
Okay, King.

850
01:22:13,825 --> 01:22:17,133
Where is this tracking node of yours?

851
01:22:18,095 --> 01:22:19,633
It's in my left ass check.

852
01:22:20,979 --> 01:22:22,210
Fine.

853
01:22:22,249 --> 01:22:23,941
It's in my right ass cheek.

854
01:22:25,633 --> 01:22:27,672
Okay, I'm-- okay, seriously, now.

855
01:22:28,749 --> 01:22:32,018
It's in the meat of my butt,
just below the Hello Kitty tattoo.

856
01:22:35,441 --> 01:22:38,249
Seriously, just pull down
my tighty-whities and see for yourself.

857
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:39,249
Enough!

858
01:22:39,325 --> 01:22:40,979
It's not funny anymore!

859
01:22:41,056 --> 01:22:43,556
No, it's not,
you horse-humping bitch!

860
01:22:43,595 --> 01:22:45,941
But it will be a few seconds from now.

861
01:22:47,210 --> 01:22:50,018
See, that tickle that you're feeling
in the back of your throat right now...

862
01:22:51,441 --> 01:22:54,018
...that's atomized colloidal silver.

863
01:22:54,095 --> 01:22:56,595
It's being pumped through
the building's air conditioning system,

864
01:22:56,672 --> 01:22:59,287
you cock-juggling thundercunt!

865
01:23:07,979 --> 01:23:11,018
Which means the fat lady
should be singing

866
01:23:11,095 --> 01:23:14,633
right about now!

867
01:23:22,441 --> 01:23:24,018
This is awkward.

868
01:23:25,787 --> 01:23:27,479
Do you have a cell phone?

869
01:23:50,951 --> 01:23:54,028
Um...a little help here.

870
01:24:34,759 --> 01:24:36,682
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

871
01:24:36,759 --> 01:24:38,182
- Where's Zoe?
- Drake's got her.

872
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:39,528
Okay.

873
01:24:43,297 --> 01:24:44,336
Thank you.

874
01:24:45,528 --> 01:24:47,066
I brought your toys.

875
01:24:47,951 --> 01:24:49,297
Try to keep up.

876
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:08,989
Aah!

877
01:26:52,297 --> 01:26:53,605
Abby!

878
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:54,682
Hey.

879
01:26:56,143 --> 01:26:57,682
You okay?

880
01:26:57,759 --> 01:26:59,759
Okay. Let's get you out of here.

881
01:26:59,874 --> 01:27:01,028
Watch out!

882
01:27:20,989 --> 01:27:22,912
Fuck me.

883
01:27:25,566 --> 01:27:28,297
Oh, fuck me sideways!

884
01:27:32,066 --> 01:27:33,105
Oh, yeah.

885
01:27:33,682 --> 01:27:35,912
He's a cute little guy, aren't ya?

886
01:27:35,951 --> 01:27:37,105
Good little puppies.

887
01:27:37,182 --> 01:27:39,066
Yeah, you're gonna stay.

888
01:27:39,105 --> 01:27:40,566
You stay.

889
01:27:40,605 --> 01:27:42,720
Oh. There's a pretty smile.

890
01:27:43,297 --> 01:27:44,336
Yeah.

891
01:27:44,412 --> 01:27:46,066
I'm going to, uh...

892
01:28:24,989 --> 01:28:26,297
Hey, dickface.

893
01:28:26,336 --> 01:28:28,143
You seen my dog?

894
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:30,182
Have you tried the lobby?

895
01:28:32,412 --> 01:28:33,451
Thank you.

896
01:28:39,182 --> 01:28:40,374
Fuck...

897
01:28:40,412 --> 01:28:41,528
Come on, King.

898
01:28:41,605 --> 01:28:42,912
...this.

899
01:28:59,797 --> 01:29:01,105
Blade.

900
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:03,797
Ready to die?

901
01:29:06,374 --> 01:29:08,451
I was born ready, motherfucker.

902
01:29:11,143 --> 01:29:12,643
Motherfucker.

903
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:14,182
I like that.

904
01:29:15,259 --> 01:29:17,451
Aah!

905
01:30:13,066 --> 01:30:14,797
Aah!

906
01:30:28,643 --> 01:30:29,951
Aah!

907
01:30:38,528 --> 01:30:40,412
Aah!

908
01:30:46,792 --> 01:30:48,523
You broke my arm!

909
01:32:39,869 --> 01:32:42,253
Aah!

910
01:34:28,869 --> 01:34:31,215
Are you ready to die, motherfucker?

911
01:35:52,692 --> 01:35:53,962
Give it up.

912
01:35:54,077 --> 01:35:55,500
Come on.
Give it up, King.

913
01:35:56,039 --> 01:35:58,231
Give it up.
Give it up.

914
01:35:58,269 --> 01:35:59,423
Give it up.

915
01:36:25,462 --> 01:36:26,808
Hang in there, kitten.

916
01:36:26,846 --> 01:36:28,192
I'll get help.

917
01:36:38,231 --> 01:36:40,269
Funny, isn't it?

918
01:36:40,769 --> 01:36:44,885
All this time, my people were trying
to create a new kind of vampire,

919
01:36:44,962 --> 01:36:48,039
when one already exists.

920
01:36:49,616 --> 01:36:51,231
I don't need to survive.

921
01:36:51,346 --> 01:36:54,385
The future of our race rests with you.

922
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:57,577
You fought with honor.

923
01:36:57,616 --> 01:36:59,308
I respect that.

924
01:37:00,731 --> 01:37:02,616
Allow me a parting gift.

925
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,462
But remember this.

926
01:37:06,269 --> 01:37:09,385
Sooner or later,

927
01:37:09,462 --> 01:37:12,808
the thirst always wins.

928
01:40:32,419 --> 01:40:33,957
Y o, yo

929
01:40:34,034 --> 01:40:35,957
It's the feast of the blood

930
01:40:36,034 --> 01:40:37,534
Unleash the beast within

931
01:40:37,573 --> 01:40:40,380
I walk around with the strength
of a hundred men

932
01:40:41,111 --> 01:40:42,919
You best run before I count to ten

933
01:40:42,996 --> 01:40:46,034
Blood dripping from my canine
like a fountain pen

934
01:40:46,111 --> 01:40:48,842
The shape-shifting mirror image
flash phototype

935
01:40:48,919 --> 01:40:51,842
The everlasting vision,
the red battle type

936
01:41:21,457 --> 01:41:24,265
Try to use my name,
that's fatal

937
01:41:24,342 --> 01:41:27,150
Tried to claim my fame,
but that's fatal

938
01:41:27,188 --> 01:41:30,073
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal

939
01:41:30,150 --> 01:41:33,227
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal

940
01:41:33,304 --> 01:41:35,150
Walk with me,
come on, walk with me

941
01:41:35,227 --> 01:41:37,996
Come on, walk with me,
come on, walk with me

942
01:41:38,150 --> 01:41:41,034
Come on, walk with me,
come on, walk with me

943
01:41:41,111 --> 01:41:44,150
Come on, walk with me,
walk with me

944
01:41:44,227 --> 01:41:47,496
I strike back with a vengeance,
The father, your descendants

945
01:41:47,573 --> 01:41:50,611
And I can't be deflected
by your silver cross pendants

946
01:41:50,688 --> 01:41:53,419
Bloody holy water,
you made the false images

947
01:41:53,457 --> 01:41:56,304
What's waiting for the sickle?
You're like the nemesis

948
01:41:56,342 --> 01:41:59,380
Sting like the scorpion,
strike with the force again

949
01:41:59,457 --> 01:42:02,765
My blood in those
who revitalize the corpse I'm in

950
01:42:02,842 --> 01:42:05,650
And the last thing,
they said the dead would walk again

951
01:42:05,727 --> 01:42:08,650
The blind, deaf and the dumb
will talk again

952
01:42:08,688 --> 01:42:11,073
Try to use my name,
that's fatal

953
01:42:11,188 --> 01:42:14,457
Trying to claim my fame,
that's fatal

954
01:42:14,534 --> 01:42:17,034
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal

955
01:42:17,111 --> 01:42:20,034
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal

956
01:42:56,227 --> 01:42:59,034
You don't even know me

957
01:42:59,073 --> 01:43:01,919
You can't even see me

958
01:43:01,957 --> 01:43:04,457
Friendlier than daylight

959
01:43:04,534 --> 01:43:07,304
Now I'm back,
now I'm back again

960
01:43:07,380 --> 01:43:10,150
Don't be scared, baby

961
01:43:10,227 --> 01:43:13,304
Can't you see I'm thirsty?

962
01:43:13,380 --> 01:43:15,880
Friends of the daylight

963
01:43:15,996 --> 01:43:18,996
Let me drink,
let me drink, my friend

964
01:43:19,073 --> 01:43:21,727
Don't be scared, baby

965
01:43:21,804 --> 01:43:24,573
Don't be afraid

966
01:43:24,611 --> 01:43:27,342
Friends of the daylight

967
01:43:27,419 --> 01:43:30,304
And I'm back,
and I'm back again

968
01:43:30,342 --> 01:43:33,150
Never going nowhere

969
01:43:33,227 --> 01:43:36,304
You can't run from me

970
01:43:36,380 --> 01:43:38,919
Day or night, baby

971
01:43:38,996 --> 01:43:42,842
Can I drink,
can I drink again?

972
01:43:43,304 --> 01:43:45,111
Yeah

973
01:43:45,534 --> 01:43:49,880
Yeah

974
01:43:50,380 --> 01:43:53,880
Can we drink,
can we drink, my friend?

975
01:43:53,957 --> 01:43:56,650
Don't be scared, baby

976
01:43:56,804 --> 01:43:59,188
Don't be scared, baby

977
01:43:59,227 --> 01:44:01,727
Can't you see I'm thirsty?

978
01:44:01,804 --> 01:44:04,073
And I'm back,
and I'm back again

979
01:44:04,150 --> 01:44:06,688
First things first, man,
you can't fight the thirst

980
01:44:06,765 --> 01:44:09,573
You can't call the doctor,
you can't call the nurse

981
01:44:09,650 --> 01:44:12,265
You got that Louis logo
on the side of your purse

982
01:44:12,342 --> 01:44:15,419
And those tight minis
about to make me burst

983
01:44:15,496 --> 01:44:18,304
I can't think,
let me sink into your jugular

984
01:44:18,342 --> 01:44:21,150
Come have a drink
with the thirsty love guzzler

985
01:44:21,188 --> 01:44:23,573
From the dark side,
baby, don't be afraid

986
01:44:23,611 --> 01:44:26,842
You can't fight the thirst
nor escape the plague

987
01:44:26,919 --> 01:44:29,957
I've been scopin' ya
hoping you'd be open to

988
01:44:29,996 --> 01:44:32,804
Take a sip of the potion
'cause it's overdue

989
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:35,765
It's not your ordinary,
it's a special brew

990
01:44:35,842 --> 01:44:38,573
In the heat of the night,
I will rescue you

991
01:44:39,996 --> 01:44:42,380
Never going nowhere

992
01:44:42,457 --> 01:44:45,534
You can't run from me

993
01:44:45,573 --> 01:44:48,265
Day or night, baby

994
01:44:48,304 --> 01:44:51,957
Can I drink,
can I drink again?

995
01:44:52,727 --> 01:44:54,150
Yeah

996
01:44:54,727 --> 01:44:59,150
Yeah

997
01:44:59,688 --> 01:45:03,073
Can we drink,
can we drink, my friend?

998
01:45:03,150 --> 01:45:05,688
Don't be scared, baby

999
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:08,688
Don't be scared, baby

1000
01:45:08,765 --> 01:45:11,227
Can't you see I'm thirsty?

1001
01:45:11,304 --> 01:45:14,380
And I'm back,
and I'm back again

1002
01:45:14,457 --> 01:45:16,765
Allow me a parting gift.

1003
01:45:17,804 --> 01:45:19,534
But remember this.

1004
01:45:20,227 --> 01:45:23,342
Sooner or later,

1005
01:45:23,419 --> 01:45:26,804
the thirst will always win.

1006
01:45:46,073 --> 01:45:48,919
And I'm back,
and I'm back again
