00:56:18,657 --> 00:56:21,496
Aha.
Hope you're wearing one now.

984
00:56:21,537 --> 00:56:24,536
- How long have you known?
- Since forever.

985
00:56:24,577 --> 00:56:26,896
Mom made me swear
not to mention it.

986
00:56:26,937 --> 00:56:29,656
So now we're even !

987
00:56:29,697 --> 00:56:31,816
CARMEN: Oh, now you've done it!

988
00:56:31,856 --> 00:56:34,935
I knew this was gonna happen !

989
00:56:34,976 --> 00:56:37,415
We're gonna crash
if you don't do something !

990
00:56:40,175 --> 00:56:42,176
CARMEN: You did that
on purpose, you kamikaze!

991
00:56:42,215 --> 00:56:44,895
JUNI: But now it's balanced!

992
00:56:44,935 --> 00:56:46,215
Landing gear.

993
00:56:48,695 --> 00:56:51,014
No landing gear.
We're gonna crash !

994
00:56:51,974 --> 00:56:54,255
CARMEN:
Nope. We're gonna drop.

995
00:56:54,294 --> 00:56:55,654
Get your regulator ready.

996
00:57:12,333 --> 00:57:15,613
Com systems check.
Can you hear me?

997
00:57:15,652 --> 00:57:16,612
Yeah.

998
00:57:16,652 --> 00:57:20,332
Let's try that cave over there.

999
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:24,612
CARMEN:
The water's warmer in here.

1000
00:57:24,652 --> 00:57:26,732
JUNI: Oh, I just peed.

1001
00:57:26,771 --> 00:57:29,012
- Ecch.
- Sorry.

1002
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:49,890
A Thumb-thumb.

1003
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:51,570
A real live--

1004
00:58:13,249 --> 00:58:16,488
What did you do to him?

1005
00:58:16,528 --> 00:58:18,488
Machete's electroshock gumballs.

1006
00:58:18,528 --> 00:58:21,487
It says long lasting.
But I don't trust wrappers.

1007
00:58:32,206 --> 00:58:33,127
Come on.

1008
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:43,286
CARMEN:
Over here. Juni, come on.

1009
00:58:46,926 --> 00:58:48,685
What are you doing?

1010
00:58:48,726 --> 00:58:50,246
World's smallest cameras.

1011
00:58:50,286 --> 00:58:53,525
I just placed them
all over the main hallways.

1012
00:58:54,645 --> 00:58:56,725
- Sweet.
- Thanks.

Thumb-thumbs and Fooglies
coming up the south hall.

1014
00:59:03,924 --> 00:59:05,324
Got an idea?

1015
00:59:05,365 --> 00:59:06,884
Yeah.

1016
00:59:19,283 --> 00:59:20,883
JUNI: Agent Donnagon?

1017
00:59:20,923 --> 00:59:24,603
[Speaking backwards]

1018
00:59:24,643 --> 00:59:26,802
Where's my mom and dad?

1020
00:59:30,802 --> 00:59:32,002
Thanks.

1021

- I got it.
- What'd he say?

1022
00:59:37,042 --> 00:59:37,962
I'll play it backwards.

1023
00:59:38,002 --> 00:59:40,162
DONNAGON:
They're in the dungeon. Hurry.

1024
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:41,601
See if they know
where the Brain room is.

1025
00:59:45,321 --> 00:59:46,681
Uh-oh.

1026
00:59:46,721 --> 00:59:49,001
Thumb-thumbs--everywhere.

1027
00:59:49,041 --> 00:59:50,441
Let's see if they like bubbles.

1028
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:05,080
We'll be back for you,
fellow agents.

1029
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,559
Sknaht!

[Jabbering excitedly]

MINION ON P.A.:
All robots please report...

1032
01:00:10,479 --> 01:00:14,279
to docking bays four, five,
and six for immediate loading.

1033
01:00:14,359 --> 01:00:16,718
This is the ventilator shaft
here.

1034
01:00:16,759 --> 01:00:19,758
CARMEN: But the dungeon's on
the other side of the castle.

1035
01:00:19,799 --> 01:00:22,398
How do we get there undetected?

1036
01:00:33,958 --> 01:00:35,598
[Whispering] I think
they've gotten smarter...

1037

1038
01:00:36,838 --> 01:00:38,157
Intruder.

1039
01:00:38,197 --> 01:00:40,877

intruder, intruder,

1041
01:00:49,756 --> 01:00:52,196
- Can you make it?
- I think so.

1042
01:00:52,236 --> 01:00:54,596
Come on. Come on !

1043
01:00:55,556 --> 01:00:59,036
- Carmen !
- Find Mom and Dad !

1044
01:01:09,234 --> 01:01:10,634
I hope this leads
to the dungeon.

1045
01:01:18,634 --> 01:01:19,794
FLOOP: You there.

1046
01:01:19,834 --> 01:01:23,714
What's that on your hands?

1047
01:01:27,034 --> 01:01:29,313
FLOOP: Warts, aren't they?

1048
01:01:29,354 --> 01:01:30,793
Oh, great.

1049
01:01:30,833 --> 01:01:33,793
From sweaty hands sprout warts.

1050
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:36,672
FLOOP: Do you know why
you have sweaty hands?

1051
01:01:36,713 --> 01:01:38,752
From being scared all the time.

1052
01:01:41,033 --> 01:01:43,352
You don't look
very scared to me.

1053
01:01:43,432 --> 01:01:46,792
That's because I'm mad.
You kidnapped my parents...

1054
01:01:46,872 --> 01:01:50,791
made psycho robot children,
and swallowed up my sister.

1055
01:01:50,831 --> 01:01:52,552
But I didn't want any of that.

1056

- I thought Floop was a genius.
- You did?

Agent Cortez.

1061

Wonderful to see you again.

1062
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:17,070
- You know him?
- Yeah.

1063
01:02:17,149 --> 01:02:18,990
He was on
the Third Brain Project...

1064
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:21,389
until I noticed
he was trying to inject...

1065
01:02:21,429 --> 01:02:24,109
his own ideas into the system.

1066
01:02:24,149 --> 01:02:25,789
I turned him in.

1067
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:28,269
He was thrown out of the OSS.

1068

MINION: I'm afraid I'm not
nearly the artist Floop is.

1069
01:02:32,309 --> 01:02:33,868
But not to worry.

1070
01:02:33,908 --> 01:02:36,428
I have something else in mind.

1071
01:02:40,068 --> 01:02:42,627
What do you think you're going
to accomplish by doing this?

1072
01:02:42,667 --> 01:02:44,307
Well, you see, Mrs. Cortez...

1073
01:02:44,348 --> 01:02:47,587
I've always been methodical,
goal oriented.

1074
01:02:47,627 --> 01:02:48,987
Psychotically so.

1075
01:02:49,027 --> 01:02:51,387
I'm not afraid of you, Alex.

1076
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:53,466
So I think it's refreshing...

1077
01:02:53,507 --> 01:02:56,226
to every once in a while...

1078

about your little brats.

to see you.

on other business, sir.

is now within your grasp.

- So Minion is the evil one.
- Yes.

FLOOP: But I will be blamed.

You have every reason
to be disappointed in me.

So what would you do if you
could shut this thing off...

01:04:14,101 --> 01:04:15,500
and get out of here?

1098

It's impossible. It can only be
turned off from the outside.

1099
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:20,740
Just suppose.

1100
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:23,180
I'd stop Minion.

so I'm gonna help you,
then you're gonna help me.

I know it needs
something desperately...

everything now, OK?

I can teach the children...

1301
01:15:57,367 --> 01:16:00,086
but what you taught me.

1302
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:02,246
You won today, Juni,
and not because...

1303
01:16:02,286 --> 01:16:04,166
you were the biggest
or the strongest...

1304
01:16:04,206 --> 01:16:08,206
but because you were
pure of heart and of mind.

1305
01:16:09,686 --> 01:16:12,005
And now the robots
have learned that as well.

1306
01:16:12,086 --> 01:16:14,246
Thank you.

1307
01:16:14,286 --> 01:16:17,885
We went on the old-fashioned
adventure I always wanted.

1308
01:16:17,925 --> 01:16:20,285
And we didn't do
one thing right.

1309
01:16:20,324 --> 01:16:22,205
Nope.

1310
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:25,605
We did two things right.

1311
01:16:25,645 --> 01:16:28,004
There is something
that we have to tell you.

1312
01:16:28,044 --> 01:16:30,084
INGRID: Your father and I...

1313
01:16:30,124 --> 01:16:31,964
we're secret agents.

1314
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:34,043
We have something to tell you.

1315
01:16:35,764 --> 01:16:37,844
We're secret agents, too.

1316
01:16:51,563 --> 01:16:53,442
NEWSCASTER: Eight more
incidents witnessed today...

1317
01:16:53,483 --> 01:16:55,362
all in different countries...

1318
01:16:55,403 --> 01:16:57,162
of yet another group
of children...

1319
01:16:57,203 --> 01:16:59,202
who've done
some incredible good deeds.

1320
01:16:59,242 --> 01:17:01,242
It seems that a day
doesn't go by...

1321
01:17:01,282 --> 01:17:02,882
that another amazing child...

1322
01:17:02,922 --> 01:17:05,041
performs some outstanding
act of charity...

1323
01:17:05,081 --> 01:17:06,681
or community service.

1324
01:17:06,721 --> 01:17:08,281
Who are these children...

1325
01:17:08,322 --> 01:17:10,841
and why are they so good
at being good?

1326
01:17:14,961 --> 01:17:16,840
I gotta have
the business section.

1327
01:17:16,881 --> 01:17:18,721
I thought
you closed down your shop.

1328
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,760
Yeah, but I gotta keep tabs
on free enterprise.

1329
01:17:20,801 --> 01:17:23,240
CARMEN: Boys,
can we please stop fighting?

1330
01:17:27,119 --> 01:17:29,360
ANNOUNCER: Hey, kids,
it's time for...

1331
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,720
Floop's Fooglies!

1332
01:17:33,759 --> 01:17:35,480
Good morning, my children.

1333
01:17:35,519 --> 01:17:37,400
Today,
I'd like to introduce you...

1334
01:17:37,439 --> 01:17:39,639
to two new characters
on our show...

1335
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:42,039
Carmenita and Junito.

1336
01:17:43,519 --> 01:17:45,079
[Beeping tone]

1337
01:17:45,118 --> 01:17:47,318
Ah, Cortezes.

1338
01:17:47,358 --> 01:17:49,718
An emergency assignment
has come up in the Far East.

1339
01:17:49,758 --> 01:17:51,038
I need you on it right away.

1340
01:17:51,078 --> 01:17:52,438
Oh, sorry, Devlin.

1341
01:17:52,478 --> 01:17:54,798
We haven't talked about this
as a family yet, so...

1342
01:17:54,837 --> 01:17:57,037
GREGORIO: Whether we
come out of retirement...

1343
01:17:57,078 --> 01:18:00,197
or not is a decision
that is up to us...

1344
01:18:00,237 --> 01:18:02,637
and our kids.

1345
01:18:02,677 --> 01:18:05,477
Uh, Gregorio, Ingrid,
I wasn't talking to you.

1346
01:18:05,516 --> 01:18:07,157
Ey?

1347
01:18:07,197 --> 01:18:09,636
No, this assignment
is for Carmen and Juni.

1348
01:18:09,676 --> 01:18:10,916
They're the ones we need.

1349
01:18:10,957 --> 01:18:12,836
They're the two most amazing
field agents...

1350
01:18:12,876 --> 01:18:14,636
that this organization's
ever seen.

1351
01:18:14,716 --> 01:18:16,436
So what do you say, kids?

1352
01:18:16,516 --> 01:18:18,275
You up for it?

1353
01:18:18,316 --> 01:18:19,716
Devlin,
if you want the Cortezes...

1354
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:21,956
you take all the Cortezes...

1355
01:18:21,995 --> 01:18:24,956
even Mom and Dad.

1356
01:18:24,995 --> 01:18:28,675
From now on, whatever we do,
we do together.

1357
01:18:30,955 --> 01:18:32,915
Spy work...that's easy.

1358
01:18:32,954 --> 01:18:35,355
Keeping a family together...

1359
01:18:35,355 --> 01:18:37,394
that's difficult.

1360
01:18:37,435 --> 01:18:40,834
And that's the mission
worth fighting for.

1361
01:18:40,835 --> 01:20:41,835
subs by tarun

1362
01:20:55,064 --> 01:20:57,904
FONDA: Stay close,
I know that you're with me

1363
01:20:57,904 --> 01:21:00,784
Get down and stay out of sight

1364
01:21:00,784 --> 01:21:02,863
So quick, move like a flash

1365
01:21:02,903 --> 01:21:06,263
Then we're gone, you're safe

1366
01:21:06,303 --> 01:21:08,983
Spy Kids

1367
01:21:09,023 --> 01:21:11,942
Are gonna save the world

1368
01:21:12,023 --> 01:21:14,623
Fly high

1369
01:21:14,702 --> 01:21:17,663
It's time to save the world

1370
01:21:21,142 --> 01:21:23,662
Look out, always in danger

1371
01:21:23,701 --> 01:21:26,702
Move fast,
everything's all right

1372
01:21:26,741 --> 01:21:29,261
Wake up,
nothing is stranger than

1373
01:21:29,302 --> 01:21:32,181
What you'll find

1374
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:34,781
Spy Kids

1375
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:37,941
Are gonna save the world

1376
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:40,500
Fly high

1377
01:21:40,541 --> 01:21:43,660
It's time to save the world

1378
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:45,940
Little spies

1379
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:48,860
Have a big surprise

1380
01:21:48,939 --> 01:21:51,459
And make no mistake

1381
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:53,379
Because we're in charge

1382
01:21:53,420 --> 01:21:55,100
You'd better watch out

1383
01:22:12,898 --> 01:22:15,618
Look out, always in danger

1384
01:22:15,658 --> 01:22:18,617
Look out, always in danger

1385
01:22:18,698 --> 01:22:19,937
- Look out
- Spy Kids

1386
01:22:19,977 --> 01:22:21,217
Always in danger

1387
01:22:21,257 --> 01:22:23,777
Love it

1388
01:22:23,817 --> 01:22:26,497
Spy Kids

1389
01:22:26,537 --> 01:22:28,617
Are gonna save the world

1390
01:22:28,657 --> 01:22:30,057
Go, go, go, go

1391
01:22:43,616 --> 01:22:45,175
FLOOP:
It's a cruel, cruel world

1392
01:22:45,215 --> 01:22:46,815
All you little boys and girls

1393
01:22:46,855 --> 01:22:48,576
And some mean, nasty people

1394
01:22:48,615 --> 01:22:50,535
Want to have you
for their supper

1395
01:22:50,615 --> 01:22:53,895
But if you follow me,
you can all be free

1396
01:22:53,935 --> 01:22:56,014
Free, you can all be free

1397
01:22:56,054 --> 01:22:58,254
As a bird on a big TV

1398
01:22:58,295 --> 01:23:01,215
If you dream, if you dream,
if you dream

1399
01:23:01,254 --> 01:23:03,054
My dream

1400
01:23:03,094 --> 01:23:04,734
It's a cold, cruel world
for the nasty boys and girls

1401
01:23:04,774 --> 01:23:06,374
And the selfish,
mean, nasty people

1402
01:23:06,414 --> 01:23:07,973
Nasty, nasty, nasty, nasty

1403
01:23:08,014 --> 01:23:10,814
But there's a way
you can make your day

1404
01:23:10,853 --> 01:23:12,454
You can laugh, you can smile

1405
01:23:12,493 --> 01:23:13,933
You can come and stay a while

1406
01:23:13,973 --> 01:23:15,334
You can dream my dream

1407
01:23:15,373 --> 01:23:16,933
You can have it all with me

1408
01:23:16,973 --> 01:23:19,973
You can dream my dream,
you can dream my dream

1409
01:23:20,053 --> 01:23:21,453
You can dream

1410
01:23:21,493 --> 01:23:22,892
My Dream
