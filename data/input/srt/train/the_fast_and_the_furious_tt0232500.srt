1
00:01:00,275 --> 00:01:03,574
Just packed up a real money load, and it's coming your way.

2
00:01:03,645 --> 00:01:05,909
Look for "Rodgers" on the side of the truck.

3
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:08,415
Don't forget my share of the deal.

4
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,220
Shit!

5
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:58,652
Shit!

6
00:04:38,961 --> 00:04:43,022
- Tuna on white, no crust, right? - I don't know. How is it?

7
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:46,158
Every day for the last three weeks you've been coming in here...

8
00:04:46,235 --> 00:04:48,465
and you've been asking me how the tuna is.

9
00:04:48,537 --> 00:04:50,027
It was crappy yesterday...

10
00:04:50,105 --> 00:04:54,132
it was crappy the day before, and guess what.

11
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:56,200
- It hasn't changed. - I'll have the tuna.

12
00:04:56,278 --> 00:04:58,371
- No crust? - No crust.

13
00:05:22,671 --> 00:05:23,603
Thank you.

14
00:06:10,585 --> 00:06:13,019
Talk to me, Jesse. This ain't working, brother.

15
00:06:13,088 --> 00:06:16,455
It's your fuel map. It's got a nasty hole.

16
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:19,119
- It's why you're unloading in third. - I told you it was third.

17
00:06:19,194 --> 00:06:22,027
I lengthen the injector pulse another millisec...

18
00:06:22,097 --> 00:06:25,032
and just tune the NOS timer, you'll run nines.

19
00:06:32,441 --> 00:06:34,841
What's up with this fool? What is he, sandwich crazy?

20
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,844
No, V. He ain't here for the food.

21
00:06:36,912 --> 00:06:39,540
Chill out, bro. He's just slingin parts for Harry.

22
00:06:39,614 --> 00:06:42,981
- I know what he's slinging. - He's trying to get in Mia's pants.

23
00:06:43,051 --> 00:06:45,485
- What's up, guys? - How you doing, Mia?

24
00:06:45,554 --> 00:06:46,987
How you living, girl?

25
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,918
Hey, Dom. You want something to drink?

26
00:07:01,903 --> 00:07:03,734
Ah, he's beautiful.

27
00:07:03,805 --> 00:07:05,397
I like his haircut.

28
00:07:06,108 --> 00:07:07,405
Vince.

29
00:07:07,476 --> 00:07:08,272
Vince!

30
00:07:09,945 --> 00:07:11,936
- What? - Can I get you anything?

31
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:15,683
You look good.

32
00:07:19,054 --> 00:07:21,318
Thanks a lot, Mia. See you tomorrow.

33
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,823
Sure.

34
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:27,760
- Tomorrow? - Oh, I love this part.

35
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:33,556
Try Fatburger from now on.

36
00:07:33,632 --> 00:07:36,066
You can get yourself a double-cheese with fries for 2.95, faggot.

37
00:07:36,135 --> 00:07:39,263
- I like the tuna here. - Bullshit. No one likes the tuna.

38
00:07:39,338 --> 00:07:40,896
Well, I do.

39
00:07:53,552 --> 00:07:55,918
Jesus Christ, Dom! Would you get out there?

40
00:07:55,988 --> 00:07:58,616
I'm sick of this shit! I'm not kidding, Dom!

41
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,453
Get out there!

42
00:08:03,495 --> 00:08:06,396
- What'd you put in that sandwich? - That's really funny.

43
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:09,222
All right.

44
00:08:27,653 --> 00:08:30,383
- He was in my face. - I'm in your face.

45
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,955
Relax! Don't push it! You embarrass me!

46
00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:39,763
Get over there!

47
00:08:39,832 --> 00:08:41,993
Jesse, give me the wallet.

48
00:08:44,837 --> 00:08:48,295
"Brian Earl Spilner." Sounds like a serial killer name.

49
00:08:48,373 --> 00:08:50,034
- Is that what you are? - No, man.

50
00:08:50,108 --> 00:08:52,941
Don't come around here again.

51
00:08:54,546 --> 00:08:57,344
Hey, man, you know this is bullshit.

52
00:08:57,416 --> 00:09:00,476
- You work for Harry, right? - Yeah, I just started.

53
00:09:00,552 --> 00:09:02,383
You were just fired.

54
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,192
Hey, Dominic, I appreciate what you did in a big way.

55
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,534
Dominic, I owe you.

56
00:09:22,307 --> 00:09:25,140
Brian, you're messing with my business.

57
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,144
When Dominic drives, he's golden.

58
00:09:27,212 --> 00:09:30,443
Kids pour in here, want everything he has, every performance part...

59
00:09:30,515 --> 00:09:32,142
and they pay cash!

60
00:09:32,217 --> 00:09:35,152
- What did Dominic say? - You don't wanna know.

61
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,621
- What did Dominic say? - He wants you outta here.

62
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,715
- He wants me outta here? - Yes!

63
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:44,489
- And what did you say to Dom? - What do you think I said?

64
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:47,430
I told him, "Good help is hard to find."

65
00:09:50,035 --> 00:09:51,468
Relax.

66
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:56,507
I need NOS.

67
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:58,770
- I need NOS. - No.

68
00:09:58,844 --> 00:10:01,540
My car topped out at 140 miles per hour this morning.

69
00:10:01,613 --> 00:10:03,547
Amateurs don't use nitrous oxide.

70
00:10:03,615 --> 00:10:06,880
I've seen the way you drive. You got a heavy foot.

71
00:10:06,952 --> 00:10:09,716
- You'll blow yourself to pieces. - I need one of these.

72
00:10:09,788 --> 00:10:11,756
One of the big ones.

73
00:10:11,823 --> 00:10:14,155
Actually, no. Let's make it two.

74
00:10:14,226 --> 00:10:16,762
And, Harry, I need it by tonight.

75
00:10:16,762 --> 00:10:17,160
And, Harry, I need it by tonight.

76
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:31,096
Hey, hold up, hold up. Look at this snowman right here, man.

77
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:39,106
Sweet ride. What you running under there, man?

78
00:11:41,346 --> 00:11:44,179
- Making me find out the hard way? - Hell, yeah.

79
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:47,810
You brave. You brave. They call me Hector.

80
00:11:47,886 --> 00:11:50,377
I got a last name too, but I can't pronounce it, so...

81
00:11:50,455 --> 00:11:51,945
Brian Spilner.

82
00:11:52,024 --> 00:11:54,618
Typical white boy name. Know what I'm saying?

83
00:11:57,029 --> 00:11:58,826
See that over there?

84
00:11:58,897 --> 00:12:02,697
That's mine. It's my baby. But I ain't cutting her loose tonight.

85
00:12:02,768 --> 00:12:04,827
- Why not? - 'Cause I'm going legit.

86
00:12:04,903 --> 00:12:07,371
Trying to get on the NI RA circuit. You heard about that?

87
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:08,872
Hell, yeah.

88
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,034
- So what's up with you, man? - I'm just waiting for Toretto.

89
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,544
Shit. Better get in line.

90
00:12:14,613 --> 00:12:17,707
- This yours? - Yeah. I'm standing next to it.

91
00:12:17,783 --> 00:12:21,685
That's funny. You know, Edwin happens to know a few things.

92
00:12:21,753 --> 00:12:23,846
And one of the things Edwin knows is...

93
00:12:23,922 --> 00:12:26,390
it's not how you stand by your car.

94
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,926
It's how you race your car. You better learn that.

95
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,760
Oh, shit. Here they come. It's on.

96
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:58,689
- Dom, how you doing? - Hey, Camille.

97
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:00,691
You been doing yoga?

98
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:07,755
You did? Of course you did. Monica.

99
00:13:10,469 --> 00:13:12,767
I smell skanks.

100
00:13:12,838 --> 00:13:17,036
Why don't you pack it up before I leave tread marks on your face?

101
00:13:18,643 --> 00:13:20,907
- Letty, I was just talking. - Whatever.

102
00:13:20,979 --> 00:13:23,106
Okay, Hector.

103
00:13:23,181 --> 00:13:25,376
Yeah? What's up, man?

104
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:27,943
- What's up? - Edwin.

105
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:30,647
- How we doing this tonight? - One race.

106
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:33,418
Two-G buy-in. Winner takes all.

107
00:13:33,492 --> 00:13:36,393
- Hector, you're gonna hold the cash. - Why Hector?

108
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:38,452
He's too slow to make away with the money.

109
00:13:41,099 --> 00:13:44,125
- Good luck, guys. - Wait. Hold up.

110
00:13:44,202 --> 00:13:48,104
I don't have any cash, but I do have the pink slip to my car.

111
00:13:48,173 --> 00:13:51,802
You just can't climb in the ring with Ali 'cause you think you box.

112
00:13:51,877 --> 00:13:54,778
He knows I can box.

113
00:13:54,846 --> 00:13:56,939
So check it out. It's like this.

114
00:13:57,015 --> 00:14:00,178
I lose, the winner takes my car, clean and clear.

115
00:14:00,252 --> 00:14:04,018
But if I win, I take the cash, and I take the respect.

116
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:05,420
Respect.

117
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,327
To some people, that's more important.

118
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,820
That your car?

119
00:14:17,002 --> 00:14:19,368
I see a cool-air intake.

120
00:14:19,437 --> 00:14:22,167
It's got a NOS-fogger system and a T-four turbo, Dominic.

121
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,367
I see an AIC controller.

122
00:14:24,442 --> 00:14:27,309
It has direct port nitrous injection.

123
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:30,343
Yeah, and a stand-alone fuel management system.

124
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:34,668
Not a bad way to spend $10,000.

125
00:14:36,382 --> 00:14:38,612
You see that shit?

126
00:14:38,684 --> 00:14:41,847
He's got enough NOS in there to blow himself up, period.

127
00:14:42,822 --> 00:14:44,813
What do you say? Am I won'thy?

128
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,688
We don't know yet. But you're in.

129
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,352
Let's go.

130
00:15:55,294 --> 00:15:57,228
What the hell's going on around here?

131
00:15:57,296 --> 00:16:01,232
Street's closed, pizza boy. Find another way home.

132
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,892
Goddamn street racers.

133
00:16:02,968 --> 00:16:05,903
Iog on 22, code three. Tension is high.

134
00:16:05,971 --> 00:16:07,905
They've blocked the street.

135
00:16:53,652 --> 00:16:55,085
Edwin...

136
00:16:56,856 --> 00:17:00,314
this is yours, whether you win or lose.

137
00:17:00,392 --> 00:17:03,520
But if you win, you get her too.

138
00:17:12,738 --> 00:17:14,330
You're gonna win.

139
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:17,333
I'm gonna win.

140
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,655
We had a reported homicide, 187, at Barakian liquor.

141
00:18:04,723 --> 00:18:07,783
I've got a 187 in Glendale. Cops are all over it.

142
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,328
We're good to roll. I repeat, good to roll.

143
00:18:10,396 --> 00:18:12,330
- Let's race! - Right.

144
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,264
Go!

145
00:18:36,355 --> 00:18:37,788
Hell, yeah!

146
00:18:53,973 --> 00:18:56,305
Damn, that guy's fast.

147
00:19:03,515 --> 00:19:06,609
Let's go! "Menage a"!

148
00:19:33,045 --> 00:19:36,105
No! Monica!

149
00:19:51,263 --> 00:19:53,163
Shut up!

150
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:49,883
Let's go now, baby!

151
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,326
- Here's what you want, right here. - There you go.

152
00:21:04,403 --> 00:21:06,564
You were racer a bunch of skateboards.

153
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:11,575
My sister holds the money.

154
00:21:11,643 --> 00:21:13,076
Count it.

155
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,010
And you're my trophy.

156
00:21:19,818 --> 00:21:21,809
Hey, Monica! What's up, baby?

157
00:21:21,887 --> 00:21:24,321
What's your problem, nigga? You didn't win.

158
00:21:26,658 --> 00:21:28,250
Fuck you, then!

159
00:21:41,237 --> 00:21:44,866
- Was that fun? - Got a problem there, huh, buddy?

160
00:21:51,481 --> 00:21:54,609
- What are you smiling about? - Dude, I almost had you.

161
00:21:57,387 --> 00:21:59,218
You almost had me?

162
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:02,884
You never had me. You never had your car.

163
00:22:05,228 --> 00:22:08,925
Granny shifting, not double-clutching like you should.

164
00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:13,435
You're lucky that hundred-shot of NOS didn't blow the welds on the intake.

165
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:16,972
Almost had me?

166
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,979
Now me and the mad scientist gotta rip apart the block...

167
00:22:24,047 --> 00:22:26,880
and replace the piston rings you fried.

168
00:22:34,491 --> 00:22:36,618
Ask any racer, any real racer.

169
00:22:36,693 --> 00:22:40,151
It don't matter if you win by an inch or a mile.

170
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,027
Winning's winning.

171
00:22:49,172 --> 00:22:52,005
Available units, we have reported street racing along Hawthorne...

172
00:22:52,075 --> 00:22:54,339
Oh, shit! We got cops!

173
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,672
Go!

174
00:23:07,223 --> 00:23:10,283
Dom, get in the car! Go!

175
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,934
Toretto, stop right there!

176
00:24:52,962 --> 00:24:54,793
Get in!

177
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:44,108
You're the last person in the world I expected to show up.

178
00:25:45,682 --> 00:25:49,049
I thought if I got in your good graces, you might let me keep my car.

179
00:25:49,118 --> 00:25:52,713
You are in my good graces, but you ain't keeper your car.

180
00:25:54,123 --> 00:25:56,785
You drive like you've done this before. What are you, a wheel man?

181
00:25:58,761 --> 00:26:00,695
You boost cars?

182
00:26:01,964 --> 00:26:04,159
- No. Never. - Ever done time?

183
00:26:04,233 --> 00:26:07,464
Couple of overnighters. No big deal.

184
00:26:07,537 --> 00:26:10,836
What about the two years in juvie for boosting cars?

185
00:26:13,543 --> 00:26:15,773
Tucson, right?

186
00:26:15,845 --> 00:26:19,576
Yeah, I had Jesse run a profile on you, Brian Earl Spilner.

187
00:26:19,649 --> 00:26:23,881
He'll find anything on the Web, anything about anybody.

188
00:26:23,953 --> 00:26:25,887
So why bullshit?

189
00:26:27,423 --> 00:26:29,357
So what about you?

190
00:26:31,294 --> 00:26:33,524
Two years in Lompoc.

191
00:26:35,932 --> 00:26:37,923
I'll die before I go back.

192
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,334
- Oh, great. - What?

193
00:26:48,644 --> 00:26:51,272
It's gonna be a long-ass night, that's what.

194
00:26:55,318 --> 00:26:56,910
Follow us.

195
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,936
I thought we had an agreement.

196
00:27:50,006 --> 00:27:52,201
You stay away, I stay away.

197
00:27:53,276 --> 00:27:54,937
Everybody stays happy.

198
00:27:55,011 --> 00:27:57,104
We got lost, Johnny. What do you want me to tell you?

199
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:00,616
- Who's "we"? - My new mechanic.

200
00:28:00,683 --> 00:28:02,378
Brian, meet Johnny Tran.

201
00:28:02,451 --> 00:28:05,477
The guy in the snakeskin pants, that's his cousin, Lance.

202
00:28:05,555 --> 00:28:09,184
So when are you gonna give me a shot at that Honda 2000 of yours?

203
00:28:09,258 --> 00:28:11,954
- This your ride? - It was. It's his now.

204
00:28:12,028 --> 00:28:14,121
No, it's not. I haven't taken delivery.

205
00:28:16,966 --> 00:28:19,332
Then it's nobody's car.

206
00:28:19,402 --> 00:28:21,802
Somebody put in the wrench time.

207
00:28:23,673 --> 00:28:27,769
- What do you think, Lance? - It's an amazing machine.

208
00:28:27,844 --> 00:28:29,607
Yes, indeed.

209
00:28:31,581 --> 00:28:33,515
Let's go.

210
00:28:35,251 --> 00:28:37,811
I'll see you in the desert next month.

211
00:28:37,887 --> 00:28:39,854
Be ready to have your ass handed to you.

212
00:28:39,987 --> 00:28:41,784
You're gonna need more than that crotch rocket.

213
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,881
I got something for you.

214
00:28:57,738 --> 00:28:59,205
What the hell was that about?

215
00:28:59,273 --> 00:29:02,208
Long story. I'll tell you later. Let's get outta here.

216
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,503
NOS!

217
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:46,146
So, what the hell was that all about?

218
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,881
It's a long story.

219
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:50,014
We got a 20-mile hike. Humor me.

220
00:29:51,091 --> 00:29:53,821
A business deal that went sour.

221
00:29:53,894 --> 00:29:56,954
Plus, I made the mistake of sleeping with his sister.

222
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:30,758
Yo, Spilner.

223
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:33,766
You want a beer?

224
00:30:35,636 --> 00:30:37,228
Oh, shit.

225
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:04,323
We were all there, right? Falling behind.

226
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:06,832
- With all that nitrous. - Yeah.

227
00:31:13,574 --> 00:31:16,600
Yo, Dom. We were just about to go looking for you, brother.

228
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:25,641
- Where were you? - There were mass cops there.

229
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:28,517
They came in from every direction. Their shit was orchestrated.

230
00:31:28,589 --> 00:31:31,080
- This your beer? - Yeah, that's my beer.

231
00:31:34,128 --> 00:31:36,119
Yo, Einstein. Take it upstairs.

232
00:31:37,131 --> 00:31:39,292
You can't detail a car with the cover on.

233
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,291
Can't even get that right.

234
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:43,802
You all right?

235
00:31:45,672 --> 00:31:47,299
Am I all right?

236
00:31:47,374 --> 00:31:49,365
It was just a question.

237
00:31:52,112 --> 00:31:55,275
Yo, Dom! Why'd you bring the buster here?

238
00:31:55,349 --> 00:31:57,340
'Cause the buster kept me out of handcuffs!

239
00:31:57,418 --> 00:32:00,182
He didn't just run back to the fort!

240
00:32:00,254 --> 00:32:02,722
The buster brought me back.

241
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:12,164
You can have any brew you want... as long as it's a Corona.

242
00:32:12,232 --> 00:32:15,258
- Thanks, man. - That's Vince's, so enjoy it.

243
00:32:16,737 --> 00:32:17,704
You...

244
00:32:25,245 --> 00:32:27,179
Hey, bro, you got a bathroom?

245
00:32:27,247 --> 00:32:29,875
Yeah, upstairs. First door on the right.

246
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:47,233
He's got no call being up in here.

247
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:50,031
- You don't know that fool for shit! - He's right, Dom.

248
00:32:50,104 --> 00:32:52,800
Vince, there was a time when I didn't know you.

249
00:32:52,873 --> 00:32:55,364
That was in the third grade!

250
00:32:57,811 --> 00:32:59,972
Yeah, so, what girls are here?

251
00:33:00,047 --> 00:33:02,880
- You name it. You want mine? - You need to shut the f...

252
00:33:04,184 --> 00:33:06,812
- You don't have anything? - You look a bit tinged.

253
00:33:06,887 --> 00:33:08,946
I think you should go upstairs and give me a massage.

254
00:33:09,022 --> 00:33:10,614
Look at all our guests.

255
00:33:10,691 --> 00:33:13,956
How about we go upstairs and you give me a massage?

256
00:33:16,563 --> 00:33:17,996
Crazy lady.

257
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:28,474
You know you owe me a ten-second car, right?

258
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,143
Ouch.

259
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:34,542
Oh, shit.

260
00:33:39,186 --> 00:33:41,154
Did you wipe the seat?

261
00:33:44,725 --> 00:33:47,489
Oh, Jesus Christ! Would you cut the shit already?

262
00:33:47,561 --> 00:33:48,994
Come on!

263
00:33:50,464 --> 00:33:53,126
Come on. Let's go get me a drink.

264
00:33:53,267 --> 00:33:56,202
Come on, man. We were just about to get along.

265
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:05,876
- So, what do you want? - Anything, long as it's cold.

266
00:34:07,114 --> 00:34:10,106
My brother likes you. He usually doesn't like anybody.

267
00:34:10,184 --> 00:34:12,744
Yeah, he's a complicated guy.

268
00:34:12,819 --> 00:34:14,753
Yeah? What about you?

269
00:34:17,324 --> 00:34:20,225
- I'm simpler. - You're a shitty liar.

270
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:23,829
Well, I'll take that as a compliment.

271
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:28,061
- But there's a problem. - What's that?

272
00:34:28,135 --> 00:34:30,865
You need to get some sleep.

273
00:34:30,938 --> 00:34:35,307
And you definitely, definitely need a shower.

274
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:38,105
Come on. I'll take you home.

275
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:03,266
Show me your hands. Very good. Now open the door.

276
00:35:03,337 --> 00:35:06,932
Put your hands on your head. Behind your head.

277
00:35:07,007 --> 00:35:10,704
Face the front of the vehicle, walk backwards towards the rear.

278
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:13,905
Take two steps to your right. Stop right there.

279
00:35:17,184 --> 00:35:18,617
What'd I do?

280
00:35:18,685 --> 00:35:21,620
Shut up. He's clean, Sarge.

281
00:35:31,932 --> 00:35:34,560
Damn! Muse, will you take these things off?

282
00:35:34,635 --> 00:35:37,160
- Shit. You put 'em on so tight. - I like realism.

283
00:35:37,237 --> 00:35:40,104
- You like realism. - You never know who's watching.

284
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:48,400
Nice crib, Sergeant. It's a lot nicer than that last place you confiscated.

285
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:52,711
Ain't it? Eddie Fisher built this house for Elizabeth Taylor in the '50s.

286
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:55,411
See? Even the cops are Hollywood in Hollywood.

287
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,457
Here he is, fresh from Toretto's hot rod heaven.

288
00:36:02,526 --> 00:36:04,460
That was an $80,000 vehicle, officer.

289
00:36:04,528 --> 00:36:08,123
- Wait. You tell him what happened? - He knows what happened.

290
00:36:08,198 --> 00:36:11,565
- Send the bill to Johnny Tran. - The kid's giving me attitude?

291
00:36:11,635 --> 00:36:14,832
That doesn't speak very well for police-FBI relations, Tanner.

292
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:17,999
- I walk in, the guy's already giving... - All right, all right.

293
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:20,305
We'll talk, okay? Let's talk about it.

294
00:36:20,377 --> 00:36:23,676
Muse, why don't you make us four iced cappuccinos, please.

295
00:36:23,747 --> 00:36:26,443
- Come on. - Regular or decaf, Sarge?

296
00:36:27,951 --> 00:36:30,112
Decaf, I think.

297
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:33,088
Four hijackings in two months, and we don't have anything.

298
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:35,591
DVD players and digital cameras alone are worth a million-two...

299
00:36:35,659 --> 00:36:38,287
which brings the grand total to six million plus.

300
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,490
We're in the political crosshairs now, Brian.

301
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:43,692
That's why you're undercover.

302
00:36:43,767 --> 00:36:47,669
You want that detective badge fast, kid. And you wanna know something?

303
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:51,105
The FBI can help, if you come through for us.

304
00:36:52,242 --> 00:36:55,268
- What does the truck driver say? - He gave us the same M.O.

305
00:36:55,345 --> 00:36:57,540
Three Honda Civics, precision driving...

306
00:36:57,614 --> 00:37:00,777
the same green neon glow from under the chassis.

307
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:03,445
Lab says the skid marks came back the same:

308
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,454
Mashamoto ZX tires.

309
00:37:05,522 --> 00:37:08,013
So we know that it's somebody in the street racing world.

310
00:37:08,091 --> 00:37:10,150
We don't make this case soon...

311
00:37:10,227 --> 00:37:12,627
the truckers will take matters into their own hands.

312
00:37:12,696 --> 00:37:15,324
I tell 'em we're close.

313
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,333
You gonna make me a liar?

314
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,335
Look, what do we know?

315
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:22,065
We all know this world revolves around Toretto, right?

316
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:25,074
I'm not saying that he's necessarily the one that's popping these trucks...

317
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:27,872
but I can guarantee the both of you that he knows who is.

318
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:30,243
- It's just a matter of time until... - You want time?

319
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:33,841
Buy the magazine. We don't have time.

320
00:37:35,118 --> 00:37:37,313
Just get me something I can use.

321
00:37:38,488 --> 00:37:40,513
Is Harry cooperating?

322
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:44,425
Yeah, like a guy who's gonna do time for receiving stolen property if he doesn't.

323
00:37:44,494 --> 00:37:46,485
What kind of vibe is he getting from Toretto?

324
00:37:46,563 --> 00:37:49,623
He's scared of him, but he doesn't think he's jacking trucks in his spare time.

325
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,134
- He's too controlled for that. - Wait.

326
00:37:52,202 --> 00:37:55,399
Not that I want to contradict Harry's fine judge of character...

327
00:37:55,472 --> 00:37:59,272
but Toretto did hard time for nearly beating a guy to death.

328
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:02,107
He's got nitrous oxide in his blood and a gas tank for a brain.

329
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,113
Do not turn your back on him.

330
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:06,416
Hey, Tanner. I'm gonna need another car.

331
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:07,383
Hey, Tanner. I'm gonna need another car.

332
00:38:11,655 --> 00:38:13,088
What about parts and service?

333
00:38:13,156 --> 00:38:15,249
- Hold off on that. - What should I do with this?

334
00:38:19,863 --> 00:38:22,229
All right, what the hell is this?

335
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:24,233
What do you got there?

336
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:27,736
- This is your car. - My car?

337
00:38:27,804 --> 00:38:31,262
I said a ten-second car, not a ten-minute car.

338
00:38:31,341 --> 00:38:35,402
You could push this across the finish line, or tow it.

339
00:38:36,713 --> 00:38:38,908
Couldn't even tow that across the finish line.

340
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,442
No faith.

341
00:38:41,518 --> 00:38:44,112
I have faith in you, but this isn't a junkyard.

342
00:38:44,187 --> 00:38:46,417
- This is a garage. - Pop the hood.

343
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,253
- Pop the hood? - Pop the hood.

344
00:38:50,894 --> 00:38:52,327
TwoJZ engine.

345
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:55,092
- No shit. - And what did I tell you?

346
00:38:55,165 --> 00:38:57,497
- I retract my previous statement. - You know what?

347
00:38:57,567 --> 00:39:02,197
This will decimate all after you put about 15 grand in it...

348
00:39:02,272 --> 00:39:05,673
or more, if we have to overnight parts from Japan.

349
00:39:05,742 --> 00:39:08,040
We'll put it on my tab at Harry's.

350
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:09,544
Yes!

351
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:13,777
I gotta get you racing again so I can make some money off your ass.

352
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:17,843
There's a show in the desert called Race Wars, and that's where you'll do it.

353
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:22,654
Tell you what. When you're not working at Harry's, you're working here.

354
00:39:22,726 --> 00:39:26,924
If you can't find the right tool in this garage, Mr. Arizona...

355
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:27,998
you don't belong near a car.

356
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:29,192
You don't belong near a car.

357
00:39:33,103 --> 00:39:35,037
He owns you now.

358
00:39:59,763 --> 00:40:01,861
Tell me what you think about this.

359
00:40:01,994 --> 00:40:04,189
Koni adjustables.

360
00:40:04,263 --> 00:40:06,493
Gonna save us about two pounds.

361
00:40:06,565 --> 00:40:09,966
And they're gonna give us better traction for the hole shot.

362
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:11,730
All right?

363
00:40:11,804 --> 00:40:14,204
This is your basic layout of the car...

364
00:40:14,273 --> 00:40:18,801
and that's pretty much what it could look like when it's finished.

365
00:40:18,878 --> 00:40:20,812
Red, green.

366
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,007
Man, you should be going to MIT or something.

367
00:40:23,082 --> 00:40:25,016
Yeah, right.

368
00:40:25,084 --> 00:40:27,985
No, I got that... Oh, what's it called?

369
00:40:29,054 --> 00:40:32,217
- That attention disorder... - ADD?

370
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:34,987
Yes, that shit. Yeah.

371
00:40:36,195 --> 00:40:39,028
You know, I was good in algebra and, like, math...

372
00:40:39,098 --> 00:40:40,759
and shit.

373
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:42,824
Everything else I failed.

374
00:40:42,902 --> 00:40:45,769
Dropped out of school. I don't know.

375
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:48,966
It's just something about engines...

376
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:52,841
that calms me down, you know?

377
00:41:12,598 --> 00:41:15,590
- I'm outta here. - Come on, dog.

378
00:41:15,668 --> 00:41:18,364
Vince, get over here and give us a hand.

379
00:41:18,437 --> 00:41:20,769
Looks like you got all the help you need, brother.

380
00:41:35,354 --> 00:41:37,413
- Mia! - All right already.

381
00:41:37,489 --> 00:41:39,923
- The chickers dry. - I'm coming out already.

382
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:48,598
Hey, hold up.

383
00:41:48,667 --> 00:41:51,830
Because you were the first out of everybody here...

384
00:41:51,904 --> 00:41:54,771
to reach in to get the chicken, you say grace.

385
00:42:00,312 --> 00:42:02,280
Dear heavenly, uh...

386
00:42:02,348 --> 00:42:03,781
Spirit.

387
00:42:03,849 --> 00:42:05,783
Spirit. Thank you.

388
00:42:05,851 --> 00:42:09,947
Uh, thank you for providing us with a direct port...

389
00:42:10,022 --> 00:42:11,956
nitrous, uh, injection...

390
00:42:12,024 --> 00:42:16,984
four core intercoolers and ball-bearing turbos...

391
00:42:17,062 --> 00:42:20,190
and, um, titanium valve springs.

392
00:42:20,265 --> 00:42:22,130
- Thank you. - Amen.

393
00:42:22,201 --> 00:42:24,761
- Not bad. - Amen.

394
00:42:24,837 --> 00:42:28,102
He was praying to the car gods, man.

395
00:42:29,108 --> 00:42:31,440
- These are the best. - What do you want?

396
00:42:32,244 --> 00:42:33,802
- Practice. - Thank you, girl.

397
00:42:33,879 --> 00:42:35,506
Look who it is.

398
00:42:35,581 --> 00:42:37,344
Old Coyotes 'R' Us.

399
00:42:37,416 --> 00:42:39,543
I thought you weren't hungry, pumpkin.

400
00:42:40,686 --> 00:42:42,984
- You know, I gotta eat. - He's always hungry.

401
00:42:43,055 --> 00:42:44,818
All right, sit down.

402
00:42:52,798 --> 00:42:54,732
How you doing, Mia?

403
00:43:06,612 --> 00:43:08,671
- Jesse, hand me that chicken. - Let's eat some grub.

404
00:43:08,747 --> 00:43:12,717
- Want some of that chicken? - Did you rent a movie or something?

405
00:43:19,457 --> 00:43:20,890
Need a hand?

406
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:24,860
No, I'm good. You can go join the boys watching the movie.

407
00:43:24,929 --> 00:43:27,363
Well, the cook doesn't clean where I come from.

408
00:43:27,431 --> 00:43:28,898
I'd like to go there.

409
00:43:33,671 --> 00:43:35,605
I think we should go out sometime.

410
00:43:35,673 --> 00:43:37,868
No, I don't date my brother's friends.

411
00:43:38,976 --> 00:43:40,534
That sucks.

412
00:43:40,611 --> 00:43:43,603
- I guess I'll have to kick his ass then. - I'd love to see that one.

413
00:43:43,681 --> 00:43:47,447
No, I would... I would pay to see that one, actually.

414
00:44:00,931 --> 00:44:02,865
Wash my car when you get done.

415
00:44:02,933 --> 00:44:05,197
- What was that? - No, Mia.

416
00:44:05,269 --> 00:44:07,760
I'm talking to the punk.

417
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:10,272
And wear your favorite dress, 'cause when you're done...

418
00:44:10,341 --> 00:44:13,139
I'm putting you on the street where you belong, cutie.

419
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,305
Is this thing broken?

420
00:44:18,382 --> 00:44:20,407
What's wrong with this thing?

421
00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:25,646
V, what was that Cuban restaurant you wanted to take me to?

422
00:44:25,723 --> 00:44:27,816
The one with the peccadillo and the...

423
00:44:27,892 --> 00:44:31,123
- Red candles and the wooden table? - Yeah, the plantain too.

424
00:44:31,195 --> 00:44:33,720
- What was it called? - Cha Cha Cha.

425
00:44:33,798 --> 00:44:35,425
Yeah, that's it.

426
00:44:36,801 --> 00:44:38,826
Well, you can take me there.

427
00:44:38,903 --> 00:44:42,066
Friday night at 10:00. Is that good for you?

428
00:44:42,139 --> 00:44:45,472
- Yeah, it's perfect. - Good.

429
00:44:50,681 --> 00:44:54,617
- There's no popcorn? - Make your own goddamn popcorn!

430
00:45:08,566 --> 00:45:11,160
All right. Now that's valet parking.

431
00:45:15,172 --> 00:45:17,003
- Harry. - What's up, dog?

432
00:45:17,074 --> 00:45:19,304
Excellent, brother. Come on in, man.

433
00:45:19,376 --> 00:45:21,936
- Check it. It's yours. - What do we got here?

434
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:26,440
- Hinged some new help, huh? - Don't even think about it.

435
00:45:26,517 --> 00:45:28,576
- What's up, Hector? - How you feeling?

436
00:45:28,652 --> 00:45:31,052
Pretty good. What do you need?

437
00:45:31,121 --> 00:45:35,057
I need you to hook me up. Three of everything. I made a list.

438
00:45:36,861 --> 00:45:39,125
Why don't you look that over.

439
00:45:39,196 --> 00:45:41,721
- When do you need this stuff by? - Tomorrow. Today.

440
00:45:41,799 --> 00:45:43,232
- Now. - Right.

441
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,666
White boys work fast, don't they? Beto.

442
00:45:48,439 --> 00:45:50,168
That's right.

443
00:45:51,609 --> 00:45:54,305
You said you need three of all this?

444
00:45:54,378 --> 00:45:56,180
Yeah, three of everything. What do you think about that?

445
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:57,738
Yeah, three of everything. What do you think about that?

446
00:45:57,815 --> 00:46:00,147
Check this out.

447
00:48:07,242 --> 00:48:09,176
He moans like a cop.

448
00:48:18,086 --> 00:48:20,077
Brian, this is one of those times...

449
00:48:20,155 --> 00:48:22,680
when you need to be very clear about what you say.

450
00:48:22,757 --> 00:48:25,157
Nod if you understand me.

451
00:48:25,226 --> 00:48:26,853
Nod!

452
00:48:28,063 --> 00:48:29,724
Sit up.

453
00:48:36,104 --> 00:48:38,402
Tell me what the hell you're doing down here.

454
00:48:38,473 --> 00:48:41,601
Oh, shit. What I'm doing.

455
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:50,014
I owe... I owe you a ten-second car.

456
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:55,011
And what this is about, this is about Race Wars.

457
00:48:58,326 --> 00:49:02,626
I just went in there, and Hector is gonna be running...

458
00:49:02,697 --> 00:49:05,257
three Honda Civics with Spoon engines.

459
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:08,097
And on top of that, he just came into Harry's...

460
00:49:08,169 --> 00:49:11,798
and he ordered three T-66 turbos...

461
00:49:11,873 --> 00:49:16,105
with NOS, and a MoTeC system exhaust.

462
00:49:19,013 --> 00:49:20,947
So, what are you saying?

463
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:25,414
You're gonna go around and check everybody's shit out...

464
00:49:25,487 --> 00:49:27,455
one garage after another?

465
00:49:29,824 --> 00:49:30,756
Yeah.

466
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:36,687
Because Dom, you know...

467
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,699
I can't lose again.

468
00:49:40,135 --> 00:49:42,194
He's a cop.

469
00:49:43,471 --> 00:49:45,132
He's a cop!

470
00:49:48,476 --> 00:49:50,808
You a cop?

471
00:49:56,217 --> 00:49:58,276
Let's go for a little ride.

472
00:50:01,189 --> 00:50:02,622
Walk!

473
00:50:21,743 --> 00:50:23,677
All right, kid, stand watch.

474
00:50:57,745 --> 00:50:59,679
There's no engines.

475
00:51:00,748 --> 00:51:03,342
What are they planning on racer with? Hopes and dreams?

476
00:51:03,418 --> 00:51:05,784
I don't know, but I know they're sneaky as shit...

477
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:08,186
and they've got enough money to buy anything.

478
00:51:14,028 --> 00:51:14,960
What?

479
00:51:23,438 --> 00:51:25,497
Dom, we got a wolf pack.

480
00:51:25,573 --> 00:51:29,532
It's Johnny Tran, and he's coming your way really fast!

481
00:51:29,611 --> 00:51:31,238
All right, we got company.

482
00:51:31,312 --> 00:51:33,143
Spilner!

483
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,666
Come on. Move!

484
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:02,607
Let me ask you a question, Ted.

485
00:52:04,679 --> 00:52:07,273
Do you see anything wrong here?

486
00:52:11,886 --> 00:52:14,252
- We got no engines, do we? - No!

487
00:52:14,322 --> 00:52:16,085
- Do we? - No!

488
00:52:18,526 --> 00:52:22,758
Nissan SR-Twenty motors will pull a premium one week before Race Wars, huh?

489
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:24,593
Yeah, probably.

490
00:52:24,666 --> 00:52:28,102
You're a smart fence, Ted. Maybe too smart.

491
00:52:29,337 --> 00:52:31,271
What are you feeling, Lance?

492
00:52:32,674 --> 00:52:34,733
Forty weight?

493
00:52:34,809 --> 00:52:36,743
Fifty weight?

494
00:52:36,811 --> 00:52:38,745
A forty weight sounds nice.

495
00:52:54,362 --> 00:52:57,456
Where are they, Ted? Where are they?

496
00:52:57,532 --> 00:52:59,056
- Enough! - Where are they?

497
00:52:59,133 --> 00:53:01,158
They're in a warehouse.

498
00:53:01,235 --> 00:53:03,100
They're in a warehouse, man!

499
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:21,853
Kiss my shoes?

500
00:53:34,602 --> 00:53:37,469
Let's go get our engines.

501
00:53:37,538 --> 00:53:40,302
My superiors are flying in from D.C. Day after tomorrow.

502
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:43,071
I want something to show. Now, we have a top-echelon fence...

503
00:53:43,144 --> 00:53:45,578
with a lube hose in his mouth, automatic weapons...

504
00:53:45,646 --> 00:53:48,274
a jacket full of priors on every one of these Asian punks...

505
00:53:48,349 --> 00:53:51,648
a garage full of DVD players and generally psychotic behavior.

506
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:55,120
Why not move on Tran now, see where we are when the dust settles?

507
00:53:55,189 --> 00:53:58,215
Because all we have is behavior. Let me get some hard evidence...

508
00:53:58,292 --> 00:54:00,192
because what we have now is circumstantial...

509
00:54:00,261 --> 00:54:03,628
What we have is probable cause and truckers arming themselves...

510
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:06,030
for some good old vigilante mayhem.

511
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,036
Tell us about Hector.

512
00:54:08,169 --> 00:54:10,160
Latinos with spear guns. Give me a break.

513
00:54:10,238 --> 00:54:12,468
Hector's still working on the engines for the cars...

514
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,167
but the tinges don't match.

515
00:54:14,242 --> 00:54:15,834
Will someone just give me a cigarette?

516
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:18,208
- Get him a cigarette. - Don't get him a cigarette.

517
00:54:18,279 --> 00:54:19,837
- I thought you quit. - Yeah, I did quit.

518
00:54:19,914 --> 00:54:22,246
- Just give me a cigarette. - Get him a cigarette.

519
00:54:25,353 --> 00:54:29,790
- Tell me about Toretto. - He's too controlled for this.

520
00:54:29,857 --> 00:54:32,155
I mean, what? Going suicidal on semi trucks? No way.

521
00:54:32,226 --> 00:54:34,490
I mean, maybe his buddy Vince, but he's too stupid to pull it off.

522
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:37,827
I think the kid sister's blurring your vision.

523
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:39,423
- What do you say? - I don't blame you.

524
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,333
I'd get off on her surveillance photos too, buddy.

525
00:54:45,139 --> 00:54:49,132
Knock it off. What? Are you going native on me, Brian?

526
00:54:54,415 --> 00:54:57,043
Have you read Toretto's file lately?

527
00:54:57,118 --> 00:54:59,552
- Yeah. I memorized that file. - Yeah, well, read it again.

528
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:01,645
No. Better still. Take a look at these.

529
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:06,722
Remember I told you about the guy he nearly beat to death?

530
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:11,087
Toretto did this with a 3/4-inch torque wrench.

531
00:55:11,165 --> 00:55:14,396
He's a model of self-control.

532
00:55:16,504 --> 00:55:18,438
I need a few more days.

533
00:55:20,808 --> 00:55:21,776
I need a few more days.

534
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:22,743
I need a few more days.

535
00:55:28,015 --> 00:55:31,951
What it's gonna do is it's gonna spool up.

536
00:55:32,019 --> 00:55:34,214
I got this set up for 24 psi.

537
00:55:37,892 --> 00:55:39,757
You got big plans tonight?

538
00:55:41,996 --> 00:55:44,556
Yeah. We're going out to dinner.

539
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:47,464
You break her heart, I'll break your neck.

540
00:55:48,836 --> 00:55:51,361
That's not gonna happen.

541
00:55:55,543 --> 00:55:57,170
I wanna show you something.

542
00:56:07,488 --> 00:56:08,921
Wow.

543
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:13,083
Me and my dad built her.

544
00:56:14,095 --> 00:56:19,590
900 horses of Detroit muscle. It's a beast.

545
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:22,465
- Know what she ran in Palmdale? - No. What did she run?

546
00:56:22,537 --> 00:56:24,368
Nine seconds flat.

547
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:28,038
- God. - My dad was driving.

548
00:56:28,109 --> 00:56:32,546
So much torque the chassis twisted coming off the line.

549
00:56:33,648 --> 00:56:36,173
Barely kept her on the track.

550
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:39,219
- So what's your best time? - I've never driven her.

551
00:56:39,287 --> 00:56:40,379
Why not?

552
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,421
Scares the shit out of me.

553
00:56:47,562 --> 00:56:53,330
That's my dad. He was coming up in the pro stock car circuit.

554
00:56:53,401 --> 00:56:55,062
Last race of the season.

555
00:56:55,870 --> 00:57:01,206
A guy named Kenny Linder came up from inside in the final turn...

556
00:57:01,275 --> 00:57:04,574
and clipped his bumper and put him into the wall at 120.

557
00:57:07,915 --> 00:57:10,748
I watched my dad burn to death.

558
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:15,311
I remembered hearing him scream.

559
00:57:18,125 --> 00:57:22,755
The people that were there said he had died before the tanks blew.

560
00:57:29,036 --> 00:57:31,971
They said it was me who was screaming.

561
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:37,537
I saw Linder about a week later.

562
00:57:38,613 --> 00:57:42,413
I had a wrench, and I hit him.

563
00:57:42,483 --> 00:57:44,246
And I didn't intend to keep hitting him...

564
00:57:44,318 --> 00:57:47,617
but by the time I was done, I couldn't lift my arms.

565
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,994
He's a janitor at a high school.

566
00:57:56,063 --> 00:57:58,657
Has to take the bus to work every day.

567
00:57:59,734 --> 00:58:03,135
And they banned me from the tracks for life.

568
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:10,600
I live my life a quarter-mile at a time.

569
00:58:12,446 --> 00:58:15,176
Nothing else matters... not the mortgage, not the store...

570
00:58:15,249 --> 00:58:18,343
not my team and all that bullshit.

571
00:58:19,553 --> 00:58:22,078
For those ten seconds or less...

572
00:58:23,557 --> 00:58:24,990
I'm free.

573
00:58:45,546 --> 00:58:48,947
So how is it, anyways, that the gang came to be?

574
00:58:49,016 --> 00:58:50,244
- What? - The gang.

575
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:52,878
The gang? No, they don't call themselves a gang.

576
00:58:52,953 --> 00:58:55,114
- What do they call themselves? - They're a team.

577
00:58:55,189 --> 00:58:58,716
- They call themselves a team. - How is it the team came to be?

578
00:58:59,694 --> 00:59:01,855
Well, that's a whole lot of history.

579
00:59:03,097 --> 00:59:05,429
I've got time.

580
00:59:05,499 --> 00:59:07,763
Vince grew up with my brother.

581
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:11,032
He didn't ever actually grow up, as you can tell.

582
00:59:11,672 --> 00:59:15,904
But they were friends as kids. And Letty, she lived down the street.

583
00:59:15,976 --> 00:59:19,275
Always into cars, though, ever since she was ten years old.

584
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:23,477
So, naturally, my brother always had her attention.

585
00:59:23,551 --> 00:59:27,681
- And then she turned 16... - And then she had Dom's attention.

586
00:59:27,755 --> 00:59:31,418
Yeah. Yeah, it's funny how that works, isn't it?

587
00:59:31,492 --> 00:59:32,424
Yeah.

588
00:59:36,163 --> 00:59:38,256
How is it that Jesse fits into the whole thing?

589
00:59:39,467 --> 00:59:42,334
Well, Jesse and Leon just sort of showed up one night...

590
00:59:42,403 --> 00:59:44,098
and never ever left.

591
00:59:44,705 --> 00:59:47,538
It's just the way my brother is. Dom's like...

592
00:59:49,276 --> 00:59:51,210
He's like gravity.

593
00:59:52,346 --> 00:59:54,576
Everything just gets pulled to him.

594
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:57,911
Even you.

595
01:00:03,124 --> 01:00:05,888
The only thing that pulled me in was you.

596
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:08,292
Being friends with your brother is just a bonus.

597
01:00:11,665 --> 01:00:13,257
That's good.

598
01:00:15,136 --> 01:00:19,038
That's good. That's nice to come first every once in a while.

599
01:00:22,443 --> 01:00:23,933
You wanna go for a drive?

600
01:01:01,982 --> 01:01:04,177
- Yeah? - The hijackers have hit again.

601
01:01:04,251 --> 01:01:06,742
Bilkins made his decision. We're gonna move on Johnny Tran...

602
01:01:06,821 --> 01:01:11,349
and his guys at 1700 hours, unless you say otherwise.

603
01:01:11,425 --> 01:01:14,121
If you agree, just say yes.

604
01:01:14,195 --> 01:01:16,288
- Yeah. - Who is that?

605
01:01:18,032 --> 01:01:19,966
Just a wrong number.

606
01:04:12,132 --> 01:04:14,157
Yes, sir. Yeah, I know, but...

607
01:04:14,234 --> 01:04:16,930
Yeah, yeah. Yes. Yes, sir.

608
01:04:17,003 --> 01:04:18,994
Yeah. I got it.

609
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:25,244
The DVD players were purchased legally.

610
01:04:25,312 --> 01:04:28,440
All we've got on Tran and company are a couple of weapons charges...

611
01:04:28,515 --> 01:04:31,040
and some outstanding speeding tickets.

612
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:35,520
- So they're out. - Yeah. Father bailed 'em out.

613
01:04:35,589 --> 01:04:38,683
Is this the kind of intelligence I can expect from you, O'Conner?

614
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:47,158
- You're gonna put this on me? - I can put it on whoever I want to.

615
01:04:47,233 --> 01:04:50,464
- Perks of the job. - No way you're gonna put this on me.

616
01:04:50,537 --> 01:04:52,129
Wait a minute. Let me tell you.

617
01:04:52,205 --> 01:04:53,968
I don't care if you have to put a gun to someone's head...

618
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,474
and blow your cover to smithereens.

619
01:04:56,543 --> 01:04:59,034
You got 36 hours to crack this bastard...

620
01:04:59,112 --> 01:05:01,637
or you might wanna be thinking about another career.

621
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:16,784
It's Toretto, Brian. It always has been Toretto.

622
01:05:18,098 --> 01:05:21,898
Tran and Hector are... They're just fumes.

623
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:28,068
Well, I know you've been lying to me. My question is this:

624
01:05:28,141 --> 01:05:30,837
Have you been lying to yourself because you can't see past Mia?

625
01:05:34,514 --> 01:05:37,381
He won't go back to prison.

626
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:40,351
Well, that's a choice he's going to have to make.

627
01:05:44,491 --> 01:05:46,789
There's all kinds of family, Brian.

628
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:51,353
That's a choice you're gonna have to make.

629
01:06:09,115 --> 01:06:11,675
You ready for this, jumpy?

630
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:14,151
Yeah.

631
01:06:37,277 --> 01:06:40,508
Nice car. What's the retail on one of those?

632
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:44,016
More than you can afford, pal. Ferrari.

633
01:06:49,889 --> 01:06:50,821
Smoke 'em.

634
01:07:46,045 --> 01:07:50,539
- So what's wrong, Brian? - Nothing, man. I'm fine.

635
01:07:50,617 --> 01:07:54,451
Come on. Obviously something's off.

636
01:07:54,521 --> 01:07:58,651
Look. I have my good days, and I have my bad days, like anybody else.

637
01:07:59,259 --> 01:08:02,695
Brian, don't lose that cool. That's your meal ticket.

638
01:08:04,731 --> 01:08:07,666
My meal ticket? What? I can't pay for my own shrimp?

639
01:08:07,734 --> 01:08:11,192
- I got your shrimp. - That's one thing about me.

640
01:08:11,271 --> 01:08:14,104
You don't understand. I don't need handouts. I don't take handouts.

641
01:08:14,174 --> 01:08:15,971
I earn my way, every step.

642
01:08:17,076 --> 01:08:19,271
I just gotta make a little something extra on the side, like you.

643
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:21,540
What do you mean, like me?

644
01:08:21,614 --> 01:08:24,549
- What's that supposed to mean? - That's what I mean.

645
01:08:24,617 --> 01:08:27,552
- What does that mean, like me? - Don't try...

646
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:29,747
I'm not stupid, all right?

647
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:33,884
I know there's no way you paid for all that shit under the hood...

648
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:37,418
There's no way you paid for all that shit under the hood of those cars...

649
01:08:37,497 --> 01:08:39,829
by doing tune-ups and selling groceries.

650
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:43,762
Now, whatever it is you're in on, I want in on it too.

651
01:09:07,123 --> 01:09:09,648
- What is this? - Read it.

652
01:09:09,725 --> 01:09:12,285
- What is this for? - It's directions.

653
01:09:14,397 --> 01:09:18,231
To Race Wars. We'll see how you do.

654
01:09:19,468 --> 01:09:21,561
Then we'll talk.

655
01:10:07,216 --> 01:10:08,615
- How's it going, bro? - What's up, man?

656
01:10:08,684 --> 01:10:10,447
Welcome to Race Wars.

657
01:10:10,519 --> 01:10:12,783
Great. Thanks a lot.

658
01:10:34,777 --> 01:10:36,369
Baby. Hey, baby.

659
01:10:38,114 --> 01:10:41,572
You should watch from the side. I wouldn't want to get exhaust on you.

660
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:45,586
- Put your money where your mouth is? - How 'bout I race you for that ass?

661
01:10:46,288 --> 01:10:48,483
You want ass, why don't you hit Hollywood Boulevard?

662
01:10:48,557 --> 01:10:52,118
You want an adrenaline rush, it'll be two large.

663
01:10:52,194 --> 01:10:54,754
Right here, right now. What's it gonna be?

664
01:10:57,666 --> 01:10:58,928
You got it.

665
01:11:19,221 --> 01:11:20,916
Another one bites the dust.

666
01:11:24,393 --> 01:11:26,793
Come on. What do you got? What ya got?

667
01:11:26,862 --> 01:11:28,693
See ya.

668
01:12:03,799 --> 01:12:04,166
Whoa. Bri, what's up?

669
01:12:04,166 --> 01:12:06,134
Whoa. Bri, what's up?

670
01:12:06,202 --> 01:12:09,262
What's up, Jesse? What do you have in your hand?

671
01:12:09,338 --> 01:12:12,171
Throwing down the pink slip, just like you.

672
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:14,835
- The pink slip to what? The Jetta? - Yeah.

673
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:17,435
- You can't bet your dad's car. - It's all right.

674
01:12:17,513 --> 01:12:22,678
I ain't losing. This fool is running a Honda 2000. I'll win.

675
01:12:22,751 --> 01:12:26,915
That way, me and my dad can roll together when he gets out of prison.

676
01:12:26,989 --> 01:12:28,752
They're gonna throw him right back in prison after he kills you.

677
01:12:28,824 --> 01:12:30,985
Shit. I'm up.

678
01:12:38,601 --> 01:12:42,332
Visualize the win. Visualize the win, Jesse.

679
01:12:42,404 --> 01:12:45,066
- I'm serious. Listen to me, man. - Who you racer?

680
01:12:51,547 --> 01:12:54,539
Don't do it. I bet you he's got more than a hundred grand under the hood.

681
01:13:18,874 --> 01:13:20,933
Too soon, junior.

682
01:13:28,450 --> 01:13:29,940
Shit!

683
01:13:30,019 --> 01:13:31,782
Oh, God.

684
01:13:41,797 --> 01:13:44,732
Heads up, bro. We got problems.

685
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,234
- What? - Jesse.

686
01:13:48,237 --> 01:13:51,297
- Where's Jesse going? - He just raced Tran for slips.

687
01:13:51,373 --> 01:13:53,898
Oh, shit.

688
01:14:05,454 --> 01:14:08,355
- Where's he going? - He went to the car wash.

689
01:14:08,424 --> 01:14:10,585
Whatever. Go fetch my car.

690
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:15,526
Go fetch your car? We're not on your block anymore.

691
01:14:15,597 --> 01:14:17,690
You'd better watch who you talk to like that.

692
01:14:23,339 --> 01:14:27,867
SWAT came into my house, disrespected my whole family...

693
01:14:27,943 --> 01:14:30,275
because somebody narced me out.

694
01:14:31,046 --> 01:14:33,173
And you know what? It was you!

695
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,355
Go! Let him go!

696
01:14:58,073 --> 01:15:00,906
Get off of him! Get off of him!

697
01:15:08,951 --> 01:15:11,146
Dom, chill out, man. Come on. Let's go.

698
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:15,054
I never narced on nobody! I never narced on nobody!

699
01:16:02,805 --> 01:16:06,241
- I'm asking you not to go. - I'm doing this for both of us.

700
01:16:06,308 --> 01:16:08,242
Don't give me that crap. You're doing this for you.

701
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:10,944
- Why are you asking me to stay? - Why do you insist on doing this?

702
01:16:11,077 --> 01:16:13,136
Dom, please, don't.

703
01:16:25,391 --> 01:16:27,882
- What's going on? - What?

704
01:16:27,961 --> 01:16:30,521
- You know what I'm talking about. - No, I don't, Brian.

705
01:16:30,596 --> 01:16:33,759
So what? You always have tears in your eyes when Dom drives away?

706
01:16:33,833 --> 01:16:35,698
- What is the matter with you? - Come on.

707
01:16:35,768 --> 01:16:37,827
What's your brother racer off in the middle of the night for?

708
01:16:37,904 --> 01:16:39,428
I'm talking about the trucks. You know about the trucks?

709
01:16:39,505 --> 01:16:41,735
No, Brian. What trucks?

710
01:16:41,808 --> 01:16:43,435
Jesus Christ.

711
01:16:43,509 --> 01:16:46,535
- What? - Listen to me.

712
01:16:46,612 --> 01:16:49,080
Mia, I'm a cop.

713
01:16:49,148 --> 01:16:51,343
What are you talking about, Brian? What is this?

714
01:16:52,185 --> 01:16:55,177
Ever since the first time I met you, I've been undercover.

715
01:16:57,056 --> 01:16:58,489
I'm a cop.

716
01:17:03,029 --> 01:17:05,190
You bastard.

717
01:17:07,834 --> 01:17:09,961
You bastard.

718
01:17:11,471 --> 01:17:13,666
Get off of me, Brian!

719
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:16,208
Listen to me!

720
01:17:16,275 --> 01:17:20,177
Everything I ever said I felt about you was real, I swear to God.

721
01:17:20,246 --> 01:17:23,545
You have to believe me. But right now, this isn't about you and me.

722
01:17:23,616 --> 01:17:26,346
Your brother's about to pull a job, and we're almost out of time.

723
01:17:26,419 --> 01:17:29,081
Those truckers, they're not laying down anymore.

724
01:17:29,155 --> 01:17:32,022
They may make it through the night, but every law enforcement agency...

725
01:17:32,091 --> 01:17:33,683
in California is coming down on 'em.

726
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:36,360
If you don't want anything to happen to your brother, to Letty...

727
01:17:36,429 --> 01:17:39,296
to Leon, to Vince, you have to just get in that car with me right now.

728
01:17:39,365 --> 01:17:41,299
You have to help me.

729
01:17:42,135 --> 01:17:45,536
Mia, you are the only person that can help me right now.

730
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:49,538
Please, Mia. Please help me.

731
01:18:01,287 --> 01:18:04,256
Civics are stashed somewhere outside of Thermal.

732
01:18:04,323 --> 01:18:07,884
They wouldn't double back. And Highway 10's too well-patrolled...

733
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:09,052
so what does that leave us with then?

734
01:18:09,128 --> 01:18:10,823
That leaves us with all this.

735
01:18:19,705 --> 01:18:22,606
- Nextel. - Yes, this is Officer O'Conner...

736
01:18:22,675 --> 01:18:25,337
serial number 34762.

737
01:18:25,411 --> 01:18:27,276
I need a cell phone trace.

738
01:18:27,346 --> 01:18:30,213
- What's the cell number? - Mia, what's the cell phone number?

739
01:18:32,618 --> 01:18:35,178
Come on, Mia. She needs Dom's cell phone number now.

740
01:18:38,458 --> 01:18:43,361
323-555-6439.

741
01:18:44,864 --> 01:18:47,765
Thank you. You get that?

742
01:19:13,693 --> 01:19:17,060
All right. We're one man short. Letty, I need you on the left side.

743
01:19:19,632 --> 01:19:22,829
Your sister's right about this one. This don't feel good.

744
01:19:22,902 --> 01:19:24,961
Don't do that.

745
01:19:26,072 --> 01:19:27,972
- Something's wrong. - Stop.

746
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:30,099
We shouldn't be doing this without Jesse.

747
01:19:31,410 --> 01:19:34,243
Look. This is the mother lode. We've been on this for three months.

748
01:19:34,313 --> 01:19:36,804
After this, it's a long vacation for everyone.

749
01:19:36,883 --> 01:19:39,317
- Let's go. - I hope so.

750
01:19:42,522 --> 01:19:46,583
Listen. The other night I had a dream that you and I...

751
01:19:46,659 --> 01:19:49,184
were on a beach in Mexico.

752
01:19:49,262 --> 01:19:50,820
- Really? - Really.

753
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:56,631
Come on. Let's make this happen.

754
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:03,474
- Keep on those scanners. - Copy that.

755
01:20:07,346 --> 01:20:09,280
All right. Let's go.

756
01:20:19,425 --> 01:20:20,357
Yeah?

757
01:20:20,426 --> 01:20:23,122
We traced the number to the northbound 86...

758
01:20:23,196 --> 01:20:26,029
mile 114 outside Coachella.

759
01:20:26,098 --> 01:20:28,726
- We'll keep the trace open. - Let me see this.

760
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:37,236
All right. I think we're about 40 miles away.

761
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:39,073
What are you gonna do?

762
01:20:40,112 --> 01:20:42,444
What are you gonna do?

763
01:21:14,413 --> 01:21:16,506
Okay! Go time!

764
01:21:32,198 --> 01:21:34,257
We're all good, man. I got nothing on the scanners.

765
01:21:34,333 --> 01:21:35,595
Keep going.

766
01:21:52,351 --> 01:21:54,251
Don't! Get back in!

767
01:22:02,895 --> 01:22:06,831
- He's got a damn shotgun! - Back off! Get him off of there!

768
01:22:09,835 --> 01:22:11,302
Shit.

769
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:24,415
Get me off this thing! Pull up!

770
01:22:25,751 --> 01:22:28,311
- Look yourself! - Come back!

771
01:22:28,387 --> 01:22:30,617
- Do it! - Pull up!

772
01:22:30,690 --> 01:22:32,158
- I can't... - You can do it!

773
01:22:32,291 --> 01:22:33,952
Pull up! I'll jump!

774
01:22:34,026 --> 01:22:35,687
Come on!

775
01:22:43,602 --> 01:22:46,002
I'm pulling up to distract him.

776
01:22:53,045 --> 01:22:55,639
Come on, boy.

777
01:22:55,714 --> 01:22:57,341
Shot doesn't get better than this.

778
01:23:02,788 --> 01:23:04,983
Son of a bitch!

779
01:23:08,627 --> 01:23:11,152
Take me off of here. I'm gonna unhook the winge.

780
01:23:11,230 --> 01:23:15,496
Try it again. One, two, three!

781
01:23:27,613 --> 01:23:30,411
Unhook yourself!

782
01:23:30,482 --> 01:23:34,248
- I can't get my arm free! - Vince, grab my hand!

783
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:36,686
- My arm! - Listen! Give me your hand!

784
01:23:36,755 --> 01:23:38,848
- I can't get my hand free! - I'm gonna pull you off!

785
01:23:44,563 --> 01:23:47,760
Dominic, hold on! Listen to me!

786
01:23:56,675 --> 01:23:57,733
Shit!

787
01:24:02,248 --> 01:24:03,510
Hold on!

788
01:24:04,817 --> 01:24:06,944
Move out of the way! I'm coming to get him!

789
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:36,773
- Yo? - Pull back for Letty.

790
01:24:36,849 --> 01:24:39,750
- Get her out of there! - I'm on it! Go!

791
01:24:48,527 --> 01:24:50,722
I got her! You get Vince off that truck!

792
01:24:58,003 --> 01:24:59,971
Come on, baby.

793
01:25:00,039 --> 01:25:01,904
You okay?

794
01:25:01,974 --> 01:25:04,943
Come on, girl. You all right? Come on. Let me look at you.

795
01:25:05,010 --> 01:25:07,240
Come on. We gotta go. Let's go.

796
01:25:49,955 --> 01:25:52,719
- Take the wheel! - What do you mean?

797
01:25:52,791 --> 01:25:54,281
Put your foot on the gas!

798
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:56,191
- What the hell are you gonna do? - I'm gonna get him.

799
01:25:56,261 --> 01:25:58,889
- Put your foot on the gas! - Okay!

800
01:26:02,868 --> 01:26:05,837
- All right. Keep it steady. - I got it!

801
01:26:07,072 --> 01:26:09,233
All right. Hold on, Vince!

802
01:26:10,309 --> 01:26:12,641
He's having a hard time holding on! Get me a little closer!

803
01:26:12,711 --> 01:26:13,643
All right!

804
01:26:14,847 --> 01:26:17,213
- Closer! - I'm moving in!

805
01:26:17,282 --> 01:26:19,648
Hold it right there!

806
01:26:20,886 --> 01:26:25,550
- Go! - You gotta hang in with me!

807
01:26:25,624 --> 01:26:27,819
We're gonna get you off this thing! Give me your arm!

808
01:26:27,893 --> 01:26:30,191
Look at me. Don't let go.

809
01:26:34,199 --> 01:26:36,690
Come on, Vince! Throw this arm around me!

810
01:26:38,437 --> 01:26:40,268
Don't let go.

811
01:26:43,942 --> 01:26:45,603
Come on, Vince! Get closer!

812
01:26:51,550 --> 01:26:53,575
Vince, get closer! Come on!

813
01:26:53,652 --> 01:26:54,744
Here we go.

814
01:26:59,925 --> 01:27:01,790
Gotta jump.

815
01:27:23,015 --> 01:27:24,448
Shit.

816
01:27:28,887 --> 01:27:31,981
It's gonna be okay, baby. I love you.

817
01:27:35,227 --> 01:27:36,159
Watch her.

818
01:27:37,896 --> 01:27:39,830
Come on, Vince. Hang in there!

819
01:27:44,536 --> 01:27:46,561
If we don't get him to an ambulance in ten minutes, he's dead.

820
01:27:47,806 --> 01:27:49,068
- Hold this. Hold the pressure. - I got it.

821
01:27:49,141 --> 01:27:50,665
Don't let go. Hold his arm up.

822
01:27:56,415 --> 01:28:00,010
Yeah. Yeah, this is Officer Brian O'Conner.

823
01:28:00,085 --> 01:28:02,246
I'm off-duty M.A.P.D.

824
01:28:02,321 --> 01:28:04,346
I need a life flight rollout right away.

825
01:28:06,024 --> 01:28:09,687
My twenty is Highway 86, mile marker 147.

826
01:28:10,762 --> 01:28:14,664
I got one trauma victim, about 24 years of age, six foot...

827
01:28:14,733 --> 01:28:16,530
maybe 200 pounds.

828
01:28:16,602 --> 01:28:19,696
He's got a deep laceration to his right arm with arterial bleeding.

829
01:28:20,439 --> 01:28:24,899
And he's got a shotgun wound, close-range, to his left leg.

830
01:28:24,977 --> 01:28:26,638
Yeah.

831
01:28:26,712 --> 01:28:29,476
Yeah. And he's going into shock.

832
01:30:08,714 --> 01:30:11,410
Put the gun down now!

833
01:30:13,018 --> 01:30:16,454
- Move your car. - Bullshit. Put it down now!

834
01:30:16,521 --> 01:30:19,319
- No more running. - I'm not running!

835
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:24,720
- Where's Leon and Letty? - They're long gone.

836
01:30:24,796 --> 01:30:27,993
Then it's over. I didn't call the police, but don't push me.

837
01:30:28,066 --> 01:30:31,001
- Put the gun down! I swear to Go... - You are the cop!

838
01:30:31,069 --> 01:30:32,627
You're a cop!

839
01:30:33,839 --> 01:30:37,331
Brian, I gotta find Jesse before they do.

840
01:30:37,409 --> 01:30:40,378
- I'm all the kid's got. - I'll call in the plates.

841
01:30:40,445 --> 01:30:43,573
P.D.'ll pick 'im up way before Johnny even gets near 'im.

842
01:30:44,516 --> 01:30:47,485
- Move your car. - Dom, stop it! It's over! Please!

843
01:30:47,552 --> 01:30:51,249
Mia, stay out of it. Move the...

844
01:30:56,728 --> 01:31:00,357
I am so sorry. I don't know what I'm doing.

845
01:31:01,566 --> 01:31:04,967
I'm so scared right now. I don't know what's going on.

846
01:31:07,205 --> 01:31:09,765
- What were you thinking, man? - I don't know. I panicked.

847
01:31:09,841 --> 01:31:14,505
I'm sorry. I don't know what I'm doing. Will you please help me?

848
01:34:55,166 --> 01:34:58,158
Call 911. You, call 911!

849
01:35:33,171 --> 01:35:36,538
I used to drag here back in high school.

850
01:35:36,608 --> 01:35:40,908
That railroad crossing up there is exactly a quarter-mile away.

851
01:35:41,947 --> 01:35:44,415
On green, I'm going for it.

852
01:38:19,102 --> 01:38:21,593
That's not what I had in mind.

853
01:39:08,051 --> 01:39:12,454
- You know what you're doing? - I owe you a ten-second car.

854
01:46:26,251 --> 01:46:28,947
I live my life a quarter-mile at a time.

855
01:46:30,588 --> 01:46:32,351
Nothing else matters.

856
01:46:33,425 --> 01:46:35,985
For those ten seconds or less...

857
01:46:37,061 --> 01:46:38,119
I'm free.
