1
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,040
I'm working my chest.
I'm working my triceps.

2
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,440
I'm working the back of my calves,
and I'm working my heart.

3
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,960
Whole body calorie burning.
Whole body muscle toning. Everything.

4
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,920
Now what about upper body?
All right. We'll do upper body.

5
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,440
Now, here's one of our new movements.

6
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,840
I want you to see the range of motion.
Just go to "Hurdle" or "Sprint."

7
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,760
Look at the sprint that I have.

8
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,440
How many people
can get that range of motion?

9
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,760
Say I wanna do just my hip flexors
or my buttocks even more.

10
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,680
I do what's called digging.

11
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,200
Look at the range of motion.
I use this for a lot of swimwear models.

12
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,240
Very, very, very important.
How 'bout Butt Squeeze?

13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,040
Yup.
I see you wanted to touch.

14
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,960
That's a good way
- Not this show! Not touching this show!

15
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,760
Hell is a teenage girl.

16
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,880
I guess I'm not exactly perfect myself.

17
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,720
But at least I have my fans.

18
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,360
I mean, I get letters every day.

19
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,040
Mostly from perverts and chesters,

20
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,000
but still...

21
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,960
I'm kinda the shit.

22
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,480
Rec time started
five minutes ago, Needy.

23
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,440
Grassy-ass, Raymundo.

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,320
Sometimes, the letters are from people
who say they're praying for me.

25
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,360
They tell me everything will be okay
if I just accept Jesus Christ into my heart.

26
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,240
I say the words,
but nothing ever happens.

27
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,040
Nobody comes back.

28
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,640
Nobody gets off the cross.

29
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,480
Welcome to the Mental Olympics.

30
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,400
They're big on recreation here.

31
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,840
Supposedly,
it helps us vent our aggressions.

32
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,720
Oh, yeah!

33
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,280
Personally, I think they're
trying to wear us out,

34
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,880
keep us sluggish
so there won't be an uprising.

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,040
Well, those J.V. Tactics
won't work against me.

36
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,960
I'm a kicker.

37
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,240
K- I-C-K-E-R.

38
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,440
It even says so on my chart.

39
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,680
Just one Toast 'Em, huh?

40
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,640
I like Toast 'Ems.
Well, that's good.

41
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,680
But I'm not sure a Toast 'Em can provide
sufficient energy during your day.

42
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,840
I recommend
more complex carbo?

43
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,840
- No, she didn't!
- I recommend you shut the fuck up!

44
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,080
All right.

45
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,600
Don't touch me!

46
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,440
I wasn't always this cracked.

47
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,960
I used to be normal.

48
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,800
Well, as normal as any girl under
the influence of teenage hormones.

49
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,600
But after the killings began,
I started to feel?

50
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,520
I don't know-

51
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,360
loose around the edges or something.

52
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,240
God!

53
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,400
I hate this fucking song.

54
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,320
This is where it all went down.

55
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,440
"Devil's Kettle" sounds twisted, I know,

56
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,080
but the place is just named
after a waterfall.

57
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,680
Technically,
it's not a normal waterfall.

58
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,680
It goes into this hole,
and it doesn't come out.

59
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,080
The scientist guys dropped
all kinds of things down there,

60
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,240
but nothing ever surfaces.

61
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,160
Maybe it's another dimension.

62
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,680
Or, you know, just really deep.

63
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,280
Just two months ago,
me, Jennifer and my boyfriend, Chip,

64
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,080
were completely normal people.

65
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,600
We were our yearbook pictures.

66
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,600
Nothing more, nothing less.

67
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,680
# One #
# I'm biting my tongue #

68
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,120
# Two #
# He's kissin' on you #

69
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,240
# Three #
# oh, why can't you see #

70
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,880
# One, two, three, four#

71
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,800
There's Jennifer.

72
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,000
Only back then, we were tight.

73
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,280
Sisters, practically.

74
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,920
People found it hard to believe
that a babe like Jennifer...

75
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,680
would associate with a dork like me.

76
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,560
Sandbox love never dies.

77
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,960
# Dance, dance, dance, dance #
# You are the girl #

78
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,560
# That I've been dreaming of#

79
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,120
You're totally lesbi-gay.

80
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,040
What?
She's my best friend.

81
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,440
# Ever since I was a little girl #

82
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,360
# one #
# I'm biting my tongue #

83
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,040
# Two #
# He's kissing on you ##

84
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,240
Hey, Monistat.
What's up, Vagisil?

85
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,960
You and me are going out
tonight. Uh, tonight. Why?

86
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,080
Because Low Shoulder
are playing at Melody Lane.

87
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,040
They're this indie rock band
from the city.

88
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,200
I saw their MySpace page,
and the lead singer's extra salty.

89
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,000
Plus, there'll be lots of other
salty morsels there for you.

90
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,800
Come on, Needy. I promised Chip that
I would hang out with him tonight.

91
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,840
Boo. Cross out Needy.

92
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,600
What time is the show?
I'll pick you up at 8:30.

93
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,200
My mom has a date with that
guy who owns the ham store.

94
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,600
He seems nice.

95
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,280
Wear something cute, okay?
Okay.

96
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,920
"wear something cute" meant something
very specific in Jennifer-speak.

97
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,960
It meant I couldn't look like a total zero,
but I couldn't upstage her either.

98
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,760
I could expose my stomach,
but never my cleavage.

99
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,760
Tits were her trademark.

100
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,720
Those jeans are hella low.
I can almost see your front butt.

101
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,440
It's a rock show.
This is my rock look.

102
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,360
Well, I can see, like,
your womb, so?

103
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,640
I've never even heard
of Low Shoulder.

104
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,000
Which one is Jennifer
stalking? The lead singer.

105
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,920
Girls like her don't go out
with drummers.

106
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,800
- Thanks a lot.
- No offense.

107
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,880
She'd probably make an exception if you were,
like, a drummer who's also the lead singer.

108
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,280
- Like Phil Collins.
- Who's Phil Collins?

109
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,360
Forget it.
He's seminal, but whatever.

110
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,320
Anyway, this singer guy,
Jennifer says he's extra salty, so-

111
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,800
Salty.

112
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,160
Salty means beautiful.

113
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,080
Well, then you must be
soy sauce, babe.

114
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,400
Jennifer's here.

115
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,400
How do you know?
Needy!

116
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,400
Quit tampooning yourself
and get down here.

117
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,320
That's fucking weird.

118
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,280
Better hurry before she
gets annoyed.

119
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,680
You always do what Jennifer
tells you to do.

120
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,440
No, I don't. It’s just that I like
the same things that she likes.

121
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,960
We have stuff in common.
That's why we're biffs.

122
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,040
You guys don't have
anything in common.

123
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,240
Yeah. Okay, Chip.

124
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,160
Guess who's got the whip
until 11:30.

125
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,200
A 2003 Chrysler Sebring,
and it's all mine.

126
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,720
Oh, hi, Chip.

127
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,520
It smells like Thai food in here.

128
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,720
- Have you guys been fucking?
- You're gross.

129
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,240
- You're gross. You're gross.
- You're so gross.

130
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,880
Fuck you.
Let's go to the club.

131
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,880
Melody Lane is not a club.
It's a bar.

132
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,240
It's not even a bar.
It's like a bingo hall with taps.

133
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,920
Eat my ass, Chip. You're just Jell-O
'cause you're not invited.

134
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,240
I'm not jealous.
That place is disgusting.

135
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,080
Everyone in there has a
mustache. You're totally Jell-O.

136
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,160
You're lime-green Jell-O, and you
can't even admit it to yourself.

137
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,040
Stop kidnapping my girlfriend.

138
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,680
You wish.

139
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,640
Chip was right.

140
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,720
Melody Lane is definitely not a club.

141
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,720
Clubs are for
attractive people in populous urban areas.

142
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,760
Clubs have D.J.'s and champagne.

143
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,240
As they come around the corner-

144
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,520
All we have is
a jukebox and a sticker toilet.

145
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,400
# You wanna fly
Don't want your feet on the ground #

146
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,520
# You stay up, you won't come down #

147
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,080
I cannot wait until I'm
old enough to get wasted.

148
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,760
Hey, Jennifer.
You look really pretty.

149
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,760
What up, Craig?

150
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,200
He thinks he's cute enough for me.
And that's why he's in retard math.

151
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,040
Swing and miss.

152
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,240
Hey, it's Ahmet from India,
that foreign exchange guy.

153
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,040
I wonder if he's circumcised.

154
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,560
I always wanted
to try a sea cucumber.

155
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,720
Ew.

156
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,600
Jennifer Check. Shouldn't
poison yourself with that shit.

157
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,600
Unless you want me
to arrest ya for possession.

158
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,560
You're gonna arrest me? You're not
even out of the academyyet, Roman.

159
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,400
Two more months.
Then I'm on the force for reals.

160
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,920
Are you, uh?
you're gonna cuff me?

161
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,680
Don't do that.

162
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,640
Okay? Not here.

163
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,240
Hey, that's the band.

164
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,080
Mmm. You can totally tell
they're from the city.

165
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,400
Yeah, 'cause they're wearing eyeliner.
They look like a bunch of faygos.

166
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,600
Well, you would think that, Roman,
because you're a small-time Gomer.

167
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,240
I wish we had more guys
like that in Devil's Kettle.

168
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,720
All stylish and shit.

169
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,400
I think they need two groupies.

170
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,840
No! No. Come on.
Don't be so J.V., Needy.

171
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,600
They’re just boys, morsels.
We have all the power.

172
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,560
Don't you know that?
These things?

173
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,800
These are like
smart bombs. Okay?

174
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,400
You point them in the right
direction, and shit gets real.

175
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,320
Hi.
Hi.

176
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,680
Uh?We just wanted
to meet you or something.

177
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,760
I'm Jennifer Check,
and this is my friend.

178
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,880
Hi. I'm Nikolai.

179
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,560
This is, uh?
These guys are my band.

180
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,640
Low Shoulder. Yeah, we've
heard?I've heard about you.

181
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,360
You play your instruments
really super good.

182
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,000
Thank you.
We are professionals.

183
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,280
Hey. Sorry.
Could I ask you a question?

184
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,720
Um, why would you wanna play
all the way out here in Devil's Kettle?

185
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,800
You live in the city, right?
Yeah.

186
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,000
But, you know, I think it's really important
sometimes to try and connect with our fans...

187
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,240
in the shitty areas too.

188
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,360
That's amazing.

189
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,400
Can I, um?Can I buy you a drink?

190
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,160
Sure. What are we having?

191
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,320
They have this really awesome
9/11 tribute shooter.

192
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,680
It's red, white and blue, but you have to
drink it really fast or it turns brownish.

193
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,360
All right. Well, we'll
drink it fast. Okay.

194
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,360
- Okay.
- I'll be right back.

195
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,720
Hey, how- how are you
gonna get alcohol?

196
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,720
Um, I'll just play Hello Titty
with the bartender.

197
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,000
Aw, shit.

198
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,600
Dirk, what about her?

199
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,640
- Who, Jan Brady?
- No, man. Fuck you.

200
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,480
I'm talking about the one who went to get
me a drink. The State Fair Butter Princess.

201
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,520
That's the one. I don't
know. Are you sure she's-

202
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,240
Listen, I grew up
in a town like this, okay?

203
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,240
There's always that girl. They love to
show it off, but they do not give it up.

204
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,040
You told us
you were from Brooklyn.

205
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,000
My point is, this girl is
definitely a virgin, okay?

206
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,280
- I know girls like that. I've dated chicks?
- I don't know.

207
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,320
Well, we didn't drive all the way
out here for nothing, so...

208
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,720
- Excuse me.
- Hey.

209
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,360
Hey. That's my best friend
that you're talking about.

210
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,640
And you're right.
She is a virgin.

211
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,000
And that beats sleeping
with creeps like you.

212
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,920
Tower One isn't full enough.

213
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,200
Those guys are rank, Jen.
Just forget about it.

214
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,120
You know what? I think
the lead singer wants me.

215
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,960
Only because he thinks that you're
a virgin. I heard them talking.

216
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,360
What? I'm not even a backdoor
virgin anymore, thanks to Roman.

217
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,680
And by the way, that hurts.

218
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,640
I couldn't even go to Flags
the next day.

219
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,200
I had to stay home
and sit on a bag of frozen peas.

220
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,040
Oh, my God.

221
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,200
Good evening, Devil's
Lake. Devil's Kettle!

222
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,200
Fuckin'- A right, it is.

223
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,880
# All alone in an empty room #

224
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,320
# Nothing left
but the memories #

225
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,240
# Of when #

226
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,960
# I had my best friend #

227
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,560
# And I don't know
how we ended up here #

228
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,240
# I don't know
but it's never been so clear#

229
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,280
# We made a mistake, dear#

230
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,440
# And I see #

231
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,800
# The broken glass
in front of me #

232
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,720
# I see #

233
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,040
# Your shadow hanging over me #

234
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,640
# And your face, I can see #

235
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,880
# Through the trees #

236
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,000
# I will find you #

237
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,400
# I will heal #

238
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,160
# The ruins left inside you #

239
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,520
# 'Cause I'm still here breathing now #

240
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:32,600
# I'm still here breathing now #

241
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,000
# Until I'm set free #

242
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,640
# Go quiet through the trees #

243
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,640
# And I remember
how we used to talk #

244
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,720
# About the places we would go
when we grew up #

245
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,200
# And all that we were gonna find #

246
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,600
# And I remember
watching our seeds grow #

247
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,360
# And how you cried when you
saw the first leaf show ##

248
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,880
Everybody, run!

249
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,880
We can't get through there!

250
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,800
I know where to go!

251
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,560
Hey. Hey. Jen?

252
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,440
Hey.

253
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,680
Jennifer? Oh, thank God
you guys are all right.

254
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,400
I've been looking
everywhere for you two.

255
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,480
Listen, it's really
dangerous out here.

256
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,320
You wanna head someplace
safer, like my van? What?

257
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,640
I'm in survival mode right now,
and I want us to get to a familiar place.

258
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,040
And right now, I feel
like that's my van. Okay.

259
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,000
Okay, this one's
in shock. Great.

260
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,400
Are you in shock?
Have some of that.

261
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,640
No.

262
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,760
Jennifer?

263
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,160
Hey.

264
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,400
Let's go, Jennifer!
Let's go to the van.

265
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,200
I wanna go to your really cool van.
Needy, let's go see his van.

266
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,080
Why? Why should we?

267
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,480
We have the Sebring.
Let’s just get out of here! Please?

268
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,480
Needy, stop it!
Just shut up.

269
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,880
I watched her get into that van,

270
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,440
and I knew something awful
was going to happen.

271
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,440
He was skinny and twisted and evil,

272
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,640
like this petrified tree
I saw when I was a kid.

273
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,640
Oh.

274
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,280
- Hey, Niedermeyer.
- Oh, thank God you're there.

275
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,560
What's wrong?
Jennifer's gone.

276
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,960
She ran off with that rock band,
and Melody Lane burned down.

277
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,200
You're okay, right?
Uh, yeah.

278
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,520
But there was this huge stampede,

279
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,720
and all the people that fainted
got run over,

280
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,600
and you could hear
their bones breaking.

281
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,920
And the people?

282
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,160
Like, the people on fire
just smelled like?

283
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,160
This is crazy. Jennifer's
still with those creeps.

284
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,440
They took her in their spooky van
with the windows all blacked out.

285
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,000
- Did you get the make and model?
- I don't know, Chip. An '89 Rapist?

286
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,120
She's still in there.
We have to go find her.

287
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,240
Who cares about Jennifer
and those douche bags...

288
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,240
with their douche bag haircuts
and their man-scara?

289
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,320
People just burned to death.

290
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,960
Oh, cheese
and fries. There's somebody here!

291
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,120
I'm all alone.
I'm freaked out.

292
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,760
- Where is your mom?
- Swing shift.

293
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,920
Stay on the phone
with me, okay?

294
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,600
Needy, do you want me
to come over or something?

295
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,920
I don't know. Maybe.

296
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,600
Needy?

297
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,840
Okay, so now
there's no one here.

298
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,440
That's so strange.

299
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,440
Maybe I'm going crazy.

300
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,680
It's probably nothing.

301
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,400
Look, I'll call you later.
Okay.

302
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,880
Hi.

303
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,240
Jen.

304
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,240
What happened?

305
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:21,440
Jen?

306
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,480
Um?

307
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:51,520
My mom got that at Boston Market,
and I'm?I'm not supposed to-

308
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,720
Jennifer. Jennifer?

309
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,880
Jennifer.

310
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,200
Are you scared?

311
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,480
Jennifer!

312
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,280
Another body under here!

313
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,000
I heard Needy and Jennifer
were there,

314
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,880
and they had to fight their
way out with a machete.

315
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,000
Look, she's not
even moving.

316
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,560
It's called post-traumatic
stress disorder.

317
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,360
My dad was in operation
Enduring Freedom,

318
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,480
and he totally, like, stopped talking
for, like, months.

319
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,680
I'll be Perfect Prom Betty,
and you be her.

320
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,400
Why do I have to be Ugly Ashley?

321
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,040
Ow!
What's wrong, Jennifer?

322
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,320
Don't tell my mom about this.
She'll make me a shot.

323
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,320
I never tell on you.

324
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,520
Where's it at, Monistat?

325
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,360
- You're all right.
- Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

326
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,320
'Cause last night
at my house, you were?

327
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,680
You do have a tendency
to overreact.

328
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,480
Remember when we were in Girl Scout camp,
and you thought that there was an earthquake,

329
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,280
but it was just two guys
with a ghetto blaster?

330
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,400
People died, Jennifer.

331
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,640
It's, like, all over the news.
National news.

332
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,560
Anybody that we know?
We know everyone.

333
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,200
Sucks to be them, I guess.

334
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,800
What is wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?

335
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,120
Besides the obvious surface flaws.

336
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,240
I knew it was real.

337
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,200
I'd been up all night,
scrubbing the carnage off the linoleum.

338
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,120
Shoot.

339
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,800
Please don't talk to yourself.

340
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,840
It's one of your more
freakish Needy behaviors...

341
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,200
and it makes us both look
like total gaylords.

342
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,880
Ew. Fuck. You need a mani bad.

343
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,240
You should find a Chinese chick
to buff your situation.

344
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,040
This is a dark, dark day...

345
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,000
for Devil's Kettle.

346
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,720
And believe me you,
I have lived through some?

347
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,240
some pretty heavy stuff.

348
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,840
We lost eight precious students...

349
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,960
including Ahmet from India,

350
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,520
several parents...

351
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,960
and our beloved Spanish teacher,

352
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,320
Se?rita Erickson.

353
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,240
No way. Erickson ate shit?

354
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,680
Now more than ever,
put aside your teenage concerns...

355
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,000
about who's a cool dude,
or who's a ho.

356
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,640
We can't let that damn fire win.

357
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,400
It already won.

358
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,600
God bless you kids.

359
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,640
There's no band practice today.
There's no anything today.

360
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,960
It's surreal, right? When just one person
dies in Devil's Kettle, it's like time stops.

361
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,440
Feel guilty just breathing.

362
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,040
Word.

363
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,000
Chip, I need to tell you
something kinda weird.

364
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,120
It's about Jennifer.
What?

365
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,320
You know how last night we were talking,
and someone came to my house? It was Jennifer.

366
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,240
She looked like she had been
beaten up or shot or something.

367
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:20,160
And then she barfed up
this, like, disgusting, prickly stuff...

368
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,640
that looked like road kill and,
like, sewing needles mixed together.

369
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,280
Yuck.

370
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,360
Well, she probably just inhaled a
whole bunch of smoke or something.

371
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,280
No, Chip. No, it was like?

372
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,520
It was, like, evil.

373
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,320
Needy, I think you might wanna
talk to the school shrink.

374
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,120
I'm not saying that
to be a dill hole.

375
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,480
Chip, I don't tell whoppers,
and I'm not crazy.

376
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,160
I didn't say you were crazy.

377
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,040
It’s just, everybody's a little messed
up about this, and it's okay to feel?

378
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,640
Discombobulated?
Yeah. Fucked up.

379
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,400
Hey, Needy.

380
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,800
- Oh, hi, Colin. - I heard you were there
last night in the fiery trenches.

381
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,960
Yeah.

382
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,000
Well, I'm glad you didn't die.

383
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,960
- Thanks.
- Seriously.

384
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,200
How are you friends
with Colin Gray?

385
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,280
I thought Colin Gray
only talked to the Dead Girls.

386
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,280
I just am. We have
Creative Nonfiction together.

387
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,160
He's a really good writer. He's,
like, all dark and emotional and stuff.

388
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,400
Oh. Well, I'm like that too.
I mean, I can relate.

389
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,320
You know, I'm not all obvious
about it like a poser.

390
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,240
Walk me home?

391
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,280
You know it, babe.

392
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,480
# It's all right #

393
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:52,000
# It's all right ##

394
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,800
Hi.
Hey, Jennifer.

395
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,800
I'm crazy sorry about your
profound loss.

396
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,040
You are crying about Craig, right?

397
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,840
He was my best friend.

398
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,560
You know, I was there last night,

399
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,040
and I was probably the last person
to talk to him, like, ever.

400
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,000
Wow.
You know what he said?

401
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,160
Craig said that he always
thought you and me...

402
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,400
would make
a totally banging couple.

403
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,280
Isn't that just so weird?

404
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,920
He?He said "banging"?

405
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,280
Feel my heart, Jonas.

406
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,560
I think it's broken.

407
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,240
Mine too.

408
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,240
You come with me,
just for a little while.

409
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,640
It's what Craig would have wanted.

410
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,960
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

411
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,080
You're so warm.
Why are you so warm?

412
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,000
Shutties.

413
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,760
Jennifer.

414
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,440
Jen.
What?

415
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,960
Look.

416
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,760
Mm-hmm.

417
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,520
They're waiting.

418
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,640
Okay.

419
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,480
Mmm.

420
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,320
Do you miss Craig?

421
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,680
Of course.

422
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,120
Well, you're gonna see
your buddy really soon.

423
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,520
What, you mean,
like, in heaven someday?

424
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,920
Nope.

425
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,240
God.

426
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,560
Let it all out, kids.

427
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,120
## You want
some baloney, Spector?

428
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,800
And that was
Low Shoulder, the local band...

429
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,040
who became unlikely heroes of the
tragedy in Devil's Kettle last night.

430
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,840
Eyewitnesses say the boys helped
numerous people escape the inferno,

431
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,440
risking their own lives
in the process.

432
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,560
That's rock and roll with a conscience,
ladies and gentlemen.

433
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,840
And guess what. We are honored to have
Low Shoulder in the studio right now.

434
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,480
Now, how you guys holdin' up?

435
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,400
We're maintaining, man.

436
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,600
It's not easy, but, you know,
the real heroes...

437
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,040
are the people of Devil's Lake.

438
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,720
I just hope we can convey 1/10th
of their courage and spirit...

439
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,760
on our upcoming album.

440
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,320
Virgin mother.

441
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,040
Crap.

442
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,960
You said it.
Hey, Mom.

443
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,840
I didn't know
you were up.

444
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,560
Yeah.

445
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,440
Oh, God. I had another one
of my night terrors.

446
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,000
Well, it's 4:00, so technically
you had a day terror.

447
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,680
Right.

448
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,280
What'd you dream about?

449
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:14,720
I dreamed some bad people
were trying to nail you to a tree...

450
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,960
with hammers and big stakes and shit.

451
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,320
Just like J.C.

452
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,440
But I didn't let 'em get you, 'cause
I'm a hard-assed, Ford-tough mama bear.

453
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,200
I can take care of myself.

454
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,120
Yeah, you say that,

455
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,400
but one day you're gonna be crying
out for me, and I'm not gonna be there.

456
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
No!

457
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,800
Fatalities have grown in a horrific fire...

458
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,800
that destroyed a popular local
nightclub...

459
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,560
In Devil's Kettle last night.

460
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,720
Yeah?
I feel so scrumptious!

461
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,320
Goody for you. You know when you
kiss a boy for the first time,

462
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,880
and it feels like your
entire body is on vibrate?

463
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,920
- Yeah?
- It's that good.

464
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,840
Well, that's nice.

465
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,080
Me, I'm still a little bit depressed
about, you know,

466
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,480
the giant, smoldering funeral
pyre in the middle of town.

467
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,560
Move-on-dot-org,
Needy. It's over.

468
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:17,680
Life is too short to be moping around
about some white-trash pig roast.

469
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,600
That's sweet, Jen.

470
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,320
You know, I tell it like it is.

471
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,080
And besides, you know what?

472
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,160
You should be happy for me
because I am having the best day...

473
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,840
since, like, Jesus invented the calendar.

474
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,880
Jesus didn't invent
the calendar.

475
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,520
Whatever.

476
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,560
Other line. Hold on.

477
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,600
- So blow it off.
- It'll just be a minute.

478
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,680
Pooh. I'm crossing you out.

479
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,760
Hey.

480
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,960
I need to see you right now.
I can barely hear you.

481
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,200
## It's because
Camille is playing the piano.

482
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,880
Knock it off, Camille!
You knock it off!

483
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,720
Can you meet me
at McCullum in 10?

484
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,760
You knock it off, Chip!
You're a penis cheese!

485
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,720
Uh, 15?

486
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,480
# Heard you're new in town #

487
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,600
# want someone to show you round #

488
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,960
# well, no one knows this place
just quite like me ##

489
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,240
- I gotta go.
- I am a god.

490
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,080
Okay. I gotta meet Chip
in McCullum Park.

491
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,640
You know, Chip is looking
really cute to me lately.

492
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,560
So, tell me, is he, uh, like, packing
some serious pubic inches?

493
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,480
What's the story down there?

494
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,720
I gotta go.

495
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,400
Why are the cops
at your house?

496
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,880
They're not. They're
at Jonas Kozelle's house.

497
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,720
Why? He try to sell fake peyote to the eighth
graders again? No, Needy. He was murdered.

498
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,280
What?
Yeah.

499
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,680
Someone ripped Jonas limb from limb
in the woods behind school.

500
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,560
They ate parts of him.

501
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,880
No one's even supposed to know yet, but my dad
just went over there and talked to the cops.

502
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,800
His mom is, like, catatonic.

503
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,920
She’s just staring out the front window
like a zombie mannequin robot statue.

504
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,840
This can't be a coincidence.

505
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,960
What are you
talking about, Needy?

506
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,480
A fiery death trap last night,

507
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,680
and now a cannibal psycho takes
down the biggest guy in school?

508
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,720
Come on. It's freaktarded.

509
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,160
Well, the bad luck's
gotta be over, right?

510
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,080
I mean, it can't get any worse,
right? It can't.

511
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,160
I mean, you agree, right?

512
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,080
You're shaking.

513
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,560
Well, I'm cold.
It's very cold out here.

514
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,840
You want my hoodie?

515
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,200
# All alone in an empty room #

516
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,920
The days marched on as usual,

517
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,040
but most of us were too numb
to enjoy ourselves.

518
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,960
Most of us.

519
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,920
# And I don't know
how we ended up here #

520
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,520
# I don't know
but it's never been so clear#

521
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:45,120
# We made a mistake, dear#

522
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,840
To the rest of the
world, we were famous. We were saints.

523
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,960
Our town's only bar
had burned to the ground,

524
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,560
and our star linebacker
was someone's Snack Pack.

525
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,920
The whole country got a huge
tragedy boner for Devil's Kettle.

526
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,280
And the press, God! They couldn't
get enough of our little world of shit.

527
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,240
# Through the trees #

528
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,560
# I will find you #

529
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,120
# I will heal #

530
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,600
# The ruins left inside you #

531
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,280
# 'Cause I'm still here breathing now #

532
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:28,200
# I'm still here breathing now #

533
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,440
# Until I'm set free #

534
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,880
# Go quiet through the trees ##

535
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,360
Still, we were healing.

536
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,360
Like Chip, we figured things
could only get better. Hey!

537
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,160
We had faith.

538
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,240
We were fucking idiots.

539
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,440
Before the period ends,
I'd like to make an announcement.

540
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,400
As you all know, today is
the one month anniversary...

541
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,600
of the tragedy
at Melody Lane...

542
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,200
and the murder of Jonas Kozelle.

543
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,960
Boring. Jesus!

544
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,000
What a bitch.

545
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,200
As I was saying,
Jennifer and Needy,

546
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,160
I finally have some good news
to share with all of you.

547
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,080
The members of the rock and roll
group Low Shoulder...

548
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,600
have decided to extend a
helping hand to our community.

549
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,600
As you all know, their song,
"Through The Trees,"

550
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,080
has become our unofficial anthem...

551
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,880
of unity and healing.

552
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,360
And they have decided
to release it as a benefit single.

553
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,240
Three percent of the profits
will go to local families...

554
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,160
who have been affected by loss.

555
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,120
What about the other 97%?

556
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,960
I mean, that’s just crass, right?

557
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,680
"Crass." It means greedy,
exploitative, scummy.

558
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,680
Low Shoulder
are American heroes.

559
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,680
No, they're not!
I was there, Chastity.

560
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,880
They didn't help anybody
escape the fire.

561
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,440
I don't even know how
that rumor got started.

562
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,600
Rumor? Rumor?

563
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,760
It's true.
It's on the Wikipedia.

564
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:03,000
We wouldn't even know who they were
if they hadn't been playing that night.

565
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,640
- They used us.
- You take that back, Needy Lesnicki.

566
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,960
- Girls?
- We need them now more than ever.

567
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,120
That's enough.

568
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,520
I'm already sick of that song.

569
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,800
Yeah, it's really poorly produced.

570
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,800
Could the bass
be any lower in the mix?

571
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,840
No offense, but you
look really tired.

572
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,640
Is everything okay?
No. I feel like boo-boo.

573
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,320
My skin is breaking out,
and my hair is dull and lifeless.

574
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,080
God. It's like I'm one
of the normal girls.

575
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,360
Are you P.M.S.ing or something'?
P.M.S. Isn't real, Needy.

576
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,520
It was invented by the boy-run
media to make us seem crazy.

577
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,360
Don't look at me like that!

578
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,040
It’s just wearing off
or something.

579
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,640
What's wearing off?

580
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,800
Hello, Needy.
Hi.

581
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,640
Jennifer.
Hi, Colin.

582
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,920
Can I borrow your English homework
again? I forgot to read Hamlet.

583
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,040
Is he gonna fuck his mom?

584
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,440
No?I don't?I don't?
I don't think so.

585
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,200
Um, I actually wanted
to ask you something.

586
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,640
You wanna know if I'll
go out with you? No!

587
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,680
Yeah. What? L?

588
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,120
- I don't g?How'd you know?
- Just go ahead with the pitch.

589
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,000
Okay. Um?

590
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,320
Well, we've been having
a lot of fun in class, you and I,

591
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,600
and I thought that maybe you'd
like to go see a movie or something.

592
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,360
There's a, uh, midnight showing of
Rocky Horror at the Bijou next weekend.

593
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,520
I don't like boxing movies.

594
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:44,080
Yeah, but it's no?
It's not a... fucking boxing movie.

595
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,360
Um, fuck it.
Okay. Forget it.

596
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,400
- That was random.
- I'm used to boys asking me out, Needy.

597
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,480
Colin's really nice.

598
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,960
He's into maggot rock.
He wears nail polish.

599
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,680
My dick is bigger than his.
I think he's really cool.

600
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,640
You do?
Yeah.

601
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,800
Wait. Colin.

602
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,440
Why don't you just come by
my place tonight?

603
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,480
I just got Aquamatine on DVD.
It's about this girl who's, like, half-sushi.

604
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,120
I guess she has sex through
her blowhole or something.

605
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,800
Okay.

606
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,720
Great, yeah.

607
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,080
Okay. I'll text you
my address.

608
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,320
Cool.

609
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,720
Hi.
Hey.

610
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,200
Mmm. Hi, Chip.

611
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:44,400
Hey, hey.
Ugh.

612
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,120
Get a room.

613
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,640
So, talking to your mysterious pal
Colin Gray again.

614
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,600
No. He was asking Jennifer
out on a date. That's weird.

615
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,640
So are you gonna come over
tonight? Sure, I'd like that.

616
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,800
I went to Super Target
and picked up more condoms, so?

617
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,640
Thanks. Not that that
has anything to do with?

618
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,120
Oh, no, I didn't assume that.
Well, I'm?

619
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,600
Okay. I'll see you tonight then.

620
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,480
Okay.

621
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,800
# The roads are wrapped around
your waist # It's for ambience.

622
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,800
# They lead me place to place #
It's Jammin' Jasmine.

623
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,680
My mom has Holiday Scents,
too, if you’re?

624
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,880
This is nice.
# In fact, I made a career out of it #

625
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,880
# I've always thought the left
was your strongest side #

626
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,560
# But when it comes to you
now I can't decide #

627
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,920
# It's only a matter of#

628
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,200
# Time ##

629
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,120
# I can see
clearly now the rain has gone #

630
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,320
# I can see all obstacles in my way #

631
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,640
# Gone are the dark clouds
that had me blind #

632
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,440
# It's gonna be a bright
bright sunshiny day #

633
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,360
# I think I can make it now
the rain has gone #

634
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,880
# All of the bad feelings
have disappeared #

635
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,720
# Here is the rainbow
I've been prayin' for#

636
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,040
# It's gonna be a bright
bright sunshiny day ##

637
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,040
Hello.

638
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,000
Jennifer?

639
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:45,600
# I know you seen me looking
at you and you already know #

640
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,200
# I wanna love you
love you #

641
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,160
# You already know #

642
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,680
# I wanna love you
love you #

643
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,200
# You already know #

644
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,560
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

645
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,000
"Slippery Swirl"?

646
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:18,400
Yeah, it's, uh, supposed to
make it feel good for the girl.

647
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,320
Cool.

648
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,560
# Baby, you got a phatty
the type I like to marry #

649
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,200
# wantin' to just give you everything
and that's kinda scary #

650
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,560
# 'Cause I'm lovin'
the way you shake your ass #

651
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,600
# Bouncin'
Got me tippin' my glass #

652
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,920
# Normally don't
get caught up too fast #

653
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,520
# Got a thing for you #

654
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,200
# I see you windin', grindin' #

655
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,520
# Up on that floor #

656
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,680
# I know you see me looking at you #

657
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,600
# And you already know #

658
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,640
# I wanna love you
love you #

659
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,600
# You already know #

660
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:52,200
Oh.

661
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:55,040
# I wanna love you
love you #

662
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,400
# You already know, girl ##

663
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:04,120
You made it.

664
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,720
What's going on?

665
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,640
This, uh?

666
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,160
This isn't really your house, is it?

667
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,960
No, baby.

668
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,160
This is our house,
just for you and me.

669
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:30,280
We can play Mommy and Daddy.

670
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,920
Do you even know my last name?

671
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,320
Silly.

672
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,960
I've been sending you
signals all year.

673
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,440
Couldn't you tell?

674
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,720
You give me such a wettie.

675
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,080
Put it in.

676
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:33,200
Jennifer!

677
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,720
What? Are you scared?

678
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,760
I thought boys like you were really
into vermin and death and shit.

679
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,920
Here you go.

680
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,120
Nice hardware, ace.

681
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,720
No way.

682
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,000
Ow! Shit!
Ooh! Puncture wound.

683
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,040
God, that's so emo.

684
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,000
I need you frightened.

685
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,560
I need you hopeless.

686
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,720
Hopeless.

687
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,240
Hopeless.

688
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,640
Hopeless.

689
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:34,840
What? What?

690
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,840
What?

691
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,720
Am I hurting you?

692
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,040
Am I too big?

693
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,480
What?

694
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:56,120
Needy. What's wrong?

695
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,200
Is it something I did?

696
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,600
# Through the trees #

697
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,760
# I will?#

698
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,080
Mommy? Mommy!

699
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,760
Are you scared?

700
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,760
Hi.

701
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:53,080
God, Needy, enough with the screaming!

702
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,440
You're such a clich?
Get out!

703
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,360
But we always share your bed
when we have slumber parties.

704
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,880
I'm not gonna bite you.

705
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,640
Is that my Evil Dead T-shirt?

706
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,200
What the fuck is happening?

707
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,040
My God, Needy.

708
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,920
I have never heard you
drop the F-bomb before.

709
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,040
I saw you! I saw- I saw- I
saw the?

710
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,880
Slow down, tardy slip.
You sound like a sped.

711
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,200
I'm gonna call the police.
Okay.

712
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,200
Why don't you narc me out?

713
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,480
I have the cops
in my back pocket, Needy.

714
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,320
I'm fucking a cadet. Remember?

715
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,520
What do you want from me?

716
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,720
Just want to explain
some things to you.

717
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,600
Besides, best friends
don't keep secrets.

718
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,280
Right?

719
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,360
So, you remember the night of the
fire? I got really messed up.

720
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,080
And those guys from Low Shoulder
- totally evil.

721
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,960
They're basically,
like, agents of Satan...

722
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,880
with really awesome haircuts.

723
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,960
Where- Where are we going?

724
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,200
You don't have to talk
if you don't want to.

725
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:24,360
# All right,
dear Have a nice year#

726
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,000
# Teach the mean girls #

727
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,000
# How to be feared #

728
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,000
Are you guys rapists?

729
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,640
Oh, God, I hate girls.

730
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,680
# You could be satisfied #

731
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:42,320
Are you even sure
if she’s a fucking virgin, man?

732
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,200
Yes. Yes, I'm a virgin.
I'm a virgin.

733
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,080
I've never even done sex.
I don't know how.

734
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,840
So you guys should find
somebody who does...

735
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,760
know how.

736
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:57,160
See, Dirk? I told you, man.
You owe me a beer.

737
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:00,120
- What did they do to you?
- Just let me finish.

738
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:03,000
So they drove me out to the falls...

739
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:08,400
and I kept looking for a way to escape,
but it's really dark out there.

740
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,840
Where are you going? Huh?

741
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:22,120
We got a waxing moon tonight,
you guys, just like the ritual says.

742
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,000
Please!

743
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:29,080
No! Please!

744
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,160
Please!

745
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:36,040
Do one of you guys have
something to shut her up with?

746
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,880
Great. But get it nice and tight, though,
'cause I don't wanna get fuckin' clawed.

747
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,760
I don't know if we should
go through with this.

748
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,320
Dirk.

749
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:03,080
Do you wanna work at Moose
Hoof Coffee forever? I don't, okay?

750
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,880
Do you wanna be
a big loser, or...

751
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,840
do you wanna be
rich and awesome...

752
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,680
like that guy from Maroon 5?

753
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,800
Maroon 5.

754
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,920
Okay.
That's what I thought.

755
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,240
Go and fetch me
the ritual, brother.

756
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,160
Okay. What the fuck?

757
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,720
Thank you.

758
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:30,040
- All right.
- That's it?

759
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,920
Yeah. I found it online.

760
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,360
"we come here tonight
to sacrifice the body of"?

761
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,680
What is your name again?
Tiffany?

762
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,280
My name is Jennifer.
Super.

763
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:48,440
"we come here tonight to sacrifice the
body of Jennifer from Devil's Kettle."

764
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,120
Please, please.
Please, please, don't do this.

765
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,760
I'll do anything.
I'll do anything you want.

766
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,800
Do you know how hard it is to make it
as an indie band these days?

767
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:07,040
There's so many of us,
and we're all so cute...

768
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:09,600
and it's like,
if you don't get on Letterman...

769
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,320
or some retarded soundtrack,
you're screwed, okay?

770
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,920
Satan is our only hope.

771
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,200
We're in league with the beast now, and we
have to make a really big impression on him.

772
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,640
And to do that, we're going to
have to butcher you and bleed you.

773
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,920
And then Dirk here's
gonna wear your face.

774
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,560
Relax. I'm kidding about the face.
The rest is gonna happen though.

775
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:36,360
But you know what? Maybe we'll write a song
about you. As a fan, that'd be cool, right?

776
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,800
No! No!
With the deepest malice,

777
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,560
we deliver this virgin unto thee.

778
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:52,600
Dude, that is a hot murder
weapon. It's a bowie knife.

779
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,080
Bowie? Nice.

780
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,720
- Here we go! It's gonna be gnarly!
- No, please, please!

781
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:01,080
No, please, God! Wait a second.
I just thought of something.

782
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:04,440
Jenny, Jenny,
you're the girl for me.

783
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,200
You don't know me,
but you make me so happy.

784
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:09,560
I tried to call you before,
but I lost my nerve.

785
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,160
# I used my imagination #

786
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,640
# But I was disturbed #

787
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:18,440
#Jenny, I got your number#

788
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:21,520
# I need to make you mine #

789
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:24,600
#Jenny
don't change your number#

790
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:27,920
# 867-5309 #

791
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,280
# 867-5309 #

792
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:35,800
# 867-5309 ##

793
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,480
They killed you.

794
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,400
I'm still here, aren't I?

795
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,520
They did go all Benihana on my ass with
that knife and it should have killed me,

796
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,440
but for some reason it didn't.

797
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,720
Maybe it did.

798
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:27,320
Anyway, I don't really
remember what happened after that.

799
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:31,960
I just know that I woke up
and I found my way back to you.

800
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,080
I remember.

801
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:48,520
I couldn't bring myself
to hurt you.

802
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:51,040
I mean,
I'm a really good friend,

803
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,840
but I was just so hungry.

804
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,840
Ahmet.

805
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:18,800
You made it out.

806
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,560
Are you lost?

807
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:29,080
Does your host family
know you're alive?

808
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,280
Does anyone know you’re alive?

809
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,400
You come with me.

810
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,440
We're gonna sort
all this out, okay?

811
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:50,040
And ever since then, I just knew
what I had to do to be strong.

812
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,400
And when I'm full,
like I am right now,

813
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,440
I'm, like, unkillable.

814
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:58,760
Like, I can do shit
like this. Watch.

815
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:03,640
It's really cool. Just watch. Look.

816
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:08,400
It's, like, some X-Men shit, right?

817
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:17,680
What do you mean, when you're full?

818
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:25,480
What about my mom's Kia?
Why were you covered in blood?

819
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,720
You didn't even look human.

820
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:33,840
You know, Needy, maybe you should
talk to somebody about these...

821
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,440
disturbing thoughts
that you're having.

822
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:39,400
We're all really concerned.

823
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:41,960
Especially Chip.

824
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,800
I think he may be having
second thoughts about you.

825
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:48,720
Leave. Come on, Needy.
Let me stay the night.

826
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:52,280
We can play boyfriend-girlfriend
like we used to.

827
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,680
What are you doing?
Um, you said to leave.

828
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,440
See you at school.

829
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:40,920
We are gathered here
to celebrate the life of Colin Gray,

830
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,800
who was plucked
from the prime of his youth.

831
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,480
No! No!

832
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,800
They did a big
memorial assembly for Colin at school.

833
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:02,320
And we had to watch another presentation
about curfews and the buddy system...

834
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,000
and how to deal with grief.

835
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:08,000
But nobody seemed to care anymore.

836
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:10,480
Sorrow was last week's emotion.

837
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:15,560
Sure, we all hoped
this would be the last funeral,

838
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,880
but I knew better.

839
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,360
So I did some research.

840
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,040
Paranormal research.

841
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:37,520
"offering a virgin to Satan."

842
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:40,440
"If the sacrifice is impure-

843
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,560
Human and demonic relations"?

844
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,640
"Destroying a demon.

845
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,200
"Demons are weakest when hungry,

846
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,880
but a blade to the heart
is the surest way to kill the beast."

847
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:01,720
Jennifer and I hadn't spoken
since our encounter in my room.

848
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:06,160
Actually, I hadn't really
spoken to anyone.

849
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,040
Hey.

850
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,000
Just bought our formal tickets.

851
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:28,840
Did you make reservations
at the Cheesecake Factory?

852
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:33,560
Chip, I can't go
to the dance with you.

853
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,040
What? Why?

854
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:38,400
Look, just trust me.
You shouldn't go at all.

855
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,760
What are you talking about?
Not here.

856
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:43,640
What's going on?
You're breaking up with me?

857
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,720
Please, Chip! I just need
to show you something.

858
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:47,360
Is this about Jennifer?
Yes!

859
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:50,880
But I promise you this is the last
thing?Needy, I care about you. A lot.

860
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:55,000
As a person, not just some girl I made
love to for four minutes the other night.

861
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:58,520
And I'm scared of what’s happening to
you. You're acting really fucked up.

862
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:01,200
Please just let me show you.

863
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,040
Okay.

864
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:06,240
Jennifer's evil.

865
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,200
I know.

866
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:10,720
No, I mean, she's actually evil.

867
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,200
Not high-school evil.

868
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:16,160
I've been through the occult
section at the library five times.

869
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:18,400
Our library
has an occult section?

870
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,960
Yeah, it's um?it's really small.

871
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,760
Uh, you have to read this.

872
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,640
"Demoni"?
"Demonic transference."

873
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:31,000
It's something that happens when you
try to sacrifice a virgin to Satan...

874
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,360
without using an actual virgin.

875
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:35,320
The guys in the band tried to
sacrifice her in the woods.

876
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:38,240
But what they didn't know is that she
hasn't been a virgin since junior high.

877
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:40,080
It all makes sense now.
Read this.

878
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:43,040
"If the human sacrifice is impure,
the result may still be attained,

879
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,400
"but the demon will forever reside
in the soul of the victim.

880
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:48,160
She must forever feed on flesh
to sustain the demon."

881
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:50,400
- Okay.
- She's eating boys!

882
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:53,640
They, like, make her
really pretty and glowy...

883
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:55,440
and her hair looks amazing.

884
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,520
And then when she's hungry,
she's weak and cranky and ugly.

885
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,920
I mean, like, ugly for her.

886
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,760
Don't you get it?

887
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:04,280
The dance.

888
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:07,280
It'll be like an all-you-can-eat buffet.

889
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:12,320
Needy, I think you need help.

890
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,800
Oh, my God. You don't believe me.

891
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:18,040
It's not that I don't believe you.
I just don't believe this.

892
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,120
God! This is a nightmare!

893
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,320
Well, what about the dance?

894
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,640
Who cares about
the goddanged dance, Chip?

895
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:29,080
I do. I ordered your corsage.

896
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:32,240
It's an orchid. It was, like, $12.

897
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:38,640
I'll be at the dance.
I just need to keep an eye on Jennifer.

898
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:41,360
Promise me you're not gonna go.

899
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:47,520
Needy, I?
I'm not your guy anymore?

900
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:50,680
Chip, it's not safe for us
to be together right now.

901
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,320
# You hit me
once I hit you back #

902
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,400
# You gave a kick
I gave a slap #

903
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:03,360
# You smashed a plate over my head #

904
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:06,480
# Then I set fire to our bed #

905
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
# You hit me once
I hit you back #

906
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,080
# You gave a kick
I gave a slap #

907
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:14,440
# You smashed a plate over my head #

908
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,000
# Then I set fire to our bed #

909
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,040
# Ohh-oh-oh #

910
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,040
# You hit me once
I hit you back #

911
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,960
# You gave a kick
I gave a slap #

912
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,760
All over Devil's Kettle,

913
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:28,400
kids were getting ready for the dance,

914
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,600
blissfully ignorant
that some poor chump...

915
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:34,640
was on his way to being Satan Chow.

916
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:38,040
# Yeah,
whoo-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh #

917
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:44,360
In my underpants, Mom!
I need to give you something.

918
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:47,040
What, Mom?

919
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:51,720
Ladies' pepper spray?

920
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:55,000
There's obviously
a sicko out there who likes boys.

921
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:59,440
Mom, I can take care of myself.
I've been using the Bowflex.

922
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:03,000
Did you hear what Colin Gray
looked like when they found him?

923
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,640
Lasagna with teeth?
You heard.

924
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,960
You picking
Needy up at her house?

925
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:16,520
Um, I'm meeting her
at the dance.

926
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,400
I want pictures with your sister
before you go.

927
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:21,040
Yes, ma'am.

928
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,880
# Stop there and let me correct it #

929
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:31,080
# I wanna live a life
from a new perspective #

930
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:33,920
# You come along
because I love your face #

931
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,160
# And I'll admire your expensive taste #

932
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:39,160
# And who cares
Divine intervention #

933
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:42,360
# I wanna be praised
from a new perspective #

934
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:44,800
Okay, one more.
Back to back.

935
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,440
Big smiles. Cheese!

936
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:37,560
# I wonder what keeps us so high up #

937
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:57,600
# Keep very quiet
and cling to my mouth as I'm cryin' #

938
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:01,240
# So frightened of dyin'
Relax, yes, I'm tryin' #

939
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:05,040
# But fear's got a hold on me #

940
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:10,720
# Yes, this fear's got a hold on me #

941
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,520
okay, can we all?

942
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:17,520
# Yes, this fear's got a hold on me ##
Quiet down, please.

943
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,360
Uh, boys, thank you.

944
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:23,400
Welcome to the Spring Formal!

945
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:41,080
Didn't you hear
me calling your name?

946
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:43,200
You weren't calling my name.

947
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,920
Yes, I was.

948
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,240
L- I couldn't hear it.

949
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:52,320
Listen, I need to talk to you
about you-know-who.

950
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,280
Our little Needy.

951
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:56,200
I hope everybody
has had an opportunity...

952
01:14:56,280 --> 01:15:00,040
to consume some of the pecan
sandies and Cran-Grape...

953
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:02,880
that were so generously donated
by the parents club.

954
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,920
Yeah!

955
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,080
But the real treat is yet to come.

956
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:11,720
She's been acting
a little off lately.

957
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:18,120
Look, I think I know
what's wrong with her.

958
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:20,560
What? What is it?

959
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:24,480
You know how Needy has been
really upset since Colin Gray died?

960
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,160
Mm-hmm.

961
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:30,520
Well, it's not just because he was,
like, brutally murdered and stuff.

962
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:33,040
I don't wanna say this!
Say it.

963
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:37,680
Needy and Colin were intimate.

964
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:40,680
And by that...

965
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:44,000
I mean they were porking
on a semi-regular basis.

966
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,160
No.

967
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:49,800
She and Colin were doing things
that you have never even heard of.

968
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,800
Okay? Total varsity moves.

969
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:58,320
I just can't believe that she
would mess with your head like this.

970
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:02,640
I care about you
so much, Chip.

971
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,960
More than I've ever
had the guts to admit.

972
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,560
These fine young gentlemen...

973
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,960
have been generous enough
to take time out...

974
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:18,360
from their sold-out national tour...

975
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:22,280
to play our dance for free.

976
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,880
Needy didn't deserve
a boy like you.

977
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:31,400
Boys and girls, please welcome...

978
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:34,320
Low Shoulder!

979
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,840
# All alone in an empty room #

980
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:09,800
# Nothing left but the memories #

981
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:12,040
# Of when #

982
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:14,200
# I had my best friend #

983
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:16,640
Oh, you're so salty.

984
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:19,840
Yeah, you're... salty too.

985
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,800
Say it
like you mean it.

986
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:23,920
Say I'm better than Needy.

987
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,520
What? Why?

988
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:30,400
# Take my breath #

989
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:33,760
# As your own #

990
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,840
# And take my eyes #

991
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:40,480
# To guide you home #

992
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:44,680
# 'Cause I'm still here breathing now #

993
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:50,880
# I'm still here breathing now #

994
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:54,360
# And I'm still here #

995
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,600
Chip.

996
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:59,120
# 'Cause I'm still here breathing now #

997
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:06,240
# I'm still here breathing now #

998
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:09,720
# And I'm still here now #

999
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:13,280
# 'Cause I'm still here
breathing now #

1000
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:20,280
# I'm still here breathing now #

1001
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:23,720
# And I'm still here #
# I'm still here #

1002
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,400
# And you're not coming back ##

1003
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:44,960
Mmm.

1004
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,080
What are you doing?

1005
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:52,920
Swimming.

1006
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,600
Ha-ha.

1007
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:56,440
Come on, Chip.

1008
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:59,400
Show me your breast stroke.

1009
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,280
I feel so empty.

1010
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:21,840
Yeah, me too.

1011
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:26,600
Why don't you just come here
and kiss me again?

1012
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:38,360
I can't.

1013
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,840
I'm sorry.

1014
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:43,000
This just feels weird.

1015
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:24,240
Help!

1016
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,600
Needy.

1017
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:21,200
Needy.

1018
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:47,840
She can fly?

1019
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,880
She’s just hovering.
It's not that impressive.

1020
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:54,000
God, do you have to undermine
everything that I do?

1021
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:55,960
You are such a player-hater.

1022
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:58,360
You're a jerk.

1023
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:01,200
Wow. Nice insult, Hannah Montana.

1024
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:03,000
You got any more harsh digs?

1025
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:06,240
You know what?
You were never a good friend.

1026
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:09,760
Even when we were little,
you used to steal my toys...

1027
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,520
and pour lemonade on my bed.

1028
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,280
And now I'm eating
your boyfriend.

1029
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:16,000
See? At least I'm consistent.

1030
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:19,080
Why do you need him? Huh?

1031
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:21,600
You could have anybody
that you want, Jennifer.

1032
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:24,760
So... why Chip?

1033
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:27,360
Is it just to tick me off?

1034
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,720
Or is it because
you’re just really insecure?

1035
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:33,160
I'm?I am not insecure, Needy.

1036
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:35,960
God, that's a joke.
How could I ever be insecure?

1037
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:38,640
I was the Snowflake Queen.

1038
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:42,360
Yeah. Two years ago,
when you were socially relevant.

1039
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:44,000
I am still socially relevant.

1040
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:47,440
And when you didn't
need laxatives to stay skinny.

1041
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,960
I am going...

1042
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,960
to eat your soul...

1043
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:58,920
and shit it out, Lesnicki!

1044
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,000
- Thought you only murdered boys.
- I go both ways.

1045
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:20,440
Ow.

1046
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:33,040
You got a tampon?

1047
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:37,720
Thought I'd ask.

1048
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:40,560
You seem like
you might be plugging.

1049
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:02,480
Oh, Chip.

1050
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:06,160
Needy.

1051
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:09,440
I should have believed you.

1052
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,360
I'm sorry.

1053
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:15,200
No. No, no. Listen to me.
I'm gonna get some help. Okay?

1054
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:17,960
Okay? Yeah. Okay.

1055
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:25,880
It's not working.

1056
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:27,960
Fuck!

1057
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:29,840
- Come on!
- Hey, hey.

1058
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,120
I'm going somewhere.

1059
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:38,440
No, no, no. You're not
going anywhere. Yes, I am.

1060
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:42,520
I think I already died before you got
here, but I woke up when I heard your voice.

1061
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:48,120
I love you.

1062
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,080
I love you too.

1063
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:00,080
And you look totally hot
in that dress.

1064
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:03,800
Oh, you're clearly delirious.

1065
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:06,640
No, I'm not.

1066
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:14,440
Oh, Ch?No!

1067
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,440
No!

1068
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:19,320
No!

1069
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:28,120
No!

1070
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,560
Abduction and adduction, right?

1071
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:37,480
Inner and outer. But you
know what's really important?

1072
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:39,400
Hurdle or sprint.
That's huge.

1073
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:43,920
Say I wanna do just my hip
flexors or my buttocks even more.

1074
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,440
I do what's called digging. I use
this for a lot of swimwear models.

1075
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:51,320
Very, very, very important.
How about Butt Squeeze?

1076
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:56,040
Yeah, I see you wanted to touch.
Not this show! Not touching this show!

1077
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:58,360
Okay. And of course-

1078
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,360
Off]

1079
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,720
Best friends forever, huh?

1080
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,640
You killed my fucking boyfriend,
you goddamn monster!

1081
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:44,400
You dumb bitch!

1082
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:50,760
Mmm!

1083
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:55,760
You know what this is for?
Huh?

1084
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:58,280
It's for cutting boxes.

1085
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:03,320
Do you buy all your murder
weapons at Home Depot?

1086
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:05,680
God, you're butch.

1087
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:09,000
Cross out Jennifer.

1088
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:24,160
My tit.

1089
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:29,240
No. Your heart.

1090
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:52,400
Jennifer, what is it, baby?

1091
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:56,040
Needy?

1092
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:58,920
Oh, my God.

1093
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:02,040
Oh, my God!

1094
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:08,400
Oh, God!

1095
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:27,680
I don't know
who Needy Lesnicki is anymore.

1096
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:39,080
I'm a different person now.

1097
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:41,960
A person who uses curse words
and kicks orderlies...

1098
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:44,000
and sees things that aren't there.

1099
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:46,560
A very bad, very damaged person.

1100
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:50,000
But sometimes change can be good.

1101
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:52,440
For instance,
most occult scholars don't know this,

1102
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:56,000
but if you’re bitten by a demon
and you live,

1103
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:58,880
you just might absorb
some of the demon's abilities.

1104
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:02,320
You just might get lucky
for once in your miserable life.

1105
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:22,720
Where are you looking to go,
young lady?

1106
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,440
East, towards Madison.

1107
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:27,800
Hop in my chariot.

1108
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:37,200
So, why are you headed east?

1109
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,560
I'm following this rock band.

1110
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:43,560
Must be one hell of a group.

1111
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:45,880
Tonight's gonna be their last show.

1112
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:53,360
# And the sky was made of a methyst #

1113
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:58,840
# And all the stars
are just like little fish #

1114
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:03,720
# You should learn when to go #

1115
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:09,000
# You should learn how to say no #

1116
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:14,600
# Might last a day, yeah #

1117
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:25,160
# Mine is forever#

1118
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:27,920
# when they get what they want #

1119
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,600
# They never want it again #

1120
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:32,800
# When they get what they want #

1121
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:36,480
# well, they never want it again #

1122
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,280
# Go on, take everything #
And he's fucking out!

1123
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:41,560
# Take everything I want
you to # Candy chest.

1124
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:43,880
# Go on, take everything #

1125
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:48,280
# Take everything
I want you to #

1126
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:51,000
Look at this motherfucker! Don't
be filmin' this.

1127
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:53,520
Listen, go get the door.
That's a sharp table knife you got.

1128
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:55,720
Get the fuck out of here.
# Go on, take everything #

1129
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:57,800
# Take everything
Take everything #

1130
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:00,640
# Take everything ##

1131
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:12,640
# Darling Darling, darling #

1132
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:16,320
# I can't wait to see you #

1133
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:19,920
# A picture ain't enough #

1134
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,200
# I can't wait to touch you #

1135
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:25,360
# In the flesh #

1136
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:30,600
# Darling
Darling, darling #

1137
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:34,240
# I can't wait to hear you #

1138
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:37,920
# Remembering your love #

1139
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,520
# Is nothing without you #

1140
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,680
# In the flesh #

1141
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:51,720
# In the flesh
In the flesh #

1142
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:55,560
# Ohh-oh, ohh-oh #

1143
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:58,840
# In the flesh
In the flesh #

1144
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:03,560
# Ohh-ohh-oh #

1145
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:05,440
Oh, my God! I can't wait!

1146
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:07,440
They're here!

1147
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:20,720
# Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it now #

1148
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:23,920
# Say it, say it, say it, say it
Say it, say it, say it now #

1149
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,120
# Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it now #

1150
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:30,520
# Say it, say it, say it, say it
Say it, say it, say it now #

1151
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:33,840
# Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it now #

1152
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:38,440
# Say it, say it, say it, say it
Say it, say it, say it now #

1153
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:41,480
# Instead of carving up the walls #

1154
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:44,920
# why don't you open up
We'll talk #

1155
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,400
# I am ready
I am ready for a fall #

1156
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:54,640
# Instead of carving up the walls #

1157
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:58,080
# why don't you open up
We'll talk #

1158
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:01,480
# We are ready
we are ready for the floor #

1159
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:07,920
# I can't hear your voice
Do I have a choice #

1160
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:14,640
# You're sinking below
I'm using my force #

1161
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:20,920
# Instead of carving up the walls #

1162
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,400
# why don't you open up
We'll talk #

1163
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:27,920
# We are ready
we are ready for the floor #

1164
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:33,080
# Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it now #

1165
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:37,320
# Say it, say it, say it, say it
Say it, say it, say it ##

1166
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:01,280
# Okay, now, one, two, three #

1167
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:04,120
# You've got me on my knees #

1168
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:07,320
# And there's blood on the ground #

1169
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:11,720
# You keep me hanging around
the crime scene #

1170
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:15,320
# He is not hard to name #

1171
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:18,560
# Go on and take a bite #

1172
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:22,880
# And chew me up
I just want a taste #

1173
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:26,640
# when you spit me out
Put me in my place #

1174
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:32,160
# So chew me up
It's written on your face tonight #

1175
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:36,000
# I give myself for you #

1176
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:39,160
# Nothing left to lose #

1177
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:42,600
# well, you chew me up #

1178
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:46,600
# 'Cause, baby
all I want is you #

1179
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:49,720
# Tonight ##

1180
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:03,720
# She's got a target painted on her back #

1181
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:07,840
# And keeps a list of the qualities
a good girl lacks #

1182
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,760
# She bites her lip #

1183
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:11,800
# And sips her bottle #

1184
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:16,800
# I take a drink
'cause the truth is hard to swallow #

1185
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:19,280
# ohh-ohh #

1186
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:23,680
# Sex and white lies
Handcuffs and alibis #

1187
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:26,880
# She lays her halo on the pillow
where she sleeps #

1188
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:29,600
# Her heart beats red wine #

1189
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:31,800
# My toxic valentine #

1190
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:35,240
# Lays her halo on the pillow
that used to be #

Handcuffs and alibis #

# She lays her halo on the pillow

# That used to be mine ##
