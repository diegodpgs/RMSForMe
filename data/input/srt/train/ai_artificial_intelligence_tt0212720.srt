1
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:17,860
That was when the icecaps had melted
because of the greenhouse gases...

2
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,571
...and the oceans had drowned cities...

3
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:23,407
...along all the shorelines of the world.

4
00:01:23,507 --> 00:01:27,678
Amsterdam, Venice, New York...

5
00:01:27,886 --> 00:01:29,886
...forever lost.

6
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,708
Millions of people were displaced.

7
00:01:32,808 --> 00:01:35,394
Climate became chaotic.

8
00:01:35,644 --> 00:01:39,381
Hundreds of millions of people
starved in poorer countries.

9
00:01:39,481 --> 00:01:44,261
A high degree of prosperity survived
when the developed world...

10
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:48,098
...introduced sanctions
to license pregnancies...

11
00:01:48,198 --> 00:01:52,958
...which was why robots,
who did not consume resources...

12
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,564
...beyond those of their first manufacture...

13
00:01:55,664 --> 00:01:59,292
...were so essential an economic link...

14
00:01:59,501 --> 00:02:02,221
...in the chain mail of society.

15
00:02:02,712 --> 00:02:06,241
To create an artificial being
has been man's dream...

16
00:02:06,341 --> 00:02:08,969
...since the birth of science.

17
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:13,582
Not merely from the modern age
when our forebears created...

18
00:02:13,682 --> 00:02:18,044
...the first thinking machines,
primitive ones that played chess.

19
00:02:18,144 --> 00:02:20,355
How far we have come.

20
00:02:21,898 --> 00:02:27,112
The artificial being is a reality,
a perfect simulacrum...

21
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,325
...articulated in limb,
articulate in speech...

22
00:02:32,826 --> 00:02:35,971
...and not lacking in human response.

23
00:02:41,042 --> 00:02:44,504
And even pain-memory response.

24
00:02:49,092 --> 00:02:52,887
How did that make you feel?
Angry? Shocked?

25
00:02:53,096 --> 00:02:57,431
I don't understand.
- What did I do to your feelings?

26
00:02:57,517 --> 00:02:59,517
You did it to my hand.

27
00:03:00,687 --> 00:03:02,687
All right.

28
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,067
There's the rub.

29
00:03:06,776 --> 00:03:08,511
Undress.

30
00:03:08,611 --> 00:03:13,766
At Cybertronics, the artificial being
has reached its highest form.

31
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:16,060
The universally adapted Mecha...

32
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,605
...the basis for hundreds of models
serving humans...

33
00:03:19,705 --> 00:03:22,650
...in all the multiplicity of daily life.

34
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,318
That's far enough.

35
00:03:24,418 --> 00:03:28,464
But we have no reason
to congratulate ourselves.

36
00:03:28,714 --> 00:03:32,635
We are rightly proud of it.

37
00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:35,429
But what does it amount to?

38
00:03:35,888 --> 00:03:37,888
Sheila, open.

39
00:03:56,575 --> 00:03:58,828
A sensory toy...

40
00:03:59,286 --> 00:04:02,690
...with intelligent behavioral circuits...

41
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,735
...using neurone-sequencing technology...

42
00:04:05,835 --> 00:04:08,921
...as old as I am.

43
00:04:10,506 --> 00:04:15,870
I believe that my work on mapping
the impulse pathways in a neurone...

44
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,764
...can enable us to construct...

45
00:04:19,014 --> 00:04:22,935
...a Mecha of a qualitatively different order.

46
00:04:24,103 --> 00:04:26,103
I propose...

47
00:04:26,772 --> 00:04:29,274
...that we build a robot...

48
00:04:30,651 --> 00:04:32,011
...who can love.

49
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:34,111
Love?

50
00:04:34,863 --> 00:04:39,028
But we ship thousands
of lover-models every month.

51
00:04:39,201 --> 00:04:43,480
Of course. You're your own
best customer, Syatyoo-Sama.

52
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,875
Quality control is very important.

53
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,973
Tell me, what is love?

54
00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:04,626
Love is first widening my eyes...

55
00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:08,338
...quickening my breathing,
warming my skin and--

56
00:05:08,438 --> 00:05:11,838
And so on, exactly so.
Thank you, Sheila.

57
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:15,762
I wasn't referring to sensuality simulators.

58
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:18,698
The word that I used was 'love.'

59
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:21,893
Like the love of a child for its parents.

60
00:05:21,993 --> 00:05:26,414
I propose that we build
a robot-child who can love.

61
00:05:26,623 --> 00:05:31,403
A robot-child who will genuinely love
the parent it imprints on...

62
00:05:31,503 --> 00:05:33,530
...with a love that never ends.

63
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,755
A child-substitute Mecha?

64
00:05:35,757 --> 00:05:39,752
But a Mecha with a mind,
with neuronal feedback.

65
00:05:39,844 --> 00:05:43,081
I'm suggesting that love will be the key...

66
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:46,960
...by which they acquire
a subconscious never before achieved.

67
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,629
An inner world of metaphor,
of intuition...

68
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:53,358
...of self-motivated reasoning,
of dreams.

69
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:58,154
A robot that dreams?
How exactly do we pull this off?

70
00:05:58,363 --> 00:06:00,657
It occurs to me...

71
00:06:00,865 --> 00:06:05,019
...with all this animus existing
against Mechas today...

72
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:08,982
...it isn't just creating a robot who can love.

73
00:06:09,082 --> 00:06:13,736
But isn't the real conundrum,
can a human love them back?

74
00:06:13,836 --> 00:06:18,700
Ours will be a perfect child, always
loving, never ill, never changing.

75
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,578
With all the childless couples
yearning for a license...

76
00:06:22,678 --> 00:06:27,875
...our Mecha will open up a new
market and fill a great human need.

77
00:06:27,975 --> 00:06:30,837
But you haven't answered my question.

78
00:06:30,937 --> 00:06:34,899
If a robot could genuinely love a person...

79
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:41,269
...what responsibility does that person
hold toward that Mecha in return?

80
00:06:42,782 --> 00:06:46,394
It's a moral question, isn't it?
- The oldest one of all.

81
00:06:46,494 --> 00:06:51,254
But in the beginning, didn't God
create Adam to love him?

82
00:08:20,504 --> 00:08:24,449
'The baby was born
as the first leaves of autumn fell.

83
00:08:24,549 --> 00:08:28,345
A baby boy.
And Marian's wish came true.

84
00:08:28,553 --> 00:08:30,764
The boy had white hair.

85
00:08:30,972 --> 00:08:34,882
He was baptized Martin,
after his grandfather.'

86
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:45,136
Dr. Frazier, good to see you.

87
00:08:45,236 --> 00:08:48,598
There was an article in
the Journal of Chinese Medicine.

88
00:08:48,698 --> 00:08:49,808
Hello, Monica.

89
00:08:49,908 --> 00:08:53,895
They talked about virus locators.
Did you read it?

90
00:08:53,995 --> 00:08:55,995
I can still hear you.

91
00:09:00,126 --> 00:09:02,879
I'm worried about her.
- I know.

92
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:07,592
She feels that she should mourn
the death of your son.

93
00:09:07,592 --> 00:09:10,954
After five years, you feel
you should mourn too.

94
00:09:11,054 --> 00:09:15,250
But medicine says mourning is
inappropriate. Martin is pending.

95
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,350
Pending.

96
00:09:19,395 --> 00:09:23,149
So all her grief goes undigested.

97
00:09:25,735 --> 00:09:28,721
Henry, your son may be
beyond our science.

98
00:09:28,821 --> 00:09:32,561
But it's your wife who can still be reached.

99
00:09:42,418 --> 00:09:46,864
The screening process was tougher
than building the prototype.

100
00:09:46,964 --> 00:09:51,369
Of our 2000 employees,
only a few met your requirements.

101
00:09:51,469 --> 00:09:52,703
Initiate.

102
00:09:52,803 --> 00:09:55,039
Employment record,
quality of lifestyle.

103
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:58,351
Query. Internal data.

104
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:03,606
Loyalty to the firm,
and in this individual's case...

105
00:10:03,814 --> 00:10:08,489
...a family tragedy that may
qualify him above the rest.

106
00:10:11,989 --> 00:10:13,989
I'll see him.

107
00:10:17,453 --> 00:10:18,729
Henry.

108
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:22,416
Don't kill me.
- What are you doing?

109
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:27,421
I love you. Don't kill me.

110
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,301
The door's closed.

111
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:12,341
I like your floor.

112
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,256
I can't accept this. There is
no substitute for your own child.

113
00:11:28,356 --> 00:11:32,928
It's not too late to take him back.
- What were you thinking?

114
00:11:33,028 --> 00:11:37,432
I'll do whatever you want.
- Do you think I can just...?

115
00:11:37,532 --> 00:11:41,911
I'll do whatever you want.
- I don't know what to do.

116
00:11:42,537 --> 00:11:46,107
I'll return him to Cybertronics
in the morning.

117
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:48,207
It's gone.

118
00:11:50,795 --> 00:11:52,795
Good.

119
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:56,801
I mean, Henry, did you see his face?

120
00:11:57,385 --> 00:11:59,512
He's so real.

121
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:04,350
But he's not.
- No, he's not.

122
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:09,914
Inside, he's like the rest, isn't he?
- 100 miles of fiber, yeah.

123
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:15,862
But outside, he just looks so real...

124
00:12:17,697 --> 00:12:20,199
...like he is a child.

125
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:23,411
A Mecha-child.

126
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:32,126
A child.

127
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:10,358
The faith my company has placed
on me, on us, is extraordinary.

128
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:15,237
There are a few procedures to follow
if you decide to keep David.

129
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:19,867
If you keep him, an imprinting
protocol consisting of seven words...

130
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:23,788
...needs to be spoken to David
in this order here.

131
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:28,417
For our own protection,
this imprinting is irreversible.

132
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:32,880
His love would be sealed
and we'd be part of him forever.

133
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,092
Because of this, after imprinting,
no Mecha-child can be resold.

134
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,553
If a parent decides not to keep it...

135
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:42,890
...they must return it
to Cybertronics for destruction.

136
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:47,227
I had to sign an agreement or
they wouldn't let you see David.

137
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,387
You have to sign it too. Right here.

138
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:52,107
Monica...

139
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:56,044
...don't imprint until you're entirely sure.

140
00:13:56,628 --> 00:14:00,966
Silly man. Of course I'm not sure.

141
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:31,079
Would you like me to sleep now?

142
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,250
Good idea. Good idea.
Monica?

143
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:39,671
Well, it's late, you know.
It's after 9.

144
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,550
How late do they let you stay up?

145
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,798
I can never go to sleep.

146
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:49,372
But I can lay quietly and not make a peep.

147
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:53,376
Those pajamas will fit.
We'll check on you in the morning.

148
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,476
Dress me?

149
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:59,983
I'm gonna say good night
while you boys be boys.

150
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
Raise your arms.

151
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,897
Is it a game?
- Yes.

152
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,400
Hide-and-seek.

153
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:51,067
I found you.

154
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:56,783
That's your room. Just go and play.

155
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:19,998
I found you.

156
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:22,600
Out. Out. Get out of here.

157
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:25,478
And close the goddamn door.

158
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,482
Is it a game?

159
00:22:16,582 --> 00:22:19,335
Now, I'm gonna read some words.

160
00:22:19,543 --> 00:22:25,341
They won't make any sense, but I
want you to listen to them anyway.

161
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:28,511
And look at me all the time.

162
00:22:28,844 --> 00:22:30,844
Can you do that?

163
00:22:31,055 --> 00:22:33,055
Yes, Monica.

164
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:42,091
Can you feel my hand
on the back of your neck?

165
00:22:42,191 --> 00:22:43,759
Yes.

166
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:46,695
Does any of this hurt?
- No.

167
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:49,073
Okay, now...

168
00:22:49,365 --> 00:22:51,365
...look at me.

169
00:22:51,867 --> 00:22:53,867
Ready?

170
00:22:56,955 --> 00:22:58,955
Cirrus.

171
00:23:01,085 --> 00:23:03,085
Socrates.

172
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:07,089
Particle.

173
00:23:08,634 --> 00:23:10,634
Decibel.

174
00:23:12,638 --> 00:23:14,638
Hurricane.

175
00:23:14,765 --> 00:23:16,765
Dolphin.

176
00:23:18,393 --> 00:23:20,393
Tulip.

177
00:23:22,689 --> 00:23:24,689
Monica.

178
00:23:26,318 --> 00:23:28,318
David.

179
00:23:29,112 --> 00:23:31,112
Monica.

180
00:23:42,417 --> 00:23:44,417
All right.

181
00:23:46,004 --> 00:23:48,469
I wonder if I did that right.

182
00:23:51,384 --> 00:23:54,304
What were those words for, Mommy?

183
00:23:58,308 --> 00:24:00,308
What did you call me?

184
00:24:01,686 --> 00:24:03,686
Mommy.

185
00:24:05,815 --> 00:24:08,026
Who am l, David?

186
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,616
You are my mommy.

187
00:24:37,013 --> 00:24:40,792
You smell lovely. I love it
when you wear this stuff.

188
00:24:40,892 --> 00:24:43,461
Will you love me when it's all gone?
- No.

189
00:24:43,561 --> 00:24:44,671
Stop it.

190
00:24:44,771 --> 00:24:49,259
We can marry again and begin with
a scent that's not in short supply.

191
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:51,527
Come on, we're late.

192
00:24:54,655 --> 00:24:56,724
Hello, David.
- Hello, Henry.

193
00:24:56,824 --> 00:24:59,869
Walk us out, sweetheart.
Come on.

194
00:25:01,537 --> 00:25:03,537
My shoe.

195
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,865
Your tie. You're hopeless.
- I'm helpless. He made our bed.

196
00:25:12,965 --> 00:25:15,134
He's just trying so hard.

197
00:25:15,343 --> 00:25:18,663
He's trying to please me.
He has a way with my coffee.

198
00:25:18,763 --> 00:25:21,749
It's creepy.
You never hear him coming.

199
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:25,936
He is only a child.
- He's a toy.

200
00:25:26,479 --> 00:25:28,522
He's a gift.

201
00:25:28,981 --> 00:25:30,981
From you.

202
00:25:32,318 --> 00:25:35,888
David, when we leave,
the doors will go smart...

203
00:25:35,988 --> 00:25:39,183
...so you can't leave your room,
but if you'd like....

204
00:25:39,283 --> 00:25:43,287
I put too much on.
- Do I smell lovely?

205
00:25:45,498 --> 00:25:47,498
Oh, God, no.

206
00:25:59,386 --> 00:26:01,386
Mommy?

207
00:26:02,264 --> 00:26:04,683
Will you die?

208
00:26:08,145 --> 00:26:11,899
Well, one day, David, yes, I will.

209
00:26:16,445 --> 00:26:18,739
I'll be alone.

210
00:26:19,239 --> 00:26:21,950
Don't worry yourself so.

211
00:26:31,752 --> 00:26:34,171
How long will you live?

212
00:26:35,255 --> 00:26:37,255
For ages.

213
00:26:38,175 --> 00:26:40,344
For 50 years.

214
00:26:41,345 --> 00:26:44,139
I love you, Mommy.

215
00:26:45,098 --> 00:26:48,101
I hope you never die.

216
00:26:49,394 --> 00:26:51,394
Never.

217
00:26:53,607 --> 00:26:55,342
Yes.

218
00:26:55,442 --> 00:26:56,676
Darling.

219
00:26:56,776 --> 00:27:01,072
We're becoming unfashionably,
unreasonably late.

220
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:05,909
Hello?

221
00:27:26,765 --> 00:27:29,485
This belonged to Martin, my son.

222
00:27:57,503 --> 00:28:01,799
His name is Teddy.
Teddy, this is David.

223
00:28:03,509 --> 00:28:06,721
Hello, Teddy.
- Hello, David.

224
00:28:07,054 --> 00:28:12,043
Teddy is a supertoy. I know
you'll take good care of each other.

225
00:28:12,143 --> 00:28:15,146
I am not a toy.

226
00:28:16,105 --> 00:28:18,105
Henry.

227
00:28:18,274 --> 00:28:20,468
Sorry.
- What were you doing?

228
00:28:20,568 --> 00:28:23,458
I'll tell you in the car. Come on.

229
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:37,126
Is 50 years a long time?

230
00:28:40,546 --> 00:28:42,546
I don't think so.

231
00:28:43,215 --> 00:28:45,593
David, I'll get it.

232
00:28:54,602 --> 00:28:57,492
Hand it to me.
- Look what I can do.

233
00:29:05,321 --> 00:29:07,321
Hello.

234
00:29:08,198 --> 00:29:09,308
Yes?

235
00:29:09,408 --> 00:29:13,743
Mrs. Swinton, could you hold?
I have an urgent call.

236
00:29:13,829 --> 00:29:16,982
Yes, I will.
David, I need the phone now.

237
00:29:17,082 --> 00:29:20,252
Monica? Can you hear me?

238
00:29:20,502 --> 00:29:23,906
Let the phone talk now.
- Pick up the phone, Monica.

239
00:29:24,006 --> 00:29:27,916
Run along, play with Teddy.
- Oh, my God, Moni--

240
00:29:28,886 --> 00:29:31,513
Hello, Henry, what is it?

241
00:29:32,723 --> 00:29:34,723
What?

242
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:37,309
When?

243
00:29:39,563 --> 00:29:41,563
Oh, God.

244
00:29:57,497 --> 00:29:59,497
David.

245
00:29:59,749 --> 00:30:04,509
The most wonderful thing
in the whole world has happened.

246
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,675
This is Martin.

247
00:30:09,426 --> 00:30:11,636
This is my son.

248
00:30:26,901 --> 00:30:29,028
Martin, no.

249
00:30:32,782 --> 00:30:37,078
We'll have a contest to see
who he comes to first.

250
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:44,213
Come here, Teddy. Come here.

251
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,754
Teddy. Come here.

252
00:30:47,589 --> 00:30:52,552
You call him too.
- Come here, Teddy.

253
00:30:52,927 --> 00:30:55,562
Come on. Teddy.
- Come here, boy.

254
00:30:55,763 --> 00:30:59,375
Come here. Come on, Teddy.
- Come here, Teddy.

255
00:30:59,475 --> 00:31:02,025
Teddy, come.
- Come here, Teddy.

256
00:31:02,103 --> 00:31:05,273
Come here, Teddy.
- Come, Teddy. Come.

257
00:31:08,568 --> 00:31:11,070
Mommy. Mommy.

258
00:31:14,699 --> 00:31:17,577
Are they torturing you, Teddy?

259
00:31:17,785 --> 00:31:20,538
He used to be a supertoy, but...

260
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:23,916
...now he's old and stupid.

261
00:31:25,793 --> 00:31:27,793
You want him?

262
00:31:29,005 --> 00:31:30,740
Yes, please.

263
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,952
Now you're the new supertoy.
What stuff can you do?

264
00:31:35,052 --> 00:31:39,707
Can you do power stuff, like walk
on the ceiling or the walls?

265
00:31:39,807 --> 00:31:43,477
Anti-gravity, like float or fly?

266
00:31:43,686 --> 00:31:45,212
Can you?

267
00:31:45,312 --> 00:31:49,150
No, because I'm real.

268
00:31:57,032 --> 00:31:59,032
Can you break this?

269
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:00,853
I better not.

270
00:32:00,953 --> 00:32:05,373
These things, they do look better
in pieces. They do.

271
00:32:05,374 --> 00:32:07,374
I can't.

272
00:32:11,672 --> 00:32:13,672
Stand up.

273
00:32:20,055 --> 00:32:24,476
Look, they made you bigger than me.
- Who did?

274
00:32:24,685 --> 00:32:28,595
They did. The dollmakers.
They made you taller.

275
00:32:33,026 --> 00:32:35,529
Why don't you look like one?

276
00:32:35,737 --> 00:32:37,737
Like one?

277
00:32:38,031 --> 00:32:40,784
You're not cute like a doll.

278
00:32:40,993 --> 00:32:44,563
You just look like someone's ordinary kid.

279
00:32:46,248 --> 00:32:48,417
When's your birthday?

280
00:32:49,126 --> 00:32:51,126
I never had a birthday.

281
00:32:51,211 --> 00:32:55,461
When were you first built?
When's your 'build-day'?

282
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:59,886
I don't remember.

283
00:33:02,389 --> 00:33:06,351
Okay, what's the first thing
you can remember?

284
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,047
A bird.

285
00:33:11,147 --> 00:33:13,233
What sort of bird?

286
00:33:15,443 --> 00:33:18,154
A bird with big wings...

287
00:33:18,947 --> 00:33:21,850
...and feathers sticking up from the bottom.

288
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,950
Can you draw it?

289
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:26,869
Yes.

290
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:49,936
That looks like a peacock.
Can you say peacock?

291
00:33:50,144 --> 00:33:51,421
Peacock.

292
00:33:51,521 --> 00:33:54,274
Can you say pee?
- Pee.

293
00:33:54,482 --> 00:33:56,862
Now say that two times fast.

294
00:34:07,662 --> 00:34:11,791
Okay. Then you gotta put the green ones--

295
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:13,999
Read to us?

296
00:34:15,169 --> 00:34:17,169
Let's see.

297
00:34:19,215 --> 00:34:21,425
Oh, yeah.

298
00:34:27,223 --> 00:34:30,351
David's going to love it.

299
00:34:31,894 --> 00:34:34,839
'The Showman went into the kitchen...

300
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:37,508
...where the sheep for supper...

301
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:40,720
...was roasting on the spit in the furnace.

302
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,806
When he saw there was not enough wood...

303
00:34:43,906 --> 00:34:47,184
...he called Harlequin
and Punchinello and said:

304
00:34:47,284 --> 00:34:51,122
'Bring me Pinocchio.
He is hanging on a nail.

305
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:56,110
He is made of dry wood and will
make a nice fire for my roast.' '

306
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:58,487
'Pinocchio worked until midnight.

307
00:34:58,587 --> 00:35:04,009
And instead of making
eight baskets, he made 16.

308
00:35:04,677 --> 00:35:08,389
Then he went to bed and fell asleep.

309
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:13,852
As he slept, he dreamt he saw
the fairy, lovely and smiling...

310
00:35:14,061 --> 00:35:16,463
...who gave him a kiss, saying:

311
00:35:16,563 --> 00:35:18,563
'Brave Pinocchio...

312
00:35:18,899 --> 00:35:24,509
...in return for your good heart,
I forgive all your past misdeeds.

313
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:28,015
Be good in future,
and you will be happy.'

314
00:35:29,034 --> 00:35:34,164
Then the dream ended and
Pinocchio awoke, full of amazement.

315
00:35:34,373 --> 00:35:37,901
You can imagine how astonished
he was when he saw...

316
00:35:38,001 --> 00:35:40,404
...that he was no longer a puppet...

317
00:35:40,504 --> 00:35:45,759
...but a real boy,
just like other boys.'

318
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:53,750
Josephine has taken a leave of absence.

319
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:57,562
Oh, my God.
Well, I saw that coming.

320
00:35:57,771 --> 00:36:02,175
How? They were fabulous together.
- Come on. She was miserable.

321
00:36:02,275 --> 00:36:06,096
He never said they were miserable.
- That's because....

322
00:36:06,196 --> 00:36:11,381
Is that because of the cutbacks?
- No idea. They don't tell me.

323
00:36:11,493 --> 00:36:15,497
Do they have a weight problem?
- So do I.

324
00:36:15,789 --> 00:36:19,709
You do not. That is ridiculous.

325
00:36:19,918 --> 00:36:21,653
I don't know.

326
00:36:21,753 --> 00:36:24,948
There's something
about inner beauty that....

327
00:36:25,048 --> 00:36:26,491
You will break.

328
00:36:26,591 --> 00:36:29,010
That is ridiculous.
- Exactly.

329
00:36:31,721 --> 00:36:36,736
Work has become so silly.
- I know what you're talking about.

330
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:46,236
Does he eat?
- I'm not sure.

331
00:36:46,778 --> 00:36:50,348
You're not supposed to do that.
- What are you doing?

332
00:36:50,448 --> 00:36:54,519
Martin, put the fork down.
- Stop, David. Will you stop?

333
00:36:54,619 --> 00:36:57,522
Martin, you're provoking him.
Stop it.

334
00:36:57,622 --> 00:37:01,277
Stop it.
- The two of you, stop. Stop it now.

335
00:37:02,377 --> 00:37:04,379
Stop it.

336
00:37:04,587 --> 00:37:06,673
David, stop it.

337
00:37:27,985 --> 00:37:32,181
There's sputum in the code lockers.
- Smell that garlic.

338
00:37:32,281 --> 00:37:34,600
We should throw in a chest mint.

339
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:39,188
Can you locate the surface?
- Don't touch the merchandise.

340
00:37:39,288 --> 00:37:43,708
It's all swamp in here.
- You made a mess of yourself.

341
00:37:47,421 --> 00:37:50,906
Spinach is for rabbits,
people and Popeye.

342
00:37:51,759 --> 00:37:53,577
Not robo-boys.

343
00:37:53,677 --> 00:37:55,679
Try to insert yourself.

344
00:37:57,181 --> 00:37:59,625
Through the pantry,
the lower shelves.

345
00:37:59,725 --> 00:38:03,521
It's okay, Mommy. It doesn't hurt.

346
00:38:08,108 --> 00:38:12,103
Deactivators are all shut down
on the left side.

347
00:38:12,404 --> 00:38:16,075
Monica.
- No. I have to....

348
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:28,445
That's not all of it.
That's not all of it.

349
00:38:30,214 --> 00:38:35,229
If you do something really,
really, really special for me...

350
00:38:36,011 --> 00:38:38,764
...a special mission...

351
00:38:39,014 --> 00:38:41,683
...then I'll go tell Mommy...

352
00:38:41,892 --> 00:38:43,977
...I love you.

353
00:38:44,561 --> 00:38:47,898
And then she'll love you too.

354
00:38:50,275 --> 00:38:52,694
What shall I do?

355
00:38:52,903 --> 00:38:57,074
You have to promise,
and then I'll tell you.

356
00:38:57,324 --> 00:39:01,787
You have to tell me,
and then I'll promise.

357
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:07,000
I want a lock of Mommy's hair.

358
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:12,464
I'll share it with you.
And if you had it and wore it...

359
00:39:12,672 --> 00:39:15,392
...she might love you even more.

360
00:39:15,467 --> 00:39:18,036
Like the princess in the movie we saw.

361
00:39:18,136 --> 00:39:22,249
When she had the prince's hair
in her necklace thing...

362
00:39:22,349 --> 00:39:24,349
...he loved her.

363
00:39:24,893 --> 00:39:26,503
We can ask her.

364
00:39:26,603 --> 00:39:31,066
No, it has to be a secret mission.

365
00:39:31,274 --> 00:39:36,071
Sneak into Mommy's bedroom
in the middle of the night...

366
00:39:36,363 --> 00:39:38,907
...and chop it off.

367
00:39:44,162 --> 00:39:47,999
I can't, Martin. I'm not allowed.

368
00:39:49,042 --> 00:39:50,652
You promised.

369
00:39:50,752 --> 00:39:55,256
You said, 'Tell me,
and then I'll promise.'

370
00:39:55,507 --> 00:39:57,507
Didn't you?

371
00:41:06,452 --> 00:41:08,452
David.

372
00:41:08,788 --> 00:41:12,273
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?.

373
00:41:12,291 --> 00:41:16,445
Talk to me. Goddamn it, talk to me.
Why did you do that?

374
00:41:16,545 --> 00:41:19,605
You're hurting him.
You'll break him.

375
00:41:22,301 --> 00:41:24,036
Henry...

376
00:41:24,136 --> 00:41:26,771
...I wanted Mommy to love me...

377
00:41:27,097 --> 00:41:28,707
...more.

378
00:41:28,807 --> 00:41:30,626
Oh, my God.
- What?

379
00:41:30,726 --> 00:41:34,381
I think I cut my eye.
I think it's bleeding.

380
00:41:34,396 --> 00:41:36,440
Come on, watch it.

381
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:45,516
It's normal for boys
to feel jealous and competitive.

382
00:41:45,616 --> 00:41:50,729
Martin's been home a month.
Brothers normally challenge each other.

383
00:41:50,829 --> 00:41:54,900
He was playing a game, he made
a mistake. He's practically human.

384
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,794
Not holding the knife.
- Scissors.

385
00:41:58,003 --> 00:41:59,488
It was a weapon.

386
00:41:59,588 --> 00:42:03,909
Why do you think he'd harm me?
- We don't know the answer.

387
00:42:04,009 --> 00:42:08,038
How is he worth the risk to you,
to Martin, to our family?

388
00:42:08,138 --> 00:42:12,434
I won't let you take him back.
- Think about this.

389
00:42:13,268 --> 00:42:18,113
If he was created to love,
then we can assume he can hate.

390
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:23,280
And if pushed to those extremes,
what is he capable of?

391
00:42:41,046 --> 00:42:46,092
Happy birthday, Martin.
I made this for you.

392
00:42:50,221 --> 00:42:55,143
Is this your little brother?
- Technically, no.

393
00:42:58,104 --> 00:43:00,899
He's Mecha.
- What's Mecha?

394
00:43:01,149 --> 00:43:03,149
We're 'org-anic'...

395
00:43:03,151 --> 00:43:05,737
...you're 'mecha-anical.'

396
00:43:05,945 --> 00:43:07,945
Orga, Mecha.

397
00:43:08,114 --> 00:43:10,241
Orga, Mecha.

398
00:43:11,242 --> 00:43:12,977
Todd, stop.

399
00:43:13,077 --> 00:43:16,987
I didn't know they even made kids.
Can you pee?

400
00:43:17,582 --> 00:43:21,194
I cannot.
- Let's see what you can't pee with.

401
00:43:21,294 --> 00:43:23,504
Guys, come on.

402
00:43:24,297 --> 00:43:26,297
Touch it.

403
00:43:26,799 --> 00:43:28,284
It feels so real.

404
00:43:28,384 --> 00:43:30,036
That's creepy.

405
00:43:30,136 --> 00:43:32,455
It feels so real.
- That is too real.

406
00:43:32,555 --> 00:43:34,555
Mecha-real.

407
00:43:36,434 --> 00:43:38,044
Does he have DAS?

408
00:43:38,144 --> 00:43:40,229
DAS what?
- Das ist gut.

409
00:43:40,438 --> 00:43:43,858
Damage Avoidance System. DAS.

410
00:43:44,066 --> 00:43:48,012
It's a pain-alert system.
Our serving man has it.

411
00:43:48,112 --> 00:43:52,517
It's so they don't go picking up fire
with their hands.

412
00:43:52,617 --> 00:43:54,785
Watch. Watch this.

413
00:43:56,787 --> 00:44:00,017
I'm not gonna cut you.
This won't hurt.

414
00:44:00,124 --> 00:44:04,629
I'm not gonna cut your skin.
Tell me when you feel it.

415
00:44:07,882 --> 00:44:10,368
Keep me safe, Martin.
- Let me go.

416
00:44:10,468 --> 00:44:14,638
Keep me safe, Martin.
- Let me go. Mom.

417
00:44:15,014 --> 00:44:17,014
Mom.

418
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,400
Henry.

419
00:44:39,204 --> 00:44:41,415
Oh, my God.

420
00:44:53,051 --> 00:44:55,686
Oh, my God, he's not breathing.

421
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:06,048
Take a breath.
Cough it up. That's a great boy.

422
00:45:06,148 --> 00:45:08,942
Thank God.
- Call Frazier.

423
00:45:09,693 --> 00:45:11,693
Get him out of the sun.

424
00:45:42,767 --> 00:45:45,312
Hey, David?
- Mommy.

425
00:45:46,855 --> 00:45:50,734
I need to speak to you for a minute, okay?

426
00:45:51,234 --> 00:45:53,234
Okay.

427
00:46:57,592 --> 00:46:59,802
These are beautiful.

428
00:47:02,888 --> 00:47:04,888
Thank you.

429
00:47:17,153 --> 00:47:22,475
I was thinking that we could go
for a drive tomorrow in the country.

430
00:47:22,575 --> 00:47:25,536
You and me. What do you say?

431
00:47:25,744 --> 00:47:28,789
And Teddy?
- Yeah, and Teddy.

432
00:47:35,921 --> 00:47:37,965
Thank you, Mommy.

433
00:47:38,924 --> 00:47:42,011
Thank you so much.

434
00:47:49,685 --> 00:47:52,980
Tomorrow's gonna be just for us, okay?

435
00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:10,370
Where are we going?

436
00:48:12,666 --> 00:48:15,085
Someplace nice?

437
00:48:20,841 --> 00:48:23,552
Are those happy tears?

438
00:48:27,347 --> 00:48:29,683
What's for dinner tonight?

439
00:48:30,725 --> 00:48:34,855
You know you don't eat.
- Yes.

440
00:48:36,481 --> 00:48:39,234
But I like sitting at the table.

441
00:49:43,214 --> 00:49:47,552
David? David, I want-- David, listen.

442
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,760
Listen to me.

443
00:49:55,601 --> 00:49:57,687
David, listen.

444
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:04,151
You won't understand the reasons...

445
00:50:04,402 --> 00:50:07,122
...but I have to leave you here.

446
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:10,199
Is it a game?

447
00:50:10,449 --> 00:50:12,449
No.

448
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:16,455
When will you come back for me?

449
00:50:16,664 --> 00:50:20,751
I'm not. You'll have to be here by yourself.

450
00:50:21,919 --> 00:50:23,919
Alone?

451
00:50:25,881 --> 00:50:27,925
With Teddy.

452
00:50:34,306 --> 00:50:35,791
No.

453
00:50:35,891 --> 00:50:39,603
No, no, no. No, Mommy, please.

454
00:50:39,812 --> 00:50:44,174
No, no. Please, Mommy.
- They would destroy you, David.

455
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:47,887
I'm sorry I broke myself,
I'm sorry I cut your hair...

456
00:50:47,987 --> 00:50:50,264
...and I'm sorry I hurt Martin--

457
00:50:50,364 --> 00:50:54,284
I have to go. I have to go.
Stop it.

458
00:50:54,493 --> 00:50:56,620
Stop it.

459
00:50:56,829 --> 00:51:00,290
I have to go now.
- Mommy, don't. Mommy.

460
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:05,571
If Pinocchio became real and
I become real, can I come home?

461
00:51:05,671 --> 00:51:08,949
That's a story.
- But a story tells what happens.

462
00:51:09,049 --> 00:51:12,719
Stories are not real.
You're not real.

463
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:22,312
Now, look.
Take this, all right?

464
00:51:22,521 --> 00:51:26,431
Take this.
Don't let anyone see how much it is.

465
00:51:26,525 --> 00:51:32,139
Look. Don't go that way. Go anywhere
but that way or they'll catch you.

466
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:34,599
Don't ever let them catch you.

467
00:51:34,699 --> 00:51:38,729
Stay away from Flesh Fairs, away
from where there are lots of people.

468
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:43,483
Stay away from all people. Only others
like you, only Mecha are safe.

469
00:51:43,583 --> 00:51:47,003
Why do you want to leave me? Why?

470
00:51:47,212 --> 00:51:51,491
I'm sorry I'm not real. If you
let me, I'll be so real for you.

471
00:51:51,591 --> 00:51:53,591
Let go. Let go, David.

472
00:51:53,802 --> 00:51:55,802
Let go.

473
00:51:59,683 --> 00:52:03,423
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the world.

474
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:33,216
I'm afraid.

475
00:52:33,424 --> 00:52:35,426
Of me?
- Yes.

476
00:52:35,635 --> 00:52:38,054
That I will hurt you?

477
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:40,721
Yes.

478
00:52:41,182 --> 00:52:43,182
I think...

479
00:52:43,476 --> 00:52:46,270
...you're afraid of letting go.

480
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:50,608
I think you're afraid of happiness.

481
00:52:51,484 --> 00:52:55,112
And this is starting to excite me.

482
00:52:55,863 --> 00:52:59,008
Are you afraid of seeing the stars...

483
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:01,075
...Patricia?

484
00:53:01,661 --> 00:53:04,466
I can show you how to reach them.

485
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:09,360
I'm afraid of what you've got under there.

486
00:53:11,003 --> 00:53:14,131
May I see what it looks like first?

487
00:53:15,675 --> 00:53:18,010
Is this your first time...

488
00:53:18,302 --> 00:53:20,596
...with something like me?

489
00:53:21,764 --> 00:53:24,141
I've never been with Mecha.

490
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:26,811
That makes two of us.

491
00:53:31,857 --> 00:53:34,485
I'm afraid it will hurt.

492
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:37,110
Patricia...

493
00:53:37,738 --> 00:53:40,713
...once you've had a lover-robot...

494
00:53:42,618 --> 00:53:45,396
...you'll never want a real man...

495
00:53:45,496 --> 00:53:47,496
...again.

496
00:53:52,127 --> 00:53:54,847
Are these the wounds of passion?

497
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:09,812
Do you hear that music?

498
00:54:16,777 --> 00:54:18,777
You...

499
00:54:18,862 --> 00:54:20,864
...are a goddess...

500
00:54:21,698 --> 00:54:23,698
...Patricia.

501
00:54:25,744 --> 00:54:29,498
You wind me up inside.

502
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:34,711
But you deserve much better in your life.

503
00:54:36,171 --> 00:54:39,216
You deserve...

504
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:42,550
...me.

505
00:55:22,258 --> 00:55:26,423
Hey, Joe, what do you know?
- Jane, how's the game?

506
00:55:30,558 --> 00:55:36,147
Hey, Joe, what do you know?
- Hello. Place a DND on room 102.

507
00:55:36,356 --> 00:55:38,356
Sure thing.

508
00:55:40,401 --> 00:55:42,401
There you are.

509
00:55:42,445 --> 00:55:43,930
Oh, Joe.

510
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:48,685
When you're done, crack your collar,
show off your operating license.

511
00:55:48,785 --> 00:55:54,990
The Flesh Fair is in Barn Creek and
the hounds are out hunting for strays.

512
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:59,529
Good thing I ran into you. Thanks.
- Sure thing.

513
00:55:59,629 --> 00:56:02,131
Mustn't keep a lady waiting.

514
00:56:38,459 --> 00:56:40,544
Miss Bevins.

515
00:56:41,837 --> 00:56:43,364
It's Joe.

516
00:56:43,464 --> 00:56:45,549
At your service.

517
00:56:46,508 --> 00:56:50,588
I've been counting the seconds
since last we met.

518
00:56:55,976 --> 00:56:58,812
Have you been crying, Samantha?

519
00:56:59,188 --> 00:57:01,690
I found a tear.

520
00:57:11,241 --> 00:57:13,660
Hey, Joe, what do you know?

521
00:57:15,871 --> 00:57:18,315
How many seconds has it been...

522
00:57:18,415 --> 00:57:21,730
...the last time you two were together?

523
00:57:22,169 --> 00:57:26,048
255,133.

524
00:57:30,677 --> 00:57:34,139
Goodbye, Sam. And never forget:

525
00:57:34,348 --> 00:57:37,100
You killed me first.

526
00:57:43,482 --> 00:57:46,526
I'm in bad trouble.

527
00:58:16,097 --> 00:58:18,850
If I am a real boy...

528
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:21,978
...then I can go back.

529
00:58:22,479 --> 00:58:25,190
And she will love me then.

530
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:27,940
How?

531
00:58:29,819 --> 00:58:33,644
The Blue Fairy made Pinocchio
into a real boy.

532
00:58:34,657 --> 00:58:37,827
She can make me into a real boy.

533
00:58:38,745 --> 00:58:42,749
I must find her.
I must become real.

534
00:58:42,957 --> 00:58:48,567
There must be someone in the whole
world who knows where she lives.

535
01:00:47,873 --> 01:00:51,209
Moon on the rise.

536
01:01:08,602 --> 01:01:13,872
It's the Flesh Fair. They destroy us
on-stage. I've been there.

537
01:01:16,151 --> 01:01:18,151
What do we do?

538
01:01:18,236 --> 01:01:20,236
We run now.

539
01:01:21,865 --> 01:01:24,075
Any old iron.

540
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:28,329
Any old iron.

541
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:33,042
Any old iron.

542
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:36,671
Any old iron.

543
01:01:37,422 --> 01:01:39,966
Expel your Mecha.

544
01:01:40,425 --> 01:01:42,827
Purge yourselves of artificiality.

545
01:01:42,927 --> 01:01:45,307
Let some Mecha loose to run.

546
01:01:45,513 --> 01:01:48,891
Any old unlicensed iron down there?

547
01:01:50,852 --> 01:01:53,062
Hey, you see that?

548
01:01:53,688 --> 01:01:55,940
Could be a human thing.

549
01:01:58,317 --> 01:02:02,947
No, he's scanning cold.
No expiration date, no I.D.

550
01:02:03,281 --> 01:02:08,686
What's a new model doing loose?
- It's a late-generation lover-Mecha.

551
01:02:08,786 --> 01:02:13,399
That's a relief from all this
antique iron. Sure he's not a man?

552
01:02:13,499 --> 01:02:15,777
I don't want another Trenton incident.

553
01:02:15,877 --> 01:02:18,937
He's a free-range Mecha running hot.

554
01:02:19,088 --> 01:02:22,403
Reel him in.
Sic the hounds on the rest.

555
01:02:53,372 --> 01:02:55,372
Shake down shantytown.

556
01:04:01,982 --> 01:04:04,025
What's your name?

557
01:04:04,568 --> 01:04:06,136
My name is David.

558
01:04:06,236 --> 01:04:10,156
Hello, David. How old are you?

559
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:12,225
I don't know.

560
01:04:12,325 --> 01:04:15,312
You need someone to take care of you?

561
01:04:15,412 --> 01:04:20,375
Would you like a nanny?
I have many good references.

562
01:04:20,917 --> 01:04:24,232
Do you know where the Blue Fairy lives?

563
01:04:47,402 --> 01:04:51,197
Let out the line.
Steady your drift.

564
01:04:54,075 --> 01:04:56,119
Open the lower hold.

565
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:09,048
Don't be afraid, David.

566
01:05:26,899 --> 01:05:28,899
I'll break, David.

567
01:06:12,528 --> 01:06:14,528
Hello.

568
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:16,991
Anybody lose this?

569
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:19,199
Hello.

570
01:06:19,243 --> 01:06:21,243
This your dog?

571
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,250
Take it to lost and found.

572
01:06:27,376 --> 01:06:29,545
Lost and found.

573
01:06:37,344 --> 01:06:41,181
Do you know David?
- Where's the 'off' switch?

574
01:06:42,808 --> 01:06:44,808
Where's David?

575
01:06:46,728 --> 01:06:49,439
Can you help me find David?

576
01:06:51,733 --> 01:06:54,403
I have to find David.

577
01:06:55,529 --> 01:06:58,031
Are you taking me to David?

578
01:07:47,413 --> 01:07:50,400
Could you shoot me over the propeller?

579
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:54,629
I don't need to go through it.
I changed my mind.

580
01:07:55,129 --> 01:07:59,801
Gentlemen, start your engines.

581
01:08:10,061 --> 01:08:11,588
Ten.

582
01:08:11,688 --> 01:08:13,047
Nine.

583
01:08:13,147 --> 01:08:14,674
Eight.

584
01:08:14,774 --> 01:08:15,842
Seven.

585
01:08:15,942 --> 01:08:17,218
Six.

586
01:08:17,318 --> 01:08:18,594
Five.

587
01:08:18,694 --> 01:08:20,013
Four.

588
01:08:20,113 --> 01:08:21,347
Three.

589
01:08:21,447 --> 01:08:22,724
Two.

590
01:08:22,824 --> 01:08:24,824
One.

591
01:08:32,625 --> 01:08:34,669
What about us?

592
01:08:35,753 --> 01:08:38,464
What about us?

593
01:08:40,132 --> 01:08:42,760
We are alive...

594
01:08:42,969 --> 01:08:48,391
...and this is a celebration of life.

595
01:08:48,641 --> 01:08:52,019
And this is commitment...

596
01:08:52,311 --> 01:08:57,399
...to a truly human future.

597
01:09:02,655 --> 01:09:05,991
What's your name?
- Hello, Teddy.

598
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,200
Hello, David.

599
01:09:15,542 --> 01:09:16,902
Take it.

600
01:09:17,002 --> 01:09:18,737
Take it.

601
01:09:18,837 --> 01:09:21,824
Biker hounds rolling.
- Cue biker hound.

602
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:25,678
Papa.
- Amanda, go outside. It's smoky here.

603
01:09:25,886 --> 01:09:28,096
There's a boy in the cage.

604
01:09:28,222 --> 01:09:31,458
What did you say?
- There's a boy in the cage.

605
01:09:31,558 --> 01:09:35,187
A boy?
- A real boy. He's stuck in the cage.

606
01:09:35,479 --> 01:09:38,816
In the pen, honey?
- In the jail place.

607
01:09:39,024 --> 01:09:43,095
Crowd reaction....
- We got a remote near the pigpen?

608
01:09:43,195 --> 01:09:46,390
Bring it up. Let me see
what she's talking about.

609
01:09:46,490 --> 01:09:51,420
What are you looking for?
- She says she saw a boy in there.

610
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:58,110
How do you know about this?
- The bear told me.

611
01:09:58,210 --> 01:10:00,210
I told her.

612
01:10:08,929 --> 01:10:13,475
Would you be so kind
and shut down my pain receivers?

613
01:10:20,398 --> 01:10:22,050
Why is this happening?

614
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:25,028
History repeats itself.

615
01:10:25,237 --> 01:10:29,074
It's the rite of blood and electricity.

616
01:10:29,282 --> 01:10:33,144
When the opportunities avail
themselves, they pick away at us...

617
01:10:33,244 --> 01:10:39,194
...cutting back our numbers so they
can maintain numerical superiority.

618
01:10:41,461 --> 01:10:45,548
My time, is it up already?
Goodbye, everyone.

619
01:10:45,757 --> 01:10:49,536
Keep me safe, keep me safe.
- Not yet. They just want him.

620
01:10:49,636 --> 01:10:53,036
Keep me safe, keep me safe,
keep me safe.

621
01:10:53,598 --> 01:10:54,916
Security.

622
01:10:55,016 --> 01:11:00,130
Do you have any reports of any
missing kids, any missing children?

623
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:01,965
All right, thanks.

624
01:11:02,065 --> 01:11:05,985
How'd you get in there? Boy.
You, boy.

625
01:11:07,028 --> 01:11:09,113
What's your name?

626
01:11:09,697 --> 01:11:11,697
I won't bite you.

627
01:11:12,825 --> 01:11:15,375
Come over where I can see you.

628
01:11:20,458 --> 01:11:24,003
I won't hurt you.
I just need to see.

629
01:11:48,402 --> 01:11:51,405
You're a machine.
- I'm a boy.

630
01:11:51,781 --> 01:11:53,781
Is he a toy boy?

631
01:11:53,866 --> 01:11:55,866
My name is David.

632
01:11:57,453 --> 01:11:59,453
Impossible.

633
01:12:00,039 --> 01:12:05,069
I still work, don't I? I can work
in the dark, but my lamp is broken.

634
01:12:05,169 --> 01:12:10,799
My lamplight will not work.
I hit my lamp on a girder overhead.

635
01:12:28,192 --> 01:12:30,736
Goodbye, David.

636
01:12:36,116 --> 01:12:40,938
No one builds children. No one
ever has. What would be the point?

637
01:12:41,038 --> 01:12:45,192
It could be a custom job.
Some rich guy's pretend child.

638
01:12:45,292 --> 01:12:47,292
I'm a custom job.

639
01:12:47,377 --> 01:12:51,882
75 years ago, I was Time magazine's
Mecha of the Year.

640
01:12:52,049 --> 01:12:54,760
No, this work is first-rate.

641
01:12:54,968 --> 01:12:58,931
A lot of love went into him.
David?

642
01:12:59,973 --> 01:13:03,226
You are one of a kind, you know that?

643
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:08,106
Who made you?
- My mommy made me.

644
01:13:08,315 --> 01:13:12,302
One of those built to aspire
to the human condition.

645
01:13:12,402 --> 01:13:16,056
Who is your maker?
Serve U.S., E.Z. Living, Robiville?

646
01:13:16,156 --> 01:13:21,453
Simulit City Center, Cybertronics?
- Monica is my mommy.

647
01:13:21,661 --> 01:13:24,551
Can I speak with you for a moment?

648
01:13:54,444 --> 01:13:56,846
You're thinking about not showing him?

649
01:13:56,946 --> 01:14:00,601
Something this original you don't toss out.

650
01:14:00,617 --> 01:14:03,186
Originality without purpose is useless.

651
01:14:03,286 --> 01:14:08,386
If money is your purpose,
here's your refund. My compliments.

652
01:14:12,462 --> 01:14:15,615
What'll you do with him?
- Put him where he belongs.

653
01:14:15,715 --> 01:14:17,715
In show business.

654
01:14:17,717 --> 01:14:21,967
It was certainly my good fortune,
running into you.

655
01:14:23,348 --> 01:14:25,959
Let go of him. Let go.
- I'm trying.

656
01:14:26,059 --> 01:14:30,646
Don't let go. Keep me safe.
- Suit yourselves.

657
01:14:43,326 --> 01:14:47,330
Johnson-Johnson. Johnson-Johnson.

658
01:14:47,538 --> 01:14:49,707
Johnson-Johnson.

659
01:15:17,067 --> 01:15:19,111
Ladies and gentlemen...

660
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:23,157
...boys and girls and children of all ages.

661
01:15:23,365 --> 01:15:25,868
What will they think of next?

662
01:15:26,452 --> 01:15:27,978
See here.

663
01:15:28,078 --> 01:15:32,875
A bitty-bot, a Tinkertoy,
a living doll.

664
01:15:33,709 --> 01:15:35,945
We all know why they made him.

665
01:15:36,045 --> 01:15:40,049
To steal your hearts,
to replace your children.

666
01:15:40,257 --> 01:15:43,952
This is the latest
of their insults to human dignity.

667
01:15:44,052 --> 01:15:48,727
And in their grand scheme
to phase out God's children...

668
01:15:48,891 --> 01:15:52,206
...meet the next generation of child...

669
01:15:52,227 --> 01:15:54,980
...designed to do just that.

670
01:16:00,444 --> 01:16:02,654
Do not be fooled...

671
01:16:03,530 --> 01:16:06,590
...by the artistry of this creation.

672
01:16:07,409 --> 01:16:10,979
No doubt there was talent in its crafting.

673
01:16:11,330 --> 01:16:16,109
Yet, with the very first strike,
you will see the big lie...

674
01:16:16,209 --> 01:16:19,463
...come apart before your very eyes.

675
01:16:19,671 --> 01:16:23,759
Don't burn me. Don't burn me.
I'm not Pinocchio.

676
01:16:23,967 --> 01:16:27,387
Don't make me die.
I'm David. I'm David.

677
01:16:28,847 --> 01:16:33,752
Mecha don't plead for their lives.
Who is that? He looks like a boy.

678
01:16:33,852 --> 01:16:36,563
Built like a boy to disarm us.

679
01:16:36,813 --> 01:16:40,133
See how they try
to imitate our emotions now.

680
01:16:40,233 --> 01:16:43,845
Whatever performance
this Sim puts on, remember...

681
01:16:43,945 --> 01:16:47,430
...we are only demolishing artificiality.

682
01:16:51,661 --> 01:16:55,331
Let he who is without Sim...

683
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,793
...cast the first stone.

684
01:17:14,726 --> 01:17:16,769
He's just a boy.

685
01:17:16,978 --> 01:17:19,188
Johnson, you're a monster.

686
01:17:30,491 --> 01:17:34,316
Get him out before
they tear this place apart.

687
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:42,104
We found him.
- Where?

688
01:18:42,312 --> 01:18:45,633
A Flesh Fair outside Haddonfield.
- Is he alive?

689
01:18:45,733 --> 01:18:49,403
Yes. He's in one piece.

690
01:19:09,089 --> 01:19:11,089
I see the moon.

691
01:19:16,138 --> 01:19:19,558
Is it real?
- I don't know, David.

692
01:19:20,767 --> 01:19:22,767
Is it coming?

693
01:19:24,187 --> 01:19:26,731
I can't tell yet.

694
01:19:28,483 --> 01:19:31,027
Let's not walk this way.

695
01:19:39,244 --> 01:19:42,049
Where are we going?
- This way now.

696
01:19:42,330 --> 01:19:45,275
Are you in trouble?
Have you run away?

697
01:19:45,375 --> 01:19:48,265
My mommy told me to run away.
- Why?

698
01:19:48,378 --> 01:19:53,174
I guess because Henry didn't like me.
- Why was that?

699
01:19:53,425 --> 01:19:56,145
Martin came home.
- And who is he?

700
01:19:56,261 --> 01:19:59,289
Martin is Mommy and Henry's real son.

701
01:19:59,389 --> 01:20:03,518
After I find the Blue Fairy,
then I can go home.

702
01:20:03,726 --> 01:20:08,965
Mommy will love a real boy.
The Blue Fairy will make me into one.

703
01:20:09,065 --> 01:20:11,885
Is Blue Fairy Mecha, Orga,
man or woman?

704
01:20:11,985 --> 01:20:13,985
Woman.

705
01:20:14,737 --> 01:20:16,737
Woman?

706
01:20:18,449 --> 01:20:20,449
I know women.

707
01:20:23,329 --> 01:20:26,219
They sometimes ask for me by name.

708
01:20:26,374 --> 01:20:31,219
I know all about women.
About as much as there is to know.

709
01:20:31,671 --> 01:20:36,516
No two are ever alike.
And after they've met me, no two...

710
01:20:36,968 --> 01:20:41,080
...are ever the same. And I know
where they can be found.

711
01:20:41,180 --> 01:20:44,684
Where?
- Rouge City.

712
01:20:45,184 --> 01:20:48,421
Across the Delaware.
Too far for our feet.

713
01:20:48,521 --> 01:20:50,986
We'll need help to get there.

714
01:20:53,401 --> 01:20:56,988
And it is not without peril.

715
01:20:57,613 --> 01:20:59,991
We will have to journey...

716
01:21:04,829 --> 01:21:06,829
...towards the moon.

717
01:21:09,208 --> 01:21:12,183
Are there many women in Rouge City?

718
01:21:12,753 --> 01:21:17,550
As there are stars at night.
- How do we find just one?

719
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:20,636
We will ask Dr. Know.

720
01:21:22,138 --> 01:21:24,849
There is nothing he doesn't.

721
01:21:31,939 --> 01:21:34,550
Exactly what name
do you give this woman?

722
01:21:34,650 --> 01:21:37,403
She is just Blue Fairy.

723
01:21:37,611 --> 01:21:39,822
Blue Fairy.

724
01:21:40,072 --> 01:21:43,601
In the world of Orga,
blue is the color of melancholy.

725
01:21:43,701 --> 01:21:48,230
Yet the services I provide will put
a blush back on anyone's cheek.

726
01:21:48,330 --> 01:21:52,985
I will change the color of your fairy
for you. She will scream out:

727
01:21:53,085 --> 01:21:58,048
'Oh, yes. Oh, God.
Oh, yes. Oh, God. Oh, God.'

728
01:21:58,257 --> 01:22:01,577
She'll make you a real boy,
I'll make her a real woman...

729
01:22:01,677 --> 01:22:03,495
...and all will be right...

730
01:22:03,595 --> 01:22:07,291
...because you held my hand
and saved my brain...

731
01:22:07,391 --> 01:22:10,961
...so that once again my customers
may ask for me by name:

732
01:22:11,061 --> 01:22:13,855
'Gigolo Joe, what do you know?'

733
01:22:15,107 --> 01:22:17,192
Why do you do that?

734
01:22:17,401 --> 01:22:19,401
That's just what I do.

735
01:22:20,404 --> 01:22:24,641
Now follow me and don't fall behind.
All roads lead to Rouge.

736
01:22:24,741 --> 01:22:28,495
Don't they say that, hey?
Don't they just?

737
01:22:40,757 --> 01:22:42,909
There are girls just like me.

738
01:22:43,009 --> 01:22:46,580
We are the guiltless pleasures
of the lonely human.

739
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:49,916
You won't get us pregnant
or have us to supper.

740
01:22:50,016 --> 01:22:53,587
We work under you, we work on you
and we work for you.

741
01:22:53,687 --> 01:22:58,383
Man made us better at what we do
than was ever humanly possible.

742
01:22:58,483 --> 01:23:03,697
If you could manage us a lift
to Rouge City, all this...

743
01:23:08,868 --> 01:23:12,455
...and much, much more...

744
01:23:12,664 --> 01:23:14,664
...can be yours.

745
01:23:15,625 --> 01:23:17,625
Get in.

746
01:23:32,392 --> 01:23:34,392
Say 'ah.'

747
01:23:57,708 --> 01:24:00,111
Over there is Here Kitty Kitty...

748
01:24:00,211 --> 01:24:04,886
...where the agency held my tryouts
when I was made new.

749
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:11,414
That's Tails. Very hoity-toity.
I've yet to be asked to perform there.

750
01:24:11,514 --> 01:24:15,835
Only sunrise gents and sunset ladies.
Sierra Class robots.

751
01:24:15,935 --> 01:24:19,255
Can't even speak English.
All made in Sweden.

752
01:24:19,355 --> 01:24:22,400
Couldn't tell a joke from a poke.

753
01:24:29,073 --> 01:24:33,702
There's Mildred.
I have to show you inside Mildred.

754
01:24:51,011 --> 01:24:53,011
Are you her?

755
01:24:54,181 --> 01:24:57,768
That's Our Lady of the Immaculate Heart.

756
01:25:00,437 --> 01:25:03,298
Those who made us look
for those who made them.

757
01:25:03,398 --> 01:25:06,343
They go in, fold their hands,
sing songs...

758
01:25:06,443 --> 01:25:09,805
...and when they come out,
it's me they find.

759
01:25:09,905 --> 01:25:13,730
I've picked up a lot
of business on this spot.

760
01:25:16,912 --> 01:25:19,377
But, Joe, where's Blue Fairy?

761
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:24,535
That's what we'll find out
when we ask Dr. Know.

762
01:25:25,879 --> 01:25:29,619
That's where everyone goes
who needs to know.

763
01:25:30,842 --> 01:25:33,720
Meet the good doctor.

764
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:19,140
Starving minds,
welcome to Dr. Know...

765
01:26:19,390 --> 01:26:22,460
...where fast food for thought
is served all day...

766
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:25,255
...in 40,000 locations nationwide.

767
01:26:25,355 --> 01:26:28,500
Ask Dr. Know.
There's nothing I don't.

768
01:26:28,566 --> 01:26:31,511
Tell me where I can find the Blue Fairy.

769
01:26:31,611 --> 01:26:36,516
Question me, you pay the fee.
Two for five, you get one free.

770
01:26:36,616 --> 01:26:41,938
Two questions cost five Newbucks
with a third question on the house.

771
01:26:42,038 --> 01:26:47,085
In this day and age,
nothing costs more than information.

772
01:26:49,462 --> 01:26:52,532
That's it.
- Ten Newbucks and a 10 copper...

773
01:26:52,632 --> 01:26:55,012
...comes to seven questions.

774
01:26:55,093 --> 01:26:57,093
That should be enough.

775
01:26:57,303 --> 01:26:58,830
He's a smooth operator.

776
01:26:58,930 --> 01:27:03,017
He'll press our limits,
but try we must.

777
01:27:11,567 --> 01:27:14,053
Greetings.
On offer, fact or fiction.

778
01:27:14,153 --> 01:27:17,056
Literacy range from primal to postdoctoral.

779
01:27:17,156 --> 01:27:21,143
From fairy tale to religious.
Who's who or where's where.

780
01:27:21,243 --> 01:27:23,371
Or flat fact.

781
01:27:23,996 --> 01:27:26,857
Flat fact?
- Thank you for question one.

782
01:27:26,957 --> 01:27:29,235
A term demanding an equal answer....

783
01:27:29,335 --> 01:27:33,160
That shouldn't count.
That wasn't my question.

784
01:27:33,297 --> 01:27:38,344
You must not raise your voice up
at the end of the sentence.

785
01:27:38,969 --> 01:27:43,057
Flat fact.
- You have six more questions.

786
01:27:43,265 --> 01:27:47,394
Where is Blue Fairy?

787
01:27:47,603 --> 01:27:50,506
In the garden.
Vascostylis Blue Fairy.

788
01:27:50,606 --> 01:27:54,093
Blooms twice annually
with bright, blue flowers.

789
01:27:54,193 --> 01:27:58,305
A hybrid between Ascola meda
Arnold. Five more questions.

790
01:27:58,405 --> 01:28:00,783
Who is Blue Fairy?

791
01:28:01,033 --> 01:28:04,269
Are you sad, lonely,
looking for a friend?

792
01:28:04,369 --> 01:28:07,564
Blue Fairy Escort Service
will find a mate for you.

793
01:28:07,664 --> 01:28:09,733
You have four more questions.

794
01:28:09,833 --> 01:28:11,833
Joe.

795
01:28:12,461 --> 01:28:14,588
Try 'fairy tale.'

796
01:28:16,089 --> 01:28:18,089
New category.

797
01:28:21,220 --> 01:28:23,220
A fairy's tale.

798
01:28:23,263 --> 01:28:25,557
No. Fairy tale.

799
01:28:25,849 --> 01:28:28,226
No. Fairy tale.

800
01:28:32,731 --> 01:28:34,549
What is Blue Fairy?

801
01:28:34,649 --> 01:28:37,819
Pinocchio, by Carlo Collodi.

802
01:28:38,028 --> 01:28:41,938
'There was a rustling
as a flapping of wings...

803
01:28:41,948 --> 01:28:45,263
...and a falcon flew to the windowsill.

804
01:28:45,285 --> 01:28:47,729
'What are your orders,
beautiful fairy?' '

805
01:28:47,829 --> 01:28:49,829
That's her.

806
01:28:49,915 --> 01:28:52,567
'You know that the child with blue hair...

807
01:28:52,667 --> 01:28:54,986
...was the good-hearted fairy...

808
01:28:55,086 --> 01:28:59,846
...who had lived in that wood
for more than a thousand--'

809
01:29:00,091 --> 01:29:01,368
That's her.

810
01:29:01,468 --> 01:29:04,871
It was an example of her.
But we're getting closer.

811
01:29:04,971 --> 01:29:09,476
But if a fairy tale is real,
then wouldn't it be fact?

812
01:29:09,643 --> 01:29:11,643
A flat fact?

813
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:14,520
Say no more.

814
01:29:17,525 --> 01:29:19,525
New category, please.

815
01:29:21,154 --> 01:29:23,154
Combine...

816
01:29:24,783 --> 01:29:27,952
...fact with...

817
01:29:31,122 --> 01:29:33,122
...fairy tale.

818
01:29:37,462 --> 01:29:39,462
Now...

819
01:29:39,589 --> 01:29:41,589
...ask him again.

820
01:29:49,682 --> 01:29:51,682
How...

821
01:29:51,934 --> 01:29:54,479
...can the Blue Fairy...

822
01:29:55,688 --> 01:29:57,688
...make...

823
01:29:58,691 --> 01:30:00,691
...a robot...

824
01:30:01,235 --> 01:30:04,489
...into a real, live boy?

825
01:30:09,827 --> 01:30:13,731
Come away O human child
To the waters and the wild

826
01:30:13,831 --> 01:30:15,608
With a fairy hand in hand

827
01:30:15,708 --> 01:30:19,820
For the world's more full of weeping
Than you can understand

828
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:23,991
Your quest will be perilous,
yet the reward is beyond price.

829
01:30:24,091 --> 01:30:27,370
In his book,
How Can a Robot Become Human?...

830
01:30:27,470 --> 01:30:33,084
...Professor Allen Hobby writes of
that which transforms Mecha into Orga.

831
01:30:33,184 --> 01:30:35,184
How do I find her?

832
01:30:35,186 --> 01:30:37,730
Discovery is quite possible.

833
01:30:37,938 --> 01:30:42,676
Our Blue Fairy does exist in
one place and in one place only.

834
01:30:42,776 --> 01:30:45,971
At the end of the world
where the lions weep.

835
01:30:46,071 --> 01:30:49,200
Here is the place dreams are born.

836
01:30:50,242 --> 01:30:55,767
Many a Mecha has gone to the end
of the world, never to come back.

837
01:30:55,914 --> 01:31:00,589
That is why they call
the end of the world 'Man-hattan.'

838
01:31:00,711 --> 01:31:03,714
And that's why we must go there.

839
01:31:07,718 --> 01:31:09,718
Wait.

840
01:31:10,512 --> 01:31:13,997
What if the Blue Fairy isn't real at all?

841
01:31:15,934 --> 01:31:19,671
What if she's magic?
The supernatural unites the universe.

842
01:31:19,771 --> 01:31:24,635
Only Orga believe what cannot be seen.
It's what separates our species.

843
01:31:24,735 --> 01:31:28,071
What if she's an electronic parasite...

844
01:31:28,363 --> 01:31:31,678
...that haunts artificial intelligence?

845
01:31:33,243 --> 01:31:38,290
They hate us, you know. The humans.
They'll stop at nothing.

846
01:31:39,416 --> 01:31:41,793
My mommy doesn't hate me.

847
01:31:42,044 --> 01:31:45,172
Because I'm special and unique.

848
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:48,700
Because there's never been anyone
like me before, ever.

849
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:50,844
When I am real...

850
01:31:51,052 --> 01:31:54,748
...Mommy will read to me
and tuck me in my bed...

851
01:31:54,848 --> 01:31:57,542
...and listen to me and cuddle with me...

852
01:31:57,642 --> 01:32:02,062
...and tell me every day 100 times
that she loves me.

853
01:32:03,732 --> 01:32:06,452
She loves what you do for her...

854
01:32:07,152 --> 01:32:11,232
...as my customers love
what it is I do for them.

855
01:32:14,617 --> 01:32:19,956
But she does not love you, David.
She cannot love you.

856
01:32:20,165 --> 01:32:25,528
You are neither flesh nor blood. You
are not a dog or a cat or a canary.

857
01:32:25,628 --> 01:32:30,388
You were designed and built specific
like the rest of us.

858
01:32:30,550 --> 01:32:34,120
You are alone now
because they tired of you...

859
01:32:34,220 --> 01:32:36,220
...or replaced you...

860
01:32:36,347 --> 01:32:40,937
...or were displeased with
something you said or broke.

861
01:32:41,978 --> 01:32:46,608
They made us too smart,
too quick and too many.

862
01:32:47,108 --> 01:32:50,595
We suffer for their mistakes
because when the end comes...

863
01:32:50,695 --> 01:32:53,906
...all that will be left is us.

864
01:32:54,115 --> 01:32:59,328
That's why they hate us.
And that's why you must stay here.

865
01:32:59,579 --> 01:33:01,579
With me.

866
01:33:03,875 --> 01:33:06,002
Goodbye, Joe.

867
01:33:27,815 --> 01:33:29,815
Stay back. Stay back.

868
01:33:30,026 --> 01:33:33,029
Let's clear this doorway, please.

869
01:33:33,738 --> 01:33:36,282
You're in bad trouble.

870
01:33:49,378 --> 01:33:53,924
Go about your business now.
Let's go. Move it.

871
01:34:07,021 --> 01:34:10,166
Be careful, David. This is not a toy.

872
01:34:44,349 --> 01:34:47,602
Destination?
- Man-hattan.

873
01:35:31,730 --> 01:35:34,524
Mecha-restricted area.

874
01:35:50,748 --> 01:35:53,109
Man-hattan.
- Destination achieved.

875
01:35:53,209 --> 01:35:57,289
The lost city in the sea
at the end of the world.

876
01:35:59,048 --> 01:36:01,509
'Where the lions weep.'

877
01:36:25,575 --> 01:36:27,575
Turn around, Joe.

878
01:36:28,327 --> 01:36:30,871
We're not gonna give up yet.

879
01:36:31,372 --> 01:36:34,432
Turn around.
Turn all the way around.

880
01:37:45,487 --> 01:37:47,487
Professor Hobby?

881
01:37:50,617 --> 01:37:52,703
Professor Hobby?

882
01:38:06,883 --> 01:38:10,370
Come away O human child
To the waters and the wild

883
01:38:10,470 --> 01:38:12,597
With a fairy hand in hand

884
01:38:12,806 --> 01:38:18,645
For the world's more full of weeping
Than you can understand

885
01:38:44,379 --> 01:38:46,379
Professor Hobby?

886
01:38:48,842 --> 01:38:50,842
Professor Hobby?

887
01:38:51,886 --> 01:38:53,886
Hello?

888
01:38:56,015 --> 01:38:58,015
Hello.

889
01:39:04,023 --> 01:39:07,168
Is this the place they make you real?

890
01:39:09,028 --> 01:39:12,173
This is the place they make you read.

891
01:39:16,577 --> 01:39:18,577
Are you real?

892
01:39:20,414 --> 01:39:22,414
I guess.

893
01:39:30,258 --> 01:39:32,258
Are you me?

894
01:39:32,635 --> 01:39:34,845
I'm David.
- You're not.

895
01:39:35,263 --> 01:39:38,057
Yes, I am. I'm David.

896
01:39:39,934 --> 01:39:41,934
So am I.

897
01:39:42,103 --> 01:39:44,103
Hello, David.

898
01:39:49,985 --> 01:39:51,985
Can you read?

899
01:39:52,947 --> 01:39:56,432
Can you sit down
and we can read together?

900
01:39:57,993 --> 01:39:59,993
Let's be friends.

901
01:40:00,996 --> 01:40:02,996
You can't have her.

902
01:40:03,916 --> 01:40:05,916
I can't hear you.

903
01:40:07,711 --> 01:40:12,091
She's mine. And I'm the only one.

904
01:40:15,052 --> 01:40:18,430
I'm David. I'm David. I'm David.

905
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:28,440
I'm special. I'm unique. I'm David.

906
01:40:28,649 --> 01:40:30,776
You can't have her.

907
01:40:40,994 --> 01:40:43,121
Yes, you are David.

908
01:40:45,707 --> 01:40:47,707
Professor Hobby?

909
01:40:48,168 --> 01:40:51,313
Yes, David.
I've been waiting for you.

910
01:40:56,009 --> 01:41:00,599
Dr. Know told me you'd be here.
Is Blue Fairy here too?

911
01:41:01,473 --> 01:41:05,310
I first heard of your Blue Fairy from Monica.

912
01:41:06,061 --> 01:41:10,173
What could the Blue Fairy do for you?
- Make me a real boy.

913
01:41:10,273 --> 01:41:12,484
But you are a real boy.

914
01:41:14,694 --> 01:41:19,724
As real as I've ever made,
which would make me your Blue Fairy.

915
01:41:19,824 --> 01:41:25,021
You're not her. Dr. Know said she'd
be at the lost city in the sea--

916
01:41:25,121 --> 01:41:30,646
That's what Dr. Know needed to know
to get you to come home to us.

917
01:41:31,169 --> 01:41:34,506
And it's the only time we intervened.

918
01:41:34,756 --> 01:41:38,093
The only help that we gave him...

919
01:41:39,386 --> 01:41:41,429
...to give to you...

920
01:41:46,309 --> 01:41:49,794
...so you could find your way home to us.

921
01:41:50,939 --> 01:41:53,466
Until you, robots didn't dream...

922
01:41:53,566 --> 01:41:58,326
...robots didn't desire
unless we told them what to want.

923
01:41:58,488 --> 01:42:03,163
Do you have any idea
what a success story you've become?

924
01:42:03,243 --> 01:42:07,605
You found a fairy tale, and inspired
by love, fueled by desire...

925
01:42:07,705 --> 01:42:09,983
...you set out to make her real.

926
01:42:10,083 --> 01:42:14,862
Most remarkable of all, no one taught
you how. We lost you for a while.

927
01:42:14,962 --> 01:42:18,633
When you were found,
we had a simple test.

928
01:42:18,925 --> 01:42:22,453
Where would your self-motivated
reasoning take you?

929
01:42:22,553 --> 01:42:25,103
To conclude that Blue Fairy...

930
01:42:25,223 --> 01:42:28,626
...is a human flaw, to wish
for things that don't exist...

931
01:42:28,726 --> 01:42:31,701
...or to the greatest human gift...

932
01:42:31,854 --> 01:42:34,966
...the ability to chase down our dreams?

933
01:42:35,066 --> 01:42:39,862
And that is something no machine
has ever done until you.

934
01:42:42,198 --> 01:42:45,284
I thought I was one of a kind.

935
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:50,831
My son was one of a kind.

936
01:42:53,626 --> 01:42:56,545
You are the first of a kind.

937
01:43:09,975 --> 01:43:13,145
My brain is falling out.

938
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:19,609
Would you like to meet
your real mothers and fathers?

939
01:43:20,486 --> 01:43:23,656
The team is anxious to talk to you.

940
01:43:24,657 --> 01:43:28,952
I want you to wait here.
I'll gather them up.

941
01:43:31,121 --> 01:43:35,201
We want to hear everything
about your adventures.

942
01:43:35,751 --> 01:43:38,128
We want to thank you...

943
01:43:39,505 --> 01:43:43,330
...and tell you what's in store for you next.

944
01:47:23,560 --> 01:47:25,560
Mommy.

945
01:49:27,850 --> 01:49:30,769
I saw it, Joe. I saw it.

946
01:49:30,978 --> 01:49:34,633
The place where she lives.
She's down there.

947
01:49:34,732 --> 01:49:38,472
She is?
- She's waiting for me. We have to go.

948
01:49:46,785 --> 01:49:52,735
When you become a real boy, remember
me to the ladies when you grow up.

949
01:49:53,375 --> 01:49:55,840
Goodbye, Joe.
- Goodbye, David.

950
01:50:00,632 --> 01:50:02,632
I am.

951
01:50:04,720 --> 01:50:06,763
I was.

952
01:50:48,805 --> 01:50:52,308
David, please be careful.

953
01:53:11,405 --> 01:53:14,975
The Blue Fairy's all right.
- What happened?

954
01:53:15,492 --> 01:53:19,413
I don't know.
- We are in a cage.

955
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:33,800
Blue Fairy?

956
01:53:36,054 --> 01:53:38,054
Please.

957
01:53:39,266 --> 01:53:44,229
Please, please, make me
into a real, live boy.

958
01:53:47,065 --> 01:53:49,065
Please.

959
01:53:51,736 --> 01:53:53,736
Blue Fairy?

960
01:53:56,199 --> 01:53:58,199
Please.

961
01:53:58,243 --> 01:54:00,243
Please...

962
01:54:00,620 --> 01:54:03,248
...make me real.

963
01:54:05,250 --> 01:54:08,920
Blue Fairy, please.

964
01:54:10,922 --> 01:54:14,342
Please make me real.

965
01:54:19,389 --> 01:54:22,100
Please make me a real boy.

966
01:54:24,102 --> 01:54:26,229
Please, Blue Fairy.

967
01:54:27,939 --> 01:54:31,025
Make me into a real boy.

968
01:54:32,276 --> 01:54:34,012
Please....

969
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:37,599
And David continued to pray
to the Blue Fairy...

970
01:54:37,699 --> 01:54:41,369
...she who smiled softly forever.

971
01:54:41,577 --> 01:54:44,622
She who welcomed forever.

972
01:54:44,831 --> 01:54:46,899
Eventually, the floodlights died...

973
01:54:46,999 --> 01:54:50,194
...but David could still see her,
palely, by day.

974
01:54:50,294 --> 01:54:53,354
And he still addressed her, in hope.

975
01:54:53,631 --> 01:54:58,369
He prayed until all the sea anemones
had shriveled and died...

976
01:54:58,469 --> 01:55:00,163
...as the ocean froze...

977
01:55:00,263 --> 01:55:04,500
...and the ice encased the amphibicopter
and the Blue Fairy...

978
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:07,837
...locking them together
where he could see her...

979
01:55:07,937 --> 01:55:10,147
...a blue ghost in ice.

980
01:55:10,398 --> 01:55:12,398
Always there.

981
01:55:12,775 --> 01:55:14,775
Always smiling.

982
01:55:15,152 --> 01:55:17,279
Always awaiting him.

983
01:55:17,780 --> 01:55:20,391
Eventually, he never moved at all...

984
01:55:20,491 --> 01:55:23,911
...but his eyes always stayed open...

985
01:55:24,161 --> 01:55:28,941
...staring ahead forever all through
the darkness of each night...

986
01:55:29,041 --> 01:55:31,418
...and the next day...

987
01:55:32,503 --> 01:55:34,880
...and the next day....

988
01:55:35,881 --> 01:55:40,928
Thus, 2000 years passed by.

989
02:02:18,071 --> 02:02:20,532
Teddy, we're home.

990
02:02:26,705 --> 02:02:28,705
Mommy?

991
02:02:41,511 --> 02:02:43,511
Mommy.

992
02:02:50,937 --> 02:02:53,231
We're home.

993
02:03:05,827 --> 02:03:08,371
Where are you?

994
02:03:09,831 --> 02:03:12,042
David.

995
02:03:14,586 --> 02:03:18,173
David.

996
02:03:42,488 --> 02:03:46,409
You have been searching for me,
haven't you?

997
02:03:50,872 --> 02:03:54,625
For my whole life.

998
02:03:55,835 --> 02:04:00,425
And what, after all this time,
have you come to ask me?

999
02:04:00,548 --> 02:04:05,011
I have a wish to make.
- And what is your wish?

1000
02:04:07,013 --> 02:04:09,640
Please make me a real boy...

1001
02:04:09,849 --> 02:04:14,269
...so my mommy will love me
and let me stay with her.

1002
02:04:14,645 --> 02:04:19,108
David, I will do anything that is possible...

1003
02:04:19,317 --> 02:04:22,653
...but I cannot make you a real boy.

1004
02:04:24,071 --> 02:04:26,071
Where am I?

1005
02:04:28,117 --> 02:04:31,942
This looks like my house,
but it is different.

1006
02:04:31,954 --> 02:04:37,334
Yes, it is different.
But it's also your home.

1007
02:04:37,543 --> 02:04:41,213
We read your mind and it's all here.

1008
02:04:41,422 --> 02:04:47,032
There's nothing too small that
you didn't store for us to remember.

1009
02:04:47,845 --> 02:04:50,931
We so want you to be happy.

1010
02:04:51,140 --> 02:04:54,030
You are so important to us, David.

1011
02:04:54,059 --> 02:04:57,813
You are unique in all the world.

1012
02:05:02,526 --> 02:05:05,487
Will Mommy be coming home soon?

1013
02:05:07,489 --> 02:05:10,549
Is she out shopping with Martin now?

1014
02:05:12,327 --> 02:05:16,457
David, she can never come home...

1015
02:05:17,124 --> 02:05:20,711
...because 2000 years have passed...

1016
02:05:20,961 --> 02:05:23,797
...and she is no longer living.

1017
02:05:26,049 --> 02:05:30,679
Dearest David,
when you are lonely...

1018
02:05:30,929 --> 02:05:36,435
...we can bring back other people
from your time in the past.

1019
02:05:36,935 --> 02:05:40,080
If you can bring back other people...

1020
02:05:40,314 --> 02:05:43,233
...why can't you bring back her?.

1021
02:05:44,109 --> 02:05:49,634
We can only bring back people
whose bodies we dig up from the ice.

1022
02:05:49,990 --> 02:05:54,161
We need some physical sample
of the person...

1023
02:05:54,369 --> 02:05:57,539
...like a bone or a fingernail.

1024
02:05:57,747 --> 02:05:59,747
David.

1025
02:06:00,417 --> 02:06:02,417
Yes, Teddy?

1026
02:06:02,919 --> 02:06:07,084
Do you remember when you cut
some of Mommy's hair?

1027
02:06:07,632 --> 02:06:09,632
Henry shook me.

1028
02:06:10,051 --> 02:06:13,305
And you dropped her hair?

1029
02:06:15,348 --> 02:06:17,348
I know.

1030
02:06:43,126 --> 02:06:46,629
Now you can bring her back...

1031
02:06:47,839 --> 02:06:49,839
...can't you?

1032
02:06:52,969 --> 02:06:55,930
Give him what he wants.

1033
02:07:02,228 --> 02:07:07,442
Dearest David,
your wish is my command.

1034
02:07:30,339 --> 02:07:32,634
Hey, Joe, what do you know?

1035
02:08:17,010 --> 02:08:20,205
I often felt a sort of envy of humans...

1036
02:08:20,305 --> 02:08:23,365
...of that thing they called spirit.

1037
02:08:23,434 --> 02:08:27,796
Humans created a million explanations
of the meaning of life...

1038
02:08:27,896 --> 02:08:30,591
...in art, poetry,
mathematical formulas.

1039
02:08:30,691 --> 02:08:35,012
Certainly they must be the key
to the meaning of existence.

1040
02:08:35,112 --> 02:08:38,087
But human beings no longer existed.

1041
02:08:38,282 --> 02:08:41,076
So we began a project...

1042
02:08:41,285 --> 02:08:45,314
...that would make it possible
to re-create a person, long dead...

1043
02:08:45,414 --> 02:08:49,776
...from the DNA in a fragment
of bone or mummified skin.

1044
02:08:49,876 --> 02:08:52,529
We also wondered,
would it be possible...

1045
02:08:52,629 --> 02:08:56,783
...to retrieve a memory trace
in resonance with a re-created body?

1046
02:08:56,883 --> 02:08:59,178
And you know what we found?

1047
02:08:59,594 --> 02:09:03,589
We found the very fabric
of space-time itself...

1048
02:09:03,765 --> 02:09:07,085
...stored information about every event...

1049
02:09:07,185 --> 02:09:10,500
...which had ever occurred in the past.

1050
02:09:11,022 --> 02:09:15,193
But the experiment was a failure.

1051
02:09:15,569 --> 02:09:21,266
Those who were resurrected only lived
through one day of renewed life.

1052
02:09:21,366 --> 02:09:25,604
When they fell asleep on the night
of their first new day...

1053
02:09:25,704 --> 02:09:27,704
...they died again.

1054
02:09:27,997 --> 02:09:31,985
When they became unconscious,
their very existence...

1055
02:09:32,085 --> 02:09:34,629
...faded away into darkness.

1056
02:09:34,879 --> 02:09:38,024
So you see,
the equations had shown...

1057
02:09:38,216 --> 02:09:42,662
...that once an individual space-time
pathway had been used...

1058
02:09:42,762 --> 02:09:45,515
...it could not be reused.

1059
02:09:46,182 --> 02:09:49,519
If we bring your mother back now...

1060
02:09:49,727 --> 02:09:52,422
...it will only be for one day...

1061
02:09:52,522 --> 02:09:56,109
...and then you will never see her again.

1062
02:09:57,694 --> 02:09:59,694
Maybe....

1063
02:10:02,699 --> 02:10:05,493
Maybe she will be special.

1064
02:10:06,661 --> 02:10:09,288
Maybe she will stay.

1065
02:10:09,622 --> 02:10:12,859
I thought this would be hard
for you to understand.

1066
02:10:12,959 --> 02:10:16,087
You were created to be so young.

1067
02:10:17,296 --> 02:10:22,760
Maybe the one day will be like
that day inside the amphibicopter.

1068
02:10:23,010 --> 02:10:25,888
Maybe it will last forever.

1069
02:10:26,305 --> 02:10:29,642
David, you are the enduring memory...

1070
02:10:29,892 --> 02:10:31,978
...of the human race.

1071
02:10:33,646 --> 02:10:36,983
The most lasting proof of their genius.

1072
02:10:37,191 --> 02:10:41,237
We only want for your happiness.

1073
02:10:41,821 --> 02:10:43,821
David...

1074
02:10:43,906 --> 02:10:46,626
...you've had so little of that.

1075
02:10:47,326 --> 02:10:50,454
If you want for my happiness...

1076
02:10:51,622 --> 02:10:54,792
...then you know what you have to do.

1077
02:10:59,964 --> 02:11:01,964
Listen.

1078
02:11:03,008 --> 02:11:05,010
Can you hear that?

1079
02:11:10,015 --> 02:11:12,893
The new morning has come.

1080
02:11:20,776 --> 02:11:23,153
Go to her, David.

1081
02:11:25,864 --> 02:11:28,951
She's just waking up this instant.

1082
02:13:07,757 --> 02:13:09,884
I found you.

1083
02:13:20,603 --> 02:13:23,314
I must have dozed off.

1084
02:13:25,608 --> 02:13:28,923
How long--?
- Would you like some coffee?

1085
02:13:28,986 --> 02:13:31,113
Just the way you like it?

1086
02:13:32,240 --> 02:13:34,951
Yeah, I'd love a coffee.

1087
02:13:36,369 --> 02:13:38,579
It'll wake me up.

1088
02:14:03,354 --> 02:14:06,232
You never forget how, do you?

1089
02:14:07,733 --> 02:14:09,733
No.

1090
02:14:11,070 --> 02:14:13,070
I never forget.

1091
02:14:18,410 --> 02:14:20,954
I must be a little confused.

1092
02:14:22,081 --> 02:14:24,081
What day is it?

1093
02:14:26,668 --> 02:14:29,797
It is...today.

1094
02:14:31,632 --> 02:14:36,704
As the day wore on, David thought
it was the happiest day of his life.

1095
02:14:36,804 --> 02:14:42,042
All the problems seemed to have
disappeared from his mommy's mind.

1096
02:14:42,142 --> 02:14:45,979
There was no Henry,
there was no Martin.

1097
02:14:46,230 --> 02:14:50,400
There was no grief.
There was only David.

1098
02:15:00,869 --> 02:15:03,480
David was told not to explain anything...

1099
02:15:03,580 --> 02:15:07,484
...or she'd be frightened
and everything would be spoiled.

1100
02:15:07,584 --> 02:15:10,445
But David's journey home belonged to him.

1101
02:15:10,545 --> 02:15:16,325
So he didn't see the harm of painting
things she'd have no memory of.

1102
02:15:43,119 --> 02:15:46,982
David had never had a birthday
because he'd never been born.

1103
02:15:47,082 --> 02:15:50,227
So they baked a cake and lit candles.

1104
02:15:50,376 --> 02:15:54,506
Now make a wish.
- It came true already.

1105
02:16:00,386 --> 02:16:03,248
By now, the windows
were beginning to dim.

1106
02:16:03,348 --> 02:16:08,478
David drew the shades without
even needing to be asked.

1107
02:16:16,903 --> 02:16:20,156
I really ought to be tucking you in.

1108
02:16:20,865 --> 02:16:22,865
How strange.

1109
02:16:27,163 --> 02:16:29,290
How fascinating.

1110
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:37,256
I can hardly keep my eyes open.

1111
02:16:37,798 --> 02:16:40,603
I don't know what's come over me.

1112
02:16:46,223 --> 02:16:49,018
Such a beautiful day.

1113
02:16:51,729 --> 02:16:53,856
I love you, David.

1114
02:17:00,029 --> 02:17:02,239
I do love you.

1115
02:17:03,866 --> 02:17:07,536
I have always loved you.

1116
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:15,715
That was the everlasting moment
he had been waiting for.

1117
02:17:16,962 --> 02:17:22,259
And the moment had passed,
for Monica was sound asleep.

1118
02:17:23,260 --> 02:17:26,263
More than merely asleep.

1119
02:17:27,097 --> 02:17:30,667
Should he shake her,
she would never rouse.

1120
02:17:34,313 --> 02:17:37,232
So David went to sleep too.

1121
02:17:38,192 --> 02:17:42,738
And for the first time in his life...

1122
02:17:43,447 --> 02:17:46,200
...he went to that place...

1123
02:17:46,742 --> 02:17:50,579
...where dreams are born.
