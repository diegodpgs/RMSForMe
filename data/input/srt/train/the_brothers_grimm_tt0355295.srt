1
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,690
Mama, it's so cold.

2
00:00:36,725 --> 00:00:42,095
It's very, very cold, Will.
Put another log on the fire, lad.

3
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,967
There isn't any more firewood, Mama.

4
00:00:47,828 --> 00:00:50,854
Don't worry, Ma.
Jake'll be back soon.

5
00:00:50,889 --> 00:00:53,398
He'll have money for a doctor.

6
00:01:01,268 --> 00:01:03,761
- Did you sell the cow?
- You'll never believe it.

7
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:07,857
- How much did you get?
- I met a stranger on the road.

8
00:01:07,892 --> 00:01:09,595
Beans?

9
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,215
Magic beans.

10
00:01:11,252 --> 00:01:13,812
- Oh, Jacob.
- Beans?!

11
00:01:13,813 --> 00:01:17,579
He said that they'd make Lotte better
and we'd live happily ever after.

12
00:01:17,614 --> 00:01:21,638
And you believed it? You believed it?!
You idiot! You idiot, Jake!

13
00:01:21,673 --> 00:01:25,663
- She's gonna die because of you!
- Boys, think of your poor sister!

14
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:12,209
<i>Arrêtez!</i>

15
00:02:12,212 --> 00:02:14,578
Where do you come from, mein Herr?

16
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,048
Kassel, near Frankfurt.

17
00:02:18,324 --> 00:02:21,293
Monsieur, we're looking
for food and lodging.

18
00:02:23,636 --> 00:02:25,228
<i>Passez. </i>

19
00:02:25,236 --> 00:02:27,185
<i>Merci à vous. </i>

20
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,381
<i>Au revoir. Monsieur. </i>

21
00:02:38,388 --> 00:02:43,451
A little something, sir?
Help an old soldier. Help an old soldier, sir.

22
00:02:43,486 --> 00:02:45,783
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, sir.

23
00:02:45,818 --> 00:02:48,081
God bless you, sir.
God bless you.

24
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,245
Ah!

25
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,023
Oh, God bless you.

26
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,301
- Groom your horses for half a franc.
- Do you know the mayor of this town?

27
00:02:58,336 --> 00:03:00,219
Only groom for the best, sir.

28
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:03,075
Then give him this.

29
00:03:05,972 --> 00:03:08,295
The Brothers Grimm?

30
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,577
Every second counts.

31
00:03:10,612 --> 00:03:16,312
The witch comes in the dead
of night, when the moon is well-hid.

32
00:03:16,347 --> 00:03:21,381
She comes out of
the darkest, coldest blackness.

33
00:03:25,652 --> 00:03:29,850
Her cry would freeze
the very blood in your veins.

34
00:03:29,885 --> 00:03:32,239
You were right to send for us.

35
00:03:33,268 --> 00:03:37,105
- How many here have seen her?
- Everyone who lives by the mill stream.

36
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:42,908
It was a hundred years ago. The miller's
wife was burned at the stake for witchcraft,

37
00:03:42,943 --> 00:03:45,265
and they tossed her charred bones
into the river.

38
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,401
Her remains should have been
sealed in a mirror-lined box.

39
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:54,306
Well, for nights thereafter children saw her
walk the riverbank, beckoning them to her.

40
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:58,232
- Many did. The mill witch of Karlstadt.
- Yes. We know the legend.

41
00:03:58,267 --> 00:04:02,124
- Then you believe us?
- I'd believe anything you choose to tell me.

42
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,329
Come to my mill.
Such ungodly horrors!

43
00:04:05,364 --> 00:04:09,323
Such banshees screeching.
And if you dare set eyes upon...

44
00:04:09,358 --> 00:04:11,377
Shut up!
Give him his medicine.

45
00:04:11,412 --> 00:04:14,540
Brothers Grimm, we're at our wit's end.

46
00:04:14,575 --> 00:04:17,023
What can you do for us?

47
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:19,409
It's difficult. Jake?

48
00:04:19,444 --> 00:04:22,385
When you burn a witch,
her soul burns eternally,

49
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,754
so the exorcism of witches
requires a very special method.

50
00:04:27,252 --> 00:04:29,809
- And expensive.
- Only an arrow of innocent tears,

51
00:04:29,844 --> 00:04:33,871
that is child's tears, shot directly
through the heart can put out that fire.

52
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:38,065
That's the theory.
This is no ordinary witch.

53
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,594
But we've got no one else to turn to.
Can't you help us?

54
00:04:50,516 --> 00:04:53,212
How much?

55
00:04:58,804 --> 00:05:01,568
- You're doing the right thing.
- I hope so.

56
00:05:28,532 --> 00:05:31,057
Whatever happens,
stay behind that shield.

57
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,996
The armor was forged by Prince Richard
the Charming, who awoke Brier-Rose.

58
00:05:35,031 --> 00:05:39,028
- Thank you.
- It reflects the powers of evil.

59
00:05:39,063 --> 00:05:41,041
- Most of the time.
- Right.

60
00:05:41,076 --> 00:05:44,341
- Surprise is critical.
- She mustn't detect us until we're...

61
00:05:48,627 --> 00:05:51,221
...ready for her.

62
00:05:51,256 --> 00:05:53,349
- Hold that.
- Positions.

63
00:05:56,307 --> 00:05:57,433
- Will?
- Ready.

64
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,587
Three, two, one.

65
00:06:04,148 --> 00:06:05,615
Huh?

66
00:06:07,796 --> 00:06:11,197
She's trying to bring the whole place down.

67
00:06:15,155 --> 00:06:16,213
Run!

68
00:06:18,452 --> 00:06:20,624
Take a shot, Jake!

69
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:23,408
She's here!
She's here! She's here!

70
00:06:23,443 --> 00:06:26,344
- I can't see the heart, Will.
- Lucifer!

71
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:28,783
Get ahold of yourself, man.

72
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:35,350
The Brothers Grimm do not fear you.

73
00:06:38,772 --> 00:06:41,400
Reload, Jake.
Don't look her in the eyes.

74
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:46,784
- Shoot, Jake.
- Something's wrong.

75
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:49,137
Hit her in the heart.

76
00:06:49,172 --> 00:06:51,231
- It won't release!
- Don't look in her eyes.

77
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:52,687
- What?
- Not the eyes.

78
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,078
She's got control over it, Will.

79
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,282
- Fight her, Jacob.
- I can't, Will!

80
00:07:05,044 --> 00:07:06,534
We're brothers, dammit.

81
00:07:08,404 --> 00:07:11,089
Be a Grimm and fight.

82
00:07:11,124 --> 00:07:15,185
We've killed worse than you!

83
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,923
Argh!

84
00:07:21,428 --> 00:07:24,158
Down! Down!
Down! Down! Down!

85
00:07:40,724 --> 00:07:44,125
Stay back.
Back. She's trying to escape.

86
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:50,577
All souls take corporeal forms,
and when they fail they find places to hide.

87
00:07:51,316 --> 00:07:55,946
Seal these in a mirror-lined box
and bury them far from any river,

88
00:07:55,981 --> 00:07:57,819
and your witch will be gone for good.

89
00:07:57,854 --> 00:07:59,439
You're a brave man.

90
00:07:59,443 --> 00:08:01,570
Take the bag.

91
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:05,680
Bless you, brothers.
Bless you.

92
00:08:05,715 --> 00:08:09,412
Whoa. We had
a legally binding agreement.

93
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,133
Oh, yes. Yes.
Of course.

94
00:08:12,168 --> 00:08:14,819
Thank you. Thank you.

95
00:08:15,572 --> 00:08:18,225
She... She is dead?

96
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,209
- Yeah, very.
- Course she is.

97
00:08:20,244 --> 00:08:24,237
She's dead.
I must tell the whole town.

98
00:08:24,272 --> 00:08:28,140
She's dead.
Our witch is dead!

99
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:36,243
That one was a bit of a nightmare.

100
00:08:38,132 --> 00:08:40,327
Don't give me that look.

101
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,328
- I was a scholar once, Will.
- Yeah, now you're famous.

102
00:08:43,363 --> 00:08:46,316
All the girls know your name.
What do you want? An apology?

103
00:08:50,452 --> 00:08:52,145
Blithering idiot!

104
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,047
Your mother was a toothless cow!

105
00:08:55,082 --> 00:08:57,794
Get me down.
Get me down!

106
00:08:58,228 --> 00:09:00,400
Sorry, Hidlick. Slipped.

107
00:09:00,435 --> 00:09:02,903
Fat Christ! What are you doing?
Trying to kill us?

108
00:09:02,938 --> 00:09:05,359
Weren't we supposed to?

109
00:09:12,596 --> 00:09:15,441
God-awful smoke!
You know, just once...

110
00:09:15,476 --> 00:09:18,934
Just once, I'd like to sell it
on the strength of my performance.

111
00:09:18,969 --> 00:09:20,912
Bunst.

112
00:09:20,947 --> 00:09:23,211
Watch out for the...

113
00:09:23,246 --> 00:09:25,649
snap boards.

114
00:09:25,684 --> 00:09:29,586
We do all the flying, the burning, the
scaring, what do we have to show for it?

115
00:09:29,621 --> 00:09:30,856
Talk to Will.

116
00:09:30,868 --> 00:09:34,129
- One tenth. Just like God.
- Exactly, one tenth.

117
00:09:34,164 --> 00:09:37,796
And for the rest, all you have to do
is ride into town and smile.

118
00:09:37,831 --> 00:09:41,428
Yes, well, talk to Napoleon.
Organize your labor, start a guild.

119
00:09:41,463 --> 00:09:44,267
There are two of us. Hm?

120
00:09:44,302 --> 00:09:46,271
Two times ten. Hm?

121
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:48,226
- We want a twentieth.
- A twentieth?

122
00:09:48,261 --> 00:09:50,180
Each.

123
00:09:53,652 --> 00:09:55,376
Done.

124
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,904
Shrewd thespians.
Now, here's the plan.

125
00:09:57,939 --> 00:10:00,561
Have a couple of days' rest
then meet us in Hamburg.

126
00:10:00,596 --> 00:10:05,898
- Jake knows a legend of a bridge troll.
- Bridge troll. Yes!

127
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:09,439
How comes he does the monsters,
I play the girlie ghosts?

128
00:10:09,474 --> 00:10:12,945
Because you, my friend, have talent.
You've got range.

129
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,752
What do I have, Will?

130
00:10:14,772 --> 00:10:17,873
You, my handsome friend, have heart.

131
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:23,175
You, bro, have enough bullshit
to fill the palace of Versailles.

132
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:29,012
Right. You want the truth of it, boys?
It's a short, brutish struggle, then you die.

133
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:32,615
Life's little subterfuges
make it all worthwhile.

134
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:34,486
Well...

135
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:39,930
Your half, Professor.

136
00:10:39,965 --> 00:10:40,912
Oh.

137
00:10:40,948 --> 00:10:43,940
Would you prefer this in magic beans?

138
00:10:45,075 --> 00:10:48,067
I'll take the beans, thanks, Will.

139
00:10:48,102 --> 00:10:50,019
Stupid!

140
00:12:22,356 --> 00:12:24,017
Who's there?

141
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,313
Hey!

142
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,459
Can you hear me?

143
00:12:35,219 --> 00:12:37,210
Where are you?

144
00:12:44,883 --> 00:12:47,984
Yes, we stood together.
Honestly.

145
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:51,182
And you were very, very brave,
weren't you?

146
00:12:51,217 --> 00:12:53,854
Who's a brave miller?
You are.

147
00:12:58,452 --> 00:13:00,317
Drink up, dear boy.

148
00:13:02,292 --> 00:13:05,360
Will Grimm. Shall we?

149
00:13:05,395 --> 00:13:08,831
Nothing comes between us brothers.
Not wicked witches.

150
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:12,817
No. And not vicious beasts in disguise.

151
00:13:12,852 --> 00:13:16,489
And not murderous queens.
No.

152
00:13:16,524 --> 00:13:19,664
Not even Godfather Death.

153
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:25,695
Because only the truest of truthful love
could ever beat the Grim Reaper.

154
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,493
- Isn't that right, Will?
- Absolutely!

155
00:13:28,528 --> 00:13:30,289
The Grim Reaper!

156
00:13:30,324 --> 00:13:34,000
Oh, I've got a story, I've got a story.
Shush. Shush.

157
00:13:34,035 --> 00:13:37,605
Once upon a time there was an imp
whose name we had to guess.

158
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,175
We had to go right down to
the flaming belly of hell to find out.

159
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,504
But we did it. We did it!

160
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:47,532
I can tell you what. This business is quite
a lucrative one. Know what I mean?

161
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:50,880
There is definitely money
to be made in witches.

162
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:52,496
Jake!

163
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:56,433
- He can't hold his ale.
- I can't hold my ale!

164
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:11,042
German pigs!

165
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:17,108
Bloody French.

166
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:21,398
Oh, kiss a froggie
and he'll turn into a prince.

167
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:22,889
Stop it, Jake.

168
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:25,231
Stop it. You're drunk.
Shut up.

169
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:32,159
Hello. <i>Bonsoir. </i>

170
00:14:33,043 --> 00:14:35,068
Something full-blooded.

171
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:37,651
Perhaps a gorgeous
Châteauneuf-du-Pape.

172
00:14:37,686 --> 00:14:40,552
Come on. 1792.

173
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:42,736
A very good year.

174
00:14:42,771 --> 00:14:47,333
<i> Vive la révolution. </i>

175
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:50,280
On the house.
Oh, no. Don't be too hasty, my friend.

176
00:14:50,315 --> 00:14:53,904
Better to let something like that breathe.

177
00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:56,339
That's the weak piss
Hans brews in the basement.

178
00:14:56,374 --> 00:14:59,708
Nice one. Nice one. So... Ow!

179
00:15:01,684 --> 00:15:04,560
Well, the music seems
to have turned horribly French.

180
00:15:04,595 --> 00:15:09,032
Shall we continue
our little philosophical discussion upstairs?

181
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:11,439
What do you say, Jake?
A little chit, a little chat.

182
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:14,970
A little huff, a little puff,
thank you very much, Will.

183
00:15:15,005 --> 00:15:16,784
There he goes.

184
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:22,815
Mythical damsels and princesses
are all he's really concerned with.

185
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,808
Very well, then. Magic awaits.

186
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:27,952
I know, we can play my favorite game.

187
00:15:27,987 --> 00:15:31,650
It's called Who's the Fairest of Them All?

188
00:15:31,685 --> 00:15:34,301
Beans, Jake. Beans.

189
00:15:35,124 --> 00:15:36,751
Beans!

190
00:15:36,787 --> 00:15:38,414
Ah, you're an idiot!

191
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:41,909
Wait for me, now, ladies.
I'm coming. I'm coming.

192
00:15:46,163 --> 00:15:47,721
Beans.

193
00:15:47,731 --> 00:15:50,399
Will, they're magic beans.

194
00:15:50,434 --> 00:15:52,977
No, they're magic beans, Will.

195
00:15:53,012 --> 00:15:58,279
And the giants will crush you
and rip out your heart.

196
00:15:59,997 --> 00:16:01,013
Shh!

197
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,205
<i>Gute Nacht. Herr Grimm. </i>

198
00:16:07,731 --> 00:16:09,926
Grimm!

199
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,592
Ik, ik, ak, ek, ek.

200
00:16:12,627 --> 00:16:16,085
- What's going on?
- How can you speak in this language?

201
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,988
Every word is like an execution.

202
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:23,836
<i>Benne. Benne. </i>

203
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:26,277
Your horses are ready.

204
00:16:26,312 --> 00:16:27,751
<i>Avanti!</i>

205
00:16:33,332 --> 00:16:36,927
You've got a rope
tied around your foot.

206
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:37,749
<i>Ciao. </i>

207
00:16:57,075 --> 00:16:59,377
- Run!
- Will! Will, wait!

208
00:16:59,412 --> 00:17:01,880
- Never fear, Jake.
- Will!

209
00:17:01,915 --> 00:17:02,864
Will!

210
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:05,163
I shall return for you.

211
00:17:08,275 --> 00:17:09,742
Nice try.

212
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,872
Hey, hey! Heagh!

213
00:17:17,523 --> 00:17:21,117
Signore, with bounteous pleasure,

214
00:17:21,152 --> 00:17:24,711
I, Mercurio Cavaldi, present to you

215
00:17:24,746 --> 00:17:27,191
the renowned, the legendary,

216
00:17:27,226 --> 00:17:29,585
the General Vavarin Delatombe,

217
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:34,683
the military commander of the kingdom
of Westphalia, formerly known as...

218
00:17:34,718 --> 00:17:36,811
- No, no, no.
... Hesse.

219
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:40,675
Exactly what am I enduring here?

220
00:17:41,715 --> 00:17:45,242
Can someone please tell me
who gave birth to this?

221
00:17:45,277 --> 00:17:48,695
It's Bavarian blood sausage,
with sauerkraut.

222
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,786
I gutted the pig myself.

223
00:17:52,564 --> 00:17:54,896
- I bet you did.
- Grimmy,

224
00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:57,836
you are to have to stand trial

225
00:17:57,871 --> 00:18:01,044
for subterfuge, theft,

226
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,218
and buggery.

227
00:18:03,253 --> 00:18:05,296
I'm sorry?

228
00:18:05,331 --> 00:18:09,165
For which the minimum sentence is...

229
00:18:11,571 --> 00:18:14,576
- Death.
- Oh, no, no. Hang on.

230
00:18:14,611 --> 00:18:18,445
- That's absolutely unnecessary.
- There's been a mistake here.

231
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:23,617
These country people, they believe things.

232
00:18:23,652 --> 00:18:26,896
We do this just to test them for science.

233
00:18:29,396 --> 00:18:32,422
- Stop. Stop it.
- Ow.

234
00:18:32,457 --> 00:18:34,362
No, no, no.

235
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:50,544
Are those... snails?

236
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:53,946
- Snails.
- Your friends have told us everything.

237
00:18:53,981 --> 00:18:56,208
Everything except one thing.

238
00:18:56,243 --> 00:18:59,248
Where are the children of Marbaden?

239
00:18:59,283 --> 00:19:05,449
- What children?
- Nine cute little <i>bambini</i> gone! Vanished.

240
00:19:05,484 --> 00:19:07,258
- We've never been to Marbaden.
- No.

241
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:10,015
Open up the cauldron.

242
00:19:12,307 --> 00:19:14,864
- No, no. Wait, no!
- Wait, wait!

243
00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:17,136
- I haven't done anything. Please.
- Please!

244
00:19:17,171 --> 00:19:20,299
- By my honor I swear. I swear!
- We didn't do it!

245
00:19:20,334 --> 00:19:22,064
Of course you didn't.

246
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:24,431
We have been observing you
for some time.

247
00:19:24,466 --> 00:19:26,303
Cavaldi, stop.

248
00:19:26,338 --> 00:19:27,759
Huh?

249
00:19:29,587 --> 00:19:31,851
Please.

250
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:40,284
No, he said stop it!

251
00:19:44,531 --> 00:19:48,627
However, someone in Marbaden
is working as you.

252
00:19:48,662 --> 00:19:51,663
Same talents, same tricks.

253
00:19:51,698 --> 00:19:54,665
It is a thorn in my toe.

254
00:19:55,187 --> 00:19:59,920
You pull it out,
I might be persuaded to offer you amnesty.

255
00:20:00,755 --> 00:20:03,483
So you mean, if we work for you...

256
00:20:03,518 --> 00:20:06,212
- That's right, Jacob.
... French?

257
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,299
<i>Bien sûr. </i>

258
00:20:08,334 --> 00:20:10,352
Go to Marbaden.

259
00:20:10,355 --> 00:20:12,890
Unmask these villains.

260
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:15,425
Find the missing children.

261
00:20:18,611 --> 00:20:22,172
Hans, we have to stay
where we can still see the village.

262
00:20:22,207 --> 00:20:24,361
Not if we're going to find the missing girls.

263
00:20:24,371 --> 00:20:26,339
We're going too far.

264
00:20:26,355 --> 00:20:29,744
Greta, nothing has ever happened
to anyone in daytime.

265
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:35,740
And in the very middle of the wood
was the witch's gingerbread house.

266
00:20:50,323 --> 00:20:52,314
Hans!

267
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:18,067
Hey! Come back!

268
00:21:22,995 --> 00:21:24,986
Got ya!

269
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,873
Greta! Greta!

270
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:04,066
Lieutenant, keep your eyes open.

271
00:23:04,101 --> 00:23:06,817
Sergeant, they are mine.

272
00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:14,704
You go and sell

273
00:23:14,739 --> 00:23:17,207
your oil of snake, Grimmy.

274
00:23:27,635 --> 00:23:29,694
Good people of M... Agh!

275
00:23:29,729 --> 00:23:31,445
It was a long trip.

276
00:23:32,562 --> 00:23:35,122
People of Marbaden.

277
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:37,182
Hello. Anyone there?

278
00:23:39,282 --> 00:23:41,375
Anybody there?

279
00:23:42,707 --> 00:23:44,038
Say, brother.

280
00:23:44,051 --> 00:23:47,987
Why don't you have a look round? Make
sure there's no French soldiers anywhere.

281
00:23:48,022 --> 00:23:50,223
We wouldn't want to run into any French...

282
00:23:50,258 --> 00:23:52,094
Oh. Hey, morning. Hello.

283
00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:54,347
Will, there's a...

284
00:23:54,382 --> 00:23:55,950
Ah. Morning.

285
00:23:57,971 --> 00:23:59,131
- What..?
- Hello.

286
00:24:04,275 --> 00:24:05,833
Who are you?

287
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:08,139
- Allow me.
- Uh...

288
00:24:08,595 --> 00:24:11,564
Grimm is the name. Two <i>m</i>s.

289
00:24:12,307 --> 00:24:14,400
We are the Brothers Grimm.

290
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,959
- They don't know who we are.
- Stand aside, Gregor.

291
00:24:20,994 --> 00:24:22,835
I'll deal with this.

292
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,676
What's your business?

293
00:24:24,691 --> 00:24:27,524
We're here to save your land
from evil enchantments.

294
00:24:28,755 --> 00:24:32,589
Too late.
The old ways have returned.

295
00:24:35,283 --> 00:24:37,376
You handle it, Jake.

296
00:24:37,411 --> 00:24:38,853
Uh...

297
00:24:38,867 --> 00:24:42,064
Well, we're from Kassel, near Frankfurt.

298
00:24:42,931 --> 00:24:46,247
- We've heard about your missing children.
- Food for trolls.

299
00:24:46,282 --> 00:24:49,564
Hold your tongue, you old witch,
or you'll get another ducking.

300
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:52,085
Papa, Papa!
They can help us.

301
00:24:53,267 --> 00:24:54,928
Stay back.

302
00:24:54,931 --> 00:24:59,425
It's all right. They're the Brothers Grimm.
People talk about them in Malsburg.

303
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,181
Right you are, son.
The famous Brothers Grimm.

304
00:25:02,216 --> 00:25:04,190
Look at this strapping young lad.

305
00:25:04,225 --> 00:25:06,340
"He" is my daughter.

306
00:25:08,051 --> 00:25:10,896
And a fine wife he'll make some lucky man.

307
00:25:10,931 --> 00:25:14,992
- They kill trolls and giants, Papa.
- That's right. Of course we do, darling.

308
00:25:15,027 --> 00:25:17,131
Jake, me...

309
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:19,235
the team.

310
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:23,887
Team Grimm at your service.

311
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:27,600
We were trying to find
and rescue the others.

312
00:25:27,635 --> 00:25:32,299
Greta was afraid. She thought there really
was a witch in the gingerbread house.

313
00:25:32,334 --> 00:25:35,080
Then birds stole our trail of crumbs.

314
00:25:35,115 --> 00:25:37,927
It was a trap.
The forest made it.

315
00:25:37,962 --> 00:25:40,740
Yes. Yes, it took my daughter too.

316
00:25:40,775 --> 00:25:42,352
- Mine too.
- And mine.

317
00:25:42,387 --> 00:25:46,381
- Ten girls are missing.
- Trees themselves set upon her.

318
00:25:46,416 --> 00:25:50,376
Up and snatched her away.
Just left her little riding cape.

319
00:25:50,411 --> 00:25:51,758
Like a wolf.

320
00:25:51,762 --> 00:25:54,663
And when my daughter ran, it took flight.

321
00:25:54,698 --> 00:25:57,409
Do you understand?
It flew!

322
00:25:57,444 --> 00:25:59,184
Flying beast.

323
00:25:59,219 --> 00:26:03,428
Rope pulley. Snap boards.
Fishing line. Wolf pelt. It's expensive.

324
00:26:03,463 --> 00:26:07,637
Our people always knew
that the forest was enchanted.

325
00:26:07,672 --> 00:26:09,519
But it's never turned against us.

326
00:26:09,554 --> 00:26:13,012
- Until now.
- Until the French occupation.

327
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:20,299
And it's all
the fault of the French!

328
00:26:26,738 --> 00:26:29,070
<i>Silenzio!</i>

329
00:26:34,899 --> 00:26:37,744
Good citizens,

330
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:40,592
you have nothing further to fear.

331
00:26:40,627 --> 00:26:43,406
The Brothers Grimm are with you now.

332
00:26:43,441 --> 00:26:46,576
Your salvation is at hand.

333
00:26:47,698 --> 00:26:51,464
Now, we need a guide.
Someone who knows the forest.

334
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,795
- There is one.
- Who?

335
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:59,439
- Who?
- Who?

336
00:26:59,474 --> 00:27:02,272
- The trapper.
- The cursed one.

337
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:11,498
Perfect.

338
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:19,200
Excuse me, Herr Krauss?

339
00:27:20,467 --> 00:27:22,059
Um...

340
00:27:23,026 --> 00:27:26,393
Hello, there. We've come
to help find the missing children.

341
00:27:26,428 --> 00:27:29,520
We'll only need a few hours of your time.

342
00:27:30,963 --> 00:27:31,987
Oh.

343
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:35,010
Sorry. Is your father here?

344
00:27:36,979 --> 00:27:38,970
Husband?

345
00:27:40,627 --> 00:27:43,221
Is there a man of any..?

346
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,841
Cursed.

347
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:54,781
Miss Krauss, perhaps you don't realize
who we are. We're the Brothers Grimm.

348
00:27:54,816 --> 00:27:58,128
We vanquished the mill witch of Karlstadt,
the frog boy of Glutenhof,

349
00:27:58,163 --> 00:28:04,068
and the cannibal chef of the Schwarzwald
in the gingerbread house of terror.

350
00:28:04,103 --> 00:28:08,190
Miss, we need a guide, someone
who knows the paths through the forest.

351
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:17,922
We'll pay you money.

352
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:24,399
Well, beads and... pretty shiny things
from the big city.

353
00:28:25,266 --> 00:28:26,460
Oh...

354
00:28:26,515 --> 00:28:30,952
Miss, we believe your village
may be under some kind of curse.

355
00:28:30,987 --> 00:28:32,993
Think I care about the village?

356
00:28:39,699 --> 00:28:40,961
<i>Scusi. </i>

357
00:28:40,978 --> 00:28:44,778
But he was trying to run away.

358
00:28:53,075 --> 00:28:56,408
Are you aware that ten girls in this village
have gone missing?

359
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:59,728
Two of those girls were my sisters.

360
00:28:59,763 --> 00:29:05,030
If your sisters are lucky sisters,
they are dead sisters.

361
00:29:05,065 --> 00:29:07,471
Who's your friend?

362
00:29:07,506 --> 00:29:09,167
- Um...
- I?

363
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,536
Who am I?

364
00:29:11,571 --> 00:29:15,667
I am Mercurio Cavaldi,
of the great Cavaldis of Parma,

365
00:29:15,702 --> 00:29:19,268
the master of the torturing arts.

366
00:29:19,303 --> 00:29:21,583
Steady, Cavaldi.

367
00:29:21,618 --> 00:29:23,984
We need her warm and breathing.

368
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:35,392
Good people of Marbaden,
your daughters will be returned.

369
00:29:35,427 --> 00:29:41,314
And you shall regain
your courage and your joy.

370
00:29:44,786 --> 00:29:47,448
To the forest!

371
00:29:47,483 --> 00:29:49,038
Hah! Hah!

372
00:29:55,858 --> 00:29:56,847
Cursed!

373
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:16,158
I don't know if I mentioned it,
but my name's Will.

374
00:30:16,193 --> 00:30:18,241
That's my brother Jake.

375
00:30:21,746 --> 00:30:24,306
I don't know if I mentioned it,
but my name's Will.

376
00:30:24,341 --> 00:30:26,064
- That's my brother...
- Angelika.

377
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:28,463
Lovely.
Whatever trickster we're hunting -

378
00:30:28,498 --> 00:30:32,457
and by "trickster" of course I mean
"demon" - he's got to have a hideout.

379
00:30:32,492 --> 00:30:34,805
He's got to have a base of operations.

380
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,871
For example, these caves here.

381
00:30:37,906 --> 00:30:41,280
Nothing there.
Just animal bones and old drawings.

382
00:30:41,315 --> 00:30:44,654
Nine times out of ten,
there's a human perpetrator.

383
00:30:46,034 --> 00:30:48,366
Apparently we're on foot from here.

384
00:30:48,401 --> 00:30:50,603
Why?
Why we go this way?

385
00:30:50,638 --> 00:30:52,431
Why?

386
00:30:52,466 --> 00:30:56,197
Because even the animals
would never come this way.

387
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:03,028
- No weapons?
- Weapons, uh...

388
00:31:03,063 --> 00:31:05,551
We keep the weapons.

389
00:31:05,586 --> 00:31:08,919
We work with other tools, Angelika.

390
00:31:28,755 --> 00:31:30,607
Don't be afraid.

391
00:31:30,642 --> 00:31:34,237
I know this sophisticated technology
must look very strange to you.

392
00:31:34,272 --> 00:31:36,958
- What exactly is it meant to do?
- Shh!

393
00:31:46,899 --> 00:31:48,560
Right.

394
00:31:48,563 --> 00:31:50,724
I feel it's safe to proceed.

395
00:31:56,818 --> 00:31:59,616
You understand,
this really is exciting for us.

396
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,607
Our folk tales
sprang from places just like this.

397
00:32:02,642 --> 00:32:08,638
I mean, it's funny, everywhere you look
you can feel the forest's ancient power.

398
00:32:12,658 --> 00:32:14,285
I mean... Ough!

399
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:17,295
I mean, to our ancestors
this place was sacred.

400
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:21,096
Till the Christians invaded.
Now it's just territory.

401
00:32:21,131 --> 00:32:23,275
Territory?

402
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,837
Oh. Oh!

403
00:32:29,843 --> 00:32:31,401
Heavens above!

404
00:32:31,411 --> 00:32:33,871
Will. Will, look at this.

405
00:32:33,906 --> 00:32:38,468
- So the Christian king built all this?
- In the middle of the forest?

406
00:32:38,503 --> 00:32:40,412
They cut it down.

407
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,298
It grew back.

408
00:32:55,442 --> 00:32:57,842
I thought you said
the animals don't come here.

409
00:32:57,877 --> 00:33:01,143
The animals don't drink from the spring.

410
00:33:01,683 --> 00:33:03,674
<i>Merde!</i>

411
00:33:04,786 --> 00:33:06,447
I mean...

412
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:08,247
<i>Scheiße. </i> Urgh!

413
00:33:08,282 --> 00:33:10,005
<i>Scheiße!</i>

414
00:33:13,522 --> 00:33:18,357
Are you feeling it, Will? I sense, so far,
dread. It's almost like a smell.

415
00:33:18,392 --> 00:33:20,353
Of death.

416
00:33:22,354 --> 00:33:24,413
Excuse me. Sorry.

417
00:33:25,298 --> 00:33:29,530
You're not afraid, are you?
Not like the villagers.

418
00:33:37,586 --> 00:33:39,315
Ah, so, um...

419
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:41,700
What happened here?

420
00:33:41,714 --> 00:33:45,081
The Christian king
destroyed the forest people.

421
00:33:45,116 --> 00:33:47,670
Burnt them to death in the caves.

422
00:33:47,705 --> 00:33:50,000
What an awful story.

423
00:33:50,035 --> 00:33:52,314
They were the lucky ones.

424
00:33:52,349 --> 00:33:54,544
A year later the plague came.

425
00:33:54,579 --> 00:33:58,071
Jake, we really should search the tower.

426
00:33:58,106 --> 00:34:00,129
There's no way in.

427
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,719
Never was.

428
00:34:04,754 --> 00:34:06,244
<i> Angelika. </i>

429
00:34:06,258 --> 00:34:07,350
Angelika.

430
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:11,919
Look. You see that window?
Way, way up high.

431
00:34:11,954 --> 00:34:16,550
Many centuries ago,
that's where the queen lived.

432
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:20,643
<i>She was treasured by all of Europe</i>.

433
00:34:20,678 --> 00:34:23,797
<i>Famed for her incredible beauty. </i>

434
00:34:23,832 --> 00:34:26,543
<i>But also vain and selfish. </i>

435
00:34:26,578 --> 00:34:30,255
<i>Her world was her own reflection. </i>

436
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:34,886
<i>It was on the queen's wedding day</i>
<i>that the plague arrived. </i>

437
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:40,264
<i>The king was the first to die. </i>

438
00:34:41,106 --> 00:34:43,597
<i>His bride built a tower. </i>

439
00:34:44,466 --> 00:34:48,208
<i>She locked herself away</i>.
<i>Safe from the horrors below</i>.

440
00:34:48,243 --> 00:34:53,340
<i>But what she forgot was that</i>
<i>plague is carried on the winds. </i>

441
00:34:54,642 --> 00:35:01,741
When she first fell sick and
her gorgeous flesh began to rot away,

442
00:35:01,776 --> 00:35:06,619
they say you could hear her screams
across the oceans.

443
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:11,829
My princess isn't afraid, is she?

444
00:35:12,658 --> 00:35:15,054
It's just an old story.

445
00:35:15,089 --> 00:35:17,450
Papa's here to protect you.

446
00:35:22,674 --> 00:35:25,263
<i>The Cursed Ruins. </i>

447
00:35:25,298 --> 00:35:29,291
Oh, yeah. Now, that's good. Uh-huh.
<i>The Cursed Ruins. </i>

448
00:35:30,354 --> 00:35:32,413
<i>Ruins</i>. By Ja...

449
00:35:35,986 --> 00:35:37,010
Hm.

450
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:41,633
<i>Cursed Ruins</i> by Jac...

451
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:47,503
Mm-hm. Hm.

452
00:35:52,242 --> 00:35:54,733
By Jacob Grimm.

453
00:36:00,498 --> 00:36:01,624
Will.

454
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,015
Will. Will!

455
00:36:25,202 --> 00:36:27,636
Argh! Ha!

456
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:35,736
Oh!

457
00:36:42,418 --> 00:36:45,819
I'll kill you and take your eggs
and smash them all in and...

458
00:36:56,018 --> 00:36:59,283
Spooky, spooky, spooky.

459
00:37:07,762 --> 00:37:11,279
I'm afraid my instruments
aren't detecting much.

460
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:14,806
Let's call it a day before it gets,
you know, too dark.

461
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:17,206
- We should leave.
- Angelika.

462
00:37:17,241 --> 00:37:19,983
Excuse me, uh...

463
00:37:20,018 --> 00:37:23,249
- We came from that direction.
- That's not the way.

464
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:25,711
We walked right past those birds' trees.

465
00:37:25,746 --> 00:37:28,579
- It's this way.
- That's the way we are walking out.

466
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:32,081
Don't trust the trees.

467
00:37:36,658 --> 00:37:38,489
Hello, Grandmother Toad.

468
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,872
- Show us the path.
- Oh, God.

469
00:37:42,907 --> 00:37:45,854
Show us the way and I'll give you a kiss.

470
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:50,733
Oh, my, that's just not right.

471
00:37:51,762 --> 00:37:53,889
Sh, sh, sh.

472
00:37:58,482 --> 00:38:00,074
That way.

473
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:02,844
You're sure, Grandmother?

474
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:04,927
As I thought.

475
00:38:06,066 --> 00:38:08,296
- Yeah, right.
- You don't believe me?

476
00:38:08,331 --> 00:38:10,287
Well...

477
00:38:10,322 --> 00:38:12,449
Taste for yourself.

478
00:38:21,682 --> 00:38:24,742
- We did not come this way.
- What's her game?

479
00:38:24,777 --> 00:38:27,055
I don't think she's putting it on, Will.

480
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,334
There was some kind of
presence back there.

481
00:38:29,369 --> 00:38:31,231
Oh, shut up, Jacob!

482
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:34,481
Did you fall for this spooky dance number?
You mooncalf.

483
00:38:34,516 --> 00:38:35,712
Mooncalf?

484
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:40,292
She is up to something. I don't trust her.
I'd slip her the goldfish but I...

485
00:38:40,327 --> 00:38:42,305
And here we are.

486
00:38:43,442 --> 00:38:46,172
Nicely done, Angelika.
Knew you'd find it.

487
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,197
Hey, hey.

488
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:51,329
Here, boy. Whoa.

489
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:54,144
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

490
00:38:54,179 --> 00:38:56,064
Calm down.

491
00:38:59,442 --> 00:39:00,841
Oh.

492
00:39:02,354 --> 00:39:04,879
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

493
00:39:04,882 --> 00:39:07,407
Whoa.

494
00:39:18,994 --> 00:39:24,091
Fruitful expedition. Many things
learned. Many things learned indeed.

495
00:39:24,126 --> 00:39:25,751
Won't be long now.

496
00:39:25,786 --> 00:39:27,737
Sasha.

497
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,831
Shall we regroup at dawn tomorrow?

498
00:39:30,866 --> 00:39:33,519
Give you boys enough time
for your beauty sleep.

499
00:39:33,554 --> 00:39:36,648
- You're on your own tomorrow.
- Sorry. What?

500
00:39:36,683 --> 00:39:38,594
I said, you're on your own tomorrow.

501
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,942
- What's she say?
- She said we're on our own.

502
00:39:40,977 --> 00:39:43,576
You forced me to show you the forest.

503
00:39:43,611 --> 00:39:45,665
I showed you the forest.

504
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:49,506
It's all right.
I'll handle this one.

505
00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:52,940
Would you hitch my horse, Will?

506
00:39:55,345 --> 00:39:57,472
Are you all right?

507
00:39:58,258 --> 00:40:00,385
Can I come in?

508
00:40:03,666 --> 00:40:05,964
These drawings are very good, you know.

509
00:40:05,999 --> 00:40:08,406
I do a bit of drawing myself.

510
00:40:08,441 --> 00:40:10,463
I'm not bad.

511
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,927
Angelika,

512
00:40:14,962 --> 00:40:19,399
there was power in that place,
wasn't there? The tower.

513
00:40:20,114 --> 00:40:22,639
Father used to take us there.

514
00:40:22,994 --> 00:40:25,498
And where is he now?

515
00:40:25,533 --> 00:40:27,919
- He died.
- Oh.

516
00:40:27,954 --> 00:40:30,821
Last winter.
They say the wolves took him.

517
00:40:30,856 --> 00:40:32,750
The wolves?

518
00:40:32,785 --> 00:40:35,855
Look, if you won't guide us,
would you at least give us a map?

519
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:39,656
- A map wouldn't do you any good.
- A lot more good than it would do you.

520
00:40:39,691 --> 00:40:41,797
At least we can read.
Come on, Jake.

521
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:45,359
You people think you know everything.
I've been to the city.

522
00:40:45,394 --> 00:40:49,228
My father saved every penny he earned
to buy me a proper education.

523
00:40:49,263 --> 00:40:51,402
Ah, money down the drain, if you ask me.

524
00:40:51,437 --> 00:40:52,810
You're right.

525
00:40:52,818 --> 00:40:57,346
After he died, my sisters were left alone.
They were the first to be taken.

526
00:40:57,381 --> 00:40:59,862
That's why they call you cursed.

527
00:41:00,722 --> 00:41:02,713
Yeah.

528
00:41:05,234 --> 00:41:11,002
So tell me again, famous Brother Grimm,
how exactly do you intend to save us?

529
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:19,284
I think I'll do my own searching.

530
00:41:25,522 --> 00:41:28,514
I thought that went rather well.

531
00:41:30,934 --> 00:41:33,249
Gift. For surprise.

532
00:41:34,706 --> 00:41:37,174
For you. Tasty.

533
00:41:37,209 --> 00:41:39,129
Argh!

534
00:41:41,297 --> 00:41:44,239
Such German hospitality.

535
00:41:44,274 --> 00:41:48,210
The Brothers Grimm will thank you
for your kindness.

536
00:41:48,245 --> 00:41:50,082
Oh!

537
00:41:57,957 --> 00:42:00,205
I'm starving.

538
00:42:01,105 --> 00:42:06,008
No, no, no, no, no.
Not for you, my little Cinderellas.

539
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:22,658
Help me.

540
00:42:49,042 --> 00:42:51,501
There, there.

541
00:42:51,536 --> 00:42:53,903
It's all right.

542
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:56,498
What a pretty horse you are.

543
00:42:57,426 --> 00:42:59,860
Such big eyes you have.

544
00:43:00,722 --> 00:43:03,439
And big ears you have.

545
00:43:03,474 --> 00:43:07,808
And such a pretty, pretty mouth.

546
00:43:09,202 --> 00:43:10,430
Ugh!

547
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:36,220
Sorry.

548
00:43:37,873 --> 00:43:39,568
Huh? Where'd that come from?

549
00:43:45,938 --> 00:43:47,547
Ho, hey!

550
00:43:47,582 --> 00:43:49,156
Easy, easy.

551
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:51,297
Steady, easy.

552
00:43:57,265 --> 00:43:59,324
- Elsie!
- Help!

553
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:05,139
They could mechanize the horse,
put it on tracks.

554
00:44:05,174 --> 00:44:07,829
- There were no tracks.
- Get out of the way.

555
00:44:07,864 --> 00:44:10,095
Angelika.

556
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:11,757
- What about mirrors?
- Elsie!

557
00:44:11,762 --> 00:44:14,230
You use a real animal
and a warped mirror.

558
00:44:14,265 --> 00:44:16,627
That as my horse.
That was Pepper.

559
00:44:16,662 --> 00:44:20,975
What is happening?

560
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:23,501
- I should catch that horse.
- Grimmy?

561
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:25,704
- You're wearing a bonnet.
- So are you.

562
00:44:29,938 --> 00:44:31,633
Heagh! Heagh!

563
00:44:33,842 --> 00:44:35,663
Heagh!

564
00:44:35,698 --> 00:44:37,775
Faster! Faster, Will.

565
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:41,871
Dax, Letorc,
don't lose sight of the Grimmy.

566
00:44:41,906 --> 00:44:45,269
Go on. Kick him, kick him, Will!

567
00:44:50,385 --> 00:44:52,216
Ugh!

568
00:44:53,842 --> 00:44:56,072
Tripwires!
There's someone in the woods.

569
00:44:56,081 --> 00:44:58,049
Watch out!

570
00:45:07,986 --> 00:45:11,444
- Will, are you seeing what I'm seeing?
- I most definitely am not.

571
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:24,394
They've put the woods on wheels.

572
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,843
- Those trees on tracks.
- Will...

573
00:45:27,878 --> 00:45:30,419
Pulley system. Expensive.

574
00:45:32,273 --> 00:45:34,702
Control your horses.

575
00:45:34,737 --> 00:45:38,673
Don't lose sight of the Grimmy.
Go, go. <i>Idioti!</i>

576
00:45:39,122 --> 00:45:42,114
I've been looking for you.

577
00:45:51,217 --> 00:45:53,722
Stralda, what's happening?

578
00:45:53,757 --> 00:45:56,228
<i>Avanti. Avanti. Avanti!</i>

579
00:45:56,263 --> 00:45:57,198
Gie, gie, gie!

580
00:46:09,778 --> 00:46:11,939
You can see they're on tracks.

581
00:46:14,065 --> 00:46:16,795
- Show yourselves!
- There, there, there!

582
00:46:17,425 --> 00:46:19,552
Can you hear me?

583
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:25,582
What is this, Grimms?
What is happening?

584
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:28,450
These people are
much better funded than we are.

585
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:33,878
Get down! Get down.

586
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:47,736
Wait!

587
00:46:50,289 --> 00:46:52,553
Stop, Will.

588
00:46:56,177 --> 00:46:58,377
Help me!

589
00:46:58,412 --> 00:47:00,527
Help!

590
00:47:00,562 --> 00:47:04,225
<i>Aschenputtel!</i>

591
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,440
Run! Run!

592
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:08,510
His eyes.

593
00:48:12,145 --> 00:48:14,204
His eyes.

594
00:48:16,465 --> 00:48:18,592
My hair.

595
00:48:26,577 --> 00:48:28,395
Letorc?

596
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:30,214
Dax?

597
00:48:30,225 --> 00:48:35,629
Can you hear my voice?
I command you, fall in.

598
00:48:38,065 --> 00:48:41,057
How many times do I have to tell you?

599
00:48:56,145 --> 00:48:58,734
There you go. Can't breathe.

600
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,870
This is so incredible.

601
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:05,231
This changes everything.
Gotta write this down. That was real.

602
00:49:05,266 --> 00:49:10,033
Beans, Jake. Magic beans. There is
a rational explanation for all of this.

603
00:49:10,068 --> 00:49:12,897
What do you mean?
Rational explanation? The bugs were...

604
00:49:12,932 --> 00:49:14,872
And the forest was sweeping down on us.

605
00:49:14,897 --> 00:49:16,330
Stop it, Jake!

606
00:49:16,337 --> 00:49:18,805
- It was like everything was under a spell.
- Or curse.

607
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:22,135
- What?
- My whole family's cursed.

608
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:25,759
My father...
Father...

609
00:49:26,705 --> 00:49:29,265
- What about your father?
- I have to go back.

610
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,565
Angelika...

611
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:35,394
On the ground.
On the ground, <i>crucchi bastardi!</i>

612
00:49:35,429 --> 00:49:39,621
Go down, now!
On the ground.

613
00:49:39,656 --> 00:49:43,814
Now, who killed my men, huh?

614
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:45,997
You tell me, Grimmy.

615
00:49:46,032 --> 00:49:48,110
Who? Or she will die.

616
00:49:48,145 --> 00:49:50,613
It was the forest.

617
00:49:50,648 --> 00:49:53,009
German peasant.

618
00:49:53,585 --> 00:49:56,645
And if you stay it will destroy you too.

619
00:49:58,641 --> 00:50:00,462
<i>Mesdames et messieurs</i>.

620
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:04,831
The emperor honors me with a visit
from you, his most trusted advisors.

621
00:50:08,433 --> 00:50:10,190
I salute you.

622
00:50:10,225 --> 00:50:15,128
Your shining examples illuminate
this dark German forest of ignorance and...

623
00:50:15,163 --> 00:50:17,721
<i> Dov'è il generale?</i>

624
00:50:19,153 --> 00:50:21,519
Ah! <i>Il generale!</i>

625
00:50:21,554 --> 00:50:22,979
Finally, finally!

626
00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:26,489
General... Ah!

627
00:50:26,514 --> 00:50:28,982
<i>Guten Tag. Buongiorno. </i>

628
00:50:29,017 --> 00:50:30,702
<i>Bonjour. </i>

629
00:50:30,737 --> 00:50:33,331
<i>Bonjour. </i>

630
00:50:34,289 --> 00:50:38,589
General, your soldiers...

631
00:50:38,624 --> 00:50:39,641
<i>finito. </i>

632
00:50:39,665 --> 00:50:41,678
They are dead.

633
00:50:41,713 --> 00:50:44,270
I'm lucky survived. See?

634
00:50:44,305 --> 00:50:47,797
Here, just this little wound.

635
00:50:47,832 --> 00:50:51,322
Just a little, little itchy scratch.

636
00:51:08,529 --> 00:51:11,396
We begin with lobster bisque.

637
00:51:11,431 --> 00:51:12,369
Ah!

638
00:51:12,401 --> 00:51:14,274
You embarrass me.

639
00:51:14,309 --> 00:51:16,110
You ridicule me!

640
00:51:16,145 --> 00:51:19,308
You insult me in front of my guests.

641
00:51:19,343 --> 00:51:21,909
These people are Parisians.

642
00:51:21,944 --> 00:51:23,822
No, no! Argh!

643
00:51:23,857 --> 00:51:26,670
They tried to blind Cavaldi

644
00:51:26,705 --> 00:51:31,039
with their fairy tales
and devouring trees and flying wolves.

645
00:51:31,074 --> 00:51:33,873
But I use my logical brain, Generale.

646
00:51:33,908 --> 00:51:36,672
I can make this as clear as crystal.

647
00:51:36,707 --> 00:51:39,999
I am in no way responsible.

648
00:51:40,034 --> 00:51:43,291
It is them.
They are the ones.

649
00:51:43,326 --> 00:51:45,447
The Grimmy!

650
00:51:47,601 --> 00:51:50,607
The plan is very simple.

651
00:51:50,642 --> 00:51:53,454
They use the little girls as bait,

652
00:51:53,489 --> 00:51:57,425
they lure your soldiers
into the forest, and, uh...

653
00:51:58,289 --> 00:52:00,223
- Bingo.
- Bingo?

654
00:52:00,258 --> 00:52:02,401
Yes. Shh.

655
00:52:02,436 --> 00:52:04,494
It's bingo.

656
00:52:04,529 --> 00:52:08,348
General, we are outmaneuvered,
outflanked, outnumbered

657
00:52:08,383 --> 00:52:12,167
by some German force
which threatens your superiorit...

658
00:52:13,585 --> 00:52:14,847
Grimms.

659
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:18,318
What precisely happened in the forest?

660
00:52:18,353 --> 00:52:22,619
General, I believe we witnessed
a case of authenticated enchantment.

661
00:52:22,654 --> 00:52:25,639
We're not saying that.
That is not our official position.

662
00:52:25,674 --> 00:52:27,676
But it's true.

663
00:52:28,593 --> 00:52:30,220
Kill them.

664
00:52:30,225 --> 00:52:32,420
I will deal with you later.

665
00:52:32,455 --> 00:52:34,528
No, monsieur.

666
00:52:36,241 --> 00:52:38,190
Don't kill.

667
00:52:38,225 --> 00:52:42,355
I can make them speak.

668
00:52:44,433 --> 00:52:46,060
<i>Musica. </i>

669
00:52:49,609 --> 00:52:50,749
Huh?

670
00:52:55,249 --> 00:52:57,308
Wait! No! Stop!

671
00:52:57,329 --> 00:52:59,422
No, no, no, no, no!

672
00:53:03,089 --> 00:53:06,126
This is nothing to do with me.
He forced...

673
00:53:06,161 --> 00:53:09,006
- She's innocent. Let her go.
- Stop!

674
00:53:09,041 --> 00:53:13,910
General, you keep working with Cavaldi,
this country won't be yours much longer.

675
00:53:13,945 --> 00:53:19,215
- He panics.
- The great Cavaldi never panics.

676
00:53:23,729 --> 00:53:25,720
Uh...

677
00:53:29,457 --> 00:53:31,246
Hm.

678
00:53:31,281 --> 00:53:33,044
<i>À point. </i>

679
00:53:33,681 --> 00:53:36,241
<i>Bon appétit. Mes chiens. </i>

680
00:53:38,193 --> 00:53:40,218
- Stop!
- General!

681
00:53:40,253 --> 00:53:42,302
Cavaldi was right.

682
00:53:42,449 --> 00:53:44,576
Cavaldi was right.

683
00:53:44,913 --> 00:53:46,710
We saw them. We did.

684
00:53:46,993 --> 00:53:49,757
There was three in the trees,
two in the caves.

685
00:53:49,792 --> 00:53:51,470
Huge men. With weapons.

686
00:53:51,505 --> 00:53:55,532
My masterpiece is working.
Truth comes out.

687
00:53:55,985 --> 00:54:00,684
These are backward people. They cling to
folklore because it gives them strength.

688
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:02,830
Stop. You're giving them what they want.

689
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:05,518
The longer this goes on,
the more Germans will talk like her.

690
00:54:05,553 --> 00:54:09,922
- Then arm themselves, organize...
- Then the problem won't be just a forest.

691
00:54:09,957 --> 00:54:11,627
- It shall be a nation!
- Yes!

692
00:54:11,662 --> 00:54:13,262
- Let us do it our way.
- Yes!

693
00:54:13,297 --> 00:54:16,266
- Send us back into the forest.
- Ye... What?

694
00:54:17,233 --> 00:54:19,463
We'll lie in wait
with our men, our equipment.

695
00:54:19,498 --> 00:54:21,775
- No, no...
- General, trust me.

696
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:24,053
Let us rig a surprise for them.

697
00:54:30,737 --> 00:54:32,728
Cavaldi, stop.

698
00:54:33,713 --> 00:54:35,806
- Huh?
- Stop!

699
00:54:54,289 --> 00:54:56,658
Very well, Grimms.

700
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:59,873
You shall return to the forest.

701
00:54:59,908 --> 00:55:03,054
But I warn you,
attempt to escape

702
00:55:03,089 --> 00:55:05,997
and I shall raze every tree,

703
00:55:06,032 --> 00:55:08,846
demolish every building,

704
00:55:08,881 --> 00:55:12,749
slaughter every innocent in search of you.

705
00:55:13,585 --> 00:55:15,075
You understand?

706
00:55:18,545 --> 00:55:19,739
<i>Bon. </i>

707
00:55:50,449 --> 00:55:52,576
Mind his head.

708
00:55:56,433 --> 00:55:59,698
Pack the horses with as much gear
as they can carry, all right?

709
00:55:59,733 --> 00:56:03,626
I'm a little unclear
as to who exactly we're up against.

710
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:06,938
Just stay close to your horse.

711
00:56:12,272 --> 00:56:14,350
Jake. Jake.

712
00:56:14,385 --> 00:56:15,409
- Listen.
- What?

713
00:56:15,473 --> 00:56:17,774
Go and get back on your horse.

714
00:56:17,809 --> 00:56:21,176
- We're gonna make a run for it.
- I remember the rest of the story.

715
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,766
What are you talking about?

716
00:56:22,769 --> 00:56:25,294
- It's an ancient folklore, passed down...
- Jake!

717
00:56:25,329 --> 00:56:28,564
The tower, the queen, her story, it's...

718
00:56:28,599 --> 00:56:30,254
- Before the plague...
- Jacob.

719
00:56:30,289 --> 00:56:35,158
...the queen killed all the villagers'
ancestors to get her hands on their spells.

720
00:56:35,193 --> 00:56:39,428
- And one was a spell for eternal life.
- Give me that stupid book!

721
00:56:39,463 --> 00:56:42,212
- She's still in the tower. She's there now.
- Jake.


722
00:56:42,673 --> 00:56:46,507
You've got to understand something.
This is not about the story.

723
00:56:46,542 --> 00:56:50,046
It's about you and her.
You want to rescue her.

724
00:56:50,081 --> 00:56:51,822
That's right, Will.

725
00:56:51,857 --> 00:56:54,519
Because she's part of the story.

726
00:57:00,176 --> 00:57:03,407
She's still there. Isn't she?
The queen. She's still in the tower.

727
00:57:03,442 --> 00:57:06,235
She's been there for centuries now,
waiting for someone.

728
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:09,028
To serve her and find
the one spell they kept hidden.

729
00:57:09,063 --> 00:57:12,046
It's just a story to scare children.

730
00:57:12,081 --> 00:57:15,893
Well, now, that's not the truth, Angelika.
I know you believe.

731
00:57:15,928 --> 00:57:19,705
Ignore him. He wishes his whole life
was something out of a book.

732
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:22,088
- Now he thinks he's in love.
- Shut up, Will!

733
00:57:22,123 --> 00:57:24,366
Angelika, do what your father wanted,
leave now.

734
00:57:24,401 --> 00:57:27,598
- No. I'm going to find my sisters.
- Will doesn't care about them.

735
00:57:27,633 --> 00:57:29,864
Will doesn't care about
anything but himself.

736
00:57:29,899 --> 00:57:32,096
This isn't a fairy tale.
They won't come back.

737
00:57:32,131 --> 00:57:35,209
This is not your world, Will!

738
00:57:37,008 --> 00:57:38,862
Angelika.

739
00:57:38,897 --> 00:57:41,024
You know, don't you?

740
00:57:42,097 --> 00:57:45,773
The story, it's happening to us now.

741
00:57:45,808 --> 00:57:50,677
We're living it.
It's alive, it's real, it's breathing.

742
00:57:52,561 --> 00:57:55,462
And we can give it a happy ending.

743
00:57:55,497 --> 00:57:57,678
Jake...

744
00:57:57,713 --> 00:58:01,809
Angelika, we'll find your sisters.
All right? We'll bring them back.

745
00:58:03,025 --> 00:58:05,050
Bring back her sisters?

746
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:09,294
Bring them back?

747
00:58:09,329 --> 00:58:11,729
Bring them back with what?
Magic beans?

748
00:58:13,552 --> 00:58:16,749
- Why do you say that?
- Magic beans don't work!

749
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:21,585
They don't bring people back to life.
They did not then and they will not now.

750
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:23,840
You go wait by the horses.

751
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:26,061
Jacob, wait by the horses.

752
00:58:27,825 --> 00:58:31,693
- Sorry.
- He was doing what he thinks is right, Will.

753
00:58:31,728 --> 00:58:33,582
He was trying to help.

754
00:58:33,617 --> 00:58:37,610
- We can not fight the entire forest.
- You're just scared.

755
00:58:38,065 --> 00:58:40,206
Just scared?

756
00:58:40,241 --> 00:58:42,709
I'm terrified.
You should be too.

757
00:58:43,441 --> 00:58:47,571
Don't you understand? The idea of going
back in there - nothing makes sense there.

758
00:58:47,606 --> 00:58:50,837
It's like being inside Jake's head.

759
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:56,227
God, I hate him.
He makes me...

760
00:58:56,262 --> 00:58:58,236
He drives me mad.

761
00:58:58,961 --> 00:59:01,953
He makes you feel weak, doesn't he?

762
00:59:03,568 --> 00:59:05,900
Yeah. He always has done.

763
00:59:08,337 --> 00:59:10,703
The thing is, I can't...

764
00:59:10,738 --> 00:59:12,800
Protect him.

765
00:59:14,865 --> 00:59:19,461
My father thought
he could protect his family too, Will.

766
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:30,555
Pah!

767
00:59:30,577 --> 00:59:32,602
Jake. Jacob, come back.

768
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,347
Jake!

769
00:59:34,353 --> 00:59:36,685
Come back, Jake!

770
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:42,574
You're a fool!

771
00:59:42,609 --> 00:59:45,508
Now do you see?
I made that armor.

772
00:59:45,543 --> 00:59:48,408
It's not magic, it's just shiny.

773
00:59:51,153 --> 00:59:53,178
Oh, no!

774
00:59:55,248 --> 01:00:01,653
This lovely <i>Fräulein</i>
will not be coming with you, <i>caro</i> storyboy.

775
01:00:01,713 --> 01:00:04,473
She will be staying here with me.

776
01:00:04,508 --> 01:00:07,233
It's all right, Will.
Just go. Go.

777
01:00:16,432 --> 01:00:19,924
What's this?
It's a mess, that's what it is.

778
01:00:21,072 --> 01:00:23,632
It was hardly a snap, was it?

779
01:00:23,633 --> 01:00:27,630
More tension in the snap board.

780
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:30,989
- We need the trunks here now.
- What do you suppose I'm doing?

781
01:00:31,024 --> 01:00:34,313
And this is the last time I'll ask you,
is the chuck basket secure?

782
01:00:34,348 --> 01:00:36,351
- Yes, it's secure.
- It's secure.

783
01:00:36,386 --> 01:00:38,327
Cor!

784
01:00:39,249 --> 01:00:44,814
So, if we find these 11 girls,
we don't get guillotined.

785
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:49,616
Can you believe, these bumpkins actually
think they were devoured by the forest?

786
01:00:53,201 --> 01:00:55,328
And what exactly do we think?

787
01:01:01,392 --> 01:01:04,520
- All right. Positions, lads.
- Jake?

788
01:01:04,555 --> 01:01:07,086
- Check for takeoff.
- Jake!

789
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:09,453
- Right, you ready? Steady it.
- Jake!

790
01:01:09,488 --> 01:01:12,655
And three, two, one. Takeoff.

791
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,970
- Woo-hoo!
- No!

792
01:01:15,985 --> 01:01:17,612
Gargh! Oh!

793
01:01:19,344 --> 01:01:21,869
Jake? Jake?

794
01:01:24,752 --> 01:01:25,980
Jake?

795
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,934
Jacob?

796
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:33,422
Dammit. Every time.

797
01:01:33,457 --> 01:01:38,656
We need more height. And can we check
the alignment? The alignment is crucial.

798
01:01:38,691 --> 01:01:41,069
Stop this now, Jacob.
You're going to kill yourself.

799
01:01:41,104 --> 01:01:44,835
Oh, good. That's just great,
because then it will just be you, Will,

800
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:47,846
and you can have anything
and everything that you want.

801
01:01:47,881 --> 01:01:50,158
What is it exactly you do want, Will, huh?

802
01:01:50,193 --> 01:01:52,359
What? Is it Angelika?
You want her?

803
01:01:52,394 --> 01:01:54,190
Fine. Take her, she's yours.

804
01:01:54,225 --> 01:01:59,162
Is it the money? Take that. That's all you
seem to do these days, is take and take.

805
01:01:59,197 --> 01:02:02,219
Jacob Grimm, you petulant child!

806
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,830
Argh! Oh!

807
01:02:06,865 --> 01:02:09,026
Ow!

808
01:02:09,841 --> 01:02:13,436
What was that? Something moved.
I saw something move. Did you?

809
01:02:13,471 --> 01:02:17,319
D- d-d-don't ask.
Please don't ask me to look.

810
01:02:18,544 --> 01:02:24,813
All my life I've studied these folk tales, Will,
and now I find one that's for real.

811
01:02:24,848 --> 01:02:26,819
It's not beans.

812
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:31,805
It's real.

813
01:02:32,721 --> 01:02:35,349
I mean, don't you understand?

814
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:37,905
I have to do this.

815
01:02:41,904 --> 01:02:43,599
Ow! Agh!

816
01:02:45,424 --> 01:02:47,551
All right, Jake.

817
01:02:49,457 --> 01:02:51,982
What do you want me to do?

818
01:02:52,017 --> 01:02:54,079
What? Honestly?

819
01:02:54,992 --> 01:02:57,229
You're my brother.

820
01:02:57,264 --> 01:02:59,596
I want you to believe in me.

821
01:03:00,656 --> 01:03:02,920
I need you to help me.

822
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:08,714
All right, lads. Let's launch me off
into the flaming belly of hell.

823
01:03:08,749 --> 01:03:11,611
Wait. I think you're overcomplicating it.

824
01:03:11,646 --> 01:03:14,473
- What?
- A catapult's not gonna work.

825
01:03:14,508 --> 01:03:15,907
Yeah, you're right.

826
01:03:15,921 --> 01:03:18,048
- What other gear do we have?
- Uh...

827
01:03:18,768 --> 01:03:20,686
- Huh!
- Well, there's the...

828
01:03:20,721 --> 01:03:24,714
What about the flying-witch rig, with
a grapple and a hook to catch the window?

829
01:03:24,749 --> 01:03:26,058
- Yeah.
- Good idea.

830
01:03:26,064 --> 01:03:28,237
We haven't got a hook and grapple.

831
01:03:28,272 --> 01:03:31,762
They'll have hooks at the village.
We'll ride like the wind.

832
01:03:31,797 --> 01:03:35,252
- Will, we've got the hooks, right?
- We'll be no time at all.

833
01:03:35,287 --> 01:03:37,912
No, I've got it.

834
01:03:37,947 --> 01:03:39,429
Huh!

835
01:03:39,473 --> 01:03:41,325
Oh, great!

836
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,487
This is suicide.

837
01:03:44,785 --> 01:03:46,480
Probably.

838
01:03:47,313 --> 01:03:50,612
Bring some water, Sasha.

839
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,813
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

840
01:04:07,984 --> 01:04:10,418
Sasha.

841
01:04:10,453 --> 01:04:12,352
Sasha.

842
01:04:21,265 --> 01:04:23,392
The great Cavaldi.

843
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:28,455
Children in danger
and here he is, hiding out.

844
01:04:31,888 --> 01:04:33,287
<i>Scusa. </i>

845
01:04:37,937 --> 01:04:40,235
Ah, poor birdie.

846
01:04:46,929 --> 01:04:49,159
Huh?

847
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:16,675
What is ha..?

848
01:05:27,472 --> 01:05:29,565
- Cavaldi.
- Huh?

849
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,970
Sasha!

850
01:05:44,016 --> 01:05:46,541
Sasha, run to my voice.
Sasha, this way.

851
01:05:49,968 --> 01:05:51,731
Got you.

852
01:05:52,817 --> 01:05:54,444
Cavaldi.

853
01:05:54,448 --> 01:05:57,042
Get inside.

854
01:05:59,185 --> 01:06:00,777
It will be fine.

855
01:06:18,416 --> 01:06:19,644
I...

856
01:06:19,697 --> 01:06:21,756
I do believe I've soiled myself.

857
01:06:21,776 --> 01:06:24,438
Oh, good.
I thought it was me.

858
01:06:27,088 --> 01:06:29,989
Hm. I taste good.

859
01:06:30,352 --> 01:06:31,979
Sasha!

860
01:06:31,984 --> 01:06:35,784
Can't catch me,
I'm the gingerbread man. Ha ha!

861
01:06:35,819 --> 01:06:38,358
- Sasha!
- Sasha!

862
01:06:40,144 --> 01:06:42,271
And one...

863
01:06:46,448 --> 01:06:48,541
We're doing fine, Will.

864
01:06:53,712 --> 01:06:56,613
That's good. Steady.

865
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:02,001
Will! Come on,
keep it together down there.

866
01:07:02,036 --> 01:07:04,882
We're almost there.
Put some muscle into it.

867
01:07:04,917 --> 01:07:06,475
Life without Jake.

868
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,526
Will, concentrate.

869
01:07:08,561 --> 01:07:10,620
Only a matter of seconds now.

870
01:07:11,088 --> 01:07:14,251
That's good, Will.
Keep going.

871
01:07:37,424 --> 01:07:40,154
Hah! Oh!

872
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:41,739
Oh.

873
01:07:42,192 --> 01:07:44,301
Where was I? Oh, yes.

874
01:07:44,336 --> 01:07:47,999
Settling down.
Honest labor.

875
01:07:57,456 --> 01:07:59,481
Crypts. There's, uh...

876
01:07:59,504 --> 01:08:03,634
One, two, three, four.

877
01:08:03,669 --> 01:08:05,870
Five, six.

878
01:08:05,905 --> 01:08:09,306
Seven, eight. Nine, ten.

879
01:08:09,584 --> 01:08:11,554
Eleven, twelve.

880
01:08:11,589 --> 01:08:13,525
Uh... Will!

881
01:08:13,936 --> 01:08:17,531
Will, it's strange,
there's twelve crypts.

882
01:08:18,768 --> 01:08:22,135
And they're evenly spaced in a circle.

883
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:24,555
Yeah, it's like a clock face.

884
01:08:27,633 --> 01:08:30,124
Easy. Easy.

885
01:08:30,896 --> 01:08:33,797
All right, Will.
I'm going in, Will.

886
01:08:33,832 --> 01:08:35,871
He's going in.

887
01:08:43,888 --> 01:08:46,015
That was lucky.

888
01:09:06,641 --> 01:09:07,972
It's...

889
01:09:07,984 --> 01:09:11,215
What's this? It's a crown.

890
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:13,279
It's a...

891
01:09:16,816 --> 01:09:18,807
Oh!

892
01:09:31,024 --> 01:09:32,992
It's a book of spells.

893
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:50,989
Jake?

894
01:09:51,024 --> 01:09:53,857
It's a book of spells. Huh.

895
01:09:59,056 --> 01:10:01,547
That's the blood moon.

896
01:10:03,472 --> 01:10:05,497
Twelve crypts.

897
01:10:08,368 --> 01:10:10,495
Eleven girls.

898
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,549
I'm new at this, darling.

899
01:10:17,584 --> 01:10:23,580
If I'm doing it wrong or if there's a certain
way you like it, Grandmother Toad...

900
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:27,212
I'll just try to be gentle.

901
01:10:30,224 --> 01:10:33,216
Now show me
the way back to Angelika's house.

902
01:10:41,744 --> 01:10:43,871
Make up your mind.

903
01:10:53,807 --> 01:10:55,798
Sasha?

904
01:11:47,312 --> 01:11:50,042
For you, my queen.

905
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:10,643
Oh!

906
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:37,622
Sleep.

907
01:12:37,657 --> 01:12:38,915
Sleep.

908
01:12:44,624 --> 01:12:45,648
Jake.

909
01:12:45,712 --> 01:12:47,680
Oh.

910
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,431
Huh!

911
01:13:12,432 --> 01:13:13,330
Ha! Will!

912
01:13:41,776 --> 01:13:43,767
Jacob.

913
01:13:43,792 --> 01:13:45,316
What? Huh!

914
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,658
Jacob.

915
01:13:47,693 --> 01:13:50,465
Look at me, Jacob.

916
01:13:55,568 --> 01:13:58,125
Look at me, Jacob.

917
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:01,618
Am I still the fairest of them all?

918
01:14:03,504 --> 01:14:07,497
Tell me I am the fairest of them all.

919
01:14:07,532 --> 01:14:09,709
Jacob.

920
01:14:09,744 --> 01:14:14,738
And I will make
your dreams come true.

921
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,957
I've got you, Sasha.

922
01:14:31,856 --> 01:14:34,984
What do you desire, Jacob?

923
01:14:36,304 --> 01:14:39,038
Fame?

924
01:14:39,073 --> 01:14:41,773
Power?

925
01:14:42,576 --> 01:14:45,511
Angelika?

926
01:14:47,695 --> 01:14:49,492
You love her,

927
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,618
not him.

928
01:14:54,831 --> 01:14:57,231
He doesn't love her.

929
01:14:59,056 --> 01:15:03,015
Not like you, Jacob.

930
01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:04,919
Jake!

931
01:15:05,391 --> 01:15:07,382
Jake!

932
01:15:10,383 --> 01:15:12,283
- Argh!
- Oh!

933
01:15:12,688 --> 01:15:17,216
Jacob Grimm, you bedwetting piss bucket!

934
01:15:20,847 --> 01:15:23,117
Ha ha!

935
01:15:23,152 --> 01:15:24,642
Look at me, Jacob.

936
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:26,893
No, no. Don't look at her.

937
01:15:26,928 --> 01:15:31,024
Jacob. Jacob.
Look at me, Jacob. Jacob!

938
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:39,381
Rapunzel!

939
01:15:46,384 --> 01:15:49,133
Good timing. Nice disguise.

940
01:15:49,168 --> 01:15:52,763
She's still there, Will.
She's still alive. She's up in the tower.

941
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:56,178
- For 500 years?
- Yeah, but they haven't been kind.

942
01:15:56,213 --> 01:15:58,445
- Grab the ax.
- Huh? Right.

943
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:01,101
They tricked her, Will.
They tricked her.

944
01:16:01,136 --> 01:16:05,136
Because she has the spell for eternal life,
but not for youth, not youth.

945
01:16:05,171 --> 01:16:09,137
So she'll rot for eternity, waiting for
someone to come and rescue her.

946
01:16:09,172 --> 01:16:11,917
- Come on.
- Was that Sasha?

947
01:16:11,952 --> 01:16:14,124
- It's this way, Will.
- No, no, it's not.

948
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:17,151
- It's that way. Grandmother Toad told me.
- What?

949
01:16:17,186 --> 01:16:19,902
Trust the toad!

950
01:16:19,937 --> 01:16:21,880
Come on!

951
01:16:22,639 --> 01:16:24,732
Stand aside, Will.

952
01:16:37,584 --> 01:16:40,553
It's the ax, Will.
It's enchanted as well.

953
01:16:40,588 --> 01:16:42,545
Stop them!

954
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:44,503
Jacob!

955
01:16:51,695 --> 01:16:53,822
To the horses. Run!

956
01:17:02,703 --> 01:17:06,104
Stop them!

957
01:17:10,383 --> 01:17:12,461
Sasha!

958
01:17:12,496 --> 01:17:15,021
Sasha! Sasha.

959
01:17:18,096 --> 01:17:19,563
She's not breathing.

960
01:17:19,568 --> 01:17:24,130
- How can she not be breathing?
- It's impossible. I saw her walk.

961
01:17:24,165 --> 01:17:27,349
There's no breath.
No pulse.

962
01:17:27,696 --> 01:17:30,563
- Sasha.
- Cursed forever!

963
01:17:31,376 --> 01:17:36,006
They shall all perish
beneath the blood moon.

964
01:17:36,559 --> 01:17:38,925
The drawings. The spells.

965
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:42,760
The blood moon comes tonight.

966
01:17:46,575 --> 01:17:49,567
It has to do with the eclipse.

967
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:51,532
It has to do with the eclipse.

968
01:17:51,567 --> 01:17:55,162
Listen to me.
We know why your forest is enchanted.

969
01:17:55,197 --> 01:17:59,149
It's under the power of
the Thuringian queen.

970
01:17:59,184 --> 01:18:02,051
She's stolen your girls for their youth,
for their beauty.

971
01:18:02,086 --> 01:18:04,726
She needs twelve.
Sasha was meant to be the twelfth.

972
01:18:04,761 --> 01:18:07,308
The queen needs one more
to make her spell work.

973
01:18:07,343 --> 01:18:11,803
You're right. Clear out these children.
Get them to Malsburg or Frankfurt.

974
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:17,813
Leave before the eclipse.

975
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:20,429
Listen!

976
01:18:42,032 --> 01:18:44,967
People of Marbaden,

977
01:18:45,002 --> 01:18:47,116
citizens of France,

978
01:18:47,151 --> 01:18:53,681
all honor and glory be
to General Vavarin Delatombe.

979
01:18:55,247 --> 01:18:59,581
He rides to the aid of his people.

980
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:03,128
<i>Où est Cavaldi?</i>

981
01:19:03,152 --> 01:19:05,916
<i>Generale! Generale!</i>

982
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:08,808
<i>Generale!</i>

983
01:19:09,743 --> 01:19:13,144
<i>Ecco Cavaldi!</i>

984
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:22,009
What are you wearing?

985
01:19:22,044 --> 01:19:24,269
Ah, this.

986
01:19:24,304 --> 01:19:26,704
Precautionary measure.

987
01:19:27,375 --> 01:19:28,569
<i>Generale. </i>

988
01:19:28,591 --> 01:19:33,119
All is well. Everything is in the hands
of your most devoted...

989
01:19:33,154 --> 01:19:35,372
Argh!

990
01:19:35,407 --> 01:19:37,068
If all is well,

991
01:19:37,104 --> 01:19:41,473
why were two compatriots of these men
arrested on the road to Malsburg?

992
01:19:44,751 --> 01:19:46,828
And why would they not stop telling tales

993
01:19:46,863 --> 01:19:51,046
of extraordinary occurrences
in the Thuringian Forest,

994
01:19:51,081 --> 01:19:55,230
spreading superstition and rumors
amongst my troops?

995
01:19:55,265 --> 01:19:58,179
These Grimms are thieves and liars.

996
01:19:58,576 --> 01:20:01,511
Every demon they have killed
they have created.

997
01:20:01,546 --> 01:20:03,947
- No, no, that's not true.
- That's a lie.

998
01:20:03,982 --> 01:20:06,184
But I have confessions.

999
01:20:11,152 --> 01:20:14,952
- Arrest them.
- <i>Baissez-le! Baissez-le!</i>

1000
01:20:15,152 --> 01:20:16,585
<i>Vite. Vite!</i>

1001
01:20:22,031 --> 01:20:24,751
You see?
You German people,

1002
01:20:24,786 --> 01:20:27,471
what you think of as heroes.

1003
01:20:28,143 --> 01:20:31,116
New citizens of France,

1004
01:20:31,151 --> 01:20:33,779
vanquish your darkest fears.

1005
01:20:34,319 --> 01:20:36,845
Burn the forest.

1006
01:20:40,656 --> 01:20:42,647
And with it...

1007
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:45,071
the Brothers Grimm.

1008
01:20:56,655 --> 01:20:58,782
Adieu, Grimm.

1009
01:20:59,087 --> 01:21:01,927
And farewell to your tales.

1010
01:21:01,962 --> 01:21:04,768
They will not be remembered.

1011
01:21:07,247 --> 01:21:08,612
Burn them.

1012
01:21:13,039 --> 01:21:15,837
I, uh, sorry.

1013
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:19,927
Bye.

1014
01:21:38,607 --> 01:21:41,098
Elsie! Elsie!

1015
01:21:45,327 --> 01:21:47,488
- Jacob.
- Will.

1016
01:21:48,047 --> 01:21:50,015
Fire.

1017
01:22:04,432 --> 01:22:05,831
Bingo.

1018
01:22:14,288 --> 01:22:16,256
Will.

1019
01:22:16,291 --> 01:22:18,036
Angelika!

1020
01:22:20,207 --> 01:22:22,732
The feet. The feet.

1021
01:22:28,559 --> 01:22:30,959
Where did you find this?
Where did you find it?

1022
01:22:36,911 --> 01:22:39,880
- Run, Jake.
- Wait. My book. My book!

1023
01:22:39,915 --> 01:22:42,383
Forget the book, Jacob! Run!

1024
01:22:44,271 --> 01:22:47,445
This is the life, eh, Cavaldi?

1025
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:50,261
To be victorious in the field,

1026
01:22:50,296 --> 01:22:53,043
with one's troops around you,

1027
01:22:54,063 --> 01:22:57,260
enjoying a simple meal,

1028
01:22:57,295 --> 01:22:59,861
a soldier's meal,

1029
01:23:01,391 --> 01:23:04,087
by firelight.

1030
01:23:04,122 --> 01:23:06,038
Romantic, huh?

1031
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:11,360
Wait!

1032
01:23:44,176 --> 01:23:45,768
Father?

1033
01:23:47,087 --> 01:23:49,214
Where have you been?

1034
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:57,096
Cold. So cold.

1035
01:23:58,671 --> 01:24:02,664
Come to me, my frozen prince.

1036
01:24:02,699 --> 01:24:04,433
Be mine...

1037
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:08,321
...now and forever...

1038
01:24:09,967 --> 01:24:11,798
...in love.

1039
01:24:13,775 --> 01:24:16,471
- No!
- Angelika.

1040
01:24:20,591 --> 01:24:24,083
- It's my father.
- Stop looking. He was trying to kill you.

1041
01:24:24,118 --> 01:24:25,674
Jake!

1042
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:45,743
Angelika!

1043
01:24:50,895 --> 01:24:53,159
Angelika.

1044
01:24:55,343 --> 01:24:57,311
Angelika!

1045
01:25:02,607 --> 01:25:04,700
Will, Angelika's the twelfth.

1046
01:25:08,175 --> 01:25:10,336
The twelfth.

1047
01:25:42,415 --> 01:25:44,542
What the devil?

1048
01:25:47,215 --> 01:25:49,740
What kind of magic, huh?

1049
01:25:50,607 --> 01:25:53,235
What tricks?

1050
01:25:53,615 --> 01:25:56,778
Where are you going?
Come back here!

1051
01:25:57,039 --> 01:26:00,975
You, stand your ground.
That is an order!

1052
01:26:01,010 --> 01:26:03,507
I command you. You traitors!

1053
01:26:06,511 --> 01:26:08,638
Come back here!

1054
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:11,490
Argh!

1055
01:26:13,359 --> 01:26:15,935
<i>Generale. Generale. </i>

1056
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:18,511
Grimmy. <i>Miracolo!</i>

1057
01:26:23,791 --> 01:26:25,918
How is this possible?

1058
01:26:31,151 --> 01:26:33,244
Run, Will.

1059
01:26:51,663 --> 01:26:53,995
Sleep well, princess.

1060
01:27:26,127 --> 01:27:29,585
It's started, Will.
It's started.

1061
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:35,307
- Yes.
- The blood of the twelfth, my queen.

1062
01:27:44,911 --> 01:27:47,345
Wake up, please.
Will, push!

1063
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:49,040
I am.

1064
01:27:49,359 --> 01:27:52,419
Will, try the magic ax.
Try the ax!

1065
01:27:53,743 --> 01:27:55,438
Ha!

1066
01:27:59,023 --> 01:28:01,924
Give me that.
Back, back!

1067
01:28:06,863 --> 01:28:11,527
- I held the ax the same way you do.
- Concentrate on getting up in the tower.

1068
01:28:11,562 --> 01:28:12,906
I don't have time...

1069
01:28:18,383 --> 01:28:20,851
- We found the missing girls.
- They're in the crypts.

1070
01:28:20,886 --> 01:28:23,793
I mean, they're in the crypts.

1071
01:28:23,828 --> 01:28:26,700
Grimms, story time is over.

1072
01:28:27,311 --> 01:28:31,407
- Execute them.
- No, no. That's who you want. Up there.

1073
01:28:31,442 --> 01:28:33,720
I said execute them.

1074
01:28:45,103 --> 01:28:47,915
<i>Generale</i>.

1075
01:28:47,950 --> 01:28:51,317
I wish to resign my...

1076
01:28:56,911 --> 01:28:59,903
Resignation accepted.

1077
01:29:01,263 --> 01:29:04,994
Italian never agrees with me.

1078
01:29:06,575 --> 01:29:08,406
Mild indigestion.

1079
01:29:10,159 --> 01:29:12,457
It will soon pass.

1080
01:29:17,071 --> 01:29:20,165
Is this one of your tricks, Grimms, huh?

1081
01:29:25,167 --> 01:29:27,260
- Run, Will.
- Jake?

1082
01:29:30,703 --> 01:29:33,103
Be a soldier!

1083
01:29:46,063 --> 01:29:49,464
How dare you insult my general?

1084
01:30:05,135 --> 01:30:07,865
Die, barbarian.

1085
01:30:18,542 --> 01:30:21,102
Heagh!

1086
01:30:32,238 --> 01:30:34,672
Oh, wait. No. Oh!

1087
01:30:40,783 --> 01:30:42,011
Huh!

1088
01:30:42,575 --> 01:30:45,135
- Bingo.
- You killed my friends.

1089
01:30:45,422 --> 01:30:47,947
I only wish you had more.

1090
01:30:49,327 --> 01:30:51,955
Still, there is always your brother, hm?

1091
01:30:54,607 --> 01:30:56,802
Where is Jacob, by the way?

1092
01:31:16,559 --> 01:31:18,424
Beg.

1093
01:31:18,447 --> 01:31:20,176
Argh!

1094
01:31:20,207 --> 01:31:22,266
No!

1095
01:31:26,446 --> 01:31:28,744
I want you to beg.

1096
01:31:32,206 --> 01:31:34,764
Oh, God, no, no.

1097
01:31:34,799 --> 01:31:38,826
Brave general, don't kill me.

1098
01:31:38,861 --> 01:31:40,565
Argh!

1099
01:31:46,862 --> 01:31:50,345
All I wanted was a little order.

1100
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:53,828
A slice of quiche would be nice.

1101
01:32:09,967 --> 01:32:14,904
Soon we shall be one, my love.

1102
01:32:25,935 --> 01:32:27,788
Ah!

1103
01:32:27,823 --> 01:32:30,587
- Yes.
- My queen.

1104
01:32:35,055 --> 01:32:36,716
Stop!

1105
01:32:38,287 --> 01:32:39,845
- Huh!
- No.

1106
01:32:39,855 --> 01:32:43,484
Finish the spell, my love.

1107
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:53,978
Agh!

1108
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:04,108
Argh!

1109
01:33:32,174 --> 01:33:34,267
Where am I?

1110
01:33:41,999 --> 01:33:43,580
I'm exhausted.

1111
01:33:43,615 --> 01:33:45,161
Stop her, Will.

1112
01:33:48,367 --> 01:33:51,063
No. Not the knife, Will.
Not the knife!

1113
01:34:04,367 --> 01:34:06,460
She's got control of them.

1114
01:34:08,238 --> 01:34:13,870
When the moon again becomes full,
so will I.

1115
01:34:14,191 --> 01:34:20,460
And your kingdom will once again be mine.

1116
01:34:30,062 --> 01:34:32,929
- You can stop her, Jake.
- I can't, Will.

1117
01:34:37,839 --> 01:34:40,465
This is your world, Jake.
It's just you.

1118
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:43,091
- Finish the story.
- Yes!

1119
01:34:43,126 --> 01:34:45,351
I don't know how.

1120
01:34:47,694 --> 01:34:51,289
Am I beautiful?

1121
01:34:53,327 --> 01:34:55,318
I can't hold on.
I can't hold on.

1122
01:34:57,423 --> 01:35:00,236
Ah!

1123
01:35:00,271 --> 01:35:03,787
Who's the fairest of them all now?

1124
01:35:03,822 --> 01:35:06,313
- You can stop it, you know the story.
- No, I'm weak.

1125
01:35:06,319 --> 01:35:08,287
- It's you. It's you.
- I can't.

1126
01:35:13,903 --> 01:35:14,892
Oh!

1127
01:35:16,910 --> 01:35:18,741
Will. Will!

1128
01:35:24,526 --> 01:35:26,517
Will, Will.

1129
01:35:28,526 --> 01:35:29,959
Argh!

1130
01:35:29,967 --> 01:35:32,094
I'm sorry.

1131
01:35:32,943 --> 01:35:36,401
Come here. All right, now.
All right, Will.

1132
01:35:36,436 --> 01:35:38,665
Um... OK.

1133
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:40,894
All right.

1134
01:35:46,830 --> 01:35:49,958
Such brotherly love.

1135
01:35:50,831 --> 01:35:54,251
- Such sacrifice.
- Will. Will.

1136
01:35:54,286 --> 01:35:57,187
Don't look her in the eyes.
Don't look her in the eyes.

1137
01:35:57,222 --> 01:36:00,865
- He's dying, Jacob.
- Leave him alone!

1138
01:36:02,415 --> 01:36:04,542
Because of you.

1139
01:36:06,222 --> 01:36:09,356
Can you save him?

1140
01:36:09,391 --> 01:36:12,656
Do you have your magic beans?

1141
01:36:15,662 --> 01:36:19,189
Because I do.

1142
01:36:36,207 --> 01:36:42,146
What a beautiful bedtime story this will be.

1143
01:36:42,735 --> 01:36:45,355
Did you not know, Jacob?

1144
01:36:45,390 --> 01:36:50,657
Truth is much more terrible than fiction.

1145
01:36:51,375 --> 01:36:52,672
Will.

1146
01:36:53,999 --> 01:36:56,524
Do you want to live?

1147
01:36:59,726 --> 01:37:01,353
No.

1148
01:37:01,358 --> 01:37:03,383
No, my queen.

1149
01:37:04,270 --> 01:37:06,397
Oh, no. No, my queen.

1150
01:37:12,174 --> 01:37:14,734
I am here.

1151
01:37:23,438 --> 01:37:29,104
Complete the spell, my sweet new prince.

1152
01:37:30,286 --> 01:37:35,690
Mirror, mirror on the wall...

1153
01:37:38,511 --> 01:37:40,638
Say it.

1154
01:37:40,687 --> 01:37:42,909
You are the fairest of them all.

1155
01:37:42,944 --> 01:37:45,132
No! Don't kiss her!

1156
01:37:59,694 --> 01:38:01,218
So cold.

1157
01:38:04,494 --> 01:38:07,292
Look what you have done!

1158
01:38:11,790 --> 01:38:14,258
Angelika?

1159
01:38:15,310 --> 01:38:17,790
You killed my daughters!

1160
01:38:17,825 --> 01:38:20,429
- My queen.
- Stop him!

1161
01:38:20,464 --> 01:38:23,034
- You must die!
- Stop him!

1162
01:38:23,069 --> 01:38:25,515
No, Will. No!

1163
01:38:25,550 --> 01:38:27,181
Argh!

1164
01:38:28,239 --> 01:38:30,571
Who is the fairest of them all?

1165
01:38:32,079 --> 01:38:34,741
No!

1166
01:38:40,078 --> 01:38:42,092
Grimmy.

1167
01:38:42,127 --> 01:38:44,254
Signor Grimmy.

1168
01:38:45,166 --> 01:38:48,158
Please. No, please.

1169
01:38:49,359 --> 01:38:52,089
Tell me what to do.

1170
01:38:53,102 --> 01:38:55,297
Serve my queen.

1171
01:38:56,175 --> 01:38:58,905
No. Grimmy?

1172
01:39:02,510 --> 01:39:06,310
Demon queen, hear me.

1173
01:39:07,534 --> 01:39:14,940
Swallow my curse from
the dark heart of my ancestors.

1174
01:39:17,108 --> 01:39:19,171
<i>Maledetta. </i>

1175
01:39:21,487 --> 01:39:23,148
<i>Maledetta!</i>

1176
01:40:13,006 --> 01:40:15,133
Hello!

1177
01:40:17,646 --> 01:40:21,639
Can anybody hear me?

1178
01:40:22,575 --> 01:40:24,566
Hello!

1179
01:40:27,566 --> 01:40:29,534
Hello.

1180
01:40:38,958 --> 01:40:40,949
Jacob!

1181
01:40:42,510 --> 01:40:46,537
Jacob, it is I, Cavaldi.

1182
01:40:46,572 --> 01:40:48,437
Jacob.

1183
01:40:49,390 --> 01:40:50,880
Where's Will?

1184
01:40:51,726 --> 01:40:53,717
Will.

1185
01:40:57,326 --> 01:40:59,817
Oh, God, Will.

1186
01:40:59,822 --> 01:41:03,258
No. God, no.

1187
01:41:17,070 --> 01:41:19,019
Wait.

1188
01:41:19,054 --> 01:41:22,153
I know this story,

1189
01:41:22,188 --> 01:41:25,252
from my childhood.

1190
01:41:26,094 --> 01:41:28,585
There is still time, Jacob.

1191
01:41:28,590 --> 01:41:30,475
Look.

1192
01:41:30,510 --> 01:41:32,637
See? Hurry, Jacob.

1193
01:41:32,654 --> 01:41:35,787
The spell can be broken with a kiss...

1194
01:41:35,822 --> 01:41:39,918
- Yes, a kiss. A kiss, yes.
... of true love.

1195
01:41:43,054 --> 01:41:47,718
Make sure, in your heart, true love.

1196
01:41:49,550 --> 01:41:54,954
Or the kiss will be the kiss of death.

1197
01:42:39,598 --> 01:42:41,828
Yes.

1198
01:42:49,934 --> 01:42:52,801
- Eva!
- Heidi!

1199
01:42:52,836 --> 01:42:54,183
Bingo!

1200
01:42:54,190 --> 01:42:56,090
- Lily!
- Elsie!

1201
01:42:56,125 --> 01:42:58,411
Angelika!

1202
01:42:58,446 --> 01:43:01,347
- Will.
- Hurry, <i>bambini</i>. Hurry.

1203
01:43:06,350 --> 01:43:09,808
Will. Come on, it's over now.
You can get up.

1204
01:43:09,843 --> 01:43:12,072
Will, the spell's broken.

1205
01:43:12,430 --> 01:43:14,155
Will?

1206
01:43:14,190 --> 01:43:16,317
We did it.

1207
01:43:17,806 --> 01:43:19,797
Will?

1208
01:43:21,454 --> 01:43:22,512
Will.

1209
01:43:22,542 --> 01:43:25,602
Perhaps another kiss.

1210
01:43:30,510 --> 01:43:33,570
Not you.

1211
01:43:34,542 --> 01:43:36,510
Hm?

1212
01:43:39,086 --> 01:43:41,520
Maybe you should give it a try, Angelika.

1213
01:43:57,582 --> 01:44:01,313
I just had to know what that was like
before the story ended.

1214
01:44:01,348 --> 01:44:01,787
Will!

1215
01:44:15,918 --> 01:44:20,218
Good people of Marbaden,
you have nothing further to fear,

1216
01:44:20,253 --> 01:44:23,531
because I and the Grimmies,

1217
01:44:23,566 --> 01:44:28,902
we have destroyed the dark heart of evil.

1218
01:44:28,937 --> 01:44:31,179
You are free!

1219
01:44:31,214 --> 01:44:33,876
<i>Grazie! Musica!</i>

1220
01:44:40,622 --> 01:44:44,319
I would like to keep this.
It saved my life.

1221
01:44:44,354 --> 01:44:45,862
- Of course.
- <i>Grazie. </i>

1222
01:44:45,902 --> 01:44:49,163
And this, you should be
more careful about this.

1223
01:44:49,198 --> 01:44:53,191
- It's very good, but I think it'll...
- Is that mine?

1224
01:45:01,710 --> 01:45:06,613
- Sorry I never believed in you.
- Well, I never believed in you either.

1225
01:45:06,648 --> 01:45:08,605
So you <i>are</i> brothers.

1226
01:45:15,310 --> 01:45:21,306
You're welcome here any time,
any time at all, Grimms. This is your home.

1227
01:45:23,534 --> 01:45:26,833
- I thought you ended up with the girl.
- You see that?

1228
01:45:26,868 --> 01:45:28,459
What? The sun?

1229
01:45:28,494 --> 01:45:30,655
- The day's not over yet.
- Yeah, right!

1230
01:45:35,341 --> 01:45:39,004
- Would you call this a turning point?
- I'd say we're on the verge.

1231
01:45:39,039 --> 01:45:40,654
- Really?
- The verge, Will.

1232
01:45:40,689 --> 01:45:42,475
That's fantastic.

1233
01:45:42,510 --> 01:45:45,231
Cos I've been thinking
of an alternative career path.

1234
01:45:45,266 --> 01:45:47,883
- One that uses all of our new expertise.
- Will.

1235
01:45:47,918 --> 01:45:50,822
- I haven't sorted it yet...
- Will, this is the real world.

1236
01:45:50,857 --> 01:45:53,727
We're men without a country,
we're enemies of the state,

1237
01:45:53,762 --> 01:45:55,915
and worst of all we haven't a single bean.

1238
01:45:55,950 --> 01:45:59,647
- It's a good name, though, isn't it?
- It's a damn good name.

1239
01:45:59,682 --> 01:46:01,693
Let's dance. Come on.

1240
