1
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:07,988
Give me your press badge.

2
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,185
No way, you're not my dad!

3
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:12,796
Then I shall take it by force.

4
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,763
He's my brother!

5
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:16,731
Then you shouldn't have
made out with him.

6
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:08,219
So, your name's Dan?

7
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:12,222
Yeah, Dan... Dan Quint.
Like on the resume.

8
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:15,884
Dan Quint. Born 1990.
I didn't think that was possible.

9
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,359
Yeah, 1990.

10
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,293
People are born every year.

11
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:24,028
What do you hope to get out of being
in the mailroom, Dan?

12
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,196
I guess I hope to get out of
being in the mailroom.

13
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:30,674
You got sass. I like it.

14
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:32,868
Guess what? You're hired.

15
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,640
I'm Lemuel Gulliver.
Welcome to the team.

16
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:37,783
I was hired...

17
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:39,941
yesterday by HR.

18
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,882
- Doggy wants a bone.
- What?

19
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,750
Doggy wants a bone.

20
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,284
Floor 30. This is the editors' floor.

21
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,553
Oh, yeah.
This is the epicenter, my friend.

22
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,492
- Feel it. Feel it.
- Okay.

23
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:52,995
Got a little something for you.

24
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,091
God dang it! Sorry about that.

25
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,498
I will dry-clean that.
Sorry about that. My bad.

26
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,767
- Just wait out here.
- What?

27
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,498
One second.

28
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,000
Here's your mail, sir.

29
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,908
Hey, you're Harold Jones, right?

30
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,605
Yeah.

31
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:12,376
I loved your piece
on the failure of derivative markets.

32
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:13,519
Thanks very much.

33
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,176
I look forward to seeing you around.

34
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,686
Thank you...

35
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,450
from me and all the readers.

36
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:23,353
Dan, what are you doing?
You can't talk to those guys!

37
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:24,553
Why not?

38
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,063
Okay, this is your first day.
We are the mailroom guys.

39
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,793
Mailroom guys are meant
to be seen and not heard.

40
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,869
And ideally, not even seen, okay?

41
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,801
We're not on their level.
We're little people.

42
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,873
No, I think you're
just scared to talk to them.

43
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:39,569
I am not! Dude, listen.
I am just respectful of their workspace.

44
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,146
I talk to these people all the...

45
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:51,554
I'll let you know as soon as
I've made a decision, Nigel.

46
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:54,056
Okey-dokey, thank you.
Good day, fellas.

47
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:55,789
- Good day.
- Good day, mate.

48
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,691
Gulliver, got any mail for me?

49
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,798
Yeah... No... Maybe.

50
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:00,990
Let me check.

51
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,397
- Hi, I'm Dan, from the mailroom.
- Hey. Darcy.

52
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,367
And I'll do whatever it takes
to not be from the mailroom.

53
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:09,607
Dan doesn't need to be bothering
her right now. She's busy.

54
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:10,640
He isn't bothering me.

55
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,505
I love to have a reason
to procrastinate.

56
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,078
Yeah, me, too.

57
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,011
You're not bugging me.
There you go.

58
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,673
Well, I'll see you guys later.

59
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,284
- Good to see you.
- Okay.

60
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,351
Oh, boy. Let's go.

61
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,958
So, how long have you had this
debilitating crush on the travel editor?

62
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,186
Crush? On Darcy? No way, dude.

63
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:31,830
First of all, you're a terrible liar.

64
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,898
Second of all,
why don't you just ask her out?

65
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,035
- You don't think I could ask her out?
- No.

66
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,568
I could ask her out whenever,
wherever. It's no problem.

67
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,707
It would take me five seconds.
"Will you go out with me?" "Yes. " Done.

68
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:44,672
I'm now going out with Darcy Silverman.
We are boyfriend and girlfriend.

69
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,607
"Gulliver and Darcy?"
"Cutest couple ever. "

70
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,942
Okay. So, then, do it.

71
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,776
Next time I see her, I will.

72
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,680
Hold on! Hi, again.

73
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,478
Hey, Darcy.

74
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:59,056
I just remembered,
I get claustrophobic in elevators.

75
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,557
- How is your day going?
- Really good.

76
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:09,963
Just really, really, good.

77
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,468
- What are you doing this weekend?
- So much stuff.

78
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:15,368
It's just going to be... a bunch of stuff.

79
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,634
- Cool.
- Yeah, it's cool.

80
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,183
- Have a good one.
- You, too.

81
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,880
Wait! I forgot something.

82
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,719
Yeah, me, too.

83
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:47,470
So?

84
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,235
Yeah?

85
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,604
Yeah!

86
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,172
You chickened out, didn't you?

87
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,939
I wasn't... I just... You know...
I didn't chicken out.

88
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:00,312
- Being respectful of her workspace.
- Exactly.

89
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,248
Dude.

90
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,979
Speaking of which, after work...

91
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,353
do you want to go for a couple
of brews and shoot some poos?

92
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:07,993
Maybe a little man-date.

93
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:11,358
I don't think so. Especially because
you called it a man-date.

94
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,123
I got you. You want a rain check.

95
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:16,632
You want to wake up all bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed for the boss.

96
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,195
You're not my boss anymore.

97
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,532
What are you talking about?

98
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,768
I just got promoted.

99
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,176
That's impossible. You just got here.

100
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:29,041
Yeah, they promoted me...

101
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,149
to head of the mailroom.

102
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,807
So I'm your boss now.

103
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:40,321
Look, Gulliver, the reason you didn't
ask her out and you never will...

104
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:43,324
is the same reason that you're
not going to leave the mailroom.

105
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,124
You've been here 10 years, man.

106
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:50,563
You peaked.

107
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,870
You talk a big game
and that can be fun sometimes.

108
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:58,807
And you're pretty funny around the office,
but that's all you are.

109
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,240
It's just talk.

110
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,040
So you might as well face it...

111
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,683
you're never really going to
get any bigger than this.

112
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:12,289
These talks. This is the worst part
about being a boss.

113
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:15,257
Anyway, be in tomorrow at 7:00.

114
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,191
We're going to sort of
change things up...

115
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:20,799
and we're gonna start with getting rid
of "Guitar Hero" during work hours.

116
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:32,738
Night, Darcy.

117
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,013
See you.

118
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:50,958
Gulliver?

119
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:54,256
Hi.

120
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,427
Hi.

121
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:57,626
Can I help you?

122
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,762
Yeah, L...

123
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,899
I wanted to see...

124
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,769
if you wanted to...

125
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:12,743
You seem a little nervous.
Are you all right?

126
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,443
No, I'm fine. I'm just...

127
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:16,747
I got so much going on.

128
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,823
I wanted to pick this up,
and then I'm on my way.

129
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:21,391
You want to apply for
a travel writing assignment?

130
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,094
Yeah. Exactly.

131
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,756
I had no idea you wrote or traveled.

132
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,870
I do. I travel a lot.
I go to New Zealand.

133
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:35,337
Been to Mexico.
Méjico, they call it...

134
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:36,839
in the locals.

135
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,499
Africa, the Congo.

136
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:42,170
Which I know is in Africa
because I travel and write.

137
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,343
So this is kind of what I want to do.

138
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,749
Why don't you bring in a writing sample
tomorrow and I'll see what I can do.

139
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,779
Perfect.

140
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,654
- Okay.
- Okay.

141
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,754
Hey, Gulliver.

142
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,490
Nice job putting yourself out there.

143
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:01,394
Yeah. Cool. Okay, bye-bye.

144
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:02,829
Bye-bye.

145
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,548
I should've just manned up
and asked her out.

146
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,155
Now she's expecting a writing sample?
What was I thinking?

147
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:27,656
I saw some things
In different lands

148
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,899
Karate chop... I gotta write this thing!

149
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,305
No, I got nothing.

150
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,062
I am so impressed, Gulliver.

151
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,605
I had no idea
you were such a good writer.

152
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:20,405
I kind of keep it secret. I don't like
to brag about my more literarian side.

153
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:21,671
These samples are terrific.

154
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,281
And you exhibit such variety.

155
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,250
This one about Oaxaca feels really classic,
like it came straight out of Frommer's...

156
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,616
whereas the description
of Barcelona is all...

157
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,088
sassy.

158
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,920
It's like I'm reading Time Out.

159
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,225
Yeah.

160
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:40,263
I think I have the perfect fluff piece
to start you off with.

161
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:43,698
There's a guy down in Bermuda who claims
he has the secret to the Bermuda Triangle.

162
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,702
He's either crazy or he's trying
to bilk tourists. But I figure...

163
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,965
it could be a fun way in...

164
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,939
to explore Bermuda
and the smaller islands around it.

165
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,772
You do have boat experience, don't you?

166
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:57,404
I'm a... boat... man.

167
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,607
I'm a boatman.

168
00:11:58,784 --> 00:11:59,978
Okay, good...

169
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,449
because I have to be honest,
it was hard to find someone to do this.

170
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:06,557
You have to be at sea for three weeks,
completely off the grid.

171
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,023
That's okay with you, right?

172
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,320
Good, because I thought...

173
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,987
I was going to have to do it
and I get super seasick. It's crazy.

174
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:15,255
So, what do you say?

175
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:18,627
It's not a big story, but it's a start.

176
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,466
So, the Bermuda Triangle, huh?

177
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:26,076
Everything I need
to know is in here?

178
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,440
It is. Your contact's been arranged...

179
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,639
and there's a boat waiting for you.

180
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:32,485
Yeah.

181
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:52,501
That's me!

182
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:56,973
Okay, precious cargo! No, no, no!

183
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,610
That was close.

184
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,613
All you chickens,
get out of the road, man!

185
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,781
I don't know about this, Hank.

186
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,283
I mean, are you sure this is safe?

187
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,423
All this Bermuda Triangle talk
is just to sell T-shirts to tourists.

188
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,682
It makes for good stories...

189
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:16,123
if you want to skeet-skeet
with the girls on the mainland.

190
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,785
This is your boat.

191
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,525
Knotfersail.

192
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,461
They really went pun-tastic
on that boat.

193
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,295
The dock master's really into puns.

194
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,063
He believes it keeps the pirates away.

195
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:28,502
Ship Happens.

196
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:31,142
This is you, and the dot
is your destination.

197
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,074
You just follow that dot,
and you'll find yourself in a triangle.

198
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:35,543
- In the Bermuda Triangle?
- Yeah.

199
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:37,807
And then to come home,
you say I turn this knob...

200
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,416
and I follow the dot back home?

201
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:40,516
Yeah.

202
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:41,880
- Easy.
- Easy.

203
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:43,180
- Done.
- Done.

204
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,845
I've got it.

205
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,127
I am fine.

206
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,058
Fine.

207
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:56,033
It's not moving.
Okay, where's the clutch?

208
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:04,474
And as you go out to the ocean water...

209
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:07,237
towards the Bermuda Triangle...

210
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:11,179
there's reflections everywhere.
I should've brought some sunglasses.

211
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,875
I am as hungry as a horse.

212
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,884
I could eat 1,000 cheeseburgers.

213
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,283
Okay.

214
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,618
Quitting time.

215
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:24,751
Yeah.

216
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,190
How to build your own robot?

217
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,703
Yeah, that's going to happen.

218
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:55,787
Darcy.

219
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,797
Cheeseburger.

220
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:02,729
Darcy.

221
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,900
Cheeseburger.

222
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:31,461
No!

223
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,666
Safety! Okay.

224
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,333
Rubber ducky.

225
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,374
No!

226
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,142
Floaties! Floatie one.

227
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:48,974
Floatie leg, floatie left...

228
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,172
floatie right, floatie head.

229
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,276
I am safe!

230
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:53,777
There is no...

231
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,619
9-1-1.

232
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,652
Oh, no.

233
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,106
Oh, God, help me!

234
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,589
I'm paralyzed from the neck down.

235
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,856
What's that crawling on me?

236
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:43,399
Not fire ants.
Please don't be fire ants.

237
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:49,105
I am General Edward Edwardian,
Commander of Lilliput.

238
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:50,605
All hail Lilliput!

239
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,243
All hail Lilliput!

240
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:56,745
You are herewith charged with aiding
our sworn enemy, the Blefuscians.

241
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:02,110
You are my prisoner, and shall be presented
to our Royal Highness, King Theodore.

242
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,754
What say you...

243
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,182
beast?

244
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,373
You are not real!
Where is my...?

245
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,537
Where am I?

246
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,614
This must be a dream.

247
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:35,609
I'm gonna close my eyes, then I'm gonna
open them, and I'll be home in bed.

248
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,279
Okay! Okay!

249
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:40,884
My spear!

250
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,493
Bring the beast down!

251
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,929
All right, boys! Release the hookers.

252
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,234
Pull, pull!

253
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,729
Hey!

254
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:54,668
Pull!

255
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,307
Hey, not cool.

256
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,602
Hey, that's my pants. That's not funny!

257
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,342
Unlucky.

258
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,829
Heave!

259
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,459
Heave!

260
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,866
It was awful, horrid! Nightmarish!

261
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,701
I was trapped in the valley
of violent rumbles.

262
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,536
I was nauseous!

263
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:10,745
Lift!

264
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,077
Squad, halt!

265
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,521
This giant is hereby declared...

266
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,920
the property of
His Majesty King Theodore.

267
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,323
All hail King Theodore!

268
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,554
All hail King Theodore!

269
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:35,029
I wanted a bracelet,
not a great big hairy beast.

270
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:42,875
Oh, dear!
Are those restraints really necessary?

271
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:46,108
They are, my innocent,
naive little bunny tail.

272
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:49,254
To prevent the giant beast from
running rampant and killing us all.

273
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:50,683
What is this thing?

274
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,221
A Blefuscian spy.

275
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:55,189
I'm not a blue fish man.
I don't even know what that is.

276
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,294
Will someone please just
tell me where I am?

277
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,396
You are in Lilliput.

278
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:00,762
Lilli-puh?

279
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:05,336
The grandest and greatest land
in all the world. All hail Lilliput!

280
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:06,801
All hail Lilliput!

281
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,133
This is insane. This is insane.

282
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,971
Okay, enough.
Come out with the funny cameras.

283
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,487
Mealtime, beast!

284
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,767
Hay? I can't eat hay.

285
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:43,806
Eat up! You have a busy day
ahead of you, beast!

286
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,102
Enough with the beast!

287
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:48,075
I may be a giant, but I have feelings!

288
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,743
I think you'll find that the hay...

289
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,978
is a bit more digestible
if mixed with some...

290
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:57,178
sewer water.

291
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,656
I'm sorry that my countrymen call you
a beast. I do not think of you as a beast.

292
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,089
As a matter of fact,
before you arrived...

293
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,622
I was the tallest man in Lilliput.

294
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,796
So I know how you feel.

295
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:12,732
Thanks, man.

296
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,538
I can't reach you for a handshake.
I'm Gulliver.

297
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,605
Horatio.

298
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,841
Oh, man.

299
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,711
You guys are so tiny.

300
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,045
Are you the only other prisoner
in the whole dungeon?

301
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,152
Yes.

302
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:32,119
I have been placed in this prison
by the great and glorious...

303
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,280
General Edward Edwardian...

304
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,586
for sending a lascivious look
to his betrothed...

305
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:37,956
Princess Mary.

306
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:38,892
That's it?

307
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,191
He put you in prison
for hitting on his lady?

308
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,892
Dude, that is harsh.

309
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:47,266
No, you must understand.
I am of a lowly station.

310
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,907
To legally court a woman
of her stature...

311
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,940
one must commit a valiant action...

312
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,341
and this is virtually impossible
as a commoner.

313
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:58,210
Come on, don't be so hard on yourself.
You seem like a cool guy.

314
00:21:58,383 --> 00:21:59,850
You could do something valiant.

315
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,384
General Edward has led
countless crusades...

316
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:04,920
and is known far and wide
for his bravery.

317
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,149
I'm no General Edward.

318
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,191
Well, no offense...

319
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,159
this Edward guy seems
like kind of a lame ass.

320
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,593
A lame what?

321
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,394
It is my impression...

322
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,161
that "lame ass"...

323
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,670
is a negative expression
from whence you came.

324
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,738
If this is the case...

325
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:25,433
you shall be thrown in the stocks!

326
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,044
No, no, no! "Lame ass" means...

327
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:29,475
great...

328
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,946
brave and courageous...

329
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:33,675
heart-of-a-lion man.

330
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:35,113
Is this the honorable truth?

331
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,847
Yes, this is the honorable truth.

332
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,756
Then, I am not just...

333
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:40,914
a lame ass.

334
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,356
Oh, no.

335
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:44,528
I'm a big lame ass!

336
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,458
The biggest!

337
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,565
I, General Edward Edwardian,
am the biggest lame ass in all of the land!

338
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:49,723
Heart of a lion.

339
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:51,793
So, listen...

340
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,063
now that you know we're cool...

341
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:56,763
what do you say you loosen
up these shackles a bit?

342
00:22:58,443 --> 00:22:59,467
No.

343
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,704
It is time for your life
of hard labor to begin.

344
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:04,649
Left!

345
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,539
Forward!

346
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:08,675
Left!

347
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,446
Right!

348
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:11,880
Left!

349
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:23,360
Their defense system is operational.

350
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,332
We must move in stealthily.

351
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:32,401
Left!

352
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,013
- Did I tell you to stop fanning, peasant?
- Sorry.

353
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:38,545
Sorry.

354
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:46,852
They will be too busy with the fire
to protect their princess.

355
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:54,997
A fire!

356
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,658
A fire is two bells, that was three.
It's an attack!

357
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,303
No, it actually sounded more like...

358
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,166
two bells, and then, a pause...

359
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:02,363
and then a third bell.

360
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,202
So, it's an attack and a fire?

361
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,344
- The Blefuscians!
- The princess!

362
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:08,103
To the castle, beast!

363
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,205
Left, right, left, right.

364
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:12,873
Faster, beast!

365
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:22,622
Oh, no. The Blefuscians.

366
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,489
Do not kidnap me.

367
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:25,994
Please do not kidnap me.

368
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,461
Why is she just standing there?

369
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,463
Of course, she's gonna
get kidnapped if she...

370
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,102
You speak not of the princess. Down!

371
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:37,237
I shall save you, my princess.

372
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,001
My princess.

373
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:44,640
Dude, I can help.

374
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,842
We do not need your help, beast.
You just stay here.

375
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:51,517
Nobody save the princess!

376
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:55,217
He'll never get to her in time.
Please, you must save the princess.

377
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,987
But you heard that angry
little dingleberry. He said I shouldn't.

378
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:58,925
I beg of you!

379
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,801
- It is too late.
- You are kidnapped.

380
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,441
I am kidnapped!

381
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,600
Not on my watch.

382
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,087
Hop on, princess.
Let's get you out of here.

383
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:30,218
Fear not, my darling!
I am here to save you.

384
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,027
Where has she gone?

385
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,428
Oh, she has been kidnapped.

386
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:39,229
There you go, Princess.

387
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:41,634
Thank you so much.

388
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:43,103
Are you okay?

389
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,606
Yes.

390
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,475
Thank God.

391
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:51,972
The Blefuscians are retreating.

392
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,913
We are to have a victory feast.

393
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,575
How lovely.

394
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:57,588
The fire has raged out of control.

395
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:59,417
My father is trapped!

396
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:02,126
You guys have to invest
in a more efficient warning system.

397
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:04,825
Your Highness!

398
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,394
Out of the way. I have to put out a fire.

399
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:11,432
Out of the way.

400
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,070
I'm coming through!

401
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:15,970
The beast!

402
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,808
Yama-schatzi, that's hot!

403
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,912
Princess, no!

404
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,106
Princess, you mustn't.

405
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,478
Father! He's burning!

406
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:30,018
You have served me with great honor.

407
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:32,418
We need access
to a great deal of water.

408
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:33,649
Do something!

409
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:38,194
Oh, Lilliput, great kingdom...

410
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:39,929
I do not wanna do this.

411
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,463
You have a plan?

412
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,362
I have a plan,
but you're not gonna like it.

413
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:47,968
Don't look.

414
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:59,206
Cease, beast!

415
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,181
- It's working!
- Huzzah!

416
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:02,980
Yeah, it's working!

417
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:04,616
Out of my way!

418
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,381
How dare you evacuate yourself...

419
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:08,685
on our great and glorious king!

420
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,264
Oh, no. Oh, no.

421
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:17,026
Sorry about the smell.
I've been drinking sewer water.

422
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,397
This is grounds for execution!

423
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:21,129
I know, that was pretty gross.

424
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,898
Let me pull up my trousers.

425
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:24,041
Father!

426
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:26,703
Father!

427
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,306
You look glorious.

428
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:34,912
Thank you, my dear.

429
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,388
Our savior!

430
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:47,531
The beast!

431
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,558
Beast! Beast! Beast!

432
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,362
You guys, it was nothing, really.

433
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,063
I saw a fire...

434
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:58,471
I had some water, I released!

435
00:27:58,643 --> 00:27:59,871
Flood on aisle two.

436
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,109
Does that translate here?
Is that a joke here?

437
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,805
Flood on aisle two?

438
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:07,746
Thanks, you guys.

439
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:17,423
The king requests the honor
of your company...

440
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:20,063
at a banquet this evening.
Do you accept?

441
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:21,129
Yeah.

442
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:22,926
On one condition.

443
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:26,468
You free my friend, Horatio,
and allow me to bring him as my plus one.

444
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:30,972
He is jailed for... unlawful courting.
He must return.

445
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:34,077
That's my condish!

446
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:36,270
One moment, if you will.

447
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,748
Why are you doing this for me?

448
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,718
Because you're my buddy.
I'm not gonna go to this thing without you.

449
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,948
I'm not gonna know anybody there.
You have to come.

450
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,217
Play it cool.

451
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:53,129
The king requests the honor of your...

452
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:57,667
and Horatio the Glovier's company at a
royal banquet this evening. Do you accept?

453
00:28:58,136 --> 00:28:59,501
Yes, indeed.

454
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,099
- I can make it.
- Oh, God.

455
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:06,902
Oh, my God.

456
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,568
I'm forever indebted to you.

457
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,341
It's not necessary.
Instead, let's just do this.

458
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:12,948
What is that?

459
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:14,745
You pound it with your fist!

460
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,683
Come on, don't leave me hanging.

461
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:20,788
Yeah!

462
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,894
Now let's go party!

463
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:34,927
Is anyone gonna...

464
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,399
I'm just gonna go ahead and get this.

465
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:53,619
So, since you're not...

466
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,851
from Blefuscia...

467
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:57,961
where are you from...

468
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,127
beast?

469
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:03,324
Once again, totally cool
to be just called Gulliver.

470
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:07,494
Some people believe you've come
from the Island Where We Dare Not Go.

471
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,740
Is there any truth to this rumor?

472
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:13,241
No. Where's the
Island Where We Dare Not Go?

473
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,042
There...

474
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:18,045
beyond the fog bank.

475
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:20,150
I didn't come through a fog bank.

476
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,252
I'm from the island of Manhattan...

477
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,648
between the islands of...

478
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,416
Staten and Long.

479
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:29,583
This island of Manhattan,
what sort of kingdom is it?

480
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:34,160
I'm not from a kingdom.
I'm actually from a democracy.

481
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,892
You see, we elect a president
every four years.

482
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:38,558
You are so honorable...

483
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:40,033
and courageous.

484
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,339
Were you the president?

485
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,101
Of course, he was, Mother.
Look at him.

486
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:47,267
He is the most powerful
gentleman in all the land.

487
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:49,037
I'm so sorry if Mother
embarrassed you.

488
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,714
No, it's a common mistake
to not think I was president.

489
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,216
Were you a victorious president?

490
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:57,581
Yeah. I was pretty victorious.

491
00:30:57,755 --> 00:30:59,017
Noble, as well?

492
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,852
Yeah, I was super noble.

493
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:07,463
I was actually known
as "President the Awesome. "

494
00:31:09,065 --> 00:31:10,969
"President the Awesome. "

495
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:12,397
Pretty unlikely title.

496
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:17,063
When do you return home,
noble and awesome Gulliver?

497
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,972
Pretty soon, I suppose. Yes?

498
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:22,612
I should imagine they're
falling apart without you...

499
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,748
their greatest hero.

500
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:29,476
Without my boat,
looks like I'm stuck here.

501
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,884
Don't worry.
My army will find your boat.

502
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,990
In the meantime,
we could find you accommodations.

503
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:35,318
Like some hay to sleep on?

504
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:37,324
- Anything.
- Anything?

505
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:40,259
We are the finest builders in all the land.
We can build you anything.

506
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:43,958
Seriously, we are ridiculously
good builders.

507
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:46,296
And we are your servants,
awesome Gulliver.

508
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,803
I don't wanna take advantage, but...

509
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,951
It's day seven
of my stay here in Lilliput.

510
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:06,522
At first, me and the little guys
got off on the wrong foot...

511
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:09,216
but turns out they're
a pretty solid group of dudes.

512
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:12,022
They're building me
a temporary place to live.

513
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:16,064
They threw me an awesome party
just for releasing myself...

514
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:19,294
and the king sent out
a search party to find my boat.

515
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,370
In the meantime...

516
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,507
I'm roughing it.

517
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:32,907
That is a good cup of joe.

518
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,051
Good morning!

519
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:35,185
Morning, Gulliver.

520
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:36,718
- Morning!
- Morning!

521
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,778
Top of the morning to you, fellas.

522
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,537
Gulliver...

523
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,866
your media room is ready.

524
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:00,173
Obi-Wan never told you
what happened to your father.

525
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:02,711
He told me enough. He told me...

526
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,869
you killed him!

527
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:05,515
No, Gulliver.

528
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:07,150
I am your father.

529
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:09,015
No way.

530
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:11,211
This is an impossibility!

531
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:13,482
Yet somehow,
it seems completely inevitable.

532
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,058
Gulliver, you truly have
lived a thousand lives.

533
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:20,695
King Theodore, it is time to perform
our bi-weekly military exercises.

534
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:24,699
Just one moment.
We're watching the stories...

535
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:26,029
of Gulliver's life.

536
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:28,570
We have not missed a military
exercise in over three hundred years.

537
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:29,403
Dude!

538
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,273
Get out of the way.
We cannot see the screen!

539
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:34,673
Move! Move!

540
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,744
The Titanic is sinking!

541
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:39,712
But it was meant to be unsinkable.

542
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:43,781
I love you, Gulliver.

543
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:45,547
No, don't do that.

544
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:48,055
You're gonna make lots of babies
and die in a warm bed...

545
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:49,352
in old age.

546
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:54,863
I'm cold.

547
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,095
And also...

548
00:33:58,236 --> 00:33:59,794
I'm king of the world!

549
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:02,464
Oh, Gulliver.

550
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:07,745
Bravo!

551
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:09,301
Encore!

552
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,469
Wait!

553
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,307
I'm sorry.

554
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:16,317
You mean to say that you actually died
in this shipwreck?

555
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:17,385
Yeah, I died.

556
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,317
You actually died.

557
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,047
But I was resuscitated.

558
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,384
It's preposterous.

559
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,958
No, but then I survived.

560
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,719
It's ridiculous.

561
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,761
- You have to see the seq...
- But you're okay now!

562
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:28,125
It's silly.

563
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:30,893
Just silly, silly stories.

564
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:35,028
So, let me get this straight.

565
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:37,606
After you were brought back
to life as an avatar...

566
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:41,301
that's when you met your princess,
Darcy Silverman of Manhattan?

567
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,106
Yeah. Can't wait to get back to her.

568
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:46,447
I noticed you had a little
eye contact with the princess.

569
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:48,380
- How is it going?
- Good, yeah!

570
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:50,748
I think if things go well,
within two to four years...

571
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,389
she may deign to speak to me.

572
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:55,250
Hold your horses.

573
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,427
Thank God.

574
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,791
Now, you can't woo a lady
by hoping she'll deign...

575
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:00,931
to speak to you.

576
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,364
To land a princess, you got to employ
some grade-A court-age.

577
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:06,026
Could you teach me?

578
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:09,700
This court-age that you speak.

579
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:15,405
Yeah, I could teach you
some of my moves.

580
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,277
- Yes!
- Thank you.

581
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,177
If you beat me back home.

582
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,682
- I need a head start.
- On you mark, get set, go!

583
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:23,411
I'm not ready to race you!

584
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:36,927
Princess! Oh, Princess!

585
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:39,069
Wherefore art thou, Princess?

586
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,372
Hello! Who calls?

587
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,734
It is I, Horatio.

588
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,637
Why are you so far away?

589
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,608
I don't want to invoke
the ire of thy father.

590
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:49,905
But I must be honest...

591
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:51,105
And tell ye...

592
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:53,011
And tell ye...

593
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:55,675
Tell me what, Horatio?

594
00:35:57,688 --> 00:36:00,919
You don't have to be rich
to be my girl.

595
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:03,188
Say it!

596
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:07,390
You don't have to be rich
to be my girl.

597
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,726
You don't have to be cool
to rule my world.

598
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:13,200
You don't have to be cool
to rule my world.

599
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:15,999
Horatio, these passionate words
could get us into trouble.

600
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,699
There's no particular sign
I'm more compatible with.

601
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:22,676
There's no particular sign
that I'm more compatible with.

602
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,247
I just want your extra time and your...

603
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:29,215
...kiss.

604
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:33,255
Kiss.

605
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:36,222
What beauty emanates from your lips!

606
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:38,021
Think I'm gonna dance now.

607
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,795
I think I'd better dance now.

608
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,458
Think I'm gonna dance now!

609
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,964
Put more mustard on it, baby.

610
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,906
Feel it. Move your hips.

611
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,274
I don't think it's working.

612
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,044
You're not dancing good. Shake it!

613
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:07,758
I've never been wooed
with such unique passion.

614
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:10,320
It's working!

615
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:13,957
Did I tell you?

616
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:15,792
Yes!

617
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:18,959
I hear someone coming!
Till the morrow.

618
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,007
It worked! I did it!

619
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,842
Let's go.

620
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:28,176
Yes!

621
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:31,743
To whom were you speaking,
my darling?

622
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:34,947
No one.

623
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,849
Me. I was... I was speaking to me.

624
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:38,852
Myself.

625
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:40,923
What are you doing in my chambers?

626
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,753
I have come to court you...

627
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,326
as I always do...

628
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:45,462
at this time of day.

629
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:50,631
Or have you already forgotten
who is your one true eternal love?

630
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:53,668
No, no. Of course, I remember.

631
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:56,400
Remember what?

632
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:00,071
That you are my one true...

633
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:01,676
...eternal love.

634
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,336
It's just that I was talking...

635
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:05,175
with the giant and lost track of time.

636
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:06,816
I trust not this beast.

637
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,385
Seems trustworthy to me.

638
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:11,748
- He's very nice.
- You've done sewing.

639
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:13,048
Sewing. Yes.

640
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:14,384
An embroidery.

641
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:17,049
It's my grandmother's doily
and I'm trying to present...

642
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:19,526
I captured a hawk today.

643
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:21,028
Did you?

644
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:25,430
He lay in a field. I came behind him
and captured him with my bare hand.

645
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:30,196
This is impressive, also.

646
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:36,073
Fun.

647
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:38,010
Fun courtship...

648
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:40,082
you and I have.

649
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:41,843
It is over now.

650
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:43,816
Must go.

651
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:47,684
Those villagers shan't
pillage themselves.

652
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:02,733
We must alert General Edward
of this at once.

653
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,509
We've found it.

654
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,376
I hear you, ring-a-ling-a-ding-dong.

655
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:12,175
Okay, I'm coming...
Hey, how's it going?

656
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,443
Hello, beast!

657
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:16,677
I come bearing the most terrific news!

658
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:17,946
Yeah? Really?

659
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:20,420
We have discovered your ship.

660
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:22,786
The Knotfersail.

661
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,188
Clever name.

662
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:26,954
You did it!

663
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:30,794
You found my boat.
I'm actually going home.

664
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:33,561
Hey, you guys can
fix this thing, right?

665
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:36,400
Of course, you can.
You're incredibly awesome builders.

666
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:38,268
Yes!

667
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:44,245
Darcy is about to read
the best article ever.

668
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:46,143
I'm talking Pulitzer.

669
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:50,052
"Slide to unlock. "

670
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,218
What are you guys doing?

671
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:56,893
Is that my phone?
Man, it takes a lickin'.

672
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:59,319
No signal, but I got 12 messages.

673
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:01,761
Mr. Popularity.

674
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:04,332
Hey, Gulliver. It's me. It's Darcy.

675
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:07,834
I just realized why I felt like
your writing came straight...

676
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:12,465
out of Frommer's. Because it does!
Call me as soon as you get this.

677
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:14,110
Sergeant Peacock, what's it doing?

678
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:16,143
He's checking his voicemail,
General Edward.

679
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:17,109
Good.

680
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:18,441
What's voicemail?

681
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:22,313
Hey, Lemuel! It's Darcy.
I've totally forgiven you.

682
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:23,817
Wait! No, I haven't...

683
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:26,786
because now I have to get seasick
on a boat to cover your butt!

684
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:27,946
Thanks for this.

685
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,423
And if you can't tell,
that "thanks" was sarcastic.

686
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,453
Darcy, again.

687
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:37,089
I can't believe you lied to me.
I trusted you.

688
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,101
Wherever you're hiding, stay there.

689
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,297
I never want to hear from you again.

690
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:46,935
Mr. Beast...

691
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,102
I've instructed our builders...

692
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,842
to work day and night to ensure
you are seaworthy by week's end.

693
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:58,318
Isn't that just the most fantastical news
you've ever received in your life?

694
00:40:58,489 --> 00:40:59,513
Great.

695
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,318
I can't tell you how happy I am...

696
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:04,460
for you.

697
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:16,205
Why do you look so forlorn,
noble protector?

698
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:19,069
Me? Forlorn? No way.

699
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:21,302
You do look quite forlorn.

700
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:25,040
Just for the record, what's "forlorn"
mean, again? Is it "sad"?

701
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,650
Basically, it's just
a bit more dramatic-sounding.

702
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,981
Yeah, well, in that case,
I guess I am a little forlorn.

703
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,144
Oh, Gulliver...

704
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,348
you miss your princess.

705
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:40,161
The truth is, we're not super close.

706
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,730
Oh, Gulliver.

707
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,665
She's kind of mad at me right now.

708
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:47,097
I am forlorn as well.

709
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:51,036
I don't know what to do.

710
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,776
I think I'm in love with Horatio.

711
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:57,209
But that's great!
Don't be forlorn about that.

712
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:59,941
Most people spend their lives
looking for that and don't find it.

713
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:02,108
Go for it! Follow your heart.

714
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:04,413
But my heart
is promised to General Edward.

715
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:07,853
And I cannot break that vow.
He will lose honor and respect.

716
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,788
And he will die of heartbreak.

717
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,793
Okay. Look, he's just
being melodramatic.

718
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:14,925
- Is he?
- Yeah.

719
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,230
Gulliver, I will miss you so much.

720
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:20,427
I'm gonna miss you, too.

721
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:23,767
Maybe I should stay.

722
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:25,533
Don't you miss your subjects?

723
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,040
And the White House?

724
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,473
And the Millennium Falcon?

725
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:30,774
Yeah.

726
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:34,075
But Vice President Yoda
can run things without me for a while.

727
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,420
Do you think the king would mind
if I stuck around for a bit?

728
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:41,387
Well, of course not, Gulliver.

729
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:44,117
You've made everyone here so happy.

730
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:48,432
I can't imagine anyone in Lilliput not
wanting you to stay as long as possible.

731
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:51,632
Noble and valiant King Theodore.

732
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:55,397
I trust-eth not this beast,
Gulliver who lives-t in our midst-ith-ith.

733
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:59,065
He can now leave, but he
chooses to stay. And furthermore...

734
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:02,109
I do not believe it
who he say-eth he is-eth.

735
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:04,611
I most-eth humbly disagree-eth.

736
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:07,945
And why-eth must we always
go on with these "eths"?

737
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,577
Because we speak officially-eth.

738
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,848
Forget it. From now on,
even when speaking officially...

739
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:15,286
we must get rid of these "eths. "

740
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:16,448
Official speaking is...

741
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:18,618
an illustrious Lilliputian tradition!

742
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:22,595
Inside castle voice. Please.

743
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,592
Forgive me-eth.

744
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,867
Forgive me.

745
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,670
I think this job is
beginning to stress you out.

746
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,437
Maybe a little time off
would be the thing.

747
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,682
Who else could run your army?

748
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:42,018
Our new general, Gulliver!

749
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:43,847
I won't let you down, King.

750
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:48,556
And I look forward to working with you,
Vice General Edward.

751
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:55,227
"Vice General. " Vice!

752
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:57,560
I've never been a Vice of anything.

753
00:43:57,735 --> 00:44:01,034
I can't be expected to take orders
from that gargantuan fool.

754
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:02,900
I would rather take orders
from a woman.

755
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:06,201
- You are relieved.
- Thank you, Vice General Edward.

756
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,215
All right, Gulliver,
protect against this.

757
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:24,554
They have turned off
their defense system.

758
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:27,424
Alert the king,
and prepare the armada.

759
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:44,972
Oh, no. Our defense system has failed.

760
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,707
We shall never reach
our ships on time.

761
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:50,854
Careful now. Mind yourselves.

762
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,784
Oh, what a mess.

763
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:54,854
They are defenseless.

764
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,118
Cease fire and ready the troops!

765
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:58,525
Gulliver!

766
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:00,521
The Blefuscians attack!

767
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,232
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

768
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:06,892
Please, we need you.
You're our general.

769
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:15,939
Good lord!

770
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,642
It's the entire Blefuscian armada!

771
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:20,113
I know.

772
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:31,118
Finally! Our general has arrived.

773
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:33,489
What's going on? I heard the bells.

774
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:35,598
As our mighty general...

775
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:37,996
you must lead the army
to save Lilliput...

776
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:40,966
and vanquish
the entire Blefuscian armada.

777
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:44,805
You want me to...

778
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:46,668
vanquish all of them?

779
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:47,674
Yes, please.

780
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:49,073
Every last one of them.

781
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:51,780
Yeah, fine.

782
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:53,416
Thank you, fair Gulliver.

783
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:56,178
Okay, here we go.

784
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,953
Time to vanquish.

785
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:07,627
It's cold!

786
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,466
No problem.

787
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:17,333
You're going down!

788
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:33,016
Why have we stopped?

789
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:34,713
It's him.

790
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:45,524
Hey, dudes.

791
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:47,796
I'm Gulliver.

792
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,871
I come in peace. Listen...

793
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,634
they want me to vanquish you,
but I don't want to vanquish anybody...

794
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,334
and you don't want to be vanquished.

795
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:57,537
Let's just pretend, okay? I'll go crazy.

796
00:46:57,714 --> 00:47:00,410
You act all scared
and just follow my lead, all right?

797
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:01,681
Sell it!

798
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,288
Okay. Here we go.

799
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,558
Unfurl the sails!

800
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:11,591
Hard to starboard!

801
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:13,229
Battle stations.

802
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:15,331
Prepare positions.

803
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:17,432
Move! Move!

804
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:19,330
This truly is a battle for the ages.

805
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,697
It truly is.

806
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:28,972
Okay, so now, I'll just tell them you
were too swift or whatever and...

807
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:30,340
How come you all turned around?

808
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,503
Fire!

809
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:38,518
Oh, no. That looks painful.

810
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:53,894
Move!

811
00:47:58,742 --> 00:47:59,936
I'm invincible.

812
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:02,541
Yes!

813
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,271
Go on, Gulliver!

814
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,968
Well done, sir! Well done! Excellent!

815
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:33,405
Gulliver! Gulliver!

816
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:36,102
Well done, you big, fat beast.

817
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:45,182
Pound it.

818
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:46,922
- Respect.
- Well done, Gulliver!

819
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,148
Awesome!

820
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:59,461
- Pass!
- That's a foul! That's disgraceful!

821
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,937
Goal!

822
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:07,776
The beast is victorious.

823
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,277
Goal!

824
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:12,773
All right!

825
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:14,007
Yeah!

826
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:18,517
Guys, this is what I'm talking about.

827
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:21,852
Look at that.
With the billboards and the lights...

828
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:24,459
it's home sweet home.
What can I say?

829
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,859
Hey, could you guys send over a panzer
division to my left shoulder, please?

830
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:30,798
Yeah, north, two klicks.

831
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,060
One klick.

832
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:35,398
Oh, yeah, that's the spot.

833
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,573
Okay, just a little off the top.
Don't go crazy.

834
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:44,510
And don't shave off my sideburns.
I need those mutton chops.

835
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:01,722
I wanna rock and roll

836
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:03,195
All night

837
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:05,594
And party every day

838
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:09,398
I wanna rock and roll all night

839
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,007
And party every day

840
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,437
I wanna

841
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:16,238
Rock and roll all night

842
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:19,314
And you are my bitch

843
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:20,848
And I double-defeated you

844
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,179
because I was playing and singing

845
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:26,414
You did good, though.
Let's try it again from the top.

846
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:30,353
- One sec, please. Pause game.
- Pause game.

847
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:33,623
I was just thinking.
You're general of Lilliput now.

848
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:37,096
Shouldn't you be training the army?
What if Blefuscia should attack again?

849
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:39,360
Come on, man!
No one's gonna attack.

850
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,868
Not while I'm around.
I'm a one-man wrecking crew.

851
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,439
If you want to worry,
you should be worrying about how...

852
00:50:44,608 --> 00:50:46,701
you haven't made a move
on the princess yet.

853
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,311
You're in danger of falling
into friendship lagoon.

854
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:50,204
What?

855
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,078
Yeah, friendship lagoon. It blows.

856
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,980
You're gonna be like, "We're friends,
it's great. I'm cool with that. "

857
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:57,415
And you won't be cool with that!

858
00:50:57,587 --> 00:50:59,578
And it kills you inside.

859
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:02,122
No. No, never!

860
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:03,622
Yeah, man!

861
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:05,557
You have to man up and be direct.

862
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,629
Next time you see her,
just tell her what's up.

863
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:09,663
"Hey, what's up, sexy?

864
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:13,564
"I hope it's not too forward,
but I find you incredibly sexy.

865
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,500
"Never told you before
but I'm into you...

866
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:18,334
"but I'm also into a lot of things,
so don't get too excited.

867
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:22,239
"Got a lot of things going on.
I'd like you to be one of them. "

868
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,175
You see the way I mixed it up?

869
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:26,838
"I want you, but not that much. "
You try it.

870
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:28,109
Okay...

871
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:29,149
should I use the face?

872
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:31,844
If the face comes to you,
but make it natural.

873
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:35,116
Don't make it a forced face.
I just have one of those faces.

874
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:36,987
It sort of happens naturally.

875
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:40,026
My hands are sweating.

876
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:41,027
Go.

877
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:42,654
Okay.

878
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:45,601
Well, hello...

879
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:49,432
fine maiden with
the wide, childbearing hips.

880
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,872
Yikes. You don't want to talk
about wide childbearing hips.

881
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:56,710
It's a good instinct.
You're getting there.

882
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,973
But try it again. But this time,
more smooth and sexy.

883
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:01,278
- No big hips?
- No big hips.

884
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,248
I think I got it.

885
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:09,415
Well, hello there, slim.

886
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,161
I ought to call you "potamus"...

887
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:16,032
because you've got no hip.

888
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:24,063
Do we have to be here for this?

889
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:26,741
Take five, save game.

890
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:29,140
Forget about the hips.
Here's what you have to do.

891
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:31,574
You have to make sure...

892
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:38,350
What are you doing in my chambers?

893
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:42,655
I have come to court you
as I always do at this time of the day.

894
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,589
This is not the time of day
for courting.

895
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:46,786
You cannot just barge in.

896
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,862
I can court you
when I wish to court you.

897
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:52,058
I am not in the mood to be courted.
I have a headache.

898
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:55,998
It is your womanly duty.

899
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:59,074
Section 4.2 of
the official courting doctrine...

900
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:00,209
Edward!

901
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:04,209
I am unsure about things between us.

902
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:09,376
It be not you, it be me,
but I'm very unsure.

903
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:11,544
That make-th no sense.

904
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:15,020
We are to be married.
You are to be my bride.

905
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,786
We are not in love.
We are not in love.

906
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:20,793
What do you love about me?
Name one thing.

907
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:25,466
Inappropriate, Edward.

908
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:32,367
- Reach for it.
- One second.

909
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,873
Okay, take your time.

910
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:37,974
I find you...

911
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:40,747
absolutely...

912
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:42,879
satisfactory.

913
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:43,781
No.

914
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:44,978
That is not enough...

915
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:48,318
to say that someone is average
or adequate or moderate.

916
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:50,721
I want to be loved for who I am.

917
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,122
There's an awful lot...

918
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:53,489
going on up here.

919
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:55,153
- Is there?
- Now you're being cruel...

920
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:57,323
and, frankly, melodramatic.

921
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,263
And acting like a complete baby!

922
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:01,063
You are acting like a little princess.

923
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,170
I am a princess!

924
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:03,772
But maybe you should...

925
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,771
act like a princess.

926
00:54:05,942 --> 00:54:07,637
Gulliver was so right about you.

927
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:10,143
- Why don't we all listen to the beast!
- Don't call him that!

928
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:12,304
He's a big ugly beast
and you should know better.

929
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:13,847
Get out!

930
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:16,849
You cannot break our engagement!
It is worse than death!

931
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:17,850
Get out!

932
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:26,287
You will be sorry you ever
crossed General Edward.

933
00:54:34,237 --> 00:54:37,764
Get your Gulliver's T-shirts!
Dress like Gulliver.

934
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,432
You, sir!
Get your Gulliver's T-shirts here.

935
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:50,184
Get your Gulliver's T-shirts here!

936
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,513
Gulliver's T-shirts!

937
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:55,988
Look at him. He's handsome!

938
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:28,318
What do you want?

939
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:32,559
This beast...

940
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:34,329
has transformed Lilliput...

941
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:37,864
into his own sordid
and rotten little kingdom.

942
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:42,227
And he will do the same with
your land if we do not stop him.

943
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:44,396
To save Lilliput...

944
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,071
I must first destroy it.

945
00:55:47,243 --> 00:55:49,837
How do you suggest
we accomplish...

946
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,674
such a dangerous task?

947
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:03,420
I have got stuff! Look.

948
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:08,722
I'm showing you.

949
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:11,890
All right! Welcome to
the first ever Lillapalooza!

950
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:14,935
Let's get this party started
with a little jam I wrote!

951
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:18,105
Right?

952
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:19,639
What are you up to in the morrow?

953
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:21,071
- In the morrow?
- Yes.

954
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:23,644
I'm just hanging.

955
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:25,405
So, yeah.

956
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:29,443
Would you care to attend
the Ball of the Moonlit Glen with me?

957
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:30,813
- The ball?
- Yeah.

958
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:32,511
The ball is tomorrow?

959
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:34,122
Right. Maybe.

960
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:35,416
It's a pretty tasty jam!

961
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:37,787
Pretty tasty jam.

962
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:39,724
Why are you acting like this?

963
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,057
- Acting like what?
- Why are you being so strange?

964
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:46,797
I'm a gentleman merchant
about town...

965
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,733
and I have got to keep
my options open.

966
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:50,102
Do you?

967
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:51,932
That's what I've been told.

968
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:54,201
I'm not an option. I'm a lady.

969
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:56,677
I know you are, and I love ladies.

970
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:58,409
Believe me... Okay!

971
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,277
I'm sorry. I was...

972
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,083
Five bells!

973
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:10,649
Five bells? What does five bells mean?

974
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:12,124
There have never been five bells.

975
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:15,128
Yeah? Don't worry about it...

976
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:19,394
because this guy throws down
no matter how many bells are a-ringin'.

977
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:28,839
Don't freak, little peeps.
This one is on me.

978
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:41,412
You must be kidding me.
This is five bells?

979
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:46,627
It's cute.

980
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:48,229
Edward, you traitor!

981
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:50,696
How dare you forsake
your Lilliputian brethren!

982
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:52,801
I only forsooked after I was forsooken.

983
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,960
The forsookingness ends now!

984
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:58,232
I challenge you to a duel!

985
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:01,333
Cool. Whatever.

986
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:03,206
So, you accept?

987
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:06,610
Oh, yeah! Yeah, I accept your duel.

988
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:08,642
Oh, goody!

989
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:09,842
Make a move.

990
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:39,441
Wow, you are hard.

991
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:44,846
Okay!

992
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:46,347
Just...

993
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:47,888
stretching out the hammies.

994
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:49,854
It's a good thing to do
before the duel.

995
00:58:58,001 --> 00:59:01,061
You brought this on yourself, beast.

996
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:02,465
Do you surrender, beast?

997
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:04,902
Sure, yeah! Whatever!

998
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:06,735
No, say it properly.

999
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:08,468
- Say you surrender.
- Oh, yeah.

1000
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:12,308
Say it! Say it! Say, "I surrender!"

1001
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:15,883
I surrender! I surrender, I surrender!

1002
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:16,814
You win.

1003
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:17,816
It hurts my butt.

1004
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:21,286
You cannot surrender!
You are our most glorious protector!

1005
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:22,788
You're President the Awesome!

1006
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:25,951
And you and Captain Sparrow
defeated the Joker and Magneto!

1007
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:28,757
And you and Jack Bauer
had only 24 hours to do it!

1008
00:59:29,198 --> 00:59:31,462
I didn't do any of that stuff.

1009
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:33,625
I'm just a guy from the mailroom.

1010
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:35,168
But you gave us your word!

1011
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:37,033
I'm sorry.

1012
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:39,308
I lied.

1013
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:41,599
I knew it!

1014
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,309
I hereby banish this beast...

1015
00:59:45,481 --> 00:59:46,948
to the Island Where We Dare Not Go...

1016
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:48,777
never to return to Lilliput again!

1017
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:52,143
Take your positions!

1018
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,028
Please, Gulliver.

1019
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:14,537
Hey...

1020
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:18,043
is this Island Where We Dare Not Go
really as bad as they say?

1021
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:19,738
It's delightful!

1022
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:56,178
Okay.

1023
01:00:56,886 --> 01:01:00,982
No little people anywhere.
That's a good sign.

1024
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:04,593
Hello! Is anybody here?

1025
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:15,834
No way.

1026
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:25,605
Raise the standard!

1027
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:34,913
Let's lose this rubbish!

1028
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:36,752
Lower away!

1029
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:43,024
Can I not walk alone
in my own garden?

1030
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,860
Go away!

1031
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,044
Princess!

1032
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:03,578
I've secured a boat.

1033
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:05,152
We can leave tonight.

1034
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:06,719
No, Horatio.

1035
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:09,418
But Edward is gonna
force you to marry him.

1036
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:11,787
I don't have any choice.

1037
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:14,225
Please. Of course you have a choice.

1038
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:16,489
No, you made that choice for me.

1039
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:18,429
You don't understand.

1040
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:19,625
Gulliver told me...

1041
01:02:19,836 --> 01:02:22,498
Everything Gulliver said was a lie...

1042
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:24,663
including you.

1043
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:42,683
Oh, I'm paralyzed from
the neck down.

1044
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:44,087
What's that? What's crawling on me?

1045
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,920
Not fire ants.
Oh, please don't be fire an...

1046
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:50,322
I am General Edward Edwardian...

1047
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,469
commander of New Blefuscia.
All hail New Blefuscia.

1048
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:55,103
All hail New Blefuscia!

1049
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:56,965
I must warn Gulliver.

1050
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:58,368
State your name...

1051
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:00,303
she-beast.

1052
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:02,034
Darcy Silverman.

1053
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:03,942
Of Manhattan.

1054
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:04,103
Oh, no!

1055
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:34,399
I'm not doing this.

1056
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:38,802
You got me in the diaper and the dress.
I'm not doing teatime with you.

1057
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:40,834
Go find another doll.

1058
01:04:46,649 --> 01:04:49,083
Tea! Time for tea!

1059
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:52,010
Okay, we're kissing.

1060
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,790
Gentler. Let's just hold hands
or something!

1061
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:08,097
What's up?

1062
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:10,466
What kind of toy are you?

1063
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:12,673
Top Gun G.I. Joe?

1064
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:14,832
Cool detail.

1065
01:06:08,664 --> 01:06:09,961
Gulliver!

1066
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:11,861
Gulliver!

1067
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:14,798
Down here.

1068
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,529
What are you doing here?

1069
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:19,402
Gulliver, you must return
to Lilliput with me at once.

1070
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:20,940
Forget it, man. It's a no-go.

1071
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:22,737
No, you don't understand.
Edward has...

1072
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:24,038
It doesn't matter.

1073
01:06:24,213 --> 01:06:27,512
I may be a hundred feet tall, but I'm not
half the size of one of you little guys.

1074
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:29,173
You have to listen. This is important.

1075
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:31,513
No, this is where I belong.

1076
01:06:31,687 --> 01:06:33,552
As a giant girl's baby doll.

1077
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:34,917
Hey!

1078
01:06:35,091 --> 01:06:37,184
Stop feeling sorry for yourself
and listen!

1079
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:40,194
Blefuscia has taken over Lilliput...

1080
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:42,888
and Edward has captured
Darcy Silverman of Manhattan.

1081
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:44,430
What?

1082
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:46,059
She's...

1083
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:47,668
- Darcy's here?
- Yeah.

1084
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,134
Oh, no.

1085
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:52,433
She said she was gonna
do the assignment herself.

1086
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:53,905
She's here because of me.

1087
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:55,771
It's all because of you.

1088
01:06:56,946 --> 01:06:59,073
How could you lie to us?

1089
01:07:00,649 --> 01:07:02,549
I was afraid to tell you guys the truth...

1090
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:07,852
because it was just so great being
a big shot for the first time in my life.

1091
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:11,259
I didn't want it to end.

1092
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:13,019
Snap out of it, man.

1093
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:16,926
You think of yourself as this small
little thing, but that's not how I see you.

1094
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:20,293
Think about what you've done already.
You saved the princess.

1095
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:23,267
You single-handedly defeated
the entire Blefuscian armada.

1096
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:25,236
Didn't you? Come on.

1097
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:27,205
I'm your best friend.

1098
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:28,570
I wouldn't lie to you.

1099
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,539
You can do this.

1100
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:33,477
So, take off that dress
and let's get out of here!

1101
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,312
Am I really your best friend?

1102
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:37,985
You're kind of my only friend.

1103
01:07:38,154 --> 01:07:40,315
Sweet, man. You, too, for me.

1104
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:41,922
Let's go save Lilliput.

1105
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:43,251
Yeah, let's go do this.

1106
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:46,452
Take me with you, yeah?

1107
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:50,194
One sec. There we go.

1108
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:52,326
- Oopsie-daisy.
- I got you!

1109
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,799
Okay, officer...

1110
01:07:56,005 --> 01:07:59,566
I'm just gonna borrow this parachute
if it's okay with you.

1111
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:02,200
You don't need it anymore.

1112
01:08:13,022 --> 01:08:15,047
This isn't safe!

1113
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,276
I'll let you...

1114
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:39,641
- Thanks, Horatio.
- Good luck.

1115
01:08:39,815 --> 01:08:41,043
I got this.

1116
01:08:43,018 --> 01:08:43,848
Darcy.

1117
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:45,717
Darce.

1118
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:49,350
- Gulliver!
- Hey.

1119
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:50,787
I'm coming over there.

1120
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:56,692
Are you okay?
I can't believe you're here.

1121
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:59,130
I mean, of all the places, right?

1122
01:09:02,071 --> 01:09:03,299
- What's up?
- What's up?

1123
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:05,565
What's up? What isn't up?

1124
01:09:05,741 --> 01:09:08,369
- Can we talk about the inverted whirlpool?
- Crazy.

1125
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:10,842
And why is everybody
calling me your princess?

1126
01:09:11,013 --> 01:09:13,140
They don't. I think you misheard.

1127
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:14,304
I see you have...

1128
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:16,041
returned for your princess.

1129
01:09:16,852 --> 01:09:19,514
He did, right there.
He just called me your princess.

1130
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:21,815
That's because everybody
is a princess here.

1131
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:24,016
I forgot to tell you,
it's just sort of a thing.

1132
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:26,354
If you wish to speak to your
one true love privately...

1133
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:28,895
we shall cover our ears.

1134
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:30,030
One true love?

1135
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,768
You told them
I'm your one true love?

1136
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:40,672
Is now a good or bad time
to tell you...

1137
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:43,710
about the crush I've had on you
for the last five years?

1138
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:45,876
Really?

1139
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:50,108
Yeah, I totally have a crush on you.

1140
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:53,187
Is that why you bring the mail cart around,
but none of the mail is for me?

1141
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:54,823
Yeah...

1142
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:56,620
yeah.

1143
01:10:00,262 --> 01:10:02,662
I told everybody
that you were my girlfriend.

1144
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:04,264
It's really embarrassing.

1145
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:05,900
I think it's kind of sweet.

1146
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:10,595
We must focus
because we have to book...

1147
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:13,537
to the boat and get out of here.
We're surrounded by little people.

1148
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:14,471
Darcy, listen to me.

1149
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:18,773
I would love to book with you
over to the boat right now, but I can't.

1150
01:10:18,948 --> 01:10:22,315
These little people have grown
very large in my heart.

1151
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:23,951
They depended on me...

1152
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:25,416
and I let them down.

1153
01:10:25,621 --> 01:10:27,555
And I have to do this first.

1154
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:36,127
King...

1155
01:10:36,298 --> 01:10:39,426
if it's all right with you, I'd like
to be your glorious protector again.

1156
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:41,301
I don't know.

1157
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:43,768
How are we to believe
anything you say, Gulliver?

1158
01:10:43,939 --> 01:10:46,499
Because my word is my bond.

1159
01:10:46,675 --> 01:10:48,267
This time, for real.

1160
01:10:49,044 --> 01:10:50,944
I promise.

1161
01:10:51,113 --> 01:10:52,171
Gulliver.

1162
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:56,979
You work in the mailroom.

1163
01:10:57,987 --> 01:10:59,855
Not today I don't.

1164
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,901
We're all with you, Gulliver.

1165
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:41,486
Hey, Edward.

1166
01:11:43,699 --> 01:11:45,462
If I win...

1167
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:48,136
Lilliput returns to her former glory.

1168
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:49,896
And if you lose...

1169
01:11:51,073 --> 01:11:52,734
this is what happens to Lilliput.

1170
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:13,091
I've made a slight improvement.

1171
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:19,899
Shocking, isn't it?

1172
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:26,032
Yeah!

1173
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:29,200
Hey! That's not fair. He's cheating.

1174
01:12:29,745 --> 01:12:31,679
I've got to do something.

1175
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:37,279
Now do what you do best...

1176
01:12:37,453 --> 01:12:39,580
beast, and run along!

1177
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:42,720
No way. Not today.

1178
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:47,223
I've always liked you, Gulliver.

1179
01:12:47,396 --> 01:12:49,921
I've always thought
we had a real spark!

1180
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,261
Fear not, Gulliver! I'm on my way!

1181
01:13:22,498 --> 01:13:23,726
Gulliver! No!

1182
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:27,429
Now stay down this time, beast!

1183
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:52,623
It is on!

1184
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:04,496
Go, Gulliver!

1185
01:14:04,673 --> 01:14:06,038
Yes, Gulliver! Go!

1186
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:11,608
Yes!

1187
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:13,941
Go on, Gulliver!
You can do it! Get him!

1188
01:14:21,523 --> 01:14:22,319
Help-eth.

1189
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,494
Bouche!

1190
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:34,161
Now, that's a wedgie!

1191
01:14:34,336 --> 01:14:35,803
Yay, Gulliver!

1192
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:37,370
- Yes! Well done!
- Come on, Gulliver!

1193
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,069
- You did it!
- Did you see that?

1194
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:45,147
I wedgied him back
to the second grade!

1195
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:01,921
I'm so, so sorry.

1196
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:05,556
I hope that you can forgive me
for the way that I behaved.

1197
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:08,564
You're not an option...

1198
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:13,007
you're the most beautiful lady
in all the land.

1199
01:15:15,143 --> 01:15:16,337
Who's also super cool...

1200
01:15:17,412 --> 01:15:19,107
and a stone-cold fox.

1201
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:26,749
Horatio!

1202
01:15:26,922 --> 01:15:28,617
Do you realize what you've done?

1203
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:34,395
You have committed
an act of valiance.

1204
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:37,190
I hereby...
give my permission.

1205
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:49,460
Yeah.

1206
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:53,400
Nobody move!

1207
01:15:53,415 --> 01:15:54,473
Halt! Stop!

1208
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:58,416
I have kidnapped the princess. You have
been kidnapped. Congratulations.

1209
01:15:58,587 --> 01:16:00,646
Enough with the kidnappings!

1210
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,686
Bouche!

1211
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:07,294
- Bouche!
- Yes!

1212
01:16:09,698 --> 01:16:11,222
Listen, I plagiarized all that stuff...

1213
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,561
because I thought you'd never go out
with a dude from the mailroom.

1214
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:15,794
And I'm sorry,
that will never happen again.

1215
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:24,876
So, yeah, coffee...

1216
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:27,416
I condemn you and all Blefuscians
to the gallows.

1217
01:16:27,549 --> 01:16:29,808
- Prepare for war!
- No...

1218
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:31,009
you prepare for war!

1219
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:34,688
I have to do one more thing,
real quick.

1220
01:16:34,856 --> 01:16:36,448
Kings, kings, come on!

1221
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:37,990
Guys, what is it with you...

1222
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,491
and the executions...

1223
01:16:39,661 --> 01:16:42,255
and the gallows and the stocks...

1224
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:43,762
...and the war?

1225
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:45,661
Seriously, war?

1226
01:16:45,867 --> 01:16:48,529
Why do war? What is it good for?

1227
01:16:48,904 --> 01:16:50,303
Absolutely naught!

1228
01:16:52,341 --> 01:16:53,308
War!

1229
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:57,537
Yeah
What is it good for?

1230
01:16:57,713 --> 01:16:58,941
Absolutely naught!

1231
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:00,706
Say it again, y'all

1232
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:01,883
War!

1233
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:03,913
Good God, y'all

1234
01:17:04,086 --> 01:17:05,713
What is it good for?

1235
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:08,481
I find it good for absolutely nil!

1236
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:13,055
It's an enemy to all mankind

1237
01:17:13,695 --> 01:17:17,028
The point of war blows my mind

1238
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:19,463
Life is much too short and precious

1239
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:21,034
To spend fighting wars these days

1240
01:17:22,037 --> 01:17:23,629
War can't give life

1241
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:25,238
It can only take it away

1242
01:17:26,241 --> 01:17:27,208
War!

1243
01:17:27,909 --> 01:17:28,876
Good God, y'all

1244
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:32,506
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing!

1245
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:34,346
Say it again, y'all

1246
01:17:34,516 --> 01:17:35,505
War!

1247
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:37,579
Yeah

1248
01:17:37,753 --> 01:17:39,243
What is it good for?

1249
01:17:39,955 --> 01:17:41,320
Absolutely nothing

1250
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,386
Listen to me

1251
01:17:43,558 --> 01:17:45,822
Peace, love and understanding

1252
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:47,985
Tell me, is there no place

1253
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:50,256
For them today?

1254
01:17:51,933 --> 01:17:54,834
They say we must fight
To keep our freedom

1255
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:58,905
But Lord knows
There's got to be a better way

1256
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:00,933
War!

1257
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:03,007
Good God, y'all

1258
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:05,043
What is it good for?

1259
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:06,009
Tell me

1260
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:08,513
Say it, say it, say oh!

1261
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:09,878
War!

1262
01:18:10,052 --> 01:18:11,246
Good God, y'all

1263
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:14,389
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing

1264
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:16,917
Just stand up and shout it!

1265
01:18:37,813 --> 01:18:39,838
You're gonna miss your big friend?

1266
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:41,644
A little.

1267
01:18:41,817 --> 01:18:42,943
- Yeah?
- A lot.

1268
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:44,415
Oh, dear.

1269
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:04,303
How was Papua, New Guinea?

1270
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:06,771
It was hot, sticky...

1271
01:19:06,942 --> 01:19:10,105
and the most mind-boggling place
I've ever seen.

1272
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:13,806
The most mind-boggling place
you've ever seen?

1273
01:19:14,049 --> 01:19:16,984
Okay, second most
mind-boggling place.

1274
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:18,682
Sorry.

1275
01:19:18,854 --> 01:19:19,752
Danny!

1276
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:21,183
Got your morning mail, Gulliver.

1277
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:23,918
- Darcy.
- Who's your friend?

1278
01:19:24,626 --> 01:19:27,356
I'm Mark.
I'm just the new guy in the mailroom.

1279
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:29,362
Whoa, just the mailroom?

1280
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:31,362
Mailrooms are where it's at.
Right, Dan?

1281
01:19:31,533 --> 01:19:33,763
Yeah, I don't know why
you would say that.

1282
01:19:33,935 --> 01:19:35,425
That's where all the greats start.

1283
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:38,299
Remember, there's no small jobs.

1284
01:19:38,473 --> 01:19:40,600
Just small people.

1285
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:44,371
Teeny, tiny, teeny little people.

1286
01:19:45,147 --> 01:19:47,240
Remember I told you that?
There are no small jobs.

1287
01:19:47,415 --> 01:19:48,507
Just tiny, tiny, people.

1288
01:19:48,683 --> 01:19:49,945
Can I take you to lunch?

1289
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:51,415
Of course you can...

1290
01:19:54,022 --> 01:19:55,785
my fair princess.
