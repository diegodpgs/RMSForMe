2
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,887
- Good morning, Miss Ratched.
- Good morning.

3
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,806
- Good morning, Miss Ratched.
- Mr. Washington.

4
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,433
- Morning.
- Morning.

5
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,566
- Good morning, Miss Ratched.
- Good morning.

6
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:35,904
- Morning, Bancini.
- Good morning.

7
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,788
How you feel?

8
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,457
Rested.

9
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:07,769
Medication time. Medication time.

10
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,421
Okay, move it up.

11
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,675
Mr. Fredrickson, just be careful now.

12
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,441
Juice.

13
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,156
Chief.

14
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,835
Okay, my friend, let's go.

15
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:38,568
Here's his papers,
and I'm gonna need a signature.

16
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,251
Hi.

17
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:43,467
- Mr. McMurphy's here.
- All right.

18
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,972
Thank you.

19
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:03,445
- All right, I'm ready.
- Okay. One pair of socks.

20
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,948
T-shirt.

21
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,206
Hi.

22
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,003
Goddamn, boy, you're about
as big as a mountain.

23
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,714
Look like you might have played
some football.

24
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,549
What's your name?

25
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:30,764
He... He can't hear you.
He's de... Deaf and dumb Indian.

26
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,475
Is that so?

27
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,185
Come on, Bibbit.

28
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,146
Can't even make a sound, huh?

29
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,816
How.

30
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,159
Come on, Billy.

31
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,161
Club lead. Jack of clubs.

32
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:01,294
- What's your name, son?
- Bill... Billy Bibbit.

33
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:04,339
Glad to know you, Bill.
McMurphy's mine.

34
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,968
That's old Charlie Cheswick's cards.

35
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,513
- Ha-ha.
- That's his ace of spades.

36
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,849
Your turn, Bill.

37
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,684
Big 10.

38
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,980
- Put one of them on it, will you?
- Wait a minute.

39
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,278
Oh, I can win that one.

40
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,863
- I win.
- Oh, you over-trumped?

41
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,239
- Sure.
- Pinochle, huh, Bill?

42
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,241
- You're avoiding spades?
- Mm-hm.

43
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:35,495
- Oh, okay. You sure you're avoiding spades?
- What's the bid?

44
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,915
- I know how to play the game.
- Five... Five-fifty.

45
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:45,672
Oh, uh, you like to look
at other people's cards, do you?

46
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,718
- Yes.
- Ever seen this one?

47
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,728
- Come on, Martini.
- Martini.

48
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,190
Martini, will you...?
Will you play a club?

49
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,488
Whose turn is it now?

50
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,032
Well, let's see, he trumped.
Where you going?

51
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,576
- Aren't you gonna play?
- What's the matter with him?

52
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,078
- Aren't you gonna play, Martini?
- What's...?

53
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:20,832
- Martini? I wanna play.
- You took a trump. You got... It's your lead.

54
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,337
Billy? Billy, I wanna
win some.... I....

55
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,672
Get a grip on yourself, will you?

56
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,302
Yes?

57
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:37,057
- Mr. McMurphy's here, doc.
- Good, have him come in.

58
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,020
Thank you.

59
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,272
McMurphy, I'm Dr. Spivey.

60
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,566
Dr. Spivey, what a pleasure
it is to meet you.

61
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,945
- Sure. Pull up a chair, sit down, let's talk.
- Sure.

62
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,874
R.P. McMurphy.

63
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,960
That's a hell of a fish there, doc.

64
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:08,713
- Isn't that a dandy?
- Yeah. It's about 40 pounds, ain't it?

65
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,757
- No, 32.
- Thirty-two.

66
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,343
I'll tell you, it took every
bit of strength I had...

67
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,595
...to hold it while the guy took the picture.

68
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:16,805
Every damn bit.

69
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,683
Probably that chain
didn't help it any either.

70
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,893
You didn't weigh the chain, did you, doc?

71
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,772
No, I didn't weigh the chain, but damn,
I'm awful proud of that picture.

72
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,317
That's the first Chinooker
I ever caught.

73
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,778
- It's a nice one.
- Hmm.

74
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,911
Randall Patrick McMurphy.

75
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,289
Thirty-eight years old.

76
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,841
What can you tell me about, uh...

77
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,801
...why you've been sent over here?

78
00:09:57,054 --> 00:10:00,599
Well, ahem, I don't know.

79
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,018
What's it say there?

80
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,770
- Mind if I smoke?
- No, go right ahead.

81
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,107
Well, it, um...

82
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,359
...says several things here.

83
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,531
Said you've been belligerent...

84
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,035
...talked when unauthorized...

85
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:24,873
...you've been resentful in attitude
toward work in general, that you're lazy.

86
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,667
Chewing gum in class.

87
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,882
The real reason
you've been sent over here...

88
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,760
...is because they wanted you
to be evaluated.

89
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,511
- Yeah.
- To determine whether or not...

90
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,055
...you're mentally ill.

91
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,557
This is the real reason.

92
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:46,061
Why do you think
they might think that?

93
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,900
Well, as near as I can figure out,
it's because I, uh....

94
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,903
Uh, fight and fuck too much.

95
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,404
In the penitentiary?

96
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,198
No, no, no, you mean why...
Wait...

97
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,910
Why did you get sent over here
from the work farm?

98
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,829
Oh. Oh, yeah. Oh. Uh....

99
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:08,333
Well, I really don't know, doc.

100
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,502
It says here that you went around...

101
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,338
- Let me just take a look.
- It ain't up to me, you know.

102
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:19,427
One, two, three, four....

103
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:25,266
- You've got at least five arrests for assault.
- Yeah.

104
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:29,104
- What can you tell me about that?
- Five fights, huh?

105
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:33,400
Rocky Marciano's got 40,
and he's a millionaire.

106
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,319
- That's true.
- That is true.

107
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,282
Of course, it's true that you went in
for statutory rape.

108
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,326
That's true, is it not, this time?

109
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,329
Absolutely true. But, doc...

110
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:50,291
...she was 1 5 years old
going on 35, doc...

111
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,628
...and, uh, she told me
she was 1 8, and she was...

112
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,505
...uh, very willing.
You know what I mean?

113
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,465
- Mm. Mm.
- I practically had to take...

114
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,759
...to sewing my pants shut.

115
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:04,097
But, uh, between you and me, uh...

116
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,393
...she might have been 1 5.
When you get that little red beaver...

117
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,646
...right up there in front of you,
I don't think it's crazy at all.

118
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,649
- And I don't think you do either.
- I hear what you're saying.

119
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:18,695
No man alive could resist that.
That's why I got into jail to begin with.

120
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,989
Now they're telling me
I'm crazy over here...

121
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,658
...because I don't sit there
like a goddamn vegetable.

122
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,827
It don't make a bit of sense to me.

123
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,912
If that's what being crazy is...

124
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,708
...then I'm senseless, out of it,
gone down the road, wacko.

125
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,335
But no more, no less. That's it.

126
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:40,592
Well, to be honest with you,
McMurphy, what it says here...

127
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,637
...is that...

128
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,806
...they think....

129
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,058
They think...

130
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:53,813
...you've been faking it
in order to get out of your work detail.

131
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:58,902
- What do you think about that?
- Do I look like that kind of guy to you, doc?

132
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,029
Well....

133
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:06,034
Let's just be frank for a minute,
Randall, if you would.

134
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,827
Tell me...

135
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:12,123
...do you think there's anything
wrong with your mind, really?

136
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,709
Not a thing, doc.

137
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,378
I'm a goddamn marvel of modern science.

138
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:26,054
Well, you're gonna be here for a
period for us to evaluate you.

139
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,015
- We're gonna study you.
- Mm-hm.

140
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:33,228
We'll make our determinations as
to what, uh, we're going to do...

141
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:36,147
...and give you the necessary treatment, uh...

142
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,775
- ...as indicated...
- Doc, let me just tell you this.

143
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,362
I'm here to cooperate with you
100 percent.

144
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,988
A hundred percent.

145
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,991
I'll be just right down
the line with you. You watch.

146
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:53,748
Because I think we ought to get
to the bottom of, uh, R.P. McMurphy.

147
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,722
The scythe.

148
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,645
- Oh.
- I'm awfully tired.

149
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,564
- Sit down.
- I'm tired.

150
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,732
Well, sit down.

151
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,278
That better?

152
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,457
Mr. Ellsworth...

153
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,294
...you'll wear yourself out.
Come here.

154
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,462
Okay.

155
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,300
<i>All right, gentlemen, let's begin.</i>

156
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,512
At the close of Friday's meeting...

157
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,641
...we were discussing
Mr. Harding's problem concerning his wife.

158
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,271
Mr. Harding stated that his wife
made him uneasy...

159
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,983
...because she drew stares
from men on the street.

160
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:08,239
- Is that correct, Mr. Harding?
- Yes. Uh, yes. That's correct.

161
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:12,118
He also thinks he may have
given her reason...

162
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:17,123
...to seek sexual attention elsewhere,
but he wasn't able to say how.

163
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,170
Mr. Harding has been heard
to say to his wife:

164
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:26,090
"I hate you.
I don't ever want to see you again.

165
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,343
You've betrayed me."

166
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:33,848
So does anyone care to
touch on this further?

167
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:54,077
Mr. Scanlon, would you begin today?

168
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,373
Are you sure?

169
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,879
Billy, how about you?

170
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,884
No... No... No, ma'am.

171
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:13,805
I'd like to write in my book
that you began the meeting.

172
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,016
Just once.

173
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:31,698
Mr. Martini?

174
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,201
Are you with us?

175
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,746
Yes.

176
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,291
Would you like to begin?

177
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,429
Mr. Cheswick?

178
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,315
- Me?
- Yes.

179
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:15,950
You mean there's not a man here
who has an opinion on this matter?

180
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,873
All right.

181
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,708
Mr. Harding...

182
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,252
...you've stated
on more than one occasion...

183
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,130
...that you suspected your wife
of seeing other men.

184
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,717
Oh, yes. Yes, very much...
I suspect her.

185
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,218
I suspect her.

186
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:39,474
Well, maybe you can tell us why
you suspect her.

187
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,521
Well, I can only...

188
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:48,149
...speculate as to the reasons why.

189
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,279
Have you ever speculated,
Mr. Harding...

190
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,698
...that perhaps you are...

191
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,283
...impatient with your wife...

192
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:01,287
...because she doesn't meet
your mental requirements?

193
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,667
Perhaps, but you see,
the only thing I can really...

194
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,503
...speculate on, Nurse Ratched...

195
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:15,009
...is the very existence of my life,
with or without my wife...

196
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:19,764
...in terms of the human relationships,
the juxtaposition...

197
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,850
...of one person to another,
the form, the content.

198
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:26,562
Harding, why don't you knock off
the bullshit and get to the point?

199
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,314
This is the point.

200
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:31,067
This is the point, Taber.
It's not bullshit.

201
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,570
I'm not just talking about my wife,
I'm talking about my life.

202
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,614
I can't seem to get that
through to you.

203
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,867
I'm not just talking about one person,
I'm talking about everybody.

204
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,745
I'm talking about form.
I'm talking about content.

205
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,664
I'm talking about interrelationships.

206
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,542
I'm talking about God, the devil,
hell, heaven.

207
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,545
- Do you understand? Finally?
- Ha!

208
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,005
Yeah, Harding, you're so fucking dumb
I can't believe it.

209
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,885
It makes me feel very peculiar,
very peculiar...

210
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,220
- ...when you throw in that.
- Peculiar?

211
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,056
- Why?
- What does that mean, peculiar, Harding?

212
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:05,017
- Peculiar? Peculiar?
- Peculiar?

213
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,937
- Ha-ha-ha.
- I'm going to tell you guys something.

214
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,939
You just don't wanna learn anything.

215
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,024
You just don't want
to listen to anybody.

216
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,734
He's got intelligence.

217
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,821
You've never heard the word peculiar?
Say, what are you trying to say?

218
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,241
You trying to say I'm queer?
Is that it?

219
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,202
Little Mary Ann?
Little Marjorie Jane? Huh?

220
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,496
That it?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

221
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,748
Is that your idea of communicating
something?

222
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,168
Well, is it?

223
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,503
They're all crowding in on you,
Mr. Harding.

224
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,881
- They're all ganging up on you.
- Is that news?

225
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:39,260
No, they... They sometimes wanna
gang up on me too, but I...

226
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,429
- Cheswick, do me a favor.
- What? Huh?

227
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,139
- Take it easy.
- Take it...?

228
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,558
- And stay off my side.
- But I only wanna...

229
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,268
I only wanna help you.

230
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,270
- I understand.
- Don't you want me to...?

231
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,772
- Please.
- But I only wanna...

232
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,108
- Please.
- But I only wanna help you.

233
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,610
Please!

234
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,780
You see...

235
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,533
...the other day you made
some allusions, both of you.

236
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,952
- Illusions?
- A sexual... Yes, allusions.

237
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,122
Allusions. Not illusions. Allusions...

238
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,958
...to sexual problems
I might be having with my wife.

239
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,378
All right, say it's true.
Say I know it to be true, but you don't.

240
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,964
If that's your idea of trying
to tell me something...

241
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,384
Harding, I think you're some
kind of morbid asshole or something.

242
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,636
- Peculiar.
- Asshole again.

243
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,095
It makes you feel peculiar.

244
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:26,349
You been talking about your wife ever
since I can remember. She's on your mind.

245
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,976
- Blah, blah, blah.
- I'm not talking about my wife.

246
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:31,270
When are you gonna get that
through your head?

247
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,814
When are you gonna wise up
and turn her loose?

248
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,108
- Please.
- No, just peculiar.

249
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:39,820
- I'm tired.
- I don't wanna hear it.

250
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,156
- I don't wanna hear it.
- I'm tired.

251
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,116
- I don't wanna hear it.
- I'm tired.

252
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,868
- It's a lot of baloney.
- I don't wanna hear it.

253
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,454
It's a lot of baloney and I'm tired.

254
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,916
- I don't wanna hear it.
- We know you're tired. We're tired.

255
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:56,087
- I'm tired and it's a lot of baloney.
- You're not tired, Bancini.

256
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,966
Take your hands off me.

257
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:29,370
<i>Recreation time, gentlemen.</i>

258
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,746
<i>The bus is waiting.</i>

259
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:36,043
<i>All non-restricted patients</i>
<i>please report to the bus.</i>

260
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,901
Ever play this game, Chief?

261
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:07,158
Come on, I'll show you.

262
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,618
Old Indian game.

263
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:14,665
It's called, uh,
Put the Ball in the Hole.

264
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,169
Now, that ought to be...
Just hold it right there.

265
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,378
All right.

266
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,756
Now, that's your spot. Don't move.

267
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,216
Never move. That's your spot,
you understand?

268
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,427
Right there. You don't move. Now...

269
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,429
...take the ball.

270
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,557
Here, take the ball.

271
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,101
That's it. Hold on to it.

272
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,854
Not too hard, Chief.
You'll crush all the air out of it.

273
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,523
We're gonna put her in the basket.
You understand?

274
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:43,402
All right.
Now, uh, raise up your arms.

275
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,113
Raise the ball up in the air, Chief.
Raise it up.

276
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:50,868
McMurphy, what you talking to him for?
He can't hear a fucking thing.

277
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,789
I ain't talking to him. I'm talking to myself.
It helps me think.

278
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,957
Yeah, well, it don't help him none.

279
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,294
Well, it don't hurt him either, does it?

280
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,797
Don't hurt you, does it, Chief?

281
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,799
See? Don't hurt him.

282
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:10,262
All right, now, Chief, uh....

283
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,308
Let's raise our hands up in the air.
Just raise them up.

284
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,561
Up, you understand?
Raise the hands up, here.

285
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,605
Up. Raise your hands up.

286
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,900
Up. That's it. That's it.
Up, all the way up.

287
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:27,279
All the way up.
That's a baby, all right. Huh?

288
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,740
Okay, now, uh....

289
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:33,202
Now, jump up in the air,
and put it in the basket, Chief.

290
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,996
Jump up and dunk it in.

291
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:40,292
Jump up in the air and stuff
that son of a bitch in there, Chief.

292
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,879
Take a rest, Chief.

293
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:48,217
Just stay right there. Take a rest.
I'll be right back.

294
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,348
Bancini, come here a minute.

295
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,017
You're looking all right.
Get right over here for a second.

296
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:59,270
Now, just stand right there.

297
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,647
Just get down a little bit.
All right. Stand up.

298
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,149
Stand up. Go ahead.

299
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,693
Whoo. That's a baby.
All right, you got her.

300
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,611
All right. Now, over there.

301
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:12,366
Hit me, Chief. I got the moves.
I got them, Chief.

302
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,326
Hold it right there. Give me the ball.

303
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,704
Give me the ball. That's it.
Thank you, Chief.

304
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,539
Now, hold it right there.

305
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:22,710
Now, you take the ball, you jump up
and put it in the basket.

306
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,796
See what I mean? Put it...
Bancini, hold still.

307
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,715
All right, Chief, here. Take the ball.

308
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:32,052
Now, jump up and put her
in the basket, Chief. Huh?

309
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,181
Jump up and put her in the basket!
Not you, Bancini.

310
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,183
Raise up... Bancini, where you going?

311
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,976
- I'm tired. I'm tired.
- Where... ? No.

312
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:43,147
Fast break. Defense. Get back. back.

313
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,108
Come on, Bancini, where
the fuck you going at?

314
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,402
- General, get this man around here.
- Aah! Aah!

315
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,156
- That's it, back. Over to Chief.
- Oh, I'm tired.

316
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:56,952
Fast break. Fast break.
Hit me, Chief. Hit me, baby.

317
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,622
Put it in the basket, Chief!

318
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,082
Put it in the basket!

319
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,682
Thirty-eight....

320
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,644
All right.

321
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,563
Make the bets.

322
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:27,316
- What's this?
- Make the bets.

323
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,944
It's a dime, Martini.

324
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,279
I bet a nickel.

325
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,199
A dime's the limit, Martini.

326
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:39,453
I bet a dime.

327
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,961
This is not a dime, Martini.

328
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,631
This is a dime.

329
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,466
If you break it in half...

330
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,970
...you don't get two nickels,
you get shit.

331
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:59,306
Try and smoke it. You understand?

332
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,308
- Yes.
- You don't understand.

333
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,685
All right, here they come.

334
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:05,688
Queen to the Chesser,
big bull to Tabelations...

335
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:09,108
...10 to Billy to match his whang,
and the dealer gets a three.

336
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,485
Hit me. Hit me.

337
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,320
- Hit me. I bet a dime.
- I can't hit you...

338
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,447
...because it ain't your turn yet.
You understand?

339
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:18,492
You see these other people?
These are the real ones.

340
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,537
These are real people here.

341
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,999
What'll you do, Ches? Hit or sit?

342
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,007
Hit me.

343
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,175
That's 23 up, Cheswick.

344
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,428
All right, Taber, you're busted.
Give me this.

345
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,972
- Twenty-three...
- Uh? Hit?

346
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,640
- Hit me.
- Shut up!

347
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:42,850
Taber.

348
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,852
- Give me a dime.
- I'm next, Taber.

349
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,479
You're not next. Huh?

350
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:49,273
- Hit me.
- Ace.

351
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,109
- Hit me.
- That's four or 1 4.

352
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,696
Don't want any more. Billy?

353
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,990
- Hit me. Hit me.
- All right, five.

354
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,367
- Hit me. Hit me.
- Huh?

355
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:04,038
You didn't make a bet, Martini.
I can't hit you. Jesus Christ.

356
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,456
- Huh?
- I bet a dime.

357
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,874
All right, here. Go ahead.

358
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,959
- That's 20 showing.
- No.

359
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,919
- Take your money.
- No.

360
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,129
It's not.

361
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:16,675
It's 10, 11, 12, 13.

362
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,720
This is a fucking queen here, you understand?

363
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:24,016
Hit me.

364
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:25,893
You got 20 showing.

365
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,020
Hit me again. I want another card.

366
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:32,149
- Scanlon, who's pitching the opener?
- Mac? Mac? Mac, here.

367
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,901
Medication time.

368
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:38,072
- This isn't a queen.
- Medication time, gentlemen. Medication.

369
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:41,116
- Mac, hit me.
- Who's the...?

370
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,160
- Who's pitching the opener?
- Hit me.

371
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,662
Jesus Christ Almighty.

372
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,164
Do you nuts wanna play cards
or you wanna jerk off?

373
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,415
Play the game.

374
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,834
I can't even hear myself think already.

375
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,053
Aah! Stay back.

376
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,554
Excuse me, ma'am. I just wanted to...

377
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,181
- Stay back.
- Mr. McMurphy.

378
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,475
Patients aren't allowed
in the nurses' station.

379
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:09,186
Well, I just, ahem,
wanted to, uh, turn...

380
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:13,399
When you're outside, we'll discuss
whatever problem you have, okay?

381
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:18,112
Patients are not allowed
in the nurses' station. All right?

382
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,155
Yes, ma'am.

383
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,365
Billy.

384
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:25,619
Let me get in here, will you, Hard-on?
Thank you. Excuse me, miss.

385
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,914
Do you think it might be possible
to turn that music down...

386
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:32,584
...so maybe a couple of the boys
could talk?

387
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:36,171
That music is for everyone, Mr. McMurphy.

388
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:39,216
I know, but do you think
we might ease it down a little bit...

389
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:43,303
...so maybe the boys
didn't have to shout? Huh?

390
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,097
What you probably don't realize...

391
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,975
...is that we have a lot of old men
on this ward...

392
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:51,145
...who couldn't hear the music
if we turned it lower.

393
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:54,481
That music is all they have.

394
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,067
Your hand is staining my window.

395
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:02,990
- Oh. I'm sorry, ma'am. Really sorry.
- All right.

396
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:07,202
- Mr. McMurphy, your medication.
- Huh?

397
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:10,831
- What's in the horse pill?
- It's just medicine. It's good for you.

398
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:15,085
Yeah, but I don't like the idea of taking
something if I don't know what it is.

399
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:19,923
- Don't get upset, Mr. McMurphy.
- I'm not getting upset, Miss Pilbow.

400
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:25,345
It's just that I don't want anyone
to try and slip me saltpeter.

401
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:26,513
You know what I mean?

402
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,558
It's all right, Nurse Pilbow.

403
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:33,687
If Mr. McMurphy doesn't want
to take his medication orally...

404
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:37,775
...I'm sure we can arrange
that he can have it some other way.

405
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:43,113
But I don't think you'd like it,
Mr. McMurphy.

406
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:48,035
You'd like it, wouldn't you, Hard-on?
Give it to me.

407
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:50,704
Good.

408
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,170
Very good.

409
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,882
Mm, yummy.

410
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:08,305
Mr. Harding?

411
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,947
Tell me, lover boy...

412
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:28,158
...why didn't you tell her
to go fuck herself?

413
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,749
Jesus Christ.

414
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,920
Okay. Funny, huh? That's funny, huh?

415
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,422
You know, that wasn't very smart.
She could have seen that.

416
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,924
Yeah.

417
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:51,014
God Almighty, she's got
you guys coming or going.

418
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,767
What do you think she is?
Some kind of a champ or something?

419
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,769
No, I thought you were the champ.

420
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,981
Wanna bet?

421
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:01,149
Bet on what?

422
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,359
One week.

423
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,987
I bet in one week I can put a bug
so far up her ass...

424
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,197
...she don't know whether to shit
or wind her watch.

425
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:10,284
What do you say to that? Wanna bet?
No, you wanna bet?

426
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,578
One week. That's all I need.
Who wants to bet?

427
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:16,039
You wanna bet? Bet a buck.
One buck. Huh?

428
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,916
I'll bet.

429
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:22,796
Tabes in, 1 buck. Solid.

430
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,883
Last time we were discussing...

431
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,218
...Mr. Harding and the problem
with his wife...

432
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,763
...and I think we were making
a lot of progress.

433
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:35,183
So who would like to begin today?

434
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,440
Mr. McMurphy?

435
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:45,944
Yeah, I've been thinking about
what you said about, uh...

436
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,656
...you know, getting things
off your chest.

437
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:52,659
And, uh.... Uh, ahem.

438
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:56,121
Well, there's a couple of things
that I'd like to get off my chest.

439
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,957
Well, that's very good,
Mr. McMurphy. Go ahead.

440
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,834
Okay.

441
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:04,421
Today, as you may or may not know...
It doesn't matter.

442
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,465
...is the opening of the World Series.

443
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:12,346
What I'd like to suggest is that
we change the work detail tonight...

444
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:15,349
...so that we can watch the ball game.

445
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,646
Well, Mr. McMurphy, what you're asking...

446
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:25,943
...is that we change a very
carefully worked-out schedule.

447
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:31,281
A little change never hurt, huh?
A little variety?

448
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:35,035
Well, it's not necessarily true,
Mr. McMurphy.

449
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:40,374
Some men on the ward take a long,
long time to get used to the schedule.

450
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:43,502
Change it now, and they
might find it very disturbing.

451
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:47,214
Ah, fuck the schedule. They can go back
to the schedule after the Series.

452
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:51,718
I'm talking about the World Series,
Nurse Ratched. Huh?

453
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:55,389
Well, anyway, this is no way
to proceed about this.

454
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:59,101
How would it be if we had a vote...

455
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,894
...and let majority rule?

456
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,563
Great. Let's vote on her.

457
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:09,236
So all those in favor, raise your hands.

458
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,074
Okay, guys, come on.

459
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,744
Put your hands up.

460
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:24,084
What's the matter with you?
Don't you wanna watch the World Series?

461
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,878
Come on, get your hands up.
It'll do you good...

462
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:30,716
...to get some exercise
putting your arms up in the air.

463
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,260
That's it. Come on, let's....

464
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,731
What is this crap?
I mean, I watch the Series.

465
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,691
I haven't missed the Series in years.

466
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:51,862
Even in the cooler. When I'm in the cooler,
they run it there or they have a riot.

467
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,824
What's the matter with you guys?
Come on, be good Americans.

468
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,706
Well, Mr. McMurphy,
I only count three votes...

469
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,959
...and that's not enough
to change ward policy.

470
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,419
I'm sorry.

471
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,843
My turn. Okay, hot dice.

472
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,887
I wanna get to go.

473
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,638
Because I need cash.

474
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:22,684
I wanna get to Mediterranean Avenue.
Big 10. Perfect.

475
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:27,773
Two fives. Two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine....

476
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,067
- What are you doing?
- Hotel.

477
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,652
- You do not have a hotel there.
- Hotel.

478
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,196
For the third time...

479
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,656
- ...you do not have a hotel on Boardwalk.
- Hotel.

480
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:40,285
- It costs $1.000 and four green houses...
- Hotel.

481
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,329
- ...to put a hotel on Boardwalk.
- Hotel.

482
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,538
Play the game.

483
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,373
- Knock off the bullshit.
- Huh?

484
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:48,126
- Play the game, Harding.
- What are you talking about?

485
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,420
- Play the game.
- I ain't doing anything to you.

486
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:51,838
- What bullshit?
- Your bullshit.

487
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,590
- Your bullshit?
- Play the game.

488
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,175
- Hands off me.
- Play the game.

489
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,469
- Enough bullshit. You hear me?
- Play the game.

490
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:00,680
- What the fuck are you picking on me for?
- Play the game, Harding.

491
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:03,141
- Look, I'm trying to ignore you.
- Just play the game.

492
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,018
Keep your hands off me.

493
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:08,230
- Keep your hands off me! You hear me?
- Play the game.

494
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:11,525
- Come on, come on, come on.
- I can be pushed just so far, see.

495
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:12,734
Play the game.

496
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,654
You touch me once more.
Just touch me once more.

497
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,031
Just once more, huh?
Just once more.

498
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,534
- Just touch me once more.
- Play the game, Harding.

499
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,577
Just touch me once more.

500
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,704
Holy Jesus.

501
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:46,059
Is that what your schedule
does for you, Hard-on? Huh?

502
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,770
Damn lunatic.

503
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:53,441
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No? Well, then stay all wet, Harding, huh?

504
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:56,820
Because I'm going downtown
and watch the World Series anyway.

505
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,405
Anybody wanna come with me?

506
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:03,410
- I do, Mac. I wanna go with you.
- Ches, all right. Anybody else?

507
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,496
- Where?
- Any bar downtown.

508
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,498
Mac... Mac, you can't...

509
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,877
Can't get... Can't get out of here.

510
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,005
Anybody wanna bet?

511
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,049
Hmm, chickenshits?

512
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:21,011
Maybe he'll just show Nurse Ratched
his big thing...

513
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,804
...and she'll open the door for him.

514
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,185
Yeah, maybe I will...

515
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:31,980
...and then maybe I'll just use your
thick skull and knock a hole in the wall.

516
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,732
Sefelt, see?

517
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,404
Why, my head would squash
like an eggplant.

518
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:44,034
Fuck Sefelt's head,
I don't need Sefelt's head.

519
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,453
I'm gonna take this,
put it through the window...

520
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,372
...and me and my buddy Cheswick
are gonna go out...

521
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,542
...downtown, sit down in a bar,
wet our whistles...

522
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,211
...and watch the ball game.

523
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:58,632
And that's the bet. Now, does
anybody want any of it? Huh?

524
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,259
You're gonna lift that thing?

525
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,804
Yeah. That's right.

526
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,724
I'll bet a buck.

527
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,894
Taber, $1.

528
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,979
I bet a dime.

529
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:18,151
Mac, you can't...
Can't li... Lift that thing.

530
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:22,614
Anybody else want any of it? Hard-on?

531
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,453
I'll bet $25.

532
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:31,331
Twenty-five dollars, Hard-on.

533
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:37,003
Mac! Mac, no...
Nobody could ever lift that thing.

534
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:39,464
Get out of my way, son.
You're using my oxygen.

535
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,174
You know what I mean?

536
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:46,680
All right.

537
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,360
Giving up?

538
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:06,283
No. Just warming up.

539
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:11,830
Warming up. Warming up.
This will be the one.

540
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,793
All right, baby. Come on.

541
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,551
Fucking thing.

542
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:06,676
But I tried, didn't I? Goddamn it.

543
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,346
At least I did that.

544
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:19,272
And on the mound,
<i>the left-hander Al Downing.</i>

545
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,692
<i>The two pitchers still warming up</i>
<i>right down below us.</i>

546
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,653
<i>The second game</i>
<i>of the 1 963 World Series...</i>

547
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:30,617
<i>...is being brought to you</i>
<i>from Yankee Stadium.</i>

548
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,623
<i>Did you tell the girl</i>
<i>how you felt about her?</i>

549
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,549
Well... Well, I went...

550
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,552
I went over to her house...

551
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,181
...one Sunday afternoon...

552
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:58,144
...and I brought...
Brought her some flowers.

553
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,402
And I said... I said:

554
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:10,490
"Celia, will you ma... ?"

555
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,497
"Ma... ? Marry me?"

556
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,350
Billy?

557
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,854
Why did you want to marry her?

558
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:48,194
Well, I was in lo...
In love with her.

559
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,115
Your mother told me
that you never told her about it.

560
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:06,212
Billy, why didn't you tell her about it?

561
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:23,605
Billy, wasn't that the first time
you tried to commit suicide?

562
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,656
Oh, my God.

563
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,742
Yes, Mr. Cheswick?

564
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,369
Miss Ratched...

565
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,497
...I'd like to ask you a question, please.

566
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,832
Go ahead.

567
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,085
Okay, uh....

568
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,463
You know, if, uh...

569
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,758
...Billy doesn't feel like, uh, talking...

570
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:55,845
...I mean, uh, why are you pressing him?

571
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,723
Why can't we go on to some new business?

572
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:03,269
The business of this meeting, Mr. Cheswick...

573
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,313
...is therapy.

574
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,778
Well, you know, I don't
understand this, Miss Ratched...

575
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,197
...because, uh, I don't, uh....

576
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,782
Mr. McMurphy...

577
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:20,620
...he said something yesterday
about a World Series.

578
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,747
A baseball game?

579
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:26,042
You know, and I've never
been to a baseball game...

580
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,254
...and, well, I think I'd like to see one...

581
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:34,133
...and that would be good therapy,
too, wouldn't it, Miss Ratched?

582
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,470
I thought we'd decided that issue.

583
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:43,101
Well, I don't think so, because, I mean...

584
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,979
...we discussed that yesterday...

585
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:49,983
...and we have a new game today,
I think, don't we, Mac?

586
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:54,320
That's right, Ches, and we want
a new vote on it, don't we?

587
00:42:57,449 --> 00:43:00,868
Would one more vote satisfy you, Mr. McMurphy?

588
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:02,537
Yeah.

589
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,747
It'll satisfy me.

590
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:08,209
There's a vote before the group.

591
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:13,339
Everyone in favor of changing
the schedule, please raise your hand.

592
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:19,721
Okay, I wanna see the hands.
Come on.

593
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:23,516
Which one of you nuts has got any guts?

594
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:34,861
- All right. That's it.
- I only count nine votes, Mr. McMurphy.

595
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:38,698
Ha-ha-ha. She only counts nine.
Only nine. It's a landslide.

596
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:44,287
There are 18 patients on
this ward, Mr. McMurphy...

597
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:47,665
...and you have to have a majority
to change ward policy.

598
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:52,211
So you gentlemen can
put your hands down now.

599
00:43:56,717 --> 00:44:00,261
Are you trying to tell me
that you're gonna count these?

600
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:03,973
These poor son of a bitches?
They don't know what we're talking about.

601
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:07,727
Well, I have to disagree
with you, Mr. McMurphy.

602
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:11,731
These men are members of
the ward, just as you are.

603
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,569
All right. All I need is one vote, right?

604
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,446
Right?

605
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:19,697
All right.

606
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,492
Okay.

607
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:26,204
Wanna watch the World Series?
Come on in, pal.

608
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:29,332
This could be a big moment for you.
Wanna watch a baseball game?

609
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,667
You wanna watch baseball?

610
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,044
Just raise that hand up.
Just raise the hand up.

611
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,380
- What do you say?
- I gave it all to her.

612
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:36,923
Sorry.

613
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,050
Bancini, old horse.

614
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:42,011
What do you say? You wanna watch
the ball game on TV? Huh?

615
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,472
Wanna watch the ball game?
Baseball? World Series?

616
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,973
- What do you say, pal?
- I'm tired.

617
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,183
You're tired?

618
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,977
Just raise your hand up, Bancini.
Watch the ball game, huh?

619
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:53,564
- I'm tired. Awfully tired.
- Okay. All right.

620
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:55,608
What about you, pal?

621
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:59,362
All we need's one vote. Just one vote.
Just your one vote. That's all we need.

622
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:04,575
Just raise your hand up, and your buddies
can watch the baseball game on....

623
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:14,585
General, you remember, don't you?
October, the banner, the stars.

624
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,173
The World Series.
Raise your hand up, Gen...

625
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:23,803
Just raise your hand up.

626
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:28,474
What about you pal, huh?
Wanna watch the ball game?

627
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:31,769
Wanna watch the ball game, huh?
Just one vote. Just raise your....

628
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:34,480
Gentlemen, the meeting is adjourned.

629
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:37,400
For chrissake, isn't there
one of you fucking maniacs...

630
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,819
- ...that knows what I'm talking about?
- Mr. McMurphy?

631
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,112
Huh?

632
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,739
The meeting is adjourned.

633
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,657
Just wait a minute.
Just one minute?

634
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,744
You can bring the subject up again tomorrow.

635
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,412
All right, Chief...

636
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:54,125
...you're our last chance. What do you say?
Huh? Just raise your hand up.

637
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:57,962
That's all we need from you today, Chief.
Just raise your hand up one time.

638
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:02,008
Show her that you can do it.
Just show her that you can still do it.

639
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,677
Just raise your hand up.
All the guys have got them up.

640
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:08,347
Just raise your hand up, Chief.
Will you? Huh?

641
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:15,521
Come on, there's gotta be one guy in here
that's not a total fucking nut.

642
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,398
Mac?

643
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,901
Chief. The Chief.

644
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:24,197
Chief! Nurse Ratched!
Nurse Ratched, look.

645
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:26,532
Look. The Chief put his hand up.

646
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,618
The Chief put his hand up.
Look, he voted.

647
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:32,205
Would you please turn...?
Would you please turn the television set on?

648
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:34,665
The Chief has got his hand up, right there.

649
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:40,630
The Chief voted. Now, will you
please turn the television set on?

650
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:41,881
Mr. McMurphy...

651
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,550
...the meeting was adjourned,
and the vote was closed.

652
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:48,262
But the vote was 10-to-8.
The Chief, he's got his hand up. Look.

653
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,597
No, Mr. McMurphy.

654
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:53,768
When the meeting was adjourned,
the vote was 9-to-9.

655
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:58,231
Ah, come on, you're not gonna say that
now. You're not gonna say that now.

656
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:02,151
You're gonna pull that shit now, when...
The Chief just voted. It was 10-to-9.

657
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:06,864
I want that television set turned on!
Right now!

658
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:12,995
Mr. Cheswick.

659
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,998
Come on. Come on.

660
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:19,210
- I wanna watch television.
- No, you have a work assignment.

661
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,566
- Koufax.
- Where's my sponge?

662
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:46,445
Koufax kicks. He delivers.
It's up the middle, it's a base hit.

663
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:50,283
Richardson's rounding first, going for
second. The ball's in to deep right center.

664
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,702
Davidson over in the corner.
Here comes the throw.

665
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,621
Richardson around the dirt.
Slides, he's in there! A double!

666
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:58,416
He's in there, Martini!
Richardson, he's on second base.

667
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:01,168
Koufax is in big fucking trouble.
Big trouble, baby.

668
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:03,462
All right, here's Tresh.
He's the next batter.

669
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,506
Tresh looks in. Koufax....

670
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:08,676
Koufax gets the sign from Roseboro.
He kicks once, he pumps.

671
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:12,555
It's a strike. Koufax's curve ball
is snapping off like a fucking firecracker.

672
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,473
Here he comes with the next pitch.

673
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:17,810
Tresh swings.
It's a long fly ball to deep left center!

674
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:22,315
- It's going! It's gone!
- Mr. Washington...

675
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:25,693
...and Mr. Warren, please see that
the men are doing their work.

676
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,739
Somebody get me a fucking
wiener before I die.

677
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:35,703
Koufax looks down. Looking at the great
Mickey Mantle now. Here comes the pitch.

678
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:39,206
Mantle swings.
It's a fucking home run!

679
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:42,043
Gentlemen, stop this.

680
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:45,254
Stop this immediately.

681
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,599
Do you like it here?

682
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,772
Well, that fucking nurse, man.

683
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,483
What do you mean, sir?

684
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:08,069
She, uh....

685
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:17,536
She ain't honest.

686
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,164
Oh, now, look.

687
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:24,585
Miss Ratched's one of the finest nurses
we've got in this institution.

688
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:30,466
Well, I don't wanna break up
the meeting or nothing...

689
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:33,511
...but she's something of a cunt,
ain't she, doc?

690
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:36,305
How do you mean that?

691
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:40,893
She likes a rigged game.
You know what I mean?

692
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:49,735
Well, you know, I've, uh,
been observing you here now...

693
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:51,529
...for the last four weeks...

694
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:56,325
...and I don't see any evidence
of mental illness at all.

695
00:49:56,493 --> 00:50:00,121
I think that you've been trying
to put us on all this time.

696
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:04,083
You know, what do you want me to do?
You know.

697
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:09,588
You know what I mean? Is that it?
Is that crazy enough for you?

698
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:13,759
Want me to take a shit on the floor?
Hmm. Christ.

699
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:17,930
Have you ever heard the old saying,
"A rolling stone gathers no moss"?

700
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,767
Yeah.

701
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,270
Does that mean something to you?

702
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:33,779
It's the same as "Don't wash
your dirty underwear in public."

703
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,574
I'm not sure I understand
what you mean.

704
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,703
I'm smarter than him, ain't I?

705
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:46,250
Well, that sort of
has always meant is, uh...

706
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:50,463
...it's hard for something to grow
on something that's moving.

707
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:54,425
How did you feel about
what happened yesterday?

708
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:02,892
Well, you wanna kill.
You know what I mean?

709
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,486
Do you gentlemen have
any more questions?

710
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:15,946
No, not at the moment.

711
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:18,949
I don't have any more,
but, uh, perhaps you do.

712
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,659
Do you have a question, McMurphy?

713
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:24,830
Where do you suppose she lives?

714
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:58,030
Chief, come on with me.

715
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,032
Come on.

716
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,035
We'll show these guys who's nuts.

717
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:07,164
All right, wait. Stand right here.

718
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:12,211
All right. Grab the fence.

719
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:14,338
Grab the fence here.

720
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:17,883
Right here, Chief. Strong.
Strong, like this, here.

721
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:26,976
That's it. All right. Okay. Up.

722
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:30,396
That's it. All right, you got it?

723
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:37,486
You do. This one.
Here. All right, push.

724
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,990
Come on, Bob.

725
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:25,326
Where you going?

726
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:30,080
Don't breathe on me, Club.
Keep moving. Keep moving.

727
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:35,878
Come on, you guys.
Get the lead out, huh?

728
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,472
Hey, what the hell's going on here?

729
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,641
Hey, wait a minute. Aah!

730
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:49,975
Hold it.

731
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:53,979
- See how easy it is?
- Oh! Whoa!

732
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:31,767
Boys...

733
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:38,607
...this here is Candy.
Candy, this is the boys.

734
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:40,859
Hi.

735
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,612
- Hi.
- Oh!

736
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,872
You all crazies?

737
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:21,275
Let's go. Down here.

738
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:24,653
- Isn't this wonderful?
- Right down here.

739
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:26,905
No problem.

740
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,490
Huh?

741
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:31,076
Right here. Come on.

742
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:34,705
Come on, we don't wanna be late
for our first day out.

743
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:42,588
Hello.

744
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:49,928
Come on, will youse?
What are you standing around for here?

745
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:52,431
Get on-board. Give them these, Candy.

746
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:58,520
Hey, wait a minute.
What the heck is going on here?

747
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:02,941
- What are you doing on this boat?
- We're going fishing.

748
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:05,277
No, you're not going fishing.

749
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:08,822
Not on this boat.
You're not going fishing on this boat.

750
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:12,284
Oh, yeah, on this boat.
Uh, ask Captain Block.

751
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:15,079
- Captain Block?
- Captain Block. Yes, that's right.

752
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:16,997
Who are you?

753
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:22,461
Uh, we're from the, uh,
state mental institution.

754
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:28,967
This is Dr. Cheswick, Dr. Taber,
Dr. Fredrickson...

755
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:32,596
...Dr. Scanlon.
The famous Dr. Scanlon.

756
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:35,474
Mr. Harding, Dr. Bibbit...

757
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:40,270
...Dr. Martini, and, uh, Dr. Sefelt.

758
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:46,485
- How about you? Who are you?
- Oh. I'm Dr. McMurphy. R.P. McMurphy.

759
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,243
Wait, wait, wait one second.
You don't understand.

760
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,870
We chartered the boat,
we're going to go fishing...

761
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:59,665
...and, uh, that's all there is to it.

762
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:09,341
You better quit on this. They'll throw you
in the can again, you know.

763
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,760
No, they won't. We're nuts.

764
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:16,557
They'll just take us back
to the feeb farm, see?

765
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:20,853
Von Sefelt, get the stern line.

766
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:24,189
- Tabes, you're at the bow.
- This one?

767
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:29,194
That one. The one at your feet.

768
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:39,037
Get back on. Jesus.

769
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:43,167
Tabes.

770
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:27,169
Cheswick.

771
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:30,255
Come here, quick.

772
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:39,264
Aye, aye, sir. I mean, yes, Mac.

773
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:42,726
Take it easy, Charlie.
You ever driven one of these things?

774
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:45,437
- Driven one of...?
- Yeah.

775
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:49,107
- No, Mac. I... I...
- Well, it's a lot of fun.

776
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:50,526
- Lot of fun.
- Come on over here.

777
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:51,735
Put your hands on the wheel.

778
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,612
- Put your hands on.
- I never did this.

779
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,823
Put your hands on the wheel
so you don't fall down. All right.

780
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:59,117
Just hold it steady
right there, like that.

781
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:00,494
- Steady?
- Steady, yeah.

782
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,120
Now just go straight.

783
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:04,456
- Straight as an arrow, Charlie.
- Straight, Mac?

784
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,959
- Just straight. That's right.
- But, Mac....

785
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:11,004
Mac, this thing
ain't too steady, Mac. Mac!

786
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:16,134
- Mac. Where are we going, Mac?
- Straight. Just go on.

787
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:28,063
This is the bait.

788
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:32,568
- Little fishes.
- Dead fishes.

789
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,319
That's right.

790
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:38,198
Now, what are we gonna do
with these little fishes?

791
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:43,996
- Catch big fishes.
- That's right. That's right, Mr. Martini.

792
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:48,000
And hooks.

793
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:49,960
Hooks.

794
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:55,841
Now, hold on to your hooks
because here are the fishes.

795
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:58,010
Tabes.

796
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:03,599
Get a fish here.
There, for you, Martini.

797
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:07,519
All right, now we each one of us
has got a fish.

798
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:11,940
What are you laughing at, Martini?
You're not an idiot, huh?

799
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:15,193
You're not a goddamn loony now, boy,
you're a fisherman. Ha-ha-ha.

800
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:20,324
- Yes. Yes.
- Huh? Now, take your bottom hook.

801
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:22,993
- You got it?
- Yes.

802
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:24,870
You take it...

803
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:30,709
...and you push it
all the way through. Like that.

804
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:33,462
Wait a second.
Get it through the eyes. Here.

805
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,589
- Right through here.
- In his eye?

806
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,799
Don't worry about it.
He's dead, Martini.

807
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:41,595
Jesus Christ, just put it
through his eyeball here.

808
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:42,929
That's it.

809
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:46,224
Crunch it right through.
All right. Now you got it, see?

810
01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:49,561
Now, you just pull that baby through.
You see what I mean?

811
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:53,190
And you wrap it around.
You pull this so it's a little loop.

812
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:54,566
- That's very good.
- Aah!

813
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:56,943
That's very good, Mr. Fredrickson.

814
01:00:57,111 --> 01:01:00,072
Very good eye work. Good eye work.

815
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:03,909
That little devil's gonna not even
feel the sting, is he, boy? Huh?

816
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:08,121
That son of a gun is gonna
bite on you, is he? Let me see that face.

817
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:13,794
You... You, um...
Got... Got... Got beautiful hair.

818
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,046
Thank you.

819
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:18,965
You gotta pull it tight like this.

820
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:20,926
And you... You, um, got...

821
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:26,473
Beautiful eyes.

822
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,893
Thank you. Heh-heh.

823
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:35,107
Billy, what's the matter?
Fishing don't grab you?

824
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:42,489
Yeah... Yeah...
They... They... They do.

825
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,658
Now, come on with me, over here.

826
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:48,537
I'm gonna give each and
every one of youse a rod.

827
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:56,712
All right. Here are your poles.

828
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:13,562
Now, just keep watching the tip here.
If you get a strike, let me know.

829
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:14,771
Understand?

830
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:18,233
Come on, Candy.
Just keep fishing, guys.

831
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:20,819
Don't call me unless you get
something really big...

832
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:23,905
...you can't handle yourselves.

833
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:28,660
Keep on fishing.

834
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:32,456
That's right.

835
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:02,652
Mac?

836
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:06,031
Hey! Where is everybody?

837
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:14,581
Hey. Hey!

838
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:22,255
Cheswick! Goddamn it, I told you
to steer that boat straight.

839
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:23,632
I tried to.

840
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,385
Fish!

841
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:31,556
Fish! Help, help!

842
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:36,353
Goddamn it, he's got a fish. Hold it!
Wait a minute, Tabes. I got it.

843
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:39,564
Cheswick, get the fuck back up there!
Get up there and drive!

844
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:41,399
- Fish!
- I got it, Tabes.

845
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:43,735
Get up, Tabes, I'll get it for you.

846
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:48,156
Son of a bitch, he's going over here!
Get up, Tabes!

847
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:53,745
I got it.

848
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:55,622
I got it. Give it to me.

849
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:59,584
- Hey, Harding, I'm the skipper of this boat.
- Ah, shut up.

850
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:02,504
Well, he said to go straight out
as an arrow.

851
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,923
You're not going straight,
you're kind of....

852
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:08,510
I'm going straight enough.
Now, Chessy, stop it.

853
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:12,389
- It's my duty.
- Chessy, stop it.

854
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:15,100
- No!
- Don't you...

855
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:18,395
No, you son of a bitch.

856
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:22,524
All right, Martini.

857
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:26,695
All right, take him over.
Take him over.

858
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:29,072
That's it. Now play them, boys.

859
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:31,783
You son of a bitches.

860
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:35,871
Keep it straight.

861
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:38,123
Come back this way.

862
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:12,782
Home safe and sound. Didn't lose a nut.

863
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:14,826
Beach bowling, you know what I mean?

864
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:18,622
We caught it, look.

865
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:20,665
They're gonna be trolling this place...

866
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:22,584
...for six months
looking for dead bodies.

867
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,171
We caught it. Look.

868
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:32,886
I think he's dangerous.

869
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:36,848
He's not crazy, but he's dangerous.

870
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:41,561
- You don't think he's crazy?
- No, he's not crazy.

871
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,773
Dr. Songee?

872
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:48,109
I don't think he's overly psychotic...

873
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:50,320
...but I still think he's quite sick.

874
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:54,866
- Do you think he's dangerous?
- Absolutely so.

875
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:59,871
Well, John, what do you wanna
do with him?

876
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:05,877
Well, I think we've had our turn.

877
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:10,715
I'd like to send him back
to the, uh, work farm, frankly.

878
01:06:11,592 --> 01:06:15,053
Is there anybody
that you have on your staff...

879
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:19,349
...that could relate to him?
Maybe understand him?

880
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:21,559
Help him out
with some of these problems?

881
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:25,480
Well, the funny thing is that
the person that he's the closest to...

882
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:27,857
...is the one
he dislikes the most. Heh.

883
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:29,693
- Well, sure.
- That's you, Mildred.

884
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:34,364
Well, gentlemen, in my opinion,
if we send him back to Pendleton...

885
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:37,909
...or we send him up to Disturbed...

886
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:43,248
...it's just one more way of passing on
our problem to somebody else.

887
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:46,042
You know we don't like to do that.

888
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:50,922
So I'd like to keep him on the ward.

889
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:53,967
I think we can help him.

890
01:06:56,637 --> 01:07:01,099
All right, huh? Chief. Chief, come on.

891
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:04,436
Come with me, huh? All right.

892
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:08,273
Now, Chief, this is the spot.

893
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:13,319
Right there is the spot. Remember?
Raise the hands, in the basket.

894
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:15,280
That's it. Raise the hands up.

895
01:07:15,614 --> 01:07:19,451
All right. Let's have a little ball
from you nuts in here. Here we go.

896
01:07:19,618 --> 01:07:22,579
All right. Let's play some ball, nuts.
Let's make some moves.

897
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:27,250
Hey, Mac, Mac. Time, time, time.
You got six men on the court.

898
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:31,671
All right. Harding, out of the ball game.

899
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:33,131
Hey, why me?

900
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:37,302
- Because I'm the coach. I'll put you in later.
- Oh, no, no. I don't trust you.

901
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:42,140
Ma... Mac, I'll go.

902
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:46,144
Okay, good boy, Billy.
I'll put you in in a minute, all right?

903
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:50,190
All right, let's play ball.
Harding, break over.

904
01:07:50,357 --> 01:07:53,568
All right, Martini, get it back.
I'm in the open. What are you doing?

905
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:55,487
You threw the damn ball into the fence!

906
01:07:55,654 --> 01:07:58,364
Christ Almighty, you threw
the ball into the fence!

907
01:07:58,532 --> 01:08:00,700
There's nobody there.
We're playing ball.

908
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:05,163
All right, come on, get in the game.
Defense, nobody's doing nothing here.

909
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:07,624
- For chrissake.
- Hey, Mac, I'm open. I'm open.

910
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:10,543
All right, Harding, give it back.
Back to me, Harding. Here.

911
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:12,796
I'm open.
Harding, will you give me the ball?

912
01:08:12,963 --> 01:08:15,006
- Stop dribbling the goddamn ball.
- I got it.

913
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:16,424
Harding, over here.

914
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:19,511
Oh, for chrissake, I'm standing...

915
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:21,179
- You were covered.
- I was open.

916
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:23,890
Just give me the ball.
They're making all over the...

917
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,809
I was open. Give me the ball.

918
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:31,189
- You were covered, Mac.
- I wasn't covered. Somebody get back.

919
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:33,358
- Give it to me. Give it to me.
- All right?

920
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:34,943
- Ow!
- Yeah, we're going.

921
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,779
Chief. Attababy, put it in.

922
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:43,952
Get down there.

923
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,412
- Defense.
- Hey!

924
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:50,959
Get down there, Chief.
All right, all right.

925
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,711
- Pick up somebody over there!
- Get this side.

926
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:55,213
Get around, Chief.

927
01:08:58,884 --> 01:09:01,553
No, no, no. Get down there, Chief.

928
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:05,056
The ball's in play. Ball's in play.

929
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:07,392
- That's bullshit.
- Ball's in play.

930
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:10,478
Oh, fuck that shit.
You got to be crazy.

931
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:13,356
Man, that doesn't go. The ball ain't in play.

932
01:09:13,774 --> 01:09:16,359
- Chief.
- Go on, Chief.

933
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:17,652
Put it in.

934
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:23,575
Chief, all right! That was great!

935
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,746
What a ball club.

936
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:59,903
McMurphy, get off the side.

937
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:02,447
- Come on, move it, man.
- Hey, damn it.

938
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:06,451
Go ahead. Come on. Come on.
There's no one looking.

939
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:09,037
Go ahead. Go ahead.

940
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:12,040
Go ahead.

941
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:16,502
I'll be seeing you on the outside.
You know what I mean?

942
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:18,963
By the time you get out of here...

943
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:21,049
...you'll be too old to even get it up.

944
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:25,094
Sixty-eight days, buddy.
Sixty-eight days.

945
01:10:25,262 --> 01:10:28,056
What the fuck you talking about,
68 days?

946
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,808
That's in jail, sucker.

947
01:10:30,976 --> 01:10:33,895
You still don't know where you're at,
do you?

948
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:38,483
- Yeah, where am I at, Washington?
- With us, baby, you're with us.

949
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:43,112
And you're gonna stay with us
until we let you go.

950
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:54,290
Do you want to say something
to the group, Mr. McMurphy?

951
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:58,586
Well, ahem, yeah.

952
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:04,050
I'd like to know why none of the guys
never told me that you...

953
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:05,802
...Miss Ratched...

954
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:10,974
...and the doctors could keep me here
till you're good and ready to turn me loose.

955
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:16,980
- That's what I'd like to know.
- Well, fine, Randall. That's a good start.

956
01:11:17,147 --> 01:11:20,608
Would anyone care
to answer Mr. McMurphy?

957
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:23,444
Answer what?

958
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:25,613
You heard me, Harding.

959
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:28,533
You let me go on hassling
Nurse Ratched here...

960
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:32,453
...knowing how much I had to lose
and you never told me nothing.

961
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:34,455
Now, Mac, wait a minute.

962
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:37,166
Wait a minute, I didn't know
anything about how much...

963
01:11:37,334 --> 01:11:39,961
- Shit. Fuck.
- Wait a minute. No, listen.

964
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:44,757
Now, look. I'm voluntary here, see?
I'm not committed.

965
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:50,054
I don't have to stay here.
I mean, I can go home any time I want.

966
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:53,057
You can go home any time you want?

967
01:11:53,225 --> 01:11:55,685
- That's it.
- You're bullshitting me.

968
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:57,895
He's bullshitting me, right?

969
01:11:58,063 --> 01:12:01,899
No, Randall,
he's telling you the truth.

970
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:06,154
As a matter of fact, there are
very few men here who are committed.

971
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:10,241
There's Mr. Bromden, Mr. Taber...

972
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:13,953
...some of the chronics, and you.

973
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:21,627
Cheswick?

974
01:12:21,795 --> 01:12:24,255
You're voluntary?

975
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,553
Scanlon?

976
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:37,268
Billy, for chrissakes,
you must be committed, right?

977
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:39,437
No... No... No.

978
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:43,358
Oh. Oh, man.

979
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:44,859
You're just a young kid.

980
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,987
What are you doing here?
You ought to be out in a convertible...

981
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:49,781
...bird-dogging chicks
and banging beaver.

982
01:12:49,948 --> 01:12:51,407
What are you doing here,
for chrissake?

983
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:55,620
- What's so funny about that?
- Well....

984
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:59,707
Jesus, I mean, you guys do nothing
but complain about how you can't...

985
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:03,544
...stand it in this place here, and then
you haven't got the guts to walk out?

986
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:07,632
I mean, what do you think you are,
for chrissake? Crazy or something?

987
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:11,302
Well, you're not. You're not.

988
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:14,889
You're no crazier than the average asshole
walking around on the streets.

989
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:20,770
And that's it.
Jesus Christ, I can't even believe it.

990
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:29,487
Those are very challenging observations
you made, Randall.

991
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:33,658
I'm sure some of the men
would like to comment.

992
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:38,746
Mr. Scanlon?

993
01:13:39,998 --> 01:13:44,669
I wanna know why the dorm is locked
in the daytime and on weekends.

994
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:54,595
Yeah. I would like to know
about our cigarettes.

995
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:58,683
May I have my cigarettes,
please, Miss Ratched?

996
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:01,811
You sit down, Mr. Cheswick,
and wait your turn.

997
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:06,524
Go ahead, sit down.

998
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:18,202
To answer your question
about the dorm, Mr. Scanlon...

999
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:19,537
...you know very well...

1000
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:24,041
...that if we left the door open, you'd just
go right back to bed after breakfast.

1001
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:27,295
- Am I right?
- So what?

1002
01:14:28,672 --> 01:14:30,965
May I have my cigarettes,
please, Miss Ratched?

1003
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:32,717
Forget the cigarettes, Cheswick.

1004
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:35,428
Cigarettes are not important.
Sit down, will you?

1005
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:37,388
For chrissake.

1006
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:43,019
Cigarettes.

1007
01:14:45,105 --> 01:14:48,191
Remember, Mr. Scanlon,
we've discussed many times...

1008
01:14:48,358 --> 01:14:52,737
...that time spent in the company of others
is very therapeutic...

1009
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:57,408
...while time spent brooding alone
only increases a feeling of separation.

1010
01:14:57,576 --> 01:14:58,993
You remember that, don't you?

1011
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:01,537
Do you mean to say...

1012
01:15:01,705 --> 01:15:03,664
...it's sick to wanna be
off by yourself?

1013
01:15:04,416 --> 01:15:05,583
Miss Ratched?

1014
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:10,254
Mr. Cheswick, you sit down.

1015
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:12,715
- But I wanna know about...
- Sit down, Mr. Cheswick.

1016
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:15,051
I wanna...

1017
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:18,513
- Give him a cigarette, will you, Harding?
- It's my last one.

1018
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:22,892
That's a fucking lie.
Why don't you give him a cigarette?

1019
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,228
Look, I'm not running a charity ward, see?

1020
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:26,896
Come on.

1021
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:31,734
Look, I don't want his cigarettes,
and I don't want his or his or his...

1022
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:37,240
...or his or his or his
or his or his, or even yours.

1023
01:15:37,407 --> 01:15:42,203
Do you understand that?
I want my cigarettes, Miss Ratched.

1024
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:46,916
I want my cigarettes.
I want mine, Miss Ratched.

1025
01:15:47,084 --> 01:15:49,210
What gives you the damn right...

1026
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:52,713
...to keep our cigarettes
piled up on your desk...

1027
01:15:53,006 --> 01:15:56,884
...and to squeeze out a pack
only when you feel like it, huh?

1028
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:01,472
- Miss Ratched.
- Mr.... Mr. Harding.

1029
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:05,476
Oh, I'm sorry.

1030
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:08,271
- You surprise me.
- No, well, I lost my head. I'm sorry.

1031
01:16:08,438 --> 01:16:12,483
I'm sorry, I didn't mean...
I'm really very sorry. I just forgot.

1032
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:15,653
I didn't mean...
I'm really very sorry. Just forgot.

1033
01:16:16,029 --> 01:16:17,446
- It's all right.
- Thank you.

1034
01:16:17,614 --> 01:16:19,782
Miss Ratched!

1035
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:24,245
- Yes, Mr. Cheswick?
- I asked you a question.

1036
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:27,373
I heard your question, Mr. Cheswick...

1037
01:16:27,541 --> 01:16:31,294
...and I will answer your question
as soon as you've calmed down.

1038
01:16:31,461 --> 01:16:33,296
Okay.

1039
01:16:35,716 --> 01:16:38,175
Are you calm, Mr. Cheswick?

1040
01:16:38,343 --> 01:16:40,636
- I'm calm.
- Good.

1041
01:16:41,972 --> 01:16:44,181
Now, as you all know...

1042
01:16:44,349 --> 01:16:48,519
...Mr. McMurphy has been running
a small gambling casino in our tub room.

1043
01:16:49,896 --> 01:16:52,773
Now, most of you lost all your
cigarettes to Mr. McMurphy...

1044
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:58,237
...not to mention a tidy sum
of money to Mr. McMurphy.

1045
01:16:58,405 --> 01:16:59,864
And that's why...

1046
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:03,367
...your tub-room privileges
have been suspended...

1047
01:17:03,535 --> 01:17:07,371
...and your cigarettes have been rationed.

1048
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:11,667
Mr. Martini?

1049
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:14,837
How we gonna win our money back?

1050
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:23,220
You're not going to win
your money back, Mr. Martini.

1051
01:17:23,388 --> 01:17:25,264
That's all over.

1052
01:17:25,432 --> 01:17:27,725
If you had obeyed the rules
in the first place...

1053
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:29,852
- ...you wouldn't have lost your money.
- Oh!

1054
01:17:39,112 --> 01:17:41,739
Sit down, gentlemen.
Sit down, gentlemen.

1055
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:43,949
- Sit down. Sit down.
- Oh! Oh!

1056
01:17:44,117 --> 01:17:48,913
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

1057
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:53,084
Rules? Piss on your fucking rules,
Miss Ratched.

1058
01:17:53,251 --> 01:17:54,710
Sit down, will you, Cheswick?

1059
01:17:54,878 --> 01:17:57,505
I want you to know something
here and now, Miss Ratched.

1060
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:01,008
- I ain't no little kid. I ain't no little kid...
- You sit down.

1061
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:04,303
...where you're gonna have cigarettes
kept from me like cookies...

1062
01:18:04,471 --> 01:18:06,972
...and I want something done!
Ain't that right, Mac?

1063
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:13,521
- That's right. Now, will you sit down?
- I won't! I won't! I want something done!

1064
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,523
- Sit down.
- I want something done!

1065
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:17,733
- I want something done!
- Mr. Washington!

1066
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:19,151
I want something done!

1067
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:22,405
I want something done!

1068
01:18:22,572 --> 01:18:25,700
I want something done!
I want something done!

1069
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:27,952
- Here. Here.
- I want something done!

1070
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:31,539
Goddamn it,
Cheswick, here. Hey, calm down.

1071
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:35,501
Why don't you leave him alone,
Washington? He's gonna be all right.

1072
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:49,306
Emergency 34-B, 34-B.

1073
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:53,728
I'm gonna break your fucking back.

1074
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:56,772
Punk-ass motherfucker.

1075
01:18:59,651 --> 01:19:02,987
Forget it.
It's all over, McMurphy.

1076
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:06,449
Warren! Warren!

1077
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:10,619
Warren.

1078
01:19:46,364 --> 01:19:48,532
Would you move, please?
We need this chair.

1079
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:51,535
Just move right over there, okay.

1080
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:58,292
I see we have Mr. Bromden back.
Yeah, okay.

1081
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:00,044
Don't bother anyone.

1082
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:01,962
- Mr. McMurphy.
- Mr. McMurphy.

1083
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:05,216
- How do you do, Mr. McMurphy?
- I do real fine.

1084
01:20:05,383 --> 01:20:07,718
I know you didn't do anything wrong.
Just sit down.

1085
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:11,013
We're not going to hurt you.
Sit down, right here. That's it.

1086
01:20:11,181 --> 01:20:13,599
Nurse, this is Mr. Cheswick.
He's a little upset.

1087
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:15,935
Okay, fine. Thank you very much.

1088
01:20:16,102 --> 01:20:18,312
- You'll be okay, Mr. Cheswick.
- Yes.

1089
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,857
Would you keep an eye on these three?

1090
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:14,285
Would you please take these,
gentlemen?

1091
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,954
He can't hear nothing.

1092
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:21,292
That's it.

1093
01:21:25,088 --> 01:21:26,255
Calm down, Ches, will you?

1094
01:21:26,673 --> 01:21:29,717
Mr. Cheswick, would you please follow me?

1095
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:33,554
Mr. Cheswick?

1096
01:21:37,225 --> 01:21:39,435
Mac. Mac.

1097
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:41,395
- No!
- Nobody's gonna hurt you.

1098
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:43,856
- No!
- It'll be all right, Ches.

1099
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:46,233
- No!
- You're all right. No one's gonna hurt you.

1100
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:47,443
No, leave me alone.

1101
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:52,239
- Make it easy on yourself.
- No. Mac. Mac.

1102
01:21:53,783 --> 01:21:56,660
Come on. Come on, now. Come on.

1103
01:21:56,828 --> 01:22:00,831
- Come on.
- No. I didn't do nothing.

1104
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:03,500
Mac. No!

1105
01:22:03,668 --> 01:22:10,090
- Come on.
- I won't go. I don't wanna go. I won't go.

1106
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:19,183
Jesus Christ.

1107
01:22:22,854 --> 01:22:24,855
All right, then.

1108
01:22:28,985 --> 01:22:31,070
Want some gum?

1109
01:22:34,824 --> 01:22:35,866
Thank you.

1110
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:01,225
Ah, Juicy Fruit.

1111
01:23:02,727 --> 01:23:07,523
Well, you sly son of a bitch, Chief.
Ha!

1112
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:14,279
- Can you hear me too?
- Yeah, you bet.

1113
01:23:14,447 --> 01:23:18,242
Well, I'll be goddamned, Chief.

1114
01:23:19,744 --> 01:23:24,206
And they all... They all think
you're deaf and dumb.

1115
01:23:24,916 --> 01:23:26,959
Jesus Christ.

1116
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:31,088
You fooled them, Chief.

1117
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:35,092
You fooled them. You fooled them all.
Goddamn.

1118
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:42,850
What are we doing in here, Chief? Huh?

1119
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:46,103
What's us two guys doing
in this fucking place?

1120
01:23:54,112 --> 01:23:56,363
Let's get out of here.

1121
01:23:57,490 --> 01:23:59,283
Out.

1122
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:07,624
- Canada?
- Canada.

1123
01:24:07,792 --> 01:24:12,379
We'll be there before these son
of a bitches know what hit them.

1124
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:16,300
Listen to Randall on this one.

1125
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:39,073
- Mr. McMurphy?
- Huh?

1126
01:24:39,657 --> 01:24:41,700
Please follow me.

1127
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:48,332
You and me, Chief.

1128
01:24:59,969 --> 01:25:02,638
Take a cigarette break, boys. Easy.

1129
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:10,646
I'll be fine, thank you. Seated.

1130
01:25:15,193 --> 01:25:17,236
- Would you sit up, please?
- Sure. Love to.

1131
01:25:17,403 --> 01:25:18,570
Attaboy.

1132
01:25:18,738 --> 01:25:22,533
There might be a little fluid in them
boots, you know what I mean, boys?

1133
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,618
Just a little leak.

1134
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:26,537
A light shine, boys...

1135
01:25:26,746 --> 01:25:29,998
...and send the specimen to Nurse Ratched.

1136
01:25:38,091 --> 01:25:39,883
- All right, out with your gum.
- Hmm?

1137
01:25:40,051 --> 01:25:41,885
Out with your gum.

1138
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:48,392
Okay, this won't hurt, and
it'll be over in just a moment.

1139
01:25:49,727 --> 01:25:51,562
- What's that?
- Conductant.

1140
01:25:51,729 --> 01:25:53,355
A little dab will do you.

1141
01:25:53,523 --> 01:25:55,566
Ain't that right, Mr. Jackson?

1142
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:58,735
Open your mouth.

1143
01:25:59,028 --> 01:26:01,572
- What's that?
- Keep you from biting your tongue.

1144
01:26:01,739 --> 01:26:03,991
Now just bite down on it.

1145
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:07,411
That's right. Just bite down.
Now, bite down on it.

1146
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:15,711
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

1147
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:20,424
Here we go.

1148
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:53,957
Now, one big breath.

1149
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:00,589
Very good.

1150
01:27:03,176 --> 01:27:06,386
Gentlemen, I'd like to begin today.
It shouldn't take too long.

1151
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:12,100
Jim, it's been brought to my attention...

1152
01:27:12,268 --> 01:27:15,979
...that you've been giving
Mr. Fredrickson your medication.

1153
01:27:16,147 --> 01:27:17,481
Is that true?

1154
01:27:23,112 --> 01:27:24,988
No, ma'am.

1155
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:27,824
Jim...

1156
01:27:27,992 --> 01:27:30,869
...are you giving your medication
to Mr. Fredrickson...

1157
01:27:31,037 --> 01:27:33,163
...or are you not?

1158
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:10,534
How about it, you creeps, you
lunatics, mental defectives.

1159
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:15,372
Let's hear it for Bullgoose Randall,
back in action. Nice shirt, Cheseroo.

1160
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:22,713
Look at the faces on you.
Look at you.

1161
01:28:23,089 --> 01:28:25,465
The feebs' brigade, you ding-a-lings.

1162
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:29,428
The mental defective league in formation.

1163
01:28:30,888 --> 01:28:34,224
How are you, Nurse Ratched?
I'm happy to be back.

1164
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:38,729
- We're happy to have you back, Randall.
- Thank you.

1165
01:28:39,063 --> 01:28:42,399
Would you like to rest today, or
would you like to join the group?

1166
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:46,236
I'd love to join the group.

1167
01:28:46,404 --> 01:28:47,696
I'd like....

1168
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:50,866
I'm proud to join the group, Mildred.
Ahem.

1169
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:55,912
- How...
- Perfect, Billy boy. Absolutely perfect.

1170
01:28:56,080 --> 01:29:00,792
They was giving me 10,000 watts a day,
you know, and I'm hot to trot.

1171
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:03,879
Next woman takes me on is gonna
light up like a pinball machine...

1172
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:05,422
...and pay off in silver dollars.

1173
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:12,262
Well, that's an amusing thought, Randall...

1174
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:15,307
...but when you came in,
we were talking to Jim.

1175
01:29:15,475 --> 01:29:20,062
He has a problem with his medication,
and we'd like to get back to that.

1176
01:29:20,229 --> 01:29:22,647
Oh, I don't mind at all, Nurse Ratched.

1177
01:29:22,815 --> 01:29:27,069
I'm, uh, gentle as a puppy dog and....

1178
01:29:27,236 --> 01:29:29,988
Please proceed. Thank you.

1179
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:33,617
The administration
<i>was hopeful but cautious Friday...</i>

1180
01:29:34,494 --> 01:29:36,953
<i>...in its reaction</i>
<i>to a possible opening of the Berlin Wall...</i>

1181
01:29:37,121 --> 01:29:40,374
<i>...during the upcoming Christmas holiday.</i>

1182
01:29:40,958 --> 01:29:44,252
Good night, gentlemen.
See you in the morning.

1183
01:30:15,993 --> 01:30:20,705
<i>Authorities in Birmingham,</i>
<i>Alabama have arrested three men...</i>

1184
01:30:20,873 --> 01:30:23,375
<i>...in connection with a church</i>
<i>bombing in the city...</i>

1185
01:30:23,543 --> 01:30:28,255
<i>...which killed three Negro children</i>
<i>while they were attending services.</i>

1186
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:33,760
<i>The three men, R.E. Chambliss,</i>
<i>Charles Cagle and John Hall...</i>

1187
01:30:33,928 --> 01:30:38,098

1189

<i>...pending full investigation....</i>

1191
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:11,756
Yeah, baby, it's Mac.

1192
01:31:11,924 --> 01:31:13,341
It's on tonight.

1193
01:31:13,509 --> 01:31:14,926
Don't worry about it.

1194
01:31:15,094 --> 01:31:17,929
Don't worry about it. Get a car.

1195
01:31:18,097 --> 01:31:21,391
I don't give a shit, baby.
Steal it if you have to.

1196
01:31:21,976 --> 01:31:23,560
I gotta go. I gotta go.

1197
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:26,730
Uh, don't forget
to bring some booze. Right.

1198
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:28,565
Bye.

1199
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:21,451
Chief.

1200
01:32:21,619 --> 01:32:24,871
Chief, I can't take it no more.

1201
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:26,957
I gotta get out of here.

1202
01:32:31,921 --> 01:32:34,714
I can't. I just can't.

1203
01:32:35,925 --> 01:32:37,884
It's easier than you think, Chief.

1204
01:32:39,637 --> 01:32:43,306
For you, maybe.
You're a lot bigger than me.

1205
01:32:45,142 --> 01:32:48,645
Why, Chief, you're about as big
as a goddamn tree trunk.

1206
01:32:54,527 --> 01:32:57,487
My papa's real big.

1207
01:32:57,947 --> 01:33:00,657
He did like he pleased.

1208
01:33:00,825 --> 01:33:03,952
That's why everybody worked on him.

1209
01:33:06,163 --> 01:33:11,334
The last time I seen my father
he was blind in the cedars from drinking.

1210
01:33:11,502 --> 01:33:14,337
And every time he put
the bottle to his mouth...

1211
01:33:14,505 --> 01:33:16,548
...he don't suck out of it.

1212
01:33:16,716 --> 01:33:20,385
It sucks out of him until he'd shrunk...

1213
01:33:20,553 --> 01:33:24,347
...so wrinkled and yellow,
even the dogs don't know him.

1214
01:33:25,182 --> 01:33:26,600
Killed him, huh?

1215
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:31,563
I'm not saying they killed him.

1216
01:33:31,731 --> 01:33:36,610
They just worked on him,
the way they're working on you.

1217
01:33:44,577 --> 01:33:48,371
There they are, Chief.
There they are. They're here.

1218
01:34:01,677 --> 01:34:05,221
Hey. Hey. Over here. That's it.

1219
01:34:05,806 --> 01:34:07,807
McMurphy,
stop all this holy-roller shit...

1220
01:34:07,975 --> 01:34:10,226
...and get your ass back in bed.
You understand?

1221
01:34:10,853 --> 01:34:15,857
Well, uh, my prayers
have been answered, Turkle.

1222
01:34:16,025 --> 01:34:18,443
Come on and see.

1223
01:34:26,243 --> 01:34:28,662
You'd take, uh, $20...

1224
01:34:28,829 --> 01:34:32,624
...to get down on your knees
and pray, wouldn't you, Turkle?

1225
01:34:33,125 --> 01:34:35,001
No, it don't send me, don't send me.

1226
01:34:35,169 --> 01:34:36,920
- It don't?
- Don't do nothing to me, no.

1227
01:34:37,088 --> 01:34:39,422
Well, you know there'll be more.

1228
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:44,678
I mean, uh, they'll be bringing
a couple of bottles with them, and, uh....

1229
01:34:45,012 --> 01:34:47,931
You're getting closer, brother.
You're getting closer...

1230
01:34:49,433 --> 01:34:53,436
...but they gonna be sharing
more than just bottles, ain't they?

1231
01:34:53,604 --> 01:34:55,605
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

1232
01:34:55,773 --> 01:34:57,691
- I know what you mean.
- You understand?

1233
01:34:57,858 --> 01:35:00,527
Yeah, I understand what you mean.

1234
01:35:00,695 --> 01:35:03,113
- Anything you say, Turkle.
- I'm on my knees, brother.

1235
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:06,116
- Yeah, all right, all right.
- I'm on my knees.

1236
01:35:06,283 --> 01:35:07,450
- All right.
- Let them in.

1237
01:35:10,538 --> 01:35:13,289
- Let me give you a hand here.
- I appreciate that.

1238
01:35:13,457 --> 01:35:14,916
- Hi.
- Ladies.

1239
01:35:15,084 --> 01:35:18,294
Oh, thank you. I believe this
is your department, Mr. Turkle.

1240
01:35:18,462 --> 01:35:20,547
- Hi, how you doing?
- Hi, Rose, how you doing?

1241
01:35:20,715 --> 01:35:23,049
- Love to give her a hand.
- Ow!

1242
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:25,552
- Keep it down.
- Shh.

1243
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:28,263
- I split my pants.
- Keep it down.

1244
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:32,183
- Give it to me. Give it all to me.
- You got to keep it down.

1245
01:35:32,351 --> 01:35:33,643
Hi.

1246
01:35:34,437 --> 01:35:35,937
This looks like my high school.

1247
01:35:38,566 --> 01:35:40,567
Oh, hey, I take that.

1248
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:42,444
- The barber chair.
- You may have it.

1249
01:35:42,611 --> 01:35:43,987
It is mine, mine.

1250
01:35:44,155 --> 01:35:46,114
You can have it.
You can have it, honey.

1251
01:35:48,617 --> 01:35:52,328
- Take a load of these tubs.
- Real nice place you got here, Mac.

1252
01:35:53,831 --> 01:35:58,001
- Hey, can I take a bath?
- Sure, you can take a bath. Sure.

1253
01:35:58,169 --> 01:36:00,628
Just don't drown
your pretty little self.

1254
01:36:00,796 --> 01:36:02,088
You know, um...

1255
01:36:02,256 --> 01:36:06,176
...Rose was married to a maniac once,
up in Beaverton.

1256
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:10,263
Oh, really, miss?
What seemed to be the problem?

1257
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:14,976
Oh, nothing, he used to put
frogs in my bra all the time.

1258
01:36:17,354 --> 01:36:20,315
Very interesting.

1259
01:36:20,483 --> 01:36:22,609
Mr. Turkle.

1260
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:27,197
Uh, Rose is very interested
in hospitals and hospital facilities.

1261
01:36:27,364 --> 01:36:29,741
- I am?
- Yes. Oh, yes, you are.

1262
01:36:29,909 --> 01:36:32,035
- I'm going to take Candy...
- Where you going?

1263
01:36:32,203 --> 01:36:34,662
Uh, I'm gonna take Candy for a stroll.

1264
01:36:34,830 --> 01:36:36,372
I got you, I got you.

1265
01:36:36,540 --> 01:36:39,334
- But just don't make too much noise.
- Not a peep, not a peep.

1266
01:36:39,502 --> 01:36:40,710
Peep.

1267
01:36:40,878 --> 01:36:43,046
- All right.
- Yes, that's right.

1268
01:36:43,214 --> 01:36:47,050
Now, you come over here, baby,
right over here.

1269
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:51,054
- Candy?
- Don't worry about Candy, honey.

1270
01:36:51,222 --> 01:36:53,223
Sit down and relax. Now....

1271
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:08,738
Wake up, boys. Wake up.

1272
01:37:08,906 --> 01:37:11,825
It's medication time.

1273
01:37:11,992 --> 01:37:14,327
Medication time.

1274
01:37:14,495 --> 01:37:16,538
The nighttime spirits are here.

1275
01:37:16,705 --> 01:37:18,915
It's Randall to say goodbye...

1276
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:24,420
...and get you high, and
nighttime angel, Candy. Oh, yes.

1277
01:37:24,588 --> 01:37:28,258
That's right, Mr. Martini,
there is an Easter bunny.

1278
01:37:37,768 --> 01:37:42,272
Round the side, boys. Join Mr. McMurphy
in the executive lounge, please.

1279
01:37:42,439 --> 01:37:43,439
Round the side.

1280
01:37:47,987 --> 01:37:50,363
It's gonna be so great.

1281
01:37:50,656 --> 01:37:54,033
You like a nip, don't you, Charles?
No trouble at all.

1282
01:37:54,201 --> 01:37:58,162
It's Billy the Club of the
fabulous and fantastic 14...

1283
01:37:58,330 --> 01:38:01,457
- What the hell's going on?
- Mr. Turkle.

1284
01:38:04,003 --> 01:38:05,753
Ain't this a bitch.

1285
01:38:05,921 --> 01:38:09,007
McMurphy, what you trying to do?
Get my ass really fired, man?

1286
01:38:09,174 --> 01:38:11,843
Come on, get your ass out of here.
Ain't this a... Come on.

1287
01:38:12,011 --> 01:38:13,219
We're just having a party.

1288
01:38:13,387 --> 01:38:16,097
Party, my ass. This ain't no
nightclub, this is a hospital.

1289
01:38:16,473 --> 01:38:20,727
Man, this is my fucking job.
I don't give a damn, this is my fucking job.

1290
01:38:23,147 --> 01:38:26,482
Oh, shit. The supervisor.
Come on, get your asses back in there.

1291
01:38:26,650 --> 01:38:29,152
Come on. Come on there.

1292
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:33,656
Where is that no-talking son of a bitch?
Is he in there? Good. Come on.

1293
01:38:58,474 --> 01:39:00,474
Mr. Turkle?

1294
01:39:07,524 --> 01:39:10,693
Where the hell is he?
Why doesn't he answer?

1295
01:39:11,278 --> 01:39:12,528
He's jerking off somewhere.

1296
01:39:13,864 --> 01:39:15,865
Ain't nobody jerking off
nowhere, motherfucker.

1297
01:39:16,033 --> 01:39:17,909
Turkle, what the
fuck are you doing here?

1298
01:39:18,077 --> 01:39:19,369
Go out there and talk to her.

1299
01:39:19,536 --> 01:39:22,664
Doing the same fucking thing
you're doing in here, hiding.

1300
01:39:26,126 --> 01:39:27,210
Yes, ma'am?

1301
01:39:28,796 --> 01:39:32,715
- Everything all right, Mr. Turkle?
- Oh, everything is just fine, ma'am.

1302
01:39:32,883 --> 01:39:34,342
Just fine. Just fine.

1303
01:39:44,061 --> 01:39:45,687
Who's there?

1304
01:39:46,438 --> 01:39:49,857
- Ain't nobody in there.
- Please open that door.

1305
01:39:57,074 --> 01:39:58,741
I'm sorry.

1306
01:39:58,909 --> 01:40:00,326
Heh.

1307
01:40:02,538 --> 01:40:08,042
I'm sorry, ma'am, but you know,
a man gets awful lonesome at night.

1308
01:40:08,210 --> 01:40:13,089
You understand what I mean, don't you?
You understand? I'm sure you understand.

1309
01:40:13,257 --> 01:40:17,677
I want that woman off
this ward immediately.

1310
01:40:18,429 --> 01:40:22,098
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

1311
01:40:41,744 --> 01:40:43,786
- Jesus.
- Mr. Turkle, is she gone?

1312
01:40:43,954 --> 01:40:45,705
Shit, yeah, she's gone, and so am I.

1313
01:40:45,873 --> 01:40:47,957
Get your behinds out of here
and back to bed.

1314
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:50,168
Go ahead, move it, move it. Move it.

1315
01:40:50,335 --> 01:40:52,086
- I knew we were in trouble.
- Let's go.

1316
01:40:52,254 --> 01:40:55,298
You and your teddy-bear ass.
Move them on out of here.

1317
01:40:55,466 --> 01:40:56,924
Come on, come on.

1318
01:40:57,092 --> 01:40:58,760
- Candy?
- Come on, Candy.

1319
01:40:58,927 --> 01:41:00,928
Jesus Christ.

1320
01:41:01,096 --> 01:41:02,764
Mr. Turkle, I'm really sorry.

1321
01:41:02,931 --> 01:41:05,433
Motherfuckers fucking with my job.

1322
01:41:05,601 --> 01:41:07,518
- Get out.
- I'm really sorry.

1323
01:41:07,686 --> 01:41:08,811
What are you...?

1324
01:41:08,979 --> 01:41:10,730
What the fuck...?
Get out of here.

1325
01:41:10,898 --> 01:41:14,400
Please get out, this is my job.
You fucking it up. You understand?

1326
01:41:14,568 --> 01:41:16,235
Get out.

1327
01:41:16,403 --> 01:41:18,654
Get out of here,
you slim motherfucker.

1328
01:41:20,449 --> 01:41:24,202
Fuck it.

1329
01:41:35,506 --> 01:41:40,301
Good night, good night,
don't let the cooties bite.

1330
01:41:54,274 --> 01:41:55,316
There.

1331
01:41:55,484 --> 01:41:59,320
Make you get up and dance. Okay?

1332
01:42:06,912 --> 01:42:09,330
Right out of the Shock Department.
I got it from...

1333
01:42:09,498 --> 01:42:11,040
I got it from Ratched's charts.

1334
01:42:11,208 --> 01:42:15,378
Right. There you go, there you go.
Easy now. Don't take it all at once.

1335
01:42:15,546 --> 01:42:18,339
Let's try a little over here.
There you go.

1336
01:44:03,570 --> 01:44:05,488
Let's go.

1337
01:44:10,786 --> 01:44:13,788
I'll have to be the one, Chief.

1338
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:32,181
Hey, Mac, what's going on? Huh?

1339
01:44:32,349 --> 01:44:36,852
Well, Dale, Lord
Randall is stepping down one.

1340
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:39,188
Fredrickson.

1341
01:44:40,357 --> 01:44:41,941
Jimmy.

1342
01:44:42,109 --> 01:44:44,110
You gonna say goodbye to me, Mac?

1343
01:44:44,278 --> 01:44:47,405
Sure, I'm gonna say
goodbye to you, Charles.

1344
01:44:47,572 --> 01:44:49,991
- Hey, Mac? Mac?
- Yeah?

1345
01:44:50,158 --> 01:44:53,494
Thank you, Mac. Thank you.

1346
01:44:53,662 --> 01:44:57,999
- I'll never forget you.
- Settle down, Charles, all right?

1347
01:45:00,335 --> 01:45:02,670
Hey, Billy, what's wrong?

1348
01:45:04,006 --> 01:45:06,382
Billy, for chrissake....

1349
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:11,679
What's the matter?

1350
01:45:14,558 --> 01:45:18,227
I'm... I'm gonna...
Gonna miss you very, very...

1351
01:45:18,395 --> 01:45:21,230
...very, very much, Mac.

1352
01:45:23,483 --> 01:45:26,360
Well, why don't you
come with us, then?

1353
01:45:27,529 --> 01:45:30,448
Think... Think I don't want to?

1354
01:45:30,615 --> 01:45:36,454
- So come on, then, let's go.
- Well... Well, it's not... Not that easy.

1355
01:45:38,957 --> 01:45:42,918
I'm not... Not...
Not ready yet.

1356
01:45:44,921 --> 01:45:46,255
Tell you what we'll do.

1357
01:45:46,423 --> 01:45:48,674
When I get to Canada,
I'll write you a postcard...

1358
01:45:48,842 --> 01:45:51,427
...and I'll put my address on it.

1359
01:45:51,595 --> 01:45:55,014
That way when you are ready,
you'll know where to go.

1360
01:45:55,182 --> 01:45:57,350
What do you say?

1361
01:45:59,644 --> 01:46:01,354
Yeah.

1362
01:46:02,230 --> 01:46:08,944
Ma... ? Mac? Is she...?
She going with you?

1363
01:46:12,824 --> 01:46:13,949
Candy?

1364
01:46:16,536 --> 01:46:20,748
Yeah, she'll be there when you get there.
She's going with us.

1365
01:46:20,916 --> 01:46:25,294
Are you gonna...?
Gonna marry her?

1366
01:46:25,462 --> 01:46:30,049
No. No, we're just good friends. Why?

1367
01:46:37,516 --> 01:46:39,058
No... No... Nothing.

1368
01:46:39,226 --> 01:46:44,313
No... No... Don't "nothing" me,
all right? What is it?

1369
01:46:49,611 --> 01:46:55,783
Well, it's too... Too late.

1370
01:46:58,912 --> 01:47:01,247
You want a date with her?

1371
01:47:01,415 --> 01:47:02,540
No.

1372
01:47:02,707 --> 01:47:08,337
Jesus, I must be crazy to
be in a loony bin like this.

1373
01:47:08,505 --> 01:47:10,047
Date, huh?

1374
01:47:10,215 --> 01:47:13,217
Well, it'll have to be a fast
date, I'll tell you that.

1375
01:47:13,385 --> 01:47:18,431
No... No... Not now.

1376
01:47:18,598 --> 01:47:19,807
Not now?

1377
01:47:20,392 --> 01:47:21,434
When, then?

1378
01:47:29,526 --> 01:47:31,527
When I have a free weekend.

1379
01:47:32,237 --> 01:47:36,240
You busy right now, are you?
You got something to do right now?

1380
01:47:36,408 --> 01:47:37,950
- You got something to do?
- Uh, no... No.

1381
01:47:38,118 --> 01:47:41,036
Good, then don't talk to me about
when you're ready. Yeah, yeah.

1382
01:47:41,204 --> 01:47:42,955
- No. No.
- Ready and everything like that.

1383
01:47:43,123 --> 01:47:45,124
Candy, come here a minute.

1384
01:47:45,292 --> 01:47:48,794
Yes, yes, yes. Candy,
I want you to meet the famous Billy.

1385
01:47:48,962 --> 01:47:50,880
Go get him, will you?

1386
01:47:51,047 --> 01:47:53,549
Go get him. Get him out of there.

1387
01:47:53,717 --> 01:47:58,304
I want you to get ahold of Billy....

1388
01:47:58,472 --> 01:48:00,514
All you gotta do is this one little thing.

1389
01:48:00,682 --> 01:48:03,726
- The kid's cute, isn't he? Huh?
- Yeah.

1390
01:48:08,565 --> 01:48:11,233
Think of me the whole time.

1391
01:48:11,735 --> 01:48:15,946
There he is. Billy the Club.

1392
01:48:20,660 --> 01:48:24,121
Billy, I got $25...

1393
01:48:24,289 --> 01:48:28,000
...that says you are gonna burn
this woman down.

1394
01:48:29,586 --> 01:48:32,171
Oh, boy.

1395
01:48:34,174 --> 01:48:36,258
Candy, baby...

1396
01:48:39,846 --> 01:48:41,931
...I love you.

1397
01:48:42,098 --> 01:48:43,641
Hurl the ringer.

1398
01:48:47,938 --> 01:48:52,024
Hey, easy. Back. Back. Come on.

1399
01:48:52,192 --> 01:48:53,275
That's enough.

1400
01:48:53,443 --> 01:48:55,611
No, no, no, I'll show you some card tricks.

1401
01:48:55,779 --> 01:48:57,613
You ain't seen the Spanish deck yet.

1402
01:48:57,781 --> 01:48:59,949
That's 40 percent more torture.

1403
01:49:01,952 --> 01:49:04,286
Mr. Scanlon, I'm gonna present you...

1404
01:49:04,454 --> 01:49:09,124
...with this fine deck
of cards for playing.

1405
01:49:11,294 --> 01:49:15,130
This ain't gonna take long, Rose,
you know what I mean?

1406
01:49:24,808 --> 01:49:27,351
When we get to Canada....

1407
01:51:13,917 --> 01:51:17,503
Out of sight, man. Out of sight.

1408
01:51:33,603 --> 01:51:34,645
Morning, Miss Ratched.

1409
01:51:34,813 --> 01:51:36,897
- Morning.
- Good morning.

1410
01:51:40,860 --> 01:51:44,488
Mr. Warren, close the window
and lock the screen.

1411
01:51:44,656 --> 01:51:46,824
Right.

1412
01:52:11,307 --> 01:52:14,268
Mr. Miller, show this woman
the way out of the hospital.

1413
01:52:14,436 --> 01:52:16,311
Gladly.

1414
01:52:17,981 --> 01:52:19,106
- Come on, lady, let's go.
- Oh...

1415
01:52:19,274 --> 01:52:20,649
- You're going home.
- Where?

1416
01:52:20,817 --> 01:52:23,152
Let her go, Scanlon.
You're going home.

1417
01:52:23,319 --> 01:52:24,945
- Mr. Washington?
- Yes, Miss Ratched.

1418
01:52:25,113 --> 01:52:27,990
- Make sure no one is missing.
- Will do.

1419
01:52:29,325 --> 01:52:30,993
- Mac?
- Come on, Scanlon, move.

1420
01:52:31,161 --> 01:52:33,579
- Everybody out of here.
- Come on, move it out.

1421
01:52:33,747 --> 01:52:36,790
Come on, move it.
Martini, get your butt up. Come on, up.

1422
01:52:36,958 --> 01:52:38,834
Colonel, get your dead ass up there.

1423
01:52:39,002 --> 01:52:41,837
What the hell's going on here?
Come on, move out.

1424
01:52:49,095 --> 01:52:51,847
- Move it out of there.
- Miss Ratched?

1425
01:52:52,015 --> 01:52:55,184
Okay, Martini, let's go. Move it.

1426
01:52:55,351 --> 01:52:58,187
- Fredrickson, what you doing?
- Where you going? Back out here.

1427
01:52:58,354 --> 01:53:01,190
- Let's go. Go on, let's go.
- What the hell is that?

1428
01:53:02,275 --> 01:53:06,320
Taber, get up. Come on.
I said, get up.

1429
01:53:09,157 --> 01:53:13,869
Move it back there. McMurphy, get your
ass over here, and bring Dracula with you.

1430
01:53:14,037 --> 01:53:15,871
- Move it.
- Come on.

1431
01:53:16,164 --> 01:53:18,040
Let's go. Let's go.

1432
01:53:18,208 --> 01:53:20,250
Stay right there, Bancini.

1433
01:53:20,835 --> 01:53:22,419
- Miss Ratched?
- Yes?

1434
01:53:22,587 --> 01:53:24,755
Looks like Billy Bibbit's
the only one missing.

1435
01:53:24,923 --> 01:53:26,840
- Billy?
- Mm-hm.

1436
01:53:27,008 --> 01:53:29,927
- Thank you, Mr. Washington.
- Okay.

1437
01:53:30,804 --> 01:53:34,765
Did Billy Bibbit leave the grounds
of the hospital, gentlemen?

1438
01:53:39,020 --> 01:53:42,022
I want an answer to my question.

1439
01:53:42,357 --> 01:53:45,484
Did he leave the grounds
of the hospital?

1440
01:53:57,831 --> 01:53:59,289
- Mr. Washington?
- Yes.

1441
01:53:59,457 --> 01:54:02,584
Miss Pilbow, check all the rooms.

1442
01:54:02,752 --> 01:54:03,919
- Mr. Warren?
- Yes.

1443
01:54:04,087 --> 01:54:06,755
You'll start with the tub room.

1444
01:54:13,263 --> 01:54:14,429
Mr. Martini?

1445
01:54:15,682 --> 01:54:18,225
May I have my cap, please?

1446
01:54:18,518 --> 01:54:23,105
My cap. My cap. There.

1447
01:54:27,151 --> 01:54:28,402
Thank you.

1448
01:54:54,053 --> 01:54:56,138
Miss Ratched.

1449
01:55:31,382 --> 01:55:33,342
Miss Ratched....

1450
01:55:45,980 --> 01:55:48,649
Um, I can explain everything.

1451
01:55:48,816 --> 01:55:50,692
Please do, Billy.

1452
01:55:50,860 --> 01:55:53,487
Explain everything.

1453
01:55:56,324 --> 01:55:58,700
Everything?

1454
01:56:00,119 --> 01:56:02,996
Aren't you ashamed?

1455
01:56:04,832 --> 01:56:06,291
No, I'm not.

1456
01:56:06,459 --> 01:56:07,709
All right.

1457
01:56:16,761 --> 01:56:18,887
You know, Billy, what worries me...

1458
01:56:19,055 --> 01:56:22,224
...is how your mother's
going to take this.

1459
01:56:30,358 --> 01:56:32,401
Well, you...

1460
01:56:32,568 --> 01:56:36,238
You don't have to...

1461
01:56:36,406 --> 01:56:39,491
...tell her, Miss Ratched.

1462
01:56:39,909 --> 01:56:41,326
I don't have to tell her?

1463
01:56:43,246 --> 01:56:46,081
Your mother and I are old friends.
You know that.

1464
01:56:54,215 --> 01:57:01,138
Um.... Please do...
Don't tell my m...

1465
01:57:01,305 --> 01:57:04,599
Don't you think you should have thought
of that before you took that woman...

1466
01:57:04,767 --> 01:57:06,685
...in that room?

1467
01:57:14,944 --> 01:57:17,237
No, no.

1468
01:57:18,281 --> 01:57:19,448
I...

1469
01:57:22,285 --> 01:57:23,618
I didn't.

1470
01:57:23,786 --> 01:57:26,955
You mean she dragged you in there
by force?

1471
01:57:34,839 --> 01:57:38,133
She... She...

1472
01:57:40,470 --> 01:57:43,096
She... She did.

1473
01:57:46,267 --> 01:57:51,438
- Everybody did.
- Everybody? Who did?

1474
01:57:51,606 --> 01:57:53,607
You tell me who did.

1475
01:58:12,835 --> 01:58:15,796
M... McMurphy.

1476
01:58:18,341 --> 01:58:23,553
Miss Rat...
Miss Ratched, please don't...

1477
01:58:23,721 --> 01:58:26,306
- ...tell my mother, please.
- Mr. Warren?

1478
01:58:26,474 --> 01:58:29,226
Would you see that the men
are washed and ready for the day?

1479
01:58:29,393 --> 01:58:34,022
Miss Ratched, please...
Please don't tell my mother.

1480
01:58:34,190 --> 01:58:35,482
- Mr. Washington?
- Yes?

1481
01:58:35,650 --> 01:58:38,360
- Put Billy in Dr. Spivey's office.
- No, no. No.

1482
01:58:38,528 --> 01:58:41,446
- Stay with him till the doctor arrives.
- No, no, no.

1483
01:58:41,614 --> 01:58:44,199
No, no. No.

1484
01:58:46,244 --> 01:58:49,204
- Move it. Come on, Martini, get on.
- No.

1485
01:58:49,372 --> 01:58:51,372
No! No! No!

1486
01:59:11,894 --> 01:59:15,522
That way, please.
Please, gentlemen. Huh?

1487
01:59:15,690 --> 01:59:18,191
Let's go, come on.
Come on, you guys. What is this?

1488
01:59:18,359 --> 01:59:19,401
Let's go.

1489
01:59:43,634 --> 01:59:45,385
Hey, what the hell is that?

1490
01:59:45,845 --> 01:59:48,597
McMurphy, what the hell are you doing?

1491
01:59:53,227 --> 01:59:57,022
Washington to the Day Room. Immediately.

1492
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:09,743
Put down those keys and nobody gets hurt.

1493
02:00:19,587 --> 02:00:22,797
Move away from the window
and take that damn Chief with you.

1494
02:00:32,391 --> 02:00:33,934
Mac?

1495
02:00:34,644 --> 02:00:37,145
Come on, let's go.

1496
02:00:45,321 --> 02:00:48,823
Let me through. Let me through.

1497
02:00:59,502 --> 02:01:00,919
Out of the way, McMurphy.

1498
02:01:04,799 --> 02:01:08,009
- Come on, clear it.
- Get these people out of here.

1499
02:01:08,177 --> 02:01:10,553
- Oh, Billy.
- Will you guys clear the door?

1500
02:01:10,721 --> 02:01:13,348
Everybody out. Out. Everybody out.

1501
02:01:13,683 --> 02:01:16,351
Come on, goddamn it. Get your ass...

1502
02:01:18,729 --> 02:01:20,021
Now calm down.

1503
02:01:20,690 --> 02:01:23,900
The best thing we can do
is go on with our daily routine.

1504
02:01:24,068 --> 02:01:26,528
All right?

1505
02:01:26,696 --> 02:01:29,155
Mac. Don't.

1506
02:01:32,868 --> 02:01:34,286
Don't. Mac.

1507
02:01:38,082 --> 02:01:43,086
Mac. Don't. Mac. No.

1508
02:01:43,754 --> 02:01:44,796
Don't.

1509
02:02:19,582 --> 02:02:21,416
And the bets are placed.

1510
02:02:21,584 --> 02:02:24,711
There's one for Tabes and Chessy
and Martini and the dealer.

1511
02:02:24,879 --> 02:02:27,130
And a four to Tabes,
and a six and a nine...

1512
02:02:27,298 --> 02:02:30,842
- ...and a 10 to the dealer.
- A nine? Nine?

1513
02:02:31,010 --> 02:02:33,094
What do you say, Tabes?

1514
02:02:33,262 --> 02:02:34,763
A dime apiece.

1515
02:02:34,930 --> 02:02:36,681
No? You stick.

1516
02:02:36,849 --> 02:02:39,976
- He sticks.
- Sticks with a four.

1517
02:02:41,270 --> 02:02:43,271
Chessy's going for the ride.

1518
02:02:43,439 --> 02:02:45,231
- What does that mean?
- He wants a hit.

1519
02:02:45,399 --> 02:02:47,067
He wants a hit.
And a big queen.

1520
02:02:47,234 --> 02:02:48,443
I think you're busted.

1521
02:02:48,611 --> 02:02:49,986
Buggered, not busted.

1522
02:02:50,154 --> 02:02:51,696
- Turn them over.
- Buggered.

1523
02:02:51,864 --> 02:02:52,947
And weep.

1524
02:02:53,115 --> 02:02:55,325
- Hit me.
- Hit.

1525
02:02:55,493 --> 02:02:57,035
I think you're over.

1526
02:02:57,203 --> 02:02:58,244
I know you're over.

1527
02:02:59,580 --> 02:03:00,872
That's a three.

1528
02:03:12,802 --> 02:03:15,387
Mr. Sefelt?

1529
02:03:15,805 --> 02:03:17,472
Did everything go well?

1530
02:03:20,142 --> 02:03:24,562
That's very nice.
Now you feel better, don't you?

1531
02:03:24,730 --> 02:03:26,523
Yes, ma'am.

1532
02:03:27,733 --> 02:03:29,818
Deuce to the dealer.

1533
02:03:29,985 --> 02:03:32,112
Split them. Higher.

1534
02:03:32,780 --> 02:03:35,323
McMurphy is out.

1535
02:03:38,869 --> 02:03:40,829
McMurphy has escaped.

1536
02:03:42,164 --> 02:03:44,165
They were taking him
through the tunnel.

1537
02:03:44,333 --> 02:03:47,001
He beat up two of the
attendants and escaped.

1538
02:03:47,503 --> 02:03:51,047
- McMurphy's upstairs.
- Oh, no, no, no.

1539
02:03:51,215 --> 02:03:53,383
Jim, I'm telling you,
McMurphy is upstairs...

1540
02:03:53,551 --> 02:03:55,343
...and he's as meek as a lamb.

1541
02:03:55,511 --> 02:03:58,346
Really? I mean, how do you know?

1542
02:03:59,473 --> 02:04:03,017
- Jack Dunphy told me.
- Jack Dunphy's full of shit.

1543
02:04:03,185 --> 02:04:06,688
- Ha.
- Right. Right.

1544
02:04:54,403 --> 02:04:56,529
We got you.

1545
02:04:58,115 --> 02:05:00,116
There you go.

1546
02:05:55,172 --> 02:05:56,881
Mac.

1547
02:05:58,050 --> 02:06:00,802
They said you escaped.

1548
02:06:01,929 --> 02:06:06,808
I knew you wouldn't leave without me.
I was waiting for you.

1549
02:06:06,976 --> 02:06:12,188
Now we can make it, Mac.
I feel big as a damn mountain.

1550
02:06:29,999 --> 02:06:31,833
Oh, no.

1551
02:07:03,032 --> 02:07:06,034
I'm not going without you, Mac.

1552
02:07:07,953 --> 02:07:11,205
I wouldn't leave you here this way.

1553
02:07:20,424 --> 02:07:23,217
You're coming with me.

1554
02:07:43,906 --> 02:07:45,406
Let's go.
