1
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:18,090
Tonight, at the church of Taperoa...

2
00:00:18,301 --> 00:00:22,397
..."The Passion of Christ"!
- An adventure film!

3
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:25,301
One unarmed man...

4
00:00:25,508 --> 00:00:28,443
...faces the entire Roman empire!
- Don't miss it!

5
00:00:28,645 --> 00:00:31,808
The story of a creature
who is both man and God!

6
00:00:32,015 --> 00:00:36,475
A film of mystery, full of
miracles and amazing events!

7
00:00:36,753 --> 00:00:39,551
"The Passion of Christ",
the world's boldest film!

8
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,689
I'll go blind if it isn't!

9
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:44,917
"THE DOG'S WILL"

10
00:01:31,941 --> 00:01:34,603
- Anybody home?
- Hey, who's there?

11
00:01:34,811 --> 00:01:39,510
It’s me. It's only me.
I heard you needed a helper.

12
00:01:39,716 --> 00:01:41,616
Why do you ask?
Do you want to help?

13
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:45,082
Okay. I never say "no"
to help and money.

14
00:01:45,288 --> 00:01:49,315
- How much do you pay?
- I'm doing you a favor.

15
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,586
- I told you, you look like a fool!
- Are you unemployed?

16
00:01:52,962 --> 00:01:55,590
- Unemployed and starved.
- And dying to help!

17
00:01:55,965 --> 00:01:58,900
- Then the job is yours.
- Fine. The job is yours.

18
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:01,400
- How much is the pay?
- Not much.

19
00:02:01,604 --> 00:02:04,232
On the other hand,
the work is plenty.

20
00:02:04,474 --> 00:02:07,375
- So you need two helpers.
- For the price of one.

21
00:02:07,577 --> 00:02:09,772
- And how much is that?
- How much?

22
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,879
- Five crowns.
- Five crowns.

23
00:02:12,115 --> 00:02:14,845
- Is that good for you, Chico?
- It is for me.

24
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:18,578
So let’s do the math. Chico
works for two, gets paid for one.

25
00:02:19,022 --> 00:02:21,286
- I'll do all the work?
- Of course not...

26
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:22,924
but you can do half, can't you?

27
00:02:23,126 --> 00:02:25,219
- I guess so.
- It’s settled.

28
00:02:25,428 --> 00:02:28,727
He works for 2, gets paid for 1,
does half the chores.

29
00:02:28,932 --> 00:02:31,696
I work for 2 more, get paid for 1,
and do the other half.

30
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:36,530
- I said 2 for the price of 1!
- This is 4 for the price of 2...

31
00:02:36,773 --> 00:02:39,503
which comes out
the same, master!

32
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:43,044
- Is that right?
- Sure it is. Can't you add?

33
00:02:45,815 --> 00:02:47,749
It’s a deal.

34
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,581
There are more than
6O types of cuckolds.

35
00:02:51,955 --> 00:02:54,014
Wow! That’s more
than there are birds!

36
00:02:54,224 --> 00:02:57,523
The "hasty" type is
cuckolded before marriage...

37
00:02:57,727 --> 00:03:00,491
and the "careful" type
likes his wife well-dressed!

38
00:03:02,131 --> 00:03:06,067
Come on, dearie,
eat it, please!

39
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:09,396
Forgive my asking,
but do you talk to dogs?

40
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,900
I do. Why?
Do you want to talk to me?

41
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:16,237
- And does it listen?
- She listens...

42
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,380
but she doesn't
do what I say.

43
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:22,108
I've been begging her to eat
all day, but she just won't.

44
00:03:22,552 --> 00:03:26,010
- Lf it won't, I will!
- She's lost her appetite.

45
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:28,724
She barely ate today.

46
00:03:28,925 --> 00:03:31,519
We haven't even
gotten to the "barely"!

47
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:34,423
She had manioc and
milk in the morning...

48
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:38,133
- Manioc and milk...
...a tiny bit of cassava...

49
00:03:38,334 --> 00:03:40,063
A tiny bit of cassava...

50
00:03:40,336 --> 00:03:42,167
...and an itsy-bitsy serving
of chicken stew.

51
00:03:42,372 --> 00:03:44,567
Ah!
Chicken stew...

52
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:47,072
At around 1O a. M...

53
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,440
...she had a bowl of porridge.
- A bowl of porridge!

54
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:54,047
A tiny bowl,
because I begged her.

55
00:03:54,284 --> 00:03:57,185
If you beg me a little,
I swear I'll eat!

56
00:03:57,387 --> 00:04:00,584
Even if you don't,
we'll eat just the same.

57
00:04:00,924 --> 00:04:03,620
What nerve you've got!

58
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,420
You have your own food!

59
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:10,998
We feed you like kings,
and you ingrates complain!

60
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:15,230
Buttered steak, Chico!

61
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:19,132
Should I eat now
or look some more?

62
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:21,737
Jack, the bitch's
throwing a fit!

63
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:25,175
Damn!
It must have been the food!

64
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:28,851
God almighty!
Our food's been poisoned?

65
00:04:29,085 --> 00:04:32,646
For a bitch used to filet,
our hodgepodge is poison!

66
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,723
You'd better hurry to tell
the mistress the news.

67
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,852
Dona Dora!

68
00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:45,893
A terrible thing has happened
to one of your loved ones.

69
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:47,932
To hell with Eurico!

70
00:04:48,237 --> 00:04:52,264
I mean that little
bitch of yours.

71
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:56,008
Holy Virgin!
What happened to her?

72
00:04:57,814 --> 00:05:03,343
Help! My little bitch is sick!
Help me, Saint... Saint...

73
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:05,986
Who's the patron
saint of dogs?

74
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:09,283
Saint Francis, I think.
He used to speak to animals.

75
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,687
Help me Saint Francis of...

76
00:05:13,162 --> 00:05:14,993
Is he from Padua or Assisi?

77
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,131
That, I don't know.
You'd better ask the priest.

78
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,666
That’s it! Go get the priest
to bless my bitch!

79
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,633
- Bless the bitch?
- Yes!

80
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:26,170
The Bishop is coming. I doubt
the priest will bless the bitch.

81
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:29,140
Why not?
I once had a blessed horse.

82
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:32,710
Come on, Chico!
I'm up to here with your stories.

83
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:36,646
They're always strange.
And you explain by saying:

84
00:05:36,886 --> 00:05:38,513
"I don't know, but so it was."

85
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:42,213
But I did have the horse!
Should I say I didn't?

86
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:45,427
Because of your stories,
people say you can't be trusted.

87
00:05:45,628 --> 00:05:48,620
I can't be trusted?
Tom Marty can confirm it!

88
00:05:48,831 --> 00:05:51,231
Tom Marty's been
dead for 3 years!

89
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,868
- But he was alive when I had it.
- When you "had" it?

90
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,470
You mean you gave birth
to the horse?

91
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:59,266
No, but nothing
surprises me anymore.

92
00:05:59,475 --> 00:06:02,137
Last month, a woman
foaled a colt in Ceara.

93
00:06:02,378 --> 00:06:04,869
It’s the drought,
people starving.

94
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:07,549
They can't have babies,
so they have horses.

95
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,911
Horse's food is cheaper
and you can sell them.

96
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:15,682
- What was the blessed horse like?
- A finer horse, I'd never seen.

97
00:06:16,592 --> 00:06:20,790
Once we chased a heifer from
dawn to dusk without a rest.

98
00:06:20,997 --> 00:06:25,058
We started in Paraiba and before
I realized it, we were in Sergipe.

99
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,826
What about the
Sao Francisco River, Chico?

100
00:06:28,104 --> 00:06:30,402
You and your questions!

101
00:06:30,606 --> 00:06:33,040
Of course!
How did you cross it?

102
00:06:33,242 --> 00:06:36,177
Didn't I say the horse was blessed?
That’s why nothing surprises me.

103
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:39,439
Blessed horses, blessed dogs,
I've seen it all.

104
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,585
But your fibs won't
convince Father John.

105
00:06:43,886 --> 00:06:45,615
- A bitch?
- Yes.

106
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,551
- For me to bless?
- Yes.

107
00:06:47,757 --> 00:06:50,419
That’s crazy,
plain nonsense!

108
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:55,154
I told him you wouldn't.
He insisted, so here we are.

109
00:06:55,364 --> 00:06:58,197
There's no way
I'll do it!

110
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:00,596
I don't see anything
wrong with blessing it.

111
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:04,000
Didn't you bless
Major Moraes's new mill?

112
00:07:04,273 --> 00:07:07,106
A mill is something
everyone blesses.

113
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,278
But I've never heard
of blessing a bitch!

114
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:11,379
I like dogs better than mills.

115
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:14,516
But that will make
a laughing stock out of me.

116
00:07:14,817 --> 00:07:19,220
It’s fine to bless a mill,
everyone does it. But not a dog!

117
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:22,686
The priest is right, Chico.
People will mock him.

118
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:25,621
One thing is Major
Antonio Moraes' mill.

119
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,263
Another is Major
Antonio Moraes' bitch.

120
00:07:29,465 --> 00:07:31,194
What?

121
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:36,097
I said the Major's mill was one
thing, and his bitch, another.

122
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:40,241
So the bitch's owner, of whom
you speak, is Antonio Moraes?

123
00:07:40,476 --> 00:07:43,673
Yes. I didn't want to come,
because you'd be mad.

124
00:07:43,913 --> 00:07:46,438
But he's rich and powerful.
I work for him...

125
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:51,484
so I had to do it, or I'd lose my job.
But I told Chico you'd be angry.

126
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,416
No, Jack!

127
00:07:53,656 --> 00:07:57,057
What right has a Minister of God
to be angry?

128
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,455
So, you'll bless it, right?

129
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:02,388
- What do you think?
- It’s no big deal.

130
00:08:02,632 --> 00:08:07,968
I agree. There's no harm
in blessing God's creatures!

131
00:08:08,204 --> 00:08:10,138
So all's well with God!

132
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:13,433
The bitch will be blessed,
and everyone will be happy!

133
00:08:13,643 --> 00:08:16,339
Tell the Major to come.
I'll be waiting!

134
00:08:16,712 --> 00:08:18,907
Eurico, you sissy...

135
00:08:19,115 --> 00:08:22,607
...still cheating your customers?
- Major Antonio Moraes!

136
00:08:22,818 --> 00:08:25,150
I haven't seen you in town
in so long!

137
00:08:25,354 --> 00:08:29,313
This town stinks like cat shit!
I only came because I had to.

138
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:31,823
- And what brings you here?
- Remember my daughter?

139
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:36,965
Sure! Long hair, dark eyes,
wide shoulders, big breasts...

140
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,498
Stop right there or
you'll be in deep trouble!

141
00:08:39,702 --> 00:08:42,569
With all due respect!
She was only a child!

142
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,899
Well, Rosinha's been a little ill.

143
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:48,542
She's coming from Recife
to rest at the farm.

144
00:08:48,744 --> 00:08:53,078
Like all women,
she loves going to church!

145
00:08:53,316 --> 00:08:57,047
She asked me to get the priest
to give her his blessing.

146
00:08:57,253 --> 00:09:00,347
- What do we do now, Chico?
- I have nothing to do with it.

147
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,921
Holy Virgin! We have to stop him
before he sees the priest!

148
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:07,186
You made the mess.
Now, you sort it out.

149
00:09:07,396 --> 00:09:09,421
But you went with me!

150
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,566
- Now, help me out!
- No way!

151
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:15,533
Come on, Chico. You're used to these
matters. You had a blessed horse!

152
00:09:15,738 --> 00:09:21,404
Antonio Moraes may be a horse,
but he sure isn't blessed!

153
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:30,041
Major Moraes!
How are you?

154
00:09:30,253 --> 00:09:33,381
- Just as you can see.
- Great! Looking for the priest?

155
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:35,989
- You ask too much.
- Do you want me to get him?

156
00:09:36,225 --> 00:09:37,954
If I did, I'd have told you to.

157
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,618
Just so you're not shocked:
The priest is going mad.

158
00:09:42,231 --> 00:09:45,564
- The priest? Mad?
- Yes, the priest!

159
00:09:45,768 --> 00:09:49,397
He won't respect anyone
and wants to bless everything.

160
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:53,541
I brought him a message from
my boss, but I was ill-treated...

161
00:09:53,743 --> 00:09:56,177
...in spite of who my boss is.
- Who's your boss?

162
00:09:56,412 --> 00:10:00,781
The baker! He said he was a dog,
but he'd bless him anyway.

163
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:04,077
- That’s insane!
- I know, but It’s his thing.

164
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,311
He blesses everything
and calls you a dog.

165
00:10:06,555 --> 00:10:09,285
That with your boss.
With me, it’ll be different.

166
00:10:09,492 --> 00:10:12,325
- Forgive me, but I disagree.
- You disagree?

167
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,894
Yes, because he said...

168
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:17,622
"That dog puts on airs because
he's the Major's friend."

169
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,597
What are you saying?
Are you sure?

170
00:10:20,836 --> 00:10:23,361
Positive! The poor priest
has gone loony.

171
00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:27,197
I'll clear this up.
Someone will pay for this!

172
00:10:27,443 --> 00:10:31,573
- Can you spare some change?
- Get yourself a job!

173
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:34,249
I can't work, sir.
I only have one eye.

174
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,848
Poke the other one out
and sing at the fair!

175
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:42,650
It’s a great honor to see
Major Antonio Moraes in church!

176
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:46,225
It’s been a while since you
last visited God's house!

177
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:48,863
You mean I haven't been
to mass in a long time.

178
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:52,462
Not at all! I'm aware of
your duties, your health.

179
00:10:52,668 --> 00:10:56,035
You know I don't work
and my health is perfect!

180
00:10:57,707 --> 00:11:01,268
What brings you here?
You needn't tell me...

181
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,536
...the little one is sick.
- How did you know?

182
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:08,274
Word gets around
pretty quickly.

183
00:11:08,484 --> 00:11:10,748
- Does it stink yet?
- Stink? What?

184
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,111
- Your little one.
- No!

185
00:11:13,356 --> 00:11:17,258
- What do you mean by that?
- Nothing. Manner of speaking.

186
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,122
Well, this manner
of yours is very odd.

187
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:23,389
Forgive this old,
ignorant priest.

188
00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:26,999
- What ails her? The mange?
- The mange?

189
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:30,899
Yes. I've seen one die
of it within a few hours.

190
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,099
It started on her tail and
spread to her whole body.

191
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:36,977
On her "tail"?

192
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:39,807
I'm sorry.
I should've said "hindquarters".

193
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:44,145
We owe respect to the ill,
even if they are inferior beings.

194
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,684
"Inferior beings"?

195
00:11:47,523 --> 00:11:50,014
Father, beware!

196
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:54,559
The church is the pillar of society,
but there's a limit to everything!

197
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:58,528
- What did I say?
- "Inferior beings"!

198
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:02,431
My full name is Antonio
Noronha de Brito Moraes!

199
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,334
"Noronha de Brito" comes
from the Count of Arcs!

200
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,702
My people came
in the caravels!

201
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:12,074
Surely! And the little one's
forebears did too, right?

202
00:12:12,381 --> 00:12:16,112
Of course!
If mine did, so did hers.

203
00:12:16,385 --> 00:12:21,015
What are you insinuating?
That her mother is...

204
00:12:21,257 --> 00:12:24,055
- A bitch!
- What did you say?

205
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,229
- A bitch.
- Say it again!

206
00:12:27,463 --> 00:12:31,331
I see no harm in saying it.
Isn't her mother a bitch?

207
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:34,798
Were you not a priest, and
crazy at that, I'd kill you!

208
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,002
I'm going to talk
to the Bishop!

209
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:39,672
I won't bless it,
and that’s that!

210
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:43,768
I'm not prepared.
I have to think it over.

211
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:47,107
You mean blessing
the Major's bitch was fine...

212
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,715
but you have to think it over
when it’s my bitch?

213
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,514
My husband is the president
of the Brotherhood of Souls!

214
00:12:53,722 --> 00:12:56,623
- I'll make him resign!
- She'll make me resign!

215
00:12:56,992 --> 00:12:59,324
You won't get one
single loaf of bread!

216
00:12:59,562 --> 00:13:01,029
Not one!

217
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:04,460
- And you get your bread for free!
- You get it for free!

218
00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:08,403
And he pays for
the church repairs!

219
00:13:08,604 --> 00:13:11,232
I pay for the repairs!

220
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,874
- What’s all this about?
- What is it about?

221
00:13:14,076 --> 00:13:16,271
This is the voice
of truth, Father.

222
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:19,539
Now you'll see who
the baker's wife really is!

223
00:13:19,748 --> 00:13:22,615
- And what are you, then?
- The cow!

224
00:13:22,918 --> 00:13:25,512
The cow I lent you,
so you'd have milk.

225
00:13:25,754 --> 00:13:28,279
- I want it back today!
- Today!

226
00:13:28,524 --> 00:13:31,322
- Even the cow?
- You're overdoing it!

227
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,121
And didn't I tell you
to stay with the bitch?

228
00:13:35,331 --> 00:13:36,457
- Didn't she?
- She did.

229
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,235
- How is she?
- It’s still got four paws, a nose...

230
00:13:40,436 --> 00:13:42,768
- Don't tell me she's worse!
- I won't.

231
00:13:42,972 --> 00:13:45,406
- But is she? Tell us!
- Make up your minds!

232
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:47,872
Don't tell me you let her die!

233
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,103
- I didn't let her!
- Thank God!

234
00:13:51,347 --> 00:13:53,315
But you know
she never listens.

235
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,380
Chico! You should've
stayed with the bitch!

236
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,679
If I had, who'd have brought
the news of its death?

237
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,592
My little bitch is dead!

238
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,324
The bitch met its fate.

239
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:13,324
It met the only
irreparable doom...

240
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:16,899
that marks our strange
destiny on this Earth.

241
00:14:17,506 --> 00:14:18,973
The unexplainable fact...

242
00:14:19,174 --> 00:14:22,803
which puts all living things in one
flock of condemned creatures...

243
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,908
because all that lives
shall die.

244
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:31,315
"All that lives shall die."
Nice.

245
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,921
Where did you hear that?
You sure didn't make it up.

246
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,059
No, I didn't.
I heard it from a priest.

247
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,922
- When my pirarucu died.
- Your pirarucu?

248
00:14:41,196 --> 00:14:44,791
Actually, I think I was his.
Didn't I tell you about him?

249
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,834
No. I've heard of men owning fish,
but not the other way around!

250
00:14:49,038 --> 00:14:50,471
It was when I was in Amazonas.

251
00:14:51,674 --> 00:14:55,041
I wrapped the harpoon rope
around my body and my arms.

252
00:14:55,244 --> 00:14:57,804
When it bit, it pulled me
into the river.

253
00:14:58,247 --> 00:15:01,341
- The fish caught you.
- Exactly! It caught me.

254
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:05,179
In short, it dragged me
for 3 days and 3 nights.

255
00:15:05,387 --> 00:15:08,356
3 days and 3 nights?
Weren't you hungry?

256
00:15:08,557 --> 00:15:12,084
No, but I was
dying for a smoke!

257
00:15:12,294 --> 00:15:15,593
When it died, I waved my hands
and some people freed me.

258
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:17,698
But weren't your hands tied?

259
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,835
When things get tough,
you find a solution.

260
00:15:21,036 --> 00:15:25,166
- What did you do?
- I don't know, but so it was.

261
00:15:25,374 --> 00:15:28,070
My little bitchie!

262
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,878
We must all
resign ourselves.

263
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:45,055
If you had blessed the little critter
she'd still be alive!

264
00:15:45,294 --> 00:15:47,489
I don't have that power.

265
00:15:47,763 --> 00:15:51,199
Just one thing: You have
to give her a decent burial!

266
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,265
A funeral for the bitch?

267
00:15:53,469 --> 00:15:56,302
Yes, and it has to be in Latin.

268
00:15:56,505 --> 00:15:59,599
- Or else, it won't do.
- In Latin, it won't do.

269
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,275
- In Latin, it will do!
- Yes, in Latin, it will do!

270
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:07,515
You're all crazy!
I'm not giving the bitch a funeral!

271
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,685
The Brotherhood will
lose its funding!

272
00:16:10,953 --> 00:16:15,253
- I won't do it!
- The Brotherhood has lost its funding!

273
00:16:15,457 --> 00:16:19,325
- I won't do it!
- My husband resigns the presidency!

274
00:16:19,595 --> 00:16:23,031
- I won't do it!
- I resign the presidency!

275
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,258
- I won't do it!
- The little cow...

276
00:16:26,468 --> 00:16:30,768
will be taken from the
church right away!

277
00:16:31,373 --> 00:16:35,639
- You heartless woman!
- Heartless?

278
00:16:35,878 --> 00:16:40,042
Because I don't want to see
the buzzards eat my bitch?

279
00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:46,516
- Will you bury her or not?
- Lf it were up to God, I'd do it.

280
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,588
The problem is the Bishop!

281
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:53,123
All you'll ever get is stale bread,
cash up-front!

282
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:56,092
- You cruel woman!
- And for double the price!

283
00:16:56,298 --> 00:16:58,198
- Can you spare some change?
- No.

284
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,528
- Help a poor one-eyed beggar!
- Why should I?

285
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,500
- Did I poke your eye out?
- No, sir, you didn't.

286
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:09,107
I can poke the other eye out,
so I'd have to give you money.

287
00:17:09,378 --> 00:17:13,576
The bitch stays until
the priest agrees to bury her.

288
00:17:13,816 --> 00:17:16,876
But, dear, she's
starting to smell.

289
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,522
Then you leave!
Maybe the stench won't be so bad!

290
00:17:23,392 --> 00:17:25,792
Give me a free hand,
and I'll get the bitch buried.

291
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:30,263
- You've got it.
- Can I loose the purse strings?

292
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:33,490
- Yes!
- This is going to be easy!

293
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:37,260
- What are you up to getting?
- I'm getting the bitch a funeral.

294
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,498
And in Latin!

295
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,244
- Father John?
- What is it?

296
00:17:47,449 --> 00:17:52,546
- I'm here for the cow.
- What a heartless woman!

297
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:57,790
If I could, I'd bury the bitch,
the cat, whatever!

298
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,756
But the Bishop is in town!

299
00:17:59,962 --> 00:18:03,022
These folks are nuts.
They think pets are people.

300
00:18:03,232 --> 00:18:07,635
The bitch even had a will
naming you as a beneficiary.

301
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,033
Wait a minute!
A bitch with a will?

302
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,901
She was a smart bitch!

303
00:18:13,742 --> 00:18:16,267
When she was
on her deathbed...

304
00:18:16,478 --> 00:18:19,743
she'd look towards the church
every time the bells tolled.

305
00:18:19,982 --> 00:18:24,009
Finally, my boss understood:
She wanted a Christian burial.

306
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:26,813
My boss had to promise to add
5O crowns to the bitch's will...

307
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:30,320
which would go to the priest,
for the funeral.

308
00:18:30,826 --> 00:18:35,126
What a bright animal!
What noble feelings!

309
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:40,859
But, without a funeral, this part
of the will can't be executed.

310
00:18:41,103 --> 00:18:43,571
Now, the bitch's going
to be eaten by buzzards.

311
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:46,138
That’s not going to happen!

312
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,742
- What about the will? Where is it?
- It’s been legally registered.

313
00:18:49,978 --> 00:18:52,572
A bitch like that can't
be eaten by buzzards!

314
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:53,805
I agree!

315
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:18,606
- Here it is, Father.
- There's no hurry.

316
00:19:23,312 --> 00:19:28,045
The Bishop! I didn't expect
Your Grace just yet, so...

317
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:32,413
Never mind. As the French
would say, "let it pass".

318
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:36,789
But there are certain things
I can't easily let pass.

319
00:19:36,992 --> 00:19:39,961
- I don't know what you mean.
- You will...

320
00:19:40,195 --> 00:19:44,393
when I tell you I spoke
to Antonio Moraes.

321
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,831
- Antonio Moraes went to you?
- Yes, indeed.

322
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:51,597
He complained about
your behavior towards him.

323
00:19:51,807 --> 00:19:54,002
I don't know what you mean.

324
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:56,939
I don't see why
it’s so hard to grasp.

325
00:19:57,145 --> 00:20:01,104
He said you were
extremely rude to him.

326
00:20:01,316 --> 00:20:03,750
- He did?
- Let’s be serious, Father John!

327
00:20:03,986 --> 00:20:06,819
You know exactly
what I'm talking about!

328
00:20:07,055 --> 00:20:09,615
Why did you call
his wife a bitch?

329
00:20:10,025 --> 00:20:12,084
- Who, me?
- Yes, you!

330
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,092
I swear I never called
his wife a bitch!

331
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,798
- You did, Father John.
- I didn't, Your Grace.

332
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:21,298
- Yes, you did, Father John.
- I didn't, Your Grace.

333
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,835
- You did, Father John!
- I did, Bishop.

334
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:27,505
Well, did you or did you not?

335
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:33,648
I didn't. But if you say I did,
you must know better.

336
00:20:33,882 --> 00:20:38,410
So it isn't true that he asked
you to bless his daughter...

337
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,282
and you called his wife
a bitch?

338
00:20:41,924 --> 00:20:43,448
- His daughter?
- Yes, his daughter.

339
00:20:43,725 --> 00:20:47,923
- He meant his daughter?
- Yes, that’s what I'm saying.

340
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:51,030
The Cricket told me
it was for the bitch!

341
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:56,431
Who? Is this a joke? What is this
story of crickets and bitches?

342
00:20:56,638 --> 00:20:59,732
Forgive me, Your Grace,
but now I understand!

343
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:02,069
Now, I don't understand!

344
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:04,643
Why did you call me a rascal?

345
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,872
Because that’s what you are!

346
00:21:08,116 --> 00:21:10,607
It doesn't say that
on my birth certificate!

347
00:21:10,886 --> 00:21:15,255
You rascal! Now explain
to the Bishop the story...

348
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,924
about Major Moraes'
bitch being sick...

349
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,755
and why I ended up
calling his wife a bitch.

350
00:21:22,831 --> 00:21:26,096
Is that why I'm a rascal?
That’s nothing!

351
00:21:26,401 --> 00:21:29,734
It’s much worse to bury a bitch in
Latin, in a Christian funeral...

352
00:21:30,005 --> 00:21:33,065
and even then I wouldn't
call you a rascal!

353
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:36,402
- What’s wrong?
- Suddenly, I'm in pain!

354
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:42,309
Poor Father! But you should have
heard my mistress at the funeral.

355
00:21:42,517 --> 00:21:45,714
Help me, Jack the Cricket,
dear friend, I'm dying!

356
00:21:45,921 --> 00:21:50,756
Me? Who am I to help a priest?
I'm nothing but a rascal!

357
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:54,019
- I take it back!
- Take it back...

358
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:58,791
...but the bitch was buried in Latin.
- A bitch? Buried in Latin?

359
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:03,399
He means it was barking.
"Bowwow", you know?

360
00:22:03,672 --> 00:22:07,369
No, I don't. I've never
seen a dead dog bark.

361
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:09,709
What’s going on?

362
00:22:11,046 --> 00:22:14,607
What’s the matter?
The ruckus has just begun.

363
00:22:16,618 --> 00:22:20,315
Is that true?
A bitch buried in Latin?

364
00:22:20,522 --> 00:22:24,959
- Why? Is it forbidden?
- You'll be suspended, Father!

365
00:22:26,828 --> 00:22:31,527
As for you, Jack the Cricket
you'll regret your tricks.

366
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,928
Pitting the church
against Antonio Moraes!

367
00:22:35,137 --> 00:22:37,867
It’s a shame, a disgrace!

368
00:22:38,073 --> 00:22:41,133
Yes, indeed,
it’s a shame, a disgrace!

369
00:22:41,376 --> 00:22:44,607
A mongrel like that,
daring to leave a priest...

370
00:22:44,813 --> 00:22:47,782
...and a bishop money in her will!
- What?

371
00:22:49,051 --> 00:22:51,542
You mean you haven't
heard of the will?

372
00:22:52,187 --> 00:22:56,920
- Will? What will?
- The bitch's will.

373
00:22:57,159 --> 00:22:59,923
The bitch's will?

374
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:03,529
Yes, bishop.
The bitch left a will...

375
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,393
a folly of her owner.

376
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,365
It left 5O crowns to the parish...

377
00:23:09,604 --> 00:23:12,630
1OO to the diocese.

378
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:19,147
That’s why I always say animals
are God's creatures, too!

379
00:23:19,381 --> 00:23:22,839
What a bright animal!
What noble feelings!

380
00:23:23,051 --> 00:23:27,112
At the owner's request,
I allowed it accompanied...

381
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,721
- The funeral?
- Yes, the funeral.

382
00:23:28,957 --> 00:23:33,758
- In Latin?
- I uttered only a few words, really.

383
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:38,365
"Blah, blah, blah,
defunctorum, Amen!"

384
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,959
We must mull it over.
It’s a matter worth discussing.

385
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,832
Let’s call the congregation.

386
00:23:45,974 --> 00:23:49,705
- How are you? Do you feel better?
- Feel better?

387
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:54,939
How could I? I lost my bitch and
spent 15O crowns on the funeral.

388
00:23:55,217 --> 00:23:58,812
It was cheap, for a priest
to bless a critter.

389
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,488
I once saw a critter
bless a man for 2OO.

390
00:24:01,756 --> 00:24:05,749
- What critter was that?
- A parrot I had.

391
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:11,595
He was born in a seminary and
he learned the Bible by heart!

392
00:24:13,435 --> 00:24:16,836
Then, I moved to a town
without a priest.

393
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,633
- The parrot dispensed sacraments.
- What happened to the parrot?

394
00:24:20,842 --> 00:24:24,334
He became a Protestant and left to
a Baptist church in Gloria de Goita.

395
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:28,080
- I heard he died of old age.
- How could that be...

396
00:24:28,283 --> 00:24:32,811
if you say you saw its birth?
Parrots live to be over 1OO.

397
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:36,751
- I don't know, but so it was.
- Chico...

398
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:41,395
I've been so terribly lonely
since my little bitch died!

399
00:24:41,663 --> 00:24:46,123
- You should get another pet.
- And what would you suggest?

400
00:24:46,368 --> 00:24:48,199
A canary, to cheer you up.

401
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:53,733
I want a bigger pet.
My loneliness is very big.

402
00:24:54,176 --> 00:24:56,303
A rabbit, a guinea pig...

403
00:24:56,811 --> 00:24:58,540
Bigger!

404
00:24:58,813 --> 00:25:04,251
- A dog, a goat...
- Bigger, bigger!

405
00:25:04,886 --> 00:25:08,515
- I think I get it!
- And are you going to stand there?

406
00:25:08,823 --> 00:25:11,519
- What if Eurico walks in?
- Are you scared?

407
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,318
Scared? Me?

408
00:25:13,628 --> 00:25:16,620
I'll grab him by the horns,
spin him around and shake him up!

409
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,123
- Will you, really?
- I will!

410
00:25:19,367 --> 00:25:23,303
Oh! I love a tough man!
Say it again!

411
00:25:23,538 --> 00:25:25,836
I'll shake him and shake him...

412
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:31,708
So come on and shake me up
a little, tough guy!

413
00:25:31,913 --> 00:25:33,847
- Like this?
- Yes!

414
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:37,846
- What do I do now?
- I'm supposed to ask you.

415
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,315
What do you want me to do?

416
00:25:40,555 --> 00:25:42,386
- Me?
- Yes!

417
00:25:42,657 --> 00:25:46,457
- Say you're the man around here.
- I'm the man around here!

418
00:25:46,728 --> 00:25:50,494
- Say it again!
- I am the...

419
00:25:51,032 --> 00:25:55,230
- Dora?
- I forgot I had a date with Vince!

420
00:25:55,437 --> 00:25:58,133
It’s cheat and be cheated on,
all in one go!

421
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,671
Open up, Dora!

422
00:26:00,075 --> 00:26:03,442
Big Vince will kill us
if he catches you here!

423
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:07,172
- Who's Big Vince?
- Don't you know Big Vince?

424
00:26:07,415 --> 00:26:10,248
He beat up Mr. Golias,
from the drugstore.

425
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:13,750
- Help me, my St. David!
- And pelted Big Ernest.

426
00:26:14,022 --> 00:26:15,512
Enough!
I don't want to hear it!

427
00:26:15,724 --> 00:26:18,852
- I'd rather not know him!
- What should I do?

428
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,858
I don't know! It’s your house!
You're in charge.

429
00:26:22,063 --> 00:26:25,123
- Open the door!
- What do I do now?

430
00:26:25,767 --> 00:26:28,258
I'll think of something.

431
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,205
Damn, I'm angry, today!

432
00:26:33,408 --> 00:26:36,070
I've got the Devil
under my skin!

433
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:38,974
Why didn't you open the door
when I told you to?

434
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,172
What do you mean?
It’s wide open!

435
00:26:42,951 --> 00:26:45,317
And what took you so long?

436
00:26:45,987 --> 00:26:50,890
Didn't you tell me
to dress up for you?

437
00:26:51,092 --> 00:26:55,688
- Yes, I did.
- So I was dressing up.

438
00:26:55,897 --> 00:26:58,866
After all, who's the man
around here?

439
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:00,557
Do I have to say it?

440
00:27:00,802 --> 00:27:04,829
You don't have to,
but, if you want to...

441
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,769
I'm the man around here!

442
00:27:07,008 --> 00:27:09,602
Oh, I love a tough man!

443
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,642
- Say it again!
- I'm the man around here!

444
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,348
Again!

445
00:27:14,616 --> 00:27:15,605
I'm the man...

446
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,484
Dora!

447
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,950
- It’s my husband!
- Now, we're screwed!

448
00:27:21,156 --> 00:27:22,783
Dora!

449
00:27:23,758 --> 00:27:26,693
- What do I do?
- Beats me!

450
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,728
It’s your house.
You're in charge.

451
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:31,330
What do I do now?

452
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:34,331
Pretend you came here
after someone.

453
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,901
I don't get it!

454
00:27:37,105 --> 00:27:38,595
You don't have to.

455
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,968
Get your knife and
run out shouting...

456
00:27:42,177 --> 00:27:45,078
"I'll get you, you bastard!"
Got it?

457
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,713
I'll get you, you bastard.

458
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,712
Dora, I'm losing my temper!

459
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,818
- I'll get you, you bastard.
- That’s it!

460
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,113
I'll get you, you bastard!

461
00:27:54,322 --> 00:27:57,780
- I'll get you, you bastard!
- What the hell's going on?

462
00:27:58,026 --> 00:28:00,494
You got here just in time!

463
00:28:00,695 --> 00:28:04,825
- In time for what?
- Vince wanted to kill Chico!

464
00:28:05,033 --> 00:28:06,432
Who's Chico?

465
00:28:06,634 --> 00:28:09,159
Come on out, Chico,
he's gone.

466
00:28:09,838 --> 00:28:12,363
- Good evening, boss.
- He's so pale!

467
00:28:12,574 --> 00:28:16,237
He'll be even paler unless
he tells me what’s going on.

468
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,843
Big Vince...

469
00:28:18,313 --> 00:28:21,646
swore he'd kill Chico,
and decided to do it here.

470
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:24,717
- Right here, in our home!
- In your home!

471
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,051
- So, he swore he'd kill you?
- Yes!

472
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:31,623
On his mother's soul,
may she rest in peace.

473
00:28:31,826 --> 00:28:36,126
- Lf it weren't for you...
- You're such a wimp, Chico!

474
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:37,764
Why didn't you fight him?

475
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,059
I would've beat him up!

476
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:43,662
Oh, I love a tough man!

477
00:28:45,907 --> 00:28:49,035
A job, a task, a duty...
I'll take anything.

478
00:28:49,244 --> 00:28:51,804
Your reputation
isn't that great.

479
00:28:52,013 --> 00:28:55,141
Major, people expect
the poor to be perfect.

480
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:58,376
They say you're a rascal,
a good-for-nothing!

481
00:28:58,586 --> 00:29:00,986
Sir, so many qualities are
demanded that I doubt...

482
00:29:01,189 --> 00:29:03,680
any master could get a job!

483
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:07,786
Let’s make a bet.
I'll ask you 3 questions.

484
00:29:08,296 --> 00:29:10,662
If you get them right...

485
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:13,195
...you've got the job.
- Let’s do it!

486
00:29:13,401 --> 00:29:14,766
I've got nothing to lose.

487
00:29:14,969 --> 00:29:19,201
Yes, you do. If you don't,
I'll strip the skin off your back.

488
00:29:19,407 --> 00:29:21,136
- Oh, damn!
- Well?

489
00:29:21,643 --> 00:29:25,409
It’s a deal, but I have to
talk my shaking legs into it!

490
00:29:25,613 --> 00:29:27,478
Okay, here's the first...

491
00:29:28,283 --> 00:29:31,116
how far is it from one end
of the world to the other?

492
00:29:32,153 --> 00:29:35,122
A day's journey!
That’s how long the sun takes!

493
00:29:35,323 --> 00:29:37,621
- What’s over a king's head?
- The crown!

494
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:41,226
- What am I thinking now?
- Of beating me!

495
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:43,056
Very well, Jack the Cricket.

496
00:29:43,264 --> 00:29:45,164
So you really are smart.

497
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:48,460
You're even smarter,
since you're my master now.

498
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:52,868
So go fetch my daughter in town.
She's coming in from Recife.

499
00:29:53,074 --> 00:29:54,541
The Major, Jack?

500
00:29:54,742 --> 00:29:57,939
- But the Major's mean!
- As if the baker's any better!

501
00:29:58,146 --> 00:30:01,877
I want revenge for what they
did to me when I was sick.

502
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:05,814
I was in bed for 3 days,
without a single glass of water!

503
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,488
While the bitch got steak!

504
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:11,454
I hate people who like
pets better than humans!

505
00:30:17,265 --> 00:30:18,789
Do you want to die?

506
00:30:19,033 --> 00:30:22,469
I'll die, but I'll
take you all with me!

507
00:30:23,505 --> 00:30:25,735
- Mr. Severino?
- Does anyone else look like me?

508
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:30,440
- I didn't have to kill anyone!
- Stop being such a sissy!

509
00:30:30,645 --> 00:30:33,136
I don't like to kill people.
I'll do it, but I don't like it.

510
00:30:33,348 --> 00:30:37,375
- Where were you going without me?
- We were going to look for you.

511
00:30:38,453 --> 00:30:43,186
I checked the whole town,
and there's no police.

512
00:30:43,391 --> 00:30:46,019
And no one gave me a cent!

513
00:30:46,227 --> 00:30:49,685
That’s why I steal. I don't like to,
but asking just doesn't work.

514
00:30:49,898 --> 00:30:52,833
But that’s okay, because
now I hate them even more!

515
00:30:53,034 --> 00:30:56,697
There won't be a soul left
in town to tell the story!

516
00:30:56,905 --> 00:31:00,102
It'll be easier than
slapping a drunk!

517
00:31:03,511 --> 00:31:05,308
Left, right, left, right.

518
00:31:05,513 --> 00:31:07,105
Left, right, left, right.

519
00:31:07,348 --> 00:31:08,781
Halt!

520
00:31:08,983 --> 00:31:12,248
The 2Oth platoon wishes to
salute the people of this town!

521
00:31:12,487 --> 00:31:16,184
Itaperoa can now wage war...

522
00:31:16,391 --> 00:31:18,825
against Brazil!

523
00:31:19,027 --> 00:31:21,393
Corporal Setenta,
at your service.

524
00:31:21,696 --> 00:31:24,290
I might take you up on that!

525
00:31:24,499 --> 00:31:26,797
They're all sissies.
I know the sort.

526
00:31:27,001 --> 00:31:31,165
They need those uniforms
to prove that they're men!

527
00:31:31,372 --> 00:31:34,000
Corporal, let me introduce you.

528
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:37,109
This is Eurico, my husband.
Big Vince is my...

529
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:40,138
Our friend.

530
00:31:41,115 --> 00:31:43,709
Pleased to meet you!

531
00:31:46,554 --> 00:31:48,818
My, how you've grown, Rosinha!

532
00:31:49,057 --> 00:31:51,617
You're so pretty,
so well-built...

533
00:31:52,093 --> 00:31:54,584
That’s kind of you,
Mr. Eurico!

534
00:31:54,796 --> 00:31:56,263
I've been a little ill...

535
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,761
that’s why I'm here.

536
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,298
When will you be leaving?
I mean...

537
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:05,302
...how long will you be staying?
- Lf I could, I'd stay forever...

538
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,337
but mother won't leave the city.

539
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:10,238
I'd live there if I could.

540
00:32:10,445 --> 00:32:14,506
There are too many jerks
around here.

541
00:32:14,716 --> 00:32:17,685
Excuse me. I have to go to church
before going to the farm.

542
00:32:17,885 --> 00:32:19,477
The Bishop's giving
out his blessing!

543
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:23,054
The Bishop?
It’d be a sin to miss that mass!

544
00:32:23,257 --> 00:32:27,557
Excuse me!
The military must salute the clergy!

545
00:32:27,795 --> 00:32:31,993
- Isn't there a novena, today?
- You, however, are excused.

546
00:32:47,482 --> 00:32:48,779
Hi, Chico!

547
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,649
There you are!

548
00:32:50,852 --> 00:32:52,717
Having a good time
while I have to work!

549
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,751
You do?

550
00:32:54,956 --> 00:32:56,514
Have you been drinking?

551
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:57,986
What?

552
00:32:58,192 --> 00:33:00,387
Never mind.
Mass is about to start.

553
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:02,790
- Who's he?
- Chico.

554
00:33:03,031 --> 00:33:05,761
- Chico who?
- Just say "Chico". He'll come.

555
00:33:05,967 --> 00:33:08,936
I just got a craving for a sweet.
Get me a cone!

556
00:33:09,137 --> 00:33:11,970
- What about the mass?
- I need it right away!

557
00:33:12,173 --> 00:33:13,970
- And the blessing?
- I need a sweet!

558
00:33:14,175 --> 00:33:16,109
I'll buy you one.

559
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:18,437
- At your service!
- Get me a sweet!

560
00:33:18,646 --> 00:33:21,206
- A sweet?
- Yes. Right, march!

561
00:33:23,184 --> 00:33:25,243
Thank you, Chico.

562
00:33:25,453 --> 00:33:27,580
- How do you know my name?
- I guessed it.

563
00:33:28,156 --> 00:33:31,125
- Your sweet.
- Chico already got me one.

564
00:33:31,325 --> 00:33:33,589
- But you asked me!
- He guessed.

565
00:33:33,795 --> 00:33:35,592
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

566
00:33:35,797 --> 00:33:38,265
Everyone reads
minds around here!

567
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:03,856
<i>Someone is offering</i>
<i>this song to Rosinha</i>.

568
00:34:04,058 --> 00:34:07,516
<i>He says that he won't say</i>
<i>who he is</i>...

569
00:34:07,729 --> 00:34:10,721
<i>because she'll have to guess</i>.

570
00:34:23,444 --> 00:34:24,536
Rosinha!

571
00:34:24,746 --> 00:34:28,807
You're all grown up now,
and I have to protect your honor.

572
00:34:29,016 --> 00:34:30,813
You'll get married
before leaving.

573
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:35,452
- Me, Father?
- Yes, you! Don't play dumb!

574
00:34:35,923 --> 00:34:37,481
Here's your dowry.

575
00:34:37,692 --> 00:34:40,024
This piggy bank belonged
to your great-grandmother...

576
00:34:40,228 --> 00:34:42,753
Rosa Benigna Vaz de Medeiros.

577
00:34:42,964 --> 00:34:46,127
Every day, she'd
deposit a coin in it.

578
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:49,792
When she died, she left it to you
as a wedding gift.

579
00:34:50,037 --> 00:34:52,232
You were named after her.

580
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,466
I pray to God the good lady
lived a long life!

581
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:57,871
She lived to be almost 1OO.

582
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,479
This pig is full of money.

583
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:04,811
You have to find a brave,
educated man to marry.

584
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,214
How, father?
I don't like anyone!

585
00:35:07,421 --> 00:35:10,584
Nonsense!
You'll learn to love him.

586
00:35:11,325 --> 00:35:13,520
Oh, Virgin Mary!

587
00:35:13,728 --> 00:35:15,525
I'm being forced into marriage!

588
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:19,723
Don't worry!
You'll find someone you like.

589
00:35:19,934 --> 00:35:22,494
With your beauty
and this pig...

590
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,671
you'll have plenty
of men to choose from.

591
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:27,864
I can't eat.
I'm completely in love.

592
00:35:28,075 --> 00:35:30,600
- Why don't you tell her?
- I'm too poor.

593
00:35:30,812 --> 00:35:33,610
- Marry her and you'll be rich.
- But how?

594
00:35:33,815 --> 00:35:35,043
I can tell you how...

595
00:35:35,249 --> 00:35:37,274
but don't forget me
after you're rich.

596
00:35:37,485 --> 00:35:39,783
I won't need money,
if I don't eat.

597
00:35:39,987 --> 00:35:42,251
Marry her.
You'll start eating again.

598
00:35:42,456 --> 00:35:45,516
And you'll also get
a piggy bank full of money...

599
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,318
from her great-grandmother.

600
00:35:47,528 --> 00:35:50,861
- You get half if you set it up.
- It’s a done deal!

601
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,999
I'm going to see
the corporal right away.

602
00:35:53,201 --> 00:35:56,068
The corporal?
Are you trying to help or what?

603
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:59,671
He's crazy for her!
If he finds out, he'll kill me...

604
00:35:59,874 --> 00:36:01,501
and so will Big Vince!

605
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:04,337
With my plan,
you'll chase them both off...

606
00:36:04,545 --> 00:36:06,274
and still marry Rosinha!

607
00:36:17,325 --> 00:36:19,225
Good morning!
How are you?

608
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,985
What’s all this intimacy?

609
00:36:21,195 --> 00:36:24,961
What’s the problem? Can't I even
say good morning, Corporal?

610
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:27,430
I'm just being courteous
and civil...

611
00:36:27,635 --> 00:36:29,193
am I right?

612
00:36:29,403 --> 00:36:31,837
I hate people who say
"Am I right?"

613
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:33,563
It drives me crazy!

614
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:35,843
- It does?
- Yes.

615
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:40,577
But old habits are hard to break.
Am I right?

616
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,442
I'll throw you in jail!

617
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:46,347
- I'm dying to lock someone up!
- No need for such bullying!

618
00:36:46,554 --> 00:36:48,818
I'd like to see you
do this to Vince!

619
00:36:49,023 --> 00:36:53,357
Are you suggesting that I,
a Corporal, am afraid of a thug?

620
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:56,689
No, no!
Only that it takes two to fight.

621
00:36:56,898 --> 00:36:58,832
- Am I right?
- Watch it, boy!

622
00:36:59,033 --> 00:37:02,298
- I'm sorry, Corporal!
- I'll let it pass this time...

623
00:37:02,503 --> 00:37:04,198
but only because of one thing.

624
00:37:04,405 --> 00:37:06,669
- I think I know what.
- No, you don't!

625
00:37:06,941 --> 00:37:12,208
Yes, I do! I know the hidden secrets
of your military heart.

626
00:37:12,413 --> 00:37:14,904
What kind of intimacy is this?

627
00:37:15,116 --> 00:37:17,016
I know you could arrest me.

628
00:37:17,251 --> 00:37:21,483
You're being nice because
I work for a certain lady...

629
00:37:21,689 --> 00:37:24,021
you are very fond of.

630
00:37:25,526 --> 00:37:28,825
- It’s too much suffering, Jack!
- Suffering?

631
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,759
You, an authority?

632
00:37:30,965 --> 00:37:34,298
Authorities also suffer.
She doesn't like me.

633
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,665
- Says who?
- That’s what I think.

634
00:37:37,872 --> 00:37:40,534
Thinking can be misleading.
Am I right?

635
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:44,837
- I wish it were so.
- I've spoken to her about this.

636
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:47,240
- You haven't!
- I swear to God.

637
00:37:47,448 --> 00:37:50,645
She even told me she had eyes
for a certain corporal.

638
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:53,342
- Do you swear?
- By this very light.

639
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:57,419
Jack, you know I like you a lot,
don't you?

640
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:59,252
Look how he's changed!

641
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,224
Yes, I know you're
crazy about me.

642
00:38:02,463 --> 00:38:04,021
Am I right?

643
00:38:04,231 --> 00:38:05,823
Yes!

644
00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:09,161
Yes, I am.
And you could help me out.

645
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,304
Anything you say.

646
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,531
I'd like you to take
a brooch to Rosinha...

647
00:38:14,742 --> 00:38:17,210
...and tell her it’s from me.
- Hand it over.

648
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,240
What a beautiful brooch!

649
00:38:19,447 --> 00:38:22,610
- Almost a full month's salary.
- I'll see that she gets it.

650
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:25,978
- See you!
- See you! Thanks!

651
00:38:26,187 --> 00:38:28,553
I owe you a favor!

652
00:38:31,158 --> 00:38:33,854
- Good Morning, Vince.
- I'll pretend I didn't see you.

653
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:36,154
I woke up in a bad mood.

654
00:38:36,364 --> 00:38:40,391
I swore I'd stab
the first person I saw.

655
00:38:40,601 --> 00:38:45,038
- But you shouldn't be angry today.
- I'll be angry any day I want!

656
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,969
I want to be angry,
and it’s none of your business!

657
00:38:48,175 --> 00:38:50,700
But on Rosinha's birthday?

658
00:38:50,978 --> 00:38:54,641
- Is it her birthday?
- You'd better calm down.

659
00:38:54,849 --> 00:38:56,373
Why?

660
00:38:56,717 --> 00:38:59,015
- She doesn't like me anyway.
- How unfair!

661
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:02,189
Today, she told me
she was in love.

662
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,290
She did?
And with whom?

663
00:39:04,492 --> 00:39:06,119
With the town bully,
she said.

664
00:39:06,327 --> 00:39:10,525
- That can only be me!
- But you're in such a bad mood!

665
00:39:10,731 --> 00:39:12,062
It’s gone, Jack.

666
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:15,497
- Would you grant me a courtesy?
- A courtesy?

667
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,938
Would you give her
these earrings?

668
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,802
I bought them today.
What a coincidence!

669
00:39:22,076 --> 00:39:26,240
I bought her a present,
and it’s her birthday!

670
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,608
It’s no coincidence.
It’s fate!

671
00:39:29,817 --> 00:39:31,785
Fate's action
gives me goose bumps!

672
00:39:31,986 --> 00:39:33,681
Tell her that.

673
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,186
Tell her chance
wants us together...

674
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:39,791
and has joined our lives
in the web of fate!

675
00:39:39,994 --> 00:39:42,258
She'll like them a lot.

676
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:45,563
What a plan I'm concocting!

677
00:39:46,033 --> 00:39:49,628
- Who sent this beautiful jewelry?
- Someone who's crazy about you.

678
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:52,964
- But no one likes me.
- This guy likes you a lot.

679
00:39:53,174 --> 00:39:54,801
- Who is he?
- I can't tell you.

680
00:39:55,009 --> 00:39:56,943
- Is he handsome?
- I'm too modest to say.

681
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:59,135
- It’s you, Chico!
- I won't deny.

682
00:39:59,346 --> 00:40:01,314
Since I met you,
I've felt like dying...

683
00:40:01,515 --> 00:40:03,540
but have lived to think of you.

684
00:40:03,751 --> 00:40:07,619
I thank you, but I can't
accept your gifts.

685
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:11,280
- I know I'm poor.
- I don't care about that, Chico.

686
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,756
But if you at least
had a degree!

687
00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:16,259
I'm a Ph.D. In hidden sciences,
dramatic philosophy...

688
00:40:16,464 --> 00:40:19,331
dogmatic biology, charlatanic
perversion, electronic astrology.

689
00:40:19,533 --> 00:40:22,696
- Lf only you were brave...
- I'm the bravest man around.

690
00:40:22,903 --> 00:40:24,461
You aren't!

691
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,573
The bravest men here are
Vince and the Corporal.

692
00:40:27,775 --> 00:40:29,402
I'd gladly finish them off!

693
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:33,979
- Would you face one of them?
- Both. I'll chase them away.

694
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:37,207
- I'd like to see that!
- Will you take the jewelry?

695
00:40:37,418 --> 00:40:38,908
I will.

696
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,578
And if you do what you said,
I may even wear it!

697
00:40:45,826 --> 00:40:49,091
My friend, you're finally here!

698
00:40:49,296 --> 00:40:51,924
I was hanging around,
enjoying nature.

699
00:40:52,133 --> 00:40:54,363
Is everything all right?

700
00:40:54,568 --> 00:40:56,559
- Is she waiting for me?
- Who?

701
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:59,102
Rosinha, who else!

702
00:40:59,306 --> 00:41:01,240
You're the one who should know.

703
00:41:01,442 --> 00:41:03,706
Be straight with me!
What did she say?

704
00:41:03,911 --> 00:41:05,503
About what?

705
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,113
The gift! Tell me!
It’s driving me crazy!

706
00:41:08,315 --> 00:41:11,512
Oh, right!
She kept it.

707
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:15,052
- That’s it?
- What did you expect?

708
00:41:15,256 --> 00:41:19,158
- Did you want her to faint?
- She could at least have been glad!

709
00:41:19,426 --> 00:41:22,122
She was!
Who wouldn't be...

710
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:24,957
with a brooch
and a pair of earrings?

711
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:28,158
What pair of earrings?
I only sent a brooch!

712
00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:31,964
One brooch.
A smart lad sent two earrings...

713
00:41:32,173 --> 00:41:34,664
...one for each ear.
- Who was it?

714
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,070
And which gift did she like best?

715
00:41:37,311 --> 00:41:39,279
Which touched her the most?

716
00:41:39,513 --> 00:41:43,108
- Go on, tell me!
- She hasn't been touched yet...

717
00:41:43,317 --> 00:41:47,413
but I know she likes brave men.
She wants both to duel.

718
00:41:47,621 --> 00:41:50,556
- She'll take the winner.
- Who is the knave?

719
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:52,782
I'll eat his liver...

720
00:41:53,027 --> 00:41:55,495
...and rip his hearts out!
- He's only got one heart!

721
00:41:55,696 --> 00:41:57,721
Well, get him another!
I'll rip them both out!

722
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,696
Don't interrupt my anger
with your fuss!

723
00:42:00,901 --> 00:42:03,233
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

724
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:06,497
But I saw Chico earlier today,
on the Major's property.

725
00:42:06,707 --> 00:42:10,939
He said he'd be meeting you
after mass, at 7 p.m.

726
00:42:11,145 --> 00:42:13,670
- Chico?
- After mass, at 7 p.m.

727
00:42:13,881 --> 00:42:15,542
And what does he want?

728
00:42:15,749 --> 00:42:18,650
It’s about the earrings
you gave Ms. Rosinha.

729
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,984
Do you think that moron's
challenging me?

730
00:42:22,556 --> 00:42:25,753
He also spat when
he said your name.

731
00:42:26,227 --> 00:42:28,058
That kid wants to die...

732
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:30,456
and I want to kill him!
A perfect match!

733
00:42:30,664 --> 00:42:35,431
Ms. Rosinha loved the
brooch she got as a gift.

734
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:38,161
He had the nerve
to give her a brooch?

735
00:42:38,372 --> 00:42:41,364
Today I'm going
to have some fun!

736
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:47,907
It’s settled. At 7, after mass,
we'll chase them away.

737
00:42:48,115 --> 00:42:49,810
Did you forget
that I'm a sissy?

738
00:42:50,017 --> 00:42:52,986
- They're worse than you are!
- Are you trying to humiliate me?

739
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:56,321
No one's a bigger
sissy than I am!

740
00:42:56,523 --> 00:42:57,956
But Rosinha won't know that.

741
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:01,457
She's going to think
you're the devil incarnate!

742
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,130
I'm a sissy,
but I'm not stupid!

743
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,593
They're going to kill me!

744
00:43:05,799 --> 00:43:08,324
I'm saying it’ll be okay,
and you'll finally...

745
00:43:08,535 --> 00:43:10,799
have Rosinha's heart!

746
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,599
- How will it be okay?
- You'll see!

747
00:43:13,807 --> 00:43:16,742
- Dead men can't see!
- Just do as I say.

748
00:43:16,944 --> 00:43:20,436
Oh, Virgin Mary!
I'll either be dead or humiliated!

749
00:43:20,648 --> 00:43:23,344
Either way,
I'll lose Rosinha!

750
00:43:23,817 --> 00:43:25,614
May the punches
not hurt too much...

751
00:43:25,819 --> 00:43:28,845
may Vince's knife
be soft in my empty gut...

752
00:43:29,056 --> 00:43:32,753
and may the Corporal's
bullets kill me quickly!

753
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:40,188
But if Jack's plan works
and I get out of this alive...

754
00:43:40,401 --> 00:43:43,268
I promise never again...
Never again...

755
00:43:45,606 --> 00:43:47,665
to sleep with another
woman in my life!

756
00:43:47,908 --> 00:43:49,842
None...

757
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,803
but Rosinha.

758
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:56,175
- Will you walk with me, Chico?
- Is mass over?

759
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:59,045
You were praying so hard,
you didn't notice.

760
00:43:59,253 --> 00:44:00,914
I was praying to Our Lady.

761
00:44:01,121 --> 00:44:04,921
- What were you praying for?
- For a miracle, actually!

762
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:08,993
- I'll bet it was for love!
- I was praying not to die of it.

763
00:44:09,363 --> 00:44:11,558
Is your heart
beating that fast?

764
00:44:11,765 --> 00:44:15,462
- It’s popping out of my chest!
- The bullies are waiting for you.

765
00:44:15,669 --> 00:44:18,604
- What do they want?
- Didn't Chico tell you?

766
00:44:18,939 --> 00:44:23,239
- He's going to fight them.
- Chico, you don't have to do this!

767
00:44:23,444 --> 00:44:24,638
If you say so!

768
00:44:24,845 --> 00:44:27,405
No, Ms. Rosinha!
No friend of mine will be humiliated!

769
00:44:27,614 --> 00:44:30,708
- This is no game!
- You'll see!

770
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:33,910
He's quiet and rational
until he loses his temper.

771
00:44:34,121 --> 00:44:35,679
- Chico!
- Yes?

772
00:44:35,889 --> 00:44:38,949
Be careful not to
hurt them too bad.

773
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:42,322
Don't worry.
One shout from Chico will do!

774
00:44:49,536 --> 00:44:52,869
- Looking for me?
- I've found you already.

775
00:44:53,073 --> 00:44:55,041
Make your last wish.

776
00:44:55,242 --> 00:44:57,437
I'm dying to stick my knife
in your gut!

777
00:44:57,644 --> 00:44:59,976
- Am I interrupting?
- Feel free, Corporal.

778
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,648
Excuse me, Corporal.
He's a rascal.

779
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:04,078
Don't waste your time on him.

780
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:07,913
No Corporal for you, Vince.
Never mind my title today.

781
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,090
- I'm here as a civilian.
- Therefore...

782
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:15,227
you can't arrest me if
I finish off a rascal right here!

783
00:45:15,429 --> 00:45:19,195
But he has a tryst with me.
I'm going to deal with him.

784
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,334
What’s going on, Jack?

785
00:45:21,668 --> 00:45:24,660
- Chico has proposed a"truel".
- A "truel"?

786
00:45:24,872 --> 00:45:25,896
A three-way duel.

787
00:45:26,106 --> 00:45:28,540
Well, Chico, with whom
was your tryst?

788
00:45:28,742 --> 00:45:30,676
The tryst was with both...

789
00:45:30,878 --> 00:45:32,709
but only to give them
a message from Rosinha.

790
00:45:32,946 --> 00:45:35,881
She said she loved the gifts
you sent...

791
00:45:36,183 --> 00:45:39,914
and she'll wear the one
from the winner of a duel.

792
00:45:41,288 --> 00:45:43,688
Maybe we ought
to think it over.

793
00:45:43,891 --> 00:45:44,915
Are you afraid?

794
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:48,060
I'm not afraid!
Authorities are never afraid!

795
00:45:48,262 --> 00:45:49,752
Are you ready, Vince?

796
00:45:49,963 --> 00:45:51,988
Right now?
No, man!

797
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:54,292
- Ms. Rosinha will be scared.
- What do you mean?

798
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:57,368
She's dying to see a man
riddled with bullets...

799
00:45:57,571 --> 00:46:00,039
with his guts pouring out!

800
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,037
Oh, Lord!
What now?

801
00:46:02,242 --> 00:46:04,301
- Chico starts counting.
- One...

802
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:06,103
- They start walking.
- Two...

803
00:46:06,313 --> 00:46:08,144
At "go", they turn
and shoot at Chico.

804
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:11,511
- But he's unarmed!
- Guns are for sissies!

805
00:46:11,718 --> 00:46:13,743
- Three!
- Jesus!

806
00:46:14,555 --> 00:46:15,988
Go!

807
00:46:16,223 --> 00:46:18,521
- My Father Cicero!
- My Virgin Mary!

808
00:46:18,725 --> 00:46:21,319
Go away, you rascals!

809
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:22,722
Didn't I tell you?

810
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:25,660
They'd better not
play brave around me!

811
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,357
There!
They're gone!

812
00:46:32,439 --> 00:46:35,772
You'd better get ready
to honor your promise.

813
00:46:35,976 --> 00:46:37,739
Your prayers have been heard.

814
00:46:37,945 --> 00:46:40,004
It’ll be easy.

815
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:43,274
I promised to love only you
from then on.

816
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:57,754
Major, I'm sorry to bother you.
This is a friend of mine...

817
00:46:57,965 --> 00:46:59,159
from Serra Talhada.

818
00:46:59,366 --> 00:47:01,960
He's a candidate
to court Rosinha.

819
00:47:02,169 --> 00:47:05,263
He must own land or have
a college degree.

820
00:47:05,472 --> 00:47:07,406
He has both land and a degree.

821
00:47:07,608 --> 00:47:10,702
Why haven't you asked him in?

822
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,037
Nice to meet you, Mr...

823
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,873
- Chico.
- Chico what?

824
00:47:14,448 --> 00:47:16,507
Francisco Antonio Ronaldo
Ermenegildo de Aragao...

825
00:47:16,717 --> 00:47:18,082
Correia Vaz Pereira Goes.

826
00:47:18,285 --> 00:47:19,582
Chico is just a nickname.

827
00:47:19,786 --> 00:47:22,277
No wonder, with such a name!

828
00:47:22,489 --> 00:47:24,184
What is your property called?

829
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:28,258
- What property?
- You see, he's got quite a few.

830
00:47:28,462 --> 00:47:31,192
Dr. Chico, what about that
farm in Serra Talhada?

831
00:47:31,398 --> 00:47:34,526
- Farm in Serra Talhada?
- Farm in Serra Talhada!

832
00:47:34,735 --> 00:47:35,963
What a nice...

833
00:47:36,169 --> 00:47:37,966
simple name!

834
00:47:38,405 --> 00:47:41,602
Besides being a landowner,
you've got a degree?

835
00:47:41,808 --> 00:47:44,208
He's a lawyer!
Graduated in the capital.

836
00:47:44,411 --> 00:47:46,470
So you know all about laws.

837
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,875
Not everything, really, no.

838
00:47:49,082 --> 00:47:52,609
- He's modest.
- And you want to marry my daughter?

839
00:47:52,819 --> 00:47:54,650
Actually...

840
00:47:54,855 --> 00:47:58,518
He's so used to German that he
forgets how to speak "Brazilian"!

841
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,959
- Rosinha!
- Yes?

842
00:48:01,161 --> 00:48:03,459
Come and meet a suitor.

843
00:48:03,664 --> 00:48:05,723
- A suitor?
- He came as a candidate...

844
00:48:05,933 --> 00:48:07,958
...but I've promoted him.
- I like somebody else, father.

845
00:48:08,168 --> 00:48:09,226
Who let you?

846
00:48:09,436 --> 00:48:12,132
I didn't mean to,
but now, I can't help it.

847
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:15,099
- Who is he?
- He's poor, but brave and honest.

848
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,298
Mine wins!

849
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:18,137
He's rich, schooled,
and speaks German!

850
00:48:18,345 --> 00:48:20,472
- I can't tell my heart what to do!
- But I can.

851
00:48:20,681 --> 00:48:22,706
You have one week
to forget your boy!

852
00:48:22,916 --> 00:48:24,884
I'd rather die!

853
00:48:25,085 --> 00:48:27,144
But, if you insist...

854
00:48:27,354 --> 00:48:29,185
There.
She's been tamed.

855
00:48:29,423 --> 00:48:31,823
- We'll get married next week.
- So soon?

856
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:34,425
I have to obey you, Father!

857
00:48:35,429 --> 00:48:37,454
And I have to obey her.

858
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:40,462
And the Major will obey
his grandmother's wish...

859
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:44,228
and give Rosinha this
piggy bank as a wedding gift!

860
00:48:44,571 --> 00:48:46,801
- Good afternoon.
- We're screwed!

861
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,009
Speaking of a wedding,
here's the priest!

862
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:51,199
Whose wedding?

863
00:48:51,411 --> 00:48:53,606
I'd like you to meet
my future son-in-law.

864
00:48:55,082 --> 00:48:57,016
- Chico?
- Do you know him?

865
00:48:57,217 --> 00:49:00,209
Everybody does.
It’ll be the wedding of the year.

866
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,888
- The church will be renovated.
- It will?

867
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:05,388
- Don't you think it needs it?
- Certainly!

868
00:49:05,592 --> 00:49:08,925
The church is in such
a shabby state!

869
00:49:09,129 --> 00:49:14,089
Major Moraes wouldn't want bits
of it falling on the guests.

870
00:49:14,334 --> 00:49:17,394
- Absolutely not.
- It needs roofing, painting.

871
00:49:17,604 --> 00:49:20,505
Slow down, Father.
Congratulate Mr. Chico, first.

872
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:22,800
Congratulations!
Repair the altar...

873
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:25,945
polish the benches,
get a new bell.

874
00:49:26,146 --> 00:49:29,047
I think two hundred
crowns will do.

875
00:49:29,282 --> 00:49:31,409
Go ahead.
Mr. Chico will pay for it.

876
00:49:32,419 --> 00:49:36,014
- Two hundred crowns?
- He's not used to little money.

877
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:41,058
Two hundred! It’s what you gave
your servant to run an errand!

878
00:49:41,261 --> 00:49:42,353
Pocket change.

879
00:49:42,596 --> 00:49:46,032
I'll lend it to you, to give
the priest as an advance.

880
00:49:47,367 --> 00:49:50,165
To be on the safe side,
let’s get it on paper.

881
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:53,601
Go to town and get me a copy
of the deed to Dr. Chico's land...

882
00:49:53,807 --> 00:49:56,503
the farm of Serra Talhada...

883
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:58,837
so we can use it as
collateral for the loan.

884
00:49:59,046 --> 00:50:02,243
You sign this contract.
I get the land...

885
00:50:02,449 --> 00:50:05,043
if the debt is not paid.

886
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:06,879
Go on!
What are you waiting for?

887
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,350
Why the deed, Major?

888
00:50:09,556 --> 00:50:13,185
Dr. Chico will prove a man's word
is worth more than his fortune.

889
00:50:13,627 --> 00:50:15,959
He won't use
land as collateral.

890
00:50:16,229 --> 00:50:18,789
Write it down: You will
be paid within a week...

891
00:50:19,032 --> 00:50:22,365
or you can strip
the skin off his back.

892
00:50:22,569 --> 00:50:25,663
Now, that’s a brave man!

893
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,840
- Sign here.
- I can't!

894
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:33,340
He doesn't have his glasses.
Just stamp your finger.

895
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:37,807
You sign too, as a witness.

896
00:50:38,018 --> 00:50:41,977
- My, how important I am!
- My, how dead I'll be!

897
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:45,019
That’s how I like it.

898
00:50:45,225 --> 00:50:48,092
- My skin! I like it so much!
- Stop your whining!

899
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,729
- It’s my skin, and it’s all I have!
- Exactly!

900
00:50:50,931 --> 00:50:54,492
- What else could I have offered?
- Your tongue, so you'd shut up.

901
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:59,567
Fifty for the parish,
ten for the diocese.

902
00:50:59,773 --> 00:51:00,865
No way.

903
00:51:01,074 --> 00:51:04,669
Fifty for the diocese,
ten for the parish.

904
00:51:05,412 --> 00:51:09,007
As the Lord's delegates,
we must preach fairness.

905
00:51:09,349 --> 00:51:11,340
This isn't fair, Bishop.

906
00:51:11,551 --> 00:51:15,317
As the Lord's delegates,
we preach fairness...

907
00:51:15,522 --> 00:51:16,887
and humility.

908
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:19,923
Fairness, humility...

909
00:51:20,127 --> 00:51:23,927
...detachment from worldly goods.
- Fairness, humility...

910
00:51:24,131 --> 00:51:25,928
detachment from worldly goods...

911
00:51:26,133 --> 00:51:29,660
and obedience!
So do as I say!

912
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:30,992
I don't know, Chico.

913
00:51:31,204 --> 00:51:33,672
No matter how hard I squeeze,
I don't have a single idea!

914
00:51:33,874 --> 00:51:36,900
- It’s because you're hungry!
- That’s not it.

915
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:40,637
Hunger and trouble used
to make me think faster!

916
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:44,339
Where's Jack the Cricket,
the sharpest mind of all...

917
00:51:44,551 --> 00:51:46,712
the smartest and boldest,
even in his sleep?

918
00:51:46,953 --> 00:51:50,616
He's gone, Chico.
The well is dry.

919
00:51:50,824 --> 00:51:54,157
Not a single thought,
not a spark of an idea.

920
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:58,525
I'm surrounded by walls
in a room without a door.

921
00:51:58,732 --> 00:52:01,360
Skinny, poor, and,
to top it off, stupid!

922
00:52:01,568 --> 00:52:03,365
The only way out is death!

923
00:52:06,106 --> 00:52:08,973
Farewell... Chico!

924
00:52:09,609 --> 00:52:11,338
Never again...

925
00:52:12,312 --> 00:52:14,906
...will I eat manioc!
- No, this can't be!

926
00:52:15,115 --> 00:52:16,707
You can't die in
the middle of this story!

927
00:52:16,917 --> 00:52:18,680
Okay! I'm all better!

928
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:22,651
What a guy to die and
come back from the dead!

929
00:52:22,856 --> 00:52:26,053
Don't you get it? I just
came up with my great idea!

930
00:52:26,259 --> 00:52:29,057
Didn't you turn stupid
and die because of it?

931
00:52:29,262 --> 00:52:32,663
If people died of stupidity,
you'd be long gone.

932
00:52:32,866 --> 00:52:37,269
I stabbed this balloon full of
blood that was under my shirt.

933
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:40,405
I still haven't stopped shaking!

934
00:52:40,607 --> 00:52:41,904
That’s what you're going to do.

935
00:52:42,108 --> 00:52:44,838
You hide this bladder full
of blood under your shirt...

936
00:52:45,045 --> 00:52:48,037
pretend you're dead,
and then go off somewhere.

937
00:52:48,281 --> 00:52:51,944
Rosinha pretends she's mad
with grief and goes to meet you.

938
00:52:52,152 --> 00:52:53,710
Who would want to kill me?

939
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,014
A bandit. You die a hero,
defending the town.

940
00:52:57,224 --> 00:52:59,488
I want no dealings
with such people!

941
00:52:59,826 --> 00:53:02,795
I'll be the bandit,
you idiot!

942
00:53:02,996 --> 00:53:05,760
I'll come in disguise!

943
00:53:05,966 --> 00:53:07,900
Aren't you too skinny
for a bandit?

944
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:10,126
In fear, no one will notice.

945
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:13,767
- God, if I find a way out...
- Don't promise anything.

946
00:53:13,974 --> 00:53:15,407
I always pay the price!

947
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,770
So I'm in it all alone?

948
00:53:17,978 --> 00:53:20,970
Trust me.
Start bragging around.

949
00:53:21,181 --> 00:53:25,117
Tomorrow you're going
to face the king of bandits!

950
00:53:25,852 --> 00:53:28,946
It’s too slow around here!

951
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:32,254
My hand is itching
to hit someone!

952
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:35,257
You scared away the town
bullies just 3 days ago!

953
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,824
I'm dying to fight again.

954
00:53:38,064 --> 00:53:40,157
What fool would fight you?

955
00:53:40,367 --> 00:53:42,232
Bunch of sissies!

956
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:43,959
I've thought of
joining the police...

957
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:45,797
so I could kill
some bandits.

958
00:53:46,006 --> 00:53:47,769
Take it easy.

959
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:50,841
- It’s a war out there.
- That’s what I want.

960
00:53:51,044 --> 00:53:53,069
I want to hear the shots!

961
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,748
The women screaming!

962
00:53:56,182 --> 00:53:59,276
Bullets flying through the air!

963
00:54:02,389 --> 00:54:06,189
It’s all over!
The bandits are in town!

964
00:54:06,393 --> 00:54:08,793
- This will make my day!
- What about the police?

965
00:54:09,029 --> 00:54:11,497
- They ran away!
- They did?

966
00:54:11,698 --> 00:54:15,099
They heard that the bandits
were coming from the church...

967
00:54:15,302 --> 00:54:17,862
and took the opposite direction!

968
00:54:18,204 --> 00:54:20,365
I just got a sudden urge to pray.

969
00:54:20,573 --> 00:54:22,097
Watch out!
It’s dangerous!

970
00:54:22,309 --> 00:54:24,504
I'll show them a thing or two!

971
00:54:25,712 --> 00:54:27,873
I'll leave my weapons!

972
00:54:28,081 --> 00:54:30,572
My teeth will do just fine.

973
00:54:38,291 --> 00:54:40,919
Your blessing, father.
I'm here for a wedding.

974
00:54:41,127 --> 00:54:43,061
Where's the bride, son?

975
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:45,295
Right here.

976
00:54:46,132 --> 00:54:48,566
You're going to marry death.

977
00:54:49,336 --> 00:54:50,963
Who's he?
A canon?

978
00:54:51,271 --> 00:54:52,738
- A bishop.
- Good.

979
00:54:53,606 --> 00:54:56,837
I've never killed one before.
You'll be my first.

980
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:01,044
Get up! I have no
sympathy for your fits.

981
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,713
Your Grace will excuse me...

982
00:55:03,917 --> 00:55:05,145
but I have to check your pockets.

983
00:55:05,352 --> 00:55:09,311
I apologize for my poverty.
I can't help my friends out.

984
00:55:09,522 --> 00:55:13,549
Severino is poorer than you.
He's got no one.

985
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,422
Only this old gun.

986
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,860
Fifty crowns!

987
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:23,933
Could that be?

988
00:55:24,137 --> 00:55:27,197
Praying is a booming
business around here!

989
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:30,808
It was being put away
to remodel the diocese.

990
00:55:31,011 --> 00:55:34,845
Maybe the church
will also be renovated...

991
00:55:35,048 --> 00:55:37,414
and the father has something
for his friend Severino.

992
00:55:37,617 --> 00:55:40,780
Yes, I won't deny it.
Here you go, Mr. Severino.

993
00:55:40,987 --> 00:55:44,218
Five crowns.
That’s all I have on me.

994
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:47,086
Really?
Is it possible?

995
00:55:47,293 --> 00:55:51,320
If a bishop had 5O, a priest
should have 1O, at least.

996
00:55:53,133 --> 00:55:55,931
Look at that!
Just like I said.

997
00:55:56,136 --> 00:55:57,797
Ten crowns!

998
00:55:58,038 --> 00:56:01,337
I may even quit
my robbery enterprise...

999
00:56:01,541 --> 00:56:04,374
and get a job as a sacristan!

1000
00:56:09,816 --> 00:56:12,114
Whoever broke into the church...

1001
00:56:12,318 --> 00:56:14,149
come out, so I can trim
your horns, cuckold!

1002
00:56:14,354 --> 00:56:16,049
You're going to face a real man!

1003
00:56:16,256 --> 00:56:18,417
I like to do things right...

1004
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,525
from the inside out!

1005
00:56:20,727 --> 00:56:23,662
Those are two things
I didn't know.

1006
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:28,024
One: That I was a cuckold.

1007
00:56:28,234 --> 00:56:30,259
Two: That dead men could talk.

1008
00:56:31,538 --> 00:56:33,563
Oh, mother...

1009
00:56:34,707 --> 00:56:38,404
Were you challenging me,
you foolish rogue?

1010
00:56:38,611 --> 00:56:42,513
- Me? Challenging you?
- Answer me, instead of asking!

1011
00:56:43,249 --> 00:56:46,446
- Did you talk to me or not?
- It was a mistake, sir.

1012
00:56:46,686 --> 00:56:49,883
Had it not been a mistake,
I'd spare you for your bravery.

1013
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:53,457
But, since it was,
I'll kill you with the others!

1014
00:56:58,364 --> 00:57:00,355
- Excuse me.
- Come on in.

1015
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,025
My house is your house.

1016
00:57:03,236 --> 00:57:06,171
- And I'm all yours!
- Show me your left hand.

1017
00:57:06,706 --> 00:57:09,072
- With pleasure.
- Is that a wedding ring?

1018
00:57:09,275 --> 00:57:12,244
Yes.
I married a wimp.

1019
00:57:12,445 --> 00:57:15,778
But I regret it.
I like only brave men.

1020
00:57:16,549 --> 00:57:18,676
I'm ashamed of this one.

1021
00:57:18,885 --> 00:57:20,318
Ashamed?

1022
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,250
You, a married woman,
should be ashamed...

1023
00:57:23,456 --> 00:57:25,151
of offering yourself
to another man.

1024
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:28,885
Do you know what I usually
do with such women?

1025
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,160
No.

1026
00:57:32,565 --> 00:57:35,193
I mark them on the chin.

1027
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:39,004
And is the bakery doing well?

1028
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:40,638
No.
I make very little.

1029
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:43,238
There's nothing in here.
Look around.

1030
00:57:43,443 --> 00:57:45,570
I trust you!

1031
00:57:45,778 --> 00:57:48,440
You left what you had
in the safe at the bakery.

1032
00:57:48,648 --> 00:57:51,344
I took it all when I passed by.

1033
00:57:57,824 --> 00:57:59,849
One...

1034
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:01,856
two...

1035
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,528
three...

1036
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,095
four...

1037
00:58:05,365 --> 00:58:06,855
five.

1038
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:09,762
- Who's going first?
- Ladies first!

1039
00:58:09,969 --> 00:58:12,164
No way!
There's only one lady!

1040
00:58:12,372 --> 00:58:15,170
- It should be by age.
- The oldest go first.

1041
00:58:15,375 --> 00:58:18,208
- The youngest go first.
- Get ready to die!

1042
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:22,711
- Severino of Aracaju has arrived!
- Are there two of him?

1043
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:25,942
- Lf he's you, who are you?
- I'm me!

1044
00:58:26,152 --> 00:58:29,849
- But if you're you, who's he?
- We'll find out soon enough.

1045
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:32,215
Who is this donkey pole?

1046
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:35,417
- Who?
- You, saying you're me.

1047
00:58:35,628 --> 00:58:39,325
- No bother, I'm leaving!
- Hold it right there...

1048
00:58:39,532 --> 00:58:40,829
you skinny little wimp!

1049
00:58:41,067 --> 00:58:43,900
- What’s going on?
- It’s a mirage. You see two...

1050
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:45,536
but there's only one!

1051
00:58:45,738 --> 00:58:47,729
Him!
Excuse me.

1052
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:51,240
- Hold it, scoundrel!
- It’s late. I have things to do.

1053
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:54,311
I bid you all farewell,
and have a safe trip.

1054
00:58:54,514 --> 00:58:58,780
Not a chance!
You'll stay and die with the others.

1055
00:58:58,985 --> 00:59:01,681
Let’s begin with the baker.

1056
00:59:01,921 --> 00:59:03,513
Let’s do it!

1057
00:59:03,723 --> 00:59:08,990
He'll have the honor of dying
with his unfaithful wife.

1058
00:59:09,195 --> 00:59:13,461
Go outside. Severino doesn't
kill anyone in a church.

1059
00:59:13,666 --> 00:59:15,793
I don't like to kill women...

1060
00:59:16,002 --> 00:59:18,596
...but if I have to...
- Let go off me.

1061
00:59:18,871 --> 00:59:22,272
I have more guts than
most bastards around.

1062
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:24,670
See?
Hold on to me.

1063
00:59:24,877 --> 00:59:27,004
And, now, it’s the...

1064
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:31,074
The Bishop's turn.

1065
00:59:31,284 --> 00:59:34,583
- Can't you take care of him first?
- No, it’s your turn!

1066
00:59:34,787 --> 00:59:37,517
Okay, fine, you'll go together.

1067
00:59:37,724 --> 00:59:40,158
But he gets the first shot.

1068
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:44,795
Be a man, Bishop!
Set an example for the priest.

1069
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:47,796
He's scared to death.
Take them both!

1070
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:50,162
It’s bad luck enough to
kill 1, let alone 2 priests.

1071
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:56,267
Don't chicken out! And the two
of you, keep your legs steady!

1072
00:59:56,476 --> 01:00:00,037
What a shame!
You take away all joy of killing!

1073
01:00:01,414 --> 01:00:04,781
Well, what are Your
Lordship's names?

1074
01:00:06,552 --> 01:00:08,986
Mine is Chico,
if it pleases you.

1075
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:11,213
My Lordship
is named nothing!

1076
01:00:11,424 --> 01:00:13,722
Poor men have
nothing but misery!

1077
01:00:15,428 --> 01:00:17,896
So, what is Your
Miserability's name?

1078
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:19,789
Jack the Cricket.

1079
01:00:20,266 --> 01:00:22,826
Very well.

1080
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:26,164
It’s time for His Miserability,
Jack the Cricket...

1081
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:30,240
the most cowardly rascal
I've ever had the honor to kill!

1082
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:33,979
Hold it. I want to do you
a favor before dying.

1083
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:36,580
- What’s that?
- Give you this harmonica.

1084
01:00:36,783 --> 01:00:38,410
A harmonica?

1085
01:00:38,618 --> 01:00:40,245
What do I need that for?

1086
01:00:40,453 --> 01:00:43,980
- Not ever die from guns shots!
- What a lie!

1087
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:46,852
I've heard of blessed bells
that cure snakebite...

1088
01:00:47,093 --> 01:00:49,459
but a harmonica
that heals wounds?

1089
01:00:49,662 --> 01:00:50,959
It does!

1090
01:00:51,164 --> 01:00:53,758
Father Cicero blessed it
shortly before his death!

1091
01:00:53,966 --> 01:00:56,833
- I must see it to believe it.
- Fine.

1092
01:00:57,270 --> 01:01:00,398
- Please, give me your dagger.
- Watch it!

1093
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,073
Don't worry.

1094
01:01:02,275 --> 01:01:04,971
If I try anything against you,
shoot me.

1095
01:01:05,178 --> 01:01:07,840
Keep your gun on him.
He's the kind I'm afraid of.

1096
01:01:08,481 --> 01:01:12,110
- What now?
- I'll stab Chico in the belly.

1097
01:01:12,352 --> 01:01:13,614
Not me!

1098
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:15,515
Don't chicken out!

1099
01:01:15,722 --> 01:01:18,919
I'll play the harmonica,
and you'll come back to life.

1100
01:01:19,125 --> 01:01:22,060
- The balloon! The balloon!
- No, thank you, Jack!

1101
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:24,923
I told you,
I'll play the harmonica!

1102
01:01:25,131 --> 01:01:27,497
So you get stabbed and
I'll play the harmonica!

1103
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:31,136
Man, you know what?
That’s enough talk.

1104
01:01:31,337 --> 01:01:33,134
Take this!

1105
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:35,763
The balloon!

1106
01:01:35,975 --> 01:01:38,535
Drop dead, bastard!

1107
01:01:38,878 --> 01:01:41,438
- See the blood?
- Yes.

1108
01:01:41,647 --> 01:01:45,515
I never doubted
you'd stab him.

1109
01:01:45,718 --> 01:01:48,949
- I want to see you heal him.
- I'll get to it!

1110
01:02:19,585 --> 01:02:24,488
Virgin Mary! Father Cicero
must have blessed it!

1111
01:02:29,562 --> 01:02:32,087
- Don't you feel anything?
- Not a thing.

1112
01:02:32,298 --> 01:02:33,765
- And before?
- Before, when?

1113
01:02:33,966 --> 01:02:36,594
- Before he played it?
- I was dead.

1114
01:02:36,803 --> 01:02:38,930
- Dead?
- Absolutely.

1115
01:02:40,106 --> 01:02:42,540
I saw Our Lady and
Father Cicero in heaven.

1116
01:02:42,742 --> 01:02:44,232
But how, in such
a short time?

1117
01:02:44,444 --> 01:02:46,309
I don't know, but I did.

1118
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:48,139
What did Father Cicero say?

1119
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:49,473
He said...

1120
01:02:49,715 --> 01:02:55,244
"Give Severino this harmonica
I blessed before I died.

1121
01:02:55,455 --> 01:02:57,320
He needs it more than you do."

1122
01:02:57,557 --> 01:02:58,990
My God!

1123
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:01,251
Only Father Cicero
would have said that!

1124
01:03:01,461 --> 01:03:03,691
With a harmonica that "unkills",
I'll like killing!

1125
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:06,256
Jack, give it to me.

1126
01:03:06,466 --> 01:03:07,831
If you let me and Chico go.

1127
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,023
I can't.

1128
01:03:09,235 --> 01:03:11,726
I killed the baker, his wife,
the Bishop, and the priest.

1129
01:03:11,938 --> 01:03:13,929
They are waiting for you.

1130
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:18,167
If I spare you, they'll haunt me,
because I'll have been unfair.

1131
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:21,608
I gave you the chance
to meet Father Cicero!

1132
01:03:21,814 --> 01:03:23,645
Is this how you thank me?

1133
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:26,580
Meet the Father?
I was never so luck.

1134
01:03:26,786 --> 01:03:28,515
Now you can meet him.

1135
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:31,087
- How?
- Your man shoots you...

1136
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:34,191
you visit Father Cicero,
I play and you return!

1137
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:37,726
- What if you don't play?
- I wouldn't do that to you.

1138
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:40,490
- I'll play, it’s a promise.
- All right, but give it to him...

1139
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:43,191
to be on the safe side.

1140
01:03:43,436 --> 01:03:46,030
- I get shot and go see the Father?
- Yes.

1141
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,298
- Right, Chico?
- Yes, absolutely!

1142
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:52,142
He's right there, dressed in blue,
surrounded by angels.

1143
01:03:52,345 --> 01:03:54,779
He said: "Tell Severino
I want to see him!"

1144
01:03:54,981 --> 01:03:56,278
I'm going!

1145
01:03:56,482 --> 01:03:57,779
- Shoot!
- But captain...

1146
01:03:58,217 --> 01:03:59,741
Shoot, I'm telling you!

1147
01:03:59,952 --> 01:04:02,477
Run off!
The police are coming!

1148
01:04:02,688 --> 01:04:05,714
- Shoot!
- Just do it, once and for all!

1149
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:08,359
I don't like it, but if I must...

1150
01:04:08,561 --> 01:04:09,960
Wait!

1151
01:04:10,363 --> 01:04:13,821
- Don't forget the harmonica.
- Don't worry, captain!

1152
01:04:16,035 --> 01:04:17,559
So shoot!

1153
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:23,298
The police are coming!

1154
01:04:28,314 --> 01:04:31,681
- Captain?
- Leave him a little longer!

1155
01:04:32,685 --> 01:04:34,880
Come on, captain!

1156
01:04:35,087 --> 01:04:36,452
Captain!

1157
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:41,386
Damn you! You killed the captain,
didn't you?

1158
01:04:41,594 --> 01:04:43,653
Do you want some killing?

1159
01:04:44,096 --> 01:04:46,189
Take this, bunch of monkeys!

1160
01:04:48,401 --> 01:04:51,268
- Come on, Jack!
- I'm taking the money with me!

1161
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:53,335
Run, Jack!

1162
01:04:53,573 --> 01:04:57,600
Bastard! For once in my life,
I'll enjoy killing someone!

1163
01:05:12,692 --> 01:05:14,353
Jack!

1164
01:05:15,795 --> 01:05:18,662
Jack! Jack!
Are you going to die?

1165
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:20,964
I think I am, Chico.

1166
01:05:23,135 --> 01:05:24,693
Things are blurry.

1167
01:05:25,271 --> 01:05:28,001
Poor Jack's going to die.

1168
01:05:28,207 --> 01:05:30,539
Quit the whining, Chico.

1169
01:05:30,743 --> 01:05:33,371
You've seen a man die before.

1170
01:05:33,613 --> 01:05:36,673
The only thing I regret
is not getting the money...

1171
01:05:36,882 --> 01:05:39,817
I'd get when
you marry Rosinha.

1172
01:05:48,327 --> 01:05:50,386
Jack...

1173
01:05:50,596 --> 01:05:52,564
Jack!

1174
01:05:52,765 --> 01:05:54,289
Jack!

1175
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:57,492
Jack!

1176
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:01,196
Oh, God!

1177
01:06:02,108 --> 01:06:05,077
Poor Jack the Cricket’s dead!

1178
01:06:06,512 --> 01:06:10,414
What a bastard,
to die like this!

1179
01:06:12,785 --> 01:06:14,912
What am I going to
do without Jack?

1180
01:06:15,121 --> 01:06:18,181
What am I going to do
without Jack?

1181
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:20,950
Jack! Jack!

1182
01:06:24,563 --> 01:06:26,861
There's no undoing this.

1183
01:06:28,434 --> 01:06:30,925
Jack the Cricket is dead.

1184
01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:47,911
The world's smartest
Cricket is gone.

1185
01:06:51,123 --> 01:06:53,614
He fulfilled his fate...

1186
01:06:54,126 --> 01:06:57,527
met the irreparable doom...

1187
01:06:57,730 --> 01:07:01,689
which marks our strange
destiny on this Earth...

1188
01:07:01,901 --> 01:07:04,699
the unexplainable fact...

1189
01:07:04,904 --> 01:07:09,238
which puts all living things in one
flock of condemned creatures...

1190
01:07:10,042 --> 01:07:12,408
because all that lives...

1191
01:07:13,846 --> 01:07:15,711
shall die.

1192
01:07:30,663 --> 01:07:36,363
<i>Hail</i>,<i>Mary</i>

1193
01:07:36,602 --> 01:07:41,869
<i>Hail</i>,<i>hail</i>

1194
01:07:42,074 --> 01:07:47,307
<i>Hail</i>,<i>Mary</i>

1195
01:07:47,546 --> 01:07:52,984
<i>Make your penitence</i>

1196
01:07:53,219 --> 01:07:57,815
<i>For all your sins</i>

1197
01:07:58,224 --> 01:08:03,560
<i>And tell Our Lady</i>

1198
01:08:03,763 --> 01:08:09,633
<i>To came and embrace you</i>

1199
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:13,034
Jack, you rotten bastard!

1200
01:08:13,239 --> 01:08:15,400
I don't believe it!

1201
01:08:15,608 --> 01:08:18,008
Not even here
you get off my back?

1202
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:20,770
I've looked around,
but I haven't seen Father Cicero.

1203
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:24,746
- He's got many people to see!
- You're right.

1204
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:27,009
- It’s crowded in here!
- And there are more coming.

1205
01:08:27,219 --> 01:08:29,881
Look at the four you dispatched.

1206
01:08:32,691 --> 01:08:35,785
There must be a special
place for the clergy.

1207
01:08:35,995 --> 01:08:38,691
By the way,
why aren't you down there?

1208
01:08:38,898 --> 01:08:42,766
- I'm dead, like you.
- I'm no man to die!

1209
01:08:42,968 --> 01:08:46,199
- Remember the harmonica?
- I do.

1210
01:08:46,639 --> 01:08:51,269
Why doesn't my man play it,
so I can go back?

1211
01:08:51,477 --> 01:08:53,001
Old fool!

1212
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:55,339
Do you think a harmonica
can make you live?

1213
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:57,607
Watch your mouth or I kill you!

1214
01:08:57,850 --> 01:09:00,216
How?
I'm already dead!

1215
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:07,018
He's not the only one!
I'll kill anyone who laughs!

1216
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:11,492
- We meant no offense.
- But you didn't die alone.

1217
01:09:11,697 --> 01:09:14,427
- We've all died.
- As Chico used to say...

1218
01:09:14,633 --> 01:09:18,364
"we fulfilled our fates and
met the irreparable doom."

1219
01:09:18,704 --> 01:09:21,434
- Where's Chico?
- He escaped.

1220
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:24,438
He's alive, the rascal!
Hell of a guy!

1221
01:09:24,643 --> 01:09:27,339
- He was the only one!
- As he used to say...

1222
01:09:27,546 --> 01:09:31,073
It’s the first time I hear
the dead quote the living!

1223
01:09:31,283 --> 01:09:33,581
You'll pay me for this
harmonica trick, you bastard!

1224
01:09:33,786 --> 01:09:35,617
Bastard my butt!

1225
01:09:35,855 --> 01:09:38,415
I'm already dead!
I won't listen to this!

1226
01:09:38,624 --> 01:09:40,683
There's no rich or poor,
brave or cowardly.

1227
01:09:40,893 --> 01:09:42,986
We're all equals before God...

1228
01:09:43,195 --> 01:09:45,095
Or the devil!

1229
01:09:48,734 --> 01:09:51,567
Why are you all so surprised?

1230
01:09:54,506 --> 01:09:56,269
The door!

1231
01:09:57,643 --> 01:10:01,579
Am I a monster,
by any chance?

1232
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:06,581
Not at all!
Your elegance impresses us!

1233
01:10:06,886 --> 01:10:10,549
- You look like a movie star.
- Do you think so?

1234
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:12,689
- I do.
- Then I do too.

1235
01:10:12,892 --> 01:10:17,022
Has anyone ever told you
you're much nicer in person?

1236
01:10:17,229 --> 01:10:21,063
And I don't usually like
people at first glance.

1237
01:10:21,267 --> 01:10:25,397
See? The devil isn't
as ugly as they say.

1238
01:10:27,706 --> 01:10:31,005
Okay, but this smell of sulfur...

1239
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:35,780
Is my smell bothering you?

1240
01:10:36,048 --> 01:10:37,879
Oh, no, no.

1241
01:10:38,117 --> 01:10:39,914
It’s quite nice!

1242
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:42,677
I'm about to faint
because of the smell!

1243
01:10:43,355 --> 01:10:47,121
Watch it!
Be respectful.

1244
01:10:47,359 --> 01:10:48,553
Please!

1245
01:10:48,794 --> 01:10:51,456
- We mean no disrespect!
- I'll let it pass for this time.

1246
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:54,292
You should thank God
the devil's a nice guy.

1247
01:10:54,533 --> 01:10:55,693
- Lf I were him...
- lf I were him...

1248
01:10:55,901 --> 01:11:00,361
I'd wash real hard
to get rid of this stench!

1249
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:05,909
You're going to pay
for everything you did!

1250
01:11:06,111 --> 01:11:07,544
I love a tough man!

1251
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:10,943
I'm going to send you all to hell!

1252
01:11:13,285 --> 01:11:15,253
We're screwed!

1253
01:11:16,855 --> 01:11:18,686
See what you've done?

1254
01:11:18,958 --> 01:11:21,256
I wanted him to show us
his true face!

1255
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:27,622
Now, we know who
we're talking to!

1256
01:11:29,301 --> 01:11:32,600
I'm sending you all
to the eternal fire...

1257
01:11:32,805 --> 01:11:35,467
to suffer with me!

1258
01:11:35,975 --> 01:11:38,671
You think we'll go,
just because you said so?

1259
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:43,337
That’s right,
and there's no way out!

1260
01:11:52,458 --> 01:11:55,518
What a hell of court is this,
with no right to an appeal?

1261
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:58,196
A person has to be heard...

1262
01:11:58,397 --> 01:12:02,800
...before he's convicted!
- Nonsense, foolishness!

1263
01:12:03,002 --> 01:12:04,594
It may be so...

1264
01:12:04,803 --> 01:12:06,794
but I appeal
to the Mighty One!

1265
01:12:07,006 --> 01:12:09,975
Help me, My Lord
Jesus Christ!

1266
01:12:28,093 --> 01:12:30,561
Who is it?
Emmanuel?

1267
01:12:30,929 --> 01:12:35,025
Yes, it’s Emmanuel, the Lion
of Judah, the son of David.

1268
01:12:35,234 --> 01:12:38,726
Come all, for you shall be tried.

1269
01:12:43,675 --> 01:12:46,508
I mean no disrespect
to such an important person...

1270
01:12:46,712 --> 01:12:49,806
but that guy just
called you Emmanuel.

1271
01:12:50,015 --> 01:12:52,483
That’s right, Jack.
That’s one of my names.

1272
01:12:52,684 --> 01:12:55,619
But you can also call me
Jesus, Lord, God.

1273
01:12:55,821 --> 01:12:58,415
Hold on a minute!
Are you Jesus?

1274
01:12:58,624 --> 01:12:59,716
Yes, why?

1275
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:03,189
Because... No disrespect...

1276
01:13:03,395 --> 01:13:06,262
but I didn't think you'd be
so brown!

1277
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:08,490
- Hush!
- You hush.

1278
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:12,033
You were more astounded
than him, but didn't show it...

1279
01:13:12,237 --> 01:13:13,761
out of worldly arrogance.

1280
01:13:13,972 --> 01:13:17,066
- The time of falsehood is over.
- Well said!

1281
01:13:17,276 --> 01:13:20,211
The color may not be the best,
but you're very good with words!

1282
01:13:20,412 --> 01:13:22,607
Thank you, Jack.

1283
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:26,581
But you yourself are
prejudiced towards race.

1284
01:13:26,785 --> 01:13:30,915
I came like this on purpose.
I knew I'd get a reaction.

1285
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:35,017
And you, quit imitating my looks!

1286
01:13:35,294 --> 01:13:38,786
You know you're not equal to God.

1287
01:13:39,031 --> 01:13:41,090
Big deal!

1288
01:13:42,367 --> 01:13:45,359
- Face me.
- I'm fine the way I am.

1289
01:13:45,571 --> 01:13:48,734
As you wish.
Make your report...

1290
01:13:48,941 --> 01:13:51,307
starting with the Bishop.

1291
01:13:51,643 --> 01:13:57,081
Simony. He approved the
funeral of a bitch in Latin...

1292
01:13:57,282 --> 01:13:59,682
because the owner
paid him 1OO crowns.

1293
01:13:59,918 --> 01:14:02,853
- Is that forbidden?
- I don't know...

1294
01:14:03,155 --> 01:14:06,181
but you thought it was...

1295
01:14:06,391 --> 01:14:09,622
and then, suddenly,
you changed your mind.

1296
01:14:09,828 --> 01:14:11,193
And there's more!

1297
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:16,065
Deceit.
Disdain towards the poor.

1298
01:14:16,268 --> 01:14:18,429
Submission to the powerful!

1299
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:22,333
And all of the above
can go for the priest!

1300
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:26,204
But I didn't falsely quote
canonic law, like he did.

1301
01:14:26,411 --> 01:14:30,939
But you are being
unsympathetic towards him!

1302
01:14:31,150 --> 01:14:34,051
Will my deeds here count?

1303
01:14:34,253 --> 01:14:37,745
No, the devil is just confused.

1304
01:14:37,956 --> 01:14:39,856
- What about the baker?
- He and his wife...

1305
01:14:40,092 --> 01:14:43,289
...were the worst masters in town.
- It’s a lie!

1306
01:14:43,495 --> 01:14:46,396
No, it isn't! It’s true!
I was sick...

1307
01:14:46,598 --> 01:14:51,399
"For 3 days without a single
glass of water." I know, Jack.

1308
01:14:51,603 --> 01:14:56,540
Everybody's heard this story
several times.

1309
01:14:57,576 --> 01:15:00,136
But I couldn't take it!

1310
01:15:00,345 --> 01:15:03,109
Steak for the bitch,
starvation for Jack?

1311
01:15:03,315 --> 01:15:05,977
- It was too much!
- The husband, a tightwad.

1312
01:15:06,185 --> 01:15:08,244
The wife, an adulteress.

1313
01:15:08,453 --> 01:15:13,049
If you place it on a scale,
they were both terrible.

1314
01:15:13,292 --> 01:15:16,455
- Accuse Severino.
- Do I have to?

1315
01:15:17,229 --> 01:15:19,595
He killed more than 3O people!

1316
01:15:19,798 --> 01:15:22,494
This devil is everything
I've always hated...

1317
01:15:22,701 --> 01:15:25,226
a DA, a sacristan,
a dog, and a policeman.

1318
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:27,572
You're being funny, now...

1319
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:32,437
but Emmanuel is fair. Things
look good for me, not for you.

1320
01:15:32,678 --> 01:15:37,775
That’s true. Things look bad.
The charges are serious.

1321
01:15:38,383 --> 01:15:40,908
What amuses me the most...

1322
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:45,112
is seeing this coward
shaking with fear.

1323
01:15:46,558 --> 01:15:50,119
I can't help it! If I could
stop shaking, I'd defend myself!

1324
01:15:50,329 --> 01:15:52,297
Stop!

1325
01:15:52,497 --> 01:15:55,261
What a relief!
I was getting tired.

1326
01:15:55,467 --> 01:15:57,935
- What was that?
- One of the devil's tricks.

1327
01:15:58,136 --> 01:16:00,866
He likes playing games.

1328
01:16:01,073 --> 01:16:03,633
It could only have been
that mischief-maker!

1329
01:16:03,875 --> 01:16:06,275
What do you say
in your defense?

1330
01:16:06,478 --> 01:16:10,642
I know you're clever, but
you know you've been accused.

1331
01:16:10,849 --> 01:16:13,545
Actually, I haven't
been accused of anything!

1332
01:16:13,752 --> 01:16:15,652
- No?
- No, he hasn't!

1333
01:16:15,854 --> 01:16:18,755
He made such a fuss that
I forgot to accuse him.

1334
01:16:18,957 --> 01:16:21,983
But I'll get you now,
you rascal.

1335
01:16:22,461 --> 01:16:26,227
He plotted the
bitch's funeral...

1336
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:29,634
inciting simony.

1337
01:16:30,435 --> 01:16:35,964
He encouraged Chico
to be with a married woman...

1338
01:16:36,174 --> 01:16:40,838
inciting concupiscence.

1339
01:16:41,046 --> 01:16:44,277
He devised Severino's death...

1340
01:16:46,051 --> 01:16:49,418
premeditated murder!

1341
01:16:51,723 --> 01:16:55,989
Jack, it seems
you overdid it.

1342
01:16:56,194 --> 01:16:59,027
His case is hopeless...

1343
01:17:00,465 --> 01:17:02,865
so I'll take him first.

1344
01:17:03,068 --> 01:17:04,729
I haven't given up!

1345
01:17:05,003 --> 01:17:06,971
I may go, but not that easily!

1346
01:17:07,205 --> 01:17:10,038
- I will appeal!
- To whom, Jack?

1347
01:17:10,242 --> 01:17:14,269
Even the Lord said
the charges are serious.

1348
01:17:14,479 --> 01:17:16,310
Wait.

1349
01:17:16,815 --> 01:17:20,216
- To whom will you appeal?
- To someone closer to us.

1350
01:17:20,419 --> 01:17:22,683
- Someone who watches us.
- A saint?

1351
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:27,052
I may look stupid, but I'm not.
I have a higher card.

1352
01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:28,417
Who's that?

1353
01:17:28,627 --> 01:17:31,027
"Our Lady, save us all
Hear us when we call

1354
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:33,288
Milk from the gentle cow
From the stubborn, not now

1355
01:17:33,498 --> 01:17:35,796
The gentle one has calmed down
The stubborn one put her foot down

1356
01:17:36,001 --> 01:17:38,162
I was once a brand new boat
The finest ship afloat

1357
01:17:38,370 --> 01:17:40,395
I've been a boy and man
I haven't been a woman yet

1358
01:17:40,605 --> 01:17:43,699
Aid me Our Lady
Mother of God of Nazareth!"

1359
01:17:58,023 --> 01:18:00,116
Here comes the Compassionate.

1360
01:18:00,325 --> 01:18:02,725
Women meddle in everything!

1361
01:18:03,161 --> 01:18:06,324
You did call me,
didn't you, Jack?

1362
01:18:06,531 --> 01:18:10,592
- Did my verse anger you?
- No, Jack.

1363
01:18:10,802 --> 01:18:12,736
Why would I be?

1364
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:15,702
They were funny,
and that is good.

1365
01:18:16,475 --> 01:18:19,103
It’s the devil
who likes gloom.

1366
01:18:19,311 --> 01:18:22,474
- I object!
- I know you do, but I'm sorry.

1367
01:18:22,681 --> 01:18:24,512
I can't go against My Mother.

1368
01:18:24,716 --> 01:18:28,015
I just love her habit
of saving everyone!

1369
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:29,983
It demoralizes everything.

1370
01:18:30,188 --> 01:18:32,748
- That’s because you had no mother!
- That’s right!

1371
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:35,722
Such a mean fellow must’ve
come from an incubator!

1372
01:18:36,728 --> 01:18:38,389
Why did you call me?

1373
01:18:38,597 --> 01:18:41,122
This son of an incubator
wants to take us to hell.

1374
01:18:41,333 --> 01:18:43,198
I had to appeal to you.

1375
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:45,630
I'll see what I can do.

1376
01:18:47,672 --> 01:18:50,869
I plea for these poor souls...

1377
01:18:51,109 --> 01:18:53,339
for they have no one.

1378
01:18:54,246 --> 01:18:55,508
Don't condemn them.

1379
01:18:55,714 --> 01:18:58,706
- I appeal to justice!
- And I, to mercy.

1380
01:18:58,917 --> 01:19:03,115
We must consider the poor
and sad condition of man.

1381
01:19:03,321 --> 01:19:06,290
It all starts with fear.

1382
01:19:06,491 --> 01:19:10,222
Because of it, men commit
evil deeds, almost unwittingly.

1383
01:19:11,196 --> 01:19:14,597
- It’s fear.
- What do they fear?

1384
01:19:15,534 --> 01:19:17,365
They fear many things...

1385
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:20,399
suffering...

1386
01:19:21,606 --> 01:19:23,665
Ioneliness...

1387
01:19:23,875 --> 01:19:28,107
and, above all,
they fear death.

1388
01:19:28,814 --> 01:19:31,942
And you tell me that?

1389
01:19:32,150 --> 01:19:35,085
I, who died alone, abandoned...

1390
01:19:37,656 --> 01:19:40,250
even by My Father.

1391
01:19:40,459 --> 01:19:43,690
Don't forget the night
you spent in the garden...

1392
01:19:44,062 --> 01:19:46,997
the fear you underwent.

1393
01:19:47,432 --> 01:19:49,366
Poor man!

1394
01:19:49,701 --> 01:19:53,535
Made of flesh and blood,
like any other man.

1395
01:19:53,738 --> 01:19:59,267
Like all men, you were left
alone to die and to suffer.

1396
01:19:59,478 --> 01:20:04,677
Everybody fears death, but that
doesn't make them righteous.

1397
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:10,082
How did this fear make the baker
and his wife better people?

1398
01:20:10,288 --> 01:20:14,554
Fear of death alone
does not redeem sins.

1399
01:20:14,759 --> 01:20:17,853
But it may,
at the time of death.

1400
01:20:18,763 --> 01:20:24,827
In the Hail Mary, I am asked to
pray for men when they die.

1401
01:20:25,971 --> 01:20:27,836
I do.

1402
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:31,607
And I look unto them at this hour.

1403
01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:35,041
Often, it is when they die...

1404
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:39,513
that they finally find what they'd
been looking for all their lives.

1405
01:20:40,285 --> 01:20:42,913
That’s what happened
to Eurico and Dora...

1406
01:20:43,121 --> 01:20:45,749
when they were about to be shot.

1407
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:54,532
Stand here.
I'll shoot from the church.

1408
01:20:54,799 --> 01:20:56,323
You'll have time
for a Hail Mary.

1409
01:20:56,535 --> 01:21:00,198
I'll pray too,
and she'll hear us.

1410
01:21:01,973 --> 01:21:05,409
We always think we can
live a little longer.

1411
01:21:08,346 --> 01:21:10,678
I like living...

1412
01:21:11,783 --> 01:21:16,413
but I've always asked myself if
I wanted to live longer than you.

1413
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:20,322
Now, I know.

1414
01:21:20,525 --> 01:21:23,358
I couldn't stand to see you die.

1415
01:21:26,498 --> 01:21:30,093
- I want to die first, Eurico!
- Oh, Dora!

1416
01:21:31,836 --> 01:21:33,827
Why did you cheat on me
all this time?

1417
01:21:37,475 --> 01:21:40,273
That was the reason...

1418
01:21:40,478 --> 01:21:44,175
It was like killing you
in my heart little by little.

1419
01:21:44,416 --> 01:21:48,409
I was so afraid of losing you,
I wanted it to happen slowly!

1420
01:21:49,054 --> 01:21:53,320
Don't worry.
Now, we'll be together forever.

1421
01:21:55,527 --> 01:21:58,792
Hey, mister,
we have one last wish.

1422
01:22:02,734 --> 01:22:05,703
- We want to die together.
- Good, it’ll save me a bullet...

1423
01:22:05,904 --> 01:22:07,838
but it’s one less for my record.

1424
01:22:16,815 --> 01:22:19,477
I claim, in their favor...

1425
01:22:19,684 --> 01:22:22,619
the husband's forgiveness
at the time of their death...

1426
01:22:23,154 --> 01:22:26,715
when he put his arms around her,
so they could die together.

1427
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:33,893
He was the greatest
victim of her actions...

1428
01:22:34,099 --> 01:22:36,897
and, yet, he prayed for her.

1429
01:22:37,102 --> 01:22:41,505
I note your plea. What about
the Bishop and the priest?

1430
01:22:41,706 --> 01:22:44,971
They also had their revelation
at the time of death.

1431
01:22:49,247 --> 01:22:51,715
It’s bad luck to kill a priest.

1432
01:22:52,017 --> 01:22:55,282
- Especially for the priest!
- Before I shoot...

1433
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:57,784
I want your absolution.

1434
01:22:57,989 --> 01:23:02,426
To be forgiven,
you must repent first...

1435
01:23:02,627 --> 01:23:04,026
and you can't kill us.

1436
01:23:04,262 --> 01:23:07,823
- I'll repent later!
- Then go repent in hell!

1437
01:23:08,166 --> 01:23:12,626
Even if I go to hell,
I have to obey the captain.

1438
01:23:12,837 --> 01:23:15,397
We can't deny absolution.

1439
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:18,632
We can't bless a killer...

1440
01:23:18,843 --> 01:23:20,834
especially ours!

1441
01:23:21,046 --> 01:23:23,640
We're priests, Your Grace.

1442
01:23:23,848 --> 01:23:28,911
Our mission is to save souls,
even if we can't save our own.

1443
01:23:30,822 --> 01:23:35,589
Remember Jesus' plea
for His executioners!

1444
01:23:35,794 --> 01:23:40,163
Forgive them, Father!

1445
01:23:40,365 --> 01:23:43,391
They don't know
what they're doing!

1446
01:24:03,621 --> 01:24:05,418
My God...

1447
01:24:05,957 --> 01:24:08,255
why have you abandoned us?

1448
01:24:11,896 --> 01:24:14,729
They followed your example...

1449
01:24:14,933 --> 01:24:17,697
...and forgave their killers.
- It’s always like that!

1450
01:24:17,902 --> 01:24:21,133
Everyone's good
after they're dead!

1451
01:24:22,073 --> 01:24:25,474
- As for Severino...
- Leave him to me.

1452
01:24:25,677 --> 01:24:28,578
He was redeemed
by his parents' death.

1453
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:32,773
When he was 8, he faced the beast
that lives in every man.

1454
01:24:45,263 --> 01:24:47,629
I wasn't killed by chance...

1455
01:24:47,832 --> 01:24:49,800
and spent my life
challenging death.

1456
01:24:50,034 --> 01:24:53,401
He went crazy when the
police killed his family.

1457
01:24:53,605 --> 01:24:56,802
He was not responsible
for his actions.

1458
01:24:57,008 --> 01:25:00,034
- He's saved.
- This is an outrage, and I...

1459
01:25:00,278 --> 01:25:03,213
You object, I know.

1460
01:25:03,414 --> 01:25:06,850
But your objection is overruled.
You don't understand a thing...

1461
01:25:07,051 --> 01:25:09,042
about God's ways.

1462
01:25:10,155 --> 01:25:11,486
Severino is saved.

1463
01:25:11,723 --> 01:25:15,454
He was a mere instrument
of God's wrath.

1464
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:18,925
Severino, my son,
you can go that way.

1465
01:25:27,272 --> 01:25:29,206
What about us?

1466
01:25:30,408 --> 01:25:35,209
Make up your mind!
This anxiety is worse than anything!

1467
01:25:35,446 --> 01:25:38,609
Don't say that. You don't know
what it’s like down there.

1468
01:25:38,817 --> 01:25:41,547
Any anxiety is better than that.

1469
01:25:41,753 --> 01:25:46,690
But I can't wait here forever!

1470
01:25:48,326 --> 01:25:51,955
After all,
what’ll the sentence be?

1471
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:56,564
Excuse me, Lord.

1472
01:25:57,168 --> 01:25:59,398
- May I say something?
- Yes, Jack.

1473
01:25:59,604 --> 01:26:03,096
Are there four
vacancies in purgatory?

1474
01:26:03,441 --> 01:26:06,103
- Yes.
- So put these four in there!

1475
01:26:06,477 --> 01:26:08,468
What do you say, Mother?

1476
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:11,740
I'd be very pleased.

1477
01:26:11,983 --> 01:26:14,349
It’s granted.

1478
01:26:15,253 --> 01:26:17,915
The four of you may go.

1479
01:26:18,857 --> 01:26:20,518
There's no hope!

1480
01:26:20,725 --> 01:26:22,920
It’s always like that when
a woman rules over a man!

1481
01:26:23,127 --> 01:26:24,788
Your turn, Jack the Cricket.

1482
01:26:24,996 --> 01:26:27,692
I'll make a point of
sending this one to hell!

1483
01:26:27,932 --> 01:26:30,560
You're so smart...

1484
01:26:30,768 --> 01:26:32,531
what do you have to say
for yourself?

1485
01:26:32,737 --> 01:26:35,069
- Nothing.
- What do you mean?

1486
01:26:35,273 --> 01:26:38,436
- Now is the time for truth.
- That’s the problem.

1487
01:26:38,643 --> 01:26:42,272
- I'm better skilled with lies.
- I'm glad you admit it!

1488
01:26:45,083 --> 01:26:48,780
- You lied to survive, Jack.
- But I enjoyed it.

1489
01:26:48,987 --> 01:26:51,080
I learned to enjoy
tricking those people!

1490
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:52,449
You were exploited!

1491
01:26:52,657 --> 01:26:55,490
Cleverness is a poor
man's courage!

1492
01:26:55,693 --> 01:26:59,288
It was your only weapon
against your heartless masters!

1493
01:26:59,497 --> 01:27:03,490
I thank you.
But I know I was no saint.

1494
01:27:03,701 --> 01:27:08,468
He's playing dumb
to get her sympathy.

1495
01:27:08,806 --> 01:27:11,104
I'm such a rotten apple
that he could be right.

1496
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:12,674
No! Don't give in!

1497
01:27:12,877 --> 01:27:15,471
He's the father of all lies!
He's trying to confuse you!

1498
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:20,915
The truth is I was no saint,
nor did I have a heroic death.

1499
01:27:21,719 --> 01:27:24,688
He was poor like us, my son.

1500
01:27:24,889 --> 01:27:29,622
He had to endure difficulties
in a poor, dry land, like ours.

1501
01:27:29,827 --> 01:27:32,557
He's struggled since he was a boy.

1502
01:27:32,764 --> 01:27:35,096
He had no childhood.

1503
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:39,168
He got used to little
bread and a lot of sweat.

1504
01:27:40,638 --> 01:27:43,539
In the drought, he'd eat plants...

1505
01:27:43,741 --> 01:27:46,301
and drank cactus water.

1506
01:27:47,512 --> 01:27:49,639
He starved.

1507
01:27:50,815 --> 01:27:53,875
When he couldn't bear it,
he prayed.

1508
01:27:54,252 --> 01:27:58,450
When prayers were no good,
he'd join the migrants...

1509
01:27:58,656 --> 01:28:01,056
who headed to the coast
in search of survival.

1510
01:28:01,259 --> 01:28:02,954
He was humiliated.

1511
01:28:04,095 --> 01:28:05,824
Defeated.

1512
01:28:06,731 --> 01:28:08,756
Homesick.

1513
01:28:10,068 --> 01:28:14,562
Whenever he heard news of rain,
he would go back...

1514
01:28:14,772 --> 01:28:16,535
in hopes again...

1515
01:28:16,741 --> 01:28:20,541
as if hope was a plant
that grows in the rain.

1516
01:28:21,045 --> 01:28:24,242
At the very sight of his
hometown, he felt grateful...

1517
01:28:24,449 --> 01:28:26,610
for being a poor...

1518
01:28:26,818 --> 01:28:29,582
dry land man,
but a brave and a believer.

1519
01:28:31,422 --> 01:28:34,084
I ask you, simply,
do not condemn him.

1520
01:28:35,660 --> 01:28:37,958
It’s a hard decision.

1521
01:28:38,162 --> 01:28:42,258
I realize what he's been through,
but there's a limit.

1522
01:28:42,834 --> 01:28:45,496
I am afraid I can't save him.

1523
01:28:46,704 --> 01:28:49,901
Then, give him another
chance, my son.

1524
01:28:50,341 --> 01:28:52,775
- How?
- Let Jack go back.

1525
01:28:54,278 --> 01:28:56,838
- Would that make you happy?
- Plenty!

1526
01:28:57,281 --> 01:29:00,409
It’s even better! I'll be more
careful and, next time I die...

1527
01:29:00,618 --> 01:29:03,109
I'll skip purgatory,
to baffle the devil!

1528
01:29:03,354 --> 01:29:06,255
- So, are you pleased, Jack?
- I am...

1529
01:29:06,457 --> 01:29:09,426
but this son of an incubator
will be mad!

1530
01:29:21,139 --> 01:29:23,107
What was that?

1531
01:29:23,307 --> 01:29:26,276
In his anger, he looked
at you and saw me.

1532
01:29:28,146 --> 01:29:32,276
- So, am I free to return?
- Yes, Jack. God be with you.

1533
01:29:32,483 --> 01:29:36,044
God and Our Lady,
who came to my rescue.

1534
01:29:36,254 --> 01:29:37,983
So long...

1535
01:29:38,689 --> 01:29:40,554
great lawyer and advocate.

1536
01:29:40,758 --> 01:29:43,420
Don't give up on me.
I want to straighten up...

1537
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:46,756
...but you know the flesh is weak!
- So long, Jack.

1538
01:29:49,033 --> 01:29:50,728
Thank you, Lord.

1539
01:29:52,203 --> 01:29:54,763
- So long!
- So long, Jack.

1540
01:29:54,972 --> 01:29:56,837
- Jack!
- Yes, Lord?

1541
01:29:57,041 --> 01:29:59,635
Behave yourself.

1542
01:30:00,411 --> 01:30:02,572
Yes, My Lord.

1543
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:07,114
Mother, if you go on interfering
in everyone's favor...

1544
01:30:07,318 --> 01:30:10,310
hell's going to be like
a government agency...

1545
01:30:10,521 --> 01:30:12,921
it exists,
but it doesn't work.

1546
01:30:27,872 --> 01:30:31,273
There's Chico
burying the dead guy.

1547
01:30:31,509 --> 01:30:34,034
What am I doing up here?

1548
01:30:34,245 --> 01:30:37,578
What am I doing down there?

1549
01:30:45,223 --> 01:30:49,626
To think Jack couldn't even
be buried in the cemetery.

1550
01:30:49,961 --> 01:30:53,920
He's worse off than
the baker's bitch!

1551
01:30:54,132 --> 01:30:58,159
Lord's Prayer, Our Lady, hail,
Mary, look at this repentant soul!

1552
01:30:58,369 --> 01:31:00,200
God! It’s Jack.

1553
01:31:01,706 --> 01:31:05,267
Jack, tell me what thou want!

1554
01:31:05,476 --> 01:31:09,003
Art thou in Heaven,
hell, or purgatory?

1555
01:31:09,213 --> 01:31:12,273
Look at him, talking to the dead.

1556
01:31:12,483 --> 01:31:16,283
"Jack, tell me
where thou art..."

1557
01:31:16,487 --> 01:31:19,012
Shame on you, Chico!
I'm alive.

1558
01:31:19,457 --> 01:31:23,484
It’s an evil ghost,
the kind that says it’s alive!

1559
01:31:23,694 --> 01:31:26,561
Get up, it’s me!
I'm alive!

1560
01:31:26,764 --> 01:31:29,028
- Is it possible?
- Well, here I am.

1561
01:31:29,233 --> 01:31:31,997
- I don't believe it!
- Then, look!

1562
01:31:36,874 --> 01:31:39,468
What’s wrong?
Isn't seeing believing?

1563
01:31:39,677 --> 01:31:41,338
You weren't
supposed to show me!

1564
01:31:41,546 --> 01:31:43,070
What now, Chico?

1565
01:31:43,281 --> 01:31:45,841
I won't believe it,
you won't show me!

1566
01:31:46,050 --> 01:31:48,712
What about our partnership,
our old friendship?

1567
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,649
- Are they finished?
- They're already over!

1568
01:31:50,855 --> 01:31:53,517
I won't be partners
with a dead man!

1569
01:31:53,724 --> 01:31:55,589
But I am alive!

1570
01:31:55,993 --> 01:31:58,621
See for yourself.
Touch my arm.

1571
01:31:58,963 --> 01:32:00,954
Be brave, man, touch it!

1572
01:32:08,472 --> 01:32:10,337
It’s true, Jack!

1573
01:32:12,910 --> 01:32:14,537
- How was that?
- I don't know.

1574
01:32:14,745 --> 01:32:16,076
I think the bullet just nicked me.

1575
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:19,738
Things went black
and now I am here.

1576
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:22,613
- Damn good news!
- I've got some bad news.

1577
01:32:22,820 --> 01:32:25,050
- What?
- I lost the money I had.

1578
01:32:25,623 --> 01:32:26,851
Don't worry!

1579
01:32:27,058 --> 01:32:28,616
I took it from you
before the burial.

1580
01:32:28,826 --> 01:32:31,989
Scoundrel! Cried for me
but never forgot the money.

1581
01:32:32,230 --> 01:32:35,563
That’s right. The money
was there, you were dead...

1582
01:32:35,766 --> 01:32:36,926
so I decided to keep it.

1583
01:32:37,134 --> 01:32:40,001
Well done.
I would do the same.

1584
01:32:40,571 --> 01:32:43,870
- So, we're rich.
- Filthy rich.

1585
01:32:44,075 --> 01:32:47,272
I got money from the priest,
the Bishop, and Severino.

1586
01:32:47,478 --> 01:32:49,605
- Let’s buy the bakery!
- Good idea!

1587
01:32:49,814 --> 01:32:50,940
"Miramar Bakery.

1588
01:32:51,148 --> 01:32:53,241
Cricket & Chico Inc."

1589
01:32:53,451 --> 01:32:55,681
- How does it sound?
- Beautiful!

1590
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:59,783
Oh, God and Our Lady!
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

1591
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:01,822
What is it?
You're the stupid one!

1592
01:33:02,026 --> 01:33:04,893
That’s right, I am!
The stupidest guy on Earth!

1593
01:33:05,096 --> 01:33:08,327
- Oh, my God!
- What’s up?

1594
01:33:08,532 --> 01:33:12,161
Poor us! We were rich a minute ago!
Now, we're poor again!

1595
01:33:12,703 --> 01:33:16,332
- Don't tell me you lost the money!
- No, it’s right here.

1596
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:18,741
Oh, my God!

1597
01:33:18,943 --> 01:33:23,312
- And why are you moaning?
- I thought you were dead.

1598
01:33:23,514 --> 01:33:24,674
So?

1599
01:33:24,882 --> 01:33:29,148
So I promised all the money
to Our Lady, if you lived.

1600
01:33:29,387 --> 01:33:32,652
Oh, my God!
Oh, Our Lady!

1601
01:33:32,857 --> 01:33:34,722
Oh, my God!
Oh, Our Lady!

1602
01:33:34,925 --> 01:33:37,792
How could you make
such a promise?

1603
01:33:37,995 --> 01:33:41,931
How could I know you'd live?
You're so hard to kill!

1604
01:33:42,133 --> 01:33:44,328
Damned promise!

1605
01:33:44,535 --> 01:33:47,993
- What a stupid promise!
- It’s too late now!

1606
01:33:48,205 --> 01:33:51,504
- Didn't you promise just half?
- No, I promised it all.

1607
01:33:51,942 --> 01:33:54,274
Damned promise!

1608
01:33:54,478 --> 01:33:56,241
What a stupid promise!

1609
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:59,210
Quit whining over and over!

1610
01:33:59,417 --> 01:34:01,442
Let’s just pay what we owe!

1611
01:34:01,652 --> 01:34:03,552
Not "we".
You go!

1612
01:34:03,788 --> 01:34:05,722
I made no promise
and half the money is mine!

1613
01:34:05,923 --> 01:34:08,790
But it was mine,
as I was your only heir.

1614
01:34:08,993 --> 01:34:11,359
I don't care!
I didn't promise anything!

1615
01:34:11,562 --> 01:34:16,295
Then it’s up to you!
I'm going to do what I have to do.

1616
01:34:29,613 --> 01:34:31,342
Chico!

1617
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:34,180
- What?
- Wait. I'm coming with you.

1618
01:34:35,586 --> 01:34:37,213
Yes.

1619
01:34:39,557 --> 01:34:41,855
You convinced me.

1620
01:34:42,059 --> 01:34:43,856
There was no one
to convince me.

1621
01:34:44,061 --> 01:34:45,961
With a different saint, we
could've worked something out.

1622
01:34:46,163 --> 01:34:48,996
But a promise to Our Lady...

1623
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:50,792
Maybe that’s why I lived.

1624
01:34:51,001 --> 01:34:53,595
- So, you'll give the money?
- Yes.

1625
01:34:53,804 --> 01:34:55,795
In person.

1626
01:34:56,340 --> 01:34:57,773
Oh, God and Our Lady!

1627
01:34:58,008 --> 01:34:59,737
You sound as a
scratched record!

1628
01:34:59,944 --> 01:35:02,742
With this whole mess,
I forgot the Major's money!

1629
01:35:02,947 --> 01:35:04,812
You promise too much money!

1630
01:35:05,015 --> 01:35:06,915
You made me do it!

1631
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:10,576
And gave my skin as collateral!

1632
01:35:10,821 --> 01:35:12,982
Oh, Virgin Mary!

1633
01:35:13,190 --> 01:35:15,351
And now all the money
goes to the saint!

1634
01:35:15,593 --> 01:35:19,290
- Let’s make it half?
- No way. You said all of it.

1635
01:35:21,132 --> 01:35:24,624
Damn promise!
What a stupid promise!

1636
01:35:24,935 --> 01:35:28,530
Quit beating around the bush.
You have the money or not?

1637
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:30,433
I do!

1638
01:35:30,674 --> 01:35:32,232
I mean, I did!

1639
01:35:33,077 --> 01:35:35,477
I'll let you prove you're a man
and you like my daughter.

1640
01:35:35,746 --> 01:35:38,180
Will you marry her
and honor our deal...

1641
01:35:38,382 --> 01:35:41,715
or would you rather call
the whole thing off?

1642
01:35:41,986 --> 01:35:44,580
He won't call it off!
He loves me!

1643
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:49,391
- Take your pick, boy.
- You can set the date, father.

1644
01:35:49,693 --> 01:35:53,220
- I haven't picked yet.
- I trust you.

1645
01:35:53,697 --> 01:35:57,064
- We'll be married tomorrow.
- That’s when I'll skin your back!

1646
01:35:57,301 --> 01:36:00,134
You know what?
I'd love to marry you, Rosinha...

1647
01:36:00,337 --> 01:36:03,272
but the truth is
that I'm a coward.

1648
01:36:03,474 --> 01:36:06,034
- That I knew!
- You do? How?

1649
01:36:06,243 --> 01:36:07,938
I found out long ago.

1650
01:36:08,212 --> 01:36:11,443
But it was too late,
I was dying to marry you!

1651
01:36:11,649 --> 01:36:14,083
- Who says I have the guts?
- The pig.

1652
01:36:14,351 --> 01:36:16,319
- The pig?
- The piggy bank!

1653
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:21,253
- What piggy bank?
- Rosinha's wedding present!

1654
01:36:21,459 --> 01:36:23,017
What’s it got to do
with my skin?

1655
01:36:23,227 --> 01:36:27,095
We get married, you get the pig,
and pay your debt!

1656
01:36:27,298 --> 01:36:31,860
Chico, you found a mate for love,
and I, for my wits!

1657
01:36:49,053 --> 01:36:51,886
If you want to call it off,
I'll take her home.

1658
01:36:52,089 --> 01:36:55,252
Not for all the skin
on my body, Major!

1659
01:36:55,459 --> 01:36:59,896
- Let alone a little strip.
- I'll make a belt with it.

1660
01:37:00,431 --> 01:37:02,763
You may not be brave...

1661
01:37:02,967 --> 01:37:05,197
but you sure fake it well!

1662
01:37:05,436 --> 01:37:09,133
It’s the pig giving me courage.

1663
01:37:11,475 --> 01:37:15,411
- Don't forget, half is mine!
- What a hell of a money is this?

1664
01:37:15,613 --> 01:37:17,240
It’s age-old money!

1665
01:37:17,448 --> 01:37:21,248
Jesus Christ!
This money is out of circulation!

1666
01:37:21,452 --> 01:37:25,149
- It isn't worth a cent today.
- I should've known!

1667
01:37:25,356 --> 01:37:29,053
The coins have been here
for over 5O years!

1668
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:32,320
- I'm so stupid! Stupid!
- I'm even more stupid.

1669
01:37:32,530 --> 01:37:36,091
I'm tired of this little
"rich and poor" game!

1670
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:40,634
And I'm tired of not knowing
whether I'll lose my skin or not!

1671
01:37:41,805 --> 01:37:45,138
I know you're having fun, but
it’s time to honor our agreement.

1672
01:37:45,342 --> 01:37:47,833
- It’s early.
- Don't worry.

1673
01:37:48,045 --> 01:37:50,775
The knife is sharp.

1674
01:37:50,981 --> 01:37:53,142
Is there anesthesia?

1675
01:37:53,350 --> 01:37:54,874
Hold it, father!

1676
01:37:55,352 --> 01:37:59,721
- What was the agreement?
- 2OO crowns or a strip of skin.

1677
01:37:59,990 --> 01:38:04,290
- 2OO crowns or his skin?
- Yes.

1678
01:38:04,662 --> 01:38:07,597
- His skin?
- Yes, his skin!

1679
01:38:07,831 --> 01:38:09,731
- Just skin?
- You think it’s nothing?

1680
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,059
It is something,
but not that much.

1681
01:38:12,269 --> 01:38:13,793
It’s just a strip.

1682
01:38:16,206 --> 01:38:19,437
Only skin, not a drip of blood.
It wasn't in the deal.

1683
01:38:19,810 --> 01:38:23,712
- What?
- The contract says skin.

1684
01:38:23,914 --> 01:38:27,145
- There's no mention of blood.
- I hadn't thought of that.

1685
01:38:27,418 --> 01:38:30,717
It’s either skin off,
with no bloodshed, or nothing.

1686
01:38:30,921 --> 01:38:33,617
I should cut your throat, rascal!

1687
01:38:33,824 --> 01:38:37,453
But I won't do it!
The worst punishment for her...

1688
01:38:37,661 --> 01:38:40,892
is to be married
to someone like you!

1689
01:38:41,098 --> 01:38:42,588
A coward, a sissy...

1690
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:45,234
...a rascal!
- You're being kind!

1691
01:38:46,236 --> 01:38:49,728
Get lost!
You and your generations to come!

1692
01:38:49,940 --> 01:38:52,932
It will be a cold day in hell...

1693
01:38:53,143 --> 01:38:58,103
before I leave you
a penny, Rosinha!

1694
01:38:58,816 --> 01:39:00,374
We're all broke again!

1695
01:39:00,584 --> 01:39:02,950
Again?
It’s my first time, actually.

1696
01:39:03,153 --> 01:39:05,747
Yes, dear, "some" gold digger,
you are the opposite of money.

1697
01:39:05,956 --> 01:39:08,083
I wonder if this isn't
for the best.

1698
01:39:08,292 --> 01:39:10,817
If I got rich, I might
end up like the baker.

1699
01:39:11,028 --> 01:39:13,087
Plus, we're used to poverty.

1700
01:39:13,297 --> 01:39:16,494
- I'm getting hungry as hell.
- Here's a piece of our cake!

1701
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:19,760
You are a quick learner
in poverty, Rosinha!

1702
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:24,068
Please, help me.
I'm starving.

1703
01:39:24,308 --> 01:39:27,334
Forgive us, but we're
all starving, too.

1704
01:39:27,745 --> 01:39:29,975
Take this, sir.

1705
01:39:30,381 --> 01:39:33,248
- And may God be with you.
- May He be with you.

1706
01:39:33,450 --> 01:39:35,884
You gave him almost everything.

1707
01:39:36,086 --> 01:39:37,713
He's also God's creature.

1708
01:39:37,921 --> 01:39:40,515
Sometimes,
Jesus comes in disguise...

1709
01:39:40,724 --> 01:39:42,123
to test our kindness.

1710
01:39:42,326 --> 01:39:44,521
That could be,
but that one wasn't Him.

1711
01:39:44,728 --> 01:39:49,222
- How do you know?
- Jesus? As black as that guy?

1712
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:52,833
Why not?
I met a man who met Jesus.

1713
01:39:53,103 --> 01:39:55,663
- Where, Chico?
- In Heaven.

1714
01:39:58,142 --> 01:40:01,077
He said there are
huge processions there.

1715
01:40:01,278 --> 01:40:04,873
He said Jesus was on His throne,
surrounded by angels...

1716
01:40:05,082 --> 01:40:06,310
like in paintings.

1717
01:40:06,850 --> 01:40:09,785
He said Paradise is near Bahia,
that’s why Christ is dusky.

1718
01:40:10,020 --> 01:40:12,511
How could he tell you that,
if he was dead?

1719
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:15,115
I don't know, but so it was!

1720
01:43:54,244 --> 01:43:57,941
