1
00:03:34,295 --> 00:03:38,050
Mod f-x-square, d-x.

2
00:03:39,927 --> 00:03:43,472
So please finish Percival
for next time.

3
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:48,895
I know many of you had this as
undergraduates, but it won't hurt to brush up.

4
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,526
Thank you, Steven.

5
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:59,448
I also put an advanced Fourier system
on the main hallway chalkboard.

6
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:02,326
I'm hoping that one of you might
prove it by the end of the semester.

7
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,372
Now the person to do so will
not only be in my good graces...

8
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:08,542
but also go on
to fame and fortune...

9
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,712
by having their accomplishment
recorded and their name printed...

10
00:04:11,795 --> 00:04:13,839
in the auspicious M.I.T. Tech.

11
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:18,428
Former winners include Nobel laureates,
Field's medal winners...

12
00:04:18,511 --> 00:04:23,224
renowned astrophysicists
and lowly M.I.T. Professors.

13
00:04:23,308 --> 00:04:26,687
Well, that's all.
If you have any questions...

14
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,232
I'm sure that Tom
has the answers.

15
00:05:05,396 --> 00:05:07,649
Hi, Will.

16
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:09,734
- Kirsten, how you doing?
- I'm all right. How are you?

17
00:05:09,817 --> 00:05:12,987
- Good.
- I didn't get on Cathy last night.

18
00:05:13,071 --> 00:05:14,280
- No?
- No.

19
00:05:14,322 --> 00:05:15,824
- Why not?
- I don't know.

20
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:18,160
- Cathy!
- What?

21
00:05:18,244 --> 00:05:20,704
Why didn't you give me none of that
nasty little hoochie-woochie...

22
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:23,123
- you usually throw at me?
- Oh, fuck you...

23
00:05:23,165 --> 00:05:25,585
and your Irish curse,
Chuckie.

24
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:29,589
Like I'd waste my energy spreadin'
my legs for that Tootsie Roll dick?

25
00:05:29,673 --> 00:05:33,051
- Go home and give it a tug yourself.
- Tootsie Roll!

26
00:05:33,134 --> 00:05:35,137
T- Toots!

27
00:05:35,179 --> 00:05:38,474
She's missin' a tooth,
Will.

28
00:05:38,516 --> 00:05:41,519
She's got skin problems.
I don't-

29
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:44,647
Plus, it's like 5-to-2 Morgan ends up
marryin' her, you know what I mean?

30
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,317
There's only so many times you can
bang your friend's future wife.

31
00:05:47,401 --> 00:05:49,987
It's wrong.
Where you goin'?

32
00:05:50,028 --> 00:05:54,533
- I'm gonna take off.
- Fuck you, you're takin' off. It's, like, what, 10:00?

33
00:05:54,616 --> 00:05:56,828
No, I'm tired.

34
00:05:59,163 --> 00:06:01,082
Irish curse?

35
00:06:01,165 --> 00:06:04,043
She don't know.
There ain't no Irish curse.

36
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,329
Out! Stop
pressuring me back.

37
00:07:14,412 --> 00:07:18,584
Stop crowding the plate!
Which one will it be?

38
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,297
You're gonna get charged,
you know that?

39
00:07:23,381 --> 00:07:26,885
You think I'm afraid of you, you big
fuck? You're crowdin' the fuckin' plate.

40
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:31,515
Hey, uh, Casey's bouncin' up a bar at
Harvard next week. We should go up there.

41
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:33,767
- What are we gonna do up there?
- I don't know.

42
00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:37,855
We'll fuck up some smart kids.
Probably fit right in.

43
00:07:39,732 --> 00:07:42,443
Ow! Fuckin' punk.

44
00:07:42,485 --> 00:07:46,782
- Oh, what's up? You still tough?
- Come on!

45
00:07:46,865 --> 00:07:48,701
Come on. Come on.
That's it.

46
00:07:59,296 --> 00:08:01,214
- Professor Lambeau?
- Yes?

47
00:08:01,298 --> 00:08:04,676
I'm in your applied theories class. We're
all up at the math and science building.

48
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:08,931
Come here. It's Saturday.

49
00:08:09,015 --> 00:08:12,435
- Unless you wanna have a drink with me tonight.
- Maybe.

50
00:08:12,518 --> 00:08:14,562
We just couldn't wait
until Monday to find out.

51
00:08:14,645 --> 00:08:18,317
- Find out what?
- Who proved the theorem.

52
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:44,150
This is correct.
Who did this?

53
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:46,528
- Jack?
- It wasn't me.

54
00:08:46,612 --> 00:08:49,323
- Nemesh?
- N-No way.

55
00:08:53,368 --> 00:08:56,164
- Come on, Joey, now!
- Billy, McNamara's up.

56
00:08:56,205 --> 00:08:58,666
Come on, kid!

57
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,919
- Joey, dig it out! Dig it out!
- Son of a bitch!

58
00:09:01,002 --> 00:09:04,547
Bring it down, Mac! That's how to
do it! Attaboy! Take two, Mac.

59
00:09:07,384 --> 00:09:12,097
Hey, Morgan, who's the girl with the
striped pants? She's got a nice ass.

60
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:15,185
Yeah, that's a real nice ass.
- Who's the guy she's with?

61
00:09:15,227 --> 00:09:18,521
That fuckin' guinea. I hate that
little bitch. Will knows him.

62
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:21,233
Yeah, I do.
Yeah, fuckin' Carmine Scarpaglia.

63
00:09:21,316 --> 00:09:24,236
- That guy used to beat the shit out of me in kindergarten.
- That guy?

64
00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:26,530
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

65
00:09:26,614 --> 00:09:29,200
Fuck this.
Let's get some food.

66
00:09:29,242 --> 00:09:33,412
- Oh, what, Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
- Fuck her.

67
00:09:33,496 --> 00:09:35,916
- I could go for a Whopper.
- Let's go to Kelly's.

68
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:39,044
Morgan, I'm not goin' to Kelly's just
'cause you like the take-out girl.

69
00:09:39,127 --> 00:09:43,423
- It's 15 minutes out of our way.
- What the fuck are we gonna do? We can't spare 15 minutes?

70
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:46,834
Double burger.

71
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:47,804
Double burger.

72
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,391
Double burger.

73
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:54,435
Chuck, I had
a double burger.

74
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:57,648
Would you shut the fuck up!
I know what you ordered. I was there.

75
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:00,734
- So give me my fuckin' sandwich.
- What do you mean, your sandwich? I bought it.

76
00:10:00,818 --> 00:10:02,611
Morgan, how much money
you got on you?

77
00:10:02,695 --> 00:10:05,448
I said I'd get change
when I get the snow cone.

78
00:10:05,532 --> 00:10:08,994
I said that when we pulled up. Give me
my sandwich and stop bein' a prick.

79
00:10:09,077 --> 00:10:12,163
All right, well, give me your fuckin'
16 cents that you got on you now.

80
00:10:12,247 --> 00:10:16,627
We'll put your fuckin' sandwich on layaway.
Here we go. Keep it right up here for ya.

81
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:19,338
We'll put you on a program. Every day
you come in here with your six cents.

82
00:10:19,422 --> 00:10:22,592
- At the end of the week, you get your sandwich.
- Are you gonna be an asshole?

83
00:10:22,675 --> 00:10:26,930
What am I, fuckin' sandwich welfare? I think
you should establish a good line of credit.

84
00:10:26,972 --> 00:10:29,766
Like how you bought
your couch- payment plans.

85
00:10:29,808 --> 00:10:33,103
Remember how your mother brought in
ten dollars every day for a year.

86
00:10:33,145 --> 00:10:35,106
She finally got her couch
Rent-A-Center style.

87
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:38,443
- Can I have my food, please?
- Here's your fuckin' double burger.

88
00:10:40,194 --> 00:10:42,655
- Whoa!
- Hey, hold up, Chuck.

89
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:45,117
- Slow it down.
- Who do we got?

90
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:47,119
- I don't know yet.
- Hey, douche bag!

91
00:10:47,161 --> 00:10:49,705
Yeah, you, you skank face!

92
00:10:49,788 --> 00:10:54,293
- Shut the fuck up. - Get outta
here. - What are you worried about?

93
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,296
Why don't you lick
my love stick?

94
00:10:56,338 --> 00:11:01,384
We seen the guy 15 minutes ago. We should've
fight him then. We're eatin' our snacks now.

95
00:11:01,468 --> 00:11:03,511
- Shut up, Morgan, you're goin'.
- I'm not goin'. - So don't go.

96
00:11:03,595 --> 00:11:07,391
- I'm not goin'.
- Fuckin' go, Morgan.

97
00:11:07,475 --> 00:11:09,936
Let me tell you somethin'. If you're not
out there in two fuckin' seconds,

98
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,854
when I'm done with them,
you're next.

99
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:16,026
Carmine, it's me, Will. Remember,
we went to kindergarten together.

100
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:33,836
- Fuckin', let's go, man.
- Step on his fuckin' head.

101
00:11:33,878 --> 00:11:37,841
Get his ass on the ground.
Stop that motherfucker.

102
00:11:44,306 --> 00:11:46,184
Motherfucker, die!

103
00:11:46,226 --> 00:11:49,563
- Carter!
- Come on!

104
00:12:00,241 --> 00:12:04,537
Will! Will, come on!

105
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:08,083
Will, come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

106
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:11,378
Easy, brother, easy.

107
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,881
- Hey, fellas, thanks for comin' out.
- Come here!

108
00:12:14,965 --> 00:12:16,426
Whoa! Whoa!

109
00:12:22,181 --> 00:12:23,725
Ah. Fuck.

110
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:35,322
Is it just my imagination,
or has my class grown considerably?

111
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:38,450
Well, by no stretch
of my imagination...

112
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:41,119
do I believe you've all come here
to hear me lecture.

113
00:12:41,202 --> 00:12:46,000
Rather, to ascertain the identity
of the mystery math magician.

114
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:51,047
So without further adieu, come forward,
silent rogue, and receive thy prize.

115
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:05,730
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint
my spectators, but...

116
00:13:05,813 --> 00:13:08,566
it seems there will be
no unmasking here today.

117
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:12,779
However, uh, my colleagues and I
have conferred,

118
00:13:12,862 --> 00:13:15,449
and there is a problem
on the board right now...

119
00:13:15,532 --> 00:13:18,786
that took us
more than two years to prove.

120
00:13:18,827 --> 00:13:22,539
So let this be said:
The gauntlet has been thrown down,

121
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:26,628
but the faculty have answered
and answered with vigor.

122
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,310
Hey, when's the arraignment?

123
00:13:41,394 --> 00:13:43,354
Next week.

124
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,968
Sorry.

125
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:13,053
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

126
00:14:14,722 --> 00:14:17,058
That's people's work.
You can't graffiti here.

127
00:14:17,142 --> 00:14:19,853
- Don't you walk away from me!
- Hey, fuck you!

128
00:14:19,936 --> 00:14:23,023
Oh, you're a clever one.
What's your name?

129
00:14:45,423 --> 00:14:47,383
Oh, my God.

130
00:14:54,057 --> 00:14:55,976
Looks right.

131
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,788
Will, how retarded do you gotta be
to get fired from that job?

132
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:17,583
I mean, how hard is it
to push a motherfuckin' broom around?

133
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,710
Mitch, you got fired
from pushin' a fuckin' broom.

134
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,129
I got fired 'cause
management was restructuring.

135
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,924
Yeah, restructuring the amount
of retards they had workin' for 'em.

136
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,261
Shut up. You get canned
more than tuna, bitch.

137
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:30,681
At least I got a motherfuckin' job
right now, don't I?

138
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:36,396
- Why'd you get fired, Will? Come on.
- Management was restructuring.

139
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:38,982
- My uncle could probably get you on a demo team.
- Can he do that?

140
00:15:39,065 --> 00:15:41,609
You kiddin' me! I asked you
yesterday if I could get a job.

141
00:15:41,693 --> 00:15:43,653
And I told you "no"
yesterday.

142
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:46,323
- What's up, Casey? - What's
up, Case? - What's up, Big Case?

143
00:15:49,243 --> 00:15:52,329
Let's sit over here.

144
00:15:52,413 --> 00:15:54,331
All right. Let's go.

145
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,507
Oh, this is- this is
a Harvard bar, huh?

146
00:16:02,591 --> 00:16:04,926
I thought there'd be, like,
equations and shit on the wall.

147
00:16:06,887 --> 00:16:10,641
I will take a pitcher
of the finest lager in the house.

148
00:16:17,524 --> 00:16:21,778
Timeout. I'm gonna have to bust a little move
on them Harvard hotties down there at the bar.

149
00:16:21,862 --> 00:16:25,783
- Work some magic.
- Get some potion for us.

150
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:43,844
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, hello.

151
00:16:43,928 --> 00:16:46,056
- Hi. How are ya?
- Fine.

152
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,099
- So, do you ladies, uh-
- Come here often?

153
00:16:48,183 --> 00:16:50,060
Do I come here?
I come here a bit.

154
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:53,229
I'm here, you know,
from time to time.

155
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:55,733
- Do you go to school here?
- Yep.

156
00:16:55,775 --> 00:17:01,030
- Yeah, that's it. I think I had a class with you.
- Oh, yeah. What class?

157
00:17:01,113 --> 00:17:03,074
- History.
- Maybe.

158
00:17:03,115 --> 00:17:05,118
Yes, I think
that's what it was.

159
00:17:05,202 --> 00:17:08,789
You don't necessarily- may not
remember me. You know, I like it here.

160
00:17:08,872 --> 00:17:12,960
- It doesn't mean 'cause I go here, I'm a genius. I am very smart.
- Hey.

161
00:17:13,043 --> 00:17:14,878
- Hey, how's it goin'? How are ya?
- Good. How ya doin'?

162
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,548
What class
did you say that was?

163
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,550
- History.
- Yeah.

164
00:17:19,592 --> 00:17:23,137
Just history? It must have been
a survey course then.

165
00:17:23,221 --> 00:17:25,140
- Yeah, it was. It was surveys.
- Right.

166
00:17:25,224 --> 00:17:27,559
You should check it out. It's a good
course. It'd be a good class.

167
00:17:27,643 --> 00:17:32,231
- How'd you like that course?
- You know, frankly,

168
00:17:32,273 --> 00:17:34,985
- I found that class, you know, rather elementary.
- Elementary.

169
00:17:35,068 --> 00:17:36,987
- You know, I don't doubt that it was.
- Yeah.

170
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,073
I, uh,
I remember that class.

171
00:17:40,156 --> 00:17:43,660
It was, um-
It was just between recess and lunch.

172
00:17:43,743 --> 00:17:46,247
Clark, why don't you
go away?

173
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,916
- Why don't you relax?
- Why don't you go away?

174
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,502
- I'm just havin' fun with my new friend.
- Are we gonna have a problem?

175
00:17:51,585 --> 00:17:54,255
No, no, no, no.
There's no problem here.

176
00:17:54,297 --> 00:17:57,759
I was just hoping you might give me
some insight into the evolution...

177
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:01,013
of the market economy
in the southern colonies.

178
00:18:01,096 --> 00:18:06,561
My contention is that prior to the
Revolutionary War, the economic modalities-

179
00:18:06,644 --> 00:18:09,397
especially
in the southern colonies-

180
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,108
could most aptly
be characterized as...

181
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,110
- agrarian precapitalist.
- Let me tell you somethin'.

182
00:18:14,152 --> 00:18:16,488
Of course that's your contention.
You're a first-year grad student.

183
00:18:16,572 --> 00:18:20,659
You just got finished readin' some
Marxian historian- Pete Garrison, probably-

184
00:18:20,743 --> 00:18:22,911
You're gonna be convinced of that till
next month when you get to James Lemon.

185
00:18:22,995 --> 00:18:26,041
Then you're gonna be talkin' about how the
economies of Virginia and Pennsylvania...

186
00:18:26,124 --> 00:18:29,252
were entrepreneurial
and capitalist way back in 1740.

187
00:18:29,336 --> 00:18:32,714
That's gonna last until next year. You're
gonna be in here regurgitatin' Gordon Wood,

188
00:18:32,797 --> 00:18:35,843
talkin' about, you know,
the prerevolutionary utopia...

189
00:18:35,927 --> 00:18:38,930
and the capital-forming effects
of military mobilization.

190
00:18:39,013 --> 00:18:41,307
Well,
as a matter of fact, I won't,

191
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,644
because Wood drastically
underestimates the impact of-

192
00:18:44,727 --> 00:18:48,148
Wood drastically underestimates
the impact of social distinctions...

193
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:51,485
predicated upon wealth,
especially inherited wealth.

194
00:18:51,526 --> 00:18:55,782
You got that from Vickers'
Work in Essex County. Page 98, right?

195
00:18:55,865 --> 00:18:58,451
I read that too. Were you gonna
plagiarize the whole thing for us?

196
00:18:58,534 --> 00:19:02,121
Do you have any thoughts
of your own on this matter?

197
00:19:02,205 --> 00:19:05,334
Or is that your thing? You come into
a bar. You read some obscure passage.

198
00:19:05,376 --> 00:19:08,253
Then pretend-
pawn it off as your own.

199
00:19:08,337 --> 00:19:11,966
As your own idea just to impress
some girls? Embarrass my friend?

200
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:15,679
See, the sad thing about a guy like
you is, in 50 years,

201
00:19:15,762 --> 00:19:17,722
you're gonna start doin'
some thinkin' on your own.

202
00:19:17,764 --> 00:19:20,475
You're gonna come up with the fact that
there are two certainties in life.

203
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:22,269
One: Don't do that.

204
00:19:22,352 --> 00:19:25,356
And two: You dropped 150 grand
on a fuckin' education...

205
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:28,442
you could've got for $1.50
in late charges at the public library.

206
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:33,239
Yeah, but
I will have a degree,

207
00:19:33,322 --> 00:19:38,578
and you'll be servin' my kids fries at a
drive through on our way to a skiing trip.

208
00:19:38,662 --> 00:19:41,665
Maybe, but at least
I won't be unoriginal.

209
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:46,379
If you have a problem with that, we could
step outside. We could figure it out.

210
00:19:46,462 --> 00:19:50,675
No, man, there's no problem.
It's cool.

211
00:19:50,758 --> 00:19:52,677
- It's cool?
- Yeah.

212
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,681
- Cool.
- Damn right, it's cool.

213
00:19:55,764 --> 00:19:58,183
How do you like me now?

214
00:20:01,103 --> 00:20:03,480
My boy's wicked smart.

215
00:20:03,564 --> 00:20:07,444
I just spent three minutes in this
fuckin' place and run into a barney, huh?

216
00:20:09,487 --> 00:20:11,364
There it is.

217
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:13,408
- Nice to meet you.
- They were fine, man.

218
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:18,331
I was gonna close the deal, but then
Chuck- Billy insulted one of 'em-

219
00:20:18,414 --> 00:20:21,959
The heavyset girl said I had a receding
hairline, and I was a few pounds overweight.

220
00:20:22,043 --> 00:20:23,961
And I was, like,
"Go fuck yourself."

221
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:26,965
I swallowed a bug.

222
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,135
Hi.

223
00:20:30,218 --> 00:20:33,138
- You're an idiot.
- What?

224
00:20:33,221 --> 00:20:35,266
You're an idiot. I've been sitting
over there for 45 minutes...

225
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,268
waiting for you
to come and talk to me.

226
00:20:37,352 --> 00:20:39,938
But I'm tired now,
and I have to go home.

227
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:42,607
I couldn't sit there anymore
waiting for you.

228
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,609
- I'm Will.
- Skylar.

229
00:20:44,692 --> 00:20:46,612
- Skylar.
- Oh, and by the way,

230
00:20:46,695 --> 00:20:49,990
that guy over there-
Michael Bolton clone-

231
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:52,034
He wasn't sitting with us,
so to speak.

232
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:55,455
- I know. I kinda got that impression.
- Good. Okay.

233
00:20:55,497 --> 00:20:57,457
Well, I've got to go.

234
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,795
Gotta get up early and waste some more
money on my overpriced education.

235
00:21:01,878 --> 00:21:04,047
- No, I didn't mean you.
- That's all right.

236
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,760
There's my number. Maybe we can
go out for coffee sometime.

237
00:21:07,802 --> 00:21:11,472
All right, yeah. Maybe we can just get
together and eat a bunch of caramels.

238
00:21:11,555 --> 00:21:13,474
- What do you mean?
- When you think about it,

239
00:21:13,557 --> 00:21:18,438
- it's as arbitrary as drinkin' coffee.
- Oh. Yeah. Okay.

240
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,525
Uh, right, then.

241
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:25,154
Oh, come on. You're kidding.

242
00:21:27,657 --> 00:21:29,575
Yo!

243
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:31,536
- Fuck you, bitch!
- Fuck you.

244
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:35,291
- There goes them fuckin' barneys right now with his skiin' trip.
- Hold on.

245
00:21:35,374 --> 00:21:37,835
We should've beat
that old bitch's ass.

246
00:21:44,967 --> 00:21:47,012
Do you like apples?

247
00:21:48,346 --> 00:21:50,265
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

248
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:55,479
Well, I got her number!
How do you like them apples?

249
00:22:47,912 --> 00:22:49,872
Come.

250
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:57,464
Excuse me? Is this
the Buildings and Grounds office?

251
00:22:57,547 --> 00:22:59,925
Yeah. What can I do
for you?

252
00:22:59,967 --> 00:23:02,052
I just need the name
of a student who works here.

253
00:23:02,094 --> 00:23:04,554
- No students work for me.
- Could you please check?

254
00:23:04,596 --> 00:23:06,766
I have this guy
who works in my building.

255
00:23:06,849 --> 00:23:09,268
- He's about this high.
- Which one is your building?

256
00:23:09,352 --> 00:23:12,271
- Two.
- Two. Building two.

257
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,447
- Look, if anything was stolen, I should know about it.
- No, it's nothing like that.

258
00:23:20,489 --> 00:23:22,700
I just need his name.

259
00:23:22,783 --> 00:23:26,663
- I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
- This is Professor Lambeau.

260
00:23:26,746 --> 00:23:28,748
And this is
Professor Hayes.

261
00:23:28,832 --> 00:23:30,792
Tom, please.

262
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:37,008
This is important.
Please.

263
00:23:37,091 --> 00:23:39,302
Will didn't show
for work today.

264
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:43,014
Got this job through
his P.O. You can call him.

265
00:23:43,097 --> 00:23:47,102
- P.O.?
- Yeah. Parole officer.

266
00:23:51,148 --> 00:23:53,108
Thank you.

267
00:23:54,151 --> 00:23:56,279
Asshole.

268
00:23:58,364 --> 00:24:03,703
There is a lengthy legal precedent,
Your Honor, going back to 1789,

269
00:24:03,786 --> 00:24:06,874
whereby a defendant can claim self-defense
against an agent of the government...

270
00:24:06,957 --> 00:24:10,336
if that act is deemed a defense against
tyranny, a defense of liberty.

271
00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:12,546
Your Honor, Henry Ward Beecher,

272
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:16,384
- in Proverbs from the Plymouth
Pulpit, 1887, said, quote- - 1887?

273
00:24:16,468 --> 00:24:18,303
- Excuse me.
- This is the 20th century.

274
00:24:18,345 --> 00:24:22,599
- He's gonna make a mockery.
- I am afforded the right to speak in my own defense, sir,

275
00:24:22,682 --> 00:24:25,394
by the Constitution
of the United States.

276
00:24:25,478 --> 00:24:27,313
- Don't tell me about the Constitution.
- This guarantees my liberty.

277
00:24:27,355 --> 00:24:29,857
"Liberty," in case you've forgotten,
is a soul's right to breathe.

278
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,485
When it cannot take a long breath,
laws are girded too tight.

279
00:24:32,526 --> 00:24:34,820
- Without liberty, man is a syncope.
- Man is a what?

280
00:24:34,904 --> 00:24:38,075
- Ibid., Your Honor.
- Son, my turn.

281
00:24:38,158 --> 00:24:42,829
I've been sitting here for ten minutes
now lookin' over this rap sheet of yours.

282
00:24:42,913 --> 00:24:46,918
I just can't believe it.
June '93, assault.

283
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:49,087
September '93, assault.

284
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:52,757
Grand theft auto,
February of '94.

285
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:57,054
Where, apparently, you defended yourself
and had the case thrown out by citing...

286
00:24:57,137 --> 00:25:01,322
"free property rights
of horse and carriage" from 1798.

287
00:25:01,364 --> 00:25:04,993
Joke. January '95,
impersonating an officer.

288
00:25:05,035 --> 00:25:08,997
Mayhem, theft, resisting.
All overturned.

289
00:25:09,081 --> 00:25:13,043
I'm also aware that you've been
through several foster homes.

290
00:25:13,085 --> 00:25:17,048
The state removed you from three
because of serious physical abuse.

291
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:21,552
You know, another judge might care,
but you hit a cop. You're going in.

292
00:25:21,594 --> 00:25:25,057
Motion to dismiss is denied.
$50,000 bail.

293
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,725
Thank you.

294
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:28,352
Rise.

295
00:25:31,021 --> 00:25:33,065
- Hello?
- Uh, Skylar?

296
00:25:33,148 --> 00:25:35,277
- Yep.
- Hey, uh, it's Will.

297
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,028
- Who?
- It's Will.

298
00:25:37,112 --> 00:25:40,198
You know, the really funny, good-looking
guy you met at the bar the other night.

299
00:25:40,282 --> 00:25:43,910
I don't recall meeting anyone who matches
that description. I think I'd remember.

300
00:25:43,994 --> 00:25:47,456
Oh, all right, you got me. It's the
ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser...

301
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,458
who got hammered and wouldn't
leave you alone all night.

302
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:53,671
Oh, Will! I remember.

303
00:25:53,754 --> 00:25:57,050
How are you?
I was wondering if you'd call me.

304
00:25:57,092 --> 00:25:59,052
- Yeah, look, I was wondering-
- Yo, what's up, baby?

305
00:25:59,094 --> 00:26:03,223
- Hold on one second.
- What you doing? Want some of my ass?

306
00:26:03,307 --> 00:26:06,894
- Herve, I remember you from juvi. How you doing?
- What you doing?

307
00:26:06,978 --> 00:26:09,314
Oh, yeah,
sorry about that.

308
00:26:09,397 --> 00:26:12,150
I was wonderin' maybe we could
get together sometime this week.

309
00:26:12,233 --> 00:26:16,155
- Sit out at a cafe. Maybe have some caramels.
- Oh, that sounds wonderful.

310
00:26:16,238 --> 00:26:19,033
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure. Where are you?

311
00:26:19,116 --> 00:26:22,077
Uh, well, actually,
this is just a shot in the dark,

312
00:26:22,161 --> 00:26:26,416
but, uh, there's no chance
that you're pre-law, is there?

313
00:26:30,629 --> 00:26:32,547
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

314
00:26:33,632 --> 00:26:35,551
Nice talking to ya.

315
00:26:38,137 --> 00:26:40,264
What the fuck
do you want?

316
00:26:40,306 --> 00:26:43,142
I'm Gerald Lambeau.

317
00:26:43,225 --> 00:26:46,146
Professor you told
to fuck himself.

318
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:50,400
Well, what the fuck
do you want?

319
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:54,529
I've spoken to the judge, and he's agreed
to release you under my supervision.

320
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,033
- Really?
- Yeah.

321
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:04,959
- Under two conditions.
- What are those?

322
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:07,670
First condition is that
you meet with me every week.

323
00:27:07,753 --> 00:27:11,090
- What for?
- Go over the proof you're working on,

324
00:27:11,173 --> 00:27:15,929
get into
some more advanced...

325
00:27:16,012 --> 00:27:18,974
combinatorial mathematics,

326
00:27:19,057 --> 00:27:21,017
finite math.

327
00:27:23,186 --> 00:27:25,106
Sounds like a real hoot.

328
00:27:26,524 --> 00:27:29,777
And the second condition
is that-

329
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,154
that you see a therapist.

330
00:27:35,951 --> 00:27:39,329
I'm responsible to submit reports
on those meetings.

331
00:27:39,371 --> 00:27:44,418
If you fail to meet with any of those
conditions, you will have to serve time.

332
00:27:44,501 --> 00:27:48,923
All right. I'll do the math, but I'm not
gonna meet with any fuckin' therapist.

333
00:27:49,007 --> 00:27:52,927
It's better than spending
that time in jail, isn't it?

334
00:28:56,539 --> 00:29:00,794
I read your book, and "Mike"
was havin' the same problems...

335
00:29:00,877 --> 00:29:03,088
that "Chad," the stockbroker,
was havin'.

336
00:29:03,171 --> 00:29:06,175
Absolutely right. Right on the button.
Good for you, Will.

337
00:29:06,258 --> 00:29:08,219
- Very nice.
- Thank you.

338
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,222
Will, the pressures-
and I'm not judging them.

339
00:29:11,305 --> 00:29:14,100
I'm not labeling them,

340
00:29:14,183 --> 00:29:17,104
but they are destroying
your potential.

341
00:29:17,187 --> 00:29:22,234
No more shenanigans.
No more tomfoolery. No more ballyhoo.

342
00:29:22,317 --> 00:29:27,198
You're right.
God, I know.

343
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,077
You're not gonna get off that easily.
Come on, Will. A bit more.

344
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:36,208
- Well, I mean, I do do things, you
know? - What- What kind of things?

345
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,877
I do things that, you know,
I mean, I hide from people.

346
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:44,341
- You hide, do you? - No, no. I
mean, I like- I go places. I interact.

347
00:29:44,425 --> 00:29:46,469
- Really? What sort of places?
- Just certain clubs.

348
00:29:46,553 --> 00:29:48,638
More. That's nice. Yes.
What sort of clubs?

349
00:29:48,722 --> 00:29:51,099
Like, uh, like Fantasy.

350
00:29:51,182 --> 00:29:54,728
Fantasy. That's nice.
A bit more.

351
00:29:54,769 --> 00:29:58,399
It's something like when you get
in there, the music, like, owns you.

352
00:29:58,482 --> 00:30:00,985
It's like that house music. It's like-

353
00:30:03,904 --> 00:30:06,408
- You know, you start dancin'.
- Boom, boom, boom. Yeah.

354
00:30:06,491 --> 00:30:08,827
It's just-

355
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,579
Yes.

356
00:30:14,249 --> 00:30:16,753
Do you find it hard to hide
the fact that you're gay?

357
00:30:16,836 --> 00:30:19,672
What are you talking about? What?

358
00:30:19,756 --> 00:30:22,508
Look, buddy, two seconds ago,
you were ready to give me a jump.

359
00:30:22,592 --> 00:30:26,096
A jump? Are you-

360
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,140
I'm terribly sorry
to disappoint you.

361
00:30:28,223 --> 00:30:30,976
Hey, I don't have a problem with it.
I don't care if you putt from the rough.

362
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:34,981
What are you- P- Putting from the rough?
What on earth are you talking about?

363
00:30:35,023 --> 00:30:40,278
A difficult theorem
could be like a symphony.

364
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,906
It's very erotic.

365
00:30:42,989 --> 00:30:45,326
You go somewhere else.
I can't handle this.

366
00:30:45,409 --> 00:30:48,746
- Wow.
- Thank you, Henry.

367
00:30:48,829 --> 00:30:51,540
- Ah, Henry.
- Hi, Gerry.

368
00:30:51,624 --> 00:30:54,043
You know something?
I can't do this pro bono work anymore.

369
00:30:54,126 --> 00:30:56,630
- It's just not- It's not worth it.
- What happened?

370
00:30:56,713 --> 00:30:58,674
Well, I'm going on national
television next week.

371
00:30:58,715 --> 00:31:02,219
I mean, I haven't got time to tell you, much
less talk to that raving looney in there.

372
00:31:02,302 --> 00:31:05,223
An absolute lunatic,
he is.

373
00:31:05,306 --> 00:31:07,850
Henry.

374
00:31:07,934 --> 00:31:10,603
Okay,
you are in your bed, Will.

375
00:31:10,687 --> 00:31:14,315
Now, how old are you?

376
00:31:15,442 --> 00:31:17,361
Seven.

377
00:31:17,444 --> 00:31:19,363
What do you see?

378
00:31:21,198 --> 00:31:23,867
Something's in my room.

379
00:31:23,951 --> 00:31:26,538
What is it?

380
00:31:26,621 --> 00:31:31,626
It's like a- It's a figure.
It's hoverin' over me.

381
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:35,256
You are in a safe place,
Will.

382
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:38,843
It's t-
It's touchin' me.

383
00:31:38,926 --> 00:31:41,846
Where is it touching you?

384
00:31:41,887 --> 00:31:44,390
It's touching me
down there,

385
00:31:45,934 --> 00:31:48,020
and I'm nervous.

386
00:31:48,103 --> 00:31:51,857
You don't have to be
nervous, Will.

387
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:55,778
We start dancin' and dancin'.

388
00:31:55,862 --> 00:31:57,780
It's just beautiful,

389
00:31:57,864 --> 00:31:59,782
'cause we can make...

390
00:31:59,866 --> 00:32:05,289
a lot of love
before the sun goes down.

391
00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:23,391
- I'm sorry, Rich.
- I have better things to do with my time.

392
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:27,021
Come on! One dance!

393
00:32:27,104 --> 00:32:29,940
You really hypnotized me,
you know?

394
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:33,819
- For God's sake, Will.
- What? Oh, come on. He left. You can't pin that on me.

395
00:32:33,903 --> 00:32:37,157
- I told you to cooperate with these people.
- Look...

396
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,618
- into my eyes.
- Get out, Will.

397
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,245
I don't need therapy.

398
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:46,125
That's enough. Get out!

399
00:32:46,209 --> 00:32:50,380
- I called Mel Weintraub this
morning to see- - Oh, what's the use?

400
00:32:50,463 --> 00:32:52,382
What do you want to do?

401
00:32:54,425 --> 00:32:59,014
- Well, there's someone.
- Who is he?

402
00:32:59,098 --> 00:33:04,520
He used to be my, uh-
my roommate in college.

403
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:11,987
Trust. Very important
in a relationship.

404
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,072
It's also very important
in a clinical situation.

405
00:33:14,155 --> 00:33:16,993
Why is trust
the most important thing...

406
00:33:17,034 --> 00:33:21,455
in making a breakthrough
with a client?

407
00:33:21,497 --> 00:33:26,044
Maureen, stop the oral fixation
for a moment and join us.

408
00:33:26,128 --> 00:33:29,715
- Vinnie.
- Um-

409
00:33:29,798 --> 00:33:32,759
Because, uh-

410
00:33:32,843 --> 00:33:35,805
Trust is, uh-
Trust is life.

411
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:39,559
Wow. That's very deep.
Thank you, Vinnie.

412
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:42,353
Next time,
get the notes from your brother.

413
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,816
If a patient doesn't feel safe enough trust
you, then they won't be honest with you.

414
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:48,027
Then there's really no point
for them being in therapy.

415
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:52,197
I mean, hey, if they don't trust you, you're
never gonna get them to sleep with you.

416
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:55,285
That should be the goal of any good
therapist. Nail 'em while they're vulnerable.

417
00:33:55,368 --> 00:33:57,037
That's my motto.

418
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,664
Oh, good, everyone's back.
Welcome back, everybody.

419
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:04,836
- Hello, Sean.
- Hey, Gerry.

420
00:34:06,922 --> 00:34:12,053
Um, ladies and gentlemen,
we are in the presence of greatness.

421
00:34:12,136 --> 00:34:16,141
Professor Gerald Lambeau, Field's medal
winner for combinatorial mathematics.

422
00:34:16,224 --> 00:34:19,019
- Hello.
- Anyone know what the Field's medal is?

423
00:34:19,061 --> 00:34:21,855
It's a really big deal.
It's like the Nobel prize for math.

424
00:34:21,938 --> 00:34:26,986
Except they only give it out once
every four years. It's a great thing.

425
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:30,156
It's an amazing honor.
Okay, everybody, that's it for today.

426
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:33,660
Thanks. We'll see you Monday.
We'll be talking about Freud.

427
00:34:33,743 --> 00:34:37,039
Why he did enough cocaine
to kill a small horse. Thank you.

428
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:41,585
- How are you?
- It's good to see you.

429
00:34:41,669 --> 00:34:43,587
Good to see you.

430
00:34:43,671 --> 00:34:47,258
- Sean, I think I got something interesting for ya.
- Yeah?

431
00:34:47,342 --> 00:34:49,844
What, you have to have
blood and urine? What's up?

432
00:34:49,928 --> 00:34:52,222
Why didn't you come
to the reunion?

433
00:34:52,305 --> 00:34:55,768
You know, I'm-
I've been busy.

434
00:34:55,851 --> 00:34:57,770
- You were missed.
- Really?

435
00:34:57,853 --> 00:35:02,191
- So how long has it been since we've seen each other?
- Before Nancy died.

436
00:35:02,274 --> 00:35:04,193
Yeah, I'm sorry.

437
00:35:04,276 --> 00:35:06,947
I was in Paris.
It was that damn conference.

438
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,699
I got your card.
It was nice.

439
00:35:14,162 --> 00:35:16,082
- Come here.
- Now that's a takedown.

440
00:35:16,124 --> 00:35:20,003
Hey, what happened?
Did you get leniency or what?

441
00:35:20,086 --> 00:35:24,799
I got, uh, probation
and then counseling two days a week.

442
00:35:24,882 --> 00:35:28,595
Joke. You're a smoothie.
Come on, Morgan! Just submit!

443
00:35:30,931 --> 00:35:32,850
Hey, Bill, just-just get off him.
We're gonna miss the game.

444
00:35:32,933 --> 00:35:34,935
- I've got a full schedule. I'm very busy.
- Sean, Sean.

445
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:38,023
This-This boy is incredible.
I've never seen anything like him.

446
00:35:38,106 --> 00:35:41,484
What makes him
so incredible, Gerry?

447
00:35:41,526 --> 00:35:45,614
- You ever heard of Ramanujan?
- Yeah, yeah. No.

448
00:35:45,698 --> 00:35:50,453
It's a man. He lived
over 100 years ago. He was Indian.

449
00:35:50,494 --> 00:35:53,372
- Dots, not feathers.
- Not feathers. Yeah.

450
00:35:53,456 --> 00:35:55,375
He lived in this tiny hut
somewhere in India.

451
00:35:55,459 --> 00:35:57,878
He had no formal education.

452
00:35:57,961 --> 00:36:00,464
- He had no access to any scientific work.
- Coffee?

453
00:36:00,547 --> 00:36:02,799
- You, sir?
- Just a little.

454
00:36:02,841 --> 00:36:05,261
But he came across
this old math book,

455
00:36:05,345 --> 00:36:07,972
and from the simple text,
he was able to extrapolate theories...

456
00:36:08,014 --> 00:36:09,974
that had baffled
mathematicians for years.

457
00:36:10,016 --> 00:36:13,144
Yes. Continued fractions.
He wrote, uh-

458
00:36:13,186 --> 00:36:17,316
- Well, he mailed it to Hardy at Cambridge.
- Yeah, Cambridge. Yeah.

459
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:20,652
- And Hardy immediately recognized
the brilliance of his work... - Mm-hmm.

460
00:36:20,736 --> 00:36:24,323
And brought him over to England,
and then they worked together for years,

461
00:36:24,406 --> 00:36:26,910
creating some of the most
exciting math theory ever done.

462
00:36:26,993 --> 00:36:29,329
This-This Ramanujan-

463
00:36:29,371 --> 00:36:33,375
his-his genius
was unparalleled, Sean.

464
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:36,879
- Well, this boy's just like that.
- Hmm.

465
00:36:36,921 --> 00:36:40,508
- But he's- he's a bit defensive.
- Hmm.

466
00:36:40,591 --> 00:36:42,551
I need someone
who can get through to him.

467
00:36:42,635 --> 00:36:46,181
- Like me?
- Yeah, like you.

468
00:36:46,223 --> 00:36:49,351
- Why?
- Well, because you have the same kind of background.

469
00:36:49,393 --> 00:36:52,688
- What background?
- Well, you're from the same neighborhood.

470
00:36:52,771 --> 00:36:56,067
- He's from Southie?
- Yeah.

471
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,986
Boy genius from Southie.

472
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:03,199
- How many shrinks you go to before me?
- Five.

473
00:37:03,282 --> 00:37:07,705
- Let me guess. Barry? Henry? Not Rick?
- Yeah. Yeah.

474
00:37:07,746 --> 00:37:10,874
- Sean, please, just meet
with him once a week. - Mm-hmm.

475
00:37:10,916 --> 00:37:12,876
Please?

476
00:37:15,964 --> 00:37:19,134
It's a poker game with this kid.
Don't let him know what you've got.

477
00:37:19,217 --> 00:37:22,303
He probably even read your book,
if he could find it.

478
00:37:22,387 --> 00:37:24,764
It's gonna be hard
for him to find.

479
00:37:24,848 --> 00:37:26,267
- Hi, Will.
- Hi.

480
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,269
This is Sean Maguire.
Will Hunting.

481
00:37:28,352 --> 00:37:30,271
How are ya?

482
00:37:34,734 --> 00:37:36,695
- Yeah. Let's get started.
- Yeah, let's do it.

483
00:37:36,737 --> 00:37:38,822
I'm pumped.
Let's let the healing begin.

484
00:37:38,905 --> 00:37:42,409
- Will you excuse us?
- Yeah, please, Tom.

485
00:37:42,492 --> 00:37:45,079
You, too, Gerry.

486
00:37:45,163 --> 00:37:47,081
Yeah, of course.

487
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,422
How are you?

488
00:37:56,467 --> 00:37:58,802
Where you from
in Southie?

489
00:37:58,886 --> 00:38:01,764
- I like what you've done with the place.
- Oh, thanks.

490
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:04,099
Do you buy all these books
retail,

491
00:38:04,183 --> 00:38:08,271
or do you send away for, like, a "shrink kit"
that comes with all these volumes included?

492
00:38:08,355 --> 00:38:11,900
- Do you like books?
- Yeah.

493
00:38:11,983 --> 00:38:14,110
- Did you read any of these books?
- I don't know.

494
00:38:14,194 --> 00:38:16,947
- How about any of these books?
- Probably not.

495
00:38:17,031 --> 00:38:20,701
What about the ones
on the top shelf? You read those?

496
00:38:20,785 --> 00:38:24,747
- Yeah, I read those.
- Good for you. What do you think about 'em?

497
00:38:24,789 --> 00:38:27,667
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report.
They're your books. Why don't you read 'em?

498
00:38:27,751 --> 00:38:29,586
I did. I had to.

499
00:38:29,628 --> 00:38:33,090
- Must've taken you a long time.
- Yeah, it did.

500
00:38:39,764 --> 00:38:44,686
United States of America:
A Complete History, Volume I.

501
00:38:55,073 --> 00:38:58,618
Jesus. If you wanna read
a real history book,

502
00:38:58,702 --> 00:39:00,662
read Howard Zinn's
A People's History in the United States.

503
00:39:00,745 --> 00:39:02,664
That book'll fuckin'
knock you on your ass.

504
00:39:02,747 --> 00:39:04,749
Better than Chomsky's
Manufacturing Consent?

505
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:09,630
- Do you think that's a good book?
- You fuckin' people baffle me.

506
00:39:09,672 --> 00:39:14,343
You spend all your money on these fuckin'
fancy books. You surround yourselves with 'em.

507
00:39:14,427 --> 00:39:16,805
- They're the wrong fuckin' books.
- What are the right fuckin' books, Will?

508
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:21,226
- Whatever blows your hair back.
- Yeah. Haven't got much hair left.

509
00:39:21,309 --> 00:39:23,895
Hey, you know you'd be better
shoving that cigarette up your ass.

510
00:39:23,979 --> 00:39:26,107
- It'd probably be healthier for you.
- Yeah, I know.

511
00:39:26,149 --> 00:39:29,610
- It really gets in the way of my yoga.
- You work out, huh?

512
00:39:29,694 --> 00:39:32,613
- What, you lift?
- Yeah.

513
00:39:32,655 --> 00:39:35,200
- Nautilus?
- No, free weights.

514
00:39:35,284 --> 00:39:36,660
- Oh, really? Free weights, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, big time.

515
00:39:36,744 --> 00:39:37,995
- Yeah?
- Just like that.

516
00:39:38,078 --> 00:39:42,833
- What do you bench?
- 285. What do you bench?

517
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:45,086
You paint that?

518
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:47,088
- Yeah. Do you paint?
- Uh-uh.

519
00:39:47,172 --> 00:39:50,633
- Do you sculpt?
- No.

520
00:39:50,717 --> 00:39:53,053
Do you like art?

521
00:39:53,136 --> 00:39:57,433
- Do you like music?
- This is a real piece of shit.

522
00:39:57,516 --> 00:39:59,435
Oh, tell me what
you really think.

523
00:39:59,518 --> 00:40:05,150
Just the linear and impressionistic mix
makes a very muddled composition.

524
00:40:05,233 --> 00:40:09,446
It's also a Winslow Homer rip-off, except
you got whitey rowin' the boat there.

525
00:40:09,529 --> 00:40:11,448
Well, it's art, Monet.
It wasn't very good.

526
00:40:11,531 --> 00:40:13,992
- That's not really what concerns me though.
- What concerns you?

527
00:40:14,076 --> 00:40:16,496
- Just the coloring.
- You know what the real bitch of it is?

528
00:40:16,537 --> 00:40:18,664
It's paint-by-number.

529
00:40:18,748 --> 00:40:21,209
Is it color-by-number? Because
the colors are fascinating to me.

530
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,752
- Aren't they really?
- You bet.

531
00:40:22,835 --> 00:40:26,507
I think you're about one step away
from cuttin' your fuckin' ear off.

532
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,175
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

533
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:31,887
Think I should move to the south of
France, change my name to "Vincent"?

534
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:35,308
- You ever heard the sayin', "any port in a storm"?
- Yeah.

535
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:38,353
- Yeah, maybe that means you.
- In what way?

536
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:41,856
- Maybe you're in the middle of a storm, a big fuckin' storm.
- Yeah, maybe.

537
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,111
The sky's fallin' on your head. The
waves are crashin' over your little boat.

538
00:40:45,194 --> 00:40:47,279
The oars are about to snap.

539
00:40:47,363 --> 00:40:49,323
You just piss in your pants.
You're cryin' for the harbor.

540
00:40:49,407 --> 00:40:51,659
So maybe you do
what you gotta do to get out.

541
00:40:51,742 --> 00:40:54,078
You know, maybe you became
a psychologist.

542
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,666
Bingo. That's it. Let me do my job now.
You start with me. Come on.

543
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:05,466
- Maybe you married the wrong woman.
- Maybe you should watch your mouth!

544
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:08,469
Watch it right there, chief,
all right?

545
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:12,265
Ah.

546
00:41:16,103 --> 00:41:18,647
That's it, isn't it?

547
00:41:18,731 --> 00:41:22,234
You married
the wrong woman.

548
00:41:22,276 --> 00:41:26,948
What happened?
What, did she leave you?

549
00:41:27,032 --> 00:41:30,035
Was she, you know-
banging some other guy?

550
00:41:32,078 --> 00:41:34,831
If you ever disrespect my wife again,
I will end you.

551
00:41:34,914 --> 00:41:37,001
I will fuckin' end you.

552
00:41:37,084 --> 00:41:40,518
Got that, chief?

553
00:41:40,601 --> 00:41:42,520
Time's up.

554
00:41:42,603 --> 00:41:44,940
Yeah.

555
00:41:58,204 --> 00:42:00,123
At ease, gentlemen.

556
00:42:06,255 --> 00:42:08,174
You okay?

557
00:42:13,596 --> 00:42:17,601
Look, I'll understand if you don't
wanna meet with him again.

558
00:42:17,642 --> 00:42:21,396
Thursday, 4:00.
Make sure the kid's here.

559
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:25,610
Yeah.

560
00:42:25,651 --> 00:42:27,612
Thanks.

561
00:43:31,598 --> 00:43:34,936
Well, you look lovely
in those glasses.

562
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,938
- Thank you very much.
- They're just beautiful.

563
00:43:37,022 --> 00:43:40,942
- Yes, I always wanted dark blue eye shadow.
- Wonderful.

564
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:46,991
Growing up in England, you know,
I went to a very nice school.

565
00:43:47,074 --> 00:43:52,371
You know, it was kind of progressive,
organic, do-it-yourself, private school.

566
00:43:52,413 --> 00:43:56,877
Then Harvard.
Hopefully med school.

567
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,920
You know, I figured out,
by the end,

568
00:43:58,962 --> 00:44:03,258
my brain's gonna be worth
$250,000.

569
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:06,888
That sounded horrible,
didn't it?

570
00:44:06,929 --> 00:44:09,599
Bring me another mai tai!

571
00:44:09,682 --> 00:44:13,895
Yeah, that's cool. I mean,
I bet your parents were happy to pay.

572
00:44:13,936 --> 00:44:17,858
No, I was happy to pay.
I inherited the money.

573
00:44:17,941 --> 00:44:21,362
Wow. Is Harvard gettin'
all that money?

574
00:44:21,445 --> 00:44:24,448
No, Stanford. I'm going there
in June when I graduate.

575
00:44:24,531 --> 00:44:29,579
All right, so you just wanted to use
this sailor and then run away, huh?

576
00:44:29,621 --> 00:44:32,874
I was gonna, you know, experiment on you
for anatomy class first, obviously.

577
00:44:32,957 --> 00:44:35,252
In that case, that's fine.

578
00:44:35,294 --> 00:44:38,089
- Hey, you wanna see my magic tricks, Skylar?
- Of course.

579
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:41,342
All right.
Promise to-

580
00:44:41,425 --> 00:44:43,719
All right.

581
00:44:43,803 --> 00:44:47,474
- This one's for you, Rudolph.
- Wait, wait. You need my wand.

582
00:44:47,557 --> 00:44:50,394
All right, give me a hit.
Thank you. All right.

583
00:44:50,477 --> 00:44:52,396
I'm gonna make
all these caramels disappear.

584
00:44:52,479 --> 00:44:55,274
You ready?
Ready.

585
00:44:55,316 --> 00:44:57,944
One, two, three.

586
00:44:57,985 --> 00:45:00,988
They're all gone.

587
00:45:01,072 --> 00:45:03,616
That was my- It works better
when I have my rabbit.

588
00:45:03,783 --> 00:45:06,662
Well-

589
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:09,373
I don't really date,
you know, that much.

590
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:14,378
How very unfortunate...
I think for me.

591
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:17,757
You know what I mean?
I know you've been thinking about it.

592
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:19,759
- Oh, no, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.

593
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:22,512
- No, I really haven't.
- Yes, you have. You were hoping to get a good night kiss.

594
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:25,683
No, you know, I tell ya,
I was hopin' to get a good night laid.

595
00:45:28,185 --> 00:45:30,688
But I'll settle for,
like, a kiss, you know?

596
00:45:30,771 --> 00:45:33,566
- How very noble of you.
- Thank you.

597
00:45:33,649 --> 00:45:37,112
- Mm.
- No, I was- I was hopin' for a kiss.

598
00:45:38,488 --> 00:45:42,659
Well, why don't we just
get it out of the way now?

599
00:45:42,743 --> 00:45:45,163
- Right now?
- Yeah.

600
00:45:45,246 --> 00:45:47,165
Come on.

601
00:45:55,424 --> 00:45:58,469
I think I got
some of your pickle.

602
00:46:09,022 --> 00:46:11,483
You again, huh?

603
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,654
Come with me.

604
00:46:21,535 --> 00:46:26,958
So what's this?
A Taster's Choice moment between guys?

605
00:46:27,042 --> 00:46:31,630
This is really nice. You got a thing
for swans? Is this, like, a fetish?

606
00:46:31,713 --> 00:46:34,007
Is it something, like, maybe
we need to devote some time to?

607
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:41,265
- Thought about what you said to me the other day. About my painting.
- Oh.

608
00:46:41,349 --> 00:46:44,268
Stayed up half the night
thinking about it.

609
00:46:45,479 --> 00:46:47,648
Something occurred to me.

610
00:46:47,731 --> 00:46:52,277
I fell into a deep, peaceful sleep
and haven't thought about you since.

611
00:46:52,361 --> 00:46:55,323
- You know what occurred to me?
- No.

612
00:46:55,407 --> 00:46:59,911
You're just a kid. You don't have the
faintest idea what you're talking about.

613
00:46:59,994 --> 00:47:03,081
- Why, thank you.
- It's all right.

614
00:47:03,164 --> 00:47:05,584
You've never been
out of Boston.

615
00:47:07,753 --> 00:47:09,714
Nope.

616
00:47:09,755 --> 00:47:11,924
So if I asked you about art,
you'd probably give me the skinny...

617
00:47:12,007 --> 00:47:14,593
on every art book
ever written.

618
00:47:14,677 --> 00:47:18,432
Michelangelo?
You know a lot about him.

619
00:47:18,515 --> 00:47:22,185
Life's work, political aspirations.
Him and the pope.

620
00:47:22,269 --> 00:47:27,066
Sexual orientation.
The whole works, right?

621
00:47:27,108 --> 00:47:31,571
I bet you can't tell me what it
smells like in the Sistine Chapel.

622
00:47:33,281 --> 00:47:37,745
You never actually stood there
and looked up at that beautiful ceiling.

623
00:47:40,414 --> 00:47:42,916
Seeing that.

624
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,919
If I ask you about women,

625
00:47:45,003 --> 00:47:48,673
you'll probably give me a syllabus
of your personal favorites.

626
00:47:48,757 --> 00:47:51,676
You may have even been laid
a few times.

627
00:47:56,766 --> 00:48:00,019
But you can't tell me what it feels like
to wake up next to a woman...

628
00:48:00,102 --> 00:48:02,521
and feel truly happy.

629
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:07,569
You're a tough kid.

630
00:48:09,404 --> 00:48:13,241
I ask you about war, you'd probably
throw Shakespeare at me, right?

631
00:48:13,325 --> 00:48:16,746
"Once more into the breach,
dear friends."

632
00:48:17,997 --> 00:48:21,084
But you've never been near one.

633
00:48:21,167 --> 00:48:23,920
You've never held your best friend's
head in your lap...

634
00:48:24,003 --> 00:48:28,425
and watch him gasp his last
breath lookin' to you for help.

635
00:48:30,344 --> 00:48:35,517
If I asked you about love,
you'd probably quote me a sonnet,

636
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:39,771
but you've never looked at a woman
and been totally vulnerable.

637
00:48:39,854 --> 00:48:44,150
Known someone that could
level you with her eyes.

638
00:48:44,192 --> 00:48:48,656
Feelin' like God put
an angel on Earth just for you,

639
00:48:48,739 --> 00:48:51,700
who could rescue you
from the depths of hell.

640
00:48:51,784 --> 00:48:54,996
And you wouldn't know
what it's like to be her angel,

641
00:48:55,038 --> 00:48:58,125
to have that love for her
be there forever.

642
00:48:58,208 --> 00:49:02,671
Through anything.
Through cancer.

643
00:49:02,754 --> 00:49:05,007
And you wouldn't know about sleepin'
sittin' up in a hospital room...

644
00:49:05,091 --> 00:49:07,176
for two months,
holding her hand,

645
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:09,178
because the doctors
could see in your eyes...

646
00:49:09,262 --> 00:49:13,850
that the terms "visiting hours"
don't apply to you.

647
00:49:13,933 --> 00:49:16,103
You don't know about real loss,

648
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:21,191
'cause that only occurs when you love
something more than you love yourself.

649
00:49:21,275 --> 00:49:25,196
I doubt you've ever dared
to love anybody that much.

650
00:49:27,574 --> 00:49:32,537
I look at you. I don't see
an intelligent, confident man.

651
00:49:34,873 --> 00:49:38,294
I see a cocky,
scared shitless kid.

652
00:49:40,046 --> 00:49:43,382
But you're a genius, Will.
No one denies that.

653
00:49:43,466 --> 00:49:47,012
No one could possibly understand
the depths of you.

654
00:49:47,095 --> 00:49:50,182
But you presume to know everything about
me because you saw a painting of mine.

655
00:49:50,265 --> 00:49:53,185
You ripped
my fuckin' life apart.

656
00:49:56,689 --> 00:49:59,108
You're an orphan, right?

657
00:50:02,945 --> 00:50:06,992
Do you think I'd know the first thing
about how hard your life has been-

658
00:50:07,076 --> 00:50:09,661
how you feel, who you are-

659
00:50:09,745 --> 00:50:13,123
because I read Oliver Twist?

660
00:50:13,207 --> 00:50:15,460
Does that encapsulate you?

661
00:50:17,796 --> 00:50:20,799
Personally, I don't give a shit
about all that, because-

662
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,009
You know what? I can't
learn anything from you...

663
00:50:23,093 --> 00:50:25,513
I can't read
in some fuckin' book.

664
00:50:27,348 --> 00:50:29,433
Unless you wanna talk
about you,

665
00:50:29,517 --> 00:50:31,435
who you are.

666
00:50:32,937 --> 00:50:36,817
And I'm fascinated.
I'm in.

667
00:50:38,985 --> 00:50:41,905
But you don't wanna do that,
do you, sport?

668
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:47,161
You're terrified
of what you might say.

669
00:50:52,208 --> 00:50:54,127
Your move, chief.

670
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:04,079
Hello? Hello?

671
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:07,041
Hello?

672
00:52:07,083 --> 00:52:10,002
Professor Valenti,
are you calling me again?

673
00:52:12,922 --> 00:52:14,840
Freak.

674
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,306
- Oh, God.
- Christ, who did you call?

675
00:52:21,389 --> 00:52:23,892
- No one. I forgot the number.
- You fuckin' retarded?

676
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:26,521
You went all the way out there in the
rain, and you didn't bring the number.

677
00:52:26,562 --> 00:52:30,525
No, it was your mother's 900 number.
I just ran out of quarters.

678
00:52:30,566 --> 00:52:33,152
Why don't we get off on mothers?
I just got off yours.

679
00:52:33,236 --> 00:52:35,364
- That's
pretty funny, Morgan.

680
00:52:35,447 --> 00:52:37,908
That's a fuckin' nickel,
bitch.

681
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:40,285
- Keep antagonizing me. Watch what happens.
- All right, then, Morgan.

682
00:52:40,369 --> 00:52:42,204
- Watch what happens.
- All right, then, Morgan.

683
00:52:42,287 --> 00:52:44,415
Keep fuckin' with me.

684
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,298
No smoking.

685
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:26,920
What do you mean, he didn't talk?
You were in there for an hour.

686
00:53:26,962 --> 00:53:30,257
He just sat there counting the seconds
until the session was over.

687
00:53:30,299 --> 00:53:33,010
- Pretty impressive, actually.
- Why would he do that?

688
00:53:33,093 --> 00:53:37,098
To prove to me he doesn't have
to talk to me if he doesn't want to.

689
00:53:37,182 --> 00:53:41,144
What is this? Some kind of staring contest
between two kids from the old neighborhood?

690
00:53:41,186 --> 00:53:44,982
Yeah, it is,
and I can't talk first.

691
00:53:45,065 --> 00:53:50,029
We know your theory, Alexander, but the
boy's found a simple geometrical picture.

692
00:53:50,112 --> 00:53:53,115
- A tree structure won't work.
- Look now. He's joining the two vertices.

693
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:55,702
But I can do the sum.

694
00:53:55,786 --> 00:53:58,246
- It's how you group the terms, Alexander.
- But, Gerry.

695
00:53:58,330 --> 00:54:00,248
If we do the whole thing
this way, then-

696
00:54:00,332 --> 00:54:03,085
Hey, look, look.

697
00:54:03,168 --> 00:54:06,589
I wrote it down.
It's simpler this way.

698
00:54:17,184 --> 00:54:20,062
Sometimes
people get lucky.

699
00:54:20,145 --> 00:54:22,106
You're a brilliant man.

700
00:54:59,397 --> 00:55:01,983
You know,
I was on this plane once,

701
00:55:02,066 --> 00:55:04,902
and I'm sittin' there, and...

702
00:55:04,987 --> 00:55:06,905
the captain gets on,
he does his whole, you know,

703
00:55:06,989 --> 00:55:09,575
"we'll be cruisin' at 35,000 feet,"
but then he puts the mike down.

704
00:55:09,658 --> 00:55:12,327
- He forgets to turn it off.
- Mm-hmm.

705
00:55:12,411 --> 00:55:14,329
So he turns to the copilot.
He's, like,

706
00:55:14,413 --> 00:55:19,127
"You know, all I could use right now is
a fuckin' blow job and a cup of coffee."

707
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:21,755
So the stewardess fuckin' goes bombin'
up from the back of the plane...

708
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:23,506
to tell him
the microphone's still on.

709
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:26,927
This guy in the back of the plane's like,
"Hey, hon, don't forget the coffee."

710
00:55:26,969 --> 00:55:30,473
You ever been on a plane?

711
00:55:30,556 --> 00:55:33,559
No, but it's a fuckin' joke. It works
better if I tell it in the first person.

712
00:55:33,601 --> 00:55:35,562
Yeah, it does.

713
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:40,609
I have been laid,
you know?

714
00:55:40,692 --> 00:55:42,944
Really? Good for you.

715
00:55:43,028 --> 00:55:44,947
- Big time, big time.
- Big time, huh?

716
00:55:45,031 --> 00:55:48,159
I went on a date last week.

717
00:55:48,242 --> 00:55:51,245
- How'd it go?
- It was good.

718
00:55:51,329 --> 00:55:53,289
- Goin' out again?
- I don't know.

719
00:55:53,331 --> 00:55:55,000
- Why?
- Haven't called her.

720
00:55:55,084 --> 00:55:58,420
- Christ, you're an amateur.
- I know what I'm doin'.

721
00:55:58,462 --> 00:56:02,758
Yeah. Don't worry about me.
I know what I'm doin'.

722
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,303
Yeah, but this girl was, like,
you know, beautiful.

723
00:56:05,345 --> 00:56:09,766
She's smart. She's fun. She's different
from most of the girls I've been with.

724
00:56:09,808 --> 00:56:13,645
- So call her up, Romeo.
- Why, so I can realize she's not that smart.

725
00:56:13,728 --> 00:56:16,065
That she's fuckin' boring?
You know, I mean, you don't-

726
00:56:16,148 --> 00:56:19,610
This girl's, like, fuckin' perfect
right now. I don't wanna ruin that.

727
00:56:19,652 --> 00:56:23,614
Maybe you're perfect right now.
Maybe you don't wanna ruin that.

728
00:56:25,283 --> 00:56:27,619
But I think that's
a super philosophy, Will.

729
00:56:27,661 --> 00:56:33,542
That way, you can go through your entire life
without ever having to really know anybody.

730
00:56:35,837 --> 00:56:37,797
My wife used to fart
when she was nervous.

731
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:40,883
She had all sorts
of wonderful idiosyncrasies.

732
00:56:40,967 --> 00:56:43,553
You know, she used to fart
in her sleep.

733
00:56:43,636 --> 00:56:46,515
Just thought I'd share that
with you.

734
00:56:46,557 --> 00:56:49,143
One night it was so loud,
it woke the dog up.

735
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,898
She woke up and gone, like,
"Was that you?"

736
00:56:54,983 --> 00:56:58,153
I said, "Yeah." I didn't have
the heart to tell her. Oh, God.

737
00:56:58,236 --> 00:57:00,488
- She woke herself up?
- Yes.

738
00:57:05,536 --> 00:57:10,833
Oh, Christ. But, Will, she's been dead
two years and that's the shit I remember.

739
00:57:10,875 --> 00:57:14,044
It's wonderful stuff, you know?
Little things like that.

740
00:57:14,128 --> 00:57:18,091
Yeah, but those are the things
I miss the most.

741
00:57:18,175 --> 00:57:21,094
Those little idiosyncrasies
that only I knew about.

742
00:57:21,178 --> 00:57:23,764
That's what made her
my wife.

743
00:57:23,847 --> 00:57:27,226
Boy, and she had the goods on me too.
She knew all my little peccadillos.

744
00:57:27,268 --> 00:57:31,731
People call these things
"imperfections," but they're not.

745
00:57:31,814 --> 00:57:34,567
That's the good stuff.

746
00:57:34,609 --> 00:57:39,281
And then we get to choose who
we let into our weird little worlds.

747
00:57:39,364 --> 00:57:41,283
You're not perfect, sport.

748
00:57:41,366 --> 00:57:44,036
And let me save you
the suspense.

749
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:47,415
This girl you met,
she isn't perfect either.

750
00:57:47,457 --> 00:57:51,294
But the question is whether or not
you're perfect for each other.

751
00:57:51,377 --> 00:57:55,716
That's the whole deal.
That's what intimacy is all about.

752
00:57:55,758 --> 00:57:57,718
Now you can know
everything in the world, sport,

753
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,888
but the only way you're findin' out
that one is by givin' it a shot.

754
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:03,641
You certainly won't learn
from an old fucker like me.

755
00:58:03,724 --> 00:58:07,395
Even if I did know,
I wouldn't tell a pissant like you.

756
00:58:07,479 --> 00:58:09,439
Yeah, why not?

757
00:58:09,523 --> 00:58:13,235
You told me every other
fuckin' thing. Jesus Christ.

758
00:58:13,318 --> 00:58:16,114
Fuckin' talk more than any shrink
I ever seen in my life.

759
00:58:16,155 --> 00:58:20,215
I teach the shit.
I didn't say I knew how to do it.

760
00:58:20,256 --> 00:58:22,217
Yeah.

761
00:58:25,304 --> 00:58:27,973
You ever think
about gettin' remarried?

762
00:58:28,057 --> 00:58:30,601
My wife's dead.

763
00:58:30,684 --> 00:58:33,813
- Hence the word "remarried."
- She's dead.

764
00:58:36,441 --> 00:58:39,694
Yeah, well, I think
that's a super philosophy, Sean.

765
00:58:39,778 --> 00:58:41,947
I mean, that way, you can actually
go through the rest of your life...

766
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:44,658
without ever really knowing
anybody.

767
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,288
Time's up.

768
00:59:03,762 --> 00:59:05,974
- Hold it open.
- Okay.

769
00:59:06,057 --> 00:59:09,352
Thanks.

770
00:59:36,299 --> 00:59:39,594
"G" minor seventh.
Saddest of all chords.

771
00:59:40,928 --> 00:59:42,847
- Hello.
- Hey.

772
00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:47,227
- Where have you been? - I'm sorry. I've
been, like- I've been really busy, and-

773
00:59:47,311 --> 00:59:49,897
- But, um-
- Mmm. Me too.

774
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:55,153
Yeah. I-
I thought you'd call.

775
00:59:55,236 --> 00:59:57,363
Yeah, um-

776
00:59:57,447 --> 01:00:00,784
- I mean, we had a really good time.
- I had a really good time too.

777
01:00:00,867 --> 01:00:03,036
I mean, I just- I-

778
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:05,247
I'm sorry, you know.
I blew it.

779
01:00:05,331 --> 01:00:07,458
No. No, I mean,
you know, it's all right.

780
01:00:07,541 --> 01:00:10,711
Yeah, um, so, I was
wonderin' if, uh,

781
01:00:10,795 --> 01:00:12,713
if, you know, you'd give me
another crack at it.

782
01:00:12,797 --> 01:00:15,383
You know, let me
take you out again.

783
01:00:15,467 --> 01:00:18,136
- I can't.
- All right.

784
01:00:18,178 --> 01:00:21,598
Oh, no, I didn't- I didn't mean
I can't, like, ever.

785
01:00:21,681 --> 01:00:23,600
I just can't right now.

786
01:00:23,683 --> 01:00:26,687
I've got to assign
the proton spectrum for "ebogamine."

787
01:00:26,771 --> 01:00:30,775
All that sounds really, really interesting.
It's actually fantastically boring.

788
01:00:30,858 --> 01:00:33,736
- All right, um-
- Maybe some other time.

789
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:37,825
- Like tomorrow?
- Um, yeah, all right.

790
01:00:37,908 --> 01:00:40,369
- Okay.
- Okay.

791
01:00:40,411 --> 01:00:42,788
- Bye.
- Bye.

792
01:00:54,509 --> 01:00:57,012
What are you doing here?

793
01:00:57,096 --> 01:00:59,348
I couldn't wait
till tomorrow.

794
01:00:59,432 --> 01:01:02,393
Where the fuck
did you get this?

795
01:01:02,476 --> 01:01:04,562
I had to sleep
with someone in your class.

796
01:01:04,645 --> 01:01:10,277
Oh, I hope it was someone with the
open-toed sandals and the really bad breath.

797
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:14,322
- Come on. Let's go have some fun.
- No, I've got to learn this.

798
01:01:14,406 --> 01:01:17,034
Well, you're not going into
surgery tomorrow, are you?

799
01:01:17,118 --> 01:01:19,078
- No.
- Let's go.

800
01:01:23,207 --> 01:01:26,670
Oh, my God!
My dog is winning!

801
01:01:26,754 --> 01:01:29,047
Come on, Misty!

802
01:01:29,131 --> 01:01:31,842
Come on! Run!
Look at that! Come on!

803
01:01:31,925 --> 01:01:33,844
Look, there he goes.
Misty, run! Come on!

804
01:01:36,181 --> 01:01:40,393
- We won.
- He totally won.

805
01:01:42,312 --> 01:01:44,564
So did you grow up
around here then?

806
01:01:44,647 --> 01:01:46,859
Not far.
South Boston.

807
01:01:49,445 --> 01:01:51,405
Still glowing from my win.

808
01:01:51,447 --> 01:01:55,076
Look at you.
You're so happy.

809
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,204
And what was
that like then?

810
01:01:57,287 --> 01:02:00,916
It was normal, I guess.
Nothin' special.

811
01:02:00,999 --> 01:02:04,211
Do you got lots of
brothers and sisters?

812
01:02:04,294 --> 01:02:07,507
- Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
- That's what I said.

813
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:13,137
- Well, Irish Catholic, what do you think?
- Right. That's right.

814
01:02:13,221 --> 01:02:18,185
- How many?
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

815
01:02:18,268 --> 01:02:21,772
- Why? Go on. What? Five?
- No.

816
01:02:21,855 --> 01:02:25,110
Seven? Eight?
How many?

817
01:02:25,193 --> 01:02:27,403
- I have 12 big brothers.
- You do not!

818
01:02:27,487 --> 01:02:30,281
No, I swear to God. I swear to God.
I'm lucky 13 right here.

819
01:02:30,365 --> 01:02:32,325
Do you know
all their names?

820
01:02:32,367 --> 01:02:34,954
Do I- Yeah,
they're my brothers.

821
01:02:35,037 --> 01:02:37,123
What are they called?

822
01:02:37,206 --> 01:02:41,544
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey,
Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny and Brian.

823
01:02:41,627 --> 01:02:44,088
Say it again.

824
01:02:44,171 --> 01:02:48,260
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey,
Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny and Brian.

825
01:02:48,343 --> 01:02:50,929
And Willy.

826
01:02:51,012 --> 01:02:52,305
- Willy?
- Yeah.

827
01:02:52,389 --> 01:02:53,890
- Will.
- Wow.

828
01:02:53,974 --> 01:02:57,770
- Do you still see all of them?
- Yeah, well, they all live in Southie.

829
01:02:57,854 --> 01:03:00,440
- I'm livin' with three of 'em right now.
- Oh, yeah?

830
01:03:00,523 --> 01:03:01,983
- Yeah.
- I'd like to meet them.

831
01:03:02,066 --> 01:03:04,444
Yeah, we'll do that.

832
01:03:04,652 --> 01:03:07,030
Oh, you know,
I read your book last night.

833
01:03:07,114 --> 01:03:09,658
Oh, so you're the one.

834
01:03:09,741 --> 01:03:11,702
Do you still, uh-
Do you still counsel veterans?

835
01:03:11,785 --> 01:03:13,078
No, I don't.

836
01:03:13,162 --> 01:03:17,834
- Why not?
- Well, I gave it up when my wife got sick.

837
01:03:17,876 --> 01:03:23,423
You ever wonder what your life would be
like if you, uh, if you never met your wife?

838
01:03:23,506 --> 01:03:25,426
What? Wonder if I'd be
better off without her?

839
01:03:25,509 --> 01:03:27,636
- No, no, no, I'm not saying, like, better off.
- No.

840
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:31,682
- I didn't mean it like that.
- It's all right. It's an important question.

841
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:34,018
'Cause you'll have bad times,
but that'll always wake you up...

842
01:03:34,101 --> 01:03:36,354
to the good stuff
you weren't paying attention to.

843
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:39,024
And you don't regret
meetin' your wife?

844
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:41,818
Why? 'Cause the pain
I feel now?

845
01:03:41,902 --> 01:03:47,241
Oh, I got regrets, Will, but I don't
regret a single day I spent with her.

846
01:03:51,078 --> 01:03:54,457
So when did you know, like,
that she was the one for you?

847
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:57,252
October 21, 1975.

848
01:03:57,336 --> 01:03:59,421
Jesus Christ.
You know the fuckin' day?

849
01:03:59,505 --> 01:04:04,510
Oh, yeah, 'cause it was game six of the
World Series, biggest game in Red Sox history.

850
01:04:04,593 --> 01:04:09,682
- Yeah, sure.
- My friends and I had slept out all night to get tickets.

851
01:04:09,766 --> 01:04:13,228
- You got tickets?
- Yep. Day of the game I was sittin' in a bar,

852
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:16,816
waitin' for the game to start
and in walks this girl.

853
01:04:16,899 --> 01:04:20,236
It was an amazing game though. You know,
bottom of the eighth, Carbo ties it up.

854
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:22,446
It was 6-6.
It went to 12.

855
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:26,368
Bottom of the 12th, in stepped
Carlton Fisk, old Pudge.

856
01:04:26,451 --> 01:04:28,495
Steps up to the plate.
You know, he's got that weird stance.

857
01:04:28,578 --> 01:04:32,165
- Yeah, yeah. - And then-
Boom! He clocks it, you know.

858
01:04:32,249 --> 01:04:34,919
High fly ball
down the left field line!

859
01:04:34,961 --> 01:04:37,547
Thirty-five thousand people
on their feet, yellin' at the ball.

860
01:04:37,630 --> 01:04:40,133
But that's nothin', 'cause Fisk,
he's wavin' at the ball like a madman.

861
01:04:40,216 --> 01:04:42,135
- Yeah, I've seen that.
- "Get over! Get over!

862
01:04:42,218 --> 01:04:43,636
- Right.
- Get over!"

863
01:04:43,719 --> 01:04:48,142
Then it hits the foul pole.
He goes ape-shit, and 35,000 fans-

864
01:04:48,183 --> 01:04:50,269
They charge the field,
you know.

865
01:04:50,352 --> 01:04:52,688
Yeah, and he's fuckin'
blowin' people outta the way.

866
01:04:52,771 --> 01:04:54,899
"Get outta the way!
Get outta the way!"

867
01:04:54,983 --> 01:04:58,111
I can't fuckin' believe you had
tickets to that fuckin' game!

868
01:04:58,194 --> 01:05:01,281
- Did you rush the field?
- No, I didn't rush the fuckin' field. I wasn't there.

869
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:04,367
- What?
- No, I was in a bar, havin' a drink with my future wife.

870
01:05:04,451 --> 01:05:09,039
You missed Pudge Fisk's home run to have a
fuckin' drink with some lady you never met?

871
01:05:09,123 --> 01:05:11,292
Yeah, but you should have
seen her. She was a stunner.

872
01:05:11,375 --> 01:05:13,919
- I don't care if-
- Oh, no, no, she lit up the room.

873
01:05:14,003 --> 01:05:16,965
- I don't care if Helen of Troy walks into the room.
- Oh, Helen of Troy!

874
01:05:17,048 --> 01:05:19,176
That's game six! Oh, my God,
and who were these friends of yours?

875
01:05:19,259 --> 01:05:21,553
- They let you get away with that?
- They had to.

876
01:05:21,636 --> 01:05:25,224
- What did you say to 'em?
- I just slid my ticket across the table.

877
01:05:25,308 --> 01:05:28,394
I said, "Sorry, guys.
I gotta see about a girl."

878
01:05:28,478 --> 01:05:30,646
- "I gotta go see about a girl"?
- Yes!

879
01:05:30,688 --> 01:05:32,690
That's what you said?
They let you get away with that?

880
01:05:32,774 --> 01:05:34,902
Oh, yeah. They saw it
in my eyes that I meant it.

881
01:05:34,985 --> 01:05:38,781
- You're kiddin' me?
- No, I'm not kidding you, Will.

882
01:05:38,864 --> 01:05:41,492
That's why I'm not talkin' right now about
some girl I saw at a bar 20 years ago...

883
01:05:41,575 --> 01:05:44,036
and how I always regretted
not goin' over and talkin' to her.

884
01:05:44,077 --> 01:05:47,248
I don't regret the 18 years
I was married to Nancy.

885
01:05:47,332 --> 01:05:50,376
I don't regret the six years I had
to give up counseling when she got sick,

886
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:54,172
and I don't regret the last years
when she got really sick.

887
01:05:54,255 --> 01:05:56,884
And I sure as hell don't
regret missin' a damn game.

888
01:05:56,967 --> 01:05:59,678
That's regret.

889
01:05:59,762 --> 01:06:02,014
Wow!

890
01:06:07,062 --> 01:06:09,689
Would have been nice
to catch that game though.

891
01:06:09,773 --> 01:06:12,317
I didn't know Pudge
was gonna hit a home run.

892
01:06:14,402 --> 01:06:18,491
You know, I'm very, very
useful on the court.

893
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:21,661
I'm extremely tall.

894
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:24,580
- You're not that tall.
- I dunk.

895
01:06:26,125 --> 01:06:30,712
Will I ever play in the N.B.A.?

896
01:06:30,754 --> 01:06:34,341
"It is decidedly so."
Hmph.

897
01:06:36,761 --> 01:06:39,430
Why do we always stay here?

898
01:06:39,514 --> 01:06:42,142
'Cause it's nicer
than my place.

899
01:06:42,225 --> 01:06:44,686
Yes, but I've never
seen your place.

900
01:06:44,769 --> 01:06:47,022
I know.

901
01:06:47,106 --> 01:06:49,567
When am I gonna meet
your friends and your brothers?

902
01:06:49,608 --> 01:06:53,070
Well, they don't really
come down here that much.

903
01:06:53,154 --> 01:06:55,282
I think I can make it
to South Boston.

904
01:06:55,365 --> 01:07:00,036
It's kind of a hike.

905
01:07:00,162 --> 01:07:03,081
Is it me you're hiding from them
or the other way around?

906
01:07:03,165 --> 01:07:05,710
- All right, we'll go.
- When?

907
01:07:05,751 --> 01:07:08,212
I don't know.
We'll go sometime next week.

908
01:07:08,254 --> 01:07:13,718
What if I said I would not sleep with you
again until you let me meet your friends?

909
01:07:19,391 --> 01:07:23,061
I'd say it's, like, 4:30 in the mornin'.
They're probably up.

910
01:07:23,103 --> 01:07:26,399
Oh, my God.
Men are shameless.

911
01:07:26,441 --> 01:07:30,778
If you're not thinking with your wiener,
then you're acting directly on its behalf.

912
01:07:30,862 --> 01:07:34,407
You bet. And on behalf of my wiener,
can I get an advance payment?

913
01:07:34,491 --> 01:07:39,205
I don't know. Let's ask.
"Outlook does not look good."

914
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:42,666
- What? - Fuck the- Hey, Chuck.
No. Nothing. Go back to sleep.

915
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:45,962
"Outlook"? That's the same thing that
told you you was gonna play in the N.B.A.

916
01:07:46,046 --> 01:07:50,091
Exactly, so look out. You'd better
start buying some season tickets.

917
01:07:50,175 --> 01:07:54,972
Mmm! I plan to. I'm tall.
I like wearing shorts.

918
01:07:55,056 --> 01:07:57,266
Hook, hook. Dunk, dunk.

919
01:07:57,350 --> 01:08:00,144
- You're not that tall.
- Yes, I am.

920
01:08:00,228 --> 01:08:03,272
Maybe I'm all
about three points.

921
01:08:03,314 --> 01:08:05,609
I'm all about home runs.

922
01:08:05,651 --> 01:08:09,905
Stop mixing your
sporting metaphors.

923
01:08:21,459 --> 01:08:25,005
A leprechaun's got his dick
in the monkey's ass.

924
01:08:25,089 --> 01:08:28,801
Morgan comes runnin' in, goin',
"I don't mind it. I don't mind-"

925
01:08:30,886 --> 01:08:34,598
Well, I can't believe you brought Skylar here
when we're fuckin' all bombed and drinkin'.

926
01:08:34,682 --> 01:08:37,978
I know, Morgan. It's a real rarity
we'd be all drinkin'.

927
01:08:38,019 --> 01:08:40,897
My uncle Marty drinks. He'll go
on a bender for six, eight months.

928
01:08:40,981 --> 01:08:43,817
Did I ever tell ya what happened to him when
he was drivin' up there and got pulled over?

929
01:08:43,859 --> 01:08:46,154
- I told you guys, right?
- Marty, yeah.

930
01:08:46,237 --> 01:08:49,824
Let me tell ya what happened to my uncle
Marty, because you oughta know this.

931
01:08:49,907 --> 01:08:53,286
He's always tellin' stories. Every time
we come here he's got another story.

932
01:08:53,369 --> 01:08:57,332
But we all heard this one.
Go ahead. Say it anyway.

933
01:08:57,416 --> 01:09:02,546
I will go ahead. Thanks a lot.
Guess I have the floor now.

934
01:09:02,629 --> 01:09:05,300
My uncle Marty's
drivin' home, right?

935
01:09:05,383 --> 01:09:10,138
Bombed out of his tree, right? Just
hammered out of his gourd. Just wrecked.

936
01:09:10,221 --> 01:09:14,350
This state trooper sees him, pulls him
over. So my uncle's fucked basically.

937
01:09:14,392 --> 01:09:16,645
Got him out of the car,
tryin' to make him walk the line.

938
01:09:16,729 --> 01:09:20,566
He gets out of the car, pukes, and the
statie's pretty sure he's over the legal limit.

939
01:09:20,649 --> 01:09:24,445
So he's about to throw the cuffs
on him and put him in jail.

940
01:09:24,528 --> 01:09:28,575
All of a sudden, 50 yards down the road,
there's this huge fuckin' boom.

941
01:09:28,658 --> 01:09:32,162
- Statie gets real spooked.
He turns around- - He got shot?

942
01:09:32,245 --> 01:09:35,208
No. So- So- You
heard this story before.

943
01:09:35,249 --> 01:09:37,210
Yeah, Morgan, stop.
Stop.

944
01:09:37,251 --> 01:09:40,588
Some other guy's car had hit a tree.
There was an accident.

945
01:09:40,671 --> 01:09:42,590
Anyway-

946
01:09:42,673 --> 01:09:44,801
- How could he hear-
- Shut the fuck up!

947
01:09:44,884 --> 01:09:47,846
- You're drivin' him nuts.
- I'm gonna break your neck. Shut up!

948
01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:49,890
He told you the story
once before.

949
01:09:49,932 --> 01:09:52,643
So he tells my uncle,
"Stay here. Don't move."

950
01:09:52,726 --> 01:09:56,648
Statie goes runnin' down the road
to deal with the other accident.

951
01:09:56,731 --> 01:10:00,652
After a few minutes of just
lyin' in his own piss and vomit,

952
01:10:00,735 --> 01:10:02,737
my uncle starts wonderin'
what he's doin' there.

953
01:10:02,779 --> 01:10:05,324
Gets up, gets in his car
and just drives home.

954
01:10:05,407 --> 01:10:08,410
The next mornin'
my uncle's just passed out.

955
01:10:08,452 --> 01:10:10,746
He hears this knockin' at the door.

956
01:10:10,788 --> 01:10:13,749
So he goes downstairs,
pulls the door open- "What?"

957
01:10:13,791 --> 01:10:15,794
It's the state trooper
that pulled him over.

958
01:10:15,836 --> 01:10:17,796
Statie says,
"Fuck you mean, 'What? '

959
01:10:17,838 --> 01:10:21,383
You know what. I pulled you over
last night is what, and you took off."

960
01:10:21,466 --> 01:10:24,010
He's like, "I never
seen you before in my life.

961
01:10:24,094 --> 01:10:26,806
I've been home all night with my kids.
I don't know who the fuck you are."

962
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:30,184
He's like, "You know who I am.
Let me get in your garage."

963
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:32,603
My uncle's like, "What?" He said, "You
heard me. Let me get in your garage."

964
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:35,315
He was like, "All right. Fine." Takes
him out to the garage, opens the door.

965
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:40,612
And there's- The statie's police
cruiser is in my uncle's garage.

966
01:10:40,654 --> 01:10:43,157
He was so fuckin'-

967
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:45,702
He was so fuckin' hammered
he drove the wrong car home.

968
01:10:45,785 --> 01:10:49,539
The best part about it is,
the fuckin' state trooper...

969
01:10:49,622 --> 01:10:52,041
was so embarrassed
he didn't do anything.

970
01:10:52,125 --> 01:10:55,462
He'd been drivin' around all night in my
uncle's Chevelle, lookin' for the house.

971
01:10:55,504 --> 01:10:59,550
All right, Chuck, what the fuck
is the point of your story?

972
01:10:59,633 --> 01:11:01,844
He got away.
That's the point.

973
01:11:01,927 --> 01:11:05,098
- Well, question-
- Come on. Stop.

974
01:11:05,182 --> 01:11:07,976
- I'm tryin' to clarify somethin'.
- You're embarrassing him.

975
01:11:08,018 --> 01:11:10,520
- It doesn't make any sense.
- It does make sense,

976
01:11:10,604 --> 01:11:12,564
if you listen to the story
and quit askin' questions.

977
01:11:12,647 --> 01:11:15,985
Well, let's see if you can get this one.
I've got a little story for you.

978
01:11:16,027 --> 01:11:20,781
All right, there's an old couple
in bed, Mary and Paddie.

979
01:11:20,865 --> 01:11:26,413
They wake up on the morning
of their 50th anniversary.

980
01:11:26,497 --> 01:11:29,625
Mary looks over and
gazes adoringly at Paddie.

981
01:11:29,708 --> 01:11:31,752
She's like,
"Oh, Jesus, Paddie.

982
01:11:31,835 --> 01:11:34,087
You're such a good-looking
feller. I love ya.

983
01:11:34,171 --> 01:11:36,549
I want to give ya
a little present.

984
01:11:36,591 --> 01:11:39,552
Anything your little heart desires,
I'm goin' to give it to ya.

985
01:11:39,636 --> 01:11:41,554
What would ya like?

986
01:11:41,638 --> 01:11:46,310
Paddie's like, "Oh, gee, Mary.
That's a very sweet offer.

987
01:11:46,393 --> 01:11:51,315
Now, in 50 years, there's one thing
that's been missing,

988
01:11:51,398 --> 01:11:55,153
and, uh, I would like you
to give me a blow job.

989
01:11:55,237 --> 01:11:58,907
I would like for it."
Mary's like, "All right."

990
01:11:58,990 --> 01:12:03,411
She takes her teeth out, puts 'em in
the glass. She gives him a blow job.

991
01:12:03,495 --> 01:12:07,416
Afterwards, Paddie's like, "Yeah, geez,
now that's what I've been missin'.

992
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:11,420
That was the most beautiful,
earth-shattering thing ever!

993
01:12:11,462 --> 01:12:13,798
Beautiful, Mary!
I love ya!

994
01:12:13,881 --> 01:12:16,802
Is there anything
that I can do for you?"

995
01:12:16,885 --> 01:12:21,515
Mary looks up to him and she goes,
"Give us a kiss."

996
01:12:21,598 --> 01:12:23,892
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

997
01:12:23,934 --> 01:12:27,355
- That's filthy.
- It's not that filthy. I've heard filthy.

998
01:12:31,776 --> 01:12:35,739
- Get off of me!
- All right. See you guys later.

999
01:12:35,823 --> 01:12:39,076
All right.
Take it easy, Bill.

1000
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:41,620
So, Skylar,
thanks for comin' by.

1001
01:12:41,704 --> 01:12:43,664
Changed my opinion
of Harvard people.

1002
01:12:43,747 --> 01:12:47,210
You don't want to rush to judgment on
that one, 'cause they're not all like me.

1003
01:12:47,294 --> 01:12:50,005
Oh. I'm sure.
It was nice to meet ya.

1004
01:12:50,088 --> 01:12:52,757
- Oh.
- Take it easy. Slowly back away.

1005
01:12:52,799 --> 01:12:56,929
- Oh, come on. Brother.
- I don't know what you're doin', dude.

1006
01:12:56,971 --> 01:12:59,640
- You're givin' us a ride.
- What the fuck do I look like to you?

1007
01:12:59,724 --> 01:13:03,144
- Come on, Chuck.
- You're walkin', bitch. Will's takin' the car.

1008
01:13:03,227 --> 01:13:06,440
All right, thanks, sucker.
I appreciate it.

1009
01:13:06,523 --> 01:13:09,443
I don't know what you're
gettin' all serious about.

1010
01:13:09,485 --> 01:13:13,405
- You're droppin' me off first.
- It's really out of the way.

1011
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:16,367
Oh, okay. Just 'cause you don't have to
sleep in your one-room palace tonight...

1012
01:13:16,451 --> 01:13:18,369
don't start
thinkin' you're bad.

1013
01:13:18,453 --> 01:13:20,705
Hey, wait a minute. You said
we were gonna see your place.

1014
01:13:20,788 --> 01:13:23,917
- Not tonight.
- Oh, no, not tonight. Not any other night.

1015
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,588
He knows once you see that shit-hole
he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.

1016
01:13:27,671 --> 01:13:29,673
But I wanted to meet
your brothers.

1017
01:13:29,757 --> 01:13:32,176
We're gonna do that
another time.

1018
01:13:32,259 --> 01:13:34,178
All right.

1019
01:13:36,056 --> 01:13:38,391
Need them keys.

1020
01:13:38,475 --> 01:13:42,479
The stewardess hears this
and goes haulin' ass down the aisle.

1021
01:13:42,562 --> 01:13:45,900
I yell,
"Don't forget the coffee."

1022
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:47,985
No shit!
You didn't say that.

1023
01:13:48,069 --> 01:13:50,488
For Christ's sake, Marty,
it's a joke.

1024
01:13:50,530 --> 01:13:52,698
- I know someone that actually happened to, Marty.
- A joke.

1025
01:13:52,782 --> 01:13:54,367
- Gerry.
- Hi.

1026
01:13:54,450 --> 01:13:56,411
- Have trouble findin' the place?
- No, I took a cab.

1027
01:13:56,495 --> 01:14:00,374
Timmy, this is Gerry.
We went to college together.

1028
01:14:00,415 --> 01:14:02,584
How you doin'?
Nice to meet ya.

1029
01:14:02,668 --> 01:14:04,586
- Pleased to meet you.
- Can I get you a beer?

1030
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:07,131
Um, no, just a Perrier.

1031
01:14:07,215 --> 01:14:09,133
That's French
for club soda.

1032
01:14:09,217 --> 01:14:11,803
- Club soda, yeah.
- Couple of sandwiches too.

1033
01:14:11,886 --> 01:14:13,805
- Sure.
- Put it on my tab.

1034
01:14:13,888 --> 01:14:16,141
You ever plannin'
on payin' your tab?

1035
01:14:16,225 --> 01:14:18,394
Yeah, chief, got the winning
lottery ticket right here.

1036
01:14:18,477 --> 01:14:20,145
- What's the jackpot?
- Twelve million.

1037
01:14:20,229 --> 01:14:24,985
- I don't think that'll cover it.
- It'll cover your sex change operation.

1038
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:32,117
- Nuts?
- No, thank you.

1039
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:37,790
So, you wanted
to talk about Will.

1040
01:14:37,874 --> 01:14:41,752
- Well, it seems to be going well.
- I think so.

1041
01:14:43,129 --> 01:14:45,966
Have you talked to him
at all about his future?

1042
01:14:46,049 --> 01:14:49,761
No, we haven't gotten into that yet.
We're still bangin' away at the past.

1043
01:14:49,803 --> 01:14:53,348
Maybe you should. My phone's been
ringing off the hook with job offers.

1044
01:14:53,432 --> 01:14:57,312
- What kind?
- Cutting edge mathematics, think tanks.

1045
01:14:57,395 --> 01:15:00,704
The kind of place where a mind
like Will's is given free rein.

1046
01:15:00,787 --> 01:15:06,419
That's great that there are offers, but
I don't really think he's ready for that.

1047
01:15:10,173 --> 01:15:12,383
I'm not sure
you understand, Sean.

1048
01:15:12,467 --> 01:15:15,220
- What don't I understand?
- Here you go, guys.

1049
01:15:15,304 --> 01:15:18,474
- Thanks, Tim.
- Yeah, thank you.

1050
01:15:18,557 --> 01:15:20,893
Just so you don't
get sticky fingers.

1051
01:15:20,976 --> 01:15:23,437
Tim, can you help us?

1052
01:15:23,479 --> 01:15:25,940
We're tryin'
to settle a bet.

1053
01:15:25,982 --> 01:15:27,400
Uh-oh.

1054
01:15:27,484 --> 01:15:30,904
- Ever heard of Jonas Salk?
- Sure. Cured polio.

1055
01:15:30,987 --> 01:15:33,656
- Ever heard of Albert Einstein?
- Hey.

1056
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:39,121
How about Gerald Lambeau?
Ever heard of him?

1057
01:15:39,205 --> 01:15:42,958
- No.
- Thank you, Tim.

1058
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,961
- So who won the bet?
- I did.

1059
01:15:47,005 --> 01:15:51,426
This isn't about me, Sean.

1060
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:54,346
I'm nothing compared
to this young man.

1061
01:15:57,850 --> 01:15:59,811
You ever hear of
Gerald Lambeau?

1062
01:15:59,852 --> 01:16:04,524
In 1905 there were hundreds of professors
renown for their study of the universe.

1063
01:16:04,607 --> 01:16:09,154
But it was a 26-year-old
Swiss patent clerk,

1064
01:16:09,196 --> 01:16:11,824
doing physics in his spare time,
who changed the world.

1065
01:16:11,907 --> 01:16:13,867
Can you imagine if Einstein
would have given that up...

1066
01:16:13,909 --> 01:16:16,454
just to get drunk with his buddies
in Vienna every night.

1067
01:16:16,538 --> 01:16:19,165
We all would have
lost something.

1068
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:21,209
Tim would never
have heard of him.

1069
01:16:21,292 --> 01:16:24,379
- Pretty dramatic, Gerry.
- No, it isn't, Sean.

1070
01:16:24,462 --> 01:16:27,049
This boy has that gift.

1071
01:16:27,132 --> 01:16:29,635
He just doesn't got the direction,
but we can give that to him.

1072
01:16:29,718 --> 01:16:35,016
Hey, Gerry, in the 1960s, there was a young
man graduated from University of Michigan.

1073
01:16:35,058 --> 01:16:38,353
Did some brilliant work
in mathematics.

1074
01:16:38,395 --> 01:16:40,856
Specifically,
bounded harmonic functions.

1075
01:16:40,897 --> 01:16:43,984
Then he went on to Berkeley. He was
assistant professor. Showed amazing potential.

1076
01:16:44,067 --> 01:16:46,988
Then he moved to Montana, and
he blew the competition away.

1077
01:16:47,071 --> 01:16:49,991
- Yeah, so who was he?
- Ted Kaczynski.

1078
01:16:50,074 --> 01:16:51,909
Haven't heard of him.

1079
01:16:51,993 --> 01:16:53,911
- Hey, Timmy!
- Yo!

1080
01:16:53,995 --> 01:16:56,748
- Who's Ted Kaczynski?
- Unabomber.

1081
01:16:58,667 --> 01:17:01,753
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

1082
01:17:01,837 --> 01:17:03,755
- We gotta give this kid direction.
- Yeah-

1083
01:17:03,839 --> 01:17:06,217
He can contribute to the world,
and we can help him do that.

1084
01:17:06,259 --> 01:17:08,344
Direction's one thing.
Manipulation's another.

1085
01:17:08,428 --> 01:17:11,264
- Sean-
- We have to let him find-

1086
01:17:11,347 --> 01:17:14,058
I'm not sitting at home every night
twisting my mustache and hatching a plan...

1087
01:17:14,142 --> 01:17:16,103
to ruin this boy's life!

1088
01:17:16,187 --> 01:17:18,606
I was doing advanced mathematics
when I was 18,

1089
01:17:18,647 --> 01:17:21,108
and it still took me over 20 years to do
something worthy of a Field's medal.

1090
01:17:21,192 --> 01:17:23,611
Maybe he doesn't want
what you want.

1091
01:17:23,694 --> 01:17:26,448
There's more to life
than a fuckin' Field's medal.

1092
01:17:26,531 --> 01:17:30,452
This is too important, Sean,
and it's above personal rivalry.

1093
01:17:30,535 --> 01:17:32,954
Wait a minute.
Let's talk about the boy.

1094
01:17:33,038 --> 01:17:35,750
Why don't we give him time
to figure out what he wants?

1095
01:17:35,833 --> 01:17:39,086
That's a wonderful theory, Sean.
It worked wonders for you, didn't it?

1096
01:17:39,170 --> 01:17:41,797
Yeah, it did,
you arrogant fuckin' prick!

1097
01:17:43,216 --> 01:17:46,637
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry
that I came here today.

1098
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,889
I came here out of courtesy.
I wanted to keep you in the loop.

1099
01:17:48,972 --> 01:17:51,099
Nice to be in the loop.

1100
01:17:51,141 --> 01:17:54,770
The boy's in a meeting right now
I set up for him over at McNeil.

1101
01:17:54,812 --> 01:17:59,275
Well, Will, I'm not exactly sure
what you mean.

1102
01:17:59,317 --> 01:18:01,694
We've already
offered you a position.

1103
01:18:01,778 --> 01:18:03,780
Nobody in this town works
without a retainer, guys.

1104
01:18:03,863 --> 01:18:07,117
You think you can find somebody
who does, you have my blessin'.

1105
01:18:07,201 --> 01:18:10,454
But I think we all know that person is
not gonna represent you as well as I can.

1106
01:18:10,538 --> 01:18:13,666
Will, our offer
is $84,000 a year.

1107
01:18:13,749 --> 01:18:18,463
Retainer!
Retainer.

1108
01:18:18,547 --> 01:18:21,299
You want us to give you
cash right now?

1109
01:18:21,383 --> 01:18:25,471
Whoa-ho-ho. Easy-
Now, I didn't say that.

1110
01:18:25,513 --> 01:18:30,768
Allegedly,
your situation, for you,

1111
01:18:30,852 --> 01:18:34,689
would be concurrently
improved if I had...

1112
01:18:34,730 --> 01:18:37,401
$200 in my back pocket
right now.

1113
01:18:37,484 --> 01:18:42,489
I don't think I can- Larry?

1114
01:18:42,573 --> 01:18:46,786
- I've got $73.
- Will you take a check?

1115
01:18:46,870 --> 01:18:51,624
Let me tell you somethin'.
You're suspect.

1116
01:18:51,708 --> 01:18:57,047
Yeah, you. I don't know
what your reputation is in this town,

1117
01:18:57,089 --> 01:18:59,842
but after the shit
you tried to pull today,

1118
01:18:59,884 --> 01:19:02,511
you can bet
I'll be lookin' into you.

1119
01:19:02,553 --> 01:19:07,517
Now, any business
we have heretofore,

1120
01:19:07,559 --> 01:19:11,396
you can speak with
my aforementioned attorney.

1121
01:19:11,438 --> 01:19:13,607
Good day, gentlemen.

1122
01:19:13,690 --> 01:19:17,403
And until that day comes,
keep your ear to the grindstone.

1123
01:19:31,752 --> 01:19:33,670
- How's it goin'?
- Fine.

1124
01:19:33,754 --> 01:19:35,798
Yeah.

1125
01:19:35,882 --> 01:19:37,800
Good.

1126
01:19:38,885 --> 01:19:41,513
- Want some help?
- No!

1127
01:19:41,596 --> 01:19:44,766
Come on. Give me one little peek,
and we'll go to the batting cages.

1128
01:19:44,849 --> 01:19:47,061
No.

1129
01:19:47,102 --> 01:19:50,773
It is actually important
that I learn this.

1130
01:19:50,856 --> 01:19:54,610
- It's really important... to me, okay?
- All right.

1131
01:19:54,693 --> 01:19:59,616
- Why don't we just hang out here all day?
- Yes, why don't we?

1132
01:20:01,993 --> 01:20:05,665
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker.

1133
01:20:05,748 --> 01:20:10,503
Seeing as you're intent
on breaking my balls,

1134
01:20:10,586 --> 01:20:14,173
- let me ask you a question.
- All right.

1135
01:20:14,257 --> 01:20:16,218
Do you have
a photographic memory?

1136
01:20:18,387 --> 01:20:22,307
I don't know. I just kind of remember. I
mean, how do you remember your phone number?

1137
01:20:22,349 --> 01:20:24,309
You just do.

1138
01:20:24,351 --> 01:20:27,272
- Have you studied organic chemistry?
- A little bit.

1139
01:20:27,313 --> 01:20:30,233
- Oh, just for fun?
- Yeah, for kicks.

1140
01:20:30,316 --> 01:20:32,861
Yeah, it's so much fun
studying organic chemistry.

1141
01:20:32,944 --> 01:20:35,573
Are you mad?

1142
01:20:35,656 --> 01:20:38,158
Have you completely
lost your mind?

1143
01:20:38,242 --> 01:20:42,830
Nobody studies it for fun. It's not a
necessity, especially for someone like you.

1144
01:20:42,913 --> 01:20:45,375
- Someone like me?
- Yeah.

1145
01:20:45,458 --> 01:20:49,713
Someone who divides their time, fairly
evenly, between batting cages and bars.

1146
01:20:49,796 --> 01:20:54,301
- I would hardly say it was a necessity.
- Oh.

1147
01:20:54,384 --> 01:20:57,180
You know, there are very
smart people here at Harvard.

1148
01:20:57,263 --> 01:21:01,225
Even they have to study,
because this is really hard.

1149
01:21:01,309 --> 01:21:06,982
And yet... you do it
so easily. I don't understand.

1150
01:21:07,065 --> 01:21:09,151
I don't understand
how your mind works.

1151
01:21:09,193 --> 01:21:11,445
- Did you play the piano?
- I want to talk about this.

1152
01:21:11,528 --> 01:21:13,655
No, I'm trying to explain it to you.
Do you play the piano?

1153
01:21:13,739 --> 01:21:18,328
- Yeah, a bit.
- So when you look at a piano, you see Mozart.

1154
01:21:18,369 --> 01:21:21,998
- I see "Chopsticks."
- All right, well, Beethoven, okay?

1155
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:25,836
He looked at a piano, and it just
made sense to him. He could just play.

1156
01:21:25,961 --> 01:21:28,255
- So what are you saying? You play the piano?
- Not a lick.

1157
01:21:28,297 --> 01:21:32,176
I look at a piano, I see a bunch of
keys, three pedals and a box of wood.

1158
01:21:32,259 --> 01:21:37,057
But Beethoven, Mozart-
They saw it. They could just play.

1159
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:41,102
I couldn't paint you a picture. I
probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway.

1160
01:21:41,144 --> 01:21:46,609
- And I can't play the piano. - But you
can do my O- chem paper in under an hour.

1161
01:21:46,651 --> 01:21:52,198
Right. Well, I mean, when it came to
stuff like that, I could always just play.

1162
01:21:53,574 --> 01:21:55,536
That's the best
I can explain it.

1163
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:59,623
- Come here. I have to tell you something.
- Huh?

1164
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:02,459
- I have to tell you something.
- Oh.

1165
01:22:02,501 --> 01:22:04,461
Well-

1166
01:22:18,978 --> 01:22:23,649
- It's not fair.
- What's not fair? What?

1167
01:22:23,691 --> 01:22:26,820
I've been here for four years,

1168
01:22:26,862 --> 01:22:30,323
and I've only just found you.

1169
01:22:30,365 --> 01:22:32,742
Well, you found me.

1170
01:22:44,547 --> 01:22:48,385
- Are you awake?
- No.

1171
01:22:49,678 --> 01:22:51,847
Yes, you are.

1172
01:22:59,397 --> 01:23:01,357
What?

1173
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:06,488
I want you to come
to California with me.

1174
01:23:11,243 --> 01:23:15,999
- You sure about that?
- Oh, yeah.

1175
01:23:16,082 --> 01:23:19,169
Yeah, but how do you know?

1176
01:23:19,252 --> 01:23:23,381
I don't know.
I just know.

1177
01:23:23,465 --> 01:23:26,219
Yeah, but how do you know?

1178
01:23:26,302 --> 01:23:29,388
I know because I feel it.

1179
01:23:29,430 --> 01:23:34,310
- Because that's a really serious thing you're saying.
- I know.

1180
01:23:34,393 --> 01:23:36,855
You could be in California
next week...

1181
01:23:36,939 --> 01:23:40,108
and you might find out
something about me you don't like.

1182
01:23:40,192 --> 01:23:42,236
Maybe you wish
you hadn't said that,

1183
01:23:42,319 --> 01:23:44,696
but you know it's such a serious thing
you can't take it back.

1184
01:23:44,780 --> 01:23:47,909
Now I'm stuck in California with someone
that doesn't really want to be with me,

1185
01:23:47,951 --> 01:23:52,497
- just wish they had a take-back.
- A what? What's a take-back?

1186
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:58,462
I don't want a take-back. I just want
you to come to California with me.

1187
01:23:58,546 --> 01:24:02,258
Well, I can't go to
California with you, so-

1188
01:24:03,342 --> 01:24:05,303
Why not?

1189
01:24:05,345 --> 01:24:09,474
Well, one, because
I got a job here.

1190
01:24:09,558 --> 01:24:12,811
And, two,
because I live here.

1191
01:24:12,894 --> 01:24:17,400
Look, um, if you don't love me,
you should just tell me.

1192
01:24:17,483 --> 01:24:19,402
I'm not sayin'
I don't love you.

1193
01:24:19,485 --> 01:24:24,657
Then why? Why won't you come?
What are you so scared of?

1194
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:27,661
What am I so scared of?

1195
01:24:27,703 --> 01:24:30,455
Well, what aren't
you scared of?

1196
01:24:30,539 --> 01:24:33,500
You live in this safe little world
where no one challenges you-

1197
01:24:33,584 --> 01:24:37,505
Don't tell me about my world.
Don't tell me about my world.

1198
01:24:37,547 --> 01:24:40,133
You just want to have your little fling
with the guy from the other side of town.

1199
01:24:40,174 --> 01:24:43,011
Then you're gonna go off to Stanford.
You're gonna marry some rich prick...

1200
01:24:43,094 --> 01:24:45,014
who your parents
will approve of...

1201
01:24:45,097 --> 01:24:47,099
and just sit around with
the other trust fund babies...

1202
01:24:47,182 --> 01:24:50,019
and talk about how you
went slummin', too, once.

1203
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:54,481
Why are you saying this?
What is your obsession with this money?

1204
01:24:54,523 --> 01:24:59,029
My father died when I was 13,
and I inherited this money.

1205
01:24:59,112 --> 01:25:04,534
You don't think every day I wake up,
and I wish I could give it back.

1206
01:25:04,576 --> 01:25:08,247
That I would give it back in a second if
it meant I could have one more day with him.

1207
01:25:08,331 --> 01:25:11,709
But I can't, and that's
my life, and I deal with it.

1208
01:25:11,792 --> 01:25:15,672
So don't put your shit on me
when you're the one that's afraid.

1209
01:25:15,714 --> 01:25:17,674
I'm afraid? What am I afraid of?
What the fuck am I afraid of?

1210
01:25:17,716 --> 01:25:20,260
You're afraid of me. You're afraid
that I won't love you back.

1211
01:25:20,344 --> 01:25:22,512
You know what?
I'm afraid too.

1212
01:25:22,596 --> 01:25:25,725
But fuck it, I want to give it a shot.
At least I'm honest with you.

1213
01:25:25,808 --> 01:25:29,646
- I'm not honest with you?
- No, what about your 12 brothers?

1214
01:25:29,729 --> 01:25:32,023
All right.

1215
01:25:32,106 --> 01:25:34,234
No, you're not going.
You're not leaving.

1216
01:25:34,317 --> 01:25:38,447
What do you want to know? That I don't
have 12 brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan?

1217
01:25:38,531 --> 01:25:40,574
- You don't want to hear that.
- I didn't know that.

1218
01:25:40,658 --> 01:25:43,869
You don't want to hear I got fuckin'
cigarettes put out on me when I was little.

1219
01:25:43,953 --> 01:25:46,373
- I didn't know that.
- That this isn't fuckin' surgery.

1220
01:25:46,414 --> 01:25:49,376
The motherfucker stabbed me. You don't
want to hear that shit, Skylar!

1221
01:25:49,417 --> 01:25:51,711
- I do want to hear that.
- Don't tell me you want that shit!

1222
01:25:51,795 --> 01:25:54,966
- I want to help you.
- Help me? What the fuck?

1223
01:25:55,049 --> 01:25:57,802
What do I got, a fuckin' sign
on my back that says, "Save me"?

1224
01:25:57,885 --> 01:25:59,804
- No.
- Do I look like I need that?

1225
01:25:59,887 --> 01:26:01,889
- No, I just want to be with you-
- Don't bullshit me!

1226
01:26:01,973 --> 01:26:05,978
- I love you.
- Don't bullshit me! Don't you fuckin' bullshit me!

1227
01:26:06,061 --> 01:26:08,981
I love you.

1228
01:26:09,064 --> 01:26:14,069
I want to hear you say
that you don't love me.

1229
01:26:14,152 --> 01:26:18,241
Because if you say that...

1230
01:26:18,324 --> 01:26:21,744
then I won't call you...

1231
01:26:21,786 --> 01:26:25,916
and I won't be in your life.

1232
01:26:29,753 --> 01:26:32,464
I don't love you.

1233
01:27:13,426 --> 01:27:17,640
Most people never get to see
how brilliant they can be.

1234
01:27:17,681 --> 01:27:20,476
They don't find teachers
that believe in them.

1235
01:27:20,517 --> 01:27:24,146
They get convinced
they're stupid.

1236
01:27:24,230 --> 01:27:27,192
I hope you appreciate
what he's doing,

1237
01:27:27,275 --> 01:27:30,612
because I've seen how much
he enjoys working with you,

1238
01:27:30,695 --> 01:27:33,657
not against you.

1239
01:27:36,869 --> 01:27:39,497
Hello, Will.

1240
01:27:39,539 --> 01:27:41,832
Tom, can you get us
some coffee?

1241
01:27:41,916 --> 01:27:43,876
Sure.

1242
01:27:47,381 --> 01:27:50,509
Now, let's see.

1243
01:27:55,473 --> 01:27:58,685
Good. This is correct.

1244
01:28:00,186 --> 01:28:02,564
I see you used Maclaurin here.

1245
01:28:02,647 --> 01:28:05,693
Yeah, I don't know what
you call it, but-

1246
01:28:05,776 --> 01:28:10,030
This can't be right.

1247
01:28:11,115 --> 01:28:14,034
This would be
very embarrassing.

1248
01:28:17,038 --> 01:28:20,083
- Did you ever consider-
- I'm pretty sure it's right.

1249
01:28:20,166 --> 01:28:22,335
Hey, look, can we do this
at Sean's office from now on?

1250
01:28:22,419 --> 01:28:26,549
Because I got to knock off work to come
here and the commute is killin' me.

1251
01:28:26,591 --> 01:28:30,219
- Yeah, sure. Did you think of
the possibility- - That's right.

1252
01:28:30,303 --> 01:28:35,517
It's right.
Just take it home with you.

1253
01:28:38,687 --> 01:28:40,647
What happened
at the McNeil meeting?

1254
01:28:40,731 --> 01:28:42,733
I couldn't go.
I had a date.

1255
01:28:42,774 --> 01:28:45,904
So I sent my
chief negotiator.

1256
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:53,453
On your own time, you can do
whatever you like, Will.

1257
01:28:53,536 --> 01:28:56,165
But when I set up a meeting
with my associates,

1258
01:28:56,248 --> 01:28:58,918
and you don't show up,
it reflects poorly on me.

1259
01:28:58,959 --> 01:29:01,170
- Then don't set up any more meetings.
- I won't.

1260
01:29:01,253 --> 01:29:03,672
I'll cancel 'em.

1261
01:29:03,756 --> 01:29:07,302
I'll give you a job myself. I just
wanted you to see what was out there.

1262
01:29:07,469 --> 01:29:10,555
Maybe I don't want to spend the rest of
my fuckin' life explainin' shit to people.

1263
01:29:17,647 --> 01:29:20,066
I think you could show me
some appreciation.

1264
01:29:20,149 --> 01:29:24,570
A little appreciation?
Do you know how easy this is for me?

1265
01:29:24,654 --> 01:29:27,950
Do you have any fuckin' idea how easy
this is? This is a fuckin' joke.

1266
01:29:28,033 --> 01:29:30,118
I'm sorry you can't do this-
I really am-

1267
01:29:30,202 --> 01:29:35,667
Because I wouldn't have to fuckin' sit here
and watch you fumble around and fuck it up.

1268
01:29:39,128 --> 01:29:42,757
Then you'd have more time to sit around
and get drunk instead, wouldn't you?

1269
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:47,429
You're right. This is probably
a total waste of my time.

1270
01:30:01,528 --> 01:30:03,655
You're right, Will.

1271
01:30:05,908 --> 01:30:10,496
I can't do this proof,
but you can.

1272
01:30:10,580 --> 01:30:14,625
And when it comes to that, it's only about
just a handful of people in the world...

1273
01:30:14,709 --> 01:30:16,837
who can tell the difference
between you and me.

1274
01:30:16,878 --> 01:30:19,172
- But I'm one of them.
- Sorry.

1275
01:30:19,214 --> 01:30:21,300
Yeah, so am I.

1276
01:30:21,383 --> 01:30:26,514
Most days I wish
I never met you,

1277
01:30:26,598 --> 01:30:29,225
because then I could
sleep at night.

1278
01:30:29,309 --> 01:30:35,190
I didn't have to walk around with the knowledge
that there was someone like you out there.

1279
01:30:41,572 --> 01:30:45,994
I didn't have to watch you
throw it all away.

1280
01:30:52,167 --> 01:30:57,548
Bill, hold it. Did you hear that?

1281
01:30:57,590 --> 01:30:59,550
Morgan!

1282
01:30:59,592 --> 01:31:05,057
If you're watchin' pornos in my mom's room
again, I'm gonna give you a fuckin' beatin'!

1283
01:31:20,990 --> 01:31:24,035
What's up, fellas?

1284
01:31:24,118 --> 01:31:28,707
Morgan, why don't you jerk off in your
own fuckin' house. That's fuckin' filthy.

1285
01:31:28,791 --> 01:31:32,920
I don't have a V.C.R.
In my house.

1286
01:31:33,003 --> 01:31:35,674
Come on. Not in my glove.

1287
01:31:35,757 --> 01:31:38,134
I didn't use the glove.

1288
01:31:38,218 --> 01:31:41,735
That's my
Little League glove.

1289
01:31:41,818 --> 01:31:45,240
What do you want me
to do?

1290
01:31:45,323 --> 01:31:47,450
I mean, what's wrong
with you?

1291
01:31:47,534 --> 01:31:49,702
You'll hump
a baseball glove?

1292
01:31:49,786 --> 01:31:52,914
I-I just used it
for cleanup.

1293
01:31:52,997 --> 01:31:56,710
Stop jerkin' off in my mother's room.

1294
01:31:56,794 --> 01:31:59,922
- Is there another V.C.R. In the house?
- It's just sad, bro.

1295
01:32:01,674 --> 01:32:06,555
So why do you think I should work
for the National Security Agency?

1296
01:32:06,638 --> 01:32:09,724
Well, you'd be working
on the cutting edge.

1297
01:32:09,808 --> 01:32:13,186
You'd be exposed to the kind of
technology you wouldn't see anywhere else,

1298
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:15,856
because we've classified it.

1299
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:19,610
Superstring theory,
chaos math, advanced algorithms.

1300
01:32:19,652 --> 01:32:22,613
Code breaking.

1301
01:32:22,655 --> 01:32:25,450
That's one aspect
of what we do.

1302
01:32:25,534 --> 01:32:28,161
Oh, come on.
That is what you do.

1303
01:32:28,245 --> 01:32:30,664
You guys handle 80% of
the intelligence workload.

1304
01:32:30,747 --> 01:32:33,250
You're seven times
the size of the C.I.A.

1305
01:32:33,333 --> 01:32:39,132
We don't like to brag about that, Will,
but you're exactly right.

1306
01:32:39,215 --> 01:32:43,094
So the way I see it,
the question isn't:

1307
01:32:43,177 --> 01:32:45,806
"Why should you work
for the N.S.A.?"

1308
01:32:45,890 --> 01:32:48,350
The question is:
"Why shouldn't you?"

1309
01:32:48,434 --> 01:32:52,313
Why shouldn't
I work for the N.S.A.?

1310
01:32:52,396 --> 01:32:56,318
That's a tough one,
but I'll take a shot.

1311
01:32:56,401 --> 01:32:59,154
Say I'm workin' at the N.S.A.
And somebody puts a code on my desk.

1312
01:32:59,195 --> 01:33:01,156
Something no one else
can break.

1313
01:33:01,197 --> 01:33:03,158
Maybe I take a shot at it
and maybe I break it.

1314
01:33:03,199 --> 01:33:05,745
I'm real happy with myself
because I did my job well.

1315
01:33:05,828 --> 01:33:09,373
But maybe that code was the location of some
rebel army in North Africa or Middle East.

1316
01:33:09,457 --> 01:33:12,501
Once they have that location, they bomb
the village where the rebels are hidin'.

1317
01:33:12,585 --> 01:33:16,840
Fifteen hundred people that I never met,
never had no problem with, get killed.

1318
01:33:16,882 --> 01:33:19,885
Now the politicians are saying, "Send in
the Marines to secure the area,"

1319
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:21,845
'cause they don't give a shit.

1320
01:33:21,929 --> 01:33:23,847
It won't be their kid
over there gettin' shot,

1321
01:33:23,931 --> 01:33:26,893
just like it wasn't them when their number got
called 'cause they were in the National Guard.

1322
01:33:26,976 --> 01:33:29,854
It'll be some kid from Southie
over there takin' shrapnel in the ass.

1323
01:33:29,896 --> 01:33:31,898
He comes back to find the plant
he used to work at...

1324
01:33:31,981 --> 01:33:34,442
got exported to the country
he got back from,

1325
01:33:34,525 --> 01:33:36,862
and the guy who put the shrapnel
in his ass got his old job...

1326
01:33:36,904 --> 01:33:39,782
'cause he'll work for 15 cents
a day and no bathroom breaks.

1327
01:33:39,865 --> 01:33:42,451
Meanwhile, he realizes the only reason
he was over there in the first place...

1328
01:33:42,534 --> 01:33:45,664
was so we could install a government
that would sell us oil at a good price.

1329
01:33:45,705 --> 01:33:49,751
Of course, the oil companies used a skirmish
over there to scare up domestic oil prices.

1330
01:33:49,834 --> 01:33:53,922
A cute little ancillary benefit for them, but
it ain't helpin' my buddy at 2.50 a gallon.

1331
01:33:54,005 --> 01:33:56,342
They're takin' their sweet time
bringin' the oil, of course.

1332
01:33:56,425 --> 01:33:58,553
Maybe they even took the liberty
to hire an alcoholic skipper,

1333
01:33:58,594 --> 01:34:01,806
who likes to drink martinis and fuckin'
play slalom with the icebergs.

1334
01:34:01,889 --> 01:34:04,141
It ain't too long till
he hits one, spills the oil...

1335
01:34:04,225 --> 01:34:06,687
and kills all the sea life
in the North Atlantic.

1336
01:34:06,728 --> 01:34:09,064
So now my buddy's out of work,
he can't afford to drive,

1337
01:34:09,106 --> 01:34:11,066
so he's walkin' to
the fuckin' job interviews...

1338
01:34:11,108 --> 01:34:13,902
which sucks because the shrapnel in his
ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids.

1339
01:34:13,944 --> 01:34:16,489
Meanwhile, he's starvin', 'cause every
time he tries to get a bite to eat,

1340
01:34:16,573 --> 01:34:18,491
the only blue plate special
they're servin'...

1341
01:34:18,575 --> 01:34:21,494
is North Atlantic scrod
with Quaker State.

1342
01:34:21,578 --> 01:34:26,584
So what did I think?
I'm holdin' out for somethin' better.

1343
01:34:26,667 --> 01:34:30,504
I figure, fuck it. While I'm at it,
why not just shoot my buddy,

1344
01:34:30,588 --> 01:34:32,506
take his job,
give it to his sworn enemy,

1345
01:34:32,590 --> 01:34:35,093
hike up gas prices, bomb
a village, club a baby seal,

1346
01:34:35,176 --> 01:34:37,846
hit the hash pipe
and join the National Guard?

1347
01:34:37,929 --> 01:34:40,473
I can be
elected president.

1348
01:34:40,557 --> 01:34:43,810
- You feel like you're alone?
- What?

1349
01:34:43,894 --> 01:34:47,523
Do you have a soul mate?

1350
01:34:47,607 --> 01:34:50,109
Do I have a-
Define that.

1351
01:34:50,192 --> 01:34:52,111
Somebody who challenges you.

1352
01:34:52,194 --> 01:34:58,076
- Uh, Chuckie.
- No, Chuckie's family. He'd lie down in fuckin' traffic for you.

1353
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:03,790
I'm talking about someone who opens
up things for you, touches your soul.

1354
01:35:03,874 --> 01:35:07,045
- I got- I got-
- Who?

1355
01:35:07,128 --> 01:35:10,173
- I got plenty.
- Well, name 'em.

1356
01:35:10,256 --> 01:35:13,259
Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Frost,
O'Connor, Kant, Pope, Locke-

1357
01:35:13,343 --> 01:35:15,554
That's great.
They're all dead.

1358
01:35:15,638 --> 01:35:18,766
- Not to me they're not.
- You don't have a lot of dialogue with them.

1359
01:35:18,807 --> 01:35:22,228
You can't give back
to them, Will.

1360
01:35:22,311 --> 01:35:26,650
- Not without some serious smelling salts and a heater.
- That's what I'm saying.

1361
01:35:26,733 --> 01:35:30,278
You'll never have that kind
of relationship in a world...

1362
01:35:30,362 --> 01:35:32,822
where you're always afraid
to take the first step,

1363
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:36,661
because all you see is every
negative thing ten miles down the road.

1364
01:35:36,744 --> 01:35:38,788
- You gonna take the professor's side on this?
- Don't give me a line of shit.

1365
01:35:38,829 --> 01:35:40,790
- No.
- I didn't want the job.

1366
01:35:40,831 --> 01:35:42,833
It's not about the job. I don't care
if you work for the government.

1367
01:35:42,875 --> 01:35:46,004
But you can do anything you want.
You are bound by nothing.

1368
01:35:46,088 --> 01:35:51,134
What are you passionate about?
What do you want?

1369
01:35:51,218 --> 01:35:53,554
There are guys who work
their entire life layin' brick...

1370
01:35:53,637 --> 01:35:55,890
so their kids have a chance
at the opportunities you have here.

1371
01:35:55,974 --> 01:35:58,476
- I didn't ask for this.
- No.

1372
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:01,020
You were born with it, so don't cop out
behind: "I didn't ask for this."

1373
01:36:01,062 --> 01:36:04,858
- What do you mean, cop out? What's wrong with layin' brick?
- Nothing.

1374
01:36:04,942 --> 01:36:07,236
There's nothin' wrong.
That's somebody's home I'm buildin'.

1375
01:36:07,319 --> 01:36:10,197
Right. My dad
laid brick, okay?

1376
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:12,199
Busted his ass so
I could have an education.

1377
01:36:12,241 --> 01:36:14,451
Exactly. That's
an honorable profession.

1378
01:36:14,535 --> 01:36:16,454
What's wrong with
fixin' somebody's car?

1379
01:36:16,538 --> 01:36:18,456
Someone will get to work the next day
because of me. That's honor in that.

1380
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:20,458
Yeah, there is, Will.
There is honor in that.

1381
01:36:20,542 --> 01:36:22,877
There's honor in takin'
that 40-minute train ride...

1382
01:36:22,919 --> 01:36:25,423
so those college kids could come in in
the morning and their floors are clean.

1383
01:36:25,506 --> 01:36:28,509
- And their wastebaskets are empty. That's real work.
- That's right.

1384
01:36:28,593 --> 01:36:31,596
And that's honorable. I'm sure
that's why you took that job.

1385
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:33,681
I mean, for the honor of it.

1386
01:36:33,764 --> 01:36:38,395
I just have a little question here.
You could be a janitor anywhere.

1387
01:36:38,478 --> 01:36:42,190
Why did you work at the most prestigious
technical college in the whole fuckin' world?

1388
01:36:42,274 --> 01:36:45,570
Why did you sneak around at night
and finish other people's formulas...

1389
01:36:45,612 --> 01:36:51,534
that only one or two people in the world
could do and then lie about it?

1390
01:36:51,618 --> 01:36:54,579
'Cause I don't see
a lot of honor in that, Will.

1391
01:36:57,791 --> 01:37:00,419
So what do you
really wanna do?

1392
01:37:03,797 --> 01:37:05,800
I wanna be a shepherd.

1393
01:37:05,926 --> 01:37:07,719
Really?

1394
01:37:07,802 --> 01:37:11,765
I wanna move up to Nashua, get a nice little
spread, get some sheep and tend to them.

1395
01:37:11,848 --> 01:37:14,768
- Maybe you should go do that.
- What?

1396
01:37:14,852 --> 01:37:17,813
You know, if you're gonna jerk off, why don't
you just do it at home with a moist towel?

1397
01:37:17,855 --> 01:37:19,857
- You're chuckin' me?
- Yeah, get the fuck outta here.

1398
01:37:19,899 --> 01:37:21,859
- No, no, no, time's not up yet.
- Yeah, it is.

1399
01:37:21,943 --> 01:37:24,612
- I'm not leavin'. No.
- You're not gonna answer, you're wastin' my time.

1400
01:37:24,695 --> 01:37:26,657
I thought we were friends.

1401
01:37:26,698 --> 01:37:30,327
- Playtime's over, okay?
- Why are you kickin' me out?

1402
01:37:30,410 --> 01:37:33,747
You're lecturin' me on life?
Look at you, you fuckin' burnout.

1403
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:36,042
- What winds your clock?
- Workin' with you.

1404
01:37:36,125 --> 01:37:39,212
Where's your soul mate? You wanna
talk about soul mates? Where is she?

1405
01:37:39,295 --> 01:37:41,422
- Dead.
- That's right. She's fuckin' dead.

1406
01:37:41,506 --> 01:37:44,217
She fuckin' dies and you just cash in
your chips and you walk away?

1407
01:37:44,300 --> 01:37:48,514
- At least I played a hand.
- You played a hand and you lost. You lost a big fuckin' hand.

1408
01:37:48,555 --> 01:37:51,976
Some people will lose a big hand like
that and have the sack to ante up again.

1409
01:37:52,059 --> 01:37:55,146
Look at me.
What do you wanna do?

1410
01:38:02,070 --> 01:38:06,325
You and your bullshit.
You got a bullshit answer for everybody.

1411
01:38:06,409 --> 01:38:10,121
But I ask you a very simple question and
you can't give me a straight answer,

1412
01:38:10,204 --> 01:38:14,166
because you don't know.

1413
01:38:15,836 --> 01:38:18,046
I'll see ya, Bo-peep.

1414
01:38:21,008 --> 01:38:23,135
- Fuck you.
- You're the shepherd.

1415
01:38:27,890 --> 01:38:30,101
Shepherd.

1416
01:38:30,184 --> 01:38:32,270
White little prick.

1417
01:38:33,521 --> 01:38:35,482
I just wanted to,
you know, um,

1418
01:38:35,566 --> 01:38:39,069
call you up,
uh, before you left, um-

1419
01:38:39,111 --> 01:38:41,739
I've been takin' all these
jobs interviews and stuff,

1420
01:38:41,822 --> 01:38:43,782
so I'm not gonna be just
a construction worker.

1421
01:38:43,824 --> 01:38:46,536
Well, you know, I never
really cared about that.

1422
01:38:48,038 --> 01:38:49,998
Yeah.

1423
01:38:52,584 --> 01:38:54,502
I love you.

1424
01:38:58,841 --> 01:39:01,344
Will?

1425
01:39:01,427 --> 01:39:04,263
You take care.

1426
01:40:15,134 --> 01:40:17,845
Will, come on.
Will!

1427
01:40:19,888 --> 01:40:22,016
Will, that's it!
We're done!

1428
01:40:22,057 --> 01:40:26,813
I'm sitting in your office
and the boy isn't here.

1429
01:40:26,896 --> 01:40:28,898
Well, it's ten past 5:00.

1430
01:40:28,982 --> 01:40:31,026
An hour and
ten minutes late.

1431
01:40:34,487 --> 01:40:37,992
Well, if he doesn't show up and I file
a report saying he wasn't here...

1432
01:40:38,075 --> 01:40:41,954
and he goes back to jail,
he won't be on my conscience.

1433
01:40:44,958 --> 01:40:47,961
Okay. Fine.

1434
01:40:49,504 --> 01:40:52,299
What's up?

1435
01:40:53,383 --> 01:40:55,303
Thanks.

1436
01:40:57,931 --> 01:41:01,851
Ah! God, that's good.

1437
01:41:05,648 --> 01:41:08,150
So how's your lady?

1438
01:41:08,233 --> 01:41:11,070
Ah, she's gone.

1439
01:41:11,111 --> 01:41:13,447
Gone? Gone where?

1440
01:41:13,530 --> 01:41:17,202
Med school.
Medical school in California.

1441
01:41:17,285 --> 01:41:19,204
- Really?
- Yeah.

1442
01:41:19,287 --> 01:41:22,249
- When was this?
- It was, like, a week ago.

1443
01:41:26,629 --> 01:41:28,547
That sucks.

1444
01:41:31,550 --> 01:41:35,097
So, uh, when are you done
with those meetings?

1445
01:41:35,138 --> 01:41:37,182
I think the week
after I'm 21.

1446
01:41:37,266 --> 01:41:39,977
They gonna hook ya up
with a job or what?

1447
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:44,273
Yeah, fuckin' sit in a room and do
long division for the next 50 years.

1448
01:41:44,356 --> 01:41:47,777
Nah, probably make
some nice bank though.

1449
01:41:47,819 --> 01:41:49,821
I'm gonna be
a fuckin' lab rat.

1450
01:41:49,862 --> 01:41:53,241
Better than this shit.
Way outta here.

1451
01:41:53,324 --> 01:41:55,536
What do I want a way
outta here for?

1452
01:41:55,619 --> 01:41:57,871
I mean, I'm gonna fuckin'
live here the rest of my life.

1453
01:41:57,955 --> 01:42:00,040
You know, be neighbors.
You know, have little kids.

1454
01:42:00,124 --> 01:42:04,712
Fuckin' take 'em to Little League
together up Foley Field.

1455
01:42:06,298 --> 01:42:09,676
Look, you're my best friend,
so don't take this the wrong way.

1456
01:42:09,759 --> 01:42:12,679
But in 20 years if
you're still livin' here,

1457
01:42:12,721 --> 01:42:15,975
comin' over to my house
to watch the Patriots games,

1458
01:42:16,058 --> 01:42:18,352
still workin' construction,
I'll fuckin' kill ya.

1459
01:42:18,436 --> 01:42:20,980
That's not a threat. That's a fact.
I'll fuckin' kill ya.

1460
01:42:21,063 --> 01:42:23,232
What the fuck
are you talkin' about?

1461
01:42:23,316 --> 01:42:26,486
- Look, you got something none of us have.
- Oh, come on!

1462
01:42:26,570 --> 01:42:30,449
Why is it always this? I fuckin'
owe it to myself to do this or that.

1463
01:42:30,532 --> 01:42:34,661
- What if I don't want to?
- No, no, no. Fuck you. You don't owe it to yourself.

1464
01:42:34,745 --> 01:42:36,998
You owe it to me,

1465
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:39,626
'cause tomorrow I'm gonna
wake up and I'll be 50,

1466
01:42:39,709 --> 01:42:42,170
and I'll still
be doin' this shit.

1467
01:42:42,253 --> 01:42:44,797
That's all right.
That's fine.

1468
01:42:44,882 --> 01:42:47,468
I mean, you're sittin' on
a winnin' lottery ticket.

1469
01:42:47,551 --> 01:42:51,221
You're too much of a pussy
to cash it in, and that's bullshit.

1470
01:42:53,265 --> 01:42:56,186
'Cause I'd do fuckin' anything
to have what you got.

1471
01:42:56,227 --> 01:42:59,105
So would any of
these fuckin' guys.

1472
01:42:59,189 --> 01:43:01,858
Be an insult to us
if you're still here in 20 years.

1473
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:04,486
Hangin' around here
is a fuckin' waste of your time.

1474
01:43:04,569 --> 01:43:06,697
- You don't know that.
- I don't?

1475
01:43:06,739 --> 01:43:10,242
- No. You don't know that.
- Oh, I don't know that. Let me tell you what I do know.

1476
01:43:10,326 --> 01:43:14,205
Every day I come by your house,
and I pick you up.

1477
01:43:14,246 --> 01:43:18,251
We go out and have a few drinks
and few laughs, and it's great.

1478
01:43:18,335 --> 01:43:21,046
You know what the
best part of my day is?

1479
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:25,510
It's for about ten seconds: From when I pull
up to the curb and when I get to your door.

1480
01:43:25,593 --> 01:43:30,265
'Cause I think maybe I'll get up there and
I'll knock on the door and you won't be there.

1481
01:43:30,348 --> 01:43:33,810
No "good-bye," no "see ya later."
No nothing. You just left.

1482
01:43:33,893 --> 01:43:38,190
I don't know much,
but I know that.

1483
01:43:50,537 --> 01:43:53,039
This is a disaster, Sean.

1484
01:43:53,123 --> 01:43:55,501
I brought you in here because
I wanted you to help me with the boy,

1485
01:43:55,543 --> 01:43:57,545
- not to run him out.
- I know what I'm doing with the boy.

1486
01:43:57,628 --> 01:43:59,588
I don't care if you have
a rapport with the boy!

1487
01:43:59,672 --> 01:44:02,300
I don't care if you have a few laughs,
even at my expense.

1488
01:44:02,383 --> 01:44:05,137
- But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
- Undermine?

1489
01:44:05,220 --> 01:44:07,264
This boy is at
a fragile point right now.

1490
01:44:07,347 --> 01:44:10,350
I do understand. He is at
a fragile point. He's got problems.

1491
01:44:10,392 --> 01:44:13,979
What problems does he have? That he's
better off as a janitor, in jail?

1492
01:44:14,062 --> 01:44:17,150
Better hanging out with
a bunch of retarded gorillas?

1493
01:44:17,233 --> 01:44:21,195
Why do you think he does that?
You have any fuckin' clue why?

1494
01:44:21,279 --> 01:44:24,824
He can handle the problems. He can
handle the work. He obviously handled you.

1495
01:44:24,908 --> 01:44:27,453
Listen to me.
Why is he hiding?

1496
01:44:27,536 --> 01:44:29,455
Why doesn't
he trust anybody?

1497
01:44:29,538 --> 01:44:31,457
Because the first thing
that happened to him,

1498
01:44:31,540 --> 01:44:33,459
he was abandoned by the people
who were supposed to love him the most.

1499
01:44:33,542 --> 01:44:35,545
Don't give me
that Freudian crap.

1500
01:44:35,629 --> 01:44:37,964
Why does he hang out with those
retarded gorillas, as you call them?

1501
01:44:38,048 --> 01:44:41,635
Because any one of them, if he asked
them to, would take a bat to your head.

1502
01:44:41,718 --> 01:44:44,638
- That's called loyalty.
- Yeah, that's very touching.

1503
01:44:44,721 --> 01:44:47,892
Who's he handling? He pushes people away
before they have a chance to leave him.

1504
01:44:47,933 --> 01:44:50,478
It's a defense mechanism,
all right?

1505
01:44:50,561 --> 01:44:53,272
For 20 years, he's been
alone because of that.

1506
01:44:53,356 --> 01:44:56,026
If you push him right now, it's gonna
be the same thing all over again.

1507
01:44:56,109 --> 01:44:58,028
I'm not gonna
let that happen to him.

1508
01:44:58,111 --> 01:45:00,030
- Don't you do that.
- What?

1509
01:45:00,113 --> 01:45:03,909
Don't infect him with the idea that it's
okay to quit, that it's okay to be a failure.

1510
01:45:03,951 --> 01:45:05,912
Because it's not okay, Sean!

1511
01:45:05,954 --> 01:45:09,749
And if you're angry at me for being
successful, for being what you could have been-

1512
01:45:09,832 --> 01:45:12,669
- I'm not angry at you.
- Oh, yes, you're angry at me.

1513
01:45:12,752 --> 01:45:16,882
You resent me, but I'm not gonna
apologize for any success I've had.

1514
01:45:16,966 --> 01:45:19,718
You're angry at me for doing
what you could have done!

1515
01:45:19,802 --> 01:45:21,929
But ask yourself, Sean-
Ask yourself...

1516
01:45:21,971 --> 01:45:25,392
if you want Will to feel that way-
if you want him to feel like a failure?

1517
01:45:25,475 --> 01:45:27,477
You arrogant shit!

1518
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:32,065
That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions,
'cause I can't stand that look in your eye.

1519
01:45:32,148 --> 01:45:35,152
- That condescending, embarrassed look.
- Oh, come on, Sean.

1520
01:45:35,236 --> 01:45:37,238
You think I'm a failure.
I know who I am.

1521
01:45:37,321 --> 01:45:41,784
I'm proud of what I do. It was
a conscious choice. I didn't fuck up!

1522
01:45:41,867 --> 01:45:44,620
And you and your cronies think
I'm some sort of pity case.

1523
01:45:44,662 --> 01:45:48,292
You and your kiss-ass chorus following
you around going, "The Field's medal!"

1524
01:45:48,375 --> 01:45:51,712
Why are you still so
fuckin' afraid of failure?

1525
01:45:51,795 --> 01:45:55,883
It's about my medal, isn't it? Oh, God, I could
go home and get it for you. You can have it.

1526
01:45:55,967 --> 01:45:58,928
Shove the medal up
your fuckin' ass, all right?

1527
01:45:59,012 --> 01:46:01,014
'Cause I don't give
a shit about your medal,

1528
01:46:01,097 --> 01:46:03,057
because I knew you before
you were a mathematical god,

1529
01:46:03,141 --> 01:46:06,770
when you were pimple-faced and homesick and
didn't know what side of the bed to piss on.

1530
01:46:06,854 --> 01:46:08,814
Yeah, you were smarter than me then
and you're smarter than me now.

1531
01:46:08,897 --> 01:46:10,858
So don't blame me for
how your life turned out.

1532
01:46:10,899 --> 01:46:13,319
I don't blame you!
It's not about you!

1533
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:16,156
You mathematical dick!
It's about the boy!

1534
01:46:16,197 --> 01:46:21,202
He's a good kid! And I won't see you fuck him
up like you're tryin' to fuck up me right now.

1535
01:46:21,286 --> 01:46:23,788
I won't see you make him
feel like a failure too!

1536
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:27,335
- He won't be a failure!
- But if you push him! If you ride him!

1537
01:46:27,418 --> 01:46:33,090
I am what I am today because I was pushed
and because I learned to push myself.

1538
01:46:33,174 --> 01:46:35,218
He's not you!
You get that!

1539
01:46:37,346 --> 01:46:39,181
I can come back.

1540
01:46:39,264 --> 01:46:43,352
No, come in.
Uh, I was just leaving.

1541
01:46:53,571 --> 01:46:57,493
A lot of that stuff goes back
a long way between me and him.

1542
01:46:57,576 --> 01:46:59,620
You know. Not about you.

1543
01:47:02,748 --> 01:47:06,378
What is that?

1544
01:47:06,419 --> 01:47:10,757
This is your file. I have to send it
back to the judge for evaluation.

1545
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:15,972
Oh. Hey, you're not
gonna fail me, are you?

1546
01:47:19,642 --> 01:47:21,852
What's it say?

1547
01:47:23,229 --> 01:47:25,899
- Wanna read it?
- Why?

1548
01:47:27,609 --> 01:47:30,821
Have you had any, uh,
experience with that?

1549
01:47:30,904 --> 01:47:34,491
Twenty years of counseling.
Yeah, I've seen some pretty awful shit.

1550
01:47:34,574 --> 01:47:38,913
I mean, have you had
any experience with that?

1551
01:47:42,917 --> 01:47:46,422
- Personally?
- Yeah.

1552
01:47:46,505 --> 01:47:48,465
Yeah, I have.

1553
01:47:48,507 --> 01:47:50,551
It sure ain't good.

1554
01:47:53,971 --> 01:47:56,099
My father was an alcoholic.

1555
01:47:56,141 --> 01:47:58,977
Mean fuckin' drunk.

1556
01:48:00,603 --> 01:48:03,606
He'd come home hammered,
lookin' to whale on somebody.

1557
01:48:03,648 --> 01:48:08,195
So I'd provoke him so he wouldn't go
after my mother and little brother.

1558
01:48:08,279 --> 01:48:12,450
Interesting nights
when he wore his rings.

1559
01:48:13,492 --> 01:48:16,955
He used to just
put a wrench,

1560
01:48:17,039 --> 01:48:19,791
a stick and a belt
on the table.

1561
01:48:19,868 --> 01:48:23,892
- Just say, "Choose."
- Well, I gotta go with the belt there.

1562
01:48:23,976 --> 01:48:25,937
I used to go with the wrench.

1563
01:48:25,979 --> 01:48:27,981
Why the wrench?

1564
01:48:28,064 --> 01:48:30,442
'Cause fuck him, that's why.

1565
01:48:30,483 --> 01:48:34,112
- Your foster father?
- Yeah.

1566
01:48:34,154 --> 01:48:38,075
So, uh, what is it, like,
Will has an attachment disorder?

1567
01:48:38,159 --> 01:48:40,453
Is it all that stuff?

1568
01:48:40,536 --> 01:48:43,456
Fear of abandonment?

1569
01:48:43,497 --> 01:48:46,543
Is that why I broke up
with Skylar?

1570
01:48:46,627 --> 01:48:49,963
- I didn't know you had.
- Yeah, I did.

1571
01:48:50,005 --> 01:48:53,967
- You wanna talk about it?
- No.

1572
01:48:56,179 --> 01:49:02,018
Hey, Will,
I don't know a lot.

1573
01:49:02,101 --> 01:49:05,522
You see this?
All this shit?

1574
01:49:10,527 --> 01:49:12,613
It's not your fault.

1575
01:49:14,908 --> 01:49:17,077
Yeah, I know that.

1576
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:20,121
Look at me, son.

1577
01:49:20,205 --> 01:49:23,708
- It's not your fault.
- I know.

1578
01:49:23,792 --> 01:49:28,422
No. It's not
your fault.

1579
01:49:28,506 --> 01:49:30,424
I know.

1580
01:49:30,508 --> 01:49:35,013
No, no, you don't.
It's not your fault.

1581
01:49:35,097 --> 01:49:37,057
- Hmm?
- I know.

1582
01:49:37,140 --> 01:49:39,851
- It's not your fault.
- All right.

1583
01:49:39,935 --> 01:49:42,396
It's not your fault.

1584
01:49:44,273 --> 01:49:49,529
- It's not your fault.
- Don't fuck with me.

1585
01:49:49,612 --> 01:49:51,990
It's not your fault.

1586
01:49:52,073 --> 01:49:55,619
Don't fuck with me, all right?
Don't fuck with me, Sean, not you.

1587
01:49:55,703 --> 01:49:58,247
It's not your fault.

1588
01:50:03,460 --> 01:50:07,549
It's not your fault.

1589
01:50:13,763 --> 01:50:16,892
My God-

1590
01:50:16,934 --> 01:50:21,564
My God! I'm so sorry!
My God!

1591
01:50:35,788 --> 01:50:37,915
Fuck them, okay?

1592
01:52:04,010 --> 01:52:08,098
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm Will Hunting. I'm here about a position.

1593
01:52:08,181 --> 01:52:10,600
Could you just have
a seat for a moment?

1594
01:52:14,187 --> 01:52:17,567
Yes, there's
a Mr. Hunting in the lobby.

1595
01:52:37,589 --> 01:52:39,674
Which one did you take?

1596
01:52:39,758 --> 01:52:44,679
I was over at McNeil. It's one of
the jobs the professor set me up with.

1597
01:52:44,763 --> 01:52:49,143
I haven't told him yet, but I went
down there and talked to my boss-

1598
01:52:49,185 --> 01:52:52,647
My new boss.
He seemed like a good guy.

1599
01:52:52,688 --> 01:52:58,111
- Is that what you want?
- Yeah, you know, I think so.

1600
01:52:58,195 --> 01:53:01,198
Well, good for you.
Congratulations.

1601
01:53:01,281 --> 01:53:03,200
Thanks.

1602
01:53:06,287 --> 01:53:08,206
Time's up.

1603
01:53:11,167 --> 01:53:14,420
So that's- So that's it?
So we're done?

1604
01:53:14,504 --> 01:53:17,299
Yeah, that's it.

1605
01:53:17,383 --> 01:53:20,219
You're done.
You're a free man.

1606
01:53:21,512 --> 01:53:26,226
Well, um, I just want you
to know, Sean, that-

1607
01:53:26,309 --> 01:53:28,311
You're welcome, Will.

1608
01:53:33,441 --> 01:53:36,487
So, you know, I hope
we keep in touch, you know.

1609
01:53:36,570 --> 01:53:39,031
Yeah, me too.

1610
01:53:39,115 --> 01:53:41,742
I'll be travelin' around a bit.
It'll be a little hard, but, uh-

1611
01:53:41,826 --> 01:53:45,539
I've got an answering machine at
the college I'll be checking in with.

1612
01:53:45,580 --> 01:53:49,418
So, here's the number.

1613
01:53:49,501 --> 01:53:53,380
You call that.
I'll get back to you right away.

1614
01:53:53,422 --> 01:53:56,551
Yeah, you know,
I figured I'm just gonna...

1615
01:53:56,592 --> 01:54:01,180
put my money back on the table
and see what kind of cards I get.

1616
01:54:02,432 --> 01:54:05,436
You do what's in your heart,
son. You'll be fine.

1617
01:54:09,940 --> 01:54:12,109
- Thank you, Sean.
- Uh-

1618
01:54:12,192 --> 01:54:14,236
Thank you, Will.

1619
01:54:15,947 --> 01:54:19,242
Hey, does this violate
the patient-doctor relationship?

1620
01:54:19,326 --> 01:54:21,494
Naw. Only if you
grab my ass.

1621
01:54:25,291 --> 01:54:27,460
- Take care.
- You too.

1622
01:54:27,543 --> 01:54:29,462
Yeah.

1623
01:54:31,297 --> 01:54:33,299
Hey.

1624
01:54:33,382 --> 01:54:35,761
Good luck, son.

1625
01:54:46,856 --> 01:54:49,651
Two beers.

1626
01:54:52,362 --> 01:54:54,405
What's up?
Did you guys go?

1627
01:54:54,489 --> 01:54:56,825
No. I had to talk him down.

1628
01:54:56,909 --> 01:55:00,621
- Why didn't you yoke him?
- Little Morgan's got a lot of scrap to him.

1629
01:55:00,663 --> 01:55:02,623
People try to whip
his ass every week.

1630
01:55:02,665 --> 01:55:05,168
- Fuckin' kid won't back down.
- What are you sayin' about me?

1631
01:55:05,210 --> 01:55:08,713
- Was I talkin' to you?
None of your fuckin' business.

1632
01:55:08,797 --> 01:55:12,050
- Go get me a beer.
- I ordered two beers!

1633
01:55:12,133 --> 01:55:14,135
- Hey, asshole.
- What, bitch?

1634
01:55:14,177 --> 01:55:18,015
- Happy birthday.
- Thought we forgot, huh, bitch?

1635
01:55:18,099 --> 01:55:20,685
- Come on!
- I'm goin'. I'm goin'.

1636
01:55:20,768 --> 01:55:22,687
All right. Who's first?

1637
01:55:22,770 --> 01:55:25,190
- Come on, motherfucker!
- Who's first?

1638
01:55:27,275 --> 01:55:30,821
Here's your present.

1639
01:55:30,862 --> 01:55:32,864
- Come on, bro.
- What?

1640
01:55:32,948 --> 01:55:37,203
Well, we knew you had to get back and
forth to Cambridge for your new job.

1641
01:55:37,286 --> 01:55:41,165
I knew I wasn't gonna fuckin'
drive you every day, so-

1642
01:55:41,207 --> 01:55:45,295
- Morgan wanted to get you a "T" pass.
- That's not what I was sayin'!

1643
01:55:45,379 --> 01:55:47,840
But, uh, you're 21 now.

1644
01:55:47,923 --> 01:55:51,510
You're legally allowed to drink, so we
figured the best thing for ya was a car.

1645
01:55:51,552 --> 01:55:54,054
- How do you like it?
- This is like-

1646
01:55:56,516 --> 01:56:00,437
It's the ugliest fuckin' car
I've ever seen in my life.

1647
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:02,522
- Come on, brother.
- How'd you guys do this?

1648
01:56:02,605 --> 01:56:07,570
You know, me and Bill
scraped together the parts,

1649
01:56:07,611 --> 01:56:09,697
and Morgan was out panhandlin'
for change every day.

1650
01:56:09,739 --> 01:56:11,699
I had the router to do
all the bodywork.

1651
01:56:11,741 --> 01:56:13,701
Yeah, I have a fuckin' job,
too, brother.

1652
01:56:13,743 --> 01:56:16,204
Guy's been up my ass for two years about
a job. I had to let him help with the car.

1653
01:56:16,246 --> 01:56:18,332
So you finally got a job,
huh, Morgan?

1654
01:56:18,415 --> 01:56:20,625
- Yeah, had one. Now I'm fucked again.
- So what is it?

1655
01:56:20,709 --> 01:56:24,379
- A lawn mower? What do ya got?
- It's a straight fuckin' six.

1656
01:56:24,421 --> 01:56:26,382
Me and Bill rebuilt
this engine ourselves here.

1657
01:56:26,424 --> 01:56:29,510
It's a good car.
The engine's good. Engine's good.

1658
01:56:29,594 --> 01:56:32,972
- Happy 21, Will.
- Happy 21, brother.

1659
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:41,982
Hi.

1660
01:56:43,442 --> 01:56:45,487
Come on in.

1661
01:56:47,614 --> 01:56:49,574
Sean, I, um-

1662
01:56:49,616 --> 01:56:52,661
Me too, Gerry.

1663
01:56:52,744 --> 01:56:55,081
Yeah. Good.

1664
01:56:56,165 --> 01:56:58,292
I heard you're
takin' some time.

1665
01:56:58,376 --> 01:57:02,963
Yeah. Travel a little bit,
maybe write.

1666
01:57:03,047 --> 01:57:05,008
So where are you going?

1667
01:57:05,092 --> 01:57:09,096
India and China
and Baltimore.

1668
01:57:10,347 --> 01:57:12,432
Oh.

1669
01:57:12,474 --> 01:57:14,476
You know when
you'll be back?

1670
01:57:14,559 --> 01:57:17,981
Oh. I got this flyer
the other day.

1671
01:57:18,022 --> 01:57:20,858
It says, uh, class of '72
is having a reunion in six months.

1672
01:57:20,942 --> 01:57:22,860
Yeah, I got
one of those too.

1673
01:57:22,944 --> 01:57:24,863
Why don't you come?
I'll buy ya a drink.

1674
01:57:24,947 --> 01:57:27,825
The drinks at
those things are free.

1675
01:57:27,866 --> 01:57:31,370
I know, Gerry.
I was being ironical.

1676
01:57:35,750 --> 01:57:39,546
- Oh.
- How about a drink right now?

1677
01:57:39,629 --> 01:57:42,799
Yeah. It's a good idea.

1678
01:57:42,841 --> 01:57:45,219
Come on.
This one's on me.

1679
01:57:48,014 --> 01:57:50,349
- I got the winner right here, pal.
- Oh!

1680
01:57:50,433 --> 01:57:53,769
Yes, sir, this is the one.

1681
01:57:53,853 --> 01:57:56,148
This is my ticket
to paradise.

1682
01:57:56,231 --> 01:57:58,317
Do you know what the odds
are against winning the lottery?

1683
01:57:58,358 --> 01:58:01,403
- What? Four to one?
- About 30 million to one.

1684
01:58:01,486 --> 01:58:03,613
I still have a shot, you know?

1685
01:58:03,697 --> 01:58:09,537
Yes, just about as big chance as you being hit
by lightning here on the staircase right now.

1686
01:58:09,620 --> 01:58:12,874
It's a possibility too. I mean,
32 million. If you look at the size-

1687
01:59:42,347 --> 01:59:44,766
Will!

1688
02:00:03,787 --> 02:00:05,707
Will?

1689
02:01:12,947 --> 02:01:14,908
He's not there.

1690
02:01:35,973 --> 02:01:39,268
Sean, if
the professor calls about that job,

1691
02:01:39,309 --> 02:01:43,897
just tell him sorry,
I had to go see about a girl.

1692
02:01:43,981 --> 02:01:45,900
Will.

1693
02:01:47,485 --> 02:01:50,822
Son of a bitch.
He stole my line.
