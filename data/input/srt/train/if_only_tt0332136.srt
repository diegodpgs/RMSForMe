1
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,839
I'm really going to miss you,
you know that?

2
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:17,401
Sam, just couple of weeks.

3
00:02:17,923 --> 00:02:21,042
Which is gonna seem
like an eternity, right?

4
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,883
An eternity, and then some.

5
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,243
Oh, it's better, you
bloody englishman.

6
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:32,083
- Say it again.
- Say what?

7
00:02:32,242 --> 00:02:34,965
I love hearing you use english
swear words. Say 'bloody'.

8
00:02:35,124 --> 00:02:36,404
'Bloody'.

9
00:02:36,561 --> 00:02:38,603
- Say 'bugger',
- 'Bugger'.

10
00:02:38,764 --> 00:02:41,043
You bugger, you bloody bugger.

11
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:42,285
That's the word.

12
00:02:47,003 --> 00:02:48,884
- Oh, crap.
- Oh, you smooth talker, you.

13
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:51,685
I have to get dressed, run through
my notes, rehearse my presentation.

14
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:56,125
Have a nervous breakdown, ignore your
half-naked girlfriend. Give me two seconds.

15
00:02:56,245 --> 00:02:59,762
Just stay right there and don't
move your cute British butt.

16
00:02:59,924 --> 00:03:01,967
- Don't tell me, there's a gift.
- There's a gift.

17
00:03:02,124 --> 00:03:06,405
There's always a gift.
It makes me feel very guilty.

18
00:03:06,923 --> 00:03:09,085
Well, that is the general idea.

19
00:03:09,206 --> 00:03:12,926
I have a present, too. I'll give it
to you later because it's a surprise.

20
00:03:13,045 --> 00:03:15,327
Great. I love surprises.

21
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:22,525
- It's perfect.
- I know.

22
00:03:22,648 --> 00:03:24,928
Vintage Portobello Road,
it's only ten pounds.

23
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,969
And it does come with this.

24
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,610
Nice lining, silk.

25
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:41,530
What?

26
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:45,650
I have to get ready, you know
how important this meeting is.

27
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,769
If it goes well, you know
what that you could mean.

28
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:48,730
Ian...

29
00:03:49,732 --> 00:03:50,608
Sam,

30
00:03:52,647 --> 00:03:54,130
please have mercy.

31
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,572
You know, that's what I was thinking, that
after you close the deal and knock them dead...

32
00:03:58,692 --> 00:04:02,013
it would be a perfect time
to step back, relax, and...

33
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:05,094
- And?
- And go to Ohio.

34
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:11,412
I want you to go to my mom's wedding
with me. You can meet everyone.

35
00:04:15,413 --> 00:04:16,531
You're not coming?

36
00:04:18,854 --> 00:04:23,411
I tried to free things up but
you know how hectic work's been.

37
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,213
I'm really sorry.

38
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:30,254
That's okay.

39
00:04:35,093 --> 00:04:37,375
Look, I'm really sorry to
let you down about Indiana.

40
00:04:37,496 --> 00:04:38,891
Ohio.

41
00:04:39,016 --> 00:04:41,096
Bugger, I'm sorry, again.

42
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,895
I'm just going to have to meet
your mom at the next wedding.

43
00:04:44,012 --> 00:04:45,135
What wedding?

44
00:04:45,256 --> 00:04:47,413
Ours. Next year.

45
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,578
Me? Marry you?

46
00:04:49,696 --> 00:04:53,214
A guy who confuses the buckeye state
with the hoosier state? I don't think so.

47
00:04:54,014 --> 00:04:56,497
- I'm going to take a shower now.
- Be my guest.

48
00:05:08,337 --> 00:05:12,538
Sam?

49
00:05:16,977 --> 00:05:20,378
I am cool. Ready for breakfast?
Bon appetite.

50
00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:24,058
Hey, I don't care how big this
meeting is. You are going to eat.

51
00:05:24,178 --> 00:05:25,780
Sorry, there's no time.

52
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,218
Aw, I'm such a klutz.

53
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,182
Show me.

54
00:05:37,341 --> 00:05:39,500
- Better?
- Much.

55
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,499
Good.

56
00:05:52,821 --> 00:05:56,341
One day accessing one's genetic make-up
will be as easy as running a credit check.

57
00:05:56,463 --> 00:06:00,383
That knowledge gives us the power
to alter our destiny.

58
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:03,144
Alter destiny?
You believe that?

59
00:06:03,303 --> 00:06:06,225
Yeah, of course I do. I'm telling you,
in the next fifty years...

60
00:06:06,344 --> 00:06:08,062
People are still going to die.

61
00:06:08,185 --> 00:06:12,063
It'll still rain right after you wash your car,
and the stones will still be touring.

62
00:06:14,626 --> 00:06:18,706
That stuff's out of your control. The only
things you can control are your own choices.

63
00:06:19,707 --> 00:06:20,625
Okay.

64
00:06:20,743 --> 00:06:22,546
Well, that would be the
other point of view.

65
00:06:22,664 --> 00:06:25,904
But I don't have time to debate destiny.
I'm just practicing my speech.

66
00:06:26,022 --> 00:06:26,866
Excuse me.

67
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,906
In case we don't talk later,
dinner tonight. Tantra, seven o'clock.

68
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:33,387
Tonight, seven o'clock?
You're kidding, right?

69
00:06:33,546 --> 00:06:35,425
Kidding? Not that
I'm aware of.

70
00:06:36,306 --> 00:06:37,704
My concert.

71
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:41,949
The one I've been preparing for
for three years. Ring a bell?

72
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:45,350
Yeah. Your graduation concert.
I didn't forget that. That's...

73
00:06:45,468 --> 00:06:47,907
Tonight. Seven o'clock.

74
00:06:50,191 --> 00:06:51,267
I'm an ass.

75
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:58,386
I'm so sorry, Sam.
I can't believe I did that.

76
00:07:03,911 --> 00:07:08,749
Good luck. In your meeting.
Not that you need it. You'll be great.

77
00:07:12,911 --> 00:07:13,952
I'm sorry.

78
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,952
You've got to be kidding me.

79
00:07:24,354 --> 00:07:26,913
Oh no, the stupid jerk.

80
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:31,992
You know, don't be late. I'll take care
of this. See you tonight at the concert.

81
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,395
Concert? What concert?

82
00:07:35,593 --> 00:07:40,275
I was kidding. Kidding you see, because
it turns out I forgot the thing and...

83
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:44,391
Oh, this must be that british sense
of humor I keep hearing about.

84
00:07:46,271 --> 00:07:50,153
Okay.
I'll see you tonight.

85
00:08:01,235 --> 00:08:05,635
Gentlemen, we at AGS are not only
at the forefront of biotech...

86
00:08:05,756 --> 00:08:07,914
not the forefront,
the vanguard!

87
00:08:09,714 --> 00:08:10,636
Bollocks!

88
00:08:10,754 --> 00:08:11,675
What happened?

89
00:08:11,793 --> 00:08:13,236
I cracked it this morning.

90
00:08:13,354 --> 00:08:14,677
But it says eleven o'clock.

91
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,158
Well, the hands
must have moved.

92
00:08:17,278 --> 00:08:19,436
At least it'll be right
twice a day.

93
00:08:20,275 --> 00:08:21,078
Do me a favor.

94
00:08:21,994 --> 00:08:24,357
Call Tantra, push my
reservation to nine.

95
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:26,836
And have someone dash over to Harvey Nicks.
I need a present for Samantha...

96
00:08:26,997 --> 00:08:29,717
For Samantha's graduation concert.

97
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:30,958
How did you remember that?

98
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:33,955
I'm not sure, could be
because she told me.

99
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:38,598
She sent you an invitation which is on your desk,
we programmed the date into your palm...

100
00:08:38,717 --> 00:08:41,840
Okay, got it, got it.
Thanks.

101
00:08:41,997 --> 00:08:44,839
Anyway, I promised her a surprise.

102
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,237
So, how about a sweater?
Something cashmere?

103
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:49,441
Red! Red's her
favorite color.

104
00:08:49,558 --> 00:08:51,562
She's already got one.

105
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:54,801
A red cashmere sweater. She was
wearing it last time she was here.

106
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,238
She went on and on about
how much she loved it.

107
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:58,559
Really? Where was I?

108
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:00,680
Right next to her.

109
00:09:13,483 --> 00:09:16,121
'You have no idea... '

110
00:09:16,283 --> 00:09:19,759
'What I feel inside'

111
00:09:19,923 --> 00:09:23,041
'Hold me, babe'

112
00:09:42,003 --> 00:09:43,886
Sorry to make you pick me up
all the way over here.

113
00:09:44,006 --> 00:09:45,123
Don't know why
I put up with you.

114
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:48,563
Pick up, pick up...
Cute hair!

115
00:09:48,724 --> 00:09:49,726
Shit. Voicemail.

116
00:09:51,206 --> 00:09:53,484
I just found your blue folder.
The one with all the notes in it.

117
00:09:53,606 --> 00:09:55,206
I'm on the way to
the hotel right now.

118
00:09:55,325 --> 00:09:56,087
Go.

119
00:09:59,768 --> 00:10:00,765
Sorry, sorry.

120
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:22,369
Ladies, gentlemen,

121
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:26,969
today we are given an
opportunity to help mankind.

122
00:10:46,171 --> 00:10:47,772
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?

123
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:51,010
Could you please take this folder into
the conference room for me?

124
00:10:51,169 --> 00:10:53,050
My... Mr. Wyndham's
expecting it.

125
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:56,212
I'm sorry, miss, but that's
against hotel policy.

126
00:10:57,094 --> 00:10:59,174
But he could lose his job.

127
00:10:59,331 --> 00:11:00,734
That's tragic.

128
00:11:00,852 --> 00:11:02,931
But alas, not my problem.

129
00:11:03,812 --> 00:11:06,850
God, even when you guys
are nasty it sounds polite.

130
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,453
Now, in terms of
your investments...

131
00:11:09,573 --> 00:11:12,053
Shit. Briefcase is open.
I have to go in.

132
00:11:13,534 --> 00:11:17,054
Excuse me for interrupting,
Mr. Wyndham.

133
00:11:17,173 --> 00:11:21,853
This is for you, I just thought that you might
need the exact same folder you already have.

134
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,057
I see.

135
00:11:26,216 --> 00:11:27,896
Okay, well...

136
00:11:28,615 --> 00:11:30,493
false alarm. Terribly sorry.

137
00:11:30,655 --> 00:11:36,174
I just thought, I just wanted to make sure
you, he had everything he needed.

138
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:41,735
Because he worked so hard on it.

139
00:11:41,897 --> 00:11:43,774
I mean, really dedicated...

140
00:11:43,896 --> 00:11:47,697
and he deserves for this
to all go perfectly.

141
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:54,417
Not like this.
This is my fault. Me.

142
00:11:55,016 --> 00:11:58,820
So anyway, really nice
to meet all of you.

143
00:12:00,498 --> 00:12:03,256
You were right, they really are
a serious-looking bunch.

144
00:12:05,098 --> 00:12:06,337
In a good way.

145
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:13,619
So, in conclusion...

146
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:18,339
Ian's good. Give him the money.
See you later.

147
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:33,140
So, move on, shall we?

148
00:12:37,221 --> 00:12:38,623
I forgot my purse.

149
00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:45,421
He already had the folder.
Take this folder.

150
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,501
I never want to see it again.

151
00:12:49,585 --> 00:12:52,464
- I think that went well.
- Did it?

152
00:12:52,582 --> 00:12:56,861
Yeah, the glaring, the awkwardness.
The cold stare from Ian.

153
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,585
Just what I was hoping for.

154
00:12:59,383 --> 00:13:01,064
I think I talked too much.

155
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:03,784
Come on, let's go to work.

156
00:13:03,903 --> 00:13:07,025
There's a guy there who loves
your delightfully impulsive nature.

157
00:13:20,626 --> 00:13:23,146
I can't do it. I'm bad.

158
00:13:23,305 --> 00:13:24,984
Come here.

159
00:13:26,026 --> 00:13:28,949
You are not bad.
Do you know why?

160
00:13:29,945 --> 00:13:32,588
Because if you were bad, then that
would mean I was a bad teacher...

161
00:13:32,749 --> 00:13:36,627
and in fact I am
a fabulous teacher, right?

162
00:13:36,785 --> 00:13:40,545
Hence, you couldn't
possibly be bad.

163
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:42,868
You've got a point.

164
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:46,987
Come on.
Let's all play together.

165
00:13:48,866 --> 00:13:53,628
You're ready?
One, two, three...

166
00:14:03,471 --> 00:14:04,870
Did you land the money then?

167
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:07,072
I had them, I had them
in the palm of my hand.

168
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,671
I can't believe Samantha
pulled that stunt after...

169
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:14,471
She spent all morning being peeved at me for
'not being in the moment' or some such bollocks.

170
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:15,790
All birds are like that.

171
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,192
Especially the yanks.
Where do they come up with them?

172
00:14:18,351 --> 00:14:19,352
Oprah.

173
00:14:19,871 --> 00:14:20,991
Oh, right.

174
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,072
You're up guys.

175
00:14:23,954 --> 00:14:27,152
Excuse me, miss. I couldn't help
but notice that you work here.

176
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:31,593
I was just wondering
what time you... knock off?

177
00:14:32,594 --> 00:14:34,193
Oh, just piss off, will you?

178
00:14:44,194 --> 00:14:46,834
Oh, shit. Sorry, mate.

179
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:51,831
That's all right, mate.
I should be heading off anyway.

180
00:14:53,234 --> 00:14:57,236
Samantha. Right.
See you later, boys.

181
00:14:57,434 --> 00:14:58,677
Bye bye, Romeo.

182
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,677
- I think she liked you.
- Definitely liked you, mate.

183
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,636
I just need an objective
person to tell me...

184
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:18,254
if the surrealist nudes
should go on the east wall...

185
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:21,399
or wether I should put the
multiple falus sculptures there.

186
00:15:21,478 --> 00:15:23,479
They look pretty amazing
when the sun hits them.

187
00:15:23,597 --> 00:15:24,720
I bet they do.

188
00:15:27,357 --> 00:15:28,918
Is that Ian?

189
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:35,000
What's he doing?

190
00:15:42,878 --> 00:15:44,319
Surprise.

191
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:36,845
Clifton Hall, please.

192
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:45,488
That's a music school, isn't it?

193
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:47,968
Yeah, there's a concert
there tonight.

194
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,088
Your girlfriend's a musician.

195
00:16:51,204 --> 00:16:52,207
That's right.

196
00:16:52,924 --> 00:16:55,168
And you're having problems
with your love life.

197
00:16:58,288 --> 00:16:59,888
How in the world
did you know that?

198
00:17:00,008 --> 00:17:04,288
People in my profession are second only to bar
men in knowing about the problems of the heart.

199
00:17:08,488 --> 00:17:09,568
So what's the trouble?

200
00:17:11,728 --> 00:17:13,127
Ah, don't wanna talk about it.

201
00:17:13,571 --> 00:17:17,010
That's a good idea. The thing
will probably just fix itself.

202
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:27,770
Well, I can't seem
to make her happy.

203
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:31,690
How can you love someone
so much and not know how...

204
00:17:32,612 --> 00:17:34,370
how to love her?

205
00:17:34,532 --> 00:17:35,813
So you do love her?

206
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,530
Yes, very much.

207
00:17:38,648 --> 00:17:40,051
Yeah, well that's
all that matters.

208
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:43,331
She's going away tomorrow,
for two weeks.

209
00:17:43,452 --> 00:17:44,453
She wants me to go with her.

210
00:17:44,612 --> 00:17:46,091
What if she never came back?

211
00:17:48,054 --> 00:17:49,373
What sort of a question is that?

212
00:17:49,494 --> 00:17:54,050
Well, come on, picture it. You wave goodbye
at the airport she gets on an airplane...

213
00:17:54,212 --> 00:17:55,972
you never see her again.

214
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,054
Could you live with that?

215
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:03,693
No.

216
00:18:07,735 --> 00:18:10,572
No, I couldn't.

217
00:18:15,255 --> 00:18:16,856
Well, you know what to do.

218
00:18:18,335 --> 00:18:21,173
Appreciate her,
and what you have.

219
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:25,496
Just love her.

220
00:18:29,457 --> 00:18:30,697
It's not for another two blocks.

221
00:18:30,816 --> 00:18:32,778
You can't show up
empty-handed.

222
00:18:51,181 --> 00:18:53,818
You know, if Ian bought a ticket
and if he's coming home with me,

223
00:18:53,938 --> 00:18:56,698
that's really sweet. I mean,
maybe he's coming around.

224
00:18:56,816 --> 00:18:59,301
I hope so, you deserve it.

225
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:02,178
And if Ian doesn't know that,
he's nothing but a deep shit.

226
00:19:02,778 --> 00:19:05,258
You always know
exactly what to say.

227
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:07,940
Now remember,
you are the bee's knees.

228
00:19:09,503 --> 00:19:12,740
It's a good thing.
Have a great time tonight.

229
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,378
Thank you, bye.

230
00:19:42,144 --> 00:19:45,266
Next, Melvina Walters will sing...

231
00:19:45,424 --> 00:19:48,062
Juliet's Waltz, by Guno.

232
00:20:13,387 --> 00:20:15,950
Hi, thanks.

233
00:20:17,028 --> 00:20:17,947
Ready?

234
00:20:18,106 --> 00:20:20,068
Uh, yeah. See you later.

235
00:20:21,148 --> 00:20:22,267
Enjoy the great trip.

236
00:20:25,866 --> 00:20:29,749
Hey Oliver, oh,
you made it, hi!

237
00:20:29,908 --> 00:20:32,667
Are you kidding? He wouldn't
have missed it for the world.

238
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,829
She was the best one.

239
00:20:36,351 --> 00:20:39,346
I love Miss Andrews,
everyone does.

240
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,110
It I was just a
few years older...

241
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,229
You!

242
00:20:48,351 --> 00:20:50,709
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

243
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,312
Ian, is this not just
the cutest card?

244
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,790
Yeah, we should go.

245
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,915
- Well, I...
- That's okay,

246
00:21:02,072 --> 00:21:03,672
we need to go too.

247
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,352
It was a disaster,

248
00:21:11,511 --> 00:21:14,832
Dunbar passed, Drown is pissed
and I'm screwed.

249
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,712
- God, Ian, I'm so sorry...
- Forget it.

250
00:21:26,955 --> 00:21:29,433
So, what else is going on?

251
00:21:30,513 --> 00:21:32,597
Lottie has an exhibit tomorrow.

252
00:21:32,715 --> 00:21:36,034
Some bigshot gallery, the 'Zinc'.

253
00:21:36,197 --> 00:21:37,477
I went down there to help with...

254
00:21:37,636 --> 00:21:38,715
Sounds like fun.

255
00:21:46,076 --> 00:21:48,437
Wanna dance?

256
00:21:49,717 --> 00:21:51,596
When have you ever
seen me dance?

257
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,954
So where did you go this afternoon after
your meeting? I called your cell a zillion times.

258
00:21:57,116 --> 00:22:00,037
Oh, I turned it off.
Didn't wanna hear from anyone.

259
00:22:00,198 --> 00:22:03,199
Spent the rest of the day
walking around the city, thinking.

260
00:22:03,358 --> 00:22:04,115
About?

261
00:22:04,237 --> 00:22:06,393
About us, and whether
we're gonna make it.

262
00:22:08,756 --> 00:22:10,719
No I didn't mean that,
you don't understand.

263
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:16,957
I have to admit our morning was not
the greatest, and the meeting was...

264
00:22:21,438 --> 00:22:26,759
I was wondering what to do,
and then I met this cab driver.

265
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,398
A cab driver, you talked...

266
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:30,322
Sounds weird, but
it was good, really.

267
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,119
He made me realize that even though you
and I have problems, we share a lot too.

268
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,042
We enjoy each other, and
I should appreciate that.

269
00:22:39,202 --> 00:22:42,802
It's underneath everything,
and despite this awful day,

270
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,962
I adore you.

271
00:22:48,681 --> 00:22:52,118
I guess what I'm saying is, I...

272
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,722
I wanna soldier on.

273
00:22:54,844 --> 00:22:56,164
I really do.

274
00:22:57,724 --> 00:22:58,722
Okay?

275
00:23:08,684 --> 00:23:09,524
No.

276
00:23:09,646 --> 00:23:10,683
No what?

277
00:23:11,283 --> 00:23:13,843
I don't wanna soldier on.

278
00:23:17,043 --> 00:23:21,606
Ian, if I were to stay in London now,
it would only be for you.

279
00:23:21,764 --> 00:23:26,123
For us, and I would
do that in a heartbeat...

280
00:23:26,284 --> 00:23:28,725
if I thought that
we were really special.

281
00:23:28,845 --> 00:23:30,366
- We are.
- Really?

282
00:23:31,365 --> 00:23:34,007
You never tell me how you feel
or talk about yourself.

283
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:36,808
You don't wanna meet my family,
you forgot my graduation,

284
00:23:36,926 --> 00:23:41,605
we ran into my favorite student, and
you act as if he has something contagious.

285
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,686
Ian, I know you have
the best intentions...

286
00:23:48,246 --> 00:23:53,287
but I just feel that I'm a very
high second priority for you.

287
00:23:56,807 --> 00:23:58,209
That hurts.

288
00:24:02,205 --> 00:24:05,248
And the worst part is
I'm starting to get used to it.

289
00:24:06,726 --> 00:24:07,849
I don't understand.

290
00:24:09,808 --> 00:24:10,728
I know.

291
00:24:14,008 --> 00:24:15,407
It's what kills me.

292
00:24:17,851 --> 00:24:20,410
If there'd just been one day, Ian...

293
00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:23,849
one day, when nothing else
mattered for us...

294
00:24:24,368 --> 00:24:26,770
- I adore you!
- I don't wanna be adored.

295
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,251
I wanna be loved.

296
00:24:33,692 --> 00:24:34,734
Where are you going?

297
00:24:36,094 --> 00:24:39,211
Spend the night at Lottie's,
to the airport tomorrow and...

298
00:24:42,051 --> 00:24:43,734
I can't do this anymore.

299
00:24:52,415 --> 00:24:54,770
I saw you at the
travel agency today.

300
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:57,614
Where are you going?

301
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,296
Johannesburg, business.

302
00:25:16,535 --> 00:25:20,536
Samantha, Samantha wait, please.

303
00:25:20,697 --> 00:25:23,415
You can't do this to me.
You can't leave me.

304
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:28,536
You're saying, you're saying
that I'll never see you again?

305
00:25:35,176 --> 00:25:36,656
You coming or not?

306
00:25:43,815 --> 00:25:47,620
In or out my friend,
it's your choice.

307
00:26:20,825 --> 00:26:22,220
Samantha!

308
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:51,146
No, Samantha!

309
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,823
Baby, baby please no!

310
00:26:57,424 --> 00:27:00,464
Baby, baby please...

311
00:27:02,024 --> 00:27:06,508
Help me, help me, help me!

312
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,035
So sorry.

313
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,918
I wanted to be with her...

314
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,999
I really did.

315
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:23,999
How can this happen?
How could she go?

316
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,341
Read one word, and I'll kill you.

317
00:32:43,621 --> 00:32:44,818
I was just kidding!

318
00:32:46,021 --> 00:32:47,581
You're, you're, you're here!

319
00:32:47,741 --> 00:32:49,700
Yes yes, and you're scaring me.

320
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:53,942
I, I, I...

321
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,259
You...

322
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,182
I...

323
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,738
You...

324
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:03,260
Okay, I'm gonna approach you,

325
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,663
and and, now I'm gonna hug you.

326
00:33:22,304 --> 00:33:25,622
It's okay, everything's
gonna be okay.

327
00:33:29,786 --> 00:33:31,383
I'm really gonna miss you.

328
00:33:31,506 --> 00:33:34,786
Me too, I really will miss you Sam.
I hope you know that.

329
00:33:34,907 --> 00:33:36,865
It's important that
you believe me.

330
00:33:37,025 --> 00:33:38,025
I believe you.

331
00:33:38,666 --> 00:33:41,946
And I would hate, hate for you to
have to go through so much pain,

332
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:45,827
so, instead of missing me, why
don't you come with me to Ohio?

333
00:33:47,106 --> 00:33:48,106
Samantha...

334
00:33:48,744 --> 00:33:49,948
You're definitely not coming.

335
00:33:50,825 --> 00:33:51,785
I can't.

336
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:54,826
Of course you can't, work,
I know, big meeting...

337
00:33:55,268 --> 00:34:00,308
I... I had a meeting...
and you...

338
00:34:00,428 --> 00:34:04,066
Ian, calm down.
Calm down!

339
00:34:04,469 --> 00:34:08,467
Look, you're very prepared for today
and you're gonna be great.

340
00:34:12,548 --> 00:34:14,307
Don't go anywhere.
What are you doing?

341
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:18,148
Sit, don't move your
cute british butt.

342
00:34:19,749 --> 00:34:22,390
- There's a gift.
- There's a gift.

343
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,754
This can't be happening.

344
00:34:25,872 --> 00:34:27,470
Well of course it can.
I like buying things for you,

345
00:34:27,551 --> 00:34:29,510
and I wanna say
goodbye properly.

346
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:35,748
Portobello Road.
10 pounds!

347
00:34:35,913 --> 00:34:40,271
Plus, look at this.

348
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:41,991
Oh my God!

349
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:45,671
Okay, not the reaction
I was looking for.

350
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:51,992
I'm sorry, I just, I had
a terrible nightmare.

351
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:54,190
And I can't seem
to get rid of it.

352
00:34:55,396 --> 00:34:59,111
I... and you...

353
00:35:00,594 --> 00:35:01,674
We?

354
00:35:02,193 --> 00:35:03,316
We...

355
00:35:05,195 --> 00:35:07,431
should... eat?

356
00:35:07,951 --> 00:35:11,956
Yes, yes! We should
have breakfast.

357
00:35:12,115 --> 00:35:14,475
Let's have breakfast, together.

358
00:35:17,474 --> 00:35:18,594
Okay.

359
00:35:44,276 --> 00:35:46,277
I am the coolest.

360
00:35:47,837 --> 00:35:51,278
Samantha?
Watch out, the coffee pot!

361
00:35:51,678 --> 00:35:54,640
I see it, crazy yelling man.

362
00:35:56,599 --> 00:36:00,000
I know, I just thought
you might hurt yourself.

363
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:10,159
Sam?

364
00:36:15,878 --> 00:36:17,479
Oh, I'm sorry. Am I too loud?

365
00:36:17,601 --> 00:36:21,039
No. I was actually hoping
that you'd sing.

366
00:36:21,161 --> 00:36:23,722
You need to get out more.

367
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:28,721
You are a great songwriter.
And you need to let people see that.

368
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,321
It's an amazing gift.

369
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,445
You're biased.

370
00:36:34,162 --> 00:36:35,163
That's true.

371
00:36:42,884 --> 00:36:44,762
God, I am such a klutz.

372
00:36:46,524 --> 00:36:48,522
You burned yourself
on the hand.

373
00:36:48,642 --> 00:36:50,805
Keen Powers of observation.

374
00:36:59,404 --> 00:37:03,963
Ian, what's wrong with you? I burn myself
with that damn thing every other day.

375
00:37:04,127 --> 00:37:04,926
You do?

376
00:37:05,086 --> 00:37:07,126
Yes, I do.

377
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:13,683
What are you doing?

378
00:37:14,487 --> 00:37:15,763
We always go that way.

379
00:37:16,285 --> 00:37:18,368
And do you know why?

380
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:20,488
Why?

381
00:37:20,606 --> 00:37:23,489
Because that's where
you work and I teach.

382
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:28,486
Let's try a new way.
Loop around. It might be fun!

383
00:37:43,411 --> 00:37:45,291
I like this route better,
don't you?

384
00:37:57,813 --> 00:37:58,931
Care to explain?

385
00:37:59,531 --> 00:38:02,851
I just thought the scooter
seemed a little... speedy.

386
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:09,371
Watch where you're going!

387
00:38:09,533 --> 00:38:11,492
You've got to be kidding me.

388
00:38:16,613 --> 00:38:18,009
It wasn't a dream.

389
00:38:18,371 --> 00:38:19,292
What?

390
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,893
All these things happening today,
every single one,

391
00:38:22,973 --> 00:38:24,454
I already knew
they would happen.

392
00:38:24,613 --> 00:38:25,333
What do you mean?

393
00:38:25,452 --> 00:38:28,492
The leatherjacket. The burn.
The coca cola spilled on your sweater.

394
00:38:28,613 --> 00:38:33,495
I already saw or dreamt those things.
Some happened a little differently, but...

395
00:38:33,612 --> 00:38:37,055
Okay Ian, calm down. You know,
sometimes I've had deja vu, and it...

396
00:38:37,173 --> 00:38:39,816
But it's not deja vu.
In deja vu...

397
00:38:39,975 --> 00:38:43,175
it feels like it's already happened.
You don't know what's going to happen.

398
00:38:43,335 --> 00:38:46,936
Alright, what happened in the dream
that freaked you out so badly?

399
00:38:47,454 --> 00:38:49,336
It was...

400
00:38:55,019 --> 00:38:56,538
it was awful.

401
00:38:57,615 --> 00:39:01,697
Okay. Let's be
logical about this.

402
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:06,615
In your dream or vision,
or whatever, what happens next?

403
00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:13,619
You go back to the apartment to wash
your sweater and I go to my meeting.

404
00:39:15,017 --> 00:39:17,536
That is awful.

405
00:39:19,259 --> 00:39:21,816
On the way to my meeting,
my watch cracks.

406
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:26,699
Okay. So here's what
we're going to do.

407
00:39:26,858 --> 00:39:30,261
We'll walk to your office together.
And if your watch cracks...

408
00:39:30,378 --> 00:39:35,258
then we'll know something's
going on, and we'll deal with it.

409
00:39:35,781 --> 00:39:36,777
Okay?

410
00:39:56,701 --> 00:39:57,902
Almost there.

411
00:40:01,503 --> 00:40:04,143
We're holding hands.
I like holding hands.

412
00:40:04,664 --> 00:40:05,663
Me too.

413
00:40:08,026 --> 00:40:09,501
Do you have the time?

414
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:14,224
Sorry. Watch.
Sore subject.

415
00:40:24,468 --> 00:40:25,503
It's fine.

416
00:40:27,265 --> 00:40:28,665
You're just nervous.

417
00:40:31,027 --> 00:40:32,786
You're right,
I'm sure you're right.

418
00:40:33,304 --> 00:40:37,786
So, you okay?
You ready for the meeting?

419
00:40:39,268 --> 00:40:40,185
Yes.

420
00:40:41,266 --> 00:40:45,745
Good luck. Not that you need it.
You're going to be great.

421
00:40:47,429 --> 00:40:49,507
I'll see you tonight
at the concert.

422
00:40:49,627 --> 00:40:51,586
Concert?
What concert?

423
00:40:52,989 --> 00:40:56,507
I was kidding.
That was me kidding.

424
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,907
You know, the british sense of...

425
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:01,669
Nevermind.

426
00:41:04,231 --> 00:41:05,347
Bye.

427
00:41:05,865 --> 00:41:07,350
Yeah, see you tonight.

428
00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:18,631
Do me a favor. Call Tantra and
push my reservation to nine.

429
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:21,109
And have someone dash over to
Harvey Nicks. I need a present for...

430
00:41:21,272 --> 00:41:26,108
For Samantha's graduation concert?
You forgot. I reminded you twice.

431
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:30,990
Yes, no, I don't know. I don't know
if I did or didn't forget.

432
00:41:31,147 --> 00:41:34,470
I forgot yesterday,
but I don't think I forgot today.

433
00:41:37,472 --> 00:41:39,632
Did you wear that yesterday?

434
00:41:40,274 --> 00:41:41,271
Quite possibly.

435
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:44,074
On the pittance you pay me,
I've only got a few things.

436
00:41:45,552 --> 00:41:46,953
Claire, can I ask you
a question?

437
00:41:47,473 --> 00:41:48,873
If you must.

438
00:41:49,194 --> 00:41:54,354
Did you ever have a dream and
the next day everything feels familiar?

439
00:41:54,473 --> 00:41:56,435
You know, like it's
from the dream?

440
00:41:56,872 --> 00:42:00,874
Yes. I have.
For example last night,

441
00:42:00,996 --> 00:42:05,274
I dreamt that you would bore me to death
first thing this morning, and lo and behold...

442
00:42:05,433 --> 00:42:07,112
Come on, seriously.

443
00:42:07,834 --> 00:42:09,117
Seriously?

444
00:42:10,717 --> 00:42:11,715
Yes.

445
00:42:13,716 --> 00:42:17,797
Ian, I believe dreams
are very important.

446
00:42:17,916 --> 00:42:19,837
They should be listened to.

447
00:42:20,514 --> 00:42:21,834
You really think so?

448
00:42:22,435 --> 00:42:23,554
Yes.

449
00:42:26,197 --> 00:42:29,235
And I also believe that you
should get over to that meeting...

450
00:42:29,356 --> 00:42:31,917
or you'll be sacked,
and I'll be on the dole.

451
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:39,195
And those are
AGS's main objectives.

452
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:41,519
To design new ways
to treat, cure,

453
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,158
or prevent the countless illnesses
that inflict humankind.

454
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,918
I'm happy and more than
a little proud to report...

455
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:54,359
that AGS is way ahead
of the competition in this area.

456
00:42:58,639 --> 00:42:59,959
Now...

457
00:43:04,321 --> 00:43:06,560
in terms of your investments...

458
00:43:20,963 --> 00:43:25,401
these 7-year projections clearly document
everything we've discussed so far.

459
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,960
We've amortized the cost of the
research over a 10-year period.

460
00:43:29,122 --> 00:43:31,644
I knew it!
I knew you'd be here!

461
00:43:53,204 --> 00:43:54,323
Okay.

462
00:43:55,686 --> 00:44:00,925
You've heard my pitch, and I can tell by
the unbridled excitement on your faces...

463
00:44:03,485 --> 00:44:06,405
Come on, guys. Settle down.
This is not a party.

464
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:14,206
This research isn't about perfect projections
or amortized costs or beating the competition.

465
00:44:14,368 --> 00:44:19,885
It's about giving people the most
precious gift possible... time.

466
00:44:20,008 --> 00:44:22,887
This is a great opportunity,
and I say grab it.

467
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:25,650
What do you think?

468
00:44:31,847 --> 00:44:34,010
- Did you land the money?
- I did.

469
00:44:34,888 --> 00:44:37,929
And it was the strangest thing because the other
time when Samantha walked into the meeting,

470
00:44:38,091 --> 00:44:40,049
I thought she messed
everything up.

471
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:44,370
Oh, I didn't tell you guys
about the dream I had.

472
00:44:44,491 --> 00:44:46,689
Of course not, because
that would be tonight.

473
00:44:47,572 --> 00:44:50,329
Okay. Tell us
about the dream.

474
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:51,771
It's more of a deja vu.

475
00:44:51,891 --> 00:44:55,608
Deja vu. Sometimes dismissed
as a random neurological event...

476
00:44:55,729 --> 00:44:58,011
but is often a message
from deep within the soul.

477
00:44:58,131 --> 00:45:02,695
And when the soul comes tapping
at the door, it's time to let him in.

478
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:04,329
Oprah.

479
00:45:04,492 --> 00:45:05,612
No.

480
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:08,411
Dr. Phil.

481
00:45:09,495 --> 00:45:10,411
You're up guys.

482
00:45:10,733 --> 00:45:13,414
No, no, no. That's not
what I'm talking about.

483
00:45:13,813 --> 00:45:16,935
There are certain things that
I know are going to happen.

484
00:45:17,852 --> 00:45:20,611
Excuse me?
But haven't we met before...

485
00:45:21,611 --> 00:45:22,814
in my dreams?

486
00:45:22,933 --> 00:45:24,613
Oh, just piss off, will you?

487
00:45:24,975 --> 00:45:27,015
You see? I knew
that would happen.

488
00:45:27,175 --> 00:45:30,294
We all knew that would happen.

489
00:45:31,853 --> 00:45:35,652
Can you remember anything useful?
Like the 3:30 winner at Newmarket?

490
00:45:35,815 --> 00:45:39,894
No I'm afraid not.
But everything's the same.

491
00:45:40,012 --> 00:45:42,895
It's just in a slightly
different order.

492
00:45:46,855 --> 00:45:48,338
Slightly different order.

493
00:45:57,133 --> 00:45:59,178
I've got to go.

494
00:46:09,938 --> 00:46:11,339
Mackenzie street, please.

495
00:46:11,859 --> 00:46:12,777
Yes, sir.

496
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,580
You've got to be kidding me.

497
00:46:25,578 --> 00:46:26,778
Excuse me, sir?

498
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:29,261
You're the driver
from yesterday.

499
00:46:30,099 --> 00:46:31,502
Anything's possible.

500
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,342
Yesterday you knew
certain things about me.

501
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,382
About your love life?

502
00:46:36,979 --> 00:46:38,300
Yes.

503
00:46:38,423 --> 00:46:42,063
Yeah well people in my profession
are second only to barmen...

504
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,981
in knowing about
problems of the heart.

505
00:46:44,103 --> 00:46:46,260
And that, you said that exactly.

506
00:46:48,218 --> 00:46:52,024
So if you're the same,
if this cab ride is the same...

507
00:46:52,183 --> 00:46:55,184
then everything else today
will be the same.

508
00:46:55,346 --> 00:46:59,222
At the end of the day, my
girlfriend gets into this taxi...

509
00:46:59,384 --> 00:47:03,182
it stops at a light,
it's hit, and she...

510
00:47:07,383 --> 00:47:08,785
Is that going to happen?

511
00:47:11,783 --> 00:47:12,708
Is it?

512
00:47:19,065 --> 00:47:21,066
What if she doesn't
get in the cab?

513
00:47:23,387 --> 00:47:25,305
What if I take her
out of London?

514
00:47:28,028 --> 00:47:30,384
Maybe if we stay
in the apartment...

515
00:47:32,707 --> 00:47:36,150
Tell me, what can I do?
There must be something I can do!

516
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:39,105
Just one thing.

517
00:47:40,027 --> 00:47:43,707
Appreciate her.
And what you have.

518
00:47:46,066 --> 00:47:48,989
Just love her.

519
00:47:55,868 --> 00:47:58,391
Will you let me out?
Let me out right now!

520
00:47:58,549 --> 00:47:59,668
Certainly, sir.

521
00:48:01,513 --> 00:48:02,628
No, that's alright, sir.

522
00:48:04,865 --> 00:48:06,669
Why not?

523
00:48:06,791 --> 00:48:08,470
You paid me yesterday.

524
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:14,828
Better hurry up.
You haven't got much time.

525
00:48:39,076 --> 00:48:40,834
Samantha Andrews,
where is she?

526
00:48:40,993 --> 00:48:43,155
I have no idea.
Are you alright?

527
00:48:46,073 --> 00:48:47,195
Oliver?

528
00:48:52,034 --> 00:48:53,993
There's three next door, as well.

529
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:03,038
Oliver?

530
00:49:31,318 --> 00:49:32,517
Samantha!

531
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,839
I'm sorry.

532
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:45,560
Sam?

533
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,721
Lottie!

534
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,522
Come on...

535
00:50:25,403 --> 00:50:27,282
Can I help you?

536
00:50:28,685 --> 00:50:31,122
Hi. I know you don't know me.
I'm a friend of Lottie's.

537
00:50:31,243 --> 00:50:35,526
This will sound really strange,
but I need to get into her apartment.

538
00:50:35,684 --> 00:50:36,884
Never seen you around before.

539
00:50:37,006 --> 00:50:40,324
Actually I'm her best friend's boyfriend.
Do you know Samantha Andrews?

540
00:50:40,484 --> 00:50:44,365
Of course. I love miss Andrews.
Everyone does.

541
00:50:45,564 --> 00:50:48,004
If I was just
a few years younger...

542
00:51:21,689 --> 00:51:22,530
Zinc!

543
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:25,090
Hey, can we eat at some point?
I barely had breakfast.

544
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:28,010
Don't be such
a big girl's blouse.

545
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:33,369
A wimp. A wuss.
Cry-baby.

546
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:37,488
Samantha!
Thank God I found you.

547
00:51:37,934 --> 00:51:40,171
Lottie, I'm sorry, but I have to get
Samantha out of here right now.

548
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:41,256
What is with you today?

549
00:51:41,372 --> 00:51:45,090
You have to trust me. Things are happening
from yesterday. They're jumbled up...

550
00:51:45,212 --> 00:51:47,409
but they're happening
again in some way.

551
00:51:47,572 --> 00:51:48,771
We already went through this.

552
00:51:48,892 --> 00:51:52,010
I know, and maybe you're right.
Maybe it's stress. But all I know...

553
00:51:52,173 --> 00:51:55,294
is that we have to
leave London. Immediately!

554
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:56,371
I promised Lottie.

555
00:51:56,491 --> 00:52:01,451
You've helped loads. You're right.
The fallacies will look great in the garden.

556
00:52:01,856 --> 00:52:04,495
Ian, I have my concert tonight.
Remember?

557
00:52:04,652 --> 00:52:07,095
I'll have you back
in time. I swear.

558
00:52:14,054 --> 00:52:18,614
Let's go. I have to get you out
of London now. Just trust me on this.

559
00:52:42,938 --> 00:52:44,539
Okay, let's go.

560
00:52:45,176 --> 00:52:46,215
Now will you tell me
where we're going?

561
00:52:46,338 --> 00:52:48,776
You said anywhere I want to.

562
00:52:48,937 --> 00:52:52,459
So stop asking. Just enjoy not
knowing what's going to happen.

563
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:06,460
Hang on a minute.

564
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,103
What do you think?

565
00:53:08,899 --> 00:53:11,179
If you don't want to stop here
we can just keep going.

566
00:53:11,297 --> 00:53:14,420
- But how did you even know that this was my...
- You told me where you were from.

567
00:53:15,262 --> 00:53:16,741
I've never met your family.

568
00:53:17,939 --> 00:53:21,261
They've been busy.

569
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,461
I really want to see
where you grew up.

570
00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:27,100
I want to see where little Ian
went to school and played soccer.

571
00:53:27,263 --> 00:53:30,742
Sorry, football, american.

572
00:53:33,863 --> 00:53:36,780
I want to see where you
became the man I love.

573
00:53:39,143 --> 00:53:42,982
If you had something to hide, you
shouldn't have said 'anywhere you want to'.

574
00:54:03,383 --> 00:54:06,704
I think I heard thunder.
It's gonna pour.

575
00:54:06,824 --> 00:54:08,305
You do know it's raining, right?

576
00:54:08,465 --> 00:54:10,426
You're just trying to
get out of this. Keep going.

577
00:54:10,584 --> 00:54:13,147
Feed me soon
or face the consequences.

578
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:15,547
This was a lot steeper
when I was a kid.

579
00:54:15,945 --> 00:54:18,307
They must have come in here with
heavy machinery and flattened it out.

580
00:54:18,465 --> 00:54:19,665
Unless you've changed.

581
00:54:19,787 --> 00:54:21,587
Me? Not possible.

582
00:54:22,106 --> 00:54:23,388
Are we going to that shack?

583
00:54:23,547 --> 00:54:26,948
- No. We need to get to the top, so keep walking.
- Yes, chief.

584
00:54:27,107 --> 00:54:29,948
So what's at the top
of 'Ian's magical hill'?

585
00:54:30,069 --> 00:54:33,188
Nothing, really.
Except the solitude.

586
00:54:33,709 --> 00:54:38,550
Being away from everything.
I'd go up there to read or think.

587
00:54:38,709 --> 00:54:41,386
I felt safe there, at peace.

588
00:54:41,705 --> 00:54:43,788
It's definitely going to pour.

589
00:54:46,308 --> 00:54:49,271
Pouring rain in England?
Not likely.

590
00:54:49,388 --> 00:54:50,314
Come on.

591
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:10,753
No wonder you never took me to meet
your family. They have a very small house.

592
00:55:14,272 --> 00:55:17,191
Why didn't you
tell me about them?

593
00:55:17,352 --> 00:55:22,192
I'm always yapping about my friends and
family, but you never talk about yours.

594
00:55:22,914 --> 00:55:25,351
Sam, let's just forget
about everything.

595
00:55:25,472 --> 00:55:26,913
You know...
I just want to...

596
00:55:28,552 --> 00:55:31,593
I just want to be here.
With you.

597
00:56:54,923 --> 00:56:57,321
You really don't want to
talk about your past, do you?

598
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,403
The past doesn't matter.

599
00:57:11,163 --> 00:57:13,526
What matters is only now.

600
00:57:19,601 --> 00:57:21,885
You really are
acting funny today.

601
00:57:23,286 --> 00:57:24,844
Keep it up, okay?

602
00:57:28,926 --> 00:57:30,408
Can I ask you a question?

603
00:57:31,044 --> 00:57:32,166
Sure.

604
00:57:34,964 --> 00:57:37,045
If for some reason you thought
you didn't have a lot of time left...

605
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:38,607
You mean today?

606
00:57:40,725 --> 00:57:44,167
No, I mean in life.

607
00:57:45,446 --> 00:57:50,286
If you had one day left,
what would you do?

608
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:52,607
That's an odd question.

609
00:57:52,729 --> 00:57:54,126
I'd just like to know.

610
00:57:55,527 --> 00:57:59,530
Well, let's see...
my last day on earth.

611
00:57:59,648 --> 00:58:04,691
Shoe shopping. And eating
ten hot fudge sundaes.

612
00:58:04,851 --> 00:58:10,089
And there's that Calvin Klein underwear model.
Might be fun to get to know him better.

613
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:19,010
It's an easy answer.
A no-brainer.

614
00:58:19,129 --> 00:58:21,010
I'd spend it with you.

615
00:58:22,289 --> 00:58:23,530
Really?

616
00:58:24,131 --> 00:58:25,529
Of course.

617
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:30,930
Just being together.
Like now.

618
00:58:31,088 --> 00:58:33,050
Doing nothing.

619
00:58:37,693 --> 00:58:38,934
And that's it?

620
00:58:44,132 --> 00:58:45,453
Nothing else?

621
00:58:48,572 --> 00:58:53,611
A closeness.
An intense closeness.

622
00:58:55,373 --> 00:58:58,492
Really sharing things
with each other.

623
00:58:58,612 --> 00:59:04,176
Silly things. Difficult things.

624
00:59:05,653 --> 00:59:10,214
That's what I've always wanted
for us, and if we could have that...

625
00:59:10,334 --> 00:59:12,333
nothing could hurt us.

626
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:22,493
I love you.

627
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:28,977
Good.

628
01:00:29,347 --> 01:00:33,144
The rain's letting up. Do you want
to go to the top of your hill?

629
01:00:34,425 --> 01:00:35,542
No.

630
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:40,340
I want to take you
somewhere else.

631
01:00:42,183 --> 01:00:43,585
Do I have to climb?

632
01:00:57,385 --> 01:00:59,426
Maybe we should
wait another minute.

633
01:01:00,906 --> 01:01:02,304
Good idea.

634
01:01:44,432 --> 01:01:46,991
Your dad was a
very handsome guy.

635
01:01:47,109 --> 01:01:51,312
So I guess you took
after your mom, right?

636
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:54,190
He spent a lot of time here?

637
01:01:54,311 --> 01:01:55,549
Yeah, he did.

638
01:01:55,670 --> 01:02:00,150
After he got laid off
in '93. Here all the time.

639
01:02:01,512 --> 01:02:03,710
When I was a kid,
my dad was my hero.

640
01:02:04,313 --> 01:02:06,752
I thought he was the
strongest man in the world.

641
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:10,791
He was so proud.

642
01:02:10,952 --> 01:02:14,350
His job at the factory wasn't
just any job to him, you know?

643
01:02:16,311 --> 01:02:17,913
Everyone loved him.

644
01:02:18,634 --> 01:02:22,833
And his family,
we all worshiped him.

645
01:02:22,993 --> 01:02:24,474
He sounds wonderful.

646
01:02:24,592 --> 01:02:25,714
He is.

647
01:02:28,073 --> 01:02:29,273
Well, he was.

648
01:02:30,675 --> 01:02:35,795
Then the owner decided to relocate
and they all lost their jobs.

649
01:02:36,593 --> 01:02:41,952
He never found another.
This became his second home.

650
01:02:46,674 --> 01:02:50,474
From the age of 15 on
I don't think I ever saw him sober.

651
01:02:52,076 --> 01:02:55,479
And I've been determined
not to let that happen to me.

652
01:02:56,678 --> 01:02:59,118
To live my life
at the whim of others.

653
01:02:59,559 --> 01:03:01,435
You don't have to.

654
01:03:02,718 --> 01:03:04,798
I know that now.

655
01:03:08,001 --> 01:03:09,679
I just wish I could
have helped him.

656
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:11,322
You were only a kid.

657
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,557
I know.

658
01:03:15,478 --> 01:03:20,960
But to watch your father,
your hero, just...

659
01:03:21,078 --> 01:03:24,518
dissolve right before your eyes...

660
01:03:26,278 --> 01:03:27,957
You really loved your dad.

661
01:03:30,121 --> 01:03:31,120
Yeah.

662
01:03:33,283 --> 01:03:35,720
I hope he knew how much.

663
01:03:37,678 --> 01:03:40,719
Wherever he is, I bet
he knows how you feel.

664
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,804
Ian, death doesn't
put an end to love.

665
01:03:53,924 --> 01:03:55,120
You think so?

666
01:03:56,243 --> 01:03:57,724
I know it.

667
01:04:08,243 --> 01:04:11,764
Why didn't you ever
tell me any of this?

668
01:04:15,444 --> 01:04:16,763
I guess...

669
01:04:19,284 --> 01:04:23,485
I guess I just didn't want
to feel any of it.

670
01:04:26,805 --> 01:04:29,246
I'm so glad we're here.

671
01:04:33,207 --> 01:04:34,326
Me, too.

672
01:04:46,364 --> 01:04:47,889
I wish we didn't have to go.

673
01:04:48,007 --> 01:04:48,927
Go where?

674
01:04:49,048 --> 01:04:52,288
Back to London. My graduation concert.
Any of this ringing a bell?

675
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:53,729
Let's not go back.

676
01:04:54,727 --> 01:04:57,569
Let's just get on a train
and ride off somewhere.

677
01:04:59,447 --> 01:05:03,733
Let's see. I've been playing
violin for 16 years.

678
01:05:03,851 --> 01:05:09,850
I've been studying for 3 years. I'm about to graduate
from one of the finest music schools in London.

679
01:05:10,009 --> 01:05:12,729
I think we should go home.

680
01:05:16,570 --> 01:05:18,250
You coming?

681
01:05:31,172 --> 01:05:32,169
Yeah.

682
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,295
What are you doing?

683
01:06:07,453 --> 01:06:11,658
Just a small surprise.
Something you're going to love.

684
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:13,698
Okay.

685
01:06:22,257 --> 01:06:23,657
I don't think
there's enough time.

686
01:06:23,775 --> 01:06:24,898
Don't be silly.

687
01:06:25,419 --> 01:06:27,616
Maybe we should go back
to the apartment.

688
01:06:36,179 --> 01:06:38,056
Come on. You said you've
always wanted to do this.

689
01:06:38,179 --> 01:06:41,420
And you know why I haven't?
Because I'm scared of heights.

690
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:46,299
Baby, there's nothing to be
afraid of. I'll be with you.

691
01:06:49,337 --> 01:06:50,657
The doors.

692
01:07:02,099 --> 01:07:03,901
It's beautiful.

693
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:10,903
Still scared?

694
01:07:13,143 --> 01:07:16,261
That's weird.
I guess I forgot.

695
01:07:17,741 --> 01:07:20,981
Hey, I'm sorry for being
such a big girl's blouse.

696
01:07:28,022 --> 01:07:29,141
What?

697
01:07:29,864 --> 01:07:31,262
Where did you get that from?

698
01:07:31,386 --> 01:07:34,222
Lottie. Did I use it right?

699
01:07:34,343 --> 01:07:36,144
It couldn't have been better.

700
01:07:40,903 --> 01:07:42,106
Thank you.

701
01:07:43,304 --> 01:07:44,425
What for?

702
01:07:44,543 --> 01:07:47,385
The perfect day.

703
01:07:52,308 --> 01:07:56,224
I think I'll wear this to dinner.
You're going to love the singing tonight.

704
01:07:56,347 --> 01:07:59,265
Is it that opera
that I'm so fond of?

705
01:08:02,028 --> 01:08:04,269
I'd rather stay here
and listen to you sing.

706
01:08:04,428 --> 01:08:05,828
Be serious.

707
01:08:08,109 --> 01:08:12,188
I am. I don't understand why you
don't let people hear your songs.

708
01:08:12,305 --> 01:08:16,708
What are you afraid of?
Success or failure?

709
01:08:17,871 --> 01:08:18,908
Yes.

710
01:08:19,707 --> 01:08:20,628
Sam.

711
01:08:20,746 --> 01:08:22,952
I will sing them. I will.

712
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:24,386
When?

713
01:08:24,511 --> 01:08:27,148
One day. Someday.

714
01:08:33,351 --> 01:08:34,547
Have you seen my keys?

715
01:08:34,672 --> 01:08:37,069
- Your...?
- Keys. I just had them.

716
01:08:40,632 --> 01:08:44,827
It's alright. I've got them.
I've got to run by the office.

717
01:08:44,952 --> 01:08:47,431
The office? Now?

718
01:08:48,592 --> 01:08:51,832
I wasn't there all afternoon.
The place could crumble without me.

719
01:08:53,794 --> 01:08:55,274
It'll just take a second.

720
01:08:57,432 --> 01:08:58,351
See you there.

721
01:08:59,152 --> 01:09:00,193
Yeah.

722
01:09:09,953 --> 01:09:12,515
Hi. I need 75 copies and
I'll be back in a couple of minutes.

723
01:09:12,634 --> 01:09:13,753
No problem.

724
01:11:21,569 --> 01:11:22,964
Ladies and gentlemen...

725
01:11:23,085 --> 01:11:25,246
that was to have been the last
performance of the evening,

726
01:11:25,409 --> 01:11:29,284
but we have a very
special treat for you.

727
01:11:29,884 --> 01:11:32,648
Samantha Andrews,
a visiting artist from America...

728
01:11:32,768 --> 01:11:35,727
has agreed to grace us with
one of her own compositions.

729
01:11:39,607 --> 01:11:40,730
Samantha.

730
01:11:51,971 --> 01:11:54,171
You don't want to let down
your future fans.

731
01:11:56,530 --> 01:11:58,809
You are in big trouble.

732
01:12:53,413 --> 01:12:59,135
# Today, today I bet my life

733
01:12:59,255 --> 01:13:02,856
# You have no idea...

734
01:13:03,018 --> 01:13:07,298
# What I feel inside

735
01:13:08,776 --> 01:13:14,298
# Don't be afraid to let it show

736
01:13:14,417 --> 01:13:18,137
# For you never know

737
01:13:18,259 --> 01:13:24,177
# If you let it out

738
01:13:26,338 --> 01:13:30,219
# I love you, you love me

739
01:13:30,376 --> 01:13:33,899
# Take this gift and don't ask why

740
01:13:34,018 --> 01:13:37,616
# Cause if you will let me

741
01:13:37,738 --> 01:13:41,461
# I'll take what scares you
# hold it deep inside

742
01:13:41,581 --> 01:13:45,300
# And if you ask me why...

743
01:13:45,423 --> 01:13:53,781
# I'm with you
# and why I'll never leave

744
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:58,303
# Love'll show you everything

745
01:14:03,503 --> 01:14:10,985
# One day
# when youth is just a memory

746
01:14:11,103 --> 01:14:22,985
# I know you'll be standing
# right next to me

747
01:14:23,102 --> 01:14:27,385
# I love you, you love me

748
01:14:27,506 --> 01:14:30,945
# Take this gift and don't ask why

749
01:14:31,064 --> 01:14:34,784
# Cause if you will let me...

750
01:14:34,906 --> 01:14:38,547
# I'll take what scares you
hold it deep inside

751
01:14:38,666 --> 01:14:42,546
# And if you ask me why...

752
01:14:42,705 --> 01:14:51,228
# I love you and why I'll never leave

753
01:14:51,350 --> 01:14:58,706
# My love'll show you every-thing

754
01:14:58,864 --> 01:15:07,191
# My love'll show you everything

755
01:15:07,308 --> 01:15:16,187
# My love will show you every-thing

756
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:21,389
# Our love will show us everything.

757
01:16:07,154 --> 01:16:08,554
I can't believe you did that!

758
01:16:08,676 --> 01:16:12,314
What an amazing feeling! Do you
have any idea how terrified I was?

759
01:16:12,432 --> 01:16:14,391
You certainly didn't show it.
You were great.

760
01:16:14,558 --> 01:16:17,075
In the beginning
I couldn't even breathe...

761
01:16:17,234 --> 01:16:21,033
and then this calm came over me.
My god, what an amazing feeling!

762
01:16:21,154 --> 01:16:22,395
You were so incredible.

763
01:16:22,515 --> 01:16:23,715
You're biased.

764
01:16:24,632 --> 01:16:26,232
Guilty as charged.

765
01:16:27,675 --> 01:16:29,474
Hey, I'm starved.
Where are we going to eat?

766
01:16:29,595 --> 01:16:31,035
Anywhere you want to.

767
01:16:31,156 --> 01:16:32,757
Okay.

768
01:16:34,118 --> 01:16:38,796
You like this place? I thought
you'd hate it. Cozy, intimate...

769
01:16:38,918 --> 01:16:40,715
It's exactly my style.

770
01:16:43,436 --> 01:16:45,878
You looked really cute
today in your meeting.

771
01:16:48,238 --> 01:16:52,918
I mean, strong and manly.

772
01:16:54,757 --> 01:16:55,798
What are you saying?

773
01:16:55,919 --> 01:16:59,998
You strong like bull.

774
01:17:01,122 --> 01:17:04,321
But you didn't come to work today.
I mean, I didn't see you.

775
01:17:04,478 --> 01:17:07,523
I brought you the blue folder
but you already had it...

776
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:08,960
so I slipped away.

777
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:15,001
You did look really cute
by the way.

778
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:23,243
Close your eyes.

779
01:17:36,804 --> 01:17:38,405
Happy graduation.

780
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:41,406
Oh my God.

781
01:17:43,002 --> 01:17:45,087
Some of the charms are old
and some are new.

782
01:17:47,203 --> 01:17:50,845
That's a musical note.
A violin. This one's a flower.

783
01:17:50,965 --> 01:17:55,325
But there's no sense in that at all,
except it was exquisite, like you.

784
01:18:00,083 --> 01:18:03,686
Let's see.
The train that we took today.

785
01:18:04,605 --> 01:18:09,166
That's the Eiffel tower that
you've always wanted to see.

786
01:18:12,089 --> 01:18:15,406
And there's a frying pan.

787
01:18:17,169 --> 01:18:21,288
You're the only person I know that
can actually do the flipping thing.

788
01:18:26,487 --> 01:18:27,970
This one's a heart.

789
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:30,768
My heart.

790
01:18:35,129 --> 01:18:36,610
It's yours now.

791
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:53,929
Are you ready?

792
01:18:54,449 --> 01:18:55,572
You sure we can't walk?

793
01:18:55,690 --> 01:18:59,609
It's pouring rain, silly.
Here we go.

794
01:19:06,370 --> 01:19:08,051
Wait!

795
01:19:25,655 --> 01:19:26,694
What?

796
01:19:32,775 --> 01:19:33,976
I love you.

797
01:19:34,097 --> 01:19:35,813
I love you, too.

798
01:19:37,417 --> 01:19:39,375
I want to tell you
why I love you.

799
01:19:40,093 --> 01:19:42,737
It's raining.
You know that, right?

800
01:19:45,296 --> 01:19:48,417
I have to tell you this
and you need to hear it.

801
01:19:52,376 --> 01:19:55,134
I've loved you since I met you...

802
01:19:55,255 --> 01:19:59,055
but I wouldn't allow myself
to truly feel it until today.

803
01:19:59,217 --> 01:20:04,176
I was always thinking ahead.
Making decisions out of fear.

804
01:20:06,497 --> 01:20:11,339
Today, because of
what I learned from you...

805
01:20:13,616 --> 01:20:18,382
every choice I made was different
and my life has completely changed.

806
01:20:19,258 --> 01:20:24,982
And I've learned that if you do that,
you're living your life fully.

807
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:30,459
It doesn't matter if you have
five minutes or fifty years.

808
01:20:36,018 --> 01:20:39,061
Samantha, if not for today,
if not for you...

809
01:20:40,422 --> 01:20:42,980
I would never
have known love at all.

810
01:20:48,863 --> 01:20:52,583
So thank you for being the person
who taught me to love.

811
01:20:54,624 --> 01:20:56,023
And to be loved.

812
01:20:59,823 --> 01:21:01,422
I don't know what to say.

813
01:21:05,303 --> 01:21:07,061
You don't have to say anything.

814
01:21:10,946 --> 01:21:14,102
I just wanted to tell you.

815
01:21:22,664 --> 01:21:23,985
Thank you.

816
01:21:26,508 --> 01:21:27,903
Let's go home.

817
01:21:32,303 --> 01:21:33,626
Are you coming?

818
01:21:38,906 --> 01:21:40,426
Of course.

819
01:21:44,188 --> 01:21:45,908
Ludgate Square, please.

820
01:21:46,508 --> 01:21:47,506
Yes, ma'am.

821
01:22:32,152 --> 01:22:33,631
You haven't got much time.

822
01:22:40,393 --> 01:22:41,914
Anything's possible.

823
01:23:16,794 --> 01:23:18,115
I'm so sorry.

824
01:23:32,281 --> 01:23:33,757
I can't believe he's gone.

825
01:23:35,917 --> 01:23:38,119
Why am I here and he isn't?

826
01:23:38,918 --> 01:23:41,557
Some things are just out
of our control, sweetie.

827
01:23:44,559 --> 01:23:52,599
Ian had a premonition,
or a dream or whatever.

828
01:23:52,723 --> 01:23:54,118
He knew.

829
01:23:56,563 --> 01:23:59,802
And he kept trying to tell me
but I didn't believe him.

830
01:24:03,478 --> 01:24:05,919
Right before we got
into the cab...

831
01:24:06,841 --> 01:24:10,921
he told me about
how I taught him to love.

832
01:24:15,002 --> 01:24:19,003
Loving him was so easy for me.

833
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:25,645
He just wanted
to say everything.

834
01:25:08,806 --> 01:25:12,407
# It'll be all right...

835
01:25:12,525 --> 01:25:17,127
# You said, tomorrow...

836
01:25:18,409 --> 01:25:21,329
# Don't you cry...

837
01:25:21,489 --> 01:25:27,608
# Don't you shed a tear

838
01:25:27,728 --> 01:25:30,491
# When you wake up...

839
01:25:30,609 --> 01:25:36,448
# I will still be here

840
01:25:36,567 --> 01:25:39,251
# When you wake up...

841
01:25:39,369 --> 01:25:44,611
# We'll battle all your fears

842
01:25:44,729 --> 01:25:52,213
# And now I'll...
# take my heart back

843
01:25:52,331 --> 01:25:56,410
# Leave your pictures on the floor

844
01:25:56,531 --> 01:26:01,292
# Steal back my memories

845
01:26:01,452 --> 01:26:05,334
# I can't take it anymore

846
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:09,493
# I've cried my eyes out

847
01:26:10,572 --> 01:26:14,372
# Oh, and now I face the years

848
01:26:14,494 --> 01:26:18,293
# The way you loved me...

849
01:26:20,173 --> 01:26:25,214
# Vanished all the tears

850
01:26:25,453 --> 01:26:30,414
# Just a little more time
# was all we needed

851
01:26:30,535 --> 01:26:35,296
# Just a little more time for me to see

852
01:26:35,417 --> 01:26:39,819
# Oh, the light that life can give you

853
01:26:39,936 --> 01:26:45,577
# Or how it can set you free

854
01:26:45,699 --> 01:26:52,579
# So now I'll take my heart back

855
01:26:53,498 --> 01:26:57,296
# Leave your pictures on the floor

856
01:26:57,419 --> 01:27:02,376
# Steal back my memories

857
01:27:02,498 --> 01:27:06,417
# I can't take it any more

858
01:27:06,539 --> 01:27:11,578
# I've cried my eyes out

859
01:27:11,741 --> 01:27:15,539
# Oh, and now I face the years

860
01:27:15,657 --> 01:27:21,218
# The way you loved me...

861
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:29,182
# Vanished all the tears.
