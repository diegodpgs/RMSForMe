1
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,500
<i>I'm sittin' on top of the world</i>

2
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,080
<i>I'm rollin' along</i>

3
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,460
<i>Yes, rollin' along</i>

4
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,970
<i>And I'm quittin' the blues of the world</i>

5
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,550
<i>I'm singin' a song</i>

6
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,180
<i>Yes, singin' a song</i>

7
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,390
<i>Glory hallelujah! I just told the parson</i>

8
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,310
<i>"Hey, Par, get ready to call"</i>

9
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,270
<i>Just like Humpty Dumpty</i>

10
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,230
<i>I'm gonna fall</i>

11
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,690
<i>And I'm sittin' on top of the world</i>

12
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,480
<i>I'm rollin' along</i>

13
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,900
<i>Rollin' along</i>

14
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,700
<i>Don't want any millions</i>

15
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,120
<i>I'm gettin' my share</i>

16
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,030
<i>I've only got one suit, just one</i>

17
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,280
<i>Move along.</i>

18
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,330
<i>That's all I can wear</i>

19
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,870
<i>A bundle of money</i>

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,330
<i>Don't make me feel gay</i>

21
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,790
<i>A sweet little honey</i>

22
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,300
<i>Is making me say</i>

23
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,800
<i>And I'm sittin', sittin'
on top, top of the world</i>

24
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,470
<i>I'm rollin' along</i>

25
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,640
<i>Rollin' along</i>

26
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,180
<i>And I'm quittin', quittin'
the blues, blues of the world</i>

27
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,770
<i>I'm singin' a song</i>

28
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,350
<i>Yes, singin' a song</i>

29
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,560
<i>Glory hallelujah! I just told the parson</i>

30
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,400
<i>"Hey, Par, get ready to call"</i>

31
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,320
<i>Just like Humpty Dumpty</i>

32
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,950
<i>I'm gonna fall</i>

33
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:50,820
<i>Yeah! I'm sittin' on top, top of the world</i>

34
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,660
<i>I'm rollin' along</i>

35
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,700
<i>Rollin' along</i>

36
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,010
That's a funny one. Isn't that funnier?

37
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,300
It's hysterical, Manny.

38
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,260
As long as we're laughing,
we won't cry over the box office.

39
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,930
Talk about depressing.

40
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,510
Twenty girls in feather boas
prancing around like circus ponies.

41
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,140
That's depressing.

42
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,520
I love a good chorus line.

43
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,150
-What's this?
-It's a play.

44
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,690
Who wrote it, Annie?

45
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,570
Some guy. Driscoll.

46
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,280
Driscoll.

47
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,190
From the Federal Theatre.

48
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,650
Don't knock it, honey.
At least they got an audience.

49
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,240
It'll pick up. Isn't that right, Manny?

50
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,490
It always does.

51
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,500
See you tomorrow.

52
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,670
The trick is to start to build
right from the back of your throat.

53
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,340
Works well out through the nose, too.

54
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,210
Have you eaten today?

55
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,840
I'm not hungry. Don't worry about me.

56
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,130
Hey.

57
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,180
You're all I've got.

58
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,850
Come on, take me to dinner.

59
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,850
Okay.

60
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,060
You think the kitchen will
still be open on Third?

61
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,690
Soup and biscuits. Perfect.

62
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,690
Harry, what's going on?

63
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,200
-Hey, open up! We work here.
-Not anymore, lady.

64
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,870
It's all right for you.
We haven't had a paycheck in two weeks.

65
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,580
How we gonna eat?

66
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,790
-They're not getting away with this!
-They just did.

67
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,290
Ann, it's no use.

68
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,290
The show, it's over. It's done.

69
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,380
I'm done.

70
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,550
I'm leaving, Annie.

71
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,300
I'm going back to Chicago.

72
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,760
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,510
I'm sorry, Annie.

74
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,890
Ever since you were small,
people been letting you down.

75
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,900
You gotta think of yourself now.

76
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,730
You should try out for that part.

77
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,820
Oh, I know what you're thinking.

78
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,780
Every time you reach out
for something you care about...

79
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,570
fate comes along and snatches it away.

80
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,240
But not this time, Annie.

81
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,370
Not this time.

82
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,630
-Oh, hello, Mr Weston.
-Oh, jeez.

83
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,750
Look, miss, I told you already,
call my office.

84
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,750
Leave your résumé with my secretary.

85
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,920
Now, why would I want to do that
when we can talk about it in person?

86
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,590
Because that's what a smart girl would do.

87
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,140
But I already sent you my résumé.
You returned it unopened.

88
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,260
What can I say? Jack Driscoll's very
particular about who he works with.

89
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,970
Please, just an audition.
That's all I'm asking.

90
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,270
Jesus, you don't give up, do you?

91
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,890
Mr Weston, I know this role backwards.

92
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,940
Well, that's too bad, 'cause we just
gave the part to someone else.

93
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,400
I'm sorry, kid. The play is cast.

94
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,150
I know times are tough.

95
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,240
You want my advice?

96
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,610
Use what you got. You're not bad-looking.

97
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,320
A girl like you doesn't have to starve.

98
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,040
There's a new place. It just opened.

99
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,250
Now listen, princess, this gig
ain't the Palace, you understand?

100
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,300
Ask for Kenny K. Tell him I sent you.

101
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,010
Just play the date, take the money...

102
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,970
forget you was ever there.

103
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,040
How much more is there?

104
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,290
Another five reels.

105
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,000
Lights up.

106
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,300
This is it?

107
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,170
This is what we get
for our $40,000, Denham?

108
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,880
Another one of your safari pictures?

109
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:33,050
You promised us romantic scenes with
Bruce Baxter and Maureen McKenzie!

110
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,800
Come on, fellows, you know the deal.

111
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,470
We agreed to push Maureen's start date...

112
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,140
so she could get her teeth fixed.

113
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,020
It's not the principle of the thing,
it's the money.

114
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,640
Carl, you've been in production
for over two months.

115
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,440
Trust me, Bruce and Maureen
are gonna steam up the screen...

116
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,360
once we get them on the ship.

117
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,480
What ship?

118
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,360
The one that we hired to get to the location.

119
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,240
What location? Carl! You're supposed
to be shooting on the back lot.

120
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,820
Yes, I understand that.

121
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,280
But, fellows, we're not
making that film anymore...

122
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,620
and I'll tell you why.

123
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,500
The story has changed.
The script has been rewritten.

124
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,710
Life intervened.

125
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,170
I've come into possession of a map.

126
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,630
The sole surviving record
of an uncharted island.

127
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,840
A place that was thought to exist
only in myth.

128
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,170
Until now.

129
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,260
Whoa, Carl, slow down.

130
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,680
Is he asking for more money?

131
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,350
He's asking us to fund a wild-goose chase.

132
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,850
I'm talking about a primitive world
never before seen by man.

133
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,020
The ruins of an entire civilisation.

134
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,190
The most spectacular thing
you've ever seen.

135
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,730
That's where I'll shoot my picture.

136
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,110
Will there be boobies?

137
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,570
Boobies?

138
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,740
Jigglies. Jiblonkas. Bazooms.

139
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,660
In my experience,
people only go to these films...

140
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,040
to observe the undraped form
of the native girls.

141
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,660
What are you, an idiot?

142
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,960
You think they asked De Mille if he
would waste his time on nudie shots?

143
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,670
No! They respected the filmmaker.
They showed some class.

144
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,170
Not that you'd know what that means,
you cheap lowlife!

145
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,970
Would you step out for a moment, Carl?

146
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,440
Give me that, quick.

147
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,150
You won't like it. It's non-alcoholic.

148
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,320
Preston, you have a lot to learn
about the motion picture business.

149
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,870
Don't write him off, fellows.
He's hotheaded, sure...

150
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,870
but Carl Denham's made
some interesting pictures.

151
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,250
He's had a lot of near-success.

152
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,750
He's a preening self-promoter.

153
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,130
An ambitious no-talent.
The guy's got "loser" written all over him.

154
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,710
I understand your disappointment--
He can't direct.

155
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,420
-He doesn't have the smarts.
-He's washed up.

156
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,220
It's all over town.

157
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,300
This jumped-up little turd's
gonna bankrupt us.

158
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,180
The animal footage has value.

159
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,680
Sure. Universal are desperate
for stock footage.

160
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,140
Then sell it! Scrap the picture.

161
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,600
We got to retrieve something
from this debacle.

162
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,070
Get him back in.

163
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,730
Mr Denham.

164
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,910
I want the cast and crew on the ship
within the hour.

165
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,110
No, Carl, you can't do this.

166
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,370
Tell them the studio pressured us
into an early departure.

167
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,450
-It's not ethical!
-What are they gonna do, sue me?

168
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,620
They can get in line.

169
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,120
I'm not gonna let them kill my film.

170
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,620
You realise that none of
the camera equipment is on board?

171
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,500
We have no permits, no visas.

172
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,210
That's why I have you, Preston.

173
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,380
We have no insurance,
we have no foreign currency.

174
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,380
In fact, we have no currency of any kind.

175
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,550
He's there.

176
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,340
-Get in there.
-Who's gonna pay for the ship?

177
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,510
Get in.

178
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,970
-You get out of there! Come here!
-Step on it! Step on it!

179
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,100
Get out! You're finished, Denham!

180
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,310
Don't worry, Preston.
I've had a lot of practice at this.

181
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,940
I'm real good at crapping the crappers.

182
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,280
Red Label, 80% proof, to be
packed in a crate marked "lemonade."

183
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,450
You got it.

184
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,860
Tell Maureen she doesn't have
six hours to put on her face.

185
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,240
If she wants to be in this picture,
she's gotta be on that boat.

186
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,910
She doesn't wanna be in this picture.

187
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,710
-Maureen pulled out.
-She pulled out?

188
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,870
Yesterday. I told you.

189
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,580
You said we were shooting
in Singapore, right?

190
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,630
That's what you told her.

191
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,710
Yeah, but we're not shooting in Singapore.

192
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,090
God damn it, Preston, all you had to
do was look her in the eye and lie.

193
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,890
I got to get to a phone,
talk to Harlow's people.

194
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,390
She's unavailable.

195
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:55,260
Myrna Loy? Clara Bow? Mae West?

196
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,640
You'll never get her
into a size four.

197
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:01,270
You gotta get a girl
that'll fit into Maureen's costumes.

198
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,860
Fay's a size four.

199
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,440
Yes, she is,
but she's doing a picture with RKO.

200
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,490
Cooper, huh?

201
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,030
I might have known.

202
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,780
You're not listening.
We got to delay the shoot.

203
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,330
Shut production down.
We can't sail tonight.

204
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,830
-Not an option.
-Carl.

205
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,370
I said I'd find a girl.

206
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,710
For God's sake, Preston, think like a winner!

207
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,620
Call Jack. I need that goddamn screenplay!

208
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,540
Defeat is always momentary.

209
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,570
What?

210
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,160
Hey! You gonna pay for this?

211
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,750
Excuse me.

212
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,290
Ma'am, I think you dropped this.

213
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,510
Vaudeville, huh?

214
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,640
I worked vaudeville once.
That is a tough audience.

215
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,510
If you don't kill them fast, they kill you.

216
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,010
Mr Denham...

217
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,060
I want you to know...

218
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,940
that I'm not in the habit
of accepting charity from strangers.

219
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,850
Or, for that matter...

220
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,480
taking things that don't belong to me.

221
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,480
It was obviously
a terrible misunderstanding.

222
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,480
It's just that I haven't been paid in a while.

223
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,990
That's awful.
Anyway, Ann.... May I call you Ann?

224
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,450
You wouldn't happen to be
a size four, by any chance?

225
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,000
No, no. Oh, God, no.

226
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,620
You've got me all wrong.
Miss Darrow, please.

227
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,790
I'm not that type of person at all.

228
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,540
What type of person are you?

229
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,590
I'm someone you can trust, Ann.
I'm a movie producer.

230
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:11,720
Believe me, I am on the level.
No funny business. Please sit down.

231
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,340
Please. Please.

232
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,350
Okay.

233
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,890
Ann, I want you to imagine...

234
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,680
a handsome explorer bound for the Far East.

235
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,020
You're filming in the Far East?

236
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,560
Singapore.

237
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,400
On board ship, he meets a mysterious girl.

238
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,320
She's beautiful, she's fragile, haunted.

239
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:42,070
And she can't escape the feeling
that forces beyond her control...

240
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,030
are compelling her down a road
from which she cannot draw back.

241
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:50,330
It's as if her whole life
has been a prelude to this moment...

242
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:56,040
this fateful meeting that changes everything.

243
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,710
And sure enough,
against her better judgement....

244
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,460
She falls in love.

245
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,220
Yes.

246
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,380
But she doesn't trust it.

247
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,510
She's not even sure if she believes in love.

248
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,220
Really?

249
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,770
If she loves someone, it's doomed.

250
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,230
Why is that?

251
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,230
Good things never last, Mr Denham.

252
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,320
So you're interested.
Good. That's settled, then.

253
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,900
Now, I don't wanna rush you,
but we are under some time pressure.

254
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,410
-Well, I really--
-Ann, I'm telling you...

255
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,820
you're perfect. Look at you.

256
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,910
You're the saddest girl I've ever met.

257
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:41,080
You're gonna make them weep, Ann.
You're gonna break their hearts.

258
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,420
See, that's where you're wrong, Mr Denham.

259
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,080
I make people laugh, that's what I do.

260
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,750
Good luck with your picture.

261
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,130
Ann? Miss Darrow, please!

262
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,590
I'm offering you money.

263
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,340
Adventure, fame, the thrill of
a lifetime, and a long sea voyage.

264
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,510
You want to read a script?

265
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,640
Jack Driscoll's turning in a draft
as we speak.

266
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,020
Jack Driscoll?

267
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,440
Sure. Why?

268
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,480
Wait. You know him?

269
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,110
No, not personally. I've seen his plays.

270
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,190
What a writer, huh?
And let me tell you, Ann...

271
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,280
Jack Driscoll does not want just
anyone starring in this picture.

272
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,740
He said to me, "Carl...

273
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:26,160
"somewhere out there
is a woman born to play this role."

274
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,620
And as soon as I saw you, I knew.

275
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,290
Knew what?

276
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,540
It was always going to be you.

277
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,050
How much do I owe you?
Make it a quarter.

278
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,720
Keep the change.

279
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,560
Is this the moving picture ship?

280
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,560
Not exactly.

281
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,060
It's actually this one over here.

282
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:15,740
Don't let appearances deceive you.
It's much more spacious on board.

283
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,660
-ls this all of the equipment?
-Yeah.

284
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,830
-This is all of it?
-Yeah.

285
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,490
-We're taking the Bell & Howell?
-Yeah.

286
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,290
-Good. You got all the lenses?
-Sure.

287
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,910
- Carl!
-Yes!

288
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,330
Get it on board, fellows, come on.

289
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,130
It's bad, it's bad.

290
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,130
They're on their way. I've just had word.

291
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,300
-Who?
-Men in uniform.

292
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,470
The studio called the cops.

293
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,970
Englehorn! Cast off!

294
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,970
Hoist up the mainsail, raise the anchor...

295
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,100
whatever the hell it is you do.
We gotta leave!

296
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,810
I cannot do that.

297
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,140
We are waiting on the manifest.

298
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,690
What? Who? English, please.

299
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,810
Paperwork, Mr Denham.

300
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,570
I'll give you another $1,000 to leave now.

301
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,030
You haven't given me the first $1,000 yet.

302
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,280
Can we talk about this later?

303
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,160
Can't you see
we're in the company of a VlP guest?

304
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,290
Ma'am.

305
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,540
Ann Darrow.

306
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,710
So you are ready for this voyage,
Miss Darrow?

307
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,090
Sure.

308
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,210
Nervous?

309
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,760
Nervous? No.

310
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,050
Why? Should I be?

311
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,220
It isn't every woman
who would take such a risk.

312
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:43,310
Why don't I show Miss Darrow to her cabin?

313
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,190
Wonderful idea. Thank you, Preston.

314
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,690
Miss Darrow, if you would just....

315
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:54,070
Hi. My name is Preston. Carl's assistant.

316
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,200
$2,000. It's a deal. Will you take a cheque?

317
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,530
Do I have a choice?

318
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,080
Please follow me.

319
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,410
If there's anything that you....
Excuse me, fellows.

320
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:08,370
If there's anything that you need,
please don't hesitate to ask.

321
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:29,220
Oh, Jesus! Jack, you scared me.

322
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:33,730
Listen. If anyone comes to the door,
don't open it. You haven't seen me.

323
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,390
Say I got depressed and committed suicide.

324
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,650
Say I stuck my head down the toilet.

325
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,650
-You want one?
-No. I can't stay, Carl.

326
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,730
I got a rehearsal for which
I am now three hours late.

327
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,990
-What's this?
-It's the script.

328
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,740
This is a script?

329
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,580
Jack, this is 15 pages.

330
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,290
I know, but they're good.
You've got 15 good pages there, Carl.

331
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,370
I'm supposed to be making
a feature-length picture.

332
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,830
You told me I had more time.
I'm sorry. Look, I gotta go.

333
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,920
No, Jack, you can't do this to me.
I have a beginning...

334
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,630
but I need a middle and an end.
I gotta have something to shoot.

335
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,920
Look, you got my notes.
I got to go, pal. See you.

336
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,890
All right, fine. We might as well settle up.

337
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,760
You're gonna pay me?

338
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,770
I'm not gonna stiff a friend.

339
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,770
I've never known you
to volunteer cash before.

340
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,650
How's $2,000 sound?

341
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,770
Sounds great.

342
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,570
I thought it might.

343
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:37,150
-Sounds great.
-Okay.

344
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,830
And voilà.

345
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,710
Thanks.

346
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,590
You've written "two grand."

347
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,420
So I did. Sorry about that.
Let's start from the beginning.

348
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,180
"Two thousand dollars."

349
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,770
It is the 29th, isn't it?

350
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:19,600
Oh, come on, it's the 25th. It's the 25th.

351
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,230
God, I'm sorry. It'll just take a sec.

352
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,440
Never mind, Carl.
Just pay me when you get back.

353
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:25,900
All right.

354
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:42,370
Your cabin is the last on the left, Mr Baxter.

355
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,960
And may I just say how excited we
are to have you back with us, sir?

356
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,790
Be a sport and lend a hand here,
would you?

357
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,340
Excuse me. I'm trying to.... I gotta get--

358
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,130
Christ!

359
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,840
Appreciate the help, fellow.

360
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,050
Let me get the door for you.

361
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,300
Welcome to your stateroom, sir.

362
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,940
Dead slow ahead both, Mr Hayes.

363
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,940
Dead slow ahead both, Captain.

364
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,280
Oh, Christ!

365
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,080
God damn it!

366
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:44,920
I keep telling you, Jack,
there's no money in theatre.

367
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,470
Oh, no! No!

368
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,680
You're much better off sticking with film.

369
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,350
I don't do it for the money, Carl.

370
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:59,980
I happen to love the theatre.

371
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,890
No, you don't.

372
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,190
If you really loved it...

373
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,190
you would have jumped.

374
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,460
This room very comfortable.
Plenty dim light, fresh straw.

375
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,540
Jesus. What do you keep down here?

376
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,960
Lion, tiger, hippo, you name it.

377
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,710
You sell them to zoos?

378
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,380
Zoo, circus.

379
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,300
Skipper get big money for rare animal.

380
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,550
Careful. Camel have bad accident on floor.

381
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,390
Stain unremovable.

382
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,020
Skipper catch any wild animal you want.

383
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,980
He'll do you real good price on white rhino.

384
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,150
Choy.

385
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,820
My apologies for not being able
to offer you a cabin.

386
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,690
Have you found an enclosure to your taste?

387
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,240
Spoiled for choice.

388
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,030
What are you, Mr Driscoll? A lion?

389
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,830
Or a chimpanzee?

390
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,910
I'll take this one.

391
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,550
I told you to lock it up.

392
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:34,140
-Sorry, Skipper. Lumpy said--
-Lumpy doesn't give the orders!

393
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,260
What are you trying to do?
Put the whole ship to sleep?

394
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,390
Get them out of here.

395
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,380
-Compliments of the chef.
-Okay.

396
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,800
Oh, Christ. Oh, God.

397
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,680
Lamb's brains in walnut sauce.

398
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:37,520
Jimmy.

399
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,690
You run those ropes up on deck
like I told you?

400
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,770
Doing it now, Mr Hayes.

401
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:45,990
How about
you return Mr Driscoll's pen first?

402
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,660
He don't mean no harm.

403
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,660
Thanks.

404
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,500
-I'll keep him out of your way.
-It's okay.

405
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,080
It's just that he likes it down here.

406
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:04,750
It's where I found him four years ago.

407
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,670
Stowed away in one of them back cages.

408
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,380
His arm was broken in two places.

409
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,470
He was wilder than half the animals in here.

410
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,970
Still won't tell me where he came from.

411
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,260
But it wasn't anyplace good.

412
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,930
You got to straighten up.

413
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,350
Jimmy.

414
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,190
You don't want to be on this ship
the rest of your life.

415
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,610
-Yes, I do.
-No, you don't, Jimmy.

416
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,190
You got to be smart. Get yourself educated.

417
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,190
Give yourself some options.
Take this seriously!

418
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,360
I do, Mr Hayes, I do. Look.

419
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:43,030
I've been reading.

420
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,660
Where'd you get this?

421
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,290
I borrowed it.

422
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,420
On long-term loan.

423
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,380
Look at this. Look, look.

424
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,710
"Adventures on a tramp steamer."
See? Just like us.

425
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,390
It's so nice to meet you, Mr Driscoll.

426
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,970
I'm actually quite familiar
with your work, yes.

427
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,100
Hello, Mr Driscoll. It's so nice to meet you.

428
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:23,150
Actually, I'm quite familiar with your work.

429
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,440
I'm a huge fan.

430
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,440
I've read everything you've ever written.

431
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,990
No, too much.

432
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,950
Gonna have the ship's engines
all over the dialogue.

433
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,030
Seagulls.

434
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,200
Camera noise. Wind.
Christ knows what else.

435
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,410
I don't care, Mike.

436
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,910
You're the sound recordist. Make it work.

437
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:46,170
Ann! Come on in.
Let me introduce you to the crew.

438
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,420
This is Herb, the cameraman.

439
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,710
-Delighted to meet you, ma'am.
-Likewise.

440
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,920
May I say what a lovely dress?

441
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,880
Oh, this old thing? I just threw it on.

442
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,930
Isn't that one of Maureen's costumes?

443
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:04,060
Now, what does a girl have to do
around here to get some breakfast?

444
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,140
Lumpy, you heard the lady.

445
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:09,680
Fancy my porridge à la walnuts?

446
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,400
Oh, Ann, I don't believe you've met....

447
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,900
Ann?

448
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,530
That's all right, Mr Denham.
I know who this is.

449
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:32,410
Thrilled to meet you.
It's an honour to be a part of this.

450
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,080
Gee, thanks.

451
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:38,580
Actually, I'm quite familiar with your work.

452
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,210
Really?

453
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,090
Yes, and what I most admire...

454
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:46,760
is the way you've captured
the voice of the common people.

455
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,800
Well, that's my job.

456
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,050
I'm sure you've heard this before,
Mr Driscoll...

457
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,600
if you don't mind me saying...

458
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,730
but you don't look
at all like your photograph.

459
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,560
-Excuse me.
-Wait a minute, Ann--

460
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:09,440
He's so much younger in person.
And much better-looking.

461
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,110
Ann, stop. Stop right there.

462
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:13,360
You see, I was just afraid
that you might be...

463
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:16,240
one of those self-obsessed literary types.

464
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,110
-I'm sorry, I'm not--
-You know...

465
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,950
the tweedy twerp with his nose
in his book and his head up his--

466
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,830
It's nice to meet you, too, Miss Darrow.

467
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,140
Good Christ!

468
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,160
She's standing at the railing.
She doesn't know it yet...

469
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:18,910
but they are sailing towards disaster.
You got that?

470
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,830
Okay, so she turns...

471
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:24,000
the first mate is staggering towards her.

472
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,960
There's a knife sticking out of his back.

473
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,970
Wait a sec. We're killing off the first mate?

474
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,680
That's assuming
she knows who the first mate is.

475
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,600
Come on, Jack. It was an honest mistake.

476
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,220
Ann is nearsighted.
It could have happened to anyone.

477
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,890
I was joking, Carl.

478
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:44,270
The point is, she's horrified.
She has to look away.

479
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,110
And that's when she sees it.

480
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,650
Sees what?

481
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,030
What?

482
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:01,910
The island.

483
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:09,870
We're filming on an island now?
When did this happen?

484
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:13,210
Jack, keep your voice down.

485
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:16,250
I don't want the crew getting spooked.

486
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,880
Why would they get spooked?
What's it called?

487
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,970
All right. It has a local name...

488
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:24,550
but I'm warning you, Jack,
it doesn't sound good.

489
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,340
They call it Skull lsland.

490
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,140
Did you get that?

491
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,260
What's wrong with this place?

492
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:34,060
There's nothing officially wrong with it.

493
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:37,640
Because, technically,
it hasn't been discovered yet.

494
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,020
Okay. All right.

495
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,490
So we arrive at this place.

496
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,280
S...

497
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,110
K...

498
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,530
U...

499
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,740
L...

500
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,490
L...

501
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,330
Island.

502
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:11,760
All right, everyone, from the top!
And action!

503
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,970
I think this is awfully exciting!
I've never been on a ship before.

504
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:19,640
And I've never been on one
with a woman before.

505
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,180
I guess you don't think much
of women on ships, do you?

506
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,220
No, they're a nuisance.

507
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:28,940
-Well, I'll try not to be.
-Just being around is trouble.

508
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,280
Cut!

509
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,780
It's great.

510
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:45,120
Bruce, wonderful performance.
You can relax for 10 minutes.

511
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,120
That was very natural. I felt moved.

512
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:51,750
What do you think, Driscoll?
Dialogue's got some flow now, huh?

513
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,620
It was pure effluence.

514
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,460
I beefed up the banter.

515
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,670
Try to resist that impulse.

516
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,960
It's just a little bit of humour, bud.

517
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:02,500
What are you, a Bolshevik or something?

518
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:03,800
Actors.

519
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:08,220
Travel the world,
but all they ever see is a mirror.

520
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,020
Good legs.

521
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,270
Sea legs. Well, you know, sea legs.

522
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,860
Yeah.

523
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:33,570
Not that you don't have good legs.
Just making conversation.

524
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,950
Jesus. Miss Darrow!

525
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,450
About the scene today with you and Bruce--

526
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,330
I know it wasn't what you wrote...

527
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:46,460
but Mr Baxter felt very strongly
that when a man likes a woman...

528
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,750
he must ignore her.

529
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,670
And if things turn really hostile, then....

530
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,750
No?

531
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,550
Interesting theory.

532
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,300
I know. I should have....

533
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,680
It wasn't what I had intended, but--

534
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,260
I'm sorry. I was....

535
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,350
And you made it your own.

536
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,810
I was nervous.

537
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,640
It was funny, actually. You were funny.

538
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,850
Please don't say another word. Good night.

539
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,350
Miss Darrow.

540
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,190
You don't have to be nervous.

541
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,040
Thank you.

542
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,590
Let's take it....

543
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,960
Would you please....
We're trying to shoot a scene.

544
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,670
-Okay.
-Thank you.

545
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,220
Okay, again.

546
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,940
We're close. Turn southwest.

547
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,610
There's no land southwest
for thousands of miles.

548
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:07,070
It takes us way outside the shipping lanes.

549
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,610
I won't sail blind in these waters.

550
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,910
I'll make it worth your while.

551
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,240
There's nothing out there.

552
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,370
Well, then you've nothing to lose.

553
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:35,390
If someone were to tell you this
ship was headed for Singapore...

554
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,600
what would you say?

555
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,470
I would say they're full of it, Mr Hayes.

556
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,980
Well, we turned southwest last night.

557
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,810
Gentlemen, please.

558
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,770
-We're not looking for trouble.
-No.

559
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:55,480
You're looking for something else.

560
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,280
Yes, we are.

561
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:04,330
We're going to find Skull lsland.

562
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,740
Find it, film it, and show it to the world.

563
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:12,500
For 25 cents, you get to see
the last blank space on the map.

564
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,130
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

565
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,050
What do you mean?

566
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,380
Seven years ago, me and Mr Hayes
were working our passage...

567
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,010
on a Norwegian bark.

568
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:26,930
We picked up a castaway.
We found him in the water.

569
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,010
He'd been drifting for days.

570
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,510
His ship had run aground
on an island way west of Sumatra.

571
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,020
An island hidden in fog.

572
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:40,060
He spoke of a huge wall...

573
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,110
built so long ago...

574
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,650
no one knew who'd made it.

575
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,780
A wall 100 foot high...

576
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,860
as strong today as it was ages ago.

577
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,660
Why'd they build the wall?

578
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,750
Well, the castaway, he spoke of a creature...

579
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,290
neither beast nor man...

580
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:10,050
but something monstrous,
living behind that wall.

581
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,460
A lion or a tiger.

582
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,720
A man-eater.
That's how all these stories start.

583
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,590
What else did he say?

584
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,050
Nothing.

585
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:22,850
We found him the next morning.
He'd stuck a knife through his heart.

586
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:26,480
Sorry, fellows.
You'll have to do better than that.

587
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,980
Monsters belong in B movies.

588
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,060
If you find this place...

589
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:36,020
if you go ashore with your friends
and your cameras...

590
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,860
you won't come back.

591
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,360
Just as long as you understand that.

592
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:05,100
How long do you expect us
to stay out here?

593
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,940
You're writing a stage comedy?

594
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,940
I'm writing it for you.

595
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,980
Why would you do that?

596
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,780
-Why would I write a play for you?
-Yes.

597
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,070
Isn't it obvious?

598
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,120
Not to me.

599
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,160
Well...

600
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,500
it's in the subtext.

601
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,460
I guess I must have missed it.

602
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,380
It's not about words.

603
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,500
Message for you, Captain.

604
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:55,520
What's going on?

605
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:59,150
Hayes, why are we changing course?

606
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:02,980
-Englehorn, you can't just--
-Outside.

607
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:09,660
There's a warrant out for your arrest.

608
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:11,620
Did you know that?

609
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,660
I've been ordered to divert to Rangoon.

610
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:24,170
Another week. I haven't got a film yet.

611
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,210
Please. I have risked
everything I have on this.

612
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:31,550
No, Denham. You risked everything I have.

613
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,720
What do you want?

614
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,050
Tell me what you want.
I'll give you anything.

615
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,050
I want you off my ship.

616
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,140
Set a course for Rangoon, Mr Hayes.

617
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:52,190
I'm finished.

618
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:55,530
It's over for me, Jack.

619
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,780
How'd you think this would end, Carl?

620
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,920
Check our position. Use the stars.

621
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,720
There are no stars, Captain.

622
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,560
What is that?

623
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,610
-What?
-That.

624
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:48,240
That right there.

625
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,070
I don't know. What is it? A coffee stain?

626
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,200
Station the forward lookout
and get me the depth by lead line.

627
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:35,990
Aye, Captain.

628
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:49,420
30 fathoms, no bottom!

629
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:54,210
Reduce speed, steerage way only.

630
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:56,840
Dead slow ahead, both.

631
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:01,890
You should stop the ship.

632
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,050
15 degrees port.

633
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:09,680
We're getting out of here, Mr Hayes.

634
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:11,850
We'll find clear conditions.

635
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,060
We have seabed!

636
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,320
25 fathoms!

637
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,650
We're shallowing!

638
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,070
20 degrees starboard!

639
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,200
Captain, you don't know
where the hell you're going!

640
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,910
Get me another reading!

641
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,750
Another reading!

642
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:39,040
22 fathoms!

643
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,630
-Douse the lights.
-Aye, Captain.

644
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,050
10 fathoms!

645
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:10,400
Wall! There's a wall ahead!

646
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,160
Stop engines!

647
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:34,260
Give me some power! Half astern both.

648
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,430
Half astern both, Captain!

649
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:42,180
Rocks!

650
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:46,480
Rocks!

651
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:53,190
Rocks to starboard, Captain!

652
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:56,070
To port! Rocks everywhere!

653
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,820
Take the wheel, Hayes.

654
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,210
Hang on!

655
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:41,020
Full ahead!

656
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,740
Rocks to port, Captain!

657
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:52,490
Turn, Captain!
Starboard, starboard!

658
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:21,480
Shore up that breach!

659
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,230
Get me more men down here now!
Come on, move, move!

660
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,150
-Hayes!
-She's taken a pounding!

661
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,860
What about the prop?

662
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:35,110
The shaft's not bent, as far as we can tell.

663
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,410
But she struck hard against the rock!

664
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:39,660
Captain!

665
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:42,080
Better come up quick!

666
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,370
Right there!

667
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:02,260
Want me to bring them back?

668
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:04,600
I don't give a damn about Carl Denham.

669
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,180
I want this ship fixed and ready
to float on the next high tide!

670
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,890
Come on, move it.

671
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,060
We're leaving, Mr Hayes.

672
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,570
Can you believe this, Jack?

673
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,740
We've got our picture.

674
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:28,040
Why does Marlow keep going up the river?

675
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,420
Why doesn't he turn back?

676
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,670
There's a part of him that wants to, Jimmy.

677
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:41,170
A part deep inside himself
that sounds a warning.

678
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:45,090
But there's another part...

679
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:47,970
that needs to know.

680
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:54,020
To defeat the thing which makes him afraid.

681
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:59,230
"We could not understand
because we were too far...

682
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:01,310
"and could not remember...

683
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,900
"because we were travelling
in the night of first ages...

684
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:08,030
"of those ages that are gone...

685
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,950
"leaving hardly a sign, and no memories.

686
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:16,040
"We are accustomed to look...

687
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,290
"upon the shackled form
of a conquered monster...

688
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:23,250
"but there...

689
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:28,380
"there you could look
at a thing monstrous and free. "

690
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:40,640
It's not an adventure story...

691
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:42,850
is it, Mr Hayes?

692
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:46,180
No, Jimmy.

693
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:48,690
It's not.

694
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,580
-It's deserted.
-Of course it's deserted.

695
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:17,080
Use your eyes, Preston. The place is a ruin.

696
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:21,300
Nobody's lived here for hundreds of years.

697
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:38,350
Mr Denham, I think we should go back.

698
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:40,180
I will handle this.

699
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:47,230
Look. Chocolate.

700
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,190
You like chocolate?

701
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:54,650
It's good to eat.

702
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:58,280
You want?

703
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:05,500
Take it.

704
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:15,630
Here, put it in your hand and take it.

705
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,140
For God's sakes, Denham,
leave the native alone.

706
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:26,510
She doesn't want the chocolate.

707
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,080
All right!

708
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:55,950
Just a bunch of women and old folks!

709
00:58:57,790 --> 00:58:59,370
They're harmless!

710
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:22,150
Ann!

711
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:50,720
Jack.

712
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:06,360
Seen enough?

713
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,870
Lighten the ship!

714
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:20,040
Anything that's not bolted down
goes overboard!

715
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:23,870
Just heave it!

716
01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:25,620
We got away.

717
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:27,420
We gotta be grateful for that, gentlemen.

718
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:31,250
What about Mike? He didn't get away!
He's still there!

719
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,260
Mike died doing what he believed in!
He didn't die for nothing.

720
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:39,380
And I'll tell you something else.
I'm gonna finish this film for Mike!

721
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:47,470
I'll finish it...

722
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:51,690
and I'll donate the proceeds...

723
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,190
to his wife and kids.

724
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:58,190
Because that man is a hero,
and he deserves nothing less.

725
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:00,400
Hear, hear!

726
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:41,270
Chuck everything except for the potatoes!

727
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:49,650
-What's wrong now?
-Excuse me, Shakespeare.

728
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:52,530
Come on, men! Come on, hurry!

729
01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:07,160
Drop those spare cables overboard!
Go on, just chuck it!

730
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:26,760
-Where's Ann?
-What?

731
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:27,970
Where's Ann?

732
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:34,480
Ann!

733
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,490
She's free!

734
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,420
Full ahead, both engines!

735
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,130
Ann!

736
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:38,610
No! Stop! Turn back!

737
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:41,200
Stop!

738
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,870
We have to turn back.

739
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,740
They've taken Ann.

740
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:54,580
No!

741
01:05:59,210 --> 01:06:02,260
Kong! Kong! Kong!

742
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:48,340
All hands going ashore! Report to stations!

743
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:52,090
Jump to it! Jump to it, gentlemen!

744
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:57,470
We're doing it, Mr Hayes!

745
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:06,560
Come on, move it!

746
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:25,240
Pull harder!

747
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:28,450
Row! Row!

748
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:29,870
Come on!

749
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:17,830
Kong.

750
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:41,940
Spread out! Find her!

751
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:52,160
Miss Darrow!

752
01:10:52,370 --> 01:10:55,160
-Check up there, Jimmy!
-Everybody stay together!

753
01:10:58,620 --> 01:10:59,620
Ann!

754
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:03,500
She's here somewhere!

755
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:10,050
What in God's name was that?

756
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:18,010
Behind the wall!

757
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,350
Behind the wall!

758
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:13,390
She's gone!

759
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,110
Carl, what is it?

760
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:34,410
You saw something.

761
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:44,420
You can take Hayes and 15 others.

762
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,880
I'll put a guard on the gate until you return.

763
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,420
The rest of you stay with the ship.

764
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:51,630
Choy!

765
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:54,970
Not you, Jimmy.

766
01:12:55,130 --> 01:12:57,220
Come on, Mr Hayes. Look at them.

767
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:59,050
None of them knows
which way to point a gun.

768
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:00,430
Stay here.

769
01:13:00,970 --> 01:13:03,430
-Miss Darrow needs me!
-No!

770
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:10,650
Bring the tripod and all of the film stock.

771
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:13,150
You wanna go with the 6-inch lens?

772
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:16,020
The wide-angle will do just fine.

773
01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:24,950
You got guns. You got food.
You got the ammo.

774
01:13:25,490 --> 01:13:27,240
And you got 24 hours!

775
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:29,120
24 hours?

776
01:13:29,410 --> 01:13:31,540
This time tomorrow, we haul anchor.

777
01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:56,520
Miss Darrow!

778
01:13:58,930 --> 01:14:00,020
Ann!

779
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,810
Miss Darrow!

780
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:14,570
Miss Darrow!

781
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:34,170
What is it?

782
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:45,220
Fire!

783
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:48,310
Cut it out.

784
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,020
Hold your fire.

785
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:53,190
Hold your fire!

786
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:26,380
Stay down, damn it. Stay down.

787
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:44,640
Come on. Come on. Come on.

788
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:18,300
Good shooting, Mr Hayes.

789
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:24,760
Aren't these things
supposed to be extinct?

790
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:26,430
They are now.

791
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:34,770
What the hell kind of a place is this?

792
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,700
Miss Darrow!

793
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:57,500
Ann!

794
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:14,180
No!

795
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:33,910
Ann!
Miss Darrow!

796
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:43,580
Ann!

797
01:18:53,010 --> 01:18:54,090
Ann!

798
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:33,460
Christ, it's a bleeding boneyard!

799
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:37,290
They've been ripped limb from limb.

800
01:19:39,170 --> 01:19:41,590
Ann! Ann!

801
01:19:54,850 --> 01:19:57,100
Just keep walking, Mr Hayes.
Pretend you didn't see me.

802
01:19:57,220 --> 01:19:59,140
-Jesus, Jimmy.
-Hey, I need that!

803
01:19:59,270 --> 01:20:00,480
I'm not giving you a gun!

804
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,560
You were younger than me
when they gave you one!

805
01:20:02,690 --> 01:20:06,190
I was in the Army. I was trained.
I had a drill sergeant.

806
01:20:07,690 --> 01:20:09,820
I wanna help bring her back.

807
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:19,620
Don't make me regret it.

808
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:49,300
Conserve your ammunition!

809
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:00,140
I'm knackered.

810
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,520
I gotta have a breather.
Great idea.

811
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:06,070
Fellows, we don't have time for this.

812
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:08,570
We've lost too much ground already.
Come on, get up!

813
01:21:08,650 --> 01:21:12,070
They're not about to quit on you.
Cut them some slack.

814
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:14,570
All right, you got five minutes!

815
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:16,740
Everybody stay in sight.

816
01:21:20,740 --> 01:21:24,160
Over here. I'm gonna get
a wide shot of the valley.

817
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:55,770
Bloody Nora!

818
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:05,110
Is that what took Miss Darrow?

819
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:12,830
There's only one creature capable
of leaving a footprint that size.

820
01:22:19,290 --> 01:22:21,170
The abominable snowman.

821
01:22:22,790 --> 01:22:25,460
-Yeah, a snowman.
-We dead meat.

822
01:22:26,170 --> 01:22:28,590
It's got to be what, 20, 25 feet?

823
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,130
Carl saw it.

824
01:22:33,510 --> 01:22:35,010
Let's ask him.

825
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:38,350
Denham!

826
01:22:40,890 --> 01:22:42,180
Where'd he go?

827
01:23:02,370 --> 01:23:04,160
Walk forward, Bruce.

828
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:06,500
-What?
-You're the star of this picture.

829
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:09,620
Get into character
and head toward the animals.

830
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:18,380
What the hell kind of a place is this?

831
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,890
Are you sure about this, Denham?

832
01:23:31,390 --> 01:23:33,480
Don't we have a stand-in
for this type of thing?

833
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:36,480
I need you in the shot,
or people will say they're fake.

834
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,730
Nobody's gonna think these are fake.

835
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,410
You're making them nervous.
No sudden movements.

836
01:23:49,490 --> 01:23:50,780
I'm not moving.

837
01:23:56,580 --> 01:23:58,910
Mother of God.

838
01:24:20,850 --> 01:24:22,220
What's this?

839
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:49,910
What is it? What is it? Where's Carl?

840
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,790
Carl? He's up there, filming.

841
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:04,630
Bugger this!

842
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:06,720
Watch out.

843
01:25:12,010 --> 01:25:13,350
Run, Jack!

844
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:19,140
-Holy Christ.
-Go, Jimmy, run!

845
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:21,560
Run, run, run!

846
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:30,030
-Let go!
-I'm not leaving the camera!

847
01:25:30,110 --> 01:25:31,400
Let go, you idiot!

848
01:25:31,490 --> 01:25:33,320
Carl, run!

849
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:48,000
Look out!

850
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:49,880
Look out!

851
01:26:40,170 --> 01:26:41,710
Coming through!

852
01:27:45,970 --> 01:27:47,010
No!

853
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:48,970
Come on.

854
01:28:30,130 --> 01:28:32,840
Carl! Carl!

855
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:38,560
Get up! Come on. Come on.

856
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:56,030
Mr Denham! Mr Denham!

857
01:28:56,740 --> 01:28:59,360
Herb! Herb, come on!

858
01:28:59,450 --> 01:29:01,160
Take the tripod!

859
01:29:01,370 --> 01:29:02,620
Come on!

860
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:06,370
I'm pulling you up! Hold on to your end!

861
01:29:06,450 --> 01:29:07,500
Go!

862
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:09,250
No, I'm not going anywhere without you!

863
01:29:09,910 --> 01:29:12,580
-You gotta leave me!
-Shut up and hold on!

864
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:22,060
Jimmy, do a head count.

865
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:24,640
I want to know how many are injured
and how bad.

866
01:30:24,730 --> 01:30:25,980
Injured?

867
01:30:27,390 --> 01:30:29,150
Four of us are dead!

868
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:37,610
It's not your fault.

869
01:30:38,070 --> 01:30:40,780
What happened to Herb is no one's fault.

870
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:43,620
You're absolutely right, Preston.

871
01:30:44,030 --> 01:30:46,450
And I'll tell you something else.

872
01:30:46,530 --> 01:30:48,790
Herbert didn't die for nothing.

873
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:52,000
He died for what he believed in,
and I'm gonna honour that.

874
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:56,130
He died believing there was still
some mystery left in this world.

875
01:30:56,630 --> 01:30:59,210
And we could all have a piece of it...

876
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:01,960
for the price of an admission ticket.

877
01:31:02,170 --> 01:31:05,880
God damn it, Preston, we're gonna
finish this film for Herb.

878
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:07,970
We'll finish it...

879
01:31:08,050 --> 01:31:10,970
and donate the proceeds
to his wife and kids.

880
01:31:18,310 --> 01:31:20,480
Come on, guys. We need more rope.

881
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:24,400
All right, we gotta get back to the ship.

882
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:28,150
-Englehorn sails in nine hours.
-So? We gotta find Miss Darrow.

883
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:30,860
Hey, do you hear me?
We're gonna be stranded here.

884
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:36,120
Miss Darrow was a great gal, no question.

885
01:31:36,580 --> 01:31:38,330
And she was a wonderful person.

886
01:31:38,410 --> 01:31:41,620
It's a terrible loss
and we're all gonna miss her.

887
01:31:41,910 --> 01:31:45,830
I always knew you were nothing like
the tough guy you play on screen.

888
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:47,630
I just never figured you for a coward.

889
01:31:47,710 --> 01:31:49,840
Hey, pal! Hey, wake up.

890
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:52,840
Heroes don't look like me,
not in the real world.

891
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:56,470
In the real world, they got bad teeth,
a bald spot, and a beer gut.

892
01:31:56,550 --> 01:32:00,050
I'm just an actor with a gun,
who's lost his motivation.

893
01:32:01,510 --> 01:32:03,010
Be seeing you.

894
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:05,600
Anyone else?

895
01:32:07,140 --> 01:32:09,100
-Well, see you.
-Come on.

896
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:06,970
No!

897
01:37:07,630 --> 01:37:09,090
I said no!

898
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:20,310
That's all there is. There isn't any more.

899
01:39:42,510 --> 01:39:45,300
Get them off the boat.
Get them off the boat.

900
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:49,060
Keep paddling.

901
01:40:27,010 --> 01:40:28,930
What the hell was that?

902
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:12,340
Come on. Get them out of there!

903
01:41:14,130 --> 01:41:15,470
Preston!

904
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:22,260
Give me your hand.

905
01:41:22,850 --> 01:41:24,060
Jack!

906
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:30,810
Jack!

907
01:41:35,610 --> 01:41:36,900
-Choy!
-Help!

908
01:41:36,990 --> 01:41:39,030
Swim, you filthy bugger.

909
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,500
Choy!

910
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:52,420
Stay with him.

911
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:53,920
Swim to shore as fast as you can!

912
01:42:54,010 --> 01:42:55,090
Hold on. Preston!

913
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:58,130
Whatever happens,
don't let go of the camera!

914
01:42:58,220 --> 01:42:59,800
Don't let go of the camera!

915
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:09,390
Come on, get up out of that water.

916
01:43:10,890 --> 01:43:12,190
Get up!

917
01:43:51,970 --> 01:43:53,470
Come on, come on.

918
01:44:05,810 --> 01:44:07,770
Preston. Preston.

919
01:44:19,450 --> 01:44:20,660
It's working.

920
01:44:39,010 --> 01:44:41,010
Did you get that, did you?

921
01:45:41,350 --> 01:45:42,680
No!

922
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:44,690
No.

923
01:45:48,980 --> 01:45:50,060
No.

924
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:41,820
What is it?

925
01:46:46,360 --> 01:46:47,690
Mr Hayes?

926
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:53,820
If anything happens, I want you to run.

927
01:46:54,330 --> 01:46:55,830
You understand?

928
01:46:56,120 --> 01:46:59,330
I'm not a coward. I ain't gonna run.

929
01:47:00,660 --> 01:47:03,120
It's not about being brave, Jimmy.

930
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:32,520
Go back!

931
01:47:34,230 --> 01:47:35,900
Back across the log!

932
01:47:35,980 --> 01:47:38,690
-I ain't gonna run!
-Get Jimmy out of here!

933
01:47:38,780 --> 01:47:40,450
-No!
-Get back! Get back!

934
01:47:44,870 --> 01:47:46,200
Move back!

935
01:47:59,170 --> 01:48:01,550
-No! No!
-Stay back.

936
01:48:04,050 --> 01:48:05,130
No!

937
01:48:10,470 --> 01:48:11,890
Look at me.

938
01:48:14,060 --> 01:48:16,640
-Let him go!
-You got to run, Jimmy.

939
01:48:20,850 --> 01:48:22,350
Do as I say.

940
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:24,900
Go with Jack.

941
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:28,820
Run!

942
01:48:31,990 --> 01:48:34,410
-No!
-Shoot him!

943
01:48:51,880 --> 01:48:54,670
Here! Over here!

944
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:14,860
Hold on! Hold on!

945
01:49:18,940 --> 01:49:21,570
Lumpy! Help me!

946
01:49:23,450 --> 01:49:24,860
Bloody hell, Choy!

947
01:54:46,460 --> 01:54:47,540
No!

948
01:54:51,710 --> 01:54:52,920
Oh, my!

949
02:01:28,280 --> 02:01:29,620
Wait!

950
02:02:19,070 --> 02:02:20,320
Carl.

951
02:02:25,290 --> 02:02:27,000
Jimmy. Jimmy.

952
02:02:29,710 --> 02:02:31,170
You all right?

953
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:22,370
No.

954
02:04:14,460 --> 02:04:16,500
Get off! Get it off!

955
02:04:24,050 --> 02:04:25,180
Get off!

956
02:04:39,020 --> 02:04:40,400
Get it off!

957
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:42,520
Get it off! Get it off!

958
02:05:45,950 --> 02:05:47,240
Kill it!

959
02:05:59,170 --> 02:06:00,590
Stop moving!

960
02:06:20,640 --> 02:06:22,350
Get it off my face!

961
02:06:23,310 --> 02:06:25,730
-Stay still.
-I am standing still.

962
02:06:28,230 --> 02:06:30,030
-Hold on.
-Be careful!

963
02:07:04,850 --> 02:07:07,510
Don't move!
Stay away from the walls!

964
02:07:08,180 --> 02:07:09,680
Coming through!

965
02:07:18,150 --> 02:07:20,730
Get out of there now! Climb!

966
02:07:28,200 --> 02:07:30,030
Nobody get in my way.

967
02:07:32,990 --> 02:07:34,750
Come on, Jimmy. Let's go.

968
02:07:34,830 --> 02:07:37,710
Get up the rope. Let's go. Hurry up.

969
02:08:04,020 --> 02:08:06,100
Jimmy, let's go.

970
02:08:10,730 --> 02:08:12,320
-Come on.
-Okay.

971
02:08:15,530 --> 02:08:16,650
Go.

972
02:08:21,490 --> 02:08:23,370
Just as you go down...

973
02:08:24,410 --> 02:08:26,700
for the third and final time...

974
02:08:27,750 --> 02:08:30,670
as your head disappears
beneath the waves...

975
02:08:31,250 --> 02:08:33,670
and your lungs fill with water...

976
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:38,210
do you know what happens in those
last precious seconds before you drown?

977
02:08:38,460 --> 02:08:41,340
Come on, buddy. Get up the rope.
Come on. Get out of here. Come on.

978
02:08:41,420 --> 02:08:44,090
Your whole life passes before your eyes.

979
02:08:44,180 --> 02:08:46,640
And if you've lived as a true American...

980
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:48,760
you get to watch it all in colour.

981
02:08:49,970 --> 02:08:51,600
Oh, and you will.

982
02:08:51,680 --> 02:08:54,350
Now, why don't you climb up the rope, huh?
Come on.

983
02:08:59,560 --> 02:09:01,650
Come on, Driscoll. Let's go.

984
02:11:56,290 --> 02:11:57,830
It's beautiful.

985
02:12:19,270 --> 02:12:20,600
Beautiful.

986
02:12:32,110 --> 02:12:33,450
Beautiful.

987
02:13:20,820 --> 02:13:22,030
There.

988
02:13:25,110 --> 02:13:28,200
-Thank God.
-Don't thank God. Thank Mr Baxter.

989
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:30,660
He insisted on a rescue mission.

990
02:13:31,660 --> 02:13:35,120
Me? I knew you'd be okay.

991
02:13:36,410 --> 02:13:38,660
That's the thing about cockroaches.

992
02:13:38,750 --> 02:13:42,170
No matter how many times
you flush them down the toilet...

993
02:13:42,250 --> 02:13:44,750
they always crawl back up the bowl.

994
02:13:45,670 --> 02:13:48,510
Hey, buddy? I'm out of the bowl.

995
02:13:49,300 --> 02:13:52,550
I'm drying off my wings
and trekking across the lid.

996
02:13:59,890 --> 02:14:01,140
Driscoll!

997
02:14:02,600 --> 02:14:06,270
Don't be a fool! Give it up. It's useless!

998
02:14:07,520 --> 02:14:08,900
She's dead.

999
02:14:11,690 --> 02:14:13,280
She's not dead.

1000
02:14:17,200 --> 02:14:19,410
Jack's gonna bring her back...

1001
02:14:20,370 --> 02:14:22,990
and the ape will be hard on his heels.

1002
02:14:23,700 --> 02:14:26,410
We can still come out of this thing okay.

1003
02:14:28,830 --> 02:14:30,370
More than okay.

1004
02:14:31,620 --> 02:14:33,210
Think about it.

1005
02:14:33,290 --> 02:14:36,960
You got a boat full of chloroform
we could put to good use.

1006
02:14:37,050 --> 02:14:38,920
You wanna trap the ape?

1007
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:47,390
I don't think so.

1008
02:14:47,970 --> 02:14:51,390
Isn't that what you do? Live animal capture?

1009
02:14:52,890 --> 02:14:54,930
I heard you were the best.

1010
02:15:02,770 --> 02:15:03,900
Jack!

1011
02:15:06,990 --> 02:15:08,740
Look after yourself!

1012
02:15:09,400 --> 02:15:11,320
Keep the gate open, will you?

1013
02:15:11,410 --> 02:15:13,070
Sure thing, buddy.

1014
02:15:13,830 --> 02:15:15,160
Good luck!

1015
02:15:28,420 --> 02:15:29,800
I'm sorry.

1016
02:18:08,630 --> 02:18:09,720
Ann.

1017
02:19:18,230 --> 02:19:19,320
Jack!

1018
02:19:20,190 --> 02:19:21,320
Run!

1019
02:19:51,590 --> 02:19:53,220
Jack, Jack!

1020
02:20:00,930 --> 02:20:02,100
Jack.

1021
02:20:11,150 --> 02:20:13,110
Ann, it's okay.

1022
02:20:14,030 --> 02:20:16,400
Ann, let's go. Let's go. Come on!

1023
02:20:29,620 --> 02:20:31,250
Let's go. Come on.

1024
02:20:31,710 --> 02:20:32,960
Come on!

1025
02:22:05,200 --> 02:22:06,280
Carl!

1026
02:22:06,450 --> 02:22:09,370
Please! Somebody help us!

1027
02:22:11,290 --> 02:22:12,790
They've gone.

1028
02:22:14,330 --> 02:22:16,420
Carl. Christ.

1029
02:22:16,960 --> 02:22:18,080
Carl!

1030
02:22:18,920 --> 02:22:21,090
Drop the bridge.
Do it now, for Christ's sake!

1031
02:22:21,170 --> 02:22:22,380
Not yet.

1032
02:22:23,800 --> 02:22:24,920
Wait.

1033
02:22:25,590 --> 02:22:26,680
Wait.

1034
02:22:30,800 --> 02:22:31,930
Wait!

1035
02:22:42,650 --> 02:22:43,860
Come on!

1036
02:23:56,330 --> 02:23:57,830
-Now!
-Throw them!

1037
02:23:57,920 --> 02:23:59,290
Throw!

1038
02:24:00,170 --> 02:24:01,210
No!

1039
02:24:03,550 --> 02:24:04,800
Hold him!

1040
02:24:04,880 --> 02:24:06,880
Are you out of your mind?

1041
02:24:15,050 --> 02:24:17,220
-Stop!
-Hold the line!

1042
02:24:17,930 --> 02:24:19,350
Keep him down!

1043
02:24:25,060 --> 02:24:26,560
Heave!

1044
02:24:26,940 --> 02:24:28,270
Please!

1045
02:24:28,730 --> 02:24:30,440
No! Stop!

1046
02:24:30,780 --> 02:24:31,860
Jack.

1047
02:24:33,490 --> 02:24:34,820
-No.
-Get her out of....

1048
02:24:34,900 --> 02:24:36,570
-They'll kill him!
-There's nothing we can do.

1049
02:24:36,660 --> 02:24:38,110
-No!
-Get her out of his sight!

1050
02:24:38,200 --> 02:24:40,120
-It's too late.
-Throw it!

1051
02:24:42,410 --> 02:24:43,490
Look out!

1052
02:24:45,790 --> 02:24:47,290
Let go of me.

1053
02:24:51,420 --> 02:24:53,040
We gotta go. Come on.

1054
02:24:53,630 --> 02:24:54,790
-Come on.
-Stop it.

1055
02:24:54,880 --> 02:24:56,420
Leave me alone!

1056
02:24:57,590 --> 02:24:59,130
Ann, please come on.

1057
02:25:06,430 --> 02:25:08,260
-Kill it!
-No. No!

1058
02:25:08,470 --> 02:25:10,720
It's over, you goddamn lunatic!

1059
02:25:12,930 --> 02:25:14,480
All of you, run!

1060
02:25:14,560 --> 02:25:16,190
Come on. Come on!

1061
02:25:33,160 --> 02:25:34,740
Look out!

1062
02:25:45,500 --> 02:25:47,170
Move it! Move it!

1063
02:25:49,510 --> 02:25:50,880
Come on, come on!

1064
02:25:59,810 --> 02:26:01,430
-Stay there!
-It's me he wants!

1065
02:26:01,520 --> 02:26:03,680
-Please stop this!
-Move! Hold onto her!

1066
02:26:03,770 --> 02:26:06,440
-Ann, go.
-Please, I can stop this!

1067
02:26:06,520 --> 02:26:08,020
-No!
-Ann, stay there!

1068
02:26:10,520 --> 02:26:11,900
Get it out!

1069
02:26:14,650 --> 02:26:16,530
Get the hell out of here!

1070
02:26:16,610 --> 02:26:18,570
-Come on!
-Jimmy, don't be crazy! Come on.

1071
02:26:18,650 --> 02:26:19,950
Don't be crazy.

1072
02:26:21,160 --> 02:26:22,240
Let me go!

1073
02:26:23,580 --> 02:26:25,030
Cast off!

1074
02:26:27,370 --> 02:26:28,620
Come on, Carl!

1075
02:26:30,080 --> 02:26:31,920
-Row!
- Wait.

1076
02:26:32,210 --> 02:26:34,330
Row, God damn it!

1077
02:26:44,550 --> 02:26:45,720
Go back.

1078
02:26:52,640 --> 02:26:53,720
Jimmy, no!

1079
02:27:00,730 --> 02:27:01,770
No!

1080
02:27:18,910 --> 02:27:21,210
No! Don't! Leave him alone!

1081
02:27:21,290 --> 02:27:22,790
Hide out in back!

1082
02:27:44,770 --> 02:27:46,430
-Wait!
-No!

1083
02:27:47,100 --> 02:27:49,730
No! No! Please don't!

1084
02:29:47,910 --> 02:29:50,450
The whole world will pay to see this.

1085
02:29:53,200 --> 02:29:55,200
We're millionaires, boys!

1086
02:29:55,500 --> 02:29:57,710
I'll share it with all of you!

1087
02:29:58,210 --> 02:30:02,710
In a few months, his name
will be up in lights on Broadway!

1088
02:30:04,880 --> 02:30:09,010
Kong! The Eighth Wonder of the World!

1089
02:31:09,890 --> 02:31:11,180
Mr Denham!

1090
02:31:12,270 --> 02:31:14,310
What can I say? What can I say?

1091
02:31:14,390 --> 02:31:15,770
Any comments, Mr Denham?

1092
02:31:17,100 --> 02:31:18,770
The Mayor, thank you.

1093
02:31:19,940 --> 02:31:21,020
Ready.

1094
02:31:21,110 --> 02:31:22,440
What am l?

1095
02:31:22,860 --> 02:31:24,610
Thank you very much.

1096
02:31:28,450 --> 02:31:29,950
Get used to it.

1097
02:31:30,160 --> 02:31:33,330
-Listen, it's great to see you. Ready?
-I'm really appreciating that....

1098
02:31:33,410 --> 02:31:34,870
-Look at you!
-I remember you.

1099
02:31:34,950 --> 02:31:37,950
-You're a lucky guy, Denham.
-Am I a lucky guy?

1100
02:31:38,040 --> 02:31:39,830
Maybe you're the lucky guy.

1101
02:31:53,630 --> 02:31:54,800
Carl!

1102
02:31:56,680 --> 02:31:57,850
-Zelman!
-I told them.

1103
02:31:57,930 --> 02:31:59,350
I know you did and I appreciate it.

1104
02:31:59,430 --> 02:32:01,390
Let's get a shot of this.

1105
02:32:01,930 --> 02:32:03,060
Come on.

1106
02:32:03,810 --> 02:32:06,440
-Big smile.
-Yeah! That's great!

1107
02:32:08,520 --> 02:32:11,440
Look at yourself.
Look at what you've become.

1108
02:32:12,190 --> 02:32:14,690
-No woman is worth this.
-This woman is worth it.

1109
02:32:14,780 --> 02:32:16,780
I don't care what it takes,
I gotta win her back.

1110
02:32:16,860 --> 02:32:18,070
Oh, really?

1111
02:32:18,150 --> 02:32:19,820
She's not gonna buy this for a second.

1112
02:32:19,910 --> 02:32:22,070
Shut up and hand me the grapefruit!

1113
02:32:24,200 --> 02:32:26,870
You're writing a comedy?
Yes, I am.

1114
02:32:27,620 --> 02:32:29,540
I'm writing it for you.

1115
02:32:31,500 --> 02:32:33,370
Why would you do that?

1116
02:32:34,380 --> 02:32:36,750
Why would I write a play for you?

1117
02:32:40,170 --> 02:32:41,800
Isn't it obvious?

1118
02:32:42,050 --> 02:32:43,550
Oh, I'm sorry.

1119
02:32:44,800 --> 02:32:47,010
I couldn't help but overhear.

1120
02:32:50,180 --> 02:32:52,890
So, he took me to
this fancy French restaurant...

1121
02:32:52,970 --> 02:32:55,770
and halfway through the
hors d'oeuvres, he clutches my hand.

1122
02:32:55,850 --> 02:32:58,060
And that's when he told you how he felt?

1123
02:32:58,140 --> 02:33:00,850
-No. He never said it.
-He never said it?

1124
02:33:00,940 --> 02:33:02,900
He probably thought
he didn't need to say it.

1125
02:33:02,980 --> 02:33:04,980
Well, then how does she know that it's real?

1126
02:33:05,070 --> 02:33:08,530
-He said it was not about the words.
-Oh, please!

1127
02:33:08,740 --> 02:33:12,860
If you feel it, you say it.
It's really very simple.

1128
02:33:13,240 --> 02:33:17,530
He said we'd talk about it later.
Only there was no later.

1129
02:33:19,240 --> 02:33:20,910
It never happened.

1130
02:33:21,830 --> 02:33:23,580
That's how it ended.

1131
02:33:23,750 --> 02:33:27,460
He just let you walk away?
He didn't try to save it?

1132
02:33:29,340 --> 02:33:32,710
I honestly believed
things might actually work out...

1133
02:33:33,800 --> 02:33:35,800
which was really very...

1134
02:33:39,090 --> 02:33:40,300
foolish.

1135
02:33:40,550 --> 02:33:43,180
Men. Oh, they'll give you the world...

1136
02:33:43,260 --> 02:33:45,640
but they let the one thing
that truly matters...

1137
02:33:45,720 --> 02:33:47,600
slip through their fingers.

1138
02:33:47,680 --> 02:33:48,940
Typical.

1139
02:33:49,520 --> 02:33:53,190
They're so busy being brave,
they forget to use their brains.

1140
02:33:54,150 --> 02:33:56,070
Romance. Who needs it?

1141
02:34:20,790 --> 02:34:22,130
Thank you.

1142
02:34:22,960 --> 02:34:24,340
Thank you.

1143
02:34:27,260 --> 02:34:28,590
Thank you.

1144
02:34:30,430 --> 02:34:31,760
Thank you.

1145
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:35,470
Ladies and gentlemen...

1146
02:34:36,640 --> 02:34:39,480
I'm here to tell you a very strange story.

1147
02:34:39,930 --> 02:34:42,150
The story of our adventure...

1148
02:34:42,480 --> 02:34:45,690
in which 17 of our party
suffered horrible deaths...

1149
02:34:46,440 --> 02:34:48,150
their lives lost...

1150
02:34:48,690 --> 02:34:50,990
in pursuit of a savage beast...

1151
02:34:51,940 --> 02:34:54,570
a monstrous aberration of nature.

1152
02:34:55,780 --> 02:34:58,490
But even the meanest brute can be tamed.

1153
02:34:58,660 --> 02:35:01,370
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, as you will see...

1154
02:35:01,450 --> 02:35:03,450
the beast was no match...

1155
02:35:03,700 --> 02:35:05,710
for the charms of a girl.

1156
02:35:08,750 --> 02:35:10,630
A girl from New York...

1157
02:35:13,550 --> 02:35:15,340
who melted his heart...

1158
02:35:16,050 --> 02:35:18,920
bringing to mind that old Arabian proverb...

1159
02:35:20,590 --> 02:35:23,970
"And lo, the beast looked
upon the face of beauty...

1160
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:26,930
"and beauty stayed his hand.

1161
02:35:27,970 --> 02:35:31,850
"And from that day forward,
he was as one dead."

1162
02:35:39,650 --> 02:35:43,110
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm going to show you...

1163
02:35:43,240 --> 02:35:46,240
the greatest thing
your eyes have ever beheld.

1164
02:35:47,360 --> 02:35:52,030
He was a king in the world he knew,
but he comes to you now a captive.

1165
02:35:53,240 --> 02:35:54,910
Ladies and gentlemen...

1166
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:59,540
I give you Kong,
The Eighth Wonder of the World!

1167
02:36:08,880 --> 02:36:12,010
Don't be alarmed. It's perfectly safe.

1168
02:36:12,340 --> 02:36:15,760
These chains are made of chrome steel!

1169
02:36:36,530 --> 02:36:38,320
Observe, if you will...

1170
02:36:41,580 --> 02:36:43,530
I am touching the beast.

1171
02:36:43,870 --> 02:36:48,080
I am actually laying my hand
on the 25-foot gorilla.

1172
02:36:55,210 --> 02:36:56,880
Crank them up, fellas.

1173
02:37:16,190 --> 02:37:18,400
And now, we have
in the auditorium tonight...

1174
02:37:18,480 --> 02:37:20,060
a surprise guest.

1175
02:37:20,900 --> 02:37:23,280
The real-life hero of this story.

1176
02:37:23,480 --> 02:37:26,190
The man who hunted down
the mighty Kong!

1177
02:37:27,570 --> 02:37:32,370
The man who risked all to win
the freedom of a helpless female.

1178
02:37:33,530 --> 02:37:35,870
A big hand for Mr Bruce Baxter!

1179
02:37:41,750 --> 02:37:43,580
Thank you. Thank you.

1180
02:37:44,580 --> 02:37:45,920
Thank you.

1181
02:38:13,320 --> 02:38:14,780
He was right.

1182
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:19,860
About there still being some mystery
left in this world...

1183
02:38:20,280 --> 02:38:22,820
and we can all have a piece of it...

1184
02:38:22,950 --> 02:38:25,530
for the price of an admission ticket.

1185
02:38:26,790 --> 02:38:29,830
That's the thing you come
to learn about Carl.

1186
02:38:31,210 --> 02:38:34,620
His unfailing ability
to destroy the things he loves.

1187
02:38:49,050 --> 02:38:51,640
Please remain calm, ladies and gentlemen...

1188
02:38:51,720 --> 02:38:55,020
for we now come
to the climax of this savage ritual.

1189
02:38:55,220 --> 02:38:57,940
The sacrifice of a beautiful young girl.

1190
02:38:58,480 --> 02:39:02,150
Behold her terror as she is
offered up to the mighty Kong!

1191
02:39:03,360 --> 02:39:07,440
A big hand, folks,
for the bravest girl I've ever met!

1192
02:39:08,150 --> 02:39:09,780
Miss Ann Darrow.

1193
02:39:57,400 --> 02:39:59,150
Save me from the beast!

1194
02:40:08,030 --> 02:40:09,240
Help me!

1195
02:40:13,370 --> 02:40:14,870
Where is she?

1196
02:40:15,870 --> 02:40:17,420
-Where's Ann?
-I have no idea.

1197
02:40:17,500 --> 02:40:20,880
I heard he offered her all kinds of
money and she turned him down flat.

1198
02:40:20,960 --> 02:40:25,670
Pack up all my cares and woe

1199
02:40:27,420 --> 02:40:28,880
Here I go

1200
02:40:30,220 --> 02:40:31,890
Singing low

1201
02:40:34,140 --> 02:40:36,180
Bye bye

1202
02:40:38,560 --> 02:40:39,980
Blackbird

1203
02:40:45,230 --> 02:40:49,570
Where somebody waits for me

1204
02:40:51,030 --> 02:40:52,610
Sugar's sweet

1205
02:40:54,070 --> 02:40:55,820
So is he

1206
02:40:58,160 --> 02:40:59,870
Bye bye

1207
02:41:01,990 --> 02:41:04,580
Blackbird

1208
02:41:06,710 --> 02:41:08,040
Here's your story, boys.

1209
02:41:08,120 --> 02:41:11,210
"Beauty and the man
who saved her from the beast."

1210
02:41:26,260 --> 02:41:28,140
We have to get these people out of here.

1211
02:41:28,220 --> 02:41:30,730
Everyone needs to leave, okay? Come on.

1212
02:41:31,930 --> 02:41:34,520
Let him roar. It makes a swell picture.

1213
02:41:35,980 --> 02:41:37,020
Head for the exits.

1214
02:41:37,110 --> 02:41:39,900
Get your own seat, buddy.
You're not having mine.

1215
02:41:47,700 --> 02:41:49,160
Excuse me, fellows.

1216
02:41:49,870 --> 02:41:52,580
Coming through. Coming through, fellows.

1217
02:41:56,120 --> 02:41:59,120
Get me down! Help me, please!

1218
02:42:01,540 --> 02:42:04,460
Somebody! Somebody help me!

1219
02:42:07,840 --> 02:42:10,510
Go! Go! Get out!

1220
02:42:14,470 --> 02:42:15,970
Go! Go!

1221
02:43:50,960 --> 02:43:53,420
There they are. Come on, come with me.

1222
02:44:06,180 --> 02:44:07,850
Go!
Wait for me!

1223
02:44:08,770 --> 02:44:10,150
Go back!

1224
02:44:17,150 --> 02:44:18,400
This way!

1225
02:44:26,200 --> 02:44:27,370
Help!

1226
02:44:35,750 --> 02:44:36,920
No!

1227
02:45:16,660 --> 02:45:19,330
Taxi! Follow that ape.

1228
02:45:19,410 --> 02:45:20,910
Come on, pal, we gotta draw him off.

1229
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:22,790
It's all yours, buddy.

1230
02:45:39,220 --> 02:45:40,890
Better get out of here, lady!

1231
02:46:01,650 --> 02:46:02,900
Come on.

1232
02:46:12,080 --> 02:46:13,200
Buddy!

1233
02:46:14,410 --> 02:46:16,620
Come on. Come on.

1234
02:46:35,430 --> 02:46:36,680
Look out.

1235
02:46:59,490 --> 02:47:00,740
Jesus Christ.

1236
02:52:23,960 --> 02:52:24,880
Fire!

1237
02:52:27,300 --> 02:52:28,380
Stop!

1238
02:52:43,940 --> 02:52:45,400
Listen up.

1239
02:52:45,480 --> 02:52:48,440
This is New York City,
and this is sacred ground.

1240
02:52:48,520 --> 02:52:49,980
You hear me?

1241
02:52:50,610 --> 02:52:53,240
It was built for humans, by humans.

1242
02:52:53,320 --> 02:52:55,650
Not for stinking lice-infested apes.

1243
02:52:55,900 --> 02:52:57,660
The thought of some mutant gorilla...

1244
02:52:57,740 --> 02:53:02,450
crapping all over the streets of this fair city,
fills me with disgust.

1245
02:53:02,540 --> 02:53:04,540
So this is how it's gonna be.

1246
02:53:04,620 --> 02:53:06,960
We find it. We kill it.

1247
02:53:07,040 --> 02:53:10,290
We cut its ugly head off and we ram it up....

1248
02:53:30,310 --> 02:53:32,180
No. No.

1249
02:56:03,390 --> 02:56:04,720
Beautiful.

1250
02:56:11,150 --> 02:56:12,230
Yes.

1251
02:56:14,860 --> 02:56:16,230
Yes, it is.

1252
03:01:09,680 --> 03:01:10,930
Look at that.

1253
03:01:12,770 --> 03:01:13,890
Hey! Hey!

1254
03:01:14,140 --> 03:01:16,100
Nobody past this point.

1255
03:01:17,020 --> 03:01:18,940
You can't go in there!

1256
03:01:23,110 --> 03:01:24,400
Stop him!

1257
03:01:27,490 --> 03:01:29,780
Hey! Get back. You're not allowed up there!

1258
03:01:29,860 --> 03:01:31,490
-What's going on?
-Go!

1259
03:05:13,330 --> 03:05:14,630
No!

1260
03:05:15,800 --> 03:05:18,840
No!

1261
03:05:24,930 --> 03:05:27,550
Please! No!

1262
03:05:27,930 --> 03:05:29,060
No!

1263
03:08:25,700 --> 03:08:27,990
Ann. Ann.

1264
03:09:17,320 --> 03:09:18,620
Move along.

1265
03:09:19,080 --> 03:09:20,990
Just one shot! One shot!

1266
03:09:21,660 --> 03:09:23,750
-Come, come!
-Boys, how about a photo?

1267
03:09:23,830 --> 03:09:24,870
Look at me.

1268
03:09:24,950 --> 03:09:26,710
Come on, watch the camera.

1269
03:09:29,500 --> 03:09:31,040
Come a little closer.

1270
03:09:31,710 --> 03:09:33,880
That's it, folks. Show's over. Step back!

1271
03:09:33,960 --> 03:09:36,170
Clear the area. That's it. Shove off, boys.

1272
03:09:36,880 --> 03:09:38,420
Why'd he do that?

1273
03:09:38,720 --> 03:09:41,220
Climb up there and get himself cornered.

1274
03:09:41,300 --> 03:09:43,600
The ape must have known what was coming.

1275
03:09:43,680 --> 03:09:46,350
He's just a dumb animal.
Didn't know nothing.

1276
03:09:52,560 --> 03:09:55,270
What does it matter? Airplanes got him.

1277
03:09:57,860 --> 03:09:59,820
It wasn't the airplanes.

1278
03:10:04,200 --> 03:10:06,490
It was beauty killed the beast.
