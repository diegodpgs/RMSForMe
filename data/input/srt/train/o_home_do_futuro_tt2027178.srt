1
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,459
Wait, wait...

2
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,036
I need to tell you something.

3
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:24,143
I... I have never ridden
on an airplane.

4
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,739
It's kind of like this...

5
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,457
You shouldn't have done that.

6
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:43,652
Why not?

7
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,189
Because I'm going to suffer.

8
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,535
One day...

9
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,604
you are going
to change the world.

10
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,073
And I will never leave your side.

11
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:06,378
We have our own time

12
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:11,348
MAN FROM THE FUTURE
- We have our own time

13
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:16,395
We have our own time

14
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:22,297
I'm not afraid of the dark

15
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:36,170
But leave the lights on
Now

16
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:42,288
What was hidden
Is what it got hidden

17
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:47,360
And what was promised
Nobody promised

18
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,558
lt was not wasted time

19
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:57,131
We are so young

20
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:02,434
So young

21
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,171
So young

22
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,425
What is reality?

23
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,006
Einstein explained it...

24
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,907
so that even degenerate
brains like yours

25
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,476
could understand.

26
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:40,276
Reality is a thread formed
by time and space.

27
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,016
You haven't paid any bills yet.

28
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,050
Good morning, Mr. Arlindo.

29
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,886
The force of gravity makes
the black holes so heavy

30
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:50,788
that they rip the thread of space,
and therefore, time.

31
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,625
However, black holes...

32
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,786
are the theme ofthe last
dissertation ofthe year.

33
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,363
It is the last chance
to contribute to the holy task...

34
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,999
of making you quit
Physics and Mathematics...

35
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,331
to study more interesting
things, like...

36
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,394
acupuncture...

37
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:07,740
chromotherapy.

38
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,198
Professor? Will acupuncture
be on the test?

39
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:16,374
No... but...

40
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,941
particle accelerator will.

41
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,120
It would help if you would...

42
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,719
stop reading that magazine.

43
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,140
- Who is she?
- Helena. First year of Physics.

44
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,770
But stop drooling,
because she is taken!

45
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:59,948
This publication will be
confiscated under the accusation...

46
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:03,788
of disrupting the class and
the progress of Science in Brazil!

47
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,033
Zero!

48
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,782
Increase the acceleration curve!

49
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,450
Zero, we don't have
enough power

50
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,543
for refrigeration beyond
the fifth level.

51
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,421
We are overheating it,
I'm going to abort!

52
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:29,489
- I forbid you, Panda!
- I'm going to abort!

53
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,922
I forbid you, Panda!

54
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:36,362
Let it be known on the records:
Panda never knew...

55
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:38,364
That you forged my signature!

56
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:40,400
That you did an unauthorized test,

57
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,834
or that you burned out
two university generators?

58
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,104
I just need more power.

59
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:47,907
It is insane to do things
without telling me.

60
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,476
I fought more than anybody
for your project!

61
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:53,045
Because you know
you are going to get rich with it.

62
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,214
This has nothing to do
with money, João.

63
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:56,883
Howmany scientists in the world...

64
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,719
are using a particle
accelerator in a project?

65
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,152
One... you!

66
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,855
Do you knowhowmany rules
I have broken...

67
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:06,259
and howmany lies I have told
to finance your garage laboratory?

68
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,428
Sandra, you may have
given up on Science...

69
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,963
because you won money
on the stock market. You got rich.

70
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:13,199
But you used to be a smart girl.

71
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,301
I want you to tell me
what the damn problem is...

72
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,436
because as far as I know,

73
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,371
I'm creating a newenergy
source here!

74
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:23,336
I know.
And they knowit, too.

75
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,951
They.

76
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,922
I created a technology fund
to finance your converter,

77
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,948
but they got tired of your madness!

78
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:40,693
Say it, you witch!

79
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:43,184
They want to put Steve Webs
in your place.

80
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,502
Steve Webs can't turn on a toaster!

81
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:53,438
They filed a lawsuit claiming
that you have gone mad.

82
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,576
I'm going to the press

83
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:59,212
and say that Americans
are trying to steal...

84
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,314
Brazilian scientific patrimony.

85
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,950
That will only make
our situation worse!

86
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:09,513
Enough! You are a genius. You have
invented something extraordinary.

87
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,892
I believe that more
than even you do.

88
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:20,333
That is why I need you
to behave...

89
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:24,103
like a normal human being
in the next 48 hours,

90
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:28,741
so that I can try to put
things in order. That is all!

91
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,072
Or what?

92
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,076
Or I think your future ends here.

93
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,658
- They invited me to stay.
- Traitor!

94
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,285
But I didn't accepted it.

95
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:50,089
Stupid! You have a wife
and kids to support.

96
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:53,199
The project is yours. What have
I done? I did the engineering!

97
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,801
So... let's take what is ours!

98
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,871
You need authorization
from the university,

99
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,206
the mayor, the governor,

100
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,075
or even from the president,
to get to 100% load!

101
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,511
Those are the people
who want to fire us!

102
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,046
- Do you knowwhat I think?
- No, but I know...

103
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,548
- you are going to tell me.
- It's because ofher.

104
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,782
It's still because of her!

105
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,717
I don't knowwhat you are
talking about.

106
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,952
If this works,

107
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,654
you won't be able
to go back to your little life!

108
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,423
- But I happen to like my little life!
- It's too bad.

109
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,550
Because your little life
is about to end!

110
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,961
You are going to write History!

111
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,430
Even if I agree to this madness,

112
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,599
we don't have enough power.

113
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,726
Yes, we do.
This is Sushi.

114
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,939
Sushi! This kid is not authorized
to be here!

115
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,508
He doesn't have authorization
to be awake at this hour!

116
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,010
Zero, look at me.
What is he doing here?

117
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,546
Access to the city's power
supply, complete.

118
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,537
You havejust passed the class, son.

119
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:46,215
You are sick!
You are sick in the head!

120
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,320
Since when, Doctor Freud?

121
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:52,689
November 22nd, 1991.

122
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,356
November 22nd, 1991.

123
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:05,294
Zero! Zero! Zero!

124
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,702
Why are they doing this to me?

125
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,833
- Because I told them to.
- But you love me!

126
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,305
November 22nd, 1991.

127
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:19,685
Access to the city's power supply...
complete.

128
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:21,754
We can go tojail, Zero, tojail!

129
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:22,888
I will broadcast
this on the web.

130
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,090
I want them to arrest me
tomorrow.

131
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,992
You are going to ruin our carriers.
And for what?

132
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,295
Lt's better if you call her.

133
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,287
- Here, take my phone and call her.
- She doesn't exist!

134
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,296
She never...

135
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,538
existed!

136
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,580
I need your help.

137
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,247
OK!

138
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:57,416
Millions of years ago, the primitive
man rubbed two little rocks together

139
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,690
and lit up a cave.

140
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:05,821
Tonight, humanity will kiss
their energy bill goodbye.

141
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,498
Aligned curves.

142
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,765
Zero, get out of there now!
Get out ofthere now, Zero!

143
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,511
Soon the world will be
powered by the energy form...

144
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,844
we are about to create
here tonight!

145
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,451
- Cut the power.
- He locked the system from the inside.

146
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:29,321
And to prove our invention
is not only revolutionary,

147
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,789
but safe,

148
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,727
I will be positioned
at the center of the event.

149
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,126
Zero, no!

150
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,054
Initiating sequence.

151
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,574
Tonight we will be gods.

152
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,910
Someday you will change the world.

153
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,073
Tonight I'm going
to change the world.

154
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,042
My machine was stolen!
God!

155
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,602
They drugged me.

156
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,078
DANGER

157
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:41,977
Sandra, you executive cow.
You cancelled the telephone!

158
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,883
Bitch.

159
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:00,603
Sir?

160
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:09,210
Sir, wake up!
That's 25 thousand.

161
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:13,046
The meter says 25 thousand.

162
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,387
- 25?
- 25.

163
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:18,584
Thousand? Look...

164
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:24,593
I had a very rough day.
I'm not a tourist!

165
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:29,593
I will give you 50.
It's all I have.

166
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,606
Hey! But this money is not real.

167
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:34,607
Of course it is real!

168
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:38,236
Lt says right here,
underthejaguar: "Real"! "Re-al"!

169
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,213
The key...

170
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,062
Sir, this is a family building.

171
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,164
I know, mister Arlindo.
I've been living here since 1998.

172
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:02,001
Great! Then come back
in seven years.

173
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,559
MisterArlindo, you are...

174
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,867
You haven't paid any bills yet.

175
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,403
Young...

176
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,537
Look, I am going to call the police!

177
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,002
I am going to call the police.

178
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,357
Collor's year.

179
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:28,060
The majorfacts
of the govermentfirstyear...

180
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,392
of the president
that hunts maharajahs.

181
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,965
Zêlia, the Iron Minister.

182
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:38,096
Jet ski, the anti drug combat.
Don't misst it, 91 retrospective.

183
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:43,041
- What day is today?
- Today is Tuesday, the 22nd.

184
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,939
- Of when?
- Of, of, November, sir.

185
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,812
Forthe love of God,
what year is this?

186
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:55,310
We are in 1991, sir.
Anno Domini.

187
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,021
Which means... thank you.

188
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:05,295
November 22nd... 1991.

189
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:09,101
Einstein postulated
that the Universe...

190
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:13,504
is a thread formed
by time and space.

191
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:19,642
However, gravity makes
the black holes so heavy

192
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:24,545
that they rip the thread of space,
and therefore, time.

193
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,344
Hi.

194
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:29,919
Mathematicians, Physicists
and astrophysicists

195
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,624
wrestle with this equation
for years...

196
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:33,989
Hi.

197
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:37,559
- My name is Helena.
- I know.

198
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,188
Your name is João, right?

199
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:43,300
I read your paper
about quantum paradoxes.

200
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,802
- It... It wasn't ready yet.
- No, of course not.

201
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:51,443
You are trying to write
a general equation for the universe.

202
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,835
Lfit was ready yet,
you would change the world.

203
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,238
Helena?

204
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,082
- Because I...
- Let's go?

205
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:00,682
Can we go?

206
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,945
Get out, please!

207
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:04,990
My phone number.

208
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,693
I have heard that you tutor
Quantum Physics.

209
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:11,993
If you have some spare time,
call me, OK? Bye.

210
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:18,560
The superstring theory

211
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:23,504
guarantees the quantum existence
of multiple universes,

212
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:28,380
where every bifurcation caused
by time travel

213
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,441
would result in the creation
of a new reality...

214
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:41,949
I don't have money.

215
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:45,397
It's on the house.
You look like you need it.

216
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,921
Come on, drink, drink...

217
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,006
Woman?

218
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,739
- Woman.
- Recently?

219
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,735
Lt happened a long time ago.

220
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,944
But it will happen again
in 1 hour and 42 minutes.

221
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:09,452
- Is it that precise?
- That precise.

222
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,983
There is nothing
you can do about it?

223
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,398
There is.
But if I do it, maybe I'll die.

224
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,865
Goal!

225
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:28,395
- Can I smoke in here?
- Of course. This is a bar, isn't it?

226
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,641
Lfl change what
is going to happen...

227
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,710
I will be different than what I am.

228
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:40,378
So maybe I will cease to exist.
Understand?

229
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,280
A man can't live in fear.

230
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:48,386
Love, hate are...

231
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,430
concrete.

232
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:56,135
They need to take part in
the general equation ofthe universe.

233
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,330
João, that's beautiful!

234
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,571
You are trying to prove
that love exists.

235
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,172
I knowthat it exists.

236
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:19,821
Helena...

237
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,590
I think this...

238
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,428
should be our last class.

239
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:32,260
You are doing very well
on every test.

240
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:37,169
I'm proud of you.

241
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:39,867
Can we go?

242
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,375
And Ricardo...

243
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,185
is coming to pick you up,

244
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,279
and I don't like the way
he looks at me.

245
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,287
I'm... afraid ofhim.

246
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:58,388
You are right,
but we can't live in fear.

247
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:10,336
You are absolutely right.
You are absolutely right.

248
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,744
I bet you one million that Flamengo
will turn the game around!

249
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,182
Show me the money!

250
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,951
Spot me the money
and I'll share it with you.

251
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,118
I can't lose,
I have seen this game before!

252
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:23,417
No, not this game.
It's being transmitted live.

253
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:26,291
Gaúcho will tie the game.
Look at the TV.

254
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,418
Gaúcho appears,
sees the Flamento draw...

255
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,329
Come on, place the bet!

256
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,066
One million!
Flamengo five to three!

257
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,954
Why are you doing this to me?

258
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,389
You bastard!

259
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,457
Antônio Carlos, who is that cow?

260
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:35,255
Honey, calm down!
I can explain everything.

261
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,396
- Bastard.
- What time is it?

262
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,598
I don't know. I'm having an
argument with my boyfriend!

263
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,433
Sandra, the band is wrapping up.

264
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,025
Go back to the stage!

265
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,235
João?

266
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,072
João! What happened?

267
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:49,472
What did you do with
your hair? You look awful!

268
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:17,958
I was never here. You never sawme.
You never sawme!

269
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:29,808
Lt was the nun. She was taking care
oftriplets at the orphanage.

270
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:33,775
Then, she was inserting
a suppository in them, right?

271
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,009
Thank you forthe costume...

272
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:09,384
but I can't go
to this party with you.

273
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:13,313
Why are you running from me?

274
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,519
Because it hurts.

275
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,327
What hurts, João?

276
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,336
Seeing you.

277
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:31,275
Look at me.
I can't take it anymore.

278
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,812
I love you!

279
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:39,576
Explain it. Why?

280
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,313
You loving me
is not logical.

281
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:50,191
Helena... I like things logical.

282
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:54,526
I'm going to kiss you.
All right?

283
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:58,865
You are...
the queen of the school.

284
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:02,574
I'm a poor man with a stammer
and a scholarship.

285
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:03,905
Handsome...

286
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,112
I need you in my life.

287
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,172
I wouldn't last a second
in your life!

288
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:15,944
I know why.
I'm your bestfriend.

289
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:22,116
So you knowhowlonely...

290
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:24,596
I am and howmuch I need you!

291
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,063
What about Ricardo?

292
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:32,664
Lt's over. I'm yours.

293
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:49,483
Look at me. Look at you...

294
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:53,622
I have looked at myself, João.
I sawmyself...

295
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:58,895
ridiculous, futile...
easily impressed.

296
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:03,628
You are beautiful!

297
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:06,964
Beauty is a prison.

298
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:15,544
And, because ofbeauty,
I have seen and done things that

299
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:20,642
even God doesn't know.
And I thought it was important.

300
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:32,754
You... rode in the Stones' airplane.

301
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,234
You knowwhat?

302
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:40,034
Nobody talks about Quantum Physics
in the Stones' airplane.

303
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:44,376
Not even the Stones ride
in their airplane.

304
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,707
Wait.

305
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:50,706
I have never ridden on an airplane.

306
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,045
It's kind oflike this.

307
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:08,867
You shouldn't have done that.

308
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:11,503
- Why not?
- Because I'm going to suffer.

309
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,664
I will never leave your side.

310
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,033
Bitch!

311
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,849
One day, you are going
to change the world.

312
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,383
I need to go.

313
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:40,755
What?

314
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:44,019
The song is over.

315
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:50,130
Where are you going?

316
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:54,930
I'm going to sing. Put this on,
and I'll wait foryou downstairs.

317
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:01,005
You're going to sing?

318
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,847
Yes. To you.

319
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:14,018
I love you.

320
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:46,222
Calm down.

321
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:52,320
I want you to be absolutely calm
and trust me!

322
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:59,394
Why? Why should I trust you?

323
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:01,903
I don't have time
for a subtle approach.

324
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,774
You are smart
and your are going to understand.

325
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:19,419
Who are you?

326
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:26,723
Look at me.
And tell me who I am.

327
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,036
Daddy?

328
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:34,305
You have invented
something extraordinary!

329
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:35,795
I didn't invent anything.

330
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:38,408
In the future.

331
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:43,979
I did? Atime machine?

332
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,753
Yes. Actually,
you wanted to invent...

333
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:50,550
a new energy source, but...

334
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,057
it backfired!

335
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:55,426
This is all really incredible, but...

336
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:57,155
you know,

337
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:59,588
I have to meet Helena.

338
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:03,131
Why don't you come back
anothertime?

339
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:06,004
Because I don't know
howto get back!

340
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:08,063
What do you want from me?

341
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:12,100
To fix... your existence.

342
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,813
The synchronized swim girls!

343
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,178
And nowlet's go to
the second auctioned item!

344
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:30,284
Lt's a beautiful used
Playboy collection!

345
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:36,197
From 82 to the latest edition!

346
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:40,205
Remember that we are raising funds...

347
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:42,833
forthe reform of
the administration's office.

348
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,803
Who is going to bid first?

349
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:50,007
- Is it good have 40 years?
- No!

350
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:53,682
- 100 thousand!
- 100 thousand forthe Lost Soul!

351
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:57,222
- But will I have a happy life?
- No!

352
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:58,723
You don't have a wife,
you don't have kids,

353
00:30:58,723 --> 00:30:59,958
you only have sex
with prostitutes...

354
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:02,560
and spend your entire life
teaching to idiots...

355
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,663
and being scientifically exploited
by a soirêe host!

356
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:08,867
100 thousand and 300 for the Zombie!
Come on, people!

357
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:12,030
- What about Helena?
- Helena is a whore!

358
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:14,639
But we will take care ofthat too.

359
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:16,507
100 thousand and 600!

360
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:19,544
100 thousand and 600
for the toilet paper. Going once!

361
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,535
I don't like you!

362
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:24,574
Maybe I'm stuck here forever!

363
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:26,918
Maybe I'll be sucked
into the future!

364
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:29,020
Or maybe I'll just explode!

365
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,423
In all ofthose scenarios we have
to take this chance...

366
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:35,790
and prevent your life
from being miserable!

367
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:38,159
Going twice!

368
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:39,664
How?

369
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,332
I knowwhen the next war
is going to start,

370
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:43,434
when the Dollar will rise and when
the stock market will crash.

371
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:45,402
And what do I do with that?

372
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:47,833
I thought you were smarter!

373
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:51,476
You are going to make millions
and enjoy your life!

374
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:56,971
Sold to the toilet paper!
Turn it up, DJ!

375
00:31:57,615 --> 00:31:59,845
Damn, the weirdest
thingjust happened!

376
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,753
I sawa guy that looked
just like you,

377
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,255
except his face was a little
deformed, he was older...

378
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:07,349
and was dressed like him!
Is that you, Jorjão?

379
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:09,022
Calm down!

380
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:13,495
I want you to be
absolutely calm...

381
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,633
and trust me.

382
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,102
You are going to have
to tell somebody,

383
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:21,128
oryou are going to go crazy.
You should tell a friend.

384
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:25,473
And that will be the only friend
you will have your entire life.

385
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:28,669
- What are you doing?
- Let's get down to it!

386
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,375
No! No!

387
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:36,083
What the hell is this, man?
What the hell is this?

388
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:40,049
Quiet, people! Quiet! Quiet!

389
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:44,794
I have a very important message
from the infirmary.

390
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:50,223
They are running out of glucose!
Let's go easy on the vodka!

391
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,539
Before we continue...

392
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,508
with our next musical guest...

393
00:32:57,508 --> 00:33:01,946
the Prisoners ofthe Ball!

394
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:07,009
Come on, people!
Turn it up, DJ!

395
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:15,326
Who is the most beautiful girl
ofthe party?

396
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,453
Your mother! Is she here?

397
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:19,697
I have something very important
to tell you. Helena...

398
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:20,732
listen to me!

399
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:23,368
Ricardo, I slapped you
an hour ago.

400
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:24,435
I'm not going to listen to you!

401
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:26,204
I met the owner
of a modeling agency...

402
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:27,772
a Spaniard, friend of my father's.

403
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:30,274
Lfhe likes you,
we will get a lot of money!

404
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:33,402
- We?
- I told him I was your manager!

405
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:39,683
Pathetic!
He believed you?

406
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:41,452
And the most important thing of all!

407
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:45,923
Never, under any circumstance,
travel to New York...

408
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:48,393
on September 11th 2001.

409
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:49,427
Why?

410
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:52,363
Because some crazy guy will crash
two airplanes into the Twin Towers.

411
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:55,433
They will fall. Which will lead to
a second war against Iraq!

412
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:57,135
The oil prices will rise, then fall,
then rise again.

413
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,796
- Are you writing this down?
- Every word.

414
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:03,875
I'm not sure I want to know
what is going to happen.

415
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:07,174
Believe me. You do.

416
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:10,114
I'm going to make you two rich!

417
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:11,416
Let's listen to the man.

418
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:12,750
I mean, listen to yourself, right?

419
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,048
I don't knowifl want
to change the future.

420
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:17,582
I don't want to knowanything.

421
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:20,754
Helena will humiliate you tonight.

422
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:24,158
Helena? What do you mean, she is
going to humiliate you? You are...

423
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,296
Dating.

424
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:30,927
Humiliate me?
How?

425
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:36,207
You will be hung by a string. You will
be covered in feathers and honey.

426
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:37,408
Where is Helena?

427
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:41,208
And you will fly over this crowd,
and they will laugh!

428
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,677
While they chant what is going to be
your name forthe rest of your life.

429
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,713
Ricardo is right.

430
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:53,285
I can't date a nobody...
like you.

431
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,332
Oh, my God.
That must be horrible.

432
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:04,324
Believe me.
There is nothing worse.

433
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,667
She said she loved me.

434
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:13,140
I told you it was suicide
to tutor a monument like that.

435
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:17,442
- Where are you going?
- To finish... your education.

436
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:28,548
Write this down.

437
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:33,158
Women are sincere
in every generation.

438
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:44,131
I found the love of my life!

439
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:46,711
Who are you trying to fool?

440
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:50,511
Give it up for
the Prisoners of the Ball! Get out!

441
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:57,411
Now...
the proofthat there is a God.

442
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:02,456
The queen of all parties: Helena!

443
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:07,062
The Physics sophomore!

444
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:13,636
Later, there is going to be a party
at the administration's office.

445
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:22,146
I'm going to sing this song
to the most amazing man...

446
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:23,909
I have ever met in my life!

447
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,588
Every day when I wake up

448
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:40,164
I lose the time that has passed

449
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:43,895
But I have a lot of time

450
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:50,405
We have all the time in the world

451
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:56,314
Every day before I go to sleep

452
00:36:56,314 --> 00:37:00,774
I remember and forget
about that day

453
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:04,479
Always moving forward

454
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:10,895
We don't have time to lose

455
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:14,854
Our sacred sweat

456
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:21,170
Is more beautiful than
this bitter blood

457
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:25,469
And so serious

458
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:29,647
And wild

459
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,615
This is the siren's song.

460
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:36,853
This is when your life's
disaster begins!

461
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:40,654
João, is she singing
and looking at you?

462
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:42,284
Yes!

463
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:46,692
Bring me that prince!

464
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:54,705
- I don't want to change anything else.
- This is...

465
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,072
when time splits.

466
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:03,581
Look at the sun
on this dark morning

467
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:05,683
You are asking me to give her up?

468
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:07,082
No!

469
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:10,454
The storm comes

470
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:13,224
I'm telling you a way
to be with her.

471
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:19,754
Has the same color as your eyes
Hazel

472
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:24,432
So hold me tight

473
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:35,903
And tell me once again that we are
Far away from everything

474
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:42,077
We have our own time

475
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:45,517
That girl is the reason
foryourfailure!

476
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:49,519
She can be yours now,
because you are in control now.

477
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,595
Remember everything I told you.

478
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:53,998
It's like an equation,
and you knowall the variables.

479
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,989
That's right, champ!

480
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,098
Just one more thing...
The stutter.

481
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,765
What... What stutter?

482
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:03,302
Your speech problem.

483
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:07,141
People who stutter
don't breathe correctly.

484
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:09,937
- Who told you that?
- Helena.

485
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:13,017
She cured you at the stage
15 minutes ago,

486
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,952
in a reality that no longer exists.

487
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:18,786
And we don't want to stutter
forthe rest of our lives, right?

488
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,583
Here's what I want you to do...

489
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:30,023
Disappearing isn't a good way
to start a relationship.

490
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:35,172
Helena, listen!

491
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:36,974
What you sang to me was
the most beautiful thing...

492
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:38,042
I'll ever hear in my entire life.

493
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,101
I'm going to love you forever!

494
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:43,647
You're not...

495
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:46,751
The thing is: Do you love me?

496
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:49,487
I have never felt for anybody
the way I feel for you!

497
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,455
Then why didn't you tell me
you are going to Paris?

498
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:52,615
I'm not going...

499
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:56,859
Ricardo spoke to you.

500
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:02,294
But I knowhe offered you
a life ofluxury, parties and money.

501
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,531
- How can you knowthat?
- How can I knowthat?

502
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:09,131
How... can I knowthat?

503
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:13,002
How can I knowthat?

504
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:15,710
Lt doesn't matter!

505
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,049
I knowthat we will be dancing,

506
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:21,452
a piece of your hair
will cover your face,

507
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:23,721
he will get here, he will be nice
and he will be dressed as an angel.

508
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:25,951
Atoast to the couple
ofthe night!

509
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:31,286
He'll bring two glasses
of spiked champagne.

510
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,756
Why would he do that?

511
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,128
To convince you to do what
you have always wanted it.

512
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:43,739
- And what would that be?
- To humiliate me, to abandon me...

513
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:50,438
to throwme to the wolves and live
your life ofluxury, sex and drugs...

514
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,212
in the international jet set.

515
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,480
You have gone mad!

516
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:59,249
Lt's possible.
But we have to check!

517
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:08,521
Enough, enough, bambino.
Let's go, please...

518
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:12,198
Hey, man!
That's the girl I told about.

519
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:16,335
Now dance. Dance normally.
Normally, normally.

520
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,205
She is very pretty!

521
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:23,013
But she looks completely in love
with that moron.

522
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:24,173
Nonsense!

523
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:35,253
The piece of your hair!
Wow, you look beautiful!

524
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:39,263
I'm not going to waste time and money
with a girl who's in love.

525
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,731
Shejust needs a little push.

526
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:44,133
Alittle push, huh?

527
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:47,597
But be careful.
This is very strong.

528
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:49,633
Do it.

529
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:56,706
That's too much.
I told youjust one drop.

530
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:07,522
Atoast to the couple ofthe night!

531
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:16,267
So that's your prince charming?

532
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:18,269
That's your guardian angel?

533
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:21,204
- João, Ricardo, Ricardo, João.
- Champagne?

534
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:23,374
Not this time, no.

535
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,137
Helena really likes champagne.

536
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:28,579
- She is also going to like GHB.
- GHB?

537
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,047
Lt's a drug that doesn't
exist in Brazil yet,

538
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,607
but it does in Spain.
You put it in it.

539
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,742
- That's ridiculous!
- Drink it!

540
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,254
Lfit'sjust champagne,
I'll be ajealous paranoid.

541
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:39,690
She's going to think that I'm ajerk
and she'll sign the contract...

542
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,792
- with the Spaniard. Right, Helena?
- Right.

543
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:44,261
Helena, did you tell anything
to this imbecile?

544
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:46,063
He is trying to manipulate you,
to throwyou against me.

545
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,325
And he is succeeding!

546
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:50,529
Prove that I'm crazy...

547
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:53,200
and get this over with!

548
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:00,740
I thought you liked champagne.

549
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:06,411
Now... The other one!

550
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,385
The other one!

551
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:12,213
Atta, boy!

552
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,463
Let me showyou something.

553
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,863
Look.

554
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,760
Do you see that guy overthere?

555
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,441
That's the Spaniard!

556
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:34,612
He's the one that can give you
a life ofluxury, parties and money.

557
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:35,646
João!

558
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:39,343
But that means you are never
going to see me again!

559
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,685
What are you talking about?
I would never leave you!

560
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:46,520
You did! You left me.

561
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,425
And I need to tell you...

562
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:50,561
I... I understand, because
I was always a nobody...

563
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:53,689
and you were always...
All of this!

564
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:57,334
- But I never left.
- But I changed!

565
00:43:57,334 --> 00:44:00,030
- But I don't want you to change!
- I changed!

566
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:02,373
Do you want luxury?
Do you want parties?

567
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:04,274
Do you want money?
Do you want wealth?

568
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:06,377
I can give you that, Helena!
Do you knowwhy?

569
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:08,712
Because I'm going to be rich!
I'm going to be very rich!

570
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:11,078
And you will have
anything you want!

571
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:18,319
João, I would love you even
if you didn't have a penny.

572
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:28,989
Wow! You two are beautiful!

573
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:33,399
Life is beautiful!
Life is beautiful!

574
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:51,514
Touchê! Touchê!

575
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:01,420
I'm feeling very unstable.

576
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:03,232
You are emotional, aren't you?

577
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:08,567
No. My molecules are unstable...

578
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:11,474
Does that hurt?

579
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:16,502
Stay close to João. He always
liked you very much.

580
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:19,015
Are you dying?

581
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,185
Probably!

582
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:24,052
I love this woman!
I love you!

583
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:27,191
- I love you!
- Me too!

584
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:31,025
I promise you...
we will be togetherforever!

585
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:33,721
But it will be worth it!

586
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:45,490
Every day when I wake up

587
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:51,435
I lose the time that has passed

588
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:54,996
But I have a lot of time

589
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:01,436
We have all the time in the world

590
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:04,681
Every day before...

591
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:06,410
Helena are you...

592
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:09,712
Another person!

593
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,756
Wow! What's the matter, baby?

594
00:48:12,756 --> 00:48:14,849
You look like youjust
sawan alien!

595
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,565
What are you doing here?

596
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:24,167
Lf you haven't fired me,
I'm here to pay foryour escort!

597
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:27,466
Ric, darling!
Howare you?

598
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,938
- Thanks, honey!
- Thank you!

599
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:36,880
Don't be sad.
Deise will be back...

600
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,405
next week, OK?

601
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:43,914
All right.

602
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:46,851
Put this on fast. We are late.

603
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:48,185
Late?

604
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,224
Wait! I...

605
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:54,831
- Where... are we going, again?
- Very funny!

606
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:57,061
No! Seriously!
Where are we going? I...

607
00:48:57,567 --> 00:49:02,839
I need to talk... to Otávio.

608
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:06,104
Even funnier! The hearing
will start in 30 minutes.

609
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:09,345
Hearing? Of course.

610
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:12,976
Which hearing is it, again? Lt's...

611
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:14,718
I don't know
what the hell you're on,

612
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:17,243
but control yourself
in front ofthejudge.

613
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:21,384
Judge?

614
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:46,539
I'm... another man!
Do you understand?

615
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:52,046
I'm another person...

616
00:49:57,894 --> 00:49:58,918
Panda...

617
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:04,130
The court has decided that
Mr. João Henrique Nogueira

618
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:11,135
is the sole owner ofthe
Man of the Future Investment companies.

619
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,943
I am... the mummy.

620
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:22,352
And mister Otávio Miranda...

621
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:25,879
is forbidden to came
within a 300 feet radio

622
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,054
from his former partner.

623
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:39,333
Whatever this is, we can fix it!

624
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:44,474
You coward!
You bribed thisjudge!

625
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:45,805
- No!
- I'm going to kill you!

626
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:49,146
- I'm going to kill you!
- Panda! Lt's me!

627
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:51,681
- I'm going to kill you!
- Future João! You...

628
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:54,151
Let's get out ofhere
to avoid reporters.

629
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:56,119
He assaulted me, he... he... hit me.

630
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:58,722
He said I bribed thejudge!

631
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,815
Someone in the court
must have leaked that.

632
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:03,420
But how can I be broke?

633
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,422
What about your problems
with the IRS?

634
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:09,933
You got married fourtimes,
you publicly cheated all your wives,

635
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:11,935
you got sued by three ofthem.

636
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:14,037
If that's not enough
to bankrupt someone,

637
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:15,839
add your gambling problem,
race tracks...

638
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,240
- Race tracks?
- International travels...

639
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,575
expansive hookers,

640
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:22,978
high risk investments, megalomaniac
architects, expensive wines.

641
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:25,440
João, you bought a submarine!

642
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:27,617
Wait! Wait!

643
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:29,119
You said I got married fourtimes...

644
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,087
- and that three ofthem sued me.
- That's right!

645
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:34,583
- Who didn't sue me?
- Who? The annoying one.

646
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:36,251
Helena?

647
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,262
João Henrique, you're scarring me!

648
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,524
I married Helena?

649
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:15,292
Helena...

650
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:22,939
I'm not obligated to see visitors!

651
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:24,508
Wait! Wait! Please, wait!

652
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:25,942
I need to talk to you.

653
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:28,745
- I want to go back to my cell!
- Listen, just one minute!

654
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:30,076
One minute.
I'll get you out ofhere.

655
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:35,243
I'll get you out ofhere.
One minute.

656
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:37,883
You have one minute!

657
00:52:40,223 --> 00:52:41,713
One minute...

658
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:48,732
What happened to us?

659
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:51,394
What kind of question is that?

660
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:53,436
How did you ended up here?

661
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:55,961
You know damn well
howl got here!

662
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,075
Asuitcase with four and
a half pounds of cocaine!

663
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:00,810
Cocaine! My God!

664
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,345
Why didn't you tell me?

665
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:05,682
Because you were the one who put
the damn drug in my suitcase!

666
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:08,344
And then you called
the airport police!

667
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:10,520
Why did I do that?

668
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,923
To punish me for something
I didn't do!

669
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:14,550
Because ofjealousy!

670
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:18,223
To stick me in a place
with no men around!

671
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:22,865
I want you to be absolutely calm.

672
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:26,667
And trust me.

673
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:30,197
I am...

674
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:35,204
another person.

675
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:40,479
You are nothing!

676
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,353
You're right.

677
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,257
You're right.

678
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,054
That's what I am.

679
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,326
That's what I've always been...

680
00:54:00,103 --> 00:54:01,695
A zero.

681
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,767
But I will get you out ofhere,
Helena.

682
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:12,639
I will get you out of here
and we will be together forever.

683
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,608
I'll tell you...

684
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,351
There's nothing in this life that
could make me come back to you.

685
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,427
Nothing.

686
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:27,596
Helena...

687
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:50,046
You shouldn't have done
that to me!

688
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,481
Hownice to see you!

689
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:57,627
I needed to find someone smart.

690
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:59,929
I wasn't smart when
I put my project...

691
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:01,665
in the hands
of an idiot like you!

692
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:05,535
Forget that!
Whatever it is, we can fix it.

693
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:08,738
I didn't sell
a particle converter specs...

694
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:11,673
just so it would be
locked up in a safe!

695
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:18,545
You developed a particle converter?

696
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:22,583
Cynic! I created
a new energy source!

697
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:24,988
I'm going to tell the press

698
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:28,591
that you're selling
Brazilian technology...

699
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:31,651
to Americans!
I came here to warn you...

700
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:36,063
I will put my research
on the Internet.

701
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:40,996
I want it built.
From behind bars, if necessary.

702
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,436
Sandra...

703
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,203
Sandra!

704
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:52,405
Particle converter...

705
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:23,974
Look, believe me.

706
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:27,784
You are pointing this gun
at the wrong man.

707
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:31,187
I knowexactly
who I'm pointing this gun at!

708
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:33,178
What did you do to João?

709
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:36,488
I need to kill him too.

710
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:39,753
He disappeared
in a temporal paradox.

711
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:44,067
I was molecularly reorganized
in this reality's body,

712
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,969
but with the conscience
ofthe other one.

713
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:49,564
- Speak in my language!
- I'm in his body.

714
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:53,743
I'm putting a stop
to this madness right now!

715
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,145
No, wait!

716
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:57,814
I curse the day
you walked into my life!

717
00:56:57,814 --> 00:56:59,281
Calm down, calm down...

718
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:03,612
Look, you have a wife,
you have kids.

719
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:08,421
You married the woman
who was supposed to be my wife!

720
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:11,460
I never had kids!

721
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:13,396
I married Carmem?

722
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:15,131
Whatever you did in the past,

723
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:17,333
it can't be worse than
the person you became.

724
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:18,668
Who did I become?

725
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:22,069
The biggestjerk
the world has ever seen!

726
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,264
What about you?

727
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,577
I used to say:

728
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:32,904
"Let's help humanity,
let's save Michael Jackson,

729
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:35,652
let's prevent
the American oil spill.".

730
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:37,086
But you didn't care
about any ofit.

731
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:39,856
You would say: "Money, money!"

732
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:41,687
And I agreed.

733
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:45,728
We are two of nature's anomalies
who deserve to die.

734
00:57:45,728 --> 00:57:47,423
No! Please!

735
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:49,998
I already decided it.
I'll kill you first.

736
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,368
Then I'm going to kill myself.

737
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:54,137
Wait. Please! Please! Wait!

738
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,606
Listen to me, please! Please!

739
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:59,742
Please. I have a plan.

740
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:01,437
I have heard this before.

741
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:05,048
We have money to build
a newaccelerator,

742
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:08,484
- go back and fix things.
- How?

743
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:13,889
By convincing myselfthat
is wrong to change the past.

744
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:46,111
For you.

745
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:48,856
You are sick. You knowthat?

746
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:50,920
Please.

747
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:53,863
Let me at least take you home.

748
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:56,696
- I don't have a home.
- You do now!

749
00:59:07,777 --> 00:59:09,574
You bought this house for me?

750
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:15,379
No. No, actually I... I gave it.

751
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:21,917
Just like the farm in Australia,

752
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,894
the access to my bank account,
my shares in the stock market,

753
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:31,601
the cocoa fields, the apartment at
the Dakota Building in New York,

754
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:34,297
two jets, four helicopters,
twelve cars in the garage,

755
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:36,172
soy fields in Mato Grosso.

756
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:37,340
The Manets, the Monets,
the Matisse,

757
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,841
Picasso, Gauguin, Van Gogh.

758
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:41,332
Acollection of free art.
I don't knowif you like it.

759
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:44,814
Three radio stations, TVstations,

760
00:59:44,814 --> 00:59:47,009
an island in the Pacific.
Anyway, everything.

761
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:49,319
Except the submarine
that I had to sell

762
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:52,311
and the Man ofthe Future Investments
that I'm going to leave to Panda.

763
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:54,724
The IRS is afteryou, isn't it?

764
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:56,157
No.

765
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,629
It is, but...

766
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:01,494
It's not because ofthat.

767
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:03,657
Then, why?

768
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:08,829
I'm still trying to fix things and...

769
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,934
lfit doesn't work,
you will be set for life.

770
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:17,572
I won't like you again
because ofthis.

771
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:19,781
I know.

772
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:23,813
That's why I'm going to do
what I'm going to do.

773
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,924
Howabout it?

774
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:43,106
You knowthat's an astronaut
costume and it doesn't work.

775
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:46,843
- You knowthat, don't you?
- I'm going to a costume party.

776
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:49,835
God! Tell me you are not
going insane.

777
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:52,774
The machine we created left
a micro black hole,

778
01:00:52,882 --> 01:00:54,684
it perforated
the structure of time...

779
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:56,719
and let a link to the past.

780
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:57,720
I know.

781
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,055
The first time I got into
the machine...

782
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:01,090
I was thinking about Helena,
on the day of the costume party.

783
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:03,126
And I ended up exactly there!

784
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:05,026
On the same time
and the same date.

785
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:06,796
And I'm going to do that again.

786
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:08,058
Is that simple?

787
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,667
Apparently feelings
reorganize matter...

788
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,191
as it leaves a black hole.

789
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:15,964
- You must really love this woman!
- Desperately!

790
01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:28,447
Helena... November 22nd, 1991.
The day ofthe party.

791
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:37,559
Helena... November 22nd, 1991.
The day ofthe party.

792
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:42,162
Helena... November 22nd, 1991.
The day ofthe party.

793
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:45,635
Helena... November 22nd, 1991.
The day ofthe party.

794
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:47,830
Helena... November 22nd, 1991.

795
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:13,227
Wow, Inocência, you are awesome!

796
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:16,862
My God! I have goose bumps!

797
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:47,156
Excuse me.
What day is today?

798
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:48,698
- 20...
- 22...

799
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:49,832
November 22... November.

800
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:52,201
- Great! Of what year?
- 1991.

801
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:53,936
- Great! Please, I need...
- Get out!

802
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:56,038
- Unlock it!
- Wait! I need a ride!

803
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:58,438
- Go away! Go away!
- I need a ride!

804
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:41,176
I love you!

805
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:03,027
Too late!

806
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:08,976
Calm down.

807
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,843
I want you to be absolutely calm...

808
01:04:14,116 --> 01:04:15,447
and trust me.

809
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:22,089
Why? Why should I trust you?

810
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:27,494
I don't have time for
a subtle approach.

811
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:30,762
You are smart
and you are going to understand.

812
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:36,137
Who are you?

813
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:41,171
And who is he?

814
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:54,517
Calm down. I want you
to be absolutely calm...

815
01:04:55,591 --> 01:04:57,582
- and trust me.
- What are you?

816
01:04:57,927 --> 01:05:00,196
I'm the effect that
you are causing right now!

817
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:02,221
- What effect?
- Catastrophe.

818
01:05:02,498 --> 01:05:03,897
That bad?

819
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,668
He is going to be arrested
by the IRS,

820
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:08,701
Otávio will kill himself...

821
01:05:09,005 --> 01:05:11,007
and Helena is going tojail.

822
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:12,201
OK.

823
01:05:13,142 --> 01:05:16,579
You tell everything I did wrong
and we will start over.

824
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:19,248
- We don't have to do anything.
- What do you mean?

825
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:22,081
You don't change
what already happened.

826
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:26,155
You cheap moralist!
He has the right to have a chance!

827
01:05:26,155 --> 01:05:27,857
He has to live for himself.

828
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:30,291
You are going to tell me
what I have done wrong!

829
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:48,344
Give it up for
the Prisoners ofthe Ball!

830
01:05:48,344 --> 01:05:50,812
Get out, Carlinhos, now!

831
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:57,119
Now...
the proofthat there is a God.

832
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:00,020
The queen of all parties:

833
01:06:00,189 --> 01:06:03,920
Helena!
The Physics sophomore!

834
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:12,835
I'm going to sing this song...

835
01:06:12,835 --> 01:06:15,963
to the most amazing man
I have ever met in my life!

836
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:43,993
"I had a hallucination
and I passed out.

837
01:06:45,968 --> 01:06:47,837
I must go to the party!

838
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:50,829
Helena is waiting for me!
Signed myself."

839
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:57,380
Our sacred sweat
Is more beautiful than...

840
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,615
Dude, the weirdest thing
just happened!

841
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:02,118
This is the craziest night
of my life!

842
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:05,554
And so serious

843
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:11,752
And wild

844
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:16,225
Wild

845
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:21,033
Wild

846
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:27,137
Bring me that prince!

847
01:07:27,943 --> 01:07:29,712
What? Is she singing to you?

848
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:32,214
She can't be singing to you!
You are a nobody, right?

849
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:33,545
No, am not!

850
01:07:35,284 --> 01:07:36,911
I am a prince!

851
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:46,460
Look at the sun
on this dark morning

852
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:54,327
The storm comes
has the same color as your eyes

853
01:07:56,105 --> 01:08:00,735
Hazel

854
01:08:06,715 --> 01:08:08,512
His name is João!

855
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:14,889
João! João! João!

856
01:08:15,124 --> 01:08:18,787
Breathe, João!
You just have to exhale and sing.

857
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:38,474
So hold me tight

858
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:45,077
And say it one more time
that we are together

859
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:50,016
Away from everything

860
01:08:51,093 --> 01:08:55,860
We have our own time

861
01:08:56,398 --> 01:09:00,960
We have our own time

862
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:05,975
We have our own time

863
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:11,880
I'm not afraid of the dark

864
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:25,521
But leave the lights on
Now

865
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:31,767
What was hidden
is what it got hidden

866
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:36,839
And what was promised
Nobody promised

867
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:40,775
lt was not wasted time

868
01:09:41,477 --> 01:09:46,915
We are so young

869
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:51,878
So young

870
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:56,822
So young

871
01:10:09,972 --> 01:10:11,840
And you wanted to take this
away from him!

872
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:15,435
No! I wanted to avoid
everything that comes next!

873
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:27,452
One more! One more!
One more!

874
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:37,528
One more! One more!
One more!

875
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:51,847
The lovebirds are invited to the party
at the administration's office,

876
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:54,213
where there will be champagne
and a few otherthings.

877
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:56,819
- We can't!
- The Spaniard will be there, Helena.

878
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:58,150
Screwit!

879
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:06,420
One more! One more!
One more!

880
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:11,900
I think that's my gun.

881
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:14,630
You must be my best friend
from the future.

882
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:17,172
Where I come from,
you're not exactly my friend.

883
01:11:17,172 --> 01:11:18,307
How did you get here?

884
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:22,077
I thought it was relatively easy
o press a bottom and, puff!

885
01:11:22,077 --> 01:11:23,704
Jump to wherever
you want to go.

886
01:11:27,316 --> 01:11:29,585
I'm going to give
my Otávio some tips.

887
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:32,721
The problem is that this idiot
doesn't want to change anything else!

888
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:35,781
Oh, you don't want to?
You don't want to? But I do!

889
01:11:38,661 --> 01:11:41,563
- Wait! Wait!
- Will you take me away from here?

890
01:11:41,563 --> 01:11:43,432
Why did you treat him like that?

891
01:11:43,432 --> 01:11:44,990
He wasjust trying
to be nice to us.

892
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:46,935
I want to go some place
alone with you!

893
01:11:46,935 --> 01:11:47,970
Look at me.

894
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:50,339
They are having a big party.

895
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:51,373
Let's dance!

896
01:11:51,373 --> 01:11:53,398
You are acting strange!
Who is this Spaniard?

897
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:56,278
Someone I don't want
to meet, OK?

898
01:11:56,278 --> 01:11:58,380
Let's get out of here and
go someplace else. Just you and I.

899
01:11:58,380 --> 01:11:59,540
Listen to me!

900
01:12:00,849 --> 01:12:03,613
I have never been invited
to a party like that.

901
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:07,885
I have never had a girlfriend.

902
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:11,688
I feel great!

903
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:16,031
I have never been so happy!

904
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:17,828
- João...
- I feel alive!

905
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:20,798
And you are not stammering!

906
01:12:21,637 --> 01:12:25,095
I'm not?
Let's be togetherforever!

907
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:38,912
Let's go! Here!

908
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:41,918
We have some rope.
Come!

909
01:12:42,257 --> 01:12:45,158
You bastard, nowyou are
going to be stuck here.

910
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:56,968
I'm going to find myself, OK?

911
01:12:58,006 --> 01:13:01,543
You have time to do that later.
It's about to happen.

912
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:03,679
We need to let time
take its course.

913
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:05,772
- Coward!
- You're the coward.

914
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:07,149
You have always been.

915
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:10,050
Arrogant, pretentious,
unhappy, coward!

916
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:12,855
This guy is annoying.
You better gag him.

917
01:13:12,855 --> 01:13:14,890
You suffered. He will suffer.

918
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,225
My God! What is
the matter with you?

919
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:19,628
Everybody suffers in life!
Only an unhappy man like you...

920
01:13:19,628 --> 01:13:22,290
can think your suffering
is something special!

921
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:27,729
Sorry. It was too annoying.

922
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:34,506
That's the girl I told about.

923
01:13:39,848 --> 01:13:41,076
Sorry, pirate!

924
01:13:41,316 --> 01:13:42,715
Are you hurt?

925
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:46,219
Nice party...
Come here! Let's dance!

926
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:49,691
That's too much.

927
01:13:49,691 --> 01:13:51,181
I told you just one drop.

928
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:53,491
What a crazy party, Helena!

929
01:13:57,132 --> 01:14:00,329
Atoast to the couple ofthe night!
Come with me.

930
01:14:02,571 --> 01:14:06,108
No! Damn it! They can't drink
from those glasses. Go, go!

931
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:07,336
Let's go!

932
01:14:08,544 --> 01:14:10,375
Man, I wanted to tell you...

933
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:13,282
that you are dealing
with this very maturely.

934
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:16,218
Champagne to the prince charming
and the super lady.

935
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:19,154
We are going to drink this and leave,
because we have otherthings to do.

936
01:14:19,154 --> 01:14:21,657
Atoast to an unforgettable night!

937
01:14:21,657 --> 01:14:23,124
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

938
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:30,332
Excuse me, excuse me.

939
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:32,634
Your costume hasjust been
selected by panel...

940
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:34,203
as the best one ofthe party.

941
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:36,535
He is coming with us
on the stage!

942
01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:38,707
- Give me back my boyfriend!
- No, no, no!

943
01:14:38,707 --> 01:14:41,073
He has to come on stage right now
to receive this award.

944
01:14:41,844 --> 01:14:44,244
Helena, our love has
won an award!

945
01:14:44,379 --> 01:14:45,607
João, let's get out ofhere!

946
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:47,983
Helena, you can't stop living
your life because of this idiot!

947
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:51,316
Don't talk to my girlfriend
like that.

948
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:53,155
Let go of me!

949
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:54,990
You knowwhat she
doesn't understand?

950
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:57,359
Is that when she gets tired
of you tomorrow...

951
01:14:57,359 --> 01:14:59,657
and dump you,
it will be too late.

952
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:02,130
She will have lost
an international carrier...

953
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:03,825
because of a nobody like you!

954
01:15:09,571 --> 01:15:11,095
I've always wanted to do that!

955
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:16,667
You are coming with us!

956
01:15:17,946 --> 01:15:19,880
- What are you doing?
- She has to know!

957
01:15:20,082 --> 01:15:21,850
Last time she didn't know
and it went wrong.

958
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:24,045
We have to include her
this time.

959
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:25,744
Include where? Do what?

960
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:49,941
Hey!

961
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:51,613
Who is there?

962
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:55,276
Look, somebody played
a prank on me.

963
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:58,247
Will you shut up?
Can'tyou see I'm crying?

964
01:16:04,092 --> 01:16:07,528
Weren't you dressed as...

965
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:12,158
João?

966
01:16:17,139 --> 01:16:19,004
- Helena, Helena!
- João?

967
01:16:19,374 --> 01:16:24,539
Helena, these mummies
are extremely fun!

968
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:26,443
Please, untie me!

969
01:16:27,149 --> 01:16:30,516
Lt'sjust that my boyfriend
broke up with me.

970
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:35,457
And I have to go back to the stage
to announce the chickens.

971
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:38,260
It's OK that Antonio Carlos
dumped you.

972
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:41,855
Marco Aurêlio will be
the love of your life!

973
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:49,131
- Marco Aurêlio?
- Yes...

974
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:52,196
Marco Aurêlio!

975
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:59,281
You two are going to be together
next Saturday at the Titãs concert!

976
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:01,613
I don't believe in psychics, OK?

977
01:17:02,084 --> 01:17:04,152
And you must be tied down
for a reason.

978
01:17:04,152 --> 01:17:08,088
So I'm calling the police
so you can tell your story.

979
01:17:09,358 --> 01:17:12,293
We've met at kinder garden,
in misses Olga's class.

980
01:17:12,894 --> 01:17:15,297
I pulled your skirt and
you made me eat dirt...

981
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:17,128
and I got sick for a week.

982
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:19,501
When we got a little older,

983
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:22,937
we started playing spin
the bottle,

984
01:17:24,606 --> 01:17:27,200
but you never wanted to kiss me.

985
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:30,444
Calm down!

986
01:17:31,046 --> 01:17:34,777
I want you to be absolutely calm.

987
01:17:36,118 --> 01:17:38,985
And trust me.
I came from the future.

988
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:42,817
And I can prove it.

989
01:17:43,392 --> 01:17:44,493
How?

990
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:48,020
Here! In my pocket.
You can trust me. Take it!

991
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:50,766
- What's in there?
- Here, take it!

992
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:52,256
What is it?

993
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:58,431
What is this?

994
01:17:58,573 --> 01:18:02,236
Lt's a telephone, a computer,
a personal organizer, a camera...

995
01:18:02,711 --> 01:18:05,614
20 years from nowalmost everybody
will have one ofthese.

996
01:18:05,614 --> 01:18:06,915
It records too?

997
01:18:06,915 --> 01:18:09,315
Press the middle button.

998
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:12,709
It's recording. How cute!

999
01:18:14,556 --> 01:18:18,959
Antonio Carlos,
I want you to rot in hell!

1000
01:18:22,798 --> 01:18:24,993
Why are you telling me
all ofthis?

1001
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:27,662
Because I want you
to let me go.

1002
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:30,205
And because I think
lfigured all out.

1003
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:33,038
Followme.
This is where we are going.

1004
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:37,546
Helena! The mummies' house!

1005
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:40,215
- João!
- It's a colored tunnel!

1006
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:41,512
Don't hurt her, fat boy!

1007
01:18:42,851 --> 01:18:46,753
Mummy friends,
I think I want to go back now.

1008
01:18:56,531 --> 01:18:59,701
- Who are you?
- Your chance to change your life!

1009
01:18:59,701 --> 01:19:02,465
To know everything
that is going to happen!

1010
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:10,435
Careful!

1011
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:15,616
João!

1012
01:19:38,807 --> 01:19:42,038
You are going to pay for this,
you bastard!

1013
01:19:53,822 --> 01:19:55,312
Have I gone insane?

1014
01:19:56,258 --> 01:19:57,520
No, Helena.

1015
01:19:58,193 --> 01:20:01,219
So, forthe love of God,
explain what is happening here!

1016
01:20:02,764 --> 01:20:05,562
I did what you said I would.

1017
01:20:06,735 --> 01:20:08,498
I changed the world.

1018
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:11,003
Helena...

1019
01:20:11,706 --> 01:20:13,264
You idiot!

1020
01:20:14,676 --> 01:20:18,134
I need you to be absolutely calm
and trust me.

1021
01:20:19,781 --> 01:20:21,908
I came from your future!

1022
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:26,783
I'm João 20 years from now.

1023
01:20:32,894 --> 01:20:34,293
What about them?

1024
01:20:34,429 --> 01:20:37,232
He is me before I understood
howwrong all of this is,

1025
01:20:37,232 --> 01:20:40,326
and the other one is a loser
from an alternative future of mine.

1026
01:20:40,635 --> 01:20:42,865
- And I'm not crazy?
- No.

1027
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:46,374
But you are at a quantum paradox.

1028
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:48,643
And how do we stop
a quantum paradox?

1029
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:50,133
You knowthis.

1030
01:20:59,287 --> 01:21:02,313
We studied this together,
remember?

1031
01:21:02,624 --> 01:21:05,525
By cancelling the matrix
ofthe multiplication of variables.

1032
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:07,662
We have to conduct reality...

1033
01:21:07,662 --> 01:21:10,332
back to the time flux
that already happened.

1034
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:12,167
And howdo you plan
on doing that?

1035
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:14,603
Tonight you have to
turn your back on him,

1036
01:21:14,603 --> 01:21:16,504
forget everything
you sawhere.

1037
01:21:16,504 --> 01:21:18,807
I want you to go with Ricardo
and the Spaniard.

1038
01:21:18,807 --> 01:21:21,042
And tomorrowyou are going to be
an international model in Paris.

1039
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:22,677
No! But he is the love of my life.

1040
01:21:22,677 --> 01:21:25,213
If you really love him,
you have to do this.

1041
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:27,579
- Otherwise it's going to be the end.
- No!

1042
01:21:28,516 --> 01:21:30,218
Lt's the beginning
of our lives together.

1043
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:32,948
It's the end!
Believe me, it's the end.

1044
01:21:42,497 --> 01:21:45,660
I have invented the end
oftimes machine.

1045
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:51,231
I invented it, jerky!

1046
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:55,440
Humanity will go back to the past
eternally to make the future better.

1047
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:58,444
Corporations, governments,
evil geniuses...

1048
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:00,282
They will go back to increase
the profit margin,

1049
01:22:00,282 --> 01:22:02,807
to win an election,
to dominate the world.

1050
01:22:04,019 --> 01:22:06,510
There will never be a future again.

1051
01:22:17,299 --> 01:22:18,533
So that's it?

1052
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:20,969
In order to save the world I have
to stay away from the man I love?

1053
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:24,996
You have to promise me you are not
going to look for him until 2011.

1054
01:22:25,307 --> 01:22:27,741
If you truly love him,

1055
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:30,946
maybe we will still meet
in this lifetime.

1056
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:32,538
I will tell you...

1057
01:22:33,581 --> 01:22:37,608
I love you today as much
as I loved you tonight.

1058
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:43,254
- And I can't see you?
- I have always been like this.

1059
01:22:44,392 --> 01:22:45,859
I get it.

1060
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:50,398
I have always come back
and made you betray me,

1061
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:52,832
so we would be apart
from each other.

1062
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:58,206
The machine created a moment
where the future and the pass blend.

1063
01:22:58,206 --> 01:23:01,141
They need each other
in orderto happen.

1064
01:23:04,846 --> 01:23:08,907
No... No! I can't!

1065
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:10,551
Helena, look around.

1066
01:23:11,886 --> 01:23:14,081
There's three of me in this place!

1067
01:23:16,224 --> 01:23:18,293
This is terribly wrong.
This is biggerthan everything.

1068
01:23:18,293 --> 01:23:20,829
It's biggerthan me and
it's bigger than you.

1069
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:22,464
You can't do that to me.

1070
01:23:22,464 --> 01:23:25,763
You need to do that to me.
Both of us...

1071
01:23:28,236 --> 01:23:30,466
together...

1072
01:23:30,638 --> 01:23:32,196
for love.

1073
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:58,556
Hey!

1074
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,395
You two!

1075
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,701
What's going on there?

1076
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:32,560
You are going to be a wonderful man.

1077
01:24:38,206 --> 01:24:40,003
And you...

1078
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:43,510
You are the kind of man
that is worth waiting for.

1079
01:25:10,705 --> 01:25:12,172
What is this?

1080
01:25:14,976 --> 01:25:16,544
That's his newname.

1081
01:25:16,544 --> 01:25:20,348
Zero? What do you want me
to do with this?

1082
01:25:20,348 --> 01:25:23,840
I want you to hang it on his neck
in front of everybody.

1083
01:25:24,152 --> 01:25:28,145
Tell Ricardo to call the zombies
that he hired for security.

1084
01:25:28,323 --> 01:25:30,757
Tell him he was right,
that I'm an idiot

1085
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:34,095
and that you want João to be
the night's chicken.

1086
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:38,032
Go, Helena!

1087
01:25:38,032 --> 01:25:40,101
How can you be
so cruel to yourself?

1088
01:25:40,101 --> 01:25:44,367
Because this happened!
And it needs to happen again.

1089
01:25:45,773 --> 01:25:48,298
- What about you?
- I don't know.

1090
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:53,603
- Will I see you again?
- It's not very likely mathematically.

1091
01:25:59,554 --> 01:26:03,057
Then, João, you are going
to have to prove...

1092
01:26:03,057 --> 01:26:05,890
that love is part ofthe general
equation ofthe universe.

1093
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:20,573
Get out ofhere!

1094
01:26:22,477 --> 01:26:23,745
Go!

1095
01:26:23,745 --> 01:26:29,206
Hey, astronaut, you need
to stop kissing my girlfriend.

1096
01:26:29,884 --> 01:26:34,184
Helena is gone.
Nowyou need to go too.

1097
01:26:40,228 --> 01:26:42,730
I'm crazy, really crazy!

1098
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:46,601
Listen... It's going to be
very hard.

1099
01:26:46,601 --> 01:26:50,002
Look, astronaut, I'm Chinese.

1100
01:26:51,806 --> 01:26:54,342
But you will get through this. OK?

1101
01:26:54,342 --> 01:26:57,641
Astronaut, you are behaving
like an old aunt.

1102
01:26:57,812 --> 01:27:01,543
You are like my father.

1103
01:27:03,518 --> 01:27:05,543
Because he was right.

1104
01:27:07,922 --> 01:27:10,686
Life is about dealing with problems.

1105
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:16,254
There is no life without problems.

1106
01:27:17,298 --> 01:27:20,290
- You are cool!
- You too!

1107
01:27:21,970 --> 01:27:24,200
Lt was nice meeting you.

1108
01:27:25,807 --> 01:27:27,934
It changed my life!

1109
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:44,618
Who are you?

1110
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:48,824
A dream that you will forget.

1111
01:28:06,981 --> 01:28:10,144
Antonio Carlos,
you can be with your bitch!

1112
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:16,386
Marco Aurêlio, I'll see you Saturday
at the Titãs concert.

1113
01:28:27,101 --> 01:28:28,329
What's up?

1114
01:28:29,604 --> 01:28:30,805
Hello, friends!

1115
01:28:30,805 --> 01:28:33,535
Ready to fly?
Get him!

1116
01:28:34,776 --> 01:28:38,507
- Give it up for Clêber!
- Wonderful! Wonderful!

1117
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:42,211
- Hey, let go of me!
- Get this woman out ofhere.

1118
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:43,477
Let me go!

1119
01:28:43,618 --> 01:28:47,076
And now, here is
tonight's little bird!

1120
01:28:49,924 --> 01:28:52,017
Put your hands
together for him!

1121
01:28:56,798 --> 01:28:58,993
Smearthis idiot with honey!

1122
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:46,680
I told you that
you would end up getting hurt!

1123
01:29:59,594 --> 01:30:03,462
Helena! Helena!

1124
01:30:03,664 --> 01:30:04,995
I'm here!

1125
01:30:10,104 --> 01:30:11,696
Helena...

1126
01:30:13,207 --> 01:30:16,768
Why are they doing this to me?

1127
01:30:18,279 --> 01:30:20,144
Because I told them to.

1128
01:30:20,648 --> 01:30:22,639
But you love me!

1129
01:30:25,052 --> 01:30:29,352
Ricardo was right.
I could never love a zero like you.

1130
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:00,482
Do you want to fly, chicken?

1131
01:31:02,557 --> 01:31:05,460
João! Get out! Get out!

1132
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:08,554
Get out ofthe way!
João! Let go of me!

1133
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:17,733
Lt's too late to try to help.

1134
01:31:22,777 --> 01:31:24,677
Sandra, help me!

1135
01:31:24,779 --> 01:31:27,213
Let him go! Can't you
see he is not alright?

1136
01:31:27,381 --> 01:31:29,849
- He has never been better.
- Take it away!

1137
01:31:31,619 --> 01:31:33,348
Lt's happening!

1138
01:31:34,689 --> 01:31:36,357
- Here is...
- João!

1139
01:31:36,357 --> 01:31:40,020
The return of Helena's
newlast boyfriend!

1140
01:31:40,394 --> 01:31:42,021
Helena!

1141
01:31:43,364 --> 01:31:44,854
And your boyfriend?

1142
01:31:47,134 --> 01:31:49,762
I set up a date 20 years
from now.

1143
01:31:51,172 --> 01:31:55,108
The future of Otávio,
the investor, is no longer possible.

1144
01:32:02,750 --> 01:32:05,583
Fly, little birdie!

1145
01:32:07,121 --> 01:32:08,679
Helena!

1146
01:32:09,891 --> 01:32:12,660
He is a zero! I said zero!

1147
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:15,254
What the hell
are you doing, Ricardo?

1148
01:32:17,031 --> 01:32:18,498
Zero!

1149
01:32:20,768 --> 01:32:25,000
Zero! Zero! Zero!

1150
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:27,498
Lt happened what...

1151
01:32:31,812 --> 01:32:33,973
it was supposed to happen.

1152
01:33:05,713 --> 01:33:08,443
Zero. Help me, man!

1153
01:33:29,337 --> 01:33:31,305
Are you dressed as an astronaut?

1154
01:33:31,539 --> 01:33:33,632
I went to a costume party, Panda.

1155
01:33:34,075 --> 01:33:35,565
You didn't go anywhere!

1156
01:33:35,676 --> 01:33:39,635
An energy pulse of unknown
source went through you.

1157
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:40,974
That's right.

1158
01:33:41,415 --> 01:33:44,441
You were right!
We created fire!

1159
01:33:44,552 --> 01:33:48,318
We are gods! We are rich!

1160
01:33:51,659 --> 01:33:52,819
What is this?

1161
01:33:53,628 --> 01:33:58,531
Waming! All files will be deleted.

1162
01:33:59,367 --> 01:34:01,636
What are you doing?

1163
01:34:01,636 --> 01:34:05,970
I'm making sure no one will ever
turn this machine on.

1164
01:34:06,474 --> 01:34:08,876
You can't do that!
You can't do that!

1165
01:34:08,876 --> 01:34:11,379
You can't do that!
Sushi, fix this!

1166
01:34:11,379 --> 01:34:12,780
I'm trying! I'm trying!

1167
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:14,338
Panda, listen to me.

1168
01:34:14,582 --> 01:34:17,779
- It's the work of a lifetime, Zero.
- I travelled through time.

1169
01:34:18,552 --> 01:34:20,315
My God...

1170
01:34:21,856 --> 01:34:23,591
Twice.

1171
01:34:23,591 --> 01:34:26,822
So you are... completely crazy!

1172
01:34:29,630 --> 01:34:30,798
Lt records too?

1173
01:34:30,798 --> 01:34:32,698
Press the middle button.

1174
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:35,095
It's recording. How cute!

1175
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:41,532
Antonio Carlos,
I wantyou to rot in hell!

1176
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:43,811
Why are you telling me
all of this?

1177
01:34:43,811 --> 01:34:45,870
Because I think I figured all out.

1178
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:50,712
Waming!
All files have been deleted.

1179
01:34:54,722 --> 01:34:56,485
Do you have the car keys?

1180
01:34:59,326 --> 01:35:00,795
@HelenaH
Message to the astronaut:

1181
01:35:00,795 --> 01:35:03,059
I always thought
you'd come back today.

1182
01:35:03,731 --> 01:35:06,393
@HelenaH nowboarding
the plane to Rome.

1183
01:35:06,867 --> 01:35:09,859
@HelenaH I will be waiting
for you forever.

1184
01:35:15,242 --> 01:35:18,212
Why didn't you get in?
Stop being stupid and get in.

1185
01:35:18,212 --> 01:35:19,440
No, wait!

1186
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:25,811
- What's the damn problem?
- Time is the problem, Ricardo!

1187
01:35:35,196 --> 01:35:36,493
João!

1188
01:35:37,098 --> 01:35:38,565
Zero.

1189
01:35:39,333 --> 01:35:40,698
Excuse me, excuse me, sir.

1190
01:35:41,035 --> 01:35:44,334
- You can call me Zero.
- Hi, Zero.

1191
01:35:45,039 --> 01:35:46,540
Howwas your life?

1192
01:35:46,540 --> 01:35:49,977
Fun, a little crazy, lonely.
What about yours?

1193
01:35:49,977 --> 01:35:51,512
Lt is going to be what
I make of it now.

1194
01:35:51,512 --> 01:35:53,412
I'll never leave your side.

1195
01:35:54,849 --> 01:35:56,908
So kiss me because
I'm going to be arrested.

1196
01:35:59,887 --> 01:36:01,956
Sir, please, come with us!

1197
01:36:01,956 --> 01:36:03,924
- We will miss this flight.
- Sir!

1198
01:36:04,992 --> 01:36:07,256
- I love you!
- I love you too!

1199
01:36:08,095 --> 01:36:09,460
Ricardo!

1200
01:36:10,264 --> 01:36:11,959
You are fired.

1201
01:36:21,308 --> 01:36:24,277
ONE YEAR LATER

1202
01:36:24,612 --> 01:36:28,249
So, I hereby declare that
mister João Henrique Nogueira

1203
01:36:28,249 --> 01:36:32,310
is found not guilty of destroying
scientific research.

1204
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:47,067
You did what you had to do.

1205
01:36:47,067 --> 01:36:50,525
Yes. You hid the humanity's
biggest invention.

1206
01:36:50,771 --> 01:36:53,641
Sooner or later someone will invent
that thing again.

1207
01:36:53,641 --> 01:36:54,809
Yes, but we hope...

1208
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:57,573
they come to the same
conclusion as we did.

1209
01:36:58,979 --> 01:37:00,714
And you are a free man.

1210
01:37:00,714 --> 01:37:04,919
Free, unemployed, expelled
from the scientific community,

1211
01:37:04,919 --> 01:37:06,682
laughing stock on the Internet.

1212
01:37:06,921 --> 01:37:08,589
For someone who was going
to change the future,

1213
01:37:08,589 --> 01:37:10,887
you have a guaranteed
place in heaven.

1214
01:37:11,525 --> 01:37:13,288
Maybe not.

1215
01:37:19,533 --> 01:37:21,501
Surprise!

1216
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:27,368
I think I figured it out!

1217
01:37:28,042 --> 01:37:30,578
- Figured what out?
- What you have always known.

1218
01:37:30,578 --> 01:37:33,113
You set up a technology fund
to help me!

1219
01:37:33,113 --> 01:37:35,274
That doesn't make sense.

1220
01:37:36,250 --> 01:37:38,552
Unless you knew...

1221
01:37:38,552 --> 01:37:42,056
that one day I would go
to the past and find you.

1222
01:37:42,056 --> 01:37:43,524
You are a genius!

1223
01:37:43,524 --> 01:37:46,891
I believe that more
than yourself!

1224
01:37:47,294 --> 01:37:50,497
That doesn't make any sense!
I don't have money.

1225
01:37:50,497 --> 01:37:51,799
But you will have!

1226
01:37:51,799 --> 01:37:54,168
You made money at the stock
market. You got rich!

1227
01:37:54,168 --> 01:37:56,503
You will make millions
with Google shares!

1228
01:37:56,503 --> 01:37:59,495
Google?
Is that a chewing gum?

1229
01:38:00,207 --> 01:38:01,475
Lt's a search engine.

1230
01:38:01,475 --> 01:38:03,477
What am I going to do
with Google shares?

1231
01:38:03,477 --> 01:38:06,742
You will sell them, one day
before the mortgage recession.

1232
01:38:06,914 --> 01:38:10,111
You will make a lot of money,
you will buy this university

1233
01:38:10,451 --> 01:38:12,953
and you will help João
when he needs you the most.

1234
01:38:12,953 --> 01:38:14,421
Howmany scientists in the world...

1235
01:38:14,421 --> 01:38:17,057
are using a particle accelerator
in a project?

1236
01:38:17,057 --> 01:38:18,615
One... you!

1237
01:38:20,561 --> 01:38:22,153
Untie me.

1238
01:38:25,432 --> 01:38:27,024
Please.

1239
01:38:34,108 --> 01:38:37,475
Tell me only ifl come back.

1240
01:38:38,913 --> 01:38:41,074
You came back, didn't you?

1241
01:38:42,449 --> 01:38:45,009
Wait, wait!
Are you saying that I'm rich?

1242
01:38:45,552 --> 01:38:48,612
Panda, you are filthy rich!

1243
01:38:50,224 --> 01:38:52,283
Oh! Fabulous!

1244
01:39:01,368 --> 01:39:03,393
You cheated it!

1245
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:07,439
I deserved it!

1246
01:39:07,508 --> 01:39:11,137
So hold me tight

1247
01:39:13,180 --> 01:39:17,879
And tell me once again
That we are

1248
01:39:18,252 --> 01:39:22,450
Far away from everything

1249
01:39:23,924 --> 01:39:28,691
We have our own time

1250
01:39:29,096 --> 01:39:33,499
We have our own time

1251
01:39:34,268 --> 01:39:38,568
We have our own time

1252
01:39:38,806 --> 01:39:44,369
I'm not afraid of the dark

1253
01:39:45,179 --> 01:39:58,115
But leave the lights on
Now

1254
01:39:59,259 --> 01:40:04,498
What was hidden
Is what it got hidden

1255
01:40:04,498 --> 01:40:09,603
And what was promised
Nobody promised

1256
01:40:09,603 --> 01:40:13,664
lt was not wasted time

1257
01:40:14,141 --> 01:40:19,306
We are so young

1258
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:24,414
So young

1259
01:40:25,219 --> 01:40:29,121
So young
