1
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,800
- Oh, it's lovely.
- Yes, it is. It certainly is.

2
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,600
Thank you.

3
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,400
All right, everybody. That's it for today.

4
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,600
Be sure you get that drop cloth up
before you leave, all right?

5
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,800
I like the sound of that! Yes, sir!

6
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,800
I broke this down
and I'm gonna leave it like that.

7
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,800
You make sure you get to heaven.

8
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,800
- That's some nice work, young blood.
- Thank you, Mr Rodette.

9
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
Yeah, your daddy taught you right.

10
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,800
When all the construction comes back, you got
skills to make something of yourself.

11
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,600
Thank you, sir.

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,200
That's fine. I can wait till payday.

13
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm sorry.
All the others have families to feed.

14
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,800
But you do good work.

15
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,400
- I like what you do, OK?
- OK.

16
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,000
You got a funny way of telling me that.

17
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,800
Morning.

18
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,800
- Didn't I tell you I could pull some strings?
- Yes, you did.

19
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,600
Thank you. You're a good man.

20
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,400
- But tell me why...
- Morning.

21
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,400
Why would a doctor
want to hire a carpenter?

22
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,800
Because it ain't nothing
but scud work anyway.

23
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,200
You ain't gonna like it.

24
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,600
- You say the pay was $12 a week?
- Yeah.

25
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,800
- I'm liking it already.
- All right, then.

26
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,000
Dr Blalock, this is Vivien Thomas.

27
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,400
Vivien? That's a girl's name.

28
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,600
Yes, my mother was so sure
she was having a girl

29
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,800
that she picked the name early, and kept it.

30
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You don't say.

31
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,200
- I'm pleased to meet you, sir.
- Call me Doctor.

32
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:47,600
And tell this good doctor that his theories are
interesting and I'll pray for him.

33
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,600
- Yes, Doctor.
- Though it's his patients I should pray for.

34
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Keep up, son.

35
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,400
- This is where my work is done.
- What is your work?

36
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,000
Medical research.

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
We push the limits of surgery

38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,600
using stray dogs
we get from the local dog catch.

39
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,400
They're darling but don't get too attached.

40
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,400
They're a means to a great end.

41
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,800
The dog pens get cleaned out twice a day.

42
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
I need the lab swept every morning.

43
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,000
Simple tasks, but they proved
beyond the abilities of your predecessors.

44
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,800
Can you handle it?

45
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,400
- So?
- So what?

46
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,000
Don't "so what" me. Did you get it?

47
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,200
You got it. You must have got it.

48
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,600
- It's working at a hospital?
- Yeah.

49
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,600
I'm so glad.
Everyone's gonna see how smart you are.

50
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,800
I don't know
how smart you have to be to shovel up.

51
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,800
The guy I'm working for, he seemed
kind of eccentric, but he is a doctor, yeah.

52
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,600
That's right, he is a doctor.
So you just keep your eyes open.

53
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,600
- We can get married now.
- Yeah.

54
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,400
Do everything just like we laid it out.

55
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,000
Doctor...

56
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and Mrs Thomas.

57
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,600
- Vivien.
- Good morning, sir.

58
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,800
- You said you were a carpenter?
- Yes.

59
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,200
- Did you go to high school?
- Yes, I did. Got my diploma.

60
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,600
Planning on going
to Tennessee State next year

61
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,600
to study medicine, be a doctor.

62
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,400
Unusual ambition for a carpenter.

63
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,000
I always wanted to be one since I was a kid.

64
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:50,000
I almost saved up enough money
for college and then the slowdown hit.

65
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,200
Those are Van Slyke-Neill gas manometers
over there. You can handle a saw?

66
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,000
- Yeah, since I was 12.
- Do tell.

67
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,400
For cutting the lines, my father
would measure on the lumber.

68
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,400
Call me Doctor.
So your daddy's a carpenter, too?

69
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,600
- What does he think of your ambition?
- He knows I had my mind set on it.

70
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,000
Those apparatus on the workbench.
What are they called?

71
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,400
Van Slyke-Neill gas manometers, sir, Doctor.

72
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
They are, indeed.

73
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,400
The Vanderbilt may be
a podunk institution,

74
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,600
but I'm gonna put it on the medical map.

75
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm working on traumatic shock.

76
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,800
Damn thing kills thousands of people
every year,

77
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,400
and doctors don't know
what the hell to do about it.

78
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,600
Let me see those hands.

79
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Pick that up.

80
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,600
Now the left hand.

81
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
Good.

82
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,800
Excuse me, Vivien.
Dr Blalock wanted you to have this.

83
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
- Thank you.
- Good night.

84
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,400
You know what my grandfather did?

85
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,200
It has nothing to do
with me going out on strike.

86
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,800
Do you know what my grandfather did?

87
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,600
Yes.

88
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,000
He picked cotton in Mississippi.
You told me a hundred times.

89
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,600
My grandfather was a piece of property.

90
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,200
No better than that chair or table
over there.

91
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,400
His son became a free man
at the age of 15.

92
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,000
He raised me with hardly an elementary school
education.

93
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,200
Now I see my son graduate college
and go on to teach school.

94
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,600
So don't tell me
things don't get better over time.

95
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,400
Things don't just get better. People got
to change things, Pop. Make them better.

96
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,800
If I don't do something, I'll be a dead man
before I get paid like white teachers do.

97
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,000
Vivien, you know I'm right about this.

98
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,200
All right, now, Harold, just hold your head.
I got reading to do.

99
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,000
To anaesthetise Brutus,
first we have to calculate the weight.

100
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,800
He weighs 18.4 kilograms.

101
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:33,000
And it should take
552 milligrams of sodium barbital...

102
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,800
to anaesthetise him for three hours
if the absorption rate is uniform.

103
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,400
Dogs? What kind of doctor is he?

104
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,800
When you practise on dogs,
then you can help heal people.

105
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,600
- Gives me the willies.
- It's not that bad.

106
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:56,400
You look inside, you see all the colours,
all the pinks and blues, reds.

107
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,600
It's beautiful, Clara.
That's where life comes from.

108
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,800
What's this?

109
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,400
Open up.

110
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:10,200
- Excuse me, sir. What's going on here?
- The bank is closed.

111
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,400
- Closed?
- Yup.

112
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,200
Open up.

113
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,800
- Open this door!
- Somebody got to see somebody in there.

114
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,800
Open up, it's 10:00. I got to get to work.

115
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,200
Let's go. We'll come back later.

116
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,000
No. Something's wrong. It can't be closed.

117
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,800
Excuse me.

118
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,000
Excuse me, sir. Hello.

119
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,600
- Get away from that window. We're closed.
- But I have my money in there.

120
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,000
- I need to get my money out.
- I can't get your money back for you.

121
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,600
- Why not? Tell me why not.
- Go on home, son. The bank has failed.

122
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,000
Sir, that's all my savings!

123
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,600
I had my money for school in there.
They got my money in there.

124
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,400
- Sir, that's my money for college.
- Your money's gone.

125
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,000
Gone?

126
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,400
- But what are they talking about?
- They talking about, it's gone, Ma.

127
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,600
We'll all just have to start over.

128
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,400
- Can't fight it now, it's done.
- It just feels so wrong.

129
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,600
Took me seven years to save that money.

130
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,200
You're not the only one
who had money in that bank.

131
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,000
It's done! It's over with!

132
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,600
- We still got each other, Viv.
- Yeah, we got each other.

133
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,000
That's all poor people ever have
is each other.

134
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,000
There's no cut down the cannula, the femoral
vein. I showed you how to do it.

135
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,800
I figured out a way
to give it barbital intravenously.

136
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,000
- Where you putting it?
- In the forepaw.

137
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,800
The manometer?

138
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,800
It's all set up, Doctor.

139
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,400
Good.

140
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,000
- You can begin the incision.
- I'm not ready for that.

141
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,200
If I say you're ready, you're ready.

142
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,400
I'll mark out the line and you cut along it.

143
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,800
Just like you did for your old daddy.

144
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,800
- Like this?
- Just like that. Keep your hand taut.

145
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Why are we making the incision here?

146
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,200
- To gain access to the pulmonary artery.
- And how will we find it, Vivien?

147
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,200
It's the artery leading to the lungs
from the right side of the heart.

148
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,200
Not bad.

149
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,000
Now the rib spreader.

150
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,000
And why are we gonna damage
poor Brutus' greater vessels?

151
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,800
To induce traumatic shock to study it.

152
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,800
Watch this manometer.

153
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,200
And imagine that Brutus
is a 16-year-old boy,

154
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,800
just fell out of a tree saving his mum's cat.

155
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,800
He's broken four ribs, he's concussed.

156
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,600
Dad's rushed him to ER.

157
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,800
But he's gone into shock.
His blood pressure's way down.

158
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,200
His vital signs almost nonexistent.

159
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Can we save him?

160
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,000
Not if I use present methods of treatment.

161
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,200
Conventional wisdom says
I should constrict the vessels.

162
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,600
I beg to differ. Let's break their rules.
Use my rules.

163
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Body needs blood.

164
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,400
Let's give it some.

165
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,400
How's that gauge?

166
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,800
It's still falling.

167
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,200
Maybe the experts are right.
Maybe I'm wrong.

168
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,600
Maybe I'll kill this boy
and break his mother's heart.

169
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,400
It's rising.

170
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,000
That's life coming back.

171
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,200
- How's that make you feel?
- Good.

172
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,000
Very good, Doctor.

173
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,800
Let's look at the record of our work.

174
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,400
- Where's the smoked drums?
- I'm sorry?

175
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,000
The smoked drums.

176
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,800
- You didn't set the smoked drums?
- What is a smoked drum?

177
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,400
That's a smoked drum.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

178
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,800
I record all the information I need
on a smoked drum.

179
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,600
- I did not know that.
- Is nobody listening to me?

180
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,200
God damn it!

181
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,600
I have to do everything myself.

182
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,600
A whole day's work goes down the toilet,
and I have to start all over again.

183
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,200
Do you have sawdust
or just plain shit for brains?

184
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Fine, get out of here.

185
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,600
Oh, Jesus.

186
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,600
- Hold on a minute, will you?
- I was not raised to take that type of talk.

187
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,800
My apologies. I'm sorry I lost my temper.

188
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,600
Normally it takes assistants months
to learn what you picked up in days.

189
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,200
It won't happen again.

190
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Please.

191
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,600
Ladies and gentlemen.
Fellas, take the music down, will you?

192
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,400
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.

193
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,800
I mentioned to General Cunningham

194
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:22,000
how proud we were that Al had chosen us
over all the medical schools in the country.

195
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,600
John, why don't you tell us what you said?

196
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,000
Be glad to, Walter.

197
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I just got back from a month at the front.

198
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,600
There are thousands of our boys
in field hospitals

199
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,000
all over North Africa and ltaly

200
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,800
who owe their lives to Dr Blalock's work
in the treatment of shock.

201
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,400
I want everyone here to know
how grateful we are to him

202
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,600
and how proud you all should be.

203
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,800
Hear, hear.

204
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,400
- Dr Blalock, welcome.
- Thank you.

205
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,200
Thanks, General.
It's great to have you here, Al.

206
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,800
But truth be told, it's Mary we really want.

207
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,600
Our new Chairman
of the Department of Surgery,

208
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,200
my old and dear friend, Dr Alfred Blalock.

209
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
Thank you, Walter.

210
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,600
Mary and I welcome you all to our home.

211
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,600
As do our dear children.

212
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,000
- Sadie, get them to bed, now.
- No!

213
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,000
Thank you, Johns Hopkins,
for my prodigal return

214
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,200
after 15 years in the Tennessee backwoods.

215
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
To find myself back here...

216
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,400
Dreams do come true.

217
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:51,000
You're the best surgeons in the country
and I'm honoured to lead you.

218
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,600
To use a timely reference -

219
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,800
"We'll storm the beaches together.
Shoulder to shoulder."

220
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,000
Lay siege to the mysteries of medicine.

221
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,800
We'll make the kind of progress
Hopkins used to be known for.

222
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,400
I know we will accomplish
great things together.

223
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,600
I'm looking
for my next watershed discovery,

224
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,000
not to put too modest a point on it.

225
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,600
It's not enough for us to be great surgeons.

226
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,600
We need to be outstanding researchers.
Any ideas? Anything innovative?

227
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,600
Skin grafts?
Testing what skin groups might take?

228
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,000
- Isn't skin merely packaging?
- No, it keeps out infection.

229
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,200
Excuse me, may I suggest something?

230
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,200
Please do. I'm very suggestible.
Tell us your name again.

231
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,600
- I run the Harriet Lane Clinic for children.
- Dr Taussig. Yes, of course.

232
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,000
Dr Longmire, Dr Kelven, Dr Cooley.

233
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,600
- I've read about your research.
- On congenitally malformed hearts.

234
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,600
Oh, boy. Women and their hearts.

235
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,600
Vivien, would you get Dr Taussig a drink?

236
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,600
- What would you like?
- Champagne would be lovely.

237
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,800
Let's lubricate the vein of inspiration.

238
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,800
Go on, Dr Taussig, tell us more.

239
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,400
It's something that up to now
has been written off as untreatable.

240
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,600
But I don't believe it has to be.
I'm speaking of Tetralogy of Fallot.

241
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,200
- Blue babies.
- Yes, these children's hearts aren't failing.

242
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,000
They're suffocating due to a blockage
in the main artery to the lung.

243
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,200
Pulmonary stenosis.

244
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,600
The mortality rate is 100%.

245
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,400
I've watched
hundreds of cyanotic children die.

246
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,000
I admitted a baby tonight
who will certainly die

247
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,600
because no one has had the courage
to attempt a surgical solution to this.

248
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,600
- Maybe with good reason.
- To put it mildly.

249
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,800
You can't operate on the heart.

250
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,600
- We don't have proof of that.
- My point exactly.

251
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,600
- It's possible for us...
- You have to stop the heart

252
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,400
to perform a correction
within three minutes.

253
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,800
By that time, they're dead.

254
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,600
There must be a way
to get more blood to the lungs.

255
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,400
I mean, I doubt we could
repair a defect in the heart walls...

256
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,400
Without causing ventricular fibrillation.

257
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,800
There may be a way to avoid
interfering with the circulation...

258
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,800
If we focus on the pulmonary artery.

259
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,000
Who on this God's earth are you?

260
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,400
- Brought home some food from the party.
- I'm trying to get her down. Hold on.

261
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,000
OK, girl. Now go to sleep, baby.

262
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,400
The girls are just getting to bed?

263
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,600
Two-ton neighbour upstairs
nearly burst through the boards.

264
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,800
- I'm gonna have to fix that.
- Are you gonna fix the fat man?

265
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,600
Get him to stop hollering his head off
when the girls is trying to sleep?

266
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,800
Try a devilled egg. They're real good.

267
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,800
Seen better in Nashville.

268
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,400
- I want to go home, Viv.
- Clara, it's our first week.

269
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,600
Yeah, and you said
if we didn't like it, remember?

270
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,600
- Yes.
- Our family's in Nashville.

271
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:48,400
We had a home in a good neighbourhood.
The schools were fine. Not living in this...

272
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,800
I don't know how we're gonna make it
on that pay cheque

273
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,600
and he got you serving drinks at his party
just to make ends meet. Come on.

274
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,600
Try to understand.
When I started at Vanderbilt I was a janitor.

275
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,000
Dr Blalock saw what I could contribute,
and he gave me a chance.

276
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,800
When they offered him the job in Detroit,

277
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,600
he didn't take it
because they didn't take me.

278
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,800
Now I'm a lab assistant to a top surgeon

279
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,800
at the number one medical school
in the country.

280
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,800
- It's a good position.
- What about you going to school?

281
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,600
You don't have to remind me of that.
We have a family now.

282
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
Sweetheart, it's important work.

283
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:36,400
And it's a real opportunity
and I love what I'm doing.

284
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,200
So it doesn't really matter
how I feel, then, does it?

285
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,200
Clara, you know it matters.

286
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,000
See that man?

287
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,600
That's Johns Hopkins himself.

288
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,600
Sir William Osler,
the father of modern American medicine.

289
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,000
William Halstead, invented the mastectomy.

290
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,400
Let me show you some of the others.

291
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,200
Excuse me.
All workers punch in at the rear entrance.

292
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,800
- He's with me.
- That don't make any difference.

293
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,600
- Do you know who I am?
- No, sir.

294
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,400
Dr Blalock, Chief Surgical Professor.

295
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,600
I'm sorry, Dr Blalock, but that's the rules.

296
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I'll meet you in the labs, Vivien.

297
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,000
Hey, you need to punch in first.

298
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,200
Thank you.

299
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,800
I can see we've arrived.

300
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,600
When was the last time
they used this place?

301
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:15,800
Have someone clean it up. I'll meet you
in an hour at the Harriet Lane wards.

302
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:20,000
Let's see if there's anything
in this idea of Dr Taussig's.

303
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,800
- Excuse me?
- Good morning.

304
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,400
Where could I find someone
to help us clean up the lab, Doctor?

305
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,000
- Who do you think you're talking to?
- I'm not sure.

306
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,800
I'm Vivien Thomas,
I work for Dr Blalock, running this lab.

307
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,400
I'm Dr Edgar V Hecker.

308
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,000
Director of Laboratories.
I'd like some coffee and a doughnut.

309
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,600
Doctor.

310
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,400
There must be a mix-up.

311
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,600
Listen, I won't stand for insolence.
We'll see about this.

312
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
- Doctor, there aren't many...
- What?

313
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,800
I can't hear too well in this ear.

314
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,600
You're one of the few women doctors
I've seen here.

315
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,800
At least they let me in
through the front door.

316
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,400
This is where we keep
some of the older kids.

317
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,800
Doctor, why do they squat like that?

318
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,400
A little boy told me
that it helps him breathe better.

319
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,800
It cuts off the blood to the legs,
pushes it up into the lungs.

320
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,600
They both look very cyanotic.

321
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,400
Here he is now.

322
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,000
- Dr Blalock. Welcome.
- Helen, sorry.

323
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,000
Here is the Saxon baby
I was telling you about last night.

324
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,200
Thank you.

325
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,000
She usually smiles
when someone does that.

326
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,800
Hello, Mrs Saxon.

327
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,400
- What is that thing?
- It's an oximeter.

328
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:59,000
Reads how much oxygen
there is in the blood.

329
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,200
She looks cold in there.
But I can't hold her.

330
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,000
They say it isn't good for her.
I'm not even supposed to let her cry.

331
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,200
How do you keep a baby from crying?
Especially if you can't hold her.

332
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,600
You can see the change in the shape and size
of the vessels as these hearts grow.

333
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,200
I did necroscopies
on some of my patients' hearts

334
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,200
to study the malformations in detail.

335
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,400
It's amazing they could live at all
with hearts like these.

336
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,200
Dr Gross at Harvard
said only God could correct

337
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,600
a narrowing indentation
of the left side of the aortic arch.

338
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,200
Perhaps that statement says
more about Harvard than about God.

339
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,800
That baby back there. How long?

340
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,000
Six months. A year at the very most.

341
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,600
- That's not right.
- Are you going to take this on, Doctor?

342
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,800
I want to see all your diagnostic notes.

343
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,800
I'll get them right away.

344
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,000
Thank you.

345
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,800
Put away the books, Vivien.

346
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,600
Let's not waste any more time
on theoretical crap.

347
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,800
Let's start with experiments.

348
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,400
Four separate defects of the heart
working in combination.

349
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,200
The pulmonary artery is constricted

350
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:47,200
in the main artery before the divide,
diminishing blood supply to both lungs.

351
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,600
And the hole in the septum

352
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,800
causes the used blood
to flow back into the arterial system

353
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:59,400
instead of flowing through the lungs,
turning the babies blue.

354
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,400
A baby's heart is delicate.

355
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,600
It's a goddamn minefield.

356
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,800
The first step is to see if we can create
the blue baby condition in a dog...

357
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,200
and then come up with a plan to solve it.

358
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,600
You drink too much coffee.

359
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,000
Balzac drank 300 cups of coffee in one day.

360
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,800
Of course, he died of a perforated ulcer.

361
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,400
Odds are against us
reproducing this in the laboratory.

362
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,400
Are you sure this is a limb
you want to climb out on?

363
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,800
Back in '29, when I had TB...

364
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,600
the x-rays showed a big gaping hole
in my left lung.

365
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,400
I laid there on a freezing porch

366
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,600
in a sanatorium in upstate New York

367
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,800
with 18 blankets on me.

368
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,600
Nothing but my nose
exposed to the elements.

369
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,000
Death's a very humbling thing to live with
day in and day out.

370
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,800
I swore then...

371
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,200
if I got my life back,
I would do something important with it.

372
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:31,800
I know, in every fibre of my being

373
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,000
that this is a limb I want to climb out on.

374
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:42,600
It'll be hell trying to work with a child's vessels
three or four millimetres thick.

375
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,200
Like sewing over
cooked spaghetti noodles.

376
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,600
We'll need the smallest sutures.

377
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,800
We'll need to make our own tools.

378
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,800
- We could be in for trouble, Vivien.
- Big trouble.

379
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,200
<i>- Dr Alfred Blalock to OR, please.</i>
- They're driving me crazy.

380
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,600
This goddamn war.

381
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,600
We don't have enough doctors.
My surgery cases are through the roof.

382
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,600
If I'm not operating, I'm teaching.

383
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,600
You're gonna have to do
most of this research.

384
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,600
What'll you need?

385
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,400
I need a bulldog clamp
small enough for the baby

386
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,400
but strong enough
to stop the flow of blood.

387
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,600
What about a breathing device?

388
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:33,200
I'd love a Positive Pressure Respirator,
but with this war going on...

389
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,000
How in hell can I do the experiments
if I can't even get the equipment?

390
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,400
Shut up.

391
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,600
You surely pissed off Ed Hecker.

392
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,000
You mean I disturbed his afternoon nap?

393
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,800
What is it with you
and that boy of yours? Thomas.

394
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,600
Why'd you bring him up here?

395
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,800
We've been together more than 12 years.

396
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,800
He's a really good worker.

397
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,600
How about a little wager?

398
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,600
$50?

399
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,400
- Give him a break, Dick.
- You're on.

400
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,800
There's a rumour going around
you're contemplating heart surgery.

401
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,600
That's an intriguing rumour.

402
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,600
Wouldn't it be a feather in our cap
if we were the first ones to do it?

403
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,000
Indeed, it would.
But I hope you'll forgive my scepticism.

404
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,600
There is no reason for us
to think it's possible.

405
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,600
And every indicator says it can't be done.

406
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,400
Most of us agree, Al, the risks are huge.

407
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,600
There isn't even any incremental progress.

408
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,400
Where you see risks, I see opportunity.

409
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,200
You gotta take care of that sink up in 4-B.
And you were gonna fix these steps.

410
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,600
Yes, forgive me,
I've been very busy at work.

411
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,200
The deal is $7 off for odd jobs every month.
You gotta pick up the pace.

412
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,600
<i>With Allied forces fighting at Cassino,</i>

413
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:46,600
<i>German Field Marshal Kesselring has earned</i>
<i>a reputation as one of our few...</i>

414
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,600
This is good, sweetheart.
It's got some kick to it tonight.

415
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,400
It's the same as last night.
Just put it on a different side of the plate.

416
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,600
Sometimes it's better the next day.

417
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,400
I hope so, cos guess what?

418
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,200
Tomorrow it's hash à la king.

419
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,400
It's hash à la queen tonight.

420
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,400
I could get a job.

421
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,000
Who'll look after the girls?

422
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,800
I know it's not Nashville.

423
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:44,000
And I know... I wouldn't be able to do
what I'm doing without you.

424
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,800
My father took care of us,
I'll take care of you.

425
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,600
And everything's gonna be just fine.
We'll be just fine here.

426
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,000
You're right. We'll be fine here.

427
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,600
We're gonna run out of dogs at this rate.

428
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,200
It's been three months,
and all I'm closer to is retirement.

429
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,800
Things move slow sometimes.
No matter what you want.

430
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,000
I'm getting close. I've got 30% desaturation.

431
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,800
That dog was faintly blue at best. We must get
the dog in the same state as the baby.

432
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:26,200
- What is the problem?
- Every time I constrict, it kills the dogs.

433
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,600
I've tried nylon, ligature,
umbilical tape, ox facet.

434
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,400
We need a new approach.

435
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,800
OK, forget constriction.

436
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,800
Try a partial lobectomy.
Remove both lobes of the right lung.

437
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,600
Do an arteries-to-veins fistula,
where the medial wall of the aorta

438
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,600
and the pulmonary artery adhere.

439
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
I'll be in the OR.

440
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,400
That's a very good idea, Doctor.
Thank you.

441
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,200
- Damn it!
- You did the best you could.

442
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,800
With his condition,
you never had a chance.

443
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,800
I always have a chance.

444
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,200
Get me his autopsy.

445
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,400
Shit.

446
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,000
Damn.

447
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
- What's that?
- Our new respirator.

448
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,400
I was rummaging around
the machine shop.

449
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,800
It's not pretty but it works.

450
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,200
It is pretty.

451
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,200
I knew I could count on you.
You're the only one I can trust around here.

452
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,800
I suspect others relish the thought
of seeing me fail.

453
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,600
Mary!

454
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,600
- There's an ambulance in the driveway.
- Good evening.

455
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,600
General Cunningham needed help
carting wounded Gl's off the ship.

456
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,400
So I volunteered to be a driver on the base.

457
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,000
- That's wonderful.
- Not really.

458
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,800
I've got a lot of time on my hands.

459
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,200
She wouldn't go to bed?

460
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,200
Not until you came home.

461
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,200
You know what she said today?

462
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,800
She said she wanted to be a patient
when she grows up

463
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,000
so she can get to see her daddy.

464
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,600
I don't remember you wearing a tool belt
at your coming-out party.

465
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,600
Guess it has been a couple of weeks
since I made it home before 11:00.

466
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,800
No, it's 23 days.

467
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,800
Not as if I don't know
the lot of a doctor's wife.

468
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,400
But I miss you.

469
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,000
It's gonna change.

470
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,800
It's probably gonna get worse.

471
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,600
- Hey, Vivien.
- Dr Longmire.

472
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,600
- Is Dr Blalock in?
- No, he's not.

473
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,600
I don't know where he is.
You should check his office.

474
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,400
That's an interesting procedure.
Never seen a clamp like that before.

475
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:07,400
- It's for small vascular work.
- Where'd you get it?

476
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,400
I pieced it together
from some things lying around.

477
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,200
Now we're getting somewhere.

478
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,800
You're not even looking.

479
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,800
It's like when you come home
late at night, you know?

480
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,800
You know the feel of the room in the dark.

481
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,800
- That looks impossible.
- No, if I can do it, you can do it.

482
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,800
You see, this string here?

483
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,200
That's how you get traction on the suture

484
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,200
cos you need a lot of exposure
for the anastomosis.

485
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,400
I'd like to work with you sometime.

486
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,000
Fine, Dr Longmire, that'd be fine.

487
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,600
My emergency rotation starts in ten minutes,
but I can come in on Thursday.

488
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,200
That'd be fine.
You have a good day, Doctor.

489
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:51,600
- What are you doing here?
- I was in the neighbourhood.

490
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,600
Supreme Court, finally made it.

491
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:58,600
A long time. You been working
on this case for what, nine years?

492
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,400
- No, 12 years.
- 12 years?

493
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,200
Time.

494
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,800
So, tell me, what was it like?

495
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,600
Nine white guys in big gowns
walked in first.

496
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,600
Then the school board lawyers.

497
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:18,600
Our lawyer, Thurgood Marshall,
he looked kind of lonely in there.

498
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,200
You know what them people
said in their brief?

499
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,600
Said since coloured teachers in Nashville
live so cheaply...

500
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:28,600
they should pay us
a whole lot less than white teachers.

501
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,800
But let me tell you,
Thurgood said he'd be goddamned

502
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,600
if they could get away with that.

503
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:37,600
So he gets up and says to that white lawyer,
"You're full of it.

504
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,400
"Have you ever read the Constitution?

505
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,200
"The damned 14th Amendment.
The equal protection clause says

506
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,200
"A government can't discriminate
based on race."

507
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,200
Yes, Lord. I mean he was good, Viv.

508
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,000
I think we got the Board of Education
on the run.

509
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,600
That's good news, Harold.
So when will they decide?

510
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,600
Could be months, longer.

511
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,600
I don't know, but I can wait.
After all these years.

512
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,000
All those calls I got late at night.

513
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,600
White folk telling me they gonna kill me
if I don't drop this lawsuit.

514
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,800
No, you gotta show them
you won't take that treatment.

515
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,600
Wait. Listen to me when I tell you,
you need to leave this sorry-ass place

516
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,000
and that dead-end job.

517
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Harold, Dr Blalock's
doing the best he can for me.

518
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,600
It's not enough.

519
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,200
He trusts me to carry out those experiments on
my own.

520
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,200
- I'm running the whole lab.
- But does he compensate you for that?

521
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:36,200
- Vivien's doing important research now.
- He's forgetting what Granddaddy told us.

522
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,200
He said he regretted acting so grateful
for being free

523
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,600
for what wasn't any freedom at all.

524
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,400
I know, I remember.

525
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,800
What you giving him extra for?
What's wrong with me?

526
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,600
Nothing minding your own business
wouldn't cure.

527
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:08,200
You got that white coat, but you're just
a class three worker, same as me.

528
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:14,200
In fact, I got two years' seniority on you.
I'm making more than you.

529
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,200
Don't think you're
some kind of big shot around here.

530
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,800
Excuse me, buddy.
Class three. What does that mean?

531
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,000
It means salary grade.

532
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:27,400
And, ma'am, and this here? What's this?

533
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,600
Job classification.

534
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,600
What is class three?

535
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,600
Maintenance worker.

536
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,800
I'm a lab technician. That can't be.

537
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,800
"Vivien Thomas".

538
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,400
OK. Here we go.

539
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,000
"Vivien Thomas, class three."

540
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,200
Thank you.

541
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,200
- How's it going?
- The vessel's tolerating ligation.

542
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,200
Any progress?

543
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,600
If you kill that dog,
I swear I will take it out of your pay cheque.

544
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:26,400
I'm finished here. Dr Longmire, would you mind
closing up for me? Thank you.

545
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,600
Come on, Vivien.

546
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,600
I was kidding
about taking it out of your pay cheque.

547
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:00,200
Good luck, cos I only make $16 a week.

548
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,600
- For a 16-hour day.
- That's all they can pay.

549
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,400
That's all they can pay class three workers.

550
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,600
What are you talking about?

551
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,600
That's my job classification.

552
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,600
Who cares what they call you?

553
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,400
You and I both know
how valuable the work is that you do.

554
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:26,000
If my work is so important,
then why am I class three?

555
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,200
Two grades below what I do.
In classification and pay.

556
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:34,400
I don't know why.
I don't pay attention to bureaucratic details.

557
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:38,200
Look, at Hopkins you can't be a technician
without a college degree.

558
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,800
- And where are you going?
- I need to fix some steps.

559
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,200
We have work to do.

560
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:50,600
Do I have your permission to do some work for
my landlord so I can pay my rent?

561
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,400
Dr Blalock, could you come here, please?

562
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,000
You're not gonna believe this.

563
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Look at the oximeter.

564
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,600
The gums are blue, Doctor. Vivien did it.

565
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Off, Alfred.

566
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:33,400
I brought him up here.
I gave him this opportunity.

567
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:37,200
I don't set the pay scale.
I just don't see what more I can do.

568
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,200
You're probably feeling guilty.

569
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,000
What the hell do I have to feel guilty about?

570
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,200
- For not sending him to college.
- You think I should have sent him?

571
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,600
Sure. Why not?
You told me that was his dream.

572
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:54,600
- He even mentioned it to me once.
- You know I need him in the lab.

573
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,600
I guess there's only so much good
one person can do.

574
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,600
Congratulations on the dog.

575
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,200
The kind of raise you're suggesting...
How important is this?

576
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:12,000
He makes it possible for me
to be in many places at the same time.

577
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,800
Can't you just hire a college kid?

578
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,600
No, I can't. His hands are important to me.

579
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,400
He's good at following my instructions.

580
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,600
Better than anyone I've encountered.

581
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:26,800
You want me to circumvent regulations
on behalf of a coloured helper?

582
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,600
Walter, I'm close
to accomplishing something.

583
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:34,800
I need him with me so I can continue with my
research. Can I count on your help?

584
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,200
Hello, Clara.

585
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,800
Dr Blalock.

586
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,600
Come in, sir.

587
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,200
Thank you.

588
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,600
Is Vivien at home?

589
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,400
Yes, he's putting the kids down.

590
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,600
You know, in 13 years, Dr Blalock,

591
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:12,000
I don't recall
you ever stopping by our house.

592
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I don't recall ever being invited.

593
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:19,600
Professor. Did something happen?

594
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:24,400
Yes, I obtained a raise for you. $25 extra
a month on top of what you're making.

595
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,200
That's $300 for the whole year.

596
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:31,400
- What job classification?
- Surgical technician. I got you promoted.

597
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,800
Promoted. To what he already does.

598
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,400
Excuse me.

599
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:49,200
Now you can pay your rent
and put all your focus on our research.

600
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,000
Back there in the lab with Pontius,
what did you do?

601
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,600
What you suggested. A partial fistula.

602
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:59,000
I stitched the main arteries
and veins together, end-to-end,

603
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,200
and two lobes in the lungs.

604
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
We created a blue baby's heart in that dog.

605
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,200
Did we?

606
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:14,000
Now we have our disease model,
we can find a cure.

607
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,200
And much as I enjoyed
coming here to see you,

608
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,200
would you mind terribly
if I got you a telephone?

609
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,000
No, not at all.

610
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,800
Thank you.

611
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,600
A shunt.

612
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,400
I'm sorry, Doctor. What'd you say?

613
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,600
We need to create a shunt
to get more oxygenated blood to the lungs.

614
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,800
Can't see how to do it.

615
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Remember back in Vanderbilt
when we were doing the research

616
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,200
on how to create high blood pressure
in the lungs?

617
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:01,400
Yes, I connected the subclavian
to the pulmonary artery.

618
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:08,200
We failed to get the higher blood pressure
but we did get higher blood flow.

619
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:14,800
Which is exactly
what Dr Taussig said these babies need.

620
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:19,600
That's it. We build a bypass.

621
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,800
Take an artery and redirect it.

622
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:29,000
- Systemic artery to the pulmonary artery.
- Through the lungs.

623
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,600
It's a long way around,
but it gets you there.

624
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,600
If we work from the right side,
we have an advantage there.

625
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,600
But the recurrent nerve is in the way,
and if we kink that...

626
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,600
- Vocal cords parallel.
- And the carotid's here.

627
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,600
We may kill the brain if we damage that.

628
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,800
Comforting thought.

629
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
The subclavian...

630
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,800
Tie it off here.

631
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,000
After the divide...

632
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:09,200
cut it right under the clavicle.

633
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,600
Swing it down.

634
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,400
Long, slow general arc.

635
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,400
Will it hold if we pull it down four inches?

636
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,000
If your hands don't get too excited.

637
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,800
Thank you for the vote of confidence.

638
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,800
No one's ever done anything
as hard as this.

639
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,400
Changing the course of blood.

640
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,800
And turn blue into pink.

641
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,600
And death into life.

642
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,200
I don't care what the chart says.

643
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,600
This girl wants to live.

644
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,400
- Retractor.
- No, suture.

645
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,200
Can't we try things my way occasionally?

646
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,800
Oh, all right. Sutures.

647
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:41,000
Do you mind
if I show you something, Doctor?

648
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,600
Thank you.

649
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,200
- Do you need any help?
- No, that's fine. Thank you.

650
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:09,000
I have to purse-string the anastomosis.

651
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,600
OK, there. He's all yours, Doctor.

652
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,800
Do you feel the connection?

653
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:29,000
Are you sure you did this, Vivien?

654
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,800
This is like something the Lord made.

655
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,200
Look, Mr Saxon, Mrs Saxon.

656
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:47,200
I acknowledge that these
are uncharted waters. There are risks.

657
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:53,200
But I think we have found a way
to repair your daughter's heart.

658
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,600
How?

659
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,600
You're stationed, where,
Norfolk, is it, Mr Saxon?

660
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:04,200
Yes, sir. Been working on the Spencer,
trying to get her back out to sea.

661
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:07,800
- You work on the engines, right?
- Yes, sir.

662
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:13,000
I'd be changing around some of the piping
leading to and from your daughter's heart.

663
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:19,400
- Just switching around the pipes?
- Yes.

664
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:26,000
Arteries that bring the blood to and
from the heart to the lungs act like pipes.

665
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,200
I've been successful,
switching them around.

666
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:35,800
- It's that easy?
- No, it's not that easy.

667
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:40,200
No surgery is. And this operation has special
complications.

668
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,800
But I still think it's worth doing.

669
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:57,800
- We're going to talk about this, Doctor.
- Good idea.

670
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,000
It's going to be a lot harder with a baby.

671
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,600
We're going to have to collapse
one of her lungs.

672
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,800
She's already so cyanotic.

673
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,800
She's not getting enough oxygen

674
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:19,800
and we're going to have to take away
half of her lung function.

675
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,800
- You made those new clamps yet?
- I'm working on it.

676
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:31,000
What if I shred her insides
with those clamps? So many ways to fail.

677
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,800
Every second counts.

678
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,800
A single minute is too long.

679
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:39,600
A single minute
of poor blood flow to the brain,

680
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:44,400
a single second of open bleeding...

681
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:51,200
Are you saying I shouldn't allow this doctor
to perform a miracle to save my baby?

682
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,800
We don't get to demand miracles.

683
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:58,800
Honey, God has his plans.
Maybe we just have to accept it.

684
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:03,000
But I was so happy
when I was pregnant with Eileen.

685
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,800
You know, I haven't had enough time.
Why can't God let me get to know her first?

686
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:12,000
I mean, I don't want to go against Him.

687
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,600
But why can't His plan be...

688
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:17,000
to let this doctor save her life?

689
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,800
Professor Blalock?

690
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,600
Mrs Saxon told me
you plan to operate on her baby.

691
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,600
- Have you seen this child?
- I check on her every day.

692
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:32,200
And you're still going to proceed?
Have you had any success in the lab?

693
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,800
Absolutely. I successfully performed
a shunt on a dog just two weeks ago.

694
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:41,400
I can't imagine you're going to proceed
based on the laboratory success on a dog.

695
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,400
How many people have you saved?

696
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:49,200
You're performing an experiment,
not an operation.

697
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:53,200
My instincts tell me
nature made a mistake and I can fix it.

698
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,600
Would you like to see
what I've been doing, Father?

699
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:12,000
Right now my instincts tell me perhaps you
should come back another day.

700
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:16,400
What? Your quest for glory is vain, arrogant.

701
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:20,000
It takes arrogance to cut someone
to save their life.

702
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,200
I have no doubt.
But if you intervene with God's will,

703
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,400
violate the purity of an innocent heart,

704
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:31,400
the parents, not you, Doctor,
will bear the burden of guilt.

705
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:35,800
Perhaps God is, as you say,
trying to kill this child.

706
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,400
I am not.

707
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,600
Look at this. The shunt gave out.

708
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,800
Looks like a train wreck.

709
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,600
What happened to you, Pontius?

710
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,400
- Maybe we should just stop here, Doctor.
- No.

711
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,800
We using the wrong vessel?

712
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,400
What the hell's going on?

713
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,800
Viv, get up.

714
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,600
Wake up. It's OK.

715
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,800
It's OK, baby.

716
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,600
- It's just a nightmare.
- My God.

717
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:36,600
Where the hell have you been, Vivien?

718
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:40,800
I had a dream
about this white woman last night.

719
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:43,800
Perhaps that's something
best kept to yourself.

720
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:50,000
No. I knew it was Eileen Saxon.
She was all grown up.

721
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
She was sitting there in a corner.
She was knitting.

722
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:59,400
And she let out a baby voice
and she fell over dead.

723
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:04,000
I couldn't see it but I knew on the inside
she had a baby heart.

724
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,200
- She just fell over dead.
- What the hell does that have to do with...

725
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:17,200
The stitches didn't grow.

726
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:21,800
When we did the shunt on Pontius,
he was ten pounds. He went up to 20.

727
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,200
- He pulled it loose.
- Purse-stringing doesn't work.

728
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,600
We need a new stitching technique.

729
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:34,000
Continuous on the back wall, interrupted
on the front wall. That's what we need.

730
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,800
And then the shunt will grow.

731
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,800
65% oxygenation.
She's deteriorating so rapidly.

732
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:44,600
- Have we time to practise the operation?
- We can't let up.

733
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,400
- What about the new stitching technique?
- We're trying it tomorrow.

734
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,000
You have to see this. Vivien Thomas is
operating, assisted by the Chief of Surgery.

735
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,400
Pull the inbound vein anastomosis.

736
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,800
Long, slow, general arc.

737
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:13,200
I can't see. Can you see, Vivien?
Could you adjust that lamp?

738
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,800
Are the clamps still holding?

739
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,600
- Yes.
- No kinking?

740
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,200
None.

741
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,800
All right, now for the tough part.

742
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:27,800
Continuous sutures on the back wall...

743
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,600
interrupted on the front.

744
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Removing bulldog clamp.

745
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,800
Come on, girl.

746
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,800
Come on, please.

747
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,800
That's it, a little bit more.

748
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,200
I can feel the flow to the lungs.

749
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:07,600
- Helen, tell the Saxons we'll be operating.
- You bet.

750
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,800
You'll be ready.

751
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:16,800
Yes, now that I've seen the master at work.

752
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,800
Master of the hounds.

753
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,200
Your daddy should be proud of you.

754
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,200
I think he is.

755
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:27,000
Mine was only proud of the fact
that I could wiggle my ears.

756
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,800
I think he'll be proud when you operate.

757
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:31,800
He's dead.

758
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:35,400
The dead are with us all the time, I believe.

759
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,800
Can't separate the past from the future

760
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:41,000
any more than you can
your right arm from your left arm.

761
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:45,000
But you see, they are separated

762
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
by this, by the heart.

763
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Or connected.

764
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,200
Or connected.

765
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,200
Noli tangere. Do not touch.

766
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Do not touch the heart.

767
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:16,000
We are gonna challenge
this ancient doctrinal myth in this hospital.

768
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,800
Who wants to attend?

769
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:24,600
Dr Swedlin?

770
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,000
Dr Philmore?

771
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,400
Dr Cooley.

772
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,200
And Dr Longmire.

773
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,600
Thank you.

774
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:55,000
You're dangling your reputation off a cliff.

775
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,200
Calm down. This isn't grand opera.

776
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:01,000
Isn't a doctor's first tenet, "Do no harm"?

777
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,400
What are you saying?

778
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:06,200
Postpone it until you have more experience.

779
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,400
That means signing that baby's death warrant.

780
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:11,400
- I will not do that.
- But they'll ruin you.

781
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:15,400
Walter, I'm operating tomorrow.

782
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:24,600
You're rushing this because
you don't want to admit to those parents

783
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,600
that you spoke too soon.

784
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:53,600
- You should come to bed.
- I tried that.

785
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:59,400
Can I give you a ride
to the hospital tomorrow?

786
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,800
Thanks.

787
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:05,800
I could use the lift.
I don't trust myself behind the wheel.

788
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,800
Al, anybody would be nervous.

789
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
It's not that.

790
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:19,200
I was just thinking about a remark
you made.

791
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:23,800
You said I used to be wild,
not just ambitious.

792
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,400
But I wonder if my ambition
hasn't driven me wild.

793
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,200
Dr Taussig, Professor.

794
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:37,000
I just wanted to wish good luck
to everyone.

795
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,800
- Thank you, Vivien.
- Thanks, Vivien.

796
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:57,400
We're going to block that baby's
pulmonary artery for 30 minutes.

797
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:03,600
As long as her blood pressure doesn't go
below 60, I think she should be fine.

798
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,600
I don't think
she can survive much lower than that.

799
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,800
- Isn't that right, Dr Harmel?
- Not below 60. That's right.

800
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,200
Dr Blalock, they're ready.

801
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:19,200
Doctor.

802
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,400
Coming in now.

803
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,400
Dr Longmire.

804
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,600
What is going on?

805
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,600
They won't page him.

806
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,600
- Why not?
- Something about hospital policy.

807
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,800
Page Vivien Thomas immediately.

808
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,800
Dr Blalock, what's wrong?

809
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,400
It's all right.
I won't tell you again. Page him.

810
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:33,400
- We're only allowed to page doctors.
- Give me that goddamn phone.

811
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:38,000
Vivien Thomas, paging Vivien Thomas.

812
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,000
<i>You're wanted in OR right now.</i>
<i>Come on the run, do you hear?</i>

813
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,400
This is Blalock.

814
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,400
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

815
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,600
Jesus.

816
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:59,400
About time. Scrub up.

817
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,400
- Scrub up?
- You're coming in with me.

818
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:06,600
- Find Mr Thomas something to stand on.
- What for, Doctor?

819
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:09,800
You're talking me through this.
Now scrub up.

820
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,200
What's he doing here?

821
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:26,600
- What the hell is that?
- I'll see about this.

822
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,800
Should we say a prayer?

823
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:33,000
Forget it. He won't listen to me.

824
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,800
Dr Blalock, a word.

825
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,600
- You can resume your duties.
- These are his duties.

826
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,400
- Can you see now?
- Yes, Doctor.

827
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,800
OK, I think we're ready to start.

828
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:56,200
OK. We're going in.

829
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:06,800
It's going to be all right. It'll be just fine.

830
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,800
She'll be all right.

831
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:15,800
lncising the mediastinal pleura

832
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,600
from the main left pulmonary artery.

833
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,000
To the apex of the pleural space.

834
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,600
I'm dissecting the pulmonary artery.

835
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,800
Well back into the mediastinum.

836
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:30,600
- This all right, Vivien?
- That looks fine.

837
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:34,400
The right-angle clamp.

838
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,800
OK, I think it's holding.

839
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,800
Are you able to deliver
the left subclavian artery?

840
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:54,200
I believe so. Blood pressure?

841
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,400
70, falling.

842
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,400
Do not move that light.

843
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,600
And now...

844
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,800
- I'm dividing the...
- Careful.

845
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,800
- Clamp it.
- I can't reach it, Doctor.

846
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,800
I got it. Haemorrhage controlled.

847
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Can you see, Doctor?

848
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,800
Not really. Nurse.

849
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:40,600
For goodness sake,
can't you even see my ears?

850
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,400
Sorry, Doctor.

851
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,800
Suture.

852
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,600
- Blood pressure is 68.
- Yes, go on.

853
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,200
Watch the carotid.

854
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:08,000
- Yes, traction on the suture.
- OK, now the clamp Vivien made.

855
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:13,200
- What clamp?
- The one just there. Right there, yes.

856
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,400
We're about to connect the shunt.

857
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,400
Blood pressure is 60.

858
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:25,200
- No, 59.
- I know, I'm almost there.

859
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,800
Now front, interrupted.

860
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,400
That's good, Doctor. Just a little more now.

861
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,400
Removing the bulldog clamp.

862
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:06,600
- I see some bleeding right...
- I know. I see it, too. Suture.

863
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:18,000
- No, Doctor, the other way.
- Yes, yes.

864
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,600
Good, you got it now.

865
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:27,600
Bleeding controlled.

866
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,800
I'm palpating the connection.

867
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,600
What do you feel?

868
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,400
I can't tell
if blood is flowing through the shunt.

869
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,000
It's just too small to feel anything.

870
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,800
Dr Blalock, you have to see this.

871
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,400
My God.

872
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,000
Her blood pressure is rising.

873
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:19,600
Evacuate the blood in the chest cavity.
Put in the chest tube.

874
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:22,800
Reinflating the left lung with oxygen.

875
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:25,200
Ready for closure.

876
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:40,200
Who would have thought it possible?

877
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:43,800
Heart surgery.
And we did it right here in Johns Hopkins.

878
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:50,400
- Thank you, Dr Blalock.
- Thank you so much.

879
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,800
I knew you could do it.

880
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,800
- Some operation.
- Amazing.

881
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:11,800
That child's chances were so slim. Took
a hell of a surgeon to pull her through.

882
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,800
He was lucky
to have that nigger in there with him.

883
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,600
Thomas sure saved his ass.

884
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:20,200
I'd like to see him try it without him.

885
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,600
You did well in there, Vivien.

886
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,000
Thank you.

887
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,400
You performed an excellent surgery, Doctor.

888
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:44,800
Yes.

889
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,400
I think I did.

890
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:23,800
Please. I understand. But this is a hospital.
Please keep your voices down.

891
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,800
I can understand how you all must feel

892
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:30,400
but we have been overwhelmed
with children

893
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:33,200
and there's just one doctor
to perform the operations.

894
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,800
So if you just go to the administration office,

895
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:40,200
they'll accommodate all of you into Dr Blalock's
schedule as soon as possible.

896
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,800
All right? I'm terribly sorry.

897
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:48,400
Making the first incision.

898
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,600
- Are you there, Vivien?
- Yes, I'm here.

899
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:00,800
Thank you for the opportunity to observe,
Dr Blalock.

900
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,400
- It's an honour.
- Excellent work, gentlemen.

901
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,800
Thank you. May I introduce my colleagues.

902
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:10,800
Dr Helen Taussig, Vivien Thomas.
This is Dr Craford, from Stockholm.

903
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,800
And Dr Petrovsky from Leningrad.

904
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:18,200
You have given surgeons around the world
great courage with your deeds.

905
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:23,200
Coming from such an eminent surgeon
as yourself, that is a compliment, indeed.

906
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,600
It's been a pleasure to meet you,
Dr Taussig.

907
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,600
- Thank you.
- Dr Thomas.

908
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,600
Call me Mr Thomas, or Vivien.

909
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,600
You're not a doctor?

910
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:36,000
No, I just work here with Dr Blalock.

911
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:42,200
Can we have the doctors who participated in
the "Blue Baby" operation in this shot?

912
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:47,200
There's a young woman who hitchhiked
from Appalachia with her son.

913
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:51,200
And I think his blood levels
may be low enough to test.

914
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:54,000
Talk to Dr Taussig
about scheduling him in.

915
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:58,400
If you'd all turn and face the centre, please,
like Dr Longmire.

916
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:02,000
- Helen.
- Very good.

917
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:05,600
Thank you,
now focus your attention here, please.

918
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,600
Smile, focus here. Hold that.

919
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:13,000
Good. Now if we could have
one of you alone, Dr Blalock.

920
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:21,200
Very good, sir. Focus here, if you would.

921
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:23,600
Here we go, Doctor.

922
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,800
Thank you very much.

923
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:42,800
They're nice pictures, aren't they?
They always have nice pictures.

924
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:47,200
Just cos you're not in the news
doesn't mean you weren't there, Viv.

925
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,600
I'll be back.

926
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:36,400
A man who is a real pioneer,

927
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:40,000
a gambler who takes all the right risks,

928
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:43,800
who's rescued untold lives
with his work in shock

929
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:48,600
and has gone on to challenge
the entire medical establishment

930
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:51,400
to reconsider an age-old taboo

931
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:55,800
in performing
the world's first heart surgery.

932
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,200
Now, without embarrassing myself,

933
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:05,200
I'd like to introduce a man
who has undeniably brought a dash of pink

934
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:07,600
to the cheeks of others.

935
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:10,800
Dr Alfred Blalock.

936
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:40,200
Thank you. I am indeed honoured.

937
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:50,200
And while I am grateful for the many gifts
that have been given to me in my life,

938
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:55,000
perhaps the greatest gift has been

939
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:00,200
the support of my colleagues
over this last year.

940
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:02,800
My good friend, Walter Dandy.

941
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:08,800
The wonderful, brilliant colleagues
who assisted me in our operation -

942
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,400
Dr Helen Taussig,

943
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,400
Dr William Longmire,

944
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,800
Dr Denton Cooley,

945
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,800
and Dr Merel Harmel.

946
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:23,400
I believe one group of people

947
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:28,000
could not have accomplished
so much in so little time

948
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,800
without a strong, unified effort

949
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:37,600
in the spirit of breaking new ground together.

950
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:44,600
To further the reach of medicine
is one that should be cherished

951
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,200
and never allowed to die.

952
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,600
What the hell is this?

953
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,800
I need to do something different.

954
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,600
What about our work?

955
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:24,800
You got all of those other people
you were thanking.

956
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,800
What are you talking about?

957
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,400
Belvedere Hotel.

958
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,400
The Belvedere is segregated.
You were there?

959
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:39,000
Snuck in, just like a bellhop.

960
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,800
Is this about hobnobbing
with the powers that be?

961
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,200
They will never let you into their club.

962
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:48,000
It is naive to think otherwise.
Will you stand still?

963
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,800
I'm not talking about them.
I'm not talking about Hopkins.

964
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,200
- I'm talking about you.
- Me?

965
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:03,800
What have I ever done
except fight in your corner?

966
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:06,800
I have taken you every step of the way
with me,

967
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:10,400
and now you want to throw all that away?
For what?

968
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:14,000
Is that any way to show your gratitude?

969
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:17,000
I don't know. You tell me, Doctor.

970
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:22,800
Vivien, take pride in the fact you have power in
your mind and in your heart.

971
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,600
- And in my hands.
- Exactly, in your hands.

972
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:31,600
We made history together.

973
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
We changed the world.

974
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,400
The world.

975
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:48,600
I'm invisible to the world.

976
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:51,400
I don't mind that. I understand that.

977
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,200
I thought it was different in here.

978
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:14,000
Mr Thomas, I'm a little confused.

979
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:19,600
You want college credit for Morgan State
without actually taking classes?

980
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,000
In certain courses, yes.

981
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,800
I'll take the test. I'll take finals...

982
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:28,600
Chemistry, biochemistry, science, physics.

983
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:31,600
Also, I can get the credit
for material I already know.

984
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:37,400
I need to get through college a little more
quickly so I can get on to med school.

985
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:41,800
You actually participated in all this
groundbreaking research, Mr Thomas?

986
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:43,600
Yes, I did.

987
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:48,200
I'm afraid it just doesn't work like that.

988
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,600
You'll have to start with Freshman English.

989
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:53,600
Social Science, maybe.

990
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:56,800
I don't have time for that.

991
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,800
I'm 35 years old.

992
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,000
You're saying
that I have to start at the beginning?

993
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:10,200
Yes, Mr Thomas.
I'm afraid that is in fact what I'm saying.

994
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:15,000
I thought this institution
provided opportunity for coloured people?

995
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
I have a wife, two young daughters, son.

996
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,400
And I've been working in my field
for over...

997
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:26,000
Almost 15 years now.
I'm from Nashville, I came...

998
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:53,600
And what can I do for you?

999
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:58,600
My name is Vivien Thomas.
I work for the Ralph Wintham company.

1000
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:03,200
We have a line of pharmaceuticals,
particularly antacids.

1001
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:06,000
We already have a supplier of antacids.

1002
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:12,200
Yes, well, these antacids
block against gastroesophageal reflux

1003
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:15,600
- without any adverse side effect...
- Vivien Thomas.

1004
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,000
The fellow with the blue babies?

1005
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,800
A patient of mine who works at the hospital
told me about you.

1006
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:29,400
Hopkins is doing well
because of what you did for them and...

1007
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,200
here you are.

1008
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:38,800
I don't have anything against the hospital.

1009
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,800
I'm just working in medicine
in a different way now.

1010
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:48,400
Let's see what other lines you have.

1011
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:51,800
Yes, we have effervescent powder here...

1012
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,800
Oh, William, look who's here.

1013
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:08,200
- Hello.
- Say hi to Grandma.

1014
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:11,800
My goodness.

1015
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:16,600
How you doing, sweetheart? Look at him.

1016
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:25,800
Stop running. Go up and wash your hands.
And bring your little sister down.

1017
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:28,600
And be careful on them steps.

1018
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:30,400
What about construction?

1019
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:33,600
I keep asking him. "Thomas and Thomas".

1020
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,800
With the building boom, we could clean up.

1021
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:38,400
He know I can't saw a plank worth a damn.

1022
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,200
- That's the truth.
- Yeah, Dad.

1023
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:44,000
I did see that mailbox
leaning to the side a little bit.

1024
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,000
I don't understand why you quit teaching.

1025
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:51,200
I never really liked the classroom
that much, Clara. Too many kids.

1026
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:53,600
But you won the case so...

1027
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:59,000
Exactly. And quitting now means
you've just wasted a whole lot of time.

1028
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,800
- No...
- I don't think it's a waste of time.

1029
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:05,400
If Harold wasn't doing what he was doing,

1030
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:08,800
there'd still be a lot of coloured teachers
getting cheated.

1031
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:13,400
- They ought to name a school after him.
- Yeah. Harold Thomas High.

1032
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,600
Harold Thomas High.

1033
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:19,800
No, most young teachers
don't know anything about that strike.

1034
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:23,200
- They take their pay cheque for granted.
- You're full of excuses.

1035
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:26,200
There's no point in waiting for the world
to thank you.

1036
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:28,000
That bus ain't never going to come.

1037
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,200
- Amen to that.
- I'm not waiting, Pop.

1038
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:36,200
I'm looking for something that excites me
as much as hammering nails pleases you.

1039
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:47,200
Viv, Jeopardy's on.

1040
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:50,200
I'll be in in a minute.

1041
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:54,600
You OK?

1042
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:56,600
I'm fine.

1043
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:59,600
Stomach's bothering me a little bit,
but I'm fine.

1044
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:03,800
Why don't you take those fancy antacid pills
that you always brag about?

1045
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,600
It's your brother?

1046
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:14,000
I miss him. I miss the old Harold.

1047
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:17,400
Seems a little lost now.

1048
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:19,000
I miss you.

1049
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:24,800
Still got my mind in that lab.

1050
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:29,400
It's not just your mind, Viv.
It's your heart, too.

1051
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:34,200
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do, Clara.

1052
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:37,400
I think I've embarrassed myself enough.

1053
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:40,600
I can't go back in there
with my tail between my legs.

1054
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:43,200
It's where you belong, Vivien Thomas.

1055
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:47,600
So how you walk back on in there,
well, that's up to you.

1056
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:52,400
Yes?

1057
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:01,000
Doctor. Good morning.

1058
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:13,600
How was your trip to Europe?

1059
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:18,200
It was very gratifying.

1060
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:24,400
And how well it seems to have stood on its feet
for this moment in time.

1061
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,200
What can I do for you, Vivien?

1062
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:32,000
I've made a mistake...

1063
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,600
and I would like my old position back.

1064
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:41,400
How's it going to be any different?

1065
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:46,600
I'm still the same self-righteous bastard.

1066
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,000
It's not about you.

1067
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:53,600
It's about the work.

1068
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,800
I like the work.

1069
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:07,800
We've got an animal going into shock here.
What do we do, sir?

1070
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:12,400
Did you try clamping off
the lateral part of the atrium?

1071
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,800
Yeah, hold it right there.

1072
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:17,400
- Careful.
- OK.

1073
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Yeah. You handled yourself
well there, Doctor.

1074
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,200
- That's good.
- Thank you.

1075
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,000
It started...

1076
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:34,400
There was a message for you, Mr Thomas.
Dr Blalock wanted to see you.

1077
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:36,600
I'm sorry. Would you tell him I'll see him...

1078
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:39,400
He's about to leave for the day.

1079
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:43,200
Honey, I have to call you back. OK.

1080
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:53,400
How's your girls?

1081
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:58,000
They're fine. They're doing well.
Thea's at Morgan State now.

1082
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,800
- That must feel good.
- Yes.

1083
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:06,400
How are things with you?

1084
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:15,600
I've had the unfortunate experience
of being put in the hands of a surgeon.

1085
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:26,800
You have something on your mind, Doctor?

1086
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:30,200
Yes, Columbia's been dangling
an offer to teach

1087
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:32,400
but I wanted to talk to you first.

1088
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:34,600
I really would like you to come with me.

1089
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:38,400
They know about your work.
You could write your own ticket.

1090
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:42,800
It's hard to imagine being there without you.

1091
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:52,600
I thank you for thinking of me, Doctor.
But I think I should stay here.

1092
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:59,800
We could do great things there.
Wouldn't it be fun to do it one more time?

1093
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:01,400
One more time.

1094
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:07,200
I like what I'm doing.

1095
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:12,800
Teaching, helping people along.
Working with the young doctors.

1096
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:14,600
I like it here at Hopkins.

1097
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:20,200
Yeah, I guess you got your own things
going on here now.

1098
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,400
I recognise this man.

1099
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:27,600
- Man looks very distinguished up there.
- Thank you, Vivien.

1100
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:32,800
- That was a while ago.
- Yeah. I'm feeling the years now.

1101
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,400
Yes.

1102
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:38,400
We all are now.

1103
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,800
You know, Vivien...

1104
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:50,200
they say you haven't really lived...

1105
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:54,000
unless you have a lot to regret.

1106
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,800
I regret...

1107
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,600
I have some regrets.

1108
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:19,000
But I think we should remember
not what we lost...

1109
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:23,800
but what we've done.

1110
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:28,600
All the lives we saved, and we did.

1111
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:34,800
- We saved plenty, didn't we, Vivien?
- Yes, we did.

1112
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:43,200
No.

1113
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:02,200
Vivien, it's Helen.

1114
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:08,800
I'm sorry to tell you that Dr Blalock
passed away in his sleep last night.

1115
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:13,200
We see death every day.
It doesn't make it any easier, does it?

1116
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,400
I'm very sorry.

1117
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:47,200
Today, we honour someone
who never took a course in medical school

1118
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:52,400
and still became
one of our greatest teachers of medicine.

1119
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:58,200
This individual helped change the way
we understand how the human heart works.

1120
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:02,000
And now I'm honoured to read...

1121
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:08,200
"The Board of Regents of this,
the Johns Hopkins University...

1122
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:13,000
"in consideration of an innovative scientist,

1123
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:17,600
"an outstanding teacher,
and a skilled clinical technician,

1124
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:20,800
"has this day
awarded this honorary doctorate

1125
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:24,400
"to Mr Vivien Thomas."

1126
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:47,600
Congratulations, Dr Thomas.

1127
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:08,400
Thank you, Dr Taussig.

1128
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,000
I'm not accustomed
to being in the limelight.

1129
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:20,200
So being placed in the position
I find myself in now

1130
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:23,000
makes me quite humble

1131
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:25,800
and a little proud.

1132
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:33,000
When I put my hammer and saw down
40 years ago

1133
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,800
and was offered an opportunity
to work with a young surgeon,

1134
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:40,600
I had no idea

1135
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:47,200
that I'd be able to make a mark
on an institution as prestigious as this one.

1136
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:54,400
I had no idea that I would have
any contribution to make to medicine

1137
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:59,000
that would merit this type of recognition.

1138
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:12,400
I simply say thank you to all of my family
and all of my friends who are here,

1139
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:18,600
and to all of my friends
who could not be here.

1140
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:20,600
I thank you very much.

1141
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:34,800
This is also a special occasion.

1142
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:38,000
to mark the unveiling
of your likeness, Vivien.

1143
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:11,800
<i>Paging Dr Thomas.</i>
<i>Dr Vivien Thomas to the boardroom, please.</i>
