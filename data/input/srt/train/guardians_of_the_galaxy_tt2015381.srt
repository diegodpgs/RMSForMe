1
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:37,158
Peter.

2
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:41,764
Your momma wants to speak with you.

3
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,010
Come on, Pete.
Take these fool things off.

4
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:25,112
Why have you been fighting
with the other boys again, baby?

5
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,914
Peter?

6
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:32,550
They killed a little frog
that ain't done nothing.

7
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,761
Smushed it with a stick.

8
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:39,395
You're so like your daddy.

9
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,097
You even look like him.

10
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,427
And he was an angel.

11
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:49,533
- Composed out of pure light.
- Mer?

12
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:51,642
You got a present there for Peter,
don't you?

13
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,138
Of course.

14
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:59,410
There.

15
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,918
I've got you covered, Pete.

16
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,191
You open it up when I'm gone, okay?

17
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,293
Your grandpa

18
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,828
is gonna take such good care of you.

19
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:20,802
At least until your daddy
comes back to get you.

20
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:25,644
Take my hand.

21
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:30,878
Peter.

22
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,476
Pete, come on.

23
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,582
Take my hand.

24
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,685
Mom?

25
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,030
No! No! No! No!

26
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:47,460
Mom! No!

27
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,134
- Come with me.
- No!

28
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,031
No!

29
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:52,935
You've got to stay here. Please.

30
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,473
No...

31
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,308
Okay?

32
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,924
No.

33
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,209
Mom!

34
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:27,732
Drop it!

35
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:29,335
Hey.

36
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,107
- Drop it, now!
- Hey, cool, man. No problem.

37
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,146
No problem at all.

38
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,515
How do you know about this?

39
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,141
I don't even know what that is.

40
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,752
I'm just a junker, man.
I was just checking stuff out.

41
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,352
You don't look like a junker.
You're wearing Ravager garb.

42
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,786
This is just an outfit, man.

43
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,257
Ninja Turtle, you better stop poking me.

44
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,427
What is your name?

45
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,495
My name is Peter Quill, okay?
Dude, chill out.

46
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,261
- Move!
- Why?

47
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,296
Ronan may have questions for you.

48
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:55,823
Hey, you know what?

49
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,095
There's another name
you might know me by.

50
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,739
Star-Lord.

51
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,075
Who?

52
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,437
Star-Lord, man. Legendary outlaw.

53
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,939
- Guys?
- Move!

54
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,043
Forget this.

55
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,362
Peter?

56
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,301
What happened?

57
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:11,729
Hey...

58
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:13,894
I...

59
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,671
- Bereet.
- Bereet!

60
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,276
Look, I'm gonna be totally honest
with you. I forgot you're here.

61
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:46,398
<i>Scattered riots broke out</i>
<i>across the Kree Empire today</i>

62
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:49,997
<i>protesting the recent peace treaty</i>
<i>signed by the Kree Emperor</i>

63
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,578
<i>and Xandar's Nova Prime.</i>

64
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,447
Peter, you have call.

65
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,943
- No, wait, don't!
- <i>Quill?</i>

66
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:02,716
Hey, Yondu.

67
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,879
<i>I'm here on Morag.</i>

68
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,251
<i>Ain't no Orb, ain't no you.</i>

69
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,451
Well, I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd save you the hassle.

70
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:09,889
<i>Well, where are you at now, boy?</i>

71
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:12,486
I feel really bad about this,
but I'm not gonna tell you that.

72
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,099
- <i>I slaved putting this deal together.</i>
- Slaved?

73
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:16,291
Making a few calls is "slaved"?
I mean, really?

74
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,369
<i>And now you're gonna rip me off!</i>

75
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:20,972
<i>We do not do that to each other.</i>
<i>We're Ravagers. We got a code.</i>

76
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,870
Yeah, and that code is
"steal from everybody."

77
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,273
<i>When I picked you up on Terra...</i>

78
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:26,411
"Picked me up."

79
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:27,512
<i>... these boys of mine</i>
<i>wanted to eat you.</i>

80
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:28,580
Yeah?

81
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:29,943
<i>They ain't never tasted</i>
<i>any Terran before.</i>

82
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,346
<i>I stopped them.</i>
<i>You're alive because of me!</i>

83
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,645
<i>I will find you, I will...</i>

84
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:35,977
Put a bounty on him!

85
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:37,781
Forty K.

86
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,517
- But I want him back alive.
- Yeah, Cap.

87
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,058
- Alive?
- That's what I said.

88
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,559
I told you when you picked that kid up,

89
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:44,561
you should have delivered him
like we was hired to do!

90
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,254
He was cargo!

91
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,026
You have always been soft on him.

92
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,625
You're the only one I'm being soft on!

93
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,569
Now, don't you worry about Mr. Quill.

94
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,041
As soon as we get him back here,

95
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:59,007
I'm gonna kill him myself.

96
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:00,775
What we do need to worry about,

97
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,581
is who else out there wants that Orb!

98
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,234
<i>They call me "terrorist,"</i>

99
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:30,501
<i>"radical," "zealot,"</i>

100
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:34,505
<i>because I obey the ancient laws</i>
<i>of my people, the Kree,</i>

101
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:38,746
<i>and punish those who do not.</i>

102
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:42,011
<i>Because I do not forgive your people</i>

103
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,679
<i>for taking the life of my father,</i>

104
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,727
<i>and his father,</i>
<i>and his father before him.</i>

105
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:54,558
<i>A thousand years of war between us</i>
<i>will not be forgotten!</i>

106
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,865
You can't do this!
Our government signed a peace treaty.

107
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,301
My government knows no shame.

108
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:05,239
You Xandarians and your culture
are a disease.

109
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,646
You

110
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:10,111
will never rule Xandar.

111
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,205
No.

112
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,244
I will cure it!

113
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:28,490
Ronan,

114
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,498
Korath has returned.

115
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,467
Master, he is a thief,

116
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,964
an outlaw who calls himself Star-Lord.

117
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,609
But we have discovered
he has an agreement

118
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,507
to retrieve the Orb
for an intermediary known

119
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,147
as The Broker.

120
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:46,751
I promised Thanos
I would retrieve the Orb for him.

121
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,412
Only then will he destroy Xandar for me.

122
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:53,723
Nebula, go to Xandar
and get me the Orb.

123
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:55,618
It will be my honor.

124
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:56,783
It will be your doom.

125
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,563
If this happens again,
you'll be facing our father

126
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,428
without his prize.

127
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,001
I'm a daughter of Thanos.

128
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:05,661
Just like you.

129
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,100
But I know Xandar.

130
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:08,865
Ronan has already decreed that I...

131
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,008
Do not speak for me.

132
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,512
You will not fail.

133
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,840
Have I ever?

134
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,732
Xandarians.

135
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:39,097
What a bunch of losers.

136
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:43,573
All of them in a big hurry
to get from something stupid,

137
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,741
to nothing at all. Pathetic.

138
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:47,178
Look at this guy!

139
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,837
Can you believe they call us criminals,

140
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,848
when he's assaulting us
with that haircut?

141
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:54,147
What is this thing?
Look how it thinks it's so cool.

142
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:57,780
It's not cool to get help!
Walk by yourself, you little gargoyle.

143
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,857
Look at Mr. Smiles over here.

144
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,222
Where's your wife, old man?
What a class-A prevert.

145
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,420
Right, Groot?

146
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,024
Groot?

147
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,964
Don't drink fountain water, you idiot.

148
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,330
That's disgusting!

149
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,705
Yes, you did. I just saw you doing it.

150
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:15,899
Why are you lying?

151
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,479
Looks like we got one.

152
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:25,606
Okay, humie, how bad
does someone wanna find you?

153
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:31,283
40,000 units?
Groot, we're gonna be rich.

154
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,566
- Mr. Quill.
- Broker.

155
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:48,940
The Orb.

156
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,970
- As commissioned.
- Where's Yondu?

157
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:54,806
Wanted to be here. Sends his love.

158
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,947
And told me to tell you,

159
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,310
that you got the best eyebrows
in the business.

160
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:01,541
What is it?

161
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:05,688
It's my policy never to discuss
my clients, or their needs.

162
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,759
Yeah, well, I almost died
getting it for you.

163
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:10,827
An occupational hazard,
I'm sure, in your line of work.

164
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,760
Some machine-headed freak,
working for a dude named Ronan.

165
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,099
Ronan? I'm sorry, Mr. Quill.

166
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,258
I truly am.

167
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,033
But I want no part of this transaction
if Ronan is involved.

168
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,201
Who's Ronan?

169
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,607
A Kree fanatic,
outraged by the peace treaty,

170
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:31,979
who will not rest
until Xandarian culture, my culture,

171
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,311
is wiped from existence!

172
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,750
- Come on.
- He's someone

173
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,250
whose bad side I'd rather not be on.

174
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,014
What? What about my bad side?

175
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,452
Farewell, Mr. Quill.

176
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,160
Hey, we had a deal, bro!

177
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,292
What happened?

178
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,472
This guy just backed out of a deal
on me.

179
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,733
If there's one thing I hate,
it's a man without integrity.

180
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,535
Peter Quill. People call me Star-Lord.

181
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,308
You have the bearing of a man of honor.

182
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,541
Well, you know, I wouldn't say that.

183
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,285
People say it about me, all the time,

184
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,922
but it's not something
I would ever say about myself.

185
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,834
This wasn't the plan.

186
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,539
Put him in the bag. Put him in the bag!

187
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,909
No! Not her, him!

188
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,516
Learn genders, man.

189
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,047
Biting? That's not fair!

190
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,186
Take it easy!

191
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,582
Fool. You should have learned.

192
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,520
I don't learn. One of my issues.

193
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,860
What the...

194
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,233
Quit smiling, you idiot.
You're supposed to be a professional.

195
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,034
You gotta be kidding me.

196
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,844
Hey!

197
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,931
I live for the simple things.

198
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,295
Like how much this is gonna hurt.

199
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,242
Yeah. Writhe, little man.

200
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:14,810
It'll grow back, you d'ast idiot.

201
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,447
Quit whining.

202
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:28,053
<i>Subject 89P13, drop your weapon.</i>

203
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,194
Crap.

204
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:31,795
By the authority of the Nova Corps,

205
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,694
- you are under arrest...
- All right. Come on up.

206
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,960
<i>... for endangerment to life</i>
<i>and the destruction of property.</i>

207
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,128
Hey! If it isn't Star-Prince.

208
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:42,501
- Star-Lord.
- Sorry. "Lord."

209
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,767
I picked this guy up a while back
for petty theft.

210
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,309
He's got a code name.

211
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,435
Yeah. Stay out of the way.

212
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,411
Come on, man. It's a...
It's an outlaw name.

213
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,209
Just relax, pal.

214
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,375
It's cool to have a code name.
It's not that weird.

215
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,477
Fascists.

216
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:13,331
<i>Ronan is destroying Xandarian</i>
<i>outposts throughout the galaxy.</i>

217
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:17,406
I should think that would call for some
slight response on the part of the Kree.

218
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,238
<i>We signed your peace treaty,</i>
<i>Nova Prime.</i>

219
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:20,504
<i>What more do you want?</i>

220
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,408
At least a statement
from the Kree Empire

221
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:24,709
saying that they condemn his actions.

222
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,316
He is slaughtering children.

223
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:28,820
Families.

224
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,285
<i>That is your business.</i>

225
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,381
<i>Now, I have other matters to attend to.</i>

226
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,827
Prick.

227
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,461
Well, some good news.

228
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:42,657
It looks like we've apprehended
one of Ronan's compatriots.

229
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:44,327
Gamora.

230
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,370
Surgically modified
and trained as a living weapon.

231
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:50,040
The adopted daughter
of the Mad Titan, Thanos.

232
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:53,569
Recently, Thanos lent her
and her sister Nebula out to Ronan,

233
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:56,942
which leads us to believe that Thanos
and Ronan are working together.

234
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:01,313
Subject 89P13. Calls itself "Rocket."

235
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,985
The result of illegal genetic

236
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,852
and cybernetic experiments
on a lower life form.

237
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,020
What the hell?

238
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,927
They call it "Groot."

239
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:12,596
A humanoid plant
that's been travelling recently

240
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:15,826
as 89P13's
personal houseplantlmuscle.

241
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,963
Peter Jason Quill, from Terra.

242
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:23,241
Raised from youth by a band
of mercenaries called the Ravagers,

243
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,171
led by Yondu Udonta.

244
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:26,776
I'm sorry.

245
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:29,845
I didn't know how this machine worked.

246
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:32,073
What a bunch of a-holes.

247
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,085
Transport all four to the Kyln.

248
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:41,288
I guess most of Nova Corps
wanna uphold the laws,

249
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:44,860
but these ones here,
they're corrupt and cruel.

250
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:47,222
But, hey, that's not my problem.

251
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:48,922
I ain't gonna be here long.

252
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:52,501
I've escaped 22 prisons.
This one's no different.

253
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,001
You're lucky the broad showed up,

254
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:55,266
because otherwise, me and Groot

255
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,205
would be collecting that bounty
right now,

256
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,174
and you'd be getting
drawn and quartered

257
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,345
by Yondu and those Ravagers.

258
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:02,572
I've had a lot of folks
try to kill me over the years.

259
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:05,479
I ain't about to be brought down
by a tree and a talking raccoon.

260
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:06,551
Hold.

261
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,549
- What's a raccoon?
- "What's a raccoon?"

262
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:09,948
It's what you are, stupid.

263
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,851
Ain't no thing like me, except me.

264
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,816
So, this Orb has
a real shiny blue suitcase,

265
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:18,953
Ark of the Covenant,
Maltese Falcon sort of vibe.

266
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:20,895
- What is it?
- I am Groot.

267
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,657
So what? What's the Orb?

268
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,961
I have no words for an honorless thief.

269
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,331
Pretty high and mighty
coming from the lackey

270
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:28,665
of a genocidal maniac.

271
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,639
Yeah, I know who you are.

272
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,710
Anyone who's anyone
knows who you are.

273
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,401
Yeah, we know who you are.

274
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:37,004
- Who is she?
- I am Groot.

275
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:39,015
Yeah, you said that.

276
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,219
I wasn't retrieving the Orb for Ronan.

277
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,013
I was betraying him.

278
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:46,190
I had an agreement
to sell it to a third party.

279
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,491
I am Groot.

280
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:53,926
Well, that's just as fascinating
as the first 89 times you told me that.

281
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:56,091
What is wrong with Giving Tree, here?

282
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:58,496
Well, he don't know
talking good like me and you.

283
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:02,664
So his vocabulistics is limited
to "l" and "am" and "Groot."

284
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,366
Exclusively in that order.

285
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,771
I tell you what,
that's gonna wear real thin, real fast.

286
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,340
Hey.

287
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:10,572
Put that away.

288
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,012
Hey!

289
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,348
Listen to me, you big blue bastard.
Take those headphones off.

290
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,146
That's mine. Those belong to impound.

291
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:19,152
That tape and that player is mine!

292
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,695
<i>Hooked on a Feeling,</i>
Blue Swede, 1973.

293
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,264
That song belongs to me!

294
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:49,945
- You first! You first!
- Murderer!

295
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,973
Coming for you first, Gamora!
You're dead!

296
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:57,282
You're scum! You're scum!

297
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,384
It's like I said,

298
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,424
she's got a rep.

299
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:05,393
A lot of prisoners here
have lost their families

300
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,656
to Ronan and his goons.

301
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:08,926
She'll last a day, tops.

302
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,294
Murderer!

303
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:11,860
The guards will protect her, right?

304
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:14,598
They're here to stop us from getting out.

305
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,671
They don't care
what we do to each other inside.

306
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:20,311
Whatever nightmares the future holds,

307
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:24,107
are dreams
compared to what's behind me.

308
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:27,980
Check out the new meat.

309
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:31,815
I'm gonna slather you up
in Gunavian jelly,

310
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:33,285
and go to town...

311
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:39,692
Let's make something clear.

312
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,925
This one here is our booty!

313
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,433
You wanna get to him,

314
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,767
you go through us!

315
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,940
Or, more accurately,

316
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,810
we go through you.

317
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:06,619
I'm with them.

318
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:09,818
I hate you.

319
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:13,153
No cell's gonna protect you for long.

320
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:26,901
You're dead!

321
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:28,479
Dead!

322
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:56,138
Take her down to the showers.

323
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:59,439
It'll be easier to clean up
the blood down there.

324
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:13,419
Quill, where you going?

325
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:15,782
Quill.

326
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:17,695
Quill!

327
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,131
Gamora, consider this a death sentence

328
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,460
for your crimes against the galaxy.

329
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:25,729
You dare?

330
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:33,774
You know who I am, yes?

331
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:35,773
You're Drax.

332
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,005
The Destroyer.

333
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,205
Quill!

334
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:41,182
And you know why they call me this.

335
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,911
You slayed dozens of Ronan's minions.

336
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:47,455
Ronan murdered my wife, Ovette,

337
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:49,926
and my daughter, Camaria.

338
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:52,491
He slaughtered them where they stood.

339
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:55,192
And he laughed!

340
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:56,333
Quill?

341
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:57,492
Her life

342
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,270
is not yours to take.

343
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:04,264
He killed my family.

344
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:06,135
I shall kill one of his in return.

345
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:09,606
Of course, Drax. Here, I...

346
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:17,852
Quill! What are you doing?

347
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:21,653
I'm no family to Ronan or Thanos.

348
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:32,963
I'm your only hope at stopping him.

349
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:37,600
Woman, your words
mean nothing to me!

350
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,243
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
- Crap.

351
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,606
You know, if killing Ronan
is truly your sole purpose,

352
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,011
I don't think this is
the best way to go about it.

353
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:47,742
Are you not the man
this wench attempted to kill?

354
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,146
Well, I mean,
she's hardly the first woman

355
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,254
to try and do that to me.

356
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:53,584
Look, this is from
a smoking-hot Rajak girl.

357
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,218
Stabbed me with a fork.

358
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:57,317
Didn't like me skipping out on her
at sunrise.

359
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:59,896
I got, right here, a Kree girl
tried to rip out my thorax.

360
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:02,123
She caught me with
this skinny little A'askavariian

361
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:03,257
who worked in Nova Records.

362
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:04,960
I was trying to get information.

363
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:06,764
You ever see an A'askavariian?

364
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:08,634
They have tentacles,
and needles for teeth.

365
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,035
If you think I'm seriously interested
in that, then...

366
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:14,568
You don't care. But here's the point.

367
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:19,112
She betrayed Ronan.
He's coming back for her.

368
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:20,910
And when he does,

369
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,350
that's when you...

370
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:26,949
Why would I put
my finger on his throat?

371
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:28,482
What?

372
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:31,786
No, it's a symbol.

373
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:36,094
This is a symbol
for you slicing his throat.

374
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,636
I would not slice his throat.

375
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:41,398
I would cut his head clean off.

376
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,597
It's a general expression
for you killing somebody.

377
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:45,332
You've heard of this.
You've seen this, right?

378
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:46,410
- You know what that is.
- Yeah. Yeah.

379
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:48,605
- Everyone knows.
- No, no.

380
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:53,717
What I'm saying is,
you want to keep her alive.

381
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:56,784
Don't do his work for him.

382
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,169
I like your knife. I'm keeping it.

383
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:15,397
- That was my favorite knife.
- <i>Listen!</i>

384
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:18,633
I could care less
whether you live or whether you die.

385
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:21,505
- Then why stop the big guy?
- Simple.

386
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:23,307
You know where to sell my Orb.

387
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:25,709
How are we gonna sell it
when we and it are still here?

388
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,009
My friend Rocket, here,

389
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,882
has escaped 22 prisons.

390
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,715
We're getting out.

391
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:34,690
And then we're headed straight
to Yondu to retrieve your bounty.

392
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:38,488
How much was your buyer
willing to pay you for my Orb?

393
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,058
Four billion units.

394
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:42,756
- What?
- Holy shit.

395
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:46,728
That Orb is my opportunity to
get away from Thanos and Ronan.

396
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:48,664
If you free us,

397
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,074
I'll lead you to the buyer directly

398
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:53,837
and I'll split the profit
between the three of us.

399
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:55,706
I am Groot.

400
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:57,181
Four of us.

401
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,373
Asleep for the danger,
awake for the money,

402
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:00,451
as per frickin' usual.

403
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,845
<i>You have been betrayed, Ronan.</i>

404
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,050
We know only that
she has been captured.

405
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,151
Gamora may yet recover the Orb.

406
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:14,595
<i>No! Our sources within the Kyln say</i>
<i>Gamora has her own plans for the Orb.</i>

407
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,290
<i>Look, your partnership with Thanos</i>

408
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,197
<i>is at risk.</i>

409
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:23,698
<i>Thanos requires your presence. Now!</i>

410
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:33,347
With all due respect, Thanos,
your daughter made this mess,

411
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,941
and yet you summon me.

412
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:36,953
I would lower my voice, Accuser.

413
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:39,114
First, she lost a battle
with some primitive.

414
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:40,986
Thanos put Gamora under your charge.

415
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:43,854
Then she was apprehended
by the Nova Corps.

416
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:45,859
You are the one here
with nothing to show for it.

417
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:50,060
Your sources say that she meant
to betray us the whole time!

418
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:51,396
Lower your tone!

419
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:52,569
I may be your...

420
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:04,680
I only ask that you take
this matter seriously.

421
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:09,513
The only matter
I do not take seriously, boy,

422
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:11,182
is you.

423
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:14,424
Your politics bore me.

424
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,685
Your demeanor is that of a pouty child.

425
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:22,459
And, apparently, you alienated
my favorite daughter, Gamora.

426
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,029
I shall honor our agreement, Kree,

427
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,902
if you bring me the Orb.

428
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,333
But return to me again empty-handed,

429
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:36,812
and I will bathe the starways
in your blood.

430
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,049
Thanks, Dad. Sounds fair.

431
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:47,085
This is one fight you won't win.

432
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:49,987
Let's head to the Kyln.

433
00:33:58,569 --> 00:33:59,729
If we're gonna get out of here,

434
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:01,566
we're gonna need to
get into that watchtower.

435
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,400
And to do that,
I'm gonna need a few things.

436
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,002
The guards wear security bands

437
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,576
to control their ins and outs. I need one.

438
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,411
Leave it to me.

439
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:13,413
That dude, there.
I need his prosthetic leg.

440
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,145
- His leg?
- Yeah.

441
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,378
God knows I don't need the rest of him.
Look at him, he's useless.

442
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:18,847
All right.

443
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:23,255
And finally, on the wall back there
is a black panel. Blinky yellow light.

444
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,429
- Do you see it?
- Yeah.

445
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:29,660
There's a quarnyx battery behind it.
Purplish box, green wires.

446
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,894
To get into that watchtower,
I definitely need it.

447
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,402
How are we supposed to do that?

448
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:35,768
Well, supposably,
these bald-bodies find you attractive.

449
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:37,500
So, maybe you can work out
some sort of trade.

450
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:38,734
You must be joking.

451
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:40,606
No, I really heard
they find you attractive.

452
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:42,303
Look, it's 20 feet up in the air,

453
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,813
and it's in the middle of the most
heavily-guarded part of the prison.

454
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,680
It's impossible to get up there
without being seen.

455
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:48,774
I got one plan,

456
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:50,979
and that plan requires
a frickin' quarnyx battery,

457
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,181
so figure it out!

458
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,525
Can I get back to it? Thanks.

459
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:57,491
Now, this is important.

460
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,187
Once the battery is removed,

461
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,663
everything is gonna slam
into emergency mode.

462
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,462
Once we have it, we gotta move quickly,

463
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:07,402
so you definitely need to get that last.

464
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:15,271
Or we could just get it first
and improvise.

465
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:17,404
- I'll get the armband.
- Leg.

466
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,527
<i>Prisoner,</i>

467
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:33,492
drop the device immediately
and retreat to your cell,

468
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:35,529
or we will open fire.

469
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:43,631
I am

470
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:46,503
Groot!

471
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,042
Fire!

472
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,956
All prisoners return
to your sleeping areas.

473
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,997
You idiot!

474
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:12,797
How am I supposed to fight
these things without my stuff?

475
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:20,543
The animal is in control.

476
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,745
Fire on my command!

477
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,565
Creepy little beast!

478
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:53,167
Oh, yeah.

479
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:06,952
You need my what?

480
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,630
- I'll need this.
- Good luck.

481
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:26,173
It's internally wired.

482
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:27,969
I'll figure something out.

483
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,107
Drop the leg!

484
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:35,777
Drop the leg
and move back to your cell!

485
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,032
Rocket!

486
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:57,204
Move to the watchtower!

487
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,228
You!

488
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:31,832
Man who has lain with an A'askavariian!

489
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:35,336
It was one time, man.

490
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:39,672
We need all available guards
in full combat gear...

491
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:03,539
Spare me your foul gaze, woman.

492
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:05,698
Why is this one here?

493
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,744
We promised him he could stay
by your side until he kills your boss.

494
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:10,174
I always keep my promises,

495
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,873
when they're
to muscle-bound whack-jobs

496
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,210
who will kill me if I don't. Here you go.

497
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:15,609
I was just kidding about the leg.

498
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:16,845
I just need these two things.

499
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,649
- What?
- No, I thought it'd be funny.

500
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:19,780
Was it funny?

501
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,651
Wait, what did he look like
hopping around?

502
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,659
I had to transfer him 30,000 units!

503
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:27,655
How are we going to leave?

504
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,267
Well, he's got a plan.

505
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,130
Right? Or is that
another thing you made up?

506
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:34,727
I have a plan! I have a plan!

507
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:36,463
Cease your yammering

508
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,164
and relieve us
from this irksome confinement.

509
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,707
Yeah, I'll have to agree
with the walking thesaurus

510
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,639
on that one.

511
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:44,180
Do not ever call me a thesaurus.

512
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:46,004
It's just a metaphor, dude.

513
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,084
His people are completely literal.
Metaphors are gonna go over his head.

514
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:50,778
Nothing goes over my head.

515
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:54,048
My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it.

516
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:58,525
I'm gonna die surrounded by
the biggest idiots in the galaxy.

517
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:06,064
Those are some big guns.

518
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,531
On my command!

519
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:10,474
Number one!

520
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:13,443
Rodent, we are ready for your plan.

521
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:15,339
Hold on!

522
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:18,176
Number two!

523
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:20,879
I recognize this animal.

524
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:23,215
We'd roast them over a flame pit
as children.

525
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,480
Their flesh was quite delicious.

526
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:25,814
Not helping!

527
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:26,990
Number three!

528
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:35,859
All fire on my command!

529
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,357
Three!

530
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:39,096
Two!

531
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:40,663
One!

532
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:56,815
He turned off the artificial gravity,

533
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:58,955
everywhere but in here.

534
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:39,560
I told you I had a plan.

535
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:03,514
That was a pretty good plan.

536
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:16,093
Yeah! There it is. Get my ship.

537
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,162
It's the <i>Milano,</i> the orange and blue one
over in the corner.

538
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,965
They crumpled my pants up into a ball.

539
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:23,139
That's rude! They folded yours.

540
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:33,382
The Orb's there. Let's go.

541
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:35,753
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

542
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:36,151
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

543
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:37,914
That bastard didn't put it back.

544
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:40,913
- Put what back?
- Here.

545
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:42,786
Get them to the ship. I will be right back.

546
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:45,487
- How are you gonna possibly...
- Just keep the <i>Milano</i> close by.

547
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:46,824
Go.

548
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:48,259
Go!

549
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:10,417
My neck!

550
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:16,353
Well, how's he gonna get to us?

551
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,794
He declined to share
that information with me.

552
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:19,863
Well, screw this, then!

553
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:22,791
I ain't waiting around
for some humie with a death wish.

554
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,162
You got the Orb, right?

555
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:25,926
Yes.

556
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:51,254
If we don't leave now,
we will be blown to bits.

557
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:52,362
No!

558
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,431
We're not leaving without the Orb.

559
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:04,369
Behold.

560
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:14,008
This one shows spirit.

561
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:16,951
He shall make a keen ally
in the battle against Ronan.

562
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,588
Companion, what were you retrieving?

563
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:27,286
You're an imbecile.

564
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:39,374
Yo, Ranger Rick! What are you doing?

565
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:42,067
You can't take apart my ship
without asking me!

566
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:44,110
- See, what is this?
- Don't touch that!

567
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:45,181
It's a bomb.

568
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:46,249
- A bomb?
- Yup.

569
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,042
And you leave it lying around?

570
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:49,742
I was gonna put it in a box.

571
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:50,942
What's a box gonna do?

572
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:53,248
- How about this one?
- No! Hey!

573
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:54,446
- Leave it alone.
- Why? What is it?

574
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:56,025
- Shut up.
- Hey!

575
00:44:57,327 --> 00:44:58,316
What is that?

576
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,225
That's for if things get really hardcore.

577
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:02,960
Or if you wanna blow up moons.

578
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:04,500
No one's blowing up moons.

579
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,761
You just wanna suck the joy
out of everything.

580
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,995
So, listen, I'm gonna need
your buyer's coordinates.

581
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:12,370
We're heading in the right direction.
For now.

582
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:14,910
If we're gonna work together,
you might try trusting me a little bit.

583
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:16,511
And how much do you trust me?

584
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,649
I'd trust you a lot more
if you told me what this was.

585
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:23,484
Because I'm guessing
it's some kind of weapon.

586
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:24,984
I don't know what it is.

587
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:27,319
If it's a weapon,
we should use it against Ronan.

588
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:29,424
Put it down, you fool.
You'll destroy us all.

589
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,527
Or just you, murderess!

590
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,286
I let you live once, princess!

591
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:34,487
- I am not a princess!
- Hey!

592
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:38,225
Nobody is killing anybody on my ship!

593
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:42,460
We're stuck together
until we get the money.

594
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:44,766
I have no interest in money.

595
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:46,169
Great.

596
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:50,571
That means more money
for the three of us.

597
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:54,944
For the four of us.

598
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:56,445
Partners.

599
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:58,111
We have an agreement,

600
00:45:58,222 --> 00:45:59,746
but I would never be partners
with the likes of you.

601
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:02,318
I'll tell the buyer we're on our way.

602
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:06,657
And Quill, your ship is filthy.

603
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:12,825
She has no idea.

604
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,438
If I had a black light,

605
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:18,007
the place would look like
a Jackson Pollock painting.

606
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:20,336
You got issues, Quill.

607
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:31,679
I swear. I don't know where they went!
I swear.

608
00:46:32,756 --> 00:46:35,156
If he knew where they were headed,
he would have already told us.

609
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:36,226
Yeah.

610
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:37,761
Ronan,

611
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:41,021
the Nova Corps sent a fleet
to defend the prison.

612
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,098
Well, then,

613
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:45,462
send Necrocraft
to every corner of the quadrant.

614
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:49,036
Find the Orb. Any means, any price.

615
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:50,570
And this place?

616
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:52,241
The Nova can't know what we're after.

617
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:55,642
Cleanse it!

618
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:00,517
Do you got any other
cute little buggers like this one?

619
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:04,679
I like to stick 'em all in a row
on my control console.

620
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:07,157
I can't tell if you're joking or not.

621
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:09,416
He's being fully serious.

622
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:11,821
In that case, I can show you...

623
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:14,795
But first, you gonna tell me
what this Orb is,

624
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:17,059
and why everybody cares
so damn much about it.

625
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:19,396
And then you gonna tell me,

626
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:21,628
who out there might wanna buy it.

627
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,501
Sir, the high-end community is a...

628
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:28,843
The high-end community is a...

629
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:30,978
It's a tight-knit...

630
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,341
Tight-knit...

631
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:34,244
The high-end community
is a very tight-knit...

632
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,884
I cannot possibly betray

633
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:39,115
the confidentiality of my buyers!

634
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:52,666
Now, who again is this buyer of yours?

635
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,739
Carina.

636
00:47:57,841 --> 00:47:58,967
Yes, Master.

637
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:02,045
Your people do have elbows,
do they not?

638
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:03,944
We do, Master.

639
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:07,082
Then use them.

640
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:09,783
I don't have to remind you

641
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,912
what happened to the last attendant
who disappointed me.

642
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:14,889
Do I?

643
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:21,726
Chop, chop.
Our guests will be here soon.

644
00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:28,095
Heads up! We're inbound.

645
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:48,513
What is it?

646
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,561
<i>It's called Knowhere.</i>

647
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:54,563
<i>The severed head</i>
<i>of an ancient celestial being.</i>

648
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:56,795
Be wary headed in, rodent.

649
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:01,129
There are no regulations
whatsoever here.

650
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:28,362
Hundreds of years ago,
the Tivan Group sent workers in

651
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:31,025
to mine the organic matter
within the skull.

652
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,329
Bone, brain tissue, spinal fluid.

653
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:38,338
All rare resources, highly valued
in black markets across the galaxy.

654
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:42,269
It's dangerous and illegal work,
suitable only for outlaws.

655
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,174
Well, I come from a planet of outlaws.

656
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:45,907
Billy the Kid,

657
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:48,050
Bonnie and Clyde, John Stamos.

658
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:49,741
It sounds like a place,
which I would like to visit.

659
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:50,842
Yeah, you should.

660
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,346
Excuse me.

661
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:55,789
- Watch your wallets.
- Can you spare any units?

662
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:04,858
Get out of here.

663
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:12,064
Your buyer's in there?

664
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:14,373
We are to wait here
for his representative.

665
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:15,977
Get out of here!

666
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,306
This is no respectable establishment.

667
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,540
What do you expect us to do
while we wait?

668
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,444
Yes! Yes!

669
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:33,895
Yahoo!

670
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:42,633
My Orloni has won,

671
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:44,602
as I won at all things!

672
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:47,936
Now, let's put more of this liquid
into our bodies.

673
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:52,013
That's the first thing you said
that wasn't bat-shit crazy!

674
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:55,481
Man, you wouldn't believe
what they charge for fuel out here.

675
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:57,814
I might actually lose money on this job.

676
00:50:58,021 --> 00:50:59,613
My connection is making us wait.

677
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:04,093
It's just a negotiation tactic.
Trust me, this is my specialty.

678
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:06,125
Where yours is more,

679
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:09,126
"Stab, stab. Those are my terms."

680
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,833
My father didn't stress diplomacy.

681
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:13,059
Thanos?

682
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:16,168
He's not my father.

683
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:18,804
When Thanos took my home world,

684
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:21,239
he killed my parents in front of me.

685
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:23,644
He tortured me,

686
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:26,247
turned me into a weapon.

687
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:30,719
When he said he was going to destroy
an entire planet for Ronan,

688
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,855
I couldn't stand by and...

689
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:39,728
Why would you risk your life for this?

690
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:43,389
My mother gave it to me.

691
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:48,199
My mom liked sharing with me all the
pop songs that she loved growing up.

692
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:49,272
I happened to have it on me,

693
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,604
when I was...

694
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:54,172
The day that she...

695
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,342
You know, when I left Earth.

696
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,476
What do you do with it?

697
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:04,313
Do? Nothing. You listen to it.
Or you can dance.

698
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:09,083
I'm a warrior and an assassin.
I do not dance.

699
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,452
Really?

700
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:14,756
On my planet,
there's a legend about people like you.

701
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,227
It's called

702
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,794
<i>Footloose.</i>

703
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:21,960
And in it, a great hero

704
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:23,400
named Kevin Bacon,

705
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:29,005
teaches an entire city full of people with
sticks up their butts that dancing, well...

706
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:32,112
It's the greatest thing there is.

707
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:34,540
Who put the sticks up their butts?

708
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:36,116
What? No, that's just a...

709
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,082
- That is cruel.
- It's just a phrase

710
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:40,449
people use.

711
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,170
The melody is pleasant!

712
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:20,422
- No!
- What the hell?

713
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:21,927
I know who you are, Peter Quill!

714
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:25,295
And I am not some starry-eyed waif
here to succumb to your...

715
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,628
Your pelvic sorcery!

716
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:29,202
That is not what is happening here.

717
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:36,142
No.

718
00:53:45,422 --> 00:53:46,719
Stop it!

719
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:48,124
What are you doing?

720
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:51,618
This vermin speaks of affairs
he knows nothing about!

721
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:53,693
- That is true!
- He has no respect!

722
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,195
- That is also true!
- Hold on! Hold on!

723
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,390
Keep calling me vermin, tough guy!

724
00:53:58,668 --> 00:54:00,636
You just wanna laugh at me
like everyone else!

725
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:03,328
Rocket, you're drunk. All right?
No one's laughing at you.

726
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,202
He thinks I'm some stupid thing!
He does!

727
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,400
Well, I didn't ask to get made!

728
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,880
I didn't ask to be torn apart,

729
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,981
and put back together, over and over

730
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:15,242
and turned into some...

731
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:16,519
Some little monster!

732
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,585
Rocket, no one's calling you a monster.

733
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:20,847
He called me "vermin"!

734
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:23,617
She called me "rodent"!

735
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:25,158
Let's see if you can laugh

736
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:28,288
after five or six good shots
to your frickin' face!

737
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:29,863
No, no, no, no!

738
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:32,193
Four billion units! Rocket!

739
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:33,369
Come on, man. Hey!

740
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:34,437
Suck it up for one more lousy night

741
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:36,196
and you're rich.

742
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:46,075
Fine.

743
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,015
But I can't promise, when all this is over

744
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:49,776
I'm not gonna kill
every last one of you jerks.

745
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:53,444
See? That's exactly why
none of you have any friends!

746
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:56,718
Five seconds after you meet somebody,
you're already trying to kill them!

747
00:54:56,826 --> 00:55:00,728
We have travelled,
halfway across the quadrant.

748
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:02,898
And Ronan is no closer to being dead.

749
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:07,326
- Drax!
- Let him go.

750
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:08,697
We don't need him.

751
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,139
Milady Gamora.

752
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:15,106
I'm here to fetch you for my master.

753
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,351
Okay, this isn't creepy at all.

754
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:26,651
We house the galaxy's
largest collection

755
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,790
of fauna, relics,
and species of all manner.

756
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,659
I present to you,

757
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:41,796
Taneleer Tivan, The Collector.

758
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:57,745
Oh, my dear Gamora.

759
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:00,954
How wonderful to meet in the flesh.

760
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,682
Let's bypass the formalities, Tivan.

761
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:06,628
We have what we discussed.

762
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:12,126
What is that thing there?

763
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:13,996
I am Groot.

764
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:19,733
I never thought I'd meet a Groot.

765
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:21,342
Sir...

766
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:25,309
You must allow me to pay you now
so that I may own your carcass.

767
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:28,348
At the moment of your death, of course.

768
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:29,745
I am Groot.

769
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:32,649
Why, so he could turn you
into a frickin' chair?

770
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:33,789
That's your pet?

771
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:36,750
- His what?
- Tivan.

772
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:41,125
We have been halfway
around the galaxy, retrieving this Orb.

773
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:43,322
Very well, then.

774
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:46,001
Let us see what you brought.

775
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:02,403
Three quarnyx batteries,
seven cases of Cotati seeds.

776
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:05,909
No, cases. Last time, you sent me...

777
00:57:07,548 --> 00:57:10,449
You shall send a message for me.

778
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:12,318
Oh, my new friends.

779
00:57:13,687 --> 00:57:16,781
Before creation itself,

780
00:57:16,991 --> 00:57:18,652
there were six singularities.

781
00:57:20,961 --> 00:57:24,624
Then the universe exploded
into existence,

782
00:57:24,832 --> 00:57:26,823
and the remnants of these systems

783
00:57:27,034 --> 00:57:30,435
were forged into concentrated ingots.

784
00:57:31,205 --> 00:57:33,469
Infinity Stones.

785
00:57:34,675 --> 00:57:36,108
These stones, it seems,

786
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:38,073
can only be brandished

787
00:57:38,279 --> 00:57:41,715
by beings of extraordinary strength.

788
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:42,905
Observe.

789
00:57:46,187 --> 00:57:51,989
These carriers can use the Stone
to mow down entire civilizations

790
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:55,551
like wheat in a field.

791
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:59,328
There's a little pee
coming out of me right now.

792
00:58:00,167 --> 00:58:01,361
Once, for a moment,

793
00:58:01,569 --> 00:58:05,562
a group was able to share
the energy amongst themselves,

794
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:08,708
but even they
were quickly destroyed by it.

795
00:58:14,915 --> 00:58:16,576
Beautiful.

796
00:58:18,419 --> 00:58:20,853
Beyond compare.

797
00:58:23,057 --> 00:58:26,686
We're all very fascinated, whitey.
But we'd like to get paid.

798
00:58:28,629 --> 00:58:29,994
How would you like to get paid?

799
00:58:30,197 --> 00:58:32,188
What do you think, fancy man? Units!

800
00:58:33,667 --> 00:58:34,725
Very well, then.

801
00:58:40,374 --> 00:58:41,705
Carina.

802
00:58:42,076 --> 00:58:43,043
Stand back.

803
00:58:43,711 --> 00:58:46,305
I will no longer be your slave!

804
00:58:46,514 --> 00:58:47,947
No!

805
00:59:35,296 --> 00:59:36,320
What the...

806
00:59:46,307 --> 00:59:48,605
How could I think Tivan could contain
whatever was within the Orb?

807
00:59:48,709 --> 00:59:50,768
What do you still have it for?

808
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:52,209
What are we gonna do,
leave it in there?

809
00:59:52,313 --> 00:59:54,178
I can't believe you had that
in your purse!

810
00:59:54,949 --> 00:59:56,075
It's not a purse, it's a knapsack!

811
00:59:56,283 --> 00:59:57,944
We have to bring this
to the Nova Corps.

812
00:59:58,552 --> 00:59:59,951
There's a chance they can contain it.

813
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:01,021
Are you kidding me?

814
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:04,020
We're wanted by the Nova Corps.
Just give it to Ronan!

815
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:05,385
So he can destroy the galaxy?

816
01:00:05,593 --> 01:00:07,390
What are you,
some saint all of a sudden?

817
01:00:07,494 --> 01:00:10,486
What has the galaxy ever done for you?
Why would you wanna save it?

818
01:00:10,598 --> 01:00:12,395
Because I'm one of the idiots
who lives in it!

819
01:00:12,499 --> 01:00:13,932
Peter, listen to me.

820
01:00:14,034 --> 01:00:17,162
We cannot allow the Stone
to fall into Ronan's hands.

821
01:00:17,371 --> 01:00:18,895
We have to go back to your ship,

822
01:00:19,106 --> 01:00:20,596
and deliver it to Nova.

823
01:00:20,808 --> 01:00:23,140
Right, right, okay. I think you're right.

824
01:00:23,978 --> 01:00:27,846
Or we could give it to somebody
who's not going to arrest us,

825
01:00:28,048 --> 01:00:29,276
who's really nice

826
01:00:29,483 --> 01:00:31,110
for a whole lot of money.

827
01:00:31,318 --> 01:00:33,752
I think it's a really good balance
between both of your points of view.

828
01:00:33,954 --> 01:00:34,943
You're despicable.

829
01:00:35,656 --> 01:00:36,623
Dishonorable.

830
01:00:37,291 --> 01:00:38,258
Faithless!

831
01:00:39,026 --> 01:00:40,516
- No.
- At last!

832
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:45,565
I shall meet my foe and destroy him.

833
01:00:45,766 --> 01:00:47,427
You called Ronan?

834
01:00:52,339 --> 01:00:55,331
Quill! Don't you move, boy!

835
01:00:56,543 --> 01:00:58,602
Don't you move! Get out of the way!

836
01:01:02,583 --> 01:01:04,983
Ronan the Accuser!

837
01:01:05,085 --> 01:01:07,610
You are the one
who transmitted the message?

838
01:01:07,721 --> 01:01:08,983
You killed my wife.

839
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:11,720
You killed my daughter!

840
01:01:19,266 --> 01:01:23,032
I told you, you can't fit.
Now, wait here. I'll be back.

841
01:01:28,709 --> 01:01:32,008
It is Gamora.
She is escaping with the Orb.

842
01:01:40,821 --> 01:01:42,413
No!

843
01:01:42,589 --> 01:01:43,556
Nebula,

844
01:01:44,425 --> 01:01:46,017
retrieve the Orb.

845
01:02:02,576 --> 01:02:04,441
The Stone is in the furthest pod.

846
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:06,407
Bring it down!

847
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:38,136
Rocket, keep them off Gamora
until she gets to the <i>Milano.</i>

848
01:02:38,345 --> 01:02:40,677
How? We've got
no weaponry on these things.

849
01:02:40,881 --> 01:02:42,610
These pods are industrial grade.

850
01:02:42,816 --> 01:02:43,908
<i>They're nearly indestructible.</i>

851
01:02:44,118 --> 01:02:46,279
Not against necroblasts, they're not.

852
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:48,344
That's not what I'm saying.

853
01:03:36,904 --> 01:03:38,531
Let me borrow your ride.

854
01:04:11,371 --> 01:04:13,134
I don't recall killing your family.

855
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:19,844
I doubt I'll remember killing you, either.

856
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:39,295
Quill, I'm trapped.
I can't make it to the <i>Milano.</i>

857
01:04:39,967 --> 01:04:40,934
I have to head out.

858
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:45,404
Wait! These things
aren't meant to go out there.

859
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:54,310
You are a disappointment, sister.

860
01:04:55,148 --> 01:04:57,048
Of all our siblings,

861
01:04:57,918 --> 01:04:59,351
I hated you least.

862
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,080
<i>Nebula, please.</i>

863
01:05:01,288 --> 01:05:02,846
If Ronan gets this stone

864
01:05:03,323 --> 01:05:05,018
- <i>he'll kill us all.</i>
- Not all.

865
01:05:06,793 --> 01:05:08,420
You will already be dead.

866
01:06:02,983 --> 01:06:05,918
<i>Ronan, it is done.</i>

867
01:06:09,022 --> 01:06:10,011
<i>Quill, come on.</i>

868
01:06:10,624 --> 01:06:13,058
<i>Her body mods should keep her alive</i>
<i>a couple more minutes,</i>

869
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,228
<i>but there's nothing we can do for her.</i>

870
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:16,896
<i>These pods</i>
<i>aren't meant to be out here.</i>

871
01:06:17,097 --> 01:06:19,463
<i>In a second, we're gonna be</i>
<i>in the same boat.</i>

872
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:29,270
Damn it.

873
01:06:30,644 --> 01:06:32,043
<i>Quill?</i>

874
01:06:32,245 --> 01:06:33,974
Yondu! Yondu.

875
01:06:34,381 --> 01:06:35,405
<i>This is Quill!</i>

876
01:06:35,515 --> 01:06:39,007
- <i>My coordinates are 227 K324.</i>
- <i>Quill.</i>

877
01:06:39,286 --> 01:06:40,412
Quill, what are you doing?

878
01:06:40,621 --> 01:06:42,020
Just outside Knowhere.

879
01:06:42,222 --> 01:06:44,315
If you're there, come get me.

880
01:06:45,058 --> 01:06:46,525
I'm all yours.

881
01:06:56,003 --> 01:06:57,937
<i>Quill, don't be ridiculous.</i>

882
01:06:59,573 --> 01:07:01,632
<i>Get back into your pod!</i>

883
01:07:02,075 --> 01:07:05,101
<i>You can't fit two people in there.</i>
<i>You're gonna die.</i>

884
01:07:06,346 --> 01:07:08,177
You'll die in seconds!

885
01:07:08,548 --> 01:07:09,640
Quill.

886
01:08:10,744 --> 01:08:12,405
Quill?

887
01:08:14,081 --> 01:08:15,514
What happened?

888
01:08:16,717 --> 01:08:18,708
I saw you out there.

889
01:08:20,187 --> 01:08:22,621
I don't know what came over me.

890
01:08:23,623 --> 01:08:25,386
But I couldn't let you die.

891
01:08:28,261 --> 01:08:30,661
I found something inside of myself.

892
01:08:31,732 --> 01:08:33,256
Something

893
01:08:33,467 --> 01:08:35,367
incredibly heroic.

894
01:08:37,170 --> 01:08:39,661
I mean, not to brag,

895
01:08:39,873 --> 01:08:41,101
but, objectively...

896
01:08:41,241 --> 01:08:42,230
Where's the Orb?

897
01:08:44,144 --> 01:08:46,339
It's... Well, they got the Orb.

898
01:08:46,546 --> 01:08:47,535
What?

899
01:08:50,317 --> 01:08:52,717
Welcome home, Peter.

900
01:09:15,642 --> 01:09:18,372
Blasted idiot. They're all idiots!

901
01:09:19,746 --> 01:09:21,941
Quill just got himself captured.

902
01:09:22,149 --> 01:09:26,415
None of this ever would have happened
if you didn't try to single-handedly

903
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:27,814
take on a frickin' army!

904
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:30,783
You're right.

905
01:09:33,527 --> 01:09:35,586
I was a fool.

906
01:09:38,098 --> 01:09:39,759
All the anger,

907
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:42,264
all the rage,

908
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:47,736
was just to cover my loss.

909
01:09:56,383 --> 01:09:58,681
"My wife and child are dead."

910
01:10:00,253 --> 01:10:02,414
I don't care if it's mean!

911
01:10:02,622 --> 01:10:04,453
Everybody's got dead people.

912
01:10:05,158 --> 01:10:06,785
It's no excuse to get everybody else

913
01:10:06,993 --> 01:10:08,858
dead along the way!

914
01:10:12,732 --> 01:10:15,360
Come on, Groot. Ronan has the Stone.

915
01:10:15,569 --> 01:10:18,766
The only chance we got is
to get to the other side of the universe

916
01:10:18,872 --> 01:10:20,737
as fast as we can and maybe,

917
01:10:20,941 --> 01:10:25,537
just maybe, we'll be able to live full lives
before that whack-job ever gets there.

918
01:10:28,048 --> 01:10:29,345
I am Groot.

919
01:10:29,549 --> 01:10:31,813
Save them? How?

920
01:10:32,018 --> 01:10:34,748
I am Groot.

921
01:10:34,955 --> 01:10:37,583
I know they're the only friends
that we ever had,

922
01:10:37,691 --> 01:10:40,387
but there's an army
of Ravagers around them.

923
01:10:40,594 --> 01:10:42,152
And there's only two of us!

924
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:44,458
Three.

925
01:10:53,573 --> 01:10:55,768
You're making me

926
01:10:55,976 --> 01:10:57,500
beat... up

927
01:10:57,711 --> 01:10:58,678
grass!

928
01:11:01,248 --> 01:11:02,943
The Orb is in my possession,

929
01:11:04,084 --> 01:11:05,551
as I promised.

930
01:11:05,752 --> 01:11:07,276
<i>Bring it to me.</i>

931
01:11:07,487 --> 01:11:10,752
Yes, that was our agreement.

932
01:11:11,524 --> 01:11:13,151
Bring you the Orb,

933
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:16,852
and you will destroy Xandar for me.

934
01:11:17,063 --> 01:11:21,557
However, now that I know
it contains an Infinity Stone,

935
01:11:21,768 --> 01:11:23,759
I wonder what use I have for you.

936
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:25,403
<i>Boy,</i>

937
01:11:25,805 --> 01:11:28,171
<i>I would reconsider your current course.</i>

938
01:11:29,376 --> 01:11:31,606
Master! You cannot!

939
01:11:31,811 --> 01:11:34,279
Thanos is the most powerful being
in the universe.

940
01:11:34,915 --> 01:11:36,542
Not anymore.

941
01:11:59,406 --> 01:12:01,636
You call me "boy!"

942
01:12:01,841 --> 01:12:06,335
I will unfurl 1,000 years of Kree justice
on Xandar,

943
01:12:06,546 --> 01:12:10,004
and burn it to its core!

944
01:12:10,216 --> 01:12:12,116
Then, Thanos,

945
01:12:12,319 --> 01:12:14,253
I am coming for you.

946
01:12:16,656 --> 01:12:19,557
After Xandar,
you are going to kill my father?

947
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:21,857
You dare to oppose me?

948
01:12:22,062 --> 01:12:23,859
You see what he has turned me into.

949
01:12:23,964 --> 01:12:28,196
If you kill him, I will help you
destroy a thousand planets.

950
01:12:29,002 --> 01:12:30,469
<i>You betray me?</i>

951
01:12:31,438 --> 01:12:32,405
Steal my money?

952
01:12:32,572 --> 01:12:34,130
Stop it! Leave him alone!

953
01:12:34,574 --> 01:12:36,599
When I picked you up as a kid,

954
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:39,108
these boys wanted to eat you.

955
01:12:39,312 --> 01:12:41,712
They ain't never tasted Terran before.

956
01:12:41,915 --> 01:12:43,576
I saved your life!

957
01:12:43,683 --> 01:12:45,810
Will you shut up about that? God!

958
01:12:46,019 --> 01:12:48,317
Twenty years, you been
throwing that in my face,

959
01:12:48,421 --> 01:12:51,117
like it's some great thing, not eating me.

960
01:12:51,224 --> 01:12:54,751
Normal people don't even think
about eating someone else!

961
01:12:54,961 --> 01:12:57,395
Much less that person
having to be grateful for it!

962
01:12:57,597 --> 01:12:58,655
You abducted me, man.

963
01:12:59,733 --> 01:13:01,928
You stole me from my home
and from my family.

964
01:13:02,135 --> 01:13:04,228
You don't give a damn
about your Terra!

965
01:13:04,771 --> 01:13:05,738
You're scared

966
01:13:05,939 --> 01:13:08,032
because you're soft in here.

967
01:13:08,141 --> 01:13:09,165
Here, right here!

968
01:13:09,576 --> 01:13:10,543
Yondu!

969
01:13:10,744 --> 01:13:11,938
Listen to me.

970
01:13:12,045 --> 01:13:14,275
Ronan has something
called an Infinity Stone.

971
01:13:14,381 --> 01:13:16,212
I know what he's got, girl.

972
01:13:16,416 --> 01:13:18,646
Then you know we must get it back!

973
01:13:18,852 --> 01:13:22,219
He's gonna use it to wipe out Xandar.

974
01:13:22,422 --> 01:13:25,414
We have to warn them.
Billions of people will perish.

975
01:13:25,525 --> 01:13:28,153
Is that what she's been
filling your head with, boy?

976
01:13:28,261 --> 01:13:29,228
Sentiment?

977
01:13:30,764 --> 01:13:32,527
Eating away your brain like maggots!

978
01:13:37,337 --> 01:13:38,702
That's it.

979
01:13:39,406 --> 01:13:40,430
No!

980
01:13:40,907 --> 01:13:41,965
Sorry, boy.

981
01:13:42,175 --> 01:13:45,633
But a captain's gotta teach his men
what happens to those what cross him.

982
01:13:45,845 --> 01:13:47,073
Captain's gotta teach stuff!

983
01:13:49,949 --> 01:13:52,144
If you kill me now,

984
01:13:52,352 --> 01:13:56,379
you are saying goodbye to
the biggest score you have ever seen.

985
01:14:01,594 --> 01:14:02,993
The Stone?

986
01:14:03,797 --> 01:14:05,697
I hope you got something
better than that.

987
01:14:05,899 --> 01:14:08,493
Because ain't nobody stealing
from Ronan.

988
01:14:09,736 --> 01:14:10,998
We got a ringer.

989
01:14:11,204 --> 01:14:12,603
Is that right?

990
01:14:13,773 --> 01:14:16,105
She knows everything
there is to know about Ronan.

991
01:14:16,309 --> 01:14:17,503
His ships,

992
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:19,200
his army.

993
01:14:19,412 --> 01:14:21,209
He's vulnerable.

994
01:14:22,048 --> 01:14:23,345
Hey, what do you say, Yondu?

995
01:14:23,450 --> 01:14:26,977
Me and you, taking down a mark
side-by-side, like the old days.

996
01:14:34,727 --> 01:14:35,751
Let him go!

997
01:14:37,530 --> 01:14:40,021
You always did have a scrote, boy!

998
01:14:40,233 --> 01:14:42,929
That's why I kept you on as a young'un.

999
01:14:51,244 --> 01:14:53,178
Captain, the shot was non-damaging.

1000
01:14:53,379 --> 01:14:55,540
<i>Attention, idiots.</i>

1001
01:14:57,684 --> 01:15:01,415
<i>The lunatic on top of this craft</i>
<i>is holding a Hadron Enforcer.</i>

1002
01:15:01,621 --> 01:15:03,282
It's a weapon of my own design.

1003
01:15:03,490 --> 01:15:04,582
What the hell?

1004
01:15:05,091 --> 01:15:07,719
<i>If you don't hand over</i>
<i>our companions now,</i>

1005
01:15:07,961 --> 01:15:10,225
<i>he's gonna tear your ship a new one.</i>

1006
01:15:10,430 --> 01:15:12,159
<i>A very big new one!</i>

1007
01:15:12,365 --> 01:15:15,163
- I ain't buyin' it.
- I'm giving you to the count of five.

1008
01:15:15,735 --> 01:15:18,795
- <i>5, 4, 3...</i>
- No! Wait, hold on!

1009
01:15:19,005 --> 01:15:20,734
Rocket, it's me, for God sakes!

1010
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:22,908
We figured it out! We're fine!

1011
01:15:23,109 --> 01:15:24,269
<i>Hey, Quill. What's going on?</i>

1012
01:15:26,212 --> 01:15:27,839
You call that "figured it out"?

1013
01:15:27,947 --> 01:15:30,211
We're gonna rob the guys
who just beat us senseless.

1014
01:15:30,416 --> 01:15:31,849
You want to talk about senseless?

1015
01:15:31,951 --> 01:15:34,215
How about trying to save us
by blowing us up?

1016
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:37,153
We were only gonna blow you up
if they didn't turn you over!

1017
01:15:37,257 --> 01:15:39,020
And how on earth
were they gonna turn us over

1018
01:15:39,225 --> 01:15:40,351
when you only gave them
a count of five?

1019
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:43,192
We didn't have time
to work out the minutiae

1020
01:15:43,396 --> 01:15:44,363
of the plan.

1021
01:15:44,464 --> 01:15:46,728
This is what we get
for acting altruistically.

1022
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:48,892
- I am Groot.
- They are ungrateful.

1023
01:15:49,102 --> 01:15:50,194
What's important now

1024
01:15:50,403 --> 01:15:51,961
is we get the Ravagers' army

1025
01:15:52,172 --> 01:15:53,366
to help us save Xandar.

1026
01:15:53,473 --> 01:15:54,906
So we can give the Stone to Yondu

1027
01:15:55,008 --> 01:15:56,566
who's just gonna sell
to somebody even worse?

1028
01:15:57,143 --> 01:15:58,303
We'll figure that part out later.

1029
01:15:58,511 --> 01:16:00,206
We have to stop Ronan.

1030
01:16:00,313 --> 01:16:01,748
How?

1031
01:16:01,881 --> 01:16:02,939
I have a plan.

1032
01:16:03,082 --> 01:16:04,049
You've got a plan?

1033
01:16:04,551 --> 01:16:05,518
Yes.

1034
01:16:06,119 --> 01:16:07,143
First of all, you're copying me from

1035
01:16:07,287 --> 01:16:08,652
- when I said I had a plan.
- No, I'm not.

1036
01:16:08,855 --> 01:16:11,756
People say that all the time.
It's not that unique of a thing to say.

1037
01:16:11,858 --> 01:16:13,450
Secondly, I don't even
believe you have a plan.

1038
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:16,556
I have part of a plan!

1039
01:16:16,763 --> 01:16:18,196
What percentage of a plan
do you have?

1040
01:16:18,398 --> 01:16:19,831
You don't get to ask questions

1041
01:16:19,933 --> 01:16:21,127
after the nonsense
you pulled on Knowhere.

1042
01:16:21,701 --> 01:16:23,293
I just saved Quill.

1043
01:16:23,436 --> 01:16:24,403
We've already established

1044
01:16:24,504 --> 01:16:26,165
that you destroying the ship
that I'm on is not saving me.

1045
01:16:26,272 --> 01:16:28,365
- When did we establish it?
- Like three seconds ago!

1046
01:16:28,608 --> 01:16:30,132
I wasn't listening.
I was thinking of something else.

1047
01:16:31,277 --> 01:16:32,301
She's right. You don't get an opinion.

1048
01:16:33,179 --> 01:16:34,237
What percentage?

1049
01:16:34,447 --> 01:16:35,744
I don't know. Twelve percent.

1050
01:16:35,848 --> 01:16:37,179
Twelve percent?

1051
01:16:39,219 --> 01:16:40,311
That's a fake laugh.

1052
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,249
- It's real!
- Totally fake.

1053
01:16:42,355 --> 01:16:46,917
That is the most real, authentic,
hysterical laugh of my entire life

1054
01:16:47,126 --> 01:16:48,093
because that is not a plan.

1055
01:16:48,261 --> 01:16:49,660
It's barely a concept.

1056
01:16:49,862 --> 01:16:50,829
You're taking their side?

1057
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:52,156
I am Groot.

1058
01:16:52,365 --> 01:16:53,730
So what, it's better than 11%?

1059
01:16:53,833 --> 01:16:55,300
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

1060
01:16:55,401 --> 01:16:57,562
Thank you, Groot. Thank you.

1061
01:16:58,137 --> 01:17:01,538
See? Groot's the only one of you
who has a clue.

1062
01:17:06,613 --> 01:17:07,602
Guys.

1063
01:17:08,481 --> 01:17:09,505
Come on.

1064
01:17:09,716 --> 01:17:11,707
Yondu is gonna be here in two seconds.

1065
01:17:11,818 --> 01:17:14,286
He expects to hear this big plan of ours.

1066
01:17:15,688 --> 01:17:17,553
I need your help.

1067
01:17:19,325 --> 01:17:21,623
I look around at us.

1068
01:17:22,161 --> 01:17:23,150
You know what I see?

1069
01:17:24,163 --> 01:17:25,130
Losers.

1070
01:17:27,834 --> 01:17:29,324
I mean, like,

1071
01:17:29,535 --> 01:17:31,469
folks who have lost stuff.

1072
01:17:31,571 --> 01:17:33,698
And we have. Man, we have. All of us.

1073
01:17:34,874 --> 01:17:36,136
Our homes,

1074
01:17:36,909 --> 01:17:38,240
our families,

1075
01:17:39,412 --> 01:17:41,277
normal lives.

1076
01:17:41,481 --> 01:17:44,177
And, usually, life takes more
than it gives. But not today.

1077
01:17:45,051 --> 01:17:46,541
Today, it's given us something.

1078
01:17:46,753 --> 01:17:48,243
It has given us a chance.

1079
01:17:48,454 --> 01:17:49,751
To do what?

1080
01:17:51,691 --> 01:17:52,953
To give a shit.

1081
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:55,557
For once.

1082
01:17:55,762 --> 01:17:57,730
Not run away.

1083
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,091
I, for one, am not gonna
stand by and watch

1084
01:18:03,202 --> 01:18:06,228
as Ronan wipes out
billions of innocent lives.

1085
01:18:07,373 --> 01:18:09,933
But, Quill, stopping Ronan,

1086
01:18:11,077 --> 01:18:13,068
it's impossible.

1087
01:18:13,613 --> 01:18:15,877
You're asking us to die.

1088
01:18:22,588 --> 01:18:24,419
Yeah, I guess I am.

1089
01:18:37,303 --> 01:18:38,395
Quill.

1090
01:18:42,608 --> 01:18:45,907
I have lived most my life
surrounded by my enemies.

1091
01:18:49,982 --> 01:18:54,146
I will be grateful
to die among my friends.

1092
01:18:58,491 --> 01:19:00,391
You are an honorable man, Quill.

1093
01:19:02,128 --> 01:19:04,289
I will fight beside you.

1094
01:19:05,531 --> 01:19:06,998
And in the end,

1095
01:19:09,001 --> 01:19:10,992
I will see my wife and daughter again.

1096
01:19:17,009 --> 01:19:20,137
I am Groot.

1097
01:19:30,490 --> 01:19:33,687
What the hell.
I don't got that long a lifespan, anyway.

1098
01:19:39,732 --> 01:19:41,962
Now I'm standing. Y'all happy?

1099
01:19:42,468 --> 01:19:44,595
We're all standing up now.

1100
01:19:44,804 --> 01:19:48,001
Bunch of jackasses,
standing in a circle.

1101
01:19:55,281 --> 01:19:56,748
The Stone reacts to anything organic.

1102
01:19:56,949 --> 01:19:58,974
The bigger the target,
the bigger the power surge.

1103
01:19:59,085 --> 01:20:02,213
All Ronan's got to do is touch the Stone
to the planet's surface and zap.

1104
01:20:02,422 --> 01:20:04,014
All plants, animals,

1105
01:20:04,223 --> 01:20:05,656
- Nova Corps.
- Everything will die.

1106
01:20:06,359 --> 01:20:08,259
So Ronan does not make the surface.

1107
01:20:11,264 --> 01:20:13,198
<i>Rocket will lead a team to blow a hole</i>

1108
01:20:13,399 --> 01:20:15,492
in the <i>Dark Aster's</i> starboard hull.

1109
01:20:15,701 --> 01:20:19,762
Then, our craft and Yondu's will enter.

1110
01:20:19,872 --> 01:20:22,636
Won't there be
hundreds of Sakaaran soldiers inside?

1111
01:20:22,742 --> 01:20:25,540
I think of Sakaaran as paper people.

1112
01:20:31,717 --> 01:20:32,741
Once they know we're on board,

1113
01:20:32,952 --> 01:20:36,353
Ronan will isolate himself behind
impenetrable security doors on deck.

1114
01:20:36,456 --> 01:20:38,856
<i>Which I can disable</i>
<i>by dismantling the power source.</i>

1115
01:20:39,058 --> 01:20:40,753
<i>We'll make it to the flight deck,</i>

1116
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:43,829
<i>and I'll use the Hadron Enforcer</i>
<i>to kill Ronan.</i>

1117
01:20:46,432 --> 01:20:49,424
Once Ronan is dead,
we will retrieve the Stone.

1118
01:20:50,002 --> 01:20:52,061
Use these devices to contain it.

1119
01:20:52,538 --> 01:20:53,835
If you touch it,

1120
01:20:54,607 --> 01:20:55,904
it will kill you.

1121
01:20:58,778 --> 01:21:02,009
<i>I'll contact one of the Nova officers</i>
<i>who arrested us.</i>

1122
01:21:02,114 --> 01:21:04,708
<i>Hopefully, they'll believe</i>
<i>we're there to help.</i>

1123
01:21:05,318 --> 01:21:08,446
There's one more thing
we need to complete the plan.

1124
01:21:09,255 --> 01:21:10,415
That guy's eye.

1125
01:21:11,390 --> 01:21:13,858
No! No, we don't. No, we don't need

1126
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:15,357
that guy's eye.

1127
01:21:16,496 --> 01:21:19,056
No, seriously, I need it!
It's important to me.

1128
01:21:23,769 --> 01:21:26,602
<i>Ronan's fleet has been spotted,</i>
<i>and will arrive in T-minus</i>

1129
01:21:26,806 --> 01:21:28,398
<i>fifteen minutes.</i>

1130
01:21:28,808 --> 01:21:30,275
Remember, boy.

1131
01:21:30,743 --> 01:21:32,574
At the end of all this,

1132
01:21:32,778 --> 01:21:34,006
I get the Stone.

1133
01:21:34,213 --> 01:21:36,613
You cross me, we kill you all.

1134
01:21:59,305 --> 01:22:00,602
Let's go get 'em, boys!

1135
01:22:10,149 --> 01:22:11,343
This is a terrible plan.

1136
01:22:11,551 --> 01:22:13,610
Hey, you're the one who said
you wanted to die among friends.

1137
01:22:18,591 --> 01:22:19,558
Nova Prime.

1138
01:22:21,260 --> 01:22:22,454
I received a transmission

1139
01:22:22,662 --> 01:22:23,856
from one of the Ravagers.

1140
01:22:24,463 --> 01:22:26,988
He says Ronan's in possession of
something called an Infinity Stone

1141
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:28,564
and he's headed toward Xandar.

1142
01:22:28,668 --> 01:22:29,828
Good God.

1143
01:22:30,036 --> 01:22:31,901
It's a trick. He's a criminal.

1144
01:22:32,104 --> 01:22:34,572
Did he say why we should believe him?

1145
01:22:34,674 --> 01:22:36,801
He said his crew
just escaped from prison

1146
01:22:37,009 --> 01:22:39,944
so he'd have no other reason
to risk coming to Xandar to help.

1147
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:41,906
He says that he's an

1148
01:22:43,015 --> 01:22:44,004
"a-hole."

1149
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:45,577
But he's not,

1150
01:22:45,785 --> 01:22:47,514
and I'm quoting him, here,

1151
01:22:47,620 --> 01:22:49,815
"100% a dick."

1152
01:22:50,022 --> 01:22:51,284
Do you believe him?

1153
01:22:51,991 --> 01:22:55,017
I don't know that I believe anyone
is 100% a dick, ma'am.

1154
01:22:55,127 --> 01:22:58,028
I mean, do you believe
that he is here to help?

1155
01:23:01,767 --> 01:23:02,734
Yeah.

1156
01:23:12,878 --> 01:23:14,277
A fleet approaches.

1157
01:23:14,780 --> 01:23:16,338
They appear to be Ravagers.

1158
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:28,518
Fire!

1159
01:23:39,905 --> 01:23:41,031
<i>Cover it down.</i>

1160
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:43,105
Submerge!

1161
01:23:56,088 --> 01:23:57,248
Rocket, hurry!

1162
01:24:03,796 --> 01:24:04,956
All pilots, dive!

1163
01:24:05,164 --> 01:24:06,290
<i>They're beneath us!</i>

1164
01:24:15,174 --> 01:24:16,539
Evacuate the city.

1165
01:24:16,742 --> 01:24:20,200
Our priority is to get our people
away from the battle.

1166
01:24:27,219 --> 01:24:28,208
Forward thrust, now!

1167
01:24:41,801 --> 01:24:42,768
Come on!

1168
01:24:44,503 --> 01:24:46,027
Quill! Yondu! Now!

1169
01:25:08,394 --> 01:25:09,861
Hell!

1170
01:25:10,062 --> 01:25:11,461
I'm going down, Quill!

1171
01:25:11,664 --> 01:25:13,359
No more games with me, boy!

1172
01:25:13,566 --> 01:25:14,555
I'll see you

1173
01:25:14,767 --> 01:25:16,462
<i>at the end of this!</i>

1174
01:25:22,808 --> 01:25:24,173
There are too many of them, Rocket!

1175
01:25:24,977 --> 01:25:26,672
We'll never make it up there!

1176
01:25:41,727 --> 01:25:42,819
<i>Peter Quill.</i>

1177
01:25:43,028 --> 01:25:45,360
This is Denarian Saal
of the Nova Corps.

1178
01:25:45,564 --> 01:25:48,829
For the record,
I advised against trusting you here.

1179
01:25:49,034 --> 01:25:50,331
They got my "dick" message!

1180
01:25:50,836 --> 01:25:51,962
Prove me wrong.

1181
01:25:59,445 --> 01:26:01,276
Yes!

1182
01:26:22,501 --> 01:26:23,559
Yes!

1183
01:26:27,039 --> 01:26:28,666
We're just like Kevin Bacon.

1184
01:26:32,945 --> 01:26:34,412
The starboard kern has been breached!

1185
01:26:34,613 --> 01:26:35,910
We have been boarded.

1186
01:26:36,015 --> 01:26:37,380
Continue our approach.

1187
01:26:37,583 --> 01:26:38,811
But the Nova Corps have engaged.

1188
01:26:39,018 --> 01:26:41,612
None of that will matter
once we reach the surface.

1189
01:26:41,787 --> 01:26:42,754
Seal security doors!

1190
01:26:42,988 --> 01:26:43,977
Now!

1191
01:26:45,791 --> 01:26:48,021
Get out of my way!

1192
01:26:59,305 --> 01:27:00,772
Oh, man.

1193
01:27:00,973 --> 01:27:05,307
All Nova pilots,
interlock and form a blockade.

1194
01:27:05,511 --> 01:27:09,311
<i>The</i> Dark Aster
<i>must not reach the ground.</i>

1195
01:27:21,894 --> 01:27:23,020
Locked in!

1196
01:27:23,929 --> 01:27:25,021
Locked in.

1197
01:27:26,665 --> 01:27:27,632
We're locked in.

1198
01:28:05,971 --> 01:28:08,064
I can barely see.

1199
01:28:34,466 --> 01:28:36,195
When did you learn to do that?

1200
01:28:36,769 --> 01:28:37,827
Pretty sure the answer is

1201
01:28:38,037 --> 01:28:39,561
"I am Groot."

1202
01:28:40,773 --> 01:28:43,241
The flight deck is 300 meters this way.

1203
01:28:46,545 --> 01:28:49,878
I want you all to know that I am grateful
for your acceptance after my blunders.

1204
01:28:50,449 --> 01:28:52,644
It is pleasing to once again have

1205
01:28:53,285 --> 01:28:54,252
friends.

1206
01:28:55,387 --> 01:28:58,254
You, Quill, are my friend.

1207
01:28:58,357 --> 01:28:59,517
Thanks.

1208
01:28:59,725 --> 01:29:01,784
This dumb tree, he is my friend.

1209
01:29:03,963 --> 01:29:05,123
And this green whore, she, too...

1210
01:29:05,297 --> 01:29:06,764
You must stop!

1211
01:29:09,702 --> 01:29:12,398
Gamora, look at what you have done.

1212
01:29:13,205 --> 01:29:15,105
You have always been weak.

1213
01:29:15,407 --> 01:29:17,466
You stupid, traitorous...

1214
01:29:22,715 --> 01:29:24,979
Nobody talks to my friends like that.

1215
01:29:26,151 --> 01:29:27,209
Head to the flight deck.

1216
01:29:27,419 --> 01:29:29,979
I'll shut down the power
to the security doors.

1217
01:29:38,030 --> 01:29:39,793
Yondu Udonta.

1218
01:29:39,999 --> 01:29:43,457
Order your men
to turn on the Nova Corps.

1219
01:30:00,285 --> 01:30:01,775
Enough nonsense, Ravager!

1220
01:30:01,987 --> 01:30:03,750
Time to die...

1221
01:30:36,488 --> 01:30:37,477
Nebula, please.

1222
01:30:52,037 --> 01:30:54,733
Enough of this. Necrocraft pilots,

1223
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:56,965
enact immolation initiative.

1224
01:31:00,546 --> 01:31:02,036
They're dive-bombing the city!

1225
01:31:02,147 --> 01:31:03,876
Denarian Saal,
should we break formation?

1226
01:31:04,083 --> 01:31:05,675
No! Hold your positions.

1227
01:31:37,382 --> 01:31:38,747
Keep Ronan up there, Saal.

1228
01:31:38,951 --> 01:31:40,578
<i>We'll take care of the people</i>
<i>down here.</i>

1229
01:31:40,686 --> 01:31:42,813
I can't believe
I'm taking orders from a hamster.

1230
01:31:46,058 --> 01:31:47,252
Star-Lord.

1231
01:31:47,759 --> 01:31:48,726
Finally.

1232
01:31:59,671 --> 01:32:00,695
You thief!

1233
01:32:12,618 --> 01:32:15,416
You will never make it to Ronan.

1234
01:32:21,193 --> 01:32:23,423
Everybody shoot them
before they hit the ground.

1235
01:32:32,104 --> 01:32:33,435
Come on!

1236
01:33:16,315 --> 01:33:19,751
Finger to the throat means death.

1237
01:33:25,624 --> 01:33:26,989
Metaphor.

1238
01:33:27,192 --> 01:33:28,420
Yeah, sorta.

1239
01:33:28,627 --> 01:33:29,753
No.

1240
01:33:57,756 --> 01:33:59,155
Xandar!

1241
01:33:59,858 --> 01:34:02,418
You stand accused.

1242
01:34:03,295 --> 01:34:06,264
<i>Your wretched peace treaty will not</i>

1243
01:34:06,465 --> 01:34:07,625
<i>save you now.</i>

1244
01:34:08,166 --> 01:34:11,363
It is the tinder on which you burn.

1245
01:34:36,028 --> 01:34:36,995
Rocket!

1246
01:34:37,195 --> 01:34:38,924
Hold on, Saal, just...

1247
01:35:05,724 --> 01:35:06,884
Quill, you gotta hurry.

1248
01:35:07,092 --> 01:35:08,719
<i>The city's been evacuated,</i>

1249
01:35:08,827 --> 01:35:11,387
<i>but we're getting our asses</i>
<i>kicked down here.</i>

1250
01:35:11,496 --> 01:35:12,895
Gamora hasn't opened the door!

1251
01:35:37,656 --> 01:35:38,623
Nebula!

1252
01:35:40,225 --> 01:35:42,716
Sister, help us fight Ronan.

1253
01:35:42,928 --> 01:35:44,361
You know he's crazy.

1254
01:35:44,863 --> 01:35:46,854
I know you're both crazy.

1255
01:35:47,065 --> 01:35:48,191
No!

1256
01:35:51,136 --> 01:35:52,103
What the?

1257
01:35:53,405 --> 01:35:54,895
Get out!

1258
01:36:36,348 --> 01:36:37,315
You did it!

1259
01:37:03,875 --> 01:37:05,137
I was mistaken.

1260
01:37:05,243 --> 01:37:06,801
I do remember your family.

1261
01:37:07,479 --> 01:37:09,174
Their screams were

1262
01:37:09,381 --> 01:37:11,440
pitiful. I...

1263
01:39:08,633 --> 01:39:09,691
No, Groot!

1264
01:39:10,335 --> 01:39:11,427
You can't.

1265
01:39:11,536 --> 01:39:12,969
You'll die.

1266
01:39:13,572 --> 01:39:15,369
Why are you doing this?

1267
01:39:15,574 --> 01:39:17,007
Why?

1268
01:39:23,682 --> 01:39:25,172
We

1269
01:39:25,650 --> 01:39:26,639
are

1270
01:39:27,319 --> 01:39:28,752
Groot.

1271
01:40:33,218 --> 01:40:35,209
I called him an idiot.

1272
01:40:57,976 --> 01:40:59,876
You killed Groot!

1273
01:41:04,082 --> 01:41:05,310
Behold!

1274
01:41:06,284 --> 01:41:09,720
Your guardians of the galaxy.

1275
01:41:09,821 --> 01:41:12,255
What fruit have they wrought?

1276
01:41:12,357 --> 01:41:16,453
Only that my father and his father

1277
01:41:16,561 --> 01:41:20,088
shall finally know vengeance.

1278
01:41:20,298 --> 01:41:22,493
People of Xandar,

1279
01:41:23,168 --> 01:41:24,863
the time has come

1280
01:41:25,070 --> 01:41:27,834
to rejoice and renounce

1281
01:41:28,039 --> 01:41:30,234
your paltry gods!

1282
01:41:31,109 --> 01:41:34,408
Your salvation is at hand.

1283
01:41:47,192 --> 01:41:48,659
Listen to these words.

1284
01:41:57,769 --> 01:41:59,396
Now bring it down hard!

1285
01:42:02,874 --> 01:42:03,863
What are you doing?

1286
01:42:04,442 --> 01:42:06,967
Dance-off, bro. Me and you.

1287
01:42:10,448 --> 01:42:11,813
Gamora.

1288
01:42:12,884 --> 01:42:14,875
Subtle. Take it back.

1289
01:42:15,386 --> 01:42:17,547
What are you doing?

1290
01:42:17,922 --> 01:42:20,220
I'm distracting you,
you big turd blossom.

1291
01:42:36,474 --> 01:42:37,964
No!

1292
01:43:11,976 --> 01:43:15,070
Peter! Take my hand!

1293
01:43:20,518 --> 01:43:22,486
Take my hand, Peter.

1294
01:43:23,454 --> 01:43:24,819
Mom.

1295
01:43:25,356 --> 01:43:27,381
<i>Take my hand!</i>

1296
01:44:21,846 --> 01:44:23,780
You're mortal!

1297
01:44:23,982 --> 01:44:25,210
How?

1298
01:44:25,416 --> 01:44:27,611
You said it yourself, bitch.

1299
01:44:27,719 --> 01:44:30,051
We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.

1300
01:44:59,951 --> 01:45:01,145
Well, well, well.

1301
01:45:01,719 --> 01:45:02,743
Quite the light show.

1302
01:45:05,089 --> 01:45:06,716
Ain't this sweet.

1303
01:45:08,326 --> 01:45:10,760
But you got some business to attend to

1304
01:45:10,962 --> 01:45:13,362
before all the nookie-nookie starts.

1305
01:45:15,099 --> 01:45:17,226
Peter, you can't. Peter.

1306
01:45:17,435 --> 01:45:19,426
You gotta reconsider this, Yondu.

1307
01:45:20,004 --> 01:45:21,528
I don't know who you're selling this to,

1308
01:45:21,639 --> 01:45:23,539
but the only way
the universe can survive

1309
01:45:23,741 --> 01:45:25,368
is if you give it to the Nova Corps.

1310
01:45:26,244 --> 01:45:28,371
I may be as pretty as an angel,

1311
01:45:30,682 --> 01:45:32,513
but I sure as hell ain't one.

1312
01:45:34,252 --> 01:45:35,719
Hand it over, son.

1313
01:45:52,603 --> 01:45:53,570
Yondu.

1314
01:45:56,708 --> 01:45:59,939
Do not open that Orb.
You know that, right?

1315
01:46:00,611 --> 01:46:03,045
You've seen what it does to people.

1316
01:46:13,825 --> 01:46:16,020
Yeah, Quill turned out okay.

1317
01:46:16,928 --> 01:46:19,522
It's probably good
we didn't deliver him to his dad

1318
01:46:19,664 --> 01:46:20,631
like we was hired to do.

1319
01:46:20,765 --> 01:46:23,461
Yeah, that guy was a jackass.

1320
01:46:28,373 --> 01:46:31,900
He is gonna be so pissed when he
realizes I switched out the Orb on him.

1321
01:46:34,679 --> 01:46:36,476
He was gonna kill you, Peter.

1322
01:46:37,749 --> 01:46:39,376
I know.

1323
01:46:41,285 --> 01:46:42,877
But he was about the only family I had.

1324
01:46:45,823 --> 01:46:46,812
No.

1325
01:46:48,126 --> 01:46:49,286
He wasn't.

1326
01:47:37,575 --> 01:47:38,837
<i>Why would you even know this?</i>

1327
01:47:39,243 --> 01:47:41,973
When we arrested you, we noticed
an anomaly in your nervous system,

1328
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:43,445
so we had it checked out.

1329
01:47:44,782 --> 01:47:46,374
I'm not Terran?

1330
01:47:46,584 --> 01:47:48,051
You are half Terran.

1331
01:47:48,252 --> 01:47:51,847
Your mother was of Earth.
Your father, well,

1332
01:47:52,056 --> 01:47:55,548
he's something very ancient
we've never seen here before.

1333
01:47:55,927 --> 01:47:57,053
That could be why you were able

1334
01:47:57,261 --> 01:47:59,456
to hold the Stone for as long as you did.

1335
01:48:00,398 --> 01:48:01,365
Your friends have arrived.

1336
01:48:03,301 --> 01:48:05,531
On behalf of the Nova Corps,

1337
01:48:05,970 --> 01:48:08,530
we'd like to express
our profound gratitude

1338
01:48:09,407 --> 01:48:11,068
for your help in saving Xandar.

1339
01:48:12,944 --> 01:48:15,606
If you will follow Denarian Dey,

1340
01:48:15,813 --> 01:48:17,371
he has something to show you.

1341
01:48:17,582 --> 01:48:19,277
Thank you, Nova Prime.

1342
01:48:27,925 --> 01:48:32,385
Your wife and child shall rest well
knowing that you have avenged them.

1343
01:48:32,930 --> 01:48:34,056
Yes.

1344
01:48:34,265 --> 01:48:36,130
Of course, Ronan was only a puppet.

1345
01:48:36,934 --> 01:48:39,061
It's really Thanos I need to kill.

1346
01:48:41,772 --> 01:48:44,502
We tried to keep it as close
to the original as possible.

1347
01:48:45,143 --> 01:48:47,077
We salvaged as much as we could.

1348
01:48:50,214 --> 01:48:51,181
I...

1349
01:48:53,217 --> 01:48:54,275
Thank you.

1350
01:48:55,887 --> 01:48:57,479
I have a family.

1351
01:48:58,055 --> 01:48:59,488
They're alive because of you.

1352
01:49:04,228 --> 01:49:06,560
Your criminal records
have also been expunged.

1353
01:49:06,764 --> 01:49:10,666
However, I have to warn you against
breaking any laws in the future.

1354
01:49:11,335 --> 01:49:12,302
Question.

1355
01:49:12,503 --> 01:49:13,629
What if I see something
that I want to take,

1356
01:49:13,738 --> 01:49:15,035
and it belongs to someone else?

1357
01:49:15,139 --> 01:49:16,401
You will be arrested.

1358
01:49:16,507 --> 01:49:18,668
But what if I want it more
than the person who has it?

1359
01:49:19,210 --> 01:49:21,201
- It's still illegal.
- That doesn't follow.

1360
01:49:21,412 --> 01:49:22,379
No, I want it more, sir.
Do you understand?

1361
01:49:22,980 --> 01:49:24,140
What are you laughing at?

1362
01:49:24,348 --> 01:49:25,781
Why? I can't have a discussion
with this gentleman?

1363
01:49:25,883 --> 01:49:27,680
What if someone
does something irksome

1364
01:49:27,885 --> 01:49:30,046
and I decide to remove his spine?

1365
01:49:31,656 --> 01:49:32,714
That's...

1366
01:49:33,858 --> 01:49:36,019
That's actually murder.

1367
01:49:37,862 --> 01:49:40,353
It's one of the worst crimes of all.

1368
01:49:40,565 --> 01:49:43,363
So... also illegal.

1369
01:49:47,004 --> 01:49:47,993
They'll be fine, Dey.

1370
01:49:48,739 --> 01:49:49,899
I'm gonna keep an eye on 'em.

1371
01:49:50,074 --> 01:49:51,041
You?

1372
01:49:54,545 --> 01:49:57,480
Yeah. Me.

1373
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:17,990
<i>Peter,</i>

1374
01:50:18,603 --> 01:50:21,902
<i>I know these last few months</i>
<i>have been hard for you.</i>

1375
01:50:23,241 --> 01:50:25,801
<i>But I'm going to a better place.</i>

1376
01:50:26,010 --> 01:50:28,410
<i>And I will be okay.</i>

1377
01:50:28,613 --> 01:50:32,310
<i>And I will always be with you.</i>

1378
01:50:34,051 --> 01:50:36,679
<i>You are the light of my life.</i>

1379
01:50:36,887 --> 01:50:39,082
<i>My precious son.</i>

1380
01:50:40,091 --> 01:50:42,992
<i>My little Star-Lord.</i>

1381
01:50:43,761 --> 01:50:45,695
<i>Love, Mom.</i>

1382
01:52:46,317 --> 01:52:47,875
So, what should we do next?

1383
01:52:48,285 --> 01:52:49,252
Something good?

1384
01:52:50,321 --> 01:52:51,345
Something bad?

1385
01:52:51,922 --> 01:52:53,514
A bit of both?

1386
01:52:55,192 --> 01:52:58,059
We'll follow your lead, Star-Lord.

1387
01:53:00,364 --> 01:53:01,353
Bit of both.

1388
02:00:25,742 --> 02:00:28,006
What do you let it lick you like that for?

1389
02:00:29,379 --> 02:00:30,903
Gross.

1390
02:00:33,984 --> 02:00:35,417
<i>Yeah!</i>

1391
02:00:35,552 --> 02:00:37,349
<i>But it burns going down.</i>
