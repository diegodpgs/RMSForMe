00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:51,310
Oh, I come from a land
From a faraway place

3
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:54,639
Where the caravan camels roam

4
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:58,567
Where it's flat and immense
And the heat is intense

5
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:02,146
It's barbaric, but hey, it's home

6
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,733
When the wind's from the east
And the sun's from the west

7
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,945
And the sand in the glass is right

8

11
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:25,295

12

Are hotter than hot

I have never seen
one of these intact before.

This is the famous
Dead Sea Tupperware.

in the exceptionally rare.

I think, then, you would be
most rewarded to consider this.

Do not be fooled
by its commonplace appearance.

38

it is not what is outside,

This is no ordinary lamp.

of a young man's life.

was more than what he seemed.

00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,729
couldn't we just wait for a real storm?

327
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,235
Save your breath, Iago. Faster.

328
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,784
Yes, O mighty evil one.

329
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,118
(PANTING)

330
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,577
Part, sands of time.

331
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:03,582
Reveal to me the one
who can enter the cave.

332
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:06,790
Yes! Yes!

333
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,709
There he is.

334
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,090
My diamond in the rough.

335
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:15,594
That's him? That's the clown
we've been waitin' for?

336
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:22,142
Let's have the guards extend him
an invitation to the palace, shall we?

337
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,398
Swell.

338
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,645

Almost there.

341
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,994
I want to thank you
for stopping that man.

342
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,333
Uh, forget it.

343
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,629
So, this is your first time
in the marketplace, huh?

344
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,751
Is it that obvious?

345
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,838
Well, you do kind of stand out.

346
00:20:56,672 --> 00:21:00,347
I mean, uh, you don't seem to know
how dangerous Agrabah can be.

347
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,100
Hmm. I'm a fast learner.

348
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,602
Wow.

349
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,642
(CHUCKLING) Hey.

350
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,692
Come on. This way.

351
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,986
Whoa. Watch your head there.

352
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,533
Be careful.

353
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,236
Is this where you live?

354
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:22,119
Yep. Just me and Abu.
Come and go as we please.

355
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:23,950
That sounds fabulous.

356
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:28,163
Well, it's not much,
but it's got a great view.

357
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,833
Wow. The palace looks
pretty amazing, huh?

358
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,128
Oh, it's wonderful.

359
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,509
I wonder what it would
be like to live there,

360
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:40,262
and have servants and valets.

361
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:43,641
Oh, sure. People who tell you
where to go and how to dress.

362
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:46,351
It's better than here.

363
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,979
You're always scraping for food
and ducking the guards.

364

You're not free
to make your own choices.

- You're just...

- Trapped.

What does it matter?

369
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:07,915
I ran away and I am not going back.

370
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:12,085
- Really? How come?
- Why, you...

371
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,419
My father's forcing me to get married.

372
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,759
That's... That's awful.

Abu says, uh, that's not fair.

What?

377
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,020
- Oh, did he?
- Yeah, of course.

378
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:38,153
And does Abu
have anything else to say?

379
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:41,361
Well, uh, he wishes there was
something he could do to help.

Tell him that's very sweet.

383
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,546
Here you are.

384
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,794
- They're after me!
- They're after you?

385
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,217
My father must have sent them...

386
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,464
- Do you trust me?
- What?

387

- Do you trust me?
- Yes...

388

Then jump!

We just keep running into each other,
don't we, street rat?

- It's the dungeon for you, boy.
- Get off of me.

00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:21,908
Let him go.

- Looky here, men. A street mouse.
- (GUARDS LAUGH)

- The princess?
- ABU: Princess?

398
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:38,425
What are you doing outside the palace?
And with this street rat.

399
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,550
That's not your concern.
Do as I command. Release him.

400
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:46,385
I would, Princess,
except my orders come from Jafar.

401
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:50,188
- You'll have to take it up with him.
- Believe me, I will.

Oh, Princess.

Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck.

How may I be of service to you?

00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,326
The guards just took a boy
from the market, on your orders.

407
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:12,623
Your father has charged me
with keeping peace in Agrabah.

408

- The boy was a criminal.
- What was his crime?

I can't breathe, Jafar.

410
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:20,592
Why, kidnapping the princess,
of course.

411
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:22,921
If you could just... Aah! That hurt!

412
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,597
He didn't kidnap me. I ran away.

Oh, dear.

414
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:32,681
Oh, how frightfully upsetting.

has already been carried out.

- Death.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Don't worry, Abu.
I'll never see her again.

I'm a street rat, remember?
And there's a law.

- She deserves a prince.
- Ta-da!

But together, perhaps we can be more.

I'm listening.

There is a cave, boy,

00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,570
Ah, almost.

650
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,741
There are a few provisos,
a couple of quid pro quos.

651
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:02,942
Like?

652
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:06,200
Ah, rule number one, I can't kill anybody.

653
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,622
So don't ask.

654
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:08,949
Rule number two.

655
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:12,662
I can't make anybody
fall in love with anybody else.

656
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,246
You little ponem there.

657
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:19,927
Rule number three. I can't bring
people back from the dead.

658
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:22,845
It's not a pretty picture.
I don't like doing it.

659
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:25,511
Other than that, you got it.

660
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,095
- Hmm.
- Oh!

661
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:32,439
Provisos? You mean limitations?

662
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,608
On wishes? Some all-powerful genie.

663
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:38,482
Can't even bring people
back from the dead.

664
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,986
I don't know, Abu. He probably
can't even get us out of this cave.

665
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:44,488
Looks like we're gonna have to
find a way out of here.

666
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,490
Excuse me?

667
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:49,368
Are you lookin' at me?
Did you rub my lamp?

668
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,451
Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?

669
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,535
And all of sudden
you're walking out on me?

670
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:57,463
I don't think so, not right now.

671
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,961
You're gettin' your wishes, so sit down!

672
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:02,294
- (ABU SCREECHES)
- In case of emergency,

673
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:04,880
the exits are here, here,
here, here, anywhere.

674
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,307
Keep your hands and arms
inside the carpet.

675
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,259
We're...

676
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,808
Outta here!

677
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,979
SULTAN: Jafar, this is an outrage.

678
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:19,857
If it weren't for all your years
of loyal service...

679
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:24,316
From now on, you are to discuss
sentencing of prisoners with me,

680
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:26,902
before they are beheaded.

681
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:29,909
I assure you, Your Highness,
it won't happen again.

682
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,406
Jasmine...

683
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:36,287
Jafar. Let's put this whole
messy business behind us.

684
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:37,495
Please.

685
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:42,129
My most abject and humblest apologies
to you as well, Princess.

686
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:45,087
At least some good will come
of my being forced to marry.

687
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:49,428
When I am queen,
I will have the power to get rid of you.

688
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,100
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

689
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,473
There, now. That's nice.
All settled, then.

690
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:57,683
Now, Jasmine, getting back
to this suitor business... Jasmine?

691
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,684
Jasmine!

692
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,568
(GROWLS)

693
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,944
If only I had gotten that lamp.

694
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:08,118
"I will have the power to get rid of you."

695
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:11,787
(GROWLING)
To think we gotta keep kissing up

696
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:15,538
to that chump and his chump daughter

697
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:18,119
- for the rest of our lives...
- No, Iago.

698
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:22,002
Only until she finds a chump husband.

699
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,917
Then she'll have us banished.

700
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,586
Or beheaded.

701
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,213
BOTH: Eww!

702
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,637
Oh. Wait a minute. Jafar.

703
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:34,560
What if you were the chump husband?

704
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:35,852
What?

705
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:39,228
Okay, you marry the princess, all right?

706
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:42,777
And, uh, then you become the sultan.

707
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:43,899
Oh.

708
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:47,232
Marry the shrew.

709
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:49,113
I become the sultan.

710
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:53,072
- The idea has merit.
- Yes, merit. Yes.

711
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:59,662
And then we drop papa-in-law
and the little woman off a cliff.

712
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,750
Yaaah!

713
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,672
Kersplat!

714

(WICKED LAUGHTER)

715
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:08,670
I love the way
your foul little mind works.

716
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:11,555
(BOTH LAUGH SINISTERLY)

717
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:21,600
Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet
for all your travel needs.

718
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:25,277
Don't stand until the rug
has come to a complete stop.

719
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:28,482
Thank you. Goodbye now.
Good-bye. Thank you.

720
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:32,694
Well, how about that,
Mr. Doubting Mustafa?

721
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:37,703
Oh, you sure showed me.
Now, about my three wishes.

722
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,913
Dost mine ears deceive me?

723
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:43,087
Three? You are down by one, boy.

724
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:46,962
Ah, no. I never actually wished
to get out of the cave.

725
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,793
You did that on your own.

726
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:53,090
Well, I feel sheepish.

727
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:56,388
All right, you bad boy,
but no more freebies.

728
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:59,638
Fair deal. So, three wishes.

729
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,848
I want them to be good.

730
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:03,649
What would you wish for?

731
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,101
Me?

732
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,987
No one's ever asked me that before.

733
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:11,362
Well, in my case... Ah, forget it.

734
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,987
- What?
- No, I can't. I...

735
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,490
Come on. Tell me.

736
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,413
Freedom.

737
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,535
You're a prisoner?

738
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,992
It's all part and parcel
of the whole genie gig.

739
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:24,750
Phenomenal cosmic powers...

740
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:26,251
Itty bitty living space.

741
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,503
Genie, that's terrible.

742
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:31,678
But, oh, to be free...

743
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,629
Not have to go,
"Poof. What do you need?

744
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:36,182
"Poof. What do you need?
Poof. What do you need?"

745
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:38,180
To be my own master.

746
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:41,138
Such a thing would be greater
than all the magic

747
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,520
and all the treasures in all the world.

748
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:45,896
But what am I talking about?

749
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:48,353
Let's get real here.
It's not gonna happen.

750
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:50,814
Genie, wake up and smell the hummus.

751
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,155
Why not?

752
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:56,111
The only way I get outta this
is if my master wishes me out.

753
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:58,746
So you can guess how often
that's happened.

754
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,414
I'll do it. I'll set you free.

755
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:04,744
- Uh-huh, yeah, right.
- No, really, I promise.

756
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,420
After I make my first two wishes,

757
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,793
I'll use my third wish to set you free.

758
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:12,134
Well, here's hopin'. All right.

759
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,338
Let's make some magic.

760
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,139
So how 'bout it?
What is it you want most?

761
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:21,307
Well, there's this girl.

762
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,432
Wrong.

763
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:25,264
I can't make anybody
fall in love, remember?

764
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:29,728
Oh, but, Genie,
she's smart and fun and...

765
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,778
- Pretty?
- Beautiful.

766
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:35,074
She's got these eyes that just...
And this hair. Wow.

767
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,322
And her smile... (SIGHS)

768
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:38,949
Ami.

769
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:41,239
C'est l'amour.

770
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:43,370
But she's the princess.

771
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,827
To even have a chance, I'd have to be...

772
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:48,709
Hey, can you make me a prince?

773
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,214
Let's see here.

774
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:53,042
Chicken à la king? Nope.

775
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:56,299
Alaskan king crab.
Ow. I hate it when they do that.

776
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:58,848
Caesar salad. Ah! Et tu, Brute? No.

777
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:01,802
Aha. "To make a prince."

778
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:04,687
Is that an official wish?
Say the magic words.

779
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,606
Genie, I wish for you
to make me a prince.

780
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:09,059
All right!

781
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,435
Yo, yo! Woof! Woof!

782
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:14,568

is much too third century.

What are we trying to say, beggar?

784
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:18,910
No. Let's work with me here.

785
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,117
Ooh. I like it. Muy macho.

786
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:25,458
Now, it still needs something.
What does it say to me?

787
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:28,286
It says mode of transportation.

788
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:31,248
Excuse me, monkey boy.
Aquí. Over here.

- GENIE: Here he comes.

What better way to make your
entrance on the streets of Agrabah

791
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:40,180
than riding

Watch out. They spit.

793
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,638
Mmm. Not enough.

794
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:48,389
Still not enough.
Let's see. What do you need?

795
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:50,937
Yes!

Awk. The problem with your daughter.

808
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,650
Oh, really?

809
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:35,069
Right here.

810
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:39,524
"If the princess has not chosen
a husband by the appointed time,

811
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:42,577
"then the sultan shall choose for her."

812
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,905
But Jasmine hated all those suitors.

813
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:47,990
How could I choose someone
she hates?

814
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:50,452
Not to worry, my liege. There is more.

815
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:54,831
"If in the event
a suitable prince cannot be found..."

816
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:55,915
Jerk.

817
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:59,468
"A princess must then be wed to..."

818
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:03,097
Hmm. Interesting.

819
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:04,887
What? Who?

820
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,512
The royal vizier.

821
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:09,937
Why, that would be me.

822
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:15,355
But I thought the law says
that only a prince can marry a princess.

823
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:16,731
I'm quite sure that...

824
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:20,441
Desperate times call
for desperate measures, my lord.

825
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,989
Yes. Desperate measures.

826
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:28,581
You will order the princess to marry me.

827
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:33,378
I will order the princess to...

828
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,414
But you're so old.

829
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:39,626
The princess will marry me.

830
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:41,594
The princess will marry...

831
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:44,388
- (TRUMPET FANFARE)
- What? What is that?

832
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:45,760
That music.

833
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:50,011
(CHUCKLING)

834
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,688
Jafar, you must come and see this.

835
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:59,529
(SINGING) Make way for Prince Ali

836
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:06,452
Say, "Hey, it's Prince Ali"

837
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:08,663
Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar

838
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:11,331
Hey you, let us through
It's a bright new star

839
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:15,002
Oh come, be the first on your block
To meet his eye

840
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:19,173
Make way, here he comes
Ring bells, bang the drums

841
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:21,046
You're gonna love this guy

842
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:26,173
Prince Ali, fabulous he
Ali Ababwa

843
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:30,393
Genuflect, show some respect
Down on one knee

844
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,767
Now, try your best to stay calm

845
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:35,940
Brush up your Sunday salaam

846
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:40,441
Then come and meet
His spectacular coterie

847
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:45,195
Prince Ali, mighty is he
Ali Ababwa

848
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:49,199
Strong as 10 regular men definitely

849
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,331
He faced the galloping hordes

850
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:54,701
A hundred bad guys with swords

851
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:59,164
Who sent those goons to their lords?
Why, Prince Ali

852
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:02,500
He's got 75 golden camels

853
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:04,051
Don't they look lovely, June?

854
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,925
Purple peacocks, he's got 53

855
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,597
Fabulous, Harry. I love the feathers.

856
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:13,223
When it comes to exotic-type mammals

857
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:15,179
Has he got a zoo
I'm telling you

858
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,515
It's a world-class menagerie

859
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:22,024
Prince Ali, handsome is he
Ali Ababwa

860
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:26,824
That physique, how can I speak
Weak at the knee

861
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:29,072
Well, get on out in that square

862
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:31,324
Adjust your veil and prepare

863
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:35,499
To gawk and grovel and stare
At Prince Ali

864
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:39,670
- He's got 95 white Persian monkeys
- He's got the monkeys

865
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:43,375
- Let's see the monkeys
- And to view them he charges no fee

866
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,959
He's generous
So generous

867
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:48,421
He's got slaves
He's got servants and flunkies

868
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:51,174
Proud to work for him
They bow to his whim, love serving him

869
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:55,228
They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali

870
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:58,055
Prince Ali

871
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:04,737
Prince Ali, Amorous he
Ali Ababwa

872
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:09,158
Heard your princess
Was a sight lovely to see

873
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:11,235
And that, good people, is why

874
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,412
He got dolled up and dropped by

875
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,410
With 60 elephants, llamas galore

876
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,708
With bears and lions
A brass band and more

877
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,456
With his 40 fakirs
His cooks, his bakers

878
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:21,253
His birds that warble on key

879
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,422
Make way

880
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:29,721
For Prince Ali

881
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:34,433
Splendid. Absolutely marvellous.

882
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,926
(CLEARS THROAT)

883
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,978
Your Majesty,

884
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:40,647
I have journeyed from afar
to seek your daughter's hand.

885
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:42,475
Prince Ali Ababwa.

886
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:45,653
Of course. I'm delighted to meet you.

887
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:49,699
This is my royal vizier, Jafar.
He's delighted, too.

888
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:51,697
Ecstatic.

889
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,745
- I'm afraid, Prince Abubu...
- Ababwa.

890
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:55,992
Whatever.

891
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:59,166
You cannot just parade in here
uninvited and expect to...

892
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:02,586
By Allah,
this is quite a remarkable device.

893
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:03,878
Ooh.

894
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:07,587
I don't suppose I might...

895
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:10,802
Why, certainly, Your Majesty.
Allow me.

896
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:15,091
Sire, I must advise against this.

897
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:18,139
Oh, button up, Jafar.
Learn to have a little fun.

898
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,845
Ow, ow, ow.

899
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,473
Ahh! Whoa!

900
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,274
Look out, here I come.

901
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:31,362
Just where did you say you were from?

902
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,241
Oh, much farther than
you've travelled, I'm sure.

903
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,573
- Try me.
- SULTAN: Look out, Polly.

904
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,330
Hey, watch it.

905
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,411
Watch it with the dumb rug.

906
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:46,334
Aah!

907
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,044
Whew!

908
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:56,549
Out of the way. I'm coming in to land.

909
00:52:56,632 --> 00:52:58,475
Jafar, watch this.

910
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:01,019
- Spectacular, Your Highness.
- That was lovely.

911
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:05,775
Yes, I do seem to have a knack for it.

912
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,227
This is a very impressive youth.

913
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,563
And a prince besides.

914
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:14,241
(WHISPERS) If we're lucky, you won't
have to marry Jasmine after all.

915
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:17,035
- I don't trust him, Sire.
- Nonsense.

916
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:21,708
One thing I pride myself on, Jafar,
I'm an excellent judge of character.

917
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:24,456
Oh, excellent judge. Yeah, sure. Not!

918
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:28,081
SULTAN: Jasmine will like this one.

919
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:30,336
And I'm pretty sure
I'll like Princess Jasmine.

920
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:34,592
Your Highness, no.
I must intercede on Jasmine's behalf.

921
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:36,885
This boy is no different from the others.

922
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:39,683
What makes him think
he is worthy of the princess?

923
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:43,012
Your Majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa.

924
00:53:43,095 --> 00:53:46,065
Just let her meet me.
I will win your daughter.

925
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,687
How dare you.

926
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:51,612
All of you.
Standing around deciding my future?

927
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:54,482
I am not a prize to be won.

928
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:56,866
Oh, dear.

929
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:02,327
Don't worry, Prince Ali.
Just give Jasmine time to cool down.

930
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:07,458
I think it's time to say good-bye
to Prince Abubu.

931
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:13,208
ALADDIN: (SIGHS)
What am I gonna do?

932
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:15,670
Jasmine won't even let me talk to her.

933
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:19,348
I should've known I couldn't pull off
this stupid prince wish.

934
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,967
(GROWLING)

935
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,512
So move.

936
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:27,014
Hey.

937
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:30,101
That's a good move.

938
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:32,528
I can't believe it. I'm losing to a rug.

939
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,646
Genie, I need help.

940
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:37,449
All right, Sparky, here's the deal.

941
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:40,869
If you wanna court the little lady,
you gotta be a straight shooter.

942
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:43,367
- Do you got it?
- What?

943
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:45,870
(READING)

944
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,166
No way.

945
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:51,622
If Jasmine found out I was really
some crummy street rat,

946
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:52,877
she'd laugh at me.

947
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,425
A woman appreciates a man
who can make her laugh.

948
00:54:56,752 --> 00:55:01,098
AI, all joking aside,
you really ought to be yourself.

949
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:03,096
Hey, that's the last thing I wanna be.

950
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:05,310
Okay, I'm gonna go see her.

951
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:09,561
I just...
I gotta be smooth, cool, confident.

952
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:12,731
How do I look?

953
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:16,401
Like a prince.

954
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,581

00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:35,291
- Who's there?
- It's me, Prince Ali.

957
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:38,924
Ahem. Uh, Prince Ali Ababwa.

958
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,595
I do not want to see you.

959
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:42,969
No, no, please, Princess.
Give me a chance.

960
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:45,801
- JASMINE: Just leave me alone.
- Down, kitty.

961
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,437
So, how's our little beau doing?

- Good kitty, take off.

Down, kitty.

Wait. Wait.

965
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,191
Do I know you?

00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,615
Uh, no. No.

967
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:04,328
You remind me of someone
I met in the marketplace.

968
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:06,781
The marketplace?

969
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:09,208
I have servants who go
to the marketplace for me.

970
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:13,879
Why, I even have servants who go to
the marketplace for my servants,

971
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:15,547
so it couldn't have been me you met.

972
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:19,968
No. I guess not.

973
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:22,887
GENIE: Enough about you, Casanova.
Talk about her.

974
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:25,682
She's smart, fun, the hair, the eyes.

975
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,259
Anything. Pick a feature.

976
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:30,266
Ahem. Uh, Princess Jasmine?
You're very...

977
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:32,063
Wonderful, magnificent, glorious,

978
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:33,436
- punctual.
- Punctual.

979
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:34,687
- Punctual?
- Sorry.

980
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:37,231
- Uh, beautiful.
- Nice recovery.

981
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:38,312
Hmm.

982
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:40,030
I'm rich, too, you know.

983
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:43,567
- Yeah.
- The daughter of a sultan.

984
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:45,824
I know.

985
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:48,827
A fine prize for any prince to marry.

986
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:52,163
Uh, right. Right. A prince like me.

987
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,835
Warning! Warning!

988
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:56,005
Right. A prince like you.

989
00:56:56,705 --> 00:57:00,335
And every other stuffed shirt,
swaggering peacock I've met.

00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,135
Mayday! Mayday!

JASMINE: Just go jump off a balcony!

992

- What?
- Stop her. Stop her!

993
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,223
- Want me to sting her?
- Buzz off.

994
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:14,102
Okay, fine.
But remember, "bee" yourself.

995
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:15,933
- Yeah, right.
- What?

996
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:18,686
Uh... Uh, you're right.

997
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:23,274
(SIGHS) You aren't just
some prize to be won.

998
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:26,035
You should be free
to make your own choice.

999
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:27,994
I'll go now.

1000
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:30,072
- No!
- What? What?

1001
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,952
How...

1002
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:33,705
How are you doing that?

1003
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:36,708
- It's a magic carpet.
- It's lovely.

- (KISSES)
- You, uh...

1005
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:42,584
You don't want to go for a ride, do you?

1006
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:45,592
We could get out of the palace,
see the world.

1007
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:47,969
- Is it safe?
- Sure. Do you trust me?

1008
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,053
- What?
- Do you trust me?

1009
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:55,897
Yes.

1010
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:14,958
(SINGING) I can show you the world

1011
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:19,414
Shining, shimmering, splendid

1012
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,123
Tell me, Princess

1013
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:27,176
Now, when did you last
Let your heart decide

1014
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:31,134
I can open your eyes

1015
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:34,603
Take you wonder by wonder

1016

Over, sideways and under

No one to tell us no
Or where to go

1021
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:56,788
Or say we're only dreaming

1022
00:58:56,867 --> 00:59:00,622
A whole new world

1023

A dazzling place
I never knew

1024
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:09,297
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear

1025
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:13,555
That now I'm in
A whole new world with you

Indescribable feeling

- A whole new world
- Every turn a surprise

1036

- With new horizons to pursue
- Every moment red-letter

BOTH: I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare

1038
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:05,441
Let me share
This whole new world with you

1039

- A whole new world
- A whole new world

1040

- That's where we'll be
- That's where we'll be

1041
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:17,581
- A thrilling chase
- A wondrous place

1042
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:21,377
For you and me

1043
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:38,764
- It's all so magical.
- Yeah.

1044
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:43,565
It's a shame Abu had to miss this.

1045
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,817
Nah. He hates fireworks.

1046
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:47,819
He doesn't like flying, either.

1047
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:51,899
Uh, that is, um... Oh, no.

1048

You are the boy from the market.
I knew it.

1049
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:56,578
- Why did you lie to me?
- Jasmine, I'm sorry.

1050
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,371
- Did you think I was stupid?
- No.

1051
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:00,369
- That I wouldn't figure it out?
- No.

1052
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:04,578
I mean, I hoped you wouldn't.
No, that's not what I meant.

1053
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:06,663
Who are you? Tell me the truth.

1054
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,419
The truth?

1055
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:12,052
The truth. Um...

1056
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:15,305
The truth is...

1057
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:18,384
I sometimes dress as a commoner, um,

1058
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:20,935
to escape the pressures of palace life.

1059

But I really am a prince.

1060
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:28,393
Why didn't you just tell me?

1061
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,066
Well, you know,

in disguise,

1063

it sounds a little strange,
don't you think?

01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:37,535
Hmm.

1065
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:39,783
Not that strange.

01:24:00,077 --> 01:24:03,297
I'm hittin' the road.
I'm off to see the world. I'm...

1438
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:13,799
Genie, I'm...

1439
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:16,385
I'm gonna miss you.

1440
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:18,641
Me, too, AI. (SNIFFLES)

1441
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:22,140
No matter what anybody says,

1442
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:25,694
you'll always be a prince to me.

1443
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:28,026
That's right.

1444
01:24:28,105 --> 01:24:31,279
You've certainly proven your worth
as far as I'm concerned.

1445
01:24:32,276 --> 01:24:34,870
It's that law that's the problem.

1446
01:24:34,945 --> 01:24:38,119
- Father?
- Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?

1447
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:39,825
From this day forth,

1448
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:44,505
the princess shall marry
whomever she deems worthy.

1449
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:47,340
Him. I choose...

1450
01:24:48,458 --> 01:24:51,177
I choose you, Aladdin.

1451
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:54,715
Call me AI.

1452
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:59,182
Oh, all of you, come over here.
Big group hug.

1453
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:00,979
Group hug.

1454
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:02,647
Mind if I kiss the monkey?

1455
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:04,607
Ooh, hairball.

1456
01:25:04,683 --> 01:25:07,232
Well, I can't do any more damage
around this popsicle stand.

1457
01:25:07,311 --> 01:25:09,780
I'm outta here!

1458
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:12,278
Bye-bye, you two crazy lovebirds!

1459
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:15,031
Hey, Rugman, ciao. I'm history.

1460
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:16,737
No, I'm mythology.

1461
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:19,744
I don't care what I am. I'm free!

1462
01:25:22,868 --> 01:25:25,417
(SINGING) A whole new world

1463
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:28,214
A whole new life

1464
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:34,138
For you and me

1465
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:37,887
A whole new world

1466
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:48,894
(LAUGHING)

1467
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:52,777
Made you look.

1468
01:30:26,296 --> 01:30:28,640
You have been a fabulous audience.

1469
01:30:28,715 --> 01:30:30,888
Tell you what, you're
the best audience in the whole world.

1470
01:30:30,967 --> 01:30:33,595
Take care of yourselves.
Good night, Alice!

1471
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:37,524
Good night, Agrabah! Adiós, amigos!
