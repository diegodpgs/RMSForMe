1
00:03:28,505 --> 00:03:29,703
Where are they?

2
00:03:29,798 --> 00:03:30,829
I don't know.

3
00:03:30,924 --> 00:03:32,382
Dad!

4
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:34,341
Uncle Merrill!

5
00:03:34,427 --> 00:03:37,048
Dad!

6
00:03:41,016 --> 00:03:42,760
Morgan!

7
00:03:54,154 --> 00:03:55,434
Bo? Bo?

8
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,151
Bo, where's Morgan?

9
00:03:58,242 --> 00:03:59,700
Bo?

10
00:03:59,785 --> 00:04:01,575
Are you in my dream,
too?

11
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:03,819
...This is not a dr...
...Dad!

12
00:04:03,913 --> 00:04:05,288
Hey...

13
00:04:05,373 --> 00:04:06,868
Honey...

14
00:04:11,128 --> 00:04:13,833
Morgan?
What's happening?

15
00:04:13,923 --> 00:04:16,840
The dogs were barking...
woke us up.

16
00:04:18,803 --> 00:04:20,629
Are you hurt?

17
00:04:20,721 --> 00:04:23,639
I think God did it.

18
00:04:23,724 --> 00:04:25,799
Did what, Morgan?

19
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:47,801
Look, Lee, I don't even care
if it was him.

20
00:05:47,886 --> 00:05:50,424
And you can just have
a word with him,

21
00:05:50,514 --> 00:05:52,341
and that'd be enough for me.

22
00:05:52,432 --> 00:05:56,299
See, it was strange
finding the crops that way.

23
00:05:56,394 --> 00:05:58,683
The kids were confused by it,

24
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:01,097
and, uh, it'd sure take
the strangeness away

25
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,939
if I knew it was just
Lionel and the Wolfington
brothers messing around,

26
00:06:05,027 --> 00:06:07,518
that's all.

27
00:06:07,613 --> 00:06:09,689
At the movies?

28
00:06:09,782 --> 00:06:12,985
Are you sure?

29
00:06:13,077 --> 00:06:14,487
Alright, then.

30
00:06:14,578 --> 00:06:16,618
Uh, thanks for
your patience, Lee.

31
00:06:16,705 --> 00:06:18,033
Yeah. Bye.

32
00:06:22,586 --> 00:06:25,503
Houdini peed.
I think he's sick.

33
00:06:25,588 --> 00:06:27,996
Why don't you
take him outside?

34
00:06:28,091 --> 00:06:29,371
I'll call Dr. Crawford.

35
00:06:29,467 --> 00:06:30,843
He doesn't treat animals.

36
00:06:30,927 --> 00:06:33,679
Well, he'll know
what to do.

37
00:06:49,944 --> 00:06:51,404
Oh. That was quick,
Caroline.

38
00:06:51,488 --> 00:06:53,279
I only called you folks
two hours ago.

39
00:06:53,365 --> 00:06:55,986
Old Mrs. Kendleman
twisted her ankle,

40
00:06:56,075 --> 00:06:58,566
as she puts it,
diving for her life

41
00:06:58,662 --> 00:07:03,038
when a bunch of school kids
rode down the sidewalk
on skateboards.

42
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:06,208
She went down to Thornton's
store this morning

43
00:07:06,294 --> 00:07:09,247
and started spitting
on the new skateboards.

44
00:07:09,338 --> 00:07:10,713
Spitting!

45
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:12,375
By the time I got there,

46
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:15,752
Mrs. Kendleman had sprayed
the whole damned place.

47
00:07:15,844 --> 00:07:18,679
And she must have had
a cold or something.

48
00:07:18,763 --> 00:07:22,595
I'm telling you,
I won't eat for a week.

49
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:27,893
So, what happened
to your crops?

50
00:07:31,568 --> 00:07:34,603
Dad's gonna burn these
again.

51
00:07:42,578 --> 00:07:44,404
It's contaminated.

52
00:07:44,496 --> 00:07:47,166
You don't even know
what that word means.

53
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:51,161
It's not contaminated.

54
00:07:51,253 --> 00:07:53,790
It's just tap water.
Pour it in his bowl.

55
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,457
It tastes funny.

56
00:07:55,549 --> 00:07:57,007
It does not.

57
00:07:57,092 --> 00:07:59,000
And besides, he licks
his butt every day.

58
00:07:59,093 --> 00:08:01,133
I don't think
he'll mind.

59
00:08:17,903 --> 00:08:19,693
Houdini?

60
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,937
Bo, don't run.

61
00:08:22,031 --> 00:08:23,526
What's wrong, boy?

62
00:08:25,493 --> 00:08:26,951
Stop it, Houdini.

63
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:37,452
Look at where
it's bent over, Father.

64
00:08:37,546 --> 00:08:40,500
It's not broken.

65
00:08:40,591 --> 00:08:45,929
Now, what kind of machine
can bend a stalk of corn
over without breaking it?

66
00:08:46,012 --> 00:08:48,503
Can't be by hand.
It's too perfect.

67
00:08:48,598 --> 00:08:52,181
It doesn't sound much
like Lionel Prichard and
the Wolfington brothers.

68
00:08:52,268 --> 00:08:53,811
They can't take a piss

69
00:08:53,895 --> 00:08:56,849
without wetting
the front of their pants.

70
00:08:56,939 --> 00:09:00,143
I don't think anyone
else around here has
had any problems.

71
00:09:00,234 --> 00:09:03,104
I was over at
Theo Henry's farm
yesterday afternoon,

72
00:09:03,195 --> 00:09:05,235
and he would have
mentioned something.

73
00:09:05,322 --> 00:09:07,647
Why were you
at Theo's place?

74
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:11,905
Some animals around
the county have been
acting funny...

75
00:09:11,996 --> 00:09:14,949
and some of them
violent.

76
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,914
What is it, a virus?

77
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,538
I don't think so,
Father.

78
00:09:19,628 --> 00:09:23,292
They're more edgy,
you know, and alert.

79
00:09:23,381 --> 00:09:26,418
It's almost like they
act when they smell
a predator around...

80
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:28,548
peeing on themselves
and everything.

81
00:09:37,395 --> 00:09:41,060
Caroline...

82
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:44,564
please stop calling me
"Father."

83
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,110
What's wrong?

84
00:09:46,194 --> 00:09:48,767
I don't hear my children.

85
00:10:17,557 --> 00:10:20,511
He fell on me.

86
00:10:20,601 --> 00:10:23,270
He wanted to kill Bo.

87
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,613
Did he hurt you?

88
00:10:41,705 --> 00:10:43,282
No.

89
00:10:48,253 --> 00:10:50,826
I'm so sorry, Morgan.

90
00:11:09,565 --> 00:11:13,396
Where were you?

91
00:11:13,485 --> 00:11:14,979
Houdini's sick.

92
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:17,940
Tie Isabel up to the
back of the shed, please,

93
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:21,233
and make sure
the knot's very tight.

94
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:06,607
What's the matter?

95
00:12:06,702 --> 00:12:08,990
There's a monster
outside my room.

96
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:11,830
Can I have
a glass of water?

97
00:12:11,915 --> 00:12:15,331
What's wrong with the water
next to your bed?

98
00:12:15,418 --> 00:12:18,039
It tastes old.

99
00:12:50,618 --> 00:12:53,156
What are you thinking
about?

100
00:12:55,581 --> 00:13:00,326
Why do you talk to Mom
when you're by yourself?

101
00:13:02,504 --> 00:13:04,995
Makes me feel better.

102
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:08,541
Does she ever
answer back?

103
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:14,843
No.

104
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:20,847
She never answers me
either.

105
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:37,863
What?

106
00:13:37,954 --> 00:13:42,450
Lionel Prichard and the
Wolfington brothers are back.

107
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:44,748
It's time for
an arse-whupping.

108
00:13:44,836 --> 00:13:48,003
This is not an intelligent
way to approach this.

109
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:50,545
Lee is a friend of mine.
This is his son.

110
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:52,590
Yeah, we'll be doing Lee
a favour.

111
00:13:52,676 --> 00:13:54,835
Alright, listen...
we both go outside,

112
00:13:54,928 --> 00:13:57,419
move around the house
in opposite directions.

113
00:13:57,514 --> 00:13:59,471
We act crazy,
insane with anger...

114
00:13:59,558 --> 00:14:01,350
make them crap
in their pants,

115
00:14:01,435 --> 00:14:04,435
force them around
till we meet up
on the other side.

116
00:14:04,521 --> 00:14:05,766
Explain "act crazy."

117
00:14:05,855 --> 00:14:07,599
You know,
curse and stuff.

118
00:14:07,691 --> 00:14:08,971
You want me to curse?

119
00:14:09,067 --> 00:14:11,474
You don't mean it.
It's just for show.

120
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:12,767
What?

121
00:14:12,862 --> 00:14:14,321
Well, it won't be
convincing.

122
00:14:14,405 --> 00:14:16,232
It doesn't sound natural
when I curse.

123
00:14:16,324 --> 00:14:18,945
Just make noises, then.

124
00:14:19,034 --> 00:14:20,410
Explain "noises."

125
00:14:20,494 --> 00:14:22,652
Are you gonna do this
or what?

126
00:14:22,746 --> 00:14:24,988
No, I'm not.

127
00:14:25,082 --> 00:14:27,751
Alright, you want them
stealing something in
the house next time?

128
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,210
On the count of three...

129
00:14:29,295 --> 00:14:30,325
...1...
...Alright.

130
00:14:30,421 --> 00:14:31,534
2... 3!

131
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:34,417


132
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:36,963
Aaah!
I'm insane with anger!

133
00:14:37,052 --> 00:14:39,293
We're gonna beat
your arse, bitch!

134
00:14:44,142 --> 00:14:46,715
We're gonna tear
your head off!

135
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:48,638
I'm losing my mind!

136
00:14:51,065 --> 00:14:52,689
It's time for
an arse-whupping!

137
00:14:58,489 --> 00:15:00,315
I cursed.

138
00:15:00,407 --> 00:15:02,115
I heard.

139
00:15:04,786 --> 00:15:08,202
How did he get...

140
00:15:22,803 --> 00:15:25,341
Are you sure
this is Lionel Prichard?

141
00:15:43,073 --> 00:15:45,480
CAROLINE: You like that?

142
00:15:48,577 --> 00:15:51,068
You got an old
baby monitor around?

143
00:15:51,163 --> 00:15:53,156
Bo had an old
baby monitor.

144
00:15:53,248 --> 00:15:56,582
You can use Bo's baby monitor
as a walkie-talkie.

145
00:15:56,668 --> 00:15:58,827
...You can?
...Mm-hmm.

146
00:15:58,921 --> 00:16:01,078
It only works one way,
but that'll do fine.

147
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:07,843
That is, until someone gets
you an old walkie-talkie
left over at the station.

148
00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:09,304
Stop! It's hideous!

149
00:16:09,388 --> 00:16:10,468
Get it off!

150
00:16:10,556 --> 00:16:11,754
I-I know what to do.

151
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,725
Hey, Bo...

152
00:16:14,811 --> 00:16:16,969
turn that down till
Officer Paski leaves.

153
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:18,178
Doy-da!

154
00:16:21,108 --> 00:16:22,982
You're too old
to still be doing this.

155
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:25,274
You take a glass of water,
and you finish it.

156
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:27,401
Now, what's wrong
with this one?

157
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:29,233
It has dust in it.

158
00:16:29,324 --> 00:16:31,032
This one?

159
00:16:31,117 --> 00:16:32,492
A hair.

160
00:16:32,577 --> 00:16:33,953
This one?

161
00:16:34,037 --> 00:16:37,203
Morgan took a sip, and
it has his amoebas in it.

162
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,745
My turn.

163
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:45,751
So, how are you, Merrill?

164
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,666
Fine.

165
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:51,590
How is work at
the gas station?

166
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,505
Stimulating.

167
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:59,841
I never got a chance
to tell you,

168
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:04,314
but I-I thought your
moving in here with
your brother after...

169
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:06,688
it was a nice thing
to do.

170
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,812
Well, I don't think
I'm helping much.

171
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,068
You are.

172
00:17:33,092 --> 00:17:35,631
Sorry.

173
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,931
Okay, so far I have,
"It was very dark."

174
00:17:40,016 --> 00:17:42,589
Yes, it was.

175
00:17:42,684 --> 00:17:46,517
You can't describe him
at all?

176
00:17:46,606 --> 00:17:49,179
Don't you think
that's kind of odd?

177
00:17:49,275 --> 00:17:52,026
A little.

178
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:56,322
I don't know whether to look
for a giant or a midget.

179
00:17:56,406 --> 00:17:58,445
No, he definitely
wasn't a midget.

180
00:17:58,533 --> 00:18:00,277
Okay.

181
00:18:00,368 --> 00:18:03,986
So he was tall?

182
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,745
I-I would say so, yes.

183
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,411
Probably.

184
00:18:09,501 --> 00:18:11,541
Over 6 feet?

185
00:18:13,672 --> 00:18:15,463
It was very dark.

186
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:17,174
Yes, it was.

187
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:20,463
How certain are you
that this was a male?

188
00:18:20,554 --> 00:18:23,341
Oh, I don't know...
I don't know any girls
who could run like that.

189
00:18:23,432 --> 00:18:24,890
I don't know, Merrill.

190
00:18:24,974 --> 00:18:27,762
I've seen some of those women
on the Olympics.

191
00:18:27,853 --> 00:18:29,679
They can run like
the wind.

192
00:18:29,771 --> 00:18:32,642
This guy got on our roof
in, like, a second.

193
00:18:32,732 --> 00:18:34,689
O-Our roof
is 10 feet high.

194
00:18:34,775 --> 00:18:37,860
They have women's high jumping
in the Olympics.

195
00:18:37,945 --> 00:18:40,234
They got these
Scandinavian women

196
00:18:40,323 --> 00:18:42,149
who can jump clean over me.

197
00:18:45,744 --> 00:18:48,366
Caroline, I know you're
making a point here,

198
00:18:48,455 --> 00:18:50,494
but I just don't know
what it is.

199
00:18:50,582 --> 00:18:53,915
An out-of-town woman stopped by
the diner yesterday afternoon

200
00:18:54,002 --> 00:18:55,876
and started yelling
and cussing

201
00:18:55,962 --> 00:18:58,714
because they didn't have
her favourite cigarettes

202
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:00,921
at the vending machine.

203
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:05,635
She scared a couple
of the customers.

204
00:19:05,721 --> 00:19:08,508
No one's seen her since.

205
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:10,009
And my point is,

206
00:19:10,101 --> 00:19:13,101
we don't know anything
about the person you saw,

207
00:19:13,187 --> 00:19:17,231
and we should just keep
all possibilities available.

208
00:19:17,315 --> 00:19:19,474


209
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:21,276
Dad, where's the remote?

210
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:22,820
I don't know, baby.

211
00:19:22,904 --> 00:19:25,905
Why don't you check
in the sofa cushions?

212
00:19:25,991 --> 00:19:27,568
Excluding the possibility

213
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:29,984
that a female Scandinavian
Olympian

214
00:19:30,078 --> 00:19:33,114
was running around outside
our house last night,

215
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:35,411
what else might be
a possibility?

216
00:19:35,499 --> 00:19:37,657
I'm not done asking
questions,

217
00:19:37,751 --> 00:19:40,242
and I don't appreciate
sarcasm.

218
00:19:42,131 --> 00:19:43,874
Do you two have anyone

219
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:47,334
who might have a grudge
or something against you...

220
00:19:47,427 --> 00:19:48,755
maybe a-a church member

221
00:19:48,846 --> 00:19:50,802
who... who might
not have liked

222
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,724
the fact that
you left the church?

223
00:19:56,311 --> 00:19:58,267
I don't think so.

224
00:19:58,354 --> 00:19:59,813
Okay, I was out of line

225
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:02,305
with the whole female-
Scandinavian-Olympian thing.

226
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,685
It's just,
I'm pretty strong,

227
00:20:05,778 --> 00:20:07,652
and I'm pretty fast.

228
00:20:07,738 --> 00:20:11,237
And I was running
as fast as I could,

229
00:20:11,325 --> 00:20:15,951
and this guy, he was...
he was just toying with us.

230
00:20:16,038 --> 00:20:18,789
There's only food
under the sofa.

231
00:20:18,873 --> 00:20:20,416
Baby, why don't you

232
00:20:20,501 --> 00:20:22,706
just change the channel
on the television?

233
00:20:22,794 --> 00:20:23,742
I did.

234
00:20:23,836 --> 00:20:25,034
And?

235
00:20:25,129 --> 00:20:29,079
Same show's
on every station.

236
00:20:29,175 --> 00:20:32,923
Every station?

237
00:20:35,598 --> 00:20:41,636
GRAHAM:
Bo, turn up the volume.

238
00:20:41,728 --> 00:20:44,100
Crop signs first emerged
in the late '70s

239
00:20:44,189 --> 00:20:46,858
with renewed interest
in extraterrestrial life.

240
00:20:46,941 --> 00:20:50,310
They died out
by the early '80s,

241
00:20:50,403 --> 00:20:52,396
dismissed as hoaxes.

242
00:20:52,489 --> 00:20:55,656
This new resurgence
is wholly different.

243
00:20:55,742 --> 00:20:58,861
The speed and the quantity
in which it has appeared

244
00:20:58,953 --> 00:21:02,073
implies the coordination
of hundreds of individuals

245
00:21:02,164 --> 00:21:03,409
over many countries.

246
00:21:06,794 --> 00:21:10,163
There are only a limited
number of explanations.

247
00:21:10,256 --> 00:21:14,668
Either this is one
of the most elaborate
hoaxes ever created,

248
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:18,258
or basically...

249
00:21:18,346 --> 00:21:21,383
it's for real.

250
00:21:27,147 --> 00:21:30,396
Extraterrestrials.

251
00:21:30,482 --> 00:21:35,274
What in God's name
is going on?

252
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:38,648
I did some research
after I saw your crops.

253
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,904
Two or three guys can make
a design the size of the
one in your field overnight

254
00:21:42,995 --> 00:21:45,367
using just
boards and ropes.

255
00:21:45,455 --> 00:21:46,949
Really?

256
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,290
That's how these things
have been done in the past.

257
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:52,950
But there are
so many now.

258
00:21:53,046 --> 00:21:56,497
How could so many people
be in on it?

259
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:00,260
I can't think straight.

260
00:22:00,344 --> 00:22:02,337
I'm... I'm gonna go back
to the station

261
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:05,181
and have a cup of
Edgar's coffee and...
and try to think clear.

262
00:22:05,265 --> 00:22:07,258
And after that, I'll...

263
00:22:07,351 --> 00:22:09,391
I might make some calls.

264
00:22:09,478 --> 00:22:12,478
But I'll tell you
something... what I said
in there, it still goes.

265
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:14,473
Your... your family
has been through a lot.

266
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:17,816
And the last thing
these children need to do

267
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:21,900
is worry about some crazy
things happening in the world.

268
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,614
Now, take them into town

269
00:22:23,699 --> 00:22:27,650
and get their minds
and your mind on
everyday things, hmm?

270
00:22:27,745 --> 00:22:29,323
Good medicine.

271
00:22:29,413 --> 00:22:32,450
That's good advice.

272
00:22:35,044 --> 00:22:38,293
And you take care
of yourself...

273
00:22:38,381 --> 00:22:40,918
Graham.

274
00:22:50,934 --> 00:22:54,137
The footage you're watching
was shot yesterday afternoon

275
00:22:54,229 --> 00:22:56,386
by a 34-year-old local
cameraman in Bangalore,

276
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,354
a southern city of India.

277
00:22:58,441 --> 00:23:01,014
It's the 18th reported
crop sign

278
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:04,479
found in that country
in the last 72 hours.

279
00:23:06,615 --> 00:23:11,407
Uncle Merrill, will you
turn on the radio?

280
00:23:11,495 --> 00:23:15,077
They are signs intended
to be seen from the sky...

281
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:21,170
No radio either.
Just for a while.

282
00:23:48,112 --> 00:23:50,319
Book money?

283
00:23:50,406 --> 00:23:52,316
Sure.

284
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:57,156
Just one.

285
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:08,125
Be back for pizza
in 15.

286
00:24:11,384 --> 00:24:15,299
CARL: It's just a bunch
of crock.

287
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:19,089
They're trying to sell sodas.
It's plain and simple.

288
00:24:19,184 --> 00:24:21,556
Been watching these reports
since morning.

289
00:24:21,644 --> 00:24:24,100
I have seen 12 soda
commercials so far...

290
00:24:24,188 --> 00:24:26,145
12

291
00:24:26,232 --> 00:24:28,604
You have any books
on extraterrestrials?

292
00:24:28,693 --> 00:24:31,527
Now, don't tell me you believe
this horse manure.

293
00:24:31,612 --> 00:24:34,019
As a matter of fact,
I think we have one.

294
00:24:34,114 --> 00:24:36,107
Came by mistake
in a shipment...

295
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,525
decided to keep it
for the city people.

296
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:42,319
Last row, third book
on the left, honey.

297
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:45,617
MAN ON RADIO: Why is no one
saying the obvious?

298
00:24:45,709 --> 00:24:47,286
These are just copycats.

299
00:24:47,377 --> 00:24:50,128
Someone somewhere does
the first one...

300
00:24:50,212 --> 00:24:53,214
It was asthma medicine,
right, Father?

301
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:54,841
For Morgan Hess.

302
00:24:54,925 --> 00:24:57,381
And it's not "Father"
anymore.

303
00:24:57,469 --> 00:25:00,803
In less than an hour,
a couple hundred people
get the same brilliant idea,

304
00:25:00,889 --> 00:25:06,394
and here we are, on
the verge of mass hysteria.

305
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:13,311
Can I ask you a favour,
Father?

306
00:25:13,402 --> 00:25:16,272
I need to clear
my conscience.

307
00:25:16,362 --> 00:25:18,320
Will you listen to me?

308
00:25:18,406 --> 00:25:22,273
Tracey... I am not
a reverend anymore.

309
00:25:22,368 --> 00:25:25,654
I haven't been
for six months.

310
00:25:25,746 --> 00:25:27,988
You know this.

311
00:25:28,082 --> 00:25:30,240
All this stuff on TV...

312
00:25:30,334 --> 00:25:33,500
two girls came in here
talking about the end
of the world...

313
00:25:33,587 --> 00:25:36,790
I'm just a little scared.


314
00:25:36,882 --> 00:25:41,175
Please, I need to clear
my conscience.

315
00:25:48,225 --> 00:25:51,061
I've got it figured.

316
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:55,477
You do?

317
00:25:55,566 --> 00:25:57,440
I've had two separate
folks tell me

318
00:25:57,526 --> 00:26:00,860
there have been strangers
around these parts
last couple nights.

319
00:26:00,946 --> 00:26:03,105
Can't tell
what they look like

320
00:26:03,198 --> 00:26:06,649
'cause they're staying
in the shadows... covertlike.

321
00:26:06,744 --> 00:26:08,735
Nobody's been hurt,
mind you.

322
00:26:08,828 --> 00:26:10,406
And that's the giveaway.

323
00:26:10,497 --> 00:26:11,955
I see.

324
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,831
It's called "probing."

325
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:15,992
It's a military procedure.

326
00:26:16,085 --> 00:26:18,374
You send out a
reconnaissance group...

327
00:26:18,462 --> 00:26:20,585
very small...
to check things out.

328
00:26:20,673 --> 00:26:24,800
Not to engage but
to evaluate the situation...

329
00:26:24,886 --> 00:26:27,672
evaluate the level
of danger,

330
00:26:27,763 --> 00:26:30,716
make sure things
are all clear.

331
00:26:30,807 --> 00:26:33,844
Clear for what?

332
00:26:33,935 --> 00:26:36,937
For the rest of them.

333
00:26:40,274 --> 00:26:42,018
Yeah?

334
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:45,194
You got a pamphlet or
something I can read?

335
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,150
Sure.

336
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:50,317
Thanks.

337
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:54,821
You didn't used to play
baseball, did ya?

338
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:57,665
Shit, I know you.
You're Merrill Hess.

339
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,750
I was there the day
you hit that 507-footer

340
00:27:00,835 --> 00:27:03,872
over the left-field wall...
set the record.

341
00:27:03,964 --> 00:27:06,253
Man, that thing had
a motor on it.

342
00:27:06,341 --> 00:27:08,380
It's still the record,
right?

343
00:27:08,468 --> 00:27:12,845
Got the bat at home
o-on the wall.

344
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,801
You've got two minor-league
home-run records, don't ya?

345
00:27:15,892 --> 00:27:18,299
Five.

346
00:27:18,394 --> 00:27:20,683
Why weren't you in the pros
making stacks of cash

347
00:27:20,771 --> 00:27:23,144
and getting your toes licked
by beautiful women?

348
00:27:23,232 --> 00:27:26,850
'Cause he has another
record most people
don't know about.

349
00:27:26,944 --> 00:27:29,565
He has the minor-league
strikeout record.

350
00:27:31,698 --> 00:27:33,857
Hello, Lionel.

351
00:27:33,951 --> 00:27:36,406
Merrill's a class-A
screw-up.

352
00:27:36,495 --> 00:27:39,448
He would just swing
that bat as hard as
he could every time.

353
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:41,330
Didn't matter what
the coaches said,

354
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:43,408
didn't matter
who was on base.

355
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,170
He would just whip that
bat through the air
as hard as he could.

356
00:27:46,254 --> 00:27:49,456
Looked like a lumberjack
chopping down a tree.

357
00:27:49,548 --> 00:27:53,463
Merrill here has
more strikeouts than
any two players.

358
00:27:53,552 --> 00:27:56,257
You really got
the strikeout record?

359
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:07,059
Felt wrong not to swing.

360
00:28:18,534 --> 00:28:20,076
It's contaminated.

361
00:28:20,161 --> 00:28:23,826
Carl, there's something wrong
with our water.

362
00:28:23,914 --> 00:28:25,325
Your water's fine.

363
00:28:25,415 --> 00:28:28,500
Bo has this thing
about her drinking water.

364
00:28:28,585 --> 00:28:30,661
She had it
her whole life.

365
00:28:30,753 --> 00:28:34,752
It's like a tick
people have, except
it's not a tick.

366
00:28:34,841 --> 00:28:37,213
Is that right?

TRACE Y: I cursed
37 times last week.

373
00:28:50,481 --> 00:28:55,688
I said the "F" word
a couple times, but
mostly..."shits"

374
00:28:55,777 --> 00:29:00,071
and..."bastards."

375
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:02,991
Is "douche bag"
a curse?

376
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:05,911
I suppose that would
depend on its usage.

377
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:09,280
How about, "John,
you're a douche bag
for kissing Barbara"?

378
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:11,911
It's a curse.

GRAHAM:
It's Bo's baby monitor.

389
00:30:58,017 --> 00:30:59,677
I found it in the basement.

390
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:02,260
I'm gonna use it
as a walkie-talkie.

391
00:31:07,193 --> 00:31:10,893
What if it's catching
a signal from them?

392
00:31:13,741 --> 00:31:15,234
It's not.

393
00:31:15,325 --> 00:31:16,701
But it wasn't working.

394

Morgan, this crop stuff

395
00:31:19,037 --> 00:31:21,873
is about a bunch of nerds
who never had a girlfriend
in their lives.

396
00:31:21,957 --> 00:31:24,448
They're, like, 30, and
they work up little
codes together,

397
00:31:24,543 --> 00:31:27,116
and they analyse Greek
mythology and make up
secret societies

398
00:31:27,212 --> 00:31:29,833
where other guys who
never had girlfriends
before can join in.

399
00:31:29,922 --> 00:31:32,628
They do stupid crap
like this to feel special.

400
00:31:32,717 --> 00:31:33,832
It's a scam.

401
00:31:33,927 --> 00:31:35,835
Nerds were doing it
25 years ago,

402
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:38,170
and new nerds
are doing it again.

403

It's just static, Morgan,
alright.

Turn it up. See.

405

girlfriends?

Maybe some new
batteries...

412
00:32:11,254 --> 00:32:13,246
We might lose the signal.

This is exactly
what the nerds want.

right, Uncle Merrill?

[Exhales sharply]
Give me some comfort.

483
00:41:49,881 --> 00:41:55,919
People break down
into two groups

484
00:41:56,012 --> 00:41:59,049
when they experience
something lucky.

485
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:02,640
Group number one sees
it as more than luck,

486
00:42:02,727 --> 00:42:04,470
more than coincidence.

487
00:42:04,562 --> 00:42:07,812
They see it as a sign...

488
00:42:07,898 --> 00:42:11,516
evidence that there
is someone up there

489
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,603
watching out for them.

490
00:42:13,696 --> 00:42:17,610
Group number two sees
it as just pure luck,

491
00:42:17,699 --> 00:42:19,360
a happy turn of chance.

492
00:42:19,451 --> 00:42:22,405
I'm sure the people
in group number two

493
00:42:22,496 --> 00:42:26,196
are looking at those
14 lights in a very
suspicious way.

494
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:30,502
For them, the situation
isn't 50-50.

495
00:42:30,587 --> 00:42:34,536
Could be bad, could be good.

496
00:42:34,632 --> 00:42:36,292
But deep down,

497
00:42:36,384 --> 00:42:40,132
they feel that
whatever happens,

498
00:42:40,221 --> 00:42:42,546
they're on their own.

499
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,218
And that fills
them with fear.

500
00:42:47,311 --> 00:42:51,771
Yeah,
there are those people.

501
00:42:51,857 --> 00:42:56,565
But there's a whole
lot of people in
the group number one.

502
00:42:56,653 --> 00:42:59,903
When they see
those 14 lights,

503
00:42:59,989 --> 00:43:02,777
they're looking at a miracle.

504
00:43:02,868 --> 00:43:08,407
And deep down, they feel that
whatever's going to happen,

505
00:43:08,497 --> 00:43:12,495
there'll be someone
there to help them.

506
00:43:12,585 --> 00:43:16,036
And that fills
them with hope.

507
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:20,542
See, what you have to
ask yourself is, what
kind of person are you?

508
00:43:20,634 --> 00:43:25,509
Are you the kind who
sees signs, sees miracles?

509
00:43:25,597 --> 00:43:29,760
Or do you believe that
people just get lucky?

510
00:43:29,851 --> 00:43:33,220
Or look at the question
this way...

511
00:43:33,313 --> 00:43:38,651
is it possible that there
are no coincidences?

512
00:43:45,533 --> 00:43:48,154
I was at this party once.

513
00:43:48,243 --> 00:43:51,198
I'm on the couch
with Randa McKinney.

514
00:43:51,288 --> 00:43:53,660
[Exhales sharply]
She was just sitting there

515
00:43:53,749 --> 00:43:57,912
Iooking beautiful,
staring at me.

516
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:00,920
I go to lean in
and kiss her...

517
00:44:01,006 --> 00:44:05,382
... and I realise
I have gum in my mouth.

518
00:44:05,467 --> 00:44:08,173
So I turn,
take out the gum,

519
00:44:08,262 --> 00:44:11,963
stuff it in a paper cup
next to the sofa,

520
00:44:12,058 --> 00:44:13,551
and turn around.

521
00:44:13,642 --> 00:44:17,390
Randa McKinney throws up
all over herself.

522
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:24,232
I knew the second it happened
it was a miracle.

523
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:28,233
I could have been kissing
her when she threw up.

524
00:44:28,322 --> 00:44:31,407
That would have
scarred me for life.

525
00:44:31,493 --> 00:44:35,490
I may never have recovered.

526
00:44:37,498 --> 00:44:40,333
I'm a miracle man.

527
00:44:40,417 --> 00:44:42,789
Those lights are a miracle.

528
00:44:42,878 --> 00:44:46,876
There you go.

529
00:44:46,966 --> 00:44:51,711
So, which type are you?

530
00:44:51,804 --> 00:44:56,511
Do you feel comforted?

531
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,269
Yeah, I do.

532
00:44:59,352 --> 00:45:02,103
Then what does it matter?

533
00:45:09,445 --> 00:45:11,484
I never told you
the last words

534
00:45:11,572 --> 00:45:15,521
that Colleen said
before they let her die.

535
00:45:18,078 --> 00:45:21,577
She said, "See."

536
00:45:21,664 --> 00:45:27,039
Then her eyes glazed a bit.

537
00:45:27,128 --> 00:45:31,339
And then she said,
"Swing away."

538
00:45:31,424 --> 00:45:34,709
You know why she said that?

539
00:45:36,846 --> 00:45:40,760
Because the nerve
endings in her brain
were firing as she died,

540
00:45:40,849 --> 00:45:45,974
and some random memory of us
at one of your baseball games
just popped into her head.

541
00:45:51,985 --> 00:45:56,979
There is no one watching
out for us, Merrill.

542
00:45:57,072 --> 00:45:59,611
We are all on our own.

543
00:46:38,487 --> 00:46:40,729
What do you know?

544
00:46:40,823 --> 00:46:43,444
Well, there was an
accident... drunk driving,
they weren't sure...

545
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:45,360
He wasn't drunk.
Ray fell asleep at the wheel.

546
00:46:45,451 --> 00:46:47,693
...Is he okay?
...Yeah.

547
00:46:47,787 --> 00:46:50,990
That was the first thing
Colleen asked, too.

548
00:46:51,082 --> 00:46:53,371
She's talking.
What ambulance is she in?

549
00:46:53,459 --> 00:46:55,915
She's not in an ambulance,
Father.

550
00:47:41,672 --> 00:47:43,213
For the kids' protection.

551
00:47:43,298 --> 00:47:45,504
All they were doing was
watching TV from 5.00 a.m.

552
00:47:45,592 --> 00:47:48,165
I felt like they were
getting obsessed,
like you said.

553
00:47:48,261 --> 00:47:51,630
They should be playing
furry, furry rabbit or
tea party or something.

554
00:47:51,723 --> 00:47:52,967
What's furry, furry rabbit?

555
00:47:53,057 --> 00:47:54,136
It's a game, isn't it?

556
00:47:54,225 --> 00:47:55,969
Anyways, they closed
the schools.

557
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:58,267
And there's been some
interesting developments.

558
00:47:58,354 --> 00:47:59,813
What time is it?

559
00:47:59,897 --> 00:48:01,521
11.00 a.m.

560
00:48:01,607 --> 00:48:04,691
They're gone, but they're
not really gone.

561
00:48:04,777 --> 00:48:06,319
We just can't see them.

562
00:48:06,403 --> 00:48:08,312
Early this morning,
a bird flew into the area

563
00:48:08,405 --> 00:48:10,730
where the lights were
hovering last night.

564
00:48:10,824 --> 00:48:13,528
It stopped dead in the air
and fell straight down.

565
00:48:13,618 --> 00:48:16,287
They caught it on tape.
They've been playing
it all morning.

566
00:48:16,371 --> 00:48:19,040
The footage looks like
the bird flew into
a wall in the sky.

567
00:48:19,124 --> 00:48:21,496
They found the bird. His...
his head was crushed in.

568
00:48:21,584 --> 00:48:25,249
They think they have some kind
of invisible-shield thing going,
I-like an optical illusion.

569
00:48:25,338 --> 00:48:30,580
They're still there,
hovering.

570
00:48:30,676 --> 00:48:33,843
Some people think there's
more of them now...

571
00:48:33,929 --> 00:48:36,467
all over the place,
over us, even.

572
00:48:36,556 --> 00:48:39,474
There's a theory about
the c... the crop circles.

573
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,011
They could be
some kind of...

574
00:48:43,105 --> 00:48:45,144
some kind of landmark,

575
00:48:45,231 --> 00:48:49,395
visual mapping system
so they could navigate,

576
00:48:49,486 --> 00:48:52,023
coordinate...

577
00:48:52,113 --> 00:48:54,485
makes sense.

578
00:49:07,628 --> 00:49:09,786
MORGAN:
Want to hear a story?

579
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:20,800
BO: Is it true?

580
00:49:23,351 --> 00:49:26,268
So the aliens can't
read our minds.

581
00:49:26,353 --> 00:49:28,725
Oh.

582
00:49:28,814 --> 00:49:30,972
Oh, of course.

583
00:49:36,947 --> 00:49:39,070
They tell you everything
in this book.

584
00:49:39,157 --> 00:49:41,909
It says they're probably
very small, like my height,

585
00:49:41,993 --> 00:49:43,820
because as their
brains develop,

586
00:49:43,912 --> 00:49:46,154
there was no use
for physical development.

587
00:49:46,248 --> 00:49:48,489
It also says they're
probably vegetarians

588
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:51,583
because they would
have realised the
benefits of such a diet.

589
00:49:51,669 --> 00:49:53,127
Who wrote this book?

590
00:49:53,212 --> 00:49:56,130
Scientists who have been
persecuted for their beliefs.

591
00:49:56,215 --> 00:49:57,839
That means
they're unemployed.

592
00:49:57,925 --> 00:50:00,250
If you're gonna make fun
of it, then forget it.

593
00:50:00,343 --> 00:50:02,301
This is serious.

594
00:50:06,266 --> 00:50:09,267
I don't know
what got into me.

595
00:50:09,353 --> 00:50:11,143
There are pictures.

596
00:50:11,229 --> 00:50:13,471
Dr. Bimbu, one of the
authors of the book...

597
00:50:13,564 --> 00:50:14,727
...Bimbu?
...Dad.

598
00:50:14,816 --> 00:50:16,607
I just asked his name.

599
00:50:16,693 --> 00:50:19,479
You had a tone.

600
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:23,318
He said there are two
reasons why extraterrestrials
would visit us...

601
00:50:23,407 --> 00:50:25,779
to make contact in
the spirit of exploration

602
00:50:25,867 --> 00:50:28,323
and furthering the
knowledge of the universe,

603
00:50:28,412 --> 00:50:31,117
or the other reason...
they're hostile.

604
00:50:31,206 --> 00:50:34,575
They've used up all the
resources on their planet,

605
00:50:34,668 --> 00:50:37,289
and they're looking to
harvest our planet next.

606
00:50:39,464 --> 00:50:41,373
Here.

607
00:51:10,326 --> 00:51:13,778
Looks a little like
our house, doesn't it?

608
00:51:13,871 --> 00:51:15,781
Same windows.

609
00:51:15,874 --> 00:51:17,865
That's weird.

610
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:35,635
Yeah, oh, yeah.

611
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:37,848
That's enough from
Dr. Bimbu for now.

612
00:51:37,936 --> 00:51:40,889
Everybody in this house
needs to calm down

613
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,305
and eat some fruit
or something.

614
00:51:43,399 --> 00:51:47,017


615
00:51:47,112 --> 00:51:48,902
Hello?

616
00:51:48,988 --> 00:51:51,064
MAN: Father?

617
00:51:51,157 --> 00:51:53,778
Hello?

618
00:51:53,867 --> 00:51:55,825
Hello?!

619
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:17,469
I'm going out
for a few minutes.

620
00:52:17,557 --> 00:52:19,714
No one leaves this house...
no one.

621
00:52:19,809 --> 00:52:21,386
Where you going?

622
00:52:21,477 --> 00:52:23,719
...Ray Reddy's house.

623
00:52:23,813 --> 00:52:24,975
Why?

624
00:52:25,064 --> 00:52:27,389
I think
he just called here.

625
00:52:27,483 --> 00:52:29,142
[Door opens, slams]

626
00:52:34,739 --> 00:52:38,191
BO: You don't think
something bad will happen,

627
00:52:38,285 --> 00:52:39,909
do you, Morgan?

628
00:52:39,994 --> 00:52:44,288
Why? You have one of
your feelings again?

629
00:52:46,709 --> 00:52:48,452
Is it bad?

630
00:52:50,671 --> 00:52:54,419
I won't let anything bad
happen to you.

631
00:52:54,508 --> 00:52:57,426
I don't want you to die.

632
00:52:57,511 --> 00:53:00,630
Who said I was gonna die?

633
00:53:02,766 --> 00:53:05,173
Who said I was gonna die?

634
00:54:27,429 --> 00:54:29,255
Hello, Ray.

635
00:54:45,279 --> 00:54:47,817
What happened?

636
00:54:47,907 --> 00:54:51,525
I wrote your number
down to call you.

637
00:54:54,412 --> 00:54:57,828
It's been sitting next to
the phone for 6 months.

638
00:55:01,003 --> 00:55:03,671
When I knew it was
inside the house...

639
00:55:03,755 --> 00:55:08,666
I couldn't think of any
other number to call.
I panicked.

640
00:55:08,759 --> 00:55:11,428
Thank you for coming,
Father.

641
00:55:11,512 --> 00:55:14,182
You're welcome, Ray.

642
00:55:14,265 --> 00:55:17,135
I worked so long
that night.

643
00:55:17,226 --> 00:55:21,223
I've never fallen asleep
driving before...

644
00:55:21,313 --> 00:55:22,593
never since.

645
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:23,638
Don't.

646
00:55:23,731 --> 00:55:25,559
Most of the ride home,

647
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:29,600
there wasn't a car in sight
in either direction.

648
00:55:29,696 --> 00:55:32,483
If I'd have
fallen asleep then,

649
00:55:32,574 --> 00:55:36,618
I would have ended up in
a ditch with a headache.

650
00:55:36,702 --> 00:55:40,746
And it had to be at that
right moment...

651
00:55:40,832 --> 00:55:45,374
that 10, 15 seconds when
I passed her walking.

652
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:49,209
It was like
it was meant to be.

653
00:55:57,597 --> 00:56:00,170
I guess if this is
the end of the world,

654
00:56:00,267 --> 00:56:02,389
I'm screwed, right?

655
00:56:02,476 --> 00:56:05,229
People who kill
reverends' wives

656
00:56:05,313 --> 00:56:10,105
aren't exactly ushered
to the front of the
line in Heaven.

657
00:56:11,569 --> 00:56:12,683


658
00:56:12,778 --> 00:56:14,901
Wh... Where
are you going, Ray?

659
00:56:16,532 --> 00:56:19,069
To the lake.

660
00:56:19,159 --> 00:56:22,824
The way I see it...

661
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:25,830
these places marked
in crops and such...

662
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:28,489
none of them are
really near water.

663
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:32,664
I don't think
they like water.

664
00:56:32,755 --> 00:56:35,756
Can't be any worse
than here.

665
00:56:35,842 --> 00:56:39,625
Did you see something, Ray?

666
00:56:41,013 --> 00:56:43,053
I know what I've
done to you.

667
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:45,382
I made you question
your faith.

668
00:56:47,853 --> 00:56:52,181
I'm truly sorry for what
I've done to you and yours.

669
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:03,657
Alright.

670
00:57:06,078 --> 00:57:08,036
And don't open
my pantry, Father.

671
00:57:08,122 --> 00:57:10,791
I found one of them in
there and locked him in.

672
00:57:20,425 --> 00:57:23,212
WOMAN ON TV:
The startling footage
we're about to show you

673
00:57:23,303 --> 00:57:25,675
was photographed by a
42-year-old, Romero Valadarez.

674
00:57:25,763 --> 00:57:27,637
This video was taken
yesterday afternoon

675
00:57:27,724 --> 00:57:29,301
at his son's 7 th birthday

676
00:57:29,392 --> 00:57:31,017
in the city of
Passo Fundo, Brazil.

677
00:57:31,102 --> 00:57:33,558
It was sent to the local
news bureau there

678
00:57:33,646 --> 00:57:36,563
and sent to us via satellite
just a few minutes ago.

679
00:57:36,649 --> 00:57:39,899
All initial opinions are
this is genuine.

680
00:57:39,985 --> 00:57:43,189
What you're about to see
may disturb you.

681
00:58:25,695 --> 00:58:27,154
Oh!

682
00:59:25,876 --> 00:59:27,704
Hello?

683
00:59:35,594 --> 00:59:38,879
The police are here.
I am with them.

684
00:59:38,972 --> 00:59:41,179
I am a police officer.

685
00:59:43,268 --> 00:59:47,135
I just want to
talk with you.

686
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:50,646
We know all about the hoax.

687
00:59:50,734 --> 00:59:54,778
We already took some of
your friends downtown
in a paddy waggon.

688
01:00:00,034 --> 01:00:03,237
Just tell us your name
and why you did it,

689
01:00:03,328 --> 01:00:07,160
and we'll give you the same
deal we gave the others.

690
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:09,918
Don't throw your
life away, son.

691
01:01:39,586 --> 01:01:41,495
Oh! Ah!

692
01:01:41,587 --> 01:01:43,379
Oh!

693
01:02:23,211 --> 01:02:24,954
Their skin changes colours.

694
01:02:25,045 --> 01:02:28,000
That's why we couldn't
see them that night.

695
01:02:30,008 --> 01:02:32,131
Tell me something, Morgan.

696
01:02:32,219 --> 01:02:34,840
Uh... in this
book of yours...

697
01:02:34,929 --> 01:02:37,006
did they happen to detail

698
01:02:37,098 --> 01:02:40,432
what would happen
if they were hostile?

699
01:02:40,518 --> 01:02:42,310
Yes.

700
01:02:42,396 --> 01:02:44,636
It said they would
probably invade.

701
01:02:44,731 --> 01:02:48,099
They would use
ground tactics...
hand-to-hand combat.

702
01:02:48,192 --> 01:02:51,977
They wouldn't use our
technology or fight
an airborne battle

703
01:02:52,071 --> 01:02:55,486
'cause they know eventually
we would use nuclear weapons.

704
01:02:55,575 --> 01:02:58,112
Then the planet would
be useless to them.

705
01:02:58,202 --> 01:03:02,330
How could anyone possibly
know that information?
It's ridiculous.

706
01:03:02,414 --> 01:03:03,872
What else did it say?

707
01:03:03,957 --> 01:03:07,077
They said there are one of
two outcomes of an invasion.

708
01:03:07,168 --> 01:03:10,703
One, they fight
and are defeated and
have to return again

709
01:03:10,797 --> 01:03:14,711
with full forces
hundreds, maybe even
thousands, of years later.

710
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,885
What's two?

711
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:21,174
They win.

712
01:03:21,265 --> 01:03:25,594
I'm sorry, what...
what book is this?

713
01:03:25,686 --> 01:03:28,853
Is this really
happening?

714
01:03:32,567 --> 01:03:34,726
I heard a theory that,
uh,

715
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:37,441
they don't like
places near water.

716
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:41,480
Maybe we'd be safe from them
near a lake or something.

717
01:03:41,576 --> 01:03:44,328
Sounds made-up.

718
01:03:53,379 --> 01:03:56,545
I saw one of them
at Ray Reddy's house.

719
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:58,375
I can't be sure,

720
01:03:58,466 --> 01:04:01,670
but I got the distinct feeling
he wanted to harm me.

721
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:05,428
So...

722
01:04:05,515 --> 01:04:10,676
we can choose to believe this
lake idea, pack up, and go,

723
01:04:10,771 --> 01:04:15,765
or we can stay here, hide
inside our home, wait it out.

724
01:04:15,858 --> 01:04:21,232
We might be overreacting, but
I'm willing to live with that.

725
01:04:21,321 --> 01:04:24,655
Either way, at least
we'll be together.

726
01:04:24,742 --> 01:04:29,238
All those in favour of
the lake idea, raise your hand.

727
01:04:31,748 --> 01:04:34,868
Yeah.

728
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:38,162
All those in favour of home,
raise your hand.

729
01:04:42,884 --> 01:04:44,377
Okay.

730
01:04:44,468 --> 01:04:46,342
My vote counts as two.

731
01:04:46,429 --> 01:04:48,053
That's bullshit!
You're cheating!

732
01:04:48,138 --> 01:04:49,847
Morgan, calm down.

733
01:04:49,932 --> 01:04:51,758
I get two votes because
I represent two parents here.

734
01:04:51,851 --> 01:04:54,139
We don't know anything yet.

735
01:04:54,227 --> 01:04:56,434
We'll be safe here anyway.

736
01:04:56,521 --> 01:04:58,810
I don't want to leave home.

737
01:04:58,898 --> 01:05:01,853
This is where
we lived with Mom.

738
01:05:01,944 --> 01:05:04,612
That's got nothing
to do with this.

739
01:05:04,696 --> 01:05:06,938
I change my vote.

740
01:05:07,031 --> 01:05:08,442
You can't change your vote.

741
01:05:08,533 --> 01:05:12,067
All those in favour of home,
raise your hand.

742
01:05:12,161 --> 01:05:14,367
This is ridiculous.

743
01:05:14,455 --> 01:05:17,206
You lose, 3-2.

744
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:37,182
We're going to board up
every window in this house.

745
01:05:37,268 --> 01:05:40,886
How do we know boards
will do anything?

746
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:45,606
Because they seem to have
trouble with pantry doors.

747
01:06:49,044 --> 01:06:51,333
MAN ON TV:
The information we're receiving

748
01:06:51,421 --> 01:06:53,793
comes from our affiliates
across the world.

749
01:06:53,882 --> 01:06:57,333
Dad, Uncle Merrill!

750
01:07:00,138 --> 01:07:04,349
Amman joins Nairobi,
Beijing, and Jerusalem

751
01:07:04,434 --> 01:07:09,226
as the latest to confirm
the appearance of lights.

752
01:07:09,313 --> 01:07:12,564
There are lights
in over 274 cities.

753
01:07:12,650 --> 01:07:16,233
They think it'll be
400 within the hour.

754
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:20,899
They're appearing at or within
one mile of crop signs.

755
01:07:20,991 --> 01:07:23,149
They were for navigation.

756
01:07:23,244 --> 01:07:25,531
They made a map.

757
01:07:25,621 --> 01:07:29,618
They're gonna be
within a mile of us.

758
01:07:29,708 --> 01:07:31,499
Dad?

759
01:07:31,584 --> 01:07:33,209
Yes?

760
01:07:33,294 --> 01:07:35,832
They think
these are staged

761
01:07:35,922 --> 01:07:39,622
immediately preceding
an attack manoeuvre.

762
01:07:39,717 --> 01:07:44,011
I was wrong.
They're hostile.

763
01:07:46,849 --> 01:07:49,969
It's like "War of the Worlds."

764
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:51,803
MAN ON TV: Ground forces
have been assembled

765
01:07:51,895 --> 01:07:54,766
in countries
throughout the globe.

766
01:07:56,024 --> 01:07:57,400
Hundreds of thousands

767
01:07:57,484 --> 01:08:00,401
have flocked to temples,
synagogues, and churches.

768
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:10,152
God be with us all.

769
01:08:22,257 --> 01:08:24,629
I'm going to get back
to the windows.

770
01:08:34,185 --> 01:08:37,020
Hey, you guys okay?

771
01:08:37,105 --> 01:08:41,813
Some guy had a sign saying
it was the end of the world.

772
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:44,652
Don't worry.

773
01:08:44,737 --> 01:08:47,939
You won't let anything
happen to us, right?

774
01:08:48,032 --> 01:08:49,691
No way.

775
01:08:52,119 --> 01:08:54,360
I wish you were my dad.

776
01:08:54,454 --> 01:08:56,992
What did you say?

777
01:08:57,082 --> 01:09:00,415
Don't you ever say anything
like that again.

778
01:09:00,502 --> 01:09:02,244
Ever.

779
01:09:39,371 --> 01:09:41,495
There's too many windows
in the bedrooms.

780
01:09:41,582 --> 01:09:43,124
We don't have enough
boards.

781
01:09:43,208 --> 01:09:45,000
We'll board up
the bedroom doors.

782
01:09:45,085 --> 01:09:46,496
Where are we
gonna sleep?

783
01:09:46,587 --> 01:09:47,867
In the family room.

784
01:09:47,963 --> 01:09:49,670
What about Isabel?

785
01:09:49,757 --> 01:09:53,041
We'll tie her up in the garage
after dinner.

786
01:09:53,134 --> 01:09:55,044
I'll make some sandwiches.

787
01:09:55,136 --> 01:09:56,927
I want spaghetti.

788
01:09:57,014 --> 01:09:59,421
We'll just eat fast, Bo.

789
01:09:59,516 --> 01:10:01,804
Spaghetti sounds great.

790
01:10:01,893 --> 01:10:04,384
What do you want, Morgan?

791
01:10:04,479 --> 01:10:07,148
Anything?

792
01:10:07,231 --> 01:10:09,722
French toast...

793
01:10:09,817 --> 01:10:12,438
and mashed potatoes.

794
01:10:12,527 --> 01:10:14,401
Now we're talking.

795
01:10:14,488 --> 01:10:16,860
How about you, Merrill?

796
01:10:19,451 --> 01:10:22,571
Chicken teriyaki.

797
01:10:22,663 --> 01:10:25,497
Good choice.

798
01:10:25,582 --> 01:10:29,365
I'm going to have
a cheeseburger with bacon.

799
01:10:31,045 --> 01:10:35,791
Extra bacon.

800
01:10:59,322 --> 01:11:02,525
What's the matter
with everyone? Eat.

801
01:11:02,617 --> 01:11:04,609
Maybe we should say
a prayer.

802
01:11:04,701 --> 01:11:05,650
No.

803
01:11:05,744 --> 01:11:06,859
Why not?

804
01:11:06,954 --> 01:11:09,030
We're not saying a prayer.

805
01:11:09,123 --> 01:11:10,830
Bo has a bad feeling.

806
01:11:10,916 --> 01:11:12,292
I had a dream.

807
01:11:12,376 --> 01:11:15,163
We aren't saying a prayer.

808
01:11:15,253 --> 01:11:16,747
Eat!

809
01:11:16,838 --> 01:11:18,083
I hate you.

810
01:11:19,674 --> 01:11:21,299
That's fine.

811
01:11:21,384 --> 01:11:22,842
You let Mom die.

812
01:11:22,927 --> 01:11:24,552
Morgan.

813
01:11:27,681 --> 01:11:31,466
I am not wasting one more minute
of my life on prayer.

814
01:11:31,561 --> 01:11:34,052
Not one more minute.

815
01:11:34,147 --> 01:11:35,475
Understood?

816
01:11:37,107 --> 01:11:39,065
Now we are going
to enjoy this meal.

817
01:11:39,151 --> 01:11:41,986
No one can stop us from enjoying
this meal, so enjoy it!

818
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:44,110
...Stop crying!

819
01:11:44,197 --> 01:11:46,439
...Graham...
...Don't yell at her!

820
01:11:46,533 --> 01:11:48,110


821
01:11:48,201 --> 01:11:50,359
Alright, since you're
all not gonna eat.

822
01:11:50,453 --> 01:11:52,695
I'm gonna try
some of everything.

823
01:13:06,275 --> 01:13:08,481
It's happening.

824
01:13:38,388 --> 01:13:40,594
Graham, hurry.

825
01:14:04,913 --> 01:14:07,321
Did I ever tell you
what everyone said

826
01:14:07,415 --> 01:14:09,289
when you were born, Bo?

827
01:14:13,046 --> 01:14:16,213
You came out of your mama,
and you didn't even cry.

828
01:14:16,299 --> 01:14:17,924
You just opened your eyes,

829
01:14:18,009 --> 01:14:20,796
and you looked around
the room at everybody.

830
01:14:20,886 --> 01:14:24,090
[Chuckles] Your eyes
were so big and gorgeous.

831
01:14:24,181 --> 01:14:27,218
All the ladies in the room
just gasped.

832
01:14:27,310 --> 01:14:29,765
I mean,
they literally gasped.

833
01:14:29,854 --> 01:14:33,637
And they go,
"Oh, she's like an angel."

834
01:14:33,732 --> 01:14:38,145
And they said, "We've never
seen a baby so beautiful."

835
01:14:38,237 --> 01:14:41,653
And then... you know
what happened?

836
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:45,784
They put you on the table
to clean you up,

837
01:14:45,869 --> 01:14:49,736
and you looked up at me
and you smiled.

838
01:14:51,958 --> 01:14:55,871
They say babies that young
can't smile.

839
01:14:55,961 --> 01:14:58,037
You smiled.

840
01:15:00,132 --> 01:15:02,623
Let's go down now.

841
01:15:21,944 --> 01:15:26,191
We forgot Isabel.

842
01:16:04,901 --> 01:16:08,151
Should we turn off
the lights?

843
01:16:08,238 --> 01:16:11,405
They already know
we're here.

844
01:17:05,541 --> 01:17:08,377
Dad...

845
01:17:18,804 --> 01:17:22,054
Do you know what happened
when you were born, Morgan?

846
01:17:22,141 --> 01:17:24,810
You came out, and your mama
kept bleeding,

847
01:17:24,893 --> 01:17:27,466
so the doctors rushed you
out of the room

848
01:17:27,563 --> 01:17:29,804
before I even had time
to see you.

849
01:17:29,898 --> 01:17:31,689

850
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:33,851
They're on the roof.

851
01:17:33,944 --> 01:17:35,900
While they
were fixing her up,

852
01:17:35,988 --> 01:17:38,145
all she kept asking about
was you.

853
01:17:39,824 --> 01:17:41,698
They're in the house.

854
01:17:41,784 --> 01:17:44,987
I wanted your mama
to see you first

855
01:17:45,079 --> 01:17:49,242
because she had dreamt
about you her whole life.

856
01:17:49,334 --> 01:17:52,250
Then she got feeling better,
they brought you in,

857
01:17:52,336 --> 01:17:54,376
and they placed you
in her arms,

858
01:17:54,463 --> 01:17:58,081
and she looked at you,
and you looked at her,

859
01:17:58,175 --> 01:18:02,468
and you just stared at each
other for the longest time.

860
01:18:02,553 --> 01:18:04,712
And then she said real soft,

861
01:18:04,806 --> 01:18:09,633
"Hello, Morgan.
I'm your mama.

862
01:18:09,727 --> 01:18:12,265
You look
just how I dreamt."

863
01:18:31,664 --> 01:18:34,156
MERRILL: The attic door.

864
01:18:36,711 --> 01:18:37,909
Let's go.

865
01:18:38,004 --> 01:18:39,202
Come on.

866
01:18:53,561 --> 01:18:56,312
We forgot
our foil helmets.

867
01:18:56,396 --> 01:18:58,638
Have we got anything to wedge
against the door knob?

868
01:18:58,732 --> 01:18:59,847
They'll read our minds.

869
01:18:59,941 --> 01:19:01,104
You're scaring
your sister.

870
01:19:01,193 --> 01:19:03,269
I'm already scared.

871
01:19:06,531 --> 01:19:08,073
Merrill.

872
01:19:08,158 --> 01:19:09,486
I'm looking!

873
01:19:09,576 --> 01:19:10,738
They'll know
our secret thoughts.

874
01:19:26,049 --> 01:19:29,465
I'm not ready.

875
01:19:29,552 --> 01:19:30,927
Merrill!

876
01:19:31,013 --> 01:19:32,471
Got it!

877
01:19:32,556 --> 01:19:35,556
...[Light bulb shatters]
...Dad!

878
01:20:05,503 --> 01:20:08,623
Where's Bo?

879
01:20:16,388 --> 01:20:19,009
I'm okay.

880
01:20:49,044 --> 01:20:51,167
What's happening out there?

881
01:20:51,255 --> 01:20:53,876
I can't even imagine.

882
01:20:53,965 --> 01:20:57,251
I hope they're doing better
than we are.

883
01:20:57,344 --> 01:21:00,297
We don't even have helmets.

884
01:21:00,388 --> 01:21:02,926


885
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:18,479
They're only making noises.
They're not trying to get in.

886
01:21:18,572 --> 01:21:20,481
Why would they do that?

887
01:21:20,574 --> 01:21:23,147
They want our attention
on the door?

888
01:21:25,453 --> 01:21:26,533
They're distracting us.

889
01:21:26,621 --> 01:21:28,115
From what?

890
01:21:28,206 --> 01:21:30,958
The book says they're probably
very good problem solvers.

891
01:21:31,042 --> 01:21:34,457
They'll find a way in.

892
01:21:34,546 --> 01:21:37,996


893
01:21:38,090 --> 01:21:40,248
Morgan,
give me your flashlight.

894
01:21:46,932 --> 01:21:50,265
They used to pour coal
down in this basement.

895
01:21:50,352 --> 01:21:52,676
There's a coal chute
in here.

896
01:22:06,117 --> 01:22:08,786
I can feel air.

897
01:22:08,869 --> 01:22:10,778
Me too!

898
01:22:10,872 --> 01:22:12,531
It's getting stronger.

899
01:22:12,623 --> 01:22:14,081
I'm close.

900
01:22:21,589 --> 01:22:26,168
[Wind whistling]

901
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:27,505
What?

902
01:22:28,971 --> 01:22:30,216
Hold him!

903
01:22:30,307 --> 01:22:31,587
I got him!

904
01:22:31,683 --> 01:22:32,928
Hold him!

905
01:22:33,017 --> 01:22:34,298
I got him!

906
01:22:34,393 --> 01:22:35,638
Hold him!

907
01:23:33,366 --> 01:23:35,738
We don't have
his medicine.

908
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,866
Don't be afraid, Morgan.

909
01:23:42,958 --> 01:23:45,449
We'll slow this down
together.

910
01:23:45,544 --> 01:23:47,086
Feel my chest.

911
01:23:47,170 --> 01:23:50,040
Feel it moving
in and out.

912
01:23:50,131 --> 01:23:51,839
Breathe like me.

913
01:23:51,925 --> 01:23:53,632
Breathe like me.

914
01:23:53,718 --> 01:23:55,426
Come on.

915
01:23:55,512 --> 01:23:57,884
I dreamt this.

916
01:23:57,972 --> 01:23:59,300
Stay with me.

917
01:23:59,390 --> 01:24:02,510
I know it hurts.
Be strong, baby.

918
01:24:02,602 --> 01:24:05,685
It'll pass.

919
01:24:05,771 --> 01:24:08,807
It'll pass.

920
01:24:24,164 --> 01:24:27,995
Don't do this to me
again.

921
01:24:28,084 --> 01:24:30,123
Not again.

922
01:24:34,256 --> 01:24:37,921
I hate you.

923
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:40,252
I hate you.

924
01:24:43,974 --> 01:24:46,014
The fear is feeding him.

925
01:24:46,101 --> 01:24:49,386
Don't be afraid
of what's happening.

926
01:24:49,478 --> 01:24:52,978
Believe it's going to pass.
Believe it.

927
01:24:53,065 --> 01:24:57,229
Just wait.
Don't be afraid.

928
01:24:57,320 --> 01:25:01,483
The air is coming.
Believe.

929
01:25:01,573 --> 01:25:03,696
We don't have to be afraid.

930
01:25:03,784 --> 01:25:06,322
It's about to pass.

931
01:25:06,411 --> 01:25:10,705
Here it comes.
Don't be afraid.

932
01:25:10,791 --> 01:25:13,827
Here comes the air.

933
01:25:22,302 --> 01:25:24,674
Don't be afraid, Morgan.

934
01:25:24,763 --> 01:25:28,095
Feel my chest.
Breathe with me.

935
01:25:28,182 --> 01:25:32,262
Together. The air
is going in our lungs.

936
01:25:32,353 --> 01:25:34,891
Together.

937
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:38,515
We're the same.

938
01:25:38,609 --> 01:25:40,732
We're the same.

939
01:25:42,821 --> 01:25:44,943
[Exhales deeply]

940
01:25:51,413 --> 01:25:55,161
We should save
the flashlights.

941
01:26:07,844 --> 01:26:10,715
CAROLINE: Ray's truck
swerved off the road

942
01:26:10,806 --> 01:26:14,221
and hit Colleen
and then a tree,

943
01:26:14,309 --> 01:26:17,974
and she was pinned
between the two.

944
01:26:18,063 --> 01:26:21,265
What does that mean...
pinned?

945
01:26:21,357 --> 01:26:22,732
The truck...

946
01:26:22,817 --> 01:26:26,518
the truck has severed
most of her lower half.

947
01:26:26,612 --> 01:26:28,071
What did you say?

948
01:26:28,155 --> 01:26:31,322
She won't be saved.

949
01:26:31,409 --> 01:26:34,658
Her body is pinned
in such a way

950
01:26:34,744 --> 01:26:38,873
that it's alive when it
shouldn't be alive,

951
01:26:38,957 --> 01:26:42,705
and the truck is
holding her together.

952
01:26:42,794 --> 01:26:44,169
And she doesn't feel much,

953
01:26:44,254 --> 01:26:46,744
and she's... she's talking
almost like normal,

954
01:26:46,839 --> 01:26:48,666
and we didn't
pull the truck out

955
01:26:48,758 --> 01:26:51,166
'cause we... we wanted you
to come down here

956
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:55,590
and be with her
as long as she's awake.

957
01:26:55,682 --> 01:26:59,300
And that won't be very long.

958
01:26:59,393 --> 01:27:03,770
Now, Father, do you understand
what I've told you?

959
01:27:05,899 --> 01:27:08,817
Caroline...

960
01:27:08,902 --> 01:27:11,819
is this the last time I'm
gonna talk with my wife?

961
01:27:11,905 --> 01:27:15,238
Yes, it is.

962
01:27:38,263 --> 01:27:40,303
MAN ON RADIO:
People think they came here
to take over the planet.

963
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:43,889
That's bull.
I don't think that.

964
01:27:43,977 --> 01:27:46,468
My friend and I saw them.

01:27:46,563 --> 01:27:49,184
...I found a pack
of light bulbs.

966
01:27:49,273 --> 01:27:52,060
They poisoned his family.
They dragged them away.

967
01:27:54,611 --> 01:27:56,818
Nobody believes it,
but they didn't come here
for our planet.

968
01:27:56,905 --> 01:27:58,316
This is a raid.

969
01:27:58,406 --> 01:28:01,573
They came here for us,
to harvest us.

970
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:08,330
We're lucky as hell
they're leaving here.

971
01:28:08,417 --> 01:28:10,243
They're leaving?

972
01:28:10,335 --> 01:28:12,623
That's what they're saying.

973
01:28:14,714 --> 01:28:16,837
How long
have we been sleeping?

974
01:28:16,925 --> 01:28:18,300
12 hours or so.

975
01:28:20,052 --> 01:28:24,264
He said
they had poison gas...

976
01:28:24,348 --> 01:28:28,559
they secrete
in small amounts.

977
01:28:28,643 --> 01:28:31,431
A lot of people died.

978
01:28:31,522 --> 01:28:32,980
But they're leaving.

979
01:28:33,065 --> 01:28:34,856
They left real fast
this morning,

980
01:28:34,942 --> 01:28:36,934
like something
scared them off.

981
01:28:37,026 --> 01:28:39,517
They left some
of their wounded behind.

982
01:28:43,450 --> 01:28:45,027
Why are they going?

983
01:28:45,118 --> 01:28:49,067
People must have figured out
a way to beat them.

984
01:28:49,163 --> 01:28:52,034
Everyone has a weakness,
right?

985
01:28:58,839 --> 01:29:02,457
You didn't think we'd make it
through the night, did you?

986
01:29:04,428 --> 01:29:05,886
No.

987
01:29:08,849 --> 01:29:10,805
Listen...

988
01:29:10,892 --> 01:29:15,518
there's things I can take
and a couple things I can't.

989
01:29:15,604 --> 01:29:19,816
One of them I can't take
is when my older brother,

990
01:29:19,901 --> 01:29:22,818
who's everything
I want to be...

991
01:29:22,903 --> 01:29:25,774
starts losing faith
in things.

992
01:29:27,908 --> 01:29:30,031
I saw your eyes last night.

993
01:29:30,118 --> 01:29:34,199
I don't want to ever see
your eyes like that again.

994
01:29:34,289 --> 01:29:38,582
Okay?
I'm serious.

995
01:29:42,672 --> 01:29:44,296
Okay.

996
01:29:49,636 --> 01:29:52,472
He's been like that
for a while.

997
01:29:52,556 --> 01:29:56,554
He needs his medicine.

998
01:29:56,643 --> 01:29:59,561
Have they said anything
about our area?

999
01:29:59,647 --> 01:30:03,430
Philadelphia and its outlying
counties are cleared...

1000
01:30:03,525 --> 01:30:06,194
but who knows for sure?

1001
01:30:06,277 --> 01:30:08,519
He's not strong enough.

1002
01:30:08,613 --> 01:30:10,771
If he has another attack
right now...

1003
01:30:10,865 --> 01:30:13,866
I know.

1004
01:30:13,951 --> 01:30:18,163
We'd have to be sure before
we opened up that door, Graham.

1005
01:30:42,145 --> 01:30:43,722
It's good enough for me.

1006
01:30:43,813 --> 01:30:44,762
Me too.

1007
01:31:51,377 --> 01:31:52,918
Get the syringes' well.

1008
01:31:53,003 --> 01:31:56,123
We may need to give him
an epinephrine shot.

1009
01:32:18,485 --> 01:32:21,688
MAN ON TV:
The atmosphere here is
cautiously optimistic.

1010
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:24,353
...They're doing this on TV.
...People are celebrating.

1011
01:32:24,449 --> 01:32:26,276
There's a great sense
of relief.

1012
01:32:26,368 --> 01:32:28,277
...They're dancing.
...Yeah, like this.

1013
01:32:28,369 --> 01:32:30,741
As we begin evaluating
the loss of life,

1014
01:32:30,830 --> 01:32:34,329
...Do you want to see it?
...we will be left with
a lot of questions.

1015
01:32:34,417 --> 01:32:38,285
...I'll bring the TV in here.
...I see the same expression
on every face.

1016
01:32:38,379 --> 01:32:41,131
We know the battle turned
around in the Middle East.

1017
01:32:41,215 --> 01:32:44,833
Three small cities there
found a primitive method
to defeat them.

1018
01:32:44,927 --> 01:32:47,133
We have no further details
at this time.

1019
01:34:20,267 --> 01:34:24,929
Hi, sweetie.

1020
01:34:25,022 --> 01:34:27,310
Hi, baby.

1021
01:34:27,399 --> 01:34:33,353
I was... just taking a walk
before dinner.

1022
01:34:33,446 --> 01:34:36,151
You love walks.

1023
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:39,490
It was meant to be.

1024
01:34:39,577 --> 01:34:41,984
Does it hurt?

1025
01:34:42,079 --> 01:34:44,071
I don't feel much.

1026
01:34:44,165 --> 01:34:46,073
Good.

1027
01:34:53,256 --> 01:34:55,415
[Voice breaking]
Tell Morgan...

1028
01:34:55,508 --> 01:34:57,086
to play games.

1029
01:34:57,176 --> 01:34:59,003
It's okay to be silly.

1030
01:34:59,095 --> 01:35:01,088
[Voice breaking]
I will.

1031
01:35:01,181 --> 01:35:04,216
Tell Bo to listen
to her brother.

1032
01:35:04,308 --> 01:35:07,095
He'll always take care
of her.

1033
01:35:07,186 --> 01:35:08,217
I will.

1034
01:35:08,312 --> 01:35:10,435
And tell Graham...

1035
01:35:10,522 --> 01:35:12,598
I'm here.

1036
01:35:12,691 --> 01:35:14,980
Tell him...

1037
01:35:15,068 --> 01:35:17,145
see.

1038
01:35:17,237 --> 01:35:20,107
Tell him to see.

1039
01:35:23,826 --> 01:35:26,863
And tell Merrill
to swing away.

1040
01:35:31,418 --> 01:35:35,711
See, what you have to ask
yourself is, what kind
of person are you?

1041
01:35:35,796 --> 01:35:39,628
Are you the kind that sees
signs, sees miracles?

1042
01:35:39,716 --> 01:35:44,461
Or do you believe that
people just get lucky?

1043
01:35:44,554 --> 01:35:51,517
Is it possible...
there are no coincidences?

1044
01:36:17,586 --> 01:36:20,159
Swing away, Merrill.

1045
01:36:22,257 --> 01:36:24,214
Merrill...

1046
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:26,459
swing away.

1047
01:38:22,704 --> 01:38:26,866
GRAHAM:
That's why he had asthma.

1048
01:38:31,295 --> 01:38:32,705
It can't be luck.

1049
01:38:32,796 --> 01:38:35,999
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.

1050
01:38:36,091 --> 01:38:38,760
No poison got in.
No poison got in.

1051
01:38:38,843 --> 01:38:42,177
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.

1052
01:38:42,263 --> 01:38:45,015
Don't touch him.
Give him a minute.

1053
01:38:47,226 --> 01:38:49,433
Graham...

1054
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:51,892
Give him a second.

1055
01:38:51,981 --> 01:38:53,356
D-Daddy...

1056
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:54,900
Don't touch him.

1057
01:38:58,070 --> 01:38:59,731
Graham...

1058
01:39:02,658 --> 01:39:07,320
Don't... don't.

1059
01:39:07,412 --> 01:39:10,448
MORGAN: Dad?

1060
01:39:10,541 --> 01:39:12,367
What happened?

1061
01:39:22,051 --> 01:39:25,218
Did someone save me?

1062
01:39:26,889 --> 01:39:30,223
Yeah, baby,
I think someone did.
