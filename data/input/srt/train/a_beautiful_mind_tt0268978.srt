Professor Nash?

1433
02:00:23,960 --> 02:00:26,713
- Can you see him?
- Yeah.

1434
02:00:26,796 --> 02:00:28,131
- You sure?
- [Giggles] Yes.

1435
02:00:28,214 --> 02:00:30,425
Positive? He's within your vision?

1436
02:00:31,009 --> 02:00:32,385
[Laughing] Okay. Good.

1437
02:00:32,510 --> 02:00:35,305
Forgive me,
I'm just always suspicious of new people.

1438
02:00:35,388 --> 02:00:38,224
- See you next week, Professor.
- See you next week.

1439
02:00:39,017 --> 02:00:43,271
So now that I know that you're real,
who are you, and what can I do for you?

1440
02:00:43,938 --> 02:00:46,441
Professor, my name is Thomas King.

1441
02:00:46,524 --> 02:00:47,650
Thomas King?

1442
02:00:47,734 --> 02:00:52,071
I'm here to tell you that you're being
considered for the Nobel Prize.

1443
02:01:00,455 --> 02:01:02,665
JOHN: Forgive me,
but I'm just a little stunned.

1444
02:01:02,749 --> 02:01:06,169
KING: Over the past years, your
equilibrium has become a cornerstone...

1445
02:01:06,252 --> 02:01:07,920
...of modern economics.

1446
02:01:08,004 --> 02:01:10,173
Suddenly everybody likes that one.

1447
02:01:10,256 --> 02:01:14,510
What about my work on other some
such projects like manifold embedding?

1448
02:01:14,844 --> 02:01:18,181
The application
of your bargaining problem...

1449
02:01:18,431 --> 02:01:22,352
...to FCC bandwidth auctions
or to antitrust cases...

1450
02:01:22,435 --> 02:01:23,895
- Antitrust cases?
- Yes.

1451
02:01:23,978 --> 02:01:26,230
I never would have considered that.

1452
02:01:26,731 --> 02:01:31,194
Have I just reached some level of honesty
that borders on stupidity?

1453
02:01:31,486 --> 02:01:35,074
KING: [Laughs] No, you haven't.
JOHN: I wouldn't have thought of that.

1454
02:01:40,454 --> 02:01:41,956
Shall we have tea?

1455
02:01:44,083 --> 02:01:48,170
I don't go in there.
I usually take my sandwich in the library.

1456
02:01:49,338 --> 02:01:52,383
Come on, John. Let's have some tea.
It's a big day.

1457
02:01:53,092 --> 02:01:58,555
Most commercially available brands of tea
are not suitable to my palate.

1458
02:01:58,639 --> 02:01:59,807
I'm not...

1459
02:02:00,182 --> 02:02:03,686
There are some Northern Indian teas
which are dense enough...

1460
02:02:03,769 --> 02:02:07,648
I enjoy the flavor that they have.
I have not been in this room...

1461
02:02:07,731 --> 02:02:10,818
...for quite some many years.
I wonder what tea they serve.

1462
02:02:12,903 --> 02:02:14,697
JOHN: Why, thank you, young lady.

1463
02:02:16,573 --> 02:02:20,452
Things have certainly changed around here.
I have a son that age.

1464
02:02:22,246 --> 02:02:23,330
Harvard.

1465
02:02:28,419 --> 02:02:29,253
JOHN: Hmm.

1466
02:02:29,336 --> 02:02:34,550
I would have thought the nominations
for the Nobel Prize would've been secret.

1467
02:02:35,050 --> 02:02:38,512
I would have thought you'd only find out
if you won or lost.

1468
02:02:38,762 --> 02:02:42,683
That is generally the case, yes,
but these are special circumstances.

1469
02:02:44,310 --> 02:02:46,103
The awards are substantial.

1470
02:02:46,729 --> 02:02:49,815
They require private funding as such...

1471
02:02:51,234 --> 02:02:53,361
...the image of the Nobel is...

1472
02:02:55,614 --> 02:02:58,450
I see, you came here
to find out if I was crazy?

1473
02:02:59,826 --> 02:03:03,496
Find out if I would screw everything up
if I actually won?

1474
02:03:05,498 --> 02:03:09,669
Dance around the podium,
strip naked and squawk like a chicken?

1475
02:03:10,295 --> 02:03:12,047
Something like that, yes.

1476
02:03:13,673 --> 02:03:15,342
Would I embarrass you?

1477
02:03:19,429 --> 02:03:21,014
Yes, it is possible.

1478
02:03:24,392 --> 02:03:25,602
You see, I...

1479
02:03:27,437 --> 02:03:28,939
I am crazy.

1480
02:03:31,232 --> 02:03:33,360
I take the newer medications...

1481
02:03:37,030 --> 02:03:39,658
...but I still see things that are not here.

1482
02:03:42,243 --> 02:03:44,621
I just choose not to acknowledge them.

1483
02:03:46,581 --> 02:03:50,627
Like a diet of the mind,
I choose not to indulge certain appetites.

1484
02:03:53,463 --> 02:03:55,757
Like my appetite for patterns.

1485
02:03:57,717 --> 02:04:01,012
Perhaps my appetite to imagine
and to dream.

1486
02:04:02,472 --> 02:04:04,015
MAN: Professor Nash.

1487

<i>It's good to have you here, John. </i>

1488
02:04:12,441 --> 02:04:13,526
Thank you.

1489
02:04:18,239 --> 02:04:21,701
- It's an honor, sir.
- Thank you very much.

1490
02:04:22,785 --> 02:04:24,495
A privilege, Professor.

1491
02:04:28,916 --> 02:04:30,167
Professor.

[Poignant instrumental music]

1493
02:04:35,589 --> 02:04:38,342
- Nicely done, John.
- Thank you, Tom.

1494
02:04:40,011 --> 02:04:41,095
Thank you.

1495
02:04:42,596 --> 02:04:43,764
Thank you.

1496
02:04:52,857 --> 02:04:54,191
Thank you, Ed.

1497
02:05:02,575 --> 02:05:04,744
That was certainly most unexpected.

1502
02:05:32,648 --> 02:05:34,733
<i>I've always believed in numbers. </i>

1503
02:05:35,943 --> 02:05:39,112
<i>In the equations and logics</i>
<i>that lead to reason. </i>

1504
02:05:40,280 --> 02:05:42,783
<i>But after a lifetime of such pursuits... </i>

1505
02:05:43,617 --> 02:05:46,995
<i>... I ask, what truly is logic? </i>

1506
02:05:48,747 --> 02:05:50,457
<i>Who decides reason? </i>

1507

I'll call for the car, Dad.

- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

- Are you ready to go now?
- Yes, I am.

02:07:53,998 --> 02:07:56,084
Yes, indeed, and yes, please.

Nothing.

Nothing at all.
