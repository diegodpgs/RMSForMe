1
00:01:20,623 --> 00:01:25,491
<i>No one would have believed
in the early years of the 21st century....</i>

2
00:01:27,503 --> 00:01:32,860
<i>... that our world was being watched
by intelligences greater than our own....</i>

3
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:39,575
<i>... that as men busied themselves
about their various concerns...</i>

4
00:01:40,557 --> 00:01:43,672
<i>... they observed and studied...</i>

5
00:01:45,518 --> 00:01:48,554
<i>... the way a man with a microscope
might scrutinize</i>

6
00:01:48,896 --> 00:01:54,093
<i>the creatures that swarm
and multiply in a drop of water.</i>

7
00:01:55,358 --> 00:02:00,590
<i>With infinite complacency,
men went to and fro about the globe...</i>

8
00:02:01,613 --> 00:02:05,924
<i>... confident of our empire
over this world.</i>

9
00:02:07,786 --> 00:02:10,822
<i>Yet across the gulf of space,</i>

10
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:16,361
<i>intellects vast and cool
and unsympathetic...</i>

11
00:02:16,876 --> 00:02:20,390
<i>... regarded our planet
with envious eyes...</i>

12
00:02:21,422 --> 00:02:24,538
<i>... and slowly and surely...</i>

13
00:02:24,883 --> 00:02:28,270
<i>... drew their plans against us.</i>

14
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:25,069
Tell him to send it over
to the cargo shed.

15
00:03:25,388 --> 00:03:27,298
It's on its way.

16
00:03:40,275 --> 00:03:41,548
Ray.

17
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,987
Ferrier. Whoa.

18
00:03:44,445 --> 00:03:47,641
I need you back in four instead of 12.
I got half of Korea coming in at noon.

19
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,265
No, no, no, I can't.
I'm on a 12-hour blow. Call Tedesco.

20
00:03:51,618 --> 00:03:54,414
Come on. Tedesco can't move
40 containers in an hour.

21
00:03:54,744 --> 00:03:56,814
I gotta have somebody
who can do double picks.

22
00:03:57,121 --> 00:04:00,350
I wish I could help you, Sal.
It's the goddamn union regulations.

23
00:04:00,706 --> 00:04:02,776
Come on.
I'm in a position here, Ray.

24
00:04:03,084 --> 00:04:06,075
You remember
the union regulations, Sal.

25
00:04:06,587 --> 00:04:08,497
You know what your problem is?

26
00:04:08,796 --> 00:04:11,788
I can think of a couple women
who'd be happy to tell you.

27
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,360
8:30? Did we say that?

28
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,449
We said 8:00.

29
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,236
Hey, this is...

30
00:04:43,657 --> 00:04:46,568
This is one safe-looking new vehicle
you got yourself here, Tim.

31
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,139
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

32
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:53,835
Eight o'clock, huh?

33
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,430
We'll be back by 9:30 on Sunday,
depending on the traffic.

34
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:01,899
There he is.

35
00:05:04,506 --> 00:05:05,985
Get a hug?

36
00:05:07,468 --> 00:05:10,857
Confusing handshake?
Kick in the teeth?

37
00:05:11,638 --> 00:05:12,752
The door's locked.

38
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:15,000
Still working on those manners?

39
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,661
Hello, Dad.

40
00:05:19,894 --> 00:05:21,565
Hello, Rachel.

41
00:05:25,023 --> 00:05:28,014
Yo, Stan, hurry up.
We gotta get to work.

42
00:05:33,989 --> 00:05:36,946
Here, honey. Let me
give you a hand getting that inside.

43
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:38,921
- The door's locked.
- Sweetheart, let me get it.

44
00:05:39,202 --> 00:05:42,352
- I don't mind. I don't mind.
- Hey, she said she could get it.

45
00:05:42,704 --> 00:05:44,136
- It's heavy.
- She said she could get it.

46
00:05:44,413 --> 00:05:45,846
It's got rollers. Just roll it, roll it.

47
00:05:46,124 --> 00:05:48,479
Yeah, but we can't roll it
up the stairs, can we?

48
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:51,022
Really, I got it from here, okay?

49
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,301
It's a 302 V8. It's...

50
00:05:59,885 --> 00:06:01,795
It's gonna be out of here next week.

51
00:06:04,387 --> 00:06:07,105
You better get going, you wanna
beat the traffic, don't you think?

52
00:06:08,682 --> 00:06:10,274
You're out of milk.

53
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,537
And everything else.

54
00:06:13,394 --> 00:06:15,430
Yeah.
Could you close the door, please?

55
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,323
Because that's my refrigerator.

56
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:21,499
I'm gonna go wait outside.

57
00:06:23,236 --> 00:06:25,829
Okay, sweetheart.
I'll see you in a few days.

58
00:06:26,572 --> 00:06:28,085
Bye, Tim.

59
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:32,145
- I better get this upstairs.
- Let me... Let me get...

60
00:06:33,328 --> 00:06:34,760
- Mom, Mom, Mom.
- Mary Ann...

61
00:06:35,037 --> 00:06:37,597
- Okay, okay.
- Mom, Mom.

62
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:51,553
A little old to still be sharing,
aren't they?

63
00:06:51,841 --> 00:06:54,912
- I don't hear any complaints.
- No, I do.

64
00:07:00,932 --> 00:07:05,163
Robbie's got a paper on the French
occupation of Algeria due Monday,

65
00:07:05,561 --> 00:07:07,231
which he's yet to begin.

66
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,555
It would be nice if he were done
by the time we got back

67
00:07:09,855 --> 00:07:12,448
so we don't have to keep
him up all night on Sunday.

68
00:07:12,774 --> 00:07:14,412
- I just gotta type it up.
- No.

69
00:07:14,693 --> 00:07:17,570
- You just gotta start writing it first.
- I love you, Mom.

70
00:07:18,362 --> 00:07:19,954
I love you.

71
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,343
Listen to your father.

72
00:07:24,326 --> 00:07:26,919
Oh, no shoes on the bed.

73
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:30,223
We'll be at my parents' house
in Boston,

74
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:32,335
but don't call the house line,
you know, they...

75
00:07:32,623 --> 00:07:35,011
Well, the point is, I've got my cell
phone, so if anything comes up

76
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,846
or you have any questions,
just call me.

77
00:07:37,127 --> 00:07:38,844
Believe it or not, I can handle it.

78
00:07:39,128 --> 00:07:40,800
- I'll leave the phone on.
- Mary Ann.

79
00:07:42,548 --> 00:07:44,697
It's a good look for you.

80
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:48,401
You think?

81
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,775
Yeah.

82
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,668
Take care of our kids.

83
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:58,178
Mary Ann,
you got nothing to worry about.

84
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,709
Listen, you tell your mom that
Ray sends his love and kisses.

85
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,334
Right. She'll love that.

86
00:08:15,656 --> 00:08:18,329
<i>The Ukraine,
a country of some 52 million people,</i>

87
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:20,535
<i>is in almost total blackness tonight,</i>

88
00:08:20,827 --> 00:08:22,943
<i>in the wake of a series
of freakish lightning storms</i>

89
00:08:23,247 --> 00:08:24,838
<i>of catastrophic proportion,</i>

90
00:08:25,123 --> 00:08:27,921
<i>which struck the country at
approximately 4 a. m. Local time.</i>

91
00:08:30,752 --> 00:08:34,426
<i>EMP, or electromagnetic pulse,
which causes a temporary interruption</i>

92
00:08:34,797 --> 00:08:37,311
<i>of all electrical current
within its field.</i>

93
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:40,705
<i>As in the Ukraine, there are
scattered reports that the EMP here</i>

94
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:44,328
<i>was followed by seismic activity
on the scale of an earthquake,</i>

95
00:08:44,681 --> 00:08:48,309
<i>measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale.
This...</i>

96
00:08:51,437 --> 00:08:55,143
- Baseball season's over.
- Five minutes. It's not gonna kill you.

97
00:08:57,481 --> 00:08:58,709
There he is.

98
00:09:03,695 --> 00:09:05,287
Boston.

99
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,168
That's how it is?

100
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:12,251
Is that how it's gonna be?

101
00:09:15,411 --> 00:09:17,686
- Careful with that throw.
- Whatever, Ray.

102
00:09:18,707 --> 00:09:20,059
Mom says you got
a report due on Monday,

103
00:09:20,332 --> 00:09:21,924
so you're gonna work on that
when we're done.

104
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:24,006
Yeah, I'm almost finished.
I just gotta type it up.

105
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:26,436
Yeah, bullshit.

106
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:30,466
Yeah? What do you know, Ray?

107
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,483
Everything. Haven't you heard?
Between me and my brother,

108
00:09:33,802 --> 00:09:35,474
we know everything.

109
00:09:37,013 --> 00:09:38,569
What's the capital of Australia?

110
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,289
That's one my brother knows.

111
00:09:43,893 --> 00:09:47,521
Okay with you if I just laugh the first
500 times you tell that one?

112
00:09:50,398 --> 00:09:53,469
Just do your report. We don't send
you to school so you can flunk out.

113
00:09:54,819 --> 00:09:56,888
You don't pay for it, Tim does.

114
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,622
That's half what I've got.

115
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:07,913
You're an asshole.
I hate coming here.

116
00:10:08,747 --> 00:10:10,225
That why you act like such a dick?

117
00:10:26,385 --> 00:10:27,579
What?

118
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:30,456
That's not how you're gonna
get through to him.

119
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,047
- If you want him to listen to you...
- What are you, your mother or mine?

120
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,123
- Where you going?
- I'm going to sleep, you know?

121
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:40,665
I work for a living.

122
00:10:42,564 --> 00:10:46,239
- What are we supposed to eat?
- You know, order.

123
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,967
<i>Three and two...</i>

124
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,166
<i>- Electromagnetic storm...
- The storms were tracked...</i>

125
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:20,457
<i>Oh, and I'll have my own little secret.
Good idea, eh, Gary?</i>

126
00:11:20,843 --> 00:11:22,913
<i>- No.
- Oh, what do you know?</i>

127
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:24,972
<i>You're a snail.</i>

128
00:11:34,772 --> 00:11:36,046
What's the matter?

129
00:11:36,315 --> 00:11:38,145
- Got a splinter.
- Oh?

130
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:42,365
Where'd you get it? Come here.

131
00:11:43,112 --> 00:11:44,670
On your porch railing.

132
00:11:44,947 --> 00:11:48,255
Do you need me to...? What?
To do what? You want me to...?

133
00:11:50,284 --> 00:11:52,922
- You want me to take that out?
- Absolutely not.

134
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:56,475
Come here.
Let me see it. Let me see.

135
00:11:56,831 --> 00:11:58,150
Dad.

136
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,053
- Just look. Don't touch it. Dad.
- Rach.

137
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:04,087
- I can't. You're moving it around.
- Okay, don't touch it. Just look at it.

138
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:06,570
It's gonna get infected.

139
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:08,477
- No, it won't.
- Yes, it's gonna get infected.

140
00:12:08,758 --> 00:12:10,270
No, it won't.

141
00:12:10,676 --> 00:12:14,463
When it's ready,
my body will just push it out.

142
00:12:15,304 --> 00:12:17,534
- Push it out, huh?
- I read that.

143
00:12:21,018 --> 00:12:22,769
You should get TiVo.

144
00:12:23,685 --> 00:12:25,403
- Tim got it for my room.
- TiVo?

145
00:12:25,687 --> 00:12:26,836
It's awesome.

146
00:12:28,022 --> 00:12:30,582
I can watch all my shows
after homework.

147
00:12:32,191 --> 00:12:34,500
Yeah, I'll just put it
on my platinum card.

148
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:36,172
Robbie?

149
00:12:36,446 --> 00:12:37,878
Robbie.

150
00:12:42,033 --> 00:12:43,671
What is that?

151
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:46,513
Hummus.

152
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:49,798
- Hummus?
- From the health-food place.

153
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,645
Kept one of their menus
last time we were here.

154
00:12:56,211 --> 00:12:58,008
You said order.

155
00:12:58,964 --> 00:13:00,760
I meant order food.

156
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,403
Where is Robbie?

157
00:13:03,677 --> 00:13:05,906
- He went out.
- Out where?

158
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,416
I don't know.
He just took your car and left.

159
00:13:09,764 --> 00:13:11,959
<i>Who said that? Who's there?</i>

160
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:14,257
<i>It's the clam burglar.</i>

161
00:13:41,913 --> 00:13:43,312
Steven, look at this.

162
00:13:43,581 --> 00:13:46,014
- What's up?
- Check it out!

163
00:13:49,545 --> 00:13:52,012
You ever see something like that?

164
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:54,727
Springtime, maybe.
Not this time of year.

165
00:13:55,049 --> 00:13:57,722
Come on, we can see better
from the back yard.

166
00:14:19,861 --> 00:14:21,897
You gotta come see this!

167
00:14:33,162 --> 00:14:35,994
- That is so weird.
- What?

168
00:14:36,623 --> 00:14:38,659
The wind is blowing
toward the storm.

169
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,835
That is weird.

170
00:14:41,293 --> 00:14:43,011
Hey, watch it!

171
00:14:44,922 --> 00:14:47,754
Rachel,
you wanna see something cool?

172
00:15:21,118 --> 00:15:22,550
It's okay.

173
00:15:22,994 --> 00:15:24,983
- I wanna go inside.
- It's okay.

174
00:15:25,286 --> 00:15:27,003
I wanna go inside.

175
00:15:27,788 --> 00:15:29,380
Okay, you go ahead.

176
00:15:31,456 --> 00:15:33,686
That's enough weather for me.

177
00:15:34,418 --> 00:15:36,487
Don't wanna go by myself.

178
00:15:41,215 --> 00:15:42,648
It's kind of fun, isn't it?

179
00:15:42,925 --> 00:15:45,518
- No.
- Come on, like the Fourth of July.

180
00:15:46,219 --> 00:15:49,449
<i>- No, it's not.
- O, say can...</i>

181
00:15:59,688 --> 00:16:01,326
It's okay. You're fine.

182
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:03,915
- It hit right behind our house.
- Yeah, well, it's...

183
00:16:04,234 --> 00:16:05,906
It's not gonna hit there again, okay,

184
00:16:06,194 --> 00:16:09,582
because lightning doesn't strike
twice in the same place. Oh, shit!

185
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,251
Where's Robbie?

186
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,269
I don't know.

187
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,578
Is Robbie okay?

188
00:16:25,877 --> 00:16:27,594
Are you okay?

189
00:16:27,878 --> 00:16:29,709
Where's the thunder?

190
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:32,169
Why won't it stop?

191
00:16:46,225 --> 00:16:47,738
Is it over?

192
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:04,424
Where are you going?

193
00:17:04,698 --> 00:17:08,451
Just... I'm just checking things out.
Just wait... Wait there.

194
00:17:08,826 --> 00:17:11,294
- Are we gonna be okay?
- I don't know.

195
00:17:11,621 --> 00:17:13,576
- You don't know?
- No, I meant, I just... Just...

196
00:17:13,872 --> 00:17:15,430
Rachel, please.

197
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:19,063
Just stop asking so many questions.
Just wait here.

198
00:17:56,947 --> 00:17:59,016
Turn everything off.

199
00:17:59,324 --> 00:18:01,235
Everything is off.

200
00:18:01,534 --> 00:18:04,764
I can't get one freaking thing
to turn on.

201
00:18:06,788 --> 00:18:09,586
You believe this, Ray?
Every single car.

202
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,297
Oh, Jesus. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

203
00:18:13,586 --> 00:18:15,383
- The car just stopped, and...
- You're okay?

204
00:18:15,671 --> 00:18:18,263
- Are you okay? You all right?
- The lightning started to hit.

205
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:20,544
- And me and this other guy...
- Where the hell did you go?

206
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,229
- Over on Lincoln Avenue.
- Lincoln Avenue?

207
00:18:23,552 --> 00:18:24,871
- By the church.
- You saw the lightning?

208
00:18:25,135 --> 00:18:27,205
Yeah, 26 times we counted,
over and over again.

209
00:18:27,513 --> 00:18:30,185
The lightning started to hit.
It opened up this hole or something...

210
00:18:30,515 --> 00:18:32,267
- Twenty-six times?
- Yeah.

211
00:18:33,477 --> 00:18:34,704
- You're okay?
- Yeah.

212
00:18:34,977 --> 00:18:37,013
Good. All right, well,
your sister is in the house,

213
00:18:37,313 --> 00:18:40,383
and I want you to go in that house
and I want you to stay with her, okay?

214
00:18:40,731 --> 00:18:44,359
The next time you take my car with
no driver's license and no permission,

215
00:18:44,734 --> 00:18:46,213
I call the cops.

216
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:50,478
You better be there when I get back.

217
00:18:51,365 --> 00:18:53,275
- Yeah.
- Robbie.

218
00:18:58,329 --> 00:19:01,161
Manny, Manny.
Manny, what is it, dead?

219
00:19:01,665 --> 00:19:04,132
All of them. Everything.
Look at this.

220
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:06,532
- The starter's fried.
- Lightning hit it?

221
00:19:06,835 --> 00:19:08,826
Not even close.
I thought if I changed it...

222
00:19:09,296 --> 00:19:11,525
- Any idea what's going on?
- I'm on my way to find out.

223
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:13,795
Try changing the solenoid.
It's probably fried.

224
00:19:14,092 --> 00:19:16,651
Right, that's what I said.
I told you that. The solenoid.

225
00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:21,734
Hey, they're saying all the
lightning struck down by the church.

226
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:35,022
What the hell is going on
around here?

227
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:37,558
- Let us through.
- Hey.

228
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,013
- Let us through here.
- Hey.

229
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,837
What up, Ray?

230
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:42,706
I should've known
you two were behind this.

231
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,943
Hey, God's pissed off at the
neighborhood, Raymond.

232
00:19:45,239 --> 00:19:46,831
- I'll tell you that much.
- You see it?

233
00:19:47,116 --> 00:19:49,345
- You got power where you are?
- Nope. Nothing.

234
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,013
It's the cars, though.
That's the thing.

235
00:19:51,286 --> 00:19:53,082
Solar flare. That's what
this guy told me he heard.

236
00:19:53,371 --> 00:19:56,124
- A solar flare?
- The sun shoots off big blobs of plasma.

237
00:19:56,457 --> 00:19:59,016
They turn into solar flares.
It's the only thing that can kill

238
00:19:59,334 --> 00:20:01,244
- all the electronic stuff.
- Can I tell you something?

239
00:20:01,544 --> 00:20:02,772
The sun does not cause lightning.

240
00:20:03,046 --> 00:20:04,923
- I'm telling you what that guy said.
- I understand,

241
00:20:05,215 --> 00:20:06,647
but it just sounds dumb
when you say...

242
00:20:13,555 --> 00:20:15,033
I never seen anything like this before.

243
00:20:15,306 --> 00:20:17,058
That many strikes of lightning
in one spot?

244
00:20:17,725 --> 00:20:19,477
- Is this the only place?
- Come on, put that down.

245
00:20:19,768 --> 00:20:21,759
- You wanna step back, please?
- Step back.

246
00:20:22,062 --> 00:20:24,177
- You're gonna fall in.
- Get back.

247
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:28,991
Back up, people.
People, back up back there.

248
00:20:30,818 --> 00:20:33,615
Move back. Everybody back up.

249
00:20:33,945 --> 00:20:35,424
Move back.

250
00:20:35,989 --> 00:20:37,547
Move back.

251
00:20:41,243 --> 00:20:42,471
- Is it hot?
- Back up.

252
00:20:42,744 --> 00:20:44,382
- No.
- Back up.

253
00:20:44,663 --> 00:20:46,301
- It's freezing.
- What is that?

254
00:20:46,998 --> 00:20:48,476
Oh, wait. Move. You feel that?

255
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,705
- I feel that.
- Hey, Bobby, come check this out.

256
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,654
- You feel that?
- Feel that?

257
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,511
- Yeah, I feel that.
- What is it, the subway?

258
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,626
- There's no subway here.
- F train, maybe?

259
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,318
That can't be the water main.

260
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,819
There's nothing else down there.

261
00:21:01,092 --> 00:21:02,650
- Water main doesn't run through here.
- Feel that?

262
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:04,599
There's something down there
and it's moving.

263
00:21:09,808 --> 00:21:12,001
Everybody move back.

264
00:21:12,476 --> 00:21:14,307
Whoa. Back it up. Come on.

265
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:16,668
Let's go.

266
00:21:17,438 --> 00:21:19,905
Come on, folks. Back up.
Get back.

267
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,737
Help me out here. Get back.

268
00:21:35,537 --> 00:21:37,175
- Go! Move!
- Everybody get out of the way!

269
00:21:37,455 --> 00:21:40,127
Everyone back up!
Everyone clear the intersection!

270
00:21:40,457 --> 00:21:44,335
Get out of the way! Back up!
Back up! Get out of the way!

271
00:22:01,471 --> 00:22:05,622
- Forget it! Get back!
- Get the hell out of the street!

272
00:22:16,943 --> 00:22:18,501
Move away!

273
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,653
Come on, we gotta
clear this area now!

274
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,667
That's my car!

275
00:23:17,033 --> 00:23:18,352
Go, go.

276
00:23:18,617 --> 00:23:20,686
Get the hell out of here!

277
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,726
Oh, my God!

278
00:23:47,765 --> 00:23:48,880
Come on, people! Let's go!

279
00:23:49,142 --> 00:23:50,779
Come on, back up!

280
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,494
Please! Move back!

281
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:17,358
Watch it!

282
00:25:19,962 --> 00:25:21,680
Oh, my God.

283
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,490
Ray, no. Stay, man.

284
00:25:34,515 --> 00:25:36,345
Just stay.

285
00:25:36,641 --> 00:25:40,428
- Just stay back here. Stay back!
- Wow.

286
00:25:56,158 --> 00:25:57,386
Come on.

287
00:28:11,805 --> 00:28:13,636
What happened?

288
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:17,442
What's going on?

289
00:28:18,561 --> 00:28:20,313
Dad, what's the matter?

290
00:28:21,605 --> 00:28:23,639
What's all that stuff all over you?

291
00:28:27,483 --> 00:28:28,996
- Ray.
- What's all this stuff?

292
00:28:29,277 --> 00:28:30,550
Hello?

293
00:28:31,403 --> 00:28:32,756
Ray?

294
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:09,006
We're leaving this house
in 60 seconds.

295
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:11,298
What? Why?
I have no idea what's going on.

296
00:29:11,601 --> 00:29:13,990
All the food from the refrigerator
and the cupboard, put it in here.

297
00:29:14,312 --> 00:29:16,347
- What's going on? Just tell me.
- Just do it.

298
00:29:17,106 --> 00:29:19,415
- Rachel, sweetheart...
- Dad, you're really scaring me.

299
00:29:19,733 --> 00:29:21,848
- I need you to get your suitcase,
- Dad.

300
00:29:22,152 --> 00:29:24,507
The one that you brought,
and bring it to me, okay?

301
00:29:24,821 --> 00:29:28,096
Can you just do that for me, darling?
Okay?

302
00:29:42,836 --> 00:29:44,348
I don't think it's a fire.

303
00:29:45,421 --> 00:29:48,253
- See? That looks like smoke to me.
- What's happening?

304
00:29:48,715 --> 00:29:53,150
I can't tell you now.
We've only got about another minute.

305
00:29:59,098 --> 00:30:00,656
Please.

306
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:02,411
Please.

307
00:30:08,648 --> 00:30:10,718
- Just keep it down.
- Ray, I'm standing right beside you.

308
00:30:11,024 --> 00:30:13,094
Can you please answer me?

309
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:16,809
Just get in the front seat, Robbie.

310
00:30:22,116 --> 00:30:23,435
- Whose car is this?
- Just get in.

311
00:30:23,701 --> 00:30:25,418
Whose car is this?

312
00:30:28,205 --> 00:30:30,559
Hey. Hey, Ray.
You were absolutely right.

313
00:30:30,874 --> 00:30:33,261
That is exact...
I had to change the solen...

314
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,338
Ray? Hey.

315
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:38,856
Hey, Ray? Ray.

316
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,604
Ray.

317
00:30:42,548 --> 00:30:44,026
What...? Come on, open up.

318
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:45,812
Open the door, come on.

319
00:30:46,093 --> 00:30:48,287
Open the door, Ray.
What are you...?

320
00:30:48,594 --> 00:30:50,266
- Get in, Manny.
- You gotta get out of the car.

321
00:30:50,555 --> 00:30:52,431
- Get in the car.
- It's not my car. It's not your car.

322
00:30:52,723 --> 00:30:54,918
- Manny, Manny, shut up.
- Daddy's acting crazy.

323
00:30:55,225 --> 00:30:56,942
You can't do this.
Guy's gonna come back and...

324
00:30:57,227 --> 00:30:58,785
Manny, Manny,
I don't have time to...

325
00:30:59,062 --> 00:31:00,495
You're busting my chops.
I got a shop to run.

326
00:31:00,772 --> 00:31:01,840
- Manny, listen to me.
- No, Ray.

327
00:31:02,106 --> 00:31:03,698
Get in, Manny, or you're gonna die.

328
00:31:04,692 --> 00:31:05,965
- What do you mean?
- Okay.

329
00:31:08,069 --> 00:31:11,140
All right, get out of the truck. I'm not
kidding now. Get out of the car, Ray.

330
00:31:11,489 --> 00:31:13,207
I'm not gonna get in.
I'm not getting in.

331
00:31:13,491 --> 00:31:15,924
- Manny, get in with us.
- I'm not gonna get in trouble.

332
00:31:16,243 --> 00:31:19,392
- Look, I'm not fooling around...
- Close the door, Robbie. Close it.

333
00:31:20,369 --> 00:31:23,805
Ray, bring the car back, Ray.
It's not my car.

334
00:31:28,835 --> 00:31:31,109
Get down!
Get down, get down! Get down!

335
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,614
Is it the terrorists?

336
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,268
- Just get down. Get down! Get down!
- Holy shit!

337
00:32:07,866 --> 00:32:09,822
- Where are we going?
- We gotta go.

338
00:32:10,118 --> 00:32:12,028
We got, maybe, like,
the only working car around here.

339
00:32:12,328 --> 00:32:14,966
- I'm not stopping until we're clear of it.
- Clear of what?

340
00:32:15,289 --> 00:32:16,608
- We gotta go.
- What's going on?

341
00:32:16,874 --> 00:32:19,024
- Look, you saw, we're under attack!
- By who?!

342
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:20,526
Who is attacking us?!

343
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:23,352
Rachel? Rachel,
you've gotta keep it down.

344
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,819
Rachel. Rachel. Shut up, Rachel.

345
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:29,599
- You're freaking her out!
- Look, I'm driving! Do something!

346
00:32:29,967 --> 00:32:32,162
Okay, put them up, Rach.
Make the arms.

347
00:32:32,469 --> 00:32:35,062
This space right here, this is yours.
This belongs to you, right?

348
00:32:35,388 --> 00:32:36,616
- Yes.
- You're safe in your space.

349
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,242
- I'm safe.
- You're safe in your space.

350
00:32:38,515 --> 00:32:39,868
Nothing can happen to you
in your space.

351
00:32:40,142 --> 00:32:42,530
Okay. I'm gonna go to the front seat,
I'm gonna talk to Dad.

352
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:43,965
- No.
- I'll be 2 feet away.

353
00:32:44,227 --> 00:32:45,546
- Okay.
- Will you hold my hand?

354
00:32:45,812 --> 00:32:46,960
- Will you hold my hand?
- Yes.

355
00:32:47,229 --> 00:32:48,947
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yes.

356
00:32:50,858 --> 00:32:52,893
I wanna know everything you know.

357
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,054
This...

358
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,991
This machine,
it crawled out of the ground,

359
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,475
started torching everything.
It was killing everybody.

360
00:33:00,823 --> 00:33:03,383
What is it? Is it terrorists?

361
00:33:03,701 --> 00:33:06,168
No, this came
from someplace else.

362
00:33:06,495 --> 00:33:10,089
- What do you mean, like, Europe?
- No, Robbie, not like Europe!

363
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,069
That machine,

364
00:33:22,342 --> 00:33:25,412
it was already buried.

365
00:33:26,176 --> 00:33:27,894
Maybe it...

366
00:33:28,386 --> 00:33:31,344
...it came down in the lightning storm.

367
00:33:32,348 --> 00:33:36,056
- They came down in a lightning storm.
- What do you mean, came down?

368
00:33:36,435 --> 00:33:38,789
- You said it was buried.
- No, the machine I'm talking about

369
00:33:39,104 --> 00:33:42,175
was buried, but what
came down in the lightning storm,

370
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,532
what operates it,

371
00:33:44,817 --> 00:33:47,284
that's the... You know.

372
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:48,721
- The what?
- That's...

373
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:51,375
Why aren't there any helicopters
or airplanes?

374
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:54,006
- It's the what?
- Hey, Rach. How you doing?

375
00:33:54,325 --> 00:33:55,552
- How is she doing?
- How you doing?

376
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:56,780
- Fine.
- She's good.

377
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,947
- Good. What was that thing you did?
- Works sometimes.

378
00:34:00,287 --> 00:34:01,959
- She gets claustrophobic.
- Yeah? Hey, Rachel?

379
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,920
- I want Mom.
- Yeah, I know. You feel better?

380
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:07,165
- I want Mom.
- Yeah? Tell me about it, you know?

381
00:34:07,502 --> 00:34:08,821
- Take me to Mom's.
- What I need is,

382
00:34:09,087 --> 00:34:11,235
I just need you to hold it together
for me, okay?

383
00:34:11,546 --> 00:34:12,581
I want Mom!

384
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:14,669
When you start screaming,
I can't really drive...

385
00:34:14,966 --> 00:34:16,365
- Take me to Mom's!
- I know that.

386
00:34:16,634 --> 00:34:19,306
- That's where we're going, Rachel.
- Take me to Mom's!

387
00:34:19,636 --> 00:34:21,467
I know!

388
00:34:37,024 --> 00:34:38,935
Hurry up, Dad. Come on.

389
00:34:46,074 --> 00:34:47,871
Robbie, get the door.

390
00:34:49,911 --> 00:34:51,468
Mom!

391
00:34:51,745 --> 00:34:53,142
- Mom!
- Mom!

392
00:34:53,412 --> 00:34:55,129
Mom!

393
00:34:55,913 --> 00:34:58,791
Mom? Tim?

394
00:35:01,084 --> 00:35:03,837
Mom? Tim?

395
00:35:06,881 --> 00:35:08,394
- Mom?
- Mom?

396
00:35:08,675 --> 00:35:11,711
- Tim?!
- Tim?

397
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,800
Tim?

398
00:35:15,597 --> 00:35:17,269
Mom?

399
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:20,165
They're gone.

400
00:35:20,434 --> 00:35:22,231
Is she dead?

401
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,316
She's not dead. All right?

402
00:35:24,604 --> 00:35:25,832
She's just not here, okay?

403
00:35:26,106 --> 00:35:28,538
- They were never here.
- How do you know?

404
00:35:28,856 --> 00:35:30,892
Because they're
on their way to Boston.

405
00:35:31,192 --> 00:35:32,988
And so they just...

406
00:35:33,277 --> 00:35:35,791
...kept on going up to Boston.
Probably at your grandma's house.

407
00:35:36,112 --> 00:35:37,180
I'm gonna call her.

408
00:35:37,446 --> 00:35:40,085
How come the lights are on here
and not at your place?

409
00:35:40,407 --> 00:35:41,680
Because...

410
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:45,498
...nothing bad happened here. Okay?
So we're safe here. All right?

411
00:35:45,869 --> 00:35:47,860
Okay, Rachel? This is your area.

412
00:35:48,163 --> 00:35:51,234
- Okay, you are safe...
- Dad, that's not how it goes.

413
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:54,143
Okay. Well, are you hungry?
I'll get you some food.

414
00:35:54,461 --> 00:35:57,372
I'm gonna feed you.
Get something to eat.

415
00:35:57,713 --> 00:35:58,862
- What do we have?
- Busy signal.

416
00:35:59,131 --> 00:36:01,485
- Ketchup? Mustard.
- You think all the circuits are down?

417
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,869
Tabasco, barbecue sauce.

418
00:36:04,176 --> 00:36:06,736
This is really good, Robbie.
Vinaigrette. I said pack food.

419
00:36:07,054 --> 00:36:09,806
- What the hell is this?
- That's all that was in your kitchen.

420
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,574
Okay. No, it's all right.

421
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:15,759
All right. Okay.

422
00:36:19,313 --> 00:36:20,348
Food.

423
00:36:20,606 --> 00:36:22,039
Bread.

424
00:36:22,482 --> 00:36:24,996
Okay. We're gonna have...

425
00:36:26,194 --> 00:36:27,865
Let's get some sandwiches.

426
00:36:30,698 --> 00:36:32,175
Wanna see me deal?

427
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,628
Wanna see me deal? Here we go.

428
00:36:34,909 --> 00:36:37,342
There's two for you.
There's two for Robbie.

429
00:36:37,661 --> 00:36:39,652
There's two for me,
one for the house.

430
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:44,227
Okay.

431
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,172
Maybe after we eat something,
I'll go down and show you guys...

432
00:36:47,502 --> 00:36:49,856
Teach you how to play some poker?
A little five-card stud?

433
00:36:50,171 --> 00:36:52,605
- Maybe a little blackjack.
- I'm allergic to peanut butter.

434
00:36:54,217 --> 00:36:55,251
Since when?

435
00:36:56,051 --> 00:36:57,723
Birth.

436
00:37:01,055 --> 00:37:02,452
Okay, well, here.

437
00:37:02,722 --> 00:37:04,712
You can eat the bread. Okay?

438
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:06,368
I'm not hungry.

439
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:09,575
Okay, well,

440
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,968
Robbie and I are gonna be
eating peanut-butter sandwiches.

441
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:14,704
- Want jelly on this sandwich?
- I'm not hungry either.

442
00:37:15,023 --> 00:37:16,979
You're not hungry either?

443
00:37:17,275 --> 00:37:18,310
Okay.

444
00:37:18,568 --> 00:37:21,207
Okay, that's fine.

445
00:37:21,529 --> 00:37:22,847
Fine.

446
00:37:29,994 --> 00:37:31,984
Everybody just relax, okay?

447
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:35,517
Because we're here now.
We're safe, and we're gonna stay.

448
00:37:35,873 --> 00:37:37,864
In the morning, your mom and Tim
are gonna be here.

449
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:39,600
And everything's gonna be fine.

450
00:37:39,877 --> 00:37:41,389
Okay?

451
00:37:42,796 --> 00:37:44,548
Okay.

452
00:37:48,216 --> 00:37:50,570
If everything's fine, why do we
have to sleep in the basement?

453
00:37:50,884 --> 00:37:53,875
- We've got perfectly good beds.
- Hey, it's like a slumber party.

454
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,619
What are you afraid
is gonna happen?

455
00:37:55,889 --> 00:37:57,208
Nice basement.

456
00:37:57,474 --> 00:38:01,148
I wanna sleep in my bed.
Got back problems.

457
00:38:02,478 --> 00:38:03,910
Okay. Well...

458
00:38:04,187 --> 00:38:06,747
You know on the Weather Channel
when there's a tornado,

459
00:38:07,065 --> 00:38:09,294
they tell you to go to the basement
for safety? It's like that.

460
00:38:09,608 --> 00:38:11,439
- There's gonna be tornadoes?
- Okay, Rachel?

461
00:38:11,736 --> 00:38:16,092
- Hey, no more talking, okay?
- Could you be a little nicer to me?

462
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,842
God.

463
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:23,574
- Wanna stay here?
- Yeah.

464
00:38:23,829 --> 00:38:25,182
- Good.
- Good night. Love you.

465
00:38:25,455 --> 00:38:27,092
Love you, Rach.

466
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,511
Is the lightning back?

467
00:39:44,974 --> 00:39:47,010
No, this is something else.

468
00:40:06,824 --> 00:40:09,258
- What's that sound?
- I've never heard that before!

469
00:40:09,577 --> 00:40:10,896
Is it them? Is it them?

470
00:40:12,955 --> 00:40:13,990
We gotta go.

471
00:40:14,248 --> 00:40:15,919
Where do we go?!
Robbie, this is your house.

472
00:40:16,207 --> 00:40:17,242
Where do we go?!

473
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:30,234
No, no, no, wait!

474
00:40:49,442 --> 00:40:51,751
Are we still alive?

475
00:42:44,575 --> 00:42:46,213
Down here.

476
00:42:50,578 --> 00:42:52,408
Were you on this plane?

477
00:42:53,747 --> 00:42:55,863
Are you...?
Are you a passenger?

478
00:43:02,922 --> 00:43:05,674
How you doing?
Wanna help me open this?

479
00:43:08,343 --> 00:43:10,015
Are you a passenger?

480
00:43:10,303 --> 00:43:11,861
He's deaf.

481
00:43:12,138 --> 00:43:15,607
The shell went off right beside him.
Camera on his shoulder saved his life.

482
00:43:15,974 --> 00:43:17,248
You hear that, Max?

483
00:43:17,517 --> 00:43:19,984
Your stupid camera
saved your stupid life.

484
00:43:20,978 --> 00:43:22,696
Where were you?

485
00:43:23,314 --> 00:43:25,144
Out there in the Pine Barrens.

486
00:43:26,066 --> 00:43:27,863
We were attached to
a National Guard unit.

487
00:43:28,152 --> 00:43:29,470
The 83rd Mechanized.

488
00:43:29,736 --> 00:43:31,613
They moved on one of those things
around midnight.

489
00:43:32,153 --> 00:43:33,631
They got some kind of shield
around them.

490
00:43:33,904 --> 00:43:36,498
You can't see it, but everything we fire
at them detonates too early,

491
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:39,495
before we can get close enough
to cause any damage.

492
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,753
When they flash that thing,
everything lights up like Hiroshima.

493
00:43:44,621 --> 00:43:46,691
There's more than one?

494
00:43:47,915 --> 00:43:49,746
You gotta be kidding me, right?

495
00:43:51,044 --> 00:43:53,033
We were feeding New York,
but New York went dark.

496
00:43:53,336 --> 00:43:55,566
So we patched over to D.C.,
they went down.

497
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,473
L.A., Chicago, uplinked to London.

498
00:43:58,799 --> 00:44:01,790
Even called the affiliates to try
to get them to catch the feed,

499
00:44:02,135 --> 00:44:04,649
but nobody answers.
It's the same everywhere.

500
00:44:04,971 --> 00:44:09,202
Once the Tripods start to move,
no more news comes out of that area.

501
00:44:20,023 --> 00:44:21,661
My God.

502
00:44:22,776 --> 00:44:24,606
You ain't seen nothing yet.

503
00:44:27,655 --> 00:44:30,771
I saw that storm. I was right
in the middle of one of those.

504
00:44:31,116 --> 00:44:32,515
Well, you didn't see it like this.

505
00:44:32,784 --> 00:44:35,059
Those machines come up
from under the ground, right?

506
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:38,122
So that means they must've been
buried here a long time ago.

507
00:44:38,455 --> 00:44:42,367
So who's driving the goddamn things?
Watch the lightning.

508
00:44:42,751 --> 00:44:44,343
Watch it.

509
00:44:45,837 --> 00:44:46,951
Watch the lightning.

510
00:44:47,213 --> 00:44:49,283
Keep watching the lightning.

511
00:44:53,385 --> 00:44:55,262
What is that?

512
00:44:55,554 --> 00:44:59,510
That is them.
They come down in capsules,

513
00:44:59,889 --> 00:45:02,686
riding the lightning into the ground,
into the machines, right?

514
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:07,607
You hear that?

515
00:45:07,895 --> 00:45:10,169
We're getting the hell out of here.

516
00:45:13,734 --> 00:45:15,371
Get in, get in, get in, get in.

517
00:45:17,069 --> 00:45:19,980
Hey, were you on that plane?

518
00:45:21,907 --> 00:45:25,057
That's too bad.
It would've been a really great story.

519
00:45:27,245 --> 00:45:29,280
Look at me. Look at me.

520
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,616
You keep your eyes only on me,
understand?

521
00:45:31,915 --> 00:45:33,745
- Okay.
- Don't look down. Don't look around.

522
00:45:34,584 --> 00:45:37,416
I'm taking you to the car.
You're gonna wanna look around.

523
00:45:37,753 --> 00:45:38,742
But you're not going to.

524
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:41,132
- Are you?
- No.

525
00:45:41,423 --> 00:45:44,651
You're doing good. You're doing good.
Keep your eyes on me.

526
00:45:45,007 --> 00:45:46,121
I'm going right to Boston.

527
00:45:46,383 --> 00:45:48,453
- We're gonna see your mom.
- I'm not gonna look, Dad.

528
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,670
That's a girl. That's my girl.
Now listen.

529
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:52,608
- I want you to close your eyes, okay?
- Okay.

530
00:45:52,889 --> 00:45:55,118
Got them closed? There you go.

531
00:45:55,432 --> 00:45:57,627
- Keep them closed for me.
- Okay.

532
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,095
Robbie, get in.

533
00:46:06,315 --> 00:46:07,953
- Robbie, get in!
- Why are you yelling?

534
00:46:08,234 --> 00:46:09,746
It's okay.

535
00:46:12,237 --> 00:46:13,589
Get in.

536
00:46:34,463 --> 00:46:36,498
- Why aren't we on the turnpike?
- I don't want everybody

537
00:46:36,798 --> 00:46:39,153
to see that we've got a working car.
We'll stay along the Hudson

538
00:46:39,467 --> 00:46:42,617
till we find an open bridge or ferry,
then we're gonna cross the Hudson.

539
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:46,757
We'll take the back roads across
Connecticut, all the way to Boston.

540
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:50,018
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know, running, hiding.

541
00:46:50,351 --> 00:46:52,307
- In their basements.
- If we had balls, we'd go back

542
00:46:52,603 --> 00:46:55,912
- and find one of those things and kill it.
- Right. Yeah, good.

543
00:46:56,273 --> 00:46:58,150
Why don't you just let me
make the big decisions.

544
00:46:58,442 --> 00:46:59,840
Which would be when? Never, Ray?

545
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:01,383
- Never's about your speed.
- Stop it.

546
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,482
Enough of the "Ray" shit. All right?

547
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,006
- It's "Dad," "sir,"
- Don't fight.

548
00:47:05,279 --> 00:47:07,190
Or if you want, "Mr. Ferrier. "

549
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:10,605
That sounds a little weird to me,
but you decide.

550
00:47:11,325 --> 00:47:14,122
- Dad?
- Yes, Rachel.

551
00:47:16,454 --> 00:47:18,603
I've gotta go to the bathroom.

552
00:47:19,582 --> 00:47:21,220
Really?

553
00:47:27,338 --> 00:47:29,772
- I gotta go.
- Not so fast, not so fast, all right?

554
00:47:30,091 --> 00:47:31,842
There's two things
we gotta watch out for.

555
00:47:32,134 --> 00:47:34,443
And the second is people
who might want our car.

556
00:47:34,761 --> 00:47:37,354
- There's nobody around.
- Yeah. I gotta go.

557
00:47:45,186 --> 00:47:46,175
All right, Rachel?

558
00:47:46,437 --> 00:47:47,836
Rachel, it's good right there.

559
00:47:48,106 --> 00:47:50,175
I'm not going in front of you guys.

560
00:47:50,482 --> 00:47:54,233
- Just go where I can see you.
- Are you crazy?

561
00:47:54,608 --> 00:47:56,360
- Don't look!
- I'm not gonna look.

562
00:47:56,652 --> 00:47:59,370
- Just stay in sight!
- That's looking!

563
00:48:00,906 --> 00:48:03,578
Okay, well, listen, every time
you guys don't listen to me,

564
00:48:03,908 --> 00:48:07,422
I'm telling your mother, okay?
I'm making a list.

565
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:10,421
Making a list.

566
00:48:52,697 --> 00:48:55,256
- I told you to stay where I could see you.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

567
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,148
Stop! Stop!

568
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,138
Wait! Stop! Let me on!

569
00:49:14,923 --> 00:49:16,958
Let me on! Give me a hand!

570
00:49:17,258 --> 00:49:18,770
Wait! Stop!

571
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:21,722
- Stop! Give me a hand!
- Kid, you're gonna get run over!

572
00:49:22,052 --> 00:49:24,771
- Give me a hand! You have room!
- Robbie!

573
00:49:25,097 --> 00:49:27,849
- You wanna go in that direction?
- Stop! Stop!

574
00:49:28,183 --> 00:49:31,094
There's nothing living
in that direction, Robbie.

575
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:33,232
What do you care?
You never gave a shit before.

576
00:49:33,521 --> 00:49:35,476
- You never gave a shit!
- Okay, hard-ass,

577
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:37,922
what's your plan, huh?
You're in charge now!

578
00:49:38,233 --> 00:49:40,348
- Tell me what we're doing.
- Catch up with these soldiers!

579
00:49:40,651 --> 00:49:43,484
Hook up with whoever else isn't dead,
and we get back at them.

580
00:49:43,821 --> 00:49:47,017
We get back at them.
That's what we do.

581
00:49:47,366 --> 00:49:51,358
Let's try one that doesn't involve your
10-year-old sister joining the Army.

582
00:49:51,744 --> 00:49:54,132
- You have anything like that?
- Just tell us the truth.

583
00:49:54,454 --> 00:49:56,490
- Wanna try that?
- You have no idea which way to go.

584
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:58,700
You wanna come off all wise and shit!

585
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,466
You only chose Boston
because you hope Mom is there.

586
00:50:01,792 --> 00:50:03,941
And if she's there,
you can dump us on her.

587
00:50:04,252 --> 00:50:07,561
You can dump us on her, then you'll
only have to care about yourself,

588
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:11,436
which is exactly the way you like it.

589
00:50:12,591 --> 00:50:13,865
Robbie!

590
00:50:14,135 --> 00:50:16,171
Where are you trying to go?

591
00:50:16,469 --> 00:50:18,983
What are you trying to do?

592
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:22,767
Who's gonna take care of me
if you go?

593
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:43,458
<i>This is a test of
the Emergency Alert System.</i>

594
00:50:44,326 --> 00:50:46,839
<i>If this had been an actual emergency,
official messages</i>

595
00:50:47,161 --> 00:50:50,835
<i>from federal, state or local authorities
would've followed the alert tone.</i>

596
00:50:51,206 --> 00:50:53,799
<i>This concludes the test
of the Emergency Alert...</i>

597
00:50:55,794 --> 00:50:58,387
I'll close my eyes.
Why don't you drive for a bit.

598
00:50:59,588 --> 00:51:01,544
I don't have a license.

599
00:51:02,757 --> 00:51:04,987
Since when has that stopped you?

600
00:51:35,741 --> 00:51:37,379
Ray.

601
00:51:39,452 --> 00:51:40,710
Ray! Dad!

602
00:51:40,801 --> 00:51:42,025
Ray! Dad!

603
00:51:45,458 --> 00:51:46,732
You think you could...?

604
00:51:47,001 --> 00:51:49,560
You think you could...?
Do you think you could...?

605
00:51:50,545 --> 00:51:51,864
Don't stop.

606
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:54,085
Don't take your foot off. Okay?

607
00:51:54,382 --> 00:51:56,816
I got it, but keep your foot on.
Okay, I got it. I got it.

608
00:51:57,135 --> 00:52:00,171
- Where is everybody going?
- I don't know, Rach.

609
00:52:00,512 --> 00:52:02,388
But we do, right?

610
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,477
Yeah, we do.

611
00:52:16,398 --> 00:52:17,955
Why did he do that?

612
00:52:20,233 --> 00:52:22,110
- Why is he doing that?
- He wants a ride, Rach.

613
00:52:22,402 --> 00:52:25,313
- Everybody just wants a ride.
- Can we give him one?

614
00:52:25,655 --> 00:52:29,091
Sit back and put on your seat belt.
Robbie, put on your seat belt.

615
00:52:29,449 --> 00:52:31,280
Put on your seat belt, Rachel.

616
00:52:34,579 --> 00:52:36,376
- Be careful.
- How'd you fix this?

617
00:52:36,664 --> 00:52:40,019
- How'd you fix the car?
- Please! Why won't you help us?

618
00:52:42,086 --> 00:52:43,803
I'm sorry, I can't. I can't.

619
00:52:44,087 --> 00:52:45,486
Please, get away from the car.

620
00:52:45,755 --> 00:52:47,710
Hey! Stop the car.

621
00:52:48,006 --> 00:52:50,600
- Stop the car!
- Get off the car!

622
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:53,625
You could carry 20 people in there!

623
00:52:53,928 --> 00:52:55,883
- Stop the car!
- Get off the car!

624
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,737
Stop the car!

625
00:53:02,059 --> 00:53:03,777
Hold on.

626
00:53:04,061 --> 00:53:05,016
Look out!

627
00:53:05,271 --> 00:53:06,749
Watch out! Hold on!

628
00:53:15,904 --> 00:53:16,939
Are you okay?

629
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,300
No, wait! Wait!

630
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,972
No! Just wait! Okay! Wait! Stop!

631
00:53:35,294 --> 00:53:37,091
- Just stop!
- Daddy!

632
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,811
Rachel!

633
00:53:39,547 --> 00:53:41,185
Get out of there!

634
00:53:42,633 --> 00:53:44,350
Robbie!

635
00:53:51,807 --> 00:53:53,558
Robbie!

636
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:56,159
- Ray!
- Get in the car!

637
00:54:01,314 --> 00:54:03,874
- Help!
- Rachel! Get out of the car!

638
00:54:04,192 --> 00:54:06,102
Rachel, get...
Get out of the car.

639
00:54:06,402 --> 00:54:08,677
- Get out!
- Daddy!

640
00:54:16,202 --> 00:54:18,193
- Take it easy!
- Get off the car!

641
00:54:18,496 --> 00:54:19,814
Get off!

642
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,477
Get off the car! Move!

643
00:54:21,747 --> 00:54:23,384
Move!

644
00:54:23,664 --> 00:54:25,381
- Where's my son?
- You don't need that, man.

645
00:54:25,665 --> 00:54:28,054
- Where's my son? Robbie!
- Cool down, man.

646
00:54:28,376 --> 00:54:30,172
- Put the gun down, man.
- Robbie!

647
00:54:36,383 --> 00:54:37,895
Dad!

648
00:54:39,802 --> 00:54:41,394
Okay, now, listen.

649
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:44,511
- Put down the gun. I'm taking the car.
- My daughter's in the car.

650
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:46,725
- I'm taking the car, man.
- Please. All I want...

651
00:54:47,016 --> 00:54:49,530
- Put down the goddamn gun!
- All I want is my daughter.

652
00:54:49,852 --> 00:54:52,081
- I'm taking the car, man.
- Please, I just want my daughter.

653
00:54:52,396 --> 00:54:54,273
Let me just take my daughter.
Can I...?

654
00:54:54,565 --> 00:54:57,522
- All I want is my daughter.
- Yeah. Okay, go ahead, man.

655
00:54:58,318 --> 00:54:59,797
Robbie.

656
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:12,139
Take me with you!

657
00:56:13,635 --> 00:56:15,466
Have you seen this girl?
This is my daughter.

658
00:56:15,762 --> 00:56:17,514
He needs his medicine.

659
00:56:29,397 --> 00:56:31,226
We've got it the worst,
that's what I heard.

660
00:56:31,523 --> 00:56:34,320
The U.S., mostly.
South America and Asia, some.

661
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:36,207
There's nothing going on in Europe.

662
00:56:36,484 --> 00:56:38,998
Europe got the worst of it,
that's what everybody's saying.

663
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,514
- Completely wiped out some of it.
- I don't give a shit who it is.

664
00:56:41,822 --> 00:56:44,097
I got up close to one of those things
in Stanfordville.

665
00:56:44,408 --> 00:56:45,965
If they're all over the place,
we're dead.

666
00:56:46,242 --> 00:56:48,881
- Looks like the power's still on here.
- Yeah.

667
00:56:49,204 --> 00:56:51,159
Yeah, power's still on.

668
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:54,446
Because nothing bad's come up
from the ground.

669
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:57,942
- Hold on. Hold on, move back!
- Watch out there, lady!

670
00:56:58,295 --> 00:57:00,171
I said, move back!

671
00:57:36,699 --> 00:57:39,736
Unless you are O-positive
and RH-negative,

672
00:57:40,078 --> 00:57:44,036
thank you very much, but we already
have more blood than we can use.

673
00:57:44,414 --> 00:57:50,851
Again, if you are O-positive,
RH-negative, identify yourselves.

674
00:57:51,336 --> 00:57:53,292
If you are not, thank you very much.

675
00:57:53,589 --> 00:57:56,545
We already have more blood
than we can use for the transfusions.

676
00:57:56,882 --> 00:57:58,600
Let's go, folks.

677
00:57:58,883 --> 00:58:01,681
This way. This way.
Keep it moving.

678
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:05,844
Keep it moving. This way.
Let's go, folks. Keep it moving.

679
00:58:06,223 --> 00:58:10,010
Please move forward calmly.
The boat can make more than one trip.

680
00:58:10,393 --> 00:58:14,510
Please move forward calmly.
Take your time. Don't rush.

681
00:58:14,897 --> 00:58:17,046
Ray! Ray! Ray!

682
00:58:17,357 --> 00:58:19,587
- Sheryl?
- Yeah. Hey.

683
00:58:19,901 --> 00:58:21,572
Oh, my gosh, is this your...?

684
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:22,975
- Are these your kids?
- Rachel.

685
00:58:23,237 --> 00:58:25,626
Hi, I'm Sheryl.
This is my daughter, Nora.

686
00:58:25,948 --> 00:58:28,063
- Nora. I've heard about you, Nora.
- Hi.

687
00:58:28,366 --> 00:58:31,084
- This is my son, Robbie.
- Just like Dad.

688
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:49,377
- It's good to see you as well.
- Trees are funny.

689
00:58:49,714 --> 00:58:53,672
We're gonna move a few cars out
of the way to make some more space.

690
00:58:54,927 --> 00:58:56,918
You're gonna have to give us
a few minutes.

691
00:58:57,221 --> 00:59:00,098
But don't worry,
there'll be plenty of room for everybody.

692
00:59:00,557 --> 00:59:02,752
We got sick people here.
Let us on.

693
00:59:38,795 --> 00:59:41,149
Cast off. Get that ramp up.

694
00:59:41,464 --> 00:59:44,296
Cast off now. Get that ramp up.

695
00:59:44,633 --> 00:59:45,748
Cast off.

696
00:59:46,009 --> 00:59:48,806
No more people. No more people.
We're taking the ramp up.

697
01:00:14,574 --> 01:00:17,645
Stay close. Stay close.

698
01:00:18,118 --> 01:00:20,632
Everybody stop. Everybody stop.

699
01:00:20,954 --> 01:00:23,343
- Wait, wait, wait. Just...
- Back up. Back up.

700
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:25,734
- There's room.
- Just stay back.

701
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,399
No more room.
There's no more room.

702
01:00:27,668 --> 01:00:29,067
Just listen to me.
There's three of us.

703
01:00:29,336 --> 01:00:31,485
- Five. There's only five of us.
- There's no room.

704
01:00:31,796 --> 01:00:32,990
Okay, man, just don't push me.

705
01:00:33,256 --> 01:00:35,405
- Sir, there's no more room.
- There's plenty of room.

706
01:00:35,716 --> 01:00:37,866
- There's room for hundreds more.
- Sir...

707
01:00:38,177 --> 01:00:39,245
- Everybody, wait.
- Hold on.

708
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:40,784
- You just stay with me.
- Okay.

709
01:00:41,053 --> 01:00:42,008
Grab my jacket.

710
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:43,695
Everybody back up.

711
01:00:43,972 --> 01:00:44,961
Back up.

712
01:00:45,223 --> 01:00:46,576
I got you, Ferrier.

713
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:48,567
- Oh, Jesus.
- You okay?

714
01:00:48,851 --> 01:00:49,804
- Yeah.
- Come on.

715
01:00:50,058 --> 01:00:51,855
- Okay, Jesus. Oh, my God.
- Come on.

716
01:00:52,603 --> 01:00:54,194
Watch out.

717
01:01:01,527 --> 01:01:02,481
Come on.

718
01:01:04,028 --> 01:01:05,586
Oh, Ray.

719
01:01:05,864 --> 01:01:07,581
Ray!

720
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:10,257
Come on. Come on.

721
01:01:12,327 --> 01:01:14,045
Go. I can go with him.

722
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:15,969
Sheryl?

723
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:18,328
Go with them. Go.

724
01:01:18,624 --> 01:01:19,579
- Ray.
- Sheryl?

725
01:01:19,834 --> 01:01:21,391
- Everybody...
- Sheryl?

726
01:01:21,668 --> 01:01:24,341
- There's room on the boat.
- Let us through, goddamn it.

727
01:01:24,671 --> 01:01:26,581
- There's still room on the boat.
- She's a child.

728
01:01:26,881 --> 01:01:28,155
- Robbie.
- There's room on the...

729
01:01:28,424 --> 01:01:31,495
There's still room on the boat.
There's room on the boat.

730
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,272
- Robbie.
- Just stay with me.

731
01:01:38,557 --> 01:01:40,433
Stay with me, Robbie.

732
01:01:44,268 --> 01:01:45,747
Robbie!

733
01:02:10,873 --> 01:02:13,023
- Robbie, Robbie.
- Robbie!

734
01:02:13,334 --> 01:02:15,211
Robbie!

735
01:02:18,838 --> 01:02:20,475
- Robbie.
- Come on.

736
01:02:21,215 --> 01:02:23,524
Here. Grab my hand.

737
01:02:23,842 --> 01:02:24,796
Here. Hold on.

738
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,796
I got you. Hold on.

739
01:02:28,096 --> 01:02:29,813
Take my hand.

740
01:02:30,097 --> 01:02:31,974
Take it. Take my hand.

741
01:02:32,266 --> 01:02:33,585
Here!

742
01:02:54,033 --> 01:02:56,388
Oh, my God.

743
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:16,295
Robbie!

744
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:02,540
Swim. Swim this way!

745
01:04:56,295 --> 01:04:59,207
- Robbie, help me with her.
- Here, Rach.

746
01:05:02,092 --> 01:05:04,526
Don't stop. Don't stop.

747
01:05:05,219 --> 01:05:06,811
Don't stop.

748
01:05:23,691 --> 01:05:25,522
Oh, my God.

749
01:06:28,576 --> 01:06:30,612
Robbie, slow down.

750
01:06:40,502 --> 01:06:41,854
Robbie, slow down.

751
01:06:55,973 --> 01:06:58,691
- Robbie.
- We gotta stay together, Robbie.

752
01:07:01,101 --> 01:07:02,500
Robbie?

753
01:07:02,895 --> 01:07:04,010
Stay together.

754
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:05,749
Robbie!

755
01:07:09,149 --> 01:07:11,185
Get back here!

756
01:07:15,905 --> 01:07:17,224
Robbie!

757
01:07:17,490 --> 01:07:19,284
No, Robbie!

758
01:07:19,573 --> 01:07:20,688
Come back!

759
01:07:28,497 --> 01:07:30,055
Robbie.

760
01:07:30,332 --> 01:07:32,049
Don't move. Don't move.

761
01:07:32,333 --> 01:07:35,006
Now for God's sake, stay right here.
I'm coming right back.

762
01:07:35,336 --> 01:07:37,212
- Robbie!
- Stop those people.

763
01:07:37,504 --> 01:07:39,381
- Turn around. Turn around.
- Robbie.

764
01:07:40,216 --> 01:07:41,489
Robbie.

765
01:07:41,758 --> 01:07:42,907
Robbie.

766
01:07:43,176 --> 01:07:44,291
What the hell?

767
01:07:44,553 --> 01:07:46,508
Why are you doing this?

768
01:07:49,890 --> 01:07:53,165
Pull back.
Five hundred meters to my 10 o'clock.

769
01:07:55,353 --> 01:07:57,423
Jekyll, no effect on target.
No effect.

770
01:07:57,730 --> 01:07:58,719
Roger. No effect.

771
01:07:59,107 --> 01:08:01,744
Our mission, lieutenant,
is to delay their advance

772
01:08:02,066 --> 01:08:04,453
till those refugees get to safety.
Now, keep firing.

773
01:08:06,986 --> 01:08:09,704
You've gotta listen. Turn around!
I want you to listen to me.

774
01:08:12,907 --> 01:08:13,862
Listen to me.

775
01:08:14,116 --> 01:08:15,595
Go back down the hill!

776
01:08:15,868 --> 01:08:18,017
All of you, just turn around!

777
01:08:30,672 --> 01:08:32,741
- Don't do this. I know you wanna fight.
- I wanna be here.

778
01:08:33,049 --> 01:08:34,004
I need to see this.

779
01:08:34,258 --> 01:08:35,691
It seems like you have to,
but you don't.

780
01:08:35,968 --> 01:08:37,606
- Please, let me go.
- You don't.

781
01:08:37,886 --> 01:08:39,877
Okay. Wait. Wait.

782
01:08:40,389 --> 01:08:42,026
What are you doing here
all by yourself?

783
01:08:42,307 --> 01:08:43,786
Sweetie, you gotta come with us,
please.

784
01:08:44,058 --> 01:08:45,933
No. My dad's getting my brother.
I have to stay here.

785
01:08:46,225 --> 01:08:47,294
- You can't stay here.
- Gotta go.

786
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,073
- I'm not gonna leave her alone.
- Leave.

787
01:08:49,354 --> 01:08:51,105
I'm not letting you do this.
You can hate me.

788
01:08:51,396 --> 01:08:52,511
- You can hate me.
- Let me go.

789
01:08:52,773 --> 01:08:53,728
- But I love you.
- Please.

790
01:08:53,982 --> 01:08:55,130
- I'm not letting you do this.
- Dad.

791
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,755
I can't. No. Please.
Please don't pull me.

792
01:08:58,069 --> 01:09:00,536
It's gonna be okay. You need
to come with us. It is not safe...

793
01:09:00,863 --> 01:09:02,455
Please. I can't go with you.

794
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:04,092
- My dad's right there.
- Please, come.

795
01:09:04,364 --> 01:09:06,036
- Please, my dad's right there.
- Listen to me...

796
01:09:06,325 --> 01:09:08,758
I need to be here. I want to see this.

797
01:09:09,243 --> 01:09:11,552
Wait. Wait... Just stay for Rachel.
Stay for your sister.

798
01:09:11,871 --> 01:09:15,226
Please, let me go.
You need to let me go.

799
01:09:18,877 --> 01:09:19,832
All right. Okay. All right.

800
01:09:20,086 --> 01:09:21,280
- You're coming with us.
- Dad.

801
01:09:21,546 --> 01:09:23,297
- We're going now.
- I can't.

802
01:09:23,589 --> 01:09:24,908
Dad!

803
01:09:28,925 --> 01:09:29,960
Dad.

804
01:09:31,385 --> 01:09:33,216
Dad!

805
01:09:38,349 --> 01:09:41,101
Let me go! Dad!

806
01:09:43,437 --> 01:09:44,472
Guide on. Guide on.

807
01:09:44,729 --> 01:09:46,640
Black Six. Attack. Attack. Attack.

808
01:09:49,233 --> 01:09:50,666
Stop.

809
01:09:51,026 --> 01:09:53,698
- That's my dad.
- I'm her father. I'm her father.

810
01:09:54,029 --> 01:09:55,906
- We're so sorry.
- We thought she was alone.

811
01:09:56,197 --> 01:09:59,472
- She was standing by the tree...
- She's fine. Let's go! Let's go!

812
01:10:02,911 --> 01:10:04,105
Robbie.

813
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:16,685
Robbie!

814
01:10:35,019 --> 01:10:36,338
Over here.

815
01:10:36,604 --> 01:10:37,673
Over here!

816
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:43,208
Hurry.

817
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,513
Are you all right?

818
01:11:04,835 --> 01:11:06,188
Hey.

819
01:11:08,338 --> 01:11:10,453
What about you, huh?

820
01:11:24,142 --> 01:11:25,859
There you go.

821
01:11:27,519 --> 01:11:29,396
Is that comfortable?

822
01:11:31,439 --> 01:11:33,907
I need you to close
your eyes now, okay?

823
01:11:34,276 --> 01:11:36,027
You need some sleep.

824
01:11:38,362 --> 01:11:39,758
Dad?

825
01:11:40,027 --> 01:11:41,665
He's gonna meet us.

826
01:11:42,864 --> 01:11:44,979
Hey. Robbie's gonna meet us, Rach.

827
01:11:45,282 --> 01:11:47,512
In Boston, at your grandma's.

828
01:11:47,826 --> 01:11:50,817
What do you think
Mom's doing right this minute?

829
01:11:51,162 --> 01:11:52,561
Mom?

830
01:11:53,747 --> 01:11:55,738
Boston. She's waiting.

831
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:59,605
And I know she's not sleeping,
because she is so worried about you.

832
01:11:59,961 --> 01:12:01,440
And she's in Grandma's kitchen,

833
01:12:01,713 --> 01:12:03,111
and she's...

834
01:12:04,965 --> 01:12:07,717
She's making that awful tea
she makes.

835
01:12:08,051 --> 01:12:09,803
And they're all just...

836
01:12:10,595 --> 01:12:13,790
They're all just counting the minutes
until they see you again.

837
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:17,459
What is this?

838
01:12:17,725 --> 01:12:18,999
What is this?

839
01:12:19,727 --> 01:12:20,795
I won.

840
01:12:21,061 --> 01:12:22,254
You won?

841
01:12:22,519 --> 01:12:24,635
The walk, trot and canter.

842
01:12:24,939 --> 01:12:26,769
Third place.

843
01:12:35,155 --> 01:12:37,749
Sing me "Lullaby and Goodnight. "

844
01:12:42,036 --> 01:12:43,866
I don't know that one.

845
01:12:44,996 --> 01:12:46,952
Sing me "Hushabye Mountain. "

846
01:12:50,626 --> 01:12:51,741
I'm sorry, Rach. I don't...

847
01:12:52,003 --> 01:12:53,958
I don't know that one either.

848
01:13:15,188 --> 01:13:18,462
<i>I'm not bragging, babe
So don't put me down</i>

849
01:13:19,273 --> 01:13:22,264
<i>'Cause I got the fastest
Set of wheels in town</i>

850
01:13:22,609 --> 01:13:25,520
<i>Something comes up to me
They don't even try</i>

851
01:13:27,363 --> 01:13:30,672
<i>'Cause if I had a set of wings
Man, you know she could fly</i>

852
01:13:31,283 --> 01:13:33,716
<i>She's my little deuce coupe</i>

853
01:13:34,661 --> 01:13:36,936
<i>You don't know what I got</i>

854
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:40,639
<i>Just my little deuce coupe</i>

855
01:13:43,126 --> 01:13:45,242
<i>You don't know what I got</i>

856
01:13:53,633 --> 01:13:55,191
Peach schnapps.

857
01:13:55,468 --> 01:13:56,980
Disgusting, I know it.

858
01:13:57,261 --> 01:13:59,456
Found a whole case of this shit.

859
01:14:06,226 --> 01:14:07,864
Thank you.

860
01:14:13,108 --> 01:14:15,098
I'm sorry about your son.

861
01:14:15,401 --> 01:14:16,880
We got separated. He's...

862
01:14:17,153 --> 01:14:20,109
He's gonna meet us in Boston.

863
01:14:26,868 --> 01:14:27,823
Did you...?

864
01:14:30,329 --> 01:14:32,478
Did you lose anybody?

865
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:36,295
All of them.

866
01:14:39,210 --> 01:14:41,644
Harlan Ogilvy.

867
01:14:42,713 --> 01:14:44,032
Ray Ferrier.

868
01:14:44,298 --> 01:14:45,856
I got water.

869
01:14:47,217 --> 01:14:49,287
Food enough for weeks.

870
01:14:50,262 --> 01:14:52,855
You're welcome to stay. Both of youse.

871
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:54,772
I'm sorry.

872
01:14:55,933 --> 01:14:57,888
I'm gonna get some sleep.

873
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:02,161
Those machines, those...

874
01:15:02,522 --> 01:15:04,558
...Tripods they got?

875
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:08,731
They buried them.

876
01:15:09,737 --> 01:15:11,806
Right under our feet.

877
01:15:12,989 --> 01:15:14,899
Since before there...

878
01:15:15,364 --> 01:15:17,514
There were even people here.

879
01:15:18,368 --> 01:15:21,165
They've been planning this
for a million years.

880
01:15:23,162 --> 01:15:24,594
We're beat to shit.

881
01:15:24,871 --> 01:15:25,940
Please.

882
01:15:26,206 --> 01:15:28,242
- My daughter...
- Think about it.

883
01:15:31,586 --> 01:15:34,861
They defeated the greatest power
in the world in a couple days.

884
01:15:35,214 --> 01:15:37,170
Walked right over us.

885
01:15:37,632 --> 01:15:40,351
And these are only the first.
They'll keep coming.

886
01:15:41,886 --> 01:15:43,159
This is not a war

887
01:15:43,429 --> 01:15:46,227
any more than there's
a war between men and maggots.

888
01:15:46,806 --> 01:15:49,366
This is an extermination.

889
01:15:59,607 --> 01:16:01,358
Are you afraid?

890
01:16:03,110 --> 01:16:04,782
Of course I am.

891
01:16:07,447 --> 01:16:09,755
I been around death plenty.

892
01:16:10,949 --> 01:16:12,541
I drive an ambulance in the city...

893
01:16:12,826 --> 01:16:15,134
Drove an ambulance in the city.

894
01:16:15,453 --> 01:16:17,762
That's all over now, huh?

895
01:16:20,916 --> 01:16:23,634
You know the people
that make it, Ray?

896
01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:27,406
The ones that don't flatline
before the hospital?

897
01:16:30,048 --> 01:16:32,925
It's the ones
that keep their eyes open.

898
01:16:33,759 --> 01:16:34,987
That keep looking at you.

899
01:16:35,261 --> 01:16:36,774
Keep thinking.

900
01:16:37,054 --> 01:16:39,283
They're the ones that survive.

901
01:16:41,057 --> 01:16:43,285
We can't lose our heads, Ray.

902
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:46,822
Running.

903
01:16:47,478 --> 01:16:49,355
That's what'll kill you.

904
01:16:51,064 --> 01:16:53,532
And I'm dead set on living.

905
01:16:59,030 --> 01:17:01,179
Dead set on living...

906
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:06,224
Thank you for taking us in.

907
01:17:13,292 --> 01:17:15,486
Not gonna be exterminated.

908
01:17:31,305 --> 01:17:32,942
It's okay. Come on.

909
01:17:33,222 --> 01:17:34,860
I wanna show you something.

910
01:17:35,850 --> 01:17:37,282
We're gonna fight them, Ray.

911
01:17:37,559 --> 01:17:38,674
They gotta have a weakness.

912
01:17:38,936 --> 01:17:40,494
Come on. Take a look.

913
01:17:48,402 --> 01:17:50,631
Somehow they killed
a few of these things in Osaka.

914
01:17:50,945 --> 01:17:51,900
That's what I heard.

915
01:17:52,155 --> 01:17:54,430
You telling me the Japanese
can figure it out, but we can't?

916
01:17:54,741 --> 01:17:56,093
We can do this, Ray.

917
01:17:56,367 --> 01:17:58,039
We can do it. We can get them.

918
01:17:58,327 --> 01:18:00,078
We can figure it out.

919
01:18:00,745 --> 01:18:02,463
Stay right there.

920
01:18:21,845 --> 01:18:23,562
I have a daughter.

921
01:18:23,846 --> 01:18:25,165
Why did you bring us here?

922
01:18:25,431 --> 01:18:27,990
To fight them together, Ray.

923
01:18:28,349 --> 01:18:31,657
Now we'll be the ones coming up
from underground.

924
01:18:33,353 --> 01:18:34,502
When the time is right...

925
01:18:35,355 --> 01:18:37,549
...take them by surprise,
the way they took us.

926
01:18:38,691 --> 01:18:40,806
Take them by surprise.

927
01:18:42,026 --> 01:18:43,300
We're right under their feet, Ray.

928
01:18:43,570 --> 01:18:46,322
Right here. Under their feet.

929
01:19:35,068 --> 01:19:36,944
You miss your mommy?

930
01:19:37,737 --> 01:19:39,773
I had a little girl.

931
01:19:40,572 --> 01:19:41,925
Nearly your age.

932
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,588
You know, if anything happens
to your daddy,

933
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:47,423
I'll take care of you.

934
01:19:47,703 --> 01:19:49,056
Rachel.

935
01:19:57,211 --> 01:19:59,121
You don't have
anything to say to her.

936
01:19:59,421 --> 01:20:00,900
Do you understand?

937
01:20:01,673 --> 01:20:03,231
If you wanna talk to somebody,

938
01:20:03,508 --> 01:20:04,987
if you wanna ask a question,
you ask me.

939
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:07,615
What exactly is your plan, Ray?

940
01:20:07,929 --> 01:20:10,726
I know what I'm gonna do.
How about you?

941
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:14,013
You gonna sit here?
Wait for them to come get you?

942
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:16,068
Is that your plan?

943
01:20:17,853 --> 01:20:19,967
Maybe you wanna get caught.

944
01:20:20,437 --> 01:20:23,792
Couple days hiding in a basement
too much for you, I bet.

945
01:20:24,148 --> 01:20:25,740
You'll probably turn yourself right in.

946
01:20:29,945 --> 01:20:31,218
Listen.

947
01:20:32,614 --> 01:20:33,842
It stopped.

948
01:20:34,115 --> 01:20:35,343
Maybe you'll be okay.

949
01:20:35,616 --> 01:20:38,254
Maybe you'll get lucky,
and they'll train you as their pet.

950
01:20:38,576 --> 01:20:41,373
You know, feed you,
train you how to do tricks.

951
01:20:41,703 --> 01:20:42,852
Will you shut up and listen?

952
01:22:40,547 --> 01:22:41,741
<i>No.</i>

953
01:22:44,383 --> 01:22:45,862
<i>No. No.</i>

954
01:22:47,386 --> 01:22:48,613
No.

955
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:14,482
Give me that.

956
01:28:48,004 --> 01:28:49,676
You and me...

957
01:28:51,006 --> 01:28:53,884
...I don't think
we're on the same page.

958
01:29:30,537 --> 01:29:33,050
Ray. Ray.

959
01:29:33,372 --> 01:29:35,966
Ray. Ray. Ray!

960
01:29:36,292 --> 01:29:37,724
Ray!

961
01:29:38,001 --> 01:29:40,719
Keep your voice down. Quiet!

962
01:30:22,285 --> 01:30:24,844
Not my blood. Not my blood.

963
01:30:27,956 --> 01:30:29,787
Not my blood.

964
01:30:30,876 --> 01:30:32,786
Not my...

965
01:30:33,252 --> 01:30:34,651
Not...

966
01:30:35,838 --> 01:30:37,111
...my...

967
01:30:39,424 --> 01:30:41,175
Not my blood.

968
01:30:42,009 --> 01:30:43,328
Not my blood.

969
01:30:43,594 --> 01:30:45,072
Not my blood.

970
01:30:45,345 --> 01:30:46,619
Not my blood.

971
01:30:47,181 --> 01:30:48,500
Not my blood.

972
01:30:48,766 --> 01:30:50,244
- Not my blood.
- Stop it.

973
01:30:50,516 --> 01:30:51,949
- Stop it.
- Not my blood.

974
01:30:52,227 --> 01:30:53,376
- Stop it.
- Not my blood.

975
01:30:53,645 --> 01:30:55,077
You gotta be quiet.

976
01:30:55,354 --> 01:30:57,106
- You want them to hear you?
- They drink us.

977
01:30:57,398 --> 01:30:59,194
- Please, they'll hear you.
- They drink us.

978
01:30:59,482 --> 01:31:02,235
Then they spray us, like fertilizer.

979
01:31:02,569 --> 01:31:03,762
You gotta be quiet.

980
01:31:04,028 --> 01:31:06,622
- Drink us, and...
- They're gonna come back down here.

981
01:31:06,947 --> 01:31:08,979
Then they spit us out all over
the goddamn red weeds.

982
01:31:10,113 --> 01:31:11,831
Do you understand
what I'm gonna have to do?

983
01:31:12,115 --> 01:31:13,752
I can't let my daughter die
because of you.

984
01:31:14,033 --> 01:31:15,864
This tunnel will get us to the city.

985
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:17,751
We'll have tunnels there.
Ready-made.

986
01:31:18,036 --> 01:31:19,515
- Stop it.
- Subway. See what I'm saying?

987
01:31:19,788 --> 01:31:21,016
- Hide an army down there.
- Stop it.

988
01:31:21,290 --> 01:31:22,768
We'll go underground.
Sneak attacks at night.

989
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:24,393
You stop it!

990
01:31:26,418 --> 01:31:29,376
We're the resistance, Ray.
They can't occupy this country.

991
01:31:29,713 --> 01:31:32,943
Occupations always fail. History's
taught us that a thousand times.

992
01:31:33,299 --> 01:31:35,493
This is our land.

993
01:31:35,801 --> 01:31:38,838
We eat it, we breathe it,
only we can live on it.

994
01:31:39,179 --> 01:31:41,817
They can't survive here, Ray.
They weren't built for it.

995
01:31:43,183 --> 01:31:45,218
They're gonna kill you, brother,
not me!

996
01:31:45,517 --> 01:31:47,826
- What are you doing, Dad?
- Not my blood!

997
01:31:48,145 --> 01:31:51,135
Whatever you hear,
don't take this off.

998
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:52,879
- Dad?
- Rach?

999
01:31:53,148 --> 01:31:55,377
- Dad?
- What was that song?

1000
01:31:55,692 --> 01:31:59,081
- That lullaby that I didn't know?
- Not my blood!

1001
01:31:59,445 --> 01:32:01,163
- "Hushabye Mountain"?
- Yeah, sing it.

1002
01:32:01,447 --> 01:32:04,085
- They can take you!
- Please, Rach, sing it.

1003
01:32:04,407 --> 01:32:07,444
<i>- They can take you!
- A gentle breeze</i>

1004
01:32:07,785 --> 01:32:09,264
- Your daughter!
- Don't stop.

1005
01:32:09,537 --> 01:32:11,891
<i>- Not me!
- On Hushabye Mountain</i>

1006
01:32:12,204 --> 01:32:13,717
- They're gonna kill you!
- That's my girl.

1007
01:32:13,998 --> 01:32:18,388
<i>Softly blows over Lullaby Bay</i>

1008
01:32:19,085 --> 01:32:23,202
<i>- Forget it! Tunnel!
- It fills the sails</i>

1009
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:26,853
<i>Of boats that are waiting</i>

1010
01:32:28,677 --> 01:32:33,351
<i>Waiting to sail
Your worries away</i>

1011
01:32:35,473 --> 01:32:42,230
<i>So close your eyes
On Hushabye Mountain</i>

1012
01:32:43,647 --> 01:32:47,958
<i>Wave goodbye
To cares of the day</i>

1013
01:32:48,859 --> 01:32:53,773
<i>And watch your boat
From Hushabye Mountain</i>

1014
01:32:54,197 --> 01:32:59,907
<i>Sail far away
From Lullaby Bay</i>

1015
01:34:52,664 --> 01:34:54,177
Rachel?

1016
01:34:54,750 --> 01:34:56,263
Rachel?

1017
01:34:57,044 --> 01:34:58,874
Oh, my God, no.

1018
01:35:02,464 --> 01:35:03,897
Rachel?

1019
01:35:04,174 --> 01:35:05,653
Rachel? Rachel?

1020
01:35:16,976 --> 01:35:19,410
Rachel? Make some noise, baby.

1021
01:35:19,728 --> 01:35:20,716
Rachel?

1022
01:35:22,563 --> 01:35:24,281
Rachel?

1023
01:35:28,817 --> 01:35:31,455
Rachel? Talk to me, baby. Come on.

1024
01:35:35,322 --> 01:35:37,199
Rachel?

1025
01:35:40,034 --> 01:35:42,025
Rachel?

1026
01:35:55,839 --> 01:35:57,635
Rachel?

1027
01:35:57,924 --> 01:35:59,642
Rachel!

1028
01:37:06,478 --> 01:37:08,389
No, no, no!

1029
01:37:08,730 --> 01:37:10,082
No!

1030
01:37:40,962 --> 01:37:42,872
Hey!

1031
01:38:22,121 --> 01:38:24,076
Help!

1032
01:38:26,166 --> 01:38:28,883
What is happening?

1033
01:38:31,544 --> 01:38:32,533
Rachel!

1034
01:39:04,446 --> 01:39:06,117
Rachel.

1035
01:39:06,405 --> 01:39:09,202
Rachel. Rachel.

1036
01:39:10,033 --> 01:39:11,864
Rachel.

1037
01:39:13,161 --> 01:39:15,037
Rachel?

1038
01:39:16,247 --> 01:39:17,965
Rachel.

1039
01:39:18,915 --> 01:39:19,870
Dad.

1040
01:39:47,186 --> 01:39:48,744
No!

1041
01:39:49,856 --> 01:39:52,323
Pull me! Pull me!

1042
01:39:59,197 --> 01:40:01,551
Pull! Pull!

1043
01:40:01,865 --> 01:40:04,332
Pull me! Come on, pull!

1044
01:40:07,787 --> 01:40:10,141
- Dad!
- One, two, three!

1045
01:40:10,456 --> 01:40:13,652
We got him! Keep pulling!

1046
01:40:20,965 --> 01:40:23,432
Everybody down!

1047
01:41:16,049 --> 01:41:17,482
Keep it moving, folks.

1048
01:41:20,636 --> 01:41:22,910
Keep going, sir. Keep moving.

1049
01:41:23,221 --> 01:41:25,610
I don't know what's going on.

1050
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:29,431
Hold Grandma's hand.

1051
01:41:31,603 --> 01:41:34,913
Let's go, folks.
Keep moving forward.

1052
01:41:45,322 --> 01:41:46,994
Put that down.

1053
01:41:49,576 --> 01:41:52,294
Right this way, ma'am.
Right this way, thank you.

1054
01:42:00,541 --> 01:42:03,338
To the left, there, ma'am,
just to your left. Thank you.

1055
01:42:05,587 --> 01:42:07,578
What happened to it?

1056
01:42:11,759 --> 01:42:13,191
It's dying.

1057
01:42:15,762 --> 01:42:17,353
Keep moving forward.

1058
01:42:27,981 --> 01:42:29,334
Keep moving, it's all right!

1059
01:42:29,607 --> 01:42:31,198
You can pass on through.
Move along!

1060
01:42:31,483 --> 01:42:32,711
- What happened here?
- I don't know.

1061
01:42:32,985 --> 01:42:34,782
Something's happening to them.
Please, keep moving.

1062
01:42:35,070 --> 01:42:36,502
- Let's go, move out.
- Let's go, people.

1063
01:42:36,780 --> 01:42:39,737
- Something's happening to them?
- Go. Go, just keep moving, sir.

1064
01:42:40,074 --> 01:42:42,506
Let's go, sir. Let's go. Do not stop.
Keep moving. Keep moving.

1065
01:42:42,825 --> 01:42:44,894
Excuse me. What's happened here?
Did you guys take it down?

1066
01:42:45,201 --> 01:42:47,271
No, sir, it was behaving erratically,
walking in circles,

1067
01:42:47,579 --> 01:42:49,330
then it went down on its own
about an hour ago.

1068
01:42:49,621 --> 01:42:52,260
Now, please, let's go! Let's go!
Keep moving! Come on! Don't stop!

1069
01:42:52,583 --> 01:42:54,538
Do not stop! Let's go! Thank you!

1070
01:42:56,127 --> 01:42:57,924
How is it dead all by itself?

1071
01:42:58,213 --> 01:43:00,601
- Rachel, I'm not sure.
- Coming through.

1072
01:43:00,923 --> 01:43:03,834
Coming through. Make a hole.
Coming through.

1073
01:43:23,941 --> 01:43:26,056
Calm down.
Calm down and get in the tunnel.

1074
01:43:26,359 --> 01:43:29,351
Calm down and get in the tunnel.
Calm down and get in the tunnel.

1075
01:43:41,706 --> 01:43:44,173
Everybody calm down.
Get in the tunnel.

1076
01:43:44,498 --> 01:43:46,887
- On the other side of the tracks!
- Hey! Hey!

1077
01:43:50,712 --> 01:43:52,191
Look at the birds!

1078
01:43:52,464 --> 01:43:53,942
I can't hear you!

1079
01:43:54,215 --> 01:43:56,888
Look at the goddamn birds!

1080
01:43:59,887 --> 01:44:02,162
- No shield!
- I can't hear!

1081
01:44:02,473 --> 01:44:04,190
No shield!

1082
01:44:08,058 --> 01:44:10,208
The Javelin's the key!

1083
01:44:10,519 --> 01:44:13,157
Load the Gustav!
It's gonna be a tough kill!

1084
01:44:13,479 --> 01:44:14,468
Let's go!

1085
01:44:17,023 --> 01:44:18,138
It's safer in here.

1086
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:20,152
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1087
01:44:20,444 --> 01:44:21,956
Bring out the Javelin!

1088
01:44:30,576 --> 01:44:32,771
Clear! Get from behind! Clear!

1089
01:44:42,087 --> 01:44:44,316
- Let me know when you're tracking!
- Tracking!

1090
01:44:44,630 --> 01:44:46,143
- You got a lock?
- I got a lock!

1091
01:44:46,423 --> 01:44:48,014
Fire the Javelin!

1092
01:44:54,887 --> 01:44:57,117
- I got a lock!
- Fire the Javelin!

1093
01:45:00,433 --> 01:45:01,786
Fire!

1094
01:45:16,279 --> 01:45:17,951
It's okay.

1095
01:45:19,241 --> 01:45:20,992
I love you.

1096
01:45:21,283 --> 01:45:23,797
- It's okay. You're gonna be okay.
- Let's go!

1097
01:45:25,328 --> 01:45:27,319
Keep those civilians out of there.

1098
01:45:27,622 --> 01:45:31,296
Back. Stay back!
Come on, folks, back up!

1099
01:45:36,504 --> 01:45:39,575
Come on, guys, get on the line.
Get up there now.

1100
01:45:40,340 --> 01:45:43,093
Stay back. Stay right here, huh?
Hold on right there.

1101
01:45:49,014 --> 01:45:51,652
- It's opening.
- It's opening. Keep them back.

1102
01:46:31,088 --> 01:46:32,601
Clear!

1103
01:46:32,881 --> 01:46:36,111
No, keep them back, keep them back.
Come on, stay back.

1104
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:13,621
Mom!

1105
01:47:40,477 --> 01:47:42,591
Thank you.

1106
01:48:05,745 --> 01:48:07,417
- Robbie?
- Robbie?

1107
01:48:14,045 --> 01:48:15,955
Hi, Dad.

1108
01:48:16,588 --> 01:48:18,180
Hi, Dad.

1109
01:48:19,007 --> 01:48:20,598
Hi, Dad.

1110
01:48:55,119 --> 01:48:57,313
<i>From the moment
the invaders arrived,</i>

1111
01:48:57,620 --> 01:49:00,849
<i>breathed our air, ate and drank,</i>

1112
01:49:01,205 --> 01:49:02,797
<i>they were doomed.</i>

1113
01:49:03,875 --> 01:49:06,946
<i>They were undone, destroyed,</i>

1114
01:49:07,294 --> 01:49:10,409
<i>after all of man's weapons
and devices had failed,</i>

1115
01:49:10,754 --> 01:49:15,508
<i>by the tiniest creatures that God
in his wisdom put upon this Earth.</i>

1116
01:49:16,843 --> 01:49:20,278
<i>By the toll of a billion deaths,
man had earned his immunity,</i>

1117
01:49:20,637 --> 01:49:24,993
<i>his right to survive among
this planet's infinite organisms.</i>

1118
01:49:26,476 --> 01:49:29,990
<i>And that right is ours
against all challenges,</i>

1119
01:49:30,354 --> 01:49:36,030
<i>for neither do men live,
nor die, in vain.</i>
