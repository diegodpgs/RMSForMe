00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,113
<i># Send in the Klowns</i>

00:01:40,213 --> 00:01:42,327

<i># From outer space</i>

28
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,323
<i>There's cotton candy in their hands... </i>

29
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,970
Little son of a bitch.

30
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:18,860
Cops.

31
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,442
This is Mooney calling.

32
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,992
<i>I hear you. What's going on?</i>

33
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,178
Nothing yet, Dave...

34
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:30,007
...but Friday night's just started.

35
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:35,377
I'm getting started across down at the park.
Check in with you later.

36
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:37,339
<i>That was a hot tune from The Doorman... </i>

37
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,072
<i>... but now we'll gonna slow it down a bit... </i>

38
00:02:39,172 --> 00:02:43,022
<i>... for all you makeout artists</i>
<i>at the "top of the world"</i>

39
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:50,868
Give me a cold one.

40
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,099
Fine.

41
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:09,390
<i>I am Jojo, the clown ice cream clown,</i>
<i>with the bestest ice cream in town. </i>

42
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:12,037
<i>We'll give you the stick,</i>

43
00:03:12,137 --> 00:03:14,842
<i>... and you give it a lick</i>
<i>that'll tickle you all the way down. </i>

44
00:03:14,942 --> 00:03:16,377
<i>Ice cream, ice cream. </i>

45
00:03:16,412 --> 00:03:21,802
<i>We brought it to make it easier for you,</i>
<i>our tasty cream while you're through. </i>

46
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,232
<i>Let's take a break!</i>

47
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:29,074
Cool off those hot lips
with our tasty frozen fruity bars...

48
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:30,656
...icy whiteys..

49
00:03:30,756 --> 00:03:32,335
Fudgy wudgy bars...

50
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:36,116
...and everyone's favorite frozen delight:
The licker stick!

51
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,885
- Jeez, what the...?
- Get outta here, you morons!

52
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:42,236
<i>- Hey! Take your ice cream and get lost!</i>
- Oh yeah?

53
00:03:42,336 --> 00:03:45,486
<i>Shut it down, and turn the speaker off. </i>

54
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,073
<i>Now beat it, you jerk!</i>

55
00:03:47,173 --> 00:03:50,497
So you don't want any ice cream?
Well, you're not gettin' any!

56
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,199
We were getting it
before you showed up.

57
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,589
Those guys...
What the hell are they doing here?

58
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,117
Great idea, Paul.
"Everybody loves ice cream. "

59
00:03:59,217 --> 00:04:04,817
What do you mean? It was your idea. Hey.
Why don't we just park here for a while?

60
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:09,155
Hey... What are you
guys trying to pull here?

61
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,885
We... we thought we'd park here for a while.

62
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,437
You said we could have
all the ice cream we wanted

63
00:04:14,537 --> 00:04:16,669
...but didn't say anything about parking.

64
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:19,289
What kind of girls you think we are?

65
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,979
<i>I told you they weren't that stupid. </i>

66
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,810
- We want you to takes us home right now.
<i>- Yeah. </i>

67
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,799
Take it easy...
Keep your shirt on.

68
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,719
Don't worry, we intend to.

69
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,773
<i>Well, this worked out just great. </i>

70
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:36,022
<i> Don't blame me. </i>
<i>I didn't wanna come here. </i>

71
00:04:36,122 --> 00:04:39,712
<i> - Hey, why don't we try the drive in?</i>
<i> - Oh, that's dumb. </i>

72
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,912
<i>Wait a minute. What's playing?</i>

73
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:44,444
Knuckleheads.

74
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,199
Did you know those guys?

75
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:48,434
These guys are my best friends from school.

76
00:04:48,534 --> 00:04:52,091
Whenever I wanna have a good time,
I call Rich and Paul.

77
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:54,361
A night out with those types...

78
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,874
...is a total adventure.

79
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:03,926
What am I talking about
the Terenzio brothers for

80
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,502
I would much rather...

81
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:07,899
kissing you...

82
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,779
This is great.

83
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,318
Yeah.

84
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,103
Oh, check that out!

85
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,189
- Did you see that?
- Yes, I saw that.

86
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:43,689
That was incredible.

87
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:56,317
Did you see that little sky
zip down over there, Pooh?

88
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:03,038
It is Halley's comet
and it has landed in our backyard!

89
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,732
There's gonna be thousands of people!

90
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:10,172
Thousands of people will be comin.
They're gonna have hot dogs.

91
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:13,406
They're gonna have helicopters and airplanes...

92
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:14,973
...and tacos.

93
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,125
This is our lucky day!

94
00:06:18,225 --> 00:06:21,703
We gonna be rich, Pooh.
We gonna be rich.

95
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,885
- Come on, let's go check it out.
- Oh, c'mon. No way.

96
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:28,871
It's a waste of time.
It's gotta be a thousand miles away.

97
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,238
Ruined our whole evening.

98
00:06:30,338 --> 00:06:32,539
Don't give me that.
You saw how close it was.

99
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,049
It landed right over the hill.
That is not a thousand miles way.

100
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:38,521
Come on.

101
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,824
You can find it, Mr. Adventure.

102
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:45,154
Debbie, don't you want
to finsih the champagne?

103
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,266
Take it with us.

104
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,564
Come on.

105
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,034
Okay.

106
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,305
Pooh.

107
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:57,646
Come on.

108
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,187
Attention, dog. Come on.

109
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,218
I'll be greased and fried...

110
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,750
What in blue blazes is a circus doing out
in these parts?

111
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,929
I love the circus.

112
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:20,794
Come on. Maybe we can
get us some free passes.

113
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:23,636
Come on, Pooh.

114
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:39,925
I have never seen one that looked like this before.

115
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,202
I don't know, Pooh.

116
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,899
You know, there's something kind of peculiar round here.

117
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,014
Where is everybody?

118
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,947
There ain't nobody around.

119
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,752
Where is the damn ticket booth?

120
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:21,358
How are we supposed to get in
and see the show?

121
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:35,803
Pooh?

122
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,707
Pooh Bear?

123
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,849
Where is that dog?

124
00:08:57,436 --> 00:09:00,236
Somethin' funny is happenin' round here.

125
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,708
What in tarnation's goin' on here?

126
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,349
Where is my dog?

127
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,560
Where is my Pooh Bear?

128
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:21,192
I'll tear this thing apart
with my bare hands!

129
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:32,701
This thing is wired.

130
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,181
Police station

131
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,078
Get in there!

132
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,658
What's going on, Curt?

133
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,900
Same old shit.

134
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,886
I got 'em boozin' it up in the park.

135
00:10:07,986 --> 00:10:12,345
We were just walking through the park on
our way to the dorm. We had a bottle of wine.

136
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,982
It's a beautiful night. We were walking around.
We didn't do nothing.

137
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,784
- You guys go to the college, right?
- Yeah, right.

138
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,215
So why don't you just stay there
and do your drinking on the campus?

139
00:10:21,315 --> 00:10:22,522
Why do you have to come into town?

140
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,624
Come on...
We live in this town, too.

141
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,093
I mean, we don't have to just stay on campus.

142
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,455
Yeah...

143
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,330
And it's scum like you
that is killing this town.

144
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,747
Come on, Curt!

145
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:34,846
Come on. Just take it easy!

146
00:10:34,946 --> 00:10:37,103
What's the matter with you, Dave?

147
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,863
You got a thing for these little boys?

148
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,800
Empty your pockets!

149
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:46,212
- We just had a little wine. What's the problem?
- You're the problem, you little shit!

150
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,179
Just lighten up, Mooney.
Just lighten up.

151
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:53,486
Back off, Dave. Open container,
public intoxication, littering,

152
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,188
disturbing the peace,
resisting arrest...

153
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:58,051
These kids are history.

154
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,774
Unless you wanna rewrite the laws,
Mr. Police Academy.

155
00:11:01,874 --> 00:11:04,713
Look, you got this problem with my training,
I don't care...

156
00:11:04,813 --> 00:11:06,377
...but if you bring someone into this station,

157
00:11:06,477 --> 00:11:07,849
I don't wanna see you beat 'em up.

158
00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:11,685
Now if you're gonna fuck 'em,
do it according to procedure, or I swear, Kurt...

159
00:11:11,785 --> 00:11:14,507
...you and that badge of yours will be history.

160
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,987
Tell you what's gonna be history -

161
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:19,875
These kids.

162
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,514
Now get them in there.

163
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,014
- Get in there!
- Shit.

164
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,335
It looks that we have to walk from here.

165
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,066
Let's see.

166
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:55,357
If instinct serve chief correct...

167
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,538
...path lie...

168
00:11:58,684 --> 00:11:59,673
...that way.

169
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,445
We must travel many moons...

170
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,551
Many...

171
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,988
...many moons. Many...

172
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,956
Enough already with the moons.

173
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,401
Lead the way, Chief Running-At-The-Mouth.

174
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:31,814
Holy shit!

175
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:35,588
That's not a shooting star. It looks like a-

176
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,158
...circus tent.

177
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:39,759
What does a circus tent all the way out here?

178
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,029
Pretty bad location for a show.

179
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,908
Something is wrong. This doesn't feel right.

180
00:12:45,008 --> 00:12:47,112
Well, weren't we looking for
the shooting star?

181
00:12:47,212 --> 00:12:49,314
Come on, this looks neat.
Let's check this out.

182
00:12:49,414 --> 00:12:50,380
No.

183
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,370
Let's go. I've seen enough.

184
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,037
Come on, Deb.

185
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,831
I want to take a closer look.
You can stay here.

186
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,067
Alone?

187
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,399
Would you be more scared if
you came with me...

188
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,466
...or if I left you here?

189
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,754
If you left me here. Let's go.

190
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,557
Come on. Come on.

191
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,896
Okay, okay. I'm coming.

192
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,092
Come on, let's check this out.

193
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:35,807
No, Mike.

194
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:37,640
We'd better not.

195
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,230
Deb, You'll gonna love this.
Don't be a baby.

196
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:57,905
This is bizarre.

197
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,430
What kind of circus is this?

198
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:04,392
It is that new wave European circus,
<i>Cirque Fantastique. "</i>

199
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,847
Hurry, hurry. Step right up.

200
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,062
<i>See the Circus Bizarro. </i>

201
00:14:10,162 --> 00:14:12,466
Come one, come all.
Step right up, little lady.

202
00:14:12,566 --> 00:14:14,687
Do not be shy. Do not be stupid.

203
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,801
Come see the incredible Miss 50-50...

204
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:20,401
...Half man, half woman...
The perfect double date.

205
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,674
Yes. That's my little lady.

206
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:25,698
Step right up here and see Gumbo,
the toothless elephant.

207
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:29,015
Or right over here, we've got Belinda,
the bulimic wonder.

208
00:14:29,115 --> 00:14:32,705
Watch here binge and purge
before your very eyes.

209
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:35,638
Mike, keep it down.
Somebody'll catch us.

210
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,877
God, is this place great or what?

211
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:41,310
<i>It looks as if it was decorated by
Clowns'R'Us. </i>

212
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:43,809
I don't know.

213
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:48,678
So how much further do you want to go?

214
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,192
Let's go til the end of the aisle,
where these doors are.

215
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,335
Come on.

216
00:15:17,323 --> 00:15:19,143
Woah!

217
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,956
This is not a fun house

218
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,522
Not a circus either.

219
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:42,930
What?

220
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,870
I don't believe this.

221
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:49,481
- What is it, a nuclear plant?
- No.

222
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,121
- A missile silo?
- No.

223
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,914
- A military base?
- No!

224
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,974
- The shooting star!
- What are you talking about?

225
00:16:04,074 --> 00:16:06,663
The shooting star we went to look for,
we are in it.

226
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,262
What was that?

227
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:11,929
I don't know...

228
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,242
...but it's coming this way.

229
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:17,434
Here. Come on.

230
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:38,064
Look at this place.

231
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,225
It smells like candy.

232
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:48,207
You know, I do not know what
we saw out there before, but...

233
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:51,037
this looks like a cotton candy factory.

234
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,705
Yeah!

235
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:58,317
This must be where they hang them
to dry before they ship the stuff out.

236
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:59,817
No, it is not.

237
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,555
I've never seen anything
like this before, have you?

238
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:04,644
No.

239
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,993
Well that's because nobody has.

240
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,253
I do not believe in UFOs...

241
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:16,131
...but if they do exist,
then we are trapped in one right now.

242
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:19,805
Will you just calm down? There's gotta be
a logical explanation for this.

243
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:22,145
This isn't what you think it is.

244
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,905
Nobody stores cotton candy like this.

245
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,515
What are you talking about?
Of course it is.

246
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:30,604
Look.

247
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:14,771
Joe Lombardo!

248
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:27,969
This way!

249
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:49,073
- Are you OK?
- I think so.

250
00:18:49,173 --> 00:18:50,150
Come on.

251
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,331
Popcorn? Why Popcorn?

252
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,881
Because they're clowns, that's why.

253
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,859
Mike, get me of here!

254
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,266
Hurry, they're coming!

255
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,523
We have to tell the police.

256
00:20:12,623 --> 00:20:14,529
Oh yeah, we'll go right into the station
and tell them there's a bunch of clowns...

257
00:20:14,629 --> 00:20:17,465
...running around in the hills and killing you
with cotton candy?

258
00:20:17,565 --> 00:20:21,132
I have a friend there.
I know he'll believe us.

259
00:20:21,232 --> 00:20:24,452
I do not know, Deb.
I wouldn't even believe us.

260
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,081
Crescent Cove - 5 miles

261
00:20:34,732 --> 00:20:36,232
Come brother.

262
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,422
What the hell?

263
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:15,256
Dave! Oh my God!
Something horrible has happened!

264
00:21:15,356 --> 00:21:18,057
- Somebody has been killed!
- Wait a second, Debbie. What happened?

265
00:21:18,157 --> 00:21:20,292
You've gotta help us!
We've gotta do something! 2 people dead!

266
00:21:20,392 --> 00:21:21,357
Who, Debbie, who's dead?

267
00:21:21,457 --> 00:21:23,865
- Joe Lombardo. He's dead.
- And some old man, too.

268
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:25,400
Wait a second, guys.
Are you sure about this?

269
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,269
Yes, you idiot! They were hanging there wrapped
up in these cotton candy things...

270
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:31,151
...these... cocoons.

271
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,281
- Cocoons?
- Yes, cocoons.

272
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:36,607
- You know, cocoons.
- Alright everybody, calm down.

273
00:21:36,707 --> 00:21:38,797
Look Debbie, come inside and explain this to me.

274
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:44,917
I'd like to help you, but before I can
I got to understand what's going on here myself.

275
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,700
Drugstore

276
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:58,807
<i>I really need this new makeup. </i>

277
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,019
<i>- Okay, I'll buy some over there at the drugstore. </i>
- Good. </i>

278
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,709
Okay? And then we'll go on.

279
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,479
Oh, look.

280
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,452
Cute.

281
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,034
Alright, sit down.

282
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:27,146
Let's start from the beginning.

283
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,698
<i>Okay. We were at The Top of the World... </i></i>

284
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,319
...and then we saw that shooting star
and we decided to go look for it.

285
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:38,056
But instead of finding the shooting star,
we saw this circus tent.

286
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:40,906
And that's when we went inside and that is
where we saw those people...

287
00:22:41,006 --> 00:22:43,596
...in those pink
cotton candy cocoons.

288
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:47,199
Dave, it was not a circus tent.
It was something else.

289
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,067
- What? What?
<i>- It was a spaceship,</i>

290
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,715
...and there were these things,
these- these killer clowns...

291
00:22:51,815 --> 00:22:55,595
<i>... and then they shot popcorn at us.
We barely escaped. </i>

292
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:00,270
Killer clowns from outer space?

293
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,446
Holy shit.

294
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:05,851
Dave, we are telling you the truth.
You gotta believe us.

295
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,452
Let me tell you something, honey.

296
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,389
I was just over there.
There's nothing goin' on.

297
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:13,025
Excuse me please,
but we are talking to Dave.

298
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:16,928
Now just hold on a second, Mooney. They say that
some people are dead. Let's hear them out.

299
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:18,154
Alright, Dave...

300
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,053
Okay.

301
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:22,029
Clowns, cotton candy...

302
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,794
...flying popcorn.

303
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:27,406
Go ahead. Let us make fools
out of the police department.

304
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:28,571
I told you I was
just over there!

305
00:23:28,671 --> 00:23:30,642
Are you gonna believe me or this little this little tramp?

306
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,107
Come on, Mooney!

307
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:34,701
I'm handling this, alright?

308
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:41,044
Alright, Debbie, who is your friend?

309
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,488
Mike. We go to school together.

310
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,458
You two were
<i>On Top of the World together?</i>

311
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:47,925
Yeah.

312
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,320
I know you, you little fart.

313
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,493
You hang out with the Terenzi brothers.

314
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,566
Clowns? I get it.

315
00:23:58,069 --> 00:23:59,616
Another one of their stupid stunts

316
00:23:59,716 --> 00:24:03,342
...to sell ice cream from that goddamn
truck that hoodlums run around in.

317
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,210
Well, now I really believe this.

318
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,195
You better go now, Dave,

319
00:24:07,295 --> 00:24:08,994
...before the clowns take over, huh?

320
00:24:09,094 --> 00:24:11,229
And when you get back from savin' the world,

321
00:24:11,329 --> 00:24:16,186
...I want a full written report so I can give
it to the chief when he comes back on Monday morning.

322
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,891
Look, everything happened
just the way we said.

323
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:21,626
We are telling you the truth!

324
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:24,386
Alright, alright.
You two come with me.

325
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:25,847
Come on.

326
00:24:25,947 --> 00:24:29,534
Hurry up, Dave.
Don't let 'em get away...

327
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,067
Go ahead, Dave...

328
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,234
Make a dummy out of yourself!

329
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:38,103
But you're not making
a dummy out of me.

330
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,992
You, in the back.

331
00:25:55,505 --> 00:25:57,605
Uh... oh!

332
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:13,331
Uh... excuse me...

333
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,445
Oh, my...

334
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,239
How can I help you?

335
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:26,621
Oh no!

336
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,859
Alright, I'm going up
there and check this out.

337
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:56,448
First I'm taking you home.

338
00:26:56,548 --> 00:27:00,886
No way. I'm going up there with you.
You can't tell me what to do.

339
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:02,420
Debbie, just listen to me, will you?

340
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,456
I don't have to listen to you.

341
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:07,058
You're not my boyfriend any more, alright?

342
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,861
That's true.
I'm not your boyfriend any more.

343
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,230
That doesn't change
the way I feel for you, Debbie

344
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,854
Dave, please.

345
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,233
Don't do this to me.

346
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,570
Alright Debbie, you got a choice.

347
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:22,055
You either go home or I take you back to
the station and lock you up for safety.

348
00:27:22,155 --> 00:27:25,144
How's that?

349
00:27:27,341 --> 00:27:28,601
Pizza.

350
00:27:29,341 --> 00:27:31,021
Oh...

351
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,490
- Pizza.
- Uh-huh.

352
00:27:50,855 --> 00:27:52,604
Oh?

353
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,966
For me?

354
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:00,540
Aww Jim,
is this from you?

355
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:12,683
Look, Debbie...

356
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:15,541
May I please speak to Mike outside?

357
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,620
Right. Sure.

358
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:20,965
Thank you.

359
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:33,581
- Your old boyfriend? This is great.
- You come here?

360
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,816
Probably taking me on top
of the hill and shoot me.

361
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,963
Well, don't worry about Dave.

362
00:28:40,063 --> 00:28:42,793
It's those clowns
who gotta worry about.

363
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:47,341
Listen, as soon as you guys leave here,
I'm gonna follow you up there.

364
00:28:47,441 --> 00:28:51,296
You're gonna follow us up there?
Debbie, I don't even wanna go up there!

365
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,713
Listen, you stay inside the house
and keep the door locked.

366
00:28:53,813 --> 00:28:56,683
I'll be back in a little bit and chipper.

367
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:58,424
Okay?

368
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:01,103
You better.

369
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:12,806
It's good timing.

370
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:20,143
Wait a minute.

371
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:22,679
Where is it?

372
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:26,103
- Yeah, that's what I'd like to know.
- It was right there where that hole is.

373
00:30:26,203 --> 00:30:28,321
So you're saying the
hole is where the tent was?

374
00:30:28,421 --> 00:30:29,360
The tent made that hole?

375
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,244
Yes! It was there.
Look, we saw it. That's a fact.

376
00:30:32,344 --> 00:30:34,079
I tell you what the facts are, mister!

377
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:36,679
You said people are being killed.
Now, where are the bodies?

378
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:40,086
I don't know! I saw Joe Lombardo dead.
I can only tell you what I think I saw.

379
00:30:40,186 --> 00:30:41,718
<i>Oh, so now you just think you saw?</i>

380
00:30:41,818 --> 00:30:44,725
No, I know what I saw! I just can't prove it.
My proof is gone.

381
00:30:44,825 --> 00:30:46,505
Yeah right. Turn around.

382
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,964
Mooney was right, got nothing
better to do but causing problems.

383
00:30:51,064 --> 00:30:54,886
- You'll not gonna get away with it this time.
- Away with what? Debbie saw it too.

384
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:56,454
Yes, she did, didn't she?

385
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,112
- Ow!
- Come on.

386
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,309
- Eddie, is that a new bike you got?
<i>- What's happened, Spike?</i>

387
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:18,959
Wooh!

388
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:22,507
Big Bad Jojo comin' into town.

389
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:26,017
- Watch this, babe.
- Is that bike too big for you?

390
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:27,584
Patty!

391
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,829
- Mean bike you got there.
- Yeah.

392
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,050
Can I take a ride?

393
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:38,595
Pal?

394
00:31:38,916 --> 00:31:41,633
Aww, you can't take a ride...

395
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,257
Can I beep the horn?

396
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:48,834
Oh, thank you!

397
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:58,343
He should've let the man ride his bike.

398
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,700
I'm sorry.

399
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,155
I seem to have broken your bike.

400
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,039
Where did he go?

401
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,250
Badaboo. Badaboo!

402
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:30,408
What are you gonna do,
knock my block off?

403
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,006
Damn!

404
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:37,555
Come on, let's get out of here!

405
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:40,191
- Come on, guys!
- Get out of here!

406
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:52,170
Here is more ketchup
for your french fries.

407
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:56,218
No here is more ketchup. I want
you to sit still and eat your hamburger.

408
00:32:56,318 --> 00:32:58,576
You know, this isn't as
much fun as it used to be.

409
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:01,196
It is if you're the winners.

410
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,343
Back here, young lady.

411
00:34:03,443 --> 00:34:06,338
You're not going anywhere 'till you've finished your food.

412
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,684
What's going on?

413
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:12,959
Alright, get out.

414
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:18,034
Turn around.

415
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,044
What are you doing, man?

416
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:21,623
You're not gonna hit me, are you?

417
00:36:21,723 --> 00:36:23,081
Just turn around, pal.
Alright.

418
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:28,011
- Look, I'm sorry about Debbie, I didn't know...
- Just drop it, Mike!

419
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:32,347
Check this out.

420
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:34,986
That's the stuff!

421
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:38,444
That's the stuff I told you about
that was wrapped all around Lombardo.

422
00:36:38,544 --> 00:36:41,833
- Where did you get that?
- In that jeep over there.

423
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,098
That's McReed's jeep.

424
00:36:43,198 --> 00:36:45,002
- Who's McReed?
- Bob McReed.

425
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:46,938
He was up here
tonight with me and Debbie.

426
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,578
Those are his glasses.

427
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,903
They got him. He's dead.

428
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,573
Crescent Cove Police Station,
Mooney speaking.

429
00:37:07,673 --> 00:37:09,407
<i>I want to report an altercation. </i>

430
00:37:09,507 --> 00:37:11,675
Wait a minute. Calm down,
I can't understand you.

431
00:37:11,775 --> 00:37:13,045
<i> - Clowns!</i>
- What?

432
00:37:13,145 --> 00:37:15,666
<i>are at my front door</i>
<i>and destroying my property!</i>

433
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:19,917
Clowns, huh, and now
they're at your front door.

434
00:37:20,017 --> 00:37:21,652
<i>are at my front door right now!</i>

435
00:37:21,752 --> 00:37:25,392
- Wait. Who is this?
<i>- Could you just come over here?</i>

436
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,674
Stupid kids and their pranks...

437
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:34,774
Rich little bastards.

438
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:37,581
They shoot 'em all.

439
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:42,084
Daddy sends them to fancy schools...

440
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:46,867
...so the police department
can babysit them. Pricks.

441
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,230
Police Station. Mooney speaking. Yup.

442
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,535
Hello, Curt?

443
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:04,273
I think I have a bit of a problem here.

444
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:10,882
Wait a moment.

445
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,992
This is not you too, Mr. Myers.

446
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,178
Police Station. Mooney here.
What?

447
00:38:18,278 --> 00:38:22,767
<i> - took my wife... The clowns... </i>
- They took your wife away in a balloon?

448
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:26,787
Well, you don't need the police.
You need a psychiatrist!

449
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:29,367
Mr. Myers?

450
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:36,423
The Terenzi brothers
and the whole town are in on this?

451
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:40,042
Well, to hell with 'em all.

452
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:46,190
If you want to play games...

453
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,880
...you're messing with the wrong guy.

454
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,635
Jesus! No!

455
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,364
Oh no! Come on, Joe, get going!

456
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:11,637
God!

457
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:25,323
Woaaaah!

458
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,927
Aahh!

459
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:02,764
I'll call the state police up
in Marlborough. They got a lab.

460
00:42:02,864 --> 00:42:05,333
Maybe somebody up there can
tell us what this stuff this.

461
00:42:05,433 --> 00:42:07,758
It is not cotton candy, that's for sure.

462
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:11,148
Yes. Finally.
That's what I've been telling you.

463
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:16,756
Look, I'm sorry I've
been a little tough on you back there.

464
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:18,758
It's been a hard night.

465
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,686
Having Debbie involved
just makes it a lot more difficult.

466
00:42:22,786 --> 00:42:24,421
What can I say? I didn't know...

467
00:42:24,521 --> 00:42:27,741
It has nothing to do with you,
really. It's me.

468
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:31,158
Obviously she goes for laughs,
not stability.

469
00:42:43,164 --> 00:42:44,284
<i> Yoo-hoo. </i>

470
00:42:58,256 --> 00:42:59,756
Ahh! Oh!

471
00:43:02,071 --> 00:43:03,042
Boo!

472
00:43:03,142 --> 00:43:04,239
Oh my God.

473
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:08,728
That's funny.

474
00:43:29,572 --> 00:43:31,602
Oh! Ah!

475
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,564
Just drop me off here.
I'll take the bus home.

476
00:43:40,664 --> 00:43:44,094
No way.
You are the one who has seen these things.

477
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:46,912
Look! A clown! Right there!

478
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:53,380
There he is, I told you.
You get out there and shoot him?

479
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,699
- Get him, Dave!
- Mike, just hang on.

480
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,922
Calm down. Let me check this out.

481
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:16,651
- Holy shit!
- I don't believe it.

482
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:26,334
- Dave, run him down!
- Mike, let go! Mike!

483
00:44:30,579 --> 00:44:32,747
588

484
00:44:32,847 --> 00:44:34,338
What are you doing buddy?

485
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:37,134
Sorry. I freaked out a little bit.

486
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:38,998
Where is he?

487
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:49,142
I don't know.

488
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,170
I don't see him anywhere.

489
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:54,390
He's gone.

490
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:56,758
He went straight up.

491
00:44:58,095 --> 00:44:59,426
I've seen enough.

492
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:03,300
One Baker five.
Curt, do you read me? Over.

493
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,130
One Baker five.
This is Mooney speaking.

494
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,888
I was a little worried about you.

495
00:45:08,988 --> 00:45:12,409
I thought the big bad
clowns got a hold of you. Over.

496
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:14,961
Mooney, I want you to listen to me
and don't say anything.

497
00:45:15,061 --> 00:45:16,727
I want you to call
the state police and get help.

498
00:45:16,827 --> 00:45:20,327
<i>There are clowns
and they are killing people. Over. </i>

499
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:22,265
Okay, let me get this straight.

500
00:45:22,365 --> 00:45:25,367
You say there are clowns
and you've seen them.

501
00:45:25,467 --> 00:45:29,586
Okay, Dave, that's it. Screw you and
your college friends.

502
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,076
I've had enough from you
and from everybody else.

503
00:45:32,176 --> 00:45:36,583
I know what you guys are trying to do:
Break me down, drive me out of the force.

504
00:45:36,683 --> 00:45:39,417
Well, it's gonna take a hell
of a lot more than a lame prank like this...

505
00:45:39,517 --> 00:45:41,820
to get Curtis Mooney to throw in his badge.

506
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,601
So fuck you! Over.

507
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:48,712
- Aww shit!
- Mooney, this is an emergency. Mooney!

508
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:52,164
He cut me off.
That son of a bitch cut me off!

509
00:45:52,264 --> 00:45:53,897
I gotta- I gotta get back to the station.

510
00:45:53,997 --> 00:45:57,905
I don't know what I gotta say,
but I have to get through to state police.

511
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:01,136
- Get the truck!
- And the girls?

512
00:46:01,236 --> 00:46:03,143
Forget about the girls.
They eat too much.

513
00:46:03,243 --> 00:46:06,444
- It is our ice cream!
- So what? The truck's getting away!

514
00:46:06,544 --> 00:46:08,821
Those aren't killer clowns,
those are theTerenzi brothers.

515
00:46:08,921 --> 00:46:09,811
The Terenzi brothers?

516
00:46:09,911 --> 00:46:13,270
Get back to the station, radio for help. I'll
catch up with my friends and warn them.

517
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,884
Alright, tell everyone to stay indoors
and don't do anything stupid.

518
00:46:15,984 --> 00:46:16,962
You too.

519
00:46:24,215 --> 00:46:25,683
<i>- You idiot!</i>
- Oh, shit.

520
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,368
- Don't yell at me. You were driving.
- So now it's my fault?

521
00:46:28,468 --> 00:46:32,704
- This whole ice cream thing was your idea.
- My idea? You said we would have girls this way.

522
00:46:32,804 --> 00:46:33,870
No I didn't. You did.

523
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:35,370
- You did.
- You did.

524
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:40,557
Hey Rich! Paul!

525
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:42,616
Oh man, am I glad to see you guys.

526
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,516
Mike, how're you doin'?
You want some ice cream? We got-

527
00:46:44,616 --> 00:46:47,385
No man, listen. Something horrible's happened.
I need your help.

528
00:46:47,485 --> 00:46:48,888
- What are you talking about?
- What's wrong?

529
00:46:48,988 --> 00:46:53,958
There is no time to explain.
There's clowns goin' around killing people.

530
00:46:53,985 --> 00:46:54,965
Uh-huh.

531
00:46:55,049 --> 00:46:57,762
Tonight, Debbie and I were up
<i>on The Top of the World... </i>

532
00:46:57,862 --> 00:47:00,199
...and we found this spaceship
and we saw these...

533
00:47:00,299 --> 00:47:02,702
clowns and they were carrying these...
cotton candy cocoons...

534
00:47:02,802 --> 00:47:06,123
and they were shooting these..
these... popcorn guns.

535
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:08,292
There is a circus tent-spaceship, right?

536
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:11,829
But it's not there any more but we were
there and we saw the whole thing.

537
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:14,314
And they say we're crazy.
So?

538
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,513
Oh come on, you guys.
I am not foolin' around!

539
00:47:16,613 --> 00:47:19,682
Mike, what do you want us to do?
We have ice cream to sell tonight.

540
00:47:19,782 --> 00:47:21,505
Paul, this is more important
than selling ice cream.

541
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:24,374
There's clowns goin' around killing people.
We're all in danger.

542
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:26,577
Well, we have not sold
much ice cream tonight.

543
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,847
- We haven't sold any.
- Come on, guys, will you help me?

544
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:33,550
At least take me over to Debbie, okay?
I think she is in danger.

545
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,675
Does she have any roommates?

546
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:38,989
Yes, she's got two.
She's got two beautiful roommates.

547
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:40,522
...with big boobs.

548
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:42,267
Do they like ice cream?

549
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:43,415
They love it.

550
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:46,608
What are we waiting for?

551
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:48,457
Come on!

552
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:52,497
Let me through.
Let's get away.

553
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:58,901
Freak yourself

554
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:02,026
You ain't gonna get the best of me.

555
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:12,921
I made it through Korea,
I can make it through this bullshit.

556
00:48:28,921 --> 00:48:31,371
Woop-dee-goddamn-dee-doo!

557
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:34,038
What do we have here?

558
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:47,084
Well son, I think you made a big mistake.

559
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:49,888
You're in Mooney territory now.

560
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:53,485
For me?

561
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:07,803
I ought to shoot you right now,
you red nosed freak.

562
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:10,438
So you wanna play games, eh?

563
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:22,785
Turn around!

564
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:29,929
Alright...

565
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:33,570
I am supposed to read you your rights...

566
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:35,980
...but you're in Mooney's jail...

567
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:39,144
...and you ain't got no rights.

568
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:41,343
Alright, buster.

569
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:43,932
God.

570
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:53,572
Hey Officer Mooney,
c'mon, let us outta here!

571
00:49:53,672 --> 00:49:56,407
- Are we gonna be here all night or what?
- Yeah, we want our phone call.

572
00:49:56,507 --> 00:50:00,077
- Right. I wanna call my...
- Shut up!

573
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:11,704
Get your hands up.

574
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:35,990
Get in there.

575
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,608
I don't know who you are...

576
00:50:57,187 --> 00:50:59,567
...but before this night's over...

577
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:02,747
...you're gonna be begging for mercy.

578
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:21,170
What are you in for?

579
00:51:37,024 --> 00:51:39,194
Siren blaring, then shuts down)

580
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:48,276
Mooney!

Police Department. Hello?

582
00:52:48,258 --> 00:52:52,158
Mooney? Mooney, you back here?

583

God.

Hey Dave...

585
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:36,823
Who was the girl
who I saw you with last night?

586
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:49,009
Do not worry, Dave.

587
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:53,049
All we wanna do is kill you.

588

<i>V.C.P.D., this is</i>

<i>What's all these reports</i>
<i>about circus clowns?</i>

593
00:55:57,921 --> 00:55:59,372
These clowns aren't people.

594
00:55:59,472 --> 00:56:02,459
They are some kind of creature,
things from another planet.

595
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,528
Look Jack, they're killing people.
Officer Mooney is dead.

596

I know. I saw. He was killed
by one of these things.

available units immediately please? Over.

Oh c'mon, forget Hidden Lake.
This has nothing to dowith Hidden Lake.

610
00:57:07,371 --> 00:57:10,837
We would have to be total morons
to believe this clown invasion crap.

611
00:57:10,937 --> 00:57:13,629
If there are killer clowns
runnin' around here,

Okay, see this
white house right over here?

- Right.

- Right.
- No, left!

622

The house's right up.. uh...

C'mon Rich, we're losing it.
Can't you go a little bitfaster?

630
01:01:31,001 --> 01:01:35,131
Come on, Mike, what do you want?
This is an ice cream truck.

631
01:01:47,002 --> 01:01:49,382
Hey Rich, the cops!
Stop the truck!

632
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:51,399
Woah...

633
01:01:53,909 --> 01:01:55,078
Shit, Rich, now you did it.

634
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:57,329
I did it?! What do you mean?
You told me to stop.

635
01:01:57,429 --> 01:01:58,992
Didn't I tell you to pull over?

636
01:01:59,092 --> 01:02:00,661
No you didn't.
You said "stop", so I stopped.

637
01:02:00,761 --> 01:02:01,729
Well, I meant "pull over".

638
01:02:01,829 --> 01:02:03,844
If you meant "pull over"
you should've said "pull over".

639
01:02:03,944 --> 01:02:05,844
Why don't you say
what you mean next time?

640
01:02:05,944 --> 01:02:08,744
Come on, let's see what happened.

641
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:12,690
Dave, are you OK?

642
01:02:14,529 --> 01:02:16,644
God. Oh fuck...

643
01:02:16,744 --> 01:02:18,934
What the hell are you guys doing?

644
01:02:19,034 --> 01:02:20,194
They got Debbie.

645
01:02:21,636 --> 01:02:23,596
Get in the truck now.

646
01:02:25,807 --> 01:02:29,193
Gee, officer, I am really sorry.
I was feelin' a little queasy...

647
01:02:29,293 --> 01:02:30,661
You might wanna tell me
where they're headed.

648
01:02:30,761 --> 01:02:33,563
They went that way, but we're lost.
I don't know where they went.

649
01:02:33,663 --> 01:02:36,230
I do. If you were a clown,
where would you hide?

650
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:37,499
The amusement park!

651
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:39,839
- Great!
- Alright!

652
01:03:12,954 --> 01:03:16,384
The park is closed.
I'll have to ask you to leave.

653
01:03:48,123 --> 01:03:50,997
What are you gonna do
with these pies, boys?

654
01:04:41,505 --> 01:04:42,805
Hey!
Heyheyheyhey!

655
01:04:42,905 --> 01:04:44,655
Everybody stick together.

656
01:04:47,582 --> 01:04:48,671
She's gone.

657
01:04:49,284 --> 01:04:50,284
Wow...

658
01:04:50,484 --> 01:04:52,934
Hey you guys, this is weird.

659
01:04:54,089 --> 01:04:57,993
- Look at this stuff.
- Looks like a wad of melted ice cream.

660
01:04:58,093 --> 01:05:00,683
- Yes, but it's not.
- Oh shit.

661
01:05:01,329 --> 01:05:02,523
Yeah.

662
01:05:03,098 --> 01:05:04,224
Come on.

663
01:05:15,654 --> 01:05:16,854
- Hey.
- Sorry

664
01:05:19,514 --> 01:05:22,142
Mike, you take this. Follow me.

665
01:05:22,283 --> 01:05:26,343
Alright, you guys, no fooling around.
Stick together, okay?

666
01:05:27,355 --> 01:05:29,595
What the hell is in here?

667
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,667
Ooooooo-hooooo. Scary.

668
01:05:41,669 --> 01:05:45,869
- Dave, did you call for help?
- Yes, it's on its way.

669
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,925
You told them this is an invasion?

670
01:05:48,025 --> 01:05:50,793
I told them,
but I don't even believe it myself.

671
01:05:50,893 --> 01:05:55,233
Where did they come from?
Why are they here? Why clowns?

672
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:57,129
They are not clowns.

673
01:05:57,229 --> 01:06:02,190
They are some kind of animals
from another world that look like clowns.

674
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:03,416
Shit, Dave.

675
01:06:03,691 --> 01:06:08,096
Dave, maybe from the ancient astronauts
who came to earth centuries ago...

676
01:06:08,196 --> 01:06:11,416
...and our idea of clowns
just comes from them.

677
01:06:11,533 --> 01:06:13,493
How come they are not funny?

678
01:06:13,535 --> 01:06:15,453
Maybe they're from a dying planet.

679
01:06:15,553 --> 01:06:17,955
Maybe their sun pooped up
and they need a new place to live.

680
01:06:18,055 --> 01:06:22,043
Maybe they need us for experiments,
for dissection and study.

681
01:06:22,143 --> 01:06:24,243
That means they're intelligent

682
01:06:24,779 --> 01:06:26,664
So why don't they communicate with us?

683
01:06:26,764 --> 01:06:29,564
I mean, talk to us
instead of killing us?

684
01:06:29,818 --> 01:06:35,488
Maybe they're just cruisin' through
the galaxy and stopped here for a bite to eat.

685
01:06:38,126 --> 01:06:42,363
Yeah. Look, everybody,
let's just holf off from the talking, okay?

686
01:06:42,463 --> 01:06:44,563
Let's not give ourselves away.

687
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,237
What are we gonna do when we find them?

688
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:48,052
Can we kill them?

689
01:06:48,152 --> 01:06:50,882
Yeah.
You shoot them in the nose.

690
01:07:00,548 --> 01:07:02,158
Hey, watch this.

691
01:07:04,052 --> 01:07:05,341
Cool.

692
01:07:30,215 --> 01:07:31,513
Weeew!

693
01:07:31,613 --> 01:07:33,295
- What happened?
- What did you do?

694
01:07:33,395 --> 01:07:35,183
I didn't do anything...

695
01:07:35,283 --> 01:07:40,183
Well, don't touch anything, okay?
This place is probably booby-trapped.

696
01:07:44,492 --> 01:07:48,008
Alright. Now look you guys, stay together.
I don't wanna run around and find you too.

697
01:07:48,108 --> 01:07:50,465
No problem. We can handle it.

698
01:07:50,565 --> 01:07:52,032
Yeah...

699
01:07:54,074 --> 01:07:55,474
Woah!

700
01:07:59,507 --> 01:08:01,407
Alright, let's go.

701
01:08:02,110 --> 01:08:05,546
Where did they go?
Come on, Rich, Paul.

702
01:08:06,147 --> 01:08:09,484
Don't worry about the Terenzi brothers.
They do this all the time.

703
01:08:09,584 --> 01:08:13,504
Those guys are like cats.
They always land on their feet.

704
01:08:17,901 --> 01:08:19,601
Weew...

705
01:08:33,741 --> 01:08:35,641
Are you Debbie's roommates?

706
01:08:36,344 --> 01:08:37,814
Wait a second.

707
01:08:39,847 --> 01:08:41,542
I recognize this place.

708
01:08:42,817 --> 01:08:46,457
This is the tent where
Debbie and I were in. Come on!

709
01:08:54,462 --> 01:08:55,724
Go Mike.

710
01:09:08,476 --> 01:09:10,678
Okay, this is where we were before.

711
01:09:10,778 --> 01:09:12,847
Wow, this is incredible.

712
01:09:12,947 --> 01:09:14,849
Looks like they got the whole town.

713
01:09:14,949 --> 01:09:18,753
We got to find her.
What kind of balloon was she in?

714
01:09:18,853 --> 01:09:20,320
Uh... yellow.

715
01:09:21,189 --> 01:09:22,656
Alright.

716
01:09:37,305 --> 01:09:39,967
- Do you see anything, Mike?
- I don't.

717
01:09:45,179 --> 01:09:46,840
Impossible, Mike.

718
01:09:58,326 --> 01:10:01,386
Shh. Quiet.
Move back.

719
01:10:34,387 --> 01:10:35,297
Ah...

720
01:11:47,201 --> 01:11:50,087
Paul was right, man. They are hungry.
They're gonna eat everybody!

721
01:11:50,187 --> 01:11:52,123
Calm down! Just calm down, alright?

722
01:11:52,223 --> 01:11:55,903
We gotta find Debbie
before it's too late. Alright.

723
01:11:57,812 --> 01:12:01,315
Hey. That's the one.
The yellow balloon. Is she in there?

724
01:12:01,415 --> 01:12:03,585
- Yes, she's in there!
- Debbie!

725
01:12:03,596 --> 01:12:04,968
- She's alive.
- Thank God.

726
01:12:05,068 --> 01:12:07,855
- How the we get her out of here?
- I don't know.

727
01:12:07,955 --> 01:12:10,480
- Careful, Mike.
- Damnit!

728
01:12:10,591 --> 01:12:13,617
Debbie? Honey?
Hang on a second, Mike. Damn!

729
01:12:14,562 --> 01:12:16,564
- Woah! What are you doing?
- Stand back, Mike

730
01:12:16,664 --> 01:12:19,414
- You can't shoot. You could kill her.
- Let's just back off, alright?

731
01:12:19,514 --> 01:12:21,404
Now, just get ready to run.

732
01:12:24,238 --> 01:12:25,662
Are you alright?

733
01:12:29,162 --> 01:12:31,271
- Are you OK?
- Oh yeah.

734
01:12:32,947 --> 01:12:34,215
I couldn't breathe.

735
01:12:34,315 --> 01:12:36,977
Let's get up. Mike, give me a hand.

736
01:12:37,084 --> 01:12:39,821
- Oh God.
- We better get the hell out of here.

737
01:12:39,921 --> 01:12:42,306
Come on, Debbie. Come on.

738
01:12:42,406 --> 01:12:44,483
Come on.

739
01:12:47,495 --> 01:12:49,797
Wait a second guys. We can't leave.

740
01:12:49,897 --> 01:12:52,625
There might be other people
still alive in these balloons.

741
01:12:54,214 --> 01:12:56,314
Come on, it's too late!

742
01:12:56,393 --> 01:12:57,493
Dave!

743
01:13:02,622 --> 01:13:03,943
Woohoooo!

744
01:13:04,043 --> 01:13:05,043
Graagh!

745
01:13:05,179 --> 01:13:06,168
Shoot 'em!

746
01:13:08,716 --> 01:13:11,247
- Let's go. Come on.
- Coming...

747
01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:32,221
- What now?
- Everybody, down!

748
01:13:32,321 --> 01:13:34,157
- We don't know what's down there.
- Come on, Mike

749
01:13:34,257 --> 01:13:37,547
Nobody is gonna
put me in a balloon again.

750
01:13:38,246 --> 01:13:40,206
Come on, Mike.
Get a move on!

751
01:13:47,888 --> 01:13:49,778
Why did you guys stop here?

752
01:13:51,529 --> 01:13:54,073
- Good reason.
- Okay, which way do we go?

753
01:13:54,173 --> 01:13:56,343
- That doesn't really matter.
- Let's go down here.

754
01:13:56,443 --> 01:13:57,633
Alright, come on.

755
01:14:08,704 --> 01:14:09,704
Weee!

756
01:14:10,804 --> 01:14:13,954
- Come on, let's try it over here.
- No!

757
01:14:21,848 --> 01:14:23,318
Fuck...

758
01:14:23,849 --> 01:14:25,182
Come on.

759
01:14:25,459 --> 01:14:26,926
Careful.

760
01:14:42,677 --> 01:14:44,167
Come on.

761
01:15:00,061 --> 01:15:01,596
Shit! Another door!

762
01:15:01,696 --> 01:15:04,006
I can't take this any more!

763
01:15:06,033 --> 01:15:07,643
Come on, open the door!

764
01:15:08,536 --> 01:15:11,300
- Another door!
- Come on, Mike!

765
01:15:11,605 --> 01:15:13,300
Another door!

766
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:17,905
- Another door!
- Hurry!

767
01:15:22,249 --> 01:15:23,409
Debbie, come on!

768
01:15:27,153 --> 01:15:28,182
Dave, come on!

769
01:15:31,325 --> 01:15:33,285
Close the door, Mike!

770
01:15:33,661 --> 01:15:35,629
- Come on.
- Look. Here!

771
01:15:37,264 --> 01:15:39,854
Come on... Oh God.

772
01:15:40,301 --> 01:15:41,491
We got it.

773
01:15:47,208 --> 01:15:50,473
Look at this place.
Where do we go now?

774
01:15:52,613 --> 01:15:54,363
Alright, let's go.

775
01:16:04,468 --> 01:16:05,469
Oh...

776
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,303
Everyone, up on top.
Come on, let's move!

777
01:16:15,403 --> 01:16:16,392
Come on!

778
01:16:17,405 --> 01:16:18,702
Hurry!

779
01:16:28,567 --> 01:16:30,568
Eww!

780
01:16:44,799 --> 01:16:45,891
Rich, Paul!

781
01:16:46,066 --> 01:16:48,869
<i>Stop! Leave them the hell alone!</i>

782
01:16:48,969 --> 01:16:50,834
<i>Do as I say OR ELSE! Uh... </i>

783
01:16:53,107 --> 01:16:54,335
<i>Gimme the mic!</i>

784
01:16:54,742 --> 01:16:58,041
<i>I am the great and powerful Jojo!</i>

785
01:16:58,446 --> 01:17:00,414
<i>I command you to stop. </i>

786
01:17:00,648 --> 01:17:03,845
<i>Do not hurt them. Let them go. </i>

787
01:17:03,951 --> 01:17:06,784
<i>You will obey me. Let them go. </i>

788
01:17:06,887 --> 01:17:08,777
That's our chance...

789
01:17:14,728 --> 01:17:17,180
Rich! Paul!
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!

790
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:19,216
Come on, let's go!
Get in the truck! Let's go!

791

What the hell is that?

797
01:18:12,686 --> 01:18:15,311
I don't wanna play here any more.
Can we go home now?

798
01:18:17,012 --> 01:18:18,805
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

799
01:18:18,905 --> 01:18:20,406
Everyone out of the truck!
Come on!

800
01:18:20,506 --> 01:18:22,394
We can't! It's rented!

801
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:36,470
Nooo!

802
01:18:48,689 --> 01:18:50,719
Wooaaaaaahhh!

803
01:19:01,835 --> 01:19:04,934

- Mike, Mike! It's too late buddy.

804
01:19:12,546 --> 01:19:15,898
Look, there is a way out now.
Mike, take Debbie and get her out of here.

805
01:19:15,998 --> 01:19:19,633
- I'll draw attention.
- No! Dave, don't! We can all escape!

806
01:19:19,733 --> 01:19:20,699
We can't, Debbie.

807
01:19:20,799 --> 01:19:22,368
- Stop him!
- Dave, let's get out of here!

808
01:19:22,468 --> 01:19:24,948
- What are you doing?
- Go now, Mike!

809
01:19:27,824 --> 01:19:28,717
Dave!

810
01:19:28,817 --> 01:19:32,129
Come on, guys, move! Run for help!

811
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:35,023
Over here!

812
01:19:57,944 --> 01:19:59,624
Come on, you damn clown.

813
01:20:02,029 --> 01:20:03,087
Come on, you!

814
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:10,579
Aaargh!

01:20:18,545 --> 01:20:19,534
Come on!

816
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:21,180
They are taking off!

817
01:21:56,864 --> 01:21:58,065
Dave!

818
01:22:00,981 --> 01:22:02,370
You made it!

819
01:22:03,617 --> 01:22:05,209
You got it, man.

820
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:07,649
Wow! What a ride!
Jee-haw!

821
01:22:08,522 --> 01:22:10,603
That's the last time we let you drive.

822
01:22:10,703 --> 01:22:11,792
You're alive!

823
01:22:11,892 --> 01:22:12,871
Yeah.

824
01:22:12,971 --> 01:22:15,609
But I saw you guys get
blown up in the ice cream truck.

825
01:22:15,709 --> 01:22:18,379
Oh, that. We hid in the freezer
with the ice cream.

826
01:22:18,479 --> 01:22:21,047
- Does anyone want a dipsicle?
- You and your ice cream.

827
01:22:21,147 --> 01:22:23,087
- What?
- How are we gonna pay for the truck?

828
01:22:23,187 --> 01:22:24,919
Don't blame me. It was your idea.

829
01:22:25,019 --> 01:22:27,154
No, it wasn't.
You were the one who said we could get girls.

830
01:22:27,254 --> 01:22:28,514
You said we could.

831
01:22:28,522 --> 01:22:30,961
Hey listen, if it wasn't for me,
you'd be a dead french frie.

832
01:22:31,061 --> 01:22:33,376
Yes, you would be a dead pasta.

833
01:22:42,289 --> 01:22:44,120
Do you think it's over?

834
01:22:45,125 --> 01:22:46,422
Yeah, sure.

835
01:22:47,534 --> 01:22:48,934
Eww!
