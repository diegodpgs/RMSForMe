SHIKENBARU SENTENCED
TO DEATH

3
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,631
He's a karate man from Okinawa.

4
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,311
He challenged a karate school
and killed seven men.

5
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,837
A bloodthirsty thug.

6
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,392
He refuses to talk to
any lawyer or chaplain.

7
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:31,032
Number 1820. Execution at 3:10pm.
Be ready.

8
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,635
No need to be ready.

9
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,276
Alright, you still have some time.

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,710
He is a very prominent priest
from the Buddhist League.

11
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,708
He travels to pray for men like you.

12
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,995
You have a brother and a sister.

13
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,310
You can leave a message, if any.

14
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,999
Get lost.

15
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,469
Alright, leave us alone.

16
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,910
Five minutes.

17
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,358
You're a karate man, eh?

18
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,759
What is your school?

19
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,231
I'm Shikenbaru, the last
genuine Okinawa karate fighter.

20
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,271
Karate nowadays is like a kid's game.

21
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,669
Originally, karate was to kill
or to be killed.

22
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,156
I wish I could live long enough
to fight someone like you.

23
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,039
There is time still.

24
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:57,190
THE STREETFIGHTER

25
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,072
Don't move.

26
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,197
I have given you delayed asphyxia.

27
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,828
What do you mean?

28
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,795
You belong to the Daigyoku School!

29
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,956
I belong to nothing.

30
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,389
You are beginning to go numb.

31
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,714
If you want to live to fight me,

32
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,474
keep hold of yourself
just for another ten minutes.

33
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,718
You can do it.

34
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,109
Come on.

35
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,595
Up on your feet.

- Is it heart failure?
- He has still a feeble pulse.

48
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,756
We can save him.

49
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,476
Warden?

50
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,359
What is your advice, Counsellor?
I've never had such a case.

51
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,677
Suspend the execution
and take him to the hospital.

52
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,751
Code 43.

53
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,556
An ill prisoner shall be
temporarily hospitalised.

54
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,875
Get out of the way.

55
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,275
Hey, it's dangerous.

56
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,029
Move!

57
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,435
Excuse me...

58
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,509
Run!

59
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,399
Come with me.

60
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,836
We made it, partner.

61
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,109
We made it.

62
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,915
Get in.

FUKUOKA 88

TOKYO

65
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,431
The police have not traced...

66
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,636
...the abducted prisoner in Fukuok a.

67
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,990
Despite all the police efforts.

68
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,193
It still remains a mystery
if it w as a calculated crime.

69
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,035
Stupid police.

70
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,589
It happened right on this road.

71
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,957
But the witnesses differ.

72
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,436
Which suggests that
there were plural abductors.

73
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,274
The date of ex ecution w as
not publicised.

74
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,072
Even if the abductors had known it

75
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,513
they couldn't have predicted
the prisoner being hospitalised.

76
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,758
Carbonised chicken for lunch,
partner!

77
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,390
Can't I have a proper food for once?

78
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,034
How dare you complain?

79
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,515
You would have starved without me.

80
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,518
I even wash your underwear for you,
don't I?

81
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,718
The oil tycoon Hammett is dead.

82
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,069
He w as the president of Berunera.

83
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,999
The world's third biggest
oil company.

84
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,431
He w as also pro-Japanese.

85
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,951
This will be an unfathomable loss
for Japan.

86
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,909
His daughter is

87
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,119
the only heiress
to his billion-dollar legacy.

88
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,230
Miss Sarai Hammett is currently

89
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,629
studying in Japan.

90
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,238
Next news...

91
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,717
The mission is completed.

92
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,838
Where is my brother?
Is he alive?

93
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,719
Let us talk to him.

94
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,831
Oh, it's impossible.

95
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,508
How can a runaway prisoner
stay in Japan?

96
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,953
Where is he, then?

97
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,150
On his way to Hong Kong.

98
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,718
Pay me the rest, three million.

99
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,593
Not till I see him.

100
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,239
Please!

101
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,349
Stop!

102
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,632
We have no money.

103
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,638
The advance was all we could raise.

104
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,559
Please give us some more time.

105
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,790
I need some collateral.

106
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,153
You'll sell.

107
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,599
How dare you!

108
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,988
Give me a break.

109
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,031
We had to save our brother.

110
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,230
You make me sick.

111
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:05,118
I hate a man
who doesn't keep his promises.

112
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,268
Is that karate?

113
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,872
Is that not enough?

114
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,071
Give up. You'll never beat me.

115
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,477
Brother!

116
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,759
Brother!

Front block!

120
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,075
Start!

121
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,352
Master, Miss Sarai Hammett is here.

122
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,394
Uncle.

123
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,790
Sarai,

124
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,190
there's a bad news.

125
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,709
Your father died
the day before yesterday.

126
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,275
Oh, no!

127
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,714
He wrote to me
only a few days ago.

128
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,834
Poor Father.

129
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,237
Fly home immediately, Sarai.
I'll arrange the flight.

130
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,113
No, she'd better wait.

131
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,355
Uncle?

132
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,117
Mr Jadot will come
to take you home.

133
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,069
Sarai.

134
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,672
We talked to Mr Jadot over the phone.

135
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,390
Your father had a stroke.

136
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,669
Now listen.

137
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,236
You are his only beneficiary.

138
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,029
You are responsible for the third
largest oil company in the world.

139
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,716
The vultures will
inevitably start to circle.

140
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,951
MUTAGUCHI ENTERPRISES

141
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,749
Tsurugi, you are
the meanest guy I ever met.

142
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,638
Trading, eh?

143
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,195
But don't go too far.

144
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,959
A nice girl, though.

145
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,229
Alright.

146
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,511
Three million yen, as requested.

147
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,356
Stop!

148
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,917
I'll take care of her.

149
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,870
In fact, I've been trying
to reach you.

150
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,069
You kidnapped that prisoner,
didn't you?

151
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,157
Let's talk business.

152
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,675
Sure, let's talk over dinner.

153
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,712
No need for haste.

154
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,277
There are people
I want to introduce to you.

155
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,677
Meet Miss Yang and Mr Liang
from Hong Kong.

156
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,793
Mr Tsurugi.

157
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,674
I've heard quite a bit about you.

158
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,675
The man who makes
the impossible possible.

159
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,357
Skip the flattery.
Let's talk business.

160
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,308
Kidnap her.
Although she is well protected.

161
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,478
By Kendo Masaoka,
the Master of Seibukan.

162
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,628
This is the right job for you,
isn't it?

163
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,398
The fellow karate man.

164
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,029
Five million yen.

165
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,717
50 million. 20 million in advance.

166
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,869
Come on, that's unreasonable.

167
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,634
It's very reasonable.
Especially with Masaoka.

168
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,873
50 million cash on delivery.

169
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,833
No advance.

170
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,795
- We don't trust you that far.
- I see.

171
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,354
I don't trust you, either.

172
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,754
No trust, no business.

173
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,831
Good day.

174
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,515
Wait.

175
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,191
We confided in you.

176
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,629
You can't go just like that.

177
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,717
I see. The Goryu Kai!

178
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,430
The Hong Kong-based
assassination company.

179
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,390
A Mafia subsidiary outfit.

180
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,952
So you belong to them, too,
Mutaguchi.

181
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,588
But don't worry.
There's an evil code of conduct.

182
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,279
I have a very tight mouth.

183
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,112
No, Mutaguchi!

184
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,598
You don't know how dangerous
he can be.

185
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,672
Especially when you are exposed.

186
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,070
But not here. Liang!

187
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,912
You get him.

188
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,552
Faster, partner.

189
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,709
Your legs.

190
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,389
Higher.

191
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,799
Lighter.

192
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,035
Are you alright?

193
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,358
Partner!

194
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,119
I know too much to live, huh?

195
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,235
How dirty the Mafia are.

196
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,839
The Mafia!

197
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,678
It's getting fun.

198
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:20,155
Now I know what I'm going to do.

199
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,599
Tell your boss
that I'm her enemy now.

200
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,469
Liang.

201
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,432
How could you take
that sort of insult from him?

202
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,755
Why didn't you kill Tsurugi?

203
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,078
I tried.
But he was too good for me.

204
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,748
Forgive me.

205
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,313
No, I can't.

206
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,799
The Goryu Kai has never let
its clients down, you know.

207
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,269
Did you come all the way to Japan
to ruin that reputation?

208
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,073
Forgive me.

209
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,632
Suicide or execution.

210
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,197
Mutaguchi.

211
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,109
Tsurugi is our enemy now.

212
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,872
Let's ask the Hong Kong
headquarters for a better assassin.

213
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,193
Wait.

214
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:25,068
Kendo Masaoka is
the best karate man in Japan.

215
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,677
I'm worried.

216
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,915
Who are you?

217
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,758
Who are you?

218
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,678
You're better looking in person.

219
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,073
Let her go. What do you want?

220
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,999
I'm Tsuchida,
assistant to the master.

221
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,192
Bring your boss.

222
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,069
Uncle.

223
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,912
So you are Kendo Masaoka.

224
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,835
I'm Takuma Tsurugi.
I want a bout with you.

225
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,108
I know how inefficient
your karate dojo is.

226
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,912
Let me prove it.

227
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,033
If you refuse...

228
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,999
...I'll kill her.

229
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,512
Follow me.

230
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,075
Are you OK?

231
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,955
How unfair.

232
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,839
I'm Kanzengaku.

233
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,471
I'll get you...

234
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,749
That's it.

235
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,195
Now you fight me, Master Masaoka.

236
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,589
Wait.

237
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,268
Come.

238
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,591
Partner! Partner!

239
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,713
You said your name
was Takuma Tsurugi?

240
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:31,233
I used to know a karate man,
Reizan Tsurugi, in China.

241
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:38,437
He aimed at fusing
Japanese karate and Chinese boxing.

242
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,552
Is he your father by any chance?

243
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,517
Wait, Soldier!

244
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,037
Soldier, please!

245
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,836
Listen to me!

246
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,038
- Shut up!
- Daddy isn't a spy.

247
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,630
Let him go. Please.

248
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,155
Brat!
You are the son of a dirty traitor!

249
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,554
Get lost.

250
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,753
Daddy! Daddy...

251
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,035
Takuma.

252
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,599
Don't trust anybody.

253
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,915
You can only count on yourself.

254
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,197
Train yourself. Body and mind.

255
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,152
Be stronger than anybody else.

256
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,958
Don't let anybody
get the better of you.

257
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,878
That's enough.

258
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,153
Alright, I got your point.

259
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,111
You did? Fine.

260
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,433
Well then, I want you to hire me.

261
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,719
Somebody has hired the Goryu Kai
to work with the Mafia...

262
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,750
...to take over
Miss Hammett's fortune.

263
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,109
Anybody can escort her home.

264
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,435
But your job will be completed

265
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,351
only when you
get rid of the villains, right?

266
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,515
That's right.

267
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,393
I decided that
I was the man for the job.

268
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,279
That's why I'm here.

269
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,235
Sure, we need as many good men
as we can get.

270
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,671
Wait. If this is all for my sake,
forget it.

271
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,150
I'd rather die than
to be protected by this animal.

272
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,431
He makes me sick.

273
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,799
Master Masaoka, what's your decision?

274
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:18,318
I may in fact be worse
than the villains.

275
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,676
But I know the way
they think and act.

276
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,717
There is only one question.

277
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,835
What is it?

278
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,271
I feel some blazing anger
in your karate.

279
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,358
Is it your father's
unfulfilled ambition

280
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,838
which lies deep in your mind?

281
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,791
I hope it is.
Because you've got what it takes.

282
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,350
Bollocks. My father was one man,
I'm another.

283
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,033
What's your answer?
Am I hired or not?

284
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,754
OK. I trust you.

285
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,513
Not only as a fighter, but as a man.

286
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,956
OK. I accept the job.

287
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,191
Hong Kong

288
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,519
Takuma Tsurugi, eh?

289
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,438
A cheap Japanese fighter.

290
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:54,034
How could you, the Goryu Kai,
stand for that?

291
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,788
He seems to be tough.

292
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,193
Even Miss Yang is having
a hard time with him.

293
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,035
Dingsau, I need some of your men,

294
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,508
as usual.

295
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,755
OK.

296
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,710
Just a minute. Mr King...

297
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:18,229
Your client must be big this time.

298
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,032
You'll be paid enough.

299
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,834
I may go to Japan myself.

300
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,999
It's so rare to hear you
do it yourself!

301
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,112
The Tsurugi boy.

302
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,190
I'd like to see him die
with my own eyes.

303
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,831
Hello, boss.

304
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,189
Hello, boss.

305
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,552
- What happened?
- He ran away.

306
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,792
Endoshi, what did you do?

307
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,231
I killed a guy
who spoke ill of the boss.

308
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,274
Moroko, have you seen Endoshi?

309
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,275
Where has he gone?

310
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,712
Hey, you.

311
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,791
Your name and nationality,
Chinese or Japanese?

312
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,273
He's been hanging around
for some time.

313
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,600
His nationality is unknown.

314
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,310
Suspicious. Arrest him.

315
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,515
Stop!

316
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,953
Dingsau,

317
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,718
who is this weirdo?

318
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,475
One of your men?

319
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:43,190
Officer, just leave the man alone,
will you?

320
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,395
Dingsau, recently,

321
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:50,593
you haven't been paying
much respect to the law.

322
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,758
Now look, Officer.

323
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,430
I am the law in Kowloon.

324
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,790
Remember that.

325
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:47,473
A new arrival.
Take any one you like.

326
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,235
Nachi!

327
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,115
Nachi!

328
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,716
Nachi!

329
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,395
Brother...

330
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,356
How in the world...
What happened to you?

331
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,230
So you are alive.

332
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:41,597
Gijun didn't die in vain, after all.

333
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,078
You mean he died?

334
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,352
Takuma Tsurugi killed him.

335
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,149
What?

336
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,079
Brother.

337
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,037
I don't give a damn about myself.

338
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:03,119
But we have a score to settle.

339
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,312
Avenge Gijun for me.

340
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,076
So you are brother and sister.

341
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,156
Also Tsurugi...
How strange fate is.

342
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,270
Let me redeem my sister, boss.

343
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,915
Do you have money?

344
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,551
Give me a job. Any job.

345
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,311
Can you beat Takuma Tsurugi?

346
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,715
If you kill him, she is yours.

347
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,193
Come to Japan with me.

348
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,398
I promise I will.

349
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:06,232
I will surely kill Takuma Tsurugi.

350
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,311
Oh, karate. I know karate very well.

351
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,993
I'm sorry, Sarai,
I couldn't come sooner.

352
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,830
Vice-president Jadot
feels very sorry for you.

353
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,153
I thought he'd come, Mr Bayan.

354
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,677
He is a very busy man, you know.

355
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,030
He will come to see you in Hong Kong.

356
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,073
I know it's sudden, but

357
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,317
we'll fly to Hong Kong tonight.

358
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,274
These two men will accompany her.

359
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,873
Would that be OK?

360
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,836
That isn't necessary.

361
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:21,591
It is Master Masaoka's responsibility
to protect her.

362
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,430
Until she leaves Japan.

363
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,395
Don't worry.

364
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,515
They are her good friends,
both of them.

365
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,478
Goodbye, Uncle.

366
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,312
Please.

367
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,271
Thank you.

368
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:51,117
Partner, are we following her home?

369
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:55,836
Of course.
But protection isn't our only job.

370
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,870
I'm also after her money.

371
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,518
We're going.

372
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,438
Why did he stop?

373
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,469
We can't get out!

374
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,909
We've taken off!

375
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,391
Help!

376
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,556
Rakuda! Hang on!

377
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,639
Are you alright, Rakuda?

378
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,790
I think so.
But they went too far this time.

379
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,716
Shit!

380
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,117
Partner... where are we going?

381
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,872
To the Mutaguchis.

382
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:43,511
Partner, the Mafia is too much
for the two of us.

383
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,999
Coward.

384
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:46,356
Partner, we don't know
what comes next.

385
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,031
- Are you scared?
- I am.

386
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,514
What are you doing?

387
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:58,356
Wait for me in the car.
Keep the engine running.

388
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,629
OK.

389
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,993
Shikenbaru!

390
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,954
What are you doing here?

391
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,557
I've been waiting for you.

392
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,999
I'll kill you this time.

393
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,069
I've got something going on.

394
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,916
I don't have time for you.

395
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,352
Are you afraid?

396
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,112
Tsurugi, I know
who you're looking for.

397
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,230
The girl isn't here.

398
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,873
What?

399
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:16,232
They took her to
Mutaguchi's villa in Izu.

400
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,632
If you want to rescue her,
go over my dead body.

401
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:38,638
No use trying to use her for cover.

402
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:43,719
She isn't afraid to die to kill you,
believe me.

403
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,595
Let's go.

404
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,679
Here we are.

405
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:25,151
We had to make the detour for you
to see somebody.

406
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,832
See him quickly.

407
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:33,240
We have to catch the plane.

408
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,039
We aren't leaving tonight.

409
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,953
What?

410
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,310
So you lied to us.

411
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,229
Sorry, we had our reasons.

412
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:53,197
To be frank, we don't want you
foreigners to be meddling.

413
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,233
Mr Bayan, what are you saying?

414
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:59,876
These gentlemen are my friends.

415
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,428
Oh, yeah?

416
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:08,759
To me they seem to be a part of
a rotten scheme.

417
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:13,397
I don't believe them,
the people of this country.

418
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,999
Mr Bayan!

419
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,795
Kendo Masaoka is no exception.

420
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,958
He's after you for your money.

421
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,479
Damn you!

422
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,708
Let's go, Kan!

423
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,269
A blind man?

424
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,755
Kan! Onaga!

425
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,749
Kan! No!

426
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,439
Onaga!

427
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:01,712
MUTAGUCHI VILLAGE

428
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,351
Get off! No!

429
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,998
Get your hands off me!

430
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:25,516
No! Stop! No!

431
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,515
He frightened me.

432
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:53,035
They are trying to kill you
with me as a decoy.

433
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,554
Bayan is a traitor.

434
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:00,830
Mr Jadot might be dead by now.

435
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:06,639
Oh, Tsurugi, I don't know what to do.

436
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,553
Help me, please.

437
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,757
It'll be OK. You can count on me.

438
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,272
But the odds are against us.

439
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:29,473
Stop acting like a lady
and follow me. Understand?

440
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:36,510
It's OK. I've got you.

441
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:45,193
Partner! Quick!

442
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,269
This way!

443
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,675
Get on the boat!

444
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,348
Wait for me downstream.

445
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:25,269
- Don't let anything happen to her.
- OK.

446
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,798
Takuma Tsurugi!

447
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,633
You are good.

448
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,149
I'm Kowloon Dingsau.

449
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:15,833
Which means
'the cutthroat of Kowloon'.

450
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,836
But I won't use my sword with you.

451
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,434
Everybody stay back.

452
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:19,675
He helped the girl to escape.

453
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:23,316
We must make him tell where she is.

454
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:28,116
Please, we can't afford
to have him killed yet.

455
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,039
Alright.

456
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:37,875
Hands up.

457
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,599
Walk.

458
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,591
What's happened to Tsurugi?

459
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,035
I'm worried.

460
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:07,317
Miss, you stay here.

461
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,672
I'll go take a look.

462
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,673
Talk.

463
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:22,595
Tell us.

464
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:24,749
Where is Sarai?

465
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,228
Damn you...

466
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,478
How can you be so stupid?

467
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:41,229
What's the good of helping
such a baby?

468
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:46,319
You'll gain a lot
from co-operating with us.

469
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:07,272
Why the haste to die
at your age, anyway?

470
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,072
Partner!

471
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,995
That guy took the girl away.

472
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,558
Leave him alone!

473
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:27,668
Put that away.

474
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:30,912
What are you going to do?

475
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,911
Two more bullets.

476
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:40,873
If you want to save him,
tell me where Sarai is.

477
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:43,029
Stop!

478
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,433
Come on.

479
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,353
Please!

480
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:58,711
Kill me instead of him.

481
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,115
Next...

482
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,834
No, no! I'll tell you!

483
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,993
Rakuda, don't!

484
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,148
Partner...

485
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,356
We can't give up our task.

486
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:13,154
We've got to save Sarai!

487
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,431
Partner...

488
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,751
But, even if you say so...

489
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,594
Stop!

490
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,079
I'll talk.

491
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:38,630
She's waiting down the river.

492
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:40,949
Go!

493
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:53,034
Partner...

494
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:55,834
Partner...

495
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,514
Wait!

496
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:06,590
Dingsau, you always
have to get involved.

497
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,355
We can't let him live.

498
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,433
Let me do it.

499
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,671
Partner!

500
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,558
He's alive!

501
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:58,594
Partner! Partner!

502
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:03,879
Can you get up?

503
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:10,836
There are many spas around here,
partner.

504
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:14,271
I'll take you to one. Come on.

505
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,597
Hold on to my shoulder. Come.

506
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:25,874
You go back to Tokyo... alone.

507
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:29,029
What are you saying, all of a sudden?

508
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:37,199
Are you a man or a mouse?

509
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:41,992
I'll never team up with you again.

510
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:45,710
But, remember...

511
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,359
they could have killed you.

512
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,030
Do you think I would die so easily?

513
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:57,357
Why did you disobey me?

514
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:03,709
Please,
I'll never be a coward again.

515
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:09,316
If I'm not your partner any more,
let me be your slave.

516
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:14,552
Ever since you rescued me
in Singapore,

517
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:17,479
I've belonged to you.

518
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,598
Don't leave me.

519
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:28,754
Partner!

520
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,837
Rakuda...

521
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,998
I don't think you are fit
for this kind of job.

522
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:39,636
You'd better save money
and live long.

523
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:49,753
Partner...

524
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:55,870
KOBE

525
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:14,874
Wait!

526
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,672
Try to escape and I'll kill you.

527
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,311
Rakuda...

528
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:50,035
Partner...

529
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:58,318
Don't... give up on me.

530
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,598
Partner...

531
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,518
I...

532
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:11,798
...may be as cowardly as a mouse.

533
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,837
I keep making mistakes.

534
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,599
Forgive me.

535
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,469
Thank you.

536
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:02,875
PRINCESS S ARAI (BERUNERA OIL)

537
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:38,634
Mr Jadot!
How nice to see you safe!

538
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:42,591
Read that.

539
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:52,114
"I, Sarai Hammett,
renounce every right to

540
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:55,118
"Berunera Oil Company and...

541
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:59,954
"...transfer it to Abdul Jadot."

542
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,552
Get the idea, miss?

543
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:05,233
Berunera Oil Company will be

544
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:10,594
owned by Mr Jadot and
the Goryu Kai, Hong Kong.

545
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,831
Sign it, please.

546
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:17,837
The man who had me kidnapped

547
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:19,678
and who killed my friends...

548
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,036
You left one out.

549
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:28,313
The man who also sent
your old man to Heaven...

550
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:29,669
that was me.

551
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,436
Alright, young lady, sign it.

552
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,552
No! Never!

553
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:50,678
Dingsau, Tsurugi is still alive.

554
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,712
He followed me.

555
01:13:56,240 --> 01:14:00,791
Moroko got into a fight with him,
but I'm not sure...

556
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:06,075
Shikenbaru.

557
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:10,592
I was just thinking of
my eventual successor.

558
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:13,555
A strong man like Tsurugi.

559
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:20,433
But if you get him, I'll give you
the Kowloon territory.

560
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,996
Have a good fight.

561
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:53,715
Lady, you'd better sign it.

562
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:56,558
Kill me.

563
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:59,672
If you want my money so badly,
just kill me and take it.

564
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:00,069
- He's here! Tsurugi!
- What?

565
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,028
Tsurugi!

566
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:09,393
- Tsurugi!
- Finally.

567
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:13,755
Tsurugi!

568
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,550
- Wait!
- What now, Dingsau?

569
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:24,478
I have a suggestion.

570
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,156
Tsurugi and Shikenbaru
are old enemies.

571
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:29,752
Let them fight.

572
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,279
We don't have time for it.

573
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:37,232
If he loses,
I'll fight Tsurugi myself.

574
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:42,237
Tsurugi.

575
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:46,676
How about that? OK?

576
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:54,275
OK.
If I win, will you give up Sarai?

577
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:58,110
Yes, I will.

578
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:00,998
Are you ready, Shikenbaru?

579
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:08,309
Tsurugi!

580
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,757
You played dirty!

581
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,873
Nachi!

582
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,476
Brother!

583
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:13,791
Stab us!

584
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:18,672
Together!

585
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:31,911
Tsurugi! Come on!

586
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,636
Tsurugi!

587
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:58,878
THE END
