1
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:48,082
Here's my day, so far.

2
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:52,161
Went to jail, lost the girl of my
dreams and got my butt kicked.

3
00:00:52,169 --> 00:00:53,394
Pretty good.

4
00:00:53,937 --> 00:00:57,014
Still, things could be a lot worse.

5
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:01,905
Oh, that's right, I'm falling
to my death.

6
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,051
Guess they can't.

7
00:01:04,817 --> 00:01:06,673
How did it all come
to this, you ask?

8
00:01:07,912 --> 00:01:09,686
My end starts at the beginning.

9
00:01:10,046 --> 00:01:11,904
The very beginning.

10
00:01:15,563 --> 00:01:17,318
Yes, that's me.

11
00:01:18,055 --> 00:01:20,944
I had a fairly standard childhood.

12
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:24,896
I came from what you might call,
a broken home.

13
00:01:26,226 --> 00:01:28,300
Literally, broken.

14
00:01:28,304 --> 00:01:31,525
I was eight days old and still living

15
00:01:32,162 --> 00:01:33,572
How sad is that?

16
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:36,066
Clearly it was time to move on.

17
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:39,313
Here is your, Minion, he will take care of you.

18
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,075
And here is your binkie.

19
00:01:41,223 --> 00:01:44,290
You are destined for ...

20
00:01:44,295 --> 00:01:46,104
I didn't quite hear that last part.

21
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:47,746
But it sounded important.

22
00:01:47,788 --> 00:01:50,476
Destined for, what?

23
00:01:52,322 --> 00:01:55,261
I set out to find my destiny.

24
00:01:56,746 --> 00:02:00,937
Turns out a kid from the Blaupunkt
quadrant had the exact same idea.

25
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,141
That was the day I met,
Mr. Goody-two-shoes.

26
00:02:14,023 --> 00:02:18,570
And our glorious rivalry,
was born!

27
00:02:23,286 --> 00:02:25,688
Could this be what I was destined for?

28
00:02:26,075 --> 00:02:28,561
A dream life filled with luxury?

29
00:02:30,643 --> 00:02:31,867
Apparently not.

30
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,756
Even fate makes its favorite soup.

31
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:37,721
No big deal.

32
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:41,089
A much different fate awaited me.

33
00:02:49,018 --> 00:02:50,348
A baby.

34
00:02:50,612 --> 00:02:51,981
How thoughtful.

35
00:02:51,988 --> 00:02:55,380
Oh yes, yes. I saw it and thought of you.

36
00:02:55,941 --> 00:02:59,168
Luckily I found a lovely little
place to call home.

37
00:02:59,278 --> 00:03:00,593
Can we keep him?

38
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:04,653
A place that taught me the
differences between right...

39
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,381
...and wrong.

40
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,343
Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes on the other hand,

41
00:03:09,347 --> 00:03:11,918
had life handed to him on a silver platter.

42
00:03:11,922 --> 00:03:13,345
Our baby can fly.

43
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:16,971
- Yes, yes
- And that was not the best

44
00:03:16,978 --> 00:03:21,277
The power of flight, invulnerability, and great hair.

45
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:25,183
But I had something far, far greater,

46
00:03:25,187 --> 00:03:26,815
My amazing intellect.

47
00:03:26,823 --> 00:03:29,992
A knack for building objects of mayhem.

48
00:03:35,743 --> 00:03:39,352
After a few years, and with some time
off for good behavior.

49
00:03:39,977 --> 00:03:43,679
I was given an opportunity to better
myself through learning.

50
00:03:44,155 --> 00:03:47,377
At a strange place called shh-ool.

51
00:03:47,706 --> 00:03:51,783
It was there that I once again ran into
Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes.

52
00:03:51,809 --> 00:03:55,885
He had already amassed a gigantic army of
soft-headed groupies.

53
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:07,326
He bought their affections with showmanship,

54
00:04:09,064 --> 00:04:14,285
So I too would make this 'popped-corn'
and win over those mindless dregs.

55
00:04:14,293 --> 00:04:15,306
Lights out!

56
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,776
That's when I learned a very hard lesson.

57
00:04:35,783 --> 00:04:38,609
Good receives all the praise, adulation.

58
00:04:38,614 --> 00:04:41,633
While evil is sent to quiet time in the corner.

59
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,923
So a fitting end wasn't really an option.

60
00:04:46,616 --> 00:04:49,943
While they were learning the itsy
bitsy spider.

61
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:52,661
I learned how to dehydrate
animate objects.

62
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,630
And rehydrate them at will.

63
00:04:55,985 --> 00:05:00,710
Someday's it felt like it was just me and Minion,

64
00:05:01,612 --> 00:05:03,858
No matter how hard I tried.

65
00:05:03,863 --> 00:05:06,047
I was always the odd man out.

66
00:05:06,051 --> 00:05:07,921
The last one picked.

67
00:05:07,925 --> 00:05:10,454
The screw-up... black sheep.

68
00:05:11,452 --> 00:05:13,707
Bad boy.

69
00:05:21,575 --> 00:05:22,577
Oh!

70
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,735
Was this my destiny?

71
00:05:27,457 --> 00:05:29,782
Wait! Maybe it was.

72
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,597
Being bad is the one thing
I'm good at.

73
00:05:34,408 --> 00:05:35,497
Then it hit me.

74
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,106
If I was the bad boy.

75
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,141
Then I was going to be the baddest
boy of them all.

76
00:05:43,874 --> 00:05:46,875
I was destined to be a super villain.

77
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:49,375
And we were destined to be rivals.

78
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,443
The die had been cast.

79
00:05:52,446 --> 00:05:56,715
And so began an enduring epic,
life long career.

80
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,959
And I loved it.

81
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:03,433
Our battles quickly got more elaborate.

82
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:08,185
He would win some, I would almost
win others.

83
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:10,963
He took the name, Metro Man.

84
00:06:11,517 --> 00:06:13,922
Defender of Montrosity.

85
00:06:13,954 --> 00:06:16,442
I decided to pick up something a
little more humble.

86
00:06:16,447 --> 00:06:18,049
Megamind.

87
00:06:18,053 --> 00:06:23,529
Incredibly handsome criminal genius,
and master of all villainy.

88
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:28,022
MEGAMIND

89
00:06:33,731 --> 00:06:35,941
Read on your own time. Open up.

90
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:43,831
Hey!

91
00:06:44,078 --> 00:06:45,165
BOO!

92
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:50,256
Oh, good morning, Warden.

93
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:52,689
Great news, I'm a changed man.

94
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:56,785
And I'm ready to re-enter society
as a solid citizen.

95
00:06:57,064 --> 00:06:59,672
You're a villain, and you're always
be a villain.

96
00:06:59,676 --> 00:07:00,870
You'll never change.

97
00:07:01,292 --> 00:07:02,580
And you'll never leave.

98
00:07:02,584 --> 00:07:05,516
- You're fun.
- You got a present in the mail.

99
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,524
Is it a puppy?

100
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:12,117
From Metro Man. To count every second
of your 85 life sentences.

101
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:15,168
That's funny, never thought Metro Man
was the gloating type.

102
00:07:15,177 --> 00:07:17,072
Oh but he does have nice taste.

103
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,586
I think I'll keep it.

104
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:20,796
Any chance you could give me the time?

105
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:23,924
I don't want to be late for the opening
of the Metro Man museum.

106
00:07:24,507 --> 00:07:27,762
Oh no, looks like you're

107
00:07:27,973 --> 00:07:29,866
By several thousand years.

108
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:34,188
Oh, am I?

109
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:40,534
Happy Metro Man day, Metro City.

110
00:07:43,141 --> 00:07:48,466
It's a beautiful day downtown where
we're here to honor a beautiful man.

111
00:07:48,474 --> 00:07:50,296
Metro Man.

112
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,529
His heart is an ocean that's inside
a bigger ocean.

113
00:07:54,535 --> 00:07:58,167
For years he's been watching us

114
00:07:58,182 --> 00:08:02,613
Saving us with his super strength,
and caring for us with his super heart.

115
00:08:02,614 --> 00:08:05,651
Now it's our turn to give something back.

116
00:08:05,656 --> 00:08:10,462
This is Roxanne Ritchi reporting live, from
the dedication of the Metro Man Museum.

117
00:08:10,471 --> 00:08:12,861
Wow, okay, the stuff they make
you read on the air.

118
00:08:12,862 --> 00:08:15,158
That's unfreaking believable, it's crazy.

119
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:17,910
I wrote that piece myself, Hal.

120
00:08:17,913 --> 00:08:19,900
What I was trying to say was,

121
00:08:19,904 --> 00:08:24,815
I can't believe that in our modern society
they let like actual art get onto the news.

122
00:08:24,816 --> 00:08:28,830
- Nice save, Hal.
- What are we, like lets just get

123
00:08:28,831 --> 00:08:31,510
Come on, it's time to get in the
Metro Man day spirit.

124
00:08:31,524 --> 00:08:35,133
Well, if I were Metro Man Megamind
wouldn't be kidnapping you all the time.

125
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,121
That's the first thing.

126
00:08:36,123 --> 00:08:37,910
That's sweet of you.

127
00:08:37,914 --> 00:08:41,555
And I'd be watching you, like
a dingo watches a human baby.

128
00:08:41,565 --> 00:08:43,873
- Mmm.
- Okay, that sounded, Okay that

129
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,254
A little bit, yeah.

130
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:47,219
And you're making your face,
and that's making me feel weird.

131
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,235
Not love, we're not in love.
I'm not saying I love you.

132
00:08:53,238 --> 00:08:55,949
Okay, I love you, whatever.
I'm not saying I'm in love with you.

133
00:08:55,953 --> 00:09:00,040
I'm saying... Roxanne?
Roxaroo?

134
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:16,170
Get back to work.

135
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:17,957
The city doesn't pay you to loaf.

136
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,248
- Freeze!
- Whoa, what are you doing, guys?

137
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:21,625
It's ME!

138
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,097
Hey, open up.

139
00:09:31,606 --> 00:09:34,202
Oh, you fools. He's tricked us.

140
00:09:34,438 --> 00:09:35,609
You were right.

141
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,868
I'll always be a villain.

142
00:09:44,006 --> 00:09:47,841
<i>Bad to the bone.
Bad to the bone.</i>

143
00:09:47,842 --> 00:09:52,745
<i>B..B..B..Bad.
B..B..B..Bad.</i>

144
00:09:52,749 --> 00:09:56,281
<i>Bad to the bone.</i>

145
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:59,273
Well hello good looking, need a lift?

146
00:09:59,282 --> 00:10:02,165
Certainly do, you fantastic fish you.

147
00:10:02,215 --> 00:10:03,673
Get in the car, you.

148
00:10:07,325 --> 00:10:09,561
Thanks for sending me the watch, Minion.

149
00:10:09,565 --> 00:10:10,569
You got it, boss.

150
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:15,731
All right, put your hands in the air.

151
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,740
Ladies and gentlemen, your Metro Man.

152
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:27,818
And... Metro Men.

153
00:10:28,317 --> 00:10:30,323
Hey, Metro City!

154
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:35,671
Give me some, come on give it now.
Give it to me. What?

155
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,573
Give it to me... all right!

156
00:10:40,991 --> 00:10:43,242
Yo, hey, ha, ha yo.

157
00:10:55,253 --> 00:10:56,786
Hey, Metro city.

158
00:10:58,189 --> 00:10:59,533
Hello, hey.

159
00:11:00,912 --> 00:11:04,049
You know, you actually want to bring it down a bit.

160
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,515
Boys, a little lower.

161
00:11:05,516 --> 00:11:06,751
Thank you fellows.

162
00:11:06,752 --> 00:11:08,396
Let's get real for a moment.

163
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:11,698
That's right, that's right
ha, ha, that's right.

164
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:14,862
Although getting a whole museum is super cool.

165
00:11:14,863 --> 00:11:19,356
Super cool, you want to know what the
greatest honor you've given me is?

166
00:11:19,357 --> 00:11:20,664
Do you really want to know?

167
00:11:21,142 --> 00:11:23,645
Really?

168
00:11:23,658 --> 00:11:24,638
Then I'll tell you.

169
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,602
The greatest honor you've given me is...

170
00:11:27,606 --> 00:11:29,144
...letting me serve you.

171
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,271
To help these people of Metro city.

172
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:32,779
And at the end of every day.

173
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,240
Well.

174
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,116
I often ask myself.

175
00:11:37,344 --> 00:11:40,028
Who would I be, without you?

176
00:11:40,035 --> 00:11:41,238
I love you Metro Man!

177
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,115
And I love you, random citizen.

178
00:11:50,897 --> 00:11:55,178
I tell you Minion, there's no
place like evil lair.

179
00:11:55,184 --> 00:11:58,596
I kept it cold and damp, just for you, sir.

180
00:12:00,057 --> 00:12:02,079
How do I look, Minion?

181
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,253
- Do I look bad?
- Disgustingly horrifying, sir.

182
00:12:04,254 --> 00:12:06,281
You always know what to say.

183
00:12:06,282 --> 00:12:08,581
All the brain-bots certainly missed you, sir.

184
00:12:08,587 --> 00:12:10,806
Did you miss your daddy?
Whose the menacing little brains?

185
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:14,250
You are, yes you are. Uh, uh!
No biting, no, no, no.

186
00:12:14,255 --> 00:12:18,223
- No, no, no. You want the wrench?
Go get the wrench.

187
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:20,992
Now, back to work.

188
00:12:31,037 --> 00:12:33,458
She's awake,
Quick, to work.

189
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:47,590
- Miss Ritchi, we meet again.
- Would it kill you to wash the bag?

190
00:12:47,598 --> 00:12:51,854
You can scream all you wish, Miss Ritchi.
I'm afraid no one can hear you.

191
00:12:53,426 --> 00:12:55,350
Wha..why isn't she screaming?

192
00:12:55,356 --> 00:12:57,763
Miss Ritchi, if you don't mind.

193
00:12:57,767 --> 00:12:59,260
Like this... AHHHHH!

194
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,232
That's, that's a poor ladies scream.

195
00:13:01,236 --> 00:13:03,885
AHHHHH!

196
00:13:06,965 --> 00:13:09,632
Is there some kind of nerdy super villain website,

197
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:12,644
where you get Tesla coils, and blinky dials?

198
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:15,277
Actually most of it comes from an
outlet store in...

199
00:13:15,282 --> 00:13:16,519
Don't answer that.

200
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,914
...Romania.

201
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:22,064
Don't! Stop! She's using her nosey
reporter skills,

202
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:25,826
on your weak little mind to find
out all our secrets.

203
00:13:27,212 --> 00:13:31,843
Such tricks... won't work...
on me.

204
00:13:31,849 --> 00:13:33,793
- Please talk slower
- Temptress.

205
00:13:33,797 --> 00:13:36,981
What secrets? You're so predictable.

206
00:13:36,987 --> 00:13:39,072
Predictable, predictable?

207
00:13:39,075 --> 00:13:42,654
Oh, you call THIS predictable?

208
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:44,813
Your Alligators, yes.

209
00:13:45,806 --> 00:13:47,581
I was thinking about it on the way over.

210
00:13:48,405 --> 00:13:50,279
What's this? BOOM!

211
00:13:50,311 --> 00:13:52,877
- In your face.
- Cliché.

212
00:13:52,882 --> 00:13:54,236
No, look, watch.

213
00:13:54,922 --> 00:13:55,924
Juvenile.

214
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:57,843
- Shuck it all!
- Tacky

215
00:13:57,847 --> 00:13:59,971
- Oh, so sorry.
- Seen it.

216
00:13:59,975 --> 00:14:01,953
- What's this one do?
- Garish.

217
00:14:02,873 --> 00:14:04,824
Okay, the spiders new.

218
00:14:05,315 --> 00:14:06,317
Spider?

219
00:14:09,972 --> 00:14:11,117
Ee, Uh, yes!

220
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,258
The *spee..ider*. Even the smallest bite
from arachnis deathicus

221
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:19,242
Will instantly paralyze... OW!

222
00:14:19,243 --> 00:14:20,718
Get it off!

223
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,509
- Ow!
- Forget it Megamind. Your plans never work.

224
00:14:25,951 --> 00:14:29,240
Let's stop wasting time and call your
boyfriend in tights, shall we?

225
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:32,245
OOOWWW!

226
00:14:32,248 --> 00:14:36,842
It is a great pleasure that I present to
Metro Man, this new museum.

227
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,562
If you please.

228
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:48,388
Hey! Uh, my kid can't see.

229
00:15:10,801 --> 00:15:15,538
- Megamind.
- Oh, bravo Metro Man.

230
00:15:17,454 --> 00:15:18,486
Booooo!

231
00:15:18,874 --> 00:15:20,567
Yes, I can play along too.

232
00:15:20,568 --> 00:15:21,564
Booooo.

233
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,206
Should have known you'd try
to crash the party.

234
00:15:24,211 --> 00:15:26,563
Oh, I intend to do more than crash it.

235
00:15:26,568 --> 00:15:32,187
This is the day you and Montrosity,
shall not soon forget.

236
00:15:32,195 --> 00:15:35,053
It's pronounced Metro City!

237
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:37,731
Oh, potato, tomato,
potato, tomato.

238
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:39,048
We all know how this ends.

239
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:40,728
With you behind bars.

240
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:44,888
Oh, I'm shaking in my custom
baby seal-leather boots.

241
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:47,318
You will leave, Montrosity.

242
00:15:47,324 --> 00:15:49,428
Or this will be the last
you ever hear of,

243
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:51,721
Roxanne Ritchi!

244
00:15:51,731 --> 00:15:53,689
- Huh?
- Roxanne!

245
00:15:53,696 --> 00:15:57,164
- Don't panic Roxie, I'm on my way.
- I'm not panicking.

246
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:01,288
In order to stop me, You need to
find me first, Metro Man.

247
00:16:01,595 --> 00:16:03,065
We're at the Metroman observatory.

248
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:05,197
Ah ha, no we're not!

249
00:16:05,201 --> 00:16:07,413
Don't listen to her, she's crazy.

250
00:16:28,496 --> 00:16:30,439
Metro Man approaching, sir.

251
00:16:30,533 --> 00:16:32,175
- HAH!
- Hah, hah!

252
00:16:32,178 --> 00:16:33,416
Hah, hah, hah.

253
00:16:49,723 --> 00:16:51,237
Hold on a second.

254
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,315
Oh, good heavens.

255
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:04,801
You didn't think you were at the real
observatory, did you?

256
00:17:10,341 --> 00:17:12,248
Ready the death ray, Minion.

257
00:17:12,249 --> 00:17:13,897
Death ray, readying.

258
00:17:17,768 --> 00:17:19,309
Over here, old friend.

259
00:17:19,313 --> 00:17:20,582
In case you haven't noticed,

260
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,074
You've fallen right into my trap.

261
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:26,036
You can't trap justice.
It's an idea, a belief.

262
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:29,629
Even the most heartfelt belief,
can be corroded with time.

263
00:17:29,635 --> 00:17:31,418
Justice is a noncorrosive metal.

264
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:34,033
But metals can be melted by the
heat of 're-vange'.

265
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:36,163
It's 'revenge' and it's best
served cold.

266
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:39,228
But it can be easily reheated, in the
microwave of evil.

267
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:40,622
Well I think your warranty is about
to expire.

268
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:42,351
Maybe I got an extended warranty?

269
00:17:42,356 --> 00:17:45,286
Warranties are invalid if you don't use
the product for it's intended purpose.

270
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,521
Oh, girls, girls, you're both pretty.
Can I go home now?

271
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:54,974
Of course, that is if Metro Man, can withstand
the full concentrated power of the... SUN!

272
00:17:55,635 --> 00:17:56,939
FIRE!

273
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:08,404
Minion, fire...

274
00:18:08,407 --> 00:18:10,601
Uh, it's still warming up, sir.

275
00:18:10,605 --> 00:18:12,047
- Come again?
- Warming up, sir.

276
00:18:12,051 --> 00:18:14,878
Warming up?
The sun is warming up?

277
00:18:14,882 --> 00:18:17,414
One... sssecond... more.

278
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:19,731
Aaannnd.... jussst.

279
00:18:19,735 --> 00:18:23,894
Tippy, tappy tippy tap, tap,
tip top more.

280
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,626
And we are ready, in just.

281
00:18:26,631 --> 00:18:29,128
Oh! I told you to have things running.

282
00:18:29,133 --> 00:18:31,069
Told you out of the sounds.

283
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,406
Why do you always blame me?

284
00:18:32,407 --> 00:18:34,887
My spider bite is acting.

285
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:37,354
Your plan is failing,
just admit it.

286
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,689
Yeah, good luck with that one.

287
00:18:38,692 --> 00:18:40,437
Whose side are you on?

288
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,564
The losing side.

289
00:18:41,566 --> 00:18:44,719
- Thank you.
- Uh, could someone stamp my

290
00:18:47,198 --> 00:18:51,295
You of all people, know that we
discontinued that promotion.

291
00:18:51,302 --> 00:18:53,661
- Ta, ta all.
- Same time next week?

292
00:18:58,392 --> 00:19:00,002
What did he just say?

293
00:19:00,012 --> 00:19:01,570
Crab nuggets?

294
00:19:06,237 --> 00:19:08,501
Good lord, I'm trapped.

295
00:19:08,505 --> 00:19:10,264
What kind of trickery is this?

296
00:19:10,271 --> 00:19:15,554
You mad genius.
Your dark gift has finally paid off.

297
00:19:15,562 --> 00:19:16,832
It, it has?

298
00:19:16,834 --> 00:19:21,010
This dome is obviously lined with copper.

299
00:19:21,011 --> 00:19:23,043
- Yeah, so?
- Sir!

300
00:19:23,057 --> 00:19:25,976
Copper drains my powers.

301
00:19:25,981 --> 00:19:28,206
Your weakness is copper?

302
00:19:28,207 --> 00:19:29,903
You're kidding, right?

303
00:19:55,593 --> 00:19:58,833
I don't think even he could
survive that.

304
00:19:59,373 --> 00:20:03,077
Well, lets not get our hopes up
just yet.

305
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:05,427
- Look!
- Metro Man.

306
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:07,975
Metro Man...

307
00:20:07,983 --> 00:20:09,768
Metro Man! AHHH!

308
00:20:17,704 --> 00:20:20,123
Oh god! Oh my god, oh!

309
00:20:21,727 --> 00:20:23,287
Ewwww.

310
00:20:26,022 --> 00:20:27,822
You did it, sir.

311
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:29,041
I did it?

312
00:20:32,324 --> 00:20:33,784
He did it.

313
00:20:34,396 --> 00:20:35,400
I did it.

314
00:20:35,403 --> 00:20:36,920
He did it.

315
00:20:36,922 --> 00:20:38,933
- You did it, sir.
- I did it!

316
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:40,274
- You did it.
- I did it!

317
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:43,267
Montrocity is mine!

318
00:20:46,575 --> 00:20:49,604
You did it sir, you did it, sir.
Yes you did.

319
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:51,094
All right people, hit it.

320
00:20:58,985 --> 00:21:00,138
Hit it!

321
00:21:19,141 --> 00:21:22,963
<i>Living easy, living free.</i>

322
00:21:22,964 --> 00:21:26,856
<i>Season ticket on a one way ride.</i>

323
00:21:26,857 --> 00:21:31,665
<i>Don't need reason, don’t need rhyme</i>

324
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:35,295
<i>- Ain't got nothing I'd rather do.
- Drop 'em.</i>

325
00:21:35,296 --> 00:21:44,080
<i>Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too,</i>

326
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:48,062
<i>I'm on the Highway to...</i>

327
00:21:49,663 --> 00:21:55,210
- Highway..
- La, la, la, la, la...

328
00:21:55,211 --> 00:21:57,635
- Highway..
- Ahh, ahh, ahh....

329
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,011
First off, what a turnout.

330
00:22:04,015 --> 00:22:06,218
How wild is this, huh?

331
00:22:07,897 --> 00:22:12,017
All I did was eliminate the most
powerful man in the universe.

332
00:22:12,024 --> 00:22:13,421
Are there any questions?

333
00:22:13,423 --> 00:22:16,052
Come on..yes?
You in the back.

334
00:22:16,056 --> 00:22:19,595
I'm sure we'd all like to know what you plan
to do with us.

335
00:22:19,601 --> 00:22:21,167
And the city.

336
00:22:21,171 --> 00:22:23,027
Good, I'm glad you asked that one.

337
00:22:23,031 --> 00:22:29,190
Imagine, the most horrible, terrifying
evil thing you could possibly think of.

338
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:33,270
And multiply it by... SIX!

339
00:22:34,466 --> 00:22:40,614
In the mean time I want you to carry on,

340
00:22:40,624 --> 00:22:42,395
Normal people do.

341
00:22:42,398 --> 00:22:44,626
Let's just have fun with this, come on.

342
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,221
And I will get back to you.

343
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:54,755
Now slam the door, really hard.

344
00:22:54,804 --> 00:22:57,813
They can... they can still see you.

345
00:22:57,819 --> 00:22:59,340
- Now?
- Yeah, you're still there.

346
00:22:59,342 --> 00:23:00,991
- Oh,
- Let's get going.

347
00:23:04,032 --> 00:23:08,489
<i>There he is, Mr. Evil Overlord.</i>

348
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,696
Ahh, Minion.

349
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,681
Did you think this day would ever come?

350
00:23:11,685 --> 00:23:16,849
No way, not at all, sir. Never,
never in a million, not even...

351
00:23:16,856 --> 00:23:18,535
Yes, I did.

352
00:23:18,538 --> 00:23:20,399
Look at the intricate moon links.

353
00:23:20,407 --> 00:23:22,737
I'm looking, I'm looking.

354
00:23:22,741 --> 00:23:24,456
And what's this?

355
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:28,253
Looks like one of the giant monitors, in the lair.

356
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:30,499
But it seems to only carry one station.

357
00:23:31,105 --> 00:23:34,354
Oh, that sir is called a window.

358
00:23:34,364 --> 00:23:37,270
- Window...
- All the kids are looking through them.

359
00:23:37,276 --> 00:23:40,853
Oooo, I've never had a view before.

360
00:23:41,224 --> 00:23:44,486
Montrosity Minion, it's all mine.

361
00:23:44,492 --> 00:23:47,800
If my parents could see me now.

362
00:23:47,831 --> 00:23:52,069
Sir, I'm sure they're smiling down
from evil heaven.

363
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:55,800
Well now that Mr. Goody-two-shoes is out
of the way.

364
00:23:55,806 --> 00:23:58,886
I can have, everything I want!

365
00:23:58,898 --> 00:24:01,539
And there's no one to stop me.

366
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:06,210
All aboard! Ha, ha, haaaa...

367
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:11,275
<i>Mental wounds healing,
Driving me insane.</i>

368
00:24:11,276 --> 00:24:16,163
<i>I'm going off the rails,
on a crazy train.</i>

369
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:23,298
<i>I'm going off the rails,
on a crazy train.</i>

370
00:24:24,173 --> 00:24:29,328
<i>We may as well go home, as I did on my own.</i>

371
00:24:29,329 --> 00:24:33,753
<i>Alone again, naturally.</i>

372
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,399
<i>To think that only yesterday.</i>

373
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,301
<i>I was cheerful bright and gay.</i>

374
00:24:40,302 --> 00:24:44,218
<i>Looking forward to, but who wouldn't do,
the role I was about...</i>

375
00:24:44,219 --> 00:24:50,612
I know, I know.
Always thirsty, never satisfied.

376
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:54,100
I understand you,
little well dressed bird.

377
00:24:54,109 --> 00:25:02,643
Purposeless, emptiness, it's a vacuum isn't
it. What's your vacuum like?

378
00:25:02,656 --> 00:25:06,565
<i>Going off the rails, on a crazy train, sir.</i>

379
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:09,292
Hey, hey, hey!
Not now, Minion.

380
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:16,582
I'm in a heated existential discussion
with this dead-eyed plastic desk toy.

381
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:22,161
I... is something wrong, sir?

382
00:25:23,191 --> 00:25:25,127
Just think about it.

383
00:25:25,905 --> 00:25:27,247
We have it all.

384
00:25:28,006 --> 00:25:30,032
But we have nothing.

385
00:25:31,195 --> 00:25:33,524
It's just to easy now.

386
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:36,528
I'm sorry, you've lost me, sir.

387
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:43,240
- I mean, we did it, right?
- Well, you did it, sir.

388
00:25:43,248 --> 00:25:45,605
Yes you've made that perfectly clear.

389
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:50,603
- Then why do I feel so, Mel-on-cholly?
- Huh?

390
00:25:50,611 --> 00:25:53,017
Unhappy.

391
00:25:53,018 --> 00:26:00,332
Oh, uh well, uh. What if tomorrow,
we could go kidnap Roxanne Ritchi.

392
00:26:00,344 --> 00:26:02,129
That always seems to lift your spirits.

393
00:26:04,014 --> 00:26:08,750
Good idea, Minion. But without him,
what's the point?

394
00:26:09,387 --> 00:26:11,979
- Him, sir?
- Nothing.

395
00:26:12,854 --> 00:26:16,022
Okay, um, all right well just uh, that’s uh,

396
00:26:16,027 --> 00:26:17,792
something to consider and um,

397
00:26:17,801 --> 00:26:20,949
well, I think I'll just power
down for a while then.

398
00:26:27,997 --> 00:26:29,882
He was always there for us.

399
00:26:30,193 --> 00:26:32,042
Dependable.

400
00:26:34,008 --> 00:26:35,464
Perhaps we took him for granted.

401
00:26:35,465 --> 00:26:39,913
Maybe we never really know how good we
have it, until it's gone.

402
00:26:41,556 --> 00:26:43,155
We miss you, Metro Man.

403
00:26:43,158 --> 00:26:45,323
I, miss you.

404
00:26:45,345 --> 00:26:48,793
And I have just one question for,
Megamind.

405
00:26:48,801 --> 00:26:50,743
Are you happy now?

406
00:26:53,769 --> 00:26:57,033
This is Roxanne Ritchi reporting from a
city without a hero.

407
00:26:57,075 --> 00:27:02,765
Coming up next. Are you ready to be a
slave army? What you need to know.

408
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:13,325
Aaannd wrap that up and give it
to a child on Christmas.

409
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:16,437
- 'Cause we're done.
- Okay, see you tomorrow, Hal.

410
00:27:16,442 --> 00:27:19,798
Wait, Roxie. I'm having a party
at my house.

411
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:21,968
Coming off the hook, or whatever.
You should come over.

412
00:27:21,971 --> 00:27:26,001
I got a DJ rented a bouncy house.
Made a gallon of dip. It's gonna be sick.

413
00:27:26,008 --> 00:27:30,352
Oh, I don't know, Hal. I don't really
fell like being around a bunch of people.

414
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,441
No, no, no. That's why it'll just
be, like you and me.

415
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:38,173
Wow, that uh, that's certainly very tempting.

416
00:27:38,179 --> 00:27:39,993
- But,
- I did hire a wedding photographer.

417
00:27:39,996 --> 00:27:42,907
That's just in case, we were like
something crazy happened.

418
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:45,757
And you'd want a picture of it. Like maybe
we should have this for like ever,

419
00:27:45,762 --> 00:27:47,213
like a memory, you know.

420
00:27:47,215 --> 00:27:49,185
Um, I'm gonna pass.

421
00:27:49,186 --> 00:27:52,310
I have some work here I need
to do. Okay, bye.

422
00:27:52,315 --> 00:27:54,584
So Thursday? Soft, Thursday?

423
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:56,753
- Goodnight, Hal.
- It's a soft yes, on Thursday.

424
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:00,124
What's, wrong with me?

425
00:28:00,126 --> 00:28:04,593
Rented a bouncy house? She's don't like
bouncy houses, they like clown's.

426
00:28:04,594 --> 00:28:06,519
OW! Ohhh!

427
00:28:07,232 --> 00:28:10,731
Stupid van!
Broken finger!

428
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,071
I've made a horrible mistake.

429
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,666
I didn't mean to destroy you.

430
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:54,301
I mean, I meant to destroy you.

431
00:28:54,302 --> 00:28:56,515
But I didn't think it would really work.

432
00:28:56,516 --> 00:29:00,984
What are we suppose to do,
without you?

433
00:29:00,985 --> 00:29:04,426
I am so tired of running rampant
through the streets.

434
00:29:05,449 --> 00:29:08,915
What's the point of being bad when
there's no good to try and stop you?

435
00:29:09,862 --> 00:29:11,461
Someone has to stop, Megamind.

436
00:29:11,462 --> 00:29:12,742
Hey, we're closing soon.

437
00:29:12,745 --> 00:29:13,951
Oh, you scared me.

438
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:15,754
- Barry, right?
- Bernard.

439
00:29:15,757 --> 00:29:20,163
Bernard, I was just well I was
talking to myself.

440
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,917
You may think I'm a little bit nuts.

441
00:29:21,922 --> 00:29:24,152
I'm not allowed to self guess directly.

442
00:29:24,153 --> 00:29:24,992
Thank you, I just...

443
00:29:24,994 --> 00:29:26,745
Bernard, I'll just be another minute.

444
00:29:28,463 --> 00:29:30,329
- Okay.
- Thanks.

445
00:29:30,448 --> 00:29:34,037
I have so many evil plans in the works.

446
00:29:34,396 --> 00:29:36,036
The illiteracy beam.

447
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,214
Typhoon cheese.

448
00:29:38,217 --> 00:29:39,865
Robo sheep.

449
00:29:40,577 --> 00:29:42,907
Battles we will now, never have.

450
00:29:46,102 --> 00:29:48,426
You know we never had the chance
to say goodbye.

451
00:29:48,843 --> 00:29:51,787
So, it's good that we have this time now.

452
00:29:51,893 --> 00:29:54,446
You know, before I destroy the place.

453
00:29:54,451 --> 00:29:57,859
Nothing personal, it just brings back
to many painful memories.

454
00:30:02,043 --> 00:30:03,914
Hello, hello?

455
00:30:03,918 --> 00:30:04,950
Roxanne!

456
00:30:14,154 --> 00:30:16,713
That's a pretty tasteless costume.

457
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:21,437
- Costume?
- Megamind's head is not that grossly big.

458
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:26,227
Oh you even made a cheap replica of
his dehydration gun. How...

459
00:30:27,437 --> 00:30:29,158
Hello, is someone there?

460
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:34,217
Hello, who's there?

461
00:30:34,818 --> 00:30:37,288
Whoa! Hey, hey. Whew.

462
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:38,408
It's just you, Bernard.

463
00:30:38,411 --> 00:30:41,161
Oh, yes it's just me.
Bernard.

464
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:43,588
Well thank you for letting me stay.

465
00:30:45,533 --> 00:30:46,760
And thirty seven seconds if I were you.

466
00:30:46,765 --> 00:30:48,686
We're having the walls and ceiling removed.

467
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:51,160
Wow, that sounds like. Quite the renovation.

468
00:30:51,164 --> 00:30:53,980
I guess I'll. Guess I'll ride down
with you then.

469
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,919
I kept thinking he was going to do
one of his last minute escapes.

470
00:31:04,834 --> 00:31:07,772
Yeah, he was really good at those.

471
00:31:07,803 --> 00:31:10,536
Oh, if only the world had a reset button.

472
00:31:11,051 --> 00:31:13,397
I've looked into the reset button.

473
00:31:14,446 --> 00:31:16,315
The size is impossible.

474
00:31:17,628 --> 00:31:22,754
Bernard, I didn't know you had... feelings.
Are you okay?

475
00:31:23,888 --> 00:31:28,668
Metro Man is gone. And now there's
no one left to challenge Megamind.

476
00:31:28,675 --> 00:31:30,388
Oh, come on, Bernard.

477
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:33,916
As long as there's evil good will
rise up against it.

478
00:31:33,922 --> 00:31:35,152
Ohhh, I wish.

479
00:31:35,155 --> 00:31:38,072
I believe someone is going to stand
up to Megamind.

480
00:31:38,076 --> 00:31:39,417
- You really think so?
- Yeah.

481
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,907
I mean, it's like they say.
Heroes aren't born, they're made.

482
00:31:45,552 --> 00:31:48,984
Hero’s can be made. That's it!

483
00:31:49,512 --> 00:31:52,173
- All you need are the right ingredients.
- Yeah.

484
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:53,816
- Bravery.
- Yes.

485
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:55,116
- Strength.
- Of course.

486
00:31:55,118 --> 00:31:56,925
- Determination.
- Imperative.

487
00:31:56,929 --> 00:31:58,883
And a smidgen of DNA.

488
00:31:58,892 --> 00:32:02,302
- With that, anyone can be a hero.
- Yeah!

489
00:32:02,303 --> 00:32:03,968
Oh, ho, ho, ho!

490
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:05,511
I think we should run.

491
00:32:06,243 --> 00:32:07,247
Bye.

492
00:32:08,432 --> 00:32:10,591
Time to put the past behind us.

493
00:32:11,989 --> 00:32:13,971
Only the future... AHH!

494
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:17,289
Oh, that's to much.
I'm definitely scared right now.

495
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:19,724
Oh, hope no ones seeing this.

496
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:23,579
Create a hero? A what?
Why would you do that?

497
00:32:23,586 --> 00:32:25,292
So I have someone to fight.

498
00:32:25,295 --> 00:32:28,037
Minion, I'm a villain without a hero.

499
00:32:28,044 --> 00:32:30,068
A ying, with no yang.

500
00:32:30,071 --> 00:32:32,481
A bull fighter with no bull to fight.

501
00:32:32,487 --> 00:32:35,129
In other words, I have no purpose.

502
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:37,830
Now, ask me how I'm going to do it.

503
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:38,979
Go on, ask.

504
00:32:38,984 --> 00:32:40,482
How are you doing to do it?

505
00:32:42,433 --> 00:32:44,978
I'm going to give someone, I don't know
who yet.

506
00:32:44,982 --> 00:32:50,602
Metro Man's powers. I'm going to train that
someone to become Montrocity's new hero.

507
00:32:50,666 --> 00:32:52,330
Over here, follow.

508
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:57,558
And then, finally I'm going to fight that hero.
In an epic battle of good and evil.

509
00:32:57,566 --> 00:33:00,488
We could put everything back the way it was.

510
00:33:00,493 --> 00:33:02,938
When the world was perfect.

511
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,373
And rosy. Behold, Minion.

512
00:33:05,391 --> 00:33:07,494
Metro Man's cape.

513
00:33:07,495 --> 00:33:08,507
Look closely.

514
00:33:08,515 --> 00:33:10,153
Tell me what you see?

515
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:11,167
Dandruff?

516
00:33:11,341 --> 00:33:13,903
Yes, it's his DNA.

517
00:33:13,912 --> 00:33:18,850
From this, we'll extract the source of
Metro Man's awesome power.

518
00:33:21,423 --> 00:33:23,828
Boss, I think this is a bad idea.

519
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:28,994
Yes, It's a very wickedly bad idea.
For the greater good of man.

520
00:33:29,002 --> 00:33:31,667
But I'm saying this is a kind of
bad, bad.

521
00:33:31,671 --> 00:33:34,599
Okay, you might think it's good
in your bad perception.

522
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,047
But from a good perception,
it is just plain bad.

523
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:40,390
Oh, you don't know what's good for bad.

524
00:33:41,329 --> 00:33:43,854
Now we have just one shot at this.

525
00:33:43,862 --> 00:33:46,096
I must find a suitable subject.

526
00:33:46,103 --> 00:33:53,022
Someone who will do harm to mine.
Who puts the welfare of others above their own.

527
00:33:53,514 --> 00:33:57,118
What on earth is that?

528
00:33:57,138 --> 00:34:00,286
Seems to be emanating from there, sir.

529
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:05,681
- O-llo,
- Uh, it's hello.

530
00:34:05,686 --> 00:34:07,378
Hello, like that?

531
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:09,688
- Bernard, it's Roxanne.
- It's Roxanne.

532
00:34:09,693 --> 00:34:12,098
I just want to thank you for
inspiring me the other day.

533
00:34:12,101 --> 00:34:14,437
- Oh, You've inspired me too.
- Great!

534
00:34:14,438 --> 00:34:18,257
It's time we stood up to Megamind
and show him he can't push us around.

535
00:34:18,263 --> 00:34:20,878
Oh, oh really.
She's so cute.

536
00:34:20,882 --> 00:34:22,851
- I'm already hot on his trail.
- Uh, huh.

537
00:34:22,855 --> 00:34:25,029
And what gives you that idea?

538
00:34:25,033 --> 00:34:27,456
- Uh, sir.
- I just found his secret hideout.

539
00:34:27,461 --> 00:34:28,972
How did she find my hideout?

540
00:34:28,974 --> 00:34:32,199
Uh, how did you find his hideout?

541
00:34:32,205 --> 00:34:36,864
This is the only building in Metro City
with a big observatory on the roof.

542
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,503
Okay, there's no way she'll find
the secret entrance.

543
00:34:42,509 --> 00:34:45,141
Oh! There's a doormat here that
say's 'Secret Entrance'.

544
00:34:47,069 --> 00:34:49,214
- Minion!
- I kept forgetting where it was.

545
00:34:49,218 --> 00:34:50,818
She'll discover all our secrets.

546
00:34:50,823 --> 00:34:54,013
- Ohh, oh no!
- You dim-witted creation of science.

547
00:34:54,018 --> 00:34:56,003
What? Oh, not you Roxanne.

548
00:34:56,007 --> 00:34:58,338
No, I was just yelling at my mothers, urn.

549
00:34:58,343 --> 00:35:00,110
Don't do anything, I'll be right there.

550
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,113
Roxanne?

551
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,285
Oh no, not again.

552
00:35:10,499 --> 00:35:11,869
Roxanne.

553
00:35:11,872 --> 00:35:14,251
- Whoa!
- Oh, I'm glad you're here.

554
00:35:14,254 --> 00:35:15,962
How did you get here so fast?

555
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:20,010
Well, I uh. I happened to be speed walking
nearby when you called.

556
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:21,261
- In a suit?
- Uh huh.

557
00:35:21,264 --> 00:35:23,592
It's called, 'Formal Speed walking'.

558
00:35:23,596 --> 00:35:25,091
But that's not important.

559
00:35:25,093 --> 00:35:26,215
I better take the lead.

560
00:35:26,218 --> 00:35:27,357
This way looks exciting.

561
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,602
No, it says, exit.

562
00:35:28,606 --> 00:35:32,105
Uh, which is the abbreviation
for 'Exciting', right?

563
00:35:32,137 --> 00:35:33,742
It's the mother load.

564
00:35:34,046 --> 00:35:35,250
- Ahh.
- Wow.

565
00:35:35,253 --> 00:35:37,428
- Wow.
- Just look at this thing.

566
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:40,360
You know, I really could use your help in
deciphering all this.

567
00:35:40,366 --> 00:35:43,180
- Really?
- You're an expert in all things Megamind, right?

568
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:47,954
- Yes, right.
- Together we could figure out his plan

569
00:35:47,963 --> 00:35:49,247
Are you in?

570
00:35:49,249 --> 00:35:52,272
- Oh, what fun!
- That's what I want to hear.

571
00:35:52,352 --> 00:35:54,611
Minion,
Code-Send out the brain pods.

572
00:35:54,616 --> 00:35:57,112
You know the whole point of a code is...

573
00:35:57,116 --> 00:35:58,776
Oh code-just do it, Minion.

574
00:36:01,381 --> 00:36:03,368
Ahh, it's me you fools!

575
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,479
Bernard!

576
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:08,102
It's daddy.

577
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,173
Megamind!

578
00:36:12,176 --> 00:36:13,982
What have you done with, Bernard?

579
00:36:13,985 --> 00:36:17,302
Bernard? Oh yes, I mean poor defenseless,

580
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:20,255
I don't want to get into it but,
Lasers, spikes.

581
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,625
Oh, please no, not the lasers and the spikes!

582
00:36:23,631 --> 00:36:24,458
You know the drill.

583
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,943
Oh no, not the drill.

584
00:36:26,944 --> 00:36:28,800
- Let him go.
- Or what?

585
00:36:28,804 --> 00:36:31,490
Or I'm going to find out what this
weird looking gun does.

586
00:36:31,495 --> 00:36:34,087
No don't!
Don't shoot that gun.

587
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:35,708
I'll just go get him.

588
00:36:35,754 --> 00:36:37,659
Unhand me you fiend!

589
00:36:37,763 --> 00:36:40,475
It, it's strength's to much.

590
00:36:40,484 --> 00:36:42,678
Oh, I work out.

591
00:36:42,682 --> 00:36:48,111
Argh, it's really paying off.
You're so fit, and strangely charismatic.

592
00:36:51,722 --> 00:36:52,726
Are you okay?

593
00:36:52,729 --> 00:36:55,812
I've did my best.
But he's to fantastic.

594
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:58,078
Here, let me carry that heavy gun for you.

595
00:36:58,082 --> 00:36:59,143
I got this covered.

596
00:37:01,864 --> 00:37:03,732
Let go, it's mine!

597
00:37:03,737 --> 00:37:04,963
Bernard, help!

598
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:08,693
Give it to me.

599
00:37:09,025 --> 00:37:10,028
Oh no!

600
00:37:16,002 --> 00:37:17,026
Roxanne.

601
00:37:18,767 --> 00:37:19,769
Ow!

602
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:24,586
Who on earth is that?

603
00:37:34,776 --> 00:37:35,780
Roxanne!

604
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,781
Bernard, you were right about that door
being exciting.

605
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:41,545
This way.

606
00:37:46,324 --> 00:37:48,059
- Huh!
- What are you doing?

607
00:37:48,063 --> 00:37:50,407
This will stop them, here!

608
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:52,401
Seems a bit extreme, doesn't it.

609
00:37:54,009 --> 00:37:55,012
Just throw it.

610
00:37:55,626 --> 00:37:56,629
Daddy's, suffering.

611
00:38:07,449 --> 00:38:10,234
- Wow, that was real exciting.
- Yeah.

612
00:38:10,238 --> 00:38:12,216
- You were very strong in there.
- I know.

613
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,973
I've never seen anyone but Metro Man
stand up to him like that.

614
00:38:14,981 --> 00:38:16,203
What's going on?

615
00:38:16,206 --> 00:38:17,705
Hal, what happened?

616
00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:19,272
I think a bee flew up my nose.

617
00:38:19,275 --> 00:38:22,133
I was just about to make my frontal
assault to rescue you,

618
00:38:22,137 --> 00:38:24,433
when like fifty ninjas tried to attack me.

619
00:38:24,437 --> 00:38:26,647
So I had to beat them all up, and I did...

620
00:38:26,651 --> 00:38:28,647
- and they were all like crying, so.
- Wow.

621
00:38:28,652 --> 00:38:29,772
Brave one, isn't he.

622
00:38:29,778 --> 00:38:31,119
Who are you?

623
00:38:31,122 --> 00:38:33,016
Oh thi..., this is Bernard.

624
00:38:33,017 --> 00:38:34,466
- He's my partner.
- Partner?

625
00:38:34,469 --> 00:38:36,448
Yes, yes partner.

626
00:38:36,452 --> 00:38:38,779
Well look partner, I'm her partner.

627
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:42,085
She doesn't know what she's saying. She's
been through a traumatic experience.

628
00:38:42,091 --> 00:38:44,492
I'd better take him home.
Thanks again, Bernard.

629
00:38:51,693 --> 00:38:53,588
I'll call you tomorrow, partner.

630
00:38:54,785 --> 00:38:55,787
Yeah, okay.

631
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,079
I'd like that.

632
00:38:57,081 --> 00:39:00,202
That was weird for everybody. 'Cause you
accidentally, okay lets end the meeting.

633
00:39:02,035 --> 00:39:03,068
Sir!

634
00:39:03,069 --> 00:39:05,005
Code-Did you find out
who it was?

635
00:39:05,013 --> 00:39:07,741
Huh?
Oh, oh.

636
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:10,132
Code-get the car.

637
00:39:10,137 --> 00:39:11,396
Code-right away, sir.

638
00:39:19,964 --> 00:39:21,983
- Buh bye.
- See you tomorrow, Hal.

639
00:39:21,988 --> 00:39:23,847
I'll leave the door unlocked in case
you want to check on me later.

640
00:39:26,049 --> 00:39:30,401
Who is this man,
infused with godlike power?

641
00:39:30,402 --> 00:39:33,226
Ow, ow, whoa ho.

642
00:39:33,227 --> 00:39:36,883
Well sir, his name's Hal Stewart.
He's twenty eight years old.

643
00:39:36,889 --> 00:39:38,234
No criminal record.

644
00:39:38,237 --> 00:39:39,705
Actually, no records at all.

645
00:39:39,706 --> 00:39:42,094
Apparently, this man hasn't accomplished anything.

646
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,053
Not yet, Minion.
Not...

647
00:39:44,057 --> 00:39:45,734
...Yet.

648
00:39:45,752 --> 00:39:48,697
Could this day get anymore, funtastic?

649
00:39:48,704 --> 00:39:50,825
So I will just go ahead and defuse him,

650
00:39:50,828 --> 00:39:54,244
since this is clearly a mistake.

651
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,963
No, Minion. Something much
more powerful is at work.

652
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,011
This is no mistake.

653
00:39:59,019 --> 00:40:00,735
It's destiny.

654
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:06,175
Hal Stewart, prepare for your destiny.

655
00:40:06,176 --> 00:40:09,869
Hal? Hal Stewart?

656
00:40:09,873 --> 00:40:11,956
Am I saying it right?

657
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:13,589
Stewart.

658
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,623
Is this a robbery? 'Cause the lady across
the hall has way better stuff than me.

659
00:40:17,629 --> 00:40:19,776
Oh, look. It's Hal Stewart.

660
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,959
Quick, the spray.

661
00:40:22,373 --> 00:40:25,093
- Oops, all out.
- Well use the forget-me-stick.

662
00:40:25,098 --> 00:40:26,121
Oh, right!

663
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,053
Just look at him.

664
00:40:31,464 --> 00:40:35,120
Well, he doesn't look quite the
hero type to me.

665
00:40:35,121 --> 00:40:36,503
Oh, you're such a pill, Minion.

666
00:40:36,505 --> 00:40:40,832
The power couldn't ask for a finer claim.

667
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:42,240
I smell hero.

668
00:40:42,243 --> 00:40:44,475
I smell something burning.

669
00:40:44,479 --> 00:40:45,633
I think it's working!

670
00:40:45,906 --> 00:40:48,889
Places, places...

671
00:40:49,632 --> 00:40:51,173
You have your disguise?

672
00:40:57,806 --> 00:40:58,810
What?

673
00:40:58,813 --> 00:41:00,591
Ah, you look fantastic.

674
00:41:10,106 --> 00:41:12,523
Rise, my glorious creation.

675
00:41:12,528 --> 00:41:15,877
Rise, and come to Papa.

676
00:41:15,982 --> 00:41:17,360
What's going on?

677
00:41:17,363 --> 00:41:20,246
- Easy my child.
- Who are you?

678
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:23,461
I sent you to this planet to
teach you about justice.

679
00:41:23,467 --> 00:41:25,859
Honor, and nobility.

680
00:41:25,871 --> 00:41:28,028
I am your father.

681
00:41:28,793 --> 00:41:31,303
So you're like, my space Dad?

682
00:41:31,872 --> 00:41:34,658
Yeah, I'm like your space Dad.

683
00:41:35,274 --> 00:41:37,396
And you are, what?

684
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,580
I'm your space, Step-Mom.

685
00:41:41,587 --> 00:41:43,469
I, I had some work done recently.

686
00:41:43,476 --> 00:41:45,424
Is this some kind of dream?

687
00:41:45,429 --> 00:41:47,604
This is a dream come true.

688
00:41:47,609 --> 00:41:50,895
You've been blethed
with unfathomamble power.

689
00:41:50,901 --> 00:41:51,973
What kind of power?

690
00:41:51,975 --> 00:41:53,141
Unfathamomble.

691
00:41:53,147 --> 00:41:55,718
It's un, without Fathom.

692
00:41:55,727 --> 00:41:59,255
- Whoa
- Yeah, we've come to guide you.

693
00:41:59,261 --> 00:42:02,752
On your path to be Montrosity's new hero.

694
00:42:02,767 --> 00:42:06,940
And battle the super genius, of Megamind.

695
00:42:10,183 --> 00:42:12,305
I know this is a lot to take in.

696
00:42:12,306 --> 00:42:14,844
It may take months for you
to come to grips..

697
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:16,083
No frickin' way.

698
00:42:20,322 --> 00:42:23,508
Wahoo! Look at the big hero.

699
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:26,176
I'm a big hero.

700
00:42:26,281 --> 00:42:29,628
Thee Minion, he's perfect.

701
00:42:31,142 --> 00:42:33,136
Aaannd, action!

702
00:42:33,137 --> 00:42:35,643
- Someone help me.
- I'm okay.

703
00:42:35,644 --> 00:42:39,311
<i>Sun is shinning in the sky</i>

704
00:42:39,312 --> 00:42:40,443
Ohhh, oh!

705
00:42:40,444 --> 00:42:43,047
<i>There ain't a cloud in sight</i>

706
00:42:43,048 --> 00:42:44,979
Zap, zap, zap.

707
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,678
Ha, haaa!

708
00:42:47,949 --> 00:42:52,775
The flames of my evil burn bright.
Now you thay something cool back at me.

709
00:42:52,783 --> 00:42:55,541
Look, it doesn't even hurt.
Don't even feel it.

710
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:59,350
No, no, no. Shut it down, and stop.

711
00:42:59,356 --> 00:43:00,952
I said slow down.

712
00:43:06,163 --> 00:43:08,996
He's hopeless. HOPELESS!

713
00:43:09,005 --> 00:43:11,692
- Maybe we should change tactics?
- You think so?

714
00:43:11,696 --> 00:43:15,010
Oh, you know how boys are.
They want video games.

715
00:43:15,015 --> 00:43:17,183
I can throw a few parts together.

716
00:43:17,188 --> 00:43:20,795
Can't... wait.
LoL, smiley face.

717
00:43:20,801 --> 00:43:22,305
Can't wait for what, sir?

718
00:43:23,232 --> 00:43:25,435
Oh, that was such a funny story.

719
00:43:25,444 --> 00:43:28,252
And brilliantly told, by the way.

720
00:43:28,253 --> 00:43:30,276
Okay, now you tell one.

721
00:43:30,281 --> 00:43:32,587
Bernard, I never knew you were so funny.

722
00:43:32,595 --> 00:43:35,285
And, I never heard you laugh before.

723
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:36,822
Yeah, it's been a while.

724
00:43:37,526 --> 00:43:38,742
Feels pretty good.

725
00:43:38,743 --> 00:43:43,509
<i>Mr. Blue, you did it right.</i>

726
00:43:43,675 --> 00:43:45,285
And, exit.

727
00:43:47,603 --> 00:43:49,609
<i>Now his hand is on your shoulder</i>

728
00:43:49,618 --> 00:43:50,942
<i>Never mind</i>

729
00:43:50,943 --> 00:43:55,329
<i>I'll remember you this,</i>

730
00:43:55,329 --> 00:43:57,304
<i>I'll remember you this way.</i>

731
00:43:57,305 --> 00:43:58,817
You don't get out much, do you?

732
00:43:58,819 --> 00:44:01,895
Fun!

733
00:44:01,899 --> 00:44:03,924
I used to come here with my mother
when I was a kid.

734
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,592
It was one of my favorite things to do.

735
00:44:06,747 --> 00:44:08,608
Now look at it.

736
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:10,119
It's a dump.

737
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:13,154
<i>Hey Mr. Blue,
we're so please to be with you.</i>

738
00:44:15,261 --> 00:44:16,697
Why are we cleaning up the City, sir?

739
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:22,173
Um, well we don't want to battle our
new hero in a dump, now... do we?

740
00:44:25,846 --> 00:44:27,470
They're all back.

741
00:44:27,473 --> 00:44:29,205
But how, why?

742
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:31,408
Maybe Megamind isn't so bad after all.

743
00:44:36,805 --> 00:44:41,216
That's it. Be free, my beautiful dove.

744
00:44:41,217 --> 00:44:43,815
Wa haoooo

745
00:44:45,593 --> 00:44:51,261
Okay, okay, Metro Man and I,
were never a couple.

746
00:44:51,269 --> 00:44:52,667
But I thought you two were...

747
00:44:52,669 --> 00:44:56,065
I know, everybody did. It's just,
well he was never really my type.

748
00:44:56,072 --> 00:44:57,319
Really?

749
00:44:57,435 --> 00:44:59,908
Okay, now you tell me something.

750
00:44:59,912 --> 00:45:02,774
Something you've never told anyone.

751
00:45:03,527 --> 00:45:07,411
Well, in shh-school.

752
00:45:08,263 --> 00:45:10,984
None of the other kids really liked me.

753
00:45:12,225 --> 00:45:14,505
I was always last one picked
for everything.

754
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,716
Hmm, it's to bad that we didn't
go to the same school.

755
00:45:23,938 --> 00:45:27,146
Hal, I think you're ready for this.

756
00:45:29,267 --> 00:45:31,088
Do I have a son?

757
00:45:31,089 --> 00:45:33,834
No, Hal, you make me laugh.

758
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,996
It stretches, it's for you.

759
00:45:37,363 --> 00:45:39,181
Hey, what's the 'T' stand for?

760
00:45:39,184 --> 00:45:40,347
Titan.

761
00:45:40,351 --> 00:45:42,889
Tighten? What's that suppose to mean?

762
00:45:42,901 --> 00:45:45,397
It was the only name I
could trademark.

763
00:45:45,887 --> 00:45:46,889
Oh.

764
00:45:46,893 --> 00:45:50,513
Do you have someone special
in your life, Hal?

765
00:45:50,523 --> 00:45:52,752
No not yet, but.

766
00:45:52,756 --> 00:45:57,356
There's this really, really good looking one
I've got my eye on, currently.

767
00:46:01,219 --> 00:46:05,821
That's very good. Romance is
very inspiring.

768
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:09,994
- That's what I hear.
- All you have to do, is save her.

769
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:11,828
And she'll be yours.

770
00:46:11,831 --> 00:46:13,651
- Who want's Churro's?
- I do!

771
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:17,337
Thanks spaced out, momma.

772
00:46:17,346 --> 00:46:19,765
On the count of three,
unsheathe your Churro.

773
00:46:19,769 --> 00:46:22,725
One, two, three!
To Titan.

774
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,646
Tomorrow,
you will fight Megamind.

775
00:46:25,647 --> 00:46:28,236
And the city will know your name.

776
00:46:30,236 --> 00:46:32,839
The City's parks' restored to their
original glory.

777
00:46:32,843 --> 00:46:35,099
The street's, the safest they've been.

778
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,507
The banks reopened.

779
00:46:36,511 --> 00:46:38,765
Has something happened to Megamind?

780
00:46:38,769 --> 00:46:41,488
Has someone tamed this monster?

781
00:46:41,493 --> 00:46:47,054
This is Roxanne Ritchi cautiously optimistic,
but pleasantly confused.

782
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:49,572
Well you seem in a very good
mood tonight, sir.

783
00:46:49,577 --> 00:46:51,745
Huh, how long is this going to take me?

784
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:56,430
Just a few alterations, sir. And I'll be
done with your most terrifying cape yet.

785
00:46:56,431 --> 00:47:01,238
I'm calling it, Black
Mambaaaaaaa... aaaa... aaa.

786
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:06,123
Black Mamba, perfect. Ooo, gosh I am
running late. I have to go.

787
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:08,291
What, where, where are you going, sir?

788
00:47:08,295 --> 00:47:10,719
We have our date to battle Titan in the morning.

789
00:47:10,724 --> 00:47:13,186
We haven't even tested your
big battle suit yet.

790
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:14,517
You attend to the details, Minion.

791
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,845
I have to, run a quick errand.

792
00:47:16,849 --> 00:47:18,738
You don't run errands.

793
00:47:18,742 --> 00:47:20,259
What's going on here?

794
00:47:20,261 --> 00:47:22,500
- What?
- Oh, wait a minute.

795
00:47:23,355 --> 00:47:27,131
Are you wearing Jean-Paul Gaultier's,
Fleur Du?

796
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:28,596
It's just my natural musk.

797
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,500
Now, where are the car keys?

798
00:47:30,501 --> 00:47:31,293
Ahhh.

799
00:47:31,589 --> 00:47:34,366
Uh, uh, uh, uh.
This is about Ms. Ritchi, isn't it.

800
00:47:34,371 --> 00:47:36,131
Your going on a date with her.

801
00:47:36,134 --> 00:47:40,842
No my main man, get out of town.

802
00:47:40,851 --> 00:47:44,325
Oh this is bad, this is bad.
You've fallen in love with her.

803
00:47:44,331 --> 00:47:46,735
You are forgetting your place, Minion.

804
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:48,370
Now give me the keys.

805
00:47:49,471 --> 00:47:53,182
What happens when Roxanne finds
out who you really are?

806
00:47:53,188 --> 00:47:54,962
She will never find out.

807
00:47:54,966 --> 00:47:57,021
That's the point of lying.

808
00:47:57,022 --> 00:47:58,947
Ahhh!

809
00:47:58,948 --> 00:48:03,309
Honestly, If I didn't know any better I'd think
this is your first day at being evil.

810
00:48:03,316 --> 00:48:04,567
NO!

811
00:48:05,536 --> 00:48:07,655
This has gone far enough.

812
00:48:08,738 --> 00:48:11,182
Oh, that was really grown up.

813
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:15,526
Sir please, it's for your own good.

814
00:48:15,707 --> 00:48:17,062
Well what do you know.

815
00:48:17,066 --> 00:48:19,248
I may not know much, but I do know this.

816
00:48:19,253 --> 00:48:22,411
The bad guy doesn't get the girl.

817
00:48:22,416 --> 00:48:25,182
Maybe I don't want to be the bad
guy anymore.

818
00:48:28,908 --> 00:48:30,433
You heard me.

819
00:48:30,436 --> 00:48:32,477
Who are you?

820
00:48:33,069 --> 00:48:36,057
- Now give me the keys.
- NO!

821
00:48:36,358 --> 00:48:39,349
My soul purpose in life is
to look after you.

822
00:48:39,355 --> 00:48:41,370
Well I don't need you to look after me.

823
00:48:41,373 --> 00:48:43,604
What are you... what are you saying?

824
00:48:43,608 --> 00:48:46,425
- You don't need me?
- Let me make it clear.

825
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:48,759
Code-I don't need you.

826
00:48:48,764 --> 00:48:50,571
You know what, you know what.

827
00:48:53,413 --> 00:48:56,218
Code-I'll just pack my things and go.

828
00:48:56,223 --> 00:48:57,390
Code-Fine!

829
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:58,827
Code-Fine back.

830
00:49:01,889 --> 00:49:04,116
Well good luck on your date.

831
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,928
- I will.
- That doesn't even make any sense.

832
00:49:06,934 --> 00:49:08,328
I know.

833
00:49:39,628 --> 00:49:42,229
I know I am so close, I can feel it.

834
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:48,495
Okay, okay I just have to take
a step back.

835
00:49:54,764 --> 00:49:56,770
Wait a minute.

836
00:50:08,828 --> 00:50:10,092
Titan.

837
00:50:10,093 --> 00:50:12,153
What's a Titan?

838
00:50:12,157 --> 00:50:15,172
My super ears are burning.

839
00:50:16,774 --> 00:50:19,950
I usually just hear criminals. You
haven't been naughty, have you?

840
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:23,205
I'm totally messing with you. I'm totally messing
with you.

841
00:50:23,209 --> 00:50:24,462
The names Titan.

842
00:50:24,467 --> 00:50:28,676
- Titan?
- Your very own heroic guardian

843
00:50:28,683 --> 00:50:30,769
What's your name? Just kidding, I know
everything about you.

844
00:50:30,774 --> 00:50:33,842
Oh, oh! And I brought some flowers,

845
00:50:33,847 --> 00:50:37,541
Didn't know what you liked, so I
just grabbed you know, all of them.

846
00:50:37,548 --> 00:50:42,145
Okay, you don't like flowers.
Okay, uh, uh, forget the flowers.

847
00:50:42,146 --> 00:50:45,582
- What do you want?
- Thought maybe we could go for a little

848
00:50:45,588 --> 00:50:47,012
- Get to know each other first.
- WHOA!

849
00:50:48,116 --> 00:50:49,948
It's suppose to be very thrilling for you.

850
00:50:49,955 --> 00:50:51,073
Just what do you think you're doing?

851
00:50:51,075 --> 00:50:52,416
Oh are we moving to fast?

852
00:50:52,418 --> 00:50:56,595
You're probably right. I should just
rescue you a few times before we get

853
00:50:56,603 --> 00:50:58,092
Whoops!

854
00:50:58,095 --> 00:51:01,911
Saved that, You are lucky to
have such a great hero here.

855
00:51:01,914 --> 00:51:04,543
Somebody do something?

856
00:51:04,545 --> 00:51:06,957
No wait, Duh! I gotcha.

857
00:51:13,543 --> 00:51:16,188
That was fun, you almost died.
But I saved you.

858
00:51:16,189 --> 00:51:18,083
- Ahhh, building!
- AHHHH!

859
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:22,415
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!

860
00:51:22,281 --> 00:51:23,696
Gotcha!

861
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:26,132
Whoo, I'm sorry.
What were you saying?

862
00:51:26,146 --> 00:51:28,559
I couldn't hear you over
the sound of me saving your life.

863
00:51:28,562 --> 00:51:30,499
Put me down, right now!

864
00:51:30,518 --> 00:51:33,081
Okay, all right, all right,
hold on.

865
00:51:35,736 --> 00:51:37,066
Are you crazy?

866
00:51:37,068 --> 00:51:40,752
I suppose I'm, a little crazy...
about you.

867
00:51:40,753 --> 00:51:42,421
Who are you? Really.

868
00:51:42,435 --> 00:51:46,753
Oooh, oooh, right. Well prepare
to have your mind blown, little lady.

869
00:51:48,053 --> 00:51:49,903
- Tada!
- Hal?

870
00:51:49,907 --> 00:51:52,498
Yeah, isn't this great?

871
00:51:52,502 --> 00:51:54,819
Now there's nothing keeping us apart.

872
00:51:54,824 --> 00:51:56,730
No, it's not great.

873
00:51:56,735 --> 00:52:01,100
Aww, our first fight. This is so us,
we're like an old married couple.

874
00:52:01,106 --> 00:52:04,216
There is no us, okay. There will
never be an us.

875
00:52:04,222 --> 00:52:06,814
But, I have powers.

876
00:52:06,818 --> 00:52:09,423
I have a cape, I'm the good guy.

877
00:52:09,424 --> 00:52:10,614
You are a good guy, Hal.

878
00:52:10,616 --> 00:52:13,473
But you don't understand we need to
find out why...

879
00:52:13,479 --> 00:52:16,085
Right now, this isn't right.

880
00:52:16,089 --> 00:52:17,955
- Listen to me, Hal.
- You're suppose to be with me.

881
00:52:17,959 --> 00:52:20,224
I'm trying to warn you, Hal.

882
00:52:20,228 --> 00:52:23,809
It's Tighten. It's TIGHTEN, not Hal.

883
00:52:47,323 --> 00:52:49,331
- Bernard.
- Roxanne.

884
00:52:49,335 --> 00:52:53,008
- Sorry I'm late.
- Wow, your hair looks exciting.

885
00:52:53,014 --> 00:52:56,159
Hmm, not the only exciting development
of the night.

886
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:58,621
Megamind's created a new hero.

887
00:52:58,622 --> 00:52:59,955
And I know why.

888
00:53:01,006 --> 00:53:02,553
It all makes sense now.

889
00:53:02,557 --> 00:53:07,112
He missed getting his butt kicked, so he created
a new hero to kick it for him.

890
00:53:07,462 --> 00:53:09,870
But why, Hal?

891
00:53:09,873 --> 00:53:13,005
Hal is the worst possible person
you could pick.

892
00:53:13,011 --> 00:53:15,363
Wow, that's a lot to take in.

893
00:53:15,367 --> 00:53:17,195
It, it boggles my mind.

894
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:19,201
I am extremely boggled.

895
00:53:19,205 --> 00:53:22,559
You know, I'm sure we'll get to the bottom
of who's kicking who's butt.

896
00:53:22,564 --> 00:53:23,565
But in the mean time.

897
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,886
Let's enjoy each other's company.

898
00:53:26,891 --> 00:53:30,129
I'm sorry, Bernard. Of course, your right,

899
00:53:30,133 --> 00:53:33,068
you know, I could use a breather.

900
00:53:33,078 --> 00:53:38,868
To, Bernard. For being the only normal
thing in my crazy upside down world.

901
00:53:38,879 --> 00:53:42,175
To... being normal.

902
00:53:52,476 --> 00:53:54,567
- Roxanne.
- Yes?

903
00:53:55,728 --> 00:53:57,767
Say I wasn't so normal.

904
00:53:58,446 --> 00:54:04,554
Say I was bald and had the complexion
of a popular primary color.

905
00:54:04,581 --> 00:54:07,590
As a random, not a specific example.

906
00:54:08,358 --> 00:54:10,216
Would you still enjoy my company?

907
00:54:10,217 --> 00:54:13,052
Of course, you don't judge a book by
its cover.

908
00:54:13,057 --> 00:54:14,682
Or a person from the outside.

909
00:54:14,685 --> 00:54:16,589
Oh, that's a relief to hear.

910
00:54:16,593 --> 00:54:18,367
You judge them based on their actions.

911
00:54:19,076 --> 00:54:21,645
Well that seems kinda petty,
don't you think.

912
00:54:50,208 --> 00:54:53,045
- You.
- What, what?

913
00:54:53,608 --> 00:54:55,936
Oh, don't look at me!

914
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,756
Just, just a technical glitch.

915
00:54:57,861 --> 00:54:59,127
Don't look yet.

916
00:54:59,456 --> 00:55:01,306
My bad.

917
00:55:04,496 --> 00:55:06,077
Where were we?

918
00:55:08,661 --> 00:55:10,409
Now, now, hold on.

919
00:55:10,413 --> 00:55:11,003
YOU!

920
00:55:31,201 --> 00:55:33,835
I can explain.

921
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:37,605
What about everything you just said?

922
00:55:37,608 --> 00:55:39,911
About judging a book by it's cover.

923
00:55:39,915 --> 00:55:43,258
Well let's take a look at the contents
then, shall we?

924
00:55:43,259 --> 00:55:44,693
You destroyed Metro Man.

925
00:55:44,697 --> 00:55:49,496
You took over the city and then you
actually got me to care about you.

926
00:55:50,932 --> 00:55:53,336
Why are you so evil?

927
00:55:53,348 --> 00:55:55,170
Tricking me?

928
00:55:55,176 --> 00:55:58,123
What could you possibly hope to gain?

929
00:56:02,789 --> 00:56:04,049
Wait a minute.

930
00:56:04,053 --> 00:56:06,832
Oh, I don't believe this.

931
00:56:10,093 --> 00:56:13,832
Do you really think that I would
ever be with you?

932
00:56:15,722 --> 00:56:17,727
No...

933
00:56:50,371 --> 00:56:53,491
Okay Minion, you were right.

934
00:56:53,501 --> 00:56:56,498
I was.... less right.

935
00:56:56,805 --> 00:56:59,092
We should stick to what we're good at.

936
00:56:59,096 --> 00:57:00,985
Being bad.

937
00:57:02,281 --> 00:57:03,295
Minion...

938
00:57:22,727 --> 00:57:23,730
You there.

939
00:57:24,819 --> 00:57:25,821
Yeah, you.

940
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:30,001
Bring out, the 'Black Mamba'!

941
00:58:02,284 --> 00:58:07,341
Okay, Titan it's time to go down,
in style.

942
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:33,919
I hear there's a new hero.

943
00:58:33,924 --> 00:58:36,383
Who dares to challenge my evil.

944
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:39,263
Where is the one they call, Titan?

945
00:58:42,275 --> 00:58:44,651
Challenge me, if you dare.

946
00:59:04,971 --> 00:59:06,649
Oh no, we're gonna crash.

947
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:12,330
This is embarrassing.

948
00:59:18,991 --> 00:59:21,176
Ballsy and incipient.

949
00:59:21,179 --> 00:59:24,973
Boneheaded, irresponsible.

950
00:59:25,244 --> 00:59:26,247
RUDE!

951
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:28,827
Unprofessional, that's what this is.

952
00:59:28,834 --> 00:59:32,342
Would Metro Man have kept me waiting?

953
00:59:32,343 --> 00:59:34,421
Of course not, he was a pro.

954
00:59:34,426 --> 00:59:37,265
Hey, Megamind. You're actually
the guy I want to see.

955
00:59:37,271 --> 00:59:38,951
Also, there's a door here.

956
00:59:38,954 --> 00:59:43,197
Do you have any idea how long
I waited for you?

957
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:44,727
No, no, no, I totally understand what you're saying.

958
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:47,432
Could you just shut up for one second, I'm trying
to beat this score.

959
00:59:47,437 --> 00:59:49,645
Were you even planning on showing up?

960
00:59:49,649 --> 00:59:51,287
What's this?

961
00:59:53,503 --> 00:59:55,832
Where did you get all this stuff?

962
00:59:55,837 --> 00:59:57,663
It doesn't belong to me.

963
00:59:57,767 --> 00:59:59,148
You stole it!

964
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:01,630
- Pretty cool, right.
- Oh no, no, no. You're a hero.

965
01:00:01,635 --> 01:00:03,252
Being a hero is for losers.

966
01:00:03,255 --> 01:00:06,023
It's work, work, work twenty four seven,
and for what?

967
01:00:06,028 --> 01:00:11,365
I only took the gig to get the girl. And it turns
out Roxanne doesn't want anything to do with me.

968
01:00:11,612 --> 01:00:13,031
Roxanne Ritchi?

969
01:00:13,034 --> 01:00:14,235
Yeah, Roxanne Ritchi.

970
01:00:14,238 --> 01:00:18,717
I saw her having dinner, and making googly eyes
at some intellectual dweeb.

971
01:00:18,724 --> 01:00:21,009
- Ohhhh
- Who needs all that noise.

972
01:00:21,013 --> 01:00:24,830
That's why I think, WE should
team up.

973
01:00:24,832 --> 01:00:26,124
You? Wait! What?

974
01:00:26,127 --> 01:00:28,736
With my power, and your big
headedness,

975
01:00:28,741 --> 01:00:30,621
we could rule the city.

976
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:33,300
- You want to team up?
- I even drew up some new costume designs.

977
01:00:33,304 --> 01:00:34,640
- See
- Costume design?

978
01:00:34,643 --> 01:00:38,319
You have a brain so you get a little brain
wearing glasses on your costume, or something.

979
01:00:38,325 --> 01:00:42,781
And since I'm the cool one, I'll have like
two tanks sword fighting.

980
01:00:43,169 --> 01:00:44,986
I can't believe you.

981
01:00:44,989 --> 01:00:52,373
All your gifts all your powers, and you
squander them for your own personal gain.

982
01:00:52,385 --> 01:00:54,006
- Yes!
- NO!

983
01:00:54,007 --> 01:00:59,077
I 'm the villain, you're the good guy.
I do something bad, and you come and get me.

984
01:00:59,085 --> 01:01:01,006
That's why I created you.

985
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:04,708
Yeah, right. You're nuts.

986
01:01:04,714 --> 01:01:07,182
- Space Dad told me.
- Look, I'm your Space Dad.

987
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,949
You should be more like Metro Man.

988
01:01:12,156 --> 01:01:13,214
You tricked me?

989
01:01:13,217 --> 01:01:15,106
Oh, don't like that, huh?

990
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:16,214
Well there's more.

991
01:01:17,745 --> 01:01:21,530
I'm also the intellectual dweeb
dating Roxanne.

992
01:01:21,953 --> 01:01:25,331
- No.
- And we were smooching.

993
01:01:25,337 --> 01:01:28,623
Mwah... Mwah... Mwah.

994
01:01:28,629 --> 01:01:30,561
When I get my hands on you
I'm gonna, gonna...

995
01:01:30,564 --> 01:01:32,355
YES! Yes I know.

996
01:01:32,359 --> 01:01:36,045
Break me in two. Oh god,
how I missed this.

997
01:01:39,349 --> 01:01:41,675
And the hero strikes the first blow.

998
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:43,898
But evil returns with a backhand.

999
01:01:48,695 --> 01:01:49,698
YES!

1000
01:01:54,935 --> 01:01:56,886
Ahh... shhhh.

1001
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,650
Come out you little freak!

1002
01:02:00,655 --> 01:02:03,647
I want to see what that big brain
looks like on the pavement.

1003
01:02:09,822 --> 01:02:12,994
You fell for the oldest evil trick in the book.

1004
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:15,409
You little blue, twerp.

1005
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:20,297
En Garde!

1006
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:26,234
Oh, now that's the spirit.

1007
01:02:26,247 --> 01:02:29,060
Take, that, and again!

1008
01:02:29,066 --> 01:02:32,436
Now it's time for some witty back
and forth banter.

1009
01:02:32,441 --> 01:02:34,511
You go first.

1010
01:02:34,512 --> 01:02:37,149
Look I'm not sure where you're
going at.

1011
01:02:38,733 --> 01:02:40,475
This one's for pursuing my girlfriend.

1012
01:02:46,119 --> 01:02:49,195
This one's for space Dad making a fool out of me.

1013
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,313
And Megamind! This is for
Space, Step-Mom.

1014
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:01,662
You lied to her!

1015
01:03:01,664 --> 01:03:05,564
Oh, well now, I thought that pummeling
went really, really well.

1016
01:03:05,570 --> 01:03:07,938
I mean, I have a few notes.

1017
01:03:07,943 --> 01:03:09,246
- Notes?
- But they can wait.

1018
01:03:09,249 --> 01:03:10,752
You can take me to jail now.

1019
01:03:10,755 --> 01:03:13,711
Oh, no, no, no. I was thinking
more like the morgue.

1020
01:03:13,717 --> 01:03:15,508
- You're dead!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1021
01:03:15,511 --> 01:03:17,017
This isn't how you play the game.

1022
01:03:17,021 --> 01:03:18,992
Game over.

1023
01:03:25,147 --> 01:03:26,151
Great button.

1024
01:03:31,799 --> 01:03:33,356
I'm calling time out.

1025
01:03:35,252 --> 01:03:36,476
Time out, time out!

1026
01:03:47,362 --> 01:03:49,964
Brain bots. Initiate the fail safe.

1027
01:03:56,944 --> 01:03:59,284
Guess what, Buster Brown?

1028
01:03:59,288 --> 01:04:02,874
It's made from Copper. You're powerless
against it.

1029
01:04:02,884 --> 01:04:05,782
It's a very safe metal used to defeat...

1030
01:04:06,178 --> 01:04:07,492
Metro Man?

1031
01:04:07,774 --> 01:04:11,366
You, should stop comparing me
to Metro Man.

1032
01:04:20,658 --> 01:04:23,187
You run Megamind,
but you can't hide.

1033
01:04:23,188 --> 01:04:25,164
We're saved, we're saved!

1034
01:04:25,177 --> 01:04:27,283
What's your name, new hero?

1035
01:04:27,287 --> 01:04:30,316
- It's Tighten.
- Thank you, thank you.

1036
01:04:30,321 --> 01:04:32,271
Tighten has freed us.

1037
01:04:32,274 --> 01:04:34,073
Oh I wouldn't say free.

1038
01:04:34,076 --> 01:04:37,022
More like, under new management.

1039
01:04:42,007 --> 01:04:43,427
What do you want?

1040
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:47,802
- Titan's turned evil.
- Congratulations, another one of your genius

1041
01:04:47,808 --> 01:04:50,321
And why did my doorman let you up?

1042
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:54,845
- Carlos?
- What are you, no, no!

1043
01:04:54,846 --> 01:04:56,259
I need your help.

1044
01:04:56,263 --> 01:04:58,102
Why do you need MY help?

1045
01:04:58,106 --> 01:05:02,370
Because you're the
smartest person I know.

1046
01:05:04,522 --> 01:05:05,939
Well you can't hide here.

1047
01:05:05,942 --> 01:05:08,167
Copper should have worked,
why didn't the copper work?

1048
01:05:08,171 --> 01:05:10,142
The copper worked perfectly well the last time.

1049
01:05:10,146 --> 01:05:11,795
Copper? You're not making any sense.

1050
01:05:11,798 --> 01:05:15,415
Look, if we don't find Titan's weakness.
He'll destroy the whole city.

1051
01:05:18,067 --> 01:05:19,904
Okay, how can I help?

1052
01:05:19,905 --> 01:05:22,794
We need to find answers.
You knew Metro Man best.

1053
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:27,256
Did he have a hideout, a cave, a solitary
fortress of some kind?

1054
01:05:27,263 --> 01:05:29,030
Anything that would give us clues.

1055
01:05:29,447 --> 01:05:32,423
Well, there is one place I know.

1056
01:05:34,208 --> 01:05:37,518
You gave him these powers, can't
you just take them away?

1057
01:05:37,524 --> 01:05:42,210
I can't, I lost my diffuser gun when I
misplaced the invisible car.

1058
01:05:42,217 --> 01:05:43,999
The night you dumped me.

1059
01:05:44,226 --> 01:05:46,362
Alone.

1060
01:05:46,123 --> 01:05:48,039
In the rain.

1061
01:05:48,733 --> 01:05:50,639
- Did you ever look back?
- NO!

1062
01:05:50,643 --> 01:05:54,548
- Oh, my giant blue head.
- I guess we're here.

1063
01:05:57,519 --> 01:06:00,780
So, this is where he hid it.

1064
01:06:00,786 --> 01:06:05,281
After all these years. My old shhool house.

1065
01:06:07,389 --> 01:06:10,723
You know, I think there's an
apology in order, for the other night.

1066
01:06:10,728 --> 01:06:12,735
Okay that would be nice.
But make it quick.

1067
01:06:12,739 --> 01:06:14,899
We have much more pressing
matters to deal with.

1068
01:06:18,301 --> 01:06:23,383
Wow, can't believe he kept
all this stuff.

1069
01:06:23,791 --> 01:06:26,585
Aww, I remember when he
wore that.

1070
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:28,059
Can you just stay focused here?

1071
01:06:28,062 --> 01:06:30,022
Yes of course, you're right, focused.

1072
01:06:30,877 --> 01:06:33,046
HEY! Come over and look at this.

1073
01:06:33,048 --> 01:06:36,377
What is it?

1074
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,426
Um..... look!

1075
01:06:39,657 --> 01:06:42,563
This glass has ice cubes in it.

1076
01:06:42,567 --> 01:06:44,980
Yes, that's what happens when water gets cold.

1077
01:06:44,985 --> 01:06:46,547
No, what I'm saying is,

1078
01:06:46,549 --> 01:06:50,710
don't you think it's a little odd that
the ice hasn't melted yet?

1079
01:06:50,717 --> 01:06:52,297
One of life’s great mysteries.

1080
01:06:59,323 --> 01:07:00,505
Hey.

1081
01:07:00,507 --> 01:07:01,510
AHHHHHHHHHHH!

1082
01:07:12,536 --> 01:07:14,249
We now run a confirmed report.

1083
01:07:14,252 --> 01:07:18,144
Tighten, first thought to be the
City's new hero, has turned evil.

1084
01:07:18,151 --> 01:07:21,218
The city has never seen this level
of destruction.

1085
01:07:21,223 --> 01:07:23,548
If only Metro Man were still alive.

1086
01:07:23,552 --> 01:07:25,456
- You're alive?
- You're alive.

1087
01:07:26,481 --> 01:07:27,444
I'm alive.

1088
01:07:27,446 --> 01:07:30,020
But..we..we
saw your skeleton.

1089
01:07:30,025 --> 01:07:32,195
- You were dead.
- Are you a ghost?

1090
01:07:32,198 --> 01:07:36,276
There had better be, an amazing
explanation for this.

1091
01:07:36,282 --> 01:07:38,565
Speak, apparition.

1092
01:07:47,832 --> 01:07:50,840
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1093
01:07:50,845 --> 01:07:52,304
You both deserve the truth.

1094
01:07:52,663 --> 01:07:54,855
It all started back at the observatory.

1095
01:07:54,859 --> 01:07:58,728
Roxanne was kidnapped, I was gonna
stop you.

1096
01:07:58,729 --> 01:08:01,840
My head wasn't in the game that day.

1097
01:08:01,841 --> 01:08:05,465
We were kinda going through the motions.
So...

1098
01:08:05,467 --> 01:08:07,985
Using my super speed.

1099
01:08:07,995 --> 01:08:09,707
I decided to go clear my head.

1100
01:08:11,586 --> 01:08:17,133
Then I realized we had done this same
silly charade our entire lives.

1101
01:08:18,204 --> 01:08:20,640
I tried to get my mind off how I was feeling.

1102
01:08:20,641 --> 01:08:23,360
But I just felt stuck.

1103
01:08:23,737 --> 01:08:27,549
I began to realize, despite all my powers,

1104
01:08:27,556 --> 01:08:31,077
each and every citizen of Metro had
something I didn't.

1105
01:08:31,692 --> 01:08:33,162
A choice.

1106
01:08:34,145 --> 01:08:38,122
Ever since I can remember I've always
had to be what the City wanted me to be.

1107
01:08:39,064 --> 01:08:41,050
But what about what I wanted to do?

1108
01:08:42,288 --> 01:08:45,002
Then it suddenly hit me.

1109
01:08:45,003 --> 01:08:46,770
I do have a choice.

1110
01:08:47,604 --> 01:08:50,153
I can be whatever I want to be.

1111
01:08:50,572 --> 01:08:53,126
No one said this hero thing had to
be a life time gig.

1112
01:08:53,894 --> 01:08:55,587
You can't just quit either.

1113
01:08:56,397 --> 01:08:58,561
That's when I got the brilliant idea...

1114
01:08:59,849 --> 01:09:01,252
...to fake my death.

1115
01:09:01,735 --> 01:09:04,718
Copper drains my powers!

1116
01:09:04,723 --> 01:09:06,423
You're weakness is copper?

1117
01:09:06,845 --> 01:09:08,732
Once your death ray hit.

1118
01:09:09,648 --> 01:09:12,110
I never felt so alive.

1119
01:09:12,263 --> 01:09:15,147
So I borrowed a prop from a nearby
nursing school.

1120
01:09:15,445 --> 01:09:18,336
Metro Man was finally dead.

1121
01:09:18,713 --> 01:09:20,123
And Music Man was born.

1122
01:09:20,124 --> 01:09:21,288
Music man?

1123
01:09:21,291 --> 01:09:22,748
That way I can keep my logo.

1124
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:23,753
- WHAT?
- 'Cause of what?

1125
01:09:23,757 --> 01:09:27,441
Finally I'm free, to get in touch
with my true power.

1126
01:09:27,448 --> 01:09:29,628
Weaving lyrical magic.

1127
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:30,773
Check this out.

1128
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:34,682
<i>I have eyes that can see</i>

1129
01:09:34,687 --> 01:09:38,697
<i>right through leaaadd.</i>

1130
01:09:38,703 --> 01:09:40,743
- Ewww
- Granted you have talent,

1131
01:09:40,748 --> 01:09:44,455
But there's a mad man out there
destroying our... your city.

1132
01:09:45,664 --> 01:09:47,023
Why did you do this?

1133
01:09:47,699 --> 01:09:49,802
The people of the city relied on you,

1134
01:09:49,806 --> 01:09:53,843
and you deserted them.

1135
01:09:53,849 --> 01:09:54,956
No offense.

1136
01:09:54,959 --> 01:09:56,118
No, I'm with you.

1137
01:09:56,404 --> 01:09:58,501
Look, we need your help.

1138
01:09:58,508 --> 01:10:01,359
I'm sorry, I really am.

1139
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:03,566
Um, I'm, I'm done.

1140
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:07,576
You know, little buddy. There's a Ying
for every Yang.

1141
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:11,150
If there's bad, good will rise up
against it.

1142
01:10:11,895 --> 01:10:14,630
It's taken me a long time to
find my calling.

1143
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:18,338
Now it's about time, you find yours.

1144
01:10:23,696 --> 01:10:25,494
Hey, who needs him.

1145
01:10:25,498 --> 01:10:27,487
We can beat Tighten ourselves.

1146
01:10:27,491 --> 01:10:30,359
I say we go back to the evil lair.
Grab some ray guns,

1147
01:10:30,362 --> 01:10:33,190
hold them sideways, and just go
all gangsta on 'em.

1148
01:10:34,005 --> 01:10:35,008
We can't

1149
01:10:35,011 --> 01:10:37,252
So that's it? You're just giving up?

1150
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:38,992
I'm the bad guy.

1151
01:10:38,996 --> 01:10:42,611
I don't save the day.
I don't fly off into the sunset,

1152
01:10:42,612 --> 01:10:44,800
and I don't get the girl.

1153
01:10:45,857 --> 01:10:46,859
I'm going home.

1154
01:11:16,757 --> 01:11:18,961
Unless someone comes
to our aid soon,

1155
01:11:18,967 --> 01:11:20,841
all may be lost.

1156
01:11:21,999 --> 01:11:25,269
Thousands have already fled the city
in a mass exodus.

1157
01:11:25,277 --> 01:11:29,408
Remaining citizens are warned, to stay
indoors until further notice.

1158
01:11:30,924 --> 01:11:36,076
Authorities have issued a warning, to stay
out of the downtown area at all costs.

1159
01:11:48,175 --> 01:11:49,182
Hal!

1160
01:11:50,887 --> 01:11:51,890
Hal!

1161
01:11:53,071 --> 01:11:56,581
Let me guess, after seeing how awesome I am,

1162
01:11:56,582 --> 01:11:58,215
you've finally come to your senses.

1163
01:11:58,219 --> 01:11:59,705
Well, I'm over you.

1164
01:11:59,708 --> 01:12:01,372
I've come to stop you, Hal.

1165
01:12:01,376 --> 01:12:05,360
You? Oh, well. Okay, what are you
going to do, report me to death?

1166
01:12:05,366 --> 01:12:07,183
I was going to try
reasoning with you.

1167
01:12:07,187 --> 01:12:10,043
You and I, we worked together
for a long time.

1168
01:12:10,047 --> 01:12:11,693
I know you.

1169
01:12:11,697 --> 01:12:12,939
You don't know me.

1170
01:12:12,963 --> 01:12:15,343
You never took the time to know me.

1171
01:12:15,348 --> 01:12:20,388
This is the first time we've hung out socially.
And it's when I'm about to destroy the city.

1172
01:12:20,389 --> 01:12:21,600
I want to talk to the real Hal.

1173
01:12:21,602 --> 01:12:25,661
I want to talk to the guy who loved being
a camera man, and eating dip,

1174
01:12:25,668 --> 01:12:29,235
And being a nerd and being not as scary
as the Tighten-Hal.

1175
01:12:29,241 --> 01:12:30,545
To late!

1176
01:12:37,035 --> 01:12:38,683
Megamind.

1177
01:12:40,482 --> 01:12:43,294
You and I have some unfinished business.

1178
01:12:43,343 --> 01:12:47,745
I'll be waiting at Metro Tower,
oh, and just so you don't get cold feet.

1179
01:12:49,150 --> 01:12:50,826
Roxanne!

1180
01:12:50,829 --> 01:12:54,576
Come on Roxi, call for your hero
to come rescue you.

1181
01:12:55,752 --> 01:12:56,854
Megamind.

1182
01:12:57,624 --> 01:13:00,322
I don't even know if you're listening,
but if you are...

1183
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:02,758
You can't give up.

1184
01:13:04,097 --> 01:13:08,336
The Megamind I knew would never
have run from a fight.

1185
01:13:08,344 --> 01:13:11,750
Even when he knew he had absolutely
no chance of winning.

1186
01:13:11,761 --> 01:13:14,292
It was your best quality.

1187
01:13:14,587 --> 01:13:17,747
You need to be that guy,
right now.

1188
01:13:19,164 --> 01:13:21,177
The city needs you.

1189
01:13:23,494 --> 01:13:25,003
I need you.

1190
01:13:25,006 --> 01:13:26,454
Roxanne.

1191
01:13:26,455 --> 01:13:31,025
You have one hour.
Don't... keep me waiting.

1192
01:13:32,594 --> 01:13:35,072
Warden, Warden!

1193
01:13:35,076 --> 01:13:38,790
Listen to me, you have to let me go.
Tighten has to be stopped.

1194
01:13:38,797 --> 01:13:42,538
Sorry Megamind, you still have 88 life
sentences to go.

1195
01:13:42,827 --> 01:13:45,320
Plenty of time to reflect on what
you've done.

1196
01:13:45,327 --> 01:13:48,728
If you want to hear me say it?
I'll say it.

1197
01:13:48,735 --> 01:13:52,485
Here it is. Black is part of my heart.

1198
01:13:54,611 --> 01:13:59,524
I.... AM.... Sorry!

1199
01:14:00,787 --> 01:14:02,397
Not buying it.

1200
01:14:04,665 --> 01:14:06,202
I don't blame you.

1201
01:14:07,432 --> 01:14:09,833
I've terrorized the city
countless times.

1202
01:14:10,557 --> 01:14:13,489
Created a hero who's turned out
to be a villain.

1203
01:14:14,761 --> 01:14:16,446
I lied to Roxanne, and...

1204
01:14:17,373 --> 01:14:19,569
My best friend, Minion.

1205
01:14:20,584 --> 01:14:22,211
I treated like dirt.

1206
01:14:24,616 --> 01:14:26,658
Please, don't make this city,

1207
01:14:27,992 --> 01:14:31,995
Don't make Roxanne pay for my
wrong doings.

1208
01:14:33,076 --> 01:14:37,270
Apology accepted.

1209
01:14:40,327 --> 01:14:43,847
Uh, Minion. You fantastic fish, you.

1210
01:14:43,858 --> 01:14:45,507
What are we waiting for?

1211
01:14:45,610 --> 01:14:47,128
We'd better get going.

1212
01:14:50,427 --> 01:14:51,431
You got me!

1213
01:14:54,023 --> 01:14:55,535
Good luck, fellows.

1214
01:14:55,547 --> 01:14:56,708
We're gonna die!

1215
01:14:58,624 --> 01:14:59,677
Wait, what?

1216
01:14:59,951 --> 01:15:01,325
Hey, Metro losers.

1217
01:15:01,327 --> 01:15:03,159
This is Metro Tower.

1218
01:15:03,574 --> 01:15:07,005
They say it's suppose to be a
symbol of our cities strength.

1219
01:15:07,045 --> 01:15:11,825
But, for me, it's a reminder of the day
this woman ferociously ripped out my heart.

1220
01:15:11,832 --> 01:15:14,398
And I hate reminders.

1221
01:15:27,308 --> 01:15:28,558
HAL!

1222
01:15:30,825 --> 01:15:32,029
Please don't do this.

1223
01:15:32,032 --> 01:15:34,823
I know there's still good in you, Hal.

1224
01:15:34,827 --> 01:15:36,395
You're so naive, Roxie.

1225
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:39,683
You see the good in everybody,
even when it's not there.

1226
01:15:39,693 --> 01:15:42,063
You're weaving a fantasy.

1227
01:15:42,072 --> 01:15:43,783
There is no Easter bunny.

1228
01:15:43,788 --> 01:15:45,315
There is no tooth fairy.

1229
01:15:45,317 --> 01:15:47,385
And there is no Queen of England.

1230
01:15:48,091 --> 01:15:51,337
This is the real world.
And you need to wake up.

1231
01:16:03,519 --> 01:16:06,565
You dare to challenge Megamind?

1232
01:16:06,605 --> 01:16:09,854
This town isn't big enough for
two super villains.

1233
01:16:09,859 --> 01:16:13,120
Oh, you're a villain all right.

1234
01:16:13,125 --> 01:16:15,343
Just not the super one.

1235
01:16:15,347 --> 01:16:17,087
Yeah, what’s the difference?

1236
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:22,810
PRESENTATION!

1237
01:16:42,213 --> 01:16:43,820
I knew you'd come back.

1238
01:16:43,823 --> 01:16:46,724
Well, that makes one of us.

1239
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:17,312
- What's the plan?
- Well, mostly involves, not dying.

1240
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:18,493
I, like that plan.

1241
01:17:42,473 --> 01:17:43,627
I can't control it.

1242
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:00,456
No!

1243
01:18:03,343 --> 01:18:04,557
Well, that was easy.

1244
01:18:04,561 --> 01:18:07,121
Looks like there's only one loose
end now.

1245
01:18:18,175 --> 01:18:21,565
Please, let's have a little respect
for public transportation.

1246
01:18:22,236 --> 01:18:24,062
You came back.

1247
01:18:24,066 --> 01:18:25,806
You were right, Roxanne.

1248
01:18:25,810 --> 01:18:27,508
I never should have left.

1249
01:18:27,513 --> 01:18:29,926
Whoa, I... I thought you were dead.

1250
01:18:29,932 --> 01:18:33,088
My death was, greatly exaggerated.

1251
01:18:33,099 --> 01:18:36,555
So, you're the punk I've heard about.

1252
01:18:38,534 --> 01:18:39,537
Whoa!

1253
01:18:48,374 --> 01:18:53,007
I'm sorry, I did the best I could.

1254
01:18:54,856 --> 01:18:56,695
I'm so proud of you.

1255
01:19:00,372 --> 01:19:01,490
Minion?

1256
01:19:02,690 --> 01:19:05,084
Surprise! Heh, heh, heh.

1257
01:19:05,707 --> 01:19:07,546
He's the real hero.

1258
01:19:14,386 --> 01:19:15,649
Megamind.

1259
01:19:17,543 --> 01:19:19,148
Going somewhere?

1260
01:19:19,531 --> 01:19:21,451
Besides jail.

1261
01:19:28,688 --> 01:19:30,829
No, not in the face there, please.

1262
01:19:30,830 --> 01:19:32,050
If you know what's good
for you Tighten.

1263
01:19:32,052 --> 01:19:34,153
You'll stay out of Montrosity.

1264
01:19:34,158 --> 01:19:35,401
- You got it!
- Good!

1265
01:20:10,375 --> 01:20:12,402
Pretty sneaky, sis.

1266
01:20:12,406 --> 01:20:16,347
But there is only one person I
know who calls this town, Montrosity.

1267
01:20:16,352 --> 01:20:17,404
Ooops.

1268
01:20:17,891 --> 01:20:18,893
You!

1269
01:20:22,534 --> 01:20:24,532
Bet you think it's really funny, huh?

1270
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:28,324
Let's all laugh at the really cool guy, huh.

1271
01:20:31,179 --> 01:20:34,123
You're not going to be laughing no more.

1272
01:20:34,124 --> 01:20:37,571
The invisible car. Hey, remember
that night that I dumped you?

1273
01:20:38,671 --> 01:20:40,545
You are bringing this up now?

1274
01:20:40,548 --> 01:20:42,284
I did look back.

1275
01:20:43,895 --> 01:20:44,897
You did?

1276
01:20:45,256 --> 01:20:46,409
YOU DID!

1277
01:20:46,422 --> 01:20:49,997
Yes, and you should look back,
right now.

1278
01:20:50,914 --> 01:20:52,762
Oh, I get it.

1279
01:21:00,427 --> 01:21:03,434
This is the last time you'll make
a fool out of me.

1280
01:21:03,443 --> 01:21:05,784
I made you a hero.

1281
01:21:05,788 --> 01:21:09,453
You did the fool thing,
all by yourself.

1282
01:21:12,366 --> 01:21:14,421
Oh, uh...

1283
01:21:16,677 --> 01:21:18,227
You're so pathetic.

1284
01:21:18,229 --> 01:21:20,029
No matter what side you're on.

1285
01:21:20,033 --> 01:21:21,733
You're always the looser.

1286
01:21:21,907 --> 01:21:23,965
There's a benefit to loosing.

1287
01:21:24,410 --> 01:21:26,365
You get to learn from your mistakes.

1288
01:21:28,736 --> 01:21:29,740
What?

1289
01:21:31,473 --> 01:21:33,826
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

1290
01:21:33,831 --> 01:21:36,297
Minion, if I live, I will kill you.

1291
01:21:46,795 --> 01:21:48,600
Enjoy your flight.

1292
01:21:49,145 --> 01:21:50,358
AHHHHHHHHHHH!

1293
01:21:50,465 --> 01:21:51,960
Megamind.

1294
01:21:59,551 --> 01:22:02,004
So, this is how it ends.

1295
01:22:02,457 --> 01:22:06,506
Normally I'd chalk this up to my last
glorious failure.

1296
01:22:07,977 --> 01:22:09,287
But not today!

1297
01:22:10,359 --> 01:22:11,526
What can I say?

1298
01:22:11,951 --> 01:22:13,734
Old habits die hard.

1299
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:22,420
Say bye, bye Roxie.

1300
01:22:27,258 --> 01:22:28,598
Ollo.

1301
01:22:37,915 --> 01:22:41,018
Thing about bad guys,
they always LOOSE!

1302
01:22:41,952 --> 01:22:43,240
Ohhhh.

1303
01:22:45,953 --> 01:22:47,919
You did it, you won.

1304
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:51,160
Well, I finally had a reason to win.

1305
01:22:52,181 --> 01:22:53,354
You.

1306
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:02,663
MINION!

1307
01:23:02,692 --> 01:23:07,599
Can't see it's cold and...
warm, and dark and light.

1308
01:23:07,607 --> 01:23:09,020
It's me, Minion.

1309
01:23:09,023 --> 01:23:10,419
I'm right here.

1310
01:23:10,422 --> 01:23:12,425
We've had a lot of adventures together.

1311
01:23:12,429 --> 01:23:13,634
You and I.

1312
01:23:13,637 --> 01:23:14,864
We have, Minion.

1313
01:23:14,865 --> 01:23:17,401
I mean...

1314
01:23:17,407 --> 01:23:21,915
most of them ended in horrible
failure, but,

1315
01:23:21,922 --> 01:23:25,702
We won today.
Didn't we, sir?

1316
01:23:25,703 --> 01:23:28,227
Yes Minion, we did it.

1317
01:23:28,232 --> 01:23:29,606
Thanks to you.

1318
01:23:29,610 --> 01:23:33,568
Code-We're the good guys now.

1319
01:23:33,574 --> 01:23:36,810
Code-I guess we are.

1320
01:23:38,177 --> 01:23:41,137
Oh, oh. I'm going... I mean this is...

1321
01:23:41,142 --> 01:23:43,863
This is it, I mean I'm going far awa...

1322
01:23:54,302 --> 01:23:56,246
Oh, what a drama queen.

1323
01:23:57,073 --> 01:23:58,840
You know, I'm feeling much better now.

1324
01:23:58,850 --> 01:24:00,631
I guess I just needed a swim

1325
01:24:00,634 --> 01:24:02,442
- He had you, didn't he.
- Whew!

1326
01:24:02,445 --> 01:24:04,987
Classic, Minion.
Don't give them the face.

1327
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:07,458
There he is with that
little face. Look at that face.

1328
01:24:07,463 --> 01:24:09,929
We did it!
We did it!

1329
01:24:09,932 --> 01:24:12,044
- Fist pump!
- You did it!

1330
01:24:12,048 --> 01:24:13,909
We won, we won, we won.

1331
01:24:13,913 --> 01:24:17,965
What! Get back you savages!

1332
01:24:17,971 --> 01:24:22,035
Sorry, sorry. He's just not used to
positive feedback.

1333
01:24:25,364 --> 01:24:29,929
Funny, I guess destiny is not the

1334
01:24:32,492 --> 01:24:34,993
But the path we choose
for ourselves.

1335
01:24:43,227 --> 01:24:45,353
All right, put your hands in the air.

1336
01:24:48,910 --> 01:24:50,865
Now hand over your wallets.

1337
01:24:50,866 --> 01:24:53,728
I'm just kidding.

1338
01:24:53,729 --> 01:24:55,412
Just kidding.

1339
01:24:55,416 --> 01:24:57,014
I have to admit.

1340
01:24:57,018 --> 01:24:59,976
Being good, has its perks.

1341
01:25:01,172 --> 01:25:03,814
You know, you look pretty good
in white.

1342
01:25:04,127 --> 01:25:07,984
Megamind, if you please.

1343
01:25:11,669 --> 01:25:13,900
Uh, hey, my kid can't see.

1344
01:25:13,904 --> 01:25:15,973
Sorry my friend.

1345
01:25:15,978 --> 01:25:20,037
Way to go, little buddy.
I knew you had it in you.

1346
01:25:20,043 --> 01:25:23,281
Ladies and gentlemen...
MEGAMIND!

1347
01:25:23,287 --> 01:25:26,021
Defender of Metro City.

1348
01:25:27,864 --> 01:25:30,917
You know, I like the sound of that.

1349
01:25:31,268 --> 01:25:32,301
Hit it!

1350
01:25:33,133 --> 01:25:36,429
<i>I'm Bad, I'm Bad-
