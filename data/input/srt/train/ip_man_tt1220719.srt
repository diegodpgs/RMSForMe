1
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,323
Fo Shan's citizens were well off
and practiced kung-fu as a hobby.

2
00:01:50,423 --> 00:01:52,137
Martial clubs became popular,

3
00:01:52,138 --> 00:01:55,507
turning Fo Shan into a province
renowned for martial arts.

4
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,583
Martial Arts Street in Fo Shan, 1935

5
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:22,297
Another competitor.

6
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:23,474
Okay, let's start practicing.

7
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:25,371
Come on, ready...

8
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,272
One...

9
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:28,437
Two...

10
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,913
One... two...

11
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,650
Sir, a Master Liu is looking for you.

12
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,589
May I know who you are?

13
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,493
I'm the patriarch of the Liu Fist Sect.

14
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,699
I just started a martial club in Fo Shan.

15
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:24,928
Congratulations.

16
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:28,963
I hear that Master Ip
is a Wing Chun expert.

17
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:32,167
I'd love to practice with you today.

18
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,235
Can we do it some other day?

19
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,642
It's not convenient right now.

20
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,497
Since I'm already here,

21
00:03:37,597 --> 00:03:40,644
let's just play around for a bit.

22
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:44,550
It's all private.
No one else shall know who wins.

23
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,555
It's not a matter of winning.
I'm having dinner.

24
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,524
In that case... I'll wait for you.

25
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,537
Master Liu.

26
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:03,434
Have you eaten yet?

27
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,239
Please join me.

28
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:43,876
You want one?

29
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:46,608
No, thanks.

30
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,727
Is the food all right tonight?

31
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,524
Very good indeed.

32
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,298
That's good.

33
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:06,494
Very quick.

34
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:18,782
Leave it, Uncle Wang.
Close the door first.

35
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,039
Master Liu.

36
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:00,658
Please!

37
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:02,491
Please!

38
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,372
Are you okay?

39
00:06:31,472 --> 00:06:32,651
I'm fine...

40
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,382
Let's start again!

41
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,555
Okay, here I come.

42
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,700
Touché!

43
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,631
Touché!

44
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,162
All touché!

45
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,814
Thanks for being lenient, Master Liu.

46
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,193
Thanks for teaching me.
I've learned a lot.

47
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:20,836
The pleasure was all mine.

48
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,924
Regarding this private duel, Master Ip...

49
00:07:24,024 --> 00:07:26,706
I won't tell anyone. Don't worry.

50
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,946
Thanks so much. I'm so grateful.

51
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,037
Goodbye.

52
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:32,740
Farewell.

53
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,048
So long.

54
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,954
With "Move 1000 Catties with 4 Taels",

55
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:43,561
Ip pushed Master Liu's whole body away.

56
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,597
Isn't "Move 1000 Catties with 4 Taels" 
Tai Chi?

57
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,665
I thought Master Ip practiced Wing Chun.

58
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,828
Anyway, 
he pushed him away with one hand.

59
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,503
Liu refused to admit defeat.

60
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,105
Ip kept chasing after him fiercely!

61
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:57,608
But Liu remained 
indignant after being hit.

62
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,869
He jumped at Ip like a hungry dog.

63
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,113
These tea leaves are 
pretty good and cheap.

64
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,286
Thank you.

65
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:08,884
Got to go.
Farewell.

66
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,080
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, see you next time.

67
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,890
Who put these here, Uncle Ping?

68
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,553
Your brother.

69
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,523
I thought Liu was good 
but he's so bad at defence...

70
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,827
and was beaten up like a pighead.

71
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:28,272
He co-owns his dad's 
restaurant. He's always idle.

72
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,539
Ask that kid to serve the customers.

73
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:31,543
Good morning.

74
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:32,444
Brother Ip!

75
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,494
Morning, Master Ip.

76
00:08:33,594 --> 00:08:34,394
Is Quan here yet?

77
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,845
He's waiting for you upstairs.

78
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,613
Been here long, Quan?

79
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:42,543
You're always late.

80
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,553
I'm busy.

81
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:46,849
Busy with what?

82
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:51,489
Drinking tea, eating, practicing.

83
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,123
What else?

84
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,759
This tea smells nice.

85
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,768
I'm talking about you.

86
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,803
Have you ordered yet?

87
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,836
I got something to discuss with you.

88
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,271
Let's eat first and then we'll talk.

89
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,704
This just came out of the oven! 
Try it...

90
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,183
Heard that you had 
a duel with Master Liu...

91
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,985
and had beaten him quickly. 
Is that true?

92
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,022
Who told you that, Lin?

93
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,985
My brother.

94
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:22,649
Should've told me earlier. 
I'm his disciple now!

95
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,121
But you've been 
a disciple of every master.

96
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,666
Was it a private duel, Brother Ip?

97
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,967
We have things to discuss. 
Leave us for now.

98
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,262
Then I won't disturb 
your private conversation.

99
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:51,681
Good!

100
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,188
- Morning, Master! 
- Morning.

101
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:54,994
Morning.

102
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:55,894
Master.

103
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,959
I heard that you were beaten by Ip Man.

104
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,277
Everyone in Fo Shan knows about it now.

105
00:09:59,377 --> 00:10:00,816
Nonsense! Who told you that?

106
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,629
Yuan at the restaurant.

107
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,129
Everything is expensive 
in Fo Shan these days.

108
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,271
So what?

109
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,938
That means the 
economy is good in Fo Shan.

110
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,504
Everybody can afford to spend money.

111
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,112
Is that so?

112
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,744
Clothing is the most 
important in our daily lives.

113
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:26,186
There will be lots of 
demand for future clothing.

114
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:30,290
I'll open a cotton mill
to provide cotton for them.

115
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,633
I want you to be my partner.

116
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,164
I don't know anything about business.

117
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:39,962
But I do.

118
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:41,403
I'm not in need of money.

119
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,106
Who's Yuan? Show yourself!

120
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,642
I am

121
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,344
You rascal. You ruined my reputation.

122
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,253
I must teach you a lesson!

123
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,887
Master...

124
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,187
He's my brother. Let's talk.

125
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,916
Calm down. Okay, Master?

126
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,193
Your brother?
He ruined my reputation.

127
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,689
He said I was beaten by Ip Man.

128
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,799
What's gonna happen to my martial club?

129
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,698
Who will want to be my disciples?

130
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:11,901
Apologize!

131
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,001
I didn't do anything wrong. 
I told the truth!

132
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,970
You're bullshitting again! 
You... Master...

133
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,037
Master Ip is upstairs. 
Seek him out if you have guts!

134
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,776
What? Go!

135
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,942
Take it easy, Master...

136
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,247
Master...

137
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,184
Don't be angry, Master.

138
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,260
I've been wronged, Master Ip.

139
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:36,820
Master,

140
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:37,729
please tell everybody...

141
00:11:37,777 --> 00:11:40,027
you've defeated Master Liu in a duel.

142
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,271
Master Ip...

143
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,137
You got to clear my name.

144
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,977
You liar, 
why're you bothering Brother Ip?

145
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,545
I'm no liar.

146
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,852
I saw the duel when 
I was picking up my kite.

147
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,050
Your kite got lost
and fell into Brother Ip's house.

148
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:09,250
You saw the whole duel
between the two masters.

149
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,192
Isn't that too much of a coincidence?

150
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,423
That's exactly what happened.

151
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,846
Even if it's true, 
you shouldn't have told everyone.

152
00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:16,128
You're not supposed 
to tell certain things

153
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,293
What's wrong with 
telling the truth?

154
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,768
That might cause 
embarrassment for others.

155
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,771
What embarrassment? I don't know how!

156
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,208
This is embarrassment!

157
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,779
You don't need to do that, Lin.

158
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:32,974
Why're you laughing? 
You think I'm invisible?

159
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,010
Captain... it's no big deal.

160
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:36,922
What's no big deal?

161
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,957
- Leave!
- Don't you leave!

162
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,089
Captain, it's no big deal.

163
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,521
I saw everything. I'm warning you...

164
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:46,455
I'll nab whoever causes 
trouble in my district.

165
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:48,922
I didn't cause any trouble.

166
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:52,204
Someone ruined my name. 
I'm here to claim justice.

167
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,431
What justice? I am justice.

168
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,876
You hooligans are fighting all the time.

169
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,439
What age are we in now?

170
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,080
Still talking about martial arts?

171
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,176
We're talking about arms and guns!

172
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,375
Guns. Got it?

173
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,236
You know, Captain Li...

174
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,446
We martial artists are energetic.

175
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,009
Sometimes we might be a bit too loud.

176
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,848
But that doesn't mean 
we're not civilized.

177
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:45,852
We're civilized folks.
Please don't pull the gun.

178
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,447
Cut me some slack.

179
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,224
Lin, set a table for Captain Li. 
It's on me.

180
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,594
Yes... Captain Li, this way please.

181
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:55,849
What you looking at? Get lost

182
00:13:55,949 --> 00:13:57,368
Don't stare. Don't stare... 
Get out of the way.

183
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:58,737
Please.

184
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:03,739
Master Liu.

185
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:05,977
As you please.

186
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,180
Why so secretive?

187
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,320
I'm really not good at business.

188
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:23,326
Take this to set up the mill.
Pay me back if you make a profit.

189
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,531
It'll be a while before I can repay you.

190
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,426
Take your time.

191
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:33,631
Another request: 
Take my son as your disciple.

192
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:38,001
There're so many martial club masters. 
Ask them.

193
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,011
None of them is better than you.

194
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:42,408
We're similar.

195
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,233
Brother Ip.

196
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,340
Lin.

197
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:46,983
Brother Quan.

198
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:50,983
I learned some new moves. 
Practice with me

199
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,582
You got so much time. 
You found your brother?

200
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,025
Let him be.

201
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,127
He'll come back once 
he spent all his money.

202
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:58,585
Let's try.

203
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,332
Dad, did Uncle Ip agree?

204
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:04,628
Let's go watch over there.

205
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,075
You draw very well, Zhun.

206
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,973
What new moves have you learned? 
Let's see.

207
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,044
Brother Ip, my master says,

208
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:18,980
this move is offense
and defense all in one.

209
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,449
Attack while defending. 
Defend while attacking.

210
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,148
Aren't they the same?

211
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,313
Go away, ignorant kid.

212
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,592
Here I come.

213
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,198
This move attacks the midrib.

214
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:44,035
Stop reciting mantras. 
Hit your target.

215
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,138
Mom, I'm done with my drawing.

216
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,713
So beautiful. Show it to Dad.

217
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,983
Hit to disperse. 
Disperse while hitting

218
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,499
My last move was 
"disperse while hitting"...

219
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:55,565
Dad, look.

220
00:15:55,665 --> 00:15:57,053
Wait. I'm busy at the moment

221
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,436
- You don't get it? 
- No.

222
00:15:58,536 --> 00:15:59,570
Come again if you don't get it.

223
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,682
Try again

224
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,361
Dad doesn't want to see it.

225
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:12,298
There you go.
What?

226
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,968
That was "disperse while hitting" 
Once more, Master Ip.

227
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,235
I couldn't see clearly.

228
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,708
See? What do you wanna see?

229
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,410
You guys fight every day. 
Aren't you tired?

230
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,452
You okay, Brother Ip?

231
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,493
Sorry, Mrs. Ip.

232
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:40,596
Goodbye, Mrs. Ip.

233
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,494
I wasn't talking about you.

234
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,569
No, there're things to 
take care of at the mill.

235
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,137
Yao.

236
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,459
I gotta go, Uncle Ip.

237
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:55,342
Okay, see you next time.

238
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,544
Bye, Ip.

239
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,047
Talk to me if you're not happy.

240
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,184
No need to throw a tantrum.

241
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,797
Okay, please take a look
at your son's drawing.

242
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,760
Spend more time with 
him and less with your pals.

243
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:20,665
Let's go inside, okay?

244
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:23,438
Go.

245
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:50,457
Brother.

246
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:51,761
Where's the martial club street?

247
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:53,702
Martial club!

248
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:55,595
Go straight ahead.

249
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:29,239
One, two...

250
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,376
Which martial club should 
be challenge first, Bro?

251
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,708
One... two!

252
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,175
One...

253
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:40,285
Back!

254
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,319
You teach martial arts here?

255
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,321
Come in if you wanna learn.

256
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,181
Who's the patriarch?

257
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,651
I am.

258
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,418
My name is Jin.

259
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:54,396
I came here because Fo Shan 
is famous for martial arts.

260
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,731
I'd like to practice with 
Fo Shan's martial artists.

261
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,228
Practice?

262
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,407
Yes!

263
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:04,701
Provocation, more likely.

264
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,142
I'm obliged.

265
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:08,539
Okay!

266
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,212
Stand aside.

267
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,283
See how I'll beat these out-of-towners!

268
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,477
Not here. Stand over there.

269
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:19,483
What about it?

270
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:21,618
Wait and see!

271
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,536
Very good!

272
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:22,345
Where's your master?

273
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,212
Here!

274
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,532
You wanna hack me to death?

275
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:22,579
Our master is not here.

276
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:56,445
The weather is so treacherous 
in Fo Shan these days.

277
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:00,607
Let me...

278
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,019
What are you drawing, Zhun?

279
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:16,968
He's ignoring you. 
Spend more time with him.

280
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:19,863
Okay.

281
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,376
So early, Lin?

282
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:33,534
Yes.

283
00:22:33,634 --> 00:22:36,382
I'm not here to fight. Just a few words.

284
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:47,497
What's the matter?

285
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,459
Some out-of-towners 
are provoking all the clubs.

286
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,061
Their kung-fu is too good 
for all the masters.

287
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:55,838
Can you look into that if you can?

288
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:58,376
That good?

289
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,499
Yes.

290
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,678
I gotta go, Mrs. Ip.

291
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:54,648
Hang in there, Master Liu!

292
00:23:54,748 --> 00:23:55,859
We depend on you, Master Liu!

293
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,920
Damn it.

294
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:25,726
No one in Fo Shan 
knows martial arts at all.

295
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,629
I thought everyone 
was Wong Fei-hong here.

296
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:32,996
It turns out you are just bums.

297
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,130
You can't even fight, 
let alone defend yourselves.

298
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,933
Brothers, 
our efforts have not been wasted.

299
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:40,090
Nobody in Fo Shan knows martial arts,

300
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,941
so we'll be rich this time.

301
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,712
Brothers, let's keep it up.

302
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:49,183
We open a club here 
to show them our might.

303
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:51,882
We will be No.1 in Fo Shan!

304
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:56,073
You think you're good 
by beating a few nitwits.

305
00:24:56,173 --> 00:24:57,890
Wait till you beat the best.

306
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:01,826
Who's the best in Fo Shan?

307
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:03,264
Ip Man, of course!

308
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:11,972
Go!

309
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:13,541
Come with us!

310
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:15,777
See how we shall defeat Ip Man.

311
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:42,166
Dad, there're lots of people outside.

312
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:45,240
How can I help you?

313
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:50,937
Sir... they...

314
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,209
Are you Ip Man?

315
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:56,534
I'm Jin. Heard that Fo Shan's 
famous for kung-fu.

316
00:25:56,634 --> 00:25:58,248
I understand, Master Jin. 
I understand.

317
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:01,285
You bring a crowd here 
to challenge me to a duel?

318
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:02,660
Of course.

319
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:06,194
We're opening a club 
here to show our might.

320
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:07,698
To open a martial club...

321
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:10,995
you need a good site.
No need to fight with me.

322
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:12,898
Please leave!

323
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:19,335
Uncle Wang, take Zhun inside.

324
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:20,909
Ip Man!

325
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,807
Don't dillydally. Are you scared?

326
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,888
You think our house is a martial club?

327
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,889
Who's going to fight with you? Get lost!

328
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:35,219
You heard that. I won't fight with you.

329
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,022
Please leave immediately.

330
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,363
I heard Wing Chun 
was invented by a woman.

331
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,593
That suits you just right.

332
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:45,368
Are you afraid of your wife, Ip?

333
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:48,736
No men are afraid of their wives.

334
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,074
There are only men who respect their wives.

335
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:56,008
Don't worry, Mrs. Ip.
I won't beat him to death.

336
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,348
If you fear he'll lose, 
I'll use only one hand.

337
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:04,846
If that's not enough, 
I can use no hands at all.

338
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:08,315
Fight with him, Master Ip! Beat him up!

339
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,242
I'm too disappointed by Fo Shan. Damn it!

340
00:27:11,342 --> 00:27:12,342
So many martial artists 
but none of them good.

341
00:27:12,442 --> 00:27:13,260
Shut up!

342
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:18,202
Don't break my things.

343
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,341
Get out of my way!

344
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,001
You rascals.

345
00:27:37,101 --> 00:27:38,135
You come at the right time.

346
00:27:38,235 --> 00:27:41,351
This place is too small.
Please get outside...

347
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,854
and close the door on your way out.

348
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,656
You have to redeem our honor.

349
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,133
Ask them to leave. Hurry up!

350
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,191
Can I just watch?

351
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:00,141
Get out!

352
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:04,445
Hurry up! Get out!

353
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,775
Get out! Get out!

354
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:18,760
Wing Chun, Ip Man.

355
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,060
I really wanna see...

356
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:26,099
how a man can fight like a woman.

357
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:32,366
Good kung-fu does not
depend on age or sex

358
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,707
but on how well you fight. 
You will know later.

359
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:14,815
I'll pay!

360
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:17,187
Good!

361
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,004
I'll pay!

362
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:45,331
Dad, Mom said if you 
don't start fighting,

363
00:29:45,431 --> 00:29:47,441
everything in the house will be broken.

364
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:48,950
Okay.

365
00:29:52,556 --> 00:29:53,853
Little brat.

366
00:29:54,258 --> 00:29:55,589
Watch your language.

367
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:34,381
Bro...

368
00:30:34,481 --> 00:30:35,659
Bro...

369
00:30:41,238 --> 00:30:43,433
You all right, Master Jin?

370
00:30:44,241 --> 00:30:45,230
I'm fine!

371
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,419
How about that, Master Jin?

372
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:16,429
My kung-fu isn't too bad, eh?

373
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:17,556
That's enough.

374
00:32:19,136 --> 00:32:22,401
My northern boxing has 
lost to your southern one.

375
00:32:24,174 --> 00:32:26,608
No, it's not a matter of 
northern or southern style.

376
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:28,403
The problem is you.

377
00:32:36,353 --> 00:32:37,479
So who won?

378
00:32:38,422 --> 00:32:41,687
Look how depressed he is. 
He must have lost.

379
00:32:42,726 --> 00:32:45,456
Get lost! Go back to your hometown!

380
00:32:46,363 --> 00:32:47,591
Get lost, you out-of-towners!

381
00:32:51,068 --> 00:32:52,797
Master! 
You fought very well, Ip!

382
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:56,130
You've redeemed the 
honor of our martial clubs.

383
00:32:56,273 --> 00:32:57,399
I was just lucky...

384
00:32:57,508 --> 00:33:00,170
Don't be modest. 
You are Canton's treasure!

385
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:05,733
Thank you.

386
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:07,647
Take a look. It's imported.

387
00:33:07,751 --> 00:33:09,343
- Master Ip, flowers for your wife.
- Thanks

388
00:33:09,553 --> 00:33:10,747
How much, boss?

389
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:12,135
On the house, Master Ip.

390
00:33:12,235 --> 00:33:14,122
I can't let you pay. 
You saved our honor.

391
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,486
How can that be?

392
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:16,725
You're running a business.

393
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,059
Don't stand on ceremonies. 
Next time then.

394
00:33:18,362 --> 00:33:19,294
Okay, next time

395
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:20,697
Fruits, Master Ip.

396
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:22,732
- You're too kind. I can't... 
- For the kid.

397
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,191
Thank you. 
Please come again. Goodbye.

398
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:26,599
Buddy.

399
00:33:27,104 --> 00:33:28,353
- Say thank you.
- Take this.

400
00:33:28,453 --> 00:33:30,464
- Thank you.
- You're welcome... Farewell.

401
00:33:31,141 --> 00:33:32,092
How are you, Master Ip?

402
00:33:32,192 --> 00:33:33,059
How are you?

403
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:34,075
How are you, Master Ip?

404
00:33:34,411 --> 00:33:35,343
That isn't bad at all.

405
00:33:35,579 --> 00:33:37,740
Yes, this is the best in our shop.

406
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:38,982
Really?

407
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,334
It's our honor if it can 
be placed in your house.

408
00:33:42,434 --> 00:33:43,443
Thank you.

409
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,414
What's the occasion?

410
00:33:47,157 --> 00:33:48,351
Uncle Man. Auntie.

411
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:50,855
So you plan on opening a martial club.

412
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,852
Why didn't you inform me first?

413
00:33:53,263 --> 00:33:55,094
When did I say that?

414
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,833
Everybody in Fo Shan knows about it.

415
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:59,328
Everybody in Fo Shan but me.

416
00:34:00,504 --> 00:34:02,233
Let me help you, Uncle Man.

417
00:34:03,707 --> 00:34:08,542
Please accept me as 
your disciple, Master Ip.

418
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:10,580
Master. 
Madam.

419
00:34:11,148 --> 00:34:11,632
Bro.

420
00:34:11,732 --> 00:34:13,445
You must be the one spreading the rumor.

421
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,345
Keep order for me.

422
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:18,555
Come. Go yourself.

423
00:34:20,524 --> 00:34:23,516
I don't care. 
Yao has to be your first disciple.

424
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:26,254
Come on. You've known me long enough.

425
00:34:26,463 --> 00:34:27,725
I don't like having disciples.

426
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:29,526
Be quiet.

427
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,166
Stay in order.

428
00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:35,730
Stay in order and hail: 
Master Ip! Master Ip...

429
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:51,619
Master Ip! Master Ip...

430
00:34:59,463 --> 00:35:02,796
On July 7, 1937, the Marco Polo Incident
broke out. Japan invaded China,

431
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,693
robbing its people
of their livelihood

432
00:35:03,694 --> 00:35:04,731
and causing rampant starvation
all over the country.

433
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,189
In October, 1938, Fo Shan 
was occupied by the Japanese army...

434
00:36:02,289 --> 00:36:04,727
...who destroyed factories,
infrastructures and buildings.

435
00:36:04,895 --> 00:36:09,491
The population of Fo Shan shrunk from
more than 300,000 to just over 70,000.

436
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,435
Only a dozen factories in the whole city
remained in operation.

437
00:36:22,412 --> 00:36:24,491
Ip's residence was also confiscated

438
00:36:24,492 --> 00:36:27,699
and turned into the headquarters
of the Japanese army.

439
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:31,652
Ip's family was rendered homeless,
living an abject existence.

440
00:37:32,082 --> 00:37:33,913
Cheng, I'll step out for a sec. 
Will be right back.

441
00:37:34,985 --> 00:37:36,418
Wait.

442
00:37:50,233 --> 00:37:52,201
It's cold outside. Wear a Jacket.

443
00:37:53,637 --> 00:37:56,105
Hurry up. Me this side, you that side.

444
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:06,976
Be careful, Zhun. Don't hurt others.

445
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,468
I'll give you more, Master Ip.

446
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:36,839
Thank you.

447
00:38:37,547 --> 00:38:39,708
Don't push! One by one.

448
00:38:40,717 --> 00:38:41,809
Don't push.

449
00:38:42,419 --> 00:38:43,750
One by one.

450
00:38:47,724 --> 00:38:48,884
You get out of the way!

451
00:39:05,942 --> 00:39:09,400
The mill may be old 
but it's still productive.

452
00:39:15,118 --> 00:39:16,551
Fo Shan is very chaotic these days.

453
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:19,122
You left already. Why did you come back?

454
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,049
Who's going to feed 
the workers otherwise?

455
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:24,924
All my money is invested in this mill.

456
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:27,725
I can't pay you back for now.

457
00:39:28,932 --> 00:39:31,992
Don't worry. I almost forgot.

458
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,834
No, I'll consider you a shareholder then.

459
00:39:35,038 --> 00:39:36,005
Let me calculate...

460
00:39:37,741 --> 00:39:39,174
you should have ten percent shares.

461
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:40,701
It's really not necessary.

462
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:44,005
Stay and help me out, 
now that you own it too.

463
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:47,207
Uncle Ip.

464
00:39:47,851 --> 00:39:48,651
Yao.

465
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,209
You'll be helping out? That's great!

466
00:39:50,487 --> 00:39:52,216
Everyone will be lively 
under your leadership.

467
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,648
And I can watch you practice Wing Chun.

468
00:39:55,058 --> 00:39:57,925
Ip, stay for lunch. 
It's lunchtime for the workers.

469
00:39:58,862 --> 00:40:00,056
Yes, let's have lunch together.

470
00:40:00,897 --> 00:40:01,795
No, thanks.

471
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:05,226
I can't. Next time.

472
00:40:05,702 --> 00:40:06,691
Goodbye.

473
00:40:17,647 --> 00:40:19,774
Dad, why didn't you 
ask Uncle Ip to stay?

474
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:22,742
He doesn't like to owe people favors-

475
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:33,646
Dad, you used to 
practice martial arts, right?

476
00:40:33,746 --> 00:40:35,664
Why did you stop?

477
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:38,232
I get hungry when I exercise.

478
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,533
So I need to exercise less, okay?

479
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:44,600
Got it. I won't play outside from now on.

480
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:48,625
You'll only stop playing today. Go eat.

481
00:40:48,725 --> 00:40:49,644
Hurry up and eat.

482
00:40:59,122 --> 00:41:00,783
This congee is a bit too thick.

483
00:41:02,592 --> 00:41:03,820
But you need to eat some.

484
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:11,890
Be careful, it's hot.

485
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,568
How much rice is left at home?

486
00:41:22,779 --> 00:41:23,803
Don't worry.

487
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,847
I've pawned everything worth pawning.

488
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:38,889
I am strong. I can look for a job.

489
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:40,163
It's not the end of the world.

490
00:41:41,965 --> 00:41:43,227
You look for a job?

491
00:41:44,234 --> 00:41:47,897
I didn't need to work. 
But it's different now.

492
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:50,170
There's always a first time.

493
00:41:54,244 --> 00:41:56,041
We have enough people here.

494
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,814
We don't need to hire more. Sorry.

495
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,719
Boss, are you hiring?

496
00:42:03,887 --> 00:42:04,979
No.

497
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:06,189
Thank you.

498
00:42:08,124 --> 00:42:12,220
You want to hire me, Boss...

499
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:13,694
Boss...

500
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:16,328
You, you, you... Come up here...

501
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:17,724
You want to hire me, Boss...

502
00:42:17,934 --> 00:42:19,128
Here.

503
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:24,740
You're looking for a job, Master Ip?

504
00:42:24,841 --> 00:42:25,899
Come, come up...

505
00:42:26,109 --> 00:42:27,701
Thank you.

506
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:56,771
Brother Ip!

507
00:43:04,681 --> 00:43:07,241
You can't dress like that to work.

508
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:09,883
I didn't expect to pour coals here.

509
00:43:10,954 --> 00:43:12,148
How are you, Master Ip?

510
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:14,414
How are you?

511
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:17,286
How are you, Master Ip?

512
00:43:21,097 --> 00:43:22,655
So many martial club masters here?

513
00:43:23,266 --> 00:43:26,064
The boss here used
to practice martial arts too.

514
00:43:26,202 --> 00:43:29,729
That's why he likes 
to employ martial artists.

515
00:43:30,206 --> 00:43:32,299
By the way, are you still practicing?

516
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:36,672
I'd rather use my 
time to scrape a living.

517
00:43:55,231 --> 00:43:57,961
I can't finish it all. Help me, okay?

518
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,197
Eat some.

519
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:08,776
How're your wife and son?

520
00:44:09,746 --> 00:44:10,974
They're fine. Thank you.

521
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:15,915
Did you find your brother?

522
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:18,213
I couldn't locate him since he left.

523
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:19,717
Don't know if he's still alive.

524
00:44:21,491 --> 00:44:23,186
I didn't even have 
the chance to say I'm sorry.

525
00:44:31,167 --> 00:44:32,225
What have you lost?

526
00:44:32,435 --> 00:44:34,232
I lost an iron box.

527
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:35,438
What iron box?

528
00:44:36,506 --> 00:44:37,495
Japanese solders are coming!

529
00:44:57,894 --> 00:44:58,952
Dear workers,

530
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:01,456
this is Colonel Sato.

531
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:04,865
He appreciates Chinese martial arts.

532
00:45:05,268 --> 00:45:07,293
He knows Fo Shan is 
famous for martial arts.

533
00:45:08,171 --> 00:45:11,937
He wants to find Chinese martial 
artists to fight with the Japanese.

534
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:14,301
Would anyone want to go?

535
00:45:15,211 --> 00:45:16,143
Would anyone want to go?

536
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:21,779
Would anyone want to go?

537
00:45:28,825 --> 00:45:29,625
Master?

538
00:45:34,397 --> 00:45:36,422
You want us to be sandbags?

539
00:45:36,566 --> 00:45:38,830
There's no door, I tell you!

540
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:41,494
Airhead.

541
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:44,238
Whoever wins will 
get one sack of rice.

542
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:50,872
Whoever wins will 
get one sack of rice

543
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:52,174
I'll do it!

544
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:54,142
Lin...

545
00:45:54,851 --> 00:45:55,875
Don't get into trouble.

546
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,145
I'm going too! Me too!

547
00:45:59,222 --> 00:46:01,972
They took all our rice. 
Now I can get them back.

548
00:46:02,072 --> 00:46:03,548
The world is fair.

549
00:46:07,997 --> 00:46:08,964
Forget it.

550
00:46:09,899 --> 00:46:10,923
Help me find the iron box.

551
00:46:15,371 --> 00:46:17,236
Let's go. It's okay. Come.

552
00:46:18,341 --> 00:46:19,205
Be careful.

553
00:46:19,342 --> 00:46:20,570
Come, let's line up.

554
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:21,968
Come, come, come...

555
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,379
Anything else?

556
00:46:25,548 --> 00:46:27,880
- No, let's go.
- Yes!

557
00:46:56,946 --> 00:46:58,004
Master?

558
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:01,248
General.

559
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,074
Thank you, General!

560
00:47:44,694 --> 00:47:46,161
Got to beat them all.

561
00:47:51,167 --> 00:47:53,601
Let me join in the fun.

562
00:47:55,705 --> 00:47:58,970
They're not good enough 
for General Miura.

563
00:48:00,109 --> 00:48:02,600
I'll show the Chinese what 
Japanese kung-fu's like.

564
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:07,474
Find three men to fight with me.

565
00:48:08,451 --> 00:48:11,420
Give them rice even if they lose.

566
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:13,389
Yes, sir!

567
00:48:16,392 --> 00:48:18,189
I've done you a favor again.

568
00:48:18,494 --> 00:48:21,588
General Miura will fight 
with three of you.

569
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:25,966
You can get rice whether you win or not.

570
00:48:26,102 --> 00:48:28,468
The rice is not important. 
I just wanna beat them.

571
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,303
Who will be going?

572
00:48:30,473 --> 00:48:31,997
I will...

573
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:34,109
Let go of me... Stop shouting!

574
00:48:35,278 --> 00:48:36,973
Lin, you and you... 
The three of you.

575
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:37,980
Okay!

576
00:49:37,106 --> 00:49:39,074
You've spit blood. 
Stop fighting.

577
00:49:40,743 --> 00:49:41,607
We've lost.

578
00:49:41,711 --> 00:49:45,408
General, they admitted defeat.

579
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:13,106
Your really wanna die?

580
00:50:17,847 --> 00:50:19,781
You asshole!

581
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,595
Lin, how are you? Lin...

582
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,567
Lin...

583
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:55,341
Were you tired today?

584
00:50:56,819 --> 00:50:58,446
Pouring coal is not tiring at all.

585
00:51:04,827 --> 00:51:06,226
I saw Lin today.

586
00:51:06,429 --> 00:51:08,397
Really? How is he?

587
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:09,662
Not bad.

588
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:12,866
I didn't expect to see him again.

589
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:39,521
Master Li, Master Hong.

590
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:40,563
Master Ip.

591
00:51:40,663 --> 00:51:42,222
Did you see Lin?

592
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:44,299
Lin? No.

593
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:45,692
No, I didn't.

594
00:51:46,302 --> 00:51:47,394
Let's eat first.

595
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:06,717
Many of us received rice yesterday.

596
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:10,590
General Miura was very satisfied.
Anybody wants to go today?

597
00:52:13,629 --> 00:52:14,618
Anybody? Li...

598
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:16,392
Li...

599
00:52:16,799 --> 00:52:17,823
Where's Lin?

600
00:52:20,336 --> 00:52:21,394
Anybody wants to go?

601
00:52:21,504 --> 00:52:23,404
I'm asking you. Where's Lin?

602
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,270
I don't know.

603
00:52:25,908 --> 00:52:28,468
Of course you do. 
You took him away.

604
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:30,577
Anybody wants to go?

605
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:32,573
You'll get rice if you win.

606
00:52:32,715 --> 00:52:33,545
Me!

607
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:35,478
If Master Ip is going, I'll go too!

608
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:36,745
Me too!

609
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:38,853
I wanna have a good fight 
with the Japanese.

610
00:52:41,991 --> 00:52:43,571
Anything else I can do?

611
00:52:43,671 --> 00:52:45,251
No, you can go.

612
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:15,488
Thanks.

613
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:20,026
Can I fight three more people?

614
00:53:23,299 --> 00:53:25,733
He said he wanted to 
fight three more people.

615
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:41,037
That's it for me...

616
00:55:01,764 --> 00:55:02,924
Why did you open fire?

617
00:55:06,068 --> 00:55:08,468
Li! Why did you open fire?

618
00:55:09,805 --> 00:55:12,433
Li! Why did you open fire?

619
00:55:12,608 --> 00:55:14,803
Who let you open fire?

620
00:55:15,911 --> 00:55:21,941
He took the rice even though he's lost.

621
00:55:22,084 --> 00:55:24,882
so... I wanted to teach him a lesson.

622
00:55:29,558 --> 00:55:31,890
This place is for tournaments only.

623
00:55:41,437 --> 00:55:44,964
Never open fire here anymore.

624
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:48,004
Got it!

625
00:55:53,749 --> 00:55:56,946
Please calm down, General Miura.

626
00:55:57,887 --> 00:56:00,082
I'll arrange the next tournament for you.

627
00:56:03,492 --> 00:56:04,550
Continue!

628
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:20,634
Who else wants to fight?

629
00:56:20,843 --> 00:56:21,673
Me!

630
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,604
Li! Open the gate!

631
00:56:28,984 --> 00:56:30,781
Master... Open the gate!

632
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:36,147
Tell me, was Lin beaten to death?

633
00:56:40,629 --> 00:56:41,857
Open the gate.

634
00:56:42,131 --> 00:56:42,947
Master...

635
00:56:43,047 --> 00:56:43,862
Open the gate!

636
00:56:46,001 --> 00:56:47,628
Please open the gate.

637
00:57:02,818 --> 00:57:04,479
I wanna fight ten people!

638
00:57:05,187 --> 00:57:06,620
You crazy? Please don't.

639
00:57:06,722 --> 00:57:07,984
I wanna fight ten people!

640
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:18,259
He said he wanted to fight ten people.

641
00:57:26,275 --> 00:57:27,105
Ten?

642
00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:30,701
Yes

643
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:33,772
Let's see how good he is.

644
00:57:38,687 --> 00:57:39,551
Unit 5!

645
00:57:40,589 --> 00:57:42,989
Unit 1, Unit 3, Unit 5.

646
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:44,919
Start!

647
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:49,865
Be careful

648
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:26,855
Stay back!

649
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:49,008
Come back again.

650
01:00:50,245 --> 01:00:51,109
He wants you to come back again.

651
01:00:53,115 --> 01:00:54,742
I'm not here for the rice.

652
01:00:57,019 --> 01:00:59,419
He said... he would come back.

653
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:06,420
What's your name?

654
01:01:07,095 --> 01:01:08,062
He wants to know your name.

655
01:01:15,103 --> 01:01:17,230
I'm just a Chinese.

656
01:01:20,308 --> 01:01:22,742
His name is Ip Man.

657
01:01:55,443 --> 01:01:56,535
Be careful in the future.

658
01:01:57,979 --> 01:01:59,446
I don't know what Miura might do.

659
01:02:04,519 --> 01:02:05,349
Lackey!

660
01:02:07,122 --> 01:02:08,214
Why am I a lackey?

661
01:02:09,324 --> 01:02:12,885
Their deaths got nothing to do with me.
I'm just an interpreter.

662
01:02:13,461 --> 01:02:15,395
I need to scrape a living too!

663
01:02:16,164 --> 01:02:17,028
Scrape a living?

664
01:02:18,366 --> 01:02:21,062
You watch your countrymen get beaten 
to death. Where's your dignity?

665
01:02:25,507 --> 01:02:26,371
I don't have any.

666
01:02:27,108 --> 01:02:28,166
You do. You have lots of it.

667
01:02:29,144 --> 01:02:30,907
If you have the guts, go beat them up!

668
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:33,047
Beat as many as you can!

669
01:02:33,848 --> 01:02:36,339
I'm an interpreter, not a lackey...

670
01:02:37,152 --> 01:02:39,313
I'm a Chinese!

671
01:03:36,044 --> 01:03:37,068
I'm back.

672
01:03:37,278 --> 01:03:38,229
Daddy.

673
01:03:38,329 --> 01:03:39,280
You're back?

674
01:03:41,149 --> 01:03:42,138
Have you been good?

675
01:03:42,350 --> 01:03:43,150
Yes.

676
01:03:43,952 --> 01:03:44,752
Good boy.

677
01:03:48,156 --> 01:03:49,145
Are you tired today?

678
01:04:11,112 --> 01:04:12,204
Go wash your face first.

679
01:05:13,541 --> 01:05:14,974
You're so good.

680
01:05:24,118 --> 01:05:26,279
I realize today I'm useless.

681
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:33,391
I can't do anything.

682
01:05:38,566 --> 01:05:40,090
I practiced marital arts before.

683
01:05:43,071 --> 01:05:43,871
But so what?

684
01:05:50,678 --> 01:05:51,667
This world...

685
01:05:57,318 --> 01:05:58,615
is minuscule.

686
01:06:02,357 --> 01:06:03,585
I'm so useless.

687
01:06:06,361 --> 01:06:08,056
I don't care what the world is like.

688
01:06:09,264 --> 01:06:12,324
I only know I'm very happy now.

689
01:06:15,136 --> 01:06:18,594
As long as you, me, and Zhun...

690
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:23,101
can stay together, 
everything will be okay.

691
01:06:27,148 --> 01:06:28,775
It's essential for a 
family to stay together.

692
01:06:59,781 --> 01:07:02,249
Get off! Get off!

693
01:07:02,817 --> 01:07:04,444
Get off...

694
01:07:04,752 --> 01:07:06,481
Stand over there! On the side!

695
01:07:06,587 --> 01:07:07,611
Stand over there...

696
01:07:32,146 --> 01:07:34,171
Who's the boss? Come out!

697
01:07:38,753 --> 01:07:39,720
I am.

698
01:07:49,831 --> 01:07:53,232
I just took your goods. 
You can buy them back.

699
01:07:53,334 --> 01:07:54,528
Is that okay?

700
01:07:55,737 --> 01:07:56,669
I don't have money.

701
01:07:58,706 --> 01:08:00,196
Don't beat my dad anymore!

702
01:08:02,643 --> 01:08:03,610
Wing Chun?

703
01:08:08,816 --> 01:08:09,874
Damn it! Wing Chun?

704
01:08:10,184 --> 01:08:11,481
Don't beat him!

705
01:08:15,323 --> 01:08:16,123
Do you have money?

706
01:08:16,791 --> 01:08:17,442
I don't.

707
01:08:17,542 --> 01:08:18,342
Do you?

708
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:20,227
No...

709
01:08:20,327 --> 01:08:21,386
I'll keep beating you till you have!

710
01:08:29,303 --> 01:08:30,201
The goods haven't been sold...

711
01:08:31,506 --> 01:08:32,803
I don't have money.

712
01:08:37,645 --> 01:08:39,476
Uncle Ip! Uncle Ip...

713
01:08:39,947 --> 01:08:42,541
Please save my dad. 
He's almost beaten to death.

714
01:08:43,217 --> 01:08:44,017
What's the matter, Yao?

715
01:08:44,218 --> 01:08:44,669
Auntie.

716
01:08:44,769 --> 01:08:46,482
Let me go see what happens. 
It's okay.

717
01:08:56,497 --> 01:08:59,694
I'm very reasonable.

718
01:09:00,501 --> 01:09:01,900
It's fine if you don't have money now.

719
01:09:02,603 --> 01:09:04,434
I'll give you some time to raise it.

720
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:06,329
As for the goods, I'll keep them for now.

721
01:09:24,826 --> 01:09:25,850
Master Ip.

722
01:09:29,263 --> 01:09:30,389
Dad, are you okay?

723
01:09:30,832 --> 01:09:32,993
I'm fine. Go help Uncle Fu.

724
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:53,412
How can I help?

725
01:09:55,289 --> 01:09:58,019
I thought your martial 
arts were impractical.

726
01:09:58,726 --> 01:10:00,250
Now I know it's very useful.

727
01:10:01,696 --> 01:10:04,392
I should've learnt some 
martial arts from you.

728
01:10:04,699 --> 01:10:05,961
At least I can defend myself.

729
01:10:07,502 --> 01:10:10,369
Uncle Ip, 
please stay and teach us martial arts,

730
01:10:10,805 --> 01:10:13,433
so that we can defend ourselves.

731
01:10:14,942 --> 01:10:16,239
Master Ip.

732
01:10:17,311 --> 01:10:20,280
You're such an expert. Please teach us.

733
01:10:20,548 --> 01:10:24,450
Yes, Master Ip. Please teach us.

734
01:10:28,589 --> 01:10:29,715
I'm a businessman.

735
01:10:31,559 --> 01:10:32,890
I know nothing other 
than running a business.

736
01:10:33,828 --> 01:10:36,490
I can't protect them, but you can.

737
01:10:38,666 --> 01:10:40,998
In peaceful days, 
it's okay if you refused to teach.

738
01:10:42,036 --> 01:10:45,870
But in bad times now, 
shouldn't you do something?

739
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:50,809
Teaching martial arts is very costly.

740
01:10:51,913 --> 01:10:55,041
Are you paying their fees? 
You owe me again?

741
01:11:01,656 --> 01:11:04,056
Uncle Ip, I'll be your first disciple.

742
01:12:20,001 --> 01:12:21,662
Dad, I wanna be taller.

743
01:12:22,036 --> 01:12:23,401
Taller?

744
01:12:36,817 --> 01:12:38,682
Why hasn't Ip Man come back?

745
01:12:41,022 --> 01:12:45,015
I... I don't know...

746
01:12:46,427 --> 01:12:47,485
Find him.

747
01:12:49,697 --> 01:12:54,691
I don't know where he is.

748
01:12:54,869 --> 01:12:56,097
I don't know how to find him.

749
01:12:56,437 --> 01:12:57,768
How big is Fo Shan?

750
01:12:58,839 --> 01:13:00,101
How difficult can it be to find him?

751
01:13:02,610 --> 01:13:05,602
Fo Shan is indeed very big.

752
01:13:11,519 --> 01:13:12,319
No...

753
01:13:13,688 --> 01:13:14,620
Please don't...

754
01:13:18,826 --> 01:13:20,726
I really don't know where he is...

755
01:13:24,465 --> 01:13:25,955
Useless thing! Enough!

756
01:13:32,973 --> 01:13:33,803
Asshole!

757
01:13:34,208 --> 01:13:35,766
Paper, stone, scissors!

758
01:13:36,644 --> 01:13:38,475
You lost.
You colluded?

759
01:13:40,614 --> 01:13:41,740
Hide well.

760
01:13:43,517 --> 01:13:45,644
10, 9, 8, 7...

761
01:13:45,853 --> 01:13:46,683
Zhun.

762
01:13:47,722 --> 01:13:48,105
That way.

763
01:13:48,205 --> 01:13:50,089
3, 2, 1

764
01:13:50,858 --> 01:13:53,190
I'm coming. I'll find you guys

765
01:13:57,031 --> 01:13:57,831
Master.

766
01:13:58,099 --> 01:13:58,899
What're you here for?

767
01:14:01,502 --> 01:14:02,730
Miura wants you to go back and fight him.

768
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:07,007
Go away.

769
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:09,910
I can't.

770
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:26,560
Why not?

771
01:14:27,194 --> 01:14:28,889
Why not? What do you want?

772
01:14:30,698 --> 01:14:31,858
What do you want?

773
01:14:37,571 --> 01:14:38,697
How pretty!

774
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:00,360
Shit.

775
01:15:02,596 --> 01:15:04,894
Let's go. It's not safe here.

776
01:15:24,585 --> 01:15:26,018
Let's go, Cheng.

777
01:15:33,794 --> 01:15:34,658
Li.

778
01:15:53,647 --> 01:15:56,775
You're a piece of shit!

779
01:15:56,917 --> 01:15:59,302
How could you let Ip run away?

780
01:15:59,402 --> 01:16:01,081
I'm sorry...

781
01:16:02,756 --> 01:16:06,192
Even Colonel Sato could not stop him...

782
01:16:06,727 --> 01:16:13,724
I've tried my best already...

783
01:16:15,035 --> 01:16:15,952
Sorry.

784
01:16:16,052 --> 01:16:17,060
Shut up!

785
01:16:17,238 --> 01:16:20,105
Utterly useless!

786
01:16:21,876 --> 01:16:22,968
Tell them...

787
01:16:27,081 --> 01:16:28,412
to dig Ip out! This is an order.

788
01:16:29,817 --> 01:16:30,617
Yes, sir.

789
01:16:45,165 --> 01:16:45,965
Little Sis.

790
01:16:50,971 --> 01:16:52,404
Brother, eat something.

791
01:17:01,448 --> 01:17:02,248
How's the master?

792
01:17:02,850 --> 01:17:04,317
Okay. They are all fine.

793
01:17:11,158 --> 01:17:12,056
Master.

794
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:13,560
Coming...

795
01:17:17,264 --> 01:17:18,253
Madam.

796
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:21,192
See if it fits?

797
01:17:22,870 --> 01:17:24,997
So are you well adapted here?

798
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:26,840
Yes.

799
01:17:27,207 --> 01:17:28,333
That's good.

800
01:17:28,742 --> 01:17:29,970
I'll let you know when the meal is ready.

801
01:17:31,011 --> 01:17:31,841
Li...

802
01:17:35,950 --> 01:17:36,814
I'm fine.

803
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:40,211
I really don't know what to say.

804
01:17:42,389 --> 01:17:43,189
Thank you.

805
01:17:44,992 --> 01:17:45,792
It's okay.

806
01:18:09,183 --> 01:18:10,878
We better leave Fo Shan 
as soon as possible.

807
01:18:13,053 --> 01:18:14,520
Quan is trying to find a solution for us.

808
01:18:15,055 --> 01:18:15,987
Where shall we go?

809
01:18:16,757 --> 01:18:17,557
Hong Kong.

810
01:18:18,359 --> 01:18:20,384
In fact, it doesn't matter where.

811
01:18:25,466 --> 01:18:27,229
I still have some friends in Hong Kong.

812
01:18:29,403 --> 01:18:30,802
If something happens to me...

813
01:18:31,772 --> 01:18:32,830
What can happen to you?

814
01:18:34,174 --> 01:18:35,402
Nothing will happen to you.

815
01:18:40,214 --> 01:18:42,011
They are here again! Let's scram!

816
01:18:56,997 --> 01:18:59,158
They are here! They are here!

817
01:19:08,042 --> 01:19:10,067
Have zou got the money?

818
01:19:10,377 --> 01:19:11,935
We won't give you money!

819
01:19:13,981 --> 01:19:15,005
What did you say?

820
01:19:17,251 --> 01:19:19,515
I'm not afraid of you! 
You can't bully us!

821
01:19:21,221 --> 01:19:23,086
You want me to beat you up?

822
01:19:29,063 --> 01:19:31,258
Damn it! Whoever dares to resist...

823
01:19:31,999 --> 01:19:32,897
just beat him up!

824
01:20:21,081 --> 01:20:22,309
Stop it!

825
01:20:35,963 --> 01:20:37,225
No wonder they dare to resist.

826
01:20:38,298 --> 01:20:39,595
They've found a bodyguard.

827
01:20:40,501 --> 01:20:43,265
You spurned me for 
opening a club in Fo Shan.

828
01:20:45,072 --> 01:20:47,063
And today, you wanna mess with me again?

829
01:20:48,041 --> 01:20:50,305
You wanna chase me away?

830
01:20:51,011 --> 01:20:52,000
No one wants to chase you away.

831
01:20:52,312 --> 01:20:56,214
Ip, have you ever been hungry every day?

832
01:20:58,252 --> 01:21:00,243
Everybody is hungry nowadays.

833
01:21:02,022 --> 01:21:04,582
The first day I came to 
Fo Shan, I told myself...

834
01:21:06,126 --> 01:21:07,388
I would never be hungry again.

835
01:21:08,529 --> 01:21:10,019
I will never be hungry again!

836
01:21:10,464 --> 01:21:11,362
Keep beating!

837
01:21:19,606 --> 01:21:20,436
Beat them!

838
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:25,363
Yuan, why you still idling here? Go!

839
01:22:30,244 --> 01:22:31,176
Kill them!

840
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:34,669
Kill them!

841
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:47,658
Go.

842
01:22:48,095 --> 01:22:49,653
How can we get near him?

843
01:23:43,784 --> 01:23:44,842
Let's go!

844
01:23:48,555 --> 01:23:50,182
Master, you were so good!

845
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:00,824
Yuan.

846
01:24:04,371 --> 01:24:05,201
Stop there!

847
01:24:13,814 --> 01:24:15,213
You know what you're doing?

848
01:24:15,415 --> 01:24:17,178
I know. I'm a robber.

849
01:24:18,185 --> 01:24:19,413
You're robbing the Chinese.

850
01:24:19,686 --> 01:24:21,779
I'd rather be the bully than the bullied.

851
01:24:22,122 --> 01:24:23,180
I want everyone to be scared of me!

852
01:24:26,894 --> 01:24:29,158
Your brother asked me to give this...
Don't talk about him!

853
01:24:34,235 --> 01:24:35,395
You know your brother is dead?

854
01:24:36,437 --> 01:24:37,699
He's beaten to death by the Japanese.

855
01:24:45,479 --> 01:24:49,245
He looked for you everywhere 
but couldn't find you.

856
01:24:52,353 --> 01:24:56,221
Everyone needs to choose his own path.

857
01:26:07,361 --> 01:26:08,161
Master.

858
01:26:09,630 --> 01:26:12,347
That guy told Miura 
you're at the cotton mill.

859
01:26:12,447 --> 01:26:13,798
Don't go back, ok?

860
01:26:14,802 --> 01:26:17,270
I gotta go. 
Remember, don't go back.

861
01:26:44,598 --> 01:26:54,701
Scram! Hurry up!

862
01:26:56,510 --> 01:26:57,670
Where's Ip Man?

863
01:26:59,513 --> 01:27:01,344
Where's Ip Man? Tell me!

864
01:27:02,916 --> 01:27:04,577
Don't say a word.

865
01:27:07,454 --> 01:27:08,887
You, come here.

866
01:27:11,659 --> 01:27:13,024
Where's Ip Man?

867
01:27:13,861 --> 01:27:15,795
Tell me!

868
01:27:16,864 --> 01:27:18,456
I'm asking you!

869
01:27:18,699 --> 01:27:20,064
Hang in there. I'll figure something out.

870
01:27:21,568 --> 01:27:22,368
Speak!

871
01:27:22,436 --> 01:27:24,354
Speak! Speak up...

872
01:27:24,454 --> 01:27:27,430
I'm here! I'm Ip Man...

873
01:27:27,975 --> 01:27:29,602
I'm here... Li!

874
01:27:31,011 --> 01:27:32,501
Wait! Wait!

875
01:27:32,613 --> 01:27:34,410
Please wait!

876
01:27:34,515 --> 01:27:37,712
Li, tell Miura the workers are innocent.

877
01:27:38,419 --> 01:27:39,943
Ask Miura to release them.

878
01:27:40,054 --> 01:27:41,601
I told you not to come back. 
Why did you?

879
01:27:41,701 --> 01:27:42,621
Tell him!

880
01:27:42,823 --> 01:27:44,017
Shit!

881
01:27:48,429 --> 01:27:49,361
Sato!

882
01:27:52,966 --> 01:27:56,684
He dares to hit me... 
Can't we put him to death?

883
01:27:56,784 --> 01:27:57,998
I know what I'm doing.

884
01:27:58,839 --> 01:27:59,931
- Li. 
- Yes.

885
01:28:01,742 --> 01:28:06,076
Since the day you resisted 
the Japanese army,

886
01:28:06,413 --> 01:28:09,541
you've already been a dead man.

887
01:28:10,517 --> 01:28:15,477
But you're talented, 
you can be useful to us.

888
01:28:15,889 --> 01:28:25,389
So I'll give you one chance to be loyal
to the Japanese Emperor.

889
01:28:25,666 --> 01:28:29,534
Teach our army Chinese kung-fu.

890
01:28:30,571 --> 01:28:33,938
That way, we might still spare your life.

891
01:28:36,076 --> 01:28:39,477
He wanted you to teach 
the Japanese kung-fu.

892
01:28:41,682 --> 01:28:43,149
I won't teach the Japanese.

893
01:28:44,151 --> 01:28:48,019
You wanna see me fight? 
I'll fight with you.

894
01:28:55,963 --> 01:28:59,490
He said he would think about it.

895
01:28:59,633 --> 01:29:05,196
He wants to have a 
duel with General Miura.

896
01:29:07,641 --> 01:29:08,767
Take him away!

897
01:29:10,110 --> 01:29:11,008
Take him away!

898
01:29:17,718 --> 01:29:20,152
Quan, take my wife 
and kid away from Fo Shan.

899
01:29:22,022 --> 01:29:26,049
Master Ip...

900
01:29:31,031 --> 01:29:34,023
General, you really wanna fight with Ip?

901
01:29:34,601 --> 01:29:35,625
Of course.

902
01:29:36,170 --> 01:29:38,195
He's an expert.

903
01:29:38,839 --> 01:29:40,238
But he doesn't look like...

904
01:29:40,908 --> 01:29:43,741
he wants to teach the Imperial Army.

905
01:29:44,111 --> 01:29:47,603
He must have other motives 
trying to fight with you.

906
01:29:48,048 --> 01:29:51,745
General, don't fight with him.

907
01:29:52,519 --> 01:29:55,113
Let me simply shoot him dead.

908
01:29:59,693 --> 01:30:05,893
He challenges me to a fight...

909
01:30:07,768 --> 01:30:09,565
because he thinks he's better than me.

910
01:30:12,072 --> 01:30:13,903
If I refuse to accept the challenge...

911
01:30:20,214 --> 01:30:21,078
but shoot him instead...

912
01:30:26,854 --> 01:30:29,584
isn't that the same as admitting defeat?

913
01:30:30,190 --> 01:30:32,784
Fighting with a Chinese...

914
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:36,686
is not just a matter of 
personal honor for you.

915
01:30:37,030 --> 01:30:40,883
It has to do with the 
national honor of our Empire.

916
01:30:40,983 --> 01:30:43,095
Are you saying I will lose?

917
01:30:43,804 --> 01:30:46,898
I only fear for the worst.

918
01:30:47,107 --> 01:30:48,802
I will win for sure.

919
01:30:49,743 --> 01:30:51,938
I'll let the whole China know I've won.

920
01:30:52,913 --> 01:30:55,609
Yes! I understand!

921
01:31:32,152 --> 01:31:38,113
I want you to teach us 
instead of killing you,

922
01:31:39,593 --> 01:31:41,220
because I appreciate your talent.

923
01:31:41,328 --> 01:31:47,858
But I don't think Chinese kung-fu
is better than Japanese.

924
01:31:50,904 --> 01:31:53,896
We will fight in front of everybody.

925
01:31:54,608 --> 01:31:56,940
That's why we need a fair tournament.

926
01:31:58,812 --> 01:32:03,146
You invaded our country 
and killed our people.

927
01:32:07,321 --> 01:32:09,050
Stop being hypocritical.

928
01:32:12,993 --> 01:32:14,017
Excuse me.

929
01:32:31,044 --> 01:32:33,012
Let go of me! Let me go back! 
Let go of my mom...

930
01:32:33,113 --> 01:32:36,241
I promised Ip nothing 
would happen to you.

931
01:32:36,917 --> 01:32:38,077
It's too dangerous to go back.

932
01:32:45,292 --> 01:32:46,974
I heard the Japanese 
are fighting the Chinese.

933
01:32:47,074 --> 01:32:48,275
- Who's fighting? 
- Ip Man.

934
01:32:48,375 --> 01:32:50,057
Look, the whole place is sealed up now.

935
01:32:57,404 --> 01:32:58,336
In the past...

936
01:32:59,973 --> 01:33:01,964
I wished he could be with me every day.

937
01:33:03,977 --> 01:33:06,207
So I always complained 
about his practice.

938
01:33:08,915 --> 01:33:11,008
Every time he had a duel with someone...

939
01:33:12,252 --> 01:33:13,742
I would throw a tantrum.

940
01:33:16,890 --> 01:33:20,155
I never truly supported him

941
01:33:20,694 --> 01:33:22,685
doing what he liked.

942
01:33:24,064 --> 01:33:24,962
Now...

943
01:33:25,966 --> 01:33:29,026
This could be his last duel.

944
01:33:32,172 --> 01:33:34,936
I fear there won't be another chance.

945
01:33:35,909 --> 01:33:38,469
Why don't you give me this chance?

946
01:33:39,279 --> 01:33:40,803
Why?

947
01:33:49,156 --> 01:33:50,145
General Miura says...

948
01:33:51,858 --> 01:33:53,485
For the sake of Sino-Japanese 
cultural exchange,

949
01:33:54,261 --> 01:33:57,025
he is having a fair tournament 
with Master Ip today...

950
01:33:57,931 --> 01:34:01,025
to share their knowledge 
in a friendly manner,

951
01:34:01,935 --> 01:34:03,334
and to bring true peace 
between the two countries.

952
01:34:04,204 --> 01:34:06,365
Fair tournament? Is that possible?

953
01:34:08,442 --> 01:34:11,206
That traitor will surely 
be killed by the Japanese.

954
01:34:11,311 --> 01:34:12,778
That's right.

955
01:34:13,914 --> 01:34:15,074
Shut up!

956
01:34:21,188 --> 01:34:22,155
Here comes Master Ip!

957
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:37,436
General Miura talked about a tournament.

958
01:34:38,004 --> 01:34:39,528
But I don't give a damn!

959
01:34:40,140 --> 01:34:41,266
Listen up.

960
01:34:41,775 --> 01:34:45,836
If you win,

961
01:34:46,346 --> 01:34:49,247
I will kill you.

962
01:34:49,349 --> 01:34:50,232
Remember this!

963
01:34:50,332 --> 01:34:51,132
Yes!

964
01:34:54,054 --> 01:34:55,783
You better let Miura win later...

965
01:34:56,423 --> 01:34:57,981
or he won't let you live.

966
01:35:00,494 --> 01:35:02,052
It's more important to stay alive.

967
01:35:05,465 --> 01:35:07,433
Although martial arts 
involves armed forces,

968
01:35:08,268 --> 01:35:11,237
Chinese martial arts 
is Confucian in spirit.

969
01:35:11,972 --> 01:35:14,463
The virtue of martial arts
is benevolence.

970
01:35:15,275 --> 01:35:16,889
You Japanese will never
understand the principle...

971
01:35:16,890 --> 01:35:18,438
of treating other people
as you would yourselves.

972
01:35:19,446 --> 01:35:21,004
Because you abuse military power.

973
01:35:21,114 --> 01:35:23,048
You turned it into violence 
to oppress others.

974
01:35:24,217 --> 01:35:26,242
You don't deserve to learn 
Chinese martial arts.

975
01:38:57,297 --> 01:39:20,280
Ip Man! Ip Man!

976
01:41:43,563 --> 01:41:47,829
Ip Man refused to be subjugated 
by the Japanese army...

977
01:41:48,234 --> 01:41:53,501
...and used his fists to call forth
the unity of the Chinese people.

978
01:41:57,510 --> 01:42:00,741
Assisted by his good 
friend Zhou Qingquan,

979
01:42:00,947 --> 01:42:06,408
the wounded Ip Man successfully
fled Fo Shan with his wife and son.

980
01:42:12,325 --> 01:42:15,453
On August 15, 1945,

981
01:42:15,929 --> 01:42:19,681
Emperor Hirohito of Japan announced that
Japan would surrender unconditionally.

982
01:42:19,781 --> 01:42:25,466
The Chinese finally won and ended a war
that lasted eight long years.

983
01:42:28,708 --> 01:42:31,973
In 1949, the Grandmaster Ip Man
settled in Hong Kong.

984
01:42:32,579 --> 01:42:34,872
He started his first Wing Chun class

985
01:42:34,873 --> 01:42:37,846
at Kowloon Hotel's Staff
Association Headquarters,

986
01:42:37,984 --> 01:42:41,545
turning a new leaf in his life.

987
01:42:41,921 --> 01:42:44,981
In 1967, Grandmaster Ip Man started the
Wing Chun Athletic Association to foster...

988
01:42:45,391 --> 01:42:47,757
...the spirit of Wing Chun
with a group of like-minded enthusiasts,

989
01:42:47,860 --> 01:42:52,490
fulfilling the most cherished dream
of his later years.

990
01:42:54,601 --> 01:42:59,595
Until now, Wing Chun has become a world
renowned branch of Chinese martial arts.

991
01:42:59,939 --> 01:43:05,935
The lineage of Grandmaster Ip Man's
disciples has exceeded 2 million people.

992
01:43:06,746 --> 01:43:12,844
There are lots of talented people
among his disciples,

993
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:23,891
including the most illustrious
action star of all, Bruce Lee.
