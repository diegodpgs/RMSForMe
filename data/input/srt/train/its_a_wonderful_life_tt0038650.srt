1
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,903
I owe everything to George Bailey.

2
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,197
Help him, dear Father.

3
00:01:30,573 --> 00:01:33,617
Joseph, Jesus and Mary,

4
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:36,328
help my friend Mr. Bailey.

5
00:01:36,788 --> 00:01:39,414
Help my son George tonight.

6
00:01:40,249 --> 00:01:42,117
He never thinks about himself, God.

7
00:01:42,217 --> 00:01:43,952
That's why he's in trouble.

8
00:01:44,052 --> 00:01:45,212
George is a good guy.

9
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:47,623
Give him a break, God.

10
00:01:47,723 --> 00:01:49,833
I love him, dear Lord.

11
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:51,802
Watch over him tonight.

12
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:53,587
Please, God.

13
00:01:53,687 --> 00:01:55,964
Something's the matter with Daddy.

14
00:01:56,064 --> 00:01:58,350
Please bring Daddy back.

15
00:01:58,935 --> 00:02:00,469
Please bring Daddy home.

16
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:02,771
Watch over him tonight.

17
00:02:03,147 --> 00:02:05,440
Please bring Daddy back.

18
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,355
Hello, Joseph. Trouble?

19
00:02:11,455 --> 00:02:14,024
Looks like we'll have
to send someone down.

20
00:02:14,124 --> 00:02:17,194
A lot of people asking for help
for a man named George Bailey.

21
00:02:17,294 --> 00:02:18,821
George Bailey?

22
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:21,365
Yes. Tonight's his crucial night.
You're right.

23
00:02:21,465 --> 00:02:24,326
We'll have to send someone down
immediately. Whose turn is it?

24
00:02:24,426 --> 00:02:26,753
That's why I came to see you, sir.

25
00:02:26,963 --> 00:02:29,415
It's that clockmaker's turn again.

26
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:32,751
Oh, Clarence.
Hasn't got his wings yet, has he?

27
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:34,712
We've passed him up right along.

28
00:02:34,812 --> 00:02:38,257
Because, you know, sir,
he's got the IQ of a rabbit.

29
00:02:38,357 --> 00:02:41,802
Yes, but he's got
the faith of a child. Simple.

30
00:02:41,902 --> 00:02:43,937
Joseph, send for Clarence.

31
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:48,600
You sent for me, sir?

32
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,729
Yes, Clarence.
A man down on Earth needs our help.

33
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:53,397
Splendid. Is he sick?

34
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:55,691
No, worse. He's discouraged.

35
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,360
At exactly 10:45 p.m. Earth time,

36
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,487
that man will be thinking seriously

37
00:03:00,587 --> 00:03:02,531
of throwing away God's greatest gift.

38
00:03:02,631 --> 00:03:06,243
Oh, dear, dear, his life?
Then I've only an hour to dress.

39
00:03:06,343 --> 00:03:07,536
What are they wearing now?

40
00:03:07,636 --> 00:03:10,748
You will spend that hour
getting acquainted with George Bailey.

41
00:03:10,848 --> 00:03:13,834
Sir, if I should accomplish this mission,

42
00:03:13,934 --> 00:03:17,379
I mean, might I perhaps win my wings?

43
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,923
I've been waiting
for over 200 years now, sir,

44
00:03:20,023 --> 00:03:21,550
and people are beginning to talk.

45
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,093
What's that book you've got there?

46
00:03:23,193 --> 00:03:25,345
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.

47
00:03:25,445 --> 00:03:27,805
Clarence, you do a good job
with George Bailey

48
00:03:27,905 --> 00:03:29,223
and you'll get your wings.

49
00:03:29,323 --> 00:03:31,058
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.

50
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:33,895
Poor George. Sit down.

51
00:03:33,995 --> 00:03:35,104
Sit down? What are we...

52
00:03:35,204 --> 00:03:36,898
If you're going to help a man,

53
00:03:36,998 --> 00:03:39,317
you want to know something about him,
don't you?

54
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:40,902
Well, naturally, of course. I...

55
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:42,286
Now, keep your eyes open.

56
00:03:43,163 --> 00:03:44,280
See the town?

57
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,033
Where? I don't see a thing.

58
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:49,952
Oh, I forgot.
You haven't got your wings yet.

59
00:03:50,052 --> 00:03:53,005
Now, look, I'll help you out.
Concentrate.

60
00:03:53,715 --> 00:03:55,458
Begin to see something?

61
00:03:55,558 --> 00:03:58,260
Why, yes. This is amazing.

62
00:03:58,386 --> 00:04:00,922
If you ever get your wings,
you'll see all by yourself.

63
00:04:01,022 --> 00:04:02,757
Oh, wonderful.

64
00:04:02,857 --> 00:04:05,551
Yay! Yippee!

65
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:07,637
Okay, boys, let's go.

66
00:04:07,737 --> 00:04:09,388
Hey, who's that?

67
00:04:09,488 --> 00:04:11,307
That's your problem. George Bailey.

68
00:04:11,407 --> 00:04:12,475
A boy?

69
00:04:12,575 --> 00:04:15,603
That's him when he was 12
back in 1919.

70
00:04:15,703 --> 00:04:19,073
Something happens here
you'll have to remember later on.

71
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:21,484
Come on, Marty.

72
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:23,410
Let's go, Marty!

73
00:04:24,246 --> 00:04:25,746
Attaboy, Marty.

74
00:04:26,623 --> 00:04:28,241
Hee-haw!

75
00:04:28,341 --> 00:04:30,292
Let's go, Sam. Hee-haw, Sammy!

76
00:04:31,044 --> 00:04:35,498
Here comes the scare-baby,
my kid brother Harry Bailey.

77
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:37,299
I'm not scared.

78
00:04:38,426 --> 00:04:39,802
Come on, Harry.

79
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,838
Let's go, Harry!

80
00:04:41,938 --> 00:04:43,256
Come on, Harry!

81
00:04:43,356 --> 00:04:44,507
Come on, Harry!

82
00:04:44,607 --> 00:04:46,600
- Come on, Harry!
- Come on, Harry!

83
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:48,678
Help, George, help!

84
00:04:48,778 --> 00:04:49,895
Help!

85
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:53,482
Don't worry, Harry. I'm coming!

86
00:04:53,608 --> 00:04:55,860
- Help!
- Hang on, Harry!

87
00:04:56,027 --> 00:04:58,396
- Help.
- Make a chain, gang.

88
00:04:58,496 --> 00:05:00,990
George saved his brother's life that day,

89
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:04,785
but he caught a bad cold
which infected his left ear.

90
00:05:05,245 --> 00:05:07,405
Cost him his hearing in that ear.

91
00:05:07,505 --> 00:05:09,782
It was weeks
before he was able to go back

92
00:05:09,882 --> 00:05:13,252
to his after-school job
at old man Gower's drugstore.

93
00:05:14,004 --> 00:05:15,121
Mr. Potter.

94
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:17,498
Who's that, a king?

95
00:05:17,598 --> 00:05:19,500
That's Henry F. Potter,

96
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,970
the richest and meanest man
in the county.

97
00:05:27,141 --> 00:05:29,475
- Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

98
00:05:30,185 --> 00:05:31,895
Go to work, slave.

99
00:05:32,938 --> 00:05:35,106
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

100
00:05:36,525 --> 00:05:38,526
Wish I had a million dollars.

101
00:05:39,153 --> 00:05:40,403
Hot dog!

102
00:05:44,283 --> 00:05:46,192
It's me, Mr. Gower. George Bailey.

103
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:47,256
You're late.

104
00:05:47,356 --> 00:05:48,661
Yes, sir.

105
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:58,296
Hello, George.

106
00:05:58,631 --> 00:05:59,923
Hello, Mary.

107
00:06:00,466 --> 00:06:01,583
Hello, Violet.

108
00:06:01,683 --> 00:06:03,251
Two cents' worth of shoelaces?

109
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:04,669
She was here first.

110
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:06,588
I'm still thinking.

111
00:06:06,688 --> 00:06:07,756
Shoelaces?

112
00:06:07,856 --> 00:06:09,432
Please, Georgie.

113
00:06:09,934 --> 00:06:11,092
I like him.

114
00:06:11,192 --> 00:06:12,928
You like every boy.

115
00:06:13,028 --> 00:06:14,638
What's wrong with that?

116
00:06:14,738 --> 00:06:16,230
Here you are.

117
00:06:17,191 --> 00:06:18,266
Help me down?

118
00:06:18,366 --> 00:06:20,234
Help you down?

119
00:06:26,951 --> 00:06:28,777
Made up your mind yet?

120
00:06:28,877 --> 00:06:30,620
I'll take chocolate.

121
00:06:30,746 --> 00:06:33,414
- With coconuts?
- I don't like coconuts.

122
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:35,458
You don't like coconuts?

123
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:38,962
Say, brainless, don't you know
where coconuts come from?

124
00:06:39,588 --> 00:06:40,956
Lookit here.

125
00:06:41,056 --> 00:06:44,258
From Tahiti, the Fiji islands,
the Coral Sea.

126
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:47,796
A new magazine. I never saw it before.

127
00:06:47,896 --> 00:06:50,390
Of course you never.
Only us explorers can get it.

128
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,894
I've been nominated for membership
in the National Geographic Society.

129
00:06:56,397 --> 00:06:58,306
Is this the ear you can't hear on?

130
00:06:58,406 --> 00:07:02,143
George Bailey,
I'll love you till the day I die.

131
00:07:02,243 --> 00:07:05,146
I'm going out exploring someday.
You watch.

132
00:07:05,246 --> 00:07:08,483
And I'm gonna have a couple of harems
and maybe three or four wives.

133
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:09,826
Wait and see.

134
00:07:12,746 --> 00:07:16,199
- George. George!
- Yes, sir?

135
00:07:16,299 --> 00:07:18,751
You're not paid to be a canary.

136
00:07:19,086 --> 00:07:20,378
No, sir.

137
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:50,741
Mr. Gower, do you want something?
Anything?

138
00:07:50,908 --> 00:07:51,950
No.

139
00:07:52,618 --> 00:07:55,287
- Anything I can do back here?
- No.

140
00:07:55,788 --> 00:07:57,197
I'll get them, sir.

141
00:07:57,297 --> 00:08:00,083
Quick, take those capsules
over to Mrs. Blaine.

142
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,494
She's waiting for them.

143
00:08:02,594 --> 00:08:03,920
Yes, sir.

144
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:28,604
They have the diphtheria there,
haven't they, sir?

145
00:08:28,704 --> 00:08:29,780
Yeah.

146
00:08:30,156 --> 00:08:31,656
Is it a charge, sir?

147
00:08:31,908 --> 00:08:33,325
Yes, George.

148
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:34,985
Mr. Gower, I...

149
00:08:35,085 --> 00:08:37,496
- Oh, get going.
- Yes, sir.

150
00:09:03,981 --> 00:09:06,183
Avast there, Captain Cook.
Where you heading?

151
00:09:06,283 --> 00:09:08,727
- I've got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
- Some other time, George.

152
00:09:08,827 --> 00:09:10,604
- It's important.
- There's a squall in there.

153
00:09:10,704 --> 00:09:12,189
It's shaping up into a storm.

154
00:09:12,289 --> 00:09:14,399
- Uncle Billy, telephone.
- Who is it?

155
00:09:14,499 --> 00:09:16,743
- Bank examiner.
- Bank examiner?

156
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,029
I should have called him yesterday.

157
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:20,747
Switch it inside.

158
00:09:23,042 --> 00:09:24,451
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.

159
00:09:24,551 --> 00:09:26,370
Well, you're begging.
That's a whole lot worse.

160
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,246
All I'm asking for is 30 days more.

161
00:09:28,346 --> 00:09:29,622
- Pop.
- Just a minute, Son.

162
00:09:29,722 --> 00:09:32,383
Just 30 short days.
I'll dig up that $5,000 somehow.

163
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:33,876
- Shove me up, shove me up.
- Pop.

164
00:09:33,976 --> 00:09:35,795
- Just a minute.
- Have you put any real pressure

165
00:09:35,895 --> 00:09:38,297
on these people of yours
to pay those mortgages?

166
00:09:38,397 --> 00:09:40,716
Times are bad, Mr. Potter.
A lot of these people are out of work.

167
00:09:40,816 --> 00:09:41,884
Well, then, foreclose.

168
00:09:41,984 --> 00:09:43,636
I can't do that.
These families have children.

169
00:09:43,736 --> 00:09:45,263
- Pop.
- They're not my children.

170
00:09:45,363 --> 00:09:47,265
But they're somebody's children,
Mr. Potter.

171
00:09:47,365 --> 00:09:49,892
Are you running a business
or a charity ward?

172
00:09:49,992 --> 00:09:52,103
- Well, all right...
- Not with my money.

173
00:09:52,203 --> 00:09:54,772
Mr. Potter, what makes you
such a hard-skulled character?

174
00:09:54,872 --> 00:09:56,691
You have no family, no children.

175
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,651
You can't begin
to spend all the money you've got.

176
00:09:58,751 --> 00:10:01,988
I suppose I should give it
to miserable failures

177
00:10:02,088 --> 00:10:05,283
like you and that idiot brother of yours
to spend for me.

178
00:10:05,383 --> 00:10:06,576
He's not a failure!

179
00:10:06,676 --> 00:10:09,495
- You can't say that about my father.
- George, George. Quiet, George.

180
00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:10,913
You're not.
You're the biggest man in town...

181
00:10:11,013 --> 00:10:12,498
- Run along, run along.
- ...bigger than him,

182
00:10:12,598 --> 00:10:14,750
- bigger than everybody.
- Gives you an idea of the Baileys.

183
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,586
Don't let him say that about you, Pop.

184
00:10:16,686 --> 00:10:18,337
All right, Son. All right. Thanks.

185
00:10:18,437 --> 00:10:20,181
I'll talk to you tonight.

186
00:10:27,147 --> 00:10:28,514
What?

187
00:10:28,614 --> 00:10:31,942
Why, that medicine should have
been there an hour ago.

188
00:10:32,444 --> 00:10:34,987
It will be over in five minutes,
Mrs. Blaine.

189
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,194
Where's Mrs. Blaine's box of capsules?

190
00:10:41,294 --> 00:10:42,912
I... You...

191
00:10:43,705 --> 00:10:45,072
Didn't you hear what I said?

192
00:10:45,172 --> 00:10:46,240
Yes, sir. I...

193
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,834
What kind of tricks
are you playing anyway?

194
00:10:50,921 --> 00:10:53,581
Why didn't you deliver them right away?

195
00:10:53,681 --> 00:10:55,208
Don't you know that boy's very sick?

196
00:10:55,308 --> 00:10:56,751
You're hurting my sore ear.

197
00:10:56,851 --> 00:10:58,419
You lazy loafer.

198
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:00,421
Mr. Gower,
you don't know what you're doing.

199
00:11:00,521 --> 00:11:02,381
You put something wrong
in those capsules.

200
00:11:02,481 --> 00:11:03,716
I know you're unhappy.

201
00:11:03,816 --> 00:11:05,509
You got the telegram, and you're upset.

202
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:07,428
You put something bad
in those capsules.

203
00:11:07,528 --> 00:11:09,855
It wasn't your fault, Mr. Gower.

204
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,308
Just look and see what you did.

205
00:11:12,408 --> 00:11:14,977
The bottle you took the powder from,
it's poison.

206
00:11:15,077 --> 00:11:16,779
I tell you, it's poison.

207
00:11:16,988 --> 00:11:18,697
I know you feel bad.

208
00:11:23,787 --> 00:11:25,780
- Oh!
- Don't hurt my sore ear again!

209
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,908
- Don't hurt my sore ear again.
- Oh, no, no. Oh, George, George.

210
00:11:30,008 --> 00:11:32,827
Oh, Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone.

211
00:11:32,927 --> 00:11:34,287
I know how you're feeling.

212
00:11:34,387 --> 00:11:37,040
I won't ever tell a soul.
Hope to die, I won't.

213
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,008
Oh, George. George.

214
00:11:39,343 --> 00:11:41,920
An overnight bag.
Genuine English cowhide.

215
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,171
Combination lock.

216
00:11:43,271 --> 00:11:46,591
- Fitted up with brushes, combs...
- Nope, nope, nope, nope.

217
00:11:46,691 --> 00:11:48,685
Now, look, Joe. Now, look.

218
00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:51,312
I want a big one.

219
00:11:51,897 --> 00:11:53,139
What did you stop it for?

220
00:11:53,239 --> 00:11:56,476
I want you to take a good look
at that face.

221
00:11:56,576 --> 00:11:57,602
Who is it?

222
00:11:57,702 --> 00:11:58,770
George Bailey.

223
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,815
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears
slapped back by the druggist?

224
00:12:01,915 --> 00:12:03,199
That's the kid.

225
00:12:05,369 --> 00:12:07,279
It's a good face. I like it.

226
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:09,205
I like George Bailey.

227
00:12:09,707 --> 00:12:12,284
Tell me,
did he ever tell anyone about the pills?

228
00:12:12,384 --> 00:12:13,543
Not a soul.

229
00:12:13,836 --> 00:12:16,621
Did he ever marry the girl?
Did he ever go exploring?

230
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:18,464
Well, wait and see.

231
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:21,293
Big, see? I don't want one for one night.

232
00:12:21,393 --> 00:12:23,378
I want something for 1,001 nights

233
00:12:23,478 --> 00:12:27,966
with plenty of room here for labels
from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand.

234
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:29,175
Great big thing, about...

235
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:31,428
- I see. A flying carpet, huh?
- Yeah.

236
00:12:31,528 --> 00:12:33,930
I don't suppose you'd like
this old secondhand job, would you?

237
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,223
Now you're talking.

238
00:12:35,323 --> 00:12:38,184
Gee whiz, I could use that as a raft
in case the boat sunk.

239
00:12:38,284 --> 00:12:40,528
- How much this cost?
- No charge.

240
00:12:41,196 --> 00:12:43,315
That's my trick ear, Joe.
It sounded like you said "no charge."

241
00:12:43,415 --> 00:12:44,407
That's right.

242
00:12:45,743 --> 00:12:47,277
Well, what's my name doing on it?

243
00:12:47,377 --> 00:12:50,405
A little present from old man Gower.
Came down and picked it out himself.

244
00:12:50,505 --> 00:12:53,867
He did? What do you know about that?
My old boss. Isn't that nice?

245
00:12:53,967 --> 00:12:55,201
What boat are you sailing on?

246
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:56,828
I'm working across on a cattle boat.

247
00:12:56,928 --> 00:12:59,088
- A cattle boat?
- Okay, I like cows.

248
00:13:01,342 --> 00:13:03,293
Hello, Mr. Gower. How are you?

249
00:13:03,393 --> 00:13:05,837
Thanks ever so much for the baggage.
It's just exactly what I wanted.

250
00:13:05,937 --> 00:13:06,963
Forget it.

251
00:13:07,063 --> 00:13:09,632
- It's wonderful of you to think of me.
- Hope you enjoy it.

252
00:13:09,732 --> 00:13:11,509
I wish I had a million dollars.

253
00:13:11,609 --> 00:13:12,852
Hot dog!

254
00:13:13,562 --> 00:13:15,180
Avast there, Captain Cook!

255
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,515
- You got your sea legs yet?
- Parlez-vous français, mister?

256
00:13:17,615 --> 00:13:19,851
Hey, send us some of those
picture postcards, will you, George?

257
00:13:19,951 --> 00:13:21,686
Hey, George,
don't take any plug nickels.

258
00:13:21,786 --> 00:13:23,438
Hey, George, your suitcase is leaking.

259
00:13:23,538 --> 00:13:24,739
Hey, Ernie!

260
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:27,274
- Hi, Ernie. Hi, Bert.
- Hiya, George.

261
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:29,151
- George.
- Hey, I'm a rich tourist today.

262
00:13:29,251 --> 00:13:30,694
How about driving me home in style?

263
00:13:30,794 --> 00:13:32,446
- Hop in, Your Highness. Hop in.
- Yes, sir.

264
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:35,457
And for the carriage trade,
I put on my hat.

265
00:13:37,627 --> 00:13:39,244
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.

266
00:13:39,344 --> 00:13:40,537
Hello, Violet.

267
00:13:40,637 --> 00:13:42,915
Hey, you look good.
That's some dress you got on there.

268
00:13:43,015 --> 00:13:44,500
This old thing?

269
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,469
Why, I only wear it
when I don't care how I look.

270
00:14:02,652 --> 00:14:05,028
- How would you like to take...
- Yes.

271
00:14:06,447 --> 00:14:08,107
Want to come along, Bert?
We'll show you the town.

272
00:14:08,207 --> 00:14:09,274
No, thanks.

273
00:14:09,374 --> 00:14:12,661
I think I'll go home
and see what the wife's doing.

274
00:14:14,497 --> 00:14:15,831
Family man.

275
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:20,077
George, Harry,
you're shaking the house down.

276
00:14:20,177 --> 00:14:21,245
Stop it.

277
00:14:21,345 --> 00:14:23,956
Let them alone.
I wish I was up there with them.

278
00:14:24,056 --> 00:14:27,000
But Harry will tear his dinner suit.
George!

279
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,002
That's why all children should be girls.

280
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:32,764
Well, if they were all girls
there wouldn't be any... Oh, never mind.

281
00:14:33,015 --> 00:14:35,426
George, Harry,
come down to dinner this minute.

282
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:38,512
Everything's getting cold, and you know
how long we've been waiting for you.

283
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:40,355
- Okay, Ma.
- Okay, Ma.

284
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:43,692
- Ta-da!
- Ta-da!

285
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,780
- We got a present for you, Pop.
- There you are.

286
00:14:51,075 --> 00:14:52,659
Oh, you two idiots.

287
00:14:53,453 --> 00:14:54,695
George, sit down and have dinner.

288
00:14:54,795 --> 00:14:55,779
- Fine.
- I've eaten.

289
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:58,615
Well, aren't you gonna finish dressing
for your graduating party? Look at you!

290
00:14:58,715 --> 00:15:00,117
I don't care. It's George's tux.

291
00:15:00,217 --> 00:15:01,994
Annie, my sweet,
have you got those pies?

292
00:15:02,094 --> 00:15:04,288
If you lay a hand on me,
I'll hit you with this broom!

293
00:15:04,388 --> 00:15:07,583
Annie, I'm in love with you.
There's a moon out tonight.

294
00:15:07,683 --> 00:15:11,628
Boy, oh boy, oh boy! My last meal
in the old Bailey boarding house.

295
00:15:11,728 --> 00:15:13,630
Oh, my lands, my blood pressure.

296
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,091
Pop, can I have the car? I gotta
take over a lot of plates and things.

297
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:17,155
What plates?

298
00:15:17,255 --> 00:15:18,594
Mom, I'm chairman
of the Eats Committee.

299
00:15:18,694 --> 00:15:19,845
We only need a couple of dozen.

300
00:15:19,945 --> 00:15:23,307
Oh, no, you don't, Harry.
Now, not my best Haviland, no.

301
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:25,392
Oh, let him have the plates, Mother.

302
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:28,478
Hope you have a good trip, George.
Uncle Billy and I are gonna miss you.

303
00:15:28,578 --> 00:15:30,070
I'm gonna miss you, too, Pop.

304
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,481
What's the matter? You look tired.

305
00:15:31,581 --> 00:15:33,782
I had another tussle with Potter today.

306
00:15:34,075 --> 00:15:35,860
I thought when we put him
on the board of directors,

307
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,286
he'd ease up on us a little bit.

308
00:15:37,621 --> 00:15:40,239
What's eating that old
money-grubbing buzzard anyway?

309
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:43,242
He's a sick man, frustrated,
sick in his mind.

310
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,161
Sick in his soul, if he has one.

311
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:47,997
He hates everybody
that has anything that he can't have.

312
00:15:48,097 --> 00:15:49,749
He hates us mostly, I guess.

313
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:51,167
Gangway. Gangway.

314
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:52,710
- So long, Pop.
- So long.

315
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,795
- You got a match?
- Very funny, very funny.

316
00:15:54,895 --> 00:15:55,859
Put those things in the car,

317
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:58,174
and I'll get your tie and studs ready
for you. Now, hurry up.

318
00:15:58,274 --> 00:15:59,509
- Okay, Mom.
- Now, don't drop one of those.

319
00:15:59,609 --> 00:16:00,801
You coming later, George?

320
00:16:00,901 --> 00:16:02,178
What do you mean,
and be bored to death?

321
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:03,846
Couldn't want a better death.
Lots of pretty girls,

322
00:16:03,946 --> 00:16:05,348
and we're gonna use
that new floor tonight, too.

323
00:16:05,448 --> 00:16:07,099
- I hope it works.
- No gin tonight, Son.

324
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,392
Oh, Pop, just a little?

325
00:16:08,492 --> 00:16:10,319
No, Son. Not one drop.

326
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:13,022
Boys and girls and music.

327
00:16:13,122 --> 00:16:14,982
Why do they need gin?

328
00:16:15,082 --> 00:16:18,110
Did I act like that
when I graduated from high school?

329
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,370
Pretty much.

330
00:16:20,038 --> 00:16:22,532
You know, George, I wish
we could send Harry to college with you.

331
00:16:22,632 --> 00:16:25,201
Your mother and I talked it over
half the night.

332
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:27,161
We have that all figured out.

333
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:29,372
You see, Harry will take my job
at the Building and Loan,

334
00:16:29,472 --> 00:16:32,216
work there for four years, then he'll go.

335
00:16:32,634 --> 00:16:33,960
Pretty young for that job.

336
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,753
Well, no younger than I was.

337
00:16:35,853 --> 00:16:38,180
Well, you were born older, George.

338
00:16:39,224 --> 00:16:40,716
How's that?

339
00:16:40,816 --> 00:16:42,510
I said you were born older.

340
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,970
I suppose you've decided
what you want to do

341
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,354
when you get out of college.

342
00:16:45,647 --> 00:16:47,390
Well, you know
what I've always talked about,

343
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:50,893
build things, design new buildings,
plan modern cities.

344
00:16:50,993 --> 00:16:52,311
All that stuff I've been talking about.

345
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,188
Still after that first million
before you're 30?

346
00:16:54,288 --> 00:16:56,740
I'll settle for half that in cash.

347
00:16:57,242 --> 00:16:59,451
Of course, it's just a hope.

348
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:01,737
But you wouldn't consider coming back

349
00:17:01,837 --> 00:17:04,039
to the Building and Loan, would you?

350
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,293
Well, I... I...

351
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:12,748
Annie, why don't you draw up a chair?
Then you'd be more comfortable,

352
00:17:12,848 --> 00:17:14,667
and you could hear everything
that's going on.

353
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,211
I would if I thought
I'd hear anything worth listening to.

354
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,838
You would, eh?

355
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:21,132
I know it's soon to talk about it.

356
00:17:21,232 --> 00:17:23,809
No, now, Pop, I couldn't.

357
00:17:24,352 --> 00:17:26,804
I couldn't face being cooped up
for the rest of my life

358
00:17:26,904 --> 00:17:28,688
in a shabby little office.

359
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:33,151
I'm sorry, Pop. I didn't mean that, but I...

360
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:35,854
It's this business of nickels and dimes

361
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:38,106
and spending all your life
trying to figure out

362
00:17:38,206 --> 00:17:40,108
how to save three cents
on a length of pipe.

363
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:43,278
I'd go crazy. I want to do something big
and something important.

364
00:17:43,378 --> 00:17:46,281
You know, George,
I feel that, in a small way,

365
00:17:46,381 --> 00:17:48,283
we're doing something important,

366
00:17:48,383 --> 00:17:50,619
satisfying a fundamental urge.

367
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:54,956
It's deep in the race for a man to want
his own roof and walls and fireplace.

368
00:17:55,056 --> 00:17:57,000
And we're helping him get those things

369
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,752
in our shabby little office.

370
00:17:58,852 --> 00:18:02,513
I know, Pop. I know that.

371
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,641
I wish I felt that...

372
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:09,145
I've been hoarding pennies
like a miser here in order to...

373
00:18:09,563 --> 00:18:12,357
Most of my friends
have already finished college.

374
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:15,860
I just feel like if I didn't get away,
I'd bust.

375
00:18:17,404 --> 00:18:20,565
Yes, yes, you're right, Son.

376
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:22,359
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?

377
00:18:22,459 --> 00:18:23,985
This town is no place for any man

378
00:18:24,085 --> 00:18:26,363
unless he's willing to crawl to Potter.

379
00:18:26,463 --> 00:18:28,998
Now, you've got talent, Son. I've seen it.

380
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,960
You get yourself an education
and get out of here.

381
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:37,340
Pop, you want a shock?

382
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,968
I think you're a great guy.

383
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:46,800
- Why, did you hear that, Annie?
- I heard it.

384
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,811
It's about time
one of you lunkheads said it.

385
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,064
I'm gonna miss old Annie.

386
00:18:56,527 --> 00:18:59,688
Pop, I think I'll get dressed
and go over to Harry's party.

387
00:18:59,788 --> 00:19:01,406
Have a good time, Son.

388
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:07,620
Excuse me.

389
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:09,197
There you are.

390
00:19:09,297 --> 00:19:10,365
George, hello.

391
00:19:10,465 --> 00:19:11,658
You know my kid brother George.

392
00:19:11,758 --> 00:19:13,702
- I'm gonna put him through college.
- Hello, George.

393
00:19:13,802 --> 00:19:15,078
Hee-haw!

394
00:19:15,178 --> 00:19:16,538
Sam Wainwright.

395
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:18,206
How are you? When did you get here?

396
00:19:18,306 --> 00:19:20,375
This afternoon.
I thought I'd give the kids a treat.

397
00:19:20,475 --> 00:19:21,835
Old college graduate now.

398
00:19:21,935 --> 00:19:24,003
Yeah, old "Joe College" Wainwright
they call me.

399
00:19:24,103 --> 00:19:26,881
Well, freshman, looks like
you're gonna make it after all, huh?

400
00:19:26,981 --> 00:19:29,383
- Harry, you're the guy I want to see.
- Hello, Sam.

401
00:19:29,483 --> 00:19:31,510
- Coach has heard all about you.
- He has?

402
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,429
Yeah, he's followed every game,
and his mouth's watering.

403
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:35,681
He wants me to find out
if you're gonna come along with us.

404
00:19:35,781 --> 00:19:37,307
Well, I got to make some dough first.

405
00:19:37,407 --> 00:19:39,935
Well, you better make it fast.
We need great ends like you.

406
00:19:40,035 --> 00:19:41,687
Not broken down old guys like this one.

407
00:19:41,787 --> 00:19:42,904
Hee-haw!

408
00:19:43,322 --> 00:19:45,357
George, welcome back.

409
00:19:45,457 --> 00:19:47,067
Hello, Mr. Partridge, how are you?

410
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:49,361
Putting a pool under this floor was
a great idea.

411
00:19:49,461 --> 00:19:50,738
Saved us another building.

412
00:19:50,838 --> 00:19:52,698
Now, Harry, Sam, have a lot of fun.

413
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:55,584
There's lots of stuff here to eat
and drink. Lots of pretty girls around.

414
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:57,536
A third dance... A third...

415
00:19:57,636 --> 00:20:00,748
- Hello, Violet.
- Hello. What am I bid?

416
00:20:00,848 --> 00:20:01,999
George.

417
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:03,917
Marty! Well, it's old home week.

418
00:20:04,017 --> 00:20:06,086
- Marty!
- Sam, Harry, how are you?

419
00:20:06,186 --> 00:20:08,046
- Do me a favor, will you, George?
- What's that?

420
00:20:08,146 --> 00:20:10,549
- You remember my kid sister Mary.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

421
00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:12,926
"Mama wants you, Marty.
Mama wants you." Remember?

422
00:20:13,026 --> 00:20:14,344
Dance with her, will you?

423
00:20:14,444 --> 00:20:17,556
Oh, me? Well, I feel funny enough
already with all these kids.

424
00:20:17,656 --> 00:20:18,682
Come on, be a sport.

425
00:20:18,782 --> 00:20:22,102
Just dance with her one time, and you'll
give her the thrill of her life. Hey, Sis!

426
00:20:22,202 --> 00:20:23,687
Don't be long, Marty.

427
00:20:23,787 --> 00:20:25,481
I'm not being a wet nurse to a...

428
00:20:25,581 --> 00:20:27,566
The next thing I knew,
some guy came up and tripped me.

429
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,568
That's the reason why I came in fourth.

430
00:20:29,668 --> 00:20:32,362
If it hadn't been for that,
that race'd have been a cinch.

431
00:20:32,462 --> 00:20:35,407
I tried to find out who it was later,
but I couldn't find out.

432
00:20:35,507 --> 00:20:39,161
Nobody'd ever tell you whoever it was,
because they'd be scared.

433
00:20:39,261 --> 00:20:40,704
'Cause they know
what kind of a guy I am.

434
00:20:40,804 --> 00:20:42,915
You remember George. This is Mary.

435
00:20:43,015 --> 00:20:44,625
Well, I'll be seeing you.

436
00:20:44,725 --> 00:20:45,793
Well, well, well.

437
00:20:45,893 --> 00:20:48,595
Now to get back to my story, see?

438
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:53,050
Hey, this is my dance.

439
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,718
Why don't you stop annoying people?

440
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:56,937
Well, I'm sorry. Hey!

441
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:02,776
- Well, hello.
- Hello.

442
00:21:03,277 --> 00:21:05,437
You look at me as if you didn't know me.

443
00:21:05,537 --> 00:21:06,730
Well, I don't.

444
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,149
You've passed me on the street
almost every day.

445
00:21:09,249 --> 00:21:10,317
Me?

446
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:13,578
No. That was a little girl
named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.

447
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,415
Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh, yes!
The big Charleston contest!

448
00:21:19,627 --> 00:21:22,454
The prize, a genuine loving cup.

449
00:21:22,554 --> 00:21:25,332
Those not tapped by the judges
will remain on the floor.

450
00:21:25,432 --> 00:21:26,550
Let's go!

451
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,302
I'm not very good at this.

452
00:21:38,402 --> 00:21:39,971
Neither am I.

453
00:21:40,071 --> 00:21:41,939
Okay. What can we lose?

454
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,286
Hey, you're wonderful.

455
00:22:22,522 --> 00:22:25,024
What's the matter, Othello? Jealous?

456
00:22:26,818 --> 00:22:29,896
Did you know there's a swimming pool
under this floor?

457
00:22:29,996 --> 00:22:34,158
And did you know that button behind you
causes this floor to open up?

458
00:22:35,285 --> 00:22:38,571
And did you further know
that George Bailey

459
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:40,998
is dancing right over that crack?

460
00:22:42,542 --> 00:22:44,168
And I've got the key.

461
00:23:06,942 --> 00:23:09,443
Stand back, everybody! Stand back!

462
00:23:13,782 --> 00:23:16,325
They're cheering us. We must be good.

463
00:23:54,238 --> 00:23:55,689
Get out of there!

464
00:23:55,789 --> 00:23:57,323
What... Oh, well.

465
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,075
~ <i>Buffalo gals</i>
<i>can't you come out tonight?</i> ~

466
00:24:07,175 --> 00:24:08,493
~ <i>Can't you come out tonight?</i> ~

467
00:24:08,593 --> 00:24:09,953
~ <i>Can't you come out tonight?</i> ~

468
00:24:10,053 --> 00:24:12,547
~ <i>Buffalo gals, can't you come out tonight</i> ~

469
00:24:12,756 --> 00:24:16,426
~ <i>And dance</i> ~

470
00:24:16,802 --> 00:24:19,504
~ <i>By the light</i> ~

471
00:24:19,604 --> 00:24:24,422
~ <i>Of the moon</i> ~

472
00:24:24,643 --> 00:24:27,512
- Oh, hot dog. Just like an organ.
- Beautiful.

473
00:24:27,612 --> 00:24:29,764
I told Harry I thought
I'd be bored to death.

474
00:24:29,864 --> 00:24:32,100
You should have seen
the commotion in that locker room.

475
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,936
I had to knock down three people
to get this stuff we're wearing here.

476
00:24:35,036 --> 00:24:36,896
Let me hold that old wet dress of yours.

477
00:24:36,996 --> 00:24:38,648
Do I look as funny as you do?

478
00:24:38,748 --> 00:24:40,567
I guess I'm not quite the football type.

479
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:42,410
You look wonderful!

480
00:24:42,828 --> 00:24:44,154
You know, if it wasn't me talking,

481
00:24:44,254 --> 00:24:46,831
I'd say you were
the prettiest girl in town.

482
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:49,868
Well, why don't you say it?

483
00:24:49,968 --> 00:24:53,296
I don't know. Maybe I will say it.
How old are you anyway?

484
00:24:54,256 --> 00:24:55,415
Eighteen.

485
00:24:55,515 --> 00:24:59,010
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year
you were seventeen.

486
00:24:59,636 --> 00:25:01,046
Too young or too old?

487
00:25:01,146 --> 00:25:03,848
Oh, no, no. Just right. Your age fits you.

488
00:25:04,683 --> 00:25:07,385
Yes, sir, you look a little older
without your clothes on.

489
00:25:07,485 --> 00:25:10,847
I mean, without a dress you look older.

490
00:25:10,947 --> 00:25:13,858
I mean younger. You look... You just...

491
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,895
I'm on the thing here.

492
00:25:16,995 --> 00:25:18,897
Sir, my train, please.

493
00:25:18,997 --> 00:25:21,699
A pox upon me for a clumsy lout.

494
00:25:21,825 --> 00:25:25,036
Your caboose, milady.

495
00:25:25,954 --> 00:25:28,039
You may kiss my hand.

496
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,958
Hey.

497
00:25:34,003 --> 00:25:35,337
Hey, Mary.

498
00:25:36,214 --> 00:25:39,416
As I was lumberin' down the street

499
00:25:39,516 --> 00:25:41,927
Down the street, down the street

500
00:25:42,178 --> 00:25:44,588
Okay, then. I'll throw a rock
at the old Granville house.

501
00:25:44,688 --> 00:25:46,840
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.

502
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,842
No, you see, you make a wish
and then try and break some glass.

503
00:25:48,942 --> 00:25:50,552
And you got to be
a pretty good shot nowadays, too.

504
00:25:50,652 --> 00:25:53,522
Oh, no, George, don't.
It's full of romance, that old place.

505
00:25:53,898 --> 00:25:55,816
I'd like to live in it.

506
00:25:56,025 --> 00:25:57,017
In that place?

507
00:25:57,117 --> 00:25:59,436
I wouldn't live in it as a ghost.
Now, watch.

508
00:25:59,536 --> 00:26:02,155
Right in the second floor, there. See?

509
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:08,028
What did you wish, George?

510
00:26:08,128 --> 00:26:10,539
Not just one wish, a whole hatful.

511
00:26:10,706 --> 00:26:12,699
Mary, I know what
I'm gonna do tomorrow

512
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,410
and the next day and next year
and the year after that.

513
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:18,330
I'm shaking the dust
of this crummy little town off my feet,

514
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:20,165
and I'm gonna see the world!

515
00:26:20,265 --> 00:26:23,335
Italy, Greece, the Parthenon,
the Coliseum.

516
00:26:23,435 --> 00:26:26,088
Then I'm coming back here and go
to college to see what they know.

517
00:26:26,188 --> 00:26:27,798
And then I'm gonna build things.

518
00:26:27,898 --> 00:26:29,299
I'm gonna build airfields.

519
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:31,760
I'm gonna build skyscrapers
100 stories high.

520
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,229
I'm gonna build bridges a mile long.

521
00:26:34,605 --> 00:26:36,731
What, are you gonna throw a rock?

522
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,529
Hey, that's pretty good.

523
00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:45,198
What did you wish, Mary?

524
00:26:47,952 --> 00:26:50,154
Buffalo gals
can't you come out tonight?

525
00:26:50,254 --> 00:26:51,488
Can't you come out tonight?

526
00:26:51,588 --> 00:26:53,157
Can't you come out tonight?

527
00:26:53,257 --> 00:26:56,243
Buffalo gals, can't you come out tonight

528
00:26:56,343 --> 00:26:59,329
And

529
00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:03,458
Dance by the light of the moon?

530
00:27:03,558 --> 00:27:05,502
What did you wish
when you threw that rock?

531
00:27:05,602 --> 00:27:07,004
- Oh, no.
- Come on, tell me.

532
00:27:07,104 --> 00:27:08,672
If I told you, it might not come true.

533
00:27:08,772 --> 00:27:10,515
What is it you want, Mary?

534
00:27:10,892 --> 00:27:13,393
What do you want? You want the moon?

535
00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:17,014
Just say the word, and I'll throw a lasso
around it and pull it down.

536
00:27:17,114 --> 00:27:20,901
Hey, that's a pretty good idea.
I'll give you the moon, Mary.

537
00:27:21,068 --> 00:27:22,485
I'll take it.

538
00:27:22,945 --> 00:27:23,987
Then what?

539
00:27:24,447 --> 00:27:27,949
Well, then you could swallow it,
and it would all dissolve, see?

540
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:31,819
And the moonbeams would shoot out
of your fingers and your toes

541
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,954
and the ends of your hair.

542
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:38,000
- Am I talking too much?
- Yes!

543
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,287
Why don't you kiss her
instead of talking her to death?

544
00:27:41,387 --> 00:27:42,413
How's that?

545
00:27:42,513 --> 00:27:45,966
Why don't you kiss her
instead of talking her to death?

546
00:27:47,636 --> 00:27:49,212
You want me to kiss her, huh?

547
00:27:49,312 --> 00:27:52,681
Youth is wasted on the wrong people.

548
00:27:53,725 --> 00:27:57,094
Hey. Hey, hold on, hey, mister.
Come on back out here!

549
00:27:57,194 --> 00:28:01,440
I'll show you some kissing that'll put
hair back on your head. What are you...

550
00:28:08,782 --> 00:28:09,865
Mary?

551
00:28:21,002 --> 00:28:23,003
Okay, I give up. Where are you?

552
00:28:23,255 --> 00:28:26,215
Over here in the hydrangea bushes.

553
00:28:26,466 --> 00:28:28,801
Here you are. Catch.

554
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:32,304
Wait a minute. What am I doing?

555
00:28:36,518 --> 00:28:39,011
This is a very interesting situation.

556
00:28:39,111 --> 00:28:40,938
Please give me my robe.

557
00:28:42,816 --> 00:28:45,518
A man doesn't get in a situation
like this every day.

558
00:28:45,618 --> 00:28:47,603
I'd like to have my robe.

559
00:28:47,703 --> 00:28:49,230
Not in Bedford Falls, anyway.

560
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,532
- Ouch! Oh!
- Gesundheit.

561
00:28:52,492 --> 00:28:54,277
- George Bailey!
- This requires a little thought here.

562
00:28:54,377 --> 00:28:56,028
Give me my robe.

563
00:28:56,128 --> 00:28:58,531
I've read about things like this,
but I've never...

564
00:28:58,631 --> 00:29:01,784
Shame on you!
I'm gonna tell your mother on you.

565
00:29:01,884 --> 00:29:04,453
My mother's way up on the corner there.

566
00:29:04,553 --> 00:29:06,497
I'll call the police.

567
00:29:06,597 --> 00:29:09,375
They're way downtown.
They'd be on my side, too.

568
00:29:09,475 --> 00:29:11,343
Then I'm going to scream!

569
00:29:12,053 --> 00:29:13,846
Maybe I could sell tickets.

570
00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:18,050
Let's see. No, the point is

571
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,853
in order to get this robe... I've got it.

572
00:29:21,146 --> 00:29:22,805
I'll make a deal with you, Mary.

573
00:29:22,905 --> 00:29:25,232
George! George!

574
00:29:27,694 --> 00:29:29,978
George, come on home! Quick!

575
00:29:30,078 --> 00:29:32,488
- Your father's had a stroke.
- What?

576
00:29:32,906 --> 00:29:35,734
- Mary, Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
- Come on, George, let's hurry.

577
00:29:35,834 --> 00:29:36,901
- Did you get a doctor?
- Yes.

578
00:29:37,001 --> 00:29:38,828
Campbell's there now.

579
00:29:49,423 --> 00:29:51,041
I think that's all
we'll need you for, George.

580
00:29:51,141 --> 00:29:54,002
- I know you're anxious to make a train.
- I have a taxi waiting downstairs.

581
00:29:54,102 --> 00:29:56,880
I want the board to know
that George gave up his trip to Europe

582
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,716
to help straighten things out here
these past few months.

583
00:29:59,816 --> 00:30:01,676
Good luck to you at school, George.

584
00:30:01,776 --> 00:30:03,720
- Good luck, George.
- Goodbye, George.

585
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,431
And now we come to the real purpose
of this meeting,

586
00:30:06,531 --> 00:30:09,184
to appoint a successor
to our dear friend Peter Bailey.

587
00:30:09,284 --> 00:30:11,436
Mr. Chairman,
I'd like to get to my real purpose.

588
00:30:11,536 --> 00:30:13,730
- Wait just a minute now.
- Wait for what?

589
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:17,192
I claim this institution
is not necessary to this town.

590
00:30:17,292 --> 00:30:21,112
Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I make
a motion to dissolve this institution

591
00:30:21,212 --> 00:30:24,491
and turn its assets and liabilities
over to the receiver.

592
00:30:24,591 --> 00:30:26,534
Potter, you dirty, contemptible...
I'll wring his neck.

593
00:30:26,634 --> 00:30:27,619
George, did you hear
what that buzzard...

594
00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:28,745
Mr. Chairman.

595
00:30:28,845 --> 00:30:30,622
It's too soon after Peter Bailey's death

596
00:30:30,722 --> 00:30:33,041
to talk about chloroforming
the Building and Loan.

597
00:30:33,141 --> 00:30:35,543
Peter Bailey died three months ago.

598
00:30:35,643 --> 00:30:37,420
I second Mr. Potter's motion.

599
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,922
Very well. In that case,

600
00:30:39,022 --> 00:30:42,884
I'll ask the two executive officers
to withdraw. But before you go,

601
00:30:42,984 --> 00:30:46,096
I'm sure the whole board wishes
to express its deep sorrow

602
00:30:46,196 --> 00:30:48,390
- at the passing of Peter Bailey.
- Thank you very much.

603
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,392
It was his faith and devotion

604
00:30:50,492 --> 00:30:52,060
that are responsible
for this organization.

605
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,062
I'll go further than that.

606
00:30:54,162 --> 00:30:58,566
I'll say that to the public
Peter Bailey was the Building and Loan.

607
00:30:58,666 --> 00:31:00,860
That's fine, Potter, coming from you,

608
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,904
considering that you probably
drove him to his grave.

609
00:31:03,004 --> 00:31:05,824
Peter Bailey was not a businessman.

610
00:31:05,924 --> 00:31:07,367
That's what killed him.

611
00:31:07,467 --> 00:31:10,161
Oh, I don't mean any disrespect to him.
God rest his soul.

612
00:31:10,261 --> 00:31:13,714
He was a man of high ideals, so-called.

613
00:31:14,174 --> 00:31:18,052
But ideals without common sense
can ruin this town.

614
00:31:18,846 --> 00:31:21,631
Now, you take this loan here
to Ernie Bishop,

615
00:31:21,731 --> 00:31:25,051
you know,
that fellow that sits around all day

616
00:31:25,151 --> 00:31:27,929
on his brains in his taxi, you know.

617
00:31:28,029 --> 00:31:31,807
I happen to know
the bank turned down this loan.

618
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:33,600
But he comes here,

619
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:38,447
and we're building him
a house worth $5,000.

620
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:41,608
- Why?
- Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter.

621
00:31:41,708 --> 00:31:44,570
You have all the papers there.
His salary, insurance.

622
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,988
I can personally vouch for his character.

623
00:31:46,088 --> 00:31:47,998
- A friend of yours?
- Yes, sir.

624
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:52,327
You see, if you shoot pool
with some employee here,

625
00:31:52,427 --> 00:31:54,671
you can come and borrow money.

626
00:31:54,922 --> 00:31:56,832
What does that get us?

627
00:31:56,932 --> 00:31:59,793
A discontented, lazy rabble

628
00:31:59,893 --> 00:32:01,795
instead of a thrifty working class.

629
00:32:01,895 --> 00:32:05,674
And all because
a few starry-eyed dreamers

630
00:32:05,774 --> 00:32:08,969
like Peter Bailey stir them up
and fill their heads

631
00:32:09,069 --> 00:32:11,305
with a lot of impossible ideas.

632
00:32:11,405 --> 00:32:13,182
Now, I say...

633
00:32:13,282 --> 00:32:16,143
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Now, hold on, Mr. Potter.

634
00:32:16,243 --> 00:32:19,480
You're right when you say my father
was no businessman. I know that.

635
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,191
Why he ever started this cheap
penny-ante Building and Loan

636
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:23,358
I'll never know.

637
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:26,320
But neither you nor anybody else
can say anything against his character,

638
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,113
because his whole life was...

639
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:30,824
Why, in the 25 years since he
and Uncle Billy started this thing,

640
00:32:30,924 --> 00:32:33,202
he never once thought of himself.
Isn't that right, Uncle Billy?

641
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:36,163
He didn't save enough money
to send Harry to school, let alone me.

642
00:32:36,263 --> 00:32:38,999
But he did help a few people
get out of your slums, Mr. Potter.

643
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:43,170
And what's wrong with that?
Why, here, you're all businessmen here.

644
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:46,507
Don't it make them better citizens, and
doesn't it make them better customers?

645
00:32:46,607 --> 00:32:48,800
You said that they...
What'd you say just a minute ago?

646
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,677
They had to wait and save their money

647
00:32:50,777 --> 00:32:52,221
before they even thought
of a decent home.

648
00:32:52,321 --> 00:32:54,014
Wait? Wait for what?

649
00:32:54,114 --> 00:32:55,766
Until their children grow up
and leave them?

650
00:32:55,866 --> 00:32:58,018
Until they're so old
and broken-down that they...

651
00:32:58,118 --> 00:33:00,729
Do you know how long it takes
a working man to save $5,000?

652
00:33:00,829 --> 00:33:04,191
Just remember this, Mr. Potter,
that this rabble you're talking about,

653
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:08,195
they do most of the working and paying
and living and dying in this community.

654
00:33:08,295 --> 00:33:10,739
Well, is it too much to have them work
and pay and live and die

655
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:12,616
in a couple of decent rooms and a bath?

656
00:33:12,716 --> 00:33:14,793
Anyway, my father didn't think so.

657
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:17,746
People were human beings to him,
but to you,

658
00:33:17,846 --> 00:33:20,799
a warped, frustrated old man,
they're cattle.

659
00:33:20,925 --> 00:33:23,377
Well, in my book, he died
a much richer man than you'll ever be.

660
00:33:23,477 --> 00:33:25,379
I'm not interested in your book.

661
00:33:25,479 --> 00:33:28,215
I'm talking about the Building and Loan.

662
00:33:28,315 --> 00:33:30,008
I know very well
what you're talking about.

663
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:32,385
You're talking about something
you can't get your fingers on,

664
00:33:32,485 --> 00:33:35,304
and it's galling you.
That's what you're talking about, I know.

665
00:33:35,404 --> 00:33:37,690
Well, I've said too much. I...

666
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:41,060
You're the Board here.
You do what you want with this thing.

667
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,728
There's just one thing more, though.

668
00:33:42,828 --> 00:33:45,439
This town needs
this measly one-horse institution

669
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:49,110
if only to have someplace where people
can come without crawling to Potter.

670
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:50,327
Come on, Uncle Billy.

671
00:33:56,376 --> 00:33:59,712
Sentimental hogwash. I want my motion.

672
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,417
Boy, oh boy, that was telling him,
George, old boy.

673
00:34:04,517 --> 00:34:06,294
You shut his big mouth.
You should have heard him.

674
00:34:06,394 --> 00:34:08,087
What happened?
We heard a lot of yelling.

675
00:34:08,187 --> 00:34:10,798
Well, we're being voted
out of business after 25 years.

676
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:14,385
- Easy come, easy go.
- Here it is. "Help wanted. Female."

677
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:16,429
You still want me
to hang around, George?

678
00:34:16,529 --> 00:34:19,056
- Yeah, I'll be right down.
- Yeah, hey, you'll miss your train.

679
00:34:19,156 --> 00:34:20,933
You're a week late for school already.
Go on.

680
00:34:21,033 --> 00:34:23,811
- What's going on in there?
- Never mind. Don't worry about that.

681
00:34:23,911 --> 00:34:26,939
They're putting us out of business.
So what? I can get another job.

682
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:28,774
- I'm only 55.
- 56.

683
00:34:28,874 --> 00:34:31,193
Go on, go on.
Hey, look, you gave up your boat trip,

684
00:34:31,293 --> 00:34:32,862
now you don't want to miss college,
too, do you?

685
00:34:32,962 --> 00:34:35,406
George! George!
They voted Potter down.

686
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,291
They want to keep it going.

687
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:39,827
You did it, George. You did it.

688
00:34:39,927 --> 00:34:42,121
They got one condition,
only one condition.

689
00:34:42,221 --> 00:34:43,789
- What's that?
- And that's the best part of it.

690
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:45,875
They've appointed George here
as Executive Secretary

691
00:34:45,975 --> 00:34:47,251
to take his father's place.

692
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:50,171
- Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy...
- You can keep him on. That's all right.

693
00:34:50,271 --> 00:34:52,173
As Secretary,
you can hire anyone you like.

694
00:34:52,273 --> 00:34:54,884
Dr. Campbell, now let's get
this thing straight. I'm leaving.

695
00:34:54,984 --> 00:34:56,594
I'm leaving right now.
I'm going to school.

696
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:59,138
This is my last chance.
Uncle Billy here, he's your man.

697
00:34:59,238 --> 00:35:02,066
But, George,
they'll vote with Potter otherwise.

698
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:06,904
- I know, I know, he didn't go.
- That's right.

699
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:10,316
Not only that, but he gave
his school money to his brother, Harry,

700
00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:11,901
and sent him to college.

701
00:35:12,001 --> 00:35:13,861
Harry became a football star.

702
00:35:13,961 --> 00:35:15,245
Made second team all-American.

703
00:35:15,664 --> 00:35:17,948
Yeah, but what happened to George?

704
00:35:18,048 --> 00:35:21,243
George got four years older,
waiting for Harry to come back

705
00:35:21,343 --> 00:35:23,412
and take over the Building and Loans.

706
00:35:23,512 --> 00:35:25,831
There are plenty of jobs around
for somebody that likes to travel.

707
00:35:25,931 --> 00:35:26,916
Look at this. Here.

708
00:35:27,016 --> 00:35:31,336
Venezuela oil fields. "Wanted,
man with construction experience."

709
00:35:31,436 --> 00:35:33,421
Here's the Yukon, right here.

710
00:35:33,521 --> 00:35:35,890
"Wanted,
man with engineering experience."

711
00:35:37,017 --> 00:35:38,843
There she blows.

712
00:35:38,943 --> 00:35:41,805
You know what the three most exciting
sounds in the world are?

713
00:35:41,905 --> 00:35:44,140
Breakfast is served.
Lunch is served. Dinner...

714
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,936
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains,
plane motors and train whistles.

715
00:35:48,036 --> 00:35:50,188
- Peanut?
- There's the professor now.

716
00:35:50,288 --> 00:35:52,565
Old Professor Phi Beta Kappa
all-American Bailey.

717
00:35:52,665 --> 00:35:54,693
Why, old George
"Geographic Explorer" Bailey.

718
00:35:54,793 --> 00:35:57,362
What? No husky dogs? No sled?
Uncle Billy, you haven't changed a bit.

719
00:35:57,462 --> 00:35:58,988
Nobody ever changes here,
you know that.

720
00:35:59,088 --> 00:36:00,740
Oh, am I glad to see you.

721
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,034
- Say, where's Mother?
- She's home, cooking the fatted calf.

722
00:36:03,134 --> 00:36:04,953
- Come on, let's go.
- Oh, wait! Wait, wait a minute.

723
00:36:05,053 --> 00:36:07,997
George, Uncle Billy,
I want you to meet Ruth.

724
00:36:08,097 --> 00:36:09,416
- Hello.
- How do you do?

725
00:36:09,516 --> 00:36:12,252
- Ruth Dakin.
- Ruth Dakin Bailey, if you don't mind.

726
00:36:12,352 --> 00:36:14,713
- Huh?
- Well, I wired you I had a surprise.

727
00:36:14,813 --> 00:36:16,423
Here she is. Meet the wife.

728
00:36:16,523 --> 00:36:19,350
Well, what do you know? A wife.

729
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:23,229
- Well, how do you do? Congratulations.
- How do you do?

730
00:36:23,564 --> 00:36:26,015
What am I doing? Congratulations!

731
00:36:26,115 --> 00:36:27,851
- Doggone it, Harry, you...
- They're married!

732
00:36:27,951 --> 00:36:30,061
Why don't you tell somebody?

733
00:36:30,161 --> 00:36:32,731
Come on, Mrs. Bailey,
I can't wait to see everybody's reaction.

734
00:36:32,831 --> 00:36:34,232
- You're really married?
- Why, yes.

735
00:36:34,332 --> 00:36:36,025
What's a pretty girl like you doing

736
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:38,069
marrying this two-headed brother
of mine?

737
00:36:38,169 --> 00:36:40,864
Well, I'll tell you. It's purely mercenary.
My father offered him a job.

738
00:36:40,964 --> 00:36:45,084
Oh, he got you and the job?
Well, Harry's cup runneth over.

739
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:49,756
George, about that job. Ruth spoke
out of turn. I never said I'd take it.

740
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:52,667
You've been holding the bag here
for four years, and,

741
00:36:52,767 --> 00:36:55,545
well, I won't let you down, George.
I would like to...

742
00:36:55,645 --> 00:36:58,757
Oh, wait a minute. I forgot the bags.
I'll be right back.

743
00:36:58,857 --> 00:37:00,049
It was a surprise to me.

744
00:37:00,149 --> 00:37:02,093
This is the new Mrs. Bailey,
my nephew's wife.

745
00:37:02,193 --> 00:37:05,972
- How are you?
- Old, old friend of the Baileys.

746
00:37:06,072 --> 00:37:09,192
Oh, really? What are their names?
Let's see...

747
00:37:09,651 --> 00:37:12,187
Oh, of course,
I've heard him speak of you.

748
00:37:12,287 --> 00:37:14,647
And I want to tell you,
we're gonna give the biggest party

749
00:37:14,747 --> 00:37:16,199
this town ever saw.

750
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:20,703
Here, have some popcorn.

751
00:37:22,122 --> 00:37:25,374
George, George, George.
That's all Harry ever talks about.

752
00:37:25,542 --> 00:37:27,710
Ruth, this...

753
00:37:27,836 --> 00:37:28,953
What about this job?

754
00:37:29,053 --> 00:37:31,455
Well, my father owns a glass factory
in Buffalo.

755
00:37:31,555 --> 00:37:34,291
He wants to get Harry started
in the research business.

756
00:37:34,391 --> 00:37:36,543
- Well, is it a good job?
- Oh, yes, very.

757
00:37:36,643 --> 00:37:39,296
Not much money,
but good future, you know.

758
00:37:39,396 --> 00:37:41,715
- Yeah.
- Harry's a genius at research.

759
00:37:41,815 --> 00:37:45,227
- My father just fell in love with him.
- And you did, too.

760
00:37:59,867 --> 00:38:00,859
Hey, Joe.

761
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:04,530
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
I feel so good.

762
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:09,292
I could spit in Potter's eye.
I think I will. I think I will.

763
00:38:10,086 --> 00:38:11,878
What did you say? Huh?

764
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,665
Maybe I'd better go home.

765
00:38:14,765 --> 00:38:17,092
Where's my hat? Where's my...

766
00:38:17,426 --> 00:38:21,004
- Oh, thank you, George. Which is mine?
- The middle one.

767
00:38:21,104 --> 00:38:24,174
Oh, thank you, George.
Oh boy, oh boy. Now, look,

768
00:38:24,274 --> 00:38:27,594
if you'll point me in the right direction...
Would you do that, George?

769
00:38:27,694 --> 00:38:28,846
Right down here.

770
00:38:28,946 --> 00:38:31,640
Old Building and Loan pal, huh?

771
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,017
Now you just turn this way
and then right straight down there.

772
00:38:34,117 --> 00:38:35,193
Oh, that way, huh?

773
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:40,574
~ <i>My wild Irish rose</i> ~

774
00:38:43,077 --> 00:38:46,196
I'm all right. I'm all right.

775
00:38:46,296 --> 00:38:51,126
~ <i>The sweetest flower I know</i> ~

776
00:39:28,664 --> 00:39:29,789
Hello, Ma.

777
00:39:31,958 --> 00:39:33,584
That's for nothing.

778
00:39:35,003 --> 00:39:37,538
- How do you like her?
- She's swell, isn't she?

779
00:39:37,638 --> 00:39:40,416
Looks like
she can keep Harry on his toes.

780
00:39:40,516 --> 00:39:42,843
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.

781
00:39:44,971 --> 00:39:47,765
Did you know that Mary Hatch
is back from school?

782
00:39:48,475 --> 00:39:50,517
Came back three days ago.

783
00:39:51,853 --> 00:39:53,687
Nice girl, Mary.

784
00:39:55,523 --> 00:39:58,359
Kind that'll help you
find the answers, George.

785
00:39:59,361 --> 00:40:00,903
Stop that grunting.

786
00:40:02,948 --> 00:40:06,359
Can you give me one good reason
why you shouldn't call on Mary?

787
00:40:06,459 --> 00:40:07,860
Sure. Sam Wainwright.

788
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,904
- Hee-haw?
- Yes, Sam's crazy about Mary.

789
00:40:10,004 --> 00:40:12,281
- Well, she's not crazy about him.
- Well, how do you know?

790
00:40:12,381 --> 00:40:14,116
- What, did she discuss it with you?
- No.

791
00:40:14,216 --> 00:40:16,953
- Well, then how do you know?
- Well, I've got eyes, haven't I?

792
00:40:17,053 --> 00:40:20,381
Why, she lights up like a firefly
whenever you're around.

793
00:40:21,633 --> 00:40:23,960
Besides,
Sam Wainwright's away in New York,

794
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:28,055
- and you're here in Bedford Falls.
- And all's fair in love and war.

795
00:40:28,473 --> 00:40:30,391
I don't know about war.

796
00:40:33,728 --> 00:40:37,473
Mother of mine, I can see right through
you right to your back-collar button.

797
00:40:37,573 --> 00:40:39,566
Trying to get rid of me, huh?

798
00:40:42,153 --> 00:40:44,655
Well, here's your hat.
What's your hurry?

799
00:40:45,657 --> 00:40:48,609
All right, Mother,
old Building and Loan pal,

800
00:40:48,709 --> 00:40:51,946
I think I'll go out and find a girl
and do a little passionate necking.

801
00:40:52,046 --> 00:40:53,239
Oh, George.

802
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:56,375
Now, if you'll just point me
in the right direction...

803
00:40:57,711 --> 00:40:59,044
This direction.

804
00:41:06,219 --> 00:41:07,928
Good night, Mrs. Bailey.

805
00:41:19,274 --> 00:41:21,976
- Excuse me.
- Now, wait a minute.

806
00:41:22,076 --> 00:41:24,186
I think I got a date.

807
00:41:24,286 --> 00:41:27,031
But stick around, fellows,
just in case, huh?

808
00:41:28,366 --> 00:41:30,117
We'll wait for you, baby.

809
00:41:31,995 --> 00:41:34,287
- Hello, Georgie Porgie!
- Hello Vi.

810
00:41:35,956 --> 00:41:37,540
- What gives?
- Nothing.

811
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:39,868
Where are you going?

812
00:41:39,968 --> 00:41:42,787
Oh, I'll probably end up
down at the library.

813
00:41:42,887 --> 00:41:47,258
Georgie, don't you ever get tired
of just reading about things?

814
00:41:48,385 --> 00:41:49,385
Yes.

815
00:41:50,262 --> 00:41:52,722
- What are you doing tonight?
- Not a thing.

816
00:41:53,307 --> 00:41:55,091
Are you game, Vi?
Let's make a night of it.

817
00:41:55,191 --> 00:41:57,393
I'd love it, Georgie. What'll we do?

818
00:41:57,561 --> 00:41:59,387
Let's go out in the fields
and take off our shoes

819
00:41:59,487 --> 00:42:01,890
- and walk through the grass.
- Huh?

820
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:04,893
Then we can go up to the falls.
It's beautiful up there in the moonlight,

821
00:42:04,993 --> 00:42:09,155
and there's a green pool up there,
and we can swim in it.

822
00:42:09,698 --> 00:42:12,984
Then we can climb Mount Bedford
and smell the pines

823
00:42:13,084 --> 00:42:14,736
and watch the sunrise
against the peaks,

824
00:42:14,836 --> 00:42:16,237
and we'll stay up there the whole night,

825
00:42:16,337 --> 00:42:18,573
and everybody'll be talking.
There'll be a terrific scandal.

826
00:42:18,673 --> 00:42:22,460
Georgie, have you gone crazy?
Why, walk in the grass in my bare feet?

827
00:42:23,337 --> 00:42:25,546
Why it's 10 miles up to Mount Bedford.

828
00:42:25,964 --> 00:42:30,009
- If you think...
- Okay, just forget about the whole thing.

829
00:42:47,653 --> 00:42:51,072
- What are you doing, picketing?
- Hello, Mary.

830
00:42:52,157 --> 00:42:54,242
I just happened to be passing by here.

831
00:42:54,368 --> 00:42:56,160
Yes, so I noticed.

832
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:59,072
- Have you made up your mind?
- How's that?

833
00:42:59,172 --> 00:43:01,783
- Have you made up your mind?
- About what?

834
00:43:01,883 --> 00:43:03,251
About coming in.

835
00:43:03,877 --> 00:43:05,912
Your mother just phoned
and said you were on your way over

836
00:43:06,012 --> 00:43:08,790
- to pay me a visit.
- My mother just called you?

837
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:10,250
Well, how did she know?

838
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:12,293
- Didn't you tell her?
- I didn't tell anybody.

839
00:43:12,393 --> 00:43:15,213
I just went for a walk
and happened to be passing by here.

840
00:43:15,313 --> 00:43:16,848
What do you...

841
00:43:18,684 --> 00:43:20,518
Went for a walk. That's all.

842
00:43:21,895 --> 00:43:24,772
- I'll be downstairs, Mother.
- All right, dear.

843
00:43:46,627 --> 00:43:48,920
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?

844
00:43:49,255 --> 00:43:51,506
Well, I'll come in for a minute.

845
00:43:53,551 --> 00:43:54,926
But I...

846
00:44:07,064 --> 00:44:10,108
I didn't tell anybody
I was coming over here, you know.

847
00:44:11,652 --> 00:44:14,404
- When did you get back?
- Tuesday.

848
00:44:15,573 --> 00:44:17,441
Where did you get that dress?

849
00:44:17,541 --> 00:44:20,118
- Do you like it?
- It's all right.

850
00:44:24,916 --> 00:44:26,366
I thought you would go back
to New York,

851
00:44:26,466 --> 00:44:28,793
like Sam and Angie
and the rest of them.

852
00:44:30,254 --> 00:44:33,790
I worked there a couple of vacations,
but I don't know.

853
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:35,250
I guess I was homesick.

854
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:38,345
Homesick? For Bedford Falls?

855
00:44:38,596 --> 00:44:41,640
Yes, and my family and...

856
00:44:42,808 --> 00:44:44,017
Everything.

857
00:44:45,353 --> 00:44:47,054
Would you like to sit down?

858
00:44:47,154 --> 00:44:48,980
All right, for a minute.

859
00:44:49,982 --> 00:44:51,725
I still can't understand it, though.

860
00:44:51,825 --> 00:44:53,936
You know, I didn't tell anybody
I was coming here.

861
00:44:54,036 --> 00:44:55,395
Would you rather leave?

862
00:44:55,495 --> 00:44:57,314
No. I don't want to be rude.

863
00:44:57,414 --> 00:44:58,949
Well, then, sit down.

864
00:44:59,158 --> 00:45:00,325
What's that?

865
00:45:03,371 --> 00:45:04,913
Some joke, huh?

866
00:45:10,002 --> 00:45:11,211
Well...

867
00:45:12,046 --> 00:45:15,465
I see it still smells like pine needles
around here.

868
00:45:16,175 --> 00:45:17,342
Thank you.

869
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,351
And dance by the

870
00:45:26,811 --> 00:45:28,186
What's the matter?

871
00:45:29,021 --> 00:45:31,106
Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah.

872
00:45:33,858 --> 00:45:35,101
Well...

873
00:45:35,201 --> 00:45:37,561
Nice about your brother Harry
and Ruth, isn't it?

874
00:45:37,661 --> 00:45:39,738
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's all right.

875
00:45:40,031 --> 00:45:41,148
Don't you like her?

876
00:45:41,248 --> 00:45:43,701
Well, of course I like her.
She's a peach.

877
00:45:44,869 --> 00:45:48,781
Oh, just marriage in general
you're not enthusiastic about, huh?

878
00:45:48,881 --> 00:45:53,411
No. Marriage is all right
for Harry and Marty and Sam and you.

879
00:45:53,511 --> 00:45:55,204
Mary! Mary!

880
00:45:55,304 --> 00:45:56,664
Who's down there with you?

881
00:45:56,764 --> 00:45:58,632
It's George Bailey, Mother.

882
00:45:58,842 --> 00:46:01,427
George Bailey? What's he want?

883
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,053
I don't know.

884
00:46:03,471 --> 00:46:04,847
What do you want?

885
00:46:06,057 --> 00:46:08,342
Me? Not a thing.

886
00:46:08,442 --> 00:46:10,477
I just came in to get warm.

887
00:46:12,981 --> 00:46:15,607
He's making violent love to me, Mother.

888
00:46:16,234 --> 00:46:19,395
You tell him to go right back home,
and don't you leave the house, either!

889
00:46:19,495 --> 00:46:22,606
Sam Wainwright promised to call you
from New York tonight.

890
00:46:22,706 --> 00:46:25,693
What's your mother mean?
You know, I didn't come here to...

891
00:46:25,793 --> 00:46:28,321
- What did you come here for, then?
- I don't know. You tell me.

892
00:46:28,421 --> 00:46:30,990
You're supposed to be the one
that has all the answers. You tell me.

893
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:32,950
- Why don't you go home?
- That's where I'm going.

894
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:34,660
I don't know why I came here
in the first place.

895
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,203
- Good night.
- Good night!

896
00:46:36,303 --> 00:46:39,332
Mary! Mary! The telephone. It's Sam.

897
00:46:39,432 --> 00:46:40,632
I'll get it.

898
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,510
Whatever were you doing
that you couldn't hear?

899
00:46:52,604 --> 00:46:54,855
Mary, he's waiting.

900
00:46:58,276 --> 00:46:59,401
Hello?

901
00:47:01,363 --> 00:47:02,696
Forgot my hat.

902
00:47:04,699 --> 00:47:07,902
Hee-haw! Hello, Sam, how are you?

903
00:47:08,002 --> 00:47:11,030
I'm great.
Gee, it's good to hear your voice again.

904
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:13,957
Well, that's awfully sweet of you, Sam.

905
00:47:14,876 --> 00:47:18,162
There's an old friend of yours here.
George Bailey.

906
00:47:18,262 --> 00:47:20,172
You mean old mossback George?

907
00:47:20,423 --> 00:47:22,875
Yes, old mossback George.

908
00:47:22,975 --> 00:47:24,877
Hee-haw! Put him on.

909
00:47:24,977 --> 00:47:27,254
Wait just a minute. I'll call him. George!

910
00:47:27,354 --> 00:47:29,548
He doesn't want to speak to George,
you idiot.

911
00:47:29,648 --> 00:47:31,475
He does so. He asked for him.

912
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:35,019
George, Sam wants to speak to you.

913
00:47:39,441 --> 00:47:40,433
Hi, Sam.

914
00:47:40,533 --> 00:47:44,354
Well, George Baileyoffski!
Hey, a fine pal you are.

915
00:47:44,454 --> 00:47:46,272
What're you trying to do, steal my girl?

916
00:47:46,372 --> 00:47:47,357
What do you mean?

917
00:47:47,457 --> 00:47:49,234
Nobody's trying to steal anybody's girl.

918
00:47:49,334 --> 00:47:51,236
Here... Here's Mary.

919
00:47:51,336 --> 00:47:53,696
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I want to talk to both of you.

920
00:47:53,796 --> 00:47:55,240
Tell Mary to get on the extension.

921
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:58,668
- Mother's on the extension. We...
- I am not!

922
00:47:58,961 --> 00:48:00,795
We can both hear. Come here.

923
00:48:01,672 --> 00:48:03,581
We're listening, Sam.

924
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:07,210
Well, look, I have a big deal coming up
that's gonna make us all rich.

925
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:09,879
George, do you remember
that night in Martini's bar

926
00:48:09,979 --> 00:48:13,633
when you told me you'd read someplace
about making plastics out of soybeans?

927
00:48:13,733 --> 00:48:15,885
- Chili beans.
- Shut up, will you?

928
00:48:15,985 --> 00:48:18,688
You remember, out of chili...
Out of soybeans.

929
00:48:20,524 --> 00:48:22,934
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Soybeans, yeah.

930
00:48:23,034 --> 00:48:25,353
Well, listen, Dad snapped up the idea,

931
00:48:25,453 --> 00:48:27,939
and he's gonna build
a factory outside of Rochester.

932
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:29,574
How do you like that?

933
00:48:31,285 --> 00:48:34,487
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?

934
00:48:34,587 --> 00:48:37,331
Well, why not?
Can you think of anything better?

935
00:48:37,791 --> 00:48:41,035
Well, I don't know.
Just why not right here?

936
00:48:41,135 --> 00:48:44,831
You remember that old tool
and machinery works?

937
00:48:44,931 --> 00:48:46,958
You tell your father
he can get that for a song.

938
00:48:47,058 --> 00:48:48,293
And all the labor he wants, too.

939
00:48:48,393 --> 00:48:50,837
Half the town was thrown out of work
when they closed down.

940
00:48:50,937 --> 00:48:53,214
That so? Well, I'll tell him.

941
00:48:53,314 --> 00:48:54,632
Hey, that sounds great.

942
00:48:54,732 --> 00:48:56,593
Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through.

943
00:48:56,693 --> 00:48:59,721
Now here's the point, Mary.
Mary, you're in on this, too.

944
00:48:59,821 --> 00:49:02,231
Now listen. Have you got any money?

945
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:06,936
Money? Yeah... Well, a little.

946
00:49:07,036 --> 00:49:08,000
Well, now, listen.

947
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:11,274
I want you to put every cent you've got
into our stock, do you hear?

948
00:49:11,374 --> 00:49:14,068
And, George, I may have a job for you,

949
00:49:14,168 --> 00:49:18,122
that is unless you're still married
to that broken-down Building and Loan.

950
00:49:18,749 --> 00:49:20,408
Well, this is the biggest thing
since radio,

951
00:49:20,508 --> 00:49:22,619
and I'm letting you in
on the ground floor.

952
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:24,754
Oh, Mary. Mary?

953
00:49:27,591 --> 00:49:28,674
I'm here.

954
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,002
Would you tell that guy

955
00:49:31,102 --> 00:49:33,171
I'm giving him the chance
of a lifetime, do you hear?

956
00:49:33,271 --> 00:49:35,096
The chance of a lifetime!

957
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:41,019
He says it's the chance of a lifetime.

958
00:49:44,524 --> 00:49:46,066
Now you listen to me.

959
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:49,269
I don't want any plastics,
and I don't want any ground floors.

960
00:49:49,369 --> 00:49:51,313
And I don't want to get married,
ever, to anyone.

961
00:49:51,413 --> 00:49:52,814
You understand that?

962
00:49:52,914 --> 00:49:54,858
I want to do what I want to do.

963
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:57,986
And you're... And you're...

964
00:49:58,086 --> 00:50:01,581
- Oh, Mary, Mary.
- George, George, George.

965
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:05,585
Oh, Mary.

966
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:10,715
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

967
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:13,552
Mary...

968
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:16,054
Here they come! Here they come!

969
00:50:41,414 --> 00:50:43,164
Goodbye, George!

970
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:47,836
Goodbye!

971
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:57,754
First Harry, now George.

972
00:50:57,854 --> 00:51:00,048
Annie, we're just two old maids now.

973
00:51:00,148 --> 00:51:02,267
You speak for yourself, Miss B.

974
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:08,315
If either of you two
see a stranger around here, it's me.

975
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:12,936
Hey, look.
There's somebody driving this cab.

976
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:14,855
Bert the cop sent this over.

977
00:51:14,955 --> 00:51:17,316
He said to float away
to Happyland on the bubbles.

978
00:51:17,416 --> 00:51:19,610
Oh, look at this. Old Bert. Champagne!

979
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:22,863
By the way, where are you two going
on this here now honeymoon?

980
00:51:22,963 --> 00:51:25,073
Where are we going? Look at this.

981
00:51:25,173 --> 00:51:27,534
There's the kitty, Ernie.
Here, come on, count it, Mary.

982
00:51:27,634 --> 00:51:29,703
I feel like a bootlegger's wife. Look.

983
00:51:29,803 --> 00:51:32,164
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna shoot the works.

984
00:51:32,264 --> 00:51:34,498
A whole week in New York.
A whole week in Bermuda.

985
00:51:34,598 --> 00:51:37,043
The highest hotels,
the oldest champagne,

986
00:51:37,143 --> 00:51:41,631
the richest caviar, the hottest music
and the prettiest wife.

987
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:43,966
That does it! Then what?

988
00:51:44,066 --> 00:51:47,061
- Then what, honey?
- After that, who cares?

989
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:49,521
That does it, come here. Come here.

990
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:54,226
Don't look now,
but there's something funny

991
00:51:54,326 --> 00:51:56,520
going on over there
at the bank, George.

992
00:51:56,620 --> 00:52:00,658
I've never really seen one, but that's got
all the earmarks of being a run.

993
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:11,160
Hey, Ernie, if you got any money
in the bank, you better hurry.

994
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:12,995
George, let's not stop. Let's go!

995
00:52:13,095 --> 00:52:14,588
Just a minute, dear.

996
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:21,178
- Please, let's not stop, George.
- I'll be back in a minute, Mary.

997
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:40,231
Well, hello, everybody.
Mrs. Thompson, how are you?

998
00:52:40,331 --> 00:52:43,158
Charlie? What's the matter here,
can't you get in?

999
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:02,761
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?

1000
00:53:03,012 --> 00:53:04,179
George.

1001
00:53:04,889 --> 00:53:08,892
Come on in, everybody.
That's right. Just come on in.

1002
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:10,394
Look out, you.

1003
00:53:12,605 --> 00:53:14,223
Now, look, why don't you all sit down?

1004
00:53:14,323 --> 00:53:16,483
There are a lot of seats over there.

1005
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:19,361
Just make yourselves at home.

1006
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:23,365
George, can I see you a minute?

1007
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:26,193
- Why didn't you call me?
- I just did, but they said you left.

1008
00:53:26,293 --> 00:53:27,862
This is a pickle, George.
This is a pickle.

1009
00:53:27,962 --> 00:53:29,488
All right, now, what happened?
How did it start?

1010
00:53:29,588 --> 00:53:30,698
How does a thing like this ever start?

1011
00:53:30,798 --> 00:53:32,450
- All I know is the bank called our loan.
- When?

1012
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:34,743
About an hour ago.
I handed over all our cash.

1013
00:53:34,843 --> 00:53:36,161
- All of it?
- Every cent of it,

1014
00:53:36,261 --> 00:53:38,621
- and still it was less than we owe them.
- Holy mackerel!

1015
00:53:38,721 --> 00:53:40,832
And then I got scared, George,
and closed the doors.

1016
00:53:40,932 --> 00:53:42,592
I... I...

1017
00:53:44,636 --> 00:53:46,379
The whole town's gone crazy.

1018
00:53:46,479 --> 00:53:47,805
Yeah, hello?

1019
00:53:47,973 --> 00:53:50,016
George, it's Potter.

1020
00:53:53,562 --> 00:53:54,637
Hello?

1021
00:53:54,737 --> 00:53:59,100
George, there is a rumor around town
that you've closed your doors.

1022
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,651
Is that true?

1023
00:54:01,028 --> 00:54:03,271
Oh, well, I'm very glad to hear that.

1024
00:54:03,371 --> 00:54:06,691
George, are you all right?
Do you need any police?

1025
00:54:06,791 --> 00:54:08,159
Police? What for?

1026
00:54:08,368 --> 00:54:12,205
Well, mobs get pretty ugly
sometimes, you know.

1027
00:54:12,498 --> 00:54:17,001
George, I'm going all out
to help in this crisis.

1028
00:54:17,294 --> 00:54:22,256
I've just guaranteed the bank
sufficient funds to meet their needs.

1029
00:54:22,591 --> 00:54:25,968
They'll close up for a week
and then reopen.

1030
00:54:26,845 --> 00:54:28,638
He just took over the bank.

1031
00:54:28,889 --> 00:54:30,507
I may lose a fortune,

1032
00:54:30,607 --> 00:54:34,469
but I'm willing
to guarantee your people, too.

1033
00:54:34,569 --> 00:54:37,013
Just tell them
to bring their shares over here,

1034
00:54:37,113 --> 00:54:39,682
and I will pay 50 cents on the dollar.

1035
00:54:39,782 --> 00:54:41,893
You never miss a trick, do you, Potter?

1036
00:54:41,993 --> 00:54:43,144
Well, you're gonna miss this one.

1037
00:54:43,244 --> 00:54:46,948
If you close your doors before 6:00 p.m.,
you will never reopen.

1038
00:54:55,749 --> 00:54:57,200
George, was it a nice wedding?

1039
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,293
Gosh, I wanted to be there.

1040
00:54:59,711 --> 00:55:00,753
Yeah.

1041
00:55:02,673 --> 00:55:04,590
You can take this one off now.

1042
00:55:13,433 --> 00:55:18,771
Now, just remember that this thing
isn't as black as it appeared.

1043
00:55:28,532 --> 00:55:30,358
I have some news for you, folks.

1044
00:55:30,458 --> 00:55:31,860
I was just talking to old man Potter,

1045
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,570
and he's guaranteed cash payments
at the bank.

1046
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:35,195
The bank's gonna reopen next week.

1047
00:55:35,295 --> 00:55:37,197
But, George, I got my money here.

1048
00:55:37,297 --> 00:55:38,866
Did he guarantee this place?

1049
00:55:38,966 --> 00:55:41,994
Well, no, Charlie. I didn't even ask him.
We don't need Potter over here.

1050
00:55:42,094 --> 00:55:43,795
Then, I'll take mine now.

1051
00:55:44,213 --> 00:55:45,797
No, but you're...

1052
00:55:46,632 --> 00:55:48,709
You're thinking of this place all wrong,

1053
00:55:48,809 --> 00:55:52,379
as if I had the money back in a safe.
The money's not here.

1054
00:55:52,479 --> 00:55:55,007
Well, your money's in Joe's house.
That's right next to yours.

1055
00:55:55,107 --> 00:55:57,342
And in the Kennedy house
and Mrs. Macklin's house

1056
00:55:57,442 --> 00:55:58,927
and 100 others.

1057
00:55:59,027 --> 00:56:00,596
Why, you're lending them
the money to build,

1058
00:56:00,696 --> 00:56:02,723
and then, they're gonna pay it back
to you as best they can.

1059
00:56:02,823 --> 00:56:04,474
Now, what are you gonna do,
foreclose on them?

1060
00:56:04,574 --> 00:56:10,614
I got $242 in here,
and $242 isn't going to break anybody.

1061
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:14,075
Okay, Tom. All right.

1062
00:56:14,327 --> 00:56:16,904
Here you are. You sign this.
You'll get your money in 60 days.

1063
00:56:17,004 --> 00:56:18,113
Sixty days?

1064
00:56:18,213 --> 00:56:20,240
Now, that's what you agreed to
when you bought your shares.

1065
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:22,451
- Tom! Tom, did you get your money?
- No.

1066
00:56:22,551 --> 00:56:23,577
Well, I did.

1067
00:56:23,677 --> 00:56:26,288
Old man Potter'll pay 50 cents
on the dollar for every share you've got.

1068
00:56:26,388 --> 00:56:28,957
- Fifty cents on the dollar!
- Yes, cash!

1069
00:56:29,057 --> 00:56:30,626
Well, what do you say?

1070
00:56:30,726 --> 00:56:33,337
Now, Tom, you have to stick
to your original agreement.

1071
00:56:33,437 --> 00:56:34,755
Now, give us 60 days on this.

1072
00:56:34,855 --> 00:56:36,924
- Okay, Randall.
- Are you going to go to Potter's?

1073
00:56:37,024 --> 00:56:39,092
Better to get half than nothing.

1074
00:56:39,192 --> 00:56:41,269
Tom! Tom!

1075
00:56:41,687 --> 00:56:43,521
Randall! Now, Randall, wait! Wait.

1076
00:56:43,898 --> 00:56:47,684
Now, listen. Now, listen to me.
I beg of you not to do this thing.

1077
00:56:47,784 --> 00:56:49,853
If Potter gets a hold
of this Building and Loan,

1078
00:56:49,953 --> 00:56:51,897
there'll never be
another decent house built in this town.

1079
00:56:51,997 --> 00:56:53,482
He's already got charge of the bank.

1080
00:56:53,582 --> 00:56:55,609
He's got the bus line.
He got the department stores.

1081
00:56:55,709 --> 00:56:58,445
And now he's after us. Why?
Well, it's very simple.

1082
00:56:58,545 --> 00:57:00,781
Because we're cutting in
on his business, that's why.

1083
00:57:00,881 --> 00:57:02,950
And because he wants
to keep you living in his slums

1084
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:04,952
and paying the kind of rent he decides.

1085
00:57:05,052 --> 00:57:06,954
Joe, you had one
of those Potter houses, didn't you?

1086
00:57:07,054 --> 00:57:08,038
Well, have you forgotten?

1087
00:57:08,138 --> 00:57:10,499
Have you forgotten what he charged you
for that broken-down shack?

1088
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:13,710
Here, Ed, you know. You remember last
year when things weren't going so well

1089
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:14,962
and you couldn't make your payments.

1090
00:57:15,062 --> 00:57:16,505
Well, you didn't lose your house,
did you?

1091
00:57:16,605 --> 00:57:18,340
You think Potter would've
let you keep it?

1092
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,134
Can't you understand
what's happening here?

1093
00:57:21,234 --> 00:57:22,803
Don't you see what's happening?

1094
00:57:22,903 --> 00:57:25,597
Potter isn't selling.
Potter's buying, and why?

1095
00:57:25,697 --> 00:57:27,849
Because we're panicky and he's not.
That's why.

1096
00:57:27,949 --> 00:57:29,142
He's picking up some bargain.

1097
00:57:29,242 --> 00:57:31,603
Now we can get through
this thing all right.

1098
00:57:31,703 --> 00:57:33,480
We've got to stick together, though.

1099
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,064
We've got to have faith in each other.

1100
00:57:35,164 --> 00:57:38,359
But my husband hasn't worked
in over a year, and I need money.

1101
00:57:38,459 --> 00:57:40,152
How am going to live
until the bank opens?

1102
00:57:40,252 --> 00:57:42,571
- I got doctor bills to pay.
- I need cash.

1103
00:57:42,671 --> 00:57:44,573
I can't feed my kids on faith.

1104
00:57:44,673 --> 00:57:46,325
How much do you need?

1105
00:57:46,425 --> 00:57:49,920
Hey! I got $2,000.

1106
00:57:50,547 --> 00:57:52,999
Here's $2,000.
This'll tide us over till the bank reopens.

1107
00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:55,876
- All right, Tom, how much do you need?
- $242.

1108
00:57:55,976 --> 00:57:58,504
Tom, just enough to tide you over
until the bank reopens.

1109
00:57:58,604 --> 00:58:00,764
I'll take $242.

1110
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,344
- There you are.
- That'll close my account.

1111
00:58:05,444 --> 00:58:07,722
Your account's still here. That's a loan.

1112
00:58:07,822 --> 00:58:11,183
- Okay. All right, Ed?
- I got $300 here, George.

1113
00:58:11,283 --> 00:58:14,854
Now, Ed, what'll it take
till the bank opens? What do you need?

1114
00:58:14,954 --> 00:58:17,273
Well, I suppose $20.

1115
00:58:17,373 --> 00:58:20,192
$20. Now you're talking.
Thanks, Ed. That's fine.

1116
00:58:20,292 --> 00:58:21,861
All right, now, Mrs. Thompson,
how much do you want?

1117
00:58:21,961 --> 00:58:23,237
But it's your own money, George.

1118
00:58:23,337 --> 00:58:25,031
Never mind about that.
How much do you want?

1119
00:58:25,131 --> 00:58:27,199
- I can get along with $20, all right.
- $20, fine.

1120
00:58:27,299 --> 00:58:29,410
- And I'll sign the paper.
- You don't have to sign anything.

1121
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:31,620
I know you. You pay it when you can.
That's okay.

1122
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:35,132
- All right, Mrs. Davis?
- Could I have $17.50?

1123
00:58:36,968 --> 00:58:40,337
Bless your heart. Of course
you can have it. You got 50 cents?

1124
00:58:40,437 --> 00:58:41,797
- Seven...
- We're gonna make it, George.

1125
00:58:41,897 --> 00:58:43,382


1126
00:58:43,482 --> 00:58:47,978
...five, four, three, two,

1127
00:58:48,146 --> 00:58:50,222
one, bingo!

1128
00:58:50,322 --> 00:58:51,932
We made it! Close the door, Eustace!
We made it.

1129
00:58:52,032 --> 00:58:54,935
Look, look, we're still in business.
We've still got 2 bucks left.

1130
00:58:55,035 --> 00:58:56,854
Look, let's have some of that.
Let's celebrate!

1131
00:58:56,954 --> 00:58:58,355
Get some glasses, Tilly.

1132
00:58:58,455 --> 00:59:01,692
- Well, a couple of financial wizards.
- Call us Rockefellers.

1133
00:59:01,792 --> 00:59:04,278
Get a tray for these two
great big important simoleons here.

1134
00:59:04,378 --> 00:59:05,905
We'll save them for seed. A toast.

1135
00:59:06,005 --> 00:59:09,450
A toast. A toast to Mama Dollar
and to Papa Dollar,

1136
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:11,660
and if you want to keep this old
Building and Loan in business,

1137
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,245
you better have a family real quick.

1138
00:59:13,345 --> 00:59:16,165
- I wish they were rabbits.
- I wish they were, too.

1139
00:59:16,265 --> 00:59:19,301
Okay, let's put them in the safe
and see what happens.

1140
00:59:26,726 --> 00:59:27,885
Close the door.

1141
00:59:27,985 --> 00:59:29,887
Folks, folks, wedding cigars.

1142
00:59:29,987 --> 00:59:33,390
Wedding. Holy mackerel, I'm married.

1143
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:36,101
Where's Mary? Mary! Poor...

1144
00:59:36,201 --> 00:59:38,353
Look, I got a train to catch.
Well, the train's gone.

1145
00:59:38,453 --> 00:59:40,814
I wonder if Ernie's still here
with his taxicab.

1146
00:59:40,914 --> 00:59:43,316
George, there's a call for you.

1147
00:59:43,416 --> 00:59:44,734
Look, will you get my wife
on the phone?

1148
00:59:44,834 --> 00:59:46,194
She's probably over at her mother's.

1149
00:59:46,294 --> 00:59:47,821
Mrs. Bailey is on the phone.

1150
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:49,948
I don't want Mrs. Bailey. I want my wife.

1151
00:59:50,048 --> 00:59:53,584
Mrs. Bailey! Oh, that's my wife.
Here, I'll take it in here.

1152
00:59:53,961 --> 00:59:57,046
Mary. Hello. Listen, dear, I'm sorry.

1153
00:59:57,464 --> 01:00:01,175
Huh? Come home? What home?

1154
01:00:01,927 --> 01:00:05,680
320 Sycamore? Well, what...
Whose home is that?

1155
01:00:06,515 --> 01:00:08,724
The Waldorf Hotel, huh?

1156
01:00:19,278 --> 01:00:22,313
Hey, this is the company's posters,
and the company won't like this.

1157
01:00:22,413 --> 01:00:24,399
How would you like
to get a ticket next week?

1158
01:00:24,499 --> 01:00:25,817
You got any romance in you?

1159
01:00:25,917 --> 01:00:28,486
- Sure, I had it, but I got rid of it.
- Liver pills.

1160
01:00:28,586 --> 01:00:31,072
Who wants to see liver pills
on their honeymoon?

1161
01:00:31,172 --> 01:00:33,575
What we want is romantic places,
beautiful places,

1162
01:00:33,675 --> 01:00:35,501
places George wants to go.

1163
01:00:36,837 --> 01:00:38,580
Hey, Bert. Here he comes.

1164
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:39,914
Come on, we got to get this up.
He's coming.

1165
01:00:40,014 --> 01:00:41,875
- Who?
- The groom, idiot.

1166
01:00:41,975 --> 01:00:43,835
This is their honeymoon.
Come on. Get that ladder.

1167
01:00:43,935 --> 01:00:45,469
What are they, ducks?

1168
01:00:48,265 --> 01:00:50,508
- Get that ladder up here.
- All right, all right.

1169
01:00:50,608 --> 01:00:53,436
- Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.
- I'm hurrying.

1170
01:01:02,487 --> 01:01:05,156
Hiya... Good evening, sir.

1171
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:09,068
Entree, Monsieur.

1172
01:01:10,643 --> 01:01:11,881
Entree.

1173
01:01:12,109 --> 01:01:17,819
~ <i>Islands of Hawaii</i> ~

1174
01:01:17,979 --> 01:01:27,184
~ <i>Where skies of blue are calling me</i> ~

1175
01:01:28,052 --> 01:01:37,462
~ <i>Where balmy air and golden moonlight</i> ~

1176
01:01:37,713 --> 01:01:47,260
~ <i>caress the waving palms of Waikiki</i> ~

1177
01:02:30,588 --> 01:02:32,575
Welcome home, Mr. Bailey.

1178
01:02:37,806 --> 01:02:39,940
Well, I'll be ...

1179
01:02:44,831 --> 01:02:47,253
Mary, where did you ...

1180
01:02:53,885 --> 01:02:59,344
~ <i>I Love You Truly</i> ~

1181
01:02:59,527 --> 01:03:04,460
~ <i>Truly, Dear</i> ~

1182
01:03:04,597 --> 01:03:09,069
~ <i>Life with It's Shadows</i> ~

1183
01:03:09,188 --> 01:03:10,156
Oh, Mary ...

1184
01:03:10,262 --> 01:03:12,992
~ <i>Life with It's Tears</i> ~

1185
01:03:13,117 --> 01:03:15,538
Remember the night we broke 
the windows in this old house?

1186
01:03:15,675 --> 01:03:17,685
~ <i>Fade into Dreams</i> ~

1187
01:03:17,822 --> 01:03:20,014
This is what I wished for.

1188
01:03:20,176 --> 01:03:23,692
~ <i>When I Feel You Are Near</i> ~

1189
01:03:23,806 --> 01:03:26,615
Darling, you're wonderful.

1190
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:33,719
~ <i>I Love You Truly</i> ~

1191
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:40,955
~ <i>Truly, Dear</i> ~

1192
01:03:49,569 --> 01:03:53,614
- Martini, you rented a new house?
- Rent?

1193
01:03:54,866 --> 01:03:57,318
- You hear what he say, Mr. Bailey?
- What's that?

1194
01:03:57,418 --> 01:03:59,119
I own the house.

1195
01:03:59,329 --> 01:04:02,698
Me, Giuseppe Martini,
I own my own house.

1196
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:06,118
No more we live like a pigs
in this Potter's Field.

1197
01:04:06,218 --> 01:04:09,296
- Mary, Mary!
- Mary, come on, bring the baby.

1198
01:04:09,964 --> 01:04:11,749
I feel like a queen.

1199
01:04:11,849 --> 01:04:14,919
- I'll take the kids in the car.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Bailey. Thank you.

1200
01:04:15,019 --> 01:04:17,922
All right, kids, here. Here, get in here.

1201
01:04:18,022 --> 01:04:20,182
Now, one at a time.
Get right up on the seat there.

1202
01:04:21,726 --> 01:04:25,396
- Sit down, there.
- Here, now, get the dog, now. That's it.

1203
01:04:26,606 --> 01:04:28,816
- Goat, too.
- Everybody!

1204
01:04:29,109 --> 01:04:30,484
All in!

1205
01:04:32,654 --> 01:04:34,571
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

1206
01:04:37,242 --> 01:04:38,367
All in?

1207
01:04:57,345 --> 01:04:59,805
Mr. and Mrs. Martini, welcome home.

1208
01:05:00,306 --> 01:05:02,850
Good old George,
he's always making a speech.

1209
01:05:03,893 --> 01:05:05,227
Hee-haw!

1210
01:05:05,437 --> 01:05:09,064
- Sam Wainwright.
- Oh, who cares.

1211
01:05:09,607 --> 01:05:12,776
Bread. That this house
may never know hunger.

1212
01:05:13,528 --> 01:05:16,864
Salt. That life may always have flavor.

1213
01:05:17,282 --> 01:05:20,734
And wine. That joy and prosperity
may reign forever.

1214
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:22,578
Enter the Martini castle.

1215
01:05:24,414 --> 01:05:26,866
Look, Mr. Potter,
it's no skin off my nose.

1216
01:05:26,966 --> 01:05:28,784
I'm just your little rent collector.

1217
01:05:28,884 --> 01:05:31,662
But you can't laugh off
this Bailey Park anymore.

1218
01:05:31,762 --> 01:05:32,880
Look at it.

1219
01:05:33,756 --> 01:05:35,791
Congressman Black is here
to see you, sir.

1220
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:38,835
Oh, tell the Congressman to wait.
Go on.

1221
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,713
Fifteen years ago, a half a dozen
houses stuck here and there.

1222
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:44,048
There's the old cemetery, squirrels,
buttercups, daisies.

1223
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:46,350
I used to hunt rabbits there myself.

1224
01:05:47,227 --> 01:05:48,561
Look at it today.

1225
01:05:48,687 --> 01:05:51,522
Dozens of the prettiest little homes
you ever saw,

1226
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:54,893
90% owned by suckers
who used to pay rent to you.

1227
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:58,313
Your Potter's Field, my dear
Mr. Employer, is becoming just that.

1228
01:05:58,413 --> 01:06:01,816
And are the local yokels making with
those David and Goliath wisecracks.

1229
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:03,651
Oh, they are, are they?

1230
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:06,654
Even though they know
the Baileys never made a dime out of it.

1231
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:09,240
You know very well why.
The Baileys were all chumps.

1232
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,284
Every one of these homes is worth

1233
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,495
twice what it cost
the Building and Loan to build.

1234
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:15,997
- If I were you, Mr. Potter...
- You are not me.

1235
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:19,592
As I say, it's no skin off my nose,

1236
01:06:22,721 --> 01:06:24,672
but one of these days
this bright young man

1237
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:27,391
is gonna be asking
George Bailey for a job.

1238
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:32,889
The Bailey family has been
a boil on my neck long enough.

1239
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:35,107
- Yes, sir?
- Come in here.

1240
01:06:35,442 --> 01:06:37,602
We just stopped in town
to take a look at the new factory,

1241
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:39,687
and then we're gonna
drive on down to Florida.

1242
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:41,397
Why don't you
have your friends join us?

1243
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:44,909
Why, sure. Hey, why don't you kids
drive down with us, huh?

1244
01:06:45,285 --> 01:06:48,029
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.

1245
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:50,198
Still got the nose
to the old grindstone, eh?

1246
01:06:50,298 --> 01:06:53,868
Jane, I offered to let George in
on the ground floor in plastics,

1247
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:55,119
and he turned me down cold.

1248
01:06:55,219 --> 01:06:57,997
- Oh, now, don't rub it in.
- I'm not rubbing it in.

1249
01:06:58,097 --> 01:06:59,707
Well, I guess we better run along.

1250
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:01,834
- Awfully happy to have met you, Mary.
- Nice meeting you, too.

1251
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:03,294
- Goodbye. Glad to see you.
- Goodbye, George.

1252
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:04,837
So long, George.
See you in the funny papers.

1253
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:07,006
- So long, Mary.
- Bye, Sam. Have fun.

1254
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:09,092
- Thanks for dropping around.
- Florida!

1255
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:10,893
- Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw.

1256
01:07:40,172 --> 01:07:41,506
Thank you, sir.

1257
01:07:42,049 --> 01:07:44,042
- That's quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
- You like it?

1258
01:07:44,142 --> 01:07:45,677
I'll send you a box.

1259
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:55,812
Well, I...

1260
01:07:57,356 --> 01:07:58,849
I suppose I'll find out sooner or later,

1261
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:01,818
but just what exactly
did you want to see me about?

1262
01:08:03,904 --> 01:08:07,532
George, now that's just what I like
so much about you.

1263
01:08:08,034 --> 01:08:11,653
George, I am an old man,
and most people hate me.

1264
01:08:11,753 --> 01:08:14,740
But I don't like them, either,
so that makes it all even.

1265
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,992
You know just as well as I do

1266
01:08:17,092 --> 01:08:19,620
that I run practically everything
in this town

1267
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:22,297
but the Bailey Building and Loan.

1268
01:08:22,757 --> 01:08:26,835
You know, also, that for a number of
years I've been trying to get control of it.

1269
01:08:26,935 --> 01:08:29,554
Or kill it. But I haven't been able to do it.

1270
01:08:29,764 --> 01:08:31,723
You have been stopping me.

1271
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:35,969
In fact, you have beaten me, George,

1272
01:08:36,069 --> 01:08:40,565
and as anyone in this county
can tell you, that takes some doing.

1273
01:08:41,651 --> 01:08:44,353
Take during the Depression,
for instance.

1274
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:47,522
You and I were the only ones
that kept our heads.

1275
01:08:47,622 --> 01:08:51,568
You saved the Building and Loan.
I saved all the rest.

1276
01:08:51,668 --> 01:08:54,321
Yes. Well, most people say
you stole all the rest.

1277
01:08:54,421 --> 01:08:57,707
The envious ones say that,
George, the suckers.

1278
01:08:58,668 --> 01:09:02,754
Now, I have stated my side very frankly.

1279
01:09:03,089 --> 01:09:05,256
Now let's look at your side.

1280
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:13,098
Young man, 27-28, married,
making, say, $40 a week.

1281
01:09:13,224 --> 01:09:15,133
- $45.
- $45.

1282
01:09:15,233 --> 01:09:16,351
$45.

1283
01:09:16,727 --> 01:09:20,597
Out of which, after supporting
your mother and paying your bills,

1284
01:09:20,697 --> 01:09:23,775
you're able to keep, say, $10,
if you skimp.

1285
01:09:23,901 --> 01:09:28,188
A child or two comes along, and you
won't even be able to save the $10.

1286
01:09:28,288 --> 01:09:33,819
Now, if this young man of 28
was a common, ordinary yokel,

1287
01:09:33,919 --> 01:09:35,487
I'd say he was doing fine.

1288
01:09:35,587 --> 01:09:39,865
But George Bailey is not a common,
ordinary yokel.

1289
01:09:39,965 --> 01:09:43,619
He is an intelligent, smart,
ambitious young man,

1290
01:09:43,719 --> 01:09:46,914
who hates his job,
who hates the Building and Loan

1291
01:09:47,014 --> 01:09:48,674
almost as much as I do.

1292
01:09:49,384 --> 01:09:53,971
A young man who's been dying to get
out on his own ever since he was born.

1293
01:09:54,389 --> 01:09:57,216
A young man... The smartest one
of the crowd, mind you.

1294
01:09:57,316 --> 01:09:58,884
A young man who has to sit by

1295
01:09:58,984 --> 01:10:02,430
and watch his friends go places
because he's trapped.

1296
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:06,183
Yes, sir,
trapped into frittering his life away,

1297
01:10:06,283 --> 01:10:08,861
playing nursemaid
to a lot of garlic eaters.

1298
01:10:10,321 --> 01:10:13,657
Do I paint a correct picture,
or do I exaggerate?

1299
01:10:16,119 --> 01:10:18,654
- Now, what's your point, Mr. Potter?
- My point?

1300
01:10:18,754 --> 01:10:21,323
- My point is I want to hire you.
- Hire me?

1301
01:10:21,423 --> 01:10:24,668
Yeah, I want you to manage my affairs,
run my properties.

1302
01:10:24,919 --> 01:10:30,007
George, I'll start you out
at $20,000 a year.

1303
01:10:33,845 --> 01:10:36,797
$20,000 a year?

1304
01:10:36,897 --> 01:10:40,259
You wouldn't mind living
in the nicest house in town,

1305
01:10:40,359 --> 01:10:43,053
buying your wife a lot of fine clothes,

1306
01:10:43,153 --> 01:10:45,931
a couple of business trips
to New York a year,

1307
01:10:46,031 --> 01:10:47,850
maybe once in a while Europe.

1308
01:10:47,950 --> 01:10:49,268
You wouldn't mind that,
would you, George?

1309
01:10:49,368 --> 01:10:50,694
Would I?

1310
01:10:53,698 --> 01:10:56,025
You're not talking to somebody else
around here, are you?

1311
01:10:56,125 --> 01:10:57,818
You know, this is me.
You remember me?

1312
01:10:57,918 --> 01:10:59,695
- George Bailey.
- George Bailey.

1313
01:10:59,795 --> 01:11:02,873
Yeah, George Bailey,
whose ship has just come in.

1314
01:11:04,167 --> 01:11:07,377
Provided he has enough brains
to climb aboard.

1315
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:17,137
Holy mackerel.

1316
01:11:20,225 --> 01:11:22,760
Well, how about the Building and Loan?

1317
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:26,271
Oh, confound it, man,
are you afraid of success?

1318
01:11:26,397 --> 01:11:31,310
I'm offering you a three-years contract
at $20,000 a year, starting today.

1319
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:33,111
Is it a deal, or isn't it?

1320
01:11:34,739 --> 01:11:36,406
Well, Mr. Potter, I...

1321
01:11:36,616 --> 01:11:40,409
I know I ought to jump
at the chance but I... I just...

1322
01:11:41,537 --> 01:11:45,573
I wonder if it would be possible for you
to give me 24 hours to think it over?

1323
01:11:45,673 --> 01:11:47,325
Sure, sure, sure.

1324
01:11:47,425 --> 01:11:49,994
You go on home
and talk about it to your wife.

1325
01:11:50,094 --> 01:11:51,621
I'd like to do that.

1326
01:11:51,721 --> 01:11:54,040
Yeah. In the meantime,
I'll draw up the papers.

1327
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:56,050
- All right, sir.
- Okay, George?

1328
01:11:57,553 --> 01:11:59,095
Okay, Mr. Potter.

1329
01:12:07,271 --> 01:12:11,566
No. No. No, no,
now wait a minute, here.

1330
01:12:12,442 --> 01:12:15,270
I don't need 24 hours.
I don't have to talk to anybody.

1331
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:19,107
I know right now, and the answer is no.
No, doggone it!

1332
01:12:19,207 --> 01:12:21,651
You sit around here,
and you spin your little webs,

1333
01:12:21,751 --> 01:12:24,195
and you think the whole world
revolves around you and your money.

1334
01:12:24,295 --> 01:12:25,864
Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter.

1335
01:12:25,964 --> 01:12:29,117
In the whole vast configuration of things,

1336
01:12:29,217 --> 01:12:31,995
I'd say you were nothing
but a scurvy little spider.

1337
01:12:32,095 --> 01:12:33,087
You...

1338
01:12:34,548 --> 01:12:36,674
And that goes for you, too!

1339
01:12:40,762 --> 01:12:42,847
And it goes for you, too!

1340
01:12:49,813 --> 01:12:52,857
You wouldn't mind living
in the nicest house in town,

1341
01:12:53,317 --> 01:12:55,902
buying your wife a lot of fine clothes,

1342
01:12:56,153 --> 01:12:59,647
going to New York on a business trip
a couple of times a year,

1343
01:12:59,747 --> 01:13:01,991
maybe Europe once in a while.

1344
01:13:02,951 --> 01:13:05,069
I know what I'm gonna do tomorrow

1345
01:13:05,169 --> 01:13:08,364
and the next day and next year
and the year after that.

1346
01:13:08,464 --> 01:13:11,576
I'm shaking the dust
of this crummy little town off my feet,

1347
01:13:11,676 --> 01:13:13,494
and I'm gonna see the world.

1348
01:13:13,594 --> 01:13:16,331
And then I'm gonna build things.
I'm gonna build air fields.

1349
01:13:16,431 --> 01:13:19,000
I'm gonna build skyscrapers
100 stories high.

1350
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,510
I'm gonna build a bridge a mile long.

1351
01:13:22,763 --> 01:13:25,932
What is it you want, Mary?
What, you want the moon?

1352
01:13:26,516 --> 01:13:28,927
If you do, just say the word,
I'll throw a lasso around it

1353
01:13:29,027 --> 01:13:30,770
and pull her down for you.

1354
01:13:30,979 --> 01:13:33,473
Buffalo gal
Won't you come out tonight?

1355
01:13:33,573 --> 01:13:36,434
Won't you come out tonight?
Won't you come out tonight?

1356
01:13:36,534 --> 01:13:39,478
Buffalo gal
Won't you come out tonight

1357
01:13:39,578 --> 01:13:41,279
And

1358
01:13:48,037 --> 01:13:49,663
- Hi.
- Hi.

1359
01:13:55,127 --> 01:13:56,419
Mary Hatch,

1360
01:13:58,923 --> 01:14:01,716
why in the world
did you ever marry a guy like me?

1361
01:14:03,177 --> 01:14:05,387
To keep from being an old maid.

1362
01:14:05,846 --> 01:14:07,297
You could have
married Sam Wainwright

1363
01:14:07,397 --> 01:14:09,099
and anybody else in town.

1364
01:14:09,475 --> 01:14:12,185
I didn't want
to marry anybody else in town.

1365
01:14:13,229 --> 01:14:15,230
I want my baby to look like you.

1366
01:14:15,398 --> 01:14:17,391
You didn't even have a honeymoon.

1367
01:14:17,491 --> 01:14:18,858
I promised you...

1368
01:14:19,694 --> 01:14:21,987
- Your what?
- My baby.

1369
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:26,241
Your... Your...

1370
01:14:27,118 --> 01:14:28,827
Mary, you on the nest?

1371
01:14:29,078 --> 01:14:32,998
- George Bailey lassoes stork.
- Lassoes a stork!

1372
01:14:37,003 --> 01:14:40,922
You mean you...
What is it, a boy or a girl?

1373
01:14:44,552 --> 01:14:49,047
Now, you've probably already guessed
that George never leaves Bedford Falls.

1374
01:14:49,147 --> 01:14:52,892
- No!
- Mary had her baby, a boy.

1375
01:14:53,602 --> 01:14:55,687
Then she had another one, a girl.

1376
01:14:55,938 --> 01:14:57,973
Day after day she worked away,

1377
01:14:58,073 --> 01:15:00,984
remaking the old Granville house
into a home.

1378
01:15:01,193 --> 01:15:04,779
Night after night,
George came back late from the office.

1379
01:15:08,492 --> 01:15:10,744
Potter was bearing down hard.

1380
01:15:15,958 --> 01:15:17,584
Then came a war.

1381
01:15:18,377 --> 01:15:21,963
Ma Bailey and Mrs. Hatch
joined the Red Cross and sewed.

1382
01:15:22,423 --> 01:15:26,551
Mary had two more babies
but still found time to run the USO.

1383
01:15:26,761 --> 01:15:30,305
Sam Wainwright made a fortune
in plastic hoods for planes.

1384
01:15:30,598 --> 01:15:33,016
Potter became head of the draft board.

1385
01:15:33,434 --> 01:15:34,809
One-A.

1386
01:15:35,936 --> 01:15:37,187
One-A.

1387
01:15:40,065 --> 01:15:41,190
One-A.

1388
01:15:41,483 --> 01:15:43,984
Gower and Uncle Billy sold war bonds.

1389
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:48,447
Bert the cop was wounded
in North Africa, got the Silver Star.

1390
01:15:48,990 --> 01:15:52,284
Ernie the taxi driver
parachuted into France.

1391
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:55,788
Marty helped capture
the Remagen Bridge.

1392
01:15:56,164 --> 01:15:57,239
Harry...

1393
01:15:57,339 --> 01:15:59,666
Harry Bailey topped them all.

1394
01:16:00,001 --> 01:16:03,662
A Navy flier, he shot down 15 planes,

1395
01:16:03,762 --> 01:16:08,092
two of them as they were about
to crash into a transport full of soldiers.

1396
01:16:09,719 --> 01:16:12,096
- Yes, but George.
- George?

1397
01:16:12,347 --> 01:16:14,256
Four-F on account of his ear,

1398
01:16:14,356 --> 01:16:16,850
George fought the battle
of Bedford Falls.

1399
01:16:17,352 --> 01:16:19,678
Now, hold on! Hold on! Hold on now!

1400
01:16:19,778 --> 01:16:21,305
Don't you know there's a war on?

1401
01:16:21,405 --> 01:16:23,190
Air raid warden.

1402
01:16:31,950 --> 01:16:33,400
Paper drives.

1403
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:34,819
Scrap drives.

1404
01:16:34,919 --> 01:16:36,320
Rubber drives.

1405
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:41,458
Like everybody else on VE Day,
he wept and prayed.

1406
01:16:43,711 --> 01:16:46,580
On VJ Day, he wept and prayed again.

1407
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,833
Joseph, now show him
what happened today.

1408
01:16:48,933 --> 01:16:49,925
Yes, sir.

1409
01:16:50,677 --> 01:16:53,796
This morning, day before Christmas,
about 10:00 a.m.

1410
01:16:53,896 --> 01:16:55,464
Bedford Falls time...

1411
01:16:55,564 --> 01:16:57,850
Hey, Ernie. Look at that.

1412
01:17:03,356 --> 01:17:04,348
It's gonna snow again.

1413
01:17:04,448 --> 01:17:07,726
What do you mean, it's gonna snow?
Look at the headlines. The President...

1414
01:17:07,826 --> 01:17:10,271
I know, I know, George.
That's marvelous.

1415
01:17:10,371 --> 01:17:11,856
Commander Harry Bailey!

1416
01:17:11,956 --> 01:17:14,483
Mr. Gower, look at this,
the second page.

1417
01:17:14,583 --> 01:17:15,818
Now, look, this is for you.

1418
01:17:15,918 --> 01:17:17,319
- This is for you. That's for you.
- Okay.

1419
01:17:17,419 --> 01:17:19,246
- Right, thanks.
- See you again.

1420
01:17:20,915 --> 01:17:23,041
Be sure you spell the name right.

1421
01:17:34,179 --> 01:17:35,671
Extra! Read all about it!

1422
01:17:35,771 --> 01:17:38,215
George, George! It's Harry now
on long-distance from Washington.

1423
01:17:38,315 --> 01:17:39,841
Harry! What do you know about that!

1424
01:17:39,941 --> 01:17:41,426
He reversed the charges.
It's okay, isn't it?

1425
01:17:41,526 --> 01:17:43,803
Reversed the charges?
Of course it is for a hero.

1426
01:17:43,903 --> 01:17:45,271
Harry!

1427
01:17:45,397 --> 01:17:49,442
You old seven times
a son of a gun. Congratulations.

1428
01:17:49,610 --> 01:17:52,111
How's Mother standing it? She did?

1429
01:17:52,446 --> 01:17:53,688
What do you know?

1430
01:17:53,788 --> 01:17:55,481
Mother had lunch
with the President's wife.

1431
01:17:55,581 --> 01:17:56,649
Wait till Martha hears about this.

1432
01:17:56,749 --> 01:17:58,860
- What did they have to eat?
- What'd they have to eat?

1433
01:17:58,960 --> 01:17:59,986
Harry,

1434
01:18:00,086 --> 01:18:03,198
you should see what they're cooking up
in the town for you.

1435
01:18:03,298 --> 01:18:04,365
Oh, they are?

1436
01:18:04,465 --> 01:18:06,326
The Navy's gonna fly Mother home
this afternoon.

1437
01:18:06,426 --> 01:18:07,543
In a plane?

1438
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,038
What? Uncle Billy?

1439
01:18:10,138 --> 01:18:12,498
- Has Uncle Billy come in yet?
- He stopped at the bank first.

1440
01:18:12,598 --> 01:18:16,044
He's not here right now, Harry.
But look, now, tell me about it.

1441
01:18:16,144 --> 01:18:17,170
- George. George, George.
- What?

1442
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:18,379
- That man is here again.
- What man?

1443
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:20,056
Bank examiner.

1444
01:18:21,141 --> 01:18:23,259
Harry, talk to Eustace for a minute,
will you?

1445
01:18:23,359 --> 01:18:24,552
I'll be right back.

1446
01:18:24,652 --> 01:18:26,095
- Well...
- Harry.

1447
01:18:26,195 --> 01:18:28,681
- Good morning, sir.
- Carter, bank examiner.

1448
01:18:28,781 --> 01:18:30,892
- Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1449
01:18:30,992 --> 01:18:32,727
We're all excited around here.

1450
01:18:32,827 --> 01:18:34,896
My brother just got
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

1451
01:18:34,996 --> 01:18:37,732
- The President just decorated him.
- Well, I guess they do those things.

1452
01:18:37,832 --> 01:18:40,660
- Well, I trust you had a good year.
- Good year?

1453
01:18:40,869 --> 01:18:43,996
Well, between you and me,
Mr. Carter, we're broke.

1454
01:18:44,206 --> 01:18:45,873
Yeah, very funny.

1455
01:18:48,043 --> 01:18:50,828
Well, now,
come right in here, Mr. Carter.

1456
01:18:50,928 --> 01:18:53,164
Although I shouldn't wonder
when you okay reverse charges

1457
01:18:53,264 --> 01:18:54,999
on personal long-distance calls.

1458
01:18:55,099 --> 01:18:56,668
- George, shall we hang up?
- No, no.

1459
01:18:56,768 --> 01:18:58,419
He wants to talk to Uncle Billy.
You just hold on, there.

1460
01:18:58,519 --> 01:19:01,256
Now, if you'll cooperate,
I'd like to finish with you by tonight.

1461
01:19:01,356 --> 01:19:04,217
I want to spend Christmas
in Elmira with my family.

1462
01:19:04,317 --> 01:19:05,551
I don't blame you at all, Mr. Carter.

1463
01:19:05,651 --> 01:19:06,936
Just step right in here. We'll fix you up.

1464
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:11,023
December 24.

1465
01:19:16,613 --> 01:19:19,198
$8,000.

1466
01:19:20,325 --> 01:19:22,902
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter.
- Merry Christmas.

1467
01:19:23,002 --> 01:19:26,406
Well, good morning, Mr. Potter.
What's the news?

1468
01:19:26,506 --> 01:19:30,243
Well, well, well, "Harry Bailey
wins Congressional Medal."

1469
01:19:30,343 --> 01:19:32,412
That couldn't be one of the Bailey boys.

1470
01:19:32,512 --> 01:19:36,082
You just can't keep those Baileys down,
now can you, Mr. Potter?

1471
01:19:36,182 --> 01:19:38,584
How does slacker George
feel about that?

1472
01:19:38,684 --> 01:19:39,918
Very jealous. Very jealous.

1473
01:19:40,018 --> 01:19:42,212
He only lost three buttons off his vest.

1474
01:19:42,312 --> 01:19:44,339
Of course,
slacker George would've gotten

1475
01:19:44,439 --> 01:19:46,300
two of these medals if he had gone.

1476
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:47,934
- Bad ear.
- Yes.

1477
01:19:48,102 --> 01:19:51,555
After all, Potter, some people
like George had to stay at home.

1478
01:19:51,655 --> 01:19:55,692
Not every heel was
in Germany and Japan.

1479
01:20:02,992 --> 01:20:06,703
- Good morning, Mr. Bailey.
- Good morning, Horace.

1480
01:20:07,747 --> 01:20:10,490
- I guess you forgot something.
- Huh?

1481
01:20:10,590 --> 01:20:12,409
- You forgot something.
- What?

1482
01:20:12,509 --> 01:20:13,994
Well, aren't you going
to make a deposit?

1483
01:20:14,094 --> 01:20:15,078
Oh, sure, sure I am.

1484
01:20:15,178 --> 01:20:18,590
Well, then, it's usually customary
to bring the money with you.

1485
01:20:19,133 --> 01:20:23,345
Oh, shucks, I knew I had.

1486
01:20:25,181 --> 01:20:27,257
How about that finger there?

1487
01:20:27,357 --> 01:20:28,433
Well, I...

1488
01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:30,518
Bailey.

1489
01:20:37,026 --> 01:20:39,444
Take me back there. Hurry up.

1490
01:20:41,530 --> 01:20:43,782
Come on, look sharp.

1491
01:21:01,467 --> 01:21:02,967
Take me back.

1492
01:21:12,812 --> 01:21:16,139
Just make yourself at home, Mr. Carter.
I got those books for you here.

1493
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:17,641
Oh, hello, Vi.

1494
01:21:17,741 --> 01:21:19,309
George, can I see you for a second?

1495
01:21:19,409 --> 01:21:22,278
Why, of course you can.
Go on in the office there.

1496
01:21:22,446 --> 01:21:25,281
Uncle Billy, talk to Harry.
He's on the telephone.

1497
01:21:26,075 --> 01:21:28,860
Hurry up, Uncle Billy, hurry.
Long distance, Washington.

1498
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,070
Hey, here's Harry on the phone.

1499
01:21:30,170 --> 01:21:31,905
You know, your nephew,
remember? Harry.

1500
01:21:32,005 --> 01:21:33,248
- Here he is.
- Hurry up.

1501
01:21:33,749 --> 01:21:37,502
Hello? Hello.
Yes, Harry, yes, everything's fine.

1502
01:21:38,003 --> 01:21:40,204
I ought to have my head examined.

1503
01:21:40,304 --> 01:21:43,173
$8,000. It's got to be somewhere.

1504
01:21:49,347 --> 01:21:50,597
Here you are.

1505
01:21:51,182 --> 01:21:52,266
Character?

1506
01:21:52,892 --> 01:21:54,176
If I had any character, I'd...

1507
01:21:54,276 --> 01:21:57,680
It takes a lot of character to leave
your hometown and start all over again.

1508
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:59,265
No, George, don't.

1509
01:21:59,365 --> 01:22:01,350
Here now, you're broke, aren't you?

1510
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:03,060
- I know, but...
- What do you want to do,

1511
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:04,945
hock your furs and that hat?

1512
01:22:06,322 --> 01:22:07,773
You want to walk to New York?

1513
01:22:07,873 --> 01:22:09,650
You know, they charge
for meals and rent up there,

1514
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:11,152
just the same as they do
in Bedford Falls.

1515
01:22:11,252 --> 01:22:13,036
- Yeah, sure.
- No, that's a loan, now.

1516
01:22:13,329 --> 01:22:15,622
That's my business, Building and Loan.

1517
01:22:15,790 --> 01:22:18,826
Besides, you'll get a job.
Good luck to you.

1518
01:22:18,926 --> 01:22:21,086
I'm glad I know you, George Bailey.

1519
01:22:26,301 --> 01:22:29,044
- Say hello to New York for me.
- Yeah, yeah, sure, I will.

1520
01:22:29,144 --> 01:22:31,054
Now, let's hear from you
once in a while.

1521
01:22:35,018 --> 01:22:38,312
- Merry Christmas, Vi.
- Merry Christmas, George.

1522
01:22:39,230 --> 01:22:41,682
- Mr. Bailey.
- Oh, Mr. Carter, I'm sorry.

1523
01:22:41,782 --> 01:22:43,267
I'll be right with you.
Uncle Billy in there?

1524
01:22:43,367 --> 01:22:44,852
Yeah, he's in his office.

1525
01:22:44,952 --> 01:22:47,154
What's going on?

1526
01:22:47,363 --> 01:22:49,364
The bank examiner's here.

1527
01:22:50,158 --> 01:22:53,076
- He's here?
- Yeah. He wants the accounts payable...

1528
01:22:53,203 --> 01:22:54,778
What's the matter with you?

1529
01:22:54,878 --> 01:22:56,288
Come here.

1530
01:23:16,559 --> 01:23:17,530
Eustace.

1531
01:23:17,630 --> 01:23:19,353
- Yeah?
- Come here a minute.

1532
01:23:21,105 --> 01:23:23,349
Did you see Uncle Billy
with any cash last night?

1533
01:23:23,449 --> 01:23:25,943
He had it on his desk counting it
before he closed up.

1534
01:23:27,111 --> 01:23:28,687
Now, look, did you buy anything?

1535
01:23:28,787 --> 01:23:31,065
- Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
- All right, all right.

1536
01:23:31,165 --> 01:23:33,776
Now, we'll go over every step you took
since you left the house.

1537
01:23:33,876 --> 01:23:34,868
- Right. This way.
- Come on.

1538
01:23:44,795 --> 01:23:46,788
And did you put the envelope
in your pocket?

1539
01:23:46,888 --> 01:23:49,999
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

1540
01:23:50,099 --> 01:23:52,877
Maybe! I don't want any maybe.
We've got to find that money!

1541
01:23:52,977 --> 01:23:54,504
- I'm no good to you, George.
- Uncle Billy, look,

1542
01:23:54,604 --> 01:23:57,173
do you realize what's going
to happen if we don't find it?

1543
01:23:57,273 --> 01:23:58,299
Listen to me.

1544
01:23:58,399 --> 01:24:00,176
Do you have any secret hiding place
here in the house?

1545
01:24:00,276 --> 01:24:02,303
Someplace you would have...
Someplace you hide the money?

1546
01:24:02,403 --> 01:24:04,013
I've gone over the whole house,

1547
01:24:04,113 --> 01:24:08,017
even in rooms that have been locked
since I lost Laura.

1548
01:24:08,117 --> 01:24:11,229
Listen to me, listen to me! Think, think!

1549
01:24:11,329 --> 01:24:15,400
I can't think anymore, George.
I can't think anymore. It hurts.

1550
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:18,403
Where's that money,
you silly, stupid old fool?

1551
01:24:18,503 --> 01:24:21,239
Where's that money?
Do you realize what this means?

1552
01:24:21,339 --> 01:24:24,333
It means bankruptcy and scandal
and prison!

1553
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:26,744
That's what it means.

1554
01:24:26,844 --> 01:24:30,089
One of us is going to jail.
Well, it's not going to be me.

1555
01:24:52,863 --> 01:24:53,938
Hello, darling.

1556
01:24:54,038 --> 01:24:55,815
- Hello, Daddy.
- Hello, Daddy.

1557
01:24:55,915 --> 01:24:57,775
How do you like it?

1558
01:24:57,875 --> 01:24:59,535
- Bless you!
- Bless you!

1559
01:25:01,288 --> 01:25:02,447
Did you bring the wreath?

1560
01:25:02,547 --> 01:25:04,365
Yes, Daddy, did you bring
the Christmas wreath?

1561
01:25:04,465 --> 01:25:05,450
What wreath?

1562
01:25:05,550 --> 01:25:07,994
The Merry Christmas wreath
for the window.

1563
01:25:08,094 --> 01:25:09,412
No. I left it at the office.

1564
01:25:09,512 --> 01:25:11,456
- Is it snowing?
- Yeah, it just started.

1565
01:25:11,556 --> 01:25:14,634
- Where's your coat and hat?
- Left them at the office.

1566
01:25:14,801 --> 01:25:15,877
What's the matter?

1567
01:25:15,977 --> 01:25:18,554
Nothing's the matter.
Everything's all right.

1568
01:25:26,229 --> 01:25:29,515
Come on, Pete, you're a big boy.
You can help me get this star up.

1569
01:25:29,615 --> 01:25:32,610
Way up at the top. There. That's it.

1570
01:25:33,236 --> 01:25:37,031
All right, fill in that little bare spot
right there. Right there.

1571
01:25:39,242 --> 01:25:42,736
Isn't it wonderful about Harry?
We're famous, George.

1572
01:25:42,836 --> 01:25:46,581
Bet I had 50 calls today
about the parade, the banquet.

1573
01:25:46,749 --> 01:25:48,833
Your mother's so excited. She...

1574
01:26:09,438 --> 01:26:11,932
Must she keep playing that?

1575
01:26:12,032 --> 01:26:14,851
I have to practice it
for the party tonight, Daddy.

1576
01:26:14,951 --> 01:26:18,021
Mama said we could stay up
till midnight and sing Christmas carols.

1577
01:26:18,121 --> 01:26:19,614
Can you sing, Daddy?

1578
01:26:19,990 --> 01:26:21,566
Better hurry and shave.

1579
01:26:21,666 --> 01:26:24,611
- The families will be here soon.
- Families.

1580
01:26:24,711 --> 01:26:27,163
I don't want the families over here.

1581
01:26:28,958 --> 01:26:31,993
Come on out in the kitchen with me
while I finish dinner.

1582
01:26:32,093 --> 01:26:35,171
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1583
01:26:35,297 --> 01:26:37,416
- Have a hectic day?
- Oh, yeah.

1584
01:26:37,516 --> 01:26:40,427
Another big red-letter day
for the Baileys.

1585
01:26:40,886 --> 01:26:43,714
Daddy, the Browns next door
have a new car. You should see it.

1586
01:26:43,814 --> 01:26:46,049
Well, what's the matter with our car?
Isn't it good enough for you?

1587
01:26:46,149 --> 01:26:47,225
Yes, Daddy.

1588
01:26:47,476 --> 01:26:49,886
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1589
01:26:49,986 --> 01:26:52,230
- Excuse you for what?
- I burped.

1590
01:26:53,315 --> 01:26:54,725
All right, darling, you're excused.

1591
01:26:54,825 --> 01:26:57,569
Now, go on upstairs
and see if little Zuzu wants anything.

1592
01:26:58,112 --> 01:27:02,399
- Zuzu? What's the matter with Zuzu?
- Oh, she's just got a cold. She's in bed.

1593
01:27:02,499 --> 01:27:03,942
Caught it coming home from school.

1594
01:27:04,042 --> 01:27:06,570
They gave her a flower for a prize,
and she didn't want to crush it,

1595
01:27:06,670 --> 01:27:07,904
so she didn't button up her coat.

1596
01:27:08,004 --> 01:27:10,157
- What is it, a sore throat or what?
- It's just a cold.

1597
01:27:10,257 --> 01:27:11,533
- The doctor says it's nothing serious.
- The doctor?

1598
01:27:11,633 --> 01:27:13,368
- Was the doctor here?
- Yes, I called him right away.

1599
01:27:13,468 --> 01:27:14,703
He says it's nothing to worry about.

1600
01:27:14,803 --> 01:27:16,079
Is she running a temperature?
What is it?

1601
01:27:16,179 --> 01:27:18,248
Just a teensy one, 99.6.
She'll be all right.

1602
01:27:18,348 --> 01:27:19,791
Of course, it's this old house.

1603
01:27:19,891 --> 01:27:22,085
I don't know why
we don't all have pneumonia.

1604
01:27:22,185 --> 01:27:26,514
Drafty old barn.
Might as well be living in a refrigerator.

1605
01:27:26,724 --> 01:27:28,467
Why did we have
to live here in the first place

1606
01:27:28,567 --> 01:27:31,686
and stay around this measly,
crummy old town?

1607
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:35,056
- George, what's wrong?
- Wrong! Everything's wrong.

1608
01:27:35,156 --> 01:27:38,435
You call this a happy family?
Why do we have to have all these kids?

1609
01:27:38,535 --> 01:27:42,188
- Dad, how do you spell "frankincense"?
- I don't know. Ask your mother.

1610
01:27:42,288 --> 01:27:44,023
- Where're you going?
- I'm going up to see Zuzu.

1611
01:27:44,123 --> 01:27:46,533
He told me to write a play for tomorrow.

1612
01:27:57,378 --> 01:28:01,131
F-r-a-n-k-i-n...

1613
01:28:01,341 --> 01:28:02,716
Hi, Daddy!

1614
01:28:03,843 --> 01:28:07,054
- Well, what happened to you?
- I won a flower.

1615
01:28:07,347 --> 01:28:09,173
Wait now.
Where do you think you're going?

1616
01:28:09,273 --> 01:28:10,925
I want to give my flower a drink.

1617
01:28:11,025 --> 01:28:13,219
All right, all right.
Now, give Daddy the flower.

1618
01:28:13,319 --> 01:28:14,637
I'll give it a drink.

1619
01:28:14,737 --> 01:28:16,063
Now, here.

1620
01:28:17,565 --> 01:28:19,642
Look, Daddy!

1621
01:28:19,742 --> 01:28:21,143
Paste it!

1622
01:28:21,243 --> 01:28:23,779
Yeah, all right, all right. Give it here.

1623
01:28:26,241 --> 01:28:28,784
Now, we'll paste this together here.

1624
01:28:31,996 --> 01:28:35,157
There. There it is. Good as new.

1625
01:28:35,257 --> 01:28:37,326
Now, give the flower a drink.

1626
01:28:37,426 --> 01:28:38,869
Now, will you do something for me?

1627
01:28:38,969 --> 01:28:41,713
- What?
- Will you try to get some sleep?

1628
01:28:41,923 --> 01:28:44,834
I'm not sleepy.
I want to look at my flower.

1629
01:28:44,934 --> 01:28:49,346
I know, I know, but you just go to sleep
and then you can dream about it,

1630
01:28:49,639 --> 01:28:51,799
and it'll be a whole garden.

1631
01:28:51,899 --> 01:28:53,141
It will?

1632
01:29:01,568 --> 01:29:03,352
- Telephone!
- Telephone!

1633
01:29:03,452 --> 01:29:04,862
I'll get it.

1634
01:29:06,781 --> 01:29:07,948
Hello?

1635
01:29:08,867 --> 01:29:10,909
Yes, this is Mrs. Bailey.

1636
01:29:11,286 --> 01:29:14,154
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Welch.
I'm sure she'll be all right.

1637
01:29:14,254 --> 01:29:15,865
The doctor said
that she ought to be out of bed

1638
01:29:15,965 --> 01:29:17,157
in time to have her Christmas dinner.

1639
01:29:17,257 --> 01:29:18,784
- Is that Zuzu's teacher?
- Yes.

1640
01:29:18,884 --> 01:29:20,202
Let me speak to her.

1641
01:29:20,302 --> 01:29:22,754
Hello. Hello, Mrs. Welch?

1642
01:29:23,047 --> 01:29:25,583
This is George Bailey. I'm Zuzu's father.

1643
01:29:25,683 --> 01:29:27,376
Say, what kind of a teacher
are you, anyway?

1644
01:29:27,476 --> 01:29:29,753
What do you mean
sending her home like that, half naked?

1645
01:29:29,853 --> 01:29:32,381
Do you realize she'll probably end up
with pneumonia on account of you?

1646
01:29:32,481 --> 01:29:34,425
- George!
- Is this the sort of thing we pay taxes for

1647
01:29:34,525 --> 01:29:36,635
to have teachers like you?

1648
01:29:36,735 --> 01:29:39,972
Stupid, silly, careless people who send
our kids home without any clothes on?

1649
01:29:40,072 --> 01:29:41,890
You know, maybe my kids
aren't the best-dressed kids.

1650
01:29:41,990 --> 01:29:43,725
And maybe they don't have
any decent clothes...

1651
01:29:43,825 --> 01:29:45,610
That stupid...

1652
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:49,230
Hello, Mrs. Welch. I want to apologize...

1653
01:29:49,330 --> 01:29:51,449
Hello? Hello.

1654
01:29:53,201 --> 01:29:55,612
- She's hung up!
- I'll hang her up!

1655
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:58,907
- Hey, you! I'll knock your block off!
- What is that?

1656
01:29:59,007 --> 01:30:00,783
Hello! Who's this?

1657
01:30:00,883 --> 01:30:02,418
Oh, Mr. Welch?

1658
01:30:02,794 --> 01:30:04,245
Okay, that's fine, Mr. Welch.

1659
01:30:04,345 --> 01:30:06,414
Give me a chance to tell you
what I really think of your wife.

1660
01:30:06,514 --> 01:30:07,540
George, stop it.

1661
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,334
Will you get out and let me handle this?

1662
01:30:09,434 --> 01:30:11,969
Hello? Hello? What?

1663
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:15,256
Oh, you will, huh?

1664
01:30:15,356 --> 01:30:18,259
Okay, Mr. Welch. Any time
you think you're man enough, you...

1665
01:30:18,359 --> 01:30:19,852
Hello! Any...

1666
01:30:24,024 --> 01:30:24,995
Dad, how do you spell "hallelujah"?

1667
01:30:25,095 --> 01:30:27,101
How should I know?
What do you think I am, a dictionary?

1668
01:30:27,201 --> 01:30:28,436
Tommy, stop that! Stop it!

1669
01:30:28,536 --> 01:30:30,396
Janie, haven't you learned
that silly tune yet?

1670
01:30:30,496 --> 01:30:34,200
You play it over and over again.
Now stop it! Stop it!

1671
01:31:01,311 --> 01:31:02,937
I'm sorry, Mary.

1672
01:31:06,233 --> 01:31:08,109
Janie, I'm sorry.

1673
01:31:08,777 --> 01:31:12,947
I didn't mean that. I...
You go on and practice.

1674
01:31:18,495 --> 01:31:20,871
Pete, I owe you an apology, too.

1675
01:31:22,124 --> 01:31:23,499
I'm sorry.

1676
01:31:24,918 --> 01:31:27,753
- What do you want to know?
- Nothing, Daddy.

1677
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:36,504
What's the matter with everybody?

1678
01:31:36,604 --> 01:31:39,132
Janie, go on. I told you to practice.
Now, go on, play!

1679
01:31:39,232 --> 01:31:40,558
Oh, Daddy!

1680
01:31:45,938 --> 01:31:49,399
George, why must you
torture the children? Why don't you...

1681
01:31:50,151 --> 01:31:51,401
Mary...

1682
01:32:05,458 --> 01:32:07,367
Bedford 247, please.

1683
01:32:07,467 --> 01:32:09,494
- Is Daddy in trouble?
- Yes, Pete.

1684
01:32:09,594 --> 01:32:12,664
- Shall I pray for him?
- Yes, Janie, pray very hard.

1685
01:32:12,764 --> 01:32:14,799
- Me, too?
- You, too, Tommy.

1686
01:32:15,801 --> 01:32:17,761
Hello? Uncle Billy?

1687
01:32:19,055 --> 01:32:20,096
I'm in trouble, Mr. Potter.

1688
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:22,057
I need help.

1689
01:32:23,142 --> 01:32:26,011
Through some sort of an accident,
my company's short in their accounts.

1690
01:32:26,111 --> 01:32:27,888
The bank examiner got there today.

1691
01:32:27,988 --> 01:32:30,223
I've got to raise $8,000 immediately.

1692
01:32:30,323 --> 01:32:32,768
Oh, that's what the reporters wanted
to talk to you about?

1693
01:32:32,868 --> 01:32:34,186
- The reporters?
- Yes.

1694
01:32:34,286 --> 01:32:37,655
They called me up
from your Building and Loan.

1695
01:32:37,948 --> 01:32:41,318
Oh, there's a man over there
from the D.A.'s office, too.

1696
01:32:41,418 --> 01:32:42,611
He's looking for you.

1697
01:32:42,711 --> 01:32:46,323
Please help me, Mr. Potter.
Help me, won't you, please?

1698
01:32:46,423 --> 01:32:48,241
Can't you see what it means
to my family?

1699
01:32:48,341 --> 01:32:51,161
I'll pay any sort of a bonus on the loan,
any interest,

1700
01:32:51,261 --> 01:32:52,829
if you still want the Building and Loan...

1701
01:32:52,929 --> 01:32:56,416
George, could it possibly be there's
a slight discrepancy in the books?

1702
01:32:56,516 --> 01:32:58,043
No, sir.
There's nothing wrong with the books.

1703
01:32:58,143 --> 01:33:01,129
I've just misplaced $8,000.
I can't find it anywhere.

1704
01:33:01,229 --> 01:33:05,183
- You misplaced $8,000?
- Yes, sir.

1705
01:33:08,354 --> 01:33:11,890
- Have you notified the police?
- No, sir. I didn't want the publicity.

1706
01:33:11,990 --> 01:33:16,061
- Harry's homecoming tomorrow...
- They're going to believe that one.

1707
01:33:16,161 --> 01:33:18,438
What've you been doing, George?

1708
01:33:18,538 --> 01:33:20,232
Playing the market
with the company's money?

1709
01:33:20,332 --> 01:33:21,441
No, sir. No, sir, I haven't.

1710
01:33:21,541 --> 01:33:23,527
Is it a woman, then?

1711
01:33:23,627 --> 01:33:27,197
You know, it's all over town that
you've been giving money to Violet Bick.

1712
01:33:27,297 --> 01:33:28,323
What?

1713
01:33:28,423 --> 01:33:31,118
Not that it makes any difference to me,
but why did you come to me?

1714
01:33:31,218 --> 01:33:33,954
Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright
and ask him for the money?

1715
01:33:34,054 --> 01:33:35,622
I can't get a hold of him. He's in Europe.

1716
01:33:35,722 --> 01:33:37,124
Well, what about all your other friends?

1717
01:33:37,224 --> 01:33:39,543
They don't have that kind of money,
Mr. Potter. You know that.

1718
01:33:39,643 --> 01:33:41,552
You're the only one in town
that can help me.

1719
01:33:42,762 --> 01:33:46,056
I've suddenly become quite important.

1720
01:33:46,891 --> 01:33:49,552
What kind of security
would I have, George?

1721
01:33:49,652 --> 01:33:52,972
- Have you got any stocks?
- No, sir.

1722
01:33:53,072 --> 01:33:55,899
Bonds? Real estate?
Collateral of any kind?

1723
01:33:56,401 --> 01:34:00,604
I have some life insurance,
a $15,000 policy.

1724
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:04,408
- Yes. How much is your equity in it?
- Five hundred dollars.

1725
01:34:04,576 --> 01:34:06,410
Five hundred dollars?

1726
01:34:06,828 --> 01:34:09,454
And you ask me to lend you $8,000?

1727
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:14,126
Look at you. You used to be so cocky.

1728
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:17,546
You were going to go out
and conquer the world.

1729
01:34:18,089 --> 01:34:22,885
You once called me a warped,
frustrated old man.

1730
01:34:23,595 --> 01:34:26,930
What are you but a warped,
frustrated young man?

1731
01:34:27,515 --> 01:34:29,091
A miserable little clerk,

1732
01:34:29,191 --> 01:34:30,843
crawling in here
on your hands and knees

1733
01:34:30,943 --> 01:34:32,811
and begging for help.

1734
01:34:33,021 --> 01:34:34,930
No securities, no stocks, no bonds.

1735
01:34:35,030 --> 01:34:38,684
Nothing but a miserable
little $500 equity

1736
01:34:38,784 --> 01:34:40,944
in a life insurance policy.

1737
01:34:41,779 --> 01:34:44,198
You're worth more dead than alive.

1738
01:34:44,657 --> 01:34:47,651
Why don't you go to the riffraff
you love so much

1739
01:34:47,751 --> 01:34:50,287
and ask them to let you have $8,000?

1740
01:34:50,705 --> 01:34:51,906
You know why?

1741
01:34:52,006 --> 01:34:54,700
Because they'd run you
out of town on a rail.

1742
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:57,995
But I tell you
what I'm going to do for you, George.

1743
01:34:58,095 --> 01:35:01,248
Since the state examiner is still here,

1744
01:35:01,348 --> 01:35:03,876
as a stockholder
of the Building and Loan,

1745
01:35:03,976 --> 01:35:06,929
I'm going to swear out
a warrant for your arrest.

1746
01:35:07,305 --> 01:35:11,350
Misappropriation of funds,
manipulation, malfeasance.

1747
01:35:12,977 --> 01:35:15,346
All right, George, go ahead.

1748
01:35:15,446 --> 01:35:18,315
You can't hide in a little town like this.

1749
01:35:18,566 --> 01:35:20,776
Yeah, Bill? This is Potter.

1750
01:35:34,540 --> 01:35:37,834
Merry Christmas! Glad you come!

1751
01:35:38,378 --> 01:35:40,037
How about some of that good spaghetti?

1752
01:35:40,137 --> 01:35:41,837
We got everything.

1753
01:35:52,933 --> 01:35:54,183
Oh, God.

1754
01:35:57,521 --> 01:35:58,771
Oh, God.

1755
01:36:03,819 --> 01:36:05,695
Dear Father in Heaven,

1756
01:36:08,865 --> 01:36:10,825
I'm not a praying man,

1757
01:36:11,994 --> 01:36:14,912
but if you're up there
and you can hear me,

1758
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:18,165
show me the way.

1759
01:36:18,625 --> 01:36:20,960
I'm at the end of my rope. I...

1760
01:36:22,879 --> 01:36:24,839
Show me the way, O God.

1761
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:33,389
Are you all right, George?
Want somebody to take you home?

1762
01:36:36,059 --> 01:36:38,428
Why you drink so much, my friend?

1763
01:36:38,528 --> 01:36:41,897
Please go home, Mr. Bailey.
This is Christmas Eve.

1764
01:36:42,399 --> 01:36:44,900
Bailey? Which Bailey?

1765
01:36:45,527 --> 01:36:47,570
This is Mr. George Bailey.

1766
01:36:51,783 --> 01:36:54,652
The next time you talk to my wife
like that, you'll get worse!

1767
01:36:54,752 --> 01:36:56,070
She cried for an hour!

1768
01:36:56,170 --> 01:36:59,324
It isn't enough she slaves teaching
your stupid kids how to read and write,

1769
01:36:59,424 --> 01:37:01,951
- and you have to bawl her out.
- You get out of here, Mr. Welch!

1770
01:37:02,051 --> 01:37:03,494
Now, wait, I want to pay for my drink.

1771
01:37:03,594 --> 01:37:05,246
Never mind the money!
You get out of here quick!

1772
01:37:05,346 --> 01:37:08,299
- All right!
- You hit my best friend! Get out!

1773
01:37:13,638 --> 01:37:16,265
- You all right, George?
- Who was that?

1774
01:37:16,683 --> 01:37:19,761
He gone. No worry. He name is Welch.

1775
01:37:19,861 --> 01:37:22,638
- He no come into my place no more.
- Oh, Welch.

1776
01:37:22,738 --> 01:37:24,640
That's what I get for praying.

1777
01:37:24,740 --> 01:37:26,768
The last time he come in here.
You hear that, Nick?

1778
01:37:26,868 --> 01:37:27,977
Yes, you bet.

1779
01:37:28,077 --> 01:37:31,481
Where's my insurance policy?
Oh, here it is.

1780
01:37:31,581 --> 01:37:33,274
Oh, no, please,
don't go this way, Mr. Bailey.

1781
01:37:33,374 --> 01:37:35,026
- I'm all right.
- No, no, you no feel so good.

1782
01:37:35,126 --> 01:37:36,486
- Sit down and rest.
- I'm all right.

1783
01:37:36,586 --> 01:37:38,662
Please no go away, please!

1784
01:37:57,139 --> 01:37:59,474
What do you think you're doing?

1785
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:05,438
Now look what you did.
My great-grandfather planted this tree!

1786
01:38:06,315 --> 01:38:08,316
Hey, you! Hey, you!

1787
01:38:09,068 --> 01:38:12,821
Come back here, you drunken fool!
Get this car out of here!

1788
01:38:20,746 --> 01:38:24,332
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Look where you're going.

1789
01:39:11,172 --> 01:39:12,297
Help!

1790
01:39:13,883 --> 01:39:16,551
Help! Help!

1791
01:39:20,055 --> 01:39:21,890
Help! Help!

1792
01:39:24,518 --> 01:39:26,144
Help!

1793
01:39:29,064 --> 01:39:32,984
Help! Help! Help! Help!

1794
01:39:39,158 --> 01:39:41,451
Help! Help!

1795
01:39:58,384 --> 01:40:00,669
I didn't have time
to get some stylish underwear.

1796
01:40:00,769 --> 01:40:03,555
Wife gave me this
on my last birthday.

1797
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:05,974
I passed away in it.

1798
01:40:09,562 --> 01:40:12,439
Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too.

1799
01:40:15,610 --> 01:40:19,071
You should read the new book
Mark Twain's writing now.

1800
01:40:19,739 --> 01:40:21,607
How did you happen to fall in?

1801
01:40:21,707 --> 01:40:24,868
I didn't fall in.
I jumped in to save George.

1802
01:40:25,161 --> 01:40:28,080
You what? To save me?

1803
01:40:28,289 --> 01:40:31,367
Well, I did, didn't I?
You didn't go through with it, did you?

1804
01:40:31,467 --> 01:40:33,577
- Go through with what?
- Suicide.

1805
01:40:33,677 --> 01:40:36,747
It's against the law
to commit suicide around here.

1806
01:40:36,847 --> 01:40:39,667
Yeah, it's against the law
where I come from, too.

1807
01:40:39,767 --> 01:40:42,135
- Where do you come from?
- Heaven.

1808
01:40:47,267 --> 01:40:50,261
I had to act quickly.
That's why I jumped in.

1809
01:40:50,361 --> 01:40:52,763
I knew if I were drowning,
you'd try to save me.

1810
01:40:52,863 --> 01:40:55,816
You see, you did,
and that's how I saved you.

1811
01:40:56,526 --> 01:40:57,943
Very funny.

1812
01:40:58,152 --> 01:41:00,229
Your lip's bleeding, George.

1813
01:41:00,329 --> 01:41:04,400
Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw
in answer to a prayer a little bit ago.

1814
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:08,320
Oh, no, no, no, George,
I'm the answer to your prayer.

1815
01:41:08,420 --> 01:41:10,747
That's why I was sent down here.

1816
01:41:11,332 --> 01:41:14,493
- How'd you know my name?
- Oh, I know all about you.

1817
01:41:14,593 --> 01:41:16,412
I've watched you grow up
from a little boy.

1818
01:41:16,512 --> 01:41:17,913
What are you,
a mind reader or something?

1819
01:41:18,013 --> 01:41:19,123
No.

1820
01:41:19,223 --> 01:41:23,176
- Well, who are you then?
- Clarence Oddbody, AS2.

1821
01:41:23,845 --> 01:41:25,178
Oddbody?

1822
01:41:26,222 --> 01:41:28,348
AS2? What's that, AS2?

1823
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:30,350
Angel Second Class.

1824
01:41:40,737 --> 01:41:42,529
Cheerio, my good man.

1825
01:41:46,700 --> 01:41:48,117
Oh, brother.

1826
01:41:50,412 --> 01:41:51,704
Gee whiz.

1827
01:41:52,706 --> 01:41:55,541
I wonder what Martini
put in those drinks.

1828
01:41:57,586 --> 01:42:02,131
Hey, what's with you?
What did you say just a minute ago?

1829
01:42:02,424 --> 01:42:04,042
Why'd you want to save me?

1830
01:42:04,142 --> 01:42:07,720
That's what I was sent down for.
I'm your guardian angel.

1831
01:42:08,138 --> 01:42:10,256
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

1832
01:42:10,356 --> 01:42:14,677
Ridiculous of you to think
of killing yourself for money, $8,000.

1833
01:42:14,777 --> 01:42:17,805
Yeah, now, just things like that...
How do you know that?

1834
01:42:17,905 --> 01:42:21,942
I told you. I'm your guardian angel.
I know everything about you.

1835
01:42:22,944 --> 01:42:26,064
Well, you look about
like the kind of an angel I'd get.

1836
01:42:26,164 --> 01:42:29,108
Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you?
What happened to your wings?

1837
01:42:29,208 --> 01:42:33,245
I haven't won my wings yet.
That's why I'm an Angel Second Class.

1838
01:42:37,542 --> 01:42:39,077
I don't know whether I'd like it very much

1839
01:42:39,177 --> 01:42:41,120
being seen around
with an angel without any wings.

1840
01:42:41,220 --> 01:42:44,832
Oh, I've got to earn them,
and you'll help me, won't you?

1841
01:42:44,932 --> 01:42:46,300
Sure, sure.

1842
01:42:46,802 --> 01:42:49,428
- How?
- By letting me help you.

1843
01:42:49,638 --> 01:42:52,423
Yes. Only one way you can help me.

1844
01:42:52,523 --> 01:42:54,467
You don't happen to have
8,000 bucks on you, do you?

1845
01:42:54,567 --> 01:42:57,011
Oh, no. No.
We don't use money in heaven.

1846
01:42:57,111 --> 01:42:59,647
Oh, yeah, that's right, I keep forgetting.

1847
01:43:00,357 --> 01:43:03,984
- Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
- Oh, tut, tut, tut.

1848
01:43:05,028 --> 01:43:07,279
I found it out a little late.

1849
01:43:07,656 --> 01:43:09,691
I'm worth more dead than alive.

1850
01:43:09,791 --> 01:43:13,945
Now, look, you mustn't talk like that.
I won't get my wings with that attitude.

1851
01:43:14,045 --> 01:43:17,699
You just don't know all that you've done.
If it hadn't been for you...

1852
01:43:17,799 --> 01:43:20,493
Yeah, if it hadn't been for me,
everybody'd be a lot better off.

1853
01:43:20,593 --> 01:43:22,787
My wife and my kids and my friends.

1854
01:43:22,887 --> 01:43:26,124
I mean, look, little fellow, go off
and haunt somebody else, will you?

1855
01:43:26,224 --> 01:43:28,876
No, now, you don't understand.
I've got my job...

1856
01:43:28,976 --> 01:43:30,803
Oh, shut up, will you?

1857
01:43:34,683 --> 01:43:37,393
Oh, this isn't gonna be so easy.

1858
01:43:42,315 --> 01:43:46,818
Yeah, so you still think killing yourself
would make everyone feel happier, eh?

1859
01:43:48,612 --> 01:43:51,406
Well, I don't know. I guess you're right.

1860
01:43:52,700 --> 01:43:55,569
I suppose it would have been better
if I'd never been born at all.

1861
01:43:55,669 --> 01:43:58,989
- What'd you say?
- I said I wish I'd never been born.

1862
01:43:59,089 --> 01:44:01,708
Oh, you mustn't say things like that.

1863
01:44:02,168 --> 01:44:06,755
You... Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
That's an idea.

1864
01:44:07,715 --> 01:44:09,382
What do you think?

1865
01:44:10,009 --> 01:44:11,801
Yeah, that'll do it.

1866
01:44:12,470 --> 01:44:13,803
All right.

1867
01:44:16,515 --> 01:44:19,726
You've got your wish.
You've never been born.

1868
01:44:25,316 --> 01:44:28,359
You don't have
to make all that fuss about it!

1869
01:44:29,236 --> 01:44:30,645
What did you say?

1870
01:44:30,745 --> 01:44:34,608
You've never been born. You don't exist.
You haven't a care in the world.

1871
01:44:34,708 --> 01:44:37,944
No worries, no obligations,
no $8,000 to get,

1872
01:44:38,044 --> 01:44:39,905
no Potter looking for you
with the Sheriff.

1873
01:44:40,005 --> 01:44:43,450
- Say something else in that ear.
- Sure, you can hear out of it.

1874
01:44:43,550 --> 01:44:45,660
Well, that's the doggonedest thing.

1875
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:48,288
I haven't heard anything out of that ear
since I was a kid.

1876
01:44:48,388 --> 01:44:50,540
Must have been that jump
in that cold water.

1877
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:53,384
Your lip stopped bleeding, too, George.

1878
01:44:58,057 --> 01:45:01,768
What do you know about that?
What's happening?

1879
01:45:03,229 --> 01:45:05,514
It stopped snowing out here, didn't it?

1880
01:45:05,614 --> 01:45:07,398
What's happened here?

1881
01:45:08,108 --> 01:45:10,018
What I need
is a couple of good stiff drinks.

1882
01:45:10,118 --> 01:45:12,403
How about you, Angel?
You want a drink?

1883
01:45:13,906 --> 01:45:16,149
Come on,
soon as these clothes of ours are dry...

1884
01:45:16,249 --> 01:45:18,193
The clothes are dry.

1885
01:45:18,293 --> 01:45:21,446
What do you know about that?
Stove's hotter than I thought.

1886
01:45:21,546 --> 01:45:25,659
Now, come on, get your clothes on.
We'll stroll up to my car and get...

1887
01:45:25,759 --> 01:45:27,911
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll stroll. You fly.

1888
01:45:28,011 --> 01:45:29,538
I can't fly. I haven't got my wings.

1889
01:45:29,638 --> 01:45:32,340
You haven't got your wings.
Yeah, that's right.

1890
01:45:37,972 --> 01:45:39,339
What's the matter?

1891
01:45:39,439 --> 01:45:42,133
Well, this is where I left my car,
and it isn't here.

1892
01:45:42,233 --> 01:45:45,511
- You have no car.
- Well, I had a car, and it was right here.

1893
01:45:45,611 --> 01:45:47,137
I guess somebody moved it.

1894
01:45:47,237 --> 01:45:51,316
- Good evening.
- Oh, say, hey, where's my car?

1895
01:45:51,568 --> 01:45:53,686
- I beg your pardon?
- My car, my car.

1896
01:45:53,786 --> 01:45:56,021
I'm the fellow that owns the car
that ran into your tree.

1897
01:45:56,121 --> 01:45:58,148
- What tree?
- What do you mean, what tree?

1898
01:45:58,248 --> 01:46:00,317
This tree. Here, I ran into it.

1899
01:46:00,417 --> 01:46:03,620
Cut a big gash in the side of it there.

1900
01:46:07,959 --> 01:46:11,412
You must mean two other trees.
You had me worried.

1901
01:46:11,512 --> 01:46:13,706
One of the oldest trees in Pottersville.

1902
01:46:13,806 --> 01:46:14,957
Pottersville?

1903
01:46:15,057 --> 01:46:16,667
Why, you mean Bedford Falls.

1904
01:46:16,767 --> 01:46:20,304
I mean Pottersville.
Don't you think I know where I live?

1905
01:46:20,471 --> 01:46:22,548
What's the matter with you?

1906
01:46:22,648 --> 01:46:25,851
What's the matter with me?
Well, I guess I just...

1907
01:46:28,438 --> 01:46:32,733
Oh, I don't know.
Either I'm off my nut or he is or you are.

1908
01:46:33,735 --> 01:46:35,060
It isn't me.

1909
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:37,187
Well, maybe I left the car
up at Martini's.

1910
01:46:37,287 --> 01:46:39,607
- Well, come on, Gabriel.
- Clarence.

1911
01:46:39,707 --> 01:46:41,491
Clarence. Clarence.

1912
01:46:46,956 --> 01:46:50,792
That's all right. Go on in.
Martini is a friend of mine.

1913
01:46:51,169 --> 01:46:53,837
There's a place to sit down. Sit down.

1914
01:47:00,178 --> 01:47:03,714
- Oh, hello, Nick. Hey, where's Martini?
- Want a martini?

1915
01:47:03,814 --> 01:47:05,841
No, no, Martini. Your boss.
Where is he?

1916
01:47:05,941 --> 01:47:08,344
Hey, look, I'm the boss.
You want a drink or don't you?

1917
01:47:08,444 --> 01:47:10,638
Okay, all right. Double bourbon,
will you, and quick, huh?

1918
01:47:10,738 --> 01:47:11,980
Okay.

1919
01:47:15,109 --> 01:47:18,195
- What's yours?
- I was just thinking.

1920
01:47:19,364 --> 01:47:21,774
It's been so long since I...

1921
01:47:21,874 --> 01:47:25,527
Look, mister, I'm standing here
waiting for you to make up your mind.

1922
01:47:25,627 --> 01:47:27,237
That's a good man.

1923
01:47:27,337 --> 01:47:29,498
I was just thinking

1924
01:47:30,375 --> 01:47:33,543
of a flaming rum punch.

1925
01:47:33,878 --> 01:47:36,413
No, it's not cold enough for that,
not nearly cold enough.

1926
01:47:36,513 --> 01:47:39,458
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I got it.

1927
01:47:39,558 --> 01:47:43,128
Mulled wine, heavy on the cinnamon
and light on the cloves.

1928
01:47:43,228 --> 01:47:45,129
Off with you, me lad, and be lively!

1929
01:47:45,229 --> 01:47:48,257
Hey, look, mister,
we serve hard drinks in here

1930
01:47:48,357 --> 01:47:50,134
for men who want to get drunk fast.

1931
01:47:50,234 --> 01:47:53,763
And we don't need any characters
around to give the joint atmosphere.

1932
01:47:53,863 --> 01:47:57,475
Is that clear, or do I have
to slip you my left for a convincer?

1933
01:47:57,575 --> 01:47:58,935
What's he talking about?

1934
01:47:59,035 --> 01:48:02,897
Nick, Nick,
just give him the same as mine.

1935
01:48:02,997 --> 01:48:05,324
- He's okay.
- Okay.

1936
01:48:06,743 --> 01:48:10,321
What's the matter with him?
I never saw Nick act like that before.

1937
01:48:10,421 --> 01:48:13,541
You'll see a lot of strange things
from now on.

1938
01:48:13,792 --> 01:48:15,584
Oh, yeah.

1939
01:48:18,755 --> 01:48:22,375
Hey, little fellow,
you worry me, you know.

1940
01:48:22,475 --> 01:48:25,420
- You got someplace to sleep?
- No.

1941
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:27,046
You don't, huh?

1942
01:48:27,146 --> 01:48:29,765
- Well, you got any money?
- No.

1943
01:48:30,726 --> 01:48:32,343
No wonder you jumped in the river.

1944
01:48:32,443 --> 01:48:36,105
I jumped in the river to save you
so I could get my wings.

1945
01:48:39,943 --> 01:48:42,061
- Somebody's just made it.
- Made what?

1946
01:48:42,161 --> 01:48:46,949
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means
that some angel's just got his wings.

1947
01:48:54,833 --> 01:48:57,577
Look, I think maybe you
better not mention

1948
01:48:57,677 --> 01:48:59,037
getting your wings around here.

1949
01:48:59,137 --> 01:49:01,547
Why? Don't they believe in angels?

1950
01:49:04,134 --> 01:49:05,960
Yeah, they believe in them.

1951
01:49:06,060 --> 01:49:09,346
Oh, why should they be surprised
when they see one?

1952
01:49:11,141 --> 01:49:14,393
Oh, he never grew up. He's...

1953
01:49:14,811 --> 01:49:18,814
- How old are you anyway, Clarence?
- Two hundred and ninety-three,

1954
01:49:21,026 --> 01:49:22,318
next May.

1955
01:49:22,903 --> 01:49:25,521
That does it. Out, you two pixies!

1956
01:49:25,621 --> 01:49:27,565
Go through the door or out the window.

1957
01:49:27,665 --> 01:49:29,734
- Look, Nick, what's wrong?
- Now, that's another thing.

1958
01:49:29,834 --> 01:49:31,778
Where do you come off
calling me Nick?

1959
01:49:31,878 --> 01:49:33,362
Well, Nick, that's your name.

1960
01:49:33,462 --> 01:49:37,575
What's that got to do with it?
I don't know you from Adam's off ox.

1961
01:49:37,675 --> 01:49:40,544
Hey. Hey, you rummy, there.
Come here, come here.

1962
01:49:44,007 --> 01:49:47,592
Didn't I tell you never to come
panhandling around here, huh?

1963
01:49:54,683 --> 01:49:56,017
Mr. Gower.

1964
01:49:57,269 --> 01:49:58,603
Mr. Gower.

1965
01:50:00,231 --> 01:50:01,981
What... What did...

1966
01:50:02,358 --> 01:50:04,776
Mr. Gower, look, this is George Bailey.

1967
01:50:06,153 --> 01:50:08,279
- Don't you know me?
- No.

1968
01:50:09,865 --> 01:50:11,066
No.

1969
01:50:11,166 --> 01:50:12,609
Throw him out. Throw him out.

1970
01:50:12,709 --> 01:50:14,702
Mr. Gower! Hey, what is...

1971
01:50:15,871 --> 01:50:18,115
Hey, Nick. Nick.
Isn't that Mr. Gower, the druggist?

1972
01:50:18,215 --> 01:50:20,450
You know, that's another reason
for me not to like you.

1973
01:50:20,550 --> 01:50:23,954
That rum head spent 20 years in jail
for poisoning a kid.

1974
01:50:24,054 --> 01:50:26,915
If you know him,
you must be a jailbird yourself.

1975
01:50:27,015 --> 01:50:29,042
Would you show these gentlemen
to the door?

1976
01:50:29,142 --> 01:50:31,177
Sure. This way, gentlemen.

1977
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:37,892
Stay out.

1978
01:50:39,061 --> 01:50:41,646
Get me! I'm giving out wings!

1979
01:50:44,316 --> 01:50:46,810
You see, George,
you were not there to stop Gower

1980
01:50:46,910 --> 01:50:48,603
from putting that poison
into the capsules.

1981
01:50:48,703 --> 01:50:52,365
What do you mean, I wasn't there?
I remember distinctly...

1982
01:50:54,577 --> 01:50:56,995
Hey, what's going on around here?

1983
01:50:57,246 --> 01:50:58,621
What...

1984
01:50:59,748 --> 01:51:02,417
Why, this ought to be Martini's place.

1985
01:51:08,299 --> 01:51:09,966
Look, who are you?

1986
01:51:10,217 --> 01:51:12,752
I told you, George.
I'm your guardian angel.

1987
01:51:12,852 --> 01:51:15,096
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that.

1988
01:51:20,686 --> 01:51:23,930
What else are you?
What, are you a hypnotist?

1989
01:51:24,030 --> 01:51:25,182
No. Of course not.

1990
01:51:25,282 --> 01:51:27,851
Well, then, why am I seeing
all these strange things here?

1991
01:51:27,951 --> 01:51:32,355
Don't you understand, George?
It's because you were not born.

1992
01:51:32,455 --> 01:51:36,735
- Well, if I wasn't born, who am I?
- You're nobody. You have no identity.

1993
01:51:36,835 --> 01:51:39,487
What do you mean, no identity?
My name's George Bailey.

1994
01:51:39,587 --> 01:51:41,623
There is no George Bailey.

1995
01:51:42,750 --> 01:51:47,085
You have no papers, no cards,
no driver's license,

1996
01:51:47,503 --> 01:51:50,255
no 4-F card, no insurance policy.

1997
01:51:51,257 --> 01:51:53,258
They're not there, either.

1998
01:51:54,469 --> 01:51:56,803
- What?
- Zuzu's petals.

1999
01:52:02,310 --> 01:52:05,020
You've been given a great gift, George,

2000
01:52:05,188 --> 01:52:08,815
a chance to see what the world
would be like without you.

2001
01:52:11,152 --> 01:52:13,779
Now, wait a minute here.
Wait a minute here.

2002
01:52:15,657 --> 01:52:18,992
This is some sort of a funny dream
I'm having.

2003
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:20,945
So long, mister. I'm going home.

2004
01:52:21,045 --> 01:52:23,914
- Home? What home?
- Shut up! Cut it out!

2005
01:52:24,415 --> 01:52:28,460
You're crazy!
That's what I think. You're screwy.

2006
01:52:28,878 --> 01:52:31,580
You're driving me crazy, too.
I'm seeing things here.

2007
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:33,582
I'm going home
and see my wife and family.

2008
01:52:33,682 --> 01:52:36,843
You understand that?
And I'm going home alone.

2009
01:52:39,222 --> 01:52:41,139
How am I doing, Joseph?

2010
01:52:41,849 --> 01:52:43,058
Thanks.

2011
01:52:43,393 --> 01:52:45,477
No, I didn't have a drink.

2012
01:53:36,696 --> 01:53:39,231
Hey, hey, where did
the Building and Loan move to?

2013
01:53:39,331 --> 01:53:40,316
Building and what?

2014
01:53:40,416 --> 01:53:42,151
The Bailey Building and Loan.
It was up there.

2015
01:53:42,251 --> 01:53:44,111
They went out of business years ago.

2016
01:53:44,211 --> 01:53:45,570
That sailor's a liar!

2017
01:53:45,670 --> 01:53:47,947
I know every big shot in this town!

2018
01:53:48,047 --> 01:53:50,575
I know Potter,
and I'll have you kicked off the beat.

2019
01:53:50,675 --> 01:53:52,126
Hey, Violet!

2020
01:53:53,337 --> 01:53:55,913
Hey, hey! Listen. That's Violet Bick.

2021
01:53:56,013 --> 01:53:58,124
- I know.
- I know that girl!

2022
01:53:58,224 --> 01:54:00,009
Take a walk. Beat it.

2023
01:54:02,012 --> 01:54:03,763
Hey, Ernie! Ernie.

2024
01:54:05,932 --> 01:54:07,842
Ernie, take me home.
I'm going off my nut.

2025
01:54:07,942 --> 01:54:08,926
Where do you live?

2026
01:54:09,026 --> 01:54:11,095
Now, doggone it, Ernie,
don't you start pulling that stuff.

2027
01:54:11,195 --> 01:54:13,681
You know where I live. 320 Sycamore.
Now hurry up.

2028
01:54:13,781 --> 01:54:17,226
- All right. 320 Sycamore?
- Yeah, yeah, hurry up. Zuzu's sick.

2029
01:54:17,326 --> 01:54:19,153
- Come on.
- All right. All right.

2030
01:54:19,780 --> 01:54:21,814
Come on, Ernie,
now straighten me out here.

2031
01:54:21,914 --> 01:54:24,901
Look, I've got some bad liquor
or something. Listen to me.

2032
01:54:25,001 --> 01:54:26,194
Now, you are Ernie Bishop,

2033
01:54:26,294 --> 01:54:28,029
and you live in Bailey Park
with your wife and kid?

2034
01:54:28,129 --> 01:54:30,156
- That's right, isn't it?
- You seen my wife?

2035
01:54:30,256 --> 01:54:33,493
Seen your wife?
I've been to your house 100 times.

2036
01:54:33,593 --> 01:54:36,371
Look, bud, what's the idea?
I live in a shack in Potter's Field,

2037
01:54:36,471 --> 01:54:38,498
my wife ran away three years ago
and took the kid,

2038
01:54:38,598 --> 01:54:41,042
and I ain't never seen you
before in my life, see?

2039
01:54:41,142 --> 01:54:43,928
Okay, well, just step on it.
Just get me home!

2040
01:55:01,446 --> 01:55:03,731
- Is this the place?
- Of course it's the place.

2041
01:55:03,831 --> 01:55:07,034
Well, this house ain't been lived in
for 20 years.

2042
01:55:13,083 --> 01:55:15,076
- What's up, Ernie?
- I don't know.

2043
01:55:15,176 --> 01:55:18,337
But we better keep our eye on this guy.
He's bats.

2044
01:55:35,814 --> 01:55:38,023
Mary. Mary!

2045
01:55:40,986 --> 01:55:43,863
Tommy! Pete! Janie! Zuzu!
Where are you?

2046
01:55:44,322 --> 01:55:46,940
They're not here, George.
You have no children.

2047
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:48,442
Where are they?
What have you done with them?

2048
01:55:48,542 --> 01:55:50,694
All right, put up your hands.
No fast moves.

2049
01:55:50,794 --> 01:55:52,362
Come on out here, both of you.

2050
01:55:52,462 --> 01:55:54,781
- Bert! Thank heaven you're here.
- Back this.

2051
01:55:54,881 --> 01:55:58,118
Bert, what's happened to this house?
Where's Mary? Where's my kids?

2052
01:55:58,218 --> 01:55:59,870
- Watch him, Bert.
- Come on, come on.

2053
01:55:59,970 --> 01:56:01,997
Bert, Ernie.
What's the matter with you two guys?

2054
01:56:02,097 --> 01:56:03,582
You were here on my wedding night.

2055
01:56:03,682 --> 01:56:05,292
You, both of you,
stood out there on the porch

2056
01:56:05,392 --> 01:56:07,669
- and sung to us, don't you remember?
- Think I'd better be going.

2057
01:56:07,769 --> 01:56:09,087
Look, now, why don't you be a good kid,

2058
01:56:09,187 --> 01:56:10,297
and we'll take you in to a doctor?

2059
01:56:10,397 --> 01:56:12,340
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- Bert, no, listen to me.

2060
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:14,301
Ernie, will you take me over
to my mother's house?

2061
01:56:14,401 --> 01:56:16,845
Bert, listen. It's that fellow here.
He says he's an angel.

2062
01:56:16,945 --> 01:56:20,398
- He's trying to hypnotize me.
- I hate to do this to you, bud, but...

2063
01:56:21,734 --> 01:56:24,444
Run, George! Run, George! Run!

2064
01:56:26,155 --> 01:56:28,948
- Joseph! Help! Help!
- Oh, shut up.

2065
01:56:29,074 --> 01:56:31,910
Oh, Joseph! Joseph!

2066
01:56:37,708 --> 01:56:41,002
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?
I had him right here.

2067
01:56:43,756 --> 01:56:45,298
I need a drink.

2068
01:56:45,758 --> 01:56:48,426
Well, which way did he go?
Help me find him.

2069
01:56:58,312 --> 01:56:59,437
Well?

2070
01:57:02,691 --> 01:57:03,900
Mother.

2071
01:57:05,903 --> 01:57:07,946
Mother? What do you want?

2072
01:57:09,114 --> 01:57:11,783
Mother, this is George.

2073
01:57:12,117 --> 01:57:13,902
I thought sure you'd remember me.

2074
01:57:14,002 --> 01:57:15,403
George who?

2075
01:57:15,503 --> 01:57:17,364
If you're looking for a room,
there's no vacancy.

2076
01:57:17,464 --> 01:57:20,784
Mother, listen. Please help me.
Something terrible's happened to me.

2077
01:57:20,884 --> 01:57:23,286
I don't know what it is.
Something's happened to everybody.

2078
01:57:23,386 --> 01:57:26,331
Please let me come in,
and keep me here until I get over it.

2079
01:57:26,431 --> 01:57:28,750
Get over what? I don't take in strangers

2080
01:57:28,850 --> 01:57:31,386
unless they're sent here
by somebody I know.

2081
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:36,716
Well, I know everybody you know.
Your brother-in-law, Uncle Billy.

2082
01:57:36,816 --> 01:57:38,510
- You know him?
- Well, sure I do.

2083
01:57:38,610 --> 01:57:40,720
- When did you see him last?
- Today over at his house.

2084
01:57:40,820 --> 01:57:41,930
It's a lie.

2085
01:57:42,030 --> 01:57:44,891
He's been in the insane asylum
ever since he lost his business.

2086
01:57:44,991 --> 01:57:47,859
And if you ask me,
that's where you belong.

2087
01:57:59,789 --> 01:58:01,456
Strange, isn't it?

2088
01:58:01,916 --> 01:58:04,835
Each man's life
touches so many other lives.

2089
01:58:05,295 --> 01:58:08,247
And when he isn't around,
he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he?

2090
01:58:08,347 --> 01:58:09,498
I've heard of things like this.

2091
01:58:09,598 --> 01:58:11,333
You got me in some kind of a spell
or something.

2092
01:58:11,433 --> 01:58:13,502
Well, I'm gonna get out of it.
I'll get out of it.

2093
01:58:13,602 --> 01:58:15,387
I know how, too. I...

2094
01:58:15,805 --> 01:58:16,922
The last man I talked to,

2095
01:58:17,022 --> 01:58:19,174
before all this stuff
started happening to me, was Martini.

2096
01:58:19,274 --> 01:58:20,467
You know where he lives?

2097
01:58:20,567 --> 01:58:23,478
Well, sure, I know where he lives.
He lives in Bailey Park.

2098
01:58:27,066 --> 01:58:31,528
- Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
- No, I'm not sure of anything anymore.

2099
01:58:32,405 --> 01:58:35,240
All I know is this should be Bailey Park.

2100
01:58:36,034 --> 01:58:39,786
- But where are the houses?
- You weren't here to build them.

2101
01:58:44,375 --> 01:58:47,369
Your brother Harry Bailey
broke through the ice

2102
01:58:47,469 --> 01:58:49,330
and was drowned at the age of nine.

2103
01:58:49,430 --> 01:58:51,498
That's a lie. Harry Bailey went to war.

2104
01:58:51,598 --> 01:58:53,042
He got the Congressional
Medal of Honor.

2105
01:58:53,142 --> 01:58:55,085
He saved the lives
of every man on that transport.

2106
01:58:55,185 --> 01:58:57,212
Every man on that transport died.

2107
01:58:57,312 --> 01:58:58,631
Harry wasn't there to save them,

2108
01:58:58,731 --> 01:59:01,433
because you weren't there
to save Harry.

2109
01:59:12,612 --> 01:59:16,156
You see, George?
You really had a wonderful life.

2110
01:59:16,616 --> 01:59:20,702
Don't you see what a mistake
it would be to throw it away?

2111
01:59:21,371 --> 01:59:23,288
- Clarence.
- Yes, George?

2112
01:59:24,290 --> 01:59:27,493
- Where's Mary?
- Oh, well, I can't...

2113
01:59:27,593 --> 01:59:30,120
I don't know how you know these things,
but tell me, where is she?

2114
01:59:30,220 --> 01:59:32,164
If you know where she is,
tell me where my wife is.

2115
01:59:32,264 --> 01:59:35,250
- I'm not supposed to tell.
- Please, Clarence, tell me where she is.

2116
01:59:35,350 --> 01:59:37,670
- You're not gonna like it, George.
- Where is she?

2117
01:59:37,770 --> 01:59:40,089
She's an old maid. She never married.

2118
01:59:40,189 --> 01:59:42,508
Where is Mary? Where is she?
Where is she?

2119
01:59:42,608 --> 01:59:45,519
She's just about to close up the library!

2120
01:59:49,398 --> 01:59:52,775
There must be some easier way
for me to get my wings.

2121
02:00:04,287 --> 02:00:05,413
Mary!

2122
02:00:11,044 --> 02:00:12,128
Mary!

2123
02:00:14,548 --> 02:00:15,673
Mary!

2124
02:00:17,092 --> 02:00:18,634
Mary! Mary!

2125
02:00:18,802 --> 02:00:21,546
Mary, it's George. Don't you know me?
What's happened to us?

2126
02:00:21,646 --> 02:00:22,964
I don't know you. Let me go!

2127
02:00:23,064 --> 02:00:26,092
Mary, please! Oh, don't do this to me.
Please, Mary, help me.

2128
02:00:26,192 --> 02:00:28,352
Where's our kids? I need you, Mary.

2129
02:00:29,020 --> 02:00:30,813
Help me, Mary!

2130
02:00:31,064 --> 02:00:32,690
Mary! Let me go!

2131
02:00:32,983 --> 02:00:34,692
Help! It's a wild man!

2132
02:00:35,944 --> 02:00:38,604
The wild man is chasing me.
Somebody stop him!

2133
02:00:38,704 --> 02:00:41,282
Tom! Ed! Charlie!

2134
02:00:41,992 --> 02:00:43,325
That's my wife!

2135
02:00:45,871 --> 02:00:47,405
- Mary!
- No, you don't.

2136
02:00:47,505 --> 02:00:48,573
Somebody call the police.

2137
02:00:48,673 --> 02:00:49,991
Somebody hit him on the head
with a bottle.

2138
02:00:50,091 --> 02:00:52,209
You need a straightjacket.

2139
02:00:53,336 --> 02:00:54,628
Clarence!

2140
02:00:55,088 --> 02:00:56,664
Get out of here!

2141
02:00:56,764 --> 02:00:58,007
Clarence!

2142
02:00:59,718 --> 02:01:02,178
- Clarence!
- Right, that's you!

2143
02:01:05,307 --> 02:01:06,682
Stand back!

2144
02:01:10,395 --> 02:01:11,687
Clarence!

2145
02:01:20,864 --> 02:01:22,156
Clarence!

2146
02:01:27,078 --> 02:01:29,330
Clarence! Clarence!

2147
02:01:30,957 --> 02:01:32,666
Help me, Clarence!

2148
02:01:33,794 --> 02:01:35,211
Get me back!

2149
02:01:36,046 --> 02:01:39,006
Get me back.
I don't care what happens to me.

2150
02:01:39,382 --> 02:01:41,717
Get me back to my wife and kids.

2151
02:01:41,885 --> 02:01:43,969
Help me, Clarence, please.

2152
02:01:44,471 --> 02:01:49,098
Please. I want to live again.
I want to live again.

2153
02:01:50,851 --> 02:01:54,854
I want to live again.
Please, God, let me live again.

2154
02:02:03,906 --> 02:02:05,323
Hey, George!

2155
02:02:06,742 --> 02:02:07,909
George!

2156
02:02:08,953 --> 02:02:10,987
You all right. Hey, what's the matter?

2157
02:02:11,087 --> 02:02:13,490
Now get out of here, Bert,
or I'll hit you again! Get out of here!

2158
02:02:13,590 --> 02:02:15,325
What the sam hill
are you yelling for, George?

2159
02:02:15,425 --> 02:02:16,918
You...

2160
02:02:18,254 --> 02:02:21,130
George? Bert, do you know me?

2161
02:02:21,465 --> 02:02:23,458
Know you? You kidding?

2162
02:02:23,558 --> 02:02:25,669
I've been looking all over town
trying to find you.

2163
02:02:25,769 --> 02:02:28,713
I saw your car piled into that tree
down there, and I thought maybe you...

2164
02:02:28,813 --> 02:02:31,049
Hey, your mouth's bleeding.
Are you sure you're all right?

2165
02:02:31,149 --> 02:02:32,642
What did...

2166
02:02:36,522 --> 02:02:39,691
My mouth's bleeding, Bert!
My mouth's...

2167
02:02:39,942 --> 02:02:43,019
Zuzu's petals. Zuzu... There they are!

2168
02:02:43,119 --> 02:02:46,022
Bert! What do you know about that?

2169
02:02:46,122 --> 02:02:49,868
- Merry Christmas!
- Well, Merry Christmas.

2170
02:02:50,286 --> 02:02:53,413
Mary! Mary!

2171
02:03:02,047 --> 02:03:04,048
Hello, Bedford Falls!

2172
02:03:07,052 --> 02:03:08,420
Merry Christmas!

2173
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:10,338
- Merry Christmas, George!
- Merry Christmas!

2174
02:03:10,438 --> 02:03:12,299
Merry Christmas, George.

2175
02:03:12,399 --> 02:03:14,809
Merry Christmas, movie house!

2176
02:03:15,352 --> 02:03:17,645
Merry Christmas, emporium!

2177
02:03:18,898 --> 02:03:22,609
Merry Christmas,
you wonderful old Building and Loan!

2178
02:03:26,822 --> 02:03:30,400
Hey, Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!

2179
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:33,194
Happy New Year to you in jail!

2180
02:03:33,294 --> 02:03:35,330
Go on home. They're waiting for you.

2181
02:03:36,916 --> 02:03:39,918
Mary! Mary!

2182
02:03:41,629 --> 02:03:42,712
Mary!

2183
02:03:43,631 --> 02:03:46,458
Well, hello, Mr. Bank Examiner!
How are you?

2184
02:03:46,558 --> 02:03:48,751
- Mr. Bailey, there's a deficit.
- I know, $8,000.

2185
02:03:48,851 --> 02:03:50,294
George, I've got a little paper here.

2186
02:03:50,394 --> 02:03:51,670
I'll bet it's a warrant for my arrest.

2187
02:03:51,770 --> 02:03:53,422
Isn't it wonderful? I'm going to jail!

2188
02:03:53,522 --> 02:03:55,883
Merry Christmas! Reporters?
Where's Mary?

2189
02:03:55,983 --> 02:03:58,761
Mary! Oh, look at this wonderful,
old drafty house.

2190
02:03:58,861 --> 02:04:01,146
Mary! Mary!

2191
02:04:02,398 --> 02:04:03,523
Mary.

2192
02:04:04,275 --> 02:04:05,935
Have you seen my wife?

2193
02:04:06,035 --> 02:04:08,896
Merry Christmas, Daddy.

2194
02:04:08,996 --> 02:04:11,031
Kids! Pete!

2195
02:04:15,703 --> 02:04:16,946
Kids! Janie!

2196
02:04:17,046 --> 02:04:18,538
Janie! Tommy!

2197
02:04:20,667 --> 02:04:23,543
Let me look at you.
Oh, I could eat you up.

2198
02:04:24,295 --> 02:04:25,371
Where's your mother?

2199
02:04:25,471 --> 02:04:27,247
- She went looking for you.
- With Uncle Billy.

2200
02:04:27,347 --> 02:04:29,041
- Daddy!
- Zuzu!

2201
02:04:29,141 --> 02:04:31,669
Zuzu, my little gingersnap.
How do you feel?

2202
02:04:31,769 --> 02:04:35,055
- Fine! Not a smidge of temperature.
- Not a smidge of...

2203
02:04:35,723 --> 02:04:37,724
- Hallelujah!
- Hello.

2204
02:04:38,434 --> 02:04:41,595
- George! George, darling!
- Mary! Mary!

2205
02:04:41,695 --> 02:04:43,889
George, darling. Where have you been?

2206
02:04:43,989 --> 02:04:47,309
- Oh, George, George, George.
- Mary.

2207
02:04:47,409 --> 02:04:50,612
Let me touch you.
Let me touch you. Are you real?

2208
02:04:52,073 --> 02:04:54,191
George, George.

2209
02:04:54,291 --> 02:04:56,193
You have no idea
what's happened to me.

2210
02:04:56,293 --> 02:04:58,286
You've no idea what happened...

2211
02:04:59,163 --> 02:05:01,281
Well, come on, George.
Come on downstairs, quick.

2212
02:05:01,381 --> 02:05:02,700
- They're on their way.
- All right.

2213
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:04,042
Come on.

2214
02:05:06,421 --> 02:05:08,213
Come on in here now.

2215
02:05:09,382 --> 02:05:11,000
Now, you stand right over here
by the tree.

2216
02:05:11,100 --> 02:05:13,335
Right there, and don't move.
Don't move.

2217
02:05:13,435 --> 02:05:15,012
What's happening?
Who's gonna come?

2218
02:05:15,430 --> 02:05:16,755
I hear them coming now.

2219
02:05:16,855 --> 02:05:19,258
George, it's a miracle. It's a miracle.

2220
02:05:19,358 --> 02:05:21,552
- What's happening?
- What's happening?

2221
02:05:21,652 --> 02:05:23,637
- Who's gonna come, Daddy?
- Who, Daddy?

2222
02:05:23,737 --> 02:05:27,349
Come in, Uncle Billy.
Everybody, in here.

2223
02:05:27,449 --> 02:05:28,692
George.

2224
02:05:30,153 --> 02:05:32,404
Here's everything right here.

2225
02:05:33,698 --> 02:05:37,317
Isn't it wonderful? So many friends.
Mary did it, George! Mary did it!

2226
02:05:37,417 --> 02:05:38,986
She told some people
you were in trouble,

2227
02:05:39,086 --> 02:05:41,030
and they scattered all over town
collecting money.

2228
02:05:41,130 --> 02:05:42,197
Didn't ask any questions.

2229
02:05:42,297 --> 02:05:43,991
Just said,
"George in trouble? Then count me in."

2230
02:05:44,091 --> 02:05:45,784
- What is this...
- You never saw anything like it.

2231
02:05:45,884 --> 02:05:47,994
...another run on the bank?

2232
02:05:48,094 --> 02:05:50,538
Here you are, George. Merry Christmas.

2233
02:05:50,638 --> 02:05:52,623
Now, don't crowd. Don't push.
There we are.

2234
02:05:52,723 --> 02:05:54,884
The line forms on the right.

2235
02:05:55,218 --> 02:05:56,878
More coming, George.

2236
02:05:56,978 --> 02:05:59,472
Merry Christmas, and God bless you.

2237
02:06:00,515 --> 02:06:02,141
Merry Christmas.

2238
02:06:02,476 --> 02:06:04,886
- Oh, Mr. Martini!
- Merry Christmas.

2239
02:06:04,986 --> 02:06:07,480
Martini! Step right up here.

2240
02:06:08,190 --> 02:06:10,649
I busted the jukebox, too.

2241
02:06:13,820 --> 02:06:15,321
Oh, Mr. Gower!

2242
02:06:17,574 --> 02:06:20,326
I made the rounds
of my charge accounts.

2243
02:06:28,168 --> 02:06:31,212
I'm not gonna go, George.
I changed my mind.

2244
02:06:31,505 --> 02:06:32,963
Violet Bick.

2245
02:06:33,715 --> 02:06:35,424
Oh, Annie! Annie!

2246
02:06:36,635 --> 02:06:38,920
I've been saving this money
for a divorce,

2247
02:06:39,020 --> 02:06:41,013
if ever I get a husband.

2248
02:06:42,307 --> 02:06:43,474
Merry Christmas.

2249
02:06:45,685 --> 02:06:49,013
There you are, George.
I got the faculty all up and out of bed.

2250
02:06:49,113 --> 02:06:51,398
Here's something for you to play with.

2251
02:06:52,901 --> 02:06:56,062
I wouldn't have a roof over my head
if it wasn't for you, George.

2252
02:06:56,162 --> 02:06:59,649
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Quiet, everybody. Quiet, quiet.

2253
02:06:59,749 --> 02:07:01,951
Now, get this, it's from London.

2254
02:07:02,869 --> 02:07:05,454
"Mr. Gower cabled you need cash. Stop.

2255
02:07:05,664 --> 02:07:09,951
"My office instructed
to advance you up to $25,000. Stop.

2256
02:07:10,051 --> 02:07:13,045
"Hee-haw and Merry Christmas.
Sam Wainwright."

2257
02:07:23,265 --> 02:07:25,724
And Mr. Martini. How about some wine?

Harry. Harry.

2269
02:08:16,942 --> 02:08:18,101
Looks like I got here too late.

2270
02:08:18,201 --> 02:08:20,812
Mary, I got him here from the airport
just as quick as I could.

The fool flew all the way up here

2272
02:08:22,789 --> 02:08:24,524
Harry, how about your banquet
in New York?

2273
02:08:24,624 --> 02:08:27,235
Oh, I left right in the middle of it
as soon as I got Mary's telegram.

2274
02:08:27,335 --> 02:08:29,321
Good idea, Ernie. A toast
