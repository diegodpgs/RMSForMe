1
00:00:49,162 --> 00:00:50,959
CITY OF GOD

2
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:57,759
Fuck, the chicken's got away!
Go after that chicken, man!

3
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:02,562
Go on, for fuck's sake!

4
00:02:06,673 --> 00:02:08,800
Get that chicken!

5
00:02:22,756 --> 00:02:25,452
If it's a good photo,
I'll get a job at the paper.

6
00:02:25,658 --> 00:02:27,819
- You think so, Rocket?
- Gotta take the risk.

7
00:02:28,027 --> 00:02:32,657
You'd risk your life
for a picture? Forget it!

8
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:36,566
You think I want to meet up
with that motherfucking hood?

9
00:02:37,604 --> 00:02:41,472
Get that chicken, bro!

10
00:02:43,743 --> 00:02:46,769
Motherfucker! I told you
to grab that chicken!

11
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,107
Outta my way!

12
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:51,317
Get that chicken!

13
00:03:10,937 --> 00:03:12,666
If Li'l Z' catches you,
he'll kill you.

14
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,305
Yeah, well,
he's gotta find me first.

15
00:03:26,252 --> 00:03:29,881
Hey, kid! Get that chicken!
Get that chicken!

16
00:03:32,425 --> 00:03:33,756
Shit! The cops!

17
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,224
Don't fucking run off!

18
00:03:36,429 --> 00:03:38,226
Give me that.

19
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,301
Hey, Melonhead! You fucking fag!

20
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,861
A picture could change
my life, but...

21
00:03:47,073 --> 00:03:50,338
in the City of God, if you
run away, they get you...

22
00:03:50,944 --> 00:03:54,402
...and if you stay, they get you too.
- They're coming for us!

23
00:03:54,614 --> 00:03:57,276
It's been that way
ever since I was a kid...

24
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:03,921
THE SIXTIES

25
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:12,263
You're useless, man!

26
00:04:12,465 --> 00:04:15,298
- Go get the ball!
- Fucking useless!

27
00:04:18,404 --> 00:04:19,598
Hey, kid!

28
00:04:19,806 --> 00:04:22,832
Give me the ball, I wanna play.

29
00:04:24,644 --> 00:04:28,171
- It's not yours.
- You wanna mess with me?

30
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:30,815
Fuck off.

31
00:04:31,017 --> 00:04:35,181
- What's your name?
- Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself.

32
00:04:35,388 --> 00:04:37,913
- My name's Rocket.
- Some advice, Rocket...

33
00:04:38,525 --> 00:04:41,688
Don't let Li'l Dice
touch that ball. He sucks.

34
00:04:42,195 --> 00:04:44,186
- You lose, pal.
- Go, Shaggy!

35
00:04:44,397 --> 00:04:46,627
That's Shaggy.

36
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:50,234
To tell the story of the City of God,
I have to start with him.

37
00:04:50,436 --> 00:04:52,461
8, 9, 10, 11...

38
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,143
But in order to tell Shaggy's story, I
must tell the story of the Tender Trio.

39
00:04:58,344 --> 00:05:02,542
Well, Shaggy? The gas truck's coming.
What are you fucking around for?

40
00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:04,683
You're not gonna chicken out...

41
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:11,548
THE STORY OF THE TENDER TRIO

42
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,688
The notorious Tender Trio
was legendary in the City of God.

43
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,458
Shaggy...

44
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:24,830
Clipper...

45
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:26,972
and Goose.

46
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:32,639
Tagging along were always
Li'l Dice and Benny...

47
00:05:32,845 --> 00:05:34,779
Shaggy's brother.

48
00:05:36,049 --> 00:05:39,712
I never had the courage
to follow my brother, Goose.

49
00:05:48,294 --> 00:05:50,262
Okay, let's go.

50
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,057
Come on, Goose.

51
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,823
Let's go!

52
00:06:04,811 --> 00:06:06,779
Stop! Stop!
Stop this fucker!

53
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:15,385
Stop or l'll shoot, motherfucker!

54
00:06:15,588 --> 00:06:17,886
Get out!

55
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:23,354
Hurry up, asshole!
Gimme the money!

56
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:26,224
Who wants gas?

57
00:06:34,807 --> 00:06:38,334
More! You wanna die for your
boss' damn money?

58
00:06:38,544 --> 00:06:40,535
Shitloads of money here!

59
00:06:42,682 --> 00:06:44,980
You see, asshole?

60
00:06:45,985 --> 00:06:47,145
Asshole!

61
00:06:47,353 --> 00:06:49,321
Fuck! The cops!

62
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,752
Let's get outta here!

63
00:06:58,798 --> 00:07:02,529
Clear out! The place is
crawling with cops!

64
00:07:18,317 --> 00:07:21,548
- Shaggy!
- The ball, Goose, it's yours!

65
00:07:31,464 --> 00:07:34,092
Back then, I thought
the guys in the Tender Trio...

66
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,461
were the most dangerous hoods
in Rio.

67
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:40,105
Here! Buy some new balls.

68
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:45,109
But they were just amateurs.

69
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,973
- Even my brother, Goose.
- Rocket, give this money to dad.

70
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,452
But don't tell him it's from me.

71
00:07:56,656 --> 00:07:58,886
Okay?

72
00:07:59,092 --> 00:08:02,084
- Hey, Stringy!
- Yeah?

73
00:08:02,295 --> 00:08:04,559
Look how much l've got.

74
00:08:20,046 --> 00:08:24,779
We came to the City of God
hoping to find paradise.

75
00:08:24,984 --> 00:08:29,648
Many families were homeless
due to flooding...

76
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:32,256
and acts of arson
in the ghettos.

77
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,393
- A light post!
- We'll have electricity!

78
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:37,756
The bigwigs in government
didn't joke around.

79
00:08:37,964 --> 00:08:40,899
Homeless? Off to City of God!

80
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,161
There was no electricity,
paved streets or transportation.

81
00:08:45,371 --> 00:08:48,568
But for the rich and powerful
our problems didn't matter.

82
00:08:48,808 --> 00:08:51,777
We were too far removed...

83
00:08:51,978 --> 00:08:54,446
from the picture postcard image
of Rio de Janeiro.

84
00:09:11,164 --> 00:09:13,894
Do you think I can become
a lifeguard one day?

85
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,931
I don't know.

86
00:09:16,135 --> 00:09:19,002
Being a lifeguard is better
than a fishmonger.

87
00:09:19,205 --> 00:09:21,730
I don't want to sell fish.
It stinks.

88
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:24,641
- Are you insulting your father?
- No.

89
00:09:25,378 --> 00:09:28,347
So what do you want to be?

90
00:09:28,748 --> 00:09:30,375
I don't know.

91
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:34,177
- Not a hood or a policeman.
- Why not?

92
00:09:34,387 --> 00:09:36,548
I'm scared of getting shot.

93
00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:43,495
Put that thing away, kid.
Are you nuts?

94
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:47,188
Pointing that gun at me?

95
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,631
Take it easy with the kid, Goose.
Li'l Dice is with me.

96
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:53,670
Right, I'm a gangster too.

97
00:09:53,873 --> 00:09:56,501
- That gas truck didn't bring much.
- So what?

98
00:09:56,709 --> 00:10:00,338
- We rob gas trucks every day.
- One today, another tomorrow.

99
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,841
No, we need to rob
some rich guy's house.

100
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:05,483
That's the only
way to get outta here.

101
00:10:05,685 --> 00:10:08,984
Hell, no. What you need
is to follow my plan.

102
00:10:09,188 --> 00:10:10,621
That's it.

103
00:10:10,823 --> 00:10:14,919
The little fart's getting
too big for his britches!

104
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:24,234
He gets high and starts
talking bullshit.

105
00:10:24,437 --> 00:10:29,602
You two junkies aren't worth
half as much as that kid.

106
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,470
What you got in mind, Li'l Dice?

107
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,276
To be a real hood you need
more than just a gun. You need ideas.

108
00:10:42,488 --> 00:10:44,581
And Li'l Dice had them.

109
00:10:45,758 --> 00:10:48,249
- Is that the motel?
- Yeah.

110
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:53,394
We go in, grab the money and
get out. No killing, got that?

111
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:56,932
- I need this.
- Don't touch my gun, kid.

112
00:10:57,136 --> 00:10:58,330
Don't ever do that again.

113
00:10:58,537 --> 00:11:00,129
- Don't point at me.
- Fuck you.

114
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:04,002
- Don't point your finger at me!
- Stop acting like a baby!

115
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,904
Here's yours.

116
00:11:06,112 --> 00:11:08,512
- Awesome!
- Let's go!

117
00:11:08,714 --> 00:11:11,239
- Not so fast!
- What?

118
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,918
You stay here and keep watch.

119
00:11:14,186 --> 00:11:19,488
If the cops come, shoot that
window over there.

120
00:11:19,692 --> 00:11:22,593
- Why me? Let that dork do that.
- Look...

121
00:11:22,795 --> 00:11:27,994
I gave you this great plan, for free...
While that guy's absolutely useless!

122
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,963
- You just had the idea.
- Exactly!

123
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:32,660
You're just a kid, remember?

124
00:11:33,272 --> 00:11:36,002
You cover us, okay?

125
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:41,776
You'll get your turn, so cool it.
Stop trying to rush things.

126
00:11:41,981 --> 00:11:44,472
You stay there.

127
00:11:48,287 --> 00:11:51,415
This is a hold-up, bitch.

128
00:11:54,527 --> 00:12:01,194
You should be studying or working.
You don't even look like hoodlums.

129
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,393
Instead, you ought to be
working or studying, boy.

130
00:12:05,604 --> 00:12:08,471
Shut up!
What a pain in the ass!

131
00:12:09,442 --> 00:12:11,205
Okay, Clipper?

132
00:12:13,245 --> 00:12:14,644
Shall we go in?

133
00:12:19,986 --> 00:12:22,250
I didn't order anything.

134
00:12:22,455 --> 00:12:26,585
It's on the house, sir.
Hand over the money!

135
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:29,056
Keep calm, all I want
is your cash.

136
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:30,853
- Don't point that...
- Your wallet...

137
00:12:43,275 --> 00:12:44,799
Hey, man...

138
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:47,206
What kind of whorehouse is this?

139
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:53,009
- You from the church?
- Yes, brother.

140
00:12:56,088 --> 00:12:57,077
Give it to me!

141
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,588
Slut!

142
00:13:00,826 --> 00:13:02,623
You're old, fat and flabby!

143
00:13:03,596 --> 00:13:05,894
Wanna take her place?

144
00:13:10,369 --> 00:13:12,530
What's going on?

145
00:13:13,672 --> 00:13:16,368
- The cops! Let's beat it!
- Let's go!

146
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:25,006
Take that car.
I'll go get Li'l Dice.

147
00:13:26,385 --> 00:13:28,819
Jesus, what a car!

148
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,561
- Something fucked up. Li'l Dice's gone.
- The cops are shooting, let's go!

149
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:08,992
Slow down! Hold on...

150
00:14:09,195 --> 00:14:12,028
- You said you knew how to drive.
- I do, so cool it!

151
00:14:12,231 --> 00:14:14,927
Turn! Watch out!

152
00:14:28,547 --> 00:14:30,310
You fucking asshole!

153
00:14:31,383 --> 00:14:34,079
Hey, I didn't do it on purpose.

154
00:14:34,286 --> 00:14:37,915
No one saw anything.
So keep your mouths shut, understand?

155
00:14:41,694 --> 00:14:44,595
Hold on, I twisted my ankle.

156
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:47,129
Goose fucked up his ankle.

157
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,322
It fucking hurts.

158
00:14:48,534 --> 00:14:52,436
Take him into the woods.
I'll shoot to distract the cops.

159
00:14:52,638 --> 00:14:54,970
- In God we trust.
- In God we trust.

160
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:02,143
Pass me the telephone, Penguin.

161
00:15:02,348 --> 00:15:06,250
Shorty is another notorious guy
in the City of God.

162
00:15:06,452 --> 00:15:08,477
But it's not yet time
to tell his story.

163
00:15:10,355 --> 00:15:14,382
- It fucking hurts, Goose.
- Shut up.

164
00:15:15,094 --> 00:15:19,827
- Wait up...
- You sound like a damn sissy, man.

165
00:15:23,902 --> 00:15:27,167
- Give me your hand! Climb up!
- No one saw anything?

166
00:15:27,372 --> 00:15:32,207
How odd! A car crashes
into a bar and no one saw a thing.

167
00:15:32,411 --> 00:15:35,403
I suppose you didn't see
anything either?

168
00:15:35,614 --> 00:15:39,345
As usual, no one saw,
no one knows.

169
00:15:40,085 --> 00:15:43,543
So what's up, Shorty?

170
00:15:44,223 --> 00:15:46,987
They're hiding in the woods.

171
00:15:47,993 --> 00:15:49,654
- Hello, Melonhead.
- How are you doing?

172
00:15:49,862 --> 00:15:53,298
I have this feeling that
they're out in the woods.

173
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:57,093
- The motherfuckers.
- They're out in the woods.

174
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:01,033
Felipe, lock up the car.
Rangel, come with me.

175
00:16:05,444 --> 00:16:08,709
I can't see a thing.
How the hell can they see?

176
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:11,348
Fucking jungle.

177
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:19,682
- They stole a fortune at that motel.
- I know.

178
00:16:22,027 --> 00:16:24,689
What if we took the money?

179
00:16:25,197 --> 00:16:29,361
Are you crazy?
I'm not getting mixed up in that.

180
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:32,128
I want to exterminate these guys.

181
00:16:32,337 --> 00:16:36,637
What? Since when is stealing from
niggers and thieves a crime?

182
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:43,642
It won't be hard to nab them.
I have a stoolie in the City.

183
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:15,174
- Did you hear those shots?
- If I catch one of them, I'll kill him.

184
00:17:26,925 --> 00:17:28,449
Maracana!

185
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,955
Open the door.

186
00:17:33,232 --> 00:17:36,963
- What's the matter?
- The cops are after me.

187
00:17:45,344 --> 00:17:46,743
Shaggy!

188
00:17:47,946 --> 00:17:50,813
- Shaggy!
- The cops are on my ass!

189
00:17:51,016 --> 00:17:54,247
- Hide me!
- Quick, come in.

190
00:18:02,094 --> 00:18:06,428
Shit... I thought the cops
would be down there all night.

191
00:18:07,766 --> 00:18:10,667
I had a vision, Goose.

192
00:18:11,403 --> 00:18:14,133
You been smoking something?

193
00:18:14,473 --> 00:18:17,306
- You've had a job, right?
- Yeah.

194
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:19,568
What's it like?
What do people say?

195
00:18:19,778 --> 00:18:21,905
I worked with my father.

196
00:18:22,114 --> 00:18:25,675
And fathers talk a lot of shit.

197
00:18:26,918 --> 00:18:30,945
You know what, Goose?
I'm getting out, I don't want to die.

198
00:18:31,156 --> 00:18:36,560
- This gangster's life isn't for me.
- Wait! The cops are still down there.

199
00:18:36,762 --> 00:18:39,424
I don't give a shit.

200
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,262
I'm going back to the church.

201
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,963
He that dwells in the secret
place of the most High...

202
00:18:47,172 --> 00:18:50,539
shall abide under the shadow of
the Almighty. I will say of the Lord...

203
00:18:50,742 --> 00:18:55,008
He is my refuge and my fortress,
in Him will I trust.

204
00:18:55,213 --> 00:18:58,444
Fear not the terror by night,
nor the arrow that flies by day...

205
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:02,677
nor the pestilence that walks
in darkness, nor the destruction...

206
00:19:02,888 --> 00:19:06,756
- Stop, motherfucker!
- Don't move!

207
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:10,528
Stop, or l'll shoot!

208
00:19:12,164 --> 00:19:17,192
...shall abide under the shadow
of the Almighty.

209
00:19:17,402 --> 00:19:22,169
The hold-up at the motel went down
as the bloodiest in history.

210
00:19:22,374 --> 00:19:25,207
The destinies of the outlaws
then took different paths.

211
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:28,846
I don't think this guy
was involved in the heist.

212
00:19:29,047 --> 00:19:30,742
See here?

213
00:19:30,949 --> 00:19:36,353
- He's a worker, not a hoodlum.
- I'll make him one now.

214
00:19:39,624 --> 00:19:43,924
Destiny put Clipper
back into the hands of God.

215
00:19:45,464 --> 00:19:49,628
Shaggy was in Bernice's hands.

216
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:54,796
And Goose was
in my father's hands.

217
00:19:55,006 --> 00:19:58,498
Why do you do these things?
You think l'm a fool?

218
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,406
From now on,
you'll work with me.

219
00:20:01,613 --> 00:20:05,777
Your younger brother
will keep an eye on you.

220
00:20:05,984 --> 00:20:07,975
You listen to me.

221
00:20:08,186 --> 00:20:12,555
If I catch you with money that
isn't yours, I'll kill you.

222
00:20:12,758 --> 00:20:18,628
That goes for you too. Get changed!
You start work immediately.

223
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:24,598
Having a hood as a brother sucks.
You always end up footing the bill.

224
00:20:24,803 --> 00:20:29,069
Don't worry.
Dad's mad at me...

225
00:20:29,274 --> 00:20:33,677
but he'll get over it.

226
00:20:36,815 --> 00:20:40,876
Give me that, Rocket. It's not
for you. You have to study.

227
00:20:41,086 --> 00:20:44,419
- Getting shot doesn't scare you?
- I'm a hood because I got no brain.

228
00:20:44,623 --> 00:20:48,457
But you're smart.
You should study.

229
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,259
I go to school because
I don't like physical work.

230
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:57,394
Promise me something... That you'll
never touch this gun. Promise?

231
00:20:58,136 --> 00:21:00,195
Let's shake.

232
00:21:01,706 --> 00:21:04,266
We'd better hurry.

233
00:21:05,544 --> 00:21:09,071
I'm gonna sell a lot of fish.
And don't laugh.

234
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:11,044
You grinned when I got slapped.

235
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:13,149
- Who, me?
- I saw you.

236
00:21:41,112 --> 00:21:44,604
What is it, Shaggy?
Cat got your tongue?

237
00:21:44,816 --> 00:21:47,410
Your fidgeting behind me
makes me nervous.

238
00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:51,783
- I'm thinking of what to say to you.
- You're thinking, as well?

239
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,322
Don't. It'll be your downfall.

240
00:21:54,526 --> 00:21:58,792
My heart has chosen you.
And I follow my heart.

241
00:21:58,997 --> 00:22:01,431
Are you pulling my leg?

242
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:04,796
You never heard of
love at first sight?

243
00:22:05,437 --> 00:22:10,431
- Hoods don't love, they desire.
- You cut down everything I say.

244
00:22:10,642 --> 00:22:14,339
Hoods don't talk,
they smooth-talk.

245
00:22:14,546 --> 00:22:17,879
Well, l'll stop wasting
my breath on you.

246
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:21,610
Hoods don't stop,
they take a break.

247
00:22:22,621 --> 00:22:25,112
Talking to you about love
sure is complicated.

248
00:22:25,323 --> 00:22:28,850
It's not love,
it's a con game.

249
00:22:45,143 --> 00:22:47,577
It's just that I love you.

250
00:22:48,613 --> 00:22:52,208
You just might end up
convincing me...

251
00:23:14,205 --> 00:23:19,199
After the hold-up, there were
constant police raids in the ghetto.

252
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:30,715
Every day, someone went to jail,
someone was nailed.

253
00:23:32,557 --> 00:23:36,618
But no one had seen anything.
No one knew anything.

254
00:23:38,029 --> 00:23:43,399
No one blabbed to the cops about
where the thieves were hiding out.

255
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,704
3 MONTHS LATER

256
00:23:47,906 --> 00:23:49,066
Shaggy...

257
00:23:49,274 --> 00:23:52,607
Why don't you change your life?

258
00:23:53,044 --> 00:23:56,775
Get a job instead of
lying around in bed all day.

259
00:23:56,982 --> 00:23:59,815
- Good-for-nothing!
- What do you mean?

260
00:24:00,018 --> 00:24:02,987
You think you can make money
working? Go ahead.

261
00:24:03,655 --> 00:24:08,058
That's right, Shaggy...
what do you think I do all day?

262
00:24:10,996 --> 00:24:17,128
Take it easy, baby... you know all
I want is to be with you, have kids...

263
00:24:17,335 --> 00:24:21,897
and a farm, raise chickens,
grow pot and get high.

264
00:24:22,107 --> 00:24:25,975
Sure! For me, that's
nothing but smooth-talk.

265
00:24:35,887 --> 00:24:40,153
What? I almost got
rich with that motel job.

266
00:24:40,358 --> 00:24:41,347
Are you kidding?

267
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:46,126
The cops are still looking for you
because of the deaths in the motel.

268
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:50,466
What deaths?
What are you talking about?

269
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:54,127
Did you see anything?
You don't know shit, so shut up.

270
00:24:54,339 --> 00:24:57,467
You weren't there.
I didn't kill anyone.

271
00:24:57,676 --> 00:25:01,373
I bet it's those fucking policemen,
and l'm the one taking the rap.

272
00:25:01,579 --> 00:25:05,208
They even nabbed Li'l Dice.
So don't bring it up again!

273
00:25:06,685 --> 00:25:09,483
- I don't care who did it.
- It wasn't me.

274
00:25:09,688 --> 00:25:13,954
Let me just say... I don't want my
kid's father to be a hoodlum.

275
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,558
You're all alone, Shaggy.

276
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,660
- All alone?
- That's right!

277
00:25:17,862 --> 00:25:19,659
- Clipper's gone religious.
- Hallelujah!

278
00:25:19,864 --> 00:25:21,559
- Goose is working.
- Ass-kisser!

279
00:25:21,766 --> 00:25:23,893
- And you?
- I haven't changed. So what?

280
00:25:24,102 --> 00:25:28,402
They've deserted me,
that's all.

281
00:25:28,606 --> 00:25:30,767
Then l'm deserting you too.

282
00:25:30,975 --> 00:25:33,466
I'm splitting, Shaggy.
Come with me, if you want.

283
00:25:33,678 --> 00:25:37,546
Otherwise, l'll go alone.

284
00:25:51,596 --> 00:25:54,224
Fish for sale!

285
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:57,401
My brother had promised
to stop messing around.

286
00:25:57,602 --> 00:26:04,064
But a hood doesn't stop,
a hood takes a break.

287
00:26:04,275 --> 00:26:07,574
Goose began messing around
with Shorty's wife.

288
00:26:08,046 --> 00:26:12,483
I have trout. But for special
customers like you...

289
00:26:12,684 --> 00:26:15,653
I also have a kisser fish.

290
00:26:15,854 --> 00:26:18,186
Hey, that's a mullet!

291
00:26:20,992 --> 00:26:22,823
Doesn't your husband...

292
00:26:23,027 --> 00:26:25,154
go down on you?

293
00:26:26,331 --> 00:26:27,855
No.

294
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:31,396
Mine, before entering me,
has to use his tongue.

295
00:26:31,603 --> 00:26:36,267
For about half an hour.
And from behind? Do you let him?

296
00:26:36,474 --> 00:26:41,673
- Good God, no. Doesn't it hurt?
- The first few times.

297
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,611
Then you'll see, it's fantastic.
But you need a banana.

298
00:26:45,817 --> 00:26:47,307
What for?

299
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:50,511
You're missing the good things
in life, girl!

300
00:26:50,722 --> 00:26:53,623
You take a banana, warm it up...

301
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:57,556
Put it up your thing, while he
takes you from behind.

302
00:26:57,762 --> 00:27:01,960
It's a real rush!
Ask your husband.

303
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:06,934
I couldn't. You don't know him.
He's liable to beat me.

304
00:27:07,138 --> 00:27:10,835
Try him. Men go wild
for smut like that.

305
00:27:18,383 --> 00:27:20,783
Motherfucking nigger!

306
00:27:23,021 --> 00:27:25,353
Slut!

307
00:27:26,524 --> 00:27:28,924
Whoring bitch!

308
00:27:31,629 --> 00:27:35,895
Rocket, give me your shorts.
Quick!

309
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:40,366
- Take them off, dammit!
- I'm not going naked in the street.

310
00:27:40,572 --> 00:27:44,440
You want your brother to die?
Give me your shorts. Now!

311
00:27:44,642 --> 00:27:46,473
Give me your shirt.

312
00:27:49,447 --> 00:27:51,415
Your shorts! Hurry up!

313
00:27:53,985 --> 00:27:58,251
I knew it. It's always me
who forks up for that bum.

314
00:28:06,297 --> 00:28:09,232
The bastard ran off.
That's his brother.

315
00:28:09,434 --> 00:28:11,629
- That brat there?
- I'll castrate that fucker.

316
00:28:14,072 --> 00:28:19,009
Fish! Fish for sale!

317
00:28:20,011 --> 00:28:22,673
Hey, kid, come over here.

318
00:28:23,581 --> 00:28:26,641
- Where's your brother?
- He's not working today.

319
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:29,581
- Oh yeah? Get in.
- I didn't do anything.

320
00:28:29,787 --> 00:28:31,778
- Get in!
- What about my fish?

321
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:35,118
- Hurry it up, kid!
- I don't want to lose my fish!

322
00:28:35,326 --> 00:28:39,285
- Forget your fish.
- Sit your ass down.

323
00:28:39,497 --> 00:28:43,297
- My father will kill me.
- That doesn't matter.

324
00:28:54,646 --> 00:28:56,841
Let's go.
There's nothing here.

325
00:28:57,048 --> 00:29:00,984
That day, my father swore he never
wanted to see my brother again.

326
00:29:01,185 --> 00:29:02,812
Let's go, Felipe.

327
00:29:06,024 --> 00:29:09,323
And he never did. No one ever
saw him in the ghetto again.

328
00:29:09,527 --> 00:29:12,985
The story of the Tender Trio
was coming to an end.

329
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:20,131
Li'l Dice? Shit, man. I thought you
were a goner at the motel.

330
00:29:20,338 --> 00:29:27,005
- You're fucking loaded!
- Don't, Benny. That's our money.

331
00:29:27,612 --> 00:29:31,446
Fuck you. Cut the crap
and give me the money.

332
00:29:31,983 --> 00:29:36,477
Benny... Tell your brother Shaggy
that Shorty is squealing.

333
00:29:36,854 --> 00:29:41,416
- I'm leaving the ghetto.
- But Shorty had his hands full...

334
00:29:55,073 --> 00:29:57,473
Let's go see, Stringy.

335
00:30:06,851 --> 00:30:10,651
A neighbor called the police
before sunrise.

336
00:30:10,855 --> 00:30:13,619
The tabloids went to town:

337
00:30:13,825 --> 00:30:16,988
"Man Buries Wife Alive
in the City of God"

338
00:30:17,195 --> 00:30:20,062
Along with reporters, the place
was swarming with cops.

339
00:30:20,264 --> 00:30:24,200
The hoodlums took off.

340
00:30:25,803 --> 00:30:28,670
- You wanna die?
- It's you who's gonna die...

341
00:30:28,873 --> 00:30:33,003
if you don't do what I say.
And show the lady more respect.

342
00:30:35,513 --> 00:30:37,071
Let's go, dammit!

343
00:30:37,281 --> 00:30:40,011
- There are cops ahead.
- Fuck them, let's go.

344
00:30:40,218 --> 00:30:42,880
- Where to?
- Anywhere, just go.

345
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:48,459
- What's the matter?
- Have mercy!

346
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:51,594
- This car's a piece of junk.
- My ass! Start the damn thing!

347
00:30:51,796 --> 00:30:54,321
It needs a push.

348
00:30:55,666 --> 00:30:57,531
Push, Shaggy!

349
00:30:57,735 --> 00:30:59,225
Push!

350
00:31:12,517 --> 00:31:16,886
You?

351
00:31:17,555 --> 00:31:20,388
You want to arrest the thieves?
Over there...

352
00:31:20,591 --> 00:31:23,754
Nab that guy over there!

353
00:31:48,052 --> 00:31:50,145
Run, Shaggy!

354
00:31:50,354 --> 00:31:53,755
Stop the car!

355
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:41,571
- This way! He's over here.
- We got that sonofabitch!

356
00:32:57,021 --> 00:32:59,512
- The bastard!
- He's a murderer.

357
00:32:59,724 --> 00:33:03,717
On the day Shaggy died
I remember the crowds...

358
00:33:03,928 --> 00:33:06,590
and a camera.

359
00:33:06,797 --> 00:33:10,062
I'd always wanted to have one.

360
00:33:11,802 --> 00:33:14,703
Let's go to school.

361
00:33:23,714 --> 00:33:25,682
- Well?
- Let's go to the beach.

362
00:33:25,883 --> 00:33:27,214
But we have an exam.

363
00:33:27,418 --> 00:33:31,081
So what?

364
00:33:31,289 --> 00:33:33,883
Everyone else is at the beach.

365
00:33:34,091 --> 00:33:37,083
Come on, let's go!

366
00:33:37,295 --> 00:33:40,696
She's in a bikini,
but doesn't want to go.

367
00:33:41,432 --> 00:33:45,801
What's that saying you have?

368
00:33:46,003 --> 00:33:49,166
The sun is for everyone. The beach,
for those who deserve it.

369
00:33:51,742 --> 00:33:54,040
THE SEVENTIES

370
00:33:54,245 --> 00:33:56,145
- Over here!
- I bought my first camera...

371
00:33:56,347 --> 00:34:00,613
when I was 16. Like all poor people,
I started at the bottom...

372
00:34:01,052 --> 00:34:03,520
with the world's cheapest model.

373
00:34:04,121 --> 00:34:07,420
So, Rocket?
How are things going?

374
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:09,684
Any luck getting laid yet?

375
00:34:09,894 --> 00:34:11,987
Zilch.

376
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:18,598
- Angelica. I was crazy about her.
- So, Rocket, still clicking away?

377
00:34:18,801 --> 00:34:22,999
She was gorgeous and the only
girl in our gang who screwed.

378
00:34:23,205 --> 00:34:25,196
I wanted to lose
my virginity with her.

379
00:34:25,407 --> 00:34:28,968
With her, buddy?
She's got a guy.

380
00:34:29,178 --> 00:34:32,409
- So? I'm not jealous.
- Her father's a sergeant.

381
00:34:32,615 --> 00:34:36,449
No one's perfect.
Closer together!

382
00:34:36,652 --> 00:34:38,916
I was the official
photographer of our gang.

383
00:34:39,955 --> 00:34:45,985
The gang of groovies. Everyone
paid to have copies of the pictures.

384
00:34:52,301 --> 00:34:55,498
Thiago, move back a little.

385
00:34:55,704 --> 00:34:58,502
- Is this okay?
- Perfect.

386
00:35:06,081 --> 00:35:08,481
I need a joint.

387
00:35:08,684 --> 00:35:13,451
Instead of smoking, man,
you should snort coke. It's far out.

388
00:35:13,656 --> 00:35:17,558
You snort, Thiago?
I prefer a good toke.

389
00:35:19,628 --> 00:35:22,893
If you like,
I can get it for you.

390
00:35:23,098 --> 00:35:27,728
You can? Then go on,
move your ass!

391
00:35:27,936 --> 00:35:31,702
But the choice stuff is coke.
That's a real nercotic.

392
00:35:31,907 --> 00:35:34,239
Narcotic!

393
00:35:36,545 --> 00:35:40,743
- Your mouth is all salty, Thiago.
- Screw you.

394
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,545
You want to be
a lifeguard, Stringy?

395
00:35:43,752 --> 00:35:46,243
- You're never in the water.
- My dad's a lifeguard.

396
00:35:46,455 --> 00:35:50,391
- I'll bet you a beer I swim better.
- You're on.

397
00:35:53,195 --> 00:35:56,995
If you like, I can go get you
a joint at Blacky's.

398
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:13,105
I'd have done anything
to please her...

399
00:36:14,249 --> 00:36:16,809
Buy her pot, coke...

400
00:36:21,023 --> 00:36:26,359
I could go to the top dogs to buy
quality stuff at a good price...

401
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:33,898
because the local boss
was a former classmate: Blacky.

402
00:36:35,404 --> 00:36:38,100
- Who is it?
- Rocket.

403
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:44,575
- How are things down there?
- Fine.

404
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,873
- And the kids?
- Fine too.

405
00:36:47,082 --> 00:36:48,982
- You want to buy or smoke a joint?
- Buy.

406
00:36:49,184 --> 00:36:53,951
Come in, buddy.

407
00:36:55,524 --> 00:37:00,018
Who is it?

408
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,000
This was Blacky's turf.

409
00:37:07,202 --> 00:37:10,797
But it hadn't always been his.

410
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:15,802
- Hey, Blacky.
- Fuck, Li'l Dice.

411
00:37:16,011 --> 00:37:20,277
- You show up like this at my place?
- Who said it was your place?

412
00:37:21,784 --> 00:37:27,245
THE STORY OF THE APARTMENT
Dona Zelia began selling drugs here...

413
00:37:27,456 --> 00:37:31,449
when her husband died,
in order to raise her daughters.

414
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:37,064
She also gave away drugs to boys at
times in return for special favors.

415
00:37:37,266 --> 00:37:42,966
Her favorite was "Big Boy".
One day, he grew very big!

416
00:37:43,172 --> 00:37:48,235
Zelia's operation was so amateur that
he had no trouble seizing it from her.

417
00:37:49,144 --> 00:37:53,638
Big Boy used the neighborhood
kids as dealers.

418
00:37:54,183 --> 00:37:58,552
- What about my pot?
- Stick it up your ass.

419
00:37:58,754 --> 00:38:01,518
The best dealer...

420
00:38:03,158 --> 00:38:05,991
...was Carrot.

421
00:38:06,195 --> 00:38:08,823
- Can I have a sip?
- Sure.

422
00:38:09,031 --> 00:38:11,659
He earned Big Boy's trust...

423
00:38:11,867 --> 00:38:14,859
was promoted, and moved up to
become a manager.

424
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:18,733
Blacky, 20 for us and
5 for you, okay?

425
00:38:20,275 --> 00:38:23,176
One day a buddy of Carrot's
showed up.

426
00:38:23,378 --> 00:38:29,317
- His name was Aristotle.
- My wife needs an operation.

427
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:35,855
His family had taken Carrot in
when he was down and out.

428
00:38:36,058 --> 00:38:38,822
He couldn't refuse to help
a brother in need.

429
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:43,464
Here's the dope. I want
the dough no later than Friday.

430
00:38:43,665 --> 00:38:46,498
- You've bailed me out, brother.
- Friday.

431
00:38:47,102 --> 00:38:50,936
He's my buddy, practically
my brother, Big Boy.

432
00:38:51,139 --> 00:38:55,132
Give him another week.

433
00:38:57,346 --> 00:39:01,874
- Either you kill him, or I'll kill you.
- Carrot had no choice.

434
00:39:03,552 --> 00:39:08,080
- I said Friday.
- Don't do it, man.

435
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:11,885
Carrot wanted to kill Big Boy,
but it wasn't necessary.

436
00:39:12,327 --> 00:39:16,320
Big Boy hadn't paid off the cops.
He died in jail.

437
00:39:19,568 --> 00:39:23,095
Carrot took everything
that belonged to Big Boy...

438
00:39:23,305 --> 00:39:26,934
but didn't want the apartment...

439
00:39:27,142 --> 00:39:31,010
the place was ill-fated. Carrot gave it
to his most trusted dealer...

440
00:39:31,213 --> 00:39:33,943
- Here. 150 bags.
- Blacky.

441
00:39:34,149 --> 00:39:36,276
Give me more. This place
is crawling with druggies.

442
00:39:36,485 --> 00:39:39,750
That's how he took over
the local trade.

443
00:39:39,955 --> 00:39:42,219
But not for long...

444
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:45,689
Who is it?

445
00:39:45,894 --> 00:39:47,759
Go see.

446
00:39:58,707 --> 00:40:00,698
- Hey, Blacky.
- Fuck, Li'l Dice.

447
00:40:00,909 --> 00:40:04,777
- You show up like this at my place?
- Who said it was your place?

448
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,847
Yeah, who?

449
00:40:13,055 --> 00:40:14,955
- Something wrong, Li'l Dice?
- Li'l Dice, my ass.

450
00:40:15,157 --> 00:40:17,421
My name is Li'l Z' now.

451
00:40:17,626 --> 00:40:20,026
THE STORY OF Ll'L Z'

452
00:40:20,228 --> 00:40:23,254
Li'l Z' had always wanted
to be boss of the City of God...

453
00:40:23,465 --> 00:40:27,799
ever since he was little
and was called "Li'l Dice".

454
00:40:31,606 --> 00:40:34,871
They're having fun,
and not me?

455
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,950
I want to get out of here.

456
00:40:47,756 --> 00:40:51,783
What, kid? Your friend took
everything. What do you want?

457
00:40:57,966 --> 00:41:01,231
That night, Li'I Dice
satisfied his thirst to kill...

458
00:41:01,436 --> 00:41:03,961
though he knew Shaggy would
never forgive him.

459
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:15,646
To avoid being punished
he left the City of God.

460
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:19,582
He had to work hard for peanuts.

461
00:41:24,693 --> 00:41:27,856
- Yeah, Benny!
- Li'l Dice and Benny managed well.

462
00:41:29,898 --> 00:41:31,661
They had the gift of crime.

463
00:41:31,867 --> 00:41:34,631
- You have more money than me.
- It was my idea.

464
00:41:34,836 --> 00:41:37,999
The only problem was running into
an older hoodlum...

465
00:41:38,206 --> 00:41:41,437
...like my brother, Goose.
- Li'l Dice?

466
00:41:41,643 --> 00:41:44,976
Shit, man. I thought
you were a goner at the motel.

467
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,876
You're fucking loaded!

468
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:51,746
Don't, Benny. That's our money.

469
00:41:52,287 --> 00:41:56,656
Benny, tell your brother Shaggy...

470
00:41:56,858 --> 00:42:01,386
that Shorty is squealing.
I'm leaving the ghetto.

471
00:42:03,965 --> 00:42:05,432
Goose!

472
00:42:07,836 --> 00:42:11,272
From Shaggy. You'll need it.

473
00:42:31,326 --> 00:42:33,954
From one hit to the next,
Li'l Dice grew up.

474
00:42:34,162 --> 00:42:38,565
At 18, he was the most
respected hood in the City of God.

475
00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:40,826
You're of age now, watch out!

476
00:42:41,036 --> 00:42:44,335
He was one of the most
wanted robbers in Rio.

477
00:42:57,619 --> 00:42:59,280
Li'l Dice, how's it going?

478
00:42:59,488 --> 00:43:03,117
Happy birthday.
I'm so glad you've turned 18...

479
00:43:03,325 --> 00:43:06,556
- Get lost, Tuba!
- Excuse me, amigo...

480
00:43:07,195 --> 00:43:09,254
Give me a beer!

481
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:13,093
Didn't you see me, prick?

482
00:43:13,301 --> 00:43:15,166
- Sorry, man.
- Up yours!

483
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:18,737
The next time,
l'll waste you, asshole!

484
00:43:20,142 --> 00:43:22,167
Fag!

485
00:43:22,511 --> 00:43:25,446
Li'I Dice was ready for anything.

486
00:43:25,647 --> 00:43:27,581
I wanna talk.

487
00:43:27,782 --> 00:43:30,774
- And he was itching to start.
- Who are the fattest cats here?

488
00:43:31,219 --> 00:43:35,451
- There are tons of them.
- Look at Jerry Adriani...

489
00:43:35,657 --> 00:43:39,753
gold chain, snazzy clothes.

490
00:43:39,961 --> 00:43:42,156
Look at Pereira
and the chick he's with...

491
00:43:42,364 --> 00:43:46,232
- Bernice. She was my brother's girl.
- Check out his car.

492
00:43:46,835 --> 00:43:50,965
Then there's Blacky.
Covered in gold.

493
00:43:51,173 --> 00:43:53,835
Gold chain, gold watch...

494
00:43:54,042 --> 00:43:57,205
Look at Carrot, and his car.

495
00:43:57,412 --> 00:44:01,143
- They're all dealers.
- They're all fucking loaded.

496
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:03,374
Hold-ups bring in chickenshit.

497
00:44:03,585 --> 00:44:06,383
- The big bucks are in drugs.
- I see.

498
00:44:06,588 --> 00:44:08,579
Especially in selling coke.

499
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:11,054
- But you need money.
- Not really...

500
00:44:11,259 --> 00:44:14,956
We'll kill these clowns
and take over their business.

501
00:44:15,163 --> 00:44:17,927
- When do we start?
- Now.

502
00:44:27,442 --> 00:44:31,401
Exu-the-Devil is the light
that shines forth.

503
00:44:31,613 --> 00:44:34,207
He brought you here.

504
00:44:34,416 --> 00:44:39,615
Why remain in the City of God
where God has forgotten you?

505
00:44:40,488 --> 00:44:44,891
I know what you want.
You want power.

506
00:44:45,093 --> 00:44:49,223
I have something which will
give it to you.

507
00:44:50,765 --> 00:44:55,259
To change your fate,
I give you my protector, boy.

508
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:59,065
But you mustn't fornicate
with the amulet...

509
00:44:59,274 --> 00:45:01,742
otherwise...

510
00:45:02,811 --> 00:45:05,211
you'll die.

511
00:45:05,714 --> 00:45:08,114
The boy is no longer called
Li'l Dice...

512
00:45:08,316 --> 00:45:10,307
but Li'l Z'.

513
00:45:10,518 --> 00:45:14,079
Li'l Z' will grow up.

514
00:45:14,389 --> 00:45:18,189
You stick with me,
l'll stick with you.

515
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:32,929
Li'l Dice became Li'I Z'
and he began to kill.

516
00:45:33,975 --> 00:45:40,642
He started one morning,
taking over Jerry Adriani's racket.

517
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:46,219
By that night, almost all
of the rackets in the ghetto were his.

518
00:45:46,421 --> 00:45:49,822
The only business he didn't
touch was Carrot's...

519
00:45:50,025 --> 00:45:53,984
since he was a friend of Benny's.
All that was left was the apartment...

520
00:45:54,195 --> 00:45:55,253
But that would be easy.

521
00:46:00,035 --> 00:46:03,095
Who is it?

522
00:46:09,844 --> 00:46:11,709
- Hey, Blacky.
- Fuck, Li'l Dice.

523
00:46:11,913 --> 00:46:18,045
- You show up like this at my place?
- Who said it was your place?

524
00:46:18,253 --> 00:46:19,880
- Something wrong, Li'l Dice?
- Li'l Dice, my ass.

525
00:46:20,088 --> 00:46:23,546
- My name is Li'l Z' now.
- His name's Li'l Z', see?

526
00:46:23,758 --> 00:46:26,886
- You're a goner, bastard.
- Don't kill him. He understands.

527
00:46:27,095 --> 00:46:29,222
Right, Blacky?

528
00:46:29,431 --> 00:46:33,959
It's all yours, I don't want anything.
I don't want no trouble, okay?

529
00:46:34,169 --> 00:46:37,297
I should have taken this chance
to avenge my brother's death.

530
00:46:39,174 --> 00:46:43,873
You'll live, but you'll
work for us. Understand?

531
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,172
That's easy to say...

532
00:46:47,515 --> 00:46:50,712
- Where are you going?
- He's clean, Li'l Z'.

533
00:46:51,286 --> 00:46:52,719
What's your name, kid?

534
00:46:52,921 --> 00:46:56,721
- Rocket.
- He's Goose's brother.

535
00:46:56,925 --> 00:46:59,519
- Goose?
- The late Goose.

536
00:47:00,729 --> 00:47:02,993
Quick, kid. Run along.

537
00:47:03,198 --> 00:47:07,658
Tell everyone that this business
now belongs to Li'l Z'.

538
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:11,771
And that we'll be selling coke.
Got that?

539
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,869
Cocaine.

540
00:47:16,878 --> 00:47:19,813
- Where's the turf?
- Over there, on the left.

541
00:47:20,014 --> 00:47:23,040
Selling drugs is like any
other business.

542
00:47:23,385 --> 00:47:25,285
The supplier
delivers the merchandise...

543
00:47:25,487 --> 00:47:28,217
which is then
packaged on the premises.

544
00:47:28,556 --> 00:47:32,356
It's done in an assembly line.

545
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,619
Boring as hell...

546
00:47:35,096 --> 00:47:39,123
Pot is wrapped up in "lids".

547
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:42,097
Cocaine is put into packets...

548
00:47:42,837 --> 00:47:47,069
and then into bundles
of 10 or 100.

549
00:47:47,442 --> 00:47:50,309
You can even make a career
in dealing drugs.

550
00:47:50,512 --> 00:47:54,346
The kids start out
as delivery boys.

551
00:47:54,616 --> 00:47:58,609
They're paid to run errands
and take messages.

552
00:47:59,354 --> 00:48:02,346
Then they become lookouts.
If the police arrive...

553
00:48:02,557 --> 00:48:05,390
the kites disappear
and everyone scrams.

554
00:48:06,661 --> 00:48:10,256
Later, you become a dealer
or a "vapor".

555
00:48:10,465 --> 00:48:13,559
When the heat's on, the
"vapor" quickly evaporates.

556
00:48:13,768 --> 00:48:17,898
Moving up the ladder,
you have the "soldier".

557
00:48:18,139 --> 00:48:21,734
And if the guy is good at math,
he can become a manager...

558
00:48:21,943 --> 00:48:25,401
the boss' right-hand man.

559
00:48:26,848 --> 00:48:30,784
The police receive their part
and don't make trouble.

560
00:48:32,987 --> 00:48:35,581
Since Li'l Z' killed off
all of his enemies...

561
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:40,750
there were no shoot-outs in the
City of God. You could drive there...

562
00:48:41,129 --> 00:48:44,656
The playboys felt safe
buying their drugs there.

563
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:50,764
The City teemed with addicts
and Li'l Z' grew rich.

564
00:48:51,706 --> 00:48:54,004
- Is it okay?
- It's a deal.

565
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:01,706
- I can't decide which to wear.
- This one's cool.

566
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:06,919
If dealing were legal, Li'l Z'
would have been man of the year.

567
00:49:10,191 --> 00:49:13,126
But things were risky for me.
I was afraid of him.

568
00:49:13,328 --> 00:49:17,526
- And he was everywhere.
- What a drag this guy is.

569
00:49:17,732 --> 00:49:22,863
Whenever I wanted to smoke a joint
I had to go see Carrot.

570
00:49:27,475 --> 00:49:30,376
Half a lid. Thanks.

571
00:49:31,513 --> 00:49:35,677
But it was worth it.
I only smoked with Angelica.

572
00:49:37,352 --> 00:49:40,219
She and Thiago had split up,
so I made my move.

573
00:49:40,421 --> 00:49:46,223
- I was about to win her over...
- These pictures are really great.

574
00:49:46,427 --> 00:49:50,022
- You think so?
- I look good here.

575
00:49:50,231 --> 00:49:52,995
- You look beautiful everywhere.
- I'm serious.

576
00:49:53,201 --> 00:49:54,190
Me too.

577
00:49:57,105 --> 00:50:02,338
A setting sun,
a deserted beach... a long kiss...

578
00:50:02,544 --> 00:50:05,377
I was sure this was it...

579
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,571
But the Runts arrived.

580
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:12,415
Can I have a toke?

581
00:50:17,992 --> 00:50:19,186
Here.

582
00:50:19,394 --> 00:50:23,592
I'm going. See you later.

583
00:50:25,466 --> 00:50:28,765
Hold on, Angelica.

584
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:31,461
- Your joint, man.
- Keep it.

585
00:50:31,673 --> 00:50:34,005
What a cool guy.

586
00:50:36,978 --> 00:50:41,347
That was my first run
in with the Runts.

587
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:50,280
- Steak and fries, Benny.
- Great! Here...

588
00:50:53,794 --> 00:50:59,733
- A tip for you.
- Really? Thanks.

589
00:50:59,933 --> 00:51:02,231
- Wanna eat something?
- No.

590
00:51:05,439 --> 00:51:09,637
- Wanna trade this watch?
- After Angelica left him...

591
00:51:09,843 --> 00:51:11,743
Thiago began snorting
more and more.

592
00:51:11,945 --> 00:51:15,039
- Is it your grandfather's?
- No, my dad's.

593
00:51:15,248 --> 00:51:19,548
When a guy is really hooked
he ends up in the hands of the dealer.

594
00:51:19,753 --> 00:51:21,880
- Two bags of ten.
- One of ten.

595
00:51:22,089 --> 00:51:26,185
- Okay, one bag.
- For Thiago, it was different.

596
00:51:26,393 --> 00:51:29,885
- Watch out!
- Sorry, godfather.

597
00:51:30,263 --> 00:51:33,061
Godfather, my ass.
Did I baptize your kids?

598
00:51:33,266 --> 00:51:36,292
- I'm sorry.
- Now beat it.

599
00:51:38,905 --> 00:51:42,898
Blacky, lend me your bike.

600
00:52:06,366 --> 00:52:08,630
Hey, wanna race?

601
00:52:08,835 --> 00:52:12,293
- Where to?
- Up to the highway.

602
00:52:12,906 --> 00:52:15,841
- Okay.
- Ready? Go!

603
00:52:38,231 --> 00:52:42,065
- Pretty tough, wasn't it?
- Yeah, you're good.

604
00:52:42,269 --> 00:52:44,601
Where'd you buy those sneakers?

605
00:52:44,804 --> 00:52:47,398
- Not far from here.
- The shirt, as well?

606
00:52:47,607 --> 00:52:49,939
- No, uptown.
- Cool.

607
00:52:50,143 --> 00:52:52,373
It's a designer shirt.

608
00:52:52,579 --> 00:52:54,911
If I give you money
can you buy me one?

609
00:52:55,115 --> 00:52:57,777
Shorts and a shirt?

610
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:02,318
Buy whatever you can.

611
00:53:04,991 --> 00:53:07,050
- What size are you?
- Measure me.

612
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:10,195
- With what, man?
- Shit, with your hand.

613
00:53:11,698 --> 00:53:14,428
Shoe size? Turn around.

614
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:28,170
- Hey, Benny!
- You got the digs?

615
00:53:31,184 --> 00:53:34,449
- Just one pair of pants?
- No, there's more.

616
00:53:39,593 --> 00:53:40,855
- You like it?
- Yeah.

617
00:53:42,128 --> 00:53:44,460
There's some change.

618
00:53:45,031 --> 00:53:47,966
- Keep it.
- Cool.

619
00:53:56,476 --> 00:53:59,070
This is Benny.

620
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:03,775
- This is Rocket.
- Hi. I know him.

621
00:54:28,241 --> 00:54:30,903
I've become a playboy.

622
00:54:32,846 --> 00:54:36,976
Hey, gangsters, listen to this...

623
00:54:37,183 --> 00:54:39,014
Watch out...

624
00:54:39,219 --> 00:54:42,882
Groovies shake their asses
before laying a big one.

625
00:54:46,359 --> 00:54:48,088
Oh, yeah?

626
00:54:48,962 --> 00:54:51,658
Fuck off, you bastards!

627
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,800
Making fun of me?

628
00:54:59,072 --> 00:55:01,267
Asshole!

629
00:55:16,189 --> 00:55:20,387
Benny, didn't I tell you to shoot Carrot?
He's endangering the ghetto.

630
00:55:20,593 --> 00:55:24,120
- Cool it. Go talk to him.
- I'm gonna kill that fucker.

631
00:55:24,331 --> 00:55:27,198
- Stop trying to wipe out everyone.
- I'm gonna kill him.

632
00:55:29,536 --> 00:55:32,528
Don't worry, Angelica.
The guys in here are cool.

633
00:55:32,739 --> 00:55:35,333
Sure, l'm not worried.

634
00:55:35,809 --> 00:55:39,643
You gonna dance, Benny?
What about Carrot?

635
00:55:39,846 --> 00:55:43,907
Go on, buddy. Go talk to the guy.

636
00:55:44,117 --> 00:55:47,678
Benny was the coolest hood
in the City of God.

637
00:55:47,887 --> 00:55:51,050
He gave away pot,
paid for drinks.

638
00:55:51,558 --> 00:55:54,652
Li'l Z' was the opposite.
He had one obsession:

639
00:55:54,861 --> 00:55:56,829
To be the boss of the ghetto.

640
00:55:57,030 --> 00:56:00,295
He wanted an excuse to take over
Carrot's racket.

641
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,127
- Hey, Carrot.
- What's up?

642
00:56:02,335 --> 00:56:06,635
You shouldn't let the Runts
do hold-ups in the ghetto.

643
00:56:07,207 --> 00:56:10,005
You look after your section,
l'll look after mine.

644
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:14,078
Got that? I'm gonna get a drink.

645
00:56:21,955 --> 00:56:26,858
- Hey, Rocket! How's it going?
- Great.

646
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:30,120
- Hey, Benny!
- How's it going?

647
00:56:30,897 --> 00:56:33,866
- Hey, Thiago. How are you?
- Good.

648
00:56:34,934 --> 00:56:36,401
- May I?
- Sure...

649
00:56:36,603 --> 00:56:38,901
Wanna dance?

650
00:56:42,409 --> 00:56:45,867
- Is it okay at your place?
- No problem.

651
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,742
My parents are out.
You'll be all alone with her.

652
00:56:49,949 --> 00:56:54,352
- You can lose your virginity tonight.
- Not so loud, man!

653
00:56:54,554 --> 00:56:56,283
Everyone will hear.

654
00:56:57,524 --> 00:56:59,924
- You're beautiful.
- Thank you.

655
00:57:00,126 --> 00:57:04,586
- Shit!
- Nothing's happening.

656
00:57:11,805 --> 00:57:16,105
Look, man, I know the Runts
are associated with you.

657
00:57:16,309 --> 00:57:19,972
Think I'm a sucker, you little brat?
You want to take my racket?

658
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:24,378
I want to talk to you
because you're fucking useless.

659
00:57:24,584 --> 00:57:25,573
Get your hand away!

660
00:57:25,785 --> 00:57:28,811
The Runts are screwing up
our security, man.

661
00:57:29,022 --> 00:57:30,353
Give the baby his bottle.

662
00:57:30,557 --> 00:57:32,957
Carrot, just ask the kids
to cool it, okay?

663
00:57:33,159 --> 00:57:36,560
Carrot's useless. He lets the Runts
do hold-ups in his section.

664
00:57:36,763 --> 00:57:39,698
The police come around and
that's bad for business.

665
00:57:39,966 --> 00:57:43,561
I'll do it only because
I like you.

666
00:57:43,903 --> 00:57:45,564
But you need to change
that baby's diapers.

667
00:57:45,772 --> 00:57:49,606
I'll show you who's the baby...

668
00:57:49,809 --> 00:57:55,304
Tell the kids that in my ghetto
no one robs or rapes!

669
00:57:55,515 --> 00:57:56,982
No wonder you're "Little" Z'!

670
00:58:00,153 --> 00:58:05,090
The Runts were kids who didn't
respect the laws of the ghetto.

671
00:58:05,291 --> 00:58:08,749
They would mug residents,
hold up bakeries...

672
00:58:08,962 --> 00:58:11,157
especially in Carrot's section.

673
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:17,661
What are you doing?

674
00:58:19,439 --> 00:58:23,933
- You rob me all the time!
- But they didn't know...

675
00:58:24,143 --> 00:58:26,475
that the City had a boss now.

676
00:58:28,348 --> 00:58:30,373
THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING US

677
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:34,417
The City had become
much safer for residents.

678
00:58:35,755 --> 00:58:38,622
There were hardly
any hold-ups now.

679
00:58:38,858 --> 00:58:40,155
You just had to go see Li'l Z'.

680
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:43,488
- Let's go.
- Don't hurt the Runts.

681
00:58:43,696 --> 00:58:46,597
I won't touch them.

682
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:52,238
- Hi, Steak.
- How's it going, Li'l Z'?

683
00:58:52,438 --> 00:58:55,134
- Wanna take a walk, Steak?
- With you? Hold on...

684
00:58:57,577 --> 00:59:00,569
Mom, l'm going out with
my friends.

685
00:59:13,026 --> 00:59:15,688
That's the best chicken
I ever ate.

686
00:59:16,162 --> 00:59:20,223
- The old guy was scared shitless.
- Feeling sorry for him?

687
00:59:20,433 --> 00:59:23,459
You're crazy, man!

688
00:59:31,878 --> 00:59:34,745
Why not stick up
a bank or a supermarket?

689
00:59:34,948 --> 00:59:39,385
- Peanuts. Drugs are where it's at.
- Yeah, selling drugs.

690
00:59:39,586 --> 00:59:45,889
But you have to start out as a delivery
boy. You wanna be a delivery boy?

691
00:59:46,092 --> 00:59:51,325
It's a rip off.
It takes a long time to move up.

692
00:59:51,631 --> 00:59:55,965
You have to wait till an older guy
gets killed to move up.

693
00:59:56,202 --> 00:59:59,365
I don't wanna wait till some guy
croaks. I'm gonna do what Li'l Z' did.

694
00:59:59,572 --> 01:00:02,268
I'm gonna wipe them all out.

695
01:00:02,475 --> 01:00:05,308
Talking about me, kid?
The boss is here.

696
01:00:09,415 --> 01:00:10,973
Come back, you brat!

697
01:00:15,355 --> 01:00:22,022
- They're quick, those kids.
- They run fast.

698
01:00:23,262 --> 01:00:26,163
They're all gone except you.
Any others?

699
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:36,402
You're gonna pay
for the ones that escaped.

700
01:00:36,609 --> 01:00:40,773
You choose. Shall I shoot you
in the hand or foot?

701
01:00:41,381 --> 01:00:43,281
Come on, choose!

702
01:00:43,483 --> 01:00:46,247
Hand or foot?

703
01:00:48,788 --> 01:00:51,518
Choose, for fuck's sake!

704
01:00:59,265 --> 01:01:02,393
- Hand.
- The little hand, eh?

705
01:01:11,277 --> 01:01:13,370
Cool.

706
01:01:14,647 --> 01:01:19,050
Hey, Steak'n'fries,
let's see what you're made of.

707
01:01:19,252 --> 01:01:22,585
Choose and then kill
one of them.

708
01:01:22,789 --> 01:01:26,589
- Leave it. I'll do it.
- Butt out, Tuba. This is for him.

709
01:01:29,429 --> 01:01:31,260
Go on, Steak.

710
01:01:31,464 --> 01:01:34,900
Go on, choose one and shoot.

711
01:01:35,101 --> 01:01:38,127
Come on, I haven't got all day.

712
01:01:38,337 --> 01:01:41,170
Kill one of them.

713
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:47,504
Let's go, Steak.
I'm in a hurry.

714
01:01:47,714 --> 01:01:51,081
I wanna see what you're made of.

715
01:01:58,758 --> 01:02:02,091
Well done!

716
01:02:02,295 --> 01:02:03,523
You did it.

717
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:09,530
- You're one of us. Give me five.
- Very good, Steak.

718
01:02:12,205 --> 01:02:18,872
Get up, brat. Go back
to your rat hole. Without limping!

719
01:02:19,712 --> 01:02:24,012
Tell your buddies that no one
robs in Li'l Zs ghetto.

720
01:02:24,217 --> 01:02:26,981
Go now.
And no limping, okay?

721
01:02:29,288 --> 01:02:31,518
Cool, Li'l Z'.

722
01:02:44,103 --> 01:02:47,766
While Li'l Z' was winning
the respect of the residents...

723
01:02:48,241 --> 01:02:51,210
Benny was winning
Angelica's heart.

724
01:02:51,744 --> 01:02:56,374
As for me, I was still
a virgin, single and broke.

725
01:02:56,582 --> 01:02:58,846
I had no choice.

726
01:02:59,952 --> 01:03:02,887
SUCKER'S LIFE

727
01:03:03,089 --> 01:03:06,820
I had to take a job
in a supermarket.

728
01:03:07,026 --> 01:03:11,554
I worked long hours for chicken feed.
I wanted to be laid off...

729
01:03:11,764 --> 01:03:15,791
so I could buy a camera
with the severance pay.

730
01:03:17,003 --> 01:03:20,131
But things didn't
work out that way.

731
01:03:23,209 --> 01:03:25,871
- It's the guy on the beach.
- Hey, bro!

732
01:03:26,078 --> 01:03:28,774
- Still smoking good stuff?
- Yeah.

733
01:03:28,981 --> 01:03:30,642
That guy's too cool.

734
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:33,410
Hey, kid. Come here.
Lift up your shirt.

735
01:03:38,424 --> 01:03:41,791
We give these ghetto kids a chance
and they don't appreciate it.

736
01:03:41,994 --> 01:03:45,486
- What about my severance pay?
- What severance pay?

737
01:03:45,698 --> 01:03:49,657
That fucking manager thought
I was part of the gang.

738
01:03:49,869 --> 01:03:55,034
You're fired for serious misconduct.
Get out. Immediately!

739
01:03:55,241 --> 01:03:58,699
I didn't get a single cent.

740
01:04:12,491 --> 01:04:14,652
It was like a message from God:

741
01:04:16,963 --> 01:04:20,797
"Honesty doesn't pay, sucker'."

742
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,265
FLIRTING WITH CRIME

743
01:04:33,446 --> 01:04:37,177
The bus sure took a long time to come.
I should already be at work.

744
01:04:37,984 --> 01:04:41,385
Shit, hide that gun.
Are you nuts?

745
01:04:41,587 --> 01:04:43,248
It was Goose's.
It's broken anyway.

746
01:04:43,456 --> 01:04:46,516
It's not our fault, the company
runs few buses on this line.

747
01:04:46,759 --> 01:04:51,355
It's never anyone's fault.
It's always someone else's.

748
01:04:51,564 --> 01:04:55,523
But it's the workers who suffer.
And then, they make us squeeze!

749
01:04:55,735 --> 01:04:57,862
Have a nice evening, ma'am.

750
01:05:00,373 --> 01:05:02,739
I know that guy.

751
01:05:02,942 --> 01:05:05,035
He lives in the City.
He'll recognize us.

752
01:05:05,244 --> 01:05:07,838
So? He couldn't care less
if we take his boss' money.

753
01:05:08,047 --> 01:05:10,311
Okay. Let's go.

754
01:05:13,219 --> 01:05:16,677
Well, boys? Aren't you from
the City of God?

755
01:05:17,123 --> 01:05:18,420
Yeah.

756
01:05:18,624 --> 01:05:21,787
I'll let one of you through
without paying.

757
01:05:26,065 --> 01:05:30,195
You should study
so you can get out of the ghetto.

758
01:05:30,403 --> 01:05:33,270
It's too full of cops and
hoodlums.

759
01:05:33,472 --> 01:05:37,340
- Did you study?
- I was in school and in the army.

760
01:05:37,543 --> 01:05:40,706
I was the best marksman
in my barracks.

761
01:05:40,913 --> 01:05:43,438
This job was all
I could find afterwards.

762
01:05:43,649 --> 01:05:47,847
But I do karate.
If l'm hired somewhere...

763
01:05:48,054 --> 01:05:50,147
l'll leave the ghetto.

764
01:05:50,656 --> 01:05:55,116
- Do you fight, then?
- I'm for peace and love.

765
01:05:55,494 --> 01:05:56,961
But if I have to...

766
01:05:57,163 --> 01:05:59,961
He didn't know he would have to.

767
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:03,727
But not yet, it's not time
to tell Knockout Ned's story.

768
01:06:04,303 --> 01:06:06,464
- We should be going.
- Let's go.

769
01:06:06,672 --> 01:06:07,661
- Good bye.
- Thanks.

770
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,371
See you.

771
01:06:14,647 --> 01:06:17,377
I couldn't do it.
He was such a cool guy.

772
01:06:17,583 --> 01:06:20,746
Yeah, totally.
That's Gerson's brother.

773
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:23,952
Let's go home.

774
01:06:26,092 --> 01:06:30,153
There's nothing here
except that bakery over there.

775
01:06:30,363 --> 01:06:35,232
- What will you say?
- I don't know. "This is a hold-up."

776
01:06:37,336 --> 01:06:38,928
Here's my number.

777
01:06:39,138 --> 01:06:41,333
- You like soul or groovy parties?
- Soul.

778
01:06:41,707 --> 01:06:43,470
That one didn't work either.

779
01:06:43,676 --> 01:06:47,009
The counter girl was just too foxy.
And she flirted with me.

780
01:06:47,213 --> 01:06:48,373
Will you call me?

781
01:06:49,615 --> 01:06:53,176
I couldn't pull a gun on her,
she was too sweet.

782
01:06:53,386 --> 01:06:55,183
Yeah, I agree.

783
01:07:02,194 --> 01:07:05,163
Excuse me. I'm lost.
How do I get to Barra?

784
01:07:05,364 --> 01:07:06,353
- To Barra?
- Yes.

785
01:07:06,565 --> 01:07:09,363
I thought: "Tough luck
for this guy from Sao Paulo."

786
01:07:09,568 --> 01:07:12,594
- In fact, we were going there.
- You're kidding.

787
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:17,175
- You're a lifesaver.
- That's right.

788
01:07:17,943 --> 01:07:21,344
Because no guy from Sao Paulo
could ever be cool.

789
01:07:28,821 --> 01:07:32,052
- The body's over here.
- We found it, Chief.

790
01:07:32,258 --> 01:07:34,749
The forensic expert!

791
01:07:50,242 --> 01:07:52,335
- Not a pretty sight, eh?
- You said it.

792
01:07:52,545 --> 01:07:54,843
- What a great singer.
- You like him?

793
01:07:55,047 --> 01:08:00,383
- I love music. What about you?
- Tell me, do you also like pot?

794
01:08:03,689 --> 01:08:06,180
I can't say l've never tried it.

795
01:08:06,392 --> 01:08:09,520
The devil recognizes his own.

796
01:08:11,597 --> 01:08:14,191
- Do you have papers?
- I think so.

797
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,834
I have some.

798
01:08:19,438 --> 01:08:22,202
I'd always been an ace
at rolling a joint.

799
01:08:22,408 --> 01:08:24,808
If l'd had the same skill
with girls...

800
01:08:25,611 --> 01:08:29,775
l'd never have lost so many chances
to lose my virginity.

801
01:08:31,884 --> 01:08:36,651
- For a Sao Paulo guy you're very cool.
- Thanks, bro.

802
01:08:36,856 --> 01:08:39,757
What did they use?

803
01:08:40,126 --> 01:08:44,153
A club or a rock.
And the child?

804
01:08:44,363 --> 01:08:47,298
- Untouched.
- Thank goodness.

805
01:08:47,766 --> 01:08:52,260
- How long ago?
- About four hours.

806
01:08:52,805 --> 01:08:55,467
- Can we take it away?
- Go ahead.

807
01:08:56,842 --> 01:09:00,778
The murderer has to be
from the City of God.

808
01:09:19,565 --> 01:09:24,093
You bastard!
You motherfucker!

809
01:09:24,803 --> 01:09:27,738
Did you have to kill
your chick in the ghetto?

810
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:30,932
- The place is crawling with cops now!
- Come on, Li'l Z'.

811
01:09:31,143 --> 01:09:35,603
- Come on? Fuck you!
- I had to avenge my honor.

812
01:09:35,814 --> 01:09:39,306
Her family's turned me in.
You won't have any problems.

813
01:09:39,518 --> 01:09:43,010
The cops are everywhere because
of you. You're dead meat, asshole.

814
01:09:43,222 --> 01:09:46,089
Let up, Li'l Z'.
You've punished him enough.

815
01:09:46,292 --> 01:09:48,419
You know the law.

816
01:09:48,627 --> 01:09:51,289
Anyone who kills in my ghetto
has to die as an example.

817
01:09:51,497 --> 01:09:54,091
That was his business, Li'l Z'.

818
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:56,894
Listen, you sonofabitch,
get outta the ghetto.

819
01:09:57,102 --> 01:09:59,195
You showed no respect, understand?

820
01:10:02,741 --> 01:10:04,038
You know what, Benny?

821
01:10:04,243 --> 01:10:07,804
You're too nice. If you raise
a snake, expect to get bitten.

822
01:10:08,013 --> 01:10:10,880
He wasn't worth shit.

823
01:10:11,283 --> 01:10:14,081
- A dirty traitor.
- Shut up, Tuba.

824
01:10:14,286 --> 01:10:16,652
I'm going for a walk
with my girl.

825
01:10:16,855 --> 01:10:22,020
Okay, be careful.
When things calm down...

826
01:10:22,228 --> 01:10:25,254
we'll get back to our business
with Carrot, okay?

827
01:10:30,202 --> 01:10:33,262
You need a girlfriend, Li'l Z'.

828
01:10:53,591 --> 01:10:55,821
Know what l'm thinking, Benny?

829
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:58,952
That l'm so sexy?

830
01:10:59,164 --> 01:11:02,725
That too. But I mean,
you know what we could do?

831
01:11:02,934 --> 01:11:06,426
- Make love again.
- I'm serious.

832
01:11:07,071 --> 01:11:11,735
We could go away from here.
This violence sucks.

833
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:14,342
Go where?

834
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:17,080
To a farm.

835
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:22,651
We're really hippies at heart,
aren't we?

836
01:11:24,055 --> 01:11:26,182
A farm?

837
01:11:29,561 --> 01:11:32,121
Peace and love?

838
01:11:51,983 --> 01:11:56,716
BENNY'S FAREWELL

839
01:12:05,396 --> 01:12:08,695
Benny was just too cool
to go on being a hoodlum.

840
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:12,529
He succeeded in getting everybody
together for his good-bye party.

841
01:12:12,737 --> 01:12:14,034
The gangs...

842
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:17,699
The soul crowd...

843
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:27,646
- The religious crowd...
- One day, l'll go to church.

844
01:12:27,852 --> 01:12:29,786
The samba crowd...

845
01:12:33,458 --> 01:12:35,653
The groovy crowd...

846
01:12:38,463 --> 01:12:42,456
And Li'l Z', who had never
danced in his life.

847
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:06,347
Want to dance with me?
Want to dance with me?

848
01:13:06,557 --> 01:13:08,957
- I didn't hear...
- Want to dance?

849
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:12,254
No, thank you, l'm with someone.

850
01:13:26,878 --> 01:13:28,505
Hey, Rocket!

851
01:13:42,427 --> 01:13:45,863
Come, I want to talk
to you, buddy.

852
01:13:46,831 --> 01:13:49,891
- You can't just split with that chick.
- Why not?

853
01:13:50,101 --> 01:13:54,299
I'm gonna go live on a farm,
smoke pot, listen to rock.

854
01:13:54,505 --> 01:13:58,305
You wanna throw away everything
we've accomplished for that bitch?

855
01:13:58,943 --> 01:14:02,003
She's not a bitch, she's my girl.

856
01:14:02,213 --> 01:14:04,807
We'll take over Carrot's business,
it'll be yours.

857
01:14:05,016 --> 01:14:08,349
- Leave Carrot alone, he's a good guy.
- He's a motherfucker!

858
01:14:08,553 --> 01:14:11,852
See? Everyone's a motherfucker
to you. That's why l'm leaving.

859
01:14:12,056 --> 01:14:15,753
I'm your friend,
but l'm getting out.

860
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:18,190
You got to understand,
I have to go.

861
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:23,767
I love you, man,
but l've had enough.

862
01:15:22,994 --> 01:15:25,360
Motherfucker, let's see
if you have any balls.

863
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:29,158
- What is this?
- You wanna die? Fuck off, bitch!

864
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:32,897
Strip, nigger.
I wanna see your ass.

865
01:15:33,104 --> 01:15:37,473
Hurry up!
Take it all off! Now!

866
01:15:38,209 --> 01:15:41,235
I wanna see your ass.
Come on, faggot!

867
01:15:41,646 --> 01:15:44,240
Let's go, nigger!

868
01:15:54,225 --> 01:15:57,194
Show your ass to everyone!

869
01:15:57,795 --> 01:15:59,422
Please...

870
01:16:04,469 --> 01:16:07,029
- Strip, dammit!
- Hurry it up!

871
01:16:18,816 --> 01:16:22,183
What's up, Benny?
This camera for a bag of coke?

872
01:16:22,386 --> 01:16:27,016
- I don't deal anymore.
- C'mon, do it for me. You're my friend.

873
01:16:27,225 --> 01:16:29,887
- Is it stolen?
- It's okay, it's my dad's.

874
01:16:30,628 --> 01:16:32,619
Your dad's?

875
01:16:33,698 --> 01:16:38,931
- Give it to Li'l Z'.
- Rocket would love this camera.

876
01:16:43,074 --> 01:16:44,803
- Yeah, here.
- Great.

877
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:11,666
Here I am!

878
01:17:11,869 --> 01:17:13,996
- You wanna be a photographer?
- Yeah.

879
01:17:14,405 --> 01:17:19,206
- Here's a present.
- Shit, dude! This is great!

880
01:17:19,977 --> 01:17:24,175
Now move your ass.
Shake it!

881
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:46,226
You'll take some great pictures.

882
01:17:48,105 --> 01:17:50,073
Give me that.

883
01:17:55,313 --> 01:18:01,548
- Give me back the camera!
- No!

884
01:18:04,488 --> 01:18:11,155
What's your problem?
Are you crazy?

885
01:18:38,356 --> 01:18:41,917
They've killed Benny!

886
01:18:43,527 --> 01:18:48,464
Fuck! Call an ambulance!
Where's the motherfucker who did it?

887
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:54,294
- Z', Benny is dead.
- No! Call a doctor!

888
01:18:59,844 --> 01:19:04,440
Get out of here, bitch!
It's your fault!

889
01:19:06,717 --> 01:19:08,844
Motherfucker!

890
01:19:32,910 --> 01:19:35,344
Where's Carrot?

891
01:19:35,546 --> 01:19:37,207
Blacky's here.

892
01:19:39,617 --> 01:19:42,177
He's in trouble.

893
01:19:44,255 --> 01:19:45,984
I'm fucked.

894
01:19:46,457 --> 01:19:48,448
- Why?
- I'm fucked.

895
01:19:48,659 --> 01:19:51,526
And you are too.
I think I killed Benny.

896
01:19:51,729 --> 01:19:53,856
Li'l Z' is coming
to take your place.

897
01:19:54,065 --> 01:19:56,329
We can get him,
he's in the dance hall.

898
01:19:56,534 --> 01:19:58,161
You killed Benny?

899
01:19:58,369 --> 01:20:01,896
I didn't mean to. He moved.
I was aiming at Li'l Z'.

900
01:20:02,106 --> 01:20:04,267
Come on, let's go.

901
01:20:04,475 --> 01:20:06,966
Blacky...

902
01:20:07,178 --> 01:20:09,806
You killed the coolest
hood in the City of God.

903
01:20:10,014 --> 01:20:12,278
Let's go get Li'l Z'.

904
01:20:20,257 --> 01:20:24,921
Carrot knew that without Benny only
a miracle could save his business.

905
01:20:25,129 --> 01:20:28,223
We're fucked, man.

906
01:20:37,808 --> 01:20:43,110
But what better place for a miracle to
happen than in the City of God?

907
01:20:46,751 --> 01:20:48,651
Look who's here.
My sugar babe.

908
01:20:48,853 --> 01:20:50,514
- Let me by.
- Gimme a kiss, girl.

909
01:20:50,721 --> 01:20:54,680
Let me by, please.
Have you seen what you look like?

910
01:20:56,727 --> 01:20:59,787
Come on, Li'l Z'.

911
01:21:08,272 --> 01:21:10,763
Hi, honey.
Everything okay, baby?

912
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:25,082
The problem was simple. Li'l Z' was
ugly. Knockout Ned was handsome.

913
01:21:25,289 --> 01:21:31,353
Knockout Ned could get any girl.
Li'l Z' had to pay or use force.

914
01:21:32,029 --> 01:21:35,624
It was a duel between
the handsome good guy...

915
01:21:36,133 --> 01:21:37,998
and the ugly bad guy.

916
01:21:38,202 --> 01:21:40,762
- Let me go!
- Just enjoy it.

917
01:21:48,078 --> 01:21:53,539
There's no use fighting.
You're mine now.

918
01:21:57,788 --> 01:22:00,985
Hey, faggot, your broad's
really hot!

919
01:22:33,290 --> 01:22:35,588
I can't even look her in
the face now.

920
01:22:45,636 --> 01:22:49,072
Why didn't that fucker kill me?

921
01:22:53,177 --> 01:22:57,273
Hold on...
Why didn't I kill that fucker?

922
01:22:57,781 --> 01:22:59,646
Let's go back.

923
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:02,648
- What about Carrot?
- We'll get back to him.

924
01:23:02,853 --> 01:23:04,081
You gonna kill him?

925
01:23:07,791 --> 01:23:11,852
Knockout Ned, your chick's a slut.
Come out, motherfucker!

926
01:23:12,062 --> 01:23:17,500
- Come out, you loser!
- Take it easy...

927
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:21,831
l'm going out. Let me go.

928
01:23:35,286 --> 01:23:37,311
Gerson! Come back, son!

929
01:23:47,865 --> 01:23:51,733
This doesn't concern you, kid.
We're here for your brother.

930
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:55,303
Let's talk, we can work it out.
My brother's a peaceful guy.

931
01:23:55,506 --> 01:23:58,703
Is he too good-looking
to come talk to me? Call him.

932
01:23:58,909 --> 01:24:00,171
He hasn't done anything.

933
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:04,043
You know who I am?

934
01:24:04,248 --> 01:24:07,308
- Li'l Z', man.
- He's Li'l Z'.

935
01:24:07,918 --> 01:24:10,785
Call that motherfucker!

936
01:24:15,459 --> 01:24:18,326
Go on, man.

937
01:24:18,862 --> 01:24:21,126
Calm down, l'll call him.

938
01:24:54,732 --> 01:24:58,133
My arm! I hurt my arm.
Carrot will have to wait.

939
01:24:58,335 --> 01:25:00,667
That loser got what he deserved.

940
01:25:00,871 --> 01:25:02,862
Let's go!

941
01:25:26,597 --> 01:25:30,533
Gerson...

942
01:25:30,734 --> 01:25:34,329
That bastard killed my brother.

943
01:25:42,279 --> 01:25:45,043
I can't let that go.

944
01:26:00,264 --> 01:26:02,391
- Want a gun?
- My son...

945
01:26:02,599 --> 01:26:06,000
Calm down, mom.

946
01:26:06,837 --> 01:26:09,704
Please, mom...

947
01:26:18,515 --> 01:26:22,178
Do it right, asshole.

948
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:26,117
- There's no other way.
- How'd I let that loser hit me?

949
01:26:26,323 --> 01:26:28,791
Shit, that's some hole.

950
01:26:58,522 --> 01:27:01,514
- It's as if we were brothers.
- Shut up.

951
01:27:01,725 --> 01:27:06,253
Both of us hurt in the arm.
You by one brother, me the other.

952
01:27:06,463 --> 01:27:10,263
It would be really funny
if we were brothers.

953
01:27:10,467 --> 01:27:16,565
That Knockout Ned's not bad, eh?
He came out of nowhere.

954
01:27:17,341 --> 01:27:20,970
Shut up, Tuba!
You're a fucking pain!

955
01:27:28,519 --> 01:27:32,683
It was as if the City of God
had suddenly found a hero.

956
01:27:32,890 --> 01:27:35,051
God bless you, son.

957
01:27:35,259 --> 01:27:38,524
That kid was just asking
to be killed.

958
01:27:38,729 --> 01:27:41,425
Well done.

959
01:27:41,632 --> 01:27:44,863
You did a good job.

960
01:27:45,068 --> 01:27:48,697
You'd better go hide.

961
01:27:51,308 --> 01:27:54,573
I thought Knockout Ned
would start a revolution here.

962
01:27:54,778 --> 01:27:57,542
But God had other plans.

963
01:27:57,848 --> 01:28:01,443
Steak,
where are all the dealers?

964
01:28:01,652 --> 01:28:04,917
They're hiding.
Li'l Z' is in a bad mood.

965
01:28:05,122 --> 01:28:08,853
They get us hooked and then
they go off and hide.

966
01:28:09,059 --> 01:28:12,290
Do me a favor. Go get some
nose candy for me.

967
01:28:12,496 --> 01:28:13,895
I'll try.

968
01:28:14,097 --> 01:28:17,555
Tell them it's for Thiago,
to keep my buzz going.

969
01:28:38,154 --> 01:28:43,524
Steak'n'fries,
go to Carrot's and tell him...

970
01:28:43,726 --> 01:28:49,096
Li'l Z' says that if you kill
Knockout, he'll leave you alone.

971
01:28:49,732 --> 01:28:52,599
Hey, Knockout Ned.
Did you hear that?

972
01:28:52,802 --> 01:28:55,464
Grab the kid!

973
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:03,306
You heard the boy? If you don't
stick with us, you're dead.

974
01:29:03,513 --> 01:29:06,778
I think you should join us.
We'll be partners.

975
01:29:07,450 --> 01:29:10,385
Drugs aren't my thing.

976
01:29:10,587 --> 01:29:12,714
This is just something
between me and him.

977
01:29:12,922 --> 01:29:17,586
Those guys aren't worth shit.

978
01:29:17,794 --> 01:29:21,389
They'll do anything for power.

979
01:29:21,598 --> 01:29:23,930
Like that kid.

980
01:29:24,133 --> 01:29:28,263
They're all robots,
like this punk here.

981
01:29:28,471 --> 01:29:30,735
What's in your head, kid?

982
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:33,374
Can't you see you're
wrecking your life...

983
01:29:33,576 --> 01:29:37,808
with that maniac and a bunch
of trigger-happy fools?

984
01:29:39,282 --> 01:29:45,949
- Are you crazy? You're just a kid.
- A kid? I smoke, snort...

985
01:29:46,155 --> 01:29:49,454
l've killed and robbed.
I'm a man.

986
01:29:49,659 --> 01:29:52,184
Shit, you have no idea!

987
01:29:52,395 --> 01:29:55,626
He's attached to his gang.
You should join up with us.

988
01:29:55,832 --> 01:30:00,701
- Shall we kill him?
- Steak, we're going to grind you.

989
01:30:02,305 --> 01:30:06,537
- Okay, I accept.
- Great!

990
01:30:06,743 --> 01:30:10,839
Tell your boss that Knockout Ned
and Carrot are now in command.

991
01:30:11,047 --> 01:30:17,247
But on one condition:
No killing of innocent people.

992
01:30:18,888 --> 01:30:21,482
I can't accept that, understand?

993
01:30:21,691 --> 01:30:26,355
Okay, no innocent people.

994
01:30:27,764 --> 01:30:32,701
Steak fucked up!

995
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:46,974
- Have you a gun for me?
- No...

996
01:30:47,183 --> 01:30:50,584
but we can hold up
a gun store.

997
01:30:50,787 --> 01:30:52,846
That's no problem.

998
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:56,651
I don't want to hold up anything.
I'm not a hoodlum.

999
01:30:56,859 --> 01:31:00,056
This is a personal affair
between me and him, okay?

1000
01:31:00,730 --> 01:31:02,994
I'm not a hoodlum.

1001
01:31:05,368 --> 01:31:07,336
He raped your chick...

1002
01:31:07,537 --> 01:31:11,371
killed your uncle and brother,
gunned your house...

1003
01:31:11,574 --> 01:31:14,941
and you killed one of his guys.

1004
01:31:19,281 --> 01:31:22,910
If you're not a hood,
then get out.

1005
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:32,427
THE STORY OF KNOCKOUT NED

1006
01:31:33,595 --> 01:31:36,086
This is a hold-up!

1007
01:31:44,139 --> 01:31:47,768
- The first time...
- Where are the revolvers?

1008
01:31:47,976 --> 01:31:51,605
...Knockout Ned saved a salesclerk
from being shot by Carrot.

1009
01:31:51,813 --> 01:31:56,216
We said no killing!

1010
01:31:56,418 --> 01:31:58,215
That's the rule.

1011
01:31:59,454 --> 01:32:04,687
We want the boss' money. Everyone
keep calm. Open the cash register!

1012
01:32:04,893 --> 01:32:07,794
You want us to go?
We do too.

1013
01:32:07,996 --> 01:32:10,430
So hurry up!

1014
01:32:11,667 --> 01:32:14,067
- Look at the ground!
- The second time...

1015
01:32:14,269 --> 01:32:16,203
Carrot saved
Knockout Ned's life.

1016
01:32:18,974 --> 01:32:22,102
Ned learned that there's
an exception to every rule.

1017
01:32:22,744 --> 01:32:25,076
Exception to the rule.

1018
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:28,374
- Are you the manager?
- Yes.

1019
01:32:28,583 --> 01:32:32,576
This is a hold-up.
Everyone on the ground!

1020
01:32:32,788 --> 01:32:34,813
On the ground!

1021
01:32:35,023 --> 01:32:39,255
Give me the money!

1022
01:32:42,197 --> 01:32:44,427
I'm not kidding.

1023
01:32:44,633 --> 01:32:46,863
The first person who moves
is dead!

1024
01:32:47,269 --> 01:32:50,898
The third time, the exception
becomes the rule.

1025
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:11,057
Carrot and Knockout Ned
prepared to face Li'l Z'.

1026
01:33:11,259 --> 01:33:14,057
Carrot could protect his
business.

1027
01:33:14,329 --> 01:33:16,092
Knockout Ned...

1028
01:33:16,298 --> 01:33:19,233
the best marksman in his battalion,
wanted revenge.

1029
01:33:19,434 --> 01:33:23,632
First, the Italians.
This is a 9 mm.

1030
01:33:24,373 --> 01:33:26,603
- Let me see.
- Not bad, eh?

1031
01:33:26,808 --> 01:33:31,507
- The sight isn't well-aligned.
- I'll give you a good price.

1032
01:33:32,314 --> 01:33:34,305
The 12 mm, the "hand job".

1033
01:33:34,950 --> 01:33:36,178
See why?

1034
01:33:36,385 --> 01:33:39,445
An Uzi, 9 mm. It's Israeli.

1035
01:33:39,654 --> 01:33:42,521
- The star of David.
- Jewish.

1036
01:33:42,724 --> 01:33:44,089
I want a 30-06.

1037
01:33:44,559 --> 01:33:46,925
Now we can start having fun.

1038
01:33:47,129 --> 01:33:51,463
The war's on.
Let's start with a prayer.

1039
01:33:51,833 --> 01:33:55,929
Our Father who art in heaven
hallowed be our name...

1040
01:33:56,138 --> 01:34:00,302
Our will be done...

1041
01:34:00,842 --> 01:34:03,333
On earth as it is in heaven...

1042
01:34:16,591 --> 01:34:18,650
Hoodlums have guns,
but can't shoot.

1043
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:22,987
One bullet from Knockout Ned
was worth ten from Li'l Zs gang.

1044
01:34:23,198 --> 01:34:27,328
Li'l Z' couldn't take it.
He counter-attacked.

1045
01:34:29,971 --> 01:34:34,203
The ghetto had been a purgatory,
now it was hell.

1046
01:34:38,146 --> 01:34:43,846
I decided to get out.
That's how I became a reporter.

1047
01:34:44,719 --> 01:34:47,153
Great photo!

1048
01:34:47,355 --> 01:34:49,823
I bet it's by Rogerio Reis.

1049
01:34:50,392 --> 01:34:53,225
What did I tell you?

1050
01:34:53,428 --> 01:34:55,623
Like any pro...

1051
01:34:55,831 --> 01:34:59,267
I started at the bottom,
way down at the bottom.

1052
01:34:59,468 --> 01:35:02,926
Without knowing what awaited me.

1053
01:35:04,573 --> 01:35:07,542
Instead of going home
l'd go over to the paper.

1054
01:35:07,742 --> 01:35:11,109
A guy from the City of God
worked in the lab.

1055
01:35:11,313 --> 01:35:14,180
Check this out.

1056
01:35:14,382 --> 01:35:18,443
He helped me move closer to
what I loved most in life.

1057
01:35:18,653 --> 01:35:20,280
- Hi, Rogerio.
- How are you, Pierre?

1058
01:35:20,489 --> 01:35:23,117
This is Rocket.
He's a photographer.

1059
01:35:23,325 --> 01:35:24,485
Hello, Rocket.

1060
01:35:24,693 --> 01:35:26,957
- He's a fan of yours.
- Really?

1061
01:35:27,162 --> 01:35:28,789
You have good taste, Rocket!

1062
01:35:28,997 --> 01:35:32,091
- Well, l'm done. I'm off.
- See you.

1063
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:34,962
What a cool guy!

1064
01:35:35,770 --> 01:35:38,864
What should have been
a swift revenge...

1065
01:35:39,074 --> 01:35:41,565
turned into an all-out war.

1066
01:35:46,681 --> 01:35:48,911
The City of God was divided.

1067
01:35:49,117 --> 01:35:52,917
You couldn't go from one
section to the other.

1068
01:35:53,121 --> 01:35:55,351
Not even to visit a relative.

1069
01:35:55,557 --> 01:35:59,288
The cops considered anyone
living in the ghetto a hoodlum.

1070
01:35:59,494 --> 01:36:02,930
People got used to living
in Vietnam.

1071
01:36:07,135 --> 01:36:12,095
And more and more volunteers
kept signing up to die.

1072
01:36:12,307 --> 01:36:13,296
This kid...

1073
01:36:13,508 --> 01:36:16,238
- What do you want?
- A boy from Carrot's gang punched me.

1074
01:36:16,778 --> 01:36:18,143
The war was
an excuse for everything.

1075
01:36:18,547 --> 01:36:20,515
One of Li'l Zs soldiers
kicked me.

1076
01:36:22,551 --> 01:36:24,576
Take this.22.

1077
01:36:26,388 --> 01:36:28,856
The jerk who raped my sister is
with Carrot.

1078
01:36:29,057 --> 01:36:30,456
Li'l Z' evicted my family.

1079
01:36:31,493 --> 01:36:33,120
Kill... Be respected.

1080
01:36:45,507 --> 01:36:50,968
- I'm Thiago, a friend of Benny's.
- Can you read? Can you add?

1081
01:36:51,179 --> 01:36:56,617
- I'm pretty good in business.
- Okay, get to work.

1082
01:36:57,118 --> 01:37:00,485
- What do you want?
- To get my father's murderer.

1083
01:37:00,889 --> 01:37:03,653
- What's your name?
- My name's Otto.

1084
01:37:09,097 --> 01:37:11,065
What's the matter?

1085
01:37:11,266 --> 01:37:15,225
- He's a worker.
- But he wants a gun.

1086
01:37:15,971 --> 01:37:18,633
He won't last a week.

1087
01:37:29,651 --> 01:37:34,486
A year later, no one
remembered how it had all begun.

1088
01:37:34,689 --> 01:37:36,020
Take that!

1089
01:37:38,827 --> 01:37:44,766
For both sides, the aim was to take
over the enemy's business in order...

1090
01:37:44,966 --> 01:37:48,493
to buy more guns and take over
more businesses.

1091
01:38:10,325 --> 01:38:13,522
I smoke, snort,
l've killed and robbed.

1092
01:38:13,728 --> 01:38:16,060
I'm a man.

1093
01:38:37,719 --> 01:38:42,747
The media started taking an interest.
The police had to intervene.

1094
01:38:56,705 --> 01:39:01,108
A gang leader, from the City of God,
was arrested today.

1095
01:39:01,309 --> 01:39:03,038
Manuel Machado,
a.k.a. Knockout Ned...

1096
01:39:03,244 --> 01:39:06,645
was hospitalized after being
wounded by Li'l Zs gang.

1097
01:39:06,848 --> 01:39:09,078
Our reporter interviewed him.

1098
01:39:09,284 --> 01:39:13,243
- Is the war still going on?
- It's still going on.

1099
01:39:13,521 --> 01:39:18,049
- Have many people died?
- Many have died.

1100
01:39:18,259 --> 01:39:20,386
Mostly innocent people.

1101
01:39:20,595 --> 01:39:23,962
Just knowing me is enough...

1102
01:39:24,165 --> 01:39:28,898
to get you killed by Li'l Z'.

1103
01:39:29,104 --> 01:39:32,471
- The police don't go in there?
- They go after me, not him.

1104
01:39:32,674 --> 01:39:39,011
I've been in jail, while he goes
on killing undisturbed.

1105
01:39:39,214 --> 01:39:41,307
And they don't arrest him.

1106
01:39:41,516 --> 01:39:43,814
Knockout Ned says
the war will continue.

1107
01:39:44,018 --> 01:39:49,615
Police Chief Guedes has promised
to arrest both of the gangs.

1108
01:39:58,099 --> 01:39:59,828
Motherfucker!

1109
01:40:00,034 --> 01:40:03,595
I'm the boss here, but he gets
his picture in the paper!

1110
01:40:03,805 --> 01:40:07,366
- Have you found mine?
- Just Knockout Ned's.

1111
01:40:07,575 --> 01:40:09,042
Keep looking.

1112
01:40:09,444 --> 01:40:12,174
At least my name's
got to be in there.

1113
01:40:12,380 --> 01:40:14,075
- There's nothing.
- Can you read?

1114
01:40:14,282 --> 01:40:16,716
Just the pictures.

1115
01:40:17,685 --> 01:40:19,744
Nothing.

1116
01:40:19,954 --> 01:40:23,048
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

1117
01:40:23,258 --> 01:40:28,389
- It's just the want ads.
- I don't care, read everything!

1118
01:40:28,596 --> 01:40:32,760
- But there aren't any articles.
- Want a bullet in your head?

1119
01:40:34,769 --> 01:40:38,261
Gotta show them who's boss here.

1120
01:40:43,311 --> 01:40:47,008
- Give me the camera!
- No way!

1121
01:40:49,551 --> 01:40:51,883
Take my picture, man.

1122
01:40:52,487 --> 01:40:55,217
I can't work it.

1123
01:40:55,423 --> 01:40:57,118
Go ahead.

1124
01:40:57,492 --> 01:41:02,054
- I'll hold the Beretta.
- Let me try...

1125
01:41:02,697 --> 01:41:05,393
Back off...

1126
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:09,866
- There's no click.
- What a bunch of bozos!

1127
01:41:10,371 --> 01:41:13,135
I'm fucked with you guys.

1128
01:41:15,210 --> 01:41:17,770
I have an idea.

1129
01:41:17,979 --> 01:41:22,507
I'll go get a guy I know.
Hang loose.

1130
01:41:23,384 --> 01:41:27,286
- Here he is.
- Take the camera.

1131
01:41:27,989 --> 01:41:30,423
Well, kid?

1132
01:41:31,492 --> 01:41:36,896
Aren't you a photographer?
Make the camerawork. We can't do it.

1133
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:40,497
Take our picture.

1134
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:49,240
- You fucking broke it.
- It wasn't me.

1135
01:41:49,811 --> 01:41:51,506
I found it.

1136
01:41:53,348 --> 01:41:55,509
It has to be wound.

1137
01:41:59,954 --> 01:42:02,946
- What's your name?
- Rocket.

1138
01:42:03,324 --> 01:42:07,260
- Another picture, Rocket.
- How about two rows?

1139
01:42:07,462 --> 01:42:12,365
- What?
- Two rows. Everyone with their guns.

1140
01:42:13,134 --> 01:42:17,161
- You're outside, for Christ's sake!
- Talk to him nicely, kid.

1141
01:42:17,372 --> 01:42:19,306
Sorry. Move in, please.

1142
01:42:21,809 --> 01:42:24,277
Another one.

1143
01:42:28,650 --> 01:42:30,948
- I think the roll's finished.
- Then show us the pictures.

1144
01:42:31,152 --> 01:42:34,019
- They have to be developed.
- Developed?

1145
01:42:35,256 --> 01:42:36,917
How much is it?

1146
01:42:37,525 --> 01:42:41,928
Take this money.
And bring back the pictures.

1147
01:42:42,130 --> 01:42:47,397
- I have to remove the film.
- Keep the camera.

1148
01:42:47,902 --> 01:42:52,305
Benny wanted to give it to you,
didn't he? So, it's yours...

1149
01:42:52,507 --> 01:42:54,338
Thanks.

1150
01:42:56,277 --> 01:43:00,475
Don't forget the pictures.
The photos, Rocket!

1151
01:43:11,559 --> 01:43:13,891
- Pierre!
- What?

1152
01:43:14,295 --> 01:43:17,662
Can you develop this for me?

1153
01:43:18,366 --> 01:43:21,824
I can't, Rocket.
I could get into trouble.

1154
01:43:22,036 --> 01:43:24,766
It's only for the paper's reporters.
I could risk my job.

1155
01:43:24,973 --> 01:43:26,463
- Pierre?
- Yes, Rogerio?

1156
01:43:26,674 --> 01:43:31,304
Develop these for me.
This one too, okay?

1157
01:43:31,713 --> 01:43:34,079
I'm going to lunch.

1158
01:43:34,282 --> 01:43:38,378
You're lucky. What size?

1159
01:43:38,586 --> 01:43:41,987
- What?
- For the enlargement, what size?

1160
01:43:42,457 --> 01:43:46,257
Well... Whatever you think is best.

1161
01:44:06,047 --> 01:44:08,174
- Here.
- Thanks.

1162
01:44:12,053 --> 01:44:14,715
I'm in deep shit now.

1163
01:44:16,624 --> 01:44:19,149
I'm as good as dead.

1164
01:44:30,405 --> 01:44:32,498
Someone had signed
my death sentence.

1165
01:44:32,707 --> 01:44:36,165
I wanted to bash the jerk's face in.

1166
01:44:41,849 --> 01:44:45,478
Are you Marina?
Because of you l'm dead.

1167
01:44:45,686 --> 01:44:47,813
You stole my photos.

1168
01:44:48,022 --> 01:44:51,890
Dead? Stole? What do you mean?
Not so loud.

1169
01:44:53,194 --> 01:44:55,719
Not so loud?
I'll be killed because of you.

1170
01:44:55,930 --> 01:44:58,490
You were gone,
your photos were in the lab.

1171
01:44:58,699 --> 01:45:01,532
There's nothing I can do.
The photos in our lab...

1172
01:45:01,736 --> 01:45:04,534
are photos to be published
in the paper.

1173
01:45:04,739 --> 01:45:08,004
I saw the photos,
I published them.

1174
01:45:08,209 --> 01:45:10,609
- You stole them.
- I did not. Here they are.

1175
01:45:10,812 --> 01:45:15,181
- Give them to me.
- Just a second.

1176
01:45:15,383 --> 01:45:18,511
Here are your photos.

1177
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:22,485
- Are there any others?
- Calm down. What's your name?

1178
01:45:22,924 --> 01:45:25,984
- Rocket.
- Rocket?

1179
01:45:26,694 --> 01:45:29,094
Nice to meet you.
I'm Marina.

1180
01:45:29,297 --> 01:45:34,792
Now, relax. I have money for you.
For your pictures.

1181
01:45:35,203 --> 01:45:40,231
Here, when we use a picture
we pay the photographer.

1182
01:45:40,441 --> 01:45:43,467
- Do you want to be a photographer?
- Yes.

1183
01:45:43,678 --> 01:45:47,546
- Great start! On the front page.
- How'd you get these photos?

1184
01:45:47,748 --> 01:45:49,306
- I live there.
- Rocket...

1185
01:45:49,851 --> 01:45:53,753
no photographer has ever been able
to go in there.

1186
01:45:55,223 --> 01:45:59,853
If you could bring us
more pictures of Li'l Z'...

1187
01:46:00,061 --> 01:46:05,089
the paper would buy them.
We'd pay you.

1188
01:46:05,299 --> 01:46:07,358
Could you?

1189
01:46:07,568 --> 01:46:09,433
I don't know.

1190
01:46:09,737 --> 01:46:11,102
What's the problem?

1191
01:46:11,305 --> 01:46:14,138
The problem? I can't go there
anymore at night.

1192
01:46:14,342 --> 01:46:18,608
- And during the day?
- It's too risky.

1193
01:46:20,214 --> 01:46:25,743
Look, man! They've finally
understood that l'm the boss.

1194
01:46:27,388 --> 01:46:29,185
What's your
photographer-friend's name?

1195
01:46:29,390 --> 01:46:30,618
Rocket.

1196
01:46:30,825 --> 01:46:34,022
He's good. I'll take more
to show the others.

1197
01:46:37,198 --> 01:46:40,463
So, Rocket, is it yes or no?

1198
01:46:42,737 --> 01:46:45,706
It's a great opportunity.

1199
01:46:47,642 --> 01:46:49,041
Okay.

1200
01:46:50,278 --> 01:46:54,874
- You made the right choice. Very good!
- I'll give you some film, lenses...

1201
01:46:55,082 --> 01:47:00,782
and even another camera.
I'll show you the equipment room.

1202
01:47:00,988 --> 01:47:04,253
There's another problem.

1203
01:47:04,458 --> 01:47:07,484
- What is it?
- Where can I sleep tonight?

1204
01:47:08,262 --> 01:47:10,924
I can't go back now.

1205
01:47:13,768 --> 01:47:18,262
This is a 135 mm.
Will you be close up or far away?

1206
01:47:18,472 --> 01:47:19,461
Far away.

1207
01:47:19,941 --> 01:47:22,466
- Can you measure the light?
- Yes.

1208
01:47:24,579 --> 01:47:27,377
Aren't you too close?

1209
01:47:29,550 --> 01:47:33,418
I don't know what spurred me
to go talk to them like that.

1210
01:47:33,621 --> 01:47:35,816
Maybe I was going to die...

1211
01:47:36,023 --> 01:47:39,424
but now I had a camera...

1212
01:47:39,627 --> 01:47:42,323
and a chance to become
a photographer.

1213
01:47:42,897 --> 01:47:45,297
Watch out for the dog shit.

1214
01:47:45,733 --> 01:47:48,964
Not to mention that
the night was still young...

1215
01:47:49,170 --> 01:47:52,537
- Want something to eat?
- No thank you, ma'am.

1216
01:47:52,740 --> 01:47:58,440
Nothing to eat? Nothing to drink?
A joint?

1217
01:47:59,714 --> 01:48:01,477
Try this...

1218
01:48:20,268 --> 01:48:22,395
It's time to go to sleep.

1219
01:48:24,438 --> 01:48:27,771
I'll show you your bed.

1220
01:48:27,975 --> 01:48:31,001
- You have hot water, don't you?
- Yes.

1221
01:48:31,212 --> 01:48:33,703
You've never taken a hot shower?

1222
01:48:33,914 --> 01:48:36,144
- No.
- What do you do?

1223
01:48:36,350 --> 01:48:39,581
We heat up the kettle.

1224
01:48:39,787 --> 01:48:43,655
- Why are you standing there?
- What room do I sleep in?

1225
01:48:43,858 --> 01:48:49,990
Unfortunately, there's only one room.
You have to sleep with me.

1226
01:48:50,197 --> 01:48:53,860
I won't go into the details
of my first sexual experience.

1227
01:48:54,068 --> 01:48:57,162
Just relax...

1228
01:48:57,772 --> 01:48:59,672
Because, elsewhere...

1229
01:48:59,874 --> 01:49:04,538
another more important sex scene
for the ghetto was taking place.

1230
01:49:05,980 --> 01:49:08,278
Carrot was helping
Knockout Ned escape...

1231
01:49:08,482 --> 01:49:11,110
without firing a shot.

1232
01:49:12,553 --> 01:49:18,549
The policeman guarding him was
in the willing hands of the nurse.

1233
01:49:19,226 --> 01:49:20,318
And in the meantime...

1234
01:49:20,528 --> 01:49:23,929
to eliminate Carrot, Li'l Z'
was investing in munitions.

1235
01:49:24,131 --> 01:49:26,861
He invested heavily,
even if he couldn't pay...

1236
01:49:28,167 --> 01:49:31,568
- Remember the double-barrel?
- I already have it.

1237
01:49:31,771 --> 01:49:36,538
This is a repeater rifle. You don't have
this one, the Browning.

1238
01:49:36,776 --> 01:49:39,836
- It'll shoot down a plane.
- I'm not shooting down planes.

1239
01:49:40,046 --> 01:49:43,345
And the one I asked for?
The AR-15, Uncle Sam.

1240
01:49:44,116 --> 01:49:46,983
You can't get them in Brazil.

1241
01:49:47,186 --> 01:49:49,177
My ass, Uncle Sam.

1242
01:49:52,124 --> 01:49:54,354
I have a solution.

1243
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:56,255
The Rugger. Ever seen one?

1244
01:49:56,462 --> 01:50:00,990
It's like the AR-15.
Same caliber, but lighter.

1245
01:50:01,200 --> 01:50:04,601
With an infrared sight?
400 shots a minute?

1246
01:50:04,804 --> 01:50:07,637
- It depends.
- It depends, my ass!

1247
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:10,400
Trying to fuck me over?

1248
01:50:10,743 --> 01:50:12,608
I'll fuck you over first.

1249
01:50:12,812 --> 01:50:15,713
You leave now without the money
or the guns.

1250
01:50:16,782 --> 01:50:19,444
- What do I tell the boss?
- That's your problem.

1251
01:50:19,652 --> 01:50:23,816
- You'll think of something.
- You heard him, chubby? Get out.

1252
01:50:24,290 --> 01:50:27,555
Beat it, fatso.

1253
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:29,318
Li'l Z' had made a big mistake.

1254
01:50:29,529 --> 01:50:33,829
He should have known that behind
every salesman lies a supplier.

1255
01:50:34,033 --> 01:50:36,263
And they don't joke around.

1256
01:50:37,770 --> 01:50:40,330
Have you seen this?

1257
01:50:40,740 --> 01:50:43,106
What do they need an AR-15 for?

1258
01:50:43,309 --> 01:50:46,278
These stories will push
the police to investigate.

1259
01:50:46,479 --> 01:50:48,743
They'll nab you.
And me, along with you.

1260
01:50:48,948 --> 01:50:53,578
Think l'm going
to give you away?

1261
01:50:56,756 --> 01:50:59,350
Don't worry,
l'll take care of it.

1262
01:50:59,559 --> 01:51:01,720
But don't fuck up again.

1263
01:51:08,501 --> 01:51:10,662
Charlie!

1264
01:51:11,370 --> 01:51:13,270
Come here!

1265
01:51:13,472 --> 01:51:15,030
Listen...

1266
01:51:15,241 --> 01:51:17,937
you tell him...

1267
01:51:18,711 --> 01:51:22,841
Let's go make that sleazy
little dealer pay up.

1268
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:36,588
Come here, kids!

1269
01:51:38,664 --> 01:51:42,191
- Do you like chicken?
- It depends.

1270
01:51:42,401 --> 01:51:45,802
We'll eat some chicken
and have Carrot for dessert.

1271
01:51:46,005 --> 01:51:49,338
I have a present for you.

1272
01:51:51,410 --> 01:51:53,105
Here...

1273
01:51:54,947 --> 01:51:56,938
A big one for you.

1274
01:51:57,149 --> 01:51:59,174
Are you really giving us
these guns?

1275
01:51:59,385 --> 01:52:04,118
Yes, but I want you on my side,
against Carrot.

1276
01:52:04,323 --> 01:52:07,053
Then can we hold up
anyone we want?

1277
01:52:07,259 --> 01:52:09,955
Not in the ghetto.
Can you shoot?

1278
01:52:10,162 --> 01:52:11,959
- More or less.
- More or less?

1279
01:52:12,164 --> 01:52:17,625
Hey, you guys, come help
these kids.

1280
01:52:19,138 --> 01:52:21,129
I know. You do it like this.

1281
01:52:27,279 --> 01:52:29,679
THE BEGINNING OF THE END

1282
01:52:38,391 --> 01:52:39,380
Get that chicken!

1283
01:52:52,672 --> 01:52:53,866
C'mon, let's go.

1284
01:52:54,073 --> 01:52:56,007
If Li'l Z' catches you,
he'll kill you.

1285
01:52:58,010 --> 01:53:00,877
Yeah, well, he's gotta
find me first.

1286
01:53:08,754 --> 01:53:12,019
Hey, kid! Get that chicken!

1287
01:53:14,660 --> 01:53:16,150
Shit! The cops!

1288
01:53:16,362 --> 01:53:18,421
Hell, don't fucking run off!

1289
01:53:18,631 --> 01:53:20,496
Give me that.

1290
01:53:31,744 --> 01:53:34,110
Hey, Melonhead! You fucking fag!

1291
01:53:34,313 --> 01:53:37,441
Get the hell out of here!

1292
01:53:37,650 --> 01:53:39,015
Coward!

1293
01:53:39,218 --> 01:53:41,243
Asshole!

1294
01:53:42,188 --> 01:53:45,123
Come on, let them kill each other.

1295
01:53:45,324 --> 01:53:48,054
They can fuck themselves.

1296
01:53:56,202 --> 01:53:58,693
Rocket! Take a picture of us!

1297
01:54:00,106 --> 01:54:02,404
What are you waiting for?

1298
01:54:23,996 --> 01:54:25,759
What's happening?

1299
01:54:26,132 --> 01:54:27,531
Shit!

1300
01:54:40,613 --> 01:54:42,513
Let's go!

1301
01:55:14,547 --> 01:55:17,209
Run! Run!

1302
01:55:17,416 --> 01:55:20,283
Watch out!

1303
01:55:20,486 --> 01:55:23,478
Kill one of these faggots!
Blast him!

1304
01:55:43,142 --> 01:55:45,576
Knockout Ned!

1305
01:55:59,358 --> 01:56:02,156
Take it easy. Don't move.

1306
01:56:02,361 --> 01:56:04,090
It hurts, man.

1307
01:56:04,296 --> 01:56:06,856
Easy does it, kid.

1308
01:56:07,867 --> 01:56:10,529
Why did you join this fucking war?

1309
01:56:10,736 --> 01:56:13,466
Knockout Ned!
Li'l Z' has been hit. Come on!

1310
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:17,832
Wait here, l'll help you.
Just hold on.

1311
01:56:27,052 --> 01:56:31,352
- What's your name?
- My name's Otto.

1312
01:56:38,397 --> 01:56:41,389
I want to get my father's murderer.

1313
01:57:05,991 --> 01:57:08,459
Knockout Ned! Li'l Z' has been hit.
Come on!

1314
01:57:09,828 --> 01:57:14,162
I'll help you.
Just hold on there.

1315
01:57:53,305 --> 01:57:56,638
The fucking cops!

1316
01:57:56,842 --> 01:57:58,275
On the ground!

1317
01:57:58,477 --> 01:58:00,377
- Hands over your head.
- Don't move!

1318
01:58:08,620 --> 01:58:14,923
- You're the one I want.
- You're finished, pal.

1319
01:58:15,127 --> 01:58:17,186
Handcuff him.

1320
01:58:34,179 --> 01:58:35,737
Rocket, where are you going?

1321
01:58:35,948 --> 01:58:38,416
I got something to clear up.

1322
01:59:09,815 --> 01:59:11,339
Okay, lovebirds?

1323
01:59:11,550 --> 01:59:15,247
Come on, Li'l Z',
let's go settle our scores.

1324
01:59:16,088 --> 01:59:20,184
Not you. You're a present
for the media.

1325
01:59:56,295 --> 01:59:57,728
Does it come to 10,000?

1326
01:59:57,930 --> 02:00:00,990
Almost. That's all I have.

1327
02:00:01,200 --> 02:00:04,567
- That's all there was, Chief.
- We searched everywhere.

1328
02:00:04,770 --> 02:00:07,261
Let him go.

1329
02:00:11,677 --> 02:00:14,578
What about this ring?
Is it gold?

1330
02:00:14,780 --> 02:00:20,685
Fill it up. You'll owe us
the rest.

1331
02:00:24,456 --> 02:00:26,686
Fucking war!

1332
02:00:28,927 --> 02:00:31,487
Knockout Ned is dead
and I'm dead broke!

1333
02:00:31,697 --> 02:00:33,961
You're fucked, eh?

1334
02:00:34,166 --> 02:00:35,428
Kids...

1335
02:00:35,634 --> 02:00:39,536
we'll have to do a few hold-ups
to get my business going again.

1336
02:00:39,738 --> 02:00:42,673
- Your business, Li'l Z'?
- What's your problem, kid?

1337
02:00:42,875 --> 02:00:45,537
This is for our friend,
motherfucker!

1338
02:00:45,744 --> 02:00:47,268
A Soviet attack!

1339
02:00:54,586 --> 02:00:57,521
The business is ours!

1340
02:01:51,310 --> 02:01:55,610
This picture of the hood
will get me the job.

1341
02:01:57,950 --> 02:01:59,815
This one will make me famous.

1342
02:02:00,018 --> 02:02:02,782
It'll even make the cover
of a magazine.

1343
02:02:05,090 --> 02:02:08,685
I won't have to worry
about Li'l Z' anymore.

1344
02:02:10,629 --> 02:02:13,325
But the cops?

1345
02:02:20,672 --> 02:02:25,109
GANGSTER, SELF-STYLED "BOSS"
OF THE CITY OF GOD, SHOT DEAD

1346
02:02:27,546 --> 02:02:32,142
This photo could've gotten
us killed?

1347
02:02:32,351 --> 02:02:33,909
I think so.

1348
02:02:34,119 --> 02:02:36,815
At least it got you a job.

1349
02:02:37,022 --> 02:02:40,856
- Not a job, an internship.
- It pays a little, doesn't it?

1350
02:02:41,059 --> 02:02:43,493
A little.

1351
02:02:43,762 --> 02:02:46,731
What about that lady journalist?
Was she a good lay?

1352
02:02:46,932 --> 02:02:49,298
- More or less.
- You didn't like it?

1353
02:02:49,501 --> 02:02:51,935
I don't think journalists know how
to screw.

1354
02:02:52,137 --> 02:02:53,126
Yeah, I guess so.

1355
02:02:53,338 --> 02:02:55,704
Cocoa robbed 3 houses in Barra.

1356
02:02:55,907 --> 02:02:57,499
Better kill him.

1357
02:02:57,709 --> 02:02:59,370
Who shot Roger?

1358
02:02:59,578 --> 02:03:01,910
- It was Beef.
- Kill that fucker.

1359
02:03:02,114 --> 02:03:04,480
We should kill the Chief
and Gringo as well.

1360
02:03:04,683 --> 02:03:08,175
- What about Cherry?
- Let's go. Us two, and 3 others...

1361
02:03:08,387 --> 02:03:10,252
It's a deal.

1362
02:03:10,455 --> 02:03:13,049
Have you heard
of the Red Brigade?

1363
02:03:13,258 --> 02:03:16,557
No, but if they come,
we'll kill them.

1364
02:03:16,928 --> 02:03:21,194
- Who knows how to write?
- Me, sort of.

1365
02:03:21,600 --> 02:03:24,433
Let's make a black list.
We'll kill them all.

1366
02:03:24,636 --> 02:03:28,197
- Put fucking Nightowl on there.
- And Croquet.

1367
02:03:28,407 --> 02:03:29,931
Leonard, too, he owes me money.

1368
02:03:30,142 --> 02:03:32,076
And China-Man,
he thinks he's hot stuff.

1369
02:03:32,277 --> 02:03:35,269
- And Claudio.
- Where's Giant?

1370
02:03:35,480 --> 02:03:38,210
Come on, Giant!

1371
02:03:52,664 --> 02:03:56,327
I forgot to say,
my name isn't Rocket anymore.

1372
02:03:56,535 --> 02:03:58,765
BASED ON A REAL STORY
l'm now Wilson Rodrigues...

1373
02:03:58,970 --> 02:04:00,665
photographer.

1374
02:04:21,693 --> 02:04:23,490
Manuel Machado,
a.k.a. Knockout Ned...

1375
02:04:23,695 --> 02:04:26,789
was hospitalized after
being wounded by Li'l Zs gang.

1376
02:04:26,998 --> 02:04:29,990
On leaving the hospital,
our reporter interviewed him.

1377
02:04:30,202 --> 02:04:33,262
Many have died.
Mostly innocent people.

1378
02:04:33,472 --> 02:04:37,101
Just knowing me is enough...

1379
02:04:37,309 --> 02:04:41,143
just being my friend...

1380
02:04:41,346 --> 02:04:45,282
If he thinks someone knows me,
he'll kill them.

1381
02:04:45,484 --> 02:04:47,384
The police don't go in there?

1382
02:04:47,586 --> 02:04:52,956
