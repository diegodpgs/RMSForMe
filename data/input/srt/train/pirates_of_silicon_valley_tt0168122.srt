1
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,597
I don't want you to think
of this as just a film...

2
00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:37,204
...some process of converting
electrons and magnetic impulses...

3
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,429
...into shapes and figures
and sounds.

4
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:41,573
No. Listen to me.

5
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,573
We're here to make
a dent in the universe.

6
00:00:45,743 --> 00:00:47,869
Otherwise, why even be here?

7
00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:50,569
We're creating a completely
new consciousness...

8
00:00:50,746 --> 00:00:53,475
...like an artist or a poet.

9
00:00:53,648 --> 00:00:55,479
That's how you have to think of this.

10
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,812
We're rewriting the history of human
thought with what we're doing.

11
00:00:58,985 --> 00:01:01,476
Right. Well, Steven, at the moment
I'm more worried...

12
00:01:01,654 --> 00:01:05,383
...about getting light on the actress.
You know what I mean?

13
00:01:08,124 --> 00:01:10,024
Simon. Excuse me a second.

14
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,363
- Michelle.
- Yeah?

15
00:01:17,531 --> 00:01:20,090
Michelle, walk...
Yes, walk towards lens slowly.

16
00:01:20,266 --> 00:01:21,927
Like this?

17
00:01:23,201 --> 00:01:26,692
Okay. Right. Right.

18
00:01:37,378 --> 00:01:40,403
<i>I always wondered what it
must have been like for Steve. </i>

19
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:43,275
I mean, ever since we were kids,
everything he ever did...

20
00:01:43,448 --> 00:01:47,110
...was somewhere between a religious
experience and some sort of crusade.

21
00:01:47,384 --> 00:01:48,681
<i>Like with this commercial. </i>

22
00:01:48,852 --> 00:01:52,184
<i>It was practically a legend
from the time Ridley Scott filmed it. </i>

23
00:01:52,354 --> 00:01:55,016
<i>Like the book, 1984,
with all the downtrodden masses... </i>

24
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,680
<i>... and that one huge spark
of rebellion... </i>

25
00:01:57,858 --> 00:02:01,122
<i>... against the evil Big Brother
who ran everything. </i>

26
00:02:02,394 --> 00:02:03,827
Go, go, go.

27
00:02:04,762 --> 00:02:06,593
Smoke it up, please.

28
00:02:07,597 --> 00:02:09,827
And you three.
That's right, you'll come with me.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,433
The rest of you stay in the back.

30
00:02:28,277 --> 00:02:32,212
<i>- is a more powerful weapon
than any fleet or army on Earth. </i>

31
00:02:32,881 --> 00:02:35,872
<i>We are one people with one will. </i>

32
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,382
<i>One resolve. One cause. </i>

33
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:42,109
<i>Our enemies shall talk
themselves to death... </i>

34
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:46,881
<i>... and we will bury them
with their own confusion. </i>

35
00:02:47,057 --> 00:02:50,321
<i>We shall prevail. </i>

36
00:02:54,995 --> 00:02:56,394
<i>And then 13 years later... </i>

37
00:02:56,563 --> 00:02:59,759
<i>... Steve has to stand up
on that stage in Boston. </i>

38
00:02:59,932 --> 00:03:01,421
<i>Man, that was... </i>

39
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,295
<i>That was weird. </i>

40
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:05,565
The era...

41
00:03:05,803 --> 00:03:09,794
...of competition between us is over.

42
00:03:11,073 --> 00:03:12,903
Thank you, Bill.

43
00:03:13,374 --> 00:03:15,432
Thank you for standing with us.

44
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:18,077
The world's a better place
because of it.

45
00:03:18,245 --> 00:03:20,769
Microsoft is gonna ruin Apple.
You can't trust them.

46
00:03:20,946 --> 00:03:22,435
I know.

47
00:03:22,614 --> 00:03:27,311
I realize that this news
may be shocking to some of you.

48
00:03:27,483 --> 00:03:29,849
<i>I mean,
Steve talking to Bill Gates... </i>

49
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:33,044
<i>... who's staring down
like he's Big Brother, and he was. </i>

50
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,916
<i>For years, Steve almost went crazy
over what Bill was doing to him... </i>

51
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,024
<i>... and now he's up there on that stage,
in front of the world... </i>

52
00:03:39,191 --> 00:03:42,125
<i>... telling everybody he's practically
the Second Coming. </i>

53
00:03:43,094 --> 00:03:45,618
<i>I mean, how do you get
from there to here?</i>

54
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:54,697
<i>There was a disturbance
on the campus... </i>

55
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,397
<i>... of the University
of California at Berkeley. </i>

56
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,631
<i>The Santa Barbara campus
reported a small-scale riot as well. </i>

57
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:05,640
<i>- The demonstrators said they were...
- More than 400 students... </i>

58
00:04:05,809 --> 00:04:08,277
<i>... have taken part
in the demonstration. </i>

59
00:04:10,512 --> 00:04:14,345
<i>In the morning, police began launching
tear-gas grenades to break up the crowd. </i>

60
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:17,449
<i>Student leaders are anxious
to meet with university officials... </i>

61
00:04:17,616 --> 00:04:19,516
<i>... to express their views on Vietnam. </i>

62
00:04:19,852 --> 00:04:22,945
- What the hell are we doing here?
- Let's get out of here.

63
00:04:24,588 --> 00:04:26,987
Stay back. Hold it.
Hold it there. Get back.

64
00:04:58,911 --> 00:05:00,901
- Don't drop the box!
- I'm not!

65
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,545
Come on.

66
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,177
You okay?

67
00:05:15,522 --> 00:05:17,648
Those guys think
they're revolutionaries.

68
00:05:17,823 --> 00:05:19,552
- They're not. We are.
- We are?

69
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,025
<i>You know, Steve was
never like you or me. </i>

70
00:05:22,193 --> 00:05:25,491
<i>He always saw things differently. 
Even then when I was in Berkeley... </i>

71
00:05:25,662 --> 00:05:28,687
<i>... I'd see something and just see
kilobytes or circuit boards... </i>

72
00:05:28,864 --> 00:05:31,889
<i>... while he'd see karma or the meaning
of the universe. </i>

73
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,497
<i>Steve and I found this weird guy
who was a hero around Berkeley... </i>

74
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:39,899
<i>... all because he found a way
to beat the system. </i>

75
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:42,005
<i>This guy was called Captain Crunch... </i>

76
00:05:42,173 --> 00:05:45,801
...because he figured out
this little whistle...

77
00:05:45,976 --> 00:05:48,409
...that you found in boxes
of Cap'n Crunch cereal...

78
00:05:48,577 --> 00:05:51,773
...had the same tones as AT&T's
long-distance equipment.

79
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,146
<i>So you got free phone calls
anywhere in the world... </i>

80
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:57,680
<i>... with this thing I built
called the blue box. </i>

81
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,976
<i>And then we tested it out
by calling the pope. </i>

82
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,482
- You talk to him.
- No, no, no.

83
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,483
They're putting you
through to the pope?

84
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,121
I totally figured it out, man.

85
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:10,024
I figured it out. I know what it's about.
You know what it's about?

86
00:06:11,292 --> 00:06:13,192
It's about power.

87
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,123
Right on, man.

88
00:06:15,428 --> 00:06:17,054
It's like those weird countries...

89
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:19,890
...where the army guys
overthrow the president.

90
00:06:20,064 --> 00:06:22,089
The first thing that they take over...

91
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:26,725
...are the ways people communicate,
you know, radio, TV, newspapers.

92
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,633
Far-out, man.

93
00:06:29,137 --> 00:06:31,400
Information is power.

94
00:06:34,707 --> 00:06:37,300
<i>I kept building the boxes,
and Steve kept selling them... </i>

95
00:06:37,476 --> 00:06:40,103
<i>... until one day, we almost
got busted by some cops... </i>

96
00:06:40,278 --> 00:06:43,974
<i>... who, thank God, didn't even
know what a blue box was. </i>

97
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:49,045
You might wanna try a haircut, boys.

98
00:06:49,717 --> 00:06:53,516
<i>So I started trying to build something
that wasn't gonna get us in trouble. </i>

99
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:56,147
- That's not a blue box.
- It's a computer.

100
00:06:56,322 --> 00:06:58,846
Woz, we need blue boxes,
not computers.

101
00:06:59,024 --> 00:07:01,992
<i>- I got a reporter from Mercury News coming.
- What for?</i>

102
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:06,094
My mom phoned, told them I was building
a computer, and they wanna do a story.

103
00:07:06,262 --> 00:07:07,819
Woz, give me a break.

104
00:07:07,996 --> 00:07:11,431
Hey, let me ask you something,
seriously. Look at me.

105
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,658
Do you wanna get stuck here
the rest of your life in this hellhole?

106
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,927
Look, this is where I grew up, okay?
It's not a hellhole. Shoot.

107
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:20,900
I know your newspaper will find
Steve's computer fascinating.

108
00:07:21,072 --> 00:07:23,471
He's so ingenious.
He built it all from spare parts.

109
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,197
Steven, the reporter is...

110
00:07:26,943 --> 00:07:28,773
Hi. It caught fire.

111
00:07:28,944 --> 00:07:32,902
My first chance at fame,
and the computer catches fire.

112
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,047
Sorry.

113
00:07:38,984 --> 00:07:40,450
<i>When I was still at Berkeley... </i>

114
00:07:40,618 --> 00:07:42,608
<i>... I kept making
weird electronic gadgets... </i>

115
00:07:42,786 --> 00:07:45,413
<i>... that were basically just jokes. </i>

116
00:07:46,855 --> 00:07:49,687
<i>But, hey, you know, jokes are important. </i>

117
00:07:54,927 --> 00:07:57,986
<i>The problem back then was
me and Steve and his girlfriend... </i>

118
00:07:58,163 --> 00:07:59,391
<i>... were pretty much broke. </i>

119
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:03,430
<i>So we ended up doing some pretty
nutty things just to make money. </i>

120
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,192
I know where we can get a job.

121
00:08:05,368 --> 00:08:07,995
- Saw it on the bulletin board there.
- What kind of job?

122
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,694
I don't know. It seems
sort of like show business.

123
00:08:11,172 --> 00:08:15,470
<i>Dressing up as Alice in Wonderland
and stuff for a bunch of kids?</i>

124
00:08:18,243 --> 00:08:21,211
<i>But, you know, Steve wasn't
exactly cut out for that stuff. </i>

125
00:08:27,515 --> 00:08:29,210
Maybe in a past life...

126
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:32,113
...I was a poet or an artist.

127
00:08:32,286 --> 00:08:36,277
You know, maybe you talk about
past lives and all that stuff...

128
00:08:36,455 --> 00:08:38,513
...because, well,
you don't know who you are.

129
00:08:39,624 --> 00:08:42,524
What the hell are you talking about?
I don't know who I am?

130
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:45,222
Well, you don't.
I mean, you told me...

131
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:47,827
I don't wanna talk about it
with you or anyone else.

132
00:08:48,229 --> 00:08:50,163
I'm just trying to help.

133
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:59,294
It wasn't like Steve and I
lost touch with each other...

134
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,700
...but he was definitely
in places I wasn't...

135
00:09:02,238 --> 00:09:03,830
...like some ashram in India...

136
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:07,533
...and communes up in Oregon
where they picked apples all day.

137
00:09:07,976 --> 00:09:09,875
<i>It was pretty much
of a journey for Steve. </i>

138
00:09:10,044 --> 00:09:13,012
<i>The kind that's as much
on the inside as on the outside. </i>

139
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:16,841
<i>I mean, he definitely must
have been to weird places. </i>

140
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:27,078
See the new Playmate?
Miss October?

141
00:09:28,657 --> 00:09:31,250
Hey, man, Miss August is way better.

142
00:09:31,425 --> 00:09:33,153
Boobs out to here.

143
00:09:33,326 --> 00:09:36,522
Honest to God, Ballmer.
You have no culture.

144
00:09:37,162 --> 00:09:41,062
Yeah, right.
Like you go around reading Plato.

145
00:09:42,098 --> 00:09:43,531
You're the only guy I know...

146
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,497
<i>...who could make furniture
out of Playboys, for God sakes.</i>

147
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,898
Look, you got enough
to make a chair.

148
00:09:49,304 --> 00:09:51,294
You don't have to worry
about them moving...

149
00:09:51,471 --> 00:09:53,495
...because they're stuck together.
- Get out.

150
00:09:53,673 --> 00:09:56,072
<i>- They're all stuck together.
- Sometimes back then... </i>

151
00:09:56,241 --> 00:09:57,833
<i>... I could've throttled Bill Gates. </i>

152
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:00,841
The guy could turn any human situation
into a poker game.

153
00:10:01,011 --> 00:10:02,944
Forget about classes. Poker.

154
00:10:03,112 --> 00:10:05,909
The fact that the world might
end tonight? No problem, poker.

155
00:10:06,081 --> 00:10:08,981
Or we're finally deciphering
the meaning of life.

156
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,446
More poker.

157
00:10:10,617 --> 00:10:12,744
<i>And winning. The guy'd have
a hairball if he'd lost... </i>

158
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,715
<i>... which wasn't often,
let me tell you. </i>

159
00:10:14,887 --> 00:10:17,218
- Full house.
- Oh, man.

160
00:10:18,556 --> 00:10:20,113
Hey, Bill.

161
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:23,017
<i>Our rooms were like a casino. </i>

162
00:10:23,592 --> 00:10:25,354
<i>Actually, a messy casino. </i>

163
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:28,791
<i>And Bill slept wherever he fell down. </i>

164
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,865
Bill, the revolution's starting
without us.

165
00:10:37,035 --> 00:10:40,003
<i>Bill and Paul Allen had known
each other since they were kids. </i>

166
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,400
<i>If the word "passion"
entered into their lives... </i>

167
00:10:42,572 --> 00:10:44,698
<i>... it was for one thing: Computers. </i>

168
00:10:44,873 --> 00:10:48,706
<i>Especially this one made by some guy
in Albuquerque of all places. </i>

169
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,300
What is this, porn for engineers?

170
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:55,539
Oh, jeez, the Altair.

171
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,809
Am I missing something?

172
00:10:57,981 --> 00:11:01,780
I mean, Miss October, I can understand,
but what is this?

173
00:11:02,285 --> 00:11:04,684
This is better than Miss October.

174
00:11:06,455 --> 00:11:07,682
This is a computer.

175
00:11:07,855 --> 00:11:09,947
- Oh, God.
- The article says...

176
00:11:10,123 --> 00:11:12,886
...that they need someone
to figure out a language for it.

177
00:11:13,058 --> 00:11:16,083
Right now
it just sits there and blinks.

178
00:11:19,863 --> 00:11:23,457
Whoever talks to this Ed Roberts
has gotta go to Albuquerque to see him.

179
00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:26,657
You should go because you look
better for that stuff than I do.

180
00:11:27,168 --> 00:11:29,135
- I do not.
- You both look terrible.

181
00:11:29,303 --> 00:11:31,736
- Just get used to it.
- What are we supposed to do?

182
00:11:31,904 --> 00:11:34,929
It's simple.
You call him and say you're Paul.

183
00:11:35,107 --> 00:11:37,666
And then Paul goes to Albuquerque
and says he's Paul.

184
00:11:45,446 --> 00:11:46,913
So, what are you gonna say?

185
00:11:49,316 --> 00:11:51,374
Hi, Mr. Ed Roberts, please.

186
00:11:51,684 --> 00:11:55,449
This is Paul Allen, calling
from Cambridge, Massachusetts.

187
00:11:57,354 --> 00:12:00,686
It's our job to find out what this guy
doesn't know that he needs...

188
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,851
...but does need and make sure
he knows he does need it...

189
00:12:04,025 --> 00:12:06,549
...and that we're the only ones
to give him the answer.

190
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,217
What?

191
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:13,020
- Mr. Roberts?
- Yes, sir, Mr. Allen.

192
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:16,997
I tell you, I believe that we've
got one hot product here.

193
00:12:17,168 --> 00:12:20,603
The reason I can speak that way is
because I've taken over 50 calls...

194
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:23,966
...from people wanting to come to
work with us on this Altair project.

195
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,564
So here's the deal.

196
00:12:28,275 --> 00:12:31,266
I snuck two women into my room.

197
00:12:32,245 --> 00:12:33,609
And they're naked.

198
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:36,178
I mean, like, really naked.

199
00:12:36,347 --> 00:12:40,214
You know, like, gorgeous naked.

200
00:12:41,618 --> 00:12:43,608
So don't say I never
did anything for you...

201
00:12:43,786 --> 00:12:46,583
...because they're waiting
for you right now.

202
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:49,020
Drop dead, Ballmer.

203
00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:51,486
Oh, and I told them...

204
00:12:51,657 --> 00:12:54,420
...that you were writing
a computer language...

205
00:12:54,592 --> 00:12:57,059
...and right away,
they start moaning for it.

206
00:12:57,227 --> 00:12:59,888
"Oh, computer languages.

207
00:13:00,062 --> 00:13:01,427
Oh, Fortran.

208
00:13:01,597 --> 00:13:04,565
Oh, Fortran. "

209
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:07,991
Will you cut it out, Steve.

210
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:12,467
Excuse me, I'm just trying
to save you guys from...

211
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:15,871
...wasting your entire
Harvard reading week...

212
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,031
...over this Traf-O-Data simulator...

213
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:23,303
...while everyone else
is out getting drunk or laid.

214
00:13:24,546 --> 00:13:27,105
- Paul, are those parts binary?
- I give up. I give up.

215
00:13:27,281 --> 00:13:28,873
I give up. I give up.

216
00:14:10,176 --> 00:14:11,870
Oh, duck, Bill.

217
00:14:18,982 --> 00:14:22,382
Oh, you know, Bill, I think you gotta
come up with a better pickup line.

218
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:25,609
Asking her what her SAT score is
is definitely not gonna do it.

219
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,717
I forgot to write a loader.

220
00:14:27,888 --> 00:14:29,684
That's not an improvement, Bill.

221
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:33,016
No, no. I just realized something.
Paul's on his way to Albuquerque.

222
00:14:33,191 --> 00:14:36,353
I forgot to write the loader that connects
the computer to the Teletype.

223
00:14:36,694 --> 00:14:40,026
<i>And if he starts that machine,
and it can't read the tape, we're dead. </i>

224
00:14:44,565 --> 00:14:46,896
Unless he did it on the plane,
I'm finished.

225
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:49,364
- It's something I just realized.
- I hope so.

226
00:14:49,702 --> 00:14:52,727
If this Albuquerque thing had worked,
I was gonna quit Harvard.

227
00:14:53,938 --> 00:14:55,461
Are you crazy?

228
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:58,072
I gotta be a doctor or something.

229
00:15:01,376 --> 00:15:03,776
Gynecologist, maybe.

230
00:15:04,645 --> 00:15:05,873
- Come on.
- I'm flying.

231
00:15:06,046 --> 00:15:07,842
Yeah, you're flying.

232
00:15:08,114 --> 00:15:09,706
- Here we go.
- Ballmer.

233
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,949
You're the only guy I know
who pays the strippers...

234
00:15:14,118 --> 00:15:16,085
...to put their clothes on.

235
00:15:17,187 --> 00:15:18,449
Come on, drunkie.

236
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:27,792
Okay.

237
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:33,196
Hey, Bill...

238
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:35,696
...it's either the clothes or you,
but something...

239
00:15:35,866 --> 00:15:37,628
...definitely needs to be hosed down.

240
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,596
- Sorry we failed.
- Come on.

241
00:15:40,903 --> 00:15:43,700
- Good night.
- Sorry we failed.

242
00:15:46,006 --> 00:15:48,906
<i>Bill, Bill, Bill. </i>

243
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,238
<i>Bill, Bill, Bill. </i>

244
00:16:04,952 --> 00:16:06,543
It's an Altair.

245
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:09,653
They gave it to us as a gift.

246
00:16:10,956 --> 00:16:13,014
We blew them away.

247
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,421
Woz, do we have to have mice?

248
00:16:20,596 --> 00:16:22,688
Come on, I like mice. This is Irving.

249
00:16:22,864 --> 00:16:25,024
Hey, man, you are putting poison
into your body.

250
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:27,062
Hey, hey, come on.
Give me those.

251
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:29,758
- That's french fries, man.
- That's what I mean.

252
00:16:29,935 --> 00:16:33,165
French fries, all-American food.
Come on.

253
00:16:33,337 --> 00:16:35,271
I can't eat like you do.

254
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:37,838
Eating fruit all the time.
That's weird.

255
00:16:38,274 --> 00:16:41,935
It's not weird. It's pure.
Makes the soul pure.

256
00:16:42,109 --> 00:16:46,511
Oh, wait, wait. You gotta listen to this.
I got a great one today.

257
00:16:47,681 --> 00:16:50,876
<i>Did you hear about the drunk who
came staggering out of the subway... </i>

258
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:53,881
<i>... and said, "Man, I got lost
in some guy's basement. </i>

259
00:16:54,051 --> 00:16:57,110
<i>You should've seen the set
of trains he had"?</i>

260
00:16:59,854 --> 00:17:03,721
<i>- the Bay Area Dial-a-Joke Line,
making your day a barrel of laughs. </i>

261
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:05,483
I got a new book of Polish jokes.

262
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,683
Man, it'll keep me going for years.

263
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,850
- Why?
- Why?

264
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:12,052
It makes people laugh.

265
00:17:12,229 --> 00:17:15,891
I got people phoning in every day
just to hear my latest joke.

266
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:17,294
It makes their day better.

267
00:17:17,766 --> 00:17:19,427
Are you sure this thing's
gonna work?

268
00:17:19,602 --> 00:17:21,796
- Lf it doesn't catch fire.
- Don't even joke.

269
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,266
I like jokes.

270
00:17:25,305 --> 00:17:26,532
Jokes make me feel good.

271
00:17:35,478 --> 00:17:38,139
You know, I hired
a private detective today.

272
00:17:40,716 --> 00:17:42,740
I wanna find my mother.

273
00:17:43,184 --> 00:17:44,548
My real mother.

274
00:17:45,185 --> 00:17:46,982
You never talk about that stuff
with me.

275
00:17:47,953 --> 00:17:50,045
That part about being adopted and all.

276
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:53,587
Guy says he can probably find her.

277
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:57,424
Why do you always get freaked
out when Arlene asks about it?

278
00:17:57,593 --> 00:18:00,390
Arlene? Arlene's got her own problems.

279
00:18:00,562 --> 00:18:04,894
My parents don't want her in the house.
She phones me a million times a day.

280
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,695
At least I'm working on my stuff.

281
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:22,303
Feel better?

282
00:18:28,546 --> 00:18:31,413
Now, Steve, tell the others
what you're feeling.

283
00:18:33,017 --> 00:18:34,813
Like...

284
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:39,314
- Like it's gone.
- What is?

285
00:18:40,122 --> 00:18:41,782
The anger.

286
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:44,883
Like the anger's gone.

287
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,217
It's gone.

288
00:19:05,605 --> 00:19:08,801
<i>Back then, our big thrill was going to
this thing they called the Homebrew Club. </i>

289
00:19:08,974 --> 00:19:11,100
<i>It was where guys
spent all their spare time... </i>

290
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,471
<i>... trying to get access to computers
owned by the local corporations. </i>

291
00:19:14,644 --> 00:19:17,703
<i>And people would go there
and show the stuff they just built. </i>

292
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,370
<i>Except most of it
didn't really work all that well. </i>

293
00:19:20,548 --> 00:19:24,313
<i>- Read in the Popular Electronics
issue about a year ago...</i>

294
00:19:24,484 --> 00:19:27,247
...about the new Altair 8800.

295
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:31,081
<i>I was nervous that day we walked

- What is this thing?
- Check it out.

300
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,430
The first computer
you're ever gonna see.

301
00:19:45,597 --> 00:19:46,996
What's the screen for?

302
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,690
<i>I was never good at talking

<i>... but Steve, he was amazing. </i>

304
00:19:53,236 --> 00:19:57,228
Alexander Graham Bell when he heard his
first ring, that's as revolutionary as this is.

305
00:19:57,406 --> 00:20:01,033
He's talking about the Altair? I never
had a problem till I tried to use it.

306
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,768
<i>All of a sudden we found out what
we wanted to do with our lives. </i>

307
00:20:04,944 --> 00:20:07,343
<i>- It was all we ever wanted. 
- To 30.</i>

308
00:20:07,512 --> 00:20:10,571
Here is the first personal computer
that you're gonna wanna buy.

309
00:20:14,551 --> 00:20:17,747
Man, 50! We sold 50.

310
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,911
IBM is gonna be
loading in their pants.

311
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:23,022
I don't even think
IBM knows who we are.

312
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,555
Good. This is guerrilla warfare.

313
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,420
- They're the enemy.
- They are?

314
00:20:28,593 --> 00:20:32,824
I used to think maybe Steve was
born obsessed with wiping out IBM.

315
00:20:32,996 --> 00:20:34,462
And in a way, you could see why.

316
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:37,154
I mean, in those days,
as far as we were concerned...

317
00:20:37,332 --> 00:20:39,697
...IBM was practically
like the Pentagon.

318
00:20:41,836 --> 00:20:44,565
<i>Here were a bunch of guys
who dressed exactly the same... </i>

319
00:20:44,738 --> 00:20:46,034
<i>... and sang company songs. </i>

320
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,441
<i>I mean, we were
these scruffy crazies... </i>

321
00:20:56,612 --> 00:21:00,774
<i>... messing around with computer stuff
the IBM guys thought was, like, toys. </i>

322
00:21:00,948 --> 00:21:02,778
<i>But what did they know?</i>

323
00:21:09,386 --> 00:21:11,717
- Where's your VW?
- Sold it.

324
00:21:12,088 --> 00:21:16,183
1350 bucks. We're on our way.

325
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,086
- Steve.
- What?

326
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:21,056
- What's the problem?
- I don't know if I can build these.

327
00:21:21,228 --> 00:21:24,196
Hey, Woz, I assume we're speaking
the same language, right?

328
00:21:24,363 --> 00:21:27,422
Dan, Elizabeth,
I'm not speaking Swahili, am I?

329
00:21:27,732 --> 00:21:29,995
I'm here to inform you
our universe is unfolding...

330
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:32,192
But I still don't think
I can build them.

331
00:21:32,368 --> 00:21:34,097
I work for Hewlett-Packard sometimes.

332
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,998
- Yeah, and?
- My dad pointed it out...

333
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:38,365
...they get first chance
in anything I invent.

334
00:21:38,773 --> 00:21:40,673
- What?
- I can't help it.

335
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,740
It's on the paper I signed.

336
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:46,241
Damn it, Woz!
We get our shot, our destiny...

337
00:21:46,411 --> 00:21:49,072
...and now we gotta turn it
all over to these businessmen?

338
00:22:07,692 --> 00:22:11,353
Steve. It is Steve, isn't it?

339
00:22:12,362 --> 00:22:15,330
Yeah. Steve, you say
that this gadget of yours...

340
00:22:15,497 --> 00:22:17,862
...is for ordinary people.

341
00:22:18,533 --> 00:22:22,468
What on earth would ordinary
people want with computers?

342
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:58,048
What?

343
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:06,058
What?

344
00:23:06,598 --> 00:23:08,531
They hated it.

345
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:11,727
They hated it.

346
00:23:11,901 --> 00:23:13,561
They hated it.

347
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,583
Whenever Steve went
to a bank to get a loan...

348
00:23:48,758 --> 00:23:52,284
...it was like they were Eskimos,
and we had a refrigerator to sell them.

349
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:55,918
<i>Okay, so Steve didn't look
like a business guy. But who did?</i>

350
00:23:56,097 --> 00:23:59,623
<i>Business guys and bankers thought
you'd just barfed on their shoes... </i>

351
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,235
<i>... if you tried to interest them
in computers for ordinary people. </i>

352
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:05,369
<i>I mean, go figure. </i>

353
00:24:52,101 --> 00:24:53,329
Where's your beard?

354
00:24:54,168 --> 00:24:56,432
In the bathroom. Shaved it off.

355
00:24:56,604 --> 00:24:58,366
Well, how come?

356
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,764
Because banks don't like beards.

357
00:25:01,941 --> 00:25:03,498
So we called ourselves Apple...

358
00:25:03,675 --> 00:25:05,835
...and started making
those little computers.

359
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:08,069
Me, Steve and his friends
Elizabeth and Dan.

360
00:25:08,245 --> 00:25:11,111
All of us sweating away
in Steve's parents' garage.

361
00:25:12,047 --> 00:25:14,879
It's like sometimes not knowing
how crazy something is...

362
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:16,516
...is a good thing.

363
00:25:16,684 --> 00:25:18,310
You're just goofing around...

364
00:25:18,485 --> 00:25:21,783
...until someone like Mike
shows up and says, "Wow. "

365
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:24,649
- Steve Jobs?
- Jobs.

366
00:25:24,822 --> 00:25:27,346
Oh, right. I'm sorry. Mike Markula.

367
00:25:28,358 --> 00:25:30,518
- Hey, Mike. How you doing?
- I'm well.

368
00:25:30,693 --> 00:25:32,717
The man who put intelligence
into Intel.

369
00:25:32,894 --> 00:25:34,122
- Yeah...
- No smoking in here.

370
00:25:34,296 --> 00:25:36,559
Oh, I'm sorry about that. Yeah.

371
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,697
- Valentine said you might call.
- Yeah.

372
00:25:38,865 --> 00:25:41,765
- Welcome to Apple Computers.
- Thank you. Here it is, huh?

373
00:25:42,034 --> 00:25:44,298
I was looking for a venture
opportunity like this.

374
00:25:44,635 --> 00:25:47,103
What kind of venture money
are we talking about, Mike?

375
00:25:47,404 --> 00:25:51,203
We start with about a quarter million
dollars and see what happens.

376
00:25:52,708 --> 00:25:54,572
Excuse me?

377
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:58,441
Quarter million dollars.
You must be Steve Wozniak.

378
00:25:58,612 --> 00:26:00,169
- Yeah.
- Mike Markula.

379
00:26:00,479 --> 00:26:02,275
A quarter million dollars into this?

380
00:26:02,447 --> 00:26:04,608
- Yep.
- What's the catch?

381
00:26:05,683 --> 00:26:08,116
- No catch, just business.
- That's the catch...

382
00:26:08,284 --> 00:26:09,945
...because this ain't just business.

383
00:26:10,219 --> 00:26:13,346
This is practically spiritual.

384
00:26:13,522 --> 00:26:15,580
This is about overthrowing dead culture.

385
00:26:17,757 --> 00:26:19,986
- Dead gods.
- Okay, look.

386
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,491
You guys wanna be operating out
of a garage, that's fine with me.

387
00:26:23,661 --> 00:26:26,094
But this is a ground-zero operation here.

388
00:26:26,263 --> 00:26:28,788
Steve Wozniak's employee number one.
You're number two.

389
00:26:28,965 --> 00:26:30,626
Wait a minute.

390
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:33,824
I'm employee number one.

391
00:26:34,002 --> 00:26:36,162
- Woz?
- Doesn't matter to me.

392
00:26:36,337 --> 00:26:38,770
- I'm employee number one.
- I'm not saying anything.

393
00:26:38,938 --> 00:26:41,269
- I wasn't implying anything.
- Then I'll be zero.

394
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,203
- Woz, you can be number one.
- I'll be zero. Okay?

395
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:46,536
<i>Even though things
were changing like crazy... </i>

396
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,974
<i>... venture capitalists
and bankers and all that... </i>

397
00:26:49,145 --> 00:26:51,908
<i>... some things still stayed the same,
especially with Steve. </i>

398
00:26:52,081 --> 00:26:54,605
- I don't want it, Steve.
- It'll make you nice.

399
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:57,980
Woz, you and me.

400
00:26:58,151 --> 00:27:00,948
This is your mother telling you
to drop this beautiful acid...

401
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,916
Your mother wouldn't approve either.

402
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:05,715
- Get that away from me. "Man. "
- Man, come on.

403
00:27:06,056 --> 00:27:07,420
I'd be careful.

404
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,922
Baby, it's you and me.
Take a little trip?

405
00:27:10,093 --> 00:27:11,389
- No, thanks, Steve.
- Come on.

406
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,857
- Steve, no.
- What's the matter with you guys?

407
00:27:14,395 --> 00:27:18,592
It's like living with a bunch
of squares and stiffs.

408
00:27:19,465 --> 00:27:20,727
More for me.

409
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:27,063
Oh, I'm standing.
I'm standing in front of something.

410
00:27:27,237 --> 00:27:29,761
It's a field of wheat.

411
00:27:30,072 --> 00:27:33,302
<i>Oh, and I hear classical music playing. 
Do you hear it?</i>

412
00:27:33,475 --> 00:27:34,736
<i>Do you hear it?</i>

413
00:27:34,908 --> 00:27:38,570
<i>I'm conducting classical music!</i>

414
00:27:42,481 --> 00:27:45,415
Everything's moving with the wind.

415
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:48,676
Everything's moving with the wind.

416
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:02,157
Everything's moving
just the way I want it to.

417
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:04,294
Everything.

418
00:28:20,472 --> 00:28:21,904
Steve.

419
00:28:23,941 --> 00:28:25,407
Hey...

420
00:28:26,043 --> 00:28:28,169
...how am I gonna get home?

421
00:28:38,785 --> 00:28:41,014
- It's not bad when there's no wind.
- Yeah?

422
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:42,812
What is that?

423
00:28:46,423 --> 00:28:49,289
Bring down a pallet with six more.

424
00:28:55,262 --> 00:28:57,923
- Oh, man.
- What?

425
00:28:58,097 --> 00:29:01,554
I was just thinking about Harvard.
It'll pass.

426
00:29:02,467 --> 00:29:04,127
Hey, Paul.

427
00:29:04,802 --> 00:29:07,292
Right on schedule.
How you doing?

428
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:10,199
- Good to see you.
- Hi, Ed.

429
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,397
So...

430
00:29:14,175 --> 00:29:16,438
...are you...? Are you Bill?

431
00:29:16,609 --> 00:29:17,836
Are you Ed?

432
00:29:19,578 --> 00:29:21,738
Well, I'll be damned.

433
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:31,375
Signing bonus?

434
00:29:33,387 --> 00:29:36,753
I've never given a signing bonus
in all my life.

435
00:29:36,923 --> 00:29:40,119
You know, Ed, in our other contracts,
we always get a signing bonus.

436
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:43,317
- Other contracts?
- Yeah, our other contracts.

437
00:29:43,494 --> 00:29:45,358
Well, I don't know.

438
00:29:45,528 --> 00:29:47,461
I don't know.

439
00:29:57,403 --> 00:29:58,961
Okay.

440
00:29:59,404 --> 00:30:01,338
- Two thousand.
- Four thousand.

441
00:30:01,639 --> 00:30:03,572
- What?
- Of course.

442
00:30:03,841 --> 00:30:06,274
Next, Ed, this business
of a $ 15 royalty...

443
00:30:06,442 --> 00:30:09,968
...for BASIC sold in every 4K Altair,
it's just not acceptable.

444
00:30:10,145 --> 00:30:13,238
Let me tell you something, boy.
This ain't the way I do business.

445
00:30:13,414 --> 00:30:16,473
And I especially don't like
being dictated to by some little...

446
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:19,139
Ed, Ed, this is not about dictating.

447
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,877
You see, this is about reality.

448
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:27,148
The reality is that your machine is
brilliant, but it needs our language.

449
00:30:27,323 --> 00:30:30,348
And without it, you know,
it's just a tin box that lights up.

450
00:30:34,061 --> 00:30:37,859
So let's double our royalty
from $ 15 to $30 a copy.

451
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,359
<i>So back then I get postcards
from these guys. </i>

452
00:30:46,536 --> 00:30:49,765
<i>"Wish you were here," and all that. 
Yeah, right, Albuquerque. </i>

453
00:30:49,937 --> 00:30:52,167
<i>Bill and Paul were living
in this crummy motel... </i>

454
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,967
<i>... acting like they had a clue about
being in the computer business. </i>

455
00:30:56,142 --> 00:30:57,905
- Eureka.
- What?

456
00:30:58,077 --> 00:31:01,170
I created a program
that can play blackjack.

457
00:31:01,578 --> 00:31:04,342
Chris, you've been here two days,
and you're into blackjack?

458
00:31:04,515 --> 00:31:06,209
Yeah, so?

459
00:31:06,382 --> 00:31:08,212
So you got work to do.

460
00:31:12,987 --> 00:31:14,647
Oh, God, no.

461
00:31:14,821 --> 00:31:17,311
Not Frank Sinatra. Not "My Way. "

462
00:31:17,489 --> 00:31:19,422
Not again. Spare us.

463
00:31:30,832 --> 00:31:33,629
So, Paul, I'm putting in $909,
and you're in for 606...

464
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,630
...and we're keeping
the Microsoft name.

465
00:31:35,902 --> 00:31:39,234
You know how you told Ed that
we're leasing whole office buildings?

466
00:31:39,404 --> 00:31:41,667
What if he finds out
our corporate headquarters...

467
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:44,602
...are in that roach motel
with two student employees?

468
00:31:48,443 --> 00:31:49,841
You think they're hookers?

469
00:31:50,111 --> 00:31:52,442
Either that or motel inspectors.

470
00:31:52,612 --> 00:31:55,045
I saw that one going in and out
of the motel room...

471
00:31:55,214 --> 00:31:57,444
...about a dozen times yesterday.

472
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:04,145
Oh, baby.

473
00:32:10,758 --> 00:32:13,885
- I quit Harvard for this?
- You wanted glamour.

474
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,856
- You got glamour.
- Come on, baby.

475
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:20,360
Quit bitching
or else go get us that pizza.

476
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,631
Oh, yeah.

477
00:32:28,002 --> 00:32:30,436
Oh, baby, come on. Yes!

478
00:33:13,132 --> 00:33:17,625
Rise and shine. Wakey wakey.
Your 9:30's here.

479
00:33:17,803 --> 00:33:20,498
You left your MasterCard
in the restaurant again yesterday.

480
00:33:20,671 --> 00:33:24,036
That's the third time this month.
The hotel in Dallas called and said...

481
00:33:24,206 --> 00:33:26,800
...you left your suit in the room
when you checked out.

482
00:33:26,975 --> 00:33:31,001
Hertz called back and said
they will never rent you a car again.

483
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:34,146
Two more speeding citations in the mail
and wash your hair.

484
00:33:34,313 --> 00:33:37,839
No, comb your hair, wash it later
and change your shirt.

485
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:42,514
It's over there.

486
00:33:48,723 --> 00:33:52,818
We're here for our 9:30
with your president, Mr. Gates.

487
00:33:59,963 --> 00:34:01,555
Mr...

488
00:34:01,732 --> 00:34:03,028
...Gates?

489
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:10,798
Hello?

490
00:34:10,971 --> 00:34:15,303
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
Paul left a message. He said to tell you...

491
00:34:15,474 --> 00:34:18,965
...if you get thrown in jail again tonight,
you're on your own.

492
00:34:19,143 --> 00:34:22,475
You have to find somebody else
to bail you out.

493
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:24,442
Okay?

494
00:34:27,749 --> 00:34:32,207
- Jeez, Bill, isn't this Paul's car?
- You know, I figured it out.

495
00:34:33,319 --> 00:34:35,411
Exercise is bad for your health.

496
00:34:35,587 --> 00:34:39,579
You see, if you take a normal pulse rate,
70 per minute...

497
00:34:39,757 --> 00:34:43,248
...times the average life span,
which is 75 years...

498
00:34:43,426 --> 00:34:45,552
- Too fast, Bill. Please.
- Let's see, that's...

499
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:50,824
...70 times 60 minutes,
times 24 hours, times 365 days.

500
00:34:50,997 --> 00:34:53,294
- Come on, please.
- That's 37 million heartbeats...

501
00:34:53,465 --> 00:34:54,864
...times 75 years.

502
00:34:55,034 --> 00:34:56,261
Slow down.

503
00:35:04,507 --> 00:35:06,770
Hey, Chris. Take a look.

504
00:35:09,977 --> 00:35:11,910
Bill.

505
00:35:13,012 --> 00:35:14,501
No way, man.

506
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:17,513
Bill.

507
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:20,381
The keys are in it.

508
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,710
I don't know if this
is such a good idea, Bill.

509
00:35:22,885 --> 00:35:26,115
Can you get off that thing? Come on.

510
00:35:27,255 --> 00:35:29,882
I think you steer with the pedals
and these levers.

511
00:35:30,057 --> 00:35:32,854
No, Bill. Come on. Please.

512
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,258
- Okay, don't worry about it.
- Yeah, right.

513
00:35:35,427 --> 00:35:37,088
On your mark.

514
00:35:37,394 --> 00:35:39,385
Get set.

515
00:35:39,563 --> 00:35:41,427
Go.

516
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,828
You're going down.

517
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:00,073
No way, man.

518
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:04,640
<i>Microsoft?
Nobody I knew ever heard of Microsoft... </i>

519
00:36:04,813 --> 00:36:07,144
<i>... or Bill Gates. 
I mean, they were nobodies. </i>

520
00:36:07,314 --> 00:36:10,908
But then we were all nobodies,
which was perfect for us...

521
00:36:11,084 --> 00:36:13,881
...because all the respectable,
straight-arrow guys...

522
00:36:14,052 --> 00:36:17,077
...were busy doing what they always do,
which is be respectable...

523
00:36:17,254 --> 00:36:20,450
<i>... which meant the rest of us
could run around acting like crazies... </i>

524
00:36:20,623 --> 00:36:22,954
<i>... which is what we did best. </i>

525
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:24,887
<i>I miss those days. </i>

526
00:36:29,763 --> 00:36:32,162
A bulldozer?

527
00:36:32,331 --> 00:36:34,992
Who's this Apple Computer?

528
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:37,395
You hit my car with a bulldozer, Bill?

529
00:36:37,935 --> 00:36:39,163
I'm sorry.

530
00:36:39,336 --> 00:36:42,395
<i>We went looking for someone who had
the kind of software we needed. </i>

531
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:46,563
<i>The only place we found was this dinky
little company in Albuquerque, New Mexico. </i>

532
00:36:46,741 --> 00:36:50,904
It says Apple wants a contract
for $21,000 to license BASIC.

533
00:36:51,077 --> 00:36:53,237
Do you know what this means, Paul?

534
00:36:53,412 --> 00:36:56,744
Yeah, yeah. It means
that we're desperate for business.

535
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:59,677
We're nearly bankrupt, and even worse,
we're in Albuquerque.

536
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,511
I just got this car, Bill.
I don't believe you.

537
00:37:02,685 --> 00:37:05,016
- A damn bulldozer?
- I'm sorry.

538
00:37:05,186 --> 00:37:08,985
I think that this means there's something
really going on out there in California.

539
00:37:19,295 --> 00:37:23,355
- Nine forty-five.
- A.M. Or P.M.?

540
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,999
Opens in 15 minutes.

541
00:37:28,168 --> 00:37:31,068
I'm so tired I can't see straight.

542
00:37:31,504 --> 00:37:34,563
What if they find out we've only made
three of these computers...

543
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:37,866
...and we're acting like we got
an assembly line full of the things?

544
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:41,100
- What then?
- Hey, Woz. No sleeping in the booth, Woz.

545
00:37:41,277 --> 00:37:42,709
You're cluttering up the joint.

546
00:37:42,878 --> 00:37:45,778
Steve, all of a sudden
we're working harder than our fathers...

547
00:37:45,946 --> 00:37:48,038
...who we laughed at
for how hard they worked.

548
00:37:48,214 --> 00:37:51,307
- I don't get it.
- Come on. Still gotta change.

549
00:37:51,483 --> 00:37:52,711
Change what?

550
00:37:52,885 --> 00:37:54,977
<i>Doors will open in 15 minutes. </i>

551
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,047
Oh, my God.

552
00:38:02,425 --> 00:38:04,984
- Steve.
- What?

553
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,492
- What?
- No.

554
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:15,565
- Like I have to have a mustache?
- A suit. You actually bought a suit.

555
00:38:16,133 --> 00:38:18,396
Two minutes to 10.

556
00:38:19,669 --> 00:38:24,001
- Well, you think anyone will show up?
- How the hell should I know that?

557
00:38:24,505 --> 00:38:28,463
Of course they're gonna show up.
I don't know. Maybe.

558
00:38:28,642 --> 00:38:30,302
Is my tie okay?

559
00:38:40,817 --> 00:38:42,681
There it is.

560
00:38:45,486 --> 00:38:50,148
<i>Unbelievable. It was practically like
being a rock star or something. </i>

561
00:38:50,322 --> 00:38:51,653
<i>People swarming all over you. </i>

562
00:38:51,824 --> 00:38:54,223
<i>Hordes of them coming to see
this amazing machine... </i>

563
00:38:54,392 --> 00:38:57,918
<i>... with 62 chips
and ICs that make all these colors. </i>

564
00:39:00,529 --> 00:39:04,396
Hard plastic, molded casing.
You've never seen this.

565
00:39:19,242 --> 00:39:23,574
- 65.02 and up.
- No, we got them beat.

566
00:39:23,911 --> 00:39:25,935
<i>And when the guys
from Microsoft showed up... </i>

567
00:39:26,112 --> 00:39:29,080
<i>... how were we to know who they were?
Them standing there... </i>

568
00:39:29,248 --> 00:39:32,683
<i>... looking at an empty Altair booth
on one side and us on the other. </i>

569
00:39:32,851 --> 00:39:35,341
<i>- I mean, who would you choose?
- Hi, how are you?</i>

570
00:39:38,855 --> 00:39:40,083
- Hi.
- Steve.

571
00:39:40,256 --> 00:39:41,779
- How you doing?
- I'm Bill Gates.

572
00:39:41,957 --> 00:39:43,548
- Yeah, hi.
- Chairman of Microsoft.

573
00:39:43,724 --> 00:39:46,453
- Nice to see you. We had a box...
- Microsoft, we design...

574
00:39:46,626 --> 00:39:48,924
Yeah, good to see you.

575
00:39:50,996 --> 00:39:53,691
- Hey, Steve. Over here.
- Hi, John.

576
00:40:00,569 --> 00:40:01,796
Excuse me, excuse me.

577
00:40:03,004 --> 00:40:05,301
No, wait, come here. Come here.

578
00:40:05,806 --> 00:40:08,399
Maybe he just didn't hear you
or something.

579
00:40:08,574 --> 00:40:09,802
Yeah, maybe.

580
00:40:09,976 --> 00:40:14,536
For the first time in my life, people are
coming to me, instead of me going to them.

581
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:17,373
Man, this is insanely great.

582
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:37,422
<i>I'm telling you, it was a weird time. </i>

583
00:40:37,593 --> 00:40:41,050
<i>People were going nuts over the Apple II.
I couldn't keep up with anything. </i>

584
00:40:41,229 --> 00:40:45,426
<i>The company was expanding so fast I
didn't know who half the new people were. </i>

585
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:02,169
<i>And Steve had a lot of people,
you know, older people... </i>

586
00:41:02,343 --> 00:41:05,675
<i>... start pay attention to him,
which was amazing. </i>

587
00:41:05,846 --> 00:41:09,076
<i>And me too, sort of. 
People even knew who I was. </i>

588
00:41:09,248 --> 00:41:10,680
<i>- Hi.
- Should have been fun... </i>

589
00:41:10,849 --> 00:41:14,181
<i>... but with all the good stuff,
bad stuff came too. </i>

590
00:41:18,921 --> 00:41:20,149
- Steve.
- What?

591
00:41:20,322 --> 00:41:22,414
Oh, jeez. Not again.

592
00:41:24,558 --> 00:41:27,287
What? What? What?

593
00:41:27,459 --> 00:41:30,393
What are you...? What are you talking about,
it's not your child?

594
00:41:30,562 --> 00:41:32,462
How do I even know if this baby's mine?

595
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,961
- You know. Damn you, you know.
- How do I know that?

596
00:41:35,132 --> 00:41:37,964
Steve, I'm two months pregnant.
Who else have I been with?

597
00:41:38,134 --> 00:41:41,261
Look, go do whatever it is you wanna do.
You wanna play mommy? Fine.

598
00:41:41,436 --> 00:41:44,700
- But the kid's not mine.
- It is. It is.

599
00:41:44,872 --> 00:41:46,736
You bastard!

600
00:41:47,206 --> 00:41:48,900
God.

601
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:52,705
What did they say?

602
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:55,572
Hey, Steve. Take a look at this.

603
00:41:55,745 --> 00:41:57,609
Carl's got that parity on that BASIC...

604
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:01,840
You guys are not being paid
to be a bunch of clowns!

605
00:42:02,016 --> 00:42:05,178
Or maybe you are.
Maybe that's the problem around here.

606
00:42:05,352 --> 00:42:07,979
You guys are supposed
to be writing programs.

607
00:42:08,154 --> 00:42:09,950
Steve, we were just doing...

608
00:42:10,121 --> 00:42:15,056
I need people with talent.
I need artists!

609
00:42:15,792 --> 00:42:21,888
What the hell are you morons but a bunch
of clock-punching losers? Huh, tell me?

610
00:42:25,498 --> 00:42:29,796
And here is another letter
of recommendation.

611
00:42:30,435 --> 00:42:34,370
Well, Mr. Brewster,
we've looked at your application...

612
00:42:34,538 --> 00:42:36,698
...and I see a lot
of mainframe experience here.

613
00:42:36,872 --> 00:42:39,840
Six years. Actually...

614
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:45,008
Six and a half.

615
00:42:46,546 --> 00:42:50,605
Steve? I don't know
if you've met Steve Jobs.

616
00:42:50,781 --> 00:42:54,375
Yes. No. It's good to meet you.

617
00:42:54,551 --> 00:42:56,575
Right.

618
00:42:57,152 --> 00:42:59,278
You were in marketing, correct?

619
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:01,922
That was before the programming. Yeah.

620
00:43:02,089 --> 00:43:05,023
I took night-school courses
at San Jos State.

621
00:43:05,191 --> 00:43:07,182
You look like an IBM type.

622
00:43:08,026 --> 00:43:09,288
Well...

623
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:14,726
...no. But I did have a chance in college
to be interviewed by them...

624
00:43:15,798 --> 00:43:19,062
...and they liked me. They flew me out
to their headquarters Back East.

625
00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:25,563
Oh, I'm sure they did.

626
00:43:25,738 --> 00:43:27,933
No, I did, see?

627
00:43:28,107 --> 00:43:32,439
I was one of about a dozen people
that they really recruited.

628
00:43:32,609 --> 00:43:34,440
Are you a virgin?

629
00:43:36,912 --> 00:43:38,173
Steve, come on.

630
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:43,206
- What? Am I what?
- Are you a virgin?

631
00:43:43,384 --> 00:43:45,374
L...

632
00:43:45,685 --> 00:43:46,912
No.

633
00:43:50,154 --> 00:43:52,019
How old were you
when you first got laid?

634
00:43:52,189 --> 00:43:54,122
I don't... I don't...

635
00:43:54,758 --> 00:43:58,022
- Steve, will you leave him alone?
- I asked you a question.

636
00:44:01,795 --> 00:44:07,356
My wife and I have been married
since we were in grad school.

637
00:44:07,532 --> 00:44:10,762
I didn't ask you about your wife.

638
00:44:12,136 --> 00:44:16,468
You're still a virgin.
You just think you're not.

639
00:44:22,175 --> 00:44:24,166
You don't fit in here.

640
00:44:29,047 --> 00:44:31,571
Why are you even wasting our time?

641
00:44:47,793 --> 00:44:49,783
I...

642
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:57,196
Yeah, I'll run a test on it.

643
00:45:02,736 --> 00:45:03,997
Steve...

644
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:09,902
...you demolished that guy.
- Woz, what we're doing right now...

645
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:12,941
...is like...

646
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:16,368
...opening doors.

647
00:45:16,545 --> 00:45:18,240
Every day.

648
00:45:18,813 --> 00:45:23,545
If you open the wrong one,
all sorts of bad things will come at you.

649
00:45:24,583 --> 00:45:27,346
You gotta be careful
which door you open.

650
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:37,624
- You want me to go apologize to that guy?
- Well, he probably left.

651
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:41,992
You know, Steve, there's things
you probably have to get past with me.

652
00:45:42,662 --> 00:45:45,858
But I'm telling you, there's things
that I have to get past with you.

653
00:45:46,031 --> 00:45:48,157
I mean, people say stuff
about you sometimes...

654
00:45:48,332 --> 00:45:50,926
...and I don't listen to them,
because I know you.

655
00:45:51,101 --> 00:45:54,934
I mean, I excuse stuff
because we're friends.

656
00:45:58,372 --> 00:46:00,362
It's worth it. It is.

657
00:46:01,074 --> 00:46:03,234
It's worth it. It's worth it. It's worth it.

658
00:46:06,377 --> 00:46:08,777
<i>It was about five years
after I got out of Harvard... </i>

659
00:46:10,447 --> 00:46:14,507
<i>... I get this call from Bill, who says,
"You wanna join me and Paul?"</i>

660
00:46:14,684 --> 00:46:17,516
<i>It was a two-bit little company
they called Microsoft. </i>

661
00:46:17,685 --> 00:46:21,814
<i>And at first I think,
"Yeah. Like I'd like to lose more hair. "</i>

662
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:24,285
<i>But, you know, then I started thinking. </i>

663
00:46:24,456 --> 00:46:26,151
You know how you survive?

664
00:46:26,657 --> 00:46:28,818
You make people need you.

665
00:46:29,127 --> 00:46:33,391
You survive because
you make them need what you have.

666
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:36,893
And then they have nowhere else to go.

667
00:46:40,501 --> 00:46:42,468
Right now we're dead.

668
00:46:43,402 --> 00:46:48,201
- Nobody needs us.
- So we make them need us?

669
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:51,673
We're too small even to matter.

670
00:46:51,841 --> 00:46:56,174
We could be snuffed out tomorrow,
and no one would notice.

671
00:46:56,344 --> 00:46:58,209
You know what they say in the Mafia?

672
00:46:59,646 --> 00:47:04,412
You keep your friends close
but your enemies closer.

673
00:47:04,583 --> 00:47:07,278
Which enemies are you talking about?

674
00:47:13,256 --> 00:47:15,985
I got some full barf bags here.
Full barf bags. Heads up.

675
00:47:16,158 --> 00:47:17,818
- He's sick.
- Bald guy with barf bags.

676
00:47:17,992 --> 00:47:21,188
Coming through. Full ones too.
How you doing?

677
00:47:27,098 --> 00:47:28,725
Come on.

678
00:47:42,008 --> 00:47:46,535
- My tie. I forgot my tie.
- Great, Bill. We're already late.

679
00:47:52,448 --> 00:47:56,177
Hey, how you doing?
Ten bucks for your tie. Okay, 20.

680
00:47:56,818 --> 00:48:00,719
Thirty. Come on, come on.
Thirty. Thirty bucks for that tie.

681
00:48:00,887 --> 00:48:04,878
Where did you get that, Sears? Come on.
Help us out here. Would you? Please?

682
00:48:08,325 --> 00:48:10,815
<i>You see, by that time,
Bill had already figured out... </i>

683
00:48:10,993 --> 00:48:15,554
<i>... that we gotta go right into the belly of the
beast. The scariest beast of them all, IBM.</i>

684
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:21,064
<i>IBM. And back then, man, they were like
Attila the Hun, Genghis Khan... </i>

685
00:48:21,234 --> 00:48:24,862
<i>... and Vlad the Impaler all rolled into one. </i>

686
00:48:25,037 --> 00:48:29,199
<i>But what we were gonna do was,
we were gonna make them love us. </i>

687
00:48:29,372 --> 00:48:31,703
Gentlemen, how are you? Nice tie.

688
00:48:31,874 --> 00:48:33,865
- Thanks.
- We're over here.

689
00:48:34,742 --> 00:48:37,471
Our shirts are as white as theirs.

690
00:48:39,713 --> 00:48:42,146
We think we have what you need.

691
00:48:42,715 --> 00:48:44,147
That's a start.

692
00:48:44,316 --> 00:48:49,411
Now, we know that IBM has set up
this place to compete head-on with Apple...

693
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:54,817
...and you're gearing up to come out with a
personal computer that will wipe them out.

694
00:48:54,989 --> 00:48:57,048
So we can get you an operating system.

695
00:48:57,791 --> 00:49:00,351
What kind of operating system?

696
00:49:00,527 --> 00:49:02,289
It's called...

697
00:49:02,461 --> 00:49:04,257
...DOS.

698
00:49:05,129 --> 00:49:09,826
This is amazing.
Not just amazing, it's historic.

699
00:49:09,999 --> 00:49:12,331
It should be taught
in all the history books.

700
00:49:12,501 --> 00:49:15,764
I mean, hung and framed
in the National Gallery or something.

701
00:49:15,936 --> 00:49:18,597
Because this is the instant of creation...

702
00:49:18,771 --> 00:49:22,035
...of one of the greatest fortunes
in the history of the world.

703
00:49:22,207 --> 00:49:27,837
I mean, Bill Gates is the richest guy in the
world because of what started in this room.

704
00:49:28,011 --> 00:49:29,444
You wanna know what else?

705
00:49:29,613 --> 00:49:33,604
It wasn't exactly smoke and mirrors,
but we didn't have anything.

706
00:49:33,781 --> 00:49:37,511
I mean, not a damn thing.

707
00:49:38,018 --> 00:49:40,178
Here we were, this two-bit little outfit...

708
00:49:40,353 --> 00:49:44,311
...telling IBM we had the answer
to their problems.

709
00:49:44,489 --> 00:49:47,252
DOS? The Disk Operating System?

710
00:49:47,424 --> 00:49:51,153
To make all those zillion
IBM computers compute?

711
00:49:51,326 --> 00:49:55,421
We didn't even remotely own
anything like what Bill was selling them.

712
00:49:55,596 --> 00:49:57,927
<i>Nada, zip.</i>

713
00:50:02,968 --> 00:50:05,834
Of course, we don't just
wanna sell it to you outright.

714
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,994
We wanna be able to license it to you.

715
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:11,503
- You want to retain ownership?
- Right.

716
00:50:12,741 --> 00:50:18,336
Well, the profits are in the computers
themselves, not this software stuff.

717
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,372
No big deal.

718
00:50:24,048 --> 00:50:25,276
Oh, and one other thing.

719
00:50:25,449 --> 00:50:27,609
We have to be able...

720
00:50:27,784 --> 00:50:30,274
...to sell it to other outfits.

721
00:50:32,521 --> 00:50:33,851
But...

722
00:50:34,022 --> 00:50:38,855
...there was just one little problem.

723
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:43,650
Bill, why did you tell them
we have an operating system?

724
00:50:43,828 --> 00:50:46,455
We don't have a thing to sell them now.
We're dead.

725
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:50,724
- We're not. You'll give us the miracle, right?
- Oh, yeah, right.

726
00:50:50,899 --> 00:50:54,527
Well, come on. You said you knew a guy
we could buy an operating system from.

727
00:50:54,702 --> 00:50:56,692
I said I sort of know him.

728
00:50:56,870 --> 00:51:00,032
Sort of? You heard me.
Don't tell me "sort of. " I just told IBM.

729
00:51:01,573 --> 00:51:03,472
Sort of.

730
00:51:09,378 --> 00:51:12,039
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

731
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:30,981
So basically, you're saying
you wanna buy my operating system.

732
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,387
Yeah.

733
00:51:37,364 --> 00:51:38,591
Why?

734
00:51:42,734 --> 00:51:48,671
You know, I don't know. We just think we
might be able to mess with it and resell it.

735
00:51:48,838 --> 00:51:50,065
Who to?

736
00:51:50,238 --> 00:51:53,001
We have a few customers, you know,
we're sort of talking to.

737
00:51:53,174 --> 00:51:55,698
Some of them don't want it known
what we're doing.

738
00:51:55,875 --> 00:51:59,275
So they made us sign
a secrecy agreement.

739
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,277
- And you're offering us...?
- Fifty thousand.

740
00:52:05,449 --> 00:52:08,212
- Dollars?
- Dollars.

741
00:52:15,456 --> 00:52:16,683
You worried?

742
00:52:16,856 --> 00:52:19,915
Oh, no. Only my whole life hangs
in the balance. Me, worried? No.

743
00:52:21,326 --> 00:52:23,190
We got IBM.

744
00:52:23,361 --> 00:52:25,851
IBM. I mean, come to think of it...

745
00:52:26,029 --> 00:52:29,520
...why would IBM wanna make a deal
with a bunch of bozos like us?

746
00:52:29,698 --> 00:52:31,688
Because they're successful, Ballmer.

747
00:52:31,866 --> 00:52:35,460
Success is a menace. It fools smart people
into thinking they can't lose.

748
00:52:47,243 --> 00:52:48,642
So?

749
00:52:51,947 --> 00:52:54,073
So, you mute moron?

750
00:53:06,256 --> 00:53:09,122
<i>Can you hear it? The sound of money?</i>

751
00:53:10,692 --> 00:53:14,149
<i>The roar of money. It was like everywhere
you turned, money poured down. </i>

752
00:53:14,328 --> 00:53:16,261
<i>Millions and more millions. </i>

753
00:53:16,429 --> 00:53:20,888
<i>All because we bought that guy's
operating system for a measly 50,000 bucks. </i>

754
00:53:21,066 --> 00:53:26,559
<i>That fueled a worldwide explosion of wealth
unlike anything in the history of man. </i>

755
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:28,999
<i>But you know something?</i>

756
00:53:29,171 --> 00:53:34,266
<i>Having money and being cool
are not necessarily the same thing. </i>

757
00:53:34,441 --> 00:53:36,738
- Hi, I'm Bill Gates...
- Hey.

758
00:53:37,676 --> 00:53:39,575
What in the...?

759
00:53:41,179 --> 00:53:42,475
Hi.

760
00:53:43,047 --> 00:53:45,480
You know, you should really watch
where you're going.

761
00:53:46,049 --> 00:53:48,017
You must have really great bandwidth.

762
00:53:48,184 --> 00:53:51,118
- Excuse me?
- What are you doing later?

763
00:53:56,923 --> 00:53:58,913
Who is that jerk?

764
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,088
Way to go, hotshot.

765
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:10,692
When Paul and I were at Lakeside,
we were in 10th grade together...

766
00:54:10,865 --> 00:54:14,197
...we rigged a computer so we could
get classes with all the best girls.

767
00:54:14,368 --> 00:54:16,301
Obviously, it's been downhill since then.

768
00:54:16,469 --> 00:54:20,097
You should walk around with your bankbook
hanging from a chain on your belt.

769
00:54:20,272 --> 00:54:23,798
Or maybe you ought to stop yelling
in front of your employees.

770
00:54:23,973 --> 00:54:26,998
Girls don't like yelling. They like cool.

771
00:54:27,176 --> 00:54:29,804
Oh, really, Ballmer?
How do you get to be cool?

772
00:54:30,511 --> 00:54:33,479
<i>I don't know. You saw
Saturday Night Fever. Travolta's cool.</i>

773
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:07,830
I'd like to welcome all of you to the new
headquarters and home of Apple Computers.

774
00:55:08,003 --> 00:55:10,197
<i>All of a sudden, Steve was a huge star. </i>

775
00:55:10,371 --> 00:55:13,134
<i>The kind where people practically
hang on your every word... </i>

776
00:55:13,307 --> 00:55:15,706
<i>... like they're excited
just to be around you. </i>

777
00:55:15,875 --> 00:55:19,810
Thank you very much
for joining us today on this lovely day...

778
00:55:19,978 --> 00:55:22,605
...and helping us stop the gossip rumors
in their tracks.

779
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:24,644
Without further ado,
the rumors are true.

780
00:55:24,814 --> 00:55:27,304
Ladies and gentlemen,
our new president, John Sculley.

781
00:55:33,353 --> 00:55:37,254
To tell you the truth, I was perfectly happy
to be president of Pepsi-Cola...

782
00:55:37,423 --> 00:55:40,914
...until Steve Jobs came to recruit me
and said:

783
00:55:41,091 --> 00:55:43,889
"Do you wanna sell sugared water
for the rest of your life...

784
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,652
...or do you wanna make history?"

785
00:55:47,162 --> 00:55:48,823
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

786
00:55:48,997 --> 00:55:51,021
- I know.
- Yeah, operator.

787
00:55:51,198 --> 00:55:54,223
- I need information for Oregon.
- Okay, give me a minute.

788
00:55:58,903 --> 00:56:02,099
Steve, I gotta talk. I don't know how
to act in situations like this.

789
00:56:02,272 --> 00:56:04,967
- In a minute.
- I mean, Steve, that stock-offering thing?

790
00:56:05,141 --> 00:56:06,369
A hundred million dollars?

791
00:56:06,542 --> 00:56:08,702
- What do you do with $ 116 million?
- In a minute.

792
00:56:08,877 --> 00:56:12,835
I don't think rich, okay? I know a lot of
people think rich, but I don't think rich.

793
00:56:13,013 --> 00:56:17,038
I mean, maybe you learn it, but, jeez,
$ 100 million. That's a lot of learning to do.

794
00:56:17,215 --> 00:56:20,206
I hardly ever had enough for lunch
before all this.

795
00:56:20,985 --> 00:56:23,384
We should have given stock
to the other guys, Steve.

796
00:56:23,553 --> 00:56:26,214
Like Dan?
Dan's been with us since we started...

797
00:56:26,388 --> 00:56:29,083
...and you didn't set aside
any stock for him.

798
00:56:31,225 --> 00:56:32,885
Steve.

799
00:56:33,693 --> 00:56:36,490
- I'm gonna give Dan some of my stock.
- Yeah, is Arlene there?

800
00:56:36,662 --> 00:56:38,356
We gotta do the right thing.

801
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:41,193
<i>Arlene? Okay, fine. 
Let's talk about this baby. </i>

802
00:56:41,365 --> 00:56:44,595
Steve, why do you care
what I call the baby?

803
00:56:44,767 --> 00:56:47,826
Because I don't want
the baby named Rainbow.

804
00:56:48,003 --> 00:56:52,029
Or Orisha or Ravi Shankar
or any other name like that.

805
00:56:52,705 --> 00:56:55,138
Steve, not right now, okay?

806
00:56:55,307 --> 00:56:58,969
<i>Well, when the hell is a good time to call?
Because every time I try...</i>

807
00:57:01,811 --> 00:57:03,608
Steve.

808
00:57:52,078 --> 00:57:54,012
- Do you want me to take that?
- Thank you.

809
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:55,874
You're welcome.

810
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:21,596
Hi.

811
00:58:22,198 --> 00:58:23,688
Hi.

812
00:58:26,535 --> 00:58:29,503
So I just came by to make sure
everything's okay.

813
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:33,531
- Everything okay?
- Thank you.

814
00:58:45,447 --> 00:58:47,540
And to...

815
00:58:47,716 --> 00:58:50,979
...make sure that you're not
gonna name it some weird name.

816
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:57,679
What's wrong with naming her Orisha?

817
00:58:58,623 --> 00:59:00,681
Or Sunshine or Purity?

818
00:59:02,325 --> 00:59:04,815
A kid's got enough problems
in this world...

819
00:59:04,994 --> 00:59:07,018
...not knowing where it belongs.

820
00:59:07,195 --> 00:59:08,718
A name can label a kid.

821
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,354
Make it...

822
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:13,896
It can make it an outsider.

823
00:59:14,633 --> 00:59:16,157
Not "it. "

824
00:59:16,334 --> 00:59:17,561
Her.

825
00:59:18,802 --> 00:59:20,360
Her.

826
00:59:31,845 --> 00:59:33,402
Lisa.

827
00:59:37,315 --> 00:59:38,975
Okay.

828
00:59:39,449 --> 00:59:40,939
Okay.

829
00:59:43,886 --> 00:59:45,819
She's your daughter too.

830
00:59:47,855 --> 00:59:51,085
Arlene, let's not go through that again.

831
01:00:04,266 --> 01:00:07,257
You don't just live in life.

832
01:00:07,435 --> 01:00:12,097
You change it, you shape it,
you make your mark upon it.

833
01:00:12,772 --> 01:00:15,365
And that's what, get used to the name...

834
01:00:16,074 --> 01:00:18,940
...Lisa is gonna do.

835
01:00:19,109 --> 01:00:20,336
Yeah!

836
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:23,910
<i>You know, that computer was
the first big new project we had at Apple. </i>

837
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:28,276
<i>And some people are still wondering
why Steve insisted on that name. </i>

838
01:00:29,316 --> 01:00:31,284
You wanna call a computer Lisa?

839
01:00:32,484 --> 01:00:34,475
Isn't that your baby's...?

840
01:00:34,652 --> 01:00:36,381
I mean...

841
01:00:36,554 --> 01:00:41,285
What's her name? Arlene.
Isn't that Arlene's baby's name?

842
01:00:41,457 --> 01:00:44,186
Other guys here
have daughters named Lisa.

843
01:00:44,359 --> 01:00:48,727
Steve, you got a baby up there
you don't even wanna talk about.

844
01:00:49,595 --> 01:00:53,724
- I mean, it looks sort of...
- Sort of what?

845
01:01:03,005 --> 01:01:06,872
We have to think of ourselves as artists.

846
01:01:08,175 --> 01:01:10,438
It's like Picasso said:

847
01:01:10,609 --> 01:01:14,305
Good artists copy. Great artists steal.

848
01:01:16,447 --> 01:01:19,279
<i>This is who we wanted
to steal from. Xerox. </i>

849
01:01:19,449 --> 01:01:21,973
<i>They were secretly developing
all this amazing stuff... </i>

850
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:26,017
<i>... like the mouse and the graphics on the
screen instead of just a bunch of numbers. </i>

851
01:01:26,187 --> 01:01:29,019
<i>But when those California engineers
had to go to New York... </i>

852
01:01:29,189 --> 01:01:31,782
<i>... and present all this neat stuff
to the Xerox brass... </i>

853
01:01:31,957 --> 01:01:35,448
<i>... those executives didn't begin
to understand what they were looking at. </i>

854
01:01:35,626 --> 01:01:41,221
<i>Never mind a mouse. It was like someone
dumped a dead rat on the boardroom table. </i>

855
01:01:48,868 --> 01:01:50,665
A mouse.

856
01:01:54,939 --> 01:01:58,999
You want Xerox to consider
something called a mouse?

857
01:02:05,146 --> 01:02:07,477
<i>See, this is where Steve was a genius... </i>

858
01:02:07,647 --> 01:02:11,241
<i>... because he persuaded Xerox
into showing us all this incredible stuff... </i>

859
01:02:11,417 --> 01:02:13,213
<i>... their California guys had developed. </i>

860
01:02:13,385 --> 01:02:16,012
<i>I tell you, it was making their people
absolutely nuts. </i>

861
01:02:17,421 --> 01:02:19,149
Oh, God.

862
01:02:22,758 --> 01:02:24,691
Let's go.

863
01:02:25,826 --> 01:02:28,419
<i>You know, I felt like
one of the Mongol hordes... </i>

864
01:02:28,595 --> 01:02:32,325
<i>... coming to loot and plunder
a bunch of defenseless villagers. </i>

865
01:02:34,332 --> 01:02:37,095
No, no. This is insane.

866
01:02:37,267 --> 01:02:39,393
We'd just be handing him everything.

867
01:02:39,568 --> 01:02:44,732
We created the mouse and all the rest of it,
and now these idiots in New York...

868
01:02:44,906 --> 01:02:46,930
...want to show it all to Steve Jobs.

869
01:02:47,107 --> 01:02:48,471
I won't do it.

870
01:02:48,641 --> 01:02:51,632
Hi. I'm Steve Jobs.

871
01:02:54,378 --> 01:02:57,778
I need you to answer some other questions
about the stuff you've invented.

872
01:02:57,947 --> 01:02:59,937
The graphic interface?

873
01:03:02,418 --> 01:03:04,214
It's not going to hurt.

874
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:06,151
That's what you think.

875
01:03:08,221 --> 01:03:10,711
- What do you want to know?
- How does it...?

876
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:13,585
What is your base length?
Is it integer, or is it compound?

877
01:03:13,758 --> 01:03:16,282
Does your operating system
convert to executable codes?

878
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:19,895
- I got it. I got it, Steve-O. I got it, Steve-O.
- What is the middle...?

879
01:03:25,065 --> 01:03:27,658
It's pretty neat, right?

880
01:03:27,834 --> 01:03:30,427
Click, you're there.

881
01:03:30,769 --> 01:03:32,827
Click, you're somewhere else.

882
01:03:33,004 --> 01:03:37,064
This graphic interface stuff was like
a miracle back then, and we got it.

883
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:41,402
Steve got it, from Xerox, who just
turned it all over for us to fool with.

884
01:03:41,576 --> 01:03:45,033
Like rich people giving junky old stuff
to the Salvation Army...

885
01:03:45,212 --> 01:03:48,510
...only the junk turns out
to be a Rembrandt.

886
01:03:48,681 --> 01:03:52,241
About $ 100 billion head start
on everyone else.

887
01:03:52,417 --> 01:03:56,045
Apple was making tons of money.
It was great.

888
01:03:56,219 --> 01:04:00,917
And of course, I sort of lost my mind.
I mean, it was all fun and games.

889
01:04:01,089 --> 01:04:03,682
I started buying really expensive toys.

890
01:04:05,559 --> 01:04:07,925
<i>It was me with my own plane. </i>

891
01:04:08,093 --> 01:04:11,619
<i>Only problem was, maybe I wasn't
as good a pilot as I thought I was. </i>

892
01:04:11,796 --> 01:04:15,026
<i>I mean, it's one thing
when computers crash, but planes?</i>

893
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:16,427
<i>You don't want to know. </i>

894
01:04:23,771 --> 01:04:26,204
Hey, Steve. Are you just getting here?

895
01:04:26,372 --> 01:04:28,602
No, I was just outside
talking to the doctor.

896
01:04:28,774 --> 01:04:31,174
You don't remember us
talking 10 minutes ago?

897
01:04:31,343 --> 01:04:33,173
- We talked?
- Yeah.

898
01:04:33,344 --> 01:04:35,504
Hey, my hard disk crashed.

899
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:41,041
A computer guy with memory problems.

900
01:04:42,984 --> 01:04:44,883
Oh, man.

901
01:04:45,052 --> 01:04:48,248
It's the weirdest thing.
You know there's a part of your life there...

902
01:04:48,421 --> 01:04:50,388
...only you don't know about it.

903
01:04:50,555 --> 01:04:52,920
It makes you crazy.

904
01:05:07,333 --> 01:05:09,096
Hey.

905
01:05:10,268 --> 01:05:12,532
Hey!

906
01:05:14,638 --> 01:05:16,264
Paul.

907
01:05:16,439 --> 01:05:18,930
Simonyi, get Matthews.

908
01:05:19,108 --> 01:05:21,041
Ballmer, get in here.

909
01:05:24,011 --> 01:05:27,036
- What is it?
- This is seriously crummy.

910
01:05:27,213 --> 01:05:29,772
Apple's new computer, Lisa? We're dead.

911
01:05:29,948 --> 01:05:31,505
Oh, yeah, I've already seen one.

912
01:05:31,682 --> 01:05:33,945
The graphics and the operating system
they have...

913
01:05:34,117 --> 01:05:36,949
...they make what we're selling IBM
look a decade out-of-date.

914
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:39,246
- I want it.
- What do you mean, you want it?

915
01:05:39,421 --> 01:05:44,755
- It's Apple's. We can't just go and steal it.
- You're not listening to me. I want it.

916
01:05:44,925 --> 01:05:51,419
<i>Final call for TWA flight 2684
to San Jose. Final call. </i>

917
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:56,121
- Fifty bucks he misses the flight.
- You're on.

918
01:05:56,299 --> 01:05:58,266
It wouldn't hurt to buy a car radio, Bill.

919
01:05:58,433 --> 01:06:00,662
- I can't pick up the radio...
- One traffic report.

920
01:06:00,835 --> 01:06:03,326
- Hold on.
- Sir, we're on this plane.

921
01:06:03,504 --> 01:06:06,336
I'm sorry. Your plane is on the runway.

922
01:06:06,506 --> 01:06:08,564
Ma'am, what kind of service
is this today?

923
01:06:08,741 --> 01:06:12,675
I'm sorry, sir. There's nothing that can bring
that plane back to the gate.

924
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:16,505
Yes, there is. Willpower. I'm going to will
that that plane be turned around.

925
01:06:16,679 --> 01:06:18,771
- Oh, really?
- Really, sir.

926
01:06:18,947 --> 01:06:22,746
Are you aware that today in my briefcase
are computer language codes?

927
01:06:22,917 --> 01:06:25,510
- Do you know what they do, sir?
- I'm afraid I don't.

928
01:06:25,685 --> 01:06:28,744
They protect against viruses.
You're aware of viruses, I presume?

929
01:06:28,921 --> 01:06:33,288
- Sir, I do go to doctors.
- No, sir, computer viruses.

930
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:35,856
Oh, yeah, I just read an article
about those things.

931
01:06:36,026 --> 01:06:39,051
- They can wipe out a whole computer.
- A whole system of computers.

932
01:06:39,227 --> 01:06:42,423
Like the one behind your terminal there,
like the one in the plane...

933
01:06:42,596 --> 01:06:46,793
...like the one on all planes in the airlines,
like the one in the control tower, sir.

934
01:06:46,966 --> 01:06:50,264
I ask you, are you prepared
to take responsibility for your actions...

935
01:06:50,435 --> 01:06:53,460
...if I don't get this information
on that plane?

936
01:06:55,138 --> 01:06:59,506
Jeez, his reputation for inconveniencing
the rest of the world is intact.

937
01:06:59,675 --> 01:07:01,369
He actually missed a flight.

938
01:07:01,542 --> 01:07:05,307
<i>This is your captain speaking. We have
to return to the gate for a few minutes. </i>

939
01:07:05,478 --> 01:07:07,775
<i>Nothing critical. </i>

940
01:07:13,216 --> 01:07:18,083
<i>- Attention, please, flight... 
- Your tickets, please.</i>

941
01:07:18,253 --> 01:07:22,518
- You have the tickets, right?
- No, I gave them to you.

942
01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:26,022
Bill, in the car.

943
01:07:42,669 --> 01:07:45,831
Wow. These guys must be
50 times bigger than we are.

944
01:07:46,005 --> 01:07:48,996
Good artists copy. Great artists steal.

945
01:07:49,174 --> 01:07:52,665
- Oh, yeah? Who said that?
- Some artist. I think it was Van Gogh.

946
01:07:53,977 --> 01:07:56,843
Hey, check it out.

947
01:07:58,347 --> 01:08:03,339
Aye, matey. It wouldn't be time
to rape and pillage, would it?

948
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:14,355
You sure it's okay
to let these Microsoft guys in here?

949
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:17,591
We have culture. They don't.

950
01:08:17,926 --> 01:08:21,019
No taste. No original thinking.

951
01:08:21,662 --> 01:08:23,959
But they can be useful to us.

952
01:08:24,597 --> 01:08:27,360
Time for the dog and pony show.

953
01:08:36,405 --> 01:08:38,770
Welcome to Apple.

954
01:08:49,014 --> 01:08:50,708
Bill.

955
01:08:51,949 --> 01:08:53,848
Nice to see you. Thanks for coming.
Steve.

956
01:08:54,017 --> 01:08:56,917
- How you doing, Steve?
- Glad you're here. Paul. Hi, Steve Jobs.

957
01:08:57,085 --> 01:08:59,644
- Hi. Charles Simonyi.
- Come on in. Let me introduce you.

958
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:02,413
This is Gilmore.
He's one of our top programmers.

959
01:09:02,956 --> 01:09:05,549
And he's a loyal man.
Well, to do this, you need loyalty.

960
01:09:06,425 --> 01:09:09,621
- Total loyalty. Isn't that right?
- That's the plan, Steve.

961
01:09:10,394 --> 01:09:14,830
This way. The Macintosh team.
It's more like a family.

962
01:09:14,997 --> 01:09:17,829
Everybody else is an outsider.

963
01:09:17,999 --> 01:09:21,195
- What's with the pirate stuff?
- What do I always tell you?

964
01:09:21,669 --> 01:09:23,727
Better to be a pirate than join the Navy.

965
01:09:23,903 --> 01:09:27,065
- You a pirate?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely, Steve.

966
01:09:27,639 --> 01:09:29,401
I've been up for 52 hours straight.

967
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:32,269
Loyalty.

968
01:09:40,981 --> 01:09:43,005
I'm gonna show you the future.

969
01:09:43,182 --> 01:09:46,810
It's top-secret. It's still about...

970
01:09:46,985 --> 01:09:49,782
...a year away from introduction.

971
01:09:50,287 --> 01:09:53,153
The ultimate, insanely great...

972
01:09:54,724 --> 01:09:56,918
...fusion of art and science.

973
01:09:58,526 --> 01:10:02,655
- It's called the Macintosh.
- This is definitely not the Lisa.

974
01:10:02,829 --> 01:10:05,058
That's a graphic user interface.

975
01:10:05,230 --> 01:10:08,960
I don't understand. How does a computer
handle the mouse-cursor display?

976
01:10:09,133 --> 01:10:11,123
Hardware's got nothing to do
with the mouse.

977
01:10:11,301 --> 01:10:13,598
- It's all in the software.
- Enough.

978
01:10:13,769 --> 01:10:15,963
Sorry, Steve.

979
01:10:16,371 --> 01:10:19,828
There's no point in torturing our guests...

980
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:22,807
...with what they can't have.

981
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:33,777
You're vulnerable in spreadsheets,
you know, Steve.

982
01:10:33,949 --> 01:10:36,213
We can help you.

983
01:10:38,052 --> 01:10:41,282
Ninety hours a week. Like the T-shirt?
I'm gonna give it to my people.

984
01:10:43,723 --> 01:10:46,384
Some of them work even more
than 90 hours a week.

985
01:10:46,558 --> 01:10:49,458
We have Multiplan running on
dozens of different platforms.

986
01:10:49,626 --> 01:10:51,786
No one can match us.

987
01:10:52,595 --> 01:10:54,960
You can't just have employees anymore.

988
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:56,757
It's great.

989
01:10:57,732 --> 01:10:59,791
No, they gotta be into a crusade.

990
01:10:59,967 --> 01:11:05,665
It's like art, science, religion,
all rolled into one.

991
01:11:05,838 --> 01:11:09,897
We have multi-tool interface.
It can be redesigned for the Mac.

992
01:11:10,073 --> 01:11:13,735
Redesigned. Redesigned.

993
01:11:14,376 --> 01:11:16,570
We're artists here.

994
01:11:16,745 --> 01:11:19,372
A place where raw sand
comes in one end...

995
01:11:19,546 --> 01:11:23,675
...and goes out the other. Silicon art.

996
01:11:26,318 --> 01:11:30,514
You know, IBM, they're gonna want
all our stuff.

997
01:11:31,254 --> 01:11:32,653
IBM?

998
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:37,617
IBM, they're history.

999
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:43,228
I mean, they're 1950s, they're ice America,
a bloated enemy in a crumbling castle.

1000
01:11:43,395 --> 01:11:46,192
- And we're storming it.
- I know IBM is the enemy, Steve.

1001
01:11:46,364 --> 01:11:48,558
But we can help you.

1002
01:11:49,099 --> 01:11:51,032
You don't have to worry about IBM.

1003
01:11:51,768 --> 01:11:53,701
Yeah?

1004
01:11:53,869 --> 01:11:55,894
So why you even working with them?

1005
01:11:56,570 --> 01:11:59,232
I'd much rather work with you.

1006
01:12:09,146 --> 01:12:11,011
We're in.

1007
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:13,741
- We're doing work for Apple.
- You're kidding me.

1008
01:12:13,916 --> 01:12:16,850
They're sending us three prototypes
of the computer we just saw.

1009
01:12:17,018 --> 01:12:18,507
- The Macintosh.
- For God sakes.

1010
01:12:18,685 --> 01:12:22,450
There's a pirate flag flying above our heads,
and he's giving us the crown jewel?

1011
01:12:22,622 --> 01:12:24,248
Who the hell's the pirate here?

1012
01:12:24,422 --> 01:12:26,753
He sees what he believes,
not the other way around.

1013
01:12:26,924 --> 01:12:28,721
We're not his worst problem.

1014
01:12:28,893 --> 01:12:31,656
If he's not careful,
he's gonna wreck the place.

1015
01:12:32,661 --> 01:12:34,891
- Macintosh! Macintosh!
- Macintosh rules!

1016
01:12:35,062 --> 01:12:37,996
- Apple II's the best!
- Mac's the best!

1017
01:12:38,165 --> 01:12:41,429
<i>Even when I got my memory back,
it was never the same for me. </i>

1018
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,568
<i>I couldn't believe
how it had all changed. </i>

1019
01:12:43,736 --> 01:12:45,862
<i>Apple was tearing itself to pieces. </i>

1020
01:12:46,471 --> 01:12:49,030
<i>Steve had turned it into two camps:</i>

1021
01:12:49,206 --> 01:12:53,732
<i>His new Macintosh group
against everyone else in the company. </i>

1022
01:12:57,878 --> 01:13:00,573
Steve, what the hell is this?

1023
01:13:01,114 --> 01:13:04,912
It's like a family. Things get messy.

1024
01:13:05,316 --> 01:13:06,681
I don't understand this.

1025
01:13:06,851 --> 01:13:10,013
You got the Mac people
against the Apple II people?

1026
01:13:10,187 --> 01:13:12,279
- They're beating each other up.
- Amazing, huh?

1027
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:15,889
People wanna be shaped, molded.

1028
01:13:16,057 --> 01:13:18,786
But if you asked any of them,
any of them, they'd deny it.

1029
01:13:19,393 --> 01:13:23,725
I don't wanna shape anybody, Steve.
This isn't fun anymore.

1030
01:13:23,895 --> 01:13:27,455
Maybe fun is just fragments of existence
with better packaging.

1031
01:13:29,365 --> 01:13:30,832
I don't make jokes anymore.

1032
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,832
I told you a long time ago, I like jokes.

1033
01:13:35,002 --> 01:13:40,267
Steve! Goodbye. I'm quitting Apple.

1034
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:46,407
- Well, that's a joke, right?
- No. I'm going back to college.

1035
01:13:46,577 --> 01:13:52,377
Woz. Hey, what are you doing?
I don't think it's such a good idea.

1036
01:13:52,547 --> 01:13:56,448
All I'm doing now is being a brake pedal
for you as you're heading for the wall.

1037
01:13:59,052 --> 01:14:01,281
Woz!

1038
01:14:30,739 --> 01:14:33,673
- I ask you for brilliance?
- Steve.

1039
01:14:33,841 --> 01:14:38,800
I've asked you for genius,
and you're giving me this?

1040
01:14:40,079 --> 01:14:42,013
Steve, please.

1041
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:54,983
Oh, no, Steve, not again.

1042
01:14:55,155 --> 01:14:59,113
It's 3 a. m., okay? I don't have the energy
to defend an unfinished design.

1043
01:14:59,292 --> 01:15:02,818
That's because there's nothing to defend.

1044
01:15:02,995 --> 01:15:07,327
I want beauty, not incompetence.

1045
01:15:08,064 --> 01:15:10,122
Are you listening to me?

1046
01:15:10,866 --> 01:15:12,765
- Are you listening...?
- Yes, I'm listening!

1047
01:15:12,934 --> 01:15:15,027
I am so sick of your abusiveness.

1048
01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:19,396
That's all you know.
Tearing people down, throwing tantrums.

1049
01:15:19,572 --> 01:15:24,974
- You miserable son of a bitch.
- What are you doing? Come on, back off.

1050
01:15:39,318 --> 01:15:42,343
<i>I know we've been in a battle... </i>

1051
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:46,046
...and like all battles,
we've had our casualties along the way.

1052
01:15:46,857 --> 01:15:48,551
But today's about celebrating.

1053
01:15:50,526 --> 01:15:52,049
The Macintosh.

1054
01:15:58,631 --> 01:16:00,598
It's time for a christening...

1055
01:16:02,434 --> 01:16:05,197
...of our little Macintosh.

1056
01:16:05,369 --> 01:16:07,268
Our baby.

1057
01:16:17,077 --> 01:16:19,772
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1058
01:16:21,513 --> 01:16:24,345
Real artists ship.

1059
01:16:24,782 --> 01:16:28,273
In this company, in Apple,
in the entire business...

1060
01:16:28,451 --> 01:16:33,182
...we, you, the Macintosh team,
are the only true artists.

1061
01:16:33,354 --> 01:16:36,049
You can forget Apple, forget Lisa.

1062
01:16:36,222 --> 01:16:39,748
It's only us. The Macintosh team.

1063
01:16:39,925 --> 01:16:42,757
We have been chosen to seize history.

1064
01:16:44,161 --> 01:16:49,826
But first, carpe diem, seize the day.
It's your time to party, people.

1065
01:16:52,167 --> 01:16:54,157
Hey, John.

1066
01:16:54,835 --> 01:16:56,392
You hear what I heard in there?

1067
01:17:24,488 --> 01:17:28,389
- Hey, man, what'd you say about Steve?
- I'm sick of his crap.

1068
01:17:28,557 --> 01:17:30,422
- What'd you say, man?
- You heard me.

1069
01:17:30,592 --> 01:17:32,786
You wanna talk like that about Steve?

1070
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:35,621
You wanna talk like that about the guy
who feeds you, man?

1071
01:17:35,795 --> 01:17:39,696
- The guy who feeds you?
- Come on. Break it up.

1072
01:17:39,865 --> 01:17:41,661
Come on.

1073
01:17:43,134 --> 01:17:45,567
- Hey, hey, guys.
- Somebody pull him off.

1074
01:17:46,003 --> 01:17:48,835
- Never like this at Pepsi-Cola.
- Knock it off.

1075
01:17:49,304 --> 01:17:52,102
You wanna sell sugar water
the rest of your life?

1076
01:18:05,482 --> 01:18:07,711
Steve, I'm worried.

1077
01:18:10,184 --> 01:18:11,617
Yeah?

1078
01:18:11,786 --> 01:18:14,481
Yeah, about what's happening.

1079
01:18:14,921 --> 01:18:19,549
All the, you know, "them versus us" stuff.
Macintosh versus Apple II.

1080
01:18:19,724 --> 01:18:23,181
You don't understand, John.
People need a cause.

1081
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:26,726
We missed Vietnam. This is our Vietnam.

1082
01:18:27,963 --> 01:18:31,625
- It's tearing the company apart.
- Creation is messy.

1083
01:18:31,799 --> 01:18:34,596
You want genius, you get madness.
Two sides of the same coin.

1084
01:18:34,768 --> 01:18:36,860
You knew that when I brought you in.

1085
01:18:37,036 --> 01:18:39,596
Steve, if you can't trust me,
then God help you.

1086
01:18:39,771 --> 01:18:42,762
I didn't mention anything
about trust, John.

1087
01:18:46,409 --> 01:18:47,706
There's another problem.

1088
01:18:50,311 --> 01:18:52,870
- It's Arlene and the baby.
- That's my business.

1089
01:18:53,047 --> 01:18:57,107
<i>No, not anymore.
TIME magazine is doing another story.</i>

1090
01:18:57,283 --> 01:18:59,546
You don't need the bad press.
Neither do we.

1091
01:18:59,718 --> 01:19:02,652
- Child's not mine.
- Steve, come on. You took a paternity test.

1092
01:19:03,486 --> 01:19:05,920
She is yours.
It's right there in the results.

1093
01:19:06,089 --> 01:19:10,581
- Paternity tests are a joke.
- She's asking for $20,000.

1094
01:19:10,758 --> 01:19:13,157
- Total, nothing more.
- Blackmail.

1095
01:19:13,326 --> 01:19:16,294
Steve, you can afford the money.
Give her what she's asking for.

1096
01:19:16,462 --> 01:19:19,191
- You should give her more.
- It's not about the damn money.

1097
01:19:19,531 --> 01:19:21,725
Well, what is it, then?

1098
01:19:21,899 --> 01:19:23,992
I don't know.

1099
01:20:15,968 --> 01:20:18,697
Mommy, there's a man here.

1100
01:20:35,714 --> 01:20:38,910
It's been what, a year?

1101
01:20:41,918 --> 01:20:45,876
- Yeah, I've been busy.
- I'm sure.

1102
01:20:48,089 --> 01:20:51,990
- Why'd you come?
- I don't know.

1103
01:20:54,026 --> 01:20:55,926
She's looking really good.

1104
01:21:02,265 --> 01:21:04,665
You should have come to see her.

1105
01:21:04,834 --> 01:21:08,893
- You could have brought her by.
- Oh, Steve.

1106
01:21:11,605 --> 01:21:13,539
Here.

1107
01:21:23,746 --> 01:21:25,679
Thank you.

1108
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:28,272
Thank you, Lisa.

1109
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:07,940
- Steve Jobs is killing us. Ballmer!
- Yeah?

1110
01:22:08,109 --> 01:22:10,077
This stuff is crummy. It's totally crummy.

1111
01:22:10,243 --> 01:22:13,075
- Windows was supposed to ship last year.
- We're ready for you.

1112
01:22:13,245 --> 01:22:15,713
Why do I have to do this?
I have work. This is stupid.

1113
01:22:15,881 --> 01:22:18,007
<i>It's good PR.
It's for The Wall Street Journal.</i>

1114
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:20,912
- I don't need PR.
- Can you stand a little to the left?

1115
01:22:21,084 --> 01:22:24,519
The hole in that sweater of your shirt.
Turn all the way to the right.

1116
01:22:24,687 --> 01:22:26,278
What am I, a trained seal?

1117
01:22:26,454 --> 01:22:29,616
- Lf Apple can do this, why can't we?
- What do you want us to do?

1118
01:22:29,790 --> 01:22:31,916
- Whatever you have to.
- Meaning what, Bill?

1119
01:22:32,091 --> 01:22:34,217
Meaning ship Windows
before the snow falls.

1120
01:22:34,393 --> 01:22:36,986
- This is Seattle. It doesn't snow here.
- Whatever, Steve.

1121
01:22:37,161 --> 01:22:39,629
Mr. Gates, I think you should
take off your sweater...

1122
01:22:39,796 --> 01:22:41,923
...because it clashes
with the background.

1123
01:22:42,098 --> 01:22:44,258
The green and blue,
it's just not in these days.

1124
01:22:44,433 --> 01:22:46,423
It's not in at all.

1125
01:22:46,601 --> 01:22:50,036
Sweat stains. This is awful.

1126
01:22:56,308 --> 01:22:59,640
- I'd like to get back to work...
- I know, we're almost ready.

1127
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:06,111
Okay, and three, two, one.
Smile, please.

1128
01:23:06,981 --> 01:23:09,108
Urgent, Mr. Gates.

1129
01:23:09,283 --> 01:23:12,046
Thank you. What's next?

1130
01:23:13,485 --> 01:23:15,316
Steve Jobs.

1131
01:23:15,653 --> 01:23:18,416
"Mr. Jobs demands you be
in his office tonight. "

1132
01:23:20,090 --> 01:23:22,080
He's getting paranoid
over what we're doing.

1133
01:23:22,525 --> 01:23:23,856
Maybe he should be.

1134
01:23:25,126 --> 01:23:27,151
Not at the pace you're going.

1135
01:23:27,328 --> 01:23:29,319
I think I had a date tonight with Ann.

1136
01:23:29,496 --> 01:23:31,520
- I thought she was away on business.
- She is.

1137
01:23:31,698 --> 01:23:33,255
Then how can you have a date?

1138
01:23:33,432 --> 01:23:37,231
Well, I go to a movie here, and then
she goes to the same movie in Denver...

1139
01:23:37,401 --> 01:23:40,028
...and then we talk on the phone
about it afterwards.

1140
01:23:40,203 --> 01:23:44,366
Jeez, Bill, I hate to see what happens
when you two have sex.

1141
01:24:27,701 --> 01:24:30,692
You're stealing from us!

1142
01:24:33,338 --> 01:24:36,670
Steve, we're not stealing from you.
So don't tell me that.

1143
01:24:38,009 --> 01:24:39,669
What the hell are you doing, then?

1144
01:24:39,843 --> 01:24:44,301
What is this that I keep hearing
about you developing this...?

1145
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:47,073
What do you call it? Windows?

1146
01:24:47,247 --> 01:24:49,579
To compete with us?

1147
01:24:52,151 --> 01:24:56,518
- I'm not doing anything against you, Steve.
- Don't give me that crap!

1148
01:24:56,687 --> 01:24:59,985
You're pirating the software
off our Mac prototypes!

1149
01:25:00,156 --> 01:25:01,817
I trusted you.

1150
01:25:02,391 --> 01:25:06,827
If you wanna know everything
we're working on, I'll show you.

1151
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:15,764
<i>The weird thing was... </i>

1152
01:25:15,933 --> 01:25:19,629
<i>... Steve Jobs was the one guy
Bill would never yell at. It was the opposite. </i>

1153
01:25:19,803 --> 01:25:23,032
<i>Steve would order Bill to fly down there
and then blow up at him... </i>

1154
01:25:23,204 --> 01:25:26,900
<i>... but Bill, he would just wait it out,
convince Steve that we were no threat... </i>

1155
01:25:27,074 --> 01:25:30,668
<i>... that this Windows stuff was just
that much more smoke and mirrors... </i>

1156
01:25:30,843 --> 01:25:33,106
<i>... and a few hours later,
everything was fine. </i>

1157
01:25:33,278 --> 01:25:35,336
<i>I'm telling you, Bill's a genius at it. </i>

1158
01:25:36,614 --> 01:25:38,877
And that's all you're working on?

1159
01:25:39,349 --> 01:25:40,577
Of course.

1160
01:25:41,483 --> 01:25:43,780
- Yeah?
- You know what else?

1161
01:25:44,085 --> 01:25:47,679
Did you read what I said in that
newspaper story on us two days ago?

1162
01:25:48,121 --> 01:25:51,146
- No. What'd you say?
- I said when your Macintosh comes out...

1163
01:25:51,324 --> 01:25:54,190
...that'd be the only computer
I'd want to buy my mom.

1164
01:25:54,559 --> 01:25:56,788
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1165
01:25:57,294 --> 01:25:59,853
Your mom, huh?

1166
01:26:00,029 --> 01:26:04,464
- It's like we're one big family, you know?
- Family?

1167
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:08,528
You know that.

1168
01:26:12,905 --> 01:26:14,963
Family.

1169
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:18,531
<i>Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve!</i>

1170
01:26:32,217 --> 01:26:33,741
Tell me something.

1171
01:26:33,919 --> 01:26:37,080
When did this stop being a business
and start being a religion?

1172
01:26:37,253 --> 01:26:38,652
Thank you for your work.

1173
01:26:38,822 --> 01:26:43,689
And remember, what we will do
in the next year...

1174
01:26:43,858 --> 01:26:46,883
...will change the way people think...

1175
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:49,357
...and communicate.

1176
01:26:51,930 --> 01:26:53,761
Hey.

1177
01:26:53,932 --> 01:26:55,592
- Hey.
- So enjoy the revolution...

1178
01:26:55,766 --> 01:26:59,223
...which we have all created and watch...

1179
01:26:59,402 --> 01:27:01,266
You know, Steve thinks IBM's the enemy.

1180
01:27:01,436 --> 01:27:02,767
- Unfolds in front of us.

1181
01:27:02,938 --> 01:27:05,201
He doesn't get it.

1182
01:27:05,373 --> 01:27:07,067
You guys are.

1183
01:27:10,142 --> 01:27:12,201
What are you talking about?

1184
01:27:12,378 --> 01:27:15,107
Copies of your Windows
just started surfacing here.

1185
01:27:15,279 --> 01:27:16,768
You took our stuff, Bill.

1186
01:27:16,947 --> 01:27:20,347
You took our stuff, you fooled with it,
and you called it your own.

1187
01:27:22,584 --> 01:27:25,780
You always insult your guests like this?

1188
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:28,680
Make no mistake.

1189
01:27:28,855 --> 01:27:32,654
We are all one big family.

1190
01:27:33,624 --> 01:27:36,751
And part of it
are our friends at Microsoft.

1191
01:27:41,397 --> 01:27:43,489
Bill?

1192
01:27:48,634 --> 01:27:51,101
Ladies and gentlemen, Bill Gates.

1193
01:27:55,439 --> 01:27:58,601
Finally, I wanna show you a preview...

1194
01:27:58,775 --> 01:28:02,437
...of the most amazing 60 seconds of film
you'll ever see.

1195
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:04,840
And we're showing it only once...

1196
01:28:05,012 --> 01:28:06,501
...during the Super Bowl.

1197
01:28:06,679 --> 01:28:09,875
So watch and see how we handle IBM.

1198
01:28:10,382 --> 01:28:12,975
I mean Big Brother.

1199
01:28:15,452 --> 01:28:19,012
<i>See, that commercial was interesting
in a lot of ways... </i>

1200
01:28:19,188 --> 01:28:22,156
<i>... because when we're at
this big hoopla at Apple... </i>

1201
01:28:22,323 --> 01:28:26,053
<i>... and their engineers are unpacking
all these Japanese computers... </i>

1202
01:28:26,226 --> 01:28:28,750
<i>... with the first copies
of our stuff, Windows... </i>

1203
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:32,192
<i>... that looks a lot like their stuff... </i>

1204
01:28:32,364 --> 01:28:34,354
<i>I mean, if I had to pick a moment... </i>

1205
01:28:44,405 --> 01:28:46,133
Hey...

1206
01:28:46,306 --> 01:28:48,967
...I'm getting
some pretty weird vibes here.

1207
01:28:49,141 --> 01:28:51,005
Sure we should stay around?

1208
01:28:51,776 --> 01:28:56,235
Sometimes you deal them.
Sometimes you fold them.

1209
01:28:57,980 --> 01:29:00,447
Now's not the time to fold.

1210
01:29:01,950 --> 01:29:05,509
<i>We shall prevail. </i>

1211
01:29:10,756 --> 01:29:13,690
I obviously made a mistake.

1212
01:29:16,259 --> 01:29:17,987
I made a mistake.

1213
01:29:19,395 --> 01:29:21,487
I trusted.

1214
01:29:22,430 --> 01:29:24,693
I believed.

1215
01:29:26,165 --> 01:29:28,429
Family.

1216
01:29:31,069 --> 01:29:34,731
Maybe a Mafia family.
You turn your back, and you get whacked.

1217
01:29:34,904 --> 01:29:39,237
Our guys come back from Japan
with this NEC...

1218
01:29:40,275 --> 01:29:44,835
...and it's loaded with Microsoft programs.
Your Microsoft programs.

1219
01:29:45,011 --> 01:29:47,672
They're almost identical to ours.

1220
01:29:50,849 --> 01:29:53,578
There may be some similarities, Steve.

1221
01:29:56,619 --> 01:29:58,280
Similarities?

1222
01:30:01,689 --> 01:30:04,055
Similarities?

1223
01:30:06,292 --> 01:30:09,192
- Try theft.
- Steve, all cars have steering wheels...

1224
01:30:09,361 --> 01:30:12,761
...but no one tries to claim
that the steering wheel was their invention.

1225
01:30:12,930 --> 01:30:17,024
- We have a contract, you and I.
- Well, you should read it more carefully.

1226
01:30:17,199 --> 01:30:19,030
What is this?

1227
01:30:19,501 --> 01:30:21,901
This is like doing business with...

1228
01:30:22,070 --> 01:30:23,331
...like, a praying mantis.

1229
01:30:23,504 --> 01:30:26,563
You get seduced
and then eaten alive afterwards.

1230
01:30:26,939 --> 01:30:29,065
Get real, will you?

1231
01:30:30,742 --> 01:30:34,938
You and I are both like guys
that have this rich neighbor...

1232
01:30:35,111 --> 01:30:37,203
...Xerox...

1233
01:30:37,379 --> 01:30:39,677
...that left the door open all the time.

1234
01:30:39,848 --> 01:30:42,714
And you go sneaking in
to steal the TV set.

1235
01:30:43,116 --> 01:30:47,415
Only when you get there,
you realize that I got there first.

1236
01:30:47,586 --> 01:30:49,951
I got the loot, Steve!

1237
01:30:50,722 --> 01:30:52,484
And you're yelling?

1238
01:30:52,656 --> 01:30:55,283
"That's not fair.

1239
01:30:55,458 --> 01:30:58,551
I wanted to try to steal it first. "

1240
01:31:04,197 --> 01:31:06,324
You're too late.

1241
01:31:12,802 --> 01:31:15,168
We're better than you are.

1242
01:31:19,874 --> 01:31:24,037
- We have better stuff.
- You don't get it, Steve.

1243
01:31:25,111 --> 01:31:27,704
That doesn't matter.

1244
01:31:46,058 --> 01:31:49,788
<i>You know, like a lot of things,
there always seems to be one last time. </i>

1245
01:31:49,961 --> 01:31:52,190
<i>For us, it was when we all
came together again... </i>

1246
01:31:52,362 --> 01:31:55,091
<i>... for this big party
Steve threw for his 30th birthday. </i>

1247
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:57,288
<i>It was just one of those things. </i>

1248
01:31:57,465 --> 01:32:00,262
<i>You know, where you try really hard
to make something work... </i>

1249
01:32:00,434 --> 01:32:02,732
<i>... but somehow it just doesn't. </i>

1250
01:32:02,903 --> 01:32:06,030
<i>And maybe you should have known it
all along. </i>

1251
01:32:10,007 --> 01:32:13,533
- Is that really Ella Fitzgerald?
- I have absolutely no idea.

1252
01:32:16,812 --> 01:32:18,711
You hear the kind of food
they're serving?

1253
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:21,473
- Salmon mousse, goat's cheese.
- I can't eat that stuff.

1254
01:32:21,648 --> 01:32:24,878
- Why don't we go to Denny's?
- Is that Joan Baez with him?

1255
01:32:25,051 --> 01:32:26,847
Wait, wait. Who's Joan Baez?

1256
01:32:28,086 --> 01:32:30,212
- Hi.
- John.

1257
01:32:36,658 --> 01:32:38,989
I need to talk to you. It's important.

1258
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:41,458
Okay, John. Excuse me.

1259
01:32:46,532 --> 01:32:49,591
We've got a problem.
We've been asked to make a toast to Steve.

1260
01:32:49,767 --> 01:32:54,168
Me? Toast Steve? No way, man.
Not after what's happened. No way.

1261
01:32:54,337 --> 01:32:58,295
Oh, John, don't look at me. L...
Mike, you do it.

1262
01:32:58,473 --> 01:33:02,067
After the past few months?
I don't think so.

1263
01:33:02,675 --> 01:33:05,541
John, you're the one.

1264
01:33:05,711 --> 01:33:09,669
- No. Not now. Absolutely no way.
- Why not?

1265
01:33:10,047 --> 01:33:13,015
- Look, Steve thinks I'm his...
- He thinks you're what?

1266
01:33:23,289 --> 01:33:25,917
Ladies and gentlemen, a toast.

1267
01:33:26,224 --> 01:33:28,249
To a remarkable man.

1268
01:33:28,426 --> 01:33:30,256
A man who brought me
to this company...

1269
01:33:30,761 --> 01:33:33,991
...without whom none of this tonight
would ever have happened.

1270
01:33:34,163 --> 01:33:38,757
Steve Jobs, truly a guiding light.
A man who sees the future.

1271
01:33:38,933 --> 01:33:40,161
- Hear, hear!
- Steve.

1272
01:33:40,334 --> 01:33:41,630
Happy birthday!

1273
01:33:47,905 --> 01:33:51,362
It's weird, but sometimes you find things
that are more important to you...

1274
01:33:51,541 --> 01:33:55,374
...than the things you think are important.
You know what I mean?

1275
01:33:55,544 --> 01:33:58,376
Maybe it's just getting older.

1276
01:34:00,147 --> 01:34:04,344
Okay, guys. Let's see how we did.

1277
01:34:05,717 --> 01:34:06,945
That's a good one.

1278
01:34:18,826 --> 01:34:20,383
It's true.

1279
01:34:21,728 --> 01:34:25,719
We're learning about the size of the sun
versus the size of the Earth.

1280
01:34:38,039 --> 01:34:39,472
<i>Hi, Steve. </i>

1281
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:43,404
<i>I think it's gonna be really interesting,
I mean, you and me together. </i>

1282
01:34:43,809 --> 01:34:45,640
Yeah.

1283
01:34:47,612 --> 01:34:49,602
It is.

1284
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:02,399
