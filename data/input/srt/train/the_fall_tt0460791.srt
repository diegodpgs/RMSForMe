1
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,950
Nurse Evelyn! Nurse Evelyn!

2
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:17,818
I have a message for you. In English!

3
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,605
And here we go.

4
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:42,080
Now, look, here's the list of all the patients
we've had in the ward in the last month.

5
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,617
Thank you, Nurse.

6
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,958
- You're Alexandria?
- Yes.

7
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:05,259
Your note came in, and landed on my lap.

8
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,561
Couldn't even understand it.
It's written in gibberish or something.

9
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:12,366
You didn't understand it, didn't you,
didn't understand it, it's not for you.

10
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,233
My name's Roy.

11
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,880
- How'd you hurt your arm?
- I fell.

12
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,139
Me too.

13
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,083
I was picking oranges.

14
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,854
Is that so?

15
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,361
How do you go to the potty?

16
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:38,488
I don't. They let me go right here.

17
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,294
- In bed?
- Yeah, it's true.

18
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,959
I don't believe.

19
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,104
Hey, Alexandria.

20
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:50,734
Hey, do you know
you're named after Alexander the Great

21
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,608
who was the greatest warrior
who ever lived?

22
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:57,445
Yes. And my note is not in gibberish.
It's in English!

23
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,985
Hey, I can see you. Come on out here.

24
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,788
I can see you hiding.

25
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,455
Alexandria.

26
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:13,996
Hey, did you know
he was also looking for a message?

27
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,403
<i>He was lost.</i>

28
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:26,701
<i>He almost died, separated from his army.</i>

29
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:31,415
- Did he find the message?
- What?

30
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:35,147
Did she find the message?
Alexandria the Great.

31
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,951
All right, right, I'll tell you,
just come in here.

32
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,359
Now, come on, grab that chair right there.

33
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,892
All right, don't break your other arm.

34
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,266
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

35
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,413
- What's in your box?
- Things I like.

36
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:08,716
- Things you stole?
- No.

37
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:11,688
A photo.

38
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,320
Where'd you get the elephant?

39
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,795
My friend gave it to me at work.

40
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,794
He's from India.

41
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,239
Look, this is my horse

42
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:33,202
- and this is my father.
- Yeah?

43
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,708
He's got the same gap in his teeth,
must run in the family.

44
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,445
- Yeah, and here is my house.
- Oh, yeah?

45
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,045
- It was my house.
- What happened?

46
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:45,682
- They burn it.
- Who burned it?

47
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,092
Angry people.

48
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,520
I'm sorry to hear that.

49
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,629
I said, I'm sorry to hear that.

50
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:56,795
Angry people.

51
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,667
Yeah, I know,
I'm just sorry that your house got burned.

52
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,969
Why did Alexander

53
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:07,138
didn't go from that buildings on his horse?

54
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,546
- If him was lost...
- What?

55
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:16,612
Why did Alexander didn't go
from that middle of the buildings

56
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,749
from that buildings on his horse?

57
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,391
Well...

58
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:30,560
<i>First of all, he didn't have a horse
because his horse was killed in a battle.</i>

59
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:36,137
<i>And he wasn't
in the middle of any old buildings.</i>

60
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:42,579
<i>He was lost in the middle of a vast desert,
full of orange sand</i>

61
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,673
<i>with only a handful of men</i>

62
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,421
<i>but they didn't have any water.</i>

63
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:13,303
Look!

64
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,304
<i>"My Lord, all hope is lost.</i>

65
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:46,243
<i>"It seems your mighty army
shall finally be conquered.</i>

66
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:51,648
<i>"Not by the Persians, but by our own greed
and gluttony for water.</i>

67
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,709
<i>"This helmet contains our last supply.</i>

68
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:59,521
<i>"Oh, King,
I believe your wisdom shall save us all. "</i>

69
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,466
- Why?
- Why?

70
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:11,628
What?

71
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,131
Why?

72
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:19,775
Well, because there wasn't
enough water for all of them

73
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,370
and it was Alexander the Great's way

74
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,008
of showing his army
that they were all equal...

75
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,915
It's stupid.

76
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,351
What would you do better?

77
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,981
Was Alexander throw the water

78
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:35,824
instead to give every soldier a little bit.

79
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,531
Hey, why don't you come back tomorrow
and I'm going to tell you a different story.

80
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:49,438
An epic tale of love and revenge.

81
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,806
- You know what "epic" means?
- No.

82
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,107
I still got this tightness here.
It's like I can't even...

83
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,513
It means a really long story,
and it's set in India.

84
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,982
...the elephant sitting on my chest.

85
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,985
- You should be fully recovered.
- All right, go on.

86
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,987
- I want you to examine me.
- Will you come back tomorrow?

87
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,819
You personally. I'm not very well.

88
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,661
The swelling seems down.

89
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,828
I know how much it hurts.

90
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,142
A sense of humor.

91
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:29,477
In the next couple of weeks the pain
should abate, then one more operation.

92
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,311
Like the last one?

93
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:34,375
This is going to take some effort
on your part, too, you know that?

94
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:35,579
See?

95
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:24,959
Come on, then.

96
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,752
- Be back before lunch.
- Okay.

97
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,938
Alexandria, get away from that ice.

98
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:13,007
I see you licking that ice,
you're gonna get sick.

99
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,053
I want you to go play, go!

100
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,248
Next time, I'll glue your lips to this
and carry you away.

101
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,322
You're lucky it was just a horse
that got killed.

102
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,426
I mean, jumping off a train bridge
was suicide, too.

103
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,562
And if you were trying to impress her...

104
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,600
Sinclair already did a better job.

105
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,439
You know, the actor,

106
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:43,638
- the leading man.
- I know who he is.

107
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,986
Every cloud has a silver lining,
that's for sure.

108
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,111
Take another card.

109
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,782
- You know, before my accident...
- That is the Queen of Hearts.

110
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,188
...nothing was happening for me.

111
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:56,888
Now I've had my leg hacked off by savages,

112
00:14:56,962 --> 00:15:00,728
mangled by chariots,
sawed off by lumberjacks.

113
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,929
Hell, I've even had a harpoon through it.
I'm working all the time.

114
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,803
That is the two of spades.

115
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,846
- The studio is just trying to do right by you.
- Excuse me, Mr. Sabatini.

116
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,041
Take the money.

117
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,415
Anyway, gags are not for you, Roy.

118
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:21,783
You're a college man.

119
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:22,878
Wasn't me.

120
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,650
One cripple to another...

121
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,052
I didn't throw orange at you.

122
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,220
...no woman is worth suicide.

123
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,655
Like the guy's a movie star, for chrissake.

124
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,679
Was your friend a pirate?

125
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,150
Was your friend a pirate?

126
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,223
Sometimes.

127
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:05,092
Is that how he hurt his leg?

128
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:09,260
No, he... He does tricks for pictures.

129
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:12,133
You know, flickers.

130
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,104
Moving pictures.

131
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:18,168
- I never seen one.
- You're not missing much.

132
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,039
Is that what you do, like your friend?

133
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,282
Just once.

134
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,420
Will you tell me the story now?

135
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,016
- What story?
- The epic.

136
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,229
All right.

137
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,659
All right, close your eyes.

138
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,065
What do you see?

139
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:51,770
Nothing.

140
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:55,910
Rub them.

141
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,412
Can you see the stars?

142
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,183
<i>Yes.</i>

143
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:05,515
<i>It was a starry night.</i>

144
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:10,324
<i>Four men waited impatiently
on a small island</i>

145
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,388
<i>surrounded by a calm sea.</i>

146
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:16,662
<i>But that calmness was deceptive.</i>

147
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,837
<i>For at that moment</i>

148
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:28,346
<i>an Indian with a bandaged thigh
swam towards them.</i>

149
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,812
Tell me, Indian.

150
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,280
Is it true?

151
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:46,487
Luigi, is what true?

152
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,660
Governor Odious will execute
your twin brother tomorrow morning.

153
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,634
My poor brother.

154
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,781
<i>In all, there were five of them.</i>

155
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,511
<i>They had only one thing in common,</i>

156
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,520
<i>a hatred of Governor Odious.</i>

157
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:15,822
<i>The first was an ex-slave, Otta Benga.</i>

158
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:27,061
<i>He and his brother were born into slavery</i>

159
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:31,269
<i>only to fill the coffers
of the evil Governor Odious.</i>

160
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:37,212
<i>One day while toiling in the fields...</i>

161
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:55,329
<i>Heartbroken at his brother's death,
he freed the slaves</i>

162
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,803
<i>and swore that he would be responsible
for Governor Odious's death.</i>

163
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,908
<i>I like him.</i>

164
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,276
<i>Then, there was the Indian,</i>

165
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:12,181
<i>who, whenever anxious,
always stroked his brow.</i>

166
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:23,118
<i>The Indian was supposedly married
to the most beautiful squaw in the world</i>

167
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,857
<i>yet nobody had seen her.</i>

168
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:30,368
<i>To verify this,
Odious disguised himself as a leper</i>

169
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:34,428
<i>but when he saw her reflection,
he was smitten.</i>

170
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:43,278
<i>Locking the doors to his wigwam,
the Indian stood guard.</i>

171
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:47,341
<i>Little did he know,
he was guarding an empty home</i>

172
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:52,356
<i>for his wife had already been kidnapped
by the evil Governor Odious.</i>

173
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:57,122
<i>But the squaw refused
to show herself to him.</i>

174
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:01,098
<i>So, Odious had her thrown
into the Labyrinth of Despair.</i>

175
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:09,835
<i>Eventually she realized
there was only one way out.</i>

176
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,283
<i>While mourning his wife's death</i>

177
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,920
<i>the Indian took a blood oath
never to look at another squaw</i>

178
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:34,830
<i>and that he would be responsible
for Governor Odious's death.</i>

179
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,096
<i>I like him, too.</i>

180
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:45,302
<i>Luigi was an explosive expert.</i>

181
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,074
<i>When Odious heard
about the power of his new bombs,</i>

182
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,379
<i>he had him publicly banished.</i>

183
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:58,282
<i>On his return, Luigi discovered
that everybody hid from him</i>

184
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:02,760
<i>because even speaking to him
was punishable by death.</i>

185
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:07,195
<i>But when his own priest refused
to hear his confession,</i>

186
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:14,195
<i>Luigi swore that he would be responsible
for Governor Odious's death!</i>

187
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:22,273
<i>Next was the English naturalist</i>

188
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,910
<i>Charles Darwin.</i>

189
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:29,181
<i>He loved all living things,</i>

190
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:34,157
<i>creatures, plants, everything alive.</i>

191
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:40,161
<i>Darwin was always accompanied
by his shy, brilliant colleague,</i>

192
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:41,460
<i>Wallace the monkey.</i>

193
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,057
What is that, Wallace?

194
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,432
I don't know why flamingos are pink.

195
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:51,442
<i>Even though they had developed
many theories together</i>

196
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:55,039
<i>they were still looking for something.</i>

197
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:59,083
<i>- What?
- Butterfly.</i>

198
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,115
<i>That's a good guess.</i>

199
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:06,984
<i>In fact, a very specific butterfly</i>

200
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:10,460
<i>called Americana Exotica.</i>

201
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:15,298
<i>One day, Odious sent them a dead one.</i>

202
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,334
<i>Butterfly Reef.</i>

203
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:30,737
<i>This Odious, it's bad man?</i>

204
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,279
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

205
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,244
<i>Butterfly Reef.</i>

206
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:41,055
<i>That's where Governor Odious
chose to banish our heroes,</i>

207
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:43,961
<i>to mock them,</i>

208
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:50,291
<i>hoping that in their fight for survival
they would devour each other.</i>

209
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:54,997
<i>So, the buccaneers
were trapped on this island.</i>

210
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:56,938
<i>What means a buccaneer?</i>

211
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:02,507
<i>Well, it's like a pirate. Pirate and buccaneer,
it's like the same thing.</i>

212
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,981
But I don't like pirate stories.

213
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:09,750
You're the one who asked for a pirate story.

214
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:12,187
- No.
- Yes, you did.

215
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:18,052
I just wanted to know
if your friend was a pirate.

216
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,896
- Why?
- Because he has just one leg.

217
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:24,696
Oh, right.

218
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:30,470
Well, yeah, it's not a pirate story.
It's a story about bandits.

219
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:34,538
<i>In fact, our masked hero
couldn't even swim.</i>

220
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,239
I need to learn to swim.

221
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:47,454
Finally, very little was known about
the gap-toothed Masked Bandit.

222
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,653
<i>- Like my father?
- Yes, your father.</i>

223
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:56,958
<i>Except that he and his twin brother,
the Blue Bandit,</i>

224
00:23:57,035 --> 00:24:00,801
<i>had escaped execution
from the Spanish Governor Odious.</i>

225
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,867
<i>Knowing that their chances of survival
were better apart</i>

226
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,435
<i>the two brothers separated</i>

227
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:11,971
<i>swearing that
they would kill Governor Odious.</i>

228
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,847
We must conceive a plan!

229
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:23,652
I need to get off this island,
and rescue my twin brother.

230
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,036
What? What?

231
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,101
All elephants?

232
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,481
I say, we...

233
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:57,751
I have an idea.

234
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:34,998
Darwin! That was a great idea!

235
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,850
Come on, Otta Benga!

236
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:10,331
Goodbye, my beautiful friend!
Have a nice swim!

237
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:20,308
Darwin, you are a genius!

238
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:21,868
Much obliged!

239
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:24,415
Where do you get these ideas?

240
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,253
What is it, my friend?

241
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:54,033
How sad. The tortures of this world
have driven the poor man mad.

242
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,874
Not true.

243
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,842
He said he has been sent by his mystic cult

244
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,011
to help us against Governor Odious
and his Spanish henchmen.

245
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:13,749
This region was once a lush forest
alive with birds and sacred trees

246
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:19,689
but Odious had them all burned down.

247
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:25,134
He also says the birds are safe
inside his belly

248
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:28,900
but we must take care
for only the fittest shall survive.

249
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:32,033
Tell him we have no use of a mystic.

250
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,380
We are on a dangerous mission.

251
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:42,813
We need to hurry to the fort
to save my twin brother.

252
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,946
He will only slow us down.

253
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:51,957
<i>Fish, señor!</i>

254
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,216
Stand aside, my friend.

255
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:32,320
Before you say kaboom,
I have this door open.

256
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,667
Forgive me, wise mystic, for my disrespect.

257
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:23,271
Undoubtedly, you have a flair
for war-mongering.

258
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:28,952
It would be my honor
if you consider joining us

259
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,487
on our quest.

260
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:35,851
We must save your brother!

261
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,169
First,

262
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:51,766
a little test.

263
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,574
You can't stop there.

264
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:58,446
I just wanna play a little game. I want you
to go outside and touch one of my toes.

265
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:02,213
No, tell me the story.
What happened with the Blue Bandit?

266
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:03,982
It won't take long.

267
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:07,218
- Just go outside and touch one of my toes.
- Okay.

268
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,589
- I'm touching your little toe.
- No!

269
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:18,830
Please don't tell me
which toe you're touching. I gotta guess.

270
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:21,838
That's the whole point of the game.
All right.

271
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:23,567
I'm touching one.

272
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,878
I'm touching one.

273
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:35,111
You're touching my big toe?

274
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:40,382
Are you telling the truth?

275
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,892
Look.

276
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:51,629
Really.

277
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,401
Oh, I got that?

278
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,236
What happened?

279
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,208
What happened with his brother?
Did he save him?

280
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:02,144
No, no, no, no. Were you telling a story?

281
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:06,216
No, no, no.
Were you telling the truth just now?

282
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:09,412
No. I was telling the truth.

283
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,648
No. You just said no,
you weren't telling the truth.

284
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,315
No, I tell you it.

285
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:16,019
- Were you telling the truth?
- Yeah.

286
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:18,324
When you just touched my toe?

287
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:23,398
- You little liar.
- No.

288
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,263
Alexandria, were you lying to me?

289
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:31,938
I touch your big toe.

290
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:35,405
We need to hurry!

291
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,172
Do you want me to finish the story?

292
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:44,314
<i>The Masked Bandit arrived
at the Chandelier Hall too late.</i>

293
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:49,753
<i>Odious had already
tortured his brother and crew</i>

294
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:51,317
<i>and hung them.</i>

295
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:14,246
All right, that's it! It's not a circus.
It's not a playground for all your...

296
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:16,684
Please! Are you listening to me?

297
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:18,847
Get out of here!

298
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,483
- You leave her alone.
- Come here, baby.

299
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,356
Get off! Goddamn!

300
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:29,399
No, no, no, sweetheart, come here,
come here. Come on.

301
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,253
Dad?

302
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,954
- Dad? Dad?
- I'm not feeling real well.

303
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:32,188
- What do you want?
- He's doing it again.

304
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,322
Will you stop that? Leave him alone!

305
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,828
- What's that?
- Food.

306
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:09,264
- Where'd you get it?
- The chapel.

307
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:16,999
I'm sorry I shouted at you.

308
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,602
I was angry.

309
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,043
No problem.

310
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,039
Are you trying to save my soul?
Are you trying to save my soul?

311
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,720
- Do you understand me?
- What?

312
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:34,917
- Did you understand what I meant?
- What you said?

313
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:37,756
I said, are you trying to save my soul?

314
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:41,023
- Giving me that.
- What mean that?

315
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:43,396
The Eucharist. It's a...

316
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:46,030
What?

317
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:49,300
The Eucharist.
The thing you gave me. It's a...

318
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,138
It saves your soul.

319
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:56,302
The thing I gave to you, what?

320
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:00,316
The little piece of bread
that you just gave me.

321
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,113
It saves your soul.

322
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:06,345
- What? What? What?
- Are you worried about me?

323
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:09,052
Saves your soul.
Do you know what "soul" means?

324
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:11,617
- No.
- It's like strength.

325
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:18,865
Why does the old man
keep his teeth in a glass at night?

326
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:25,368
It's where he keeps his strength, his spirit.

327
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:30,269
His spirit is in those teeth.

328
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:34,545
Yeah.

329
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:37,811
Oh, you're missing a little strength

330
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:41,457
right in the front of your mouth.

331
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:46,922
The chapel's in the main block, isn't it?

332
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:49,523
Yes. What happened with the Black Bandit?

333
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,202
I'm sorry.

334
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:56,503
It's okay.

335
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:03,040
They keep the medicine in the main block,
don't they?

336
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,376
Yes.

337
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:28,765
That which has been taken from me
can never be replaced.

338
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:31,966
My brother...

339
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:34,876
<i>- Why he speaks like this?
- Because he's your father.</i>

340
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:36,810
<i>But my father is dead.</i>

341
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,142
<i>What?</i>

342
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:44,684
<i>Okay, how do you want me...
How do you want him to speak?</i>

343
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,586
I think of all the joys we had.

344
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,887
<i>Normal, like you.</i>

345
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:51,553
I could've saved you, but I was weak.

346
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:57,058
My grief has gone blood-red with revenge.

347
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,199
I'm stronger now.

348
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:09,576
I will search the four corners of this Earth,
find Governor Odious and joyously kill him!

349
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:16,014
By the Blue Bandit's honor, I swear

350
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:20,217
I will annihilate him
and everything that he loves!

351
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:31,530
I will destroy him! I will destroy him!

352
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:34,867
Destroy him! I will destroy him!

353
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,510
And every Spanish thing.

354
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:45,873
<i>I thought he was Spanish.</i>

355
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:47,943
<i>No.</i>

356
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,352
<i>He was French.</i>

357
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,447
Are you with me, bandits?

358
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,909
Darwin! Which way to Governor Odious?

359
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:25,486
I tell him not to put the map with the bugs.

360
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:28,052
Are we lost?

361
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,217
<i>Sorry, Capitaine.</i>

362
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:32,392
Hey! No!

363
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:38,960
Hey! You can't eat it, it's poisonous!

364
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,310
What's he saying?

365
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,749
He says we should follow him
to greener pastures!

366
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:57,584
- What?
- He say it's greener down there.

367
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:00,714
Green? Down where?

368
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:01,883
I don't know.

369
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,120
To greener pastures!

370
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:05,685
Slow down!

371
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:10,957
The birds in his belly
crave greener pastures!

372
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:15,099
Hey! It is greener down there.

373
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,834
Greener pastures.

374
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,343
Slow down!

375
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:35,755
Please don't run!
The poison works faster if you run!

376
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:43,764
Slow down.

377
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:55,471
It's poisonous.

378
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,149
What?

379
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:02,507
He's giving us directions.

380
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:34,668
Go!

381
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:29,992
Slaves!

382
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:44,376
Odious's flag.

383
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:52,545
We must free the slaves.

384
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:10,371
Tell me, Alexandria, do you read English?

385
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:15,603
You always stop at the same part
when it's very beautiful

386
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:18,208
and interesting.

387
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:21,445
I just wanted to know
if you can read English.

388
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:22,849
Can you?

389
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:26,481
- Can you read English?
- Yeah.

390
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,185
- What's this?
- Paper.

391
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:32,057
No. What's this? This.

392
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:36,532
M- o-r-p-h...

393
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,666
Three.

394
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,568
- What's that?
- Three.

395
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:43,003
That's good.

396
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:50,002
I'm having a hard time sleeping
and I can't remember that story.

397
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:55,318
I need some pills.

398
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:59,481
I need pills in a bottle
that has this written on them.

399
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:02,719
M- o-r-p-h-i-n-three?

400
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:05,728
Yes. And it's in the main block.

401
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:11,298
In that room in the main block.

402
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,762
You understand?

403
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,401
- Ask the head nurse.
- I'm asking you as a friend.

404
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:23,935
- But it's stealing.
- No, it's not. Not if you need it.

405
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:29,315
It's no different
than stealing bread from a church.

406
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,189
- I'll ask them for you.
- No.

407
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:37,827
It's a bandit secret.

408
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:42,863
I need the pills
to finish the story. Understand?

409
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,125
- I can't get it...
- I'll do it.

410
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:48,565
Thanks.

411
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:02,181
You look beautiful.

412
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,290
Why do you put red on your cheeks?

413
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:13,554
Because it makes you look pretty

414
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,435
and healthy, too.

415
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:26,306
- Remember, back before lunch.
- I know!

416
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:29,072
Alexandria, no licking the ice today?

417
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:31,706
No. Thank you! Bye!

418
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,422
One bite maybe. But a pit of snakes?

419
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:37,141
M- o-r-p-h-i-n-three. M-o-r-p-h-i-n...

420
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:44,113
M- o-r-p-h-i-n...

421
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:18,887
Maybe you got...
I know it's important that you listen to me.

422
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,947
You've gotta think of your other children.

423
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:23,818
I'm so sorry.

424
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:27,660
You have to warn your other children
about the sounds of rattlesnakes.

425
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:32,566
This isn't a good time.
There are snake pits all over this area.

426
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:42,905
Wake up! Wake up!
You better get up or they'll chop you.

427
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:47,280
You get up! You better get up
and show these people you are sleeping.

428
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:50,787
These men will chop you if you don't get up.
Get up!

429
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:53,322
Get up. This isn't funny.

430
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:56,756
Please, let's leave this place.

431
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,840
Come on. Come on!

432
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:21,115
I do that all the time.

433
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:26,121
All you have to do is change your clothes
and hide the wet ones until they're dry.

434
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,817
You know what I do
when something frightens me?

435
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:34,761
I say the magic words.

436
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,266
Googly, googly, googly, begone.

437
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:47,669
Let's practice together.

438
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:49,371
The magic words.

439
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:53,273
Googly, googly, googly. Go away.

440
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:03,818
- Did you get what I sent you for?
- Yes.

441
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,594
- This it is.
- Yeah?

442
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:11,566
There's only three in here.

443
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:14,729
- You asked me for three.
- No, I asked you for a full bottle.

444
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:18,172
- But, you wrote...
- Was this bottle full of pills?

445
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:21,778
- Were there more pills in here?
- Yeah.

446
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:23,107
What did you do with them?

447
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,808
I throw them in toilet.

448
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,511
But I throw them away because you wrote

449
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:35,388
m- o-r-p-h-i-n-three.

450
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:40,856
Will they help you sleep?

451
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:46,135
A nap perhaps.

452
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:54,169
<i>We must free the slaves.</i>

453
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:56,235
Did they free the slaves?

454
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:15,918
Come out, Odious.

455
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:41,077
Just like a butterfly.

456
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,821
<i>Why the mask again?</i>

457
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:52,726
<i>He doesn't want to scare her.</i>

458
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:57,790
<i>She doesn't know anything about him,
but he knew everything about her.</i>

459
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:03,097
<i>The color of her eyes.</i>

460
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:05,663
<i>Brown.</i>

461
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:09,136
<i>Her favorite food.</i>

462
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:10,509
<i>Orange?</i>

463
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,673
<i>Her favorite book.</i>

464
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:13,909
<i>Bible.</i>

465
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:18,078
Boys, she's mine.

466
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,253
<i>- What about the bomb?
- What?</i>

467
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:25,589
<i>The bomb.</i>

468
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:39,498
<i>The bandits kidnapped the princess,
leaving behind her little nephew.</i>

469
00:54:46,483 --> 00:54:48,974
<i>They rode down
from the high mountain deserts</i>

470
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:50,815
<i>to a place he loved.</i>

471
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:57,351
<i>He had played as a child with his twin.</i>

472
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:02,123
<i>A palace in the middle of a lake.</i>

473
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:46,036
What's the matter with that poor fellow?

474
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:50,576
Ever since the Indian's misfortune

475
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:53,707
he took a vow
to never look at another squaw.

476
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:57,776
But a man cannot show what's in his heart
when he hides his face.

477
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:02,691
Who, may I ask, are you?

478
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:05,819
To most I am known as the Masked Bandit.

479
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:08,090
The Scourge of the Southeast?

480
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:12,458
That's the one.

481
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:20,501
But that's only when I wear the mask.

482
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:29,852
Who are you?

483
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,358
Nurse Evelyn.

484
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:44,299
Once I was Lady Evelyn Everest Everhardt,
and now I am simply called...

485
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:47,292
- Sister Evelyn.
- She is not a sister.

486
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:50,464
Bless you. No. What? Yes, she is.

487
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:54,307
She doesn't have brothers and sisters.

488
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:58,337
No, she's a nun, like these nuns out here.

489
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:05,419
And she turned from the Masked Bandit,
and she said...

490
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:08,514
- May I be frank with you?
- Of course.

491
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:12,327
Although I've dedicated my life
to God and goodness

492
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:16,798
I secretly love throwing oranges
at our priest.

493
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:19,357
Take two turns to the left
and go to the bathroom.

494
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,835
No, you read my note.

495
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:23,270
What are you talking about?
Go to the bathroom.

496
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:25,136
No.

497
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:27,574
How do you know
about the priest and the orange?

498
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:30,112
Everybody knows
you like throwing oranges at the priest.

499
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:34,344
Even the priest knows, but I didn't
find that out from your gibberish message.

500
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:36,180
It's not gibberish.

501
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:07,147
She wants to ask you
how much days I have to stay here.

502
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:10,050
Well, I want you to stay here
until you get better.

503
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:15,888
Her cast will come off in a few days

504
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:20,123
but I'd like her to stay here
until she's completely recovered.

505
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:32,002
She wants to say
that we are spend here too much times

506
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:33,906
and we have to leave the city.

507
00:58:33,977 --> 00:58:38,209
No, well, you just tell her
that you shouldn't be working in the groves.

508
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:40,010
That at your age it's dangerous

509
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:43,052
and you'll spend
the rest of your days picking fruit.

510
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,747
And then she'll fall. She surely will fall.

511
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,546
Thank you.

512
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:17,714
- What did she say?
- She says okay.

513
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:20,555
- Really?
- Really.

514
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:22,648
Alexandria, she asked me something,
didn't she?

515
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,625
No, that how we speak.

516
00:59:26,548 --> 00:59:28,175
- You sure?
- Sure.

517
00:59:46,034 --> 00:59:51,267
Beautiful machina. Beautiful machina.

518
01:00:07,221 --> 01:00:11,590
Beautiful machina. Beautiful machina.

519
01:00:14,195 --> 01:00:18,393
Beautiful machina. Beautiful machina.

520
01:00:18,466 --> 01:00:20,798
It's a very generous offer.

521
01:00:20,868 --> 01:00:25,828
If you look over here at the number,
it's more money than I actually make a year.

522
01:00:25,907 --> 01:00:27,568
I want to add something to it.

523
01:00:27,642 --> 01:00:29,576
Don't start adding stuff to this.

524
01:00:29,644 --> 01:00:33,307
You know, the studio's got
a building full of lawyers.

525
01:00:33,381 --> 01:00:36,441
Jumping, falling, crashing.

526
01:00:36,517 --> 01:00:39,077
I mean, cowhands are getting all the glory.

527
01:00:40,388 --> 01:00:43,016
Whose idea was it anyway?

528
01:00:43,091 --> 01:00:45,889
Jumping onto a horse from a train bridge?

529
01:00:48,996 --> 01:00:52,363
Add the screening to the contract
and I'll sign it.

530
01:00:52,433 --> 01:00:54,628
What happens to the money if I die?

531
01:00:54,702 --> 01:00:59,035
Roy, you need to get off this suicide thing.

532
01:01:00,874 --> 01:01:03,775
Let the doctors finish what they started.

533
01:01:05,378 --> 01:01:07,403
Problem is not his back.

534
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:10,913
It's a broken heart.

535
01:01:12,819 --> 01:01:14,582
He needs to get over her.

536
01:01:14,654 --> 01:01:17,748
I mean, he's not the first guy to lose a girl.

537
01:01:19,493 --> 01:01:20,824
I'm sorry.

538
01:01:22,829 --> 01:01:24,797
You are someone famous.

539
01:01:26,967 --> 01:01:28,332
So they tell me.

540
01:01:28,401 --> 01:01:29,732
Hey, kid!

541
01:01:42,315 --> 01:01:44,078
I made this for you.

542
01:01:51,658 --> 01:01:53,182
Who's in the mask?

543
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:56,127
You in the wheelchair.

544
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,829
It's beautiful.

545
01:02:03,537 --> 01:02:05,402
I'll keep it forever.

546
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:07,906
I hope I never get better.

547
01:02:09,942 --> 01:02:14,879
- Why?
- Because I want to stay here with you.

548
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:26,284
- Hey, this came for you today.
- Really?

549
01:02:28,561 --> 01:02:31,428
- You like chocolate?
- I like it.

550
01:02:35,167 --> 01:02:38,625
- Do you want me to finish the story?
- Yes.

551
01:02:41,073 --> 01:02:43,837
- I need a favor.
- What kind of favor?

552
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:46,243
You know our friend Walt?

553
01:02:46,312 --> 01:02:49,406
- He's not my friend.
- He's not my friend either.

554
01:02:49,481 --> 01:02:55,044
I retrieved this key from him
because I think he's been stealing my pills.

555
01:02:56,388 --> 01:02:59,289
I think he's got them in his cabinet there.

556
01:02:59,925 --> 01:03:02,917
I want you to go check
and see if he's got them.

557
01:03:02,995 --> 01:03:05,486
Why? I got you the bottle.

558
01:03:06,432 --> 01:03:09,731
There weren't enough in there
for me to go to sleep.

559
01:03:14,139 --> 01:03:16,801
Come on. Be a good bandit.

560
01:03:20,145 --> 01:03:22,272
I don't want to be a bandit.

561
01:03:24,048 --> 01:03:25,572
That's too bad.

562
01:03:26,918 --> 01:03:32,049
<i>Because Odious's castle
is surrounded by a big blue city.</i>

563
01:03:35,293 --> 01:03:39,559
<i>And that's where the bandits are headed
for their final encounter.</i>

564
01:03:43,835 --> 01:03:46,429
It's the best part of the story,
and since you're leaving soon

565
01:03:46,504 --> 01:03:50,770
I'd hate for you to spend your whole life
wondering how it turned out.

566
01:03:54,846 --> 01:03:57,371
- What's in the drawer?
- Stuff.

567
01:03:57,448 --> 01:04:01,043
- What kind of stuff?
- Stuff Walt's been stealing from me.

568
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,049
What?

569
01:04:04,122 --> 01:04:06,113
I won't know until you go look.

570
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:09,455
- Promise you'll finish the story?
- Yeah.

571
01:04:34,552 --> 01:04:36,213
It's that brown bottle.

572
01:04:38,056 --> 01:04:40,853
- This one?
- That's the one.

573
01:04:42,092 --> 01:04:44,253
I think he stole it from me.

574
01:04:50,901 --> 01:04:52,163
That's mine.

575
01:04:54,538 --> 01:04:56,665
<i>Where did we leave off?</i>

576
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:58,640
<i>They were telling secrets each other.</i>

577
01:04:58,709 --> 01:05:01,371
I'm looking for the man
who murdered my father.

578
01:05:02,879 --> 01:05:03,903
<i>The Black Bandit said.</i>

579
01:05:03,981 --> 01:05:05,972
My brother, the Blue Masked Bandit...

580
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:09,184
<i>- He said.
... tried to avenge our father's death.</i>

581
01:05:09,252 --> 01:05:13,985
<i>I've been on a quest for revenge.</i>

582
01:05:14,057 --> 01:05:15,217
Tortured and hung.

583
01:05:15,292 --> 01:05:20,594
<i>He told her everything about his life
except for the name of Governor Odious.</i>

584
01:05:20,897 --> 01:05:22,592
You need to leave.

585
01:05:31,441 --> 01:05:32,965
<i>You should go.</i>

586
01:05:33,577 --> 01:05:36,410
<i>But you promised you'll tell me the story.</i>

587
01:05:41,351 --> 01:05:43,876
You've captivated my heart, Evelyn.

588
01:05:46,023 --> 01:05:49,220
That's why
I can no longer keep you in captivity.

589
01:05:50,727 --> 01:05:52,956
I've fallen in love with you.

590
01:05:54,730 --> 01:05:57,028
But I am consumed with revenge.

591
01:05:59,902 --> 01:06:02,462
I'm not a man who can be loved.

592
01:06:03,539 --> 01:06:05,939
When I fall asleep, you gotta go.

593
01:06:09,378 --> 01:06:11,608
And don't come back tomorrow.

594
01:06:13,115 --> 01:06:14,241
Okay.

595
01:06:18,821 --> 01:06:20,186
Thank you.

596
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:29,930
- I'm sorry about this.
- Why?

597
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:35,937
I'm sorry.

598
01:06:38,641 --> 01:06:39,835
Why?

599
01:06:42,445 --> 01:06:44,970
I don't want you to see me like this.

600
01:06:49,952 --> 01:06:52,284
You think you took me captive?

601
01:06:56,926 --> 01:06:59,690
In fact, you're my savior.

602
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,435
I was like a bird in a golden cage.

603
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:15,371
By freeing me, you captured my heart.

604
01:07:25,487 --> 01:07:27,148
<i>Make them kiss.</i>

605
01:07:27,222 --> 01:07:29,782
<i>No, I don't want to make them kiss.</i>

606
01:07:31,593 --> 01:07:32,753
<i>Why?</i>

607
01:07:33,461 --> 01:07:36,123
<i>Because what they're about to find out.</i>

608
01:07:42,403 --> 01:07:44,963
She should have not come with us.

609
01:07:47,375 --> 01:07:50,640
- Why?
- It is too dangerous.

610
01:07:50,712 --> 01:07:55,206
If we are captured,
Governor Odious shall surely kill her.

611
01:07:57,185 --> 01:07:59,153
You mentioned Odious?

612
01:08:00,655 --> 01:08:02,418
He is my sworn enemy.

613
01:08:03,258 --> 01:08:04,748
And my fiancé.

614
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,144
No.

615
01:08:37,391 --> 01:08:39,859
I want to look at you until I die.

616
01:08:43,330 --> 01:08:46,231
What a mystery this world.

617
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:48,768
One day you love them

618
01:08:48,835 --> 01:08:52,703
and the next day
you want to kill them a thousand times over.

619
01:08:56,410 --> 01:08:58,037
God forgive him.

620
01:09:05,552 --> 01:09:07,679
I'm glad I never kissed you.

621
01:09:14,528 --> 01:09:16,018
<i>She can't die.</i>

622
01:09:20,434 --> 01:09:22,095
She's still alive!

623
01:09:29,343 --> 01:09:32,176
The solid gold locket stopped the bullet.

624
01:09:41,187 --> 01:09:44,054
"My dearest daughter,

625
01:09:44,123 --> 01:09:49,686
"never marry for money, fame,
power or security.

626
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:54,996
"Always follow your heart.

627
01:09:55,067 --> 01:09:56,762
"Your ever-loving father. "

628
01:09:56,836 --> 01:09:59,600
It says all that on that little locket?

629
01:10:02,675 --> 01:10:04,609
I've never been able to open it.

630
01:10:04,677 --> 01:10:08,238
No one's been able to open it.
You're the first.

631
01:10:12,251 --> 01:10:16,551
And he knew that she was the woman
he was supposed to love.

632
01:10:16,622 --> 01:10:20,183
Please. Please. Now they can kiss-kiss?

633
01:10:21,527 --> 01:10:22,619
Yes.

634
01:10:25,431 --> 01:10:27,456
But first, marriage.

635
01:10:32,538 --> 01:10:34,529
And then they can kiss.

636
01:10:54,359 --> 01:10:55,656
The ring.

637
01:11:20,852 --> 01:11:23,821
The Mystic spies danger in your palm.

638
01:11:23,888 --> 01:11:27,153
You've taken too many pills. Death is near.

639
01:11:29,194 --> 01:11:30,456
Danger?

640
01:11:30,528 --> 01:11:32,860
Suicide is not the answer.

641
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:38,526
He says he also knows of a secret chant.

642
01:11:38,603 --> 01:11:40,230
Whenever we're in trouble...

643
01:11:42,107 --> 01:11:45,304
Something about "googly-googly?"

644
01:11:47,112 --> 01:11:50,411
He says if you fall asleep,
you will never wake up.

645
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:18,501
<i>The Mystic was right.</i>

646
01:12:18,575 --> 01:12:21,408
<i>The stony-faced priest had betrayed them.</i>

647
01:13:27,577 --> 01:13:29,841
<i>And then they were saved?</i>

648
01:13:29,912 --> 01:13:30,970
<i>No.</i>

649
01:13:36,686 --> 01:13:39,211
<i>There was no one left to save them.</i>

650
01:13:51,601 --> 01:13:52,829
Wallace?

651
01:13:54,737 --> 01:13:58,264
Wallace, is that you? Wallace?

652
01:13:58,341 --> 01:13:59,831
No, it's me.

653
01:14:05,982 --> 01:14:08,610
No wonder the bag was so heavy.

654
01:14:26,269 --> 01:14:27,463
Shoot!

655
01:14:33,342 --> 01:14:35,707
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot them, Daddy!

656
01:14:37,746 --> 01:14:39,213
Shoot them!

657
01:14:44,419 --> 01:14:47,479
Daddy, don't you recognize me?

658
01:14:47,556 --> 01:14:49,285
Don't you? It's me!

659
01:14:51,993 --> 01:14:53,927
Don't you recognize me?

660
01:14:58,333 --> 01:15:01,268
- Who are you?
- It's me, Da-da.

661
01:15:01,336 --> 01:15:03,327
- Who?
- Me!

662
01:15:03,405 --> 01:15:06,272
- My daughter?
- Yes! You recognize me.

663
01:15:07,642 --> 01:15:11,169
Yeah. My daughter
from a previous marriage.

664
01:15:11,246 --> 01:15:12,679
Yes.

665
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:18,876
I didn't recognize you
because you have teeth.

666
01:15:22,023 --> 01:15:24,184
You must be stronger now.

667
01:15:26,995 --> 01:15:29,293
Not the time to sleep now.

668
01:15:31,166 --> 01:15:33,066
Not the time to sleep.

669
01:15:37,706 --> 01:15:39,606
It's not time to sleep.

670
01:16:00,594 --> 01:16:01,856
Wake up.

671
01:16:10,971 --> 01:16:12,905
Wake up. It's not time to sleep now.

672
01:16:17,111 --> 01:16:18,339
Wake up.

673
01:16:20,214 --> 01:16:21,704
Don't pretend to sleep.

674
01:16:23,017 --> 01:16:25,485
Wake up. Laugh, laugh.

675
01:16:31,125 --> 01:16:32,990
Not the time to sleep.

676
01:17:31,684 --> 01:17:36,519
<i>Americana Exotica.</i>

677
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:43,328
Does Dr. Snider know about this?

678
01:17:53,172 --> 01:17:56,767
He was under observation,
but I thought he was getting better.

679
01:17:56,843 --> 01:17:57,935
Hey!

680
01:17:58,945 --> 01:18:02,142
Alexandria, go inside! Go on!

681
01:18:02,215 --> 01:18:04,877
All right, carry on. Sorry about that.

682
01:18:23,902 --> 01:18:26,564
Roy, wake up. Wake up.

683
01:18:27,739 --> 01:18:29,570
Roy, wake up.

684
01:18:32,244 --> 01:18:35,839
They're going to cut you up.
Gonna chop you up. Wake up.

685
01:18:35,914 --> 01:18:38,246
- Go on! Shoo!
- Wake up.

686
01:18:43,054 --> 01:18:44,043
Oh, no, no, no.

687
01:18:44,122 --> 01:18:47,091
He was his usual self, you know,
smiling away, playing with his teeth.

688
01:18:47,159 --> 01:18:49,855
I just don't feel very well, Doc.

689
01:18:49,928 --> 01:18:53,125
I don't know
what the hell's wrong with me. Cough.

690
01:18:54,599 --> 01:18:56,726
What, am I going delirious
from the medication?

691
01:18:56,802 --> 01:18:59,032
I don't know what the hell...

692
01:19:03,942 --> 01:19:05,000
Roy!

693
01:19:06,244 --> 01:19:10,704
Roy, I thought you were dead.

694
01:19:10,782 --> 01:19:14,582
Saw two men,
and they were carrying the body away.

695
01:19:14,653 --> 01:19:17,554
And then I tried to pinch your toe.

696
01:19:21,593 --> 01:19:23,686
I run after you,

697
01:19:23,762 --> 01:19:29,758
and after that one of the doctors told me,
"Shoo!" and I had to go away.

698
01:19:29,835 --> 01:19:33,497
I'm sorry. I promise, but you...

699
01:19:39,076 --> 01:19:42,045
- I bring you more medicine if you want.
- Sugar.

700
01:19:42,112 --> 01:19:44,342
- I promise...
- They're giving him sugar.

701
01:19:44,415 --> 01:19:45,905
Come here!

702
01:19:46,817 --> 01:19:51,379
Oh, well, that's great, you're awake.
I brought your x-rays...

703
01:19:51,455 --> 01:19:53,719
- Hey, you wanna take a look...
- Doc, the old man's dead and you're...

704
01:19:53,791 --> 01:19:55,452
- Hey. Roy!
- That's it!

705
01:19:56,727 --> 01:19:58,888
- Will you shut up, already?
- You shut up!

706
01:19:58,963 --> 01:20:02,330
Get out of here! You're not really sick, Walt!
They're feeding you sugar!

707
01:20:02,399 --> 01:20:04,594
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
- I've had enough of you!

708
01:20:04,668 --> 01:20:05,692
Nurse!

709
01:20:05,769 --> 01:20:07,430
What do you mean, they're giving me sugar?

710
01:20:07,504 --> 01:20:09,836
- Here you go, Doctor.
- She's wet herself.

711
01:20:09,907 --> 01:20:11,704
Get her out of here.

712
01:20:14,445 --> 01:20:16,811
Go back to your room. Orderlies!

713
01:21:11,601 --> 01:21:13,626
You should be in bed, Alexandria.

714
01:21:13,703 --> 01:21:16,194
There's more fires in the field.

715
01:21:19,842 --> 01:21:23,972
It's kerosene.
The kerosene stops the fruit from freezing.

716
01:21:24,047 --> 01:21:27,710
No, it's Mystic.

717
01:21:27,784 --> 01:21:30,753
He's coming out of that tree to help Roy.

718
01:21:32,722 --> 01:21:36,590
I think it's bedtime, young lady.
No more time for funny talk.

719
01:21:37,694 --> 01:21:39,161
Into bed now.

720
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:41,560
And maybe one day

721
01:21:41,631 --> 01:21:45,533
you can take me downstairs
and introduce me to your friend Roy.

722
01:21:46,602 --> 01:21:49,594
We go downstairs and say good night?

723
01:21:49,672 --> 01:21:52,436
No. He's not allowed any visitors.

724
01:21:53,509 --> 01:21:56,171
Your friend, Roy, needs to rest.

725
01:21:56,245 --> 01:22:00,476
He's very sad. He's lost his girlfriend.
He needs to sleep.

726
01:22:00,549 --> 01:22:04,986
But he can't. He needs medicine to sleep,
but he doesn't have any.

727
01:22:05,053 --> 01:22:06,281
That's the problem.

728
01:22:06,355 --> 01:22:09,916
I'm sure
they're taking very good care of him.

729
01:22:11,026 --> 01:22:12,994
Now, it's time for bed.

730
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:16,820
Little girls need to go to sleep, too.

731
01:22:16,898 --> 01:22:19,594
- I'm not little. I am five.
- Of course.

732
01:22:20,502 --> 01:22:21,867
I forgot.

733
01:23:20,161 --> 01:23:29,800
Googly, googly, googly, go away.
Googly, googly, googly, go away.

734
01:23:34,075 --> 01:23:39,138
Googly, googly. Go away.
Googly, googly, googly. Go away.

735
01:23:56,864 --> 01:24:00,527
Googly, googly. Go away.

736
01:24:00,601 --> 01:24:04,833
Googly, googly.
Googly, googly, googly, go away.

737
01:24:28,863 --> 01:24:33,162
<i>Papa, they steal our horse.</i>

738
01:24:36,035 --> 01:24:40,028
<i>Papa, they steal our horse.</i>

739
01:24:41,174 --> 01:24:42,402
<i>Papa,</i>

740
01:24:46,412 --> 01:24:48,642
<i>they steal our horse.</i>

741
01:24:48,715 --> 01:24:52,674
<i>Papa, angry people burn our home.</i>

742
01:24:52,752 --> 01:24:55,949
<i>They burn our house. Don't go outside.</i>

743
01:24:56,022 --> 01:24:57,046
Thieves.

744
01:24:58,091 --> 01:25:00,252
<i>Angry people kill.</i>

745
01:25:01,394 --> 01:25:02,884
Thieves!

746
01:25:35,195 --> 01:25:36,662
<i>The x-ray seems fine.</i>

747
01:25:55,314 --> 01:25:58,044
<i>- Mommy!
- Were you taking medicine to Roy?</i>

748
01:26:00,385 --> 01:26:04,719
<i>That is your responsibility
and this is how you treat it.</i>

749
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:07,850
<i>To get better, you gotta have the will</i>

750
01:26:09,595 --> 01:26:11,586
and your own desire to live.

751
01:26:49,434 --> 01:26:51,629
I fell again.

752
01:26:51,703 --> 01:26:54,399
I heard. Everybody's heard.

753
01:26:56,508 --> 01:26:58,032
You're famous.

754
01:27:03,047 --> 01:27:04,708
Are they angry?

755
01:27:04,782 --> 01:27:06,079
Yeah,

756
01:27:08,686 --> 01:27:10,017
but not at you.

757
01:27:10,087 --> 01:27:14,786
I try to take more pills, but I fell.
It was the wrong thing, and...

758
01:27:14,859 --> 01:27:19,296
- What?
- I put my foot on it when I went up

759
01:27:19,363 --> 01:27:25,996
and later on the thing made me go like that
and I fell.

760
01:27:33,577 --> 01:27:36,842
I didn't tell anybody about our secret.

761
01:27:39,116 --> 01:27:42,574
Even when they tortured me with needles.

762
01:27:45,056 --> 01:27:47,354
Is that a pirate's flag?

763
01:27:49,427 --> 01:27:51,224
Is that yes or no?

764
01:27:52,463 --> 01:27:54,192
Tell me the story.

765
01:27:54,965 --> 01:27:57,058
I should go. You need your rest.

766
01:27:57,134 --> 01:27:58,726
But I want to talk.

767
01:27:58,803 --> 01:28:01,067
- I know you do.
- You promised.

768
01:28:02,506 --> 01:28:06,306
The story was just a trick
to get you to do something for me.

769
01:28:06,377 --> 01:28:08,345
- What?
- I was...

770
01:28:10,414 --> 01:28:12,813
But I need the story.

771
01:28:14,718 --> 01:28:17,016
You should ask someone else.

772
01:28:18,321 --> 01:28:20,881
There's no happy ending with me.

773
01:28:23,893 --> 01:28:25,451
I still want to know.

774
01:28:27,630 --> 01:28:29,791
Ask your friend, Nurse Evelyn,
she'll tell it better than I will.

775
01:28:29,866 --> 01:28:32,164
I don't want her in the story!

776
01:28:32,235 --> 01:28:33,634
She's okay.

777
01:28:35,405 --> 01:28:38,772
Oh, she doesn't really
love Governor Odious.

778
01:28:39,576 --> 01:28:43,068
She's just pretending.

779
01:28:43,146 --> 01:28:46,479
I saw her with one of the hospital men.

780
01:28:46,549 --> 01:28:49,109
She was just pretending to love you.

781
01:28:53,723 --> 01:28:55,850
Just like your girlfriend.

782
01:28:55,925 --> 01:28:57,119
I see.

783
01:29:01,631 --> 01:29:04,862
Governor Odious with Nurse Evelyn!

784
01:29:08,505 --> 01:29:09,972
She's right.

785
01:29:23,586 --> 01:29:25,076
She's right!

786
01:29:35,230 --> 01:29:37,460
We don't need her.

787
01:29:37,533 --> 01:29:39,296
She can't be trusted.

788
01:29:41,537 --> 01:29:46,167
You give them your heart,
but all they really want is your wallet.

789
01:29:47,743 --> 01:29:51,372
Sooner or later she's gonna leave him
for a richer man.

790
01:29:51,447 --> 01:29:52,744
Is a trap.

791
01:29:52,815 --> 01:29:56,148
<i>- I understand.
- I don't like it.</i>

792
01:29:56,218 --> 01:29:58,243
<i>Thank you for telling me.</i>

793
01:30:00,556 --> 01:30:03,150
Is a suicide. For all of us.

794
01:30:05,527 --> 01:30:07,085
We're going.

795
01:30:11,867 --> 01:30:15,701
Hey, Indian, what means suicide?

796
01:31:10,758 --> 01:31:12,783
Wallace? Wallace!

797
01:31:17,999 --> 01:31:19,296
Wallace!

798
01:31:19,967 --> 01:31:22,401
Wallace, what are you doing?

799
01:31:22,470 --> 01:31:24,995
Wallace, please will you come down?

800
01:31:26,541 --> 01:31:29,442
Please, this really isn't the time.

801
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:31,978
Wallace, please!
Wallace, will you come down?

802
01:31:34,815 --> 01:31:36,077
Wallace!

803
01:31:42,890 --> 01:31:44,118
Wallace!

804
01:31:48,529 --> 01:31:50,554
Wallace, what did you do?

805
01:31:59,906 --> 01:32:02,204
<i>Americana Exotica!</i>

806
01:32:04,744 --> 01:32:06,609
<i>Americana Exotica!</i>

807
01:32:07,747 --> 01:32:09,408
It's beautiful!

808
01:32:19,993 --> 01:32:22,587
<i>Does he really died?</i>

809
01:32:34,708 --> 01:32:36,073
Let's go!

810
01:32:37,210 --> 01:32:38,507
I'm all washed-up!

811
01:32:38,578 --> 01:32:41,479
- Uncle Darwin, there's angry people.
- Don't leave me, my friend.

812
01:32:41,548 --> 01:32:44,517
I'll tell everyone they were your idea.

813
01:32:45,385 --> 01:32:48,081
They're going to find out I'm a fraud!

814
01:32:51,958 --> 01:32:54,051
Go on! Shoot, you animals!

815
01:32:56,963 --> 01:32:59,693
They'll pay you well for Darwin's hide.

816
01:33:12,411 --> 01:33:14,003
<i>He died, too.</i>

817
01:33:15,614 --> 01:33:17,138
<i>And Wallace, too?</i>

818
01:33:18,617 --> 01:33:20,175
Did he really died?

819
01:33:20,252 --> 01:33:23,881
Yeah, and in Wallace's case, happily so.

820
01:33:26,191 --> 01:33:27,920
It was the natural order of things.

821
01:33:38,504 --> 01:33:40,301
<i>All things must die.</i>

822
01:33:52,518 --> 01:33:53,951
Damn it all!

823
01:34:18,911 --> 01:34:21,573
Back! Get back!

824
01:35:03,221 --> 01:35:04,586
Kaboom.

825
01:35:39,422 --> 01:35:41,583
If you want something done...

826
01:35:41,658 --> 01:35:43,216
Get down there!

827
01:35:43,293 --> 01:35:45,124
...you have to do it yourself.

828
01:35:45,195 --> 01:35:47,527
Get down there, you animals!

829
01:35:47,597 --> 01:35:49,497
And bring them up here!

830
01:35:57,340 --> 01:36:00,969
<i>I don't like this! I don't like this story.</i>

831
01:36:02,846 --> 01:36:04,837
Why are we running away?

832
01:36:15,325 --> 01:36:18,658
<i>Why did Luigi kill himself?</i>

833
01:36:18,728 --> 01:36:21,663
<i>Why did not he come with us?</i>

834
01:36:21,731 --> 01:36:23,528
<i>And live as half a man?</i>

835
01:36:26,169 --> 01:36:28,137
He couldn't do that.

836
01:36:28,205 --> 01:36:29,797
He gave up.

837
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:33,632
It's not very satisfying, is it?

838
01:36:33,710 --> 01:36:35,803
He didn't think so either.

839
01:36:45,488 --> 01:36:47,251
Please, the Mystic.

840
01:36:47,324 --> 01:36:50,657
Why? Why are they killing the Mystic?

841
01:36:53,129 --> 01:36:55,096
We need to go help him.

842
01:37:00,970 --> 01:37:02,301
Mystic!

843
01:37:02,371 --> 01:37:04,839
- Hey!
- Mystic!

844
01:37:04,907 --> 01:37:08,934
Googly, googly, googly, googly,
googly, googly.

845
01:37:49,652 --> 01:37:52,280
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

846
01:37:54,823 --> 01:37:56,347
I'm sorry!

847
01:37:59,628 --> 01:38:01,152
I'm sorry!

848
01:38:07,369 --> 01:38:08,801
I'm sorry.

849
01:38:10,872 --> 01:38:13,807
Googly, googly, googly!

850
01:38:21,349 --> 01:38:22,680
It's okay.

851
01:39:16,004 --> 01:39:17,369
Indian!

852
01:39:24,644 --> 01:39:25,770
Up!

853
01:39:25,846 --> 01:39:27,040
Help!

854
01:39:43,096 --> 01:39:45,826
No, no, no, no, no.

855
01:39:45,899 --> 01:39:47,491
No, no, no, no!

856
01:39:54,908 --> 01:39:57,206
Why are you killing everybody?

857
01:39:59,746 --> 01:40:02,306
Why are you making everybody die?

858
01:40:02,382 --> 01:40:04,043
It's my story.

859
01:40:04,117 --> 01:40:05,448
Mine too.

860
01:40:09,389 --> 01:40:11,050
<i>Bring them up here!</i>

861
01:40:13,593 --> 01:40:15,652
Alive!

862
01:40:15,729 --> 01:40:17,162
We are here.

863
01:40:20,834 --> 01:40:22,165
Alive.

864
01:40:25,672 --> 01:40:26,866
Roy!

865
01:40:28,542 --> 01:40:30,737
<i>Don't look at her.</i>

866
01:40:30,811 --> 01:40:34,008
<i>- She is also with Odious.
- Quiet.</i>

867
01:40:36,316 --> 01:40:39,807
<i>- Just like your girlfriend.
- Shut up.</i>

868
01:40:39,885 --> 01:40:41,580
No!

869
01:40:41,654 --> 01:40:45,283
<i>Your girlfriend came with Odious
to see you...</i>

870
01:40:45,357 --> 01:40:47,222
<i>The bandit entered Odious's garden...</i>

871
01:40:47,293 --> 01:40:50,285
<i>But she stood in the car and she...</i>

872
01:40:50,362 --> 01:40:54,355
<i>- But Odious was nowhere to be seen.
- And Odious...</i>

873
01:40:54,433 --> 01:40:59,234
As the bandit ran past Odious' hiding place,
Odious cracked him in the nose!

874
01:41:04,110 --> 01:41:06,874
<i>No, but wait a little. Wait, please!</i>

875
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:17,780
<i>So he sank to the bottom of the pool.</i>

876
01:41:19,158 --> 01:41:21,285
<i>He didn't even try to swim.</i>

877
01:41:21,961 --> 01:41:25,158
- You are making this up.
- No, I'm not.

878
01:41:26,398 --> 01:41:28,525
And he started to sink and he was dying.

879
01:41:30,336 --> 01:41:31,826
<i>Let him live.</i>

880
01:41:33,739 --> 01:41:35,070
Get up!

881
01:41:35,141 --> 01:41:37,132
Roy, get up and fight!

882
01:41:37,943 --> 01:41:39,205
Get up!

883
01:41:41,380 --> 01:41:44,907
Oh, what a shame! Look, God damn it!

884
01:41:44,984 --> 01:41:46,246
Get up!

885
01:41:48,087 --> 01:41:50,578
Look at him! Look at him!

886
01:41:50,656 --> 01:41:51,679
Get up!

887
01:41:51,756 --> 01:41:54,816
- I want you to see how pathetic he really is.
- I can't get up!

888
01:41:54,893 --> 01:41:56,622
- Get up!
- I can't get up!

889
01:41:56,694 --> 01:41:58,719
- For God's sake, the water's only waist high.
- Get up, Daddy!

890
01:41:58,796 --> 01:41:59,922
I'm not your father.

891
01:41:59,998 --> 01:42:03,832
How pathetic! Look at him!
He's a drug addict!

892
01:42:03,902 --> 01:42:06,097
Your father is a coward.

893
01:42:06,171 --> 01:42:08,435
A useless good-for-nothing!

894
01:42:08,506 --> 01:42:10,030
Dad, get up!

895
01:42:10,108 --> 01:42:11,837
He can't win!

896
01:42:11,910 --> 01:42:14,572
That's because
our Masked Bandit's a coward!

897
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:17,940
Yeah, he never took an oath.

898
01:42:18,950 --> 01:42:21,942
- A fake, he's a liar and a coward.
- You're lying!

899
01:42:22,020 --> 01:42:24,716
<i>No. He had his fingers crossed.</i>

900
01:42:26,057 --> 01:42:27,081
He has to die.

901
01:42:28,059 --> 01:42:29,788
<i>I don't believe you.</i>

902
01:42:32,964 --> 01:42:34,431
<i>He was dying.</i>

903
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:36,831
<i>Don't kill him.</i>

904
01:42:38,002 --> 01:42:41,802
<i>- I'll bring you more pills if you want.
- Dad, get up!</i>

905
01:42:41,873 --> 01:42:44,865
- Don't kill him.
- There's nothing left for him.

906
01:42:44,943 --> 01:42:46,103
His daughter.

907
01:42:46,177 --> 01:42:48,407
He wasn't her father, either.

908
01:42:49,180 --> 01:42:50,841
She loves him.

909
01:42:52,283 --> 01:42:55,719
She'll survive. She's young.

910
01:42:55,787 --> 01:42:57,846
I don't want you to die.

911
01:43:08,465 --> 01:43:10,126
Don't kill him.

912
01:43:20,077 --> 01:43:21,567
Let him live.

913
01:43:25,349 --> 01:43:26,839
Let him live.

914
01:43:27,784 --> 01:43:29,308
<i>Don't kill him.</i>

915
01:43:40,731 --> 01:43:44,861
Promise? And don't cross your fingers.

916
01:43:44,935 --> 01:43:46,562
I promise.

917
01:43:47,137 --> 01:43:48,866
Show me your hands.

918
01:43:52,843 --> 01:43:53,867
See?

919
01:44:01,318 --> 01:44:03,115
<i>No more fighting.</i>

920
01:44:05,055 --> 01:44:08,821
<i>He needs to go to his daughter. It's okay.</i>

921
01:44:08,892 --> 01:44:11,759
It's okay. It's all right. It's over now.

922
01:44:14,798 --> 01:44:16,390
Give me a kiss.

923
01:44:35,885 --> 01:44:37,318
Roy,

924
01:44:38,187 --> 01:44:42,647
you do realize it was all a test
to see if you truly loved me, don't you?

925
01:44:54,570 --> 01:44:57,334
We're finally free to follow our hearts.

926
01:45:04,947 --> 01:45:06,437
By all means.

927
01:45:10,553 --> 01:45:12,248
Follow your heart.

928
01:45:18,627 --> 01:45:20,720
I'm not feeling very well.

929
01:45:34,876 --> 01:45:36,844
We're a strange pair, aren't we?

930
01:45:52,394 --> 01:45:54,885
Action, action, action, action.

931
01:46:57,324 --> 01:46:59,792
So, this is the kind of trash
we're gonna be making now.

932
01:46:59,860 --> 01:47:04,388
People jumping off buildings,
bridges, horses.

933
01:47:37,464 --> 01:47:39,523
Did I just miss something?

934
01:47:41,702 --> 01:47:43,397
That was it?

935
01:47:43,470 --> 01:47:45,438
That was his big stunt?

936
01:47:46,173 --> 01:47:48,733
He didn't even use that horse thing.

937
01:48:37,823 --> 01:48:42,817
<i>I put old man's teeth there
because I think that</i>

938
01:48:42,895 --> 01:48:48,026
<i>the Mystic comes out of the tree
and it will grow a special orange tree.</i>

939
01:48:48,100 --> 01:48:50,500
Alexandria! Alexandria!

940
01:48:55,508 --> 01:49:00,502
<i>And we'll have oranges inside with teeths,
with teeth inside.</i>

941
01:49:16,095 --> 01:49:20,497
<i>When I get out from the hospital,
I miss Roy very much.</i>

942
01:49:22,067 --> 01:49:25,969
<i>My mother told me that he plays in pictures</i>

943
01:49:26,037 --> 01:49:29,473
<i>and he does things
that the other actors cannot do</i>

944
01:49:29,541 --> 01:49:32,442
<i>like falling and hitting</i>

945
01:49:34,946 --> 01:49:38,211
<i>and when they climb on something,
when they...</i>

946
01:49:40,352 --> 01:49:44,755
<i>I didn't believe my mother,
but then I saw him.</i>

947
01:49:53,298 --> 01:49:58,326
<i>I watch the picture again
and again and again</i>

948
01:49:58,403 --> 01:50:02,066
<i>and to make sure that was Roy,
and was Roy!</i>

949
01:50:05,510 --> 01:50:09,640
<i>And then, I like the action
from all the pictures</i>

950
01:50:09,714 --> 01:50:16,347
<i>because I know that Roy is making
all the falling and hitting and climbing</i>

951
01:50:16,421 --> 01:50:17,945
<i>and he was on the stairs</i>

952
01:50:18,023 --> 01:50:21,720
<i>and he was going up and down
and up and down.</i>

953
01:50:21,793 --> 01:50:27,891
<i>And he was falling from the train
and he was taking the car...</i>

954
01:51:00,297 --> 01:51:03,357
<i>And he was falling from the bicycle
and from a big house.</i>

955
01:51:03,434 --> 01:51:04,526
<i>It was Wallace!</i>

956
01:51:04,601 --> 01:51:06,193
<i>He was falling with the rope</i>

957
01:51:06,270 --> 01:51:08,795
