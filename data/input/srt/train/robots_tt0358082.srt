1
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,699
- There you go.
- Thanks.

2
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,892
I'm gonna be a dad!

3
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,172
I just talked to my wife.
My baby's gonna be delivered any minute.

4
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,979
- Hey, get out of the way.
- Hey, I'm gonna be a dad.

5
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,854
Congratulate me.

6
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,016
Good for you, Herb.

7
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,818
Don't even think about it.

8
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,774
Hey!

9
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,140
Sorry. How are you?
Nice to see you. I'm gonna be a dad!

10
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,853
Congrats!

11
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,857
Hey, Mr. Nuts,
did you hear the news?

12
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,612
- Yeah.
- Beautiful day, isn't it?

13
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,457
I'm here. I'm here.

14
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,738
- I'm here.
- Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

15
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,618
You missed the delivery.

16
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,369
It's okay.
Making the baby's the fun part.

17
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,056
Honey, I think
you've got the wrong...

18
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,618
No, I don't need to see the directions.

19
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,098
Push, push.

20
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,813
Push!

21
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,210
Twelve hours of labor.

22
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,138
Oh, but it was worth it.

23
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,416
Look at him. Look at him.

24
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,895
Rodney Copperbottom.

25
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,455
He's got your mom's eyes
and my dad's nose.

26
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,850
I knew we were smart
to save those parts.

27
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,137
This Copperbottom will do great things
for the world, I can feel it.

28
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,574
- Honey?
- What?

29
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,731
What's that extra piece?

30
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,132
Oh, no, they always put in an extra...

31
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,931
We did want a boy, right?

32
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,856
This won't hurt a bit, son.

33
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,977
Got your nose. Got your nose.

34
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,772
Got your...

35
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,176
- Hi, son.
- Are those my big-boy parts?

36
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,898
They sure are.

37
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,291
They're not shiny.

38
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,015
Well, they're not brand-new.
They're preowned. So...

39
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,735
They're hand-me-downs
from your cousin Jeffrey.

40
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,419
And they're only for a year.

41
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,931
Hey, Dad, who's that?

42
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,330
That, Rodney, is Bigweld.

43
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,576
The greatest robot in the world.

44
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,578
I thought you were
the greatest robot in the world.

45
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,298
No, besides me.

46
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,212
He's the head of Bigweld Industries.

47
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,412
He invents things
that make everyone's life better.

48
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,498
- Could I meet him?
- Sure, maybe someday.

49
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,974
- Dad?
- Yeah?

50
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,769
- What do you do?
- Me? I work in a big, fancy restaurant.

51
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,210
I'm a dishwasher.

52
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,649
<i>And now, live from Robot City,
it's The Bigweld Show.</i>

53
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,098
Oh, yeah!

54
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,173
Come on, Dad, you're missing it.

55
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,729
All right, Rodney.
All right, I'm coming. I'm coming.

56
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,175
I had to bring work home
with me again, I'm sorry.

57
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,217
Mr. Gunk has really been piling it on.

58
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,168
<i>And now, the host of our show,
Bigweld.</i>

59
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,652
<i>Welcome. This week I thought you'd like
to take a look around Bigweld Industries.</i>

60
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,648
<i>This here is the front gate.
Kind of cute, ain't it?</i>

61
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,737
- Good morning, Tim.
- Good morning, Mr. Bigweld, sir.

62
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,896
Tim, who closed the front gate?

63
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,250
Well, I just thought since...

64
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,209
We never shut the gate, Tim.

65
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,457
Shutting this gate means
shutting out fresh ideas.

66
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,134
See, every day, robots come here
from hither and yon...

67
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,416
...bringing us new ideas.

68
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,532
And I listen to
every single one of them.

69
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:13,014
So remember, whether a bot is made
of new parts, old parts or spare parts...

70
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,819
...you can shine
no matter what you're made of.

71
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,976
He's talking to me, Dad.

72
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,893
He sure is, son. He sure is.

73
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,336
<i>Okay, folks, let's get to inventing.</i>

74
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,058
<i>You know, I love to tinker...</i>

75
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:35,129
<i>...but all the tinkering in the world isn't
useful unless it starts with a good idea.</i>

76
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:42,413
So look around for a need and start
coming up with ideas to fill that need.

77
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,129
One idea will lead to another,
and before you know it...

78
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,330
...you've done it.
See a need, fill a need.

79
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,850
That's it, Dad. I have to look for...

80
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,933
...a need.

81
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,534
Easy, now.

82
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,372
- Hey there, sport.
- Oh, hi.

83
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,378
These are your 12-year-old parts.
They're...

84
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,094
Hand-me-downs. I know, Dad.

85
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,218
- I don't mind.
- They are from your cousin...

86
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,773
...Veronica.

87
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,454
You know how popular she is.

88
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,932
Thanks.

89
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,419
Oh, hey. Hey.

90
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,254
Soon as you reach the age where your
warranty expires, you start falling apart.

91
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,849
Pretty soon there's gonna be
more duct tape than me.

92
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,251
- Can I try it now, Dad?
- Oh, Rodney...

93
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,294
- Have you worked all the kinks out of it?
- This is gonna make your job easy.

94
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,411
I invented it for you.

95
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,932
Okay. Let's try it.

96
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,734
Great. Okay, this is it.

97
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,290
Wonderbot, go to work.

98
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,012
Yeah, yeah.

99
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,489
Hey!

100
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,739
Copperbottom!

101
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,214
- Mr. Gunk.
- What is that?

102
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,133
- Oh, that. My son made it.
- What's it doing?

103
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,128
Mr. Gunk, please,
you're making it nervous.

104
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,535
It's wrecking my kitchen!

105
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,088
- I'll stop it.
- No!

106
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,934
Your son, huh?

107
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,415
It wasn't his fault.
He had nothing to do with it.

108
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,969
Yes, sir, he's a brilliant boy.
An inventor.

109
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:15,014
You, clean up this mess.
And, you, get out.

110
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,494
Inventor.

111
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,255
You're the hand-me-down son of a
dishwasher, and that's all you'll ever be.

112
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:24,777
Somebody scrape this crud off of me.
And serve it to the customers.

113
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,134
<i>Roundtrip or one-way?</i>

114
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,137
One-way.

115
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,136
There you are. I told you I'd find him.

116
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,736
- It's a mother's instinct.
- Instinct? He left us a note:

117
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,255
"I'm leaving.
I'll be at the train station. "

118
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,974
Never mind. Pick up that suitcase.
You're coming home.

119
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:48,253
No, Mom. I have to do this.
I'm going to Robot City tonight.

120
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,218
I'm gonna get a job and I'm gonna
help Dad pay back Mr. Gunk.

121
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,694
Talk to him.

122
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,579
- Ro...
- Robot City? You're just a kid.

123
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,771
I'm never gonna be someone here.

124
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,534
I wanna be an inventor.
I wanna meet Bigweld.

125
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,053
I wanna be somebody.

126
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,659
You are somebody.

127
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,050
Somebody who's not
getting on that train.

128
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,650
- Yes, I am.
- Talk to him.

129
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,099
- One ticket for Robot City.
- Where are you going?

130
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,292
- Not me. Him.
- But...

131
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,937
Rodney, did you know that when I was
your age, I wanted to be a musician?

132
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,536
I played pretty well too...

133
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,578
...but my dad was worried
I wouldn't be able to make a living.

134
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,534
So I got refitted to be a dishwasher.
Now, I'm not complaining.

135
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,612
But I've always said to myself...

136
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,776
...if I could do it over again,
I would follow my dream.

137
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,936
You've got greatness in you, Rodney.

138
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,579
Never doubt it.

139
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,577
You go to Robot City.

140
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,892
You go meet Bigweld,
and you show him your big ideas.

141
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,334
And, Rodney...

142
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,175
...never, never give up.

143
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,454
All aboard.

144
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,652
Mom.

145
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,409
I won't let you down, Dad.

146
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,933
I'll make you proud.

147
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,812
I know you will.

148
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,858
Excuse me, I wonder if...

149
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,772
- Gave at the office.
- I wonder if you...

150
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,931
Could you direct me
to Bigweld Indust...?

151
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,375
- What?
- Perfect. That will be 50 bucks.

152
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,768
Fifty bucks? For what?

153
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,454
A beautiful picture
of your first moment in Robot City.

154
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,690
There. Your second moment.
That's another $50.

155
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,618
Are you keeping track?

156
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,172
Come on, work with me, work with me.
More pout, less pose.

157
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,178
Great. Inside of you is a fashion model
waiting to throw up.

158
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,577
Give me those eyes. Big eyes, big eyes.
Give me big anime eyes.

159
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,891
- Yeah! Loving it, loving it, loving it!
- I don't want any pictures.

160
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,419
- You don't?
- No.

161
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,289
That's all right. There's no film.
Would you like a map to the stars' homes?

162
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,098
Where did he go?

163
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,252
- Buddy, wanna buy a watch?
- Don't buy us, we're fakes.

164
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,052
Next.

165
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,808
Excuse me, how do I get
to Bigweld Industries?

166
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,254
Oh, great...

167
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,938
Never mind.

168
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,257
Hi, excuse me.
How do I get to Bigweld Industries?

169
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,939
What?

170
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,258
Yeah, thanks.

171
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,650
<i>Cross-town express
to Foundry District...</i>

172
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,573
<i>...with stops at Bigweld Industries
and Battery Park only.</i>

173
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,573
<i>Please tighten all spools, nuts, bolts
and detachable appendages.</i>

174
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,653
<i>Riders with high oil pressure
are advised to take the local.</i>

175
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,618
<i>Thank you, and have a nice day.</i>

176
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,375
No, no.

177
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,569
- Say, are you following me?
- No.

178
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,459
- First time on the cross-town express?
- Well, actually, I...

179
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,894
Oh, boy.

180
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,536
Good luck in the big city. If you can
make it here, you can make it anywhere.

181
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,335
And if you can't make it here,
welcome to the club.

182
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,134
- Oh, no.
- What? What is it?

183
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,137
We're going off the track.
We're gonna crash!

184
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,615
- What?
- I don't wanna die.

185
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,095
I was just kidding.
Just put your head between your legs.

186
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,259
Yeah!

187
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,815
There goes my stop.

188
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,693
I tell you, the things that fall off me...
It's embarrassing.

189
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,413
Sorry.

190
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,336
You know, it used to be a lot worse.
They had this giant hammer...

191
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,058
Oh, they brought it back.

192
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,970
Stick with me. I know this town
like the back of my hand.

193
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,370
Hey, that's new.

194
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,775
Excuse me. Can I help you?

195
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,572
Sorry, I...

196
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:45,535
- Hey, you're Tim from the TV show.
- That's me.

197
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,014
Well, hey, Tim.

198
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,933
Who closed the gate?
It's never supposed to be...

199
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,419
Yeah, okay, what do you want?

200
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,215
I'd like to see Mr. Bigweld.

201
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,019
I'm an inventor.

202
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,609
Oh, why didn't you say so?

203
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,811
Stand back.

204
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,378
Thanks.

205
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,013
What?

206
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,531
I got you. You see, because you were
all excited and then, boom!

207
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,098
All right, I had my laugh. Go on in.

208
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,892
Now, that's funny.

209
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,731
The second time.

210
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:46,132
You really think I'm gonna let you in.
But I'm not.

211
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,059
Sorry, kid, nobody gets in.
Company rules.

212
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,297
Company ru...? Well, then
how do they hire new inventors?

213
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,730
They don't. Those days are over.

214
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,939
My advice: Come back two years ago.
Then the job is yours.

215
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:16,615
So remember, whether a bot is made
of new parts, old parts or spare parts...

216
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,050
...you can shine
no matter what you're made of.

217
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,570
My goodness,
what a remarkable legacy.

218
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,538
Concern for the common robot.

219
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,858
You don't come across old-fashioned
values like that anymore, friends.

220
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,499
And for good reason.

221
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,491
There's no money in it!

222
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,335
Hello? Memo to Bigweld:
We're not a charity.

223
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,498
That's why old fat face
no longer sits in the big chair.

224
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,093
He's a relic.

225
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,373
So I don't wanna hear another,
"Where's Bigweld?"

226
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,135
We'll see him next month at the
Bigweld Ball. He always goes to that.

227
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,216
Now, let's get down to the business
of sucking every loose penny...

228
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,258
...out of
Mr. and Mrs. Average-Knucklehead.

229
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,094
What's our big-ticket item?

230
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,095
Upgrades, people. Upgrades.

231
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,773
That's how we make the dough.

232
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,536
Now, if we're telling robots that no matter
what they're made of, they're "fine"...

233
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,010
...how can we expect them to feel
crummy enough about themselves...

234
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,694
...to buy our upgrades
and make themselves look better?

235
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,210
Therefore, I've come up
with a new slogan.

236
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,856
"Why be you when you can be new?"

237
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,094
I gotta tell you, I think it's brilliant...

238
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:44,096
...but, honestly, I'd like to hear
what you employees think about this.

239
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,253
- Hear, hear.
- Out of the ballpark, Ratchet.

240
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,458
Just don't look down.

241
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,169
Hey.

242
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,572
Get off.

243
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,732
Go on, get off.

244
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,092
Get off of...

245
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,860
Cappy, you haven't said a word.

246
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,729
- It gave me chills.
- Thank you, thank you.

247
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,771
- But...
- But?

248
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,768
I'm just wondering,
why would robots buy new upgrades...

249
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,500
...if parts are so much cheaper?

250
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,855
Oh, right. Well, that's easy.

251
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:37,810
Because as of today,
we are no longer making spare parts.

252
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,979
Do you know what I call robots
who can't afford upgrades? Scrap metal.

253
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,212
You see them on the streets,
misshapen and rust-covered.

254
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:49,936
They turn your insides out.
You wanna run home and scrub yourself.

255
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,933
Now, Cappy, I want your department
to push our new slogan.

256
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,859
In fact, I'm moving you
into the office right next to mine.

257
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:59,410
We'll be working very,
very closely together on this one.

258
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,571
- Won't that be fun?
- Oodles.

259
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,290
- Oh, so sorry, I...
- What the...?

260
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:21,575
Sir, I am a young inventor, and it has
been my dream to come to Robot City...

261
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,011
...and to present my ideas
to Mr. Bigweld.

262
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,772
Who doesn't seem to be here.

263
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:31,332
Gee, no, no. But while he's away,
he left me in charge.

264
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,179
Oh, well, then let me show you
what this can do.

265
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:39,814
I have a better idea. Why don't you
let me show you what it can do.

266
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,254
It can do this!

267
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,979
So how did it go?

268
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,170
What the heck
is going on around here?

269
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:14,731
Some highly polished jerk
is sitting in Bigweld's chair.

270
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,288
And you're sitting
on the sidewalk, magnetized.

271
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,539
Listen, I'll be back,
and I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

272
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,652
When you pick a lost cause,
you really commit.

273
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,369
Where do they make dreamers like you?
Get lost, freak!

274
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,530
All right, break time.

275
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,616
All right, break time's over.

276
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,498
Chop-chop.

277
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,293
Look who's here.

278
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:49,175
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie. How's my boy?

279
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:53,498
Great. I did just what you told me.
No more spare parts.

280
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:57,619
In a couple of weeks, those broken-down
losers out there will be scrap metal.

281
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,539
You will be up to your bloomers
in broken-elbow junk.

282
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,378
Such a good boy.

283
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,132
And after you finish off Bigweld...

284
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,370
...there will be nobody
out there to fix them.

285
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,491
Exactly!

286
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,611
You wanna swing that one
by me again?

287
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,971
Idiot! Those outmodes look up to him.

288
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:17,570
- Suppose he decides to come back?
- Oh, come on, Mom.

289
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:21,011
- He's not gonna be trouble where he is.
- What are you afraid of?

290
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,454
Grow some bolts.

291
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,015
Or do you want to end up
like your father?

292
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,495
Hey, son. Good to see you.

293
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,099
Think what it would mean.

294
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:33,936
Not Bigweld Industries,
Ratchet Industries.

295
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,374
Keep talking.

296
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,054
Ratchet City!

297
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,132
Yes, everything shiny.

298
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:45,088
No more Bigweld, no more outmode.

299
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,012
Let's do it!

300
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,171
That's my boy!

301
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,856
Are you hungry?
Can I get you something?

302
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:02,774
- You look thin.
- No, no, no, Mom. I gotta go. Bye.

303
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,055
Bye, Pop.

304
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,138
So long, son.
Good luck with your dastardly plans.

305
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,978
Hey.

306
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,138
Hi there.

307
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:40,057
Listen, if I seem to be getting smaller,
it's because I'm leaving.

308
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,899
Foot, don't fail me now.

309
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,978
Stop! Hey, you got my foot!

310
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,179
Oh, great. Happy now?

311
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,452
Not until you give me back
my foot, you mugger.

312
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:36,255
I am not a mugger. I happen to be...

313
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,455
...a scrounger.

314
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,890
I didn't know you were
at the end of that foot.

315
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,290
Here, let me help you with that.

316
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,933
No, no, no, I'll do it myself.

317
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,136
I have my pride, you know. Over here.

318
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,690
Oh, no. No, not that close.
Hold on, hold on.

319
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,498
No. No, no.

320
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,019
What's the use? There's nothing left.

321
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:00,695
Hey, Diesel, I found you a voice box.

322
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,214
Here's another one.

323
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,976
That's no good. Give me that.

324
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,655
I can never find parts in my size.

325
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,296
What is it, boy?

326
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,409
Hey, Fender, have you lost weight?

327
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,536
Lost weight?

328
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,931
Look at where you're looking.
He's a head in a basket.

329
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,250
We're doomed, I knew it.
We're doomed.

330
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:40,294
Yeah, will you shut up, you neurotic nut?
Why, I'd smack you if I had a hand.

331
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,851
Wow, speak of the devil, here I come.

332
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,089
Dang!

333
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,734
Check this out.

334
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:52,410
Who would throw away
such a cute little doodad?

335
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,299
- Don't be scared.
- Hey, that's mine.

336
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,732
That's him. That's the guy.
I would know that face.

337
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,653
I know that face,
and I know that foot.

338
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,813
He's over there, moron.

339
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,210
That's the perpetrator.
He knocked my head off.

340
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:09,019
- You want another piece of me?
- All right, buster.

341
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:13,014
If you think you can mess with my
big brother, you're... You're kind of cute.

342
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,695
Piper, would you behave yourself.

343
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,533
Now, come on,
let's get Fender fixed. Again.

344
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,129
Here's your thingamabob.

345
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,450
By the way, the name's Piper.

346
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,690
Rhymes with "viper. "

347
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,538
See you around.

348
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,210
We've told you a hundred times:

349
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,496
"Don't talk to strange men. "
Thank you, Manuel.

350
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,658
I talk to you.
Who's stranger than that?

351
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,571
I got good news, and I got bad news.

352
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:53,055
- What's the bad news?
- I checked the stock book.

353
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,417
And as of today, they are no longer
making parts for your model.

354
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,094
You have been officially outmoded.

355
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,779
Outmoded? Well, that's fine.

356
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,453
What's the good news?!

357
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:07,256
Well, when we had your parts,
they were on sale.

358
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:16,179
How could this happen to me?
I'm practically a kid.

359
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:20,134
Look, pull yourself together.
All you need is an upgrade.

360
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,180
That new-upgrade smell.

361
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,848
Just came in, fully loaded. Look.

362
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,971
It's got cup-holders, standard.

363
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,533
Does it come in plus sizes?

364
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:35,171
Sure, take a look at the new
Bigweld spring collection.

365
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:40,853
I can't afford that fancy stuff.
All I need is one stinking neck joint.

366
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,171
No. Why did this happen to me?

367
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,976
I'm hurting me. Idiot.

368
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,536
Sorry, pal, it's either upgrade
or the chop shop for you.

369
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,378
The chop shop?

370
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,132
I'm fine, I'm fine. Look, no hands.

371
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,248
Ta-da! I'm back. Miss me?

372
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,054
- No one's going to the chop shop.
- That's right.

373
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,051
What do you think
we can get for him?

374
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,575
Will you stop? Listen, shiny pants...

375
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,169
...you get back there
and find a part for my brother.

376
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:18,652
We are not junk, we are not scrap,
and we will not be treated this way.

377
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,178
I'm sorry. I don't have the parts.

378
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,298
Well, do you have two washers,
an S-spring and some Fastweld?

379
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,893
I can fix you easy.

380
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:32,217
The Force is strong with this one.

381
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,658
When was the last time
you got oiled?

382
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,175
I can't answer that
with my kid sister here.

383
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,614
Can it, Fender.

384
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,095
Hold still. This might tickle.

385
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,137
We haven't been properly introduced.

386
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,217
I'm Fender. Used to be Bumper...

387
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,769
...but had to change it
when we came in to the country.

388
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,532
Copperbottom, Rodney Copperbottom.

389
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,698
Riddle me this:
Why did I meet you among the garbage?

390
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,334
Well, today I tried
to get in to see Bigweld.

391
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:10,049
Well, if you find him, tell him
we really need him to come back.

392
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,898
He cared about bots like us.

393
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,172
I heard they've done him in
and left the rest of us to fall apart.

394
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,936
Well, that ought to do it.

395
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,615
Look at that! And he fixed my neck.

396
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,611
- Sweeper!
- Sweeper?

397
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,211
Make yourself scarce.

398
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,368
What's the big deal?

399
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:37,249
- Well, if you're an outmode like Fender...
- Hey.

400
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,655
They sweep you up
and take you to the chop shop.

401
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:44,257
Where they melt you down
and turn you into something else.

402
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,138
You mean...?

403
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,248
Yep.

404
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,739
Sweepers. Sweepers.

405
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:53,492
Help. Here's one outmode
you're not gonna get.

406
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,611
Fender, run!

407
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,012
That was close.

408
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,614
When in Robot City,
guests of the Rusties... That's us.

409
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,419
- stay at Aunt Fanny's boarding house,
where our motto is:

410
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,935
"Beats rusting outside. "

411
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,179
Let me just let her know you're here.
Aunt Fanny!

412
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,848
- We brought someone.
- I'm in the kitchen.

413
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,932
- Are you sure your aunt won't mind?
- Relax, she's not my aunt.

414
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,888
She just takes in bots who are broke.
Bless her little heart.

415
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,056
Well, then why is she called
Aunt Fanny?

416
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,778
We couldn't call her Aunt Booty.

417
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,773
Oh, crap.

418
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,532
She's a little artsy-fartsy.

419
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,533
The artsy's okay,
but when she gets fartsy...

420
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,168
Look at... Oh, right on my shoes.

421
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,819
I'm so clumsy.

422
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,938
Well, hello there. What's your name?

423
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,334
I'm Rodney Bigbottom...

424
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,458
No, I'm Rodney Copperbottom.
Copperbottom.

425
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,131
That's a wonderful name, Bigbottom.

426
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,693
Well, I just...

427
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,533
- What happened to your friend?
- He's been rear-ended.

428
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,496
Oh, there you are.

429
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,060
Aunt Fanny, he needs a place to stay.

430
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,734
Well, just make yourself at home.

431
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,856
Thank you. That's very kind of you.

432
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,373
My pleasure.

433
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,173
See a need, fill a need.

434
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,893
Hey, just like Bigweld.

435
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,092
Bigweld. That's a lot of robot.

436
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,896
Come on. You can bunk with me.

437
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,857
We'll ignore the gossip.

438
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,732
You missed a spot.

439
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,931
Fender, get out of my room!

440
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,414
I'm not in your room.

441
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,696
I am now. Now I'm not.
I am. Not. Am...

442
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,771
Get out of my room.

443
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:57,136
Oh, man, this is my third oil change
today. Something's wrong with me.

444
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,453
Sorry.

445
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,292
Here we are. Home sweet home.

446
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,735
What's mine is yours.

447
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,413
- Oh, dear.
- I'll get them.

448
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,411
Look at that.
Now they're arm-wrestling.

449
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:16,016
Could you separate them?
Hurry, my backside itches.

450
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:43,134
I know that sounds bad,
but I'm just doing musical arm farts.

451
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,259
You know how to do those?

452
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,691
They're hard to do, because we're metal,
but that's where the skill comes in.

453
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,578
I'm real close. Listen.

454
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,298
No, wait.

455
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,178
No, wait, wait.

456
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:59,017
You can't tell me that didn't sound like a...
Like an old man.

457
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,257
You know, I'm a little tired.
Maybe tomorrow.

458
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,411
Kind of a rough day, huh?

459
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,180
Kind of. My dad's probably
sitting by the phone...

460
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,296
...waiting for his brilliant son
to call...

461
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,736
...and tell him what a big success
my first day was.

462
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,619
I know it's not your problem.

463
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,055
If you burden your friends,
you won't have any.

464
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,812
What are you, a fortune cookie?

465
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,574
"That's what friends... "

466
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,134
You consider me a friend?

467
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,171
Sure, what else would I consider you?

468
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,934
An embarrassment,
a way to rebel against your parents...

469
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,330
...a desperate cry for help.
The list is endless.

470
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,139
Let's just stick with friend.

471
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,098
You know, even though you had
a discouraging day, remember...

472
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,057
...there's another one
coming tomorrow.

473
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,939
You know, my last roommate
jumped out that window.

474
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,491
Hey, Fender.

475
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,532
Yeah, baby. Let it rip!

476
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,171
Guys, come on,
what are you, 3 years old?

477
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,251
This is how a man does it.

478
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,411
You guys are so gross.

479
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,492
Besides, this is how you do it.

480
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,699
Hey, kids, get a load of this.

481
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,931
Aunt Fanny...

482
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,091
...we were using our arms.

483
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,774
Oh, excuse me.

484
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,693
Lady, please...

485
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,256
...see a doctor.

486
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,739
Breakfast.

487
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,339
This will perk everyone up.

488
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,730
Some of Aunt Fanny's
fresh-brewed grease.

489
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,219
Yummy!

490
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,729
Careful, it's hot.

491
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,011
So, what are you guys doing today?

492
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,650
- We're doing it.
- What about you?

493
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,697
Bigweld's disappeared,
and you're sitting here.

494
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,532
That's already been established.

495
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,732
- I gotta find out what happened to him.
- Hey, you want my advice?

496
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,652
- Sure.
- Forget it.

497
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:05,210
"Never try, never fail. "
Those are the words I live by.

498
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:08,332
Crank, the idol of millions is gone,
and no one seems to care.

499
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,735
There should be an angry mob
out there.

500
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,413
What the...?

501
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,451
Wow, that was great, psychic friend.

502
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,930
Now say, "Money should be
falling from the sky. "

503
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,489
Say it. Say it.

504
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,410
Sorry, folks, all sold out.

505
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,810
Nothing but upgrades from here on in.

506
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,619
But I like myself just the way I am.

507
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,169
- We can't afford upgrades!
- Let's get him!

508
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:38,252
Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?
Don't throw me.

509
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,131
Isn't that the guy
that fixed Fender's neck?

510
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,892
Yeah, that guy fixes bots.

511
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,812
Yeah, that kid can help you.

512
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:47,136
Brace yourself.
You're about to get popular.

513
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,978
Only those with insurance.

514
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:53,018
Oh, I forgot. Everybody, come on.

515
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,735
Parts, man. I need parts.

516
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,539
You don't look that... bad.

517
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,135
- Hey, everybody, spare parts!
- Yeah!

518
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:05,412
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What's wrong with you robots?

519
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,736
You should all be ashamed
of yourselves.

520
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,333
Why do you have two noses?

521
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,492
One's for showing, one's for blowing.

522
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,891
- Sorry.
- Hey, could you look at my arm?

523
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,410
- Nice grip.
- Like iron.

524
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,612
- I can't get rid of this spare tire.
- I am losing my mind.

525
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,693
Back off, back off.

526
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,454
He's got his own dreams
that won't come true.

527
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,219
See a need, fill a need.

528
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,093
Wait.

529
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,817
Who wants to get fixed?

530
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:22,418
Thanks, Rodney. You're number one.

531
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,456
<i>Rodney! Rodney! Rodney!</i>

532
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,812
Oh, yeah.

533
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:55,092
I have never felt so relaxed.

534
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:59,412
Say, do you mind giving me a little
scratch between the shoulder blades?

535
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:02,499
There you... Easy, tiger.

536
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,252
Hey! Take it easy.

537
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,695
Hey, what are you trying to do,
kill me?

538
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,454
Relax. It's me, your mommy.

539
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,293
- How did you get in here?
- I came up the air shaft.

540
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:15,020
I know you don't like
anybody here to see me.

541
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,899
- Well, what do you want?
- Someone's fixing them.

542
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:21,012
- What?
- Someone is repairing outmodes...

543
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,740
...and they are laughing at you.
- Who?

544
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,289
And are you sure they're not
laughing with me?

545
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:27,974
Yes.

546
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:31,849
So what if one crazy fanatic repairs
a few outmodes? Who cares?

547
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:35,456
Think. Use those brains
I stole for you. Today, it's one.

548
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:38,498
What about tomorrow, when
everybody gets the idea this is okay?

549
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:41,333
"We can fix ourselves.
We don't need upgrades.

550
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,853
We want Bigweld. "

551
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,931
Then what happens to you?

552
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,971
Okay, okay. Take it easy.

553
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:50,018
We've got to find out
who this is and stop him.

554
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:53,769
Not stop him, crush him, destroy him.

555
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:58,013
And by the way, I brought you
a little something for your desk.

556
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:08,253
- Is there anyone else waiting?
- Let me look.

557
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,250
- A few.
- "A few"?

558
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:15,412
What did you expect, Rodney?
Bigweld was gone.

559
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:20,051
Sweepers were on the loose,
but then came Copperbottom.

560
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:22,609
I'm getting all static-y
just thinking about it.

561
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:25,493
I'm not Bigweld.
These robots need parts.

562
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:28,254
Mail call. Mail call.

563
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,695
Copperbottom,
this one's from your mom.

564
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,851
Oh, is there anything for me?

565
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,659
Oh, I got something for you.

566
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,492
That's from my sister.

567
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,093
I recognize the handwriting.

568
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,292
Is anything wrong?

569
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,770
I'll say. His father's got
one foot in the junkyard...

570
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:48,455
...and if they can't find new parts
for him, he's only got a few miles left.

571
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:51,579
Rodney, are you really worried
about your dad?

572
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,293
Do you wanna go home?

573
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,411
Well, if I go home,
I still can't help him.

574
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:58,048
We're out of parts.
We've gotta get to Bigweld.

575
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:01,178
He's the only one that can fix this.

576
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:06,411
He's trying to tell us something.
What is it, boy? What's wrong?

577
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,778
Bigweld is going...

578
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,214
...dancing.

579
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:14,292
Of course, the Bigweld Ball.

580
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:17,299
You can't have the Bigweld Ball
without Bigweld.

581
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:20,060
Well, that's it, then.
I'm going to the Bigweld Ball.

582
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,290
What? That's the fanciest party
of the year.

583
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,052
You'll never get past the gate.

584
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:37,452
- Can I help you?
- I think maybe you can.

585
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:40,692
This is Count Roderick
von Brokenzipper.

586
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,816
Formerly Count Velcro.

587
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,259
Where are the trumpets?

588
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:48,133
We were promised trumpets
to announce the count's arrival.

589
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,417
Sorry, Your Grace.
Beat me until you're happy.

590
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:54,856
He's happy. And I'm not feeling
too bad myself.

591
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:58,730
- Let me... You're not on the list.
- We're what?

592
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,731
Once again.

593
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,417
Thank you. Fine, we will go.

594
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:06,172
You'll explain to your superiors...

595
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:10,458
...why we were not able to attend your
little luau, barn dance, whatever it is.

596
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:12,651
But we're leaving in a huff.

597
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:15,459
No, no. No. Please, go right in.

598
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,532
In fact, would the count
like to hit me?

599
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:21,618
The count hit you?
The arrogance of some people.

600
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,613
I will hit you on his behalf.

601
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:26,973
Thank you, Your Grace.

602
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,339
Okay, let's split up.

603
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,219
If you see Bigweld, come and find me.

604
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:37,094
If anything goes wrong,
we'll signal each other.

605
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:40,696
What kind of signal do you want?
You want something kind of subtle, like:

606
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,019
Or:

607
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,613
Oh, how about this:

608
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:53,571
Ricola!

609
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:56,215
Subtle. Let's get to work.

610
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,339
A screwdriver, please.
Shaken, not stirred.

611
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,899
Yes, sir.

612
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,930
I'll have what he's having.

613
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:25,259
You know, Cappy, it's nice that you
can see me like this, away from work.

614
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:29,333
See my more casual, fun-loving side.

615
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,809
Now, where were we?

616
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:38,296
Well, there are never any
interesting men at these parties.

617
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:41,372
Hello, ladies.
Fender von Fender at your service.

618
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,895
Hi, I'm Loretta...

619
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:45,288
...Geargrinder.

620
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:49,772
Anyone dressed as badly as you are
must be an eccentric billionaire.

621
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:54,053
Ladies and gentlebots,
now coming to the stage...

622
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,211
...the top bot, the big bolt...

623
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:59,975
...who's your daddy?
Mr. Phineas T. Ratchet.

624
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:03,257
Thank you. We now come
to the point of the evening...

625
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:06,696
...where I have the tremendous honor
of introducing...

626
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:09,897
- Excuse me. Sorry.
... our beloved founder, Mr. Bigweld...

627
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,534
...who, unfortunately,
is unable to attend.

628
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:16,260
- What?
- He sends his apologies...

629
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:18,888
...his love and a small box
of assorted cookies.

630
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,978
- Not coming?
- And what are you doing here?

631
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,812
What have you done with Bigweld?

632
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,890
How come we don't see him
anymore, huh?

633
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:31,092
Okay. Security,
we have a party-crasher.

634
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:35,333
Yeah, that's right, and I had to put
all this junk on in order to get in here...

635
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:39,652
...so that I could tell Bigweld
that you are outmoding millions of bots.

636
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,933
And I know because
I spend all day fixing them.

637
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:44,568
You.

638
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:07,370
Oh, my darling, that is the cry
of the deep-doo-doo bird.

639
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,337
I must fly.

640
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,093
Take him for a drive...

641
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:16,094
...and bring me back
his exact weight in paper clips.

642
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,610
- No!
- No?

643
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,252
I'll escort him out.

644
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:25,254
You don't wanna look bad
in front of your people, do you?

645
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,853
- Good point.
- When I get back...

646
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:29,011
...I'll show you my casual,
fun-loving side.

647
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:30,772
Oh, you.

648
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:33,130
- Get moving.
- What? What are you doing?

649
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,131
Saving your life.

650
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,811
- Come on.
- Let him go.

651
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,572
Let him go. Let him go.

652
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,856
- Get out of here, you idiot.
- Get him!

653
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:43,778
- Fender, let's go.
- You know him?

654
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:45,532
Fender, wait for me.

655
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,658
Wonderbot.

656
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,298
Get out of my way!

657
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,491
Hey, Tim,
I'd like to see Mr. Bigweld.

658
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,656
Oh, you again.

659
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:01,852
Oh, that was amazing.

660
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:05,296
- So where do we go now?
- I'm taking you to the train station.

661
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,572
- What? No way.
- You don't know what you're dealing with.

662
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,970
Ratchet will use your head
for a hood ornament.

663
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:13,529
I'm not leaving until I find Bigweld.

664
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,497
- That's not...
- Can't you take me to him?

665
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,936
I must be out of my mind.

666
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:32,375
<i>Au rservoir, my darling.</i>

667
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,776
- Thanks for walking me home.
- Thanks for carrying me up that hill.

668
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:39,892
- Until tomorrow?
- I shall count the seconds.

669
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,177
So far, I'm up to four.

670
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,256
You crazy nut boy.

671
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,576
Crazy about you.

672
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:02,889
<i>I'm singing in the oil</i>

673
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,211
<i>I'm singing in the oil</i>

674
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:09,099
<i>After all that work and toil</i>

675
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:12,969
<i>I'm just slipping in the oil</i>

676
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:16,371
<i>I know where I've been sent</i>

677
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,850
<i>I'm covered in lubricant</i>

678
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,016
My life has turned around.

679
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:25,968
From now on, I'm a winner!

680
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:29,213
Stop, you've made a mistake.
I'm alive. You can't do this.

681
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:30,813
Help.

682
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:41,257
Okay, we tried. Let's get out of here.

683
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:42,899
No, no, no. Something's up.

684
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,971
Look at all these newspapers
and this mail.

685
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:47,859
Come on. They probably
stopped delivering these years ago.

686
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,578
Paper.

687
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,297
Late edition.

688
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,378
- You say something?
- Nice one of you.

689
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:59,259
Come on.
We gotta get you out of here.

690
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:09,770
Big, creaky door.

691
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,055
Perfect.

692
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:37,332
Look at this.

693
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,491
This is Bigweld's actual workshop.

694
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,571
I recognize it from his old TV show.

695
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:45,130
Could you keep it down?
We're not supposed to be here.

696
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:48,619
Do you know what these are?

697
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:51,374
These are Bigweld's
original invention designs.

698
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:54,498
- That's his own writing.
- This is strange.

699
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:56,890
How come it just stops in the middle?

700
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:59,016
Look at this.

701
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:02,650
Remember, he used to have
these on his show?

702
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,095
Rodney, I don't know
how to tell you this, but...

703
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:07,296
Why are they so dusty?

704
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:09,291
Wait, don't.

705
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:37,093
This is much more elaborate
than the ones on his show.

706
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:12,892
Rodney, what do we do?

707
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:16,575
I don't know.
This is kind of a first for me.

708
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,654
- Yeah!
- It's him.

709
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:36,538
- Who's the king of the beach?
- Are you all right?

710
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:40,653
Well, considering I'm an old fat guy
who just crashed to the floor...

711
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:43,459
...I'm fantastic.
Now, who the heck are you?

712
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:44,848
I'm Rodney.

713
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:47,853
Oh, I thought you were
the dominoes delivery boy.

714
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:50,733
Come on, let's set them up again,
only bigger.

715
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:53,738
Sir, is this what you've
been working on?

716
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:56,693
This is why no one sees you?

717
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,979
Young man,
nobody likes a chatterbox.

718
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:02,091
But there's a terrible crisis,
Mr. Bigweld.

719
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:04,496
We need to talk.

720
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:09,573
Son, I've gotta tell you,
you're making a lousy first impression.

721
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:13,892
Please, sir, he is your biggest fan.
In fact, he's an inventor just like you.

722
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,016
- Well...
- Show him that thing you made.

723
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,410
A device? A doohickey?
A thingamajig?

724
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:24,088
Now, don't be scared.
Show Mr. Bigweld what you can do.

725
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:26,455
Go on. It's okay.

726
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,936
Is that what it's supposed to do?

727
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:36,093
It gets nervous under pressure...

728
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,734
Son, let me give you
a good piece of advice.

729
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,697
- Yes?
- Give up.

730
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:43,420
What? You're telling me to quit?

731
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:46,692
I said "give up,"
but "quit" works just as good.

732
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,656
Is that what you did?
Is that why you're sitting here...

733
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:53,937
...letting Ratchet turn robots
like my father into outmodes?

734
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,898
Kid, sometimes you just gotta know
when you're licked.

735
00:55:57,060 --> 00:56:00,450
But you're Bigweld.
You can fix anything.

736
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:02,053
I used to think so.

737
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:05,411
To me, having the company
was all about making life better.

738
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:08,578
With Ratchet, it was making money
that came first.

739
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:12,699
I became old-fashioned, an outmode.

740
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:16,496
Go home, kid.
If he beat me, he's gonna beat you.

741
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:19,857
The world you're looking for
no longer exists. You missed it.

742
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:21,772
Find some other foolish dream.

743
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:24,540
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm very, very...

744
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,498
...very busy.

745
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,218
Yeah, I can see that.

746
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:35,491
All I ever wanted
was to grow up to be like him.

747
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,137
Help. Open the door.

748
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,291
Open the door.

749
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:53,691
Close the door. Close the door!

750
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:06,099
Wow, look at all these parts.
It's a smorgasbord.

751
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:09,093
Look at that. So many things
I've wanted all my life.

752
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,699
Oh, that's pretty.

753
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:29,455
Okay, Mother, this way.

754
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:31,537
Let me look, please. I can't bear it.

755
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:34,056
No peeking, now. It's a surprise.

756
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:35,534
Oh, you are a wicked boy.

757
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,099
And look.

758
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:40,413
- For me?
- It's got a full tank of gas.

759
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:42,491
If you're ready to mow,
she's ready to go.

760
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:45,618
Has any mother ever had a better son?

761
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:48,374
By the way, I found out
who's been fixing those outmodes.

762
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:49,939
So tomorrow, these babies...

763
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,568
...are gonna chop him up
along with all his buddies...

764
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:55,971
...and every other walking pile of junk
I'm sick of looking at.

765
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,853
What's that?

766
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:30,170
This is so wrong. This is so wrong.

767
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:33,334
Help. Help!

768
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:43,129
Rivet Town, please. One-way.

769
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:48,768
Hi, Mom.

770
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:52,012
Oh, I'm doing fine. How are you?

771
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:55,809
<i>- And Dad?
- He's right here. I'll put him on.</i>

772
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:58,414
Hey, buddy, how's it going?

773
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:00,372
Hey, Dad. How are you feeling?

774
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:03,657
Oh, fine, fine. I...

775
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:06,571
I've just been a little
under the weather.

776
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:08,696
No, we're just having a little trouble...

777
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:11,818
...finding your old man
a replacement part, that's all.

778
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:14,659
But let's talk about you.
What kind of work are you doing?

779
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:16,538
What's Bigweld like?
Did you meet him?

780
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:19,414
Yeah, I met him, but...

781
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:21,819
What's wrong, son?

782
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:25,376
It's not how we thought it was, Dad.

783
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:28,259
It's not... I can't...

784
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:30,459
I see.

785
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:32,855
- I'm really sorry I let you down.
- No, no, no.

786
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:35,693
You could never let me down, Rodney.

787
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:40,893
Listen, I know it isn't easy, Rodney...

788
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:43,494
...but a dream
that you don't fight for...

789
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:47,096
...can haunt you
for the rest of your life.

790
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:49,859
Yeah, Dad.

791
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:52,170
<i>It's up to you, son.</i>

792
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:58,731
- Your father loves you very much.
- I know.

793
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:02,688
With our Friends and Family plan, you
can talk to him 500 minutes a month.

794
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:04,373
Free nights and weekends.

795
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:06,849
Yoo-hoo, Rodney!

796
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,612
Wait.

797
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:12,253
- Your suitcase.
- Thanks, Aunt Fanny, but I'm...

798
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,934
The others wanted to come
and see you off too.

799
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,499
Well, why didn't they?

800
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:19,458
Oh, they did.

801
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:22,893
Next time, let's split a cab.

802
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:27,496
Who the heck is she?

803
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:30,612
I used to have a figure like that.

804
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:32,975
Hurry, come on.
One ticket to anywhere.

805
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:34,779
Fender?

806
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,658
I have a sister.

807
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:39,017
An ugly sister.

808
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:41,780
Hey, guess what. It's the sweepers.

809
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:45,376
They're rounding up outmodes
and taking them... What "them"? Us.

810
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,292
- to Madame Gasket's chop shop.

811
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:50,099
- And guess who's really behind it all.
- Ratchet.

812
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,689
You don't wanna guess?
I ran all this way in heels.

813
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:54,339
- Come on, take a stab.
- Ratchet.

814
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:57,373
Ratchet! Listen to me. Listen to me.

815
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:01,055
- We won't last a week.
- Okay, okay. Settle down. I got a plan.

816
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:03,495
- Let's all get on that train.
- Come on.

817
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:06,134
Hey, wait a minute.
You're all giving up?

818
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,211
- You started it.
- Well, I'm ending it.

819
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:11,133
My mistake was hoping that Bigweld
would fight our battles.

820
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,291
Well, he won't. It's up to us.

821
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:16,060
If we don't do something
about Ratchet, no one will.

822
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:17,898
Come on, let's fight back.

823
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:19,977
Fighting never solved anything.

824
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:22,694
Quitting isn't so productive either.
I gotta tell you.

825
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:24,731
It's the big boy.

826
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:26,896
Oh, be still, my pump.

827
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,773
Kid, if you're gonna fight,
I'm going in with you.

828
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:31,259
You... You are?

829
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:34,412
Hey, who's the dame
with the sweet keister?

830
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:36,013
- But why?
- I don't know.

831
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:38,171
I'm a big guy,
and I like women with large...

832
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:40,854
No, no, no.
Why are you gonna help us?

833
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:44,217
Because I wanna grow up
to be like you.

834
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:49,659
Then let's do it.

835
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:54,809
Come on, gang. Let's give
that Ratchet an old-school fix-it!

836
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:59,217
Oh, what a man.

837
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:01,335
Someone get a crane.

838
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:10,258
Mother, I'm an adult, okay?

839
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:13,378
So stop telling me how to kill Bigweld.
I'm doing it today...

840
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:17,533
...how I want, where I want
and with whatever I want.

841
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:24,218
Okay, boardroom, 10 minutes.
I want you both there.

842
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:26,735
Mr. Bigweld, should we come too?

843
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:28,976
No, no. You stay here...

844
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:32,052
...and watch Daddy's limo.
- Yes, sir.

845
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:34,012
I'm going inside to kick some booty.

846
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:36,296
Hey, you know,
your boyfriend here is a genius.

847
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:38,058
- What?
- Oh, he's not my... He is?

848
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:39,858
I am?

849
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:43,175
Thanks for still believing in me.

850
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:47,372
It's good to be home. Toodley-oodley!

851
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:59,091
I use the Brazilian wax. It makes me
feel like every day's a fiesta.

852
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:01,171
Tell Mr. Ratchet his 10:00 is here.

853
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:02,693
I'm all over it. Yes, sir.

854
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:10,933
Mr. Bigweld, sir.

855
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:13,497
Mr. Bigweld, sir.

856
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:19,292
Oh, Mr. Bigweld.

857
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:22,011
No, no. Tell him I'm not here.

858
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:24,853
- Tell him anything, just don't let him in.
- Ratchet!

859
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:29,131
- I'll cut to the point.
- What happened?

860
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,097
Run out of dominoes?
I'll send you more.

861
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,689
- You're fired!
- Fired? On what grounds?

862
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:35,896
This company's
never been more profitable.

863
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:37,818
Profit, schmofit. Now, get out.

864
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:40,853
No, wait, please listen to me.
You can't do this to me.

865
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:43,818
This job is my life.
It means everything to me.

866
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:45,971
You don't know
what I've done to get here.

867
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:50,696
The lies I've told. The lives I've ruined.
This isn't helping me.

868
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:53,370
- Get me security.
- Wait, please.

869
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:56,140
Can't I just make
one more heartfelt plea?

870
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,052
Okay, what did you wanna say?

871
01:03:58,220 --> 01:03:59,733
That.

872
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:03,456
Oh, my gosh.
I'm as crazy as my mother.

873
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:15,774
Take that fish to the chop shop
and put my name on his parking space.

874
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:17,379
Let go of him.

875
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:21,332
Sure. Listen, kid, it's over. You lost.

876
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:24,657
Bigweld is gonna be melted down
into next season's upgrades...

877
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:28,699
...along with you,
your moronic coffeepot and Cappy.

878
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,652
Such a waste.

879
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:07,251
Mr. Bigweld, are you okay?

880
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:10,093
I'm the prettiest girl
at the Harvest Moon Ball.

881
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:12,495
I'll take that as a "no. "

882
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:26,858
Out of the way!

883
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:30,499
Rodney.

884
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,694
<i>Road trip! Road trip! Road trip!</i>

885
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:46,418
You guys are so embarrassing.

886
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:50,139
Oh, that's Rodney.
He's in some kind of trouble.

887
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:52,058
I've gotta repair him.

888
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:54,529
Okay, I got your back.

889
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:02,932
Come on, we've gotta help Rodney.

890
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:07,300
- No, Piper, you stay here.
- No way.

891
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:10,418
Let's be honest. We're headed
for a huge butt-whupping.

892
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:12,730
Whatever happens to us,
make something of yourself.

893
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:16,337
You're the only thing
I've got to leave behind. Goodbye!

894
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:17,899
He's right, Piper.

895
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:20,255
They're headed
for a huge butt-whupping.

896
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:53,132
Okay, got it!

897
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,177
Rodney, what's going on?
Where are we?

898
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:57,012
It's okay. You're all right.

899
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:19,095
Okay, boys, we got them
right where they want us.

900
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:20,659
Boost me up.

901
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:23,458
Watch your hands down there.

902
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:27,530
Rodney! We're here to save you!

903
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:37,058
How do you think it's going so far?

904
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:46,615
The plug.

905
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:49,732
Hold on, guys!
I gotta get to the other side.

906
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:21,250
We're out of here!

907
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:41,972
The chop shop.

908
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:45,616
- That's it. Game over.
- The game is not over.

909
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:47,892
This is our moment to shine.

910
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:50,938
This is where you show
what you're really made of.

911
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:55,778
In my case, it's a rare metal.
It's called "afraidium. "

912
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:58,249
It's yellow. It tastes like chicken.

913
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:01,652
I didn't know I could do that.

914
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:03,179
Rodney's right.

915
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:08,494
I am tired of just complaining
and never doing anything.

916
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:10,173
I... I...

917
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:12,498
I wanna try.

918
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:14,053
No. Forget it. I'm sorry. No.

919
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:17,371
Yes! I want to try.

920
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:19,377
Then you're first.

921
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:22,899
First for what?

922
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:27,059
They want us to upgrade?
Then let's upgrade.

923
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:35,857
Gasket, you're a sick, twisted,
evil robot.

924
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:37,255
I try.

925
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:09,852
Oh, good.

926
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:11,658
Company.

927
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:16,416
So you're the little glob of tin
who's been making all the trouble.

928
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:18,258
Who are these losers?

929
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:20,451
- We, sir...
- I'm a woman.

930
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:22,059
Ouch.

931
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:24,814
We've come to rescue our friend,
you evil bag of bolts.

932
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:27,972
And you will be defeated
by the very outmodes...

933
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:31,257
...that you scorned and defaced.

934
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:34,896
Yeah, because there's seven of us
and only one of you.

935
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:42,008
There's seven of us and... Eight, nine...

936
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:44,057
- Did you count that one?
- I think so.

937
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:46,979
Could you all stop moving around?!
It's so frustrating!

938
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:48,858
I think I counted one of you twice!

939
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:52,132
While you're at it, count these.

940
01:10:57,020 --> 01:11:00,854
As soon as we're done with you,
these hit the streets.

941
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:05,739
This is the last day
any outmode will ever see.

942
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:16,252
Did I miss the butt-whupping?

943
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:20,249
- No.
- Matter of fact, you're a little bit early.

944
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:29,216
<i>Rodney! Rodney! Rodney!</i>

945
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:32,338
- Well, let's get started.
- Testify, sister!

946
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:35,895
- Charge!
- Charge!

947
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:00,569
<i>Oh, no! He's got a steel chair.</i>

948
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:06,049
<i>But he's back up into a neck-breaker.</i>

949
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:08,137
<i>He's up to the top rope.</i>

950
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:11,810
<i>- Look at the hang time!
- That's sure gonna leave a dent.</i>

951
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,730
Say hello to my dimpled friend.

952
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:12,416
This is gonna get greasy!

953
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:20,414
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- I sure am.

954
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:36,693
See a need, fill a need!

955
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:38,891
This isn't what I was thinking at all.

956
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:53,860
What are you doing? Get off me.

957
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:58,371
Let me go! Do as I say. Get off!

958
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:05,534
Ma!

959
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:09,294
My upgrades!

960
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:35,490
It's all right, son.
You can shine no matter what you...

961
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:38,379
No! Just stop!

962
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:39,808
Come on, Rodney.

963
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:42,733
Let's open the gates
of Bigweld Industries forever.

964
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:46,449
Wait a minute.
There's one thing I need to do first.

965
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:51,373
Herb!

966
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:53,377
- Herb!
- Honey, what are you doing here?

967
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:55,895
- It's Rodney, honey.
- Rodney? Is he all right?

968
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:57,539
Come outside. Hurry.

969
01:15:57,700 --> 01:15:59,816
Copperbottom, where are you going?

970
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:01,572
What about the dishes?

971
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:06,054
Hey, get back here!

972
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:08,859
You'll never wash in this town again.

973
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,539
What is all this?
The whole town is out here.

974
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:18,129
- Rodney?
- Dad!

975
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:20,012
There's someone I want you to meet.

976
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:22,376
- Is that...?
- That's Bigweld, Dad...

977
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:24,656
...the greatest robot in the world.

978
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:26,418
Besides you.

979
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:30,818
- I understand you need a few parts.
- Well, I'm not one to complain.

980
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:35,258
Well, then don't. I've brought
enough parts to make two of you.

981
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:39,250
Ladies and gentlebots...

982
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:42,059
...I came all this way...

983
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:44,450
Would you cut that out?
It's very distracting.

984
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:46,053
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

985
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:47,534
Where was I?

986
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:51,170
Mr. and Mrs. Copperbottom,
I came all this way...

987
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:54,776
...to tell you in person
that your son, Rodney...

988
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:58,416
<i>...the man who got me
off my big titanium tochis...</i>

989
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:03,455
...is now my right-hand bot
and my eventual successor.

990
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:07,654
Way to go, Rodney!

991
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:12,289
Oh, Mom.

992
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:14,979
Son.

993
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:19,413
Dad, I know you kind of felt bad
when I was growing up...

994
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:22,378
...that you couldn't give me
a lot of stuff.

995
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:24,571
But you gave me
the most important thing:

996
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:26,577
You believed in me.

997
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:28,891
From the second you were born.

998
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:32,778
Well, Dad, now I want your dream
to come true.

999
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:36,535
Dad, you always wanted to be
a musician.

1000
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:39,538
Now be one, for everyone to hear.

1001
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:52,378
Good for you, Herb!
You did good!

1002
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:54,059
- Good job!
- Way to go.

1003
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:57,013
Now I'm sure I've got a heart,
because it's aching.

1004
01:17:58,020 --> 01:18:00,056
You'll have to forgive me.

1005
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:02,535
I'm a little rusty.

1006
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:18,016
Well, there goes our happy ending.

1007
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:21,013
No. It's a fusion of jazz and funk.

1008
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:22,613
It's called "junk. "

1009
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:38,896
I love you, Herb!

1010
01:19:57,140 --> 01:20:00,291
- Fender!
- Loretta, my darling.

1011
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:02,815
Sorry.

1012
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:09,059
I was on the list!

1013
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:12,937
Don't you know who I am? Wait!
