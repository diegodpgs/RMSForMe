1
00:01:41,987 --> 00:01:44,251
Idiots.

2
00:01:47,993 --> 00:01:52,089
Take the captain beyond the reef
till we get permission
to bring him ashore.

3
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:57,024
For a moment I thought
you were abandoning me.

4
00:01:57,102 --> 00:02:01,505
Fernand Mondego does not
abandon his friends in the face
of stupid, suicidal danger.

5
00:02:01,574 --> 00:02:06,307
However, as Monsieur Morell's
official representative
on this voyage, Edmond,

6
00:02:06,378 --> 00:02:09,438
I must officially tell you
you have overstepped
your bounds as second mate.

7
00:02:09,515 --> 00:02:12,177
Officially. There.
I've covered myself.

8
00:02:12,251 --> 00:02:14,879
If we don't get him to
a doctor, he will die.
Do you understand?

9
00:02:14,954 --> 00:02:17,889
Of course I understand.
Just don't expect me
to do this sober.

10
00:02:17,957 --> 00:02:19,891
- [Horse Whinnies]
- Right.

11
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:23,224
[Fernand]
English dragoons.

12
00:02:23,295 --> 00:02:25,058
Hello!

13
00:02:26,932 --> 00:02:29,400
Dantes, don't.

14
00:02:30,436 --> 00:02:32,267
[Whinnying]

15
00:02:32,338 --> 00:02:34,397
- A little careless,
don't you think?
- We have to talk to someone.

16
00:02:34,473 --> 00:02:37,033
Well, I know, but...

17
00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:38,474
We're French sailors!

18
00:02:38,544 --> 00:02:41,012
- We seek medical attention!
- Come on. Come on.

19
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:44,645
- We come in peace.
- Come on.

20
00:02:45,317 --> 00:02:46,944
We mean no harm!

21
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:48,953
Edmond!

22
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:56,792
Come on! Climb!

23
00:03:06,906 --> 00:03:08,931
Look out!

24
00:03:32,498 --> 00:03:34,125
Fernand!

25
00:03:39,204 --> 00:03:42,640
Good. You finally
hit something.

26
00:03:47,746 --> 00:03:50,271
Lieutenant Graypool.

27
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:52,977
If your thirst for gore demands
the death of these poor fools,

28
00:03:53,052 --> 00:03:55,213
then by all means
shoot them.

29
00:03:55,287 --> 00:03:58,279
But do so with the knowledge
they are no agents of mine.

30
00:03:58,357 --> 00:04:00,518
Now explain yourselves
or be shot.

31
00:04:00,592 --> 00:04:04,255
Sir, I am Edmond Dantes,

32
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:08,027
second mate of the merchant ship
Pharaon, on our way home to Marseilles.

33
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:13,163
This is the shipowner's representative,
Monsieur Fernand Mondego,

34
00:04:13,238 --> 00:04:15,900
son of the Count Mondego.

35
00:04:15,975 --> 00:04:19,536
Our captain has
contracted brain fever,
so we put in here for help.

36
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:27,380
If his coma is genuine,
he won't feel my knife point,
will he?

37
00:04:29,922 --> 00:04:32,720
Only a scratch.

38
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,664
[Flesh Cutting]

39
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,658
Edmond!

40
00:04:42,735 --> 00:04:45,226
- Lieutenant Graypool!
- We came to you in good faith!

41
00:04:45,304 --> 00:04:49,866
- That's for my wounded men.
- And wounded pride, no doubt.

42
00:04:58,017 --> 00:05:01,612
It has been an eventful evening.

43
00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:15,696
If I hadn't have shot those
dragoons, you might by lying in
pieces on the beach right now.

44
00:05:15,768 --> 00:05:20,102
- I almost got us killed.
- Yes, you did.

45
00:05:20,172 --> 00:05:23,471
Yet... we survive.

46
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:26,739
Donne-moi encore
une bouteille du vin

47
00:05:26,812 --> 00:05:28,746
- Whoo-hoo!
- [Laughs]

48
00:05:28,814 --> 00:05:33,251
Donne-moi encore
une bouteille du vin

49
00:05:33,318 --> 00:05:35,548
King's to you, Mondego.

50
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:39,216
Being your friend
is always an adventure. [Laughs]

51
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:42,727
- Yes, it is, isn't it?
- [Laughs]

52
00:05:42,795 --> 00:05:45,059
It's a pity adventurers can't always
be friends though, huh?

53
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,654
What?

54
00:05:46,732 --> 00:05:49,997
Well, it won't always
be like this, will it?

55
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:54,335
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Drink up.

56
00:05:54,406 --> 00:05:58,308
We're drinking
Napoleon Bonaparte's wine.

57
00:05:58,377 --> 00:06:01,244
[Napoleon] I think you'll find
the 1806 the finer vintage.

58
00:06:01,313 --> 00:06:05,215
As long as you're still awake,
Monsieur Dantes, I wonder...

59
00:06:05,284 --> 00:06:07,650
if I might have
a word with you.

60
00:06:09,955 --> 00:06:14,289
I'm curious. What's the significance
of the chess piece?

61
00:06:14,493 --> 00:06:18,429
It's just something
we've done since childhood.

62
00:06:18,497 --> 00:06:22,797
Whenever one of us has had a victory,
king of the moment.

63
00:06:22,868 --> 00:06:25,098
- King of the moment?
- Yes.

64
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:30,073
[Chuckles] In life, we're all
either kings or pawns.

65
00:06:30,142 --> 00:06:34,511
I'm moved by your effort to save
your captain's life, Dantes.

66
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,016
He is my captain...
and my friend, Your Majesty.

67
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,449
Loyal friends
are rare indeed.

68
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:44,114
In fact, it is upon such
a matter I wish to speak.

69
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:48,353
I have written a rather
sentimental letter to an
old comrade in Marseilles.

70
00:06:48,427 --> 00:06:51,021
It's a side of me I prefer
the British not see.

71
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:54,088
Since they have a habit
of opening my mail,

72
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:58,000
I wonder if you would
deliver it for me.

73
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,231
Oh, l-I don't...

74
00:07:00,305 --> 00:07:03,240
It's just a letter
from one old soldier to another.

75
00:07:03,308 --> 00:07:06,175
It's totally innocent,
I assure you.

76
00:07:06,245 --> 00:07:09,703
But more important,
it is the price I demand
for the use of my physician.

77
00:07:13,652 --> 00:07:15,643
Then I agree.

78
00:07:15,721 --> 00:07:17,655
Good.

79
00:07:17,723 --> 00:07:20,920
You are to deliver the letter
to Monsieur Clarion.

80
00:07:20,993 --> 00:07:25,259
- Can you remember that name?
- Monsieur Clarion.
How will I find him?

81
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,265
Oh, he will find you.

82
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:32,099
Now, I do not wish
this letter's existence
to be known to anyone else.

83
00:07:32,171 --> 00:07:35,470
Not even your boon companion back there.
Do you understand?

84
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,873
I'm a man of my word,
Your Majesty.

85
00:07:37,943 --> 00:07:41,674
Yes, I, uh...
I believe you are.

86
00:07:57,129 --> 00:07:59,063
What did he want?

87
00:07:59,131 --> 00:08:04,194
Oh, um, news from France.
That's all.

88
00:08:23,755 --> 00:08:27,748
Time you were on your way.
Your captain has been dead
for half an hour.

89
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,764
Are you sure?

90
00:08:33,832 --> 00:08:37,461
When you have walked
as many battlefields as I,
young Dantes,

91
00:08:37,536 --> 00:08:39,470
you can feel death.

92
00:08:45,244 --> 00:08:47,678
Kings and pawns, Marchand.

93
00:08:47,746 --> 00:08:52,183
Emperors... and fools.

94
00:09:04,396 --> 00:09:07,331
[Chattering]

95
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:10,664
[Man]
Come about!

96
00:09:17,242 --> 00:09:19,210
Drive faster.

97
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,887
[Bell Chiming]

98
00:09:34,426 --> 00:09:36,690
Danglars, what's happened?

99
00:09:36,762 --> 00:09:40,163
Captain Reynaud is dead, sir,

100
00:09:40,232 --> 00:09:42,632
and Edmond Dantes
disobeyed my orders.

101
00:09:42,701 --> 00:09:46,535
Come to my office
and report, Danglars.

102
00:09:46,705 --> 00:09:50,471
- And you, Edmond.
- Will you be needing me,
Monsieur Morell?

103
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:51,702
Go.

104
00:09:56,381 --> 00:09:58,542
Mercedes.

105
00:09:58,617 --> 00:10:03,554
- Where is he? Where is Edmond?
- How lovely to see you too.

106
00:10:03,622 --> 00:10:05,817
You just missed him,
I'm afraid.

107
00:10:05,891 --> 00:10:08,485
Could be a while.
I think he's in trouble.

108
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,585
He said he'd meet us
by the rock. Come on.

109
00:10:10,662 --> 00:10:12,687
I told Dantes
not to go ashore.

110
00:10:12,764 --> 00:10:15,028
Is this true?

111
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,500
I accept
all responsibility.

112
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:21,027
As well you should.
It was all his idea, monsieur.

113
00:10:21,106 --> 00:10:24,872
It should have
been your idea.

114
00:10:24,943 --> 00:10:28,379
Puttin' into Elba didn't save
the captain's life, monsieur.

115
00:10:28,447 --> 00:10:31,610
- I was protectin'the merchandise.
- You were protecting yourself...

116
00:10:31,683 --> 00:10:35,483
by hiding behind your rank
and staying aboard.

117
00:10:35,554 --> 00:10:41,083
Edmond Dantes, I am making you
the new captain of the Pharaon.

118
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:47,294
You presume to demote me?

119
00:10:47,366 --> 00:10:49,300
There is no demotion.

120
00:10:49,368 --> 00:10:53,464
You will remain first mate
under Captain Dantes.

121
00:10:53,538 --> 00:10:56,905
Unless, of course, you choose
to seek another berth.

122
00:11:07,486 --> 00:11:10,580
Now I imagine there's
a certain young lady...

123
00:11:10,655 --> 00:11:13,954
who will want
to hear this news.

124
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:20,429
- [Chuckles]
- Thank you.

125
00:11:28,306 --> 00:11:30,774
Monsieur Morell?

126
00:11:30,842 --> 00:11:36,280
- I understand you had a ship just
returned from Elba, monsieur.
- Yes.

127
00:11:36,348 --> 00:11:41,081
Did anyone aboard
get ashore there by any chance?

128
00:11:41,153 --> 00:11:44,748
They did, but they're
not here at the moment.

129
00:11:45,824 --> 00:11:47,917
Thank you, monsieur.

130
00:11:47,993 --> 00:11:50,655
- May I say who has called upon them?
- Clarion.

131
00:11:50,729 --> 00:11:53,493
The name is Clarion.

132
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:03,033
- Make love to me.
- Will you ever give up?

133
00:12:03,108 --> 00:12:05,599
- He doesn't have to know.
- I'd know.

134
00:12:05,677 --> 00:12:08,077
So would I.

135
00:12:08,146 --> 00:12:11,946
- It'd be our little secret.
- I don't believe in secrets.

136
00:12:12,017 --> 00:12:16,852
You think Edmond doesn't have secrets?
He does. Ask him.

137
00:12:16,922 --> 00:12:20,187
- I know what you want, Fernand.
- You do?

138
00:12:20,258 --> 00:12:24,991
Remember when we were kids and
Edmond got that whistle for his
birthday, and you got a pony?

139
00:12:25,063 --> 00:12:28,863
You were so mad Edmond
was happier with his whistle
than you were with your pony.

140
00:12:28,934 --> 00:12:32,700
I'm not going to be
your next whistle.

141
00:12:35,574 --> 00:12:38,566
How long do you think
it's going to be before
he can afford a wife?

142
00:12:38,643 --> 00:12:42,704
Two years.
Two years. That's all.

143
00:12:42,781 --> 00:12:45,773
Then he gets his captain's
papers, and we can marry.

144
00:12:45,851 --> 00:12:49,844
Two years. I couldn't wait
two years for anything,

145
00:12:49,921 --> 00:12:52,151
particularly
a bride like you.

146
00:12:53,825 --> 00:12:55,315
Hey!

147
00:12:55,393 --> 00:12:57,554
- [Mercedes] There he is.
- Hey!

148
00:12:57,629 --> 00:12:59,824
- [Laughs] Whoo!
- Mercedes!

149
00:13:05,737 --> 00:13:09,070
[Mercedes]
I missed you so.

150
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,506
The missing is over now.

151
00:13:11,576 --> 00:13:15,535
- Are you in trouble?
- No. I'm captain. Come on.

152
00:13:19,651 --> 00:13:22,848
Monsieur Morell
gave me the Pharaon.

153
00:13:22,921 --> 00:13:25,515
Edmond!

154
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,683
King's to me.

155
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:32,787
[Chuckles] Yours is a life
truly blessed, Edmond.

[Clicks Tongue]

157
00:13:38,203 --> 00:13:39,465
Come on.

158
00:13:39,538 --> 00:13:42,701
- You're still the best man.
- I know.

159
00:13:42,774 --> 00:13:44,867
Come on!

160
00:14:13,305 --> 00:14:16,638
Stop that.
You'll go bald.

161
00:14:22,747 --> 00:14:24,840
Do you keep secrets from me?

162
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:28,909
Secrets? No.

Why?

00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,655
Ask me anything
and I'll tell you.

165

We don't have to wait
two years anymore.

166

- As soon as I can afford
the ring, we'll wed...
- I don't need a ring. I don't.

167
00:14:58,216 --> 00:15:00,150
This will be my ring.

168
00:15:00,218 --> 00:15:04,245
And no matter what happens,

169
00:15:04,322 --> 00:15:08,656
you will never see it
off my finger.

Hello, my fine young gentleman.

172
00:15:25,043 --> 00:15:27,068
Care to join me?

173
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,812
So tell me, Mondego,

174
00:15:37,022 --> 00:15:40,253
how did you ever
become friends...

175
00:15:40,325 --> 00:15:43,522
with that righteous little ponce,
Edmond Dantes?

176
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,494
He claims to be my friend,

177
00:15:50,235 --> 00:15:53,227
yet he has the audacity
to keep secrets from me.

178
00:15:53,304 --> 00:15:55,670
What secrets?

179
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,880
[Tapping]

180
00:16:11,956 --> 00:16:16,450
To the new captain
of the Pharaon.

181
00:16:17,729 --> 00:16:21,688
All I am I owe
to you, Father.

182
00:16:23,001 --> 00:16:26,937
May this happy moment
be but the dawn...

183
00:16:27,005 --> 00:16:31,874
of a long and wonderful life
for you both.

[Door Opens]

- Which of you is Edmond Dantes?
- I am.

186
00:16:38,616 --> 00:16:41,779
Edmond Dantes,
you are under arrest by order
of the magistrate of Marseilles.

187
00:16:41,853 --> 00:16:44,083
- Arrest?
- On what charges?

188
00:16:44,155 --> 00:16:46,919
That information is
privileged. Take him.

189
00:16:46,991 --> 00:16:51,485
I demand an explanation.
I demand an explanation!

190
00:16:51,563 --> 00:16:55,659
I'll be back tonight.
Don't worry, Father. This is a mistake.

191
00:16:55,734 --> 00:16:57,964
Mon Dieu.

192
00:17:10,482 --> 00:17:13,178
Well, I must say, Dantes,
you don't have the look of a traitor.

193
00:17:14,452 --> 00:17:16,579
Traitor?

194
00:17:16,654 --> 00:17:20,181
Now, attend me well, Dantes,
for your life may depend on it.

195
00:17:20,258 --> 00:17:23,785
Did you have any personal
contact with Napoleon
when you were on Elba?

196
00:17:23,862 --> 00:17:26,092
Elba, yes, I did.
Well, we did.

197
00:17:26,164 --> 00:17:30,931
I was with the
Count Mondego's son, Fernand,
almost the entire time.

198
00:17:31,002 --> 00:17:34,335
- Do you know Fernand?
- He's a recent acquaintance, yes.

199
00:17:34,405 --> 00:17:38,501
Oh, there you are.
He'll vouch for me.

200
00:17:38,576 --> 00:17:41,136
No doubt, but you said,
"almost the entire time."

201
00:17:43,948 --> 00:17:49,352
Except for when Napoleon asked
me to deliver a personal letter
to a friend in Marseilles.

202
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:53,447
Well, Dantes, it is for
accepting that treasonous
correspondence...

203
00:17:53,525 --> 00:17:57,359
that you have been denounced
by your own first mate,
a Monsieur Danglars.

204
00:17:57,428 --> 00:18:00,192
- What?
- Did you deliver the letter?

205
00:18:00,265 --> 00:18:02,961
No, sir, someone was
supposed to find me.

206
00:18:03,034 --> 00:18:06,162
It's... It's still
in my jacket. Here.

207
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:29,590
- Have you read this?
- No, sir, I can't read.

208
00:18:29,661 --> 00:18:34,564
Well, Dantes,
this is a letter to one
of Napoleon's agents.

209
00:18:34,632 --> 00:18:39,399
It gives the times and
the locations of the British
beach patrols on Elba.

210
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:43,167
Sir, I swear on my mother's
grave, I had no idea.

211
00:18:43,241 --> 00:18:45,209
He swore its contents
were innocent.

212
00:18:52,317 --> 00:18:57,380
No, it's you
that's innocent.

213
00:18:57,455 --> 00:19:00,049
Foolish and innocent.

214
00:19:00,124 --> 00:19:03,753
I believe these are
the worst charges that could
be leveled against you.

215
00:19:03,828 --> 00:19:09,425
Fortunately, as I've
intercepted this document,
there's no harm done.

216
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,867
God knows how
you're going to survive in
this world, Edmond Dantes.

217
00:19:12,937 --> 00:19:15,872
But you are no traitor.

218
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,534
You may go.

219
00:19:20,979 --> 00:19:23,004
Thank you, sir.

220
00:19:25,283 --> 00:19:30,744
Wait, uh, did Napoleon
tell you who's supposed
to pick up the letter?

221
00:19:30,822 --> 00:19:32,983
Monsieur Clarion.

222
00:19:33,057 --> 00:19:35,048
What name did you say?

223
00:19:37,228 --> 00:19:39,162
Monsieur Clarion.

224
00:19:40,565 --> 00:19:42,795
Have you mentioned
this name to anyone else?

225
00:19:42,867 --> 00:19:45,097
Monsieur Mondego
or anyone?

226
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:50,368
No, sir, in fact,
Monsieur Mondego knows
nothing of this letter.

227
00:19:55,346 --> 00:20:00,283
This is very
dangerous information.

228
00:20:00,351 --> 00:20:03,320
One can never be too careful
in times like this.

229
00:20:03,388 --> 00:20:06,448
- Don't you think?
- Yes, sir.

230
00:20:06,524 --> 00:20:08,924
Mm-hmm.

231
00:20:08,993 --> 00:20:12,520
I've given you rather
a stressful time.

232
00:20:12,597 --> 00:20:16,397
I wonder if, by way of an
apology, I could offer you
my carriage home.

- Monsieur?
- It's all right.
He's right here. Fernand!

248
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:15,918
I've been arrested for treason.
I barely managed to escape.

249
00:22:15,987 --> 00:22:18,615
When we were on Elba,
Napoleon gave me a letter.

250
00:22:18,689 --> 00:22:21,317
I didn't tell you because
he made me promise not to.

251
00:22:21,392 --> 00:22:23,326
He said it was just
some note to an old friend.

252
00:22:23,394 --> 00:22:25,919
But the bastard lied to me!
He lied.

253
00:22:25,997 --> 00:22:28,557
It was to one of his agents.

254
00:22:28,633 --> 00:22:31,534
Somehow the authorities found out.
I don't know what to do.

255
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:33,593
There's gendarmes on
horseback right behind me.

256
00:22:33,671 --> 00:22:36,834
All right.
We just have to think.

257
00:22:36,908 --> 00:22:38,842
I hope I haven't
compromised you.

258
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,935
I was hoping your father
could help me.

259
00:22:41,012 --> 00:22:43,310
He's in Paris.
He's very ill.

- How far back are the gendarmes?
- Minutes.

- Do you need money?
- Yes, thank you.

- Of course not.

Stop it, Fernand.
I don't have time for this.

265
00:23:01,432 --> 00:23:04,026
I saw Napoleon
give you that letter.

266
00:23:04,102 --> 00:23:06,935
It was you?

267
00:23:07,004 --> 00:23:09,700
Well, it wasn't just me.
It was Danglars's idea.

Why didn't you
come to me first?

Why did you keep it a secret from me?
I thought you were my friend.

270
00:23:15,847 --> 00:23:18,975
I told you I gave Napoleon my word.
He lied to me!

Now, you listen to me, Father.
I am the chief magistrate,
an official of the new regime.

298
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:57,605
I cannot afford to have

In the end, treason
is a matter of dates.

I shall be the patriot,
and you the traitor,
when the emperor returns.

Stop it. Stop it,

Those days are over.
Napoleon Bonaparte is no longer
the emperor of anything.

If you continue
to dabble in this lunacy,
you run an excellent chance...

of being arrested and ruining

is that as a family
our fates are intertwined.

309
00:26:33,277 --> 00:26:37,213
- Surely you can see that.
- See? Ah!

310
00:26:37,281 --> 00:26:40,182
I'm an old ruin.

00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,856
Welcome, Monsieur Dantes.

317
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:58,292
I am Armand Dorleac,
the warden of Chateau d'lf.

318
00:27:58,362 --> 00:28:03,459
Monsieur, I know you must
hear this a great deal,

319
00:28:03,534 --> 00:28:08,062
- but I assure you I am innocent.
- [Scoffs]

320
00:28:08,139 --> 00:28:10,767
Everyone must say that,
I know, but I truly am.

321
00:28:10,841 --> 00:28:13,571
- Innocent.
- Yes.

322
00:28:13,644 --> 00:28:16,613
I know. I really do know.

323
00:28:17,848 --> 00:28:22,114
- You mock me?
- No, my dear Dantes.

324
00:28:22,186 --> 00:28:27,453
I know perfectly well
that you are innocent.
Why else would you be here?

325
00:28:27,525 --> 00:28:31,052
- [Liquid Pouring]
- If you were truly guilty,

326
00:28:31,128 --> 00:28:35,656
there are a hundred prisons in France
where they would lock you away,

327
00:28:35,733 --> 00:28:41,137
but Chateau d'lf is where they
put the ones they're ashamed of.

328
00:28:44,642 --> 00:28:47,611
Let's have a look at
your quarters now, shall we?

329
00:29:03,727 --> 00:29:08,061
"God will give me justice."

330
00:29:08,132 --> 00:29:11,590
People are always trying
to motivate themselves.

331
00:29:11,669 --> 00:29:16,800
Or they keep calendars,
but soon they lose interest
or they die.

332
00:29:16,874 --> 00:29:20,901
- There's a window.
- All I'm left with is a rather
unsightly wall, I'm afraid.

333
00:29:20,978 --> 00:29:25,472
So I conceived of another way to help
our prisoners keep track of time.

334
00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:28,518
Every year, on the anniversary
of their imprisonment,

335
00:29:28,586 --> 00:29:30,679
we hurt them.

336
00:29:30,754 --> 00:29:33,416
Usually just
a simple beating really.

337
00:29:33,491 --> 00:29:38,394
Although, on their first day here,
in your case, today,

338
00:29:38,462 --> 00:29:40,862
I like to do
something rather special.

339

[Gasping]

And if you're
thinking just now,

00:29:47,304 --> 00:29:50,034
"Why me, O God?"

342
00:29:50,107 --> 00:29:54,976
- The answer is,
God has nothing to do with it.
- All right?

343
00:29:55,045 --> 00:29:58,378
In fact, God is never
in France this time of year.

344
00:29:58,449 --> 00:30:03,716
God has everything to do with it.
He's everywhere. He sees everything.

345
00:30:05,422 --> 00:30:07,356
All right.

346
00:30:09,026 --> 00:30:11,494
Let's make a bargain,
shall we?

347
00:30:11,562 --> 00:30:17,262
You ask God for help,
and I'll stop the moment he shows up.

Monsieur Villefort,
have you not heard?

351
00:30:36,554 --> 00:30:38,681
- Napoleon has escaped from Elba!
- What?

352

He marches on Paris!

353

Pack all my files.
And tell that idiot clerk
to find the ledger!

354
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,266
We are here to plead the case
of Edmond Dantes, Magistrate.

355
00:30:54,338 --> 00:30:55,999
Not now! Dantes?

356
00:30:56,073 --> 00:31:01,511
We have not met, monsieur.
I am Fernand Mondego,
the son of Count Mondego.

357
00:31:01,579 --> 00:31:04,707
I am here to swear
to Edmond Dantes's innocence.

358
00:31:04,782 --> 00:31:09,981
This is his employer,
Monsieur Morell, his father,
and his fiancee, Mercedes.

359
00:31:13,591 --> 00:31:16,788
Edmond Dantes is charged
with high treason.

360
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,328
- Yet you stand by him?
- Of course I do.

361
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:27,332
What if I was to tell you
that Dantes is also
charged with murder?

362
00:31:27,404 --> 00:31:31,238
- Murder?
- Edmond would never do such a thing.

363
00:31:31,308 --> 00:31:34,209
Dantes carried a letter from
Napoleon to one of his agents.

364
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:36,212
When we tried to arrest him,
he killed one of my men.

365
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,044
No, if you knew him,
monsieur, you would know
that was not possible.

366
00:31:39,116 --> 00:31:41,050
Have mercy, please.

367
00:31:41,118 --> 00:31:43,643
You have proof
of this treason?

368
00:31:43,721 --> 00:31:45,655
That is government business.

369
00:31:45,723 --> 00:31:49,659
Please. Please,
just tell us where he is.

370
00:31:49,727 --> 00:31:52,958
I cannot, mademoiselle.
He was handed over to the king's men.

371
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:56,227
I can understand your pain
at this betrayal.

372
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:01,397
But my advice to all of you
would be to forget Edmond Dantes,

373
00:32:01,472 --> 00:32:03,463
particularly you,
mademoiselle.

Take solace in the comfort
of your good friend here...

00:32:07,311 --> 00:32:12,339
and perhaps some good may yet come
of this unhappy affair.

376
00:32:12,416 --> 00:32:15,351
Now, you will excuse me.
I have to attend some other matters.

00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:16,750
My son is no traitor!

[Fernand]
I will try to reason with him.

379
00:32:19,056 --> 00:32:22,389
- Let's leave this to Fernand.
He can plead the case.
- It's impossible. Never.

380
00:32:22,459 --> 00:32:24,950
I will not give up
on Edmond yet.

381
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:27,759
I will never
forget your kindness.

And I shall never
cease to give it.

Not that I don't appreciate
the embroidery of the crimes,

but still, murder?

receiving the letter to me,

I didn't quite understand
why you were betraying him,

his exquisite fiancee,
I understand completely.

He did not believe that
I had no idea where it was.

So he had me thrown in here
to refresh my memory.

Did Napoleon tell you
who was supposed to
pick up this letter?

- I told him...
- A Monsieur Clarion.

My grandfather
isn't well, monsieur.

791
01:07:32,897 --> 01:07:36,298
Even if he were,
he would not receive visitors
at 11:00 in the evening.

792
01:07:36,367 --> 01:07:38,665
Perhaps he might make
an exception...

793
01:07:38,736 --> 01:07:41,398
for a man who is seeking
E-Edmond Dantes.

you were a friend
of Edmond?

- Monsieur Morell?
- Yes?

801
01:08:11,369 --> 01:08:14,964
You knew... Edmond also?

802
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:16,973
Like a son.

803
01:08:19,911 --> 01:08:24,211
I was hoping you could tell me where
to find his family.

804
01:08:24,282 --> 01:08:27,308
Unfortunately,
his father hanged himself...

805
01:08:27,385 --> 01:08:31,151
after learning
of Edmond's treason.

And...

01:08:38,863 --> 01:08:43,323
this...

810
01:08:43,401 --> 01:08:46,199
- Who accused him?
- Who knows?

811
01:08:46,271 --> 01:08:49,934
Monsieur Villefort,
the man who had Edmond arrested,

812
01:08:50,008 --> 01:08:52,670
left for Paris soon after
to take up the post...

of chief prosecutor.

814
01:08:54,779 --> 01:08:58,112
Of course, the shock of his father's
violent murder...

815
01:08:58,183 --> 01:09:00,777
may also have spurred
his departure.

816
01:09:02,153 --> 01:09:05,384
They were strange times.

817
01:09:05,456 --> 01:09:09,586
You seem to have fallen
on difficult times yourself, sir.

818
01:09:09,661 --> 01:09:13,358
After Edmond's death,
I reluctantly took on a partner.

- [Puts Bottle Down]
- One of my captains.

And then one day,

[Morell Sighs]

My fate is nothing
compared to Edmond's.

01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:30,377
Perhaps your luck
is about to change.

I shall search out
Edmond's fiancee.

826
01:09:36,888 --> 01:09:39,015
You mean
the Countess Mondego?

827
01:09:41,559 --> 01:09:43,993
- Countess?
- Yes.

828
01:09:44,062 --> 01:09:46,997
A month after poor Edmond
was arrested,

his best friend.

830

- Fernand.
- Yes, that's right.

831
01:09:53,071 --> 01:09:56,006
And with the death
of his father and brother in the war,

832
01:09:56,074 --> 01:09:58,941
Fernand became Count Mondego.

Yes. I must go.

- I'm sorry I was not more helpful.
- Oh, no.

what I needed to know.

Did you fall off the bed?

951
01:22:52,282 --> 01:22:57,015
After 13 years of sleeping
on a stone slab, I can't.

01:22:57,087 --> 01:23:00,181
Mi Maria.
Does that hurt?

953
01:23:02,793 --> 01:23:04,727
Did you come here
for a reason?

954
01:23:04,795 --> 01:23:07,320
Mondego has a son.

955
01:23:14,405 --> 01:23:17,738
- Albert wishes to talk with us.
- Not now!

Tell him I'm trying
to protect his inheritance.

957
01:23:20,477 --> 01:23:23,412
Are you afraid he's
going to squander his as you have yours?

958
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:27,348
I don't recall hearing your
complaints when I elevated you
from a fishmonger's daughter.

Please, I must finish this,
then I shall be going out.

May I remind you, my love,
that in Paris there are
mistresses aplenty,

961
01:23:32,756 --> 01:23:36,214
but you have
only one son.

- For God's sake, be brief.
- I will, Father.

Several of my friends
are going to Rome for two weeks

- I would like to accompany them.
- Rome?

- And no chaperons? You're only 15.
- Almost 16.

Make it my birthday present,
Father, please.

- I won't get into trouble.
- No.

969
01:23:58,015 --> 01:24:01,473
Of course he can go.
I could do with some peace

Who are you, and why
are you doing this?

- We are bad men, and for the money.
- My money is in my waistcoat.

01:25:39,082 --> 01:25:43,519
Not anymore.
Besides, it's not your money
we're interested in.

982

You are the only son
of Count Mondego, are you not?

Send your note and be damned.

I wish it were that easy,
but a note won't reach
your father for two weeks,

and then there's the endless
debates about whether
we killed you already.

986

No, a note just doesn't have the impact.
Perhaps if we send him your ring.

987
01:26:02,573 --> 01:26:05,167
Yes. My ring bears

of my kidnapping?

are less than reputable.

I could do.

I'm sure you would have done the same.

Your father will
be proud of you.

You must come to Paris
and meet my parents so they
may thank you in person.

- Not for another three weeks,

- He's foreign,

1100
01:34:45,128 --> 01:34:47,528

1101
01:34:47,597 --> 01:34:49,758
I hear he aided
your son.

1102
01:34:49,833 --> 01:34:53,496
- Why does he seek your counsel?
- Why should I tell you?

1103
01:34:53,570 --> 01:34:57,199
When my son
returned from Rome,

1104
01:34:57,273 --> 01:35:00,674
he mentioned he'd
heard Monte Cristo saying
he was expecting a shipment.

1105
01:35:00,744 --> 01:35:03,338
He also heard the words "gold"...

1106
01:35:03,413 --> 01:35:05,210
and "Spada."

1107

- You don't believe...

1108
01:35:10,153 --> 01:35:12,678
Monte Cristo has found
the treasure of Spada.

1109
01:35:12,756 --> 01:35:15,850
Not an hour ago,
he asked me to help him avoid
troublesome inspections...

1110
01:35:15,925 --> 01:35:18,393
on a shipment coming
from Marseilles.

- I could have him arrested.

Don't do that.
Let's just relieve him of it.

- How do you propose...
- I have an acquaintance
who deals in these matters.

1114
01:35:28,671 --> 01:35:31,265
Tell Monte Cristo
you'll get his shipment through Customs,

1115
01:35:31,341 --> 01:35:34,333
but that it will
have to stay in port overnight.

1116
01:35:34,410 --> 01:35:38,141
I shall have it removed
and taken to my old family
estate in Bouchon,

to beg the count...

to allow me to give
the birthday toast to Albert.

I was so insistent, and such
is the graciousness of our host,

that he reluctantly gave up
his fatherly right...

When I arrived
in the catacombs,

I watched as the criminals,
who tied Albert to a wall,

1141
01:37:05,535 --> 01:37:08,197
threatened to cut off
his finger and send it to his father...

02:00:06,444 --> 02:00:11,609
But now I must
explain something to you.

1407
02:00:11,683 --> 02:00:14,345
Where you really come from.

1408
02:00:14,419 --> 02:00:18,480
Albert, you are
the son of Edmond Dantes.

1409
02:00:25,096 --> 02:00:28,259
The man you know as
the Count of Monte Cristo.

1410
02:00:42,580 --> 02:00:44,605
Well, I'm afraid
it is true.

1411
02:00:44,682 --> 02:00:48,174
You are the walking proof
that your mother
was as much of a whore...

1412
02:00:48,253 --> 02:00:50,744
in her younger years
as she is today.

1413
02:00:50,822 --> 02:00:52,949
[Albert]
You...

1414
02:00:56,160 --> 02:00:58,185
You let me fight him?

1415
02:00:58,263 --> 02:01:01,061
It didn't do
any good though, did it?

1416
02:01:01,132 --> 02:01:03,760
Fernand, I beg you.
No more!

1417
02:01:03,835 --> 02:01:05,769
I want no more of this.

1418
02:01:07,138 --> 02:01:11,802
Just go.
Call it mercy.

1419
02:01:11,876 --> 02:01:13,867
Mercy, Fernand.

1420
02:01:20,151 --> 02:01:25,487
You've only got one shot,
and it will take
more than that to stop me.

1421
02:01:25,556 --> 02:01:29,151
Well, then I'd best
put it where it will do
the most damage.

1422
02:01:30,828 --> 02:01:33,126
[Albert]
No!

1423
02:01:33,197 --> 02:01:35,665
Mother! Mother!

1424
02:01:35,733 --> 02:01:39,430
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Look what I've done. Jacopo!

1425
02:01:43,174 --> 02:01:45,074
Hyah!

1426
02:01:49,914 --> 02:01:51,973
Once again, Zatarra,

1427
02:01:52,050 --> 02:01:54,382
God sees you out of
the corner of His eye.

1428
02:01:54,452 --> 02:01:56,386
She'll live.

1429
02:02:01,326 --> 02:02:02,759
[Whinnies]

1430
02:02:29,387 --> 02:02:31,855
- [Fernand] Edmond!
- [Whimpers]

1431
02:02:31,923 --> 02:02:34,949
Edmond!

1432
02:02:35,026 --> 02:02:38,792
Please don't go
out there. Don't.

1433
02:02:38,863 --> 02:02:40,956
Edmond, don't go.

1434
02:02:41,032 --> 02:02:44,627
You try.
Don't ever quit.

1435
02:02:44,702 --> 02:02:47,170
Zatarra,

1436
02:02:47,238 --> 02:02:50,366
you must end this.

1437
02:02:52,043 --> 02:02:55,501
Even the priest
will understand that.

1438
02:02:55,580 --> 02:02:59,676
- Edmond!
- [Mercedes Whispering]
Please don't leave.

1439
02:03:01,953 --> 02:03:04,717
Watch over your mother.

1440
02:03:24,409 --> 02:03:29,711
Now, I couldn't live in a world
where you have everything
and I have nothing.

1441
02:04:52,263 --> 02:04:53,924
[Groans]

1442
02:05:10,548 --> 02:05:13,210
What happened
to your mercy?

1443
02:05:13,284 --> 02:05:18,187
I'm a count,
not a saint.

1444
02:05:18,256 --> 02:05:21,919
[Panting]

1445
02:05:58,863 --> 02:06:03,357
You were right, priest.
You were right.

1446
02:06:05,069 --> 02:06:07,435
This I promise you...

1447
02:06:07,505 --> 02:06:11,874
and God:

1448
02:06:11,943 --> 02:06:15,106
All that was used
for vengeance...

1449
02:06:15,179 --> 02:06:19,445
will now be used for good.

1450
02:06:19,517 --> 02:06:23,749
So rest in peace, my friend.

1451
02:06:23,821 --> 02:06:27,052
So, Zatarra,

1452
02:06:27,124 --> 02:06:29,285
painful, huh?

1453
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:32,193
No.

1454
02:06:37,668 --> 02:06:42,833
I bought this place,
thinking one day
I would tear it down.

1455
02:06:42,907 --> 02:06:45,569
But now the only things
I care about...

1456
02:06:45,643 --> 02:06:50,080
are walking off
this island with me.

1457
02:06:50,147 --> 02:06:52,980
Let's go home.
