00:09:20,178 --> 00:09:21,736
You other brothers...

160
00:09:21,714 --> 00:09:23,045
Hey, boss. Big Butts. [chuckles]

161
00:09:24,754 --> 00:09:26,915
Oi vey!

162
00:09:26,896 --> 00:09:31,595
Long story short, from now on
you work for Frankie and Lenny.

163
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:33,405
- Capiche?
- [Sykes laughs]

164
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,848
Lenny? Frankie, l understand.
But Lenny? You can't be serious.

165
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,749
l'm dead serious.
lt takes more than muscle to run things.

166
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:43,560
Now Lenny, he's got the brains.
That's somethin' special.

167
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:45,867
- He's special all right.
- What does that mean?

168
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:48,564
- Nothing. l'm just sayin'...
- l bring you in here,

169
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:51,752
look you in the eye,
tell you what's what, and what?

170
00:09:51,688 --> 00:09:53,622
- What?
- What ''what''?

171
00:09:53,607 --> 00:09:55,131
You said ''what'' first.

172
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:57,112
l didn't say what,
l asked you what.

173
00:09:57,095 --> 00:09:59,222
You said ''And then, what?''
l said ''What?''

174
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:02,005
No, l said ''what what'', like what what?

175
00:10:02,565 --> 00:10:05,261
- You said ''what'' first.
- Now you're making fun of me?

176
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,744
No, you misunderstood.

177
00:10:06,757 --> 00:10:07,825
Sorry we're late, Pop.
Lenny had an accident. He was born.

178
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:10,407
Sorry we're late, Pop.
Lenny had an accident. He was born.

179
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,736
[sarcastic laugh] You're a comic genius.

180
00:10:12,706 --> 00:10:15,539
Look, all l'm saying is
the kid ain't exactly no killer.

181
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:19,858
My Lenny is a killer. You hear me?
A cold-blooded killer. Look at him.

182
00:10:23,102 --> 00:10:24,763
Huh?

183
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:29,319
That's it! That's it! You are out!

184
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:32,442
What?
[high-pitched] Whaddya mean l'm ''out?''

185
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,348
- You're fired.
- [Sykes screams]

186
00:10:35,771 --> 00:10:38,604
And on top of that,
you're gonna have to start payin' me.

187
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,748
For what?

188
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:42,397
So nothing happens
to your little Whale Wash.

189
00:10:42,457 --> 00:10:44,448
[Oscar] Welcome to Oscar's crib.

190
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,742
60-foot slime-covered tongue
with canker sores, swim-in cavities,

191
00:10:49,591 --> 00:10:52,958
and plankton-encrusted teeth
for when l feel a bit... [grunts]

192
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,877
old school.

193
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:58,101
Stop your moaning, Oscar.
lt could be a lot worse, you know.

194
00:10:58,036 --> 00:11:01,938
That's true. l could have this job
and look like you. [laughs]

195
00:11:01,843 --> 00:11:04,778
Who's behind me? Whoever's behind me
better give me some.

196
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:06,348
[rumbling]

197
00:11:08,593 --> 00:11:12,962
lndigestion. She's gonna blow!

198
00:11:12,848 --> 00:11:15,510
Wait! Headphone Guy is still in there!

199
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:16,995
[dance music]

200
00:11:17,006 --> 00:11:21,568
l got you, Headphone Guy!

201
00:11:25,707 --> 00:11:27,572
[belch]

202
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:28,996
[laughs]

203
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:34,744
- Still think it could be worse?
- Yeah. l could look like you.

204
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,051
Y'all funny.
Well, see if you laugh at this.

205
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,709
[whale moans]

206
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,094
Soap in the eye! Soap in the eye!

207
00:11:55,171 --> 00:11:57,503
lt's all right.
l'll get you some coupons,

208
00:11:57,474 --> 00:12:00,136
a free hot wax and all that.
You like that?

209
00:12:00,097 --> 00:12:02,657
- All right, go ahead, big baby.
- Thanks, Oscar.

210
00:12:02,624 --> 00:12:03,613
All right.

211
00:12:03,648 --> 00:12:07,015
- Well, look who it is, Bernie.
- Just the fish we're looking for.

212
00:12:06,944 --> 00:12:09,344
The boss be needin' to see you
right now.

213
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,541
- Right now.
- Ernie. Bernie.

214
00:12:11,517 --> 00:12:13,348
My jellyfish brothers. Boo-ya-ka.

215
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:17,038
Hey, what's up, man?
Man, it's good to see y'all... Huh?

216
00:12:16,955 --> 00:12:19,389
What'd you say, Ang? Okay.

217
00:12:19,355 --> 00:12:21,414
Fellas, l'm gonna go ahead over there.

218
00:12:21,402 --> 00:12:23,427
But don't worry

219
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:26,147
[beatbox] About a thing

220
00:12:27,737 --> 00:12:30,672
'Cause every little thing
Is gonna be all right...

221
00:12:30,615 --> 00:12:33,140
That's not the way
you sing that song, mon.

222
00:12:33,846 --> 00:12:35,211
[shrieks]

223
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:42,774
Sykes, my brother from another mother.
What the deezy, baby?

224
00:12:42,644 --> 00:12:45,010
Show me dat.
What's goin' down?

225
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:48,938
Hey, baby, this is all gravy today.
Now snap your fin... Snap it.

226
00:12:48,849 --> 00:12:50,840
- You're not snappin' it...
- Oscar.

227
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,427
Hey, don't sweat it.
A lot of white fish can't do it.

228
00:12:53,392 --> 00:12:55,826
- Would you just sit down, okay?
- Thank you.

229
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,988
l've been goin' over my markers.
You're into me for five grand.

230
00:12:58,926 --> 00:13:02,259
- 5 G's, okay?
- 5 G's? Man, you trippin'? 5 G's.

231
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,715
Oh, yeah?
See if this refreshes your memory.

232
00:13:06,124 --> 00:13:08,422
That's crazy, look at that.

233
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:12,264
You wrote everything down
so you wouldn't forget.

234
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:16,197
This a perfect example of why
you're in management, and l'm not.

235
00:13:16,105 --> 00:13:17,094
You go, boy.

236
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,963
l have to pay Don Lino protection,
so everything you owe me, you owe him.

237
00:13:20,872 --> 00:13:23,568
- How you figure that?
- Simple. The food chain.

238
00:13:23,527 --> 00:13:27,019
See, on top there's Don Lino.
There's me, and there's regular fish.

239
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:28,509
- That's me.
- No.

240
00:13:29,222 --> 00:13:31,383
There's plankton, there's amoebas...

241
00:13:31,364 --> 00:13:33,457
- Then there's me?
- l'm gettin' there.

242
00:13:33,443 --> 00:13:37,903
There's coral, there's rocks, there's
whale pooh, and then there's you.

243
00:13:37,794 --> 00:13:39,421
That's messed up.

244
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:42,055
So if Don Lino's squeezin' me,
he's squeezin' you.

245
00:13:42,017 --> 00:13:43,917
- What?
- Oscar.

246
00:13:43,905 --> 00:13:44,963
Sorry.

247
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:47,586
- Easy, boss, find your happy place.
- Happy place.

248
00:13:47,552 --> 00:13:50,851
There is no happy place with him here.
[high-pitched] l'm serious.

249
00:13:50,783 --> 00:13:53,274
Okay, please.
Please, just gimme some time.

250
00:13:53,246 --> 00:13:57,808
That's all l'm asking.
l'm begging you, Sykes. Please. Please.

251
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,938
All right.

252
00:14:01,915 --> 00:14:05,282
'Cause l like you,
l'm gonna give you 24 hours to pay up.

253
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:07,404
All of it?
How am l supposed to do that?

254
00:14:07,384 --> 00:14:11,150
That's your problem. Bring my 5,000
clams to the track tomorrow, or else.

255
00:14:11,065 --> 00:14:13,795
- Or else what?
- The boys'll explain.

256
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:15,742
[both laugh]

257
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:18,839
- [sizzling]
- [Oscar] Unpleasant.

258
00:14:18,869 --> 00:14:22,100
[Angie] 5,000 clams?

259
00:14:22,037 --> 00:14:26,371
You borrowed 5,000 clams
from Mr. Sykes?

260
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:30,195
Oscar, why do you get yourself
into these situations?

261
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:32,932
l don't know, Ang.

262
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,908
lt's just hard, all right,
because l'm a little fish in a big pond.

263
00:14:37,775 --> 00:14:40,710
A really big pond.
The ocean.

264
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:46,799
l'm a nobody.
l want some of that.

265
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:48,826
- Mrs. Sanchez?
- What?

266
00:14:48,813 --> 00:14:51,839
It's ladies' night,
Oh, what a night...

267
00:14:51,788 --> 00:14:54,052
Ew. No. That.

268
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:58,999
The top of the reef.
Where the somebodies live.

269
00:14:59,434 --> 00:15:04,497
l wanna be rich and famous like them,
but l'm stuck down here.

270
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,796
Well, what's wrong with down here?

271
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:10,051
l'll tell you what's wrong
with down here.

272
00:15:10,021 --> 00:15:14,185
Remember my dad?
He worked at the Wash his whole life.

273
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:17,474
Ooh, child...

274
00:15:17,444 --> 00:15:20,538
[Oscar]
He was the number one tongue scrubber.

275
00:15:20,867 --> 00:15:23,859
Every year for 25 years.

276
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:31,704
To me, working at the Wash
was the coolest job in the ocean.

277
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:36,127
But then I learned something
I will never forget.

278
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,430
Oscar's dad's a tongue scrubber!

279
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:40,627
Tongue scrubber! Tongue scrubber!

280
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:44,735
Tongue scrubber! Tongue scrubber!
Tongue scrubber! Tongue scrubber!

281
00:15:46,331 --> 00:15:48,322
My dad was the greatest.

282
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:51,716
But nobody loves a nobody.

283
00:15:53,017 --> 00:15:55,178
l want to be a somebody.

284
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:00,826
Oscar , you don't have to live
at the top of the reef to be a somebody.

285
00:16:00,661 --> 00:16:02,094
[grunts]

286
00:16:02,774 --> 00:16:06,835
What's the difference? lf l don't pay
Mr. Sykes back by tomorrow,...

287
00:16:06,741 --> 00:16:08,675
l'm dead anyway, so...

288
00:16:11,218 --> 00:16:13,209
Wait here.

289
00:16:24,462 --> 00:16:25,986
What's this?

290
00:16:28,174 --> 00:16:30,938
- A pink pearl?
- Mm-hm.

291
00:16:30,893 --> 00:16:32,690
Where'd you get that?

292
00:16:32,685 --> 00:16:34,676
My grandmother gave it to me.

293
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:40,499
She said it started
from a tiny grain of sand,

294
00:16:40,363 --> 00:16:45,699
but then, after a while,
it grew into something beautiful.

295
00:16:47,687 --> 00:16:49,621
Dreams can begin small too.

296
00:16:49,607 --> 00:16:53,008
- No. No, l couldn't...
- Take it.

297
00:16:52,935 --> 00:16:56,132
lt'll get you the money you need
for Mr. Sykes.

298
00:17:01,027 --> 00:17:04,656
What do you mean, you don't understand?
We've been over it 1 ,000 times.

299
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,570
l don't want to have to say it again.

300
00:17:06,562 --> 00:17:09,929
You're really giving me agita.
l don't know how else to say this.

301
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:13,225
You see something,
you kill it, you eat it. Period. Thanks.

302
00:17:13,152 --> 00:17:16,019
That's what sharks do.
That's a fine tradition.

303
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:19,961
What's the matter with you? Your
brother Frankie, here, he's a killer.

304
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,531
- Thanks, Pop.
- He's beautiful.

305
00:17:21,533 --> 00:17:24,866
He does what he's supposed to do.
Wipe your face.

306
00:17:24,797 --> 00:17:28,824
But you... l'm hearin' things.

307
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:32,827
You gotta understand, when you
look weak it makes me look weak.

308
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,961
- l can't have that.
- l know, Pop, l'm sorry.

309
00:17:35,896 --> 00:17:38,956
Lenny. Lenny. Look at me.
Look at me.

310
00:17:38,936 --> 00:17:42,201
This handin' over the business,
it's for you, for both of yous,

311
00:17:42,136 --> 00:17:44,730
and you're acting
like you don't even want it.

312
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,603
l need to know that
you can handle that.

313
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:49,865
[sighs]

314
00:17:51,316 --> 00:17:52,340
[splutters]

315
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:56,240
All right. Right here,
in front of me now, eat this.

316
00:17:56,147 --> 00:17:59,776
- [whimpers]
- Yeah. Gee, thanks, Pop.

317
00:17:59,698 --> 00:18:01,097
Here's the thing.

318
00:18:01,105 --> 00:18:05,542
l'm on a diet. l read an article about
these shrimps. They're not good for ya.

319
00:18:05,423 --> 00:18:09,416
You know how many calories
are in one of those shrimps?

320
00:18:09,327 --> 00:18:10,316
A lot.

321
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,716
lt's true.
lt's true and the other thing is,

322
00:18:12,686 --> 00:18:16,918
my sister had a baby and l took it over
because she passed away

323
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:19,838
and then the baby lost its legs
and its arms

324
00:18:19,787 --> 00:18:23,518
and now it's nothing but a stump
but l still take care of it with my wife

325
00:18:23,434 --> 00:18:27,871
and it's growing and it's fairly happy,

326
00:18:27,753 --> 00:18:31,587
but it's difficult 'cause l've been
working a second shift at the factory

327
00:18:31,495 --> 00:18:33,486
to put food on the table,

328
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:38,542
but all the love l see in that little
guy's face makes it worth it in the end.

329
00:18:40,325 --> 00:18:42,418
True story.

330
00:18:42,404 --> 00:18:46,067
- [sobs]
- [sighs]

331
00:18:45,987 --> 00:18:49,115
l'm not askin' you anymore.
l'm tellin' you. Eat it!

332
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:51,289
- No. Have mercy.
- Pop, please...

333
00:18:51,266 --> 00:18:52,528
- Eat!
- No eat.

334
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:54,911
Son, eat the shrimp!

335
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,347
No, please.

336
00:18:56,352 --> 00:18:59,480
- Lenny! Eat, eat, eat!
- Don't! Pop!

337
00:18:59,423 --> 00:19:01,857
Put the shrimp down!

338
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:06,463
Go now. No one's looking.
Get out of here.

339
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,694
- You're free, now go.
- Thank you.

340
00:19:08,668 --> 00:19:11,193
You're a good person.

341
00:19:15,258 --> 00:19:17,055
Come on, fellas.

342
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,688
Pop, l can handle the reef.
lt's not a problem.

343
00:19:25,655 --> 00:19:28,522
No. We're gonna do this as a family.

344
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:31,372
Frankie, l want you to take Lenny out,
show him the ropes.

345
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:34,514
- Come on, Pop.
- You're gonna learn how to be a shark.

346
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,699
Whether you like it or not.

347
00:19:36,692 --> 00:19:37,526
[bell rings]

348
00:19:37,492 --> 00:19:38,982
[bell rings]

349
00:19:40,627 --> 00:19:41,787
[cheering]

350
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,903
That kid better show up
or he's dead meat.

351
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,448
Just say the word, boss.

352
00:19:45,457 --> 00:19:49,416
Carrying a big ol' envelope full of
money, gonna give it to Mr. Sykes.

353
00:19:49,328 --> 00:19:52,058
Hurry up. This is our chance,
we don't want to miss it.

354
00:19:52,014 --> 00:19:54,847
- You sure?
- My trainer friend tipped me off.

355
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:57,596
The race is rigged. We can't lose.

356
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:01,008
- What's the horse's name?
- Lucky Day.

357
00:20:00,941 --> 00:20:03,501
[speakers]...Lucky Day, at 200 to 1.

358
00:20:03,466 --> 00:20:06,492
- We're gonna be rich!
- Rich!

359
00:20:06,443 --> 00:20:09,708
Top of the reef, here l come.

360
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:11,200
No, wait. What am l doing?

361
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:14,235
Remember what Angie said.
Remember what Angie said.

362
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:15,947
What did Angie say?

363
00:20:15,943 --> 00:20:18,002
Dreams can begin small.

364
00:20:17,991 --> 00:20:21,893
You just have to... bet it all.
Bet it all!

365
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:25,030
[commentator] And Lucky Day wins.

366
00:20:24,965 --> 00:20:26,956
[rap music]

367
00:20:30,371 --> 00:20:32,965
Five thousand on Lucky Day to win.

368
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:35,957
That's 200 to one.
That would pay a million clams.

369
00:20:35,904 --> 00:20:40,238
Well , l guess that makes me
Oscar the millionaire.

370
00:20:40,129 --> 00:20:40,529
[echoes] The millionaire.

371
00:20:40,511 --> 00:20:42,103
[echoes] The millionaire.

372
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,894
Lucky Day. Lucky Day.

373
00:20:50,173 --> 00:20:52,767
She's dangerous, super bad

374
00:20:52,732 --> 00:20:54,723
Better watch out, she'll take the cash

375
00:20:54,715 --> 00:20:59,345
She's a gold digger
She's a gold digger

376
00:20:59,226 --> 00:21:01,956
She's dangerous, super bad

377
00:21:01,913 --> 00:21:03,972
Better watch out, she'll take the cash

378
00:21:03,961 --> 00:21:05,223
She's a gold digger...

379
00:21:05,241 --> 00:21:07,232
Nice bet.

380
00:21:11,862 --> 00:21:13,193
[chuckles]

381
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,106
- You got a name?
- [chuckles]

382
00:21:16,052 --> 00:21:18,782
- You wanna tell me what it is?
- [chuckles]

383
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,174
Well, mine's Lola.

384
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:23,945
C'mon, man! Get your game face on!

385
00:21:23,924 --> 00:21:25,255
[yelps]

386
00:21:26,258 --> 00:21:30,786
So,... [chuckles] Lola, my name's...

387
00:21:31,376 --> 00:21:34,072
My name is Oscar, sweetie.

388
00:21:34,032 --> 00:21:35,624
[gasps] Mrs. Sanchez.

389
00:21:35,632 --> 00:21:39,124
The hippity-hop smooth talk
don't work with me.

390
00:21:39,054 --> 00:21:41,045
My bad. Hey, so...

391
00:21:41,037 --> 00:21:43,733
Oscar. l was starting to think
you skipped out on me.

392
00:21:43,692 --> 00:21:47,628
Sykes! l see you're already on your way
to the concession stand.

393
00:21:47,531 --> 00:21:48,862
What are you doing?

394
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:52,208
Mind bringing us back some drinks?
That would be great, thanks.

395
00:21:52,137 --> 00:21:54,332
And some of them
little wiener thingies.

396
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,339
- The ones with the toothpicks?
- Don't listen to him.

397
00:21:57,288 --> 00:22:00,780
- Let me escort you to... my box.
- Your box?!

398
00:22:00,711 --> 00:22:03,612
His box?! You can't even afford
the gum under the seats.

399
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:08,996
He just laid five grand on Lucky Day.
l think he can afford anything he wants.

400
00:22:09,508 --> 00:22:13,410
- Five grand? My five grand?!
- No, it was another five grand.

401
00:22:13,315 --> 00:22:15,977
You had the money to pay me back
and you bet it anyway?

402
00:22:15,938 --> 00:22:17,872
- Hold up.
- Gimme that!

403
00:22:17,857 --> 00:22:20,690
- Clearly l've made a mistake.
- No, no, wait! Lola!

404
00:22:20,641 --> 00:22:24,042
Look. Deep down, l'm really superficial.

405
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:29,099
And don't get me wrong, you're cute,
but... you're a nobody.

406
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:33,590
Oscar, you cute, but you're a nobody.

407
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:35,493
[Ernie] Wait. Lola. Come back.

408
00:22:35,485 --> 00:22:38,716
l'm not a nobody. l'm a wiener.

409
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:40,219
[Ernie and Bernie laugh]

410
00:22:40,155 --> 00:22:43,090
You are unbelievable.
You're in trouble up to your gills

411
00:22:43,033 --> 00:22:45,900
and still you're askin' for more.
Now go on, get in here.

412
00:22:45,913 --> 00:22:49,110
Oscar, you better pray
that this horse of yours comes through.

413
00:22:49,048 --> 00:22:51,039
Bettin' my five thousand.

414
00:22:51,032 --> 00:22:53,432
Hey. Outta my seat.
You, outta my seat.

415
00:22:53,398 --> 00:22:54,922
Unbelievable.

416
00:22:54,934 --> 00:22:59,064
- Sit tight and watch the race.
- With your good eye.

417
00:22:58,966 --> 00:23:00,331
[Ernie] Good eye.

418
00:23:00,341 --> 00:23:03,572
[announcer] The horses are
at the post. And they're off!

419
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:06,068
Fish Fingers, then Seabiscuit
and Salmonella.

420
00:23:06,035 --> 00:23:09,095
Lucky Day seems to be having trouble
getting out of the gate.

421
00:23:09,043 --> 00:23:11,511
- What?
- Only a sucker would bet on that horse.

422
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:14,499
Don't sweat it.
He does this all the time. He's playin'.

423
00:23:14,448 --> 00:23:18,248
What's this? Lucky Day is now
crashing his way through the gate,

424
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,820
and he's off and running.

425
00:23:19,823 --> 00:23:21,415
Seabiscuit, Fish Fingers...

426
00:23:21,422 --> 00:23:24,357
Please, Lucky Day.
Go fast.

427
00:23:24,877 --> 00:23:29,314
Coming around the turn it's Seabiscuit
by a length and Lucky Day well behind.

428
00:23:29,195 --> 00:23:30,856
And here comes Lucky Day,

429
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:34,819
coming up from behind,
passing Yellow Tail, Salmonella.

430
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,857
You see? Who's your fish now? Go.

431
00:23:36,841 --> 00:23:39,366
Around the final turn,
here comes Lucky Day.

432
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:41,634
Lucky Day's now caught up
to Fish Fingers.

433
00:23:41,608 --> 00:23:44,736
They're head to head. Neck to neck.
Lucky Day's ahead.

434
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,843
l'm tired just thinkin'
about countin' all of this money.

435
00:23:47,782 --> 00:23:51,081
- Look at Lucky Day go.
-  We're movin' on up

436
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,742
To the eastside...

437
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:58,110
[Commentator] Absolutely amazing!
This looks to be Lucky Day's big day.

438
00:23:57,954 --> 00:24:00,184
It's Lucky Day.

439
00:24:01,058 --> 00:24:02,548
[thud]

440
00:24:03,682 --> 00:24:07,482
What happened?
Lucky Day is down.

441
00:24:08,385 --> 00:24:11,047
We're movin' on up to the east...

442
00:24:11,007 --> 00:24:13,475
No.

443
00:24:13,438 --> 00:24:15,463
[rumbling, loud thud]

444
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,685
Here's Fish Fingers,
followed by Seabiscuit, Yellow Tail...

445
00:24:18,621 --> 00:24:22,682
- And Fish Fingers wins.
- Wait. l just want to hold you.

446
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:24,953
No, Get outta my way.
Let me see, will ya?

447
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,890
Remember your ''happy place'', Sykes.

448
00:24:26,874 --> 00:24:29,502
That's why they call him a long shot.

449
00:24:29,465 --> 00:24:31,933
Yo, that was crazy, right? Who knew?

450
00:24:31,896 --> 00:24:35,263
Everything's set, it's a lock,
we good to go, we in the money,

451
00:24:35,191 --> 00:24:37,785
and he trips underwater.

452
00:24:37,751 --> 00:24:41,243
Who in the halibut trips underwater?

453
00:24:41,174 --> 00:24:44,632
- And by the way, on what?
- That's it. That's it, l've had it.

454
00:24:44,564 --> 00:24:48,125
[high-pitched] Ernie. Bernie.
Find the deepest hole in the ocean

455
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:51,612
and when you do, dig deeper.
And put him in it.

456
00:24:52,114 --> 00:24:53,809
[wails]

457
00:24:55,985 --> 00:24:59,751
Sorry, kid. lt's nothing personal.
lt's just business.

458
00:25:04,729 --> 00:25:07,289
Don't worry

459
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,246
About a thing

460
00:25:10,901 --> 00:25:13,131
'Cause every little thing

Yeah, mon? Go on.

467
00:25:29,584 --> 00:25:32,451
Why is it that me locks
can sting other people,

468
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,664
but they have no effect on me or you?

469
00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:36,163

Ernie, you made a joke.
Good one, man. Respect.

473

Bloodfire.

474
00:25:50,762 --> 00:25:53,060
[Lenny]
Frankie, you know l can't do this.

475
00:25:53,032 --> 00:25:56,024
[Frankie] lf you wanna make Pop happy,
you've gotta kill something.

476
00:25:55,976 --> 00:25:58,410
[Lenny] Or, l could find an old, sick
fish and just wait.

477
00:25:58,376 --> 00:26:01,072
[Frankie] lt's gettin' around,

478
00:26:01,031 --> 00:26:03,022
You know how fish talk.

This, that, the other. How you doin'?
Boom. Forget it, you're dead.

Okay, seriously, l can't understand
wise guy so be more specific.

481
00:26:11,204 --> 00:26:14,731
Specific? You want specific?
Be a shark for once in your life.

482
00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:18,686
- What am l gonna do?
- Lenny, forget about it, okay?

483
00:26:18,593 --> 00:26:22,154
We do a couple of practice runs,
badda-bing badda-boom, Pop's happy,

488
00:26:34,268 --> 00:26:37,601
All right. Come on.
Eye of the tiger.

489
00:26:37,531 --> 00:26:41,297
Frankie, l can do this.
What if l can't do this?

490
00:26:41,211 --> 00:26:44,908
- Then don't bother comin' home.
- Good point. All right.

491
00:26:44,826 --> 00:26:47,386
Hit him in the tail again.

Guys? Guys? Don't leave me alone.

00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:40,441
That's it. Wave those fins, baby.
Dig in.

510
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:43,384
[snarls] Look, l'm just pretending
so you can get away.

511
00:27:43,336 --> 00:27:45,304
Now, when l turn around, you take off.

512
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,981
Tastes just like chicken.

513
00:27:47,974 --> 00:27:49,601
Mmm. Mmm.

514
00:27:49,606 --> 00:27:50,937

00:27:57,923 --> 00:27:59,584
[snarls]

519
00:28:00,963 --> 00:28:02,988
- Oh, no.

520
00:28:02,978 --> 00:28:06,277
- No, Frankie, wait.
- No! Get your boy, get your boy!

521
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:10,225

[distant rumbling]

523
00:28:20,859 --> 00:28:22,918
[gasps] Frankie.

524
00:28:27,577 --> 00:28:29,238
- [thud]

525
00:28:30,424 --> 00:28:31,550
[coughs]

526
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:34,171
- Lenny, is that you?

527
00:28:34,136 --> 00:28:36,536
- Come closer.
- Yes, what is it?

528
00:28:36,503 --> 00:28:37,902
l'm so cold.

529
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:40,640
That's just because we're cold-blooded.

530
00:28:40,918 --> 00:28:44,012
- Ow!
- Moron.

531
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:46,891
Frankie, no...

532
00:28:47,988 --> 00:28:50,320
[wails] No!

533
00:28:52,275 --> 00:28:54,436
This is all my fault.

534
00:28:54,417 --> 00:28:57,352
l'm so sorry, Frankie.

535
00:28:58,255 --> 00:29:01,918
How am l ever
going to explain this to Pop?

536
00:29:01,838 --> 00:29:04,739
- [sobs] Oh, no.

537
00:29:08,812 --> 00:29:10,473
[shrieks]

542
00:29:25,447 --> 00:29:29,907
Don't hurt us. We're sorry.
lt was all Ernie's idea.

543
00:29:32,581 --> 00:29:35,641
Oscar. Did you kill that shark?

544
00:29:40,099 --> 00:29:42,727
Uh... yeah.

545
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,988
Exactly how it look,
that's how it is.

546
00:29:44,962 --> 00:29:46,327
What happened?

547
00:29:46,337 --> 00:29:48,669
You wanna know what happened?

548
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,938
Yeah. You're standing on top of a shark.

549
00:29:50,911 --> 00:29:52,071
Go on, man.

550
00:29:52,095 --> 00:29:54,154
Well, l'll tell you what happened.

551
00:29:54,847 --> 00:29:58,339
Big ol' shark,
about 75, 1 00-feet long.

552
00:29:58,269 --> 00:30:00,931
- So he's swimming at me, right?
- [crowd gasp]

553
00:30:00,892 --> 00:30:03,383
- With teeth like razors.
- Razors.

554
00:30:03,357 --> 00:30:05,917
And l was, like,
you're gonna come at me like that?

555
00:30:05,884 --> 00:30:09,115
You're gonna come
at the ''O'' like that?

556
00:30:09,051 --> 00:30:11,281
Do the muscle thing, the muscle thing.

557
00:30:11,257 --> 00:30:12,485
Oh, right.

558
00:30:12,505 --> 00:30:15,702
So l told that dude, ''You see this guy?''
and l pointed like this.

559
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,803
Well, he's got a brother.
And he lives right over here.

560
00:30:18,743 --> 00:30:23,407
And l think it's time
for a little family reunion.

561
00:30:23,285 --> 00:30:25,776
- [laughs]
- [crowd cheer]

562
00:30:25,844 --> 00:30:28,404
You see, mon. l told you.
We were right there.

563
00:30:28,371 --> 00:30:29,633
[lady fish] Pardon me.

564
00:30:29,652 --> 00:30:31,552
- Move it!
- Oh. Sorry.

565
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:34,737
- She seems so nice on TV.
- Oscar, Katie Current.

566
00:30:34,674 --> 00:30:38,132
As the first fish in history to ever
take on a shark and win, tell me:

567
00:30:38,065 --> 00:30:41,660
Does this mean you're now protector
of the reef, new sheriff in town?

568
00:30:41,584 --> 00:30:43,814
Katie, l'm gonna keep it real.

569
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,553
- l can call you Katie?
- Of course.

570
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:50,180
Any shark try to mess around
in Oscartown is goin' down.

571
00:30:50,062 --> 00:30:52,053
[roaring]

572
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:56,282
Yeah, it's poetic.
In the heat I get poetic.

573
00:30:56,236 --> 00:30:58,295
Oscar. Hmm.

574
00:30:58,474 --> 00:31:00,135
Oscar.

575
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:05,526
Get out of here, you barracudas. Any
further questions will be fielded by me.

576
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:07,281
- And you are?
- l'm his manager.

577
00:31:07,271 --> 00:31:10,638
- Sykes, with a ''y''.
- And l'm his financial advisor.

578
00:31:13,415 --> 00:31:15,406
You want to see my puppets?

579
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:18,836
[raspy voice] Hello.

580
00:31:18,821 --> 00:31:21,790
Could you excuse us
for a moment, please?

581
00:31:21,732 --> 00:31:23,757
- My manager?
- Kid, you're a superstar.

582
00:31:23,747 --> 00:31:26,409
- We're gonna make a fortune.
- What about the 5 G's?

583
00:31:26,371 --> 00:31:28,635
Forget the 5 G's.
We're partners now.

584
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:31,977
- So what are we talking about?
- l'm thinkin' 90-1 0 split?

585
00:31:31,905 --> 00:31:34,135
- That's generous.
- You're the 1 0, l'm 90.

586
00:31:34,112 --> 00:31:35,636
- l don't think so.
- Talk to me.

587
00:31:35,647 --> 00:31:36,807
- You get 1 5.
- 70.

588
00:31:36,832 --> 00:31:37,821
- 20.
- 75.

589
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:39,846
Dude, you're goin' the wrong way.

590
00:31:39,837 --> 00:31:40,826
50-50.

591
00:31:40,862 --> 00:31:41,954
- You happy?
- No. You?

592
00:31:41,981 --> 00:31:43,278
- No.
- Deal.

593
00:31:47,068 --> 00:31:50,265
My manager and l are now prepared
to take your questions.

594
00:31:50,203 --> 00:31:53,263
Oscar, are you going to continue
working here at the Wash?

595
00:31:53,209 --> 00:31:55,575
Please, l barely work here now.

596
00:31:55,545 --> 00:31:57,536
Keep it up, kid. You're slayin' 'em.

597
00:31:57,529 --> 00:31:59,588
No. He's slayin' sharks.

598
00:31:59,576 --> 00:32:01,771
Hey, that's good.
That's good, l like that.

599
00:32:01,752 --> 00:32:03,617
Oscar the Sharkslayer.

600
00:32:03,606 --> 00:32:05,836
Whoa! A sharkslayer.

601
00:32:05,814 --> 00:32:07,645
[Katie] You heard it here first.

602
00:32:07,637 --> 00:32:12,097
From now on, any shark tries
to bother this reef, it's his funeral.

603
00:32:17,843 --> 00:32:21,904
[shark] Nomine Patri, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti.

604
00:32:23,824 --> 00:32:29,091
I could fly higher than an eagle

605
00:32:30,765 --> 00:32:35,464
If you are the wind beneath my wings

606
00:32:35,341 --> 00:32:37,332
[coughs]

607
00:32:37,323 --> 00:32:41,282
- Frankie, we'll miss you.
- [All] To Frankie.

608
00:32:42,411 --> 00:32:46,711
lt's a terrible thing, Don Lino.
Everybody loved Frankie.

609
00:32:46,602 --> 00:32:49,901
May whoever did this
die a thousand deaths.

610
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:54,736
May his stinking, maggot-covered
corpse rot in the fiery depths of hell.

611
00:32:56,102 --> 00:32:59,936
Thank you for your kind thoughts,
Giuseppe.

612
00:32:59,846 --> 00:33:04,874
Oh, and may Lenny be found safe
and sound too. Hope he's okay.
