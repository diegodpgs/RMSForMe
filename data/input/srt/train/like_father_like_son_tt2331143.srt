00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:28,335
<i>Come in.</i>

2
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:29,670
<i>Thank you.</i>

3
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:32,601
November

4
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:37,610
Please, tell me your name,

5
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,773
age and date of birth.

6
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,322
My name is Nonomiya Keita,
and I am six years old.

7
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:48,083
My birthday is on
the 28th of July.

8
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:51,590
Whom do you think
Keita resembles most,

9
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:53,626
his father, or his mother?

10
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,791
It'd seem to my wife,
for her mild temper

11
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,799
and her kindness to others.

12
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,770
Does he have any serious defect?

13
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,103
Probably the same thing:

14
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,078
he wants to do everything calmly.

15
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,539
He doesn't seem to mind losing.

16
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,741
For me, his father,
it is a little disappointing.

17
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:17,088
<i>Keita,
what is your favourite season?</i>

18
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:18,919
Summer.

19
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:22,119
<i>And what did you do last summer?</i>

20
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,930
I went camping with my father

21
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,291
and we also flew kites.

22
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:31,963
<i>Is your father good
at ﬂying kites?</i>

23
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:34,101
Very good.

24
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:46,142

<i>Has it changed?</i>

31
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,145
They must be doing very well.

32
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:57,213
It's not the stadium I knew.

33
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,150
Lower your voice.

34
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:08,726
- I'm here!
- Did you study a lot?

35
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:13,333
Dear parents,
we are through for the day.

36
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,473
We wish a safe way home.

37
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,231
Thank you.

38
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:24,104
Keita.

39
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,620
I've never taken you camping,
have I?

40
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,421
Why did you say so, then?

41
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,192
The principal advised me to.

42
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:38,386
You've learned a lot
of things at school...

43
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:42,024
You also said:
"The omelette my mother made me."

44
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,270
- Did you pass it successfully?
- Yes.

45
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:50,934
- Have you painted balloons?
- Yes.

46
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:54,871
- <i>With a very nice monster</i>
- <i>A nice monster?!</i>

47
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,001
Damn,
you caught me red-handed!

48
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,170
Very strange seeing
you here on a Saturday.

49
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,670
I intended to leave before you came.

50
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,971
- The mock-up looks very good.
- Thank you.

51
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,506
I've checked it three times.

52
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:30,604
Your turn.

53
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,143
I won't be bothering you any more;
I'm off.

54
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,321
I won't be long,
shall we go eat somewhere?

55
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:39,785
I've planned going to the
movies with my wife.

56
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:42,193
Thanks to you and your hard work,

57
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,761
I have time to stay with
my family.

58
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,663
- I'm counting on you.
- I appreciate it

59
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,162
That's the South and that's the North,
isn't it?

60
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,562
Yes, the sun rises from here.

61
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,934
I'll put a couple of families
in the park.

62
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,335
- With dogs?
- Yes, it'll look more like everyday life.

63
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,544
<i>Everyone,</i>

64
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,077
the boss invites to have something to eat,
it's got very late.

65
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,318
You can choose between pizza,
rice with meat...

66
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:17,053
It doesn't seem bad to me
him going to a private college.

67
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:21,224
Ryota thinks he should make an effort
now for the sake of the future.

68
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:27,067
The fixed is ringing.

69
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,864
- Will you answer it?
- It must be daddy.

70
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:31,943
I'll tell you about aunt, bye.

71
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:33,606
<i>Well?</i>

72
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,180
<i>It's daddy.</i>

73
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,679
<i>Are you coming to dinner?</i>

74
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:14,411
I thought you'd get home later.

75
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:19,947
Shouldn't he be
practising the piano?

76
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,557
He's through with the exams,
so, for once...

77
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,693
He must be disciplined.

78
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,058
If you lose a day...

79
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:30,291
You'll be three days late
trying to recuperate, I know.

80
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,435
Come on, Keita.

81
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:35,732
It's piano time.

82
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,108
Come on, let's play.

83
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:45,874
<i>Have you already had dinner?</i>

84
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,244
<i>The bath is ready.</i>

85
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,143
Almost nothing,
a slice of pizza.

86
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,112
<i>Why didn't you send me
a text message?</i>

87
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:53,747
Isn't there anything?

88
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,319
<i>I'll make some pasta for you.</i>

89
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,923
Minura has send us
home-cooked pasta.

90
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,729
Seems great, let's have it.

91
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,330
Don't overcook the pasta.

92
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,371
Don't worry, I'll be careful.

93
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,668
No eggs in the evening,
too much coleslaw.

94
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,675
Just one won't do me anything,
isn't it so, Keita?

95
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:18,281
Punished!

96
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,012
Why am I being punished for?

97
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,642
<i>Come on, you try once again.</i>

98
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:03,290
I hope Minura
is all right with the new job.

99
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,355
<i>Of course he is.</i>

100
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,029
He is made for living
in the country.

101
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,163
<i>You don't seem to care.</i>

102
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:11,961
<i>You used to always protect him.</i>

103
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,796
I haven't got enough time
to waste it on losers.

104
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:21,401
Listen, listening to you,
I also am a loser.

105
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:23,980
Is he sleeping already?

106
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,152
He was stressed and tired.

107
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:32,646
We did our bets,
now it's up to him.

108
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,727
He's trying hard,
he wants to be like you.

109
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,766
Don't you think he has
has grown up?

110
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,234
You think so?

111
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,770
It'd seem he told Daichi
to leave him alone.

112
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,008
Let's hope it's true.

113
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,235
In our days,
kindness is a defect.

114
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,181
At the interview you said
it was his strength.

115
00:08:58,338 --> 00:08:59,874
You should praise him more.

116
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:02,144
It's enough that one of us
pampers him.

117
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,582
<i>May I?</i>

118
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,870
Thank you for taking the day off.

119
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,967
Keita was thrilled.

120
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,074
I'd love being able to dedicate at last
the Sundays to him.

121
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:33,710
I'll have more time when this
project will be over.

122
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,911
It's been six years I've been hearing
you saying the exact same thing.

123
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,254
Is that true?

124
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,986
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

125
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,790
I almost forgot.

126
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,629
They've called from
Maebashi hospital.

127
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:50,593
What hospital?!

128
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,467
That's where I gave birth to Keita.

129
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:55,735
Yes, and?

130
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,634
I don't know,
they said they wanted to talk to us.

131
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,974
About what?

132
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,610
They'll tell us when we go there.

133
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:06,650
I'm worried.

134
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,151
I hope it's nothing bad.

135
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,139
Swapped children?!

136
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:32,609
That used to happen long ago,
when we were born.

137
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:33,672
Yes.

138
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,280
Most cases
are from the end of the '60s.

139
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:40,245
From those experiences,

140
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,613
we started writing the names
with marker

141
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,053
on the sole of the new born babies.

142
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,691
What happened, then?

143
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:52,994
Well...

144
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:57,300
How do you know the child
is not the other couple's son?

145
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:02,006
The blood test
made when he enrolled school

146
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,173
doesn't match his parents'.

147
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:07,306
- But ours do.
- No.

148
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,476
Are you sure?

149
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,882
Then... Keita...

150
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,377
...is not our son?

151
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,683
Three male babies were born in that
hospital that same day.

152
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:27,058
We must first do their DNA tests.

153
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,159
Then we'll know...

154
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:36,066
Two to go, one to go.

155
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,173
"CONGRATULATIONS, KEITA"

156
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,372
Come on, together.

157
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:45,413
Congratulations, Keita,
for having passed the entrance exam.

158
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,941
- Very well.
- Come on.

159
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,614
- That's the way to do it!
- Great.

160
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,358
- The tomato is good.
- Really?

161
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,895
That's how you eat.

162
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,923
Open your mouth.

163
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:03,766
A fried crayfish.

164
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,731
A crayfish.

165
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,302
Let me see.

166
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,937
- That's very good.
- Very good.

167
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:14,968
<i>Now.</i>

168
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,171
Very good.

169
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:19,973
Do you want to see it?

170
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:21,611
Press here.

171
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,316
- If you press here,
you'll see the ones before. - Yes.

172
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,723
- Come on, once again.
- And if I press here...

173
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:43,933
All four together.

174
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:46,302
All four together.

175
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,574
All four together.

176
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:55,414
All four together.

177
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:33,955
Open your mouth.

178
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:54,241
<i>"The results of test #1,
taken from Nonomiya Ryota,"</i>

179
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:58,875
<i>"The results of test #2,
taken from Nonomiya Midori"</i>

180
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,642
<i>"The results of test #3,
taken from Nonomiya Keita"</i>

181
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,885
<i>"show they are not related. "</i>

182
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,690
"Report conclusions."

183
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,373
Now I understand.

184
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:54,601
That's exactly why I asked you

185
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,931
if that small town hospital
was sure.

186
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,833
My mother had me there...

187
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:01,937
- And my brothers.
- That's not enough.

188
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,646
You were very busy.

189
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,708
I was feeling very lonely.

190
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,113
My mother, at least,
could come and see me.

191
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,787
How come I didn't realize it?

192
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,592
I am the mother.

193
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:02,768
- <i>Yes, it's here.</i>
- <i>We were delayed.</i>

194
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:05,373
<i>I told you to fill the tank.</i>

195
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,903
Here they are.

196
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,871
Please forgive us,
we are very sorry for being late.

197
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,517
My wife had the idea...

198
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:17,120
...I should change clothes
just when we were leaving the house.

199
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:19,152
Good afternoon.

200
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,948
- The Saiki family.
- Good afternoon.

201
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:25,962
I can't...
It's been such a terrible surprise.

202
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,163
I am his wife,
my name is Yukari.

203
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:33,198
- And they are...
- Nonomiya, and my wife Midori.

204
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,231
This is Ryusei.

205
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:39,805
And this is Keita.

206
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,879
We took it last summer,
we went to Sunpia.

207
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:47,581
Don't we have a sharper photo?

208
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:55,421
This one?

209
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:58,354
- Where did we take it?
- In Karasugawa.

210
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,255
Yes, the Karasu River.

211
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:04,000
They still fish salmons and
trout in this river.

212
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,939
Look, look.

213
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:13,408
Ryusei and his brothers;
he's the one with the water gun.

214
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,082
What's his birth date?

215
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,587
The 28th of July.

216
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,754
The same day...

217
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,392
Maybe we've met here then...

218
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,223
I was rather sick after
I gave birth,

219
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:38,868
so I had to stay in bed.

220
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,639
He was born in a very sunny day,
very bright.

221
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,274
It made us think of
an Okinawan sunny day.

222
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,906
That's why we named him Ryusei,

223
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:53,049
like the kanji for "sunny day".

224
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,415
In cases like this,

225
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,787
100% of the parents

226
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:01,424
choose the to make the swap.

227
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,352
For the future of the children,

228
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,655
you should decide as soon
as possible.

229
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,500
- Before primary school begins.
- That's too soon.

230
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,931
We are talking about April,
that's less than six months.

231
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:20,275
- They are not pets.
- Even if they were.

232
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,273
You are right.

233
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,449
Even a pet, you don't swap it.

234
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,809
Besides,

235
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:32,850
haven't you thought about
any other possibility,

236
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:36,326
aside such a drastic one?

237
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,762
Yes, of course,
the hospital lawyer, Mr. Orima,

238
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,694
is looking into the case.

239
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:46,595
I can imagine that, for a parent,
it's a very difficult situation.

240
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,431
<i>Undoubtedly, right now,</i>

241
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,508
<i>and if we think
about the children's future...</i>

242
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,411
Did you find it all right
that we met without them?

243
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:09,352
Yes, we'd also like
to meet Keita.

244
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,052
All right, we'll keep in touch.

245
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,712
- <i>It's very late.</i>
- <i>I know, I'm sorry.</i>

246
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:31,904
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

247
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,648
Well, how did it go?
How are they, what do they do?

248
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,088
- He has a shop.
- A shopkeeper?

249
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:40,922
Come in.

250
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:42,691
- Mother.
- Yes.

251
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,828
I forgot to give you this.

252
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,556
A present from the
"Tiger" candy shop!

253
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,891
- I think it's green beans sweets.
- You've guessed.

254
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:54,036
It's not about the
green beans sweets, mother.

255
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:57,273
If you insult the green beans sweets,
you'll rouse the tiger.

256
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,507
- How is Keita?
- Sleeping.

257
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,043
We played a lot of
play-station tennis.

258
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,372
I'll be stiff tomorrow.

259
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,429
I didn't want to say anything
at the time,

260
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,798
but, when old Yamashita,
our neighbour,

261
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,236
saw Keita for the first time,
she said:

262
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,511
"He doesn't look like
neither of them."

263
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:10,941
That was...

264
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:17,321
It was two years ago.

265
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,012
I believe.

266
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,188
Ryota, your husband,

267
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:33,565
is really a privileged person,
compared with our family.

268
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:38,736
There were people who didn't
favoured you two getting married.

269
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,033
A lot of people thought that.

270
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,044
It's possible that so much
negative energy...

271
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:49,044
It's got nothing _to do with
people envying us.

272
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,878
My poor little girl.

273
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:05,167
This is Shinjuku station's
west exit area.

274
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:09,337
It's an honour presenting
the Shinjuku Spiral Tower to you.

275
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,079
It's a terrible tragedy.

276
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,651
I'll try not to let it
affect my work.

277
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:23,309
But, what will you do?

278
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:25,511
Swap them?

279
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,885
No; anyway,
we haven't got to that point yet.

280
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,427
Raising them both could be
a solution.

281
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:39,726
Both of them?

282
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:44,597
Yes, don't you like it?

283
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:01,256
What's the matter?

284
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,116
Don't you want to meet our son?

285
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,861
Of course I do.

286
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,566
But, if we go on like this,
we'll end up doing what the hospital says.

287
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:12,727
Everything will be fine.

288
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:14,460
Trust me.

289
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,474
Please, forgive us.

290
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:29,809
She started cleaning up
just when we were about to leave.

291
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,547
Hey, my name is Saiki Ryusei.

292
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,284
My name is Yamato.

293
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,086
My name is Miyu.

294
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,294
Come on, introduce yourself.

295
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:41,320
Hi, my name is Nonomiya Keita.

296
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,826
Hi, how are you?

297
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:46,265
Thank you for waiting,
here are your beverages.

298
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,233
And here is your food coupon.

299
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:51,439
Come on, Ryusei!

300
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,566
I also ordered a lot.

301
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,573
It's ¥6,030.

302
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:00,013
No, no.

303
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:02,285
- Allow me.
- No, it's out of the question.

304
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,347
I'd like an invoice.

305
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:09,749
- Write it on Maebashi hospital.
- Yes.

306
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:14,463
- And add this too.
- Yes, thank you.

307
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:26,639
You aren't eating, you're devouring,
you've dirtied your hands.

308
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,988
I've finished.

309
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,487
Shall we go play?

310
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:49,896
I also want to go and play.

311
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,325
Come on, go.

312
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:56,730
- Miyu!
- Take care of your brother.

313
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:58,499
Ryusei, watch over them.

314
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,656
Kids learn fast.

315
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:23,491
I wonder how much we could ask them
in damage

316
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:25,496
and impairment.

317
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,934
Money doesn't matter,

318
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:32,268
but it could help
find out how this happened.

319
00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:33,933
Of course.

320
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,446
I think the same way, but...

321
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:37,669
You'll see,

322
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:42,151
the only they can prove their good faith
is by financially compensating us.

323
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:44,285
Exactly, that's how things work.

324
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:46,920
Have you already seen a lawyer?

325
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:55,295
If that's the case,
allow me to take care of this.

326
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,934
A friend of mine has a lawyer's office.

327
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,238
Very well, ask him his opinion.

328
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,802
- <i>Daddy!</i>
- <i>Daddy!</i>

329
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:24,959
I'll call him.

330
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,933
My neck hurts.

331
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:42,273
<i>Oh mother!</i>

332
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,441
I didn't think he looked like us.

333
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,412
But he did.

334
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:56,757
A friend who's very frank accused
me of having had an affair.

335
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:59,453
I found that very cruel.

336
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,491
But I never imagined
something like this.

337
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:21,644
- Goodbye, goodbye
- Goodbye, Keita, see you soon.

338
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:34,192
What's this?

339
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:37,829
A note from Ryusei's mother:
"Count on me".

340
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,228
"Count on me"?!

341
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,130
That's rather arrogant.

342
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:47,603
You should prepare yourself.

343
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,712
We might have to sue them.

344
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,178
Sue them?

345
00:27:57,543 --> 00:28:01,047
Forgive me, I was in an
unexpected press conference.

346
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,859
- I know you are busy.
- I've thought about it.

347
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:09,055
I'm not interested in the money,
I want to know how it happened.

348
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,393
The hospital's lawyer
is a red-neck.

349
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:13,725
He knows about bankruptcies
and that's about all.

350
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:15,666
He doesn't understand anything.

351
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:17,698
I am grateful for your interest.

352
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,672
Do you mind?

353
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:25,607
I don't want the case
to get in court.

354
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:29,618
I'd like to get custody
of both kids.

355
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,853
That's a surprising idea.

356
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,624
You want to be the
other child's father?

357
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:41,960
I'd like him to live with us,
he's of my blood.

358
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:45,430
Your blood?
In our time and age this doesn't matter.

359
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:48,766
It's not about that,
but about being a father.

360
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:53,407
Notwithstanding everything,
you go on with your paternal obsession.

361
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:55,440
Come on, let it go.

362
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,046
Look here.

363
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:01,648
In England,

364
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:06,653
if the State considers the parents
incapable of taking care of their children,

365
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:09,722
they end up in the
custody of an institution.

366
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,128
Yes, if they are drug addicts,

367
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,923
or if the mother uses the house
to prostitute herself.

368
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:19,934
The mother raises her voice straight away
and the father doesn't react.

369
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:23,297
I doubt a court would consider this
to be parental neglect.

370
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:24,905
They do have rights.

371
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:29,469
We could give them a lot of money
if they'd let us adopt him legally.

372
00:29:29,735 --> 00:29:31,271
They won't accept.

373
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,180
You could suggest that at
the right moment.

374
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:38,680
You don't change.
You're as stubborn as ever.

375
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,615
As your lawyer,

376
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:46,284
I advise you to team up with them and
ask for compensation from the hospital.

377
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,493
January

378
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:02,976
What conclusion have you reached?
This our fourth meeting already.

379
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:04,879
Maybe

380
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:09,548
it's a good idea they start sleeping
in the other house.

381
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:14,349
Children adapt easily at this age.

382
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,224
We might consider this option,

383
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:21,663
but that has nothing to do
with the compensation.

384
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,059
Of course, of course.

385
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,996
What do you think,

386
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,566
Mr. Saiki?

387
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:32,401
Well...

388
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:34,575
The meetings are going fine,

389
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,542
but we should consider a solution,
don't you think so?

390
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:42,542
You say we should solve this,
but is there a textbook for this?

391
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:45,718
Well put.
I don't know if I like the suggestion

392
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,252
But it could turn out all right.

393
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:51,826
You have the same blood,
and that's what counts.

394
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:56,428
Once they feel that,
things will settle on their own.

395
00:30:56,722 --> 00:30:59,032
We must also take into consideration
Yamato and Miyu.

396
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:01,233
I don't want to rush into things.

397
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,266
Exactly. we don't see what
need there is to hurry things.

398
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:07,711
<i>What about you, Mr. Nonomiya'?</i>

399
00:31:09,735 --> 00:31:13,376
I suggest we try
this coming weekend.

400
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:15,912
On Saturday nights,
for instance.

401
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,549
Grown-ups are speaking,
go and play.

402
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:15,910
Keita,

403
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:18,338
do you like playing the piano?

404
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:22,911
You don't have to,
if you don't like it.

405
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:26,083
But, daddy says it's good for me.

406
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:32,186
You are right, and, then, there's the
concert. We'll go on, then?

407
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:34,726
We're going on!

408
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:53,143
I'm hopeless.

409
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:55,713
I've won!

410
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,287
Keita eats soba, yes.

411
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:06,161
I haven't yet given him
raw fish.

412
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,662
Listen, Keita.

413
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:12,992
We'll be leaving from here
at 10 am.

414
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,564
Because...

415
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:18,334
On target.

416
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,368
Because tomorrow you'll stay

417
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:23,471
at Ryusei's home.

418
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,347
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

419
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:29,082
You'll see,

420
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:34,916
it's some kind of a mission
to make you stronger.

421
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:40,893
- Do you know what a mission is?
- Yes.

422
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,555
- You do?
- Yes.

423
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,526
It's part of a strategy so you...

424
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:49,601
...grow up and
become stronger.

425
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:23,595
Oh mother...

426
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,369
It really is pathetic...

427
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,314
- Good afternoon.
- Hi.

428
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:38,787
Hi.

429
00:34:39,044 --> 00:34:41,183
Take good care of him, please.

430
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,589
Ryusei,
please climb in the back.

431
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:35,407
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

432
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,289
Chuji.

433
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:07,007
HEY,

434
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,067
did you know that Spiderman

435
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,211
is in fact a spider?

436
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:21,914
- Man, it really is cold.
- How are you doing?

437
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:23,557
<i>Fine, fine.</i>

438
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,885
<i>I have to change the
bathroom bulb.</i>

439
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,993
Shut the door, it's cold.

440
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,329
Do you want a LED one?

441
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:38,000
I'll have to piss more
quickly with so much light.

442
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,911
4O UV will do.

443
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:43,371
¥190.

444
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:48,048
Do you have any plans
for next Saturday?

445
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,118
- At 6am.
- Playing baseball again?

446
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:55,481
- Aren't you a little too old for this?
- We'll let you pitch.

447
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:58,957
That sort of thing is not for me,
my shoulder is old.

448
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:02,357
- It's old.
- But you had a kid!

449
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:05,964
- All right, we'll see
- I'm counting on you, thanks.

450
00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:11,073
Croquettes?

451
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:12,631
Yes, croquettes

452
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:13,874
<i>Three,</i>

453
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:15,575
<i>four,</i>

454
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:17,141
<i>five,</i>

455
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:19,071
six,

456
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:20,313
seven,

457
00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:21,944
eight,

458
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:23,408
nine,

459
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:24,615
ten!

460
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,616
Eleven.

461
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:29,082
- Twelve...
- This number smells nice.

462
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,415
Thirteen.

463
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:31,750
Fourteen.

464
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:33,418
Fifteen.

465
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,567
Here's the food.

466
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:41,560
Great, time to eat!

467
00:37:44,229 --> 00:37:45,435
I'm hungry.

468
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:48,070
It's good, very good.

469
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:54,984
Hurry up,
or there'll be nothing left for you.

470
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,645
It's hot, be careful.

471
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:11,826
- And for daddy.
- Only one egg for daddy.

472
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:17,195
He must eat more eggs
with the sukiyaki.

473
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,572
- Eat.
- Is that good?

474
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:28,108
It's too hot, I can't eat it.

475
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:34,652
I'll lower the flame.

476
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:41,328
It's good.

477
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:42,859
- You like it?
- It's good.

478
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,328
Ryusei.

479
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:48,830
Would you like me to
teach you how to use the chopsticks?

480
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:50,802
This way?

481
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:54,075
Look.

482
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,079
Wait, watch how I do it.

483
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:01,008
Move them like this.

484
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,518
Come on, you try.

485
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,253
Keita, son.

486
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,759
Please,
put this on the altar, will you?

487
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:27,568
There.

488
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:33,006
<i>Coming!</i>

489
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:35,277
Is it time already?

490
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,846
Can I toll the bell?

491
00:40:39,337 --> 00:40:40,816
- Of course.
- Good morning.

492
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,848
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

493
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:51,617
- Have you already done this?
- Yes, in my grandmother's house.

494
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,623
- Your grandmother's house?
- Yes.

495
00:40:54,352 --> 00:40:56,662
- All right, hi to everyone
- Hi.

496
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:58,832
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

497
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:01,299
Grandpa, this here is Keita.

498
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:03,472
Please, say hi to him.

499
00:41:08,366 --> 00:41:10,846
Don't get too close, it burns.

500
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:20,953
There's smoke.

501
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:25,326
I think it works.

502
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:28,994
The batteries for the car.

503
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:38,036
Great!

504
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,262
- Which one?
- That one.

505
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:05,360
- That one is the "Skytree".
- Yes.

506
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:22,243
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

507
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,546
What time is it?

508
00:42:28,446 --> 00:42:30,448
- A quarter to three.
- Thank you.

509
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,065
- Would you like to go home?
- What?

510
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:43,439
- Would you?
- Yes, let's go home.

511
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:55,978
I'm back!

512
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:00,956
Welcome home!

513
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,589
Have you behaved yourself?

514
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,788
We've made you come a long way.

515
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:11,296
Don't worry,
I was born in this town.

516
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:15,093
- And Ryota?
- He had a very important meeting.

517
00:43:15,827 --> 00:43:17,135
He works a lot.

518
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,965
Let's hope
my husband will do likewise.

519
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:23,475
"Leave for tomorrow
what you could do today",

520
00:43:24,135 --> 00:43:25,113
is my motto.

521
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:29,409
Sure, go on like this,
and you'll be dead before doing anything.

522
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:33,487
Don't try scaring me,
I've still got a couple of years left.

523
00:43:34,512 --> 00:43:36,514
Hey, what's this?

524
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,027
Nothing, a park incident.

525
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:44,257
I ran a lot and I fell.

526
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:48,202
He bled a little,
but then I stopped it.

527
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:52,373
You bled?

528
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:54,167
Did it hurt?

529
00:43:57,535 --> 00:44:00,744
<i>Did you know they
all bathed together?</i>

530
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:02,641
It's very small.

531
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:05,149
Like half of ours.

532
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:12,257
How is Ryusei's mother?

533
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:17,163
In the beginning I was very scared,
but she is very kind.

534
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:19,868
That's good.

535
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:27,876
Keita.

536
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,280
What would you say
if we ran away?

537
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:33,742
Where to?

538
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:38,250
- Somewhere far away.
- Where is far away?

539
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:43,316
In a place where
nobody knows us.

540
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,897
And what will daddy do?

541
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,262
Well, daddy...

542
00:44:57,762 --> 00:44:59,764
Daddy is very taken with
his work.

543
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:22,090
Wait, Ryusei!

544
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,796
Yamato!

545
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:26,958
Wait, Yamato!

546
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:30,064
<i>That's for sure.</i>

547
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,899
Your hair is wet.

548
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:38,939
Wait, come here.

549
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:43,243
- Stay put, I'll dry you.
- I already am dry.

550
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,248
No, you are not.

551
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:50,817
- <i>But I am!</i>
- <i>It's soaking in the back.</i>

552
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,323
- <i>Turn around.</i>
- <i>Don't try my face.</i>

553
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:54,494
<i>Come here.</i>

554
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:58,258
Come on,
tonight we'll all sleep together.

555
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,170
They admit damages were inflicted,

556
00:46:07,398 --> 00:46:09,969
but they don't even
bother to excuse themselves

557
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:13,478
That's why you should
have come with me.

558
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:17,412
It's useless picking on me.

559
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,187
We'll put you a dressing.

560
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,655
In Ryusei's home,

561
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:29,362
they call it a
sticking-plaster.

562
00:46:29,854 --> 00:46:30,958
They do?

563
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:34,999
<i>All right, done.</i>

564
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:37,433
<i>Come, go and say
daddy good night.</i>

565
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:41,705
- Good night daddy.
- Sleep tight.

566
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,284
How did lunch go, all right?

567
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:58,891
A success, Kaoru ran into
an university boyfriend.

568
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:01,030
The manager
was very disappointed.

569
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,190
Did they say anything about me,
made any comments?

570
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:11,040
Did they wonder why, as a mother,
I didn't realize it?

571
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:14,738
No, not at all.

572
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:20,345
<i>In fact,
you are wondering about that.</i>

573
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,049
- <i>No,</i> I <i>am not</i>
- <i>You're lying.</i>

574
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:27,853
You think
everything is my fault.

575
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:39,598
<i>When will I go again to Ryusei's
home to spend the night?</i>

576
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,068
Next Saturday.

577
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,703
May I take this with me?

578
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:46,739
<i>Sure you can.</i>

579
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:48,708
<i>That's great.</i>

580
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:51,070
<i>He can fix no matter what.</i>

581
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:53,407
<i>That's wonderful.</i>

582
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:55,880
Well,

583
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:59,210
we'll ask him
to fix the radiator.

584
00:48:03,514 --> 00:48:05,391
Mother, won't you stay?

585
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,085
April

586
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:09,595
<i>I have knitting classes,
I have to go.</i>

587
00:48:09,787 --> 00:48:12,859
<i>Besides,
it feels like staying in a hotel,</i>

588
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:14,536
<i>I'd rather go home.</i>

589
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:18,730
During the war,

590
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:22,441
a lot of kids were separated from their
parents, or lost them,

591
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:24,044
and other people adopted them.

592
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:27,282
What really matters
is who brings you up.

593
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:29,075
I haven't yet decided
to bring him up.

594
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:31,749
But, then, why all this?

595
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:33,886
Why make him come and go?

596
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:35,148
We'll talk about it

597
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:38,218
and we'll see what
decision we'll take.

598
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,520
Forgive me.

599
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,425
An old woman like myself
shouldn't butt in.

600
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,397
On the contrary,
your opinion counts a lot.

601
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,728
I thank you for that.

602
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,632
We are ready now.

603
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,133
Dressed like this,

604
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:54,172
you are more handsome
than any prince.

605
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:02,278
Good morning.

606
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,254
- They have already arrived.
- Yes.

607
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:09,786
Mr. Saiki.

608
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,659
Good morning.

609
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:16,828
The hospital has paid for me
taking the shinkansen.

610
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:18,399
Come in, please.

611
00:49:19,857 --> 00:49:21,962
- This is for you.
- Thank you very much.

612
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:26,899
<i>Come on, come here.</i>

613
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:29,873
Ryusei has already told me
it looks like a hotel.

614
00:49:33,604 --> 00:49:34,844
Keita, hi!

615
00:49:37,041 --> 00:49:39,385
You are so handsome!

616
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:43,624
You must be the prince
of a far away land.

617
00:49:43,848 --> 00:49:46,158
It's a pleasure meeting you,
I'm the grandmother.

618
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:49,624
Of course, you are Keita's grandmother,
I'm pleased meeting you.

619
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:55,164
But you are so young...

620
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:57,704
<i>Flattery won't take you anywhere.</i>

621
00:49:57,895 --> 00:50:00,375
<i>I don't think I'll ever see you again,
so there's no need for it.</i>

622
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:12,485
- May I?
- Of course.

623
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:17,016
Keita, what did you pick up?

624
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:21,922
- Let's see.
- A nice petal.

625
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:30,566
- Stop filming him.
- You don't have to.

626
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:32,934
Look, I'm filming myself, see?

627
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,672
<i>Tsuyuki Mao.</i>

628
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,542
- <i>Tsuyuki Mao, answer</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

629
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:49,553
<i>Nonomiya Keita.</i>

630
00:50:49,947 --> 00:50:50,755
Yes!

631
00:50:58,556 --> 00:50:59,933
<i>I can't understand ii.</i>

632
00:51:02,293 --> 00:51:05,467
When I saw Keita's little face,
I thought of Ryusei.

633
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:11,380
But, now, I'm looking at him,
and his is Keita's face,

634
00:51:11,936 --> 00:51:12,710
isn't it so?

635
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:26,955
<i>Mr. Nonomiya-san!</i>

636
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:28,724
<i>Ryota-san!</i>

637
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:31,297
<i>Ryota-san!</i>

638
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,295
Your turn!

639
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:34,732
Your turn!

640
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:37,133
Such pain, such pain!

641
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,087
I can't do it any more,
it's over.

642
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,180
They've worn me out.

643
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:59,925
One must have them
before being 40.

644
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:01,992
I am too old.

645
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:06,494
You are younger than I.

646
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:10,469
You should find time
to be around your son.

647
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:16,206
Well, there's all kinds of families
in this world.

648
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:19,546
Don't you bathe together?

649
00:52:20,037 --> 00:52:23,211
In our family, the idea is
one must be independent.

650
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,686
Well, if that's the case,
of course it's very honourable.

651
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:29,949
But, believe me,
it's worth dedicating some time to him.

652
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:33,785
Let's be honest,
in these last six months

653
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:37,358
I've spent more time with him
than you have.

654
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:40,632
Come on,
there are other things besides time!

655
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:44,636
Don't you think that,
for kids, giving them time is everything.

656
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:49,474
There are things at work
that only I can do.

657
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:56,682
But no one can play the role
of the father other than you.

658
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:09,058
Hey!

659
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,024
RYusei!

660
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:13,695
We're leaving.

661
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:16,530
You'd say they are brothers,
it's unbelievable.

662
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:21,442
One pork curry to go, please.

663
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:23,468
One second, please.

664
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,911
My father-in-law is with us,
I think he must be hungry.

665
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,387
Little by little he is
sliding back into childhood.

666
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,454
It's like we had four kids.

667
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:36,214
Or rather five, I'd say.

668
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:38,256
I can't take care of all of them.

669
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:40,585
Do you mean me?

670
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:44,724
If that is the case, who knows,
maybe we could take of those two.

671
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,259
Those two?

672
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:50,603
Keita and Ryusei.

673
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:53,437
Wait,

674
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:55,434
did you mean that?

675
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:57,173
Yes.

676
00:53:58,469 --> 00:53:59,880
Don't you find it possible?

677
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,149
I can't believe it.

678
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:09,288
You are insulting us.

679
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:13,894
- If we think about his future...
- Our kids don't have a future?!

680
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:16,458
I have larger financial means.

681
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:20,125
There's a lot of stuff
you can't buy with money.

682
00:54:21,158 --> 00:54:24,332
You want to buy a child now,
is that what all it's about?

683
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:27,269
Didn't you say you were
interested in the money?

684
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:30,638
Forgive him, he's tired,
he doesn't realize what he's saying.

685
00:54:32,169 --> 00:54:33,910
The children are looking at us.

686
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,585
<i>The pork curry is ready.</i>

687
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:43,549
You've never lost a game,
have you?

688
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:47,495
He doesn't have a clue
what other people feel.

689
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:57,338
<i>How will you settle this'?</i>

690
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:02,276
<i>You hit at him
like it was nothing.</i>

691
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:05,508
I can't still believe,
he surely must have got mad.

692
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:08,444
Shut up for a second, please,
and let me think.

693
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:11,912
Right when we had started
to get along very well...

694
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:16,947
Why should I put up with
a shopkeeper giving me advices?

695
00:55:17,214 --> 00:55:18,659
Don't start again.

696
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:21,156
You're back!

697
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:24,555
- <i>Cafie' latte, for mother</i>
- <i>Thank you.</i>

698
00:55:27,224 --> 00:55:28,726
And a black one for daddy.

699
00:55:29,293 --> 00:55:30,397
Thank you.

700
00:55:35,399 --> 00:55:37,845
- Here's the change, mother.
- Thank you very much.

701
00:55:44,608 --> 00:55:45,985
Here it goes!

702
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:48,750
Your turn!

703
00:55:49,313 --> 00:55:50,417
That's the way to do it!

704
00:55:51,415 --> 00:55:55,329
It went out, Keita,
it has to hit inside.

705
00:55:56,153 --> 00:55:59,259
It's not good,
careful not to hit outside.

706
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:02,864
Do you remember nurse Miyazaki?

707
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:03,935
No.

708
00:56:05,262 --> 00:56:08,209
- Who knows when I met her...
- What will she say?

709
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,439
I suppose the hospital
will try to prove

710
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:14,945
that the working conditions of
the staff were good ones.

711
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:18,718
She started ironing
when we were leaving...

712
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:21,115
Please,
this is not the moment for nonsense.

713
00:56:21,345 --> 00:56:24,019
Please forgive us
for the other day.

714
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:27,919
Yes, of course.

715
00:56:28,452 --> 00:56:30,454
No, no, it also was our fault.

716
00:56:31,288 --> 00:56:33,290
I swear to tell the truth,
and nothing but the truth,

717
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:35,935
in full accord with my conscience,

718
00:56:36,293 --> 00:56:40,264
without withholding anything
and with no intent of hiding the truth.

719
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:43,577
- Saiki Yukari.
- Nonomiya Midori.

720
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:45,378
Miyazaki Shoko.

721
00:56:46,303 --> 00:56:50,376
Admitting the hospital
made a mistake,

722
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:53,485
shouldn't you have realized it?

723
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:55,185
You are the baby's mother.

724
00:56:57,948 --> 00:57:00,519
In ordinary circumstances,
probably I would have.

725
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:03,594
But I suffered a post-partum haemorrhage.

726
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:07,098
I barely was conscious
during a couple of days.

727
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:12,972
Do you think you'll be able
to swap children without difficulties?

728
00:57:13,497 --> 00:57:14,703
I don't know.

729
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:18,143
Even if we'll decide to swap them,

730
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:20,747
there's nothing that guarantees
the children will adapt.

731
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,949
The pain this mistake
caused our family

732
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,485
won't go away easily.

733
00:57:27,978 --> 00:57:31,858
It's a pain we'll have to put up with
for many years.

734
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:36,796
Tell me the schedule
you had at the time.

735
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:40,697
Were you supposed to be on night-shifts
for a number of days in a row?

736
00:57:41,992 --> 00:57:42,993
No.

737
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:47,033
Compared with other hospitals,
the shifts were very good.

738
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:52,006
<i>If that's how things were, why do you
think this accident happened?</i>

739
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,009
It was no accident.

740
00:58:00,444 --> 00:58:02,287
It wasn't an accident?

741
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,391
What do you mean by that?

742
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:10,990
The Nonomiyas seemed
very happy with their son.

743
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:13,390
I did it on purpose.

744
00:58:25,469 --> 00:58:28,643
I had a lot of problems
raising my husband's children.

745
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:32,747
I vented my frustration
on other people's children.

746
00:58:35,479 --> 00:58:38,460
The Nonomiyas had the most
expensive home of the lot.

747
00:58:39,216 --> 00:58:41,822
She told me her husband was
working for a big company.

748
00:58:42,486 --> 00:58:44,932
Her family was coming
to see her all the time.

749
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,060
In comparison with her,

750
00:58:51,094 --> 00:58:52,129
I had nothing.

751
00:58:54,498 --> 00:58:57,843
<i>Can you describe how you
were feeling back then'?</i>

752
00:59:00,137 --> 00:59:02,276
Sincerely,
I was happy to find out

753
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:05,276
I wasn't the only one who
had problems.

754
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:09,886
All right,

755
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:11,287
let's see.

756
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:15,596
What pushed you to confess
right now?

757
00:59:18,355 --> 00:59:21,097
My husband's children
love me now.

758
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:26,801
That's why what I did back then
seemed really monstrous.

759
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:30,875
I want to be punished
for what I did.

760
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:36,546
I ask you for forgiveness
from the bottom of my heart.

761
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:39,114
I am very sorry.

762
00:59:42,879 --> 00:59:47,123
She can't have thought she'd alleviate
her frustrations on our expense.

763
00:59:48,452 --> 00:59:51,661
She was aware her husband had children
when she married him.

764
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:53,634
She looked relieved.

765
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:56,095
For her is like shop lifting.

766
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:59,134
She didn't look like she understood
the consequences of her actions.

767
01:00:00,297 --> 01:00:02,777
Now she says she's feeling happy.

768
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:05,312
How can anyone be so selfish?

769
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:06,770
I'd say

770
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:10,281
the hospital should pay more
in damages and losses.

771
01:00:10,474 --> 01:00:12,476
- That's obvious.
- Yes, of course, much more.

772
01:00:14,244 --> 01:00:15,154
Please,

773
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,922
don't forget to ask
Mr. Suzumoto.

774
01:00:20,217 --> 01:00:21,025
Yes.

775
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:25,129
- She'll go to prison, won't she?
- Yes.

776
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:26,799
Of course she'll go to prison.

777
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:30,298
Well, five or six years
don't seem enough to me.

778
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:34,604
Unfortunately,
the crime has been expired.

779
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:37,168
Expired?!

780
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:40,247
Yes,
that's what Suzumoto told me.

781
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:43,513
We could accuse her
of kidnapping,

782
01:00:43,707 --> 01:00:46,313
but it expires after five years.

783
01:00:49,179 --> 01:00:51,352
- That's ridiculous!
- Lower you voice, please.

784
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:55,358
We can't allow it to be
that easy for her.

785
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:58,057
We'll always suffer,

786
01:00:58,355 --> 01:01:00,198
and nothing will happen
to this woman.

787
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:05,870
She knew her crime had expired,
that's why she confessed it.

788
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:07,469
I am sure.

789
01:01:09,299 --> 01:01:10,778
I'll never forgive her.

790
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:12,646
Never.

791
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,246
Ever.

792
01:01:17,107 --> 01:01:19,053
June

793
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,219
Let's see how you are doing.

794
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:25,418
Look what
a flower stem Megumi is making.

795
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:27,495
She's making it very well.

796
01:01:41,998 --> 01:01:44,740
She was taking
blood pressure pills.

797
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:47,007
Is it the second one?

798
01:01:47,337 --> 01:01:48,247
The third.

799
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:51,283
At least it
wasn't Mr. Nobuko.

800
01:01:53,577 --> 01:01:54,555
Well, yes.

801
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:57,957
Try calling her "mother"
when you see her, all right?

802
01:01:58,848 --> 01:01:59,588
Yes?

803
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:01,321
Don't I usually do that?

804
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,258
Just imagine:
father is so weak that he asked

805
01:02:07,424 --> 01:02:09,131
his sons come and see him.

806
01:02:10,527 --> 01:02:13,804
Better this way, it'll do him good
being a little weak.

807
01:02:14,998 --> 01:02:17,376
When he sees the roses,
he'll start crying.

808
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:24,709
- The change.
- Thank you

809
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:28,151
- Thank you for ordering from us.
- Thank you for coming.

810
01:02:34,451 --> 01:02:36,988
It's the only restaurant
in the entire neighbourhood.

811
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:42,466
Have you recovered entirely
from your illness?

812
01:02:43,727 --> 01:02:46,469
If I hadn't,
you wouldn't be here visiting.

813
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:50,143
I've already told you last time
I couldn't give you any more money.

814
01:02:50,567 --> 01:02:52,137
I don't need any money.

815
01:02:52,569 --> 01:02:55,743
I work as a concierge
in a Minowa neighbourhood building.

816
01:02:56,906 --> 01:02:57,680
And she

817
01:02:58,642 --> 01:03:00,087
works part time.

818
01:03:00,577 --> 01:03:03,353
- Stop playing the stock market.
- That's enough, Ryota.

819
01:03:04,414 --> 01:03:07,725
You like salmon roe,
eat your fill.

820
01:03:09,586 --> 01:03:11,588
I'd love being able to.

821
01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:14,459
But I have to be careful
with the uric acid.

822
01:03:16,493 --> 01:03:17,995
I'll make an exception.

823
01:03:28,505 --> 01:03:30,542
Why do roe taste so good?!...

824
01:03:33,977 --> 01:03:35,786
What about horse races?

825
01:03:38,615 --> 01:03:40,788
By the way you look
you must have lost a lot.

826
01:03:43,386 --> 01:03:46,128
You're again betting
on the wrong horse, mother.

827
01:03:46,456 --> 01:03:48,060
Why do you insist on suffering?

828
01:03:48,458 --> 01:03:50,301
You've got the wrong horse.

829
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:53,239
Betting is no good, you'll see.

830
01:03:53,797 --> 01:03:56,073
It seems I'm like you in this.

831
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:01,907
Well,
that's how marriage life is.

832
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:06,644
Don't go out of your way
for him.

833
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:08,918
You work more than a nurse.

834
01:04:09,479 --> 01:04:12,585
If I am your nurse,
you must pay me ¥1,000 an hour.

835
01:04:13,817 --> 01:04:16,229
That's more than I get paid.

836
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:24,396
Three years of practising,

837
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:28,074
but always plays the same
"Tender Flower".

838
01:04:29,499 --> 01:04:31,172
There's no one who takes a nap.

839
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:32,904
Shout, they'll hear me.

840
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:35,438
Exactly, I want them to hear me.

841
01:04:44,748 --> 01:04:46,625
Well,
have you got to know him yet?

842
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:51,989
I mean your son, the real one.

843
01:04:52,689 --> 01:04:55,226
- Yes, we know him
- Does he look like you?

844
01:04:57,694 --> 01:04:58,968
<i>Of course he does.</i>

845
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,968
<i>That's what family means.</i>

846
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:06,203
<i>Ones children are like one,
even if not living together.</i>

847
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:09,109
Come on, father,
let's not start with this.

848
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:11,116
Don't you think so?

849
01:05:12,776 --> 01:05:15,586
Listen to me,
it's a matter of blood.

850
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:19,886
It's the same in humans
as it is in horses.

851
01:05:21,518 --> 01:05:24,158
This child will be
more and more like you.

852
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:27,565
But Keita

853
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:31,899
will every time look more like
his natural father, believe me.

854
01:05:33,797 --> 01:05:36,073
<i>Swap the children
as soon as possible</i>

855
01:05:36,733 --> 01:05:39,646
<i>and never see this family again.</i>

856
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,347
It's not that easy.

857
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:55,427
It's slippery, be careful.

858
01:05:55,819 --> 01:05:58,823
I know it's slippery,
don't be such a bore.

859
01:06:00,156 --> 01:06:01,464
Are you my wife?

860
01:06:01,758 --> 01:06:03,738
I only wanted to be kind to you.

861
01:06:04,494 --> 01:06:06,599
<i>Go on like this and you'll
find yourself without any friends.</i>

862
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:09,205
<i>It's been a while since
I haven't had any friends.</i>

863
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:16,276
Even if your father said it,

864
01:06:16,773 --> 01:06:20,448
it's enough living with someone,
blood counts for less.

865
01:06:20,577 --> 01:06:23,353
Love the other person
and you'll end up being like her.

866
01:06:23,546 --> 01:06:25,355
It happens in married couples.

867
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:29,161
And, probably,
the same thing happens with children.

868
01:06:30,687 --> 01:06:31,722
In my case,

869
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,267
that's how I felt inside

870
01:06:34,858 --> 01:06:37,532
during the years I raised you.

871
01:06:42,632 --> 01:06:44,236
- Come back soon.
- Yes.

872
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,313
Tell Manami I'll soon come and see
her precious bedspreads.

873
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:48,710
Yes, please, do come.

874
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:50,309
Goodbye.

875
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:54,652
And the next time,

876
01:06:55,144 --> 01:06:57,522
bring something to drink,
forget the flowers.

877
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:05,557
- I'm happy your father is well.
- He acted it.

878
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:07,598
I had to ask for a day off.

879
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:10,869
Did he say anything about Keita?

880
01:07:11,895 --> 01:07:13,431
No, not much.

881
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:17,342
Keita, father's back.

882
01:07:17,734 --> 01:07:20,408
- Welcome back.
- Thank you very much.

883
01:07:25,742 --> 01:07:28,086
For Father's Day,
he made it at school.

884
01:07:35,852 --> 01:07:36,796
Keita,

885
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,032
thank you very much.

886
01:07:40,256 --> 01:07:42,930
The second one is for
Ryusei's father.

887
01:07:44,027 --> 01:07:46,598
I want to thank him
for having fixed the robot.

888
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:51,306
I understand.

889
01:07:53,336 --> 01:07:55,247
You are very kind and generous.

890
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:27,911
<i>Why don't we go on
like until now?</i>

891
01:08:29,405 --> 01:08:31,407
<i>Like nothing happened.</i>

892
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:35,779
Every day that goes by,

893
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:39,790
Keita will look more and more
like you.

894
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:43,097
And Ryusei

895
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:46,833
will look more and more like us.

896
01:08:49,993 --> 01:08:51,165
Can you

897
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:54,836
love him like before,

898
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:58,841
knowing it's not of your blood?

899
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:00,871
That has got nothing to do.

900
01:09:03,006 --> 01:09:04,986
You are only worried

901
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:08,488
of your son looking like you

902
01:09:09,846 --> 01:09:12,850
because you don't feel
a true bond with him.

903
01:09:17,353 --> 01:09:19,458
The longer we'll take,

904
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:22,063
the more difficult it will be.

905
01:09:24,227 --> 01:09:25,137
For us.

906
01:09:27,864 --> 01:09:28,865
<i>For the children.</i>

907
01:09:36,572 --> 01:09:38,677
Keita, you take care of them.

908
01:09:40,043 --> 01:09:41,420
I have to go.

909
01:09:42,812 --> 01:09:44,849
- Go, goodbye.
- Goodbye!

910
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,855
The bento is ready.

911
01:10:01,164 --> 01:10:02,734
<i>¥400 please.</i>

912
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,108
Keita, there's another
piece of fried chicken for you.

913
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:11,244
- Be careful on your way home.
- Goodbye.

914
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,621
When the summer will come,

915
01:10:47,877 --> 01:10:50,585
we'll have sparklers
in the garden.

916
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,284
We'll swim in the pool

917
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:56,760
and we'll eat freshly cut
watermelon.

918
01:10:58,387 --> 01:10:59,991
- You too, Keita.
- Yes.

919
01:11:10,066 --> 01:11:11,636
So beautiful.

920
01:11:12,969 --> 01:11:14,039
I am at home.

921
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:17,211
I've got here already.

922
01:11:17,907 --> 01:11:21,013
<i>Yes, you've been a great help,
thanks.</i>

923
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:22,813
<i>I'll talk to you.</i>

924
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:28,194
Welcome home.

925
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:32,264
Where is Ryusei?

926
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:33,998
Having a bath.

927
01:11:39,262 --> 01:11:41,037
I didn't realize what time it was.

928
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:46,546
I'm sorry
you have to take care of him.

929
01:11:49,105 --> 01:11:50,812
But tomorrow I have a day off.

930
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:53,853
It has always been this way,
it doesn't matter.

931
01:11:54,577 --> 01:11:55,715
It doesn't matter.

932
01:12:01,184 --> 01:12:02,629
Who were you talking with?

933
01:12:03,886 --> 01:12:04,990
With Yu-chan.

934
01:12:05,721 --> 01:12:08,895
She says Yudai wants to open
a sun' articles shop

935
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:10,502
when he turns fifty.

936
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:13,299
The best part is that
he knows nothing about sun'.

937
01:12:18,134 --> 01:12:20,307
You shouldn't
keep in touch with her.

938
01:12:20,937 --> 01:12:23,850
As mothers,
we have a lot of things to share.

939
01:12:24,574 --> 01:12:26,247
But you don't understand this.

940
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:19,566
He plays very well.

941
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:20,963
Of course.

942
01:13:25,101 --> 01:13:26,603
Keita, I don't understand you.

943
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:31,283
If you lack the will
to play well,

944
01:13:31,474 --> 01:13:32,953
it would be_better
you gave it up.

945
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,947
Not everyone
can work as much as you do.

946
01:13:39,382 --> 01:13:41,487
Has working become a defect no?

947
01:13:42,385 --> 01:13:45,389
Not all of us can work as much
no matter how much we'd like it.

948
01:13:47,823 --> 01:13:50,463
I think Keita takes after me.

949
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:12,685
Is he asleep?

950
01:14:20,556 --> 01:14:22,433
I did what you asked me.

951
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:26,272
You obviously want
Keita to leave.

952
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:30,337
You said you'd solve it.

953
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:32,702
Liar.

954
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:38,009
I didn't think it'd end like this.

955
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:40,312
You had decided this
from the very start.

956
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:43,955
Six years with Keita
count for nothing with you.

957
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:47,850
- Blood is more important.
- You are wrong, that's not how it is.

958
01:14:48,217 --> 01:14:49,525
Are you telling me that?

959
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:56,932
What did you say when you found out
Keita wasn't ours?

960
01:14:57,727 --> 01:14:59,035
Don't you remember it any more?

961
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:00,966
Yes, I remember it.

962
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:09,710
I don't understand how
you can not see it.

963
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:15,986
Forgive me.

964
01:15:16,812 --> 01:15:18,223
- It's not your fault.
- No!

965
01:15:18,814 --> 01:15:20,225
It's not about that.

966
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:25,027
<i>I'll remind you what you said.</i>

967
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:27,893
<i>"Now I understand".</i>

968
01:15:29,825 --> 01:15:31,498
It made sense then.

969
01:15:35,998 --> 01:15:37,671
What makes sense now?

970
01:15:40,436 --> 01:15:41,574
Never

971
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:46,748
were you able to accept that Keita
doesn't have your ability.

972
01:15:50,012 --> 01:15:51,389
I'll never forget

973
01:15:53,749 --> 01:15:55,422
what you said back then.

974
01:16:07,196 --> 01:16:08,402
Ready?

975
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:15,611
You're very good.

976
01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:25,454
Great.

977
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:28,285
<i>Ready? Let's go.</i>

978
01:16:32,955 --> 01:16:34,229
Can I have it?

979
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:40,429
Through there.

980
01:16:49,238 --> 01:16:50,012
The camera,

981
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:52,183
do you want me to give it to you?

982
01:16:56,011 --> 01:16:56,819
<i>Why?</i>

983
01:16:57,346 --> 01:16:58,120
<i>Don't you want it'?</i>

984
01:16:58,747 --> 01:17:00,090
That's it, I don't want it.

985
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:04,029
I understand.

986
01:17:10,526 --> 01:17:12,028
Listen, Keita,

987
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:14,699
when you go to your home,

988
01:17:14,997 --> 01:17:18,501
it'd be better if you'd call father
and mother with "uncle" and "aunt".

989
01:17:20,202 --> 01:17:22,239
Even if there will be times
when you'll feel alone,

990
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:24,516
you shouldn't call us.

991
01:17:25,207 --> 01:17:26,185
Promise that.

992
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:28,483
Is it a mission?

993
01:17:29,545 --> 01:17:31,388
Yes, it's a mission.

994
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:35,661
Do I have an objective?

995
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:38,723
It's not clear yet.

996
01:17:42,024 --> 01:17:43,196
Keita,

997
01:17:44,226 --> 01:17:47,173
you won't understand now
the meaning of this mission.

998
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:52,137
But I am sure that,
in ten years' time, you will.

999
01:17:53,569 --> 01:17:55,515
In Ryusei's home,

1000
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:58,075
will I also play the piano?

1001
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:01,480
As you'll wish.

1002
01:18:02,811 --> 01:18:06,554
If you'll want to go on playing,
tell them, and we'll arrange it.

1003
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:48,856
Listen, there'll be no kites
around here today.

1004
01:19:49,985 --> 01:19:51,965
It's the time for the
ayu fish to spawn.

1005
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:56,467
They've laid cables
to protect them from the birds.

1006
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:00,462
Let's go!

1007
01:20:01,163 --> 01:20:02,141
Enough now!

1008
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:03,566
RYusei!

1009
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:16,519
When we were kids...

1010
01:20:16,945 --> 01:20:17,821
Well,

1011
01:20:18,714 --> 01:20:20,694
the truth is I'm a little
older than you.

1012
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:23,296
But my father

1013
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:27,122
used to make kites from bamboo sticks
and very fine white paper.

1014
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:32,033
He'd cut paper strips from the
newspaper for the kite's tails.

1015
01:20:36,131 --> 01:20:38,702
Nowadays,
kites fly like on their own.

1016
01:20:39,034 --> 01:20:41,878
Back then it was much more
difficult making them fly.

1017
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:46,914
My father

1018
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:51,055
was not the kind that'd
fly kites with their kids.

1019
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:56,028
I understand.

1020
01:20:56,752 --> 01:21:00,222
But there's nothing forcing you
to act like your father.

1021
01:21:04,593 --> 01:21:07,369
Please,
do fly kites with Ryusei.

1022
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:12,544
I will.

1023
01:21:21,977 --> 01:21:23,650
A train went by.

1024
01:21:24,279 --> 01:21:25,451
It went by!

1025
01:21:28,317 --> 01:21:30,888
He doesn't show it,
but lots of things scare him.

1026
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:35,763
He was very late in going
to the bathroom alone at night.

1027
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:38,735
I always had to go with him.

1028
01:21:41,463 --> 01:21:44,535
But when Yamato was born,
he turned into an older brother.

1029
01:21:47,336 --> 01:21:51,307
He promised that when Yamato
wouldn't be using diapers any more,

1030
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:53,985
he'd take him to the
bathroom at night.

1031
01:22:00,282 --> 01:22:01,386
Keita

1032
01:22:03,419 --> 01:22:05,660
has been telling me sine he
was little that he wants a brother.

1033
01:22:08,657 --> 01:22:09,635
But

1034
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:13,401
I can no longer have any children.

1035
01:22:17,366 --> 01:22:18,344
That's why

1036
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:22,112
I think he'll be happy

1037
01:22:24,206 --> 01:22:26,117
with a brother

1038
01:22:28,177 --> 01:22:29,247
and a sister,

1039
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:33,422
even if it happens this way.

1040
01:23:08,283 --> 01:23:09,353
Keita,

1041
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:13,165
when you go home,

1042
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:16,492
you mustn't worry about anything.

1043
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:20,803
Ryusei's mother and father

1044
01:23:22,097 --> 01:23:24,008
also love you very much.

1045
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:29,147
More than you do, daddy?

1046
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:36,587
More than I do.

1047
01:23:42,384 --> 01:23:43,328
<i>Hey,</i>

1048
01:23:44,152 --> 01:23:45,995
<i>how about taking a photo
with all of us'?</i>

1049
01:23:46,488 --> 01:23:47,899
- Yes.
- Let's go.

1050
01:24:08,777 --> 01:24:10,085
<i>Ready?</i>

1051
01:24:10,612 --> 01:24:12,216
<i>Come on, don't move.</i>

1052
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:16,926
Smile.

1053
01:24:18,453 --> 01:24:19,761
Let's all smile.

1054
01:24:22,591 --> 01:24:24,070
Come on, get ready!

1055
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:25,863
One,

1056
01:24:26,428 --> 01:24:27,304
two,

1057
01:24:27,496 --> 01:24:28,406
and three!

1058
01:24:39,274 --> 01:24:41,447
- Why are you laughing?
- Why am I laughing?

1059
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:43,612
- I don't see the joke.
- Neither can I.

1060
01:24:51,186 --> 01:24:53,132
<i>"I shouldn't bite the straws.</i>

1061
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:56,926
<i>I go to English classes every day
and I study a lot.</i>

1062
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:00,065
<i>I must behave when I go the toilet.</i>

1063
01:25:00,262 --> 01:25:03,505
<i>I bathe alone,
without making any noise.</i>

1064
01:25:06,234 --> 01:25:08,680
Or play the play-station
for half an hour a day.

1065
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:11,983
I must call you mother and father."

1066
01:25:12,174 --> 01:25:13,244
Why?

1067
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:18,256
You are not my father.

1068
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:20,422
You are not my father.

1069
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:24,829
From now on,
I'll be your father.

1070
01:25:25,187 --> 01:25:25,995
Why?

1071
01:25:31,593 --> 01:25:32,663
It doesn't matter.

1072
01:25:33,629 --> 01:25:34,539
Why?

1073
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:38,971
Well,

1074
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:41,175
they...

1075
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:48,181
I'll explain it to you.

1076
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:51,381
Your father and mother

1077
01:25:52,547 --> 01:25:53,617
live there.

1078
01:25:54,316 --> 01:25:55,488
Like they always did.

1079
01:25:56,318 --> 01:25:57,296
But now

1080
01:25:58,520 --> 01:25:59,658
you can call us

1081
01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:03,025
father and mother, all right?

1082
01:26:03,225 --> 01:26:03,999
Why?

1083
01:26:05,727 --> 01:26:06,705
It doesn't matter.

1084
01:26:07,529 --> 01:26:10,032
You want to explain it to me
because it doesn't matter

1085
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:18,746
- One day you'll understand.
- Why?

1086
01:26:20,075 --> 01:26:21,247
It doesn't matter.

1087
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:23,955
It doesn't?

1088
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:25,253
Why?

1089
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:34,189
- That's what I'm wondering also.
- Why?

1090
01:27:00,582 --> 01:27:01,822
Brush your teeth.

1091
01:27:03,385 --> 01:27:04,125
Here.

1092
01:27:13,762 --> 01:27:15,264
It's better like this.

1093
01:27:44,626 --> 01:27:45,661
Let's see,

1094
01:27:46,461 --> 01:27:47,303
what's the matter?

1095
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:56,408
Did you hurt yourself?

1096
01:27:56,838 --> 01:27:57,782
All right.

1097
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:00,977
Let's see what we can do about it.

1098
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:13,429
Here?

1099
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:16,594
Is it here, here, here?

1100
01:28:19,194 --> 01:28:20,502
Are you all right now?

1101
01:28:45,787 --> 01:28:48,267
August

1102
01:28:52,627 --> 01:28:55,665
Utsunomiya
Engineering Department?

1103
01:28:56,631 --> 01:28:57,405
<i>Yes.</i>

1104
01:28:59,401 --> 01:29:02,075
Why are you sending me?
Nohara could take care of it.

1105
01:29:02,571 --> 01:29:03,345
Well...

1106
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:08,351
The trial date is drawing near,
there's little time left.

1107
01:29:09,811 --> 01:29:11,188
I am sorry, sir,

1108
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:13,860
but I am the plaintiff.

1109
01:29:14,049 --> 01:29:15,892
Yes, I know that very well.

1110
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:18,854
You see,

1111
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:21,960
you've always stepped on the gas.

1112
01:29:23,358 --> 01:29:25,429
There are moments
when one should push the brakes

1113
01:29:25,827 --> 01:29:28,239
But you are where you are
because you didn't push the brakes.

1114
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:30,703
<i>It wasn't the same thing,
times are changing.</i>

1115
01:29:31,733 --> 01:29:34,111
<i>Try spending more time
with your family.</i>

1116
01:29:38,273 --> 01:29:41,083
The ramen boxes
can be blue or red.

1117
01:29:43,211 --> 01:29:45,714
- And which do you like best?
- I like the red ones.

1118
01:29:47,682 --> 01:29:49,184
The red ones are with soy sauce.

1119
01:29:50,552 --> 01:29:52,361
- Isn't it so?
- I don't know.

1120
01:29:59,961 --> 01:30:00,769
Yes?

1121
01:30:14,676 --> 01:30:18,055
<i>Father hasn't arrived yet,
we won't tell any one.</i>

1122
01:30:25,987 --> 01:30:27,796
Why did you draw this?

1123
01:30:29,291 --> 01:30:30,497
You made mother cry.

1124
01:30:33,495 --> 01:30:34,906
Did you ask her to forgive you?

1125
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:36,572
No?

1126
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:42,278
Very well.

1127
01:30:43,104 --> 01:30:44,276
Go to bed.

1128
01:30:46,107 --> 01:30:47,950
Aren't you saying good night?

1129
01:30:49,177 --> 01:30:50,554
Good night.

1130
01:31:00,922 --> 01:31:03,698
"Father Mother"

1131
01:31:26,448 --> 01:31:27,483
You are making noise.

1132
01:31:33,121 --> 01:31:34,361
I said enough!

1133
01:32:14,796 --> 01:32:15,604
That's too much.

1134
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:19,345
This doesn't work,
this is broken.

1135
01:32:20,568 --> 01:32:22,377
Tell your mother
to buy you another one.

1136
01:32:26,508 --> 01:32:29,045
When I go back home,
daddy will fix it.

1137
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:30,549
Ryusei.

1138
01:32:38,853 --> 01:32:41,026
You'll never go back
to that house.

1139
01:32:43,091 --> 01:32:45,071
From now on, you'll be living here.

1140
01:32:48,596 --> 01:32:50,576
I am your real father.

1141
01:32:56,404 --> 01:32:57,644
Let me see it.

1142
01:34:36,971 --> 01:34:41,283
I've just told you have won,
but it doesn't seem to make you too happy.

1143
01:34:42,143 --> 01:34:44,180
I haven't won, nor have I lost.

1144
01:34:45,813 --> 01:34:47,417
Well, in many trials,

1145
01:34:47,615 --> 01:34:50,289
it is not too obvious
who wins and who loses.

1146
01:34:52,220 --> 01:34:54,700
No, that's not I mean.

1147
01:34:56,658 --> 01:34:58,194
It doesn't sound like you,

1148
01:34:59,661 --> 01:35:01,766
you could start with agreeing with me.

1149
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:06,273
I don't do it to agree with you.

1150
01:35:07,435 --> 01:35:09,506
Do you care what others think?

1151
01:35:09,737 --> 01:35:11,683
You've really changed a lot.

1152
01:35:15,076 --> 01:35:16,248
I almost forgot.

1153
01:35:18,846 --> 01:35:19,722
Here.

1154
01:35:21,182 --> 01:35:22,684
The nurse gave it to me.

1155
01:35:23,351 --> 01:35:25,558
Besides what the hospital gave,

1156
01:35:27,455 --> 01:35:31,130
that's the most she can give
in good faith.

1157
01:35:43,705 --> 01:35:44,979
Good afternoon.

1158
01:35:45,974 --> 01:35:47,146
Good afternoon.

1159
01:35:49,877 --> 01:35:50,617
Listen,

1160
01:35:51,980 --> 01:35:53,482
I came to give it back to you.

1161
01:35:57,685 --> 01:35:59,096
I'm very sorry.

1162
01:36:01,789 --> 01:36:03,166
What you did

1163
01:36:04,525 --> 01:36:06,471
destroyed my family.

1164
01:36:10,164 --> 01:36:11,336
Teru.

1165
01:36:13,067 --> 01:36:14,910
It has nothing to do with you.

1166
01:36:15,803 --> 01:36:17,339
It has.

1167
01:36:18,906 --> 01:36:20,180
She's my mother.

1168
01:37:28,343 --> 01:37:30,914
<i>Nonomiya residence, hello.</i>

1169
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:33,215
It's Ryota.

1170
01:37:33,614 --> 01:37:37,084
<i>Ryota, what do you know?...
Thanks for coming the other day.</i>

1171
01:37:40,888 --> 01:37:41,696
Listen.

1172
01:37:42,523 --> 01:37:43,866
<i>Shall I call your father'?</i>

1173
01:37:44,859 --> 01:37:45,599
No.

1174
01:37:49,497 --> 01:37:51,101
I've called to ask for forgiveness.

1175
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:56,345
<i>No, Ryota,
don't get serious at this time.</i>

1176
01:37:58,206 --> 01:37:59,412
It's for back then.

1177
01:37:59,841 --> 01:38:03,414
<i>I don't want to go back,
it's past history.</i>

1178
01:38:04,011 --> 01:38:07,117
<i>I want to talk trivial things
with you, it doesn't matter.</i>

1179
01:38:07,315 --> 01:38:11,388
<i>What star wears a whig
and what other had surgery.</i>

1180
01:38:14,622 --> 01:38:15,794
All right.

1181
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:22,273
<i>Your father's calling me
there's no saké lefi.</i>

1182
01:38:29,203 --> 01:38:29,943
Very well.

1183
01:38:32,206 --> 01:38:32,946
I understand.

1184
01:38:41,382 --> 01:38:44,158
<i>We are using much less water
in the Green Roof project,</i>

1185
01:38:44,385 --> 01:38:46,831
<i>now that we are channelling
the rain water.</i>

1186
01:38:48,289 --> 01:38:50,269
<i>If we add all the water used</i>

1187
01:38:50,458 --> 01:38:52,802
<i>at irrigating the plants
and filling the trench,</i>

1188
01:38:53,294 --> 01:38:55,797
<i>we don't go over
42.6 cubic meters.</i>

1189
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:20,655
I have also started

1190
01:39:21,823 --> 01:39:23,803
as an architect, same as you have.

1191
01:39:27,328 --> 01:39:30,207
This forest was created for man,

1192
01:39:30,665 --> 01:39:32,372
for research.

1193
01:39:41,342 --> 01:39:42,514
And this,

1194
01:39:44,345 --> 01:39:45,619
was born here?

1195
01:39:46,514 --> 01:39:47,356
<i>Yes.</i>

1196
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:52,490
Insects reproduce themselves
easily here.

1197
01:39:54,021 --> 01:39:56,831
But fifteen years are needed
from the moment

1198
01:39:57,792 --> 01:39:59,794
a cicada lays eggs

1199
01:40:00,361 --> 01:40:03,467
until they turn into larvae
and get out from the ground.

1200
01:40:04,632 --> 01:40:05,804
That much?!

1201
01:40:10,972 --> 01:40:12,315
Do you think it's a long time?

1202
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:40,470
Hello.

1203
01:41:54,241 --> 01:41:56,778
<i>I'm sorry, it's me, Nonomiya.</i>

1204
01:41:59,747 --> 01:42:01,920
<i>I'm sorry for being late.</i>

1205
01:42:02,416 --> 01:42:03,827
<i>Hi, what's the matter'?</i>

1206
01:42:05,453 --> 01:42:08,696
<i>Apparently,
he decided he wanted to ﬂy a kite.</i>

1207
01:42:09,624 --> 01:42:10,625
<i>A kite?!</i>

1208
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:14,204
<i>He sneaked into the suburbs
train behind an adult.</i>

1209
01:42:14,795 --> 01:42:17,639
<i>That's smart,
he's very good at this kind of things.</i>

1210
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:21,370
<i>That's nothing to be proud of.</i>

1211
01:42:22,169 --> 01:42:24,809
- You should have punished him.
- What's your suggestion?

1212
01:42:25,773 --> 01:42:28,151
That we should have sent him back
on an empty stomach?

1213
01:42:28,442 --> 01:42:29,716
That's not the way we are.

1214
01:42:30,611 --> 01:42:32,522
I understand your point of view.

1215
01:42:34,348 --> 01:42:35,952
If you think he doesn't adapt,

1216
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:38,790
he can stay with us for a while.

1217
01:42:38,986 --> 01:42:39,726
Of course.

1218
01:42:39,954 --> 01:42:43,834
We have no problems
with having both Ryusei and Keita.

1219
01:42:47,361 --> 01:42:48,704
Everything will be fine.

1220
01:42:50,197 --> 01:42:51,505
I'll take care of that.

1221
01:42:55,836 --> 01:42:56,746
RYusei!

1222
01:42:58,105 --> 01:42:59,413
Ryusei, let's go home!

1223
01:43:14,321 --> 01:43:15,664
You don't have

1224
01:43:16,691 --> 01:43:20,104
to call us
father and mother right away.

1225
01:43:34,175 --> 01:43:36,212
Take your bath
and stop fooling around.

1226
01:43:50,825 --> 01:43:51,895
Keita.

1227
01:44:16,784 --> 01:44:18,422
If I caress him like this,

1228
01:44:21,088 --> 01:44:22,260
it's like

1229
01:44:24,792 --> 01:44:26,135
it was you.

1230
01:44:31,298 --> 01:44:33,107
I also ran away from home.

1231
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:40,141
I wanted to see my mother.

1232
01:44:48,649 --> 01:44:51,789
But my father came immediately
and dragged me home.

1233
01:45:30,825 --> 01:45:33,362
- <i>And now what?</i>
- <i>Let's go to father!</i>

1234
01:45:57,184 --> 01:45:58,254
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1235
01:46:00,688 --> 01:46:01,564
RYusei!

1236
01:46:01,755 --> 01:46:03,632
Ryusei, Ryusei, are you all right?

1237
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:13,838
Father!

1238
01:46:14,435 --> 01:46:15,379
Are you hurt?

1239
01:46:15,703 --> 01:46:17,205
Father, are you hurt?

1240
01:46:17,571 --> 01:46:18,549
Enough now!

1241
01:46:20,875 --> 01:46:21,853
Careful!

1242
01:46:39,894 --> 01:46:41,396
<i>You are going to win,
you are going to win!</i>

1243
01:46:43,964 --> 01:46:44,908
I've won!

1244
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:48,637
- Did you find it?
- Where was it?

1245
01:46:50,004 --> 01:46:52,245
- The smallest one.
- Thank you very much.

1246
01:46:55,643 --> 01:46:57,748
On your marks, attention...

1247
01:46:57,945 --> 01:46:58,980
Go!

1248
01:47:04,051 --> 01:47:05,894
- You've fished your father.
- Careful.

1249
01:47:35,616 --> 01:47:36,959
Cancer, Scorpio,

1250
01:47:37,785 --> 01:47:38,786
Gemini.

1251
01:47:40,955 --> 01:47:42,127
Sagittarius.

1252
01:47:42,957 --> 01:47:43,833
Libra.

1253
01:47:45,659 --> 01:47:46,797
Aquarius.

1254
01:47:48,395 --> 01:47:49,533
- Virgo.
- Look...

1255
01:47:49,697 --> 01:47:51,267
A shooting star...

1256
01:47:51,966 --> 01:47:53,343
Make a wish.

1257
01:48:02,676 --> 01:48:04,519
What have you asked the star for?

1258
01:48:05,479 --> 01:48:08,187
That I may go back with father and mother.

1259
01:48:10,084 --> 01:48:11,290
Ryusei.

1260
01:48:16,657 --> 01:48:17,795
I'm sorry.

1261
01:48:21,328 --> 01:48:22,534
It's nothing.

1262
01:48:24,732 --> 01:48:25,870
It's nothing.

1263
01:48:50,724 --> 01:48:51,725
What happened?

1264
01:48:55,863 --> 01:48:57,934
Now I love Ryusei too.

1265
01:49:03,270 --> 01:49:04,078
Why are you crying,

1266
01:49:05,739 --> 01:49:06,911
then?

1267
01:49:08,942 --> 01:49:10,012
Because

1268
01:49:12,446 --> 01:49:14,517
I feel awful about Keita.

1269
01:49:17,951 --> 01:49:20,124
It's like I'm betraying him.

1270
01:49:24,458 --> 01:49:26,267
I wonder how Keita's feeling?

1271
01:51:09,196 --> 01:51:10,869
<i>Do you want to have breakfast'?</i>

1272
01:51:18,071 --> 01:51:19,550
Don't you want to eat?

1273
01:52:08,622 --> 01:52:09,930
Welcome.

1274
01:52:10,457 --> 01:52:12,903
Bulbs, isn't it?
How many watts?

1275
01:52:14,294 --> 01:52:16,274
- I'm back home.
- Welcome home.

1276
01:52:16,463 --> 01:52:17,942
Ryusei, what's the matter?

1277
01:52:18,298 --> 01:52:19,276
Keita.

1278
01:52:21,468 --> 01:52:22,276
Keita!

1279
01:52:22,636 --> 01:52:23,614
Keita!

1280
01:53:08,415 --> 01:53:09,450
Keita!

1281
01:53:11,785 --> 01:53:12,923
Forgive me.

1282
01:53:14,621 --> 01:53:15,622
Daddy

1283
01:53:18,292 --> 01:53:19,965
couldn't go along without
seeing you any longer.

1284
01:53:20,794 --> 01:53:22,705
I've broken the rules to see you.

1285
01:53:23,430 --> 01:53:25,535
Father is not my father any more.

1286
01:53:30,137 --> 01:53:31,377
You are right.

1287
01:53:32,806 --> 01:53:34,149
But, listen,

1288
01:53:35,442 --> 01:53:36,750
during six years...

1289
01:53:38,111 --> 01:53:39,988
I was your father during six years.

1290
01:53:42,049 --> 01:53:43,357
I was not a good father,

1291
01:53:44,051 --> 01:53:45,553
but I was your father.

1292
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:53,502
The flower you gave me...

1293
01:53:58,031 --> 01:53:59,669
I'm sorry, but I lost it.

1294
01:54:05,172 --> 01:54:06,310
I am sorry.

1295
01:54:11,845 --> 01:54:13,017
In the camera

1296
01:54:15,982 --> 01:54:18,189
are all the photos you
took of me.

1297
01:54:29,062 --> 01:54:30,336
And the piano...

1298
01:54:34,067 --> 01:54:36,047
Father also stopped
playing the piano.

1299
01:54:47,214 --> 01:54:48,284
Listen,

1300
01:54:50,384 --> 01:54:52,261
the mission is over.

1301
01:55:44,504 --> 01:55:45,812
They are back already.

1302
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:55,320
Welcome.

1303
01:56:19,539 --> 01:56:20,381
Come on.

1304
01:56:21,808 --> 01:56:22,650
Yes.

1305
01:56:34,221 --> 01:56:36,531
- Let's go inside.
- Yes, let's go inside.

1306
01:56:40,494 --> 01:56:43,498
Did you know Spiderman
really is a spider?

1307
01:56:46,199 --> 01:56:47,542
I had no idea.
