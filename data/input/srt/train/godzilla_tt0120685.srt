00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,406
Damn! How do you say "permit"?
I have a permit.

2
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:33,410
- Dr. Niko Tapopopolis?
- It's Tatopoulos.

3
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:37,747
Kyle Terrington.
I'm with the U.S. State Department.

4
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,461
- What are they doing?
- You're being reassigned.

5
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:46,339
- But my work here isn't finished.
- It is now.

6
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,745
There's pressure
from the Americans.

7
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,288
What have you told them?

8
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,831
Nothing yet.

9
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,083
Are there any survivors?

10
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,962
Only one, sir. He was lucky.

11
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,597
Get them out.

12
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,783
Ask him what happened.

13
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:11,049
What did you see, old man?

14
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,744
That's affirmative.

15
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,498
Hey, where are you going
with my stuff?

16
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:49,921
Hello. Hello.
That's very delicate.

17
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,840
Thank you.

18
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,343
- Dr. Niko Topodopeless?
- Tatopoulos.

19
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,805
Whatever. Come on,
get these people off of the pier!

20
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:03,435
- Sir, what am I doing here?
- Watch your step. Don't talk to anybody.

21
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,896
Come on, get them off the damn pier!

22
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:12,193
- What is all this, some kind of spill?
- Something like that.

23
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,322
Look, I work for the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission...

24
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,699
...but accidents
and spills aren't my field.

25
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,534
We know.

26
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,996
You know you've interrupted a 3-year
study of the Chernobyl earthworm?

27
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,040
Yeah, you're the worm guy, right?

28
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:30,545
The radioactive contamination in that
area has mutated the earthworm's DNA.

29
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:34,007
- You know what that means?
- I got a feeling I'm about to find out.

30
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,468
It means, because of a
man-made accident...

31
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,597
...the Chernobyl earthworms are now
17% larger than they were before.

32
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:44,559
- Seventeen percent? Sounds pretty big.
- They're enormous.

33
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,103
That's what I'm saying.
I'm a biologist.

34
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,898
I take radioactive samples
and I study them.

35
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:54,069
- Great. Here's your sample. Study it.
- What sample?

36
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:59,324
- You're standing in it.
- I don't see it.

37
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,037
Where is it?

38
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,998
I don't see it.

39
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,594
Colonel! Colonel!

40
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:24,099
That was a footprint!
I was standing inside of a footprint!

41
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,393
That's right.

42
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,940
But there's no animal in the world that
makes footprints like that, is there?

43
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:36,194
I told them this is not your field,
but they never listen to genius.

44
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,447
This is Elsie Chapman, of the
National Institute of Palaeontology.

45
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,865
She's your boss.

46
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,410
- Those were footprints, right?
- Yes, they were.

47
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,203
Did anybody see what made them?

48
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:49,499
Actually, no such luck.

49
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,378
It happened so fast, nobody knew
what hit them until it was over.

50
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,922
- Elsie.
- Yeah?

51
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:00,135
The tape's in.
The French finally released it.

52
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,179
This is a Japanese cannery ship...

53
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,807
...that was attacked and sunk
near French Polynesia.

54
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,894
We believe it's connected. Dr. Craven,
have you met the worm guy?

55
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,898
Sorry. Summer cold.

56
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:54,647
- Come on, all right?
- Have a nice day.

57
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,571
Wait, wait, wait!

58
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:10,038
- They say it'll rain all week.
- What's with the bags?

59
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:14,959
- Caiman's groceries.
- Oh, girl.

60
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,838
- Speak of the devil.
- What?

61
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:22,550
This is the midget version.
This makes me look like a professional.

62
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,719
Can we put this on the 5, please?

63
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,888
- You think I should ask him?
- No.

64
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,140
- I'm gonna ask him.
- No!

65
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,519
- I will.
- Audrey.

66
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,690
- Did you talk with Humphries?
- This is not the place.

67
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:41,361
- Just tell me. Did you talk with him?
- It's between you and Rodriguez.

68
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:45,448
You serious? He's gonna consider me
for the job? What else did he say?

69
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:50,328
Why don't we talk about it
over dinner tonight? Your place.

70
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,915
- Mr. Caiman, you're married.
- Yes, and you're very beautiful.

71
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,418
- Have I ever told you that before?
- Mr. Caiman!

72
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,921
I've been doing research for you...

73
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,340
...after hours and weekends
for over three years.

74
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,593
This is a very important job to me.

75
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,595
I'm too old to be
your assistant anymore.

76
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,848
I need to know this job
is going someplace.

77
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,851
So have dinner with me tonight.

78
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,353
I can't.

79
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,106
It's your choice.

80
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,441
- Okay, let's go.
- Charlie.

81
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,027
Say hello to your new co-anchor,
Ms. Desireé Pon.

82
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,446
Hello, Desireé, welcome aboard.

83
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,202
Mark, can I have a pillow,
phone book, something?

84
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,246
- Three, two...

85
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:38,710
Hello, New York. Today at 5 we'll
ask Fat Pat when the rain will end.

86
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:47,302
So three years digging up worms
in Chernobyl?

87
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:53,141
- How did Mrs. Tatapolis handle it?
- Tatopoulos. I'm actually not married.

88
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:59,731
- Really? A girlfriend, or...?
- No. Perhaps I work too much.

89
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,317
So do you mean to tell me
there's no one...

90
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:05,194
...who holds a special place
in your heart?

91
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,491
No. Not for a long time now.

92
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:15,330
Well, you may be the wrong man
for the job, but I think you're cute.

93
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,335
Thank you.

94
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,174
She thinks I'm cute.

95
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,439
Who the hell are they?

96
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,236
- Get those people out of there.
- They're with me.

97
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,572
Is that right? Who are you?

98
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,242
La Rochelle Casualty
and Property Insurance.

99
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,119
We're preparing our report.

100
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:39,080
- You're pretty damn fast.
- That's our job.

101
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:42,250
Your people are getting
in the way of my job.

102
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,336
Colonel, what do you think
could have done this?

103
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:51,926
Listen, Mr. Roach, you get your
people out of here, or I will.

104
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:36,846
The captain's getting some coffee.
Then he's gonna kick your asses.

105
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,765
Well, I'm in for a buck.

106
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,405
What the hell
is that dope-head doing?

107
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:04,332
Artie, what the hell's wrong?
Why are we slowing down?

108
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,504
I don't know, she's at full throttle.
Maybe she's heavy in the net.

109
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:27,021
- How come we stopped? Nets full?
- I don't think so.

110
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,524
We must be caught on something.

111
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,944
Bring in the nets. Bring them up!
Pull them in now.

112
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,447
- What's going on?
- We're bringing them in.

113
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,699
The engines are heating up.

114
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,953
- Should I shut them down?
- No, keep pulling.

115
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,917
I'm trying! I'm trying!

116
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,214
Cut them loose!

117
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,180
Look out!

118
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,897
Cut them loose now!

119
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,775
Hurry! Hurry!

120
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,740
She's going down!

121
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,698
Do you hear that?

122
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,897
Excuse me, sir. We just got a report
of three fishing trawlers going down.

123
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:38,069
- What makes you think it's related?
- The trawlers were pulled under, sir.

124
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,533
Jesus Christ...

125
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,161
It's only 200 miles off
the Eastern seaboard...

126
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,080
...and we don't even know what it is.

127
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,748
- Theropoda allosaurus.
- What?

128
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,250
A type of enormous reptile...

129
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,919
...that we believed
died out in the Cretaceous Period.

130
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,630
So where's it been hiding
the last 60 million years?

131
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,216
What about the traces of radiation?

132
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,513
The radiation isn't an anomaly.
It's the clue.

133
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,975
This animal is much too big
to be some kind of lost dinosaur.

134
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,686
Don't tell me what it isn't,
tell me what it is.

135
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,355
Well, what do we know?

136
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:21,028
It was first sighted off of
the French Polynesian Pacific.

137
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:25,032
That area has been exposed
to dozens of nuclear tests.

138
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,369
- Hence the radiation.
- More than that.

139
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:31,872
I believe it's a mutated aberration.

140
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,959
A hybrid caused by the fallout
on these islands.

141
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,961
Like your earthworms?

142
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,463
Yes. Yes.

143
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,634
We're looking at a completely
incipient creature.

144
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,512
The dawn of a new species.

145
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,223
The first of its kind.

146
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:09,076
- My life sucks.
- Oh, please.

147
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:13,497
- Your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.
- Because I'm married to you.

148
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,583
I cannot believe
he put the moves on me.

149
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,460
After everything I've done for him.

150
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,420
He is scum.

151
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,757
To him, you're just
a pair of breasts that talk.

152
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:26,761
- Hey, there's an image.
- I'm telling you, he is dirt.

153
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:29,805
He's a douche-bag, gutter-slime'
dog-crap puke-chunks.

154
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,766
Hey, you don't see I'm eating?

155
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,478
Audrey, you're too damn nice.

156
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:39,940
That's your problem.
Nice gets you nothing in this town.

157
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,778
It's dog-eat-dog.
You gotta be a killer to get ahead.

158
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:47,948
I'm sorry, baby, but you just
don't got what it takes.

159
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:53,287
- Do you think that's true?
- Pretty much. You're a nice person.

160
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,374
Nice guys finish last.

161
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,795
- I can be tough if I want.
- Yeah, sure.

162
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:04,298
I can. I can.

163
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:08,010
- No, yeah, no.
- Whatever.

164
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,805
Oh, my God!

165
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:15,142
Oh, my God!
Could you turn that up please?

166
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:20,481
- Sometime in the last 12 hours.
It is not known yet...

167
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,651
- It's Nick.
- Who is he?

168
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:27,988
He was my college sweetie.
He looks so handsome on TV.

169
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:31,575
There is tight security
around the crash site...

170
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:36,831
...possibly due to the sensitive
military cargo on the plane.

171
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:51,178
You wanna unload this thing?
I'm getting soaked here.

172
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,222
Come on, will you?

173
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,273
Hey, Joe! Gonna catch one of them
little fish in the East River?

174
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,275
I hope so.

175
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,610
But you never know.

176
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,905
I mean, today could be my lucky day.

177
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:12,366
The only thing you'll catch is a cold.

178
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,589
Hey.

179
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,260
I got a bite.

180
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:36,640
Boy, do I have a bite!

181
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:43,522
Don't let up on him, Joe.
You got a big one, baby. Hold on to it.

182
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,900
You want to fight?

183
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,919
Here he is, ladies and gentlemen,
the man you've all been waiting for.

184
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:33,090
Yours for a safer New York,
your mayor, Mayor Ebert!

185
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,469
Thank you. Thank you.

186
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:42,558
I want to thank you all for coming out
on this beautiful New York City day.

187
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:48,522
Four years ago, people didn't think
I would reduce crime.

188
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,233
But I did!

189
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,046
Oh, my God.

190
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,899
Move! Let's get out of here!

191
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,703
I'm grateful we're getting a new set.

192
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,414
I know that represents a
commitment from management.

193
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,375
Here's what I don't understand:

194
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,460
Why we're the only station in town...

195
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,588
...that doesn't have the Korean
grocery holdup as our lead.

196
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,633
- What's our lead? Rain, again!
- Mom?

197
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:01,428
I know, it impresses the people at the
parties you go to that we're classy.

198
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,348
Sorry, I just don't give
a rat's ass about a war...

199
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,518
...in some country whose name
I can't even pronounce.

200
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:12,022
- How about a real story?
- Sir?

201
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,776
I think your story
just walked by the window.

202
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,823
What?

203
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:25,035
Maybe we can get in the Korean
grocer's hospital room.

204
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:29,289
- So did this Romeo have a name?
- Nick Tatopoulos.

205
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:32,710
- Jesus. Is that why you dumped him?
- No.

206
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:37,464
- How long did you go out for anyway?
- Nearly four years.

207
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:40,467
Girl, I'm surprised he didn't
ask you to marry him.

208
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:43,137
Well, that's the problem.

209
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,805
He did.

210
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,184
Tell me that's not another parade.

211
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,479
I don't think that's a parade.

212
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,276
Please stand by.

213
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,695
What the hell is that?

214
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,168
Are you all right? Are you cut?
You all right?

215
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,673
Victor! Don't be stupid.

216
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,844
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
That is really...

217
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:27,681
That is large.

218
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,267
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God!

219
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,940
Come on, you bastard. Come on!

220
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:41,570
Victor, get back here, you retard!

221
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:52,372
Somebody do something!

222
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,757
Come on! Come on!

223
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,527
Can you tell us what's going on?

224
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,112
Watch it!

225
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:21,295
- Sergeant O'Neal, sir.
- Any word from the mayor's office?

226
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:25,299
Yes, sir. They've agreed to evacuate the
city. They've called the National Guard.

227
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,885
Evacuate Manhattan?
That's over 3 million people.

228
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,554
- Has that ever been done before?
- I don't think so.

229
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:34,558
- Where is he now?
- We lost sight of it, sir.

230
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,977
You wanna run that by me again?

231
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:41,481
After its initial attack, he...

232
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,151
...disappeared.

233
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,987
Secretary of Defense Burk
is on the line.

234
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,658
I don't understand. How can
something so big just disappear?

235
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,493
- We're not sure, but...
- Yeah, yeah.

236
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:57,164
- He probably returned to the river.
- I don't think so.

237
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:03,462
I mean, look at it. It's perfect.
An island, water on all sides.

238
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:10,761
But like no other island in the world'
it's a place where he can easily hide.

239
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,096
He's in there someplace.

240
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,932
Channel 12 caught it on tape.

241
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:19,853
Hello, I'm Charles Caiman,
in the WIDF news center.

242
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:23,523
Ladies and gentlemen, we New Υorkers
like to think we've seen it all...

243
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:27,861
...but what you're going to see now
will shock you beyond belief.

244
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:31,198
This is footage we have
that indicates...

245
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:34,534
...that there is a dinosaur
loose in Manhattan.

246
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:38,956
WIDF's exclusive footage was shot
barely half an hour ago.

247
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:44,127
WIDF cameraman, Victor "Animal"
Palotti, surνived unharmed.

248
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,048
You are so great.

249
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:50,467
Great stuff, Animal.
Weren't you scared?

250
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,844
Yeah, I thought Lucy
was gonna kill me.

251
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:55,764
- Damn right, you crazy wop.
- Okay, people.

252
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,976
- What were you thinking?
- We have to be completely relocated...

253
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,896
...to the New Jersey station
for the 10:00 broadcast. Animal!

254
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:06,817
You're riding in the chopper
with Caiman. Now. Let's go, lift off.

255
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:11,405
- Are you going to be all right?
- Yeah. Audrey's gonna spend the night.

256
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:15,575
A threesome. That's excellent.
I'm a little tired, but...

257
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:18,996
Dozens of people are reported killed,
thousands injured.

258
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:22,124
Civil defense stations are
being set up throughout Manhattan.

259
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:25,085
But in addition, city, military
and health officials...

260
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,796
...are setting up a command post
on the Jersey shore...

261
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,840
...in anticipation of an evacuation...

262
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,093
- My bag. My bag!
- Mr. Caiman.

263
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,095
Mr. Caiman, wait.

264
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,931
Mr. Caiman, I've got a lead.

265
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,434
I know a guy who's
on the inside with the military.

266
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:43,437
- Not now.
- I can get great inside information.

267
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,440
Look. This is the moment When
the big boys go to Work, okay?

268
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,150
The bag.

269
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:03,832
- This is crazy. Come on, let's go.
- Wait up.

270
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,126
Come on.

271
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,295
Wait up.

272
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:14,426
- Can we get a cab?
- Audrey, what are you thinking?

273
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:18,138
Move, move!
On the sidewalk, right now!

274
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,984
In what city officials
are describing as...

275
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:34,321
...the worst act of destruction since
the World Trade Center bombing...

276
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,365
...hundreds of thousands
have jammed the streets...

277
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:40,494
...in the largest evacuation
in this city's history.

278
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:41,995
And many people...

279
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,123
Many, many people
are not happy about it.

280
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:48,668
Among those unhappy citizens
are the managers of the stores...

281
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,837
...along pricey 5th and Madison Ave.

282
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:54,674
The Warner Bros. And Disney stores
have been cleared out by looters.

283
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,552
The streets are jammed.
Traffic's at a standstill.

284
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,181
Emergency vehicles cannot have access
to emergencies that may develop.

285
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:04,518
There's a slow but steady stream
out of the city...

286
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:09,106
...as if Long Island or New Jersey
were any refuge in this time of crisis.

287
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:12,025
This is great. If I'm wrong
on this evacuation...

288
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,653
...they'll string me up
from the Liberty torch.

289
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:18,865
Didn't we agreed we weren't gonna have
any sw eets until after the election?

290
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,827
Back off, Gene.

291
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,260
Who the hell are they?

292
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:41,471
A contingent of building oWners
and business representatives.

293
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:45,225
- I don't have time for this nonsense.
- Campaign contributors.

294
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,894
Ladies and gentlemen,
I share your concerns.

295
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:52,566
I want to get this city back in business
as soon as possible. Please.

296
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:59,239
La Rochelle Insurance. We represent
nearly 13% of the buildings in your city.

297
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:02,242
You can count on our emotional
and financial support.

298
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,910
Well, thank you. Thank you.

299
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,662
What do you plan to do?

300
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,801
- Coming through.
- Where's your ID?

301
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:22,637
- What's wrong? Don't you watch TV?
- You gotta have press ID.

302
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:25,765
I've got ID. I had a badge on my bag.

303
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,768
I don't know if this is a good idea.

304
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,229
What are you talking about?
You stole it.

305
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:34,274
Finally you got a little chutzpah.
Don't wimp out.

306
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,610
- What if Caiman finds out?
- Look.

307
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:40,447
How often do you think you'll have
an ex-boyfriend inside a major story?

308
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,491
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

309
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,161
If you stick this thing...

310
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,206
Have you got any glue or something?

311
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:53,376
I'm sorry, I left my forgery kit
back at the office.

312
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,661
- No croissant?
- No, monsieur.

313
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:36,544
- You call this coffee?
- No, I call this America.

314
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,800
Sorry, Mr. Mayor, that's where
we are at this point.

315
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,510
Now, hold on. Hold on.

316
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:48,265
You're telling me, in an election month
I evacuated this city for nothing?

317
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:52,185
Do you realize what this evacuation
will cost the people of this city?

318
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,854
We've been monitoring
all the waters around the island.

319
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,607
As far as we can tell'
this thing has not left the area.

320
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,735
- But you don't know for sure.
- We have reason to believe...

321
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:03,863
...it may be hiding in
a building in the restricted area.

322
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:06,199
- But you don't know for sure!
- Mr. Mayor.

323
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:11,371
We cannot give the all-clear until each
and every building has been checked.

324
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,540
- What is it?
- Excuse me, sir.

325
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,750
That may be more difficult
than we projected.

326
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:19,546
Terrific. Terrific! More good news!

327
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,550
We've run into a problem.

328
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,094
- Do you believe this?
- I don't know what's going on.

329
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,221
- You never know what's going on.
- Thank you.

330
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,983
- Right here, sir.
- Have them fall in.

331
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,902
Let's go, people, fall in downstairs.

332
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:10,305
Lieutenant Anderson and his men
found this, this afternoon.

333
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:18,772
We were checking the building above
and we discovered the floor was gone.

334
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:22,359
When we discovered that he could
burrow his way through the tunnels...

335
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:26,404
...we realized he could be
outside the quarantine zone.

336
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,114
Holy Christ.

337
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:33,119
- How many tunnels lead off the island?
- Only 14. He hasn't used any of them.

338
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:36,164
- Have them all sealed up.
- Yes, sir.

339
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,627
How? How would we do that, sir?

340
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:46,049
Fill them with cement, brick them up,
put landmines in them. I don't care!

341
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,885
Make sure the damn thing
doesn't leave the island.

342
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,895
You know, he's not some enemy
trying to evade you.

343
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,563
He's just an animal.

344
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,524
What are you suggesting?

345
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,943
Well, when I had to
catch earthworms...

346
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:07,987
...I knew the best way to get them
was not to dig them out...

347
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,614
...but to draw them out.

348
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:15,620
All we need to do is to find out
what he needs, and he'll come to you.

349
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:38,435
- Where are they now?
- Delta Niner, where is the convoy?

350
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,687
Command, they've just
entered the city.

351
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,994
I have no contact with the convoy.
I'm expecting ground confirmation.

352
00:40:56,162 --> 00:41:00,206
- Sir, convoy ETA is 10 minutes.
- We've got to hurry.

353
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:04,711
Man your positions. Ten minutes ETΑ.
Go, go, go! All systems go.

354
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,974
Is it good?

355
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,895
Let's go, let's go!
Come on, move it through!

356
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,195
We have picture.
You can leave, Jean Luc.

357
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,405
We have a signal, sir.

358
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,246
You said this was French Roast!

359
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:48,129
More cream.

360
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:06,105
Bring them in. Come on,
bring it back!

361
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:13,071
- I sure hope this plan of yours works.
- I'm kind of hoping that myself.

362
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,866
- Did you approve this?
- They just appropriated it.

363
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,910
Twelve of the city's dump trucks.

364
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,204
Would you like to tell me
what's going on here?

365
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,791
Actually, no, I wouldn't.
And don't touch anything.

366
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:28,002
- How's O'Neal doing?
- Everything is on schedule, sir.

367
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:31,881
- Sure you didn't know about this?
- No one told me anything about this.

368
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,008
Why do I even keep you around?

369
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,183
Dump!

370
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:54,028
No. Very clever.

371
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,993
All right, let's pile it on,
and let's get out of here.

372
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,832
That's a lot of fish.

373
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,820
Come on, you bastard,
it's suppertime.

374
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:41,492
Look at all that frigging fish.
Is this gonna work?

375
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:04,932
We gotta get the manholes uncovered.
We want him to smell the bait.

376
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,726
Come on.

377
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:10,104
Let's go! Let's go!

378
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,569
Come on, guys.

379
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:23,951
- Let's get those lids off. Go, go!
- What the hell is he doing?

380
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:27,705
- Okay, this way, this way. Come on.
- Let's go!

381
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,749
Come on. Over there!

382
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,086
- This one.
- Yes, sir.

383
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,468
- Give me the crowbar.
- Sir.

384
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:32,413
Set up here. I've got a shot.

385
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,193
This is Six Alpha Charlie.

386
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:05,530
We gotta move.
We can't stay put, we gotta move!

387
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:03,921
Let's go, fall back!

388
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,971
Go, go, go!

389
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,645
We need bigger guns.

390
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,983
- We've lost communications.
- Get us back online. Fire at will!

391
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,610
Sergeant, fire at will!

392
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,778
Fire! Fire! Fire!

393
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,664
O'Neal, you better tell me
what's going on.

394
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:23,542
He's gone, sir, he's gone.
Echo unit in pursuit.

395
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:37,723
Follow my lead.

396
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:53,823
All systems armed. Echo 4 armed.

397
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:02,623
We're doing 80 knots
and he's pulling away, sir.

398
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,126
I've got him locked on.

399
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:08,546
- Locked on, sir. Target is locked on.
- Fire the damn missile.

400
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,716
- Echo 1 through 4, fire at will.
- Fire sidewinders.

401
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:44,290
Damn! That is a negative impact.
I repeat, that is a negative impact.

402
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,834
- Negative impact, sir.
- "Negative impact"?

403
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,462
That's the damn
Chrysler Building we're talking about.

404
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:53,007
- You told me he had it locked on.
- Echo 1, we had you locked on.

405
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:56,510
The heat-seekers can't lock. He's
colder than the buildings around him.

406
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:02,975
Freddie. Freddie! Freddie!

407
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:06,020
- What? What?
- Let's go before we get caught.

408
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:08,105
Jimmy. You know
that bad feeling I get...

409
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:10,316
...when something really bad
is gonna happen?

410
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:12,485
I'm getting that feeling
right now, man.

411
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:25,164
- Descend to 300 feet. Lasers on.
- Target, 11 o'clock.

412
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:55,861
Where'd he go?

413
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:07,331
Echo flight, get it together, guys.
Prepare to fire.

414
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:10,751
- Echo 4, ready.
- Echo 2, ready.

415
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,045
Fire!

416
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:32,982
I think we got him.

417
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,788
We've lost Echo 1 and 2, sir.

418
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,583
Echo 4, where is target?

419
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:57,590
Jesus! He's right on my tail, sir.

420
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,262
I don't think I can shake him.

421
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:15,941
I think I lost him.

422
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:25,159
We've... We've lost Echo 4, sir.

423
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,996
What's the matter with you people?

424
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:32,208
You've caused more damage
than that goddamn thing did!

425
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:35,920
- Calm down. Have some candy.
- I don't want any. Leave me alone!

426
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:03,781
I can't believe it. I mean...

427
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:09,536
He did all of this,
and we did nothing to him.

428
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:13,457
That's not true. We fed him.

429
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,713
Here at the command center
in New Jersey...

430
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,882
...there is no new information
to report.

431
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:27,388
The military has clamped a media
blackout on whatever is going on.

432
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,348
Officials are not saying anything...

433
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:33,978
...about their attempts to contain or
control this creature, and now I see...

434
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:37,273
No, the situation is under control.

435
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,859
It's under control,
we have containment.

436
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,877
- Can I help you, young man?
- Yes.

437
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:01,588
Do you have any
at-home pregnancy tests?

438
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:04,675
Especially ones that look for
gonadotropic hormones...

439
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,927
...or clomiphene citrate?

440
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,721
I don't know. This...

441
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,597
This...

442
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:14,435
- This is all we've got.
- I'll take all of them.

443
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:17,855
Wow, you must have
quite some harem.

444
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:25,070
Audrey? Oh, my Go... Is that you?
What are you doing here?

445
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:27,156
Hi. Hello.

446
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:30,075
- Wow. How much is that?
- $46.

447
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:34,371
God, you look...
Wow! How have you been?

448
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,665
It's good to see you, Nick.

449
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:41,128
- So you made it.
- What?

450
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,589
You're a reporter, huh?

451
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:47,092
No, that's good. That's good.
That's what you always wanted.

452
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:51,221
I'm happy for you. Really, I am.

453
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:06,028
You're still mad at me?

454
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:10,866
Well, you left without a phone call,
a letter, nothing. All this time.

455
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:14,787
Yeah. Yeah, I guess
I am still a little mad.

456
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:19,958
That was eight years ago.
Some people change.

457
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:22,294
Most people don't.

458
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:28,133
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.

459
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,430
Audrey.

460
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:41,021
You're right.
Eight years is a long time.

461
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,065
Can I make you a cup of tea?

462
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:49,154
Sure, that'd be nice.

463
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:51,198
I still can't believe it.

464
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:53,617
How does a guy go
from anti-nuke activist...

465
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:56,829
...to working for the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission?

466
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:01,583
When you and I went
to rallies together in college...

467
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,128
...we helped to create awareness.

468
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:09,174
But now, from the inside,
I'm able to effect real change.

469
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:12,469
Exactly what changes
are you trying to effect?

470
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:15,222
I'm preparing a census
for the government.

471
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,308
I'm cataloging new species
that have been created...

472
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:20,561
...as a direct result
of nuclear contamination.

473
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,355
Is that what you think
created this thing?

474
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:26,650
Yeah. I found a blood sample
earlier this evening.

475
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:30,863
- How close did you get to the thing?
- I got pretty close.

476
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:38,036
- And what else did you find out?
- Well, we know he eats tons of fish.

477
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:42,875
He's amphibious.
He's a burrower. And...

478
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:51,049
...he's pregnant.

479
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,890
- He is?
- He's a very unusual he.

480
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:02,269
I mean, obviously these tests
weren't designed for this...

481
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:05,522
...but fundamentally they look for
the same hormonal patterns...

482
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:06,899
...to indicate pregnancy.

483
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:11,236
I don't get it. If he's the first of his
kind, how can he be pregnant?

484
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:12,779
Doesn't he need a mate?

485
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:14,948
Not if he reproduces asexually.

486
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:17,910
Where's the fun in that?

487
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:24,124
I kept thinking'
why would he travel so far?

488
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,084
But it makes perfect sense.

489
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:30,714
Lots of animals travel
great distances for reproduction.

490
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:35,135
That's what he's doing in New York.
He's nesting.

491
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:37,429
- Nesting?
- Yes.

492
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:42,601
Do you realize that a lizard can lay
up to 12 eggs at a time?

493
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:45,729
- Think of it.
- I didn't know that.

494
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:50,943
Forgive me, I have to get this to the
lab and see if I can confirm all this.

495
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:54,613
I'll be right back.

496
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:01,198
Come on, Joey'
there's nothing down here.

497
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:03,367
I'm telling you, man, I heard...

498
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:05,077
I heard something.

499
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:08,038
You heard nothing. It's a dead end.

500
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:19,132
Anything?

501
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:24,137
No. Nothing down here.

502
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,640
Nothing at all.

503
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:39,444
This is why, in this case, all the king's
horses and all the king's men...

504
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:42,155
...may not be able to put
the Big Apple together again.

505
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:43,907
Audrey Timmonds, WIDF News.

506
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,117
Yes!

507
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:46,785
- You owe me a beer.
- Like it?

508
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:48,745
- Yeah.
- I should've worn my hair back.

509
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:50,539
- No, it looks great.
- Good, good.

510
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:54,292
How did you get ahold of this?

511
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:59,297
Well, you know. It's like you said,
nice guys finish last.

512
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:01,967
- Thank you. I love you.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

513
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,427
What...?

514
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:13,645
Murray. Murray! Come here a second.

515
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,857
Hold on a second, all right?
What is it?

516
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:20,110
I've got exclusive footage of other
places this thing has attacked.

517
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,528
- You do?
- Yeah.

518
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:24,322
- Whose story is that?
- Mine.

519
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:38,003
There's a lot of movement
down there.

520
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,756
Military, police...

521
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:45,927
- It's my breakfast.
- I'm hungry.

522
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,262
Quiet!

523
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:49,681
If we can lure him into
a more open area...

524
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:53,727
...such as this portion of Central Park,
we should be able to take him down.

525
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:56,646
- Last time you didn't even scratch it.
- That's not true.

526
01:02:56,814 --> 01:02:58,648
My worm guy, I mean...

527
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:02,652
...Dr. Tatopoulos has found blood.
- Yes, I did.

528
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:06,114
See, the only thing we need to do
is get him out into open terrain...

529
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:09,284
...and use weapons that don't rely
on heat-seeking technology...

530
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:14,998
Excuse me, sir. I think the situation has
become more complicated than that.

531
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:20,212
The blood I collected revealed that the
creature is either about to lay eggs...

532
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:22,339
...or already has.

533
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:26,218
Are you trying to tell us that there's
another of those things out there?

534
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:28,845
No, no, governor, I don't believe so.

535
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:32,557
Wait a minute, wait.
Then how can it be pregnant?

536
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:35,018
What is this, the Virgin Lizard?

537
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:38,980
No, no, it reproduces asexually.

538
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:42,526
That's why we have to find the nest
as soon as possible.

539
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:44,694
Otherwise up to a dozen
will be born...

540
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:48,740
...each one capable of laying eggs
on its own.

541
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:51,743
Very quickly we could be
looking at an enormous population.

542
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:54,746
So after we kill the creature,
then we search for the nest.

543
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:57,040
No, I think it might be too late
by then.

544
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:59,543
These eggs are going
to hatch very quickly.

545
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:02,379
- How could you possibly know that?
- The fish.

546
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:05,423
The fish that we found
on the subway.

547
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:08,385
He's not collecting all this food
just for himself.

548
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:11,263
He's preparing to feed his young.

549
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:17,143
Do we have something on this guy?

550
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:23,233
Professor Nick Ta... Tat... Tato...

551
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:26,611
They call him "the worm guy."

552
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,410
Stay tuned for a special report.

553
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:36,121
Excuse us, please. Where you been?

554
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:38,790
- Your spot is up right after this.
- Oh, good.

555
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:44,254
- Could you turn it up, please?
- Can you turn it up, please? The TV?

556
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:48,466
If Dr. Tatopoulos is right, we have to act
quickly, before this problem escalates.

557
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:51,803
You want to divide our efferts based
solely on some wild theory?

558
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:54,806
Sir, Nick's come through
for us before, and if he feels...

559
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:57,642
Come through for you?
Your campaign's a disaster.

560
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:00,770
You weren't even able to
keep this thing out of Manhattan.

561
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:04,482
Excuse me, gentlemen,
but I think we should see this.

562
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:09,029
- Methods and motivations of
Manhattan's newest unwanted pest.

563
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,826
"Godzilla."

564
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:19,289
That's what Japanese sailors called him
in song, a mythological sea dragon...

565
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,333
...who filled their hearts with fear.

566
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:24,169
- Oh, my God! He stole my report!
- Yeah, I know.

567
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:26,880
That myth has become reality,
our modern-day terror.

568
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:29,716
- I don't believe it!
- Who is this Godzilla?

569
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:33,011
Where did he come from?
Why is he here?

570
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:36,556
And it's "Gojira, you moron!

571
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:40,477
A direct path can be traced from
Manhattan to French Polynesia...

572
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:43,355
...where nuclear tests have been
going on for two decades.

573
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:47,609
Researcher Dr. Tapadopoulos believes
the creature may be nesting...

574
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,904
...using Manhattan as ground zero
to cultivate the species.

575
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:54,407
This, despite the fact that the
combined might of the U.S. Military...

576
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,201
...has been unable to subdue...

577
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:58,745
- You went to the press with this?
- No.

578
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:02,040
- No, I haven't talked to anyone.
- They mentioned you by name!

579
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,500
Yeah. Yeah.

580
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:07,420
- You gave them the tape?
- No, I didn't give them the tape.

581
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:10,423
No, it's in my tent right now.

582
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:12,384
Oh, my God.

583
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:14,886
Oh, my God, she took it.

584
01:06:17,598 --> 01:06:22,102
Pack your stuff, mister. You're
officially off this project, as of now.

585
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:35,615
What's going on?

586
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:40,453
We're leaving.

587
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,796
I'm so sorry about all this.

588
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:58,096
Make sure that Hicks finds that nest
before it's too late.

589
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:00,765
I'll try.

590
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:14,279
What do you mean, he's not there?

591
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:16,781
A second ago you said
he was on the other line.

592
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:20,493
Please, it's urgent. I really need to
talk to him. Yes. Nick Tatopoulos.

593
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:37,343
You're leaving? Why?

594
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:41,473
Is it because of me?
Because of the story?

595
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:46,770
- What did you think would happen?
- You never said it was off the record.

596
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:51,316
I shouldn't have to, Audrey.
You were supposed to be my friend.

597
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:53,109
I trusted you.

598
01:07:57,490 --> 01:08:00,200
Nick, there's something
I have to tell you.

599
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:05,205
Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter.

600
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:15,215
When we broke up and I first came out
to New York, I was so sure I'd make it.

601
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:17,008
But I haven't.

602
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:21,387
That's why
I needed the story so bad.

603
01:08:21,555 --> 01:08:24,224
I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.

604
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:33,566
And you thought that made it okay
to steal my tapes?

605
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:37,987
No. It was a terrible thing to do.
I never should've have done that.

606
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:49,082
Good luck with your new career.
I really think you have what it takes.

607
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,209
Newark Airport.

608
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:02,762
I'm sorry.

609
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:09,394
Hey, yo! Come on, give her a break,
will you?

610
01:09:38,632 --> 01:09:41,634
Excuse me, is this the best way
to the airport?

611
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:51,769
Sir, where are you going?
Hey, hello!

612
01:09:55,107 --> 01:09:58,776
Okay, stop. Stop the car, right now.

613
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:01,654
Now let me out of here.

614
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:06,534
I'm afraid I can't do that.

615
01:10:09,246 --> 01:10:10,955
Hey, I know you, don't I?

616
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,128
- Yeah. You're that insurance guy.
- Agent Philippe Roaché.

617
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:23,468
Sounds big.

618
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:27,555
French Secret Service.

619
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:32,977
I thought you'd like to know
that your American friends...

620
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:36,189
...have decided not to look
for the creature's nest.

621
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:39,317
What? Are you sure?
How do you know that?

622
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:42,403
- We know. Trust me.
- Trust you?

623
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:45,490
You hijack me
and you expect me to trust you?

624
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:48,034
- Yes.
- And why should I do that?

625
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:54,499
Because you are the only one who
wants to find the nest as much as I do.

626
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:23,528
How did you get all this stuff
into the country?

627
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:26,281
This is America.
You can buy anything.

628
01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:28,533
But why all the secrecy?

629
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:31,077
Why aren't you guys
working with the U.S. Military?

630
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:34,330
I'm not permitted
to speak of such things.

631
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:39,043
Hey, you said you needed my trust.
Well, then I need yours.

632
01:11:41,755 --> 01:11:45,091
I am a patriot. I love my country.
You understand that?

633
01:11:45,342 --> 01:11:46,592
Sure.

634
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,803
It's my job to protect my country.

635
01:11:49,179 --> 01:11:53,641
Sometimes I must even protect it from
itself. From mistakes we've made.

636
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:56,686
Mistakes that we don't want
the world to know about.

637
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:59,939
- The nuclear tests in the Pacific?
- Yes.

638
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:03,401
This testing done by my country
left a terrible mess.

639
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:05,987
We're here to clean it up.

640
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:19,751
They are setting the next fish trap
at 8-something.

641
01:12:20,377 --> 01:12:25,590
We know how to get into the city'
we just don't know where to look.

642
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:36,309
Here. This is the 23rd Street
subway station.

643
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:40,271
That's where we first found the fish.
That'd a good place to start looking.

644
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:42,106
So you're in?

645
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:47,487
Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.

646
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:53,868
I always wanted to join
the French Foreign Legion.

647
01:13:04,838 --> 01:13:06,964
- Hello.
- How's it going?

648
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:18,017
Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.

649
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:20,645
- Honey.
- Hi, sweetie.

650
01:13:21,146 --> 01:13:23,189
- Who the hell are all these people?
- What?

651
01:13:23,357 --> 01:13:26,401
I couldn't just let them
sleep on the street.

652
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:32,198
- Where's Audrey?
- In the bedroom.

653
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:35,159
- Crying her eyes out because of you.
- Me?

654
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:36,661
What did I do?

655
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:39,497
All that "You gotta be vicious" stuff
you filled her head with.

656
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:42,667
- Get out of here!
- Go in there and talk to her right now.

657
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:45,044
Is it being with you?
Excuse me.

658
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:47,255
Contrary to some frivolous reporting...

659
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:51,676
...we have absolutely no information
whatsoever to make us believe...

660
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:54,804
...that there are any eggs
of the creature in the city.

661
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:59,559
There's no need for panic.
Repeat, there's no reason to panic.

662
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:03,771
It's all my fault.

663
01:14:04,648 --> 01:14:08,192
What have I done, Animal?
What have I become?

664
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:12,071
Look at me. This isn't me.
I don't do stuff like this.

665
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,615
You made a mistake. All right?
It happens.

666
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:16,868
Yeah, well...

667
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:21,038
...I just totally screwed up with the
only man who will ever care about me.

668
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:23,875
If I told you you could
make it all up to him, would you?

669
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:25,543
Of course I would.

670
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:31,382
Get this. After he left you in the street,
I kind of followed him.

671
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:34,093
I figured I'd talk some sense
into the guy.

672
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:36,596
Next thing I know,
he pulls into this warehouse...

673
01:14:36,763 --> 01:14:39,891
...with all these French wackos
in military outfits.

674
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:42,727
They wanna try to sneak
back into the city tonight.

675
01:14:43,604 --> 01:14:45,605
They're going after the nest.

676
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:49,484
If he finds it, I think you should be
the one to let the whole world know...

677
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:51,194
...that he was right all along.

678
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:54,280
You want me to follow him
into the city?

679
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:57,450
Yeah, we both will.

680
01:14:57,618 --> 01:15:02,997
- Come on, it'll be fun, it'll be fun.
- I already made a mess of everything.

681
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:04,999
Yeah, you really did, Audrey.

682
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:08,586
Listen, I'm going after him.
You can go with me, or not. Okay?

683
01:15:12,424 --> 01:15:17,762
- What are you doing?
- Can't let Lucy know. She'll hurt me.

684
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:37,823
What's with the chewing gum?

685
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:41,244
It makes us look more American.

686
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:42,995
Oh, really?

687
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:49,460
Just let me do all the talking.
All right?

688
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:55,633
It's not in gear.

689
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:07,687
Follow me. This way.

690
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:13,859
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

691
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,495
Come on.

692
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:26,163
What is this place?

693
01:16:26,331 --> 01:16:29,375
It's a vent that leads down
to the subway tunnels underneath.

694
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:32,837
It should take us right to
the 23rd Street station in Manhattan.

695
01:16:35,173 --> 01:16:39,010
You gotta be kidding me.
Aren't there rats and stuff down here?

696
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:45,349
I'm more concerned about lizards.
Big, ugly, nasty, large lizards.

697
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:04,994
Who are you boys with?

698
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:10,708
- We're with the 3-2, sir.
- I didn't ask you, soldier.

699
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:13,836
Well, Sergeant O'Neal
just called down for us.

700
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:16,589
He wants us to join him right now.
Sir. Thank you.

701
01:17:19,718 --> 01:17:23,471
- Have you got a problem talking?
- Why, no, sir. I'm fine.

702
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:26,724
Come on, let's go!

703
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:31,687
- All right. Keep it moving.
- Thank you very much.

704
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:41,572
Elvis Presley movies.
He was the king.

705
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:50,748
- Sir, O'Neal on the line.
- O'Neal, do you read me?

706
01:17:54,044 --> 01:17:57,588
- O'Neal.
- How are we doing?

707
01:17:57,756 --> 01:18:01,592
So far, so good.
We're right on schedule.

708
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:06,347
We're good.
We're... We're good.

709
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:23,406
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah.

710
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:26,450
There they are. Kill your light.
Kill your light.

711
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:31,455
Come on, how do we get down there?
We're gonna lose them.

712
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:43,426
- How did they get down there?
- I don't know.

713
01:18:45,345 --> 01:18:47,805
You don't think
they climbed down this thing?

714
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:49,473
Oh, Jesus!

715
01:19:06,199 --> 01:19:08,075
Careful.

716
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:15,875
- Give me your hand.
- I got you.

717
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:30,306
- Do you hear that?
- What?

718
01:20:13,433 --> 01:20:15,434
Animal, come on!

719
01:20:55,767 --> 01:20:58,185
I guess we go this way.

720
01:21:16,663 --> 01:21:20,583
We've spotted him in section five.

721
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:23,752
Combat positions. Here we go!

722
01:21:28,466 --> 01:21:31,468
Target's heading north
to section five.

723
01:21:31,636 --> 01:21:36,974
Do not fire until he has cleared
the buildings and enters the park!

724
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:05,312
Wait until he enters the park.

725
01:23:20,578 --> 01:23:22,204
Come on.

726
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:31,714
He's leaving! Damn it! Fire!
Fire at will!

727
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:40,514
Damn!

728
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:53,652
Fire!

729
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:00,617
Fly to evasive maneuvers.

730
01:24:08,585 --> 01:24:11,962
The target is in the clear and headed
towards the West Side Highway.

731
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:33,442
Don't worry. The Navy has a little
something there waiting for him.

732
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:44,703
- All stations manned for battle.
- At ordered depth, sir.

733
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:46,789
We have him on sonar.
Utah closing in.

734
01:24:46,956 --> 01:24:48,832
Make final preparations,
prepare to fire.

735
01:24:57,509 --> 01:25:01,011
- Aye, aye, manned and ready.
- Torpedo room manned and ready.

736
01:25:01,179 --> 01:25:03,472
- Final bearing and shoot.
- Are we locked on?

737
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:09,353
- Are we locked on? Locked on, captain.
- Number one, stand by.

738
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:12,940
- Fire.
- Torpedo one left the tube.

739
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:27,538
Indiana and Anchorage closing in.

740
01:25:27,705 --> 01:25:31,208
- Ensign, what's the status?
- We are locked on and closing in, sir.

741
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:32,835
Fire number one.

742
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:57,526
- Sir! The target's heading right at us!
- All back full!

743
01:25:57,694 --> 01:26:00,237
Aye, aye, sir. All back full.

744
01:26:07,745 --> 01:26:10,706
Stand by for impact. In 10 seconds.

745
01:26:15,378 --> 01:26:18,964
Six, five, four...

746
01:26:19,132 --> 01:26:22,092
...three, two, one.

747
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:44,031
We've lost the Anchorage, sir.

748
01:26:53,666 --> 01:26:54,958
He's shifted course, sir.

749
01:26:55,126 --> 01:26:58,503
- He's headed back towards Manhattan.
- Full ahead. Close in, lock on.

750
01:26:58,671 --> 01:27:01,840
- Prepare tubes three and four, lock on.
- Aye, aye, sir.

751
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:12,935
- Stand by, three. Fire.
- Torpedo three cleared and left the tube.

752
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:22,861
Impact in eight seconds.
Seven, six...

753
01:27:28,785 --> 01:27:31,995
Three, two, one.

754
01:27:39,045 --> 01:27:41,505
- Direct hit!
- Got him.

755
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:45,676
- Congratulations, sir.
- Good job.

756
01:27:46,803 --> 01:27:48,845
Yeah, well done.

757
01:28:29,387 --> 01:28:31,555
What's up there?

758
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:56,913
This is a good smell.

759
01:28:59,917 --> 01:29:03,795
Audrey, look at this.
He trashed the Garden.

760
01:29:04,297 --> 01:29:07,883
Oh, man! Now I'm pissed.

761
01:29:09,802 --> 01:29:12,512
- Is that them?
- Yeah.

762
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:52,135
Three eggs.
I thought there'd be more.

763
01:29:52,303 --> 01:29:54,388
And you were right.

764
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:07,984
Oh, my.

765
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:13,031
There's gotta be
more than 20 eggs here.

766
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:15,534
Way more.

767
01:30:35,012 --> 01:30:37,222
Start counting.

768
01:30:49,902 --> 01:30:52,571
- Could you help me?
- Yeah, you all right?

769
01:30:55,366 --> 01:30:57,033
There.

770
01:31:20,558 --> 01:31:22,225
We don't have enough explosives.

771
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:32,819
What the hell are they doing?

772
01:32:07,647 --> 01:32:10,732
Nick, we have a problem.

773
01:32:47,019 --> 01:32:49,729
Oh, my God. My God!

774
01:32:49,897 --> 01:32:51,773
Come on. Let's go!

775
01:32:52,108 --> 01:32:55,652
One second, all right?
One second. This is unbelievable.

776
01:33:09,292 --> 01:33:11,459
Don't you think
we have enough already?

777
01:33:11,627 --> 01:33:13,169
I just want...

778
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:21,177
Yeah, that's good for me.
That's plenty.

779
01:33:24,807 --> 01:33:26,808
We should...

780
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:35,859
Just let's not...

781
01:33:36,235 --> 01:33:38,069
...startle it.

782
01:33:47,079 --> 01:33:49,372
We smell like the fish.

783
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:52,542
- I think we should leave now.
- I think that's a good idea.

784
01:34:19,862 --> 01:34:21,321
Come on!

785
01:34:28,162 --> 01:34:31,539
- Everybody outside! Now!
- Come on. Let's go.

786
01:34:47,598 --> 01:34:53,520
Lock the doors now! We have to keep
them contained inside. Let's go!

787
01:35:54,457 --> 01:35:57,375
- You see that?
- All right. On three.

788
01:35:58,002 --> 01:35:59,043
Three!

789
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:13,892
This is where the Knicks
get showered and everything.

790
01:36:20,524 --> 01:36:23,401
Great. Now what do we do?

791
01:36:25,362 --> 01:36:28,823
I'm standing just outside the Jersey
entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel.

792
01:36:28,991 --> 01:36:33,703
Thousands of angry refugees are
demanding to be let back into the city.

793
01:36:33,871 --> 01:36:36,956
All major arteries into the city
are clogged with Manhattanites...

794
01:36:37,124 --> 01:36:38,875
...who are jubilant that Godzilla...

795
01:36:39,043 --> 01:36:40,919
Yes, yes, I understand.

796
01:36:41,086 --> 01:36:44,506
- Your office is swamped with calls.
- I know, I know!

797
01:36:44,673 --> 01:36:46,883
Do you have any idea
what's going on out there?

798
01:36:47,051 --> 01:36:50,386
Phones are ringing off the hook.
People are screaming to be let back in.

799
01:36:50,554 --> 01:36:52,722
We're sending divers into the river
for the body.

800
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:54,766
That thing's dead.
What are you waiting for?

801
01:36:54,934 --> 01:36:58,436
Colonel. Colonel, we've gotta
start a search for the nest.

802
01:36:58,646 --> 01:37:00,355
We've been through this already.

803
01:37:00,523 --> 01:37:03,066
What if Nick is right,
and we blow this whole thing?

804
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:06,194
This could be the only chance
we have to do something about it.

805
01:37:10,032 --> 01:37:12,075
Captain, organize a search party.

806
01:37:12,243 --> 01:37:15,286
I want a complete sweep of
the entire city and the subway.

807
01:37:15,454 --> 01:37:17,580
You don't have
the authority to do that.

808
01:37:17,873 --> 01:37:19,791
Try and stop me.

809
01:37:32,304 --> 01:37:36,891
Contact the military. Get them to send
a bomber to blow up this building.

810
01:37:37,059 --> 01:37:41,312
- How do I do that?
- 555-7600.

811
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:44,899
Tell them it's a Code Dragonfly.
That should get you through.

812
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:49,821
- What are you waiting for?
- 555 what?

813
01:37:49,989 --> 01:37:54,742
- 7600.
- 7600.

814
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:01,457
- All circuits are busy right now.
- It's busy.

815
01:38:01,625 --> 01:38:02,750
Try again.

816
01:38:13,512 --> 01:38:14,846
What did they say?

817
01:38:16,181 --> 01:38:18,975
I can't get through.
I don't know what's wrong.

818
01:38:21,645 --> 01:38:23,563
We secured the doors
on the upper levels.

819
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:25,940
Where are Jean-Philippe
and Jean-Pierre?

820
01:38:26,108 --> 01:38:27,317
They didn't make it.

821
01:38:29,987 --> 01:38:34,741
Nick, my men and I will hold them here.
You'll have to go and get help.

822
01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:55,929
You think we could fit up in there?

823
01:38:58,349 --> 01:39:00,975
There's one way to find out.

824
01:39:01,685 --> 01:39:05,021
Boost me up. Boost me up.

825
01:41:15,944 --> 01:41:20,073
This is not good.
This is not good.

826
01:41:32,169 --> 01:41:33,169
Come on, come on.

827
01:41:38,008 --> 01:41:39,842
Come on.

828
01:42:08,872 --> 01:42:10,456
Wrong floor.

829
01:42:19,383 --> 01:42:21,717
Why don't we go this way?

830
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:46,742
- It's me. It's me.
- What happened?

831
01:42:46,910 --> 01:42:49,912
They're loose. They're all over
the place. I couldn't get out.

832
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:51,706
No one can get out.

833
01:42:55,752 --> 01:42:59,172
- Who the hell are you?
- Audrey?

834
01:43:01,091 --> 01:43:02,884
Here.

835
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:07,430
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

836
01:43:07,598 --> 01:43:09,682
- No cameras.
- Are you kid...?

837
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:11,851
Yeah, all right. Very good.

838
01:43:12,102 --> 01:43:16,397
Do you have a radio or walkie-talkie?
Anything to contact the outside?

839
01:43:16,607 --> 01:43:20,026
- What about the phones?
- The circuits are all jammed.

840
01:43:20,527 --> 01:43:24,447
Wait. I know how we can get
a message to the outside.

841
01:43:33,081 --> 01:43:34,373
This way. Come on.

842
01:43:37,836 --> 01:43:40,213
The tape. The tape!

843
01:43:46,803 --> 01:43:47,929
Come on!

844
01:44:02,361 --> 01:44:03,986
Come on. Come on.

845
01:44:04,154 --> 01:44:07,156
- The broadcast booth is over here.
- How do you know that?

846
01:44:07,324 --> 01:44:10,159
Our network covers
the Ranger games.

847
01:44:12,246 --> 01:44:14,413
- It's locked.
- There's a code. There's a code.

848
01:44:16,166 --> 01:44:17,500
Come on. Come on!

849
01:44:22,756 --> 01:44:24,465
I was just about to get it.

850
01:44:24,633 --> 01:44:28,427
The network's on an intranet. It's a
direct feed to our computer system.

851
01:44:28,637 --> 01:44:32,014
Your station won't have any easier
time reaching the military than I did.

852
01:44:32,182 --> 01:44:35,184
When you worked with them,
did they monitor all news broadcasts?

853
01:44:35,394 --> 01:44:37,186
Yeah. Yeah, they did.

854
01:44:37,354 --> 01:44:41,399
All right, we'll go live. Audrey'
we'll broadcast right from in here.

855
01:44:41,566 --> 01:44:46,320
- Hopefully they'll see it.
- I'll try to get a message through.

856
01:44:58,375 --> 01:45:00,793
Let's not forget in our rush
to return to the city...

857
01:45:00,961 --> 01:45:03,587
...that many people have had
their lives changed forever.

858
01:45:04,172 --> 01:45:07,133
No one in the city has been
untouched by the frenzy...

859
01:45:07,301 --> 01:45:11,178
The sick, the displaced,
the injured all need our help...

860
01:45:15,809 --> 01:45:18,060
There's no Ranger game on tonight.

861
01:45:21,565 --> 01:45:26,235
Ed, if you're seeing this, will you
please put us on live? It's urgent!

862
01:45:26,903 --> 01:45:29,613
I know this sounds crazy,
Ed, but you have to do it.

863
01:45:31,908 --> 01:45:35,953
- Please, just trust me.
- I'm not putting you on live.

864
01:45:36,121 --> 01:45:38,998
- I don't think he's gonna do it.
- Yes, he will.

865
01:45:39,875 --> 01:45:42,376
All right, Ed? Come on.

866
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:49,467
See that, Ed? They're gonna be
all over the city if we don't stop them.

867
01:45:50,844 --> 01:45:52,428
Give me a second, will you?

868
01:45:58,268 --> 01:46:02,188
- Finally it's time to return home.
- Get the diving boats ready.

869
01:46:03,273 --> 01:46:05,316
Our fears have been allayed...

870
01:46:05,484 --> 01:46:08,778
...thanks to the heroic efforts
of our boys in uniform.

871
01:46:09,446 --> 01:46:10,613
Are we on?

872
01:46:13,367 --> 01:46:15,242
- Yeah, good, you're on.
- Are we live?

873
01:46:15,410 --> 01:46:17,370
Yes, yes. You're on. Go!

874
01:46:18,121 --> 01:46:20,289
We're live inside
Madison Square Garden...

875
01:46:20,457 --> 01:46:23,876
...where Niko Dr. Tatopoulos has
discovered the beast's lair.

876
01:46:24,044 --> 01:46:26,545
Doctor, can you please tell us
what's happening here?

877
01:46:28,965 --> 01:46:31,634
- That's you. Yes, go, go.
- Thank you.

878
01:46:31,802 --> 01:46:35,721
Yeah, well, we've discovered
over 200 eggs...

879
01:46:35,889 --> 01:46:37,681
Go get Hicks. Get Hicks!

880
01:46:37,849 --> 01:46:40,643
...which, a few moments ago,
began hatching.

881
01:46:41,728 --> 01:46:45,689
The creatures, though just hatched,
are over 9 feet tall...

882
01:46:45,857 --> 01:46:48,150
...and they've begun feeding.

883
01:46:49,986 --> 01:46:52,405
When their food supply
runs out here...

884
01:46:52,572 --> 01:46:56,992
...they will attempt to hunt down food
of their own outside of this nest.

885
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:58,994
Oh, my God.

886
01:46:59,162 --> 01:47:03,332
If they get out, they'll multiply, and
very soon a new species will emerge.

887
01:47:04,709 --> 01:47:08,337
One that could replace us as
the dominant species of this planet.

888
01:47:08,505 --> 01:47:13,092
Each one of these amazing reptiles
are born pregnant.

889
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:19,598
Adaptive and cunning, these 200
could become 40,000 within this year.

890
01:47:19,766 --> 01:47:22,143
If the military is listening
to this broadcast...

891
01:47:22,310 --> 01:47:24,979
...they have to destroy
this building immediately...

892
01:47:25,147 --> 01:47:26,981
...before these creatures
can escape.

893
01:47:33,321 --> 01:47:35,990
So far, they're all trapped
inside this building...

894
01:47:36,158 --> 01:47:38,868
...but I don't think we can
contain them for long.

895
01:47:39,035 --> 01:47:44,373
They're very strong, they're agile,
and they're looking for food.

896
01:47:44,541 --> 01:47:46,876
So I guess your theory
of the creature nesting...

897
01:47:47,043 --> 01:47:49,253
...turned out to be correct after all.

898
01:47:51,339 --> 01:47:54,884
Regardless of what happens to us,
the most important thing...

899
01:47:55,051 --> 01:47:57,428
...is that this building
be destroyed immediately...

900
01:47:57,596 --> 01:47:59,305
...before they can escape
into the city.

901
01:47:59,473 --> 01:48:01,724
Reporting live from
Madison Square Garden...

902
01:48:01,892 --> 01:48:05,060
...this is Audrey Timmonds'
for WIDF News.

903
01:48:10,609 --> 01:48:12,318
Thanks, Audrey.

904
01:48:13,487 --> 01:48:14,904
Sure.

905
01:48:24,831 --> 01:48:27,082
That's affirmative.
Let me spell it out for you.

906
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:30,252
I want you to blow up
Madison Square Garden.

907
01:48:38,136 --> 01:48:40,304
Well, the good news
is they got that message.

908
01:48:40,472 --> 01:48:44,558
The bad news is we've got less than
six minutes to get out of the building.

909
01:48:44,726 --> 01:48:47,645
Okay, the party's over.
Time to leave.

910
01:49:02,661 --> 01:49:05,496
Anyone care to join me?

911
01:49:08,250 --> 01:49:11,669
- Where did you find this guy?
- He's from France.

912
01:49:15,298 --> 01:49:17,508
Stallion 1-5 is inbound.

913
01:49:23,974 --> 01:49:25,057
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

914
01:49:26,685 --> 01:49:29,144
Guys, this way. Come on.

915
01:49:30,021 --> 01:49:31,772
Oh, my God. The fish!

916
01:49:32,649 --> 01:49:34,525
Nick, come on!

917
01:49:34,693 --> 01:49:37,069
They've eaten all the fish.

918
01:49:46,037 --> 01:49:47,871
Come on, Nick, this way.

919
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:53,419
Not this way, back that way!

920
01:50:05,015 --> 01:50:07,433
- The escalators!
- Hurry!

921
01:50:27,370 --> 01:50:30,956
Stallions, check master arms on.
Two, three.

922
01:50:41,259 --> 01:50:42,968
I think I lost them.

923
01:51:02,989 --> 01:51:07,534
Stallion 1-5 showing a good laser track
on top of the Garden. Selecting LGB.

924
01:51:07,952 --> 01:51:09,870
How much time do we have left?

925
01:51:10,914 --> 01:51:13,666
- Less than 30 seconds.
- Oh, God!

926
01:51:24,010 --> 01:51:25,886
Let's go!

927
01:51:38,024 --> 01:51:40,150
Let's go, come on!

928
01:51:52,997 --> 01:51:54,707
Come on! Come on!

929
01:51:59,963 --> 01:52:01,255
Send your Mavericks.

930
01:52:03,299 --> 01:52:04,925
Two away.

931
01:52:22,193 --> 01:52:24,611
Lead has good hits.

932
01:52:41,713 --> 01:52:45,382
- You all right?
- Yeah.

933
01:52:46,593 --> 01:52:49,970
Somehow I never thought
your life was this exciting.

934
01:52:50,138 --> 01:52:52,097
You'd be surprised.

935
01:52:53,808 --> 01:52:56,185
I'd like to find out.

936
01:53:09,032 --> 01:53:13,619
- How are you doing? You all right?
- I could use a coffee.

937
01:54:11,052 --> 01:54:12,386
He looks angry.

938
01:54:16,307 --> 01:54:19,852
- What do we do?
- Running would be a good idea.

939
01:54:20,687 --> 01:54:22,938
Let's go!

940
01:54:46,004 --> 01:54:47,546
Come on. Come on!

941
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:02,352
- Get in, get in.
- What are you doing?

942
01:55:40,350 --> 01:55:42,100
You better step on it, Mr. French.

943
01:55:51,694 --> 01:55:54,071
Take 57th across town
and cut up the West Side.

944
01:55:54,238 --> 01:55:56,073
No, are you crazy? Take the FDR.

945
01:55:57,367 --> 01:55:59,952
- Please! The FDR, in the rain?
- There ought to be a map.

946
01:56:01,704 --> 01:56:03,664
It's getting larger.

947
01:56:13,591 --> 01:56:15,175
Take the Westside Highway.

948
01:56:17,428 --> 01:56:20,138
- I got one.
- No, the West Side's got construction.

949
01:56:20,306 --> 01:56:21,807
This is a subway map!

950
01:56:24,352 --> 01:56:25,894
- Broadway?
- No, no.

951
01:56:26,729 --> 01:56:28,438
Make up your minds!

952
01:56:36,823 --> 01:56:38,907
Broadway! Take Broadway!

953
01:56:39,075 --> 01:56:43,120
Affirmative.
We're traveling down Broadway and...

954
01:56:43,287 --> 01:56:45,706
...make a right on 34th Street.

955
01:57:01,305 --> 01:57:04,433
- That was O'Neal!
- Everybody okay? Everybody all right?

956
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:06,059
- Turn around. Do it!
- What?

957
01:57:06,227 --> 01:57:07,477
- No.
- What? Why?

958
01:57:21,451 --> 01:57:24,453
Command Center, come in.
Command, this is O'Neal...

959
01:57:31,085 --> 01:57:32,461
O'Neal!

960
01:57:46,517 --> 01:57:50,020
- O'Neal, what's going on?
- He's back, sir. He's back.

961
01:57:50,188 --> 01:57:52,981
Godzilla is still alive.

962
01:57:54,275 --> 01:57:57,152
Lieutenant Rodgers, are those
F-18's still in the air?

963
01:57:57,320 --> 01:58:01,031
- Yes, sir. They're heading back to base.
- Turn them around.

964
01:58:32,355 --> 01:58:35,232
- Here it is. Here it is.
- Sir, what are we looking for?

965
01:58:35,441 --> 01:58:41,655
Every cab company keeps a record
of each of its cabs, radio frequencies.

966
01:58:45,827 --> 01:58:46,868
Bingo.

967
01:58:53,084 --> 01:58:54,376
He's getting closer.

968
01:58:57,964 --> 01:59:01,007
There, there! The tunnel!
Go in the tunnel.

969
01:59:07,598 --> 01:59:09,683
They've got it blocked off.

970
01:59:18,109 --> 01:59:21,653
- Now where would you like to go?
- Turn off the lights.

971
01:59:29,495 --> 01:59:31,580
Nick, are you there? Nick?

972
01:59:32,415 --> 01:59:34,124
O'Neal?

973
01:59:34,292 --> 01:59:36,001
Nice trick with the cab ID.

974
01:59:36,169 --> 01:59:38,712
- Where the hell are you?
- You have to help us.

975
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:40,130
We're in the...

976
01:59:40,298 --> 01:59:43,091
- Park Avenue Tunnel.
- Park Avenue Tunnel.

977
01:59:52,435 --> 01:59:54,811
He's got us trapped in here.
- Listen to me.

978
01:59:54,979 --> 01:59:57,480
You guys have got to
lure him out into the open.

979
01:59:57,648 --> 01:59:59,816
So we can get
a clear shot at him. Over.

980
01:59:59,984 --> 02:00:02,485
No problem. Want us to
wash him up for you too?

981
02:00:06,532 --> 02:00:08,325
Where's the nearest
suspension bridge?

982
02:00:08,576 --> 02:00:09,701
Brooklyn. Brooklyn.

983
02:00:11,829 --> 02:00:15,165
- Let's go.
- How would you like us to do that?

984
02:00:15,333 --> 02:00:17,500
Does this thing have high beams?

985
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:26,801
Now!

986
02:00:36,812 --> 02:00:38,813
Sir, he's headed toward
the Brooklyn Bridge.

987
02:00:38,981 --> 02:00:41,441
Target is heading
toward the Brooklyn Bridge.

988
02:00:41,609 --> 02:00:43,818
Direct the F-18's
to the Brooklyn Bridge.

989
02:00:50,868 --> 02:00:53,578
- He's not following us.
- Really?

990
02:01:14,392 --> 02:01:15,976
Oh, my God!

991
02:01:16,185 --> 02:01:18,728
You gotta be kidding me, man.
We're in his mouth!

992
02:01:18,896 --> 02:01:21,273
We're in his mouth!

993
02:01:25,653 --> 02:01:27,237
You're going the wrong way.

994
02:01:27,405 --> 02:01:29,698
- You're going the wrong way.
- Shut up!

995
02:01:47,842 --> 02:01:49,759
Okay, gun it! Gun it! Go, go, go!

996
02:02:04,734 --> 02:02:05,775
Go, go, go!

997
02:02:18,456 --> 02:02:20,415
Move it, move it, move it!

998
02:02:42,730 --> 02:02:44,981
O'Neal! O'Neal, it worked!

999
02:02:50,488 --> 02:02:52,197
He's caught
in the suspension cables.

1000
02:02:52,365 --> 02:02:54,407
- Do it! Now!
- Roger that.

1001
02:02:57,828 --> 02:03:00,789
Stallion 1-5, tally one on the bridge.

1002
02:03:02,124 --> 02:03:03,750
Lock on and fire at will.

1003
02:03:07,129 --> 02:03:08,421
Two away.

1004
02:03:39,537 --> 02:03:42,247
Direct hit, but the target
is still moving, sir.

1005
02:03:42,415 --> 02:03:44,541
Well, circle around and fire again!

1006
02:06:12,314 --> 02:06:16,192
That's my husband!
That's my husband!

1007
02:06:16,402 --> 02:06:19,696
Oh, my... I'm gonna kill him.

1008
02:06:26,537 --> 02:06:30,623
Oh, my. Oh, God. Oh, no.

1009
02:06:36,338 --> 02:06:39,632
Wait. We can use this.

1010
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:43,261
- "The mayor who destroyed Godzilla."
- I don't think we should exploit this.

1011
02:06:43,429 --> 02:06:45,388
- It could backfire.
- Listen to me, idiot.

1012
02:06:45,556 --> 02:06:48,891
I do the thinking here, you idiot.
It's a magnificent idea.

1013
02:06:49,059 --> 02:06:51,894
You know what I think about you
and your campaign?

1014
02:06:53,439 --> 02:06:55,398
Gene, where you going? I need you.

1015
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:57,984
O'Neal, do you read me?

1016
02:06:59,320 --> 02:07:01,279
Yes, sir.

1017
02:07:01,447 --> 02:07:03,948
That's one hell of a job, soldier.

1018
02:07:05,034 --> 02:07:07,577
That's one hell of a job.

1019
02:07:11,582 --> 02:07:13,833
Roger that, sir.

1020
02:07:15,878 --> 02:07:19,922
Sorry, folks, I've already promised
my story as an exclusive...

1021
02:07:20,090 --> 02:07:22,508
...to another reporter.

1022
02:07:22,676 --> 02:07:27,847
We did it! We got the exclusive!
Audrey, you're beautiful.

1023
02:07:28,015 --> 02:07:32,185
- We did? I don't think so.
- Remember, you work for me.

1024
02:07:32,353 --> 02:07:36,397
Not anymore, Chuck. I quit.

1025
02:07:38,233 --> 02:07:42,195
- But you...
- She quits.

1026
02:07:51,497 --> 02:07:53,706
Audrey. Audrey.

1027
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:56,250
Did you take the tape
from the camera?

1028
02:07:56,418 --> 02:07:57,585
No.

1029
02:07:57,753 --> 02:08:01,339
- I mean, I couldn't have just lost it.
- Where's Philippe?

1030
02:08:10,766 --> 02:08:12,934
Hello? Hello?

1031
02:08:13,102 --> 02:08:16,104
- It's Philippe.
- Where are you?

1032
02:08:16,271 --> 02:08:18,064
Tell you friend I'll send the tape...

1033
02:08:18,232 --> 02:08:20,483
...after I've removed
a few items from it.

1034
02:08:20,651 --> 02:08:24,153
- I understand.
- I just wanted to say au revoir.

1035
02:08:24,321 --> 02:08:27,949
Thank you for your help, my friend.

1036
02:08:29,535 --> 02:08:32,120
Well, wait... Hello?

1037
02:08:43,549 --> 02:08:45,883
Who was that French guy anyway?

1038
02:08:46,468 --> 02:08:48,845
Just some insurance guy.

1039
02:08:50,806 --> 02:08:53,641
Did he take my...?
Did he say anything about my tape?

1040
02:08:53,892 --> 02:08:56,102
Yeah, he said something
about your tape.

1041
02:08:56,270 --> 02:09:00,648
- Does he have my tape?
- Yeah, he has your tape.

1042
02:09:00,816 --> 02:09:03,151
You'll get it back.

1043
02:09:52,816 --> 02:09:54,151
The End

1044
02:09:54,816 --> 02:10:05,151
