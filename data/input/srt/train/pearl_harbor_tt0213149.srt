1
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,478
German bandits at two o'clock!

2
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:02,896
Increase throttle! Power dive!

3
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,445
Spell it right, Rafe.

4
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:13,991
"Rudder" is spelled with two Ds.

5
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:16,034
- Thanks, wingman.
- Yeah, sure.

6
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:18,579
Whoa, bandits!

7
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,207
Crack shootin', Danny.

8
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,417
Crack shootin', Rafe.

9
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,419
- Land of the free.
- Home of the brave.

10
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,482
Great flyin',Dad!

11
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,486
Come on.
I'm gonna teach you how to fly.

12
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,953
I get the front!

13
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:01,330
No, you take the back.

14
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,582
I'm bigger,
and I should be in front.

15
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,876
I'm older,
and I'm teachin', so no.

16
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,836
Wow.
It's like we're really flying.

17
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,254
Yeah, I did it lots of times.

18
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:10,756
Come on, you man the guns.

19
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,216
I'll give her some throttle.

20
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,259
We gotta get those
dirty German bandits.

21
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,225
Oh, gosh!

22
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,816
- Hang on!
- Make it stop, Rafe!

23
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,487
I've seen my dad
do this lots of times.

24
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,197
Don't worry!

25
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,617
Rafe!

26
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,913
Oh, my gosh! We're flying!

27
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,831
We're flying!

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,168
Whoa! Uhh!

29
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:01,139
Wow.

30
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:02,850
My dad's gonna kill me.

31
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,477
Come on.

32
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:08,188
Yes! Whoo-hoo!

33
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,398
We flew!

34
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,483
We flew! Yes!
I'm a pilot!

35
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,193
- I know!
- Yeah!

36
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,530
We flew.

37
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,323
- You no-account boy!
- Daddy-

38
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,075
I done told you,
you spend time playing...

39
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,327
with this stupid boy
can't read...

40
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,037
you ain't never goin'
to amount to nothin'!

41
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:26,748
He ain't stupid, Daddy!

42
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,041
Daddy!

43
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,043
Ohh!

44
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,461
Come on!

45
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,297
Uhh!

46
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,175
Get on back home. Now!

47
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,095
Get on up.

48
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:41,847
You got work to do.

49
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,516
Come on! Come on, get on home!

50
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,810
Uhh!

51
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,896
You let him alone!

52
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,024
Daddy, no!

53
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,443
I will bust you open,
you dirty German!

54
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,945
What'd you call me?

55
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,867
I fought the Germans in France.

56
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,913
And I fought 'em
in the trenches.

57
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,123
And I pray to God
no one ever has to see...

58
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:09,541
the things that I saw.

59
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,477
You're my bestfriend.

60
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:32,397
Daddy, wait!

61
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:36,109
Daddy, wait.

62
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,034
Adolf Hitler...

63
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,078
builds the German
military machine...

64
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,205
and drags
all of Europe into war.

65
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,624
But even while France
falls to Hitler...

66
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,418
America still refuses
to join the fighting.

67
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,814
- Where's McCawley and Walker?
- Still training, sir.

68
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,568
Alright, Danny.
Now let's show 'em how to fly.

69
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,027
We're gonna play chicken.
You ready?

70
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,363
This ain't the farm,
and these ain't no cropdusters.

71
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,573
I'm not playing
chicken with you.

72
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,116
Now don't be a baby.
I'll tell you what-

73
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,535
- I'm not doing it, Rafe.
- Well, I'm coming right at you.

74
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,287
You can turn, or you can hit me.
It's up to you.

75
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,416
What the-

76
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:33,667
Oh, boy.

77
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,298
Why you always
bustin' my ass, Rafe?

78
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,632
Which way you goin'?

79
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:45,345
I guess I'll go right.
No, uh, left. I'll go left.

80
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:48,932
OK, we're goin' left, right?

81
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,309
Ri-uh, right. Right?

82
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,394
Right like we're goin' right,
or right like we're goin' left?

83
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,021
Well, now you got me
all mixed up!

84
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,064
I don't know.
Make up your mind.

85
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,361
God, Rafe, we're going right!
Righty-tighty!

86
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,572
Aah!

87
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,619
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

88
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,081
Those are some smooth aces.

89
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,250
Did you say something?

90
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,544
'Cause let me tell ya,
those farm boys are grounded!

91
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,880
Yes, sir, an entirely
unacceptable use...

92
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,633
of m-m-military aircraft, sir.

93
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,552
- Get my hat.
- Yes, sir.

94
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:28,639
Get those hedge-hoppers
in Doolittle's office.

95
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,058
After two years of training...

96
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,435
you believe that
a $45,000 airplane...

97
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,978
is there for your amusement?

98
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,271
No, sir.
I was just trying...

99
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:37,606
to keep my edge, Major.

100
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,483
And when you did
the outside loop last week...

101
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,985
what did you think that was?
Honing your skills?

102
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,278
That's not training, McCawley.

103
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,571
That's a stunt.

104
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,907
And I personally
consider it to be reckless...

105
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,452
and irresponsible.

106
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:51,703
Major...

107
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,666
How could that be,
when you're famous...

108
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,417
for being the first man
in the world ever to do it?

109
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:58,585
Don't get cute with me, son.

110
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,129
No, sir, I don't mean
to be disrespectful.

111
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,924
I just think that-
well, I-

112
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,175
It is reckless
and irresponsible...

113
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,468
if you're just doing it
to be a show-off.

114
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:10,180
But I was doing it to try
to inspire the men, sir...

115
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,557
in the way that
you've inspired me.

116
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,725
I believe the French
even have a word for that...

117
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,602
when the men get together
to honor their leaders.

118
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:16,979
They call it an homage, sir.

119
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,897
- A what?
- An homage, sir.

120
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,607
That's bullshit, McCawley!

121
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:26,989
But it's very,
very good bullshit.

122
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,240
Thank you, sir.

123
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:34,705
McCawley, you remind me
of myself fifteen years ago.

124
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,748
Which is why we need
to discuss this.

125
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,792
Have a seat, son.

126
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,303
The British have accepted you
into the Eagle Squadron.

127
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,763
You're on your way
to England tomorrow...

128
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:53,932
if you still want to go.

129
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:56,476
Huh. Wow.

130
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,478
Just a few British pilots
are all that stand...

131
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,856
between Hitler
and total victory in Europe.

132
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,941
They're gonna need
all the help they can get.

133
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:04,401
Yes, sir.
Well, I'm on my way.

134
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,820
Just for the record...

135
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,739
I'm supposed to ask you
to reconsider.

136
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,324
Sir?

137
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,367
Sooner or later
we're gonna be in this war...

138
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,369
whether we like it or not.

139
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:16,747
And I'm gonna need
all of my best pilots.

140
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,625
So it's my duty
to ask you to stay.

141
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,836
Major, what would you do?

142
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:26,882
If it was me...

143
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:31,178
I'd go.

144
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,597
Get out. Am I going bald
right back here?

145
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,806
Ooh!

146
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,101
Man, I am one good-lookin'
son of a bitch.

147
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,770
Don't you ever die.

148
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,439
Die. That's exactly...

149
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:45,526
the concept
you gotta work tonight.

150
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:49,029
You put a drop of this clove oil
under your eyes...

151
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:51,073
and you let 'em sting
and well up.

152
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:54,493
You get your nurse alone,
take a breath...

153
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,912
let her see your eyes glisten...

154
00:08:56,995 --> 00:09:01,416
and say, "Baby,
they're training me for war...

155
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,378
"and I don't know
what'll happen...

156
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,673
"but if I die tomorrow,
I want to know...

157
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:11,718
"that we lived
all we could tonight. "

158
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,720
Come on, guys!
We got nurses waitin'.

159
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,557
Come on, before the rest
of his hair falls out.

160
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,102
How could you do this?

161
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,645
Well, Doolittle assigned me.

162
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,940
He wanted me to get some real-
real combat training in.

163
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,149
Well, guess what?

164
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,402
It's not training over there.
It's war.

165
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,696
Where the losers die,
and there aren't any winners-

166
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:31,905
just guys who turn
into broken-down wrecks...

167
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,115
like my father.

168
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,408
Yeah, I understand that, Danny.

169
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,742
But I feel like
I got a duty to go.

170
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:37,828
Don't preach to me
about duty, damn it.

171
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:39,746
I wear the same uniform you do.

172
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,583
Now, if trouble wants me,
I'm ready for it.

173
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:43,792
But why go looking for it?

174
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:45,919
God, Danny, come on.

175
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:48,380
I'm gonna be twenty-five.
I might as well be an old man.

176
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,465
They're gonna have me bein'
a flight instructor.

177
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,968
I don't wanna teach
loops and barrel rolls.

178
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,303
I wanna be a combat fighter.

179
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:55,512
Hey, come on!

180
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:58,724
The nurses can't
d- d-dance by themselves.

181
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,517
Let's go.

182
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:12,362
If the call of duty
means seeing 150 men...

183
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,906
in their underwear every day...

184
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,240
we are here to serve.

185
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:17,659
I can't believe it.

186
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:19,745
Saturday night
in New York City.

187
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,455
Do you know what they're doing
where I come from?

188
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:22,915
Nothing.

189
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:24,750
Cow-tipping.

190
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,001
Well, that's why
you joined the Navy, hon'.

191
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,295
To get out of that dusty
little town and see the world.

192
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:30,964
May I remind you, Barbara,
we're Navy nurses, not tourists.

193
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:33,800
I joined to do
my patriotic duty and...

194
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:36,053
to meet guys.

195
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,513
Me, too.

196
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:39,306
Girls, we're gonna have
so much fun tonight in the city.

197
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,849
You've gotta tell them
the story, Evelyn.

198
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,851
What?

199
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,061
Oh, come on. Tell us.

200
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:45,646
Oh, it's such a long story.

201
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:47,689
We got time.

202
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,566
I saw it happen.

203
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,818
Well, it was
about four weeks ago...

204
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:53,946
What do you think
is b-b-better?

205
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,365
All in the one cheek,
or spreading them out?

206
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:58,825
OK.

207
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,203
Fusco, Anthony.

208
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,835
You all right, buddy?

209
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,087
Sweetie, do you really
have to do this?

210
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,173
I'm not gonna get yellow fever
in my barracks.

211
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:16,260
No? If you'd rather,
she can do it.

212
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,183
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Just gimme a minute.

213
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:26,520
Honey, the government
says stick 'em, we stick 'em.

214
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:27,771
Uh!

215
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,192
Hey, Red, you alright?

216
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:37,990
Eye exam number four?

217
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:41,660
Listen, Doc, I have passed
a dozen medical checks.

218
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,912
You write that,
they won't let me fly.

219
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:46,456
Sorry, son.

220
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,916
I'm gonna fail.

221
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,543
They're gonna
take my wings away.

222
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,879
No, they won't. Just relax.

223
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:53,463
Read the bottom line, please.

224
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:54,882
Just keep practicin'
the bottom line.

225
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,717
And don't worry.
I'm right behind you.

226
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,553
J- L-M-K-P-O-

227
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:05,017
Next.

228
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,476
Ma'am.

229
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:12,524
J- L-M-K-P-O-E-T-X.

230
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:14,026
Eyes like an eagle, ma'am.

231
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,944
Slow down, flyboy.

232
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:18,739
And, instead of the bottom,
read the very top. Both eyes.

233
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,909
Yeah.

234
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:25,412
"C"- sorry, "J."

235
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,414
Ahem. "C"...

236
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:28,707
- "W."
- "W."

237
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,001
- "Q."
- Uh, "Q."

238
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,753
Uh, "'Q."'

239
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,508
Read the bottom line
again, please.

240
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:41,595
But read it right to left
and every other letter.

241
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,937
"E."

242
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,564
Heh. "'X."'

243
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:54,942
- X-E.
- X-E.

244
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:57,402
X- E, ma'am.

245
00:12:57,486 --> 00:13:00,072
Ma'am, I know how this looks.

246
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:01,782
I'm sorry, Lieutenant,
I really am.

247
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,951
But Army and Navy
requires 20/20 vision.

248
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:06,662
Oh, i-it's-it's not
a problem with my eyes.

249
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:07,955
I mean, I can see.

250
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,790
I mean, I can hit a running
rabbit with a $3.00 pistol.

251
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:11,375
I got a problem with letters,
that's all.

252
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,001
Well, maybe after
some schooling...

253
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:14,670
you could come back
and take the test again.

254
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:15,963
No, I had schooling.

255
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,339
I mean, I-the teachers
just never knew...

256
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,341
what to make of it.
It's just letters.

257
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:20,884
I mix 'em up sometimes.
That's all.

258
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:24,263
I mean, I just get 'em
backward sometimes.

259
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:27,766
L- look here. Uh, my-my math
and-and spacial reasoning...

260
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,184
and my verbal scores
are all excellent.

261
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:31,061
But you barely passed
the written exam.

262
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,272
Yeah, but he did pass it.
So, is it my turn now?

263
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:36,650
- No, you'll wait your turn.
- Yes, ma'am.

264
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:38,902
Ma'am, I-I'm never gonna
be an English teacher.

265
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:41,446
But I know why I'm here.

266
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,990
To be a pilot.

267
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,700
And you don't dogfight
with manuals.

268
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:46,743
You don't fly with gauges.

269
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,078
I mean, it's all about
feeling and speed...

270
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:49,496
and lettin' that plane
become like a part...

271
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:51,123
of your body.
And that manual...

272
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,458
says that a guy who's a slow
reader can't be a good pilot.

273
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:55,544
That file says I'm
the best pilot in this room.

274
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:04,511
Ma'am, please,
don't take my wings.

275
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:07,973
Well, I felt so bad.

276
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,767
Evelyn, rotate to station three.

277
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,144
I had no choice.

278
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:14,188
I passed him.

279
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,564
- Good.
- Uh-huh.

280
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:18,567
So, then this
cocky pilot comes back.

281
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:20,861
- Say, fella, are you enlisted?
- Yeah.

282
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,030
"Yeah"? Boy,
you're talking to an officer.

283
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:24,364
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

284
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:25,699
- Give me that file.
- Yes, sir.

285
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:28,076
- Parade rest.
- Yes, sir.

286
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,870
Ma'am, I didn't get
a chance to thank you.

287
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:31,121
Drop your skivvies.

288
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:34,208
Ah, oh, OK.

289
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:37,044
Just like this?

290
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:38,921
That's fine.

291
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:41,673
He did have
a very cute butt.

292
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:43,217
You know, I know
you didn't have to pass me...

293
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,551
and you did. And I just-

294
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:47,387
I didn't think
you'd understand, and you did.

295
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:50,098
You know, you still
haven't said thank you.

296
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:51,308
Thank you.

297
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,393
You're welcome.

298
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:56,438
Why'd you do it?
I mean, I'm just curious.

299
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,232
You're like my hero now.

300
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:00,067
Actually, my father was a pilot.

301
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,444
And, um, I've seen
first-hand what happens...

302
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:04,112
when a pilot loses his wings.

303
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:05,322
You know what?

304
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,699
Your father's my hero,
then, too.

305
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:11,286
Infact, as an officer,
I think it'd by my duty...

306
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,747
to take my new hero's
daughter out tonight...

307
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:16,083
Just to-aah!

308
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,459
Gosh, did I poke too deep?

309
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:20,170
I think you hit the bone there.

310
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,006
You are so mean.

311
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,928
What? So is-
is there any chance...

312
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,222
that you might,
kind of, sort of...

313
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:32,891
you know, like me, or...

314
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:37,145
Oh, how did you guess?

315
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:38,730
They never taught us...

316
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:41,275
how to deal with this...
feeling.

317
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,571
Wh-what feeling?

318
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:48,949
Well, it's kind of like... this.

319
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,617
Ow!

320
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:53,412
Well, he was getting fresh,
so I poked him again.

321
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,083
All right, Romeo.
I want to get this over with.

322
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:00,335
Hold on a second.

323
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:01,461
Miss...

324
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:03,881
I really, really lick you.

325
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:07,467
What did he mean?

326
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,219
Like you.

327
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:10,512
I didn't mean to say that.

328
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:11,805
And I just, um...

329
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,308
I just want to ask you, please,
if I can donate dinner.

330
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,435
He started
to act very strange.

331
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:19,521
Or, well, buy you dinner.

332
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:21,148
This isn't your chart.

333
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,275
Whoa.

334
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:27,362
No. That's the, uh, this,
uh, fellow over here's.

335
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:28,572
I think he left.

336
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,282
Have you already had this shot?

337
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:33,202
Yeah, well, once... already.

338
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,997
Well, I wanted-
I mean, can I ask you out?

339
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:39,082
No!

340
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,293
And he just went wham!

341
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:44,922
Unh!

342
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:47,341
Oh! What'd you do to him?

343
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:50,052
Poor guy.

344
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:56,433
Hey!

345
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:57,893
Oh, my God.
Are you OK?

346
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:00,103
Uh, yeah.

347
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,647
I'm fine. I feel great.

348
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:06,151
This is just standard
precautionary... thing.

349
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:09,655
Look, I got some, uh,
genuine French champagne...

350
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:10,948
from France.

351
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,700
I thought, you know,
maybe we could celebrate.

352
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,077
Celebrate what?

353
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,915
Oh, I don't know. Uh, well,
you being my hero, for one.

354
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,212
OK. Why not?

355
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:28,799
So, uh, ahem...

356
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,300
I wanted to thank you.

357
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:32,135
And I just wanted to, uh...

358
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:34,721
put your mind at ease
about passing me...

359
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:37,891
because I really do think
you did this country a service.

360
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:41,353
I mean, I'm-
I am a great flier.

361
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:44,398
And if you have a fault,
which you obviously don't...

362
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:47,067
it's modesty.

363
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:51,029
No. If I have a fault,
it's candor.

364
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,491
You are just so-

365
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,663
Uhh. Cork just got away from me.

366
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:10,090
God, oh, it hurts.

367
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:13,844
It hurts something fierce.

368
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,095
I'm sorry.

369
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:16,680
- Ohh...
- Oh, it's bleeding.

370
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,849
- God.
- Oh!

371
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,934
- Ohh!
- Lay still.

372
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:22,144
I ruined everything.

373
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:23,562
- Lay still.
- Oh, it hurts.

374
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:25,731
- Ow! It's cold.
- It'll stop the bleeding.

375
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,399
Yeah. I can't breathe.

376
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:30,027
Lay still.

377
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:36,283
You are so beautiful it hurts.

378
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:39,453
It's your nose that hurts.

379
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:42,915
No. I think it's my heart.

380
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:53,383
And then I kissed him.

381
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:55,928
Oh, Evelyn.

382
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:58,639
That's the most romantic story
I ever heard.

383
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:04,269
It's been the most romantic four
weeks and two days of my life.

384
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:06,146
Oh, I'm so jealous.

385
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:26,875
Hello, Lieutenant.

386
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:29,253
- It's good to see you.
- You, too, Lieutenant.

387
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,505
Pick a hand.

388
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:37,219
It's beautiful.

389
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:41,056
What's in your other hand?

390
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,599
Mine.

391
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:47,563
Well, it took me six hours
to fold these.

392
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:50,357
Oh!

393
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,945
I want you to meet my friends.

394
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:58,198
Rafe, this is Martha,
Barbara, Sandra-

395
00:19:58,282 --> 00:20:01,034
- Hi. I'm Betty.
- Hi.

396
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:03,370
Would you happen
to have any friends?

397
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:06,790
Huh. Take your pick.

398
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:08,458
Hi.

399
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:15,299
Whoo!

400
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:35,235
We ever get in this war
and somethin' happens to me...

401
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:39,281
I can't tell you how good
it makes me feel to know...

402
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:41,783
that someone as sweet
as you will be there...

403
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:43,535
to nurse me back to health.

404
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:45,954
Good, but we're not
in the war yet.

405
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:48,540
- Ahem.
- OK. That was a bad line.

406
00:20:48,624 --> 00:20:50,918
Hi.

407
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:53,587
I'm-I'm Red.

408
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:59,218
Red-
S- s-s-s-strange.

409
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:01,094
Heh heh.
Your last name's Strange?

410
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:02,554
Yeah. She's all yours, soldier.

411
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:05,015
No. It-it's Winkle.

412
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,519
Red is such a ladies' man.

413
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:09,728
Do you always stutter?

414
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:13,524
No. Only when I'm-

415
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:14,775
She's totally buying it.

416
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,777
- Nervous?
- Yeah.

417
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:18,487
Why can't I get
something like that?

418
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:27,996
Hello.

419
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,623
Hi.

420
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:32,251
Danny seems kind of shy
around the girls.

421
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:35,754
Tsk. It's not that he's shy.

422
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:37,089
He's just, ahem...

423
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:39,591
a little unsure of himself,
you know.

424
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:41,552
His old man used to
run him down a lot.

425
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:45,305
Get him in a plane,
he's sure of himself.

426
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:47,599
He's like my brother.
He's like my best friend.

427
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:50,310
He's my right hand.

428
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:54,815
Which at the moment is
a long way south of my waist.

429
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:56,483
Oh, I'm sorry.

430
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:59,152
I guess I lost
a little altitude.

431
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:01,196
Yeah, I guess you did.

432
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:02,739
Excuse me.

433
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:19,715
You and me, we got to talk.

434
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:23,385
So, the rumor is the Navy's
shipping us to Pearl Harbor.

435
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,429
Well, won't be so bad.

436
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:28,098
It's about as far from
the fighting as you can get.

437
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:30,017
You'll get a sun tan.

438
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:33,687
So maybe the Army'll
post you guys there, too.

439
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,816
You... are a super special woman.

440
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,276
And, and, well...

441
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:42,738
Well, they're-
they're training me...

442
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:47,951
to be a big bad warrior,
and, well...

443
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:52,498
So, I mean, you never know
what might happen tomorrow...

444
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:58,086
or... or any day
after that, you know?

445
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:00,672
So...

446
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:03,842
God, we need to make
tonight super special.

447
00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:06,512
Why are you crying?

448
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:08,222
I guess it's the thought...

449
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:10,724
that I might not ever
get to see you again.

450
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:12,518
Dry your eyes, toots.

451
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:13,727
Tonight, you're mine.

452
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,938
I don't want to be
with a crowd tonight.

453
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:18,565
I just want to be
alone with you.

454
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:20,567
Well...

455
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:23,487
How does New York Harbor
by moonlight sound?

456
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:25,739
Ohh! Heh heh!

457
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:28,283
Are you gonna be
a bad influence?

458
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:30,786
Of course I'm a bad influence.

459
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:32,788
Let's see if we can
commandeer this vessel...

460
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,082
'cause we're, uh, officers
of the U.S. Government.

461
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:36,875
Not for long, we won't be.

462
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:50,264
One day, we'll take a trip
on a boat like that.

463
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:51,682
Would you like that?

464
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:55,936
We'll be dressing for cocktails
and walk into the grandsalon.

465
00:23:55,978 --> 00:23:57,604
No one's talking about war.

466
00:23:57,646 --> 00:23:59,940
They're just dancing
to Cole Porter.

467
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:02,609
- I'll have to get a tux.
- Yeah.

468
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:09,741
Come on. There you go.
All aboard.

469
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:11,869
- You're out of your mind.
- Oh, yeah.

470
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:13,245
Careful now.
Here, sit down.

471
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:16,456
Now let's see here.

472
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:22,171
Ah! There we go.

473
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:26,884
See, this is as close as I
could get you to your ship.

474
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:29,094
So, at least I tried, right?

475
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:33,015
Actually, you know what?
This is better.

476
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,933
Yeah, it is.

477
00:24:35,017 --> 00:24:37,477
God, you're pretty.

478
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:59,458
What's gonna become
of us all, Rafe?

479
00:25:01,168 --> 00:25:05,964
Well, the future's not
exactly in our hands, is it?

480
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,675
No. I guess you're right.

481
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:20,395
- Aah!
- Aah!

482
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:23,023
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?

483
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:24,358
Yeah, are you?

484
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:26,026
That was not part of the date.

485
00:25:33,242 --> 00:25:34,368
Watch your step.

486
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:37,037
Oh, thank you.

487
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,372
Evelyn!

488
00:25:38,497 --> 00:25:41,124
Guys, come up! Come on up!

489
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,086
Come up! We're in 321.

490
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:46,088
There's something
I got to tell you.

491
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:48,298
Well, you got no secrets
from me, Lieutenant.

492
00:25:48,382 --> 00:25:49,925
I've seen your medical chart.

493
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:51,426
Here we go.

494
00:25:57,432 --> 00:26:00,727
This can't be good, or it
wouldn't be so hard to say.

495
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:02,354
Yep.

496
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:04,857
I got to go away.

497
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,359
We're all going away.

498
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:09,194
Yeah...

499
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:12,906
but I'm going to the war...
tomorrow.

500
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:15,909
I'm flying with
the Eagle Squadron.

501
00:26:15,993 --> 00:26:20,247
It's an outfit the British
started for American pilots.

502
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:24,376
I don't understand.

503
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:27,379
You're in the U.S. Army.
How could they order you to go?

504
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:29,882
They didn't order me.

505
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:32,050
I volunteered.

506
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:36,972
Huh.

507
00:26:37,014 --> 00:26:39,224
But I passed you.

508
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:41,977
I let you through.

509
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,729
And now you volunteer...

510
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:45,898
for the most dangerous place
you could go?

511
00:26:45,981 --> 00:26:49,943
It's not your responsibility,
not your choice.

512
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:52,863
Flying's the only thing
I ever wanted to do.

513
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:57,242
I mean, everything in my life
has led me up to this point.

514
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:01,622
Meeting you.

515
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:06,460
I love you.

516
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:10,923
I love you so much.

517
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:15,761
Let's go inside.

518
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:25,729
All right. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

519
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:27,439
Just-I-I can't do this.

520
00:27:27,523 --> 00:27:31,193
This just-it's not right.
I'm sorry. I just-

521
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:32,736
See, I can't do this.

522
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:35,864
I mean, I mean, I can.
I- I want to.

523
00:27:35,948 --> 00:27:38,784
I'm not trying to be noble,
you know.

524
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:41,036
Or not saying
I know what would happen...

525
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,163
or just-
I need to stop talking.

526
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:45,040
I just-I just don't want-

527
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:46,834
I just don't want it
to be like everybody else.

528
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:48,877
I don't want you to have
anything about tonight...

529
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:50,754
that you regret.

530
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:54,174
I mean, it's been the most
incredible night of my life...

531
00:27:54,258 --> 00:27:56,593
and I don't want to ruin that.

532
00:27:56,677 --> 00:27:58,637
Oh, you couldn't ruin it.

533
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:05,978
If I had one more night to live,
I'd want to spend it with you.

534
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:09,731
See, that's what I want
to come home to.

535
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:13,193
That's what I want to have
to think about and dream about.

536
00:28:13,235 --> 00:28:15,863
I want to know that
the best part of my life...

537
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:17,781
is still ahead of me.

538
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:20,534
Look.

539
00:28:20,576 --> 00:28:26,373
Don't, um... could you...
not come see me off?

540
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:29,960
Because, uh... saying good-bye
to you once is hard enough.

541
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:35,424
Here.

542
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:39,219
Take this.

543
00:28:39,261 --> 00:28:41,889
Why?
You think it looks good on me?

544
00:28:46,268 --> 00:28:48,395
I will come back.

545
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:27,184
I thought you said
you told her not to come.

546
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:28,519
Yeah, I did.

547
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:30,270
Why you looking for her then?

548
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:33,023
It's my test.

549
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:35,192
If I tell her not to come,
and she comes anyway...

550
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:37,611
then I-I know she loves me.

551
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:39,905
All aboard! Track 57!

552
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:47,538
If, uh, anything
happens to me...

553
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:49,957
I want you to be the one
to tell her.

554
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,542
All right?

555
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:55,295
You just make sure and come back
for the both of us, all right?

556
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:57,840
OK.

557
00:30:08,851 --> 00:30:10,519
See you when I get back.

558
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:11,937
Yeah.

559
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,401
Good hunting, Rafe.

560
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:42,092
Evelyn!

561
00:30:42,217 --> 00:30:43,343
Evelyn!

562
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:45,345
Evelyn!

563
00:30:49,725 --> 00:30:51,101
Evelyn!

564
00:30:51,185 --> 00:30:52,436
Evelyn.

565
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,813
Hey!

566
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:03,363
She loves me.

567
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:08,076
The German Luftwaffe...

568
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:11,205
relentlessly bombards
downtown London...

569
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,248
while Churchill's
Royal Air Force...

570
00:31:13,332 --> 00:31:14,750
is in a deadly struggle...

571
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:17,920
to maintain control
of the British skies.

572
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:41,318
This is a real mess.

573
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:45,030
Lieutenant McCawley
reporting for duty, sir.

574
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:48,492
Good.

575
00:31:48,617 --> 00:31:51,370
We'll get you settled
into your quarters.

576
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:54,706
And then introduce you
to the crate you'll be flying.

577
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:58,210
If y'all are patching up
bullet holes here...

578
00:31:58,293 --> 00:31:59,503
maybe we ought
to skip housekeeping...

579
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:00,921
and get me in an airplane.

580
00:32:00,963 --> 00:32:02,256
Two didn't come back, sir.

581
00:32:02,297 --> 00:32:04,091
We counted only eleven.

582
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:12,850
Are all Yanks
as anxious as you...

583
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:14,935
to get themselves killed,
Pilot Officer?

584
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:18,230
Not anxious to die, sir.
Just anxious to matter.

585
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:25,863
This is yours.

586
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:29,074
Good chap.

587
00:32:29,158 --> 00:32:32,244
Didn't die till he'd landed
and shut down his engine.

588
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,135
Please be seated, gentlemen.

589
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,807
I'm afraid I'm in a bad mood.

590
00:32:53,891 --> 00:32:59,146
Churchill and Stalin are
asking me what I'm asking you.

591
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:02,232
How long is America
going to pretend...

592
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:04,067
the world is not at war?

593
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:06,904
We've increased food and oil
shipments, Mr. President...

594
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:08,280
and as far as I know-

595
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:10,949
What they really need
are tanks, planes...

596
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:12,743
bullets, bombs,
and men to fight.

597
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:16,997
But our people think
Hitler and his Nazi thugs...

598
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,124
are Europe's problem.

599
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:22,669
We have to do more.

600
00:33:22,753 --> 00:33:25,214
Send the Brits and Russians
more of our ships...

601
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:26,798
and anti-aircraft weapons.

602
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:28,800
And keep cannibalizing
the Pacific Fleet?

603
00:33:28,884 --> 00:33:30,385
What choice do we have?

604
00:33:30,511 --> 00:33:35,224
We're building refrigerators
while our enemies build bombs.

605
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:45,586
This is so exciting.

606
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:48,130
You know there's about
one hundred ships on Pearl.

607
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:49,631
How many sailors per ship?

608
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:52,050
It depends.
More on a battleship than a sub.

609
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:54,595
But say, on average... 2,000?

610
00:34:54,636 --> 00:34:57,890
Then there's the flyers,
the marines, base personnel.

611
00:34:57,973 --> 00:34:59,266
I'm still working on
the sailors.

612
00:34:59,308 --> 00:35:01,810
Girls, I think the odds
are in your favor.

613
00:35:01,852 --> 00:35:03,687
Yeah, like 4,000 to one.

614
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:06,273
It's paradise.

615
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:08,192
See you on the beach, boys!

616
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:10,777
We're in Hawaii!

617
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:18,619
Hey!

618
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:21,205
You're not supposed
to paint titties...

619
00:35:21,288 --> 00:35:22,623
on the side of my airplanes.

620
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:25,292
And if you do,
don't make 'em lopsided.

621
00:35:25,334 --> 00:35:26,460
They were lopsided, Earl.

622
00:35:26,543 --> 00:35:27,794
Look, it says right here.

623
00:35:27,878 --> 00:35:32,132
"Never ride waves amongst
rocks or submerged pilings. "

624
00:35:32,216 --> 00:35:33,967
See, it says
you shouldn't do that.

625
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:37,012
How do you know they're
submerged if they're submerged?

626
00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:39,640
Gooz, what in the hell
are you doing?

627
00:35:39,723 --> 00:35:41,642
Just trying to fix
this surfboard thing.

628
00:35:41,683 --> 00:35:43,810
He keeps taking chunks off
his nose on the rocks.

629
00:35:43,936 --> 00:35:46,355
On my day off, I'm working
on my new invention-

630
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:49,107
the Gooz Cruise Fin.

631
00:35:49,191 --> 00:35:50,651
I'm gonna be a rich fella.

632
00:35:50,692 --> 00:35:52,820
Every surfboard in
the nation's gonna need one.

633
00:35:52,903 --> 00:35:54,571
Yeah? Well,
you're gonna need a broom.

634
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:57,115
Check out these new recruits.

635
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:00,661
Hi.

636
00:36:00,702 --> 00:36:02,496
Aloha.

637
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:04,998
Y'all pilots?

638
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,125
We're working on it.

639
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:09,169
It's a lot of switches
and stuff.

640
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:14,091
Pride of the Pacific.

641
00:36:14,216 --> 00:36:16,677
Who are you?

642
00:36:16,718 --> 00:36:18,262
Terrors of the skies.

643
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:22,057
Welcome, ladies.

644
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,767
Hi.

645
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:26,520
I have to deal with
toasty sun burnt fanny...

646
00:36:26,562 --> 00:36:28,689
before I can show you around.

647
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:30,816
Ow!

648
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,612
Dear Evelyn.

649
00:36:35,696 --> 00:36:38,365
It's different than I thought
it would be here.

650
00:36:38,407 --> 00:36:40,033
It's cold-

651
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:45,038
so cold it goes deep
into your bones.

652
00:36:45,122 --> 00:36:48,083
There is one place
I can go to find warmth.

653
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:50,460
That is to think of you.

654
00:36:50,544 --> 00:36:53,005
I just wish I could be
back there with you.

655
00:36:56,258 --> 00:36:58,677
It's not easy making friends.

656
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,053
Two days ago, I had a beer...

657
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:02,097
with a couple
of the RAF pilots.

658
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:04,308
Yesterday,
both of them got killed.

659
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:19,198
Dear Rafe.

660
00:37:19,323 --> 00:37:21,867
I miss you so much.

661
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:25,787
It's so strange to be
half a world away from you.

662
00:37:27,164 --> 00:37:28,624
I'm right on his tail!

663
00:37:34,671 --> 00:37:37,382
Got one!

664
00:37:37,466 --> 00:37:40,427
Every night
I look at the sunset...

665
00:37:40,511 --> 00:37:43,889
and try to draw the last ounce
of heat from its long day...

666
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:47,518
and send it
from my heart to yours.

667
00:37:53,482 --> 00:37:54,608
Family?

668
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:57,820
Girl, sir.

669
00:37:57,945 --> 00:38:00,405
The girl.

670
00:38:02,074 --> 00:38:04,284
A lot of people
frown on the Yanks...

671
00:38:04,368 --> 00:38:05,994
for not being in this war yet.

672
00:38:06,078 --> 00:38:07,913
I'd just like to say...

673
00:38:07,996 --> 00:38:10,916
if there are many more
back home like you...

674
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:14,336
God help anyone who goes
to war with America.

675
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:21,844
Atten-hut!

676
00:38:21,927 --> 00:38:24,429
Attention on deck!
Admiral Kimmel...

677
00:38:24,513 --> 00:38:26,807
Commander-in-Chief,
Pacific Fleet, on deck.

678
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,058
Sharp presentation, Captain.

679
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:29,852
Thank you, Admiral Kimmel.

680
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:32,771
For four months now Washington's
been blowing pink smoke...

681
00:38:32,855 --> 00:38:34,398
about the threat from Japan.

682
00:38:34,523 --> 00:38:35,983
Could make us lose
our fighting edge.

683
00:38:36,108 --> 00:38:37,734
I'm determined
not to let that happen.

684
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:45,701
With your permission, Captain.

685
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:48,787
Admiral, urgent,
from Washington.

686
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:54,668
I'm supposed
to keep this fleet...

687
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,503
battle-ready
to take on the Japanese...

688
00:38:56,545 --> 00:38:58,797
cover half the damn globe.

689
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:00,382
Now they want me to transfer...

690
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:01,884
another twelve destroyers
to the Atlantic.

691
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:03,468
Don't they know what
we're facing out here?

692
00:39:03,552 --> 00:39:05,512
They feel Europe
is the greater danger.

693
00:39:05,554 --> 00:39:08,557
I'm assuming these risk
assessments include Hawaii?

694
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:11,685
Pearl Harbor is too shallow
for an aerial torpedo attack.

695
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:13,145
We're surrounded by sub nets.

696
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:15,355
All we need worry
about is sabotage...

697
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:17,024
so we bunched
our planes together...

698
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:18,775
to make them easier to protect.

699
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:20,944
Distance is our ally, Admiral.

700
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:25,032
You analysts got it
all figured out, don't you?

701
00:39:25,115 --> 00:39:27,409
The smart enemy hits you...

702
00:39:27,493 --> 00:39:29,203
exactly where
you think you're safe.

703
00:40:39,648 --> 00:40:41,984
Incoming!

704
00:40:52,536 --> 00:40:54,872
I fixed the hydraulics
and electrics, sir...

705
00:40:54,955 --> 00:40:56,874
but the oil hoses
still need attention.

706
00:40:56,957 --> 00:40:58,083
Just crank it, Ian!

707
00:40:58,167 --> 00:40:59,459
God speed you, sir.

708
00:41:08,844 --> 00:41:10,137
Red section, take the bombers.

709
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:12,681
Blue section,
look out for the fighters.

710
00:41:12,764 --> 00:41:14,474
Bombers dead ahead.

711
00:41:14,558 --> 00:41:16,727
Let's drop in
and give 'em a reception.

712
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:22,149
Red Two, follow my lead,
high side.

713
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:23,525
Go right at the lead bomber.

714
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:24,735
Following you, Red One.

715
00:41:32,826 --> 00:41:33,994
Good hit! Good hit!

716
00:41:38,957 --> 00:41:40,959
Red One, coming around,
reset for the kill.

717
00:41:43,545 --> 00:41:44,713
I have the middle bomber.

718
00:41:49,051 --> 00:41:50,177
Hammer down!

719
00:41:55,224 --> 00:41:57,809
We got him.
Nice shot, Red Two.

720
00:41:57,893 --> 00:42:00,354
I got two M.E.s dead ahead.

721
00:42:05,317 --> 00:42:07,611
I'm on him.
I'm on his tail.

722
00:42:07,694 --> 00:42:09,196
Hammer down.

723
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:13,242
I got one of them!

724
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,171
I got another one.

725
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:28,715
Red One, you got fighters
all over your tail!

726
00:42:29,925 --> 00:42:31,468
I'm under fire!
I'm taking fire!

727
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:37,683
Red One, get out of there.
Pull up! Pull up!

728
00:42:42,938 --> 00:42:45,399
Argh! I got an oil leak.

729
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:51,113
Can't see a damn thing!

730
00:42:53,532 --> 00:42:56,034
I can't bail!
My canopy's stuck!

731
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,744
I can't bail out!

732
00:43:07,421 --> 00:43:08,922
He's on my tail, Red Two.

733
00:43:12,801 --> 00:43:14,803
I'm hit! I'm hit!

734
00:43:22,811 --> 00:43:24,813
Mayday! Mayday!

735
00:43:29,526 --> 00:43:31,612
Oh, my God.

736
00:43:45,501 --> 00:43:46,835
I'm no good at church.

737
00:43:46,919 --> 00:43:48,128
What do you mean, sweetie?

738
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:51,590
When I'm up there getting
my slate wiped clean...

739
00:43:51,673 --> 00:43:54,510
I'm thinking how
to dirty it up again.

740
00:43:54,593 --> 00:43:55,719
Wow, this from a virgin!

741
00:43:55,802 --> 00:43:57,638
I got to inventory supplies.

742
00:43:57,721 --> 00:43:59,598
Kill me now.

743
00:43:59,681 --> 00:44:01,517
Could you be any more boring?

744
00:44:01,642 --> 00:44:03,936
Don't bother.
Sunday, she writes Rafe...

745
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:06,438
ten pages instead
of the usual five.

746
00:44:07,731 --> 00:44:09,525
Gosh, I wish I was in love.

747
00:44:11,985 --> 00:44:13,737
Hey, sweetheart.

748
00:44:15,072 --> 00:44:16,281
She hates me.

749
00:44:17,533 --> 00:44:18,742
Good to see you, Red.

750
00:44:18,826 --> 00:44:21,286
Good to see you, too, Betty.

751
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:22,871
You wanna come for a ride?

752
00:44:22,913 --> 00:44:24,373
Come on.

753
00:44:24,414 --> 00:44:26,667
Yeah, I'll be your chauffeur.

754
00:44:38,554 --> 00:44:39,888
That-a-boy! Be a mad dog!

755
00:44:39,972 --> 00:44:43,392
You hit pretty hard...
for a cook.

756
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:47,688
All right, Walker,
who you got?

757
00:44:47,771 --> 00:44:49,481
I'll take the cook.

758
00:44:49,565 --> 00:44:50,774
Why? You don't like money?

759
00:44:53,735 --> 00:44:55,487
Come on! Get out there now!

760
00:44:58,907 --> 00:45:01,368
- I'll put five on it.
- Done.

761
00:45:02,786 --> 00:45:04,163
Against a mechanic?

762
00:45:04,246 --> 00:45:06,081
That guy craps rivets.

763
00:45:06,206 --> 00:45:07,416
How's it feel up
from the engine room?

764
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:08,792
Sunlight botherin' you?

765
00:45:10,085 --> 00:45:11,211
Ow.

766
00:45:12,754 --> 00:45:14,298
Man, he's getting all busted up!

767
00:45:15,632 --> 00:45:17,009
Move! Move!

768
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:20,053
Come here, we gotta talk.

769
00:45:20,137 --> 00:45:21,513
Get down here.

770
00:45:21,597 --> 00:45:22,806
He can't hurt us.

771
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:24,933
He can hurt us.

772
00:45:25,017 --> 00:45:27,352
- He cut us. We bleeding.
- Bleeding?

773
00:45:27,436 --> 00:45:30,230
That's a scratch. See this?

774
00:45:30,272 --> 00:45:31,690
This is the hard-earned
greenbacks...

775
00:45:31,773 --> 00:45:34,234
of every pot-scrubbin'
chop in this fleet.

776
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:35,777
Now if we don't win...

777
00:45:35,861 --> 00:45:38,113
Teeny here has to find
another battleship!

778
00:45:38,197 --> 00:45:40,407
I'm not going back
to the Arizona empty-handed.

779
00:45:40,532 --> 00:45:43,160
Don't worry about the money.

780
00:45:43,285 --> 00:45:46,580
I'll send that
smug engine-fixin' snipe...

781
00:45:46,622 --> 00:45:48,123
back below decks where he belong.

782
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:51,084
We the man!

783
00:45:51,168 --> 00:45:53,420
He slapped your mama!
Be a son of a bitch!

784
00:46:02,346 --> 00:46:03,680
Look at this!
All right, Dorie!

785
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,238
That's enough. That's enough.

786
00:46:22,991 --> 00:46:26,578
- Oh! Where's my money?
- Nah, fight's rigged.

787
00:46:26,662 --> 00:46:29,122
We're rich! Ha ha ha!

788
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:32,960
How'd you get this?

789
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:35,128
Boxing.

790
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:36,713
Did you win?

791
00:46:36,797 --> 00:46:38,632
Yes, ma'am.

792
00:46:38,715 --> 00:46:42,553
What do you get for winning?

793
00:46:42,636 --> 00:46:44,221
Respect.

794
00:46:49,017 --> 00:46:53,480
So, why do you have to fight
with your fists to get respect?

795
00:46:53,605 --> 00:46:55,816
I left my momma in Texas...

796
00:46:55,858 --> 00:46:57,943
and joined the Navy
to see the world...

797
00:46:58,026 --> 00:47:00,112
become a man.

798
00:47:00,195 --> 00:47:02,948
They made me a cook.

799
00:47:03,031 --> 00:47:04,241
Not even that.

800
00:47:04,324 --> 00:47:07,411
I clean up after
other sailors eat.

801
00:47:07,494 --> 00:47:12,791
Two years, they never even
let me fire a weapon.

802
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:15,586
Well, let's hope
you never have to.

803
00:47:16,837 --> 00:47:18,088
Yes, ma'am.

804
00:47:18,172 --> 00:47:20,007
You take care,
Petty Officer Miller.

805
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:21,675
You, too, ma'am.

806
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:08,096
You know,
he taught me to fly.

807
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:10,891
I always knew that no matter
what trouble I got into...

808
00:48:10,974 --> 00:48:13,519
I'd never be in it alone.

809
00:48:13,602 --> 00:48:18,023
He'd be there with me.

810
00:48:18,106 --> 00:48:21,652
He was always pushing me
to be better and faster.

811
00:48:23,821 --> 00:48:26,657
He told me
you were a great flier.

812
00:48:27,783 --> 00:48:29,576
It was the same night
he told me...

813
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,662
he'd volunteered
to go to England.

814
00:48:33,747 --> 00:48:36,625
Volunteered?

815
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:41,255
He... he told me
he'd been assigned.

816
00:48:45,217 --> 00:48:48,428
He was always
trying to protect me.

817
00:48:51,932 --> 00:48:53,433
But you know what?

818
00:48:53,517 --> 00:48:56,270
I look at myself in
the mirror in this uniform...

819
00:48:56,311 --> 00:48:59,690
and I still
don't know who I am.

820
00:48:59,815 --> 00:49:03,068
I look like a hero...

821
00:49:03,152 --> 00:49:05,779
but I don't feel like it.

822
00:49:07,656 --> 00:49:10,909
Rafe...

823
00:49:10,993 --> 00:49:14,621
he always looked the part,
didn't he?

824
00:49:14,705 --> 00:49:16,915
He couldn't wait to be one.

825
00:49:39,938 --> 00:49:42,900
To Rafe McCawley.

826
00:49:43,025 --> 00:49:46,487
The best pilot...

827
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:50,324
and the best friend
I ever knew...

828
00:49:50,365 --> 00:49:51,950
or ever will know.

829
00:49:56,205 --> 00:49:57,831
To Rafe.

830
00:51:04,273 --> 00:51:05,732
THUR Look at this.
The Japanese...

831
00:51:05,774 --> 00:51:07,860
are flooding the Pacific
with radio traffic.

832
00:51:07,943 --> 00:51:11,321
Everywhere from the Panama Canal
to southeast Asia.

833
00:51:11,405 --> 00:51:12,865
There's no logical pattern,
Captain.

834
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:14,408
No. There's always logic.

835
00:51:14,491 --> 00:51:16,743
They know we read their mail.

836
00:51:16,827 --> 00:51:21,039
They're trying to make us think
their fleet is moving south.

837
00:51:21,123 --> 00:51:22,916
I'm not buying it.

838
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:26,003
Something, something's up.

839
00:51:26,086 --> 00:51:29,882
Otherwise, why would they take
the trouble to bullshit me?

840
00:51:44,354 --> 00:51:48,817
Evelyn, I signed for
these letters for you today.

841
00:51:48,942 --> 00:51:51,361
They're from England.

842
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:53,030
They're from Rafe.

843
00:51:53,155 --> 00:51:55,115
I'm sorry, Ev.

844
00:51:55,157 --> 00:51:57,910
You know how long
it takes mail to get here.

845
00:52:11,507 --> 00:52:12,633
Hurry up!

846
00:52:12,716 --> 00:52:14,301
Show time, boys! Come on!

847
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:20,015
America still
awaits Japan's response...

848
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:21,517
to peace proposals.

849
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,061
Ambassador Nomura
arrives in Washington...

850
00:52:24,144 --> 00:52:25,687
in what could
hopefully guarantee...

851
00:52:25,813 --> 00:52:28,106
continued peace in the Pacific.

852
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:30,567
On the British front,
Churchill declares...

853
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:33,695
"Give us the tools,
and we will finish the job. "

854
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:38,367
The RAF has fought
bravely against...

855
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:43,330
Hitler's ambition to rule
the skies over the Channel.

856
00:52:43,372 --> 00:52:46,875
Victory does not come
without sacrifice.

857
00:52:49,211 --> 00:52:50,337
Evelyn!

858
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:51,839
- Danny.
- Hey.

859
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,799
Some comedy, huh?

860
00:52:54,883 --> 00:52:56,885
Yeah.

861
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:58,971
It's been a while.

862
00:52:59,054 --> 00:53:01,557
I've been logging
a lot of flight hours.

863
00:53:01,682 --> 00:53:04,518
I kinda been avoiding you, too.

864
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,311
Yeah.

865
00:53:06,395 --> 00:53:08,564
- Look-
- Do you-

866
00:53:08,647 --> 00:53:09,857
Do you want to?

867
00:53:09,898 --> 00:53:12,025
Sure, yeah.

868
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:14,069
I remember
one time when I was...

869
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,654
like, seven years old...

870
00:53:15,737 --> 00:53:18,115
I was always building
gadgets and things.

871
00:53:18,198 --> 00:53:20,242
He wanted me
to build him some wings...

872
00:53:20,325 --> 00:53:22,161
so he could fly like his daddy.

873
00:53:22,244 --> 00:53:25,372
I told him you can't fly
without some kind of engine.

874
00:53:25,414 --> 00:53:27,040
But he wouldn't listen.

875
00:53:27,124 --> 00:53:29,585
"Danny, never mind that,
just build 'em anyway. "

876
00:53:29,668 --> 00:53:31,837
So I did.

877
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,547
And I'm up there...

878
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:35,591
strapping these big ol' wings
on his back...

879
00:53:35,716 --> 00:53:37,551
that we made
from paper and glue...

880
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:39,970
and these massive silk bloomers
that we stole.

881
00:53:40,053 --> 00:53:42,472
He looked so stupid,
and I told him...

882
00:53:42,556 --> 00:53:44,892
"You can't jump off the barn
in these. "

883
00:53:44,933 --> 00:53:46,643
And bam!

884
00:53:46,727 --> 00:53:49,354
He busted his leg on a backhoe.

885
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:55,903
God, I miss him.

886
00:53:55,986 --> 00:53:59,114
Yeah. But don't you think...

887
00:53:59,198 --> 00:54:01,283
that Rafe wasn't
back up there next day.

888
00:54:01,408 --> 00:54:02,701
Cast and everything...

889
00:54:02,784 --> 00:54:06,538
telling me to make some
adjustments on those wings.

890
00:54:06,622 --> 00:54:08,081
Check this out!

891
00:54:08,165 --> 00:54:09,958
Crossroads of the Pacific.

892
00:54:10,042 --> 00:54:12,961
Tahiti-1,700 miles!

893
00:54:13,045 --> 00:54:15,255
All right!

894
00:54:15,297 --> 00:54:17,549
Say, Betty...

895
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:25,307
W- wou...

896
00:54:26,475 --> 00:54:28,519
- No, Betty! Get up!
- What's going on, Red?

897
00:54:28,602 --> 00:54:31,480
- Stand up, please.
- What do you mean?

898
00:54:31,563 --> 00:54:33,357
Just stand up.

899
00:54:33,482 --> 00:54:35,442
Stand...

900
00:54:35,526 --> 00:54:37,945
Oh! Ha!

901
00:54:38,028 --> 00:54:39,613
Betty...

902
00:54:39,696 --> 00:54:40,781
Red, come on!

903
00:54:40,906 --> 00:54:43,534
We got a dinner reservation.

904
00:54:45,327 --> 00:54:46,954
Can I get a minute?

905
00:54:48,956 --> 00:54:50,415
What's the matter, you sick?

906
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:53,752
Can a guy propose?!

907
00:54:55,587 --> 00:54:57,422
Oh! Thank you!

908
00:54:57,506 --> 00:54:59,299
Am I talking too much?

909
00:54:59,383 --> 00:55:01,969
Sometimes I do that, I'm sorry.

910
00:55:04,096 --> 00:55:05,264
Hold up!

911
00:55:05,347 --> 00:55:06,974
Look at this.

912
00:55:07,057 --> 00:55:08,600
Hello!

913
00:55:08,684 --> 00:55:11,186
OK, let's get out of here.

914
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:12,437
OK.

915
00:55:15,149 --> 00:55:17,568
I guess I should go.

916
00:55:17,651 --> 00:55:20,320
Don't let it be three months
before I see you again.

917
00:55:20,404 --> 00:55:21,738
I had a good time.

918
00:55:21,822 --> 00:55:23,073
Yeah, me, too.

919
00:55:24,658 --> 00:55:26,493
Do you want me
to walk you home?

920
00:55:26,535 --> 00:55:28,162
No, I'll be fine.

921
00:55:28,203 --> 00:55:30,122
No... of course.

922
00:55:30,205 --> 00:55:32,332
- Good night.
- Good night.

923
00:55:44,303 --> 00:55:47,556
I was just wondering if maybe
I could come by some time...

924
00:55:47,639 --> 00:55:50,350
get a cup of coffee
or a piece of pie?

925
00:55:50,434 --> 00:55:53,145
What am I doing?

926
00:55:54,438 --> 00:55:56,023
OK.

927
00:55:59,485 --> 00:56:01,570
Oh! You were asleep. I'm sorry.

928
00:56:01,653 --> 00:56:03,363
Danny?

929
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:04,698
Is something wrong?

930
00:56:04,781 --> 00:56:06,867
No! Nothing's wrong.
No problem. Hi!

931
00:56:06,909 --> 00:56:09,495
It's just Danny.

932
00:56:09,578 --> 00:56:11,497
I... just... you...

933
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,665
you forgot this.

934
00:56:13,749 --> 00:56:17,878
Oh... thanks.

935
00:56:18,003 --> 00:56:19,838
It was good of you
to take the trouble...

936
00:56:19,922 --> 00:56:21,882
to drop it over... now.

937
00:56:22,007 --> 00:56:24,384
I... well, I thought
you might need it.

938
00:56:24,426 --> 00:56:27,304
You know...
maybe tomorrow morning.

939
00:56:27,387 --> 00:56:28,555
If...

940
00:56:28,597 --> 00:56:30,349
not that you wear this
to work, but...

941
00:56:30,432 --> 00:56:32,392
No... it's a hankie.

942
00:56:34,394 --> 00:56:37,648
Right, right. Yeah.

943
00:56:39,441 --> 00:56:44,321
Listen, I was thinking maybe...
I could come by some time...

944
00:56:44,404 --> 00:56:47,032
if I gave you a call,
could I come by?

945
00:56:48,826 --> 00:56:51,870
Once, maybe...
if you're not busy?

946
00:56:53,038 --> 00:56:54,206
Yeah, maybe.

947
00:56:54,289 --> 00:56:56,792
- Maybe?
- Maybe.

948
00:56:56,834 --> 00:56:58,085
OK, all right.

949
00:56:58,126 --> 00:57:00,003
Thanks.

950
00:57:00,087 --> 00:57:01,255
Good-bye. Good night.

951
00:57:01,296 --> 00:57:02,840
You are such an idiot!

952
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:09,555
Did you have fun last night?

953
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:12,057
It wasn't how it looked.

954
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,976
And if it was,
it'd be all right.

955
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:16,061
It's been months.
It's time to move on.

956
00:57:16,145 --> 00:57:17,896
I am moving on.

957
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,481
Ev, don't lie.

958
00:57:19,565 --> 00:57:22,067
All I know is, I hear you crying
when you think I'm asleep.

959
00:57:22,192 --> 00:57:24,153
When my dad left...

960
00:57:24,278 --> 00:57:26,405
I was too much
for my mom to handle...

961
00:57:26,488 --> 00:57:28,448
so she sent me
to live with my aunt.

962
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:30,492
I thought my life was over...

963
00:57:30,576 --> 00:57:33,078
But you don't know
where it's all gonna lead.

964
00:57:33,162 --> 00:57:35,414
If I hadn't run away
and lied about my age...

965
00:57:35,497 --> 00:57:36,748
and enlisted in the Navy...

966
00:57:36,832 --> 00:57:39,459
I wouldn't have met Red, and...

967
00:57:39,501 --> 00:57:41,295
now he's my fiance.

968
00:57:43,338 --> 00:57:45,591
Oh, God, I can't
get used to that word.

969
00:57:45,674 --> 00:57:47,801
- It's only been twelve hours.
- Oh, Betty!

970
00:57:47,843 --> 00:57:49,595
Little Betty
beat us all to the post.

971
00:57:49,678 --> 00:57:50,846
And this is ward three.

972
00:57:50,929 --> 00:57:53,432
As you can see, no patients.

973
00:57:53,515 --> 00:57:55,809
Welcome to Hawaii.
Come on, I'll show you the bar.

974
00:57:55,893 --> 00:57:57,978
Sandra, new recruits to torture.

975
00:57:58,061 --> 00:57:59,855
Come on. Excuse me, ladies?

976
00:57:59,938 --> 00:58:01,106
Hi!

977
00:58:02,941 --> 00:58:04,693
We're gonna wait two years
until I'm nineteen...

978
00:58:04,776 --> 00:58:06,320
and Red can buy me a ring.

979
00:58:08,447 --> 00:58:11,033
Rafe sent his best friend
to tell you...

980
00:58:11,116 --> 00:58:14,119
so you would be OK,
so you can move on.

981
00:58:15,704 --> 00:58:17,456
You gotta go on living, Ev.

982
00:58:24,546 --> 00:58:25,797
Red!

983
00:58:26,965 --> 00:58:28,884
Whoo! Sorry!

984
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:47,653
Bye, Rafe.

985
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:52,032
The Japanese Fleet is missing.

986
00:58:52,074 --> 00:58:54,952
They're operating
under radio silence.

987
00:58:55,035 --> 00:58:59,581
This footage was shot
four days ago on October 28th.

988
00:59:02,709 --> 00:59:05,587
We're sending
scout planes in wider vectors...

989
00:59:05,671 --> 00:59:08,090
all over the Pacific,
but they get nothing.

990
00:59:08,173 --> 00:59:10,384
They could be anywhere in here.

991
00:59:10,425 --> 00:59:13,554
I don't understand how
two whole carrier divisions...

992
00:59:13,595 --> 00:59:16,098
can just disappear.

993
00:59:21,687 --> 00:59:22,980
Clear!

994
00:59:32,114 --> 00:59:34,199
Aw, we're all over the page.

995
00:59:34,283 --> 00:59:36,076
We got one wall-eyed
and one pigeon-toed.

996
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,787
Anthony, tap in number six.
All right.

997
00:59:38,912 --> 00:59:40,831
Gooz, tap in number three.

998
00:59:40,914 --> 00:59:42,166
All right.

999
00:59:42,249 --> 00:59:45,210
Hey. We got a visitor.

1000
00:59:45,294 --> 00:59:48,213
Oh... that ain't
no Navy issue uniform, eh?

1001
00:59:48,297 --> 00:59:50,048
Danny, it's Evelyn.

1002
00:59:50,132 --> 00:59:51,592
Jesus!

1003
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:54,219
You alright?

1004
00:59:54,303 --> 00:59:56,221
Yeah. Yeah.

1005
00:59:56,305 --> 00:59:57,890
No.

1006
00:59:57,973 --> 01:00:00,434
I think I'm fallin' for her.

1007
01:00:00,517 --> 01:00:02,269
Wow. You know,
I saw this coming.

1008
01:00:03,729 --> 01:00:05,272
I didn't want this to happen.

1009
01:00:05,355 --> 01:00:07,357
It just kind of did.
Can't help it.

1010
01:00:07,483 --> 01:00:08,984
Well, Danny,
she's gotta be with somebody.

1011
01:00:09,109 --> 01:00:10,569
It might as well be you.

1012
01:00:10,652 --> 01:00:11,862
You telling me
if you were dead...

1013
01:00:11,987 --> 01:00:13,906
and you saw your best buddy
doin' your girl...

1014
01:00:13,989 --> 01:00:16,533
you wouldn't come back and beat
the living crap outta him?

1015
01:00:16,617 --> 01:00:19,036
- Tony, back off.
- I'd be back so fast.

1016
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:21,788
Danny's being a better friend
taking care of her himself.

1017
01:00:21,872 --> 01:00:23,790
I got a girlfriend.

1018
01:00:28,045 --> 01:00:29,421
That's great.

1019
01:00:29,505 --> 01:00:31,798
Come on, fellas.
Let's split.

1020
01:00:31,882 --> 01:00:35,135
Danny, whatever happens now
is just about you and her.

1021
01:00:35,219 --> 01:00:37,304
You gotta try
and forget about Rafe.

1022
01:00:37,346 --> 01:00:39,473
Be careful, alright?

1023
01:00:39,515 --> 01:00:42,601
Ladies... cloud the mind.

1024
01:00:42,684 --> 01:00:45,687
- Thanks, Gooz.
- You're welcome.

1025
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:48,482
Hey, Danny.

1026
01:00:51,026 --> 01:00:52,528
Where's everybody going?

1027
01:00:54,822 --> 01:00:56,698
Just bein' discreet.

1028
01:00:56,782 --> 01:00:58,659
Does it seem like everybody's
acting a little strange?

1029
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,452
No. Nah.

1030
01:01:00,536 --> 01:01:01,829
Right.

1031
01:01:04,289 --> 01:01:06,625
Well, maybe-maybe a little.
Yeah.

1032
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:08,669
Well, people in this outfit...

1033
01:01:08,752 --> 01:01:10,838
have way too much time
on their hands.

1034
01:01:10,921 --> 01:01:12,214
Oh, yeah.

1035
01:01:12,297 --> 01:01:13,507
I just hope they don't think
there's been something...

1036
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:14,883
goin' on between us,
that's all.

1037
01:01:15,008 --> 01:01:17,386
Oh, no. I mean, no.
That would be...

1038
01:01:17,469 --> 01:01:18,846
embarrassing, right?

1039
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:20,389
Forgot my wrenches.

1040
01:01:20,514 --> 01:01:21,974
That would definitely
be embarrassing.

1041
01:01:22,099 --> 01:01:23,433
Yeah.

1042
01:01:23,517 --> 01:01:25,686
Ha. Forgot my wrenches.

1043
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:28,897
Hey. He really
doesn't have to leave.

1044
01:01:28,981 --> 01:01:30,482
No.

1045
01:01:30,566 --> 01:01:34,486
I, uh, I'm just goin'
out with the girls, so...

1046
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:37,406
I guess I'll see you later.

1047
01:01:37,489 --> 01:01:39,700
- Yeah.
- All right.

1048
01:01:39,783 --> 01:01:41,535
Yeah, all right.
I'll see you around.

1049
01:01:42,953 --> 01:01:44,204
Shit.

1050
01:01:45,164 --> 01:01:47,207
Evelyn.

1051
01:01:47,332 --> 01:01:49,334
Have you ever seen
Pearl Harbor at sunset?

1052
01:01:49,459 --> 01:01:51,378
Of course.

1053
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:53,797
Well... from the air?

1054
01:01:57,759 --> 01:02:00,554
You know, I could get kicked
out of the military for this.

1055
01:02:00,637 --> 01:02:03,056
- Really?
- Yeah. Stay down.

1056
01:02:22,493 --> 01:02:24,912
The Hawaiians called
this harbor Wai Momi.

1057
01:02:24,995 --> 01:02:26,788
It means "water of pearls. "

1058
01:02:26,872 --> 01:02:28,499
It's so beautiful.

1059
01:02:28,582 --> 01:02:31,251
My dad took me up
a couple of times.

1060
01:02:31,335 --> 01:02:32,711
Just don't do what he did.

1061
01:02:32,794 --> 01:02:34,338
What do you call it
when you flip over?

1062
01:02:34,421 --> 01:02:35,547
A barrelroll?

1063
01:02:35,631 --> 01:02:36,882
Yeah.

1064
01:02:36,965 --> 01:02:39,259
I won't.

1065
01:02:39,301 --> 01:02:40,511
Aah!

1066
01:02:46,642 --> 01:02:49,645
- Oh!
- Ha ha ha ha!

1067
01:02:49,686 --> 01:02:52,439
- Oh, God.
- What do you think?

1068
01:02:52,481 --> 01:02:54,149
I like that.

1069
01:03:03,992 --> 01:03:05,327
Hey!

1070
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:07,663
That plane was supposed
to be back here an hour ago!

1071
01:03:07,746 --> 01:03:09,748
Quick, hide
in the parachute hangar.

1072
01:03:49,288 --> 01:03:51,665
My heart is pounding.

1073
01:04:39,087 --> 01:04:41,215
Danny, last night...

1074
01:04:41,298 --> 01:04:43,258
No, that's terrible.

1075
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:47,930
Danny, we need
to talk about this.

1076
01:04:49,431 --> 01:04:51,391
Sir. Evelyn!

1077
01:04:51,433 --> 01:04:53,894
- Danny.
- Hey. Hi.

1078
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:56,438
Hi.

1079
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,359
I didn't sleep a wink
last night.

1080
01:05:00,442 --> 01:05:02,903
I had to see you.

1081
01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:05,489
Last night was crazy,
I know, but...

1082
01:05:05,572 --> 01:05:07,783
I'm not sorry. Are you?

1083
01:05:09,952 --> 01:05:11,411
I don't know.

1084
01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:17,292
Danny, I had a wonderful
time last night. I-

1085
01:05:17,417 --> 01:05:18,961
It's just all too fast.

1086
01:05:19,044 --> 01:05:21,630
Listen, Evelyn, I was just down
at the beach this morning...

1087
01:05:21,713 --> 01:05:23,507
and I watched the sun rise...

1088
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:25,551
and I knew that everything
was gonna be different.

1089
01:05:25,634 --> 01:05:29,221
That this was the start
of something new.

1090
01:05:29,304 --> 01:05:32,224
In this place, in this moment.

1091
01:05:32,307 --> 01:05:35,561
And I don't care what
anybody else says, you know?

1092
01:05:35,644 --> 01:05:38,605
How can I not feel this way?

1093
01:05:40,149 --> 01:05:41,984
I kinda like you.

1094
01:05:44,862 --> 01:05:46,446
Oh, you do?

1095
01:05:51,285 --> 01:05:53,245
You have your tie on crooked.

1096
01:05:56,915 --> 01:05:59,793
Everything's
gonna be all right, OK?

1097
01:06:01,211 --> 01:06:03,255
Everything's
gonna be all right.

1098
01:06:11,972 --> 01:06:16,435
Do you have any airtours going
through the valley of Oahu?

1099
01:06:17,561 --> 01:06:19,021
You do?

1100
01:06:31,325 --> 01:06:34,328
Aloha.
This is KGMB in Honolulu...

1101
01:06:34,411 --> 01:06:37,623
on another beautiful
fall day here in paradise.

1102
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:43,879
We have enough information.

1103
01:06:45,964 --> 01:06:48,050
We are returning home.

1104
01:07:16,829 --> 01:07:17,996
Do you ever wonder...

1105
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,873
if this war's
gonna catch up with us?

1106
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:23,377
Nota whole lot.

1107
01:07:23,418 --> 01:07:27,548
Every moment we're not together,
you're up there training for it.

1108
01:07:29,508 --> 01:07:32,719
Yeah, well, I'm training
for moments like these...

1109
01:07:32,803 --> 01:07:34,388
'cause I have no idea...

1110
01:07:34,471 --> 01:07:37,015
how I'm gonna get this car
out of the sand.

1111
01:07:37,099 --> 01:07:38,559
Evelyn, can you please
come out of the bathroom?

1112
01:07:38,642 --> 01:07:40,644
You've been there for an hour.

1113
01:07:40,727 --> 01:07:43,230
Evelyn! What are you
trying to do, look like me?

1114
01:07:45,691 --> 01:07:47,568
Are you OK?

1115
01:07:47,651 --> 01:07:48,777
Yeah.

1116
01:07:48,861 --> 01:07:50,362
What's the matter?
No, you-

1117
01:07:50,445 --> 01:07:52,948
D'oy.

1118
01:07:53,031 --> 01:07:54,908
They call it the vacant sea.

1119
01:07:54,992 --> 01:07:56,952
None of the major sea lanes
go through it...

1120
01:07:57,035 --> 01:07:59,913
and you can bury the entire
land mass of Asia there...

1121
01:07:59,955 --> 01:08:01,832
and nobody would know.

1122
01:08:01,915 --> 01:08:05,043
From there,
they could attack anywhere.

1123
01:08:05,127 --> 01:08:06,587
Our last signals intercept...

1124
01:08:06,628 --> 01:08:09,339
indicate that the Japanese
taskforce is heading south...

1125
01:08:09,423 --> 01:08:11,216
towards the Philippines
or southeast Asia.

1126
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:13,594
But Captain Thurman
of Naval intelligence here...

1127
01:08:13,635 --> 01:08:15,429
has his own theory
about the missing ships.

1128
01:08:16,638 --> 01:08:19,099
Sir, I believe
they'll try to hit us...

1129
01:08:19,141 --> 01:08:21,143
where it'll hurt us the most-
Pearl Harbor.

1130
01:08:21,226 --> 01:08:24,229
It's over 4,000 nautical miles
from Japan to Pearl.

1131
01:08:24,313 --> 01:08:28,609
That's a long distance
to steam a navy, Captain.

1132
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:30,944
Your theory is based on what?

1133
01:08:30,986 --> 01:08:33,614
Well, it's what I would do.

1134
01:08:33,697 --> 01:08:36,617
That's not exactly
hard evidence, Captain Thurman.

1135
01:08:36,658 --> 01:08:38,076
Well, Admiral,
if I had hard evidence...

1136
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:39,495
we'd already be at war.

1137
01:08:39,578 --> 01:08:41,288
Sir, we can read
their diplomatic codes...

1138
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:42,623
faster than they can type them.

1139
01:08:42,706 --> 01:08:44,291
But Captain Thurman's
cryptology team...

1140
01:08:44,374 --> 01:08:46,126
is still trying
to crack the naval codes.

1141
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:49,087
The intercepts have missing
words and garbled lines...

1142
01:08:49,171 --> 01:08:52,883
so to explain the decrypts,
we have to try to interpret...

1143
01:08:53,008 --> 01:08:54,051
what we think
they're trying to do.

1144
01:08:54,176 --> 01:08:57,304
Interpret?
You mean guess.

1145
01:08:57,346 --> 01:08:59,848
They use
their informed intuition, sir.

1146
01:08:59,932 --> 01:09:02,309
We guess.

1147
01:09:02,351 --> 01:09:03,811
It's like playing chess
in the dark.

1148
01:09:03,852 --> 01:09:06,480
Any rumor, troop movement,
ship movement...

1149
01:09:06,563 --> 01:09:08,816
spine-tingle, goose bump,
we pay attention to it.

1150
01:09:08,899 --> 01:09:10,818
When I was in
the Asiatic Fleet...

1151
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:13,028
the locals used to try
to get outside of a problem...

1152
01:09:13,111 --> 01:09:14,488
to try to see the inside.

1153
01:09:14,571 --> 01:09:16,114
Well, I see a strike on Pearl.

1154
01:09:16,198 --> 01:09:17,783
It's the worst thing
that could happen.

1155
01:09:17,866 --> 01:09:18,992
A blow to Pearl
would devastate...

1156
01:09:19,034 --> 01:09:21,370
the Pacific Fleet's
ability to make war.

1157
01:09:21,495 --> 01:09:24,706
So, sir, you would have us
mobilize the entire fleet...

1158
01:09:24,832 --> 01:09:27,793
at the cost
of millions of dollars...

1159
01:09:27,876 --> 01:09:30,254
based on this spine-tingling
feeling of yours?

1160
01:09:30,337 --> 01:09:34,174
No, sir. My job is to gather
and interpret material.

1161
01:09:34,258 --> 01:09:36,426
Making difficult decisions...

1162
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:37,970
based on
incomplete information...

1163
01:09:38,053 --> 01:09:40,848
from my limited
decoding ability...

1164
01:09:40,889 --> 01:09:43,350
is your job, sir.

1165
01:09:43,392 --> 01:09:45,811
Then break the damn naval code,
Captain...

1166
01:09:45,894 --> 01:09:47,646
so I can make a better decision.

1167
01:09:47,729 --> 01:09:50,691
Aye, sir. We are trying.

1168
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:10,627
I wonder if we shouldn't put
the Pacific Fleet on full alert.

1169
01:10:17,009 --> 01:10:18,135
In case the optimism...

1170
01:10:18,218 --> 01:10:21,096
of the "Honolulu Advertiser"
proves unfounded, gentlemen...

1171
01:10:22,181 --> 01:10:23,432
what are General Short
and the Army...

1172
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:25,267
going to do
about protecting my ships?

1173
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:27,811
Within a ten-mile radius
of your harbor...

1174
01:10:27,936 --> 01:10:29,771
we have fighterplanes
here at Wheeler...

1175
01:10:29,897 --> 01:10:32,107
bombers at Hickam, and
a trainingstrip at Haleiwa.

1176
01:10:42,493 --> 01:10:43,952
We've recently established
a radar station here...

1177
01:10:44,036 --> 01:10:47,080
that can detect planes
125 miles out.

1178
01:10:47,164 --> 01:10:49,416
Which is a month old, Admiral,
and untested.

1179
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:52,252
I've seen
these new radar screens, Major.

1180
01:10:52,294 --> 01:10:53,879
There's no way of telling
whether they're ours, theirs...

1181
01:10:53,962 --> 01:10:55,631
or a flock of damn birds.

1182
01:10:57,883 --> 01:10:59,468
I'm intercepting
a call from Tokyo...

1183
01:10:59,551 --> 01:11:01,595
to somewhere close by Pearl.

1184
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,096
There's a call from Tokyo.

1185
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:04,473
They say they don't know you.

1186
01:11:06,642 --> 01:11:08,769
Hello? Hai.

1187
01:11:15,234 --> 01:11:16,902
It's a local dentist.

1188
01:11:16,985 --> 01:11:19,696
He can see Pearl Harbor
from his office.

1189
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:21,782
Are there many sailors around?

1190
01:11:26,829 --> 01:11:29,289
Uh, the dentist
says that the flatships...

1191
01:11:29,331 --> 01:11:31,083
are not in port.

1192
01:11:31,166 --> 01:11:33,836
They're talking about
the weather.

1193
01:11:33,919 --> 01:11:36,088
He doesn't seem to know
who he's talking to.

1194
01:11:36,171 --> 01:11:37,840
Hello?

1195
01:11:37,965 --> 01:11:40,092
Hello? Moshi moshi.

1196
01:11:40,175 --> 01:11:41,885
Hello?

1197
01:11:41,969 --> 01:11:44,304
That was a strange call.

1198
01:11:46,598 --> 01:11:48,308
Admiral,
may I speak to you in private?

1199
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:51,353
Why would a spy use a phone?

1200
01:11:51,436 --> 01:11:53,063
They know we tap
all international lines.

1201
01:11:53,147 --> 01:11:55,315
Our listeners feel
it's probably not code talk.

1202
01:11:55,399 --> 01:11:57,067
It sounds like someone in Japan
is sneaking around...

1203
01:11:57,151 --> 01:11:59,278
asking a local citizen
the location of our carriers.

1204
01:11:59,361 --> 01:12:01,655
Well, that makes me feel
all warm inside.

1205
01:12:01,738 --> 01:12:04,533
Get the FBI on it immediately.

1206
01:12:04,616 --> 01:12:06,869
Have we found
the goddamn Japanese Fleet yet?

1207
01:12:06,952 --> 01:12:09,454
No, Admiral. The bases are
looking all over the Pacific.

1208
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:11,498
So the entire fleet could be
rounding Diamond Head...

1209
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:13,542
and we wouldn't know
a thing about it.

1210
01:12:13,667 --> 01:12:14,793
Get on it.

1211
01:12:49,328 --> 01:12:51,288
I'm alive.

1212
01:12:51,413 --> 01:12:53,540
This is the first
I could get word out.

1213
01:13:30,577 --> 01:13:33,163
Jepense qu'il est mort!

1214
01:13:34,456 --> 01:13:36,458
ll estencore en vie.

1215
01:13:53,642 --> 01:13:55,686
I told you I'd come back.

1216
01:13:59,189 --> 01:14:01,316
Here, sit down.
Sit down. Come here.

1217
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,902
It's OK.

1218
01:14:03,986 --> 01:14:05,946
It's all right.

1219
01:14:08,615 --> 01:14:09,950
You're real.

1220
01:14:10,033 --> 01:14:11,827
Yeah.

1221
01:14:13,328 --> 01:14:14,955
I wished for this every day.

1222
01:14:14,997 --> 01:14:16,290
I know. Me, too.

1223
01:14:16,373 --> 01:14:18,959
Every second. So did I.

1224
01:14:19,042 --> 01:14:21,253
I thought you were dead.

1225
01:14:21,336 --> 01:14:23,130
They said you were shot down
in the sea.

1226
01:14:23,255 --> 01:14:25,340
Yeah, I was.

1227
01:14:25,465 --> 01:14:28,385
I was in the ocean.
It was so cold.

1228
01:14:28,468 --> 01:14:30,679
I missed you.

1229
01:14:30,762 --> 01:14:33,849
I got picked up
by a French fishing boat...

1230
01:14:33,932 --> 01:14:36,894
and I was in occupied France,
and I couldn't get word out.

1231
01:14:36,977 --> 01:14:39,313
And I'm just-I'll tell you
all about it, I promise.

1232
01:14:39,354 --> 01:14:41,148
But I'm fine. I'm OK.

1233
01:14:41,231 --> 01:14:42,733
And I'm here now.

1234
01:14:42,816 --> 01:14:44,067
Evelyn...

1235
01:14:44,151 --> 01:14:46,278
I just wanted to see you.

1236
01:14:46,361 --> 01:14:49,198
You're so beautiful.

1237
01:15:04,588 --> 01:15:06,256
I love you.

1238
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:13,347
Hey, it's OK. It's OK.

1239
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:15,224
Evelyn, Evelyn. I'm back.

1240
01:15:16,558 --> 01:15:19,853
It's OK. I won't leave you
again, I promise.

1241
01:15:21,063 --> 01:15:22,523
Rafe, you died.

1242
01:15:25,692 --> 01:15:27,402
And so did I.

1243
01:15:27,486 --> 01:15:31,448
I know, but I'm-I'm-
It's fine now. I'm back.

1244
01:15:32,574 --> 01:15:33,742
We're together.

1245
01:15:40,666 --> 01:15:43,043
I mean, we are together...

1246
01:15:43,126 --> 01:15:44,378
right?

1247
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:49,216
I don't know where I am.

1248
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:54,388
Rafe.

1249
01:16:22,958 --> 01:16:24,251
Rafe.

1250
01:16:28,172 --> 01:16:29,965
Stay away.

1251
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:34,136
Rafe.

1252
01:16:36,889 --> 01:16:38,849
This is Radio Honolulu...

1253
01:16:38,974 --> 01:16:40,267
playing the sweetest music...

1254
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:43,228
on the sweetest island
in the Pacific.

1255
01:16:43,312 --> 01:16:45,397
It's a beautiful
December 6th...

1256
01:16:45,481 --> 01:16:47,274
with beautiful music...

1257
01:16:58,952 --> 01:17:00,370
Raaaaafe!

1258
01:17:00,454 --> 01:17:02,498
Oh, Goddamnit.
There you go.

1259
01:17:02,581 --> 01:17:04,666
A real live ace!

1260
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:05,959
Whoo!

1261
01:17:06,001 --> 01:17:08,629
An ace is only five.
I shot down six M.E.s.

1262
01:17:08,754 --> 01:17:11,340
And I got two smokers, too.
They don't count them.

1263
01:17:11,465 --> 01:17:13,884
Of course, I got shot down
myself before they could pin me.

1264
01:17:13,967 --> 01:17:15,928
So you got back
from behind enemy lines, huh?

1265
01:17:15,969 --> 01:17:18,222
What's that combat like?
Were you scared?

1266
01:17:18,305 --> 01:17:21,517
Hey! One at a time.

1267
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,602
Well, them Luftwaffe boys
can fly pretty good.

1268
01:17:23,685 --> 01:17:25,270
It's not like,
you know, training.

1269
01:17:25,354 --> 01:17:26,480
They're, uh...

1270
01:17:30,567 --> 01:17:31,985
Danny.

1271
01:17:32,069 --> 01:17:33,862
You know, they're all about
tactics is what it is.

1272
01:17:33,946 --> 01:17:35,823
See, the Nazis, right,
they're faster than you are...

1273
01:17:35,906 --> 01:17:37,783
so they'll disappear and
they get up in the soup...

1274
01:17:37,825 --> 01:17:39,284
and they'll throw like
a roll or a hammerhead...

1275
01:17:39,368 --> 01:17:41,578
and they'll come around
on your high side...

1276
01:17:41,662 --> 01:17:44,623
shoot you from behind-
like some Americans will.

1277
01:17:49,795 --> 01:17:51,672
Hey...

1278
01:17:51,713 --> 01:17:54,174
Gooz, you're lookin'
at a real live ace.

1279
01:17:54,258 --> 01:17:56,593
Well, let me give you
the shirt off my back!

1280
01:17:56,677 --> 01:17:58,303
Whoo!

1281
01:17:58,387 --> 01:17:59,847
Aloha! There you go!

1282
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:01,306
I'll take it from you.

1283
01:18:01,390 --> 01:18:03,350
I can see how y'all been
spending your time out here.

1284
01:18:03,433 --> 01:18:04,852
Hey, Rafe,
we gotta talk, all right?

1285
01:18:04,893 --> 01:18:07,771
I got nothin' to talk
about with you. Here.

1286
01:18:09,398 --> 01:18:11,942
Why don't you have a drink?

1287
01:18:12,025 --> 01:18:13,861
I'll make a toast.

1288
01:18:13,902 --> 01:18:16,196
To returning from the dead.

1289
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:20,117
Wasn't all I expected,
but, well, that's life.

1290
01:18:21,493 --> 01:18:23,829
To my best friend
and loyal buddy Danny...

1291
01:18:23,871 --> 01:18:26,665
for keepin' up the war effort
back here at home.

1292
01:18:30,335 --> 01:18:31,461
Ahh.

1293
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:34,506
You know, where I come from...

1294
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:36,091
somebody makes a toast to you
and you don't drink...

1295
01:18:36,175 --> 01:18:37,634
that's sayin' something.

1296
01:18:37,718 --> 01:18:40,679
All right, Rafe.

1297
01:18:40,762 --> 01:18:43,348
That's how it's gonna be.

1298
01:18:43,432 --> 01:18:44,933
To you.

1299
01:18:45,017 --> 01:18:46,393
Hey, you guys need to spend
some time alone, I think.

1300
01:18:46,477 --> 01:18:48,520
Aw, hell, no, Red.
Come on.

1301
01:18:48,604 --> 01:18:51,148
No, no, no.
We're celebratin' here.

1302
01:18:51,273 --> 01:18:53,275
Me over there fightin'...

1303
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,360
almost gettin' killed...

1304
01:18:55,486 --> 01:18:57,279
my friend Danny back here...

1305
01:18:57,362 --> 01:18:59,490
lookin' after my interests
for me.

1306
01:18:59,573 --> 01:19:00,657
Y'all know Danny
was even good enough...

1307
01:19:00,741 --> 01:19:03,202
to look out for my girl for me
while I was gone?

1308
01:19:03,285 --> 01:19:06,038
We thought you were dead, Rafe.
And it gutted us both.

1309
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:08,790
And we were just tryin'
to get on with our lives.

1310
01:19:08,874 --> 01:19:10,417
Life is good, ain't it, Danny?

1311
01:19:10,501 --> 01:19:12,628
You know, you're a rotten drunk.
You always have been.

1312
01:19:12,711 --> 01:19:15,839
Well, you're a lousy friend.
That's a new development.

1313
01:19:17,633 --> 01:19:20,177
You left her to fight
somebody else's war...

1314
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:21,929
and you made damn sure
that I didn't go with you...

1315
01:19:21,970 --> 01:19:23,472
and we thought
that you were dead-

1316
01:19:23,555 --> 01:19:25,641
I almost did die,
you little son of a bitch!

1317
01:19:25,766 --> 01:19:28,143
And her face was the last thing
that went through my mind...

1318
01:19:28,227 --> 01:19:30,187
so don't stand there and tell
me to act like it's all right!

1319
01:19:30,270 --> 01:19:32,439
Yeah, Rafe, well, I stayed.

1320
01:19:32,481 --> 01:19:34,441
I stayed,
and you made sure of that...

1321
01:19:34,483 --> 01:19:35,692
and some things changed.

1322
01:19:35,776 --> 01:19:37,611
And I hope
you can get used to that.

1323
01:19:37,653 --> 01:19:39,571
Oh, I have to get used to it?

1324
01:19:39,655 --> 01:19:43,116
All right. We'll see
how I can get used to it.

1325
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:44,952
- Whoa!
- Hey!

1326
01:19:45,035 --> 01:19:46,328
Get used to that, boy!

1327
01:19:46,411 --> 01:19:47,913
Hey, hey!

1328
01:19:47,996 --> 01:19:49,164
And that's my left hand, too!

1329
01:19:49,248 --> 01:19:51,250
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, come on!

1330
01:19:56,296 --> 01:19:59,299
Melee at the Hula-la.
Send M.P.s!

1331
01:19:59,383 --> 01:20:00,759
- Aah!
- Aah!

1332
01:20:02,261 --> 01:20:04,972
- You called me a lousy friend?
- Get your hands off!

1333
01:20:05,013 --> 01:20:06,140
Aah!

1334
01:20:07,724 --> 01:20:08,851
Ow! Shit!

1335
01:20:10,811 --> 01:20:12,229
Come on, Danny!

1336
01:20:17,776 --> 01:20:19,111
Let's go get 'em.

1337
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,655
Let's move out!

1338
01:20:23,699 --> 01:20:26,034
Oh, no. They're gonna
throw us in the brig.

1339
01:20:26,118 --> 01:20:27,494
Let's get outta here.

1340
01:21:13,415 --> 01:21:15,209
Oh, shit.

1341
01:21:17,461 --> 01:21:19,213
Rafe...

1342
01:21:19,296 --> 01:21:21,215
you're the only family I got.

1343
01:21:21,298 --> 01:21:23,634
When you were gone...

1344
01:21:23,717 --> 01:21:25,886
it was the loneliest
I'd ever been.

1345
01:21:25,969 --> 01:21:28,013
The same for her, too.

1346
01:21:28,096 --> 01:21:30,557
Oh, boy, now you're really
breakin' my heart.

1347
01:21:30,641 --> 01:21:32,810
If you hadn't gone,
none of this woulda happened.

1348
01:21:32,893 --> 01:21:34,645
Oh, so it's my fault, I guess.

1349
01:21:35,979 --> 01:21:37,272
Damn it, Rafe.

1350
01:21:41,652 --> 01:21:45,072
I just know
there's got to be some way...

1351
01:21:45,155 --> 01:21:48,534
we can work things out
so that...

1352
01:21:48,617 --> 01:21:50,452
things could be right
between me and you.

1353
01:21:51,537 --> 01:21:54,122
I just don't see how
it could ever be the same.

1354
01:22:02,714 --> 01:22:04,007
Revered father...

1355
01:22:08,178 --> 01:22:11,390
I go now to fulfill my mission
and my destiny.

1356
01:22:13,016 --> 01:22:14,560
I hope it is a destiny...

1357
01:22:14,643 --> 01:22:16,895
that will bring honor
to our family...

1358
01:22:16,979 --> 01:22:19,439
and if it requires my life...

1359
01:22:19,481 --> 01:22:21,233
I will sacrifice it gladly...

1360
01:22:21,275 --> 01:22:23,610
to be a good servant
of our nation.

1361
01:23:44,817 --> 01:23:46,819
Hey...

1362
01:23:46,902 --> 01:23:48,362
we got a large haze.

1363
01:23:51,323 --> 01:23:53,242
That's too big
to be planes, right?

1364
01:23:57,704 --> 01:23:59,998
Is that what you wanna do?
Knight to knight five?

1365
01:24:00,082 --> 01:24:01,667
Boom! Wrong move.

1366
01:24:01,708 --> 01:24:03,585
Lieutenant,
radar's picking up...

1367
01:24:03,669 --> 01:24:05,629
a large return
moving in from the northeast.

1368
01:24:05,712 --> 01:24:07,548
Hang on.

1369
01:24:07,589 --> 01:24:09,133
Relax.

1370
01:24:09,216 --> 01:24:11,593
It's a flight of B-17s
coming in from the mainland.

1371
01:24:13,512 --> 01:24:15,264
Nothing to worry about.

1372
01:24:15,347 --> 01:24:16,890
A heck of a lot of B-17s.

1373
01:24:19,226 --> 01:24:20,894
Good shot, Hop.

1374
01:24:23,939 --> 01:24:26,024
This better be good, Commander.

1375
01:24:27,568 --> 01:24:29,695
One of our destroyers reports
having fired and sunk...

1376
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:33,824
enemy submarine attempting
to enter Pearl Harbor at 0653.

1377
01:24:33,907 --> 01:24:34,992
It's 7:20!

1378
01:24:35,075 --> 01:24:36,451
We had decoder delays, Admiral.

1379
01:24:36,577 --> 01:24:38,203
Relay this to Washington.
Recall the staff.

1380
01:24:42,332 --> 01:24:44,042
"Failure...

1381
01:24:44,126 --> 01:24:45,669
"'Peace talks...

1382
01:24:45,752 --> 01:24:47,212
"useless. "

1383
01:24:49,423 --> 01:24:51,758
Thurman here.
Tokyo transmitting...

1384
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:53,343
to their embassy
in Washington-

1385
01:24:53,427 --> 01:24:55,387
"Discontinue use
of your decoding machine...

1386
01:24:55,471 --> 01:24:56,930
"and dispose of immediately.

1387
01:24:57,014 --> 01:24:59,057
"Special emphasis
on destroying important parts. "

1388
01:24:59,141 --> 01:25:00,559
Do you read that?
Acknowledge.

1389
01:25:07,858 --> 01:25:09,109
Admiral...

1390
01:25:09,193 --> 01:25:10,611
Naval Intel intercepted
a transmission from Tokyo...

1391
01:25:10,694 --> 01:25:12,488
to the Japanese embassy
in Washington...

1392
01:25:12,571 --> 01:25:15,199
instructing them to break apart
all decoder machines...

1393
01:25:15,282 --> 01:25:17,284
and burn all secret documents.

1394
01:25:17,367 --> 01:25:20,287
The Japanese
are expecting a war.

1395
01:25:20,329 --> 01:25:22,331
Should we?

1396
01:26:09,002 --> 01:26:10,295
Warning of possible...

1397
01:26:10,337 --> 01:26:13,048
Japanese aggressive movement
in any direction.

1398
01:26:13,132 --> 01:26:15,676
"Broken relationship.
Hostilities imminent. "

1399
01:26:15,759 --> 01:26:17,511
But where?

1400
01:26:56,383 --> 01:26:58,427
Did you ever lose a fight,
Miller?

1401
01:27:00,262 --> 01:27:02,556
I been lucky so far, Captain.

1402
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:04,224
From what I hear, it ain't luck.

1403
01:27:05,934 --> 01:27:07,895
Ship's proud of you, son.

1404
01:27:19,198 --> 01:27:21,992
Ha ha ha. Yeah! Ha ha!

1405
01:27:42,095 --> 01:27:44,097
Why the hell's the Navy...

1406
01:27:44,139 --> 01:27:46,725
doing practice this early
on a Sunday?

1407
01:28:40,904 --> 01:28:42,030
- Aah!
- Get down!

1408
01:28:49,371 --> 01:28:51,206
Go, go, go, go!

1409
01:28:52,958 --> 01:28:55,085
I'm with Navy newsreel,
and I can tell you one thing-

1410
01:28:55,169 --> 01:28:56,753
them ain't Navy planes!

1411
01:29:01,091 --> 01:29:02,634
All hands,
man your battle stations!

1412
01:29:02,718 --> 01:29:04,178
We're being bombed!
We're being bombed!

1413
01:29:04,261 --> 01:29:05,387
Get up! Get up!

1414
01:29:17,524 --> 01:29:19,735
Jesus Christ!

1415
01:29:29,161 --> 01:29:30,204
Man your battle stations.

1416
01:29:30,329 --> 01:29:32,164
Another dumb drill.

1417
01:29:48,889 --> 01:29:50,432
All hands,
man your battle stations.

1418
01:29:50,516 --> 01:29:52,726
- What the heck was that?
- It's a bomb!

1419
01:29:55,187 --> 01:29:57,397
Move, move, move!

1420
01:30:01,235 --> 01:30:02,528
Son of a bi-

1421
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:10,661
From outside!

1422
01:30:10,744 --> 01:30:12,913
Get me the engine room!

1423
01:30:15,082 --> 01:30:16,750
My God.

1424
01:30:16,834 --> 01:30:18,961
Take cover!

1425
01:30:19,044 --> 01:30:21,547
Down! Down!

1426
01:30:21,630 --> 01:30:24,716
Report battle stations!
Manned and ready!

1427
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,301
Man your battle stations!

1428
01:30:26,385 --> 01:30:28,053
This is no shit!

1429
01:30:28,095 --> 01:30:29,596
They just sunk the Arizona!

1430
01:30:29,721 --> 01:30:31,056
General quarters!
General quarters!

1431
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:33,100
All hands,
man your battle stations!

1432
01:30:33,142 --> 01:30:34,601
This is no damn drill!

1433
01:30:36,103 --> 01:30:38,730
Go! Go!

1434
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:42,609
They look like Japs.

1435
01:30:42,693 --> 01:30:45,320
I didn't even know
the Japs were sore at us!

1436
01:30:45,404 --> 01:30:47,364
Danny, you just get me
to a goddamn airplane!

1437
01:30:50,742 --> 01:30:51,869
Holy God!

1438
01:30:51,952 --> 01:30:54,329
This is good
footage. Did you see that?

1439
01:30:54,413 --> 01:30:55,706
Holy cow!

1440
01:30:55,789 --> 01:30:57,666
I hope
there's still an airfield left.

1441
01:31:37,164 --> 01:31:39,625
Hurry up!
What in the world?

1442
01:31:41,919 --> 01:31:43,420
Look! So many!

1443
01:31:53,032 --> 01:31:55,868
Everybody to the hospital!

1444
01:32:08,464 --> 01:32:10,341
Why's the Navy
always buzzin' us?

1445
01:32:11,759 --> 01:32:13,636
shut up, Red!

1446
01:32:15,346 --> 01:32:18,224
- Oh, man, come on.
- Red, it's too early.

1447
01:32:18,265 --> 01:32:20,184
The Japs are here!

1448
01:32:22,061 --> 01:32:24,188
What the hell?
Let's go! Let's go!

1449
01:32:59,682 --> 01:33:02,226
- Get corpsmen to the bridge.
- Aye, Captain!

1450
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:12,820
Repair says third deck
is flooding port side!

1451
01:33:16,115 --> 01:33:18,534
Yaah! Uhh!

1452
01:33:31,714 --> 01:33:33,132
Get up!

1453
01:33:33,215 --> 01:33:35,301
Get up, you cowards!
Get up there and fight!

1454
01:33:35,426 --> 01:33:36,552
Move it!

1455
01:33:40,556 --> 01:33:42,141
Take cover!

1456
01:33:49,857 --> 01:33:51,150
I got you, Captain.

1457
01:33:51,233 --> 01:33:52,610
You radio for air cover!

1458
01:33:52,735 --> 01:33:55,196
Initiate damage control!

1459
01:33:55,237 --> 01:33:58,240
Find my X.O.
Tell him to assume command.

1460
01:33:58,275 --> 01:33:59,492
And you make sure the gunners-

1461
01:33:59,533 --> 01:34:02,036
Everyone's where
they need to be, Captain.

1462
01:34:02,071 --> 01:34:06,457
You trained us well.

1463
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:09,168
Captain...

1464
01:34:12,630 --> 01:34:14,173
Aah!

1465
01:34:42,076 --> 01:34:44,078
Go, go, go, go!

1466
01:34:44,203 --> 01:34:47,248
Let's go! Let's go!
Everybody move!

1467
01:34:49,208 --> 01:34:52,086
Get the ammo
for that fifty cal!

1468
01:34:52,211 --> 01:34:54,380
Get that fifty cal!

1469
01:35:00,219 --> 01:35:01,220
Let's go! We gotta get-

1470
01:35:05,516 --> 01:35:07,893
Come on, man, we gotta
get this thing loaded up!

1471
01:35:18,904 --> 01:35:20,906
- Aah!
- Aah!

1472
01:35:23,701 --> 01:35:25,536
Let's go! Let's go!

1473
01:35:28,122 --> 01:35:29,999
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

1474
01:36:03,199 --> 01:36:05,618
Danny,
get me into a damn plane!

1475
01:36:05,785 --> 01:36:07,787
Come on!

1476
01:36:17,797 --> 01:36:20,925
Get some ammo up here!
We need some men on these guns!

1477
01:36:21,092 --> 01:36:23,928
Sir! The captain says
you're in charge, sir!

1478
01:36:23,969 --> 01:36:26,388
We need more ammo! Now!

1479
01:36:26,514 --> 01:36:29,391
Send up ammunition
for the five-inch guns!

1480
01:36:31,811 --> 01:36:33,229
Medic!

1481
01:36:33,270 --> 01:36:34,396
All of 'em, now!

1482
01:36:34,522 --> 01:36:35,564
Aah!

1483
01:36:36,649 --> 01:36:38,359
Aah!

1484
01:36:55,126 --> 01:36:58,587
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1485
01:37:01,549 --> 01:37:03,134
Come on!

1486
01:37:03,217 --> 01:37:06,011
Aah! Come on!

1487
01:37:06,137 --> 01:37:08,514
Come on, you sum 'bitch!

1488
01:37:09,682 --> 01:37:12,560
Aah!

1489
01:37:15,271 --> 01:37:16,710
Aah ha!

1490
01:37:16,745 --> 01:37:18,114
Oh, yeah!

1491
01:37:18,149 --> 01:37:21,152
I need a doctor!
Somebody help me!

1492
01:37:24,530 --> 01:37:27,408
Get to the supply room!

1493
01:37:27,443 --> 01:37:30,286
Get everything out!

1494
01:37:35,875 --> 01:37:38,169
- Aah!
- Planes incoming!

1495
01:37:41,756 --> 01:37:43,591
Cut 'em down!

1496
01:37:43,758 --> 01:37:46,635
Come on, come on!
Get 'em away from the windows!

1497
01:37:53,058 --> 01:37:55,478
The mattresses!
Get 'em against the wall!

1498
01:37:59,190 --> 01:38:01,233
Take cover!

1499
01:38:08,657 --> 01:38:10,868
Is everybody all right?

1500
01:38:10,910 --> 01:38:13,204
Can you stand? Can you stand?

1501
01:38:14,955 --> 01:38:16,207
Hold your fire!

1502
01:38:16,332 --> 01:38:17,917
Get to the gun! Hurry up!

1503
01:38:19,919 --> 01:38:21,378
Get down, Danny!

1504
01:38:24,924 --> 01:38:26,509
Aah!

1505
01:38:30,513 --> 01:38:32,681
- Earl!
- This is Walker!

1506
01:38:32,807 --> 01:38:35,184
We need to get those planes
fueled and loaded right now!

1507
01:38:35,226 --> 01:38:37,228
What's going on
out there? Huh?

1508
01:38:37,394 --> 01:38:38,813
Danny,
what the hell's that noise?

1509
01:38:38,896 --> 01:38:40,523
You guys doin' target practice
or something?

1510
01:38:40,558 --> 01:38:42,233
I think World War II
just started.

1511
01:38:50,699 --> 01:38:53,119
Go, go, go!

1512
01:39:00,584 --> 01:39:02,294
- Billy!
- Run!

1513
01:39:02,420 --> 01:39:05,548
- It's gonna blow!
- It's a dud.

1514
01:39:05,714 --> 01:39:07,591
It's a dud!

1515
01:39:17,268 --> 01:39:18,436
Come on, get down!

1516
01:39:18,561 --> 01:39:20,980
Danny!
Danny, are you all right?

1517
01:39:21,021 --> 01:39:22,148
I'm all right!

1518
01:39:22,231 --> 01:39:23,858
Come on, let's go!
Come on, let's go!

1519
01:39:23,983 --> 01:39:26,152
Gooz, come on, man!

1520
01:39:49,884 --> 01:39:53,220
We're sinking! We're sinking!

1521
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:04,315
Stay together!
Close the hatches!

1522
01:40:18,496 --> 01:40:20,498
- I can't swim!
- Just hang on!

1523
01:40:33,511 --> 01:40:35,971
Let's move it now!

1524
01:40:36,097 --> 01:40:37,681
Joe! Go! Go!

1525
01:40:37,807 --> 01:40:39,809
We're gettin' outta here!
Get in the car!

1526
01:40:39,934 --> 01:40:41,227
Get in! Get in!

1527
01:40:41,268 --> 01:40:42,645
Come on, let's go! Go!

1528
01:40:42,686 --> 01:40:44,688
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

1529
01:40:44,814 --> 01:40:47,358
Come on!

1530
01:40:47,399 --> 01:40:48,692
Where's this place we're goin'?

1531
01:40:48,818 --> 01:40:51,237
We got a small mechanic runway
about ten minutes away.

1532
01:40:51,278 --> 01:40:52,988
Hasn't been hit yet.

1533
01:40:58,536 --> 01:41:00,287
We got Zeros on our six!

1534
01:41:05,543 --> 01:41:06,836
Duck!

1535
01:41:33,446 --> 01:41:35,281
Help us!

1536
01:41:38,576 --> 01:41:39,744
Aah!

1537
01:42:01,766 --> 01:42:03,058
We're trapped.

1538
01:42:05,060 --> 01:42:07,188
Try it! Try the door!

1539
01:42:19,950 --> 01:42:21,619
Aah!

1540
01:42:34,340 --> 01:42:36,634
Oh, my God! I'm going under!

1541
01:42:41,972 --> 01:42:43,349
It's sucking me back!

1542
01:42:44,350 --> 01:42:46,811
The current's too strong!

1543
01:43:00,699 --> 01:43:01,826
They're shootin' at us!

1544
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,128
I don't wanna die!
I don't wanna die!

1545
01:43:42,324 --> 01:43:44,160
This is it.

1546
01:43:44,201 --> 01:43:45,745
Get us out of here now!

1547
01:44:09,643 --> 01:44:11,479
How bad?

1548
01:44:11,604 --> 01:44:13,856
It's still not over, sir.

1549
01:44:17,777 --> 01:44:21,864
An entire fleet at anchor.

1550
01:44:21,906 --> 01:44:24,909
My God, my God...

1551
01:44:47,807 --> 01:44:50,643
Barbara, fill every syringe
you can find with morphine!

1552
01:44:53,813 --> 01:44:56,190
Fill up the kitchen!
Are you listening to me?

1553
01:44:56,232 --> 01:44:57,650
Fill up the kitchen!

1554
01:45:05,533 --> 01:45:08,411
Over there! Over there!

1555
01:45:14,959 --> 01:45:16,836
We got a bad neckwound here!

1556
01:45:16,961 --> 01:45:18,879
Surgery! Move!

1557
01:45:18,963 --> 01:45:21,549
Get him to surgery!
Oh, God.

1558
01:45:21,674 --> 01:45:23,259
In here!

1559
01:45:23,426 --> 01:45:26,220
He's still bleeding!
Another hemostat!

1560
01:45:26,262 --> 01:45:28,681
Hurry!
Give me a hemostat now!

1561
01:45:31,517 --> 01:45:33,310
Damn it, hurry!

1562
01:45:35,438 --> 01:45:39,275
Gimme another hemostat!
Another suture! Hurry!

1563
01:45:39,316 --> 01:45:42,445
Give me a-
Oh, God, I'm so sorry!

1564
01:45:47,450 --> 01:45:48,993
Doctor!

1565
01:45:49,034 --> 01:45:51,454
Here! Aah!

1566
01:45:58,335 --> 01:46:00,921
Am I gonna die?

1567
01:46:01,046 --> 01:46:02,590
Nurse!

1568
01:46:07,928 --> 01:46:09,472
Don't leave me!

1569
01:46:09,555 --> 01:46:12,183
Doctor! Get over here!

1570
01:46:14,351 --> 01:46:15,603
My fingers
are plugging his artery!

1571
01:46:16,896 --> 01:46:18,481
Doctor, what do you need?

1572
01:46:20,066 --> 01:46:22,359
Focus, look at me.
What do you need?

1573
01:46:22,485 --> 01:46:24,904
- Hemostat.
- Hemostat.

1574
01:46:27,323 --> 01:46:30,785
Here. All right, look at me.
You're going to be all right.

1575
01:46:30,820 --> 01:46:32,661
You're going to be all right.

1576
01:46:41,504 --> 01:46:42,887
I need more ammo!

1577
01:46:42,922 --> 01:46:45,216
I need more ammo, ladies!

1578
01:46:45,251 --> 01:46:47,510
I need more ammo!

1579
01:46:47,551 --> 01:46:50,179
Earl! We good to go?

1580
01:46:50,221 --> 01:46:51,889
- Mostly, but-
- Get down!

1581
01:46:51,972 --> 01:46:53,974
- Shit! Get cover!
- Jesus!

1582
01:46:57,103 --> 01:46:59,522
- Come on, you guys!
- Earl, get in here!

1583
01:47:02,525 --> 01:47:05,236
Sergeant!
We need more than a shotgun!

1584
01:47:05,271 --> 01:47:07,947
You got any other weapons
for coverfire?

1585
01:47:07,982 --> 01:47:09,573
Inside that ammo locker!

1586
01:47:09,698 --> 01:47:11,951
- Come on!
- Move it!

1587
01:47:13,828 --> 01:47:16,288
- Go! Go!
- Get the guns out!

1588
01:47:16,414 --> 01:47:18,249
You said the planes
are mostly ready, but...

1589
01:47:18,290 --> 01:47:19,708
but what?

1590
01:47:19,834 --> 01:47:20,876
She's down, she's broke,
she's shit.

1591
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:22,294
I got four left.

1592
01:47:22,420 --> 01:47:24,839
One's good, two need ammo,
one needs fuel.

1593
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:26,966
Fall out
and load up in the bunker!

1594
01:47:27,133 --> 01:47:28,426
Let's go! Get down!

1595
01:47:28,551 --> 01:47:31,429
- Move!
- Get ready to roll this thing!

1596
01:47:31,464 --> 01:47:34,105
Get down! Now!

1597
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:38,227
Anthony, Red, you stay here
and man the fifty-caliber.

1598
01:47:38,262 --> 01:47:42,314
Gooz, get to the next bunker
and lay down some coverfire.

1599
01:47:42,440 --> 01:47:43,566
Planes.

1600
01:47:45,860 --> 01:47:48,154
Should we fire?

1601
01:47:48,195 --> 01:47:50,573
Stay down! God damn it!
Hold your fire!

1602
01:47:50,614 --> 01:47:52,324
Stay still! Nobody fire!

1603
01:47:52,359 --> 01:47:54,034
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

1604
01:47:57,621 --> 01:47:59,290
They don't know we're here.

1605
01:48:00,166 --> 01:48:01,876
- Stay down.
- Fire?

1606
01:48:02,001 --> 01:48:04,587
No, God damn it,
stay down, stay still.

1607
01:48:04,754 --> 01:48:05,755
Don't fire.

1608
01:48:10,217 --> 01:48:11,469
Oh, God.

1609
01:48:20,478 --> 01:48:22,167
I don't see any ordnance.

1610
01:48:22,202 --> 01:48:23,856
I think they're going home.

1611
01:48:23,898 --> 01:48:26,609
No. They'll be back. We still
got planes on the ground.

1612
01:48:26,776 --> 01:48:28,778
Pilots, listen up.

1613
01:48:28,861 --> 01:48:30,905
Get all the speed
you can on the runway...

1614
01:48:31,072 --> 01:48:32,782
don't get on the stick
till the very end.

1615
01:48:32,865 --> 01:48:35,493
In the air, stay low
between the buildings.

1616
01:48:35,528 --> 01:48:37,168
You see any Zero
on your tail...

1617
01:48:37,203 --> 01:48:40,956
wipe him off, don't freeze.
Just keep moving.

1618
01:48:41,082 --> 01:48:45,544
Try to separate 'em,
take 'em out one by one.

1619
01:48:45,628 --> 01:48:48,506
P-40s can't outrun Zeros,
so don't try.

1620
01:48:48,547 --> 01:48:49,882
We have to outfly 'em.

1621
01:48:49,924 --> 01:48:51,926
We got high-level bombers!

1622
01:48:51,967 --> 01:48:53,094
They'll bust this hangar
wide open!

1623
01:48:53,219 --> 01:48:55,096
Grab the fifties! Let's move!

1624
01:48:57,098 --> 01:48:58,974
Move! Move!

1625
01:48:59,100 --> 01:49:01,519
Go, go, go!

1626
01:49:04,271 --> 01:49:05,981
Zeros!

1627
01:49:06,107 --> 01:49:08,192
Take cover! Take cover!

1628
01:49:17,868 --> 01:49:20,538
Take cover! Take cover!

1629
01:49:23,707 --> 01:49:24,834
Aah!

1630
01:49:32,133 --> 01:49:34,718
- Get down! Get down!
- Let's go! In the box!

1631
01:49:44,311 --> 01:49:45,563
Aah!

1632
01:49:52,153 --> 01:49:53,279
Danny!

1633
01:49:56,574 --> 01:49:58,159
Come on!

1634
01:49:58,284 --> 01:49:59,417
Come on, buddy!

1635
01:49:59,452 --> 01:50:02,037
Leave him, he's dead!
He's dead!

1636
01:50:10,004 --> 01:50:11,630
They're kicking our butt.

1637
01:50:11,756 --> 01:50:14,341
Get to the airplanes!
Go, go, go!

1638
01:50:16,177 --> 01:50:18,596
Run! Red, Anthony, let's go!

1639
01:50:22,558 --> 01:50:25,770
Come on, help me!
Goddamn belts!

1640
01:50:29,482 --> 01:50:30,900
Let's go! Come on!

1641
01:50:38,866 --> 01:50:40,326
Knock 'em dead.

1642
01:50:40,367 --> 01:50:42,078
Quick! Get in! Put this on!

1643
01:50:43,662 --> 01:50:47,249
They're coming around.
Bring 'em out! Let's go!

1644
01:50:54,256 --> 01:50:56,926
Red, get out of here,
God damn it! Go!

1645
01:50:59,512 --> 01:51:01,368
Come on, let's go.

1646
01:51:01,403 --> 01:51:03,224
Joe, get out the way!

1647
01:51:03,349 --> 01:51:04,809
I'm rollin'!

1648
01:51:07,228 --> 01:51:08,813
Clear! Go!

1649
01:51:08,896 --> 01:51:10,940
Oh, God. Planes!

1650
01:51:12,108 --> 01:51:13,234
Come on, help me!

1651
01:51:15,986 --> 01:51:19,407
Hey, Joe! You got three Zeros
behind you!

1652
01:51:29,291 --> 01:51:31,544
Turn! Turn!

1653
01:51:32,837 --> 01:51:33,963
Oh, God!

1654
01:51:36,549 --> 01:51:37,675
Aah!

1655
01:51:45,850 --> 01:51:46,851
Oh, shit.

1656
01:51:46,976 --> 01:51:49,145
What are you doing? Get going!

1657
01:51:49,228 --> 01:51:52,022
Danny, start that thing up
and get in the air.

1658
01:51:52,148 --> 01:51:53,691
I'm not much good without
a wing man. I need you!

1659
01:51:53,858 --> 01:51:54,859
I got you!

1660
01:51:56,694 --> 01:51:58,738
Let's do it!

1661
01:52:16,756 --> 01:52:18,883
It's real tight, Rafe!
Real tight!

1662
01:52:33,898 --> 01:52:36,046
Hey, Rafe, I'm not sure
we have enough runway!

1663
01:52:36,081 --> 01:52:38,194
Get your airspeed up
before you leave the dirt!

1664
01:52:38,319 --> 01:52:40,362
Don't freeze. Don't freeze.

1665
01:52:44,658 --> 01:52:47,244
I don't think
I'm gonna make it over!

1666
01:52:47,369 --> 01:52:48,621
Come on! Come on!

1667
01:52:58,214 --> 01:52:59,799
We did it! I'm up!

1668
01:53:01,801 --> 01:53:03,636
We got Zeros behind us!

1669
01:53:05,513 --> 01:53:06,931
How many you see back there?

1670
01:53:11,519 --> 01:53:12,812
We got five on our six!

1671
01:53:18,943 --> 01:53:20,945
Take it down to the deck, now!

1672
01:53:29,537 --> 01:53:30,996
We gotta split 'em up.

1673
01:53:32,248 --> 01:53:33,290
You take left, I'll take right.

1674
01:53:39,296 --> 01:53:42,133
Earl, get some guns
in that goddamn tower!

1675
01:53:42,168 --> 01:53:45,553
OK! Let's go! Into the truck!

1676
01:53:51,434 --> 01:53:52,977
Danny, I got three on my six.

1677
01:54:09,577 --> 01:54:10,870
Whoo!

1678
01:54:14,457 --> 01:54:17,168
Stop! Stop! Let's go!

1679
01:54:17,293 --> 01:54:18,753
Let's go! Move it!
Move it, Red!

1680
01:54:20,337 --> 01:54:21,881
- Let's go!
- Gimme the fifty!

1681
01:54:23,758 --> 01:54:26,469
Let's go! All right!

1682
01:54:30,181 --> 01:54:32,183
I still got
two behind me, Rafe.

1683
01:54:41,776 --> 01:54:43,360
Yaah!

1684
01:54:46,072 --> 01:54:48,074
Son of a bitch!

1685
01:54:52,078 --> 01:54:53,204
Whoa!

1686
01:54:56,791 --> 01:54:59,668
Earl, God damn it,
get some guns in that tower!

1687
01:54:59,794 --> 01:55:02,338
On the tower.
Going ten stories up.

1688
01:55:02,379 --> 01:55:03,798
It's a long son of a bitch.

1689
01:55:12,389 --> 01:55:14,517
Rafe, they're all over me!
I can't get them off me!

1690
01:55:22,817 --> 01:55:24,235
Danny,
I still got three on my tail!

1691
01:55:28,197 --> 01:55:29,698
Keep jinking it!
Don't let them get a handle!

1692
01:55:29,824 --> 01:55:31,242
I can't shake 'em!

1693
01:55:32,827 --> 01:55:33,994
God damn it.

1694
01:55:35,538 --> 01:55:37,998
Danny, let's play chicken
with these Jap suckers!

1695
01:55:38,124 --> 01:55:39,542
I'm with you.

1696
01:55:41,544 --> 01:55:43,129
Jesus!

1697
01:55:47,258 --> 01:55:49,677
- I'm coming right at you!
- Don't brake till I tell you.

1698
01:55:51,512 --> 01:55:52,555
Not yet! Not yet!

1699
01:55:53,722 --> 01:55:54,849
Come on!

1700
01:55:56,434 --> 01:55:57,560
Go left! Now!

1701
01:56:02,148 --> 01:56:05,151
- Whoo! We got 'em!
- Ha ha ha!

1702
01:56:05,234 --> 01:56:06,444
Set up over there!

1703
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:10,865
Come on, load it!

1704
01:56:10,906 --> 01:56:12,032
We're on the tower.

1705
01:56:14,285 --> 01:56:16,912
I got one on my tail.
I'll bring him right by you.

1706
01:56:16,996 --> 01:56:20,875
He's comin' around!
Let's get this Jap sucker!

1707
01:56:24,170 --> 01:56:26,213
Hold your fire. Here he comes.

1708
01:56:27,757 --> 01:56:29,884
You better be cocked and locked
when I come by!

1709
01:56:32,303 --> 01:56:33,596
Hold your fire!

1710
01:56:35,347 --> 01:56:36,599
Fire!

1711
01:56:44,190 --> 01:56:46,192
Whoo! Good shootin', boys!

1712
01:56:46,227 --> 01:56:47,943
Nice shot, Earl!

1713
01:56:48,027 --> 01:56:49,487
Let's head over
to battleship row!

1714
01:56:49,522 --> 01:56:50,613
I'm with you!

1715
01:56:59,371 --> 01:57:01,207
Let's go do some business.

1716
01:57:03,209 --> 01:57:04,335
I'm going after 'em.

1717
01:57:15,679 --> 01:57:17,515
Rafe! I got him!

1718
01:57:18,974 --> 01:57:21,227
- P-40's!
- Yeah!

1719
01:57:23,521 --> 01:57:24,814
They're pulling
into the clouds!

1720
01:57:24,939 --> 01:57:26,690
We ain't gonna let these
sons of bitches get home!

1721
01:57:34,115 --> 01:57:36,117
How do you like someone
shooting back at you?

1722
01:57:46,710 --> 01:57:48,129
Oh, I'm on your ass now!

1723
01:57:53,134 --> 01:57:54,844
Yeah! I got one!

1724
01:57:56,554 --> 01:57:58,139
Come on!

1725
01:58:10,025 --> 01:58:11,152
God, come on!

1726
01:58:19,910 --> 01:58:21,287
Come on, stay in there!

1727
01:58:29,170 --> 01:58:30,463
Whoa!

1728
01:58:34,341 --> 01:58:36,302
I got you, you son of a bitch!

1729
01:59:23,808 --> 01:59:25,893
Who taught you how to fly,
Lieutenant?

1730
01:59:27,812 --> 01:59:29,188
He did.

1731
01:59:35,820 --> 01:59:38,697
I have to amputate here!
I have to amputate!

1732
01:59:38,732 --> 01:59:40,116
You're not gonna die!

1733
01:59:40,199 --> 01:59:41,826
I got you.
Hold onto this...

1734
01:59:41,951 --> 01:59:43,411
Sandra,
we're running out of morphine.

1735
01:59:43,536 --> 01:59:45,955
Find some way to mark 'em...

1736
01:59:45,996 --> 01:59:49,959
So we can keep track
of who's got morphine already.

1737
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:51,877
Tell me about your ship.
What ship are you from?

1738
01:59:51,961 --> 01:59:54,547
It's not marking.
Have you got a marker?

1739
01:59:58,843 --> 02:00:01,783
Use my lipstick!
Put "M" for morphine.

1740
02:00:01,818 --> 02:00:04,723
- We need a tourniquet!
- Tourniquet!

1741
02:00:06,267 --> 02:00:08,018
Where are the clamps?

1742
02:00:13,607 --> 02:00:15,234
There's nothing left!

1743
02:00:17,236 --> 02:00:19,155
- Evelyn!
- Here, use this.

1744
02:00:19,196 --> 02:00:21,323
Go outside.
There's too many to help.

1745
02:00:21,449 --> 02:00:22,832
Sort them out.

1746
02:00:22,867 --> 02:00:25,035
Only those that can be saved
you bring in.

1747
02:00:25,161 --> 02:00:26,746
I can't...

1748
02:00:26,871 --> 02:00:28,622
No, please,
I need you to do it!

1749
02:00:28,748 --> 02:00:29,915
Go! Go!

1750
02:00:45,347 --> 02:00:47,183
Aah!

1751
02:00:57,485 --> 02:01:00,362
Don't look at anyone
without a mark!

1752
02:01:00,488 --> 02:01:02,198
I told you, stand back!

1753
02:01:02,239 --> 02:01:03,783
Keep 'em outside!

1754
02:01:03,866 --> 02:01:06,243
Come on! Let's go!

1755
02:01:08,245 --> 02:01:09,914
Wait here.

1756
02:01:09,955 --> 02:01:12,917
Don't touch me, you Jap!
Get your hands off me!

1757
02:01:12,958 --> 02:01:14,794
Get him into critical.

1758
02:01:14,877 --> 02:01:18,214
- Get him off me.
- Critical, frontward!

1759
02:01:20,091 --> 02:01:22,259
How bad am I?

1760
02:01:22,384 --> 02:01:24,095
You're gonna be just fine,
sweetheart.

1761
02:01:24,220 --> 02:01:26,514
- I don't wanna die.
- You're not gonna die.

1762
02:01:26,549 --> 02:01:28,516
I've got your hand.

1763
02:01:28,641 --> 02:01:30,518
Do you have enough morphine
to make him comfortable?

1764
02:01:30,553 --> 02:01:31,644
He won't make it.

1765
02:01:31,685 --> 02:01:32,895
Line the critical up!

1766
02:01:32,937 --> 02:01:34,814
Get him morphine.
Take him over there!

1767
02:01:34,849 --> 02:01:36,565
Burn victims by the tree!

1768
02:01:36,690 --> 02:01:38,908
I just found her!

1769
02:01:38,943 --> 02:01:40,799
I don't think she's breathing.

1770
02:01:40,834 --> 02:01:42,655
No, she's dead. Take her-

1771
02:01:45,950 --> 02:01:48,828
Oh, God.

1772
02:01:48,869 --> 02:01:52,581
Are you sure, Ev?
Check her again.

1773
02:01:52,706 --> 02:01:55,126
She's dead.
Take her over there!

1774
02:01:55,209 --> 02:01:56,961
But you've gotta be sure!

1775
02:01:57,002 --> 02:01:59,547
She's dead!
Go back to work, Sandra.

1776
02:01:59,588 --> 02:02:03,259
I don't know what to do!

1777
02:03:35,101 --> 02:03:36,644
Over here!

1778
02:03:36,811 --> 02:03:37,812
Admiral?

1779
02:03:37,937 --> 02:03:40,189
From Washington.

1780
02:03:41,232 --> 02:03:43,818
"Attack by Japan
considered imminent. "

1781
02:03:48,531 --> 02:03:50,699
They're only an hour late.

1782
02:04:48,466 --> 02:04:49,724
How can we help?

1783
02:04:49,759 --> 02:04:52,553
We need blood. Come on.

1784
02:04:55,473 --> 02:04:57,767
Remember, son,
hold on to your faith.

1785
02:04:57,802 --> 02:04:59,894
1,500 cartons over there.

1786
02:05:00,019 --> 02:05:02,063
"'Today you will be
with me in paradise...

1787
02:05:02,188 --> 02:05:03,606
"so fear not. "

1788
02:05:03,647 --> 02:05:05,740
Fear not, my son.

1789
02:05:05,775 --> 02:05:08,319
You are a man truly blessed.

1790
02:05:08,360 --> 02:05:11,072
You will die
in a state of grace.

1791
02:05:11,197 --> 02:05:15,076
Remember, pain is temporary,
but glory is forever.

1792
02:05:15,201 --> 02:05:17,168
Hold on to your faith, my son.

1793
02:05:17,203 --> 02:05:20,498
You'll be with God, the saints,
and the angels soon.

1794
02:05:20,623 --> 02:05:22,173
I absolve you of your sins...

1795
02:05:22,208 --> 02:05:26,212
in the name of the Father,
the Son, the Holy Spirit.

1796
02:05:26,247 --> 02:05:28,798
Innomine patris et fili,
et spiritus sancti.

1797
02:05:28,881 --> 02:05:30,508
Amen.

1798
02:05:37,098 --> 02:05:39,100
Go with God, my son.

1799
02:05:45,689 --> 02:05:47,942
We've got men trapped
everywhere in the harbor.

1800
02:05:48,109 --> 02:05:49,819
We need help
from anybody who can move.

1801
02:05:57,868 --> 02:05:59,537
There's somebody in here!

1802
02:05:59,662 --> 02:06:01,414
Get somebody down here!

1803
02:06:03,833 --> 02:06:05,251
They're cutting through!

1804
02:06:10,840 --> 02:06:13,968
I hear somebody!
Get some guys up here!

1805
02:06:14,003 --> 02:06:16,011
Pull!

1806
02:06:18,723 --> 02:06:21,851
Get us out!
It's filling with water!

1807
02:06:21,892 --> 02:06:23,561
Get an airline in here!

1808
02:06:26,272 --> 02:06:29,150
We need the air hose!
What can we do?

1809
02:06:33,571 --> 02:06:35,990
It won't cut any faster!

1810
02:06:38,909 --> 02:06:42,288
- Cut him out!
- Aah!

1811
02:07:14,487 --> 02:07:15,905
Yesterday...

1812
02:07:15,946 --> 02:07:20,326
December 7, 1941...

1813
02:07:21,535 --> 02:07:24,789
a date
which will live in infamy...

1814
02:07:24,824 --> 02:07:27,792
the United States of America...

1815
02:07:27,875 --> 02:07:30,920
was suddenly
and deliberately attacked...

1816
02:07:31,087 --> 02:07:35,674
by naval and air forces
of the empire of Japan.

1817
02:07:38,094 --> 02:07:39,261
It is obvious...

1818
02:07:39,345 --> 02:07:43,933
that planning the attack
began many weeks ago.

1819
02:07:43,974 --> 02:07:46,456
During the intervening time...

1820
02:07:46,491 --> 02:07:48,938
the Japanese government...

1821
02:07:48,979 --> 02:07:52,525
has deliberately sought to
deceive the United States...

1822
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:54,652
by false statements...

1823
02:07:54,693 --> 02:07:59,407
and expressions of hope
for continued peace.

1824
02:07:59,532 --> 02:08:04,412
The attack yesterday
on the Hawaiian Islands...

1825
02:08:04,537 --> 02:08:09,667
has caused severe damage
to American military forces.

1826
02:08:09,708 --> 02:08:11,252
I regret to tell you...

1827
02:08:11,293 --> 02:08:16,674
that over 3,000 American lives
have been lost.

1828
02:08:16,715 --> 02:08:19,718
No matter how long
it may take us...

1829
02:08:19,844 --> 02:08:23,514
to overcome
this premeditated invasion...

1830
02:08:23,556 --> 02:08:27,727
the American people,
in their righteous might...

1831
02:08:27,852 --> 02:08:30,438
will win through
to absolute victory.

1832
02:08:34,567 --> 02:08:40,573
Because of this unprovoked,
dastardly attack by Japan...

1833
02:08:40,740 --> 02:08:44,535
I ask that the Congress
declare a state of war.

1834
02:08:50,108 --> 02:08:51,567
Is it true...

1835
02:08:51,651 --> 02:08:55,238
men are still trapped alive
inside the Arizona?

1836
02:08:57,240 --> 02:08:59,242
We can hear tapping
from inside the hull.

1837
02:08:59,367 --> 02:09:00,910
We're doing everything we can
to get to them...

1838
02:09:00,952 --> 02:09:02,829
but they're
forty feet below water.

1839
02:09:09,419 --> 02:09:12,651
We've been trained to think
that we're invincible.

1840
02:09:12,686 --> 02:09:15,883
And now our proudest ships
have been destroyed...

1841
02:09:15,967 --> 02:09:19,887
by an enemy
we considered inferior.

1842
02:09:19,971 --> 02:09:22,223
We're on the ropes, gentlemen.

1843
02:09:22,265 --> 02:09:26,227
That's exactly why
we have to strike back now.

1844
02:09:26,269 --> 02:09:29,112
We'll attack the Marshall
and Gilbert Islands, sir.

1845
02:09:29,147 --> 02:09:32,984
I mean hitting the heart of
Japan the way they have hit us.

1846
02:09:34,861 --> 02:09:36,863
Mr. President...

1847
02:09:36,904 --> 02:09:40,324
Pearl Harbor caught us unawares
because we didn't face facts.

1848
02:09:40,450 --> 02:09:43,418
This isn't a time
for ignoring them again.

1849
02:09:43,453 --> 02:09:46,873
We have long-range bombers,
but no place to launch them.

1850
02:09:46,914 --> 02:09:50,752
Midway is too far,
and Russia won't allow us...

1851
02:09:50,877 --> 02:09:52,170
to launch a raid from there.

1852
02:09:53,463 --> 02:09:54,547
Admiral?

1853
02:09:54,589 --> 02:09:56,007
Navy's planes are small.

1854
02:09:56,048 --> 02:09:57,884
They carry light loads
and have a short range.

1855
02:09:58,009 --> 02:10:01,304
We'd have to get them within
a few hundred miles of Japan.

1856
02:10:01,339 --> 02:10:04,474
We'd risk our carriers,
and if we lose them...

1857
02:10:04,509 --> 02:10:06,184
we'll have no shield
against invasion.

1858
02:10:06,309 --> 02:10:09,228
Does anyone in this room
think victory is possible...

1859
02:10:09,312 --> 02:10:10,897
without facing danger?

1860
02:10:11,022 --> 02:10:13,941
We are at war.
Of course there's a risk.

1861
02:10:14,066 --> 02:10:16,194
But consider the risk,
Mr. President.

1862
02:10:16,319 --> 02:10:19,072
If the Japanese
invade us right now...

1863
02:10:19,197 --> 02:10:22,200
they would reach Chicago
before we could stop them.

1864
02:10:24,494 --> 02:10:26,370
Gentlemen...

1865
02:10:28,081 --> 02:10:33,044
most of you did not know me
when I had the use of my legs.

1866
02:10:33,086 --> 02:10:36,798
I was strong and proud...
and arrogant.

1867
02:10:36,881 --> 02:10:40,635
Now I wonder,
every hour of my life...

1868
02:10:40,676 --> 02:10:44,555
why God put me into this chair.

1869
02:10:44,639 --> 02:10:48,101
But when I see defeat
in the eyes of my country men-

1870
02:10:48,136 --> 02:10:50,485
in your eyes, right now-

1871
02:10:50,520 --> 02:10:53,523
I start to think that
maybe he brought me down...

1872
02:10:53,648 --> 02:10:54,941
for times like these...

1873
02:10:54,982 --> 02:10:57,652
when we all need to be reminded
who we truly are-

1874
02:10:57,819 --> 02:11:00,947
that we will not
give up or give in.

1875
02:11:00,988 --> 02:11:02,407
Mr. President,
with all respect, sir...

1876
02:11:02,532 --> 02:11:04,409
what you're asking
can't be done.

1877
02:11:20,425 --> 02:11:22,844
- Mr. President!
- Get back, George!

1878
02:11:22,879 --> 02:11:24,137
Get back.

1879
02:11:36,441 --> 02:11:38,985
Do not tell me...

1880
02:11:39,026 --> 02:11:41,154
it can't be done.

1881
02:11:45,867 --> 02:11:48,870
Japan continues
its military conquest...

1882
02:11:48,911 --> 02:11:50,037
throughout the Pacific.

1883
02:11:51,748 --> 02:11:53,256
But, back home...

1884
02:11:53,291 --> 02:11:55,710
millions of American workers
band together...

1885
02:11:55,752 --> 02:11:58,629
bringing factories to life
to avenge Pearl Harbor.

1886
02:12:03,176 --> 02:12:05,887
Mr. President, we have an idea
how to bomb the Japanese.

1887
02:12:06,012 --> 02:12:08,765
Sir, it's risky...

1888
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:10,308
but it's bold.

1889
02:12:11,934 --> 02:12:14,353
- Who are you?
- I, sir?

1890
02:12:14,479 --> 02:12:16,063
Captain Low, Mr. President.

1891
02:12:17,482 --> 02:12:19,650
He's a submariner.
He came up with this idea.

1892
02:12:19,776 --> 02:12:22,195
I like sub commanders.

1893
02:12:22,236 --> 02:12:26,365
They don't have time
for bullshit, and neither do I.

1894
02:12:26,491 --> 02:12:27,950
Fire away, gentlemen.

1895
02:12:44,634 --> 02:12:46,511
And where is God in all this?

1896
02:12:48,346 --> 02:12:53,101
Our enemies believe
a divine wind protects them.

1897
02:12:53,226 --> 02:12:56,938
But we see our friends
laid out here before us.

1898
02:13:18,835 --> 02:13:19,961
Hey, Captain.

1899
02:13:43,734 --> 02:13:45,319
Lieutenants Rafe McCawley,
Daniel Walker.

1900
02:13:45,445 --> 02:13:46,863
Yes, Major?

1901
02:13:47,029 --> 02:13:50,283
You're both going stateside.
Fly out in two hours.

1902
02:13:50,450 --> 02:13:51,701
What for, sir?

1903
02:13:51,743 --> 02:13:53,327
Ask Colonel Doolittle.

1904
02:13:56,998 --> 02:13:58,332
Yes, sir.

1905
02:14:14,056 --> 02:14:15,349
You're packing.

1906
02:14:18,603 --> 02:14:19,861
Orders.

1907
02:14:19,896 --> 02:14:22,607
What kind of orders?

1908
02:14:22,648 --> 02:14:26,194
The top-secret kind.

1909
02:14:26,319 --> 02:14:28,362
The dangerous kind.

1910
02:14:30,364 --> 02:14:32,040
I can't find Danny.

1911
02:14:32,075 --> 02:14:34,368
Is that why you're here?

1912
02:14:34,494 --> 02:14:35,787
Looking for Danny?

1913
02:14:37,205 --> 02:14:38,498
Probably saying good-bye
to his squadron.

1914
02:14:38,581 --> 02:14:39,624
We've been assigned
to Doolittle.

1915
02:14:49,550 --> 02:14:51,219
I wasn't looking for Danny.

1916
02:14:56,516 --> 02:14:57,975
I couldn't have you go away...

1917
02:14:58,101 --> 02:14:59,936
without you
understanding something.

1918
02:15:05,525 --> 02:15:07,652
Yeah. You don't have
to explain anything.

1919
02:15:07,819 --> 02:15:12,115
I do, because you're acting
like I didn't love you.

1920
02:15:12,198 --> 02:15:15,284
Evelyn,
loving you kept me alive.

1921
02:15:26,254 --> 02:15:27,804
I should've died over there.

1922
02:15:27,839 --> 02:15:32,427
When I was in that water,
I made a deal with God.

1923
02:15:34,137 --> 02:15:35,812
I told him I was sorry...

1924
02:15:35,847 --> 02:15:38,599
that I knew I'd been a fool
for leaving you...

1925
02:15:38,683 --> 02:15:40,852
trying to go over there
and be a hero...

1926
02:15:42,270 --> 02:15:44,272
and I promised I'd never ask
for anything again...

1927
02:15:45,565 --> 02:15:48,443
if I could just see you
one more time.

1928
02:15:51,988 --> 02:15:53,156
And you know what?

1929
02:15:55,324 --> 02:15:56,617
It was worth it.

1930
02:15:58,578 --> 02:16:02,039
You kept me alive, Evelyn.
You brought me home.

1931
02:16:03,166 --> 02:16:05,460
So I'm gonna stand by
my end of the deal.

1932
02:16:05,543 --> 02:16:07,295
I'm gonna walk away.

1933
02:16:07,336 --> 02:16:10,590
And I won't ask you
for anything.

1934
02:16:10,757 --> 02:16:12,467
But I just want to know why.

1935
02:16:12,550 --> 02:16:15,470
Just tell me that, will you,
please? Just tell me why.

1936
02:16:17,054 --> 02:16:19,182
Rafe, I'm pregnant.

1937
02:16:28,232 --> 02:16:30,026
Oh, my God.

1938
02:16:33,362 --> 02:16:36,657
I didn't even know until
the day you turned up alive.

1939
02:16:38,242 --> 02:16:40,787
And then all this happened.

1940
02:16:42,497 --> 02:16:43,790
I haven't told Danny.

1941
02:16:45,374 --> 02:16:47,502
I don't want him to know.

1942
02:16:47,627 --> 02:16:49,504
All he needs to think about...

1943
02:16:49,545 --> 02:16:52,340
is how to do this mission
and get back alive.

1944
02:16:55,218 --> 02:16:58,478
Rafe, all I ever wanted...

1945
02:16:58,513 --> 02:17:01,682
was for us to have a home,
grow old together...

1946
02:17:01,808 --> 02:17:04,776
but life never asked me
what I wanted.

1947
02:17:04,811 --> 02:17:07,939
Now, I'm gonna give Danny
my whole heart...

1948
02:17:09,941 --> 02:17:12,235
but I don't think I'll ever
look at another sunset...

1949
02:17:12,276 --> 02:17:13,986
without thinking of you.

1950
02:17:18,116 --> 02:17:19,909
I'll love you my whole life.

1951
02:17:57,864 --> 02:17:59,741
I'll see you on board.

1952
02:18:17,216 --> 02:18:21,304
You know, the only thing
that scares me...

1953
02:18:21,345 --> 02:18:24,056
is that you might love him
more than you love me.

1954
02:18:26,768 --> 02:18:28,311
I love you, Danny.

1955
02:18:31,481 --> 02:18:34,192
And I'll be here waiting
for you when you come back.

1956
02:18:52,376 --> 02:18:53,503
Follow me.

1957
02:18:57,256 --> 02:18:58,674
Colonel.

1958
02:19:02,929 --> 02:19:04,680
Congratulations
on your promotion, sir.

1959
02:19:04,806 --> 02:19:06,516
I heard what you did.

1960
02:19:06,551 --> 02:19:08,226
We can explain that, sir.

1961
02:19:08,261 --> 02:19:09,977
Explain what?

1962
02:19:10,103 --> 02:19:12,814
Whatever it is
you heard about us, sir.

1963
02:19:12,939 --> 02:19:14,524
You mean the hula shirts
you were flying in?

1964
02:19:19,904 --> 02:19:22,198
Or the seven planes
you shot down?

1965
02:19:25,368 --> 02:19:28,830
You're both being awarded
the Silver Star...

1966
02:19:28,955 --> 02:19:30,832
and promoted to captain.

1967
02:19:32,291 --> 02:19:34,710
Is that the good news,
sir, or...

1968
02:19:34,836 --> 02:19:36,421
You're just about
the only pilots in the Army...

1969
02:19:36,546 --> 02:19:38,840
with combat experience.

1970
02:19:38,965 --> 02:19:40,550
I need you for a mission...

1971
02:19:40,591 --> 02:19:42,718
I've been ordered
to put together.

1972
02:19:44,262 --> 02:19:46,013
You know what top secret is?

1973
02:19:46,139 --> 02:19:47,397
Yes, sir.

1974
02:19:47,432 --> 02:19:50,143
It's the kind of mission
where you get medals.

1975
02:19:50,178 --> 02:19:52,402
But they send 'em
to your relatives.

1976
02:19:52,437 --> 02:19:54,564
Top secret means
you train for something...

1977
02:19:54,689 --> 02:19:57,115
never done before
in aviation history...

1978
02:19:57,150 --> 02:19:59,277
and you go without knowing
where you're going.

1979
02:20:00,611 --> 02:20:04,323
You do it on that basis
or not at all.

1980
02:20:04,449 --> 02:20:05,742
I'll go, sir.

1981
02:20:06,701 --> 02:20:08,578
I'll go, too, sir.

1982
02:20:10,747 --> 02:20:14,000
By the way, the Brits sent
over your personal effects.

1983
02:20:14,041 --> 02:20:15,168
Thank you, sir.

1984
02:20:15,293 --> 02:20:16,586
There's only one more thing.

1985
02:20:16,711 --> 02:20:20,465
Leave your goddamn hula shirts
at home.

1986
02:20:23,468 --> 02:20:24,594
Dear Rafe...

1987
02:20:24,761 --> 02:20:27,054
It's so strange
to be this far from you...

1988
02:20:27,180 --> 02:20:31,225
but you should know this-
every night...

1989
02:20:40,610 --> 02:20:42,779
I've been looking
all over for you.

1990
02:20:44,197 --> 02:20:45,907
Danny, this...

1991
02:20:47,325 --> 02:20:49,494
this ain't no time
to leave things unsaid.

1992
02:20:50,787 --> 02:20:52,754
Now, we gotta face facts here.

1993
02:20:52,789 --> 02:20:56,042
The fact is, we just both love
the same woman.

1994
02:21:03,633 --> 02:21:06,636
She's the first girl I ever
felt this way about, Rafe.

1995
02:21:09,222 --> 02:21:12,558
I couldn't help what happened
any more than you could.

1996
02:21:16,813 --> 02:21:19,107
This is different,
though, Danny.

1997
02:21:19,232 --> 02:21:20,900
Evelyn already lost
the man she loved once.

1998
02:21:20,942 --> 02:21:22,902
I just don't want it to see
that happen to her again.

1999
02:21:22,944 --> 02:21:26,114
Guys like us got no choice.
This is war.

2000
02:21:26,197 --> 02:21:27,698
She knows that.

2001
02:21:27,824 --> 02:21:30,243
Danny, don't do this.

2002
02:21:30,368 --> 02:21:31,702
Don't go on this mission.

2003
02:21:32,995 --> 02:21:34,831
You got nothing to prove.

2004
02:21:36,207 --> 02:21:38,543
You've been protecting me
since we were kids.

2005
02:21:40,128 --> 02:21:41,838
Yeah, well...

2006
02:21:41,879 --> 02:21:43,840
you do tend to need it
from time to time.

2007
02:22:03,443 --> 02:22:05,445
The mission I'm asking you
to volunteer for...

2008
02:22:05,570 --> 02:22:07,155
is exceptionally dangerous.

2009
02:22:08,030 --> 02:22:10,575
Take a look at the man
beside you.

2010
02:22:10,700 --> 02:22:13,161
It's a good bet
that in the next six weeks...

2011
02:22:13,286 --> 02:22:16,456
you or he...

2012
02:22:16,539 --> 02:22:17,707
will be dead.

2013
02:22:20,918 --> 02:22:23,463
Everyone brave enough
to accept this...

2014
02:22:24,881 --> 02:22:26,549
step forward.

2015
02:22:34,599 --> 02:22:36,476
Your grandmother
could take a B-25 off...

2016
02:22:36,559 --> 02:22:38,936
on a mile-long runway.

2017
02:22:39,061 --> 02:22:43,900
Well, I'm gonna train you
to do it in 467 feet.

2018
02:22:43,935 --> 02:22:47,487
Because at 468 feet...

2019
02:22:47,570 --> 02:22:49,489
you're dead.

2020
02:22:49,614 --> 02:22:50,747
And once you get it up...

2021
02:22:50,782 --> 02:22:53,576
you'll learn to fly it
like a fighter...

2022
02:22:53,618 --> 02:22:55,787
thirty feet off the ground.

2023
02:22:55,870 --> 02:22:57,080
I want you to say hello...

2024
02:22:57,205 --> 02:22:59,582
to Lieutenant Jack Richards,
Navy Aviation.

2025
02:22:59,624 --> 02:23:01,793
He'll help us
lighten these fat ladies.

2026
02:23:01,876 --> 02:23:03,961
Dump that ash can.

2027
02:23:04,087 --> 02:23:06,380
See that bomb sight?
Get rid of it.

2028
02:23:06,506 --> 02:23:08,056
Colonel, he's crazy!

2029
02:23:08,091 --> 02:23:10,093
- The lady's fat!
- Listen to him.

2030
02:23:10,128 --> 02:23:12,095
She's fat.
We want a skinny lady!

2031
02:23:17,266 --> 02:23:18,935
Max power!

2032
02:23:21,813 --> 02:23:23,106
Get up, get up!

2033
02:23:23,940 --> 02:23:25,400
- Damn!
- How the heck-

2034
02:23:25,525 --> 02:23:26,818
Damn!

2035
02:23:34,700 --> 02:23:36,411
They just keep
rolling past that line.

2036
02:23:36,536 --> 02:23:37,919
Maybe it's a bad idea.

2037
02:23:37,954 --> 02:23:40,581
No, they're too heavy.
We gotta get drastic.

2038
02:23:40,706 --> 02:23:42,250
This armored plating goes.

2039
02:23:42,375 --> 02:23:45,128
I'm sure, I'm sure.
Lose it like a skirt, son.

2040
02:23:45,253 --> 02:23:46,712
Release brakes!

2041
02:23:48,840 --> 02:23:50,258
Come on, come on!

2042
02:23:52,218 --> 02:23:56,139
- God!
- Put every man on the line!

2043
02:23:58,724 --> 02:24:00,852
Let's show these boys
how this thing is done!

2044
02:24:02,979 --> 02:24:04,856
Come on! Max power.

2045
02:24:09,861 --> 02:24:12,029
Well, if he can do it...

2046
02:24:29,172 --> 02:24:31,174
Well, gentlemen,
now I can tell you...

2047
02:24:31,215 --> 02:24:33,050
that we're going to Tokyo.

2048
02:24:34,886 --> 02:24:36,471
And we're gonna bomb it.

2049
02:24:42,477 --> 02:24:44,187
That comes
as a special request...

2050
02:24:44,312 --> 02:24:46,606
directly from
President Roosevelt.

2051
02:24:46,647 --> 02:24:50,068
The Navy'll sneak us about
400 miles off the coast...

2052
02:24:50,193 --> 02:24:51,486
and we'll launch
from the carrier there.

2053
02:24:51,569 --> 02:24:53,071
Has that been done before?

2054
02:24:54,197 --> 02:24:55,656
Taking Army bombers
off Navy carriers?

2055
02:24:55,782 --> 02:24:58,910
- No.
- OK.

2056
02:24:58,951 --> 02:25:00,661
Any other questions?

2057
02:25:00,787 --> 02:25:02,789
Well, sir, is it even
possible to land...

2058
02:25:02,872 --> 02:25:05,041
a B-25
on an aircraft carrier deck?

2059
02:25:05,083 --> 02:25:06,918
That won't matter.

2060
02:25:07,043 --> 02:25:10,254
As soon as we're airborne,
the carrier heads for Hawaii.

2061
02:25:10,379 --> 02:25:12,507
But without them,
where do we land?

2062
02:25:12,632 --> 02:25:15,384
I have a phrase
I want you to memorize.

2063
02:25:16,928 --> 02:25:20,063
Wo shimeiguo ren.

2064
02:25:20,098 --> 02:25:22,391
It means "I am an American".

2065
02:25:23,935 --> 02:25:25,895
In Chinese.

2066
02:25:26,979 --> 02:25:28,523
Ain't gonna be any easier.

2067
02:25:28,648 --> 02:25:31,234
That's three feet shorter
than our practice runway.

2068
02:25:31,359 --> 02:25:34,278
- Fellas?
- Sir.

2069
02:25:34,404 --> 02:25:35,530
Sir.

2070
02:25:37,532 --> 02:25:39,242
Secretary of the Navy
gave me these.

2071
02:25:40,827 --> 02:25:42,085
What are they?

2072
02:25:42,120 --> 02:25:43,955
Friendship medals
the Japanese gave us...

2073
02:25:44,122 --> 02:25:45,665
when they were pretending
to want peace.

2074
02:25:45,832 --> 02:25:47,125
What'll you do with them?

2075
02:25:47,208 --> 02:25:49,710
Wire them to the bombs
and give them back.

2076
02:25:52,964 --> 02:25:55,098
So what's going on?

2077
02:25:55,133 --> 02:25:57,135
Well, sir,
we only have sixteen planes.

2078
02:25:57,260 --> 02:25:58,428
So?

2079
02:25:58,553 --> 02:26:01,848
When the Japs hit us,
they had more than 300.

2080
02:26:01,889 --> 02:26:04,016
How much difference
can we make?

2081
02:26:04,142 --> 02:26:05,893
It's not that we're afraid,
sir.

2082
02:26:05,977 --> 02:26:09,439
But we might die, and
we want to know what it's for.

2083
02:26:12,608 --> 02:26:15,445
You know, at Pearl,
they hit us with a sledgehammer.

2084
02:26:17,321 --> 02:26:20,575
This raid,
even if we make it through...

2085
02:26:20,616 --> 02:26:23,870
it'll only be a pin prick...

2086
02:26:23,995 --> 02:26:25,747
but it'll be straight
through their hearts.

2087
02:26:27,165 --> 02:26:30,626
Victory belongs to those
that believe in it the most...

2088
02:26:30,752 --> 02:26:32,253
and believe in it the longest.

2089
02:26:33,921 --> 02:26:36,466
We're gonna believe.

2090
02:26:36,549 --> 02:26:38,760
We're gonna make
America believe, too.

2091
02:26:38,795 --> 02:26:40,887
Colonel? I need a minute.

2092
02:26:43,347 --> 02:26:46,184
- Excuse me, Major Jackson?
- Yes?

2093
02:26:46,225 --> 02:26:47,351
Do you remember me?

2094
02:26:48,770 --> 02:26:50,445
Oh, sure I do.

2095
02:26:50,480 --> 02:26:52,899
I'm sorry.
I've been meaning to thank you.

2096
02:26:52,940 --> 02:26:54,484
Well, maybe you can.

2097
02:26:54,609 --> 02:26:57,862
When the news comes in
about the Doolittle boys...

2098
02:26:57,904 --> 02:26:59,489
I want to be
in the command post.

2099
02:27:00,573 --> 02:27:03,034
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're talking about.

2100
02:27:05,620 --> 02:27:07,622
How the hell
do you know about this mission?

2101
02:27:08,873 --> 02:27:10,792
Let's call it
an inadvertent disclosure.

2102
02:27:10,875 --> 02:27:13,211
Some flyboy you're dating
shot his mouth off.

2103
02:27:14,545 --> 02:27:16,506
Actually,
it's about two pilots.

2104
02:27:16,547 --> 02:27:19,766
I know they're going
into great danger.

2105
02:27:19,801 --> 02:27:22,095
I just want to be there
when the news tells us...

2106
02:27:22,220 --> 02:27:23,346
if they've lived or died.

2107
02:27:27,642 --> 02:27:30,103
Most officers would have
thrown you in the brig.

2108
02:27:30,138 --> 02:27:32,814
Most nurses
wouldn't keep their fingers...

2109
02:27:32,897 --> 02:27:34,232
plugged in your artery.

2110
02:27:39,987 --> 02:27:41,697
I can't promise you anything.

2111
02:27:48,413 --> 02:27:51,124
Hey, Red,
you think they picked us...

2112
02:27:51,249 --> 02:27:53,835
to do this
'cause we're young and dumb?

2113
02:27:55,211 --> 02:27:57,713
Come on, Gooz,
we're the tip of the sword.

2114
02:28:14,856 --> 02:28:16,441
In honor of our trip to Japan...

2115
02:28:16,566 --> 02:28:19,569
I got us some victory cigars!

2116
02:28:19,610 --> 02:28:22,412
- Yeah!
- There you go.

2117
02:28:22,447 --> 02:28:24,741
Put that in your insidepocket,
next to your heart.

2118
02:28:24,776 --> 02:28:26,576
You know, Jack,
we may lose this battle...

2119
02:28:26,611 --> 02:28:29,245
but we're gonna win this war.

2120
02:28:29,328 --> 02:28:31,748
- You know how I know?
- No.

2121
02:28:33,750 --> 02:28:34,751
Them.

2122
02:28:36,002 --> 02:28:37,462
'Cause they're rare.

2123
02:28:38,755 --> 02:28:41,174
And at times like these,
you see them...

2124
02:28:43,050 --> 02:28:44,302
stepping forward.

2125
02:28:46,179 --> 02:28:49,348
There's nothing stronger than
the heart of a volunteer, Jack.

2126
02:28:55,062 --> 02:28:56,189
My friends
in the war department...

2127
02:28:56,314 --> 02:28:58,608
don't want me
to lead this raid...

2128
02:28:58,775 --> 02:29:01,903
because they say
I'm too valuable.

2129
02:29:02,070 --> 02:29:04,051
They don't want me
up in the air...

2130
02:29:04,086 --> 02:29:06,032
flying with the men
that I've chosen...

2131
02:29:06,199 --> 02:29:09,494
that I've chewed out, cussed
out, pushed to the limit...

2132
02:29:12,205 --> 02:29:14,499
and that I've come to respect.

2133
02:29:16,793 --> 02:29:18,628
They want me to stand
on the flight deck...

2134
02:29:18,795 --> 02:29:21,214
and wave you off.
Well, I don't see it that way.

2135
02:29:23,382 --> 02:29:24,509
So I'm going with you.

2136
02:29:29,806 --> 02:29:31,349
We take off
tomorrow afternoon...

2137
02:29:31,390 --> 02:29:33,643
drop our fire,
and head for China.

2138
02:29:33,684 --> 02:29:36,229
Our mission
is to hit military targets...

2139
02:29:36,264 --> 02:29:38,196
aircraft and tank factories.

2140
02:29:38,231 --> 02:29:40,983
Colonel, you've given us
homing beacons...

2141
02:29:41,109 --> 02:29:43,986
but you said China is
overrun with Japanese troops.

2142
02:29:44,112 --> 02:29:46,114
What if the beacons
are switched off?

2143
02:29:46,197 --> 02:29:47,782
Bring her down
any way you can...

2144
02:29:47,817 --> 02:29:49,367
and do your best
to avoid capture.

2145
02:29:49,409 --> 02:29:52,412
What if we have to bail out
over Japan?

2146
02:29:52,537 --> 02:29:56,833
Well, in that situation,
I can't tell you what to do.

2147
02:29:56,958 --> 02:29:58,835
What would you do, Colonel?

2148
02:30:02,131 --> 02:30:03,966
I wasn't built
to be a prisoner...

2149
02:30:06,009 --> 02:30:08,846
so I would have
my crew bail out.

2150
02:30:08,971 --> 02:30:11,598
I'd find the sweetest
military target I could...

2151
02:30:11,723 --> 02:30:13,851
and drive my plane right
smack into the middle of it...

2152
02:30:18,941 --> 02:30:20,651
But that's just me.

2153
02:30:23,528 --> 02:30:25,781
I'm forty-five years old.
I'm an old man.

2154
02:30:25,822 --> 02:30:27,532
You guys have your whole lives
ahead of you...

2155
02:30:29,117 --> 02:30:30,827
so what you do is up to you.

2156
02:30:38,543 --> 02:30:41,672
The mission will launch
in a couple of hours.

2157
02:30:41,713 --> 02:30:43,257
You'll stay right in here.

2158
02:30:47,261 --> 02:30:48,553
Here. Stay here.

2159
02:30:48,679 --> 02:30:50,806
Don't talk to them.
They won't talk to you.

2160
02:30:50,847 --> 02:30:52,391
Pretend to type
the information we pass you.

2161
02:30:52,426 --> 02:30:53,558
That's it.

2162
02:30:55,519 --> 02:30:59,398
This is Orphan Annie
from Radio Tokyo.

2163
02:30:59,439 --> 02:31:02,109
To all the lonely boys
in the South Pacific...

2164
02:31:02,150 --> 02:31:04,403
watch out-
the enemy will get you.

2165
02:31:04,528 --> 02:31:05,571
Maybe she's right.

2166
02:31:10,284 --> 02:31:12,828
Japs transmitting!

2167
02:31:14,162 --> 02:31:16,707
Captain, radar reports
Japanese patrol boats.

2168
02:31:16,742 --> 02:31:18,417
- Range 400 yards.
- How many yards?

2169
02:31:18,458 --> 02:31:20,002
400 yards and closing, sir.

2170
02:31:20,085 --> 02:31:23,046
Richards, Japs!
400 yards! Let's go!

2171
02:31:23,130 --> 02:31:25,882
Admiral Halsey's ordering
the cruisers to open fire!

2172
02:31:26,008 --> 02:31:29,011
We gotta sink these Jap boats
before they give us away.

2173
02:31:29,046 --> 02:31:30,304
Go to general quarters!

2174
02:31:30,339 --> 02:31:32,740
Go, go, go, go!

2175
02:31:32,775 --> 02:31:35,142
Oh, my God.

2176
02:31:35,309 --> 02:31:37,894
This can't be good!

2177
02:31:38,020 --> 02:31:40,314
All hands,
man your battle stations.

2178
02:31:44,151 --> 02:31:47,321
Japs one mile away.
They reported our position.

2179
02:31:47,404 --> 02:31:50,324
Supposed to launch
400 miles away. How far are we?

2180
02:31:50,407 --> 02:31:51,909
624 miles.

2181
02:31:52,034 --> 02:31:54,161
- Jesus!
- What do you want to do?

2182
02:31:58,790 --> 02:32:01,335
Colonel, I don't know
if the planes...

2183
02:32:01,460 --> 02:32:03,211
can carry enough fuel
to make it to China.

2184
02:32:04,087 --> 02:32:06,340
Now. We launch now!

2185
02:32:07,925 --> 02:32:10,052
Army pilots! Man your planes!

2186
02:32:10,087 --> 02:32:12,054
Man your planes!

2187
02:32:14,765 --> 02:32:16,913
They're shooting at something.

2188
02:32:16,948 --> 02:32:19,061
- Let's go!
- It ain't a drill!

2189
02:32:30,656 --> 02:32:32,950
Colonel!
We're too far out to make it!

2190
02:32:33,075 --> 02:32:36,036
They need more fuel,
but they can't get too heavy!

2191
02:32:36,078 --> 02:32:39,790
Strip everything out of
this plane you don't need now!

2192
02:32:42,084 --> 02:32:43,669
Start pre-flight! Let's go!

2193
02:32:43,752 --> 02:32:46,380
Add ten cans of fuel
for each plane!

2194
02:32:46,505 --> 02:32:48,382
Every plane!

2195
02:32:51,551 --> 02:32:53,387
Let's go! Move!

2196
02:32:53,553 --> 02:32:54,805
Guys, get up there!

2197
02:32:54,972 --> 02:32:56,848
Lose those suitcases now!

2198
02:32:56,974 --> 02:32:58,558
- What's your favorite gun?
- What?

2199
02:32:58,684 --> 02:33:01,979
You want off this deck,
give me a gun now!

2200
02:33:02,062 --> 02:33:03,146
It's still too heavy!

2201
02:33:04,523 --> 02:33:07,818
Go to the kitchen,
get some broomsticks.

2202
02:33:07,985 --> 02:33:09,570
Cut 'em down, paint 'em black,
and bring them here.

2203
02:33:09,695 --> 02:33:12,739
We'll put a broomstick
where this gun was.

2204
02:33:12,864 --> 02:33:14,533
What are you doing
to my plane?

2205
02:33:14,575 --> 02:33:17,411
Tell your crew to take a piss
before they take off.

2206
02:33:20,706 --> 02:33:22,583
We got broomsticks
for tail guns.

2207
02:33:22,708 --> 02:33:26,128
Yeah.
Maybe it'll scare 'em.

2208
02:33:26,295 --> 02:33:28,171
You take care of yourself
up there.

2209
02:33:28,297 --> 02:33:29,298
Yeah, I will.

2210
02:33:29,423 --> 02:33:32,426
Danny, be careful, you hear me?

2211
02:33:32,593 --> 02:33:34,685
I will.
I'll see you, Rafe.

2212
02:33:34,720 --> 02:33:36,888
Rafe!
We're the tip of the sword!

2213
02:33:43,020 --> 02:33:46,023
- Turning on one!
- Turning on two!

2214
02:33:50,444 --> 02:33:51,904
All right.

2215
02:33:52,029 --> 02:33:53,739
You ready for this?

2216
02:33:56,408 --> 02:33:59,328
- Superchargers low and latched!
- Low and latched.

2217
02:33:59,411 --> 02:34:01,038
We're full into the wind!

2218
02:34:01,163 --> 02:34:03,206
More speed! More speed!

2219
02:34:14,343 --> 02:34:15,761
Are you nervous?

2220
02:34:15,796 --> 02:34:17,179
No-yes, sir. Yes.

2221
02:34:17,220 --> 02:34:18,764
When did you find religion?

2222
02:34:18,805 --> 02:34:21,058
When you assigned me
to this mission, sir.

2223
02:34:21,093 --> 02:34:22,726
Do me a favor.

2224
02:34:22,768 --> 02:34:25,187
- What's that, Colonel?
- Pray for both of us.

2225
02:34:25,229 --> 02:34:26,355
Tell me when!

2226
02:34:26,480 --> 02:34:27,814
Let's go!

2227
02:34:36,657 --> 02:34:38,200
Max power!

2228
02:34:41,370 --> 02:34:42,829
Oh, please.

2229
02:34:44,039 --> 02:34:46,416
Come on! Come on!

2230
02:34:55,801 --> 02:34:56,934
Yeah!

2231
02:34:56,969 --> 02:34:58,262
Way to go!

2232
02:35:00,055 --> 02:35:02,557
Jesus, that was short.

2233
02:35:04,393 --> 02:35:06,562
Move 'em up!

2234
02:35:06,687 --> 02:35:09,523
Full power, here we go!

2235
02:35:10,983 --> 02:35:12,442
Pull back!

2236
02:35:20,867 --> 02:35:22,411
Ha ha ha!

2237
02:35:23,745 --> 02:35:25,831
Come on, here we go, here we go!

2238
02:35:37,593 --> 02:35:38,885
We made it!

2239
02:35:57,029 --> 02:35:59,031
From Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo...

2240
02:35:59,066 --> 02:36:01,617
we have been described...

2241
02:36:01,700 --> 02:36:04,620
as a nation of weaklings
and playboys...

2242
02:36:04,745 --> 02:36:08,332
who hire British,
Russian, or Chinese soldiers...

2243
02:36:08,457 --> 02:36:10,918
to do our fighting for us.

2244
02:36:11,043 --> 02:36:13,754
Let them repeat that now.

2245
02:36:13,921 --> 02:36:17,466
Let them tell that to
General MacArthur and his men.

2246
02:36:17,633 --> 02:36:21,219
Let them tell that
to the soldiers who today...

2247
02:36:21,345 --> 02:36:25,057
are fighting hard in
the far waters of the Pacific.

2248
02:36:25,182 --> 02:36:29,353
Let them tell that to the boys
in the flying fortresses.

2249
02:36:29,388 --> 02:36:32,231
Let them tell that
to the Marines.

2250
02:36:33,774 --> 02:36:37,194
That's Japan, fellas.
Tighten up back there!

2251
02:36:37,236 --> 02:36:39,655
Man your guns!

2252
02:36:39,738 --> 02:36:41,073
We're in the enemy's backyard!

2253
02:36:43,200 --> 02:36:45,535
Look alive back there.
I see coastline.

2254
02:36:52,668 --> 02:36:54,253
Heads up, boys! Heads up!

2255
02:36:59,132 --> 02:37:00,968
Man your guns back there.

2256
02:37:01,093 --> 02:37:03,095
I'm cocked and locked!

2257
02:37:03,136 --> 02:37:04,554
Get ready, suckers!

2258
02:37:12,688 --> 02:37:14,273
Approaching
targets for bombing raid!

2259
02:37:14,398 --> 02:37:17,150
Open bomb bay doors.

2260
02:37:17,276 --> 02:37:19,403
Ripley,
you gota target in sight?

2261
02:37:20,988 --> 02:37:22,739
37 degrees!
Target in sight!

2262
02:37:31,999 --> 02:37:34,293
All right, boys,
let's knock their clocks off!

2263
02:37:34,376 --> 02:37:36,295
- Drop your ordnance!
- Bombs away!

2264
02:37:36,420 --> 02:37:38,297
One away!

2265
02:37:38,380 --> 02:37:40,591
- Bombs away!
- Bombs away!

2266
02:37:40,626 --> 02:37:42,301
Two away!

2267
02:37:51,310 --> 02:37:52,895
Three away!
Four away!

2268
02:37:57,190 --> 02:37:59,318
We caught 'em by surprise!

2269
02:37:59,443 --> 02:38:02,321
- Dropping ordnance!
- Bombs away!

2270
02:38:02,404 --> 02:38:04,615
...factory.

2271
02:38:10,037 --> 02:38:11,788
- Whoo!
- We got it!

2272
02:38:11,914 --> 02:38:13,916
We hit our targets!
Good job, raiders!

2273
02:38:26,929 --> 02:38:30,641
God! Jesus-what? Shit!

2274
02:38:32,059 --> 02:38:33,810
We got flak everywhere!

2275
02:38:36,063 --> 02:38:37,397
Go down there and get Gooz!

2276
02:38:37,481 --> 02:38:39,358
I want everyone to separate!

2277
02:38:39,399 --> 02:38:41,360
- Clean that up!
- Yes, sir.

2278
02:38:41,395 --> 02:38:42,653
Try and clean that up!

2279
02:38:42,778 --> 02:38:43,946
They're shooting flak at us!

2280
02:38:55,415 --> 02:38:57,834
We gotta get out of this shit,
Gooz!

2281
02:39:00,796 --> 02:39:04,675
- We got a fire!
- Tail's hit!

2282
02:39:04,800 --> 02:39:07,552
The electrics!
We got a fire back here!

2283
02:39:07,587 --> 02:39:10,055
I gotta short this out!

2284
02:39:10,097 --> 02:39:12,683
Get into the clouds,
Danny, right now!

2285
02:39:26,989 --> 02:39:28,282
God damn!

2286
02:39:29,575 --> 02:39:30,867
Red, go check that out!

2287
02:39:36,456 --> 02:39:37,874
We're getting covered!

2288
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:39,710
Just hope they don't hit a prop!

2289
02:39:42,379 --> 02:39:44,047
Unh!

2290
02:39:44,082 --> 02:39:45,716
I'm hit!

2291
02:39:45,841 --> 02:39:47,467
They're tearing
this plane apart!

2292
02:39:49,303 --> 02:39:51,179
Red, take it up, 800 feet.

2293
02:39:51,305 --> 02:39:52,723
Aah!

2294
02:39:55,601 --> 02:39:59,021
I think Theo's dead!
Theo, wake up!

2295
02:39:59,146 --> 02:40:01,148
Theo!

2296
02:40:01,315 --> 02:40:02,608
Get into the clouds,
Danny, right now!

2297
02:40:02,733 --> 02:40:03,859
Get up in that soup!

2298
02:40:03,901 --> 02:40:06,320
We're gonna pull out of this,
Gooz!

2299
02:40:19,333 --> 02:40:20,626
Thank you, George.

2300
02:40:25,714 --> 02:40:27,090
What is it, General?

2301
02:40:27,174 --> 02:40:30,177
Colonel Doolittle had to
advance his execution order...

2302
02:40:30,218 --> 02:40:31,929
by twelve hours, Mr. President.

2303
02:40:32,054 --> 02:40:33,764
There will be no homing beacons.

2304
02:40:33,805 --> 02:40:36,475
The plane carrying them
crashed en route to China...

2305
02:40:36,510 --> 02:40:37,935
and our bombers
may lack the fuel...

2306
02:40:38,060 --> 02:40:39,770
to reach the mainland, sir.

2307
02:40:39,811 --> 02:40:45,359
So our boys are flying blind
on empty tanks.

2308
02:40:47,194 --> 02:40:49,112
God help them.

2309
02:40:57,120 --> 02:40:59,414
We're still not
getting a signal.

2310
02:40:59,539 --> 02:41:01,958
All ocean and no land.

2311
02:41:01,993 --> 02:41:04,378
Homing in on nothing.

2312
02:41:06,797 --> 02:41:08,840
How many cans of fuel
we got left?

2313
02:41:08,966 --> 02:41:10,801
These are all empty!

2314
02:41:11,969 --> 02:41:13,387
Is this all you got?

2315
02:41:13,553 --> 02:41:15,097
That's all we got, Red.

2316
02:41:15,264 --> 02:41:19,518
Rafe! You better pray for land!

2317
02:41:23,272 --> 02:41:24,815
Break radio silence.

2318
02:41:26,400 --> 02:41:28,986
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

2319
02:41:29,111 --> 02:41:31,363
You're all brave souls.

2320
02:41:31,405 --> 02:41:34,575
The bravest I've ever had
the privilege of flying with.

2321
02:41:34,700 --> 02:41:37,452
But we're on our own.

2322
02:41:42,124 --> 02:41:44,876
This really was
a suicide mission.

2323
02:42:00,475 --> 02:42:01,894
Engine one's fluctuating.

2324
02:42:02,019 --> 02:42:04,396
We'll lose it any minute.

2325
02:42:05,731 --> 02:42:08,317
- Rafe, you gotta prime it.
- I am. How about now?

2326
02:42:11,486 --> 02:42:13,405
I see the coast.

2327
02:42:13,440 --> 02:42:15,324
I see the coast!

2328
02:42:16,325 --> 02:42:17,910
Copy that, Rafe.

2329
02:42:18,035 --> 02:42:19,620
We're gonna make it.

2330
02:42:19,745 --> 02:42:21,038
Danny, follow me.

2331
02:42:21,163 --> 02:42:22,915
We can make this.
I can see the coast now.

2332
02:42:23,040 --> 02:42:24,458
We're only a few miles out.

2333
02:42:24,499 --> 02:42:27,169
We gotta find
a soft landing spot.

2334
02:42:27,210 --> 02:42:28,921
I'm pushing up on two.

2335
02:42:29,046 --> 02:42:31,214
Hold on
for a hard landing!

2336
02:42:31,340 --> 02:42:32,925
I see rice paddies.

2337
02:42:33,050 --> 02:42:34,343
We'll bring it in right here.

2338
02:42:36,762 --> 02:42:38,764
Oh, God, engine one's dead.

2339
02:42:38,805 --> 02:42:41,099
We'll lose engine two
any second.

2340
02:42:44,728 --> 02:42:47,064
We can make it in. Easy.

2341
02:42:47,105 --> 02:42:50,108
Pull it back, glide in on fumes.

2342
02:42:52,402 --> 02:42:53,619
Japs!

2343
02:42:53,654 --> 02:42:55,781
We got Jap patrols
all over the place!

2344
02:42:55,948 --> 02:42:58,533
Japs! Land somewhere else!

2345
02:42:58,659 --> 02:43:01,036
Strap yourselves in!
We're coming in hard!

2346
02:43:01,078 --> 02:43:02,663
We're a deadstick.

2347
02:43:02,698 --> 02:43:04,248
Get outta the nose!

2348
02:43:05,540 --> 02:43:07,834
Hold on, boys!
We're going down!

2349
02:43:10,087 --> 02:43:11,380
Watch the trees!

2350
02:43:35,279 --> 02:43:36,989
Everyone all right?

2351
02:43:38,407 --> 02:43:41,285
I'm OK! I'm OK!

2352
02:43:41,410 --> 02:43:43,870
Where's Ripley?

2353
02:43:43,996 --> 02:43:45,414
He's dead.

2354
02:43:46,582 --> 02:43:48,458
Watch for Japs!

2355
02:43:57,426 --> 02:43:59,720
- Jap patrols!
- Take cover!

2356
02:44:17,404 --> 02:44:18,697
Who's got magazines?

2357
02:44:18,739 --> 02:44:19,907
Got em!

2358
02:44:20,032 --> 02:44:22,492
Gotta get up into those hills,
find the Chinese!

2359
02:44:27,164 --> 02:44:29,041
They got us pinned down!

2360
02:44:39,927 --> 02:44:42,512
- Danny!
- Rafe! Rafe, no!

2361
02:44:42,638 --> 02:44:44,056
Danny!

2362
02:44:44,181 --> 02:44:45,349
Rafe, you don't have a chance!

2363
02:44:49,228 --> 02:44:51,939
God damn. Danny!

2364
02:44:51,974 --> 02:44:53,357
Come on!

2365
02:44:57,819 --> 02:44:59,036
Gooz? You OK, man?

2366
02:44:59,071 --> 02:45:02,783
Danny? Aw, shit, Anthony.

2367
02:45:02,824 --> 02:45:05,661
Gooz! Can you hear me?

2368
02:45:05,786 --> 02:45:07,746
- Yeah.
- Come on.

2369
02:45:09,122 --> 02:45:11,667
Danny.
Easy, easy, easy.

2370
02:45:11,792 --> 02:45:13,252
I've had better landings.

2371
02:45:13,377 --> 02:45:14,670
You saved us back there.

2372
02:45:14,753 --> 02:45:16,380
I got something in my neck.

2373
02:45:16,421 --> 02:45:18,423
- Let me pull this out.
- Where's Gooz?

2374
02:45:18,548 --> 02:45:20,968
He's fine.
He's right over there.

2375
02:45:38,443 --> 02:45:39,570
Rafe!

2376
02:46:39,922 --> 02:46:41,632
Grenade!

2377
02:46:50,933 --> 02:46:52,476
Danny.

2378
02:46:52,517 --> 02:46:54,353
Danny!

2379
02:46:54,394 --> 02:46:56,647
Danny! Oh!

2380
02:46:59,650 --> 02:47:01,735
- Hold on!
- Rafe!

2381
02:47:01,777 --> 02:47:03,403
Hold on, now. I got you.

2382
02:47:03,528 --> 02:47:06,073
You're all right.
You're all right.

2383
02:47:06,114 --> 02:47:08,659
I'm not gonna make it.

2384
02:47:12,663 --> 02:47:13,956
Oh, yes, you are.

2385
02:47:14,039 --> 02:47:17,501
Yes, you are. Now look at me.

2386
02:47:17,536 --> 02:47:20,963
Rafe, I'm so cold.
I'm so cold.

2387
02:47:21,088 --> 02:47:23,382
You're all right. Hey.

2388
02:47:27,261 --> 02:47:29,680
Hey, Rafe?

2389
02:47:29,721 --> 02:47:31,390
Can you do me a favor?

2390
02:47:31,431 --> 02:47:32,975
What?

2391
02:47:33,100 --> 02:47:37,271
Can you have someone else
write my name on the tombstone?

2392
02:47:37,306 --> 02:47:40,274
You're not gonna die.
Look at me, listen to me!

2393
02:47:40,399 --> 02:47:42,276
You ain't gonna die,
you hear me?

2394
02:47:42,401 --> 02:47:44,278
Danny.

2395
02:47:44,403 --> 02:47:45,661
Danny, you can't die.

2396
02:47:45,696 --> 02:47:47,635
You can't die. You know why?

2397
02:47:47,670 --> 02:47:49,575
'Cause you're gonna be a father.

2398
02:47:49,700 --> 02:47:51,959
You're gonna be a daddy.

2399
02:47:51,994 --> 02:47:56,164
I wasn't supposed to tell you.

2400
02:47:56,290 --> 02:47:58,417
You're gonna be a father.

2401
02:48:00,294 --> 02:48:02,379
Please.

2402
02:48:06,008 --> 02:48:08,010
No. You are.

2403
02:48:17,895 --> 02:48:19,313
Danny.

2404
02:48:21,607 --> 02:48:25,444
Danny?

2405
02:48:25,485 --> 02:48:27,613
Please, please!

2406
02:48:27,648 --> 02:48:29,072
Please.

2407
02:48:32,200 --> 02:48:34,786
God.

2408
02:48:34,912 --> 02:48:37,331
Please, Danny.

2409
02:48:47,633 --> 02:48:50,469
Hold your fire!
They're Chinese.

2410
02:50:11,717 --> 02:50:14,052
When the action is over
and we look back...

2411
02:50:14,136 --> 02:50:18,015
we understand
both more and less.

2412
02:50:18,056 --> 02:50:20,183
This much is certain.

2413
02:50:20,309 --> 02:50:21,852
Before the Doolittle raid...

2414
02:50:21,894 --> 02:50:24,313
America knew nothing
but defeat.

2415
02:50:24,396 --> 02:50:27,608
After it, there was hope of victory.

2416
02:50:27,733 --> 02:50:30,903
Japan realized for the first
time that they could lose...

2417
02:50:30,938 --> 02:50:32,487
and began to pull back.

2418
02:50:32,613 --> 02:50:34,406
America realized
that she would win...

2419
02:50:34,448 --> 02:50:36,450
and surged forward.

2420
02:50:36,617 --> 02:50:39,328
It was a war
that changed America...

2421
02:50:39,329 --> 02:50:40,329
...and the world.

2422
02:50:41,128 --> 02:50:43,213
Dorie Miller was
the first black American...

2423
02:50:43,296 --> 02:50:45,549
to be awarded the Navy Cross.

2424
02:50:45,716 --> 02:50:47,300
But he would not be the last.

2425
02:50:47,426 --> 02:50:49,720
He joined
a brotherhood of heroes.

2426
02:50:56,578 --> 02:50:59,039
That's for all the raiders.

2427
02:51:08,841 --> 02:51:12,136
World War II for us
began at Pearl Harbor...

2428
02:51:12,261 --> 02:51:15,681
and 1,177 men
still lie entombed...

2429
02:51:15,848 --> 02:51:17,683
in the battleship Arizona.

2430
02:51:18,684 --> 02:51:22,980
America suffered...
but America grew stronger.

2431
02:51:23,021 --> 02:51:25,114
It was not inevitable.

2432
02:51:25,149 --> 02:51:27,860
The times tried our souls...

2433
02:51:27,943 --> 02:51:31,321
and through the trial,
we overcame.

2434
02:51:52,384 --> 02:51:53,642
Hey, Danny...

2435
02:51:53,677 --> 02:51:57,681
how'd you like to go flying?

2436
02:51:57,806 --> 02:51:59,683
Come here.

2437
02:53:05,574 --> 02:53:09,369
When I think back
on these times

2438
02:53:09,404 --> 02:53:13,165
And the dreams we left behind

2439
02:53:13,332 --> 02:53:16,168
I'll be glad
'cause I was blessed

2440
02:53:16,203 --> 02:53:20,464
To get to have you in my life

2441
02:53:20,589 --> 02:53:23,884
When I look back on these days

2442
02:53:23,925 --> 02:53:28,347
I'll look and see your face

2443
02:53:28,472 --> 02:53:32,934
You were right there for me

2444
02:53:35,771 --> 02:53:38,648
In my dreams
I'll always see you

2445
02:53:38,683 --> 02:53:43,153
Soar above the sky

2446
02:53:43,236 --> 02:53:47,658
In my heart, there'll
always be a place for you

2447
02:53:47,783 --> 02:53:50,661
For all my life

2448
02:53:50,786 --> 02:53:56,917
I'll keep a part of you
with me

2449
02:53:56,958 --> 02:53:59,920
And everywhere I am

2450
02:53:59,961 --> 02:54:03,590
There you'll be

2451
02:54:03,625 --> 02:54:07,219
And everywhere I am

2452
02:54:07,386 --> 02:54:11,181
There you'll be

2453
02:54:13,558 --> 02:54:17,104
Well, you showed me
how it feels

2454
02:54:17,145 --> 02:54:20,691
Feel the sky with in my reach

2455
02:54:20,816 --> 02:54:24,201
And I always will remember

2456
02:54:24,236 --> 02:54:28,281
All the strength
you gave to me

2457
02:54:28,407 --> 02:54:31,284
Your love made me
make it through

2458
02:54:31,410 --> 02:54:36,060
Oh, I owe so much to you

2459
02:54:36,095 --> 02:54:40,711
You were right there for me

2460
02:54:43,588 --> 02:54:46,550
In my dreams
I'll always see you

2461
02:54:46,717 --> 02:54:51,103
Soar above the sky

2462
02:54:51,138 --> 02:54:53,890
In my heart,
there'll always be

2463
02:54:53,974 --> 02:54:55,559
A place for you

2464
02:54:55,726 --> 02:54:58,729
For all my life

2465
02:54:58,812 --> 02:55:04,818
I'll keep a part of you
with me

2466
02:55:04,860 --> 02:55:07,362
And everywhere I am

2467
02:55:07,397 --> 02:55:09,865
There you'll be

2468
02:55:10,032 --> 02:55:13,452
'Cause I always saw
in you my light

2469
02:55:13,487 --> 02:55:17,164
My strength

2470
02:55:17,205 --> 02:55:19,333
And I want to thank you now

2471
02:55:19,458 --> 02:55:23,628
For all the ways

2472
02:55:23,754 --> 02:55:27,632
You were right there for me

2473
02:55:27,758 --> 02:55:31,178
You were right there for me

2474
02:55:31,219 --> 02:55:35,932
For always

2475
02:55:36,058 --> 02:55:38,894
In my dreams
I'll always see you

2476
02:55:38,935 --> 02:55:43,357
Soar above the sky

2477
02:55:43,482 --> 02:55:45,901
In my heart,
there'll always be

2478
02:55:46,068 --> 02:55:47,653
A place for you

2479
02:55:47,778 --> 02:55:50,947
For all my life

2480
02:55:51,073 --> 02:55:56,828
I'll keep a part of you
with me

2481
02:55:56,953 --> 02:56:00,748
And everywhere I am

2482
02:56:00,783 --> 02:56:04,544
There you'll be

2483
02:56:04,670 --> 02:56:07,381
And everywhere I am

2484
02:56:07,506 --> 02:56:12,219
There you'll be

2485
02:56:12,386 --> 02:56:24,690
There you'll be
