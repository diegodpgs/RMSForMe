1
00:00:46,442 --> 00:00:48,820
<i>1957 was a big year. </i>

2
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,656
<i>The Russians put that Sputnik
into outer space. </i>

3
00:00:51,906 --> 00:00:54,742
<i>The Dodgers played their last game
at Ebbets Field... </i>

4
00:00:54,993 --> 00:00:56,411
<i>... and said goodbye to Brooklyn. </i>

5
00:00:56,661 --> 00:01:00,331
<i>That guy, he shot Frank Costello
in the head and missed. </i>

6
00:01:00,582 --> 00:01:04,752
<i>The Gallo brothers whacked
Albert Anastasia in that barbershop. </i>

7
00:01:05,003 --> 00:01:06,796
<i>It was total chaos. </i>

8
00:01:07,046 --> 00:01:10,633
<i>With Anastasia out, Vito Genovese
figures he's the big boss. </i>

9
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:12,051
<i>But Carlo Gambino... </i>

10
00:01:12,302 --> 00:01:14,512
<i>... and Joe Bananas had other ideas. </i>

11
00:01:14,846 --> 00:01:16,306
<i>So they called a meeting. </i>

12
00:01:16,764 --> 00:01:18,266
<i>A big meeting. </i>

13
00:01:28,276 --> 00:01:32,155
<i>It was the first time the whole
Commission would meet face to face. </i>

14
00:01:32,405 --> 00:01:35,283
<i>Bosses and wiseguys were coming
from all over the country... </i>

15
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:37,493
<i>... and all the
New York families too. </i>

16
00:01:37,744 --> 00:01:40,288
<i>Maybe 50 bosses,
the whole wiseguy world... </i>

17
00:01:40,538 --> 00:01:43,374
<i>... all coming to this
little town upstate. </i>

18
00:01:53,176 --> 00:01:56,554
<i>My father went with Dom Manetta
and Tommy D. Fat Tommy. </i>

19
00:01:56,804 --> 00:01:58,431
<i>He was running the family then. </i>

20
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:02,477
<i>Some asshole thought it would be
a good idea to have this meeting... </i>

21
00:02:02,727 --> 00:02:05,938
<i>... at Joe Barbara 's farm,
up in the country, nice and quiet. </i>

22
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:07,565
Get away from the car.

23
00:02:10,443 --> 00:02:13,821
Want to be a fucking rib eye?
Get away from the car!

24
00:02:15,448 --> 00:02:18,576
<i>Turns out the cops were
watching Joe Barbara like a hawk... </i>

25
00:02:18,826 --> 00:02:23,081
<i>... and some deputy sheriff notices
all the traffic and calls the feds. </i>

26
00:02:35,968 --> 00:02:37,678
<i>The meeting never even
got started. </i>

27
00:02:37,929 --> 00:02:39,347
<i>The feds moved in... </i>

28
00:02:40,223 --> 00:02:42,850
<i>... and bingo, the bosses,
they moved out. </i>

29
00:03:01,494 --> 00:03:06,499
<i>My father and Dominic, they hid out
in the field with some hay or corn. </i>

30
00:03:06,707 --> 00:03:07,875
<i>Along comes a farmer. </i>

31
00:03:08,084 --> 00:03:11,295
<i>Dominic bullshits him
while my father holds out... </i>

32
00:03:11,546 --> 00:03:15,341
<i>... this.44 cannon he used to carry,
and hijacked the tractor. </i>

33
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:19,428
<i>The story is they drove it
to Bensonhurst... </i>

34
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:23,224
<i>... but my father told me they
only got as far as Poughkeepsie. </i>

35
00:03:27,186 --> 00:03:29,564
<i>Anyway, Carlo Gambino came out of it... </i>

36
00:03:29,814 --> 00:03:31,983
<i>...capo di tutti capi,
"boss of all bosses"...</i>

37
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:36,529
<i>... and that was the last time the
Commission tried to meet, until now. </i>

38
00:03:46,038 --> 00:03:48,791
I don't like it.
What do we gotta meet for?

39
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:52,003
Let everybody else worry about
their own business.

40
00:03:52,253 --> 00:03:56,591
he '57 meeting was about how we were
gonna divide this country.

41
00:03:57,091 --> 00:03:59,927
his meeting is how we're
gonna survive.

42
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,057
You got made guys
informing for the feds.

43
00:04:05,308 --> 00:04:06,475
Bosses are going to jail.

44
00:04:07,476 --> 00:04:09,854
People are getting whacked
without permission.

45
00:04:10,104 --> 00:04:12,231
And on top of everything else...

46
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:14,025
...you got these Chinese...

47
00:04:14,442 --> 00:04:16,819
...and these crazy Russians
to deal with.

48
00:04:17,153 --> 00:04:18,779
Everything's changing.

49
00:04:19,405 --> 00:04:21,616
We gotta change with the times.

50
00:04:21,824 --> 00:04:23,909
We gonna get a fucking Website?

51
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,494
When your papa died...

52
00:04:28,205 --> 00:04:31,792
...I made him a promise
that I'd always look out for you.

53
00:04:33,794 --> 00:04:36,339
I want you to come to
that meeting with me.

54
00:04:36,756 --> 00:04:37,840
<i>Capisci? </i>

55
00:04:46,891 --> 00:04:51,145
Listen. His guy, Primo Sindone,
you watch out for him.

56
00:04:51,437 --> 00:04:53,105
He's a scumbag.

57
00:04:53,397 --> 00:04:55,024
Keep your eye on him, okay?

58
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:01,655
Let me get a toothpick.
I'll be back.

59
00:05:30,142 --> 00:05:33,312
<i>I just kept telling him
that I needed room... </i>

60
00:05:33,562 --> 00:05:34,647
...to grow...

61
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:40,277
...and to find myself as a person.

62
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:43,197
You know?
Not just as a woman...

63
00:05:43,656 --> 00:05:46,075
...but as an independent entity.

64
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:50,204
hen I told him I needed to get
in touch with my uniqueness...

65
00:05:50,454 --> 00:05:52,665
...but he could not handle that.

66
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,918
He said that I was
driving him away.

67
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,213
He said I was driving him away.

68
00:06:01,173 --> 00:06:04,009
Do you think I was
driving him away, Dr. Sobel?

69
00:06:06,303 --> 00:06:07,847
Caroline, things end.

70
00:06:08,931 --> 00:06:12,518
It's part of life. It's how we deal
with the ending that's important.

71
00:06:12,768 --> 00:06:13,978
I just cannot believe...

72
00:06:14,228 --> 00:06:16,981
...that it's over between
me and Steve, you know?

73
00:06:17,231 --> 00:06:19,441
I mean, maybe there's still hope.

74
00:06:20,025 --> 00:06:22,153
He took a restraining
order against you.

75
00:06:22,403 --> 00:06:24,780
o be honest,
that's usually not a good sign.

76
00:06:25,364 --> 00:06:27,158
But what should I do?

77
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,372
he first thing that I think
you should do...

78
00:06:33,706 --> 00:06:37,626
...is to stop whining about this
pathetic loser, for chrissakes!

79
00:06:37,877 --> 00:06:39,503
You are a tragedy queen!

80
00:06:39,753 --> 00:06:42,464
Steve doesn't like me.
Steve doesn't respect me.

81
00:06:42,715 --> 00:06:44,800
Who gives a shit?
Get a fucking life!

82
00:06:47,386 --> 00:06:49,096
Dr. Sobel?

83
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,353
I was reflecting on your situation.

84
00:06:56,604 --> 00:06:58,731
It's interesting what
you were saying.

85
00:06:58,981 --> 00:07:00,441
I want you to think about it.

86
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:02,985
And I'm going to think about it.

87
00:07:03,235 --> 00:07:04,612
We'll both think about it...

88
00:07:06,822 --> 00:07:09,700
...and continue next week
when I get back from vacation.

89
00:07:13,787 --> 00:07:15,331
Caroline, what are you feeling?

90
00:07:15,581 --> 00:07:18,167
You're just like Steve.
You just want to...

91
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:19,793
You just want to...

92
00:07:20,044 --> 00:07:21,754
...get rid of me
and throw me out.

93
00:07:22,004 --> 00:07:23,589
You know that's not true.

94
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:24,840
Yes, it's true.

95
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,508
I'll see you next week...

96
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,261
...whereas Steve never wants
to see you again.

97
00:07:38,937 --> 00:07:40,105
Please, Mr. Vitti.

98
00:07:40,356 --> 00:07:42,232
I don't know nothing.
hey don't believe me...

99
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:45,235
...because once I said Joe
hit Dukey and he didn't.

100
00:07:45,486 --> 00:07:48,280
I didn't know because Little Joe
looked like...

101
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,865
Shut the fuck up!

102
00:07:52,117 --> 00:07:53,535
You know me, right?

103
00:07:53,786 --> 00:07:54,745
You're Mr. Vitti.

104
00:07:54,995 --> 00:07:56,955
You know what I'll
do to you if you lie?

105
00:07:57,456 --> 00:08:00,292
You'll crack me on the head
with that pipe.

106
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:02,920
It's a rhetorical question,
you idiot.

107
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,756
I'll ask you only once:
Who killed Dominic?

108
00:08:06,006 --> 00:08:07,591
- Who killed Dominic?
- I don't know!

109
00:08:07,841 --> 00:08:09,885
- Who killed Dominic?
- I don't know!

110
00:08:10,177 --> 00:08:11,095
I swear to God...

111
00:08:11,345 --> 00:08:12,471
Don't fucking lie!

112
00:08:12,721 --> 00:08:14,973
You little motherfucker!
Who killed Dom?

113
00:08:25,484 --> 00:08:27,403
He don't know nothing.
Forget it.

114
00:08:34,243 --> 00:08:36,036
hat was relatively painless.

115
00:08:36,286 --> 00:08:37,246
Shut the fuck up!

116
00:08:38,122 --> 00:08:39,373
hat hurt.

117
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:43,210
We're not going anywhere.

118
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,463
We've sat here for 10 minutes.
I hate being late.

119
00:08:46,713 --> 00:08:48,507
I hate walking into
that house late.

120
00:08:48,757 --> 00:08:49,633
Dad, relax.

121
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:53,137
You're like this because you're
mad we have to go to Grandpa's.

122
00:08:53,387 --> 00:08:54,930
Please don't analyze me.

123
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,559
I can't be analyzed by somebody who,
until recently, believed in Santa.

124
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:01,562
here is one Dr. Sobel
in this family. Just one.

125
00:09:02,396 --> 00:09:05,524
But there's two.
here's you and there's Grandpa.

126
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:09,027
You know what?
Let's talk about something else.

127
00:09:11,196 --> 00:09:13,198
You gonna read
Grandpa's new book?

128
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:16,910
Mom says you won't
because you're jealous.

129
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:21,415
Does your mother talk about anything
else, or is it just me, 24 hours a day?

130
00:09:21,665 --> 00:09:22,624
Shit!

131
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:26,253
his is your mother's fault.
She knows where I am every second.

132
00:09:30,883 --> 00:09:32,050
Get in!

133
00:09:32,301 --> 00:09:35,012
If I point to you,
make believe your neck hurts.

134
00:09:35,804 --> 00:09:36,972
What are you, a moron?

135
00:09:37,264 --> 00:09:38,891
I'm sorry.
his was my fault.

136
00:09:39,141 --> 00:09:40,184
Did you see anything?

137
00:09:40,434 --> 00:09:41,977
- I was talking to my son.
- Bullshit!

138
00:09:42,227 --> 00:09:43,353
hat's all right, sir.

139
00:09:43,604 --> 00:09:46,023
It's our fault for
being in front of you.

140
00:09:46,273 --> 00:09:47,649
No, really.
Listen to me.

141
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,777
I'm responsible.
Here's my insurance information.

142
00:09:51,028 --> 00:09:52,070
It's okay.
Forget it.

143
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:54,156
Forget...?
Your rear end's screwed up.

144
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,409
No, it was like that before.

145
00:09:59,077 --> 00:10:01,079
Let's call the police
and file a report.

146
00:10:01,747 --> 00:10:03,373
Fuck the police.

147
00:10:03,957 --> 00:10:04,791
Hear me?

148
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,587
Okay.
Fuck them.

149
00:10:09,296 --> 00:10:10,881
You're right.
Fuck them.

150
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:14,509
Especially those mounted cops
who leave big piles all over...

151
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,095
...and you just step in it
up to your shins.

152
00:10:17,387 --> 00:10:18,889
Let me give you my card...

153
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:21,767
...in case you look at it
and change your mind.

154
00:10:22,184 --> 00:10:23,143
You a doctor?

155
00:10:23,977 --> 00:10:25,270
I'm a psychiatrist.

156
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,480
A shrink.

157
00:10:26,939 --> 00:10:28,565
I talked to a shrink one time.

158
00:10:28,815 --> 00:10:31,193
When I got sent upstate on a...

159
00:10:31,443 --> 00:10:32,778
...fishing trip.

160
00:10:33,487 --> 00:10:35,322
Jelly!
Let's go! Come on.

161
00:10:36,156 --> 00:10:37,324
I gotta go.

162
00:10:37,991 --> 00:10:39,493
I'll see you.

163
00:10:44,748 --> 00:10:45,832
Pings and knocks.

164
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,085
Cheap gas.
What are you gonna do?

165
00:10:48,377 --> 00:10:50,754
- Right.
- Ake it easy, Doc!

166
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,937
Neurotics only!

167
00:11:07,187 --> 00:11:11,149
<i>Oh, you must have been
a beautiful baby</i>

168
00:11:11,358 --> 00:11:13,777
<i>'Cause baby, look at you now</i>

169
00:11:14,027 --> 00:11:15,487
<i>Thank God for Prozac</i>

170
00:11:15,904 --> 00:11:19,449
<i>Baby, look at you now</i>

171
00:11:22,744 --> 00:11:25,455
You're not coming?
his is my wedding!

172
00:11:25,706 --> 00:11:28,667
We understand it's
a special day for you, Benny...

173
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:31,336
...but we can't just
pick up and leave town...

174
00:11:31,586 --> 00:11:33,588
...every time you decide
to get married.

175
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,924
Every time?
his is a once in a lifetime...

176
00:11:36,174 --> 00:11:38,385
wice in a lifetime thing, Mom.

177
00:11:38,802 --> 00:11:41,471
Dad, you're not coming
to my wedding?

178
00:11:41,722 --> 00:11:44,766
We want to, but I have
three book signings next weekend.

179
00:11:45,016 --> 00:11:47,310
I can't piss off
these big bookstores.

180
00:11:47,644 --> 00:11:50,981
If I cancel, they stick me on the
bottom shelves. Hat's how they are.

181
00:11:51,231 --> 00:11:52,441
hat's the word on the street.

182
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:54,985
Barnes is okay, but Noble is
a vindictive prick.

183
00:11:55,235 --> 00:11:56,778
Ben.
he language.

184
00:11:57,028 --> 00:11:58,238
I'm sorry, but listen.

185
00:11:58,488 --> 00:12:00,574
I have been alone for eight years.

186
00:12:01,032 --> 00:12:04,244
I finally found somebody that
I want to spend my life with.

187
00:12:04,494 --> 00:12:06,788
At least meet her
before we get married.

188
00:12:07,038 --> 00:12:08,665
You are gonna be her family.

189
00:12:08,915 --> 00:12:10,834
I think she should
know that up front.

190
00:12:11,084 --> 00:12:12,586
You're being very hostile.

191
00:12:13,336 --> 00:12:14,546
I was joking.

192
00:12:15,297 --> 00:12:16,673
I'm going to see the mayor.

193
00:12:16,923 --> 00:12:18,633
he mayor is here?

194
00:12:19,718 --> 00:12:20,969
What's wrong?

195
00:12:21,219 --> 00:12:22,762
Nothing.
Everything's fine.

196
00:12:23,054 --> 00:12:24,389
How's your practice?

197
00:12:24,681 --> 00:12:26,725
Excellent.
I have interesting patients.

198
00:12:26,975 --> 00:12:29,853
Very interesting.
Fascinating, actually.

199
00:12:30,103 --> 00:12:32,606
Dad has a patient who
dreams he shits trout.

200
00:12:34,274 --> 00:12:35,525
hanks, Mike.

201
00:12:37,068 --> 00:12:40,405
<i>The Manetta family is bound
to ask questions. </i>

202
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:43,700
hey think we put
the hit out on Dominic.

203
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,036
Forget Dominic.
hey were after Paul.

204
00:12:46,328 --> 00:12:48,705
It's a miracle you survived.
I just thank God.

205
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,832
Yeah, thank God, all right.

206
00:12:51,082 --> 00:12:54,085
If it wasn't because I had to
go back for that toothpick...

207
00:12:54,336 --> 00:12:56,421
...I'd be lying dead with Dominic,
God forbid.

208
00:12:56,713 --> 00:12:57,964
May he rest in peace.

209
00:12:58,215 --> 00:12:59,633
his is about the big meeting.

210
00:12:59,883 --> 00:13:02,219
Primo Sindone wants to
run the whole show.

211
00:13:02,469 --> 00:13:03,929
Primo knows the rules.

212
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:07,807
He couldn't come after them unless
he had permission from the families.

213
00:13:08,058 --> 00:13:11,311
If they did, we're headed for
one big war, I can tell you that.

214
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:14,481
Find out what you can.
We got two weeks.

215
00:13:14,731 --> 00:13:17,484
God forbid the other
New York bosses are against us.

216
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,073
I want to know that
before I go into that meeting.

217
00:13:23,323 --> 00:13:24,199
Sure.

218
00:13:24,616 --> 00:13:26,534
You all right?
You don't look too good.

219
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,704
What's the matter?

220
00:13:30,622 --> 00:13:33,249
I'm a little choked up.
I'm going to get some air.

221
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,709
- Easy.
- Ake some air.

222
00:13:46,471 --> 00:13:47,681
You all right?

223
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:49,849
What?

224
00:13:52,644 --> 00:13:53,603
I feel like shit.

225
00:13:53,853 --> 00:13:56,564
his whole thing is like
one big fucking headache.

226
00:13:56,815 --> 00:13:59,150
<i>You having one of them "mindgraines"?</i>

227
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:07,033
- Let's go.
- What's the matter?

228
00:14:07,283 --> 00:14:08,660
- Just drive.
- What happened?

229
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:23,842
Good news, Mr. Evans.
Your heart is just fine.

230
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,468
<i>"Just fine"?</i>

231
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:28,805
But I had eight heart attacks
in the last three weeks.

232
00:14:29,055 --> 00:14:31,766
Based on everything,
I'd say you had an anxiety attack.

233
00:14:32,016 --> 00:14:33,101
A what?

234
00:14:33,351 --> 00:14:34,978
An anxiety attack.
A panic attack.

235
00:14:35,228 --> 00:14:36,271
I'll give you Xanax.

236
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:38,231
Anxiety?
What are you saying?

237
00:14:38,481 --> 00:14:39,816
It's a common thing.

238
00:14:40,066 --> 00:14:41,651
Hey, look at me.

239
00:14:41,901 --> 00:14:44,237
Do I look like a guy who panics?

240
00:14:46,322 --> 00:14:49,284
- Do I look like a guy who panics?
- It's nothing to be ashamed of.

241
00:14:49,492 --> 00:14:52,871
Where'd you go to medical school?
I got a fucking heart attack.

242
00:14:53,121 --> 00:14:54,748
Not according to your EKG.

243
00:15:07,302 --> 00:15:10,096
Jelly, I need you to do
something for me as a friend.

244
00:15:10,346 --> 00:15:11,181
Yeah, anything.

245
00:15:11,431 --> 00:15:14,517
- Find me a doctor.
- We just come from the doctor.

246
00:15:14,767 --> 00:15:17,061
Not that kind of doctor.
Like a head doctor.

247
00:15:17,312 --> 00:15:19,564
You gonna change your face,
like Sonny Black?

248
00:15:19,814 --> 00:15:21,816
Don't get his nose.
He looks like a pig.

249
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:25,403
Not a plastic surgeon.
I gotta spell everything out for you?

250
00:15:25,653 --> 00:15:27,113
It saves time.

251
00:15:29,157 --> 00:15:32,577
I mean, like a head doctor.
Like a psychiatrist.

252
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,624
his is like one of them psychic,
ESPN...

253
00:15:38,082 --> 00:15:40,251
...ESPN things, you know?

254
00:15:40,668 --> 00:15:44,005
I just ran into a psychiatrist.
Actually, he ran into me.

255
00:15:44,464 --> 00:15:45,590
Was he any good?

256
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:49,802
He seemed like a smart guy.
He had a business card.

257
00:15:50,053 --> 00:15:53,181
A business card?
hat's a real fucking achievement.

258
00:15:58,519 --> 00:15:59,938
What do you need a shrink for?

259
00:16:00,188 --> 00:16:02,065
It's not for me.
It's for my friend.

260
00:16:02,273 --> 00:16:04,734
I'm gonna ask the shrink
some questions...

261
00:16:04,984 --> 00:16:06,778
...and get some answers
for my friend.

262
00:16:07,028 --> 00:16:10,990
Nobody can know. God forbid somebody
hears I been talking to a shrink.

263
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:12,700
It could be interpreted wrong.

264
00:16:12,992 --> 00:16:13,993
Know what I mean?

265
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:16,204
No one will ever know.

266
00:16:16,454 --> 00:16:18,998
- Could I just ask one question?
- Go ahead.

267
00:16:19,499 --> 00:16:20,708
his friend...

268
00:16:21,584 --> 00:16:22,502
...is it me?

269
00:16:25,213 --> 00:16:26,214
Yeah, it's you.

270
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:32,679
Carl, I'm detecting a pattern.
You settle too easily for things.

271
00:16:33,096 --> 00:16:35,098
You're right.
I do.

272
00:16:36,641 --> 00:16:38,309
See, you just did it again.

273
00:16:38,685 --> 00:16:41,396
I suggested something,
and you immediately agreed.

274
00:16:42,397 --> 00:16:43,815
You're right.
I did.

275
00:16:44,065 --> 00:16:45,358
Why do you do this?

276
00:16:45,608 --> 00:16:47,068
I don't know.

277
00:16:47,735 --> 00:16:50,530
I think it's your fear
of rejection or disapproval.

278
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,032
You don't have to
worry about that.

279
00:16:53,282 --> 00:16:55,118
Be your own man.
Stand your ground.

280
00:16:55,368 --> 00:16:57,954
You don't have to
let people roll over you.

281
00:16:58,204 --> 00:16:59,038
Dr. Sobel?

282
00:16:59,288 --> 00:17:00,373
We're in session.

283
00:17:00,623 --> 00:17:02,625
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.

284
00:17:04,252 --> 00:17:06,212
You're the guy I hit last night.

285
00:17:06,462 --> 00:17:08,381
Bingo.
Get out of here.

286
00:17:08,923 --> 00:17:11,217
Upsy-daisy.
Got a coat, nutbar?

287
00:17:11,467 --> 00:17:12,510
- What...?
- He's leaving.

288
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,555
He's not going till
he's done with his session.

289
00:17:15,805 --> 00:17:17,974
- I'll give you $ 100 to leave.
- Don't take it.

290
00:17:18,224 --> 00:17:19,475
- Make it 150.
- Listen.

291
00:17:19,726 --> 00:17:20,727
300.

292
00:17:21,352 --> 00:17:23,062
He ain't that fucking crazy.

293
00:17:23,896 --> 00:17:25,481
You were right.
I stood my ground.

294
00:17:25,732 --> 00:17:27,900
- His was the wrong time.
- I got him up from 150.

295
00:17:28,151 --> 00:17:29,902
- I'm proud.
- I feel like a new man.

296
00:17:30,153 --> 00:17:31,320
I'm so happy.

297
00:17:31,571 --> 00:17:34,699
I know you're upset about the car,
but you can't come in here.

298
00:17:34,949 --> 00:17:36,951
his is a patient's private session.

299
00:17:40,496 --> 00:17:41,330
You know me?

300
00:17:41,581 --> 00:17:43,040
- Yes.
- No, you don't.

301
00:17:47,253 --> 00:17:49,046
You seen my picture
in the paper?

302
00:17:49,297 --> 00:17:50,506
- Yes.
- No, you didn't.

303
00:17:50,757 --> 00:17:52,508
I don't even get the paper.

304
00:17:58,264 --> 00:17:59,766
Jelly, wait outside.

305
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:02,143
Sit down.

306
00:18:08,274 --> 00:18:09,859
You ain't got no bugs in here?

307
00:18:10,109 --> 00:18:10,902
Bugs?

308
00:18:11,152 --> 00:18:13,070
Bugs.
Recording equipment.

309
00:18:13,738 --> 00:18:16,491
No, I don't record.
I take notes.

310
00:18:18,576 --> 00:18:21,621
I tried to give him the insurance
information several times.

311
00:18:21,871 --> 00:18:22,997
Several times.

312
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:24,415
He wouldn't take it.

313
00:18:24,665 --> 00:18:25,917
Please don't kill me.

314
00:18:26,626 --> 00:18:29,253
I was just gonna ask
if you like ony Bennett.

315
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:32,423
I'm a big ony Bennett fan.

316
00:18:33,341 --> 00:18:34,258
Me too.

317
00:18:34,509 --> 00:18:36,427
I like all Italian singers.

318
00:18:37,512 --> 00:18:39,889
Mr. Vitti,
I know it's not your fault...

319
00:18:40,139 --> 00:18:42,892
...but shouldn't we take this up
with our insurance companies?

320
00:18:43,142 --> 00:18:45,394
hat ain't it.
I don't care about the car.

321
00:18:45,645 --> 00:18:47,647
I got a friend of mine...

322
00:18:47,897 --> 00:18:51,859
He's got problems, and he'll
have to probably see a shrink.

323
00:18:52,109 --> 00:18:53,819
So I'll ask you
a couple of questions.

324
00:18:54,654 --> 00:18:55,988
Go ahead, then.

325
00:18:58,032 --> 00:18:59,951
What do we do?
What, we sit?

326
00:19:00,201 --> 00:19:01,911
Whatever makes you comfortable.

327
00:19:02,161 --> 00:19:03,246
I'll sit over here.

328
00:19:05,414 --> 00:19:06,874
- I'll sit here.
- Hat's your...

329
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,335
If you're comfortable,
it's fine.

330
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,301
So who starts?

331
00:19:18,928 --> 00:19:20,972
Tell me why you think
you need therapy.

332
00:19:21,681 --> 00:19:24,976
I don't need therapy.
I told you that. It's for my friend.

333
00:19:25,226 --> 00:19:26,978
- I'm sorry.
- You didn't hear me?

334
00:19:27,228 --> 00:19:28,062
I'm sorry.

335
00:19:28,312 --> 00:19:32,275
You're supposed to be good at listening.
You can't remember what I said?

336
00:19:32,525 --> 00:19:33,651
So sorry.

337
00:19:33,901 --> 00:19:37,363
I ain't thrilled with the
level of service up to this point.

338
00:19:37,613 --> 00:19:39,490
hat was my fault.
I apologize.

339
00:19:41,075 --> 00:19:43,119
Why don't we start over?

340
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:46,247
Why don't you just tell me
about your friend?

341
00:19:48,374 --> 00:19:51,877
his friend, you know,
he's a very powerful guy.

342
00:19:52,378 --> 00:19:53,921
Never had trouble
with nothing.

343
00:19:54,171 --> 00:19:56,465
All of a sudden,
he's falling apart...

344
00:19:56,716 --> 00:19:59,593
...he cries for no reason,
he can't sleep...

345
00:19:59,844 --> 00:20:01,554
...he can't be with his friends.

346
00:20:01,804 --> 00:20:04,181
All of a sudden,
he gets nervous around them.

347
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:05,933
He wants to get away from them.

348
00:20:06,183 --> 00:20:09,186
And these are guys he knows
his whole life, you know?

349
00:20:09,437 --> 00:20:11,355
And then he has these attacks.

350
00:20:12,606 --> 00:20:15,693
He can't breathe,
he gets dizzy...

351
00:20:16,402 --> 00:20:18,195
...chest pains, you know...

352
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:21,115
He thinks he's going to
die or something.

353
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:22,491
Panic attacks.

354
00:20:22,742 --> 00:20:24,535
What's with you guys
and panic attacks?

355
00:20:24,785 --> 00:20:26,245
<i>Who said "panic"?</i>

356
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,621
<i>Who said "panic"?</i>

357
00:20:27,872 --> 00:20:28,873
Not panic.

358
00:20:29,123 --> 00:20:31,667
Dizzy, chest-breathing,
constricting...

359
00:20:32,293 --> 00:20:33,669
...attacks.

360
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,548
his guy, he just wants to know
what he can do to make it stop.

361
00:20:41,886 --> 00:20:44,138
I'm gonna go out on a limb here.

362
00:20:45,222 --> 00:20:47,349
I think your friend...

363
00:20:48,225 --> 00:20:49,435
...is you.

364
00:20:59,195 --> 00:21:01,072
You got a gift, my friend.

365
00:21:01,322 --> 00:21:03,032
You got a gift.

366
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:07,953
You saw that there was something
I was trying to do...

367
00:21:08,204 --> 00:21:10,748
...and figured it out.
hat's why you are who you are.

368
00:21:11,415 --> 00:21:13,125
God bless you.
You got a fucking gift.

369
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,502
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

370
00:21:14,752 --> 00:21:17,087
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

371
00:21:18,714 --> 00:21:19,840
Go on.

372
00:21:20,341 --> 00:21:21,759
- What?
- Go on.

373
00:21:22,635 --> 00:21:23,844
I think...

374
00:21:25,095 --> 00:21:26,305
...medication could help.

375
00:21:26,555 --> 00:21:27,807
Drugs?

376
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,767
Can't do drugs.
I don't do drugs.

377
00:21:31,101 --> 00:21:33,479
If you want to get to
the root of the problem...

378
00:21:33,729 --> 00:21:35,523
...you'll want to get
some form of therapy.

379
00:21:35,773 --> 00:21:37,691
Like what?
With you or something?

380
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:41,028
Me?
No, I don't think you want...

381
00:21:42,071 --> 00:21:43,948
My roster of patients is full.

382
00:21:44,198 --> 00:21:47,785
I'm full right now.
Plus, I'm leaving on a short vacation.

383
00:21:48,035 --> 00:21:48,953
Where you going?

384
00:21:49,453 --> 00:21:51,622
- I don't share that with patients.
- Where?

385
00:21:51,872 --> 00:21:54,458
Sheraton Bal Harbour Hotel
in Miami Beach.

386
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,168
hat wasn't so hard, was it?

387
00:21:56,418 --> 00:21:57,878
No, it wasn't.

388
00:22:01,173 --> 00:22:03,592
You know, it's a funny
kind of a thing...

389
00:22:03,842 --> 00:22:07,012
...but I feel better after
I got all that off my chest.

390
00:22:07,263 --> 00:22:08,806
I feel like a load...

391
00:22:09,056 --> 00:22:10,975
A load is off my shoulders.

392
00:22:12,017 --> 00:22:13,143
You're good.

393
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:15,187
Doc, thank you.

394
00:22:16,397 --> 00:22:17,982
- I didn't do anything.
- You did.

395
00:22:18,232 --> 00:22:19,441
- I did nothing.
- You did too.

396
00:22:19,692 --> 00:22:21,986
he load, gone.
Where is it?

397
00:22:22,236 --> 00:22:23,529
Don't know.

398
00:22:24,488 --> 00:22:25,948
You're good.

399
00:22:26,448 --> 00:22:28,242
You're good, Doc.

400
00:22:28,576 --> 00:22:30,536
I'll be getting in touch with you.

401
00:22:30,786 --> 00:22:33,080
- Don't, please.
- One more thing.

402
00:22:33,455 --> 00:22:37,960
If I talk to you, and you turn me
into a fag, I'll kill you. Understand?

403
00:22:39,378 --> 00:22:41,839
<i>Could we define "fag"?
Because some feelings...</i>

404
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:44,300
- I go fag, you die. Got it?
- Got it.

405
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,509
Simple.

406
00:22:46,677 --> 00:22:47,845
You're good, Doc.

407
00:22:48,345 --> 00:22:49,596
You're good.

408
00:22:51,932 --> 00:22:53,183
See you, Doc.

409
00:23:06,405 --> 00:23:09,616
We take on Manetta,
what does Vitti do? Nothing.

410
00:23:09,867 --> 00:23:12,328
- Why doesn't he move?
- Fuck him.

411
00:23:12,578 --> 00:23:15,414
<i>You say "fuck him, "
but he's planning something big.</i>

412
00:23:15,664 --> 00:23:16,707
he shit's coming down.

413
00:23:16,957 --> 00:23:18,584
hen let it come down.

414
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:20,669
Let me tell you,
Vitti's a tough guy...

415
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:24,590
...but a lot of tough guys get fed to
the crabs off Red Hook.

416
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:28,344
Vitti. Hat name has been
haunting me since I was a kid.

417
00:23:28,594 --> 00:23:31,430
Growing up, he was the smart guy.
I was the dope.

418
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,725
My father was a nickel-and-dime
shitheel. His had it all.

419
00:23:34,975 --> 00:23:37,144
Vito Genovese blew it at Apalachin...

420
00:23:37,394 --> 00:23:40,355
...because he forgot to kill
Gambino before the meeting.

421
00:23:40,606 --> 00:23:43,525
I won't make that same mistake.
I want Paul Vitti dead!

422
00:23:43,776 --> 00:23:47,404
You hear me? I want him dead.
Not breathing now. Dead!

423
00:23:49,823 --> 00:23:50,783
Like the pants?

424
00:23:51,575 --> 00:23:53,243
hey look great.
He's some tailor.

425
00:23:53,494 --> 00:23:55,037
I'll tell you. Look good.

426
00:23:55,287 --> 00:23:56,121
I like them.

427
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:04,421
Don't leave any food in your room.
I won't come home to a science fair.

428
00:24:04,671 --> 00:24:06,090
I didn't.

429
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,509
Dad, one thing, though.

430
00:24:09,551 --> 00:24:10,928
<i>- "I go fag, you die. "
- Hat's it!</i>

431
00:24:11,178 --> 00:24:12,763
I'm sealing the vent
in your room.

432
00:24:13,013 --> 00:24:14,681
You cannot listen to my sessions!

433
00:24:14,932 --> 00:24:17,476
It's so cool.
Was that really Paul Vitti?

434
00:24:17,726 --> 00:24:20,938
I didn't ask to see his
Mafia decoder ring, but yes.

435
00:24:21,188 --> 00:24:24,608
- Are you going to treat him?
- Of course not. Are you crazy?

436
00:24:25,692 --> 00:24:28,695
You cannot tell anybody
that he was here. Understand?

437
00:24:28,946 --> 00:24:30,656
Should I take it off the Internet?

438
00:24:30,906 --> 00:24:31,949
I'm kidding.

439
00:24:40,082 --> 00:24:44,253
<i>Despite the heat and the popularity of
more exotic Caribbean destinations... </i>

440
00:24:44,503 --> 00:24:47,589
<i>... Florida 's hospitality industry

445

On a personal note,
this is my last report for WVBF.

446
00:25:01,728 --> 00:25:04,481
I'm marrying a wonderful man
and moving to New York.

447
00:25:04,773 --> 00:25:06,400
<i>Thanks for everything, Miami. </i>

448
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:10,487
<i>For the last time, this is
Laura MacNamara for WVBF. </i>

449
00:25:12,322 --> 00:25:13,240
Catch!

450
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:17,202
We're clear!
Nice, Laura.

451
00:25:25,711 --> 00:25:28,630
Everybody! His is him!
his is the guy!

452
00:25:29,548 --> 00:25:31,967
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you too.

453
00:25:32,217 --> 00:25:34,344
- Michael, say hi.
- Hi, Laura.

454
00:25:34,595 --> 00:25:36,805
Hi, Michael.
How are you?

455
00:25:37,764 --> 00:25:39,516
You want to go
look at the camera?

456
00:25:39,766 --> 00:25:41,935
Why would I want to go
look at the camera?

457
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:46,356
- Is it okay?
- Yeah, go ahead.

458
00:25:46,607 --> 00:25:49,776
Don't worry if you break anything.
I'm out of here.

459
00:25:51,236 --> 00:25:54,489
- You think he likes me?
- He's crazy about you. No, he is.

460
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,783
I love you.
I'm so glad to be with you.

461
00:25:57,159 --> 00:25:59,411
Do you really?
And do you really love me?

462
00:25:59,661 --> 00:26:01,622
Of course.
What's the matter?

463
00:26:02,414 --> 00:26:04,249
- I'm nervous.
- Why?

464
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:07,336
Because I'm going to be
a stepmom to a grown kid...

465
00:26:07,586 --> 00:26:08,879
...and we're getting married.

466
00:26:09,129 --> 00:26:10,922
So what are you worried about?

467
00:26:11,173 --> 00:26:12,799
What if you get tired of me?

468
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:15,886
A lot of couples are very happy,
and then they marry...

469
00:26:16,136 --> 00:26:18,388
...and completely lose interest
in each other.

470
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,390
hat won't happen to us.

471
00:26:35,822 --> 00:26:37,449
Is everything okay, Paul?

472
00:26:37,699 --> 00:26:40,243
Will you stop talking?
I'm trying to do this here.

473
00:26:41,703 --> 00:26:44,790
- You seem distracted.
- I am. I got things on my mind.

474
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,167
- Would you stop talking?
- I'm sorry.

475
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:48,460
Lie down.

476
00:26:51,922 --> 00:26:53,173
hinking about your wife?

477
00:26:53,423 --> 00:26:56,927
I wasn't thinking about my wife.
What are you talking about?

478
00:27:07,437 --> 00:27:09,022
Now I am thinking about my wife.

479
00:27:09,272 --> 00:27:11,900
Sheila, why can't you
keep your mouth shut?

480
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,068
Sorry.

481
00:27:20,534 --> 00:27:21,827
Dr. Sobel.

482
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,833
Mom?

483
00:27:31,753 --> 00:27:32,963
It's me.

484
00:27:33,213 --> 00:27:35,882
Mr. Vitti wants to see you.
I got your robe.

485
00:27:37,926 --> 00:27:42,347
I got news for you, you two-bit prick,
son-of-a-bitch rat bastard...

486
00:27:42,597 --> 00:27:45,600
...you did nothing for me!
Whatever you did, it didn't take.

487
00:27:45,851 --> 00:27:48,103
I'm still fucked up.
You did nothing for me!

488
00:27:48,353 --> 00:27:51,648
I did nothing for you?
I saw you for five minutes.

489
00:27:51,898 --> 00:27:53,149
What do you expect?

490
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,695
I can't work miracles.
Let me tell you something else.

491
00:27:57,028 --> 00:27:59,281
I don't like it when someone
breaks in...

492
00:27:59,531 --> 00:28:01,533
...and kidnaps me
in the middle of the night!

493
00:28:01,783 --> 00:28:03,326
I have a family.
I have a life.

494
00:28:03,577 --> 00:28:05,203
And I have a serious practice.

495
00:28:05,453 --> 00:28:07,998
And I don't have time
for your bullshit!

496
00:28:08,874 --> 00:28:10,959
hat got away from me
at the end there.

497
00:28:14,045 --> 00:28:15,714
I couldn't get it up last night.

498
00:28:16,923 --> 00:28:18,091
Do you mean sexually?

499
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,135
No, for the big
Michigan State game.

500
00:28:20,385 --> 00:28:22,679
Of course, sexually!
What's the matter with you?

501
00:28:23,013 --> 00:28:24,264
Can I get this straight?

502
00:28:24,514 --> 00:28:27,851
You flew 1,500 miles,
you dragged me out of bed...

503
00:28:28,143 --> 00:28:30,186
...because you couldn't get
an erection?

504
00:28:30,437 --> 00:28:32,522
Don't that prove I'm motivated?

505
00:28:32,898 --> 00:28:34,566
You can take a pill for that.

506
00:28:34,816 --> 00:28:35,692
hat's a cheat.

507
00:28:35,942 --> 00:28:38,403
You start with the pills,
next it's hydraulics.

508
00:28:38,653 --> 00:28:41,573
A hard-on should be gotten
legitimately or not at all.

509
00:28:41,823 --> 00:28:43,533
I think Mark wain said that.

510
00:28:43,825 --> 00:28:45,952
Are you gonna help me or not?

511
00:28:47,078 --> 00:28:49,289
I don't believe this.
All right.

512
00:28:51,082 --> 00:28:52,334
Has this happened before?

513
00:28:52,584 --> 00:28:54,127
he dead-dick thing?

514
00:28:55,253 --> 00:28:57,797
Never.
Well, one time. Last night.

515
00:28:58,757 --> 00:28:59,758
One more time.

516
00:29:00,008 --> 00:29:00,842
So twice.

517
00:29:01,092 --> 00:29:02,886
Do the math.
wo times.

518
00:29:03,845 --> 00:29:06,890
hen another time, but after
a big meal, so that don't count.

519
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,060
Being unable to perform
three or four times is not...

520
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,478
Eight times.

521
00:29:12,062 --> 00:29:13,730
Eight times is not catastrophic.

522
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,649
Maybe not to you.
Look at you.

523
00:29:16,524 --> 00:29:19,569
But if I can't get it up,
that makes me less of a man.

524
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:21,696
In my world,
I deal with animals.

525
00:29:21,946 --> 00:29:24,699
hey may seem dumb to
an educated guy like you...

526
00:29:24,949 --> 00:29:27,994
...but animals are very cunning,
and they sense weakness.

527
00:29:28,745 --> 00:29:30,038
I got less than two weeks...

528
00:29:30,288 --> 00:29:32,832
...to get strong, or they'll kill me.

529
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:34,084
What happens then?

530
00:29:34,334 --> 00:29:36,294
I can't tell you.
You don't want to know.

531
00:29:36,544 --> 00:29:39,672
You can't tell me and I don't
want to know. Hat's a big help.

532
00:29:39,923 --> 00:29:41,841
You're supposed to tell me.
I want to know.

533
00:29:42,092 --> 00:29:44,427
hat's how this works.
his is impossible.

534
00:29:44,677 --> 00:29:47,764
I can't do anything in two weeks,
and even if I could...

535
00:29:48,014 --> 00:29:51,267
...what is my goal? O make you
a happy, well-adjusted gangster?

536
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:54,270
he other day I was watching
a V commercial...

537
00:29:54,562 --> 00:29:56,231
...some kid playing with puppies.

538
00:29:56,481 --> 00:29:58,274
I cried for 45 minutes.

539
00:29:58,608 --> 00:30:00,443
Slap a pair of tits on me, I'm a woman.

540
00:30:00,693 --> 00:30:01,736
I can't help you.

541
00:30:01,986 --> 00:30:03,113
You're turning me down?

542
00:30:03,363 --> 00:30:07,492
When I got into family therapy,
this wasn't the family I had in mind.

543
00:30:07,742 --> 00:30:12,163
You with your schmucky little office
and house, you're turning me down?

544
00:30:12,414 --> 00:30:14,749
So you can listen to
housewives piss and moan...

545
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:17,085
...about nobody fucks them
right anymore?

546
00:30:17,335 --> 00:30:18,586
I'm leaving now.

547
00:30:18,837 --> 00:30:19,838
You see this?

548
00:30:20,088 --> 00:30:21,756
his is what I'm talking about.

549
00:30:22,006 --> 00:30:23,550
I'm a dead man.

550
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:29,264
You call yourself a doctor.
You should be ashamed of yourself.

551
00:30:30,765 --> 00:30:35,061
A real doctor could never turn his back
on a person who's suffering!

552
00:30:35,895 --> 00:30:40,525
You couldn't treat a fucking
two-celled amoeba, you fucking phony.

553
00:30:44,154 --> 00:30:47,323
Mother of God, give me
the strength to get through this.

554
00:30:48,074 --> 00:30:49,325
his fucking rat bastard...

555
00:30:49,576 --> 00:30:50,952
...won't help me.

556
00:30:52,745 --> 00:30:56,499
I cry all the time...
Don't know what it is.

557
00:30:57,167 --> 00:30:58,376
All right, here.

558
00:31:00,962 --> 00:31:02,088
Sit down.

559
00:31:05,842 --> 00:31:07,010
Sit down.

560
00:31:11,431 --> 00:31:13,600
What happened with
your wife last night?

561
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:16,311
I wasn't with my wife.
I was with my girlfriend.

562
00:31:16,561 --> 00:31:18,187
Are you having marriage problems?

563
00:31:18,897 --> 00:31:20,315
Why do you have a girlfriend?

564
00:31:20,565 --> 00:31:22,066
You're moralizing with me now?

565
00:31:22,317 --> 00:31:24,736
No, I'm curious.
Why do you have a girlfriend?

566
00:31:24,986 --> 00:31:27,196
I do things with her
I can't do with my wife.

567
00:31:27,447 --> 00:31:28,781
Why can't you?

568
00:31:29,032 --> 00:31:32,368
hat's the mouth she kisses
my kids with. Are you crazy?

569
00:31:34,746 --> 00:31:36,497
Have you been under stress lately?

570
00:31:36,748 --> 00:31:39,751
- Like seeing your best friend murdered?
- Hat would qualify.

571
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:41,794
I got a lot of stress.

572
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:48,843
Based upon what you told me before
about the attacks...

573
00:31:49,093 --> 00:31:50,803
...I'd say that was probably it.

574
00:31:51,888 --> 00:31:53,514
<i>- Just stress?
- "Just stress"?</i>

575
00:31:53,765 --> 00:31:55,516
Stress is a very powerful force.

576
00:31:55,767 --> 00:31:58,645
I doubt there's anything
physically wrong with you.

577
00:31:58,895 --> 00:32:00,772
- Hat's it?
- Hat's it.

578
00:32:01,814 --> 00:32:02,857
hat's it?

579
00:32:03,107 --> 00:32:04,025
I think so.

580
00:32:06,736 --> 00:32:08,071
You're very good, you.

581
00:32:08,321 --> 00:32:09,572
You are very good.

582
00:32:09,822 --> 00:32:11,908
- Here's more to it...
- You're very good.

583
00:32:12,158 --> 00:32:14,118
- Here are underlying...
- Understand me?

584
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:15,745
You're right on the money.

585
00:32:15,995 --> 00:32:18,539
I feel the juices rush back
to my balls as we speak.

586
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,209
I never thought I'd hear
a man say that to me.

587
00:32:21,459 --> 00:32:23,628
hat settles it.
You are my shrink.

588
00:32:23,878 --> 00:32:25,296
No, I couldn't.

589
00:32:25,546 --> 00:32:27,006
You're not ready to open up.

590
00:32:27,256 --> 00:32:29,008
You're not a good candidate...

591
00:32:29,258 --> 00:32:32,261
Listen to you.
he fucking honesty.

592
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,721
hat's it.
You don't understand.

593
00:32:33,971 --> 00:32:36,307
Nobody, nobody talks
to me like that.

594
00:32:36,557 --> 00:32:37,975
You understand?

595
00:32:38,226 --> 00:32:39,644
- Yes, I do.
- Hat's it.

596
00:32:39,894 --> 00:32:40,937
Let's do it.
I'm ready.

597
00:32:41,187 --> 00:32:43,064
<i>You don't hear the word "no"
very often.</i>

598
00:32:43,314 --> 00:32:46,567
<i>I hear it all the time,
only it's more, "No, please, no, no. "</i>

599
00:32:47,235 --> 00:32:48,820
I'm here for two more days.

600
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:52,281
When I get back to New York,
I'll treat you exclusively.

601
00:32:52,532 --> 00:32:53,783
For two weeks.

602
00:32:54,617 --> 00:32:56,577
I just don't know what
to tell my patients.

603
00:32:56,828 --> 00:32:58,454
You want me to clear
your schedule?

604
00:32:58,704 --> 00:33:01,541
It would be my honor to do that.
My pleasure.

605
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,168
Not Jimmy.
I will do this myself.

606
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:05,503
- You sure?
- Positive.

607
00:33:05,753 --> 00:33:07,380
I will see you in New York.

608
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:10,591
Okay.
Want one of them?

609
00:33:10,842 --> 00:33:11,843
- No, thanks.
- Sure?

610
00:33:12,093 --> 00:33:14,053
hat's very kind of you, but I...

611
00:33:14,303 --> 00:33:16,389
<i>Want to give a little sta minch?</i>

612
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,307
You sure?

613
00:33:19,308 --> 00:33:20,601
he pause that refreshes.

614
00:33:20,852 --> 00:33:22,478
I don't...
No, I really...

615
00:33:22,854 --> 00:33:23,771
You're on vacation.

616
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:25,857
I'm also about to get married...

617
00:33:26,107 --> 00:33:28,526
...so I'd like to go back
to my hotel and...

618
00:33:28,776 --> 00:33:29,610
Good night.

619
00:33:29,861 --> 00:33:31,070
I'll see you in New York.

620
00:33:31,404 --> 00:33:33,865
You.
Hey, Doc. You.

621
00:33:34,574 --> 00:33:35,992
I'm gonna see a lot of you.

622
00:33:38,703 --> 00:33:39,954
Where were you?

623
00:33:40,204 --> 00:33:42,123
My God, I woke up
and you were gone!

624
00:33:42,373 --> 00:33:45,001
here was no note or anything!
I was out of my mind!

625
00:33:45,251 --> 00:33:47,461
I walked all over the hotel
looking for you.

626
00:33:47,712 --> 00:33:50,673
I even ate a Rice Krispy reat.
I almost called the police.

627
00:33:50,923 --> 00:33:53,801
No, don't call the police.
I'll tell you the truth.

628
00:33:54,051 --> 00:33:55,928
I had a patient emergency.

629
00:33:56,179 --> 00:33:58,181
You have patients in Florida?

630
00:33:58,431 --> 00:34:02,143
One. He followed me from New York.
I had to go, trust me.

631
00:34:02,393 --> 00:34:04,312
My God.
Who is this patient?

632
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:07,773
Paul Vitti.

633
00:34:12,069 --> 00:34:13,571
Mafia Paul Vitti?

634
00:34:15,948 --> 00:34:17,867
Oh, my God.

635
00:34:20,661 --> 00:34:23,122
It's not like
he's a regular patient.

636
00:34:23,372 --> 00:34:24,665
He's got problems.

637
00:34:25,458 --> 00:34:28,252
He thinks that I'm treating him.
It's crazy.

638
00:34:28,502 --> 00:34:29,921
So you're not treating him?

639
00:34:30,171 --> 00:34:31,339
Tell me you're not.

640
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:32,757
I'm not treating him.

641
00:34:33,007 --> 00:34:36,052
It's scary. You don't want
someone like that in your life.

642
00:34:36,302 --> 00:34:39,096
I've covered the mob down here.
I've seen what they do.

643
00:34:39,347 --> 00:34:42,391
He and I spoke about it.
He understood. It's over.

644
00:34:42,642 --> 00:34:44,810
- You're sure?
- Absolutely.

645
00:34:46,979 --> 00:34:48,689
I was so worried.

646
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,942
I thought maybe you
got scared or...

647
00:34:51,192 --> 00:34:53,152
...saw an ex-girlfriend
or something.

648
00:34:53,486 --> 00:34:55,154
Well, I don't know.

649
00:34:56,113 --> 00:34:57,531
- I love you.
- I love you.

650
00:34:57,782 --> 00:35:00,993
I'm sorry, but everything's
going to be okay.

651
00:35:04,288 --> 00:35:06,290
<i>Give her a big hand!
Let's hear it! </i>

652
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,917
<i>How about that? </i>

653
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:15,257
hat was great!
Come on, get into it.

654
00:35:15,925 --> 00:35:17,969
I don't understand.
hey splash in the water.

655
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:19,261
hey eat fish.

656
00:35:19,512 --> 00:35:21,138
his is not a big stretch
for a whale.

657
00:35:21,389 --> 00:35:22,348
Stop it.

658
00:35:22,598 --> 00:35:24,350
We're having fun, right?

659
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:27,770
I'm not having as much fun
as it looks like I am.

660
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,773
I'm pretending, because we
have to bond and all.

661
00:35:35,569 --> 00:35:39,782
<i>A little snack for her
might be 50 pounds of mackerel. </i>

662
00:35:42,368 --> 00:35:43,703
<i>There she goes! </i>

663
00:35:47,456 --> 00:35:50,209
I'm going to get a hot dog.
Anybody want anything?

664
00:35:50,459 --> 00:35:51,919
- I'll go with you.
- It's fine.

665
00:35:52,169 --> 00:35:54,964
You're pretending to have a good time.
I don't want to spoil that.

666
00:35:55,214 --> 00:35:56,424
I'll be right back.

667
00:35:56,674 --> 00:35:58,759
You think those whales
piss in that water?

668
00:35:59,009 --> 00:36:03,013
I think they use the men's room
next door to the Burger King.

669
00:36:03,222 --> 00:36:04,098
Dummy.

670
00:36:04,348 --> 00:36:06,517
- What's going on?
- Mr. Vitti wants to see you.

671
00:36:06,767 --> 00:36:07,810
Is this a joke?

672
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,311
You're employed
by Mr Vitti...

673
00:36:09,562 --> 00:36:11,981
...which means you're on call
24 hours a day...

674
00:36:12,231 --> 00:36:13,649
...just like the rest of us.

675
00:36:13,899 --> 00:36:15,234
I'm sorry.
He and I discussed...

676
00:36:15,484 --> 00:36:18,612
We discussed this, and I agreed
to see him in New York.

677
00:36:18,863 --> 00:36:19,697
hat's it.

678
00:36:19,947 --> 00:36:22,825
Doctor, listen to me.
It is what it is.

679
00:36:23,075 --> 00:36:27,037
If he wants you sooner, you go sooner.
hat's it.

680
00:36:27,288 --> 00:36:28,497
No.
I am not going.

681
00:36:28,747 --> 00:36:31,250
And if either one of you
bother me again...

682
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,918
...I won't treat him at all.

683
00:36:33,169 --> 00:36:35,045
<i>Do you understand that?
Capisci? </i>

684
00:36:35,296 --> 00:36:37,631
It's over!
End of story.

685
00:36:39,008 --> 00:36:41,218
Look at the size of this one.

686
00:36:41,635 --> 00:36:43,637
Jesus Christ!

687
00:36:45,473 --> 00:36:46,849
It's feeding time.

688
00:36:49,101 --> 00:36:51,228
hey threw me in
the shark tank, Paul.

689
00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:52,730
hey wanted to make a point.

690
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,065
hat you're scary?
Believe me, I get it.

691
00:36:55,316 --> 00:36:56,150
You're in a mood.

692
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,986
I get that way when
a shark tries to chew on my ass.

693
00:36:59,236 --> 00:37:01,864
- We had an agreement.
- We did, but I had an episode.

694
00:37:02,114 --> 00:37:05,075
I didn't have a panic attack,
but I started panicking...

695
00:37:05,326 --> 00:37:07,328
...thinking I might get one.
Is that weird?

696
00:37:07,578 --> 00:37:10,206
<i>I am redefining "weird"
on an hourly basis.</i>

697
00:37:10,456 --> 00:37:12,208
<i>-What's he doing?
- I don't know.</i>

698
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:14,877
<i>- He's talking with some guy.
-Can you hit him? </i>

699
00:37:15,127 --> 00:37:18,172
He's got fat Jelly and his
partner Jimmy Boots with him.

700
00:37:18,422 --> 00:37:21,383
I could do it with a rifle,
but I don't have that with me.

701
00:37:21,634 --> 00:37:22,676
<i>Just get him. </i>

702
00:37:22,927 --> 00:37:24,970
You told me to take care of him,
I will.

703
00:37:25,221 --> 00:37:27,264
What were you thinking
when you got anxious?

704
00:37:27,514 --> 00:37:29,808
Let's get out of here.
We're being watched.

705
00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:32,770
Don't look.
here's feds up there watching us.

706
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,688
How do you know that?

707
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,607
I'm a criminal.
It's my job.

708
00:37:37,816 --> 00:37:38,943
Who's the new face?

709
00:37:40,653 --> 00:37:43,113
<i>Maybe he's Vitti's new consigliere. </i>

710
00:37:43,364 --> 00:37:46,367
Whoever this guy is,
he must be important to the family.

711
00:37:46,617 --> 00:37:49,328
Put his picture on the wire.
See what you come up with.

712
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:57,836
Normally, a patient wouldn't have
a vat of scotch during a session.

713
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:03,509
<i>hat's interesting. I'll have to
remember it if I'm ever on Jeopardy. </i>

714
00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:05,052
Tell me about your father.

715
00:38:05,302 --> 00:38:07,888
My father.
Well, my father...

716
00:38:08,138 --> 00:38:09,598
Let's sit here.

717
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,642
My father.

718
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,396
A big man in the neighborhood.
Everybody loved him.

719
00:38:15,646 --> 00:38:17,564
Very well-respected,
God rest his soul.

720
00:38:17,815 --> 00:38:19,233
He passed away?

721
00:38:19,483 --> 00:38:22,444
<i>I just like saying "God rest his soul. "
Of course he passed away!</i>

722
00:38:22,695 --> 00:38:24,363
I was about 12 at the time.

723
00:38:24,613 --> 00:38:25,864
How did he die?

724
00:38:26,365 --> 00:38:28,534
It was a sudden thing.
A heart attack.

725
00:38:28,784 --> 00:38:31,120
How was the relationship?
Were you close?

726
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:32,621
We were pretty close.

727
00:38:32,871 --> 00:38:35,040
We weren't getting along great
right then.

728
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:36,458
Why is that?

729
00:38:36,834 --> 00:38:39,586
<i>I was hanging out in the neighborhood.
I had a borgata. </i>

730
00:38:40,087 --> 00:38:40,963
What is that?

731
00:38:41,213 --> 00:38:43,674
A kid gang, nothing big.
But he didn't like that.

732
00:38:43,924 --> 00:38:44,925
He didn't approve.

733
00:38:45,175 --> 00:38:47,678
He slapped me around
a couple of times.

734
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,096
And what?

735
00:38:49,346 --> 00:38:50,639
And then he died.

736
00:38:51,223 --> 00:38:53,016
How'd that make you feel?

737
00:38:53,267 --> 00:38:55,728
It felt great, wonderful.
How'd it make me feel?

738
00:38:55,978 --> 00:38:56,979
hink about it.

739
00:38:57,229 --> 00:39:00,357
Were you angry?
Were you afraid? Sad?

740
00:39:00,607 --> 00:39:02,526
Maybe all those things.

741
00:39:02,776 --> 00:39:04,027
Any feelings of guilt?

742
00:39:04,486 --> 00:39:05,946
About what?
I didn't kill him.

743
00:39:06,196 --> 00:39:07,823
I know that.
I'm just speculating...

744
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,952
...that maybe in some way
you may have wanted him to die.

745
00:39:12,202 --> 00:39:13,662
Why would I want him to die?

746
00:39:13,912 --> 00:39:16,790
You said you were fighting.
He slapped you around...

747
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,209
...because you rebelled
against his authority.

748
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,211
Maybe some unresolved
Oedipal conflict.

749
00:39:21,462 --> 00:39:23,130
English, English.

750
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:27,134
Oedipus was a Greek king who killed
his father and married his mother.

751
00:39:27,384 --> 00:39:28,427
Fucking Greeks.

752
00:39:28,677 --> 00:39:30,971
It's an instinctual
developmental drive.

753
00:39:31,221 --> 00:39:33,223
he young boy wants to
replace his father...

754
00:39:33,474 --> 00:39:35,934
...so that he can
totally possess his mother.

755
00:39:36,185 --> 00:39:38,353
Are you saying
I wanted to fuck my mother?

756
00:39:38,604 --> 00:39:39,605
It's a primal fantasy.

757
00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:41,690
Have you ever seen my mother?

758
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,984
- Are you out of your mind?
- It's Freud!

759
00:39:44,234 --> 00:39:47,154
Freud's a sick fuck, and you are
too for bringing it up.

760
00:39:50,866 --> 00:39:54,203
<i>Can I be honest?
I don 't think I can call you Dad. </i>

761
00:39:54,453 --> 00:39:57,080
So what do I call you?
Do I call you Scott?

762
00:39:57,331 --> 00:39:59,041
My friends call me Captain.

763
00:39:59,917 --> 00:40:01,210
Captain?

764
00:40:02,836 --> 00:40:05,380
Want another drink?
I'm definitely having eight or nine.

765
00:40:05,631 --> 00:40:06,924
I'd like a morphine and soda.

766
00:40:07,883 --> 00:40:09,384
I'm shaking.

767
00:40:09,927 --> 00:40:13,430
Shall we go to our table?
Come on, Michael.

768
00:40:15,265 --> 00:40:16,558
<i>Seor Sobel.</i>

769
00:40:19,978 --> 00:40:21,230
How you doing?

770
00:40:22,814 --> 00:40:23,815
It's the Vittis.

771
00:40:24,566 --> 00:40:25,609
My God.

772
00:40:27,945 --> 00:40:30,906
Everybody's happy.
Everybody's smiling. His is nice.

773
00:40:31,323 --> 00:40:32,991
You're Paul Vitti,
the mobster.

774
00:40:34,785 --> 00:40:36,286
Now, is that polite?

775
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,373
Is that being nice?
I'm trying to be nice.

776
00:40:39,623 --> 00:40:42,626
Do I walk up to you and say
you're so-and-so, the hard-on?

777
00:40:43,585 --> 00:40:45,712
his is Laura's father,
the Captain.

778
00:40:45,963 --> 00:40:47,714
I'm very, very sorry.

779
00:40:47,965 --> 00:40:49,091
Excuse us.

780
00:40:51,593 --> 00:40:53,595
I heard about the wedding.
Here you go.

781
00:40:53,845 --> 00:40:57,099
A little something for the
bride and groom. God bless.

782
00:40:57,474 --> 00:40:58,558
We can't accept this.

783
00:40:58,809 --> 00:41:00,310
- Yes, you can.
- Hank you.

784
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,064
I'm just gonna borrow this guy.
I'll bring him right back.

785
00:41:04,314 --> 00:41:05,983
And then you'll leave us alone.

786
00:41:06,233 --> 00:41:07,651
I'll leave you alone.

787
00:41:07,901 --> 00:41:09,152
I got to talk to you.

788
00:41:10,946 --> 00:41:12,614
wo minutes.
wo minutes.

789
00:41:12,864 --> 00:41:15,450
Wait over there.
Don't listen to what we say.

790
00:41:15,701 --> 00:41:17,077
My ears are sealed.

791
00:41:17,327 --> 00:41:19,162
I had a weird dream
last night.

792
00:41:19,413 --> 00:41:22,374
I feel like I'm having one now.
Why'd you interrupt my party?

793
00:41:22,624 --> 00:41:25,127
You're really very rigid
about certain things.

794
00:41:25,377 --> 00:41:26,670
Did you know that?

795
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,214
All right,
tell me about your dream.

796
00:41:29,464 --> 00:41:31,049
I'm asleep.

797
00:41:31,299 --> 00:41:33,844
I hear a baby crying.
I go to the refrigerator.

798
00:41:34,094 --> 00:41:35,595
I get him a bottle of milk.

799
00:41:35,846 --> 00:41:37,597
I bring the bottle of milk to him...

800
00:41:37,848 --> 00:41:39,141
...I see the milk is black.

801
00:41:39,391 --> 00:41:40,934
hat's fucking weird!

802
00:41:41,184 --> 00:41:42,019
Get out of here.

803
00:41:42,269 --> 00:41:43,979
- Get out of here.
- Sorry.

804
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:48,025
What does that mean?
And no more filth about my mother.

805
00:41:48,275 --> 00:41:50,193
I don't know.
What does it mean to you?

806
00:41:51,153 --> 00:41:54,239
his is why I pay you? I say
something, you say it back to me?

807
00:41:54,489 --> 00:41:56,658
I could get Jelly to
do that for nothing.

808
00:41:56,908 --> 00:41:59,494
Get Jelly.
I'm going back to my party.

809
00:42:01,455 --> 00:42:03,540
All right.
I'm letting it go this time.

810
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:06,877
Because you're getting married,
I'm gonna let it go.

811
00:42:10,672 --> 00:42:14,634
Why don't you look over that way
before I bust your head open?

812
00:42:28,523 --> 00:42:31,818
I'm gonna grab a bite to eat.
You want a sandwich?

813
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,446
What kind of sandwich
ain't too fattening?

814
00:42:34,696 --> 00:42:36,239
A half a sandwich.

815
00:42:36,782 --> 00:42:38,700
I'll be back in a few minutes.

816
00:43:09,564 --> 00:43:12,234
Now, nod your head and smile.
Do it.

817
00:43:13,109 --> 00:43:14,778
Now, you listen to me, goombah.

818
00:43:15,028 --> 00:43:17,906
I know what your game is,
and you'd better call it quits.

819
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,868
<i>If you and your paisans
do anything to hurt my little girl...</i>

820
00:43:22,118 --> 00:43:23,662
...I don't care who
you are...

821
00:43:23,912 --> 00:43:27,207
...I'll hunt you down like
the dog you are, and I'll kill you.

822
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:28,792
Understand?

823
00:43:29,167 --> 00:43:30,961
Now, nod and smile.

824
00:43:31,461 --> 00:43:32,712
Congratulations.

825
00:43:36,383 --> 00:43:37,509
What was that about?

826
00:43:37,759 --> 00:43:40,762
Just guy stuff between
me and the Captain.

827
00:44:46,536 --> 00:44:47,579
Shit!

828
00:44:50,832 --> 00:44:53,418
In sickness and in health,
from this day forth...

829
00:44:53,668 --> 00:44:55,795
...as long as you both shall live?

830
00:45:04,929 --> 00:45:07,474
Bring Marie and
the kids right to the airport.

831
00:45:07,724 --> 00:45:11,478
Pull the car in the
back of the hotel and wait for us.

832
00:45:11,728 --> 00:45:12,645
You got it, boss.

833
00:45:12,896 --> 00:45:15,523
hat's it. Hat is it!
I've had it with you.

834
00:45:15,774 --> 00:45:16,775
- What happened?
- What happened?

835
00:45:17,025 --> 00:45:20,862
I just saw a man fall seven stories
into a platter of poached salmon!

836
00:45:21,112 --> 00:45:22,906
- Did he break anything?
- Everything!

837
00:45:23,156 --> 00:45:24,824
hey're still pulling capers
out of him.

838
00:45:25,075 --> 00:45:28,870
People get depressed, they jump.
It's a tragedy, but it ain't my fault.

839
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,705
You're telling me
it was a suicide?

840
00:45:30,955 --> 00:45:33,416
I think he left a note.
Jelly, did they find it?

841
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:35,585
No, but they will in a minute.

842
00:45:35,835 --> 00:45:37,921
<i>Let me guess what it says.
"Life is bullshit.</i>

843
00:45:38,213 --> 00:45:40,423
<i>I can't take it no more.
Signed, he Dead Guy. "</i>

844
00:45:40,673 --> 00:45:42,634
hat's good, Doc.

845
00:45:42,884 --> 00:45:45,011
Enough talk.
We gotta get out of here.

846
00:45:45,261 --> 00:45:46,846
here's feds all over.

847
00:45:47,096 --> 00:45:48,932
I'm going back to New York...

848
00:45:49,182 --> 00:45:51,976
...and I would suggest that
you do the same thing.

849
00:45:52,227 --> 00:45:53,978
Because they're probably
onto you too.

850
00:45:54,229 --> 00:45:56,189
Onto me?
What are you talking about?

851
00:45:56,439 --> 00:45:59,859
Being an accessory to a murder
wasn't part of our understanding.

852
00:46:00,109 --> 00:46:01,694
I didn't kill nobody.

853
00:46:01,945 --> 00:46:03,780
I can't speak for
other people here.

854
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:05,031
He tried to kill me.

855
00:46:05,281 --> 00:46:07,951
God forbid he did that
to somebody in my family.

856
00:46:08,201 --> 00:46:10,495
It would've been
a double or a triple tragedy.

857
00:46:10,745 --> 00:46:13,039
rust me, in this case,
we're the good guys.

858
00:46:13,289 --> 00:46:14,415
Where is he?

859
00:46:15,542 --> 00:46:17,836
- Where are you going?
- Don't touch me.

860
00:46:18,962 --> 00:46:20,380
How could you do that?

861
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:22,423
Another country heard from.

862
00:46:23,007 --> 00:46:24,008
Wait downstairs.

863
00:46:24,259 --> 00:46:27,470
Why? Are they going to throw me
off the balcony too?

864
00:46:28,012 --> 00:46:30,515
You're upset, and
you're upsetting me.

865
00:46:30,765 --> 00:46:31,808
Of course I'm upset!

866
00:46:32,058 --> 00:46:35,353
My wedding is ruined
because you've got problems!

867
00:46:35,603 --> 00:46:36,646
I got problems?

868
00:46:37,397 --> 00:46:38,231
Honey, please.

869
00:46:39,232 --> 00:46:42,068
I'm going to pack,
and then I'm going to New York.

870
00:46:42,318 --> 00:46:45,238
And I am getting married with you
or without you!

871
00:46:45,947 --> 00:46:47,991
With! With!
I'm sorry, honey.

872
00:46:48,241 --> 00:46:50,034
It'll all work out.
I promise.

873
00:46:50,285 --> 00:46:51,619
Please?

874
00:46:52,495 --> 00:46:54,122
No, I hate you!

875
00:46:55,748 --> 00:46:57,750
Are you happy?
Are you happy?

876
00:46:58,001 --> 00:47:00,295
You know what you did?
You ruined my life!

877
00:47:00,545 --> 00:47:02,422
Happy?
What are you talking about?

878
00:47:02,672 --> 00:47:04,882
You think I wanted this?
I'm a victim here.

879
00:47:05,133 --> 00:47:06,467
I can't believe this guy.

880
00:47:06,718 --> 00:47:08,970
He tries to kill me,
then whacks one of my guys.

881
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:12,682
On top of that, he fucks up your
wedding. You know how upset I am?

882
00:47:12,932 --> 00:47:15,643
I'm so enraged, I don't know
what to do with myself!

883
00:47:15,893 --> 00:47:18,354
Plus, I'm trying to
get out of this hotel and...

884
00:47:18,604 --> 00:47:20,231
Are you listening to yourself?

885
00:47:20,481 --> 00:47:21,649
Listen to yourself!

886
00:47:21,899 --> 00:47:26,029
his has been a disaster from the
moment you stepped foot in my office.

887
00:47:26,279 --> 00:47:28,906
hat is it. Over!
I'm no longer your doctor.

888
00:47:29,157 --> 00:47:30,325
Just because of this?

889
00:47:30,575 --> 00:47:33,870
Because of this little double homicide?
Yes, because of this!

890
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,582
You don't have a shred
of human decency. Not a shred.

891
00:47:37,832 --> 00:47:39,751
I actually thought
I could help you.

892
00:47:40,001 --> 00:47:42,462
here's no helping you.
You're a common thug!

893
00:47:42,712 --> 00:47:44,339
Nobody in the world
could help you!

894
00:47:44,589 --> 00:47:46,174
All right!
What do you want me to do?

895
00:47:51,387 --> 00:47:52,847
<i>Let me speak to Primo. </i>

896
00:47:53,097 --> 00:47:53,973
Hold on.

897
00:47:56,434 --> 00:47:58,102
Paul Vitti's on the phone.

898
00:48:08,571 --> 00:48:09,822
<i>-Who is this?
- It's me.</i>

899
00:48:10,073 --> 00:48:12,158
<i>-Me who?
- Me who... Me, me.</i>

900
00:48:12,408 --> 00:48:15,119
<i>-Me? Me who?
- Me, me. You know me. Me.</i>

901
00:48:15,787 --> 00:48:17,038
Yeah, how's it going?

902
00:48:17,288 --> 00:48:18,414
<i>Not good.
Not good. </i>

903
00:48:18,664 --> 00:48:21,626
Whoever did that thing to
you-know-who, my good friend...

904
00:48:21,876 --> 00:48:23,252
...is trying to do that to me.

905
00:48:23,503 --> 00:48:25,922
<i>And I'm having a lot
of feelings about that. </i>

906
00:48:26,214 --> 00:48:28,633
And I'm trying to get some...

907
00:48:28,883 --> 00:48:31,010
- Closure.
- Closure on that.

908
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,597
What kind of feelings?

909
00:48:34,847 --> 00:48:37,767
I'm very angry.
I'm feeling very angry about that.

910
00:48:39,393 --> 00:48:40,561
I'm enraged.

911
00:48:40,812 --> 00:48:43,022
I'm feeling very,
very mad about that.

912
00:48:43,272 --> 00:48:44,482
Why are you telling me?

913
00:48:44,732 --> 00:48:46,109
Why am I telling you?

914
00:48:46,359 --> 00:48:48,444
Like you don't know
nothing about it?

915
00:48:48,694 --> 00:48:50,071
You don't know nothing?
What?

916
00:48:50,488 --> 00:48:52,323
I don't know what
you're talking about.

917
00:48:52,573 --> 00:48:54,158
- I'm trying to...
- Ell you how I feel.

918
00:48:54,408 --> 00:48:56,911
ell you about my feelings
and that...

919
00:48:57,245 --> 00:48:58,621
- I'm angry.
- I'm angry.

920
00:48:58,871 --> 00:49:00,206
And anger is a...

921
00:49:00,456 --> 00:49:02,166
- A blocked wish.
- A blocked wish.

922
00:49:02,416 --> 00:49:05,670
<i>And I'm looking forward to seeing
you next week at that thing. </i>

923
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,464
hen I can unblock
that angered wish...

924
00:49:08,714 --> 00:49:09,632
...and then hopefully...

925
00:49:09,882 --> 00:49:12,343
You make one more move on me,
you motherfucker...

926
00:49:12,593 --> 00:49:14,512
...I'll fucking cut
your fucking balls off!

927
00:49:14,762 --> 00:49:18,099
I'll shove them up your fucking ass!
I'll fucking bury you!

928
00:49:18,349 --> 00:49:21,352
I'll put ice picks in your eyes!
I'll chop your eyeballs!

929
00:49:21,602 --> 00:49:24,313
I'll send them to your family
to eat for dessert!

930
00:49:24,564 --> 00:49:25,898
<i>You understand me? </i>

931
00:49:26,732 --> 00:49:28,025
<i>- What?
-Fuck you. </i>

932
00:49:28,276 --> 00:49:30,069
You motherfucker!

933
00:49:32,822 --> 00:49:35,867
<i>You get a dictionary and find out
what this "closure" is.</i>

934
00:49:36,117 --> 00:49:40,246
If that's what he's going to hit us
with, I want to know what it is.

935
00:49:40,496 --> 00:49:41,831
How was that?

936
00:49:42,498 --> 00:49:44,125
It was going great until...

937
00:49:44,375 --> 00:49:47,086
...the cutting off of the balls
and shoving it up...

938
00:49:47,336 --> 00:49:48,588
...his ass.

939
00:49:48,963 --> 00:49:52,008
You know what I do when I'm mad?
I hit a pillow.

940
00:49:52,258 --> 00:49:53,968
Just hit the pillow.
See how you feel.

941
00:49:59,015 --> 00:50:00,808
here's your fucking pillow.

942
00:50:01,976 --> 00:50:03,144
Feel better?

943
00:50:04,937 --> 00:50:06,147
Yeah, I do.

944
00:50:06,397 --> 00:50:07,648
Good.

945
00:50:22,371 --> 00:50:25,166
Call the Vatican.
See if something is missing.

946
00:50:25,499 --> 00:50:26,834
So cool!

947
00:50:29,003 --> 00:50:31,547
I need to talk to your dad
in private, okay?

948
00:50:31,797 --> 00:50:33,549
Would you unload the car, please?

949
00:50:33,799 --> 00:50:36,594
It's almost as tall as the house.

950
00:50:39,847 --> 00:50:41,474
What is going on?

951
00:50:41,932 --> 00:50:43,309
What is this?

952
00:50:44,185 --> 00:50:45,561
Why?

953
00:50:45,978 --> 00:50:48,814
It's a wedding gift.
He felt bad for the...

954
00:50:49,065 --> 00:50:53,069
Well, we're not married,
so we can just send it back.

955
00:50:55,654 --> 00:50:57,740
It was not my fault.
Everybody was there.

956
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:00,701
You didn't want to
go ahead with the ceremony.

957
00:51:00,951 --> 00:51:04,914
What did you expect? Hat's not what
I want for an anniversary memory.

958
00:51:05,164 --> 00:51:08,501
Look at our wedding video.
here are your parents, and mine.

959
00:51:08,751 --> 00:51:11,003
here's the guy that
plunged to his death.

960
00:51:11,253 --> 00:51:13,381
I just want to marry you.

961
00:51:14,215 --> 00:51:15,841
I'm thinking it'll never happen.

962
00:51:16,092 --> 00:51:18,886
It's happening next Saturday
at the Waldorf.

963
00:51:19,136 --> 00:51:20,346
And who'll be there?

964
00:51:20,596 --> 00:51:21,847
We three, the clergyman...

965
00:51:22,098 --> 00:51:25,601
...and any of your family who
are done with their crisis counseling.

966
00:51:25,851 --> 00:51:28,354
No guests without necks.
Everybody has to have a neck.

967
00:51:28,604 --> 00:51:30,773
We will do a neck check
at the door.

968
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,820
Any furniture you want
to change in the house...

969
00:51:37,071 --> 00:51:38,364
Dr. Sobel.

970
00:51:38,614 --> 00:51:39,448
Ma'am.

971
00:51:39,698 --> 00:51:42,409
I'm Agent Steadman.
Agent Ricci, Agent Provano...

972
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,537
...Federal Bureau
of Investigation, OCD.

973
00:51:44,787 --> 00:51:46,664
Obsessive-compulsive disorder?

974
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:49,792
Organized Crime Division.
We need to talk.

975
00:51:50,042 --> 00:51:52,336
FBI? His is cooler
than the fountain!

976
00:51:52,586 --> 00:51:53,671
Go to your room.

977
00:51:53,921 --> 00:51:55,714
- But I just...
- Go to your room.

978
00:51:56,048 --> 00:51:58,551
Fine. I can hear
better in there anyway.

979
00:51:59,593 --> 00:52:00,928
Please.

980
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:07,393
Can you explain these photographs?

981
00:52:14,692 --> 00:52:18,696
Yes. I'm a psychotherapist.
Paul Vitti is my patient.

982
00:52:18,946 --> 00:52:21,615
- Was your patient.
- Was my patient, yeah.

983
00:52:21,824 --> 00:52:24,034
- Not even like a patient.
- Right. Exactly.

984
00:52:24,243 --> 00:52:26,328
So why did he send you
that fountain?

985
00:52:27,621 --> 00:52:29,123
he fountain?

986
00:52:30,749 --> 00:52:31,959
hat was a...

987
00:52:32,751 --> 00:52:36,130
hat was a gift to
celebrate the completion...

988
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:37,673
...of the therapy.

989
00:52:37,923 --> 00:52:40,092
I got a television
from a kleptomaniac...

990
00:52:40,342 --> 00:52:42,678
...so it's not really
that big of a deal.

991
00:52:42,928 --> 00:52:45,180
Let me cut to the chase,
Dr. Sobel.

992
00:52:46,307 --> 00:52:50,019
Next week the heads of every major
crime family in the U. S...

993
00:52:50,269 --> 00:52:52,354
...will meet somewhere
in the New York area.

994
00:52:52,605 --> 00:52:55,399
We think the stage is set
for a major bloodbath.

995
00:52:55,649 --> 00:52:56,942
Has he mentioned it to you?

996
00:52:57,192 --> 00:52:58,527
A bloodbath?

997
00:53:00,654 --> 00:53:02,740
He has not mentioned
anything like that.

998
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:05,075
I would've remembered that.

999
00:53:05,326 --> 00:53:08,287
<i>"Bloodbath" is something that
sticks out in a conversation.</i>

1000
00:53:08,537 --> 00:53:12,499
You could really help us by supplying
information about that meeting.

1001
00:53:13,626 --> 00:53:15,377
If I don't?

1002
00:53:15,628 --> 00:53:16,629
If you don't...

1003
00:53:17,504 --> 00:53:20,382
...I will personally make
your life a living hell.

1004
00:53:24,261 --> 00:53:27,431
<i>Pauly, I don 't mean this
in a disrespectful way. </i>

1005
00:53:28,223 --> 00:53:30,976
You know I was
a good friend to your father.

1006
00:53:31,226 --> 00:53:33,479
I'll always be
a good friend to you.

1007
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,900
But the word is out that
you're talking to a shrink.

1008
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:39,026
Is that right?

1009
00:53:39,276 --> 00:53:40,277
What's the point here?

1010
00:53:40,569 --> 00:53:43,697
he point is this concerns
the whole family.

1011
00:53:44,448 --> 00:53:47,451
Right now, we're the only ones
that know about it.

1012
00:53:47,701 --> 00:53:50,537
If this ever gets out in the street,
we're dead.

1013
00:53:50,788 --> 00:53:52,665
Who knows what
you're saying to him?

1014
00:53:52,915 --> 00:53:55,376
It ain't nobody's
fucking business.

1015
00:53:55,626 --> 00:53:56,835
I beg to differ.

1016
00:53:57,086 --> 00:54:00,923
If you're looking to establish an
insanity plea for later on...

1017
00:54:01,173 --> 00:54:02,466
...that's okay.

1018
00:54:02,883 --> 00:54:06,136
But everybody'll think you're
falling apart. It's not right.

1019
00:54:06,387 --> 00:54:08,764
hey'll think this is
a sign of weakness.

1020
00:54:09,014 --> 00:54:11,892
Sindone will take over everything.
Is that what you want?

1021
00:54:12,142 --> 00:54:13,769
What do you want me to do?

1022
00:54:14,436 --> 00:54:15,854
It's time to end it, Paul.

1023
00:54:16,105 --> 00:54:17,439
What do you mean, end it?

1024
00:54:17,689 --> 00:54:19,983
Get rid of the shrink.
He knows too much.

1025
00:54:20,234 --> 00:54:22,528
You want me to whack my doctor?
Are you crazy?

1026
00:54:23,529 --> 00:54:26,573
Paul, if you don't do it,
somebody else will.

1027
00:54:26,824 --> 00:54:28,367
hat's the way it is.

1028
00:54:28,951 --> 00:54:30,411
Nobody touches this guy.

1029
00:54:30,661 --> 00:54:33,997
Anybody lays a finger on him,
I'll kill him. Understood?

1030
00:54:38,377 --> 00:54:41,839
- I'm gonna get some fruit.
- I'll wait in the car.

1031
00:54:48,929 --> 00:54:50,597
Can I get some of these?

1032
00:55:25,299 --> 00:55:26,425
Papa!

1033
00:55:29,928 --> 00:55:31,805
Papa! Papa!

1034
00:55:47,654 --> 00:55:49,072
I'm sorry.

1035
00:55:49,448 --> 00:55:50,407
Sorry.

1036
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:01,293
You look lousy.
You all right?

1037
00:56:01,543 --> 00:56:05,672
Yeah, I'm all right. Listen, Paul,
don't send me any more gifts.

1038
00:56:05,923 --> 00:56:10,260
- You didn't like the fountain?
- It's a boundary issue.

1039
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:13,347
If more people gave from the heart,
we'd all be better off.

1040
00:56:13,597 --> 00:56:16,934
Let me see your watch.
Piece of junk. You're getting a Rolex.

1041
00:56:17,184 --> 00:56:19,811
- Don't buy me one.
- Who said anything about buying?

1042
00:56:20,062 --> 00:56:22,356
Paul, listen.
I really have to talk to you.

1043
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,241
Who is that?

1044
00:56:34,576 --> 00:56:38,705
ommy Angels. We grew up together.
Worked for a crew out of Jersey City.

1045
00:56:39,331 --> 00:56:40,540
How did he die?

1046
00:56:43,168 --> 00:56:45,962
He was on his way to talk
to a federal prosecutor.

1047
00:56:46,213 --> 00:56:48,048
Got hit by a truck.

1048
00:56:48,674 --> 00:56:49,966
wice.

1049
00:56:50,717 --> 00:56:51,885
I don't need to know this.

1050
00:56:52,135 --> 00:56:53,345
I can't hear this.

1051
00:56:54,596 --> 00:56:57,432
his is too much for me.
I'm having nightmares myself.

1052
00:56:57,683 --> 00:57:00,727
he other night, I dreamed we
were walking down the street...

1053
00:57:00,977 --> 00:57:02,437
...and I stopped to buy fruit.

1054
00:57:02,688 --> 00:57:05,232
Out of nowhere, two guys
come and they kill me...

1055
00:57:05,524 --> 00:57:08,694
<i>...like Marlon Brando
in The Godfather. </i>

1056
00:57:09,736 --> 00:57:12,114
Good scene. What'd I do?

1057
00:57:12,364 --> 00:57:13,490
You drop your gun.

1058
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:17,244
<i>You run up to me and you
yell, "Papa! Papa! "</i>

1059
00:57:17,619 --> 00:57:18,995
I was Fredo?

1060
00:57:19,496 --> 00:57:21,081
I don't think so.

1061
00:57:22,582 --> 00:57:25,502
You're starting to lose it.
You may need therapy yourself.

1062
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:27,671
We really have to talk.

1063
00:57:30,382 --> 00:57:32,217
We're running out of time.

1064
00:57:50,777 --> 00:57:51,945
he widow.

1065
00:57:52,404 --> 00:57:53,780
I'm very sorry.

1066
00:57:55,115 --> 00:57:56,199
he daughter.

1067
00:57:56,491 --> 00:57:57,659
I'm sorry.

1068
00:58:00,662 --> 00:58:01,746
Brother.

1069
00:58:01,997 --> 00:58:03,623
My condolences.

1070
00:58:09,629 --> 00:58:11,089
I'm very sorry.

1071
00:58:29,024 --> 00:58:30,483
Him, I don't know.

1072
00:58:35,906 --> 00:58:37,490
Can we talk now?

1073
00:58:42,329 --> 00:58:45,707
Don't you see? You called me Papa.
his is all about your father.

1074
00:58:45,957 --> 00:58:47,500
You're nuts.
hat's your dream.

1075
00:58:47,751 --> 00:58:50,128
But the black-milk dream
is also about your father.

1076
00:58:50,378 --> 00:58:53,340
I don't buy that. In my dream,
I'm bringing the baby the black milk.

1077
00:58:53,590 --> 00:58:56,009
Freud believed you're everyone
in your dreams.

1078
00:58:56,259 --> 00:58:58,136
Fuck Freud.
After what you told me...

1079
00:58:58,386 --> 00:59:00,847
...I'm afraid to call
my mother on the telephone.

1080
00:59:01,097 --> 00:59:03,308
Listen, just try to
go with me here.

1081
00:59:03,558 --> 00:59:05,644
Let's just say that you are the baby.

1082
00:59:05,894 --> 00:59:07,729
What kind of milk did
your father bring?

1083
00:59:07,979 --> 00:59:09,856
Could we stop talking about
my father?

1084
00:59:10,523 --> 00:59:13,151
hat's the point. We have to
talk about your father.

1085
00:59:13,401 --> 00:59:15,654
It is so hard to...
You know what you're like?

1086
00:59:15,904 --> 00:59:17,822
<i>"Doc, you got to help me.</i>

1087
00:59:18,073 --> 00:59:19,616
<i>I'm in pain.
Please help me. "</i>

1088
00:59:19,866 --> 00:59:22,577
<i>"All right, Paul, I'll help. "
"Fuck you. Nobody helps me. "</i>

1089
00:59:22,827 --> 00:59:24,871
All right, very good. His is you:

1090
00:59:25,121 --> 00:59:27,374
<i>"hat's interesting.
What does that mean to you?</i>

1091
00:59:27,999 --> 00:59:29,334
<i>Anger is a blocked wish. "</i>

1092
00:59:29,584 --> 00:59:31,544
Boo-fucking-hoo-hoo.

1093
00:59:31,795 --> 00:59:33,838
- Let's talk about your father.
- Let's not.

1094
00:59:34,089 --> 00:59:35,298
What does your father do?

1095
00:59:35,548 --> 00:59:36,591
It's not important.

1096
00:59:36,841 --> 00:59:38,885
- What? You paused.
- I did not.

1097
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:42,097
You just paused. Hat means you
had a feeling. A thought.

1098
00:59:42,347 --> 00:59:44,307
What does your father do?
What's he do?

1099
00:59:44,683 --> 00:59:46,935
- He's a psychiatrist.
- A psychiatrist?

1100
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:51,648
Now I know why you're fucked up.
Next patient, please.

1101
00:59:52,023 --> 00:59:53,316
We are running out of time.

1102
00:59:53,566 --> 00:59:56,236
- Let's not waste it on my problems.
- Your father's a problem?

1103
00:59:56,903 --> 00:59:57,987
- Hat's what you said.
- I did not!

1104
00:59:58,238 --> 00:59:59,239
Now you're upset.

1105
00:59:59,531 --> 01:00:00,365
I am not upset!

1106
01:00:00,615 --> 01:00:01,741
- Yes, you are.
- Stop it!

1107
01:00:01,991 --> 01:00:03,159
I'm getting good at this!

1108
01:00:04,244 --> 01:00:07,539
We only have a few days left.
his is very important stuff.

1109
01:00:07,789 --> 01:00:09,708
hat's why you're acting like this.

1110
01:00:09,958 --> 01:00:12,001
If you want to screw around,
I can't help you.

1111
01:00:12,335 --> 01:00:13,920
Call me when you get serious.

1112
01:00:14,504 --> 01:00:16,172
I am serious.

1113
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:19,592
Don't you want to analyze me no more?

1114
01:00:21,219 --> 01:00:22,554
Say hello to your father.

1115
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:30,437
<i>It's time to end it, Paul. </i>

1116
01:00:30,812 --> 01:00:31,730
<i>What do you mean? </i>

1117
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:34,482
<i>Get rid of the shrink.
He knows too much already. </i>

1118
01:00:34,733 --> 01:00:36,568
<i>You want me to whack my doctor? </i>

1119
01:00:36,818 --> 01:00:39,612
<i>If you don 't do it, somebody else will. </i>

1120
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:42,073
<i>Nobody touches this guy. </i>

1121
01:00:42,323 --> 01:00:44,701
<i>Anybody lays a finger on him,
I'm gonna kill him. </i>

1122
01:00:45,076 --> 01:00:46,286
<i>Understood? </i>

1123
01:00:47,745 --> 01:00:49,289
Now let's hear the other one.

1124
01:00:50,373 --> 01:00:54,544
<i>-You want me to whack my doctor?
-lf you don 't, somebody else will. </i>

1125
01:00:55,336 --> 01:00:56,880
<i>I'm gonna kill him. </i>

1126
01:00:59,215 --> 01:01:01,009
- Good.
- Hat's very good.

1127
01:01:02,177 --> 01:01:03,845
<i>We think it's time to end it. </i>

1128
01:01:04,095 --> 01:01:05,096
<i>What do you mean? </i>

1129
01:01:05,346 --> 01:01:08,183
<i>Get rid of the shrink.
He knows too much already. </i>

1130
01:01:08,433 --> 01:01:12,645
<i>-You want me to whack my doctor?
-lf you don 't, somebody else will. </i>

1131
01:01:13,646 --> 01:01:15,148
<i>I'm gonna kill him. </i>

1132
01:01:19,652 --> 01:01:21,237
What do you want me to do?

1133
01:01:24,407 --> 01:01:26,618
<i>Paul, he's talking to the feds. </i>

1134
01:01:26,868 --> 01:01:29,537
I know this guy. He wouldn't
talk to the feds. No way.

1135
01:01:29,787 --> 01:01:33,625
he FBI was over at his house today.
Jimmy Boots saw them.

1136
01:01:34,042 --> 01:01:36,461
- You saw them there?
- It's the truth. I saw them.

1137
01:01:36,711 --> 01:01:38,171
Next, you'll get a call...

1138
01:01:38,504 --> 01:01:40,131
...and he'll want a meeting.

1139
01:01:42,717 --> 01:01:44,010
Dr. Sobel called.

1140
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:46,721
He said he needs to see you
right away.

1141
01:01:56,689 --> 01:01:58,191
his is delicious.

1142
01:01:58,441 --> 01:01:59,901
his is so good.

1143
01:02:00,276 --> 01:02:01,819
I love Italian food.

1144
01:02:02,070 --> 01:02:04,030
I've never been to Italy. Is it great?

1145
01:02:04,572 --> 01:02:06,115
I was in France twice...

1146
01:02:06,366 --> 01:02:08,159
...and Jamaica, the island.

1147
01:02:08,409 --> 01:02:09,327
You ever been there?

1148
01:02:09,577 --> 01:02:11,412
It's great,
because I love to snorkel.

1149
01:02:11,663 --> 01:02:14,666
You guys ever snorkeled?
It's great to sleep with the fish.

1150
01:02:14,916 --> 01:02:17,001
Swim with the fish.
Ever done that?

1151
01:02:17,252 --> 01:02:19,212
It's good. So...

1152
01:02:19,462 --> 01:02:21,047
...what are you doing this summer?

1153
01:02:21,881 --> 01:02:23,258
About what?

1154
01:02:25,593 --> 01:02:26,886
How are you?

1155
01:02:28,763 --> 01:02:30,640
- How you doing?
- Good.

1156
01:02:31,015 --> 01:02:33,434
his is Ben. Say hello to Carlo.

1157
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:35,687
- How you doing?
- Carlo...?

1158
01:02:35,937 --> 01:02:38,106
hat's it. Grab a seat.

1159
01:02:41,317 --> 01:02:43,194
Carlo and I grew up together.

1160
01:02:43,444 --> 01:02:45,363
He's like, I would say, almost...

1161
01:02:45,613 --> 01:02:47,448
...like a cousin to me.

1162
01:02:47,699 --> 01:02:50,034
- I am your cousin.
- Hat's what I'm saying.

1163
01:02:50,284 --> 01:02:52,328
It's a family thing.
It's the closeness.

1164
01:02:52,578 --> 01:02:55,540
Anything I can do for him,
I'm here for him.

1165
01:02:55,790 --> 01:02:57,083
- You know that.
- I know.

1166
01:02:57,333 --> 01:02:59,085
Did you take care of that thing?

1167
01:02:59,419 --> 01:03:02,880
- It's all right to talk business?
- It's okay.

1168
01:03:03,214 --> 01:03:04,716
- I took care of it.
- And the other?

1169
01:03:04,966 --> 01:03:08,094
I got to wait for the first
before I can move on the second.

1170
01:03:08,344 --> 01:03:09,887
he guy give you a problem?

1171
01:03:10,138 --> 01:03:12,974
he guy in the first thing?
He's a lunatic.

1172
01:03:13,224 --> 01:03:14,809
- What did he say?
- He usual.

1173
01:03:15,059 --> 01:03:17,854
<i>- You told him you weren't doing it?
-What am I going to do? </i>

1174
01:03:18,104 --> 01:03:19,939
<i>Gotta nip that shit in the bud. </i>

1175
01:03:20,189 --> 01:03:22,775
<i>But if the first comes through,
that'll fix everything. </i>

1176
01:03:23,025 --> 01:03:25,820
Including the second thing.
Exactly.

1177
01:03:26,988 --> 01:03:29,240
Don't repeat what you hear here.
You hear?

1178
01:03:29,782 --> 01:03:31,576
he first thing
or the second thing?

1179
01:03:31,826 --> 01:03:32,827
Very funny.

1180
01:03:33,077 --> 01:03:34,954
Stevie Beef is over there.

1181
01:03:36,497 --> 01:03:38,583
- Fat piece of shit.
- Rat fucking, cocksucking...

1182
01:03:38,833 --> 01:03:41,294
- Scumbag.
- Garbage pail.

1183
01:03:41,544 --> 01:03:42,754
Let's go say hi.

1184
01:03:48,050 --> 01:03:52,221
his is a very unusual place.
Do you guys come here often?

1185
01:03:52,472 --> 01:03:56,225
Well, this place has
a very special meaning for Paul.

1186
01:03:56,476 --> 01:03:58,895
Yeah, it's where his
father got whacked.

1187
01:04:00,563 --> 01:04:01,647
What's the big secret?

1188
01:04:01,898 --> 01:04:02,940
Never mind.

1189
01:04:03,191 --> 01:04:04,734
Wait a second.

1190
01:04:06,736 --> 01:04:08,196
Paul's father was murdered?

1191
01:04:08,446 --> 01:04:10,865
Right at that table,
with his whole family there.

1192
01:04:11,115 --> 01:04:13,117
Shut your face.

1193
01:04:16,496 --> 01:04:18,331
Paul was there too.

1194
01:04:19,415 --> 01:04:21,834
He doesn't like to talk about it.

1195
01:04:28,966 --> 01:04:30,134
Where you going?

1196
01:04:30,384 --> 01:04:31,511
o the bathroom.

1197
01:04:31,969 --> 01:04:33,221
Sit down.

1198
01:04:33,513 --> 01:04:35,014
I'm going with you.

1199
01:04:42,271 --> 01:04:44,732
Jelly, I have to, you know...

1200
01:04:45,066 --> 01:04:46,234
Poop?

1201
01:04:48,194 --> 01:04:49,362
Go ahead.

1202
01:05:11,259 --> 01:05:13,010
Holy shit!

1203
01:05:16,931 --> 01:05:19,141
You got to get more roughage, Doc.

1204
01:05:20,768 --> 01:05:22,979
A bran muffin in the morning
would help that.

1205
01:05:25,731 --> 01:05:26,899
I don't believe this.

1206
01:05:27,149 --> 01:05:29,443
I'd like to see a movie.
Nothing's playing.

1207
01:05:29,694 --> 01:05:32,863
It's all this shoot 'em-up
action bullshit.

1208
01:05:33,114 --> 01:05:35,074
I get enough of that at work.

1209
01:05:36,158 --> 01:05:38,786
Primo, that was our friend.

1210
01:05:39,078 --> 01:05:41,122
hey spotted that guy
at Paretti's.

1211
01:05:41,372 --> 01:05:42,873
hat's good.

1212
01:05:43,124 --> 01:05:44,625
hat's very good.

1213
01:05:44,875 --> 01:05:46,460
Handsome Jack.

1214
01:05:47,336 --> 01:05:49,213
Let's make it his last supper.

1215
01:05:49,547 --> 01:05:51,757
- You got it, Primo.
- No problem.

1216
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:54,802
Just for fun...

1217
01:05:55,302 --> 01:05:57,388
...tear out his heart
and bring it to me.

1218
01:05:57,638 --> 01:06:00,599
I'm gonna bring it back to you
on a fucking platter.

1219
01:06:00,850 --> 01:06:02,393
Where we going to get a platter?

1220
01:06:02,643 --> 01:06:04,103
Just bring it, all right?

1221
01:06:04,937 --> 01:06:07,106
Or Raisin Bran. Hat goes
right through me.

1222
01:06:07,356 --> 01:06:09,191
- It's a pusher.
- Good tip.

1223
01:06:09,442 --> 01:06:12,319
I have to talk to you.
In private.

1224
01:06:17,616 --> 01:06:19,452
Why didn't you tell me
about your father?

1225
01:06:19,702 --> 01:06:22,663
- What about him?
- You said he died of a heart attack.

1226
01:06:22,913 --> 01:06:23,998
What's the problem?

1227
01:06:24,248 --> 01:06:26,083
Your father was murdered.

1228
01:06:26,667 --> 01:06:28,878
What's the difference? He's dead.

1229
01:06:29,128 --> 01:06:32,048
It's a big difference.
Why didn't you tell me?

1230
01:06:32,298 --> 01:06:34,884
It's private. I got to tell you
every little thing?

1231
01:06:35,134 --> 01:06:36,594
his is not a little thing.

1232
01:06:36,844 --> 01:06:39,013
What should I do?
Spend my life crying over the past?

1233
01:06:39,263 --> 01:06:40,514
It's over. Forget it.

1234
01:06:40,765 --> 01:06:42,767
I think you want to talk about it.

1235
01:06:43,017 --> 01:06:44,852
- I don't want to talk about it.
- You do.

1236
01:06:45,102 --> 01:06:46,729
I don't want to talk about it.

1237
01:06:46,979 --> 01:06:49,315
- Why did you choose this restaurant?
- I like it.

1238
01:06:49,565 --> 01:06:51,567
Of all the places to go,
why here?

1239
01:06:51,817 --> 01:06:52,777
White clam sauce. He best.

1240
01:06:53,027 --> 01:06:56,572
hat's not the reason. You want me
to know about your father.

1241
01:06:56,822 --> 01:06:59,784
- You're reaching out to me.
- Yeah, I'm reaching out to you.

1242
01:07:00,409 --> 01:07:01,243
Where is it?

1243
01:07:11,295 --> 01:07:12,129
Get in the car.

1244
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:18,052
It's late. I'll take a cab.
I can get to Grand Central and...

1245
01:07:18,302 --> 01:07:20,137
You know what?
I can make the 11: 10.

1246
01:07:20,387 --> 01:07:21,722
So thanks anyway.

1247
01:07:21,972 --> 01:07:24,183
I said get in the car, Doc.

1248
01:07:25,392 --> 01:07:26,936
Do what he says.

1249
01:07:28,145 --> 01:07:32,233
<i>You know, this is called a "transference
neurosis, " where the patient...</i>

1250
01:07:35,778 --> 01:07:37,238
Get in the car.

1251
01:08:02,429 --> 01:08:06,058
What is this guy doing? He's been
in the bathroom for half an hour.

1252
01:08:06,684 --> 01:08:07,685
Fuck!

1253
01:08:07,935 --> 01:08:08,936
Get over there!

1254
01:08:17,278 --> 01:08:19,154
Son of a bitch!

1255
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,408
We lost him.

1256
01:08:51,353 --> 01:08:52,730
Come on, get out.

1257
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:54,565
Get out. Get over there.

1258
01:08:58,986 --> 01:09:00,529
All right, leave us alone.

1259
01:09:02,281 --> 01:09:03,574
Sorry, Doc.

1260
01:09:03,866 --> 01:09:04,992
It's not personal.

1261
01:09:05,242 --> 01:09:08,370
Don't kid yourself. It doesn't
get more personal than this.

1262
01:09:10,622 --> 01:09:12,166
Walk over there.

1263
01:09:12,458 --> 01:09:13,959
Walk over there.

1264
01:09:19,798 --> 01:09:22,051
- You know why I gotta do this?
- Yes. Do you?

1265
01:09:22,301 --> 01:09:25,137
Don't bullshit me.
You ratted me out. You betrayed me.

1266
01:09:25,387 --> 01:09:28,265
I betrayed you? Hat's interesting.
Who's got the gun?

1267
01:09:28,515 --> 01:09:31,101
Don't give me that.
Are you insulting my intelligence?

1268
01:09:31,351 --> 01:09:32,895
You cooperated with the feds.

1269
01:09:33,145 --> 01:09:36,315
hey played me a tape. I heard you
say you were gonna kill me.

1270
01:09:36,565 --> 01:09:38,942
- I heard the tape.
- Never. On my mother's life.

1271
01:09:39,193 --> 01:09:40,235
- Never.
- I heard it.

1272
01:09:40,486 --> 01:09:42,905
It's not important now,
but I did not betray you.

1273
01:09:43,155 --> 01:09:45,824
I had a wire, but took it off
because I think I can help.

1274
01:09:46,075 --> 01:09:48,035
I don't want to know what you think.

1275
01:09:48,285 --> 01:09:49,119
Yes, you do.

1276
01:09:49,369 --> 01:09:50,788
Let me help you!

1277
01:09:51,038 --> 01:09:52,247
It's over!

1278
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:58,295
Can I ask you one last question?

1279
01:10:00,214 --> 01:10:01,089
What?

1280
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:02,633
- What did you order?
- What?

1281
01:10:02,883 --> 01:10:04,468
- What did you order?
- When?

1282
01:10:04,718 --> 01:10:07,513
he night your father was killed,
what were you eating?

1283
01:10:07,763 --> 01:10:09,640
How the fuck do I know?

1284
01:10:10,057 --> 01:10:11,099
You don't remember?

1285
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:12,684
It was 35 years ago.

1286
01:10:12,935 --> 01:10:14,144
What was your father eating?

1287
01:10:14,394 --> 01:10:16,730
I don't remember.
What are you talking about?

1288
01:10:17,022 --> 01:10:17,981
ry.

1289
01:10:18,565 --> 01:10:22,236
It's a simple question.
What was your father eating?

1290
01:10:32,371 --> 01:10:33,247
Penne.

1291
01:10:34,873 --> 01:10:35,707
Good.

1292
01:10:35,958 --> 01:10:37,334
What did you have?

1293
01:10:41,839 --> 01:10:43,090
Ravioli.

1294
01:10:44,508 --> 01:10:46,510
he food was already on the table?

1295
01:10:47,261 --> 01:10:48,929
No, they were serving it.

1296
01:10:50,222 --> 01:10:52,057
And did you see the guys coming?

1297
01:10:54,309 --> 01:10:55,519
One of them.

1298
01:10:57,229 --> 01:10:58,981
Dressed like a busboy.

1299
01:11:00,315 --> 01:11:02,067
Your father saw him too?

1300
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:05,862
I knew the guy looked wrong.

1301
01:11:06,113 --> 01:11:07,197
Why, Paul?

1302
01:11:07,656 --> 01:11:10,784
he pants. Looked too good
for a busboy.

1303
01:11:12,035 --> 01:11:13,954
So he walked to the table.

1304
01:11:14,204 --> 01:11:16,081
I watched him the whole way.

1305
01:11:16,373 --> 01:11:17,958
Did you say anything?

1306
01:11:23,338 --> 01:11:26,508
Dad was so mad at me,
I couldn't say anything.

1307
01:11:26,758 --> 01:11:28,260
And you were mad at him.

1308
01:11:30,345 --> 01:11:31,763
And then what happened?

1309
01:11:32,014 --> 01:11:35,267
I never saw the second guy.
My mother just started screaming.

1310
01:11:35,976 --> 01:11:37,811
And you blame yourself.

1311
01:11:38,145 --> 01:11:40,522
I could've saved him.

1312
01:11:40,772 --> 01:11:42,232
But you were mad at him.

1313
01:11:42,482 --> 01:11:44,234
I should've said something.

1314
01:11:44,484 --> 01:11:46,445
You couldn't have saved him, Paul.

1315
01:11:46,737 --> 01:11:48,322
I killed him.

1316
01:11:49,364 --> 01:11:50,907
You didn't kill him.

1317
01:11:51,158 --> 01:11:53,994
You were mad, but you didn't
kill him. It's the life he chose.

1318
01:11:54,244 --> 01:11:56,538
I just let him die.

1319
01:11:57,873 --> 01:12:00,375
I let him die!

1320
01:12:03,211 --> 01:12:07,966
I let him die, and I couldn't
say goodbye to him.

1321
01:12:10,427 --> 01:12:12,262
So why don't you say it now?

1322
01:12:12,512 --> 01:12:14,639
If he was here,
what would you say?

1323
01:12:14,890 --> 01:12:16,141
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1324
01:12:16,391 --> 01:12:17,476
I can't.

1325
01:12:17,726 --> 01:12:18,810
No, I can't.

1326
01:12:19,061 --> 01:12:20,020
ell him, Paul.

1327
01:12:21,271 --> 01:12:23,023
I want to say I'm...

1328
01:12:23,273 --> 01:12:24,858
Dad, I'm sorry.

1329
01:12:27,986 --> 01:12:29,321
I'm sorry.

1330
01:12:30,781 --> 01:12:32,407
I'm sorry, Dad.

1331
01:12:33,909 --> 01:12:36,369
I'm sorry. I let him die.

1332
01:12:37,829 --> 01:12:40,248
I'm sorry, Dad.

1333
01:12:42,918 --> 01:12:44,002
Jesus.

1334
01:12:45,087 --> 01:12:47,089
Poor guy's falling apart.

1335
01:12:47,339 --> 01:12:48,799
Why don't he just pop him?

1336
01:12:49,049 --> 01:12:51,927
It's embarrassing,
standing here like this.

1337
01:12:52,552 --> 01:12:53,428
Shut up.

1338
01:13:01,728 --> 01:13:02,813
You couldn't save him.

1339
01:13:03,063 --> 01:13:04,606
I know I could've. I could've.

1340
01:13:04,856 --> 01:13:06,858
No, he was trying to save you.

1341
01:13:07,109 --> 01:13:08,860
hat's what you fought about.

1342
01:13:09,111 --> 01:13:12,697
He didn't want this for you.
And you don't want it for Anthony.

1343
01:13:12,948 --> 01:13:13,907
No, I don't!

1344
01:13:14,157 --> 01:13:17,452
You don't want him to grow up
like you did, without a father.

1345
01:13:23,792 --> 01:13:25,710
Your father's not dead, Paul.

1346
01:13:25,961 --> 01:13:29,506
He's alive in you.
And he's trying to tell you something.

1347
01:13:29,756 --> 01:13:31,007
He's trying to tell you...

1348
01:13:31,258 --> 01:13:32,759
Holy shit!

1349
01:13:34,636 --> 01:13:37,264
hey're shooting! Hey're shooting!

1350
01:13:42,811 --> 01:13:45,397
- Pull yourself together!
- I feel so bad!

1351
01:13:45,689 --> 01:13:48,108
You're going to feel a lot worse.

1352
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,865
ime to channel all this
nice grief...

1353
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:56,575
...into a murderous rage.

1354
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:00,203
Come on!
ime to shoot back!

1355
01:14:00,453 --> 01:14:02,664
Let's go! Here we go!
Bang, bang!

1356
01:14:04,124 --> 01:14:06,293
Bang, bang! Come on. Let's go.

1357
01:14:06,543 --> 01:14:08,753
Come on! Bang, bang!

1358
01:14:09,254 --> 01:14:10,714
Now come on. Paul, here.

1359
01:14:10,964 --> 01:14:13,425
Put the gun in your hand and shoot!

1360
01:14:13,675 --> 01:14:16,177
For God sakes, shoot somebody!

1361
01:14:18,471 --> 01:14:20,307
Give me the fucking gun!

1362
01:14:38,658 --> 01:14:40,035
Stay down.

1363
01:14:41,661 --> 01:14:43,079
Paul, you okay?

1364
01:14:43,330 --> 01:14:44,706
Yeah, I'm okay.

1365
01:14:46,041 --> 01:14:47,500
Jelly, did I do that?

1366
01:14:48,084 --> 01:14:49,336
No, Doc.

1367
01:14:49,586 --> 01:14:50,629
hat one's mine.

1368
01:14:50,879 --> 01:14:52,589
You get the '72 Chevy...

1369
01:14:52,839 --> 01:14:56,217
...and the Amana side-by-side
refrigerator-freezer.

1370
01:14:56,843 --> 01:14:59,387
- You okay, Paul?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1371
01:14:59,638 --> 01:15:01,556
I'm gonna check on Jimmy.

1372
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:11,107
Pretty fucking ironic, ain't it?

1373
01:15:12,359 --> 01:15:14,361
You can give me back the gun now.

1374
01:15:15,362 --> 01:15:18,156
It's okay. I wasn't really
gonna whack you.

1375
01:15:19,532 --> 01:15:21,701
All right, maybe I was
gonna whack you...

1376
01:15:21,951 --> 01:15:24,662
...but I was real conflicted about it.

1377
01:15:24,913 --> 01:15:26,289
Progress, right?

1378
01:15:32,253 --> 01:15:34,047
I can't see you anymore.

1379
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:36,383
I know.

1380
01:15:38,843 --> 01:15:40,637
You hit some
very big stuff tonight.

1381
01:15:40,887 --> 01:15:43,306
So you'll probably
feel like this for a while.

1382
01:15:44,015 --> 01:15:45,850
But you're close to something.

1383
01:15:46,768 --> 01:15:48,144
he rest is up to you.

1384
01:15:49,396 --> 01:15:50,397
Good luck.

1385
01:15:58,905 --> 01:16:01,324
I want to please him
when we're in bed...

1386
01:16:01,574 --> 01:16:05,078
...but whatever I do, it seems
like it's never enough.

1387
01:16:05,411 --> 01:16:08,665
Now he wants me to
say things when we're making love.

1388
01:16:12,627 --> 01:16:15,088
What kind of things does he
want you to say?

1389
01:16:15,463 --> 01:16:17,882
Well, he wants me to call him...

1390
01:16:18,133 --> 01:16:19,467
<i>..."big boy"...</i>

1391
01:16:21,219 --> 01:16:23,763
<i>...and he's my "bucking bronco"...</i>

1392
01:16:24,556 --> 01:16:26,683
<i>...and I'm supposed
to "ride him hard"...</i>

1393
01:16:26,933 --> 01:16:29,769
<i>...and "put him back
in the barn wet. "</i>

1394
01:16:40,822 --> 01:16:42,240
Are you okay, Dr. Sobel?

1395
01:16:43,741 --> 01:16:45,118
Well, it's...

1396
01:16:47,912 --> 01:16:50,164
Here's what I think
you should do, Elaine.

1397
01:16:51,249 --> 01:16:53,668
I would do whatever he says.

1398
01:16:54,335 --> 01:16:56,546
If he wants you to talk, talk.

1399
01:16:56,796 --> 01:16:58,548
I'd get down
and bark like a dog.

1400
01:16:58,798 --> 01:17:00,091
I'd do whatever it takes.

1401
01:17:00,341 --> 01:17:02,635
Smoke some joints,
drink wine, whatever it is...

1402
01:17:02,886 --> 01:17:04,971
...to get off on each other
and be happy.

1403
01:17:05,221 --> 01:17:06,431
Where are you running?

1404
01:17:06,681 --> 01:17:08,474
his is a time to be happy!

1405
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:11,185
Because life is just too short.

1406
01:17:11,436 --> 01:17:14,772
It's just too fucking short.

1407
01:17:23,615 --> 01:17:25,158
I'll see you hursday.

1408
01:17:30,330 --> 01:17:31,581
Everything okay?

1409
01:17:34,751 --> 01:17:36,127
Feeling all right?

1410
01:17:36,377 --> 01:17:37,795
You need anything?

1411
01:17:38,046 --> 01:17:38,963
No. Feel great.

1412
01:17:39,213 --> 01:17:41,007
Never felt better.

1413
01:17:41,549 --> 01:17:45,345
Wait'll I go to that meeting.
I'm gonna knock them dead.

1414
01:17:45,887 --> 01:17:48,681
All right. I'll be outside.

1415
01:17:55,146 --> 01:17:56,314
<i>When I look at him... </i>

1416
01:17:56,564 --> 01:17:58,900
<i>... I think about how
different it was. </i>

1417
01:17:59,317 --> 01:18:02,111
<i>Was providing for a family
simpler back then... </i>

1418
01:18:02,362 --> 01:18:04,822
<i>... or did he just make it
look that way? </i>

1419
01:18:08,326 --> 01:18:10,370
<i>Decisions are tougher now. </i>

1420
01:18:10,662 --> 01:18:12,080
<i>There's so much information... </i>

1421
01:18:12,330 --> 01:18:14,749
<i>... so many ways to invest. </i>

1422
01:18:21,673 --> 01:18:24,133
<i>Strange. I spent the first half
of my life... </i>

1423
01:18:24,384 --> 01:18:26,594
<i>... not wanting to walk
in his footsteps. </i>

1424
01:18:26,886 --> 01:18:29,013
<i>Now I only wish I could. </i>

1425
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:34,268
<i>Times are more complex. </i>

1426
01:18:34,519 --> 01:18:37,480
<i>A Merrill Lynch financial
consultant can help with a plan... </i>

1427
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:41,401
<i>... and more ways to make
the plan work than anyone else. </i>

1428
01:18:52,495 --> 01:18:54,247
You look beautiful, honey.

1429
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:09,011
We are put on this earth
to find a love, a soul mate...

1430
01:19:09,262 --> 01:19:12,140
...someone with whom
we can create joy.

1431
01:19:12,390 --> 01:19:13,516
And how glad we are...

1432
01:19:13,766 --> 01:19:15,476
...that Ben and Laura
found each other.

1433
01:19:15,726 --> 01:19:17,520
And we anticipate and celebrate...

1434
01:19:17,770 --> 01:19:21,065
...the years of joy they will
share together from this day on.

1435
01:19:23,985 --> 01:19:26,237
Do you take Laura to be
your wedded wife...

1436
01:19:26,487 --> 01:19:28,447
...for richer or poorer,
in sickness or health...

1437
01:19:28,698 --> 01:19:30,700
...till death do you part,
so help you God?

1438
01:19:31,951 --> 01:19:33,286
Excuse me?

1439
01:19:33,744 --> 01:19:35,913
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to him.

1440
01:19:36,164 --> 01:19:37,331
Who him?

1441
01:19:37,582 --> 01:19:38,833
It's not important. Yes.

1442
01:19:39,292 --> 01:19:40,293
Yes, what?

1443
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:42,378
Yes to the first part. O her.

1444
01:19:42,628 --> 01:19:44,630
hat's a yes. Pick it up from there.

1445
01:19:45,298 --> 01:19:47,216
Doc, this is an emergency.

1446
01:19:47,466 --> 01:19:49,427
- I don't believe this.
- His is my wedding!

1447
01:19:49,677 --> 01:19:52,430
- Want me to make a scene?
- Bigger than this?

1448
01:19:53,806 --> 01:19:55,266
ick-tock. Let's go.

1449
01:19:55,516 --> 01:19:56,350
Hurry. Pronounce.

1450
01:19:56,642 --> 01:19:59,645
By the power vested in me,
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1451
01:20:00,646 --> 01:20:01,981
Ring, ring. Kiss, kiss.

1452
01:20:03,691 --> 01:20:06,027
Here. Fine. Good.
Okay, just go.

1453
01:20:06,277 --> 01:20:08,487
Sorry, Mrs. Sobel. Duty calls.

1454
01:20:08,738 --> 01:20:11,324
You're the first person to
call me Mrs. Sobel.

1455
01:20:11,824 --> 01:20:12,658
Nice, huh?

1456
01:20:23,419 --> 01:20:25,546
I'm telling you, Doc,
this is serious.

1457
01:20:25,796 --> 01:20:27,965
If he don't make that meeting,
they'll kill him.

1458
01:20:28,215 --> 01:20:30,259
Can't somebody else
in the family go for him?

1459
01:20:30,509 --> 01:20:33,596
What about ommy the ongue
or Louie the Lip?

1460
01:20:33,846 --> 01:20:35,514
What about you? Why don't you go?

1461
01:20:35,806 --> 01:20:38,976
hat would be a very good idea,
except for one little detail.

1462
01:20:39,226 --> 01:20:42,104
I'm a fucking moron.
I'm known for it.

1463
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,523
- You gotta go.
- You must be a moron.

1464
01:20:44,774 --> 01:20:46,067
- Watch it!
- You just said it.

1465
01:20:46,317 --> 01:20:49,654
When I say it, it's different.
When you say it, it sounds negative.

1466
01:20:49,904 --> 01:20:51,948
Jelly, I am not going
to any meeting.

1467
01:20:52,198 --> 01:20:54,909
I am no longer on the payroll.
Do you understand that?

1468
01:20:55,159 --> 01:20:57,703
Now, I am going back to my wife.

1469
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:04,335
Now, Jelly, we've
been through this before.

1470
01:21:04,585 --> 01:21:05,836
You can't shoot me.

1471
01:21:06,087 --> 01:21:07,254
Correction:

1472
01:21:08,047 --> 01:21:10,591
It was Mr. Vitti who
couldn't shoot you.

1473
01:21:12,218 --> 01:21:14,387
You're going to that meeting.

1474
01:21:18,724 --> 01:21:22,186
his is Surveillance 6. hey've left
the building and are heading east.

1475
01:21:22,436 --> 01:21:23,688
<i>Roger that. </i>

1476
01:21:27,233 --> 01:21:28,609
- Put this on.
- Is this chrome?

1477
01:21:28,859 --> 01:21:30,194
I can see my own reflection.

1478
01:21:30,444 --> 01:21:31,821
Let me tell you something.

1479
01:21:32,071 --> 01:21:33,823
hat's a $ 1,200 Valentino suit.

1480
01:21:34,073 --> 01:21:35,658
If you spill anything on it...

1481
01:21:35,908 --> 01:21:37,702
...I'm gonna mess you up good.

1482
01:21:37,952 --> 01:21:40,162
Shut up! You're
making him nervous.

1483
01:21:40,413 --> 01:21:42,915
If he fucks up,
they'll kill him for sure.

1484
01:21:43,165 --> 01:21:44,333
his is insane!

1485
01:21:44,583 --> 01:21:48,504
It's all right. Let's go over it
again. Mr. Vitti's been detained.

1486
01:21:48,754 --> 01:21:50,798
Apologies all around.

1487
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:54,260
<i>And then you say
you're the new consigliere... </i>

1488
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:55,970
...speaking for Mr. Vitti.

1489
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:57,179
hen what?

1490
01:21:57,430 --> 01:22:01,016
hen you keep your mouth shut
and hope nobody asks you nothing.

1491
01:22:01,267 --> 01:22:03,018
hat's some plan you got there.

1492
01:22:03,269 --> 01:22:06,814
Shut up!
Doc, if you gotta talk...

1493
01:22:07,148 --> 01:22:09,191
...try to be vague.
Could you do that?

1494
01:22:09,442 --> 01:22:12,445
I'm a psychiatrist.
Believe me, I can be vague.

1495
01:22:15,406 --> 01:22:17,450
<i>Looks like they're
headed for the tunnel. </i>

1496
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:22,288
<i>We'll pick them up
on the other side. </i>

1497
01:22:27,585 --> 01:22:29,128
<i>Here they come. </i>

1498
01:22:32,631 --> 01:22:33,507
Which one is it?

1499
01:22:33,757 --> 01:22:35,426
<i>The black one. </i>

1500
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:50,274
Are you sure you don't want
something to eat?

1501
01:22:52,109 --> 01:22:53,986
You want some iced tea?

1502
01:22:55,487 --> 01:22:57,698
I think I'm gonna call
Dr. Erragrossa.

1503
01:22:57,948 --> 01:22:59,867
Is Daddy gonna be all right?

1504
01:23:01,368 --> 01:23:03,204
I think so, honey.

1505
01:23:03,537 --> 01:23:05,456
Shouldn't you be outside playing?

1506
01:23:06,165 --> 01:23:07,791
No, it's all right.

1507
01:23:09,668 --> 01:23:11,295
How long you gonna sit there?

1508
01:23:11,837 --> 01:23:13,547
How long you gonna lay there?

1509
01:23:17,718 --> 01:23:18,886
I'm done.

1510
01:23:56,966 --> 01:23:58,050
Let's go.

1511
01:24:00,302 --> 01:24:01,762
It'll be all right, Doc.

1512
01:24:17,403 --> 01:24:19,863
here's no way I can
get away with this.

1513
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:21,740
Jelly, I can't do this!

1514
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:23,701
Don't fucking whine.

1515
01:24:23,951 --> 01:24:26,161
Whining's a dead giveaway.

1516
01:24:26,412 --> 01:24:27,496
Blend.

1517
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:29,206
Blend in.

1518
01:24:36,422 --> 01:24:37,923
So where's Vitti?

1519
01:24:38,465 --> 01:24:39,675
He ain't here.

1520
01:24:39,925 --> 01:24:41,218
He ain't here.

1521
01:24:41,468 --> 01:24:42,386
How you doing?

1522
01:24:42,636 --> 01:24:45,097
How you doing?
How you been? All right?

1523
01:24:45,764 --> 01:24:46,849
All right.

1524
01:24:47,683 --> 01:24:49,643
Hey, when did you guys get out?

1525
01:24:49,893 --> 01:24:51,812
You need anything, you let me know.

1526
01:25:00,028 --> 01:25:01,488
Easter weekend.

1527
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:04,616
You're a planet!

1528
01:25:08,495 --> 01:25:09,747
Blending, enough.

1529
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:14,585
Who's the guy with Jelly?

1530
01:25:14,877 --> 01:25:16,503
I never seen him before.

1531
01:25:23,635 --> 01:25:25,512
What's going on? Where's Paul?

1532
01:25:26,013 --> 01:25:27,306
He'll be here. Don't worry.

1533
01:25:27,556 --> 01:25:29,349
And what's he doing here?

1534
01:25:30,350 --> 01:25:31,435
He's just...

1535
01:25:32,561 --> 01:25:33,979
Forget about it.

1536
01:25:34,396 --> 01:25:35,647
Forget about it?

1537
01:25:35,939 --> 01:25:38,108
<i>What the hell is that?
"Forget about it. "</i>

1538
01:25:38,692 --> 01:25:41,904
I can't do this.
No, I can't do this.

1539
01:25:42,738 --> 01:25:44,823
I think we're going
to get started here.

1540
01:25:45,073 --> 01:25:47,409
We got a lot to talk about
here today, and...

1541
01:25:47,659 --> 01:25:50,662
...for now, we'll just stick
with the more important issues.

1542
01:25:50,913 --> 01:25:51,914
And one more thing...

1543
01:25:52,164 --> 01:25:54,082
...if you got anything to say...

1544
01:25:54,333 --> 01:25:57,377
...let us know who you are, because
a lot of us don't know each other.

1545
01:25:57,628 --> 01:26:02,132
I didn't think anybody here was
into wearing fucking nametags.

1546
01:26:10,933 --> 01:26:12,643
I'm Primo Sindone.

1547
01:26:12,893 --> 01:26:14,811
hey call me Sonny Long.

1548
01:26:15,062 --> 01:26:17,439
Some of you know me
as Mikey Gaga.

1549
01:26:17,689 --> 01:26:19,566
Some of you know me
as Joey Boombots.

1550
01:26:19,816 --> 01:26:23,487
Be that as it may, it's good to see so
many of the old faces here...

1551
01:26:23,737 --> 01:26:26,615
...and to welcome some of the new ones
from all over the country.

1552
01:26:27,866 --> 01:26:30,535
I see Joe Baldassare,
Frankie Zello.

1553
01:26:32,079 --> 01:26:35,999
But I'm disappointed the head of our
other New York family isn't here.

1554
01:26:36,708 --> 01:26:40,337
All I see is his man Jelly and some
sawed-off prick nobody knows.

1555
01:26:48,512 --> 01:26:50,264
he thing is...

1556
01:26:50,514 --> 01:26:53,642
...Mr. Vitti's been detained.

1557
01:26:55,227 --> 01:26:58,105
Plus, he's sorry for his detainment.

1558
01:26:58,355 --> 01:26:59,439
Detained?

1559
01:26:59,898 --> 01:27:01,233
What kind of shit is that?

1560
01:27:01,775 --> 01:27:03,819
What's more important than this?

1561
01:27:04,069 --> 01:27:07,781
As the host, I take his not being
here as a sign of disrespect to me...

1562
01:27:08,031 --> 01:27:11,118
...and all these other men
who came a long way to be here.

1563
01:27:12,411 --> 01:27:14,204
I mean, no. I mean...

1564
01:27:14,454 --> 01:27:16,999
You see, the thing is that
he's not feeling well.

1565
01:27:17,249 --> 01:27:19,084
Plus, he don't feel good.

1566
01:27:21,586 --> 01:27:23,130
What's the matter with you?

1567
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:25,632
Never discuss Mr. Vitti's
health outside the family.

1568
01:27:25,882 --> 01:27:27,634
You know better than that.

1569
01:27:28,093 --> 01:27:29,136
Sit down.

1570
01:27:30,095 --> 01:27:31,638
Sit down!

1571
01:27:32,139 --> 01:27:33,807
You want a fresh one?

1572
01:27:37,227 --> 01:27:38,061
Who is this guy?

1573
01:27:38,311 --> 01:27:39,980
What the fuck is he doing here?

1574
01:27:40,230 --> 01:27:41,189
Who I am?

1575
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:43,275
Who I am? Who am I?

1576
01:27:43,525 --> 01:27:45,277
<i>"Who am I? " is a question
for the ages.</i>

1577
01:27:45,527 --> 01:27:48,280
hat's one we're all searching for,
to find out who I am.

1578
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:50,657
Who's in there, who wants
to come out and go...

1579
01:27:50,907 --> 01:27:52,200
<i>..."Hey, I'm hungry. "</i>

1580
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:54,119
Who I am...

1581
01:27:54,411 --> 01:27:56,538
...is too deep and...

1582
01:27:56,788 --> 01:27:58,749
You got to go in
and pull out the thing...

1583
01:27:58,999 --> 01:28:01,835
...like that movie where the thing
came out of the stomach...

1584
01:28:02,085 --> 01:28:04,296
...and ate the people on
the fucking spaceship.

1585
01:28:04,546 --> 01:28:06,047
May they rest in peace.

1586
01:28:06,298 --> 01:28:08,175
My name is Ben Sobel.

1587
01:28:09,593 --> 01:28:10,677
Leone.

1588
01:28:10,927 --> 01:28:12,262
Ben Sobeleone.

1589
01:28:12,596 --> 01:28:14,264
I'm also known...

1590
01:28:14,514 --> 01:28:18,268
...as Benny the Groin,
Sammy the Schnoz...

1591
01:28:18,518 --> 01:28:20,937
...EImer the Fudd,
ubby the uba...

1592
01:28:21,188 --> 01:28:23,607
...and once as
Miss Phyllis Levine.

1593
01:28:23,857 --> 01:28:25,901
But that was at a party, years ago.

1594
01:28:26,151 --> 01:28:28,445
I smoked a titibet,
and I had a Quaalude...

1595
01:28:28,695 --> 01:28:31,406
...and suddenly I'm in fishnets
singing show tunes.

1596
01:28:31,656 --> 01:28:33,950
hese things happen,
but it has nothing to do...

1597
01:28:34,201 --> 01:28:36,870
...with what I'm doing here
with you fine gentlemen today.

1598
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,205
So I apologize.

1599
01:28:38,455 --> 01:28:42,375
hat being said, I'm also known to
the people who know me the best...

1600
01:28:42,626 --> 01:28:44,628
<i>...as the fucking "Doctor. "</i>

1601
01:28:45,212 --> 01:28:49,299
<i>he second part of your question
that you "axed" me...</i>

1602
01:28:49,549 --> 01:28:52,802
<i>...is "Why am I here? "
I am here...</i>

1603
01:28:53,386 --> 01:28:56,723
...representing Mr. Paul Vitti
as his consigligliere.

1604
01:28:58,517 --> 01:28:59,392
<i>Consigliere. </i>

1605
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:06,024
Never correct me in public again.

1606
01:29:06,274 --> 01:29:08,109
Do you understand that?

1607
01:29:09,611 --> 01:29:11,404
You broke my heart, Jelly.

1608
01:29:11,655 --> 01:29:13,657
You broke my heart.

1609
01:29:16,326 --> 01:29:19,538
I apologize for
the second interruption.

1610
01:29:21,039 --> 01:29:22,999
As Mr. Vitti's...

1611
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:24,918
...consigliere...

1612
01:29:26,628 --> 01:29:30,048
...I am involved in all aspects
of the Vitti family business...

1613
01:29:30,298 --> 01:29:32,801
...and am prepared to speak
for Mr. Vitti on all matters.

1614
01:29:33,093 --> 01:29:35,095
Badda-bing-badda-boom-Betty Boop.

1615
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:37,389
Okay, Doctor.

1616
01:29:37,639 --> 01:29:39,516
Let's stop with the bullshit.

1617
01:29:42,352 --> 01:29:44,187
here's been this thing
between me...

1618
01:29:44,437 --> 01:29:46,064
...and Paul Vitti for a long time.

1619
01:29:47,524 --> 01:29:50,902
Are you talking about the first thing
or the second thing?

1620
01:29:51,236 --> 01:29:53,321
What second thing?
I only know one thing.

1621
01:29:54,281 --> 01:29:57,784
How can we bring up the first
if we don't talk about the second?

1622
01:29:58,034 --> 01:29:59,411
Did you talk to the guy?

1623
01:29:59,661 --> 01:30:00,537
What guy?

1624
01:30:01,621 --> 01:30:03,331
he guy with the thing!

1625
01:30:03,581 --> 01:30:05,417
What thing?
What are you talking about?

1626
01:30:05,667 --> 01:30:07,627
How should I know?
You brought it up!

1627
01:30:07,877 --> 01:30:09,754
his is the problem.
Do you see this?

1628
01:30:10,005 --> 01:30:11,673
You see what's happening here?

1629
01:30:11,923 --> 01:30:15,552
You can't have an intelligent
conversation with this guy.

1630
01:30:17,721 --> 01:30:21,057
What if I put two bullets in your brain?
What do you think of that?

1631
01:30:21,307 --> 01:30:23,810
hat's a little dark.
What do you think?

1632
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:27,856
It's a good idea. Why would I say
it if I didn't think it was good?

1633
01:30:28,106 --> 01:30:29,274
I don't know, why?

1634
01:30:29,816 --> 01:30:31,776
I wouldn't!
hat's what I'm saying!

1635
01:30:33,653 --> 01:30:36,906
Look at what's happening here.
Look at you.

1636
01:30:37,449 --> 01:30:41,036
Do you feel you have to get angry
so people will listen to you?

1637
01:30:41,286 --> 01:30:42,412
Is that your deal?

1638
01:30:42,662 --> 01:30:43,788
What is he saying?

1639
01:30:44,039 --> 01:30:46,541
You do have a tendency
to get angry a lot.

1640
01:30:46,791 --> 01:30:48,293
I agree, Primo.

1641
01:30:48,543 --> 01:30:51,046
I'm talking about Vitti.
Why are we talking about me?

1642
01:30:51,921 --> 01:30:53,298
hat's interesting too.

1643
01:30:53,631 --> 01:30:58,136
Do you feel you're not important
enough for us to discuss you?

1644
01:30:58,386 --> 01:31:00,055
- What does that mean?
- What do you think?

1645
01:31:00,305 --> 01:31:01,598
Fuck you!

1646
01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:03,349
Calm down.

1647
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:05,727
his prick won't stop
with the questions.

1648
01:31:05,977 --> 01:31:06,936
Pass the fruit.

1649
01:31:07,187 --> 01:31:08,188
You're a dead man!

1650
01:31:13,651 --> 01:31:14,736
Put it down.

1651
01:31:16,362 --> 01:31:17,363
Put it down.

1652
01:31:23,495 --> 01:31:26,414
- Wait in the car. Keep it running.
- How are you feeling?

1653
01:31:26,664 --> 01:31:28,583
Sit down.
I'll take it from here.

1654
01:31:28,833 --> 01:31:29,667
Sit down.

1655
01:31:33,046 --> 01:31:34,506
I'm Paul Vitti.

1656
01:31:35,006 --> 01:31:38,676
I'm sorry I was late. Hose who know me
know I meant no disrespect.

1657
01:31:39,594 --> 01:31:41,387
If it's all right with you...

1658
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:44,974
...I want to say something.
hen I'll leave you to your business.

1659
01:31:45,225 --> 01:31:49,062
About 21/2 weeks ago, somebody killed
my dear friend, Dominic Manetta.

1660
01:31:51,105 --> 01:31:52,565
Come on, this is bullshit.

1661
01:31:52,816 --> 01:31:55,860
Everybody knows he whacked Dominic
so he could take over.

1662
01:31:56,277 --> 01:31:57,320
Whatever.

1663
01:31:57,570 --> 01:32:02,450
What I came to say is I've come to
a very important decision in my life.

1664
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:04,118
And that is...

1665
01:32:05,036 --> 01:32:06,412
...I want out.

1666
01:32:06,913 --> 01:32:08,748
I don't want to do this no more.

1667
01:32:10,291 --> 01:32:12,210
I'm going to
go away for a while...

1668
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:15,547
...but I will respect the oath
I took the day I was made...

1669
01:32:15,797 --> 01:32:19,217
...and what I know about anybody's
business I take to the grave.

1670
01:32:19,467 --> 01:32:21,094
You have my word.

1671
01:32:22,220 --> 01:32:24,264
As for my own family...

1672
01:32:24,889 --> 01:32:27,850
...I know Carlo Mangano would
like to be the new boss.

1673
01:32:28,101 --> 01:32:29,269
hank you, Paul.

1674
01:32:29,519 --> 01:32:31,729
hat's why he betrayed Dominic
and me...

1675
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:34,399
...and sent his man
to Miami to try and kill me.

1676
01:32:34,649 --> 01:32:35,984
I swear you got this wrong...

1677
01:32:36,234 --> 01:32:37,402
Shut your mouth.

1678
01:32:38,444 --> 01:32:40,530
Although it's my right,
I won't take revenge.

1679
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:43,366
You wanna know why?
Because you got a problem.

1680
01:32:43,616 --> 01:32:45,326
A problem with aggression.

1681
01:32:45,577 --> 01:32:47,328
Maybe you weren't hugged as a kid.

1682
01:32:47,578 --> 01:32:49,372
You ought to look inside yourself...

1683
01:32:49,622 --> 01:32:52,417
...Iook inside and
find out who you are.

1684
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:54,961
Because for me...

1685
01:32:55,253 --> 01:32:56,421
...I had a breakthrough.

1686
01:32:56,671 --> 01:33:00,800
I'm in a good place mentally,
and I'm feeling good about me.

1687
01:33:02,302 --> 01:33:03,594
I don't know, Paul.

1688
01:33:04,512 --> 01:33:08,433
I can see where some people
might have a problem with this.

1689
01:33:08,683 --> 01:33:09,559
I realize that.

1690
01:33:09,809 --> 01:33:11,519
So as a token of good faith...

1691
01:33:11,769 --> 01:33:14,063
...I've written down a few things...

1692
01:33:14,314 --> 01:33:16,816
...putting them in a safe-deposit
box in case...

1693
01:33:17,066 --> 01:33:19,944
...something should happen to me,
my friend or my family.

1694
01:33:27,827 --> 01:33:30,121
I don't know what
anybody else thinks...

1695
01:33:30,538 --> 01:33:32,957
...but I say good luck
and God bless, Paul.

1696
01:33:37,628 --> 01:33:39,756
hank you. Come on, let's go.

1697
01:33:40,131 --> 01:33:41,924
I'm his friend.

1698
01:33:49,807 --> 01:33:51,976
hat was remarkable.
Do you feel proud?

1699
01:33:52,226 --> 01:33:56,272
Some people in therapy never
have breakthroughs like you had.

1700
01:33:59,025 --> 01:34:00,359
I don't wanna do this.

1701
01:34:00,610 --> 01:34:04,530
hink this is a civil service job?
You can just quit and walk away?

1702
01:34:04,781 --> 01:34:06,407
What are you, fucking crazy?

1703
01:34:06,657 --> 01:34:08,159
Not anymore.

1704
01:34:08,493 --> 01:34:09,577
ell me something.

1705
01:34:09,827 --> 01:34:12,997
You gonna stab me in the back like
I always knew you would?

1706
01:34:13,331 --> 01:34:15,166
No, I won't stab you in the back.

1707
01:34:15,708 --> 01:34:17,627
I want to see your face when I do it.

1708
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:20,379
I don't think so.

1709
01:34:20,630 --> 01:34:21,464
Mo-Mo!

1710
01:34:22,882 --> 01:34:23,716
Bigs!

1711
01:34:24,425 --> 01:34:25,301
Eddie!

1712
01:34:29,055 --> 01:34:30,973
It's over, Primo.

1713
01:34:31,432 --> 01:34:33,434
Now get the fuck out of here.

1714
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:43,736
Machine gun was a nice touch.
A little hostile.

1715
01:35:17,979 --> 01:35:19,355
<i>Hands in the air! </i>

1716
01:35:19,605 --> 01:35:21,190
<i>Drop your weapons! </i>

1717
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:22,942
<i>Do it now! </i>

1718
01:35:34,745 --> 01:35:36,581
I got you! Get down!

1719
01:35:40,876 --> 01:35:43,170
Get out of the car!
Hands on top of the car!

1720
01:35:43,421 --> 01:35:46,507
One fucking move, I swear I'll
blow your fucking heart out!

1721
01:35:46,757 --> 01:35:49,385
ake a pill, RoboCop! Ake a pill!

1722
01:35:51,262 --> 01:35:53,306
I can't believe this.
You took a bullet for me.

1723
01:35:53,556 --> 01:35:57,184
What doc would ever do that for his
patient? I'll never forget that.

1724
01:35:57,435 --> 01:35:58,728
You...!

1725
01:36:00,396 --> 01:36:01,522
I tripped.

1726
01:36:01,772 --> 01:36:04,650
You tripped! You tripped
over your unconscious.

1727
01:36:05,735 --> 01:36:09,322
Mr. Vitti, you have the right
to remain silent...

1728
01:36:12,992 --> 01:36:14,910
oday's my wedding day.

1729
01:36:26,172 --> 01:36:28,549
You got off easy.
Eighteen months is nothing.

1730
01:36:28,799 --> 01:36:31,594
hey found Primo Sindone dead
in a field near La Guardia.

1731
01:36:31,844 --> 01:36:34,764
I heard. Don't look at me.
I had nothing to do with it.

1732
01:36:35,014 --> 01:36:39,018
A million guys from here to Canarsie
were looking to whack that bastard.

1733
01:36:39,268 --> 01:36:41,437
Good. I was just checking.

1734
01:36:41,979 --> 01:36:43,147
Don't worry.

1735
01:36:44,648 --> 01:36:47,902
You think we could keep going
with the private sessions up here?

1736
01:36:48,152 --> 01:36:49,653
You'd like to do that?

1737
01:36:50,446 --> 01:36:53,908
I could arrange to come up on Saturdays.
Or we could do it by phone.

1738
01:36:54,158 --> 01:36:55,201
Phone appointments?

1739
01:36:55,451 --> 01:36:59,288
I do that when a patient's
out of town or in federal prison.

1740
01:37:05,836 --> 01:37:06,921
hanks, Doc.

1741
01:37:15,346 --> 01:37:18,015
I never really got to
thank you properly...

1742
01:37:19,183 --> 01:37:20,226
...for curing me.

1743
01:37:21,685 --> 01:37:25,106
<i>We don't say "cure. " We say you had a
"corrective emotional experience. "</i>

1744
01:37:25,356 --> 01:37:26,607
Excuse me.

1745
01:37:28,025 --> 01:37:29,151
You're something, you.

1746
01:37:29,401 --> 01:37:31,946
Yes, you are. You are something.

1747
01:37:32,822 --> 01:37:34,198
No, you're something.

1748
01:37:35,407 --> 01:37:36,492
You!

1749
01:37:45,167 --> 01:37:46,293
Happy?

1750
01:37:46,836 --> 01:37:48,337
I just can't get used to it.

1751
01:37:48,587 --> 01:37:49,505
Used to what?

1752
01:37:49,755 --> 01:37:54,051
It's so long since you were last
kidnapped. I don't know if I can adjust.

1753
01:37:56,053 --> 01:37:56,887
Listen.

1754
01:37:57,972 --> 01:38:00,558
How about one more dance...

1755
01:38:01,141 --> 01:38:02,768
...and then we'll go upstairs?

1756
01:38:06,188 --> 01:38:08,607
ony, can you do one more song?

1757
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:10,609
Anything you want.

1758
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:14,029
My friend told me to stay
as long as you needed me.

1759
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:15,573
I don't want to let him down.

1760
01:38:15,823 --> 01:38:18,200
<i>"World On A String, "
the Harold Arlen song.</i>

1761
01:38:18,450 --> 01:38:19,952
his is so great.

1762
01:38:21,871 --> 01:38:23,539
his is a gift.

1763
01:38:24,582 --> 01:38:26,375
<i>I've got the world on a string</i>

1764
01:38:27,459 --> 01:38:29,587
<i>I'm sitting on a rainbow</i>

1765
01:38:30,796 --> 01:38:32,631
<i>I've got the string</i>

1766
01:38:32,882 --> 01:38:34,925
<i>Around my finger</i>

1767
01:38:37,261 --> 01:38:40,014
<i>What a world
What a life</i>

1768
01:38:41,682 --> 01:38:43,225
<i>I'm in love</i>

1769
01:40:04,098 --> 01:40:05,724
<i>Good night, Sobels. </i>

1770
01:43:21,670 --> 01:43:22,712
