<i>The United States' lack of action
in Eastern Europe...</i>

3
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,827
<i>... proves that the Soviet Union's
aggression at the Afghan border...</i>

4
00:00:33,995 --> 00:00:37,158
<i>... will not be opposed publicly
by the United States.</i>

5
00:00:39,201 --> 00:00:44,537
<i>Issue: The Soviet Union continued
its recent series of military exercises...</i>

6

<i>... conducting a bomb test today
in the Bering Sea...</i>

7

9

The United States does not start fights.

10
00:01:00,422 --> 00:01:04,085
Let it be clear we maintain our strength...

11
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,059
...in order to maintain peace...

12
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,961
...so any adversary
should ask themselves:

13
00:01:11,134 --> 00:01:14,194
"Do the consequences
of attacking America...

14
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:16,999
...outweigh the potential benefits?"

15
00:01:17,174 --> 00:01:19,802
As a result of the Soviet activity...

16
00:01:19,976 --> 00:01:22,774
...the watchdog group
of nuclear scientists...

17
00:01:22,946 --> 00:01:28,350
<i>... moved the Doomsday Clock

18
00:01:28,518 --> 00:01:32,819
Destruction by nuclear war.

19
00:01:33,524 --> 00:01:35,219
<i>Question:</i>

20
00:01:35,493 --> 00:01:38,019
On a scale of zero to 10,
zero meaning impossibility...

21
00:01:38,197 --> 00:01:40,529
...10 meaning
complete metaphysical certitude...

22
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:45,193
...what are the chances the Russians
will actually attack the United States?

23
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,667
Pat Buchanan.

24
00:01:46,838 --> 00:01:48,169
Zero.

25
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,968
The Soviets
would never risk going to war...

26
00:01:51,143 --> 00:01:54,978
...when we have a walking nuclear deterrent
on our side.

27
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,616
You're referring, of course,
to Dr. Manhattan...

28
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,881
<i>... but does Dr. Manhattan's existence
guarantee world peace? Eleanor Clift.</i>

29

stopped the Soviet Union...</i>

30
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,623
<i>... from stockpiling record amounts
of nuclear weapons.</i>

31
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,492
You don't think it's just posturing?

32
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:13,257
Maybe the reason
why the Soviets...

33
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:15,959
...are doing these bomb tests...

34
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:20,505
...is because they feel threatened
by Dr. Manhattan. Of course.

35
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:24,203
<i>Maybe the whole world feels like that.</i>

36
00:02:26,214 --> 00:02:28,682
<i>Soviet ships have violated
the territorial waters-</i>

37

Just a matter of time, I suppose.

38
00:04:38,385 --> 00:04:42,049
It's a joke. It's all a joke.

39
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,954
Mother, forgive me.

40
00:08:45,745 --> 00:08:48,715
I was a hero, goddamn it!

<i>- An act clearly meant to send
a signal to the government in Saigon...</i>

42

<i>... that violence and oppression
is not the way to peace.</i>

43

Fuck you, pigs!

44
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:11,893
Good luck, Mr. Gorsky.

45

Edward Blake. Sixty-seven
years old. Six-two, a solid 225.

48
00:11:44,332 --> 00:11:46,197
Guy was built like a linebacker.

49
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:48,267
Yeah, I saw the body.

50
00:11:48,436 --> 00:11:50,496
For a guy his age,
he was in terrific shape.

51
00:11:50,673 --> 00:11:53,335
You mean apart from being dead?

52
00:11:54,577 --> 00:11:56,067
That's plate glass.

53
00:11:56,245 --> 00:11:59,146
You'd have to step on the gas
just to put a crack in it.

54
00:11:59,315 --> 00:12:01,374
Had to have been thrown.

55
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,744
Check the bedroom?

56
00:12:02,918 --> 00:12:05,853
Yeah. Drawers opened, tossed through.

57
00:12:06,021 --> 00:12:09,081
Mattress flipped. Probably robbery.

58
00:12:09,258 --> 00:12:10,725
Or made to look like one.

59
00:12:10,893 --> 00:12:12,656
See this?

60
00:12:12,962 --> 00:12:16,193
- Shaking hands with the president.
Whoa.

61
00:12:16,365 --> 00:12:18,596
Think Blake was a spook?

62
00:12:18,768 --> 00:12:22,431
Government or black ops?

63
00:12:22,739 --> 00:12:24,639
I think...

64
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:28,240
...this is way bigger than both of us.

Must've been the wind. Next time you-

92
00:16:06,974 --> 00:16:13,209
It all started with the gangs.
You know, people tend to forget that.

Pirate outfits, ghosts.

They thought it was funny:
Dress up and pull heists.

95
00:16:21,456 --> 00:16:24,152
As soon as we'd arrest them,
they'd be back on the street.

96
00:16:24,326 --> 00:16:28,160
Nobody could pick them out of a lineup
because of the damn masks.

97
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,594
So a few of us cops, we get together...

we'll mask up, too.

We'll finish what the law couldn't.

Well, my point is that we had it too easy.
It wasn't fair what happened to you guys-

109
00:17:15,446 --> 00:17:19,576
You guys who picked up where we left off.
- With Nixon forcing you out.

110
00:17:20,618 --> 00:17:25,078
Nixon, oh, that prick. To think I voted
for that prick five times.

111
00:17:25,256 --> 00:17:27,986
Hey, it was him or the commies, right?

112
00:17:30,795 --> 00:17:34,595
Oh, wow, it's almost midnight.
Gotta go.

113
00:17:36,134 --> 00:17:37,761

131
00:18:27,955 --> 00:18:29,820
You ever miss it?

132
00:18:31,025 --> 00:18:33,118
No. You?

133
00:18:33,694 --> 00:18:35,492
Oh, heck, no.

134
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:38,561
Be seeing you.

135
00:19:52,344 --> 00:19:53,641
Hello, Daniel.

136
00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:55,472
Rorschach.

137
00:19:56,549 --> 00:20:00,849
Helped myself to some beans.
Hope you don't mind.

138
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,454
No, no. Course not.

139
00:20:05,057 --> 00:20:07,617
You want me to heat those up for you?

140
00:20:07,793 --> 00:20:09,317
Fine like this.

141
00:20:10,896 --> 00:20:12,090
How have you been keeping?

142
00:20:16,469 --> 00:20:18,266
Out of prison.

143
00:20:19,972 --> 00:20:22,203
Heard about you on the news.

144
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:25,039
Say you attacked a cop.

145
00:20:25,212 --> 00:20:27,976
Minor wound.
Won't need hospitalization.

146
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:30,009
Daniel...

147
00:20:30,183 --> 00:20:31,480
...look at this.

148
00:20:37,257 --> 00:20:39,885
Is this bean juice?
Human bean juice.

149
00:20:40,594 --> 00:20:45,089
Badge belonged to the Comedian.
Blood too. He's dead.

150
00:20:47,101 --> 00:20:48,569
Let's talk downstairs.

151
00:20:57,479 --> 00:20:59,242
It could have been a burglary.

152
00:20:59,415 --> 00:21:02,111
Maybe the killer didn't know
who the Comedian was.

153
00:21:02,284 --> 00:21:07,017
An ordinary burglar?
Kill the Comedian? Ridiculous.

154
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:12,026
I heard he'd been working
for the government since '77...

155
00:21:12,194 --> 00:21:15,357
...knocking over Marxist republics
in South America.

156
00:21:15,532 --> 00:21:18,467
Maybe it was a political killing
or something.

157
00:21:18,635 --> 00:21:19,897
Maybe.

158
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:23,334
Maybe someone's picking off
costumed heroes.

159
00:21:23,506 --> 00:21:25,599
You don't think that's a little paranoid?

160
00:21:25,775 --> 00:21:28,335
That what they say about me now?

161
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,840
Paranoid?

162
00:21:30,013 --> 00:21:32,846
Look, Comedian made
a lot of enemies over the years...

163
00:21:33,016 --> 00:21:34,506
...even among his friends.

164
00:21:34,684 --> 00:21:36,845
Speaking of friends, how's Hollis Mason?

165
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,679
He wrote that book. Said some bad things
about the Comedian in it.

166
00:21:41,858 --> 00:21:45,920
I don't like what you're implying,
and I like being followed even less.

167
00:21:46,464 --> 00:21:50,924
Maybe I was keeping an eye on you,
in case someone's gunning for masks.

168
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:55,765
- You were never that sentimental.
- Attack on one is attack on all of us.

169
00:21:56,207 --> 00:21:58,641
What do you suggest we do about it?

170
00:21:59,543 --> 00:22:00,703
Retribution.

171
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:05,411
- Watchmen are over.
- Says Tricky Dick.

172
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,346
Says me.

173
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:11,582
Nobody knows who you are.

174
00:22:11,756 --> 00:22:14,725
You can give it up,
try and have a normal life.

175
00:22:14,893 --> 00:22:18,795
That what you have now?
A normal life?

176
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:23,165
When you walk down the street
in a city dying of rabies...

177
00:22:23,335 --> 00:22:24,802
...past the human cockroaches...

178
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,734
...talking about their heroin
and child pornography...

179
00:22:27,906 --> 00:22:29,430
...do you really feel normal?

180
00:22:30,575 --> 00:22:33,339
Least I'm not the one
still hiding behind a mask.

181
00:22:35,213 --> 00:22:36,476
No.

182
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,277
You're hiding in plain sight.

183
00:22:41,654 --> 00:22:43,815
Be seeing you, Dan.

184
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:46,791
A maintenance hatch
will let you out two blocks north.

185
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:48,688
Yeah, I remember.

186
00:22:48,861 --> 00:22:52,923
Came here often,
when we were partners.

187
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,000
Those were great times, huh,
Rorschach?

188
00:22:55,502 --> 00:22:58,733
- What happened?
- You quit.

189

<i>Why does one death matter
against so many?</i>

195
00:23:37,781 --> 00:23:42,582

and evil must be punished.</i>

196

<i>Even in the face of armageddon...</i>

197

<i>... I will not compromise in this.</i>

198
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:50,283
Mr. Veidt...

199
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,587
...to date,
you're one of only two Watchmen...

200
00:23:52,762 --> 00:23:55,196
...ever to reveal their true identity
to the world...

201
00:23:55,365 --> 00:23:57,163
...the first being Hollis Mason.

202
00:23:57,335 --> 00:24:00,327
And you've certainly profited greatly
by it...

203
00:24:00,504 --> 00:24:05,771
...turning your superhero alter ego,
Ozymandias, into a billion-dollar industry:

204
00:24:05,943 --> 00:24:09,003
Toys, lunchboxes, genetic engineering.

205
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,239
I understand there's a movie
in the works.

206
00:24:11,415 --> 00:24:15,613
- I'm not hearing a question, Mr. Roth.
I'm sorry. Do you think-

207
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:18,346
The Watchmen resent me
for prostituting their struggle?

208
00:24:18,522 --> 00:24:21,252
It's a fair question.
Yes, it's crossed my mind...

209
00:24:21,425 --> 00:24:24,452
...some of my old colleagues
might see it that way...

210
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,622
...just as you're clearly aware
that biased journalism...

211
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,393
...sells more magazines.

212
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:35,669
The merchandising arm of Veidt Industries
is funding our work with Dr. Manhattan.

213
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:38,776
We recently expanded our research facility
in Antarctica...

214
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:42,175
...in the hope of developing cheap,
renewable sources of energy...

215
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:45,339
...that we might eliminate
the world's reliance on fossil fuels.

216
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,951
Now, it doesn't take
a political scientist...

217
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,522
...to see that our Cold War
with the Russians isn't ideological...

218
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:55,183
...it's based upon fear.
Fear of not having enough.

219
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:59,258
But if we make resources infinite...

220
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:01,525
...ah...

221
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:03,794
...we make war obsolete.

222
00:25:04,637 --> 00:25:08,471
I would hope the other Watchmen
understand that...

223
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,337
...wherever they may be.

224
00:25:13,446 --> 00:25:14,811
Thanks for your time.

225
00:25:21,055 --> 00:25:23,717
- You look good, Adrian.
- Dan.

226
00:25:23,891 --> 00:25:26,121
It's been too long.

227
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:31,923
So Rorschach thinks
someone's hunting the Watchmen, huh?

228
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,465
You think it's possible?

229
00:25:34,636 --> 00:25:37,366
Statistically, one murder
doesn't equal a trend.

230
00:25:38,506 --> 00:25:40,474
Rorschach's a sociopath, Dan.

231
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:44,476
And so was the Comedian.
He was practically a Nazi.

232
00:25:45,314 --> 00:25:47,339
You know that better than anyone.

233
00:25:47,516 --> 00:25:49,712
I'm not here because I miss him.

234
00:25:49,886 --> 00:25:51,217
It's occurred to Rorschach...

235
00:25:51,388 --> 00:25:54,357
...that we're the only ones
who know each other's identities.

236
00:25:54,858 --> 00:25:56,951
Actually, the whole world knows yours.

237
00:25:57,728 --> 00:26:00,196
That's why I'm warning you first.

238
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,791
Thank you, Dan...

239
00:26:07,404 --> 00:26:11,204
...but I fear there's something
much more real to worry about...

240
00:26:11,374 --> 00:26:13,969
...than Rorschach's mask killer.

241
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,008
If the Russians do launch their nukes,
can Jon really stop them?

242
00:26:20,184 --> 00:26:23,813
The Soviets have 51,000
warheads stockpiled.

243
00:26:23,988 --> 00:26:27,185
Even if Jon stops 99 percent of them...

244
00:26:27,358 --> 00:26:31,556
...the 1 percent that get through
could still kill every living thing on Earth.

245
00:26:34,298 --> 00:26:36,664
Even Dr. Manhattan
can't be everywhere at once.

00:28:11,901 --> 00:28:15,393
Dr. Manhattan, you know why I'm here.

Yes...

...but you're going to leave disappointed.

270
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:24,140
Rorschach. You shouldn't be here.
You're a wanted man.

00:28:24,313 --> 00:28:26,509
Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre.

272

274
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,213
Whatever you say, Laurie.

275
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:33,617
What are you doing here?

276
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:36,122
The Comedian is dead.

277
00:28:36,293 --> 00:28:38,386
Rorschach wants me
to look into my future...

278
00:28:38,729 --> 00:28:41,197
...see if the killer is ever
publicly identified.

279
00:28:41,365 --> 00:28:44,459
Already warned Dreiberg.
Came to warn you too.

280
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:49,537
Even if I wanted to help...

281
00:28:50,141 --> 00:28:54,044
...my future is blocked
by some kind of temporal interference.

282
00:28:54,446 --> 00:28:58,507
- I cannot see it clearly.
- Interference? Caused by what?

283
00:28:58,684 --> 00:29:02,085
In all likelihood, nuclear holocaust.

284
00:29:02,821 --> 00:29:06,917
If the United States and Soviet Union
engage in all-out war...

285
00:29:07,092 --> 00:29:11,085
...the resulting blast wave would produce
a sudden burst of tachyons...

286
00:29:11,263 --> 00:29:16,223
...particles which travel backward
through what you perceive as time...

287
00:29:16,869 --> 00:29:20,203
...therefore obscuring my vision
of the present.

288
00:29:21,007 --> 00:29:22,406
I must return to my work.

289
00:29:22,575 --> 00:29:23,701
Wait a minute.

290
00:29:23,877 --> 00:29:26,368
What if that's why
someone wants us out of the way?

291
00:29:26,546 --> 00:29:28,776
So we can't do anything to stop it?

292
00:29:28,949 --> 00:29:30,780
Goodbye, Rorschach.

293
00:29:30,951 --> 00:29:33,215
Took a lot of effort
to get in here to see you.

294
00:29:33,386 --> 00:29:34,717
I'm not leaving-

295
00:29:35,989 --> 00:29:38,321
till I've had my say.

296
00:29:45,832 --> 00:29:48,768
Seems like there's a lot of things
you don't tell me these days.

297
00:29:48,936 --> 00:29:51,632
I didn't wanna worry you prematurely.

298
00:29:52,106 --> 00:29:56,236
If Adrian and I can solve the energy crisis,
war may be averted.

299
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:58,469
But you always say time is simultaneous.

300
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,047
If that's true,
then how can you change the future?

301
00:30:02,216 --> 00:30:07,210
If only you could perceive time as I do.

302
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,650
Please let me show you.

303
00:30:14,629 --> 00:30:19,567
Magic. Dreams. That is what I had before.
I was a hero, goddamn it!

304
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:22,796
It's not my fault you got old.
What do you have to complain about?

305
00:30:22,972 --> 00:30:25,406
I'm putting food on the table
for you and your child.

306
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:28,339
Call your friend Eddie.
Maybe he can give you a better life.

307
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:32,675
- It was a mistake. One time.
- Man tries to rape you-

308
00:30:32,982 --> 00:30:34,347
Stop!

309
00:30:35,118 --> 00:30:36,585
Your mind goes to dark places...

310
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:39,085
...and you wonder
why I keep the worst from you.

311
00:30:43,027 --> 00:30:46,463
- Say hello to Dan for me.
- What?

312
00:30:48,232 --> 00:30:51,030
You wanna ask me
to go to dinner with you...

313
00:30:52,736 --> 00:30:54,897
...like we used to...

314
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,466
...but you won't.

315
00:30:58,242 --> 00:31:00,506
You know I can't.

316
00:31:03,147 --> 00:31:05,411
So you'll call Dan...

317
00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:08,045
...which is only natural.

318
00:31:08,386 --> 00:31:10,980
You deserve the comfort of an old friend.

319
00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:46,815
Dan Dreiberg's table.

320
00:32:07,982 --> 00:32:11,748
Did you know that
he and H.J. Were-? I had no idea.

321
00:32:12,253 --> 00:32:15,313
You remember that crazy guy?
What'd he call himself?

322
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:16,980
Captain Carnage.

323
00:32:17,158 --> 00:32:20,355
Used to pretend he was a supervillain
just so he could get beat up?

324
00:32:20,528 --> 00:32:22,928
Yeah, he tried that on me once.
I just walked away.

325
00:32:23,097 --> 00:32:26,123
He starts following me down the street
in broad daylight...

326
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,099
...yelling, "Punish me! Punish me!"

327
00:32:29,338 --> 00:32:31,863
I'm just saying, "No, get lost."

328
00:32:33,008 --> 00:32:35,476
God, whatever happened to him?

329
00:32:35,644 --> 00:32:37,805
Oh. Um...
He pulled that on Rorschach...

330
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,380
...and Rorschach
dropped him down an elevator shaft.

331
00:32:46,856 --> 00:32:49,256
Oh, my God. That's not even funny.

332
00:32:49,959 --> 00:32:52,450
- It's a little funny.
- Yep.

333
00:32:54,364 --> 00:32:56,333
I'm glad I ordered
the four-legged chicken.

334
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,468
It's really good to see you again.

335
00:32:59,703 --> 00:33:01,227
It's great seeing you too.

336
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:04,564
Why'd we do it, Dan? Dress up like that?

337
00:33:05,709 --> 00:33:09,042
- No one else would.
- Yeah, but do you remember my costume?

338
00:33:09,213 --> 00:33:12,307
All that tight latex?
I mean, it was awful.

339
00:33:12,483 --> 00:33:15,452
Uh... Yeah, yeah, awful.

340
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:18,053
But didn't wanna disappoint Mother.

341
00:33:18,222 --> 00:33:22,216
Wanted her little girl to be just like her
and fight bad guys.

342
00:33:22,894 --> 00:33:26,489
I think the Keene Act was the best thing
that ever happened to us.

343
00:33:27,566 --> 00:33:29,932
Well, we'll live longer anyway.

344
00:33:33,238 --> 00:33:34,762
What?

345
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:40,234
Jon thinks, unless he can do something
about it...

346
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:43,104
...that there's gonna be nuclear war.

347
00:33:43,582 --> 00:33:45,072
Soon.

348
00:33:45,951 --> 00:33:49,285
But I don't know what to think.
I mean, it's all...

349
00:33:49,455 --> 00:33:52,515
...quantum mechanics
and parallel realities with him.

350
00:33:52,692 --> 00:33:55,456
I never even know
what universe he's actually seeing.

351
00:33:56,762 --> 00:33:59,890
He just keeps getting further away
from me.

352
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,261
Everyone.

353
00:34:03,369 --> 00:34:06,031
I can't even tell
if he actually cares about me anymore...

354
00:34:06,205 --> 00:34:08,230
...or if he's just pretending.

355
00:34:08,941 --> 00:34:11,876
If he's pretending, it means he cares.

356
00:34:16,617 --> 00:34:18,608
Hold on, I'll get the door.

357
00:34:19,953 --> 00:34:21,750
Thanks, Dan.

358
00:34:22,122 --> 00:34:24,147
- Got it?
- Yeah.

359
00:34:29,563 --> 00:34:32,555
You always get
a government escort to dinner?

360
00:34:33,267 --> 00:34:37,328
They're making sure I don't do anything to
upset the country's most powerful weapon.

361
00:34:39,106 --> 00:34:40,334
I'm sorry.

362
00:34:40,507 --> 00:34:44,410
I invite you out to dinner to catch up
and have a few laughs...

363
00:34:44,779 --> 00:34:48,147
...but there don't seem to be many laughs
around these days.

364
00:34:48,317 --> 00:34:52,117
What do you expect?
The Comedian's dead.

365
00:36:35,662 --> 00:36:39,223
Laurie? Is that you?

366
00:36:41,935 --> 00:36:44,904
Thought you'd be used
to traveling that way by now.

367
00:36:45,572 --> 00:36:49,565
Well, I'm not.
I hate it when Jon teleports me.

368
00:36:49,743 --> 00:36:52,610
Well, it beats flying coach.

369
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,971
Margarita?

370
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:57,377
Mother, it's 2:00 in the afternoon.

371
00:37:00,088 --> 00:37:01,555
Mm.

372
00:37:02,223 --> 00:37:04,521
Remember that guy
that writes me letters?

373
00:37:04,893 --> 00:37:08,192
He sent me an item of memorabilia.
It's a Tijuana bible.

374
00:37:08,363 --> 00:37:12,527
This little eight-page porno comic
they did in the '30s and '40s.

375
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,727
- He sent you this?
- Sure. They're very valuable, like antiques.

376
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:19,234
Mother, this is gross.

377
00:37:19,407 --> 00:37:21,671
I think it's kind of flattering.

378
00:37:21,843 --> 00:37:24,107
Why do you always call me Mother
when you're mad?

379
00:37:25,481 --> 00:37:29,543
I know why you're here.
I can still read, you know.

380
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,550
I saw it in the paper.

381
00:37:33,223 --> 00:37:36,124
Eddie Blake's funeral is today.

382
00:37:37,928 --> 00:37:40,920
Finally got his punchline, I guess.

383
00:37:41,398 --> 00:37:44,231
- Poor Eddie.
- Poor Eddie? After what he did to you?

384
00:37:44,935 --> 00:37:46,459
Oh, Laurie, you're still young.

385
00:37:47,238 --> 00:37:49,172
You don't know.

386
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,104
Things change.

387
00:37:51,944 --> 00:37:54,708
What happened happened 40 years ago.

388
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,145
I'm 67 years old.

389
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:02,515
Every day, the future
looks a little bit darker.

390
00:38:03,355 --> 00:38:05,516
But the past...

391
00:38:06,024 --> 00:38:09,016
...even the grimy parts of it...

392
00:38:09,561 --> 00:38:12,189
...keep on getting brighter.

393
00:38:17,703 --> 00:38:20,537
I've got spots in my eyes.

394
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,672
Stop it, Eddie.

395
00:38:27,647 --> 00:38:31,014
- Thank you, Weegee.
- Thank you, Mr. Owl.

396
00:38:32,218 --> 00:38:35,415
Tomorrow, 3:00, my studio.

397
00:38:35,588 --> 00:38:38,751
- Little place on 21 st.
- Sounds good.

398
00:38:38,925 --> 00:38:43,521
Wow, a real photo session.
Wonder how my hair will look?

399
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:49,030
Oh, go ahead. I'll be there in five.

400
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:06,543
Eddie.

401
00:39:07,621 --> 00:39:11,682
What the hell are you doing here?
You knew I was changing.

402
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,452
Sure I did.

403
00:39:15,096 --> 00:39:16,688
Come on, baby.

404
00:39:17,132 --> 00:39:19,123
I know what you need.

405
00:39:19,301 --> 00:39:23,362
You gotta have some kind of reason
for dressing in an outfit like this.

406
00:39:23,538 --> 00:39:25,836
I said no, Eddie.

407
00:39:26,474 --> 00:39:31,377
- No spelled Y-E-S.
- No spelled N-O.

408
00:39:31,546 --> 00:39:34,982
- All right?
- Come on, sweetheart.

409
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:40,513
Eddie...

410
00:40:21,366 --> 00:40:24,096
You little bastard.

411
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:31,732
This what you like?

412
00:40:31,909 --> 00:40:34,401
- This what makes you hot?
- What?

413
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:48,088
Things are tough all over, cupcake.

414
00:40:48,261 --> 00:40:52,357
It rains on the just and the unjust alike.

415
00:40:52,532 --> 00:40:56,366
The Comedian was a little bit of both.

416
00:40:57,837 --> 00:41:01,205
And he always thought
he'd get the last laugh.

417
00:41:01,742 --> 00:41:04,802
Thou knowest, Lord,
the secrets of our hearts.

418
00:41:05,413 --> 00:41:08,746
Shut not thy merciful ears
to our prayers...

419
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:13,512
...but spare us, Lord most holy,
O God most mighty...

420
00:41:13,688 --> 00:41:16,748
...O holy and merciful savior.

421
00:41:17,425 --> 00:41:20,155
Thou most worthy judge eternal.

422
00:41:20,327 --> 00:41:23,660
Suffer us not at our last hour
for any-

423
00:42:50,623 --> 00:42:53,057
Fireworks. You gotta be kidding me.

424
00:42:53,225 --> 00:42:57,958
You know, you'd think this goddamn
country had had enough fireworks.

425
00:42:58,864 --> 00:43:01,458
You know, if we'd lost here in Vietnam...

426
00:43:01,634 --> 00:43:06,594
...I think it might have driven us crazy.
You know, as a country.

427
00:43:07,373 --> 00:43:11,070
But we didn't, thanks to you.

428
00:43:13,045 --> 00:43:14,980
You sound bitter.

429
00:43:15,148 --> 00:43:16,809
Me? Bitter?

430
00:43:16,983 --> 00:43:20,043
Fuck, no. I think it's hilarious.

431
00:43:26,393 --> 00:43:28,224
Oh, Jesus Christ.

432
00:43:28,395 --> 00:43:31,387
- Mr. Eddie?
- Just what I fucking needed.

433
00:43:31,565 --> 00:43:36,628
The war is over now.
We must talk about this baby.

434
00:43:37,404 --> 00:43:40,932
There's nothing to talk about.
See, I'm leaving.

435
00:43:41,108 --> 00:43:42,439
I'm gonna forget about you...

436
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:45,444
...and your horrible, sweaty,
little piece-of-shit country.

437
00:43:46,014 --> 00:43:47,174
Get the fuck out of here.

438
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,782
- No.
- Get the fuck out of here.

439
00:43:50,953 --> 00:43:52,318
You will remember.

440
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:56,819
You will remember me and my country...

441
00:43:57,693 --> 00:43:59,320
...forever!

442
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,795
My face!

443
00:44:06,001 --> 00:44:07,161
Blake. Don't.

444
00:44:07,971 --> 00:44:09,268
Blake!

445
00:44:16,145 --> 00:44:18,636
She was pregnant...

446
00:44:19,916 --> 00:44:21,645
...and you gunned her down.

447
00:44:21,818 --> 00:44:23,080
That's right...

448
00:44:23,253 --> 00:44:25,187
...and you know what? You watched me.

449
00:44:25,355 --> 00:44:28,347
You could have turned the gun to steam,
the bullets to mercury...

450
00:44:28,524 --> 00:44:32,119
...the bottle into goddamn snowflakes,
but you didn't, did you?

451
00:44:34,063 --> 00:44:36,897
You really don't give a damn
about human beings.

452
00:44:38,068 --> 00:44:40,902
You're drifting out of touch, Doc.

453
00:44:42,474 --> 00:44:44,669
God help us all.

454
00:44:46,678 --> 00:44:47,975
Medic!

455
00:44:54,819 --> 00:44:57,982
<i>Most holy and merciful savior.</i>

456
00:44:58,924 --> 00:45:03,828
He cometh up and is cut down,
like a flower.

457
00:45:03,996 --> 00:45:08,194
In the midst of life, we are in death.

458
00:45:08,367 --> 00:45:12,667
Of whom may we seek succor,
but of thee, O Lord?

459
00:45:17,076 --> 00:45:20,136
Welcome. We'll be starting shortly.

460
00:45:20,313 --> 00:45:22,406
We're waiting for one more.

461
00:45:33,193 --> 00:45:36,526
I told you, you wouldn't be
the only one dressed up.

462
00:45:38,165 --> 00:45:39,564
Welcome, doctor.

463
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,627
Now we can start.

464
00:45:41,802 --> 00:45:45,636
Thank you for coming. Acquaint yourselves
with this map of high-crime areas.

465
00:45:47,007 --> 00:45:48,133
This is all bullshit.

466
00:45:48,942 --> 00:45:53,311
For a guy who calls himself the Comedian,
I can never tell when you're joking.

467
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,882
Watchmen. That's the real joke.

468
00:45:57,051 --> 00:45:59,849
It didn't work 15 years ago,
and it ain't gonna work now...

469
00:46:00,021 --> 00:46:02,148
...because you wanna play
cowboys and Indians.

470
00:46:02,323 --> 00:46:04,689
Maybe we should agree
on no drinking at meetings.

471
00:46:06,494 --> 00:46:10,225
Rorschach and I have made headway
on the gang problem by working together.

472
00:46:10,398 --> 00:46:14,732
A group this size seems like
a publicity stunt. I'm not in it for the ink.

473
00:46:14,902 --> 00:46:16,699
We can do so much more.

474
00:46:16,871 --> 00:46:19,066
We can save this world...

475
00:46:20,675 --> 00:46:23,839
...with the right leadership.
- Yeah.

476
00:46:26,215 --> 00:46:27,978
And that'd be you, right, Ozzy?

477
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:30,914
I mean, hell,
you're the smartest man on the planet.

478
00:46:31,086 --> 00:46:33,748
It doesn't take a genius
to see the world has problems.

479
00:46:34,123 --> 00:46:37,786
But it takes a room of morons to think
they're small enough for you to handle.

480
00:46:38,293 --> 00:46:39,453
You people.

481
00:46:39,628 --> 00:46:43,086
You hear Moloch's back in town,
get your panties all in a bunch.

482
00:46:43,265 --> 00:46:46,099
- You think catching him matters?
- Justice matters.

483
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:49,502
Justice.

484
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,132
Justice is coming to all of us.

485
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,776
No matter what the fuck we do.

486
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:58,448
You know, mankind's been trying to kill
each other off since the beginning of time.

487
00:46:58,616 --> 00:47:03,452
Now we finally have the power
to finish the job.

488
00:47:03,688 --> 00:47:07,317
Ain't nothing gonna matter once
those nukes start flying. We'll all be dust.

489
00:47:10,462 --> 00:47:12,487
Then Ozymandias here...

490
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:15,762
...will be the smartest man
on the cinder.

491
00:47:24,677 --> 00:47:26,736
<i>For as much as it hath pleased...</i>

492
00:47:27,613 --> 00:47:31,879
...almighty God to take onto himself
the soul of our dear departed brother...

493
00:47:33,286 --> 00:47:37,347
...let us therefore commit his body
to the ground.

494
00:47:37,523 --> 00:47:40,981
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes...

495
00:48:04,751 --> 00:48:11,021
Watchmen! Police!
Police to protect the people!

496
00:48:15,563 --> 00:48:19,590
Attention, citizens.
We are trying to maintain order.

497
00:48:19,767 --> 00:48:24,204
You must clear the streets
until the police strike is over.

498
00:48:24,372 --> 00:48:27,535
If you could-
Please, there's no need for violence.

499
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:32,606
We are trying to retain order on the streets
until the police strike is over.

500
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,975
Crawl back in your holes
before you get hurt.

501
00:48:35,183 --> 00:48:37,311
- I got rubber bullets.
I want my rights!

502
00:48:37,486 --> 00:48:40,114
- You are not the law!
We want regular cops!

503
00:48:40,289 --> 00:48:41,551
No more vigilantes!

504
00:48:41,724 --> 00:48:45,285
My son's a police officer,
you fucking faggots!

505
00:48:46,896 --> 00:48:49,694
Goddamn it. All right.
That's how you wanna do it?

506
00:49:01,443 --> 00:49:03,104
There's no need for violence.

507
00:49:03,279 --> 00:49:06,408
Fuck you. Fuck you!

508
00:49:12,656 --> 00:49:14,385
Oh, this is getting heavy.

509
00:49:38,817 --> 00:49:42,218
Goddamn, I love working
on American soil, Dan.

510
00:49:42,387 --> 00:49:44,822
Ain't had this much fun
since Woodward and Bernstein.

511
00:49:44,991 --> 00:49:46,618
How long can we keep this up?

512
00:49:46,793 --> 00:49:50,388
Congress is pushing through some new bill
that's gonna outlaw masks.

513
00:49:50,563 --> 00:49:51,825
Our days are numbered.

514
00:49:51,998 --> 00:49:56,264
Until then, it's like you always say:
We're society's only protection.

515
00:49:56,436 --> 00:50:00,999
- From what?
- Are you kidding me? From themselves.

516
00:50:01,175 --> 00:50:03,370
- Son of a bitch.
No, Comedian, wait!

517
00:50:04,912 --> 00:50:06,812
Get your stinking hands off me.

518
00:50:08,983 --> 00:50:11,451
What the hell happened to us?

519
00:50:15,756 --> 00:50:18,088
What happened to the American dream?

520
00:50:18,926 --> 00:50:21,759
What happened to the American dream?

521
00:50:21,929 --> 00:50:24,056
It came true!

522
00:50:24,231 --> 00:50:26,257
You're looking at it.

523
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:30,195
Edgar William Jacobi.

524
00:52:30,363 --> 00:52:34,197
Also known as Edgar William Vaughn.
Also known as Moloch.

525
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:40,503
What are you talking about?

526
00:52:41,442 --> 00:52:42,875
I'm a retired businessman-

527
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:48,013
Lie again, Moloch, I break another finger.

528
00:52:48,183 --> 00:52:50,208
I did my time.

529
00:52:50,385 --> 00:52:53,183
I'm not Moloch anymore.

530
00:52:53,789 --> 00:52:58,226
- What do you want from me?
- Heard you attended Blake's funeral. Why?

531
00:52:58,393 --> 00:53:01,851
I just felt I should...

532
00:53:03,031 --> 00:53:05,932
...pay my respects to the Comedian.

533
00:53:08,404 --> 00:53:13,137
- How'd you know he was the Comedian?
- He broke in here. A week ago.

534
00:53:13,309 --> 00:53:15,641
He had his mask off.

535
00:53:16,112 --> 00:53:19,604
- He was drunk.
- Enemies. For decades.

536
00:53:19,782 --> 00:53:22,808
- Why should he visit you?
- I don't know.

537
00:53:22,985 --> 00:53:25,920
I woke up in my bedroom
and there he was.

538
00:53:26,088 --> 00:53:28,056
He was upset.

539
00:53:28,624 --> 00:53:30,148
He was crying.

540
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,959
Crying? The Comedian?

541
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:36,122
<i>He was babbling, not making any sense.</i>

542
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:39,292
<i>I was pissing in my pants.</i>

543
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:41,768
<i>I thought he was gonna kill me.</i>

544
00:53:41,939 --> 00:53:44,203
<i>What did he say?</i>

545
00:53:45,509 --> 00:53:47,170
It's a joke.

546
00:53:47,911 --> 00:53:50,471
It's all a fucking joke.

547
00:53:52,516 --> 00:53:54,916
You know, I thought I knew how it was.

548
00:53:55,085 --> 00:53:58,111
I thought I knew how the world was.

549
00:53:59,256 --> 00:54:01,919
I've done some bad things.

550
00:54:02,594 --> 00:54:06,189
I did bad things to women. I shot kids.

551
00:54:06,364 --> 00:54:08,628
In 'Nam, you know.

552
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,633
But that was fucking war.

553
00:54:11,603 --> 00:54:12,934
This...

554
00:54:13,606 --> 00:54:16,268
I never done anything like this.

555
00:54:18,944 --> 00:54:21,879
God, here I am...

556
00:54:22,047 --> 00:54:24,140
...spilling my guts...

557
00:54:24,617 --> 00:54:26,107
...to one of my archenemies.

558
00:54:28,288 --> 00:54:30,620
But the truth is...

559
00:54:31,224 --> 00:54:35,820
...you're the closest thing to a friend I got.
What the fuck does that say?

560
00:54:39,733 --> 00:54:41,928
Shit.

561
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:45,131
And your name...

562
00:54:45,305 --> 00:54:47,830
...your name was on the list...

563
00:54:48,041 --> 00:54:52,341
...along with Janey, you know,
whatever the fuck her name is.

564
00:54:52,512 --> 00:54:54,947
Manhattan's old girl.

565
00:54:59,153 --> 00:55:01,314
Mother, forgive me.

566
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:04,151
<i>And then he left.</i>

567
00:55:05,159 --> 00:55:09,755
<i>I swear I don't know
what the hell he was talking about.</i>

568
00:55:16,504 --> 00:55:18,472
Funny story.

569
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,273
Sounds unbelievable.

570
00:55:22,044 --> 00:55:23,978
Probably true.

571
00:55:24,146 --> 00:55:26,842
So that's it?

572
00:55:27,015 --> 00:55:31,145
- I'm clean?
- You?

573
00:55:32,354 --> 00:55:33,685
Clean?

574
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:39,719
Amygdalin.

575
00:55:39,895 --> 00:55:42,591
This phony medication
made from apricot pits.

576
00:55:42,764 --> 00:55:45,996
- It's illegal.
- Come on.

577
00:55:47,871 --> 00:55:50,203
Please don't confiscate that.

578
00:55:51,041 --> 00:55:53,839
I'm trying anything.

579
00:55:55,312 --> 00:55:56,802
I have cancer.

580
00:55:57,815 --> 00:55:59,146
What kind of cancer?

581
00:56:01,051 --> 00:56:04,077
You know the kind
you eventually get better from?

582
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:07,981
That ain't the kind I got.

583
00:56:11,228 --> 00:56:15,188
<i>Rorschach's journal. October 16th.</i>

584

Want some of this?
Fifty bucks, I'll suck your cock.

585
00:56:18,403 --> 00:56:21,167
<i>- Thought about Moloch's story.

00:56:21,339 --> 00:56:23,273
<i>Could all be lies.</i>

<i>A revenge scheme
planned during his years behind bars.</i>

588

Fuck you. I make more in a week
than you make in a year, you fucking homo.

589
00:56:33,184 --> 00:56:34,776
<i>But if it's true...</i>

590
00:56:34,953 --> 00:56:37,218
<i>... what could have possibly
scared the Comedian...</i>

591
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:39,255
<i>... enough to cry in front of Moloch?</i>

592

<i>What was it he saw?</i>

593
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:45,091
<i>And that list he mentioned.</i>

594
00:56:49,269 --> 00:56:52,670
<i>Edward Blake. The Comedian.</i>

<i>Buried in the rain.</i>

597
00:56:57,611 --> 00:56:59,476
<i>Murdered.</i>

598
00:56:59,646 --> 00:57:03,673
<i>Is that what happens to us?
No time for friends?</i>

599

<i>Only our enemies leave roses.</i>

600

<i>Violent lives ending violently.</i>

601

<i>No matter how much you try

<i>... Blake saw society's true face.</i>

<i>Chose to be a parody of it. A joke.</i>

606
00:57:31,479 --> 00:57:33,140
<i>I heard joke once.</i>

<i>Man goes to doctor, says he's depressed.</i>

What time do you have to be
at your interview?

620
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:26,862
Don't worry.

621

Please don't be upset.

No.

627
00:59:10,751 --> 00:59:13,720
I don't- No.

628

I don't want that.

629
00:59:17,658 --> 00:59:20,821
I don't know
what stimulates you anymore.

630
00:59:22,964 --> 00:59:26,593
Look, I know you were just trying-

631
00:59:28,403 --> 00:59:30,871
Are you working in here
while we're in bed together?

632
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:34,475
My work with Adrian
is at a critical stage right now.

633
00:59:34,943 --> 00:59:38,106
- I didn't think it was necessary to-
- To what?

634
00:59:38,279 --> 00:59:41,806
To what? To tell me which one of you
is giving me a pity fuck?

635
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,394
My attention was completely focused
on you.

636
00:59:53,996 --> 00:59:56,260
If you think there's a problem
with my attitude...

637
00:59:56,432 --> 00:59:58,662
...I am prepared to discuss it.

638
01:00:00,436 --> 01:00:04,167
You know how everything in this world
fits together except people.

639
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:08,800
What am I to you?
Another puzzle to be solved?

640
01:00:08,978 --> 01:00:12,675
Have your men stand back.
I'm teleporting the reactor to Karnak now.

641
01:00:13,515 --> 01:00:16,450
You're my only remaining link
to the world.

642
01:00:24,227 --> 01:00:26,821
I don't want that responsibility anymore.

643
01:00:32,702 --> 01:00:34,829
He's all yours.

644
01:00:40,877 --> 01:00:43,243
<i>Don't worry, Jon. She'll be back.</i>

645
01:00:44,715 --> 01:00:46,910
No, she won't.

646
01:01:00,998 --> 01:01:05,560
<i>He's been called
many things: Hero, weapon...</i>

647
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:08,538
<i>... linchpin of our national security...</i>

648
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:13,235
<i>... deterrent to nuclear war,
or a man to end worlds.</i>

649
01:01:13,578 --> 01:01:16,138
<i>Later tonight, Dr. Manhattan...</i>

650
01:01:16,315 --> 01:01:21,275
<i>... will answer my questions and yours
in an exclusive interview...</i>

651
01:01:21,453 --> 01:01:26,323
<i>... brought to you commercial-free
by Veidt Enterprises.</i>

652
01:01:41,175 --> 01:01:42,438
Who is it?

653
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:44,578
It's Laurie.

654
01:01:55,457 --> 01:01:58,722
Sorry. I just had this new lock installed.

655
01:01:58,893 --> 01:02:01,361
I didn't know where else to go.

656
01:02:01,529 --> 01:02:04,693
Oh, it's okay. Come in.

657
01:02:12,141 --> 01:02:13,165
What's wrong?

658
01:02:14,477 --> 01:02:16,104
I left Jon.

659
01:02:16,812 --> 01:02:19,110
Oh, God.

660
01:02:19,582 --> 01:02:21,311
I'm so sorry.

661
01:02:21,484 --> 01:02:24,317
I don't know why I'm here. I just...

662
01:02:25,855 --> 01:02:28,323
I don't know anybody else.

663
01:02:29,158 --> 01:02:32,458
I don't know anybody
except for goddamn superheroes.

664
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:34,691
That's okay.

665
01:02:34,865 --> 01:02:37,129
You probably just had an argument
or something.

666
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:38,665
No, Dan.

667
01:02:39,202 --> 01:02:41,898
You don't know what it's been like
living with him.

668
01:02:42,072 --> 01:02:45,200
The way he looks at things now,
it's like he doesn't...

669
01:02:45,375 --> 01:02:47,843
...remember what they are.

670
01:02:48,178 --> 01:02:50,339
<i>It's like this world, this real world...</i>

671
01:02:50,514 --> 01:02:54,314
<i>... to him,
it's like walking through mist.</i>

672
01:02:54,484 --> 01:02:58,046
And people are just shadows.

673
01:02:59,624 --> 01:03:02,115
<i>Shadows in a fog.</i>

674
01:03:03,227 --> 01:03:06,594
<i>God, how did everything
get so tangled up?</i>

675
01:03:08,199 --> 01:03:10,190
I'm sorry, Dan.

676
01:03:10,935 --> 01:03:13,927
This is twice now
I've ruined your evening.

677
01:03:14,372 --> 01:03:17,364
Come on. I'm glad you came over.

678
01:03:17,542 --> 01:03:21,069
I was just gonna see Hollis
for our weekly beer session.

679
01:03:21,245 --> 01:03:23,236
You're more than welcome to join.

680
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:27,715
In fact, I insist.

681
01:04:00,221 --> 01:04:03,019
Terrific. Dr. Manhattan arrives
and no one thinks to tell me.

682
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:05,090
He just-
- We don't have time for makeup.

683
01:04:05,259 --> 01:04:07,557
That blue is too light for television.

684
01:04:10,331 --> 01:04:12,322
Is that dark enough?

685
01:04:14,135 --> 01:04:17,036
<i>Yeah, that's dark enough.</i>

686
01:04:17,204 --> 01:04:20,868
The weight of the world's on him,
but does he quit? No.

687
01:04:21,042 --> 01:04:23,306
News vendors always cope. They're the-

688
01:04:23,478 --> 01:04:27,039
Oh, God, here comes
that homeless guy again.

689
01:04:27,482 --> 01:04:30,280
I told you, this month's issue
still hasn't arrived yet.

690
01:04:30,452 --> 01:04:34,115
Why do you care about that right-wing rag?
Those bastards don't give a damn.

691
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:37,788
Hold up. Here they come.

692
01:04:41,564 --> 01:04:44,089
- Seymour.
- Bernie, how's tricks?

693
01:04:44,267 --> 01:04:45,291
Fine, fine.

694
01:04:45,468 --> 01:04:48,768
See this guy behind me?
Been bugging me all week.

695
01:04:51,675 --> 01:04:55,873
Maybe we should get a cab.
These are bad neighborhoods.

696
01:04:56,046 --> 01:04:59,675
Yeah, well, I'm in a bad mood.

697
01:05:12,262 --> 01:05:14,527
Girl.
What we got here?

698
01:05:14,699 --> 01:05:17,566
Here's a list of Pentagon-approved
no-go areas.

699
01:05:17,735 --> 01:05:20,533
Afghanistan will obviously come up,
but just play it cool...

700
01:05:20,705 --> 01:05:23,071
...and try not to get
into any tight corners.

701
01:05:23,241 --> 01:05:26,938
- A renowned nuclear physicist,
who, through a terrible accident...

702
01:05:27,111 --> 01:05:32,879
...was gifted with extraordinary powers,
capable of bending matter to his will.

703
01:05:33,051 --> 01:05:37,317
Today, the world knows him
as Dr. Manhattan.

704
01:05:37,488 --> 01:05:38,819
Welcome.

705
01:05:43,829 --> 01:05:45,057
Thank you.

706
01:05:45,231 --> 01:05:47,165
That's right.

707
01:05:53,706 --> 01:05:56,504
Ms. Black, you have the first question.

708
01:05:56,675 --> 01:05:58,108
Dr. Manhattan, as you know...

709
01:05:58,277 --> 01:06:00,973
...the Doomsday Clock
is a symbolic clock face...

710
01:06:01,146 --> 01:06:04,707
...analogizing humankind's proximity
to extinction...

711
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:08,043
...midnight representing the threat
of nuclear war.

712
01:06:08,221 --> 01:06:11,385
As of now, it stands at four minutes
to midnight.

713
01:06:12,026 --> 01:06:14,494
Would you agree that we're that close
to annihilation?

714
01:06:14,895 --> 01:06:17,227
My father was a watchmaker.

715
01:06:18,065 --> 01:06:22,399
He abandoned it when Einstein discovered
that time is relative.

716
01:06:23,571 --> 01:06:25,562
I would only agree
that a symbolic clock...

717
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:27,731
...is as nourishing to the intellect...

718
01:06:27,908 --> 01:06:31,173
...as a photograph of oxygen
to a drowning man.

719
01:06:33,515 --> 01:06:35,244
So you're saying there is no danger.

720
01:06:35,417 --> 01:06:39,410
<i>Even in a world without nuclear
weapons, there would still be danger.</i>

721
01:06:44,359 --> 01:06:47,260
And would you say, as so many claim...

722
01:06:47,429 --> 01:06:49,192
...that you are, in fact, a god...

723
01:06:49,364 --> 01:06:52,197
...given you see the past
and future simultaneously?

724
01:06:52,367 --> 01:06:54,665
I can only see my own past...

725
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:59,005
<i>... my own future. I am not omniscient.</i>

726
01:06:59,608 --> 01:07:00,974
Doug Roth, your question?

727
01:07:01,144 --> 01:07:03,874
Speaking of your past, Dr. Manhattan...

728
01:07:04,047 --> 01:07:06,811
...do you remember a man
named Wally Weaver?

729
01:07:06,983 --> 01:07:12,114
Yes. We were both physicists together
at the Gila Flats Research Base.

730
01:07:12,622 --> 01:07:14,180
He died of cancer.

731
01:07:15,058 --> 01:07:17,322
- He was a good man.
How about Edgar Jacobi...

732
01:07:17,493 --> 01:07:20,394
<i>... also known as the supervillain Moloch?</i>

733
01:07:21,364 --> 01:07:25,460
<i>You encountered him several times
in the '60s: Battles, conflicts.</i>

734
01:07:25,668 --> 01:07:28,137
<i>Did you know that he has cancer as well?</i>

735
01:07:29,073 --> 01:07:30,301
I wasn't told.

736
01:07:30,474 --> 01:07:32,704
<i>And what about
General Anthony Randolph?</i>

737
01:07:32,876 --> 01:07:36,312
<i>He was your handler when you first
started working for the government.</i>

738
01:07:36,714 --> 01:07:37,738
Cancer.

739
01:07:37,915 --> 01:07:40,578
You're suggesting I was the cause.

740
01:07:40,985 --> 01:07:43,977
<i>From where I'm standing,
it's starting to look pretty conclusive.</i>

741
01:07:44,155 --> 01:07:46,180
<i>Even if that's the case, it's irrelevant.</i>

742
01:07:46,358 --> 01:07:49,156
<i>A live human body
and a deceased human body...</i>

743
01:07:49,327 --> 01:07:51,420
<i>... have the same number of particles.</i>

744
01:07:54,166 --> 01:07:56,066
Structurally, there's no difference.

745
01:07:57,203 --> 01:07:59,467
All right. Let's settle down, please.

746
01:08:05,344 --> 01:08:06,572
What about Janey Slater?

747
01:08:07,346 --> 01:08:09,678
You think it makes a difference to her?

748
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:12,081
Janey?

749
01:08:12,418 --> 01:08:13,976
Your ex-girlfriend?

750
01:08:14,153 --> 01:08:17,782
She was a physicist too.
You saw each other for 11 years.

751
01:08:17,957 --> 01:08:19,481
Doug, one question at a time.

752
01:08:19,658 --> 01:08:23,026
She has cancer as well.
Doctors have given her six months.

753
01:08:23,196 --> 01:08:25,027
Isn't that right, Miss Slater?

754
01:08:40,548 --> 01:08:42,345
You were the world to me, Jon.

755
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:45,180
You were my whole life.

756
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:48,715
Do you remember how many times
you said you loved me?

757
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:50,586
Janey, I wasn't told.

758
01:08:51,059 --> 01:08:56,429
I stuck by you after the accident.
I gave you everything.

759
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,131
This is how you repay me?

760
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:08,475
- Janey, I wasn't told. I didn't know.
- Damn you, Jon. Goddamn you.

761
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:10,635
Janey, wait.

762
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:14,481
- That's it. This interview is over.
Get up there.

763
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:17,017
Get those cameras off.
Everybody back off.

764
01:09:17,187 --> 01:09:20,884
Everybody back off.
I need some backup here. Leave him alone.

765
01:09:21,057 --> 01:09:27,155
Please, if everyone
would just go away...

766
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:30,231
...and leave me alone...

767
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,799
Do you care to comment?

768
01:09:31,968 --> 01:09:34,994
I said, leave me alone!

769
01:10:00,631 --> 01:10:02,531
Jesus.

770
01:10:03,634 --> 01:10:05,226
Us...

771
01:10:06,136 --> 01:10:07,967
...getting mugged.

772
01:10:10,308 --> 01:10:11,900
Let's go.

773
01:10:17,649 --> 01:10:19,446
I'm shaking.

774
01:10:23,655 --> 01:10:25,418
You know what?

775
01:10:25,790 --> 01:10:29,282
I'm wiped. I'm just gonna call it a night.

776
01:10:29,461 --> 01:10:32,692
Oh, are you sure you don't wanna
come by Hollis' with me...

777
01:10:32,864 --> 01:10:35,094
...and shake off the adrenaline?

778
01:10:35,902 --> 01:10:39,030
I think I've had enough hero stuff
for one night.

779
01:10:40,173 --> 01:10:42,539
It helped having you listen.

780
01:10:42,843 --> 01:10:44,572
Any time.

781
01:10:45,279 --> 01:10:47,179
Take care, Dan.

782
01:10:47,981 --> 01:10:50,279
It's a rough world out there.

783
01:10:51,752 --> 01:10:52,946
Be seeing you.

784
01:10:57,291 --> 01:10:58,418
You're late.

785
01:10:58,593 --> 01:11:01,687
Ah, I know. I know.
You won't believe what happened.

786
01:11:01,863 --> 01:11:04,662
Dr. Manhattan just lost it on live TV.

787
01:11:04,833 --> 01:11:06,528
Wait, what?

788
01:11:12,107 --> 01:11:14,041
I was just with Laurie. She doesn't know.

789
01:11:14,843 --> 01:11:18,438
She's gonna know soon enough.
The whole world will know.

790
01:11:18,614 --> 01:11:21,344
<i>I said, leave me alone!</i>

791
01:11:31,194 --> 01:11:33,389
<i>I am looking at the stars.</i>

792
01:11:33,897 --> 01:11:35,888
<i>They're so far away...</i>

793
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:38,995
<i>... and their light takes so long
to reach us...</i>

794
01:11:41,738 --> 01:11:45,936
<i>... all we ever see of stars
are their old photographs.</i>

795
01:11:49,546 --> 01:11:53,380
<i>It is July, 1959, and I am in love.</i>

796
01:11:54,217 --> 01:11:55,878
That's great.

797
01:11:56,052 --> 01:11:57,680
- You can pick it up tomorrow.
- Okay.

798
01:11:57,855 --> 01:11:59,584
- Seventy-five cents.
- Okay, thank you.

799
01:11:59,757 --> 01:12:00,781
Thank you.

800
01:12:00,958 --> 01:12:05,156
Gosh, Jon, I wish he gave us a little notice.
I'm sure I made a face.

801
01:12:05,329 --> 01:12:10,323
Oh, no, no.
I'm sure that you'll look beautiful.

802
01:12:14,238 --> 01:12:16,570
<i>Her name is Janey Slater.</i>

803
01:12:17,408 --> 01:12:20,070
<i>She is a physicist, like me.</i>

804
01:12:21,345 --> 01:12:23,109
<i>I am 30 years old.</i>

805
01:12:27,819 --> 01:12:31,755
<i>We were introduced by a good friend
of mine from college, Wally Weaver.</i>

806
01:12:35,927 --> 01:12:38,487
<i>It is February 12th, 1981.</i>

807
01:12:38,664 --> 01:12:42,430
<i>Wally dies of cancer,
of which they now say I am the cause.</i>

808
01:12:59,419 --> 01:13:02,820
<i>That night, Janey and I make love
for the first time.</i>

809
01:13:10,663 --> 01:13:13,655
<i>A month from now,
the accident awaits me.</i>

810
01:13:21,141 --> 01:13:24,634
Oh, I'll catch up with you guys.
I think I left my watch inside.

811
01:13:25,313 --> 01:13:27,543
Hey. Let's just wait a second.

812
01:13:30,952 --> 01:13:35,355
<i>I cross the room to the
Intrinsic Field Center. I find my watch.</i>

813
01:13:42,064 --> 01:13:43,224
<i>When I get to the door...</i>

814
01:13:45,001 --> 01:13:46,195
<i>... Wally is turning white.</i>

815
01:13:46,369 --> 01:13:50,430
The program's locked in.
We can't override the time lock.

816
01:13:51,808 --> 01:13:53,742
<i>I am terrified.</i>

817
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:55,036
Jon?

818
01:14:00,283 --> 01:14:02,046
I'm sorry, Jon...

819
01:14:03,987 --> 01:14:05,545
...but I can't-

820
01:14:07,824 --> 01:14:09,348
Janey, don't leave me!

821
01:14:09,893 --> 01:14:11,885
Don't leave me!

822
01:14:43,929 --> 01:14:48,696
<i>It is May 12th, 1959,
when I'm introduced to Janey.</i>

823
01:14:49,134 --> 01:14:51,329
<i>She buys me a beer...</i>

824
01:14:51,537 --> 01:14:54,370
<i>... the first time a woman
has done this for me.</i>

825
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:59,575
<i>As she passes me the cold,
perspiring glass...</i>

826
01:15:00,212 --> 01:15:01,440
<i>... our fingers touch.</i>

827
01:15:14,327 --> 01:15:16,488
Yes, Jon, good.

828
01:15:16,663 --> 01:15:22,158
Now it's just a question of reassembling
the components in the correct sequence.

829
01:15:26,005 --> 01:15:27,097
<i>I feel fear...</i>

830
01:15:28,341 --> 01:15:30,468
<i>... for the last time.</i>

831
01:15:47,295 --> 01:15:49,729
<i>A token funeral is held.</i>

832
01:15:49,898 --> 01:15:52,059
<i>There is nothing to bury.</i>

833
01:15:52,234 --> 01:15:54,828
<i>Janey frames the snapshot.</i>

834
01:15:55,036 --> 01:15:58,164
<i>It's the only photograph of me
anyone has.</i>

835
01:15:59,475 --> 01:16:04,344
<i>A circulatory system is seen
by the perimeter fence.</i>

836
01:16:04,747 --> 01:16:06,214
<i>A few days later...</i>

837
01:16:06,382 --> 01:16:09,613
<i>... a partially muscled skeleton
stands in a hallway...</i>

838
01:16:09,785 --> 01:16:13,619
<i>... and screams for a moment
before vanishing.</i>

839
01:16:38,983 --> 01:16:41,008
Oh, God.

840
01:16:41,185 --> 01:16:42,709
Jon?

841
01:16:43,755 --> 01:16:45,586
Is that you?

842
01:16:46,257 --> 01:16:49,283
Nations around the world
reeling from this morning's announcement...

843
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:52,088
...possibly the most significant event
in recent history.

844
01:16:52,264 --> 01:16:56,325
We repeat, the superman exists,
and he is American.

845
01:17:02,708 --> 01:17:05,302
<i>They call me Dr. Manhattan.</i>

846
01:17:07,646 --> 01:17:09,580
<i>They explain the name
has been chosen...</i>

847
01:17:09,748 --> 01:17:13,980
<i>... for the ominous associations
it will raise in America's enemies.</i>

848
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:21,924
<i>The marketing boys say I need a logo.</i>

849
01:17:30,737 --> 01:17:33,103
<i>If I'm to have a symbol...</i>

850
01:17:35,075 --> 01:17:37,703
<i>... it shall be one I respect.</i>

851
01:17:47,755 --> 01:17:50,781
<i>They are shaping me
into something gaudy...</i>

852
01:17:51,859 --> 01:17:53,986
<i>... something lethal.</i>

853
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:01,324
<i>In January, 1971...</i>

854
01:18:01,502 --> 01:18:05,461
<i>... President Nixon asks me to intervene
in Vietnam...</i>

855
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:08,403
<i>... something that his predecessors
would not ask.</i>

856
01:18:09,711 --> 01:18:12,544
<i>A week later, the conflict ends.</i>

857
01:18:12,714 --> 01:18:17,152
<i>Some of the Vietcong forces
wanna surrender to me personally.</i>

858
01:18:20,590 --> 01:18:24,185
<i>Hollis Mason, a retired costume hero,
writes a book.</i>

859
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:29,195
<i>In it, he calls my arrival
the dawn of the superhero.</i>

860
01:18:30,033 --> 01:18:32,763
<i>I am not sure if I know what that means.</i>

861
01:18:49,253 --> 01:18:52,347
<i>You see, at the time, I was misquoted.</i>

862
01:18:52,623 --> 01:18:55,683
I never said, "The superman exists
and he is American."

863
01:18:55,859 --> 01:19:01,820
What I said was, "God exists,
and he is American."

864
01:19:02,332 --> 01:19:04,800
Now, if you begin to feel an intense...

865
01:19:04,968 --> 01:19:08,871
...and crushing feeling of religious terror
at the concept...

866
01:19:09,307 --> 01:19:11,332
...don't be alarmed.

867
01:19:11,976 --> 01:19:16,003
That indicates only
that you are still sane.

868
01:19:18,483 --> 01:19:21,611
<i>It is Christmas, 1963.</i>

869
01:19:21,953 --> 01:19:25,650
<i>Janey tells me she is afraid, and worried.</i>

870
01:19:26,291 --> 01:19:29,089
<i>She says I am like a god now.</i>

871
01:19:29,794 --> 01:19:31,955
<i>I tell her I don't think there is a God.</i>

872
01:19:32,130 --> 01:19:34,759
And if there is, I'm nothing like him.

873
01:19:39,539 --> 01:19:41,973
<i>I tell her I still want her...</i>

874
01:19:42,742 --> 01:19:44,733
<i>... and that I always will.</i>

875
01:19:47,814 --> 01:19:52,478
<i>As I lie to her, it is September 4th, 1970.</i>

876
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:56,187
<i>I am in a room
full of people wearing disguises.</i>

877
01:19:57,657 --> 01:20:01,924
<i>A very young girl looks at me and smiles.</i>

878
01:20:03,798 --> 01:20:05,789
<i>She's beautiful.</i>

879
01:20:09,337 --> 01:20:15,242
<i>After each long kiss, she plants a smaller,
gentler one upon my lips...</i>

880
01:20:15,409 --> 01:20:16,967
<i>... like a signature.</i>

881
01:20:18,346 --> 01:20:21,509
<i>Janey accuses me of chasing jailbait.</i>

882
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:27,283
<i>She bursts into angry tears,
asking if it's because she's getting older.</i>

883
01:20:27,456 --> 01:20:29,287
<i>It's true.</i>

884
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:34,387
<i>She's aging more noticeably every day...</i>

885
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:43,803
<i>... while I am standing still.</i>

886
01:20:44,741 --> 01:20:47,403
<i>I prefer the stillness here.</i>

887
01:20:48,378 --> 01:20:50,471
<i>I am tired of Earth.</i>

888
01:20:50,647 --> 01:20:52,308
<i>These people.</i>

889
01:20:52,882 --> 01:20:56,580
<i>I'm tired of being caught
in the tangle of their lives.</i>

890
01:21:19,410 --> 01:21:22,744
<i>They claim their labors
are to build a heaven...</i>

891
01:21:23,315 --> 01:21:26,773
<i>... yet their heaven is populated
with horrors.</i>

892
01:21:27,252 --> 01:21:29,914
<i>Perhaps the world is not made.</i>

893
01:21:30,922 --> 01:21:32,913
<i>Perhaps nothing is made.</i>

894
01:21:33,758 --> 01:21:37,319
<i>A clock without a craftsman.</i>

895
01:21:38,263 --> 01:21:40,254
<i>It's too late.</i>

896
01:21:40,699 --> 01:21:42,599
<i>Always has been...</i>

897
01:21:43,235 --> 01:21:45,430
<i>... always will be...</i>

898
01:21:46,004 --> 01:21:47,631
<i>... too late.</i>

899
01:21:49,108 --> 01:21:51,804
And you have no idea
where he would've gone.

900
01:21:51,978 --> 01:21:53,275
How would I know?

901
01:21:53,446 --> 01:21:56,176
Probably on the other side
of the world studying molecules.

902
01:21:56,349 --> 01:21:58,874
Our satellites have done
a sweep of the planet.

903
01:21:59,051 --> 01:22:01,349
There's no trace of his
energy signature anywhere.

904
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,817
Really?

905
01:22:02,989 --> 01:22:06,390
Miss Jupiter, did you and
Dr. Manhattan have a fight today?

906
01:22:06,559 --> 01:22:08,049
None of your fucking business.

907
01:22:08,227 --> 01:22:11,560
It is when you're on government payroll
and you're not doing your job.

908
01:22:12,398 --> 01:22:16,199
That's as close to the word "whore"
as you're gonna get with me, Agent Forbes.

909
01:22:24,344 --> 01:22:25,834
Smoke?

910
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:28,610
My apologies, Miss Jupiter.

911
01:22:28,782 --> 01:22:32,149
You know how important Dr. Manhattan
is to our national security.

912
01:22:33,053 --> 01:22:34,987
You can imagine our concern.

913
01:22:35,155 --> 01:22:36,679
I can only imagine.

914
01:22:42,931 --> 01:22:46,924
Ain't nothing gonna matter once
those nukes start flying. We'll all be dust.

915
01:22:47,369 --> 01:22:49,929
Then Ozymandias here...

916
01:22:50,372 --> 01:22:53,136
...will be the smartest man
on the cinder.

917
01:23:11,329 --> 01:23:14,423
Laurel? Laurel Jane?

918
01:23:15,966 --> 01:23:17,763
You're Sally Jupiter's kid.

919
01:23:18,669 --> 01:23:20,899
You're the Comedian, right?

920
01:23:21,105 --> 01:23:22,572
You were pretty cool in there.

921
01:23:23,374 --> 01:23:27,105
You know, your mom, she was one
of the all-time champion beauties.

922
01:23:28,279 --> 01:23:32,613
You got her eyes, you know.
You even have that same funny little mole.

923
01:23:33,084 --> 01:23:34,984
Take your hands off her.

924
01:23:35,152 --> 01:23:37,246
Hey, doll. Long time no see.

925
01:23:37,422 --> 01:23:41,017
Not long enough in my book, Eddie.
Get in the car.

926
01:23:42,594 --> 01:23:44,585
Are there no depths you won't sink to?

927
01:23:44,763 --> 01:23:48,597
Jesus Christ, Sally.
Can't a guy talk to his...

928
01:23:49,301 --> 01:23:50,996
...you know, old friend's daughter?

929
01:23:51,169 --> 01:23:53,296
I mean, what the hell do you think I am?

930
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:55,133
We found him!

931
01:23:58,176 --> 01:24:00,269
- We found him.
Where is he?

932
01:24:03,683 --> 01:24:05,014
Mars.

933
01:24:11,057 --> 01:24:13,048
Mr. President...

934
01:24:13,226 --> 01:24:17,856
...the Soviets have moved their tanks
just short of the Afghan border.

935
01:24:19,432 --> 01:24:20,660
They are testing us...

936
01:24:20,833 --> 01:24:25,236
...to see if we manufactured
Dr. Manhattan's disappearance...

937
01:24:25,405 --> 01:24:28,499
...to coax a move out of them.

938
01:24:28,674 --> 01:24:32,634
If they realize it's not a hoax,
they'll probably start with air strikes.

939
01:24:32,813 --> 01:24:36,874
If they do, they'll have Afghanistan
under control in a matter of days.

940
01:24:37,284 --> 01:24:41,983
A watchdog group of nuclear scientists
has moved the Doomsday Clock...

941
01:24:42,156 --> 01:24:44,386
...to two minutes until midnight.

942
01:24:44,558 --> 01:24:47,721
Get this shit off the screen.

943
01:24:47,895 --> 01:24:50,921
Who are these assholes to say
when doomsday approaches?

944
01:24:51,098 --> 01:24:53,566
I say when doomsday is approaching.

945
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:00,832
Now, then.

946
01:25:01,876 --> 01:25:04,367
What about the rest
of the Warsaw Pact countries?

947
01:25:04,546 --> 01:25:08,744
Czechoslovakia, Poland and East Germany
have mobilized their forces.

948
01:25:08,917 --> 01:25:12,080
But no movement yet.
They're playing a wait-and-see.

949
01:25:12,253 --> 01:25:13,880
Letting the Russians take the lead.

950
01:25:18,226 --> 01:25:21,424
Bold moves, Henry.
That's what's needed right now.

951
01:25:21,597 --> 01:25:24,362
We can't let these fuckers
think we're weak.

952
01:25:24,534 --> 01:25:28,800
Yes. They must fear the madman
Richard Nixon.

953
01:25:33,877 --> 01:25:37,336
How soon can we be ready
for a preemptive strike?

954
01:25:38,516 --> 01:25:39,540
Two days.

955
01:25:39,951 --> 01:25:43,819
We have a 54 percent chance
of wiping out the entire U.S.S. R...

956
01:25:43,988 --> 01:25:46,047
...before they get their missiles airborne.

957
01:25:47,658 --> 01:25:49,250
What would our losses be?

958
01:25:49,427 --> 01:25:51,293
Assuming conservative projections...

959
01:25:51,463 --> 01:25:54,830
...of how many Soviet warheads
are destroyed beforehand...

960
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,865
...we'll lose all of the East Coast.

961
01:25:57,302 --> 01:25:58,826
The last gasp...

962
01:25:59,705 --> 01:26:02,173
...of the Harvard establishment.

963
01:26:02,608 --> 01:26:05,873
Let's see them think their way
out of fission.

964
01:26:06,044 --> 01:26:09,639
With anticipated wind patterns,
the fallout drift would head south.

965
01:26:09,815 --> 01:26:12,010
Mexico would catch the worst of it.

966
01:26:12,184 --> 01:26:14,277
Most of the farm belt
might remain unaffected.

967
01:26:14,453 --> 01:26:16,148
Not so bad...

968
01:26:16,955 --> 01:26:19,083
...all things considered.

969
01:26:21,661 --> 01:26:23,492
Mr. President...

970
01:26:23,663 --> 01:26:25,290
...what would you like to do?

971
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:35,938
Take us to DEFCON two.

972
01:26:36,109 --> 01:26:38,100
Begin fueling the bombers.

973
01:26:38,711 --> 01:26:41,612
Dr. Manhattan has two days.

974
01:26:42,048 --> 01:26:43,845
After that...

975
01:26:44,017 --> 01:26:47,647
...humanity is in the hands
of a higher authority than mine.

976
01:26:48,255 --> 01:26:51,224
Let's just hope he's on our side.

977
01:26:52,459 --> 01:26:54,552
There must be a way to reach him.
Excuse me.

978
01:26:54,728 --> 01:26:56,389
Radio transmission, space shuttles-

979
01:26:56,564 --> 01:26:57,792
Excuse me.
What?

980
01:26:57,965 --> 01:27:00,263
I need to use the restroom.

981
01:27:21,853 --> 01:27:23,445
Don't you understand?

982
01:27:23,622 --> 01:27:26,250
The only thing that can
bring Jon back is Jon.

983
01:27:26,424 --> 01:27:28,392
If he wants to find me, he will.

984
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:31,028
I've been a prisoner in my life
long enough.

985
01:27:31,396 --> 01:27:33,091
Without Dr. Manhattan around...

986
01:27:33,265 --> 01:27:36,166
...to bully the Russians into peace,
Mr. Veidt...

987
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:40,738
...people are going to need good,
old-fashioned energy to rely on.

988
01:27:40,907 --> 01:27:42,569
You can understand.

989
01:27:42,743 --> 01:27:47,840
The world can't just quit on oil
and nuclear power cold turkey.

990
01:27:48,015 --> 01:27:50,245
You'll dismantle
our entire economy overnight.

991
01:27:50,417 --> 01:27:53,181
You're right, Lee. And why free energy?

992
01:27:53,353 --> 01:27:56,254
Well, "free" is just another word
for "socialist."

993
01:27:56,423 --> 01:27:58,391
We might have to
make a public inquiry...

994
01:27:58,559 --> 01:28:01,824
...into any past communist affiliations
you might have had.

995
01:28:02,229 --> 01:28:05,097
Mr. Lacocca, gentlemen...

996
01:28:06,267 --> 01:28:08,497
...I respect your position...

997
01:28:08,670 --> 01:28:12,572
...and what you've accomplished
as captains of industry. I do.

998
01:28:12,974 --> 01:28:15,465
You wanna know my past? Hm?

999
01:28:16,277 --> 01:28:19,007
Okay. Happily.

1000
01:28:19,180 --> 01:28:22,638
It's a matter of public record that by 17,
both my parents were dead...

1001
01:28:22,817 --> 01:28:24,648
...leaving me alone.

1002
01:28:25,653 --> 01:28:29,020
I guess you could say
I've always been alone.

1003
01:28:29,190 --> 01:28:34,094
They say I'm the smartest man in the world,
but the truth is I've often felt stupid...

1004
01:28:34,263 --> 01:28:37,756
...at being unable to relate to anyone.

1005
01:28:37,934 --> 01:28:41,335
Well, anyone living, that is.

1006
01:28:41,504 --> 01:28:43,472
The only person
with whom I felt kinship...

1007
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:46,768
...died 300 years
before the birth of Christ.

1008
01:28:46,943 --> 01:28:52,313
Alexander of Macedonia,
or Alexander the Great, as you know him.

1009
01:28:52,482 --> 01:28:55,508
His vision of a united world was...

1010
01:28:58,823 --> 01:29:00,518
Well, it was unprecedented.

1011
01:29:00,691 --> 01:29:02,386
I wanted...

1012
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:04,858
...needed to match
his accomplishments...

1013
01:29:05,029 --> 01:29:08,226
...so I resolved to apply antiquity's
teachings to our world today.

1014
01:29:08,399 --> 01:29:11,891
And so began my path to conquest.

1015
01:29:12,069 --> 01:29:15,300
Conquest not of men...

1016
01:29:15,473 --> 01:29:18,306
...but of the evils that beset them.

1017
01:29:18,542 --> 01:29:23,445
Fossil fuels, oil, nuclear power...

1018
01:29:23,614 --> 01:29:26,448
...are like a drug, and you,
along with foreign interests...

1019
01:29:26,618 --> 01:29:28,245
...are the pushers.
- Now, listen.

1020
01:29:28,820 --> 01:29:30,447
No.

1021
01:29:32,791 --> 01:29:34,588
You listen.

1022
01:29:35,827 --> 01:29:38,318
The world will survive...

1023
01:29:38,530 --> 01:29:41,966
...and it deserves more
than you've been able to provide.

1024
01:29:42,134 --> 01:29:44,728
So let's cut to it, shall we?

1025
01:29:45,003 --> 01:29:47,471
I'm worth more
than all of your corporations combined.

1026
01:29:47,639 --> 01:29:51,234
I could buy and sell you, something
you should factor into your decision...

1027
01:29:51,410 --> 01:29:57,714
...should you choose
to make our disagreement public.

1028
01:29:59,185 --> 01:30:01,619
I think you know the way out.

1029
01:30:03,356 --> 01:30:05,085
Gentlemen.

1030
01:30:07,594 --> 01:30:11,086
The toy people wanna talk to you about
new villains for the Ozymandias line.

1031
01:30:11,265 --> 01:30:14,723
- Seems all the old villains are dead.
- Mr. Veidt?

1032
01:30:14,902 --> 01:30:18,463
- I think I have some ideas.
- Mr. Veidt?

1033
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:21,438
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

1034
01:31:00,171 --> 01:31:01,866
He's got a poison capsule.

1035
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:07,000
Don't bite down, you son of a bitch.
Who sent you? I want a name.

1036
01:31:07,178 --> 01:31:08,270
Give me a name!

1037
01:31:20,392 --> 01:31:21,689
<i>Suicide pill.</i>

1038
01:31:22,795 --> 01:31:25,730
Potassium cyanide.
Guy was dead before he hit the ground.

1039
01:31:25,898 --> 01:31:27,729
Thanks, hon.

1040
01:31:28,234 --> 01:31:30,259
Then Rorschach was right.

1041
01:31:30,436 --> 01:31:32,597
This wasn't some lone nut.

1042
01:31:32,772 --> 01:31:36,903
It's an organization:
Well-funded, well-equipped.

1043
01:31:37,878 --> 01:31:39,812
But who'd wanna kill us now?

1044
01:31:41,115 --> 01:31:44,243
I don't know, but it's not safe out here.

1045
01:31:49,791 --> 01:31:51,759
So no word from Jon?

1046
01:31:52,727 --> 01:31:54,354
No.

1047
01:31:54,729 --> 01:31:56,629
Well, listen...

1048
01:31:57,131 --> 01:31:58,826
...why don't you come stay with me?

1049
01:32:00,168 --> 01:32:03,160
Oh, no.
That's sweet, but I wouldn't wanna impose.

1050
01:32:03,638 --> 01:32:07,005
Oh, no. No.
Think of it as doing me a favor.

1051
01:32:08,844 --> 01:32:11,176
I wouldn't have to worry about you
being out there.

1052
01:32:14,583 --> 01:32:15,811
Okay.

1093
01:35:08,666 --> 01:35:13,069
Framed. Walked right into it.
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

1094
01:35:13,237 --> 01:35:14,864
Never, never surrender.

1095
01:35:15,039 --> 01:35:18,032
All right.
I hope you're ready, hero.

1096
01:35:18,210 --> 01:35:19,234
When you are.

1097
01:35:41,933 --> 01:35:42,958
One...

1098
01:35:47,974 --> 01:35:49,032
...two...

1099
01:35:53,046 --> 01:35:54,104
...three.

1100
01:36:46,101 --> 01:36:47,864
Come on.

1101
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:00,113
Son of a bitch.

1102
01:37:01,082 --> 01:37:03,483
- Christ, he stinks.
- Get that mask off him.

1103
01:37:03,652 --> 01:37:06,485
- I got it.
- No. No!

1104
01:37:06,655 --> 01:37:09,351
My face! Give me back my face!

1105
01:37:10,192 --> 01:37:12,820
<i>The masked vigilante Rorschach
was apprehended...</i>

1106
01:37:12,995 --> 01:37:16,830
<i>... and identified
as walter Kovacs, a 35-year-old white male.</i>

1107
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,060
<i>Little's known about Kovacs,
but he was charged with the murder...</i>

1108
01:37:20,237 --> 01:37:24,071
<i>... of Edgar Jacobi, found shot in the head
in his home in the Bronx.</i>

1109
01:37:24,241 --> 01:37:27,267
<i>Police officers were injured
and Jacobi's home was set ablaze...</i>

1110
01:37:27,444 --> 01:37:30,005
<i>... during the violent course
of the capture.</i>

1111
01:37:33,818 --> 01:37:35,116
Rorschach!

1112
01:37:35,287 --> 01:37:39,018
I'm gonna fuck you
like I fucked your mother!

1113
01:37:45,664 --> 01:37:48,599
Come on out, Rorschach!

1114
01:37:48,767 --> 01:37:50,997
<i>Walter Kovacs.</i>

1115
01:37:51,170 --> 01:37:54,037
Is that your name? Walter?

1116
01:37:54,206 --> 01:37:58,268
Well, let me explain
your situation here, Walter.

1117
01:37:58,444 --> 01:38:00,002
You cooperate with me...

1118
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:04,674
...and I may be able to convince them
that you should be treated medically.

1119
01:38:04,851 --> 01:38:08,412
In a hospital. I believe
that would be good for you.

1120
01:38:08,588 --> 01:38:14,618
But the authorities wanna put you
with the general population.

1121
01:38:15,495 --> 01:38:18,555
- Prison's a prison.
- Uh-huh. Yes.

1122
01:38:19,165 --> 01:38:22,601
But the difference is, down there...

1123
01:38:23,169 --> 01:38:24,535
...you'd be eaten alive.

1124
01:38:25,506 --> 01:38:29,738
You're responsible for a lot of them
being in prison here, Walter.

1125
01:38:32,813 --> 01:38:34,280
Tell me what you see.

1126
01:38:39,453 --> 01:38:41,114
A pretty butterfly.

1127
01:38:44,925 --> 01:38:46,756
What about now? What do you see here?

1128
01:38:51,866 --> 01:38:52,924
Mom?

1129
01:38:53,301 --> 01:38:54,666
Is he hurting you?

1130
01:38:54,836 --> 01:38:57,703
You got a fucking kid in here.
I get that at home.

1131
01:38:57,872 --> 01:39:01,399
Bastard.
I should have had that abortion.

1132
01:39:11,052 --> 01:39:12,986
Some nice flowers.

1133
01:39:18,694 --> 01:39:20,355
<i>I heard this guy's mom's a whore.</i>

1134
01:39:22,665 --> 01:39:25,395
Did you catch any diseases from her?

1135
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:30,369
Huh? Whoreson. Listen to me, retard.

1136
01:39:31,674 --> 01:39:34,905
Hey, you think she'd suck my dick
for a dollar?

1137
01:39:53,531 --> 01:39:54,657
Clouds.

1138
01:39:59,604 --> 01:40:02,334
Tell me about Rorschach.
Will you do that, Walter?

1139
01:40:02,507 --> 01:40:06,034
You keep calling me Walter.
I don't like you.

1140
01:40:07,111 --> 01:40:11,309
You don't like me.
All right, why is that, exactly?

1141
01:40:11,483 --> 01:40:12,848
You're fat.

1142
01:40:13,452 --> 01:40:16,580
Wealthy. Liberal sensibilities.

1143
01:40:16,755 --> 01:40:18,746
What you call compassion.

1144
01:40:18,924 --> 01:40:21,222
Wanting to protect
and understand the guilty.

1145
01:40:21,393 --> 01:40:25,295
This rotting society,
what it calls rehabilitation.

1146
01:40:25,464 --> 01:40:26,931
Nothing short of compromise.

1147
01:40:27,099 --> 01:40:29,659
Is it a compromise
to want to make you well?

1148
01:40:29,835 --> 01:40:34,068
There are other men in here with behavior
more extreme than mine, doctor.

1149
01:40:34,741 --> 01:40:37,710
Of course, they're not famous, are they?

1150
01:40:38,111 --> 01:40:40,808
You wanna know about Rorschach?

1151
01:40:42,283 --> 01:40:44,046
I'll tell you about Rorschach.

1152
01:40:45,353 --> 01:40:47,844
Once a man has seen society's
black underbelly...

1153
01:40:48,022 --> 01:40:50,650
...he can never turn his back on it.

1154
01:40:50,825 --> 01:40:53,419
Never pretend, like you do...

1155
01:40:53,694 --> 01:40:57,926
...that it doesn't exist, no matter who
orders him to look the other way.

1156
01:40:58,199 --> 01:41:01,760
We don't do this thing...

1157
01:41:01,936 --> 01:41:04,029
...because it's permitted.

1158
01:41:04,672 --> 01:41:07,233
We do it because we have to.

1159
01:41:07,976 --> 01:41:10,240
We do it because we're compelled.

1160
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:14,514
<i>I was investigating a kidnap case.</i>

1161
01:41:16,251 --> 01:41:18,116
<i>Blaire Roche.</i>

1162
01:41:18,286 --> 01:41:21,722
<i>Six-year-old girl. I was young then.</i>

1163
01:41:22,591 --> 01:41:24,923
<i>Too soft on criminals.</i>

1164
01:41:25,861 --> 01:41:27,488
<i>I let them live.</i>

1165
01:41:28,764 --> 01:41:34,499
<i>Broke a man's arm to get a tip.
Led me to the missing girl's location.</i>

1166
01:41:42,111 --> 01:41:44,545
<i>I knew the girl was here...</i>

1167
01:41:44,714 --> 01:41:48,241
<i>... but when I searched the place,
I saw nothing.</i>

1168
01:41:49,118 --> 01:41:51,552
<i>And then I found her.</i>

1169
01:42:40,906 --> 01:42:42,771
Fred.

1170
01:42:43,642 --> 01:42:45,473
Barney.

1171
01:42:45,644 --> 01:42:48,374
Who's gonna bark for Daddy?

1172
01:42:53,820 --> 01:42:57,085
<i>It was dark when the murderer got back.</i>

1173
01:42:58,825 --> 01:43:00,417
<i>As dark as it gets.</i>

1174
01:43:39,067 --> 01:43:43,936
Oh, God.
Who's out there? Who is it?

1175
01:43:45,741 --> 01:43:46,868
Who is it?

1176
01:43:57,587 --> 01:44:01,023
What? What the fuck?
Who the fuck are you?

1177
01:44:01,190 --> 01:44:05,684
What the fuck do you want?
You killed my dogs, man!

1178
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:15,229
You think I had something to do
with that girl? I found that.

1179
01:44:15,406 --> 01:44:17,874
What evidence have you got?
That's nothing.

1180
01:44:25,783 --> 01:44:28,582
Okay. I confess.

1181
01:44:29,788 --> 01:44:32,484
I kidnapped her. I killed her.

1182
01:44:33,258 --> 01:44:34,657
Arrest me.

1183
01:44:35,460 --> 01:44:37,189
What? Arrest me!

1184
01:44:38,797 --> 01:44:40,766
I did it! I said I did it!

1185
01:44:40,933 --> 01:44:42,366
Christ.

1186
01:44:42,535 --> 01:44:46,835
Look, I've got a problem, man.
Fucking take me in. I need help.

1187
01:44:47,640 --> 01:44:54,375
No, don't. Don't do that.
Take me in. Don't! No!

1188
01:44:59,352 --> 01:45:02,844
Men get arrested.

1189
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:06,281
Dogs get put down.

1190
01:45:14,401 --> 01:45:16,562
<i>Tremors of impact shook my arm.</i>

1191
01:45:17,971 --> 01:45:20,303
Warm blood splashed my face.

1192
01:45:21,541 --> 01:45:25,637
Whatever was left of Walter Kovacs
died that night with that little girl.

1193
01:45:26,647 --> 01:45:28,877
From then on, there was only Rorschach.

1194
01:45:30,417 --> 01:45:33,181
See, doctor, God didn't kill that little girl.

1195
01:45:33,654 --> 01:45:37,819
Fate didn't butcher her
and destiny didn't feed her to those dogs.

1196
01:45:38,993 --> 01:45:42,429
If God saw what any of us did that night,
he didn't seem to mind.

1197
01:45:44,332 --> 01:45:46,163
From then on, I knew:

1198
01:45:47,502 --> 01:45:49,834
God doesn't make the world this way.

1199
01:45:51,839 --> 01:45:53,329
We do.

1200
01:45:59,714 --> 01:46:02,081
I can't help him.

1201
01:46:14,145 --> 01:46:15,942
Hey, Rorschach.

1202
01:46:16,947 --> 01:46:18,938
Hey, you're pretty famous, right?

1203
01:46:19,483 --> 01:46:21,576
Rorschach, I heard your mother
was a whore.

1204
01:46:21,752 --> 01:46:25,313
Hey, you know what?
I'm pretty famous too.

1205
01:46:25,489 --> 01:46:28,014
- Ain't that right? That's right.
That's right.

1206
01:46:29,661 --> 01:46:32,893
Maybe I can give you an autograph.
What you say, big boy?

1207
01:46:48,114 --> 01:46:51,676
None of you seem to understand.
I'm not locked in here with you.

1208
01:46:51,852 --> 01:46:53,945
All right, that's it!

1209
01:46:54,788 --> 01:46:57,223
You're locked in here with me.

1210
01:48:15,973 --> 01:48:17,031
Laurie!

1211
01:48:18,242 --> 01:48:19,573
Shit.

1212
01:48:20,578 --> 01:48:22,478
Hold on.
- Fuck.

1213
01:48:25,750 --> 01:48:27,240
I got it, I got it, I got it.

1214
01:48:31,923 --> 01:48:35,324
I'm so sorry. I was snooping
and must have hit the wrong button.

1215
01:48:35,493 --> 01:48:36,926
- Are you hurt?
- No, no.

1216
01:48:37,094 --> 01:48:40,188
- Okay.
- I'm fine. I just feel so bad.

1217
01:48:40,364 --> 01:48:42,355
No, don't worry.

1218
01:48:42,533 --> 01:48:45,833
It's happened before.
Comedian did it back in '77.

1219
01:48:46,939 --> 01:48:48,770
Archie survived that.

1220
01:48:49,207 --> 01:48:50,538
Archie?

1221
01:48:51,276 --> 01:48:54,734
Oh. Well, uh, short for Archimedes...

1222
01:48:54,913 --> 01:48:56,437
...Merlin's pet owl.

1223
01:48:57,549 --> 01:48:59,210
Stupid nickname.

1224
01:49:00,285 --> 01:49:03,015
How did you ever afford
all this stuff, anyway?

1225
01:49:03,188 --> 01:49:08,717
Well, my dad was in corporate banking
and left me a lot of money when he died...

1226
01:49:09,461 --> 01:49:12,795
...which always surprised me.
I mean, he was...

1227
01:49:13,466 --> 01:49:16,095
I think he was disappointed
I went into crime fighting...

1228
01:49:16,270 --> 01:49:17,965
...instead of following him.

1229
01:49:18,739 --> 01:49:25,736
Guess I was just more interested in
birds and airplanes, mythology and...

1230
01:49:26,180 --> 01:49:30,173
Plus, there were enough other guys
doing this so that I didn't feel ridiculous.

1231
01:49:31,085 --> 01:49:32,314
Like Hollis.

1232
01:49:32,487 --> 01:49:33,977
Yeah.

1233
01:49:34,756 --> 01:49:37,521
Yeah, he was my hero.

1234
01:49:38,561 --> 01:49:41,962
Man, I remember the first time
that I met him...

1235
01:49:42,865 --> 01:49:45,766
...I just felt so connected, you know?

1236
01:49:45,935 --> 01:49:48,267
To something that mattered.

1237
01:49:51,107 --> 01:49:53,769
Must be nice having a secret identity.

1238
01:49:54,443 --> 01:49:56,604
A secret place that nobody knows about.

1239
01:49:56,779 --> 01:50:01,773
You can just come down here and hang out
without anyone checking up on you.

1240
01:50:03,252 --> 01:50:05,585
Nobody watching you.

1241
01:50:08,925 --> 01:50:09,983
Wanna try those on?

1242
01:50:20,771 --> 01:50:22,432
There we go.

1243
01:50:25,609 --> 01:50:27,600
Wow, these rock.

1244
01:50:30,448 --> 01:50:32,746
They amplify the spectral range.

1245
01:50:32,917 --> 01:50:35,044
Thermal imaging.

1246
01:50:36,721 --> 01:50:38,712
They work even better in the dark.

1247
01:50:43,628 --> 01:50:45,391
You can see me, right?

1248
01:50:47,565 --> 01:50:50,227
I can see everything.

1249
01:50:52,970 --> 01:50:56,462
I remember, no matter how black it got...

1250
01:50:56,808 --> 01:51:00,939
...whenever I looked through those goggles,
everything was as clear as day.

1251
01:51:03,248 --> 01:51:05,580
This must be the way Jon sees the world.

1252
01:51:08,087 --> 01:51:10,920
We should probably head up.
Food's getting cold.

1253
01:51:11,156 --> 01:51:13,249
Put those away when you're done.

1254
01:51:22,234 --> 01:51:24,567
<i>Soviet ambassador
to the U.N. Had no comment...</i>

1255
01:51:24,738 --> 01:51:27,002
<i>... when asked if Dr. Manhattan's
disappearance...</i>

1256
01:51:27,173 --> 01:51:29,505
<i>... has fueled Soviet aggression
in Afghanistan.</i>

1257
01:51:29,676 --> 01:51:31,371
Dan.

1258
01:51:32,112 --> 01:51:33,841
Jon sees a lot of things...

1259
01:51:36,249 --> 01:51:38,548
...but he doesn't see me.

1260
01:51:45,693 --> 01:51:47,217
Well, uh...

1261
01:52:05,447 --> 01:52:07,005
Oh.

1262
01:52:40,851 --> 01:52:42,182
Sorry.

1263
01:52:44,188 --> 01:52:45,520
Come here.

1264
01:52:51,462 --> 01:52:52,724
What's the matter?

1265
01:52:52,897 --> 01:52:55,331
- If you could just move a little...
- Okay.

1266
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:57,730
Yeah. There you go.

1267
01:53:04,242 --> 01:53:06,870
Dan, what's wrong?

1268
01:53:08,546 --> 01:53:09,672
Sorry, I...

1269
01:53:11,817 --> 01:53:14,047
Yeah, I just need a couple minutes.

1270
01:53:16,222 --> 01:53:18,156
Oh, hell.

1271
01:53:19,925 --> 01:53:21,756
It's okay.

1272
01:53:23,162 --> 01:53:27,599
Maybe we were just moving too fast.

1273
01:53:31,170 --> 01:53:33,798
We've got all the time in the world.

1274
01:53:35,307 --> 01:53:37,298
We'll take it slow.

1275
01:53:51,291 --> 01:53:53,623
It's been a long time, Rorschach.

1276
01:53:54,294 --> 01:53:55,784
Big Figure.

1277
01:53:56,129 --> 01:53:57,960
Small world.

1278
01:53:59,299 --> 01:54:00,789
I like that.

1279
01:54:01,569 --> 01:54:03,969
But you know, it is a small world in here.

1280
01:54:04,405 --> 01:54:07,170
And I've been in it for,
how long now, Lloyd?

1281
01:54:07,342 --> 01:54:09,469
Almost 15 years, Mr. Figure.

1282
01:54:09,811 --> 01:54:11,142
That's right.

1283
01:54:12,147 --> 01:54:15,639
Fifteen years since you
and that Owl fella put me away.

1284
01:54:18,654 --> 01:54:19,814
So...

1285
01:54:20,322 --> 01:54:25,089
...Rorschach, that guy you burned is dying.
Could go any minute.

1286
01:54:25,260 --> 01:54:30,459
You know, by my count, there are more
than 50 people in here that you put away.

1287
01:54:30,632 --> 01:54:34,967
I been talking to every one of them
and they're all dying to get a piece of you.

1288
01:54:35,138 --> 01:54:38,437
This place is gonna explode!

1289
01:54:40,009 --> 01:54:42,671
Then, you die by inches.

1290
01:54:43,613 --> 01:54:45,274
Tall order.

1291
01:54:45,515 --> 01:54:48,006
I'm gonna tear this guy a new hole.

1292
01:54:48,685 --> 01:54:51,677
Relax, Lawrence. Soon.

1293
01:54:52,522 --> 01:54:53,853
Come on.

1294
01:56:22,383 --> 01:56:23,714
Dan?

1295
01:56:30,559 --> 01:56:32,220
Is everything all right?

1296
01:56:34,563 --> 01:56:37,498
I'm tired of being afraid.

1297
01:56:38,567 --> 01:56:40,933
Afraid of war...

1298
01:56:41,737 --> 01:56:45,298
...afraid of the mask killer...

1299
01:56:46,909 --> 01:56:50,107
...and afraid of this goddamn suit...

1300
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:52,248
...and how much I need it.

1301
01:56:53,083 --> 01:56:54,744
Me too.

1302
01:56:56,252 --> 01:56:57,549
So to hell with it.

1303
01:56:58,421 --> 01:56:59,752
Let's take Archie out.

1304
01:57:05,695 --> 01:57:06,821
You're serious.

1305
01:57:06,996 --> 01:57:09,521
I used to be a masked avenger too,
remember?

1306
01:57:09,699 --> 01:57:12,930
I'm used to going out at 3 in the morning
and doing something stupid.

1307
01:58:14,667 --> 01:58:16,760
<i>Rapid burner. Be advised, all units.</i>

1308
01:58:16,936 --> 01:58:19,496
<i>Tenement fire at 5th and Grand.
Rapid burner.</i>

1309
01:58:19,672 --> 01:58:21,003
Let's go.

1310
01:58:25,778 --> 01:58:28,144
I can see it.
All right, hold on.

1311
01:58:38,993 --> 01:58:40,426
Dan, there are kids in there.

1312
01:58:40,595 --> 01:58:42,756
Everyone, stay where you are
and remain calm.

1313
01:58:42,931 --> 01:58:45,126
We're gonna get you out of there.

1314
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:47,461
The roof's starting to cave.
Get me in there.

1315
01:58:47,635 --> 01:58:49,103
I'm gonna get you close.

1316
01:59:47,865 --> 01:59:49,230
Let's go.

1317
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:50,560
Come on.

1318
01:59:50,735 --> 01:59:52,327
All right, let's move it, people.

1319
01:59:59,077 --> 02:00:03,878
Mom, is that guy in the space rocket...?

1320
02:00:04,316 --> 02:00:06,546
Is that Jesus?

1321
02:00:06,718 --> 02:00:08,549
No, baby.

1322
02:00:09,454 --> 02:00:11,581
Watch your step.
All right.

1323
02:00:13,925 --> 02:00:14,949
We're all set.

1324
02:00:15,994 --> 02:00:17,655
Is that everyone?

1325
02:00:41,721 --> 02:00:44,019
Bye.
Bye!

1326
02:00:47,627 --> 02:00:49,185
I can't believe we did that.

1327
02:00:51,165 --> 02:00:53,633
- They'll lock us up with Rorschach.
- Who cares?

1328
02:00:53,801 --> 02:00:55,769
World War lll could start tomorrow.

1329
02:00:57,871 --> 02:00:59,202
Right?

1330
02:01:00,874 --> 02:01:02,205
Right.

1331
02:03:27,328 --> 02:03:29,228
Come back here!

1332
02:03:31,833 --> 02:03:33,528
He's dead, Rorschach.

1333
02:03:33,702 --> 02:03:37,901
While everyone's distracted, we thought
we'd bring you a housewarming gift.

1334
02:03:38,074 --> 02:03:40,235
Something from the machine shop.

1335
02:03:41,878 --> 02:03:43,505
Hey, boss, you notice?

1336
02:03:43,679 --> 02:03:46,705
None of that "small world,
tall order" crap.

1337
02:03:46,883 --> 02:03:50,114
He knows once we slice open his lock,
he's next on the block.

1338
02:03:50,553 --> 02:03:51,679
Fat chance.

1339
02:03:52,388 --> 02:03:53,514
You're dead, Rorschach!

1340
02:03:53,689 --> 02:03:57,352
We got a prison full of killers out here.
What do you got?

1341
02:04:00,297 --> 02:04:02,731
Your hands, my pleasure.

1342
02:04:04,735 --> 02:04:06,726
Can't reach the lock. Should I cut the bars?

1343
02:04:06,904 --> 02:04:10,203
This riot won't last.
I been waiting 15 years for this.

1344
02:04:11,341 --> 02:04:14,708
I'm sorry, Lawrence, but you're in the way
of my revenge.

1345
02:04:18,415 --> 02:04:20,144
Nothing personal, big guy.

1346
02:04:21,585 --> 02:04:23,576
Boss! Wait!

1347
02:04:37,736 --> 02:04:39,533
Now you find out what the score is.

1348
02:04:39,972 --> 02:04:43,100
One-nothing. Come and get me.

1349
02:04:49,148 --> 02:04:50,809
Come on.

1350
02:04:50,983 --> 02:04:52,611
<i>So I've been thinking.</i>

1351
02:04:53,553 --> 02:04:57,717
I feel that we have an obligation
to our fraternity.

1352
02:04:58,558 --> 02:05:01,618
- I think we ought to spring Rorschach.
What?

1353
02:05:01,795 --> 02:05:03,558
Someone set him up.

1354
02:05:04,397 --> 02:05:07,992
And this whole cancer thing with Jon,
it just doesn't make sense.

1355
02:05:08,168 --> 02:05:10,102
You didn't get it.

1356
02:05:10,403 --> 02:05:12,837
Yeah, but breaking
into a maximum-security prison...

1357
02:05:13,006 --> 02:05:16,669
...is a little different than putting out a fire.
- Yeah, you're right.

1358
02:05:17,577 --> 02:05:19,409
It'll be more fun.

1359
02:05:23,584 --> 02:05:26,576
Hurry, Lloyd. I wanna
smell this son of a bitch cooking.

1360
02:05:31,859 --> 02:05:33,588
Yes.

1361
02:05:38,332 --> 02:05:39,356
No.

1362
02:05:53,281 --> 02:05:58,116
Never disposed of sewage
with a toilet before. Obvious, really.

1363
02:05:58,955 --> 02:06:02,254
Two-nothing. Your move.

1364
02:06:05,595 --> 02:06:07,222
Get out of the way!

1365
02:06:51,242 --> 02:06:52,800
No. No.

1366
02:06:53,445 --> 02:06:54,844
Where's my face?

1367
02:06:57,382 --> 02:06:59,111
Don't kill me.

1368
02:07:02,787 --> 02:07:04,186
Your turn, doctor.

1369
02:07:04,355 --> 02:07:07,553
Tell me, what do you see?

1370
02:08:33,717 --> 02:08:35,446
Don't move!

1371
02:08:43,727 --> 02:08:45,490
Rorschach.

1372
02:08:45,996 --> 02:08:48,794
Daniel. Miss Jupiter.

1373
02:08:48,966 --> 02:08:52,367
Excuse me. Have to visit men's room.

1374
02:08:52,903 --> 02:08:54,872
Oh, for chrissake.

1375
02:09:32,078 --> 02:09:34,205
Good to see you in uniform, Daniel.

1376
02:09:34,380 --> 02:09:37,816
Should've known all you needed
was nice pair of legs to motivate you.

1377
02:09:37,984 --> 02:09:42,216
You're such an asshole, Rorschach.
- Spare me indignation.

1378
02:09:43,456 --> 02:09:46,482
Picked hell of a time
to be unfaithful to Jon.

1379
02:09:46,659 --> 02:09:49,458
Get tired of being patriotic,
or someone put you up to it?

1380
02:09:49,630 --> 02:09:52,292
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about!

1381
02:09:52,466 --> 02:09:56,334
Hey! Would you two stop?
You can argue later.

1382
02:09:56,503 --> 02:10:00,234
I had to turn the screechers off,
so we'll be drawing fire soon.

1383
02:10:04,244 --> 02:10:06,610
Stop! Stop or we will shoot!

1384
02:10:45,488 --> 02:10:47,616
Are you all right?

1385
02:10:49,060 --> 02:10:51,255
Yeah. Just...

1386
02:10:51,696 --> 02:10:52,958
...heavy, you know?

1387
02:10:53,764 --> 02:10:55,857
War, jailbreak.

1388
02:10:56,400 --> 02:11:01,269
Don't worry about it. Okay?
Everything's gonna be fine.

1389
02:11:06,277 --> 02:11:09,304
- Hello, Laurie.
- Jon.

1390
02:11:09,481 --> 02:11:13,110
- TV said you were on Mars.
- I am on Mars.

1391
02:11:13,685 --> 02:11:16,085
You and I are about
to have a conversation there.

1392
02:11:16,254 --> 02:11:17,721
What are you talking about?

1393
02:11:17,889 --> 02:11:20,551
You're going to try to convince me
to save the world.

1394
02:11:26,465 --> 02:11:29,457
- Laurie, don't.
- Dan, trust me.

1395
02:11:29,634 --> 02:11:31,295
I have to go.

1396
02:11:36,976 --> 02:11:38,967
Beautiful, isn't it?

1397
02:11:43,816 --> 02:11:46,751
Forgive me. These things sometimes
slip my mind.

1398
02:11:48,154 --> 02:11:49,985
It won't happen again.

1399
02:11:51,657 --> 02:11:53,648
That's comforting.

1400
02:11:55,995 --> 02:11:57,656
Oh, my God.

1401
02:11:58,331 --> 02:12:00,162
I'm on Mars.

1402
02:12:04,171 --> 02:12:08,039
Hey. Nice ass.
Hey, asshole.

1403
02:12:08,208 --> 02:12:10,802
Hey, let's see if that comic-book
retard's up here.

1404
02:12:11,612 --> 02:12:13,546
Hey, hey, hey. Yo.

1405
02:12:13,714 --> 02:12:18,413
You all hear? Some super-owl dude
just busted Rorschach out of prison.

1406
02:12:18,585 --> 02:12:20,314
- Rorschach?
- Yeah.

1407
02:12:20,487 --> 02:12:22,352
That fool put my cousin in a wheelchair.

1408
02:12:22,523 --> 02:12:25,390
You mean Nite Owl.
Him and Rorschach used to be partners.

1409
02:12:25,559 --> 02:12:28,221
- Yeah.
- Maybe he messed your cousin up too.

1410
02:12:28,395 --> 02:12:30,626
- Didn't he write a book or something?
- Yeah.

1411
02:12:30,799 --> 02:12:34,667
You know, he lives over a garage
right near here.

1412
02:12:34,836 --> 02:12:37,498
- Yeah?
- Does he, now?

1413
02:12:40,241 --> 02:12:41,401
<i>Hello?</i>

1414
02:12:42,410 --> 02:12:44,401
Sally?

1415
02:12:44,579 --> 02:12:47,480
<i>- Hollis?
- Yeah.</i>

1416
02:12:47,749 --> 02:12:51,651
Yes, Hollis Mason. Jesus.

1417
02:12:52,454 --> 02:12:57,085
All this time you've had my number and
you wait until our sunset years to use it?

1418
02:12:57,259 --> 02:13:00,057
Well, it seemed like
a special occasion, Sal.

1419
02:13:00,229 --> 02:13:01,355
<i>What?</i>

1420
02:13:01,530 --> 02:13:05,762
The TV is reporting there was
a tenement fire last night.

1421
02:13:06,635 --> 02:13:09,434
<i>There were trapped people
rescued by airship...</i>

1422
02:13:09,606 --> 02:13:15,169
<i>... and they say the pilot
was dressed like an owl.</i>

1423
02:13:15,345 --> 02:13:17,540
<i>And it seems he had
a sexy woman with him.</i>

1424
02:13:17,714 --> 02:13:20,308
Laurie? My daughter, Laurie?

1425
02:13:21,918 --> 02:13:25,047
I can't get over Laurie back in costume.

1426
02:13:25,223 --> 02:13:28,682
Maybe she'll finally thank me
for getting her started in the first place.

1427
02:13:28,861 --> 02:13:32,456
You know, Sal,
by the sound of your voice...

1428
02:13:32,631 --> 02:13:34,360
...you're sounding younger than ever.

1429
02:13:34,533 --> 02:13:36,831
<i>Oh. Why, bless you, Hollis.</i>

1430
02:13:37,503 --> 02:13:39,528
But that's probably just senility.

1431
02:13:42,307 --> 02:13:45,242
Well, it's been great talking to you, Sal...

1432
02:13:45,410 --> 02:13:47,776
...but someone's knocking.

1433
02:13:48,313 --> 02:13:53,308
Well, don't get too misty-eyed
thinking about old times.

1434
02:13:54,187 --> 02:13:56,018
You take care now, Hollis.

1435
02:13:56,189 --> 02:13:57,486
<i>Ah, you too.</i>

1436
02:13:57,657 --> 02:13:58,885
Bye.

1437
02:13:59,459 --> 02:14:00,949
Bye.

1438
02:14:04,397 --> 02:14:06,695
We're looking for Mr. Owl.

1439
02:14:07,567 --> 02:14:09,762
Yeah. Hold your horses.

1440
02:14:09,936 --> 02:14:11,494
Mr. Owl, you there?

1441
02:14:12,071 --> 02:14:13,470
Trick or treat.

1442
02:14:15,074 --> 02:14:16,667
You should've stayed retired, Owl.

1443
02:15:21,911 --> 02:15:23,469
<i>I hate this.</i>

1444
02:15:23,646 --> 02:15:27,878
Cowering in cave,
hiding from authorities.

1445
02:15:28,117 --> 02:15:31,314
Cops are out there hunting us.
Unless you wanna go back to prison...

1446
02:15:31,487 --> 02:15:33,956
...we'd be stupid to expose ourselves
without a plan.

1447
02:15:34,124 --> 02:15:36,388
And what would that be?

1448
02:15:36,727 --> 02:15:40,425
Once we've established a pattern...

1449
02:15:40,832 --> 02:15:42,959
...we can break into Pyramid,
see what we find.

1450
02:15:43,134 --> 02:15:45,568
Did that. Dead end.

1451
02:15:45,737 --> 02:15:50,333
I think it's a front company for whoever's
really behind it, but can't prove it.

1452
02:15:53,278 --> 02:15:57,612
We need to hit up underworld contacts,
squeeze people.

1453
02:15:57,782 --> 02:16:00,512
Sure, why don't we just pick names
out of a phone book?

1454
02:16:00,685 --> 02:16:02,812
You forgot how we do things, Daniel.

1455
02:16:02,987 --> 02:16:07,448
You've gone too soft. Too trusting.
Especially with women.

1456
02:16:07,626 --> 02:16:09,719
Okay, no. Listen, I've had it with that.

1457
02:16:09,895 --> 02:16:11,920
God, who do you
think you are, Rorschach?

1458
02:16:12,097 --> 02:16:14,190
You live off people
while insulting them...

1459
02:16:14,366 --> 02:16:18,166
...and no one complains because they think
you're a goddamn lunatic.

1460
02:16:30,150 --> 02:16:31,982
I'm sorry.

1461
02:16:34,655 --> 02:16:36,816
I shouldn't have said that, man.

1462
02:16:38,826 --> 02:16:40,157
Daniel...

1463
02:16:41,662 --> 02:16:44,130
...you are a good friend.

1464
02:16:47,001 --> 02:16:50,164
I know it can be difficult
with me sometimes.

1465
02:16:56,677 --> 02:16:58,168
Forget it.

1466
02:16:59,348 --> 02:17:01,009
It's okay, man.

1467
02:17:02,284 --> 02:17:03,876
Let's do it your way.

1468
02:17:22,938 --> 02:17:24,235
Oh, God.

1469
02:17:24,406 --> 02:17:28,776
Pyramid Transnational.
Anyone heard of it?

1470
02:17:36,252 --> 02:17:37,742
Oh, you bastards.

1471
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:41,014
I buy everyone a round
and you sell me out like this?

1472
02:17:42,225 --> 02:17:45,524
Back off, or I'll stick this glass
in your squidgy face.

1473
02:17:47,230 --> 02:17:50,165
Everybody stay calm.
We'll try to keep this brief.

1474
02:17:52,269 --> 02:17:54,430
Roy Chess. On Pyramid payroll.

1475
02:17:54,605 --> 02:17:59,100
Tried to kill Adrian Veidt. Dead now.
Did you know him?

1476
02:17:59,277 --> 02:18:00,938
No.

1477
02:18:02,313 --> 02:18:03,575
Yeah, yeah!

1478
02:18:03,748 --> 02:18:06,683
- I hired him. I knew him from the inside.
- You're a felon.

1479
02:18:06,851 --> 02:18:09,820
I was. I've been straight
ever since I got out, I swear.

1480
02:18:09,988 --> 02:18:13,719
I barely knew Chess that well,
but I was told to hire from the old life.

1481
02:18:13,892 --> 02:18:17,487
- Told by whom?
- My contact, Miss Slater.

1482
02:18:17,662 --> 02:18:20,257
Janey Slater works for Pyramid too?

1483
02:18:20,433 --> 02:18:24,392
Yeah, she was real nice. She said hiring
ex-cons was part of the company program.

1484
02:18:24,570 --> 02:18:28,267
Give people a second chance.
God, please let go! I'm telling the truth!

1485
02:18:32,411 --> 02:18:35,642
Janey Slater, Manhattan's old girlfriend.

1486
02:18:35,815 --> 02:18:38,511
Adrian might help us
find out who's underwriting Pyramid.

1487
02:18:38,684 --> 02:18:39,742
Follow the money.

1488
02:18:39,919 --> 02:18:43,184
<i>Former member of the
Minutemen Hollis Mason found murdered...</i>

1489
02:18:43,355 --> 02:18:45,688
<i>... in his apartment less than
an hour ago.</i>

1490
02:18:45,859 --> 02:18:49,955
<i>Witnesses reported seeing members
of a local gang known as the Knot-Tops...</i>

1491
02:18:50,130 --> 02:18:53,395
<i>... leaving the area right around
the estimated time of death.</i>

1492
02:18:53,567 --> 02:18:56,502
<i>Reporting live, Tiffany Burns...</i>

1493
02:18:58,839 --> 02:19:01,831
- Who did it?
- I knew you were gonna victimize me, man.

1494
02:19:02,008 --> 02:19:04,135
What about my civil rights?
Just because I'm wearing...

1495
02:19:04,311 --> 02:19:07,371
- Tell me who did it!
- A lot of people dress like this.

1496
02:19:08,715 --> 02:19:10,615
Who murdered Hollis Mason?

1497
02:19:16,290 --> 02:19:18,554
You tell your friends they're dead.

1498
02:19:18,726 --> 02:19:22,287
I'm gonna take out this entire
rathole neighborhood.

1499
02:19:22,463 --> 02:19:24,954
I'll break your neck!

1500
02:19:25,533 --> 02:19:28,526
Daniel, not in front of the civilians.

1501
02:19:29,137 --> 02:19:31,970
Oh, goddamn. Goddamn, Hollis.

1502
02:19:41,985 --> 02:19:45,148
This is where we hold our conversation.

1503
02:19:45,755 --> 02:19:49,657
In it, you reveal to me that you and
Dreiberg have been sleeping together.

1504
02:19:50,827 --> 02:19:54,194
- You know about me and Dan?
- Not yet.

1505
02:19:54,497 --> 02:19:57,330
But in a few moments
you're going to tell me.

1506
02:19:59,669 --> 02:20:04,697
If you already know the future, then why
were you surprised when I left you?

1507
02:20:04,874 --> 02:20:07,070
Or when that reporter ambushed you?

1508
02:20:07,244 --> 02:20:10,873
Why even argue about it
if you already know how this is gonna end?

1509
02:20:12,049 --> 02:20:14,313
I have no choice.

1510
02:20:15,619 --> 02:20:18,554
Everything is preordained.

1511
02:20:18,722 --> 02:20:21,055
Even my responses.

1512
02:20:22,027 --> 02:20:25,622
And you're just going through
the motions.

1513
02:20:25,797 --> 02:20:29,198
The most powerful thing in the universe
is still just a puppet.

1514
02:20:32,337 --> 02:20:35,000
We are all puppets, Laurie.

1515
02:20:35,942 --> 02:20:38,433
I'm just a puppet
who can see the strings.

1516
02:20:38,611 --> 02:20:40,306
And what if you're wrong?

1517
02:20:40,479 --> 02:20:44,973
Why does my perception of time
distress you so?

1518
02:20:45,151 --> 02:20:47,051
Because it's inhuman.

1519
02:20:47,219 --> 02:20:49,619
Because it makes me insane.

1520
02:20:49,789 --> 02:20:53,691
You always say you wanna comfort me.
Well, it isn't working.

1521
02:21:01,101 --> 02:21:03,592
Look, I don't wanna fight.

1522
02:21:05,105 --> 02:21:07,835
I'm sorry I slept with Dan.

1523
02:21:08,408 --> 02:21:10,433
You slept with Dan?

1524
02:21:12,145 --> 02:21:15,137
You just said that you already
knew about that.

1525
02:21:15,849 --> 02:21:19,842
I said often...

1526
02:21:20,520 --> 02:21:24,854
...that you were my only
remaining link to humanity.

1527
02:21:27,295 --> 02:21:28,785
Why would I save a world...

1528
02:21:28,963 --> 02:21:31,090
...I no longer have any stake in?

1529
02:21:33,201 --> 02:21:35,260
Then do it for me.

1530
02:21:36,137 --> 02:21:37,536
If you really care.

1531
02:21:37,705 --> 02:21:41,141
When you left me, I left Earth.

1532
02:21:41,309 --> 02:21:44,210
Does that not show you that I care?

1533
02:21:47,415 --> 02:21:50,350
My red world here, now...

1534
02:21:51,352 --> 02:21:54,254
...means more to me than your blue one.

1535
02:21:55,024 --> 02:21:56,753
Let me show you.

1536
02:22:14,877 --> 02:22:17,812
<i>Bombers are fueled and ready, sir.</i>

1537
02:22:27,158 --> 02:22:29,388
It's time, gentlemen.

1538
02:22:31,495 --> 02:22:33,895
Take us to DEFCON one.

1539
02:22:41,172 --> 02:22:44,267
Not in penthouse. Not in office.

1540
02:22:44,443 --> 02:22:47,344
What nocturnal proclivities
entice a man with everything...

1541
02:22:47,512 --> 02:22:49,276
...out into the night at this hour?

1542
02:22:51,350 --> 02:22:53,215
Daniel?

1543
02:22:54,454 --> 02:22:56,217
You with me?

1544
02:22:57,023 --> 02:23:00,151
- Yeah.
- Then what are you doing?

1545
02:23:02,261 --> 02:23:04,024
I'm gonna look for Adrian's itinerary.

1546
02:23:04,197 --> 02:23:06,961
Maybe he keeps on file.

1547
02:23:11,471 --> 02:23:13,939
- Something's not right.
- Agreed.

1548
02:23:14,107 --> 02:23:18,875
Janey Slater, Moloch, Roy Chess
all work for Pyramid.

1549
02:23:19,046 --> 02:23:23,676
Moloch said the Comedian mentioned list
with his and Slater's name on it.

1550
02:23:23,851 --> 02:23:27,150
Whoever owns Pyramid
could be giving these people cancer.

1551
02:23:27,321 --> 02:23:29,789
Setting Manhattan up.

1552
02:23:43,938 --> 02:23:45,098
Funny.

1553
02:23:45,273 --> 02:23:48,765
Ancient pharaohs looked forward
to the end of the world.

1554
02:23:48,943 --> 02:23:53,971
Believed cadavers would rise,
reclaim hearts from golden jars.

1555
02:23:54,616 --> 02:23:57,244
Must currently be holding breath
in anticipation.

1556
02:23:57,418 --> 02:23:58,646
Pharaohs?

1557
02:24:05,527 --> 02:24:07,552
Got a psych profile on Manhattan.

1558
02:24:08,196 --> 02:24:10,665
See what the corporate head-peepers say.

1559
02:24:12,701 --> 02:24:15,226
"Subject continues
to retreat emotionally.

1560
02:24:17,540 --> 02:24:20,600
If the only remaining ties
were to be severed...

1561
02:24:21,210 --> 02:24:25,169
...we predict total detachment
from the human condition."

1562
02:24:29,285 --> 02:24:31,048
I'm in.

1563
02:24:59,916 --> 02:25:01,247
No.

1564
02:25:03,421 --> 02:25:09,190
Congratulations, Mr. Veidt.
Dr. Manhattan's energy reactor is online.

1565
02:25:09,361 --> 02:25:13,229
Your support and your enthusiasm...

1566
02:25:13,398 --> 02:25:15,696
...is what has led to this triumph.

1567
02:25:15,868 --> 02:25:19,895
On behalf of the research team,
we salute you.

1568
02:25:20,072 --> 02:25:22,506
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1569
02:25:23,275 --> 02:25:27,406
What in life
does not deserve celebrating?

1570
02:25:28,348 --> 02:25:32,445
This is the new Karnak.

1571
02:25:32,620 --> 02:25:36,215
This represents the culmination of a dream
more than 2000 years old...

1572
02:25:36,390 --> 02:25:42,659
...a dream now assured
because of your unquestioning assistance.

1573
02:25:44,798 --> 02:25:46,459
And for this...

1574
02:25:47,301 --> 02:25:49,633
...I am ashamed...

1575
02:25:50,804 --> 02:25:55,138
...ashamed that you must now share
such inadequate a reward.

1576
02:25:56,811 --> 02:25:58,802
To the pharaohs...

1577
02:25:59,748 --> 02:26:02,740
...their greatest secrets
entrusted to their servants...

1578
02:26:03,385 --> 02:26:07,719
...buried alive with them
in sand-floored chambers.

1579
02:26:08,590 --> 02:26:10,990
Sleep well, gentlemen.

1580
02:26:11,660 --> 02:26:14,993
Our new, peaceful world
will be indebted...

1581
02:26:15,330 --> 02:26:17,890
...to your great sacrifice.

1582
02:26:18,833 --> 02:26:21,028
Bubastis.

<i>Rorschach's journal. Final entry.</i>

1584
02:26:28,544 --> 02:26:31,035
<i>Veidt's behind everything.</i>

1585
02:26:31,213 --> 02:26:32,805
<i>Why?</i>

1586
02:26:32,982 --> 02:26:35,041
<i>What's his endgame?</i>

1587
02:26:35,217 --> 02:26:38,880
<i>I cannot imagine
a more dangerous opponent.</i>

1588
02:26:39,088 --> 02:26:42,524
<i>Used to joke he was fast enough
to catch a bullet.</i>

1589
02:26:42,692 --> 02:26:45,593
<i>He could kill us both alone in the snow.</i>

1590
02:26:45,761 --> 02:26:49,458
<i>That's where we're going now:
Antarctica.</i>

1591

1592
02:26:52,569 --> 02:26:56,835
<i>... I hope the world survives long enough
for this journal to reach you.</i>

1593
02:26:57,007 --> 02:26:59,567
<i>I live my life free of compromise...</i>

1594
02:26:59,743 --> 02:27:03,679

<i>Rorschach, November 1 st.</i>

1596
02:27:07,484 --> 02:27:11,011
<i>Can't you just tell me how
this ends and save us the trouble?</i>

1597
02:27:11,989 --> 02:27:13,889
It ends with you in tears.

1598
02:27:14,057 --> 02:27:17,653
Tears? So you don't come back to Earth.

1599
02:27:17,829 --> 02:27:21,265
At some point, yes.

1600
02:27:22,333 --> 02:27:25,268
The streets are filled with death.

1601
02:27:25,436 --> 02:27:27,495
Jon, please.

1602
02:27:27,672 --> 02:27:32,235
You have to stop this. Everyone will die.

1603
02:27:32,411 --> 02:27:36,745
And the universe will not even notice.

1604
02:27:39,184 --> 02:27:43,416
In my opinion, the existence of life...

1605
02:27:44,290 --> 02:27:47,282
...is a highly overrated phenomenon.

1606
02:27:49,195 --> 02:27:51,493
Just look around you.

1607
02:27:54,234 --> 02:27:58,568
Mars gets along perfectly well
without so much as a microorganism.

1608
02:27:59,205 --> 02:28:03,767
Here, it's a constantly changing
topographical map...

1609
02:28:03,943 --> 02:28:09,882
...flowing and shifting around the pole
in ripples 10,000 years wide.

1610
02:28:10,718 --> 02:28:12,208
So tell me...

1611
02:28:12,386 --> 02:28:16,755
...how would all of this be greatly improved
by an oil pipeline?

1612
02:28:17,224 --> 02:28:19,215
By a shopping mall?

1613
02:28:23,564 --> 02:28:27,865
So it's too much to ask for a miracle?

1614
02:28:28,036 --> 02:28:30,163
Miracles, by their definition,
are meaningless.

1615
02:28:30,338 --> 02:28:31,828
Oh, God, Jon!

1616
02:28:32,007 --> 02:28:37,070
- Only what can happen does happen.
- Just stop your bullshit.

1617
02:28:38,147 --> 02:28:40,672
Land this thing. Now.

1618
02:28:40,850 --> 02:28:43,410
As you wish.

1619
02:28:49,025 --> 02:28:50,083
You know what?

1620
02:28:50,259 --> 02:28:52,955
You can send me back to Earth
to fry with Dan and my mom...

1621
02:28:53,129 --> 02:28:55,495
...and all the other worthless humans.

1622
02:28:55,665 --> 02:28:59,101
But know that you were wrong.
You said this ended with me in tears...

1623
02:28:59,268 --> 02:29:03,432
...and look: Nothing.
Maybe you were wrong about everything.

1624
02:29:03,606 --> 02:29:08,874
You complain that I refuse to see life
on life's terms...

1625
02:29:09,613 --> 02:29:13,379
...yet you continuously refuse
to see things from my perspective.

1626
02:29:13,550 --> 02:29:17,953
- You shut out what you're afraid of.
- I'm not afraid.

1627
02:29:18,122 --> 02:29:23,150
You want me to see things your way?
Go ahead, show me. Do that thing you do.

1628
02:29:30,300 --> 02:29:35,398
Magic. Dreams. That is what I had before.
I was a hero, goddamn it!

1629
02:29:35,573 --> 02:29:38,633
It's not my fault you got old.
What do you have to complain about?

1630
02:29:38,810 --> 02:29:40,937
I put food on the table
for you and your child.

1631
02:29:41,112 --> 02:29:43,910
Call your friend Eddie.
Maybe he can give you a better life.

1632
02:29:44,649 --> 02:29:47,345
Even the grimy parts of it...

1633
02:29:47,719 --> 02:29:49,949
...keep on getting brighter.

1634
02:29:50,288 --> 02:29:53,884
You know, your mom, she was one
of the all-time champion beauties.

1635
02:29:54,059 --> 02:29:58,497
- You got her eyes, you know. You got...
- Take your hands off her.

1636
02:29:58,665 --> 02:30:00,792
Hey, doll. Long time no see.

1637
02:30:00,967 --> 02:30:03,731
Not long enough in my book, Eddie.
Get in the car.

1638
02:30:04,237 --> 02:30:06,102
Now.

1639
02:30:07,073 --> 02:30:09,064
Are there no depths you won't sink to?

1640
02:30:09,242 --> 02:30:13,076
Jesus Christ, Sally.
Can't a guy talk to his...

1641
02:30:13,780 --> 02:30:15,475
...you know, old friend's daughter?

1642
02:30:17,784 --> 02:30:19,115
Drive.

1643
02:30:25,125 --> 02:30:27,924
<i>It was a mistake. One time.</i>

1644
02:30:28,229 --> 02:30:31,392
Guy tries to rape you, and years later,
you let him finish the job?

1645
02:30:31,632 --> 02:30:34,328
What? Were you drunk or just lonely?

1646
02:30:34,502 --> 02:30:37,437
Am I ever gonna live this down?

1647
02:30:40,808 --> 02:30:41,934
Laurie.

1648
02:30:46,814 --> 02:30:48,145
No.

1649
02:30:50,151 --> 02:30:52,643
No, not him.

1650
02:30:52,821 --> 02:30:54,914
The Comedian...

1651
02:30:55,324 --> 02:30:57,417
...was your father.

1652
02:30:58,894 --> 02:31:00,589
No.

1653
02:31:03,899 --> 02:31:09,599
No! No! No!

1654
02:31:42,206 --> 02:31:44,197
My life is just...

1655
02:31:44,875 --> 02:31:47,003
...one big joke.

1656
02:31:47,178 --> 02:31:49,738
I don't think your life is a joke.

1657
02:31:51,383 --> 02:31:53,374
Yeah, well...

1658
02:31:55,220 --> 02:31:59,384
...I'm sorry if I don't
trust your sense of humor.

1659
02:32:07,565 --> 02:32:09,226
Will you smile...

1660
02:32:10,902 --> 02:32:13,371
...if I admit I was wrong?

1661
02:32:16,242 --> 02:32:18,234
About what?

1662
02:32:20,247 --> 02:32:21,737
Miracles.

1663
02:32:23,417 --> 02:32:26,580
Events with astronomical odds
of occurring...

1664
02:32:27,421 --> 02:32:29,912
...like oxygen turning into gold.

1665
02:32:30,090 --> 02:32:34,925
I've longed to witness such an event,
and yet I neglect...

1666
02:32:35,595 --> 02:32:37,961
...that in human coupling...

1667
02:32:38,765 --> 02:32:42,634
...millions upon millions of cells
compete to create life...

1668
02:32:43,104 --> 02:32:45,902
...for generation after generation...

1669
02:32:46,774 --> 02:32:49,834
...until finally, your mother...

1670
02:32:50,211 --> 02:32:51,405
...loves a man...

1671
02:32:52,046 --> 02:32:55,641
...Edward Blake, the Comedian,
a man she has every reason to hate...

1672
02:32:55,817 --> 02:32:59,810
...and out of that contradiction,
against unfathomable odds...

1673
02:33:00,488 --> 02:33:02,388
...it's you...

1674
02:33:04,125 --> 02:33:05,456
Only...

1675
02:33:06,127 --> 02:33:07,618
...you.

1676
02:33:08,464 --> 02:33:09,726
That emerged.

1677
02:33:10,299 --> 02:33:14,793
To distill so specific a form...

1678
02:33:14,970 --> 02:33:17,234
...from all that chaos...

1679
02:33:19,141 --> 02:33:22,110
...is like turning air into gold.

1680
02:33:26,482 --> 02:33:28,473
A miracle.

1681
02:33:31,987 --> 02:33:33,477
And so...

1682
02:33:33,990 --> 02:33:35,821
...I was wrong.

1683
02:33:37,827 --> 02:33:41,661
Now dry your eyes, and let's go home.

1684
02:34:09,193 --> 02:34:13,220
We got a bearing on that artificial structure.
Heat signature's off the charts.

1685
02:34:14,198 --> 02:34:17,292
- Veidt.
- I don't like the way Archie's kicking.

1686
02:34:25,710 --> 02:34:28,544
- The engines.
- They're icing up. Hold onto something.

1687
02:34:29,315 --> 02:34:31,340
Daniel, you're coming in too low.

1688
02:34:34,220 --> 02:34:37,383
Don't wish to interfere,
but perhaps should pull up sharply...

1689
02:34:37,557 --> 02:34:41,494
I know! I'm trying.
I'm trying to pull him up, goddamn it!

1690
02:35:08,756 --> 02:35:12,385
I'm gonna redirect the heat from
the flamethrower to speed up deicing...

1691
02:35:12,560 --> 02:35:15,427
...but it's gonna take a while
and we don't have time to wait.

1692
02:35:16,931 --> 02:35:18,398
You need something warmer.

1693
02:35:18,933 --> 02:35:21,094
Fine like this.

1694
02:35:50,600 --> 02:35:52,465
What is it, girl?

1695
02:35:54,771 --> 02:35:56,466
Mm.

1696
02:36:22,066 --> 02:36:24,330
Adrian's a pacifist.

1697
02:36:24,535 --> 02:36:29,165
He's a vegetarian, for chrissakes.
He's never killed anyone in his life.

1698
02:36:29,340 --> 02:36:30,739
Hitler was vegetarian.

1699
02:36:30,908 --> 02:36:35,436
You're squeamish, leave him to me.
We won't get second chance.

1700
02:37:46,689 --> 02:37:48,020
Gentlemen.

1701
02:37:48,524 --> 02:37:52,460
- Welcome.
- Adrian, we know everything.

1702
02:37:52,628 --> 02:37:54,391
Then what's there to discuss, Dan?

1703
02:37:54,563 --> 02:37:57,555
Plenty. You killed Comedian.

1704
02:37:57,733 --> 02:37:59,257
May he rest in peace.

1705
02:37:59,769 --> 02:38:02,363
Blake figured it out first.

1706
02:38:02,538 --> 02:38:06,600
<i>Nixon had him keeping tabs on us,
making sure we weren't rocking the boat.</i>

1707
02:38:07,544 --> 02:38:09,808
<i>Blake found out what I was doing
here in Karnak...</i>

1708
02:38:09,980 --> 02:38:14,041
<i>... and by the time he visited poor Moloch,
he was cracking badly.</i>

1709
02:38:14,217 --> 02:38:17,482
Even I couldn't predict he'd be the one
to have a change of heart.

1710
02:38:18,221 --> 02:38:19,745
So...

1711
02:38:20,791 --> 02:38:22,725
...I had to kill him.

1712
02:38:23,293 --> 02:38:27,059
Then I neutralized Jon. No easy task.

1713
02:38:27,230 --> 02:38:29,699
I put roughly $2 billion
into tachyon research...

1714
02:38:29,867 --> 02:38:31,892
...to block Jon's vision of the future.

1715
02:38:32,070 --> 02:38:34,334
You used his psych profile
to manipulate him.

1716
02:38:34,839 --> 02:38:36,306
<i>Got him to leave the planet.</i>

1717
02:38:36,474 --> 02:38:39,875
I've known Jon long enough
to see he isn't devoid of emotion.

1718
02:38:40,044 --> 02:38:43,946
His subtle facial twitches wouldn't be
noticed by the layman, but to me...

1719
02:38:44,115 --> 02:38:45,946
<i>... he might as well have been sobbing.</i>

1720
02:38:46,317 --> 02:38:49,445
<i>All I needed to do was tug on the thread.</i>

1721
02:38:49,620 --> 02:38:51,520
<i>The sudden flood of emotion Jon felt...</i>

1722
02:38:51,689 --> 02:38:55,284
<i>... when he came to believe
he'd given cancer to the people he loved...</i>

1723
02:38:55,460 --> 02:38:57,588
<i>... was all the excuse he needed
to leave Earth.</i>

1724
02:38:57,763 --> 02:39:01,597
<i>Your bullshit assassin.
You paid him to throw us off.</i>

1725
02:39:01,767 --> 02:39:06,431
<i>Mr. Chess gave his life
in the service of a higher cause, Dan.</i>

1726
02:39:08,574 --> 02:39:11,668
<i>I put a cyanide capsule in his mouth...</i>

1727
02:39:11,844 --> 02:39:14,438
<i>... leaving only one loose end:</i>

1728
02:39:15,047 --> 02:39:18,483
You, and your mask-killer theory...

1729
02:39:18,650 --> 02:39:21,778
<i>... one you followed
with the tenacity of a true sociopath.</i>

1730
02:39:21,954 --> 02:39:23,650
<i>I tipped off the police.</i>

1731
02:39:23,823 --> 02:39:26,223
Once you were in prison,
I was able to move forward.

1732
02:39:26,392 --> 02:39:29,021
Sorry to disappoint you.

1733
02:39:42,209 --> 02:39:44,677
We were supposed to make the world
a better place.

1734
02:39:44,845 --> 02:39:46,574
Dan, that's exactly what I am doing.

1735
02:39:46,747 --> 02:39:48,078
Nuclear war?

1736
02:39:48,249 --> 02:39:50,411
Human extinction?

1737
02:40:00,061 --> 02:40:04,964
Of course, my moral safeguards
gave me pause at the necessary sacrifice.

1738
02:40:05,133 --> 02:40:08,102
A few key regions around the globe...

1739
02:40:08,270 --> 02:40:13,731
New York, Los Angeles, Moscow,
Hong Kong.

1740
02:40:13,909 --> 02:40:15,570
Disintegrated in an instant.

1741
02:40:16,311 --> 02:40:19,645
Fifteen million people killed...

1742
02:40:19,816 --> 02:40:21,876
...by Dr. Manhattan himself.

1743
02:40:23,086 --> 02:40:25,884
The world's punishment
for flirting with World War III.

1744
02:40:26,056 --> 02:40:27,182
Jon wouldn't do that.

1745
02:40:27,758 --> 02:40:30,454
A fact no one outside this room
ever has to know.

1746
02:40:31,094 --> 02:40:34,894
The energy breakthrough I was working on
just came to fruition.

1747
02:40:35,499 --> 02:40:39,492
All these years, Jon was helping me
replicate his power...

1748
02:40:39,670 --> 02:40:42,195
...unaware of how I planned to use it.

1749
02:40:42,372 --> 02:40:44,364
You see...

1750
02:40:45,276 --> 02:40:47,676
...the Comedian was right.

1751
02:40:48,379 --> 02:40:53,373
Humanity's savage nature
will inevitably lead to global annihilation.

1752
02:40:53,551 --> 02:40:56,349
So in order to save this planet...

1753
02:40:56,621 --> 02:40:58,680
...I had to trick it...

1754
02:40:59,057 --> 02:41:03,084
...with the greatest practical joke
in human history.

1755
02:41:03,361 --> 02:41:06,762
- Killing millions.
- To save billions.

1756
02:41:07,298 --> 02:41:09,266
A necessary crime.

1757
02:41:09,434 --> 02:41:11,596
You know we can't let you do that.

1758
02:41:13,038 --> 02:41:15,165
"Do that," Rorschach?

1759
02:41:15,341 --> 02:41:16,968
I'm not a comic-book villain.

1760
02:41:17,810 --> 02:41:20,074
Do you think
I'd explain my masterstroke to you...

1761
02:41:20,246 --> 02:41:24,410
...if there were even the slightest possibility
you could affect the outcome?

1762
02:41:27,152 --> 02:41:29,950
I triggered it 35 minutes ago.

1763
02:43:09,426 --> 02:43:12,418
Jesus Christ, Henry.

1764
02:43:12,596 --> 02:43:14,791
Why the hell
didn't we get a launch detection?

1765
02:43:16,700 --> 02:43:21,138
It's not the Soviets, sir.

1766
02:43:21,706 --> 02:43:24,869
Intel indicates the energy signature...

1767
02:43:25,043 --> 02:43:27,478
...was generated by...

1768
02:43:28,447 --> 02:43:30,881
...Dr. Manhattan.

1769
02:43:33,719 --> 02:43:35,277
Jon.

1770
02:43:38,290 --> 02:43:39,416
Interference.

1771
02:43:40,026 --> 02:43:41,926
Cataclysmic interference.

1772
02:43:51,637 --> 02:43:54,402
I can't believe it happened.

1773
02:43:55,409 --> 02:43:58,901
This wasn't caused by nuclear warheads.

1774
02:44:02,983 --> 02:44:04,280
It was me.

1775
02:44:06,319 --> 02:44:07,911
I...

1776
02:44:08,488 --> 02:44:09,512
...did this.

1777
02:44:10,157 --> 02:44:13,615
- What do you mean, you did this?
- Not directly.

1778
02:44:14,594 --> 02:44:17,291
It was made to look like I did it.

1779
02:44:20,335 --> 02:44:21,768
Adrian.

1780
02:44:28,043 --> 02:44:30,034
Speak of the devil.

1781
02:44:33,182 --> 02:44:34,206
Jon...
I know.

1782
02:44:34,383 --> 02:44:36,544
Must stop him.
Killed Blake, killed millions.

1783
02:44:36,718 --> 02:44:38,049
Wait here.

1784
02:44:49,199 --> 02:44:51,565
Adrian, stop this.

1785
02:44:53,036 --> 02:44:54,901
The tachyons were clever...

1786
02:44:56,039 --> 02:45:00,373
...but even if I can't predict where you are,
I can turn the walls to glass.

1787
02:45:01,711 --> 02:45:04,179
I should thank you.

1788
02:45:05,348 --> 02:45:08,545
I'd almost forgotten the excitement
of not knowing...

1789
02:45:09,552 --> 02:45:12,544
<i>... the delights of uncertainty.</i>

1790
02:45:16,727 --> 02:45:18,388
Forgive me, girl.

1791
02:45:41,353 --> 02:45:43,048
You're such an asshole.

1792
02:46:16,989 --> 02:46:18,923
Veidt, you bastard.

1793
02:46:19,091 --> 02:46:21,560
- If you've hurt her, I'll...
- Dan...

1794
02:46:23,297 --> 02:46:27,893
...grow up. My new world
demands less obvious heroism.

1795
02:46:28,068 --> 02:46:30,059
Your...

1796
02:46:30,237 --> 02:46:35,198
...schoolboy heroics are redundant.
What have they achieved?

1797
02:46:36,811 --> 02:46:39,679
Failing to prevent Earth's salvation...

1798
02:46:40,649 --> 02:46:43,049
...is your only triumph.

1799
02:46:43,252 --> 02:46:45,152
I'm disappointed in you, Adrian.

1800
02:46:45,955 --> 02:46:49,447
I'm very disappointed.

1801
02:47:01,838 --> 02:47:05,001
Reassembling myself
was the first trick I learned.

1802
02:47:05,675 --> 02:47:08,075
It didn't kill Osterman.

1803
02:47:10,680 --> 02:47:13,046
Did you really think it would kill me?

1804
02:47:14,351 --> 02:47:17,514
I have walked across the surface
of the sun.

1805
02:47:18,021 --> 02:47:21,184
I have witnessed events
so tiny and so fast...

1806
02:47:21,358 --> 02:47:24,418
...they can hardly be said
to have occurred at all...

1807
02:47:24,594 --> 02:47:28,224
...but you, Adrian, you're just a man.

1808
02:47:29,367 --> 02:47:31,858
The world's smartest man...

1809
02:47:32,169 --> 02:47:34,603
...poses no more threat to me...

1810
02:47:34,772 --> 02:47:37,900
...than does its smartest termite.

1811
02:47:40,177 --> 02:47:41,644
What's that?

1812
02:47:42,046 --> 02:47:43,911
Another ultimate weapon?

1813
02:47:44,548 --> 02:47:46,277
Yes.

1814
02:47:47,885 --> 02:47:49,352
You could say that.

1815
02:47:52,890 --> 02:47:54,825
<i>Came under attack.</i>

1816
02:47:55,661 --> 02:47:58,994
<i>Millions of lives were suddenly ended...</i>

1817
02:47:59,331 --> 02:48:04,530
<i>... in an act of evil
perpetrated by Dr. Manhattan himself.</i>

1818
02:48:06,338 --> 02:48:10,274
<i>Since the attacks,
I have been in constant contact...</i>

1819
02:48:10,442 --> 02:48:13,434
<i>... with the premier of the U.S.S.R.</i>

1820
02:48:13,845 --> 02:48:16,678
<i>Putting aside our past differences...</i>

1821
02:48:17,015 --> 02:48:19,176
<i>... we have both pledged to unite...</i>

1822
02:48:19,518 --> 02:48:22,852
<i>... against this common enemy.</i>

1823
02:48:23,356 --> 02:48:25,347
<i>With the rest of the world...</i>

1824
02:48:25,792 --> 02:48:27,817
<i>... we will prevail.</i>

1825
02:48:30,363 --> 02:48:33,355
<i>This is a day we shall never forget.</i>

1826
02:48:33,533 --> 02:48:37,731
<i>And yet we go forward
to defend the human race...</i>

1827
02:48:37,904 --> 02:48:42,534
<i>... and all that is good
and just in our world.</i>

1828
02:48:43,876 --> 02:48:48,108
<i>Thank you. God bless us all.</i>

1829
02:48:48,481 --> 02:48:50,279
Do you see?

1830
02:48:52,486 --> 02:48:54,954
Two superpowers retreating from war.

1831
02:48:56,557 --> 02:48:58,991
I've saved the earth from hell.

1832
02:48:59,159 --> 02:49:01,127
We both have.

1833
02:49:01,595 --> 02:49:03,791
This is as much your victory as it is mine.

1834
02:49:08,603 --> 02:49:10,093
Now we can return...

1835
02:49:11,539 --> 02:49:13,097
...do what we were meant to.

1836
02:49:13,274 --> 02:49:16,244
We were meant to exact justice.

1837
02:49:16,579 --> 02:49:19,912
- Everyone's gonna know what you've done.
- Will they?

1838
02:49:20,083 --> 02:49:24,884
By exposing me, you would sacrifice
the peace so many died for today.

1839
02:49:25,055 --> 02:49:28,491
- Peace based on a lie.
- But peace...

1840
02:49:28,658 --> 02:49:30,853
...nonetheless.
- He's right.

1841
02:49:31,428 --> 02:49:35,387
Exposing Adrian would only doom the world
to nuclear destruction again.

1842
02:49:35,565 --> 02:49:38,432
No. We can't do this.

1843
02:49:38,602 --> 02:49:40,365
On Mars...

1844
02:49:41,872 --> 02:49:43,704
...you taught me the value of life.

1845
02:49:44,675 --> 02:49:47,109
If we hope to preserve it here...

1846
02:49:47,912 --> 02:49:49,937
...we must remain silent.

1847
02:49:53,785 --> 02:49:55,719
Keep your own secrets.

1848
02:50:02,593 --> 02:50:03,787
Don't even think about it.

1849
02:50:06,397 --> 02:50:08,126
Rorschach.

1850
02:50:09,902 --> 02:50:11,426
Wait.

1851
02:50:12,471 --> 02:50:14,564
Never compromise.

1852
02:50:14,940 --> 02:50:17,807
Not even in the face of armageddon.

1853
02:50:18,210 --> 02:50:21,202
That's always been the difference
between us, Daniel.

1854
02:50:32,257 --> 02:50:35,784
I've made myself feel every death...

1855
02:50:37,263 --> 02:50:43,168
...see every innocent face
I've murdered to save humanity.

1856
02:50:48,741 --> 02:50:52,438
- You understand, don't you?
Without condoning...

1857
02:50:54,113 --> 02:50:56,013
...or condemning...

1858
02:51:00,420 --> 02:51:02,354
...I understand.

1859
02:51:09,763 --> 02:51:12,891
Out of my way. People have to be told.

1860
02:51:13,767 --> 02:51:15,701
You know I can't let you do that.

1861
02:51:16,937 --> 02:51:19,929
Suddenly you discover humanity?

1862
02:51:21,375 --> 02:51:23,206
Convenient.

1863
02:51:31,921 --> 02:51:36,483
If you'd cared from the start,
none of this would have happened.

1864
02:51:40,263 --> 02:51:43,232
I can change almost anything...

1865
02:51:47,803 --> 02:51:50,135
...but I can't change human nature.

1866
02:51:51,474 --> 02:51:54,875
Of course
you must protect Veidt's new utopia.

1867
02:51:56,145 --> 02:51:59,479
What's one more body
amongst foundations?

1868
02:52:05,656 --> 02:52:07,521
Well, what are you waiting for?

1869
02:52:10,994 --> 02:52:12,825
Do it.

1870
02:52:18,936 --> 02:52:19,961
Do it!

1871
02:52:22,674 --> 02:52:26,042
No!

1872
02:52:43,529 --> 02:52:49,297
<i>I'm leaving this galaxy
for one a little less complicated.</i>

1873
02:52:49,468 --> 02:52:51,960
<i>I thought you said you cared
about life again.</i>

1874
02:52:52,138 --> 02:52:53,537
<i>I do.</i>

1875
02:52:54,874 --> 02:52:57,775
I think maybe I'll create some.

1876
02:53:01,881 --> 02:53:04,213
Goodbye, Laurie.

1877
02:53:39,453 --> 02:53:40,613
Come on.

1878
02:53:43,090 --> 02:53:44,683
Come on!

1879
02:53:49,098 --> 02:53:50,429
Dan...

1880
02:53:50,900 --> 02:53:53,664
...a world united and at peace.

1881
02:53:54,537 --> 02:53:55,731
There had to be sacrifice.

1882
02:53:55,905 --> 02:54:00,274
No! You haven't idealized mankind,
you've deformed it.

1883
02:54:00,443 --> 02:54:02,206
You've mutilated it.

1884
02:54:02,578 --> 02:54:04,739
That's your legacy.

1885
02:54:13,290 --> 02:54:16,088
That's the real practical joke.

1886
02:55:08,681 --> 02:55:12,674
<i>We repeat, there is
nothing wrong with your television set.</i>

1887
02:55:12,852 --> 02:55:16,310
<i>You are about to participate
in a great adventure.</i>

1888
02:55:16,489 --> 02:55:19,653
<i>You are about to experience
the awe and mystery...</i>

1889
02:55:19,826 --> 02:55:25,628
<i>... which reaches from the inner mind
to the outer limits.</i>

1890
02:55:26,833 --> 02:55:29,028
Sure you don't want a drink?

1891
02:55:30,036 --> 02:55:31,060
I'm okay.

1892
02:55:32,139 --> 02:55:33,368
Cheers.

1893
02:55:34,809 --> 02:55:37,937
There's something I need
to get off my chest.

1894
02:55:39,213 --> 02:55:41,704
I know that Eddie Blake was my father.

1895
02:55:44,719 --> 02:55:46,482
Laurel.

1896
02:55:47,488 --> 02:55:49,820
What you must think of me.

1897
02:55:50,658 --> 02:55:53,183
I'm sorry I never told you.

1898
02:55:53,361 --> 02:55:55,158
I should have...

1899
02:55:55,329 --> 02:55:59,460
...but I don't know, I just felt ashamed.
I felt stupid.

1900
02:55:59,635 --> 02:56:01,569
It doesn't matter.

1901
02:56:02,404 --> 02:56:07,671
People's lives take them strange places.
They do strange things...

1902
02:56:08,243 --> 02:56:11,178
...and, well,
sometimes they can't talk about them.

1903
02:56:11,346 --> 02:56:13,679
I know how that is...

1904
02:56:14,417 --> 02:56:17,011
...but I just want you to know...

1905
02:56:17,587 --> 02:56:20,420
...that you never did anything wrong
by me.

1906
02:56:24,594 --> 02:56:28,861
You asked me why I wasn't mad at him.

1907
02:56:30,434 --> 02:56:32,925
Because he gave me you.

1908
02:56:37,942 --> 02:56:39,034
Thanks, Mom.

1909
02:56:41,779 --> 02:56:43,576
I love you.

1910
02:56:51,121 --> 02:56:55,320
- Hello, Miss Jupiter.
- Oh, Sally, please.

1911
02:56:56,962 --> 02:57:01,558
Excuse me. Gotta go freshen up.
I'll be right back.

1912
02:57:12,077 --> 02:57:16,241
- So how's it going up here?
- Good. How's it going down there?

1913
02:57:16,414 --> 02:57:19,907
Good. I think I've got everything working.

1914
02:57:20,086 --> 02:57:24,716
All of Archie's systems are upgraded.
Finished the tinkering for now...

1915
02:57:24,891 --> 02:57:27,121
...so all we gotta do is take her out.

1916
02:57:27,293 --> 02:57:30,353
Well, that sounds like a date.

1917
02:57:41,674 --> 02:57:43,938
Are we gonna be all right?

1918
02:57:46,012 --> 02:57:50,313
Long as people think Jon's
still watching us, we'll be all right...

1919
02:57:50,517 --> 02:57:52,382
...in the end.

1920
02:57:54,021 --> 02:57:56,182
I know what Jon would say:

1921
02:57:56,356 --> 02:57:58,381
Nothing ends.

1922
02:58:00,294 --> 02:58:02,888
Nothing ever ends.

1923
02:58:50,247 --> 02:58:54,013
Seymour, we got nothing
to write about anymore.

1924
02:58:54,185 --> 02:58:55,550
Everyone in the country...

1925
02:58:55,720 --> 02:58:57,984
...every country in the world
are holding hands...

1926
02:58:58,155 --> 02:59:01,420
...and singing songs
about peace and love.

1927
02:59:01,926 --> 02:59:04,793
It's like living in a goddamn
global hippie commune.

1928
02:59:04,962 --> 02:59:08,899
Well, Ronald Reagan says he's gonna
be running for president in '88.

1929
02:59:09,067 --> 02:59:10,898
We could run a piece on that.

1930
02:59:11,069 --> 02:59:14,232
Seymour, we don't dignify absurdities
with coverage.

1931
02:59:14,406 --> 02:59:18,240
This is still America, damn it.
Who wants a cowboy in the White House?

1932
02:59:18,977 --> 02:59:23,209
Okay. I could look for something
in the crank file.

1933
02:59:23,382 --> 02:59:24,974
Crank file.

1934
02:59:25,150 --> 02:59:27,141
Whatever. Take some initiative.

1935
02:59:27,319 --> 02:59:29,947
Run whatever you like.
I leave it entirely in your hands.

1936
02:59:36,462 --> 02:59:41,161
<i>Rorschach's journal, October 12th, 1955.</i>

1937
02:59:41,334 --> 02:59:45,794
<i>Tonight, a comedian died in New York.</i>
