1
00:00:17,798 --> 00:00:20,130
<i>Did you know there are more people</i>
<i>with genius lQs living in China</i>

2
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:22,258
<i>than there are people of any kind</i>
<i>living in the United States?</i>

3
00:00:22,336 --> 00:00:24,133
<i>- That can't possibly be true.</i>
<i>- lt is.</i>

4
00:00:24,237 --> 00:00:25,261
<i>What would account for that?</i>

5
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:28,331
Well, first, an awful lot of people
live in China, but here's my question.

6
00:00:28,442 --> 00:00:30,569
How do you distinguish yourself
in a population of people

7
00:00:30,644 --> 00:00:32,475
who all got 1600 on their SATs?

8
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,342
- l didn't know they take SATs in China.
- They don't.

9
00:00:34,448 --> 00:00:36,575
l wasn't talking about China anymore,
l was talking about me.

10
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,117
You got a 1600?

11
00:00:38,185 --> 00:00:40,016
Yes. l could sing in an a cappella group,
but l can't sing.

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,314
Does that mean you actually
got nothing wrong?

13
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:43,685
l could row crew or invent a $25 PC.

14
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,018
Or you could get into a final club.

15
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,456
Or l get into a final club.

16
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,954
You know, from a woman's perspective,

17
00:00:48,028 --> 00:00:49,928
sometimes not singing in
an a cappella group is a good thing.

18
00:00:49,996 --> 00:00:51,020
This is serious.

19
00:00:51,131 --> 00:00:52,598
On the other hand,
l do like guys who row crew.

20
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,531
Well, l can't do that.

21
00:00:54,835 --> 00:00:56,200
l was kidding.

22
00:00:56,303 --> 00:00:57,463
And, yes, l got nothing wrong on the test.

23
00:00:57,537 --> 00:00:59,334
- Have you ever tried?
- l'm trying right now.

24
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:01,270
- To row crew?
- To get into a final club.

25
00:01:01,341 --> 00:01:03,605
To row crew? No.
Are you, like, whatever, delusional?

26
00:01:03,677 --> 00:01:05,645
Maybe it's just sometimes
you say two things at once.

27
00:01:05,712 --> 00:01:07,270
l'm not sure which one
l'm supposed to be aiming at.

28
00:01:07,347 --> 00:01:09,281
But you've seen guys who row crew, right?

29
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:10,373
No.

30
00:01:10,484 --> 00:01:12,543
Okay, well, they're bigger than me.
They're world-class athletes.

31
00:01:12,652 --> 00:01:14,119
And a second ago,
you said you like guys who row crew

32
00:01:14,187 --> 00:01:15,211
so l assumed you had met one.

33
00:01:15,322 --> 00:01:19,315
l guess l just meant l like the idea of it.
You know, the way a girl likes cowboys.

34
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,884
Okay.

35
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:22,453
Should we get something to eat?

36
00:01:22,529 --> 00:01:24,326
Would you like to talk
about something else?

37
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:27,828
No. lt's just since the beginning of
the conversation about finals club,

38
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:29,801
l think l may have missed a birthday.

39
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,733
There are really more people in China with
genius lQs than the entire population...

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,139
The Phoenix is the most diverse.
The Fly Club... Roosevelt punched the Porc.

41
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,302
Which one?

42
00:01:38,378 --> 00:01:39,868
The Porcellian, the Porc.
lt's the best of the best.

43
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,709
- Which Roosevelt?
- Theodore.

44
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,141
ls it true that they send a bus around
to pick up girls

45
00:01:45,218 --> 00:01:46,685
who want to party with
the next Fed chairman?

46
00:01:46,753 --> 00:01:49,483
So you can see why
it's so important to get in.

47
00:01:49,556 --> 00:01:51,080
Okay, well, which is the easiest to get into?

48
00:01:53,593 --> 00:01:56,494
- Why would you ask me that?
- l was just asking.

49
00:01:56,563 --> 00:01:58,724
None of them. That's the point.

50
00:01:58,832 --> 00:02:01,733
My friend Eduardo made $300,000
betting oil futures one summer

51
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:03,166
and Eduardo won't come close to getting in.

52
00:02:03,236 --> 00:02:05,204
The ability to make money doesn't
impress anybody around here.

53
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:08,537
Must be nice.
He made $300,000 in a summer?

54
00:02:08,608 --> 00:02:10,940
- He likes meteorology.
- You said it was oil futures.

55
00:02:11,044 --> 00:02:13,239
You can read the weather,
you can predict the price of heating oil.

56
00:02:13,346 --> 00:02:14,404
l think you asked me that

57
00:02:14,514 --> 00:02:16,277
because you think
the final club that's easiest to get into

58
00:02:16,383 --> 00:02:17,611
is the one where l'll have the best chance.

59
00:02:17,717 --> 00:02:20,049
l... What?

60
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,678
You asked me which one was
the easiest to get into

61
00:02:21,755 --> 00:02:24,246
because you think that that's the one
where l'll have the best chance.

62
00:02:24,357 --> 00:02:26,848
The one that's the easiest to get into
would be the one

63
00:02:26,927 --> 00:02:28,087
where anybody has the best chance.

64
00:02:28,195 --> 00:02:29,753
You didn't ask me which one
was the best one,

65
00:02:29,863 --> 00:02:31,296
you asked me which one
was the easiest one.

66
00:02:31,565 --> 00:02:34,966
l was honestly just asking, okay?
l was just asking to ask.

67
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:37,434
- Mark, l'm not speaking in code.
- Erica.

68
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:39,871
You're obsessed with finals clubs.

69
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,306
You have finals clubs OCD
and you need to see someone about it

70
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:44,070
who will prescribe you
some sort of medication.

71
00:02:44,144 --> 00:02:46,669
You don't care if the side effects
may include blindness.

72
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,442
Final clubs. Not "finals clubs.''

73
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,275
And there's a difference between
being obsessed and being motivated.

74
00:02:53,353 --> 00:02:56,151
Yes. There is.

75
00:02:56,256 --> 00:02:57,951
Well, you do.
That was cryptic, so you do speak in code.

76
00:02:58,024 --> 00:02:59,252
l didn't mean to be cryptic.

77
00:02:59,326 --> 00:03:01,123
l'm just saying l need to do
something substantial

78
00:03:01,194 --> 00:03:02,991
in order to get the attention of the clubs.

79
00:03:03,096 --> 00:03:04,859
- Why?
- Because they're exclusive.

80
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,362
And fun, and they lead to a better life.

81
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:08,991
Teddy Roosevelt didn't get elected president

82
00:03:09,102 --> 00:03:11,036
because he was a member
of the Phoenix Club.

83
00:03:11,137 --> 00:03:13,367
He was a member of the Porcellian,
and yes, he did.

84
00:03:13,473 --> 00:03:16,806
Well, why don't you just concentrate
on being the best you you can be?

85
00:03:17,444 --> 00:03:18,468
Did you really just say that?

86
00:03:18,545 --> 00:03:20,012
l was kidding.

87
00:03:20,113 --> 00:03:21,808
Just because something's trite
doesn't make it less true.

88
00:03:21,882 --> 00:03:22,940
l wanna try to be straightforward with you

89
00:03:23,016 --> 00:03:25,280
and tell you l think you might
want to be a little more supportive.

90
00:03:25,352 --> 00:03:28,981
lf l get in, l will be taking you
to the events and the gatherings,

91
00:03:29,055 --> 00:03:32,218
and you'll be meeting a lot of people
you wouldn't normally get to meet.

92
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,793
You would do that for me?

93
00:03:35,462 --> 00:03:36,827
We're dating.

94
00:03:37,063 --> 00:03:38,291
Okay.

95
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,558
Well, l wanna try and be
straightforward with you

96
00:03:41,668 --> 00:03:43,465
and let you know that we're not anymore.

97
00:03:43,537 --> 00:03:46,062
- What do you mean?
- We're not dating anymore. l'm sorry.

98
00:03:46,172 --> 00:03:48,197
- ls this a joke?
- No, it's not.

99
00:03:48,308 --> 00:03:49,332
You're breaking up with me?

100
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:50,671
You're gonna introduce me to people

101
00:03:50,744 --> 00:03:52,405
l wouldn't normally
have the chance to meet?

102
00:03:52,512 --> 00:03:54,309
What the... What is that supposed to mean?

103
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:55,643
- Wait, settle down.
- What is it supposed to mean?

104
00:03:55,715 --> 00:03:57,580
Erica, the reason we're able to sit here
and drink right now

105
00:03:57,684 --> 00:03:59,413
is 'cause you used to sleep
with the door guy.

106
00:04:00,487 --> 00:04:04,184
"The door guy"? His name is Bobby.
l have not slept with the door guy.

107
00:04:04,257 --> 00:04:08,660
The door guy is a friend of mine,
and he's a perfectly good class of people.

108
00:04:08,728 --> 00:04:11,253
And what part of Long lsland
are you from, Wimbledon?

109
00:04:11,364 --> 00:04:13,594
- Wait. Wait, wait.
- l'm going back to my dorm.

110
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,031
- ls this real?
- Yes.

111
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:17,092
- Then wait, l apologize, okay?
- l have to go study.

112
00:04:17,203 --> 00:04:18,534
- Erica?
- Yes?

113
00:04:18,605 --> 00:04:20,835
- l'm sorry, l mean it.
- l appreciate that, but l have to go study.

114
00:04:20,907 --> 00:04:23,205
Come on, you don't have to study.
Let's just talk.

115
00:04:23,276 --> 00:04:24,538
- l can't.
- Why?

116
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:27,512
Because it is exhausting.
Dating you is like dating a StairMaster.

117
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:29,776
All l meant is that you're not likely to...
Currently...

118
00:04:29,883 --> 00:04:31,043
l wasn't making a comment
on your appearance.

119
00:04:31,117 --> 00:04:33,278
l was saying that you go to BU.
l was stating a fact, that's all,

120
00:04:33,386 --> 00:04:34,410
and if it seemed rude, then l apologize.

121
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:35,852
- l have to go study.
- You don't have to study.

122
00:04:35,922 --> 00:04:37,253
Why do you keep saying
l don't have to study?

123
00:04:37,357 --> 00:04:39,188
'Cause you go to BU.

124
00:04:41,294 --> 00:04:42,727
Do you want to get some food?

125
00:04:43,463 --> 00:04:46,296
l am sorry you are not sufficiently
impressed with my education.

126
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:48,291
And l'm sorry l don't have a rowboat,
so we're even.

127
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:51,131
- l think we should just be friends.
- l don't want friends.

128
00:04:51,237 --> 00:04:52,261
l was just being polite.

129
00:04:52,372 --> 00:04:53,566
l have no intention
of being friends with you.

130
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,733
l'm under some pressure right now
from my OS class

131
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:58,369
and if we could just order some food,
l think we should...

132
00:04:58,745 --> 00:05:03,148
Okay, you are probably going to be
a very successful computer person.

133
00:05:03,717 --> 00:05:06,208
But you're gonna go through life
thinking that girls don't like you

134
00:05:06,286 --> 00:05:07,947
because you're a nerd.

135
00:05:08,722 --> 00:05:11,623
And l want you to know from the bottom
of my heart that that won't be true.

136
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:15,753
lt'll be because you're an asshole.

137
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:19,877
<i>Erica Albright's a bitch.</i>

138
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,504
<i>Do you think that's because her family</i>
<i>changed their name from Albrecht,</i>

139
00:08:22,615 --> 00:08:25,812
<i>or do you think it's because</i>
<i>all BU girls are bitches?</i>

140
00:08:30,156 --> 00:08:32,215
<i>For the record, she may look like a 34C,</i>

141
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:34,987
<i>but she's getting all kinds of help</i>
<i>from our friends at Victoria's Secret.</i>

142
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:38,997
<i>She's a 34B, as in barely anything there.</i>
<i>False advertising.</i>

143
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:44,999
<i>The truth is, she has a nice face.</i>

144
00:08:45,071 --> 00:08:47,369
<i>l need to do something</i>
<i>to take my mind off her.</i>

145
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:50,033
<i>Easy enough, except l need an idea.</i>

146
00:08:56,182 --> 00:08:58,343
<i>l'm a little intoxicated, l'm not gonna lie.</i>

147
00:08:58,418 --> 00:09:00,352
<i>So what if it's not even 10</i>/<i>00 p.m..</i>
<i>and it's a Tuesday night?</i>

148
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,478
Billy.

149
00:09:01,554 --> 00:09:03,317
<i>The Kirkland facebook</i>
<i>is open on my desktop,</i>

150
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:06,051
<i>and some of these people have</i>
<i>pretty horrendous facebook pics.</i>

151
00:09:07,026 --> 00:09:09,722
<i>Billy Olson's sitting here and had</i>
<i>the idea of putting some of the pictures</i>

152
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:13,060
<i>next to pictures of farm animals</i>
<i>and have people vote on who's hotter.</i>

153
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,724
<i>Good call, Mr. Olson.</i>

154
00:09:21,474 --> 00:09:24,068
<i>Yeah, it's on.</i>
<i>l'm not gonna do the farm animals,</i>

155
00:09:24,143 --> 00:09:26,043
<i>but l like the idea of comparing</i>
<i>two people together.</i>

156
00:09:26,112 --> 00:09:27,602
<i>lt gives the whole thing a very "Turing" feel</i>

157
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:29,682
<i>since people's ratings of the pictures</i>
<i>will be more implicit</i>

158
00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:32,274
<i>than, say, choosing a number to</i>
<i>represent each person's hotness,</i>

159
00:09:32,385 --> 00:09:34,080
<i>like they do on hotornot.com.</i>

160
00:09:34,187 --> 00:09:36,712
<i>The first thing we're going to need</i>
<i>is a lot of pictures.</i>

161
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:39,019
<i>Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep</i>
<i>a public centralized facebook,</i>

162
00:09:39,092 --> 00:09:40,116
<i>so l'm going to have to get all the images</i>

163
00:09:40,226 --> 00:09:41,853
<i>from the individual houses</i>
<i>that people are in.</i>

164
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:44,691
<i>Let the hacking begin.</i>

165
00:10:00,747 --> 00:10:01,771
<i>First up is Kirkland.</i>

166
00:10:01,881 --> 00:10:04,873
<i>They keep everything open and allow</i>
<i>indexes in their Apache configuration.</i>

167
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:09,479
<i>So a little Wget magic is all that's necessary</i>
<i>to download the entire Kirkland facebook.</i>

168
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:10,613
<i>Kids' stuff.</i>

169
00:10:28,107 --> 00:10:29,131
<i>Next is Eliot.</i>

170
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:31,335
<i>They're also open,</i>
<i>but with no indexes on Apache.</i>

171
00:10:31,444 --> 00:10:32,468
<i>l can run an empty search</i>

172
00:10:32,578 --> 00:10:34,944
<i>and it returns all of the images</i>
<i>in the database in a single page.</i>

173
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:38,313
<i>And l can save the page and Mozilla</i>
<i>will save all the images for me.</i>

174
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:40,010
<i>Excellent. Moving right along.</i>

175
00:10:40,453 --> 00:10:42,580
Excuse me! Everybody!

176
00:10:42,655 --> 00:10:46,091
You are at one of the oldest,
one of the most exclusive clubs,

177
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,923
not just at Harvard, but in the world.

178
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:50,319
And l want to welcome you all

179
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,831
to Phoenix Club's first party
of the fall semester!

180
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,636
<i>Lowell has some security.</i>
<i>They require a user name/password combo,</i>

181
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,873
<i>and l'm gonna go ahead and say they don't</i>
<i>have access to the main FAS user database,</i>

182
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,140
<i>so they have no way</i>
<i>of detecting an intrusion.</i>

183
00:11:09,349 --> 00:11:13,080
<i>Adams has no security, but limits</i>
<i>the number of results to 20 a page.</i>

184
00:11:13,186 --> 00:11:16,246
<i>All l need to do is break out the same script</i>
<i>l used on Lowell and we're set.</i>

185
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:19,815
<i>Quincy has no online facebook.</i>
<i>What a sham.</i>

186
00:11:20,193 --> 00:11:21,217
<i>Nothing l can do about that.</i>

187
00:11:22,662 --> 00:11:23,720
<i>Dunster is intense.</i>

188
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,526
<i>Not only is there no public directory,</i>
<i>but there's no directory at all.</i>

189
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:27,657
<i>You have to do searches,</i>

190
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:30,328
<i>and if your search returns more</i>
<i>than 20 matches, nothing gets returned.</i>

191
00:11:30,403 --> 00:11:32,667
<i>And once you do get results,</i>
<i>they don't link directly to the images.</i>

192
00:11:32,739 --> 00:11:35,333
<i>They link to a PHP that redirects</i>
<i>or something. Weird.</i>

193
00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:36,875
<i>This may be difficult. l'll come back later.</i>

194
00:11:36,943 --> 00:11:38,740
- Hey, <i>Shark Week's</i> on.
- What?

195
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:41,506
- Great white, beautiful fish.
- Nice.

196
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:43,242
<i>Leverett is a little better.</i>
<i>They still make you search,</i>

197
00:11:43,349 --> 00:11:46,443
<i>but you can do an empty search and get</i>
<i>links to pages with every student's picture.</i>

198
00:11:46,552 --> 00:11:49,214
<i>lt's slightly obnoxious that they</i>
<i>only let you view one picture at a time,</i>

199
00:11:49,288 --> 00:11:52,189
<i>and there's no way l'm going to go</i>
<i>to 500 pages to download pics one at a time.</i>

200
00:11:52,258 --> 00:11:55,625
<i>So it's definitely necessary to break out</i>
<i>Emacs and modify that Perl script.</i>

201
00:12:06,305 --> 00:12:07,772
Here you go.

202
00:12:12,945 --> 00:12:14,071
<i>Done.</i>

203
00:12:14,447 --> 00:12:16,244
Hey, what's going on?

204
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:19,978
<i>Perfect timing. Eduardo's here</i>
<i>and he's going to have the key ingredient.</i>

205
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:21,713
- Hey, Mark.
- Wardo.

206
00:12:21,788 --> 00:12:23,779
You and Erica split up.

207
00:12:23,923 --> 00:12:24,947
How did you know that?

208
00:12:25,058 --> 00:12:26,548
lt's on your blog.

209
00:12:27,593 --> 00:12:29,220
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?

210
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:31,627
- l need you.
- l'm here for you.

211
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:33,765
No, l need the algorithm you use
to rank chess players.

212
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,063
- Are you okay?
- We're ranking girls.

213
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:40,462
- You mean other students.
- Yeah.

214
00:12:40,573 --> 00:12:42,268
You think this is such a good idea?

215
00:12:42,475 --> 00:12:43,840
- l need the algorithm.
- Mark...

216
00:12:43,943 --> 00:12:45,774
l need the algorithm.

217
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,446
Give each girl a base rating of 1400.

218
00:12:49,515 --> 00:12:53,975
At any given time Girl A has a rating R-a
and Girl B has a rating R-b.

219
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,816
When any two girls are matched up,
there's an expectation of which will win

220
00:12:56,923 --> 00:12:58,015
based on their current rating, right?

221
00:12:58,124 --> 00:13:01,582
Yeah. And those expectations
are expressed this way.

222
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:03,091
Let's write it.

223
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,705
One on the left.

224
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:21,510
The right.

225
00:13:21,614 --> 00:13:23,013
Yeah, still the right.

226
00:13:23,116 --> 00:13:24,947
- lt works.
- Who should we send it to first?

227
00:13:25,017 --> 00:13:26,041
- Dwyer.
- Neal.

228
00:13:26,152 --> 00:13:29,212
- Who are you gonna send it to?
- Just a couple of people.

229
00:13:29,355 --> 00:13:30,447
The question is,

230
00:13:30,723 --> 00:13:33,123
who are they gonna send it to?

231
00:14:02,155 --> 00:14:03,554
Hey, guys, check this out.

232
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:07,723
Someone go to the left. Dude, do left.

233
00:14:07,827 --> 00:14:10,352
Look at these girls. Right or left?

234
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:12,693
- Left is hot.
- Left? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

235
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:15,491
Right or left?

236
00:14:15,568 --> 00:14:17,365
That's my roommate.

237
00:14:17,436 --> 00:14:19,370
- Oh, my God.
- The girl on the left.

238
00:14:20,873 --> 00:14:22,431
This is pathetic.

239
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:23,566
Right.

240
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:24,870
Left.

241
00:14:25,444 --> 00:14:26,502
- Left.
- Left?

242
00:14:27,613 --> 00:14:28,944
Oh, shit.

243
00:14:29,782 --> 00:14:31,113
Albright.

244
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:33,579
He blogged about you.

245
00:14:34,253 --> 00:14:35,948
You don't wanna read it.

246
00:14:39,926 --> 00:14:41,086
Left.

247
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:42,687
Latina.

248
00:14:42,762 --> 00:14:43,956
Erica.

249
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:46,288
ls this yours?

250
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,866
l stole it from a tranny.

251
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:49,959
Get the hell out of here!

252
00:14:50,636 --> 00:14:52,627
- Left.
- One on the right.

253
00:14:52,738 --> 00:14:54,205
Left.

254
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,374
Man, that's an awful lot of traffic.

255
00:15:04,317 --> 00:15:07,809
You think maybe we shouldn't shut it down
before we get into trouble?

256
00:15:16,662 --> 00:15:17,856
Hello?

257
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:21,997
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What?

258
00:15:22,935 --> 00:15:23,959
At 4:00 in the morning?

259
00:15:24,036 --> 00:15:27,164
Well, there's a very unusual amount
of traffic to the switch at Kirkland.

260
00:15:27,473 --> 00:15:29,703
You're saying it's unusual
for 4:00 in the morning?

261
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:32,869
No, this'd be unusual
for halftime at the Super Bowl.

262
00:15:33,546 --> 00:15:34,945
All right.

263
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,208
l gotta go in.

264
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:41,346
What's going on?

265
00:15:41,454 --> 00:15:44,048
Harvard's network is about to crash.

266
00:15:50,229 --> 00:15:51,355
You don't think...

267
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:54,659
l do.

268
00:15:55,401 --> 00:15:57,562
Go see if it's everybody's.

269
00:16:03,142 --> 00:16:04,507
l can't connect.

270
00:16:05,678 --> 00:16:07,475
The network's down.

271
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:10,210
Unless it's a coincidence, l think this is us.

272
00:16:10,316 --> 00:16:11,749
lt's not a coincidence.

273
00:16:12,184 --> 00:16:13,708
Holy shit.

274
00:16:18,024 --> 00:16:19,548
So you were called in front of the Ad Board.

275
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:21,320
That's not what happened.

276
00:16:21,394 --> 00:16:23,021
You weren't called in front
of the Administrative Board?

277
00:16:23,095 --> 00:16:26,861
No, back. l mean back at the bar
with Erica Albright. She said all that?

278
00:16:26,932 --> 00:16:28,559
- Mark...
- That l said that stuff to her?

279
00:16:28,668 --> 00:16:30,329
l was reading from the transcript
of her deposition.

280
00:16:30,403 --> 00:16:32,064
Yeah, why would you even need
to depose her?

281
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:33,832
That's really for us to decide.

282
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:37,433
You think if l know she can make me
look like a jerk, l'll be more likely to settle.

283
00:16:37,543 --> 00:16:38,942
Why don't we stretch our legs for a minute?

284
00:16:39,045 --> 00:16:40,774
Can we do that?
lt's been almost three hours.

285
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,543
And frankly, you did spend an awful lot
of time embarrassing Mr. Zuckerberg

286
00:16:44,617 --> 00:16:46,448
with the girl's testimony from the bar.

287
00:16:46,552 --> 00:16:48,179
l'm not embarrassed,
she just made a lot of that up.

288
00:16:48,254 --> 00:16:49,346
She was under oath.

289
00:16:49,422 --> 00:16:51,788
Then l guess that would be the first time
somebody's lied under oath.

290
00:17:02,635 --> 00:17:05,604
The site got 2,200 hits within two hours?

291
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:07,062
Thousand.

292
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:08,299
What?

293
00:17:09,442 --> 00:17:11,273
Twenty-two thousand.

294
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:14,705
Wow.

295
00:17:31,597 --> 00:17:33,963
These guys are just freakin' fast.

296
00:17:39,305 --> 00:17:42,103
ls there any way to make this a fair fight?

297
00:17:42,174 --> 00:17:43,937
Jump out and swim.

298
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,571
l think we'd have to jump out and drown.

299
00:17:46,645 --> 00:17:49,671
Well, you could row forward
and l could row backward.

300
00:17:49,782 --> 00:17:53,013
We're genetically identical.
Science says we'd stay in one place.

301
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,177
Just row the damn boat.

302
00:18:02,194 --> 00:18:04,025
- You guys hear about this?
- What?

303
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,759
Two nights ago, a sophomore choked
the network from a laptop at Kirkland.

304
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,323
- Really?
- At 4:00 a.m.

305
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:10,927
How?

306
00:18:11,003 --> 00:18:14,029
He set up a website where you vote
on the hotness of female undergrads.

307
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,973
What were we doing
that none of us heard about this?

308
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,099
l don't know.

309
00:18:17,176 --> 00:18:19,701
A three-hour low-rate
technical row before breakfast.

310
00:18:19,812 --> 00:18:21,279
Full course load. Studying.

311
00:18:21,347 --> 00:18:23,645
Another three hours in the tank
and then studying.

312
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:24,944
l'm not sure how we missed it.

313
00:18:25,017 --> 00:18:26,644
How much activity was there on this thing?

314
00:18:26,786 --> 00:18:28,515
Twenty-two thousand page requests.

315
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:30,446
Twenty-two thousand?

316
00:18:30,523 --> 00:18:32,991
Cam, this guy hacked
the facebook of seven houses.

317
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:35,720
He set up the whole website in one night,
and he did it while he was drunk.

318
00:18:35,828 --> 00:18:36,988
Twenty-two thousand?

319
00:18:37,563 --> 00:18:40,498
- Well, how do you know he was drunk?
- He was blogging simultaneously.

320
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:44,229
- You know what l think?
- Way ahead of you.

321
00:18:44,336 --> 00:18:45,997
This is our guy.

322
00:18:46,705 --> 00:18:48,002
Cameron Winklevoss.

323
00:18:48,073 --> 00:18:51,304
W-l-N-K-L-E-V-O-S-S.

324
00:18:51,377 --> 00:18:52,674
"Cameron" spelled the usual way.

325
00:18:52,745 --> 00:18:54,337
Tyler Winklevoss.

326
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:57,746
Tyler spelled the usual way, and my
last name is the same as my brother's.

327
00:18:57,917 --> 00:19:01,546
Mr. Zuckerberg, this is
an Administrative Board hearing.

328
00:19:01,987 --> 00:19:04,854
You're being accused
of intentionally breaching security,

329
00:19:04,924 --> 00:19:06,357
violating copyrights,

330
00:19:06,425 --> 00:19:11,727
violating individual privacy
by creating the website www.facemash.com.

331
00:19:12,064 --> 00:19:14,589
You're also charged with
being in violation of university policy,

332
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,895
on distribution of digitized images.

333
00:19:17,002 --> 00:19:20,028
Before we begin with our questioning,
you're allowed to make a statement.

334
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:21,333
Would you like to do so?

335
00:19:22,241 --> 00:19:23,367
l...

336
00:19:24,443 --> 00:19:29,073
You know, l've already apologized
in <i>The Crimson</i> to the ABHW,

337
00:19:29,148 --> 00:19:30,740
to Fuerza Latina,

338
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:33,148
and to any women at Harvard
who may have been insulted,

339
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:35,482
as l take it that they were.

340
00:19:36,222 --> 00:19:38,452
As for any charges stemming
from the breach of security,

341
00:19:38,557 --> 00:19:41,424
l believe l deserve
some recognition from this board.

342
00:19:43,896 --> 00:19:45,557
- l'm sorry?
- Yes.

343
00:19:46,432 --> 00:19:47,626
l don't understand.

344
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:48,757
Which part?

345
00:19:49,268 --> 00:19:50,929
You deserve recognition?

346
00:19:51,504 --> 00:19:54,132
l believe l've pointed out
some pretty gaping holes in your system.

347
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,231
- Excuse me, may l?
- Yes.

348
00:19:57,309 --> 00:19:58,742
Mr. Zuckerberg,

349
00:19:58,811 --> 00:20:02,008
l'm in charge of security
for all computers on the Harvard network,

350
00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:04,514
and l can assure you of its sophistication.

351
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:08,178
ln fact, it was that level of sophistication
that led us to you in less than four hours.

352
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:09,918
- Four hours?
- Yes, sir.

353
00:20:09,989 --> 00:20:11,013
That would be impressive,

354
00:20:11,123 --> 00:20:12,454
except if you had known
what you were looking for,

355
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:14,322
you would have seen it
written on my dorm room window.

356
00:20:20,032 --> 00:20:21,090
So?

357
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,498
Six months academic probation.

358
00:20:23,702 --> 00:20:25,829
Wow. Well, they had to make
an example out of you.

359
00:20:25,938 --> 00:20:27,496
They had my blog.

360
00:20:27,606 --> 00:20:29,369
l shouldn't have written
that thing about the farm animals.

361
00:20:29,475 --> 00:20:30,772
That was stupid.

362
00:20:30,843 --> 00:20:33,937
But l was kidding, for God's sakes.
Doesn't anybody have a sense of humor?

363
00:20:34,013 --> 00:20:36,447
- l tried to stop you.
- l know.

364
00:20:36,515 --> 00:20:40,042
How do you do this thing where
you manage to get all girls to hate us?

365
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:42,052
- And why do l let you?
- l know.

366
00:20:42,154 --> 00:20:44,645
- You can't do that.
- Wardo, l said l know.

367
00:20:44,723 --> 00:20:46,816
Okay, let's look at a sample problem.

368
00:20:46,892 --> 00:20:50,293
Suppose we're given a computer
with a 16-bit virtual address

369
00:20:50,362 --> 00:20:52,660
and a page size of 256 bytes.

370
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:57,969
The system uses one-level page tables
that start at address hex 400.

371
00:20:58,504 --> 00:21:01,667
Maybe you want DMA on your 16-bit system.
Who knows?

372
00:21:02,207 --> 00:21:05,438
The first few pages are reserved
for hardware flags, etc.

373
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:08,378
Assume page-table entries have
eight status bits.

374
00:21:08,914 --> 00:21:11,314
The eight status bits would then be...

375
00:21:11,383 --> 00:21:12,680
Anybody?

376
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,387
And l see we have our first surrender.

377
00:21:16,488 --> 00:21:17,750
Don't worry, Mr. Zuckerberg.

378
00:21:17,856 --> 00:21:20,051
Brighter men than you
have tried and failed this class.

379
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,926
One valid bit, one modified bit,
one reference bit and five permission bits.

380
00:21:26,932 --> 00:21:28,263
That is correct.

381
00:21:29,034 --> 00:21:31,229
Does everybody see how he got there?

382
00:21:36,942 --> 00:21:38,068
Mark?

383
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:41,105
- You Mark Zuckerberg?
- Yeah.

384
00:21:41,513 --> 00:21:43,413
- Cameron Winklevoss.
- Hi.

385
00:21:43,515 --> 00:21:44,539
Tyler Winklevoss.

386
00:21:44,617 --> 00:21:46,016
Are you guys related?

387
00:21:46,085 --> 00:21:47,575
- That's good.
- Funny.

388
00:21:47,686 --> 00:21:49,119
We never heard that before.

389
00:21:49,622 --> 00:21:51,522
So, what can l do for you?
Did l insult your girlfriends?

390
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,683
No. You didn't. Actually, l don't know.

391
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:55,454
- Yeah, we never asked.
- We should do that.

392
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:56,585
No.

393
00:21:56,695 --> 00:21:58,629
We have an idea
we want to talk to you about.

394
00:21:59,965 --> 00:22:01,023
You got a minute?

395
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,126
You guys look like
you spend some time at the gym.

396
00:22:04,236 --> 00:22:05,760
- We have to.
- Why?

397
00:22:05,871 --> 00:22:07,270
We row crew.

398
00:22:08,641 --> 00:22:10,199
- Yeah, l've got a minute.
- Great.

399
00:22:15,214 --> 00:22:17,205
- So, you ever been inside the Porcellian?
- No.

400
00:22:17,282 --> 00:22:18,909
You understand we can't take you
past the bike room,

401
00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:20,076
because you're not a member.

402
00:22:20,152 --> 00:22:21,585
l've heard.

403
00:22:24,323 --> 00:22:27,315
- You want a sandwich or something?
- Okay.

404
00:22:27,426 --> 00:22:29,087
- Mark, right?
- Yeah.

405
00:22:29,161 --> 00:22:31,152
- Mark, this is Divya Narendra, our partner.
- Hi.

406
00:22:31,263 --> 00:22:33,094
We were really impressed with Facemash.

407
00:22:33,165 --> 00:22:35,759
When we checked you out,
you also built CourseMatch.

408
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:36,892
l don't know CourseMatch.

409
00:22:36,969 --> 00:22:39,403
You go online and see
what courses your friends are taking.

410
00:22:39,471 --> 00:22:41,098
lt's really smart, man.

411
00:22:43,275 --> 00:22:44,333
- Mark.
- Yeah.

412
00:22:44,443 --> 00:22:46,240
We were talking about CourseMatch.

413
00:22:47,913 --> 00:22:49,278
lt was kind of a no-brainer.

414
00:22:49,348 --> 00:22:51,316
But you invented something
in high school, too, right?

415
00:22:51,817 --> 00:22:54,809
An app for an MP3 player
that recognizes your taste in music.

416
00:22:55,654 --> 00:22:56,848
Anybody try to buy it?

417
00:22:57,489 --> 00:22:58,513
Microsoft.

418
00:22:58,624 --> 00:23:00,683
Wow. How much?

419
00:23:00,793 --> 00:23:02,852
Didn't sell it. Uploaded it for free.

420
00:23:02,961 --> 00:23:04,622
- For free?
- Yeah.

421
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:05,923
Why?

422
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,325
Okay, well, we have something
that we've been working on for a while

423
00:23:10,436 --> 00:23:11,494
and we think it's great.

424
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:12,831
lt's called the Harvard Connection.

425
00:23:12,938 --> 00:23:16,339
You create your own page.
lnterests, bio, friends, pics.

426
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:18,706
And then people can go online,
see your bio, request to be your...

427
00:23:18,811 --> 00:23:21,211
Yeah, how is that different
from MySpace or Friendster?

428
00:23:24,516 --> 00:23:26,211
Harvard.edu.

429
00:23:26,318 --> 00:23:28,718
Harvard.edu is the most prestigious
e-mail address in the country, man.

430
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:31,153
l mean, the whole site's kind of
based on the idea that girls...

431
00:23:31,223 --> 00:23:33,123
Not to put anything indelicately, but...

432
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:34,955
Girls wanna go with guys
who go to Harvard.

433
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,358
Divya and my brother don't have trouble
putting things indelicately.

434
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:40,921
The main difference between what we're
talking about and MySpace or Friendster,

435
00:23:41,033 --> 00:23:42,432
or any of those other
social networking sites is...

436
00:23:42,534 --> 00:23:45,264
ls exclusivity. Right?

437
00:23:46,105 --> 00:23:47,163
- Right.
- Yeah.

438
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:48,706
We'd love for you to work with us, Mark.

439
00:23:48,774 --> 00:23:50,503
l mean, we need a gifted programmer
who's creative.

440
00:23:50,576 --> 00:23:52,203
And we know that
you've been taking it in the shins.

441
00:23:52,277 --> 00:23:55,212
Women's groups are ready
to declare a fatwa.

442
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,714
But, you know, this could help
rehabilitate your image.

443
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,748
Wow. You would do that for me?

444
00:24:03,388 --> 00:24:04,412
We'd like to work with you.

445
00:24:04,523 --> 00:24:07,583
Our first programmer graduated
and went to work for Google.

446
00:24:07,693 --> 00:24:10,253
Our second programmer
just got overwhelmed with schoolwork.

447
00:24:10,362 --> 00:24:13,559
We would need you to build the site and
write the code, and we'll provide all the...

448
00:24:13,632 --> 00:24:14,894
l'm in.

449
00:24:16,435 --> 00:24:17,561
What?

450
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,594
l'm in.

451
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:21,273
Awesome.

452
00:24:21,573 --> 00:24:22,733
That's what you said?

453
00:24:23,575 --> 00:24:26,135
lt was three or four years ago.
l don't know what l said.

454
00:24:26,245 --> 00:24:27,542
When did you come to Eduardo?

455
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,641
l don't understand that question.

456
00:24:29,748 --> 00:24:31,375
Do you remember answering
in the affirmative?

457
00:24:32,117 --> 00:24:33,243
The affirmative?

458
00:24:33,318 --> 00:24:35,286
When did you come to Eduardo
with the idea for Facebook?

459
00:24:35,621 --> 00:24:36,986
lt was called The Facebook then.

460
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,614
This doesn't need to be that difficult.

461
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:42,218
l'm currently in the middle
of two different lawsuits.

462
00:24:42,294 --> 00:24:43,659
Did you answer affirmatively

463
00:24:43,762 --> 00:24:46,230
when Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss
and Divya Narendra

464
00:24:46,298 --> 00:24:47,890
asked you to build Harvard Connection?

465
00:24:47,966 --> 00:24:49,627
Did you say yes?

466
00:24:51,303 --> 00:24:52,497
l said l'd help.

467
00:24:52,604 --> 00:24:55,596
When did you approach Mr. Saverin
with the idea for The Facebook?

468
00:24:55,674 --> 00:24:57,164
l wouldn't say l approached him.

469
00:24:57,309 --> 00:24:59,436
- Sy.
- You can answer the question.

470
00:24:59,511 --> 00:25:01,911
At a party at Alpha Epsilon Pi.

471
00:25:02,014 --> 00:25:03,413
What's that?

472
00:25:03,482 --> 00:25:05,416
The Jewish fraternity.

473
00:25:06,785 --> 00:25:08,252
lt was Caribbean Night.

474
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,200
lt's not that guys like me
are generally attracted to Asian girls.

475
00:25:28,307 --> 00:25:31,208
lt's that Asian girls are
generally attracted to guys like me.

476
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,335
l'm developing an algorithm
to define the connection

477
00:25:33,445 --> 00:25:35,345
between Jewish guys and Asian girls.

478
00:25:35,447 --> 00:25:38,439
l don't think it's that complicated.
They're hot, they're smart,

479
00:25:38,517 --> 00:25:41,452
they're not Jewish, and they can't dance.

480
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,019
Hey, Mark's here.

481
00:25:43,121 --> 00:25:44,281
Mark!

482
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:48,983
Be right back.

483
00:25:56,568 --> 00:25:57,626
l think l've come up with something.

484
00:25:57,703 --> 00:25:59,898
Hang on. l gotta tell you something
that you're not gonna believe.

485
00:26:00,005 --> 00:26:01,029
What?

486
00:26:01,139 --> 00:26:03,403
l got punched by the Phoenix.

487
00:26:04,676 --> 00:26:05,700
- Are you kidding?
- No.

488
00:26:05,811 --> 00:26:08,143
l mean, it's just the first
of a four-step process,

489
00:26:08,213 --> 00:26:11,011
but they slid the invitation
under my door tonight.

490
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:12,983
l go to my first punch party tomorrow.

491
00:26:13,051 --> 00:26:14,211
So...

492
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,711
You got punched by the Phoenix.

493
00:26:16,822 --> 00:26:19,484
Yeah, but, you know,
it was probably just a diversity thing.

494
00:26:20,025 --> 00:26:22,084
lt was just a diversity thing.
Just ride that horse until...

495
00:26:22,194 --> 00:26:23,889
What did you wanna talk to me about?

496
00:26:23,996 --> 00:26:25,429
- Mark?
- Yeah.

497
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:26,554
You said you'd come up with something.

498
00:26:26,665 --> 00:26:29,259
Yeah, l think l've come up with something.
Come outside and let's talk.

499
00:26:29,368 --> 00:26:30,665
lt's 20 degrees outside.

500
00:26:30,736 --> 00:26:32,897
l can't stare at that loop of Niagara Falls,

501
00:26:33,005 --> 00:26:35,064
which has absolutely
nothing to do with the Caribbean.

502
00:26:46,852 --> 00:26:48,217
People came to Facemash
in a stampede, right?

503
00:26:48,287 --> 00:26:49,379
Yeah.

504
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:51,046
But it wasn't because
they saw pictures of hot girls.

505
00:26:51,123 --> 00:26:53,353
You can go anywhere on the lnternet
and see pictures of hot girls.

506
00:26:53,425 --> 00:26:54,449
Yeah.

507
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,187
lt was because they saw pictures
of girls that they knew.

508
00:26:57,696 --> 00:26:59,630
People want to go on the lnternet
and check out their friends,

509
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:01,198
so why not build a website that offers that?

510
00:27:01,266 --> 00:27:04,394
Friends, pictures, profiles,
whatever you can visit.

511
00:27:04,469 --> 00:27:06,266
Browse around.
Maybe it's someone you just met at a party.

512
00:27:06,371 --> 00:27:08,464
But l'm not talking about a dating site.

513
00:27:08,573 --> 00:27:13,977
l'm talking about taking the entire social
experience of college and putting it online.

514
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:16,643
- l can't feel my legs.
- l know.

515
00:27:16,748 --> 00:27:18,272
l'm totally psyched about this, too.
But, Wardo?

516
00:27:18,383 --> 00:27:19,441
Yeah?

517
00:27:19,584 --> 00:27:21,609
"lt would be exclusive.''

518
00:27:22,087 --> 00:27:24,715
You would have to know the people
on the site to get past your own page.

519
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,655
Like getting punched.

520
00:27:27,626 --> 00:27:28,650
Now, that's good.

521
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,887
Wardo, it's like a final club,
except we're the president.

522
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:34,160
l told him l thought it sounded great.

523
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,299
lt was a great idea.

524
00:27:36,401 --> 00:27:37,425
There was nothing to hack.

525
00:27:37,502 --> 00:27:40,562
People were gonna provide
their own pictures, their own information.

526
00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:45,406
And people had the ability to invite,
or not invite, their friends to join.

527
00:27:46,078 --> 00:27:49,536
See, in a world where
social structure was everything,

528
00:27:50,182 --> 00:27:51,444
that was the thing.

529
00:27:52,017 --> 00:27:53,348
lt was a big project,

530
00:27:53,452 --> 00:27:56,615
and he was going to have to write
tens of thousands of lines of code,

531
00:27:56,688 --> 00:27:59,316
so l wondered why he was
coming to me and not his roommates,

532
00:27:59,391 --> 00:28:02,053
Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes.
They were programmers.

533
00:28:02,194 --> 00:28:05,527
We're gonna need a little start-up cash
to rent the servers and get it online.

534
00:28:06,698 --> 00:28:07,722
So that was why.

535
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:09,460
- Did he offer terms?
- Yes.

536
00:28:09,534 --> 00:28:11,468
We'll split it, 70<i>l</i>30.

537
00:28:11,636 --> 00:28:14,127
70 for me, 30 for you
for putting up the $1,000

538
00:28:14,206 --> 00:28:16,470
and for handling everything
on the business end. You're CFO.

539
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:17,565
<i>And you said?</i>

540
00:28:17,676 --> 00:28:19,303
l said, "Let's do it.''

541
00:28:19,378 --> 00:28:21,243
Okay. Did he add anything else?

542
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,704
Yes.

543
00:28:26,418 --> 00:28:28,978
lt probably was a diversity thing.

544
00:28:30,222 --> 00:28:31,382
But so what?

545
00:28:31,556 --> 00:28:32,853
Why do you think he said that?

546
00:28:32,924 --> 00:28:35,154
Gretchen, excuse me for interrupting,
but whose discovery is this?

547
00:28:35,227 --> 00:28:36,990
Sy, if you'll let me continue
with my line of questioning.

548
00:28:37,062 --> 00:28:38,154
What are you suggesting?

549
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,391
That l was jealous of Eduardo
for getting punched by the Phoenix

550
00:28:40,499 --> 00:28:42,057
and began a plan
to screw him out of a company

551
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:43,862
- l hadn't even invented yet.
- Were you?

552
00:28:43,935 --> 00:28:45,197
- Gretchen.
- Jealous of Eduardo?

553
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,532
Stop typing. We're off the record.

554
00:28:46,605 --> 00:28:47,663
Ma'am, l know you've done your homework,

555
00:28:47,739 --> 00:28:49,331
and so you know that money
isn't a big part of my life.

556
00:28:49,408 --> 00:28:51,399
But at the moment,
l could buy Mount Auburn Street,

557
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:54,673
take the Phoenix Club
and turn it into my ping-pong room.

558
00:28:58,917 --> 00:29:00,908
l'll let you know how the party is.

559
00:29:06,758 --> 00:29:10,057
<i>We recognize that you're a plaintiff</i>
<i>in one suit involving Facebook,</i>

560
00:29:10,228 --> 00:29:11,559
and a witness in another.

561
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,722
Yes, sir.

562
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:15,790
At any time in the weeks
prior to Mark's telling you his idea,

563
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:18,392
did he mention Tyler Winklevoss,
Cameron Winklevoss,

564
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,768
Divya Narendra or Harvard Connection?

565
00:29:20,872 --> 00:29:23,534
Yes. He said they'd asked him
to work on their site,

566
00:29:23,608 --> 00:29:27,544
but that he looked at what they had
and decided it wasn't worth his time.

567
00:29:27,612 --> 00:29:29,204
He said even his most pathetic friends

568
00:29:29,281 --> 00:29:33,149
knew more about getting people
interested in a website than these guys.

569
00:29:33,251 --> 00:29:35,151
"These guys," meaning my clients.

570
00:29:35,253 --> 00:29:39,212
Yes. He resented...
Mark resented that your clients thought

571
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:41,725
that he needed to rehabilitate
his image after Facemash.

572
00:29:41,793 --> 00:29:43,886
But Mark didn't want
to rehabilitate anything.

573
00:29:43,962 --> 00:29:46,760
With Facemash, he'd hacked into
the Harvard computers,

574
00:29:46,832 --> 00:29:49,460
he'd thumbed his nose at the Ad Board,
he'd gotten a lot of notoriety.

575
00:29:49,568 --> 00:29:52,162
Facemash did exactly
what he wanted it to do.

576
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:54,738
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg
was building The Facebook,

577
00:29:54,806 --> 00:29:56,603
he was also communicating
with the plaintiffs?

578
00:29:56,675 --> 00:29:58,836
Not at the time, l wasn't. But...

579
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:03,577
lt really didn't have much to do
with the Winklevosses' dating site.

580
00:30:03,648 --> 00:30:04,672
How would you know?
You weren't even there.

581
00:30:04,783 --> 00:30:05,841
Ty.

582
00:30:06,184 --> 00:30:09,278
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg
was building The Facebook,

583
00:30:09,354 --> 00:30:12,812
he was leading the plaintiffs to believe
he was building Harvard Connection?

584
00:30:12,924 --> 00:30:14,357
You're offering a conclusion
not found in evidence.

585
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:17,087
We are about to find it in evidence.

Okay, anybody else feel like
there's something up with this guy?

600

Tell him okay,

601
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:04,069
but we do have to make sure that
we meet up before we all go off for break.

602

l know, l know. Yeah, watch out.

603
00:31:38,343 --> 00:31:39,571
Hey, Mark.

604
00:31:39,678 --> 00:31:42,579
l need a dedicated Linux box
running Apache with a MySQL back end.

605
00:31:42,681 --> 00:31:44,171
lt's gonna cost a little more money.

606
00:31:44,249 --> 00:31:46,615
- How much more?
- About 200 more.

607
00:31:46,785 --> 00:31:49,219
- Do we need it?
- Gotta handle the traffic.

608
00:31:52,524 --> 00:31:54,424
- Do it.
- l already did.

609

Hey, guess what?

610
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,227
l made the second cut.

00:32:03,935 --> 00:32:04,959
That's good.

612
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:08,733
You should be proud of that right there.
Don't worry if you don't make it any further.

613
00:32:13,578 --> 00:32:15,011
l'll get out of here.

614
00:32:15,113 --> 00:32:17,445
<i>From Mark Zuckerberg</i>
<i>to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss</i>

615
00:32:17,515 --> 00:32:18,573
and Divya Narendra.

616
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,811
December 15th, 2003.

617
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:23,285
"l have a CS problem set
that l'm just getting started with

618
00:32:23,355 --> 00:32:27,018
"and it should be about 15 hours of coding,
so l'll be busy tomorrow night.''

619
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:30,458
"l won't really be free to meet
until next Wednesday afternoon.''

620
00:32:30,528 --> 00:32:32,655
"l have to cancel Wednesday afternoon.

621
00:32:32,764 --> 00:32:35,927
"l've basically been in the lab
this whole time, and also l...''

622
00:32:36,034 --> 00:32:40,630
"...won't be able to do Saturday,
as l have to meet up with my parents.''

623
00:32:44,776 --> 00:32:49,179
As the plaque reads, this is John Harvard,
founder of Harvard University in 1638.

624
00:32:49,281 --> 00:32:51,613
lt's also called the Statue of Three Lies.

625
00:32:52,384 --> 00:32:54,511
What are the three lies?

626
00:32:55,387 --> 00:32:56,479
Mr. Dowd.

627
00:32:56,621 --> 00:32:58,680
The three lies. First...

628
00:32:58,857 --> 00:32:59,881
Shit!

629
00:32:59,991 --> 00:33:01,822
- Take your pants off.
- l know.

630
00:33:02,994 --> 00:33:04,222
Mr. Saverin.

631
00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:07,856
One, Harvard was founded in 1636, not 1638.

632
00:33:07,966 --> 00:33:10,298
Two, Harvard was not founded
by John Harvard.

633
00:33:10,368 --> 00:33:11,892
And three, that is not John Harvard.

634
00:33:12,003 --> 00:33:13,334
Who is it?

635
00:33:13,905 --> 00:33:17,534
lt's a friend of the sculptor, Daniel Chester.

636
00:33:18,476 --> 00:33:19,568
Keep your jacket on.

637
00:33:23,548 --> 00:33:27,006
Thirty-nine days after Mr. Zuckerberg's
initial meeting with my clients,

638
00:33:27,085 --> 00:33:30,486
and he still hadn't completed work
on Harvard Connection.

639
00:33:30,588 --> 00:33:33,352
<i>But on January 1 1th, 2004,</i>

640
00:33:34,092 --> 00:33:37,323
<i>Mr. Zuckerberg registered</i>
<i>the domain name The Facebook</i>

641
00:33:37,395 --> 00:33:40,193
<i>via Network Solutions.</i>

642
00:33:41,366 --> 00:33:45,325
To the best of your knowledge, had he even
begun work on Harvard Connection?

643
00:33:46,504 --> 00:33:48,529
Not to my knowledge. No.

644
00:33:52,844 --> 00:33:54,937
What in the world is this?

645
00:33:56,081 --> 00:34:00,177
"Hey, Cameron, l'm still a little skeptical
that we have enough functionality in the site

646
00:34:00,251 --> 00:34:02,845
"to really draw the attention
and gain the critical mass necessary

647
00:34:03,054 --> 00:34:05,545
"to get a site like this to run"?

648
00:34:06,091 --> 00:34:07,456
"We'll speak soon"?

649
00:34:09,761 --> 00:34:12,389
This is the first time
he mentioned any problem?

650
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,554
Yes, it was.

651
00:34:13,631 --> 00:34:18,125
You sent 36 e-mails to Mr. Zuckerberg
and received 16 e-mails in return,

652
00:34:18,236 --> 00:34:20,796
and this was the first time
he indicated he was not happy.

653
00:34:20,905 --> 00:34:21,929
That's correct.

654
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,702
He had 42 days to study our system
and get out ahead.

655
00:34:24,776 --> 00:34:26,869
- Do you see any of your code on Facebook?
- Sy, could you...

656
00:34:26,945 --> 00:34:28,469
Did l use any of your code?

657
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,411
You stole our whole goddamn idea.

658
00:34:30,482 --> 00:34:32,712
- Fellas.
- What? Match.com for Harvard guys?

659
00:34:32,784 --> 00:34:33,910
Can l continue with my deposition?

660
00:34:33,985 --> 00:34:37,113
You know, you really don't need
a forensics team to get to the bottom of this.

661
00:34:37,222 --> 00:34:38,814
lf you guys were the inventors of Facebook,

662
00:34:40,225 --> 00:34:42,216
you'd have invented Facebook.

663
00:34:42,994 --> 00:34:45,588
l can't wait to stand over your shoulder
and watch you write us a check.

664
00:34:45,663 --> 00:34:46,960
No shit.

665
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:48,800
Let's continue.

666
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,062
Let's continue.

667
00:34:51,736 --> 00:34:54,170
February 4, 2004.

668
00:34:57,776 --> 00:34:58,936
Mark.

669
00:34:59,677 --> 00:35:00,837
Mark.

670
00:35:00,945 --> 00:35:04,813
There is a girl in your art history class.
Her name is Stephanie Attis.

671
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:06,781
Do you happen to know
if she has a boyfriend?

672
00:35:08,253 --> 00:35:10,448
Have you ever seen her with anyone?

673
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:15,784
And, if not, do you happen to know
if she's looking to go out with anyone?

674
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,122
Dustin.

675
00:35:18,596 --> 00:35:22,327
People don't walk around with
a sign on them that says...

676
00:35:26,471 --> 00:35:27,631
Mark?

677
00:35:54,232 --> 00:35:56,496
We were supposed to meet at 9:00.

678
00:35:56,568 --> 00:35:59,332
- Have you slept yet?
- l have to add something.

679
00:35:59,404 --> 00:36:00,564
What?

680
00:36:11,749 --> 00:36:13,717
Shit, that looks good.
That looks really good.

681
00:36:13,785 --> 00:36:15,252
lt's clean and simple.

682
00:36:15,353 --> 00:36:18,049
No Disneyland, no "live nude girls.''
But watch.

683
00:36:19,424 --> 00:36:21,187
What'd you write?

684
00:36:21,426 --> 00:36:24,224
"Relationship Status.' '"lnterested ln.''

685
00:36:24,362 --> 00:36:27,229
This is what drives life at college.
"Are you having sex or aren't you?"

686
00:36:27,298 --> 00:36:30,597
lt's why people take certain classes
and sit where they sit and do what they do.

687
00:36:30,702 --> 00:36:34,570
And at its center, you know, that's
what The Facebook is gonna be about.

688
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:36,869
People are gonna log on because
after all the cake and watermelon,

689
00:36:36,941 --> 00:36:37,965
there's a chance they're actually gonna...

690
00:36:38,076 --> 00:36:40,271
- Gonna get laid.
- ...meet a girl. Yes.

691
00:36:40,879 --> 00:36:41,903
That is really good.

692
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,038
And that was it.

693
00:36:43,114 --> 00:36:44,775
- What do you mean?
- lt's ready.

694
00:36:44,883 --> 00:36:46,976
- lt's ready? Right now?
- Yeah. That was it.

695
00:36:47,585 --> 00:36:49,075
And here's the masthead.

696
00:36:49,153 --> 00:36:50,620
- You made a masthead.
- Yeah.

697
00:36:50,722 --> 00:36:54,089
- "Eduardo Saverin, co-founder and CFO.''
- Yeah.

698
00:36:54,158 --> 00:36:56,217
You have no idea what
that's gonna mean to my father.

699
00:36:56,294 --> 00:36:57,625
Sure l do.

700
00:37:00,131 --> 00:37:02,156
So when's it going live?

701
00:37:02,767 --> 00:37:05,167
Right now. Get your laptop out.

702
00:37:05,837 --> 00:37:07,930
What? Why do we need my laptop?

703
00:37:08,006 --> 00:37:11,498
Because you got e-mails
for everybody at the Phoenix.

704
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:19,106
Yeah, l'm not sure if it's gonna be cool
with them that l spam their e-mails.

705
00:37:19,183 --> 00:37:21,913
- This is not spam.
- No, l know it's not spam.

706
00:37:21,986 --> 00:37:24,318
lf we send it to our friends,
it's just gonna bounce around Dworkin.

707
00:37:24,422 --> 00:37:25,753
l haven't gotten in yet.

708
00:37:25,823 --> 00:37:28,849
These guys know people.
And l need their e-mails.

709
00:37:30,695 --> 00:37:31,923
- Sure.
- Good.

710
00:37:33,164 --> 00:37:34,188
Give me the mailing list.

711
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:36,631
Jabberwock1 2.Iistserv@harvard.edu.

712
00:37:36,701 --> 00:37:37,861
These guys.

713
00:37:37,969 --> 00:37:38,993
Yeah, they're literary geniuses

714
00:37:39,103 --> 00:37:41,196
because the world's most obvious
Lewis Carroll reference is in...

715
00:37:41,306 --> 00:37:42,830
- They're not so bad.
- l'm just saying.

716
00:37:42,941 --> 00:37:44,704
Yeah, you're right.

717
00:37:51,616 --> 00:37:53,140
The site's live.

718
00:37:54,052 --> 00:37:56,282
You know, let's go get a drink and celebrate.

719
00:37:57,789 --> 00:37:59,188
l'm buying.

720
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:01,785
Mark.

721
00:38:04,562 --> 00:38:05,961
Mark, are you praying?

722
00:38:19,377 --> 00:38:21,902
Whatever happened to Cole Porter
and lrving Berlin?

723
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,071
lt's a Valentine's Day theme.
They're playing love songs.

724
00:38:24,182 --> 00:38:25,206
Good point.

725
00:38:25,316 --> 00:38:28,217
'Cause Cole Porter and lrving Berlin
never wrote any love songs.

726
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:34,390
Honey, you should put your laptop away.

727
00:38:34,492 --> 00:38:36,426
Seven different people
spammed me the same link.

728
00:38:36,527 --> 00:38:38,085
- KC.
- What is it?

729
00:38:38,196 --> 00:38:39,220
l don't know.

730
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:41,059
But l'm really hoping
it's Cats That Look Like Hitler,

731
00:38:41,165 --> 00:38:42,860
'cause l can never get enough of that.

732
00:38:45,036 --> 00:38:46,526
No, it's not.

733
00:38:50,074 --> 00:38:51,234
Div!

734
00:38:52,844 --> 00:38:54,004
What?

735
00:38:59,717 --> 00:39:00,741
This isn't mine.

736
00:39:01,552 --> 00:39:02,576
Okay, what is wrong?

737
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:08,024
lt's fine. lt's fine. lt's fine.

738
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,366
Hey!

739
00:39:24,609 --> 00:39:25,701
Hey!

740
00:39:25,777 --> 00:39:26,937
Not now!

741
00:39:27,045 --> 00:39:28,103
We need 20 minutes!

742
00:39:28,212 --> 00:39:29,577
Okay.

743
00:39:30,748 --> 00:39:33,911
l just wanted to let you know
that Zuckerberg stole our website.

744
00:39:35,486 --> 00:39:37,147
Mark Zuckerberg?

745
00:39:37,622 --> 00:39:39,453
He stole our website.

746
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:41,918
lt's been live for more than 36 hours.

747
00:39:47,131 --> 00:39:49,622
Mr. Hotchkiss?
Ty, lawyer's on the phone with Dad.

748
00:39:49,734 --> 00:39:52,259
Yes, sir, l'm here with my brother Tyler
and our business partner Divya.

749
00:39:52,336 --> 00:39:53,394
"Welcome to The Facebook.

750
00:39:53,471 --> 00:39:55,405
"The Facebook is an online directory
that connects people

"through different social networks.

00:39:57,008 --> 00:40:00,171
"You must have a harvard.edu address
to register.''

753
00:40:00,278 --> 00:40:02,746
Yeah, l called earlier.
l'm looking for Mark Zuckerberg.

754
00:40:02,814 --> 00:40:04,145
Yes, sir.
He's actually quoted a couple times.

755
00:40:04,248 --> 00:40:05,272
l can read it to you.

756
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:08,580
"'Everyone's been talking a lot about a
universal facebook within Harvard,' he says.''

757
00:40:08,653 --> 00:40:09,677
"He" meaning Mark.

758
00:40:09,787 --> 00:40:11,755
"'l think it's kind of silly
that it would take the university

"'l can do a classier job than they can
and l did it in a week.'"

761

Tell him Divya Narendra called.

762
00:40:16,961 --> 00:40:19,020
- l know, that's how he talks.
- Appreciate it.

763

"As of yesterday evening, Zuckerberg said,

766
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,037
Yeah, Divya was just reading that 650
students signed up for it on the first day.

767
00:40:32,143 --> 00:40:36,375
God, if l was a drug dealer l couldn't
give free drugs to 650 people in one day.

768
00:40:36,481 --> 00:40:40,008
And this guy doesn't have three friends
to rub together to make a fourth.

769
00:40:40,084 --> 00:40:41,574
All right.
Yes, that's what we'll do, Mr. Hotchkiss.

770
00:40:41,686 --> 00:40:43,586
We'll put all this together
and we'll e-mail it to you.

771
00:40:43,688 --> 00:40:45,383
Well, you won't be able
to go on the website yourself.

772
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,551
Because you don't have a Harvard...

773
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,990
You know what, it would just be easier
for us to e-mail it to you.

774
00:40:51,062 --> 00:40:52,086
l'm sure you're right.

775
00:40:52,196 --> 00:40:55,063
He's a good guy and he's very bright
and l'm sure he didn't mean to do...

776
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:56,258
Wow.

777
00:40:56,701 --> 00:40:57,759
...what he did.

778
00:40:58,669 --> 00:41:00,102
All right, thank you very much. And, Dad...

779
00:41:00,705 --> 00:41:01,729
All right, love you, too.

780
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,569
- This is a good guy?
- We don't know that he's not a good guy.

781
00:41:04,675 --> 00:41:05,699
We know he stole our idea.

782
00:41:05,777 --> 00:41:07,210
We know he lied to our faces
for a month and a half.

783
00:41:07,278 --> 00:41:09,405
- No, he never lied to our faces.
- Okay, he never saw our faces.

784
00:41:09,514 --> 00:41:12,915
Fine, he lied to our e-mail accounts
and he gave himself a 42-day head start,

785
00:41:13,017 --> 00:41:15,008
because he knows
what apparently you don't,

786
00:41:15,086 --> 00:41:16,849
which is that getting there first
is everything.

787
00:41:16,921 --> 00:41:17,945
l'm a competitive racer, Div.

788
00:41:18,055 --> 00:41:21,456
l don't think you need to school me in the
importance of getting there first. Thank you.

789
00:41:21,793 --> 00:41:23,886
- That was your father's lawyer?
- lt was his in-house counsel.

790
00:41:23,961 --> 00:41:25,861
He's gonna look at all this
and if he thinks it's appropriate

791
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:26,954
he'll send a cease-and-desist letter.

792
00:41:27,064 --> 00:41:28,088
What's that gonna do?

793
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:29,564
What, do you wanna hire an lP lawyer
and sue him?

794
00:41:29,634 --> 00:41:32,762
No, l wanna hire the Sopranos to beat
the shit out of him with a hammer.

795
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:33,962
- We don't even have to do that.
- That's right.

796
00:41:34,071 --> 00:41:37,370
We could do that ourselves.
l'm 6'5", 220, and there's two of me.

797
00:41:37,441 --> 00:41:38,465
- l'm with this guy.
- Well, whatever.

798
00:41:38,576 --> 00:41:40,942
l'm saying, let's calm down
until we know what we're talking about.

799
00:41:41,045 --> 00:41:43,104
How much more information
are you waiting for?

800
00:41:43,214 --> 00:41:46,081
We met with Mark three times,
we exchanged 52 e-mails,

801
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,742
we can prove that he looked at the code.

802
00:41:47,819 --> 00:41:50,913
- What is that on the bottom of the page?
- lt says "A Mark Zuckerberg production.''

803
00:41:50,988 --> 00:41:53,252
- On the home page?
- On every page.

804
00:41:53,324 --> 00:41:55,986
Shit, l need a second to let
the classiness waft over me.

805
00:41:56,093 --> 00:41:57,151
Okay, look, we don't know...

806
00:41:57,261 --> 00:41:59,161
Cam, they wrote, "Zuckerberg said
he hoped the privacy options

807
00:41:59,263 --> 00:42:01,128
"would help restore his reputation

808
00:42:01,265 --> 00:42:04,234
"following student outrage
over facemash.com.''

809
00:42:04,302 --> 00:42:07,669
That's exactly what we said to him.
He's giving us the finger in <i>The Crimson.</i>

810
00:42:08,306 --> 00:42:10,399
While we're waiting for Dad's lawyer
to look this stuff over,

811
00:42:10,474 --> 00:42:12,942
we can at least get something
going in the paper so people know...

812
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,500
- What?
- ...that this is in dispute.

813
00:42:14,612 --> 00:42:16,637
We're not starting a knife fight
in <i>The Crimson.</i>

814
00:42:16,747 --> 00:42:18,180
And we're not suing anybody.

815
00:42:18,282 --> 00:42:19,579
Why not?

816
00:42:21,018 --> 00:42:23,486
l don't understand, l don't understand.
Why not?

817
00:42:24,689 --> 00:42:26,486
He's gonna say it's stupid.

818
00:42:26,591 --> 00:42:27,615
What, who, me?

819
00:42:27,692 --> 00:42:29,159
Say it. Why not?

820
00:42:30,595 --> 00:42:32,756
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard.

821
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:37,199
This is Harvard, where you don't
plant stories and you don't sue people.

822
00:42:37,835 --> 00:42:40,770
You thought he was gonna be
the only one who thought that was stupid?

823
00:42:40,838 --> 00:42:43,534
During the time when you say
you had this idea,

824
00:42:44,175 --> 00:42:47,702
did you know Tyler and Cameron
came from a family of means?

825
00:42:48,446 --> 00:42:49,845
"A family of means"?

826
00:42:49,947 --> 00:42:51,471
Did you know their father was wealthy?

827
00:42:52,783 --> 00:42:54,011
l'm not sure why you're asking me that.

828
00:42:54,118 --> 00:42:56,382
lt's not important you be sure
why l'm asking.

829
00:42:56,487 --> 00:42:58,455
- lt's not important to you.
- Sy.

830
00:42:59,557 --> 00:43:01,388
Did you know that they came from money?

831
00:43:01,492 --> 00:43:03,392
l had no idea whether
they came from money or not.

832
00:43:03,494 --> 00:43:05,462
ln one of your e-mails to Mr. Narendra,

833
00:43:05,529 --> 00:43:08,896
you referenced Howard Winklevoss'
consulting firm.

834
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,228
lf you say so.

835
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:14,065
Howard Winklevoss founded a firm whose
assets are in the hundreds of millions.

836
00:43:14,171 --> 00:43:16,366
You also knew Tyler and Cameron
were members

837
00:43:16,474 --> 00:43:18,840
of a Harvard final club called the Porcellian.

838
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:20,138
They pointed that out.

839
00:43:20,211 --> 00:43:22,236
- Excuse us for inviting you in.
- To the bike room.

840
00:43:22,346 --> 00:43:26,305
Please. So it's safe to say you were aware
that my clients had money.

841
00:43:27,985 --> 00:43:29,009
Yes.

842
00:43:29,086 --> 00:43:30,519
Let me tell you why l'm asking.

843
00:43:30,588 --> 00:43:34,024
l'm wondering why, if you needed $1,000
for an lnternet venture,

844
00:43:34,091 --> 00:43:35,649
you didn't ask my clients for it.

845
00:43:35,726 --> 00:43:38,251
They had demonstrated an interest to you
in that kind of thing.

846
00:43:38,362 --> 00:43:41,422
l went to my friend for the money because
that's who l wanted to be partners with.

847
00:43:41,532 --> 00:43:44,023
Eduardo was the president of
the Harvard lnvestors Association,

848
00:43:44,101 --> 00:43:46,035
and he was also my best friend.

849
00:43:46,871 --> 00:43:50,500
Your best friend is suing you
for $600 million.

850
00:43:51,042 --> 00:43:53,408
l didn't know that. Tell me more.

851
00:43:53,544 --> 00:43:55,774
Eduardo, what happened
after the initial launch?

852
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,110
l'm sorry, Sy, would you mind
addressing him as Mr. Saverin?

853
00:43:58,215 --> 00:43:59,842
- Gretchen, they're best friends.
- Not anymore.

854
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:01,942
Well, we already went through this on the...
Never mind.

855
00:44:02,053 --> 00:44:04,681
Mr. Saverin, what happened
after the initial launch?

856
00:44:04,755 --> 00:44:06,188
lt exploded.

857
00:44:06,257 --> 00:44:08,088
Everybody on campus was using it.

858
00:44:08,192 --> 00:44:11,753
"Facebook me" was a common expression
after two weeks.

859
00:44:12,229 --> 00:44:13,253
And Mark?

860
00:44:13,364 --> 00:44:17,232
And Mark was the biggest thing on
a campus that included 19 Nobel laureates,

861
00:44:17,301 --> 00:44:21,795
15 Pulitzer Prize winners,
two future Olympians, and a movie star.

862
00:44:21,939 --> 00:44:23,531
Who was the movie star?

863
00:44:23,607 --> 00:44:25,199
Does it matter?

864
00:44:25,576 --> 00:44:26,634
No.

865
00:44:28,913 --> 00:44:32,679
...at Out of Town News and picked up
that copy of <i>Popular Electronics</i> magazine

866
00:44:32,783 --> 00:44:34,978
with the MlTS Altair kit on the cover.

867
00:44:35,086 --> 00:44:37,611
lt was a beautiful day
and l was in my Radcliffe dorm room.

868
00:44:37,688 --> 00:44:39,747
He brought that magazine up
and he showed it to me and he said,

869
00:44:39,824 --> 00:44:43,692
"Look, it's gonna happen without us.
We've gotta start now.''

870
00:44:43,794 --> 00:44:46,922
And l said, "Okay.
Let's get BASlC out there.''

871
00:44:47,531 --> 00:44:50,432
Now, most of you think you know
the rest of the story, but you may not.

872
00:44:50,501 --> 00:44:52,799
The beginnings of this industry
were very humble.

873
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:57,136
That kit computer on the cover of
that magazine had an 8080 processor in it.

874
00:44:57,208 --> 00:45:01,304
Unless you paid extra for
a 1 K memory board, you got 256 bytes.

875
00:45:01,879 --> 00:45:05,838
So the challenge when l wrote BASlC
wasn't just to run at 4 k-bytes,

876
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:10,819
but l also had to leave room for the users
to run their programs in 4 k-bytes.

877
00:45:12,023 --> 00:45:14,014
Your friend. ls that Mark Zuckerberg?

878
00:45:14,358 --> 00:45:15,382
Yeah.

879
00:45:15,493 --> 00:45:17,654
- He made The Facebook.
- Yeah.

880
00:45:18,029 --> 00:45:20,361
l mean, it's both of ours. We're...

881
00:45:20,464 --> 00:45:22,329
Yeah, we... Yes.

882
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,560
Cool.

883
00:45:23,834 --> 00:45:25,324
l'm Christy Ling. This is Alice.

884
00:45:25,403 --> 00:45:26,461
Hi.

885
00:45:26,537 --> 00:45:28,732
Well, very nice to meet you.

886
00:45:29,073 --> 00:45:30,563
Facebook me when you get home.

887
00:45:30,674 --> 00:45:32,198
You know, maybe we can all go out
and grab a drink.

888
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:34,034
Certainly.

889
00:45:34,211 --> 00:45:36,008
Absolutely do that.

890
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:46,017
She said, "Facebook me
and we can all go for a drink later,"

891
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:47,648
which is stunningly great for two reasons.

892
00:45:47,725 --> 00:45:50,421
One, she said "facebook me," right?
And then the other is, well, you know...

893
00:45:50,528 --> 00:45:51,552
They wanna have drinks later.

894
00:45:51,662 --> 00:45:53,254
Yes, have you ever heard
so many different good things

895
00:45:53,364 --> 00:45:54,888
packed into one regular-sized sentence?

896
00:45:54,999 --> 00:45:56,660
Excuse me, Mark?

897
00:45:57,201 --> 00:45:58,327
Yeah?

898
00:45:58,402 --> 00:46:00,199
l'm Stuart Singer. l'm in your OS lab.

899
00:46:00,905 --> 00:46:01,929
Sure.

900
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,271
- Awesome job with The Facebook.
- Awesome job.

901
00:46:04,375 --> 00:46:05,399
Thanks.

902
00:46:05,509 --> 00:46:07,340
- l'm Bob.
- How you doing?

903
00:46:07,411 --> 00:46:08,844
You know, l could swear
he was looking at you

904
00:46:08,913 --> 00:46:12,110
when he said the next Bill Gates
could be right in this room.

905
00:46:12,216 --> 00:46:13,706
l doubt it.

906
00:46:13,784 --> 00:46:16,275
And l showed up late.
l don't even know who the speaker was.

907
00:46:17,721 --> 00:46:19,188
lt was Bill Gates.

908
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:22,449
Shit, that makes sense.

909
00:46:23,294 --> 00:46:25,353
All right. Thanks, guys.

910
00:46:27,898 --> 00:46:29,593
- Are you a moron?
- Are you medically stupid?

911
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,395
You can't tell Bill Gates
is in front of you for an hour?

912
00:46:31,469 --> 00:46:33,300
l wasn't wearing my contacts.

913
00:46:33,404 --> 00:46:35,770
Can l get a Glock and kill you?

914
00:46:37,374 --> 00:46:38,966
lt's time to monetize the thing.

915
00:46:39,076 --> 00:46:40,373
What were their names?

916
00:46:40,444 --> 00:46:42,241
- Hear what l just said?
- When?

917
00:46:42,313 --> 00:46:44,372
l said it's time to monetize the site.

918
00:46:45,382 --> 00:46:46,406
What does that mean?

919
00:46:46,484 --> 00:46:49,317
lt means it's time for the website
to start generating revenue.

920
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,718
No, l know what the word means.
l'm asking how you wanna do it.

921
00:46:53,057 --> 00:46:54,752
- Advertising.
- No.

922
00:46:55,159 --> 00:46:57,286
Well, we got 4,000 members.

923
00:46:57,394 --> 00:46:58,554
'Cause The Facebook is cool,

924
00:46:58,629 --> 00:47:01,826
and if we start installing pop-ups
for Mountain Dew, it's not gonna be cool.

925
00:47:01,932 --> 00:47:03,559
Well, l wasn't thinking Mountain Dew,
but at some point,

926
00:47:03,634 --> 00:47:06,102
and l'm talking as the business end
of the company, the site...

927
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:09,401
We don't even know what it is yet.
We don't know what it is.

928
00:47:09,473 --> 00:47:11,941
We don't know what it can be.
We don't know what it will be.

929
00:47:12,009 --> 00:47:13,340
We know that it is cool.

930
00:47:13,444 --> 00:47:15,639
That is a priceless asset l'm not giving up.

931
00:47:15,746 --> 00:47:17,941
- So when will it be finished?
- lt won't be finished.

932
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,744
That's the point.
The way fashion's never finished.

933
00:47:19,817 --> 00:47:22,115
- What?
- Fashion. Fashion is never finished.

934
00:47:22,186 --> 00:47:23,653
You're talking about fashion? Really, you?

935
00:47:23,754 --> 00:47:26,314
l'm talking about the idea of it
and l'm saying that it's never finished.

936
00:47:26,423 --> 00:47:29,756
Okay. But they manage
to make money selling pants.

937
00:47:31,028 --> 00:47:32,518
Mark, what is this?

938
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:34,097
- What?
- This.

939
00:47:34,165 --> 00:47:36,463
lt's called a cease-and-desist letter.
What were their names?

940
00:47:36,534 --> 00:47:37,592
- Who?
- The girls.

941
00:47:37,668 --> 00:47:38,828
When did you get this?

942
00:47:38,936 --> 00:47:41,029
About 10 days ago.
Right after we launched the site.

943
00:47:41,138 --> 00:47:42,969
- Jesus Christ.
- Hey, the girls. What were their names?

944
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,168
The Winklevoss twins are saying
that you stole their idea.

945
00:47:46,277 --> 00:47:48,643
l find that to be a little more
than mildly annoying.

946
00:47:48,712 --> 00:47:51,977
Oh, well, they find it to be
intellectual property theft.

947
00:47:52,049 --> 00:47:53,277
- Look...
- Why didn't you show this to me?

948
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:54,840
lt was addressed to me.

949
00:47:54,952 --> 00:47:58,046
They're saying that we stole The Facebook
from Divya Narendra and the Winklevosses.

950
00:47:58,155 --> 00:48:00,180
- l know what it says.
- Did we?

951
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:01,315
Did we what?

952
00:48:01,392 --> 00:48:02,984
Don't screw around with me now.
Look at me.

953
00:48:03,627 --> 00:48:05,322
The letter says we could face legal action.

954
00:48:05,396 --> 00:48:07,057
No, it says l could face legal action.

955
00:48:07,164 --> 00:48:09,394
This is from a lawyer, Mark.
They must feel they have some grounds.

956
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,628
- The lawyer is their father's house counsel.
- Do they have grounds?

957
00:48:12,703 --> 00:48:14,136
The grounds are
our thing is cool and popular,

958
00:48:14,205 --> 00:48:15,638
and Harvard Connection is lame.

959
00:48:15,706 --> 00:48:17,970
Wardo, l didn't use any of their code,
l promise.

960
00:48:18,042 --> 00:48:19,066
l didn't use anything.

961
00:48:19,176 --> 00:48:21,007
Look, a guy who builds a nice chair
doesn't owe money

962
00:48:21,078 --> 00:48:22,705
to everyone who ever
has built a chair, okay?

963
00:48:22,813 --> 00:48:24,644
They came to me with an idea,
l had a better one.

964
00:48:24,715 --> 00:48:27,411
- Why didn't you show me this letter?
- l didn't think it was a big deal.

965
00:48:29,753 --> 00:48:30,913
Okay.

966
00:48:32,223 --> 00:48:37,855
So if there's something wrong, if there's
ever anything wrong, you can tell me.

967
00:48:38,095 --> 00:48:40,563
l'm the guy that wants to help.
This is our thing.

968
00:48:40,631 --> 00:48:44,089
Now, is there anything
that you need to tell me?

969
00:48:44,568 --> 00:48:45,626
No.

970
00:48:48,939 --> 00:48:50,463
What are we doing about this?

971
00:48:50,574 --> 00:48:53,975
l went to a 3L at Student Legal Services
and he told me to write them back.

972
00:48:54,078 --> 00:48:55,238
And what did you say?

973
00:48:55,312 --> 00:48:58,440
"When we met in January,
l expressed my doubts about the site.

974
00:48:58,549 --> 00:49:00,915
"Where it stood with graphics,
how much programing was left

975
00:49:00,985 --> 00:49:02,418
"that l had not anticipated.''

976
00:49:02,486 --> 00:49:04,750
"The lack of hardware
we had to deal with site use,

977
00:49:04,822 --> 00:49:08,087
"the lack of promotion that would go on
to successfully launch the website.''

978
00:49:08,158 --> 00:49:11,753
This was the first time you raised
any of those concerns, right?

979
00:49:11,829 --> 00:49:13,456
l'd raised concerns before.

980
00:49:13,564 --> 00:49:14,792
- Bullshit.
- Not to us.

981
00:49:14,898 --> 00:49:18,925
Gentlemen, l'm talking about at the meeting
in January to which this letter is referring.

982
00:49:19,003 --> 00:49:20,061
Yeah.

983
00:49:20,137 --> 00:49:22,002
Let me rephrase this.

984
00:49:22,306 --> 00:49:26,766
You sent my client 16 e-mails.
ln the first 15 you didn't raise any concerns.

985
00:49:26,844 --> 00:49:27,936
ls that a question?

986
00:49:28,012 --> 00:49:31,573
ln the 16th e-mail you raised concerns
about the site's functionality.

987
00:49:31,649 --> 00:49:34,413
- Were you leading them on for six weeks?
- No.

988
00:49:34,485 --> 00:49:37,579
Then why didn't you raise
any of these concerns before?

989
00:49:37,655 --> 00:49:39,520
- lt's raining.
- l'm sorry?

990
00:49:39,623 --> 00:49:40,851
lt just started raining.

991
00:49:40,958 --> 00:49:44,018
Mr. Zuckerberg,
do l have your full attention?

992
00:49:44,862 --> 00:49:45,954
No.

993
00:49:47,031 --> 00:49:48,430
Do you think l deserve it?

994
00:49:48,699 --> 00:49:49,757
What?

995
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:52,802
Do you think l deserve your full attention?

996
00:49:53,337 --> 00:49:55,362
l had to swear an oath
before we began this deposition

997
00:49:55,472 --> 00:49:58,600
and l don't wanna perjure myself,
so l have a legal obligation to say no.

998
00:49:58,676 --> 00:50:02,476
Okay. No.
You don't think l deserve your attention?

999
00:50:02,546 --> 00:50:05,606
l think if your clients wanna sit on
my shoulders and call themselves tall,

1000
00:50:05,683 --> 00:50:06,809
they have a right to give it a try,

1001
00:50:06,884 --> 00:50:10,217
but there's no requirement that l enjoy
sitting here listening to people lie.

1002
00:50:11,388 --> 00:50:13,720
You have part of my attention.
You have the minimum amount.

1003
00:50:14,558 --> 00:50:17,026
The rest of my attention is
back at the offices of Facebook,

1004
00:50:17,127 --> 00:50:19,391
where my colleagues and l are doing things
that no one in this room,

1005
00:50:19,496 --> 00:50:21,054
including and especially your clients,

1006
00:50:21,165 --> 00:50:24,498
are intellectually or creatively
capable of doing.

1007
00:50:25,369 --> 00:50:28,304
Did l adequately answer
your condescending question?

1008
00:50:35,379 --> 00:50:38,974
Well, l have 12:45.
Why don't we say that's lunch?

1009
00:50:40,751 --> 00:50:42,241
Back at 2:30.

1010
00:50:43,153 --> 00:50:45,212
So what were their names?

1011
00:50:46,824 --> 00:50:49,019
Their names were Christy and Alice,

1012
00:50:51,495 --> 00:50:54,089
and they wanna have drinks tonight.

1013
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:59,598
You're not supposed to be in here.
This is a men's room.

1014
00:51:03,674 --> 00:51:04,834
Wow.

1015
00:51:18,856 --> 00:51:20,255
Oh, my God.

1016
00:51:21,191 --> 00:51:22,681
l don't care.

1017
00:51:44,648 --> 00:51:45,876
Hey, man, sorry.

1018
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:48,884
A couple girls are freshening up in there.

1019
00:51:50,053 --> 00:51:51,281
Sweet.

1020
00:51:55,726 --> 00:51:57,421
We have groupies.

1021
00:52:05,936 --> 00:52:07,233
l'll be right back.

1022
00:52:07,304 --> 00:52:09,101
Mark, where you going? Mark.

1023
00:52:14,344 --> 00:52:15,402
Erica?

1024
00:52:17,314 --> 00:52:18,338
Hi.

1025
00:52:18,449 --> 00:52:21,077
l saw you from over there.
l didn't know you came to this club a lot.

1026
00:52:21,151 --> 00:52:22,846
- First time.
- Mine, too.

1027
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,817
Could l talk to you alone for a second?

1028
00:52:26,089 --> 00:52:27,283
l think l'm good right here.

1029
00:52:27,357 --> 00:52:31,418
l just... l'd love to talk to you alone
if we could just go someplace.

1030
00:52:31,495 --> 00:52:32,757
Right here is fine.

1031
00:52:33,497 --> 00:52:35,522
l don't know if you heard about
this new website l launched.

1032
00:52:35,632 --> 00:52:36,690
No.

1033
00:52:37,534 --> 00:52:40,298
- The Facebook?
- You called me a bitch on the lnternet, Mark.

1034
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:42,201
That's why l wanted to talk to you.

1035
00:52:42,306 --> 00:52:44,297
- On the lnternet.
- That's why l came over.

1036
00:52:44,374 --> 00:52:46,001
Comparing women to farm animals.

1037
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:47,977
l didn't end up doing that.

1038
00:52:48,045 --> 00:52:49,706
lt didn't stop you from writing it.

1039
00:52:49,813 --> 00:52:52,373
As if every thought that tumbles
through your head was so clever

1040
00:52:52,483 --> 00:52:54,747
it would be a crime for it not to be shared.

1041
00:52:56,353 --> 00:52:58,878
The lnternet's not written in pencil, Mark,
it's written in ink,

1042
00:52:58,989 --> 00:53:01,890
and you published that Erica Albright
was a bitch,

1043
00:53:01,992 --> 00:53:06,361
right before you made some ignorant crack
about my family's name, my bra size,

1044
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:08,261
and then rated women
based on their hotness.

1045
00:53:09,533 --> 00:53:11,501
- Erica, is there a problem?
- No, there's no problem.

1046
00:53:12,669 --> 00:53:14,694
You write your snide bullshit
from a dark room

1047
00:53:14,771 --> 00:53:17,569
because that's what the angry do nowadays.

1048
00:53:18,542 --> 00:53:20,601
l was nice to you. Don't torture me for it.

1049
00:53:20,711 --> 00:53:22,679
lf we could just go somewhere for a minute...

1050
00:53:22,746 --> 00:53:24,941
l don't wanna be rude to my friends.

1051
00:53:25,048 --> 00:53:26,208
Okay.

1052
00:53:26,283 --> 00:53:27,443
Okay.

1053
00:53:29,253 --> 00:53:31,619
Good luck with your video game.

1054
00:53:31,722 --> 00:53:33,622
Hey, that was great.
That was the right thing to do.

1055
00:53:33,724 --> 00:53:35,624
You apologized, right?

1056
00:53:38,428 --> 00:53:39,622
We have to expand.

1057
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:41,129
Sure. Mark?

1058
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,067
ls he mad about something?

1059
00:53:46,136 --> 00:53:48,297
Okay, we are expanding
to Yale and Columbia.

1060
00:53:48,405 --> 00:53:50,100
Dustin, l want you to share
the coding work with me.

1061
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:51,970
Chris, you're gonna be in charge
of publicity and outreach,

1062
00:53:52,075 --> 00:53:54,270
and you could start by getting a story
in the BU student newspaper.

1063
00:53:54,378 --> 00:53:55,402
lt's <i>The Bridge.</i>

1064
00:53:55,479 --> 00:53:56,741
They hate doing stories about Harvard.

1065
00:53:56,813 --> 00:53:58,747
Somebody at the newspaper
will be a computer science major.

1066
00:53:58,815 --> 00:54:01,249
Tell them that Mark Zuckerberg
will do 10 hours of free programing.

1067
00:54:01,318 --> 00:54:03,047
Why do you want a story
in the BU newspaper?

1068
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,314
Because l do. Now here's the arrangement.

1069
00:54:04,421 --> 00:54:06,412
Eduardo is CFO
and owns 30 % of the company.

1070
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:08,048
Dustin is vice president
and head of programing,

1071
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:10,719
and his 5 % of the company
will come from my end.

1072
00:54:10,794 --> 00:54:12,091
Chris is director of publicity,

1073
00:54:12,162 --> 00:54:14,562
and his compensation will depend on
how much work he ends up doing.

1074
00:54:14,631 --> 00:54:15,655
Any questions?

1075
00:54:15,766 --> 00:54:19,327
- Who are the girls?
- Sorry. They're Christy and Alice.

1076
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:20,730
- Hi.
- Hi.

1077
00:54:20,804 --> 00:54:22,237
- Hello.
- Hi.

1078
00:54:22,739 --> 00:54:24,138
ls there anything we can do?

1079
00:54:24,241 --> 00:54:25,299
No, that's it.

1080
00:54:25,409 --> 00:54:27,741
- Yale and Columbia, let's go.
- And Stanford.

1081
00:54:28,445 --> 00:54:30,436
- What?
- Stanford.

1082
00:54:30,514 --> 00:54:32,744
lt's time for them to see this in Palo Alto.

1083
00:54:38,622 --> 00:54:39,953
You don't want any lunch?

1084
00:54:40,023 --> 00:54:41,115
No.

1085
00:54:41,525 --> 00:54:43,186
You're welcome to some salad.

1086
00:54:43,293 --> 00:54:44,817
No, thank you.

1087
00:54:51,134 --> 00:54:52,158
This must be hard.

1088
00:54:53,704 --> 00:54:54,762
Who are you?

1089
00:54:55,305 --> 00:54:57,830
l'm Marylin Delpy.
l introduced myself when we first...

1090
00:54:57,941 --> 00:54:59,306
l mean, what do you do?

1091
00:54:59,376 --> 00:55:01,503
l'm a second-year associate at the firm.

1092
00:55:01,612 --> 00:55:04,172
My boss wanted me to sit in
on the deposition phase.

1093
00:55:05,816 --> 00:55:06,976
What are you doing?

1094
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:10,042
Checking in to see how it's going in Bosnia.

1095
00:55:10,153 --> 00:55:11,381
Bosnia.

1096
00:55:11,622 --> 00:55:14,682
They don't have roads,
but they have Facebook.

1097
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:22,360
You must really hate the Winklevosses.

1098
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,462
l don't hate anybody.

1099
00:55:25,702 --> 00:55:28,967
The Winklevi aren't suing me
for intellectual property theft.

1100
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:31,564
They are suing me because
for the first time in their lives,

1101
00:55:31,675 --> 00:55:34,075
things didn't work out the way
they were supposed to for them.

1102
00:55:41,551 --> 00:55:43,212
He's expanding.

1103
00:55:43,387 --> 00:55:44,479
What?

1104
00:55:44,554 --> 00:55:45,987
He's expanding
to Yale, Columbia and Stanford.

1105
00:55:46,189 --> 00:55:47,213
lt's gonna be in <i>The Crimson</i> tomorrow.

1106
00:55:47,324 --> 00:55:48,348
- Really?
- Yep.

1107
00:55:48,492 --> 00:55:51,689
Well, looks like that cease-and-desist letter
really scared the shit out of him, huh?

1108
00:55:51,762 --> 00:55:55,061
l wanna hire a lawyer to file for injunctive
relief and get the site taken down now.

1109
00:55:55,165 --> 00:55:58,100
Every minute the site is up,
Harvard Connection becomes less valuable.

1110
00:55:58,201 --> 00:56:00,999
l want an injunction. l want damages.
l want punitive relief.

1111
00:56:01,071 --> 00:56:02,095
And l want him dead.

1112
00:56:02,205 --> 00:56:03,263
Yeah, l want those things, too.

1113
00:56:03,373 --> 00:56:04,670
Then why aren't we doing anything about it?

1114
00:56:04,741 --> 00:56:06,038
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard?

1115
00:56:06,109 --> 00:56:07,838
No, it's because you're not thinking
how it's gonna look.

1116
00:56:07,911 --> 00:56:08,935
How's it gonna look?

1117
00:56:09,046 --> 00:56:10,240
Like my brother and l
are in skeleton costumes

1118
00:56:10,347 --> 00:56:12,577
chasing the Karate Kid
around a high school gym.

1119
00:56:12,716 --> 00:56:16,277
Cam, he's violated Massachusetts state law.

1120
00:56:16,386 --> 00:56:18,217
When he goes to Connecticut,
New York and California,

1121
00:56:18,288 --> 00:56:19,619
he'll have violated federal law.

1122
00:56:19,723 --> 00:56:21,520
And, by the way,
he's in violation of Harvard law.

1123
00:56:21,591 --> 00:56:23,525
There's no such thing as Harvard law.

1124
00:56:23,593 --> 00:56:26,084
Wait. Yeah, there is.

1125
00:56:31,134 --> 00:56:32,533
Harvard Student Handbook.

1126
00:56:32,602 --> 00:56:35,400
Every freshman is issued one of these,
and somewhere in this book it says...

1127
00:56:35,472 --> 00:56:36,905
You can't steal from another student.

1128
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:40,604
This is what we needed.
We're going to Summers.

1129
00:56:40,711 --> 00:56:42,576
Well, you can't get a meeting
with Larry Summers.

1130
00:56:42,946 --> 00:56:44,470
My brother and l,
we pay tuition at this school.

1131
00:56:44,581 --> 00:56:47,778
We carry a 3.9 GPA at this school.
We've won trophies for this school.

1132
00:56:47,884 --> 00:56:50,318
And we'll be rowing in the Olympics
for this school.

1133
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:53,878
l want a meeting with
the goddamn president of this school.

1134
00:56:53,957 --> 00:56:55,447
Why Stanford?

1135
00:56:55,592 --> 00:56:57,321
Why do you think?

1136
00:57:01,598 --> 00:57:02,963
l'm sorry.

1137
00:57:03,166 --> 00:57:04,633
l'm late for biochem.

1138
00:57:06,436 --> 00:57:07,460
Okay.

1139
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:11,437
You don't know my name, do you?

1140
00:57:12,142 --> 00:57:13,268
ls it Stanford?

1141
00:57:13,877 --> 00:57:15,936
l should just kick your ass.

1142
00:57:16,012 --> 00:57:18,207
How do you go to a party
and you meet someone...

1143
00:57:18,315 --> 00:57:21,512
Amelia Ritter, but you prefer Amy.
You're from Orinda.

1144
00:57:21,618 --> 00:57:24,781
Your father's in commercial real estate
and your mother's 10 years sober.

1145
00:57:25,222 --> 00:57:26,450
What's my major?

1146
00:57:26,957 --> 00:57:28,515
- Trombone.
- Really?

1147
00:57:29,159 --> 00:57:31,059
l remember something about a trombone.

1148
00:57:34,831 --> 00:57:36,128
French.

1149
00:57:36,233 --> 00:57:37,291
Your major's French.

1150
00:57:37,367 --> 00:57:39,062
- And yours?
- Mine?

1151
00:57:39,169 --> 00:57:41,330
- l don't have one.
- You haven't declared?

1152
00:57:42,572 --> 00:57:43,800
l don't go to school.

1153
00:57:43,874 --> 00:57:45,705
- You're kidding.
- No.

1154
00:57:46,076 --> 00:57:48,044
Well, where did you go to school?

1155
00:57:48,145 --> 00:57:50,511
William Taft Elementary, for a little while.

1156
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:51,638
Seriously?

1157
00:57:52,315 --> 00:57:54,647
You're not like 15 years old or anything,
are you?

1158
00:57:55,252 --> 00:57:56,378
No.

1159
00:57:57,087 --> 00:57:58,179
Wait, you're not like 15, are you?

1160
00:57:58,255 --> 00:57:59,347
No.

1161
00:58:01,024 --> 00:58:02,548
So, what do you do?

1162
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,352
l'm an entrepreneur.

1163
00:58:05,428 --> 00:58:07,896
- You're unemployed.
- l wouldn't say that.

1164
00:58:07,998 --> 00:58:09,090
What would you say?

1165
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:10,325
That l'm an entrepreneur.

1166
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,095
Well, then, what was your latest preneur?

1167
00:58:12,202 --> 00:58:16,832
Well, l founded an lnternet company that
let folks download and share music for free.

1168
00:58:16,907 --> 00:58:18,238
Kind of like Napster?

1169
00:58:18,341 --> 00:58:19,774
Exactly like Napster.

1170
00:58:19,876 --> 00:58:21,537
What do you mean?

1171
00:58:21,611 --> 00:58:22,908
l founded Napster.

1172
00:58:23,013 --> 00:58:25,004
Sean Parker founded Napster.

1173
00:58:25,081 --> 00:58:26,412
Nice to meet you.

1174
00:58:26,516 --> 00:58:28,347
You're Sean Parker?

1175
00:58:28,518 --> 00:58:30,281
You see, the shoe's on the other...

1176
00:58:30,387 --> 00:58:32,412
- Foot?
- Table, which has turned.

1177
00:58:33,723 --> 00:58:35,247
l just slept with Sean Parker?

1178
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:37,053
You just slept on Sean Parker.

1179
00:58:37,427 --> 00:58:39,691
- You're a zillionaire.
- Not technically.

1180
00:58:39,763 --> 00:58:41,253
What are you?

1181
00:58:41,932 --> 00:58:43,593
Broke. There's not
a lot of money in free music,

1182
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:47,033
even less when you're being sued by
everyone who's ever been to the Grammys.

1183
00:58:47,103 --> 00:58:48,593
This is blowing my mind.

1184
00:58:48,705 --> 00:58:49,729
l appreciate that.

1185
00:58:49,806 --> 00:58:51,637
l gotta hop in the shower
and get ready for class.

1186
00:58:51,741 --> 00:58:55,142
Biochem, even though you're
a French major whose name is Amy.

1187
00:58:55,645 --> 00:58:56,873
You passed.

1188
00:58:57,247 --> 00:58:58,271
l'm a hard worker.

1189
00:58:59,883 --> 00:59:03,649
There's juice or anything else you can find.
Help yourself.

1190
00:59:03,753 --> 00:59:04,777
You mind if l check my e-mail?

1191
00:59:05,388 --> 00:59:06,946
Yeah, go ahead.

1192
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,160
Amy!

1193
00:59:20,337 --> 00:59:21,497
Jesus.

1194
00:59:21,605 --> 00:59:23,903
- Amy! Can you come out here?
- Yeah?

1195
00:59:24,774 --> 00:59:26,264
Just a second.

1196
00:59:29,279 --> 00:59:30,746
There's a snake in here, Amy.

1197
00:59:30,814 --> 00:59:31,906
What?

1198
00:59:34,351 --> 00:59:35,443
Where?

1199
00:59:35,518 --> 00:59:36,951
There isn't a snake,
but l need to ask you something.

1200
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:39,011
Are you kidding me? l could've been killed.

1201
00:59:39,122 --> 00:59:40,248
How?

1202
00:59:40,323 --> 00:59:44,089
By running too fast
and getting twisted in the curtain.

1203
00:59:44,294 --> 00:59:45,852
What do you need to ask me?

1204
00:59:45,962 --> 00:59:48,760
Yeah, l went to check my e-mail and
there's a website open on your computer.

1205
00:59:49,633 --> 00:59:53,125
Yeah, after you passed out last night
l went on The Facebook for a little bit.

1206
00:59:53,203 --> 00:59:55,364
- What's that?
- The Facebook?

1207
00:59:55,472 --> 00:59:58,441
Stanford's had it for, like, two weeks now.

1208
00:59:58,642 --> 01:00:01,770
lt's really awesome,
except it's freakishly addictive.

1209
01:00:01,845 --> 01:00:04,177
Seriously, l'm on the thing
like five times a day.

1210
01:00:04,281 --> 01:00:05,805
Mind if l send myself an e-mail?

1211
01:00:05,882 --> 01:00:07,372
Yeah, is everything okay?

1212
01:00:07,484 --> 01:00:09,281
Everything's great.

1213
01:00:10,053 --> 01:00:14,285
l just need to find you, Mark Zuckerberg.

1214
01:00:18,228 --> 01:00:19,786
l've never been in this building before.

1215
01:00:19,863 --> 01:00:24,232
This building's 100 years older
than the country it's in, so do be careful.

1216
01:00:25,568 --> 01:00:27,229
We're sitting in chairs.

1217
01:00:28,038 --> 01:00:29,164
Yes.

1218
01:00:30,073 --> 01:00:32,371
Very good. You can go in now.

1219
01:00:36,846 --> 01:00:39,679
That's their own stupidity.
l should've been there.

1220
01:00:39,749 --> 01:00:41,341
Well, darkness is the absence of light,

1221
01:00:41,418 --> 01:00:44,251
and the stupidity in that instance
was the absence of me.

1222
01:00:44,354 --> 01:00:46,254
Catherine, l've got students
in my office now.

1223
01:00:46,356 --> 01:00:48,221
Students. Undergrads.

1224
01:00:48,825 --> 01:00:49,849
l don't know.

1225
01:00:49,926 --> 01:00:52,690
From the looks of it, they want
to sell me a Brooks Brothers franchise.

1226
01:00:52,762 --> 01:00:53,990
All right, bye-bye.

1227
01:00:54,864 --> 01:00:55,888
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

1228
01:00:55,999 --> 01:00:57,899
l'm Cameron Winklevoss
and this is my brother, Tyler.

1229
01:00:58,001 --> 01:01:00,094
And you're here because...

1230
01:01:01,538 --> 01:01:02,562
Either of you can answer.

1231
01:01:02,672 --> 01:01:04,196
l'm sorry, sir,
l thought you were reading the letter.

1232
01:01:04,274 --> 01:01:05,332
l've read the letter.

1233
01:01:05,408 --> 01:01:08,673
Well, we came up with an idea for
a website called Harvard Connection...

1234
01:01:08,745 --> 01:01:11,942
We've since changed the name to ConnectU.
And Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea...

1235
01:01:12,048 --> 01:01:13,447
l understand.

1236
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:16,041
And l'm asking what you want me
to do about it.

1237
01:01:16,119 --> 01:01:20,055
Well, sir, in the Harvard Student Handbook,
which is distributed to each freshman,

1238
01:01:20,123 --> 01:01:22,455
under the heading "Standards of Conduct
in the Harvard Community,"

1239
01:01:22,892 --> 01:01:26,191
it says the college expects all students
to be honest and forthcoming

1240
01:01:26,262 --> 01:01:28,696
in their dealings with members
in this community.

1241
01:01:28,765 --> 01:01:31,256
Students are required to respect
public and private ownership,

1242
01:01:31,901 --> 01:01:33,801
and instances of theft, misappropriation or...

1243
01:01:33,903 --> 01:01:35,393
- Anne?
- Yes, sir?

1244
01:01:35,472 --> 01:01:37,269
Punch me in the face. Go ahead.

1245
01:01:40,243 --> 01:01:44,236
...or unauthorized use
will result in disciplinary action,

1246
01:01:44,314 --> 01:01:46,282
including the requirement
to withdraw from the college.

1247
01:01:46,383 --> 01:01:48,476
And you memorized that
instead of doing what?

1248
01:01:48,585 --> 01:01:51,986
What my brother and l came here today
to ask of you, respectfully, of course...

1249
01:01:52,088 --> 01:01:55,251
Sir, it's against university rules to steal
from another student, plain and simple.

1250
01:01:55,325 --> 01:01:56,553
And you've spoken to your House Master?

1251
01:01:56,626 --> 01:01:58,992
Yes, sir. And the House Master made
a recommendation to the Ad Board,

1252
01:01:59,095 --> 01:02:00,653
but the Ad Board won't see us.

1253
01:02:00,764 --> 01:02:02,561
Have you tried dealing with
the other student directly?

1254
01:02:02,632 --> 01:02:05,499
Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't been responding
to any of our e-mails or phone calls

1255
01:02:05,602 --> 01:02:06,660
for the last two weeks.

1256
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:08,601
He doesn't answer when
we knock on his door at Kirkland,

1257
01:02:08,671 --> 01:02:10,502
and the closest l've come
to dealing with him face-to-face

1258
01:02:10,607 --> 01:02:12,905
is when l saw him on the quad
and chased him through Harvard Square.

1259
01:02:12,976 --> 01:02:14,068
You chased him?

1260
01:02:14,144 --> 01:02:16,738
l saw him and l know he saw me.
l went after him and then he disappeared.

1261
01:02:17,614 --> 01:02:20,947
- l don't see this as a university issue.
- Of course this is a university issue.

1262
01:02:21,017 --> 01:02:23,417
There's a code of ethics and an honor code
and he violated them both.

1263
01:02:23,486 --> 01:02:26,944
You enter into a code of ethics with
the university, not with each other.

1264
01:02:27,791 --> 01:02:30,988
l'm sorry, President Summers, but what
you just said makes no sense to me at all.

1265
01:02:31,094 --> 01:02:32,254
l'm devastated by that.

1266
01:02:32,328 --> 01:02:34,990
What my brother means is, if
Mark Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room

1267
01:02:35,098 --> 01:02:37,259
and stole our computer,
that would be a university issue.

1268
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:39,665
l really don't know.
This office doesn't handle petty larceny.

1269
01:02:39,769 --> 01:02:41,100
This isn't petty larceny.

1270
01:02:41,171 --> 01:02:43,366
This idea is potentially worth
millions of dollars.

1271
01:02:43,473 --> 01:02:44,633
- Millions?
- Yes.

1272
01:02:44,707 --> 01:02:47,301
You might just be letting
your imaginations run away with you.

1273
01:02:47,377 --> 01:02:50,175
Sir, l honestly don't think you're
in any position to make that call.

1274
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:54,546
l was the US Treasury Secretary.
l'm in some position to make that call.

1275
01:02:54,651 --> 01:02:55,982
Letting our imaginations run away with us

1276
01:02:56,052 --> 01:02:57,952
is exactly what we were told to do
in your freshman address.

1277
01:02:58,021 --> 01:03:01,013
Well, then l would suggest
that you let your imaginations

1278
01:03:01,124 --> 01:03:02,489
run away with you on a new project.

1279
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:03,685
You would?

1280
01:03:03,793 --> 01:03:05,226
Yes. Everyone at Harvard's
inventing something.

1281
01:03:05,328 --> 01:03:09,958
Harvard undergraduates believe that
inventing a job is better than finding a job.

1282
01:03:10,333 --> 01:03:13,825
So l'll suggest again that the two of you
come up with a new new project.

1283
01:03:13,903 --> 01:03:16,997
- l'm sorry, sir, but that's not the point.
- Please, arrive at the point.

1284
01:03:17,073 --> 01:03:18,836
You don't have to be
an intellectual property expert

1285
01:03:18,908 --> 01:03:20,398
to understand the difference
between right and wrong.

1286
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:22,341
And you're saying that l don't?

1287
01:03:22,412 --> 01:03:24,380
- Of course l'm not saying that, sir.
- l'm saying that.

1288
01:03:24,481 --> 01:03:26,176
- Really?
- Sir.

1289
01:03:26,382 --> 01:03:28,316
Anne, how did they get this appointment?

1290
01:03:28,384 --> 01:03:30,318
Colleagues of their father.

1291
01:03:31,855 --> 01:03:34,187
Let me tell you something,
Mr. Winklevoss, Mr. Winklevoss,

1292
01:03:34,257 --> 01:03:36,691
since you're on the subject
of right and wrong.

1293
01:03:36,759 --> 01:03:40,991
This action, this meeting,
the two of you being here is wrong.

1294
01:03:41,264 --> 01:03:44,563
lt's not worthy of Harvard.
lt's not what Harvard saw in you.

1295
01:03:44,667 --> 01:03:47,067
You don't get special treatment.

1296
01:03:47,237 --> 01:03:49,705
- We never asked...
- Just start another project?

1297
01:03:49,772 --> 01:03:51,603
Like we're making a diorama
for a science fair?

1298
01:03:51,708 --> 01:03:53,198
lf you have a problem
with that, Mr. Winklevoss...

1299
01:03:53,276 --> 01:03:54,334
We never asked for special treatment.

1300
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:58,107
...the courts are always at your disposal.
ls there anything else l can do for you?

1301
01:03:58,214 --> 01:03:59,875
You can take the Harvard
Student Handbook and shove it...

1302
01:03:59,949 --> 01:04:01,007
Ty.

1303
01:04:01,684 --> 01:04:03,879
Thank you very much for your time, sir.

1304
01:04:09,125 --> 01:04:10,387
Whoops.

1305
01:04:10,627 --> 01:04:13,118
Broke your 335-year-old doorknob.

1306
01:04:14,731 --> 01:04:17,894
Eduardo, spring break, you
and Mr. Zuckerberg took a trip to New York.

1307
01:04:17,967 --> 01:04:20,527
- Yes.
- What was the purpose of the trip?

1308
01:04:20,603 --> 01:04:24,300
Well, as CFO, l had set up some meetings
with potential advertisers.

1309
01:04:25,074 --> 01:04:26,098
Who paid for the trip?

1310
01:04:26,209 --> 01:04:29,303
lt was paid for out of the $1,000 account
l had set up a few months earlier.

1311
01:04:29,412 --> 01:04:33,246
At this point, your $1,000 was the only
money that had been put into the company?

1312
01:04:33,316 --> 01:04:35,284
- Yes.
- How did you feel the meetings went?

1313
01:04:36,786 --> 01:04:38,879
- They went terribly.
- Why?

1314
01:04:39,088 --> 01:04:40,214
Mark was asleep.

1315
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:41,723
l was not asleep.

1316
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:43,122
Can l rephrase my answer?

1317
01:04:43,293 --> 01:04:45,318
l wish he'd been asleep.

1318
01:04:48,097 --> 01:04:51,589
So we're in 29 schools now,
with over 75,000 members.

1319
01:04:52,435 --> 01:04:53,595
People who go on The Facebook

1320
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:56,070
tend to stay on longer
than almost any other website.

1321
01:04:56,139 --> 01:04:57,936
Now, here's the most impressive statistic.

1322
01:04:58,007 --> 01:05:00,976
91 % of people who try it once
will come back.

1323
01:05:01,077 --> 01:05:02,942
- Now, if you'll allow me...
- Excuse me one second.

1324
01:05:03,079 --> 01:05:05,411
What sound is he making? ls that like a tsk?

1325
01:05:08,418 --> 01:05:10,079
lt wasn't a tsk.

1326
01:05:10,253 --> 01:05:11,584
lt was...

1327
01:05:12,488 --> 01:05:14,319
Like a glottal stop.

1328
01:05:14,824 --> 01:05:16,655
Almost a gag reflex.

1329
01:05:18,261 --> 01:05:19,990
Guys, what is this?

1330
01:05:20,096 --> 01:05:22,792
There was one more meeting scheduled
for the New York trip.

1331
01:05:22,865 --> 01:05:24,162
Yes, it was a dinner.

1332
01:05:24,267 --> 01:05:25,666
lt was set up through
my girlfriend at the time.

1333
01:05:25,835 --> 01:05:28,827
Would you say that Mark was
excited about this meeting?

1334
01:05:28,938 --> 01:05:31,168
Yes. Very.

1335
01:05:31,274 --> 01:05:33,299
- Look, they're not gonna card us.
- They might.

1336
01:05:33,376 --> 01:05:35,207
- l mean, look around.
- lt'll be embarrassing.

1337
01:05:35,311 --> 01:05:38,109
- Tell him they're not gonna card us.
- They're not gonna card us.

1338
01:05:38,181 --> 01:05:40,149
- Mark...
- Are you gonna talk about ads again?

1339
01:05:40,216 --> 01:05:41,945
Unless you're the ballet theater of Hartford,

1340
01:05:42,018 --> 01:05:44,009
the purpose of a business
is to make a profit.

1341
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:45,280
lt isn't a business yet.

1342
01:05:45,355 --> 01:05:49,155
That's tough for me, 'cause my...
Never mind.

1343
01:05:52,161 --> 01:05:53,526
He's 25 minutes late.

1344
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:56,394
He founded Napster when he was 19.
He can be late.

1345
01:05:56,499 --> 01:05:58,126
- He's not a god.
- Then what is he?

1346
01:05:58,201 --> 01:05:59,691
He's 25 minutes late.

1347
01:05:59,802 --> 01:06:01,064
l think Wardo's jealous.

1348
01:06:01,204 --> 01:06:04,332
l honestly wasn't jealous. l was nervous.

1349
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:05,564
Why?

1350
01:06:05,675 --> 01:06:09,167
Well, l didn't know him at all, but l had
done a search and l'd asked around.

1351
01:06:09,245 --> 01:06:12,510
And he struck me as kind of a...

1352
01:06:14,417 --> 01:06:15,850
A wild card.

1353
01:06:16,052 --> 01:06:17,076
Why?

1354
01:06:17,186 --> 01:06:20,519
He crashed out of two pretty big
lnternet companies in spectacular fashion,

1355
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:21,989
he's had a reputation with drugs...

1356
01:06:22,058 --> 01:06:23,320
He also founded the companies.

1357
01:06:23,393 --> 01:06:24,724
We don't need him.

1358
01:06:25,361 --> 01:06:26,419
He's here.

1359
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:31,157
No, no, take your time.

1360
01:06:31,234 --> 01:06:33,998
- And he does own a watch.
- Stop it.

1361
01:06:35,872 --> 01:06:37,066
- l'm Sean Parker.
- How do you do?

1362
01:06:37,173 --> 01:06:40,108
You must be Eduardo. And Christy.
And Mark.

1363
01:06:40,209 --> 01:06:42,177
- Great to meet you.
- Great to meet you.

1364
01:06:42,245 --> 01:06:43,769
You guys don't have anything
in front of you.

1365
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:44,904
- No.
- Tori.

1366
01:06:45,014 --> 01:06:46,038
We were waiting.

1367
01:06:46,115 --> 01:06:48,276
- Hey, baby boy.
- Can you bring out some things?

1368
01:06:48,384 --> 01:06:51,217
The lacquered pork with that ginger confit.
Tuna tartare?

1369
01:06:51,287 --> 01:06:53,118
And the lobster claws, that'll get us started.

1370
01:06:53,222 --> 01:06:55,087
Christy, what do you like to drink?

1371
01:06:56,726 --> 01:06:57,920
An appletini.

1372
01:06:58,027 --> 01:07:00,052
Great. Four of those.

1373
01:07:00,763 --> 01:07:03,425
From that point on, it was a Seanathon.

1374
01:07:12,308 --> 01:07:14,936
The question was,
"What did you talk about?"

1375
01:07:26,422 --> 01:07:28,720
He took us through his episode
with Napster.

1376
01:07:28,791 --> 01:07:31,817
l didn't wanna spend my 20s
as a professional defendant.

1377
01:07:31,928 --> 01:07:34,988
Who knew? The music industry
doesn't have a sense of humor.

1378
01:07:35,098 --> 01:07:38,329
We tried to sell the company to pay the
35 million they said we owed in royalties,

1379
01:07:38,434 --> 01:07:42,894
but l guess to them that was a little like
selling a stolen car to pay for the stolen gas.

1380
01:07:43,606 --> 01:07:46,074
So we said screw it, declared bankruptcy.

1381
01:07:46,175 --> 01:07:48,803
- But you made a name for yourself.
- And you are dry.

1382
01:07:48,911 --> 01:07:50,640
- Tori!
- No, no, l'm good.

1383
01:07:50,747 --> 01:07:52,942
And then he went on to
his second business venture,

1384
01:07:53,483 --> 01:07:56,646
which was an online Rolodex that
he got thrown out of by Case Equity.

1385
01:07:57,019 --> 01:07:58,748
And l wanted to do it nice this time.

1386
01:07:59,188 --> 01:08:02,783
l put on a tie and l shined my shoes,
but nobody wants to take orders from a kid.

1387
01:08:02,859 --> 01:08:05,794
So let me tell you what happens to
a 20-year-old at the top of a hot dot-com.

1388
01:08:05,862 --> 01:08:08,990
- l'm not a psychiatrist, but...
- l'm glad we've got that on the record.

1389
01:08:09,098 --> 01:08:11,362
You're not a psychiatrist, but what?

1390
01:08:11,467 --> 01:08:14,300
A psychiatrist would say
that he was paranoid.

1391
01:08:14,504 --> 01:08:16,938
They'll hire private detectives
who'll follow you day and night.

1392
01:08:17,006 --> 01:08:19,133
You're a target for high-priced escorts.

1393
01:08:19,208 --> 01:08:21,540
l can't prove it,
but l know they tap my phones.

1394
01:08:21,644 --> 01:08:24,204
Whatever it is that's gonna trip you up,
you've done already.

1395
01:08:24,313 --> 01:08:26,838
Private behavior is a relic
of a time gone by.

1396
01:08:26,949 --> 01:08:29,816
And if somehow, someway, you've managed
to live your life like the Dalai Lama,

1397
01:08:29,886 --> 01:08:31,046
they'll make shit up.

1398
01:08:31,154 --> 01:08:33,679
Because they don't want you,
they want your idea.

1399
01:08:34,023 --> 01:08:35,547
And they want you
to say "thank you" while you...

1400
01:08:35,992 --> 01:08:37,016
Excuse me.

1401
01:08:37,126 --> 01:08:38,559
...wipe your chin and walk away.

1402
01:08:38,661 --> 01:08:39,719
That's what happened to you?

1403
01:08:39,829 --> 01:08:41,387
And delusional.

1404
01:08:42,064 --> 01:08:45,124
Yes. But there'll be payback at Case.

1405
01:08:45,201 --> 01:08:46,793
l brought down the record companies
with Napster

1406
01:08:46,869 --> 01:08:48,200
and Case'll suffer for their sins, too.

1407
01:08:48,304 --> 01:08:50,795
Sorry, you didn't bring down
the record companies.

1408
01:08:51,207 --> 01:08:52,231
They won.

1409
01:08:52,375 --> 01:08:54,070
- ln court.
- Yeah.

1410
01:08:54,410 --> 01:08:56,970
You wanna buy a Tower Records, Eduardo?

1411
01:08:59,415 --> 01:09:02,816
And he told story after story
about life in Silicon Valley,

1412
01:09:02,885 --> 01:09:06,878
and parties at Stanford and down in LA,
and friends who'd become millionaires...

1413
01:09:07,023 --> 01:09:11,926
But mostly how Mark had to...
He had to come to California.

1414
01:09:12,829 --> 01:09:15,161
And then he got around to The Facebook.

1415
01:09:15,264 --> 01:09:17,732
So, tell me about your progress.

1416
01:09:17,834 --> 01:09:21,429
Well, we're in 29 schools now.
We got over 75,000 members.

1417
01:09:21,571 --> 01:09:23,266
- Tell me about the strategy you're using.
- Okay.

1418
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:25,373
For instance, we wanted Baylor, in Texas,

1419
01:09:25,441 --> 01:09:27,272
but Baylor already had
a social network on campus.

1420
01:09:27,376 --> 01:09:28,934
So instead of going right after them,

1421
01:09:29,045 --> 01:09:31,104
we made a list of every school
within 100 miles...

1422
01:09:31,214 --> 01:09:32,238
You put The Facebook
on those campuses first.

1423
01:09:32,348 --> 01:09:35,181
Pretty soon all the Baylor kids saw
their friends on our site and we were in.

1424
01:09:35,251 --> 01:09:36,616
lt's called the Little Bighorn.
That's smart, Mark.

1425
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:38,084
- Thanks, that was mine.
- Easy.

1426
01:09:38,187 --> 01:09:39,950
Hey, you know what?
Settle an argument for us.

1427
01:09:40,056 --> 01:09:41,956
l say it's time to start making money
from The Facebook,

1428
01:09:42,058 --> 01:09:43,923
but Mark doesn't want advertising.
Who's right?

1429
01:09:44,026 --> 01:09:45,254
Well...

1430
01:09:45,928 --> 01:09:47,225
Neither of you yet.

1431
01:09:47,296 --> 01:09:49,628
The Facebook is cool,
that's what it's got going for it.

1432
01:09:49,732 --> 01:09:50,756
Yeah.

1433
01:09:50,867 --> 01:09:52,562
You don't wanna ruin it with ads
because ads aren't cool.

1434
01:09:52,635 --> 01:09:53,693
Exactly.

1435
01:09:53,769 --> 01:09:55,259
lt's like you're throwing
the greatest party on campus

1436
01:09:55,371 --> 01:09:56,633
and someone's saying
it's gotta be over by 11 :00.

1437
01:09:56,739 --> 01:09:57,763
That's exactly right.

1438
01:09:57,874 --> 01:10:00,035
- You don't even know what the thing is yet.
- Exactly.

1439
01:10:00,109 --> 01:10:03,840
How big it can get, how far it can go.
This is no time to take your chips down.

1440
01:10:03,913 --> 01:10:05,847
A million dollars isn't cool.
You know what's cool?

1441
01:10:05,915 --> 01:10:06,939
You?

1442
01:10:09,752 --> 01:10:11,083
"A billion dollars.''

1443
01:10:14,724 --> 01:10:16,282
And that shut everybody up.

1444
01:10:16,392 --> 01:10:19,452
And that's where you're headed.
A billion-dollar valuation.

1445
01:10:20,229 --> 01:10:22,891
Unless you take bad advice, in which case
you may as well have come up with

1446
01:10:22,965 --> 01:10:24,796
a chain of very successful yogurt shops.

1447
01:10:25,368 --> 01:10:29,031
When you go fishing, you can catch
a lot of fish or you can catch a big fish.

1448
01:10:29,105 --> 01:10:32,404
You ever walk into a guy's den and see
a picture of him standing next to 14 trout?

1449
01:10:32,475 --> 01:10:34,306
- No, he's holding a 3,000-pound marlin.
- Yep.

1450
01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:35,468
- That's a good analogy.
- Okay.

1451
01:10:35,578 --> 01:10:37,944
But we all know marlins don't really
weigh 3,000 pounds, right?

1452
01:10:38,047 --> 01:10:39,071
Have you seen the big ones up close?

1453
01:10:39,148 --> 01:10:42,117
No, but l don't think the guy's holding
a marlin the size of a Range Rover.

1454
01:10:42,218 --> 01:10:44,880
That would be a really big fish
and a very strong guy.

1455
01:10:44,954 --> 01:10:46,478
You think we might be getting away
from the point?

1456
01:10:46,589 --> 01:10:50,889
l don't have a dog in this fight.
l'm just a fan who came to say hi.

1457
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:52,791
He owned Mark after that dinner.

1458
01:10:53,729 --> 01:10:56,095
He picked up the check,
he told Mark they'd talk again soon,

1459
01:10:56,165 --> 01:10:57,257
and he was gone.

1460
01:10:57,333 --> 01:11:01,235
But not before he made his biggest
contribution to the company.

1461
01:11:03,606 --> 01:11:06,074
Drop the "The.' ' Just"Facebook.''

1462
01:11:06,642 --> 01:11:08,166
lt's cleaner.

1463
01:11:11,113 --> 01:11:12,137
Shit.

1464
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:15,908
Goodbye, sweetie.

1465
01:11:16,953 --> 01:11:18,147
Yeah.

1466
01:11:22,024 --> 01:11:24,959
That's gotta be some kind of
land speed record for talking.

1467
01:11:25,027 --> 01:11:27,188
You wanna end the party at 11 :00.

1468
01:11:28,164 --> 01:11:31,429
- l'm trying to pay for the party.
- There won't be a party unless it's cool.

1469
01:11:32,635 --> 01:11:33,693
So, what do you think?

1470
01:11:33,803 --> 01:11:35,771
Yeah, sure, let's drop the "The.''

1471
01:11:35,838 --> 01:11:38,966
l meant to catching the marlin
instead of the 14 trout.

1472
01:11:39,041 --> 01:11:40,338
Doesn't that sound good?

1473
01:11:40,443 --> 01:11:42,411
lf you're a trout.

1474
01:11:42,411 --> 01:11:43,776
l'm going to enter this into the record.

1475
01:11:43,846 --> 01:11:47,782
lncorporation papers for Facebook,
an LLC registered in Florida.

1476
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:49,943
- Why Florida?
- lt's where my family lives.

1477
01:11:50,019 --> 01:11:52,613
And ask the respondent to stipulate
that the articles of incorporation

1478
01:11:52,788 --> 01:11:56,451
65 % for Mark Zuckerberg,

1479
01:11:56,525 --> 01:11:59,653
30 % for Eduardo Saverin
and 5 % for Dustin Moskovitz.

1480
01:11:59,729 --> 01:12:00,821
Yeah, we stipulate.

1481
01:12:00,896 --> 01:12:03,797
- And that was April 13th, 2004.
- You can mark it.

1482
01:12:03,866 --> 01:12:05,493
You have anything here?

1483
01:12:05,568 --> 01:12:06,865
Yes. Thank you.

1484
01:12:06,969 --> 01:12:09,665
Mr. Saverin, have you ever done anything

1485
01:12:09,739 --> 01:12:12,333
that might be considered
legitimate grounds for termination?

1486
01:12:14,176 --> 01:12:15,200
No.

1487
01:12:15,311 --> 01:12:19,839
You never did anything to embarrass the
company or even seriously jeopardize it?

1488
01:12:20,483 --> 01:12:21,848
- No.
- No?

1489
01:12:25,421 --> 01:12:26,479
No.

1490
01:12:26,555 --> 01:12:28,716
You were accused of animal cruelty.

1491
01:12:30,326 --> 01:12:32,760
- Wait.
- You weren't?

1492
01:12:32,862 --> 01:12:35,092
This is not happening.

1493
01:12:35,197 --> 01:12:37,529
l have here an article from <i>The Crimson...</i>

1494
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:38,692
Jesus Christ.

1495
01:12:38,768 --> 01:12:39,826
l can't have this, Wardo.

1496
01:12:39,902 --> 01:12:43,360
Come on, man. This is bullshit.
This is another club playing a prank.

1497
01:12:44,907 --> 01:12:47,171
l'd gotten into the Phoenix.

1498
01:12:47,243 --> 01:12:49,871
l'd been accepted,
and as part of my initiation l had to,

1499
01:12:49,945 --> 01:12:53,938
for one week, carry with me at all times
and take care of a chicken.

1500
01:12:54,050 --> 01:12:56,678
They identify you
as one of the founders of Facebook.

1501
01:12:56,752 --> 01:12:58,117
"Junior Eduardo Saverin...''

1502
01:12:58,220 --> 01:13:00,188
l'm not the expert, but being connected
to torturing animals

1503
01:13:00,256 --> 01:13:01,587
is probably bad for business.

1504
01:13:01,691 --> 01:13:06,526
l did not torture the chicken.
l don't torture chickens. Are you crazy?

1505
01:13:06,595 --> 01:13:10,429
No, and settle down, please.
l have here an article from <i>The Crimson...</i>

1506
01:13:10,533 --> 01:13:12,296
- This is scathing.
- 956.

1507
01:13:12,468 --> 01:13:15,232
l was having dinner in
the Kirkland dining hall with Mark,

1508
01:13:15,638 --> 01:13:17,037
and l had the chicken with me,

1509
01:13:17,106 --> 01:13:19,097
because l had to have the chicken
with me at all times.

1510
01:13:19,208 --> 01:13:20,266
This was college.

1511
01:13:20,376 --> 01:13:22,435
- Somebody's gonna have to answer for this.
- 969.

1512
01:13:22,912 --> 01:13:25,073
And the dining hall
was serving chicken for dinner,

1513
01:13:25,147 --> 01:13:27,581
and l had to feed my chicken, so l...

1514
01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:30,881
Well, l took little pieces of chicken
and l gave it to the chicken.

1515
01:13:31,454 --> 01:13:33,115
Someone must have seen me,
because the next thing l knew

1516
01:13:33,222 --> 01:13:34,917
l was being accused of forced cannibalism.

1517
01:13:35,891 --> 01:13:38,382
l didn't know you couldn't do that.

1518
01:13:38,794 --> 01:13:40,785
l dealt with the various animal rights groups,

1519
01:13:40,896 --> 01:13:43,091
l dealt with the associate dean
of the college.

1520
01:13:43,399 --> 01:13:45,060
This was all resolved.

1521
01:13:45,134 --> 01:13:46,158
988.

1522
01:13:46,268 --> 01:13:48,293
Someone from the Porc or the Fly
must have reported it.

1523
01:13:48,404 --> 01:13:50,235
For all l know, it was the Winklevosses.

1524
01:13:50,306 --> 01:13:52,001
All right, let's just forget about it.

1525
01:13:52,108 --> 01:13:55,077
This is absurd.
l'm being accused of animal cruelty.

1526
01:13:55,144 --> 01:13:56,611
lt's better to be accused of necrophilia.

1527
01:13:56,679 --> 01:13:58,306
lt is better to be accused of necrophilia.

1528
01:13:58,414 --> 01:14:01,781
Now l have to explain this to my father.
l'm gonna have to explain this to everybody.

1529
01:14:01,851 --> 01:14:03,284
What is happening on that?

1530
01:14:03,352 --> 01:14:05,445
l have my final coming up
for Postwar and Contemporary Art

1531
01:14:05,521 --> 01:14:06,783
and l haven't been to class.

1532
01:14:06,856 --> 01:14:08,118
l'm supposed to write about
these four paintings.

1533
01:14:08,491 --> 01:14:09,822
That's a Facebook page?

1534
01:14:09,925 --> 01:14:10,949
Yeah. l opened it under an alias.

1535
01:14:11,026 --> 01:14:12,459
l posted the paintings
and asked people to comment.

1536
01:14:12,528 --> 01:14:15,520
Every once in a while, l hop on
and stir the pot to get a good debate going.

1537
01:14:15,631 --> 01:14:18,031
Mr. Zuckerberg was cheating
on his final exam?

1538
01:14:18,134 --> 01:14:20,932
- l'd rather not answer that, Gretchen.
- And why not?

1539
01:14:21,003 --> 01:14:23,767
Because l'm not suing him
for cheating on his final exam.

1540
01:14:23,839 --> 01:14:27,002
- That's not what friends do.
- Well, you just told us he was cheating.

1541
01:14:27,943 --> 01:14:28,967
Oops.

1542
01:14:31,313 --> 01:14:33,281
You told your lawyers
l was torturing animals?

1543
01:14:33,349 --> 01:14:34,976
No, he didn't tell us about it at all.

1544
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:37,814
Our litigators are capable
of finding a <i>Crimson</i> article.

1545
01:14:37,887 --> 01:14:40,617
ln fact, when we raised the subject with him,
he defended you.

1546
01:14:43,058 --> 01:14:44,116
Oops.

1547
01:14:44,527 --> 01:14:46,552
993. We are so close.

1548
01:14:47,196 --> 01:14:50,359
Yeah, that reminds me,
we're gonna need more money, Wardo.

1549
01:14:50,466 --> 01:14:52,491
Yeah, no, l agree. More servers, more help.

1550
01:14:52,568 --> 01:14:54,331
l'm interviewing two interns
to come to Palo Alto

1551
01:14:54,403 --> 01:14:55,495
and we're gonna have
to pay them something.

1552
01:14:55,571 --> 01:14:57,539
- Sorry, what?
- l already found a house for rent

1553
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,369
on a street
two blocks from the Stanford campus.

1554
01:14:59,475 --> 01:15:00,806
lt is perfect and it's got a pool.

1555
01:15:00,876 --> 01:15:02,867
When did you decide to go to California
for the summer?

1556
01:15:02,978 --> 01:15:04,206
You mean when did l actually decide?

1557
01:15:04,313 --> 01:15:07,476
Was it somewhere in the middle
of the Sean Parker Variety Hour?

1558
01:15:07,883 --> 01:15:10,078
He was right,
California's the place we've gotta be.

1559
01:15:10,186 --> 01:15:11,585
What, you're Jed Clampett?

1560
01:15:11,687 --> 01:15:13,712
l didn't know you guys
got <i>The Beverly Hillbillies</i> in Brazil.

1561
01:15:13,823 --> 01:15:15,484
Yeah, got the show in Brazil, it was genius.

1562
01:15:15,925 --> 01:15:18,894
- What is your problem with Sean?
- He doesn't bring anything to the table.

1563
01:15:18,994 --> 01:15:21,019
He doesn't have money.
Dustin's a better programmer.

1564
01:15:21,096 --> 01:15:24,691
- He's got connections to VCs.
- We don't need VCs, we need advertisers.

1565
01:15:24,767 --> 01:15:26,701
- And l have connections to VCs.
- No real players.

1566
01:15:26,769 --> 01:15:29,363
And as somebody who's just really
embarrassed the company in a bad way...

1567
01:15:29,438 --> 01:15:31,668
- lt was the Winklevosses, Mark.
- Hang on.

1568
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:33,207
Hit "Refresh.''

1569
01:15:33,909 --> 01:15:37,037
150,004.

1570
01:15:37,112 --> 01:15:39,512
150,000 members, Wardo.

1571
01:15:39,882 --> 01:15:41,213
- Congratulations, dude.
- Congratulations.

1572
01:15:41,917 --> 01:15:45,751
You don't think it was strange that
he was followed by private detectives?

1573
01:15:45,855 --> 01:15:47,516
Who came up with nothing.

1574
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:49,558
Enough to get him out of the company.
The drugs, the girls.

1575
01:15:49,625 --> 01:15:51,752
- We don't know that any of that's true.
- You can read about it.

1576
01:15:51,861 --> 01:15:53,385
l can read about you torturing birds.
Since when...

1577
01:15:53,462 --> 01:15:57,125
Okay, don't fish eat other fish?
The marlins and the trout?

1578
01:15:59,635 --> 01:16:00,693
What's he talking about?

1579
01:16:00,769 --> 01:16:03,431
l'm interviewing interns at 10:00
tomorrow night in the CS lab.

1580
01:16:03,539 --> 01:16:04,699
Get on board with this, man.

1581
01:16:04,773 --> 01:16:07,298
You know, l don't really know
what else to say.

1582
01:16:30,666 --> 01:16:33,066
You can do one more! One more!

1583
01:16:37,773 --> 01:16:38,797
Wardo!

1584
01:16:38,908 --> 01:16:40,170
Yo! Mark!

1585
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,135
What's going on?

1586
01:16:43,245 --> 01:16:45,611
They have 10 minutes to get root access
to a Python web server,

1587
01:16:45,681 --> 01:16:46,978
expose its SSL encryption,

1588
01:16:47,082 --> 01:16:48,674
and then intercept all traffic
over its secure port.

1589
01:16:48,817 --> 01:16:49,841
They're hacking.

1590
01:16:49,985 --> 01:16:51,976
Yes, all behind a Pix Firewall Emulator.
But here's the beauty.

1591
01:16:52,087 --> 01:16:53,918
You know l didn't understand
anything you just said, right?

1592
01:16:53,989 --> 01:16:55,115
- l do know that.
- So what's the beauty?

1593
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:57,124
Every tenth line of code written,
they have to drink a shot.

1594
01:16:57,192 --> 01:17:00,184
Hacking's supposed to be stealth,
so every time the server detects an intrusion,

1595
01:17:00,296 --> 01:17:02,127
the candidate responsible
has to drink a shot.

1596
01:17:02,197 --> 01:17:03,926
l also have a program running
that has a pop-up window

1597
01:17:03,999 --> 01:17:05,830
appear simultaneously on all five computers.

1598
01:17:05,935 --> 01:17:07,926
The last candidate to hit the window
has to drink a shot.

1599
01:17:08,003 --> 01:17:10,130
Plus, every three minutes
they all have to drink a shot.

1600
01:17:10,205 --> 01:17:12,673
- Three minutes!
- Drink one now!

1601
01:17:12,775 --> 01:17:16,370
Hey, can l ask, what part of the intern's job
will they need to be able to do drunk?

1602
01:17:16,478 --> 01:17:17,502
You're right.

1603
01:17:17,613 --> 01:17:20,878
A more relevant test might be seeing
if they can keep a chicken alive for a week.

1604
01:17:22,685 --> 01:17:24,619
- That was mean.
- Here.

1605
01:17:24,787 --> 01:17:25,811
What is this?

1606
01:17:25,888 --> 01:17:28,982
l opened a new account
and put $18,000 in it.

1607
01:17:30,459 --> 01:17:32,324
Will that get you through the summer?

1608
01:17:32,394 --> 01:17:33,452
- Here!
- Mark?

1609
01:17:33,529 --> 01:17:34,962
Right here!

1610
01:17:40,135 --> 01:17:41,966
Welcome to Facebook.

1611
01:17:51,347 --> 01:17:53,042
- $18,000?
- Yes.

1612
01:17:53,148 --> 01:17:55,480
ln addition to the $1,000
you'd already put up.

1613
01:17:55,551 --> 01:17:58,145
- Yes.
- A total of $19,000 now.

1614
01:17:58,220 --> 01:17:59,482
- Yes.
- Hang on.

1615
01:18:01,657 --> 01:18:03,090
l'm just checking your math on that.

1616
01:18:03,192 --> 01:18:05,524
Yes, l got the same thing.

1617
01:18:06,095 --> 01:18:07,187
May l continue?

1618
01:18:07,763 --> 01:18:10,698
After expressing misgivings
about Mr. Zuckerberg taking the company

1619
01:18:10,766 --> 01:18:12,825
and moving it to California for the summer,

1620
01:18:12,901 --> 01:18:15,893
why did you put $18,000
in an account for his use?

1621
01:18:16,005 --> 01:18:19,736
l figured we were partners.
l wanted to be a team player.

1622
01:18:19,842 --> 01:18:22,902
l figured Mark, Dustin and the new interns
could work on the site

1623
01:18:23,012 --> 01:18:25,446
while l was generating
advertiser interest in New York.

1624
01:18:25,547 --> 01:18:30,075
But mostly l figured, how much could
possibly go wrong in three months?

1625
01:18:31,887 --> 01:18:33,684
Go, go, go, go, go.

1626
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:39,887
- l didn't die.
- l know.

1627
01:18:39,962 --> 01:18:41,793
- l made it.
- You did.

1628
01:18:43,232 --> 01:18:44,563
Okay, ready?

1629
01:18:44,633 --> 01:18:46,897
- That was like an 8.
- That was like a 2.

1630
01:18:46,969 --> 01:18:49,369
- lt was better than that.
- Yeah.

1631
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:59,071
l'm okay.

1632
01:18:59,148 --> 01:19:00,410
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1633
01:19:01,050 --> 01:19:02,108
Yikes.

1634
01:19:03,485 --> 01:19:04,884
That's the doorbell.

1635
01:19:04,953 --> 01:19:06,147
l didn't know we had a doorbell.

1636
01:19:06,255 --> 01:19:08,951
- Andrew, get the door!
- No, he's wired in.

1637
01:19:09,058 --> 01:19:11,049
That's gonna cut into your security deposit.

1638
01:19:13,128 --> 01:19:14,220
- Andrew.
- Not now.

1639
01:19:14,296 --> 01:19:15,627
Good boy.

1640
01:19:19,768 --> 01:19:21,099
- Sean?
- Mark?

1641
01:19:21,170 --> 01:19:23,138
- Do you live here?
- Yeah.

1642
01:19:23,439 --> 01:19:24,463
Do you?

1643
01:19:24,573 --> 01:19:26,097
We were right across the street.
We saw the chimney...

1644
01:19:26,175 --> 01:19:28,769
- ls anybody hurt?
- No. You live across the street?

1645
01:19:30,179 --> 01:19:31,373
l'm Sharon.

1646
01:19:31,447 --> 01:19:33,779
This is my... Sharon.
She lives across the street.

1647
01:19:33,882 --> 01:19:35,213
l was helping her move out,
we saw the chimney...

1648
01:19:35,284 --> 01:19:37,252
We had a zip line to the pool.

1649
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:40,588
You came to California.

1650
01:19:41,056 --> 01:19:42,080
Yeah.

1651
01:19:42,157 --> 01:19:44,284
You made the right choice.

1652
01:19:50,232 --> 01:19:51,256
Here you go.

1653
01:19:55,938 --> 01:19:56,962
Sharon?

1654
01:19:59,408 --> 01:20:00,432
l'm so sorry.

1655
01:20:00,509 --> 01:20:01,567
- No problem.
- l didn't know you were gonna...

1656
01:20:01,643 --> 01:20:03,668
- Here you go.
- No, no, no. Wait!

1657
01:20:05,114 --> 01:20:09,141
This house and this team are great.
lt's exactly what it should be.

1658
01:20:09,918 --> 01:20:11,283
l'm Sean Parker.

1659
01:20:11,353 --> 01:20:12,479
Oh, he's wired in.

1660
01:20:13,021 --> 01:20:14,682
That's what l'm talking about.

1661
01:20:16,258 --> 01:20:17,418
Where's Eduardo?

1662
01:20:17,493 --> 01:20:19,984
He got an internship in New York.

1663
01:20:20,662 --> 01:20:22,027
Eduardo didn't come out?

1664
01:20:42,651 --> 01:20:45,347
l was crashing there for a little bit
while l'm taking care of some things,

1665
01:20:45,454 --> 01:20:48,890
but she's done for the summer
so she's back at her parents' place.

1666
01:20:48,991 --> 01:20:52,449
- The homeless rock star of Palo Alto.
- All right.

1667
01:20:52,528 --> 01:20:54,962
What's your plan for the summer?

1668
01:20:56,165 --> 01:20:57,359
Mark?

1669
01:20:57,966 --> 01:21:00,161
l'm sorry. l was looking at the architecture.

1670
01:21:01,503 --> 01:21:02,834
l asked what your plan for the...

1671
01:21:02,905 --> 01:21:04,395
A hundred schools
by the end of the summer.

1672
01:21:04,506 --> 01:21:06,235
- We're gonna go to the restroom.
- Okay.

1673
01:21:06,375 --> 01:21:08,366
Yeah, l'll go with you.

1674
01:21:12,014 --> 01:21:13,504
Your date looks so familiar to me.

1675
01:21:13,582 --> 01:21:15,174
She looks familiar to a lot of people.

1676
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:16,478
What do you mean?

1677
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:21,887
A Stanford MBA named Roy Raymond
wants to buy his wife some lingerie,

1678
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:24,823
but he's too embarrassed
to shop for it in a department store.

1679
01:21:24,893 --> 01:21:26,724
He comes up with an idea
for a high-end place

1680
01:21:26,828 --> 01:21:29,160
that doesn't make you feel like a pervert.

1681
01:21:29,231 --> 01:21:33,224
He gets a $40,000 bank loan,
borrows another 40,000 from his in-laws,

1682
01:21:33,335 --> 01:21:36,327
opens a store and calls it Victoria's Secret.

1683
01:21:36,405 --> 01:21:39,101
Makes a half million dollars his first year.

1684
01:21:39,208 --> 01:21:43,042
Starts a catalog, opens three more stores,
and after five years, he sells the company

1685
01:21:43,111 --> 01:21:46,376
to Leslie Wexner and The Limited
for $4 million.

1686
01:21:46,515 --> 01:21:47,709
Happy ending, right?

1687
01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:52,516
Except two years later,
the company's worth $500 million,

1688
01:21:52,588 --> 01:21:55,887
and Roy Raymond jumps off
the Golden Gate Bridge.

1689
01:21:58,093 --> 01:22:01,859
Poor guy just wanted to buy his wife
a pair of thigh-highs, you know?

1690
01:22:03,065 --> 01:22:04,464
Was that a parable?

1691
01:22:05,267 --> 01:22:09,465
My date's a Victoria's Secret model.
That's why she looks familiar to you.

1692
01:22:09,571 --> 01:22:11,038
- God.
- Don't be impressed by all this.

1693
01:22:11,106 --> 01:22:12,368
l read your blog.

1694
01:22:12,441 --> 01:22:14,466
You know, no, that was for web cretins.

1695
01:22:14,576 --> 01:22:16,203
You know why l started Napster?

1696
01:22:17,379 --> 01:22:22,214
The girl l loved in high school was with
the co-captain of the varsity lacrosse team,

1697
01:22:22,284 --> 01:22:24,309
and l wanted to take her from him.

1698
01:22:24,419 --> 01:22:26,319
So l decided to come up with
the next big thing.

1699
01:22:26,722 --> 01:22:29,282
- l didn't know that.
- Napster wasn't a failure.

1700
01:22:29,424 --> 01:22:32,825
l changed the music industry
for better and for always.

1701
01:22:32,928 --> 01:22:37,160
lt may not have been good business,
but it pissed a lot of people off.

1702
01:22:37,266 --> 01:22:39,734
And isn't that what your Facemash
was about?

1703
01:22:39,801 --> 01:22:42,463
They're scared of me, pal,
and they're gonna be scared of you.

1704
01:22:42,571 --> 01:22:44,334
What the VCs want is to say,

1705
01:22:44,439 --> 01:22:47,272
"Good idea, kid,
the grown-ups will take it from here.''

1706
01:22:47,342 --> 01:22:49,970
But not this time. This is our time.

1707
01:22:50,445 --> 01:22:53,903
This time, you're gonna hand them
a business card that says,

1708
01:22:53,982 --> 01:22:55,677
"l'm CEO, bitch.''

1709
01:22:56,918 --> 01:22:58,749
That's what l want for you.

1710
01:22:59,488 --> 01:23:01,115
So where the hell is Eduardo?

1711
01:23:02,291 --> 01:23:04,759
- He's in New York.
- Sucking up to ad execs.

1712
01:23:04,826 --> 01:23:06,794
- He's got an...
- An internship.

1713
01:23:07,963 --> 01:23:11,455
The company's here.
A billion-dollar company's here.

1714
01:23:12,868 --> 01:23:14,426
- Do you live and breathe Facebook?
- Yes.

1715
01:23:14,503 --> 01:23:15,629
l know you do.

1716
01:23:15,704 --> 01:23:18,798
Wardo wants to be a businessman
and for all l know he's gonna be a good one,

1717
01:23:18,874 --> 01:23:21,638
but he shouldn't be in New York
kissing Madison Avenue's ass.

1718
01:23:23,645 --> 01:23:26,808
This is a once-in-a-generation,
"holy shit" idea.

1719
01:23:27,115 --> 01:23:30,778
And the water under
the Golden Gate is freezing cold.

1720
01:23:32,521 --> 01:23:36,651
Look at my face and tell me
l don't know what l'm talking about.

1721
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:39,884
Do you ever think about that girl?

1722
01:23:39,995 --> 01:23:41,019
What girl?

1723
01:23:41,129 --> 01:23:44,462
The girl from high school
with the lacrosse thing.

1724
01:23:45,801 --> 01:23:46,825
No.

1725
01:23:46,902 --> 01:23:50,463
lf you guys are gonna talk about bandwidth,
we need shots.

1726
01:23:50,539 --> 01:23:52,029
A hundred schools
by the end of the summer?

1727
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:53,164
Yeah.

1728
01:23:53,241 --> 01:23:54,640
Tell you what. Gesture of good faith.

1729
01:23:54,710 --> 01:23:59,170
While you're getting into 100 schools,
l'll put you on two continents.

1730
01:24:00,315 --> 01:24:01,407
Two...

1731
01:24:05,887 --> 01:24:07,354
lf you don't have a place to crash,

1732
01:24:07,422 --> 01:24:09,720
l think you should definitely
come and live with us.

1733
01:24:10,692 --> 01:24:12,592
Let's line up some shots.

1734
01:24:12,694 --> 01:24:14,821
- Excuse me!
- Yes, sir.

1735
01:24:14,896 --> 01:24:18,024
You can take this away
and bring back the 1942.

1736
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:20,034
Absolutely, Mr. Parker.

1737
01:24:36,184 --> 01:24:39,210
Attention... Go!

1738
01:24:56,071 --> 01:25:00,531
<i>At the barrier, Hollandia is</i>
<i>leading Harvard University by one length.</i>

1739
01:25:10,385 --> 01:25:11,579
<i>Approaching the grandstands,</i>

1740
01:25:11,653 --> 01:25:14,781
<i>Hollandia maintains a lead</i>
<i>of three-quarters of a length.</i>

1741
01:25:28,003 --> 01:25:29,231
Come on!

1742
01:26:07,943 --> 01:26:09,274
Whatever.

1743
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:16,008
- Mr. Winklevoss.
- Tyler.

1744
01:26:16,117 --> 01:26:17,982
- Tremendous race.
- Thank you.

1745
01:26:18,053 --> 01:26:20,317
- And this is my brother, Cameron.
- Excellent.

1746
01:26:20,388 --> 01:26:21,446
Sir?

1747
01:26:21,523 --> 01:26:23,218
His Royal Highness Prince Albert.

1748
01:26:23,325 --> 01:26:25,122
Your Highness, this is
Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

1749
01:26:25,193 --> 01:26:28,526
Of course. Brilliant race.
l've never seen a race that close.

1750
01:26:28,630 --> 01:26:29,654
Yes, Your Highness.

1751
01:26:29,731 --> 01:26:32,791
My grandfather, Jack Kelly,
was one of the premier rowers of his day.

1752
01:26:32,868 --> 01:26:36,304
l've been coming to Henley for 30 years
and l'd never seen a race that close.

1753
01:26:36,671 --> 01:26:38,332
Have you? Have you seen a race that close?

1754
01:26:38,406 --> 01:26:39,498
No, Your Highness.

1755
01:26:39,574 --> 01:26:41,974
Mile-and-a-half races are more
commonly won by a boat length or two.

1756
01:26:42,043 --> 01:26:44,807
Yes, that's absolutely right. Brutally close.

1757
01:26:45,046 --> 01:26:46,070
May l introduce my teammates?

1758
01:26:46,214 --> 01:26:48,148
l'm sorry. You'll have to excuse us.

1759
01:26:48,216 --> 01:26:49,877
On to the Dutch.

1760
01:26:53,355 --> 01:26:54,754
Sorry you flew all the way out here
to see that.

1761
01:26:54,856 --> 01:26:57,017
Wouldn't have missed it, brother.
How was the royalty?

1762
01:26:57,092 --> 01:26:59,720
l just wanted him to tell me
a couple more times how close the race was.

1763
01:26:59,828 --> 01:27:03,355
Just brutal, brutally close.
Brutally excruciating. Jesus.

1764
01:27:03,431 --> 01:27:05,092
The guy is the prince of a country
the size of Nantucket.

1765
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:06,224
Relax, it's fine.

1766
01:27:06,334 --> 01:27:07,528
- Boys. Divya.
- Dad.

1767
01:27:07,602 --> 01:27:09,661
- Mr. Winklevoss.
- That was a tough beat.

1768
01:27:09,738 --> 01:27:11,831
l'm sorry that you and Mom
had to fly out here to see that.

1769
01:27:11,907 --> 01:27:13,704
No, don't ever apologize to me
for losing a race like that.

1770
01:27:14,109 --> 01:27:16,737
Don't ever apologize to anyone
for losing a race like that.

1771
01:27:16,845 --> 01:27:18,676
- Boys.
- Mr. Kenwright.

1772
01:27:19,347 --> 01:27:22,043
Dad, this is Mr. Kenwright,
head of the host family for this week.

1773
01:27:22,117 --> 01:27:23,880
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

1774
01:27:23,952 --> 01:27:25,385
l've just had a phone chat with my daughter.

1775
01:27:25,453 --> 01:27:28,422
She told me that she and her friends
are already talking about the race,

1776
01:27:28,523 --> 01:27:30,787
which they've just seen via their computers.

1777
01:27:30,892 --> 01:27:34,726
A new website called Facebook.
Do you have this in America?

1778
01:27:36,064 --> 01:27:38,225
l'm gonna find your mother.

1779
01:27:39,801 --> 01:27:40,859
Have l said something wrong?

1780
01:27:40,936 --> 01:27:42,801
Your daughter doesn't go
to school in the States?

1781
01:27:42,904 --> 01:27:44,235
No, no. Cambridge.

1782
01:27:44,306 --> 01:27:47,070
Majoring in French literature, though
l wasn't aware there was such a thing.

1783
01:27:47,142 --> 01:27:48,234
And they have Facebook at Cambridge?

1784
01:27:48,310 --> 01:27:50,403
And apparently Oxford and
the London School of Economics.

1785
01:27:50,478 --> 01:27:51,536
That's where her friends are.

1786
01:27:52,147 --> 01:27:53,637
That's awesome.

1787
01:27:54,082 --> 01:27:57,609
Good race, boys.
Take the bitter with the better, eh?

1788
01:27:59,921 --> 01:28:01,320
l'm gonna go watch the race film.

1789
01:28:04,659 --> 01:28:06,957
lf this is online, l wanna see it.

1790
01:28:07,062 --> 01:28:08,393
Stop it.

1791
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:10,420
Stop it, Cam.

1792
01:28:10,832 --> 01:28:12,322
Knock it off.

1793
01:28:12,901 --> 01:28:15,461
l don't mind that we lost
to the Dutch today by less than a second.

1794
01:28:15,570 --> 01:28:17,765
That was a good race,
and that was a fair race.

1795
01:28:17,839 --> 01:28:19,306
And they'll see us again.

1796
01:28:19,407 --> 01:28:21,568
What l mind, and what you should mind,

1797
01:28:21,643 --> 01:28:24,806
is showing up on Monday
for a race that was run on Sunday.

1798
01:28:25,347 --> 01:28:27,281
We tried talking to him ourselves,
we tried writing a letter,

1799
01:28:27,349 --> 01:28:30,944
we tried the Ad Board, and we tried
talking to the president of the university.

1800
01:28:31,019 --> 01:28:33,510
Now, l am asking you for the last time,

1801
01:28:33,622 --> 01:28:38,821
let's take the considerable resources
at our disposal and sue him in federal court.

1802
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:40,522
Come on.

1803
01:28:41,930 --> 01:28:43,761
l need a real drink.

1804
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:51,663
Screw it.

1805
01:28:53,108 --> 01:28:55,338
Let's gut the friggin' nerd.

1806
01:28:58,146 --> 01:28:59,477
That's what l'm talking about!

1807
01:28:59,681 --> 01:29:01,512
No, no, no, no, no.

1808
01:29:01,650 --> 01:29:03,948
But check it out, l saw him today.

1809
01:29:04,019 --> 01:29:06,453
Manningham, Mitchell Manningham,
my Case Equity guy.

1810
01:29:06,521 --> 01:29:07,613
Hang on.

1811
01:29:07,689 --> 01:29:09,316
Are you guys using Spikes
or Ghost Missiles?

1812
01:29:09,424 --> 01:29:11,119
We don't know,
we're just shooting at each other.

1813
01:29:11,192 --> 01:29:12,591
Use Sweet Kamikazes.

1814
01:29:12,661 --> 01:29:14,788
Like we know what that is.

1815
01:29:15,296 --> 01:29:19,130
l saw him getting into his Turbo Carrera
and he saw me, too.

1816
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:20,758
l know he did.

1817
01:29:23,204 --> 01:29:26,139
Don't. Don't sweat it. l'm on a landline.

1818
01:29:26,307 --> 01:29:27,638
Bong hit.

1819
01:29:28,343 --> 01:29:29,833
Does anybody hear that banging?

1820
01:29:29,944 --> 01:29:32,344
You don't hear anything.
You're writing code.

1821
01:29:32,447 --> 01:29:34,438
Dude, somebody's at the door.

1822
01:29:34,516 --> 01:29:39,112
lt's not a dish best served cold.
lt's best served immediately and relentlessly.

1823
01:29:42,824 --> 01:29:44,655
l'm gonna call you back.

1824
01:29:46,661 --> 01:29:47,685
What's up?

1825
01:29:47,796 --> 01:29:49,161
What's up?

1826
01:29:50,865 --> 01:29:52,662
Mark was supposed to pick me up
at the airport an hour ago.

1827
01:29:52,734 --> 01:29:54,292
l've been calling his cell.

1828
01:29:54,369 --> 01:29:58,897
He was on a 36-hour coding tear,
so he took a nap for a couple of hours.

1829
01:30:05,146 --> 01:30:06,238
What happened here?

1830
01:30:06,347 --> 01:30:09,839
Not happened. Happening.
The next big thing.

1831
01:30:09,918 --> 01:30:11,044
Wardo.

1832
01:30:11,152 --> 01:30:12,176
Hey, man.

1833
01:30:12,253 --> 01:30:14,221
- Back to work.
- Okay.

1834
01:30:14,322 --> 01:30:17,257
The more bad l get at this,
the more wasted l get.

1835
01:30:17,358 --> 01:30:18,848
l mean the more wasted that l get...

1836
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:20,659
We understand.

1837
01:30:23,031 --> 01:30:24,157
How old are they, Sean?

1838
01:30:24,733 --> 01:30:26,064
lt's not polite to ask.

1839
01:30:26,167 --> 01:30:27,327
Sean, how old are they?

1840
01:30:28,603 --> 01:30:29,934
You think you know me, right?

1841
01:30:30,038 --> 01:30:31,266
l've read enough.

1842
01:30:31,372 --> 01:30:33,704
You know how much l've read about you?

1843
01:30:34,275 --> 01:30:35,572
Nothing.

1844
01:30:39,447 --> 01:30:41,210
- Wardo.
- Hey, man.

1845
01:30:41,282 --> 01:30:44,183
- l waited an hour for you at the airport.
- What time is it?

1846
01:30:44,252 --> 01:30:47,585
lt's midnight. Or 3:00 a.m. in New York,
where l just came from.

1847
01:30:47,689 --> 01:30:51,386
You gotta see some of the new stuff we got.
Hey, Dustin. Show him the Wall.

1848
01:30:51,459 --> 01:30:52,517
l'm just calling it the Wall.

1849
01:30:52,594 --> 01:30:55,222
Forget the Wall, tell him about
the meeting l've got set up.

1850
01:30:55,296 --> 01:30:56,888
You know Peter Thiel?

1851
01:30:56,965 --> 01:30:58,262
- Nope.
- No reason you should.

1852
01:30:58,366 --> 01:31:01,597
He just runs a $2-billion hedge fund
called Clarium Capital.

1853
01:31:03,104 --> 01:31:04,731
Why's he setting up meetings?

1854
01:31:04,806 --> 01:31:05,864
Thiel might wanna make
an angel investment.

1855
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:09,034
l don't care if he's an actual angel.
Why is he setting up business meetings?

1856
01:31:09,110 --> 01:31:11,772
- You've had a long flight.
- No, l had a long wait on the tarmac at JFK,

1857
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:14,144
then a long wait at the passenger
loading and unloading zone at SFO,

1858
01:31:14,249 --> 01:31:16,149
and in between there was a long flight.

1859
01:31:16,251 --> 01:31:17,980
l'm the business end of this company.

1860
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:21,154
And he is a houseguest living here rent free

1861
01:31:21,256 --> 01:31:24,157
on a very generous grant
from the Eduardo Saverin Foundation.

1862
01:31:24,259 --> 01:31:27,592
l heard about your big-ticket ad buys.
Gary's Tuxedos.

1863
01:31:27,662 --> 01:31:29,289
- Hey, man...
- Harvard Bartending Course.

1864
01:31:29,397 --> 01:31:32,594
You're just a small step away
from bagging Snookies Cookies, l can feel it.

1865
01:31:41,776 --> 01:31:44,074
- You wanna talk to me alone for a minute?
- Sure.

1866
01:31:48,416 --> 01:31:49,747
Bong hit.

1867
01:31:49,818 --> 01:31:52,116
- l'm so high.
- No, you're not.

1868
01:31:52,654 --> 01:31:54,417
So how's it going?

1869
01:31:54,756 --> 01:31:57,418
How's the internship? How's Christy?

1870
01:31:58,426 --> 01:32:00,758
- How's the internship?
- Yeah.

1871
01:32:02,297 --> 01:32:04,288
Mark, Jesus, l quit the internship.

1872
01:32:04,365 --> 01:32:06,833
We talked about this on the phone.
l quit on my first day.

1873
01:32:08,469 --> 01:32:10,835
l do remember you saying that.

1874
01:32:11,039 --> 01:32:12,802
So how is Christy?

1875
01:32:13,208 --> 01:32:14,869
Christy's crazy.

1876
01:32:15,143 --> 01:32:16,838
- ls that fun?
- No.

1877
01:32:16,945 --> 01:32:17,969
l mean, she's actually psychotic.

1878
01:32:18,046 --> 01:32:23,211
She's insanely jealous, she's irrational,
and l'm frightened of her.

1879
01:32:23,852 --> 01:32:25,149
Still, it's nice you have a girlfriend.

1880
01:32:28,690 --> 01:32:32,786
l do not want that guy representing
himself as part of this company.

1881
01:32:32,861 --> 01:32:35,022
You gotta move out here, Wardo,
this is where it's all happening.

1882
01:32:35,129 --> 01:32:37,120
- Did you hear what l just said?
- The connections, the energy...

1883
01:32:37,198 --> 01:32:38,222
Mark, you got...

1884
01:32:38,333 --> 01:32:40,858
l'm afraid if you don't come out here,
you're gonna get left behind.

1885
01:32:40,969 --> 01:32:43,301
l want... l need you out here.

1886
01:32:43,371 --> 01:32:45,339
- Please don't tell him l said that.
- What did you just say?

1887
01:32:45,406 --> 01:32:47,465
lt's moving faster than any of us
ever imagined it would.

1888
01:32:47,542 --> 01:32:49,305
- lt's moving fast.
- What did you mean?

1889
01:32:49,377 --> 01:32:51,345
- And Sean thinks we have...
- Sean is not part of this company.

1890
01:32:51,412 --> 01:32:52,470
We have over 300,000 members, Wardo,

1891
01:32:52,547 --> 01:32:54,708
and we're in 160 schools,
including five in Europe.

1892
01:32:54,816 --> 01:32:56,340
l'm aware of that! Mark, l am the CFO!

1893
01:32:56,417 --> 01:32:57,850
We need more servers
than l ever expected we'd need.

1894
01:32:57,919 --> 01:32:59,477
We need more programmers
and we need more money,

1895
01:32:59,554 --> 01:33:02,079
and he set up the Thiel meeting.
He set up meetings all over town.

1896
01:33:02,190 --> 01:33:03,384
- He set up other meetings?
- Yes.

1897
01:33:03,491 --> 01:33:05,254
- Without me knowing anything about it.
- You're in New York.

1898
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:09,262
l'm in New York riding subways
14 hours a day, trying to find advertisers!

1899
01:33:09,364 --> 01:33:11,025
And how's it going so far?

1900
01:33:15,503 --> 01:33:18,239
What did you mean, "get left behind"?

1901
01:33:22,710 --> 01:33:24,075
- Hi.
- Can l help you?

1902
01:33:24,178 --> 01:33:25,668
l'd like to freeze this bank account

1903
01:33:25,747 --> 01:33:29,205
and cancel all existing checks
and lines of credit.

1904
01:33:30,551 --> 01:33:33,714
- May l see some lD, please?
- Yeah, sure, sorry.

1905
01:33:40,528 --> 01:33:41,756
Sean, he'll be right with you.

1906
01:33:41,863 --> 01:33:43,262
No problem.

1907
01:33:45,099 --> 01:33:47,363
You know this is where
they filmed <i>Towering lnferno?</i>

1908
01:33:47,435 --> 01:33:49,198
That's comforting.

1909
01:33:50,605 --> 01:33:52,368
Hey, guys. Come on back.

1910
01:33:53,875 --> 01:33:56,105
- She offer you some waters?
- Oh, yeah. We're cool.

1911
01:33:57,712 --> 01:33:58,940
Sean, how are you? Come on in.

1912
01:33:59,047 --> 01:34:00,947
- You must be Mark.
- Hi.

1913
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:06,083
We took a look at everything,
and congratulations.

1914
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:09,712
We're gonna start you off
with a $500,000 investment.

1915
01:34:10,158 --> 01:34:13,821
Maurice is gonna talk to you
about some corporate restructuring.

1916
01:34:13,928 --> 01:34:15,953
We'll file as a corporation in Delaware

1917
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:18,965
and come up with a stock structure
that allows for new investors.

1918
01:34:19,067 --> 01:34:21,399
Now, let me ask you something.

1919
01:34:21,569 --> 01:34:23,503
Who's Eduardo Saverin?

1920
01:34:43,858 --> 01:34:45,086
Jesus Christ.

1921
01:34:48,663 --> 01:34:49,789
When did you get back?

1922
01:34:49,864 --> 01:34:51,263
You scared me. l need you to knock.

1923
01:34:51,332 --> 01:34:53,266
When did you get back?

1924
01:34:54,369 --> 01:34:56,030
l got back this afternoon.

1925
01:34:56,137 --> 01:34:57,604
And when were you gonna call me?

1926
01:34:57,672 --> 01:35:00,334
Chris, it was kind of a rough trip
and l was tired...

1927
01:35:00,441 --> 01:35:04,343
Yeah, or answer one of my 47 texts.
Did you know l sent 47 texts?

1928
01:35:04,445 --> 01:35:08,313
l did, and l thought that was
incredibly normal behavior.

1929
01:35:08,449 --> 01:35:09,939
Are you mocking me?

1930
01:35:10,151 --> 01:35:11,379
l brought you a present.

1931
01:35:13,187 --> 01:35:16,054
Why does your Status say "single"
on your Facebook page?

1932
01:35:16,157 --> 01:35:17,181
What?

1933
01:35:17,291 --> 01:35:21,193
Why does your Relationship Status
say "single" on your Facebook page?

1934
01:35:21,295 --> 01:35:22,956
Well, l was single when l set up the page.

1935
01:35:23,031 --> 01:35:25,158
And you just never bothered to change it?

1936
01:35:25,233 --> 01:35:26,291
What?

1937
01:35:26,501 --> 01:35:27,991
l don't know how.

1938
01:35:28,069 --> 01:35:29,900
Do l look stupid to you?

1939
01:35:30,004 --> 01:35:31,301
No, calm down.

1940
01:35:31,372 --> 01:35:33,636
You're asking me to believe
that the CFO of Facebook

1941
01:35:33,708 --> 01:35:36,006
doesn't know how to change
his Relationship Status on Facebook?

1942
01:35:36,077 --> 01:35:39,410
lt's embarrassing, so you should take it
as a sign of trust that l would tell you that.

1943
01:35:39,514 --> 01:35:40,742
- Go to hell.
- Take it easy.

1944
01:35:40,848 --> 01:35:43,874
No, you didn't change it so you could
screw those Silicon Valley sluts

1945
01:35:43,985 --> 01:35:45,179
every time you go out to see Mark.

1946
01:35:45,253 --> 01:35:48,245
Not even remotely true, and l can
promise you that the Silicon Valley sluts

1947
01:35:48,356 --> 01:35:51,257
don't care what anyone's
Relationship Status is on Facebook.

1948
01:35:51,359 --> 01:35:52,758
Please, open your present.

1949
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:54,725
Your phone does work.

1950
01:35:55,696 --> 01:35:56,822
lt's Mark.

1951
01:35:56,898 --> 01:35:59,059
Okay, this is gonna be tricky.

1952
01:35:59,167 --> 01:36:01,692
Open your present. lt's a silk scarf.

1953
01:36:01,769 --> 01:36:03,396
Have you ever seen me wear a scarf?

1954
01:36:03,838 --> 01:36:05,669
This'll be your first.

1955
01:36:05,773 --> 01:36:06,831
Yeah.

1956
01:36:06,908 --> 01:36:08,205
<i>- You froze our account?</i>
- l did.

1957
01:36:08,276 --> 01:36:10,506
- You froze the account.
- l had to get your attention, Mark.

1958
01:36:10,578 --> 01:36:12,341
Do you realize that you jeopardized
the entire company?

1959
01:36:12,413 --> 01:36:14,005
Do you realize that your actions
could have destroyed

1960
01:36:14,082 --> 01:36:15,106
everything l've been working on?

1961
01:36:15,216 --> 01:36:16,240
We have been working on.

1962
01:36:16,350 --> 01:36:17,874
Without money, the site can't function.

1963
01:36:17,952 --> 01:36:20,182
Let me tell you the difference
between Facebook and everybody else.

1964
01:36:20,254 --> 01:36:21,380
We don't crash ever!

1965
01:36:21,456 --> 01:36:25,085
lf the servers are down for even a day, our
entire reputation is irreversibly destroyed.

1966
01:36:25,193 --> 01:36:27,184
- Look...
<i>- Users are fickle. Friendster has proved that.</i>

1967
01:36:27,261 --> 01:36:30,059
<i>Even a few people leaving would reverberate</i>
<i>through the entire user base.</i>

1968
01:36:30,131 --> 01:36:32,429
The users are interconnected.
That is the whole point.

1969
01:36:32,533 --> 01:36:34,262
College kids are online
because their friends are online

1970
01:36:34,368 --> 01:36:36,563
and if one domino goes,
the other dominos go.

1971
01:36:36,637 --> 01:36:37,695
Don't you get that?

1972
01:36:37,772 --> 01:36:39,399
l am not going back to
the Caribbean Night at A-E-Pi!

1973
01:36:41,409 --> 01:36:42,774
Holy shit.

1974
01:36:45,613 --> 01:36:46,978
What is wrong with you?

1975
01:36:47,081 --> 01:36:48,548
Did you like being nobody?

1976
01:36:48,616 --> 01:36:50,413
Did you like being a joke?
Do you wanna go back to that?

1977
01:36:50,485 --> 01:36:51,918
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.

1978
01:36:51,986 --> 01:36:53,283
<i>That was the act of a child,</i>
<i>not a businessman,</i>

1979
01:36:53,387 --> 01:36:54,820
<i>and it certainly was not the act of a friend.</i>

1980
01:36:54,922 --> 01:36:57,447
You know how embarrassing it was for me
to try to cash a check today?

1981
01:36:57,558 --> 01:36:58,820
l am not going back to that life.

1982
01:36:58,926 --> 01:37:01,326
<i>- Maybe you were frustrated.</i>
- Yeah!

1983
01:37:01,462 --> 01:37:03,760
- Maybe you were angry.
- l was!

1984
01:37:03,965 --> 01:37:06,331
But l am willing to let bygones be bygones,

1985
01:37:06,434 --> 01:37:08,766
<i>because, Wardo, l've got some good news.</i>

1986
01:37:08,836 --> 01:37:09,962
l'm sorry.

1987
01:37:10,071 --> 01:37:14,838
l was angry, and maybe it was childish,
but l had to get your attention.

1988
01:37:14,942 --> 01:37:17,740
Wardo, l said l've got some good news.

1989
01:37:18,146 --> 01:37:19,170
What is it?

1990
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:21,805
Peter Thiel just made an angel investment
of half a million dollars.

1991
01:37:21,916 --> 01:37:23,076
What?

1992
01:37:23,284 --> 01:37:27,243
<i>Half a million dollars.</i>
<i>And he's setting us up in an office.</i>

1993
01:37:27,989 --> 01:37:30,514
They wanna reincorporate the company.
They wanna meet you.

1994
01:37:30,625 --> 01:37:32,092
They need your signature
on some documents,

1995
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:34,628
so you gotta get your ass
on the first flight back to San Francisco.

1996
01:37:34,695 --> 01:37:36,253
<i>l need my CFO.</i>

1997
01:37:41,202 --> 01:37:42,260
l'm on my way.

1998
01:37:42,336 --> 01:37:43,826
<i>- Wardo?</i>
- Yeah?

1999
01:37:44,038 --> 01:37:45,471
We did it.

2000
01:37:48,809 --> 01:37:50,003
Wardo?

2001
01:37:50,611 --> 01:37:52,545
You're going back there already?

2002
01:37:52,647 --> 01:37:53,773
Yes.

2003
01:37:55,550 --> 01:37:57,711
And also, l'm breaking up with you.

2004
01:38:01,556 --> 01:38:03,319
Somebody stop her!

2005
01:38:05,826 --> 01:38:06,884
Four documents.

2006
01:38:06,994 --> 01:38:08,894
The first two are common stock
purchase agreements,

2007
01:38:08,996 --> 01:38:12,022
allowing you to buy stock
in the newly reincorporated Facebook,

2008
01:38:12,133 --> 01:38:15,534
as opposed to the old shares,
which are now worthless.

2009
01:38:15,636 --> 01:38:16,796
The third is an exchange agreement

2010
01:38:16,871 --> 01:38:19,669
allowing you to exchange
the old shares for new shares,

2011
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:21,970
and then finally a voter holding agreement.

2012
01:38:22,043 --> 01:38:23,806
How many shares of stock will l own?

2013
01:38:23,878 --> 01:38:27,041
1,328,334.

2014
01:38:27,148 --> 01:38:28,513
Jesus Christ.

2015
01:38:28,616 --> 01:38:31,517
That represents a 34.4 % ownership share.

2016
01:38:32,019 --> 01:38:34,351
Why the increase from the original 30 %?

2017
01:38:34,455 --> 01:38:37,185
'Cause you may need to dilute it
to award shares to new investors.

2018
01:38:37,892 --> 01:38:40,156
- l love working with business majors.
- l'm telling you.

2019
01:38:40,228 --> 01:38:41,286
- Economics.
- Right.

2020
01:38:41,362 --> 01:38:46,299
You should know that Mark has already
taken his percentage from 60 down to 51.

2021
01:38:47,568 --> 01:38:50,833
Well, Mark doesn't care about money
and he needs to be protected.

2022
01:38:52,873 --> 01:38:55,205
Dustin Moskovitz owns 6.81 %.

2023
01:38:55,309 --> 01:38:58,142
Sean Parker, 6.47 %.

2024
01:39:00,381 --> 01:39:01,405
l can live with that.

2025
01:39:01,515 --> 01:39:03,346
And Peter Thiel, 7 %.

2026
01:39:07,722 --> 01:39:10,020
Would you like to use my pen?

2027
01:39:10,258 --> 01:39:13,227
Eduardo? Eduardo?

2028
01:39:14,996 --> 01:39:16,088
Can you please repeat the question?

2029
01:39:16,197 --> 01:39:18,392
No, it was an outrageously leading question
the first time around,

2030
01:39:18,499 --> 01:39:19,591
and now you want us to hear it twice?

2031
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:21,565
Yes. Would you read it back, please?

2032
01:39:21,669 --> 01:39:22,693
Well, go ahead.

2033
01:39:22,770 --> 01:39:24,499
"Counsel: 'And when you signed
these documents,

2034
01:39:24,572 --> 01:39:27,336
"'were you aware that you were signing
your own death certificate?"'

2035
01:39:27,408 --> 01:39:28,500
No.

2036
01:39:32,913 --> 01:39:37,043
lt was insanely stupid of me not to have
my own lawyers look over all the...

2037
01:39:37,118 --> 01:39:40,281
ln all honesty,
l thought they were my lawyers.

2038
01:39:43,557 --> 01:39:45,115
l was your only friend.

2039
01:39:47,061 --> 01:39:48,392
You had one friend.

2040
01:39:53,234 --> 01:39:54,258
My father won't even look at me.

2041
01:39:54,368 --> 01:39:59,431
Okay, Eduardo, did Mr. Zuckerberg say
anything to you after you signed the papers?

2042
01:39:59,573 --> 01:40:02,565
There was a lot of handshaking,
a lot of congratulations.

2043
01:40:03,744 --> 01:40:05,109
He'd already told me that he wouldn't be

2044
01:40:05,212 --> 01:40:08,306
coming back to school
for at least a semester,

2045
01:40:08,416 --> 01:40:11,146
so we were saying goodbye for a while.

2046
01:40:11,952 --> 01:40:13,214
And then before l left he said...

2047
01:40:13,287 --> 01:40:14,379
But you gotta come back.

2048
01:40:14,455 --> 01:40:16,946
Somewhere around the end of November
or early December.

2049
01:40:17,058 --> 01:40:19,492
Peter wants to throw us an amazing party
when we hit a million members.

2050
01:40:19,593 --> 01:40:21,322
lt's gonna be out of control.
You gotta come back for it.

2051
01:40:21,429 --> 01:40:22,726
A million members?

2052
01:40:22,797 --> 01:40:23,957
Yeah.

2053
01:40:24,465 --> 01:40:27,764
Remember the algorithm
on the window at Kirkland?

2054
01:40:28,669 --> 01:40:29,897
Yeah.

2055
01:40:33,307 --> 01:40:34,569
Yeah, l'll be here.

2056
01:40:39,747 --> 01:40:40,907
You sure about this?

2057
01:40:40,981 --> 01:40:42,141
You're 20 minutes late.

2058
01:40:42,249 --> 01:40:43,682
You're gonna walk in there
and say you overslept

2059
01:40:43,784 --> 01:40:44,910
and didn't have time to get dressed.

2060
01:40:44,985 --> 01:40:47,146
They're gonna pitch you.
Case Equity is going to pitch you.

2061
01:40:47,254 --> 01:40:48,812
They're gonna beg you to take their money.

2062
01:40:48,923 --> 01:40:50,584
You're gonna nod, you're gonna nod,
you're gonna nod,

2063
01:40:50,658 --> 01:40:53,684
and then you're gonna say,
"Which one of you is Roth?"

2064
01:40:53,794 --> 01:40:55,193
No, not Roth. Manningham.

2065
01:40:55,296 --> 01:40:57,423
"Which one of you is Mitchell Manningham?"
And he'll say, "l am.''

2066
01:40:57,498 --> 01:41:00,956
And then you say,
"Sean Parker says, 'Fuck you.'"

2067
01:41:01,502 --> 01:41:02,833
Walk out.

2068
01:41:02,970 --> 01:41:04,130
Okay.

2069
01:41:16,984 --> 01:41:19,111
ln late November, l got the e-mail from Mark

2070
01:41:19,186 --> 01:41:21,211
telling me to come out
for the millionth-member party.

2071
01:41:21,322 --> 01:41:22,346
What else did the e-mail say?

2072
01:41:22,957 --> 01:41:25,118
lt said that we had to have
a business meeting.

2073
01:41:25,993 --> 01:41:29,224
That Mark and Sean had played
some kind of revenge stunt on Case Equity,

2074
01:41:29,897 --> 01:41:31,524
<i>and that Manningham was so impressed</i>

2075
01:41:31,632 --> 01:41:35,534
<i>that he was now making an investment offer</i>
<i>that was hard to turn down.</i>

2076
01:41:35,636 --> 01:41:39,800
<i>So l went to California,</i>
<i>and l went straight to the new offices.</i>

2077
01:41:39,874 --> 01:41:43,571
<i>l didn't know whether to dress for the party</i>
<i>or for the business meeting,</i>

2078
01:41:43,677 --> 01:41:46,043
<i>so l kind of dressed for both.</i>

2079
01:41:46,747 --> 01:41:48,715
<i>- But it didn't matter.</i>
<i>- Why not?</i>

2080
01:41:48,816 --> 01:41:51,011
<i>Because l wasn't called out there</i>
<i>for either one.</i>

2081
01:41:51,085 --> 01:41:52,677
What were you called out there for?

2082
01:41:56,524 --> 01:41:57,889
An ambush.

2083
01:41:58,325 --> 01:42:00,156
Mr. Saverin. Hey. Right over here.

2084
01:42:07,268 --> 01:42:08,326
Hey, man.

2085
01:42:08,402 --> 01:42:09,426
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

2086
01:42:09,537 --> 01:42:12,233
- Good, good, good, good, good.
- Good to see you.

2087
01:42:12,339 --> 01:42:15,775
At first l thought he was joking.
Giving me more contracts to sign.

2088
01:42:20,181 --> 01:42:21,944
But then l started reading.

2089
01:42:25,352 --> 01:42:27,115
Wait, what is this?

2090
01:42:27,455 --> 01:42:30,720
Well, as you know, we had some
new investors that have come in.

2091
01:42:30,858 --> 01:42:31,882
What is this?

2092
01:42:44,205 --> 01:42:45,638
Mr. Saverin.

2093
01:42:48,275 --> 01:42:49,435
Mark!

2094
01:42:50,744 --> 01:42:52,211
- Mark?
- He's wired in.

2095
01:42:52,279 --> 01:42:53,303
- Sorry?
- He's wired in.

2096
01:42:53,414 --> 01:42:54,881
- ls he?
- Yes.

2097
01:42:56,450 --> 01:42:59,214
- How about now? Are you still wired in?
- Call security.

2098
01:42:59,286 --> 01:43:01,117
You issued 24 million new shares of stock!

2099
01:43:02,323 --> 01:43:03,950
You were told that if new investors
came along...

2100
01:43:04,058 --> 01:43:07,152
How much were your shares diluted?
How much were his?

2101
01:43:07,261 --> 01:43:10,992
What was Mr. Zuckerberg's
ownership share diluted down to?

2102
01:43:11,332 --> 01:43:12,390
lt wasn't.

2103
01:43:12,466 --> 01:43:16,095
What was Mr. Moskovitz's ownership share
diluted down to?

2104
01:43:16,170 --> 01:43:17,501
lt wasn't.

2105
01:43:17,605 --> 01:43:20,506
What was Sean Parker's ownership share
diluted down to?

2106
01:43:20,608 --> 01:43:21,632
lt wasn't.

2107
01:43:21,742 --> 01:43:24,404
What was Peter Thiel's ownership share
diluted down to?

2108
01:43:24,478 --> 01:43:25,570
lt wasn't.

2109
01:43:25,646 --> 01:43:28,638
And what was your ownership share
diluted down to?

2110
01:43:29,650 --> 01:43:32,312
.03 %

2111
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:42,458
- You signed the papers.
- You set me up.

2112
01:43:42,530 --> 01:43:45,090
You're gonna blame me because you were
the business head of the company,

2113
01:43:45,165 --> 01:43:47,030
and you made a bad business deal
with your own company?

2114
01:43:47,134 --> 01:43:48,761
lt's gonna be like l'm not a part of Facebook.

2115
01:43:48,836 --> 01:43:50,167
lt won't be like
you're not a part of Facebook.

2116
01:43:50,271 --> 01:43:51,295
You're not a part of Facebook.

2117
01:43:51,372 --> 01:43:53,772
- My name's on the masthead.
- You might wanna check again.

2118
01:43:53,841 --> 01:43:55,172
This because l froze the account?

2119
01:43:55,276 --> 01:43:57,437
You think we'd let you
parade around in your ridiculous suits,

2120
01:43:57,511 --> 01:43:58,535
pretending you were running this company?

2121
01:43:58,646 --> 01:44:00,978
Sorry, my Prada's at the cleaner's!

2122
01:44:01,048 --> 01:44:05,451
Along with my hoodie and my fuck-you
flip-flops, you pretentious douchebag!

2123
01:44:05,519 --> 01:44:07,180
Security's here. You'll be leaving now.

2124
01:44:07,288 --> 01:44:10,189
- l'm not signing those papers.
- We will get the signature.

2125
01:44:10,291 --> 01:44:12,384
Tell me this isn't about me
getting into the Phoenix.

2126
01:44:15,062 --> 01:44:19,294
You... You did it. l knew you did it.
You planted that story about the chicken!

2127
01:44:19,366 --> 01:44:21,493
- l didn't plant that story.
- What's he talking about?

2128
01:44:21,569 --> 01:44:24,538
- You had me accused of animal cruelty.
- Seriously. What the hell's the chicken?

2129
01:44:24,638 --> 01:44:26,333
And l'll bet what you hated the most

2130
01:44:26,407 --> 01:44:29,843
is that they identified me
as a co-founder of Facebook.

2131
01:44:30,311 --> 01:44:33,144
Which l am. You better lawyer up, asshole.

2132
01:44:33,213 --> 01:44:37,741
'Cause l'm not coming back for 30 %.
l'm coming back for everything.

2133
01:44:44,224 --> 01:44:47,193
- Get him out of here.
- lt's okay, l'm going.

2134
01:44:49,163 --> 01:44:50,425
Hang on.

2135
01:44:52,666 --> 01:44:54,224
Almost forgot.

2136
01:44:55,269 --> 01:44:57,567
Here's your $19,000.
l wouldn't cash it, though.

2137
01:44:57,671 --> 01:44:59,195
l drew it on the account you froze.

2138
01:45:04,511 --> 01:45:07,036
l like standing next to you, Sean.

2139
01:45:08,282 --> 01:45:10,409
lt makes me look so tough.

2140
01:45:23,564 --> 01:45:24,861
Well...

2141
01:45:25,299 --> 01:45:28,234
That's it, that's our show for tonight, people.

2142
01:45:28,302 --> 01:45:30,600
And look, l wanna see everyone here
geared up for a party.

2143
01:45:30,704 --> 01:45:32,763
We're gonna walk into that club
like it's the Macy's Parade.

2144
01:45:32,873 --> 01:45:35,967
Mackey, put it up on the big screen.
We've gotta almost be there.

2145
01:45:39,246 --> 01:45:41,111
- You all right?
- Yeah.

2146
01:45:42,383 --> 01:45:43,816
You were kind of rough on him.

2147
01:45:43,917 --> 01:45:45,908
That's life in the NFL.

2148
01:45:46,120 --> 01:45:47,747
You know you didn't have to be
that rough on him.

2149
01:45:47,821 --> 01:45:49,982
- Listen, l put him...
- Sean!

2150
01:45:51,291 --> 01:45:53,384
You didn't have to be that rough on him.

2151
01:45:53,460 --> 01:45:54,654
He almost killed it.

2152
01:45:57,431 --> 01:45:58,625
l'll send flowers.

2153
01:46:00,334 --> 01:46:05,067
Speaking of flowers, l'm putting together
a party after the party at Kappa Eta Sigma.

2154
01:46:05,139 --> 01:46:06,401
Ashleigh's a sister.

2155
01:46:06,473 --> 01:46:07,997
- Ashleigh?
- The intern.

2156
01:46:08,108 --> 01:46:11,271
Yeah. l know who she is. Are you guys...

2157
01:46:11,912 --> 01:46:13,573
Ashleigh? Me? No.

2158
01:46:13,647 --> 01:46:15,114
Well, a little bit.

2159
01:46:15,983 --> 01:46:17,007
Why?

2160
01:46:17,117 --> 01:46:18,948
- No. Nothing, l just...
- Excuse me. Mark?

2161
01:46:19,019 --> 01:46:22,284
- We were just talking about you.
- Just that you're doing a really good job.

2162
01:46:22,956 --> 01:46:25,117
Thanks. l appreciate that.

2163
01:46:26,126 --> 01:46:27,184
These came in for you.

2164
01:46:27,294 --> 01:46:29,091
Put them on my desk.

2165
01:46:36,036 --> 01:46:37,469
What's the package?

2166
01:46:38,338 --> 01:46:39,362
Nothing.

2167
01:46:41,809 --> 01:46:43,299
- Mackey.
- Yes, sir.

2168
01:46:43,377 --> 01:46:44,674
Refresh.

2169
01:46:45,179 --> 01:46:46,373
Sweet!

2170
01:46:52,386 --> 01:46:54,445
And you're not a hugger.

2171
01:46:54,722 --> 01:46:56,019
l know.

2172
01:46:58,659 --> 01:47:00,126
One million!

2173
01:47:01,695 --> 01:47:04,459
Who's got champagne? Huh?

2174
01:47:05,799 --> 01:47:07,562
l've got champagne.

2175
01:47:27,421 --> 01:47:31,016
The next transformative development,
a picture-sharing application.

2176
01:47:31,091 --> 01:47:34,185
A place where you view pictures
that coincide with your social life.

2177
01:47:34,261 --> 01:47:37,253
lt is the true digitalization of real life.

2178
01:47:37,364 --> 01:47:39,832
- You can use a CD.
- You can do it off of me.

2179
01:47:39,900 --> 01:47:41,595
You don't just go to a party anymore.

2180
01:47:41,702 --> 01:47:45,433
You go to a party with a digital camera,
and then your friends relive the party online.

2181
01:47:45,539 --> 01:47:46,904
And tagging. The idea...

2182
01:47:47,007 --> 01:47:50,204
- Would this be easier without the bra?
- lt's worth finding out.

2183
01:47:57,985 --> 01:48:00,351
All right, shut the music down!

2184
01:48:00,721 --> 01:48:02,348
The party's over!

2185
01:48:02,422 --> 01:48:04,219
Everybody, go home!

2186
01:48:04,725 --> 01:48:07,193
l've spent hours watching
what people do when they log on.

2187
01:48:07,261 --> 01:48:08,660
How they check their friends' status updates.

2188
01:48:08,729 --> 01:48:10,219
Wait. That's weird. Why did the music stop?

2189
01:48:10,330 --> 01:48:11,490
Check to see which one of their friends

2190
01:48:11,565 --> 01:48:13,499
changed their profiles,
changed their photos...

2191
01:48:13,567 --> 01:48:15,159
Seriously, what happened to the music?

2192
01:48:15,235 --> 01:48:17,203
We lived on farms
and then we lived in cities,

2193
01:48:17,271 --> 01:48:19,239
and now we're going to live on the lnternet!

2194
01:48:19,339 --> 01:48:23,002
Sean, stop.
l think something's going on downstairs.

2195
01:48:32,052 --> 01:48:34,850
Ladies and gentlemen,
can l have your attention, please?

2196
01:48:34,922 --> 01:48:38,187
lt's time for you to go home.
The party is over.

2197
01:48:38,525 --> 01:48:40,356
Then it's all good.

2198
01:48:42,095 --> 01:48:43,187
- lt's the cops.
- What?

2199
01:48:43,263 --> 01:48:44,287
Shit! Shit.

2200
01:48:44,398 --> 01:48:48,129
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
- Okay, it's okay. Be cool.

2201
01:48:48,702 --> 01:48:50,863
Good to see you, Officer.
What can l do for you?

2202
01:48:52,072 --> 01:48:53,096
What's going on?

2203
01:48:53,207 --> 01:48:55,767
Was the music too loud?
We were having a celebration.

2204
01:48:55,876 --> 01:48:57,400
Miss, l need you to button your blouse.

2205
01:48:57,477 --> 01:49:00,275
l can tell them to turn the music down.

2206
01:49:04,218 --> 01:49:05,242
That's not mine.

2207
01:49:05,652 --> 01:49:08,644
Okay, we're gonna need identification.
Keep your hands where we can see them.

2208
01:49:08,755 --> 01:49:10,154
Oh, my God.

2209
01:49:10,257 --> 01:49:11,952
You got anything else in your pockets
l should know about?

2210
01:49:12,059 --> 01:49:13,083
No, sir. No.

2211
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:15,424
- Don't be stupid, now.
- l don't, l don't.

2212
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:21,990
What's this?

2213
01:49:22,236 --> 01:49:23,931
That's an EpiPen.

2214
01:49:25,005 --> 01:49:27,337
- And this?
- That's my inhaler.

2215
01:49:28,175 --> 01:49:29,836
How old are you?

2216
01:49:30,444 --> 01:49:31,843
Twenty-one.

2217
01:49:32,312 --> 01:49:33,336
Twenty-one.

2218
01:49:33,447 --> 01:49:34,846
- Twenty-one.
- l'm 21.

2219
01:49:34,948 --> 01:49:36,609
Lying only makes it worse.

2220
01:49:37,985 --> 01:49:40,476
l'm sorry, l shouldn't have lied.

2221
01:49:51,498 --> 01:49:52,522
Hello.

2222
01:49:52,633 --> 01:49:55,124
Listen, something's happened.

2223
01:50:02,442 --> 01:50:03,466
Shit.

2224
01:50:03,543 --> 01:50:05,477
No, it's all right. lt's gonna be all right.

2225
01:50:05,545 --> 01:50:09,538
l posted bond, and l wasn't doing anything.
l mean, l've got allergies.

2226
01:50:14,354 --> 01:50:15,378
lnterns.

2227
01:50:15,489 --> 01:50:17,320
lt was just a party.

2228
01:50:20,127 --> 01:50:23,494
This is gonna be news, Sean.
lt's gonna be online any second.

2229
01:50:24,698 --> 01:50:25,722
l know.

2230
01:50:25,832 --> 01:50:27,493
You know with an intern...

2231
01:50:27,567 --> 01:50:29,728
No, it's cool. l have it under control.

2232
01:50:29,836 --> 01:50:31,394
l will get it under control.

2233
01:50:31,538 --> 01:50:33,870
l will call someone
and see what the next move is.

2234
01:50:33,974 --> 01:50:35,498
But this is gonna be news now.

2235
01:50:36,243 --> 01:50:38,734
You don't think Wardo
was involved, do you?

2236
01:50:38,845 --> 01:50:39,869
l mean, do you think...

2237
01:50:39,980 --> 01:50:41,038
No.

2238
01:50:41,248 --> 01:50:43,148
Or Manningham. One of them.

2239
01:50:43,216 --> 01:50:46,481
Somebody. Somebody sent the coke
in there, because it got in there.

2240
01:50:46,553 --> 01:50:48,384
You believe me. God, this is gonna be fine.

2241
01:50:53,226 --> 01:50:54,420
Right?

2242
01:50:57,197 --> 01:50:58,755
Go home, Sean.

2243
01:51:14,047 --> 01:51:15,241
<i>Mark?</i>

2244
01:51:17,117 --> 01:51:18,175
<i>Mark.</i>

2245
01:51:20,721 --> 01:51:22,348
We're done for the day.

2246
01:51:22,456 --> 01:51:25,016
Yeah. Yeah, l was just sitting here.

2247
01:51:28,695 --> 01:51:30,629
What happened to Sean?

2248
01:51:30,964 --> 01:51:33,398
He still owns 7 % of the company.

2249
01:51:37,571 --> 01:51:41,803
All you had all day was that salad.
Do you wanna get something to eat?

2250
01:51:41,908 --> 01:51:43,239
l can't.

2251
01:51:50,884 --> 01:51:52,146
l'm not a bad guy.

2252
01:51:52,252 --> 01:51:53,719
l know that.

2253
01:51:54,121 --> 01:51:57,613
When there's emotional testimony,
l assume 85 % of it is exaggeration.

2254
01:51:57,758 --> 01:51:59,225
And the other 15?

2255
01:51:59,292 --> 01:52:02,420
Perjury. Creation myths need a devil.

2256
01:52:06,066 --> 01:52:07,431
What happens now?

2257
01:52:08,568 --> 01:52:12,800
Sy and the others are having a steak
on University Avenue.

2258
01:52:13,306 --> 01:52:14,773
Then they'll come back up to the office,

2259
01:52:14,841 --> 01:52:18,140
and start working on a settlement
agreement to present to you.

2260
01:52:18,245 --> 01:52:20,145
- They're gonna settle?
- Oh, yeah.

2261
01:52:20,747 --> 01:52:23,614
- And you're gonna have to pay a little extra.
- Why?

2262
01:52:23,683 --> 01:52:25,844
So that these guys sign
a nondisclosure agreement.

2263
01:52:25,952 --> 01:52:28,944
They say one unflattering word about you
in public, you own their wife and kids.

2264
01:52:29,022 --> 01:52:30,250
l invented Facebook.

2265
01:52:30,323 --> 01:52:32,416
l'm talking about a jury.

2266
01:52:32,692 --> 01:52:35,286
l specialize in voir dire, jury selection.

2267
01:52:35,362 --> 01:52:37,762
What a jury sees
when they look at a defendant.

2268
01:52:37,831 --> 01:52:40,197
Clothes, hair, speaking style, likeability...

2269
01:52:40,300 --> 01:52:41,494
Likeability.

2270
01:52:41,601 --> 01:52:44,468
l've been licensed to practice law
for all of 20 months,

2271
01:52:44,538 --> 01:52:45,937
and l could get a jury to believe

2272
01:52:46,006 --> 01:52:48,702
that you planted the story
about Eduardo and the chicken.

2273
01:52:48,809 --> 01:52:49,867
Watch what else.

2274
01:52:50,377 --> 01:52:52,470
Why weren't you at Sean's sorority party
that night?

2275
01:52:53,213 --> 01:52:55,443
- You think l'm the one that called the police?
- Doesn't matter.

2276
01:52:55,515 --> 01:52:57,608
l asked the question,
now everybody's thinking about it.

2277
01:52:57,684 --> 01:52:59,811
You've lost your jury in the first 10 minutes.

2278
01:53:01,455 --> 01:53:02,615
Farm animals.

2279
01:53:02,689 --> 01:53:03,849
Yeah.

2280
01:53:04,858 --> 01:53:07,383
l was drunk and angry and stupid.

2281
01:53:07,494 --> 01:53:09,724
- And blogging.
- And blogging.

2282
01:53:10,864 --> 01:53:12,195
Pay them.

2283
01:53:12,466 --> 01:53:13,694
ln the scheme of things,

2284
01:53:14,167 --> 01:53:15,498
it's a speeding ticket.

2285
01:53:17,504 --> 01:53:19,870
That's what Sy will tell you tomorrow.

2286
01:53:19,973 --> 01:53:22,874
Do you think anybody would mind if l stayed
and used the computer for a minute?

2287
01:53:22,976 --> 01:53:24,500
l can't imagine it would be a problem.

2288
01:53:24,578 --> 01:53:25,806
Thanks.

2289
01:53:26,680 --> 01:53:29,012
l appreciate your help today.

2290
01:53:32,853 --> 01:53:35,083
You're not an asshole, Mark.

2291
01:53:36,323 --> 01:53:38,814
You're just trying so hard to be.
