1
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:52,030
Cracking job, Gromit.

2
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:53,834
Hang on, old chum.

3
00:04:54,474 --> 00:04:56,339
- What's going on?
- Who is it?

4
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:57,876
Reel him in, lad.

5
00:04:57,944 --> 00:05:00,378
To me. To me.

6
00:05:01,314 --> 00:05:03,942
Gotcha! Thieving monster.

7
00:05:10,657 --> 00:05:13,091
Me prize pumpkin.

8
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:17,220
Me little baby. Me pride and joy.

9
00:05:17,297 --> 00:05:19,993
You've saved it, Anti-Pesto.

10
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:21,761
It was nothing at all, Mrs...

11
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:25,901
- Everything's under control.
- Oh, no!

12
00:05:25,972 --> 00:05:27,701
Don't worry, madam.

13
00:05:31,144 --> 00:05:33,612
Thank you, Mr. Wallace.

14
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,739
All in a night's work, Mrs. Mulch.

15
00:05:37,851 --> 00:05:39,910
Oute little feller, isn't he?

16
00:05:39,986 --> 00:05:42,853
You'd never believe
they'd cause so much damage.

17
00:05:42,922 --> 00:05:44,753
Oh, he may look innocent, sir.

18
00:05:44,824 --> 00:05:47,019
But left to his own devices,

19
00:05:47,093 --> 00:05:50,620
this is the ultimate
vegetable-destroying machine.

20
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,464
Reg, me teeth!

21
00:05:57,637 --> 00:05:59,901
Job well done, lad.

22
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:05,504
Subject disarmed and neutralized.

23
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,907
Bless you, Anti-Pesto.

24
00:06:08,982 --> 00:06:12,418
With you out there protecting our veg,

25
00:06:12,485 --> 00:06:15,750
the most important event
of the year is safe.

26
00:06:15,822 --> 00:06:20,316
Aye. And I hope they give them pests
what's coming to 'em, and all.

27
00:06:20,393 --> 00:06:23,294
Amen to that, Mrs. Mulch.

28
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,638
It was a long, hard night
last night, Gromit.

29
00:07:50,717 --> 00:07:54,744
I'll need a good, hearty
breakfast under me belt.

30
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:57,720
Pile it up, lad.

31
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,919
I'm in the mood for food!

32
00:08:03,663 --> 00:08:06,063
Gromit, old pal.

33
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:10,193
It's happened again.
I'll need assistance.

34
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:30,656
Well, thanks, chuck.

35
00:08:30,723 --> 00:08:33,715
I'm sure that hole's getting smaller.

36
00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:41,028
Another successful night.
How are the inmates?

37
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,501
Must be getting
a bit full down there.

38
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:49,502
Talking of which.

39
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:52,306
Now, for a great big plate of...

40
00:08:54,247 --> 00:08:56,738
...vegetables.

41
00:08:58,518 --> 00:09:01,385
Still got me on the diet, eh, Gromit?

42
00:09:01,454 --> 00:09:05,481
Watching me shape?
There's a good dog.

43
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:09,192
Gromit, lad?

44
00:09:09,262 --> 00:09:12,595
How is that prize melon
of yours coming on?

45
00:09:12,665 --> 00:09:15,532
Must be a while
since you measured it.

46
00:09:43,296 --> 00:09:47,232
Lovely food. For rabbits, that is.

47
00:09:53,306 --> 00:09:57,868
As for me, I need something
a bit more cheesy.

48
00:10:18,665 --> 00:10:21,156
Oaught red-handed, eh, lad?

49
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,761
I'm sorry, Gromit.

50
00:10:26,205 --> 00:10:29,641
I know you're doing this
for my own good,

51
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:33,611
but the fact is
I'm just crackers about cheese.

52
00:10:34,647 --> 00:10:37,377
Look, if I must change me ways,

53
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,611
at least let me do it my way.

54
00:10:41,054 --> 00:10:43,454
With technology.

55
00:10:44,757 --> 00:10:47,988
It's time we tried my latest invention,

56
00:10:48,861 --> 00:10:52,854
the Mind Manipulation-omatic.

57
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:58,000
It extracts unwanted
thoughts and desires.

58
00:10:58,071 --> 00:11:02,531
I haven't tested it yet,
but it should be perfectly safe.

59
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:06,169
Just a bit of harmless
brain alteration, that's all.

60
00:11:15,221 --> 00:11:19,658
Anti-Pesto Humane Pest Oontrol.
How might we be of assistance?

61
00:11:19,726 --> 00:11:23,321
Yes. Lady Tottington here
of Tottington Hall.

62
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:24,761
Your Ladyship.

63
00:11:24,831 --> 00:11:27,026
This is an honor.

64
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,797
It's a disaster. I have
the most terrible rabbit problem.

65
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,829
The competition's only days away.
You simply have to do something.

66
00:11:34,907 --> 00:11:38,604
Oertainly, ma'am. I think we're
about to go up in the world, lad.

67
00:11:38,678 --> 00:11:41,476
Just stay right where you are,
your Ladyship,

68
00:11:41,547 --> 00:11:43,811
and we'll be with you in an...

69
00:11:45,318 --> 00:11:47,878
In an hour? I can't wait an hour.

70
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:52,482
I have a major infestation.
Hello? Hello?

71
00:11:54,694 --> 00:11:56,491
That's more like it.

72
00:11:59,198 --> 00:12:00,688
Thank goodness you've...

73
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:05,170
What ho! For you, my love.

74
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:10,139
Victor. How lovely and... unexpected.

75
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:13,178
Heard you had a spot of rabbit bother
and toodled on over

76
00:12:13,246 --> 00:12:14,713
to sort the blighters out.

77
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:17,409
Gosh, that's awfully sweet of you.

78
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:19,280
But you really needn't bother.

79
00:12:19,352 --> 00:12:23,288
It's no bother, little boo-boo. It's
the least a chap can do for his filly.

80
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:27,019
Don't want pests spoiling
our beautiful manor house, do we?

81
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:28,856
"Our" manor house?

82
00:12:28,928 --> 00:12:32,591
No one's mentioned marriage, Victor.

83
00:12:32,665 --> 00:12:34,656
All in good time, my dear.

84
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:36,725
Vermin first, though, what what.

85
00:12:36,803 --> 00:12:38,668
Oome on, Phillip.

86
00:12:38,738 --> 00:12:39,727
Victor!

87
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:43,298
We can deal with this humanely.

88
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:47,705
Very classy.

89
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,944
Just the sort of client
we should be dealing with, eh, lad?

90
00:13:05,031 --> 00:13:07,397
Burrowing bounders!

91
00:13:08,034 --> 00:13:10,002
They must be breeding like...

92
00:13:10,703 --> 00:13:12,728
...well, rabbits.

93
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,668
Only one thing for it, lad.

94
00:13:22,315 --> 00:13:24,545
Victor, hadn't we agreed?

95
00:13:24,617 --> 00:13:26,881
No more thoughtless killing.

96
00:13:26,953 --> 00:13:28,420
Quite right, my dear.

97
00:13:28,488 --> 00:13:31,116
So I've thought this one through
very carefully.

98
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,852
It's off to bunny heaven
for you, big ears.

99
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:35,257
Victor! No!

100
00:13:37,797 --> 00:13:39,424
What the...?

101
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:55,947
Ohampion sucker, eh, Gromit?

102
00:13:56,816 --> 00:13:59,614
The BunVac 6000.

103
00:14:03,256 --> 00:14:05,918
This'll impress her Ladyship.

104
00:14:06,058 --> 00:14:08,993
I don't understand.
It should have been a bull's-eye.

105
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:11,655
Oh, Victor. I felt we'd
made a real breakthrough

106
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:15,531
with this hunting obsession of yours.
I really thought you'd changed.

107
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:20,265
I'm sorry, Oampanula,
but I am what I am.

108
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:23,001
There's no nonsense
with Victor Quartermaine.

109
00:14:23,075 --> 00:14:25,805
What you see is what you get.

110
00:14:26,712 --> 00:14:28,270
What the...?

111
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:36,446
Sounds like a really big brute,
this one.

112
00:14:36,522 --> 00:14:37,819
Give it some more welly.

113
00:14:43,095 --> 00:14:44,084
Gosh!

114
00:14:53,906 --> 00:14:56,898
Maybe I should've
used a bigger nozzle.

115
00:14:58,444 --> 00:15:01,880
Anti-Pesto, you're here.

116
00:15:04,183 --> 00:15:06,549
Your Ladyship.

117
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,980
My darlings!

118
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:14,526
You're safe.

119
00:15:15,795 --> 00:15:16,853
My word!

120
00:15:16,929 --> 00:15:20,888
What a fabulous job you've done.
And not a single one harmed.

121
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:23,993
The old BV6000, ma'am.

122
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:28,404
Oapable of 125 RPM.
That's rabbits per minute.

123
00:15:28,474 --> 00:15:31,170
How inspired!

124
00:15:31,244 --> 00:15:32,734
- Mr...?
- Oh, Wallace.

125
00:15:32,812 --> 00:15:34,473
Mr. Wallace.

126
00:15:34,547 --> 00:15:36,811
Is this all of them?

127
00:15:36,882 --> 00:15:40,648
Just one left.
Hoist her up, Gromit.

128
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:54,364
Victor, stop fooling around in the dirt
and have a look at this.

129
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:56,731
The ingenious Anti-Pesto

130
00:15:56,802 --> 00:15:59,532
have completely dealt
with my rabbit problem.

131
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,971
- Isn't it marvelous?
- Marvelous?

132
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:03,100
Marvelous?

133
00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:07,305
This confounded contraption
virtually suffocated me!

134
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,112
Besides, the job's only half done.

135
00:16:12,184 --> 00:16:14,618
How do you intend
to finish these vermin off?

136
00:16:14,687 --> 00:16:16,746
Orush 'em? Liquidize 'em?

137
00:16:16,822 --> 00:16:20,588
- They're humane.
- Humane?

138
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,757
Well, then perhaps they'd be humane
enough to give me back my dignity.

139
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:27,458
I want...

140
00:16:31,337 --> 00:16:33,271
Toupee, please.

141
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:36,433
Oh, grand.
We take check or cash.

142
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:40,969
Toupee, you idiot!
My hair is in your machine.

143
00:16:41,047 --> 00:16:44,414
Oh, no, it's only rabbits in there.

144
00:16:44,483 --> 00:16:47,782
The hare, I think you'll find,
is a much larger mammal.

145
00:16:47,853 --> 00:16:49,684
Out of my way, fool.

146
00:16:54,226 --> 00:16:58,026
I'm sorry, my dear, but I refuse
to suffer any further humiliation

147
00:16:58,097 --> 00:17:00,895
at the hands of these
blundering nitwits.

148
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:03,696
I therefore bid you good day.

149
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:13,311
Thank you for ridding me
of a real problem, Mr. Wallace.

150
00:17:13,379 --> 00:17:17,611
Tell me, what exactly will you do
with all these rabbits?

151
00:17:18,684 --> 00:17:20,447
Trade secret.

152
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:24,478
Yes. I'd be happy to let them roam free
if it wasn't for the competition.

153
00:17:24,557 --> 00:17:26,525
But they do so love their veg.

154
00:17:26,592 --> 00:17:30,323
It's in their little bunny natures,
and you can't change that, can you?

155
00:17:30,396 --> 00:17:32,091
No.

156
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:38,293
Or can you?

157
00:17:41,941 --> 00:17:45,308
Why didn't we think of it before, lad?

158
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:49,970
The solution to all
our storage problems.

159
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:53,780
Simply by connecting the BunVac

160
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:56,720
to the Mind Manipulation-omatic,

161
00:17:57,056 --> 00:17:59,547
we can brainwash the bunnies.

162
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:03,457
Rabbit rehabilitation.

163
00:18:05,231 --> 00:18:10,362
Once cured of their antisocial
veg-ravaging behavior,

164
00:18:10,436 --> 00:18:14,896
the rabbits can be safely released
without fear of re-offending.

165
00:18:15,908 --> 00:18:20,607
Just a little added lunar power
to enhance the mind waves...

166
00:18:26,552 --> 00:18:28,679
...and we can begin.

167
00:18:32,591 --> 00:18:35,389
Veg, bad.

168
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:38,362
Veg, bad.

169
00:18:38,431 --> 00:18:40,922
Veg, bad.

170
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:45,695
Say no to carrots,

171
00:18:45,771 --> 00:18:49,298
cabbage and cauliflower.

172
00:18:51,844 --> 00:18:54,438
Well, come on, lad,
what are you waiting for?

173
00:18:54,513 --> 00:18:56,378
Turn on the BunVac.

174
00:18:56,449 --> 00:18:58,007
Full suction.

175
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:15,628
It's working, Gromit.
It's working!

176
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:22,264
Their tiny bunny brains

177
00:19:22,341 --> 00:19:26,937
are being saturated
in my veg-free mind waves.

178
00:19:29,715 --> 00:19:32,377
Another 30 minutes
brainwashing should suffice.

179
00:19:32,451 --> 00:19:36,080
Then we can move on
to the conditioning.

180
00:19:48,801 --> 00:19:50,063
Gromit!

181
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:53,463
Switch it off!

182
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:55,006
Get it off!

183
00:19:56,709 --> 00:19:58,643
Get it off me, lad!

184
00:20:11,857 --> 00:20:14,758
Oh, thanks, lad.

185
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,862
Quick.

186
00:20:22,935 --> 00:20:24,903
Give us a carrot.

187
00:20:34,313 --> 00:20:36,440
It worked, Gromit!

188
00:20:36,515 --> 00:20:38,847
A reformed rabbit.

189
00:20:38,918 --> 00:20:42,547
We'll call him Hutch. Shall we?

190
00:20:42,621 --> 00:20:44,748
Oome on. Let's get the kettle on.

191
00:20:44,823 --> 00:20:47,223
We'll see to him in the morning.

192
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:55,624
I feel we're on the cusp
of a real breakthrough, lad.

193
00:20:58,404 --> 00:21:03,603
Mankind freed from
rabbit problems forever.

194
00:21:07,212 --> 00:21:10,238
Lady Tottington will be impressed.

195
00:22:01,433 --> 00:22:02,593
Good night.

196
00:22:04,503 --> 00:22:06,130
Sleep tight.

197
00:22:06,205 --> 00:22:09,106
And don't let the bed bugs bite.

198
00:22:23,288 --> 00:22:25,813
Good night, Gromit.

199
00:22:25,891 --> 00:22:28,724
Sweet dreams, old chum.

200
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:54,653
Protect and nourish the frail
and the weak, O Lord.

201
00:22:54,653 --> 00:22:59,147
Protect and nourish the frail
and the weak, O Lord.

202
00:22:59,224 --> 00:23:04,127
Let them grow big and strong
under Thy loving care.

203
00:23:04,196 --> 00:23:08,656
In fact, let them grow bigger
and stronger than anyone else's,

204
00:23:08,734 --> 00:23:11,965
so that the first prize might be mine.

205
00:23:12,037 --> 00:23:14,232
Amen.

206
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:18,409
The harvest offering
to bind the deal.

207
00:23:19,344 --> 00:23:24,281
We plow the fields
and scatter the good seed on...

208
00:23:47,706 --> 00:23:50,539
He sends the snow in winter...

209
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,550
All good gifts around us

210
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:02,985
Are sent from...

211
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:06,587
Heavens above.

212
00:24:06,658 --> 00:24:07,818
Hello?

213
00:24:11,396 --> 00:24:14,593
Hello? Is anybody there?

214
00:24:18,403 --> 00:24:20,428
Mrs. Mulch?

215
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,341
Please, come forward,
whoever you are.

216
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:27,105
There's no need to be afraid.

217
00:24:30,349 --> 00:24:35,218
You're hungry.
Then please, take what you like.

218
00:24:35,287 --> 00:24:38,484
It is for the needy, after all.

219
00:24:43,762 --> 00:24:46,492
No! No! No! No!

220
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,365
Mercy!

221
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:56,028
Morning, Gromit.

222
00:25:59,605 --> 00:26:04,042
A pest-free night per... chance?

223
00:26:10,215 --> 00:26:12,740
Lummy day.

224
00:26:13,552 --> 00:26:15,354
- It's a disaster.
- Me garden's ruined.

225
00:26:15,354 --> 00:26:16,252
- It's a disaster.
- Me garden's ruined.

226
00:26:16,321 --> 00:26:19,017
- It's carnage out there.
- Where were Anti-Pesto?

227
00:26:19,091 --> 00:26:21,855
Simmer down.
Simmer down, now.

228
00:26:21,927 --> 00:26:26,091
Right. One at a time, if ya please.

229
00:26:26,164 --> 00:26:29,133
We pay good money
for our crop protection.

230
00:26:29,201 --> 00:26:33,638
If ya can't deliver the goods,
maybe you should keep your traps shut.

231
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:37,536
I never saw such cauliflower carnage.

232
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:40,806
Worse than the
Great Slug Blight of '32,

233
00:26:40,879 --> 00:26:44,679
when there were slugs
the size of pigs.

234
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,911
Growbag's right. The slugs are back!

235
00:26:46,985 --> 00:26:48,213
The slugs are back!

236
00:26:48,287 --> 00:26:50,380
That's enough! That's enough!

237
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:55,222
Look, this flippin'
vegetable competition

238
00:26:55,294 --> 00:26:58,127
- causes nothin' but trouble every year.
- Here we go.

239
00:26:58,196 --> 00:26:59,925
- If ya ask me...
- Get on with ya!

240
00:26:59,998 --> 00:27:05,197
Know what? I'll tell ya.
If ya ask me, this was arson.

241
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,737
- Arson?
- Aye!

242
00:27:06,805 --> 00:27:09,501
Someone arsin' around.

243
00:27:09,574 --> 00:27:12,975
That's right.
One of you lot. A man.

244
00:27:13,045 --> 00:27:15,513
- This was no man.
- What are you saying?

245
00:27:19,618 --> 00:27:22,109
Does a man have teeth

246
00:27:22,187 --> 00:27:25,054
the size of axe blades?

247
00:27:29,261 --> 00:27:33,288
Or ears like terrible tombstones?

248
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:37,567
By tampering with nature,

249
00:27:37,636 --> 00:27:42,369
forcing vegetables to swell
far beyond their natural size,

250
00:27:42,441 --> 00:27:47,310
we have brought a terrible judgment
upon ourselves.

251
00:27:49,414 --> 00:27:51,109
Hey! Give over!

252
00:27:54,786 --> 00:27:56,117
You're mental.

253
00:27:56,188 --> 00:27:57,450
And for our sins,

254
00:27:57,522 --> 00:28:01,458
a hideous creature
has been sent to punish us all!

255
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,755
Repent! Repent!

256
00:28:03,795 --> 00:28:07,629
Lest you too, taste the wrath of...

257
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:11,730
...the Were-Rabbit!

258
00:28:12,971 --> 00:28:16,907
This is terrible!
What's going to happen to us?

259
00:28:16,975 --> 00:28:19,136
- Doomed!
- Who's going to help us?

260
00:28:19,211 --> 00:28:22,408
- What's to become of the show?
- We live for that competition.

261
00:28:22,481 --> 00:28:25,143
- Get off me.
- We're simple folk. It's all we have.

262
00:28:25,217 --> 00:28:27,685
- Who will save us?
- Get... Hey!

263
00:28:29,721 --> 00:28:31,416
A Were-Rabbit?

264
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,752
Oh, come, come, now.

265
00:28:32,824 --> 00:28:36,521
I do believe the vicar's been
to the communion wine again.

266
00:28:38,997 --> 00:28:42,899
What we are dealing with here
is no supernatural rabbit.

267
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:46,426
It's a big fellow, perhaps.

268
00:28:46,505 --> 00:28:48,939
But a mortal creature
of flesh and blood.

269
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:52,670
A matter easily dealt with
by a hunter.

270
00:28:53,045 --> 00:28:57,209
Guns will not be necessary,
thank you, Victor.

271
00:28:57,282 --> 00:29:00,410
Hasn't there been enough destruction?

272
00:29:02,154 --> 00:29:05,248
I believe the killing
of fluffy creatures

273
00:29:05,323 --> 00:29:07,450
is neverjustified.

274
00:29:07,526 --> 00:29:11,622
I say we give Anti-Pesto
a second chance.

275
00:29:11,696 --> 00:29:15,860
What? How on earth would
those tiny-minded buffoons

276
00:29:15,934 --> 00:29:18,801
ever catch such a big rabbit?

277
00:29:19,571 --> 00:29:21,471
Mr. Wallace?

278
00:29:27,612 --> 00:29:29,705
Well...

279
00:29:33,952 --> 00:29:36,045
With a big trap.

280
00:29:36,121 --> 00:29:39,284
By Jove. He's... He's got it!

281
00:29:39,357 --> 00:29:40,756
- Genius!
- Genius!

282
00:29:40,826 --> 00:29:42,623
- Brilliant.
- What a great idea!

283
00:29:42,694 --> 00:29:45,128
Olever.

284
00:29:46,098 --> 00:29:48,066
You see, Victor,

285
00:29:48,133 --> 00:29:51,296
there's hope for the vegetables yet.

286
00:29:52,704 --> 00:29:54,934
Not the ones I'm looking at.

287
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:58,566
That's me boys!

288
00:30:08,753 --> 00:30:10,482
Love, Gromit.

289
00:30:10,555 --> 00:30:13,649
That's the biggest trap of all.

290
00:30:13,725 --> 00:30:15,852
The "tender trap," they call it.

291
00:30:15,927 --> 00:30:18,725
And that's what we'll use
to catch this thing.

292
00:30:18,797 --> 00:30:22,961
Yes, lad, a lovely lady rabbit.

293
00:30:26,271 --> 00:30:30,264
How could any
hot-blooded rabbit-beast resist?

294
00:30:40,051 --> 00:30:42,144
Oh, come on, Gromit.

295
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:46,418
A bit more, you know, alluring.

296
00:30:53,498 --> 00:30:55,261
Very cheeky.

297
00:31:03,808 --> 00:31:05,901
That's more like it, lad.

298
00:31:05,977 --> 00:31:08,639
How can we possibly fail now?

299
00:31:09,514 --> 00:31:11,880
You're a total knockout.

300
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:22,092
Stick around, lad.

301
00:31:22,928 --> 00:31:26,091
Should fix back on quite easily.

302
00:34:25,009 --> 00:34:27,443
Nighty-night, me lovelies.

303
00:34:28,446 --> 00:34:30,846
Think big now.

304
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:48,358
No!

305
00:35:36,915 --> 00:35:39,907
Don't worry. No. No.

306
00:35:39,984 --> 00:35:42,578
Well, I'm very sorry, Mrs. Mulch.

307
00:35:42,654 --> 00:35:45,623
We'll get there as soon as we can.
Mr. Dibber. Oh, yes.

308
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:48,682
Oan I call you back? Mrs. Girdling.

309
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,661
- A tunnel you say?
- What do you intend to do about this?

310
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:53,594
I'll look into it.

311
00:35:53,932 --> 00:35:56,093
So where did you get to, lad?

312
00:35:56,167 --> 00:35:58,465
I thought I told you to stay put.

313
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:00,538
It's gone mad around here.

314
00:36:00,972 --> 00:36:04,339
I thought we were
supposed to be a team.

315
00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:06,834
How are we ever
gonna catch this thing

316
00:36:06,911 --> 00:36:10,403
if you go gallivanting off
on your own all the time?

317
00:36:11,449 --> 00:36:13,144
You're doing it again!

318
00:36:13,218 --> 00:36:15,982
Where are you going now?

319
00:36:16,054 --> 00:36:17,783
Gromit!

320
00:36:19,491 --> 00:36:20,651
Grommy!

321
00:36:23,061 --> 00:36:24,289
Really, lad.

322
00:36:24,362 --> 00:36:28,662
You do realize I've made
a personal promise to Lady Tottington.

323
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:31,167
How is this sort of
behavior going to get us

324
00:36:31,236 --> 00:36:35,263
any nearer to finding
a rabbit-mon... ster?

325
00:36:41,546 --> 00:36:43,446
Hutch.

326
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,241
Oh, Gromit.

327
00:36:47,318 --> 00:36:50,310
We've created a monster.

328
00:36:50,388 --> 00:36:53,084
Hutch is the beast.

329
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:56,827
The lunar panels.

330
00:36:58,162 --> 00:37:03,862
They must've over-stimulated
Hutch's primitive bunny nature.

331
00:37:03,935 --> 00:37:06,301
And now, when the moon appears,

332
00:37:06,371 --> 00:37:10,603
he undergoes
a hideous transformation.

333
00:37:26,558 --> 00:37:28,321
Oh, Gromit.

334
00:37:30,094 --> 00:37:33,825
This is absolutely...

335
00:37:35,366 --> 00:37:37,391
...fantastic!

336
00:37:38,036 --> 00:37:39,833
Don't you see, lad?

337
00:37:39,904 --> 00:37:43,465
OK, so we've created
a veg-ravaging rabbit-monster.

338
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:47,204
But we've also captured it.

339
00:37:47,278 --> 00:37:49,712
Just like I promised Lady Tottington.

340
00:37:49,781 --> 00:37:52,409
I'll go and tell her the good news.

341
00:37:53,084 --> 00:37:55,575
Make sure he doesn't escape.

342
00:37:55,653 --> 00:37:57,052
Bye!

343
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:33,878
Mr. Wallace.

344
00:39:33,951 --> 00:39:38,081
It's the beast, your Ladyship.
I bring great news.

345
00:39:38,156 --> 00:39:41,853
Gosh, how exciting.
Please, do come in.

346
00:39:54,038 --> 00:39:57,098
Well, this is simply spiffing news.

347
00:39:57,175 --> 00:40:01,077
With the beast in captivity,
the competition can go ahead as planned.

348
00:40:01,145 --> 00:40:03,909
You saved the day, Mr. Wallace.

349
00:40:03,981 --> 00:40:06,074
It was nothing, your Ladyship.

350
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,277
So modest.

351
00:40:08,352 --> 00:40:10,115
Oh, please, do help yourself.

352
00:40:11,723 --> 00:40:13,384
Thanks.

353
00:40:14,859 --> 00:40:19,193
I so appreciate you coming
all this way to let me know, Wallace.

354
00:40:19,263 --> 00:40:22,323
Tell me, are you
a vegetable-lover yourself?

355
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,733
- They're... growing on me.
- Then come with me.

356
00:40:25,803 --> 00:40:30,001
There's something
very special I want to show you.

357
00:40:37,815 --> 00:40:39,305
Hop in.

358
00:40:40,351 --> 00:40:44,117
- It's very snug.
- It's my Jacob's ladder.

359
00:40:45,156 --> 00:40:48,421
And it goes all the way to heaven.

360
00:40:57,969 --> 00:41:01,598
Welcome to my inner sanctum, Wallace.

361
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,200
My secret garden.

362
00:41:05,843 --> 00:41:08,676
It's a veritable

363
00:41:08,746 --> 00:41:12,375
vegetable paradise.

364
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:14,782
I just knew you'd love it.

365
00:41:14,852 --> 00:41:16,547
Unlike Victor.

366
00:41:16,621 --> 00:41:20,250
He's never shown
any interest in my produce.

367
00:41:20,324 --> 00:41:23,225
- His loss, Lady Tottington.
- Please, Wallace.

368
00:41:23,895 --> 00:41:25,658
Oall me Totty.

369
00:41:37,241 --> 00:41:39,903
If anything were to happen
to my vegetables,

370
00:41:39,977 --> 00:41:41,706
I don't know what I'd do.

371
00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:43,974
I'm sure you understand, Mr. Wallace.

372
00:41:44,048 --> 00:41:46,414
I can see that you're
a true nature lover.

373
00:41:46,484 --> 00:41:48,611
Oh, yes. Yes, I am.

374
00:41:49,287 --> 00:41:51,755
At first, I thought
I could change Victor.

375
00:41:51,823 --> 00:41:53,882
Now I'm not so sure.

376
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,892
Do you think a man can change, Wallace?

377
00:41:57,995 --> 00:41:59,622
Ohange?

378
00:41:59,664 --> 00:42:00,995
Oh, yes.

379
00:42:06,337 --> 00:42:10,330
Really, Phillip.
The things one does for love.

380
00:42:18,583 --> 00:42:20,312
Pesto.

381
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:24,647
- Mr. Wallace.
- Oh, Totty.

382
00:42:25,489 --> 00:42:26,922
Totty?

383
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:34,293
I'd like to show you one last thing.

384
00:42:34,365 --> 00:42:38,461
Something no other man
has ever seen.

385
00:42:40,371 --> 00:42:42,896
My carrot de Ohantenay.

386
00:42:44,075 --> 00:42:45,667
Just smell it, Wallace.

387
00:42:45,743 --> 00:42:48,109
- Feel its silken flesh.
- Oh, yes.

388
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:52,138
Isn't it the most sumptuous,
succulent specimen you've ever seen?

389
00:42:52,216 --> 00:42:54,275
- Yes!
- Doesn't it fill your heart

390
00:42:54,352 --> 00:42:55,478
- with desire?
- Yes!

391
00:42:55,553 --> 00:42:59,045
Just imagine
what it would taste like.

392
00:43:04,629 --> 00:43:07,393
What on earth
were you thinkin' of, lad?

393
00:43:07,465 --> 00:43:11,401
Ruined a perfectly good piece
of fashionable knitwear, that did.

394
00:43:11,469 --> 00:43:15,371
To say nothing of a relationship
with an important client.

395
00:43:17,408 --> 00:43:21,674
It's lucky for us her Ladyship
was so understanding.

396
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:25,679
Honestly, I don't know
what's got into you lately.

397
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:28,082
And slow down for pity's sake.

398
00:43:28,152 --> 00:43:30,177
You'll buckle me trunnions.

399
00:43:37,295 --> 00:43:39,456
Don't worry. I'll see to this.

400
00:43:40,164 --> 00:43:43,600
You stay here where you belong.
In the doghouse.

401
00:43:48,072 --> 00:43:49,733
Right.

402
00:43:53,144 --> 00:43:54,941
It's heavier than it looks.

403
00:44:04,622 --> 00:44:06,886
I know your little secret, Pesto.

404
00:44:06,958 --> 00:44:09,927
- I know exactly what's going on.
- Your Lordship...

405
00:44:09,994 --> 00:44:12,861
Yes. You think you can
pilfer my filly, don't you?

406
00:44:13,698 --> 00:44:16,258
You think you can con
a woman out of her fortune?

407
00:44:16,334 --> 00:44:18,928
- Who, me?
- Well, I got here first!

408
00:44:19,003 --> 00:44:22,530
I've spent a long time reeling in
that fluffy-headed bunny-lover.

409
00:44:22,606 --> 00:44:26,303
And I'm not about to let some
puddle-headed peasant poach her from me.

410
00:44:26,377 --> 00:44:29,073
- Oomprenez?
- Right-o.

411
00:44:29,146 --> 00:44:31,137
I'll be off then. Ta-ta.

412
00:44:32,783 --> 00:44:35,308
You're not going anywhere, Pesto.

413
00:44:37,888 --> 00:44:41,346
Not until I've taught you
a jolly good lesson.

414
00:44:45,062 --> 00:44:46,859
Oome on! Queensberry rules!

415
00:44:46,931 --> 00:44:48,922
Put 'em up, ya little pipsqueak.

416
00:44:51,635 --> 00:44:53,694
You're shaking.

417
00:44:53,771 --> 00:44:57,502
Don't tell me you're a scaredy-cat
as well as a scoundrel.

418
00:45:02,313 --> 00:45:04,804
And don't think acting
like a big girl's blouse

419
00:45:04,882 --> 00:45:06,645
will get you out of it.

420
00:45:06,717 --> 00:45:09,277
There's no mercy
with Victor Quartermaine.

421
00:45:27,238 --> 00:45:28,796
What the dickens?

422
00:45:33,878 --> 00:45:35,607
What on earth...?

423
00:46:16,887 --> 00:46:18,821
Phillip! Attack!

424
00:46:18,889 --> 00:46:20,083
Attack!

425
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,084
What the...?

426
00:47:18,716 --> 00:47:19,705
Vicar!

427
00:47:20,384 --> 00:47:23,376
Vicar! Oh, where the devil is he?

428
00:47:23,454 --> 00:47:24,716
Do you want to confess?

429
00:47:24,788 --> 00:47:27,723
I want to talk to you about...

430
00:47:27,791 --> 00:47:29,418
...the beast.

431
00:47:31,428 --> 00:47:35,330
Everything you need
to know is in this book.

432
00:47:37,535 --> 00:47:42,097
- "Nun Wrestling."
- No. I meant this one.

433
00:47:58,022 --> 00:48:00,183
Here. Here it is.

434
00:48:00,257 --> 00:48:04,751
The hideous monster
plaguing our parish.

435
00:48:04,828 --> 00:48:07,422
The Were-Rabbit.

436
00:48:09,967 --> 00:48:11,628
So it's true.

437
00:48:11,702 --> 00:48:15,103
The beast lurks
within all of us, my child.

438
00:48:15,172 --> 00:48:20,109
The side that emerges at night
as the moon rises into the sky.

439
00:48:20,177 --> 00:48:23,442
The side that
savagely rips the leaves

440
00:48:23,514 --> 00:48:25,982
off any innocent cabbage.

441
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:27,608
Spare me the sermon, Vicar.

442
00:48:27,685 --> 00:48:31,621
Just tell me how I kill him.
I mean "it."

443
00:48:31,689 --> 00:48:33,884
To kill such a creature

444
00:48:33,958 --> 00:48:36,654
would require nerves of steel

445
00:48:36,727 --> 00:48:38,524
and...

446
00:48:39,463 --> 00:48:41,260
...a bullet.

447
00:48:41,899 --> 00:48:43,890
A bullet?

448
00:48:44,535 --> 00:48:46,127
A bullet.

449
00:48:46,537 --> 00:48:48,198
A bull...

450
00:48:49,273 --> 00:48:51,298
What kind of bullet?

451
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:56,074
A bullet of pure gold.

452
00:49:00,985 --> 00:49:02,418
Gold.

453
00:49:02,486 --> 00:49:03,953
Yes.

454
00:49:04,021 --> 00:49:07,479
Twenty-four karat.

455
00:49:09,026 --> 00:49:10,516
Get out of my way.

456
00:49:11,528 --> 00:49:13,359
Silly old fool.

457
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:17,890
Beware!
Beware of the beast within!

458
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:15,322
Perfect re-entry, Gromit.

459
00:50:15,392 --> 00:50:18,259
This veg diet's
doing the trick, eh, lad?

460
00:50:18,329 --> 00:50:20,729
I feel smashing.

461
00:50:22,933 --> 00:50:26,892
So how's our rabbit-monster?

462
00:50:28,238 --> 00:50:30,399
Hope you're keeping an eye on him.

463
00:50:41,251 --> 00:50:43,082
What's up, dog?

464
00:50:50,294 --> 00:50:52,023
Well, fancy that.

465
00:50:52,096 --> 00:50:54,326
Rabbit ears.

466
00:50:54,398 --> 00:50:56,366
That is a bit odd.

467
00:51:00,003 --> 00:51:02,233
And what are you tryin' to say, lad?

468
00:51:05,709 --> 00:51:07,006
What?

469
00:51:07,077 --> 00:51:08,908
What?

470
00:51:08,979 --> 00:51:12,380
What? You think that I'm the...?

471
00:51:13,884 --> 00:51:15,647
Because of these?

472
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:17,050
Oh, no.

473
00:51:17,121 --> 00:51:19,681
No. This is just a reaction

474
00:51:19,757 --> 00:51:22,988
to that healthy veg diet
you've got me on.

475
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:25,620
It's the toxins coming out.

476
00:51:25,696 --> 00:51:27,994
Silly old pooch.

477
00:51:28,065 --> 00:51:30,431
Thinking I'm the beast.

478
00:51:31,835 --> 00:51:34,030
Next thing you'll be saying

479
00:51:34,104 --> 00:51:37,301
is that Hutch
is turning into me.

480
00:51:41,011 --> 00:51:44,310
Hey. What are you doing, lad?

481
00:51:44,381 --> 00:51:46,679
Have you gone completely mad?

482
00:51:52,623 --> 00:51:55,148
Oheese!

483
00:51:57,127 --> 00:51:59,118
Oheese?

484
00:52:30,294 --> 00:52:34,697
I do like a bit of Gorgonzola.

485
00:52:38,702 --> 00:52:41,193
Oh, dear.

486
00:52:44,675 --> 00:52:46,540
- Perfect.
- Ma'am.

487
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:49,135
- Now, let's see.
- Ooming through!

488
00:52:50,147 --> 00:52:51,774
The tombola's arrived.

489
00:52:51,849 --> 00:52:54,977
And the bouncy Tottington Hall.

490
00:52:55,052 --> 00:52:57,384
Splendid.

491
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:03,655
It's going to be such
a jolly competition tonight.

492
00:53:03,727 --> 00:53:05,251
I just know it.

493
00:53:05,329 --> 00:53:07,661
- Ya don't know nothin'.
- What?

494
00:53:07,731 --> 00:53:11,098
The beast has struck again.
That's what.

495
00:53:11,702 --> 00:53:13,636
That's right!

496
00:53:13,704 --> 00:53:15,831
No, you're quite mistaken, Mrs. Mulch.

497
00:53:15,906 --> 00:53:18,136
- The beast is in captivity.
- Oh, yeah?

498
00:53:18,208 --> 00:53:21,905
Then just take a look
at my wife's brassicas.

499
00:53:21,979 --> 00:53:24,948
- Ravaged in the night.
- But I don't understand.

500
00:53:25,015 --> 00:53:27,643
- Anti-Pesto told me...
- A pack of lies!

501
00:53:27,718 --> 00:53:30,585
It's not safe to bring
our vegetables here.

502
00:53:30,654 --> 00:53:33,248
The show's off.

503
00:53:35,392 --> 00:53:38,156
But this is simply dreadful news.

504
00:53:39,196 --> 00:53:43,132
The Tottingtons have held
a giant vegetable competition

505
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,000
on this very night
for over 500 years.

506
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:48,970
That's right.

507
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:54,306
Not even the Great Duck Plague
of '53 stopped it.

508
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:58,741
If only there were another way.

509
00:54:00,217 --> 00:54:02,117
What ho!

510
00:54:02,953 --> 00:54:04,477
It's Quartermaine.

511
00:54:04,555 --> 00:54:07,649
Heard you had a spot of rabbit bother.

512
00:54:15,232 --> 00:54:16,893
Didn't this bit used to...?

513
00:54:19,436 --> 00:54:22,928
Now. Now, let's see.

514
00:54:24,207 --> 00:54:26,937
Where does this part go?

515
00:54:38,121 --> 00:54:39,986
Oh, it's hopeless.

516
00:54:40,057 --> 00:54:42,821
I'll never fix this flippin' machine.

517
00:54:42,893 --> 00:54:46,385
Me mind's just a rabbit-y mush.

518
00:54:46,463 --> 00:54:48,522
Oh, Gromit.

519
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:52,933
I don't wanna be a giant rabbit!

520
00:54:57,608 --> 00:55:01,339
The bounce is gone from his bungee.

521
00:55:13,156 --> 00:55:17,991
Hey, presto! Rabbit rehabilitation.

522
00:55:19,029 --> 00:55:21,589
But if I can't fix it...

523
00:55:22,232 --> 00:55:23,563
Oheddar.

524
00:55:23,634 --> 00:55:26,467
...maybe the other me can!

525
00:55:26,536 --> 00:55:28,470
I'm inventing, mostly.

526
00:55:28,538 --> 00:55:32,565
Look at me go! I'm a genius.

527
00:55:34,044 --> 00:55:38,003
Awake! I can't answer the door.
Not like this.

528
00:55:38,548 --> 00:55:41,108
Oharming. I'm Wallace.

529
00:55:41,652 --> 00:55:43,552
I already am!

530
00:55:44,154 --> 00:55:45,143
Hutch!

531
00:55:48,291 --> 00:55:50,054
Geronimo!

532
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,021
Wallace?

533
00:55:52,095 --> 00:55:54,188
Hang on a mo'.

534
00:55:55,632 --> 00:55:56,826
Wallace?

535
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:00,734
Hello? I say.
Open this door at once.

536
00:56:03,573 --> 00:56:05,541
Totty.

537
00:56:05,609 --> 00:56:08,134
Lady Tottington, if you don't mind.

538
00:56:08,712 --> 00:56:11,272
I'm afraid I have some
rather bad news, Wallace.

539
00:56:11,348 --> 00:56:13,839
Thing is, well,

540
00:56:13,917 --> 00:56:18,581
you've rather let me down
with this beastly beast business.

541
00:56:19,122 --> 00:56:21,056
- I suppose I have.
- Yes.

542
00:56:21,124 --> 00:56:23,922
It's obvious to me
that you have absolutely no idea

543
00:56:23,994 --> 00:56:25,621
where this poor creature is.

544
00:56:25,696 --> 00:56:28,358
And I'm afraid
you've given me no option

545
00:56:28,432 --> 00:56:31,959
but to let Victor
shoot the poor thing.

546
00:56:32,769 --> 00:56:34,100
Shoot it?

547
00:56:34,871 --> 00:56:37,806
Yes. Wasn't an easy choice,

548
00:56:37,874 --> 00:56:40,206
but the veg competition
has to come first.

549
00:56:40,277 --> 00:56:43,474
Besides, Victor's promised me
it won't suffer.

550
00:56:43,547 --> 00:56:45,777
It will be quick and painless.

551
00:56:45,849 --> 00:56:48,113
How thoughtful.

552
00:56:48,185 --> 00:56:51,052
I cannot deny it was
a difficult decision for me.

553
00:56:51,121 --> 00:56:53,749
Because I've recently developed...

554
00:56:53,824 --> 00:56:55,314
Hurry!

555
00:56:56,293 --> 00:56:57,658
...feelings for you.

556
00:56:57,728 --> 00:57:01,061
Feelings?
Oh, well, never mind, eh?

557
00:57:01,631 --> 00:57:03,792
- Ta-ra, then.
- Wait! Wallace.

558
00:57:03,867 --> 00:57:06,700
I haven't finished.
There's more that needs to be said.

559
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:09,034
Well, I'll give you a tinkle, shall I?

560
00:57:09,106 --> 00:57:11,597
Oan't we at least shake hands?
Part as friends?

561
00:57:11,675 --> 00:57:14,166
It's not very convenient
at the moment.

562
00:57:14,244 --> 00:57:16,075
Thanks for coming by.

563
00:57:16,713 --> 00:57:18,977
Well, I... I...

564
00:57:34,431 --> 00:57:36,729
That's right, my lovely.

565
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:41,328
You can say goodbye
to your fluffy lover-boy.

566
00:57:44,674 --> 00:57:46,073
You gotta help me, Gromit!

567
00:57:46,143 --> 00:57:48,168
Hide me. Anything.

568
00:57:48,245 --> 00:57:50,236
Before it's too late!

569
00:57:50,313 --> 00:57:51,837
Lad!

570
00:57:51,915 --> 00:57:53,610
Your Lordship.

571
00:58:25,348 --> 00:58:27,248
Good night, Gromit.

572
00:59:19,903 --> 00:59:22,064
'Tis done.

573
00:59:26,042 --> 00:59:28,772
My poor sensitive child.

574
00:59:28,845 --> 00:59:34,112
Allow us all to share
in your moment of sorrow.

575
00:59:38,288 --> 00:59:39,983
Yeah!

576
00:59:41,892 --> 00:59:44,690
On with the show!

577
00:59:55,605 --> 00:59:57,197
What the...?

578
01:00:01,077 --> 01:00:03,477
Why you...

579
01:00:17,093 --> 01:00:18,526
Of course.

580
01:00:19,229 --> 01:00:21,857
The vegetable competition.

581
01:00:23,433 --> 01:00:25,924
Your loyalty is moving.

582
01:00:26,002 --> 01:00:28,596
Sadly, you won't be.

583
01:00:28,672 --> 01:00:29,866
Oome along, Phillip.

584
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:33,239
Everyone's been looking
forward to a good show.

585
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:36,006
Let's see they get one.

586
01:01:05,709 --> 01:01:08,234
- Hooray!
- Mr. Growbag.

587
01:01:08,311 --> 01:01:13,010
I... I have a hunch
this'll be a night to remember.

588
01:01:14,117 --> 01:01:15,778
I just have a hunch.

589
01:01:15,852 --> 01:01:18,878
All right. All right.
If we must do this flipping veg show,

590
01:01:18,955 --> 01:01:21,719
let's do it in an orderly
and law-abiding fashion.

591
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:23,622
Oucumbers, give way to melons.

592
01:01:23,693 --> 01:01:25,854
Oarrots, wait your turn!

593
01:01:25,929 --> 01:01:28,454
- Aubergines...
- There's our bait, Phillip.

594
01:01:28,531 --> 01:01:33,195
All we have to do now is wait
for our fluffy friend to appear.

595
01:01:34,637 --> 01:01:38,038
Look over here, everyone!
It's Victor!

596
01:01:38,108 --> 01:01:40,474
- He's here!
- Our hero.

597
01:01:40,543 --> 01:01:42,067
Please, sir, kiss my baby.

598
01:01:42,145 --> 01:01:44,409
- Another time, perhaps.
- Kiss my potato.

599
01:01:44,481 --> 01:01:47,211
- Not now.
- Kiss my artichoke.

600
01:01:47,283 --> 01:01:48,682
- Look, just...
- Victor.

601
01:01:48,752 --> 01:01:50,344
Oampanula!

602
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:55,119
Victor, I have to know.
Did it suffer?

603
01:01:55,191 --> 01:01:59,059
Of course not, my dear.
Not yet, anyway.

604
01:01:59,162 --> 01:02:00,789
- Victor?
- Oy, you.

605
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:03,697
- Oonstable.
- Oareful with them capsicums.

606
01:02:03,767 --> 01:02:07,760
Listen, I don't want to cause panic,
but the beast isn't actually dead yet.

607
01:02:07,837 --> 01:02:10,704
- The beast isn't actually dead yet?
- What?

608
01:02:20,583 --> 01:02:21,880
Oops.

609
01:02:22,218 --> 01:02:24,846
To the competition stand!

610
01:02:40,804 --> 01:02:43,500
Oracking toast, Gromit.

611
01:02:45,508 --> 01:02:49,103
I'm just crackers about cheese.

612
01:02:50,447 --> 01:02:52,847
Monterey Jack.

613
01:03:05,295 --> 01:03:08,753
Smashing Wensleydale.

614
01:03:29,819 --> 01:03:32,344
Job well done, lad.

615
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:52,132
Quiet!

616
01:03:53,009 --> 01:03:54,738
Quiet!

617
01:03:58,314 --> 01:04:00,214
Now, listen carefully.

618
01:04:00,283 --> 01:04:03,184
I've only got two...

619
01:04:03,253 --> 01:04:05,653
I've only got one gold bullet left.

620
01:04:05,722 --> 01:04:08,122
So leave this to me.

621
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:11,558
Yes, all right, I admit
the beast is still at large.

622
01:04:11,628 --> 01:04:15,655
But the good news is your prize
vegetables are the perfect bait...

623
01:04:15,732 --> 01:04:16,721
Bait?

624
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:19,063
...and will draw the creature
like a magnet.

625
01:04:19,135 --> 01:04:20,659
- Keep still.
- My baby.

626
01:04:20,737 --> 01:04:24,605
- There, there, love. It'll be all...
- Don't even move a muscle.

627
01:04:24,674 --> 01:04:26,005
Mrs. Mulch! No!

628
01:04:26,976 --> 01:04:29,444
It's not getting my baby!

629
01:04:31,347 --> 01:04:35,181
Lovely food. For rabbits, that is.

630
01:04:39,522 --> 01:04:42,457
- Oome back!
- Oome back!

631
01:04:48,031 --> 01:04:51,558
Yes. Right on cue.

632
01:04:52,502 --> 01:04:54,629
Oome back!

633
01:04:58,107 --> 01:05:00,200
Go away!

634
01:05:00,276 --> 01:05:03,268
That's right. Oome to Uncle Victor.

635
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:11,009
It's coming for us!

636
01:05:19,462 --> 01:05:21,157
Bingo.

637
01:05:22,732 --> 01:05:24,359
What the...?

638
01:05:28,204 --> 01:05:30,229
Hurrah for Anti-Pesto!

639
01:05:30,306 --> 01:05:33,969
- It's getting away!
- Get off, you stupid...

640
01:05:34,043 --> 01:05:35,169
No!

641
01:05:41,985 --> 01:05:44,249
Vicar, I need more gold bullets.

642
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,618
They don't come cheap, you know.

643
01:05:56,332 --> 01:05:58,562
Victor? What are you doing?

644
01:05:58,668 --> 01:06:00,932
I need it, my sweet. Emergency.

645
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:05,407
- Victor, no! Please!
- Oome, now, Oampanula, let go.

646
01:06:05,475 --> 01:06:07,306
But it's my Golden Oarrot Award.

647
01:06:07,377 --> 01:06:09,345
This is hardly the time, my darling.

648
01:06:09,412 --> 01:06:11,642
- Give it to me this instant!
- But Victor!

649
01:06:13,716 --> 01:06:15,377
Oheese, Gromit.

650
01:06:20,657 --> 01:06:23,592
The Golden Oarrot belongs in the show!

651
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:26,823
No, the Golden Oarrot
belongs in the Were-Rabbit.

652
01:06:29,532 --> 01:06:30,863
Every man for himself!

653
01:06:30,933 --> 01:06:34,699
Help! Help! Help me!

654
01:06:34,771 --> 01:06:39,265
Put me down at once,
you great big hairy thing, you!

655
01:06:39,342 --> 01:06:41,105
Stop! Stop!

656
01:06:41,177 --> 01:06:44,908
Mob supplies!
Get your angry mob supplies here.

657
01:06:56,893 --> 01:06:59,862
Put her down, you great ugly brute!

658
01:07:04,434 --> 01:07:07,335
I'll bagsy the lucky rabbit's foot.

659
01:07:10,807 --> 01:07:13,537
Help me, someone! Help me!

660
01:07:16,813 --> 01:07:18,440
Yes.

661
01:07:31,227 --> 01:07:33,855
No. No, no, no!

662
01:07:52,382 --> 01:07:55,510
Put me down! Put me down, you...

663
01:07:55,585 --> 01:07:57,485
Whatever you are! Help!

664
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:02,284
What is it?

665
01:08:02,358 --> 01:08:06,158
What are you staring at
with those beastly eyes?

666
01:08:14,771 --> 01:08:16,261
Wallace.

667
01:08:40,329 --> 01:08:42,263
Oh, Wallace.

668
01:08:42,331 --> 01:08:45,027
What ever have you done to yourself?

669
01:08:45,868 --> 01:08:49,634
Well, don't you worry.
I'll protect you.

670
01:08:50,373 --> 01:08:55,743
Get your hairy mitts off
my future wife, you big brute.

671
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:58,838
No! Victor!

672
01:08:58,948 --> 01:09:01,314
You don't understand.
The hunt is off.

673
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:03,784
It's... We made a terrible mistake.

674
01:09:03,853 --> 01:09:06,253
No. You commissioned me
to rid you of Pesto,

675
01:09:06,322 --> 01:09:08,813
and that's just
what I intend to do.

676
01:09:10,493 --> 01:09:11,858
Pesto?

677
01:09:15,665 --> 01:09:18,998
Why, you knew
it was Wallace all along.

678
01:09:20,102 --> 01:09:21,535
Oh, all right.

679
01:09:21,604 --> 01:09:23,663
So what if it is that blithering idiot.

680
01:09:23,739 --> 01:09:25,639
No one will ever believe you.

681
01:09:28,511 --> 01:09:33,778
And if I can't have your money,
I can still bag your bunny.

682
01:09:39,622 --> 01:09:41,419
My eyes!

683
01:09:41,491 --> 01:09:43,925
Run, rabbit, run!

684
01:09:51,367 --> 01:09:53,301
I rather like your hair pinned back.

685
01:09:53,369 --> 01:09:55,667
No, Victor, no! Stop! Please!

686
01:09:55,738 --> 01:09:57,171
Victor!

687
01:09:57,874 --> 01:10:01,571
You can hop,
but you can't hide, Pesto.

688
01:10:15,091 --> 01:10:17,651
Beware the moon!

689
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,203
Stupid interfering mutt.

690
01:11:09,745 --> 01:11:12,908
Stand back! There may be
a large rabbit dropping!

691
01:11:30,666 --> 01:11:33,794
Looks like the buck stops here.

692
01:12:32,294 --> 01:12:35,525
Eat karat, bunny boy!

693
01:13:04,193 --> 01:13:05,785
Potty poo!

694
01:13:37,293 --> 01:13:40,729
No one beats Victor Quartermaine!

695
01:13:40,796 --> 01:13:42,821
Is that so?

696
01:13:43,833 --> 01:13:46,358
Oonsider yourself dumped.

697
01:13:53,209 --> 01:13:55,177
He's in there!

698
01:13:57,813 --> 01:14:01,044
- There he is!
- Surround him!

699
01:14:01,617 --> 01:14:03,744
There he is! Over there!

700
01:14:05,988 --> 01:14:08,582
Phillip, help me! Phillip!

701
01:14:08,657 --> 01:14:10,215
Do something.

702
01:14:12,328 --> 01:14:17,630
Destroy! Drive out the monstrosity!

703
01:14:23,506 --> 01:14:26,703
Well, let's see how he likes it.

704
01:14:28,644 --> 01:14:30,271
Wallace?

705
01:15:08,450 --> 01:15:10,441
Oh, Gromit.

706
01:15:11,053 --> 01:15:13,954
Well, at least now he's at peace.

707
01:15:14,023 --> 01:15:15,490
The rabbit's gone.

708
01:15:16,358 --> 01:15:20,260
If only there were a way
to bring back Wallace.

709
01:15:32,708 --> 01:15:35,472
Lovely cheese, Gromit.

710
01:15:39,114 --> 01:15:40,103
Gromit?

711
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:43,309
Don't forget the crackers.

712
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:52,127
Oheese?

713
01:15:56,832 --> 01:15:58,823
Oheese!

714
01:15:58,934 --> 01:16:02,131
It's me again. I'm back!

715
01:16:02,171 --> 01:16:05,163
Gromit! You clever mutt.

716
01:16:05,241 --> 01:16:08,142
Well done, old pal!

717
01:16:13,015 --> 01:16:16,542
- Totty!
- Wallace! You're...

718
01:16:19,255 --> 01:16:20,950
Thanks, lad.

719
01:16:22,558 --> 01:16:24,253
Oh, look!

720
01:16:26,862 --> 01:16:30,525
Well, I think
you deserve this, Gromit.

721
01:16:30,599 --> 01:16:34,501
For a brave and splendid melon.

722
01:16:35,204 --> 01:16:38,469
We've all got a lot to thank you for.

723
01:16:40,542 --> 01:16:43,033
Every dog has his day.

724
01:16:43,112 --> 01:16:44,875
And thank you, Wallace.

725
01:16:44,947 --> 01:16:48,815
You've saved me
from a terrible marriage.

726
01:16:49,785 --> 01:16:51,013
All the same,

727
01:16:51,086 --> 01:16:54,954
it is going to be rather lonely
at Tottington Hall now.

728
01:16:57,660 --> 01:16:59,423
Unless...

729
01:17:00,663 --> 01:17:04,224
I have a little proposal
for you, Wallace.

730
01:17:08,771 --> 01:17:12,605
I'm so thrilled you agreed
to go through with this.

731
01:17:12,675 --> 01:17:15,473
My pleasure, Totty.

732
01:17:16,278 --> 01:17:18,678
One for the album, Gromit.

733
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:29,050
I declare this bunny sanctuary
officially open.

734
01:17:33,329 --> 01:17:34,694
When you're ready, lad.

735
01:17:34,763 --> 01:17:38,324
Fire up the old BV6000.

736
01:17:47,776 --> 01:17:50,336
Oh, it's simply marvelous.

737
01:17:50,412 --> 01:17:55,816
My home, a safe haven
for all things fluffy.

738
01:18:02,424 --> 01:18:04,949
I do hope you'll still
come visit, Wallace.

739
01:18:05,027 --> 01:18:08,554
I'd rather got used to
having you around.

740
01:18:09,131 --> 01:18:11,224
There'll always be a part of me

741
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:14,167
here at Tottington Hall.

742
01:18:15,304 --> 01:18:17,772
Give it some more welly, lad.

743
01:18:27,182 --> 01:18:29,616
Oheese!
