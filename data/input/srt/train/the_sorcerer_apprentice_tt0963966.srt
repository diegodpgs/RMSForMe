Your ring is not a piece of jewelry.

484
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:27,410
lt projects the electrical energy
of your nervous system

485
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:29,150
into the physical world.

486
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,490
Without his ring,
a sorcerer is powerless.

487
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,490
The only other thing a sorcerer needs

488
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,690
is a nice pair of pointy shoes.

489
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,960
Your rubber soles block the current.

490
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,930
Plus it helps to look classy.

491
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,090
These are old man shoes.

492
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:50,400
Excuse me?

A lot.

l haven't seen that cane since l saw
a picture of it when l was a boy.

496

You've been locked up a long time.

And now l'm out.

499
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,030
l got one kid.

500
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,350
He ain't old school.

501
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:30,180
One will do.

502
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,510
Your ingenuity and your heart

503
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,640
will give you an advantage
over Morganians.

504

They rely only
on the power of their magic.

505
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:44,760
But if you're up against the wall,
there's only one weapon of choice,

506
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:46,560
the plasma bolt.

507
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,830
Nothing. There's nothing.

l'm going to emerge, right?

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,070
And everyone's going to think l'm me.

a tiger jumping out of a leopard.

that's been done, l'm sure, somewhere.

Sorry, are you lost?

So, you're what passes
for a Morganian these days.

you're some kind of entertainer.

Five sold-out shows at the Garden,
plus back end on the pay-per-view.

Did you ever see Morgana
pull a rabbit out of a hat?

537
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:46,210
Look, my master disappeared
when l was 1 5, vanished!

538
