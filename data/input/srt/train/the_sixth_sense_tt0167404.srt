1
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,600
It's getting cold.

2
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,100
That is one fine frame.

3
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,300
One fine frame that is.

4
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,500
- How much...

5
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,100
does a fine frame like that
cost, do you think?

6
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,100
I never told you, but you sound a little
like Dr. Seuss when you're drunk.

7
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,500
I know.
I'm serious.

8
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
Serious, I am.

9
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,300
I'd say it cost at least
a couple hundred.

10
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,900
- I'm gonna read it for you.
- Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?

11
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,100
"In recognition of his
outstanding achievement...

12
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,700
- " in the field of child psychology,
- Mm-hmm.

13
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,800
his dedication to his work
and his continuing efforts to
improve the quality of life-- "

14
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,300
- Will you concentrate?

15
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,700
"...his continuing efforts to
improve the quality of life...

16
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,600
"for countless children
and their families,

17
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,800
"the city of Philadelphia
proudly bestows upon its son...

18
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,600
Dr. Malcolm Crowe--"
That's you--

19
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,600
"...the Mayor's Citation
for professional excellence."

20
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,400
They called you their son.

21
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,200
Wow.

22
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,700
We should hang it
in the bathroom.

23
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,500
This is an important
night for us.

24
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,200
Finally, someone is recognizing
the sacrifices you've made--

25
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,800
that you have put everything
second, including me,

26
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,000
for those families that
they're talking about.

27
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,900
They're also saying that
my husband has a gift.

28
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
You have a gift
that teaches children...

29
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,000
- how to be strong in situations...

30
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,900
where most adults
would piss on themselves.

31
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,700
I believe
what they wrote is real.

32
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,900
Thank you.

33
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,200
- I would like some wine in a glass.
- Mm- hmm.

34
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,300
I would not like it
in a mug.

35
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,000
- I would not like it in a jug.

36
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,900
Look.

37
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,600
Anna, don't move.
Don't make a sound.

38
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,300
This is 47 Locus Street.

39
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You've broken a window
and entered a private residence.

40
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,800
You don't know so many things.

41
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:00,600
There are no needles or prescription
drugs of any kind in this house.

42
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,700
Do you know why you're afraid
when you're alone?

43
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,700
I do.
I do.

44
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,000
What do you want?

45
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,900
What he promised me!
I want what he promised me.

46
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,400
- Oh, my God.
- Do I know you?

47
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,100
Don't you know me, hero?

48
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,300
Don't you even remember
your own patients?

49
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,500
Downtown clinic.

50
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,000
Single- parent family.

51
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,300
Possible mood disorder.

52
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,900
I was afraid!

53
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:54,500
You told me I was having trouble
coping with my parents' divorce.

54
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,400
You were wrong.
You were wrong.

55
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,600
Now look at me!

56
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,100
- I don't want to be afraid no more.
- Just give me a minute to think.

57
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,400
I waited
ten years for you!

58
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,400
I'm not giving you nothing!

59
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,200
Ben Friedkin?

60
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,600
Some people,
they call me "freak."

61
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,800
Ryan Summer?

62
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,000
I am. I am a freak.
Look at--

63
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,200
Vincent.

64
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,200
Vincent Gray.

65
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,200
No, you don't.

66
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,700
I do remember you.

67
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,400
Quiet, very smart.

68
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,400
Compassionate.

69
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,600
Unusually compassionate.

70
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,800
You forgot cursed.

71
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,800
You failed me.

72
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,700
You failed me!

73
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,200
Vincent, I'm sorry if I wasn't--
if I didn't help you.

74
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,100
But if you just let me try,

75
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,400
if you just
give me a chance--

76
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,100
Oh, God! Oh, God!

77
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,100
- Did Vincent--
- Don't talk. Shh.

78
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,800
It's okay, Cole.

79
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,600
My name is Dr. Malcolm Crowe.

80
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,200
We were supposed to meet today,
but I missed our appointment.

81
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,200
I'm sorry.

82
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:23,000
You know, in the olden days in Europe,
people used to hide out in churches.

83
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,400
They would claim sanctuary.

84
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,400
What were they hiding from?

85
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,300
Bad people, mostly.

86
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,900
People that wanted to
put them in jail, hurt them.

87
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,200
I noticed your eyeglasses.
They don't have any lenses in them.

88
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,400
They're my dad's.

89
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,000
The lenses hurt my eyes.

90
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,000
What were you talking about with your
soldiers when I came in? Day--

91
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,900
Deprofundus clamo
adite domine.

92
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,900
It's called " Latin."

93
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,900
- All your soldiers speak Latin?
- No.

94
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,900
Just one.

95
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,400
Are you a good doctor?

96
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,900
Well,

97
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,900
I used to be.

98
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,300
I won an award once
from the mayor.

99
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,700
It had an expensive frame.

100
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,900
I'm gonna see you again,
right?

101
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,700
If that's okay with you.

102
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,500
It's me.

103
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,300
The turnpike westbound
slows at Valley Forge 24.

104
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,700
On the Blue Ridge,
both directions generally slow
between number three and two--

105
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,700
Hey, good morning.

106
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,200
Cole.

107
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,500
Cole!

108
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,200
Hey, your Cocoa Puffs
are gettin' soggy.

109
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,500
Let me see you.
Oh, honey, you got a spot.

110
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,500
Head up.

111
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,400
- Okay, here we go.

112
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,600
Something you were
looking for, baby?

113
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,500
Pop Tarts?

114
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
They're right here.

115
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,800
Oh.

116
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,300
Well, what are you
thinking, Mama?

117
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,300
Lots of things.

118
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,600
Anything bad about me?

119
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,600
Hey, look at my face.

120
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,400
I was not thinking
something bad about you.

121
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,500
Got it?

122
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Got it.

123
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,200
- Here, head up.

124
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,400
- That's Tommy.
- That's okay. You tuck it in.

125
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,000
Cole, you want this?

126
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,800
Hey, freak, how'd you like that
"arm around the shoulder" bit?

127
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,500
I just made that up.
I went with it.

128
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,200
It's what great actors do.
It's called "improv."

129
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,300
Hey, baby.

130
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,300
How was your day?

131
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,600
Hmm?

132
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,200
You know, you can tell me things
If you need to.

133
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,700
Well, you know
what I did today?

134
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,900
I, uh, I won the Pennsylvania Lottery
in the morning,

135
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,900
I quit my jobs,

136
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,900
and I ate a big picnic in the park
with lots of chocolate mousse pie.

137
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,400
And then I swam
in the fountain all afternoon.

138
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,400
What'd you do?

139
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,300
I was picked first for
kick ball teams at recess.

140
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,300
I hit a grand slam
to win the game.

141
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,400
Everybody lifted me up
on their shoulders
and carried me around, cheering.

142
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,300
Well, in that case, I am gonna
make you some triangle pancakes.

143
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,400
You got an hour.

144
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,400
Hi.

145
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,800
Wanna sit?

146
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,600
Don't feel like
talking today?

147
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,300
Wanna play a game?

148
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,300
It's a mind- reading game.

149
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,400
Here's how it works.

150
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,900
I read your mind.

151
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,200
If what I say is right, you take
one step towards the chair.

152
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:14,300
If what I say is wrong,
you take one step back...

153
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,300
towards the doorway.

154
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,000
If you reach the chair,
you sit down.

155
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,900
If you reach the door,
you can go.

156
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,400
Wanna play?

157
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,600
Okay.

158
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,700
When your mother and father
were first divorced,

159
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:00,100
your mom went to see a doctor
like me, and he didn't help her.

160
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,300
So you think I'm not going
to be able to help you.

161
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:24,000
You're worried that she said
she told him things--

162
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,400
things she couldn't tell
anyone else.

163
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,700
Secrets.

164
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,100
You have a secret,
but you don't want to tell me.

165
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,600
Your dad gave you that watch
as a present just before he went away.

166
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,800
He forgot it in a drawer.

167
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,800
Doesn't work.

168
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,300
You keep pretty quiet
in school, but...

169
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:32,200
you're a good student, you've never
really been in any serious trouble.

170
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,500
We were supposed
to draw a picture.

171
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,700
Anything we wanted.

172
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,600
I drew a man.

173
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,700
He got hurt in the neck by
another man with a screwdriver.

174
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,000
You saw that on TV, Cole?

175
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,000
Everyone got upset.

176
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,800
They had a meeting.

177
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,800
Mom started crying.

178
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,400
I don't draw
like that anymore.

179
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
How do you draw now?

180
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,300
I draw... people smiling,

181
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,400
dogs running,

182
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,700
rainbows.

183
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,000
They don't have meetings
about rainbows.

184
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,400
No. I guess they don't.

185
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,900
What am I thinking now?

186
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,500
I don't know
what you're thinking now.

187
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,700
I was thinking...

188
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,700
you're nice,

189
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,200
but you can't help me.

190
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,400
I thought you meant the other Italian
restaurant I asked you to marry me in.

191
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,500
I'm so sorry, Anna.

192
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,600
I just can't seem
to keep track of time.

193
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,300
And I didn't have
a very good session today.

194
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,500
They're both so similar.

195
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,000
The same mannerisms, same expressions,
same things hanging over their head.

196
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,900
I think it might be
some kind of abuse.

197
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,400
Cole has...
scratches on his arm.

198
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,100
I think they might be
fingernail cuts.

199
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,500
Defensive cuts, maybe.
I don't know.

200
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,500
Maybe a teacher or a neighbor.

201
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:23,300
I don't think it's the mother.
I've seen her with him,
and it doesn't seem to fit.

202
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,700
Or I could just be wrong.

203
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,800
Maybe he's just a kid
who likes to climb trees a lot.

204
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,400
Anna.

205
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,800
I know that I've been
a little distant, all right?

206
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,100
I know that it makes you mad.
I just...

207
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,200
feel like I'm being given
a second chance, and
I don't want it to slip away.

208
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,500
- Anna.

209
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,400
Happy anniversary.

210
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,100
Stop looking at me.

211
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,100
I don't like when people
look at me like that.

212
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,700
- Okay.

213
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,800
I walk this way to school
with Tommy Tammisimo.

214
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,800
Is he your best buddy?

215
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,800
He hates me.

216
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,300
Do you hate him?

217
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,500
No.

218
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,200
Did your mom
set that up?

219
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,200
Yes.

220
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,500
Did you ever talk to your mom
about how things are with Tommy?

221
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,700
- I don't tell her things.
- Why not?

222
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,500
'Cause she doesn't look at me like
everybody else, and I don't want her to.

223
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,300
- I don't want her to know.
- Know what?

224
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,800
That I'm a freak.

225
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,000
Hey.

226
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:59,000
You are not a freak.
Okay?

227
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:03,900
Don't you believe anybody that tries to
convince you of that. That's bullshit.

228
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,400
You don't have to go through
your life believing that.

229
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,000
Okay?

230
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Come on.

231
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,700
- You said the "S" word.
- Yeah, I know.

232
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,700
Sorry.

233
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,200
So your dad lives
in Pittsburgh with a lady...

234
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,600
that works in a tollbooth?

235
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,100
I wonder if she has to pee
when she's working.

236
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,200
Think she just holds it?

237
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,600
I don't know. I was just
thinking about that myself.

238
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,400
You asked a lot of questions
about Dad today.

239
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,700
How come?

240
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,500
Well, sometimes we do things
to draw attention,

241
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:01,700
to express our feelings
about certain issues--

242
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,200
divorce, whatever.

243
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,000
For example, a person might
leave something on the desk
for someone else to find.

244
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,100
Do you know what free
association writing is, Cole?

245
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,400
No.

246
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,800
Free association writing
is when you take a pencil in your hand,

247
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:29,200
and you put the pencil to apiece
of paper and you start writing.

248
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,000
And you don't look
at what you're writing or
think about what you're writing.

249
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,400
You just keep
Your hand moving.

250
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:39,500
And after a while, if you keep
Your hand moving long enough,

251
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,000
words and thoughts start coming out that
you didn't even know you had in you.

252
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:48,500
It could be something
you heard somewhere else,

253
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,900
or feelings you had
deep inside of you.

254
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,100
Have you ever done any
free association writing, Cole?

255
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,900
Yes.

256
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,000
What did you write?

257
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,500
Upset words.

258
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:14,700
Did you ever write any upset words
before your father left?

259
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,000
I don't remember.

260
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,100
Can you do something for me?

261
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,400
I want you to think about what you
wanna get out of our time together--

262
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,400
what our goal should be.

263
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,500
Something I want?

264
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,000
If you could change something
in your life, anything at all,

265
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,000
what would it be?

266
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,400
Instead of something I want,
can it be something I don't want?

267
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,000
Okay.

268
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,600
I don't want to be
scared anymore.

269
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,900
You gonna get that?

270
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,000
Are you gonna get that?

271
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

272
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,500
- Don't you see enough of me
at the store?
- Yeah, I'm on my way out...

273
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,500
to the flea market
in the Amish country.

274
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,500
I thought maybe you'd
wanna come along...

275
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,300
and show me how to buy
at one of these things.

276
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,100
I don't know if I can deal
with the Amish today.

277
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,800
You can't curse or spit
or anything around them.

278
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,800
I just figured maybe you'd just want to
get out and get some air,

279
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,200
because you've seemed
kind of down lately.

280
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,200
Um, I'm okay.

281
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,900
Do you think that maybe I should stop by
on the way back, show you what I got?

282
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,300
Because that
wouldn't be a problem.

283
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,800
No, I- You know,
I can see on Monday.

284
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,900
Sure, yeah, that's fine.
I'm just--

285
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,600
Okay, so I guess I'm gonna get going
then. I'll speak to you later.

286
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,500
- Don't step in the horse manure.
- Thank you very much.

287
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,100
Keep moving, cheese dick.

288
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,600
Can anybody guess what city was capital
of the United States of America...

289
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:53,000
from 1 790 to 1 800?

290
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,600
I'll give you a hint:
It's the city you live in.

291
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,600
- Philadelphia!
- Right, right.

292
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,200
Philadelphia's one of the oldest cities
in this country.

293
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,600
A lot of generations
have lived here and died here.

294
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:12,300
Almost any place you go in this city
has a history and a story behind it.

295
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,400
Even this school
and the grounds it sits on.

296
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:20,100
Can anyone guess what this building
was used for a hundred years ago...

297
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,000
before you went to school here,
before I went to this school even?

298
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,500
Yes, Cole.

299
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,900
They used to hang people here.

300
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,300
No, uh, that--Mm- mm. That's
not correct. Where'd you hear that?

301
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:51,400
They pulled the people in, crying
and kissing their families bye.

302
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:55,400
People watching...
spit at them.

303
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,500
Uh, Cole, this building
was a legal courthouse.

304
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,000
Laws were passed here--some of
the very first laws of this country.

305
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,300
This whole building
was full of, uh, lawyers,

306
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,600
- lawmakers.
- They were the ones
that hanged everybody.

307
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,800
Uh--

308
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,600
I don't know which one
of these guys told you that,

309
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,800
but, uh, they were
Just trying to scare you.

310
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,600
I don't like people
looking at me like that.

311
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,900
Like what?

312
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,100
Stop it!

313
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,600
I, uh, I- I- I don't know
how else to look.

314
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,900
You're Stuttering Stanley!

315
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,700
- Excuse me?
- You talked funny when
you went to school here.

316
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,600
You talked funny
all the way to high school.

317
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:58,800
- What?
- You shouldn't look at people.
It makes them feel bad.

318
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,800
- How did you--
- Stop looking at me!

319
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,800
Who have you--[Stammering]
been speaking to?

320
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,500
Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley!

321
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,800
- Stop it. St- St- St--
- Stuttering Stanley!

322
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,600
- Stop that!
- Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley!

323
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,700
Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley!

324
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,200
Shut up, you f- f- freak!

325
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,200
Hey, big guy.

326
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
How's it goin'?

327
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,200
I don't wanna talk about
anything right now.

328
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,200
Okay.

329
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,600
You like magic?

330
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,600
Hmm?

331
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,700
Observe:
The magic penny.

332
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,000
Looks like
an ordinary penny.

333
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,600
But I do my little
magic shake, and...

334
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,100
now it's in my right hand.

335
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,100
But that's not the end
of the magic trick.

336
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,400
I do another
little shake, and...

337
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,600
right there
in the vest pocket.

338
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,600
But that's not the end
of the magic trick.

339
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,200
I do another little shake...

340
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,200
and...

341
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,800
right back in the left hand
where it started.

342
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,400
That isn't magic.

343
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,300
What are you talking about?
Of course it's magic.

344
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,000
You just kept the penny
in that hand the whole time.

345
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,700
Think so?

346
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,300
I didn't know you were funny.

347
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,100
Malcolm, sit your cute
butt down and listen up.

348
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,100
No doubt about it.
Anna is like my sister.

349
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,300
And you better make her happy.
I'm not talkin' about no...

350
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,800
"Mmm, this taste like
real butter" kind of happy.

351
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,800
I'm talkin' about--
What's up, girl?

352
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,500
"Julie Andrews
twirling around like...

353
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,000
a mental patient on a mountaintop"
kind of happy.

354
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:50,300
That's the kind of happy
I'm talkin' about.

355
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,300
Shh. Come here.

356
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,900
Don't tell her I told you,

357
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,400
but she said
she knew she love you...

358
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,300
from the first time
she met you on the street.

359
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,900
She´d do anything for you.

360
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,900
I love you guys.

361
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,800
My nose is running.
Turn it--

362
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,400
And then you do
the magic shake.

363
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,900
The penny has moved
from my pocket...

364
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,100
all the way back
to the hand it started in.

365
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,900
That's stupid.

366
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,500
It's supposed
to be funny.

367
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,900
It's stupid.
I want my penny back.

368
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,000
He doesn't get
invited places, so it's our pleasure.

369
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,600
Last time was a Chuck E. Cheese
party a year ago.

370
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:07,800
He hid in one of those purple plastic
tunnels and didn't come out.

371
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,900
- Chucky who?
- Cheese. It's a kids place.

372
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,900
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

373
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,600
Is someone out there?

374
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,000
Open this door, please.
Come on.

375
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:59,000
I can't breathe.
If you can hear me, open this door.

376
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:03,200
I swear on my life I didn't
take the master's horse.

377
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:07,000
Open this door, or I'll
break through it and grab you!

378
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:11,600
- The star of the commercial
always gets his own trailer.
- For what?

379
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,800
He needs a place to think
about his character, alone.

380
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,100
- You only had one line.

381
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,900
Derrick, check it out.

382
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,200
Oh, yeah.

383
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,600
My dad
made me invite him.

384
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,500
Happy birthday, Derrick.

385
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,700
Is there somethin'
you want to see in there?

386
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,200
No.

387
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,400
We're gonna put on
a pretend play.

388
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:01,600
- Wanna be in it?
- Okay.

389
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,200
It's called
" Locked in the Dungeon."

390
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,600
Yes, Cole, and, uh, you get to be
the one locked in the dungeon.

391
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,600
Don't! Don't!
Don't! Don't!

392
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,300
Don´t!

393
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,200
Let me out! No! No!

394
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,600
No! No!

395
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,900
- Cole?

396
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,600
- Cole!

397
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,600
Is there a key
for this door?

398
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,600
Cole? Honey?
Honey, can you hear me?

399
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,900
Oh, my God! Cole!

400
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:10,500
Help me! Help!
Help! Help!

401
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,000
The tests would indicate
he did not have a seizure.

402
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,500
He's doing fine.

403
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,000
After some rest,
he can go home tonight.

404
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:39,700
There's some cuts and
bruises on your son...

405
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,800
- that are concerning me.
- Oh, man.

406
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,900
Yeah, those are from sports.

407
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,900
You think I hurt my child?

408
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,700
You think I'm a bad mother?

409
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:03,800
Mrs. Sloan over there,

410
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,400
she's a social worker
with the hospital.

411
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,300
She's gonna ask you a couple
procedural questions.

412
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,900
What happened
to my child today?

413
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,300
Something was happening to him,
physically happening.
Something was very wrong!

414
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,700
Hey.

415
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,400
Did your father used to
tell you bedtime stories?

416
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,100
Once upon a time
there was this young prince,

417
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:56,900
and he decided that
he wanted to go for a drive.

418
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:02,000
He go this driver,
and they started driving.

419
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:05,200
Driving, driving.

420
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,700
Driving a lot.

421
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,400
And, uh,

422
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,100
they drove so much
that he fell asleep.

423
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,100
And--

424
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:23,200
Then he woke up, and he realized
they were still driving.

425
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,600
- This was a very long trip.
- Dr. Crowe?

426
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,100
You haven't told
bedtime stories before.

427
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,400
Uh, not too many, no.

428
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:35,000
You have to add
some twists and stuff.

429
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,900
Okay. Some twists.

430
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,800
Like what kind of twists?
Give me an example.

431
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:49,200
- Maybe they run out of gas.
- They run out of gas?

432
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,300
That's good, 'cause they're driving,
right? Okay, so--

433
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,800
Tell me the story
about why you're sad.

434
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,700
You think I'm sad?

435
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,600
What makes you think that?

436
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,800
Your eyes told me.

437
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,200
Not supposed to talk
about stuff like that.

438
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,700
Once upon a time, there was
this person named Malcolm.

439
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,200
He worked with children.

440
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,400
He loved it.

441
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,500
He loved it
more than anything else.

442
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,900
And then one night,
he found out that...

443
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,200
he made a mistake
with one of them.

444
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,800
He couldn't help that one.

445
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,000
And he can't stop
thinking about it.

446
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,400
He can't forget.

447
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,900
Ever since then,
things have been different.

448
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,600
He's not the same person
that he used to be.

449
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,700
And his wife...

450
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,500
doesn't like the person
that he's become.

451
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,200
They barely speak anymore.
They're like strangers.

452
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:22,300
And then one day, Malcolm meets
this wonderful little boy.

453
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,000
A really cool little boy.

454
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,700
Reminds him a lot
of the other one.

455
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:34,500
And Malcolm decides
to try and help this new boy...

456
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:41,100
'cause he feels that
if he can help this new boy,

457
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,900
it will be like...
helping that other one too.

458
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,100
How does the story end?

459
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,900
I don't know.

460
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:15,300
I wanna tell you
my secret now.

461
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,900
Okay.

462
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,500
I see dead people.

463
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,100
I n your dreams?

464
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,300
While you're awake?

465
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:49,700
Dead people, like,
in graves, in coffins?

466
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,000
Walking around
like regular people.

467
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:56,700
They don't see each other.

468
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,500
They only see
what they wanna see.

469
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:03,700
They don't know they're dead.

470
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,600
How often do you see them?

471
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,500
All the time.

472
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,000
They're everywhere.

473
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,900
You won't tell anyone
my secret, right?

474
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,400
No. I promise.

475
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,400
Will you stay here
until I fall asleep?

476
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,000
Of course.

477
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:51,600
Cole has pathologies
more severe than initially assessed.

478
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:55,600
He's suffering from
visual hallucinations,

479
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,400
- paranoia,

480
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,600
some kind of...
school- age schizophrenia.

481
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:08,000
Medication, hospitalization
may be required.

482
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,700
And I'm not helping him.

483
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,800
Hi, this is Lynn Sear,
Cole's mom.

484
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,100
Yeah, uh, I--
I'd like to talk to you...

485
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:56,000
about your boy and his friends keeping
their goddamn hands off my son.

486
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,000
Mama?

487
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,600
No, dinner
is not ready!

488
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,300
What are you
gonna do?

489
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,800
You can't hurt me
anymore!

490
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:49,200
Neddy! You're a terrible
husband, Neddy!

491
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:52,300
Look what you made me do!
Neddy!

492
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,000
Once there was a boy,

493
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,600
very different
from all the other boys.

494
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:20,600
He lived in the jungle,

495
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:24,300
and he could speak
to the animals.

496
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,800
Did you think the play
sucked big time?

497
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:44,100
What?

498
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,600
Tommy Tammisimo acted
in a cough syrup commercial.

499
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:50,400
He said everyone was self- conscious
and unrealistic.

500
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,600
He said the play
sucked big time.

501
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,300
This Tommy kid sounds
like a real punk.

502
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:01,100
I thought the play was excellent.
Better than "Cats. "

503
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,700
- "Cats"?
- Never mind.

504
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:09,600
Cole, I was really interested
in what you told me at the hospital.

505
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:12,300
I'd like to hear
more about it.

506
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,800
Cole?

507
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,700
What?

508
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,200
Is something
up there?

509
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,700
Cole,

510
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,900
I don't
see anything.

511
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:03,900
Be real still.

512
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,600
Sometimes you
feel it inside,

513
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,500
like you're falling down
real fast,

514
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:15,500
but you're really
Just standing still.

515
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:24,400
You ever feel the prickly things
on the back of your neck?

516
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:27,300
Yes.

517
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:31,300
And the tiny hairs on your arm,
you know, when they stand up?

518
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:34,000
Yes.

519
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,400
That's them.

520
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,300
When they get mad,

521
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,800
it gets cold.

522
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:10,100
I don't see anything.
Are you sure they're there?

523
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,200
Cole?

524
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,800
Please make them leave.

525
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,300
I'm workin' on it.

526
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,700
Come on.

527
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,300
Aah!

528
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:13,600
Mommy, Daddy?

529
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:18,200
My throat hurts.

530
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,600
Run! Run!

531
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,000
Pedia Ease
cough suppressant.

532
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:36,400
- Gentle, fast, effect--
- Cole.

533
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:40,500
I don't care what they say,
this thing is broken.

534
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,900
Take 'em off.

535
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:57,200
I don't want them
on my table.

536
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,700
I saw what was in your bureau drawer
when I was cleaning.

537
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,700
Got something
you want to confess?

538
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:13,400
Hmm?
The bumblebee pendant?

539
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:16,000
Why do you
keep taking it?

540
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:22,000
It was Grandma's.

541
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,200
You know, what if it broke?
You know how sad I'd be.

542
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:30,200
You'd cry 'cause you
miss Grandma so much.

543
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,100
That's right.

544
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:41,400
Sometimes people think
they lose things,

545
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:47,000
and they really didn't lose them--
it just gets moved.

546
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:49,400
So, did you move
the bumblebee pendant?

547
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:00,000
Don't get mad.

548
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,100
So, who moved it
this time?

549
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:05,800
Maybe someone came in our house,
took the bumblebee pendant
out of my closet...

550
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:08,200
and placed it nicely
in your drawer.

551
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,800
- Maybe.
- [Sighs] God, I am so tired, Cole.

552
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,400
I'm tired in my body,
I'm tired in my mind,

553
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,400
I'm... tired
in my heart.

554
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:20,600
I need some help.

555
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:24,900
You know, I don't know if you
noticed, but our little family
isn't doing so good.

556
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,900
I mean,
I've been praying,

557
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,100
but I must not
be praying right.

558
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:33,000
Looks like we're just gonna have to
answer each other's prayers.

559
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:39,500
If we can't talk to each other,
we're not gonna make it.

560
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:46,900
Now, tell me, baby.
I- I- I won't get mad, honey.

561
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,600
Did you take
the bumblebee pendant?

562
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:00,600
- No.

563
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:05,100
You've had enough roast beef.
You need to leave the table.

564
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,900
Go!

565
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:37,700
Hey, come on. I'll show you where
my dad keeps his gun. Come on.

566
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:46,500
Sebastian, come on!

567
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:50,700
- Mama?

568
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:57,800
If you're not
very mad,

569
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,500
can I sleep
in your bed tonight?

570
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:04,900
Look at my face.

571
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,800
I'm not very mad.

572
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:14,600
- Baby, why are you shaking?

573
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,000
Cole, what's wrong?

574
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:21,900
Oh, God,
please tell me!

575
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,400
Oh, please.

576
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,200
Oh.

577
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:41,200
It's Edwardian,
beautifully worked...

578
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:46,400
with mine- cut diamonds
and an actual color Burmese sapphire.

579
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:49,100
It's timeless.

580
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,600
- Oh.

581
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,100
You, uh...

582
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,900
got anything
a little plainer?

583
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,700
Plainer? You want a plain ring
to go with your plain fiance?
Is that how it is?

584
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:05,700
No! Baby,
don't get in a tissy.

585
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:12,600
Uh--
You're so beautiful.

586
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:16,400
You're like a Burmese sapphire
all by yourself.

587
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:19,300
- You don't need all that.
- Uh- huh.

588
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,800
Why don't you
try it on...

589
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:24,200
and see how you both
feel about it.

590
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:33,000
There. How does
that feel?

591
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:37,300
I think this piece,
um, communicates a longing.

592
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,400
I imagine that the woman
who owned it...

593
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:43,600
loved a man that she
couldn't be with.

594
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:48,200
Did he have wavy hair
and chestnut eyes?

595
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:52,400
- Huh?
- Um, I don't know, but...

596
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:55,400
a lot of the pieces
in this store communicate,

597
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:59,000
and I think you should choose
a piece that speaks to you.

598
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:05,200
I think maybe when people own things
and then they pass away,

599
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:08,800
a part of themselves gets
printed on those things,

600
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:12,500
like...
like fingerprints.

601
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,700
I'll just
wrap it up.

602
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,900
You don't need a guy
with a Master's.

603
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,700
You need a wrestler with a neck
larger than his head.

604
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:32,000
No, I need a wrestler with a Master´s.

605
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:35,700
- What's this?
- Happy birthday.

606
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:38,100
- For me?
- Mm- hmm.

607
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:49,800
It's a...
first edition.

608
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:52,300
- Wow.

609
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:55,200
- You know, this is too much.
- No.

610
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:57,300
Took it out of
your Christmas bonus.

611
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:01,600
It´s perfect, Anna.

612
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:05,200
- Thanks.

613
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:12,600
What do you want
more than anything?

614
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,900
I don't know.

615
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:17,700
- I've told you what I want.

616
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,400
I know what I want.

617
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:27,300
I want to be able to
talk to my wife again.

618
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:33,000
The way we used to
talk to each other.

619
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,700
Like there was no one else
in the world except us.

620
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,800
How are you gonna do that?

621
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:47,300
Can't be your doctor
anymore.

622
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:51,900
I haven't paid enough
attention to my family.

623
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,100
Bad things happen
when you do that.

624
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:58,200
Do you understand?

625
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:02,200
- I'm going to transfer you.
I know two psychologists.
- Don't fail me.

626
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,400
Don't give up. You're the only one
who can help me, I know it.

627
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:11,900
- I can't help you.
- [Sobbing]

628
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
You--

629
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,100
Someone else
can help you.

630
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
You believe me, right?

631
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:30,900
Dr. Crowe, you believe
my secret, right?

632
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:35,900
I don't know how
to answer that, Cole.

633
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:49,100
How can you help me...

634
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:51,800
if you don't believe me?

635
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:59,600
Some magic's real.

636
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:18,900
Do you know why you're
afraid when you're alone?

637
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,900
I do.
I do.

638
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:34,200
I´m sorry, Vincent. I hope I
didn´t leave you alone too long.

639
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:37,500
Whew.
It's cold in here.

640
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:43,600
Vincent,
why are you crying?

641
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:51,000
You won´t believe.

642
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:00,400
Sorry, Vincent. I hope
I didn't leave you alone too long.

643
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:03,700
Whew.
It's coldin here.

644
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:09,500
- Vincent--

645
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:13,800
Whew.
It's cold in here.

646
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:22,800
- Nah, you know what?
I never liked him either.

647
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,400
When I was a kid,
I had this blood test done,

648
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:29,900
- and I threw up chili cheese
fries allover this male nurse.

649
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:34,000
Excuse me.
Dr. Reed is on line two.

650
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:36,800
Vincent, will you
excuse me? I have to take this.

651
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:39,100
- Just give me a minute, okay?
- Okay.

652
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:56,600
No entiendes.

653
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:59,300
Yo no quiero morir.

654
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,400
Yo no quiero morir.

655
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,400
- Oh, my God.
- Yo no quiero morir!

656
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:21,100
You been
running around?

657
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,600
Make you
feel better?

658
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,600
I like to run around.
It's good exercise.

659
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,500
Do you want to ask me
questions now?

660
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:41,300
Want to be a lance corporal in Company
"M" Third Battalion, Seventh Marines?

661
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:44,400
We're being dispatched
into the Quang Nam province.

662
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,900
Maybe later.

663
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:51,200
Something happened,
didn't it?

664
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,900
You wiggling out?

665
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:01,500
Yes.
I think I am.

666
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:07,500
Do you know what
"Yo no quiero morir" means?

667
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,000
It's Spanish.
It means "I don't want to die. "

668
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:16,300
What do you think these ghosts want
when they talk to you?

669
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,500
I want you to
think about it, Cole.

670
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:31,600
I want you to think about it
really carefully.

671
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:34,400
What do you think
they want?

672
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:42,500
- Just help.
- That's right. That's what I think too.

673
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:45,000
They just want help,
even the scary ones.

674
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,300
I think I might know a way
to make them go away.

675
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:51,200
How?

676
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:53,700
Listen to them.

677
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:57,400
What if they
don't want help?

678
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:00,900
What if they're just angry and they
Just want to hurt somebody?

679
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,300
I don't think
that's the way it works.

680
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:06,100
How do you know
for sure?

681
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:10,200
I don't.

682
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:32,600
- Hey!

683
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:35,600
- Hey! Hey!

684
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,200
What's happening?

685
01:14:56,300 --> 01:15:00,500
What´s happening?

686
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:05,200
Go!

687
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,700
What's happening
to you?

688
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:23,000
Is someone hurting you?
I'll kick their ass.

689
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:26,300
Cole, if they're
hurting you--

690
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:41,800
Mama, you sleep now.

691
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:51,200
I'm feeling
much better now.

692
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,600
Do you want to
tell me something?

693
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,300
She came a long way
to visit me, didn't she?

694
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:41,500
I guess she did.

695
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,600
Can you get
some water?

696
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,400
That's her sister.

697
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:57,500
You know, when I went through this
with my father's cancer--

698
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,900
I just can't imagine a child
being in bed for two years.

699
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,500
How many--
How many doctors?

700
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,500
- I think it was six.
- Six different doctors?

701
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:09,000
I think so, yes.

702
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:19,300
I just heard the, uh,
little one is falling ill now.

703
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:21,700
God help them.

704
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,700
Don't go home,
okay?

705
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:46,200
I definitely won't.

706
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:44,100
Aah!
[Panting]

707
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:47,000
Mister?

708
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,400
Excuse me, mister.

709
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:59,200
Are you
Kyra's daddy?

710
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:16,200
It's for you.

711
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:19,400
Sh- She wanted
to tell you something.

712
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:00,000
Oh, no, here he comes.
He's coming my way. Psst!

713
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:07,500
Would you like to dance?

714
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:11,600
Well, actually,
I just came with my friends.

715
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:14,100
Oh, well,
how about this?

716
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:17,600
We can dance for a little bit,
and if you don't like the way I dance,

717
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:19,700
you can kick me.

718
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,800
Oh, okay then.

719
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:36,100
It's time for lunch, Kyra.

720
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:42,900
- I'm feeling much better now.
- That's so great, honey.

721
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,300
It´s time for your food.

722
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:49,600
Can I go outside
if I eat this?

723
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:52,000
I don't know. You know how
you get sick in the afternoons.

724
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:54,900
We'll see.

725
01:25:56,500 --> 01:26:00,400
Don't say that it tastes funny.
You know I don't like to hear that.

726
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:07,300
Tami's mom called.

727
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:25,100
You were
keeping her sick.

728
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,700
You liked it,
she said.

729
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:50,800
She looked out
for you.

730
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:53,200
Is Kyra coming back?

731
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:59,200
Not anymore.

732
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:08,500
I think that's enough.
That's enough makeup.

733
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:11,200
Okay.

734
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:14,900
- They're calling for the stable boy.
- We have to hurry!

735
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,700
Who, uh--
Who were you talking to?

736
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:30,700
Just practicing
my lines.

737
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:36,600
Thanks for giving me this part,
Mr. Cunningham.

738
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:40,400
You know, when I went to school
here, there was a terrible fire
in this section of the theater.

739
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,500
They rebuilt
the whole thing.

740
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:45,500
Yeah, I know.

741
01:27:55,700 --> 01:28:00,600
Only he who is pure of heart
can take the sword from the stone.

742
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:03,300
Let the boy try.

743
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,500
He is a stable boy.
He cleans up after the horses.

744
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:16,300
- Silence, village idiot.

745
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:19,200
Let the boy
step forward.

746
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:49,500
Hail, King Arthur!

747
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:56,100
Yea!

748
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:24,500
I thought you were
really great in the play, Cole.

749
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:26,700
- Really?
- Yeah.

750
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:29,200
- You know what else?
- What?

751
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:33,700
I thought Tommy Tammisimo
sucked big time.

752
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:44,300
I got an idea how you can talk
to your wife.

753
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:47,600
Wait till
she's asleep.

754
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:51,200
Then she'll listen to you
and she won't even know it.

755
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:01,800
I'm not gonna see you
anymore, am I?

756
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:06,700
I think we said everything
we needed to say.

757
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:11,200
Maybe it's time to say things
to someone closer to you.

758
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:16,300
Maybe we can pretend like we're
gonna see each other tomorrow.

759
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:21,000
Just for pretend.

760
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:29,600
Okay.

761
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:36,300
I'm gonna go now.

762
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,700
I'll see you
tomorrow, Cole.

763
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:15,500
I'm okay, Officer.
I- I'm okay.

764
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,800
I don't know
what happened.

765
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:26,100
Hmm.

766
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:29,300
Geez, I hope
nobody got hurt.

767
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:35,600
You're very quiet.

768
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:39,000
You're mad I missed
the play, aren't you?

769
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:41,500
I have two jobs, baby.

770
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:44,500
You know how important
they are for us.

771
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:49,000
I'd give anything
to have been there.

772
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:03,200
I'm ready to communicate
with you now.

773
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,500
Communicate?

774
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,400
Tell you my secrets.

775
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,400
What is it?

776
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:25,000
You know the accident
up there?

777
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:28,100
Yeah.

778
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:30,200
Someone got hurt.

779
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:32,500
They did?

780
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:36,100
A lady.

781
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:38,500
She died.

782
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:41,000
Oh, my God.
What, you can see her?

783
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:45,600
- Yes.
- Where is she?

784
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:53,000
Standing next to
my window.

785
01:32:59,100 --> 01:33:02,100
Cole, you're
scaring me.

786
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:04,500
They scare me too
sometimes.

787
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:09,400
They?

788
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:14,200
Ghosts.

789
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:21,000
You see ghosts, Cole?

790
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:26,100
They want me to
do things for them.

791
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:31,000
They--
They talk to you?

792
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:34,200
They tell you
to do things?

793
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:38,200
They're the ones
that used to hurt me.

794
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:42,500
What are you
thinking, Mama?

795
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:47,200
- You think I'm a freak?
- Look at my face.

796
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:50,200
I would never think that
about you. Ever.

797
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:54,000
- Got it?
- Got it.

798
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:03,300
Just let me think
for a minute.

799
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,300
Grandma says hi.

800
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:15,900
She says she's sorry for
taking the bumblebee pendant.

801
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,700
She just
likes it a lot.

802
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:25,000
- What?
- Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.

803
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:30,200
Cole, that's
very wrong.

804
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:32,800
- Grandma's gone, you know that.
- I know.

805
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:36,300
- She wanted me to tell you--
- Cole, please stop.

806
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:39,100
She wanted me to tell you
she saw you dance.

807
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:44,300
She said
when you were little,

808
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:46,300
you and her
had a fight...

809
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:49,200
right before
your dance recital.

810
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:56,100
- You thought she didn´t come
to see your dance.

811
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,400
She did.

812
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:11,500
She hid in the back
so you wouldn't see.

813
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:14,400
Sh- She said you were
like an angel.

814
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,200
- She said...

815
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:24,700
you came to the place
where they buried her,

816
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:29,400
asked her a question.

817
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:36,300
She said
the answer is...

818
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:38,300
every day.

819
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:43,400
What did you ask?

820
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:54,500
Do--

821
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:58,300
Do I make her proud?

822
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:03,300
Mama.

823
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:35,200
Hi, everybody.
As most of you know,

824
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:37,900
I'm not
used to doing this,

825
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,600
and I promised Anna
that I'd try not to embarrass her.

826
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:45,800
I'll leave that to her mother.

827
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:48,100
But we do want to thank
all of you for coming...

828
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:51,000
and for sharing
this wonderful day with us.

829
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:53,900
It's bitter sweet almost,
for me,

830
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,200
'cause I hate
giving her up.

831
01:36:56,300 --> 01:36:58,400
Anna?

832
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:10,200
I miss you.

833
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:18,700
I miss you too.

834
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:21,500
Why, Malcolm?

835
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:24,400
What?

836
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:29,800
- What is it?
- Why did you leave me?

837
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:33,200
I didn't leave you.

838
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:57,600
I see people.

839
01:37:57,700 --> 01:38:00,100
They don't know
they're dead.

840
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:09,000
- How often
do you see them?
- All the time.

841
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:13,600
They're everywhere.

842
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,500
They only see
what they want to see.

843
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:36,400
Okay, Mikey.

844
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:39,700
Come on.
Give me a minute.

845
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:20,100
- Oh, God.

846
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:23,800
- It doesn't even hurt.
- Let me see.

847
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:29,700
- Let me see. Put your hand--

848
01:39:29,700 --> 01:39:32,000
Oh, God.

849
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:39,400
- Okay.

850
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:02,200
I think I'm okay.
Really, I think it just went--

851
01:40:02,300 --> 01:40:04,600
went in and out.

852
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:10,800
It doesn't even
hurt anymore.

853
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:42,700
I think
I can go now.

854
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:48,900
I just needed
to do a couple things.

855
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,600
I needed
to help someone.

856
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:01,400
I think I did.

857
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:10,200
And I needed
to tell you something.

858
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:18,200
You were never second.

859
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:20,800
Ever.

860
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,700
I love you.

861
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:33,500
You sleep now.

862
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:38,000
Everything will be
different in the morning.

863
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:47,100
Good night,
Malcolm.

864
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:54,300
Good night,
sweetheart.
