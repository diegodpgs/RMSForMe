1
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:06,276
Hello?

2
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,363
Hello?

3
00:01:25,837 --> 00:01:29,215
Hey! Hey! Help me!

4
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,544
Go get him.

5
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:11,633
Day one, Greenie.

6
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:13,259
Rise and shine.

7
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:16,429
He looks like a slopper to me.

8
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:20,433
I could use some help in the kitchen.

9
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:26,147
Hey, we got a runner!

10
00:02:42,247 --> 00:02:43,790
Take it all in.

11
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:22,996
He's all yours.

12
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:36,134
Hey.

13
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:42,473
Hey there, Green Bean.

14
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,976
You're not gonna run again. Okay?

15
00:03:47,312 --> 00:03:48,646
Good.

16
00:03:56,112 --> 00:03:57,655
My name is Alby.

17
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:01,326
Can you tell me anything
about yourself? Who you are?

18
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:04,662
Where you came from? Anything at all.

19
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:10,585
No.

20
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,629
Can you tell me your name?

21
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:19,135
I can't remember anything.

22
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:23,515
- Why can't I remember anything?
- It's okay.

23
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:25,808
Hey, relax.

24
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:27,185
Relax.

25
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:29,687
It's normal.

26
00:04:30,647 --> 00:04:32,482
It happens to us all.

27
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:35,693
You'll get your name
back in a day or two.

28
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:39,280
It's the one thing they let us keep.

29
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:44,702
What is this place?

30
00:04:48,373 --> 00:04:49,916
Let me show you.

31
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,802
We eat here.

32
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:02,303
We sleep here.

33
00:05:02,387 --> 00:05:05,598
We grow our own food.
We build our own shelter.

34
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:10,103
Whatever we need, the Box provides.
The rest is up to us.

35
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:11,563
The Box?

36
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:17,151
Yeah. It's sent up once a month with
fresh supplies and a new Greenie.

37
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:18,820
This month that's you.

38
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:20,530
Congratulations.

39
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:25,410
Sent up? By who, though?
Who put us here?

40
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,871
That, we don't know.

41
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,416
Hey, are you all right, Alby?

42
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:33,126
Green Bean, meet Newt.

43
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:34,961
When I'm not around, he's in charge.

44
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:36,754
It's a good thing you're
always around then.

45
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,965
That was some dash you made earlier.

46
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,010
For a second, I thought you had
the chops to be a runner...

47
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:43,970
till you face-planted.

48
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:45,263
That was great.

49
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:47,432
Wait, a "runner"?

50
00:05:47,557 --> 00:05:50,310
Newt, do me a favor. Go find Chuck.

51
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:52,770
- All right.
- Thanks.

52
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:56,691
Look, I'm sorry to rush this.

53
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:59,944
You came up a little late,
and there's a lot to do.

54
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:02,739
We got something special
planned tonight.

55
00:06:02,864 --> 00:06:05,074
Yeah. You'll see.

56
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,621
I hope you're not afraid of heights.

57
00:06:09,746 --> 00:06:11,956
Let's go. Come on.

58
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,339
This is all we got.

59
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:23,343
We've worked hard for it.

60
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:26,346
If you respect this place...

61
00:06:26,638 --> 00:06:28,848
you and I will get along just fine.

62
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:30,683
What's out there?

63
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:42,904
We only have three rules.

64
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,491
First, do your part.

65
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:49,160
No time for any freeloaders.

66
00:06:50,036 --> 00:06:52,830
Second, never harm another Glader.

67
00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:55,542
None of this works
unless we have trust.

68
00:06:56,835 --> 00:06:58,670
Most importantly...

69
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:02,090
never go beyond those walls.

70
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:05,844
Do you understand me, Greenie?

71
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:08,596
Hey, Alby!

72
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:15,854
Hey, Chuck. Where you been, man?

73
00:07:17,522 --> 00:07:20,441
It's basically the same
story for all of us.

74
00:07:21,192 --> 00:07:24,696
We wake up in the Box,
Alby gives us the tour...

75
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:27,198
then here we are.

76
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:30,869
Don't worry.

77
00:07:30,994 --> 00:07:33,580
You're already doing
better than I did.

78
00:07:33,746 --> 00:07:37,542
I clunked my pants three times
before they got me out of the pit.

79
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:42,672
No, come on.

80
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:51,055
Dude, where are you going?

81
00:07:51,181 --> 00:07:52,765
I just wanna see.

82
00:07:52,891 --> 00:07:55,727
You can look around all you want
but you better not go out there.

83
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:57,395
Why not? What's through there?

84
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:00,273
I don't know. I just
know what I'm told.

85
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:02,609
And we're not supposed to leave.

86
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:14,245
Hey, Chuck. New Greenie?

87
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:16,289
How does it feel to be promoted?

88
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:17,957
Feels great, Ben.

89
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:21,294
I thought no one
was allowed to leave.

90
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,254
I said we're not allowed to leave.

91
00:08:23,338 --> 00:08:26,758
They're different, they're runners.
They know more about the maze than anyone.

92
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:28,218
Wait, what?

93
00:08:28,301 --> 00:08:29,594
What?

94
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:31,804
What? You just said "maze."

95
00:08:32,222 --> 00:08:33,598
I did?

96
00:08:33,723 --> 00:08:34,933
Yeah.

97
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:40,104
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

98
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,439
I'm just gonna take a look.

99
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:45,944
I told you, you can't. No one
leaves, especially not now.

100
00:08:46,903 --> 00:08:48,363
It's not safe.

101
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:50,949
Okay, all right, I'm not gonna go.

102
00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:00,750
Hey!

103
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:05,171
We gotta stop meeting
like this, Greenie.

104
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:07,757
- Get off me!
- All right! Calm, calm, calm.

105
00:09:07,841 --> 00:09:10,677
- Don't touch me!
- Take it easy!

106
00:09:10,802 --> 00:09:11,803
Just relax.

107
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:13,596
What the hell is wrong with you guys?

108
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,806
Just calm down, all right?

109
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:16,933
No, okay? Why won't you
tell me what's out there?

110
00:09:17,016 --> 00:09:18,518
- We're just trying to protect you.
- It's for your own good.

111
00:09:18,643 --> 00:09:19,686
You guys can't just keep me here.

112
00:09:19,811 --> 00:09:22,021
- I can't let you leave.
- Why not?

113
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:41,958
What the hell?

114
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:10,570
Next time, I'm gonna let you leave.

115
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,869
Welcome to the Glade.

116
00:10:28,338 --> 00:10:29,756
Light him up!

117
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:03,039
Hell of a first day, Greenie.

118
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:06,918
Here.

119
00:11:07,544 --> 00:11:09,587
Put some hair on your chest.

120
00:11:18,596 --> 00:11:21,015
Oh, my God! What is that?

121
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:25,895
I don't even know.

122
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:28,648
It's Gally's recipe.

123
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,109
It's a trade secret.

124
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:34,863
Yeah, he's still an asshole.

125
00:11:35,572 --> 00:11:37,490
He saved your life today.

126
00:11:39,951 --> 00:11:43,037
Trust me. The maze is
a dangerous place.

127
00:11:49,294 --> 00:11:51,963
We're trapped here, aren't we?

128
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:54,841
For the moment.

129
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,803
But...

130
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:01,306
you see those guys?

131
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:03,183
There, by the fire?

132
00:12:03,975 --> 00:12:05,768
Those are the runners.

133
00:12:05,852 --> 00:12:08,897
That guy in the middle there,
that's Minho.

134
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:11,274
He's the Keeper of the Runners.

135
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:15,195
Every morning, when those doors
open, they run the maze...

136
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,823
mapping it, memorizing it,
trying to find a way out.

137
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:22,160
How long have they been looking?

138
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:24,412
Three years.

139
00:12:27,123 --> 00:12:29,125
And they haven't found anything?

140
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:31,503
It's a lot easier said than done.

141
00:12:33,004 --> 00:12:34,339
Listen.

142
00:12:38,343 --> 00:12:39,636
Hear that?

143
00:12:40,178 --> 00:12:42,931
It's the maze, changing.

144
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:46,100
It changes every night.

145
00:12:46,851 --> 00:12:49,062
How is that even possible?

146
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:54,192
You can ask the people who put us
in here, if you ever meet the bastards.

147
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:58,905
Listen, the truth is...

148
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:02,075
the runners are the only ones
who really know what's out there.

149
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,452
They are the strongest
and the fastest of us all.

150
00:13:04,536 --> 00:13:05,537
And it's a good thing, too...

151
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,664
because if they don't make it
back before those doors close...

152
00:13:07,747 --> 00:13:10,500
then they are stuck out
there for the night.

153
00:13:11,626 --> 00:13:14,629
And no one has ever survived
a night in the maze.

154
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:21,678
What happens to them?

155
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:27,600
We call them Grievers.

156
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:33,523
Of course, no one's ever seen
one and lived to tell about it.

157
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:37,068
But they're out there.

158
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,910
Right, that's enough questions
for one night. Come on.

159
00:13:45,994 --> 00:13:48,746
You're supposed to be
the guest of honor.

160
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:52,083
No! No, come on.
Let me show you around.

161
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,002
Come on.

162
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:00,008
And there we got the builders.

163
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:03,845
They're very good with their hands
but not a lot going on upstairs.

164
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:05,930
And then we got Winston...

165
00:14:06,014 --> 00:14:08,183
he's the Keeper of the Slicers.

166
00:14:08,683 --> 00:14:10,560
And we got two med-jacks,
Clint and Jeff.

167
00:14:10,643 --> 00:14:12,604
- Hey, what's up?
- Yo, Newt.

168
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,440
They spend most of their time
bandaging up the slicers.

169
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:17,817
What if I want to be a runner?

170
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:21,738
Have you listened to a word I've just said?
No one wants to be a runner.

171
00:14:21,821 --> 00:14:23,865
And, besides, you gotta get chosen.

172
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:25,450
Chosen by who?

173
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:32,707
What do you say, Greenie?

174
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,542
Wanna see what you're made of?

175
00:14:34,626 --> 00:14:37,712
Greenie! Greenie! Greenie!

176
00:14:55,647 --> 00:14:57,440
Okay. All right.

177
00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:00,068
The rules are simple, Greenie.

178
00:15:00,151 --> 00:15:02,487
I try to push you
out of the circle...

179
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,739
you try to last more
than five seconds.

180
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:05,949
Take it easy on the Greenie.

181
00:15:06,032 --> 00:15:07,242
Ready?

182
00:15:13,373 --> 00:15:14,624
Get up, boy.

183
00:15:14,707 --> 00:15:17,210
Come on, Greenie. We're not done yet.

184
00:15:19,546 --> 00:15:21,172
Stop calling me Greenie.

185
00:15:21,256 --> 00:15:22,465
Stop calling you that?

186
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:25,093
What do you wanna be called? Shank?

187
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:30,849
What do you think, boys?
Does he look like a Shank?

188
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:39,232
Come on!

189
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:42,527
You know what?
I think I've settled on Shank.

190
00:15:52,912 --> 00:15:54,706
There you go, Greenie!

191
00:15:57,542 --> 00:15:59,586
Not bad for a Greenie, huh?

192
00:16:08,094 --> 00:16:09,304
Thomas.

193
00:16:10,597 --> 00:16:12,348
Thomas. Hey!

194
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:14,684
Thomas!

195
00:16:16,936 --> 00:16:19,606
I remember my name. I'm Thomas!

196
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:22,650
Thomas!

197
00:16:27,155 --> 00:16:28,907
Welcome home, Thomas.

198
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:42,212
Good job... Thomas.

199
00:16:50,762 --> 00:16:52,597
What the hell was that?

200
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:57,060
That, my friend, was a Griever.

201
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,356
Don't worry,
you're safe here with us.

202
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,484
Nothing gets through those walls.

203
00:17:04,943 --> 00:17:05,985
All right, guys.

204
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,196
Let's tuck it in for
the night. Come on.

205
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,989
It was a good night.

206
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,492
Good job, man.

207
00:17:42,814 --> 00:17:43,857
You're safe here with us.

208
00:17:43,982 --> 00:17:45,191
Wicked is good.

209
00:17:45,316 --> 00:17:46,317
What's out there?

210
00:17:46,401 --> 00:17:48,278
Thomas, Thomas.

211
00:17:51,322 --> 00:17:52,907
Can you hear me?

212
00:17:53,658 --> 00:17:55,827
Everything is going to change.

213
00:17:57,829 --> 00:17:58,997
Thomas.

214
00:18:04,711 --> 00:18:06,171
Follow me.

215
00:18:13,011 --> 00:18:14,888
It's peaceful, isn't it?

216
00:18:16,014 --> 00:18:19,517
I know it's hard to believe,
but it wasn't always this way.

217
00:18:20,185 --> 00:18:22,103
We had dark days.

218
00:18:23,438 --> 00:18:25,940
We lost a lot of boys to fear.

219
00:18:26,191 --> 00:18:27,734
To panic.

220
00:18:29,027 --> 00:18:31,070
We've come far since then.

221
00:18:32,447 --> 00:18:34,157
Established order...

222
00:18:34,949 --> 00:18:36,451
made peace.

223
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:40,663
Yeah. Why are you telling me this?

224
00:18:40,872 --> 00:18:43,249
Because you're not like the others.

225
00:18:44,626 --> 00:18:46,377
You're curious.

226
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:48,838
But you're one of us now.

227
00:18:49,797 --> 00:18:52,091
You need to know what that means.

228
00:19:14,322 --> 00:19:16,199
What happened to them?

229
00:19:16,908 --> 00:19:18,493
Like I said...

230
00:19:19,953 --> 00:19:21,746
dark days, Thomas.

231
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,221
Has anyone tried climbing to the top?

232
00:19:38,972 --> 00:19:42,350
Tried it. The ivy doesn't
go all the way to the top.

233
00:19:42,517 --> 00:19:45,270
Besides, where are you
gonna go from there?

234
00:19:45,645 --> 00:19:48,064
And what about the Box?
Next time it comes up...

235
00:19:48,147 --> 00:19:49,774
No, we tried that.

236
00:19:49,858 --> 00:19:51,901
The Box won't go back
down with someone in it.

237
00:19:51,985 --> 00:19:54,445
- Okay, what if we...
- No, we tried it, all right?

238
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:55,947
Twice.

239
00:19:56,781 --> 00:20:00,869
All right? Trust me. Anything you
think of, we've already tried.

240
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,956
The only way out of here
is through the maze.

241
00:20:05,498 --> 00:20:07,750
Now, look, you wanna be helpful?

242
00:20:08,877 --> 00:20:12,088
Here. Go dig us up
some more fertilizer.

243
00:20:20,555 --> 00:20:23,141
"Just get the fertilizer, Thomas."

244
00:20:23,224 --> 00:20:26,269
"Are you sure, guys?
I can't help in any other way?"

245
00:20:26,352 --> 00:20:28,688
"No, just get the fertilizer.

246
00:20:29,814 --> 00:20:33,568
"You know where it is. It's just
out in the middle of the woods."

247
00:21:18,446 --> 00:21:19,489
You're Ben, right?

248
00:21:19,572 --> 00:21:21,574
I don't know if we ever...

249
00:21:23,368 --> 00:21:24,786
Are you okay?

250
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:29,707
Get the hell off me!

251
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,543
It's your fault.

252
00:21:31,626 --> 00:21:33,086
I saw you.

253
00:21:33,211 --> 00:21:34,587
You did this.

254
00:21:34,712 --> 00:21:36,256
I saw you!

255
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,156
Hey! Hey!

256
00:22:06,744 --> 00:22:08,496
Hey!

257
00:22:09,247 --> 00:22:11,124
Help!

258
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,710
Help! Help!

259
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,421
Help!

260
00:22:22,093 --> 00:22:23,595
I'll kill you!

261
00:22:27,932 --> 00:22:29,350
Hold him down.

262
00:22:29,434 --> 00:22:31,144
What are you doing?

263
00:22:31,269 --> 00:22:32,478
Calm down, Ben.

264
00:22:32,604 --> 00:22:33,813
What the hell happened?

265
00:22:33,938 --> 00:22:36,274
- He just attacked me!
- Are you okay?

266
00:22:37,275 --> 00:22:38,776
Calm down, Ben.

267
00:22:41,613 --> 00:22:43,406
No. No.

268
00:22:43,948 --> 00:22:45,450
Lift his shirt.

269
00:22:45,575 --> 00:22:46,618
Lift his shirt.

270
00:22:46,701 --> 00:22:47,702
No! No!

271
00:22:47,785 --> 00:22:48,578
No! no!

272
00:22:48,661 --> 00:22:50,205
Please. Please.

273
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:54,667
He's been stung.

274
00:22:55,627 --> 00:22:57,545
In the middle of the day?

275
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,048
Help me, please.

276
00:23:00,131 --> 00:23:03,176
Please. Please, just help.

277
00:23:04,594 --> 00:23:05,595
Put him in the pit.

278
00:23:05,678 --> 00:23:08,139
- Everybody, help. Take him to the pit.
- No!

279
00:23:08,264 --> 00:23:10,642
- Med-jack!
- Please don't do it!

280
00:23:11,142 --> 00:23:12,227
Calm down, Ben.

281
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,770
Back down, Ben.

282
00:23:13,853 --> 00:23:15,939
Listen to me! Please!

283
00:23:19,025 --> 00:23:20,985
Please, stop, please!

284
00:23:21,194 --> 00:23:22,612
He did this!

285
00:23:22,695 --> 00:23:25,532
Please stop! No! No, please! Help me!

286
00:23:25,657 --> 00:23:27,534
So what happened to him?

287
00:23:30,745 --> 00:23:33,081
It's called "The Changing."

288
00:23:34,082 --> 00:23:37,210
It's what happens when
someone gets stung.

289
00:23:38,878 --> 00:23:40,171
Listen.

290
00:23:45,718 --> 00:23:49,722
We haven't been able to get a clear
word out of Ben since it happened.

291
00:23:50,181 --> 00:23:52,308
He's not making any sense.

292
00:23:52,851 --> 00:23:55,436
And it's only gonna get worse.

293
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,691
The infection is spreading.
He's dangerous.

294
00:24:02,026 --> 00:24:04,279
What did he say to you?

295
00:24:10,368 --> 00:24:13,288
He said he saw me...

296
00:24:13,371 --> 00:24:15,665
and that this was all my fault.

297
00:24:17,876 --> 00:24:20,211
How could this be my fault?

298
00:24:26,301 --> 00:24:27,927
Get some rest.

299
00:24:29,137 --> 00:24:30,805
- Alby?
- Yeah.

300
00:24:32,015 --> 00:24:34,017
What's gonna happen to him?

301
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,076
Just listen to me.
Just, please, listen to me!

302
00:24:52,202 --> 00:24:53,912
Please, Minho!

303
00:24:55,955 --> 00:24:57,248
Alby!

304
00:25:22,732 --> 00:25:26,152
No, please. Please, don't.

305
00:25:26,277 --> 00:25:27,946
Please, don't do it.

306
00:25:43,294 --> 00:25:44,546
Poles!

307
00:25:54,639 --> 00:25:56,140
Move in!

308
00:25:56,933 --> 00:25:59,185
No, no, no! Please!

309
00:25:59,853 --> 00:26:02,647
No, please! Please, don't!

310
00:26:02,772 --> 00:26:05,859
I can get better!
Please, just listen to me!

311
00:26:06,109 --> 00:26:07,819
Please, stop, please!

312
00:26:09,362 --> 00:26:11,072
- Push him in!
- Stop!

313
00:26:12,448 --> 00:26:14,075
I'll get better!

314
00:26:49,569 --> 00:26:51,613
He belongs to the maze now.

315
00:27:30,235 --> 00:27:32,362
Do you think he might make it?

316
00:27:34,572 --> 00:27:36,199
Ben?

317
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:39,536
No.

318
00:27:40,745 --> 00:27:43,581
No one survives a night in the maze.

319
00:27:47,252 --> 00:27:49,629
We just gotta forget about him.

320
00:28:19,284 --> 00:28:20,910
Thomas.

321
00:28:21,703 --> 00:28:23,955
Wicked is good.

322
00:28:24,247 --> 00:28:26,249
Don't make it easy on them.

323
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:29,002
Thomas.

324
00:28:29,127 --> 00:28:31,963
Everything is going to change.

325
00:28:33,464 --> 00:28:35,341
Wicked is good.

326
00:28:37,927 --> 00:28:39,971
This is gonna hurt a little.

327
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,057
Wicked is good.

328
00:28:43,141 --> 00:28:46,019
Thomas, you have to choose.

329
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:16,549
But why would Alby go into the maze?

330
00:29:16,674 --> 00:29:18,927
I mean, he's not a runner.

331
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,595
Things are different now.

332
00:29:20,678 --> 00:29:23,014
Alby went to retrace Ben's
footsteps before sundown.

333
00:29:23,139 --> 00:29:24,224
Are you gonna help?

334
00:29:24,349 --> 00:29:26,351
So he's gonna go back to
where Ben was just stung...

335
00:29:26,434 --> 00:29:27,894
Alby knows what he's doing...

336
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:29,229
all right?

337
00:29:29,354 --> 00:29:31,523
He knows better than any of us.

338
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:34,526
What does that mean?

339
00:29:38,071 --> 00:29:40,365
It's like you have heard, yeah?

340
00:29:40,448 --> 00:29:43,493
Every month, the Box
sends up a new arrival.

341
00:29:43,576 --> 00:29:45,954
But someone had to be first, right?

342
00:29:46,579 --> 00:29:50,625
Someone had to have spent a
whole month in the Glade, alone.

343
00:29:52,043 --> 00:29:54,128
That was Alby.

344
00:29:55,505 --> 00:29:57,674
I mean, it can't have been easy.

345
00:29:57,757 --> 00:30:00,677
But when those other boys started
coming up, one after the other...

346
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,846
he saw the truth.

347
00:30:02,929 --> 00:30:05,223
And he learned that the
most important thing...

348
00:30:05,306 --> 00:30:07,517
is that we all have each other.

349
00:30:09,143 --> 00:30:11,479
Because we're all in this together.

350
00:30:29,831 --> 00:30:31,082
Yeah.

351
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:33,835
There you go, Greenie.

352
00:30:57,525 --> 00:30:59,861
They should be back by now.

353
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:02,739
What happens if they don't make it?

354
00:31:02,947 --> 00:31:04,782
They're gonna make it.

355
00:31:07,035 --> 00:31:09,037
What happens if they don't?

356
00:31:09,746 --> 00:31:11,623
They're gonna make it.

357
00:31:44,739 --> 00:31:46,616
Come on, guys, can't we
send someone after them?

358
00:31:46,699 --> 00:31:48,660
That's against the rules.

359
00:31:48,826 --> 00:31:51,371
Either they make it
back or they don't.

360
00:31:51,746 --> 00:31:54,332
We can't risk losing anyone else.

361
00:32:05,051 --> 00:32:06,719
Oh, no.

362
00:32:09,764 --> 00:32:11,015
There!

363
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:15,687
Wait, something's wrong.

364
00:32:17,355 --> 00:32:19,065
Come on, Minho, you can do it!

365
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,442
Come on! Go!

366
00:32:23,486 --> 00:32:25,238
Come on, you can make it!

367
00:32:25,363 --> 00:32:26,865
Minho, you gotta leave him!

368
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,908
They're not gonna make it.

369
00:32:29,284 --> 00:32:30,994
You gotta leave him!

370
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:50,388
Thomas, no!

371
00:33:05,361 --> 00:33:06,696
Good job.

372
00:33:08,156 --> 00:33:10,366
You just killed yourself.

373
00:33:11,993 --> 00:33:13,328
What?

374
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:28,426
What happened to him?

375
00:33:28,801 --> 00:33:30,637
What does it look like?

376
00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:33,097
He got stung.

377
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,100
What happened to his head?

378
00:33:37,352 --> 00:33:39,771
I did what I had to do.

379
00:33:51,908 --> 00:33:54,744
Okay. Okay, help me get him up.

380
00:33:54,827 --> 00:33:57,163
We gotta go. The maze
is already changing.

381
00:33:57,288 --> 00:33:58,915
Hey, Minho!

382
00:34:01,584 --> 00:34:03,920
We can't just leave him here.

383
00:34:16,057 --> 00:34:18,142
We gotta get him up.

384
00:34:24,983 --> 00:34:26,609
Come on.

385
00:34:36,995 --> 00:34:39,330
Just sit him down. Sit him down.

386
00:34:52,177 --> 00:34:54,596
This isn't going to work.
We gotta go.

387
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:55,805
We gotta go!

388
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:58,266
Wait, what are you talking about?
We gotta hide him.

389
00:34:58,349 --> 00:34:59,559
- Where?
- I don't know.

390
00:34:59,684 --> 00:35:03,396
Are you telling me there's not a
single place we could take him?

391
00:35:04,939 --> 00:35:06,733
Listen to me, shuck-face, all right.

392
00:35:06,858 --> 00:35:10,486
Take a look around.
There's nowhere to go!

393
00:35:15,742 --> 00:35:17,452
You don't get it.

394
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,787
We're already dead.

395
00:35:41,017 --> 00:35:42,894
Two, three...

396
00:35:47,857 --> 00:35:49,567
Two, three...

397
00:35:53,238 --> 00:35:54,572
Okay.

398
00:35:56,741 --> 00:35:59,285
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

399
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:02,914
What are you doing?

400
00:36:06,751 --> 00:36:08,586
We gotta go. We gotta go now!

401
00:36:08,711 --> 00:36:11,798
No, no, just a little more
and we'll tie it off.

402
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,886
Minho, stay with me.

403
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,346
Stay with me, Minho.

404
00:36:18,429 --> 00:36:20,014
Just a little more,
we're almost there.

405
00:36:20,098 --> 00:36:21,683
- I'm sorry, Greenie.
- What?

406
00:36:21,766 --> 00:36:23,059
Minho!

407
00:37:02,974 --> 00:37:04,517
Okay.

408
00:37:21,618 --> 00:37:23,328
Come on.

409
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:53,960
Oh, shit!

410
00:40:02,654 --> 00:40:04,739
You're a crazy son of a bitch.

411
00:40:06,032 --> 00:40:08,117
Come on, follow me. Come on!

412
00:40:13,998 --> 00:40:17,585
Okay, it's changing.
Come on, come on!

413
00:40:18,336 --> 00:40:19,712
This section is closing. Come on.

414
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:21,756
We can lose it down here!

415
00:40:28,304 --> 00:40:29,347
Thomas!

416
00:40:29,472 --> 00:40:32,183
What are you waiting for?
Get out of there!

417
00:40:37,939 --> 00:40:39,190
Come on!

418
00:40:43,486 --> 00:40:44,696
Come on!

419
00:40:44,779 --> 00:40:46,698
Come on, Thomas! Don't look back!

420
00:40:46,823 --> 00:40:48,199
Run!

421
00:40:48,449 --> 00:40:50,285
Move it, Thomas! Go on!

422
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,996
Move your ass! Let's go! Come on!

423
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:55,206
Come on, Greenie! Let's go!

424
00:40:55,623 --> 00:40:57,166
Thomas!

425
00:41:04,799 --> 00:41:07,302
Guys, get up!

426
00:41:22,525 --> 00:41:24,360
I told you, Chuck.

427
00:41:24,444 --> 00:41:26,696
They're not coming back.

428
00:41:27,363 --> 00:41:29,032
Let's go.

429
00:41:38,082 --> 00:41:39,751
No way.

430
00:41:41,002 --> 00:41:42,212
Yeah!

431
00:41:42,837 --> 00:41:44,047
Yes!

432
00:41:44,464 --> 00:41:45,757
Yeah!

433
00:41:50,261 --> 00:41:51,596
I got him, I got him, I got him.

434
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:53,765
Watch out. Easy.

435
00:41:54,474 --> 00:41:57,810
- What happened out there?
- How did you guys make it out?

436
00:42:01,064 --> 00:42:02,649
You saw a Griever?

437
00:42:03,775 --> 00:42:05,818
Yeah, I saw one.

438
00:42:06,528 --> 00:42:08,321
He didn't just see it.

439
00:42:08,446 --> 00:42:10,615
He killed it.

440
00:42:21,459 --> 00:42:23,211
Things are changing.

441
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:26,798
There's no denying that.

442
00:42:28,341 --> 00:42:31,553
First, Ben gets stung
in broad daylight.

443
00:42:32,011 --> 00:42:33,805
And then Alby.

444
00:42:34,722 --> 00:42:38,268
And now our Greenie, here,
has taken it upon himself...

445
00:42:38,351 --> 00:42:40,144
to go into the maze.

446
00:42:41,187 --> 00:42:44,357
Which is a clear violation
of our rules here.

447
00:42:44,482 --> 00:42:45,441
Yeah...

448
00:42:45,525 --> 00:42:47,652
but he saved Alby's life.

449
00:42:48,444 --> 00:42:49,946
Did he?

450
00:42:52,365 --> 00:42:55,827
For 3 years, we have
coexisted with these things.

451
00:42:55,952 --> 00:42:58,329
And now, you've killed one of them.

452
00:43:00,665 --> 00:43:03,251
Who knows what that
could mean for us.

453
00:43:03,877 --> 00:43:06,254
What do you suggest we do?

454
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:08,631
He has to be punished.

455
00:43:09,632 --> 00:43:11,759
- Come on.
- He killed a Griever!

456
00:43:12,135 --> 00:43:13,344
Minho.

457
00:43:13,636 --> 00:43:16,306
You were there with him.
What do you think?

458
00:43:19,726 --> 00:43:21,561
I think...

459
00:43:21,686 --> 00:43:24,647
in all the time we've been here...

460
00:43:24,731 --> 00:43:27,817
no one has ever killed
a Griever before.

461
00:43:31,404 --> 00:43:33,865
When I turned tail and ran...

462
00:43:33,948 --> 00:43:37,452
this dumb shank stayed
behind to help Alby.

463
00:43:38,786 --> 00:43:41,956
Look, I don't know if
he's brave or stupid.

464
00:43:45,168 --> 00:43:47,670
But whatever it is,
we need more of it.

465
00:43:49,088 --> 00:43:50,423
I say we make him a runner.

466
00:43:50,548 --> 00:43:52,800
A runner? What?

467
00:43:53,176 --> 00:43:55,053
Minho, let's not jump the gun, here.

468
00:43:55,136 --> 00:43:58,223
Thomas! Thomas! Thomas!

469
00:43:59,015 --> 00:44:02,227
If you want to throw the
newbie a parade, that's fine.

470
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:04,062
Go ahead.

471
00:44:04,145 --> 00:44:06,898
But if there is one thing
I know about the maze...

472
00:44:06,981 --> 00:44:08,816
it is that you do not...

473
00:44:23,414 --> 00:44:24,874
Okay, wait. I know that sound.

474
00:44:24,958 --> 00:44:27,919
- The Box. It's coming back up.
- It shouldn't be.

475
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:41,599
- Newt, what do you see?
- Do you see it?

476
00:44:42,392 --> 00:44:43,768
It's a girl.

477
00:44:46,062 --> 00:44:47,272
No way.

478
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,986
I think she's dead.

479
00:44:53,611 --> 00:44:55,280
What's in her hand?

480
00:45:06,499 --> 00:45:11,254
"She's the last one... ever."

481
00:45:14,716 --> 00:45:16,843
What the hell does that mean?

482
00:45:19,512 --> 00:45:21,264
Thomas...

483
00:45:36,779 --> 00:45:39,407
Do you still think I'm overreacting?

484
00:45:53,087 --> 00:45:55,632
Jeff, what's going on?

485
00:45:55,715 --> 00:45:57,842
What's the matter with her?
Why won't she wake up?

486
00:45:57,926 --> 00:46:01,137
Hey man, I got my job
the same way you did.

487
00:46:07,185 --> 00:46:08,937
Do you recognize her?

488
00:46:09,687 --> 00:46:10,939
No.

489
00:46:11,147 --> 00:46:14,192
Really? Because she
seemed to recognize you.

490
00:46:15,485 --> 00:46:17,195
What about the note?

491
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:20,031
We'll worry about the note later.

492
00:46:20,156 --> 00:46:22,742
I think you should
worry about it now.

493
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,371
We've got enough to deal
with at the moment.

494
00:46:26,454 --> 00:46:28,373
He's right, Newt.

495
00:46:29,123 --> 00:46:33,002
If the Box isn't coming back up,
how long do you think we can last?

496
00:46:33,169 --> 00:46:35,213
No one said that.

497
00:46:35,588 --> 00:46:38,007
Let's not jump to any conclusions.

498
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,720
We'll just wait until she wakes
up and see what she knows.

499
00:46:43,346 --> 00:46:46,349
Somebody has gotta have
some answers around here.

500
00:46:47,642 --> 00:46:48,852
Okay.

501
00:46:50,103 --> 00:46:53,022
- Where are you going?
- Back into the maze.

502
00:46:57,694 --> 00:46:58,903
Hey.

503
00:46:59,654 --> 00:47:01,239
Hey, Thomas.

504
00:47:02,198 --> 00:47:05,368
What is this with you? A death wish?

505
00:47:05,451 --> 00:47:08,121
You just got out and
now you want back in?

506
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:12,876
Newt said that no one has ever seen a
Griever and lived to tell about it, right?

507
00:47:12,959 --> 00:47:15,461
Minho, now we have one.

508
00:47:15,587 --> 00:47:18,590
You're telling me you're not
even a little bit curious?

509
00:47:18,715 --> 00:47:20,550
Not really, no.

510
00:47:25,096 --> 00:47:28,725
So, what's the plan? You're gonna go out
and dissect that thing all by yourself?

511
00:47:28,808 --> 00:47:30,768
I will if I have to.

512
00:47:31,352 --> 00:47:33,271
Have the other runners left yet?

513
00:47:33,396 --> 00:47:35,773
The other runners quit this morning.

514
00:47:37,942 --> 00:47:41,905
After Alby got stung, they're not
in any hurry to get back out there.

515
00:47:43,072 --> 00:47:45,158
Why are you?

516
00:47:46,576 --> 00:47:50,038
I think it's time we find out
what we're really up against.

517
00:47:53,374 --> 00:47:54,792
All right.

518
00:47:54,876 --> 00:47:57,128
But you're not going
back out there alone.

519
00:47:57,253 --> 00:47:59,714
Meet me in the woods in half-an-hour.

520
00:48:22,195 --> 00:48:24,280
Will this be enough?

521
00:48:27,659 --> 00:48:29,160
Okay.

522
00:48:30,161 --> 00:48:31,829
Let's go.

523
00:48:48,221 --> 00:48:49,639
Come on!

524
00:49:11,703 --> 00:49:13,705
That's disgusting.

525
00:49:14,622 --> 00:49:16,624
There's something in there.

526
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:19,544
You mean, besides a Griever pancake?

527
00:49:27,677 --> 00:49:30,096
Whoa, what are you doing?

528
00:49:44,944 --> 00:49:47,155
I thought you said it was dead.

529
00:49:47,322 --> 00:49:49,991
- Was it a reflex?
- You hope.

530
00:49:51,951 --> 00:49:54,579
Okay, come on.
Let's try and pull it out.

531
00:49:54,829 --> 00:49:56,539
Everyone get a hand on it. Come on.

532
00:49:56,623 --> 00:49:58,416
All right, ready? On three.

533
00:49:58,499 --> 00:50:00,543
One, two, three!

534
00:50:09,844 --> 00:50:12,555
- Are you okay, Fry?
- Yeah. Thanks, brother.

535
00:50:46,631 --> 00:50:48,424
What the hell is that?

536
00:50:57,475 --> 00:50:58,560
Interesting.

537
00:50:58,643 --> 00:51:00,103
Okay, whatever it is...

538
00:51:00,186 --> 00:51:02,105
can we take this up
back at the Glade?

539
00:51:02,188 --> 00:51:04,983
Because I don't want to
meet this guy's friends.

540
00:51:05,066 --> 00:51:06,526
He's right.

541
00:51:06,651 --> 00:51:09,487
It's getting late. Come on.

542
00:51:20,832 --> 00:51:22,292
We found this.

543
00:51:22,584 --> 00:51:24,878
It was inside a Griever.

544
00:51:25,003 --> 00:51:26,888
These are the same letters
we get in our supplies.

545
00:51:26,971 --> 00:51:31,176
Yeah. Whoever put us here
obviously made the Grievers.

546
00:51:31,259 --> 00:51:34,512
This is the first real clue, the first
anything, you've found in over 3 years.

547
00:51:34,596 --> 00:51:37,307
- Right, Minho?
- Right.

548
00:51:37,515 --> 00:51:40,268
Newt, we gotta go back out there.

549
00:51:40,351 --> 00:51:43,271
Who knows where this might lead us.

550
00:51:45,523 --> 00:51:48,026
You see what he's
trying to do, right?

551
00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:49,694
First he breaks our rules...

552
00:51:49,777 --> 00:51:52,822
and then he tries to convince
us to abandon them totally.

553
00:51:52,906 --> 00:51:55,366
The rules are the only thing
that have ever held us together.

554
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:58,077
Why now are we questioning that?

555
00:51:58,286 --> 00:52:00,663
If Alby was here,
you know he'd agree with me.

556
00:52:00,747 --> 00:52:04,125
This shank needs to be punished.

557
00:52:11,883 --> 00:52:13,051
You're right.

558
00:52:13,134 --> 00:52:15,053
Thomas broke the rules.

559
00:52:15,428 --> 00:52:16,846
One night in the pit, and no food.

560
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:19,724
Come on, Newt! One night in the pit?

561
00:52:19,807 --> 00:52:22,185
Do you think that's gonna stop
him from going into the maze?

562
00:52:22,268 --> 00:52:23,520
No.

563
00:52:23,603 --> 00:52:28,316
And we can't just have non-runners running
into the maze whenever they feel like it.

564
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:30,693
So let's just make this official.

565
00:52:30,777 --> 00:52:33,363
Starting from tomorrow,
you're a runner.

566
00:52:38,493 --> 00:52:39,702
Wow.

567
00:52:39,786 --> 00:52:41,746
- Gally...
- No, Fry.

568
00:52:49,337 --> 00:52:50,797
Thanks, Newt.

569
00:53:08,314 --> 00:53:09,816
Hey, where are we going?

570
00:53:09,941 --> 00:53:12,151
You'll see.

571
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,139
It's the maze.

572
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:43,766
All of it.

573
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:49,355
What do you mean "all of it"?
I thought you were still mapping it.

574
00:53:50,023 --> 00:53:52,066
There's nothing left to map.

575
00:53:54,068 --> 00:53:56,154
I've run every inch of it myself.

576
00:53:56,237 --> 00:53:57,780
Every cycle.

577
00:53:57,864 --> 00:53:59,532
Every pattern.

578
00:54:01,492 --> 00:54:04,746
If there was a way out,
we would have found it by now.

579
00:54:06,372 --> 00:54:08,917
Why haven't you told anyone this?

580
00:54:10,668 --> 00:54:12,962
It was Alby's call.

581
00:54:13,046 --> 00:54:16,382
People needed to believe we
had a chance of getting out.

582
00:54:17,675 --> 00:54:19,219
But maybe now...

583
00:54:20,345 --> 00:54:22,138
we have a real chance.

584
00:54:27,143 --> 00:54:28,853
Take a look at this.

585
00:54:29,604 --> 00:54:32,482
About a year ago, we started
exploring these outer sections.

586
00:54:32,565 --> 00:54:35,610
We found these numbers
printed on the walls.

587
00:54:35,693 --> 00:54:38,404
Sections 1 through 8.

588
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:42,283
See, the way it works, is every night,
when the maze changes...

589
00:54:42,367 --> 00:54:44,327
it opens up a new section.

590
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:46,913
So today, Section 6 was open.

591
00:54:47,038 --> 00:54:50,750
Tomorrow, it will be 4,
then 8, then 3.

592
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:53,419
The pattern always stays the same.

593
00:54:56,548 --> 00:54:58,466
What's so special about 7?

594
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:00,260
I don't know.

595
00:55:01,052 --> 00:55:03,680
But last night, when you
killed that Griever...

596
00:55:03,763 --> 00:55:05,682
Section 7 was open.

597
00:55:05,765 --> 00:55:08,351
I think it must be
where it comes from.

598
00:55:08,434 --> 00:55:11,437
Tomorrow, you and I are
gonna take a closer look.

599
00:55:12,564 --> 00:55:13,606
Hey!

600
00:55:13,731 --> 00:55:15,692
What are you guys doing?
You're not allowed in here.

601
00:55:15,775 --> 00:55:18,570
- Sorry, it's just the...
- It's the girl.

602
00:55:18,736 --> 00:55:20,196
Is she awake?

603
00:55:20,572 --> 00:55:21,739
You could say that.

604
00:55:22,365 --> 00:55:24,367
Chuck, what's going on?

605
00:55:24,742 --> 00:55:26,536
Girls are awesome.

606
00:55:27,078 --> 00:55:28,413
Leave me alone!

607
00:55:28,538 --> 00:55:30,123
Watch your head!

608
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:33,001
Hey, throw one more
of those things...

609
00:55:33,168 --> 00:55:34,752
- Go away!
- We come in peace!

610
00:55:34,878 --> 00:55:35,920
- What happened?
- Just duck!

611
00:55:36,045 --> 00:55:37,505
I don't think she likes us very much.

612
00:55:37,589 --> 00:55:39,424
- What do you want from me?
- We just wanna talk.

613
00:55:39,549 --> 00:55:40,758
I'm warning you!

614
00:55:40,884 --> 00:55:42,969
Take cover, y'all! Take cover!

615
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,097
Hey, it's Thomas! It's Thomas!

616
00:55:52,604 --> 00:55:54,898
I'm gonna come up, okay?

617
00:55:58,443 --> 00:55:59,611
Okay.

618
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:02,238
Just me.

619
00:56:06,242 --> 00:56:07,827
I'm coming up.

620
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:16,628
Okay, just...

621
00:56:16,753 --> 00:56:18,338
Easy, all right?

622
00:56:18,963 --> 00:56:20,465
Where am I?

623
00:56:20,548 --> 00:56:22,467
What is this place?

624
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:23,968
Why can't I remember anything?

625
00:56:24,093 --> 00:56:27,013
This is all normal. Okay?
We've all been through this.

626
00:56:27,138 --> 00:56:28,306
Okay?

627
00:56:29,265 --> 00:56:31,309
Your name will come back
to you in a couple of days.

628
00:56:31,392 --> 00:56:33,770
- It's the one thing that...
- Teresa.

629
00:56:34,771 --> 00:56:35,813
What did you say?

630
00:56:35,939 --> 00:56:37,315
My name.

631
00:56:37,941 --> 00:56:39,984
It's Teresa.

632
00:56:41,444 --> 00:56:43,363
Teresa, I'm Thomas.

633
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:49,327
But you already knew that,
though, I guess, huh?

634
00:56:50,328 --> 00:56:53,331
They said I kept saying
your name in my sleep.

635
00:56:53,456 --> 00:56:54,832
Who are you?

636
00:56:59,295 --> 00:57:00,672
I don't know.

637
00:57:03,132 --> 00:57:05,093
I can't remember.

638
00:57:05,176 --> 00:57:08,388
None of us here can
remember anything.

639
00:57:09,472 --> 00:57:11,933
We all woke up here
just like you did.

640
00:57:12,934 --> 00:57:14,644
Hey, I promise...

641
00:57:17,814 --> 00:57:19,566
I'm gonna take this.

642
00:57:22,277 --> 00:57:23,695
Okay.

643
00:57:24,863 --> 00:57:26,823
What's going on up there?

644
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:32,036
Is she coming down?

645
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:43,423
Listen, you guys just
give us a second, okay?

646
00:57:45,466 --> 00:57:46,759
All right.

647
00:57:47,218 --> 00:57:48,428
Come on.

648
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,014
Is this what all girls are like?

649
00:57:53,224 --> 00:57:55,101
That girl is crazy.

650
00:57:59,397 --> 00:58:02,734
"She's the last one."
What does that mean?

651
00:58:02,901 --> 00:58:04,569
I'm not sure.

652
00:58:05,987 --> 00:58:09,240
Ever since you came up,
that Box hasn't gone back down.

653
00:58:10,575 --> 00:58:13,536
I just think it's got
everyone a little worried.

654
00:58:15,371 --> 00:58:17,248
Especially Gally.

655
00:58:20,585 --> 00:58:22,754
He thinks it's my fault.

656
00:58:27,175 --> 00:58:30,011
Are you sure you don't
remember anything else?

657
00:58:31,554 --> 00:58:33,223
I remember water...

658
00:58:34,098 --> 00:58:36,100
feeling like I was drowning.

659
00:58:37,894 --> 00:58:40,104
These faces staring at me.

660
00:58:42,524 --> 00:58:46,444
And this woman's voice saying
the same thing over and over.

661
00:58:46,569 --> 00:58:48,154
"Wicked is good."

662
00:58:52,033 --> 00:58:54,827
Ever since I've been here,
I've had these dreams.

663
00:58:54,953 --> 00:58:57,247
I thought they were dreams.

664
00:59:00,124 --> 00:59:01,292
You...

665
00:59:02,377 --> 00:59:04,462
You were there.

666
00:59:06,923 --> 00:59:07,924
You were there...

667
00:59:08,007 --> 00:59:11,177
and you told me that
everything was gonna change.

668
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:16,140
What does it mean?

669
00:59:17,934 --> 00:59:21,312
I don't know.
I just always get pieces.

670
00:59:22,146 --> 00:59:24,482
And the others don't
remember anything?

671
00:59:24,607 --> 00:59:25,817
No.

672
00:59:28,653 --> 00:59:30,488
Why are we different?

673
00:59:38,037 --> 00:59:40,623
These were in my
pocket when I came up.

674
00:59:47,172 --> 00:59:49,757
"W.C.K.D."

675
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:54,846
"Wicked is good."

676
00:59:56,431 --> 00:59:59,058
What if we were sent
here for a reason?

677
01:00:03,021 --> 01:00:04,272
Alby.

678
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:07,233
We don't even know
what this stuff is.

679
01:00:07,358 --> 01:00:08,860
We don't know who sent it.

680
01:00:08,985 --> 01:00:10,695
Or why it came up here with you.

681
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:13,823
For all we know,
this thing could kill him.

682
01:00:13,948 --> 01:00:15,658
He's already dying.

683
01:00:16,326 --> 01:00:17,702
Look at him.

684
01:00:18,494 --> 01:00:21,539
How could this possibly
make it any worse?

685
01:00:22,624 --> 01:00:25,043
Come on, it's worth a try.

686
01:00:28,338 --> 01:00:29,881
All right.

687
01:00:30,465 --> 01:00:31,883
Do it.

688
01:00:41,059 --> 01:00:42,352
Okay.

689
01:00:44,312 --> 01:00:46,272
You shouldn't be here!
You shouldn't be here!

690
01:00:46,397 --> 01:00:47,607
No!

691
01:00:47,982 --> 01:00:49,526
Watch out!

692
01:00:51,861 --> 01:00:53,905
Get the syringe! Let go!

693
01:01:03,331 --> 01:01:05,416
Well, that worked.

694
01:01:05,667 --> 01:01:07,043
Okay, from now on...

695
01:01:07,126 --> 01:01:10,421
someone stays here and
watches him around the clock.

696
01:01:14,717 --> 01:01:16,261
Hey.

697
01:01:18,972 --> 01:01:22,016
Sundown, Greenie. Time to go.

698
01:01:37,699 --> 01:01:40,076
Hey, what is your problem with me?

699
01:01:40,535 --> 01:01:43,872
Everything started going wrong
the minute you showed up.

700
01:01:44,122 --> 01:01:46,457
First Ben, then Alby...

701
01:01:47,041 --> 01:01:48,585
and now the girl.

702
01:01:50,086 --> 01:01:52,380
Everybody saw she recognized you.

703
01:01:54,007 --> 01:01:56,801
And I'm betting you know who she is.

704
01:02:11,941 --> 01:02:13,276
Gally...

705
01:02:15,653 --> 01:02:18,948
you know we can't stay
here forever, right?

706
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:40,637
Who's there?

707
01:02:41,513 --> 01:02:42,972
It's just me.

708
01:02:43,389 --> 01:02:44,682
Sorry, Chuck.

709
01:02:44,807 --> 01:02:46,142
Here.

710
01:02:46,267 --> 01:02:48,645
You'll run better on a full stomach.

711
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:02,700
Thanks, Chuck.

712
01:03:07,622 --> 01:03:09,624
Hey, what do you got there?

713
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:18,216
Wow, that came out pretty damn good.

714
01:03:18,341 --> 01:03:19,884
What's that for?

715
01:03:21,052 --> 01:03:23,179
It's for my parents.

716
01:03:23,638 --> 01:03:25,932
You remember your parents?

717
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:28,184
No.

718
01:03:28,977 --> 01:03:31,187
I mean, I know I must have them.

719
01:03:32,981 --> 01:03:35,525
And wherever they are,
I'm sure they miss me...

720
01:03:35,608 --> 01:03:38,778
but I can't miss them because
I don't remember them.

721
01:03:44,158 --> 01:03:47,579
What do you think you're gonna
find out there tomorrow?

722
01:03:49,789 --> 01:03:51,457
I don't know.

723
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:57,422
But if there's a way out, Chuck,
me and Minho are gonna find it.

724
01:04:03,428 --> 01:04:04,762
Here.

725
01:04:10,518 --> 01:04:12,979
Chuck, why would you give this to me?

726
01:04:15,023 --> 01:04:17,150
I can't remember them anyway.

727
01:04:18,735 --> 01:04:22,488
But maybe if you find a way out,
you can give it to them for me.

728
01:04:24,741 --> 01:04:26,784
I'll let you get some sleep.

729
01:04:36,085 --> 01:04:37,504
Hey, Chuck.

730
01:04:38,087 --> 01:04:39,422
Come here.

731
01:04:43,635 --> 01:04:45,345
Put out your hand.

732
01:04:47,263 --> 01:04:49,933
I want you to give
that to them yourself.

733
01:04:51,559 --> 01:04:53,144
We're gonna get out of here.

734
01:04:53,269 --> 01:04:54,646
All of us.

735
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:56,981
Okay?

736
01:04:57,482 --> 01:04:59,150
I promise.

737
01:05:01,319 --> 01:05:02,987
- Yeah.
- All right.

738
01:05:04,405 --> 01:05:06,699
- Good night.
- Good night, buddy.

739
01:05:21,965 --> 01:05:25,718
Big day, Greenie. Are you sure
you don't wanna sit this one out?

740
01:05:25,844 --> 01:05:27,554
Come on, man. Get me out of here.

741
01:05:27,679 --> 01:05:28,972
All right.

742
01:05:47,031 --> 01:05:48,283
Let's go!

743
01:05:59,878 --> 01:06:01,921
This way. Not much further
to the inner ring.

744
01:06:02,005 --> 01:06:03,548
Let's go!

745
01:06:06,593 --> 01:06:08,219
Come on! This way.

746
01:06:33,995 --> 01:06:35,663
That's strange.

747
01:06:35,747 --> 01:06:36,915
What?

748
01:06:36,998 --> 01:06:40,043
Seven is not supposed to
be open for another week.

749
01:06:46,591 --> 01:06:49,385
What the hell is this place?

750
01:06:49,511 --> 01:06:51,346
We call them blades.

751
01:07:10,156 --> 01:07:12,200
It's Ben's, isn't it?

752
01:07:12,283 --> 01:07:13,910
Yeah.

753
01:07:14,827 --> 01:07:17,497
A Griever must have
pulled him down here.

754
01:07:24,087 --> 01:07:25,630
Whoa, hey!

755
01:07:47,485 --> 01:07:49,737
I think it's showing us the way.

756
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,161
Wait, wait, wait.

757
01:07:57,287 --> 01:07:58,746
What, what?

758
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:02,876
This way. Come on.

759
01:08:26,232 --> 01:08:29,194
Minho, you ever see
this place before?

760
01:08:30,486 --> 01:08:32,030
No.

761
01:08:53,384 --> 01:08:55,553
It's just another dead end.

762
01:09:22,872 --> 01:09:24,749
Are you sure about this?

763
01:09:28,044 --> 01:09:29,462
Nope.

764
01:10:03,246 --> 01:10:04,914
Grievers.

765
01:10:16,759 --> 01:10:18,636
What the hell was that?

766
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:25,852
We gotta get out of here.

767
01:10:25,935 --> 01:10:28,271
Give me the key, give me the key!

768
01:10:33,484 --> 01:10:34,903
Move, move!

769
01:10:41,409 --> 01:10:43,161
We gotta go! Run, Thomas!

770
01:10:43,286 --> 01:10:44,954
We're gonna get trapped!

771
01:10:45,079 --> 01:10:46,497
Go! Go!

772
01:10:50,752 --> 01:10:51,961
Go, go, go!

773
01:10:52,086 --> 01:10:53,296
Move!

774
01:11:03,139 --> 01:11:04,182
Minho!

775
01:11:04,307 --> 01:11:06,309
Come on! Let's go, let's go!

776
01:11:10,772 --> 01:11:11,814
Come on, move!

777
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:14,150
Keep going! Keep going! Let's go!

778
01:11:15,944 --> 01:11:17,529
Go, go, go!

779
01:11:32,669 --> 01:11:34,003
Go, go, go!

780
01:11:41,636 --> 01:11:43,513
Come on! Don't look back!

781
01:11:48,184 --> 01:11:49,686
Come on!

782
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:53,898
Oh, shit!

783
01:11:55,191 --> 01:11:56,568
There!

784
01:12:17,046 --> 01:12:18,506
What the hell's going on out there?

785
01:12:18,590 --> 01:12:19,883
What the hell you done now, Thomas?

786
01:12:20,008 --> 01:12:22,844
We found something, a new passage.
We think it could be a way out.

787
01:12:22,927 --> 01:12:24,721
- Really?
- It's true.

788
01:12:24,846 --> 01:12:27,348
We opened a door,
something I'd never seen before.

789
01:12:27,432 --> 01:12:29,142
I think it must be where the
Grievers go during the day.

790
01:12:29,225 --> 01:12:30,476
Wait!

791
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,812
You're saying you found
the Grievers' home?

792
01:12:32,896 --> 01:12:34,105
And you want us to go in?

793
01:12:34,230 --> 01:12:35,773
Their way in could be
our way out, Chuck.

794
01:12:35,899 --> 01:12:38,318
Yeah, or there could be a dozen
Grievers on the other side.

795
01:12:38,401 --> 01:12:41,696
The truth is, Thomas doesn't
know what he has done, as usual.

796
01:12:41,779 --> 01:12:44,782
Yeah, at least I did something, Gally.
I mean, what have you done?

797
01:12:44,908 --> 01:12:46,951
Aside from hide behind
these walls all the time?

798
01:12:47,076 --> 01:12:48,411
Let me tell you something, Greenie.

799
01:12:48,536 --> 01:12:51,206
You've been here 3 days, all right?
I've been here 3 years!

800
01:12:51,289 --> 01:12:53,541
Yeah, you've been here 3 years
and you're still here, Gally!

801
01:12:53,625 --> 01:12:54,751
What does that tell you?

802
01:12:54,876 --> 01:12:56,377
Maybe you should start doing
things a little differently.

803
01:12:56,461 --> 01:12:58,630
Maybe you should be
in charge, what about that?

804
01:12:58,755 --> 01:13:00,798
Hey, it's Alby!

805
01:13:01,090 --> 01:13:03,301
He's awake.

806
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:05,470
Has he said anything?

807
01:13:05,595 --> 01:13:06,971
No.

808
01:13:08,389 --> 01:13:10,141
Alby...

809
01:13:13,394 --> 01:13:15,355
Alby, are you all right?

810
01:13:21,402 --> 01:13:23,738
Hey, Alby.

811
01:13:26,199 --> 01:13:29,369
Alby, we might have just found
a way out of the maze.

812
01:13:29,953 --> 01:13:33,081
Do you hear me? We could
be getting out of here.

813
01:13:34,916 --> 01:13:37,043
We can't.

814
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:40,463
We can't leave.

815
01:13:41,464 --> 01:13:43,508
They won't let us.

816
01:13:43,633 --> 01:13:45,635
What are you talking about?

817
01:13:46,052 --> 01:13:47,512
I remember.

818
01:13:51,307 --> 01:13:53,601
What do you remember?

819
01:13:55,103 --> 01:13:56,771
You.

820
01:14:00,942 --> 01:14:03,528
You were always
their favorite, Thomas.

821
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:05,321
Always.

822
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,910
Why did you do this?

823
01:14:11,744 --> 01:14:14,289
Why did you come here?

824
01:14:24,716 --> 01:14:25,717
Winston, what's going on?

825
01:14:25,842 --> 01:14:28,219
It's the doors. They aren't closing.

826
01:15:20,897 --> 01:15:25,068
Chuck, go to the Council Hall
and start barricading the doors.

827
01:15:25,151 --> 01:15:26,986
- Winston, you go with him.
- Got it.

828
01:15:27,070 --> 01:15:29,822
Get the others. Tell them to go
to the forest. Go hide, now!

829
01:15:29,906 --> 01:15:31,950
Minho, I want you to grab
every weapon you can find.

830
01:15:32,075 --> 01:15:34,536
- I'll meet you at Council Hall.
- Let's go.

831
01:15:35,119 --> 01:15:39,207
Teresa, you and I are gonna go
get Alby, all right? Come on.

832
01:15:46,297 --> 01:15:48,550
All right, everybody hide!

833
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:49,759
Teresa!

834
01:15:49,884 --> 01:15:53,096
Come on! Run! Run!

835
01:16:01,396 --> 01:16:02,438
Stay down!

836
01:16:02,564 --> 01:16:03,857
Run!

837
01:16:18,288 --> 01:16:19,622
Zart!

838
01:16:23,209 --> 01:16:24,169
Help me!

839
01:16:24,294 --> 01:16:26,337
Go! Get to the village!

840
01:16:33,011 --> 01:16:34,804
Go, go, go!

841
01:16:41,102 --> 01:16:42,937
Stay down, stay down!

842
01:16:43,146 --> 01:16:45,899
Gally! Let me in, let me in!

843
01:16:52,488 --> 01:16:53,239
Alby!

844
01:16:53,323 --> 01:16:54,324
Are you okay?

845
01:16:54,407 --> 01:16:55,742
What's going on?

846
01:16:55,825 --> 01:16:56,826
They're here.

847
01:16:56,910 --> 01:16:58,244
Grievers?

848
01:17:04,501 --> 01:17:06,002
Thomas, what do we do?

849
01:17:06,127 --> 01:17:07,754
It's got me!

850
01:17:13,301 --> 01:17:14,677
Everybody, run, run, run!

851
01:17:14,761 --> 01:17:16,721
Jeff, come on, go, go, go!

852
01:17:31,569 --> 01:17:33,947
Everyone, go, go, go!

853
01:17:50,755 --> 01:17:53,341
Keep moving! Oh, shit!

854
01:17:54,509 --> 01:17:56,135
Alby!

855
01:17:56,302 --> 01:17:57,762
Get behind me!

856
01:18:00,723 --> 01:18:02,559
Come on!

857
01:18:05,395 --> 01:18:06,729
Over here, let's go!

858
01:18:06,855 --> 01:18:09,649
Over here! Let's go! Come on!

859
01:18:11,734 --> 01:18:13,027
Over here, come on!

860
01:18:13,111 --> 01:18:14,571
Winston!

861
01:18:14,654 --> 01:18:16,239
Get Alby inside.

862
01:18:16,781 --> 01:18:18,741
Chuck, get in! Go, go, go!

863
01:18:20,368 --> 01:18:22,412
Lock down the doors!

864
01:18:38,344 --> 01:18:39,554
Careful.

865
01:18:42,682 --> 01:18:44,267
Stay back, guys.

866
01:19:10,293 --> 01:19:12,128
Is everyone all right?

867
01:19:12,462 --> 01:19:14,297
Help!

868
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:16,341
- Hey, grab him!
- Help!

869
01:19:19,135 --> 01:19:20,553
Watch out!

870
01:19:27,018 --> 01:19:28,311
Chuck!

871
01:19:30,730 --> 01:19:32,398
- Chuck, no!
- Grab him!

872
01:19:32,482 --> 01:19:33,983
Pull him back!

873
01:19:34,984 --> 01:19:36,653
- Help!
- Chuck, don't let go!

874
01:19:36,736 --> 01:19:38,488
No shit!

875
01:19:38,571 --> 01:19:40,573
- Pull!
- Don't let him go!

876
01:20:01,594 --> 01:20:04,055
- Chuck, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

877
01:20:05,682 --> 01:20:07,141
Thanks, Alby.

878
01:20:08,268 --> 01:20:09,853
Alby! Watch out!

879
01:20:11,896 --> 01:20:13,147
Grab him!

880
01:20:16,609 --> 01:20:18,903
Thomas, get them out.

881
01:20:20,989 --> 01:20:21,990
Alby!

882
01:20:22,073 --> 01:20:23,658
No!

883
01:20:23,741 --> 01:20:24,742
Thomas...

884
01:20:24,868 --> 01:20:26,494
- Thomas!
- Don't go out there!

885
01:20:26,578 --> 01:20:27,704
No, Thomas, wait!

886
01:20:27,996 --> 01:20:29,622
Thomas, wait!

887
01:20:37,714 --> 01:20:39,340
Where is everybody?

888
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:41,342
Who's that over there?

889
01:20:48,141 --> 01:20:49,350
Gally...

890
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:52,729
This is all you, Thomas!

891
01:20:52,812 --> 01:20:53,688
Look around!

892
01:20:53,771 --> 01:20:55,440
Back off, Gally!
It's not Thomas' fault!

893
01:20:55,565 --> 01:20:56,566
You heard what Alby said!

894
01:20:56,649 --> 01:20:57,901
- He's one of them!
- One of who?

895
01:20:57,984 --> 01:21:02,155
He's one of them, and they sent him here
to destroy everything, and now he has!

896
01:21:02,238 --> 01:21:04,824
Look around, Thomas! Look around!

897
01:21:04,908 --> 01:21:05,992
This is your fault!

898
01:21:06,075 --> 01:21:07,785
Back off, Gally!
This is not Thomas' fault!

899
01:21:07,911 --> 01:21:10,830
What are you talking about?
Calm down.

900
01:21:12,498 --> 01:21:14,834
They sent him here, and now he's
destroyed everything that we've built!

901
01:21:14,918 --> 01:21:16,961
What are you talking about?

902
01:21:18,421 --> 01:21:20,131
Maybe he's right.

903
01:21:20,256 --> 01:21:22,217
Thomas...

904
01:21:23,134 --> 01:21:25,720
I need to remember, Teresa.

905
01:21:25,845 --> 01:21:27,388
Thomas...

906
01:21:27,472 --> 01:21:28,473
Thomas!

907
01:21:28,598 --> 01:21:29,849
No, don't!

908
01:21:30,683 --> 01:21:32,393
Thomas!

909
01:21:32,477 --> 01:21:34,604
Chuck, get the other syringe!

910
01:21:34,812 --> 01:21:36,523
It's okay.

911
01:21:36,606 --> 01:21:38,525
Thomas, I'm here.

912
01:21:49,661 --> 01:21:51,246
Who put us here?

913
01:21:52,288 --> 01:21:53,998
That we don't know.

914
01:21:58,837 --> 01:22:00,088
Teresa...

915
01:22:00,171 --> 01:22:02,090
why are we doing this?

916
01:22:05,718 --> 01:22:08,555
Excellent, Thomas. Come with me.

917
01:22:09,681 --> 01:22:10,682
Wicked isn't good.

918
01:22:10,807 --> 01:22:13,601
Thomas... Wicked is good.

919
01:22:14,686 --> 01:22:17,188
- How could this be my fault?
- You did this!

920
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:19,023
I saw you!

921
01:22:20,650 --> 01:22:23,194
I can't keep watching them die.

922
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:30,702
Hey.

923
01:22:31,828 --> 01:22:33,705
Are you okay?

924
01:22:35,915 --> 01:22:38,168
What the hell were you thinking?

925
01:22:43,339 --> 01:22:44,799
What happened?

926
01:22:45,216 --> 01:22:47,135
Gally has taken control.

927
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,805
He said we had a choice.
Either join him...

928
01:22:50,889 --> 01:22:53,766
or get banished at sundown with you.

929
01:22:55,185 --> 01:22:57,353
And the others agreed to that?

930
01:22:58,229 --> 01:23:02,442
Gally has everyone convinced that
you're the reason all this has happened.

931
01:23:04,861 --> 01:23:07,405
Well, he's been right so far.

932
01:23:08,781 --> 01:23:10,783
What are you talking about?

933
01:23:11,284 --> 01:23:13,244
This place...

934
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:16,414
it's not what we thought it was.

935
01:23:17,790 --> 01:23:20,460
It's not a prison, it's a test.

936
01:23:21,044 --> 01:23:23,379
It all started when we were kids.

937
01:23:24,130 --> 01:23:27,133
They would give us these challenges.

938
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:30,303
They were experimenting on us.

939
01:23:31,221 --> 01:23:34,349
And then people started disappearing.

940
01:23:34,432 --> 01:23:37,435
Every month, one after
the other, like clockwork.

941
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:40,021
They were sending them
up into the maze.

942
01:23:40,104 --> 01:23:42,524
Yeah, but not all of us.

943
01:23:42,899 --> 01:23:44,859
What do you mean?

944
01:23:47,904 --> 01:23:49,781
Guys, I'm one of them.

945
01:23:52,075 --> 01:23:55,036
The people who put you here,
I worked with them.

946
01:23:56,412 --> 01:23:59,374
I watched you guys for years.

947
01:23:59,666 --> 01:24:02,460
The entire time you have been here...

948
01:24:02,585 --> 01:24:04,796
I was on the other side of it.

949
01:24:07,423 --> 01:24:08,967
So were you.

950
01:24:10,635 --> 01:24:12,011
What?

951
01:24:13,429 --> 01:24:15,974
Teresa, we did this to them.

952
01:24:17,767 --> 01:24:19,185
No.

953
01:24:20,270 --> 01:24:21,938
That can't be true.

954
01:24:22,021 --> 01:24:25,567
It is. I saw it.

955
01:24:27,110 --> 01:24:29,779
Why would they send us
up if we were with them?

956
01:24:29,863 --> 01:24:31,656
It doesn't matter.

957
01:24:32,824 --> 01:24:34,492
He's right.

958
01:24:36,953 --> 01:24:38,830
It doesn't matter.

959
01:24:39,372 --> 01:24:41,332
Any of it.

960
01:24:42,292 --> 01:24:46,337
Because the people we were before
the maze don't even exist anymore.

961
01:24:46,462 --> 01:24:48,715
These Creators took care of that.

962
01:24:49,716 --> 01:24:53,428
But what does matter is who
we are now, and what we do...

963
01:24:53,511 --> 01:24:55,388
right now.

964
01:24:56,222 --> 01:24:59,100
You went into the maze
and you found a way out.

965
01:24:59,184 --> 01:25:02,520
Yeah, but if I hadn't,
Alby would still be alive.

966
01:25:05,732 --> 01:25:07,400
Maybe.

967
01:25:10,820 --> 01:25:15,909
But I know that if he were here,
he would be telling you the exact same thing.

968
01:25:16,826 --> 01:25:20,288
Pick your ass up and
finish what you started.

969
01:25:22,248 --> 01:25:23,625
Because if we do nothing...

970
01:25:23,708 --> 01:25:27,295
then that means Alby died for
nothing, and I can't have that.

971
01:25:31,382 --> 01:25:33,092
Okay.

972
01:25:34,677 --> 01:25:38,056
Okay, but we gotta get
through Gally first.

973
01:26:07,043 --> 01:26:09,170
This is such a waste.

974
01:26:14,717 --> 01:26:16,135
Gally...

975
01:26:20,765 --> 01:26:22,934
It doesn't feel right, man.

976
01:26:23,893 --> 01:26:26,521
Yeah, what if Thomas is right?

977
01:26:27,146 --> 01:26:29,440
Maybe he can lead us home.

978
01:26:31,442 --> 01:26:33,653
We are home.

979
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:35,947
Okay?

980
01:26:36,990 --> 01:26:40,034
I don't wanna have to cross
any more names off that wall.

981
01:26:40,118 --> 01:26:43,997
You really think banishing
us is gonna solve anything?

982
01:26:44,539 --> 01:26:46,124
No.

983
01:26:47,083 --> 01:26:49,252
But this isn't a banishing.

984
01:26:50,044 --> 01:26:51,129
It's an offering.

985
01:26:51,254 --> 01:26:55,258
What? Wait!
Gally, what are you doing?

986
01:26:55,383 --> 01:26:59,929
You really think I'm gonna let Thomas back
into the maze after what he has done?

987
01:27:00,805 --> 01:27:02,682
Look around you!

988
01:27:03,766 --> 01:27:05,393
Look at our Glade!

989
01:27:06,477 --> 01:27:09,480
This is the only way.

990
01:27:09,606 --> 01:27:13,109
And when the Grievers get
what they came here for...

991
01:27:13,484 --> 01:27:15,653
everything goes back
to the way it was.

992
01:27:15,778 --> 01:27:17,071
Are you listening to this?

993
01:27:17,155 --> 01:27:19,616
Why are you all just standing there?
He's crazy!

994
01:27:19,699 --> 01:27:20,575
You shut up.

995
01:27:20,658 --> 01:27:23,328
If you stay here, the Grievers
are going to come back.

996
01:27:23,453 --> 01:27:25,163
They're gonna come back,
and they're gonna keep coming back...

997
01:27:25,288 --> 01:27:26,539
until you're all dead!

998
01:27:26,623 --> 01:27:28,666
Shut up! Tie him up!

999
01:27:30,126 --> 01:27:32,462
Do you hear me? I said tie him up!

1000
01:27:57,153 --> 01:27:59,030
You're full of surprises, aren't you?

1001
01:27:59,155 --> 01:28:02,242
You don't have to come
with us, but we are leaving.

1002
01:28:02,325 --> 01:28:04,661
Anyone else who wants to come,
now is your last chance.

1003
01:28:04,786 --> 01:28:06,371
Don't listen to him,
he's just trying to scare you.

1004
01:28:06,496 --> 01:28:09,207
No, I'm not trying to scare you.
You're already scared.

1005
01:28:09,332 --> 01:28:11,209
I'm scared.

1006
01:28:13,628 --> 01:28:17,882
But I'd rather risk my life out there
than spending the rest of it in here.

1007
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:21,261
We don't belong here.

1008
01:28:21,678 --> 01:28:24,597
This place isn't our home.

1009
01:28:25,306 --> 01:28:27,225
We were put here.

1010
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:29,185
We were trapped here.

1011
01:28:30,687 --> 01:28:33,189
At least, out there we have a choice.

1012
01:28:35,149 --> 01:28:37,443
We can make it out of here.

1013
01:28:38,486 --> 01:28:39,863
I know that.

1014
01:28:52,876 --> 01:28:54,627
I'm sorry.

1015
01:29:08,183 --> 01:29:10,768
Gally, it's over.

1016
01:29:13,229 --> 01:29:15,899
Just come with us.

1017
01:29:23,406 --> 01:29:25,909
Good luck against the Grievers.

1018
01:29:44,427 --> 01:29:46,179
Everybody, this way!

1019
01:30:00,068 --> 01:30:02,529
Keep it up, guys, we're almost there!

1020
01:30:16,334 --> 01:30:17,710
Is it a Griever?

1021
01:30:17,794 --> 01:30:19,212
Yeah.

1022
01:30:19,963 --> 01:30:21,464
Shit.

1023
01:30:21,673 --> 01:30:24,384
You take this, Chuck. Stay behind us.

1024
01:30:26,261 --> 01:30:29,055
It's okay. Just stick with me.

1025
01:30:29,931 --> 01:30:32,892
Once we're through, it will
activate and the door will open.

1026
01:30:32,976 --> 01:30:35,144
We stay close, we stick together...

1027
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:37,605
we get through this.
We get out now...

1028
01:30:37,689 --> 01:30:39,983
or we die trying.

1029
01:30:40,775 --> 01:30:42,068
Ready?

1030
01:30:43,319 --> 01:30:45,530
All right. Let's go!

1031
01:31:00,795 --> 01:31:02,505
Get up, look out!

1032
01:31:05,466 --> 01:31:06,676
Push it!

1033
01:31:11,848 --> 01:31:13,016
Look out!

1034
01:31:21,941 --> 01:31:23,109
The key!

1035
01:31:23,193 --> 01:31:24,194
Chuck!

1036
01:31:24,319 --> 01:31:25,820
Watch the edge!

1037
01:31:32,368 --> 01:31:33,578
Oh, no.

1038
01:31:34,871 --> 01:31:36,998
- I got you, Chuck!
- Pull me up!

1039
01:31:47,509 --> 01:31:48,843
Come on!

1040
01:31:49,219 --> 01:31:51,763
Thomas! Thomas!

1041
01:31:52,222 --> 01:31:53,223
Chuck?

1042
01:31:53,306 --> 01:31:54,974
We got more coming!

1043
01:31:56,226 --> 01:31:58,436
Keep it steady, guys!

1044
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:01,773
It works!

1045
01:32:03,399 --> 01:32:04,943
Teresa, go!

1046
01:32:08,530 --> 01:32:10,114
Don't back down! Keep pushing!

1047
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:11,699
Stay together!

1048
01:32:15,870 --> 01:32:18,289
There's gotta be a way out! Come on!

1049
01:32:25,171 --> 01:32:26,422
Watch it!

1050
01:32:31,427 --> 01:32:33,638
It won't open!

1051
01:32:36,641 --> 01:32:37,642
Thomas!

1052
01:32:37,767 --> 01:32:39,102
There's a code!

1053
01:32:39,227 --> 01:32:40,687
Eight numbers!

1054
01:32:42,730 --> 01:32:44,107
Eight sections of the maze.

1055
01:32:44,190 --> 01:32:46,109
Hey, Minho! What's the sequence?

1056
01:32:46,234 --> 01:32:47,193
What?

1057
01:32:47,277 --> 01:32:50,154
The sections of the maze,
what's the sequence?

1058
01:32:50,405 --> 01:32:52,115
Seven! One!

1059
01:32:52,532 --> 01:32:54,158
Five! Two!

1060
01:32:54,284 --> 01:32:55,285
Six! Four!

1061
01:32:55,368 --> 01:32:56,619
Heads up!

1062
01:32:58,788 --> 01:32:59,956
Minho!

1063
01:33:00,081 --> 01:33:01,374
Minho!

1064
01:33:03,918 --> 01:33:05,378
Get off of me!

1065
01:33:14,470 --> 01:33:15,972
Jeff!

1066
01:33:18,474 --> 01:33:19,976
What's the sequence? Come on!

1067
01:33:20,101 --> 01:33:21,060
Six!

1068
01:33:21,144 --> 01:33:22,645
Four! Eight!

1069
01:33:22,770 --> 01:33:24,480
Three! You got it?

1070
01:33:26,065 --> 01:33:27,650
Keep holding!

1071
01:33:27,775 --> 01:33:29,861
Almost there, come on!

1072
01:33:29,986 --> 01:33:31,529
The door opened!

1073
01:34:58,074 --> 01:34:59,659
Seriously?

1074
01:35:43,203 --> 01:35:44,871
What happened here?

1075
01:36:18,655 --> 01:36:20,698
So they were watching us.

1076
01:36:21,699 --> 01:36:23,535
This whole time.

1077
01:36:49,060 --> 01:36:50,603
Hello.

1078
01:36:50,687 --> 01:36:53,064
My name is Doctor Ava Paige.

1079
01:36:53,314 --> 01:36:58,319
I'm Director of Operations of the World
Catastrophe Killzone Department.

1080
01:36:58,403 --> 01:37:03,116
If you're watching this, that means you have
successfully completed the Maze Trials.

1081
01:37:03,366 --> 01:37:06,703
I wish I could be there in
person to congratulate you...

1082
01:37:08,204 --> 01:37:12,125
But circumstances seem
to have prevented it.

1083
01:37:12,208 --> 01:37:15,253
I'm sure by now, you must
all be very confused...

1084
01:37:15,545 --> 01:37:16,671
angry...

1085
01:37:16,754 --> 01:37:18,339
frightened.

1086
01:37:18,423 --> 01:37:22,177
I can only assure you, that
everything that's happened to you...

1087
01:37:22,552 --> 01:37:25,054
everything we've done to you...

1088
01:37:25,180 --> 01:37:27,390
it was all done for a reason.

1089
01:37:27,891 --> 01:37:29,684
You won't remember...

1090
01:37:29,767 --> 01:37:32,729
but the Sun has scorched our world.

1091
01:37:34,355 --> 01:37:37,066
Billions of lives lost to fire...

1092
01:37:37,734 --> 01:37:38,902
famine...

1093
01:37:39,235 --> 01:37:42,238
suffering on a global scale.

1094
01:37:42,363 --> 01:37:45,575
The fallout was unimaginable.

1095
01:37:46,117 --> 01:37:48,953
What came after was worse.

1096
01:37:49,579 --> 01:37:51,414
We called it the Flare.

1097
01:37:52,248 --> 01:37:55,752
A deadly virus that
attacks the brain.

1098
01:37:55,835 --> 01:37:57,754
It is violent...

1099
01:37:57,837 --> 01:37:59,589
unpredictable...

1100
01:38:00,215 --> 01:38:02,300
incurable.

1101
01:38:03,384 --> 01:38:05,136
Or so we thought.

1102
01:38:06,596 --> 01:38:10,934
In time, a new generation emerged
that could survive the virus.

1103
01:38:11,017 --> 01:38:14,729
Suddenly, there was a
reason to hope for a cure.

1104
01:38:15,897 --> 01:38:18,525
But finding it would not be easy.

1105
01:38:18,608 --> 01:38:21,945
The young would have to
be tested, even sacrificed...

1106
01:38:22,070 --> 01:38:24,280
inside harsh environments...

1107
01:38:24,405 --> 01:38:27,116
where their brain activity
could be studied.

1108
01:38:27,367 --> 01:38:28,952
All in an effort to understand...

1109
01:38:29,077 --> 01:38:31,454
what makes them different...

1110
01:38:32,455 --> 01:38:35,500
what makes you different.

1111
01:38:36,543 --> 01:38:38,628
You may not realize it...

1112
01:38:38,711 --> 01:38:41,297
but you're very important.

1113
01:38:41,464 --> 01:38:44,384
Unfortunately, your trials
have only just begun.

1114
01:38:44,467 --> 01:38:48,721
As you will no doubt soon discover,
not everyone agrees with our methods.

1115
01:38:48,805 --> 01:38:52,058
Progress is slow, people are scared.

1116
01:38:52,141 --> 01:38:54,727
It may be too late for us...

1117
01:38:54,811 --> 01:38:56,729
for me...

1118
01:38:56,813 --> 01:38:58,398
but not for you.

1119
01:38:59,065 --> 01:39:01,109
The outside world awaits.

1120
01:39:01,484 --> 01:39:03,111
Remember...

1121
01:39:06,322 --> 01:39:07,991
Wicked is good.

1122
01:39:43,526 --> 01:39:45,236
Is it over?

1123
01:39:46,863 --> 01:39:49,032
She said we were important.

1124
01:39:50,533 --> 01:39:52,744
What are we supposed to do now?

1125
01:40:01,127 --> 01:40:02,879
I don't know.

1126
01:40:08,134 --> 01:40:10,094
Let's get out of here.

1127
01:40:12,889 --> 01:40:14,098
No.

1128
01:40:18,311 --> 01:40:20,063
- Gally?
- Don't.

1129
01:40:21,022 --> 01:40:23,024
He's been stung.

1130
01:40:30,406 --> 01:40:31,950
We can't leave.

1131
01:40:35,703 --> 01:40:37,956
We did. Gally, we're out.

1132
01:40:38,873 --> 01:40:40,375
We're free.

1133
01:40:42,502 --> 01:40:43,878
Free?

1134
01:40:47,173 --> 01:40:49,384
You think we're free out there?

1135
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:51,970
No.

1136
01:40:53,763 --> 01:40:56,266
No, there's no escape
from this place.

1137
01:41:01,229 --> 01:41:02,772
Gally, listen to me.

1138
01:41:02,856 --> 01:41:05,316
You're not thinking straight.

1139
01:41:05,733 --> 01:41:07,110
You're not.

1140
01:41:07,777 --> 01:41:09,988
Now, we can help you.

1141
01:41:11,281 --> 01:41:13,491
Just put down the gun.

1142
01:41:14,075 --> 01:41:15,869
I belong to the maze.

1143
01:41:15,952 --> 01:41:17,912
Just put down the gun.

1144
01:41:20,748 --> 01:41:22,333
We all do.

1145
01:41:42,979 --> 01:41:44,480
Thomas...

1146
01:41:46,149 --> 01:41:47,775
Chuck.

1147
01:41:52,238 --> 01:41:54,282
Oh, shit. Shit.

1148
01:41:55,158 --> 01:41:56,993
Look at me, look at me!

1149
01:41:57,827 --> 01:41:58,870
Oh, shit!

1150
01:41:58,995 --> 01:42:00,663
Chuck, look at me, all right?

1151
01:42:00,788 --> 01:42:02,665
I got you, buddy. Just hang on.

1152
01:42:02,749 --> 01:42:04,375
It's okay.

1153
01:42:04,501 --> 01:42:06,211
Thomas, Thomas...

1154
01:42:11,466 --> 01:42:13,510
No, Chuck. You're gonna
give it to them yourself.

1155
01:42:13,635 --> 01:42:14,677
Remember, I told you that.

1156
01:42:14,761 --> 01:42:16,221
Take it.

1157
01:42:16,679 --> 01:42:18,014
No.

1158
01:42:20,350 --> 01:42:21,643
Thank you.

1159
01:42:25,355 --> 01:42:26,731
Thank you.

1160
01:42:26,856 --> 01:42:28,942
No, Chuck, you're gonna get...

1161
01:42:32,695 --> 01:42:33,863
Chuck.

1162
01:42:36,449 --> 01:42:38,201
Chuck? Hey.

1163
01:42:39,953 --> 01:42:41,913
Hey, Chuck, come on!

1164
01:42:42,664 --> 01:42:44,457
Come on, wake up!

1165
01:42:52,298 --> 01:42:53,508
Damn it!

1166
01:42:56,010 --> 01:42:58,137
We made it. Come on.

1167
01:43:02,892 --> 01:43:04,769
I'm sorry!

1168
01:43:05,895 --> 01:43:07,397
God damn it!

1169
01:43:08,731 --> 01:43:10,775
Damn it!

1170
01:43:16,656 --> 01:43:18,157
- Thomas.
- Chuck!

1171
01:43:21,452 --> 01:43:23,872
Get up, Chuck! Come on!

1172
01:43:36,801 --> 01:43:38,094
Chuck!

1173
01:43:39,470 --> 01:43:41,681
You can't just leave him there!

1174
01:44:19,260 --> 01:44:20,929
You guys all right?

1175
01:44:21,221 --> 01:44:22,430
Don't worry.

1176
01:44:22,514 --> 01:44:24,098
You're safe now.

1177
01:45:00,468 --> 01:45:02,262
Relax, kid.

1178
01:45:03,429 --> 01:45:05,974
Everything is gonna change.

1179
01:45:20,613 --> 01:45:24,409
I think it's safe to say the Maze
Trials were a complete success.

1180
01:45:25,577 --> 01:45:28,371
I wasn't expecting so
many survivors, but...

1181
01:45:29,289 --> 01:45:31,040
the more the merrier.

1182
01:45:34,669 --> 01:45:38,590
Thomas continues to
surprise and impress.

1183
01:45:39,716 --> 01:45:43,678
And for now, they seem
to have taken the bait.

1184
01:45:44,596 --> 01:45:46,723
It's too soon to say...

1185
01:45:48,224 --> 01:45:50,852
but they could be the
key to everything.

1186
01:45:53,229 --> 01:45:55,064
So let's move forward.

1187
01:45:56,316 --> 01:45:59,611
It's time now to begin Phase Two.
